      "content": "Coordinates and Proper Time\n1.\nIntroduction\nThese notes supplement Chapter 1 of EBH (Exploring Black Holes by Taylor and Wheeler).\nThey elaborate on the discussion of bookkeeper coordinates and how coordinates are related to\nactual physical distances and times. Also, a brief discussion of the classic Twin Paradox of special\nrelativity is presented in order to illustrate the principal of maximal (or extremal) aging.\nBefore going to details, let us review some jargon whose precise meaning will be important in\nwhat follows. You should be familiar with these words and their meaning. Spacetime is the four-\ndimensional playing field for motion. An event is a point in spacetime that is uniquely specified by\ngiving its four coordinates (e.g. t, x, y, z). Sometimes we will ignore two of the spatial dimensions,\nreducing spacetime to two dimensions that can be graphed on a sheet of paper, resulting in a\nMinkowski diagram. A worldline is a continuous, one-dimensional curve in spacetime. Generally\nspeaking, we only use the word \"worldline\" when referring to the path taken by a massive particle,\nwhich is restricted by relativity to travelling slower than the speed of light in vacuum. We will\nalways choose units so that c = 1; see EBH Section 1-2.\nA reference frame is defined by a set of spatial axes with a specified motion. For example, the\nreference frame of the Earth consists of a set of axes centered on the center of the Earth, so that\nthe Earth is always at rest in this frame. Reference frames may be global or local depending on\nwhether they are used to describe motion over all of spacetime or only close to the center of the\nframe, respectively. In Newtonian mechanics and special relativity, but not in general relativity,\nthere exists the concept of a global inertial frame in which Newton's laws of mechanics apply\neverywhere. As we will see, this is no longer the case in general relativity. Note that we often drop\nthe word \"reference\" from \"reference frame\".\n\n- 2 -\nReference frames are closely related to coordinate systems. Coordinate systems assign a set\nof labels to each event in spacetime (or point in space, if we are doing ordinary geometry without\ntreating time). Coordinate systems are very important in general relativity. They provide an\nunambiguous way to deal with motion and geometry even when global inertial reference frames no\nlonger exist.\nFor these reasons, in general relativity we will use coordinate systems instead of reference\nframes to provide the global description of motion in spacetime. However, local reference frames\nare very useful for interpreting motion as seen in the vicinity of an observer. Since we are all\nobservers, we must learn how to use both global coordinate systems and local reference frames.\n2.\nBookkeeper Coordinates in Special Relativity\nWe are used to thinking of coordinates like (t, x, y, z) as having direct, physical significance,\ni.e. as being measurable quantities. However, special relativity teaches us that the results of\nmeasurement depend on the observer's motion. There are no universal coordinates that give the\ndistances and times measured by all observers. Absolute space and time are a myth.\nSpecial relativity has a special class of reference frames known as global inertial reference\nframes. Coordinates in an inertial reference frame give physical times and distances as measured\nby an observer at rest in that frame. The coordinates of different inertial observers are related by\nLorentz transformations. For example, a Lorentz boost in the x-direction relates coordinates in the\ntwo different frames as follows\nt0 = γ(t - vx) , x = γ(x - vt) , y = y , z = z ,\n(1)\nwhere v is the relative velocity of the two frames and γ ≡ (1 - v2)-1/2 . There are many other\npossible Lorentz transformations (e.g., boosts along the y- or z-directions, and spatial rotations),\nbut this example is enough to make the point: coordinates are arbitrary labels assigned by us for our\nconvenience in locating events. EBH reinforces this point by calling them bookkeeper coordinates.\nLorentz transformations have the very important property of leaving invariant a quantity called\nthe interval. If two spacetime events have coordinates (t1, x1, y1, z1) and (t2, x2, y2, z2) respectively,\nthen the spacetime interval (in special relativity only) is\n(Δτ )2 = (t1 - t2)2 - (x1 - x2)2 - (y1 - y2)2 - (z1 - z2)2 .\n(2)\nIf you've had special relativity, you recognize this as the square of the proper time difference Δτ\nbetween the two spacetime events. (The proper time -- often called wristwatch time in EBH -- is\nthe physical time in an inertial reference frame in which both events are simultaneous.) Sometimes\nthe interval is defined to be the negative of this, or the square root; what is important is not the\nsign or the root but the fact that this combination is unchanged if the coordinates are Lorentz\n1, t2 with t0\ntransformed. (You can easily check this by replacing t1 with t0\n2, etc., and substituting\n\n- 3 -\neq. 1.) In fact, the Lorentz transformation is defined to be any linear transformation that leaves\nthe interval invariant.\nWhen the two spacetime points (events) are taken very close to each other, the spacetime\ninterval becomes the metric. The metric is a formula telling how infinitesimal increments of proper\ntime or proper distance are related to coordinate differentials. If the coordinate differences are\nwritten (dt, dx, dy, dz), the metric is\ndτ 2 = dt2 - (dx2 + dy2 + dz2) .\n(3)\nPlease note the unusual notation: dτ 2 is an abbreviation for (dτ )2 and not d(τ 2), and similarly for\nthe other terms in equation (3). This notation is universally used in general relativity.\nThe spatial part of the interval is recognizable from the Pythagorean theorem as the square of\nthe distance. As a physical quantity (the distance), it is, of course, independent of spatial rotations\nof the coordinates. Einstein taught us that this invariance of space extends to an invariance of\nspacetime with time as the fourth dimension (conventionally we list time as the first dimension).\nThe implications of this brilliant extension are the subject matter of special relativity, which we\nhope you have studied either in a class or on your own.\nIn one way, general relativity is simply the extension of special relativity to work with arbitrary\ncoordinate transformations. Special relativity uses Cartesian coordinates and the time measured\nin some inertial reference frame. General relativity is, as its name suggests, more general.\n3.\nCoordinate Transformations\nGeneral relativity drops the assumption that the spatial coordinates are Cartesian and the time\ncoordinate measures physical time for the simple reason that such coordinates are impossible in\ncurved spacetime. (More on this in Chapter 2 of EBH; for now, please take our word for it.) We must\ntherefore consider coordinates on curved spaces. A smooth space of any number of dimensions is\ncalled a manifold. According to general relativity, spacetime is a four-dimensional curved manifold.\nThere is a very important theorem of geometry: it is impossible to set up a global Cartesian\ncoordinate system, for which the Pythagorean theorem (or its extension to include time) holds, in\na curved manifold.\nEven in flat spaces, where Cartesian coordinates can be used, non-Cartesian coordinates are\nallowed. For example, in many applications it is more convenient to use polar instead of Cartesian\ncoordinates. It is therefore useful to review how various coordinates transform.\nWe can illustrate coordinate transformations graphically. Figure 1 shows a section of the plane\nwith four different coordinate systems. To make the discussion more interesting, we take the plane\nto be space-time rather than space-space; however the same concept of coordinate transformations\nwould apply equally well if this were the x-y plane.\n\n- 4 -\nx0 x1 x2 x3 x4\nx'0 x'1 x'2 x'3 x'4\nu1\nu2\nu4\nu3\nv1\nv3\nv2\nv4\nη1\nξ5\nξ6\nξ7\nξ8\nη5\nη4\nη3\nt'4\nt4\nt'3\nη2\nt3\nt'2\nt2\nt'1\nt1\nt'0\nt0\nξ1 ξ2 ξ3 ξ4\nFig. 1.-- Four coordinate systems for the spacetime plane.\nThe coordinate transformation relating (t0 , x0) to (t, x) is the Lorentz transformation of equa\ntion (1). The other two transformations are:\nu = t + x , v = t - x ,\n(4)\nand\nξ = ±|t2 - x 2|1/2 , η = arctan(t/x) .\n(5)\n√\n√\nIn this last case, we choose ξ = + x2 - t2 if x > t and ξ = - t2 - x2 if t > x.\nThe last two coordinate systems in Figure 1 are unusual but there is nothing wrong with them.\nThey assign unique labels to each event (point in the spacetime plane), and if two events have values\nof the coordinates that are very close, then the events are very close. The reverse, however, is not\ntrue everywhere for the fourth coordinate system: there exist events that are nearby in the plane\nyet have very different (η, ξ) coordinate values. Can you see where?\nAs an exercise in Assignment 2, you will work out the metric of Minkowski space for the\ncoordinate systems of Figure 1. The first case is simply dτ 2 = dt2 - dx2 . The other cases follow by\ncoordinate transformation. They have no particular physical significance; they are simply examples\nof non-Cartesian coordinate systems of bookkeeper coordinates.\n4.\nExample: Coordinates and Distances on the Sphere\nNext we consider the simplest case of a curved manifold, a two-dimensional sphere like the\nsurface of the earth. Everyone is familiar with latitude and longitude on the earth; they are coordi\nnates for the sphere. We call the longitude φ and the colatitude (i.e. the angle measured southward\nfrom the north pole) θ. If we have two points on a sphere of radius 1, with coordinates (θ1, φ1)\nand (θ2, φ2), what is the distance between them? You will answer this question in Assignment 2,\nwithout assuming that the two points are close to each other.\n\n- 5 -\nWhen the two points are very close, the distance between them gives the incremental distance\non the unit sphere:\nds2 = dθ2 + sin2 θdφ2 .\n(6)\nIt is conventional to call this formula the metric for a sphere. Thus, a metric exists for any manifold\nwhich has a rule for computing distances. (An example of a manifold without a metric is the P -V\ndiagram of thermodynamics.)\nIn equation (6) we use the symbol ds for proper distance, i.e. the physical distance between\ntwo nearby points (as opposed to the coordinate differential dθ or dφ). Notice that the Pythagorean\ntheorem does not work on a sphere: the distance is not (dθ)2+(dφ)2 . That is because the coordinates\nare not Cartesian. In fact, there is no Cartesian coordinate system for the sphere!\nYou might object that the Pythagorean theorem holds if we include the fact that the sphere\nexists in three dimensions, and we then use Cartesian coordinates to label the points. However, in\nthis case, one is no longer considering the sphere by itself -- one is considering a sphere embedded in\nthree-dimensional Euclidean space. We don't want to do that. We are concerned about the intrinsic\ngeometry of the two-dimensional surface of the sphere, and this requires only two coordinates. The\npoint is, the intrinsic geometry is non-Euclidean.\nAlthough it is impossible to find a two-dimensional globally Euclidean coordinate system for\nthe sphere (i.e., coordinates for which the Pythagorean theorem holds everywhere), it is possible\nto find coordinates that are locally Euclidean. That is why maps of cities and even countries can\nbe made on a flat page with little distortion. As an example, near the equator we can write x = φ,\nπ\ny = 2 - θ. The metric is\nds2 = dy2 + cos 2 y dx2 ≈ dy2 + dx2 ,\n(7)\nwhere the corrections are O(y2). (That is, as y → 0, the correction terms in the metric go to zero\nat least as fast as y2.) This means that, as long as y is not too large (i.e. one is not far from the\nequator), the coordinates are almost Cartesian. If one wishes nearly Cartesian coordinates that\nwork far away from the equator, it is only necessary to rotate the sphere to define a new equator.\nFor dy = 0, the physical distance along a meridian of longitude is ds = (cos y)dx. One\nmust not think of this physical distance as a coordinate distance (i.e. a bookkeeper distance).\nMathematically, one cannot define a coordinate by dξ = (cos y)dx and integrate it to get Euclidean\ncoordinates (ξ, y). (The cos y is the problem; y is not a function of x.) There is no coordinate\nsystem on the sphere for which the Pythagorean theorem holds everywhere. By extension of this\nargument, one can always find a local inertial frame in curved spacetime, but no inertial frame is\nglobal.\n\n- 6 -\nt\nt\n(t2, x2)\n(t, x)\nx\n(t1, x1)\nx\nFig. 2.-- Two views of the twin paradox, showing the worldlines of a twin moving at\nconstant speed and another who changes velocity during the trip. Left: one twin remains\nat rest while the other takes a roundtrip flight. Right: both twins move, although one\nhas constant speed. The intermediate point may be moved anywhere along the dashed\nline; the text shows which path has the maximal proper time.\n5.\nMaximize your Proper Time: The Twin Paradox\nAs a last example of coordinates and proper time, we examine the classic twin paradox of\nspecial relativity. The left panel of Figure 2 shows the trajectories of two twins in a Minkowski\n(spacetime) diagram. One twin stays home and ages by t2 - t1 ≡ T . Another twin travels at high\nspeed, first away from the earth and then back, and ages by T/γ where γ > 1 is the Lorentz factor.\nNote that the age is not the total length of the trajectory computed using the Pythagorean\ntheorem, even in special relativity. That is because, as equation (2) shows, space and time terms\nhave opposite signs in the metric. Both twins have the same elapsed bookkeeper time t. However,\nthe stay-at-home twin has dx = 0 while the moving twin has dx 6= 0 and therefore has less elapsed\nproper time. The moving twin's proper time is the same as the time measured by a wristwatch or\nany clock that she carries. The stationary twin ages more. If you are unfamiliar with the paradox\nand its resolution, please review a special relativity book.\nThe upshot of this thought experiment is that in the absence of forces, a particle takes the path\nof greatest proper time between fixed endpoints in a Minkowski diagram. To see this, consider a\ndifferent example, shown in the right panel of Figure 2. Now the first twin has a constant speed, i.e.\na constant slope in the spacetime diagram. The second twin first travels to some spatial coordinate\n\n- 7 -\nx, then reverses course to meet the other twin. Which twin ages more?\nTo answer this question, we let x be the variable x-coordinate of the turn-around event, and\nwe compute the age of the second twin as a function of x. We will see that this function has exactly\none maximum, and it occurs when x is chosen (with t fixed) so that the two paths overlap.\nThe age of the second twin is\nτ (x) = t - t1 + t2 - t\nwhere γ1 = (1 - v1 )-1/2 , γ2 = (1 - v2 )-1/2 .\n(8)\nγ1\nγ2\nUsing v1 = (x - x1)/(t - t1) and v2 = (x2 - x)/(t2 - t), we see that γ1 and γ2 are functions of x,\neverything else being a constant. It follows that\ndτ = γ2v2 - γ1v1 .\n(9)\ndx\nThis vanishes if and only if v1 = v2, i.e. the second twin has constant speed so her worldline is the\nstraight one shown in the figure. Taking the second derivative, one can show that d2τ/dx2 < 0.\nTherefore, the case v1 = v2 is a maximum. For fixed endpoints in a spacetime diagram, the path\nof constant speed is the path of maximal proper time. In Chapter 2 of EBH, this is elevated to\na principle: when no non-gravitational forces act on a body, the body follows a path of maximal\nproper time. For photons this can be a path of minimal proper time, so to cover all cases it is called\nthe principle of extremal aging. (An extremum of a function is a place where its first derivatives\nare zero: a maximum, a minimum, or a saddle point.)"

      "content": "Gravity, Metrics and Coordinates\n1.\nIntroduction\nThese notes supplement Chapter 2 of EBH (Exploring Black Holes by Taylor and Wheeler).\nThey provide several examples of metrics for realistic spacetimes and apply the concepts of coor-\ndinate transformations and local inertial frames discussed in the first set of notes, Coordinates and\nProper Time. You should focus on the mathematical issues here first, and not expect the equations\nto provide you immediately with wonderful intuitive understanding. It takes time and practice to\nlearn how to read a foreign language. Similarly it takes time and practice to learn how to read\na metric. These notes will provide you with some of the mathematical background along with a\nfew glittering examples of physical insight. First, however, we begin with a summary of Einstein's\ngreat insights that led to his revolutionary theory of gravity.\n2.\nGravity and Fields from Galileo to Einstein\nOur introduction to general relativity begins with a review of the key discoveries in physics\nwhich inspired Einstein. It is a huge conceptual leap to go from Newtonian gravity to general\nrelativity. Let us take a slow walk over the long bridge between these two theories.\nNewtonian gravitation is described by an inverse square law of force. This force can be obtained\nfrom the gravitational potential ΦN(x, t) by means of simple calculus.2 The gravitational potential\nis a scalar field, i.e. a single function defined at each spacetime event. The spatial gradient of the\npotential gives the gravitational force on a test particle:\nFg = -mg ∇ΦN = -mg\nμ∂φ\n∂xex + ∂φ\n∂yey + ∂φ\n∂z ez\n¶\n.\n(1)\n1Perfection is reached, not when there is no longer anything to add, but when there is no longer anything to take\naway.\n2The subscript N reminds us that this is the Newtonian potential.\n\n- 2 -\nYou should verify that the gravitational force due to a mass M arises from the potential ΦN =\n-GM/r with r =\np\nx2 + y2 + z2. We use the notation ex for the unit vector in the x-direction\n(and similarly for y and z).\nThe symbol mg is used for the gravitational mass, i.e.\nthe mass\nthat determines the gravitational force on a body. This is by contrast with the inertial mass mi\nappearing in Newton's second law of motion:\na = m-1\ni\nF ,\n(2)\nwhere a is the acceleration of a body subjected to force F. Combining equations (1) and (2) we\nsee that the acceleration of a body in a gravitational field depends on the ratio mg/mi:\na = -mg\nmi\n∇ΦN .\n(3)\nGalileo showed experimentally 400 years ago that all bodies accelerate exactly the same way in a\ngravitational field.3 Newton interpreted this result to imply the equivalence of gravitational and\ninertial mass, mi = mg.4\nWe are so used to the equivalence of inertial and gravitational masses that we drop the sub-\nscripts and refer only to the mass m. Einstein's first great insight was to realize that this result\nshould not be taken for granted, as it provides an important clue to the nature of gravity.\nTo see why Galileo's result is special, consider electric fields, which obey an inverse square\nlaw very similar to gravity. The acceleration caused by an electric field is proportional to q/mi\nwhere q is the test charge. However, the ratio q/mi is not the same for all bodies, unlike mg/mi.5\nEinstein realized the deep significance of mi = mg = m and adopted it as the centerpiece of his\nEquivalence Principle. By following the Equivalence Principle to its logical conclusion, Einstein\nwas able to develop the theory of General Relativity from pure thought.\nIn this class we will not follow Einstein's path in all its mathematical sophistication. However,\nwe will use the most important consequence of the Equivalence Principle, which provided the\nframework for Einstein's whole approach to combining gravity and relativity: Gravitational forces\nresult from the properties of spacetime itself.\nThis assumption is radical from the perspective of Newtonian mechanics where gravity is given\ninstantaneously by action at a distance and spacetime is nothing but the unchanging stage upon\nwhich all action takes place. According to Newton's laws, if you cross the street, the gravitational\nfield a million light years away changes instantaneously. Yet according to the special theory of\nrelativity, signals cannot travel infinitely fast. Newtonian gravity contradicts special relativity.\n3Galileo studied non-relativistically moving bodies. Had he been able to measure the accelerations of relativistically\nmoving objects, he would have found that the acceleration depends on v/c.\n4This conclusion assumes that the gravitational potential is independent of the mass of the test particle.\n5Consider, for example, a proton, neutron, and electron.\n\n- 3 -\nA similar puzzle arises with electromagnetism and it had been resolved by the work of Faraday\nand Maxwell. The electric force between two charges obeys an inverse square law so that moving\none charge in Boston would, according to Coulomb's law, instantaneously change the electric force\neverywhere in the universe.\nFaraday introduced the concept of a field of force which transmits the action of electricity\nor magnetism (and gravity) through space.\nMaxwell showed that changes in the field are not\npropagated instantaneously but instead travel at the speed of light. The static Coulomb law, and\nby extension the static inverse square law of gravitation, need to be modified when the sources are\nin motion.\nEinstein made a radical proposal: not only are gravitational effects carried by a field, but that\nfield is intimately related to the spacetime geometry itself. In general relativity, the spacetime metric\nitself plays the role of the field conveying all gravitational effects.6 The various terms in the metric\nare now to be regarded as functions of the spacetime coordinates following from the distribution of\ngravitational sources. We will devote the rest of this semester to exploring the metric and its effect\non motion. John Wheeler summarizes general relativity in one elegant sentence: \"Spacetime tells\nmatter how to move; matter tells spacetime how to curve.\"\nSpacetime is no longer the eternal, unchanging stage upon which all the world's dramas are\nplayed out. Spacetime itself is an actor. The choreography of stage and players makes general\nrelativity one of the most challenging -- and rewarding -- physical theories to master.\nHaving argued that all gravitational effects must be encoded in the metric itself, we are led to\nask how they are encoded in the metric. To answer this question we will examine a simple class of\nspacetime metrics around the structure of most interest in this course, the spherical black hole.\n3.\nStatic, Spherically Symmetric Spacetimes\nThe spacetimes around non-spinning stars and black holes are static and spherically symmetric\nto good accuracy. As a first step to studying the black hole metric, we provide a heuristic derivation\nof the general static, spherically symmetric metric.\nWe already know one static, spherically symmetric spacetime -- the flat spacetime of special\nrelativity. In Cartesian coordinates its metric is\ndτ 2 = dt2 -dx2 -dy2 -dz2 .\n(4)\nThis metric is static because the coefficients of the differentials are independent of t. To show that\n6The equivalence of inertial and gravitational masses crucially underlies this postulate. All bodies do not accelerate\nthe same way in an electric field;, implying that electric effects cannot arise from the metric alone.\n\n- 4 -\nit is spherically symmetric, we transform from Cartesian to spherical polar coordinates:\nx = r sin θ cos φ ,\ny = r sin θ sin φ ,\nz = r cos θ .\n(5)\nTaking the differentials (dx, dy, dz) and using the chain rule, one finds\ndx\n=\ndr sin θ cos φ + dθ r cos θ cos φ -dφ r sin θ sin φ ,\ndy\n=\ndr sin θ sin φ + dθ r cos θ sin φ + dφ r sin θ cos φ ,\n(6)\ndz\n=\ndr cos θ -dθ r sin θ .\nSubstituting this into equation (4) gives\ndτ 2 = dt2 -dr2 -r2dθ2 -r2 sin2 θ dφ2 .\n(7)\nWe now see the key feature of spherical symmetry: the polar angles (θ, φ) appear only in the\ncombination of the metric for a sphere, dθ2 + sin2 θ dφ2.\nThe most general static metric with spherical symmetry is obtained by adding more terms to\nthe metric (but none with θ and φ) and allowing the coefficients to depend on r:\ndτ 2 = e2Φ(r)dt2 -2A(r)dtdr -e2Λ(r)dr2 -r2e2B(r) ¡\ndθ2 + sin2 θ dφ2¢\n,\n(8)\nwhere Φ, Λ, A, and B are four arbitrary real functions of r. Note that Φ is not the same, in general,\nas the Newtonian gravitational potential ΦN.\nEquation (8) is actually too general. One of the most confusing aspects of general relativity\nfor the novice is the fact that coordinates may be freely transformed without changing the physics.\nA terrestrial analogy might be when new telephone area codes are introduced and one's telephone\nnumber changes. Our labels may change but we must still be able to call our friends! In general\nrelativity, however, the situation is more complicated: coordinates may be changed at any time,\nand sometimes several times during a calculation!\nWe can take advantage of this flexibility to simplify equation (8). In the homework, you will\nfind equations that must be obeyed by coordinate transformations t′(t, r) and r′(r) such that, in\nthe primed coordinates, equation (8) holds with A = B = 0. (The Φ and Λ fields may change but\nthey will still depend only on r.) Dropping the primes, we conclude that the most general static,\nspherically symmetric spacetime may be written in the form\ndτ 2 = e2Φ(r)dt2 -e2Λ(r)dr2 -r2 ¡\ndθ2 + sin2 θ dφ2¢\n.\n(9)\nThe radial coordinate r is sometimes called angular radius because it is used to related angular\ndifferentials to distance in the same way as in Euclidean space. For example, if we hold fixed t, r, and\nφ, the proper distance is ds = rdθ. (Recall that ds2 ≡-dτ 2.) It follows that the length of a great\ncircle is 2πr, motivating EBH to designate the r-coordinate reduced circumference. Note that all\nof the coordinates in the metric are bookkeeper coordinates -- they have no meaning independent\n\n- 5 -\nof the metric. The metric tells us how to measure distances and times - the coordinates do not! If\nyou never confuse r or t with physical distance and time, you will save yourself a lot of grief! The\nauthors of EBH are careful to put subscripts like shell on physical distances and times measured\nby shell observers. Bookkeeper coordinates have no subscripts.\n4.\nNewtonian and Einstein Field Equations\nIn Newtonian gravity, there is only one potential ΦN(x, t). In general relativity, for static,\nspherically symmetric spacetimes, there are two: Φ(r) and Λ(r). Before explaining why, we review\nthe field equations of Newtonian gravity.\nIn Newtonian gravity, the gravitational potential obeys a second-order partial differential equa-\ntion called the Poisson equation:\n∇2ΦN = 4πGρ .\n[Newton]\n(10)\nHere ∇2 = ∂2/∂x2 + ∂2/∂y2 + ∂2/∂z2 is the Laplace operator and ρ(x, t) is the mass density.\nEquation (10) is similar to Gauss's law of electromagnetism\n∇· E ≡∂Ex\n∂x + ∂Ey\n∂y + ∂Ez\n∂z = 4πρq ,\n[Coulomb]\n(11)\nwhere ρq(x ) is the charge density. Static electric fields, like Newtonian gravitational fields, follow\nfrom an electrostatic potential ΦE akin to equation (1): E = -∇ΦE. Combining this with Gauss's\nlaw gives ∇2ΦE = -4πρq.\nNot surprisingly, gravity obeys the same equation except that the\nelectric potential and charge are replaced by the gravitational potential and mass, with a sign\nchange because like positive charges repel while positive masses attract.\n(The factor G in the\ngravitational equation may be eliminated by a choice of units.)\nEquation (10) has a simple solution which we present without proof:\nΦN(x, t) = -G\nZ ρ(x ′, t) d3x′\n|x -x ′|\n.\n[Newton]\n(12)\nIf you haven't seen equations (10) or (12) before, don't worry; we won't be using them. However,\nwe will use the form of equation (10) that applies in spherical coordinates. If the mass density\nρ is independent of angles, then the potential is spherically symmetric and the Laplace operator\nsimplifies:\nr2\n∂\n∂r\nμ\nr2 ∂ΦN\n∂r\n¶\n= 4πGρ(r, t) .\n[Newton]\n(13)\nYou should be able to integrate this immediately to obtain\nΦN(r, t) =\nZ inf\nr\nGM(r′, t)\nr′2\ndr′ ,\nM(r, t) ≡\nZ r\nρ(r, t) 4πr′2dr′ .\n[Newton]\n(14)\n\n- 6 -\nNote that M(r, t) is the mass enclosed by a sphere of radius r. If the mass is concentrated at r = 0,\nthis immediately gives ΦN = -GM/r. Note also that a prime is put on the dummy variable of\nintegration because both M(r, t) and ΦN(r, t) are given by definite integrals. (The upper limit of\nintegration on ΦN is chosen so that ΦN →0 as r →inf.)\nIn General Relativity, the metric functions Φ and Λ in equation (9) obey a set of nonlinear\npartial differential equations first derived by Einstein and called the Einstein field equations in\nhis honor.\nWe will neither present a derivation of the Einstein field equations nor even state\ntheir general form.7 For the static, spherically symmetric metric of equation (9), these differential\nequations give the following:\nr2\nd\ndr\n£\nr\n¡\n1 -e-2Λ¢¤\n=\n8πGρ(r) ,\n[Einstein]\n(15a)\nr\ndΦ\ndr e-2Λ -1\nr2\n¡\n1 -e-2Λ¢\n=\n8πGp(r) .\n[Einstein]\n(15b)\nThese equations contain the mass-energy density ρ(r) and pressure p(r) of the medium responsible\nfor producing the gravity. They illustrate a key difference between General Relativity and Newto-\nnian gravity: In General Relativity, pressure is a source of gravity. The units of pressure are force\nper unit area, which is equivalent to energy per unit volume. Thus, p has the same units as ρc2.\n(The factor c2 is absent from eq. 15b because in these notes we always choose units so that c = 1.)\nBecause the metric function Φ(r) depends on pressure, it follows that pressure causes gravita-\ntional effects. You might wonder whether these are related to the ordinary pressure force that a gas\nexerts on the walls of its container. The answer is no -- the two effects are completely unrelated.\nThe ordinary pressure force depends only on pressure differences arising from the pressure gradient\n∇p. Equation (15b) says nothing at all about forces. It simply says that pressure causes spacetime\nto curve. We have said nothing yet about how gravitational force arises from spacetime curvature.\nThat will be the subject of next week's material.\nIf pressure and density both contribute to gravity, why do Newton's laws include only density?\nThe answer lies in the factor c2 relating the units of the two quantities. Using Einstein's famous\nformula E = mc2 and restoring the factors of c, the energy density of a nonrelativistic gas is ρc2.\nThe pressure has the same units, implying that pressure divided by density must be the square\nof some speed. For a nonrelativistic gas of molecules of mass m and number density n (molecules\nm-3), elementary thermodynamics gives us\np = nkT = ρkT\nm ≈ρc2\ns .\n(16)\nHere, k is the Boltzmann constant and cs is the sound speed of the gas.8 For a nonrelativistic gas,\n7After taking 8.224 and 8.07, you may wish to take 8.962 where the Einstein field equations and their solutions\nare investigated in detail.\n8For an ideal gas, c2\ns = γkT/m where γ is a constant close to one. For a diatomic gas, γ = 1.4.\n\n- 7 -\ncs ≪c so that the right-hand side of equation (15b) is orders of magnitude less than the right-hand\nside of equation (15a).\n5.\nSchwarzschild Metric and a Variation\nStarting from equations (15), as a homework exercise you will derive the metric for a spacetime\nwith p = 0 everywhere and a point mass M located at r = 0. The result is the famous Schwarzschild\nmetric:\ndτ 2 =\nμ\n1 -2GM\nr\n¶\ndt2 -\nμ\n1 -2GM\nr\n¶-1\ndr2 -r2 ¡\ndθ2 + sin2 θ dφ2¢\n.\n(17)\nThe factors of G may be removed simply by appropriate choice of units, as discussed in Section 2-6\nof EBH. EBH further restrict the discussion to the equatorial plane θ = π\n2 in which case dθ = 0.\nWe will not say more about the Schwarzschild metric now, because that will be the main\nbusiness for the next few weeks. However, we do wish to emphasize again that the coordinates\n(t, r, θ, φ) are simply bookkeeper coordinates with no physical significance by themselves. In General\nRelativity, the metric gives the coordinates meaning.\nTo show the non-uniqueness of the Schwarzschild coordinates, we will transform to a different\nset of coordinates which EBH call rain coordinates in Project B. (See pp. B-12 through B-14 in\nEBH.) The transformation proceeds as follows. First, we put primes on (t, r) in equation (17) --\nsince they are just bookkeeper coordinates, we are free to call them anything we want to. Then we\ntransform as follows:\nt′ = t + f(r) ,\nr′ = r ,\n(18)\nwhere f(r) is a function to be determined. Next, take the differentials: dt′ = dt + (df/dr)dr and\ndr′ = dr. Substituting into the Schwarzschild metric and grouping terms gives\ndτ 2 = Adt2 + 2df\ndrAdtdr -\n\"\nA-1 -A\nμdf\ndr\n¶2#\ndr2 -r2 ¡\ndθ2 + sin2 θ dφ2¢\n,\nA ≡1 -2GM\nr\n. (19)\nNow we impose a special condition on f(r): we require that, for dt = 0, the metric reduce to\nthe spatial metric of three-dimensional Euclidean space in spherical coordinates, as in equation (7).\nThis condition cannot be met for an arbitrary spacetime but, remarkably, for a non-rotating black\nhole it is possible. It is accomplished by requiring the term in square brackets in equation (19) to\nequal 1. This condition is satisfied if\n±f(r) =\nZ √\n2GMr dr\nr -2GM\n= 2\n√\n2GMr + 2GM ln\nA√r -\n√\n2GM\n√r +\n√\n2GM\n!\n.\n(20)\nWe are free to choose either sign for f.\nWith the choice of minus sign, the rain-frame metric\nbecomes\ndτ 2 =\nμ\n1 -2GM\nr\n¶\ndt2 -2\nr\n2GM\nr\ndtdr -dr2 -r2 ¡\ndθ2 + sin2 θ dφ2¢\n.\n(21)\n\n- 8 -\nEquation (21) looks quite different from equation (17). Yet both metrics describe the same\nspacetime!\nYou must not assume that, because both metrics use the same symbols (t, r, θ, φ),\nthese coordinates have the same meaning. The bookkeeper time for the two metrics is completely\ndifferent, as shown by equations (18) and (20). EBH choose to call the bookkeeper time in the\nrain coordinates train to avoid confusion with the bookkeeper time in Schwarzschild coordinates.\nEven without such subscripts, the bookkeeper coordinates become unambiguous once we specify\nthe metric. To badly paraphrase Hamlet,\nMore relative than this: the metric's the thing\nWherein we'll catch the coordinates' meaning.\nIn the next few weeks we will focus on the interpretation of the metric and coordinates. We\nwill find that the metric not only tells us almost everything that one can know about the structure\nof spacetime, but it also tells us everything we need to know about gravity."

For a\ncouple hundred dollars or less you can locate yourself within ten meters or so anywhere on\nEarth. These devices depend crucially on the accuracy of atomic clocks, since distance is\nmeasured by the travel time of radio waves. Light and radio waves move approximately one\nfoot per nanosecond. In Project A, The Global Positioning System, you will use general relativity\nto show that orbiting clocks drift tens of thousands of nanoseconds per day compared with\nclocks on the surface of Earth. If this relative drift is not corrected, the GPS is useless. When\nthe first GPS satellite was put into orbit, it had a \"general relativity on-off switch\" set to the\n\"off\" position, because the US military was not sure that academic advisors were right about\ngeneral relativity. The orbiting clocks drifted away from the Earth-clock readings at the rate\npredicted by the academics. So finally the military threw the general relativity switch to the\n\"on\" position. The rest is history. One example: By employing various tricks, geologists use\nthe GPS to measure drift of the Earth's continents in millimeters per year.\n\nPhysics 8.224, Spring 03\nAssignment Week 3\n\nREADING\nEBH Chapter 2: Curving, page 2-25 to the end\nAND\nProject A. The Global Positioning System\nAND\nThorne Chapter 2: The Warping of Space and Time\nAND\nNotes: \"Gravity, Metrics, and Coordinates\"\nEVENING SEMINAR\nBeginning of week #3\nRECITATION\n\nAt least one of the following questions will appear on the section quiz this week:\n1. The clock in the hand-held GPS receiver is much less accurate than the GPS atomic clocks in\norbit. How can the GPS system operate with such poor receiver clock accuracy?\n2. Observers on Earth's surface detect timing pulses from orbiting clocks to be increased in\nrate compared to that measured at the satellite.Is this increased rate due to orbiting clocks\nrunning fast or to the or blue shift of radio signals from the orbiting clocks as these signals\nmove downward? Explain your answer.\n3. Ions in the ionosphere create small random added delays in signal transmission between\nthe orbiting satellite and GPS receivers on Earth. In dense fog an airline pilot wants to\nmeasure his location with respect to an airfield. What technical advice can you give the\nairline and airport authorities that will greatly reduce the error due to transmission delays\nin the ionosphere?\n4. State Einstein's principle of relativity in a form satisfied by his general relativity.\n5. In teaching relativity we still use arguments presented by Einstein prior to 1912, but we\nuse few of his post-1912 arguments in our classrooms. What is the reason for this\ndifference, according to Thorne?\nPROJECTS\nBeginning of week #4 is the deadline for requesting approval from instructor for a\nproject topic not on the original list. Approval is tentative; an approved topic must later attract\nenough class members to form a team.\nPROBLEM SET\nSolve the following exercises in EBH PLUS additional exercises given below. Turn in byend of week #3.\nProblem 1. Astronaut Stretching According to Newton. Exercise 6, starting on page 2-46 in EBH.\nThis problem provides practice in using geometric units.\nPhysics 8.224, Spring 03\nAssignment Week 3\n\nProblem 2. Area of Black Hole Horizon (Almost!) Never Decreases, Exercise 8, page 2-48 of\nEBH. MODIFY parts A through C: One black hole has a mass Mo and the other a mass nMo,\nwhere n is an arbitrary integer. Set n = 2 in the following ADDED Parts D and E..\nD. Assume that the mass lost in the analysis of part B is escapes as gravitational radiation.\nWhat is the mass-equivalent of the energy of that gravitational radiation?\nE. The Caltech-MIT Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, LIGO, has\nbegun its search for gravitational wave sources. LIGO consists of two huge detectors\nnear Hanford, Washington and Livingston, Louisiana. At present, LIGO has its greatest\nsensitivity for gravitational waves oscillating with a frequency of about f = 100 Hz. LIGO\ndirectly measures a dimensionless quantity h known as the strain. Currently LIGO could\ndetect gravitational wave sources with h > 10-21. The energy flux in watts per square\nmeter carried by a gravitational wave is S = [c 3/(16πG)](dh/dt)2. What is the distance in\nlight years to the coalescing system of this exercise such that LIGO can barely detect the\nprocess? Assume (a) The value of M in the statement of the exercise is M = 10 times the\nmass of our Sun (b) the frequency of emitted gravitational radiation is equal to the\nfrequency of greatest sensitivity of LIGO, (c) the coalescence process takes one second,\n(d) the gravitational radiation is emitted isotropically (i.e. the same in all directions), and\n(e) the coalescing system is at rest with respect to Earth.\nProblem 3.

Metrics in Transformed Coordinates.\nDerive the metrics for the three new coordinate systems of Fig. 1 in the handout \"Coordinates\nand Proper Time\", starting from the metric dτ2 = dt2 - dx2.\nProblem 6. Distance between Two Points on a Sphere. (See the handout \"Coordinates and\nProper Time\".) Two points on a sphere of radius 1 have coordinates (θ1, φ1) and (θ2, φ2).\n(a) What is the distance between them, measured along a great circle arc on the surface of\nthe sphere? Do not assume that the two points are close to each other.\n(b) Now suppose that the two points are very close: θ2 = θ1+dθ, φ2 = φ1+dφ. Show that the\ndistance between the two points reproduces the metric for a sphere given in the notes.\nProblem 7. Static Spherical Metric.\nStarting from equation (9) of the second handout \"Gravity, Metrics, and Coordinates\", put primes\non the variables: (r',t',Φ ',Λ'). Then find expressions for the coordinate transformations t = t(t',r')\nand r = r(r') to a new set of coordinates giving the more general form, equation (8). For a given\nspacetime, is equation (9) unique? That is, are there any coordinate transformations that leave\nthe metric in the same form as equation (9)?\nPhysics 8.224, Spring 03\nAssignment Week 3\n\nProblem 8. Schwarzschild Metric.\nThis problem is based on equations (15) of the notes \"Gravity, Metrics, and Coordinates\".\n(a) Assuming that the pressure vanishes everywhere, solve equations (15) exactly. Your\nanswer for e -2Λ(r) may depend on the enclosed mass M(r) defined in equation (14) of\nthe notes.

      "content": "MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY\nPhysics 8.224 Exploring Black Holes\nGeneral Relativity and Astrophysics\nSpring 2003\nASSIGNMENT for WEEK 4\nINTRODUCTION\nChapter 2 of EBH presented the first Big Idea of the text: the metric that relates wristwatch\ntime between two events to the incremental change in coordinates between those two events.\nChapter 3 employs the second Big Idea: the Principle of Maximal Aging. Remember the twin\nparadox? The twin who relaxes at home ages more than the twin who streaks to a distant star\nand returns. Nature commands the free stone: Follow the path of maximal aging. In an inertial\nframe the path of maximal aging is a straight worldline. And it is true in general relativity.\nWhy? Because in general relativity you can always find a local inertial frame in which the\nfree stone is currently moving. And in that local inertial frame special relativity applies. So\nthe special relativity command \"Follow a straight worldline in an inertial frame.\" becomes\nthe general relativity command \"Follow a straight worldline in a local inertial frame.\" One big\njob of general relativity is to patch together local inertial frames to describe curved\nspacetime. In the patched-together spacetime of general relativity, the Principle of Maximal\nAging summarizes Nature's command to the stone.\nThis week we apply the two Big Ideas to predict the motion of a stone as it plunges radially\ntoward a black hole. The main result is a new expression for the total energy of the stone. We\nuse this expression for energy to predict the changing values of velocity of our plunging\nstone as measured in different reference frames. One striking prediction: The far-away\nbookkeeper concludes that the stone slows down as it approaches the horizon, coasting to rest\nat the horizon over an unlimited far-away time. In contrast, the plunging observer riding on\nthe stone zips through the horizon, streaks ever downward inside the horizon, and is tidally\nsqueezed and pulled into spaghetti near the crunch-point at the center of the black hole.\nWeird? Welcome to general relativity!\nThorne fills in the human and historical background of our tale: The almost irrational\nresistance of Einstein and others to the idea of a black hole; the prediction by a nineteen-year-\nPhysics 8.224 Spring 03\nAssignment Week 4\n\nold Indian Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar (for whom the current orbiting Chandra X-ray\nobservatory is named) that a white dwarf cannot sustain itself against the pull of gravity if its\nmass is greater than about 1.4 times the mass of our Sun; the public humiliation of\nChandrasekhar by the eminent astrophysicist Sir Arthur Eddington, resulting in\nChandrasekhar's retreat from the study of black holes for three decades, during which others\ntook up the task.\nREADINGS\nExploring Black Holes: Chapter 3, Plunging\nAND\nThorne: Chapter 3, Black Holes Discovered and Rejected\nAND\nThorne: Chapter 4, The Mystery of the White Dwarfs\nAND\nSections 1 and 2 of the handout \"How Gravitational Forces Arise from Curvature.\"\nOPTIONAL\nThe homework exercises refer to pages B-12 thru B-14 of Project B, Inside the Black Hole in\nEBH.

Start with a white dwarf that gradually steals matter from an orbiting companion.\nDescribe the sequence of structures that result, including the approximate radius and\nmass of each. Which of these structures were unknown to the young Chandrasekhar?\n2. What \"physical impossibilities\" did Einstein invoke to disprove the possible existence\nof a black hole? Were Einstein's predictions about these physical impossibilities\ncorrect? What was wrong with his arguments?\n3. An observer riding inside a freely-falling small capsule approaches the horizon of a\nspherical black hole of mass one million times the mass of our Sun.

(h) The\nplunger will NOT be able to see the crunch point ahead of her as she approaches it.\nPROBLEM SET\nDue before end of week #4.\nEXERCISE 1. PLUNGING FROM REST AT INFINITY\nThis is a modification of Exercise 1, page 3-28 of Exploring Black Holes.\nBlack hole Alpha has a mass M = 8 kilometers and a horizon radius of 2M = 16 kilometers. A\nstone starting from rest at a great distance falls radially into black hole Alpha. In the\nfollowing consider all speeds to be positive and express these speeds as a decimal fraction of\nthe speed of light.\nA What is the speed of the stone measured by the shell observer at r = 50 kilometers as\nthe stone passes the shell observer?\nB What is the bookkeeper speed of the stone as it passes r = 50 kilometers?\nC What is the speed of the stone measured by the shell observer at r = 30 kilometers as\nthe stone passes the shell observer?\nD What is the bookkeeper speed of the stone as it passes r = 30 kilometers?\nE In a two or three sentences, explain why the speed change in parts A and C reckoned\nby the bookkeeper as the stone moves inward is qualitatively different from the\nspeed change in parts B and D measured by shell observers at smaller radii.\nEXERCISE 2. ENERGY CONVERSION USING A BLACK HOLE\nThis is a modification of Exercise 6, page 3-29 of Exploring Black Holes.\nPLEASE READ that exercise before attempting this one.\nNOTE that a shell observer can use special relativity to compute the kinetic energy of a\nparticle of mass m that passes his shell with velocity that he measures to be vshell .\nBlack hole Beta has a mass M = 10 kilometers and a horizon at 2M = 20 kilometers. A bag of\ngarbage of mass m starts from rest at a power station that is a great distance from the black\nPhysics 8.224 Spring 03\nAssignment Week 4\n\nhole. This bag of garbage falls radially onto a shell of radius (reduced circumference) r = 30\nkilometers. This shell has a machine that converts all of the kinetic energy of the incoming\ngarbage into a light flash.\nA What is the energy, measured by the shell observer at r = 30 kilometers, of the\nphotons produced by this machine as a fraction of the rest energy m of the garbage?\nB The machine now directs the resulting flash of light radially outward. What is the\nenergy of this flash as it arrives back at the power station, energy expressed as a\nfraction of the original rest energy m of the garbage?\nC Now the garbage (which was brought to rest at r = 30 kilometers when its kinetic\nenergy was converted to photons) is released from the shell at radius r and falls into\nthe black hole. What is the increase in mass of the black hole, expressed as a fraction\nof the original rest energy m of the garbage?\nD What is the fractional efficiency of this energy converter, that is (energy output minus\nenergy input)/(energy input)?\nAdvice: Check your answers by looking for possible conservation relations among your\nnumerical results in this exercise.\nEXERCISE 3. HITTING A NEUTRON STAR\nThis exercise is a major revision of exercise 3, page 3-28 in Chapter 3 of Exploring Black Holes.\nA particular nonrotating neutron star has a mass M = 1.35 times the mass of Sun and a radius\nof 10 kilometers. A stone starting from rest at a great distance falls onto the surface of this\nneutron star. Express all speeds as decimal fractions of the speed of light, and consider all\nspeeds to be positive.\nA If this neutron star were a black hole with the same mass, what would be the\nr-value of its horizon in kilometers?\nB With what speed does the stone hit the surface of the neutron star as measured by\nsomeone standing on the surface?\nC With what speed does the stone hit the surface of the neutron star according to the\nfar-away bookkeeper?\nSeveral years ago, it was thought that astronomical gamma-ray bursts might be caused by\nstones (asteroids) impacting neutron stars. Carry out a preliminary analysis of this\nhypothesis by assuming that the stone is made of iron. The observer standing on the surface\nof the neutron star (as the shell observer, Section 6, page 3-17 of EBH) can use special\nrelativity to calculate the kinetic energy of impact. The impact kinetic energy is very much\ngreater than the binding energy of iron atoms in the stone, greater than the energy needed to\ncompletely remove all 26 electrons from each iron atom, and greater even than the energy\nneeded to shatter the iron nucleus into its component 26 protons and 30 neutrons. So we\nneglect all these binding energies in our estimate. The result is a vaporized gas of 26 electrons\nPhysics 8.224 Spring 03\nAssignment Week 4\n\nand 56 nucleons (protons and neutrons). We want to find the average energy of photons\n(gamma rays) emitted by this gas.\nD Explain in a few brief sentences why, just after impact, the electrons have very much\nless kinetic energy than the nucleons. So in what follows we neglect the initial kinetic\nenergy of the electron gas just after impact.\nE Very quickly the nucleons share their kinetic energy with the electrons. Assume that\nboth the proton and the neutron have the rest energy (mass) 1 GeV. Estimate the\ntemperature in MeV (= 2/3 times the average kinetic energy per particle in MeV) of\nthe electron-nucleon gas (\"plasma\").\nF The hot gas emits thermal radiation with characteristic photon energy approximately\nequal to the temperature. What is the characteristic energy of photons reaching a\ndistant observer, in MeV?\nNOTE: It is now known that astronomical gamma-ray bursts release much more energy than\nan asteroid falling onto a neutron star. Gamma ray bursts are now thought to arise from the\nbirth of black holes in distant galaxies.\nEXERCISE 4. THE PLUNGER\nAn observer falls from rest starting a great distance from a black hole. Call this observer the\nplunger. The plunger falls past two shells an incremental reduced circumference dr apart at\na radius r.\nA How far apart drshell are these two shells as measured by a shell observer?\nB The shell observer and the plunger can use special relativity to transform observed\ndistances and times between them. How far apart drplunge the shells are as\nmeasured by the plunger?\nC How long dtshell as measured by the shell observer does it take the plunger to fall\nbetween these two shells?\nD How long dtplunge as measured by the plunger does it take for the two shells to pass\nher?\nE What is the speed drplunge/dtplunge at which the plunger measures the shells to be\npassing her? Compare this speed with the speed drshell/dtshell of the passing\nplunger as measured by the shell observer. Account for the similarity of or difference\nbetween these two expressions for speed.\nEXERCSE 5. CAN THE BOOKKEEPER BE A REAL OBSERVER?\nNOTE ON UNITS: The supplementary notes by Bertschinger set c = 1 but carry the constant\nG along. G does not appear in the metrics in EBH, for reasons explained in Section 6 of\nPhysics 8.224 Spring 03\nAssignment Week 4\n\nx\nx\nChapter 2. To make things simple, just set G = 1 in Bertschinger's notes for purposes of\nsolving the exercises in this assignment.\nBertschinger's notes stress that bookkeeper coordinates, those that appear on the RIGHT side\nof the metric, can be entirely arbitrary, are often chosen for convenience of calculation, and\nneed not represent distances or times recorded by any observer. In contrast, distance and\ntime measured by an observer appear on the LEFT side of the metric: proper time dτ and\nproper distance ds (called dσ in EBH) between two nearby events.\nNevertheless, it is fair to ask for any set of bookkeeper coordinates: Is there an observer\nwhose clock reads bookkeeper time? The answer is \"sometimes.\" In this exercise you will\nanswer this question for two different cases: Schwarzschild time and rain time. In both cases\nuse the truncated metric for motion in a plane (θ = π/2).\nA. Schwarzschild bookkeeper time. Is there an observer whose clock reads Schwarzschild\nbookkeeper time? Answer this question by setting dτ = dt in the Schwarzschild metric. Is\nthere a location of a stationary clock (dr = dφ = 0) such that the resulting equation is valid?\nHow does this result square with the analysis of bookkeeper time in Chapter 2 of EBH?\nB. Bookkeeper rain time. (References: Section 5 of the second set of Notes, \"Gravity, Metrics\nand Coordinates\" and EBH pages B-12 to B-14) Is there an observer whose clock reads rain\ntime?

Is\nthere a radial velocity dr/dtrain such that the equation is valid? There is a velocity equation in\nChapter 3 that has the same form.

By this time we are accustomed to the\nsurprising predictions of the Schwarzschild metric, have learned to change coordinate systems\nthe way we change clothes, and easily use total energy as a constant of the motion to describe a\nstone plunging into a black hole. The topic for this week: Orbiting satellites. For orbits, there are\ntwo constants of the motion: (1) energy-measured-at-infinity, which is given by the same\nexpression as for radial plunge, and (2) angular momentum, which is the same expression as in\nNewtonian mechanics, except the Newtonian universal time increment dt is replaced by the\nproper time increment dτ, that is, the time read on the wristwatch of the orbiting stone.\nWhat is difficult about this chapter? For many people the greatest difficulty is manipulating\nangular momentum, whether Newtonian or relativistic. For both theories, the angular\nmomentum is just the radius to the particle multiplied by the particle's component of linear\nmomentum perpendicular to this radius. There is a different expression for linear momentum in\nthe two cases: mds/dt for Newton, mds/dτ for Einstein.\nPhysics 8.224, Spring 2003\nAssignment Week 5\n\nThe chapter on orbits ends by extending the idea of effective potential in Newtonian orbital\nmechanics to orbits in Schwarzschild spacetime. Why bother with effective potential? Because it\ngives an immediate qualitative view of the motion. From a graph derived from the energy and\nangular momentum of an unpowered spaceship, you can tell at a glance whether that spaceship\nand its crew will orbit the black hole, escape to infinite distance, or plunge through the horizon to\noblivion. The effective potential offers a qualitative description of the orbit before the computer\ndelivers a computer plot that may be wrong because of some misconception or programming\nerror. A software program GRorbits by Slavomir Tuleja animates the effective potential analysis\nof orbits and delivers both qualitative analysis and numerical results.\nA neutron star is the most compact stellar object short of a black hole. Once the neutron star was\nidentified, the question was inevitable: Is the formation of a black hole compulsory as more and\nmore mass is added to a neutron star? Thorne describes the engagement of this question by the\nBig Guns: Zwicky, Landau, Oppenheimer, and finally the co-author of our text, Wheeler. So is\nimplosion to a black hole compulsory? At the end of Thorne's Chapter 5, Oppenheimer says yes,\nbut at that time Wheeler remained unconvinced.\nREADINGS\nExploring Black Holes: Chapter 4, Orbiting\nAND\nThorne, Chapter 5. Implosion is Compulsory\nAND\nSections 3-5 of the notes \"How Gravitational Forces Arise from Curvature\"\nRECITATION\nThe recitation quiz will include at least one of the following questions.\n1. Why does the derivation for the energy of a radial plunger (EBH Chapter 3) lead to the same\nexpression as the derivation for the energy of an orbiter (EBH Chapter 3)?\n2. Given (a) a graph showing either the Newtonian or relativistic effective potential as a function\nof radius and (b) the energy of a particle on that graph, describe the orbit of the particle\nqualitatively. At what radii does the radial component of velocity increase or decrease? Will the\norbit be bounded? Where does the particle reverse radial motion? Can the particle end up at\ninfinity (and if so, at rest or in motion)? Will the particle plunge through the horizon?\n3. Compare and contrast (a) the physical arguments that led Chandrasekhar to conclude that a\nwhite dwarf has a maximum mass of about 1.4 solar mass and (b) the physical arguments that\nled Oppenheimer and Volkoff to conclude that a neutron star has a maximum mass of between\n0.5 and several times the solar mass.\n4. Wheeler and Wakano studied cold, dead objects. Why cold and dead rather than hot and evolving?\nPROJECT\nBy end of week #5 assignments will be made to project teams.\nPhysics 8.224, Spring 2003\nAssignment Week 5\n\nHOMEWORK EXERCISES\nEXERCISE 1. CIRCULAR ORBIT\nThis exercise asks you to use the results of derivations in the exercises of Chapter 4 of Exploring\nBHs to calculate some numerical results for the circular orbit of radius, r = 8M. Pay special\nattention to Exercises 2, 3, and 7 in the text. You are NOT asked to carry out the derivations in\nthese exercises, but please cite the equations you use. Give all speeds as fractions of the speed of\nlight.\nA What is the speed vbkkpr with which the Schwarzschild bookkeeper reckons the orbiter\nto be moving in circular orbit at r = 8M? What is the bookkeeper time for the completion\nof one orbit?\nB What is the speed of the stone vshell as measured by the shell observer at r = 8M ? What\nis the shell time for the completion of one orbit?\nC What is the speed vorbiter with which the orbiter at r = 8M measures the shell to be\nmoving past her? What is the orbiter wristwatch time for the completion of one orbit?\nD Time travel. What is the time stretch factor dτ/dt for an astronaut in this orbit from the\npoint of view of a far-away observer. What rocket speed in flat spacetime gives the same\ntime stretch value?\nEXERCISE 2. NEWTONIAN ORBITS AS A LIMITING CASE\nCarry out Exercise 4, page 4-30 of EBH.\nEXERCISE 3. SCHWARZSCHILD ORBITS WITH HIGH ANGULAR MOMENTUM\nMake qualitative analyses of orbits around a black hole for the case of large angular momentum\nusing the following outline. Simplify algebraic manipulations in this exercise by using\ndimensionless asterisked variables r*, L*, and V* introduced in Exercise 2, page 4-29 of EBH. Add\nE* = E/m to these definitions. You may use the results of any exercise in Chapter 4 without\nderivation, but cite the equations you use.\nA What is the form of equation [31] in dimensionless variables?\nIN THE FOLLOWING ASSUME THAT L*2 >> 1 but in the resulting approximations keep\nterms proportional to 1/L*2. HINT: See approximation inside back cover of EBH.\nB What is the minimum radius r*minV and the maximum radius r*maxV of a circular orbit\nat the minimum and maximum of the squared effective potential V*2\nC What are the values of V*2\nmin and V*2\nmax?\nPhysics 8.224, Spring 2003\nAssignment Week 5\n\nD For what value of E*2 will the orbit be circular and stable.\nE For what range of E*2 will the orbit be bound between two fixed values of r?\nF For what range of E*2 will the particle ALWAYS escape to infinity?\nG For what value of E*2 will the orbit be circular and unstable?\nEXERCISE 4. TIME TO THE CENTER FROM ANY INITIAL RADIUS.\nA An astronaut falls from rest at an initial radius ro outside the horizon. How long does it take\nher to reach the center as recorded on her wristwatch?\nB For ro = 8M, what is the numerical value of the wristwatch time to the center, expressed as a\nmultiple of M (meters). What is this wristwatch time in seconds for the black hole at the center of\nour galaxy, whose mass is approximately 2.6 million times the mass of Sun? Assume (incorrectly)\nthat this black hole is not spinning.\nEXERCISE 5. FALLING IN THE RAIN.\nThe Schwarzschild metric is only one possible representation of the spacetime of a non-spinning\nblack hole. Project B of EBH, and the supplementary notes Gravity, Metrics, and Coordinates,\npresent another form of the metric using rain coordinates.\nA Starting from equation (21) of Gravity, Metrics, and Coordinates (but setting G=1), use the Euler-\nLagrange equations of the notes How Gravitational Forces arise from Curvature to derive\nexpressions for E/m and L/m, the conserved energy at infinity and angular momentum per unit\nmass. (Hint: repeat the derivations of equations 21-26 of the latter notes.) Your results will differ\nslightly from equations (28) of the notes How Gravitational Forces arise from Curvature. Why?\nB Consider a radially falling test mass, for which L=0. Using the rain-frame metric - equation\n(21) of Gravity, Metrics, and Coordinates - and your result for E/m in part A, eliminate dr/dτ and\nshow that the rain-frame bookkeeper time and wristwatch time are related by a \"clock rate\"\ndt/dτ given by a solution of the following quadratic equation:\n\n1 - 2M\n\ndt\nd\n- 2\n\nE\n\ndt 2M + E 2\n\nr\nm d +\n\nr\nm 2\n= 0\nThe quadratic has two roots. Give the root corresponding to infall, dr/dτ < 0.\nC Using the results of this exercise, show that a body that falls from rest at an initial radius ro\noutside the horizon has\nE =\n1 - 2M\n\n1/ 2\nm\n\nro\nPhysics 8.224, Spring 2003\nAssignment Week 5\n\nUsing this and the result of part B, show that as the body crosses the horizon, dt/dτ remains\nfinite in rain coordinates. When viewed by a rain-frame bookkeeper, can a body ever cross the\nhorizon? How about when viewed by a Schwarzschild-frame bookkeeper?\nEXERCISES WITH GRorbits PROGRAM\nDownload the compressed Java Orbits program from the Materials section of the website and\nexpand the file. Click on the icon GRorbits.html. If that does not work, click on the icon\nGRorbitsConverted.html. PLAY AROUND with the various controls and Menu settings. Pay\nattention to Schwarzschild coordinates, rain coordinates, and Newtonian predictions.\nEXERCISE 6. FALLING FROM REST AT ro = 8M .\nA plunger falls from rest starting at ro = 8M . Use the orbits program to determine how long it\ntakes to reach the singularity. On whose clock is this time recorded? Compare the GRorbits result\nwith the prediction you derived in Exercise 4. HINT: You have to use rain coordinates, because\nthe plunger does not pass through the horizon as clocked by the Schwarzschild bookkeeper.\nEXERCISE 7. CIRCULAR ORBIT AT ro = 8M\nChoose a circular orbit with r = 8M (same as exercises 1). Compare the values of the periods of\nthis orbit for bookkeeper and wristwatch (orbiter) that you predicted in exercise 1 with that you\nobserve using the GRorbits program. HINT: Make liberal use of the \"Set stable circular orbit\"\ncommand under the INITIAL menu item.\nEXERCISE 8. ADVANCE OF THE PERIASTRON\nSelect ZOOM X100 from the menu at the top of the display. Find values of the parameters of a\nbounded orbit so that the periastron advances 20 degrees per orbit. (Perigee for orbit around\nEarth; perihelion for orbit around Sun, periastron for orbit around a star or a black hole.)\nIs it possible for you to find such parameters for orbits predicted by Newton?\nPhysics 8.224, Spring 2003\nAssignment Week 5"

Next a new set of metrics will inform your investigation of\nspinning black holes and a powerful model of the Universe. Finally, the projects will empower you\nand your team to apply accumulated insight and skill to an important topic of your choosing.\nThe key idea in Chapter 5 is the single effective potential for every light flash, no matter what its\nenergy--one size fits all! Moreover, there is no minimum in this effective potential, so there are no\nstable orbits for light flashes. There is, however, one unstable orbit, at r = 3M. Light can circulate\non a knife-edge orbit at this radius, on what is called the photon sphere. You will be able to visualize\nthese orbits using the JAVA GRorbits software provided by Slavomir Tuleja of the Slovak\nRepublic. Many thanks to him!\nThorne's Chapter 6 takes us into a long aside about the development of the hydrogen bomb by\nthe Soviets and the Americans. Work on nuclear weapons, both in the Soviet Union and the United\nStates, brought insight into the behavior of materials at extremely high pressures and informed\nthe developing theory of gravitational collapse. Wheeler was finally convinced that gravitational\ncollapse takes place under the right conditions. There remained (and remains to this day)\nperplexity about what happens at the crunch point, where classical general relativity cannot apply\nPhysics 8.224, Spring 2003\nAssignment Week 6\n\nsince the curvature increases without limit. We need quantum gravity. Wheeler speculated that at\nthe center matter might turn into radiation which could tunnel out through the horizon. (Hawking\nradiation is a faint echo of such tunneling.) In spite of his continuing reservations, Wheeler coined\nthe name black hole, which epitomizes the properties of this strange structure and has fueled its\npopularity.\nREADINGS\nExploring Black Holes: Chapter 5, Seeing\nAND\nThorne, Chapter 6: Implosion to what\nPROJECTS\nProject teams have been assigned, and each project has a forum on the discussion board..

You may\nadd topics to your forum and use them as a way to communicate if you wish (instead of or in\naddition to email, instant message, postal mail, or telephone). Remember that instructors and\nother class members can read discussion contributions but visitors to the website cannot.\nBy end of week #6\n1. Select a team leader and post his or her name in your project forum on the discussion board.\n2. Divide the project into subtopics and assign a term member or members to each subtopic,\nposting the results on your project forum on the discussion board.\nRECITATION\nAt least one of the following questions will appear on the recitation quiz.\n1. Starting from the Schwarzschild metric, derive expressions for bookkeeper speed of light\nmoving (a) radially, and (b) tangentially.\n2. For a light flash approaching a black hole but still at a great distance, the impact parameter b can\nbe defined as . . . .\n3. Compare the (incorrect) Newtonian picture of the trajectory a light flash emitted from the\nsurface of a star with radius inside its critical radius r = 2M (which can be stable according to\nNewton) to the general relativistic prediction about a light flash emitted in the radial outward\ndirection from a plunger falling inside the horizon.\n4. For a long time the so-called \"Schwarzschild singularity\" at r = 2M was thought to represent a\ndiscontinuity in the laws of physics. In 25 words or less, outline the new ideas that led to the\ncurrent understanding of the horizon.\nPhysics 8.224, Spring 2003\nAssignment Week 6\n\nPROBLEM SET\nPlaying around with the GRorbits program with the setting m = 0 under the Orbits menu can help\nyou develop an intuition for obits and trajectories of light around a center of gravitational\nattraction.\n1. ORBITS SOFTWARE: RIGHT ANGLE TURN FOR LIGHT\nSet the Zoom on X10, the initial radius at r = 200M. Find a value for 1/b such that the light makes a\n90 degree turn as it passes the black hole.\n2. ORBITS SOFTWARE: EINSTEIN RING\nSet the Zoom on X10, the initial radius at r = 192M (one of the graph circles). A light source is\nlocated at this point. Find the value for 1/b such that an observer at the opposite side of the black\nhole at r = 192M will observe an Einstein ring.\n3. ENERGY PRODUCTION BY A QUASAR?\nThis is a modification of Exercise 8, page 5-35 of Chapter 5. Please READ that exercise. But NOTE\nthat the questions below are different from those in the text. And the r-value of the circular orbit\nof one of the colliding stones is given a numerical value in the present exercise.\nFor you, the radius of the orbiting stone is r = 6M, the smallest radius for a stable orbit.\nUse special relativity and the results for circular orbits in the exercises of Chapter 4 to analyze the\ncircular orbit\nA As measured by the shell observer at r = 6M, what is the kinetic energy of the stone in its\nstable circular orbit at this same radius? Measure this kinetic energy as a fraction of the\nmass m of the stone. Two warnings: (1) Kinetic energy is NOT (1/2) mv 2 in special\nrelativity. (2) Kinetic energy is only part of total energy in special relativity.\nB As measured by the shell observer at r = 6M, what is the kinetic energy of the stone that\nfalls from rest at a great height? Measure this kinetic energy as a fraction of the mass m of\nthe stone.\nC Assume that the TOTAL kinetic energy, the sum of the quantities calculated in parts (A)\nand (B) is converted to a light flash with 100 percent efficiency and this light flash sent\noutward to a power station remote from the black hole. (Do not worry about\nconservation of momentum or other such details.) What is the energy of this flash as it\narrives at the remote power station? Express this energy as a fraction (or multiple) of the\nmass m of either original stone.\nD What fraction of the total rest energy m + m = 2m has been turned into light energy at\ninfinity? (Nuclear reactions on Earth convert less than one percent of the original mass\ninto energy.)\nE Suppose that each of the two colliding particles, each of mass m, is brought to rest at radius\nr = 6M after the flash has been emitted in the process described above.

The shell\nobserver measures this signal to have frequency fshell. What is the frequency ffar of this\nflash detected by the far-away observer when this light flash reaches her? Express your\nanswer as a multiple or decimal fraction of fshell.\nA2 A beacon falls radially into the black hole starting from rest at a great distance. This\nbeacon emits a series of flashes at a proper frequency fo as observed in its own frame. This\nbeacon passes the shell observer at radius r = 7M. Immediately after the beacon passes the\nshell observer, the shell observer looks inward and detects an outward-moving signal of\nfrequency fshell from the beacon. Using special relativity, find the value of that shell\nfrequency as a decimal fraction (or multiple) of the proper frequency fo emitted by the\nbeacon. (Note: In equation [50], page 5-36, the symbol vshell represents a positive\nquantity.)\nB Carry out the derivation indicated in part (B) of the exercise in the text and say whether or\nnot you succeeded in deriving equation [52], page 5-36 (honor system).\nC Find the radius r1 that the beacon is passing when it emits a signal whose frequency is\nobserved to be ffar = 0.9 fo when received by the distant observer.\nD Find the radius r2 the beacon is passing when it emits a signal whose frequency is\nobserved to be ffar = 0.1 fo when received by the distant observer.\nE Using the analysis in the text, find the far-away time, in meters, that it takes for the beacon\nto fall from r1 to r2 as defined in parts (C) and (D). Express your answer as a fraction or\nmultiple of M, the mass of the black hole.\nMORE: See next page\nPhysics 8.224, Spring 2003\nAssignment Week 6\n\nF Using the analysis in the text, find the far-away time required for the light from the beacon\nat r2 to rise to the higher radius r1 as a multiple of M, the mass of the black hole.

This study employs almost every skill developed\nduring this course, including manipulation of metrics, derivations of energy and angular\nmomentum, and different measures of time and space. These lead to predictions of some startling\nphysical effects:\n- spacetime swept around the spinning black hole\n- different speeds of light moving in different directions as measured by the bookkeeper\n- a plunging stone with zero angular momentum that nevertheless spirals inward\n- an ergosphere region outside the horizon in which nothing can stand still\n- the possibility that a stone inside the ergosphere can have negative energy-at-infinity\n- extraction of energy from a spinning black hole for use by a distant engineer\nThorne, in Chapter 7, describes the ten-year Golden Age of black hole studies between 1965 and\n1975, a time dominated by mentors of startlingly different styles: Wheeler, Zel'dovich, and Sciama.\nIndependent players included Roy Kerr, whose solution to the field equations for a spinning black\nhole we study this week, and Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, who came roaring back after almost\n40 years of mastering other fields to formulate a full mathematical description of black holes.\nREADINGS\nExploring Black Holes: Project F, The Spinning Black Hole\nThorne, Chapter 7, The Golden Age\nNOTE: Check the printing number of your copy of Exploring Black Holes by looking at the first\nnumber in the bottom line of the Acknowledgments page (back of the title page).

A spinning black hole has maximum possible angular momentum. A rocket ship attempts to\nmove radially inward, that is without circulating around the black hole. (a) Describe the direction\nand relative intensity of rocket blasts radially inward and tangential to this path required as the\nrocket descends at a constant radial speed. (b) How close to the black hole can the steady descent\nalong a radial line continue? (c) How close to the black hole is it possible for a rocket ship to keep a\nconstant radius, engines blasting, if it allows motion in a tangential direction?\n2. Compare and contrast the observations of a ring rider near a maximally spinning black hole\nwith the observations of a shell observer near a Schwarzschild black hole. These observations\ninclude results of local experiments and observation of the \"fixed\" stars overhead.\n3. A particle inside the static limit is moving so that it has negative energy-at-infinity, say -km,\nwhere k is a positive number and m is the particle mass. How much energy-at-infinity must be\nadded to the particle to move it to a very great distance from the black hole, with final kinetic\nenergy equal to m/2.\n4. Explain the meaning of the saying. \"A black hole has no hair.\" as it applies to the formation of a\nblack hole.\n5. A radio galaxy may have \"lobes\" hundreds of thousands of light years from the galaxy itself.\nWhat physical process leads to radio emission from these lobes?\nPROBLEM SET\nPROBLEM 1. Limiting values of R\nCarry out QUERY 6, page F-6\nPROBLEM 2. Deriving energy-at-infinity and angular momentum\nStarting from the Kerr metric in the equatorial plane, use the Euler-Lagrange equations of the\nnotes \"How Gravitational Forces Arise from Curvature\" to derive expressions for E/m and L/m,\nthe energy-at-infinity and angular momentum per unit mass. (Hint: repeat the derivations in\nequations 21-26 of the notes.) Determine whether E/m is conserved, and similarly for L/m. Show\nthat your results reduce to those for the Schwarzschild metric when the black hole spin a=0.\nPROBLEM 3. Bookkeeper speed in the \"final circle\"\nCarry out QUERY 18, page F-15\nPROBLEM 4.

Available energy from the monster black hole in our galaxy\nCarry out QUERY 31, page F-26\nPhysics 8.224, Spring 2003\nAssignment Week 7\n\nPROBLEM 6. Energies of a particle\nA particle inside the static limit at reduced circumference r = 1.5M is moving tangentially so that it\nhas negative energy-at-infinity -km, where k is a positive number and m is the particle mass. In the\nfollowing, rotating ring means a ring of zero angular momentum, as described in Section 9 of\nProject F. How much energy-at-infinity must be added to the particle to move it (a) to rest on a\nrotating ring at the same radius r = 1.5M. (b) to rest on a rotating ring at the static limit, (c) to a\nnon-rotating position at a radius r equal to twice that of the static limit, and (e) to a state of rest an\ninfinite distance away from the black hole?\nPROBLEM 7. Energy extracted in phase 1\nCarry out the following modification of QUERY 35, page F-30\nThe trouble with the analysis of pages F-28 and F-29 is that light emitted exactly at the horizon will\ntake forever to travel to a great distance, just as it would take forever for light to climb to a great\ndistance from the horizon of a non-rotating black hole. Therefore in the following assume that the\nmass and antimass are stopped on a freely-rotating ring at r = 1.5 M in Phase 1.\nWhen Phase 1 is completed, how much energy-at-infinity will have been milked off for use at the\ndistant location? Use equation [44] because it gives more accuracy than Figure 9. Express your\nanswer as a decimal fraction or multiple of the mass m. (Recall that a total mass 2m started\noriginally from a great distance.)\nPROBLEM 8. Energy extracted in phase 2\nCarry out the following modification of QUERY 36, page F-30.\nContinue with the NEW assumptions given in the revised QUERY 35, above. Just after Phase 2 is\ncompleted:\nA What is the energy of the flash moving FORWARD on the ring at r = 1.5 M as measured by\nthe ring observer? Express your answer in terms of the mass m.\nB What is the energy of the flash moving BACKWARD on the ring at r = 1.5 M as measured\nby the ring observer?

      "content": "MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY\nPhysics 8.224 Exploring Black Holes\nGeneral Relativity and Astrophysics\nSpring 2003\nASSIGNMENT Week 8\nINTRODUCTION\nModern cosmology began in 1917 with the publication by Einstein of the first mathematical model\nfor the universe as a whole based on general relativity. Einstein assumed that on large scales the\nuniverse is homogeneous and isotropic and static, unchanging in time. In order to make a static\nmodel, Einstein was forced to add a new term, called the cosmological constant, to his field\nequations. This term provided a uniform gravitational repulsion that balanced the gravitational\nattraction of ordinary matter.\nIn 1929, the astronomer Edwin Hubble showed that the universe is not static--the galaxies today\nare rushing apart as if expelled by a gigantic explosion which we now believe occurred 13.7 billion\nyears ago. However--and this is one of the most difficult concepts for beginning students--the\nexplosion took place everywhere, without a center. This explosion is called the Big Bang. After\nHubble's discovery, Einstein disavowed his cosmological constant.\nAfter Hubble's work, cosmology made few great advances until 1965, when a faint microwave\nglow filling the universe was discovered by the radio astronomers Penzias and Wilson. One of the\nbest popular science books ever written, The First Three Minutes by physicist Steven Weinberg\n(Basic Books, 1993, ISBN 0465024378), discusses the discovery of the cosmic microwave\nbackground radiation and its implications.\nCosmology entered a third golden era in the 1980s when particle physicists began contributing\nideas about the mysterious dark matter surrounding galaxies discovered by astronomers through\nits gravitational effect. Another important idea was contributed by particle physicist (now MIT\nprofessor) Alan Guth, who proposed that during the earliest moments of the Big Bang the\nuniverse was driven into a state of exponential or near-exponential expansion by an exotic\nsubstance called vacuum energy. Interestingly, vacuum energy behaves just like Einstein's\ndiscredited cosmological constant. Why did Guth's model inflate while Einstein's was static? Simply\nbecause Guth made the cosmological constant so large that its gravitational repulsion\nPhysics 8.224, Spring 2003\nAssignment Week 8\n\noverwhelmed the gravitational attraction of ordinary matter. However, Guth required that this\nrepulsive gravitational substance would quickly decay away, leaving the universe spatially flat (K\n= 0) and in a state of rapid expansion that, 13.7 billion years later, has slowed down to the leisurely\npace we see today.\nA fourth revolution in cosmology began in the mid-1990s, thanks to two crucial new observations.\nThe first made in 1998 through the optical light from distance supernova explosions, suggests that\nthe expansion of the universe is currently accelerating instead of decelerating as would be expected\ndue to the gravitational attraction of matter. Once again, vacuum energy can explain this by its\nrepulsive gravitational effect. Some astrophysicists still debate whether the interpretation of the\nsupernova results is correct, but the great majority of cosmologists agree that the weight of\nevidence from many different clues supports the conclusion that vacuum energy (or a generalized\nsubstance called dark energy) drives the universe into a new phase of accelerated expansion.\nThe second recent observation is the discovery and measurement of fluctuations in the cosmic\nmicrowave background radiation. The most recent measurements by the WMAP satellite indicates\nthat these fluctuations fit the predictions of Guth's cosmic inflation theory. They are the seed\nfluctuations that changed the homogeneous and isotropic universe into a richly textured cosmos\nfull of galaxies, stars, and planets.\nThese observations are so recent that few books have been written about them. Moreover,\nThorne's book excludes cosmology. Thus, in this last week of regular assignments, we provide an\nupdated Cosmology project that replaces Project G in EBH.\nIf you are interested in a very broad overview of modern cosmology ranging from black holes to\nthe big bang and other universes, you may read a popular article entitled \"Piecing Together the\nBiggest Puzzle of All\" written by distinguished astrophysicist Martin Rees for Science magazine,\nvolume 290 (2000), pages 1919-1925. The Rees article is available online at\nhttp://arXiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0103391 .

Radio signals often come from \"lobes\" that are far from the galaxy that is the source of the\nenergy which they emit. Describe a physical mechanism that might result in radio emission from\nthese lobes.\n3.

      "content": "MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY\nPhysics 8.224 Exploring Black Holes\nGeneral Relativity and Astrophysics\nSpring 2003\nASSIGNMENT: WEEKS 1 AND 2\nFor the ten days (week #1 and #2)\nINTRODUCTION\nThere are really only two Big Ideas in our text Exploring Black Holes (EBH). In the week #2\nwe study the first Big Idea: In the vicinity of a time-independent structure such as the\nEarth or a star, neutron star, or black hole, a time-independent equation called a metric\nrelates aging along a segment of worldline to particle displacement in space and time\ncoordinates along that segment.\nWhat does that mean? A free stone wearing a wristwatch moves from event A to nearby\nevent B. Between these two events the wristwatch on the stone records a time lapse dτ, where\nτ is called the proper time or wristwatch time. The wristwatch time measures the aging of the\nstone, or the aging of a puppy that rides on the stone. The metric tells us the amount of aging\nfor a given change in coordinates and time between events A and B. For flat spacetime, the\nmetric can be written:\n2 = t 2 - s 2\nwhere τ is the aging (proper time, wristwatch time), t is the increase in coordinate time and s\nis the distance between events A and B. Here space and time are measured in the same units,\nfor example years and light-years or meters and meters of light-travel time (EBH page 1-2).\nPhysics 8.224 Spring 03\nAssignment Weeks 1 and 2\n\nBookkeeper coordinates. A key feature of general relativity is that you can use any\ncoordinate system you want--it is entirely arbitrary. Typically you choose a coordinate\nsystem that simplifies your current project. But you are free to be as screwy as you can;\nNature does not care. For example, in flat spacetime we can define\nu = t - s\nand v = t + s\nA little weird? Sure, but giving the u and v of an event fixes uniquely its location in space and\ntime. In terms of the coordinates u and v, the metric for flat spacetime becomes:\n2 = u - v\nSuch an arbitrary set of coordinates we sometimes call bookkeeper coordinates.\nIn Chapter 2 of EBH we meet the famous Schwarzschild metric, which describes spacetime\nexternal to a spherically symmetric nonrotating center of gravitational attraction.\nd 2 =\n\n1- 2\nr\nM\n\ndt 2 - 1 -\ndr\nM - r 2 d 2\n\nr\nFeatures of this metric are detailed in Chapter 2 of EBH:\n1. As in flat spacetime, time and distance are measured in the same units. In\naddition, the mass M of the center of attraction is measured in units of distance\n(EBH page 2-13).\n2. For simplicity we assume that the two events occur in a plane through the center\nof attraction (EBH page 2-15).\n3. We use differentials because events A and B have to be close enough together so\nthat r has a unique value and because the Schwarzschild metric treats the arc rdφ\nas a straight segment, approximately true only if dφ is very small (EBH, box on\npage 2-18).\n4. Coordinates r and t are bookkeeper coordinates, defined to make the metric look\nsimple. The radius r is the circumference of a circle at that distance from the\ncenter divided by 2π (EBH page 2-7). The time t is the time read on clocks far\nfrom the center of attraction (EBH page 2-27).\nSo the metric is the first Big Idea in EBH. The second Big Idea is called the Principle of\nMaximal Aging, which uses the metric to determine how a free stone moves near a center of\ngravitational attraction. This is the subject of Chapter 3, to be assigned in the fourth week of\nthe class.\n1. RECITATION AND EVENING SEMINAR\nRecitation is scheduled once a week.\nPhysics 8.224 Spring 03\nAssignment Weeks 1 and 2\n\nAttendance are citations is required of students. Alums are welcome.\nThe first scheduled evening seminar is on the first day of week #2.\nSpeakers at the evening seminar are experts in fields covered in the class. The first speaker\nwill be announced later. Attendance at seminars is required for students.\n2. TEXTS\nThe two texts for this class are:\n1. Exploring Black Holes: Introduction to General Relativity by Edwin F. Taylor and John\nArchibald Wheeler, Addison Wesley Longman, 2000, ISBN 0-201-38423-X. Called \"EBH\" in\nall assignments. NOTE: You should have the fifth printing; the first number in the very\nbottom line of the Acknowledgments page (behind the title page) should be a 5.\n2. Black Holes and Time Warps: Einstein's Outrageous Legacy by Kip Thorne, W.W. Norton, 1994,\nISBN 0393312763. Called \"Thorne\" in all assignments.\n3. Homework at the end of week #1\nREAD Thorne Prologue: A Voyage among the Holes\nBEGIN research on one possible end-of-term project (details below)\n4. Homework at the end of week #2\nREAD EBH Chapter 1 Speeding\nAND EBH Chapter 2 Curving through page 2-24.\nREAD Thorne Chapter 1 The Relativity of Space and Time\nREAD HANDOUT \"Coordinates and Proper Time\" by Edmund Bertschinger, a pdf file\navailable on the Assignments page of Stellar.\nPROJECT SUMMARY: By end of week #2 submit by email a summary of one\npossible end-of-term project (details below).\n5. PREVIEWING END-OF-TERM PROJECTS\nThe end-of-term project will occupy approximately the last third of the semester. Each project\nwill be carried out by a small group consisting of both MIT students and alums. The\ndeliverables will be (a) a public web page, and (b) a half-hour presentation to the class. The\naudience will be the class supplemented with experts in the field. Leading up to the class\npresentations will be a series of deadlines for preliminary outlines and so forth.\nIn this first assignment you are asked to use the library, books, journals, and the world wide\nweb to research one possible end-of-term project that interests you and to prepare one or two\npages summarizing the physics behind the project. We prefer that the report not contain\nequations, but you may include brief references and links to interesting websites. Of course\nPhysics 8.224 Spring 03\nAssignment Weeks 1 and 2\n\nyour summary will not include technical details of general relativity that you will be learning\nduring the coming semester. Instead it should be a qualitative introduction to the topic,\nunderstandable by others who are beginning this class. Some details:\nA. Submit your summary as an attachment to an email to the instructor\nin any standard electronic form: Word, a pdf file, LaTeX, and so\nforth. Or you may send him a link to a web page of your own design. Your name\nshould be on your summary.\nB. Your completed summary (or link) will be posted as a contribution to a special\ndiscussion forum called Project Previews. The discussion forums can be read by class\nmembers and staff but not by anyone else. (In contrast, your web page for the end-of-\nterm final project will be posted on the public portion of the class website.)\nC. You will receive credit for submitting your summary, but the summary itself will not\nbe graded.\nD. Doubtless some topics will be summarized by more than one person. That is OK.\nE. You will NOT be obligated to work on the end-of-term project that you summarize in\nthis homework. Later you will be invited to express a preference for the project you\nwant to work on at the end of term.\n6. POSSIBLE END-OF-TERM PROJECTS\nHere is an annotated list of possible end-of-term projects. Some of them contain references to\nEBH and Thorne, but those treatments can be only starting points for your summary and for\nthe final project.\nYou are encouraged to think of an alternative topic for a project and summarize the physics\nof that topic instead of one on the list below. There are no limits to these alternative topics in\nthis assignment, but any topic not on the list below will have to be approved by instructor\nbefore you work on it as an end-of-semester project. Any alternative project,indeed\nany project on the following list, will ultimately need to attract enough class members\nto form a team.\nThe Search for Black Holes (Thorne Chapter 8, which is by now out of date)\nWhat evidence do astronomers have that black holes exist? How did they form?\nWhat effect do they have on their environment? How common are they? If they're\nblack, how can we see them? Half of the 2002 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded for\nwork that is helping to answer these questions.\nThe Spinning Black Hole (EBH Project F, Thorne Chapter 7)\nHow does the spin of a black hole affect the spacetime around it? How does it affect\norbits of photons or massive particles? Can the spin energy be tapped? Can spinning\nblack holes be used for travel to other universes? The mathematics of spinning black\nholes is wicked hard but they are wicked good fun!\nPhysics 8.224 Spring 03\nAssignment Weeks 1 and 2\n\nCosmological Models (EBH Project G)\nHow does the composition of the universe affect its overall evolution and its spatial\ngeometry? Will the universe recollapse or will it expand forever? How can the cosmic\nmicrowave background radiation help answer these questions? MIT Professor Alan\nGuth, who has agreed to be one of our seminar speakers, invented the leading theory\nof the early universe!\nGlobal Positioning System (EBH Project A)\nHow does the satellite navigation system depend on understanding general relativity?\nHow are GPS signals encoded to allow precise triangulation? How accurate can GPS\nbe made? How much of our technology relies on GPS? Could GPS ever be used to\nmeasure effects besides the gravitational redshift and Doppler effect?\nInside the Horizon of the Black Hole (EBH Project B, Thorne Chapter 13)\nIf you fall into a black hole and shine a flash light outwards, which reaches the\nsingularity first--you or the light? Since the Schwarzschild bookkeeper coordinates\ngo crazy inside the horizon, are there coordinates that are well-behaved across the\nhorizon? What is the singularity really like?\nAdvance of Perihelion of Mercury (EBH Project C, Thorne Chapter 2)\nKepler said that orbits around the sun are closed ellipses; Einstein proved him wrong.\nHow much does the direction of perihelion change each orbit? How does this depend\non the orbital eccentricity? What happens to the precession rate if the orbit around a\nblack hole is made nearly as small as possible, i.e. a slight elongation of the innermost\nstable circular orbit?\nLight Slowed Near Sun (EBH Project E, )\nThe Viking spacecraft not only sampled the soil of Mars; they also measured the speed\nof light in the solar system. What did they find? Why was this measurement called by\nits inventor \"The Fourth Test of General Relativity\"? How is this related to time\ndelays in gravitational lenses?\nEinstein Rings (EBH Project D, Thorne?)\nWhy did Einstein say that the image of a star could be a ring instead of a point? Why\ndid he say, incorrectly, that the effect would never be seen? What are gravitational\nlenses and microlenses and what have they taught us about dark matter, galaxies, and\nthe universe?\nGravitational Radiation (Thorne Chapter 7)\nNewtonian gravity assumes action at a distance, in clear violation of the principle of\nrelativity. How does general relativity fix this? Why and how do gravitational waves\nstretch space and what does that mean? How are they produced and how are LIGO\nand other instruments preparing to detect them?\nTaylor-Hulse Binary\nWhy did Taylor and Hulse win the Nobel Prize? How did they measure the masses of\ntwo neutron stars to better than 1% accuracy? Why is the orbit of their two stars\nshrinking, how fast is it shrinking, and what will happen when it shrinks to the size of\nBoston? How did the stars get in this predicament?\nPhysics 8.224 Spring 03\nAssignment Weeks 1 and 2\n\nGamma Ray Bursters\nHow can an exploding star, for a few seconds, appear to emit nearly as much energy\nas all the other stars in the universe combined? What do we know about these bizarre\nexplosions, and how is MIT's HETE satellite helping us to unravel their nature? What\ndo gamma ray bursters have to do with black holes?\nSupermassive Black Holes\nWhat do we know about the masses of real black holes and how do we know it? What\nare quasars and active galactic nuclei? Does our galaxy have a central supermassive\nblack hole, and are we in danger of falling in? What's the largest black hole known in\nthe Universe and how did it form?\nHawking Radiation (Thorne Chapter 12, EBH boxes on pages 2-4 and 5-27)\nWhat are the laws of black hole thermodynamics? How do they suggest that black\nholes may not be black, and that by emitting radiation an isolated black hole could\nevaporate? What is the temperature of the blackbody radiation emitted by a black\nhole? How long do black holes live before they evaporate?\nPhysics 8.224 Spring 03\nAssignment Weeks 1 and 2"

By chance, this tennis\nball passes close to the stationary rocket ship.

The following statements describe the motion of a light flash near a NON-spinning\nblack hole, but outside the horizon (unless otherwise noted).\nA. The bookkeeper speed of light is not measured directly by any local observer\nclose to the black hole.\nB. The shell observer measures the speed of light to be unity (in meters per meter).\nC. The deflection of a light flash depends upon its energy. For given initial\nlocation and direction, a gamma ray flash will be deflected differently than a\nflash of visible light.\nD. Question: Why does a flash of light that passes our sun take longer to traverse\nits path to a distant observer than the same flash in the absence of the sun?\nAnswer: Because the light path is deflected and therefore has a sufficiently\nlonger path to account for the longer transit time.\nE. Light can follow a stable circular orbit around a non-spinning black hole.\nF. An observer falling toward the center inside the horizon cannot see the crunch\npoint ahead of her.\nPhysics 8.224\nMidterm Examination\n\n3.

The gravitational deflection of the trajectories of radio waves between orbiting\nsatellite and earth-surface receiver has a significant effect on the operation of\nthe GPS.\nB. The orbits of the satellites can be calculated sufficiently accurately using\nNewtonian mechanics for the purpose of operating the GPS.\nC. The receiver on earth's surface requires signals from TWO GPS satellites in\norder to locate its position.\nD. The satellite clock rates are significantly affected by both the relative speed of\nsatellite and receiver and the difference in radii between satellite and receiver.\nE. It would be possible in principle to design and install a GPS with the satellites\nparked in \"stationary\" orbits around the equator, each satellite permanently\nabove a fixed point on earth's surface.

All clocks etc are outside the horizon.\nA. All shell clocks on a given spherical shell can be synchronized with one another\nand will remain synchronized.\nB. A clock very far from the black hole can display bookkeeper time directly.\nC. In general, whatever the metric, bookkeeper coordinates of an event do not\nnecessarily refer by themselves to physical measurements with rods and\nclocks.\nD. A shell observer and an observer passing the shell in free-fall can compare their\nlocal coordinate values of nearby events using the Lorentz transformation of\nspecial relativity.\nE. A shell clock \"runs slow\" compared with a far-away clock.

At least one question on the exam will be similar to a problem from one of the problem sets.\n2. At least one question will concern reading in Kip Thorne's book.\nThe Thorne question will be taken from the list of questions on the following page.\n3. At least one question will concern the content of an evening seminar.\n4. The test will be CLOSED BOOK; no printed materials are allowed. You may bring ONE 8.5 by\n11 inch sheet of paper on which you may write whatever notes you wish, using both sides of the\npaper. The notes must be handwritten (no microfiches!). Put your name on this sheet of notes;\nyou will turn it in at the end of the examination.\n5. You will be provided with a photocopy of the Selected Formulas that face the inside back cover\nof the text Exploring BHs. You will be given any physical constants needed to complete the\nexamination, such as the speed of light or the radius of Earth. You may request that the Kerr\nmetric be written on the board.\n6. You may NOT use ANY electronic device whatsoever during the examination. This prohibition\nincludes ALL electronic devices, such as hand calculators, Palm Pilots and similar instruments,\ncalculating watches, cell phones, and laptop computers. You are allowed to glance occasionally at\nyour conventional wristwatch, whether it is electronic or mechanical.\nDuring the week before the midterm examination the instructors will monitor the Midterm\nExam Help forum on the Discussion page of the class website . This is the preferred channel for\nanswering questions about the material and the examination.\nYou may also request a personal session with an instructor.\n[THORNE questions on the following page.]\nPhysics 8.224\nMidterm exam preview\n\nTHORNE QUESTIONS\nOne of the following question will appear on the exam.\nUSING 3 TO 7 SENTENCES, ANSWER THE FOLLOWING QUESTION FROM YOUR READING\nIN THORNE:\n1. Why does our Sun not collapse into a black hole? Why does a white dwarf not collapse into a\nblack hole? Why does a neutron star not collapse into a black hole?\n2. Explain why the gravitational effect of the moon on Earth's oceans tends to create a peak in the\nocean level on the side of Earth OPPOSITE to that of the moon.\n3. Case A: A star of perfect spherical symmetry collapses smoothly to form a Schwarzschild black\nhole. Case B: A ragged, asymmetrical collection of astronomical objects collapses to form a\nSchwarzschild black hole. Describe the differences in observations recorded by a remote\nobserver in the two cases.\n4. Describe one method for detecting the existence of black holes. (Seven sentences max!)\n6. Use Newtonian mechanics to describe and explain the tidal forces experienced by an astronaut\nwho falls freely, feet first, toward a non-rotating black hole.\n7. Start with a white dwarf that gradually steals matter from an orbiting companion. Assume no\nmatter is blown away from the accreting structure. Describe the sequence of structures that\nresult, including the approximate radius and mass of each. Which of these structures were\nunknown to the young Chandrasekhar on his way by boat to Great Britain?\n8. Wheeler and Wakano studied cold, dead objects. Why cold and dead rather than hot and evolving?\n9. Explain the meaning of the saying. \"A black hole has no hair.\" as it applies to the formation of a\nblack hole.\n10. A radio galaxy may have \"lobes\" hundreds of thousands of light years from the galaxy itself.\nWhat physical process leads to radio emission from these lobes?\nPhysics 8.224\nMidterm exam preview"
