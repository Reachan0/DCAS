Topics will include diatonic harmony, simple counterpoint in two parts, and tones of figuration. The coursework will combine composition, listening, analysis, and work in sight-singing and keyboard musicianship.\n\nRequired Texts for Lecture\n\nAldwell, Edward, and Carl Schachter.\nHarmony and Voice Leading\n. 3rd ed. Orlando, FL: Harcourt Brace, 2002. ISBN: 9780155062429.\n\nMusic manuscript paper: Please obtain a plentiful supply of music manuscript paper. (See the \"Music manuscript paper\" list of requirements for appropriate manuscript paper, located in the\nstudy materials\nsection.)\n\nRequired* Sight-singing Lab\n\nVocal models underlie virtually all the contrapuntal bases of our classical music (yes, even in purely instrumental idioms); hence, practice in singing classical music is one of the most efficient ways for you to internalize the classical norms of voice-leading. The lab meets for an hour at the end of each week, beginning after lecture 4. Bring the required text: Various Composers.\nFive Centuries of Choral Music for Mixed Voices.\nVol. 1. New York, NY: G. Schirmer, 1963.\n\n*Current members of the MIT Concert Choir or MIT Chamber Chorus are exempt from this requirement.\n\nRequired Piano Lab\n\nEven in our modern age of computer-assisted sound manipulation, the traditional musical keyboard still provides the most efficient way for an individual to perform or improvise contrapuntal polyphony in real time, and thus receive instantaneous aural feedback.\n\nPiano lab consists of a weekly session with a private piano instructor, doing keyboard exercises tied to this class but based on your individual skills. You're requested to work in the lab for one hour each week, during which the instructor will work with you for 15 minutes. Once you've negotiated a piano lab time, please be sure to attend regularly. If you won't be able to attend a session, please notify the instructor as far in advance as possible.\n\nDaily Assignments\n\nExpect to complete one assignment for each class meeting. Each late submission is penalized one letter grade for each calendar day it is late; no assignment will be accepted more than three days late. If you must miss a class meeting, leave your work at my office door by 9:00 a.m. the day it is due, or have a friend bring it to class.\n\nQuizzes\n\nDuring nearly every week, I will give a timed quiz (typically of five minutes' duration). These quizzes will measure your mastery of the most basic vocabulary (scales, intervals, triads) as well as some of the more important syntactic concepts of harmony and voice-leading.\n\nMidterm Exam\n\nThe midterm exam will cover material from Aldwell and Schachter (chapters 1-10 only), as well as material distributed in class.\n\nFinal Project\n\nToward the end of the semester, you will compose a melody that you will harmonize in classical style, creating a four-voice texture that adheres strictly to the principles of eighteenth-century harmony and voice-leading.\n\nFor the most part, the grading of homework assignments and the final harmonization project is strictly objective. At my discretion, I may occasionally award a bonus of two to five points for compositional artistry in the final project and in some of the homework assignments.\n\nSubject Requirements and Grade Weights\n\nACTIVITIES\n\nPERCENTAGES\n\nSight-singing Lab (incl. Handel Bass)\n\n10%\n\nPiano Lab (incl. Bach Reduction)\n\n10%\n\nDaily Preparation and Participation\n\n10%\n\nDaily Assignments\n\n20%\n\nWeekly Quizzes\n\n15%\n\nMidterm Exam\n\n15%\n\nFinal Project\n\n20%\n\nA failure to complete any one of these components will result in failure as your semester grade. That is, to pass this subject, you must attend the sight-singing and piano labs, and satisfactorily perform the Bach reduction and the Handel bass line for me. The labs are graded by their respective instructors; I will grade all other components.",

For visual clarity, I've omitted\nphrasing marks, and in the bass staff, rhythmic iterations of a given note within the same\nharmony are summarized as a sustained note.\n\nIn the first excerpt, 17 notes that don't fit the underlying triads have been removed from the\ntreble staff. Likewise, in the second excerpt, 25 such notes have been removed (mostly from the\ntreble staff, with two from the bass staff).\n\nFIRST EXCERPT (mm. 1-9)\n\n1. Below the bass staff, identify the key, and label the harmonies with the appropriate Roman\nnumerals and bass figures.\n\n2. In the right hand only, restore the 17 missing notes (i.e., the non-triadic tones).\n\n3. In the table attached, specify how each restored note is approached and departed within its\nrespective voice. In columns two and three, you needn't specify interval quality; instead, you\nmay simply specify \"downward step,\" \"upward leap,\" \"unison\" (or \"tie,\" even if the note isn't\nliterally tied), etc.\n\n4. Given these five dimensions of description, there are dozens of possible combinations of\nvalues (e.g., \"approached by STEP, departed by STEP in the SAME direction to a DIFFERENT\nchord tone in rhythmically WEAK position\").\n\nHow many combinations are actually represented among the 17 restored notes? Which\ncombinations appear more frequently than the others?\n\nSECOND EXCERPT (mm. 26-33)\n\n5. As above, analyze the harmony, restore the 25 missing notes, and specify the mechanical\nmeans by which the non-triadic tones are controlled.\n\n6.

      "content": "21M.301--Harmony and Counterpoint I\nBackground: Simple ratios of frequencies\n\nWithin the range of human hearing, there exist infinitely many possible standing waves,\nyet in our musical practice we restrict ourselves to a limited repertoire of pitches. The\nselection is based on our brains' preference for simple frequency relationships,\nexpressible as ratios of small integers (e.g., 1/1, 2/1, 3/2).\n\nWorking with these ratios is awkward for newcomers, because we're accustomed to\nthinking of musical tones in arithmetic rather than geometric terms. So we're prone to\nthink \"a major third plus a minor third plus a perfect fourth equals an octave,\" rather than\n\"5/4 times 6/5 times 4/3 equals 2/1,\" even though the latter description more directly\ndescribes the relationships among frequencies (and makes much better mathematical\nsense than \"3 + 3 + 4 = 8\"). This problem becomes especially acute when we \"subtract\"\nintervals, that is to say, divide ratios: compare \"a perfect fifth minus a perfect fourth\nequals a major second,\" vs. \"3/2 divided by 4/3 equals 9/8.\"\n\nConverting ratios to distances\n\nAs the above examples illustrate, it will be useful to convert each geometric ratio into an\nequivalent arithmetic distance, the better to visualize the comparative sizes of intervals.\nLet c stand for one arithmetic unit, such that a sum of 1200 units1 is equivalent to the\nidentity ratio of 2/1.\n\n1)\nc1200 = 2\n(i.e., the arithmetic unit c corresponds to the ratio 1.00057779/1)\n\nIn logarithmic terms,\n\n2)\n1200 log c =log 2\n\nTo convert the ratio 3/2, we need to find x such that\n\n3)\ncx = 3/2.\n\nSo taking logarithms as in lines 1 and 2 above,\n\n4)\nx log c = log (3/2)\n\nand if we then divide this expression by the expression in line 2, we get:\n\n5)\nx /1200 = log (3/2) / log 2\n\n[continued on reverse]\n\n1 Why 1200? The answer will reveal itself. The use of the letter \"c\" for our arithmetic unit provides a clue.\n\n21M.301--Harmony and Counterpoint I\n5)\nx /1200 = log (3/2) / log 2\n\nwhich we then manipulate to isolate the unknown x:\n\n6)\nx = 1200 log (3/2) / log 2 = 1200 (.176) / .301 = 701.955\n\n[if desired, each log above can be replace by ln: 1200 ln (3/2)/ln 2 = 1200 (.405) / .693 = 701.955 ]\n\nFrom line 6, we abstract the general formula:\n\nvalue in c = 1200 log(ratio)/log 2\n\n[or: c = 1200 ln(ratio)/ln 2]\n\nAssignment no. 1: SCALE CONSTRUCTION\n\nAttached is a graph showing the arithmetic distances among frequencies related by the\nratios 1/1, 2/1, and 3/2.\n\n1) Convert the following simple-integer ratios, and add them to the graph.\n\n4/3\n5/4\n6/5\n8/5\n5/3\n\nLabel each frequency with both its ratio and its c value, to one decimal place (e.g., it\nwill suffice to label 3/2 as 702.0c). Make sure that each ratio falls between 1/1 and 2/1; if\na ratio doesn't fit that range, multiply or divide the denominator by two (or four, or eight)\nto obtain an appropriate ratio.\n(e.g. 27/8 > 2/1, so we would multiply the denominator by two to get 27/16)\n\n2a) What's the interval between 3/2 and 4/3?\n2b) What's 3/2 of 3/2?\n2c) What's 3/2 of that?\n2d) What's 3/2 of that?\nAdd the above ratios to your graph.\n2e) How many recursive applications of 3/2 will get you back to 1/1 (or 2/1, 4/1, etc.)?\n\n(Supply your answer in the blank provided below the graph.)\n\n3a) What value falls 6/5 below 4/3? Add the resulting ratio to your graph.\n3b) What's the difference between that value and 9/8?\n(Supply your answer in the blank provided below the graph.)\n\n4a) How would you characterize the spacing of the values you've mapped?\n4b) How does this correspond to your previous knowledge (whether formal or intuitive)\nof scales and intervals?\n4c) What ratios would you propose to fill in the gaps? Add them to your graph.\n\n5) Be prepared to discuss in our next class meeting: What are the properties of the\nscale you've created? How many unique distances exist among its components? What\nproblems do your proposed interpolations solve or diminish? What problems do they\ncreate or magnify?"

      "content": "21M.301--Harmony and counterpoint I\n\nFINAL PROJECT: Performing forces\n\nIn preparing the final version of your score, you need to decide on the medium for which you are\nwriting, and refine your work accordingly (i.e., it will not suffice to write generic counterpoint).\n\nPlease be sure to LABEL your final score with your chosen performing forces.\n\n1. If you write for SATB choir, keep in mind that we, the class, are NOT highly trained singers.\nTherefore, the more conservatively you treat the voices with respect to range, the better the\nperformance you'll get. I recommend that you adhere to the following ranges:\n\nSoprano: (just below the treble staff) to D5 (fourth-line D)\n\nAlto: A3 (two ledger lines below the treble staff) to A4 (second-space A)\n\nTenor: D3 (bass staff, third-line D) to D4 (atop one ledger line above the staff)\n\nBass: A2 (first-space A) to A3 (fifth-line A)\n\nIf you alter your parts to fit these ranges, make sure that you don't create intervals larger than an\noctave between adjacent upper voices.\n\nAdvantages: SATB offers a broader palette of chord voicings and decorations within each part.\nDisadvantages: More possibilities may mean more opportunities to commit errors.\n\n2. If you write for piano solo, take particular care that the notes in either hand at any given\ninstant always fall within the interval of an octave. Keyboard writing offers more flexibility with\nregard to the number of voices, but be sure that you change on a phrase-by-phrase basis.\nYou can also achieve greater variety by doubling one of the outer voices at the octave; if\nyou do so, make sure that all the other voices are in the other hand, and that they always fit\nwithin an octave.\nTrills, turns, and other such figuration are most practical to perform when the other hand\nplays all the other voices. At most, the hand performing the ornament may take one other voice,\nand that added voice ought to represent a sustained tone.\n\nAdvantages: Small voice overlaps are allowed, and the leading tone may skip downward\nDisadvantages: Keyboard writing limits the number of practical chord voicings and decorations.\n\n3. If you write for melody instrument, accompanied by piano: You already know the strengths\nand limitations of your own instrument. In composing the piano part, follow the rules given\nabove for solo piano writing.\n\nAdvantages: Allows (and even encourages) more extensive decoration of the melody line, especially in\nlight of the greater range of most instruments compared to the range of most human voices.\nDisadvantages: Accompaniment is constrained as described above."

      "content": "21M.301--Harmony and counterpoint\n\nFinal project instructions\n\nFor your final project, you'll compose a short piece (ca. 32 bars) in classical style, conforming to\nthe principles of harmony and voice-leading as presented this semester. In particular, the piece\nwill make good use of harmonies other than the tonic and dominant, and will incorporate at least\nfour applied chords outside your cadence in another key (see below).\n\n1. FORM\n\nYour piece will take a rounded binary form, comprising two halves of roughly equal length,\nseparated by a repeat barline. A typical piece will comprise four four-bar phrases, making eight\nbars in each half, for a total of 16 bars. These four phrases will conform to the following scheme\nof harmonies and cadences:\n\nPhrase 1\nPhrase 2\nPhrase 3\nPhrase 4\n\nstarts in the home key;\nends with a HC\nin the home key\n\nstarts in the home key;\nends with a PAC\nin the OTHER key\n\nstarts in the OTHER key;\nends with a HC\nin the home key\n\nstarts in the home key;\nends with a PAC\nin the home key\n\nIf you choose a major key as your home key, then the other key will be that of the dominant (V).\nIf you choose a minor key as your home key, then the other key will be that of the mediant (III).\n\nNote that each half constitutes a period. You may use any type of period you wish for either half\n(see below).\n\nThe following represents the simplest, path-of-least-resistance form:\n\nsymmetric parallel period\nsymmetric contrasting period\nPhrase 1\nPhrase 2\nPhrase 3\nPhrase 4\na\na'\nb\na\"\n4 bars\n4 bars\n4 bars\n4 bars\n\nstarts in the home key;\nends with a HC\nin the home key\n\nstarts in the home key;\nends with a PAC\nin the OTHER key\n\nstarts in the OTHER key;\nends with a HC\nin the home key\n\nstarts in the home key;\nends with a PAC\nin the home key\n\nNote that this form allows you to reduce, reuse, and recycle your efforts, as it incorporates three\nversions of your opening phrase.\n\nVARIANTS\nIf you'd like to pursue a more varied form, you may...\n\n...compose either half as an asymmetric period, i.e. with two phrases of differing length\n\n...compose the first half as a symmetric contrasting period:\n\nsymmetric contrasting period\nsymmetric contrasting period\nPhrase 1\nPhrase 2\nPhrase 3\nPhrase 4\na\nb\nc\na'\n4 bars\n4 bars\n4 bars\n4 bars\n\nstarts in the home key;\nends with a HC\nin the home key\n\nstarts in the home key;\nends with a PAC\nin the OTHER key\n\nstarts in the OTHER key;\nends with a HC\nin the home key\n\nstarts in the home key;\nends with a PAC\nin the home key\n\n...compose the fourth phrase to end with a deceptive cadence in the home key, followed by a\nfifth phrase that provides the deferred perfect authentic cadence:\n\nsymmetric parallel period\nsymmetric contrasting three-phrase period\nPhrase 1\nPhrase 2\nPhrase 3\nPhrase 4\nPhrase 5\na\na'\nb\na\"\na'''\n4 bars\n4 bars\n4 bars\n4 bars\n4 bars\nHC\nPAC\nHC\nDC\nPAC\nhome key\nhomepOTHER\nOTHERphome\nhome key\n\n...compose the first half as a double period, so that the piece comprises eight (two-bar) phrases:\n\nsymmetric parallel double period\nsymmetric contrasting phrase group\ninconclusive period\nconclusive period\nphrase group\nconclusive period\nPhr.1\nPhr.2\nPhr.3\nPhr.4\nPhr.5\nPhr.6\nPhr.7\nPhr.8\na\nb\na'\nb'\nc\nc'\na\nb\"\n2 bars\n2 bars\n2 bars\n2 bars\n2 bars\n2 bars\n2 bars\n2 bars\nHC\nIAC\nHC\nPAC\nHC\nHC\nHC\nPAC\nhome key\nOTHER key\nOTHERphome\nhome key\n\n2. MEDIUM\n\nYou may write for any of the following:\n\na) SATB choir (with or without instrumental reinforcement)\n\nb) piano solo\n\nc) melody instrument, accompanied by piano\n\nIf you choose option (c), you are responsible to perform your melody (and thus to bring your\ninstrument to class on Wed 10 Dec).\n\n3. FORMAT\n\na) If you write for SATB choir, you need to submit only one copy of your score. You\nmay place the voices on two staves, as we've done all semester in four-part vocal writing.\nBe sure to leave at least one blank staff between notated systems, to allow room for\nanalytic notations (see below).\n\nb) If you write for piano solo, you need to submit two copies of your score (one for me,\nand one for the pianist who will perform it).\n\nc) If you write for melody instrument, you need to submit two copies (one for me, and\none for the pianist who will accompany you), and retain a third copy for your own use in\nperformance.\n\nPlease write with excruciating attention to neatness. I will deduct points for illegible notation,\nincluding improper vertical alignment of simultaneous notes. If you're using software, be sure to\noverride the default settings as needed to produce proper vertical spacing of staves, proper\nhorizontal spacing of notes, proper beaming of eighth-notes, and to prevent overlapping marks.\n(Unless you have extensive experience manipulating the software, you'll probably save yourself\ntime by simply writing in manuscript.) Keep in mind that your score must be legible to your\npeers as well as to me, and that it will be photocopied.\n\nLast, but not least: under the bottom staff, identify the key(s) and cadences, and supply Roman\nnumerals and bass figures. On the staves, label each non-triadic tone (\"P,\" \"N,\" \"IN,\" \"sus,\"\n\"ant,\" or \"ped\"), and make sure you've handled each properly (e.g., each passing note is\napproached and departed by step in the same direction, each dissonant suspension is prepared as\na consonance in the preceding harmony and resolves downward by step, etc.).\n\n4. PROCEDURE\n\nI strongly recommend that you compose your melody last, rather than attempt to compose a\nmelody out of the blue and then harmonize it.\n\na) Choose a time signature, a home key, and a phrase structure.\n\nb) Compose a bass line that fits your chosen phrase structure (paying particular attention\nto the necessary cadences), and that incorporates a grammatical succession of harmonies.\n\nc) Compose a well-shaped soprano line; as you do, elaborate the bass line, interpolate\nadditional harmonies, and supply the inner voices.\n\nd) Decorate the soprano line and bass lines with tones of melodic and rhythmic\nfiguration, and adjust the inner voices accordingly. You may find further opportunities to\nelaborate the harmony.\n\ne) Indicate the desired tempo, dynamics, and articulation. (The more expressive\nindications you supply, the better your chances of securing an expressive performance.)\n\nSee the attached demonstration. Note that beyond the required cadences, nothing from my\noriginal bass line is quite graven in stone; elaboration in the later stages of composition often\nrequires altering something that was set out in the initial stages. Whenever you make such\nadjustments, take care that you don't introduce errors of chord construction, voice leading, or\nharmonic syntax.\n\n5. ORNAMENTATION\n\nPlease keep your medium in mind as you introduce tones of melodic and rhythmic figuration:\n\na) If you're writing for SATB choir, remember that le choeur, c'est nous (which translates as,\n\"a group of largely untrained voices\"), and that we'll be sight-reading your piece in class. In\npractical terms, this means you need to demand little in the way of rhythmic complexity (no alla\nzoppa chains of rapid syncopations, no coloratura sixteenth-note passagework) and that you\nhandle dissonances in a fairly conservative fashion (e.g., no large leaps to unprepared dissonant\nneighbor notes).\nNB The preceding does not mean \"avoid dissonances.\" You still can apply dissonances thickly (e.g., create\nsimultaneous dissonant suspensions, let a dissonant passing note in one voice coincide with a dissonant\nneighbor note in another, etc.); it's just a matter of taking care how you approach and depart each one.\n\nb) If you're writing for piano solo, you may create more elaborate figuration, but make sure that\nthe piece is still practical to play. If you're not sure about a passage, consult a pianist. If you\ncan't find a pianist to consult, stick with what you can actually play (in slow motion, at least).\n\nc) If you're writing for melody instrument with keyboard accompaniment, you're limited only by\nyour own technique on the instrument. I recommend keeping the piano accompaniment fairly\nsimple, so as not to upstage your own role as soloist."
