The discussions and debates are intended to demonstrate differences of opinion and enhance awareness of the consequences that these differences had in specific historical contexts. Other issues that will most probably be discussed are theories of beauty, social criticism, light, memory, and landscape.\n\nThe course will portray the history of theory neither as the history of architectural theory exclusively, nor as a series of pre-packaged static pronouncements, but as part of a broader set of issues with an active history that must be continually probed and queried.\n\nTo enhance discussion, three debates will be held in class. Each student will be required to participate in one. They will require planning and preparation as well as group research. Each student will also be required to write three short papers, which require independent research.\n\nGrading\n\nClass participation is essential and will be factored into the final grade. More than 2 absences will result in a full letter-grade devaluation.\n\nThe rough break-down of the grade will be as follows:\n\nACTIVITIES\n\nPERCENTAGES\n\nDebate\n\n30%\n\nPapers\n\n30%\n\nFinal exam\n\n40%\n\nDebate Assignment\n\nEach student is required to participate in at least one debate.

But what is abstraction?\nGreenberg sees abstraction not as pure form in the traditional metaphysical\nsense, but as a type of aesthetic meditation on the art-of art-making: a \"poet's\npoet,' and \"artist's art.\" The result may or may not look 'abstract.' He calls it \"the\nimitating of imitating,\" the \"avant-garde's specialization of itself.\" Ultimately,\nbecause of the dominance of kitsch, the avant-garde is not the NEW but the\n\"preservation of whatever living culture we have right now.\" This means that\nthe purpose of the avant-garde is not necessarily to be avant-garde in the\npolitical sense.\nGreenberg's article presents a historical legitimation of abstraction as well as a\ntheoretical one\n1. society is in a state of decay in which artists and audience no longer\ncommunicate.\n2. In the late 19th century, Bohemianism cut the ties with society.\n3. But this freedom -though it constituted a type of purification - could only\nbe temporary.\n4. A small group of artists emerged who talked in essence to each other.\nThey were their own 'audience.' [thus the creation of what we might call\n'difficult art.'] They imitate \"not God\" but the \"disciplines and processes\"\nof art itself.\n5. A privileged group of elite clients eventually arose who nurtured these\nartists \"by a thread of gold.\"\n6. Unfortunately while this was all taking place, society saw the rise of\nindividualism, Realism, and peasant urban aesthetics leading to kitsch -\nborn in the city - and the industrialization of bad taste.\nClement Greenberg (January 16, 1909 - May 7, 1994) was an influential\nAmerican art critic closely associated with Modern art in the United States. Such\nwas Greenberg's influence as an art critic that Tom Wolfe in his 1975 book The\n\nPainted Word identified Greenberg as one of the \"kings of cultureburg\", alongside\nHarold Rosenberg and Leo Steinberg.

He differentiated between Sehen and Schauen., both which\nmean 'to see.' Sehen, he argues, is to see passively. Schauen is to gaze\nintently. It is a way to 'grasp' reality.

It is not behind the real, but in front of it,\nbetween the real and the human.\nRudolf Arnheim (July 15, 1904 - June 9, 2007) was a German-born\nauthor, art and film theorist and perceptual psychologist.

Revised, enlarged and\npublished as a New Version in 1974, it has been translated into 14\nlanguages, and is very likely one of the most widely read and\ninfluential art books of the twentieth century.\nForm, for Arnheim, is not the abstract metaphysics of Plato. Nor is it\nthe disciplinary 'painting for painters' as agued by Clement\nGreenberg (1939). Form is the mediating realm of 'the human' as a\nphysical and social entity. It is linked with the creative principle as\nderived from Kant. Form is established by great artists and architects.\nThe rise of architectural psychology took place n the 1950s.

Is a anti-metaphysical architecture possible? If so, should it be resisted?\nThe return to language of \"tradition,\" \"culture\" and \"vernacular\" are forms of such\nresistance. Should these in turn be resisted?\nLOCKE\nIn opposition to the hierarchical metaphysics of Plato and Medieval and Renaissance\ntheology, Locke proposed a Law of Nature that, though divine in origin, was not\nmetaphysically based, but outside the bounds of good and evil. The Law of Nature does\nnot impose the language of violence and rupture on society. It sort of 'is.'\nFor Locke, this means that we are constructed from a tabula rasa and thus born free. As a\nresult, once we understand this, we gravitate toward the Social Contract creating social\nunities out of individuals. Contracts - not based on Who we are, but What we can provide\n- is the new language of society. They must be binding and thus become a new type of\nlaw created from WITHIN social conversations. There is, unlike Plato, no explicit\nideology of rupture, no violence for the sake of \"the good.'\nThere is a historical line from: Locke - The Whig Party - English Colonial Mercantilism\n- US Constitution - American Whig Party - Anti-Federalism - Republican Party\nNature remains an open-ended theoretical project to this day.\nMedieval Metaphysics\n(skepticism)\nLocke\nIdea = good = god\nBody politic\nConsensus\n(No metaphysical rupture)\n\nTabula rasa\nmankind\nLaw of Nature (God)\n\nROUSSEAU\nJ.J. Rousseau added complexity to Locke's idea of Nature. Brought metaphysics back\ninto play. We are not born 'free' but in essence imprinted by the proto-politics of Family.\nOnly as adults are we technically 'free,' but in truth do not want to be free as such. We\ncreate 'associations' by which we reduce our freedom for the sake of social participation.\nIn that sense, the Social Contract is a type of invisible (metaphysical) extension of the\n(pre-metaphysical) Family. It is a new type of Family. Think here of something akin to a\nprofessional organization, based on obligations and honesty. Example is the Athenaeum.\nStated\nUnstated\npolitical/honesty\npunishment\nassociations\nenforcement\nmaster/individual\nNature - \"family\"\nCOMMENTARY\nThe argument about 'social body' that was such a part of the Enlightenment's project\nends with a structure that beams itself out into the world at large in the forms of laws,\nregulations, and codes; and finally punishment. It creates the new categories of the\ndeviant, the criminal, and the dishonest. There has to be ways in which society\n'structures' that which escapes its structure. Whereas the usual argument based on the\nEnlightenment's own privileging of 'body politic' is from politics outward into the world\n(outward in a positive sense), Michel Foucault works the argument backward from the\nworld-as-punishment to politics.\n\nBenjamin Henry Latrobe\n\nprofessional discourse\nbooks\nArchitect\npractice\ntheory\nknowledge\nlabor\nthe gentleman\npublic discourse\nthe mechanic\narchitect\n-\nsimilar to Lucian, but puts Architect in the middle\n-\nsplit of the discourse: one professional, one public (Heidegger will try to get rid of\nPUNISHMENT\nMichael Foucault's\nPerspective: in\nreverse/\nthe split)\nThe standard\nnarrative direction\nCODES\nTHE WORLD\ndisciplinary\nknowledgeprecedent\nprofessional discourse\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n4.607 Thinking About Architecture: In History and at Present\nFall 2009\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."
