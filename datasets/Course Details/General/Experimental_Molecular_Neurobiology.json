  "syllabus_content": "Course Meeting Times\n\nLectures: 1 session / week, 2 hours / session\n\nLabs: 1 session / week, 4 hour / session\n\nGeneral Course Information\n\nThis course is divided into two main components:\n\nWet Lab Sessions\n\nLabs will progress linearly in order for the class to acquire basic laboratory skills relevant to molecular neurobiology. Our goal in this class is for each student to learn enough molecular skills to be able to perform experiments successfully in future settings.\n\nEach week we will begin class with a brief overview of the technique covered that day. We will then employ this experimental technique for the remainder of the class period.\n\nPaper Presentations\n\nEach week we will review one paper that elaborates on ideas and techniques that are pertinent to the molecular neuroscience topic of that week.\n\nWe will randomly select three to four students to each present a specific figure from that paper. In addition students will also utilize these figures to discuss the general molecular technique used to collect the figure data and to explain how this technique applies to the paper overall.\n\nEach student will present figures from two papers this semester.\n\nWriting\n\nStudents will have many opportunities to write this semester, for this course fulfills one of the CI-M requirements for course 9 majors.\n\nPaper Questions - Assigned each Week\n\nProfessors Lois and Hayashi will provide the class with six to eight specific questions related to a presentation paper. Students will receive these questions after each presentation and will have one week to answer these questions and to submit these answers for grading.\n\nPresenters and non-presenters alike will have to submit answers to these questions.\n\nReview Essays - Two per Semester\n\nStudents will write a three-page summary and critical review of a scientific paper.\n\nThese essays will be evaluated in two ways. First a scientific writer will analyze the structure, and then the teaching assistant (TA) will analyze the content. The scientific writer will provide feedback that you will use to revise your essay before submitting your paper to the teaching assistant for grading.\n\nLab Reports - Four per Semester\n\nStudents will write a brief (two page) lab report using data collected in the wet lab. These papers can use data from one or many lab weeks, depending on the topics covered.\n\nLab reports consist of a few basic components.\n\nIntroduction: provides an overview of background related to your experiment, how your experiment fits into this background, and your experimental hypothesis for the paper.\n\nMethods: describes techniques/methods used in an experiment and how one collects data from the experiment.\n\nResults: describes the outcome of the experiment using text and figures.\n\nDiscussion: relates the experimental results to the hypothesis and to the overall field of research and explains experiment outcomes, errors, and future directions.\n\nAdditional Information\n\nLaboratory Notebooks\n\nWe will provide students with laboratory notebooks. In the course of performing experiments, you will learn how to properly record methods and data. In general, your lab notebook should be self-explanatory. That is, the notebook should be complete and well organized so that others could use it to accurately repeat your experiments.\n\nWe will periodically evaluate and grade your notebook for content, presentation and organization in order to help you to learn these record-keeping techniques.\n\nPresentations\n\nEach student will have two opportunities to give oral presentations this semester. Figure presentations by each student should last approximately fifteen minutes. We expect students to give computer-based presentations (using Microsoft(r) PowerPoint(r), etc.).\n\nWe will grade you not only on the information that you present, but also on your ability to convey the information. Some points to remember when giving your presentation:\n\nSpeak to your audience; make frequent eye contact.\n\nSpeak slowly, clearly and loudly.\n\nPresent the information on the screen so that it is large enough for all to see it. Typically one has more slides with less text with this method. Remember the common rule of one slide per minute.\n\nAvoid filler words when speaking. Common fillers include, \"um\", \"ah\" and \"like\".\n\nFeel free to contact the teaching assistants or the lab manager for help with any of these points. Practicing in front of a smaller audience can help you when you face a larger one.\n\nParticipation\n\nWe will grade your participation in both the lab sessions and in the presentation sessions.\n\nParticipation in the lab means that you have read and understand the protocol for the week, that you perform your experiments to the best of your ability, and that you are actively learning techniques in the lab.\n\nParticipation in the presentation means that you have read and understand the paper for the week and that you are prepared to answer questions if asked.\n\nEnd of the Year Quiz\n\nIn lieu of a paper presentation the last Wednesday of classes, there will be a class quiz. This quiz will consist of approximately 400 questions given orally in a round-robin manner. We will use this tool to show you all how much information you have acquired over the course of the term.\n\nLab Safety\n\nWhile it is important for you all to learn the molecular techniques that we will teach you this semester, it is equally important that you all are safe while performing these tasks.If you have any questions about lab safety, please contact any of the teaching staff. Additional safety information for this course will not be discussed here, but is placed in the\nlabs\nsection. Please utilize this as a valuable resource.\n\nThe teaching staff will provide all personal protective equipment for students.\n\nRecommended Texts\n\nPrimrose et al.\nPrinciples of Gene Manipulation\n.

      "content": "Guidelines for the presentation\nThese are a few pointers to make the presentation more effective:\n- Remember that your audience are the other students. You have spent some time reading\nabout a particular technique/experiment and your task is to help them understand it better.\n- Avoid jargon. Don't mention jargon if you are not going to explain it, because it only\nconfuses people. For instance, it would be useless to say something like \"... and they\nused PCR to renormalize the dynamic range of stringent positive clones..\", unless you are\ngoing to explain what each of those terms means. For every image or sentence that you\ninclude in your presentation you should think: does this make the other students\nunderstand this point better?\n- The most important part of the presentation is to illustrate why the particular technique\nthat they use allows the authors to come up with their conclusions. Don't just show some\npictures and mention some numbers: explain the logic of why they chose that technique,\nwhat the numbers suggest, how did they come up with that interpretation, what questions\nremains unanswered by that experiment, what could be the next logical step to do, etc...?\n- If there are many ways to do the experiment, try to explain in more detail the way that\nthey authors did their experiment. Don't worry too much about other technical details if\nthey are not used in the paper.\n- Try to connect the technique with the paper. Always use the general motivation of the\npaper as your guide to present the experiment. Put it in the context of what the authors\nare trying to figure out. What would be even better is, after you are done explaining what\nthey did, if you can suggest better ways of answering the question with another\nexperiment."

      "content": "General advice for 9.12 students writing research summaries:\n\n1. Site the paper by Scheiffele et al. (2000) don't provide the whole title. Include\nthe reference for the paper at the end of the document.\n\n2. Start with an overview explaining the area of inquiry, i.e., the intellectual context\nfor the paper. Include the scope of your summary in the overview, i.e., say that\nyou have summarized the results of the eight experiments reported by Scheiffele\nand colleagues.\n\n3. Your summaries of the eight experiments should include the method, rationale,\nresults, and interpretation. Consider devoting one paragraph to each of the\nexperiments. Include the question they've asked, the method, rationale, results,\nand interpretation. If you choose to discuss more than one experiment in a single\nparagraph because they are closely related, make sure your topic sentence reflects\nthis organization.\n\n4. Refer to the authors as \"the researchers\" or \"Scheiffele and colleague\" so you can\nuse active voice, e.g., The researchers examined the role of neuroligins and\nneuroexins in synaptogenesis.\n\n5. Devote each sentence to only one idea - a sentence is a unit of discourse. Write\ntwo sentences if you have two ideas to express (e.g., what they did and why they\ndid it that way).\n\n6. Provide each paragraph with a topic sentence that tells the reader what the\nparagraph is about. A paragraph is also a unit of discourse - one topic per\nparagraph please. Look over your topic sentences after you've written the paper to\nsee if the \"story\" your summary tells is evident in the topic sentences alone.\n\n7. Please make an appointment to see me if you find that you have having too much\ndifficulty with your summary.\n\n8. IF YOU TURN IN A REVISION FOR REGRADING, IT MUST BE DOUBLE\nSPACED AND YOU MUST INCLUDE THE ORIGINAL DRAFT WITH ALL\nOF MY COMMENTS PLUS MY COVER PAGE.\n\nM.P. Ogren"

      "content": "Summary Essay Question\n9.12 Neurobiology Laboratory\nWriting Instructor: Marilee P. Ogren\n\nWrite a well-organized, clearly worded essay about 3 pages long that summarizes the\nmost essential information and points of agreement and disagreement presented in the\nassigned articles. Your task is to inform your readers about the central issues, not to\npersuade them to take a particular viewpoint. Your approach to the material should be\nobjective, not opinionated.\n\nAssume your audience is a group of your peers who have not studied this topic. Do not\ndo any additional reading or research beyond the articles provided. Be sure your paper is\nunderstandable to someone who has not read the original articles.\n\nYou can include at most, two or three direct quotations. Most of the information from the\narticles should be reported by paraphrasing the authors' words (see \"Using the Language\nof Your Source Appropriately\" from the Mayfield handbook, below). You should\ndocument all direct quotations through parenthetical documentation that uses the authors'\nlast name and year of publication (e.g., Lois et al. 2006). Do not add a list of works cited.\n\nThis is what is expected of you:\n- Extract the most essential information and ideas from each reading.\n- Determine how a particular article's information and ideas related to those in the\nother articles (e.g., support, contradict, supplement).\n- Paraphrase the authors' language concisely and accurately but do not copy their\nwords verbatim except in direct quotes.\n- Structure the essay logically and coherently, avoiding superficial or random lists\nof points. Make good use of your introductory and concluding paragraphs, and the\ntopic sentences of the body paragraphs.\n- Write in precise, concise, and engaging prose.\n\nMayfield Electronic Handbook of Technical & Scientific\nWriting\n\nhttp://www.mhhe.com/mayfieldpub/tsw/home.htm\n\nSection 10.1\n\nUsing the Language of Your Source\nAppropriately\n\nIf you use the language of your source, quote the wording exactly.\nThis is called a direct quotation. A direct quotation is either\nenclosed in quotation marks or indented on the page. If you omit\npart of the wording, use an ellipsis (three periods, four if necessary\nfor punctuation to indicate the omission). In any case, several\nwords in succession taken from another source constitute direct\nquotation and must be acknowledged. Indeed, a single word may\nconstitute a direct quotation if it is a word closely identified with a\nparticular author.\n\nA paraphrase employs source material by restating an idea in an\nentirely new form that is original in both sentence structure and\nword choice. Taking the basic structure from a source and\nsubstituting a few words is an unacceptable paraphrase and may be\nconstrued as plagiarism. Creating a new sentence by merging the\nwording of two or more sources is also plagiarism.\n\nThe following examples illustrate the differences between\nacceptable paraphrase and plagiarism.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSource Quotation\n\nA grand unified theory has long been the holy grail of\nphysicists. Since ancient times, physicists have sought\nminimalist explanations of nature. Theories with four\nbasic particles are considered better than theories of\nten.\n\n--Alan Lightman, Ancient Light: Our Changing View of the\nUniverse\n\nUnacceptable Paraphrase\n\nA grand unified theory has long been the central goal\nof scientists. Since the dawn of time, men of science\nhave looked for minimalist explanations of natural\nphenomena. A theory with four elementary particles is\nconsidered better than a theory of ten.\n-------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------\n\nIn the preceding passage, the writer has merely substituted a few\nwords of his or her own for words in the source. The structure and\nthe overall wording of the sentences, however, are Lightman's.\nSince the writer has borrowed Lightman's words as well as his\nideas, the acknowledgment of Lightman as a source does not\nprevent this passage from being plagiarism.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUnacceptable Paraphrase\n\nPhysicists have long had the grand unified theory as\ntheir holy grail. Science always tries to give\nminimalist explanations for natural phenomena. The best\ntheory is the one with the fewest elements.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------\n\nThe structure of the individual sentences in the preceding passage\nis somewhat original, but the order of sentences is clearly taken\nfrom Light man. In addition, the writer has used several phrases\ntaken directly from the source, such as \"minimalist explanations of\nnature.\" Borrowing such phrases without enclosing them in\nquotation marks makes the writer guilty of plagiarism.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAcceptable Paraphrase\n\nPhysicists have long sought a grand unified theory,\nsince scientists have always preferred theories with\nthe fewest elements (Lightman 106).\n-------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------\n\nThis writer has reproduced much of the meaning of Lightman's\npassage but in a sentence that is original in structure and word\nchoice. The only major words and phrases taken from Lightman\nare grand unified theory, theories, and physicists. Such duplication\nis acceptable, since it would be cumbersome to find synonyms for\nthese basic terms."

      "content": "Questions for the julius+ axel paper:\n1. explain what is being done in the top image of figure 1 ,\"gradient fractionation of\nchoroid plexus RNA\". (By explanation I don't mean a simple paraphrasing of what is\nwritten on the text, but a real explanation of why they do it)\nthey centrifuge the rna in a gradient of sucrose so that the heavier RNAs will sink deep\nand the smaller rnas will float. In this way they can size select the RNA for further\nexperiments.\n2. explain the experiment described in figure 8. NIH 373 cells do not have any calcium\nfluctuations when exposed to serotonin. Neurons that have the serotonin receptor DO\nhae calcium fluctuations when exposed to serotonin. If you add the 5HT receptor to\n3t3 cells, they should have calcium fluctuations. First, they transfected a plasmid that\nencodes for the 5HT receptor into 3t3 cells. Then they loaded the cells with a\nchemical that emits a fluorescent signal when calcium levels rise. To measure the\nchanges in fluorescence, they analyze the cells with a fluorescent cell scanner. You\ncan see that only the 3t3 cells that express the 5ht receptor show increases in the\nfluorescent signal,when exposed to 5ht.\n3. Why do they make RNA in vitro (from the cDNA library) to inject into the oocytes?\nBecause if they inject RNA it can directly be translated into a protein simply by injecting\ninto the cytoplasm. If they inject DNA, they would have to hit the nucleus of the oocyte,\nwhich is very difficult.\n4. The human (or rat ) genome has approx. 30,000 genes. Why do they make a library\nthat has 1,2 million clones?\nTo make sure that they have complete coverage of low abundance genes, and to make\nsure that in some cases they have full length cDNAs\n5. the gene that they identified is 3kb, but in the northern in figure 10. They mention that\nit is really 5.2 KB. Why the discrepancy?\nThe mrna has untranslated regions (UTRs) that are not part of the protein coding region.\nIn this case, those UTRs account for the extra 2 kb.\n6. Fig 10: why is the actin band from the heart smaller than actin in any other tissues?\nThere are many kinds of forms of actin. The heart, being a contractile organ has a\ndifferent kind of actin that most other parts of the body. Because heart's actin has a\nsequence similar to the rest of the body, it is still recognized by the probe. However,\nbecause it is encoded by a different gene, it produces a different mRNA which has a\ndifferent size.\n\n7. Legend of figure 1: \"..transcribed in vitro in the presence of the cap precursor\nGpppG...\". Why do they need the GpppG?\nThe ribosome from the oocyte will not translate an mRNA unless it is capped by the\nGpppG.\n8. A gene is expressed in a particular cell because it is selectively transcribed there. For\ninstance: the serotonin receptor is expressed in the choroid plexus, but not in the liver.\nHow do they manage to express serotonin receptor in the frog oocyte?\nAs long as they provide the right mRNA (plus the cap and the polyA), the frog oocyte\nwill translate anything that you out it, even if it usually doesn't express that gene\nendogenously.\n9. The oocyte is clearly not an electrically active cell. How come if you put a serotonin\nreceptor now it becomes \"neuron-like\", and it is responsive to neurotransmitters?\nAll cells have a membrane potential (which is usually -70 mV). Neurons have, in\naddition to other ion channels, voltage-gated sodium channels which are responsible for\nthe firing of action potentials. If you put other channels into cells that are usually non-\nexcitable, they will be able to modify their membrane potential.\n10. figure 3. They inject a pool of 100,000 clones (!) and they get a electrical signal when\nthe cell is exposed to serotonin. How do they know which of the 100,000 clones is\nthe responsive one? How do they do to eventually isolate the \"real\" serotonin\nreceptor , if they start with a pool of 100,000?\nThe key here is that the serotonin receptor is not a channel by itself. Like the olfactory\nreceptor, the activation of the serotonin receptor is coupled to a G-protein, which will\nactivate a channel. Thus, there is an amplification cascade between the serotonin\nreceptor and the channel that is triggers to open. In their experiment, if the serotonin\nreceptor was by itself a chennle, they would not have been able to detect it, because there\nwould be no amplification cascade by the G-protein intermediary.\n11. Why do they transfect fibroblasts with DNA but they inject RNA into the oocytes?\nBecause they want to make a cell line that permanently expresses the serotonin\nreceptor, they want to make sure that the DNA that they transfect will integrate\npermanently into the genome. If they were to inject RNA into the fibroblast, the\nRNA will degrade in a few hours, and they would not be have been able to have a cell\nline that permanently expressed the receptor. For the oocyte, it is a different story:\nthey just want to express protein for a few hours, and after that, they throw away the\noocyte. In addition, there is question of injecting into the nucleus versus cytoplasm\nthat we mentioned before (question 3).\n\n12. Why do they put the serotonin receptor in the \"..expression vector pMV7\" when they\nwant to transfect it into fibroblasts? Why do they have an \"independent cassette\nencoding neomycin..\"?.\nTo express a cDNA in mammalian cells they need a specific promoter, and the pMV7 is\nsuch a promoter. As opposed to that, a bacterial promoter would not have worked in that\ncase. They need the neomycin cassette to be able to select for the cells that have\nincorporated the transfected gene. The plasmid that they transfected has both the\nserotonin cDNA and neomycicn. They cannot do anything to directly enrich the cells\nthat have serotonin and discard the cells that don't. However, if a cell does not have the\nneomycin cassette and you grow the cells with neomycin, they will die. In contrast, if a\nfew cells have the neomycin cassette (you grow the cells with neomycin), only those cells\nwill survive. Now, if you have transfected BOTH serotonin receptor and the neomycin\ncassette, and you are selecting for neomycin, you will indirectly will be selecting for the\ncells that also have serotonin receptor.\n13. figure 4: how do they know that out the 3 kb clone that they have, the protein coding\nregion is only 1400 base pairs?\nBecause they look for the ORF in the sequence, like you did in the computer exercise,\nand they realize that there is a lot of UTR before and after the protein coding region of\nthe gene.

      "content": "Questions for the julius+ axel paper:\n1. explain what is being done in the top image of figure 1 ,\"gradient fractionation of\nchoroid plexus RNA\". (By explanation I don't mean a simple paraphrasing of what is\nwritten on the text, but a real explanation of why they do it)\n2. explain the experiment described in figure 8.\n3. Why do they make RNA in vitro (from the cDNA library) to inject into the oocytes?\n4. The human (or rat ) genome has approx. 30,000 genes. Why do they make a library\nthat has 1,2 million clones?\n5. the gene that they identified is 3kb, but in the northern in figure 10. They mention that\nit is really 5.2 KB. Why the discrepancy?\n6. Fig 10: why is the actin band from the heart smaller than actin in any other tissues?\n7. Legend of figure 1: \"..transcribed in vitro in the presence of the cap precursor\nGpppG...\". Why do they need the GpppG?\n8. A gene is expressed in a particular cell because it is selectively transcribed there. For\ninstance: the serotonin receptor is expressed in the choroid plexus, but not in the liver.\nHow do they manage to express serotonin receptor in the frog oocyte?\n9. The oocyte is clearly not an electrically active cell. How come if you put a serotonin\nreceptor now it becomes \"neuron-like\", and it is responsive to neurotransmitters?\n10. figure 3. They inject a pool of 100,000 clones (!) and they get a electrical signal when\nthe cell is exposed to serotonin. How do they know which of the 100,000 clones is\nthe responsive one? How do they do to eventually isolate the \"real\" serotonin\nreceptor , if they start with a pool of 100,000?\n11. Why do they transfect fibroblasts with DNA but they inject RNA into the oocytes?\n12. Why do they put the serotonin receptor in the \"..expression vector pMV7\" when they\nwant to transfect it into fibroblasts? Why do they have an \"independent cassette\nencoding neomycin..\"?\n12. figure 4: how do they know that out the 3 kb clone that they have, the protein coding\nregion is only 1400 base pairs?"

      "content": "Buck and axel:\n1. why do the use mRNA instead of genomic DNA as starting material?\nOne criteria of olfactory receptor is that it is expressed only in nasal epithelium\nbut not in other region. If one starts from genomic DNA, there is no guarantee that\nwhatever amplified by PCR belongs to olfactory receptor gene family. Also, the\ngenomic DNA contains both exon and intron. There is no guarantee that there is no\nintrons between the two regions selected to design PCR primers. If there is intron(s)\nbetween the two regions, first PCR may not work. Also, the size of PCR product\ncannot be a selection criterion of candidate gene.\n2. How did they design the oligos for PCR? Based on which assumption?\nOlfactory receptors belong to 7-transmembrane G-protein coupled receptor. At\nthat point, there was a dozen of such receptor family already known (rhodopsin,\nbeta-adrenergic receptor etc). By comparison between these genes, one can find\nhomologous region with in this family of protein. They assumed that the olfactory\nreceptor protein also share the same sequence feature.\n3. What is the difference between figure 2a and 2B?\nWhat does it mean?\nExplain the results for lanes 12 and 13.\n2A is before digestion with HinfI and 2B is after. 2A is to confirm that the size of\nPCR products are within expected range as G-protein coupled receptor. 2B test if\nthe bands consist of multiple different DNA or not. In 2B lane 13 consists multiple\nbands which sum up much longer than undigested DNA. This is indicative of\npresence of multiple species of fragments in undigested DNA. In contrast, the\n\nlength of digested DNA will add up to the length of undigested DNA in lane 12\n(compare with marker).\n4. How many \"genes\" are there in lane 13?\nThe authors estimated that the length sum to 5- to 10-fold of the undigested\nDNA. This means there are at least 5-10 different genes.\n5. If they get a band like fig2. A, lane 12: does it rule out that it is really an olfactory\nreceptor?\nIt is still possible that this particular primer pair only amplified single species of\nolfactory receptor.\n6. Would they get any PCR products if they use a brain cDNA library? Before\nanswering remember the design of the oligos.\nThe oligos are designed to detect G-protein family receptor. It is possible that\nother G-protein coupled receptor (but not olfactory receptor) is cloned.\n7. In fig 3: why do they do a northern blot with 20 probes? Wouldn't they loose\nspecificty? How do they know which probe is hybridizing to which target in the\nnorthern? What are those 2 bands?\nThere is ~1000 olfactory receptor genes and if one use only one probe and\neach of may be expressed only in a small fraction of olfactory receptor. Therefore,\nthe amount of expression may not be sufficient to detect if they use only one probe.\nThe two bands may correspond to different subtypes of olfactory receptor.\n\n8. Why do they use a cdna library to get full length cdna clones? Why not do it by\nPCR?\nOne can try 5' RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA end) and 3' RACE to get\nfull-length clone. For RACE, one use primer that anneals to a know part of cDNA\nand another primer in the vector (phage vector or plasmid vector, which is already\nknown) sequence. This will allow one to get unidentified portion of cDNA. However,\nif you have a sufficiently long cDNA fragment which you can use as probe,\nscreening cDNA library using plaque hybridization is more standard. One reason is\nthat PCR tends to incorporate mutations. Second reason is that it does not involve\nfurther work to connect original PCR fragment with new ones.\n9. Fig3, why do they isolate polyA+ RNA? Are there rna's with no polyA+?\nTransfer RNA and ribosomal RNA do not have polyA. Also, there are a number\nof minor RNAs such as shRNA, do not have polyA either. There are also messenger\nRNAs lacking polyA. Some of mRNAs coding nuclear protein belong to such family.\nHiston is a typical example.\n10. How come you can figure out the number of genes by doing a southern blot (fig\n7)? Why do they genomic DNA instead of cDNA from a library? Could you do the\nsame with a northern blot?\nRestriction enzyme digests various olfactory receptor DNA into fragment at\ndifferent length. In addition, if you cut with 6 cutters such as EcoRI or HindIII\n(appears 1 out of 4kb), the average fragment should contain only 1 receptor. By\ndoing blotting at low stringency and counting the number of positive bands, one\n\nshould be able to estimate the number of family protein. In contrast, mRNA has less\ndiverse in their length. It seems to be around 2 kb in Northern blotting even they\nused a mixture of 20 different cDNA as probe. So this makes it difficult to estimate\nthe number of genes. From the same reason, it is difficult to estimate the number of\nindependent gene using southern blotting against cDNA.\n.\n11. What does it mea n to hybridize a library at high stringency?\nWhy would you\nwant to do that?\nDNA double helix is stabilized at low temperature and high salt concentration.\nIf you use higher temperature and low salt concentration, only a perfectly matched\nDNA anneals together. By using such condition, one can identify DNA fragment\nexactly matches the probe.\n12. Fig 7: what does it mean that they do not 'cross-hybridize\"?\nUnder low temperature and high salt concentration, even the mismatched\nDNA can anneal together. It is called low stringency. If you want to detect other\nmembers of the same family, you can use low stringency.\n13. these genes have no introns: how does this factor affect the choice of source of\nnuclei acid for PCR? What would be the results if you use: a) mRNA after reverse\ntranscription, b) cDNA from a library, c) genomic DNA form the olfactory\nepithelium, d) genomic DNA from the liver.\nOlfactory cDNA made by RT reaction (a) or olfactory cDNA library (b) should\namplify olfactory receptor. Genomic DNA from olfactory epithelium and liver (c and\nd) may be also used but G-protein coupled genes other than olfactory receptor may\n\nbe also amplified and requires extra effort to characterize it. (c) and (d) should give\nidentical results. The length of product, if any, will be approximately the same\nbecause there is no intron in-between.\n14. What does it mean to do \"nested\" PCR? Why do they do nested PCr to make\nsure that the clones that they pick are what they really want?\nIn nested PCR, one first amplifies DNA with a pair of primers and then\nrecovers the PCR product. Using it as a template, the second round PCR will be\ncarried out using primers located with in the product region. Because two sets of\nprimers determine the specificity, it will be more accurate than only one set is used.\nErroneous products amplified with only first set of primer will not be amplified in the\nsecond PCR.\n15. By doing northern blot they confirm that the genes are expressed in olfactory\nepithelium. Explain the logic they use to assume that it is likely that these genes are\nexpressed in olfactory neurons.\nIt has been postulated that the cilia of olfactory neuron is the site of odor\ndetection (p175, right column). Selective removal of cilia abolishes the olfactory\nresponse. The specific binding of amino acid (in fish, it is odorant), is found in cilia.\nAlso, by application of odorant, adenylate cyclase is activated GTP dependently\nand open cyclic nucleotide gated channels in cilia.\n16. Do they really know which cells express the genes? What could they do to\nreally make sure where the genes are expressed? PCR? Northern? Other\ntechniques?\n\nIn situ hybridization will be the best technique to identify the cell type\nexpressing a certain gene. One can counter-stain tissue to identify cell types."

      "content": "GENERAL LAB SAFETY NOTES\nFor Students\nPROPER ATTIRE:\n\nProper laboratory attire includes the following for all labs:\no Closed toe shoes\no Long pants\no Hair longer than shoulders pulled back\nIf need more protection than normal, the lab will provide the\nfollowing items:\no Disposable lab coats\no Protective eyewear\no Disposable masks\no Disposable gloves\nIf any/ all of these items are necessary, then we will inform\nstudents prior to class. We will lie out necessary protective\ngear before class begins, and note where they can find these\nmaterials.\n\nLAB SAFETY EQUIPMENT:\n\nThere are three hoods in the lab that flank the sink in the far\ncorner of the room. Two are culture hoods that the 9.12 class\nwill use, and the other is a fume hood (general for both classes).\nNote the differences between these two hoods and their uses:\no Fume hoods vent from the back and filter noxious\nchemicals.\no Culture hoods vent from the front and if used properly,\nmaintain sterile environments.\nThere are also individual snorkel vents located over every\nworkstation on the lab benches. Please turn these on if you are\nworking with noxious materials (such as preserved brains). To\nopen the vent, turn the long dial on the side of the vent.\n\nThere are four sharps containers located in the room. Two are\nstationed behind the middle lab bench. Two are in the far corner\nof the room next to the animal vestibule. Objects that one can\nplace in these containers include but are not limited to:\no Glass slides\no Pipets (glass or hard plastic)\no Syringes\no Scalpel blades\no Other broken glass or metal objects.\nThese items may or may not be bio-hazardous. Note however,\nthat one can dispose of sharp materials ONLY in these bins.\nRegular trash is not permitted.\nN.B. Never place a scalpel blade on a handle or remove it. For\nyour safety, leave this job to the teaching staff.\n\nThere are three wash stations in the lab. Two are eyewash, and\none is a shower. The first eyewash is located next to the sink.\nThe second eyewash and the shower are next to each other and\nare located behind the middle lab bench and next to the\nicemaker. Do NOT pull the shower cord unless there is an actual\nemergency use for it or else you will flood the lab.\n\nWASTE DISPOSAL:\n\nThere are few chemicals that can go down the sink or throw away\nin the regular trash. Unless specifically told otherwise, treat all\nsolutions/chemicals as if they cannot go down the sink.\nFor chemical waste- There are containers for both solid and\nliquid waste located on the floor next to the fume hood. There\nare multiple liquid waste containers in a satellite container, each\nfor different chemicals. Contact the lab manager or a teaching\nassistant before disposing ANY lab waste, so that we properly\n\ndiscard the waste. If there is a full waste container, liquid or\nsolid, contact the lab manager.\n\nFor bio-hazardous waste- Sharp biohazard waste should be\ndiscarded in the sharps containers (see above). For all other\nbiohazard waste, the lab manager will have biohazard bags. We\nwill alert students to the location of the bag and what must be\nplaced in the bag at the beginning of a lab session. Please place\nthe proper waste in the bag, and the lab manager will dispose the\nwaste properly.\n\nEMERGENCY INFORMATION:\n\nThere is an EHS packet of information by the phone. The phone\nis located next to the animal vestibule door. This packet tells one\nwhat to do in case of a chemical, biological, etc. emergency. Know\nthe location of this packet for use.\n\nCLEANING SUPPLIES AND GENERAL CLEANING INFO:\n\nAll cleaning agents for the lab are located under the sink. These\ninclude the following:\no Alconox\no Bleach\no Lysol disinfectant\no Fantastik\no Sporocidin (virucide, bactericide, fungicide)\no Extra sponges\no Extra hand soap\nThere will always be an open bottle of hand soap to the\nright sink. A sponge and cleaning brush are located to the\nleft of the sink. There is usually a bucket of soapy water to\nthe left of the sink also.\n\nFor general reference, the lab manager convention is that\neverything to the left of the sink is dirty, and everything to the\nright of the sink is clean. For example, if one uses scissors to cut\ntissue, then those scissors should be placed to the left of the\nsink for cleaning when one is finished with them. Clean items are\nalso place on clean diapers to dry. Note that the diapers are on\nthe right side of the sink only.\n\nMISCELLANEOUS INFORMATION:\n\nMake sure to leave the lab/lab station as you found it. A clean\nlab is a happy lab, and a happy lab is a happy lab manager.\nIf one needs gloves in the lab, remember to change them often.\nIf you are unsure if something is clean or dirty, treat it as dirty.\nIf you are unsure if a chemical can go down the sink, treat it as if\nit cannot.\nAlways ask questions. If you cannot find something or don't know\nwhat to do, ask a member of the teaching staff.\nNever be apprehensive about asking for help."

measuring syrinder\nPour 50 ml of TAE buffer in a 200 ml bottle\nMeasure 1 gram of agarose in a weigh boat\nAdd agarose to bottle and swirl thoroughly\nLoosen cap and put in microwave for 2 minutes at low power (4)\nMake sure that contents do not boil and spill over\nAdd the rest of TAE to the bottle and mix well by swirling\nAdd 5 μl of ethidium bromide to liquid in bottle\nSwirl (without making bubbles)\nCast get with two 12 tooth combs (one on top row and one in bottom)\nAdd agarose into cast and let solidify\nWait 15 minutes (while you wait, precipitate the genomic DNA as explained below)\nOnce is solid, remove comb, turn the cast 90 degrees, and add approx. 400 ml of TAE\nbuffer, until the liquid starts to cover the gel\n\nProtocols\nPrecipitation of DNA (this is separate experiment to be done while waiting for digestion and electrophoresis)\nInto a 1.5 ml eppendorf tube, add:\n40 μl of genomic DNA\n5 μl of sodium acetate 3 M\n100 μl of 100% ethanol\nMix well by shaking\nSpin in centrifuge at maximun speed for 5 minutes\nDiscard supernatant in waste bucket\nAdd 1 ml of 70% ethanol\nDiscard supernatant in waste bucket (make sure that your remove all you can by inverting\ntube on a piece of paper and gently tap the tube to eliminate all remaining drops)\nAir dry tube for 5 minutes\nAdd 10 μl of water to bottom of tube\nTap bottom of tube to ensure mixing of water and pellet\nSpin down for 3 seconds\nDo you see something on the bottom?\n\nProtocols\nRunning of DNA digests and precipitation\nLoad 4 μl of 1Kb DNA ladder in first well\nMix 2 μl of loading buffer (LB tube) with each of the digests that you prepared before\nLoad 23 μl of each of the digest+loading buffer in each well\nAdd 3 μl of loading buffer to the precipitated genomic DNA, and load into a well\nThe loading order should be:\n1kb ladder-FUGW (BaMHI)- FUGW (BglII)-FUGW (BamHI and BglII)-FUGW (no\nenzyme)- genomic DNA (BglII) -FUCedW (BglII)- FUCed (no enzyme)-precipitated\ngenomic DNA (plus empty wells)\nOnce everything is loaded, set voltage to 150 volts and start running the gel\nRun gel for 15 minutes\nStop gel and take image with UV light\n\nReport\n- What is the relationship between migration\ndistance and molecular weight?\n- How can you calculate unknown DNA size?\n- How many BamHI and BglII sites are there?\n- How are they arranged?\n- Draw a \"restriction enzyme map\" of FUWG\n- What is the smeary pattern?\n(No introduction, method, etc needed for today. Just\nthe result of you analysis and a map of the plasmid.\nWrite about possibilities.)"
