  "syllabus_content": "Course Meeting Times\n\nLectures: 2 sessions / week, 3 hours / session\n\nCourse Overview\n\nThis seminar engages in the notion of space from various points of departure. The goal is first of all to engage in the term and secondly to examine possibilities of art, architecture within urban settings in order to produce what is your interpretation of space.\n\nToday's lack of public spaces due to privatization leaves little room for truly public discourse. How can art and architecture renegotiate the \"res publica\" - a space for a multitude of voices - the fundament for democracy? Texts by theoreticians such as Bachelard, Lefebvre, Bataille, Foucault, Harvey, Fraser, Hayden, Hollier, Bourdieu, Klein just to name a few will be intertwined with lectures by practitioners from various fields from outside and within MIT.\n\nWhile there have been many points of confluence historically between art and architecture, the specificity of these relationships and how they are \"embedded\" in the urban fabric often remains unacknowledged within the discourses of both disciplines. This course will introduce discourses in architecture and urbanism with a focus on the notion of space seeking how they could act complicit. Such potential points of contact and their differin discourses will be introduced through a series of public discussions around heterogeneous approaches to re-engage in the need of a public sphere.\n\nThe seminar is organized around external input considered as lab time on the Monday nights@VAP, a mix of lectures, screenings and debates that are open to the public. Wednesdays are for course students only. Here we debate and deepen questions arising out of the Monday night events and go through additional material such as texts and background material on the topic of the course including historical references. The project of the course intends to form small teams to develop various spaces of communication and exchange, and last but not least to experience what is your interpretation of space. The students will be asked to develop and test possibilities of how to create with limited means a variety of spatial narratives.\n\nThe Wednesday classes will be broken in to two parts:\n\nLecture and debate\n\nGroup work\n\nAt mid term the groups will introduce their proposal and at the finals the groups are expected to present their \"spaces\" to a public.

Much smaller in their scale, the\nwearable instrumentations share with these\nmonumental projections similar psychological\nand political objectives. The aim of both projects\nis to inspire and assist the users-animators in\ndeveloping, perfecting, and \"projecting\" their\nvoice and gestures in public space.\nBoth projections and instrumentations require a\npreparatory video recording (and re-recording)\nprocess that psychologically and politically\nengages participants and aids in constructing\ntheir testimonies. Through this process,\nparticipants gradually recover and develop\nthe mastery and artistry of public speaking.\nStep by step they recall, articulate and convey\noverwhelming life experiences. Armed with\nnew psycho-cultural prosthetic equipment, and\nempowered with the prestige and monumental\nscale of civic edifices, they become prominent\nfearless speakers.\nThe main objective of the use of media in these\nprojections and instrumentations is to create a\ntransitional psychological space that encourages\na gradual passage from participants' traumatic\nsilence or traumatized speech toward a confident\narticulate voice. In this way, their psycho-political\ndevelopment, to which Wodiczko's projects seek\nto contribute, may help participants to become\nnot only frank transmitters of truth, but also\ncritical and passionate animators of public space.\nSince 1980, Krzysztof Wodiczko, Professor of\nVisual Arts and a Director of the Center for\nAdvanced Visual Studies, 2004 recipient of\nMIT's Kepes Award, has throughout his career\ndeveloped a series of tools and devices for urban\ninterventions. In addition his work has been\nexhibited in numerous international festivals and\nexhibitions ranging from Biennales in Paris, Sao\nPaulo, Helsinki, Kyoto and Venice, to the Whitney\nBiennial, Documenta and the International Center\nfor Photography Triennial.\nKrzysztof Wodiczko's next public projections are\nplanned to take place in Caracas in 2007 and his\nmost recent commission is by the city of Nantes,\nto design a Memorial commemorating the\nAbolition of Slavery in France (opening in 2007).\nDirections\nThe Visual Arts Program at MIT is located above\nthe MIT Museum.

      "content": "The Mary Otis Stevens Collection\nA New Gift to the MIT Museum\n\nThe MIT Museum has recently received the archives of Mary Otis Stevens (SBArch, 56),\none of the most important female architects in the Northeast during the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nInitially a protege of Walter Gropius, Stevens partnered with her husband Thomas\nMcNulty (MArch 49) from 1956 to 1969. One of their most important projects was the\n1965 Lincoln House, designed for themselves and their three small sons, in Lincoln MA.\n\nPerhaps the first house in the US to be built of glass and exposed concrete, it was an\ninstant sensation in the international architectural press on the cover of Architectural\nForum and Deutsche Bauzeitung and widely featured in the large-circulation press, as\nwell. But it rocked the little town of Lincoln the same way the Gropius House had in the\nlate 1930s. (Neighbors speculated since there were no windows facing the street, the\noccupants must have been nudists.)\n\nFor Lincoln House, Stevens and McNulty enlisted movement and hesitation as their basic\ndesign concepts. The originality of the house stemmed from the architects' rejection of\npreset notions of what a house was, freeing them to transfer their own ideas about\nmovement and hesitation on the scale of the city to the scale of the house.\n\nTo maximize freedom and movement in the house, for instance, the architects eliminated\nmost interior doors, fostering movement not only between the different areas of the\ninterior, but also between the inside and the outside. \"We wanted to make the house into\na kind of miniature city\", says Stevens. \"It was very urban. The idea was to bring people\ntogether, not isolate them in boxes on different floors. You had choices all the time.\"\n\nApart from the unique space created by using urban concepts of movement in the setting\nof a single-family house, the Lincoln House was also one of the first with a curvilinear\ngeometry, giving the building a sculptural quality. (Life called it a sculpture for living in.)\nThe Lincoln House also served as a sundial: sited so that its longitudinal axis was exactly\nN-S, each cloudless day at noon a streak of light would shoot down the stairs and extend\nits length, as the afternoon wore on, along the pathway leading to the children's area.\n\nIn the 1960s, Stevens and McNulty founded iPress, Inc., which Stevens directed from\n1968-1978, making a major contribution to architectural and urban theory with books\nfocusing on the social context of architecture, such as The Ideal Communist City by\nAlexei Gutnov and Towards a Non-Oppressive Environment by Alexander Tzonis.\n\nIn 1970, she and McNulty published their own classic work, World of Variation, looking\nat the city as a social realm, identifying then-current problems and possible design\nsolutions. They also collaborated with Gyorgy Kepes, founder of\nMIT's Center for Advanced Studies, on the design of the City at Night exhibit at the 1968\nTriennale, where they used moving lines of light, each line programmed with a different\ntime sequence, to turn a 100-foot corridor into a place celebrating human movement.\n\nIn 1975, Stevens founded the Design Guild, a collaborative architectural practice focused\non non-profit clients, historic preservation and adaptive re-use; the Guild disbanded in\n1991.\n\nLast fall, the new museum collection was inventoried and catalogued by Katharina\nMaria Tanzberger, a 2006 graduate of the University of Applied Arts Vienna, who was\nintroduced to Stevens' work by her professor, Liane Lefaivre. Intrigued by the notion of a\nhouse with no doors (Tanzberger was raised in just such a place) she was drawn to\nexploring Stevens' work further, writing a research paper and eventually coming to MIT\nto work on the archive.\n\nThe collection consists of more than 300 drawings and diagrams, as well as many texts.\nOf particular interest is the large collection of the sketches over the years, sketches that\ndiffer from the architectural drawings of the prewar period in that they were not\nrenderings of facades or elevations but rather diagrams charting the flow of movement.\n\nThe Stevens collection is a companion to the McNulty papers held by the MIT Archives.\nMcNulty was a member of MIT?s architecture faculty from 1949 to 1956, when he went\ninto private practice with Stevens. For six years he also taught at the University of\nPetroleum and Minerals in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, as professor of architecture.\n\nThis article is based in part on \"Living Outside the Box: Marty Otis Stevens and Thomas\nMcNulty's Lincoln House\" by Professor Liane Lefaivre, Chair of Architectural History\nand Theory at the University of Applied Art in Vienna. It appeared in Harvard Design\nMagazine, Number 24, Spring/Summer 2006."

While Foucault, along with Lefebvre would\nstress the importance of space as an organizing historical tool, there is little discussion of the\nphysical phenomenon of these heterotopias. While MIT as an institution is ripe with culturally het\nerotopic spaces, we are concerned with exploring heterotopias of scale and use.\n\nIn order to accomplish this task we chose string to as a medium through which to explore\nthe boundaries between these spaces. String is especially apt to serve in this role because of its\nlimited cultural associations and because it is in itself a heterotopic material. While possessing\nwhat amounts to no mass on its own, string has the amazing ability to create volume not by sheer\namount, but through appeasing the physiological phenomenon of gestalt.\nKey Text: Gaston Bachelard 'The Poetics of Space'\nLocation: Building 3 Staircase\nPaths have an ability to create their own boundaries. By mapping move\nment across departments and floor, certain boundaries are made evi\ndent-boundaries between safety/danger, security/fear. This installation\nrecognizes a space that cannot be occupied defining a space that is\noccupied. By examining the threshold we hoped to give presence to a\nspace of physical use juxtaposed with a space of phenomenological use.\nScale: Social scale\nInteraction: Dynamic, proximal\nThis exploration not only helped to refine our conceptual framework, it\nrevealed the potential phenomenological power of the string.\n\nLocation: Killian Court telephone\nKey Text: Michel Foucault 'Crime and Punish'\nWhat are the implicit boundaries that divide heterotopic spaces? We\nwanted to examine how one interacts with these spaces, and can they\nbe divided into their component uni-topias? What is the experience of\nmoving between these spaces of different uses? How do interventions\nin the space heighten one's awareness off uncanny relationships?\nScale: Personal\nInteraction: Penetrating boundaries, crossing thresholds\nAs our visual language of delineating boundaries became more refined\nand increasingly flat, it spurred us to look for thresholds of greater\ndepth.\nLocation: Light well between Rotch Library and Building 7\nKey Text: Michel Foucault 'Of Other Spaces'\nWhile the first exploration drew boundaries around a place that cannot\nbe inhabited, and the second examined corporeal thresholds, the most\nrecent incarnation is an examination of the space of the boundary itself.\nThe threshold in this installation is not a static, infinitely thin division\nbetween spaces, rather it is a dynamic zone that is perceived differently,\ngiven the entry point, the point of observation or the route through the\nspace.\nThis installation resonates with our first exploration in the stairwell.\nWhile the well around which the stairs spiral is an essential part of the\nexperience of climbing/descending, the seam between building 7 and\nRotch disappears if one is not moving through the space because of its\nnarrowness. The only real occupation of the space is limited to a re\nstricted zone of the library, save the Athena terminals and the bridge.\nSimilar to the stairwell, this space is an organizing feature and plays a\nlarge role in the use of the space, but is an invisible architecture whose\npresence is suppressed. Our intervention attempts to express the sub\ntle undulations in perception that exist in the space, given each locations\nvision of adjoining spaces. The contour of the installation is modified by\nthe points of privilege and power inherent in the space.\nScale: Attenuated\nInteraction: Static, observed from a few privileged observation points"

Arch III\nAlice Rosenberg, M.Arch I\n\nProject Description\nWe began with an interest in mapping South Station as a nexus point in the Boston\nmetropolitan region, and pursued the idea of data collection. However, we felt that the\nproject needed to engage with the actual space and create personal interactions. We\ntherefore shifted from our original focus of information gathering and statistical mapping\nto using the act of survey to engage in Debord's derive.\n\nIn our first stage of the derive, we asked participants to identify their favorite place in\nBoston and elicited personal information. We hoped to have people map how to get\nfrom one place to the next, so that we could follow their instructions and continue the\nsurvey process at the next location. We also hoped that it would provide us with a form\nof trace, or record, for a map. We also wanted to see if we would push boundaries by\nasking for participant's cell phone numbers in case we got lost. Finally, in an attempt to\nprovide connection between people being interviewed, we asked the person what they\nwould like to know of the second and would contact them if they wished.\n\nWe found that the participants willingly gave personal information, but the map\ngenerating procedure was unsuccessful. The best elements of the derive were\ngenerated by the participant providing a question for then next interview and the\nphotographic documentation of the derive.\n\nThe basic methodology of our final derive was similar to the previous derive: we\nselected participants at random to survey, and used their answers to determine our next\nlocation. This time, however, we asked fewer questions and selected questions to gain\npersonal information that would contribute to our multi-media (psycho-geographic) map.\nWe combined this information with video and photographic recording of the derive\nprocess to create our final ten-minute audio-visual presentation.\n\nRe-Imagining Boston\n\nCharles Curan, M.Arch I\nDouglas Dunlap, M.Arch I\nMeredith Fuhrman, M.Arch I\nYoung-Ju Kim, M.Arch III\nAlice Rosenberg, M.Arch I\n\nTheoretical Framing\nOur primary inspiration for this project was Guy Debord's \"Theory of the Derive.\" We\nwere particularly interested in his concept of psycho-geography, or one's experience\nthrough the modern city being a chartable experience itself:\n\nThe lessons drawn from derives enable us to draft the first surveys of the\npsycho-geographical articulations of a modern city. [...] With the aid of maps,\naerial photographs and experimental derives, one can draw up hitherto lacking\nmaps of influence, maps whose inevitable imprecision at this early stage is no\nworse than that of the earliest navigational charts. The only difference that it is no\nlonger a matter of precisely delineating stable continents, but of changing\narchitecture\nand\nurbanism.\n[Theory\nof\nthe\nDerive,\nDebord\nwww.bopsecrets.org/SI/2.derive.htm]\n\nWe adopted some of the guidelines established by Debord for a successful derive:\n1) For our derives, one group was composed of 2 people and the others of 3,\naccording to Debord's suggestion that the most \"fruitful\" groups were of that size.\n2) Each of our derives were attended by a different assemblage of people within our\nproject group (and one included people from outside our class), \"It is preferable\nfor the compositions of these groups to change from one derive to another.\"\n3) Our derives took approximately six hours, reasonably close to the period\nproposed by Debord: \"The average duration of a derive is one day, considered\nthe time between two periods of sleep.\"\n\nDebord suggests that there may be two purposes for derives, which are \"[...] to study a\nterrain [and] emotionally disorient oneself.\" Our goal was the former: we wanted to\ncreate a new way of exploring Boston, as well as gain snap-shot understandings of\nwhat Bostonians find interesting. Through this, we constructed a psycho-geography of\nurban Boston according to people's favorite places in the city. We enfolded within the\nderive the idea of survey (generated from an earlier conception of our project). As such,\nthe critical elements of the project were the acts of interacting with participants, eliciting\ninformation from them, and recording their responses. The project result did not take the\nform of a traditional two-dimensional map. Instead, we sought to generate a multi-media\nrepresentation of our journeys and interactions."

Homember It\nA Container for Remembered Space\n\nGroup Members:\nNajiyah Edun, MArch I\nCharlie Byrd Hagen-Cazes, MArch I\nKate James, SMVisS I\nMorgan Pinney, MArch I\nJohn Pugh, MArch I\n\nProject Scope\n\nThe departure 'space' for this art/architecture project is the space of memories.\nMemories exist eternally but only in response to the lost temporal spaces they represent.\nHerein lies the paradox that makes any remembered space formally elusive. Thus, our\nfirst problem was determining a language/form with which to capture our own\n'remembered spaces'. We began by drawing simple floor plans of all our homes to date.\n\nThe results of our self-imposed exercise were surprisingly rich. We reported a range of\nemotional and reflective experiences. In analyzing our observations of the process of\ndrawing/remembering, one of the most intriguing occurrences was the presence of un-\nremembered spatial texture, especially the location of everyday appliances. We realized\nthe potential for the exercise to exist less as a documentation of space, and more as a tool\nfor creating or allowing for new awareness: a container for remembered spaces.\n\nThe space we thought of generating is twofold: a small, holdable box or envelope which\ncontains a kit or a game including implements and directives for the exercise, and a the\nresulting psychic space between people and their memories and communal space between\nthe multiple participants. We endeavored to create new ongoing spaces by encouraging\nothers to do the exercise enclosed in the tiny, discrete space of the kit.\n\nWe produced a few runs of this tool as a kit to distribute. The kit includes a short list of\ndirections, a pencil and eraser, a piece of paper to draw on and 'memory stimulating'\nquestion cards. The questions were generated through our discussions of our own\nexperiences doing the exercise. We conducted interviews with participants to document\nfurther observations. Finally, we had a group gathering to consciously hold the space that\nthe kit had generated.\n\nHome of Memory/ Memory of Home... Homember It\nA Container for Remembered Space\n\nGroup Members:\nNajiyah Edun, MArch I\nCharlie Byrd Hagen-Cazes, MArch I\nKate James, SMVisS I\nMorgan Pinney, MArch I\nJohn Pugh, MArch I\n\nIn our exploration of remembered spaces, we looked at several key texts. Most integral\nto our theoretical framework was Bachalard's Poetics of Space, in which he discusses the\nprocess of remembering spaces in terms of poetics rather than factual re-assembly:\n\"Memories of the outside world will never have the same tonality as those of home and,\nby recalling these memories, we add to our store of dreams; we are never real historians,\nbut always near poets, and our emotion is perhaps nothing but an expression of a poetry\nthat was lost.\" (87) We found in our process and feedback that this was very much the\ncase--the process of remembering space is a flexible, creative process, with primary\nimportance being not on accuracy but on engagement with past spatial narratives.\n\nOf course, spatial narratives are particularly poignant when they involved our living\nspace; the home stage is one of layers of history and transformation, and its space will\nframe our spatial experiences for life. \"When we dream of the house we were born in, in\nthe utmost depths of revery, we participate in this original warmth, in this well-tempered\nmatter of the material paradise\" (Bachalard, 88).\n\nThe importance of the early home space was rediscovered by many of our participants,\nand many discussed the use of processional and event-based narratives as the method of\nrecall. As Mark Rakatansky argues in Spatial Narratives, the experience of space is\nalways framed in the temporal scale, and always involves sequence. \"On the one hand,\nall so-called processional architecture operates in a much more complex and\nindeterminate ways than is generally assumed, and on the other hand, all architecture is\nprocessional (in other words, cannot be non-processional).\"\n\nFinally, in choosing the form that our project would take, we thought of the highly\npersonal, intense project of the individual remembering personal spaces, and how this\neffort could accumulate to form some collective memory 'space.' \"While it is individuals\nthemselves who partake in the actual physiological process of remembering, it is the\nsocial cohort through which memory endures and derives its strength\" (Barandon, 9).\nTherefore, in designing our kit, we felt it was important to connect participants, to have\nsome discussion about the shared experience of recollection. In this process, it became\neven more clear, to reiterate Bachalard's key point, that the impact of the exercise of\nremembering, collective or individual, is derived from its process, and the implied\ncontinuation of this process, rather than in the specific detail of the memory itself."

      "content": "Reach Out and Map Someone\n\nGroup 4:\n\nAnnatina Caprez, SMVisS, Year One\nHaruka Horiuchi, MArch, Level I\nMarika Kobel, MArch, Level I\nSteve Preston, MArch, Level I\n\nProject Description\n\nReach Out and Map Someone examines the nature of space through the perspective of individuals who\nparticipated in the project. The purpose of this undertaking is to manually map ideas of space through\nimages, texts and sound recordings. In this age of increasing dependence on digital media, particular\nfor interactions (i.e. email and the web), we wanted to reinforce the idea of direct human contact and\ninterpersonal connections that specifically reject digital technology. We used cameras, notebooks and\naudio recorders as devices for gaining information. We used our group as a base point for handing off,\nsending or randomly approaching friends, peers, or strangers to collect a wide demographic of\nindividuals in respect to age, occupation, location and mindset. The method was not intended to be\nscientific in its scope but rather to reveal and explore the organic nature of human interaction and\nencourage the development of new relationships. We were able to map the wide geographical range of\nthe participants through these devices, and more importantly, attempted to understand the broader\ninterpretations of space and the parallels between the information and ideas recorded.\n\nThe goal of this project was to encourage interactions between different individuals in an effort to\nreveal commonalities in perceptions of space. Not only were we trying to map people's ideas of space\nbut to actually visualize these spaces and create a sensory experience from the collected data. How\nare people in different parts of the world connected by ideas about public and private spaces and the\nconcepts of comfort and discomfort? Do these ideas change based on the nature of the environment in\nwhich the individual operates-private versus public space, home versus work, geographic location, and\nthe general qualities of their everyday lives. Does the method of material distribution and levels of\npersonal intimacy affect how candid people are about the spaces around them? The collection of the\nvarious materials allows us to visualize or 'map' conceptual connections by these spatial interactions\nand ideas.\n\nCritique of Everyday Life Henri Lefebvre\n\nLefebvre is concerned with human interaction on a micro and macro scale and how those relationships\ndetermine social behavioral patterns. In his words, \"the 'macro' does not determine the 'micro'. It\nencompasses it; it controls it; it penetrates it and imposes regulations upon it, which are themselves at\ndiffering levels of depth and effectiveness: norms of conduct and behavior patterns, models and roles.\"\nThis introduces some interesting concepts to the fundamental goals of the project and how our results\nshould be analyzed. Our project works on a microsociological level and attemps to map the\nmacroscopic implications of the connections made during the process. Based on Lefebvre's hypothesis,\nour analysis must question the authenticity of the so called \"unmediated relationships,\" interactions\nthat occur directly between people. The intimacy between individuals as well as the social hierarchy in\nplace may affect the nature of our results in terms of what people are willing to share or how they\npresent their ideas or surroundings. There is a need to contextualize the results in terms of the various\ncomponents of everyday life as perceived by the individuals and the surrounding environment.\n\nFurthermore, Lefebvre attempts to 'relativize the concept' of alienation in terms of its connection to a\nsocial framework. An awareness or feeling of alienation is, in effect, disalienating and connects the\nindividual to a defined social situation, but does not necessarily prevent further alientations from the\nsocial collectivity. By using instructional prompts to determine different individuals' ideas about\nprivate spaces, we can determine definite patterns or overlapping perceptions of what constitutes\n'private' or 'solitude.'\n\nProject Process and Results\n\nAs a start, each group member sent out four cameras and four notebooks to a variety of family,\nfriends, peers or strangers. Roughly half were distributed locally and the others were sent much further\ngeographically. Each camera or notebook had a set of rules attached with instructions and prompts to\ncomplete the task. The idea was that each item was completed by one person and then passed on to\nanother until completion. Each of the four notebooks and cameras had a different set of prompts to\nencourage a broad range of data. Some cameras and notebooks also asked the participants to record\ntheir name, location and occupation. Some also asked that a picture be taken of the individual\nparticipants. The goal was to create a set of prompts that would possibly affect the participant's level\nof comfort with the candor of their submission, i.e. who would be seeing their written text or\nphotographs. For instance, a camera might ask the participant to take a picture of your favorite public\nplace that you experience on an everyday basis and your favorite private place that you experience on\na daily basis; or it may ask that you photograph a place that you spend a lot of time in and then to pass\nthe camera to someone that you wouldn't normally have a conversation with, specifically someone who\ndoes not share that space. A notebook might ask you to write about a place that you feel most at home\nand about a place that makes you feel uncomfortable; or to write about a place that others generally\ndon't know you spend time in. Based on an initial test and set of results, we found that we needed to\nincrease our distribution to ensure retrieval of materials and also to refine the rules. Some subsequent\ncameras involved not only taking two photographs, but writing about why they chose their subjects. Or\nthe prompts became more specific about who they hand off their material to.\n\nSome of the challenges that we experienced in the process included:\n- getting willing random participants\n- full candor\n- general spatial awareness of individuals\n- time constraints and travel of the items\n- articulating rule sets to get intended results without constraining or limiting responses\n\nResults / Findings\n\nThe process of 'reaching out' to family, friends, and even random strangers reveals existing networks\nand bonds between people. The way the participants chose the next participants reveals the\nmicrosociological network in place for that particular group. Analyzing the images and texts within this\ncontext allows us to draw macrosociological conclusions about social hierarchies, structures or\ninstitutions. The mapped movement of a given camera or notebook shows the strength or extents of a\ngiven social circle. For instance, a camera may have moved only within a family unit or a group of\npeers, demonstrating the concept of the unmediated 'blood ties.'\n\nComparing the images and text to the initial rules or prompts allows us to either form patterns of\nperceptions of space or acknowledge anomalies. Even across the wide range of participants, we can\nfind commonalities that link seemingly divergent groups of people. For instance, a recurring favorite\nprivate place was the bedroom, while a favorite comfortable place was a spot in the home. These\nfindings begin to create a social commentary of how people operate in their daily lives and feel about\ntheir surroundings. However, what we found was that by disregarding digital technology, it became\nclear that the microsociological networks in place define social interactions in a way that does not\nnecessarily encourage the idea of \"reaching out.\" Requiring passing of materials from one person to\nanother mapped existing connections between people, even if geographically far reaching. It was much\nharder for us to create new connections between participants, but rather took the role of archivists. It\nalso should be noted that the process is still ongoing and that materials will continue to arrive even\nafter the presentation and the participants' interest in the results remains to be seen."
