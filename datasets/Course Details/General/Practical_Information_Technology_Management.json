  "syllabus_content": "Course Meeting Times\n\nLectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session\n\nCourse Purpose and Content\n\nThe purpose of the course is to provide frameworks, tools and skill and comfort in the understanding and use of IT in business from the point of view of a business manager, an IT manager and an employee like a new graduate from MIT.\n\nThe objectives and content areas are:\n\nTo understand and be able to use frameworks and tools relating to the strategic and operational use of IT in business. Topics include, for example, alignment of business strategy with the role and strategy for IT investments, digitization and transformation of business and organizational capability, design and implementation of IT architecture and IT governance, business process management, and supply and outsourcing relationships.\n\nTo instill skills and comfort in decision making around IT project management. Topics include the lifecycle of a project from initial need and justification through selection or development to installation and integration with existing systems to deployment and organizational changes necessary to get business value.\n\nTo cover the necessary basic concepts of business management in relation to IT. The business side includes business strategy and its execution, alternative forms of organizational structure, business processes, and business functions (particularly understanding the rudiments of financial statements).\n\nGrading\n\nACTIVITIES\n\nPERCENTAGES\n\nClass Discussion (Especially Case Discussion)\n\n35%\n\nThree Short Papers\n\n30%\n\nProject Team Presentations and Paper\n\n35%\n\nPreparation and Class\n\nThe course is heavily case-and discussion-oriented. A business case study will typically be assigned, as well as one or more articles or chapters, for about half the classes, and a visitor will follow in the next who was either in the case or is an expert on the topic of the case. Rigorous preparation of cases and active participation in discussions is expected.\n\nEach short paper will be based on the material and discussion in the class at the end of a module, and are to represent the student's extension of the case and topic. Papers will be in the form of a memorandum to an executive in the case or to a class visitor, and are to be no more than two pages in length.\n\nThe written take-home final exam will be based on a class near the end of the course.\n\nStudent teams will be formed early in the course. Teams are for the team project, and also to meet weekly on their own schedule to discuss the assigned case and articles as part of their preparation for the upcoming class.\n\nThe team project presentations will be based on projects assigned early in the course from opportunities generated by the professor and the TA. After the presentation the team will submit a written report, no more than 20 pages in length, based on the presentation and discussion of it.\n\nAbsences and Other Academic Standards\n\nStudents will be allowed three absences during the semester. Each absence must notify the TA in advance, unless an emergency. At the beginning of the class following the absence, a written analysis of the material assigned for the missed class is due. Absences beyond three will generally affect the grade in the course.",

Create two columns to do this: one headed \"Reengineering\" and the other\n\"Area I Change \" and be prepared to discuss the differences row by row.\n\nb) Apply the change management assessment. What is your assessment of the\nrisk, or likelihood of successful business change? What mitigation should be\nundertaken, if any, before the change is executed? What project management\napproach does White and his managers appear to be using? Is it the appropriate\none here?\n\n2. Read the (B-1) case. Go back and do the above two exercises more carefully, now in\nretrospect that you have more data of the context and know what happened after the\nchanges were introduced.

Founded in\nMassachusetts in August 1979 by Richard Egan and Roger Marino (the \"E\" and \"M\" in\nEMC), EMC has grown into one of the fastest-growing and most successful major\ninformation technology providers in the world.\nEMC Corporation is the world leader in products, services, and solutions for\ninformation storage and management. Its solutions and services help organizations\nof all sizes and across the globe better and more cost-effectively manage, protect,\nand share their information. EMC's 2004 lineup of tiered storage platforms\nrepresents the industry's broadest offering, at prices spanning $10,000 to $2.5\nmillion. EMC's vision is to create the ultimate information lifecycle management\ncompany--to help its customers get the maximum value from their information at\nthe lowest total cost, at every point in the information lifecycle.\nEMC customers include the world's largest banks and financial services firms,\nInternet service providers, manufacturers, healthcare institutions, life sciences\norganizations, telecommunications providers, airlines, transportation companies,\neducational institutions, regional and national government agencies. EMC finished\n2003 with total consolidated revenues of $6.24 billion, up from $5.44 billion the year\nbefore. Net income for the year was $496 million or $0.22 per diluted share. The\nbalance sheet, already strong at the beginning of the year, grew even stronger. Cash\nand investments grew to $6.9 billion at year end, up from $5.7 billion the year\nbefore--even after the company spent $127 million to buy back 11.5 million shares\nof EMC stock.\n\nEMC employs more than 7,000 employees in its home state of Massachusetts and\nmore than 21,000 employees in more than 50 countries worldwide. Since 1998, EMC\nhas acquired 15 companies."

      "content": "Preparing for Case Discussion1\n\nIn preparing for class, we recommend that you read the case three times. The first reading should\nbe a quick run-through of the text in the case. It should give you a feeling for what the case is\nabout and the types of data it contains. Your second reading should be in more depth. Many\npeople like to underline or mark up their cases to pick out important points they know will be\nneeded later. Your major effort on a second reading should be to understand the decision\nproblem and context. For example, analyze the case with respect to customer behavior and\ntrends, competitor's behavior and trends, and the firm's strengths and weaknesses.\n\nOn your second reading, carefully examine the exhibits in the case. Usually the case writer has\nput the exhibits there for a purpose, although some exhibits will be superfluous and some may\neven be inconsistent -- just as real data are. But mostly, the exhibits contain information that will\nbe useful in analyzing the situation. You will often find that you will need to apply an analytical\ntechnique to an exhibit in order to benefit from the information in the raw data. Averages, ratios,\nbreak-even analyses, and comparisons with other exhibits are often helpful.\n\nOn the third reading you should have a good idea of the fundamentals of the case. Now you will\nbe searching to understand the specific decision problem. Part of the case analysis process, as in\nreal life, is identifying the real decision problem amidst lots of data and information. It is your task\nto figure out what decision(s) must be made (if a decision needs to be made at all), make action\nrecommendations, and consider how you would specifically implement your recommendation.\n\nSometimes you will get thinking questions about the cases (posted on the class web-site). Before\nthe third reading you may want to review these questions to stimulate your thinking and highlight\nissues that you should have a working knowledge of before the class discussion. These\nquestions are not necessarily \"tips for a successful case solution,\" but rather are meant to insure\nthat everyone understands the basics of the case and the discussion can begin \"on the same\npage.\"\n\nDuring the class discussion, you should be prepared to share your thoughts on the real problems\nand issues of the case and present a persuasive summary of your recommendations. Be\nprepared to explain why you rejected any obvious alternative courses of action and provide vital\nfacts supporting acceptance of your recommendation. Your goal is to convince the class that your\nrecommendation is the best. However, a rigorous approach will consider both sides to every\nrecommendation. You should be up-front about potential problems you might expect in\nimplementing your recommendation.\n\nFinally, an important concern in any discipline is the ethics of its practitioners. This is certainly\ntrue in marketing and advertising. Ethical issues will arise in the case discussions and lecture\ndiscussions. Indeed, some managers in the cases act in ways your might not consider ethical\n(and in some situations these actions are mentioned in the case specifically to raise ethical\nissues). We encourage you to address these issues in class discussion.\n\n1 Dan Ariely & Michael Norton, \"Syllabus for 15.840 - Marketing Management, Spring 2004\""

The\nindividual packages should be distributed to students as they arrive on campus in the fall. We\nfeel that this type of a trial would minimize the network impact of VoIP while allowing you to\ncollect data about which type of system and features will be most useful. If there is any way we\ncan assist in this deployment either in a PR capacity or as student representatives, we would\nwelcome the opportunity.

One such technology is voice over IP which uses the internet to place phone calls.\nAs a world leader in science and technology it has been suggested that MIT should begin to\nimplement these new devices.\n\nProject Summary:\nProject Randomize was initiated to investigate possible motivations for using VoIP at MIT as\nwell as to evaluate installations at other schools and gauge student and administration interest.\nDuring our investigation we spoke to various administrators in IS&T as well as surveyed\nundergraduate students about their phone use. Based on the responses we received, we are able\nto make a recommendation for further study of the subject of VoIP at MIT in the form of a pilot\ntargeted at students. In his capacity as Undergraduate Association President, John Cloutier will\nbe assisting Allison Dolan the Director of Telephony and Shared Serviced for IS&T to finalize\nthe details for the pilot over the summer for deployment during the first few weeks of the fall\nterm.\n\nThe pilot will serve to explore the different types of VoIP phones and features available while\nminimizing the effect on MIT's existing network infrastructure. Marketing this pilot to\nundergraduates will help IS&T address the recent additional phone charges that have been\nmandated by providing an alternative for students who can't afford the fee. This topic has\nalready received a lot of attention in The Tech student newspaper which recently ran a story\ndescribing our recommended pilot to undergraduates (See Appendix G).\n\nThe other recommendation we are making is to ensure efforts are made to improve\ncommunication between the various groups involved. Network and telephony departments must\nwork together for this hybrid technology installation to proceed. Without this cooperation, we\nfeel VoIP cannot go further at MIT.\n\nScope:\nThe technology itself was not a primary focus of our investigation as this type of study would not\nadd value to the project for IS&T. Cost was not considered either as IS&T is already in the best\nposition to evaluate the expense of such a program. Rather we took the approach of an objective\nthird party gathering information to help IS&T make the best decision about how to dive into\nVoIP.\n\nProject Evaluation:\nAlthough Project Randomize was hindered by the loss a group member and difficulty contacting\nIT resources at other schools (and here at MIT), the final analysis has proven to be quite\nvaluable. The insight we were able to provide to IS&T will likely result in a 100 student pilot\ndeployment in the fall. Although Jennifer will be graduating, John will continue to work with\nAllison on bringing VoIP to MIT.\n\nPage 4 of 47\n\nProject Randomize: VoIP Pilot Implementation at MIT\nPROJECT SCOPE AND METHODOLOGY\nThe primary goal of this project is to collect information from various sources in order to provide\nIS&T with some insight into what the MIT community wants and how other schools have\naddressed the same issues.\n\nWITHIN SCOPE\nOther Schools:\nWe did phone interviews with several network administrators at the University of North Carolina\nand Dartmouth. They provided us with a description of their current status and future plans for\nVoIP. They were also able to share with us some of the road blocks they faced when installing\nVoIP and gave their perspective on the human impact of this new technology.\n\nMIT:\nOur data collection at MIT took two forms. First, we interviewed several people from IS&T\nwith different areas of expertise (networks, telephony, VoIP) to gauge the current status of\nnetwork infrastructure, VoIP deployments and departmental interest and interactions. Second,\nwe distributed a student survey which addressed general telephone usage as well as interest in\nVoIP. This survey was designed to gauge student reactions to IS&T's new $17/month phone fee\nto be implemented in Fall 2005. Over 75 responses were received and tabulated.\n\nThe final recommendation includes an analysis of these data along with several 'next steps' for\nfurther action. Central to the project was evaluating existing network infrastructure and upgrade\nplans in order to determine what kind of pilot would be feasible. Along with the technological\nrequirements we looked at departmental interaction and processes for campus computing that\nmight affect the success of VoIP.\n\nNOT CONSIDERED\nSeveral aspects of a VoIP installation were not considered in the project because our team would\nnot have been able to provide any additional insight IS&T does not already have. Both network\nand telephony groups have already done investigations of the technology available for VoIP. In\neach case, they have been in contact with manufacturers who sell the needed hardware and are\nvery knowledgeable about how VoIP works both theoretically and in practice. For this reason\nwe did not look to investigate the actual technology nor did we consider cost as an issue. IS&T\nis much better suited to make decisions about what to spend and for which products.\n\nPage 5 of 47\n\nProject Randomize: VoIP Pilot Implementation at MIT\nFINDINGS\nDARTMOUTH\nOur telephone interview with Larry Levine at Dartmouth University gave us a first hand\nexperience with VoIP which was used to make the call. Dartmouth recently underwent a major\nupgrade to its telephone and data systems. The analog telephone switch they had been using\nreached the end of its life span which gave them the opportunity to replace it with a VoIP\nproduct. Dartmouth elected to provide brand new VoIP telephones to every staff member at the\nexpense of the IT department. One of the main drawbacks to these types of phones is that they\nare quite expensive so departments aren't eager to invest in replacing all their old handsets.\n\nIn order to make this installation possible, Dartmouth had to do a major upgrade to its data\nnetwork infrastructure. They increased bandwidth to slower areas and added uninterruptible\npower supplies to ensure the network stayed up even during a power outage.\n\nIn addition to network upgrades, Dartmouth also realized the importance of calculating the\nhuman impact VoIP would have on users. They found that in many cases, increasing the number\nof available features was detrimental because it confused users by giving them too much to learn\nand too many options from which to choose. Training staff to use the new phone system was not\na trivial issue. Many users at Dartmouth were used to doing things a certain way and had\ndifficulty transitioning to the new technology. Even if VoIP phones allowed people to check\ntheir voice mail with a single button, if people were used to dialing a string of digits to call a VM\noperator, the new method would cause more frustration during the learning process.\n\nThe VoIP implementation for Dartmouth students is somewhat different. Unlike MIT,\nDartmouth does not provide telephones in student housing and could not expect students to buy\nexpensive VoIP phones with their own money. Instead they installed phone switches that were\nintegrated to the campus wide VoIP network on one side and allowed users to attach regular\nanalog phones on their side. This part of the project is therefore invisible to end users.\n\nUNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA\nWe also spoke with James Oberlin and Tyler Johnson from the University of North Carolina\nabout what they are doing with VoIP. Unlike the Dartmouth project, UNC has chosen to deploy\nVoIP to individual buildings and departments as a complete telephony solution. The first was\nWUNC, the campus radio station and the next will be two new IT buildings which are currently\nunder construction.\n\nThe motivation for UNC's pilots was not a business one but rather meant to enable academic\ncollaboration and to further investigate the technology. They stressed the issue that conventional\ncircuit based telephony business models do not work for VoIP. As a result, they are not\nattempting to sell VoIP as a solution to cut departmental expenses, but rather to explore new\npossibilities in communication technology.\n\nAnother aspect of VoIP that is being considered is wireless and cellular phones. The idea is that\nno one would want to have a phone that is hardwired to their office phone jack if they could use\na wireless phone much like their 802.11b laptop or PDA. However for this to work, wireless\ncoverage on campus would need to be much more robust. People would not accept a phone that\nPage 6 of 47\n\nProject Randomize: VoIP Pilot Implementation at MIT\ncould only be used indoors for example. For this reason, wireless VoIP at UNC is still years\naway.\n\nMIT ADMINISTRATORS\n\nJeff Schiller - Network Manager\nWe spoke with Jeff Schiller to get an idea of the existing network topography and plans for\nfuture upgrades. VoIP requires a more robust network than other types of data traffic, so\nensuring a quality network is in place is of primary importance. According to Jeff, much of\nMIT's network is too old to handle VoIP. However, whenever buildings are constructed or\nrenovations completed, the new network that is installed should be sufficient to handle voice\ntraffic. However, there are several other important factors to consider in this process.\n\nThe Department of Facilities and IS&T don't always agree on the best ways to deploy a network\ninstallation or upgrade. In the past, funding would flow at the discretion of Facilities and often\nwould not be enough for IS&T to fund a strong enough network. While this funding problem\nseems to have been addressed by taking network allocations away from Facilities, other\ndifficulties such as agreeing on the size and location of data closets still exist.\n\nThe telephony staff and network staff come from very different backgrounds. The circuit based\ntelephone model is based on providing a metered service. In other words, people are charged\nbased on how much they use the service. Contrasted with that is the internet model which\nprovides relatively inexpensive (often free) transmission of an unlimited amount of data. Analog\nphone networks also have a huge amount of sunk infrastructure that makes adapting to new\ntechnology more difficult and time consuming. IP network on the other hand are always rapidly\nchanging and growing in what might be considered by telephonists to be a very unstable\nenvironment. Standards that exist today might be ancient history in a few years.\n\nFigure 1\n\nFigure 2\n\nThese differences have even influenced how hardware for VoIP systems is designed. Lucent\nmakes VoIP products from the perspective of and with experience in telephone systems whereas\nCisco takes an IP network approach to its designs. These differences can lead the two groups to\nselecting different ways to solve the same problem. Since VoIP is very much a hybrid\ntechnology, they will be forced to work together in order to implement any pilot project.\n\nPage 7 of 47\n\nProject Randomize: VoIP Pilot Implementation at MIT\nThe final issue that Jeff raised was that VoIP is still a techie toy and is not yet marketable to\ndepartments as a communication solution. Once the technology and standards develop a bit\nmore and a workable business model can be created, VoIP will become a legitimate alternative to\nanalog telephony.\n\nMIT STUDENTS\nThe 20 question survey produced a great deal of information about student reactions to the\n$17/month phone plan, their cell phone to dorm phone usage and feelings towards VoIP\ntechnology. List below are several of the main findings from the data. The complete list of\nfindings can be found in Appendix A: MIT Student Survey Data.\n\nProfile of Surveyed Students\nThere were 75 student responses, of which 27 male, 47 female and 1 transgender. The class\ndistribution was pretty even with 17% Class of 2005; 27% Class of 2006; 25% Class of 2007;\n29% Class of 2008; 2% Graduate Students. All the undergraduate dorms except Senior Haus\nwere surveyed. Apparently, the e-mail survey was never forwarded to Senior Haus. The one\ngraduate student response lived in Tang.\n\nPercentage of Cell Phone Users\nThe myth that everyone has a cell phone is partially true. 79% of the surveyed students owned\ncell phones while 21% did not.\n\nDormitory Phone Use\nAs shown in Figure 3, an equal portion of students use their dormitory phones for either 0% or\n100% of their phone calls. The majorityof those surveyed students use their dormitory phones\nfor less than 50% of their calls however, an interesting point is that there is a small, core group\nof students who rely mostly on their dorm phones. They spend about 60% to 100% of their calls\non dorm phones.\n\nFigure 3\nDormitory Phone Use\n0.1\n% of phone use spent on Dorm phone\nNumber of People\n\nPage 8 of 47\n\nProject Randomize: VoIP Pilot Implementation at MIT\nReactions to $17/month fee\nOur results found three main types of reactions to the $17/month phone plan fee: Indifferent,\nOutraged and Understanding.\n\nThe Indifferent group, 70% of the respondents, had a range in emotion from anger to frustration,\nbut in the end were unaffected by the $17/month fee. The Indifferent were typically heavy cell\nphone users that were unfazed by the elimination of the current dormitory phone privileges.\nThey could continue using their cell phones as is or upgrade their cell phone plans to incorporate\nmore minutes. One person even commented that it would be less expensive to pay overage\ncharges each month than to pay this $17/month fee. Those who did not own cell phones felt that\npurchasing a calling card would meet their minimal phone use.\n\nThe Outraged group, 23% of the respondents, was extremely affected by the $17/month fee. The\nOutraged individuals did not own cell phones, couldn't afford cell phones or didn't use the phone\nenough to pay $17/month for dormitory phone use. Many of these individuals use the current\nMIT dormitory phone service to receive phone calls from their parents. We found that these\nindividuals tended to live in the Massachusetts area and therefore were able to use the 617 area\ncode to their advantage. Several students commented that phone service was a basic necessity\nthat other universities offered and were appalled at the fact it would be taken away.\n\nThe Understanding group, 7% of the respondents, felt this was a practical decision by the IS&T\ndepartment. These students understood that very few students use their dorm phones anymore\nand that it would provide cost savings for MIT.\n\nPurchase the Plan?\nOf the students surveyed,16% said they would purchase the new phone plan. These students\ncommented on how they felt forced to purchase the plan because they no other choice. The 79%\nthat said they would not purchase the plan felt they didn't need their dorm phone, the service was\ntoo expensive or they couldn't afford it. The 5% of the students who were still deciding were\ntrying to determine if they should just upgrade their cell phone, buy a cell phone, get a calling\ncard or just buy the service. Basically there were no students who were enthusiastic about the\n$17/month phone plan.\n\nFeelings towards VoIP Technology\nThe second half of the survey listed various qualities about VoIP technology and how it would\naffect the students' lives. The survey explained qualities such as how voicemails could be saved\nas audio files or how phone calls could be made from laptops. The students were also allowed to\nrate how \"cool\" the feature was and how much value it added to their lives. Overall there was\napathy and indifference to the features of VoIP technology. None of the listed features had a\nstatistically significant approval of any feature.\n\nThis unenthusiastic attitude for VoIP may be attributed to the students' lack of knowledge for\nVoIP technology. They do not realize VoIP's benefits and ease of use. Furthermore, students\nrequire and expect very little from their phone service. The variety of services offered by VoIP\nis not as enticing as if presented to a business person or technology guru. Students are satisfied\nwith their cell phone service because they only need the ability to call their family and friends.\n\nPage 9 of 47\n\nProject Randomize: VoIP Pilot Implementation at MIT\nTelemarketers\nSurprisingly, telemarketers are a huge nuisance to students across the campus. They call\nstudents in the early morning and early evening. One student respondent said he like the new\nproposed phone plan because it eliminated the ability to receive incoming non-MIT calls. On the\nother hand, students were frustrated because paying for the $17/month fee would be equivalent\nto paying to receive telemarketer calls.\n\nProblems with Current Dorm Phone Service\nThere were also a number of complaints about the current MIT dormitory phone service. One\nstudent from MacGregor does not have a telephone jack in his room . This same student, as well\nas a student from New House, didn't have their proper dormitory phone number listed in the\nMIT directory. When people tried to call them, the phone of the person down the hall would\nring. There were also issues in New House where one student's dorm phone didn't work for\nseveral months. Now she doesn't even have her dorm phone plugged in.\n\nPage 10 of 47\n\nProject Randomize: VoIP Pilot Implementation at MIT\nANALYSIS AND CONCLUSIONS\nSCALE OF PILOT\nLarge Implementation\nIt is unlikely that a large scale VoIP implementation could be completed in the near future. This\nrefers to both installing VoIP as the primary voice communication solution in an entire building\nor department as well as replacing the legacy voice switch with a VoIP capable switch. Much of\nMIT's existing network infrastructure is not robust enough to handle the needs of VoIP.\nAlthough they are slowly being upgraded, the costs involved in speeding up these repairs\ncombined with those of staff transition far outweigh any benefit VoIP might provide to interested\ndepartments.\n\nIt is similarly not reasonable to discard the 5E only a few years into its decade long life span.\nDartmouth was able to take advantage of the fact that its legacy switch was end the end of its\ndepreciation to replace it with a VoIP switch. MIT should maintain its current process for\nupgrading the phone system and begin planning a replacement two years prior to the 5E's demise\nin 2009. In the time between now and then, every effort should be made to investigate the kind\nof VoIP features that could be integrated into the new phone system in 2011.\n\nSmall Implementation\nDuring this period of further study, a small pilot should be undertaken to explore the types of\nphones and features that might be of value to MIT in the future. To help address the issue of the\n$17 per month dorm phone charge, this pilot could be deployed to students who would otherwise\nhave difficulty affording phone service. The non-mission critical nature of residential voice\nservice as compared to administration voice service is another benefit of a student program. It is\nalso vital that this program have only a minimal impact on existing network infrastructure and\nnot require any type of construction or upgrades to be done. For this reason, commercially\navailable 'VoIP in a box' solutions would work best.\n\nCULTURAL DIFFERENCES\nIt has become quite clear during the course of our investigation that telephone and IP networks\nare quite different. One is not inherently better or worse than the other (contrary to what some\nmight want us to think), but these differences become important when the hybrid technology of\nVoIP requires the two to be joined. Phones are circuit (one to one) based, IP networks are packet\nbased (one to many). Phone use is metered, internet use is unlimited. The two work in different\nways and break in different ways. These differences must be taken into account when choosing\na VoIP solution so that phone service and network functionality are both protected.\n\nDEPARTMENTAL COOPERATION\nIn much the same way as the two types of service fundamentally differ, often it can seem that the\ntwo departments within IS&T are coming from different places. If something goes wrong, the\ntwo groups will approach a solution from very different points of view. This could become an\nobstacle for collaboration, but should instead be though of as an opportunity to gather several\ndifferent perspectives in order to find the best overall solution.\n\nPage 11 of 47\n\nProject Randomize: VoIP Pilot Implementation at MIT\n\nSome of the issues with Facilities/IS&T cooperation have been addressed and so too must be the\ninternal IS&T feelings. Everything from the planning of the new system to choosing hardware to\nadministrating a joint telephony/network project must be approached as a collaboration. Only\nwhen this is achieved will VoIP at MIT be possible.\n\nPage 12 of 47\n\nProject Randomize: VoIP Pilot Implementation at MIT\nRECOMMENDATIONS AND NEXT STEPS\n\nVOIP PILOT IN STUDENT DORMITORIES\nImplementing a VoIP pilot in student dormitories in Fall 2005 will be the most feasible and\neffective thing solution in addressing this $17/month phone plan issue. It is to the benefit of the\nMIT administration to extend a possible alternative to the fee. If students feel the administration\nis cold heartedly implementing initiatives and taking away services, there will be tension\nbetween the two. This VoIP pilot will allow students see that the administration is working with\nstudents.\n\nTest Multiple Technologies\nIt is recommended that IS&T utilizes the commercial VoIP products out in the market. The\ntelephony department can deploy the three types of VoIP phone technologies: analog phone with\ntelephony adaptor, VoIP phone and soft phone. Distribute the phones randomly to students and\nsurvey their satisfaction with the technology.\n\nPilot Participants\nIS&T can extend the survey to any type of MIT student. It can be limited to only undergraduates\nin undergraduate dorms, undergraduates in any dorm or graduate students in dormitories. The\nselection of the participant pool should not produce any radically different results. However we\nrecommend working with the undergraduate population since you have the direct assistance of\nthe incoming UA president, John Cloutier.\n\nTime Period\nThe ideal time period to target students is Orientation and the first week of classes. Students\ntend to become busier and less responsive to surveys as the semester progresses. Therefore, it\nwould be wise to distribute the follow-up survey either in the middle of the semester or the\nbeginning of the spring semester.\n\nAdvertising & Publicity\nIt is most effective to advertise to students through e-mails and The Tech. Send quick and\ninformative e-mails to students through their dormitory e-mail lists. Many dorms have a more\nofficial e-mailing list as well as an informal e-mailing list. Send your pilot advertisements\nthrough the former to receive a better response. Call the Tech to get another article written about\nthe pilot. A front page headline is more effective than any Tech advertisement, poster or spam.\nSeveral articles have been written about the phone charge issue and on May 10, 2005 The Tech\nran a story about this project and our recommended pilot (See Appendix G).\n\nAnother way to get information about the VoIP pilot is to arrange an information booth in the\nStudent Center. This booth could even be a central location for equipment pick up, if you choose\nto have students install the equipment themselves. The Student Center has more traffic than\nLobby 10, which is another popular location for information booths.\n\nHelp Desk\nIn order to not bias the VoIP pilot, IS&T needs to create a convenient and accessible \"help\ndesk.\" This \"help desk\" should be available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to answer VoIP\nPage 13 of 47\n\nProject Randomize: VoIP Pilot Implementation at MIT\nphone problems. IS&T will not want the pilot survey results to be filled with complaints about\nunanswered questions. The pilot should try to simulate a well run VoIP system.\n\nContact Persons\nWork with the Undergraduate Association, Graduate Student Council and dormitory house\nmanagers to effectively execute this pilot. These three groups have the most power and contact\nwith the potential pilot participants. Refer to the following links for contact information for each\ngroup.\n\n\"OUTRAGED\" STUDENTS\nProject Randomize obtained preliminary information about the various student responses. We\nstrongly recommend IS&T or next semester's 15.568 class to further investigate this \"outraged\"\ngroup. Many of these students are international or local Massachusetts students. Determine this\ngroup's actual phone use to see if VoIP technology or a revised phone plan is the best solution.\nMost students are indifferent or unaffected by the $17/month plan so it is important to make sure\nIS&T is not ignoring these \"outraged\" students' needs.\n\nADMINISTRATION INTEREST IN VOIP\nThe project's findings discovered that students were not too impressed by the technological\nadvantages of VoIP technology, but the administration might have a more positive reaction.\nCurrently, Dennis Baron of the IS&T department has been introducing VoIP technology to a\nhandful of professors who find it very intriguing and useful. IS&T could deploy a pilot among\nthe administrators and professors to determine their level of interest. Even if this pilot doesn't\nspawn an immediate implementation, it can serve as a gateway for educating the administration\nand faculty about VoIP until MIT is ready to fully implement in 2011.\n\nPage 14 of 47\n\nProject Randomize: VoIP Pilot Implementation at MIT\nSUMMARY MESSAGE AND OBSERVATIONS\nProject Randomize has taught us many valuable lessons about IT project management and\ndealing with real world complications.\n\nPlan for Uncertainty\nOur team definitely learned the difficulties uncertainty can bring to a project. First we had to\ndeal with being the smallest group, with only three people. Then Jose Barraza's unexpected\nmedical leave led to a drastic re-scoping of our project. In the midst of trying to catch up and\nmeet deliverable deadlines, John Cloutier was unexpectedly injured on a Spring Break trip to\nIreland. Throughout the project, we had to work around everyone's busy schedules, including\nJohn's UA Presidency campaign. We had more challenges than any of the other two groups\ncombined, but we were able to work well with each other and stay focused on the project.\nWe've learned that being a solid team is the most important aspect of a project.\n\nIt is always difficult to accept that a project is being hindered by unforeseen events. In the\nbeginning, we felt that this type of information gathering project didn't really have too many\nopportunities for unforeseen problems getting in the way. Since then we've seen that even\nseemingly simple projects like ours can be turned into chaos. The article Managing Project\nUncertainty: from variation to chaos stresses the importance of identifying foreseen\nuncertainties and creating a contingency plan. In retrospect, losing a member of a team is a\nforeseen circumstance; however temporarily losing a team member as a result of a Spring Break\ntrip is unforeseen. In one class discussion, after explaining our project's unforeseen\ncircumstances, Tyco CEO Dana Deasy stressed the importance of thinking of any possible\nunforeseen uncertainty for a project. After Project Randomize we will always follow his\nvaluable advice for future projects.\n\nProject Randomize was primarily an information gathering project. We didn't have a budget or\nany concrete system changes to implement. As such we were relying solely on help from other\npeople to learn about VoIP, computer infrastructure and programs at other schools. When our\ngroup had difficulties arranging the interviews with other universities, Professor Gibson offered\nto try to contact these individuals for us, seeing that a Professor would get more attention and\nrespect than an undergraduate student. This reinforced the importance of having a backup plan.\nOur original project proposal had listed going to Professor Gibson as a solution if we\nencountered problems. If we had not created or utilized our backup plan, we would have been at\na formidable roadblock.\n\nHuman Acceptance of Technology\nFrom our interview with Dartmouth, we learned that humans play a key role in the success of an\nIT project. Similar to the First National City Bank case where the employees actually revolted\nand sabotaged the new machinery the first day of the implementation, Dartmouth had\ncomplications as well. The VoIP phone users were used to the habits and operations of the\ntraditional phones. When the VoIP phones did not respond the way the users expected them to,\nthey became extremely frustrated with the new technology and complained. For example, the\nusers expected to have a dial tone when they picked up a VoIP phone, but their VoIP phones\nnaturally don't have dial tones. The Dartmouth Computing Services department had to address\nthese human issues before the culture accepted the technology.\n\nPage 15 of 47\n\nProject Randomize: VoIP Pilot Implementation at MIT\n\nThe module Implementation and Change: \"Technology is the least of our problems\" was very\nrelevant to our VoIP project because a huge hurdle is trying to convince and educate the MIT\nadministration and students about the benefits of this technology. Allison informed us that it is\nunclear where and how VoIP could be best implemented on campus. Similar to the First\nNational City Bank case, a successful implementation of VoIP would require converting a\nmassive group of people to a new technology.\n\nAnother way to expedite human acceptance of technology is to make technology easy, as\nmentioned in the Make It Simple article. If they implement VoIP technology, the IS&T\ndepartment needs to make sure it passes \"the mom test,\" which basically says that widely\naccepted technology should be so user friendly that even your grandmother could operate it.\nTechnology gurus get too wrapped up in the \"coolness\" of a technology and forget to win over\nthe mainstream crowd. Keeping technology simple is critical to a successful IT implementation.\n\nCooperation and Support from Departments\nIn our research we discovered the fundamental differences between telephony and network\nservices. VoIP technology requires the cooperation between these two groups because if\nsomething goes wrong, the two groups will approach a solution from very different points of\nview. This situation has taught us that cooperation between all groups involved in an IT project\nis crucial to success.\n\nIn the heated debate following the announcement of the $17/month phone plan, Allison warned\nus to tread carefully when speaking to administrators at MIT to not give them the wrong\nimpression of our project's motives or make them feel threatened. The concerns here were\nsimilar to those of the Administrative Data Project Case in which technological progress was\nhindered by a deeply ingrained school culture of very autonomous departments that didn't work\ntogether.

List any complaints you have about cell phone service here at MIT.\n\nResponse\nFrequency\nn/a\nNone\nGenerally good coverage\nBad reception\n\nOf the 55 bad reception complaints, the most problematic areas were\nInfinite corridor\nMany locations in MIT\nStudent center\nCement buildings\nClassrooms\nBottom floor of student center\nUnderground labs\nEastern end of infinite corridor\nMcCormick\nBuilding 68\nKresge Auditorium\n10-250\n\nOther comments:\n-\nFor such a technology-based campus, the cell phone reception is surprisingly poor, even when you're\noutdoors. Everywhere else in Boston is almost better.\n-\nI barely get reception on half of campus, and I get no reception on the other half. And I'm locked into the\ndeal with the cell phone company for another year, so I end up using my dorm phone a lot.\n-\nI guess I don't get reception everywhere, but it's no worse than anywhere outside MIT.\n-\nI LIVE IN SIMMONS AND RECEPTION SUCKS! You walk out in the hall, it goes away. in past years,\nif I moved in my chair I lost a phone call.\n-\nOverage charges are extremely high and reception isn't always great.\n-\nNone of my friends' phones get enough reception in my room and so I won't be able to call anyone from my\nroom even if I have a cell phone\n-\nSpotty in some buildings. Also cell phone service in general is not of the quality of a landline.\n-\nThere is bad reception in many dorms and most buildings on campus. Also, it is expensive\n-\nThere is very little signal in East Campus, near Bldgs 18, 56, 66, so in order to actually use my cellphone to\ncall home, which I do almost every day, I have to walk to the EC courtyard or walk on Mem Drive. I\nprefer to use my room phone to make most of my calls.\n-\nThere should be student discounts for Verizon and other cell phone services.\n-\nThey don't let you turn off service for a month.\n\nPage 24 of 47\n\nProject Randomize: VoIP Pilot Implementation at MIT\n\n6. List any complaints you have about dorm phone service here at MIT.\n\nResponse\nFrequency\nNone\nTelemarketers\n$17 fee\nNone, I don't use the phone\nNone, the service is good\n\nOther comments:\n-\n$17/month is more than I am willing to pay for just local service and incoming long distance, but\n$40/month is more than I am willing to pay for a cell phone. I see $10/month as about what I would pay for\nlocal phone. I also dislike rolling incoming long distance into the package to \"induce students to sign up,\"\nsince it feels like extortion -- I essentially *have* to sign up or buy a cell if my family wants to call me.\n-\nBad, I don't need it.\n-\nI do not have a working dorm telephone connection. I have a telephone, however no jack to plug it into. My\nphone number listed in the directory is actually the number of the person who lives in the next room over.\n-\nI don't know anything about it really, and I really wish I knew how everything worked out as far as what I\nmight need to do to be able to make long distance calls or receive voice mail, but I don't know where to\nlook for that info.\n-\nI don't want to pay next year. The service offered now meets my needs well\n-\nI get quite a lot of calls from solicitors, especially credit card companies. I also frequently come home to\nmessages on my machine that aren't messages, but just someone hanging up. I don't know where these\npeople get my phone number, because I don't give it out freely... I don't know if there's anything MIT can\ndo about it; maybe it's a lost cause. I also don't like the fact that if I didn't have a calling card, there would\nbe absolutely no way to call long distance. It's very frustrating once in a while when my card number\ntemporarily malfunctions, and I have no option-- not even an expensive one, not even an emergency \"Plan\nB\"-- for reaching my family (in CA) right away.\n-\nI lost my dial tone for a few days last semester, and it took a while for the people to come to fix it. Since it's\nthe only phone service I had access to, it was somewhat concerning.\n-\nI think the dorm phones are ok, though I wish caller ID were more available or cheaper.\n-\nI'm upset that we'll have to pay for it next year. A phone should come with the (high) cost of living in a\ndorm.\n-\nThere could be better displayed info about how to use the phone (example, dial 9-1-617...)\n-\nPersonally, my phone didn't work the first month I was here so my roommates and I gave up and just used\nour cell phones. Our dorm phone isn't even plugged in at this point.\n-\nThere is no operator to help you when you need help.\n-\nThey only provide local calls but most calls I need to make are outside of the 617 area code.\n-\nWe (myself +roomates) never started using it because the number we were told was ours was actually a\ncouple rooms down. Plus, we all had our own cell phones. But there was one drawback to only using our\n\nPage 25 of 47\n\nProject Randomize: VoIP Pilot Implementation at MIT\n\ncell phones--friends who did not own a cell phone could not call us because we all had long distance\nnumbers.\n-\nWell my hometown is in the 978 area code, and the dorm phones only cover 617 and 781 area codes. It's\nuseful that I can call in those area codes, but it's annoying that I live about a mile away from the 781 area\ncode line and I can't call home from my dorm phone; it's useless to buy phone service when I live that\nclose, so I have no choice but to use my cell phone to call home.\n-\nYou don't list the dorm phone numbers on the MIT search people page\n-\nYou have to dial 9-1-617 for local phone calls. The ringer on the phones given is super annoying. It makes\nme want to throw something.\n\n7. What are your thoughts about the planned $17/month fee for standard phone (local calling, voice mail) in\nthe dorm room next fall?\nStudent responses were consolidated and organized into the following general categories.\n\nI think it's a ridiculous or terrible idea.\n-\nI think it's an awful idea. At the very least we should be getting free local calls. Don't we already pay\nenough in tuition... and dorming fees... and housing tax? I don't use my phone that often - just to order in\nfood, or call someone else on campus. Don't take that away... then I WILL start going over my minutes on\nmy cell phone. And what about the people who don't have a cell phone? It is unreasonable to add on this\ncharge.\n-\nI think it's rather outrageous for IS&T to charge residents *more* money than they do already when the\ndormitory network is in such lousy condition. It is only 10 megabits, and often a poor quality connection. I\nregularly see packet loss.\n-\nI wouldn't like to have to pay so much money. Besides, it is safer for me and for all students to be able to\nuse the phone in case of an emergency.\n-\nI don't think that we should have to pay for phone service. Many comparable colleges do not make their\nstudents pay for phone service. It is bad enough that we already have to pay for cable service if we choose\nto have it(which many comparable colleges also do not make their students pay for). Many students already\npay at least $50 per month for cell phone service; now we have to pay an extra $17 for dorm phone service?\n-\nStudents should be guaranteed local phone service. Basic expectation that MIT should be able to fulfill\nwithout extra charge. Cell phones still are not universal.\n-\nI think it's ridiculous. MIT should provide free local phone service with housing, just as it provides other\nutilities such as water, electricity, and internet access. Phone service has been free for years, I see no\nreason why MIT should decide to change that.\n-\nTerrible idea. I use the local phones a lot. A lot of people get 617 area code cell phones just so we can use\ndorm phones to make these types of calls. I use the local phone to make phone calls about internships and\njobs.\n-\nAWFUL. Not only is it scalping but it's unreasonable considering how much we're paying for MIT as it is.\n-\nI think it's a bad idea. Having a dorm phone is important. For example if you have a phone interview or if\n\nPage 26 of 47\n\nProject Randomize: VoIP Pilot Implementation at MIT\n\nyou have to conduct any kind of business. It's not always appropriate to give everyone your cell phone.\nAlso I'm an officer in student groups so when I talk to corporate reps I give them my dorm phone number\nand not my cell phone. I think this looks more professional because you don't always have to keep worrying\nabout bad reception.\n\nI understand IS&T's point of view and reasoning\n-\nAt first I was upset by it, but I do think it's reasonable as long as we can still use it for inter-dorm and MIT\ncalling.\n-\nI don't like it. Phone service should come with the room. However, I do like the option they give us of not\nhaving one instead of incorporating it into the cost of the room.\n-\nProbably a prudent way to save money. i really like having the dorm phone, but a lot of people probably\ndon't use theirs and it was probably a smart decision\n-\nIf they then subtract that $17/month from the overall house bill (i.e. making it so those who use it come out\neven, those who dont save $) then it's ok\n-\nI am actually glad because now I won't get outside calls. I am glad that the phone will only be for on\ncampus calling cause I don't use it for local calling or voice mail. Now I won't get telemarketer calls.\n-\nGood, any dorm subsidies are bad.\n\nI won't be using my dorm phone.\n-\nAs long as its not mandatory I wouldn't mind because I don't use my dorm phone\n-\nDoesn't affect me, as I use my cell phone as my primary (and only!) phone\n\nI'm frustrated because I will need to use my dorm phone.\n-\nIt's awful, because I intend to be in a grad dorm next term.\n-\nI'm really frustrated, because I need to be able to make phone calls from some other place than my cell\nphone like when my cell phone is dead, or when I need to call someplace and I can't go outside to get\nreception cause my cell doesn't work inside my dorm. I feel like $17 is way too much for those services.\n-\nThat really sucks. I don't have voice-mail or anything, and I don't talk on my dorm phone- or any phone for\nthat matter, more than about 5 minutes a day. So it's really mean to make me have to pay, when I only use\nmy dorm phone on a need-to basis, and it's also the only dependable phone access I have.\n-\nI don't want to pay it. I'm also especially annoyed that we can't receive calls from the outside for free.\n-\nI think it really sucks. I use my dorm phone way more than my cellphone, and now on top of the phone\ncard expense I'll have the $17/month charge? I don't spend $17 on the phone card I use over three\nmonths! Someone in the administration should have cut something else out of the budget.\n-\nI'm adamantly against it, I need my dorm phone to make all local calls because my cell phone sometimes\ndoesn't get reception in my room, and it saves me minutes. Also, some of my friends don't have cell\nphones at they'd have no way of contacting me if we couldn't call local numbers on dorm phones.\n-\nI hate it. I resent that the administration just assumes that everyone on campus has a cell phone.\n\nPage 27 of 47\n\nProject Randomize: VoIP Pilot Implementation at MIT\n\n-\nI don't use the voice mail, but I feel that the local calling should be standard, I don't use the phone very\noften so paying $17/month would be pointless for my usage.\n-\nI think it is a horrible idea for those people w/o cell phones. I can't buy a cell phone, and even if i could, I\nidealogically would refuse to buy such a device due to its destruction and rude side affects.\n\nI do not like this plan because I mainly use my dorm phone for parental contact.\n-\nThe dorm phone is convenient because, in conjunction with a phone card, I can call family and friends in\nthe US and overseas.\n-\nWould be very sad. It is wonderful to have free local calling and incoming calls from home -- without the\nstatic we get on the cell phone.\n-\nIt's not cool, because it's my only local number, and it allows for my parents to call me without using up my\ncell phone minutes.\n-\nI use my phone MAYBE 1-2 hours a month. But, that service is necessary for my parents to call me, and\nfor me to use my phone card. Also, if the activation fee is initiated, will I be charged when I switch rooms\nin the dorm? Because for summer housing I'll live in a different room.\n-\nHate the idea. It would be okay if it didn't allow me to call out, but to have to pay it just to receive calls. I\nneed to get in touch with my parents, and it forced me to buy a cell phone plan, which is much more worth\nthe cost, which is not much more than $17 and can go anywhere.\n-\nVery unhappy. I use my dorm phone by having my parents call me on it.\n\nThe $17/month plan is too expensive.\n-\nI think it's a little steep and inconvenient for those who do use the phones here on campus as their only\nphone.\n-\nI like having the dorm room and my cell phone...I give most companies that I interviewed at my dorm\nnumber, it makes it easier to separate work and friends, and it also ensures that my connection does not cut-\nout in the middle of a call with a potential employer. The dorm room service is more reliable in the sense\nthat the signal will not fade and the quality of the sound is better. However, I don't think I would pay the\nnew $17 fee if i had the choice.\n-\n$17 per month is too much money. I definitely don't make that many local calls. I suppose if you didn't\ncharge it separately it would otherwise just end up hidden in our Bursar's bill, though, wouldn't it?\n-\nToo expensive, should at least be able to receive local calls for free. Certain delivery places need a 617\nnumber, and charging $17/month for those deliveries isn't worth it\n-\nExceptionally high. Definitely would not pay more than $6/month\n\nPage 28 of 47\n\nProject Randomize: VoIP Pilot Implementation at MIT\n\nEveryone has a cell phone and won't use the plan.\n-\nThey'll just use the Bexley desk phone, and charge MIT instead.\n-\nI don't think it should be issued. I know I would rather go over on my cell minutes than pay the $17 dollar\nfee bc it would be cheaper. However, this is bad because I use my dorm phone a lot. especially to make\nlocal calls and to 800 numbers.\n\nRandom comments & questions\n-\nMy room phone doesn't work.\n-\nBetter than charging me for rent. What about emergencies? Will I be able to get it should I need it in the\nmiddle of term for Boston Area contacts?\n-\nIf your cell phone doesn't work and your family needs to reach you in an emergency, they won't be able to\ncall your room phone. Also how can you call fraternities or FSILGs off-campus?\n\n8. Would you purchase the plan? Why or why not?\n\nResponse\nFrequency\nYes\n\nCommon comments\nFrequency\nNo other choice\nOther comments:\n-\nI am kinda forced to purchase this plan. I do not use my cell phone service freely for fear of high overage\ncharges. Therefore, any local calls that I need to make, I use my room phone, and so I will need this plan.\n-\nI mainly use the phone to make long distance calls back home on weekends, so I do not have a need for a\ncell phone. Getting a cell phone will turn out to be more expensive (than $17) for such long-dist usage.\n-\nI would have to for emergency situations at home. But I'd be angry about it.\n-\nMy location choices for placing cell phone calls are very limited, so I would still pay for the plan. Against\nmy will, but I would have to.\n-\nOnly by necessity. Phone service is a basic utility, and I don't have/want a cell phone.\n-\nThe plan is still cheaper than a cell phone. If companies offer a significant discount for MIT students, I\nmight get a cell phone instead.\n\nPage 29 of 47\n\nProject Randomize: VoIP Pilot Implementation at MIT\n\nResponse\nFrequency\nNo\n\nCommon comments\nFrequency\nDon't use dorm phone\n$17 fee too expensive\nBuy a cell phone\nIncrease use of my cell phone\n$17 fee too expensive for benefits\nI can't afford it\nUpgrade my cell phone plan\n\nOther comments:\n-\nI do not make local phone calls, nor do I need voicemail.\n-\nI don't use the phone enough for it to be worth $17, but if I have to choose I would rather get a cell phone\nand have the ability to make local AND long distance calls without having to get a long distance carrier and\npaying $17/month only for local calls.\n-\nI don't want to get telemarketer calls and I use my cell phone for everything else.\n-\nI have a cell phone. However, this fee may deter some people (who don't have cell phones) to not purchase\nthe standard package at all due to financial circumstances. I have heard a few comments about this and feel\nthis plan is very bad and dangerous for the overall well-being and safety of students.\n-\nI might just end up using my prepaid calling card. It would be cheaper.\n-\nI would still want to make local calls from a phone that is not my cell phone, but I would not purchase the\nplan in protest of its inanity.\n-\nMy friends have non-local #s, so the plan would be useless for me.\n-\nI only use dorm phones for campus calls\n-\nPerhaps if I were applying for internships or things in the Boston area.\n-\nWe would probably put the money towards a second cell phone (so that my husband and I each had one to\nuse).\n-\nThe plan is not mandatory.\n-\nGoing over on cell minutes would be cheaper.\n\nResponse\nFrequency\nMaybe\n\nPage 30 of 47\n\nProject Randomize: VoIP Pilot Implementation at MIT\n\nOther comments:\n-\nI would consider it or a cell. If I *could* make outgoing calls on my phone card without the plan, I might\nget by without it and just use the phone card for everything, since I make sufficiently less than $17/month\nworth of phone calls at $0.05/minute. My family would not be incredibly happy about not being able to\ncontact me by phone, but we would work something out.\n-\nI may just use my cell phone more.\n-\nDebatable. Again, cell phone is more worth the cost.\n\nResponse\nFrequency\nNo answer\n\n9.

I may be able to use my PDA or smartphone to call people from anywhere on campus that has wireless\naccess.\nCoolness:\n\nAverage\n4.45\nStandard Deviation\n2.15\n\nValue Added:\nAverage\n3.37\nStandard Deviation\n2.10\n\nComments:\n-\nNot many people have PDAs or smartphones.\n-\nDon't own a PDA or smartphone.\n-\nIf and only if there is wireless\n-\nI can't afford a PDA or smartphone\n-\nSmartphones are expensive, not-very-well-tested, and hard to find.

The main benefit of using a land line is because it's more clear.\n-\nIf transmission isn't clear all the time how is this technology much better than cell phones.\n\nPage 36 of 47\n\nProject Randomize: VoIP Pilot Implementation at MIT\n\nOverall comments:\n-\nAgain, you would need to convince me to use this service. for anything domestic, my cell phone rates are\nexcellent... i basically have unlimited minutes and free long distance. the only time i even considered using\nVOIP was to call overseas (while kyle was in spain). overall, i think i spent $150 in calling cards... we\nwere somewhat conservative with how long we spoke on the phone, but i still spent about $150 total on\ncalling cards. because of the amount of time we spent on the phone and the amount of time he was in\nspain, i still didn't switch. there's the switching cost to the consumer -> you have to convince me why this\nservice is much better and much cheaper AND also convince me to take the time to setup my system and\nbuy the components (ie: microphone) to use this service. i didn't want to go through the setup or buy a new\nmicrophone, and would rather have spent a little more on calling cards instead of going through the\ninconvenience of switching over.... so if you want people to use this service, that's something you need to\nconsider!\n-\nToo much computer stuff. phones work when electricity is out; cell phones too. that's when you need\nphones the most. Have a nice day.\n-\nBasically, I don't need all these fancy features, and what I do need my answering machine and my cell\nphone already do...I just want my local phone number for next year...\n-\nIf we're getting a VOIP system, it should work on Linux computers as well.\n-\nI use a VoIP to call home, and the problem I encounter is that the communication is choppy, and you can't\nhear an uninterrupted sentence. I guess it depends on the quality of the system.\n\nPage 37 of 47\n\nProject Randomize: VoIP Pilot Implementation at MIT\nAPPENDIX B: PRESENTATION SLIDES\n\nProject Randomize\nVoIP Implementation at MIT\nJohn Cloutier\nJennifer Peng\nAllison Dolan\nDirector, Telephony and IS&T Shared Services\nMay 6, 2005\n\nAgenda\n\nWhat is VoIP?\nProject Objectives/Overview\nScope\nFindings\nAnalysis\nRecommendations\nManagement Observations\nQ&A\n\nAgenda\nWhat is VoIP?\nWhat is VoIP?\nProject Objectives/Overview\nScope\nFindings\nAnalysis\nRecommendations\nManagement Observations\nQ&A\n\nPage 38 of 47\n\nProject Randomize: VoIP Pilot Implementation at MIT\n\nWhat is VoIP\n\nCalls made from\nComputer\nAnalog Phone\nCalls received by\nComputer\nAnalog Phone\nTransmitted over the\ninternet as well as\nanalog phone trunks\n\nAgenda\n\nWhat is VoIP?\nProject Objectives/Overview\nProject Objectives/Overview\nScope\nFindings\nAnalysis\nRecommendations\nManagement Observations\nQ&A\n\nProject Objectives/Overview\n\nWe're MIT, shouldn't we have VoIP?\nReasons to proceed with an installation\nObstacles that must be overcome\nInsight from other schools with VoIP\nSuggestion for best pilot program\n\nPage 39 of 47\n\nProject Randomize: VoIP Pilot Implementation at MIT\n\nAgenda\n\nWhat is VoIP?\nProject Objectives/Overview\nScope\nScope\nFindings\nAnalysis\nRecommendations\nManagement Observations\nQ&A\n\nScope\n\nConsiderations\nStudent/Administration need and openness\nPerspective from other universities with VoIP\nDepartmental interaction at MIT\nExisting infrastructure\nPossibility of a complete VoIP system in a\nnew/renovated building\nOutside Scope\nCost\nInvestigation of the technology\n\nAgenda\n\nWhat is VoIP?\nProject Objectives/Overview\nScope\nFindings\nFindings\nAnalysis\nRecommendations\nManagement Observations\nQ&A\n\nPage 40 of 47\n\nProject Randomize: VoIP Pilot Implementation at MIT\n\nFindings -

      "content": "Project Randomize\nVoIP Implementation at MIT\n\nJohn Cloutier\n\nJennifer Peng\n\nProject Proposal\n15.568\nSpring 2005\n\nCP & Associates\nProf. C. Gibson\n\nProject Outline\n\nI.\nContext for the Project\n\nVoIP (voice-over-internet protocol) technology allows users to place telephone calls over a\ncomputer/data network, rather than using traditional phone lines. The technology converts analog\nhuman voice into a digital format that can be sent over established Internet connections, providing a\nsignificant cost savings to both companies and individual consumers. Corporations can save money\nusing VoIP, as it eliminates the need to maintain both a data and telephone network in one building.\nIf individuals at both ends of the communication line are using VoIP, long distance fees are virtually\neliminated. Companies with offices spread over a large geographic area can take advantage of this\nlong distance service to cut their spending.\n\nSeveral factors prevent VoIP from gaining universal popularity. In a loss of power, VoIP phones do\nnot work while traditional phones, which are not dependent on electricity, continue to function.\nAlso, the implementation of VoIP in a traditional building with both data and phone networks may\nnot produce the significant cost savings, since replacing an old system can be expensive. Finally, the\nphone service quality might not be as clear as a traditional phone, depending on the condition of the\nnetwork.\n\nCurrently, VoIP is only used in two MIT locations: between the Media Lab and a contingent in 1\nCambridge Center and between MIT and Woods Hole. In this investigation we aim to determine\nwhat locations on campus would benefit most from a VoIP implementation.\n\nII.\nPurpose, Objectives and Approach of the Project\n\nPurpose:\nAs a leader in the development of cutting edge technology, MIT has been closely watching the\nevolution of VoIP and is now considering establishing a VoIP solution to its telephony needs. This\ntechnology has reached its tipping point by achieving functional status in the marketplace and\nbringing with it the opportunity to reduce communication costs.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to determine the best venue for a VoIP pilot project as well as address\nquestions about the installation.\n\nObjectives:\n1. Asses whether initiating a VoIP project at MIT will enhance the technological prestige of the\nuniversity and will be reasonably well embraced by students and the administration.\n2. Evaluate the VoIP installations of other universities to determine if a similar project at MIT is\nfeasible.\n3. Choose the best VoIP features and functionality for the specific implementation that is chosen\nfor the pilot project.\n4. Create a rollout schedule and procedures to make VoIP available to end users.\n\nScope:\nThe project will not provide an overview of the technology or a schedule for campus wide\ndeployment. Rather, it will propose the details of an isolated installation which, can be evaluated\nover the course of several months to determine the feasibility of implementing the project.\nPage 2 of 5\n\nAs a basis for comparison and to evaluate various options, we will investigate VoIP installations at\nother universities and measure their successes and difficulties. We will use this information to help\nassess the feasibility of an installation at MIT.\n\nAn important part of the project will be to gauge administration and student support. Determining\nhow people will react to such an installation as well as planning how to get people on board is well\nwithin the scope of this project.\n\nOne of the main road blocks to VoIP upgrades is the lack of robust infrastructure to support the new\ntechnology. Replacing outdated data networks is often far more expensive than reasonable for VoIP\nsavings. For this reason, dorms that are slated to undergo renovations were selected as candidates\nfor the pilot project. Therefore the scope of the project will not discuss data network infrastructure\nrequirements but rather assume the necessary technology is already in place.\n\nIII.

Uncertainties, Risks and Opportunities, and Planned Responses\n\nThe Project Proposal:\nThe primary mission of this project is gathering information which involves the following risks:\n1.\nDifficulties gathering data for implementations at other universities.\n2.\nAvailability of people at various MIT offices.\n3.\nParticipation in and success of the focus groups.\n\nThese connections will give us great insight into how MIT's systems work. There is little risk of\nunforeseen problems occurring, though should we be unable to glean the needed information from\nthese sources, we will look elsewhere at MIT, moving up the chain of command as necessary.\n\nThe Project:\nAny number of problems may occur during the completion of this project. Support from the\nadministration, IS&T, Facilities as well as students will be critical to its success. Part of the scope of\nthis project proposal will be to gauge and find ways of getting this support as well as strategize what\ncan be done if it fails. A key aspect of this project will be to integrate the new technology without\ndisturbing the culture of the dorm. On the administration side, we need to work carefully with IS&T\nto ensure that their concerns are addressed.\n\nCost will not be a factor in the completion of the project report. VoIP systems are inherently very\ninexpensive which is one of their main selling points. However, addressing possible cost barriers to\nthe implementation of a VoIP solution will be an important possible road block to address.\n\n.V.\nCritical Success Factors\n\nA large portion of our project depends on information extracted from interviews. As a team, we\nneed to gain contact with the IS&T department, administrator and students. It is critical that we\ncomplete these interviews by the first week because the responses might reveal information that can\nchange the course of our project. If we are finding difficulties getting interviews, we will look to\nProfessor Gibson, our TA Evan or our champion Allison Dolan for suggestions.\n\nIt is also critical that we obtain accurate estimates for VoIP implementation costs. We will be\ncalculating the costs and ROI of implementing a system, so adequate research of the pricing\ninformation is essential. We rely on Allison for these estimates since she already has this data on\nhand. If it turns out Allison does not have these resource we will look to our professor and TA for\nmore leads.\n\nAnother aspect of our project is the evaluation of VoIP on campuses that have implemented it. We\nwill need to contact informative people at University of Michigan and Dartmouth. If we are unable\nto locate the correct people, we will once again look to our professor, TA and champion for advice.\n\nMost importantly, it is crucial that our project has a solid and reliable team. MIT is a very stressful\nand demanding environment. Coordinating meeting times, completing all the tasks and producing\nquality work requires dedication and trust. Ensuring that three busy people can work together is\nextremely important. Each team member must be able to express his or her opinion and be an equal\ncontributor in the group. If this is not happening, our team will have to meet and solve the problem.\n\nVI.\nGANTT Chart\n\nPage 4 of 5\n\nReview VoIP Literature(3/27)\n\nGather info on current phone\nsystem (4/1)\n\nGather info on VoIP System\n(4/1)\n\nInfo on Other Schools (3/30)\nMeet with G&M (4/13)\nMeet with AFD\n(4/13)\n\nAssemble student focus\ngroups (3/27)\nConduct Focus groups\n(4/13)\nMeet with G&M\n(4/20)\nMeet with AFD\n(4/20)\nMeet with\nG&M (5/1)\nAssemble administrator focus\ngroups (3/27)\nSurvey MIT Community\n(4/13)\nROI on VoIP (4/20)\nPrepare PPT\n(5/1)\nFinal Write up\n(5/8)\n\nSearch and Review\nField Data Gathering\nAnalysis of Data\nGathering\nPresentation\nFinal Report\n1 week\n2 weeks\n1.5 weeks\n1.5 week\n1 weeks\n\n*G&M=Gibson & Mamas\n\n*AFD= Allison F Dolan\n\nMarch 9, 2005\n\nPage 5 of 5"

      "content": "Project Status Report\nTo:\nProf. C. Gibson, Allison Dolan, Evan Mamas\nFrom: John Cloutier, Jennifer Peng\nRe:\nProject Ramdomize VoIP status report\nDate: March 17, 2005\nThe VoIP at MIT research project as originally described in our proposal is progressing\nnicely. We have completed several rounds of revisions and are now considering\nnarrowing the scope of the project to accommodate the loss of one team member. The\nproject dashboard light is yellow.\nAccomplishments\nSince the original version, we have gone through a rigorous revision process for our\nproject proposal. Both Evan and Allison had an opportunity to review our proposal and\nsuggest changes. The collaboration added quite a bit of value to the project because there\nwere several drastic changes to our scope and purpose.\n\nFirst, we will not be looking at the infrastructure requirements for a VoIP installation. In\nlight of the loss of one of the members of our team this will adjust the size of the project\nto make it better fit a two person team.\n\nAdditionally, we will be adding the selection of a location as part of the project rather\nthan a predetermined solution. We will take into account student and faculty concerns\nand then select the best location for our recommendation.\n\nChoosing the appropriate hardware was originally one of the goals of the project, but has\nbeen deleted since IS&T has already done substantial research in this area.\n\nIssues\nThe main barrier that has arisen was the loss of Jose Barraza. This uncertainty had not\nbeen previously considered, but has been dealt with by the re-scoping described above. It\nis likely that we will need to undergo another round of final approvals before we can\nproceed with the newly sized project. Once this had been completed we will be able to\nbegin work on the project.\n\nActions to be Taken\nOn Tuesday, an article was run by MIT's student newspaper, The Tech, regarding the\ndecision to begin charging undergraduate dormitory residents for local telephone service.\nThis decision is directly relevant to our project for two reasons. The first is that VoIP\nmay be a possible alternative method of voice communication in dorms which could be\nprovided at very little cost. Secondly, we are uniquely positioned to work with MIT on\nthis situation as Allison is the director of telephony for IS&T. We will add discussing\nthis with Allison to our list of tasks and consider integrating into our project.\n\nThere has been too much time spent on project revisions, so our team needs to begin\ngetting data and interviews. We need to begin contacting various administrators and\n\nstudents at MIT for our project. In addition, further research on VoIP is necessary for our\nteam to conduct interviews. It is crucial that we present the interviewees with\ninformation and insights on how VoIP technology would benefit their lives.\n\nReflections and Learning\nThe most recently completed topic module was Implementation and Change:\n\"Technology is the least of our problems.\" This topic is very relevant to our VoIP\nproject because a huge hurdle is trying to convince the MIT administration and students\nthe benefits of this technology. Allison informed us that it is unclear where and how\nVoIP could be best implemented on campus. Similar to the First National City Bank\ncase, a successful implementation of VoIP would require converting a massive group of\npeople to a new technology. There will be skeptics of VoIP, so our group needs to\ninterview these individuals and obtain a well-rounded survey of opinions.\n\nOur team is definitely learning a life lesson on being flexible. First we had to deal with\nbeing the smallest group, with only three people. Then we had to work around\neveryone's busy schedules, especially John's UA Presidency campaign. The final and\nmost trying obstacle was Jose's unexpected medical leave, which led to a drastic re-\nscoping of our project. We have had more challenges than any of the other two groups\ncombined, but we have been able to work well with each other and stay focused on the\nproject. We've learned that being a solid team is the most important aspect of a project."

      "content": "Project Status Report\nTo:\nProf. C. Gibson, Allison Dolan, Evan Mamas\nFrom: John Cloutier, Jennifer Peng\nRe:\nProject Randomize VoIP status report\nDate: March 31, 2005\nThe VoIP at MIT research project has had quite a few bumps in the last few weeks.\nSince the loss of one of the team members, we have had a week long break during which\nlittle progress could be made. Upon returning from break, one of the remaining team\nmembers, John Cloutier, had medical problems to address which hindered work on the\nproject. The dashboard light is currently yellow.\nAccomplishments\nThe final version of the project proposal including all scope changes has been reviewed\nby both remaining team members, Allison, Professor Gibson and Evan. Now that the\nroadmap has been reset, we can begin to progress toward completing required tasks.\n\nDespite the temporary setback, we have not missed too many deadlines. By this date we\nwere supposed to:\n\n-\nEveryone to review literature of evolution of VoIP, especially the pros and cons regarding the\nreliability and maintenance (3/27)\n-\n(all) determine the student representation we would like to see in the focus groups (3/27)\n-\n(all) determine the administration representation we would like to see in the focus groups\n(3/27)\n-\n(open) gather information on how the development of VoIP has been carried out at other\ncolleges and universities (University of Michigan, Dartmouth) (3/30)\n\nWe have reviewed some of the VoIP literature Allison has so graciously offered to us.\nWe have also determined the student representation of our focus group to consist of a\ncross section of the undergraduate population, with greater emphasis on Simmons\nresidents. John was in the process of obtaining a list of administrators to include in our\nfocus group.\n\nOn Tuesday, Jennifer presented an overview of the VoIP project to the class. She\ndiscussed the motivation and goals for the project as well as the progress that has been\nmade so far. The feedback from the class was extremely helpful in creating questions for\nthe surveys and provided valuable leads for our project. The thoughts that were shared\nby the class are immediately relevant because they came from students who will likely be\ndirectly affected by a VoIP solution.\n\nJennifer completed surveys for the three groups that need to be interviewed, other\nuniversities, students and administrators. These surveys were recently sent to Professor\nGibson, Evan, Allison and John for additional feedback, therefore the last deadline to\ncontact other colleges and universities will not met in time. Once these surveys are\ncomplete they can be distributed in order to begin collecting our data.\n\nIssues\nThere has been slow progress since the last status report. This isn't a failure per se and is\nmostly the result of spring break taking everyone away from the project. Now that school\nhas begun again, work can continue in earnest.\n\nJohn Cloutier was injured during spring break and has therefore not been able to help\nwith the project since the beginning of this week. John hopes that most of the hospital\nvisits are over and that his recovery will be speedy so he can get back to work.\n\nActions to be Taken\nSeveral tasks will be undertaken shortly. First, the surveys will be completed and\ndistributed to our contacts on campus and at other schools. This will be a huge source of\ninformation for our project and will greatly effect the conclusions that are reached.\n\nAllison was also able to provide us with contact information for some key administrators\nwho we will interview. We need to gather background information about the status of\ndata and voice service as well as plans for future upgrades on campus.\n\nRecent changes to dorm phone service have created a stir in the in undergraduate\npopulation. We will be looking into the possibility of integrating this change into the\nproject. Allison has warned against falling into a debate on the issue of charging for\ndorm phone service and as of yet we don't know exactly how or if we will include this\nsubject as part of the project. We will need to be careful on this issue.\n\nReflections and Learning\nIt is always difficult to accept that a project is being hindered by unforeseen events. At\nfirst when Jose was having medical problems we assumed that the two remaining group\nmembers would be able to fill in while he was gone and that the project wouldn't be\ndrastically effected. In the beginning, we felt that this type of information gathering\nproject didn't really have too many opportunities for unforeseen problems getting in the\nway. Since then we've seen that anything can happen. The article Managing Project\nUncertainty: from variation to chaos was an important one. Even a seemingly simple\nproject can be turned on its head by uncertainty.\n\nOur team is continuing to learn a valuable lesson about being flexible. Our small group\nhas been set back several times by busy schedules and unexpected events from UA\nelections to medical problems. We have had more challenges than the other two groups\ncombined, but we have been able to work well with each other and stay focused on the\nproject. We've learned that being a solid team is the most important aspect of a project.\nIt appears there is a light at the end of the tunnel and work should be progressing\nsmoothly in the near future."

One such technology is voice over IP which uses the internet to place phone calls.\nAs a world leader in science and technology it has been suggested that MIT should begin to\nimplement these new devices.\n\nProject Summary:\nProject Randomize was initiated to investigate possible motivations for using VoIP at MIT as\nwell as to evaluate installations at other schools and gauge student and administration interest.\nDuring our investigation we spoke to various administrators in IS&T as well as surveyed\nundergraduate students about their phone use. Based on the responses we received, we are able\nto make a recommendation for further study of the subject of VoIP at MIT in the form of a pilot\ntargeted at students. In his capacity as Undergraduate Association President, John Cloutier will\nbe assisting Allison Dolan the Director of Telephony and Shared Serviced for IS&T to finalize\nthe details for the pilot over the summer for deployment during the first few weeks of the fall\nterm.\n\nThe pilot will serve to explore the different types of VoIP phones and features available while\nminimizing the effect on MIT's existing network infrastructure. Marketing this pilot to\nundergraduates will help IS&T address the recent additional phone charges that have been\nmandated by providing an alternative for students who can't afford the fee. This topic has\nalready received a lot of attention in The Tech student newspaper which recently ran a story\ndescribing our recommended pilot to undergraduates (See Appendix G).\n\nThe other recommendation we are making is to ensure efforts are made to improve\ncommunication between the various groups involved. Network and telephony departments must\nwork together for this hybrid technology installation to proceed. Without this cooperation, we\nfeel VoIP cannot go further at MIT.\n\nScope:\nThe technology itself was not a primary focus of our investigation as this type of study would not\nadd value to the project for IS&T. Cost was not considered either as IS&T is already in the best\nposition to evaluate the expense of such a program. Rather we took the approach of an objective\nthird party gathering information to help IS&T make the best decision about how to dive into\nVoIP.\n\nProject Evaluation:\nAlthough Project Randomize was hindered by the loss a group member and difficulty contacting\nIT resources at other schools (and here at MIT), the final analysis has proven to be quite\nvaluable. The insight we were able to provide to IS&T will likely result in a 100 student pilot\ndeployment in the fall. Although Jennifer will be graduating, John will continue to work with\nAllison on bringing VoIP to MIT.\n\nPage 4 of 47\n\nProject Randomize: VoIP Pilot Implementation at MIT\nPROJECT SCOPE AND METHODOLOGY\nThe primary goal of this project is to collect information from various sources in order to provide\nIS&T with some insight into what the MIT community wants and how other schools have\naddressed the same issues.\n\nWITHIN SCOPE\nOther Schools:\nWe did phone interviews with several network administrators at the University of North Carolina\nand Dartmouth. They provided us with a description of their current status and future plans for\nVoIP. They were also able to share with us some of the road blocks they faced when installing\nVoIP and gave their perspective on the human impact of this new technology.\n\nMIT:\nOur data collection at MIT took two forms. First, we interviewed several people from IS&T\nwith different areas of expertise (networks, telephony, VoIP) to gauge the current status of\nnetwork infrastructure, VoIP deployments and departmental interest and interactions. Second,\nwe distributed a student survey which addressed general telephone usage as well as interest in\nVoIP. This survey was designed to gauge student reactions to IS&T's new $17/month phone fee\nto be implemented in Fall 2005. Over 75 responses were received and tabulated.\n\nThe final recommendation includes an analysis of these data along with several 'next steps' for\nfurther action. Central to the project was evaluating existing network infrastructure and upgrade\nplans in order to determine what kind of pilot would be feasible. Along with the technological\nrequirements we looked at departmental interaction and processes for campus computing that\nmight affect the success of VoIP.\n\nNOT CONSIDERED\nSeveral aspects of a VoIP installation were not considered in the project because our team would\nnot have been able to provide any additional insight IS&T does not already have. Both network\nand telephony groups have already done investigations of the technology available for VoIP. In\neach case, they have been in contact with manufacturers who sell the needed hardware and are\nvery knowledgeable about how VoIP works both theoretically and in practice. For this reason\nwe did not look to investigate the actual technology nor did we consider cost as an issue. IS&T\nis much better suited to make decisions about what to spend and for which products.\n\nPage 5 of 47\n\nProject Randomize: VoIP Pilot Implementation at MIT\nFINDINGS\nDARTMOUTH\nOur telephone interview with Larry Levine at Dartmouth University gave us a first hand\nexperience with VoIP which was used to make the call. Dartmouth recently underwent a major\nupgrade to its telephone and data systems. The analog telephone switch they had been using\nreached the end of its life span which gave them the opportunity to replace it with a VoIP\nproduct. Dartmouth elected to provide brand new VoIP telephones to every staff member at the\nexpense of the IT department. One of the main drawbacks to these types of phones is that they\nare quite expensive so departments aren't eager to invest in replacing all their old handsets.\n\nIn order to make this installation possible, Dartmouth had to do a major upgrade to its data\nnetwork infrastructure. They increased bandwidth to slower areas and added uninterruptible\npower supplies to ensure the network stayed up even during a power outage.\n\nIn addition to network upgrades, Dartmouth also realized the importance of calculating the\nhuman impact VoIP would have on users. They found that in many cases, increasing the number\nof available features was detrimental because it confused users by giving them too much to learn\nand too many options from which to choose. Training staff to use the new phone system was not\na trivial issue. Many users at Dartmouth were used to doing things a certain way and had\ndifficulty transitioning to the new technology. Even if VoIP phones allowed people to check\ntheir voice mail with a single button, if people were used to dialing a string of digits to call a VM\noperator, the new method would cause more frustration during the learning process.\n\nThe VoIP implementation for Dartmouth students is somewhat different. Unlike MIT,\nDartmouth does not provide telephones in student housing and could not expect students to buy\nexpensive VoIP phones with their own money. Instead they installed phone switches that were\nintegrated to the campus wide VoIP network on one side and allowed users to attach regular\nanalog phones on their side. This part of the project is therefore invisible to end users.\n\nUNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA\nWe also spoke with James Oberlin and Tyler Johnson from the University of North Carolina\nabout what they are doing with VoIP. Unlike the Dartmouth project, UNC has chosen to deploy\nVoIP to individual buildings and departments as a complete telephony solution. The first was\nWUNC, the campus radio station and the next will be two new IT buildings which are currently\nunder construction.\n\nThe motivation for UNC's pilots was not a business one but rather meant to enable academic\ncollaboration and to further investigate the technology. They stressed the issue that conventional\ncircuit based telephony business models do not work for VoIP. As a result, they are not\nattempting to sell VoIP as a solution to cut departmental expenses, but rather to explore new\npossibilities in communication technology.\n\nAnother aspect of VoIP that is being considered is wireless and cellular phones. The idea is that\nno one would want to have a phone that is hardwired to their office phone jack if they could use\na wireless phone much like their 802.11b laptop or PDA. However for this to work, wireless\ncoverage on campus would need to be much more robust. People would not accept a phone that\nPage 6 of 47\n\nProject Randomize: VoIP Pilot Implementation at MIT\ncould only be used indoors for example. For this reason, wireless VoIP at UNC is still years\naway.\n\nMIT ADMINISTRATORS\n\nJeff Schiller - Network Manager\nWe spoke with Jeff Schiller to get an idea of the existing network topography and plans for\nfuture upgrades. VoIP requires a more robust network than other types of data traffic, so\nensuring a quality network is in place is of primary importance. According to Jeff, much of\nMIT's network is too old to handle VoIP. However, whenever buildings are constructed or\nrenovations completed, the new network that is installed should be sufficient to handle voice\ntraffic. However, there are several other important factors to consider in this process.\n\nThe Department of Facilities and IS&T don't always agree on the best ways to deploy a network\ninstallation or upgrade. In the past, funding would flow at the discretion of Facilities and often\nwould not be enough for IS&T to fund a strong enough network. While this funding problem\nseems to have been addressed by taking network allocations away from Facilities, other\ndifficulties such as agreeing on the size and location of data closets still exist.\n\nThe telephony staff and network staff come from very different backgrounds. The circuit based\ntelephone model is based on providing a metered service. In other words, people are charged\nbased on how much they use the service. Contrasted with that is the internet model which\nprovides relatively inexpensive (often free) transmission of an unlimited amount of data. Analog\nphone networks also have a huge amount of sunk infrastructure that makes adapting to new\ntechnology more difficult and time consuming. IP network on the other hand are always rapidly\nchanging and growing in what might be considered by telephonists to be a very unstable\nenvironment. Standards that exist today might be ancient history in a few years.\n\nFigure 1\n\nFigure 2\n\nThese differences have even influenced how hardware for VoIP systems is designed. Lucent\nmakes VoIP products from the perspective of and with experience in telephone systems whereas\nCisco takes an IP network approach to its designs. These differences can lead the two groups to\nselecting different ways to solve the same problem. Since VoIP is very much a hybrid\ntechnology, they will be forced to work together in order to implement any pilot project.\n\nPage 7 of 47\n\nProject Randomize: VoIP Pilot Implementation at MIT\nThe final issue that Jeff raised was that VoIP is still a techie toy and is not yet marketable to\ndepartments as a communication solution. Once the technology and standards develop a bit\nmore and a workable business model can be created, VoIP will become a legitimate alternative to\nanalog telephony.\n\nMIT STUDENTS\nThe 20 question survey produced a great deal of information about student reactions to the\n$17/month phone plan, their cell phone to dorm phone usage and feelings towards VoIP\ntechnology. List below are several of the main findings from the data. The complete list of\nfindings can be found in Appendix A: MIT Student Survey Data.\n\nProfile of Surveyed Students\nThere were 75 student responses, of which 27 male, 47 female and 1 transgender. The class\ndistribution was pretty even with 17% Class of 2005; 27% Class of 2006; 25% Class of 2007;\n29% Class of 2008; 2% Graduate Students. All the undergraduate dorms except Senior Haus\nwere surveyed. Apparently, the e-mail survey was never forwarded to Senior Haus. The one\ngraduate student response lived in Tang.\n\nPercentage of Cell Phone Users\nThe myth that everyone has a cell phone is partially true. 79% of the surveyed students owned\ncell phones while 21% did not.\n\nDormitory Phone Use\nAs shown in Figure 3, an equal portion of students use their dormitory phones for either 0% or\n100% of their phone calls. The majorityof those surveyed students use their dormitory phones\nfor less than 50% of their calls however, an interesting point is that there is a small, core group\nof students who rely mostly on their dorm phones. They spend about 60% to 100% of their calls\non dorm phones.\n\nFigure 3\nDormitory Phone Use\n0.1\n% of phone use spent on Dorm phone\nNumber of People\n\nPage 8 of 47\n\nProject Randomize: VoIP Pilot Implementation at MIT\nReactions to $17/month fee\nOur results found three main types of reactions to the $17/month phone plan fee: Indifferent,\nOutraged and Understanding.\n\nThe Indifferent group, 70% of the respondents, had a range in emotion from anger to frustration,\nbut in the end were unaffected by the $17/month fee. The Indifferent were typically heavy cell\nphone users that were unfazed by the elimination of the current dormitory phone privileges.\nThey could continue using their cell phones as is or upgrade their cell phone plans to incorporate\nmore minutes. One person even commented that it would be less expensive to pay overage\ncharges each month than to pay this $17/month fee. Those who did not own cell phones felt that\npurchasing a calling card would meet their minimal phone use.\n\nThe Outraged group, 23% of the respondents, was extremely affected by the $17/month fee. The\nOutraged individuals did not own cell phones, couldn't afford cell phones or didn't use the phone\nenough to pay $17/month for dormitory phone use. Many of these individuals use the current\nMIT dormitory phone service to receive phone calls from their parents. We found that these\nindividuals tended to live in the Massachusetts area and therefore were able to use the 617 area\ncode to their advantage. Several students commented that phone service was a basic necessity\nthat other universities offered and were appalled at the fact it would be taken away.\n\nThe Understanding group, 7% of the respondents, felt this was a practical decision by the IS&T\ndepartment. These students understood that very few students use their dorm phones anymore\nand that it would provide cost savings for MIT.\n\nPurchase the Plan?\nOf the students surveyed,16% said they would purchase the new phone plan. These students\ncommented on how they felt forced to purchase the plan because they no other choice. The 79%\nthat said they would not purchase the plan felt they didn't need their dorm phone, the service was\ntoo expensive or they couldn't afford it. The 5% of the students who were still deciding were\ntrying to determine if they should just upgrade their cell phone, buy a cell phone, get a calling\ncard or just buy the service. Basically there were no students who were enthusiastic about the\n$17/month phone plan.\n\nFeelings towards VoIP Technology\nThe second half of the survey listed various qualities about VoIP technology and how it would\naffect the students' lives. The survey explained qualities such as how voicemails could be saved\nas audio files or how phone calls could be made from laptops. The students were also allowed to\nrate how \"cool\" the feature was and how much value it added to their lives. Overall there was\napathy and indifference to the features of VoIP technology. None of the listed features had a\nstatistically significant approval of any feature.\n\nThis unenthusiastic attitude for VoIP may be attributed to the students' lack of knowledge for\nVoIP technology. They do not realize VoIP's benefits and ease of use. Furthermore, students\nrequire and expect very little from their phone service. The variety of services offered by VoIP\nis not as enticing as if presented to a business person or technology guru. Students are satisfied\nwith their cell phone service because they only need the ability to call their family and friends.\n\nPage 9 of 47\n\nProject Randomize: VoIP Pilot Implementation at MIT\nTelemarketers\nSurprisingly, telemarketers are a huge nuisance to students across the campus. They call\nstudents in the early morning and early evening. One student respondent said he like the new\nproposed phone plan because it eliminated the ability to receive incoming non-MIT calls. On the\nother hand, students were frustrated because paying for the $17/month fee would be equivalent\nto paying to receive telemarketer calls.\n\nProblems with Current Dorm Phone Service\nThere were also a number of complaints about the current MIT dormitory phone service. One\nstudent from MacGregor does not have a telephone jack in his room . This same student, as well\nas a student from New House, didn't have their proper dormitory phone number listed in the\nMIT directory. When people tried to call them, the phone of the person down the hall would\nring. There were also issues in New House where one student's dorm phone didn't work for\nseveral months. Now she doesn't even have her dorm phone plugged in.\n\nPage 10 of 47\n\nProject Randomize: VoIP Pilot Implementation at MIT\nANALYSIS AND CONCLUSIONS\nSCALE OF PILOT\nLarge Implementation\nIt is unlikely that a large scale VoIP implementation could be completed in the near future. This\nrefers to both installing VoIP as the primary voice communication solution in an entire building\nor department as well as replacing the legacy voice switch with a VoIP capable switch. Much of\nMIT's existing network infrastructure is not robust enough to handle the needs of VoIP.\nAlthough they are slowly being upgraded, the costs involved in speeding up these repairs\ncombined with those of staff transition far outweigh any benefit VoIP might provide to interested\ndepartments.\n\nIt is similarly not reasonable to discard the 5E only a few years into its decade long life span.\nDartmouth was able to take advantage of the fact that its legacy switch was end the end of its\ndepreciation to replace it with a VoIP switch. MIT should maintain its current process for\nupgrading the phone system and begin planning a replacement two years prior to the 5E's demise\nin 2009. In the time between now and then, every effort should be made to investigate the kind\nof VoIP features that could be integrated into the new phone system in 2011.\n\nSmall Implementation\nDuring this period of further study, a small pilot should be undertaken to explore the types of\nphones and features that might be of value to MIT in the future. To help address the issue of the\n$17 per month dorm phone charge, this pilot could be deployed to students who would otherwise\nhave difficulty affording phone service. The non-mission critical nature of residential voice\nservice as compared to administration voice service is another benefit of a student program. It is\nalso vital that this program have only a minimal impact on existing network infrastructure and\nnot require any type of construction or upgrades to be done. For this reason, commercially\navailable 'VoIP in a box' solutions would work best.\n\nCULTURAL DIFFERENCES\nIt has become quite clear during the course of our investigation that telephone and IP networks\nare quite different. One is not inherently better or worse than the other (contrary to what some\nmight want us to think), but these differences become important when the hybrid technology of\nVoIP requires the two to be joined. Phones are circuit (one to one) based, IP networks are packet\nbased (one to many). Phone use is metered, internet use is unlimited. The two work in different\nways and break in different ways. These differences must be taken into account when choosing\na VoIP solution so that phone service and network functionality are both protected.\n\nDEPARTMENTAL COOPERATION\nIn much the same way as the two types of service fundamentally differ, often it can seem that the\ntwo departments within IS&T are coming from different places. If something goes wrong, the\ntwo groups will approach a solution from very different points of view. This could become an\nobstacle for collaboration, but should instead be though of as an opportunity to gather several\ndifferent perspectives in order to find the best overall solution.\n\nPage 11 of 47\n\nProject Randomize: VoIP Pilot Implementation at MIT\n\nSome of the issues with Facilities/IS&T cooperation have been addressed and so too must be the\ninternal IS&T feelings. Everything from the planning of the new system to choosing hardware to\nadministrating a joint telephony/network project must be approached as a collaboration. Only\nwhen this is achieved will VoIP at MIT be possible.\n\nPage 12 of 47\n\nProject Randomize: VoIP Pilot Implementation at MIT\nRECOMMENDATIONS AND NEXT STEPS\n\nVOIP PILOT IN STUDENT DORMITORIES\nImplementing a VoIP pilot in student dormitories in Fall 2005 will be the most feasible and\neffective thing solution in addressing this $17/month phone plan issue. It is to the benefit of the\nMIT administration to extend a possible alternative to the fee. If students feel the administration\nis cold heartedly implementing initiatives and taking away services, there will be tension\nbetween the two. This VoIP pilot will allow students see that the administration is working with\nstudents.\n\nTest Multiple Technologies\nIt is recommended that IS&T utilizes the commercial VoIP products out in the market. The\ntelephony department can deploy the three types of VoIP phone technologies: analog phone with\ntelephony adaptor, VoIP phone and soft phone. Distribute the phones randomly to students and\nsurvey their satisfaction with the technology.\n\nPilot Participants\nIS&T can extend the survey to any type of MIT student. It can be limited to only undergraduates\nin undergraduate dorms, undergraduates in any dorm or graduate students in dormitories. The\nselection of the participant pool should not produce any radically different results. However we\nrecommend working with the undergraduate population since you have the direct assistance of\nthe incoming UA president, John Cloutier.\n\nTime Period\nThe ideal time period to target students is Orientation and the first week of classes. Students\ntend to become busier and less responsive to surveys as the semester progresses. Therefore, it\nwould be wise to distribute the follow-up survey either in the middle of the semester or the\nbeginning of the spring semester.\n\nAdvertising & Publicity\nIt is most effective to advertise to students through e-mails and The Tech. Send quick and\ninformative e-mails to students through their dormitory e-mail lists. Many dorms have a more\nofficial e-mailing list as well as an informal e-mailing list. Send your pilot advertisements\nthrough the former to receive a better response. Call the Tech to get another article written about\nthe pilot. A front page headline is more effective than any Tech advertisement, poster or spam.\nSeveral articles have been written about the phone charge issue and on May 10, 2005 The Tech\nran a story about this project and our recommended pilot (See Appendix G).\n\nAnother way to get information about the VoIP pilot is to arrange an information booth in the\nStudent Center. This booth could even be a central location for equipment pick up, if you choose\nto have students install the equipment themselves. The Student Center has more traffic than\nLobby 10, which is another popular location for information booths.\n\nHelp Desk\nIn order to not bias the VoIP pilot, IS&T needs to create a convenient and accessible \"help\ndesk.\" This \"help desk\" should be available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to answer VoIP\nPage 13 of 47\n\nProject Randomize: VoIP Pilot Implementation at MIT\nphone problems. IS&T will not want the pilot survey results to be filled with complaints about\nunanswered questions. The pilot should try to simulate a well run VoIP system.\n\nContact Persons\nWork with the Undergraduate Association, Graduate Student Council and dormitory house\nmanagers to effectively execute this pilot. These three groups have the most power and contact\nwith the potential pilot participants. Refer to the following links for contact information for each\ngroup.\n\n\"OUTRAGED\" STUDENTS\nProject Randomize obtained preliminary information about the various student responses. We\nstrongly recommend IS&T or next semester's 15.568 class to further investigate this \"outraged\"\ngroup. Many of these students are international or local Massachusetts students. Determine this\ngroup's actual phone use to see if VoIP technology or a revised phone plan is the best solution.\nMost students are indifferent or unaffected by the $17/month plan so it is important to make sure\nIS&T is not ignoring these \"outraged\" students' needs.\n\nADMINISTRATION INTEREST IN VOIP\nThe project's findings discovered that students were not too impressed by the technological\nadvantages of VoIP technology, but the administration might have a more positive reaction.\nCurrently, Dennis Baron of the IS&T department has been introducing VoIP technology to a\nhandful of professors who find it very intriguing and useful. IS&T could deploy a pilot among\nthe administrators and professors to determine their level of interest. Even if this pilot doesn't\nspawn an immediate implementation, it can serve as a gateway for educating the administration\nand faculty about VoIP until MIT is ready to fully implement in 2011.\n\nPage 14 of 47\n\nProject Randomize: VoIP Pilot Implementation at MIT\nSUMMARY MESSAGE AND OBSERVATIONS\nProject Randomize has taught us many valuable lessons about IT project management and\ndealing with real world complications.\n\nPlan for Uncertainty\nOur team definitely learned the difficulties uncertainty can bring to a project. First we had to\ndeal with being the smallest group, with only three people. Then Jose Barraza's unexpected\nmedical leave led to a drastic re-scoping of our project. In the midst of trying to catch up and\nmeet deliverable deadlines, John Cloutier was unexpectedly injured on a Spring Break trip to\nIreland. Throughout the project, we had to work around everyone's busy schedules, including\nJohn's UA Presidency campaign. We had more challenges than any of the other two groups\ncombined, but we were able to work well with each other and stay focused on the project.\nWe've learned that being a solid team is the most important aspect of a project.\n\nIt is always difficult to accept that a project is being hindered by unforeseen events. In the\nbeginning, we felt that this type of information gathering project didn't really have too many\nopportunities for unforeseen problems getting in the way. Since then we've seen that even\nseemingly simple projects like ours can be turned into chaos. The article Managing Project\nUncertainty: from variation to chaos stresses the importance of identifying foreseen\nuncertainties and creating a contingency plan. In retrospect, losing a member of a team is a\nforeseen circumstance; however temporarily losing a team member as a result of a Spring Break\ntrip is unforeseen. In one class discussion, after explaining our project's unforeseen\ncircumstances, Tyco CEO Dana Deasy stressed the importance of thinking of any possible\nunforeseen uncertainty for a project. After Project Randomize we will always follow his\nvaluable advice for future projects.\n\nProject Randomize was primarily an information gathering project. We didn't have a budget or\nany concrete system changes to implement. As such we were relying solely on help from other\npeople to learn about VoIP, computer infrastructure and programs at other schools. When our\ngroup had difficulties arranging the interviews with other universities, Professor Gibson offered\nto try to contact these individuals for us, seeing that a Professor would get more attention and\nrespect than an undergraduate student. This reinforced the importance of having a backup plan.\nOur original project proposal had listed going to Professor Gibson as a solution if we\nencountered problems. If we had not created or utilized our backup plan, we would have been at\na formidable roadblock.\n\nHuman Acceptance of Technology\nFrom our interview with Dartmouth, we learned that humans play a key role in the success of an\nIT project. Similar to the First National City Bank case where the employees actually revolted\nand sabotaged the new machinery the first day of the implementation, Dartmouth had\ncomplications as well. The VoIP phone users were used to the habits and operations of the\ntraditional phones. When the VoIP phones did not respond the way the users expected them to,\nthey became extremely frustrated with the new technology and complained. For example, the\nusers expected to have a dial tone when they picked up a VoIP phone, but their VoIP phones\nnaturally don't have dial tones. The Dartmouth Computing Services department had to address\nthese human issues before the culture accepted the technology.\n\nPage 15 of 47\n\nProject Randomize: VoIP Pilot Implementation at MIT\n\nThe module Implementation and Change: \"Technology is the least of our problems\" was very\nrelevant to our VoIP project because a huge hurdle is trying to convince and educate the MIT\nadministration and students about the benefits of this technology. Allison informed us that it is\nunclear where and how VoIP could be best implemented on campus. Similar to the First\nNational City Bank case, a successful implementation of VoIP would require converting a\nmassive group of people to a new technology.\n\nAnother way to expedite human acceptance of technology is to make technology easy, as\nmentioned in the Make It Simple article. If they implement VoIP technology, the IS&T\ndepartment needs to make sure it passes \"the mom test,\" which basically says that widely\naccepted technology should be so user friendly that even your grandmother could operate it.\nTechnology gurus get too wrapped up in the \"coolness\" of a technology and forget to win over\nthe mainstream crowd. Keeping technology simple is critical to a successful IT implementation.\n\nCooperation and Support from Departments\nIn our research we discovered the fundamental differences between telephony and network\nservices. VoIP technology requires the cooperation between these two groups because if\nsomething goes wrong, the two groups will approach a solution from very different points of\nview. This situation has taught us that cooperation between all groups involved in an IT project\nis crucial to success.\n\nIn the heated debate following the announcement of the $17/month phone plan, Allison warned\nus to tread carefully when speaking to administrators at MIT to not give them the wrong\nimpression of our project's motives or make them feel threatened. The concerns here were\nsimilar to those of the Administrative Data Project Case in which technological progress was\nhindered by a deeply ingrained school culture of very autonomous departments that didn't work\ntogether. The success of their project was directly dependant on getting other people on the\nbandwagon and supporting the change.\n\nAdditionally, in the AIRNow Case Chet Wayland was able to garner the support and work of\npeople that weren't being compensated for their efforts. IT project managers should follow Chet\nWayland's lead and try to mobilize various groups of people to work towards one goal.\n\nPage 16 of 47\n\nProject Randomize: VoIP Pilot Implementation at MIT\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nWe would like to offer special thanks to those without whom this project would never have been\npossible.

List any complaints you have about cell phone service here at MIT.\n\nResponse\nFrequency\nn/a\nNone\nGenerally good coverage\nBad reception\n\nOf the 55 bad reception complaints, the most problematic areas were\nInfinite corridor\nMany locations in MIT\nStudent center\nCement buildings\nClassrooms\nBottom floor of student center\nUnderground labs\nEastern end of infinite corridor\nMcCormick\nBuilding 68\nKresge Auditorium\n10-250\n\nOther comments:\n-\nFor such a technology-based campus, the cell phone reception is surprisingly poor, even when you're\noutdoors. Everywhere else in Boston is almost better.\n-\nI barely get reception on half of campus, and I get no reception on the other half. And I'm locked into the\ndeal with the cell phone company for another year, so I end up using my dorm phone a lot.\n-\nI guess I don't get reception everywhere, but it's no worse than anywhere outside MIT.\n-\nI LIVE IN SIMMONS AND RECEPTION SUCKS! You walk out in the hall, it goes away. in past years,\nif I moved in my chair I lost a phone call.\n-\nOverage charges are extremely high and reception isn't always great.\n-\nNone of my friends' phones get enough reception in my room and so I won't be able to call anyone from my\nroom even if I have a cell phone\n-\nSpotty in some buildings. Also cell phone service in general is not of the quality of a landline.\n-\nThere is bad reception in many dorms and most buildings on campus. Also, it is expensive\n-\nThere is very little signal in East Campus, near Bldgs 18, 56, 66, so in order to actually use my cellphone to\ncall home, which I do almost every day, I have to walk to the EC courtyard or walk on Mem Drive. I\nprefer to use my room phone to make most of my calls.\n-\nThere should be student discounts for Verizon and other cell phone services.\n-\nThey don't let you turn off service for a month.\n\nPage 24 of 47\n\nProject Randomize: VoIP Pilot Implementation at MIT\n\n6. List any complaints you have about dorm phone service here at MIT.\n\nResponse\nFrequency\nNone\nTelemarketers\n$17 fee\nNone, I don't use the phone\nNone, the service is good\n\nOther comments:\n-\n$17/month is more than I am willing to pay for just local service and incoming long distance, but\n$40/month is more than I am willing to pay for a cell phone. I see $10/month as about what I would pay for\nlocal phone. I also dislike rolling incoming long distance into the package to \"induce students to sign up,\"\nsince it feels like extortion -- I essentially *have* to sign up or buy a cell if my family wants to call me.\n-\nBad, I don't need it.\n-\nI do not have a working dorm telephone connection. I have a telephone, however no jack to plug it into. My\nphone number listed in the directory is actually the number of the person who lives in the next room over.\n-\nI don't know anything about it really, and I really wish I knew how everything worked out as far as what I\nmight need to do to be able to make long distance calls or receive voice mail, but I don't know where to\nlook for that info.\n-\nI don't want to pay next year. The service offered now meets my needs well\n-\nI get quite a lot of calls from solicitors, especially credit card companies. I also frequently come home to\nmessages on my machine that aren't messages, but just someone hanging up. I don't know where these\npeople get my phone number, because I don't give it out freely... I don't know if there's anything MIT can\ndo about it; maybe it's a lost cause. I also don't like the fact that if I didn't have a calling card, there would\nbe absolutely no way to call long distance. It's very frustrating once in a while when my card number\ntemporarily malfunctions, and I have no option-- not even an expensive one, not even an emergency \"Plan\nB\"-- for reaching my family (in CA) right away.\n-\nI lost my dial tone for a few days last semester, and it took a while for the people to come to fix it. Since it's\nthe only phone service I had access to, it was somewhat concerning.\n-\nI think the dorm phones are ok, though I wish caller ID were more available or cheaper.\n-\nI'm upset that we'll have to pay for it next year. A phone should come with the (high) cost of living in a\ndorm.\n-\nThere could be better displayed info about how to use the phone (example, dial 9-1-617...)\n-\nPersonally, my phone didn't work the first month I was here so my roommates and I gave up and just used\nour cell phones. Our dorm phone isn't even plugged in at this point.\n-\nThere is no operator to help you when you need help.\n-\nThey only provide local calls but most calls I need to make are outside of the 617 area code.\n-\nWe (myself +roomates) never started using it because the number we were told was ours was actually a\ncouple rooms down. Plus, we all had our own cell phones. But there was one drawback to only using our\n\nPage 25 of 47\n\nProject Randomize: VoIP Pilot Implementation at MIT\n\ncell phones--friends who did not own a cell phone could not call us because we all had long distance\nnumbers.\n-\nWell my hometown is in the 978 area code, and the dorm phones only cover 617 and 781 area codes. It's\nuseful that I can call in those area codes, but it's annoying that I live about a mile away from the 781 area\ncode line and I can't call home from my dorm phone; it's useless to buy phone service when I live that\nclose, so I have no choice but to use my cell phone to call home.\n-\nYou don't list the dorm phone numbers on the MIT search people page\n-\nYou have to dial 9-1-617 for local phone calls. The ringer on the phones given is super annoying. It makes\nme want to throw something.\n\n7. What are your thoughts about the planned $17/month fee for standard phone (local calling, voice mail) in\nthe dorm room next fall?\nStudent responses were consolidated and organized into the following general categories.\n\nI think it's a ridiculous or terrible idea.\n-\nI think it's an awful idea. At the very least we should be getting free local calls. Don't we already pay\nenough in tuition... and dorming fees... and housing tax? I don't use my phone that often - just to order in\nfood, or call someone else on campus. Don't take that away... then I WILL start going over my minutes on\nmy cell phone. And what about the people who don't have a cell phone? It is unreasonable to add on this\ncharge.\n-\nI think it's rather outrageous for IS&T to charge residents *more* money than they do already when the\ndormitory network is in such lousy condition. It is only 10 megabits, and often a poor quality connection. I\nregularly see packet loss.\n-\nI wouldn't like to have to pay so much money. Besides, it is safer for me and for all students to be able to\nuse the phone in case of an emergency.\n-\nI don't think that we should have to pay for phone service. Many comparable colleges do not make their\nstudents pay for phone service. It is bad enough that we already have to pay for cable service if we choose\nto have it(which many comparable colleges also do not make their students pay for). Many students already\npay at least $50 per month for cell phone service; now we have to pay an extra $17 for dorm phone service?\n-\nStudents should be guaranteed local phone service. Basic expectation that MIT should be able to fulfill\nwithout extra charge. Cell phones still are not universal.\n-\nI think it's ridiculous. MIT should provide free local phone service with housing, just as it provides other\nutilities such as water, electricity, and internet access. Phone service has been free for years, I see no\nreason why MIT should decide to change that.\n-\nTerrible idea. I use the local phones a lot. A lot of people get 617 area code cell phones just so we can use\ndorm phones to make these types of calls. I use the local phone to make phone calls about internships and\njobs.\n-\nAWFUL. Not only is it scalping but it's unreasonable considering how much we're paying for MIT as it is.\n-\nI think it's a bad idea. Having a dorm phone is important. For example if you have a phone interview or if\n\nPage 26 of 47\n\nProject Randomize: VoIP Pilot Implementation at MIT\n\nyou have to conduct any kind of business. It's not always appropriate to give everyone your cell phone.\nAlso I'm an officer in student groups so when I talk to corporate reps I give them my dorm phone number\nand not my cell phone. I think this looks more professional because you don't always have to keep worrying\nabout bad reception.\n\nI understand IS&T's point of view and reasoning\n-\nAt first I was upset by it, but I do think it's reasonable as long as we can still use it for inter-dorm and MIT\ncalling.\n-\nI don't like it. Phone service should come with the room. However, I do like the option they give us of not\nhaving one instead of incorporating it into the cost of the room.\n-\nProbably a prudent way to save money. i really like having the dorm phone, but a lot of people probably\ndon't use theirs and it was probably a smart decision\n-\nIf they then subtract that $17/month from the overall house bill (i.e. making it so those who use it come out\neven, those who dont save $) then it's ok\n-\nI am actually glad because now I won't get outside calls. I am glad that the phone will only be for on\ncampus calling cause I don't use it for local calling or voice mail. Now I won't get telemarketer calls.\n-\nGood, any dorm subsidies are bad.\n\nI won't be using my dorm phone.\n-\nAs long as its not mandatory I wouldn't mind because I don't use my dorm phone\n-\nDoesn't affect me, as I use my cell phone as my primary (and only!) phone\n\nI'm frustrated because I will need to use my dorm phone.\n-\nIt's awful, because I intend to be in a grad dorm next term.\n-\nI'm really frustrated, because I need to be able to make phone calls from some other place than my cell\nphone like when my cell phone is dead, or when I need to call someplace and I can't go outside to get\nreception cause my cell doesn't work inside my dorm. I feel like $17 is way too much for those services.\n-\nThat really sucks. I don't have voice-mail or anything, and I don't talk on my dorm phone- or any phone for\nthat matter, more than about 5 minutes a day. So it's really mean to make me have to pay, when I only use\nmy dorm phone on a need-to basis, and it's also the only dependable phone access I have.\n-\nI don't want to pay it. I'm also especially annoyed that we can't receive calls from the outside for free.\n-\nI think it really sucks. I use my dorm phone way more than my cellphone, and now on top of the phone\ncard expense I'll have the $17/month charge? I don't spend $17 on the phone card I use over three\nmonths! Someone in the administration should have cut something else out of the budget.\n-\nI'm adamantly against it, I need my dorm phone to make all local calls because my cell phone sometimes\ndoesn't get reception in my room, and it saves me minutes. Also, some of my friends don't have cell\nphones at they'd have no way of contacting me if we couldn't call local numbers on dorm phones.\n-\nI hate it. I resent that the administration just assumes that everyone on campus has a cell phone.\n\nPage 27 of 47\n\nProject Randomize: VoIP Pilot Implementation at MIT\n\n-\nI don't use the voice mail, but I feel that the local calling should be standard, I don't use the phone very\noften so paying $17/month would be pointless for my usage.\n-\nI think it is a horrible idea for those people w/o cell phones. I can't buy a cell phone, and even if i could, I\nidealogically would refuse to buy such a device due to its destruction and rude side affects.\n\nI do not like this plan because I mainly use my dorm phone for parental contact.\n-\nThe dorm phone is convenient because, in conjunction with a phone card, I can call family and friends in\nthe US and overseas.\n-\nWould be very sad. It is wonderful to have free local calling and incoming calls from home -- without the\nstatic we get on the cell phone.\n-\nIt's not cool, because it's my only local number, and it allows for my parents to call me without using up my\ncell phone minutes.\n-\nI use my phone MAYBE 1-2 hours a month. But, that service is necessary for my parents to call me, and\nfor me to use my phone card. Also, if the activation fee is initiated, will I be charged when I switch rooms\nin the dorm? Because for summer housing I'll live in a different room.\n-\nHate the idea. It would be okay if it didn't allow me to call out, but to have to pay it just to receive calls. I\nneed to get in touch with my parents, and it forced me to buy a cell phone plan, which is much more worth\nthe cost, which is not much more than $17 and can go anywhere.\n-\nVery unhappy. I use my dorm phone by having my parents call me on it.\n\nThe $17/month plan is too expensive.\n-\nI think it's a little steep and inconvenient for those who do use the phones here on campus as their only\nphone.\n-\nI like having the dorm room and my cell phone...I give most companies that I interviewed at my dorm\nnumber, it makes it easier to separate work and friends, and it also ensures that my connection does not cut-\nout in the middle of a call with a potential employer. The dorm room service is more reliable in the sense\nthat the signal will not fade and the quality of the sound is better. However, I don't think I would pay the\nnew $17 fee if i had the choice.\n-\n$17 per month is too much money. I definitely don't make that many local calls. I suppose if you didn't\ncharge it separately it would otherwise just end up hidden in our Bursar's bill, though, wouldn't it?\n-\nToo expensive, should at least be able to receive local calls for free. Certain delivery places need a 617\nnumber, and charging $17/month for those deliveries isn't worth it\n-\nExceptionally high. Definitely would not pay more than $6/month\n\nPage 28 of 47\n\nProject Randomize: VoIP Pilot Implementation at MIT\n\nEveryone has a cell phone and won't use the plan.\n-\nThey'll just use the Bexley desk phone, and charge MIT instead.\n-\nI don't think it should be issued. I know I would rather go over on my cell minutes than pay the $17 dollar\nfee bc it would be cheaper. However, this is bad because I use my dorm phone a lot. especially to make\nlocal calls and to 800 numbers.\n\nRandom comments & questions\n-\nMy room phone doesn't work.\n-\nBetter than charging me for rent. What about emergencies? Will I be able to get it should I need it in the\nmiddle of term for Boston Area contacts?\n-\nIf your cell phone doesn't work and your family needs to reach you in an emergency, they won't be able to\ncall your room phone. Also how can you call fraternities or FSILGs off-campus?\n\n8. Would you purchase the plan? Why or why not?\n\nResponse\nFrequency\nYes\n\nCommon comments\nFrequency\nNo other choice\nOther comments:\n-\nI am kinda forced to purchase this plan. I do not use my cell phone service freely for fear of high overage\ncharges. Therefore, any local calls that I need to make, I use my room phone, and so I will need this plan.\n-\nI mainly use the phone to make long distance calls back home on weekends, so I do not have a need for a\ncell phone. Getting a cell phone will turn out to be more expensive (than $17) for such long-dist usage.\n-\nI would have to for emergency situations at home. But I'd be angry about it.\n-\nMy location choices for placing cell phone calls are very limited, so I would still pay for the plan. Against\nmy will, but I would have to.\n-\nOnly by necessity. Phone service is a basic utility, and I don't have/want a cell phone.\n-\nThe plan is still cheaper than a cell phone. If companies offer a significant discount for MIT students, I\nmight get a cell phone instead.\n\nPage 29 of 47\n\nProject Randomize: VoIP Pilot Implementation at MIT\n\nResponse\nFrequency\nNo\n\nCommon comments\nFrequency\nDon't use dorm phone\n$17 fee too expensive\nBuy a cell phone\nIncrease use of my cell phone\n$17 fee too expensive for benefits\nI can't afford it\nUpgrade my cell phone plan\n\nOther comments:\n-\nI do not make local phone calls, nor do I need voicemail.\n-\nI don't use the phone enough for it to be worth $17, but if I have to choose I would rather get a cell phone\nand have the ability to make local AND long distance calls without having to get a long distance carrier and\npaying $17/month only for local calls.\n-\nI don't want to get telemarketer calls and I use my cell phone for everything else.\n-\nI have a cell phone. However, this fee may deter some people (who don't have cell phones) to not purchase\nthe standard package at all due to financial circumstances. I have heard a few comments about this and feel\nthis plan is very bad and dangerous for the overall well-being and safety of students.\n-\nI might just end up using my prepaid calling card. It would be cheaper.\n-\nI would still want to make local calls from a phone that is not my cell phone, but I would not purchase the\nplan in protest of its inanity.\n-\nMy friends have non-local #s, so the plan would be useless for me.\n-\nI only use dorm phones for campus calls\n-\nPerhaps if I were applying for internships or things in the Boston area.\n-\nWe would probably put the money towards a second cell phone (so that my husband and I each had one to\nuse).\n-\nThe plan is not mandatory.\n-\nGoing over on cell minutes would be cheaper.\n\nResponse\nFrequency\nMaybe\n\nPage 30 of 47\n\nProject Randomize: VoIP Pilot Implementation at MIT\n\nOther comments:\n-\nI would consider it or a cell. If I *could* make outgoing calls on my phone card without the plan, I might\nget by without it and just use the phone card for everything, since I make sufficiently less than $17/month\nworth of phone calls at $0.05/minute. My family would not be incredibly happy about not being able to\ncontact me by phone, but we would work something out.\n-\nI may just use my cell phone more.\n-\nDebatable. Again, cell phone is more worth the cost.\n\nResponse\nFrequency\nNo answer\n\n9.

Basically I highlight any number on my computer, hit F6 and it sets up the\ncall from my phone to the other person's phone.\nCoolness:\n\nAverage\n4.76\nStandard Deviation\n1.81\n\nValue Added:\nAverage\n3.85\nStandard Deviation\n2.04\n\nComments:\n-\nAlso extremely convenient\n-\nIt'll save me about 5 seconds, and well, those seconds matter.\n-\nIt's really not that hard to hand dial a number :)\n-\nBeing able to make calls directly from Google Local would be useful.\n-\nSeems useful...\n-\nActually, if you can just call through your computer and save the whole conversation as an audio file, that'd\nbe sweet.\n-\nAnytime I people search someone, calling them would require less effort.\n-\nNice utility, but not worth paying extra for\n\n18. I may be able to use my PDA or smartphone to call people from anywhere on campus that has wireless\naccess.\nCoolness:\n\nAverage\n4.45\nStandard Deviation\n2.15\n\nValue Added:\nAverage\n3.37\nStandard Deviation\n2.10\n\nComments:\n-\nNot many people have PDAs or smartphones.\n-\nDon't own a PDA or smartphone.\n-\nIf and only if there is wireless\n-\nI can't afford a PDA or smartphone\n-\nSmartphones are expensive, not-very-well-tested, and hard to find. PDAs are useless and expensive.\n-\nRight now, where there is wireless, there is usually a cell phone connection anyways.\n-\nCell phones are so ubiquitous it seems almost unnecessary.\n\nPage 35 of 47\n\nProject Randomize: VoIP Pilot Implementation at MIT\n\n-\nThis would be really useful. since I don't have a cell phone, the computer is the best way for me to stay\nconnected, and if I can use it to call people who only communicate by phone, all the better.\n\n19. VoIP service fails to work in a power outage or when a network is down.\nLevel of Inconvenience: 1 2\n\nNone\n\nVery Inconvenient\n\nAverage\n4.84\nStandard Deviation\n1.98\n\nComments:\n-\nJust like traditional phone service...\n-\nAt least I have a cellphone\n-\nNot that big of a deal, but still a disadvantage.\n-\nBut if power goes out, your regular phone would not work anyways.\n-\nThis Technology sounds cool and all, but I just want my phone. Also we need phones that work when the\npower goes out for emergence purposes.\n-\n\n20.

Well-designed protocols should\ndegrade intelligently.\n-\nDepending on how often\n-\nBeats static\n-\nIf the quality is bad, then I would definitely not want to use it, especially when my phone is just as good or\nbetter.\n-\nAs long as it doesn't cut out entirely. The main benefit of using a land line is because it's more clear.\n-\nIf transmission isn't clear all the time how is this technology much better than cell phones.\n\nPage 36 of 47\n\nProject Randomize: VoIP Pilot Implementation at MIT\n\nOverall comments:\n-\nAgain, you would need to convince me to use this service. for anything domestic, my cell phone rates are\nexcellent... i basically have unlimited minutes and free long distance. the only time i even considered using\nVOIP was to call overseas (while kyle was in spain). overall, i think i spent $150 in calling cards... we\nwere somewhat conservative with how long we spoke on the phone, but i still spent about $150 total on\ncalling cards. because of the amount of time we spent on the phone and the amount of time he was in\nspain, i still didn't switch. there's the switching cost to the consumer -> you have to convince me why this\nservice is much better and much cheaper AND also convince me to take the time to setup my system and\nbuy the components (ie: microphone) to use this service. i didn't want to go through the setup or buy a new\nmicrophone, and would rather have spent a little more on calling cards instead of going through the\ninconvenience of switching over.... so if you want people to use this service, that's something you need to\nconsider!\n-\nToo much computer stuff. phones work when electricity is out; cell phones too. that's when you need\nphones the most. Have a nice day.\n-\nBasically, I don't need all these fancy features, and what I do need my answering machine and my cell\nphone already do...I just want my local phone number for next year...\n-\nIf we're getting a VOIP system, it should work on Linux computers as well.\n-\nI use a VoIP to call home, and the problem I encounter is that the communication is choppy, and you can't\nhear an uninterrupted sentence. I guess it depends on the quality of the system.\n\nPage 37 of 47\n\nProject Randomize: VoIP Pilot Implementation at MIT\nAPPENDIX B: PRESENTATION SLIDES\n\nProject Randomize\nVoIP Implementation at MIT\nJohn Cloutier\nJennifer Peng\nAllison Dolan\nDirector, Telephony and IS&T Shared Services\nMay 6, 2005\n\nAgenda\n\nWhat is VoIP?\nProject Objectives/Overview\nScope\nFindings\nAnalysis\nRecommendations\nManagement Observations\nQ&A\n\nAgenda\nWhat is VoIP?\nWhat is VoIP?\nProject Objectives/Overview\nScope\nFindings\nAnalysis\nRecommendations\nManagement Observations\nQ&A\n\nPage 38 of 47\n\nProject Randomize: VoIP Pilot Implementation at MIT\n\nWhat is VoIP\n\nCalls made from\nComputer\nAnalog Phone\nCalls received by\nComputer\nAnalog Phone\nTransmitted over the\ninternet as well as\nanalog phone trunks\n\nAgenda\n\nWhat is VoIP?\nProject Objectives/Overview\nProject Objectives/Overview\nScope\nFindings\nAnalysis\nRecommendations\nManagement Observations\nQ&A\n\nProject Objectives/Overview\n\nWe're MIT, shouldn't we have VoIP?\nReasons to proceed with an installation\nObstacles that must be overcome\nInsight from other schools with VoIP\nSuggestion for best pilot program\n\nPage 39 of 47\n\nProject Randomize: VoIP Pilot Implementation at MIT\n\nAgenda\n\nWhat is VoIP?\nProject Objectives/Overview\nScope\nScope\nFindings\nAnalysis\nRecommendations\nManagement Observations\nQ&A\n\nScope\n\nConsiderations\nStudent/Administration need and openness\nPerspective from other universities with VoIP\nDepartmental interaction at MIT\nExisting infrastructure\nPossibility of a complete VoIP system in a\nnew/renovated building\nOutside Scope\nCost\nInvestigation of the technology\n\nAgenda\n\nWhat is VoIP?\nProject Objectives/Overview\nScope\nFindings\nFindings\nAnalysis\nRecommendations\nManagement Observations\nQ&A\n\nPage 40 of 47\n\nProject Randomize: VoIP Pilot Implementation at MIT\n\nFindings -

      "content": "Project Status Report\nTo:\nProf. C. Gibson, Allison Dolan, Evan Mamas\nFrom: John Cloutier, Jennifer Peng\nRe:\nProject Ramdomize VoIP status report\nDate: April 28, 2005\nIn the time since our last status report we have made significant strides. All of the\nprimary interviews with MIT administrators have been completed and we have collected\nand tabulated over 75 student surveys. The feedback we have gotten, both from students\nand stuff have significantly altered the conclusions we had expected. Our intended goal\nof devising a suitable suggestion for a pilot has given us insight into the process of\nnetwork and telephony interactions both at MIT and in the United States.\nAccomplishments\nJohn has completed interviews with Larry Lavine from Dartmouth and Jeff Schiller from\nMIT IS&T. Larry was able to describe the VoIP installation at Dartmouth as well as give\nsome insight into the transition from analog to VoIP on their campus. Most of the\ninformation he gave us had to do with the technical aspect of VoIP, both advancements in\nthe field as well as hurdles which have yet to be crossed.\n\nIn many respects, John's interview with Jeff was more meaningful in respect to the\ndirection of the final project. We had intended to ask Jeff about the network\ninfrastructure concerns of VoIP including how they factored into renovations, but instead\nwe got a better perspective of how facilities, IS&T and telephony at MIT works. As is\ntrue for many organizations, the interaction between various parts of a company have a\nprofound impact on how progress is made. Jeff gave us an interesting perspective on the\nevolution of the internet and telephone systems in the United States and how that is\ncontinuing to play a role in the adoption of this hybrid system of VoIP.\n\nJennifer interviewed Dennis Barron to get a better idea of what MIT is currently doing in\nthe area of integrated communication. Although his work has been fairly limited as far as\ndeployment, he is the foremost VoIP guru at MIT. Dennis shared with us the various\nhigh-tech features of VoIP. He is very much a techie who fell in love with VoIP because\nof its 'cool' factor. This added insight in fundamental to the push for VoIP and the\nconflict it has created. Established business administrators seems to be less interested in\nthe latest technology because they don't see much practical benefit from it. This insight\nwill draumatically effect our recommendations.\n\nWe have also collected and compiled student surveys to gauge interest in VoIP and on\nphone service at MIT in general. Student opinion was intended to be a primary driver of\nour recommendations.\n\nIssues\nAs we continue to compile our data and are beginning to formulate a recommendations,\nwe have been reminded of the human factor involved in this project. It would seem that\nthese is some degree of resistance from the various parties involved to endorse VoIP in\n\nfull force. From what we can gather, each party (facilities, IS and telephony) have\ndifferent approaches to communication services and don't always agree on a best course\nof action. This will have to be taken into consideration when presenting our findings so\nas not to step on anyone's toes.\n\nActions to be Taken\nData collections is nearing its completion. Now we turn to evaluating the information we\nhave and making some decisions on how to proceed. It seems very likely that the\nconclusion of our project will not be a suggestion of a particular dorm to begin a pilot,\nbut rather an evaluation of the current state of the program at MIT as a third party\nconsultant.\n\nOver the next two weeks we will be compiling our presentation for class as well as the\nfinal report. The presentation will describe what we have learned so far and will be\ngeared towards receiving input from the class on how to craft our final recommendation.\n\nReflections and Learning\nThe project as it stands now looks very different from the one we had originally planned\nto complete. Our proposal to find a suitable pilot location has shifted to an evaluation of\nthe landscape of MIT information services and how they work. It has been a great\nlearning experience to see how real businesses work (even at universities). The solution\nthat will best serve our project champion is not to pick a dorm where students will most\nlikely embrace VoIP, but rather to give an outsiders perspective on the way these\ndepartments are interacting and suggest possible ways to increase collaboration.\n\nEvery time we interview an administrator, we get a slightly different perspective on the\nissue and how to best solve it. VoIP is perhaps not unique in that it will require the\ncooperation of several different groups, and in the quickly changing world of IT these\ntypes of relationships are very important. Much like Barker University was able to\ndevelop a brand new system that integrated all parts of the university only to find that its\ncustomers didn't really want that, VoIP at MIT is suffering from a similar disconnect\nwithin its own organization. And, as with Barker, for this project to succeed, it will\nrequire the support of all parties involved."

IS&T Project Introduction\nBackground\nAs the academic year comes to an end, IS&T's goal of having wireless network connectivity in\nall indoor locations on campus, including but not limited to, dormitories, labs, as well as\nclassrooms, has almost been entirely realized. While IS&T took steps over the past two years\ntowards accomplishing this goal, they began to notice that quite a number of community\nmembers were accessing the MIT network via wireless signal bleeding from indoor access points\nto outdoor locations; people did not want to be constrained by the indoors when wanting to\naccess the Internet.\nThus a new vision for IS&T was born: an entirely wireless MIT campus, where wireless Internet\nconnectivity was available from one end of campus to the other, indoor as well as outdoor.\nObjective\nIS&T is quite aware that a complete campus-wide wireless connectivity implementation is quite\na laudable goal, and will indeed take some time. However, IS&T acknowledged that MIT needs\nto be on the forefront of technology and communications, and thus decided to begin with a pilot\nprogram to begin during the summer of 2005.\nFrom initial observations on IS&T's part combined with a dose of commonsense IS&T has\npicked three locations in which to deploy the pilot programs:\n- Student Center Steps and Surrounding Area\n- Killian Court\n- Stata Center Atrium and Surround Area\nBased on lessons learned from the pilot, IS&T plans to incrementally deploy wireless\nconnectivity in other outside key locations until every area on campus is covered. The speed at\nwhich this vision will be realized has yet to be determined, and will be heavily influenced by the\nsuccess of the pilot as well as feedback from the community.\nThe goal of an entirely wireless campus is to provide MIT community members the ability to\ncontinuously and consistently access the network through mobile devices such as laptops and\nPDAs as they move across campus. The ability to access the Internet anywhere on campus,\nwhether indoors and outdoors, not only increases flexibility in work style and improves\nefficiency, but allows computer users previously restricted to the indoors to get out and work in a\nmore healthy and open atmosphere: the great outdoors. This becomes even more important as\nwireless devices begin to proliferate the consumer market and become more important to the way\nwe work.\nDeliverables\nShort term: Pilot Plan, Summer of 2005\nLong-term: Campus-wide Implementation, September 2005 - ?\n\nII. Team Wireless Project Introduction\nBackground\nIn the Spring of 2005, student teams in the 15.568 Practical IT Management class were paired up\nwith current IS&T projects and asked to play a role in assisting the IS&T project. Team Wireless\nwas matched with IS&T's project for the implementation of outdoor wireless internet connection.\nThe Team met with Project Champion Theresa Regan, MIT's Director of Operations &\nInfrastructure Services, and discussed the scope and goals of this student project.\nObjective\nIS&T's large scale project involves numerous components. To better evaluate the situation and\nenvironment in which IS&T is launching outdoor wireless, it needs information from many ends,\nsuch as what kind of technology is available, which vendor is most appropriate for MIT, what\nkind of special environmental considerations (weather and architecture) do we need, etc.\nTeam Wireless' role is to address two of these areas. Specifically, we will provide IS&T with\nrelevant information regarding\n- The future of wireless technology\n- Other current outdoor wireless implementations\nTo accomplish this, we will conduct research on two ends\n- Outdoor Wireless Technology\no\nResearch outdoor wireless technology\no\nInterview vendors\n- Environment for Implementation\no\nInterview universities\nIS&T's Outdoor Wireless project wished to understand the future of outdoor wireless, such as\nwhich standards are used and what new technologies are being developed, so that upcoming\nimplementations would not soon become obsolete. We would gain understanding about future\ntechnology through academic research and through interviewing vendors on what they foresee on\nthe horizon.\nMany implementation issues can be planned for by observing other current outdoor wireless\nimplementations and learned from their experiences. Therefore, Team Wireless will interview\nother universities which have implemented outdoor wireless.\nWe will bring outside information to the inside without knowing the intimate details of IS&T's\nplans. We will add value to the IS&T project by informing and supplementing them with the\nresults of our research. The MIT Process Handbook aims to collect information on all different\ntypes of business processes so when one has questions regarding a specific kind of process, he\ncan look up that process and see how others have previously dealt with that process. Similarly,\nthe information we gather will serve as a base for IS&T so when they are implementing outdoor\n\nwireless, they can reference to our report and find useful information, such as what other\nuniversities chose for their vendors or how other universities solved problems regarding\narchitectural obstructions of signals.\nDeliverables\nDeliverable\nProject Plan\nStatus Report\nStatus Report\nStatus Report\nStatus Report\nProject Presentation\nFinal Written Report\n\nDue Date\nMarch 3, 2005\nMarch 17, 2005\nMarch 31, 2005\nApril 14, 2005\nApril 28, 2005\nMay 3, 2005\nMay 12, 2005\nThis final written report gathers all our findings and summarizes what we have accomplished\nwithin the timeframe provided for this project. We all provide many suggestions on where IS&T\nshould go from here, and what special considerations they need in moving forward.\nFor a more detailed timeline of our project, please refer to our Gantt chart in Appendix A. The\nGantt chart was adopted as recommended in Randolph and Posner's \"What Every Manager\nNeeds to Know about Project Management\".\n\nIII. Technology Overview\nWireless Basics\nWireless network connectivity has finally become main-stream and it is difficult these days to\npurchase a laptop that doesn't come equipped with the necessary hardware to harness the power\nof wireless. It is important to understand some of the basic concepts of how wireless works as\nwell as certain technological terms that are used throughout this report. Therefore, we are going\nto walk through a communication between an MIT student using a wireless laptop on the Student\nCenter steps and a professor using a desktop in his office, as illustrated in figure 1.\nHi\nProf!\nWired\nNetwork\n(Internet)\nHi\nProf!\nAccess p\nt\nptop\np\noin\nWireless La\nWired Deskto\nFigure 1: Wireless Basics\nThe student with the laptop attempts to send a message to his professor. First, the computer\nconverts the message to its digital format to be stored temporarily on the computer. Then, the\nwireless card in the laptop takes that digital information and converts it to a radio signal that is\nsent out into the air, the be picked up by the associated access point. This access point is\nconnected to the wired MIT network which is, in turn, connected to the rest of the internet.\nOnce the access point receives the signal sent from the laptop, it takes it and converts the radio\nsignal back into its digital form and sends it along to the appropriate switches on the network,\nwhich eventually makes its way to the professor's desktop computer.\nWireless Bridges\nAnother important wireless feature to understand is that of wireless bridges. Basically, wireless\nbridges allow a service provider to extend the range of a wireless signal by bouncing signals off\nof multiple access points configured to be wireless bridges.\n\nt\nLaptop\np\nAccess Poin\nWireless Bridge\nDeskto\nFigure 2: Wireless Bridges\nTo illustrate the use of wireless bridges, please refer to figure 2. Let's say that the student with\nthe wireless laptop is in the middle of Briggs field with his laptop, and the distance between his\nlaptop and the access point mounted on the outside of Simmons Hall is farther than the wireless\nsignal is able to travel. However, there is a wireless bridge in the middle of the field which is\nconfigured to take signals sent to it and send it out farther in certain directions, thus enabling a\nsignal from the laptop to reach the access point at Simmons and vice versa.\nWireless Standards\nToday, the most widely used standards are the 802.11a/b/g protocols. While a and g are the\nfaster protocols, b and g are interchangeable and are composed of cheaper hardware.\nAdditionally, the range on the b and g protocols are somewhat farther than the a protocol.\nCurrently, g is considered the gold standard, being the fastest most-widely used protocol\navailable today.\nFuture Wireless Technologies and Standards\nThere are a number of new protocols on the horizon. 802.16, also known as Wi-Max, is a\nprotocol that hopes to extend the distance of wireless signals to 10-20 miles, thus providing \"Last\nMile Broadband Connections\" to consumers who cannot connect to a wired solution for fast\nInternet connections. In the near future IS&T does not have to worry about this new technology\nmuch because the wired infrastructure is already implemented on campus and should be utilized\nto its fullest potential. However, in the far future the current wired infrastructure could become\nfully saturated, thus opening the doors to new technologies that provide additional bandwidth to\nusers on campus through other means than buried wires.\n\n802.11n is basically a step up from the 802.11g protocol, providing double the throughput.\nHowever, it operates on the 40 MHz Channel, which is restricted in countries such as Europe and\nJapan. Therefore, standard adoption is not likely in the coming years until these important\ncountries change their policies.\n802.11i is a wireless protocol that provides more secure wireless communications. At the present\ntime, all wireless implementations on campus are un-encrypted and therefore this protocol may\nnot be of much interest to IS&T. However, with the potential extension of wireless connectivity\nto public areas like Massachusetts Avenue and Kendal Square, IS&T might want to consider\nenhanced encrypted wireless communications with this new protocol.\n\nIV. Vendor Research\nProcedure\n1. Inquire Project Champion for MIT's current indoor wireless vendors\n2. Research on-line for outdoor wireless vendors\n3. Contact vendors with list of specific questions (phone & e-mail)\n4. Compile analyze results\n5. Make recommendation\nThe list of specific questions asked to vendors includes the following:\n- What solution do you offer for outdoor wireless internet access? What kind of access\npoints is used?\n- MIT's current wireless network has a central remote management system where\nindividual computer connections can be shut down from this central system if problems\narise. How will your access points be able to blend in with our current system?\n- What are some qualities that make you a strong candidate for MIT to choose as a\nvendor?\n- Do you have experience with implementing outdoor wireless internet on college\ncampuses?\n- What is your pricing and how does it compare to competitors?\n- What do you see as the future trend of outdoor wireless technology?\n\nInformation & Comparison\nVendors contacted:\nEnterasys, Avaya, smartBridges, D-Link, InPath Devices, National DataComm Corporation,\nLucent, Cisco, 3Com, Symbol, Proxim, NetGear, and Firetide\n* For contact information of these companies, please see References.\nEnterasys and Avaya are MIT's current vendors for indoor wireless. Unfortunately, Entersys'\noutdoor wireless solutions are discontinued, and we were unable to get in contact with Avaya.\nVendors who cooperated with the project:\nsmartBridges, D-Link, InPath Devices\nsmartBridges\nD-Link\nInPath Devices\nOutdoor Wireless\nairBridge and\nDWL-1700 AirPremier\nCPE 2473 Wireless\nSolution\nairPoint PRO series\nOutdoor 2.4 GHz\nBridge\nWireless Access Point\nPricing\n$350 each\n$820 each\n$379 each\nStandard Used\n802.11 b (new\n802.11 a/b/g\n802.11 b\nproduct coming out\nin May will have\n802.11 a/b/g)\nExperience with\nYes\nYes\nYes\nUniversities\nCompatible with\nYes\nYes\nYes\nMIT's Current\nWireless Network\nVendor\nKey Advantages\nD-Link\n-\nExtreme weather protection\n- built in heater and temperature sensor, Watertight Aluminum\nhousing, Lightning Protection, and PoE (Power Over Ethernet)\n-\nQuality name brand\n-\n128-bit WEP encryption\n-\nIEEE 802.1x port-based network access control with RADIUS servers for\nuser authentication\nInPath\n-\nEasy installation - integrated radio and antenna\n-\nLow price - Cisco uses same OEM but much more expensive\nsmartBridges\n-\nExperience in all areas (Low power, commercial, wide areas, high\nhumidity, below zero temperatures, outside city limits, revenue\ngeneration, residential)\n-\nRemote management system\n-\nSupports VoIP\n\nVendor Recommendation\nAs Team Wireless was only able to receive full response from 3 vendors, we are still in an early\nphase of evaluating vendors; therefore, we cannot tell IS&T exactly which vendor to work with.\nHowever, of the 3 vendors, we can draw a preliminary conclusion of which vendor we would\nprefer out of these three.\nWeather\nduration\nFuture\nTrends\nExperience in\nwith MIT\nAdvanced\ntechnology\ninstallation\nCompatibility\nLower price range\nHigher price range\nD-Link\nsmartBridges\nConsidering future trends of technology, compatibility with MIT, weather duration, experience\nin installation, and advanced technology, we recommend that\n1) If MIT is aiming for a lower price range and looking for a more economical solution,\nto work with smartBridges, and\n2) If MIT is fine with a higher price range and wants to go with a more established and\nmore brand-name vendor, to work with D-Link.\n\nNext Steps for Vendor Research\n- Interview more vendors\no Speaking with vendors can help better understand options for technology and\nsupport.\no As a student project group, we had limited contacts. We are confident that\nvendors would be much more willing to work with MIT's IS&T.\n- Allow vendors to evaluate MIT's specific circumstances\no When speaking to vendors, they often asked specific questions about MIT's\ncurrent systems and environment. By allowing vendors to identify unique\nattributes of MIT, IS&T will be able to evaluate how vendors will handle these\ncircumstances.\n- Bring vendors on campus to give price quotes\no This will allow IS&T to conduct a price-benefit analysis on different vendors.\no Bringing the vendors on campus to present their best solution and bid for the\nproject will hopefully make it more cost-efficient for MIT.\n- Research retail channels\no Certain vendors actually use retailers to sell their products.\no IS&T should evaluate purchasing options and see which channel will provide the\nbest future support, since IS&T is relying on the vendor to provide future support\nand maintenance of the outdoor wireless.\n\nV. University Research\nProcedure\n1. Research on-line for universities with outdoor wireless technologies\n2. Contact universities through email correspondence with a list of specific questions\n3. Compile and display information\n4. Make preliminary recommendations\n5. Suggest next steps\nSince IS&T would use our research on universities as a reference to MIT's outdoor wireless\nimplementation, we thought the most relevant questions would fit under the following three\ncategories: vendor selection, implementation process, and other considerations. All of the\nquestions were derived from the interests of our Project Champion.\n- Vendor Selection\no Whom did you choose as your vendor?\no What criteria did you set forth in order to select the vendor?\n- Implementation Process\no What is the outdoor wireless infrastructure of your campus?\no How long did the implementation take?\no What were some of the implementation problems you experienced, if any?\no How has the weather affected outdoor wireless functionality\no How did you take into account structural interference?\n- Other Considerations\no Are there items you wish you knew before you started the implementation?\no How does the university cope with visitors on campus who use the wireless\ntechnology?\nDue to time and resource constraints, we used a static email interview structure. The information\ncollected from the interviews can give IS&T a snapshot into how other universities use their\ntechnology. For a deeper information, personal or phone interviews should be conducted in the\nfuture to obtain more specific information that could be relevant to MIT's implementation.\n\nInformation & Comparison\nTeam Wireless contacted seventeen universities through email asking questions ranging from\nvendor selection to infrastructure set-up. Our team tried to specifically research universities in\nthe Boston and northeast area in order to understand how others dealt with similar weather and\ncampus challenges. Unfortunately, the only universities we could find are similar to MIT\nexternally (weather conditions) and internally (integrated campus and city) were Carnegie\nMellon University, Columbia University, University of Pennsylvania, and University of\nPittsburgh. In general, the locations of outdoor wireless campuses are sporadic in geographic\nlocation. Since we could find limited amount of universities that have implemented this\ntechnology, team wireless believes that MIT would still be a pioneer in this technological\nmovement.\nUniversities Contacted\nBowling Green State University, Carnegie Mellon University, Central Washington University,\nColumbia University, Drew University, Georgia Institute of Technology, Goucher University,\nFlorida A&M University, Louisiana State University, University of Arkansas, University of\nCalifornia , Irvine, University of Iowa, University of Nevada, Reno, University of Pennsylvania,\nUniversity of Pittsburgh, University of South Carolina, and University of Virginia\n*For contact information of these universities, please see References.\nUniversities who cooperated with the project:\nCarnegie Mellon University, Columbia University, Georgia Institute of Technology, Louisiana\nState University, and University of Virginia\nThe following chart aggregates the important university data.\nUniversity\nVendor\nInfrastructure\nWeather Visitor Policy\nCarnegie Mellon\nAT&T\nInternal Bleeding + Irrelevant Guest Registration: access to\nUniversity\n(currently Proxim) External Antennas\nonly internet\nColumbia\nLucent\nExternal Antennas\nIrrelevant Guest Registration: access to\nUniversity\n(currently Proxim)\nonly internet\nGeorgia Institute\nDigital Atlantic\nOutdoor Switches\nIrrelevant No non-authenticated wireless\nof Technology\n(currently Proxim)\nnetworks\nLouisiana State\nUniversity\nCisco\nExternal Antennas\nNone\nGuest Registration: access to\nonly internet\nUniversity of\nVirginia\nCisco Aironet\nBridge Antennas\nNone\nNo non-authenticated wireless\nnetworks\n\nVendor\nEach university chose a different vendor at the time of purchase. Each university identified\npotential vendors and worked together to devise customized solutions for its campus. We\nrecommend that MIT follow a similar procedure for vendor selection.\n* Refer to the Vendor Research section for more information.\nInfrastructure\nThe three main technologies that the universities currently have in place are external antennas,\nbridge antennas, and outdoor switches. The universities stressed how the coverage landscape\ndictates the type of technology needed. For example, a large open field (ie Briggs Field) needs to\nbe covered by bridge antennas in order for the signal to reach across the open space. The\ncollaboration between the vendor and university will determine the appropriate technology for a\ngiven space.\nWeather\nSince the ferocious winter months inhabit Boston for most of the year, IS&T was wondering how\nweather may affect the wireless signal. Fortunately, most universities found no signal\ndegradation or irrelevant signal degradation due to the weather. In stormy weather conditions,\nusually there aren't any individuals who are trying to access wireless outdoors.\nVisitor Policy\nUniversities mainly followed two visitor policies. Georgia Institute of Technology and\nUniversity of Virginia require that wireless users must register with the school. The other\nuniversities as well as MIT have a guest registration option. Specifically, MIT allows visitor use\nfor up to fourteen consecutive days. Team wireless believes that the current policy should remain\nfor outdoor wireless as well. The policy is flexible for individuals who stay temporarily on\ncampus as guests of MIT. At the same time, the policy is secure because visitors only have\naccess to the internet and not to user/password information.\nThe universities also shared their knowledge from the implementation of their outdoor wireless.\nThe chart below displays an array of diverse implementation problems and solutions to structural\ninterference.\n\nUniversity\nUniversity\nUniversity\nDesign around potential\nobstacles\nGeorgia Institute\nof Technology\nAntennas on historical buildings\nNone\nUniversity\nNone\nAdd another antenna\nVirginia\nAntennas on historical buildings\nPower up APs\nAdd another antenna\nImplementation Problems\nSolutions to Solutions to\nStructural Interference\nCarnegie Mellon Limited RF available in the 2.4 Ghz band\nTrial & error AP placement\nColumbia\nLimited RF available in the 2.4 Ghz band\nMistakenly experimented with new technology\nLouisiana State\nUniversity of\nRelocate APs\nImplementation Problems\n- Limited RF available in the 2.4 Ghz band:\nAt the 2.4 Gz band, microwaves, cordless phones, and Bluetooth devices cause\ninterference. The universities overcame such problems with strategic placement of\naccess points and the use of multiple access points.\n- Mistakenly experimented with new technology:\nGeorgia Institute of Technology experimented with new technology from Digital Atlantic\nto cut costs and avoid laying down hard-wired ethernet. They set up the infrastructure,\nbut the actual wireless internet did not work and the company went under. In the end,\nGeorgia Institute of Technology had remove Digital Atlantic's work and set up the hard-\nwired ethernet.\n- Antennas on historical buildings:\nGeorgia Institute of Technology had a problem with putting antennas on the steep roofs\nof their historical buildings, so they put a switch on top of their library to cover the whole\narea. In addition, historical buildings have restrictions on installing such devices. MIT\nmight run into this issue further down the road with the campus-wide installation when\ncovering areas by the Alumni Pool and Lobby 10.\nSolutions to Structural Interference\n- Trial & error AP placement:\nCarnegie Mellon University used a method of placing access point at an opposite end as\nthe rest of the access points and then moving it closer to the rest until it leaves no\ncoverage gaps. With the additional access point, they repeated the process.\n- Design around potential obstacles:\n\nAs stated above, Georgia Institute of Technology had a problem with putting antennas on\nthe steep roofs of their historical buildings, so they put a switch on top of their library to\ncover the whole area.\n- Relocate access points:\nThe access points can be moved to increase performance level. The optimal method is\nthe trail & error process.\n- Power up access points:\nThe strength and coverage area can be changed to accommodate structural interference.\n- Add another antenna:\nLouisiana State University implementation plan was to set up additional antennas when\nand where they are needed.\nMany of the issues seen at the other universities look as though they might also be problems that\nmay arise at MIT. It would be useful to talk to the universities beforehand to have some scenario\nplanning (Class 12 discussion on March 15: CareGroup). This will allow IS&T to prevent these\nissues from coming up or at least know how to handle the problems that may arise during the\nimplementation.\n\nPreliminary Recommendations\nFrom the information we received, Team Wireless has developed several recommendations that\nMIT should consider when rolling out the Pilot Program in June.\nInstall access points out of sight\nAccess points can be easily stolen or damaged if exposed to human contact. Placing access\npoints out of sight would lengthen the life of access points.\nDeploy 802.11g technology if possible\nProtocol 802.11g is currently the fastest, most widely used protocol. For the future, team wireless\nbelieves that .11g will be the pervasive protocol for outdoor wireless. Additionally, the indoor\nwireless protocol is .11g; therefore, choosing .11g would maintain signal consistency from\nindoors to outdoors.\nCreate site surveys\nPlanning for access point coverage for the desired location is imperative in order to maximize the\nsignal given potential obstructions. Creating site surveys will ensure effective access point\nplacement and limit the trial and error process.\nTest access points by trial and error\nSince each area is unique, the only way to get the best layout of access points is with the process\nof trial and error. Carnegie Mellon University used a method of placing access point at an\nopposite end as the rest of the access points and then moving it closer to the rest until it leaves no\ncoverage gaps. With the additional access point, they repeated the process.\nAdd up to three access points for one area\nFor a given location, up to three access points should be used depending on interference types.\nAfter installing three access points, the 2.4 GHz channel becomes oversaturated and each\nadditional access point yields diminishing marginal returns to the signal.\nUse stable and flexible technology\nThis point of advice is to reiterate common sense. Even though Team Wireless has done its best\nto forecast some technological trends, there could be new enhancements or other technological\nadvances that we may have overlooked. As such, IS&T should adopt flexible technology that can\neasily be modified to include upcoming technology.\n\nNext Steps for University Research\nInterview more universities regarding MIT's specifics\nDue to time and resource constraints, the static email interview structure can give IS&T a\nsnapshot into how other universities use their technology. However, more research dynamic (ie\npersonal or phone interviews) should be conducted in the future to obtain more specific\ninformation that could be relevant to MIT's implementation and gather details on concerns\nexposed in initial research. In addition, as a student project group, we had limited contacts. From\nthe comments we received during our final presentation, we are confident that vendors would be\nmuch more willing to speak to MIT's IS&T. Since more research can always be helpful, IS&T\nshould just limit itself to speaking to the five universities we interviewed in more detail in\naddition to speaking to any schools with a similar landscape and climate (ie University of\nPennsylvania).\nGather special circumstances of implementation areas\nMultiple universities stated that each area was unique and thus would have to have a custom\naccess point layout as a result of interference (ie whiteboards, concrete buildings, and water) and\narea characteristics (ie how level the land is and estimated usage). Once the information is\ngathered, IS&T should talk to the vendors regarding how we can overcome each problem. It\nmay be beneficial to start this early because of our unique architecture.\nUnderstand future funding for upgrades\nDepending on IS&Ts future plans and options going to be available in the future, IS&T has to\nweigh the advantages and disadvantages of upgrading later versus repairing new technology\nglitches that come up from using new technologies now. For example, Georgia Institute of\nTechnology experimented with new technology from Digital. They set up the infrastructure, but\nthe actual wireless internet did not work and the company went under. In the end, Georgia\nInstitute of Technology had reverted back to the stable technology but with time and resources\nlost. MIT might face similar pressure to be at the leading edge, but it might be less risky for MIT\nto go with a more flexible plan such as Louisiana State University. They have an ongoing\nimplementation process where they add access points when they see a need for it.\nThe university research done by our team is a good general stepping stone for MIT's IS&T to\nbuild off of. With the given information in the report, we hope to give IS&T some points to\nfocus on when moving forward with their outdoor wireless implementation.\n\nVI. Future Considerations for IS&T\nDHCP Lease Visitor Policy\nIS&T's current policy on leasing IPs to visitors on campus is to provide them full access to the\nnetwork for 14 days per a given year. This policy may have worked when wireless access was\nrestricted to indoors, but once wireless is available outdoors, especially near public areas like\nMassachusetts Avenue and the Kendall T Station, the MIT network will most likely receive a\nnumber of additional wireless connections from non-MIT community members.\nAlthough IS&T has implemented an extensive remote management system for wireless Access\nPoints and DHCP leases which enables them to deny access to specific machines connected to\nthe network, the increase in visitors may drastically increase the load on the remote management\nsystem. Instead of bolstering the remote management system, IS&T may want to consider\nrevising their Visitor policy, by:\n- Reducing the amount of time a visitor has access\n- Implement a more extensive registration process\n- Limit visitors to certain ports (i.e. only allow them to browse the web)\n- Monitor visitor connections more closely\nPilot Program Success Metrics\nAlthough this question is a bit out of the scope of our project, it is important to evaluate the\nsuccess of the three pilot locations for outdoor wireless deployment. One obvious way is to\nmeasure the load on the newly deployed access points. If these access points are well saturated,\nthen the locations chosen were good ones.\nAnother means of determining whether the pilot program is a success is by conducting surveys\nbefore and after the deployment of the outside wireless locations gauging the satisfaction of\ncommunity members with wireless connectivity. Additionally, it would be useful to see what\npercentage of the community is aware of the outdoor wireless availability a couple of months\nafter deployment.\nIdentifying Key Outdoor Locations\nIS&T must make a serious effort in determining the ideal locations for outdoor wireless and\nprioritize them. In determining the pilot locations, IS&T simply observed where people were\nusing bleeding signals. For future locations, we recommend that IS&T survey the community for\noutdoor locations where they would find wireless access useful. IS&T should take into\nconsideration:\n- Places to sit\n- Shade (most laptop screens become extremely washed out in the sun)\n- Power outlets (batteries only last for so long)\n\nBuilding Interference\nThere are a number of very unique buildings around MIT made out of special materials, such as\nSimmons and Stata. IS&T must figure out what affect unique building materials have on signal\nstrength and interference, and can look at the experiences of other universities who deployed\noutdoors.\nFuture Technologies\nIS&T must always be wary of future technologies that could have a profound impact on their\noutdoor wireless implementation, such as the introduction of new protocols that may be widely\nadopted. Additionally, IS&T must pay attention to the increased proliferation of wireless devices\nin the form of wirelessly enabled PDAs and handhelds. In the future, there may be hundreds of\npeople with wireless handhelds passing by access points at one time; what affect will this have\nthe wireless network? IS&T should also take advantage of the convergence of technologies, such\nas the advent of wireless Voice over IP (VoIP) equipment in the past couple months.\n\nVII. Lessons Learned\nThe Outdoor Wireless Team enjoyed working on this project for IS&T. The project allowed us\nto apply what we learned in class, such as the use of Gantt Charts to keep track of deadline and\nthe use of status signals. We also really appreciated the very important people such as Steve\nWinig were supportive and interested in our project. It made us feel as though they were really\nlistening and that our work would be useful to them. However, work equivalent to the work\nbefore the project on top of status reports and other deliverables made it hard for the team to\nfocus on the project.\nMaintain clear\nconsistent\ncommunication\nTeam Wireless'\nPyramid to IT\nProject Management\nSuccess\nWork\nPlan for more\ndata collection\nbackwards\nthan needed\nfrom a set goal\nMaintain clear consistent communication\nIt is extremely important to have proper communication between team members and with others\ninvolved in the project. As a team, we communicated well and thus we were all on the same\ntrack. However, we were not able to meet with a key stakeholder in the project and so for a little\nbit we were not able to move forward. Nevertheless, after meeting with the stakeholder, we were\nable to make up the time we lost.\nPlan for more data collection than needed\nOut of the fourteen vendors contacted and seventeen universities contacted, we only received\ninformation from three vendors and five universities. In addition, since the schools do not know\nwhat is pertinent to MIT, we had to filter out a lot of data. We did not plan for such a small\nresponse rate. In the beginning, we only contacted a few expecting responses from most of them.\nBut after seeing our response rate, we contacted more vendors and universities. If we had know\nthis and planned accordingly to gather the information earlier, we might have been able to follow\nup with additional questions to gather specifics regarding their responses.\n\nWork backwards from a set goal\nAs Professor Gibson mentioned in class, it is important to figure out what you want in the\ndeliverables and then work backwards to get the results you need. We did not do this initially.\nAfter out initial presentation, our team met to figure out what we wanted as our end result. If\nthis was a larger project, a useful tool in measuring performance would be the Balanced\nScorecard. It's \"a set of measures that gives top managers a fast but comprehensive view of the\nbusiness\" in four perspectives: financial, customer, internal business, and innovation and\nlearning as stated in \"The Balanced Scorecard - Measures that Drive Performance\" by Robert S.\nKaplan and David P. Norton..\n\nVIII.

      "content": "Outdoor Wireless at MIT\n\nRevised Project Plan\n3/10/2005\n\nTeam Wireless\nJanice Lin, Jessica So, Ashvini Thammaiah, Harel Williams\n\nProject Plan Outline\n\nI Context for the Project\n\nIn recent years, MIT has endeavored to support a wireless campus. The IS&T division has met\nwith success in the indoor wireless environment and is now looking to expand wireless\navailability to outdoors. Teresa Regan, Vice President for Information Services and\nTechnology, communicated to our team the reasons for having an outdoor wireless system.\nOne of the motivations is to provide additional locations where students can gather for social\nand academic purposes. In addition, IS&T would like to make the wireless connectivity\nconsistent throughout campus.\n\nThe objective is to implement a pilot program by the end of the summer that provides\noutdoor wireless in the following three areas: Stratton Student Center, Stata Center, and\nKillian Court. Pending the success of the pilot program, IS&T will provide wireless internet\nfor all other MIT outdoor locations.\n\nConsidering the scale of this project, there are various uncertainties regarding the technology\nand environment. Specifically for technology, IS&T would like to understand the future\noutdoor wireless market and the corresponding technological advances. Environmentally,\nconcerns include durability under weather conditions, structural interference of wireless\nsignal, and ease of construction with aesthetics in mind. IS&T is also uncertain of their\nvendor preference.\n\nII Purpose, Objectives and Approach of the 15.568 Wireless Team Project\n\nPurpose:\n\nWe plan to provide IS&T with relevant information regarding the future of wireless\ntechnology and examples of other current outdoor wireless implementations. This\ninformation will help IS&T make more informed decisions for their pilot program.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo address the technology concerns, we will first conduct preliminary research on available\noutdoor wireless technology. Secondly, we will interview vendor personnel to understand the\nevolving wireless technology market and how its direction affects our technology choice.\n\nWith regards to the environmental concerns, we will interview other universities and ISP\ncompanies with outdoor wireless internet. From these interviews, we hope to uncover their\nsolutions to implementation problems, their criteria for selecting vendors, and their process\nof implementing the infrastructure. Finally, if there is enough time, our team would like to\ncollect some qualitative data regarding campus sentiment on the outdoor wireless initiative.\n\nIII Tasks, Milestones, and Deliverables\n\nTask\nOwner\nHours\nDue\nDate\nResults\n\nPlan development and approval\n\nProject plan\n\nSubmit project plan to Professor and TA\nAll\n8-Mar\n\nRevise project plan\nAll\n8-Mar\n\nLiterature or document search and review\n\nUnderstanding of wireless technology\nand what vendors and schools are\ndoing\n\nOnline research for wireless technology\nand talk to IS&T about remote access to\nwireless docks\nHarel\n15-Mar\n\nVendors research\nJanice\n15-Mar\n\nUniversities research\nAshvini, Jessica\n15-Mar\n\nField data gathering (such as interviews in\nperson or by phone, survey by phone or\nquestionaire, etc.)\n\nInsights from vendors, ISPs, and\nschools on outdoor wireless\ntechnology implementation\n\nVendors research\nJanice\n5-Apr\n\nUniversities research\nAshvini, Jessica\n5-Apr\n\nISPs\nHarel\n5-Apr\n\nAnalysis and preliminary conclusions\n\nWrite-up on findings and use them to\nanswer our objectives\n\nVendors\nAll\n12-Apr\n\nUniversities\nAll\n12-Apr\n\nPresentation by team (must include the\nrepresentative from the organization, either in\nperson or via video or teleconference)\n\nPowerPoint presentations\n\nPreliminary presentation to stakeholders\n(IS&T)\nAll\n21-Apr\n\nRevised and final presentation\nAll\n28-Apr\n\nFinal report (include outline of report)\n\nComplete 20-page final report\n\nComplete report on final conclusion to\nMIT IS&T\nAll\n10-May\n\nIV Uncertainties, Risks and Opportunities, and Planned Responses\n\n(Scale 1-3)\n(Scale 1-3) (Prob * Impact)\n#\nCondition\nConsequence\nProbability\nImpact\nExposure\nMitigation\nContingency\nTriggers\nTeam members are overloaded\nPoor Project Delivery\nWeekly Meetings, Frequent Email\nContact, Good Scheduling Practices\nRedistribute tasks, Narrow Focus of\nProject, Redefine Objectives\nMIT is difficult, Project scope\nbecomes too large\nVendors, ISPs, Colleges are unwilling\nto share information\nLack of information to provide to\nIS&T\nUse personal contacts of IS&T, Use MIT\nname, Use student government angle\nChange our objective to focus on\ninformation available\nUnproffesional communication,\nConfidentiality Issues, Conflict of\ninterest to vendors\nTeam Member Conflicts/Internal\nProblems\nTeam atmosphere/moral degrades,\nSlow in project development\nShorter, more frequent meetings, informal\nhang out time\nIntervention, team counseling\nsessions\nToo much time together, Stress\nIS&T does not like presentation/report Our impact is minimal\nUpdate regularly with champion,\ndynamically adjust project to feedback\nCreate a post mortem for our\nfindings and include\nrecommendations for further\nresearch\nPoor communication between\nchampion and group\nRisk Statement\n\nV Critical Success Factors\n\nCondition\nConsequence\nAssurance\nContingency\nAccess to interviews with relevant persons\nRelevant and effective information for our\nproject's objectives\nTenacious, professional, and efficient in our\ncontact methodology\nGo through a third party (IS&T, Prof. Gibson)\nto find personal contacts\nTeam Member Dedication\nExcellent teamwork, efficient meetings\nBuild team moral, Hang out together outside\nof project, Address personal conflicts\nimmediately\nDivide up the project milestones so that team\nmembers can work separately\nBasic knowledge of underlying technology\nBetter understanding of IS&T's needs\nAll members of team spend time learning the\nunderlying technology\nDepend on computer science major to\nunderstand and explain technology\nAccess to IS&T's data on current\nimplementation and their plans for the future\nBetter recommendations for integration\nMeet with IS&T representatives effectively\nand often to learn about current infrastructure\nProvide a higher level view of possible project\nimplementations\nSuccess Statement\n\nVI Gantt Chart"

      "content": "_____________________\nPrepared for class discussion in 15.568, Practical IT Management, Sloan School of Management, MIT, by\nCyrus Gibson and Evan Mamas.\n(c) Massachusetts Institute of Technology 2005 February 1, 2005\nOn the Spot at Dynamix Enterprises\n\nAs a new employee of Dynamix Enterprises, you have been asked by your boss, Marv Dillon, the\nChief Operating Officer, to help him respond to an issue of contention between the president of\nthe largest division, of the company, Dyninvest, and the Chief Information Officer of Dynamix.\n\nDynamix is a diversified financial services company which has grown by acquisition from its\ncore business, an old New England bank. Of the eight operating divisions, six are virtually intact\nfrom when acquired, including Dyininvest, the second largest division and fourth most profitable.\nAll division presidents report to your boss Dillon, the COO. Businesses include an investment\nbank, consumer financial investment and money management (Dyninvest), and several on-line\ninformation services to particular industries. Dynamix is publicly traded, had 2004 revenues of\n$2.5 billion, and has experienced an average of over 15% growth in recent years. Profitability\nhas lagged, largely as a result of the unanticipated heavy costs of integrating information\ntechnology infrastructure to achieve expected efficiencies. The stock price has lagged the index of\nthe financial industry.\n\nIn October, 2004, the president of the Dyninvest division, Elaine Rodriguez, submitted a proposal\nto the CIO of Dynamix, Geof Chang, for the urgent purchase of a vendor customer information\nmanagement (CIM) system package from the vendor Seibel. The submission was part of the\nannual budgeting process which required all divisions to get their IT investments and operating\ncosts reviewed and approved by Chang and his staff before they spent divisional funds or\nallocated corporate funds. The request for Seibel was the only new system request from the\ndivision for that annual cycle. It amounted to $1.75 million in purchase and implementation\ncosts, all of which would come from the Dyninvest division's budget. Dynamix's IT budget was\n$425 million a year. Approximately 30% of that was from corporate funds, spent either centrally\non company-wide infrastructure or allocated to divisions for applications which could benefit\nmore than one division.\n\nThis morning your boss Dillon received an angry phone call from Rodriguez, who had just\nreceived an email from Chang. The email informed her that the request for the CIM package was\nbeing reviewed in light of a previous plan, approved by the corporate IT steering committee in\nJune, 2004, for $10 million over 18 months, to consolidate customer information across most\ndivisions, to move to a web-services architecture that would employ plug-and-play applications\nlike \"Salesforce.com\", and that Seibel was not a preferred vendor. Rodriguez had told Dillon,\n\"There is no way we can meet our sales targets in 2005 without the new system. We are being\nbeaten by the competition in enlisting banks, financial advisors, and estate planners, our key\nchannels to the consumer, in selling our mutual funds and index funds, and it is because we don't\nsupport our staff with information. Many competitors use Seibel, and we need it now.\" Dillon,\nas a member of the corporate IT steering committee along with other direct reports to the CEO of\nDynamix, including CIO Chang, knew about the approved web services strategy but appreciated\nthat Dyninvest was under pressure to increase sales.\n\nAs he gives you the assignment, Dillon says, \"What should I do here? I know you are new to\nDynamix, so if you have any other questions or a way to think about this, start with that. But you\nand I need to have an approach this afternoon. I'm meeting with Rodriguez and Chang at four\npm.\""

      "content": "AIRNow:\nArming the Public with Air Quality Data\nNovember 2003, revised March 2004\nThe amazing thing about this project is that state participation is voluntary\nand yet all of the states with an ozone problem have embraced it. I haven't\nheard of many government programs that are voluntary and successful. The\nsuccess of the program is a testament to Chet Wayland's quiet but effective\nleadership.\n- Phil Dickerson, EPA Environmental Engineer\nIn June 2003, Chet Wayland, manager of the EPA Office of Air Quality Planning\nand Standards AIRNow Program, reflected on the progress AIRNow had made.\nSince picking up the gauntlet in 1998, Wayland's AIRNow project had grown to\nprovide the public in 45 states and 276 metropolitan areas with up-to-the-minute\nozone air quality data and one- to three-day forecasts. Although participation in\nthe program was voluntary, air quality engineers across US state and county\ngovernments, national parks, and parts of Canada and Mexico pooled their data\nevery hour to produce color-coded maps (see Exhibit 1). People with asthma or\nheart problems, young children, or those with regular exercise regimens could\ntell at a glance when to shift their activities indoors. Unlike the EPA's official air\nquality statistics, AIRNow maps and forecasts were readily available on the web,\nThe Weather Channel, and in USAToday.\nSince 1976, the EPA had required states to report ozone levels quarterly. This\ndata was carefully collected, stored in the EPA data center, and used mainly to\nevaluate whether states were in compliance with federally mandated air quality\nstandards. Phil Dickerson, EPA Environmental engineer, noted that since the\ndata was processed and stored in a mainframe environment, \"It was difficult for\nthe public to get ahold of the data - they had to do a Freedom of Information Act\n(FOIA) request. And the data that we sent to them was hard to interpret.\" As a\nresult, most citizens remained uninformed about ozone in their cities and\nneighborhoods, even when it reached potentially hazardous levels.\nThe AIRNow program completely changed the public's ozone awareness. It\nbrought air quality information out of the glass house and put it in citizens'\nThis case was prepared by Professor Donna Stoddard chair of Babson College's\nInformation Management Division and Dr. Jane Linder director of research at the\nAccenture Institute for High Performance Business, with the assistance of Steven\nPowers, research associate. Funding was provided by the National Science Foundation\nprogram for digital government.\n\nliving rooms. , According to Lewis Weinstock, an air quality forecaster for\nForsyth County, North Carolina, the AIRNow initiative significantly changed his\nrole. He noted, \"I manage an air quality monitoring group for a local agency in\nWinston-Salem. We are an analysis and monitoring section. We measure\npollutants for the Clean Air Act. To put our group into context, the EPA sets\nexpectations for maintaining ozone standards, but most air quality monitoring\nwork is delegated out to state and local agencies.\" Weinstock continued,\nWe have a county of over 300,000 people, and North Carolina has a lot\nof air quality problems. Prior to AIRNow, we didn't interact much\nwith the public; we saw our role as taking numbers and reporting\nthem to the state and federal government. As the Internet grew and\npeople's interest in air quality grew, everyone recognized there was\nmuch more immediacy to the data and value to the public. We used to\ntell them six months later what they shouldn't have been doing on a\nparticular day because of air quality conditions. Now we tell them\nthree days ahead of time.\nWe now see our role as being proactive, warning citizens and working\nwith the media to make sure information is distributed accurately and\nquickly. AIRNow has convinced most of the air quality people to\n\ncome out from behind their computers and be ready to be in front of a\ncamera.\nOverview of Ozone and US Federal Regulations1\nOzone occurs naturally in the Earth's upper atmosphere - 10 to 30 miles above\nthe surface - where it forms a protective barrier that shields people from the\nsun's harmful ultraviolet rays. The barrier is sometimes called the \"ozone layer.\"\nBecause of pollution, ozone can also be found in the Earth's lower atmosphere, at\nground level. Ground-level ozone is a major ingredient of smog, and when\ninhaled - even at very low levels - it can damage people's lungs and cause a\nnumber of respiratory health effects. Ground-level ozone can also damage crops\nand many common man-made materials, such as rubber, plastic, and paint.\nGround-level ozone forms when various pollutants, such as volatile organic\ncompounds and nitrogen oxides, mix in the air and react chemically in the\npresence of heat and sunlight. These pollutants are known as ozone precursors.\nCommon sources of volatile organic compounds (often referred to as VOCs)\ninclude motor vehicles, gas stations, chemical plants and other industrial\nfacilities. Solvents such as dry-cleaning fluid and chemicals used to clean\nindustrial equipment are also sources of VOCs. Common sources of nitrogen\noxides include motor vehicles, power plants and even wood-burning stoves.\nBecause ground-level ozone forms more readily in the hot, sunny conditions of\nsummer, it tends to be a seasonal problem, approaching hazardous levels in the\nUS between May and September. It also travels easily. A summer ozone plume\ngenerated from Boston automobile and industrial exhaust could be in Maine's\nAcadia National Park in a matter of days.\nGround-level ozone is regulated under the Clean Air Act, the comprehensive\nfederal law amended in 1990, that regulates air emissions in the United States.\nAmong other things, the Clean Air Act requires the US EPA to set standards for\n\"criteria pollutants\" - six commonly occurring air pollutants, one of which is\nground-level ozone. These standards, known as the National Ambient Air\nQuality Standards (NAAQS), are national targets for acceptable concentrations of\neach of the criteria pollutants (see Exhibit 2). For each pollutant, the EPA has\ndeveloped two NAAQS standards:\n- The \"primary standard,\" which is intended to protect public health.\nInformation in this section was excerpted from Ozone Monitoring, Mapping and Public Outreach,\nEPA/625/R-99/007 September 1999.\n\n- The \"secondary standard,\" which is intended to prevent damage to the\nenvironment and property.\nExhibit 2: National Ambient Air Quality Standards\nPOLLUTANT\nSTANDARD\nVALUE *\nSTANDARD\nTYPE\nCarbon Monoxide (CO)\n9 ppm\n(10 mg/m3)\nPrimary\n(40 mg/m3)\nPrimary\nNitrogen Dioxide (NO2)\nAnnual Arithmetic Mean\n0.053 ppm\n(100 μg/m3)\nPrimary & Secondary\nOzone (O3)\n0.12 ppm\n(235 μg/m3)\nPrimary & Secondary\n0.08 ppm\n(157 μg/m3)\nPrimary & Secondary\nQuarterly Average\n1.5 μg/m3\nPrimary & Secondary\nParticulate (PM 10)\nParticles with diameters of 10 micrometers or less\nAnnual Arithmetic Mean\n50 μg/m3\nPrimary & Secondary\n150 μg/m3\nPrimary & Secondary\nParticulate (PM 2.5)\nParticles with diameters of 2.5 micrometers or less\nAnnual Arithmetic Mean\n15 μg/m3\nPrimary & Secondary\n65 μg/m3\nPrimary & Secondary\nSulfur Dioxide (SO2)\nAnnual Arithmetic Mean\n0.030 ppm\n3)\nPrimary\n0.14 ppm\n(365 μg/m3)\nPrimary\n0.50 ppm\n(1300 μg/m3)\nSecondary\n8-hour Average\n1-hour Average\n35 ppm\n1-hour Average\n8-hour Average\nLead (Pb)\n24-hour Average\n24-hour Average\n(80 μg/m\n24-hour Average\n3-hour Average\n* Parenthetical value is an approximately equivalent concentration.\nSource: www.epa.gov\nA geographic area that meets the primary health-based NAAQS is called an\nattainment area. Areas that do not meet the primary standard are called non-\nattainment areas.\nThe Clean Air Act requires each state to develop a \"state implementation plan\"\n(SIP), which describes the programs it will use to maintain good air quality in\nattainment areas and meet the NAAQS in non-attainment areas. For example, if\n\na city or region is a non-attainment area for ozone, the SIP describes the\nprograms that will be used to meet the primary NAAQS for ozone. For example,\nto address ozone non-attainment, a state could install vapor recovery nozzles at\ngasoline station pumps to reduce refueling emissions, adopt strict NOx emission\nlimits for power plants and industrial sources, limit solvent usage in factories, or\ntighten vehicle inspection programs.\nOne of the elements of a State's SIP is a network of monitors that measure\nconcentration of the six critical pollutants, including ozone. An ozone\nmonitoring network is an air quality surveillance system consisting of\nmonitoring stations that measure ambient concentrations of ozone hourly. The\nClean Air Act places the responsibility on states to establish and operate these\nozone monitoring networks and to report the data to the EPA. This schedule\ngives state monitoring organizations the opportunity to review their data for\naccuracy before reporting it. The EPA uses data from the air quality system\n(AQS) to determine whether an area is complying with the standards, and if not,\nwhat enforcement actions are required.\nAIRNow Takes Shape\nIn 1994, progressive EPA environmental engineers in Maryland began a pilot\nprogram to map their state ozone information. Hindered by poor computer\ncapabilities and access to only one state's information, their early maps were\nlimited and received little exposure. The pilot fizzled, but the idea survived.\nEncouraged by growing interest in the Internet, the EPA's Region 1, Boston office\npicked up the baton in 1996. Managers there reasoned they could pull data from\nmultiple states and make it available to the public on a website. Dave Conroy, a\nmanager in the Boston EPA air quality planning group, recalled, \"At the time,\nsome states had toll-free numbers and sent some information to newspapers, but\nwe felt we were not really getting the message about pollution levels out to the\npublic. We pooled our money with Maryland through an association called\nNESCAUM [New England States for Coordinated Air Use Management].\nNESCAUM let a contract to have the hourly ozone data from 13 New England\nand mid Atlantic states plus Washington, DC compiled into an animated map\nand posted on our website.\" Lee Alter, the project manager for NESCAUM who\nhad been involved from the project's early days, continued, \"We had collected\nthe data for 20 years, but no one ever looked at it. There was no easy way to\nshare; New York had to fax New Jersey to get its data. The regional EPA\nleadership backed the mapping project in order to build awareness about ozone,\nhelp people understand, for example, why vehicle inspections are important, and\nimprove public health.\" By May 1997, the software was up and running. Conroy\nsummarized, \"We achieved our objectives: we made the information available so\nthat interested people could seek it out.\"\n\nThat first summer, EPA Region 1 posted ozone maps and forecasts three times a\nday on the web from information that the states contributed voluntarily. By the\nend of the 1997 ozone season, however, it was struggling to overcome the\ncontentious organizational politics and technology hurdles it faced in its bid to\nextend its reach to additional states. Despite its initial success, one participant\nreckoned that the team did not have the resources to continue to support the\nprocess through the next year.\nEMPACT\nHelping hands reached out from an unexpected source. As yet unaware of the\nBoston project, Chet Wayland and Phil Dickerson in the EPA's central planning\norganization were looking for a way to accomplish the same goal, but at a\nnational level. They learned of a new Clinton administration initiative called\nEMPACT (Envrionmental Monitoring for Public Access and Community\nTracking). According to Dickerson, EMPACT began as a campaign promise. He\nnoted, \"When Clinton stopped in Kalamazoo in his re-election campaign, he\npromised people easier access to environmental data. Early in his second\nadministration, he created the EMPACT initiative.\" EMPACT funded project\nproposals to bring people up-to-date, understandable information about local\nenvironmental conditions (see Exhibit 3).\nExhibit 3: Key Events in U.S. Ozone Mapping\nU.S. State of Maryland began Ozone mapping\nU.S. EPA Region 1 took responsibility for ozone\nmapping and expanded it to 13 New England\nand mid Atlantic states and Washington D.C.\nPresident Clinton announced the EMPACT\nprogram\nEPA headquarters took over the ozone mapping\nprogram and named its initiative AIRNow\nEPA firewall improvements made it difficult for\nstates to upload their ozone data to EPA data\ncenter computers\nSonoma Technology was awarded the contract\nto run the AIRNow data collection and reporting\nsystems\n\nDickerson continued,\nChet and I wanted to bring data to the public in a format that they\ncould understand and without having to do a mainframe printout.\nEMPACT came along and provided resources via grants. We wrote\na grant request, and it was approved. Then we knew we had to\nproduce something. We had to figure out how we would pull it off.\nIn the fall of 1997, Wayland and Dickerson looked around the country and\ndiscovered that EPA Region 1 in Boston had technology that allowed them to\nproduce ozone maps. They went to meet with representatives of Region 1.\nWayland recalled, \"We thought, if we can get the money to build the\ninfrastructure we can carry this concept to a national level.\" They called their\nproject AIRNow. Dickerson continued,\nEverything clicked. It was just Chet and me. Chet was the\nmarketing management person, and I was the tech guy. I saw\ntechnology that I knew we could use, and Chet saw a process we\ncould bring down here and expand. Region 1 was starting to groan\nunder the weight of what they were doing and were running out of\nresources. We said we'll take the project, bring it to headquarters\nand try to expand it. Between that October and the following May,\nduring the ozone 'off-season,' we moved everything and tried to\nget it running with EPA headquarters in charge of it. And we tried\nto bring in some of the other regions. We expanded it down to\nSouth Carolina and into the Midwest.\nTo satisfy the EMPACT objectives, the EPA needed hourly ozone data from the\nstates. While states already had monitors in place to comply with AQS reporting\nrequirements, these systems were not designed for consistent, high quality,\nhourly data transmission. For example, some needed additional monitors or data\nloggers, others required faster modems. Dickerson continued,\nThe AIRNow data comes directly from the monitors at least once per\nhour. The data which is submitted to AQS quarterly has been subject to\nextensive quality assurance. Technically, the AIRNow and AQS data\nshouldn't be that different, but if a monitor is malfunctioning, AQS allows\nfor correction.\n\"In the early days of the program,\" noted Ron Stockett, air quality\nmonitor for the Missouri Department of Natural Resources, \"some were\nconcerned about sending in unchecked data.\" He continued,\n\nBut when it came to ozone, we had become very confident of our\ninstruments. We insisted that they allow us to use two instruments\nat each site, just for quality control. If both instruments have the\nsame data, then the numbers should be right. If one says 20 and the\nother says 80, you know something is wrong. That's our major\nmethod of quality control. We have people checking the data four\ntimes per day, and if the monitors at a location are not in\nagreement, we won't use the data from that location.\nStates' concerns were also eased by the fact that both ozone levels and\nforecasts would be shown on maps as color bars rather than precise\nnumbers. Wayland insisted from the beginning that states agree on a\nstandard ozone color key so that, for example, a \"red alert\" ozone day\nwould have the same meaning across the country (see Exhibit 4).\nWayland and Dickerson used their EMPACT grant to offer seed money to\nstates that wanted to join the initiative. This enabled states to purchase the\nnew hardware and software they needed to upgrade their data collection\ninfrastructure. In addition, Wayland got his own chain of command to\ncertify that AIRNow data would never be used to evaluate a state's\ncompliance with ozone regulations. According to Stockett, \"The EPA\n\nfunding was critical to the success of this project. States were willing to\nprovide horsepower, but didn't have the budget to provide hardware and\nsoftware.\"\nPicking up Steam\nAt the close of the 1998 ozone season, Wayland and Dickerson decided to move\nAIRNow's central data collection activity to the EPA's national data center in\nResearch Triangle Park, North Carolina. They asked the EPA's IT outsourcing\nprovider to supply post-processing, infrastructure, and an Internet web site.\nThey worked through the government's meticulous procedures for\nimplementing a new application and went live in April 1999. Dickerson recalls,\n\"This was groundbreaking for the people in the computer center. They had never\nsupported a public-access web application or had the requirement to collect and\nprocess data hourly. It was all brand new to them. And in the middle of the\ntransition, key technology people in Boston were moving on. We had to\nscramble.\"\nWith central processing under control, the AIRNow program directors were able\nto increase the frequency of ozone maps to seven times a day. They also brought\nadditional states on board. People like Mike Koerber, executive director of the\nLake Michigan Air Directors' Consortium, were invited to meetings Wayland\nconvened to discuss how to expand the program. Koerber remembered:\nEach state had its own computer systems and databases, and we never\nhad any luck trying to transfer mapping technology from one state to\nanother. But all of our states were thinking about ozone action programs\nand how to make the data available. With AIRNow, the EPA was offering\nto provide a consistent system and make it as easy as possible to tie in. It\nwas obvious to everyone that this was a good thing.\nForsyth County, North Carolina's Weinstock continued, \"Being a small agency,\nwe like innovation. When Chet called and asked us to participate in the\nforecasting program, he didn't have to twist my arm. North Carolina is one of\nthe top ten states for air quality problems, so everyone realized this was a smart\nthing to do.\"\nIn an effort to expand the program, Wayland launched an annual AIRNow\nconference for all the initiative's participants and prospects. One environmental\nengineer recalled, \"Chet would start by saying it was our program. He would\nhave speakers talk about what they had accomplished, and then he would get up\nand ask us what we needed to take our programs to the next step.\"\n\nUnder Wayland's supportive leadership, more states and cities volunteered to\nparticipate. Sacramento, Los Angeles, San Diego, San Francisco and the central\nCalifornia valley had been working with Sonoma Technology, a local contractor,\nfor several years to map their own region. Wayland signed Sonoma up as the\nwest coast mapping center. Subsequently, Washington State, Arizona and Texas\njoined the initiative. By early 2000, 35 states and 100 cities were transmitting\nhourly ozone levels to the EPA.\nAs the AIRNow program expanded, it hit some technology bumps. For example,\nan early 2000 GAO audit of the EPA's security found serious issues. It threatened\nto shut down the EPA's connection to the Internet unless the agency\nimplemented a strict firewall. On February 17, 2000, the firewall went up, and\nAIRNow went down. Dickerson recalls, \"We came back from a conference and\nfound that we were no longer connected to the Internet. There was no warning\nor lead time. It was a complete blow.\"\nOver the next eight weeks, the AIRNow team reconfigured the data collection\nprocess so that states could drop off their ozone information to mirrored servers\noutside the firewall. The files would be picked up, encrypted and brought inside\nthe firewall. The team was less than thrilled with the 15-minute processing delay\nthis introduced into their hourly cycle, but they were back in operation before the\n2000 ozone season opened.\nAIRNow Airs\nAs luck would have it, USA Today was redesigning its weather page in the spring\nof 2000. Lynne Perri, deputy managing editor, went looking for something that\nwould make her paper distinctive. She explained, \"We needed something that\nour readers couldn't get from either TV or from a big city newspaper. We started\ntalking to people, and the folks at the American Lung Association led us to Chet.\nThere were some issues to iron out, but in the end, we decided to see if we could\npull off daily air quality forecasting.\" AIRNow's data did not match Perri's needs\nexactly. She wanted daily information for 36 key cities in the US. AIRNow\ncarried information on more than 100 cities, but some on Perri's list like\nNashville and New Orleans were missing. For those cities, Perri's paper ran\n\"N/A\" while the AIRNow team tried to pull their environmental monitoring\norganizations into the community. Wayland also opened up conversations with\nCNN and The Weather Channel.\nTo address lingering technology glitches, Wayland hired a new program\nmanager, John White. When White arrived, he found FORTRAN programs, flat\ntext files and no data archives. Because of the increased media exposure and\nneed for overall data management, the team decided to upgrade AIRNow to an\nOracle database system to increase reliability and to improve the team's ability to\n\nproduce new products with the data. Despite EPA's bias toward keeping systems\nwork in-house, the team decided to work with an outside contractor. White\nenumerated the reasons:\nFirst, the contractors who run the in-house systems understand\ncomputers, but not weather or air quality. We wanted more scientific\npeople who could help us actually understand the data and propose new\nways to present the information. Second, an outside contractor turned out\nto be cheaper. Third, we could speed up our data turnaround process if\nwe got outside the EPA firewall.\nSonoma Technology won the contract to develop the new MapCon software in\nearly 2001 and when it delivered at the end of the year, earned a three-year\ncontract to run the system. Tim Dye, vice president of meteorological programs\nand public outreach for Sonoma, summarized:\nWe bring two critical things to AIRNow. We are meteorologists, not\ncomputer technicians. So we know right away when the data do not look\nright. Secondly, we recognize the importance of reliability when we're\nfeeding data to media outlets like The Weather Channel. We have an\nOracle database running on redundant servers and hard drives. We have\nautomated as much of the processing as possible to provide speedier,\nreliable service.\nDye asserted that strong communication and good coordination was at the crux\nof the program. He continued:\nAIRNow doesn't exist without the stakeholders. They are key to its\nsurvival. The program needs to figure out how best to serve the\nstakeholders so they are overwhelmingly compelled to participate. How\ndo we do it? We monitor things closely, and we have a few folks who are\nreally good at communicating. For example, last week one of our\nmeteorologists saw a strange reading from one of the monitors and sent\nout an email. The stakeholder with the problem wasn't talking to a\ntechnician; he was talking to a colleague. We speak their language.\nOnce processing moved to Sonoma, new products and features were added\nregularly. For example, the program went to hourly updates of maps from a\nschedule of seven times a day (Exhibit 5 shows a technical schematic). The media\nwere receiving their data feeds like clock work. By this time, a total of 45 states\nand more than 100 agencies were contributing their data. This included Georgia,\na late-comer among southeastern states, which had gotten tired of explaining\nwhy it was grayed out on all the air quality maps. Sonoma's Dye noted,\n\n\"AIRNow has so much momentum that people now participate because their\ndata and information really go places and are being used by the public. AIRNow\nis providing ozone maps and air quality forecasts that go to The Weather\nChannel, USA Today, and local TV. This year they're updated at 30 minutes past\nthe hour rather than at 45 minutes past the hour as was done last year. So we're\ncloser to real-time.\"\nBy 2003, EPA had developed a feature entitled \"Where I Live\" on www.epa.gov\nto provide tailored information to individuals. They also implemented AIRNow\nTech, a private website for the stakeholders. This portal, gave environmental\nagencies complete access to the ozone database and the ability to conduct their\nown analyses.\nMaking a Difference\nIt was hard to pinpoint health or environmental benefits that could be attributed\ndirectly and exclusively to AIRNow, although all would agree that it had made\nan impact. According to Boston's Conroy, \"We started a service in the region\ncalled Smog Alert Service, where people sign up on a list to receive notice by\nemail or fax when states are forecasting unhealthy air. There are about 2000\n\norganizations on our list -- nurses, day camps, nursery schools. While we cannot\nquantify how this data helps the public, sometimes we get replies like 'Thanks\nfor the service. It helps with an asthmatic child.'\" Another air quality forecaster\nnoted that a football coach in California routinely cancelled practices when bad\nozone days were forecast. Wayland added:\nWe get tons of email from the public. Someone who runs a daycare center\ncan send the kids outside in the morning if air quality is forecast to be bad\nin the afternoon. Some proactive cities like Washington DC make the\nbusses free on ozone action days. We have cases in Baltimore where\ncompanies voluntarily shut down certain manufacturing processes on a\nbad day. UCLA did a study that showed hospital admissions for children\nwith respiratory problems declined four to seven percent on days when\nair quality forecasts were for unhealthy levels. People with asthma and\nheart problems know to stay indoors and rest so they won't end up in the\nemergency room.\nSusannah Fuchs, senior program and air quality director of the American Lung\nAssociation of Eastern Missouri, noted that companies often take steps to reduce\npollution during ozone season, especially if a bad air day is forecast. She pointed\nout, \"A company's transportation coordinator might coordinate carpools or even\nprovide bus passes.\" Some firms voluntarily changed their work hours to avoid\nadding to rush hour ozone levels. Others delayed using gasoline powered lawn\nmowers until air quality improved. Supporters hoped that these voluntary\nmeasures would add up to enough air quality improvement that the state would\nultimately avoid EPA sanctions. One state official remarked, \"We'd rather not\nhave the EPA enforcers watching over our shoulders.\"\nForsyth County's Weinstock added, \"I can't document that I have saved\nanyone's life, but people appreciate the product and tell us so. And the alerts in\nNorth Carolina have gotten state legislators to pay more attention to power\nplants and cars. Legislators who never would have voted for increased air\nquality regulation will do it now because of the code orange and red alerts.\" He\ncontinued, \"Chet's group deserves the credit for demonstrating why this is\nimportant. They don't like to take credit for themselves, but they shield people\nfrom red tape and encourage collaboration. People love to work with them, and\nthat's not typical of the local-state-EPA relationship. Chet has often asked us to\npresent at his conferences, and he helped us win an EPA national award. We\ndon't have to do this, but it's fun and innovative and our boss loves it.\"\nDye went further, \"This program has something for everyone. Getting\nmeaningful air quality information out there helps people to take action to\nimprove their own health. In addition, this program enhances the capabilities of\n\nthe air quality agencies that participate. They're providing a clear public service,\nand when they see their work on TV, it makes that agency stand out. For myself,\nI'm a scientist. I used to be content to sit at my computer and do my research.\nWith AIRNow, for the first time, I'm doing something that really makes a\ndifference for people. It changed my life.\"\nFacing the Future\nAccording to LADCO's Koerber, AIRNow's success created high expectations for\nair quality efforts in general. He remarked, \"Public awareness is high. Policy\nmakers, the media and the public want to know, if we can do ozone, why we\ncan't we do particles and other pollutants? These are very challenging.\"\nWayland and the AIRNow team pushed ahead. By October 1, 2003 they began to\nreport and forecast air quality year round. However, monitoring and forecasting\nparticulate matter (PM2.5), the winter pollutant, involved a great deal more effort.\nIt required a different monitor - a filter-based system which collected a sample\nthat was sent to a laboratory for analysis. While 1300 ozone monitors were\noperating in the US, only 280 PM2.5 monitors were in place. In addition, many\nagencies were not staffed for year-round forecasting. Their professionals used\nthe ozone off-season to take care of other responsibilities. Finally, EMPACT\nfunding had run out in 2001, so the team had to rely on states and cities to fund\ntheir own operations.\nUSA Today's Perri encouraged, \"Our readers love the ozone air quality data that\nwe publish. Baby boomers grew up with enhanced weather coverage and want\nmore and more sophisticated information. We will be covering the Olympics in\nGreece in 2004 and are already talking about how air quality in Greece can affect\nathletes and tourists.\"\nDickerson was undaunted by the challenges ahead. He explained, \"People tell\nyou to plan things in advance. But with AIRNow, if we had planned up front,\nI'm not sure we would have done as well. We would have come up with a\ndifferent answer. As it was, we just had a spark that turned into a bigger and\nbigger fire.\" Wayland continued, \"Five years ago, colleagues within the EPA felt\nthat the AIRNow program would never work and believed it would be difficult\nto find the requisite state resources to fund the program. Today, given the\npublic's demand for information about air quality, it would be difficult, maybe\nimpossible, to stop the program.\""

      "content": "This case was prepared by Cyrus F. Gibson at the Sloan School of Management, Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The\nauthor would like to thank the many Lifeline Systems employees who contributed to making the case possible.\n\nCopyright (c)1998 Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n10/18/99\nLifeline Systems, Inc. -- The CareSystem Project\n\nIn November 1998, Ron Feinstein and Rich Reich, CEO and VP of Technology and Advanced\nServices of Lifeline Systems, Inc., were reviewing the status of the CareSystem project. The\nproject, currently estimated at $12 million (greater than 15% of Lifeline's annual revenues) would\nbe a totally new information technology platform for running the telephone response center.\nIndeed, CareSystem was known among senior managers to be a \"bet the company\" project. Ron\nand Rich knew that a smooth migration to the new platform, scheduled to begin December 1, was\nessential. Delay could be costly and a lost phone call from a subscriber could mean a loss of life.\n\nThe CareSystem project was running eight months late and some 100% over budget compared to\noriginal estimates in 1996. Nevertheless, Ron, Rich and the rest of Lifeline's 7-person senior\nmanagement team, which had been closely involved in all phases of the project, felt in retrospect\nthat project problems had been well handled.\n\nIn mid-October Lifeline had announced an agreement to be acquired by Protection One, a security\nmonitoring firm, subject to approval by shareholders of both companies. While Ron and Rich\nanticipated that Lifeline would continue quite autonomously after the acquisition, they were\nanxious that the new owners begin to see the benefits in cost reduction and expanded revenues as\nsoon as possible. As in other respects, the new technology of the CareSystem project was key to\nsuch future benefits.\n\nAs they reviewed the status of the CareSystem project, Ron and Rich wanted to be sure they had\nnot missed any areas of risk as the \"go live\" date approached.\n\nThe Business\n\nLifeline Systems was the market share leader in the \"personal response industry,\" providing\ntelephone answering service in response to elderly individuals who called from their homes. A\ncall was typically initiated by the caller pressing a button on a pendant or wristband. This in turn\nactivated the communicator box like a remote cordless phone. The call was answered and handled\nby a trained monitor from the call center in Lifeline's Cambridge or Toronto location. Each\nmonitor, with a hands-free headset, sat at a computer terminal on which the essential information\non the subscriber appeared as the call was answered. (For more information on the service, see\nwww.lifelinesys.com.)\n\nLifeline manufactured the pendants and communicator sets and sold or leased them to health care\nproviders throughout the US and Canada. A physician might recommend to a patient, particularly\none living alone and with a condition not serious enough for full-time institutional care, the use of\nthe Lifeline service. The local hospital would then install the equipment in the subscriber's home\nand show how to operate it. The hospital could provide the answering service themselves, or\ncontract to pay Lifeline a monthly fee to answer calls on the provider's behalf from Lifeline's\nresponse centers.\n\nFrom Product to Service\n\nLifeline was founded in 1974 by the inventor of the personal help button and communicator box\ndevices. Initially the focus was on manufacturing and selling the product, through channels\ndirectly to the consumer. In 1978 A. Dennis Shapiro joined as Chairman and CEO. Significant\nnew financing from private sources was achieved for product development. Marketing was\nrefocused on hospitals and doctors. The response center service was established as a source of\nsustained revenue.\n\nIn the 1980's a new CEO was named, with Shapiro remaining as Chairman. Perceiving that the\ntraditional channel through hospitals was maturing, the company sought to stimulate that market\nand also to broaden to other markets for its personal communicator products. Price reductions to\nhospitals led to a spurt of increased sales, with record revenue of $32 million in 1991, growth in\nprofit of 600%, and a near quadrupling of stock price. The emergency response equipment was\nredesigned and offered through new channels, such as telephone stores, for other consumer uses.\nIn addition to these moves the company worked to increase the proportion of its subscribers who\nused its central response center.\n\nHowever, difficulties with the expansion strategy quickly emerged. The devices through retail\nwere priced at $300, while hospitals paid over $500 per unit for essentially the same technology,\nboth plus a monthly fee for the monitoring service. Many hospitals, the traditional channel and\npartner in service, were alienated. Independently, Lifeline's revenues fell and a first quarter loss\nwas reported in 1992.\n\nRon Feinstein, brought to the Lifeline Board by Chairman Dennis Shapiro in the early 1980's,\nbecame CEO in 1992. The company shifted away from the product diversification policy and\nrefocused on the needs of the subscriber and the provider channel. Revenues and profits\nrecovered, with steady growth continuing through the third quarter of 1998. (See selected\nfinancial statements, Exhibits 1 and 2.)\n\nCurrent Operations\n\nIn 1998 the company growth and success continued to depend on products and services\nessentially unchanged for ten years. The proportion of revenue from service revenue (call\nmonitoring and outsourcing of provider business such as accounting and billing to subscribers)\nhad grown from 33% in 1993 to 60%. Over 2000 hospitals and other healthcare providers offered\nLifeline services. Cost for installation was $50 to $100, and monthly fees for subscribers averaged\n$32 per month. Total subscribers to Lifeline stood at over 350,000, some 230,000 of whom were\nserved centrally by the company. Annual revenues from these monitoring services were running\nat approximately $40 million, and increasing at an annual rate of 25%, compared to product\nrevenues, at $24 million and declining at 6% a year. It was estimated that in order to grow the\nnumber of centrally-monitored subscribers by 20% per year it would be necessary to add some\n12,000 subscribers to the central database per month. This would be to replace those lost (22% to\nnursing homes, 17% deceased, and other less significant causes), and could come from new\nsubscribers or from conversions from the provider monitored segment.\n\nMonitors in the response center answered up to 18,000 calls in a 24-hour period, each call lasting\nfrom a few seconds to several minutes. The 230 monitors operated in three shifts continuously.\nEach shift was further subdivided into \"self directed teams\" of five to eight individuals, who sat\nnear each other and offered assistance to and took calls for team colleagues as needed. Each shift\nalso had at least two \"coaches\" and one \"manager\" in charge of the shift, all of whom were\nthemselves experienced monitors. Coach and manager positions were only filled from within.\nPay for monitors and coaches ranged from $9.75 to $14.00 per hour. Managers and the head of\nthe response center were salaried, with an average gross pay of $45,000 plus benefits. Benefits\nfor all employees ran about 15% of base pay.\n\nManagers conducted performance appraisal of monitors once every six months. Monitors were\neligible for a merit pay increase once a year. A key basis for performance appraisal was the use of\nrecordings of a monitor's calls, with explicit comparison made to his/her team peers. Evaluation\nwas based on how quickly and how effectively monitors handled calls. Coaches also conducted\nfeedback discussions with monitors using the recordings, but not as direct input to pay increase\ndecisions. One manager described an important factor influencing monitor performance,\nincluding quality of responsiveness and efficiency of handling calls, as the peer pressure from\nteam members. Turnover of monitors was not significant, and in 1998 new hiring was going on at\nthe rate of four per month.\n\nStrategic Opportunities and Direction\n\nRon Feinstein and his senior management colleagues believed Lifeline was well positioned to\ngrow and thrive in the evolving market for elderly and homebound servicing. They pointed to the\nprojections of the growing population of the elderly, due both to the aging of the baby-boom\ngeneration and the increase in life expectancy. In addition, the achievement of a balanced Federal\nbudget in 1997 had meant cutbacks in home health care funding, which in turn drove medical\nproviders (Lifeline's \"customers,\" who were key to recommending the emergency call service to\ntheir patients) to look for less expensive ways of caring for patients.\n\nLifeline held some 70% of the market for emergency response. Several senior managers believed\ntheir competitive position was strong, given their relationships with the providers as a sales\nchannel and the effectiveness of their response center operations. One commented, \"The only\nsizable potential competitor would be one of the big home and office security firms, but their\nstyle and culture are different. They protect things; we protect people. Getting into our kind of\nservices would be a big change for them.\"\n\nIn reviewing its history, Ron saw Lifeline entering a third phase of its business cycles, changing\nits nature but still within its founding vision:\n\nI want this to be a company that sustains itself and gets stronger over time. We went from\ndependence on a maturing product to services, and now we are poised to be a business\nbased on information exchange and information as a resource. Through these changes in\nthe business we remain focused on our mission, to enable the elderly to live independently\nin their homes. We are positioned to take advantage of changes in demographics and\n\nhealth care economics. The market for services to the elderly is just beginning to open up.\nWe have and should be able to sustain our competitive lead. This business is a wonderful\nopportunity to help people, do some good, and get paid doing it!\n\nRon described the three strategic phases in Lifeline's history graphically as three life-cycle curves\n(see Exhibit 3.)\n\nStaff and Management\n\nLifeline prided itself on providing an important personal service to its subscribers. Training and\nprotocols for call center monitors reflected the importance of patience, courtesy and\nunderstanding in dialogue with callers. At the same time, diligence and accuracy in following up\na call were vital, including providing information to responders (those in a subscriber's data file\nwho were to be notified, such as relatives), notifying emergency services (such as the local\nambulance service), and providing fax reports to the provider or physician upon closure of the\ncase.\n\nA recruiting video illustrated that monitors were themselves gratified and pleased with the service\nthey provided. Many monitors first heard about Lifeline through friends who worked there.\nSeveral managers noted that they had elderly parents or relatives who were themselves\nsubscribers to Lifeline. Less than 5% of calls were true emergencies, but monitors were\nencouraged to treat any call as an opportunity to provide support and reassurance to a subscriber.\nIn times of need in the call center, employees from other parts of the company would leave their\nregular work and come to the center to help out.\n\nTom Loper, Vice President of Customer Care, described his role since joining Lifeline in 1995 as\nbuilding the culture. With a PhD in organizational psychology and years of experience in human\nresources, sales and marketing, and as president of a firm, Loper had known and worked with Ron\nFeinstein over a period of years before being asked by Ron to come to Lifeline. Loper had\noverseen the development of systems and procedures for employee selection and training, for\ncoaching and evaluation and rewards, and for communications and involvement. He and his\ncolleagues believed they had succeeded in fostering a caring and committed workforce which was\nalso diligent and highly effective in customer and subscriber relations.\n\nRon Feinstein conducted monthly informal sessions with employees, typically attended by twenty\nor more, in which virtually all aspects of the business were discussed.\n\nThe senior management group was composed of seven individuals, all but two of whom had been\nrecruited by Feinstein when he became CEO in 1992. Feinstein had known and worked with most\nof these in a series of management positions at Dennison Manufacturing Company and elsewhere.\nThe senior managers met monthly to discuss business, and also constituted most of the IT\nSteering Committee and key roles in the CareSystem team. Only one senior manager had left\nLifeline during Feinstein's tenure as CEO.\n\nThe CareSystem Project\n\nIn 1996 the company began investigations that led to the CareSystem project to replace both the\ninfrastructure and the applications for the telephony-computer based central monitoring services.\nAt that time the existing, home-grown system, known as CORMIS, was ten years old, had been\ndesigned for 7000 calls per day (in 1998 calls were running up to 16,000 per day, and on-line\nphone time was growing at 30% per year), and was on a DEC-VAX based platform. CORMIS\nwas built around a Cullinet (subsequently Computer Associates) database product. The database\nproduct, being of mid-1980's technology, had become obsolete with no easy upgrade path,\nrestricting options for significant upgrade or enhancement. Computer Associates no longer\nprovided effective support, and it had become virtually impossible to find support staff with any\nexpertise (or interest) in the technology. The database and system architecture would limit future\nscalability and could not demonstrate the levels of fault tolerance that the rapidly expanding\nbusiness required.\n\nRich Reich commented:\n\nOur management team investigations led us to consider the significant advancement made in database\ntechnology since the original product that CORMIS used was developed, and to consider the rapid evolution\nof client server technologies. We fairly quickly determined that it should be a priority to develop an\nentirely new generation of call center service delivery platform that had the ability to support future growth\nand be flexible in meeting evolving business needs.\n\nIn addition, there was an incompatible parallel call system. In 1996 Lifeline had acquired\nCommuniCall, a firm which offered a social service of talking to subscribers, typically the\nelderly, for unlimited periods of time. It was infeasible to integrate the CommuniCall system with\nCORMIS. This resulted in two separate call center operations, with two separate desktop screens\nand two separate groups of monitors on each shift, and two separate billing and reporting systems.\nIt was thus impossible to efficiently balance the assignment calls to available monitors.\n\nBusiness Goals for CareSystem\n\nLifeline's senior management team set four business goals for the CareSystem project:\n\n1. Reduce the risk of a lost call or break in communications with a subscriber during an\nemergency.\n\nThe system was designed to support this through increased capacity and fault-tolerant\nhardware and software. Moreover, the applications software at the desktop was to be \"closed\nloop\" in that it would be impossible for a monitor to let a call go unfulfilled without a warning\nnotification. The system would be Y2K compliant, which could not be assured with the\nCORMIS platform\n\n2. Improve efficiency and cost competitiveness.\n\nWhen properly used by monitors, the system would enable more efficient and effective\nhandling of calls, such as due to the capability of the monitor making more than one call\n\nwithout hanging up on the subscriber. \"System-enforced protocols\" would result in service\nthat was more consistent, more efficient, and of higher quality. The new system enabled\n\"skills-based routing\" by which a call from a subscriber with special needs (e.g., Spanish\nlanguage, or diabetes patient who might require medical advice) was directed by the system to\na monitor on duty with those skills, saving much time once the call was answered. The system\nwould allocate calls to monitors, rather than depend on the current method of a monitor taking\ncalls from the top of the list as he or she chose, thereby improving work distribution or\n\"balancing.\" Statistics would be collected individual monitor's use, including not only total\ntime on a call but also how effectively the features of the system were utilized. These statistics\ncould be used in individual performance appraisal, or even for monitoring the monitors on a\nregular or real-time basis, enabling improved feedback to the monitors.\n\nThe new system was a necessary first step toward the move to new headquarters in\nFramingham, where the rental cost savings over Cambridge was expected to pay for half the\namortized cost of the entire CareSystem project over ten years. And finally, the flexible and\nscalable new system would enable extending to multi-site centers in lower labor cost locations\nin the state or the country with no loss of reliability.\n\n3. Support and enhance revenue and subscriber growth for the future.\n\nThe scalability feature of the system would enable expanded memory and database capacity\nas well as growth of needed monitoring desktops. The open-systems architecture would allow\nnew and as yet unknown software to be plugged in to provide for platform enhancement.\nNew services to the existing customer base were quickly envisioned, including such things as\nproactive calling to subscribers to remind them of medication or just to provide support.\n\n4. Develop a foundation for the future around a central relational database.\n\nWhile CORMIS had a central database of essential information for subscribers, it was\nstructured to support a single service, and had limitations on how it could be modified and\nexpanded. Before the new CareSystem database was defined, a significant effort was made\nby senior management to envision how the business could evolve and change in the future.\nWhile the specifics of future business offerings could not be articulated at this time, the new\ndata model would be designed to accommodate the evolution of the business toward the\nvision. CareSystem would allow for a central database that could include and relate better\ninformation on subscribers, providers, referral sources, multiple services, and equipment.1\n\nIt was expected that integrated data and information could be invaluable not only the current\ncustomers and subscribers, but ultimately for new markets. While managers were reluctant to\ndescribe what some of these were, one said, \"Just imagine how valuable it would be if we\n\n1 The importance of central, shared data had not always been recognized at Lifeline. In 1995, several IT applications\nprojects were contemplate or underway which would have served separate functional needs with separate systems.\nThese included systems for manufacturing, for customer (health care provider) business operations and outsourcing,\nand for sales support, and even a separated system to replace CORMIS. As one manager put it, \"We were at risk of\nlosing what we now see as the crown jewels of our business.\" After considerable discussion and debate, it was\ndecided to work toward a common database for subscribers and customers.\n\ncould monitor our subscribers' vital signs in some way, and forewarn their doctors of an\nimpending crisis. Or think of the value to the subscriber and interest to a local service to be\nable to help them with grocery orders or meals-on-wheels. The opportunities are huge.\"\n\nProject Initiation\n\nIn 1996, having decided an entirely new system would be necessary, the management team next\nconsidered building their own new software vs. buying and integrating packages. This choice was\nmade problematical by the fact that although there were many \"computer-telephony integration\"\n(CTI) packages on the market, most of them were for conventional uses like inbound customer-\ninitiated inquiries or outbound telemarketing. In these uses initiation of the communication was\npredominately one-way and typically did not require a sequence of related phone calls. Lifeline's\nrequirements included, for example, that a subscriber calling with emergency needs be kept on the\nline while one or more other calls were made on his or her behalf.\n\nEarly inquiries into package makers nevertheless led Lifeline managers to believe that\nmodifications of currently available CTI and other software packages and their integration into a\nnew system essentially customized to Lifeline's requirements was the best approach. They also\ndecided to choose a systems integrator consultant. In October 1996, after a four-month proposal\nreview and screening process, Cambridge Technology Partners (CTP) was chosen as the lead\nconsultant. The choice included not only criteria of technical competence and experience with\nsimilar projects, but a judgement that there could be compatible working relationships and the\nopportunity for Lifeline technical staff to be integral to the project team.\n\nFrom the earliest days of the project, Ron Feinstein and Rich Reich kept the Board of Directors\ninformed and sought their advice. All recognized that if the upgrade effort failed, \"we are out of\nbusiness.\" One key member of the Board, with years of experience in the information technology\nindustry, became an important supporter of the project and helped explain to and influence the\nviews of other board members.\n\nAn overall schematic of the CareSystem architecture, from a company brochure, is shown in\nExhibit 4.\n\nPhase I - Scoping and Package Evaluation\n\nThe project began with an eight-week phase to establish requirements and scope of release one of\nthe new system. Fifteen Lifeline staff and six CTP staff were full-time, plus technical experts and\ntechnology architects from CTP as needed. The lifeline core team included Rich Reich and Tom\nLoper, VP of Customer Care, plus managers representing all the business areas of the company.\nWin Shute, Director of IT who reported to Rich Reich, was also full time, as was the Lifeline\nproject manager, Christine McFarland. A key ingredient of this phase, according to McFarland,\nwas to ensure that software would be \"component-based,\" namely would be installable and\nremovable on a more or less plug-compatible basis. Moreover, the role of Reich and Loper was\n\"to keep us thinking strategically and long-term\" in setting requirements and evaluating software\nvendors.\n\nAn early activity of this phase was the senior managers' articulation of their view of current\nbusiness needs, their vision of the future business needs, and their approach to an evolutionary\npath to the future. They worked a this intensively until they felt they were in alignment. This\narticulated vision became the basis for the interdisciplinary project team to define the scope and\ncapabilities of the new system.\n\nAt about the same time, a user team of seven individuals was created. Five of these were\nmonitors and coaches from the call center, one was from customer assistance (the group that dealt\nwith the providers), and one from business management services, which dealt with such\nbusinesses as outsourcing to providers. The team of seven developed an extensive list of specific\nrequirements for the proposed object-oriented, mouse-driven desktop. Their input was key to the\ndesign phase. The user team also became the trainers for CareSystem later in the project.\n\nPhase II - Proof of Concept\n\nAt Lifeline's initiation, this phase was introduced into CTP's normal methodology. Partly as a\nresult of the broad criteria and strategic discussions in the first phase, it was decided to build a\nprototype of the desktop screens for the call center monitors. This phase lasted six weeks. In\nretrospect, Lifeline managers saw it as an extremely important step in that concrete visible\n\"screen pops\" were generated and discussion of design, the next phase, was more concrete.\n\nPhase III - Design\n\nA result of the interest and insight of the previous phase was that more areas of complexity for\ndesktop functionality were uncovered and carried into the design phase. In addition, because the\nplatform was essentially being built for future enhancements and applications not yet known or\nimagined, there was a constant tension between growing the system and keeping it limited. Even\nthe concept of scalable, plug-compatible modules for infrastructure and applications did not\nentirely ease this tension and the potential for deliberations to go on endlessly. Moreover, the\nteam discovered during this phase that integration of vendor software packages was more\ncomplex than either Lifeline or CTP had anticipated. Good new ideas for functionality or\nmodularity at the application level raised intricate specific problems of software integration. Each\nof these had to be documented.\n\nThe design phase began in early February, 1997, and ran six weeks later than scheduled, ending\nin mid-June. While Rich Reich and Ron Feinstein and other senior managers were wary of the\nconsulting \"burn rate\" for every day beyond original plan, a rate of approximately $20,000 per\nweek, they and the team felt the discussions and reasons for delay were important.\n\nLooking back on the early phases in October, 1998, project manager Christine McFarland said:\n\nIn my 12 years of project work in several companies and as a consultant I have never seen such dedication\nand involvement of the right people on a project. Managers with tenure and long experience in the running\nof the business were dedicated, full time, to the project scoping and design. Ron Feinstein met with us\nregularly and showed he knew what was going on. We all knew the importance, the risk, and the value of\nthe project to the company's future. No one was afraid to raise constraints or suggest new ideas. It was\ntextbook and successful in that respect.\n\nIn retrospect we may have bent over backward a little too much in being open to all inputs. Every new idea,\ngood or bad, had to meet the test of what it would take to build into the system which we all knew had to be\ntotally reliable and redundant.\n\nWe might have saved some time by being more forceful about what was really feasible for the project. But\nit's hard to see how the outcome at this point could have been better, particularly the commitment everyone\naround here feels now to a successful full implementation.\n\nThe design phase produced a two-volume set of system specifications.\n\nPhase IV - Development\n\nA full production environment was established at Lifeline for development, a \"model office\" next\nto the call center. Three releases were planned:\n\n1. Minimum functional screens. --Completed in September 1997, including user testing\nand review.\n\n2. Added functionality to screens, conversion of data from CORMIS for further\ndevelopment and testing. --Completed in late October 1997.\n\n3. Final acceptance testing. --Scheduled for January 1998.\n\nIt was not until this third subphase that relatively serious problems arose. Bugs were discovered\nin the package software of one of the vendors. The issues escalated when the vendor was unable\nto respond or resolve the issues quickly. Ron Feinstein and a senior CTP officer visited the CEO\nof the firm in California. This resulted in a more efficient relationship, with the firms' software\nengineers coming on site to Cambridge to make the fixes. As this was nearing resolution,\ntechnical problems were found with a second vendor's package. This time escalation to the top\nand the vendor's responsiveness happened more quickly.\n\nRich Reich commented on the experience:\n\nI don't know how we could have known at the outset what we know now.\n\nThere is a rapid velocity of development and change in leading software products. Young companies are\nexperiencing meteoric growth and are frequently unable to keep up with the development of an internal\ninfrastructure that assures quality and proper customer service. Vendor assurances of their package's\nreliability, and the fact that they are installed and running in call centers of their clients, were reassuring to\nus. Experience has now shown us that leading complex and flexible third party software can become very\nproblematic when configured to meet the needs of a demanding non-mainstream business application. The\napplications exhibited significant bugs, and did not always perform as documented. It became apparent that\ntheir tremendous flexibility became their greatest weakness - not all configurations had been adequately\ntested by the vendor.\n\nAn additional difficulty in evaluating and applying new product categories is the lack of experienced\ndevelopment resources who would have some depth of understanding of the idiosyncrasies and limitations\nof new major products.\n\nThe issue for us, and for firms like us, is how to deal with these incredibly fast growing, dynamic vendors\nwhen we are as small as they are.\n\nThe net result of the delays was that final testing and the final release was not complete until mid-\nNovember. Nevertheless, the testing resulting in no serious problems, and it was felt that the\ncutover to live use, scheduled to begin with 5,000 subscribers on December first, was quite\nfeasible.\n\nFormal training of the monitors began in mid November, and was conducted by the seven\nmembers of the \"user team\" that had been involved in requirements setting from early in the\nproject. The user team had also developed a new manual, called the \"protocol book\" which\ndescribed in detail how the new system was to be used for all features. To enable training to take\nplace, individual monitors at a time were taken from their normal job desk to the model office.\nTo replace them, Lifeline had hired twenty additional monitors in October, spread over the three\nshifts. Training would extend well into 1999. It was estimated that the cost of training and\nimplementation on the user side was some $750,000.\n\nThe full implementation of CareSystem was now estimated to be the end of June, 1999. This\nwould make the project a full year later than originally intended.\n\nTom Loper had this to say about the delay and about the project in general:\n\nWe all recognize the complexity and difficulty of the project. No one is really surprised at the delay; it isn't\nunusual and it certainly isn't the result of resistance to change or implementation. The monitors are\nmotivated by a diligent handling of a subscriber, as well as by their concern for that subscriber's well being.\nWe have designed the system and our use of it so that it provides the monitors with data which they can use\nfor feedback on their performance. The user team represented a bottom-up factor in design.\n\nWhile I think we have a deep store of support, we really must adhere to the schedule from here on to keep\nthe confidence of the company. Monitors are upbeat about using the new system. The salesforce is eager to\nbegin offering new services.\n\nI've been involved in four major systems implementations in my career. This is one that has really been\ndone right!\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nAs Ron Feinstein and Rich Reich reflected on the history and importance of the CareSystem\nproject they were comfortable with what they knew of potential issues and problems around the\nimplementation itself. It appeared the plan for the transition allowed for backing out if\nunexpected problems occurred. They felt they had sought out and learned about all their vendors\ncould tell them about the technical and user-change issues in such implementations, and that the\ninvolvement and change management within Lifeline was adopted to their unique culture.\nNevertheless, they were anxious not to assume they knew it all, and wanted to make sure the rest\nof the management team had the same attitude.\n\nWhile neither of the two had any intention of diverting attention from the transition over the next\nfew months, both men were eager to see the benefits of the new services which could be offered,\nand to using the new infrastructure as a strategic resource for the future \"information exchange\"\ncompany. They felt the coming phase of the company's business evolution, now to be within the\nstructure of a parent company, would enable it to further fulfill providing a vita personal and\nhealth care services while making money.\n\nExhibit 1: Lifeline Systems, Inc.--Consolidated Statements of Income (Dollars in thousands)\nDec-88\nDec-90\nDec-92\nDec-95\nDec-96\nDec-97 9 mos 98\nRevenues\nServices\n--\n$4,145\n$7,723\n$18,602\n$24,220\n$32,031\n$28,490\nNet product Sales\n$19,867\n26,141\n18,211\n23,440\n24,864\n23,776\n17,746\nFinance and rental\n1,162\n1,810\n2,562\n1,337\n1,139\n1,157\n1,019\nTotal revenues\n21,029\n32,096\n28,496\n43,379\n50,223\n56,964\n47,255\nCost and expenses\nCost of Services\n--\n2,114\n3,665\n8,210\n11,551\n17,821\n16,160\nCost of Sales\n8,088\n8,416\n7,188\n8,500\n8,238\n6,582\n4,818\nSelling, gen. & admin.\n11,257\n15,878\n17,649\n20,203\n22,368\n23,215\n18,653\nResearch & development\n1,259\n1,211\n2,257\n1,701\n1,771\n1,709\n1,066\nRestructuring charge\n--\n--\n2,280\n--\n--\n4,310\n--\nTotal costs and expenses\n20,604\n27,619\n33,039\n38,614\n43,928\n53,637\n40,697\nIncome from operations\n4,477\n(4,543)\n4,765\n6,295\n3,327\n6,558\nTotal other income, net\nIncome before taxes\n4,783\n(4,460)\n5,505\n7,078\n3,921\n6,856\nProvision for taxes\n1,991\n(1,516)\n2,357\n2,902\n1,623\n2,755\nNet income\n$335\n$2,792\n($2,944)\n$3,148\n$4,176\n$2,298\n$4,101\nEarnings (loss) per share\nPrimary\n$0.10\n$0.77\n($0.54)\n--\n--\n--\n$0.71\nDiluted\n--\n--\n--\n$0.51\n$0.67\n$0.37\n$0.66\n\nExhibit 2: Lifeline Systems, Inc. - Consolidated Balance Sheets (dollars in thousands)\nDec-88\nDec-90\nDec-92\nDec-95\nDec-96\nDec-97\nASSETS\nCash and cash equivalents\n$2,195\n$7,091\n$4,053\n$3,490\n$3,030\n$2,019\nAccounts receivable, gross\n3,574\n4,248\n4,025\n6,132\n6,259\n7,622\nInventories\n2,435\n1,473\n1,581\n1,394\n1,450\n1,375\nNet investment in sales-type leases\n1,794\n2,165\n3,160\n1,992\n1,278\n1,444\nOther current assets, net\n(50)\n1,156\n8,287\n9,664\n8,888\nTotal Current Assets\n10,205\n14,927\n13,975\n21,295\n21,681\n21,348\nProperty and equipment, net\n2,711\n2,868\n3,530\n4,648\n7,127\n15,435\nOther assets\n3,216\n6,274\n8,430\n6,018\n9,101\n5,486\nTotal assets\n$16,132\n$24,069\n$25,935\n$31,961\n$37,909\n$42,269\nLIABILITIES and STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY\nAccounts payable/accrued expenses\n1,808\n1,661\n2,508\n3,583\n3,306\nAccrued payroll and payroll taxes\n1,626\n1,702\n1,743\n1,753\nAccrued restructuring charges\n--\n--\n1,460\n--\n--\n2,324\nOther Current Liabilities\n1,106\n2,061\n1,643\n1,832\n2,352\n1,645\nTotal Current Liabilities\n2,476\n5,495\n5,005\n6,042\n7,678\n9,028\nObligations under capital lease\nDeferred taxes & other liabilities\n1,994\n2,010\n1,598\n2,586\n3,508\nCommitments\nStockholders' equity\nCommon stock, $.02 par value\n10,000,000 shares authorized\nAdditional paid-in capital\n11,718\n12,138\n14,080\n15,161\n15,618\n16,340\nRetained earnings\n1,391\n4,576\n5,301\n10,975\n15,151\n17,449\nLess: treasury stock, at cost\n(735)\n(735)\n(785)\n(1,620)\n(2,923)\n(4,028)\nNotes receivable-officers\n--\n--\n(250)\n(350)\n(350)\n(100)\nCumulative translation adjustment\n--\n--\n--\n--\n--\n(72)\nTotal stockholders equity\n12,444\n16,051\n18,462\n24,289\n27,620\n29,717\nTotal liabilities and\nstockholders' equity\n$16,132\n$24,069\n$25,935\n$31,961\n$37,909\n$42,269\n\nExhibit 3: Lifeline Systems, Inc. - Three Generations of the Business\n\nR\nE\nV\nE\nN\nU\nE\nThe Hardware Co.\nThe Service Co.\nThe Information\nExchange Co."

      "content": "Massachusetts Institute of Technology\nSloan School of Management\nCenter for Information Systems Research\n\nThe ACE Project\n\nDoug Browning smiled involuntarily as he\nthought of the pleasant side of his imminent\nretirement in April 2004: more time with his\nfamily. At age 53 Doug's retirement came after\n28 years in government service and two years as\nDeputy Commissioner, second in command, of\nthe\nUnited\nStates\nCustoms\nand\nBorder\nProtection Service (CBP). Doug reflected on\nwhat should be the most important things he\ncould tell his successor, Debbie Spero. Of all his\nCBP duties, he wanted to emphasize the\nimportance and critical points for management's\nfocus\non\nthe\nAutomated\nCommercial\nEnvironment (ACE) project. Attention to the\nACE project, which was integral to business\nchange within CBP, had occupied a third of his\ntime as its lead coordinator.\nThis case was prepared by Dr. Cyrus F. Gibson, MIT Sloan School of Management, David W. Reiss, Applied Systems Technology,\nInc., and William Keevan, MBA Candidate, MIT Sloan School. This case is for the purpose of management education, rather than\nillustrating or endorsing any particular management practice. The authors thank the many managers of the U.S. Customs and\nBorder Protection Agency and affiliated contractors and agencies who contributed and commented on the case during its\ndevelopment, particularly Douglas M. Browning, Charles R. Armstrong, Sharon Mazur and Lawrence J. Rosenzweig.\n\nDoug was aware that the project was running\nover budget and had reset some of its release\ndelivery dates, but in general he felt comfortable\nabout its progress. At the same time he knew\nthat ten years of effort by so many on one of the\nlargest civilian systems projects in history\nwould be for naught if there were problems with\nupcoming Releases 3 or 4. These would deploy\nkey screens for use at points of entry on the\nMexican and Canadian borders. In the fishbowl\nworld of government, a glitch on the screen of a\ncustoms officer checking the electronic manifest\nof a truck from Mexico could be front page\nnews in the Washington Post.\n\nACE: BIG, MANY PLAYERS, AND\nMORE THAN AN IT SYSTEM\nOnce installed and successfully running, ACE\nwould be the central IT system for CBP\noperations and vital for a myriad of other\nstakeholders. ACE would be used by 42,000\nCBP personnel, thousands of corporate import-\nexport departments and freight-forwarders in the\nglobal trading network, and by dozens of other\nentities using and feeding data. ACE received its\ninitial annual appropriation from Congress in\n2000, at which time the total project was\nestimated at $1.5 billion over five years. This\nmade it one of the largest software projects\noutside the Defense Department in U.S. federal\ngovernment history.\n\nThe core of ACE's functionality was to support\nthe work of customs officers and analysts,\nparticularly the work in the field of inspection\nand duties-billing on commercial imports and\nexports. The system would replace the legacy\nsystem, the Automated Commercial System\n(ACS) and several others. Exhibit 1 shows the\nprinciple stakeholders with the information\nflows to and from ACE.\n\nIn addition to software replacement, ACE would\nenable and require a change in work practices by\nusers. Customs inspection and billing would also\nchange from transaction processing to \"account\nmanagement,\" moving from the historical\nmethod of processing individual transactions to\nan account-based approach for clearance and\nbilling purposes. Thus, if Walmart were the\nrecipient of ten thousand containers through\ntwenty ports of entry in the month of April, half\nof them requiring some import duty and dozens\ntargeted for inspection, Walmart could, under\nACE, receive a single statement of duties owed\nfor the month and a consolidated report on\ninspection rather than the thousands of electronic\nand paper documents under the old system.\n\nThe\n\"trade,\"\ncompanies\nthat\ndepend\non\nexpeditious flow of goods into and out of the\nU.S., were critical stakeholders in ACE's\nsuccess. In General Motors's supply chain, for\nexample, there were hundreds of individuals\nmanaging the delivery of millions of parts and\nvehicles. Indeed, the trillion dollars of U.S. trade\ndepended on CBP for the expeditious and\naccurate handling of goods. Starting from a\nhistory of conflict between the trade and\nCustoms, the trade-CBP relationship in 2004 had\nevolved into a partnership whereby compliant\ntraders were given a number of operational and\nbusiness concessions that were designed to ease\nthe burden of customs' activities on their\noperations. These improved processes were a\nnew part of ACE's functionality.\n\nAs a result of the terrorism strikes of September\n11, 2001, ACE had become a central part of the\nU.S. government's security efforts. Antici-\npating, tracking, monitoring and inspecting\nshipments into the U.S. all depended on a\nreliable computer system with a complex\narchitecture enabling interconnections with\nlegacy and new databases, and legacy and new\napplications systems. ACE had quickly become,\nas a result of 9/11, not just a replacement or\nmodernization driver but an essential piece of\nnational security. As a central system and for\nhistorical reasons as well, ACE required\ninterfaces with systems and interchange of data\nwith many other federal government systems,\nsuch as those of the Food and Drug\nAdministration, the Department of Agriculture,\nthe State Department and others.\n\nTo achieve its intent and take advantage of\ncurrent technology, the ACE project involved\nmajor technical innovations compared to its\nlegacy systems. For example, the various on-\nline stakeholders would use a web-based\nplatform and portal access. The basic technical\narchitecture of the system and interfaces with\nkey stakeholder groups is shown in Exhibit 2.\nExhibit 3 shows the architecture in terms of\ntechnical features. One unusual feature of ACE\ncompared to most government systems was the\nincorporation of some modules of a packaged\nEnterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system,\nnamely SAP, which had been chosen from\nseveral qualified vendors.\n\nThe technical development and implementation\nof ACE was shared by CBP with a consortium\nof some 40 vendors led by IBM and known as\nthe \"e-Customs Partnership\" (eCP). It was\nrecognized as essential that these developers\nwork closely with CBP's own technical staff in\nplanning and executing the transition from the\nlegacy infrastructure and applications to ACE.\n\nIn 2004, ACE system development was\norganizationally a key part of the Modernization\nOffice within the Office of Information and\nTechnology in CBP. CBP was a principle\nagency within the Department of Homeland\nSecurity. (See Exhibit 4 for the DHS structure,\nExhibit 5 for the CBP structure, and Exhibit 6\nfor the OIT and Modernization structure.) In\naddition\nto\nDoug\nBrowning,\nthe\nlead\ncoordinator for ACE Modernization, key players\nwere\nWoody\nHall,\nformer\nAssistant\nCommissioner,\nOffice\nof\nInformation\nTechnology;\nCharlie\nArmstrong,\nAssistant\nCommissioner, OIT; Sharon Mazur of ACE\nModernization Office, who was the project\nmanager for ACE; and Larry Rosenzweig, who\nhad particular responsibility for liaison between\nCBP field users, trade stakeholders, and the\ndevelopment teams. Browning and others\nstressed that success of the ACE project would\ndepend not only on technical development and\n(c)2004 -- Gibson, Reiss & Keevan\nPage 2\nCISR Working Paper No. xxx\n\ntechnical transition from the legacy system, but\nalso\non\nthe\nunderstanding,\nsupport\nand\nwillingness to change processes and procedures\non the part of CBP field personnel and other\nstakeholders.\n\nThe timeline of ACE releases is shown in\nExhibit 7, and consisted of the following\ncompleted and planned as of April, 2004:\n\nRelease 1, accomplished in 2000, six months\nafter contracting with the vendor consortium,\nessentially built the fundamental technology\nplatform and architecture for ACE and the\nportal technology, in preparation for Release 2.\n\nRelease 2, 18 months after contracting with\nvendors, opened the portal for use for account\npurposes, providing a test of access to all users\nvia\nthe\nweb,\nparticularly\nfor\nimporting\ncompanies to eventually see their account\ntransactions with CBP.\n\nRelease 3, scheduled for June 2004, would\ntransform\nbilling\nand\npayments\nfrom\na\nshipment-by-shipment or daily basis to a\nmonthly basis via the portal. In addition,\nRelease 3 would enable importers to make duty\npayments, currently paid on a port-by-port basis\non a national basis, for all duties due from all\nports. An important feature of ACE would be\nmanifested for the first time: the use of SAP\nmodules, in this instance particularly the finance\nmodules.\n\nRelease 4, was scheduled for November and\nDecember of 2004, and would bring to CBP\nofficers for the first time electronic access to\nmanifests for trucking crossing from Canada\nand Mexico, the US's number one and number 3\nworld trading partners. CBP officers would have\na portal that consolidated all enforcement and\ncommercial information versus having to access\nmultiple stovepipe systems. Observers noted\nthis would be the biggest and potentially most\nvulnerable release of ACE in its long history.\n\nDespite the importance and sensitivity of these\nreleases, they accounted for only 30 to 40% of\nthe total functionality of ACE. Complete\nimplementation was planned for 2008.\n\nAs of December 2003, the outsourcing costs by\nthe e-Customs Partnership were running $46\nmillion over budget, representing under 10% of\nthe firm outsourcing commitments to the e-\nCustoms Partnership of vendors, and the project\nwas six months behind schedule. On March\n23rd, CBP obtained approval for its request for\nfunding to cover the overrun.\n\nProject Manager Sharon Mazur reported in\nMarch 2004 that, in general, feedback from the\nfield and other stakeholders had been very\npositive with respect to plans and testing of\npreliminary and limited versions of the system.\n\nA LONG TIME IN COMING: THE EVOLUTION\nOF CONTEXT AND COMPLEXITY\nAs Doug Browning contemplated the focal\nissues that would affect the success or failure of\nACE, he believed issues and problems were\nrooted in the long history and increase in\ncomplexity\nof\nthe\nproject,\nand\nthat\nunderstanding this evolution was important.\n\nSince its creation as the fifth act of Congress in\n1789, the rules and procedures of the Customs\nService have been imbedded in legislation. The\nbasic customs officer's work and the forms and\ntype of data in 2004 would have been\nrecognizable to a customs officer in New York\nHarbor in 1904 or to Nathaniel Hawthorne when\nhe served as a customs inspector in Salem,\nMassachusetts around 1804. Mechanization had\ncome with the typewriter and increasingly with\nseveral\ngenerations\nof\ncomputer-based\nautomation beginning in the 1960s, but these\nchanges essentially automated the traditional,\nlegally-prescribed rules and procedures without\nchanging the process or the work. By the late\n1980s the U.S. Customs had become a\nbottleneck to trade. The value and volume of\ninternational trade had increased dramatically\n(see Exhibit 8); automated transportation and\nhandling sped up as containers came into use.\nChange in the customs practices had not kept\npace.\n\n(c)2004 -- Gibson, Reiss & Keevan\nPage 3\nCISR Working Paper No. xxx\n\nTRADE RELATIONS: FROM \"GOTCHA\" TO\nCOOPERATION\nThe customs bottleneck had serious impacts on\nthe trade. Delays and uncertainty around timing\nthe delivery of imported parts, for example,\nthrew\noff\ncompanies'\nability\nto\nmake\nbreakthrough improvements in supply chain\nmanagement, such as allowing for \"just-in-time\"\ndelivery\nof\nparts\nshipped\nfrom\nabroad.\nTransaction-by-transaction financial processing\nmeant labor-intensive clerical costs. Lost\nsavings and revenue in the billions of dollars\nwere at stake for companies and the U.S.\neconomy. The process generated confrontation,\nevasion and conflict between Customs and the\nprivate sector, described by one observer as\nCustoms playing \"gotcha\" vs. the traders\nplaying \"catch us if you can.\"\n\nCustoms staff began to conceptualize new\nprocesses. A tone was set in the early 90s by\nCustoms Commissioner Willy Von Raab's\nstrong position, who said to importers that they\nand Customs must \"automate or perish.\" These\nefforts formed the basis for ACE design:\n\nInstead of looking at each import as\n\"things\" independent of the recipient we\nbegan to think of targeting (what to\ninspect) and billing in light of 'entities,'\nthe companies that were benefiting. We\ndesigned a streamlined process by first\nlooking at a company's compliance\nhistory in the same way a credit card\ncompany examines credit history and\ncredit worthiness. We wanted to use that\nto become more selective in our\ntargeting and more comprehensive in\nour billing. Instead of inspecting based\non what was imported we would include\nwho was importing it and what their\ncompliance record had been. Instead of\nbilling for the duties on each separate\nimport we would bill monthly or\nquarterly. These approaches would\neliminate a tremendous amount of\npaperwork.\n\n--Charlie Armstrong,\nAssistant Commissioner (Acting)\nWith high expectations, in the mid 1990s\nCustoms went to Congress for approval and\nfunding of the early ACE project. At that time,\nhowever, some major and much publicized\ngovernment systems failures were occurring,\nsuch as the Social Security system and the\ndevelopment of new Internal Revenue Service\nsystems. The Customs project was rejected by\nCongress. Customs went back to the drawing\nboard, confident their conceptual redesign was\non the right track but needing new approaches to\ngain Congressional support. Meanwhile, the\ndiscontent\nwas\ngrowing\namong\ntraders\ndependent on getting goods through the\nbottleneck. The setting was right for a new\napproach. As one participant at the time put it:\n\nWe tried to get a project approved by\nCongress and it got blocked. So\nCommissioner Von Raab forced us to\nthink of new approaches. We turned to\nimporters and started to move away\nfrom the adversarial relationship with\nthem.\n\n--Sam Banks, former CBP Manager\n\nCustoms realized that they and the traders were\nin the same boat; trade companies were\nreceptive\nto\ncollaboration.\nA\nthree-year\ndiscussion began that resulted in the Customs\nModernization Act of 1993. Among other\nthings, including regulations for the new North\nAmerica Free Trade Association, the Act\nmandated that Customs and the importing\ncommunity adopt shared responsibility for\ncompliance. For Customs, this meant a policy of\n\"informed compliance\" by which they let the\nimporting community know what was expected\nof them. For the trade it meant adopting\n\"reasonable care\" in their dealings with\nCustoms, including doing their own audits,\ncreating their own offices of compliance and\noffloading work previously done by Customs\nstaff. Customs retained oversight and controlled\nthe process with rewards and penalties.\n\nIn 1997 a trade group was formalized as the\n\"Trade Support Network\" (TSN), an association\nof 170 of the largest U.S.-based importers and\nexporters which would work in a cooperative\n(c)2004 -- Gibson, Reiss & Keevan\nPage 4\nCISR Working Paper No. xxx\n\nway as a partner to Customs, dealing with issues\nand problems in a spirit of complementarity.\nRepresentatives of the TSN began to work with\nCustoms on the design of ACE, offering\nsuggestions and ideas and taking back to their\ncompanies an understanding of what such a\nsystem, should it ever be approved and\nimplemented, would mean in terms of their own\nprocesses\nand\ntechnical\ninterfaces.\nThe\nrelationship\nresulted\nin\nsome\nimmediate\nimprovements and enhancements to the design\nof ACE. Customs managers who had parti-\ncipated in this saw it as the culmination of an\nunusual evolution in the relationship of a\nregulatory governmental body with private\nbusiness entities. One experienced outsider saw\nit as quite unique and as a \"best practice\" in\ngovernment. As it turned out, improved system\ndesign and planning for implementation was just\none of the benefits of the Trade Support\nNetwork.\n\nFUNDING ACHIEVED\nShortly after the Customs/TSN relationship was\nformed, Customs managers began to engage\nTSN committees and individual companies\nwithin it--like General Motors--which were\ncritically dependent on an efficient trading\nsystem, to approach and lobby Congress to\nsupport ACE and Customs modernization. This\nled\nto\nan\ninitial\nfoundation\nfunding\nappropriation in 2001 in the amount of $130\nmillion. A program office was established and\nsystem design was begun.\n\nBEGINNINGS OF OVERSIGHT, BEYOND IT, AND\nIT OUTSOURCING\nAs TSN was partnering with Customs to fund\nACE, the nature of the project was changing.\nThe bad experience with systems development\nand systems failures elsewhere in the federal\ngovernment led to the Clinger-Cohen Act in\n1996. The act charged the General Accounting\nOffice (GAO) with the responsibility of\nreviewing IT project proposals and imposed\nsome specific principles for design and project\nmanagement. These forces, plus advances and\nnew opportunities in the technical environment,\nresulted in more enhancements to ACE design.\nThe GAO played a significant role. For one, it\nrecommended that before the project begin there\nbe an enterprise architecture approach, enabling\nthe particular system to be designed and\ndelivered in the context of other technical\nlinkages. Also, as a result of the Modernization\nAct of 1994, the GAO and Customs came\nquickly to see that the \"IT project\" initially\nenvisioned should be conceived of more as a\nbusiness change or modernization project.\nFinally, the GAO also strongly recommended\nthat Customs not attempt to build the system\ninternally, but that it be outsourced.\n\nIn 2004 Charlie Armstrong reflected on the\nimpact on IT staff in Customs of the project\nbecoming a business process change project and\non the audit and advisory role of GAO:\n\nIn the early 90s we did not understand\nthe scope and magnitude of this project.\nIt took a while before we realized 'this is\nreally big.' It was not just technical, it\nwas\nbusiness\nreprocessing.\nAs\ntechnicians,\nthere\nwas\nintimidation\nbecause there was a huge stakeholder\ngroup, the trader, who understood some\nof the newer technologies. We did not\nwant a repeat of what took place with\nACS [the legacy system] where the\nstakeholders\nin\nthe\ntrade\nwere\nscreaming at us.\nWe needed to completely change our\norientation and come up with something\nthat made business sense, or as we put it,\n'A whole new way of getting the trade\ninvolved and getting trading done.'\nThen we had the GAO people saying\nabout us, 'The folks in Customs do not\nhave the bandwidth to get this done\ninternally.' Our IT management went\nthrough a lot of soul searching...\n\n--Charlie Armstrong,\nAssistant Commissioner (Acting)\nFrom a technical standpoint, Customs designers\nof ACE observed how the Web took off in\ngeneral in the early 90s. They wanted to take\nadvantage of the Web, but were concerned\nabout the security issues.\n(c)2004 -- Gibson, Reiss & Keevan\nPage 5\nCISR Working Paper No. xxx\n\nHow do we take mission critical systems\ngoverned by laws and put them on the\nWeb where people can see the infor-\nmation and manipulate it. This challenge\nwas beyond our internal expertise and\nnecessitated the need to have an\nintegrator with that competence help us.\n\n--Charlie Armstrong,\nAssistant Commissioner (Acting)\nThe decision to outsource led to an achievement\nof some importance for the ACE project. When\nthe request for proposals (RFP) went out on\nDecember 18, 2000, vendors of considerable\nsize and experience showed interest. These\nincluded IBM, Lockheed Martin, Computer\nSciences Corporation, EDS and many others.\nRecognizing the urgency of getting the project\nunderway, a few of the leading potential prime\ncontractors got together and worked with\nCustoms to form a large vendor consortium. The\nresulting e-Customs Partnership (eCP) was\nheaded by IBM and governed by IBM and four\nother contractors. The time from letting the RFP\nto award of the contract was four months, an\nunprecedented short period. Customs received\nan award from the Interagency Resource\nManagement Conference, an association of\ngovernment agencies interacting around contract\nmanagement issues, for the effectiveness and\nexpeditious nature of the contract process.\n\nREVERBERATIONS OF 9/11\nThe scope and importance of ACE changed\nsignificantly as a result of the fallout from 9/11.\nThe creation of the Department of Homeland\nSecurity resulted in the merging of the Customs\nService, the Border Patrol and the inspection\nfunctions of the Immigration and Naturalization\nService (INS) and of the Department of\nAgriculture (APHIS). Overnight, the number of\npotential users of ACE more than doubled, to\n42,000 users. It was expected that Border Patrol\nofficers and a host of other monitoring bodies\nwould have access to ACE's information on\ngoods crossing U.S. boundaries. In addition, the\nTrade Act of 2002, emphasizing security,\nmoved the functions of security and \"targeting,\"\nthe identification of shipments entering the US\nwhich needed inspection, to the highest priority\nfor\ndevelopment\nand\nimplementation.\nIn\nparticular, it was required that any trans-border\nshipment had to have its manifest information\nsubmitted electronically prior to arrival in or\ndeparture from the U.S. This put ACE in a\ncentral role at the heart of a key part of U.S.\nnational security.\n\nCollaboration across agencies within and\noutside of DHS for purposes of improved\nsecurity checking became the highest priority. A\n\"National Targeting Center\" was announced for\nthis purpose. Information and data from very\ndifferent sources including other agencies--\nsuch as the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA),\nthe Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and\nthe U.S. State Department--would have to be\navailable and factored into the analysis of\nparticipants in the supply chain of imports.\n\nThe net effect of these changes did not increase\nthe size of ACE per se, but shifted priorities and\ncalled for extensive reorganization, rescheduling\nand more coordination of work across agencies.\nYet many saw the added urgency as a plus to the\nproject:\n\nI don't see the security emphasis as a\nproblem for us as contractors in the long\nrun. Security as a priority will bring us\ntogether better with our CBP partners on\nthe project and with all the other\nagencies' staff involved. It will still be\ndifficult, as each agency is still charged\nwith doing its own thing as well as now\ncharged with sharing and collaborating.\nThose two directives can be very hard to\nreconcile.\n\n--Brian Helmey,\nProgram Executive, IBM\nDespite the potential value of connecting ACE\nto other systems, by April of 2004 the\nDepartment of Homeland Security (DHS) had\nnot settled on the development of the National\nTargeting Center database, nor where it would\nbe housed organizationally, nor if there would\nbe a central or peripheral role for ACE. ACE\nmanagers knew if new parameters for an overall\nDHS architecture were to emerge there could be\nadded costs and delays in ACE.\n(c)2004 -- Gibson, Reiss & Keevan\nPage 6\nCISR Working Paper No. xxx\n\nCOMPLEXITY BEGETS GOVERNANCE\nBEGETS COMPLEXITY\nThese events, decisions and uncertainties had\nimportant effects on the ACE project as it was\nin 2004. The formation of the Trade Support\nNetwork had clear beneficial results in terms of\ncollaboration\nwith\nthat\ngroup\nof\nkey\nstakeholders, including not only systems design\nand potentially more effective implementation\nbut quite directly in achieving Congressional\nfunding. The collaboration among vendors in\nthe\ne-Customs\nPartnership\nrepresented\na\nsignificant improvement in time needed to line\nup outsourcers. The federal government's\ncongressional stimulus in the form of the\nModernization Act and the Clinger-Cohen Act\ncreated a basis for valuable oversight on the part\nof GAO and for thinking more broadly about\nACE as a business process change program\nrather than strictly an IT systems upgrade.\n\nAt the same time, the several roles of TCN and\ngovernment stakeholders and overseers, the\noutsourcing dependence, the criticality of ACE\nin national security, and the need for continued\nfunding justification required more rigorous and\nreliable program and project management. In\naddition to tightening its own practices in these\nareas, OIT and the Modernization Office of\nCBP engaged Mitre Corporation to provide\ntechnical guidance, oversight and independent\nvalidation of the development work. Program\nmanagement itself was enhanced by an\nengagement with the firm of Robbins-Qioia,\nparticularly in helping to control requirements\nchanges, dealing with vendors, and budget and\ntime controls. A strong indication of the success\nof these efforts came with the achievement in\n1993 of CMM Level 2 designation to CBP's\nOIT unit in the area of \"software acquisition and\nrepeatable process,\" the first of any US Federal\nGovernment agency so recognized.\n\nWhen he became Deputy Commissioner of CBP\nin 2002, Doug Browning took actions intended\nto further engage Customs' leadership in ACE\nand to reinforce the project as one aimed at\nbusiness change and not just IT replacement. In\n2004 he reflected on what he found on taking on\nhis senior position:\n\nWhen I looked closely I thought we in\nmanagement were saying the right\nthings about the importance of ACE and\nthe need to change the way we do our\nwork, but it still looked too much like an\nIT project. I wanted to make it clear that\nthe ACE project was going to be the tool\nthat would drive everything that takes\nplace in dealing with the trade,\nincluding enforcement and security.\nDoug found that most of his direct reports, the\nAssistant Commissioners, were delegating their\nrole of oversight of ACE to their staff assistants\n(see CBP organization chart, Exhibit 5). With\nthe\nCommissioner's\nfull\nsupport\nDoug\nrevamped the governance process by abolishing\nwhat were then work teams cutting across the\nCBP\norganization\nand\nputting\nall\nCBP\ngovernance under the Modernization Board (see\nExhibit 6). All Assistant Commissioners became\nModernization Board members, and all ten were\nmade to understand that the project was to be\n\"strategic\" in each of their areas of responsi-\nbility. Each was made accountable for the\nresults of their aspects of the project, and such\naccountability became part of their performance\nreviews.\n\nA second action taken by Doug was the creation\nof a \"Business Executive\" position in parallel\nwith the ACE Executive Director on the IT side,\nreporting directly to him. He filled the position\nwith Larry Rosenzweig, a manager with 31\nyears of Customs field experience. The job was\ncreated to insure that the business requirements\nwere understood by the IT developers and that\nthe business users were aware of the impact of\nreleases on their work. Rozenzweig initiated a\nseries of mechanisms to communicate, prepare\nand ensure a channel of mutual influence\nbetween the future users of ACE and the\ndesigners and developers. He created a team of\n\"ACE Ambassadors,\" 105 people from the field\nwho were trained in ACE and what it would do,\nwho then went back and informed their\ncolleagues. Larry shuttled regularly back and\nforth, providing input to the development people\nas well as the users.\n\n(c)2004 -- Gibson, Reiss & Keevan\nPage 7\nCISR Working Paper No. xxx\n\nDoug\nalso\ncreated\na\nposition\nentitled\n\"Organizational Change Management\" but by\nApril 2004 it had not been filled.\n\nThese decisions and impacts, ranging from the\ncreation of the Trade group to changes wrought\nby 9/11 to governance reinforcement and\nleadership accountabilities, were seen by those\nin Customs as having accomplished positive\nresults as intended. At the same time, each was\nalso recognized as adding complexity to ACE\nprogram management and to the process of\nachieving coordination and approval toward\nprogress. In 2004, leading stakeholder managers\nsaw project governance and management of\nACE as more complex and cumbersome than a\nsimilar project would have been even a few\nyears earlier. Exhibit 9 shows the major gover-\nnance structure and principal oversight bodies in\n2004. Sharon Mazur, project manager, estimated\nthat she spent on average a day a week in\nhearings and reviews, reporting on progress and\nanswering questions from oversight bodies.\n\nFor Mazur and others in CBP the funding\nprocess had become more burdensome and\ndifficult than before. The $46 million overrun\nby the outsourcers had resulted in a request for\npayment which CBP had submitted in August of\n2003 through the payments process. The\npayment represented outlays already made by\nthe vendors, and the delay in reimbursement had\nbecome a potentially serious bone of contention.\nThe request was finally granted in late March\n2004. It was estimated that the development and\napproval of the fiscal year 2004 expenditure\nplan, including coordination of external reviews\nand oversight questions had occupied some\n5,000 man-hours, roughly equivalent to five\npeople working full time for six months.\n\nIn addition, there was concern in 2004 over\nissues of collaboration between the outsource\ncontractors and some of the technological staff\nwithin OIT in CBP. Eventual success with ACE\ndepended critically on an evolutionary transition\nfrom the old system to the new; it was not to be\na \"big bang\" cutover. This required highly\neffective\nplanning,\ncommunications\nand\nmotivated parties on both sides. Some observers\nnoted that the potential effects of the new\nplatform and the new ACE systems on jobs of\nthe legacy technicians could be anything but\npositive, yet these experienced technicians were\nexpected to help their private contractor\ncounterparts, higher paid professionals who\nwould go on to the next big contract job when\nACE was completed.\n\nFinally, the size, criticality and interconnections\nof ACE in the politically charged government\nenvironment of 2004 meant that events like\nterrorist threats, funding priority changes and\neconomic news, all beyond ACE project and\nCBP control, could at any time have significant\nnegative effects on project delivery and on the\nvery scope and functionality of the project.\n\nDOUG BROWNING'S LEGACY?\nDoug Browning wanted to do what he could to\ncontinue CBP's commitment and effort on\nACE. He believed the results to date had been\nsuccessful. Evidence from the field for the\nanticipated upcoming releases indicated there\nwas acceptance and support and a desire to\nmake the system work. He believed there were\ngood communications between field personnel\nand the developers. Although the future of the\nIT staff in CBP was uncertain, Doug thought\nthat success with the field would set the stage\nfor those changes to be successful as well. He\nknew that much had to be done and that the\nimplementation of Releases 3 and 4 was critical\nto long term success. As he put it: \"Release\n4...that's huge...\"\n\nDoug began to draft his memo to prioritize\nissues and critical success factors for his\nsuccessor.\n\nQUESTIONS FOR PREPARATION FOR CASE\nDISCUSSION\n1. What are the three most important issues\nfacing the ACE Modernization project?\n2. What actions and approaches would you\nrecommend to Doug Browning's successor?\n3. What other questions would you ask of CBP\npersonnel to improve your understanding and\nrecommendations?\n(c)2004 -- Gibson, Reiss & Keevan\nPage 8\nCISR Working Paper No. xxx\n\nExhibit 1: Stakeholder Information Flows\n\nExhibit 2: Ace System Architecture--Functional View\nAutomated Commercial System (ACS)\nAutomated Export System (AES)\nBorder Release Advanced Screening\nand Selectivity (BRASS)\nCustoms Automated Forms Entry System (CAFES)\nFast and Secure Trade (FAST)\nPre-arrival Processing System (PAPS)\nEnterprise Information Portal\nTrade\nAccess Points\nSecurity\nApplications\nData\nWeb Access via Common User Interface\nCBP\nUsers\nACE will replace\nACS, AES, BRASS,\nCAFES, FAST, PAPS\nACE will interface with\nAPIS, ATS, IBIS,\nNCIC, TECS\nLegacy Systems*\nModernization Systems\nCustomer\nRelationship\nManagement\nMission\nSystems\nBusiness\nIntelligence\nEnterprise\nResource\nPlanning\nAccount\nManagement\nImport\nTransactions\nExport\nTransactions\nPassenger\nTransactions\nEnforcement\nSelectivity\nRevenue\nAccounting\nCase\nManagement\nBusiness\nData\nAnalytic\nData\nLegacy\nDatabases\nAccount\nImport/Export\nPassenger\nEnforcement\nReference\nSelectivity\nFinancial\nHuman Resources\nInventory\nTrade\nPublic\nAccess Points\nSecurity\nApplications\nData\nPublic\nICE\nUsers\nShared Databases\nPublic\nAccess Points\nSecurity\nApplications\nData\nGovt\nAgencies\nAdvanced Passenger Information System (APIS)\nAutomated Targeting System (ATS)\nInteragency Border Inspection System (IBIS)\nNational Crime Information Center (NCIC)\nTreasury Enforcement Communications System (TECS)\n*Legend\n\n(c)2004 -- Gibson, Reiss & Keevan\nPage 9\nCISR Working Paper No. xxx\n\nExhibit 3: ACE System Architecture--Technical View\nTrade Systems\n(ABI, AMS, etc.)\nTrade Systems\n(ABI, AMS, etc.)\nTrade Systems\n(ABI, AMS, etc.)\nSeparation of Data, Business Rules & Processes\nProvides: Security, Flexibility, Expandability & Scalability\nApplication\nBusiness\nLogic\nSecurity / Systems Management\nEnterprise\nPortal\nServlet\nXML\nHTML\nExternal\nSystem\nInterface\nIntegration\nLogic\nLegacy/\nModern\nApplication\nBusiness\nLogic\nModern\nBrowser\nClient\nWeb & Interface Tier\nData Tier\nEAI Tier\nSeparation of Data, Business Rules & Processes\nProvides: Security, Flexibility, Expandability & Scalability\nApplication\nBusiness\nLogic\nSecurity / Systems Management\nEnterprise\nPortal\nServlet\nServlet\nXML\nXML\nHTML\nHTML\nExternal\nSystem\nInterface\nIntegration\nLogic\nLegacy/\nModern\nLegacy/\nModern\nApplication\nBusiness\nLogic\nLegacy\nSAP\nCRM\nR/3\nLegacy\nDBMS\nRDBMS\nBRD\nDW\nBrowser\nBusiness\nRules\nEngine\nODS\nEDM\nEPP\nOLAP\nWorkflow\nApp Tier\n\nExhibit 4: U.S. Department of Homeland Security Organization\nSecretary\nTom Ridge\nCitizenship and\nImmigration\nOmbudsman\nDirector of\nShared Services\nAsst.
