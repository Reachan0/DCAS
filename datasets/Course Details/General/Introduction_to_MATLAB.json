  "course_description": "This course was offered as a non-credit program during the Independent Activities Period (IAP), January 2008. A more recent version is available as course 18.S997 Introduction To MATLAB Programming, including video lectures.\nThe course, intended for students with no programming experience, provides the foundations of programming in MATLABÂ®. Variables, arrays, conditional statements, loops, functions, and plots are explained. At the end of the course, students should be able to use MATLAB in their own work, and be prepared to deepen their MATLAB programming skills and tackle other languages for computing, such as Java, C++, or Python.\nThe course mostly follows the official MATLAB Manual, available from The MathWorks. We will cover material from chapters 2-5.",
