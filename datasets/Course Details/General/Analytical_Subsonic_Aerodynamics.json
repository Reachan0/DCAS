Fluids, Vol. II, pp. 2524-2532.\nMoran (1965), Cornell University thesis.\n2 BACKGROUND AND INTRODUCTION\nIn the absense of friction and heat conduction (small gradients in velocity and temperature are as\nsumed), an isentropic disturbance will propagate without change in shape. The particle velocity\nunder these conditions is governed by the wave equation:\n∂2u\n∂t2\n∂2u\n= a1 ∂x2\n(2.1)\nwhose solution may be expressed as:\nu(x,t) = F (x - a1t) +G(x + a1t)\n(2.2)\nThe wave propagates at the local speed of sound a1, where a1 is a constant.\nAn acoustic wave of finite amplitude will propagate with shape being distorted in the process. The\ntheoretical description is expressed in terms of non-linear equations. The wave speed for acoustic\nwaves of finite amplitude is\n\n3 γ + 1\nc = a1 ±\nu\n(2.3)\nn\nh3 ρ γ-1\nio\nγ + 1\nc = a1 1±\n- 1\n(2.4)\nγ - 1\nρ1\nThus, the regions of higher condensation, ( ρ ) > 1, tend to overtake those of lower condensation.\nρ1\nThis non-linear steepening effect resulting from the convective terms of the equations of motion is\n\neventually balanced by the diffusive terms. The diffusive terms become important as the velocity and\ntemperature gradients become larger (steepening effect). When complete balance is obtained, the\nwave is then \"stationary\" and propagates without further distortion.\nThus, for acoustic waves of finite amplitude one may anticipate two time scales. Physically the time\nscales would correspond to (a) the time in which the non-linear convective terms determine the na\nture of the wave propagation and (b) the time in which the diffusive terms are of the same order as\nthe non-linear convective terms.\n3 THE LINEARIZED SOLUTION\nWe shall discuss the formation of weak plane shock waves by impulsive motion of a piston as treated\nby Moran and Shen (JFM, 1966). In this problem we also have two time scales. After the piston is set\nin motion the wave propagation is governed by the viscous diffusive terms resulting from the steep\ngradients in flow initially. This part of the wave propagation constitutes a time scale. The second\ntime scale is characterized by the non-linear convective terms balancing the viscous diffusive terms,\nthe initial gradients being smaller on this scale.\nUsing a continuum flow formulation Moran and Shen consider the phenomenon for time large com\npared with the mean time spent by a gas molecule between collisions. Denoting the piston Mach\nnumber by 2 the linearized Navier-Stokes equations may be shown to be valid up to time of the order\nof 1/22 mean free times after the piston is set in motion. At large times the solution may be shown\nto be governed by Burgers's equation. Boundary conditions for the large time solution are obtained\nby applying the matching principle of the method of inner and outer expansions. In their analysis\nMoran and Shen assumed 2 to be small; the gas is viscous and heat conducting.\nThe basic equations and non-dimensionalization are:\n∗\n∗\n∗\nμ = 2\nq\nRT0\n∗ μ,\nρ = ρ0(1+ 2ρ)\n(3.1)\n∗\n∗\np = p0 (1 + 2p),\nT ∗= T0\n∗ (1+ 2T )\n(3.2)\nwhere ( )∗ denotes a dimensional variable, R is the gas constant. 2 is a perturbation parameter,\ndefined so that μ = 1 on the piston. 2 is proportional to the piston Mach number. ( )0 enotes the\nundisturbed value of the variable.\nThe viscosity is given by\n∗\n∗\nμ = μ0(1+ 2μ)\n(3.3)\nThe dimensionless independent variables x and t are given by\nn\nq\no\n∗\n∗\n∗\nx = μ0/ρ0\nRT0\n∗ x\n(3.4)\nn\no\n∗\n∗\n∗\nt = μ0/ρ0 RT0\n∗ t\n(3.5)\nThe exact Navier-Stokes conservation equations in a one dimensional unsteady flow may be written:\nρt + μx + 2(ρμ)x = 0\n(3.6)\nh\ni\nμt + px - μxx + 2 ρμt + μμx - (μμx )x + 22ρμμx = 0\n(3.7)\n\n⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n⎪\nh\ni\nh\ni\nγ\nγ\nTt +(γ-1)μx -\nρTt +μTx +(γ-1)pμx -(γ-1)μ - (μTx )x +2 ρμTx +(γ-1)μμ\n= 0 (3.8)\nTxx +2\nx\nx\n∇\n∇\np = ρ + T + 2ρT\n(3.9)\nwhere\nγ = specific heat ratio\n∇= Prandtl number (based on the longitudinal viscosity)\nThe initial conditions for the piston problem are:\nμ = ρ = p = T = 0,\nx > 0,\nt = 0\n(3.10)\nFor an impermeable and adiabatic piston, the boundary conditions are (at the piston)\nμ = 1,\nTx = 0,\nx = 2t,\nt > 0\n(3.11)\nAt infinity, the damping conditions are imposed\nμ,ρ,T -→ 0,\nt > 0,\nx →inf\n(3.12)\nThe linearized solution is obtained by letting 2 →inf. As expected from the physics of the problem, by\nletting 2 →inf the non-linear convective terms are lost and the first order viscous diffusive terms are\nretained. Our equation system reduces to the following linear set of equations:\no\nρo\nt + μ = 0\n(3.13)\nx\no\no\no\nμt + p - μ\n= 0\n(3.14)\nx\nxx\no\nγ\nT o + (γ - 1)μ -\nT o = 0\n(3.15)\nt\nx\nxx\n∇\no\np = ρo + T o\n(3.16)\nThe initial conditions and boundary conditions reduce to:\no\nμ = ρo = T o = 0,\nx > 0,\nt = 0\n(3.17)\no\nμ = 1,\nT o = 0,\nx = 0,\nt > 0\n(3.18)\nx\no\nμ ,ρo ,T o -→ 0,\nt > 0,\nx →inf\n(3.19)\nIn equations (3.13) to (3.19), the superscript o denotes the linearized solution or outer variables.\nWe solve for the linearized dependent variables by using Laplace transforms:\nZ inf\no(x,s)\n-st\nμ\n=\ne\nμ o(x,t)dt\n(3.20)\nThe general formulae for the asymptotic behavior of the solution (real world) are\n⎧\nh\ni\np\np\n⎨μ o(x,t) ~\nerfc (x - γt)/ 2βt + o(t- 2\n1 )\n⎪\nρo (x,t)\n~\np μ o (x,t)+ o(t- 1\n2 )\n(3.21)\nγ\n⎪\n(γ-1)\n⎩T o(x,t)\n~\np\nμ o(x,t)+ o(t- 2\n1 )\nγ\nγ - 1\nβ ≡ 1+\n(3.22)\n∇\n\n⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n⎪\nThe linearized solution indicate a shock-like behavior at large times, i.e. the flow properties eventu\nally exhibit a smooth transition between differing constant values. Also, the center of the transition\npropagates at the speed of sound (local) and the Pankine-Hugoniot relations are satisfied.\nLet\nq\np\nX = (x - γt)/ 2β\n(3.23)\nThe asymptotic behavior of the linearized solution may be written:\n⎧\nh\np i\n⎨μ o(x,t) ~\n1erfc X / t + o(t- 2\n1 )\n⎪\nρo (x,t)\n~\np μ o (x,t)+ o(t- 2\n1 )\n(3.24)\nγ\n⎪\n(γ-1)\n⎩T o(x,t)\n~\np\nμ o(x,t)+ o(t- 1\n2 )\nγ\no\nWe also note that the relation between μ ,ρo ,andT o is the same as that obtained by solving the prop\nagation of isentropic, infinitesemal amplitude wave problem (the one-dimensional wave equation).\np\nFrom equation (3.24) we note that the width of the transition zones grows in time like\nt. The width\nof a weak shock in steady flow, in the above notation, is of order of 1/2. Physically, we expect the solu\ntion of the piston problem to yield a steady (convective and diffusive terms enter to the same order)\np\ntravelling shock as t →inf. This suggests that the linearized solution will break down when\nt = o 1\nor t = o( 2\n2 ). A more formal argument leading to the above result is given in Moran (1966).\n4 THE SOLUTION AT LARGE TIMES\nWe now define an \"inner region\" where t is of the same order or greater than 1/22. In the inner\nregions the \"inner variables\" and their derivatives are of order unity in the limit 2 → 0. Since the outer\n\nvariables for large time are of order unity, they need not be rescaled or stretched. The independent\nvariables must be stretched:\nτ = 22t\n(4.1)\nTo rescale the distance we note that for large time, i.e. inside the inner region, the outer solution may\nbe approximated by their asymptotic expansions. This means that outside the \"shock\" everything is\nconstant and our interest should be directed toward the shock interior. Hence as t →inf or τ →inf, we\ncenter the inner distance coordinate with the shock and stretch it by 2 to make the shock thickness\non the inner scale to be order unity. Hence\np\nq\nξ = 2(x - γt) = 2 2βX\n(4.2)\nSubstituting equations (4.1) and (4.2) into Navier-Stokes equations one obtains a redundant system\nof equations to first order in 2. The redundancy is a result of stretching the x-coordinate as to make\nthe inner equations inviscid to first order. Expanding the inner dependent variables in a power series\nin 2 - e.g.\ni\ni\ni\nμ = μ0 + 2μi\n1 + 22 μ2 + ...\n(4.3)\nand substituting equations (4.1), (4.2), and (4.3) into the Navier-Stokes equations, we obtain\ni\ni\ni\ni\nμτ + (γ + 1)μ μ = βμ\n(4.4)\nξ\nξξ\n(Viscous dissipation - no dispersion)\nEquation (4.4) is Burgers's equation.\nThe boundary conditions for equation (4.4) is obtained by matching the inner and outer solutions:\n(μ i )o = (μ o )i\n(4.5)\nThe inner solution is re-expressed in outer variables and re-expanded in 2 for fixed x and t, the result\nought to be the same as if the outer solution were put in inner variables and re-expanded for fixed ξ\nand τ.\nWe obtain as initial conditions for μ i :\n(\nμi (ξ,0) = 0,\nξ > 0\n(4.6)\nμ i (ξ,0) = 1,\nξ < 0\nHence on the inner scale we have an initial value problem. First we transform μ i :\ni\n2β\nΨξ\nμ = -\n(4.7)\n(γ + 1) Ψ\nCombining equations (4.4), (4.6), and (4.7) and integrating over ξ, we find\nΨξ = βΨξξ\n(4.8)\n(\nΨ(ξ,0) = exp(-(γ + 1)ξ/2β),\nξ < 0\n(4.9)\nΨ(ξ,0) = 1,\nξ ≥ 0\nEquation (4.8) is the heat equation. Solution can be obtained by disturbing heat sources along the\nξ-axis. See Moran (1966). The inner solution when matched to the outer solution shows that the\nasymptotic matching principle is satisfied (as opposed to the limit matching principle).\n\nThe composite solution is given by\n(\nμc = μ i + μ o - (μ i )o\nc\ni\n(4.10)\nμ = μ μ o /(μo )i\np\n·\n-1\nexp[(γ + 1)/2β(ξ - 1(γ + 1)τ)]er f c[ξ/\n2βτ]\nui (ξ,τ) = 1+\np\n(4.11)\ner f c[(ξ - 1(γ + 1)τ)/ 2βτ]\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu/\n16.121 Analytical Subsonic Aerodynamics\nFall 2017\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: https://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

With t1 = -1, we have\nt = s + 2t1(s)+ ... = s - 2\nso\nt = s - 2\nor\ns = t + 2\nHence, substituting\nc1\nc1\nx(t;2) ∼\n|s(t) =\ns\nt + 2\nc1 = arbitrary constant\nNote the uniformity condition at the first order led to the correct change of variables and the\nexact solution.

Extension to three dimensions is straightforward. We week the\nleading terms in a series expansion in 2 of Φ.

Thus,\nΦ0\n0 = x\n\nSubstituting, we obtain:\n(1- Minf\n2 )Φ\n+ Φ\n= 0\nixx\nizz\np\nΦ0 + Φ0 → 0,for x2 + z2\nix\niz\nThe remaning boundary conditions belong to the inner region and are to be obtained by matching.\nWe assume:\nΦi = Uinf\n£\nΦi\n0(x,z )+ 2Φi\n1(x,z ) + 22Φi\n2(x,z ) + ...\n¤\nz = z/2\nThe stretching enables us to focus on the flow in the immediate neighborhood of the airfoil in the\nlimit of 2 → 0 since the airfoil shape then remains independent of 2 and the width of the inner region\nbecomes of order unity.\nThe zeroth-order inner term is that of a parallel flow, that is:\nΦi\n0 = x\n(Both inner and outer flow must be parallel in the limit 2 → 0.)\nExamining the W-velocity component in the inner region, we may write:\n£\n¤\ni\ni\ni\ni\nW = Φ = Φ = Uinf Φ (x,z )+ 2Φ (x,z )\nz\nz\n1z\n2z\nSince Q must vanish in the limit of zero 2, Φi\n1 must be independent of z .

We need to match the inner and outer solutions.\nWe will employ the asymptotic matching principle to complete the required matching.\nFrom Φi above we note that W i is independent of z to lowest order. Thus, in the outer limit at z = inf,\nwe have:\nd f u\nW i 0\ni\n= Φz (x,inf) = 2\ndx\nand\nW 0 = 2Φ1z\nEquating the inner limit (z = 0+), we obtain:\nd f u\nΦ (x,0+) =\n1z\ndx\nd\nfl\nΦ (x,0-) =\n1z\ndx\nMatching the potential, we find:\ng 1u (x) = Φ1(x,0+)\nTo determine g 2 it is necessary to include higher order terms in the outer solution.\nFirst, we write the two-term outer flow in inner variables,\n¡\n¢\nΦ0 = Uinf x + 2Φ0\n1(x,2z )+ ...\nTaking the three term inner expansion of this:\n¡\n¢\nΦ0 = Uinf x + 2Φ0\n1(x,0+)+ 22z Φ0 (x,0+)+ ...\n1z\nRewriting the above equation in outer variables:\n¡\n¢\nΦ = Uinf x + 2Φ1(x,0+)+ 2zΦ (x,0+)+ ...\n1z\nThe three-term inner expansion, expressed in outer variables, reads:\n¡\nd f u\n¢\nΦi = Uinf x + 2g 1u (x)+ 2z\n+ 22g 2u (x)+ ...\ndx\nNow equate the two-term outer expansion of the three term inner expansion:\n¡\nd f u\n¢\nΦi = Uinf x + 2g 1u (x)+ 2z\n+ ...\ndx\nTo the three term inner expansion of the two-term outer expansion leads to:\ng 1u = Φi\n0(x,0+)\nd f u\nΦ0\n1z (x,0+) = dx\nAnd Cp takes the following form:\nCp = -22Φ1x (x,0±)\n\n\"+\" → upper surface\n\"-\" → lower surface\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu/\n16.121 Analytical Subsonic Aerodynamics\nFall 2017\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: https://ocw.mit.edu/terms."
