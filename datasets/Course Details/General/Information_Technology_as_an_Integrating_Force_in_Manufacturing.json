  "course_description": "In virtually every industry and every firm, information technology is driving change, creating opportunities and challenges. Leaders who donâ€™t understand at least the fundamentals of information systems will be at a strategic disadvantage. This course provides broad coverage of technology concepts and trends underlying current and future developments in information technology, and fundamental principles for the effective use of computer-based information systems. There will be a special emphasis on manufacturing. Information Systems topics that will be covered include networks and distributed computing, including the World Wide Web, hardware and operating systems, software development tools and processes, relational databases, security and cryptography, enterprise applications, B2B, the semantic web and electronic commerce. Sloan LFM students with an interest in Information Systems are encouraged to register for this course.",

  "syllabus_content": "Course Meeting Times\n\nLectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session\n\nPrerequisites\n\nThis course assumes only a minimal familiarity with computer technology and terminology. The course is not intended for students who have extensive technical expertise or experience.\n\nReadings\n\nThe course material is available in the course reader. It includes all the required readings (articles) to be covered in class. Most of the optional readings are available via the Web, although a few are included in the course pack. There are also some optional textbooks and recommended Web material. And there will be some additional material handed out in class.\n\nGrading\n\nClass Participation: 50%\n\nAssignments: 25%\n\nTake Home Exam: 25%\n\nAssignments\n\nWe view this course as a cooperative learning experience and expect students to engage the topics through hands-on assignments, readings, and thoughtful discussions in the classroom. Class preparation is essential for case based sessions. Assignments provide an opportunity to gain hands-on experience with some of the tools and technologies covered in this course. They include (a) working with a Microsoft Access database (b) writing a twenty-line simple program for a very simple computer designed specifically for this assignment (c) a two-page web description of an IT application used in manufacturing (d) an agenda to help you keep up with IT and (e) a take-home final exam. All assignments are to be received before class on the due date.",

(5 points) Before embarking on an IT manufacturing cost reduction process (such as the\none Stanley Stanzyk leads at Intel) you will make sure you understand what is the\nforecasted ROI. True or false? Please justify your answer.\n9. (5 points) Why is computer vision not more widely used in manufacturing and robotics?\n10. (5 points) How can RFIDs impact manufacturing?\n11. (20 points) Why is it hard to build information technology for a marketplace so that the\nIT functionalities developed add value to the steel industry players?\n12. (20 points) Rod Brooks painted a very bright future for Robots.\na) Do you agree with his vision? True or false (please explain your answer)\nb) How will they impact manufacturing?\nc) How will you make sure that you are up to date with robotics technology so that\nyou are the first one to realize there is potential to apply it within your\nmanufacturing responsibilities?\n13. (25 points) Remember that we merged the Personal Agenda assignment with the final.\nHere is the personal agenda question inspired on the original assignment. It builds to a\ncertain extent on the previous question.\na) How will you keep up to date with developments in information technology?\nb) What will you do if you feel there is a business issue that relates to technology\nand you feel you need to drill down into some technology specifics that you do\nnot understand?"

The topic of\nyour paper is relatively flexible, but based upon the survey earlier this year, we have identified the\nfollowing areas of interest:\nDESIGN\nMAKE\nMANAGE\nSELL\nBUY\n-\nSCM\n\n& RFID\ntechnology\n- Global yield\nmanagement\n- Security of WW\nnetworks\n- Outsourcing\n- Network integration\n- Data Transfer on the\nShop Floor\n-\nInspection\n- Data consistency\n- WIP visibility\n- Headcount monitoring\n- Data warehouses\n- Managing information\nin design of complex\nsystems\n- Concurrent engineering\n- Data visibility and\nvisualization\n-\nRecycling\n-\nERP\nWe are asking students (or teams) to submit a short (no longer than one paragraph) description of\ntheir project topic by lecture no. 9. When coming up with a topic, please bear in mind that the scope\nshould be consistent with the page requirement of 2 pages / person. Therefore, if you are working\nalone, your paper should be approximately 2 pages long (and groups of 3 would be 6 pages, etc.).\nWe have created a forum within the server to assist people in forming project teams or\ncollaborating on a project with a student with similar interests. In either case, the ultimate\ndeliverable for your project is to create a web site, summarizing your findings. Send the URL of\nyour web site on the day of lecture no. 19.\nYour paper should cover at least (but not be strictly limited to) the following areas:\n- Description of the Manufacturing Business Issue\n- Description of the technology\n- What should managers know about this technology\n- Process based view of the issues involved (such as \"before\" and \"after IT\" processes)\n- Data based view of the issues involved (such as the standards that are required)\n- Internet links\n\nGrading will be based on the depth of your analysis, the quality of your supporting data, and the\nweb-based presentation of your analysis, argument, and recommendations. The distribution of\nthe grade will be based on 25% for the presentation quality of the web site, and 75% on its\ncontent.\nEffective projects will demonstrate knowledge of both the underlying technology\nbeing applied and its business implications. You can do the webpage in any program you want\nsuch as word or frontpage.\nFor those students taking the 9-unit version of this course, we expect that the scope of the report\nwill be significantly longer and more in-depth. Students taking the 9-unit version of this course\nshould do their webpages using frontpage. There will be a recitation on frontpage."

However, few see any immediate advantages in the\nnew technology. The traders are satisfied with today's buying\nprocess, and ascribe the expected increase in e-commerce to IT\ndevelopment in general.\nSteelscreen's task will be to add customer values in this new\nchannel.\nWhy should you buy metal on the Internet?\nIt is the future\nEasy to find information.\nDo not want to be left behind.\nNot good enough!\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND\nRECOMMENDATIONS\nSteelscreen has to prove to future customers that e-commerce\nsaves time and money.\nA great barrier against e-trading metals is that buyers are afraid\nto abandon the personal contact with suppliers. To make traders\nuse Steelscreen it has to have a vivid brand with a \"face\" and\nstand for certain values. Buyers have to trust Steelscreen\nconcerning:\nReliable deliveries\nBest price\nQuality\nAble to solve complex problems\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND\nRECOMMENDATIONS\nSteelscreen must not forget brand building within traditional\nchannels: a strong trademark there is essential for future buyers\nto find the web site. Steelscreen must own the concept of \"metal\ntrading on the Internet\".\nOur view is that the web site should be constructed so that a\npersonal relationship between the buyer and Steelscreen is\ncreated. One way to do this would be to have a virtual person\nhosting the site, such as Hera Qraft or Miss Boo."
