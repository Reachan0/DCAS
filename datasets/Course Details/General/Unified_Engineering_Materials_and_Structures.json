  "syllabus_content": "Course Meeting Times\n\nLectures: 1 hour / session, 5 sessions / week\n\nRecitations: 1 hour / session, 2 sessions / week\n\nPrerequisites\n\n18.02 Calculus II: Multivariable Calculus\nand\n8.01 Physics I: Classical Mechanics\n\nCorequisites\n\n16.002 Unified Engineering II: Signals and Systems\nand\n18.03: Differential Equations\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn the MIT Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics and Unified Engineering (Unified), aerospace engineering is taught within the context of the CDIO (Conceive-Design-Implement-Operate) framework. Our goal is to educate future leaders in the field who can contribute to the development of new products in a modern, team-based environment. In addition to learning the disciplinary material and acquiring the technical foundations of aerospace engineering, you will begin learning skills that will enable you to become an effective aerospace engineer.\n\nCourse Objectives\n\nThe basic objective of Unified is to give a solid understanding of the fundamental disciplines of Aerospace Engineering and to give insight into their interrelationships and applications. In the fall, these disciplines are Materials and Structures (16.001) and Signals and Systems (16.002). In the spring, the disciplines are Fluid Dynamics (16.003) and Thermodynamics (16.004). This course 16.001 is the first course in the Unified series.\n\nThe second objective of Unified is to guide you toward an understanding of the fundamental skills, knowledge, and sensitivities that are the traits of a successful engineer. These include the skills necessary to work successfully in a group (including technical and graphical communication) and those of self-education (reading, research, and experimentation). Professional engineers have the knowledge and confidence to make estimates of poorly known parameters, create conceptual models of systems, assess the applicability of various models and their resulting solutions to encountered problems, and design new solutions to meet technical challenges. Aerospace systems in particular are very unforgiving; one can do 99.5% of the job well, but it is the error in the remaining 0.5% that may cause a major accident or failure. Aerospace engineers are known for their attention to detail and, while we do not expect perfection, we do expect that all work carried out as part of Unified Engineering be done with care and as well as possible given the time constraints of the course.\n\nSeparate but Unified:\nWhile the disciplines have separate course numbers and will receive separate letter grades, Unified is nonetheless taught with a significant amount of unification. This includes the structure (assignments, quizlets, exams) as well as the grading policy of the individual courses. As such, the contents of this section apply equally to 16.001-16.004. Also, we will have topics that are not specifically about a single discipline, but yet will be taught by one of the disciplinary faculty. This is, in particular, true for some of the labs which often bring together more than one discipline and/or involve some aspect of design.\n\nTeaching Methods:\nThe Unified Engineering Team is firmly committed to helping you learn. This commitment takes many forms, including a process of continuous improvement in our teaching effectiveness. During this semester, the faculty will be exploiting teaching methods proven to increase students' learning. These methods include presenting information to the student in the context of a compelling challenge or problem, stressing active versus passive learning in the classroom, enhancing feedback to the student, providing multiple opportunities for hands-on learning, etc.\n\nLearning and Grades:\nLearning is a lifelong endeavor, whereas learning for grades is often quite temporary (i.e. the material often is not remembered as time after an exam increases). Further, while pursuing learning for a lifetime ability, one tends to acquire an understanding that is demonstrated in typical assessment activities, such as exams, and thereby one achieves the grades representative of the learning level desired and as expressed in the definition of grades at MIT (see below). We strongly encourage you to view all activities within Unified as opportunities for learning with the final goal of having you prepared for your career after Unified.\n\nTextbooks\n\nS. Crandall, N.

Jones,\nEngineering Materials 2: An Introduction to Microstructures and Processing\n, Pergamon Press, 1986. ISBN: 9780080325323.\n\nM. F.

ISBN: 9780256114256.\n\nAssignments, Quizlets, and Exams\n\nProblem Sets:\nA sample homework solution is provided illustrating the proper way to write up a problem solution. Doing homework helps to engage with the concepts and material taught in class on a deeper level. To enhance the learning process, we strongly suggest that you first try to solve the problems by yourself.\n\nQuizlets [not available to OCW users]:\nEach week there will be a quizlet on the material covered in the past week. This will be a combined 50-minute exam. The questions will cover examples, previous homework questions, and recitation questions from the past week. Please note that the order of the subjects will not be the same from week to week. The quizlet problem will be drawn from (1) problems from any past problem set for which the solutions have been posted, (2) problems worked in lecture or recitation, or (3) problems included in assigned reading for which solutions have been made available. The quizlet problems will be identical to the problems from (1), (2), and (3) except possibly for some simplifications (to allow for solving the problem in the allotted quizlet time). When taking the quizlet, you will not have any materials available to you (e.g. no \"cheat sheets\"). For equations, etc. that we would not expect you to know from memory, they will be provided with the quizlet.\n\nLabs:\nLabs will often require working on a team of two or more Unified students. The lab report details and submission procedure will be specified for each lab.\n\nExams:\nThere will be an in-class 2-hour midterm and a final exam for each course.\n\nAcademic Honesty\n\nA fundamental principle of academic integrity is that you must fairly represent the\nsource\nof the intellectual content of the work you submit for credit. In the context of Unified Engineering, this means that if you consult other sources (such as fellow students, TAs, faculty, literature, old problems from prior years) in the process of completing homework, system problems, and labs, or any other assignment, you must acknowledge the sources in any way that reflects true ownership of the ideas and methods you used.\n\nDoing homework helps to engage with the concepts and material taught in class on a deeper level. To enhance the learning process, we strongly suggest that you first try to solve the problems by yourself and then discuss challenges in groups or in office hours if necessary. Discussion among students and office hours to digest the material and the homework problems or to prepare for laboratories or exams is considered useful in the educational process and copies of problems and exams of previous years will be made available by the instructors on the Unified website. Collaboration on homework is allowed unless otherwise directed as long as all references (both literature and people) used are named clearly at the end of the assignment. Word-by-word copies of someone else's solution or parts of a solution handed in for credit will be considered cheating unless there is a reference to the source for any part of the work that was copied verbatim. Failure to cite the contribution of another student to your homework solution will be considered cheating. Official Institute policy regarding academic honesty can be found in the MIT Bulletin Course and Degrees Issue under \"\nAcademic Procedures and Institute Regulations\n.\" The\nAcademic Integrity Handbook\n, a guide for students published by the Office of the Dean for Undergraduate Education, contains additional information that may be helpful.\n\nUnified Study Group Guidelines\n\nStudy groups are considered an educationally beneficial activity. However, at the end of each problem on which you collaborated with other students, you must cite the students and the interaction. The purpose of this is to acknowledge their contribution to your work. Some examples follow:\n\nYou discuss concepts, approaches, and methods that could be applied to a homework problem before either of you start your written solution. This process is encouraged. You are not required to make a written acknowledgment of this type of interaction.\n\nAfter working on a problem independently, you compare answers with another student, which confirms your solution. You must acknowledge that the other student's solution was used to check your own. No credit will be lost due to this comparison if the acknowledgment is made.\n\nAfter working on a problem independently, you compare answers with another student, which alerts you to an error in your own work. You must state at the end of the problem that you corrected your error on the basis of checking answers with the other student. No credit will be lost due to this comparison if the acknowledgment is made and if no direct copying of the correct solution is involved.\n\nYou and another student work through a problem together, exchanging ideas as the solution progresses, but you each write up your own solution. Each of you must state at the end of the problem that you worked jointly. No credit will be lost due to this cooperation if the acknowledgment is made.\n\nYou copy all or part of a solution from a reference such as a textbook or the homework archive available on the Unified website. You must cite the reference. Partial credit will be given since there is some educational value in reading and understanding the solution. However, this practice is strongly discouraged and should be used only when you are unable to solve the problem without assistance.\n\nYou copy verbatim all or part of a solution from another student. This process is not considered academically dishonest if the acknowledgment is made. However, you will receive no credit for verbatim copying from another student as you have not made any intellectual contribution to the work you are submitting for credit.\n\nVERBATIM COPYING OR USE OF ANY MATERIAL WHICH YOU SUBMIT FOR CREDIT WITHOUT REFERENCE TO THE SOURCE IS CONSIDERED TO BE ACADEMICALLY DISHONEST and will be treated as such.\n\nGrades\n\nThe rules of the MIT faculty define grades in terms of the degree of mastery of course material. These definitions are listed in the Bulletin and will be applied in this course. The following is the MIT policy on assigning grades to students.\n\nPassing Grades:\nUndergraduate and graduate students who satisfactorily complete the work of a subject by the end of the term receive one of the following grades:\n\nA: Exceptionally good performance demonstrating a superior understanding of the subject matter, a foundation of extensive knowledge, and skillful use of concepts and/or materials.\n\nB: Good performance demonstrating the capacity to use the appropriate concepts, a good understanding of the subject matter, and an ability to handle the problems and materials encountered in the subject.\n\nC: Adequate performance demonstrating an adequate understanding of the subject matter, an ability to handle relatively simple problems, and adequate preparation for moving on to more advanced work in the field.\n\nD: Minimally acceptable performance demonstrating at least partial familiarity with the subject matter and some capacity to deal with relatively simple problems, but also demonstrating deficiencies serious enough to make it inadvisable to proceed further in the field without additional work.\n\nUse of letter grades on submitted work and participation\n: The work you submit and overall participation in Unified will receive a numeric grade based on the MIT grade point scale as described below. Specifically, you will receive grades for:\n\neach individual problem on a problem set\n\neach exam\n\nlab assignments\n\nThe mapping from numerical to letter grades is as follows: 5 = A, 4 = B, 3 = C, 2 = D, 0 = F. +/- modifiers are set at 0.2 grade points. For example, your grade on a midterm might be a 4.4. This grade is between an A- (4.8) and B+ (4.2).\n\nWeights will be assigned to the individual problems on problem sets. Most problems will be of equal unit weight value; however, particularly long and/or challenging problems could be given increased weight value (e.g. a weight of 2 would be twice the default problem value). Using these weights, a weighted overall grade point for homework will be determined.\n\nUnified course grade\n: The Unified course grade will be defined based on your \"Unified grade point average\" with a weighting of 20% for problem sets and labs, 20% for quizlets, 25% for the midterm, and 35% for the final exam. Specifically, the final course letter grades will be assigned using this numeric Unified grade point average, as well as considering the distribution of your grades throughout the semester. At a minimum, you will receive a course letter grade that is equal to the maximum letter grade that your numeric course grade is above. For example, if your numeric course grade is 4.3, you would at least receive a B+ for your course letter grade.",

The free end x = L is\nconstrained from extensional motion by a ring housing (i.e. the displacement u(L) = 0\nat the extremity A). After testing a first design, it was found that friction between the\nbar end and the housing produced unacceptable heating of the material surfaces.

The truss lab is focused on\ncomparing theoretical predictions with experimental data for a Howe truss structure. This\nlab complements the theory lectures in Unified Materials & Structures.\n1.1\nMeasurable Outcomes:\nThe measureable outcomes of this lab are as follows:\n- MO1: To determine Young's Modulus, yield strength, ultimate strength, and elon\ngation at failure for an unknown material from data obtained from material tensile\nstrength testing\n- MO2: To uniquely identify a material by using experimentally obtained values for its\nmaterial properties along with Ashby charts and materials databases\n- MO3: To determine the loads acting upon a physical structure using load cells\n- MO4: To contrast and compare theoretical versus experimental loads and displace\nments for a simple \"planar\" truss structure\n\nMaterial Tensile Testing Lab\nIn this lab, you will perform tensile testing on four different dogbone shaped specimens,\neach made of a different material. The testing will be done using a Zwick machine (a more\npopular machine brand is Instron which is not available to us for this test). This machine will\napply a tensile load to the specimen and increase it steadily until the material fails. During\nthe process, the force applied is measured by a load cell and the elongation displacement\nis measured by sensors which know the location of the device loading surfaces with high\nprecisions. The data is recorded by specialized software throughout the duration of the test.\nAn example of a material dogbone specimen is shown in Figure 1. A separate test will\nbe performed for each specimen. Based on the data you obtain from the tests, you must\ndetermine which four materials the provided dogbones are made up of. These four materials\nare included as a subset of the master list of materials provided in Appendix A.\nFigure 1: A Dogbone Specimen on which tensile testing will be performed\n\n2.1\nDirections for Tensile Testing\nThe directions for the lab are as follows:\n1. Pickup a set of four material dogbone samples from the lab instructor, and use the\nprovided calipers and weights scales to determine the dimensions, volume, and density\nof the material samples.\n2. Once you are done, the lab instructor will place your sample in the Zwick machine, and\nrun the program to perform the tensile test, until the dogbone fails. The tensile test\nwill be performed for each of the four dogbone samples, resulting in load-displacement\ndata for each of the four samples. You will need to convert this data to a stress-strain\ncurve, identify several important parameters, and ultimately determine which dogbone\ncorresponds to which material.\n3. Take the raw data from your test session at the end of the test. The computer used\nto run the Zwick and store the raw data is not connected to the internet,\nso please bring a USB.\nDuring the tensile testing, you may want to take note of any \"special\" events occurring\nduring the test session. The material samples will be stressed to different points along their\nstress-strain curve, so it may be helpful to correlate any physical observations you make\nduring the test to points in the data you receive afterwards.\n2.2\nSafety Instructions for Tensile Testing\nPlease acknowledge the following safety procedures:\n- Safety glass are located outside of the testing lab, and inside as well. Please make sure\nto wear one upon entering and performing the tensile tests.\n- Be sure to wear close-toed shoes and long pants to enter the lab\n- Follow the instructions of the laboratory instructor.\n\nTruss Lab\nIn this lab, we will load two Howe trusses and compare the theoretically predicted and\nexperimentally observed loads experienced by three of the truss members (Members 5, 6,\nand 7 in Figure 3). A schematic of our Howe truss (consisting of two geometrically identical\ntrusses) is shown in Figure 2, with dimensions given.\nFigure 2: Howe Truss Geometry\nThe lab setup for the Howe truss in this lab is shown in Figure 3. Our particular truss\ngeometry consists of four bays of the same length. The height of each bay is equal to its\nlength of 0.5 meters. The intervening members have the same length as the length of each\nbay (0.5 meters). Additionally, the overall span is 2 meters. Testing will be performed on\ntwo different trusses; one made of steel and one made of aluminum.\nThe lab will take place in the AeroAstro Building 33 Hangar. The lab will be performed\nin groups of four to five students over the one hour period, with two groups present for each\nlab session. For the first half of the period, one group will perform testing on the steel truss\nwhile the other performs testing on the aluminum truss. Afterwards, the groups will perform\ntesting on the other truss, so that data is obtained for both the aluminum and steel truss.\nThe truss systems utilized in this test are configured so that the \"planar truss\" assumption\nused in the model holds. The following assumptions can be made about the actual truss\nconfiguration:\n1. The system is simply supported by a pin and a roller (no static indeterminacy).\n2. The load that the structure must support is evenly distributed between each of the\ntwo 2D-trusses. Thus, for each two-dimensional truss, the applied load P is modeled\nas a point load, equal to half of the total load 2P , concentrated at the joint at the\nmid-span of the truss.\n\nFigure 3: Howe Truss Lab Setup\n3. The normal assumptions associated with \"idelalized planar (two-dimensional) trusses\":\n(a) All bars are straight\n(b) Bar joints are frictionless pins\n(c) Bars have no mass\n(d) All loads and reactions are applied at the joints\n(e) Loads in truss members are aligned with the member axis, and thus, carry only\naxial forces\nThe idealized configuration of our truss experiment is shown in Figure 3.\nFigure 4: Idealized Howe Truss Configuration. The internal forces in members 5, 6, and 7\nwill be measured and compared to theoretical predictions.\n\n3.1\nDirections for Truss Lab\nThe directions for this lab are as follows:\n1. Before the lab: Perform a hand calculation to determine the expected loads in\nMembers 5, 6, and 7 as shown in Figure 3 (hint: use the method of sections for\ntruss analysis). Your loads should be represented as a function of the applied load P .\nNote that we will follow the standard convention where positive loads correspond to\nmembers in tension, and negative loads correspond to those in compression. Record\nthese predicted loads and bring them to your scheduled truss lab test session.\nWe also recommend that you bring a laptop to the lab. This will allow you to perform\nyour analysis in real time and record your data in a spreadsheet.\n2. A TA or instructor will be present at the lab and will give you a summary of the\noperation of the setup, and will then instruct your group on how to check the calibration\nof the load cells.\n3. Make sure that all the read outs in all of the acquisition channels are at zero when the\ntruss is unloaded.\n4. Apply up to five different load levels on each truss setup (the values of these loads\nare up to you but should NOT exceed the maximum allowable load indicated in the\nlab).\nYour task is to record the applied load at each level and the resulting loads\nin Members 5, 6, and 7, as well as the corresponding vertical displacement\nof the truss. Additionally, you are to apply each load level for a total of five\ndifferent trials. Thus, you should have 25 different trials (5 trials for each\nload level). These trials should be performed on BOTH the aluminum and\nsteel trusses.\n5. Data analysis and comparison with model: groups must share the recorded data. Each\nstudent must make sure they have a complete set of data after the test. Perform a\npost-experiment analysis of the data as follows in the next section.\nPlease provide the following deliverables, labeling axes and provide legends\nwhere appropriate for plots:\n1. For each sensor 5, 6, and 7, create a plot of the measured load vs. applied load. On\nthe same figure, plot the results for all five tries in each truss. Use one color/line style\nfor the aluminum truss results and another for the steel truss results. Include a legend.\n2. In each of the three figures, add a plot of the theoretical values of the loads on the\nrespective bar as a function of the applied load (use a different color/line style).\n\n3. Include this figure in your report and comment of the observed variability of the results\nacross the different tries and for the two different trusses. Should the two trusses give\nthe same results? Why or why not? Do you observe any type of systematic experimen\ntal errors? What about random errors? What is the order of the experimental error\nyou observe for each sensor in the two trusses?\n4. Compare the experimental results with the theory predictions. Quantify the discrep\nancy between model and experiments and comment on the possible sources of discrep\nancy. What is the maximum difference observed between the two?\n5. Create a fourth figure with a total of 10 plots, 5 load displacement curves corresponding\nto the tries for each truss. Again, use color/line style for the aluminum results and\nanother for the steel results.\n6. Write up your results and submit to Stellar.\nDeliverables\nPlease write up a report containing the following items:\n1. Description of the material tensile test, all calculations, measurements taken, the re\nsults including plots of the stress-strain curves obtained and inferred mechanical prop\nerties for the materials, and, finally, the conclusions about the materials you think you\ntested based on a comparison to the candidate list.\n2. Description of the truss lab, all hand calculations, and answers/plots for the ques\ntions/deliverables in the Truss Lab section.\n\nAppendices\nA\nAppendix A: Candidate List of Materials\nEach of the four mystery materials is represented in this master list of 25 materials; it is\nyour job to find out which ones they are!

Tropical Balsa Wood\n\nB\nAppendix B: Analyzing Material Tensile Strength\nTesting Data\nFor each material, you will obtain the following tabulated data in a spreadsheet:\n- Load experienced by the material sample in Newtons\n- Elongation of the material sample in millimeters\nAdditionally, you will also be able to calculate the cross-sectional area of the material sam\nple.\n- Correction of measured elongation data\nIn general, depending on the utilized measurement technique, the collected elongation\ndata may not directly correspond to the actual elongation of the tested specimen.\nFor instance, in the setup of our tensile testing machine, we actually measure the\nvertical displacement of the crosshead of the testing machine. This displacement is not\nexactly equal to the actual elongation of the tested specimen. Among other things,\nthe elongation measured in this way also accounts for the elongation of (a part of) the\ntesting rig. In order to avoid this issue, more sophisticated measurement techniques\ncan be used, for instance extensometers or optical devices that are applied directly to\nthe thin section of the tested specimen.\nTherefore, in case of our measurement technique, it can be helpful to correct the\nmeasured raw elongation data by removing the part pertaining to the elongation of the\ntesting rig which will yield more accurate values for the actual elongation of the tested\nspecimen. One relatively coarse approach to do this is to assume that the stretched\npart of the testing rig behaves like a linear spring of stiffness krig and that that spring\nis connected in series to the tested specimen. This scenario is depicted in Figure 5.\nConsider the following quantities:\n- Elongation of specimen: δ = L - L0\nLrig - Lrig\n- Elongation of testing rig: δrig =\n- Stiffness of testing rig (Hooke's law): krig = F/δrig\nδ + δrig\n- Total measured elongation: δtotal =\nTherefore, the elongation δ of the specimen can be determined from the measured total\nelongation δtotal as follows:\nF\nδtotal - δrig\nδtotal -\nδ =\n=\n(1)\nkrig\n\nL0\nLrig\nLtotal\nkrig\nk\nLtotal\nF\nF\nk\nkrig\nL\nLrig\nFigure 5: Left-hand side: serial connection of the unstretched specimen and the unstretched\ntesting rig (depicted as a spring); right-hand side: serial connection of the stretched specimen\nand the stretched testing rig.\n\nFor our tensile testing machine, the following approximate value for the stiffness of the\ntesting rig was found:\nN\nkrig ≈ 4,000\n(2)\nmm\nUsing the outlined approach, more realistic values for the Young's moduli and the\nelongations at failure (which are described in the following) pertaining to the tested\nspecimens can be obtained.\n- Stress-strain curve\nIn order to obtain the desired material properties, you will need to convert the Load\nvs Elongation data into a Stress vs Strain curve. The axial stress, since we are loading\nour material samples along a longitudinal axis, is given by\nF\nσ =\n(3)\nA\nwhere F is the applied load, and A is the cross sectional area of the material.\nAdditionally, strain is the change in length, L, of a material under a given load, nor\nmalized by its original length L0. In our tensile testing experiment, it may also be\nregarded as the elongation of the specimen, normalized by the original length L0, so\nthat\nL - L0\nδ\nε =\n=\n(4)\nL0\nL0\nwhere δ is the elongation, L0 is the original length of the specimen, and L is the current\nlength of the specimen.\nAny property that is related purely to stress values (e.g. yield stress and ultimate\nstrength) should be determined from a plot of Stress vs Strain as measured from the\nmachine using Equation 3. Any property that that requires some measurement of\nstrain (e.g. Young's Modulus and elongation at failure) should be determined from\nyour best estimate of strain, from Equation 4, over time.\nPlotting the Stress vs Strain curve will allow you to see the elastic and plastic re\ngions within the material more clearly, and should yield something that resembles the\nbasic shape shown in Figure 6. This plot shows the strain as recorded by the tensile\nstrength testing machine (you will only receive force-elongation data from the machine,\nwhich you will need to postprocess into stress vs strain). Some materials may not ex\nperience a plastic region and may experience a brittle failure, so that the stress-strain\ncurve may look quite different from Figure 6.\nSome notes on computing each of the desired material parameters:\n\nStress = F\nA\nStrain hardening\nNecking\nYield stress\nFracture\nUltimate strength\nElastic limit\nElastic modulus (slope)\nδ\nStrain =\nplastic strain\nL\nFigure 6: Stress-Strain curve\n- Calculating Young's Modulus\nRecall that the Young's Modulus is the ratio of the stress to strain when a material\nis in its elastic regime - that is the linear region along the stress strain curve. In this\nregion, the material can be thought of as a linear spring, because the material returns\nto its initial shape after being loaded and unloaded.\nThus, the Young's Modulus can be determined by calculating the slope of the linear\nportion of the stress-strain curve shown in Figure 6.\n- Calculating Yield Stress (or Yield Strength)\nThe yield stress corresponds to the point where the transition from elastic to plastic\ndeformation begins. If the material is stressed beyond this point, it will not return to\nits original shape, but will instead stay \"stretched\" (think of stretching a plastic bag\nit stays stretched after you let go!). With respect to the stress-strain curve, this point\ncorresponds roughly to the point where the curve stops behaving linearly.\n- Calculating Ultimate Stress (or Ultimate Strength)\nThe ultimate stress/strength is the maximum stress that the material can withstand.\nThis corresponds to the maximum stress value achieved on the stress-strain curve.\nBeyond this point, the material's load bearing capabilities begins to rapidly deteriorate.\nAfter moving beyond this point, you will potentially observe a phenomenon called\n\"necking\", where the width of the material rapidly decreases as the sample stretches\nand approaches complete failure.\n\n- Calculating Elongation at Failure\n\"Failure\" refers to the moment when the test sample breaks - that is, it is no longer\na simple sample, but rather two or more pieces (typically two in an axial testing\nmachine). On the stress-strain curve, this corresponds to the point where the curve\nabruptly ends. This is a result of the material no longer being able to carry any load\nat all.\nA Final Note:\nFinally, it should be noted that we are assuming that the cross section of the specimen is\nnot changing during the extension. Hence, what we are plotting is not a true stress-strain\ncurve, but rather an engineering stress-strain curve.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu/\n16.001 Unified Engineering: Materials and Structures\nFall 2021\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: https://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

Coyn, \"A Study of Airplane Ranges and Useful\nLoads,\" NACA Report No. 69, 1919, with no reference to Breguet. It\nconcludes that the reason for the association of the Range Equation with\nthe name Breguet \"...is historically obscure.\"\n\nDerivation of the Breguet Range Equation I\nEquilibrium or momentum conservation: During level flight, the aircraft\ntravels at a constant ground speed V (m s-1) and altitude, see figure:\nUnder these conditions, the propulsive force or thrust T (N) equals the\naerodynamic drag force (D), and the aerodynamic lift force L (N) equals\nthe total weight W (N):\nT = D , L = W , (N)\n(1)\nYou will study in Fluids in the spring that the drag and lift are related and\nthat in level flight, the ratio of the two can be considered constant. This\n\nDerivation of the Breguet Range Equation II\nallows us to relate the vertical and horizontal equilibrium equations, and\nthus the thrust and the weight as follows:\nL\nL\nL\nW = L =\nD =\nT , W =\nT , (N)\n(2)\nD\nD\nD\nNote that L/D is a measure of the aerodynamic eyciency of the aircraft.\nMass balance: At any point during flight, the total weight of the aircraft\n(W ) is the addition of the weight of the structure (Ws ), the weight of the\npayload (Wp ), and the weight of the fuel (Wf ):\nW = Ws + Wp + Wf , (N)\n(3)\nThe maximum total weight of the aircraft when the fuel tanks are full and\nunder full payload is typically referred to with the acronym MTOW, or\nmaximum take-o weight. Also, during flight, the total weight W changes\nas the fuel mass is expended. So the total aircraft weight as well as the fuel\n\nDerivation of the Breguet Range Equation III\nweight can be thought of as functions of time t or also distance traveled R.\nThe change can be written mathematically as follows:\ndW\ndWf\n=\n= -m f g , (N s-1)\n(4)\ndt\ndt\nwhere m f (kg s-1) is the fluid mass flow rate assumed constant in level\nflight, and g ∼ 9.81 m s-2 is the acceleration of gravity on earth (also\nassumed constant).\nEnergy balance: The main consideration here is that the fuel energy is\nexpended in producing the thrust which is necessary to counterbalance the\ndrag. The propulsive power Pp is:\n-1\n-1\nPp = T × V , (N m s\n= J s\n= Watt)\n(5)\nThe power is provided by the combustion of the fuel, which has an amount\nof energy per unit mass hf (J kg-1), and could in principle provide a fuel\npower Pf :\nPf = m f × hf ,\nkg s-1 × J\nkg-\n1 = Watt)\n(6)\n(\n\nDerivation of the Breguet Range Equation IV\nHowever, and as you will study in detail in Thermodynamics and Propulsion,\na number of losses occur in the process of converting the chemical energy\navailable in the fuel to the final propulsive power. We refer to the fraction\nof the fuel power e ectively contributing to propulsive power as the total\neyciency η0:\nPp\nη0 =\n(7)\nPf\nand our energy balance principle can be written as:\nPp = η0Pf , or TV = η0m f hf , (Watt)\n(8)\n\nDerivation of the Breguet Range Equation V\nWe note that mass conservation Equation (4) gives us information on how the\nweight W changes over time t, not distance traveled R. However, distance\ntraveled and time are related by: dR = V , and we can use the chain rule to write:\ndt\ndW\ndW dR\ndW\n=\n=\nV = -m f g\n(9)\ndt\ndR dt\ndR\n| {z }\nfrom(4)\nThis expression can be combined with energy balance Equation (8), as follows:\nm f\nT\nfrom (8):\n=\n(10)\nV\nη0hf\ndW\nm f\nfrom (9):\n= -g\n(11)\ndR\nV\ncombining:\ndW = -g T\n(12)\ndR\nη0hf\n\nDerivation of the Breguet Range Equation VI\nThe final step is to now recognize that we haven't used our equilibrum (or\nmomentum balance) Equation (2), which gives: T =\nW . Combining this with\n( L\nD )\nEquation (12), we get:\ndW\ngW\n= -\n(13)\ndR\nη0hf L\nD\nThis equation has the form:\ng\nW 0(R) = aW (R),\nwhere the constant coeycient : a = -\nL\n(14)\nη0hf D\nIt constitutes a first-order ordinary di erential equation with constant coeycients\nand governs the evolution of the weight of the aircraft W as a function of\ndistance traveled R. It can be easily integrated by noting that:\n(ln f (x))0 =\n1 f 0(x)\n(15)\nf (x)\n\nDerivation of the Breguet Range Equation VII\nand therefore Equation (14) can be written as:\nW 0(R) = (ln W (R))0 = a\n(16)\nW (R)\nintegrating:\nln W (R) = aR + C\n(17)\nNow comes the important step of applying the initial condition, or known point\nin the solution W (R). What we know, is that at the beginning of the flight\n(distance traveled R = 0), the weight of the aircraft is the total weight with full\nfuel tanks:\nW (R = 0) = Winit = W0 + Wfuel\n(18)\nEvaluating Equation (17) at the known solution point:\nln W (R = 0) = a0 + C , → C = ln Winit\n(19)\nReplacing in Equation (17):\n\nW\nln W (R) - ln Winit = aR, → R(W ) =\nln\n(20)\na\nWinit\n\nDerivation of the Breguet Range Equation VIII\nReplacing the value of a from Equation (14):\nη0hf\nR(W ) = -\nL\nD\n\nln\nW\n(21)\ng\nWinit\n\nR(W ) = hf\ng\nL\nη0 D ln Winit\nW\n(22)\nthe factor h\ng\nf should define the dimension of the right hand side as all other\nfactors are non-dimensional. Let's check this using SI units: hf has units of\n-2\n2 -2\nenergy per unit mass, or in SI: J kg-1 = kg m s m\nkg-\n1 = m s , g has\nunits of length per time squared, or in SI: m s-2 . Then, the ratio hf /g in SI\n-2\ns\nm2\nhas units:\n-2 = m. We conclude that this factor has dimensions of\ns\nm\n\nlength and gives the dimension of the right hand side.\nPhysically, this factor represents the eyciency of the fuel in terms of the\nenergy density per unit mass. Clearly, a fuel with a higher value of hf would\nincrease the range, ceteris paribus. Typical values of hf for jet fuel is around\n\nDerivation of the Breguet Range Equation IX\n40MJkg-1 . The equation also tells us that gravity a ects the range in an\ninversely-proportional manner.\nThe factor η0 has already been discussed and represents the propulsive\neyciency of the engine. Typical values for modern propulsion systems are\naround 0.2 - 0.4.\nthe factor D\nL is non-dimensional and represents the aerodynamic eyciency\nof the aircraft design. Typical values of D\nL in modern aircraft are around\n15 - 20.\nthe factor inside the logarithm W\nW\ninit represents the ratio of the sum of the\nstructural Ws , payload Wp , and initial fuel Wf weights to the current total\nweight.\nThe maximum range Rmax for a given aircraft is obtained from Equation\n(22) when the initial weight Winit = MTOW, and all the fuel weight has\nbeen expended Wf = 0, in which case W = W0 = OEW\n\nhf\nL\nMTOW\nRmax =\nη0\nln\n(23)\ng\nD\nOEW\n\nDerivation of the Breguet Range Equation X\nClearly, MTOW plays the role of a structural eyciency of the aircraft design,\nOEW\nand calls for lighter and lighter aircraft where as much as possible of the\nweight is devoted to the fuel.

All along, one of the key assumptions\nwas that equilibrium could be stated in the undeformed configuration of the\nstructure and that the results would also hold in the deformed configuration.\nStructural instabilities have their origin in nonlinear effects that arise as a\nconsequence of dropping this assumption and stating equilibrium in the\ndeformed configuration.\nThe simplest and perhaps most important instability from the standpoint of\nAerospace engineering is the Buckling of Slender Beams or Columns under\ncompressive loads.\n4/48\n\nBuckling of Beams I\nConsider a rigid rod of length L hinged at Point A\nwhere a torsional spring of stiffness kT provides the\nonly deformable element of the system according\nto the relation M(θ) = kTθ between the internal\ntorque on the spring and the rotation angle θ.\nThe beam is loaded with two concentrated\nloads Q and P, as shown in the figure.\nWe are interested in analyzing the equilibrium of\nthe bar in the deformed configuration. In this case,\nthis simply requires matching the external and\ninternal moments with respect to A, which gives:\nQ cos(θ)L + P sin(θ)L = kTθ\nThis gives the full nonlinear response. The figure\non the right shows Q = Q(θ) for different values\nof P and kT = 1, L = 1.\nL\nQ\nP\nθ\nkTx1\nx2\nA\nπ\nθ\nQ\nP = 0\nP = 0.33\nP = 0.66\nP = 1\nP = 1.3\n5/48\n\nBuckling of Beams II\nWe are not interested in the nonlinear behavior for\nlarge θ, where Q grows unbounded because it\nloses it's moment arm, but rather, in the response\nfor very small θ, which is almost linear. The\nlinearized solution is obtained by simply\napproximating cos θ ∼1, sin θ ∼θ, which gives:\nQ =\nkT\nL -P\n\nθ\nπ\nθ\nQ\nP = 0\nP = 0.33\nP = 0.66\nP = 1\nP = 1.3\nWe can see that the main effect of the compressive load P is not to \"drive\" the\ndeformation but to decrease the stiffness of the system, since it reduces the\nslope of the response curve at the origin. In the linearized model, when\nP = Pcr = kT\nL , the system has no stiffness and it can be in equilibrium for any\nvalue of θ under zero lateral load Q, which means that the structure is\nunstable. For P > Pcr, the effective stiffness of the structure is negative (what\ndoes this mean?). We therefore see that it is the compressive force P, that\naffects the stability of our structure, the lateral force Q does not play a role. A\nmore useful view is then to consider the autonomous (undriven) system\n(Q = 0), and explore how P affects the characteristics of the system (stiffness).\n6/48\n\nBuckling of Beams III\nP sin (θ) = kT\nL θ\nπ\nθ\nP\nThis is the essence of the analysis of\nlinearized stability of structures:\nstate equilibrium in the deformed configuration\nlinearize the equations\nstudy the autonomous (undriven) system loss of stiffness\n7/48\n\nBuckling of Beams\nThis can be rearranged as\nQ =\nkT -PL\nL\n\n|\n{z\n}\n= keff\nθ = keffθ\nwhere keffis an effective torsional stiffness.\nNote: Here, the load affects the stiffness; as P is being increased, keff\ndecreases.\nImportant value for P: If P = kT/L, then keff= 0!\nThis is the point of \"static instability\" or \"buckling\".\nTerminology:\neigenvalue = value of load for static instability\neigenvector = displacement shape / mode of structure\n(These terms will be revisited later.)\n8/48\n\nBuckling of Beams\nNow, assume that only P acts and the rod is in a position θeq of static\nequilibrium.\nThen, perturb θeq by a small amount ∆θ, and release the rod.\nIf the rod returns to θeq: The position θeq is a stable equilibrium.\nIf the rod moves away from θeq: The position θeq is an unstable\nequilibrium.\n9/48\n\nBuckling of Beams\nFor instance, consider θeq = 0 and ∆θ > 0 so that θ = θeq + ∆θ = ∆θ:\nL\nP\nθ\nkT\nx1\nx2\n∆θ\nA\nX\nM(A) = 0 :\n⇒\n-P sin(∆θ)L + kT∆θ = -IA\n|{z}\n>0\nθ\n⇒\n-IA θ = (kT -PL) ∆θ\nNote:\n-IA θ acts counterclockwisely (towards θeq = 0)\n+IA θ acts clockwisely (away from θeq = 0)\nTherefore, if the rod is released from θ = ∆θ:\nIf kT > PL ⇒stable, θ →θeq = 0 (due to friction)\nIf kT < PL ⇒unstable, θ →inf\nCritical point:\nPcrit = kT\nL\nSpring cannot provide a sufficient restoring force.\n10/48\n\nBuckling of Beams\nResponse of rod with torsional spring to compressive load P:\nb\nb\nb\nb\nb\nb P\nθ\nA\nB\nD\nD\nC\ngoes to +inf\ngoes to -inf\nPcrit = kT/L\nθ\nkT\nP\nABC\nequilibrium path but not stable\nABD\nequilibrium path, deflection grows unbounded (\"bifurcation\")\n(B is bifurcation point; 2 possible equilibrium paths)\nNote: If P is negative, the stiffness will increase.\n11/48\n\nBuckling of Beams\nResponse of rod with torsional spring to perpendicular load Q:\nθ\nkT\nQ\nQ\nθ\nkT/L\n12/48\n\nBuckling of Beams\nResponse of rod with torsional spring to loads along and perpendicular to rod:\nQ\nP\nθ\nkT\nP\nθ\nP = kT/L (for Q = 0)\nQ increasing\nDifferent initial angles θ0 = Q/(kT/L)\nNote:\nIf Q and P are removed prior to instability, spring brings bar back to\noriginal configuration (as structural stiffnesses do for various\nconfigurations).\nBifurcation is a mathematical concept.

Its non-trivial solutions (where\nu2(x1) = 0) comprise the unknown eigenvalues P and the corresponding\neigenvectors u2(x1). The latter are also called mode shapes and actually\nfunctions for continuous eigenproblems, not vectors.\nSolve Eq.

These components are the\nprojections of the vector on the basis vectors:\nv = vj ej\nTaking the dot product with basis vector ei :\nv.ei = vj (ej .ei ) = vj δji = vi\n\nTransformation of basis\nGiven two bases ei , ek and a vector v whose components in each of these bases\nare vi and v k , respectively, we seek to express the components in basis in terms\nof the components in the other basis. Since the vector is unique:\nv = v m em = vnen\nTaking the dot product with ei :\nv. ei = v m(e m. ei ) = vn(en.e i )\nBut v m(e m.e i ) = v mδmi = v i from which we obtain:\nv i = v. ei = vj (ej .e i )\nNote that (ej . ei ) are the direction cosines of the basis vectors of one basis on\nthe other basis:\nd\nej . ei = kej kk ei k cos ej ei\n\nPermutation tensor, cross product I\nPermutation Tensor:\n⎧\n⎪0\nwhen any two indices are equal\n⎨\nεmnp =\nwhen mnp is an even permutation of 1, 2, 3\n⎪\n⎩-1 when mnp is an odd permutation of 1, 2, 3\nDefinition\nEven permutation\nOdd permutation\n\nPermutation tensor, cross product II\nExamples\nε123 = ε231 = ε312 = 1, ε213 = ε321 = ε132 = -1, ε112 = ε233 = ε222 = · · · = 0,\nSource and usefulness: Cross products of cartesian basis vectors\ne1 × e1 = 0, e2 × e2 = 0, e3 × e3 = 0,\ne1 × e2 = (+1)e3, e2 × e3 = (+1)e1, e3 × e1 = (+1)e2,\ne1 × e3 = (-1)e2, e3 × e2 = (-1)e1, e2 × e1 = (-1)e3,\nThese can all be captured by\nei × ej = εijk ek\n\nPermutation tensor, cross product III\nExample\ne1 × e2 = ε121 e1 + ε122 e2 + ε123 e3 = e3\n|{z}\n|{z}\n|{z}\n=0\n=0\n=1\nWe can also observe that\n(ei × ej ) · ek = (εijl el ) · ek = εijl δkl = εijk\nThe permutation tensor can be used to express some of the other familiar\nvector operations involving cross products.\nCross product of two vectors\nv × w = (vi ei ) × (wj )ej ) = vi wj (ei × ej ) = vi wj εijk ek\nMixed or triple product of three vectors\n(v × w) · u = vi wj εijl el · (uk ek ) = vi wj uk εijk\n\nPermutation tensor, cross product IV\nSince the triple product can also be obtained from the determinant of the 3x3\nmatrix made of the components of the three vectors (either arranged in row or\ncolumn form), we can use this to express the determinant of a 3x3 matrix A\nwith components aij as follows. Assign the rows of the matrix to the\ncomponents of the vectors above as follows: vi = a1i , wj = a2j , uk = a3k , then:\nDeterminant of a 3x3 Matrix\n|A| = a1i a2j a3k εijk\n\nOutline\nMathematical preliminaries\nIndicial notation and summation convention\nVectors\nTransformation of basis\nConcept and uses of stress at a point\nStress at a point\nStress tensor\n\nInternal forces and equilibrium I\nConsider a body in equilibrium under external surface and body forces:\nS\nn\nsurface forces\nbody forces\nS\no\nR\nMo\ndf\nr(x)\nbody forces\nWe imagine a cut through the body with a plane defining the surface internal\nsurface S with normal n. The FBD on the right shows the resultant internal\nforce (R) and moment (Mo ) required from equilibrium for the left part. We\nassume that these are provided by the collective action of infinitesimal\npointwise forces df acting on the points of S.\n\nInternal forces and equilibrium II\nR and Mo are therefore obtained as the following integrals:\nZ\nR =\ndf\nS\nZ\nMo =\nr × df\nS\nIt should be clear that t is a force per unit area defined at each point of surface\nS obtained as the limiting value of the resultant force f acting on a (finite)\nsurface area element ΔS when this tends to zero.\n\nStress Vector I\nDefinition\nThe stress vector at a point on ΔS is defined as:\nf\nt = lim\n(1)\nΔS→0 ΔS\nNotes:\nThe integral of the stress vector in the area defines the resultant internal\nforce necessary to keep the left side in equilibrium (as we discussed before)\nZ\nR =\ntdS\nS\nSimilarly, the resultant internal moment vector Mo with respect to a point\no is given by:\nZ\nMo =\nr × tdS\nS\n\nStress Vector II\nIn other words, the internal force and moment vectors are the equipollent force\nsystem corresponding to the colective action of the continuously distributed\nstress vectors t on the cut surface.\nIf the cut had gone through the same point under consideration but along a\nplane with a different normal, the stress vector would have been different. Let's\nconsider the three stress vectors t(i) acting on the planes normal to the\ncoordinate axes.\ne2\ne3\ne1\nx1\nt(1)\nx2\nt(2)\nx3\nt(3)\nσ11σ12\nσ13\nσ21 σ22\nσ23\nσ31σ32\nσ33\n\nStress Vector III\ne2\ne3\ne1\nx1\nt(1)\nx2\nt(2)\nx3\nt(3)\nσ11σ12\nσ13\nσ21 σ22\nσ23\nσ31σ32\nσ33\nLet's also decompose each t(i) in its three components in the coordinate system\nei (this can be done for any vector) as (see Figure):\nt(i) = σij ej\n(2)\nσij is the component of the stress vector t(i) along the ej direction.\n\nIntroduction of the Stress Tensor I\nDifferent planes passing through the point with different normals will have\ndifferent stress vectors t(n).

A\nmathematical relation between the components of the stress and the strain\ntensor is sought.\nWe have already discussed the\nuniaxial stress test and the general\ncharacteristics of the corresponding\nstress-strain curve relating the\napplied normal stress component\nσ11 and the corresponding normal\nstrain component ε11.\nσ11 = E ε11\nWe will look into this in more\nδ\nL\nA\nF\nε = δ\nL\nσ = F\nA\nE\ndetail.\nThis expression describing the linear response of materials in the elastic regime\nis known as Hooke's law. This particular form applies only to a state of uniaxial\nstress. In general each and every component of the stress tensor σij can depend\non each and every component of the strain tensor εij . We will generalize\nHooke's law to general states of stress and strain.\n\nGeneralized Hooke's law I\nA general linear relation between stress and strain components can be written\nas:\nσij = Cijkl εkl\nCijkl are the components of a fourth-order tensor known as the elasticity tensor.\nTransformation of tensor components upon change of basis\nCan show that basis transformation rules for fourth-order tensors are analogous\nto tensors of any order (including vectors), i.e., given the representation of\ntensor C in two different bases ei , ej :\nC = Cijkl ei ej ek el = Cmnpq em en ep eq\nTaking dot products with basis vectors ei four times, we find:\nCmnpq = Cijkl ( em · ei )( en · ej )( ep · ek )( eq · el )\n\nGeneralized Hooke's law II\nSymmetries of the elasticity tensor How many different coefficients are there in\na fourth order-tensor? . However, for the special case of the elasticity tensor,\nthere are symmetries that reduce their number significantly.\nImplications of symmetry of stress tensor.\nThis reduces the number of coefficients\nto 54, since:\nσij = σji\nCijkl εkl = Cjikl εkl , ⇒\nC\nijkl\n(Cijkl - Cjikl ) εkl = 0\n|{z}\n\n3x 3x3x3 = 81\n\n|\n{z\n}\nCijkl = Cjikl\n6x3x3=54\nImplications of symmetry of strain tensor.\nThis reduces the number of coefficients\nto 36, since:\nεij = εji\nCijkl εkl = Cijkl εlk = Cijlk εkl , ⇒\nC\nijkl\n|{z}\n(Cijkl - Cijlk ) εkl = 0\n\n3x 3x\n3x 3 = 81\n\n|\n{z\n}\nCijkl = Cijlk\n6x6=36\n\nGeneralized Hooke's law III\nFinally, from thermodynamics, it can be shown that in an elastic material\nthe stresses are a state function of the strains, i.e. they derive from a\nthermodynamic potential (strain energy):\n∂ψ\nσij =\n= Cijkl εkl\n(1)\n∂εij\n∂2ψ\n∂\n=\nCijkl εkl\n(2)\n∂εmn∂εij\n∂εmn\n∂2ψ\nCijkl δkmδln =\n(3)\n∂εmn∂εij\n∂2ψ\nCijmn =\n(4)\n∂εmn∂εij\nAssuming equivalence of the mixed partials:\n∂2\n∂2\nψ\nψ\nCijkl =\n=\n= Cklij\n(5)\n∂εkl ∂εij\n∂εij ∂εkl\n\nGeneralized Hooke's law IV\nThis further reduces the number of material constants to 21. The most\ngeneral anisotropic linear elastic material therefore has 21 material\nconstants.

It is clear right from the start that we need precise\ndefinitions for these terms:\nDefinitions\nA quantity in the general sense is a property ascribed to phenomena, bodies, or\nsubstances that can be quantified for, or assigned to, a particular phenomenon,\nbody, or substance. Examples are mass and electric charge.\nA quantity in the particular sense is a quantifiable or assignable property\nascribed to a particular phenomenon, body, or substance. Examples are the mass\nof the moon and the electric charge of the proton.\nA physical quantity is a quantity that can be used in the mathematical equations\nof science and technology.\nA unit is a particular physical quantity, defined and adopted by convention, with\nwhich other particular quantities of the same kind are compared to express their\nvalue.\nA measurement is a direct or indirect comparison of a certain quantity with an\nappropriate standard or unit of measurement.\nThe value of a physical quantity is the quantitative expression of a particular\nphysical quantity as the product of a number and a unit, the number being its\nnumerical value. Thus, the numerical value of a particular physical quantity\ndepends on the unit in which it is expressed.\n\nIntroduction\nExample:\nThe value of the height hW of the Washington Monument is\nhW = 169 m = 555 ft. Here hW is the physical quantity, its value expressed in\nthe unit \"meter\", unit symbol m, is 169 m, and its numerical value when\nexpressed in meters is 169. However, the value of hW expressed in the unit\n\"foot\", symbol ft, is 555 ft, and its numerical value when expressed in feet is 555.\nhW\n=\nm =\nft\n|{z}\n|{z}\n|{z}\n|{z}\n|{z}\nvalue of the physical quantity\nnumerical value\nunit\nnumerical value\nunit\n|\n{z\n}\n|\n{z\n}\nvalue\nvalue\n\nFundamental and derived units\nWe said we need units to measure physical quantities. This process usually goes\nas follows:\n1 Single out (Identify) the class of phenomena of interest (mechanics,\nelectromagnetics, etc)\nList physical quantities involved.\nAdopt standard reference values for fundamental quantities. Realize that\nmathematical expressions relate these quantities, therefore they cannot all\nhave independent reference standards.\n4 Once fundamental units have been decided upon, derived units are\nobtained from the fundamental units using the mathematical definitions\nrelating the quantities involved.\nExample\nPhenomenon: Geometry of objects\nPhysical quantities: Length, Area, Volume\nFundamental units: meter (symbol m).\nDerived units:\nArea: meter squared (symbol m2)\nVolume: meter cubed (symbol m3)\n\nFundamental and derived units\nHere are some other examples to think about:\nExample\nPhenomenon: kinematics of\nbodies\nPhysical quantities: Distance,\nTime, Velocity, Acceleration\nFundamental units:\nDistance: meter (symbol m).\nTime: second (symbol s or\nsometimes sec).\nDerived units:\nVelocity: meter per second\n(symbol m.s-1 or m.sec-1)\nAcceleration: meter per second\nsquared (symbol m.s-2 or\nm.sec-2).\nExample\nPhenomenon: Dynamics of bodies\nPhysical quantities: all kinematics\n+ Mass, Force, Work,\nMomentum, ...\nFundamental units:\nDistance: meter (symbol m).\nTime: second (symbol s or\nsometimes sec).\nMass: kilogram (symbol kg).\nDerived units:\nForce: Newton (symbol\nN = kg.m.s-2)\nWork: Joule (symbol J = N.m)\n. . .\nWe observe that it is the class of phenomena under consideration, i.e., the\ncomplete set of physical quantities in which we are interested that ultimately\ndetermines if a given set of fundamental units is suycient for its measurement.\nFor example, it is not possible to define a unit of density from the fundamental\nunits of length and time. It is necessary to add the unit of mass.\n\nSystem of units:\nDefinition\nA set of fundamental units that is suycient for measuring the properties of the\nclass of phenomena under consideration is called a system of units.\nThe International System of Units\nThe International System of Units, universally abbreviated SI (from the French\nLe Systeme International d'Unites ), is the modern metric system of\nmeasurement. Long the dominant system used in science, the SI has rapidly\nbecome the dominant measurement system used in international commerce.\nThe definitive international reference on the SI is a booklet published by the\nInternational Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM, Bureau International des\nPoids et Mesures).\n\nThe SI system in the U.S.\nIn recognition of this fact and the increasing global nature of the marketplace,\nthe Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988, which changed the\nname of the National Bureau of Standards (NBS) to the National Institute of\nStandards and Technology (NIST) and gave to NIST the added task of helping\nU.S. industry increase its competitiveness, designate the metric system of\nmeasurement as the preferred system of weights and measures for United\nStates trade and commerce.\nThe oycial U.S. website with information on the SI is the Physics Laboratory of\nNIST.\nYou may download the authoritative publications for future reference directly\nfrom these links:\nNIST Special Publication 811.

The International System of Units (SI), 2019\nEdition\n\nSI base units\nThe SI is founded on seven SI base units for seven base quantities assumed to be\nmutually independent:\nSI base Units\nSI base unit\nBase quantity\nName\nSymbol\nlength\nmeter\nm\nmass\nkilogram\nkg\ntime\nsecond\ns\nelectric current\nampere\nA\nthermodynamic temperature\nkelvin\nK\namount of substance\nmole\nmol\nluminous intensity\ncandela\ncd\n\nSI base units\nDefinitions of the SI base units\nUnit of length\nmeter\nThe meter is the length of the path travelled by light in vacuum\nduring a time interval of 1/299, 792, 458 of a second.\nUnit of mass\nkilogram\nThe kilogram is the unit of mass; it is equal to the mass of the\ninternational prototype of the kilogram. In 2018, this was redefined\nbased on the Planck constant\nUnit of time\nsecond\nThe second is the duration of 9, 192, 631, 770 periods of the radiation\ncorresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of\nthe ground state of the cesium 133 atom.\nUnit of electric\ncurrent\nampere\nThe ampere is that constant current which, if maintained in two\nstraight parallel conductors of infinite length, of negligible circular\ncross-section, and placed 1 meter apart in vacuum, would produce\nbetween these conductors a force equal to 2 × 10-7 newton per\nmeter of length.\nUnit of ther\nmodynamic\nkelvin\nThe kelvin, unit of thermodynamic temperature, is the fraction\n1/273.16 of the thermodynamic temperature of the triple point of\nwater.\ntemperature\nUnit of amount\nof substance\nmole\n1. The mole is the amount of substance of a system which contains\nas many elementary entities as there are atoms in 0.012 kilogram of\ncarbon 12; its symbol is \"mol\".\n2. When the mole is used, the elementary entities must be specified\nand may be atoms, molecules, ions, electrons, other particles, or\nspecified groups of such particles.\nUnit of lumi\nnous intensity\ncandela\nThe candela is the luminous intensity, in a given direction, of a source\nthat emits monochromatic radiation of frequency 540 x 1012 hertz\nand that has a radiant intensity in that direction of 1/683 watt per\nsteradian.\n\nSI derived units I\nOther quantities, called derived quantities, are defined in terms of the seven\nbase quantities via a system of quantity equations. The SI derived units for\nthese derived quantities are obtained from these equations and the seven SI\nbase units.\nExamples of SI derived units\nSI derived unit\nDerived quantity\narea\nvolume\nName\nsquare meter\ncubic meter\nSymbol\nm\nm\nspeed, velocity\nacceleration\nmass density\nspecific volume\ncurrent density\nmeter per second\nmeter per second squared\nkilogram per cubic meter\ncubic meter per kilogram\nampere per square meter\n-1\nm.s\n-2\nm.s\n-3\nkg.m\nm .kg-1\n-2\nA.m\nFor ease of understanding and convenience, 22 SI derived units have been given\nspecial names and symbols:\n\nSI derived units II\n22 SI derived units with special names and symbols\nSI derived unit\nDerived quantity\nName\nSymbol Expression in terms\nExpression in terms\nof other SI units\nof SI base units\nplane angle\nradian\nrad\n-\nm · m-1 = 1\nsolid angle\nsteradian sr\n-\nm2 · m-2 = 1\nfrequency\nhertz\nHz\n-\ns-1\nforce\nnewton\nN\n-\nm · kg · s-2\npressure, stress\npascal\nPa\nN.m-2\nm-1 · kg · s-2\nenergy, work, quan-\njoule\nJ\nN · m\nm2 · kg · s-2\ntity of heat\nJ.s-1\npower, radiant flux\nwatt\nW\nm · kg · s-3\nelectric charge, quan-\ncoulomb\nC\n-\ns · A\ntity of electricity\n· A-1\nelectric potential dif-\nvolt\nV\nW.A-1\nm · kg · s-3\nference, electromo\ntive force\ncapacitance\nfarad\nF\nC.V-1\nm-2 · kg-1 · s4 · A2\nelectric resistance\nohm\nΩ\nV.A-1\nm2 · kg · s-3 · A\nelectric conductance\nsiemens\nS\nA.V-1\nm-2 · kg-1 · s · A2\n\nSI derived units III\n22 SI derived units with special names and symbols\nSI derived unit\nDerived quantity\nName\nSymbol Expression in terms\nExpression in terms\nof other SI units\nof SI base units\nmagnetic flux\nweber\nWb\nV · s\nm2 · kg · s-2 · A-1\nmagnetic flux density\ntesla\nT\nWb.m-2\nkg · s-2 · A-1\ninductance\nhenry\nH\nWb.A-1\nm2 · kg · s-2 · A-2\nCelsius temperature\ndegree\no C\n-\nK\nCelsius\nluminous flux\nlumen\nlm\ncd · sr\nm2 · m-2 · cd = cd\nilluminance\nlux\nlx\nlm.m-2\nm2·m-4·cd = m-2 ·\ncd\nactivity (of a radionu-\nbecquerel Bq\n-\ns-1\nclide)\nabsorbed\ndose,\ngray\nGy\nJ.kg-1\nm2 · s-2\nspecific\nenergy\n(imparted), kerma\ndose equivalent\nsievert\nSv\nJ.kg-1\nm · s-2\ncatalytic activity\nkatal\nkat\n-\ns-1 · mol\n\nSI base and derived units with special names and symbols\nSI base and\nderived units\n\nExplanation of diagram\nThe diagram above shows graphically how the 22 SI derived units with special\nnames and symbols are related to the seven SI base units.\nIn the first column the symbols of the SI base units are shown in rectangles, with\nthe name of the unit shown toward the upper left of the rectangle and the name\nof the associated base quantity shown in italic type below the rectangle.\nIn the third column the symbols of the derived units with special names are\nshown in solid circles, with the name of the unit shown toward the upper left of\nthe circle, the name of the associated derived quantity shown in italic type below\nthe circle, and an expression for the derived unit in terms of other units shown\ntoward the upper right in parenthesis.\nIn the second column are shown those derived units without special names [the\ncubic meter (m 3) excepted] that are used in the derivation of the derived units\nwith special names.

Examples are:\nthe minute (time), symbol: min, value in SI units: 1 min = 60 s\nthe hour (time), symbol: hr, value in SI units: 1 hr = 3600 s\nunits of angle: degree, minute, second\nthe liter\nthe electronvolt\nthe hectare\nthe Angstrom\netc\n\nDimensions of quantities I\nBy convention physical quantities are organized in a system of dimensions. Each\nof the seven base quantities used in the SI is regarded as having its own\ndimension, which is symbolically represented by a single sans serif roman capital\nletter. The symbols used for the base quantities, and the symbols used to denote\ntheir dimension, are given as follows\nBase quantities and dimensions used in the SI\nBase quantity\nSymbol for dimension\nlength\nL\nmass\nM\ntime\nT\nelectric current\nI\nthermodynamic temperature\nΘ\namount of substance\nN\nluminous intensity\nJ\n\nDimensions of quantities II\nAll other quantities are derived quantities, which may be written in terms of the\nbase quantities by the equations of physics. The dimensions of the derived\nquantities are written as products of powers of the dimensions of the base\nquantities using the equations that relate the derived quantities to the base\nquantities. In general the dimension of any quantity Q is written in the form of a\ndimensional product:\ndim(Q) = [Q] = LαMβ Tγ Iδ ΘεNξJη\nIn this sense, the dimension of the quantity Q, can be thought of as the relation\nthat describes the derived unit for this quantity in terms of the fundamental\nunits. It is customary (following a suggestion of Maxwell) to denote the\ndimension of a quantity Q by [Q].\nFor example, the dimension of density ρ is:\n[ρ] = ML-3\n\nClasses of systems of units\nDefinition\nTwo systems of units are said to be in the same class of systems of units if both\nsystems use standard quantities of the same physical nature as fundamental\nunits.\nExample\nFor mechanics phenomena, the SI uses length, mass and time as the standard\nquantities defining the fundamental units. We denote this class of system of\nunits as the LMT class. The fundamental SI units for the LMT class are the\nmeter, the Kilogram and the second (and sometimes referred to as the MKS\nsystem). Any system of units that uses the same standard quantities will be in\nthe same class. The CGS system is in the same class as the SI but the\nfundamental units are the centimeter, the gram and the second.\nDefinition\nDimensional and dimensionless quantities Quantities whose numerical values are\nidentical in all systems of units within a given class are called dimensionless. All\nother quantities are called dimensional.\n\nDimensional consistency\nDimensional consistency of equations The dimensions of each and every term\nin both sides of any equation with physical sense must be identical. Otherwise,\nan equality in one system would be broken upon conversion to another system.\nThis fact is used to obtain derived units from fundamental units.\nExample\nIn the LMT class, the dimension of mass is M, the dimension of acceleration is\nLT-2 , the dimension of force can be obtained (derived) from Newton's second\nlaw:\nF = m a\n[F ] = [m] [a] = MLT-2\nIn other words, in the LMT class, the dimension of force is LMT-2 .\nAn example of a relation that does not satisfy this requirement: The time t (in\nminutes) to drive to a point at a distance d (in miles) is equal to the number of\nmiles plus the number of trayc lights n (dimensionless). t = d + n\nAlthough this may be a good approximation with this specific choice of units, it\nwould clearly fail with any other choice of units. That is because the relation is\nnot dimensionally consistent. [t] = T 6= L + 1 = [d] + [n]\n\nDimensional Analysis\nWe can determine the unknown exponent p in the following equation by\nrequiring the same units on both sides:\np\nE\n=\nm cp\nML2T-2\n=\nM LT-1\n→\np\n=\nThis is one technique of Dimensional Analysis, which can allow us to identify the\ncontrolling physical quantities in unfamiliar or complicated quantities.\nFluid Dynamics, Solid Mechanics and Thermodynamics make extensive use of\nDimensional Analysis.\nWe will have an entire class dedicated to Dimensional Analysis in one of the\nUnified Lectures in the Spring.\n\nSome conversion factors between SI and English systems\ndimension\nSI unit\nEnglish Unit\nconversion\nLength\nTime\nm\ns\nft\nsec\n0.305 m/ft\n--\nMass\nForce\nPressure\nkg\nN\nPa\nslug\nlb\npsi\n14.6 Kg/slug\n4.45 N/lb\n6900 Pa/psi\nIn the SI system, mass (kg) is a fundamental unit, and force (N) is the derived\nunit, while in the English system, force (lb) is a fundamental unit, and mass\n(slug) is derived. This distinction is not too important in practice.\n\nFinal recommendations regarding Units and Dimensions\nBe VERY careful to give units with any numerical quantity.\nBe VERY careful not to mix units -- \"do not compare apples & oranges\"\nUse dimensions as a check on equation correctness.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu/\n16.001 Unified Engineering: Materials and Structures\nFall 2021\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: https://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

For a line segment dx of\nundeformed infinitesimal length\nkdxk = ΔS, and deformed length\nΔS0 = kdx0k, we define the normal\nstrain in the direction of the\nundeformed segment as:\ndx\nP\nQ\ndx′\nP′\nQ′\nP\nQ\nR\nπ\nP′\nQ′\nR′\nθ′\nΔS0 - ΔS\nε = lim\nΔS→0\nΔS\nEngineering shear strain: γ is the\nchange in angle between two\nperpedicular line segments in the\nundeformed configuration.\nπ\nγ =\n- θ0\nA note on units: strains both normal\nand shear are dimensionless quantities\n4/17\n\nDeformation and the Strain Tensor III\nStrain - displacement relations: Deformation described by displacement field\nu(x) = ui (x)ei .

For example, some parts of the body may elongate, others may\ncontract. This will also depend on the orientation. We wish to characterize the\nlocal state of deformation at each point of a material body. We therefore\ndescribe deformation by looking at the change of length of infinitesimal line\nsegments of arbitrary directions at a point.\ne1\ne2\ne3\ndx\nP\nQ\nx\ndx′\nP′\nQ′\nx′\nu\nDeformation described by deformation\nmapping:\nx0 = φ(x) = x + u\n(1)\nWe seek to characterize the local state\nof deformation of the material in a\nneighborhood of a point P.\n7/17\n\nDeformation and the Strain Tensor VI\nConsider two points P and Q in the undeformed:\nP : x = x1e1 + x2e2 + x3e3 = xi ei\n(2)\nQ : x + dx = (xi + dxi )ei\n(3)\nand deformed\nP0\n: x = φ1(x)e1 + φ2(x)e2 + φ3(x)e3 = φi (x)ei\n(4)\n\nQ0\n: x + dx0 = φi (x) + dφi ei\n(5)\nconfigurations.

The ropes\nare attached to a ball joint which is located at the origin O of the Cartesian coordinate\nsystem Oxyz. Two of these ropes are also attached to the ball joints A and B which are\nfixed to a rigid wall; the third one is connected to the ball joint C which is attached to\na rigid block of mass M. The latter stands on a plane surface; the coefficient of static\nfriction between it and the surface is μs.

It opposes the relative lateral\nmotion of the two surfaces which would occur in the absence of the friction due\nto applied external forces. The static friction force acts tangentially to the two\ncontacting surfaces. According to the Coulomb model, it fulfills the condition\n|F | ≤ μsN\nwhere μs is the coefficient of static friction corresponding to the considered pair\nof surfaces, and N is the acting normal force between the two surfaces.

There are many different\nvariants of the hardness test (Rockwell, Meyer, Knoop, Vickers, nanoindentation, etc.),\nbut in all these different variants, an indenter (often sharp with a self-similar shape) is\npressed into a specimen under a known load for a fixed time. The ratio of the load (F ,\nunits: N) to the projected area of the impression (A, units: m-2) gives the hardness (H,\nunits: N.m-2 or Pa) which is related to the yield strength (σy) by H ∼ 3σy. The origin\nof the proportionality constant of 3 is discussed on pg 105 of Ashby and Jones using a\nVERY elegant slip line argument.\nIn this problem, you are going perform a hardness test on a cheese (or any other food\nproduct) of your choice using a writing utensil (or any other sharp, nominally self-similar\nindenter).\n1. Describe your experimental setup and test specimen.\n2. Press the indenter into your specimen under a fixed load. You can use your hand\nto apply the load or some other object with known weight. For reference, an apple\nhas a weight of 1 N or you can compute the weight of a known volume of water.\nChoose the load such that the indentation depth remains in the tip portion of the\nwriting untensil and does not come too close to the cylindrical body. Apply the\nload for 3 s, measure the projected area of the indentation, and give the resulting\nhardness and strength in Pa.\n3. How does this compare with the strength of common engineering materials (e.g.,\naluminum alloys, steels, ceramics, polymers) from the property diagram shown in\nLecture 1?\n4. How does the hardness vary with position throughout your cheese/food?\n5. Repeat the hardness test but use different indentation times (1 s, 10 s, and 30 s).\nSummarize your measurements in a table. How does the hardness change with time?\nIs the cheese creeping (exhibiting time-dependent inelastic deformation)? Creep is\ncritically important in high-temperature aerospace applications, like propulsion sys\ntems and thermal protection systems.

In summary, we have that the\nforces in the rods are:\nFRS =\n√\n2P tensile\nFQR = P compressive\nFST = P tensile\nFQS = P compressive\nFQT =\n√\n2P tensile\nFPQ = 2P compressive\n(b) Assume now that we were only interested in the force in member PQ. What method\ncould you use to easily find the force in PQ (without knowledge of the internal forces\nPage 4\n\n16.001, M&S - Fall 2019\nHomework #3\nin the other members)? Perform the method and obtain this force.\nSolution: We could apply the method of sections in order to determine the\ninternal force in member PQ. Specifically, we may take a cut through members\nPQ, QT and ST, resulting in the following figure:\nS\nQ\nR\nT\nP\nFQT\nFPQ\nFST\nL\nL\nL\nTaking moments about the point T (not connected to the newly cut structure,\nbut shown for reference), we obtain the following equation\nX\nMT = 0 →(2L)(P) + (L)(FPQ) = 0\n(1)\nSolving for FPQ gives FPQ = -2P, which agrees with the value found in part\n(a).\n(c) What is the maximum load P the truss may support if the members can only handle\na maximum tension or compression of 20 kN?\nSolution: To solve this problem, we apply linearity and realize that the forces\nexperienced by individual members of the truss scale with the applied force P.\nThe maximum of these tensile/compressive forces is experienced by rod PQ\nwhich experiences a compressive force of 2P due to the applied load of P at\njoint R. Thus\n2P = 20 kN\nP = 10kN\nThus, the maximum allowable load P such that no member of the truss experi-\nences a force of more than 20 kN in magnitude is 10 kN .\nPage 5\n\n16.001, M&S - Fall 2019\nHomework #3\ni Problem M-3.2\nA space truss is a three-dimensional truss structure, an example of which is given in\nFigure 2.

Evaluate the following\nexpressions (where δij is the Kronecker delta and εijk is the permutation tensor):\n(a) δij δij\nSolution:\nwhere we have used the \"index replacing\" property of the kronecker delta.\nδij δij = δij δji = δii = δ11 + δ22 + δ33 =\n(b) εijkεkij (Hint: Expand this expression with all possible values for i, j, and k)\nSolution: Considering all possibilities of εijkεkij with distinct i, j, k\nεijkεkij = ε123ε312 + ε132ε213 + ε213ε321 + ε231ε123 + ε312ε231 + ε321ε132\n= (1)(1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (-1)(-1)\n= 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1\n= 6\n(c) δij εijk\nSolution: By the index replacing property of kronecker delta, replace either i\nor j in εijk with the other index so that\nδij εijk = εiik or εjjk = 0\n(1)\nsince εijk is nonzero only if i, j and k were distinct.\n(d) δij δikδjk\nSolution: Rearranging the δs and indices:\nδij δikδjk = δijδjkδki = δii = 3\n(2)\n(e) Finally, show that (a × b) · c = (b × c) · a = (c × a) · b\n(Hint: Represent these expressions in indicial notation, using what was derived for\nthe cross and dot products in class)\nPage 2\n\n16.001, M&S - Fall 2020\nHomework #5\nSolution: In indicial notation:\n(a × b) · c = εijkaj bk · c = εijkaj bkci\n(3)\n(b × c) · a = εijkbj ck · a = εijkaibj ck\n(4)\n(c × a) · b = εijkcj ak · b = εijkakbicj\n(5)\n(6)\nWe need to show that all of the expressions in indicial notation are equal to\neach other. We will show that the second and third expressions are equal to the\nfirst, and thereby all are equivalent.\n- εijkaibj ck (2nd expression) Making the swaps i → j, j → k, k → i\nεijkaibj ck = εjkiaj bkci\n(7)\nHowever, εjki = εijk since both expressions have the same permutation of\ni, j, k. Thus,\nεjkiaj bkci = εijkaj bkci\n(8)\nwhich is exactly the same as the first expression.\n- εijkakbicj (3rd expression) Now, making the swaps i → k, j → i, k → j\nεijkakbicj = εkij aj bkci\n(9)\nHowever, εkij = εijk since both expressions have the same permutation of\ni, j, k. Thus,\nεkij aj bkci = εijkaj bkci\n(10)\nwhich is exactly the same as the first expression. Thus, all three expres\nsions are equivalent, so we have shown that\n(a × b) · c = (b × c) · a = (c × a) · b\n(11)\nPage 3\n\n16.001, M&S - Fall 2020\nHomework #5\ni Problem M-5.2\nIn relation to the Cauchy tetrahedron discussed in class (shown in Figure 1 and found\nin the lecture notes), express in words in no more than a sentence or two what concepts\nthe following quantities represent:\n(a) t(n)\n= t(n)\n(b) tn\n· n\n(c) ts = t(n) - tnn\n(d) ts = |ts|\nSolution:\n(a) The quantity t(n) represents the stress vector acting on a plane with a unit\nnormal vector given by n.\n(b) The quantity tn is a scalar value indicating the component of the stress vector\nacting along the normal direction n. This represents the normal stress on the\nplane.\n(c) The quantity ts represents the projection of the stress vector t(n) onto the plane\nwith unit normal n.\n(d) The quantity ts is a scalar value indicating the magnitude of the stress vector\nacting in the direction of the plane with normal n. This represents the shear\nstress on the plane.\nFigure 1: Cauchy tetrahedron.\nPage 4\n\n16.001, M&S - Fall 2020\nHomework #5\ni Problem M-5.3\n(M.O. M8)\n√\n√\nIn the Cauchy tetrahedron, consider a plane with unit normal n = 1/ 3e1 + 1/ 3e2 +\n√\n1/ 3e3. In this plane, commonly known as an octahedral plane, the stress tensor σ has\nthe following representation\nσ =\n⎛ σ1\n⎝ 0\nσ2\n⎞\n⎠\nσ3\nwhere σ1, σ2 and σ3 are the principal stresses and n is the principal direction (we will\ncover principal stresses and directions and how to find them later on in the class). For\nthis octahedral plane, determine:\n(a) The magnitude of the normal stress on the plane.\n(b) The magnitude of the resultant shear stress on the plane.\nSolution:\n(a) We must obtain the stress vector t(n) on this plane and then the normal stress\ntn = t(n) · n. From the notes on Stress (slides 22-23) we have that t(n) = n · σ or\ntj (n) = σij ni. Therefore, the components of the stress vector on this plane are:\n(n)\n√\nt1\n= (σ11 + σ21 + σ31)n1 =\nσ1\n(n)\nt2\n= (σ12 + σ22 + σ32)n2 = √ σ2\n(n)\nt3\n= (σ13 + σ23 + σ33)n3 = √ σ3\nOverall t(n) = √1 (σ1e1 + σ2e2 + σ3e3). Now we can obtain tn = t(n) · n:\ntn = √ (σ1e1 + σ2e2 + σ3e3) · √ (e1 + e2 + e3) =\n(σ1 + σ2 + σ3)\n(b) The resultant shear stress is given by ts = |t(n) - tnn|.\nt(n) - tnn =\n\n√ (σ1e1 + σ2e2 + σ3e3) -\n(σ1 + σ2 + σ3) √ (e1 + e2 + e3)\n=\n√ (2σ1 - σ2 - σ3) e1 + √ (2σ2 - σ1 - σ3) e2 + √ (2σ3 - σ1 - σ2) e3\nPage 5\n\n16.001, M&S - Fall 2020\nHomework #5\nupon performing some algebra.

Since the orthotropic constitutive relations\nrelate stresses and strains in the composite material, one should be able to\ndetermine whether a fiber experiences a tensile or a compressive stress along its\ndirection based on strains. Derive a condition that the strain gauge readings εa\nand εb, and the shear strain ε12, should satisfy so that the stress along the fibers is\nnot compressive. Your condition should include material properties as well. Note:\nDon't use any of the numeric values for the elastic constants found in part (a), or\nassume the stress/strain components from the previous part. Solve symbolically in\nterms of εa, εb, ε12 and the material properties.\nSolution: Our goal is to ensure that the axial stress along the direction of the fibers σ 11\nis positive, and represent this in terms of strains.

We use\nthe following equations with a positive α since the rotation is counter-clockwise:\nPage 10\n\n16.001, M&S - Fall 2020\nHomework #9\nσ11 + σ22\nσ11 - σ22\nσ 11 =\n+\ncos(2α) + σ12sin(2α)\nσ11 + σ22\nσ11 - σ22\nσ 22 =\n-\ncos(2α) - σ12sin(2α)\nσ11 - σ22\nσ 12 = -\nsin(2α) + σ12cos(2α)\nThe numerical values of the stresses in the new basis aligned with the fibers is\nthe following:\nσ 11 = 0.067 σ0\nσ 22 = 0.93 σ0\nσ 12 = -0.25 σ0\nThen we apply the constitutive relations for orthotropic materials. The equa\ntions are the following:\nε 11 =\n( σ11 - ν12σ 22)\nE1\nε 22 =\n( σ22 - ν21σ 11)\nE2\nσ 12\n\n=\nε12\n2G\nWe recall that the reciprocity relation gives the following relation:\nν21\nν12\n=\nE2\nE1\nTherefore, we find the value ν21 = 0.136, and the numerical results for the\nstrains in the direction of the fibers are:\n\n= -1.43 × 10-12σ0\nε11\nε 22 = 1.31 × 10-11σ0\n\n= -1.39 × 10-12σ0\nε12\nFinally, the rotation back to the initial basis (e1, e2) with an angle -α gives the\nfollowing values for the strains:\n= -1.29 × 10-11σ0\nε11\n= -1.15 × 10-12σ0\nε22\n= -2.46 × 10-12σ0\nε12\nPage 11\n\n16.001, M&S - Fall 2020\nHomework #9\n3.2 (1 point) Interpret your results and explain how you think the material will\ndeform.\nSolution: We observe that the in the basis (e1, e2), there is some shear strain,\neven though there was no shear stress in the same basis. Since the strain is\nnegative, the material is likely to deform in a similar way as shown in Figure 2,\nthe blue color indicating the deformed configuration. This can also be explained\nphysically by the fact that E1 > E2, and therefore the material extends less in\nthe direction parallel to the fiber than in the direction perpendicular to the\nfibers.\nFigure 2: Composite Materials State of Stress\n3.3 (1 point) Find the principal directions of ε and σ. Do they coincide? Do they\nusually coincide in the case of orthotropic materials? What about isotropic\nmaterials?\nSolution: In the basis (e1, e2), there is no shear stress, so this is the principal\ndirection for σ (in other words, αp\nσ = 0). Concerning the strains, the principal\ndirection are found by rotating the basis (e1, e2) with an angle αp such that:\n2ε12\ntan(2αp) = ε11 - ε22\nαε = -9.62*\np\nSince ασ\np and αp\nε are not equal, the principal directions do not coincide. They do\nnot coincide in general in the case of orthotropic materials, so we should not be\nsurprised by the results. On the other hand, we saw in class that the principal\ndirections of ε and σ always coincide in the case of isotropic materials.\n3.4 (1 point) If the principal directions of ε and σ do not coincide in this\nconfiguration, can you find a value of α for which they would coincide? (all other\nparameters being equal)\nPage 12\n\n16.001, M&S - Fall 2020\nHomework #9\nSolution: We are looking for the angles α at which we get αp\nε = 0 (or at which\nε12 = 0). Using the same method as in the first part of the exercise without\nevaluating α at a particular value, we get:\nσ 11 = (1 + cos(2α))σ0\nσ 22 = (1 - cos(2α))σ0\nσ 12 = - sin(2α)σ0\nThen using the constitutive equations for isotropic materials, we get:\nσ0\n=\n(\n[(1 - ν12) + cos(2α)(1 + ν12)]\nε11\nσ11 - ν12σ 22) =\nE1\n2E1\nσ0\nε 22 =\n( σ22 - ν21σ 11) =\n[(1 - ν21) - cos(2α)(1 + ν21)]\nE2\n2E2\nσ 12\nσ0\nε 12 =\n= -\nsin(2α)\n2G\n2G\nFinally, the last step is to rotate back the strain to the initial basis. We are\nonly interested in the shear strain. Indeed, we are looking for the angles α at\nwhich ε12 vanish. The formula for the shear strain is:\nε 11 - ε 22\nε12(α) = -\nsin(-2α) + ε12cos(-2α)\nPluging the values of ε11, ε 22, and ε12 yield to a complex equation that one can\nnot solve analytically. Using an external software (Mathematica, Matlab,etc),\nwe can find the values of α which cancel ε12(α). By looking at the interval\n[-90*; 90*], we find 5 values of α that fulfill this condition:\nα = ±90*\nα = ±23.11*\nα = 0\nPage 13\n\n⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n16.001, M&S - Fall 2020\nHomework #9\ni Problems M-9.4\n[0 points]\nConsider the following orthotropic costitutive law for wood\n⎞\n⎛\n⎫\n⎧\n⎫\n⎧\n-ν21\n-ν31\nE2\nE3\nε11\nσ11\nE1\n⎜\n⎜\n⎜\n⎜\n⎜\n⎜\n⎜\n⎝\n⎟\n⎟\n⎟\n⎟\n⎟\n⎟\n⎟\n⎠\n-ν12\n-ν32\nE1\nE3\nε22\nσ22\n⎪\n⎨\n⎪\n⎬\n⎪\n⎨\n⎪\n⎬\nE2\n-ν13\n-ν23\nE1\nE2\nε33\n2ε23\nσ33\nσ23\nE3\n=\nG23\nG13\n2ε31\nσ31\n⎪\n⎩\n⎪\n⎭\n⎪\n⎩\n⎪\n⎭\nG12\n2ε12\nσ12\n4.1 (1 point) The wood is in pure compression in the σ11 direction and it is in purely\ncompressive strain in this direction as well. What can we conclude from this re\ngarding the parameters in the constitutive law?\nSolution: The equations imply directly the following results\nν12\n2ε22 = -\nσ11 = 0\nE1\nν13\n2ε33 = -\nσ11 = 0\nE1\nThese imply that ν21, ν31, ν12 and ν13 are zero. They do not imply that all the\npoisson ratios are zero.\n4.2 (1 point) Now consider the wood as being a part of the side of a tree. The e1\ndirection points up away from the ground and the e2 direction points radially into\nthe tree. Assume that all the poisson ratios are not equal to zero and are strictly\npositive. Further assume that none of the three young's moduli are equal so that\nthis is an orthotropic material. If you had the ability to select the three youngs\nmoduli of the wood on the outside of this tree, which would you make largest and\nsmallest in order to allow the tree trunk to hold the largest vertical loads with\nminimal straining? It might help to consider that the material on the outside of\nthe tree needs to contain all the material inside the core just like a pressure vessel\ncontains a gas.\nSolution: In order to make the tree strongest with respect to loadings σ11, E1\nshould be chosen as the largest youngs modulus. This will prevent the tree from\ncompressing vertically under vertical loading. Because the poisson's ratio's are\nall selected to be positive this compressive stress will produce components of\npositive strain in the ε22 and ε33 components. We can imagine that at the center\nof this tree where the idea of a radial direction is not well defined that the wood\nin the center of the horizontal plane of the trunk would be in a state of uniform\nand positive strain in both directions. In order to contain the pressure induced\nby the poisson effect and the vertical loading, a large youngs modulus in the\nPage 14\n\n16.001, M&S - Fall 2020\nHomework #9\nhoop direction that is not the radial direction is prefered. The smallest youngs\nmodulus would be in the radial direction. Many woods have these material\nproperties.\n4.3 (1 point) If you cut down this tree you can measure the youngs modulus E1 by\nplacing the wood in pure tension oriented along the vertical direction. You put the\nmaterial under 10 MPa of stress along the grain and observe 800 microstrain along\nthe grain. None of the other strain gages read any strain so you conclude that your\ntest was in the principle axis of the material. Find the largest youngs modulus of\nthe wood.\nSolution: The youngs modulus is simply the stress divided by the strain which\nyields a modulus of 12.5 GPa.\n4.4 (1 point) Your test to find the other two youngs moduli does not go as smoothly.\nYou take a piece of material that is thin in the e1 direction and you place it under\n10 MPa of uniaxial tension in some x direction. The tree is not a perfect circle\nand you have trouble orienting your loading in the direction that is the radial\ndirection. Consequently, your strain gages find that the material strained 1000\nmicrostrain in the x direction and -800 microstrain in the other y direction. It also\nstrained 50 microstrain in the direction 45 degrees off from the x axis and the y\naxis. Compute the principal strains in your test and the angle of rotation needed\nto attain a frame of principle strain. Are the principle stresses and strains in the\nsame frame? Comment on if you can find the other two moduli.\nSolution: Using the shear strain transformation equation we can compute the\nangle of rotation needed to get this state of strain into the state of principle\nstrain\n1000 - (-800)\n0 = -\nsin(2θ) + 50 cos(2θ)\n900 = tan(2θ)\nθ = 1.5899\nFrom this we can find that the principle strains are 1000.97 and -800.97 micros-\ntrain so we are very close to a state of principle strain. The frame of principle\nstress and strain do not need to line up if the constitive law is not isotropic. In\nthis case, the wood has a prefered direction that it likes to deform in, and if\nyou accidentally stress the wood at some slight angle to this direction then the\nwood will strain slightly more in the components that areclose to the direction\nin which it is less stiff.\nThe state of stress in this axis is three values as is the state of strain. So this test\ngives us 3 pieces of information regarding our constitutive law. For orthotropic\nPage 15\n\n16.001, M&S - Fall 2020\nHomework #9\n2D materials we have 5 parameters and one constraint from the poisson ratio\nterms being equal. This is four independent unknowns plus the unknown angle\nof the principle axis of the material. So we need to get two more independent\npieces of information about this material to really understand its constitutive\nlaw.\n4.5 (1 point) Another student takes a sample of identical material and cuts it at some\nstrange angle and proceeds with a much more complicated calculation of the kind\nthat you just did. They compute that the youngs moduli in the plane of the wood\nthat they have cut are 9 and 15 GPa. Is this possible given your results?\nSolution: No they cannot find a youngs modulus larger then the largest prin\nciple moduli by cutting in a different plane. The principle axis are the stifffest\nand least stiff directions in the material, so there is no stiffer direction.\n4.6 (1 point) You now take your sample and perform a different uniaxial tension test in\nthe y direction again using 10 MPa.

Compare your estimate with the information available online.\nSolution: From the charts for the JFK to Abu Dhabi flight and the information\non the Airbus web site, we can obtain or estimate the following parameters:\nL = 380t,\nD = 23t,\nηoverall = 0.35,\nhf = 42M J/kg,\nMTOW = 380t,\nWfuel = 180.5t,\ng = 9.81m/s2,\nwp = 90kg,\nnp = 270\nWfuel was obtained from the listed maximum fuel capacity of 222.85m3 and the\nmass density of jet fuel which is ρfuel = 810kg.m-3.\nReplacing these in the\nRange Equation we obtain:\nRmax = 16414 Kilometers\nwhich is pretty close to the listed range of 16670 Kilometers.\n(b) Imagine that the aerodynamic design can be improved such that L/D increases by\n3%.

If those forces are not possible, then the\nsystem is not in equilibrium and is therefore unstable. We begin the problem\nby stating equilibrium of forces on all balls in the system. Starting with ball B:\nx\ny\nB\nWb\nRB\nFBC\nX\nFx\n: FBC ∗cos φ -RB = 0\n(24)\nX\nFy\n: FBC ∗sin φ -Wb = 0\n(25)\nPage 11\n\n16.001, M&S - Fall 2020\nHomework #1\nThen, the equilibrium of forces on ball C gives:\nx\ny\nC\nWb\nRC\nFBC\nRG\nX\nFx\n: RC -FBC ∗cos φ = 0\n(26)\nX\nFy\n: RG -FBC ∗sin φ -Wb = 0\n(27)\nNote that we used Newton's third law to equal the forces of B on C and of C\non B. We have four equations and four unknowns RB, RC, RG, and FBC, and\nwe can therefore solve the problem. The values of cos(φ) and sin(φ) can be\nevaluated with the geometry:\ncos φ = Dc -Db\nDb\n(28)\nsin φ =\np\n1 -cos φ2\n(29)\nThe algebraic computation produces the following results which for convenience\nare stated in terms of the variable (φ):\nRG = 2Wb\n(30)\nRB =\nWb\ntan φ\n(31)\nRC =\nWb\ntan φ\n(32)\nFCB = FBC = Wb\nsin φ\n(33)\nNow we can look at the equilibrium of forces on the can. Along the horizontal\naxis, we have:\nX\nFx\n: RB -RC = 0\n(34)\nPage 12\n\n16.001, M&S - Fall 2020\nHomework #1\nThe equilibrium of forces in the horizontal direction is satisfied based on the\nvalues of RB and RC obtained previously.

We therefore describe this\nring of normal forces per unit length as being represented by an effective force\non the left most point and an effective force on the right most point.

In\nfact, this expression is entirely independent of Wb′ therefore it does not matter\nhow heavy our third ball is! No ball of diameter 45 mm can stabilize this system\nno matter its weight!\n(c) Can any changes to this third ball's weight or radius be made to stabilize this\nsystem?\nSolution: To understand the impact of balls of various sizes and weights we\nwill simplify the general expression for the moments on the can by substituting\nin the definitions of cos θ and cos φ.\nPage 18\n\n16.001, M&S - Fall 2020\nHomework #1\nX\nMz\n= (FRightRim -FLeftRim) ∗Dc\n2 + (Wb′) ∗(Db + Db′\n∗(Dc -Db′+Db\nDb′+Db\n))-\n(71)\n(Wb′ + Wb) ∗Db ∗(Dc -Db\nDb\n) = 0\n(72)\nX\nMz\n= (FRightRim -FLeftRim) ∗Dc\n2 + (Wb′) ∗(Dc -Db′ + Db\n)\n(73)\n-(Wb′ + Wb) ∗(Dc -Db) = 0\n(74)\nX\nMz\n= (FRightRim-FLeftRim)∗Dc\n2 +(Wb′)∗(Db -Db′\n)-(Wb)∗(Dc-Db) = 0 (75)\nThe middle term is the term containing the parameters of the third ball. It\nvanishes when the diameters are equal, but can provide a positive moment to\nthe system if Db′ < Db. This moment is proportional to the weight of the new\nball due to dimensional scaling laws. From part A we find that an additional\n.015 Nm of torque was required to hold the system in equilibrium. Therefore\nthe constraint that the third ball must meet is the following.\nWb′ ∗(Db -Db′\n) > 0.015\n(76)\nWb′ ∗(0.045 -Db′\n) > 0.015\n(77)\nAny suggested ball that meets this constraint would work to stabilize the system,\nbut there is an additional condition that Db′ > 0.025 in order for the third ball\nto avoid sliding past ball B and make contact with ball C. Should this occur our\nanalysis of the contact problem would be incorrect as the contact points and\ngeometry would be different.\nAdditionally, it should be noted that with this smaller ball diameter it is possible\nfor the small third ball to become lodged on the right hand side of the can. Such\na situation would not help to stabilize the can as the new ball would effectively\nbe increasing the weight of ball B and consequently the force at reaction B.\nThe new ball would also be providing an addition to the moment arm for the\nhorizontal forces on the right side of the can which convey destabilizing, negative\nmoments. It is interesting to note that the larger ball will always destabilize,\nPage 19\n\n16.001, M&S - Fall 2020\nHomework #1\nand a smaller ball can provide either effect depending on how it settles. Lastly,\nwe should also note that if the mass of this new third ball becomes sufficiently\nlarge and the new diameter is sufficiently smaller then the diameter of the balls\nbelow it, the new positive moment term could potentially rotate the can around\nthe left rim and cause instability in the other direction.\nPage 20\n\n16.001, M&S - Fall 2020\nHomework #1\ni Problem M-1.4\nA small box of mass m hangs from three massless ropes as shown in Figure 7. The ropes\nare attached to a ball joint which is located at the origin O of the Cartesian coordinate\nsystem Oxyz. Two of these ropes are also attached to the ball joints A and B which are\nfixed to a rigid wall; the third one is connected to the ball joint C which is attached to\na rigid block of mass M. The latter stands on a plane surface; the coefficient of static\nfriction between it and the surface is μs. Note that the gravity g acts on the small box\nand the block which are both made from a homogeneous material.\nHint:\n- Static friction is the force F that acts between two solid surfaces which are in\ncontact but do not move relative to each other.\nIt opposes the relative lateral\nmotion of the two surfaces which would occur in the absence of the friction due\nto applied external forces. The static friction force acts tangentially to the two\ncontacting surfaces. According to the Coulomb model, it fulfills the condition\n|F| ≤μsN\nwhere μs is the coefficient of static friction corresponding to the considered pair\nof surfaces, and N is the acting normal force between the two surfaces. (If the\ncondition was violated, the surfaces would start moving relative to each other.)\nm\nM\n2 1\ny\nz\nx\ng\nbc\nO\nbc B\nbc\nA\nbcC\nFigure 7: Box hanging from three ropes.\nPage 21\n(c) Tata McGraw-Hill Education Private Limited.

What is the maximum value for the mass m\nof the small box so that this safety condition is met?\nSolution: Ropes can support only axial tensile forces. Express these forces as\nvectors in terms of the sought force magnitudes and unit direction vectors:\nForce in Rope OA:\nF OA = FOA ˆvOA\nwhere\nˆvOA = 1\n\n-2\n-1\n\n(78)\nForce in Rope OB:\nF OB = FOB ˆvOB\nwhere\nˆvOB = 1\n\n-2\n\n(79)\nForce in Rope OC:\nF OC = FOC ˆvOC\nwhere\nˆvOC = 1\n\n(80)\nConsider the force equilibrium for the ball joint at Point O:\nx\ny\nz\nF OA\nF OB\nF OC\nmg\nbc\nO\nX\nF = 0 :\nF OA + F OB + F OC + mg = 0\n(81)\nwhere\ng = g\n\n-1\n\n(82)\nInserting Eqs.

(81) and solving for FOA, FOB, FOC yields:\nFOA = FOB = 9\n28 mg\n(83)\nFOC = 5\n7 mg\n(84)\nThe largest force occurs in Rope OC which connects the small box to the block.\nSetting FOC = Fmax then yields the maximum value for the mass m that the\nsmall box can have while the force Fmax is not exceeded in any rope:\nFOC = Fmax\n⇒\nmmax = 7\nFmax\ng\n(85)\n(b) If the mass m of the small box was chosen too large, the block of mass M might\ntilt over. Assuming that the coefficient of static friction between the block and\nthe surface is large enough to prevent sliding, what is the maximum value for the\nPage 22\n\n16.001, M&S - Fall 2020\nHomework #1\nmass m of the box at which no tilting of the block occurs?\nSolution: In order to approach this part, consider the static equilibrium for the\nblock using the x- and z-components of the force vector F OC (i.e. FOC,x = 3\n7 mg\nand FOC,z = 4\n7 mg) from the previous part.\nBoth a resultant normal force N (resulting from distributed normal forces ex-\nerted from the ground on the block) and a resultant friction force F must be\nincluded to represent the ground. Note that the point of attack of these forces\nis not necessarily below the center of mass (CM) due to the force exerted by\nRope OC but at an a priori unknown position xN:\nFOC,z\nFOC,x\nMg\nF\nN\nxN\nx\nz\nb CM\nb D\nX\nFx = 0 :\n-FOC,x + F = 0\n(86)\nX\nFz = 0 :\n-FOC,z -Mg + N = 0\n(87)\nX\nM (D) = 0 :\n(counterclockwisely)\nFOC,x · 4 -Mg · 1 + N · xN = 0\n(88)\nPage 23\n\n16.001, M&S - Fall 2020\nHomework #1\nThe equilibrium conditions yield the unknown reaction forces N and F as well\nas the unknown distance xN:\nF = 3\n7 mg\n(89)\nN = Mg + 4\n7 mg\n(90)\nxN = 1 -12\nm\nM\n1 + 4\nm\nM\n(91)\nThe block does not tilt if xN > 0. In that case, the moment about D resulting\nfrom both the force in Rope OC and the weight is positive in the clockwise\ndirection. If xN = 0, this moment would become zero, and the block would start\ntilting as soon as FOC was increased slightly more. Therefore, the maximum\nmass m of the small box for which no tilting of the block occurs is\nxN = 0\n⇒\nm = 7\n12 M.\n(92)\n(c) For which value of the coefficient of static friction μs would the block start sliding\n(assuming that no tilting has occurred yet)? Using the result from the previous\npart, how should the value of the coefficient of static friction μs be chosen so that\nsliding and tilting would occur for the same value of the mass m?\nSolution:\nFollowing the hint given in the problem statement, the condition for no slipping\nof the block is\n|F| ≤μsN,\n(93)\nmeaning that slipping would start once\n|F| = μsN\n(94)\nhas been reached. Using the values for F and N obtained in the previous part,\nEq. (94) yields the minimum coefficient of static friction required to prevent\nslipping of the block,\nμs =\n4 + 7M\nm\n.\n(95)\nIf the onset of tilting and slipping of the block is supposed to occur for the same\nvalue of m, the result (92) from the previous part needs to be used in Eq.

There are many different\nvariants of the hardness test (Rockwell, Meyer, Knoop, Vickers, nanoindentation, etc.),\nbut in all these different variants, an indenter (often sharp with a self-similar shape) is\npressed into a specimen under a known load for a fixed time. The ratio of the load (F ,\nunits: N) to the projected area of the impression (A, units: m-2) gives the hardness (H,\nunits: N.m-2 or Pa) which is related to the yield strength (σy) by H ∼ 3σy. The origin\nof the proportionality constant of 3 is discussed on pg 105 of Ashby and Jones using a\nVERY elegant slip line argument.\nIn this problem, you are going perform a hardness test on a cheese (or any other food\nproduct) of your choice using a writing utensil (or any other sharp, nominally self-similar\nindenter).\n1. Describe your experimental setup and test specimen.\n2. Press the indenter into your specimen under a fixed load. You can use your hand\nto apply the load or some other object with known weight. For reference, an apple\nhas a weight of 1 N or you can compute the weight of a known volume of water.\nChoose the load such that the indentation depth remains in the tip portion of the\nwriting untensil and does not come too close to the cylindrical body. Apply the\nload for 3 s, measure the projected area of the indentation, and give the resulting\nhardness and strength in Pa.\n3. How does this compare with the strength of common engineering materials (e.g.,\naluminum alloys, steels, ceramics, polymers) from the property diagram shown in\nLecture 1?\n4. How does the hardness vary with position throughout your cheese/food?\n5. Repeat the hardness test but use different indentation times (1 s, 10 s, and 30 s).\nSummarize your measurements in a table. How does the hardness change with time?\nIs the cheese creeping (exhibiting time-dependent inelastic deformation)? Creep is\ncritically important in high-temperature aerospace applications, like propulsion sys\ntems and thermal protection systems.

In this plane, commonly known as an octahedral plane, the stress tensor σ has\nthe following representation\nσ =\n\nσ1\nσ2\nσ3\n\nwhere σ1, σ2 and σ3 are the principal stresses and n is the principal direction (we will\ncover principal stresses and directions and how to find them later on in the class). For\nthis octahedral plane, determine:\n(a) The magnitude of the normal stress on the plane.\n(b) The magnitude of the resultant shear stress on the plane.\nSolution:\n(a) We must obtain the stress vector t(n) on this plane and then the normal stress\ntn = t(n) ·n. From the notes on Stress (slides 22-23) we have that t(n) = n·σ or\ntj(n) = σijni.

Form this write the equation of equilibrium.\nX\nF2 = 2PrL -2σhoopLt = 0\nwhere L is the length of the vessel and t is the thickness. From this we obtain\nσhoop = pr\nt = 45(1.25)\n0.020\n= 2812.5 MPa\nNext, find σlong. Take a cut and draw a FBD (See Figure 6) and the write the equation of\nequilibirum.\nX\nF1 = Pπr2 -σlong2πrt = 0\nFrom this we obtain\nσlong = pr\n2t = 45(1.25)\n2(0.020) = 1406.25 MPa\nNow the stress state along the weld needs to be calculated.

These grid fins will be significantly larger than the ones on the Falcon\n9 (7x3 m2 vs. 2x1.2 m2), making cost a much bigger concern. The grid fins should be\nlight, cheap, and capable of surviving multiple exposures to high temperatures (>400\n*C). They also need to be stiff so that they don't deflect during reentry.\nIn each of the following materials selection problems, list the function, objective(s),\nconstraints, and materials indices with which ranked the different materials. You can\nuse this reference to determine the appropriate materials index. Show the Property\nDiagram(s) that you used to make your decisions with the appropriate materials index\ncontour overlaid. Indicate on the property diagram the best 2 or 3 materials options\nusing the labeling function.\nSolution: Function: Grid fins on F9 booster\nObjective(s): Minimize cost and mass\nConstraints: - Must have a maximum service temperatures greater than 500 °C - Should be\nstiff to minimize elastic deflection - Easy to process into bulk forms\nNotes + materials indices: We are trying to minimize two objectives in this problem - cost\nand mass. These objectives often conflict, since stiff, low-density materials also tend to be\nexpensive. Ashby gives a thorough discussion of how to handle such multi-objective materials\nselection problems in this excellent manuscript. The constraint on processability immediately\nsuggests focusing on metals, which tend to be easy to form into large shapes. As discussed in\nrecitation, grid fins can be approximated as panels. The relevant material indices are therefore\nE1/3/ρ and E1/3/(ρCm). Consider the property diagrams E vs. ρ, E vs. ρCm, and E1/3/ρ vs\nE1/3/(ρCm) shown below. The relevant material indices have been overlaid on the E vs. ρ and\nE the vs. ρCm diagrams. Beryllium and titanium alloys are attractive candidates on a mass\nbasis if cost is not an issue. Steels become the obvious choice if cost is a concern (Note: cast\niron, a high carbon ferrous alloy, is way too brittle for this application, while stainless steels\noffer a good combination of ductility, high temperature strength, and oxidation resistance). The\nproperty diagram E1/3/ρ vs E1/3/(ρCm) shows the envelope of material indices for all metals,\nhighlighting the tradeoff between cost and mass. Low alloy steels and stainless steels seem like\nthey have a good balance of high stiffness, low cost, and low density. You will have to dig deeper\ninto the documentation before making a final selection. If temperature wasn't a constraint, then\nmagnesium alloys would be attractive grid fin materials. However, magnesium tends to burn\naggressively in high temperature oxidizing environments which is why it is used in fireworks.\nPage 2\n\n16.001, M&S - Fall 2020\nHomework #8\nPage 3\n\n16.001, M&S - Fall 2020\nHomework #8\nPage 4\n\n16.001, M&S - Fall 2020\nHomework #8\nPage 5\n\n16.001, M&S - Fall 2020\nHomework #8\ni Problems M-8.2\n[5 points]\nThe extensional and shear strains at a point of a loaded structure have been measured\nwith respect to a particular set of cartesian basis vectors.

Do you have insufficient or redundant information? How can this be useful\nfrom the experimental standpoint?\nSolution: The system is clearly overdetermined as it has three unknowns and four equa\ntions. This overdetermination provides some means of reducing the uncertainty of the\nexperimental measurements: instead of finding the exact solution to the system which\nmost likely won't exist unless the four values are mutually consistent, one can try to find\nthe best approximation to the quantities of interest from the given data.\nIt makes a lot of sense to have more measurements than the minimum required.

Since the orthotropic constitutive relations\nrelate stresses and strains in the composite material, one should be able to\ndetermine whether a fiber experiences a tensile or a compressive stress along its\ndirection based on strains. Derive a condition that the strain gauge readings εa\nand εb, and the shear strain ε12, should satisfy so that the stress along the fibers is\nnot compressive. Your condition should include material properties as well. Note:\nDon't use any of the numeric values for the elastic constants found in part (a), or\nassume the stress/strain components from the previous part. Solve symbolically in\nterms of εa, εb, ε12 and the material properties.\nSolution: Our goal is to ensure that the axial stress along the direction of the fibers σ 11\nis positive, and represent this in terms of strains.

We use\nthe following equations with a positive α since the rotation is counter-clockwise:\nPage 10\n\n16.001, M&S - Fall 2020\nHomework #9\nσ11 + σ22\nσ11 - σ22\nσ 11 =\n+\ncos(2α) + σ12sin(2α)\nσ11 + σ22\nσ11 - σ22\nσ 22 =\n-\ncos(2α) - σ12sin(2α)\nσ11 - σ22\nσ 12 = -\nsin(2α) + σ12cos(2α)\nThe numerical values of the stresses in the new basis aligned with the fibers is\nthe following:\nσ 11 = 0.067 σ0\nσ 22 = 0.93 σ0\nσ 12 = -0.25 σ0\nThen we apply the constitutive relations for orthotropic materials. The equa\ntions are the following:\nε 11 =\n( σ11 - ν12σ 22)\nE1\nε 22 =\n( σ22 - ν21σ 11)\nE2\nσ 12\n\n=\nε12\n2G\nWe recall that the reciprocity relation gives the following relation:\nν21\nν12\n=\nE2\nE1\nTherefore, we find the value ν21 = 0.136, and the numerical results for the\nstrains in the direction of the fibers are:\n\n= -1.43 × 10-12σ0\nε11\nε 22 = 1.31 × 10-11σ0\n\n= -1.39 × 10-12σ0\nε12\nFinally, the rotation back to the initial basis (e1, e2) with an angle -α gives the\nfollowing values for the strains:\n= -1.29 × 10-11σ0\nε11\n= -1.15 × 10-12σ0\nε22\n= -2.46 × 10-12σ0\nε12\nPage 11\n\n16.001, M&S - Fall 2020\nHomework #9\n3.2 (1 point) Interpret your results and explain how you think the material will\ndeform.\nSolution: We observe that the in the basis (e1, e2), there is some shear strain,\neven though there was no shear stress in the same basis. Since the strain is\nnegative, the material is likely to deform in a similar way as shown in Figure 2,\nthe blue color indicating the deformed configuration. This can also be explained\nphysically by the fact that E1 > E2, and therefore the material extends less in\nthe direction parallel to the fiber than in the direction perpendicular to the\nfibers.\nFigure 2: Composite Materials State of Stress\n3.3 (1 point) Find the principal directions of ε and σ. Do they coincide? Do they\nusually coincide in the case of orthotropic materials? What about isotropic\nmaterials?\nSolution: In the basis (e1, e2), there is no shear stress, so this is the principal\ndirection for σ (in other words, αp\nσ = 0). Concerning the strains, the principal\ndirection are found by rotating the basis (e1, e2) with an angle αp such that:\n2ε12\ntan(2αp) = ε11 - ε22\nαε = -9.62*\np\nSince ασ\np and αp\nε are not equal, the principal directions do not coincide. They do\nnot coincide in general in the case of orthotropic materials, so we should not be\nsurprised by the results. On the other hand, we saw in class that the principal\ndirections of ε and σ always coincide in the case of isotropic materials.\n3.4 (1 point) If the principal directions of ε and σ do not coincide in this\nconfiguration, can you find a value of α for which they would coincide? (all other\nparameters being equal)\nPage 12\n\n16.001, M&S - Fall 2020\nHomework #9\nSolution: We are looking for the angles α at which we get αp\nε = 0 (or at which\nε12 = 0). Using the same method as in the first part of the exercise without\nevaluating α at a particular value, we get:\nσ 11 = (1 + cos(2α))σ0\nσ 22 = (1 - cos(2α))σ0\nσ 12 = - sin(2α)σ0\nThen using the constitutive equations for isotropic materials, we get:\nσ0\n=\n(\n[(1 - ν12) + cos(2α)(1 + ν12)]\nε11\nσ11 - ν12σ 22) =\nE1\n2E1\nσ0\nε 22 =\n( σ22 - ν21σ 11) =\n[(1 - ν21) - cos(2α)(1 + ν21)]\nE2\n2E2\nσ 12\nσ0\nε 12 =\n= -\nsin(2α)\n2G\n2G\nFinally, the last step is to rotate back the strain to the initial basis. We are\nonly interested in the shear strain. Indeed, we are looking for the angles α at\nwhich ε12 vanish. The formula for the shear strain is:\nε 11 - ε 22\nε12(α) = -\nsin(-2α) + ε12cos(-2α)\nPluging the values of ε11, ε 22, and ε12 yield to a complex equation that one can\nnot solve analytically. Using an external software (Mathematica, Matlab,etc),\nwe can find the values of α which cancel ε12(α). By looking at the interval\n[-90*; 90*], we find 5 values of α that fulfill this condition:\nα = ±90*\nα = ±23.11*\nα = 0\nPage 13\n\n⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n16.001, M&S - Fall 2020\nHomework #9\ni Problems M-9.4\n[0 points]\nConsider the following orthotropic costitutive law for wood\n⎞\n⎛\n⎫\n⎧\n⎫\n⎧\n-ν21\n-ν31\nE2\nE3\nε11\nσ11\nE1\n⎜\n⎜\n⎜\n⎜\n⎜\n⎜\n⎜\n⎝\n⎟\n⎟\n⎟\n⎟\n⎟\n⎟\n⎟\n⎠\n-ν12\n-ν32\nE1\nE3\nε22\nσ22\n⎪\n⎨\n⎪\n⎬\n⎪\n⎨\n⎪\n⎬\nE2\n-ν13\n-ν23\nE1\nE2\nε33\n2ε23\nσ33\nσ23\nE3\n=\nG23\nG13\n2ε31\nσ31\n⎪\n⎩\n⎪\n⎭\n⎪\n⎩\n⎪\n⎭\nG12\n2ε12\nσ12\n4.1 (1 point) The wood is in pure compression in the σ11 direction and it is in purely\ncompressive strain in this direction as well. What can we conclude from this re\ngarding the parameters in the constitutive law?\nSolution: The equations imply directly the following results\nν12\n2ε22 = -\nσ11 = 0\nE1\nν13\n2ε33 = -\nσ11 = 0\nE1\nThese imply that ν21, ν31, ν12 and ν13 are zero. They do not imply that all the\npoisson ratios are zero.\n4.2 (1 point) Now consider the wood as being a part of the side of a tree. The e1\ndirection points up away from the ground and the e2 direction points radially into\nthe tree. Assume that all the poisson ratios are not equal to zero and are strictly\npositive. Further assume that none of the three young's moduli are equal so that\nthis is an orthotropic material. If you had the ability to select the three youngs\nmoduli of the wood on the outside of this tree, which would you make largest and\nsmallest in order to allow the tree trunk to hold the largest vertical loads with\nminimal straining? It might help to consider that the material on the outside of\nthe tree needs to contain all the material inside the core just like a pressure vessel\ncontains a gas.\nSolution: In order to make the tree strongest with respect to loadings σ11, E1\nshould be chosen as the largest youngs modulus. This will prevent the tree from\ncompressing vertically under vertical loading. Because the poisson's ratio's are\nall selected to be positive this compressive stress will produce components of\npositive strain in the ε22 and ε33 components. We can imagine that at the center\nof this tree where the idea of a radial direction is not well defined that the wood\nin the center of the horizontal plane of the trunk would be in a state of uniform\nand positive strain in both directions. In order to contain the pressure induced\nby the poisson effect and the vertical loading, a large youngs modulus in the\nPage 14\n\n16.001, M&S - Fall 2020\nHomework #9\nhoop direction that is not the radial direction is prefered. The smallest youngs\nmodulus would be in the radial direction. Many woods have these material\nproperties.\n4.3 (1 point) If you cut down this tree you can measure the youngs modulus E1 by\nplacing the wood in pure tension oriented along the vertical direction. You put the\nmaterial under 10 MPa of stress along the grain and observe 800 microstrain along\nthe grain. None of the other strain gages read any strain so you conclude that your\ntest was in the principle axis of the material. Find the largest youngs modulus of\nthe wood.\nSolution: The youngs modulus is simply the stress divided by the strain which\nyields a modulus of 12.5 GPa.\n4.4 (1 point) Your test to find the other two youngs moduli does not go as smoothly.\nYou take a piece of material that is thin in the e1 direction and you place it under\n10 MPa of uniaxial tension in some x direction. The tree is not a perfect circle\nand you have trouble orienting your loading in the direction that is the radial\ndirection. Consequently, your strain gages find that the material strained 1000\nmicrostrain in the x direction and -800 microstrain in the other y direction. It also\nstrained 50 microstrain in the direction 45 degrees off from the x axis and the y\naxis. Compute the principal strains in your test and the angle of rotation needed\nto attain a frame of principle strain. Are the principle stresses and strains in the\nsame frame? Comment on if you can find the other two moduli.\nSolution: Using the shear strain transformation equation we can compute the\nangle of rotation needed to get this state of strain into the state of principle\nstrain\n1000 - (-800)\n0 = -\nsin(2θ) + 50 cos(2θ)\n900 = tan(2θ)\nθ = 1.5899\nFrom this we can find that the principle strains are 1000.97 and -800.97 micros-\ntrain so we are very close to a state of principle strain. The frame of principle\nstress and strain do not need to line up if the constitive law is not isotropic. In\nthis case, the wood has a prefered direction that it likes to deform in, and if\nyou accidentally stress the wood at some slight angle to this direction then the\nwood will strain slightly more in the components that areclose to the direction\nin which it is less stiff.\nThe state of stress in this axis is three values as is the state of strain. So this test\ngives us 3 pieces of information regarding our constitutive law. For orthotropic\nPage 15\n\n16.001, M&S - Fall 2020\nHomework #9\n2D materials we have 5 parameters and one constraint from the poisson ratio\nterms being equal. This is four independent unknowns plus the unknown angle\nof the principle axis of the material. So we need to get two more independent\npieces of information about this material to really understand its constitutive\nlaw.\n4.5 (1 point) Another student takes a sample of identical material and cuts it at some\nstrange angle and proceeds with a much more complicated calculation of the kind\nthat you just did. They compute that the youngs moduli in the plane of the wood\nthat they have cut are 9 and 15 GPa. Is this possible given your results?\nSolution: No they cannot find a youngs modulus larger then the largest prin\nciple moduli by cutting in a different plane. The principle axis are the stifffest\nand least stiff directions in the material, so there is no stiffer direction.\n4.6 (1 point) You now take your sample and perform a different uniaxial tension test in\nthe y direction again using 10 MPa. You measure the following strains: 900 micro\nstrain in the y and -850 in the x. You also see -300 microstrain of shear. You are\nconcerned these results are incorrect since the shear strain is so large and you worry\nthis might have caused the test to be performed with some nonzero shear stress.

What parameters influence these values?\nSolution: We would expect large strains in the radial direction at the root of the blade\nsince the loading is largest in this direction. We might expect a similar effect due to the\nincrease in shear loading, but if we consider that the shear loading is small we see that\nthe stress in the radial direction stresses both the fibers and the direction perpendicular to\nthem as the fibers curve. If the fibers are very very strong, then the other direction will\nstrain far more and the shear strain induced by the axial force will be negative. If the fibers\nare not that strong then the axial force will actually contribute positive shear strain. Since\nthe fibers are turning all the time as you proceed along the radial direction, the hydrostatic\npressure is being shifted away from the fiber direction and added to the nonfiber direction.\nThus I would expect that far out along the blade this effect is helpful, but close in where the\nfibers are potentially overloaded relative to the loading on the matrix, there will probably\nbe large positive shearing.\nPage 23\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu/\n16.001 Unified Engineering: Materials and Structures\nFall 2021\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: https://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

The blade is constrained from extensional\nmotion by a ring housing (i.e. the displacement u(L) = 0 at the extremity A), but\nthere is frictionless sliding between the rotating blade and the ring surface. The blade\nis made of a titanium alloy with a mass density ρ = 8470kg · m-3 , a Young's modulus E\n= 80GPa, a cross-sectional area of A0 = 10cm2 and a yield stress of σy = 400MPa.\nL\ne1\ne2\nω\nO\nA\nFigure 1: Rotating blade\n1.1 (1 point) Write down the applicable governing equations and boundary conditions\nfor this problem.

However, even\nthough the force in the nail at x1 = L is zero, the stress σ11(x1 = L) is non-zero (in fact\nthe maximum compressive stress occurs here). This is because we have a singularity at\nx1 = L as both force N(x1) and cross-sectional area A(x1) of the nail go to zero here\nN(x1=L)\n(σ11(x1 = L) =\n→ 0 ), leading to a strange and remarkable result of nonzero stress\nA(x1=L)\nat this location!\nPage 10\n\n16.001, M&S - Fall 2019\nHomework #10\ni Problems M-10.3\n[12 points]\nThe vertical rod shown in Figure 2 is made from an isotropic homogeneous linear elastic\nmaterial (Young's modulus E, coefficient of thermal expansion α).
