These are further meant to help you enjoy and accomplish the course assignments. Most importantly, you should have fun in this course!\n\nReadings\n\nThis semester, there will be two sets of rhetorical texts and speeches that will serve as the primary readings for the class. The first will consist of various articles taking specific positions on the current debate on health care reform. The second set of readings of will consist of three speeches by Abraham Lincoln.\n\nAssignments\n\nThere are several guidelines for using sources in your academic writing:\n\nCite information that is not considered common knowledge, a direct quotation, or a summary of another's words/ideas.\n\nWhen you quote, quote exactly, use quotation marks, and cite the source.\n\nWhen you summarize, you keep the meaning of the source but put it in your own words and cite the original source.\n\nIn sum, your essays should always be your own work. Your essays should always be your\nnew\nwork created specifically for this course.\n\nAttendance\n\nThis course requires your attendance, participation, and on-time submission of assignments:\n\nThere are\n3 penalty-free absence\n; save these for illness, religious reasons, job interviews, etc.\n\nThe\n4th\nabsence lowers your final course grade by half a letter grade; the 5th absence lowers it by an entire letter grade.\n\nThe\n6th\nabsence means\nautomatic failure for the course\n; you should drop the course immediately to avoid its showing up on your transcript.\n\nPlease be on time for class. Chronic lateness or early departure will count as a cut.\n\nIf you have not completed the assignment for the day, you may be counted absent.\n\nThe class on Ses #22 is optional, and will consist of screening and discussion of important political speeches.\n\nGrading\n\nACTIVITIES\n\nPERCENTAGES\n\nPostings\n\n10%\n\nMajor paper 1 and team oral presentation\n\n15%\n\nMajor paper 2\n\n15%\n\nIndividual persuasive paper and revision\n\n20%\n\nIndividual persuasive presentation\n\n10%\n\nLincoln-Douglas debate\n\n10%\n\nPortfolio and portfolio review\n\n5%\n\nClass discussions along with peer and group work; in-class workshops; regular attendance; 2 conferences (1 for persuasive paper and one at the end of semester)\n\n15%\n\nMIT Literature Statement on Plagiarism\n\nPlagiarism -- use of another's intellectual work without acknowledgement -- is a serious offense. It is the policy of the Literature Faculty that students who plagiarize will receive an F in the subject, and that the instructor will forward the case to the Committee on Discipline. Full acknowledgement for all information obtained from sources outside the classroom must be clearly stated in all written work submitted. All ideas, arguments, and direct phrasings taken from someone else's work must be identified and properly footnoted. Quotations from other sources must be clearly marked as distinct from the student's own work.

You are to\nwrite a proposal, a complete draft of a paper, present a 6-8 minute speech, and then\nsubmit a revision of the original draft.\nAudience:\nFor purposes of persuasion, your audience is this class. Aim your arguments to your\nclassmates.\nTopic:\nThe topic can be:\n1. a proposal to change something at MIT; the change can involve academic policy,\na particular class or requirement, residential life, or any other aspect of MIT that\naffects you and your classmates.\n2. a proposal to change something based on scientific or technical information.\n3. any other topic that would be an appropriate argument to this audience\nRemember, who your audience is. You are trying to move them to some sort of action.\nHowever, the action can occur in the future. (The first time I used this assignment was\n1999. One student presentation was on hybrid cars. One of his main points was that\nhybrids became economical viable only when gasoline was close to $3.00 per gallon. I\nbought my Prius two years ago.)\n\nProposal Due 3 weeks after SES #8 (150-250 words):\nYour proposal should be handed in electronically, but bring 2 hard copy versions to class.\nThe proposal should have:\n1. Your thesis statement - a one sentence statement of what you are trying to\nconvince us to do and why. It (or a following sentence) should address counter\narguments. A thesis sentence is a claim you are proving to your audience; it\nnever consists of questions. For more information on writing a thesis sentence\nsee http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~wricntr/documents/Thesis.html.\n2. A few sentences giving the background and identifying the problem that you are\ngoing to solve. (Remember, there has to be a problem or there is no reason for\nchange.)\n3. An elaboration of your thesis statement.\n4. Identification of counter arguments, other solutions, or both.\n5. Sources of information.\nDraft Due Wednesday, SES #17:\nSubmit electronically a complete draft of the paper. The paper should contain the\nfollowing elements.\n1. Title page with title, your name, date, and class number.\n2. Introduction giving background, identifying the problem, and prominently\nfeaturing your thesis statement.\n3.

Because the intelligibility advantage of clear/slow over conv/slow speech was comparable to that of\nclear/normal over conv/normal for nearly all talkers and listeners, it was also shown that over this range of\nspeaking rates (slow through normal), the relative intelligibility benefit of clear speech is largely independent\nspeaking rates (slow through normal), the relative intelligibility benefit of clear speech is largely independent\nof rate, talker, and listener.\n\nWhile the intelligibility advantage of clear speech did not extend to quick rates, as shown by the fact that\nm2clear<m2conv for all talkers, it could still exist at faster than normal rates. Assuming physiological\nconstraints on articulation, the intelligibility of clear speech at very high speaking rates must decrease more\nrapidly than the intelligibility of conversational speech in order to compensate for its higher intelligibility.\nConsequently, clear speech cannot maintain an intelligibility advantage above a certain \"cutoff\" speaking\nt\nY t\nith th\nli\nit d\nb\nf\nt\nth t\ni\nd i\nthi\nt d\nl\nl\nb\nd (\nl\nt\nrate. Yet, with the limited number of rates that were examined in this study, only a lower bound (normal rates\nof roughly 200 wpm) on the cutoff rate was established. At least some of the talkers (T1 and T3) appear likely\nto have exceeded this lower bound, producing clear/quick speech that could be more intelligible than\nconversational speech at comparable rates, if such conversational speech had been elicited. Moreover, since\nthe training provided in this study increased the cutoff rate beyond those previously reported, it is possible\nthat additional training could increase the cutoff rate even further.\n\nSubjective comments from talkers regarding the training procedure indicated that the listener feedback\n\nSubjective comments from talkers regarding the training procedure indicated that the listener feedback\nprovided during training was very helpful for developing clear speech. In particular, one talker noted that\ntrends in listener responses raised his awareness of common phoneme confusions. He reported that this\ninformation was useful in deciding which phonemes to emphasize. Other talkers expressed interest in\nlistening to speech distorted by multiplicative noise in order to gain information on how to speak more\nclearly. This request suggests that some talkers believe they have natural strategies for speaking clearly in\ndifficult communication situations.
