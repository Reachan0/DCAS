  "course_name": "Jewish History from Biblical to Modern Times",
  "course_description": "This course explores how our views of Jewish history have been formed and how this history can explain the survival of the Jews as an ethnic/religious group into the present day. Special attention is given to the partial and fragmentary nature of our information about the past, and the difficulties inherent in decoding statements about the past that were written with a religious agenda in mind. It also considers complex events in Jewish history â€“ from early history as portrayed in the Bible to recent history, including the Holocaust.",

  "syllabus_content": "Course Meeting Times\n\nLectures: 1 session / week, 3 hours / session\n\nSyllabus Archive\n\nThe following syllabi come from a variety of different terms. They illustrate the evolution of this course over time, and are intended to provide alternate views into the instruction of this course.\n\nFall 2010, Peter Temin (\nPDF\n)\n\nFall 2009, Peter Temin (\nPDF\n)\n\nFall 2008, Peter Temin (\nPDF\n)\n\nFall 2007, Peter Temin (\nPDF\n)\n\nCourse Description\n\nThis subject provides a comprehensive overview of Jewish history from Biblical times to today. The discussion will focus on two questions. First, how do we \"know\" what we think we know of Jewish history? This of course is a central question of all history. Since the subject ranges over a wide range of times and places, it is not surprising that the readings are based on a wide range of evidence. Second, how have Jews survived as a continuous ethnic/religious group? They are unique in the length of time they have existed with a continuous history. We will seek to discover what is durable about the Jewish experience that has led to this longevity.\n\nThe subject uses recent scholarship in English to suggest answers to these questions. Only English is required for this subject, but there is a lot of reading and writing. Readings should be done before the relevant class to make the class discussion relevant to the comprehension of the reading and the readings relevant to the class discussion. The dates on the syllabus show when the assigned readings will be discussed; they should be read completely by those dates.\n\nThis subject is funded by a gift from the Dennis W. and Jane B. Carlton Foundation.\n\nCourse Requirements\n\nThe subject requires two types of written exercises: papers and exams. Credit will be given for papers, class participation, and exams in that order.\n\nPapers\n\nThis course requires two essays of about eight to ten pages each, due on Week #4 and Week #11. The first essay will be methodological, about the methods and sources of history. It is appropriate to write this paper early in the subject because the readings on the early years reveal the most varied historical evidence. The second paper will be an attempt for each student to answer the second question of the course: Why have Jews survived as a group? The paper should also discuss each student's relationship to a religion (whatever it may be), with attention to the long-term attractiveness of this religion as well as its current appeal. For more detailed instructions for the papers, please see\nassignments\n.\n\nExams\n\nThere will be two exams on the readings in class time as shown on the syllabus.\n\nGrading Criteria\n\nREQUIREMENTS\n\nPERCENTAGES\n\nTwo papers (30% each)\n\n60%\n\nTwo exams (20% each)\n\n40%\n\nCalendar\n\nWEEK #\n\nTOPICS\n\nKEY DATES\n\nThe Torah\n\nThe bible as history\n\nLife in biblical Israel\n\nJewish revolts\n\nPaper 1 due\n\nReligoius change in Roman times\n\nThe first millennium and Maimonides\n\nExam on readings\n\nExam 1\n\nMedieval Jews\n\nEarly modern Jewry\n\nJews in interwar Europe\n\nThe Holocaust\n\nPaper 2 due\n\nThe Mandate and Israel\n\nJews in the United States\n\nExam on readings\n\nExam 2\n\nReview, summary, and discussion",
