Lectures will be accompanied by field trips to collect air samples for the analysis of gases, aerosols and clouds by the students. Students taking the graduate version complete different assignments.\n\nGrading\n\nACTIVITIES\n\nPERCENTAGES\n\nLaboratory Reports\n\nPresentations\n\nGeneral Participation\n\nLaboratory Reports:\n\nFor the first lab report, please answer the questions directly in complete sentences, with attached graphs if necessary. The first lab report will be graded for (1) scientific content and (2) effectiveness of communication and returned approximately one week after it is handed in. You will then revise the lab report and resubmit it for partial additional credit. The following reports will progressively become more like a short research paper.\n\nPresentations:\n\nEach student will present 2 of the 3 labs. All students will give a presentation for the first lab section and then decide between either the second or the third. The presentations will be 10-15 minutes and discuss the background, importance, data used, analysis and results.\n\nGeneral Participation:\n\nYou will be expected to participate in and ask questions during class. This includes questions during the laboratory presentation. There will be feedback questionnaires based on each set of presentations, which will be handed in at the start of the next class.\n\nAdditional Grading Policies\n\nLaboratory Reports:\n\nLab reports are due at the start of the class after the presentations are completed. This will allow you to incorporate comments from the presentations into your lab report. We caution that you should start the report well before the presentation day, if you wait until afterward as may not have sufficient time to finish. Comments / grades on lab reports are returned approximately one week later. Students will revise the first lab report based on the comments to earn back partial credit by the resubmission due date, which is 1 week after the lab reports are returned. Late lab reports are penalized by making the maximum possible grade be a declining fraction of full credit. Lab reports have a maximum of 75% credit if turned in a day late and 50% credit when turned in two days late. Lab reports turned in more than two days late will have a maximum grade of 25%. This policy is also in effect for the resubmitted reports after the resubmission due date. The report must be resubmitted for CI-M credit. Furthermore, if the first report is not resubmitted an additional 25% will be subtracted from the original grade (e. g. an original grade of 90% will instead become 65%).\n\nPresentations and Participation:\n\nPresentations will be submitted to the Teaching Assistants (TAs) via email before the start of the (first) presentation class. This will allow the TAs to have presentation on the course computer for that class. Absence will only be excused with a doctor's note or other similar documentation (see below). In only this case students will be given the opportunity to make up the presentation in a future class. Presentations represent 20% of the final grade.\n\nStudents will show up for all presentations regardless of if they are presenting. During each presentation you will be expected to participate by asking questions of your peers. You will also return a feedback report on the presentations the next day of class. Participation in class and presentations represents 10% of the final grade.\n\nField Trips and Laboratory Work:\n\nStudents must make all field trips and show up for all laboratory experiments. If the TA can manage, a make-up field trip or laboratory appointment can be offered but this should not be expected.\n\nStatement on Group Work:\n\nYou will be working in groups during laboratory and field experiments and are free to collaborate on the measurements and other group work that will form the basis of your individual presentations and reports. However, all the slides in your presentations and all the text and graphs in your reports should be your own work. Copying another person's assignment text, data or figures will not be tolerated and will result in a lower grade. All work should be fully referenced. For a general discussion of academic integrity, please see \"\nAcademic Integrity at MIT\n\".\n\nSpecial Circumstances:\n\nThe penalties described above can be forgiven under special circumstances (for example, personal reasons, health reasons, etc.) if the student provides documentation from Student Services, a doctor or another reputable source.",

From mass-balance\nof CO2, we can formulate the time rate of change of CO2 molar concentration.\ndC\ndh\nΔxΔyh\nbl = Q + uΔxh(Cup - C\n\nbl) + ΔxΔy\n(Cent - Cbl)\n(1)\ndt\ndt\nwhere,\nCbl:\n\nCO\n2 concentration in mol/m for planetary boundary layer.\nCup: CO\n2 concentration in mol/m , for upwind box\n\nCent: CO2 concentration in mol/m3 above boundary layer\nΔx and Δy: lateral length of the box (m)\nQ: emission rate in mol/sec\nu: wind speed to the box in m/s\nh: boundary layer height in m\nDividing both sides by ΔxΔyh gives\ndCbl\nq\n1 dh\n=\n+\n(Cup - Cbl) +\n(Cent - Cbl)\n(2)\ndt\nh\nτ\nh dt\nwhere, τ is the residence time of air over the area of the box (τ = Δy/u), and q is the\nemission rate of CO\n2 per unit area (mol m-s-) (see Seinfeld and Pandis, eq 25.13 and\n25.14, p.1098). The first term, second and third terms on the right hand side represent\nsource flux, advection and entrainment, respectively. The entrainment term only applies\nwhen boundary layer heigh is increasing (dh/dt > 0). One can solve the equation (2)\nnumerically. That is,\n\nFigure 1: Dimensions and parameters for the box model\n+1\n\nCn\n\n- Cn\nn\n\nq\n1 hn+1\nhn\nbl\nbl =\n+\n(Cn\nup - Cn\nbl) +\nΔ\nn\n-\n\n(\nn\n\nΔt\n- Cn\nCent\nbl)\n(3)\nt\nh\nτ\nhn\nwhere, n + 1 and n superscript represent values at time step n and n + 1, where\nn+1\n\nt\n= tn + Δt\n\nn+1\nn\n\nn\nq\n\nhn +1\nhn\n\nC\n= Cbl +\n+ (Cn - Cn\n\n-\n(Cn\nCn\nup\nbl) Δt +\nent -\nbl)\n(4)\nbl\nhn\nτ\nhn\nOnce we know Cn, one can integrate with time to\n\nsolve Cn+1.\nConcentration and Mixing Ratios\nIt is important, however, to realize that the air becomes thiner at high altitude. It is\nconvenient to use mixing ratios rather than volume concentrations to express mass-balance\nequation since mixing ratio is conservative within boundary layer whereas volume con\ncentration of CO2 change with altitude. From balance of force (Seinfeld and Pandis, p\n9),\n(p(z) - p(z + Δz))ΔA = ρgΔAΔz\n(5)\nwhere p is the pressure at altitude z and z + Δz, ρ, g, are density of air (e.g., kg/m3)\nand acceleration due to gravity (m/s-2), pressure is in Pascal. The molar concentration of\nair at altitude between z and z + Δz is:\np(z) - p(z + Δz)\nCair =\n(6)\nMairgΔz\n\nwhere, Mair is molecular weight of air (28.97 g/mol). Molar concentration of CO2 is\nrelated to the mixing ratio (mbl) of CO2 as:\nCbl = mbl · Cair,bl\n(ps\n= mbl\n- p\n·\nh)\n(7)\nMairgh\nhere, ps and ph are the pressure at surface and boundary layer height (h). The source\nflux and advection terms in equation (2) can be written as (assuming h and ph does not\nchange with time?):\ndmbl\nMairg\n=\nq +\n(mup - mbl)\n(8)\ndt\n(ps - ph)\nτ\nFor the entrainment term, mass-balance is:\nΔxΔyhCbl = ΔxΔyΔhCent + ΔxΔy(h + Δh)(Cbl + ΔCbl)\n(9)\napplying equation (7),\n(ps - ph)mbl + (Δp)ment = (ps - ph + Δp)(mbl + Δmbl)\n(10)\nRearrangement and neglecting the second order term (ΔpΔmbl) gives:,\nΔp\nΔmbl =\n(ment\nmbl)\n(11)\nps\n-\n- ph\nDividing both sides by Δt, and Δt → 0, gives\ndmbl\ndp\n=\n(m\n\nm )\n(12)\ndt\nps -\n\nent\n\n-\nbl\nph dt\nAgain, the entrainment term only applies when boundary layer height is increasing\n(i.e., dh/dt >0 and thus dp/dt < 0). Therefore, the full mass-balance equation in terms of\nmixing ratio and pressure is:\ndmbl\nMairg\ndp\n=\nq +\n(mup - mbl) +\n(ment - mbl)\n(13)\ndt\n(ps - ph)\nτ\nps - ph dt\nBoundary Layer Height\nnote: This part will be updated for 2013 meteorological data.\nWe will use the following harmonic function for the pressure at the top of boundary\nlayer (ph) as a function of time (t in hours),\n\nm\n2πkt\n2πkt\nph(t) =\nf\naksin\n\n+ bkcos\n\n+ a0\n(14)\nk=1\nI used up to 4th harmonics (i.e., m = 4) to fit PBLH estimated from NAM (North\nAmerican Mesoscale) model output for Boston from October 18 00 am to October 30\n23pm (EST-daylight saving time)\nTable 1: Coefficients for harmonic fitting\nk\nak\nbk\n75.2235\n62.8391\n-29.1925\n8.0102\n-7.4486\n6.5066\n1.9185\n-11.6844\na0 =\n931.7713\nLaboratory Activity\nMy MATLA B (r) file is provided for initial model set up.

Some of these droplets\nare then carried by winds to higher\nlayers and evaporate to become dry sea\nsalt particles.\n\nSea Salt - bubble burst mechanism\nFilm drains and thins\nAir\nOcean water\nJet drop\nFilm\nfragments\nCapillary\nwaves\nUnstable jet\nNew bubble\nFilm fragments\nFlow down sides of cavity\n(A)\n(C)\n(B)\n(D)\nFigure by MIT OpenCourseWare.\n\nSea Salt - bubble burst mechanism\nPruppacher and Klett\nMason (1957)\nBlanchard (1963, Max)\nMason (1954)\n3% NaCl Solution (Day, 1964)\nFiltered Ocean Water (Day, 1964)\nBubble Diameter (mm)\n0.1\n0.0\n1.0\n2.0\n3.0\n4.0\nNumber of Droplets Per Bubble\nMean number of droplets resulting from the disintegration of\nan air bubble cap in salt water as a function of equivalent\ndiameter of the air bubble.\nFilm drains and thins\nAir\nOcean water\nJet drop\nFilm\nfragments\nCapillary\nwaves\nUnstable jet\nNew bubble\nFilm fragments\nFlow down sides of cavity\n(A)\n(C)\n(B)\n(D)\nFigure by MIT OpenCourseWare.\nFigure by MIT OpenCourseWare.\n\nMineral Dust\nPruppacher and Klett\nThis image has been removed due to copyright restrictions.\nPlease see the image on page: http://www.microlabgallery.com/gallery/\nCoal%20Dust%20668-99%20N%20Side%20100X%202.aspx.\nImage courtesy of NASA.\nhttp://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Saltation-mechanics.gif\nThis image has been removed due to copyright restrictions.\nPlease see: http://41.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lui4qyZPB-\nt1r1qmaso1_500.jpg.\nRange of wind speed and grain size in which saltation\nof quartz grains can occur in the atmosphere.\nWind Too Violent\n(Grains enter into suspension)\n)\n-1\nec\ns\nSaltation Possible\nm\n(c\ny\nelocit\nV\nFriction\nWind Too Feeble\n0.05\n0.10\n0.15\n0.20\nGrain Diameter (cm)\nFigure by MIT OpenCourseWare.\n\nBiological Aerosol\nThis image has been removed due to copyright restrictions.\nPlease see the image on page:\nhttp://sciencenetlinks.com/media/filer/2011/10/24/fungi.jpg.\nThis image has been removed due to copyright restrictions.\nPlease see the image on page: https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.\ncom/200x150/01/7d/8e/017d8e94f96f27972c21ca35bb566a52.jpg.\n\nPrimary Volcanic Emissions\nImage courtesy of USGS.\nhttp://www.hko.gov.hk/blog/en/archives/00000107.htm\nVolcanic Ash From 1989\nMt.

Also shown is the ideal solution behavior.\nNote that because NaCl dissociates into two ions, the number of equivalents in solution is twice the number of moles of NaCl. For\n(NH4)2SO4, the number of ions in solution is three times the number of dissolved salt moles. In calculating the number of moles in\nsolution, ns, a dissociated molecule that has dissociated into i ions is treated as i molecules, whereas an undissociated molecule is\ncounted only once. A similar diagram is given in Figure 17.4, using now the concentration of salt as the independent variable. Solutes\nthat dissociate (e.g., salts) reduce the vapor pressure of water more than do solutes that do not dissociate, and this reduction\ndepends strongly on the type of salt.\n\n(c) John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Some suggest decreases in hailfall (reduction\nof 20-50%), while others have produced inconclusive results, and\nsome suggest increases.\n2.

Sea salt, for example, is believed to have a positive effect on health. Man-made\nsources of particulates, however, are rarely harmless. In towns and cities, these are\nextensively from diesel vehicle exhausts. The effects of man-made particulate emissions are\nconsidered detrimental due to their composition, containing mainly unburned fuel oil and\npolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) that are known to be carcinogenic among\nlaboratory animals. Particulates may originate from many other sources including cement\nmanufacturing processes, incineration and power generation, so localized particulate pollution\nis common. The sizes of particles are important when assessing their effects on health. PM2.5\nand PM10 as well as total suspended particulates are routinely monitored. This is due to the\nfact that particles of less than 2.5-10 micro-meters (mm) in diameter can penetrate\ndeep into the lung and cause more damage, as opposed to larger particles that may be\nfiltered out through the airways' natural mechanisms.\nOzone Ozone is created by the action of sunlight on CO, volatile organic compounds (VOCs)\nand nitrogen oxides over 1-3 day time periods. This results in ozone being widely dispersed\nas a pollutant, and can form in greater concentrations in rural areas. As ozone concentrations\nare particularly dependant on sunlight, episodes are always likely to develop following\nsustained periods of warmth and calm weather. Ozone is a toxic gas that can bring\nirreversible damage to the respiratory tract and lung tissue if delivered in high\nquantities. Levels during air pollution episodes range up to 100-250 ppb (0.1-0.25\nppm). At these concentrations ozone impairs lung function and causes irritation to\nthe respiratory tract. Asthmatics are especially affected.\n\nOxides of Nitrogen The oxides of most concern are nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide\n(NO2). The latter is more damaging to health, due to the toxic nature of this gas. NO\nis emitted to the atmosphere as a primary pollutant, from traffic and power stations, and is\noxidized to nitrogen dioxide following dispersal. Health effects of exposure to NO2 include\nshortness of breath and chest pains. The effects of NO include changes to lung function at high\nconcentrations.\nCarbon Monoxide Carbon monoxide combines with hemoglobin, the oxygen carrying\ncomponent of the blood stream, to form carboxy-hemoglobin (COHb) which can be life-\nthreatening in high doses. The effects of CO pollution are more damaging to pregnant women\nand their fetus. Research into smoking during pregnancy shows that concentrations within the\nblood stream of unborn infants is as high as 12%, causing retardation of the unborn child's\ngrowth and mental development.\nLead Lead is still a serious air pollutant especially to those living near to areas of dense traffic\nin cities where leaded fuel is still used or to coal-fired power plants. Damage to the central\nnervous system, kidneys and brain can result when levels in the blood reach\nconcentrations of 800 mg/liter. Much of the concern regarding pollution from lead centers\naround its effects on child health. Children exhibit vulnerability to the toxic effects of lead at\nmuch lower concentrations than for adults. There is a strong link between high lead exposures\nand impaired intelligence.\nSulfur dioxide The health effects of sulfur dioxide include heart disease and bronchitis. SO2\nemissions have been significantly reduced through legislative measures in developed countries.\nAsthmatics are especially sensitive for whom concentrations above 125 ppb may result in a fall\nin lung function. Tightness in the chest and coughing may also result at levels approaching 400\nppb. At levels above 400 ppb the lung function of asthmatics may be impaired to the\nextent that medical help is required. Sulfur dioxide pollution is more harmful when\nparticulate and other pollution concentrations are also high (the synergistic effect).\n\nVolatile Organic Compounds (VOCs)\nSome VOCs are directly harmful, including: Benzene which may increase susceptibility to\nleukemia, if exposure is maintained over a period of time; Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons\n(PAH) some of which can cause cancer (there are several hundred different forms of PAH, and\nsources can be both natural and man-made); Dioxins, whose sources include manufacturing of\norganic compounds as well as the incineration of wastes and various other combustion\nprocesses involving chlorinated compounds, and which has health effects due to inhalation\nand ingestion (e.g. dioxins entering the food chain from soils); 1,3 Butadiene, for which there is\nan apparent correlation between exposure and a higher risk of cancer, and which is produced\nfrom manufacturing of synthetic rubbers, gasoline-driven vehicles and cigarette smoke.\nGeneral Air Quality Problems\nAir quality indoors Many different compounds are contained in tobacco smoke, including carbon\nmonoxide, ammonia, dioxins and PAH; the latter two are thought to be carcinogenic. Other\nsources of indoor pollution include particulates from mineral fibers as well as household dust.\nDust in buildings is known to cause problems including fatigue and nausea. One of the most\npressing concerns with indoor air pollution is with carbon monoxide built up from gas, oil or\nwood fired appliances. Open gas flames and fire places also produce BC.\nAsthma and air pollution There has been a steady rise in the number of reported asthma cases\nsince the 1970s, and air pollution problems are believed to be a significant (but not sole)\ncontributor to the rise. High concentrations of nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, ozone and\nparticulates (especially PM10) can all trigger breathing difficulties in asthmatics.\n\nNATIONAL\nAMBIENT\nAIR QUALITY\nSTANDARDS\n(NAAQS)\n\nOZONE MONITORING\nNETWORK\nIN NEW ENGLAND\nHigh concentrations of ozone near ground\nlevel can be harmful to people, animals,\ncrops, and other materials. Ozone can\nirritate your respiratory system, causing\nyou to start coughing, feel an irritation in\nyour throat and/or experience an\nuncomfortable sensation in your chest.\nOzone can aggravate asthma, and can\ninflame and damage cells that line your\nlungs. Ozone may also aggravate chronic\nlung diseases such as emphysema and\nbronchitis and reduce the immune\nsystem's ability to fight off bacterial\ninfections in the respiratory system. Lastly,\nozone may cause permanent lung\ndamage. These effects can be worse in\nchildren and exercising adults\nImage courtesy of EPA.\n\nO3 at BOSTON - LONG ISLAND STATION (Operating 1999 to Present)\nYear\nTotal\nDays\n>\n0.084\n1st\nHigh\n(ppm)\nDate\n2nd\nHigh\n(ppm)\nDate\n3rd\nHigh\n(ppm)\nDate\n4th\nHigh\n(ppm)\nDate\nMAP\n0.102\nJuly\n0.100\nJune\n0.089 June 1 0.087\nMay\n*\n0.084\nJune\n0.073 June 1 0.072\nAug 9\n0.070 June 2\n0.111\nJune\n0.107\nJune\n0.100\nAug 2\n0.094\nJuly\n0.126\nAug\n0.117\nAug\n0.102\nJuly 3\n0.102\nSept 9\n*\n0.102\nJune\n0.083\nJune\n0.078\nJune\n0.078\nJuly 4\n0.094 June 8 0.081\nJuly\n0.080\nJuly\n0.079\nJuly\n0.095\nJune\n0.091\nJune\n0.089\nAug\n0.086\nJune\n0.083\nJune\n0.083\nJuly 2\n0.083\nJuly\n0.079\nJuly 1\n0.082\nSept\n0.080\nApril\n0.076\nSept\n0.073\nAug 3\n\nREGIONAL OZONE HEALTH ALERTS IN NEW ENGLAND\nBASED ON THE MONITORING NETWORK.

This will allow you to\nincorporate comments from the presentations into your lab report. We caution that you should start the\nreport well before the presentation day, if you wait until afterward as may not have sufficient time to\nfinish. Comments/grades on lab reports are returned approximately one week later. Students will revise\nthe first lab report based on the comments to earn back partial credit by the resubmission due date,\nwhich is 1 week after the lab reports are returned. Late lab reports are penalized by making the\nmaximum possible grade be a declining fraction of full credit. Lab reports have a maximum of 75%\ncredit if turned in a day late and 50% credit when turned in two days late. Lab reports turned in more\nthan two days late will have a maximum grade of 25%. This policy is also in effect for the resubmitted\nreports after the resubmission due date. The report MUST be resubmitted for CI-M credit.\nFurthermore, if the first report is not resubmitted an additional 25% will be subtracted from the original\ngrade (e. g. an original grade of 90% will instead become 65%).\nPresentations and Participation\nPresentations will be submitted to the TAs via email before the start of the (first) presentation class.\nThis will allow the TAs to have presentation on the course computer for that class. Absence will only\nbe excused with a doctor's note or other similar documentation (see below). In only this case students\nwill be given the opportunity to make up the presentation in a future class. Presentations represent\n20% of the final grade.\nStudents will show up for all presentations regardless of if they are presenting. During each\npresentation you will be expected to participate by asking questions of your peers. You will also return\na feedback report on the presentations the next day of class. Participation in class and presentations\nrepresents 10% of the final grade.\nField Trips and Laboratory Work\nStudents must make all field trips and show up for all laboratory experiments. If the TA can manage, a\nmake-up field trip or laboratory appointment can be offered but this should not be expected.\nStatement on Group Work\nYou will be working in groups during laboratory and field experiments and are free to collaborate on\nthe measurements and other group work that will form the basis of your individual presentations and\nreports. However, all the slides in your presentations and all the text and graphs in your reports should\nbe your own work. Copying another person's assignment text, data or figures will not be tolerated\nand will result in a lower grade. All work should be fully referenced. For a general discussion of\nacademic integrity at MIT, please see http://web.mit.edu/academicintegrity/.\nSpecial Circumstances\nThe penalties described above can be forgiven under special circumstances (for example, personal\nreasons, health reasons, etc.) if the student provides documentation from Student Services, a doctor or\nanother reputable source.\n\nSummary of the chemistry in the troposphere important in air\npollution and climate.
