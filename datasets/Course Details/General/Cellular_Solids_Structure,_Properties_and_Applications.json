Cellular solids are widespread in nature and in engineering. Natural cellular solids include wood, cork, plant leaves and stems, trabecular bone and the extracellular matrix to which biological cells attach in the body. Engineering honeycombs and foams can be made from polymers, metals, ceramics, glasses and composites. Their unique properties are exploited in applications such as lightweight structural panels, energy absorption devices and thermal insulation. In medicine, their behavior is of interest in understanding increased fracture risk due to trabecular bone loss in patients with osteoporosis, in the development of metal foam coatings for orthopedic implants and in designing porous scaffolds for tissue engineering that mimic the extracellular matrix.\n\nText\n\nGibson, L.

      "content": "Cellular Solids Project\n\nImage study of the failure mechanisms in dry trabecular whale bone during\nfracture toughness tests\nBruno Goncalves da Silva\n\nAbstract\nThe study of the fracturing of trabecular bone is of particular interest to improve the current knowledge of\nbone failure that may occur due to osteoporosis and metastatic or benign skeletal tumors, or even due to\naccidental overloading of a bone. While much effort has been put in experimentally measuring elastic and\nyield properties of trabecular bone, the fracture toughness and fracturing processes of trabecular bone\nsubject to Mode I loading needs to be better understood.\nIn this project, dry whale trabecular bone is used to study the fracturing mechanisms that occur when\nspecimens are loaded in three-point bending with an initial mid-span notch. These analyses include the\nuse of a High-Resolution (HR) and a High-Speed Video (HSV) cameras in order to capture the\ndevelopment of cracks and to identify the mechanisms responsible for their propagation. The apparent\nand solid densities of the specimens were also measured and related to the fracture toughnesses obtained\nfrom the three-point bending tests.\nFrom the three-point bending tests performed, it was found that (1) some trabeculae develop in a radial\nfashion (radial trabeculae), from a focal point approximately at the center of the whale vertebra, (2) there\nis a strong correlation between the maximum vertical load reached and the slope of the load-displacement\ncurve in the linear elastic regime, (3) the fractures initiate at the notch tip and usually propagate without\nbranching and by stages, causing a load drop every time they propagate, (4) the fracture toughnesses are\nhigher in the specimens cut in the same plane as the radial trabeculae than those parallel to the axis of the\nvertebra (5) the fracture toughness appears to increase from the outside of the vertebra to the focal point\nof the radial trabeculae.\n\nContents\n\nIntroduction ........................................................................................................................................... 3\nMethodology ......................................................................................................................................... 6\n2.1\nSpecimen Preparation ................................................................................................................... 6\n2.2\nGeometry of the specimens ........................................................................................................... 6\n2.3\nRelative Density Measurement ..................................................................................................... 8\n2.4\nTest setup ...................................................................................................................................... 9\nTest results .......................................................................................................................................... 11\n3.1\nSpecimens with a = 0.25 inches ( 0.64 cm) .............................................................................. 11\n3.2\nSpecimens with a = 0.50 inches (1.27 cm) ............................................................................... 13\n3.3\nMaximum load vs slope of the load-deflection curves in the linear elastic regime .................... 15\n3.4\nHigh-Resolution Camera observations ....................................................................................... 15\n3.5\nHigh-Speed Video camera observations ..................................................................................... 17\nRelative density and fracture toughness of the specimens .................................................................. 18\nSummary and Conclusions.................................................................................................................. 20\nReferences ........................................................................................................................................... 21\nAppendices .......................................................................................................................................... 23\n7.1\nSpecimens and Cracks Dimensions ............................................................................................ 23\n7.2\nRelative Density and Fracture Toughness Calculations .............................................................. 24\n7.3\nImage Analyses ........................................................................................................................... 26\n\n1 Introduction\nInvestigating the mechanical properties of bone is important to better understand how its cortex and\ntrabecular portions deform and fail. Specifically, the study of the fracturing behavior of trabecular bone is\nof particular interest to improve the current knowledge of bone failure due to osteoporosis and metastatic\nor benign skeletal tumors, or even due to accidental overloading.\nSeveral authors have been measuring the mechanical properties of trabecular bone experimentally:\nBayraktar et al. (2004) and Keavenly et al. (1994 and 1999), for instance, used uniaxial compressive and\ntensile tests to determine the yield strength and Elastic Modulus of trabecular bone, while Cook and\nZioupos (2009) used compact and three-point bending tests to determine fracture toughness of human\ntrabecular bone. Others have also collected imaging data in their experiments in order to improve their\nunderstanding of the deformation and failure mechanisms in bone: Hardisty et al. (2013) and Thurner et\nal. (2009) used High-Speed Video cameras to image tension tests in cortical bone of race horses and\nuniaxial compressive tests in human trabecular bone, respectively. The latter also used the Scanning\nElectron Microscope (SEM) to evaluate why whitening of the trabecular bone occurs when it is\nsignificantly loaded. Micro-photographs were also used by Fyhrie and Schaffler (1994) to assess the\nvarious failure mechanisms of trabecular bone when tested under uniaxial compression, while micro-CT\nimagery was used by Nagaraja et al. (2005) and Muller et al. (1998) during micro-compression tests in\norder to observe damage initiation, propagation and accumulation.\nDespite the number and thoroughness of experiments performed in trabecular bone, not many researchers\nhave experimentally measured Mode I fracture toughness of trabecular bone while simultaneously\nstudying the mechanisms involved in crack propagation using imaging data. In this project, dry whale\ntrabecular bone is used to study the fracturing mechanisms that occur when specimens are loaded in three-\npoint bending with an initial mid-span notch. These analyses include the use of a High-Resolution (HR)\nand a High-Speed Video (HSV) cameras in order to capture the development of cracks and to identify the\nmechanisms responsible for their propagation.\nThe vertebra investigated is one of the first caudal vertebrae of a Humpback whale (as highlighted in\nFigure 1 which shows the skeleton of a Sperm whale, very similar to the skeleton of a Humpback whale,\nparticularly the vertebral column) that was gently provided by the Massachusetts Division of Fisheries\nand Wildlife (MassWildlife) to Professor Lorna Gibson. The body of the whale washed out in Deer's\nIsland, Massachusetts, and its skeleton was preserved by MassWildlife. The trabecular portion of the\nwhale vertebrae used in this project has a pentagonal shape with the sides measuring from 5\" to 6.5\" (12.5\ncm to 16 cm), approximately, as shown in Figure 2. The whale vertebra was chosen due to the very\n\nuniform and large trabecular portion of the bone, which makes specimen preparation simpler and test\nresults more consistent between different specimens.\nThe main goals of this study are:\n-\nMeasure Mode I fracture toughness of dry trabecular whale bone subject to three-point bending\ntests;\n-\nAnalyze the fracturing processes which occur in dry trabecular whale bone subject to three-point\nbending tests using High-Speed Video (to observe the quick propagation of cracks near a load\npeak) and High-Resolution images (to observe the changes in the trabecular bone throughout the\ntest).\n-\nRelate Mode I fracture toughness with the relative density of the trabecular bone studied;\n-\nEvaluate the spatial variation of relative density of dry trabecular bone of a whale vertebra.\nThis report is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the methodology used in the project, including\nhow the specimens were prepared and how their relative densities were measured, as well as the setup\nused to perform the three-point bending tests. Section 3 shows the results obtained in the three-point\nbending tests, not only the load-displacement behavior but also its correlation with the imaging data\ncollected during the test. Section 4 relates the relative density with the fracture toughness of the different\nspecimens tested, and analyzes the spatial variation of the relative density of the trabecular bone studied.\nSection 5 provides a summary and conclusions reached in the project. At the end of this report, an\nAppendix section provides the detailed measurements and calculation of the relative density and fracture\ntoughness of the specimens, as well as the most relevant imaging data obtained in the tests\n\nFigure 1 - Sperm whale skeleton showing vertebra under study, one of the first caudal vertebrae (adapted from\nAboe, G, www.onceinawhale.com, 2013)\n\nCourtesy of Kurzon on Wikimedia Commons.

These beams were then tested in three-point bending. The methodologies used in these\ndifferent stages are described in the following subsections.\n2.1\nSpecimen Preparation\nThe whale bone was first cut with an OMAX waterjet into a cube with approximately 4.5\" (12 cm) of\nside length, as shown in Figure 3a. Second, in order to avoid the tapering caused by cutting relatively\nthick specimens with the waterjet, a wet-saw was used to cut the cube in half, as shown in Figure 3b, and\nsubsequently in smaller beams.\n\na)\nb)\nFigure 3 - a) Cube cut with the waterjet and b) top and bottom halves of the cube after being cut with a wet-saw.\n2.2\nGeometry of the specimens\nThe twelve beams cut with the wet-saw are approximately 4.0\" (11 cm)-long, 1.0\" (2.5cm)-wide and 0.5\"\n(1.2 cm)-thick, following the ratios proposed by ASTM E-1820 which are shown in Figure 4. Two\ndifferent cutting orientations were used, as illustrated in Figure 5: four of the beams were cut with their\nwidth (W) perpendicular to the axis of the vertebra - Orientation 1, also called in this report direction in\nthe same plane as the radial trabecula - and eight beams were cut with their thickness (B) perpendicular to\nthe axis of the vertebra - Orientation 2, also called direction parallel to the axis of the vertebra. Two\ndifferent lengths of the initial crack were considered, namely 0.5\" (1.27 cm) and 0.25\" (0.64 cm). These\ncracks were created using a mechanical circular saw to open the first 4/5 of the crack length, and\nsubsequently a razor blade to manually open the remaining 1/5 of the crack.\n\nFigure 4 - Geometry of the specimens to be used in the 3-point bending tests (in Cook and Zioupos, 2009)\n\nFigure 5 - Cutting orientations of the specimens used in the tests, with blue lines and blue circle showing the radial direction of\nthe trabeculae and focal point of the radial trabeculae, respectively\nTable 1 identifies the different cutting orientations and lengths of the initial cracks (a) of the twelve\nspecimens tested. As can be observed in the same table, two different imaging techniques were used in\nthe tests, namely High-Speed video and High-Resolution camera; this will be described in detail in\nSubsection 2.4 - Test Setup.\nTable 1 - Cutting orientations, initial crack lengths and image monitoring used in the specimens tested in three-point bending\n\nSpecimen\nS (in)\nW(in)\nB(in)\nOrientation\nof specimen\na (in)\nHigh-Speed\nVideo\nHigh-Resolution\nCamera\nUsed\nUsed\nUsed\nUsed\nUsed\nUsed but images\nnot available\nUsed\nUsed\nUsed\n0.5\n0.25\n0.5\n0.25\nCourtesy of Elsevier, Inc., http://www.sciencedirect.com. Used with permission.\n\n2.3\nRelative Density Measurement\nThe relative densities of the specimens were calculated based on the expression:\nRD= ρ∗\nρS\n\nWhere * is the apparent density and S is the density of the solid part of the specimen. The apparent\ndensity was determined by measuring the weight and the volume of the specimens, as presented in\nAppendix 7.1 - Specimens and cracks dimensions. The density of the solid part was measured based on a\nmodified version of the ASTM 854 - 14, which is commonly used to determine the specific gravity of\nsoil solids. Based on this ASTM standard, the density in kg/m3 of the solid fraction of the specimen is\ngiven by:\nρS=\nρW. WS\nWS+ WPW-WPS\n\nWhere\n-\nW is the density of the water, which depends on the temperature of the water used in each\nspecimen (kg/m3);\n-\nWS is the weight of the specimen, measured in a scale (kg);\n-\nWPW is the weight of the pycnometer full of water only (kg);\n-\nWPS is the weight of the pycnometer with water and specimen inside (kg).\nIn order to obtain precise values of S, the following procedure was used to measure WPW and WPS (WS is\nsimply the weight of the specimen):\n1- Water is poured into a glass flask (called pycnometer for the purpose of this experiment) to\napproximately 4/5 of its volume;\n2- The pycnometer is put inside a pressurizing vessel, as shown in Figure 6a, where a vacuum\npressure of approximately 0.4 psi (the atmospheric pressure is 1.0 bar or 14.7 psi) is applied in\norder to remove air bubbles of the water;\n3- The pycnometer is then overfilled with water taking advantage of the convex surface that the\nwater produces when a container is slightly overfilled, and subsequently carefully covered with a\nflat piece of glass (Figure 6b), making sure no air bubbles result of this process. The water that\nspills when the pycnometer is covered is cleaned with paper tissue and WPW is then measured;\n4- Some of the water inside of the pycnometer (approximately 1⁄4 of the volume) is thrown away and\nthe specimen is put inside of the pycnometer, making sure that it is completely immersed;\n\n5- The pycnometer is then taken to the pressurizing vessel, as in step 2, in order to remove all the air\nbubbles from the specimen;\n6- After measuring the temperature of the water, the pycnometer is then overfilled with water and\ncovered with a piece of glass, similar to step 3, and WPS is measured. This is shown in Figure 6c.\nUsing a flat piece of glass to cover the pycnometer and making sure that there are no air bubbles produced\nwhen covering it is important in order to make sure that the volume of the systems used to measure WPW\nand WPS are exactly the same.\n\na)\nb)\nc)\nFigure 6 - a) Pressurizing vessel used to de-air the b) water and c) specimen+water inside the pycnometer which is covered by a\nflat piece of glass to assure that the volume of the system is always the same\n2.4\nTest setup\nThe test setup consists of an Instron loading machine where a three-point bending apparatus was\nmounted, a data acquisition system that logged the vertical load applied to the specimen and the\ndisplacement of the cross-head of the loading frame at a sampling rate of 4Hz, and image monitoring\ndevices with their respective computer controls. In order to obtain clear images of the specimens, two\noptical lights were used to illuminate the specimens. The different components of the test setups are\nshown in Figures 7a and 7b.\nThe image monitoring was done with a High-Speed video (HSV) camera and with a High-Resolution\n(HR) camera. The HSV camera was set to capture three seconds before a manual trigger at 5,000 frames\nper second at a resolution of 1024 pixel x 1024 pixel, and also allowed the capturing of individual\npictures throughout the test with the same resolution. The HSV camera was triggered by the operator,\nwhen the propagation of a first crack was observed. The HR camera was used to automatically take\npictures with 24 Mpixel of resolution every two seconds throughout the entire test. Only one image\nmonitoring device was used in each test, as shown in Table 1.\n\na)\n\nb)\nFigure 7 - Test setup using a) High-Resolution camera and b) High-Speed Video camera\n\n3 Test results\nThis section describes and analyzes the load-deflection curves and imaging data obtained in the three-\npoint bending tests performed. Subsections 3.1 and 3.2 discuss the load-displacement curves obtained in\nthe tests performed in the specimens with 0.25\" and 0.50\", respectively. Within each of these subsections,\nthe results obtained with the two cutting orientations will be analyzed. Subsection 3.3 will discuss the\nrelationship between the maximum vertical load (Pmax) and the slope of the load-displacement curves in\nthe linear elastic regime, and Subsections 3.4 and 3.5 discuss the imaging data obtained with the HR and\nHSV cameras, respectively.\n3.1\nSpecimens with a = 0.25 inches ( 0.64 cm)\nBy analyzing the load vs mid-span deflection curves shown in Figures 8a and 8b, for specimens with\nOrientation 1 and 2, respectively, one can learn that:\n-\nThe maximum load reached by the two specimens with Orientation 1 was 80 N for both\nspecimens, and the slope of the curves in the linear elastic regime (before any crack develops\nsince it causes a change in the slope) is approximately 145 N/mm. This slope could be converted\ninto a modulus of elasticity in bending Ef, which for three-point bending tests without initial crack\nis given by:\nEf= S3m\n4BW3\nusing the letters shown in Figure 4 to describe the different dimensions, and with m being the\nslope of the load-displacement in the linear elastic regime. However, since a notch has to be\ncreated at the mid-span of the beam to perform fracture toughness tests, the W to be used in the\ncalculations becomes questionable; therefore, only the slope of the load-displacement curve in the\nlinear elastic regime, m, will be used in these analyses.\n-\nThe maximum load reached by the four specimens with Orientation 2 ranged between 50 N and\n105 N and the slope of the curves in the linear elastic regime is approximately 205 N/mm for the\ntwo specimens with the highest maximum load and decreases to approximately 150 N/mm and\n125 N/mm for the two specimens that reached the lowest maximum loads (Specimens 11 and 12);\n-\nThere are usually two significant load drops during the tests for both orientations tested. For the\nspecimens with Orientation 1 these drops occur at a deflection of 0.7mm to 0.8mm and at 0.9mm\nto 1.0mm. For the specimens with Orientation 2 these two drops occur at a deflection of 0.4mm to\n0.6mm and 0.7mm to 1.1mm, showing more variation than in the specimens with Orientation 1. It\n\nalso appears that the second drops observed in the specimens with Orientation 2 are more\nsignificant than those observed in the specimens with Orientation 1.\nThe load drops correspond to fractures propagating from the tip of the notch, as will be discussed in\ngreater detail in the Subsections 3.4 and 3.5, in which the imaging results will be shown. However, these\nfractures do not propagate at once until the specimen fails; they are actually arrested after the first load\ndrop and, in some tests, the specimen can be further loaded, as observed in Specimens 9, 10, 11 and 12.\nAs the test continues, the specimens continue to deform and the stress concentration at the tips of the\nalready developed cracks continue to increase until the crack further propagates. Therefore, the crack\npropagates in stages, causing a load drop every time it propagates.\n\na)\n\nb)\nFigure 8 - Load versus mid-span deflection for the specimens with initial notch length of 0.25\" for a) cutting orientation 1 and b)\ncutting orientation 2\n\n3.2\nSpecimens with a = 0.50 inches (1.27 cm)\nBy analyzing the load vs mid-span deflection curves shown in Figures 9a and 9b, for specimens with\nOrientation 1 and 2, respectively, one can observe that:\n-\nThe maximum load reached by the two specimens with Orientation 1 ranged from 50 N to 70 N,\nand the slope of the curves in the elastic regime ranged between 75 N/mm and 120 N/mm.\n-\nThe maximum load reached by the four specimens with Orientation 2 ranged between 30 N and\n50 N and the slope of the curves in the elastic regime ranged from 50 N/mm to 120 N/mm;\n-\nThere is one significant load drop during the tests performed in the specimens with Orientation 1,\nwhich occurred at a deflection slightly above 0.8mm.\n-\nThe number of significant load drops in the specimens with Orientation 2 was variable, ranging\nfrom one in Specimen 6 to three in Specimen 8.\nBy comparing the results obtained with the two initial crack lengths, the maximum loads are, as expected,\nalways greater when a=0.25\" than when a=0.50\" for the same cutting orientations. The mid-span\ndeflection at which the first load-drop is very similar for all the specimens with Orientation 1 regardless\nthe length of the initial crack, occurring at approximately 0.80mm. For Orientation 2, this first drop varied\nsubstantially, ranging from 0.40mm to 0.60mm for Orientation 1 and from 0.60mm to 0.80mm for\nOrientation 2. Furthermore, there appears to be a relationship between the maximum load reached by the\nspecimens (Pmax) and the slope of the load-displacement curve in the linear elastic regime; this\nrelationship will be discussed in the following Subsection 3.3.\n\na)\n\nb)\nFigure 9 - Load versus mid-span deflection for the specimens with initial notch length of 0.50\" for a) cutting orientation 1 and b)\ncutting orientation 2\n\n3.3\nMaximum load vs slope of the load-deflection curves in the linear elastic regime\nAs mentioned earlier, there appears to be a relationship between the maximum vertical load reached in the\ntests and the slope of the load-displacement curve in the linear elastic regime, as shown in Figure 10 for\nthe 12 specimens tested. The plot confirms that there is a strong relationship, since the data shows a high\n(0.89) coefficient of determination R2 obtained for a linear regression. Furthermore, this strong\nrelationship is obtained using all specimens tested, regardless the length of the notch or cutting\norientation.\n\nFigure 10 - Maximum load vs inclination of the load-displacement curve in the elastic regime\n3.4\nHigh-Resolution Camera observations\nThis subsection analyzes HR pictures obtained in the test performed in Specimen 4. Appendix 7.3 -\nImage Analysis - presents more imaging data and analysis of the other tests.\nIn the imaging analysis of Specimen 4, four frames were used, as shown in Figure 11a. Frame 0 was taken\nat the beginning of the test and Frame 1 was taken slightly before the first crack was visible. The change\nin slope than can be observed at approximately 0.40mm of mid-span deflection must have occurred due to\ncracks that are not visible in these HR pictures. Frame 2 was taken after a first small load drop and just\nbefore the largest load drop of the test, while Frame 3 was taken just after the same load drop.\nBy analyzing Figure 11b, one can observe that (1) as it propagates, the crack follows the direction of the\nradial trabeculae and (2) the crack starts at the notch tip and propagates by increments, causing the load to\ndrop. In Figures 11c and 11d, one can observe in more detail some of the mechanisms involved in the\npropagation of the crack in this trabecular bone: the crack intersects trabeculae which are usually\nperpendicular to its direction of propagation, and the intersected trabeculae appear to break in tension and\nonly at a single location in each trabecula. Usually, the cracks propagate without branching, as can be\nseen in Appendix 7.3; however, Frame 3 in Figure 11b shows a short branch at the top end of the crack.\n\na)\n\nb)\n\nc)\n\nd)\nFigure 11 - a) Load -displacement curve for Specimen 4, showing Frames 1 to 4 used in the analysis, b) Frames 0 to 3 showing\nthe staged propagation of a crack from the notch tip, c) close up of Frames 1 and 2 and d) close up of Frames 2 and 3 showing\npunctual fractures in the trabecula which occur as the main crack that initiated at the notch tip propagates\n\n3.5\nHigh-Speed Video camera observations\nThe HSV camera was used to capture three seconds of video at 5,000 frames per second when a first\nvisible crack of the test was observed. Figures 12a and 12b show the image analysis performed for\nSpecimen 10 using three of the frames captured: one at the start of the test, another at the initiation of the\nfist propagated crack and finally when the crack is arrested i.e. stops propagating. It can be observed that\nthe crack initiated at the tip of the notch and propagated between Frame -2850 and Frame -2846, as the\nload dropped. Since the crack propagated in four frames and the length of the propagated crack measured\nfrom Figure 12b is approximately 8mm, one can estimate that the crack propagated at a speed of\n(0.008m.5,000fps)/4frames = 10m/s. The other tests imaged with the HSV camera show that the duration\nof crack propagation ranged between two and seven frames which, taking into account the length of the\nrespective propagated cracks, correspond to a speed of crack propagation that varies between 4.0 m/s and\n11.0m/s. In this test and in those shown in Appendix 7.3, the cracks appear to propagate in tension, as\nthey open without any visible sliding, as expected for Mode I loading.\n\na)\nb)\nFigure 12 - a) Load -displacement curve for Specimen 10, showing the frames used in the b) HSV image analysis\n\n4 Relative density and fracture toughness of the specimens\nSeveral authors, such as Gibson (1985), Rice et al. (1988) and Ford and Keaveny (1996) studied the\nmechanical behavior of trabecular bone and found that its Elastic Modulus, strength and fracture\ntoughness strongly depend on its relative density, similar to what is observed in other cellular solids. In\nthis Section, the fracture toughnesses and the relative densities of the specimens tested will be analyzed\nand related to each other.\nThe fracture toughness for the three-point bending tests performed in this project was calculated based on\nthe ASTM E-1290-08 standard:\nKI= 4Pmax\nB\n√π\nW[1.6 ( a\nW)\n1 2\n⁄\n-2.6 ( a\nW)\n3 2\n⁄\n+ 12.3 ( a\nW)\n5 2\n⁄\n-21.2 ( a\nW)\n7 2\n⁄\n+ 21.8 ( a\nW)\n9 2\n⁄\n]\nas well as using Bower equation:\nKI= 6Pmax\nBWa\n1 2\n⁄ Y\nwith\nY=\n1.99 -aW\n⁄\n(1 -aW\n⁄\n) (2.15 -3.93 aW\n⁄\n+ 2.7(aW\n⁄\n)\n2)\n(1 + 2 aW\n⁄\n)(1 -aW\n⁄\n)\n3 2\n⁄\n\nIn these equations, Pmax is the maximum vertical load reached in the three-point bending tests, and the\nletters a, B and W are defined in Figure 4. As shown in Figures 13a and 13b, the fracture toughness of the\nspecimens varied between 203 kN/m3/2 and 395 kN/m3/2 with an average of 284 kN/m3/2 for Orientation 1\n(in the same plane as the radial trabeculae, as defined in Figure 5), and between 168 kN/m3/2and 319\nkN/m3/2 with an average of 225 kN/m3/2 for Orientation 2 (parallel to the axis of the vertebra, as defined in\nFigure 5). The calculation of the fracture toughnesses is shown in Appendix 7.2 - Relative Density and\nFracture Toughness Calculation.\nThe relative density of the specimens was measured using the methodology explained in Subsection 2.3 -\nRelative Density Measurement - and their values are shown in Appendix 7.2 for the 12 specimens tested.\nThe relative density of the specimens varies between 21.6% and 26.9% with an average of 24.5% for\nOrientation 1, and between 19.6% and 22.9% with an average of 21% for Orientation 2. These values are\ncomparable with the relative density of human trabecular bone, which vary between 20% and 25% for a\nhealthy young adult. As shown in Appendix 7.2, the average density of the solid part of the whale\n\ntrabecular bone (S) for the 12 specimens was 2054 kg/m3, very similar to the value of 2060 kg/m3\nreported by Gibson and Ashby (1988) - Table 11.1 - for cow bone.\nBy looking at Figures 13a and b, one can also notice that the fracture toughness of the bone appears to\nincrease from the outside to the center of the trabecular bone for both cutting directions. In fact, the\nfracture toughness reaches their maxima near the focal point of the radial trabecula (refer to Figure 5) for\nboth orientations tested.\nFurthermore, there appears to be a reasonable correlation between the fracture toughness and the relative\ndensity of the specimens, as shown in Figure 14. This is theoretically expected, even though the R2 value\nobtained was relatively low (0.66). This is very likely due to the fact that the relative density is measured\nfor a 4\"-long beam, while the fracture only develops at the mid-span of the specimens. A higher\ncorrelation would be expected if smaller specimens are used, so that there is not much material far away\nfrom the developing fracture. For this project, using large specimens had the advantage of (1) allowing\none to take clear unobstructed pictures with different cameras and (2) being relatively simple to prepare.\na)\nb)\nFigure 13 - Relative densities and fracture toughnesses for specimens with a) Orientation 1 and b) Orientation 2. The blue circles\nrepresents the focal point of the radial trabeculae, as also defined in Figure 5.\n\nFigure 14 -Relation between relative density and fracture toughness for the specimens tested\n5 Summary and Conclusions\nFrom the analyses of the results obtained from three-point bending tests performed in 12 specimens of\nwhale trabecular bone it was found that:\n-\nThere is a strong correlation between the maximum vertical load reached by the specimens and\nthe slope of the load-displacement curve in the linear elastic regime;\n-\nThe fractures initiate at the notch tip and propagate without branching and by stages, causing a\nload drop every time they propagate;\n-\nFor Orientation 1, in which fractures propagate in the same plane as the radial trabeculae, the\npropagated crack follows the direction of the radial trabeculae.\n-\nThe relative densities of the specimens vary from 19.6% to 26.9%. These densities are\ncomparable to human trabecular bone;\n-\nThe average absolute density of the solid part of the trabecular bone (S) is 2,054 kg/m3, similar\nto cow bone;\n-\nThe average relative densities of the specimens with Orientation 1 (same plane as the radial\ntrabeculae) and Orientation 2 (parallel to the axis of the vertebra) are 24.5% and 21.0%,\nrespectively. Therefore, it appears that the specimens with Orientation 1 are denser than those\nwith Orientation 2;\n-\nThe fracture toughnesses are also higher in the specimens with Orientation 1 (KIAvg = 284\nkN/m3/2) than with Orientation 2 (KIAvg =225 kN/m3/2);\n\n-\nFor both specimen orientations, it appears that the fracture toughnesses increase from the outside\nto the focal point of the radial trabeculae.\nIn conclusion, this project enhanced the knowledge of the fracturing processes in trabecular bone subject\nto Mode I loading, not only by relating load-displacement curves with what actually occurs in the\nspecimen via High-Resolution and High-Speed Video images but also by establishing relationships\nbetween the maximum vertical load and the slope of the load-displacement curves in the linear elastic\nregime and between the fracture toughnesses and relative densities of the specimens.\n6 References\nASTM 854 - 14 (2014) Standard test methods for specific gravity of soil solids by water Pycnometer.\nAmerican Society for Testing and Materials, Philadelphia, PA, USA\nASTM E-1820 (2001) Standard test method for measurement of fracture toughness.

Its properties depend on the direction\nof loading of its cells - whether radially, tangentially, or axially - and such anisotropy is\nmodeled well as a regular honeycomb structure. With the development of rapid\nprototyping technologies using materials that resist rot, it is advantageous to investigate\nthe ability of a 3D printed honeycomb to model the mechanical properties of wood.\n\nOpen-cell, hexagonal honeycomb structures with densities spaning those of hardwoods\nwere fabricated using acrylonitrile butadiene styrene. The mechanical properties of the\nhoneycombs were compared to those reported for each of the woods to ultimately assess\nthe quality of the mimicking. Specimens for each relative density were printed and\ncompressed by loading along the out-of-plane axis (axial) as well as the in-plane axis\n(transverse).\nWhile the printed honeycombs proved to be less stiff than the reported values for wood,\nthe trends in the relative densities agree with the models. This study is novel, as it uses a\n3D printer to mimic the wood structure and thus develops important insight into\nmimicking the natural material with a thermoplastic. Additionally, this work explores the\nuse honeycomb models at high relative densities similar to wood.\n\nI. Introduction\n1.1 Background\n1.1.1 Wood\n\nWood is a ubiquitous construction material, utilized in different product forms for\nmyriad purposes, from furniture and bridges, to musical instruments and baseball bats\n[1,2]. The wood structure is orthotropic and cellular, and the material has remarkably\ndifferent properties depending whether it is loaded radially, tangentially, or axially. The\ngreatest anisotropy of wood is evident in comparing the properties when loaded along\n(axially) or across the grain (tangentially). The anisotropy is comparable to that seen in\nopen-cell honeycombs where a honeycomb's in-plane (axial) properties differ from those\nout-of-plane (transverse). Similarly, the majority of wood is made up of long cells, so\nwhile it may be considered a closed-cell honeycomb, the end caps contribute little to the\nstructural properties of the wood [3].\n\nMore detail regarding the wood structure is necessary to understand its unique\nmechanical attributes. At the molecular level, wood is composed of semi-crystalline\ncellulose, amorphous hemicellulose and lignin [4,5]. The cell walls, which make up the\nsolid portion of the wood, are multilayered and consist of cellulose micro-fibrils\nembedded in a lignin-hemicellulose matrix [5]. The composition of the solid cell wall of\nwood varies little among different species such that its physical properties are assumed to\nbe constant [3,6]. Thus, the differences from species to species are principally governed\nby the cellular structure.\n\nThe taxonomic differences that divide wood into two categories, softwoods and\nhardwoods, are also reflected in their cellular structures [1,2,7,8]. Softwoods are more\nhomogenous than hardwoods, and the vast majority of their structure (90-95% by\n\nvolume) consists of long, fiber-like cells called tracheids, which provide both support and\nnutrient and water conduction [2,3,7]. The majority of the remaining tissue is made up\nray cells, most of which are radially oriented parenchyma cells [2,7]. This relatively\nhomogenous structure is commonly considered to resemble that of a honeycomb [3,6].\nSoftwood material (at 12% moisture content) has a Young's modulus that ranges from\nabout 7 to 14 GPa, a compressive strength that ranges from about 20 to 50 MPa, and a\ndensity that ranges from 300 kg/m3 to 600 kg/m3 [1].\n\nThe structure of hardwoods, however, is more heterogeneous [1-3,7,9]. Rays and\ntracheids constitute some of the tissue [2], though the long, thick-walled fiber cells,\nwhich constitute 37-70% of the wood by volume, provide most the mechanical support\n[3,7]. Wide, low-density cells, known as vessels provide fluid and nutrient conduction\nand are the third major element of hardwood tissue. They generally constitute at least\n10% of the tissue of hardwoods [2,3,7]. This varied structure gives hardwoods a broader\nrange of density and mechanical properties. Two tropical hardwoods provide bounds for\nthe density range: low density balsa at 120 kg/m3 and lignum vitae at 1200 kg/m3 [2]. The\ndensity range of most North American hardwoods is from 600 kg/m3 to 800 kg/m3 [1].\nAssuming a solid cell wall density of 1500 kg/m3 for wood [10,11], the majority of\nhardwoods fall well above the cellular solid range of relative densities, and would\ntechnically be labelled porous solids [3]. The wall thickness to edge length ratio of the\nfibers is greater than this range in most cases as well, since the vessels reduce the overall\ndensity. In addition, the honeycomb-like structure becomes more of an approximation\ndue to the different cell types.\n\nDespite the high density and complicated structure of hardwoods, their structure\nand properties are still effectively modeled using honeycombs [3,6]. The equations for\nmodelling of wood with this method are summarized in Table 1.\nTable 1. Modeling Properties of Wood [3]\nTransverse properties (In-plane)\nAxial properties (Out-of-plane)\n\n(\n\n)\n\n(\n\n)\n\n(\n\n)\n\n(\n\n)\n\nHardwoods' axial properties as a function of density are proportional to density, and the\ntransverse properties show good correspondence with in-plane honeycomb density\ndependences. Modelling wood with this approach does not assume or attempt to identify\nconstants of proportionality, unless solid cell wall properties are identified or assumed.\n\nDue to wood's high performance (high strength and stiffness at low density), a\ngreat deal of work has been performed to emulate the wood structure with ceramics,\nthrough biotemplating [12]. Additionally to combine the sustainability and mechanical\nproperties of wood with the processability of thermoplastics, wood-plastic composites are\ngaining ground in industry [13]. The work described in this report, provides an interesting\ncombination of these ideas, trying to mimic the wood structure with plastics alone.\n1.1.2 Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS)\nABS is a common terpolymer that is sold in the largest volume of all engineering\nthermoplastics worldwide. This popular material is used for applications in automotive\nparts, refrigerator linings, medical equipment, and pipes and fittings[14]. In regards to its\nmolecular composition, ABS consists of discrete, cross-linked polybutadiene (PB) rubber\nparticles, which are grafted with poly(styrene-co-acrylonitrile) (SAN) and then embedded\nin a SAN matrix [14]. This microscale structure results in a macroscale thermoplastic that\n\nis pliable at a given temperature and solidifies upon cooling, due to the intermolecular\ninteractions of the crosslinks. It is commonly sold as pellets and then molded for the\ndesired application.\nThe exact composition of the ABS is tunable given that the crosslink density and\nlatex particle size can be altered during production, and thus its range of physical and\nmechanical properties reflect the nature of its chemical composition. Its properties\ndepend on the two phases: a hard, transparent and brittle thermoplastic (SAN), and an\nelastomeric phase containing the crosslinked PB. The commercially available injection-\ngrade polymer, used for 3D printing and extrusion applications have rubber loadings of\n15-20% and S/AN ratios in the SAN of 75/25 with completely grafted particles [14].\nTypically, ABS has densities between 1.05 and 1.07g/cm3. Its physical properties are\nbetween those of rubber and glass, however, mechanically, it resembles glass more than it\ndoes rubber [14]. The elastic modulus for the two-phase system follows the simple rule of\nmixtures. Commercially available compositions have an average elastic modulus of 2.30\nGPa and a yield strength of 43.2 MPa. The average Poisson's ratio for ABS is 0.4 [14].\nThe development of rapid prototyping (RP) technologies has allowed easy\nfabrication of structures based on a computer-aided design, specifically with ABS. An\nABS filament is fed through a heating element, which heats it to a semi-molten state.\nUsing a nozzle, the 3D printer then deposits the filament onto the partially constructed\npart. Since the material is deposited at semi-molten state, the newly added filaments fuse\nwith adjacent material that has already been laid down for the structure [15].\nThe structure's mechanical properties are affected by the directionality in which\nthe filaments are deposited (Fig. 1). The directionality is determined by the orientation of\n\nthe structure in which as little supporting or fill material is required to maintain the\nintegrity of the structural design during printing, while the filaments fuse together. The\nbuild direction causes anisotropic behavior of 3D printed parts, and subsequently, the\nstrength of the material is dependent on the orientation of the filaments, to a certain\nextent [15].\nIn a previous study using three rapid prototyping processes, a specimen's\ncompressive strength was shown to depend on the direction of filament deposition (Fig.\n1). In comparing the dependence of compressive strength on directionality of ABS from a\nsimilar rapid prototyping process to 3D printing, known as fused deposition modelling\n(FDM), the FDM specimen's compressive strength was 41.26MPa, when filaments were\nparallel to the loading, which was 11.6% higher than the perpendicular loading case.\n[15]. Additionally, it is important to note that the resolution of the printer constrains the\ntarget density of the printed samples [16].\n\nFigure 1. Representation of the deposition of filaments and the corresponding variation\nin compressive strengths [15]\n\nBuilding regular, hexagonal honeycombs, requires consideration of the direction\nof filament deposition as well as the build-direction requiring the least amount of fill to\nform proper cell voids in the structure. Even with this consideration, rapid prototyping\nallows facile construction of cellular structures such as honeycombs, which have\n\nwidespread use in thermal isolation, lightweight sandwich panels, and energy absorption.\nFurther, these cellular solids are ubiquitous in nature and provide plants with\nmechanically sound structures with little weight [3].\nWith the development of 3D printing, the relative density of a honeycomb\nstructure can by adjusted by simply adjusting the input file to the 3D printing software. In\nthis manner, synthetic honeycombs mimicking biological structures can be finely tuned\nand even improved with hierarchical organizations [16]. Honeycombs printed with ABS\nhave been shown to have a relatively broad range of elastic properties and the range of\nmechanical behavior can be adjusted by tailoring the two dimension ratios and the\nstructural organization of hierarchical honeycombs [16].\nDespite the widespread study of 3D printing with ABS in recent years, there has\nbeen limited work to use this thermoplastic to model wood. Prior studies have\ninvestigated combining sawdust and ABS to create composites for adhesion mechanisms\nand improving interfacial strengths [17]. These experiments used an injection-molding\nmachine to fabricate specimens. As the content of sawdust in the mixture was increased,\nthere was a reduction in the composite strength, since the ABS tough-matrix was\ndisrupted by rigid wood sawdust particles, impairing stress transfer under load. The\nresults suggested that as the content of sawdust content increased, the moduli increased\nwith progressive decreases in the strength of the composites [17]. While the ABS-\nsawdust composite does not outperform either of the materials alone, this study\ndemonstrates the ability to improve adhesion and compatibility between polar cellulose\nfibers and hydrophobic polymers. With the success in creating ABS-sawdust composites,\nthe challenge remains to understand the potential of ABS alone to provide the mechanical\n\nintegrity that wood affords. To improve upon the application of ABS to natural\nstructures, this present study aims to assess the ability of honeycombs made of ABS to\nmodel the properties of wood.\n1.2\nObjective\nThe goal of the project was to fabricate 3 different open-cell, hexagonal\nhoneycomb structures with densities representative of the hardwood density range using\nABS, apply and assess honeycomb models to the high relative density ABS honeycombs,\nand compare the mechanical properties to those reported for hardwoods to ultimately\nassess the quality of our mimicking. In support of this objective, honeycombs of three\ndifferent densities mimicking hardwoods were loaded along the in-plane and out-of-plane\naxis to determine the compressive strength and Young's modulus to compare the\nhoneycombs to known values of wood from the literature.\n1.3\nSignificance\nABS is commonly used in investigations relating honeycomb geometries and\nmechanics, due to its high processability [18]. The widespread use of wood-plastic\ncomposites in construction indicates a growing need for a synthetic alterative to wood\nwithout sacrificing the material's natural mechanical properties and low weight [13,19].\nA synthetic alterative would also overcome the challenge of rot and degradation with\ntime and weather, increasing the life and safety of the structure. Specifically, ABS is\nresistant to chemical degradation from acidic or alkaline solutions [14]. Efforts to design\na synthetic wood structure improves the understanding of the effects of the organization\nof fibers in the different wood models.\n\nII. Methods\n2.1\nProcessing\nThe three density honeycomb templates were drawn in SolidWorks(r). The\nhoneycomb structures consisted of regular hexagons, of varying thickness to edge length\nratio (t/l), which were chosen to mimic the density of woods. This ratio, and thus the\nrelative density, was adjusted by changing the inner edge length of the hexagons and wall\nthickness. The inner edge lengths of the design from low to high density were as follows:\n3 mm, 3 mm, and 2 mm. The corresponding wall thicknesses were 0.79 mm, 2.55 mm,\nand 3.55 mm respectively. To calculate the design (t/l), the edge length, l was estimated\nas the sum of the inner edge length and wall thicknesses. The resulting design ratios then\nwere 0.208, 0.459, and 0.636, for low, medium to high density respectively. The\nhoneycomb structures were printed as blocks of 2 in (width) x 2 in (thickness) x 2 in\n(length) with a Dimension(r) bst 1200es 3D printer, using ABSPlus, a type of ABS created\nfor 3D printing. To produce specimens appropriately sized for the load cell, the blocks\nwere cut in half perpendicular to the out-of-plane axis for transverse specimens, and in\nfourths, parallel to the out-of-plane axis, for axial specimens. These provided in-plane\nspecimens of roughly 50.8 mm (width) x 25.4 mm (thickness) x 50.8 mm (length) and\nout-of-plane specimens of 25.4 mm (width) x 25.4 mm (thickness) x 50.8 mm (length).\nSee appendix for images of the specimens (Figs. A1, A2).\n2.2\nMechanical Testing\nSpecimens were compressed along their lengths for loading in both directions\nusing an Instron testing machine. A crosshead speed of 0.05 mm/s was used, and the load\nwas measured with a 45 kN load cell. Attaching an extensometer to a honeycomb was not\nfeasible for these tests and thus a measurement of displacement normalized by the body\n\nlength was used for an approximate strain measurement. The experimental properties\n(transverse Young's moduli and compressive strength) were compared with those of\nwood, and modeled based on the calculated properties and the observed deformation\nmode.\nIII. Results\nThe prepared honeycombs were relatively defect-free (see Figs. A1 & A2 for\nimages of structures), and the densities of all honeycombs of the same type (low,\nmedium, and high density) were similar. Average values of densities were 326, 538, and\n716 kg/m3. Taking a solid density of ρs = 1040 kg/m3, from the ABSPlus specification\nsheet [20], the relative densities were calculated as 0.31, 0.52, and 0.69. The actual\ndensities of honeycombs mimic those of high-density balsa, Oregon ash, and red oak,\nrespectively. The largest standard deviation in density among the three types was that of\nthe high density honeycombs, at ±7 kg/m3, giving a coefficient of variation of about 1%.\nThe densities of the tested specimens (both in- and out-of-plane specimens) is shown in\nFig. 1 with respect to the wall thickness edge length ratio, (t/l) from the Solidworks files.\nThe solid line plotted is a geometry-density relationship of equation 5, with ρs = 1040\nkg/m3.\n\nFigure 1. Density plotted against design (t/l)\n\nFour wall thicknesses were measured on one specimen of each density and averaged. An\nadditional specimen of the low density was used to take six measurements, as the design\nwall thickness and the printed thickness differed. The average wall thicknesses in mm, in\norder of increasing density were: 1.175 ± 0.063, 2.520 ± 0.022, and 3.418 ± 0.057. All\nagree with the design t (see Methods), except the low density honeycomb.\nIn-plane specimens of all densities did not show clear plateaus. Densification was\nnot observed, but specimens were not tested to strains where densification would be\nobserved, as the load dropped sharply and the maximum load was near the limit of the\nload cell. For the in-plane specimens, failure seemed to occur by plastic yielding of the\ncell walls, followed by cell wall fracture (Fig. A3 gives images of failed in-plane\nhoneycombs). Color changes in the cell walls, and deviation from non-linear behavior\nbefore failure suggested plastic yielding of the cell walls in bending. Failure in specimens\nof all densities was highly apparent at the vertices. The in-plane specimens did not show\na clear plateau. Since, the cell walls fractured, a serrated plateau would be expected.\nHowever, the load generally dropped continuously and steeply up to strains of 12%, and\n\nany serrations that were observed were over large increments of strain (e.g. Fig. A5). For\nthis reason the peak in compressive stress was taken as the strength.\nThe out-of-plane specimens did exhibit stress plateaus, but again, specimens were\nnot strained high enough for densification to be observed because of the limit of the load\ncell. The failure mode observed for the out-of-plane specimens was uniaxial plastic\nyielding, as no visible signs of failure were evident, during the beginning of the plateau,\nin most cases. The final structures did show deformation that resembled plastic buckling\n(Fig. A4). However these instabilities only formed after significant strain following the\nstress plateau. In the case of the high density honeycombs, an ABS casing was noticeably\nprinted at the boundary of the structure. During out-of-plane loading, this casing\ndelaminated from the structure, and may have resulted in lower strength values (Fig. A6\nshow this structure and its delamination). Since many of the plateaus were slightly\nnegative, the minimum between the intercept of the tangents to the elastic and plateau\nregions of the stress-strain curve and the maximum stress on the stress-strain curve was\ndefined as the out-of-plane strength.\nFig. 2 displays the out-of-plane and in-plane Young's moduli (2(a)) and\ncompressive strengths (2(b)) of the ABS honeycombs. Models described in the following\nsection are plotted as well. The properties in both directions increase with density, though\ntheir specific dependences on density are not clear from the plot, and are addressed in the\nfollowing in section 3.1.\n\n2(a) 2(b)\nFigure 2. Young's modulus and compressive strength of ABS honeycombs\n(3 = out-of-plane, 2 = in plane)\n\nThe same experimental data are shown in Fig. 3, but now on logarithmic axes.\nThe same properties of several hardwoods over the wood density range, taken from the\nmaterials selection database CES Selector(r) [21], are also plotted. Fig. 3(a) shows the\nYoung's moduli, and Fig. 3(b) plots the compressive strengths. The different density\ndependences are more clearly seen from the figure.\n\n3(a)\n\n3(b)\nFigure 3.

The curves were fitted with the MATLAB Curve Fitting Toolbox, using polynomial\nfunctions.\nTable 2.

The resulting fit was:\n\n(\n\n)\n\n(12)\nBy taking the constants of proportionality of regular hexagons, as in Table 2, and a solid\ncell wall density of ρs = 1040 kg/m3, a solid cell wall modulus of Es = 1.65 GPa was\nestimated. Similarly for the out-of-plane Young's modulus, E3\n* the fit (now linear and\nproportional, eqn 7) was\n\n(\n\n) (13)\nThis estimated a solid cell wall modulus as Es = 1.65 GPa.\n\nThe fitting of the compressive strength gave in-plane (eqn 8) and out-of-plane\n(eqn 11) fits respectively as\n\n(\n\n)\n\n(14)\n\n(\n\n) (15)\nThis fit estimated an in-plane solid cell wall yield strength of ys = 89.6 MPa, and an out-\nof-plane solid cell wall yield strength of ys = 55.6 MPa. If cell wall fracture was the\ndominate failure mechanisms in-plane, with the constant of proportionality of regular\nhexagons, the solid cell wall modulus of rupture would be fs = 134.3 MPa (eqn 9).\nThese models (eqn. 12-15) are plotted on Fig. 2. The extrapolated properties with\nthose from literature are shown below in Table 3.\nTable 3. Solid ABS Properties\n\nIn-Plane\nOut-of-\nPlane\nLiterature (measured) [14]\nEs [GPa]\n1.65\n1.65\n2.3\ns [MPa]\n89.6\n55.7\n43.2\n\nGiven the fact that there are essentially only three data points (three close clusters\nof three), linear fits of the in-plane data show good correlation (r2 ~ 0.99). Making the fits\nproportional as well as linear, severely reduces the quality of the correlation (r2 ~ 0.77).\nIn an attempt to verify the models, the data were fit to power law functions with respect\nto density, so that the exponents could be compared to those dictated by the theory. The\nexponents of the power law fit are 2.07 and 0.81 for the in and out of plane Young's\nmoduli respectively, and 2.16 and 0.85 for the in and out of plane compressive strengths.\nAll exponents, when rounded, agree with the theory, except in the case of the in-plane\nYoung's moduli. For details regarding these equations see the Appendix.\n\nIV. Discussion\n\nAll of the honeycombs had a high relative density; the lowest density that was\nmeasured was on the boundary of transition between cellular and porous solids, and the\nothers by strict definition would be porous solids. However, the aim of this study was to\nmimic wood over its vast density range, and there are hardwoods with comparable\nrelative densities. Considering a solid wood cell wall density as 1500 kg/m3, examples of\nwood corresponding to the relative densities measured in this study are bigleaf maple\n(several softwoods have this relative density), shagbark hickory, and bloodwood [1], [2].\nThe actual densities versus those expected by the simple geometric relationship\nshow discrepancies (Fig. 1). The largest disagreement occurred for the low-density\nhoneycomb. Initially this was surprising as the relationship (eqn. 5) is valid for low\ndensities. The printed wall thickness of 1.175 mm, however, was not the same as the\ndesign t, 0.79 mm. The Dimension(r) bst 1200es 3D printer either does not provide\nresolution less than a millimeter, or the printer software did not properly read the files.\nSince the measured t of the other honeycombs agreed with the design, it is likely that\nprinting of the low density honeycomb was resolution-limited. If the measured t was used\nthe estimated (t/l) becomes 0.281. This ratio predicts a density of 336 kg/m3, which\nagrees well with the measured values. The middle density honeycomb agrees well with\nthe relationship, but the relationship over predicts the density of the densest honeycombs;\nthis difference is not large or unexpected, as the relationship is meant to model low\ndensities.\n\nThese calculations of relative densities suggest that regular hexagon honeycomb\nconstants of proportionality in mechanical models are a reasonable approximation. In\ngeneral, the mechanical models match the data quite well (Fig. 2). As previously\nmentioned, several simple mathematical functions would fit the data well, which\nquestions whether the models are representative of the reality of deformation. The models\nmerit further discussion.\n\nThe fitted model for the in-plane Young's moduli had the lowest correlation\ncoefficient. The in-plane moduli for the low and middle densities were under predicted,\nwhile the high density was slightly over predicted. Additionally, it was the only property,\nfor which the exponent of the power-law fit, 2.07, did not round to the exponent dictated\nby the theory: 3. For these reasons, the model for the in-plane moduli seems the most\nproblematic. A possible explanation is that at relatively high densities (ρ*/ρs) > 0.3, initial\nelastic deformation may have enough axial compression character causing both bending\nand axial deformation, and giving an exponent of two (an average of the exponents\ncorresponding to bending (three) and axial deformation (one)). However, plasticity\nseemed to be governed by bending, as the power law exponent rounds to two.\n\nThe out-of-plane moduli model describes the data quite well. This is not\nunexpected, as the rule of mixtures forms the basis for the equation, and when the\nhoneycombs are axially loaded the initial deformation is uniaxial. The power-law\nexponent, 0.81, is less than 1, which is dictated by the theory, but does not greatly\ndisagree with the model, as was the case for the out-of-plane modulus. Both the in-plane\nand out-of-plane models use and predict the same fully dense Young's modulus, Es =\n1.65 GPa.\n\nBoth models of compressive strengths have high correlation coefficients and\ngraphical agreement with the data. Exponents from the power-law fits - 2.16 and 0.85 for\nin plane and out of plane, respectively - agree with the theory. Thus, the strength models\nsufficiently represent the data.\nThe mode of failure, however, is still questionable. All of the honeycombs were\ntoo dense for the cell walls to have elastically buckled in either direction. For the in-plane\nloading, it is possible that the mode of failure was cell wall fracture. However, color\nchange in the cell walls and nonlinear deviation on the stress-strain curve suggests that\nthere was yielding prior to cell wall fracture. Additionally, this failure behavior has the\nsame density dependence as yielding, so the fitted model would not change. The value of\nthe estimated solid cell wall property changes to the solid cell wall modulus of rupture at\n134.3 MPa (using regular hexagon constants, eqn 9). This value is quite high for ABS\nand most engineering plastics [21] and seems to be an indication that plastic yielding\ngoverned failure, although it is possible that the constant of proportionality for cell wall\nfracture of regular hexagons is incorrect at these high densities. The out-of-plane failure,\nwhich was observed as uniaxial yielding, is quite logical considering that at these relative\ndensities the equation for plastic buckling predicts higher strength values than that of\nuniaxial yield (eqn 10).\n\nThe extrapolated Young's moduli of the solid cell wall are the same value.\nHowever, the value of 1.65 GPa falls below the range of Young's modulus of ABS (1.9\nto 3 GPa) and it is lower than that given for ABSPlus, 2.32 GPa [20,21] (see Table 3).\nTwo likely causes are: (1) the supplier of ABSPlus overstates its properties and (2)\nmeasuring the strain from the crosshead displacement lead to artificially lower values\n\nfrom edge effects. While the second seems far more likely, it is surprising that the\nestimated values are the same. The extrapolated strength properties differ, and the in-\nplane solid cell wall strength, 89.6 MPa is significantly higher than the out-of-plane value\n55.6 MPa and at the upper end of the range of compressive yield strengths [20,21]. The\ndiffering strength values may be due to the difference in the \"grain\" direction, as in both\nspecimens the layers were printed in the out-of-plane direction.\nThese models are theoretically based, and the experimental results partially\nverified the theory. High density breakdowns in the models are not directly apparent. If\nthe printed solid properties were found to be consistent with the extrapolated solid cell\nwall properties, a stronger conclusion could be stated.\nDifferences in the mechanical properties of wood and ABS honeycombs are clear\n(Fig. 3). The Young's moduli of the ABS honeycombs are lower than that of wood,\nespecially in the out-of-plane/axial case. This seems logical given the difference between\nthe solid properties of ABS and those of the crystalline cellulose, which has an\nimpressive Young's modulus on the crystalline axis, ~ 140 GPa, and is a major\nconstituent of wood and highly oriented on the axial direction [6, 11]. The compressive\nstrengths are more comparable, with the out-of-plane values lower than that of wood, and\nthe in-plane values higher. This difference in material properties accounts for the\ndifference between our mimicking ABS honeycombs and that of a honeycomb composed\nof lingo-cellulosic fibers. Further, the brittle nature of ABS gives the failure more\nfracture type character than that of wood.\nThere are other important considerations in comparing the ABS honeycombs to\nthe natural structures. Firstly, ABS is hydrophobic allowing it to resist mechanical\n\nchanges due to environmental cues whereas the hydrophilic and hygroscopic nature of\ncellulose causes problems of dispersion and moisture absorption [19]. Interfacial forces\nbetween the two materials do not agree; the intramolecular hydrogen bonding system of\ncellulose provides the natural structure with variations in flexural rigidity compared to the\nhomogenous, hydrophobic ABS. The roughness of the surfaces of wood allows\nirregularities to immediately be filled by water [19], which provides wood and cellulose\nwith greater compliance compared to the more brittle cell walls of the ABS honeycomb.\n4.1\nLimitations\nSimilarly modeling the wood structure as a honeycomb has certain limitations.\nThere are differences between the macroscopic structure of softwoods, ring-porous\nhardwoods, and diffuse-porous hardwoods that are not included in the regular honeycomb\nmodel. Further, sap channels, vessels, cell caps and knots in the biological specimen\nresult in additional anisotropic considerations not included in the honeycomb models\nABS [3]. In comparing the synthetic honeycomb to the natural structure, it is important to\nnote that the ABS honeycomb was printed by first laying down an outline of the\nstructure, which created a casing around the core material of the honeycomb and\nintroduced heterogeneity in the material properties of the honeycomb. Upon examination\nof the deformed specimens, there was clear delamination of the casing from the core of\nthe honeycomb. While ABS is advantageous since it resists rot, cellulose composites\nhave many advantages compared to traditional inorganic ones: they come from a\nrenewable and abundant resource, are less damaging to the environment, are recyclable\nand biodegradable and most importantly, they combine relatively low cost with favorable\nmechanical properties [19].\n\nV. Conclusion\n\nThe study of ABS honeycombs provides two important insights. Firstly, at high\nrelative densities, honeycomb models developed for relative densities less than 0.3 seem\nappropriate for ABS; the relationship between density and (t/l) (eqn. 5) for low-density,\nregular hexagonal honeycombs relates the two parameters well at high relative densities.\nFurther, mechanical data are described well by functions with density dependences based\non theory. These conclusions provide support for the modelling of wood as a honeycomb\nover its full density range, despite its high relative densities. Secondly, obtaining a high\nstiffness with the low weight of wood using synthetic materials is difficult. Though, in\nthis study, ABS was the only material tested, and no attempts were made to add high\nperformance fiber reinforcement. It is hypothesized that while adding reinforcement\nwould allow the possibility of reaching similar performance as wood, processing would\nbecome difficult and complex quickly, specifically with fiber alignment. Taken together,\nthis study successfully outlined the success and the challenges associated with modeling\nwood structures with 3D printed honeycombs.\n\nVI.

From plant parenchyma to trabecular\nbone, the characteristic structure of cellular materials makes them ideal for various\napplications. In our research, we came across many instances in which cellular solids\nwere key to the functionality and efficiency of a structure. However, a topic that\nespecially caught our attention was the incorporation of honeycomb structure in the skull\nof the Asian elephant. Our investigation analyzes the acoustic structure and function of an\nAsian elephant skull and compares it to that of another mammalian skull that lacks\nprominent cranial honeycomb bone structure.\n\nWe hypothesized that the honeycomb architecture of the elephant cranium would result in\ngreater sound amplification as compared to a skull without this structure. Our objective\nis investigate or establish a correlation between the presence of cranial honeycomb bone\nand a sensitivity to any specific acoustic frequency.\n\nBackground\n\nElephants are capable of producing and detecting infrasound. The cranium of the\nAsian elephant (Elephas maximus) is composed of cavities that come together to form a\nhoneycomb-like structure. This unique geometry provides the skull with superior out-of-\nplane compressive and shear properties, and greatly expands the animal's acoustic\nabilities. Their large cranial resonating chambers allow them to create and receive low-\nfrequency sound waves, and to produce harmonics over a 10.5 octave range (as compared\nto 1-2 octaves in humans). The structure of the elephant skull also allows the tympanic\nmembrane, which is involved in hearing, to have larger surface area. This helps elephants\nto distinguish low frequency sounds from background noise. The honeycomb structure of\nthe elephant cranium is believed to contribute to this process and to amplify the low\nfrequency sound waves such that emitted infrasound signals can propagate through a\nfarther distance and allow communication with other members of the clan. This method\nof communication allows elephants to recognize the approach of potential predators and\nto communicate this information with members of their clan without attracting other\nanimals. Female elephants also use infrasound to communicate when they are receptive\nto mating - a selective phenomenon which occurs for only a few days every 3-4 years.\nSuch features make the honeycomb model an ideal structure for the elephant skull, and an\nintriguing topic for interdisciplinary materials science research.\n\nResearch that uses materials science methods to analyze the properties of elephant skulls\nis currently rare. Comparative zoologists have qualitatively profiled the design and bone\n\nconfiguration of the animals' cranium, and there are several existing resources that\ntentatively describe the acoustic properties of the Elephas maximus skull. However, no\npapers performing a comparative analysis between acoustic abilities of mammalian or\nfish skulls on the basis of honeycomb bone structure have been published (to our\nknowledge). We feel that this gap represents a significant intersection between the fields\nof structural materials science and zoology that has not yet been explored. This paper will\nsolve this problem by presenting a novel approach to analyzing the acoustic abilities of\nanimals using a 3D printed model of their respective skulls.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nVisit to Harvard Museum of Comparative Zoology\n\nPrior to experimentation, our project began with a visit to the Harvard Museum of\nComparative Zoology to investigate Elephas maximus skulls in the museum's collection.\nProfessor Gibson and Nina examined and photographed several adult Asian elephant\nskulls, taking note of the unique honeycomb bone structure within. The animal's cranium\nshowed especially prominent interior cavities in the rear and forehead, the latter of which\nis especially consistent with infrasound reception. Figure 1 shows a full adult Elephas\nmaximus skull from the museum collection, and a closer view of the honeycombs.\n\nFigure 1: An adult Elephas maximus skull from the Harvard MCZ's collection, and a\nclose-up of honeycomb bone structure behind the eye socket.\n\nConstruction of 3D Skull Models\n\nIn order to analyze the acoustic properties of the Elephas maximus skull, we retrieved a\nCT scan of an Asian elephant cranium through Digimorph. Digimorph is an NSF-funded\ndigital library based at the University of Texas, Austin, and features models of mammal,\nfish, reptile, and dinosaur skulls courtesy of the UT Texas High-Resolution X-ray CT\nFacility. This specimen was scanned at the Heart Hospital of Austin using an Imatron C-\n150 XP/LP \"ultra-fast\" CT. In order to compare the elephant's honeycomb bone\nstructure with a hollower cranium, a model of a bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus)\nskull was also downloaded from Digimorph. Both models were recovered from juvenile\nmale animals, and were scaled by 0.5 in order to fit the dimensions of our laboratory\nequipment. Figure 2 depicts slices of the elephant and dolphin skull scans, clearly\nshowing the honeycomb structure present in the Elephas maximus skull and the hollow\n(minimal honeycomb) configuration of the Tursiops truncates cranium.\n\nFigure 2: Slices of CT scans of the Asian elephant and bottlenose dolphin skull scans,\ndemonstrating a stark contrast between honeycomb and hollow bone structure\n(respectively).\n\nPhoto removed due to copyright restrictions.

After printing, the models were\ncleaned using a small paintbrush and a pen-sized air jet, and subsequently infused with\nwax to reduce brittleness; Figure 3 presents a glimpse of the manufacturing process for\nboth skulls. While the Tursiops truncates skull was printed in full (minus the jaw and\nteeth), the Elephas maximus skull was printed in three layered pieces to reduce the risk of\ncollapse from the weight of excess powder inside.\n\nFigure 3: An Elephas maximus cross-section being rendered in the 3D printer, and the\nTursiops truncatus skull being waxed during post-processing.\n\nAcoustic Equipment and Testing\n\nTwo skull models were subjected to acoustic testing in order to determine whether a\nlarger cranial honeycomb bone structure allows an animal to amplify sound waves better\n\nthan a more common sandwich bone structure. The bottlenose dolphin skull (selected\nbecause it contains no honeycomb structure) was compared to a three-layered Asian\nelephant skull model. The delicate nature of the powder models, even in post-processing,\ndiscouraged us from printing and testing an elephant skull printed as a single piece;\ninstead, thick cross-sections were securely bound together to simulate a full skull.\n\nThe elephant skull was bound using a rigging system devised of standard rubber bands;\nthis material ensured that the model would be permitted to shift and flex while retaining a\nsecure fit. A powered hand drill was used to attach a PCB Piezoelectronics ICP\n(integrated circuit piezoelectric) accelerometer to the interior of each subject, located on\nthe upper left \"forehead.\" Both the accelerometer and a large audiovisual amplifier were\nwired to a SR760 single-channel spectrum analyzer. This machine was connected to a\nlaptop running LabView 2010 software, as shown in Figure 4. A custom program to\nacquire and save acoustic data from the spectrum analyzer was designed using\nLabView's software architecture. This experimental setup permitted us to adjust the\nproperties of the sound input (e.g. volume, auto-scale, frequency averaging) before the\ndata was saved.\n\nBoth skulls were suspended in turn from a fixed point using a second rubber band\nrigging; the net-like structure supported each model in an upright position precisely 23\ninches from the laboratory countertop. The amplifier was placed on top of the counter, 43\ninches from the skull.\n\nFigure 4: The experimental setup, with a close-up of the accelerometer's position inside\nthe two-part elephant skull.\n\nWhite noise was projected toward the skulls by the amplifier, set at the unit's maximum\nvolume level. The received frequencies were auto-ranged and -scaled by the spectrum\nanalyzer, and the LabView software recorded an average of the resulting waves.\n\nResults and Discussion\n\nFigure 5 displays the data recovered from the application of white noise to the dolphin\nand elephant skulls; the frequency of sound waves is examined against the decibel level\nrecorded by the accelerometer to provide an estimation of the tones perceived by the\nanimals. Decibels are measured on a logarithmic scale, with negative numbers indicating\nsound waves with low amplitude. This measurement is a common feature in analyses of\nhearing ability or hearing loss.\n\nFigure 5: This chart presents the frequencies recorded by the accelerometer in each skull\nmodel.\n\nThis data suggests that the elephant skull can receive and perceive low frequency sounds\nmore successfully than the dolphin model. As frequency increases past 20 kHz, the\nelephant skull's sensitivity to sound (measured in decibels) decreases steadily, while the\ndolphin skull shows a near-proportional increase. This result is consistent with\nphysiological hearing capabilities of both animals. Bottlenose dolphins have a superior\nhearing range, particularly in the ultrasound region, and can perceive sound from 0.2-150\nkHz. Asian elephants, in comparison, are more adept in recognizing infrasound, and\ndisplay acoustic sensitivity between 0.016-12 kHz.\n\nThe prevalence of thick honeycomb bone structure in the Elephas maximus' cranium and\nthe animal's sensitivity to infrasound waves suggests that the species uses bone\nconduction to hear low-frequency sound. Our results indicate that the Asian elephant can\ndetect these sound waves better than the bottlenose dolphin, whose skull displays no\nhoneycomb bone configuration. It is important to understand that cartilage and soft\ntissues also aid that acoustic conduction in animal skulls; however, the focus of this\nproject is upon the auditory structure and function of cranial bone architecture, and the\nabilities that this feature promotes.\n\nConclusion and Recommendations\n\nWithin the scope of this work, it is ultimately unclear whether acoustic sensitivity can be\ncompletely and reliably correlated to the amount of honeycomb bone structure present in\nan animal's cranium. Our results indicated a positive proportionality, but to\nunequivocally prove this point, it would also be necessary to test the relationship between\nthe size of an animal's skull and its capacity to receive sound. Larger skulls in animals\nrepresent sizable resonating chambers that can optimally register low frequency sound\n\nwaves. The presence of honeycomb bone chambers within a skull has been shown\nthroughout topical literature to positively contribute to these abilities.\n\nIn order to conclusively understand the relationship between the size of a skull, the\ndegree of honeycomb structure present, and the frequencies of sound that an animal\nhears, it would be necessary to fabricate additional skulls representing a variety of\nmammalian species. The experimentation methodology would be more accurate if entire\nskulls could be printed out using a larger Z-Corporation 3D printer. We were constrained\nduring this investigation by the limited amount of CT scans available on Digimorph and\nthe time and printer volume required to print; additional resources that would allow a\nmore direct comparison between cranial features of animals would permit us to interpret\nour data with greater confidence.\n\nTo continue our research project, it would be useful to investigate the skull structure and\nacoustic abilities of other animal species. Performing the same experiment on skulls of\ndifferent animals with varying sizes and degrees of honeycomb structure could provide\ninsight into how much the honeycomb structure and skull size directly affect acoustic\nproperties. Future experiments should involve testing with a wider range of frequencies,\nfocusing more (given a more specialized spectrum analyzer) on infrasound waves.\nBecause elephants are able to produce and perceive sounds with frequencies as low as 12\nHz, it would be ideal if the skulls could be subjected to targeted sound waves of\ncomparable frequencies, rather than the white noise available on our amplifier.\n\nOverall, we did tentatively prove our hypothesis that the presence of cranial honeycomb\nbone structure increases an animal's sensitivity to specific sound waves. The extensive\nhoneycomb architecture in the Elephas maximus model appears to have heightened the\nskull's detection of low-frequency sound waves, rendering the animal better able to\nperceive infrasound.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nWe would like to express our deepest gratitude to: David Bono for his generous time in\nassembling the acoustic setup with us, answering questions, and teaching us how to\ndesign the custom LabView program; Mike Tarkanian for instructing us in the use of the\n3D printer and making the equipment available to us; Dr. Judy Chupasko for her time,\nand for allowing us to closely examine Elephas maximus skulls in the Harvard MCZ\ncollection; and to Professor Lorna Gibson for giving us advice that guided the progress of\nour investigation.\n\nReferences\n\nFay, R.R. and Popper, A.N.

Introduction and Overview\nBamboo, a material of high strength-to-weight ratio, is widely applied throughout the\norld. It is applicable to many environmental and economic possibilities, including construction\nnd development. The uniqueness of its mechanical properties leads to endless potential\npplications.\nBamboo is a fiber reinforced composite with a distinct modulus gradient on the cross\nection. This is different from wood, which consists of a more homogenous cellular material. The\nollow, tough stem, or culm, of the bamboo is divided by a number of nodes and consists of\nascular bundles in a matrix of parenchyma cells. The density of these bundles increases radially\ns well as by height. The mechanical properties of the bamboo depend largely on the structural\nariation and components that make up the vascular bundles.\nThis paper will focus on the characterization of the microstructure and mechanical\nroperties of Tre Gai (bambusa stenostachya) bamboo. Flexural strength and elastic moduli will\ne tested with respect to density and radial position. The bamboo microstructure will then be\nelated to these mechanical properties in hopes of obtaining a better understanding of the\nechanical characterization of Tre Gai bamboo.\nw\na\na\ns\nh\nv\na\nv\np\nb\nr\nm\n\n2. Theoretical Background\nBamboo is widely used throughout the world, particularly amongst Asian countries where\nit is abundant. It has a large strength-to-weight ratio making it applicable to many environmental\nand economic possibilities. For example, the use of bamboo is abundant in the wood, paper, and\npulp industries today.1 It is also a means of rural development as bamboo is easily grown,\nharvested, accessible, and affordable.2 Tre Gai (bambusa stenostachya Hackel) bamboo in\nparticular is a popular, native species to Vietnam and a significant industry resource.3 This paper\nwill focus on the mechanical properties of Tre Gai bamboo in hopes of contributing to the\ncomparison between it and other commercially important species, such as that of Moso bamboo\n(phyllostachys pubescens) popular in China.\nA member of the grass family, bamboo itself is unique due to its rapidly growing woody\nstem and tall heights.2 Bamboo is modeled as a fiber-reinforced bio-composite with a distinct\nmodulus gradient on the cross section of its hollow stem, or culm. This inhomogeneity differs\nfrom wood, which exhibits a more homogenous cellular material and obtains its strength from\nthickening cell walls.4 The bamboo's culm consists of many nodes which divide the stem into a\nnumber of internodes. Depending on the height, internodes differ from each other in length, wall\nthickness, diameter, and material properties.\nThe culm wall is composed of a functional gradient of dense vascular bundles embedded\nin a matrix of parenchyma cells.1 These vascular bundles are composed of vessels and sieve tubes,\nsurrounded by sclerenchyma tissue. Sclerenchyma is composed of fibers that appear in the shape\nof cups around outer faces of vessels; however, the fiber strands take many forms in different\nculm positions and heights, as well as in varying bamboo species. Generally, there are vascular\nbundle types that exhibit distinct supporting sclerenchyma fiber sheaths, those that contain some\n\ndistinct supporting fiber sheath with one strikingly larger sheath in an intercellular space, or those\nwith two large fiber strands outside the central sheath-supporting strands.1 Inner culm regions\ntend to contain more distinct supporting fibers, while outer regions favor large fiber strands in the\nimmediate intercellular space outside vascular bundles. In the culm wall, the density of these\nvascular bundles increases towards the outer wall, or cortex, and decreases towards the inner wall,\nor pith. The density also increases gradually with height. Finally, all cells are lined axially,\nalthough this alignment may differ at the nodes. The mechanical properties of bamboo depend on\nall of the above factors.\nThe mechanical factors of interest center around the flexural strength, or modulus of\nrupture (MOR), and elastic moduli (MOE). The flexural strength is a measure of a material's\nability to resist deformation under a load. The flexural strength for a rectangular specimen under\nthree-point bending can be calculated using:\nσ = 3Pb\nwt!\nwhere P is the load at fracture, b is the span, w the width, and t the thickness of the beam. σ\nrepresents the maximum stress the specimen can withstand until rupture. Similarly, the elastic\nmoduli can be calculated using:\nmb!\n!\nwhere m is the linear slope of the flexural stre\nE\nngt\n= 4w\nh st\nt\nress-strain curve, b is the span, w the width,\nand t the thickness of the beam. Ε represents the specimen's ability to deform elastically when the\nload P is applied to it. Both flexural strength and elastic moduli are prime indicators of the\nbamboo's strength.\n\nIn this paper, the mechanical properties and microstructure of Tre Gai bamboo were\nexplored. Flexural strength and elastic moduli of samples from different internodes and radial\npositions were tested. These values were plotted with respect to density and radial position, then\nanalyzed according to a variety of filters. Following this, the bamboo microstructure was related\nto its mechanical properties and further discussed. Ultimately, the goal of characterizing this\nbamboo will be to provide a basis for understanding and comparing Tre Gai with other widely\nused species.\n\n3. Materials and Methods\nThe lower ten nodes of dried Tre Gai bamboo culm was imported from Vietnam. The\ninternode diameter, length, and thickness were all measured prior to making the final samples.\n\n3.1 Microscopy and Modeling\nCross sections of Tre Gai bamboo culm at various internodes were analyzed via\nmicroscopy. Roughly 10mm thick culm microscopy sections were cut and prepared by surface\npolishing perpendicular to the fiber axis, on grinding paper. Progressively finer grit size ranging\nfrom 800 to 4000 was used for 5-10 minutes each with deionized water, and samples were laid to\ndry for 48 hours.\nSamples from internodes 1, 5, and 9 (with 9 being the highest internode) were imaged\nusing a JOEL JSM- 6610LV Scanning Electron Microscope to show structure. Images were\nobtained in the LSEI mode at 50X magnification under 20kV and 30Pa from the inner to outer\nwalls. Full culm images were stitched using imaging software to show continuous structure to\nanalyze volume fraction of vascular bundles with respect to radial position. Image analysis was\nperformed manually on ImageJ by separating fiber regions from other culm constituents to a\nbinary-processed image, and measuring volume fraction of filled fiber bundles at radial\nincrements. SEM images of parenchyma, vascular bundles, fibers, and longitudinal sections (BEC\nmode used), containing both constituents were also obtained at higher magnifications.\n\n3.2 Flexural Strength and Elastic Moduli\nBending samples from internodes 1, 5, and 9 were created by splitting axially and radially\nalong the culm wall (Figure 3.1 left, middle). Three pieces were cut from each internode, and the\ncortex and pith of each was sanded off. Each of these were then radially cut into four more pieces\nand sanded to even out the dimensions as much as possible. A total of 36 samples were created, as\ncan be seen on the right in Figure 3.1 below. These samples had an average length of 13.3 ± 0.6\ncm, average width of 16.3 ± 1.7 cm, and thickness ranging from 0.2 - 0.6 cm. The density of each\nsample was measured, and ranged from 200 - 800 kg/m3. Beams were tested in three-point\nbending, with outer surfaces face up, speed 1 mm/min and the span-to-depth ratio no less than 20.\nFigure 3.1 Left: Tre Gai bamboo before splitting. Middle: Internodes 1, 5, and 9.\nRight: Finished samples for three-point bending.\n\n4. Results\n4.1 Macrostructure\nThe diameter of the culm\naveraged to 6.8 ± 0.1 cm, with a bell\nshaped distribution, peaking at halfway\nalong the height of the culm (Figure\n3.2, top). With respect to culm height,\nthe length of the internodes decreased\nlinearly, ranging from 26.0 cm to 20.1\ncm, while internode thickness increased\nlinearly, ranging from 13.2 ± 0.9 cm to\n18.3 ± 1.3 cm (Figure 3.2, middle,\nbottom).\n\nFigure 3.2 Internode diameter (top), length (middle),\nand thickness (bottom) with varying internode\nnumber.\n\n4.1 Microstructure\nThe structure of Tre Gai bamboo in the first internode is shown in Figure 4.1 (top),\ncharacterized by vascular bundles of consistent orientation within a parenchymal matrix. Bundles\nare larger at the inner wall and become gradually smaller and more densely packed towards the\nouter wall. Vascular bundles consist of two large vessels and a sieve tube in a triangular\narrangement, with outer faces of the bundles surrounded with sclerenchyma fiber. Parenchyma\n(Figure 4.2) surrounds the constituents of the bundle arrangement. A longitudinal section of the\nculm with sclerenchyma fibers in parenchyma is shown in Figure 4.6.\n\nFigure 4.1 Top: Tre Gai bamboo structure in cross section of the first internode.\nBottom: binary-processed image of cross section\n\nFigure 4.2 Parenchyma in the first internode.\n\nTo obtain the volume fraction of fibers, images were processed using ImageJ to separate\nthe sclerenchyma from other culm constituents, as shown for the first internode in Figure 4.1\n(bottom). Dark elements of the binary-processed image were counted to experimentally measure\nthe volume fraction of fibers. Figure 4.3 shows volume fraction of fibers as a function of\nnormalized radial position. In the first internode, volume fraction increased from approximately\n0.08 to 0.40; in the fifth internode, volume fraction increased from 0.04 to 0.42.\n\nFigure 4.3 Vascular bundle volume fraction with varying normalized radial position.\n\nImages of inner bundles (Figure 4.4, left) and outer bundles (Figure 4.4, right) were\ndocumented in the first internode, and ambiguous fiber-parenchyma regions were observed.\nWhile outer bundles contain four fibrous regions with an additional ambiguous region of\nimmature fiber, inner bundles displayed only three fibrous regions around the vessels and phloem\nwith the midpoint of the culm being the approximate boundary. A similar ambiguous region of\nmaterial is observed in inner bundles, but resembles smaller, denser parenchyma rather than fiber.\n\nIn Figure 4.5, a vascular bundle near the outer culm is shown, where the fiber regions have grown\ninto one another, and a dense parenchymal region that does not resemble mature fiber is present.\n\nFigure 4.4 First internode, inner vascular bundle (left) and outer vascular bundle (right).\nF denotes fiber and A is the ambiguous region.\n\nFigure 4.5 Vascular bundle in the outer ninth internode with two mature fiber sheaths.\nF denotes fiber and A is the ambiguous region.\n\nFigure 4.6 Longitudinal section showing parenchyma and fibers.\n\n4.2 Mechanical Strength\nOf the 36 samples prepared, 29 were successfully tested for flexural strength and elastic\nmoduli. Figure 4.7 (top) shows how the flexural strength (MOR) of the Tre Gai bamboo vary with\nsample density, while Figure 4.7 (bottom) shows how the elastic moduli (MOE) of vary with\nsample density. Both flexural strength and elastic moduli appear to follow a consistent, quadratic\ntrend with density. Separating by internode also exhibits the same consistent increase for both.\n\nFigure 4.7 Top: Flexural strength of Tre Gai bamboo with varying density.\nBottom: Elastic moduli with varying density.\n\nFigure 4.8 (top) shows the Tre Gai bamboo flexural strength as a function of radial\nposition, r, normalized by the total wall thickness, a, while Figure 4.8 (bottom) shows the elastic\nmoduli (MOE) as a function of normalized radial position. Both flexural strength and elastic\n\nmoduli appear to follow a consistent, quadratic trend with radial position. Separating by internode\nalso exhibits the same consistent increase for both.\n\nFigure 4.8 Top: Flexural strength of Tre Gai bamboo with varying normalized radial position,\nr/a. Bottom: Elastic moduli with varying normalized radial position.\n\n5. Discussion\nTre Gai bamboo exhibits generally the same characteristics as other bamboo under study.\nIn this discussion, Tre Gai bamboo will be compared to Moso bamboo, a popular and well-studied\nspecies.\nAccording to the macrostructure, with respect to height, the diameter of the Tre Gai culm\nshows a bell shaped distribution, the internode length decreases linearly, and the internode\nthickness increases linearly. In comparison, for Moso bamboo, with respect to height, the culm\ndiameter decreases linearly, the internode length increases by a power of 0.5, and the internode\nthickness decreases exponentially.5 This poses quite an interesting outcome as none of the\nparameters in the Tre Gai bamboo exhibit the same trends. The consistency of the data, however,\nsuggests that the Tre Gai may simply have fundamentally different patterns.\nMicroscopy on the first and fifth internodes indicates that the volume fraction of fibers in\nTre Gai increases with radial position in the culm up to approximately 0.4 at the outer wall,\nconsistent with trends shown in Moso bamboo. Between these two internodes, it can be inferred\nthat volume fraction of fiber also increases with height. Data for the ninth internode is not\nreported because greater culm thickness posed difficulty in image processing.\nDespite consistent trends in volume fraction values, Tre Gai showed a key difference from\nMoso in that an additional (fourth) region of sclerenchyma fiber was absent from most bundle\nclusters towards the inner wall, often showing instead a large ambiguous circular cluster of dense\nparenchyma or underdeveloped sclerenchyma fiber sheath. This region is not observed in Moso\nbamboo or addressed in other bamboo work. Only beginning after the midpoint of the culm wall\nwere additional distinct sclerenchyma sheaths apparent.\n\nFor mechanical properties, the data of elastic moduli against radial position is consistent\nwith that of Moso bamboo.6 However, Moso bamboo does appear to have a slightly higher elastic\nmoduli. Overall, though, the trends and values complement one another. An important point to\nnote is that the extrapolated trend lines for both the MOR and MOE do not cross the origin, unlike\nwhat is commonly seen for wood models. This is due to bamboo's fiber reinforced structure as\nopposed to wood's strength from thickening cell walls.\nOne qualifier for the normalized radial position must be addressed. Although the total\nculm wall thickness of each internode was measured, the wall thicknesses minus the cortex and\npith which were sanded off were not measured. Thus, the current values of radial position, r/a, are\nnormalized against the total wall thickness a, but the actual thickness measurements, r, take into\naccount the sanded off cortex and pith. As a result, the values for each normalized radial position\nmay be slightly off. However, because this is a consistent pattern for each sample, the trends\nabove may still be considered with confidence.\n\n6. Conclusion\nTre Gai bamboo is a widely used material with unique yet sound microstructure and\nmechanical properties. Microscopy has shown that Tre Gai follows similar trends for volume\nfraction of schlerancyma fiber with radial position in the culm as other bamboo species such as\nMoso. However, it is noted that Tre Gai exhibits ambiguous regions resembling dense\nparenchyma or underdeveloped fiber where Moso has an additional fibrous region. In terms of\nmechanical strength, though the trends of its internode length, diameter, and culm wall thickness\ndiffer from that of the well-studied Moso bamboo, similar trends of elastic moduli against radial\nposition are observed. This reveals the diverse structures of bamboo, which ultimately constitute\nthe same mechanical and microstructural patterns that contribute to its various potential\napplications.\n\n7. Proposed Future Work\nMuch is left to be learned about Tre Gai bamboo. Further microscopy and analysis may be\nused to better understand the constituents of the ambiguous parenchyma-fibrous regions of the\ninner Tre Gai culm. The partial fiber regions can be included in further volume fraction analysis\nto identify how they account for differences in Tre Gai mechanical property in comparison with\nbamboos that exhibit the classical bundle structure. Additional study can elaborate on the trend of\nvolume fraction sclerenchyma with Tre Gai internode number, or height.\nIn terms of mechanical strengths, flexural strength and elastic moduli may be tested in a\nradial or transverse orientation, in comparison to axial strengths. Further work may also be done\nto illustrate the compressive strengths of the Tre Gai bamboo, both axially, radially, and\ntransversely. These values may then be compared with each other as well as amongst other\nspecies like Moso bamboo or wholly different material such as wood.\nThis project provides a clear overview of Tre Gai bamboo's microstructure and\nmechanical properties. Still, much more needs to be done before it is possible to truly understand\nand compare the integrity of Tre Gai to other bamboos.\n\n8.
