  "syllabus_content": "Course Meeting Times\n\nLectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session\n\nWelcome to 6.452\n\nThis is a graduate-level introduction to the fundamentals of digital wireless communications. Our focus is on the design, the analysis, and the fundamental limits of wireless transmission systems, and to develop the foundation for research in this field. To provide the longest term value, our emphasis will be on the basic principles that apply to all such systems, rather than the details of any particular current system or standard. The subject builds naturally on 6.450 (Principles of Digital Communications - I), and complements other follow-on subjects, such as 6.451 (Principles of Digital Communications - II), 6.441 (Transmission of Information), and 6.263 (Data Networks).\n\nPrerequisites\n\nThe prerequisite is 6.450, or permission of the instructors. We rely on 6.450 to build the connection between a real-life communication channel and its digitized models, so that we can focus almost exclusively on the digital designs in the current course. We also require fluency in the main structures and concepts of digital communication systems, as well as the associated probabilistic analysis.\n\nWe expect students to have some experience in linear algebra and probability. You are recommended to review and evaluate yourself on your fluency using the following textbooks.\n\nBertsekas, Dimitri P., and John N. Tsitsiklis.\nIntroduction to Probability\n. Belmont, MA: Athena Scientific Press, June 2002. ISBN: 188652940X.\n\nStrang, Gilbert.\nLinear Algebra and Its Applications\n. 3rd ed. Pacific Grove, CA: Brooks Cole, 1998. ISBN: 0155510053.\n\nWe do not require the knowledge of information theory. Although a large portion of the course has information theoretic flavor, we will develop the necessary concepts as we encounter them. However, it is certainly helpful if you have already taken, or are currently taking, 6.441.\n\nTextbook\n\nThe required textbook is the new and very nice book,\n\nTse, David, and Pramod Viswanath.\nFundamentals of Wireless Communication\n. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2005. ISBN: 0521845270.\nOnline version\n.\n\nNote:\nI personally believe this book is one of the best technical books, and a hard copy is worth having. It is fine to go through this course with only the on-line version, for the assigned readings and problem sets. Printing out the whole book is however considered a waste of resource and strongly discouraged.\n\nTentative Topics\n\nWe expect to introduce the following topics during the term.\n\nWireless Channel Models, Noise and Interference\n\nCapacity and Outage\n\nDiversity and Space-Time Coding\n\nDiversity-Multiplexing Tradeoffs\n\nWireless Networks and Resource Management\n\nAdvanced Topics\n\nProblem Sets, Project, Quizzes\n\nThere will be 3 problem sets, one short project, and two quizzes, scheduled as follows:\n\nSES #\n\nKEY DATES\n\nProblem set 1 out\n\nProblem set 1 due\n\nProblem set 2 out\n\nQuiz 1\n\nProblem set 2 due\n\nProblem set 3 out\n\nProblem set 3 due\n\nProject out\n\nProject due\n\nQuiz 2\n\nQuiz 1 will be a take-home exam, although we expect students to finish it in around 2 hours. This is part of our effort towards time-pressure-free exams.\n\nCourse Grade\n\nThe final grade in the course is based upon our best assessment of your understanding of the material during the semester. Roughly, the weights used in grade assignments will be:\n\nACTIVITIES\n\nPERCENTAGES\n\nQuiz 1\n\n35%\n\nQuiz 2\n\n35%\n\nProject\n\n20%\n\nHomework\n\n10%\n\nHowever, other factors such as interaction with the staff and participation in lecture can make a significant difference in the final grade. In general, the process of assigning a final grade involves a lot of discussion among the staff and a careful review of the quizzes and project. Although the focus of the course is obviously learning, not grades, we know the final grade is important to you, and we want you to know that we take the process seriously.",

      "content": "Massachusetts Institute of Technology\nDepartment of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science\nPrinciples of Wireless Communication\nProject\nSpring 200 6\nIssued: Wednesday, Ses #20\nDue: Wednesday, Ses #24\nIn this project, you will be writing a review of a paper in the wireless communication area,\nas if you had received such a request for review from an associate editor of a journal. This\nprovides you an opportunity to apply your understanding of concepts developed in class, as\nwell as an opportunity to begin to learn how to prepare a useful paper review.\nIn terms of length, you should aim for a review of approximately 2-3 pages, though there\nare no strict length constraints. You are welcome to structure your review in any way that\nseems most natural or logical to you. Your review should be critical analysis and evaluation\nof the strengths and weaknesses of the work, together with specific recommendations for\nways the manuscript can be improved. Note: While the final step of a real review is to\nmake a recommendation in the form of \"accept\", \"revise\", or \"reject\", you can omit this\nstep.\nYou will choose one paper from the list we have provided in the readings section.\nEach of you will work independently and prepare an independent review, but there is no\nrequirement that you work on different papers. Choose whichever paper seems of most\ninterest to you; all are of approximately the same technical level. Also, while some of the\npapers on the list are actual preprints, some are reprints. For the purposes of this exercise,\ntreat all these papers as if they were unpublished manuscripts from the point of view of your\nreview. Note: Do not be biased by how well known the authors are or are not in preparing\nyour review!\nAs the well-known mathematician Paul Halmos once wrote, the goal of the reviewer is to\ndetermine whether the work is 1) new, 2) true, and 3) interesting. A paper should meet all\nthree criteria, so you should assess each of these aspects of the paper to the best of your\nabilities and experience. Note: you may find it useful to read portions of some related\npapers to help you in preparing your review. However, you are not being asked to do an\nextensive analysis of the background literature; your review should be principally based on\napplying what you have learned from class.\nSome questions to think about on different aspects of the manuscript when writing your\nreview:\nProblem Formulation How important is the problem being addressed to practice? What\nare the assumptions made? Are the final results sensitive to these assumptions? Can\n6.452\n\nthe main ideas and approach of the paper be applied to more general cases when some\nof the assumptions are eliminated? What are the limits of applicability?\nTechnical Development Is there an alternative way to derive these results? Are the\nresults correct? Can you come up with illustrating examples, or even better, counter\nexamples? Do the results warrant the level of mathematics used (i.e., does the end\njustify the means)? Is there an approximation that can arrive at the essentially the\nsame results more easily or with more intuition? Is there a geometric picture one can\ndevelop to better understand the results?\nExposition Are the ideas and results organized in a logical order? Is it easy or hard to\nread, and why? How could it be better laid out? Think about how would you present\nthe same results if you were to have developed them. Note: you need not to comment\non the typographic or small grammatical errors."
