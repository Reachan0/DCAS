Once repeatable ice formation was achieved, the\nvariables affecting ice screw safety were tested in the simulated ice.\nIce screws are protection devices that allow climbers to anchor themselves to ice. This\nproject was a response to the current lack of any controlled testing procedure for ice\nscrews, and the perceived margin for improvement of ice screw design and usage in the\nfield. This project is of value to the technical and the climbing community because it will\ncreate a methodology for making 'climbing ice' types in the lab and provide data on\ncurrent safety standards of ice climbing equipment. This study will reduce the failure rate\nin ice climbing by being the first step towards the improvement of such protective\nequipment, and in educating climbers about the limits of their equipment and how to\nuse that equipment most effectively.\nThe conclusion drawn from the data obtained in Stage 1 was that more research should\nbe done into how different ice types can be differentiated. The density test was the only\nstatistically significant quantitative method for describing different ice types. The main\nconclusion from Stage 2 was that raising the loading rate lowers the failure loads.\nClimbers should therefore concentrate on employing methods for reducing the loading\nrate on ice screws in the event of a fall.\nii\n\nTable of Contents\nAbstract ................................................................................................................................ii\n1.

Introduction\n1. 1 Background\nOver the past 10 years, ice climbing has grown tremendously in its popularity as a sport.\nEver since Yvon Chouinard introduced the first rigid crampons and curved ice picks in\nthe late 1960's, climbers have been refining techniques and developing equipment in\norder to push the limits of ice climbing (see Figure 1).\nIce Screw Placements\nFigure 1: Illustrating a climber on an ice face*\nFigure 2: Showing how ice screw protection works\nFigure 2 shows how the ice screw protects a climber on the ice. As a climber ascends\nthe ice face, ice screws are placed in the wall at intervals along the way. The frequency\nof placement depends on the competency and confidence of the individual climber.\n* photograph taken by Luca Marinelli, exhibited courtesy of project advisor, David Custer.\n\nThe belayer at the base of the climb pays out rope to the climber above; if the climber\nfalls, the fall will only be as far as the highest ice screw and the belayer locks off the rope\nand prevents it from paying out further, thus arresting the fall.\nOne of the current limitations on ice climbing is the strength of the interface between\nanchors that the climbers use and the ice wall. Current research into better protection is\nbased on anecdotal evidence and lacks a controlled methodology for test or\nevaluation.\nIce screws are the main protection type; thus, for the purposes of this\ninvestigation, the focus is solely on ice screws.\nIce screws are pieces of climbing safety gear that are used as anchors on a route. This\nroute can be led (when the climber places his own protection on the route) or top-roped\n(a rope anchored at the top of the climb). The climber is then attached to the screw by\na carabiner through the hanger and is thus anchored to the climbing face. Figure 3\nshows an ice screw.\nScrew\nHanger\nthreads\nFigure 3: An ice screw\nThe ice screw itself is a hollow screw that is turned into the ice by use of a 'hanger' on its\nend. The screw first 'bites' the ice with a set of sharp, beveled teeth; as it is turned, the\nice is forced out through the center of the hollow screw. In order to reduce friction, both\nthe inside surface and outside threaded surface of the screw are machined to be\n\nsmooth. The screw is usually in the range of 10-22 cm long and has a diameter in the\nrange of 15-17 mm. The hanger is typically around 8 cm long. Screws can be made\nfrom steel or titanium.\nIce screws provide effective anchoring if placed properly, but, like all protection devices,\nare subject to the changeable nature of the ice environment. Proper placement is\ndefined as placing the screw in good ice and at an orientation that allows the loading to\nbe held by the screw threads so the load path runs the length of the screw.\nThe essence of good ice protection is speed and reliability. The gear must be placed in\ntens of seconds to minimize climb-time, and thus fatigue. It must also sustain the forces\nproduced in the event of a fall (around 10 kN).\nExisting research is lacking in the area of ice protection technology. There a few\ndocumented tests in the public domain, but these tests have not been sufficiently\ncontrolled. The statistics from these tests, notably the Harmston, Luebben study in 19971\nand the study commissioned by Black Diamond,2 concluded that there is room for\nimprovement in ice protection performance.\nThere have been numerous papers into the study of ice mechanics and also into the\nstudy of the rheological nature of ice. This forms the basis of the literature review in\nSection 3.\n1. 2 Previous Work\nThere have been only two published studies directly relevant to the ice screw testing.\nThe first study carried out 6 years ago was performed in field. The second, more similar to\nthis project, was carried out in the laboratory on uncharacterized ice that was not fresh\nbut simply re-filled with water and re-frozen. Neither of these studies controlled the ice in\nwhich the ice screw was tested.\nThis project controls the ice test bed and is an\nimprovement on these previous studies. Further details of these projects can be found in\nSection 3.4.\n1. 3 Summary of Project\nThe motivation for this project is twofold. First, the poor performance of ice screws in\nexisting tests, and second, the lack of repeatability of the existing tests. The\ndevelopment of a standardized testing procedure will enable improvement of ice\nprotection in the future.\n\nThe project goals are, first, to produce a realistic simulation of the ice in the lab, and,\nsecond, to test the factors that affect the safety of ice screws and their placement. In\norder to realize this project, the procedure was:\n1)\nInvestigate and understand ice types and their formation.\n2)\nDevelop a method of repeatably replicating ice and produce two\ndifferent varieties of ice herein referred to as ABS1 and ABS2 (standing for\nAlziati-Bennett Standard).\n3)\nDevelop a controlled methodology for testing the factors that affect the\nsafety of the placement of ice screws.\nSuccessful completion of the primary goal will permit controlled testing and evaluation of\nice screws and will allow the industry to initiate standardized testing of ice protection,\n1. 4 Value to Technical and Climbing Community\nThis project is of value to the technical and the climbing community because it created\na methodology for making \"climbing ice\" types in the lab. Currently, there is no data\navailable on repeatable ice formation processes for testing ice-climbing equipment in\nthe public domain. If ice is effectively simulated in the laboratory, the industry will be\ncloser to setting safety standards and thus providing safer protection for climbers\neverywhere.\nAn inexpensive, reliable and realistic lab-based testing method for ice\nprotection would give strong support to the development of ice protection beyond its\npresent state.\nIf the first part of the experiment is fulfilled, then this project will go on to provide data on\ncurrent safety standards of ice climbing equipment. It is also hoped that this study will\nreduce the failure rate in ice climbing by being the first step in educating climbers about\nthe limits of their equipment and how to use that equipment most effectively.\n2. Statement of Project\nThe Primary Hypothesis is:\nThe structure and morphology of different types of ice formations can be\ncharacterized and simulated in a lab to provide a \"test bed\" useful for assessment of\nice screws.\nThe Secondary Hypothesis is:\n\nIf the above hypothesis is true, then using the simulated ice, the variables affecting\nscrew placement safety can be determined.\nThe objectives are then, first, to develop a repeatable means of reproducing ice in a lab\nand to characterize this ice using rheological data; or to understand why ice cannot be\nsimulated in the lab, and second, to use this ice model to test simulated falls on ice\nscrews in a manner closely related to climbing conditions.\nThe success criteria that will be used to measure the project are:\na) If hypothesis 1 is true, then success is characterizing the critical rheological\nproperties of ice.\nb) If hypothesis 1 is false, then success is identifying why ice cannot be made\nsuccessfully.\na) If hypothesis 2 is true, then success is the development of a test for ice screw\nsafety that produces consistent data and repeatable data.\nb) If hypothesis 2 is false, then success is identifying why ice screw performance\ncannot be characterized.\n3. Literature Review\nThe three topics of the literature review cover: the understanding of ice, ice testing\nresults, and ice screw testing and studies.\n3. 1 Understanding Ice\nThis section covers ice structure, ice formation, and the micro-mechanics of ice failure\n3. 1. 1 Ice Structure\nIce is close to melting at the temperatures at which it is encountered in climbing (around\n0o, according to the Harmston and Luebben study1). As such, it is a 'high temperature'\nmaterial that exhibits a wide variety of behavior that is dependent on a number of\nfactors. Ice can creep with little applied stress, or it can fracture in a brittle manner.\nThus, classical solutions do not work for analysis of ice; it is neither a 'simple elastic' nor an\n'elastic/plastic' solid.\nInstead, specific methods for its characterization must be\nundertaken.\n\nAccording to Schulson3, ice has 12 different crystallographic structures and 2 amorphous\nstates. The particular structure formed most commonly in nature is the Ih-type. This is\nformed by simply freezing water and has a hexagonal structure (see Figure 4).\nFigure 4: A schematic crystal structure of Ih ice\nThe oxygen atom is strongly covalenty bonded to the 2 hydrogens to form a single water\nmolecule, but, when frozen, the water molecules themselves are bonded weakly by\nhydrogen-bonds. Vacancies in the structure are predominantly point defects. It is these,\nalong with the dislocation density (the number of grain boundaries per unit volume), that\ndetermines the characteristics of the ice. The microstructure of the ice depends on its\nmechanical-thermal history. The mechanical-thermal history of the ice was especially\nimportant in stage 1 of this project because it was found that the initial condition of the\nice gave rise to different behaviors when subjected to a compression test.\n3. 1. 2 Ice Formation (morphology)\nThere are 3 main ways of forming natural ice:\n1.\nHeterogeneous nucleation at the surface of a slowly flowing water body.\n2.\nNucleation of frazil (Fine spicules, plates or discoids of ice suspended in water)\nparticles that appear in a fast flowing, supercooled water masses.\n3.\nThe freeze up of snow or atmospheric ice nuclei falling into the water.\nThese starting points for ice formation were considered in the context of producing ice in\na laboratory.\n\n3. 1. 3 Micromechanics of Failure\nAccording to Wu & Niu4, the main reason for ice failure is due to impurities at grain\nboundaries disrupting the overall structure. These impurities initiate early melting and\nmicrocracks.\nThe grain structure and orientation also affects the failure mode.\nThis\ninformation is important to how the macroscopic ice structure can be controlled in this\nproject (by addition of impurities in ABS2 for example).\n3. 2 Ice Testing Results\nThis section of the literature review focuses on the methods used to characterize the\nengineering properties of ice.\n3. 2. 1 Compressive Strength\nThe benchmark for compressive strength is set by uni-axial load tests on specimens in\nlaboratories5.\nThere have been numerous studies carried out on the ice in situ but\nanalysis of these tests was hampered by the complex stress states set up within the ice.\nTypical values for the range of compressive strength are from 0. 5 - 10 MPa. The mean\nvalue obtained in this experiment was 0. 5 MPa (see Section 5. 1).\n3. 2. 2 Flexural Strength\nFlexural strength is generally lower than the compressive strength for ice and typically\nranges from 0. 5-3 MPa. It should be noted that the temperature up to -5oC did not\ninfluence the flexural strength of the specimen. This is noted to be a test that must be set\nup in extremely carefully controlled conditions. It was deemed that replicating these\nconditions for this project was not a viable option.\n3. 2. 3 Ice Rheology\nThe stress-strain behavior of ice is important to understand as it has relevance to any\nstudy involving ice as a working material. 5 In a general sense, ice is described as a\nviscoelastic material. The simple spring dashpot model for ice is shown in Figure 5 below.\nThis model attempts to simulate the four deformation mechanisms of ice:\n1.\nElastic deformation due to atomic bonds changing length.\n2.\nDelayed elasticity due to sliding at the grain boundaries.\n3.\nViscous deformation due to dislocation movement within grains.\n4.\nDeformation due to microcracks in the ice.\n\nThe total strain of the ice is usually thought of as the sum of all these components. This\nmodel allows for both the creep of the ice and the ductile to brittle transition, as strain\nrates are increased. The fourth point is the most important in relation to the project as\nthe ice screw itself initiates many microcracks, and the primary reason for ice failure is the\npropagation of those cracks.\nFigure 5: A spring and dashpot model of ice. 6\n3. 2. 4 Temperature Dependency\nIt has been shown that, at temperatures up to -5oC, the flexural strength of the specimen\nis not influenced by temperature. 5,7 However at temperatures near zero, it was the\nimpurities at the grain boundaries that induced melting which meant that even the\nflexural strength of thick ice was zero. This temperature dependency is important for the\nproject as this indicates a marked change in behavior around the temperatures of\ninterest.\n3. 3 Making Ice\nInformation on the making of the ice was gathered, via email, from a current expert in\nthe field of ice mechanics, John Dempsey. 7 Full details on 'how to make (perfect) ice' is\nfound in Appendix A. Appendix A gives information on test apparatus insulation, tips on\nrepeatable crystal growth (such as the use of existing frost particles to nucleate ice grains\nin the specimen), and it also gives advice on how to allow for the expansion of the water\non freezing. This method was used to produce one ice type. The methods for making\nother types of ice were investigated in stage 1 of the project.\n\n3. 4 Ice Screw Studies\n3. 4. 1 The Harmston/Luebben Study\nHarmston and Luebben1 conducted tests that consist of placing ice screws into a natural\nice formation and dropping a 185 lb weight from various heights, while statically\nattached to the protection point, giving forces of between 8 kN - 12 kN. The results from\nthis test show that the screw ripped out of the ice 7 out of 12 times. A variety of variables\nwere tested, including screw angle and screw length.\nThe tests suggest that a\ndownward angle for the screw is most effective and that a longer screw is more likely to\nhold than a shorter screw.\nThe main conclusion drawn from the test was that ice\nconditions are so variable that it is difficult to accurately predict the holding strength of\nice screw placement.\nA critical examination of the test conditions suggest that many independent variables,\nincluding temperature, sun exposure and ice quality, were not controlled. Also, the\nuncontrolled method of dropping a weight onto the ice screw had no control over the\nstrain rate.\n3. 4. 2 Black Diamond Internal Study\nBlack Diamond Equipment has made its own investigations into ice screw effectiveness. 2\nThe tests consist of placing ice screws into an ice cell and then loading these cells in a\nUniversal Test Machine.\nThe ice cells were constrained by a steel container and\nprepared using untreated tap water. Freezing of the cells was at around -10oC and the\nwhole process took about 72 hours. Ice cells were regenerated 20 times by simply filling\nin the damaged hole and refreezing.\nIt was found in this study that the ice screws tested failed either by levering the hanger\noff the screw head, by breaking of the screw shaft, or by pulling the screw out of the ice.\nIt was also found that the screw placement angle was a significant factor in how much\nload the ice screw could withstand.\nThe limitations on this study are the unpredictable and variable nature of the ice cells\nused for testing. The cell composition was not tightly controlled and regeneration of the\ncell is not consistent.\n\n3. 5 Summary\nAll aspects of the literature review were taken into account during the development of\nthe project. The experimental method used in the Black Diamond Study was used as\nbasis for improvement in this project. The factors, identified in the literature review, that\naffect the behavior of ice were considered in this improvement.\nSince temperature was not a variable investigated, it was held constant at a value\nbelow -5oC in order that the ice would retain its brittle behavior. The Harmston/Luebben\nstudy identified screw placement angle as a significant variable affecting the amount of\nload a screw can support, thus the trends that they observed were investigated.\n4. Description of Experiment\n4. 1 Experimental Overview and Scope\nTo be able to test both hypotheses, the experiment was divided into two stages. The first\nstage consisted of experimenting with different types of methods for manufacturing ice\nand then characterizing each ice type produced. Stage 2 focused on using the method\nfor producing different ice types to test different variables that affect screw placement\nsafety.\n4. 1. 1 Stage 1 - Characterization of ice\nThe aim of this stage was to produce two different ice types (ABS1 and ABS2) with distinct\ncharacteristics and be sure that the specimens would consistently have the same\ncharacteristics. ABS1 was designed to be the \"good ice\", whereas ABS2 was intended to\nmimic one of the kinds of \"bad ice\" ice climbers encounter. The test matrix used for this\nstage is shown in Figure 6.\n\nFigure 6: Stage 1 test matrix.\nFirst, different recipes to produce several different ice specimens were investigated.\nSpecimens were frozen in containers made from 16 cm diameter PVC tubing cut to a\nheight of 16 cm.\nA sheet of strong flexible plastic, cut to a size that would overlap the\nedges of the tube's base, was taped to one end of tube. To ensure a watertight seal the\nbottom was covered using a latex rubber glove that was also taped into place. This not\nonly gave an ice specimen with a smooth bottom surface finish (due to the plastic sheet)\nbut also made extraction of the ice specimen a quick and easy process. Extraction of\nthe ice required only the removal of the temporary plastic sheet base of the tube and\nthen submersion in a stream of running water to loosen the ice from the tube walls. The\nonly drawback to this method was the necessary individual setting up of each specimen\ntube.\nThe method for producing ABS1 was freezing normal tap water to produce the most\nperfect ice possible.\nA greater focus was placed on finding a method for producing \"bad ice\" or ABS2. The\ndifferent methods attempted for making ABS2 were:\nMethod 1:\nMade using a mix of crushed ice, grit and gravel. The thickness of each\nlayer varied but overall there was a homogeneous spread of each\ncomponent. The vessel was then filled with water, taking care not to\ndisturb the crushed ice/grit structure by pouring in water at a slow rate\nand pouring it down the sides of the vessel.\n\nMethod 2:\nMade using dry sand (Multipurpose Play Sand, mesh 200). Construction\nwas in the same manner as Method 1. However this sand was laid in 30g\nsamples in between 500g of ice.\nMethod 3:\nSand was laid in 60g samples in between 500g of ice in a similar way to\nthat described in Method 1.\nMethod 4:\nSand was laid in 60g samples in between 250g of ice in a similar way to\nthat described in Method 1.\nMethod 5:\nMade using 50% carbonated water and 50% normal tap water and then\nfrozen in the normal manner. The carbonated water was poured into the\ncontainer first and then tap water was added making sure the final\nsolution was homogenous.\nMethod 6:\nMade using 25% carbonated water and 75% normal tap water in the\nsame manner as that described in method 5.\nFigure 7: Pictures of ABS1 (left) and ABS2 (right).\nA large number of specimens of ABS1 and ABS2 were then produced. Before any testing\ncould commence, each specimen had to be prepared.\nGenerally, most specimens\ncontained a number of minor surface cracks. The top of the sample open to the air, was\nnot always smooth and flat owing to internal stress build up in the later stages of growth\nwhen the tube itself was frozen. To rectify this problem, specimens were prepared by\ncutting off the top slice on a bandsaw. A slice was also cut for the impact testing.\nThe specimen prototypes produced using the above methods were then tested under a\ncompressive test. Each ice specimen was then tested under compressive load as shown\n\nin Figure 8. A fixed displacement rate of 0.508 mm/s was used in the MTS machine. The\nload was measured by a load cell and recorded onto the computer.\nThe density was also measured, and some impact testing was also performed.\nThe\ndensity calculation was carried out using a scale to measure the mass. The volume was\nfound from measuring the height and diameter of the specimen after preparation.\nThe impact testing consisted of dropping a solid steel ball, weighing 0.1kg and with a\ndiameter of 65 mm, from a fixed height of 1 m onto the flat surface of the ice specimen.\nThe indentation on the surface was then measured. The results of this test were judged\ninconclusive as the surface indentation was too small to differentiate between individual\ntests.\nFigure 8: Preparing ABS2 for testing (left) and ABS2 being tested (right).\nBased on the results of the above tests one method was then selected for the production\nof the official ABS2. Selection criteria were:\n1. Largest difference between results for compressive tests.\n2. Ease of production.\nEven though Methods 3 and 4 produced ice with much larger mean compressive\nstrength than ABS1, the production method was so labor intensive that it was not\npractical on a large scale. Method 5 produced an even lower mean than Method 6.\n\nHowever the high proportion of carbonated water in the specimen meant that, often,\nlarge air pockets would develop, rendering that specimen useless. After consideration of\nall these factors, Method 6 was selected for the production of ABS2.\n4. 1. 2 Stage 2 - Ice Screw Testing\nThe aim of this stage was to place ice screws in the different types of ice and investigate\nthe factors which influence the failure of the ice and ice screw interface. The variables\ninvestigated here were ice type, screw placement angle and loading rate as shown by\nthe test matrix in Figure 9. Figure 10 shows the definition of screw placement angle, the\nvariable in the third dimension of the test matrix.\nFigure 9: Stage 2 test matrix.\nFigure 10: Schematic of screw placement.\nThis stage required larger samples of ABS1 and ABS2. This time, PVC containers 30 cm in\ndiameter (internal), 40 cm in height and 15 mm thickness were used. The container walls\nwere lined with large plastic bags. The bags were standard trash bags and were taped\n\ninto place using duct tape. The seal of the bags to the tubes was not airtight to allow\ntrapped air in the tube base to escape when the vessel was filled. Importantly, these\nspecimens were made in the freezer and not moved until completed. They were filled\nwith a hose and left for a period of days to freeze slowly. Samples were made as\ndescribed in Section 4.1.1. This method allowed both ends of the ice specimen to be\nused by simply removing the plastic sheeting from the bottom.\nAs can be seen in Figure 11, each specimen was frozen with a plastic tube inside so as to\nreduce the internal stresses. When the top surface of the ice freezes, the remaining\nwater continues to freeze and expand, if left unchecked this causes a build up of\npressure under the top surface, which would lead to cracking. The tube allows water to\nbe pushed up and out above the top surface as the interior expands.\nBefore experimenting commenced, tests were carried out to determine the length of\nspecimen required so that each end of ice specimen could be used while remaining\nstructurally unaffected by the experimentation on the other end. The size of each ice\nspecimen in stage 2 made their construction an extremely laborious process. Having\ndetermined the length of specimen and corresponding length of ice screw required in\norder that both ends could be used for testing purposes, the testing time was effectively\nhalved. Once the specimen was frozen, the plastic bag over the base could simply be\nripped off and an ice screw could then be screwed in to both ends.\nThe ice screws used in the experimentation were Black Diamond Turbo Ice Screws 13 cm\nin length. This size was chosen as longer screws would have been too long for the\n'infinite' ice surface to be effectively modeled within the confines of the chosen model.\nOnce the ice specimen was ready, an ice screw was screwed into it at the appropriate\nangle. The specimen was then strapped to a rig mounted on the MTS machine and the\nice screw was pulled down. The ice was left in the PVC tubing throughout testing in\norder to effectively model the 'infinite' ice wall surface.\n\nFigure 11: ABS1 sample for stage 2 testing.\nThe test rig was built using steel uni-struts as shown in Figure 12. The whole jig was about\n90 cm in height, 40 cm wide and 25 cm deep. The thickness of the uni-struts used was 40\nmm to be able to withstand the magnitude of the load without significant deformation.\nThe whole gig was then assembled firmly to the MTS machine. In order to counteract the\ntorque of the MTS machine pulling down on the ice screw, the gig was braced using a\nsteel ratchet and pulley system pulling in the direction opposite to the applied load.\nThe ice screw was then attached to the arm of the MTS machine, which was set to pull at\nthe desired load rate. The load on the screw was recorded by a load cell and logged\non to a computer.\n\nFigure 12: Test rig setup (left) and ice screw being pulled (right).\n4. 2 Data Analysis and Error Mitigation\nData was logged using a load cell in both stage 1 and stage 2. In stage 1, data was\ntransmitted at a frequency of 4 Hz, whereas in stage 2, data was taken at 500 Hz. The\nnumber of data points recorded was close to 500,000. This data was reduced and\nplotted using Microsoft Excel, and the value of compressive strength for each test was\nread off these graphs.\nThe measurement errors in the load cells were minimal. The specifications of the two\nload cells used can be found in Appendix C. A maximum error of - 5N was measured,\nand this was regarded as negligible, considering the large amount of data scatter due\nto the natural random behavior of ice.\nThe degree of scatter in the data for each test was measured using a standard deviation\ncalculation. This was compared to the mean to have a measure of the uncertainty and\nlimits either way of the mean value. The one-tailed f-stat test was used to compare data\nsets, such as when the data set of ABS1 was compared to that of ABS2. This test\ncompares the spread of two sets of results obtained, and produces a numeric probability\nof the chance that the means of the two samples are different. Once again calculations\nwere performed in Microsoft Excel.\n\n5. Stage 1 - Results & Discussion\n5.1 Selection of ABS2\nThe methods described for producing prototypes of ABS2 in Section 4 were all tested.\nSome methods were investigated to a greater extent than others because they proved\nto be easier than others. Methods 2, 3 and 4 were very labor intensive and it was judged\nthat they were unsuitable for producing specimens in a larger scale. Method 1 was a\nlittle less labor intensive but was not tightly controlled and produced results with a large\nstandard deviation. Table 1 shows the mean compressive strengths and standard\ndeviations for each method investigated.\nTable 1: Mean compressive tests for all the methods\nIce Type\nABS 1\nABS2\nMethod 1 Method 2 Method 3 Method 4 Method 5 Method 6\nMean Compressive\nStrength (N)\nStandard Deviation\n(N)\nNumber of Tests\nperformed\nIt is observable from the table that Method 5 appears to be better than method 6 as the\nmean compressive strength is lower than the one for method 6 and ABS1 and the\nstandard deviation is also lower. However, while making specimens using Method 5\nseveral of them had to be discarded because of huge air pockets just under the surface\nlayer which made them unsuitable for testing. The five specimens that were tested were\ncut at a height below the air pocket. Unfortunately it wouldn't have been possible to\ncut the larger specimen for testing in stage 2, so it was decided that Method 6 was the\nmost suitable for stage 2.\n\n5. 2 Density Test\nThe density test, which was described in Section 4 yielded the following mean results:\nTable 2: Mean value and standard deviation for density.\nIce\nMean Density\nStandard\nType\n(kg/m3)\nDeviation (kg/m3)\nABS1\n0. 78\nABS2\n31. 8\nThe F-Stat test indicated a 97% probability of ABS1 being different to ABS2. This is due to\nthe fact that the standard deviations are significantly less than the mean value for\ndensity. It is noticeable that the standard deviation for ABS2 is much greater than that\nfor ABS1. ASB2 samples would occasionally have a slightly larger air bubble close to the\nsurface. This is due to the surface of specimen freezing before the core and providing no\nescape route for the bubbles which accumulate just below this surface.\nThe calculated f-stat suggests that the density test differentiates between the two ice\ntypes.\nThus, it is possible to simulate and characterize different types of ice in the\nlaboratory, and the hypothesis for stage 1 has been proved correct.\n5.3 Impact Tests\nAfter 6 impact tests were performed, the instrumentation available was judged improper\nfor this method of testing. In general, the indentation produced on the ice surface would\nnot be more than 2 mm. It was observed, however, that thin specimens, in the order of\n50 mm would commonly crack into two pieces instead of producing an indent.\n5.4 Compressive Tests\nIn total 35 compressive tests were performed, of which 9 tests were on the chosen ABS1\nand 10 on the chosen ABS2.\nThe remaining tests were performed on the other\nprototypes of \"bad ice\".\nTypical graphs of load against displacement for the\ncompressive tests on ABS1 and ABS2 are shown in Figure 13.\n\nFigure 13: Typical graphs for compressive test on ABS1 and ABS2.\nThe value of compressive strength for each test was taken as the first peak in the graph.\nAfter the first peak the specimen would crack and shatter into smaller fragments, after\nwhich point the surface area was unknown.\nAfter data processing the following\nproperties were attributed to each ice type:\n\nTable 3: Mean values and standard deviations for compressive strength\nIce\nMean Compressive\nStandard\nCompressive\nType\nstrength (N)\nDeviation (N)\nStress (MN/m2)\nABS1\n0. 487\nABS2\n0. 398\nABS1 and ABS2 have different mean compressive strengths. However, the standard\ndeviations are large when compared with the mean compressive strength value,\nindicating a wide scatter in data. This was tested using an f-Stat Test function. This test\nindicated that there was only a 9% chance of ABS1 being different to ABS2. Judging by\nthe data obtained and looking at the f-stat calculated, it is argued that the compressive\ntest is of no quantitative statistical significance.\nThe test did however give some important qualitative observations about the behavior of\neach ice type. After the compressive test was performed on ABS1, the specimen stuck\nto the plates and fingers, whereas ABS2 would be wet to the touch. It is believed this is\nrelated to the mechanism and hence, the amount of energy absorbed by each ice\nspecimen. Owing to its very brittle nature, ABS1 is not able to absorb much energy and\nhence, at the end of the experiment, is still very cold and able to stick to the plates. By\ncomparison, ABS2 absorbed far more energy to the point where the surface was melting,\nfollowing the experiment.\nThis observation and theory is corroborated by the graphs presented previously.\nThe\ngraph of ABS1 shows sharp peaks and very steep lines. For ABS2, the peaks are more\nrounded and the lines are less steep. The area underneath the curve can be considered\nto be proportional to the energy transferred to the specimen. On the graph the x-axis\ncan be interchanged between time and displacement since the piston (arm) was\ndisplaced at a fixed rate. Hence, it is observable that ABS2 stored more energy before it\nfailed in compression. Another indicator of this is the fact that ABS1 tended to fail much\nmore explosively in a brittle fashion than ABS2.\nThe actual fracture load is highly dependent on initial crack distribution and other\nstarting conditions.\nOwing to this fact, the force vs. displacement curves may\ncharacterize the ice better than the value of maximum load. To be able to compare the\nslopes of the curves, the faces of the specimens should have been evenly cut so the\ncross sectional areas were constant across samples and the same for the heights of the\nspecimens. Unfortunately heights of the samples tested were not kept constant and\n\nwere not measured in this project, so no further analysis on the graphs could be carried\nout.\n6. Stage 2 - Results & Discussion\nStage 2 consisted of screwing ice screws into ABS1 and ABS2 specimens and recording\nthe load at which the screws pulled out. In total, 36 pull tests were performed, of which\n20 were on ABS1 and 16 on ABS2. A typical set of curves of force against displacement\nfor the stage 2 testing is shown below.\nFigure 134: Typical set of curves for pull tests on ABS1.\nThe graph set in Figure 14 shows a steady ramp to the peak value where the screw/ice\ninterface then breaks and the sustainable load drops to zero. The failure load of any test\nwas taken to be the first peak in each graph. The data set labeled as 'Test 5' shows a\nsecond peak; this was where the ice screw became caught once again in the broken\nice and then was able to again sustain a load before failing once more.\nIt was observed that the graphs for the faster loading rates were not as closely grouped\nas those for the corresponding slower rates. This again goes back to the point made in\nSection 5.4 that the faster, more brittle failures are more subject to the initial conditions of\nthe ice. The faster test causes the ice to yield in the brittle manner whereas the slower\nrate test allows the ice to deform to a certain degree, and thus redistribute the stress and\nreduce the stress concentrations in certain areas. The results for all the tests can be\nfound in Appendix B.\nABS 1, Slow Rate, Negative 30 degrees\n0.0\n5.0\n10.0\n15.0\n20.0\n25.0\n30.0\n35.0\n40.0\nDisplacement (mm)\nLoad (N)\nTest 5\nTest 6\nTest 7\nTest 8\n\nIt should be noted that, since the sample size so was small (2-4 data points), the standard\ndeviation of the sample does not necessarily give a reflection of the data. More tests\nneed to be carried out to substantiate these findings. The major result from stage 2 is the\nfollowing graph in Figure 14, which groups all the processed data obtained. This graph\ndoes not show the trends observed in the Harmston & Luebben study (Figure 16).\nInstead, it does not show any trend; rather it confirms that the optimum placement angle\nfor screw placement is at zero degrees, i.e. perpendicular to the wall.\nFigure 15: Graph showing Stage 2 data, failure load of the ice screw plotted against screw placement angle.\nPeak Mean Failure Load vs. Screw Placement angle\n-35\n-25\n-15\n-5\nAngle\nFailure Load (N)\nABS 1 (low rate)\nABS 1 (high rate)\nABS 2 (low rate)\nABS 2 (high rate)\n\nScrew\n\"Bad Ice\"\nLoad\n(high rate)\n\"Bad Ice\" (low rate)\n\"Good Ice\" (high rate)\n\"Good Ice\" (low rate)\nangle\n- ve\n+ ve\nFigure 16: Graph showing the trends observed in the Harmston/Luebben study\nFigure 15 does show a trend with the loading rates. It can be seen that the mean results\nfor the lower loading rates give much higher failure loads than those using the higher\nloading rates. It is speculated that the reason for this observation is that at the slower\nloading rate the ice is allowed to deform and distribute the load more evenly throughout\nthe screw/ice interface. At the higher loading rate however, the ice screw simply rips\nthrough the ice in a brittle fashion. The ice does not have time to adapt, and stress\nconcentrations occur.\nFigure 15 also shows the strongest screw/ice interface at the optimum screw placement\nangle is that of ABS2. The thousands of tiny bubbles within the ice act as a honeycomb\nstructure. It is thought that the air pockets provide crumple zones and thus allow ABS2 to\nabsorb more energy than ABS1, which has no such zones. One further explanation is that\nthe bubbles act as crack blunters and prevent the crack from propagating.\n\nFigure 17: Mean failure load for ABS1 and ABS2 at high/low rate and all angles.\nFigure 17 shows the range of failure data obtained for each different loading rate case.\nIt is clear that, in almost all cases, the zero degree placement angle gives the highest\npullout load. Also observable is that, for a low load rate case a negative angle is\npreferable to a positive angle, whereas for a high load rate case the positive angle holds\nmore than the negative one.\nIn the lower loading rate case the negative screw\nplacement angle puts the load path in line with the pulling force from the MTS machine,\nthus allowing the screw threads to hold the load. In the higher loading rate case the\npositive angle of screw placement allows the ice screw to hold a higher load because\nthe ice screw must then shear through 'extra' ice before it can be pulled out. The nature\nof the high rate pull out is that stress concentrations build up and break the ice in a brittle\nfashion, the positive screw placement angle puts more ice in the path of the failure\ncrack than the negative angle.\n\n7. Summary and Conclusion\n7. 1 Major Findings\nThe density test used in stage 1 does provide an accurate way of characterizing ice. The\ncompressive test, however, is not a valid test for measuring characteristics of ice\nbecause of the high dependency of initial conditions of the ice specimen.\nNevertheless, the density test should not be used as the unique method for\ncharacterizing ice. It must be used in conjunction with another characteristic, because\nclearly it is possible for two different ice specimens to have the same density, and yet be\nsignificantly different.\nAnother finding, and possibly the most valuable to the climbing community, is the much\ngreater dependency of loading rate on failure load rather than screw placement angle\nor ice type. This is significant to climbers as they have some control over the loading rate\non an ice screw.\nUsing a combination of ropes that can stretch more and friction\ndevices in the belay system, the loading rate on an ice screw can be reduced\nsignificantly. This project has shown that a decrease in loading rate of a factor of 100\ngives an increase in the supportable load of a factor of three.\n7. 2 Suggestions For Future Work\nAs an extension to this project several areas of development have been suggested.\n-\nResearch on new methods for making a greater number of different ice types\nwould lead eventually to the production of an ice type that mimics ice found in\nthe environment to a higher level than the ones used in this project.\n-\nResearch must be carried out into the determination of other possible tests that\ncan characterize ice effectively. This would allow the evaluation of the efficiency\nof the methods for producing repeatable ice types.\n-\nResearch to investigate the effects of screw length on failure load would be very\nuseful to the climbing community.\n\n8.

I'll give it a go. What size freezer do you have?\nLarger blocks will produce better results.\nSuppose that you make up a cube of a box (quite well made so that it does not leak)-\nmake it out of some softwood so that it absorbs water?? Cube of dimension N cm;\nsuppose N is something like 25. Now insulate the bottom and all sides of the box; could\njust use that blue styrofoam but make the wall thickness of the order of 12 cm.\nThis is to stop any freezing nucleation on the sides or bottom. Now fill the box with cold\nwater and put it in the freezer-prepare for leakage because the ice will try to expand\noutwards---which is why you want as much surrounding insulation as possible.\nIf you have the patience, monitor the temperature and stir that water so that\nit all cools more or less uniformly; right near freezing use some of the frost in the freezer as\nseed crystals and float the frost on top.\nThis method should give you repeatable clear blocks - the slower you grow the ice the\nbetter it will be in terms of say dislocation density etc.\nOh, almost forgot, you need a pressure release under the ice as it grows-\nlike a pipe fitted to the side at the bottom-insulated or wrapped in heat\ntape, so that as the ice grows down, it will push water out the pipe-angle the pipe to\nmaintain more or less the same pressure (head).\nIn other words, let this excess\nwater drip into a bucket or some such.\nBe careful of thermal shock-let the ice warm up slowly. You can work at 0 Celsius or very\nnear. I have observed with warm ice, that when you turn ice screws into it, you get these\nvery fine radial crack under the expansion-interesting.\n\nTemperature of the ice is probably your main variable.

Current\nmechanisms, such as paper honeycomb, occupy a significant volumetric fraction of UAV\npayload capacity. Hypotheses were formulated regarding the performance of expanding\nfoam as compared to honeycomb using the metrics: crush thickness efficiency, pre-\ndeployment volume, and foam expansion reliability. These metrics were evaluated for a\npayload with a vertical descent rate of 13.5 feet per second and a 50g impact shock limit.\nThe experiment concluded that the crush efficiency of expanding foam is at least 72.7%\nof the crush efficiency of paper honeycomb, thus proving the hypothesis regarding crush\nefficiency. The expanding foam is 83% reliable, with 95% confidence, to expand to its\nexpected volume within 30 seconds, thus disproving the hypothesis regarding foam\nexpansion reliability. The pre-deployment volume of expanding foam is at most 33.6%\nthe pre-deployment volume of paper honeycomb; however the hypothesis regarding pre-\ndeployment volume was not assessed within experimental error. Other findings provide\ninsight into the behavior of expanding foam and honeycomb during impact.\n\n.\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n1.\nINTRODUCTION..................................................................................................... 8\n1.1.

Introduction\n\n1.1. Background and Motivation\nDelivery of small payloads is one of many concepts currently under development\nto enhance the functionality of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). UAVs are remotely\npiloted or autonomous aircraft that can carry cameras, sensors, communications\nequipment or other payloads, and have been used in reconnaissance and intelligence-\ngathering since the 1950's. Small parafoils, deployed when payloads are released from\nUAVs, are a promising delivery method for such payloads and typically show a deployed\npayload's vertical descent rate of approximately 15 feet per second. A shock absorption\nmechanism is then often necessary to attenuate the impact shock at touchdown.\nCurrent inexpensive and reliable low-impact attenuators such as paper\nhoneycomb and crushable foam occupy a significant fraction of the volumetric capacity\nof UAV payload compartments. More complex impact attenuators such as deployable\nairbags and retractable mechanisms occupy less pre-deployment UAV payload volume.\nYet, they greatly increase cost and/or compromise reliability. A new impact attenuation\nconcept that reduces pre-deployment UAV payload volume without significantly\nincreasing cost or reducing reliability is therefore desirable. An expanding foam impact\nattenuation device may serve this purpose.\n1.2. Short Overview of Project\nThis project involved a series of experiments to assess whether expanding foam could\nprovide efficient and reliable impact attenuation and occupy a minimal volume onboard\nthe UAV. This assessment was conducted by quantitatively comparing the characteristics\nof expanding foam and honeycomb relevant to deploying small packages from UAVs.\nInstapak(r) (Figure 1), a commercially available expanding foam product manufactured\nby SealedAir Corporation was compared to a paper honeycomb product manufactured by\nPactiv Corporation. Products such as Instapak expanding foam and Pactive paper\nhoneycomb are used to protect delicate items in shipping containers from impact shock.\n\nFigure 1: Instapak Expanding Foam\n\n1.3. Hypothesis\nThe primary hypothesis stated that the pre-deployment volume of an expanding\nfoam impact attenuation device would occupy at most 25% of the volume occupied by\npaper honeycomb, and that the material would have a crush thickness efficiency of at\nleast 70% of the corresponding value for paper honeycomb. The secondary hypothesis\nstated that an expanding foam deployment device would cost at most 50% more than\npaper honeycomb and have a deployment reliability of at least 90% of the corresponding\nvalue for paper honeycomb.\n1.4. Objective\nAssess the ability of expanding foam to protect a payload having a 50 g-impact\nshock limit from a 15 feet per second vertical descent rate. This assessment was\nconducted by comparing the pre-deployment volume, crush efficiency, cost and\nreliability of expanding foam against paper honeycomb.\n1.5. Success Criteria\nEvaluate the aforementioned metrics for expanding foam and paper honeycomb to\nan accuracy such that the hypotheses can be assessed.\n1.6. Objectives Met\nAn impact velocity of 15 feet per second could not be achieved consistently\nduring the experiment. Instead, the experiment was conducted for an impact velocity of\n13.5 ± 0.3 feet per second.\nThe hypotheses regarding attenuator efficiency and deployment reliability were\nassessed within experimental error; however, the hypothesis regarding pre-deployment\nvolume could not be proved or disproved. This experiment confirmed that the crush\n\nefficiency of expanding foam is at least 70% of the crush efficiency of paper honeycomb,\nand disproved the hypothesis that the foam expansion reliability is at least 90%.\n\n2. Literature Review\n\nAlthough there does not appear to be previous research investigating the use of an\nexpanding foam material to attenuate the impact of objects deployed from aerial vehicles,\nthere is a great body of literature laying the foundation for such a research experiment.\nThis literature includes various experiments employing standard shock impact testing\nmethodologies, and one resource discussing the use of honeycomb material to attenuate\nthe impact of small payloads deployed from UAVs.\n\nThe paper entitled \"Design and Testing of the HOPE-X HSFD-II Landing\nSystem\" written by Gardiner1 discusses the design, analysis and preliminary testing of the\nairbag impact attenuation system for the re-entry of the unmanned space vehicle. The\npaper describes the technical design of the parachute and airbag subsystems, including\nmaterials, construction, and deployment techniques. Simulation tools are used to analyze\nparachute performance, and simulate airbag performance during impact. Airbag drop\ntesting is then performed to validate the simulations. Drop tests include both vertical and\nhorizontal impact velocity components controlled using a rail system. Test output data\nincludes 3-axis acceleration, airbag pressure, rotational rate, vent release monitoring, and\nhigh-speed video, and all data is recorded digitally at 1000Hz bandwidth. Gardiner found\nthat drop tests verified computer simulations, and computer simulations were then used to\nevaluate multiple airbag configurations.\n\nThe design and testing of the HOPE-X landing system is primarily focused on\nsimulation verification. Although this aspect of the paper was not useful in designing our\nimpact attenuation experiment, the HOPE-X landing system drop test experiment design\nprovides a baseline with which to design a drop-test rig. Our impact attenuation\nexperiment was constrained to studying the effect of a vertical impact, and so we were\nnot interested in rotational rates. However, a railing system to control the drop, an\naccelerometer, and a high-speed camera were incorporated into our experiment. Also, the\n\n1000Hz bandwidth requirement provided a useful guideline for the selection of a data\nacquisition module.\n\nAnother paper entitled, \"Parachute Retraction Soft-Landing Systems Using\nPneumatic Muscle Actuators\" written by Brown and Haggard2 discusses the analysis and\ntesting of flexible composite technology actuators. The actuators contract in the moments\nbefore impact to significantly slow the descent of a payload under a parachute. Brown\nand Haggard derive a theoretical model for the tension in an ideal actuator as a function\nof contraction, and use static testing to determine the validity of their model. Static\ntesting also provides a measure of the efficiency for the real actuators. Dynamic drop-\ntests are then conducted to demonstrate the payload velocity reduction due to retraction.\nThe drop-test setup involves placing a load cell between the payload and retraction\nactuator, and deriving peak force, peak acceleration, and change in velocity from the\nforce versus time data.\n\nWhile the actual parachute retraction system is not relevant to our project, this\nwork echoes the drop-test methodology laid out in the design and testing of the HOPE-X\nlanding system. Although we intended to use an accelerometer rather than a load cell to\nrecord behavior during impact, this paper verifies that initial impact velocity of the\npayload can be successfully extracted from the impact data. Also, this paper distinguishes\nbetween static and dynamic testing. We determined an actual attenuation efficiency using\nstatic testing and verified performance through dynamic testing as this paper describes.\n\nChristian Anderson at Draper laboratories has also provided a very relevant paper\nentitled, \"Impact Shock Attenuation for Parafoil Payloads\".* Anderson's work is the only\navailable resource studying impact attenuation materials for use on small payloads\ndeployed from unmanned aerial vehicles. He derives quantitative relationships among\nimpact shock parameters showing two very important facts. Required cushion thickness\nis proportional the square of payload's initial velocity, while material properties\ndetermine the deceleration of the payload. He also defines a metric called material crush\nthickness efficiency to describe the amount of initial cushion thickness required to\nachieve a certain crush displacement. These quantitative relationships are then used to\nchoose a honeycomb impact attenuator with the proper dynamic crush stress to shield a\n\n* Unpublished Work, given to team February 2003.\n\ngiven payload from an impact shock greater than 30g. Anderson then verifies results by\nmeasuring payload deceleration during drop testing.\n\nThis 16.62x project builds directly on Anderson's work, which provides a strong\nquantitative basis for comparing attenuation properties of expanding foam with\nhoneycomb. A selection of this work can be found in Appendix A. Anderson's theory\ncoupled with standard drop-test methodologies provide the basis for exploring a novel\nimpact attenuation system for payloads deployed from UAVs.\n\n3. Description of Experiment\n\n3.1. Experiment Overview\nA flowchart describing the experiment overview is presented in Figure 2. The\nexperiment was divided into two segments and reflects the separation between the\nprimary and secondary hypotheses.\n\nFigure 2: Experiment Overview Flowchart\n\nOnce attenuation materials and payload properties were determined, the crush\nthickness efficiencies were characterized for both honeycomb and expanding foam. The\ncrush thickness efficiency* is defined as the ratio of the crush displacement of the impact\nmaterial to its cushion thickness before impact.\n\n* Definition taken from unpublished work by Chris Anderson entitled, \"Impact Shock Attenuation for\nParafoil Payloads\"\n\nCrush efficiency was measured though quasi-static and dynamic tests. Quasi-\nstatic tests involved using a force-press to crush the test materials, and dynamic tests\ninvolved dropping payloads of constant mass and constant base area protected by\nattenuation materials. Dynamic tests were specifically conducted to explore the\npossibility of velocity-dependent attenuation characteristics not revealed through quasi-\nstatic testing.\n\nDrop-tests were then conducted to characterize an adequate cushion safety margin\nbased on a distribution of peak accelerations experienced by the payload during impact.\nFinally, using this safety margin, pre-deployment volumes were calculated for\nhoneycomb and expanding foam.\n\nThis experiment did not include the design and testing of an expanding foam\ndeployment mechanism and thus the secondary hypothesis regarding deployment\nreliability and cost was not assessed. However, a measure of foam expansion reliability\nindependent of a deployment mechanism was quantified. This foam expansion reliability\nwas compared to the honeycomb deployment reliability. Honeycomb deployment\nreliability was defined as 100% since honeycomb does not need to be deployed.\n3.2. Apparatus\n3.2.1. Test Setups\nThe experiment tests were performed using three distinct test setups.\n1. An Instron(r) force press (at the MIT TELAC laboratories) was used to perform\nquasi-static load tests of both expanding foam and paper honeycomb. Values of crush\nthickness efficiency and crush stress were derived from data obtained during these tests.\n2. A vertical drop-test rig was built on the strong wall at the MIT Gelb laboratory\nand is shown in Figure 3. This was used for the dynamic crush thickness efficiency tests\nof each material and, later on, for safety margin tests to obtain a distribution of the peak\naccelerations experienced by the payload during impact.\n\nFigure 3: Drop-test Rig\n\nThe drop-test rig consisted of two 6 foot high shafts that were held up by two\nUnistrut(r) frames and that guided the payload in a vertical descent. The frames, plus a\nbeam holding the pulley from which the payload hung, were clamped to the strong wall.\nThis made it necessary to clamp a 2 inch high platform at the bottom of the test rig such\nthat the line of sight to the attenuation material during impact would not be obstructed by\nthe bottom frame. Finally, the rope wire holding the payload was attached to a quick-\nrelease loop and to a winch.\nThe main function of the shafts was to ensure that the bottom surface of the\npayload landed horizontally and that the impact attenuation material was crushed evenly.\nHowever, friction and a slight outward buckling in the shafts slowed down the payload\nduring its descent. Although time constraints prohibited the implementation of possible\nsolutions, it is likely that impact velocity could have been increased through one or both\nof the following improvements:\n- using ball bearings rather than linear bearings to guide the payload and decrease\nthe friction with the shafts; and\n- adding tension to the shafts to unload the compressive force that was causing the\nshafts to buckle during the descent of the payload.\nPulleys and a quick-release mechanism were necessary such that the payload\ncould be released from a distance, and a winch was used to lift the payload before every\ndrop during the tests.\n\n3. An InstapakQuick Warmer (shown in Figure 4) and four wooden boards\ncomprised the setup for the foam deployment reliability tests. The unexpanded Instapak\nfoam bags were heated for at least thirty minutes and then placed between the four\nwooden boards, which were clamped together, describing a 5 inch by 12 inch base area.\nThe boards were 5 inches high to allow the foam to expand within this constrained\nvolume.\n\nwarmer\n\nFigure 4: Instapak Quick Warmer\n\n3.2.2. Instrumentation\nThe instrumentation used to collect data during the tests included the following.\n1. The load cell in the MTS Instron force press, which outputs load and\ndisplacement of the test material during crush.\n2. A high speed camera and its accompanying MIDAS Video Software running\non an adjacent computer, in which the attenuation material could be observed frame by\nframe during crush at 2000Hz. The software facilitated the maximum crush displacement\nmeasurement during the dynamic crush efficiency tests. Furthermore, the software,\nwhich calculated the velocity of a point between consecutive frames, was used to confirm\nan impact velocity of 13.5 ± 0.3 feet per second during the safety margin tests.\n3. A Crossbow accelerometer was attached to the payload and connected to an\nanalog to digital converter. This signal was recorded using LabView on an adjacent\n\ncomputer. The accelerometer was used to measure acceleration (shock) during crush for\nthe safety margin tests.\n4. Calipers were used to measure the initial cushion thicknesses of every sample\nof material tested, as well as the post-deployment volume of expanding foam during the\nreliability tests.\n5. The pre-deployment volume of the expanding foam bags was measured by\ndisplacing water in a beaker.\n3.3. Test Articles\nThe test articles throughout this project were paper honeycomb and expanding foam.\nThese materials were cut to the appropriate dimensions using the band saw in the MIT\nGelb laboratory workshop, crushed at the Instron force press for the quasi-static tests, and\nattached to the bottom of the payload box for drop-tests. Expanding foam was also the\ntest article for the expansion reliability tests. The Instapak expanding foam product used\nis shown in Figure 1. Hexacomb700TM paper honeycomb, which is manufactured by\nPactiv Corporation, is shown in Figure 5.\n\nFigure 5: Sliced 1-inch Honeycomb\n\n3.3.1. Paper Honeycomb\nAll the paper honeycomb samples tested, which were required to be of different\nthicknesses for different tests, had the same cell sizes to ensure a consistent material\nbehavior during crush. This was an issue during the project because paper honeycomb\nfree samples are only available in discrete thicknesses down to 3⁄4-inch, which was not\nthin enough to guarantee that the material would crush completely during the dynamic\n\ncrush efficiency tests. This challenge was overcome by slicing in half the 1-inch thick\nhoneycomb samples using the band saw, as can be seen was done for the top samples on\nFigure 5.\n3.3.2. Expanding Foam\nThe Instapak foam was expanded using the setup for the reliability tests. After\nthe bags had been heated, the two chemicals were mixed by alternatively pushing the sacs\nthat contain them inside the bag until these burst and the bag started expanding, as shown\nin Figure 6. The foam was taken out of the plastic bag before being sliced to the proper\ndimensions. Since these samples were more irregular than the honeycomb samples,\nspecial care was taken to measure the cushion areas and thicknesses of the expanding\nfoam samples to confirm that these met the parameters dictated for each test.\n\nFigure 6: Foam Expansion Procedure\n\n3.3.3. Payload Box\nThe dynamic tests were performed by taping the impact attenuation materials to\nthe bottom of the payload box that was attached to the vertical shafts of the test rig. The\nbox, shown in Figure 7, was built out of 0.7 inch thick plywood and with wooden\nreinforcements in all inner edges. Each side was glued and then bolted to these\nreinforcements. The box proved to be sturdy and did not brake or crack during the\nduration of the drop tests.\nThe payload mass had to be changed to ensure that each sample, given the\nmaterial crush stress and the sample area, would crush completely during the dynamic\ncrush efficiency tests. As shown in Figure 7(a), long screws were attached inside the box\nsuch that the masses could be bolted down to prevent any safety hazards and mitigate the\neffects of the mass rebound on the impact acceleration measurements.\n\nFigure 7: (a) Payload Box, (b) Top View of Payload Attached to Drop-test Rig\n\nThe linear bearings that were used to attach the payload to the test rig shafts were bolted\ntowards the upper edge of the box so that deviations from a vertical fall would not be\nexacerbated. Finally, the accelerometer was bolted towards the base of the box to\nminimize the readout of the payload vibrations after impact. This can be seen in Figure\n7(b).\n\n4. Description of Tests\n\n4.1. Crush Efficiency\n4.1.1. Scope\nThe crush thickness efficiency was defined for this experiment as\ncushion\ncrush\nt\nx\nτ\nη =\n,\n(Eq. 1)\nwhere\nis the maximum displacement during crush and\ncrush\nx\ncushion\nτ\nis the initial cushion\nthickness. This parameter gives a measure of how much initial cushion thickness of a\ncertain material is required to achieve the necessary crush displacement during impact.\nThis metric is important because payload volume capacity will be reduced to compensate\nfor the extra attenuation material necessary to achieve the required cushion thickness\nbefore impact. Tests conducted in this experiment sought to characterize appropriate\ncrush efficiencies for honeycomb and expanding foam to protect a payload with a 13.5\nfoot per second vertical descent rate from a 50g impact shock limit. Although the crush\nefficiencies characterized in this experiment are related to material properties, they do not\ndefine a material property of the attenuation material.\n\n4.1.2. Methods\nQuasi-static tests to determine crush efficiency were conducted using the Instron\nforce-press and involved loading the attenuation materials with increasing force and\nmonitoring the material displacement. These tests yielded stress versus displacement\ncurves similar to the conceptual figure shown below.\n\nStress\nDisplacement\nCrush Displacement\n\nFigure 8: Conceptual Stress vs. Displacement Curve\n\nThe crush displacement was defined as the displacement from zero force to the measured\ndisplacement where the stress-displacement curve transitions from a plateau to a steep\nslope. Quasi-static crush efficiency was then determined by taking the ratio of crush\ndisplacement to initial cushion thickness.\n\nDynamic tests involved dropping the payload-attenuation material system from a\ncertain height using less cushioning material than was calculated to be necessary to\nachieve a deceleration during impact of 50g. This ensured that the attenuation material\nhad completely crushed during impact. Maximum crush displacement of the attenuation\nmaterial during impact was measured using a high-speed camera. As with quasi-static\ntests, dynamic crush efficiency was then determined by taking the ratio of crush\ndisplacement to initial cushion thickness.\n4.1.3. Calibration and Error Mitigation\nThe high speed camera was calibrated before each testing session by placing a\nruler within the camera's field of view to calibrate the camera software's distance and\nvelocity tracking modes. Sampling pictures at 2000Hz and confirming impact velocity\nafter each drop-test mitigated error propagation.\n\n4.1.4. Test Matrices\nThe original test matrices developed for this experiment only planned to evaluate\nstatic and dynamic crush efficiency for one thickness. However, during the course of\ntesting for honeycomb, a slight discrepancy between quasi-static and dynamic test results\nindicated that crush efficiency may be a function of initial cushion thickness. Thus, the\nquasi-static test matrices were expanded for both attenuation materials to characterize a\ndependence on initial cushion thickness. Unfortunately, the dynamic test matrices could\nnot be expanded to measure crush efficiencies of cushion thickness greater than 1⁄2-inch\ndue to a maximum achievable impact velocity of 13.5 feet per second.\nQuasi-static crush efficiency for honeycomb was tested for thicknesses of 1⁄2, 3⁄4\nand 1 inch thick samples. While testing three or more different thickness to characterize\nexpanding foam crush efficiency would have been ideal, mechanical problems with the\nInstron machine constrained data collection. Ultimately, successful quasi-static tests were\nconducted for two thicknesses of expanding foam, 1⁄2 inch and 1 inch.\nTest matrices used for measuring static and dynamic crush efficiencies are shown\nin Tables 1 and 2 respectively. Quasi-static and dynamic crush efficiencies were\nmeasured using the same parameters of attenuation material cushion thickness; the same\nindependent variables of material and trial number, and the same dependent variable of\nmaterial crush displacement.\n\nTable 1: Quasi-Static Crush Efficiency Test Matrices\n\nTable 2: Dynamic Crush Efficiency Test Matrix\n\n4.2. Safety Margin\n4.2.1. Scope\nThe purpose of characterizing a safety margin is to account for the effect of\nvariations in material properties when determining the necessary pre-deployment volume\nof an impact attenuator. The tests conducted in this experiment are meant to characterize\nthe variation in material properties of honeycomb and expanding foam under the specific\ntest conditions of 13.5 foot per second impact velocity and 50g impact shock limit. While\n\nslight variations in these test conditions are likely to yield a similar safety margin to the\none characterized in this experiment, more testing must be conducted to determine if this\nsafety margin applies to a wide range of test conditions.\n4.2.2. Methods\nSafety margins for honeycomb and expanding foam were characterized by\nconducting drop-tests using marginal cushion dimensions derived from equations\nmodeling the behavior of the impact attenuators during crush. The equations modeling\npaper honeycomb are,\nη\nν\nτ\ngG\nfinal\n=\n,\n(Eq. 2)\nand,\nmGg\nA\ncrush =\nσ\n,\n(Eq. 3)\nwhere impact velocity (v) is 13.5 feet per second, (g) is 32.2 feet per second, (G) is the\ndeceleration requirement of 50, (η ) is the crush efficiency for the attenuation material\nbeing tested, (\nfinal\nτ\n) is the cushion thickness, (A) is the base area of the cushion, and (m)\nis the mass of the payload. However, experiment results indicated that these equations are\nnot a good model for expanding foam. The equations used to model expanding foam are\ndiscussed further in the Section 6.4.1.\nTwenty-five drop-tests for each material were conducted using marginal cushion\ndimensions and yielded a distribution of peak accelerations experienced by the payload\nduring impact. From this distribution, new cushion dimensions were chosen to protect the\npayload within two standard deviations from 50g. These dimensions were found by\nsolving Equations 2 and 3 using the peak acceleration two standard deviations below the\n50g impact shock limit.\n4.2.3. Calibration and Error Mitigation\nMuch care was taken to mitigate error during the safety margin drop-tests.\nAcceleration was sampled at 5000 Hz to avoid aliasing. The high-speed camera was\ncalibrated before each drop-test session, and used to confirm that impact velocity was\nwithin 0.3 feet per second of 13.5 feet per second. Also, the box was leveled before each\n\ndrop test to avoid tilt during impact. High-speed camera images were also used to\ndetermine if the box tilted during impact.\n4.2.4. Test Matrix\nWhile conducting drop-tests to determine an appropriate safety margin for\ncushion thickness, the parameters included a fixed height to achieve the desired impact\nvelocity, and the marginal cushion dimensions for each material. The independent\nvariables were material and trial number, and the dependent variable to be measured was\nmaximum acceleration during impact. The test matrix for safety margin calculations is\nshown in Table 3.\n\nTable 3: Safety Margin Test Matrix\n\n4.3. Volume\n4.3.1. Scope\nThe purpose of this measurement is to determine the pre-deployment volume\nnecessary, including safety margin, to protect an 11.5-pound payload with a vertical\ndescent rate of 13.5 feet per second from a 50g impact shock limit.\n4.3.2. Methods\nThe new cushion areas and thicknesses chosen using the safety margin\ndistribution give a measure of the attenuator volume after deployment. Since the volume\nof honeycomb does not change during deployment, the volume after deployment is also\nthe pre-deployment volume. However, the pre-deployment volume of expanding foam is\ngiven by the amount of unexpanded foam necessary to achieve the appropriate attenuator\nvolume after deployment. The pre-deployment volume of expanding foam was given by,\n\nanded\ndeployment\nafter\nef\nanded\nun\ndeployment\npre\nef\nb\nV\nb\nV\nexp\n_\nexp\n=\n-\n,\n(Eq. 4)\n\nwhere\nis the pre-deployment volume of the expanding foam,\n\nis the attenuator volume after deployment calculated using the safety margin distribution,\nis the volume of an unexpanded bag of expanding foam, and\nis the\nexpected volume of an expanded bag of foam.\ndeployment\npre\nef\nV\n-\ndeployment\nafter\nef\nV\n_\nanded\nun\nb\nexp\nanded\nbexp\n4.3.3. Calibration and Error Mitigation\nMuch of the error in volume measurements are associated with the propagation of\nerror in previous tests, as discussed in the error analysis. Calibration and error mitigation\nof these tests are discussed in previous sections.\n4.3.4. Test Matrix\nThe pre-deployment volume for honeycomb is evaluated rather than found\nempirically, and thus is not included in the test matrix. In conducting a test to calculate\npre-deployment volume for expanding foam, the independent variable is number of trials.\nThe dependent variable is the volume of water displaced by one unexpanded foam bag.\nThe test matrix for volume measurements is shown in Table 4.\n\nTable 4: Volume Test Matrix\n\n4.4. Foam Expansion Reliability\n4.4.1. Scope\nThis test gives a measure of the reliability with which expanding foam will\nachieve the expected volume specified by the manufacturer within thirty seconds. In this\nexperiment, foam was slowly warmed using the Instapak Quick Warmer. Foam\nexpansion was then manually activated. Warming foam using a device other than\n\nsupplied by Instapak may result in a different reliability. Also, this test does not take into\naccount the reliability of a deployment mechanism to activate foam expansion.\n4.4.2. Methods\nEach time a bag of foam was expanded for use in safety margin trials, data was\nrecorded indicating whether the bag successfully expanded to the expected volume within\nthirty seconds. The expected volume for one expanded bag of foam, as specified by the\nmanufacturer, is 180 cubic inches.\n4.4.3. Calibration and Error Mitigation\nAn attempt was made to control the method with which foam was expanded, in\norder to reduce the effects of outside factors when quantifying foam expansion reliability.\nFoam was expanded using a consistent method for manually triggering foam expansion.\nAlso, foam was expanded within a barrier constraining area. Finally, all tests were\nconducted at room temperature and ambient pressure.\n4.4.4. Test Matrix\nThe test matrix for foam expansion reliability is shown in Table 5. The\nindependent variable is trial number, and the dependent variable is a Boolean true or false\nstatement for the successful expansion to a cushion volume greater or equal to the\nexpected volume in less than thirty seconds.\nTable 5: Foam Expansion Reliability Test Matrix\n\n5. Results\n\nThe experiment objective involved evaluating expanding foam as an impact\nattenuation material by comparing several parameters of expanding foam to paper\nhoneycomb. The results displayed in Figure 9 show crush efficiency, pre-deployment\nvolume and expansion reliability of foam as a percent of the same parameters for paper\nhoneycomb. Note that, as stated in the project objective, these results are valid for a\n\nscenario where a payload falling at 13.5 feet per second is protected with a safety margin\nfrom an impact shock above 50g.\n\nEF parameters as compared to HC\n0%\n20%\n40%\n60%\n80%\n100%\nEfficiency\nPre-Deployment Volume\nMaterial Reliability\n% difference\nEF\nHypothesis True\nEF parameters as compared to HC\n0%\n20%\n40%\n60%\n80%\n100%\nEfficiency\nPre-Deployment Volume\nMaterial Reliability\n% difference\nEF\nHypothesis True\n\nFigure 9: Results of Expanding Foam Comparison to Paper Honeycomb\n\nThe dashed boxes in Figure 9 show the range of the hypothesized values for each\nparameter. The uncertainties associated with the values of crush efficiency and pre-\ndeployment volume, which are discussed in Section 6.7, are depicted by error bars. The\nresults for foam expansion reliability were found with 95% confidence.\nIt can be seen from this chart that the hypotheses regarding attenuator efficiency\nand deployment reliability were assessed within experimental error; however, the\nhypothesis regarding pre-deployment volume could not be proved or disproved. This\nexperiment confirmed that the crush efficiency of expanding foam is at least 70% of the\ncrush efficiency of paper honeycomb, and disproved the hypothesis that the foam\nexpansion reliability is at least 90%.\n\nOverall these results show that, for the scope of this experiment,\n- The crush efficiency of expanding foam is at least 72.7% of the crush\nefficiency of paper honeycomb\n- The pre-deployment volume of expanding foam is at most 33.6% the pre-\ndeployment volume of paper honeycomb\n\n- The expanding foam is 83% reliable, with 95% confidence, to expand to its\nexpected volume within 30 seconds.\n\n6. Analysis of Results\n\n6.1. Analysis of Honeycomb Crush Efficiency Tests\n6.1.1. Data Reduction\nCrush thickness efficiencies for both honeycomb and expanding foam were\nderived from the results of quasi-static tests at TELAC and dynamic tests conducted\nusing the drop-test rig. Initial cushion thickness and maximum crush displacement were\ninput into Equation 1 to find the material crush efficiency. The maximum crush\ndisplacement was found from the quasi-static stress versus displacement plots as shown\nfor a sample tested in Figure 10, and it was directly observed through the high speed\ncamera for the dynamic tests.\n\nFigure 10:Example of Maximum Crush Displacement\n\nFor paper honeycomb, five 1⁄2-inch, 3⁄4-inch and 1-inch thick samples were tested\nat TELAC; while only 1⁄2-inch thick samples were tested at the drop-test rig because no\nhigher impact velocities could be met such as to ensure that a thicker sample would be\ncrushed completely.\n6.1.2. Discussion of Results\nFigure 11 shows the honeycomb crush efficiency results.

The sliced samples were therefore considered fair test\nspecimens and used as needed during the experiment. It is also important to note that\nsince the quasi-static and dynamic test results are consistent, velocity dependent\nattenuation characteristics were discounted.\n6.1.3. Crush Thickness Efficiency\nThe purpose of quantifying crush efficiency is to determine the final cushion\nthickness necessary to protect a payload with the specified vertical descent rate and\nimpact shock limit. While tests showed that crush efficiency is a function of thickness,\nthe objective was particularly concerned with comparing the crush efficiency of\nexpanding foam to paper honeycomb for the cushion thickness dictated by the experiment\nconditions. In order to be consistent with this objective, it was observed that the final\ncushion thickness of honeycomb needed to prevent impact shock above 50g is 2.7 inches,\nas evaluated in final volume calculations. This would require stacking three 1-inch thick\nsamples of honeycomb together, for which the crush thickness efficiency observed would\nbe that of the 1-inch thick samples. Therefore, the final value for honeycomb presented\nin the results in Section 3 was the average crush thickness efficiency of the five 1-inch\nthick samples tested at TELAC. This value is 86%.\n\n6.2. Analysis of Expanding Foam Crush Efficiency Tests\n6.2.1. Data Reduction\nQuasi-static and dynamic tests were also conducted to characterize the crush\nthickness efficiency of expanding foam. This time, five 1⁄2-inch and 1-inch thick samples\nwere tested at TELAC; and only 1⁄2-inch thick samples were tested at the drop-test rig.\nHowever, as will be discussed, it was noted that more crush efficiency measurements\nwould have been necessary to definitively characterize the trend for initial cushion\nthicknesses greater than one inch.\n6.2.2. Discussion of Results\nFigure 12 shows the quasi-static test results for expanding foam crush efficiency\nas a function of initial cushion thickness. The trend line fitting the quasi-static data for\n1/2 and 1-inch thick expanding foam reveals that crush efficiency is a function of initial\nthickness for the range of cushion thicknesses tested. Dynamic tests did not yield lower\ncrush efficiencies than measured during the quasi-static tests, so velocity dependent\nattenuation characteristics were discounted.\nEF Crush Efficiency\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n1.1\n0.5\n1.5\nSample Thickness (in)\nEta\nSamples\nLower Bounds\nUpper Bounds\nLinear\n(Samples)\nLinear (Lower\nBounds)\nLinear (Upper\nBounds)\nEF Crush Efficiency\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n1.1\n0.5\n1.5\nSample Thickness (in)\nEta\nSamples\nLower Bounds\nUpper Bounds\nLinear\n(Samples)\nLinear (Lower\nBounds)\nLinear (Upper\nBounds)\n\nFigure 12: Expanding Foam Crush Thickness Efficiency Results\n\n6.2.3. Crush Thickness Efficiency\nThe expanding foam crush efficiency value concerning this experiment is\ndependent on the final cushion thickness of material required to protect a payload with\nthe specified vertical descent rate and impact shock limit. The crush displacement\n\nnecessary to protect the payload under these conditions was found to be 1.81 inches. This\ncalculation is discussed further in Section 6.4. Because the trend line fitting data for\nexpanding foam crush efficiency as a function of cushion thickness cannot accurately be\nextended to this initial thickness, upper and lower bounds on crush efficiency were\nextrapolated. Fitting a trend line to the minimum crush efficiency value at 1⁄2-inch and the\nmaximum crush efficiency value at 1-inch created the upper bound. Fitting a trend line to\nthe maximum crush efficiency value at 1⁄2-inch and the minimum crush efficiency value at\n1-inch created the lower bound.\nThe lower bound was used to approximate a conservative estimate for crush\nefficiency which underestimates the expanding foam's true efficiency at this thickness.\nThis step was necessary because no data was collected for larger cushion thicknesses.\nUnderestimating crush efficiency yields an overestimate for cushion thickness, which\nresults in a conservative estimate for pre-deployment volume. Also, extra cushion\nthickness does not affect the acceleration experienced by the payload during impact since\nthe cushion thickness must be equal to or greater than the crush displacement necessary\nto slow down the payload. The final result for expanding foam crush thickness efficiency\nwas thus calculated to 72%.\n6.3. Analysis of Paper Honeycomb Safety Margin Tests\n6.3.1. Data Reduction\nDuring the safety margin tests, the payload was dropped multiple times and its\nacceleration as a function of time was recorded during impact. Twenty five test drops for\nwhich the impact velocity was confirmed to be 13.5 ± 0.3 feet per second were analyzed.\nTests were carried out using an 11.5 pound payload cushioned by 1-inch thick\nhoneycomb with an area of 56 square inches. The accelerometer data for the three\nCartesian axes were combined in order to determine the peak absolute acceleration\nexperienced by the payload during impact. Peak accelerations were then plotted as a\ndistribution shown in Figure 13.\n\nHoneycomb Distribution of Primary Peak Accelerations\nPrimary Peak Acceleration (G)\nNumber of Trials\nMean Peak Acceleration: 83.6 G\nStandard Deviation: 20.6 G\n\nFigure 13: Honeycomb Distribution of Peak Accelerations\n\nThe safety margin, defined for the purposes of this experiment as two standard deviations\nof this distribution, was 41.2g.\nThe Matlab code used to reduce this data can be found in Appendix B.\n6.3.2. Data Filtering\nThe accelerometer data was filtered before being reduced because it showed high\nfrequency vibrations of amplitudes as high as 200g and periods around 1 millisecond, as\nshown in Figure 14. After a conversation with Professor John Deyst1, it was\nhypothesized that the high frequency data reflected some type of resonance associated\nwith the crushing honeycomb that was left uncharacterized. This resonance was filtered\nout because it showed very high accelerations that are not associated with the frequency\nof impact shock of the physical process this experiment was concerned with.\n\n1 Conversation with Professor John Deyst, November 20, 2003\n\n0.002\n0.004\n0.006\n0.008\n0.01\n0.012\n0.014\n0.016\n-150\n-100\n-50\nSample HC Safety Margin Trial\nTime (s)\nAcceleration (G)\nRaw Data\nFiltered Data\n\nFigure 14: Sample of Filtered Honeycomb Safety Margin Trial\n\nData was filtered using a low-pass Butterworth filter with a cut-off frequency of\n580 Hz. Matlab code for this filter can be found in Appendix B. This cut-off frequency\nwas chosen such that the peak due to buckling seen in the safety margin test data was\nconsistent with the peak stress during seen in the quasi-static loading data obtained at\nTELAC.\n6.3.3. Discussion of Results: Comparison to Previous Theory\n\nSafety margin tests were conducted using parameters that were expected to yield a\npeak distribution with a mean of 50g. As can be seen in Figure 13, the mean peak\nacceleration was much higher at 83.6g.\nThis phenomenon can be explained by observing filtered acceleration during\nimpact for each drop-test, which is shown as the bold line in Figure 14. This data reveals\ntwo dominant loading modes during impact: the primary peak, which rises up to 95g for\nthis sample, is due to buckling before the honeycomb cells start to collapse; the following\npeaks of about 50g occur as the cells are collapsing and the material is said to \"crush\".\nThe model used predicted the behavior of honeycomb during crush, but it failed to\npredict the high peaks observed during buckling. This is because the parameters for the\nsafety margin tests were calculated using Equation 3 and the average value of crush stress\nfor all trials, 10.4 pounds per square inch. The plateau, shown in Figure 15, represents the\naverage crush stress for one trial.\n\nSample 1\" HC Static Test Trial\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\nDisplacement (in)\nCrush Stress (psi)\ncritical buckling stress\naverage crush stress\n\nFigure 15: Sample of 1-Inch Honeycomb Quasi-Static Loading Test\n\nThis value is the stress on honeycomb as it crushes and after the cells have collapsed. In\nfact, the mean of the distribution of the secondary peaks in the acceleration versus time\nplots, which is shown in Figure 16, was within experimental error of 50g, which is the\nvalue predicted by our theoretical model.\nHoneycomb Distribution of Secondary Peak Accelerations\nSeconday Peak Acceleration (G)\nNumber of Trials\nMean Peak Acceleration: 59.0 G\nStandard Deviation: 8.0 G\n\nFigure 16: Honeycomb Distribution of Secondary Peak Accelerations\n\nHowever, since the purpose of impact attenuation is to reduce the highest\nacceleration during impact, the theoretical model was changed to predict buckling rather\nthan crush. The implication of this change is that the stress value used in Equation 3 is\nnow the critical buckling stress rather than the average crush stress. This value, which\ncan also be extracted from quasi-static load test data, corresponds to the initial stress peak\nbefore the plateau as seen in Figure 15.\n\nThe validity of this modification was readily confirmed by rearranging Equation 3\nto find maximum acceleration as a function of buckling stress and the actual parameters\n\n(impact area and payload mass) for which the test was performed. The value of stress\ninput to the equation, 16.4 pounds per square inch, was the average of the critical\nbuckling stresses (as defined above) of the five quasi-static load tests done on 1-inch\nthick honeycomb samples. The acceleration predicted this time by our model was 79.1g,\nwhich matches the mean of the primary peak distribution in Figure 13 within\nexperimental error.\n6.3.4. Safety Margin\n\nThe spread of the distribution corresponding to the peak accelerations during\nbuckling was used to characterize a safety margin which would protect a payload from a\n50g impact shock limit. The spread corresponding to two standard deviations of the\ndistribution is primarily due to variations in material properties from sample to sample\nrather than error in impact velocity; this is discussed in more detail in Section 6.7. For\nhoneycomb buckling, two standard deviations was found to be 42.1g. The material\nproperties of honeycomb are not expected to vary greatly whether it is being used to\nprotect a payload from a 50g or 79.1g impact shock limit, especially since the amount\nmaterial needed for the two shock limits does not differ greatly. Thus the safety margin\ntrials provide an adequate measurement of the safety margin necessary to protect at\npayload with a 50g impact shock limit to within two standard deviations of the peak\nacceleration distribution.\n6.4. Analysis of Expanding Foam Safety Margin Tests\n6.4.1. Analysis of Expanding Foam Crush Stress: Comparison to Previous\nTheory\nWhile designing the experiment, expanding foam behavior had been modeled as\nAnderson modeled paper honeycomb. This model assumed a constant crush stress during\ncrush, and yielded Equation 2 and Equation 3- two decoupled equations governing\ncushion thickness, cushion area, and acceleration experienced during impact. However,\nquasi-static tests to quantify expanding foam crush efficiency revealed an interesting and\nunexpected result: the crush stress of expanding foam during crush is not constant, but is\nbetter approximated by a linear function. A graph of crush stress versus crush\ndisplacement in shown in Figure 17 below.\n\nSample 1\" EF Static Test Trial\ny = 4.077x - 0.0009\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\nDisplacement (in)\nCrush Stress (psi)\nActual\nCrush\nModelled\nBehavior\nLinear\n(Modelled\nBehavior)\n\nFigure 17: Sample of 1-Inch Quasi-static Loading Test\n\nModeling expanding foam more accurately as a linear function results in an\nordinary differential equation which couples cushion thickness, cushion area, and\nacceleration experienced during impact. This differential equation is of the form,\n=\n+\nx\nm\nkA\nx&&\n,\n(Eq.5)\nwhere (x) is the displacement during crush, (k) is the slope of the crush stress during\ncrush displacement, (A) is the area of the cushion sample, and (m) is the mass of the\npayload.\nThis differential equation yields a solution of the form,\n)\nsin(\n)\n(\nt\nm\nkA\nC\nt\nx\n=\n,\n(Eq. 6)\nwhere (C) is an unknown constant representing maximum displacement during crush.\nUsing this form, a relationship between cushion thickness and area can be found by\ntaking the first and second derivatives, and solving for the maximum displacement during\ncrush using impact velocity and the maximum acceleration experienced during impact.\nThe expanding foam initial cushion thickness used to conduct the safety margin tests is\nthen found by dividing the maximum displacement during impact by crush efficiency.\n6.4.2. Data Reduction\nAs with paper honeycomb, the accelerometer data for the three Cartesian axes\nwere combined in order to determine the peak absolute acceleration experienced by the\npayload during impact. Expanding foam safety margin tests were conducted using the\nimproved model described in Equation 5, which approximated expanding foam crush\nstress as a linear function of crush displacement. Tests were carried out using an 11.5\n\npound payload cushioned by 1.81 inch thick expanding foam with an area of 168 square\ninches. These trials yielded the distribution of peak accelerations shown in Figure 18. The\nmean of this distribution is 62.2g.\nExpanding Foam Distribution of Peak Accelerations\nPeak Accleration (G)\nNumber of Trials\nMean Peak Acceleration: 62.2 G\nStandard Deviation: 6.7 G\n\nFigure 18: Expanding Foam Distribution of Peak Accelerations\n\n6.4.3. Discussion of Results\nWhile gathering expanding foam safety margin data, observations indicated that\nmost peak accelerations were slightly above the expected 50g; however the results did\nnot seem unreasonable. Later, however, investigation revealed that two parameter errors\nin our model explained the 12g bias. First, the mass of our payload was specified in\nNewtons rather than kilograms. Second, the quasi-static data set that was originally used\nto estimate the slope of the crush stress during crush displacement was erroneous. The\ndata set was determined to be erroneous by comparing the forces exerted by the Instron\nmachine on the expanding foam in this data set and noting a discrepancy when compared\nto other subsequently collected expanding foam quasi-static data sets and previously\ncollected honeycomb quasi-static data sets.\n\nInterestingly, either one of these parameter errors alone would have resulted in\nunreasonable peak accelerations during impact and would have immediately flagged an\nerror in the model. For example, the error in mass alone would have resulted in a mean\npeak acceleration of approximately 21g, while the error in the quasi-static data would\nhave resulted in a mean peak acceleration of approximately 159g. It appears that these\n\ntwo errors combined to produce reasonable peak accelerations during safety margin trials.\nWhen correcting these two parameter errors, inputting the cushion area and thickness\nused during the safety margin trials, and solving Equation X for peak acceleration, our\nmodel yields a mean peak acceleration of 67.0g. This predicted mean is within\nexperimental error of the 62.2g mean found in our safety margin test. Thus, the model of\nexpanding foam is successful at predicting the mean of the peak acceleration distribution.\n6.4.4. Safety Margin\n\nDespite that the distribution of peak accelerations was not centered about 50g, the\nspread of the distribution was used to characterize a safety margin which would protect a\npayload from a 50g impact shock limit. This is because the spread corresponding to two\nstandard deviations of the distribution is primarily due to variations in material properties\nfrom sample to sample rather than error in impact velocity; this is discussed in more\ndetail in Section 6.7. The value of two standard deviations was found to be 13.4g. The\nmaterial properties of expanding foam are not expected to vary whether it is being used to\nprotect a payload from a 50g or 62.2g impact shock limit, especially since the amount of\nexpanding foam needed for the two shock limits does not differ greatly. Thus the safety\nmargin trials provide an adequate measurement of the safety margin necessary to protect\nat payload with a 50g impact shock limit to within two standard deviations of the peak\nacceleration distribution.\n6.5. Volume Calculation\n6.5.1. Paper Honeycomb\nA final cushion volume including safety margin was calculated by using an\nimpact acceleration two standard deviations below the impact shock limit of 50g. In this\ncase an impact shock limit of 8.8g was used to solve Equation 3 to determine the base\narea of paper honeycomb required to protect a payload with an impact shock limit of 50g\ngiven a payload mass of 11.5 pounds and a material critical buckling stress of 16.4\npounds per square inch. Equation 2 was then used to determine cushion thickness using\nthe calculated cushion area, an impact velocity of 13.5 feet per second, the crush\nthickness efficiency of the 1-inch thick samples of honeycomb, and the 8.8g impact\nshock limit. Using this cushion area and thickness ensure that, 95% of the time, the\nmaterial adequately protects a payload with a 50g impact shock limit. Note that the\n\nconfidence factor was provided by the safety margin incorporated to this equation, as\nshown in Appendix C. The final cushion volume of honeycomb needed was found to be\n27.2 cubic inches.\n6.5.2. Expanding Foam\nA final cushion volume including safety margin was calculated by using an\nimpact acceleration two standard deviations below the impact shock limit of 50g. In this\ncase an impact shock limit of 36.6g was used to solve Equation 5 for a cushion area,\nthickness, and thus volume. This volume was then scaled to a pre-deployment volume\nbased on the volume of an unexpanded Instapak bag using Equation 4. This analysis\nconcluded that, including safety margin, an expanding foam pre-deployment volume of\n7.1 cubic inches is necessary to protect a payload from a 50g impact shock limit.\n6.6. Expanding Foam Reliability Tests\nOut of the twenty five bags of foam expanded for these tests, only one bag\nexpanded to a volume below that expected according to the product specifications. All\nbags expanded fully within thirty seconds of the chemical mixing. Larson's binomial\ndistribution nomograph2 was used to plot these results and foam expansion reliability of\n83% was found with 95% confidence.\n6.7. Error Analysis\nThe purpose of this analysis is to quantify the error in the measurements of crush\ndisplacement efficiency and pre-deployment attenuator volume used to assess our crush\nefficiency, volume, and reliability hypotheses.\n6.7.1. Quasi-Static Crush Efficiency Error\n\nAs discussed in data analysis, dynamic crush efficiencies were not used in\nthe experiment analysis. Thus, these errors do not contribute to the experiment error and\nare not analyzed in this section.\nCrush displacement measurements using an Instron force press are accurate to\nwithin 0.01 inches. However, another source of error in measuring crush displacement is\nthe ability to accurately determine the point of inflection in the force versus displacement\ncurve generated by the Instron machine. The error for estimating the inflection point is at\nmost 0.04 inches for honeycomb and at most 0.06 inches for expanding foam. Initial\n\n2 Presented in lecture by Professor John Deyst, November 30, 2003\n\ncushion thickness is measured using a standard ruler with accuracy conservatively\nestimated to within one-sixteenth of an inch.\nGiven the equation for crush efficiency (Eq.1) and the general rule for\ncombination of errors:\n...\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\ndx\nx\nF\ndx\nx\nF\ndx\nx\nF\ndz\nδ\nδ\nδ\nδ\nδ\nδ\n+\n+\n=\n,\n(Eq. 7)\nwhere\nthe error in crush efficiency is given by:\n...)\n,\n,\n(\nx\nx\nx\nF\nz =\n)\n(\n)\n(\n*\nτ\nτ\nη\nη\nd\nx\nx\nd\nd\n+\n=\n.\n(Eq. 8)\nThe combined error in honeycomb crush displacement (dx) is 0.041 inches. The\ninitial honeycomb cushion thickness (τ ) chosen for our experimental parameters was\nmeasured to be 0.946 inches, with an average crush displacement (x) of 0.816 inches.\nUsing these values, Equation (8) yields an error for honeycomb quasi-static crush\nefficiency of 7.4 %.\nThe combined error in expanding foam crush displacement (dx) is 0.061 inches.\nThe initial expanding foam cushion thickness (τ ) chosen for our experimental\nparameters was measured to be 2.5 inches, with a crush displacement (x) of 1.81 inches.\nThese values yield an error in expanding foam crush efficiency of 4.2%.\nThe errors in honeycomb and expanding foam crush efficiency were then\nnormalized to the crush efficiency of honeycomb in order to assess the hypothesis. This\nnormalization resulted in a lower error bound of -11.1% for expanding foam crush\nefficiency as compared to honeycomb crush efficiency. Because data analysis resulted\nonly in a lower bound on expanding foam crush efficiency, an upper error bound was not\nquantified.\n6.7.2. Pre-deployment Attenuator Volume\n6.7.2.1.Peak Acceleration Error\nErrors in peak acceleration measurements are due to a random accelerometer error\nand a random error in impact velocity. The peak acceleration measurement error can be\nused to interpret the experimental data in two ways. First, the error can be used to\ndetermine if the mean of the peak acceleration distribution is centered about the expected\nmean within experimental error. Second, peak acceleration error is propagated to\n\ndetermine errors in initial cushion thickness, cushion area, and ultimately cushion\nvolume.\nFor safety margin trials, initial honeycomb cushion thickness was slightly\noverestimated, and initial expanding foam cushion thickness was slightly overestimated\nindirectly by underestimating crush efficiency. Because extra cushion thickness does not\naffect acceleration experienced by the payload during impact, errors in initial cushion\nthickness and crush efficiency for expanding foam do not affect the errors in peak\nacceleration measurements. However, errors in crush efficiency, initial cushion thickness,\nimpact velocity and peak acceleration measurements all contribute to error in pre-\ndeployment volume.\nPeak acceleration is measured using a Crossbow Accelerometer series\nCXL100HF3. According to the product specification sheet, the input range is +/- 100g\nand the sensitivity is +/- 10 millivolts per g. According the specification footnote, this\ncorresponds to a +/- 2% error in the accelerometer measurement. Operating near and\naround the impact deceleration limit of 50G, this causes a 1G random measurement error.\nThe experiment was conducted assuming an impact velocity of 13.5 feet per\nsecond. Impact velocity was confirmed after each drop-test using a high-speed camera\nsampling at 1000 frames per second and was found to vary by plus or minus 0.3 feet per\nsecond. The instrument error associated with measuring impact velocity with a high\nspeed camera sampling at 1000 frames per second is calculated to be 0.39 feet per\nsecond. The general rule for combination of errors yields a total error in impact velocity\nof 0.49 feet per second. The error in peak acceleration measurement due to the total error\nin impact velocity is given by:\n\n2)\n(\ndv\nv\ndG\nfinal\nητ\n=\n,\n(Eq. 9)\nwhere (v) is the average impact velocity of 13.5 feet per second, (dv) is the error in\nimpact velocity, (η ) is the crush efficiency, and (\nfinal\nτ\n) is the final cushion thickness.\nUsing the crush efficiency and initial cushion thickness calculated for honeycomb, the\nerror in peak accelerations for honeycomb due to impact velocity error is 8.99g.\nSimilarly, using the crush efficiency and initial cushion thickness calculated for\n\nexpanding foam, the error in peak accelerations for expanding foam due to impact\nvelocity error is 5.01g.\nCombining the errors due to the accelerometer measurement and variation in\ndrop-height using the general rule for combination of errors yields an equation for the\ntotal error in peak acceleration measurements:\nheight\ndrop\nter\naccelerome\nrandom\nd\nd\ndG\n-\n+\n=\n.\n(Eq. 10)\nUsing Equation (10) yields a total error in peak acceleration measurements for\nhoneycomb of 9.05g, and a total error in peak acceleration measurements for expanding\nfoam of 5.12g.\n6.7.2.2.Error in Cushion Dimensions\nHoneycomb\nFinal honeycomb cushion thickness is calculated using the equation:\nη\nτ\ngG\nv\nfinal\n=\n,\n(Eq. 11)\nwhere (v) is the impact velocity requirement, and (G) is the impact shock limit including\nsafety margin, and (η ) is the crush efficiency, and (\nfinal\nτ\n) is the cushion thickness\nincluding safety margin to protect the payload from accelerations greater than 50g during\nimpact. Using the general rule for combination of errors, the error in the final cushion\nthickness as a function of the error in crush efficiency and the error in (\n) is given by\nG\n))\n(\n(\n)\n)\n(\n(\nη\nη\nη\nτ\nd\nG\ng\nv\ndG\nG\ng\nv\nd\nfinal\n+\n=\n,\n(Eq. 12)\nwhere (\n) is the error in peak acceleration measurements and (\ndG\nη\nd\n) is the error in crush\nefficiency. For honeycomb, this yields an error in final cushion thickness of 0.30 inches.\n\nHoneycomb final area is calculated using the following,\nmGg\nA\ncrush =\nσ\n,\n(Eq. 13)\nwhere (m) is the mass of the payload, (G) is the impact shock limit including safety\nmargin, (g) is the acceleration due to gravity, and (A) is the base area of the honeycomb.\nUsing the general rule for combination of errors, the error in the final cushion area as a\nfunction of the error in (G ) is given by,\n\ncrush\ndG\ng\nm\ndA\nσ\n=\n.\n(Eq. 14)\nEquation 14 yields an error in cushion area of 0.06 square inches.\nThe pre-deployment volume for the honeycomb impact attenuation material is\nthen given by:\nfinal\nhoneycomb\nA\nV\nτ\n=\n.\n(Eq. 15)\nUsing the general rule for combination of errors, the error in the final cushion volume as\na function of the error in thickness and the error in area is given by:\ndA\nd\nA\ndV\nfinal\nfinal\nhoneycomb\nτ\nτ\n+\n=\n.\n(Eq. 16)\nwhere cushion area (\n) is 6.17 square inches and cushion thickness (\nA\nfinal\nτ\n) is 3 inches as\nwas found in the data analysis. The errors in cushion area and thickness yield an error in\nvolume of 2.87 cubic inches, which is an 11% error in the volume of honeycomb.\n\nExpanding Foam\n\nExpressions relating expanding foam area and cushion thickness, found by\nsolving the differential Equation 5 as described in the data analysis, are expressed below:\nkv\ng\nmG\nA =\n,\n(Eq. 17)\nand,\nη\nτ\n/\n/\n/\nA\nk\nvm\nfinal =\n,\n(Eq. 18)\nwhere (k) is the estimated slope of the crush stress, (m) is the mass of the payload, (G) is\nthe impact shock limit including safety margin, (η ) is the crush efficiency, and (v) is the\nimpact velocity.\nUsing the general rule for combination of errors, the error in the final cushion area\nas a function of the error in velocity and the error in (\n) is given by:\nG\ndV\nkv\ng\nmG\ndG\nkv\nmGg\ndA\n⎟⎟\n⎠\n⎞\n⎜⎜\n⎝\n⎛\n+\n⎟⎟\n⎠\n⎞\n⎜⎜\n⎝\n⎛\n=\n,\n(Eq. 19)\n\nIncluding errors in peak acceleration measurements and impact velocity, the error in\ncushion area is 0.0003 square inches.\n\nThe error in final cushion thickness as a function of errors in velocity and cushion\narea is given by,\n5.0\ndA\nk\nmA\nv\ndv\nkA\nm\nd\nfinal\n+\n=\nτ\n,\n(Eq. 20)\nand yields a 0.3 inch error in cushion thickness.\nAs with honeycomb, the error in the final cushion volume as a function of the\nerror in thickness and the error in area is given by:\n_\nexp\ndA\nd\nA\ndV\nfinal\nfinal\nfoam\nanding\nτ\nτ\n+\n=\n.\n(Eq. 21)\nwhere cushion area (\n) is 48.83 square inches and cushion thickness (\nA\nfinal\nτ\n) is 2.5\ninches as was found in the data analysis. Including the errors in cushion area and\nthickness yield an error in volume of 14.64 cubic inches, which is a 12.1 % error in the\nvolume of expanding foam. The same percent error value applies to the pre-deployment\nvolume of expanding foam required, which is scaled down linearly.\n\nThe errors in honeycomb and expanding foam pre-deployment volume were then\nnormalized to the honeycomb pre-deployment volume in order to assess the hypothesis.\nThis normalization resulted in a lower error bound of -5.4% and an upper error bound of\n+7.5% for expanding foam pre-deployment volume as compared to honeycomb pre-\ndeployment volume.\n6.8. Relation of Results to Hypothesis\n6.8.1. Crush Efficiency\nFor the scope of this test, an expanding foam crush efficiency of 0.72 was\ncompared to a honeycomb crush efficiency of 0.86. The crush efficiency of expanding\nfoam was found to be 83.8% of the crush efficiency of honeycomb. The errors in\nexpanding foam and honeycomb crush efficiencies, normalized to the crush efficiency of\nhoneycomb, resulted in a lower error bound of -11.1 % on expanding foam crush\nefficiency as compared to honeycomb crush efficiency. These results proved the\nhypothesis stating the crush efficiency of expanding foam is no less than 70% of the\ncrush efficiency of honeycomb.\n\n6.8.2. Pre-deployment Volume\nFor the scope of this test, an expanding foam pre-deployment volume of 7.11\ncubic inches was compared to a honeycomb pre-deployment volume of 27.2 cubic inches.\nThe pre-deployment of expanding foam was found to be 26.1% of the honeycomb pre-\ndeployment volume. The errors in pre-deployment volumes, normalized to the\nhoneycomb pre-deployment volume, resulted in an error of -5.4 %, +7.5 % on expanding\nfoam pre-deployment volume as compared to honeycomb pre-deployment volume. These\nerrors resulted in an uncertain assessment of the pre-deployment volume hypothesis.\n6.8.3. Foam Expansion Reliability\n\nFor the scope of this test, expanding foam was found to a foam expansion\nreliability of 83% with a 95% confidence. Thus, the hypothesis stating that expanding\nfoam had at least 90% reliability was disproved.\n\n7. Conclusions\n\n7.1. Assessment of Hypothesis\nThe hypotheses regarding attenuator efficiency and deployment reliability were\nassessed within experimental error; however, the hypothesis regarding pre-deployment\nvolume could not be proved or disproved. This experiment confirmed that the crush\nefficiency of expanding foam is at least 70% of the crush efficiency of paper honeycomb,\nand disproved the hypothesis that the foam expansion reliability is at least 90%.\n7.2. Other Findings\nThe results found regarding the hypotheses' metrics were:\n- The crush efficiency of expanding foam is at least 72.7% of the crush\nefficiency of paper honeycomb\n- The pre-deployment volume of expanding foam is at most 33.6% the pre-\ndeployment volume of paper honeycomb\n- The expanding foam is 83% reliable, with 95% confidence, to expand to its\nexpected volume within 30 seconds.\nOther results not directly related to the initial hypotheses included:\n- Honeycomb crush efficiency is a function of initial cushion thickness\n\n- Honeycomb buckling, rather than crush, results in peak accelerations\nexperienced by the payload during impact.\n- Expanding foam crush stress is not constant during crush displacement, and\ncan be accurately characterized using a linear approximation with positive\nslope.\n- Figure 19 shows that for a given payload mass, impact velocity, and\nappropriate crush stress characterization:\nPre-Deployment Volume of Attenuation Material vs.\nMaximum Acceleration During Impact\nMaximum Acceleration (G)\nVolume (in^3)\nExpanding\nFoam\nHoneycomb\n\nFigure 19: Pre-deployment Volume of Attenuation Material vs. Maximum\nAcceleration During Impact\n\no Honeycomb volume is constant for all maximum impact acceleration\nlimits. However areas and thicknesses necessary to protect the payload\ndo vary with maximum impact acceleration limits.\no Expanding foam volume is a linear function of maximum acceleration\nlimit.\n7.3. Suggestions for Future Work\nThis experiment formulated models for using honeycomb and expanding foam to\nprotect a payload from experiencing more than a 50g shock during impact within a safety\nmargin. However, due to time constraints, the final cushion dimensions for honeycomb\nand expanding foam resulting from this experiment were not tested to ensure they do\nindeed protect the payload adequately. The first recommendation for future work is to\nconduct drop tests to experimentally verify the results of this experiment. We also\nrecommend that the scope of this project be expanded to study other impact velocities\n\nand shock limit conditions to determine a range of conditions under which it is\nadvantageous to use one attenuation material over another. Finally, we recommend that\nfuture work include designing a reliable, low-volume, low-weight mechanism to expand\nfoam onboard an unmanned aerial vehicle.\n\n8. References\n\n1.

unmanned airplanes sometimes carry payloads to be released during\nflight. These payloads typically have a type of parachute to slow their descent, but often\na cushioning system is still necessary to avoid damaging the payload contents.\nCurrently, these payloads are cushioned with a type of cardboard honeycomb mainly\nbecause they are cheap and reliable. However, the cardboard honeycomb takes up a lot\nof room and the unmanned airplanes only have a limited amount of space to carry a\npayload. One solution to this problem may to be to use foam that expands after the\npayload has been released from the airplane. The purpose of this experiment is to test\nthe material properties of an expanding foam and assess whether the material is suitable\nfor cushioning a payload released from an unmanned airplane. Specifically, the\nexperiment will look at how well the expanding foam cushions and how much volume it\ntakes up in the unmanned airplane compared to cardboard honeycomb. These material\nproperties will be tested using a constructed drop-test rig and payload to simulate a\npayload falling from the airplane and hitting the ground. The tests will primary be\ncarried out in the Building 33 hangar and in TELAC, the advanced composites lab. The\nentire experiment, data analysis, and experiment report will require thirteen weeks to\ncarry out and cost $553.90. This experiment will serve as the foundation for designing\nan inexpensive and reliable payload cushioning system.\n\n1.0 Introduction\n\n1.1 Background and Motivation\nUnmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are remotely piloted or self-piloted aircraft\nthat can carry cameras, sensors, communications equipment or other payloads, and have\nbeen used in a reconnaissance and intelligence-gathering role since the 1950s. Delivery\nof small payloads is one of many concepts currently under development to enhance the\nfunctionality of UAVs. Small parafoils, deployed when payloads are released from\nUAVs, are a promising delivery method for such payloads and typically slow a\ndeployed payload's vertical descent rate to approximately 15 feet per second. A shock\nabsorption mechanism is then often necessary to attenuate the impact shock at\ntouchdown.\n\n1.2 Overview of Previous Work\nCurrent inexpensive and reliable low-impact attenuators such as paper\nhoneycomb and crushable foam occupy a significant fraction of the volumetric capacity\nof UAV payload compartments. Other existing impact attenuators such as deployable\nairbags and \"pull-up\" mechanisms occupy less pre-deployment UAV payload volume.\nHowever, they greatly compromise cost and/or reliability. A new impact attenuation\nconcept that reduces pre-deployment UAV payload volume without significantly\nincreasing cost or reducing reliability is desirable. An expanding foam impact\nattenuation (EFIA) device may serve this purpose.\n\n1.3 Short Overview of Project\n\nThe purpose of this project is to quantitatively compare the advantages and\ncompromises of an expanding foam impact attenuator to a honeycomb impact\nattenuator for the purpose of deploying small packages from UAVs. Specifically this\nproject will quantify pre-deployment volume, crush efficiency, reliability, and cost\nthrough static and dynamic testing.\n\n2.0 Hypothesis, Objectives, and Success Criteria\n\n2.1 Hypothesis\n\nThe primary hypothesis is that an expanding foam impact attenuation device\n(EFIA) will occupy at least 75% less pre-deployment value than paper honeycomb with\na crush thickness efficiency loss of no more than 30%. A secondary hypothesis is that\nother tradeoffs will not exceed an increase in cost of 50% and a decrease in reliability of\nno more than 10%.\n\n2.2 Objectives\n\nAssess the ability of an EFIA to protect a payload with a 50g impact shock\nresistance from a 15 ft/s vertical descent rate. This assessment will be conducted by\ncomparing the pre-deployment volume, crush efficiency, cost and reliability of the\nEFIA against paper honeycomb.\n\n2.3 Success Criteria\n\nEvaluate the aforementioned metrics for an EFIA and for paper honeycomb to\nan accuracy such that the hypotheses can be assessed.\n\n3.0 Experiment Overview\n\nTo accomplish the experiment objective, an expanding foam impact attenuator\n(EFIA) material will be tested using industrial packing and insulating materials. Paper\nhoneycomb impact attenuators will serve as the baseline for comparing the EFIA's\nperformance. A typical UAV payload may contain electronic equipment that is able to\nwithstand 50 times is own weight (50Gs) and occupies about 1 cubic foot. A drop-test\nrig approximately 6 feet in height will be built to simulate a parafoil-payload package\nvertical descent rate of 15 feet per second. The EFIA and the honeycomb impact\nattenuator will be compared on the following metrics: displacement crush efficiency,\ndeployment reliability, pre-deployment volume, and cost.\n\nThe displacement crush efficiency* is defined as the ratio of the crush\ndisplacement of the impact material to its cushion thickness before impact,\n\ncushion\ncrush\nt\nx\nτ\nη =\n.\n(Eq. 1)\nThis metric is important because payload volume must be reduced to compensate for\nthe extra attenuation material necessary to achieve the required cushion thickness before\nimpact. The displacement crush efficiency will be determined experimentally by\ndropping payloads of constant mass and constant base area protected by excess cushion\nthickness, and then measuring crush displacement. The result will be presented as a\npercent difference between the EFIA crush efficiency and honeycomb crush efficiency.\nPre-deployment volume is defined as the volume of the impact attenuation\nmaterial occupied inside the UAV payload compartment necessary to effectively\ncushion the payload from impact. Pre-deployment volume for EFIA and honeycomb\nwill include safety margins to reduce the effect of variations in material properties for\neach impact attenuation material. The result will be presented as a percent difference\nbetween pre-deployment volume for an EFIA and honeycomb impact attenuator.\n\nDeployment reliability is defined as the probability that an impact attenuator\nwill successfully deploy with the desired cushion thickness. Honeycomb does not\nrequire any deployment, and so reliability is taken to be 1. An expanding foam impact\nattenuator will be deployed 30 times. Cushion thickness and time to expand will be\nmeasured each trial and compared to the expected cushion thickness and time to\nexpand, resulting in a percent reliability. The result will be presented as a percent\nchange in reliability between an EFIA and honeycomb.\n\nCost for each impact attenuation device will be defined as the sum of the\noff-the-shelf pricing for each of the materials necessary to protect the given payload\nfrom a shock greater than 50Gs.\n\n* Definition taken from unpublished work by Chris Anderson entitled, \"Impact Shock Attenuation for\nParafoil Payloads\"\n\n4.0 Literature Review\n\nAlthough there does not appear to be previous research investigating the use of\nan expanding foam material to attenuate the impact of objects deployed from aerial\nvehicles, there is a great body of literature laying the foundation for such a research\nexperiment. This literature includes various experiments employing standard shock\nimpact testing methodologies, and one resource discussing the use of honeycomb\nmaterial to attenuate the impact of small payloads deployed from UAVs.\n\nThe paper entitled \"Design and Testing of the HOPE-X HSFD-II Landing\nSystem\" written by Gardiner1 discusses the design, analysis and preliminary testing of\nthe airbag impact attenuation system for the re-entry of the unmanned space vehicle.\nThe paper describes the technical design of the parachute and airbag subsystems,\nincluding materials, construction, and deployment techniques. Irvin in-house simulation\ntools are used to analyze parachute performance, and simulate airbag performance\nduring impact. Airbag drop testing is then performed to validate the simulations. Drop\ntests include both vertical and horizontal impact velocity components controlled using a\nrail system. Test output data includes 3-axis acceleration, airbag pressure, rotational\nrate, vent release monitoring, and high-speed video, and all data is recorded digitally at\n1000Hz bandwidth. Gardiner found that drop tests verified computer simulations, and\ncomputer simulations were then used to evaluate multiple airbag configurations.\n\nThe design and testing of the HOPE-X landing system is primarily focused on\nsimulation verification. Although this aspect of the paper is not useful in designing our\nimpact attenuation experiment, the HOPE-X landing system drop test experiment\ndesign provides a baseline with which to design a drop-test rig. Our impact attenuation\nexperiment will be constrained to studying the effect of a vertical impact, and so we are\nnot interested in rotational rates. However, a railing system to control the drop, a 1-axis\naccelerometer, and a high-speed camera will be incorporated into our experiment. Also,\nthe 1000Hz bandwidth requirement provides a useful guideline for the selection of a\ndata acquisition module.\n\nAnother paper entitled, \"Parachute Retraction Soft-Landing Systems Using\nPneumatic Muscle Actuators\" written by Brown and Haggard2 discusses the analysis\nand testing of flexible composite technology actuators. The actuators contract in the\nmoments before impact to significantly slow the descent of a payload under a parachute.\nBrown and Haggard derive a theoretical model for the tension in an ideal actuator as a\nfunction of contraction, and use static testing to determine the validity of their model.\nStatic testing also provides a measure of the efficiency for the real actuators. Dynamic\ndrop-tests are then conducted to demonstrate the payload velocity reduction due to\nretraction. The drop-test setup involves placing a load cell between the payload and\nretraction actuator, and deriving peak force, peak acceleration, and change in velocity\nfrom the force vs. time data.\n\nWhile the actual parachute retraction system is not relevant to our project, this\nwork echoes the drop-test methodology laid out in the design and testing of the HOPE-\nX landing system. Although we intend to use an accelerometer rather than a load cell to\nrecord behavior during impact, this paper verifies that initial impact velocity of the\npayload can be successfully extracted from the impact data. Additionally this paper\ndistinguishes between static and dynamic testing. Although we are not deriving a\ntheoretical model for material behavior during impact, we are assuming that every\nattenuation material possesses an ideal crush efficiency of 100%. We then determine an\nactual attenuation efficiency using static testing and verify performance through\ndynamic testing as this paper describes.\n\nChris Anderson at Draper Labs has also provided a very relevant paper entitled,\n\"Impact Shock Attenuation for Parafoil Payloads\".* Anderson's work is the only\navailable resource studying impact attenuation materials for use on small payloads\ndeployed from unmanned aerial vehicles. He derives quantitative relationships among\nimpact shock parameters showing two very important facts. Required cushion thickness\nis proportional the square of payload's initial velocity, while material properties\ndetermine the deceleration of the payload. He also defines a metric called material crush\nthickness efficiency to describe the amount of initial cushion thickness required to\n\n* Unpublished Work, given to team February 2003.\n\nachieve a certain crush displacement. These quantitative relationships are then used to\nchoose a honeycomb impact attenuator with the proper dynamic crush stress to shield a\ngiven payload from an impact shock greater than 30 Gs. Anderson then verifies results\nby measuring payload deceleration during drop testing.\n\nThis 16.62x project builds directly on Anderson's work, which provides a strong\nquantitative basis for comparing attenuation properties of expanding foam with\nhoneycomb. Anderson's theory coupled with standard drop-test methodologies provide\nthe basis for exploring a novel impact attenuation system for payloads deployed from\nUAVs.\n\n5.0 Technical Approach of Experiment\n\nA flowchart describing the experiment technical approach is presented in Figure\n1. The experiment is divided into two segments and reflects the separation between the\nprimary and secondary hypothesis. Choosing an expanding foam and honeycomb\nmaterial is the first step towards assessing both hypotheses. Material properties of the\nexpanding foam and honeycomb play a role in determining payload volume, base area,\nand mass.\n\nStatic Testing\nDrop-testing\nBeaker\nChoose Material\n3⁄4 Area (payload shape)\n3⁄4 Crush Stress\nCrush\nEfficiency\nCushion\nThickness\nSafety Margin\nTests\nVolume\nDeployment\nMechanism\nDeployment\nReliability\nCost\n\nFigure 1: Flowchart of Technical Approach\n\nOnce attenuation materials and payload properties are determined, the crush\nefficiencies for both attenuation materials are characterized through quasi-static testing\nusing a force-press. Quasi-static crush efficiency, given by Equation 1, is determined by\nloading the attenuation materials with increasing force, and monitoring material\ndisplacement. The force vs. displacement curve, it is expected to look like:\n\nCrush Displacement\n\nForce\n\nDisplacement\n\nFigure 2: Crush Displacement Curve\n\nThe crush displacement is defined as the displacement from zero force to the measured\ndisplacement where the force-displacement curve transitions from a plateau to steep\nslope. Crush displacement efficiency is then determined by taking the ratio of crush\ndisplacement to initial cushion thickness.\n\nCushion thickness to protect the payload from an impact shock no greater than\n50G is then given by Equation 2*,\n\nt\ncushion\ngGη\nν\nτ\n^\n=\n.\n\n(Eq. 2)\n\nWhere, initial velocity is 15 feet/second, g is 32 feet/second, G is the deceleration\nrequirement of 50, and\ntη is the crush efficiency for the attenuation material being\ntested.\n\nDrop tests will then be performed to verify that the crush efficiency determined\nthrough quasi-static testing matches the crush efficiency exhibited under dynamic\nconditions. Dynamic testing of the crush efficiency will ensure that the expanding foam\nand honeycomb materials do not exhibit velocity-dependant attenuation characteristics.\nFor example, a spring's resistance is not dependant on the velocity of the mass attached\n\n* Equation from unpublished work by Chris Anderson entitled, \"Impact Shock Attenuation for Parafoil\nPayloads\"\n\nto its end. However, a dashpot's resistance is dependant on the mass velocity, and so we\nwould say it exhibits velocity-dependant attenuation characteristics.\n\nDynamic crush efficiency will be determined by dropping the payload-\nattenuation material system from a certain height using less cushioning material than is\ncalculated to be necessary to achieve a deceleration during impact of 50G. This ensures\nthat the attenuation material will have completely crushed during impact. Maximum\ncrush displacement will be measured using a high-speed camera.\n\nOnce crush efficiency is verified, drop-tests will be conducted using the cushion\nthickness found from Equation 2. This is the marginal cushion thickness necessary to\nprotect a payload from an impact shock greater than 50Gs. However, drop-tests will\nprobably reveal a distribution of shocks felt by the payload centered on 50Gs. From this\ndistribution, a new cushion thickness will be chosen that will protect the payload within\ntwo standard deviations from 50Gs. This new cushion thickness will contribute to the\nfinal volume occupied by each attenuation material.\n\nThe assessment of the secondary hypothesis is contingent on designing a\ndeployment mechanism for the expanding foam impact attenuator. The volume\noccupied by the deployment mechanism components will be incorporated into the total\nvolume occupied by an EFIA system. Deployment reliability will be determined by\ntriggering the deployment mechanism a statistically significant number of times, and\nfinding the percent of successful deployments to total deployments. Successful\ndeployments of an EFIA are counted as the number of deployments in which the\nexpanding foam expands to within 5% of its expected thickness within two minutes.\nThis value will be compared to a honeycomb deployment reliability of 100%, since\nhoneycomb does not require a deployment mechanism.\n\nCost for each impact attenuation device will be defined as the sum of the off-\nthe-shelf pricing for each of the components necessary to protect the given payload\nfrom a shock greater than 50Gs.\n\nIf a deployment mechanism is not designed, the secondary hypothesis cannot be\ntested. However, a set of requirements outlining the design of a deployment mechanism\n\nto meet the secondary hypothesis can be formed based on the results of testing the\nprimary hypothesis.\n\n6.0 Description of Apparatus\n\nThe apparatus for conducting this experiment include a drop-test rig, force press,\nbeaker, accelerometer, and a digital timer with photogates.\n\nThe drop-test rig will primarily be constructed out of Unistrut metal secured to\nthe Strongwall in the hanger of Building 33. The drop-test rig will consist of two\nrailings held vertical with Unistrut frames. A Unistrut cantilever will extend out from\nthe Strongwall above the railings and hold a pulley. The payload will attach to the two\nrailings through linear bearings. Rope wire will be attached near the top of each face of\nthe payload box and will run through a pulley to a winch located a few feet away from\nthe drop-test rig.\n\nIf friction is neglected, a payload must be dropped from a height of\napproximately 3 feet in order to reach an impact velocity of 15 feet per second. The\nheight of the proposed drop-test rig is 6 feet to account for friction due to the drop-test\nrails.\n\nAn Instron force press available in the advanced composites lab TELAC will be\nused to measure quasi-static crush efficiency. A beaker will be used to carry out water\ndisplacement volume measurements, an accelerometer will be attached to the payload to\nmeasure acceleration during impact, and a digital timer with photogates will be attached\nto the drop-test rig to verify impact velocity.\n\n7.0 Description of Test Articles\n\nThe test articles for this experiment include the payload, expanding foam\nmaterial, honeycomb material, and the expanding foam impact attenuation deployment\nmechanism.\n\n7.1 Payload\n\nThe payload will be cubic in shape and occupy about a cubic foot. A conceptual\nsketch of the payload/attenuation material system is shown in Figure 3.\n\nDuct Tape\n\nPayload\n\nFigure 3: Payload/ Attenuation Material System\n\nAttenuation\nMaterial\n\nThe payload base area must be sized so that the readily available expanding foam\nproducts of similar dimensions can be easily interfaced with the payload base. Since\nhoneycomb material can be sized to any dimension and is not a limiting factor, the\npayload base will 15 inches by 18 inches, the same dimensions as smallest expanding\nfoam bag. However, the expanding foam and honeycomb materials possess different\ncritical crush stresses. In order for the payload to achieve the desired deceleration, the\nmass of the payload is a function of base area, deceleration limit, and critical crush\nstress as shown in Equation 3,\n\nmG\nA\ncrush =\nσ\n.\n\n(Eq. 3)\n\nBecause the critical crush stress is a material property and will vary depending on\nwhether we are testing honeycomb or expanding foam, and both the base area and\ndeceleration limit are fixed, the mass of the payload must vary slightly depending on\nwhich attenuation material is being tested. The critical crush stresses of the impact\nattenuation materials being tested range from 9-11 pounds per square inch, yielding a\npayload mass of approximately 45 pounds.\n\nDuct tape will serves as the means of attaching attenuator materials to the base\nof the payload box since it will not contribute to experiment uncertainty by creating\nanother impact interface.\n\n7.2 Expanding Foam Material\n\nThe expanding foam product under primary consideration for evaluation is the\nInstapak Quick Foam Packaging manufactured by Sealed Air Corporation3 shown in\nFigure 4. This particular packaging is desirable because it is self-contained. Two small\nchemical compartments are located inside a sealed plastic bag, and the plastic bag is\nslowly heated to the optimal temperature for foam expansion using a heating device\nsupplied by the company. Then a person or mechanism applies pressure to the two\nchemical compartments, breaking a barrier, and causing the chemicals to mix. The\nchemical reaction results in expanding foam filling the plastic bag. The time to\nexpansion is approximately 20 seconds, which is an advantage over other expanding\nfoam products that take as long as an hour to fully expand.\n\n7.3 Honeycomb Material\n\nThe honeycomb attenuation material tested by Chris Anderson* was Hexacomb\nproduct HEX700 manufactured by Pactiv4 shown in Figure 5, and will be used again in\nthis experiment.\n\n8.0 Description of Measurements\n\n8.1 Crush Efficiency\n\nQuasi-static and dynamic crush efficiencies are measured using the same\nparameter of attenuation material cushion thickness, the same dependent variable of\nmaterial crush displacement, and the same independent variables material and trial\nnumber. Test matrices for measuring static and dynamic crush efficiencies are shown in\nTables 1 and 2 respectively.\n\n* Unpublished work by Chris Anderson entitled, \"Impact Shock Attenuation for Parafoil Payloads\"\n\nTable 1: Test Matrix for Quasi-Static Crush Efficiency\n\nMaterial :\nHoneycomb\n\nMaterial:\nExpanding Foam\nTrial #\nCrush Displacement\nTrials 1-5\nTrial #\nCrush Displacement\nTrials 1-5\n\n...\n\n...\n\nTable 2: Test Matrix for Dynamic Crush Efficiency\n\nMaterial :\nHoneycomb\n\nMaterial:\nExpanding Foam\nTrial #\nCrush Displacement\nTrials 1-5\nTrial #\nCrush Displacement\nTrials 1-5\n\n...\n\n...\n\n8.2 Safety Margin\n\nWhile conducting drop-tests to determine an appropriate safety margin for\ncushion thickness, the parameters include a fixed height to achieve the desired impact\nvelocity, and the marginal cushion thickness calculated in Equation 2. The independent\n\nvariables are material and trial number, and the dependent variable to be measured is\nmaximum acceleration during impact. The test matrix for safety margin calculations is\nshown in Table 3.\n\nTable 3: Test Matrix for Safety Margin Calculations\nMaterial: Honeycomb\nMaterial: Expanding Foam\nTrial #\nMax.

The independent variable is material, and\nthe dependent variable is the volume of water displaced by the attenuation material. The\ntest matrix for volume measurements is shown in Table 4.\n\nTable 4: Test Matrix for Volume Measurements\nMaterial\nVolume\nHoneycomb\n\nExpanding Foam\n\n8.4 Deployment Reliability\n\nDeployment reliability will only be quantified for the expanding foam impact\nattenuator. The independent variable is the trial number, and the dependent variable is a\nBoolean true or false statement for the successful deployment of a cushion thickness\nwithin 5% of the expected value in under two minutes.

The\ndependent variable is the off-the-shelf cost of the attenuation mechanism. The test\nmatrix for cost is shown in Table 6.\n\nTable 6: Test Matrix for Cost\nMaterial\nCost\nHoneycomb\n\nExpanding Foam\n\n9.0 Discussion of Errors\n\nThe errors of concern in this experiment include instrument errors for measuring\nacceleration, volume displacement, crush displacement, cushion thickness, and impact\nvelocity. Errors in these measurements lead to indirect errors in crush efficiency. Also,\nthe questions regarding appropriate sampling rates result in additional error\nconsiderations for acceleration, crush displacement, and impact velocity.\n\nAcceleration will be measured using a 100G tri-axial vibration accelerometer\nfrom Crossbow, and provides sensitivity to within 2%. This error is acceptable. The\nstandard data-sampling rate during impact attenuation drop-tests is approximately\n\n1000Hz1,5, and is considered negligible in our experiment since data acquisition will be\nconducted using a PC with a sampling rate of 33 kHz per accelerometer input.\n\nA beaker for measuring volume displacement with a capacity of 3000 milliliters\nand graduation of 50 milliliters would yield approximately a 5% error in measuring the\nvolume of an unexpanded foam bag. This is reasonable since we are interested in\nquantifying a change in volume of approximately 75%.\n\nThe scale used in the high-speed camera photographs limit the error in crush\ndisplacement. Assuming we are using a standard ruler as scale, error is on the order of\nmillimeters, which is acceptable. Additional error due to sampling error is considered\nnegligible since the camera records 8000 frames per second, which is approximately\neight times higher than the standard sampling rate for drop-tests.\n\nCushion thickness will likely be measured with a standard ruler or caliber,\nwhich has a maximum error on the order of millimeters.\n\nError in crush displacement is a function of the non-correlated, independent\nerrors in crush displacement and cushion thickness and is expected to be well within\nacceptable limits. Error in impact velocity is due to error in the digital time and\nphotogate used to measure the impact velocity as well as error in maintaining a constant\ndrop height for all trials. These errors are also expected to be within acceptable limits.\nA more detailed analysis of impact velocity and other errors are found in Section 11.1.\n\n10.0 Experiment Design\n\n10.1 Design and Construction of Drop-Test Rig\nDetailed drawings for the drop-test rig are included in Appendix A, and a\ndetailed parts list of construction materials and instrumentation are listed in Appendix\nB. A three-view dimensioned sketch of the test-rig is included on the next page in\nFigure 7 to supplement the discussion on design and construction of the drop-test rig.\nThe drop-test rig consists of two frames spaced six feet apart to hold the two six\nfoot long railings. The frames will each be constructed from two long Unistrut lengths,\n\nand two short Unistrut lengths cut to size in the Aero/Astro Department Machine Shop.\nThe two long beams are 24.6 inches in length, and the two short beams are 17 inches in\nlength. The railings are attached to the inside of the frames at the midpoint of the short\nlengths using shaft supports, and the payload is attached to the railing through a sliding\nlinear bearing. An isometric view of this system is shown in Figure 6.\n\nFigure 6: Isometric View of Unistrut, Railing, and Shaft Support\n\n10.1\"\n20.3\"\n10.1\"\n3.0\"\nDrop-Test Rig : Front View\n6.0\"\n2.0\"\n2.0\"\nx.x\"\n2.7\"\n20.3\"\n15.0\"\n72.0\"\nKey:\n1 - Unistrut\n2- Pulley\n3- High Speed Camera\n4- I-Beam to Connect\nUnistrut to Strongwall\n5- Wood Impact\nPlatform\n6- Metal L-Support with\nPhotogate\n7 - Drop Railings\n8- Strongwall\n9- Linear Bearings\n\nSide View\n\n12.0\"\n\n10.1\"\n0.8\"\n3.3\"\n9.0\"\n18.0\"\n12.3\"\n24.6\"\nTop View\n\nFigure 7: Three-View Drawing of Drop-Test Rig\n\nTwo holes with 0.11 inch diameter must be drilled 1.5 inches apart and centered\non each short Unistrut length to bolt the shaft support to the frame. The each Unistrut\nframe will be assembled using two right-angled Unistrut brackets attached to the outside\nof the frame. A 13.1 inch cantilever Unistrut is used to mount the pulley, will be placed\n12 inches above the top frame, resulting in a drop-test rig height of about 7 feet. The\nframe and cantilever Unistruts are attached to the Strongwall in the hangar of Building\n33 by an I-beam connectors specifically designed to interface with the Strongwall.\nA two inch tall wooden platform with a base area of 15 inches by 18 inches is\nplaced inside the bottom frame and rests on the floor. This serves as a hard surface for\nthe payload to impact. A 6 inch tall metal L-shape holding a photogate to measure\nimpact velocity will be clamped to the bottom frame 2.7 inch from the frame edge as\nshown in the dimensional sketch. The distance from the bottom of the photogate to the\nfloor is variable and must be calculated for the cushion thickness used during the drop-\ntest. This distance if found by adding the platform height, blinder width, and cushion\nthickness. The high speed camera will be placed 2 inch above the floor and face a side\nof the frame where the L-shape does not interfere with a picture of the attenuation\nmaterial during impact, as shown in the dimensional sketch. A ruler will be placed next\nto the platform, facing the high-speed camera to measure attenuator crush displacement\nduring impact.\n\n10.2 Design and Construction of Payload Box\nDetailed drawings for the payload box are included in Appendix A, and a\ndetailed parts list of construction materials and instrumentation are listed in Appendix\nB. Figure 8 shows an isometric view of the payload design to supplement the discussion\non the design and construction of the payload box.\n\nFigure 8: Isometric View of Payload Box\n\nThe payload box is constructed of 0.7 inch thick plywood cut to the dimensions\nspecified in Appendix A and screwed together to form a box with a base of 15 inches by\n18 inches. Box structural reinforcements are sawed to the appropriate dimensions\nspecified in Appendix A and screwed in along each inner edge as shown.\nThe box must be modified in order to interface with the drop-test rig and to\naccommodate appropriate instrumentation. Four holes must be drilled on two faces to\nattach the box to the railing ball bearings. Two holes must be drilled to attach the\naccelerometer to a face not fastened to ball bearings. The accelerometer should be\nscrewed onto the box with connecting wires pointing up such that the wires will not\ninterfere with the frame during drop testing. Five holes must be drilled into the payload\nbox base to insert bolts that will secure the weights inside the box. Finally, a hole near\nthe top of each payload box face will provide a place to tie the rope wire. This rope wire\nwill run through the pulley in the drop-test rig to a winch and quick release mechanism\nused to raise and drop the weighted payload box. The diameters and locations of all\nholes are specified in Appendix A.\nThe blinder that interrupts the photogate to measure impact velocity must be\nmilled in the Aero/Astro Machine Shop to be 4 inches long, 0.120 inches +/- 0.005\n\nwide, and 0.1 inch thick. This blinder will be attached to the bottom of the front payload\nface as shown in Appendix A.\n\n10.3 Measurement Systems\nFour measurement systems are necessary to evaluate the primary hypothesis: an\nInstron force press, high speed camera, accelerometer, and digital timer with\nphotogates.\n\nInstron Force Press\nThe Instron force press, located in the advanced composites lab TELAC, is a\nself-contained system and does not require any additional hardware interfaces in order\nto measure a material's crush displacement under varying force. The force-displacement\ndata is recorded on a computer using Instron software and can be imported into an\nExcel file to plot the force-displacement curve.\n\nHigh Speed Camera System\nThe high speed camera is connected by a cable to a designated computer that\nrecords the image data. The data can then be analyzed using the high speed camera\nsoftware package. Specifically, the software is capable of measuring distance in the\npicture frames using a cursor controlled by the user.\n\nAccelerometer System\nThe accelerometer must be interfaced with a computer through the use of an\nanalog-to-digital-board (A/D board). The accelerometer has five output pins for: a 5-\nvolt supply, ground, x-axis acceleration, y-axis acceleration, and z-axis acceleration.\nThe 5-volt supply pin is connect to a battery, the ground is connected to a ground on the\nA/D board, and the acceleration measurements are connected to A/D board inputs. The\nA/D board cable interfaces with a computer, and acceleration measurements are\nacquired using Labview software. There is a possibility that the accelerometer cannot\n\ninterface with the same computer used for the high speed camera, and a separate\ncomputer for collecting accelerometer measurements will be available.\n\nDigital Timer with Photogates\nThe digital timer with photogates is a stand-alone system and does not need to\nbe hooked up to a computer for data acquisition. The instrument consists of a digital\ntimer and two photogates. The digital timer can be set to display the instantaneous\nvelocity of an object through each of the two photogates. The user records the\ninstrument measurements manually between trials.\n\n10.4 Buy/Make Decisions\nThe vast majority of equipment, instruments, and materials necessary for this\nproject are being borrowed from the Aero/Astro Department. However, certain\nmaterials must still be constructed or bought. The Detailed Parts List in Appendix B\nspecifies how each part will be acquired and the Specification Sheet in Appendix C lists\nthe part numbers and order codes for materials to be purchased.\n\nItems To Be Bought\nWhile the Aero/Astro Department already has two 4 foot long railings for\nconducting drop testing, these are not tall enough to ensure the specified impact velocity\nof 15 feet per second. Thus, two 6 foot long railings will be purchased and delivered\nover the summer for use in the fall term.\nOne Instapak Heater and two cartons of 48 Instapak Quickpak Expanding Foam\nBags (15 inches by 18 inches in area) must be purchased. However, the honeycomb\nimpact attenuation material does not need to be purchased. The project advisor\nChristian Anderson is able to supply four 48 inch by 96 inch sheets of 1 inch thick\nhoneycomb. An addition four 48 inch by 96 inch sheets of 0.5 inch honeycomb can be\nordered as samples from the manufacturer Pactiv at no cost.\n\nA 3000-milliliter measuring cup with 50-milliliter graduations must be ordered\nto perform displacement volume measurements of appropriate accuracy on the\nunexpanded Instapak Expanding Foam Bags. Also one inch by inch by bass wood\nlengths must be bought to reinforce the payload box design.\n\nItems To Be Made\nThe payload box must have a base area of 15 inches by 18 inches based on the\nexpanding foam bag area. Rather than modify an existing box with a smaller base by\nadding a adapter base or work with an existing box of larger base where the entire base\nwould not be cushioned with attenuator material, the decision was made to build a box\nto the appropriate dimensions out of plywood. An impact platform for the drop-test rig\nmust also be cut with an area of 15 inches by 18 inches. The blinder to interrupt the\nphotogate cannot be bought and must be manufactured in the Aero/Astro Machine\nShop. Also, the metal-L to hold the photogate at the appropriate height on the drop-test\nrig must be made.\n\n10.5 Safety Concerns\nThe primary safety concern associated with the experiment is the danger of the\nfalling payload box injuring a person. However, using a winch and quick-release\nmechanism reduces this danger. A winch stationed a few feet away from the drop-test\nrig ensures that the person conducting the drop test is safely away from the rig while the\nweighted payload is raised. Also, the quick-release mechanism allows the person to\nrelease the payload from a safe distance.\nOperational safety measures will ensure that observers will not be injured. The\nperson operating the winch will ask observers to step away from the drop-test rig when\nthe payload is being raised and check that there is no one near the drop-test rig before\nreleasing the payload.\n\n11.0 Data Analysis\n\n11.1 Data Reduction Techniques\n\n11.1.1 Quasi-Static Crush Efficiency\nThe Instron Force Press produces a force-displacement graph conceptually\nsimilar to Figure 2 shown again here for reference. Five trials will be conducted for\neach impact attenuation material being tested resulting in five force-displacement\ncurves for each material. The initial cushion thickness and crush displacement for each\ngraph is measured, and five quasi-static crush efficiencies are calculated and averaged\nto produce the final quasi-static crush efficiency for a given material.\n\nCrush Displacement\n\nForce\n\nDisplacement\n\nFigure 2: Crush Displacement Curve\n\nThe force-displacement graph will not have a sharp corner at the transition from\nplateau to steep slope clearly marking the maximum crush displacement. Averaging the\ncalculations from five different graphs per material reduces the effect of errors in\nchoosing an approximate maximum crush displacement.\n\n11.1.2 Dynamic Crush Efficiency\nDynamic crush efficiency is calculated using a high-speed camera to measure\ncrush displacement. Conceptual examples of snapshots from the high-speed camera are\nshown in Figure 9.\n\nImpact Bottom Out\nPayload\nBox\nAttenuator\nPlatform\nCrush\nDisplacement\nBeginning of Impact\n\nFigure 9: Crush Displacement Measured from the High Speed Camera\n\nFive drop-tests using the high-speed camera are performed for each attenuator\nmaterial. The initial cushion thickness and bottom out thickness are measured for each\ntrial using the high-speed camera software and subtracted to find the crush\ndisplacement. Dynamic crush efficiencies are then calculated for all trials and averaged\nto yield an average dynamic crush efficiency for a given material.\nThe quasi-static and dynamic crush efficiencies should not be dramatically\ndifferent. If there is a significant difference than this may indicate velocity-dependent\nattenuation characteristics. Whether the differences between the quasi-static and\ndynamic crush efficiencies are slight or large, the dynamic crush efficiency will be used\nto calculate theoretical cushion thickness since it will more accurately reflect the\nperformance characteristics of the impact attenuator under the specified requirements.\n\n11.1.3 Safety Margin Tests\nOnce a theoretical cushion thickness is chosen, the payload is drop-tested with\nattenuator material of the theoretical cushion thickness. Acceleration during the impact\nis recorded using Labview and the peak acceleration is extracted from each graph.\nThese peak accelerations form a distribution of maximum acceleration felt by the\npayload during impact.\n\nThe number of drop-tests necessary to guarantee that the peak acceleration\ndistribution is representative of the distribution of the attenuator population must be\ncalculated using a Student-T test. This is because the standard deviation of the\npopulation is unknown. A statistical analysis shows that 24 drop-tests are necessary for\nthe attenuator material to be 95% confident that 95% of the actual peak acceleration\nmeasurements are within two sample standard deviations above the sample mean.\nThe peak acceleration distribution mean and the acceleration two standard\ndeviations above the mean can be calculated using a Matlab command. The difference\nbetween the two standard deviation acceleration and the mean acceleration is the impact\ndeceleration limit safety margin. The final cushion thickness is calculated using\n\n,\nG\nG\nG\nt\nrequiremen\nsafety\n∆\n-\n=\n\n(Eq. 4)\n\nwhere\nis the impact deceleration limit and\nt\nrequiremen\nG\nG\n∆\nis the impact deceleration\nlimit safety margin.\n\n11.1.4 Pre-deployment Volume\nThe honeycomb attenuator material volume is calculated by multiplying the\nfinal cushion thickness by the base area of the payload box. The expanding foam\nattenuator volume is found by submerging the number of unexpanded foam bags\nnecessary to achieve the final cushion thickness in a graduated beaker to measure water\ndisplacement. In the case that the number of unexpanded bags necessary to achieve the\nfinal cushion thickness is not an integer, the number of bags necessary will be rounded\nup to achieve a conservative estimate of expanding foam pre-deployment volume.\n\n11.2 Error Analysis\nThe purpose of this analysis is to quantify the error in the measurements of crush\ndisplacement efficiency and pre-deployment attenuator volume used to assess our\nprimary hypothesis.\n\n11.2.1 Crush Displacement\nCrush displacement efficiency is calculated by dividing material crush\ndisplacement by initial cushion thickness. Quasi-static measurements of crush\ndisplacement are conducted with an Instron force press machine available in the\nadvanced composites lab TELAC, and dynamic measurements of crush displacement\nare conducted with a high-speed camera and drop test rig.\n\nQuasi-Static Crush Efficiency Error\nCrush displacement measurements using an Instron force press are accurate to\nwithin 0.01 inches, and cushion thickness is measured using a standard ruler with\naccuracy conservatively estimated to within one-sixteenth of an inch.\nGiven the equation for crush efficiency (Eq.1) and the general rule for\ncombination of errors:\n...\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\ndx\nx\nF\ndx\nx\nF\ndx\nx\nF\ndz\nδ\nδ\nδ\nδ\nδ\nδ\n+\n+\n=\n, (Eq. 5)\nwhere\nthe error in crush efficiency is given by:\n...)\n,\n,\n(\nx\nx\nx\nF\nz =\n\n)\n(\n)\n(\n*\nτ\nτ\nη\nη\nd\nx\nx\nd\nd\n+\n=\n. (Eq. 6)\nUsing the impact velocity specification of 15 ft/s and an impact deceleration limit of\n50G, Equation (2) yields an expected crush displacement (x) of 1.29 inches. The\nexpected cushion thickness (τ ), based on Anderson's paper*, is 2 inches. This yields an\nexpected crush efficiency of 0.65. Substituting these values and the expected errors into\nthe equation results in an error for quasi-static crush efficiency of 2.1%.\n\n* Unpublished Work, given to team February 2003.\n\nDynamic Crush Efficiency Error\nThe crush displacement measured using a high-speed camera incurs two sources\nof errors. The high-speed camera software possesses the capability of measuring\ndistances between objects in a frame given an initial reference distance; one error is due\nto the accuracy of the ruler in the picture frames used to calibrate the camera software.\nThe second source of error is due to the camera's frame rate of 8000 frames per second\nsince the impact attenuation material may continue to crush during the interval between\nframes.\nAssuming a standard ruler to calibrate distance measurements in the picture\nframes, the accuracy in crush displacement (dx\n) is approximately one-sixteenth of\nan inch (0.0625 inch or 0.005 feet).\ncrush\nIn order to quantify the error due to the camera's frame rate, consider a worst-\ncase situation where the payload decelerates at 50G down to zero velocity and then\nrebounds with the same acceleration of 50G. The maximum amount of time the\nattenuation material may continue to crush between camera frames is one half the time\nbetween picture frames. The time between pictures frames is given by the reciprocal of\n8000 frames per second and yields a maximum of\nseconds between\nframes. The maximum error due to this frame rate is given by\n*\n.1\n-\n=\ncamera\nt\nat\nd\ncrush\nx\n=\n, (Eq.7)\nwhere\ncamera\nt\nt\n=\nand a = 50G = 1610 ft/sec^2, and yields an error in crush\ndisplacement of 3.78 x 10 ^-5 inches, or 3.14 x 10 ^-6 ft. The total error in crush\ndisplacement due to these two errors is given by:\n)\n(\n)\n(\ncrush\ncrush\nx\ndx\ndx\nd\ntotal\n+\n=\n, (Eq.8)\nand yields an error of 0.063 inches or 0.0052 inches.\n\nThe error in crush efficiency is given by:\n\n)\n(\n)\n(\n*\nτ\nτ\nη\nη\nd\nx\nd\nd\ntotal\nxtotal\n+\n=\n. (Eq.9)\n\nAs with the quasi-static crush efficiency error calculation, we use the specified\nrequirements for initial velocity and an impact deceleration limit. This yields a crush\ndisplacement of 1.29 inches. Assuming a cushion thickness of 2 inches yields an\napproximate crush efficiency of 0.65. This results in a dynamic crush efficiency error of\n3.75%, which is acceptable to measure our hypothesis.\nExperimental results for quasi-static and dynamic crush efficiency are expected\nto be very similar. However, in the case of a disparity, dynamic crush efficiency will be\nthe quantity used to calculate other metrics since it will more closely describe the\nmaterial performance in the real-world application of parafoil/payload system impact\nattenuation. As a result, the error in dynamic crush efficiency will be propagated to\ncalculate the error in other metrics rather than the error in quasi-static crush efficiency.\nThe experiment primary hypothesis states that expanding foam has a crush\nefficiency of no more than 30% less than honeycomb's crush efficiency. In order to\ndefinitively evaluate this metric to an accuracy such that the hypothesis can be assessed,\nwe must show one of two results:\n1) To prove the hypothesis true, we must show that the crush efficiency of\nexpanding foam is no more than 26.25% less than the crush efficiency of paper\nhoneycomb.\n2) To disprove the hypothesis, we must show that the crush efficiency of\nexpanding foam is more than 33.75% less than the crush efficiency of paper\nhoneycomb.\n\n11.2.2 Pre-deployment Attenuator Volume\nPre-deployment attenuator volume is calculated through a series of steps. First,\ninitial cushion thickness is calculated using experiment specifications for velocity and\nimpact deceleration limit, and the calculated dynamic crush efficiency. Then the\npayload is drop-tested using the initial cushion thickness to form a distribution of peak\naccelerations felt by the payload. This distribution will be widened due to random\naccelerometer error and random error in achieving a constant drop height for all trials.\nThe distribution is shifted due to bias errors in impact velocity measurement, crush\nefficiency, and initial cushion thickness. A final cushion thickness is calculated from\nthe peak acceleration distribution to ensure the payload can withstand up to two\nstandard deviations from the mean impact shock. This final thickness then results in a\npre-deployment volume.\n\nInitial Cushion Thickness Error\nThe initial cushion thickness is given by the equation:\nη\nτ\ngG\nv\ninitial\n=\n, (Eq.10)\n\nwhere the impact velocity specification (v) is 15 feet per second, the impact\ndeceleration limit (G) is 50. The crush efficiency (η ) has an accuracy of +/- 3.75%.\nSince crush efficiency is the only error, the general rule for combination of errors\nyields:\n)\n(\nη\nη\nτ\nd\ngG\nv\nd\ninitial =\n, (Eq.11)\n\nwhere η is given the approximate value 0.65 as with the crush efficiency error analysis.\nThis yields an initial cushion thickness error of 0.234 inches, or 0.020 feet.\n\nError Effects on the Distribution of Peak Accelerations\n\nRandom Error\nThere are two sources of random error affecting the distribution of peak\naccelerations. One source is due to the accelerometer instrumentation error. The other\nerror occurs because it is not possible to achieve the exact same drop-height for all\ntrials.\nPeak acceleration is measured using a Crossbow Accelerometer series\nCXL100HF3. According to the product specification sheet, the input range is +/- 100g\nand the sensitivity is +/- 10 millivolts/g. According the specification footnote, this\ncorresponds to a +/- 2% error in the accelerometer measurement. Operating near and\naround the impact deceleration limit of 50G, this causes a 1g random measurement\nerror.\n\nThe error due to uncertainty in the fixed drop-height results in random error in\nimpact velocity. This in turn results in a variation of the payload's acceleration during\nimpact that is not due to material properties of the attenuation material. Assuming the\npayload drop-height can be fixed to within one-eight of an inch (by either lining up a\nmark on the wire to a mark on the winch, or else by lining up a mark on the payload to a\nmark on the drop-test rig), the error in impact velocity is given by:\n\n)\n(\ndh\ng\ndv =\n, (Eq. 12)\nwhere dh is the error in drop-height = 1/8 inch or 0.0104 feet. This results in an impact\nvelocity error of 0.819 feet per second.\nImpact velocity is related to the acceleration felt by the payload during impact\nby:\ninitial\nv\nA\nητ\n=\n. (Eq.13)\n\nThe velocity impact requirement is 15 feet per second with a random error of 0.819 feet\nper second as calculated above. The error in crush efficiency (η ) and initial cushion\nthickness (\ninitial\nτ\n) are bias errors and are dealt with separately later. Therefore the\nrandom error in acceleration felt by the payload is due to an error in drop-height. This\nerror is given by:\n\n2)\n(\ndv\nv\ndA\ninitial\nητ\n=\n, (Eq. 14)\nwhere v is the impact velocity requirement of 15 feet per second, η is estimated to be\n0.65, and\ninitial\nτ\nis estimated to be 1.29 inches or 0.11 feet. This results in a variation of\n5.34 g in the payload's acceleration during impact not due to material properties of the\nattenuation material.\nCombining the errors due to the accelerometer measurement and variation in\ndrop-height using the general rule for combination of errors yields an equation for the\ntotal random error in acceleration not due to material properties:\n\nheight\ndrop\nter\naccelerome\nrandom\nd\nd\ndG\n-\n+\n=\n. (Eq.15)\n\nThis yields a total random error not due to variation in material property of\n5.43g. This random error means that if all the peak acceleration measurements fall\nwithin +/- 5.43g of the distribution mean, the spread cannot only be attributed to\nmaterial property variation. However, measurements greater than +/- 5.43g from the\ndistribution mean are not only a result of instrument error and can be attributed to\nmaterial property variations.\n\nBias Error due to Initial Cushion Thickness, Crush Efficiency, and Impact\nVelocity Measurements\nThe impact acceleration felt by a payload impacting the ground at a given\nvelocity, with an impact attenuation of a certain cushion thickness and crush efficiency\nis given by\n\ninitial\nv\nA\nητ\n=\n. (Eq. 16)\nWhile the error in the accelerometer measurement yields a lower limit in the spread that\ncan be attributed to material property variations, the errors in initial crush thickness,\ncrush efficiency, and impact velocity measurements will also impact how the peak\nacceleration distribution is interpreted.\nOnce an initial cushion thickness is calculated its error will remain fixed with\nrespect to a theoretical cushion thickness calculated in a world without measurement\nerrors. Therefore, this error is a bias error and will shift a peak acceleration distribution\nmean to the left or right some fixed amount. Likewise, once crush efficiency is\ncalculated it will possess a constant error resulting in a distribution bias. Error in the\nmeasurement of impact velocity can also be considered a bias error if the payload is\nconsistently dropped from a precisely marked height as described above. This is\nbecause the measurement in impact velocity is used to precisely mark the drop-height\nand once the height is set, the velocity measurement error remains constant with respect\nto the true height necessary to achieve the appropriate impact velocity. The total\nexpected bias error can be quantified using the general rule for combination of errors.\nWhile errors in initial cushion thickness and crush efficiency have been calculated, error\nin impact velocity measurements with a digital time and photogate remains to be\nquantified.\n\nVelocity Error\nThe digital timer and photogate measurement system has two sources of\nerror. One error comes from the photogate sampling rate, and the other error\noccurs because the blind is accelerating through the photogate.\nThe photogate uses a quartz oscillator of 6 MHz frequency to create a\nbeam of light, and samples the light at 1 MHz +/- 50 Hz to detect a break in the\nlight. As a result the sampling rate is the limiting factor, not the quartz oscillator.\nThe digital timer's accuracy in time is the reciprocal of the sampling time. The\nuncertainty +/- 50 Hz is negligible, and the resulting uncertainty in time is\napproximately 1.0 x 10^-6 seconds.\nInstantaneous velocity is measured using one photogate, a barrier of a\ncertain width, and a measurement of the time that the barrier blocks the light.\nVelocity is found from the following equation:\nsample\nbarrier\nimpact\nt\nw\nV\n=\n, (Eq. 17)\nwhere\nbarrier width and t\n= the reciprocal of the number of\nsamples that are dark.\n=\nbarrier\nw\nsample\n\nUsing the general rule for combination of errors, the error in velocity is given\nby:\n\n)\n(\n)\n(\nsample\nsample\nbarrier\nbarrier\nt\ndt\nw\ndw\nv\ndv\n+\n=\n. (Eq.18)\n\nAccording the the digital timer and photogate manual, the smallest\nallowable barrier is 3 millimeters in width or 0.12 inches, and this can be\nmachined on a mill to within 0.005 inches. A barrier of this width results in a\nof 6.67 x 10^-4 seconds. Substituting these values and the impact velocity\nsample\nt\n\nrequirement of 15 feet per second into the equation for velocity error results in\nan impact velocity error of 0.625 feet/second.\nHowever, the blind is accelerating through the photogate and this leads\nto a second error in velocity measurement. The photogate is actually measuring\nthe average velocity of the blind through the gate, and so the error due to\nacceleration is given by one half the change in velocity through the gate.\nThe change in velocity is given by\nbarrier\ngw\nv\n=\n∆\n, (Eq.19)\nand the error in velocity is given by:\nv\ndv\n∆\n= 2\n. (Eq.20)\n\nThis results in a velocity error due to acceleration of 0.40 feet per second.\nThe total error in velocity is then given by\ndv\ndv\ndvtotal\n+\n=\n, (Eq.21)\nwhich yields a total velocity error of 0.743 feet per second.\n\nTotal Bias Error\nThe bias errors due to initial cushion thickness, crush efficiency, and impact\nvelocity measurements shift the peak acceleration distribution. Each error's contribution\nto the shift is assumed to be random and independent of the other errors. Therefore\nthese errors can be combined using the general rule for combination of errors:\n\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\nτ\nητ\nη\nτ\nη\nητ\nd\ng\nv\nd\ng\nv\ndv\ng\nv\nGshift\n+\n+\n=\n. (Eq. 22)\n\nThis results in a total bias error of 10.93 Gs, which means our peak acceleration\ndistribution could be shifted up to +/- 10.93 Gs due to measurement errors.\n\nFinal Cushion Thickness Error\nFinal cushion thickness is calculated using the equation:\nη\nτ\n)\n(\nG\nG\ng\nv\nfinal\n∆\n-\n=\n, (Eq.23)\nwhere (v) is the impact velocity requirement of 15 feet/second, and (G) is the impact\ndeceleration limit of 50. Crush efficiency (η ) has an error of +/- 3.75%, and (\n) is\ndefined as the two standard deviation G variation on the peak acceleration distribution\nplus a random error of +/- 5.43g not due to variation in attenuator material properties.\nG\n∆\nUsing the general rule for combination of errors, the error in the final cushion\nthickness as a function of the error in crush efficiency and the error in\nis given by\nG\n∆\n\n))\n(\n(\n)\n)\n(\n(\nη\nη\nη\nτ\nd\nG\nG\ng\nv\nG\nd\nG\nG\ng\nv\nd\nfinal\n-\n∆\n+\n∆\n-\n∆\n=\n, (Eq .24)\n\nwhere we estimate an approximate value for G\n∆\nto be 15. This yields an error in final\ncushion thickness of 0.025 ft or 0.30 inches.\n\nNotice the bias errors do not affect the error in the final cushion thickness. This\nis because the bias errors only serve to shift the mean of the distribution, and do not\naffect its spread. Thus they do not affect the relative distance of two standard deviations\nfrom the distribution mean.\n\nPre-deployment Volume Error\nThe pre-deployment volumes are calculated differently for honeycomb and\nexpanding foam. Since honeycomb maintains the same volume in the pre-deployment\nstage and post-deployment stage, pre-deployment volume is calculated by multiplying\nthe payload base area by the final cushion thickness. An expanding foam impact\nattenuation material is different in nature. The foam expands to the final cushion\nthickness after deployment. Therefore, the final cushion thickness dictates how many\nInstapak Quickpak expanding foam bags are necessary to achieve desired impact\n\nattenuation. These bags are then submerged in a beaker and the water displacement\nvolume yields expanding foam pre-deployment volume.\nThe predeployment volume for the honeycomb impact attenuation material is\ngiven by:\nfinal\nbase\nhoneycomb\nA\nV\nτ\n*\n=\n, (Eq.25)\n\nwhere the error in the pre-deployment volume of honeycomb is a function of the error\nin final cushion thickness and base area measurements. Assuming each side of the 15\" x\n18\" payload base is constructed to within 1/16\", the error in the base area measure is\n0.010 square feet or 0.122 square inches.\nThe error in the predeployment volume of honeycomb is given by:\nbase\nfinal\nfinal\nbase\nhoneycomb\ndA\nd\nA\ndV\nτ\nτ\n+\n=\n, (Eq.26)\n\nwhere the base area is 15\" x 18\" or 1.875 square feet with an error of 0.010 square feet,\nand the final cushion thickness is approximated to be 2.5\" or .208 feet with an error of\n0.0483 feet. This yields a volume error of 0.047 cubic feet and results in an 11% error in\nvolume based on the approximate final cushion thickness and payload base.\nThe error in predeployment volume for the expanding foam material is more\ndifficult to calculate without physical access to the Instapak foam bags. However, the\npre-deployment volume will be integer multiples of the unexpanded foam bag volume.\nIt appears that each foam bag expands to approximately 3 or 4 inches in thickness,\nwhich would likely make the effect of a 0.5 inch error small.\nThe experiment primary hypothesis states that expanding foam occupies at least\n75% less pre-deployment volume than paper honeycomb. In order to definitively\nevaluate this metric to an accuracy such that the hypothesis can be assessed, we must\nshow one of two results:\n1) To prove the hypothesis true, we must show that the pre-deployment volume of\nexpanding foam is at least 86% less than the pre-deployment volume of paper\nhoneycomb.\n\n2) To disprove the hypothesis, we must show that the pre-deployment volume of\nexpanding foam is at most 64% less than the pre-deployment volume of paper\nhoneycomb.\n\nThis analysis was carried out using estimated values for crush efficiency, two\nstandard deviations from the peak acceleration distribution mean, and final cushion\nthickness. Once the experiment has been conducted, this analysis can be updated with\nexperimental values for these quantities.\n\n11.2.3 Summary of Error Analysis Implications for Proving/Disproving Primary\nHypothesis\nThe first metric in the primary hypothesis states that expanding foam occupies at\nleast 75% less pre-deployment volume than paper honeycomb. In order to definitively\nevaluate this metric to an accuracy such that the hypothesis can be assessed, we must\nshow one of two results:\n1) To prove the hypothesis true, we must show that the pre-deployment volume of\nexpanding foam is at least 86% less than the pre-deployment volume of paper\nhoneycomb.\n2) To disprove the hypothesis, we must show that the pre-deployment volume of\nexpanding foam is at most 64% less than the pre-deployment volume of paper\nhoneycomb.\n\nThe second metric in the primary hypothesis states that expanding foam has a crush\nefficiency of no more than 30% less than honeycomb's crush efficiency. In order to\ndefinitively evaluate this metric to an accuracy such that the hypothesis can be assessed,\nwe must show one of two results:\n1) To prove the hypothesis true, we must show that the crush efficiency of\nexpanding foam is no more than 26.25% less than the crush efficiency of paper\nhoneycomb.\n\n2) To disprove the hypothesis, we must show that the crush efficiency of\nexpanding foam is more than 33.75% less than the crush efficiency of paper\nhoneycomb.\n\n12.0 Project Planning\n\n12.1 Budget\n\nThe budget required to carry out this experiment totals $553.90 and is\nsummarized in Table 7.\n\nTable 7: Budget\nPart, Material, Instrumentation to\nbe Purchased\nQuantity\nPrice ($)\n72\" long, 1/2\" diameter shafts for\nrails\n\n83.94\nInstapak Quick Foam Packaging\nbags\n2 cartons of\n48 bags\n263.00\n9\" by 12\" Instapak Quick Warmer\n(18 bag capacity)\n189.00\n1\" by 1\" thick bass wood blocks\n5 pieces, 1\nft long each\n10.00\n3000 ml Beaker with 50 ml\nincrements\n7.92\nTotal\n\n553.90\n\n12.2 Detailed Schedule for Fall Term 16.622\nThe fall term 16.622 schedule mandates that a maximum of ten and a half weeks\nbe devoted to data collection. The project detailed schedule includes goals for all ten\nand a half weeks with weeks of high workload interspersed with weeks of light\nworkload. This provides a scheduling buffer in case of project delays and will help in\nbalancing the 16.622 workload with other class work. The last few weeks of the fall\nterm are devoted to drafting a Jointly Authored Paper and preparing a Final Oral\nPresentation.\nThe 16.622 general project schedule is presented in Table 8.

A two foot by two foot\nby seven foot tall area will be needed near the Strongwall to set up the drop-test rig. An\nadditional five foot by five foot floor space will be necessary to set up instrumentation\nfor data acquisition. The expertise of John Kane will be necessary in familiarizing with\nthe Instron force press in TELAC, and the expertise of Richard Perdichizzi will be\nhelpful in constructing the test rig apparatus and setting up instrumentation.\n\n13.0 Project Summary\n\nThe purpose of this experiment is to evaluate the material properties of\nexpanding foam as an impact attenuator for the small payloads deployed from\nunmanned aerial vehicles. By quantifying nominal pre-deployment volumes and crush\nefficiencies of expanding foam and honeycomb, this experiment is the first step in\nassessing the viability of using expanding foam as an inexpensive and reliable low-\nimpact attenuator.\n\n14.0 List of References\n\n1 Gardinerier, D., Yanagihara, M., Kobayashi, T., and Amito, A., \"Design and Testing\nof the HOPE-X HSFD-II Landing System,\" AIAA Journal, Vol. A01-29285, 2001,\npp.304-310.\n\n2 Brown, G., Haggard, R., \"Parachute Retraction Soft-Landing Systems Using\nPneumatic Muscle Actuators,\" AIAA Journal, Vol. A00-37300, 2000, pp.1-9.\n\n3 Sealed Air Corporation, \"Instapak Quick Foam Packaging,\"\nhttp://www.instapakquick.com/products/protective/instapak/quick/instapakquick_works\n.html,\nMarch 20, 2003.\n\n4 Pactiv Corporation, \"Hexacomb Cushion-Comb Products,\"\nhttp://www.pactiv.com/pactivframe.asp?page=/cgi-\nbin/mkpage2.pl?101/205/314&menu=/101/205/314/menu.asp?active=btn1,\nMarch 20, 2003.\n\n5 Brown, R., \"Short-term Stress-Strain Properties,\" Handbook of Plastics Test Methods,\n3rd ed., Wiley, New York, 1988, pp.161.\n\nAppendix A: Detailed Drawings of Apparatus\n\n(next four pages)\n\nAppendix B: Detailed Parts List\n\nBorrowed Parts, Tools and Materials\nquantity\nWinch\nPulley\nQuick release\nRope wire\n30 ft\nMcMaster shaft supports\nMcMaster Ball Bearings\n2lb and 5lb Weights\n45 lb\n21\" by 48\" by 0.7\" plywood\n1 board\nSaw\nDrill\nHammer\n0.25\" thick aluminum sheet for blinder\nMetal L to mount photo-gates\nDuct tape\n2 rolls\nIndustrial adhesive\nScrews for shaft supports\nScrews for ball bearings\nScrews to bolt weights\n1 1/2\" long Wood screws\n1/2\" thick Paper Honeycomb (Hexacomb 700 from Pactiv Corporation)\n4 sheets 96\" by 48\"\n1\" thick Paper Honeycomb (Hexacomb 700 from Pactiv Corporation)\n8 sheets 96\" by 48\"\nUnistrut Metal Framing(r) components\n\nUnistrut channelled sections with smooth faces\n2 beams >= 25\"\n\n4 beams >= 19\"\n\n1 beams >= 14\"\nSpring nuts\nFittings\nI-beams\nBorrowed Instrumentation\n\nAccelerometer\nHigh-Speed camera\nPhoto-gates and digital timer\n1 set\nAnalog to Digital board for accelerometer\nComputers for data acquisition\nRuler\n\nAppendix C: Specification Sheet For Purchases\n\nPart, Material,\nInstrumentation to be\nPurchased\nQuantit\ny\nPurchase Specification\nSuppliers\n72\" long, 1/2\" diameter\nshafts for rails\n\nMcMaster Carr Catalog\nNumber 6061K93\norder from\nMcMaster.com\nInstapak Quick Foam\nPackaging bags\ncartons\nof 48\nbags\nSealedAir Corporation\nCatalog Number\nIQH0000-10\nChiswick Trading\n(Tel. 1 800 225 8708)\n9\" by 12\" Instapak\nQuick Warmer (18 bag\ncapacity)\nSealedAir Corporation\nCatalog Number\nIQW0000-15\nChiswick Trading\n\n1\" by 1\" thick bass\nwood blocks\npieces,\n1 ft long\neach\nNot Applicable\nPearl Arts and Crafts\nStores\n3000 ml Beaker with 50\nml increments\nMcMaster Carr Catalog\nNumber 9896T4\norder from\nMcMaster.com"

Bennett\nPage 1\nCourtesy of Warren Bennett. Used with permission.\n\n1/30/2003\nExecutive Summary\nIce screws are protection devices that allow climbers to anchor themselves to ice. This\nproject is a response to the current lack of any controlled testing procedure for ice\nscrews, and the perceived margin for improvement of ice screw design and usage in the\nfield. This project develops a quantitative, repeatable test methodology for ice screws.\nThis project is of value to the technical and the climbing community because it will\ncreate a methodology for making 'climbing ice' types in the lab. The project will provide\ndata on current safety standards of ice climbing equipment. It is also hoped that this\nstudy will reduce the failure rate in ice climbing by being the first step towards the\nimprovement of such protective equipment, and in educating climbers about the limits\nof their equipment and how to use that equipment most effectively.\nThis project replicates natural ice formations in the laboratory by testing a set of\nmethodologies of ice manufacture and analyzing the ice specimens obtained through a\nseries of prescribed measurements. The objective is to obtain two distinctly different types\nof ice. Once repeatable ice formation has been achieved, the variables affecting ice\nscrew safety can be tested in the test bed. All testing will occur on the MTS machine\nfound in\nTELAC\n(Technology Laboratory for Advanced Composites). Statistical\ntechniques will be used in the processing and presentation of data, and in evaluating\nthe level of success of the project.\nThe projected budget for the project is $2,884. The bulk of expenditure is the purchase of\nthe ice screws themselves at $50 per screw. It is hoped that sponsorship for this aspect of\nthe project will be found through negotiations with equipment manufacturers.\nThe project schedule indicates that data collection will be completed in week 9, two\nweeks before the end of data collection in 622. This gives 2 weeks of leeway before the\nfinal day to collect data in 16.622 for potential problems.\nW.

Ever since Yvon\nChouinard introduced the first rigid crampons and curved ice picks in the late 1960's,\nclimbers have been refining techniques and developing equipment in order to push the\nlimits of ice climbing (see Figure 1).\nFigure 1: Illustrating a climber on an ice face*\nOne of the current limitations on ice climbing is the strength of the anchors that the\nclimbers use. Current research into better protection is based on anecdotal evidence\nand lacks a controlled methodology for test or evaluation. Ice screws are the main\nprotection type; thus, for the purposes of this investigation, the focus is solely on ice\nscrews.\n* photograph taken by Luca Marinelli, exhibited courtesy of project adv isor, David Custer.\nW. Bennett\nPage 6\n\n1/30/2003\nIce screws are pieces of climbing safety gear that are used as anchors on a route. This\nroute can be led (when the climber places his own protection on the route) or top-roped\n(a rope anchored at the top of the climb). The climber is then attached to the screw by\na carabiner through the hanger and is thus anchored to the climbing face. Figure 2\nbelow shows an ice screw.\nScrew\nHanger\nFigure 2: An ice screw\nThe ice screw itself consists of a hollow screw that is turned into the ice by use of a\n'hanger' on its end. The screw first 'bites' the ice with a set of sharp, beveled teeth; as it is\nturned the ice is forced out through the center of the hollow screw. In order to reduce\nfriction, both the inside surface and outside threaded surface of the screw are machined\nto be smooth. The screw is usually in the range of 10-22 cm long and has a diameter of 17\nmm, the hanger is typically around 8 cm long. Screws can be made from steel or\ntitanium.\nIce screws provide effective anchoring, if placed properly, but, like all protection\ndevices, they are subject to the changeable nature of the ice environment. Proper\nW. Bennett\nPage 7\n\n1/30/2003\nplacement is defined as placing the screw in good ice and at an orientation that allows\nthe loading to be held by the screw threads, so the load path runs the length of the\nscrew.\nThe essence of good ice protection is speed and reliability. The gear must be placed in\ntens of seconds to minimize climb-time and thus fatigue. It must also sustain the forces\nproduce in the event of a fall (around 10 kN).\nExisting research is lacking in the area of ice protection technology. There a few\ndocumented tests in the public domain, but these tests have not been sufficiently\ncontrolled. The statistics from these tests, notably the Harmston, Luebben study in 19971\nand the study commissioned by Black Diamond,2 lead to the conclusion that there is\nroom for improvement in ice protection performance.\nThere have been numerous papers into the study of ice mechanics and also into the\nstudy of the rheological nature of ice. This forms the basis of the literature review in\nsection 3.\n1.2 Summary of Project\nThe motivation for this project is twofold. Firstly, the poor performance of ice screws in\nexisting tests. Secondly, the lack of repeatability of the existing tests. It is believed that\nwith a standardized testing procedure, ice protection improvement will be possible.\nThe project goals are, first, to produce a realistic simulation of the ice in the lab, and,\nsecond, to test the factors that affect the safety of ice screws and their placement. In\norder to realize this project, the procedure is:\n1)\nInvestigate and understand ice types and their formation\n2)\nDevelop a method of repeatably replicating the ice flows\n3)\nDevelop a controlled methodology for testing the factors that affect the\nsafety of the placement of ice screws.\nSuccessful completion of the primary goal will permit controlled testing and evaluation of\nice screws and will allow the industry to initiate standardized testing of ice protection,\nW. Bennett\nPage 8\n\n1/30/2003\n1.3 Value to Technical and Climbing Community\nThis project is of value to the technical and the climbing community because it will\ncreate a methodology for making \"climbing ice\" types in the lab. There is no data\navailable on repeatable ice formation processes for testing ice-climbing equipment in\nthe public domain. If ice is effectively simulated in the laboratory, the industry will be\ncloser to setting safety standards and thus providing safer protection for climbers\neverywhere. An inexpensive, reliable and realistic lab-based testing method for ice\nprotection would give strong support to the development of ice protection beyond its\npresent state.\nIf the first part of the experiment is fulfilled, then this project will go on to provide data on\ncurrent safety standards of ice climbing equipment. It is also hoped that this study will\nreduce the failure rate in ice climbing by being the first step in educating climbers about\nthe limits of their equipment and how to use that equipment most effectively.\nW. Bennett\nPage 9\n\n1/30/2003\n2. Statement of Project\nPrimary Hypothesis:\nThe structure and morphology of different types of ice formations can be characterized\nand simulated in a lab to provide a \"test bed\" useful for assessment of ice screws.\nSecondary Hypothesis:\nIf the above hypothesis is true, then using the simulated ice, the variables affecting screw\nplacement safety can be determined.\nThe objectives are then, firstly, to develop a repeatable means of reproducing ice in a\nlab and to characterize this ice using rheological data or to understand why ice cannot\nbe simulated in the lab, and secondly, to use this ice model to test simulated falls on ice\nscrews in a manner closely related to climbing conditions.\nThe success criteria that will be used to measure the project are:\n1)\na) If hypothesis 1 is true, then success is characterizing the critical rheological\nproperties of ice.\nb) If hypothesis 1 is false, then success is identifying why ice cannot be made\nsuccessfully.\n2)\na)\nIf hypothesis 2 is true, then success is the development of a test for ice\nscrew safety that produces consistent data and repeatable data.\nb)\nIf hypothesis 2 is false, then success is identifying why ice screw\nperformance cannot be characterized.\nW. Bennett\nPage 10\n\n1/30/2003\n3. Literature Review\nThe three topics of the literature review cover: the understanding of ice, ice testing\nresults, and ice screw testing.\n3.1 Understanding Ice\nThis section covers ice structure, ice formation, and the micro mechanics of ice failure\n3.1.1 Ice Structure\nIce is close to melting at the temperatures at which it is encountered in climbing (around\n0o, according to the Harmston and Luebben study1). As such, it is a 'high temperature'\nmaterial that exhibits a wide variety of behavior that is dependent on a number of\nfactors. Ice can creep with little applied stress, or it can fracture in a brittle manner. Thus,\nclassical solutions do not work for analysis of ice; it is neither a 'simple elastic' nor an\n'elastic/plastic' solid. Instead, specific methods for its characterization must be\nundertaken.\nAccording to Schulson3, ice has 12 different crystallographic structures and 2 amorphous\nstates. The particular structure formed most commonly in nature is the Ih-type. This is\nformed by simply freezing water and has a hexagonal structure (see Figure 3).\nFigure 3: A schematic crystal structure of Ih ice\nThe oxygen atom is strongly covalenty bonded to the 2 hydrogens to form a single water\nmolecule, but, when frozen, the water molecules themselves are bonded weakly by\nhydrogen-bonds. Vacancies in the structure are predominantly point defects. It is these,\nW. Bennett\nPage 11\n\n1/30/2003\nalong with the dislocation density (the number of grain boundaries per unit volume), that\ndetermines the characteristics of the ice. The microstructure of the ice depends on its\nmechanical-thermal history.\n3.1.2 Ice Formation (morphology)\nThere are 3 main ways of forming natural ice:\n1.\nHeterogeneous nucleation at the surface of a slowly flowing water body.\n2.\nNucleation of frazil (Fine spicules, plates or discoids of ice suspended in water)\nparticles that appear in a fast flowing, supercooled water masses.\n3.\nThe freeze up of snow or atmospheric ice nuclei falling into the water.\nThese starting points for ice formation must considered in the context of producing ice in\na laboratory.\n3.1.3 Micromechanics of Failure\nAccording to Wu & Niu4, the main reason for ice failure is due to impurities at grain\nboundaries disrupting the overall structure. These impurities initiate early melting and\nmicrocracks. The grain structure and orientation also affects the failure mode. This\ninformation is important to how the macroscopic ice structure is controlled (by addition\nof impurities for example).\n3. 2 Ice Testing Results\nThis section of the literature review focuses on the methods used to characterize the\nengineering properties of ice.\n3.2.1 Compressive Strength\nThe benchmark for compressive strength is set by uni-axial load tests on specimens in\nlaboratories5. There have been numerous studies carried out on the ice in situ but analysis\nof these tests was hampered by the complex stress states set up within the ice.\nTypical values for the range of compressive strength are from 0.5 - 10 Mpa.\nW. Bennett\nPage 12\n\n1/30/2003\n3.2.2 Flexural Strength\nFlexural strength is generally lower than the compressive strength for ice and typically\nranges from 0.5-3 Mpa. It should be noted that the temperature up to -5oC did not\ninfluence the flexural strength of the specimen.\n3.2.3 Ice Rheology\nThe stress-strain behavior of ice is important to understand as it has relevance to any\nstudy involving ice as a working material.5 In a general sense, ice is described as a\nviscoelastic material. The simple spring dashpot model for ice is shown in figure 4 below.\nThis model attempts to simulate the 4 deformation mechanisms of ice:\n1.\nElastic deformation due to atomic bonds changing length.\n2.\nDelayed elasticity due to sliding at the grain boundaries.\n3.\nViscous deformation due to dislocation movement within grains.\n4.\nDeformation due to microcracks in the ice.\nThe total strain of the ice is usually thought of as the sum of all these components. This\nmodel allows for both the creep of the ice, and the ductile to brittle transition, as strain\nrates are increased. The fourth point is the most important in relation to the project as the\nice screw itself initiates many microcracks, and the primary reason for ice failure is the\npropagation of those cracks.\nFigure 4: A spring and dashpot model of ice.6\nThe values of the spring and dashpot constants are dependent on a number of factors\nincluding the structure and temperature of the ice.\nW. Bennett\nPage 13\n\n1/30/2003\n3.2.4 Temperature Dependency\nIt has been shown that, at temperatures up to -5oC, the flexural strength of the specimen\nis not influenced by temperature.5,7 However at temperatures near zero, it was the\nimpurities at the grain boundaries that induced melting which meant that even the\nflexural strength of thick ice was zero. This change in behavior important for the project\nas this indicates a marked change in behavior around the temperatures of interest.\n3.2.5 Impact Testing on Ice\nA further study of particular relevance to the ice screw testing section of this project are\na series of drop impact tests on laboratory and natural freshwater ice7 conducted in the\nlate 1960s by the Artic and Antarctic research Institute (AARI) and then again by the\nNational Research Council of Canada (NRC) in the late 1980's.\nBoth tests consisted of dropping specially prepared 'impacters' of hemispherical surface\nof weights between 30 and 300kg onto the test surfaces from heights ranging from 0.02\nto 1.6m metres. The measurements taken were the size of the imprint and acceleration\nrecord for the AARI tests, and the maximum pressure and penetration depth (taken using\npressure transducers) in the NRC tests (from this the acceleration record could be\ncalculated).\nThe results of these tests were compared to a hydrodynamic model. The model assumes\nthat a thin layer of crushed ice develops during impact between the indenting body and\nthe undamaged ice, and that its flow is similar to that of a thin layer of viscous fluid. The\nfindings of this study most relevant to the project are:\n1.\nThe energy of mechanical crushing of ice depends on the ice state. This energy\nwas up to 7 times more for cold winter ice in comparison to warm spring ice. The\ncritical temperature was -5?C, either side of this the ice properties were\nsignificantly different. This agrees with the observation made in section 3.2.4.\n2.\nAnalysis of test data showed that, within the considered interval of impact\nvelocities, impact crushing strength of freshwater ice decreased with increasing\nimpact velocities linearly.\nW. Bennett\nPage 14\n\n1/30/2003\n3.\nTheoretical predictions of maximum ice load and depth of penetration, based on\nthe hydrodynamic model coincide closely with experimental data.\nThese findings indicate that a theoretical model can predict some properties of ice to a\nvery high accuracy.\nHowever, the same model may not always predict different\nquantities to the same accuracy.\nThis impact testing is of direct relevance to our project because we expect impact results\nto correlate closely with ice screw performance.\nThis study is limited as it was carried out in an uncontrolled environment.\n3.3 How to make Ice\nInformation on the making of the ice was gathered, via email, from a current expert in\nthe field of ice mechanics, John Dempsey.8 Full details on 'how to make (perfect) ice' is\nfound in Appendix A. Appendix A gives information on test apparatus insulation, tips on\nrepeatable crystal growth (such as the use of existing frost particles to nucleate ice grains\nin the specimen), and it also gives advice on how to allow for the expansion of the water\non freezing. As indicated above, this will only produce one ice type, the most perfect ice\nthat we can make. The methods for making other types of ice will be investigated in the\npreliminary testing stage, section 5.1.1.\n3.4 Ice Screw Testing\nTwo studies are relevant to Stage 2 of this project:\n3.4.1 The Harmston/Luebben Study\nHarmston and Luebben1 conducted tests that consist of placing ice screws into a natural\nice formation and dropping a 185 lb weight from various heights, while statically\nattached to the protection point, giving forces of between 8 kN - 12 kN. The results from\nthis test show that the screw ripped out of the ice 7 out of 12 times. A variety of variables\nwere tested, including screw angle and screw length. The tests suggest that a downward\nangle for the screw is most effective and that a longer screw is more likely to hold than a\nshorter screw. The main conclusion drawn from the test was that ice conditions are so\nvariable that it is difficult to accurately predict the holding strength of ice screw\nplacement.\nW. Bennett\nPage 15\n\n1/30/2003\nA critical examination of the test conditions suggest that many independent variables,\nincluding temperature, sun exposure and ice quality, were not controlled. Also, the\nuncontrolled method of dropping a weight onto the ice screw had no control over the\nstrain rate.\n3.4.2 Black Diamond internal study\nBlack Diamond Equipment has made its own investigations into ice screw effectiveness.2\nThe tests consist of placing ice screws into an ice cell and then loading these cells in a\nUniversal Test Machine. The ice cells are constrained by a steel container and prepared\nusing untreated tap water. Freezing of the cells was at around -10oC and the whole\nprocess took about 72 hours. Ice cells are regenerated 20 times, by simply filling in the\ndamaged hole and refreezing, before being regenerated.\nIt was found in this study that the ice screws tested failed either by levering the hanger\noff the screw head, by breaking of the screw shaft, or by pulling the screw out of the ice.\nIt was also found that the screw placement angle was a significant factor in how much\nload the ice screw could withstand.\nThe limitations on this study are the unpredictable and variable nature of the ice cells\nused for testing. The cell composition was not tightly controlled and regeneration of the\ncell is not consistent.\n3.5 Summary\nIce failure occurs due to impurities initiating cracks on a microscopic level. There is a\nbrittle-elastic behavior change as ice passes through -5oC.\nIt has been found that, when subjected to loading in certain conditions, ice screws fail at\nloads that they are designed to hold. Current research in the area of ice screw testing\nlacks a controlled procedure for the repeatable testing of ice screws in ice. A study that\nregulates not only the ice screw testing but also the ice into which the screw is\nembedded would be beneficial to this area of research.\nW. Bennett\nPage 16\n\n1/30/2003\n4. Technical Approach\nThis project adds to the knowledge base on the subject of ice screw testing by providing\na controlled test environment. This study will bring quantifiable and repeatable results to\nthe field of ice screw testing.\nThere are two distinct stages in the experimental setup of this project:\n\n- The characterization of ice.\n- The testing of ice screws in ice.\nThe main challenge is to repeatably create the structure and morphology of ice in the\nlab. Once the ice formations can be created in a laboratory, a realistic testing method\ncan be devised. The major hurdle is in creating the different types of ice encountered by\nclimbers. These ice types range from good ice (pure, transparent and crack free) which\nis thought to be the safest, to hollow, layered, slushy, aerated and chandeliered which\nare all thought to be poor ice types for screw placement. This descriptive basis for the ice\nis then converted to quantitative properties based on analysis. Not all the ice types can\nbe created and tested owing to the timescale of 16.622. Therefore, two ice types were\nchosen (see section 5.1.1 for further details).\nThe first step towards a controlled methodology for ice screw testing is thus the ability to\ncharacterize the ice and make it consistently. This step entails defining a process and\nthen being able to test the ice for certain properties and gaining repeatable results.\nOnce the ice test-beds have been developed so they are representative of climbing\nconditions, the ice screws can be tested. Initially, the screws will be tested on 'perfect'\n(flawless) ice. Comparisons between with results from the previous tests (Harmston and\nLuebben1 and the Black Diamond study2) will be conducted. This is the control. When\ntesting the ice screws, the independent variable will be the screw placement angle. The\nvariables chosen are to be limited owing to the time-scale of the course.\nW. Bennett\nPage 17\n\n1/30/2003\n5. Experimental Design\n5.1 Basic Concepts\nThis section explains the planned experimental procedures for the project.\n5.1.1 Preliminary Testing\nThis stage involves experimenting with different types of ice and finding the most\neffective method of creating repeatable ice. To this end, possible methods for making\nthe different kinds of ice will be investigated. The factors under test will be air and\nimpurity concentrations in the ice, the critical levels of which will be obtained. One\nparticular issue to be addressed is the effective production of distinctly different types of\nice (based on their properties).\nFrom this preliminary testing module, two different types of ice, named ABS1, and ABS2\n(Alziati & Bennett Standard #) will have been obtained. It is hoped to produce a sample\nof 'perfect' ice (few cracks, no aeration, no particulates), and a sample of either\naerated ice, or 'dirty' ice (high particulate concentration).\nThe potential strategies for creating the aerated ice are as follows:\n1. Drill air holes into the ice.\n2. To use a mixture of crushed ice and water close to freezing point.\n3. Suspend small pockets of air in the ice mix (using tethered balloons)\n4. Construction of a specialized rig that constantly blows air through the ice mix.\n5. The use of soda water or carbonated water.\n6. A combination of these strategies.\nThe most effective method for creating aerating ice will be determined during the\npreliminary testing stage of the project. The method will be chosen based on the best\ncombination of speed, ease of production, and quality of ice produced.\nThe creation of these 'bad' types of ice is not a widely documented subject. Hence, it is\nextremely difficult to say exactly how the specimens will be made. However, limited\npreliminary testing of 'bad' ice during the Fall Semester 2002 has yielded some interesting\ndiscoveries. Encouraging results have been obtained in making small-scale formations\nwith carbonated water.\nW. Bennett\nPage 18\n\n1/30/2003\nOne further decision to be investigated during preliminary testing is the size of the ice\nspecimen. The specimen must be large enough to have a screw inserted into its body\nand not show any visible signs of stress, and it must be small enough to carry manually.\nA further option for ice production is the purchase of prefabricated ice.\n5.1.2 Stage 1: The Characterization of Ice\nThis stage will consist of testing the mechanical properties of the two different types of ice\nproduced, named ABS1 and ABS2. The methodology for creating these ice types\neffectively will have been developed in the preliminary testing. Each ice type will have\nproperties that are measured to be significantly different. The objective of this stage is to\ncharacterize each ice type in terms of its physical and mechanical properties.\nFirst, the physical properties of the ice produced (density, purity) will be measured. The\ndensity will be calculated by measuring the volume and the weight directly; the volume\nitself will be measured by recording the amount of water the specimen displaces. Purity\nwill be measured by weighing the mass of particulate added to the water before\nfreezing. Second, to characterize the ice specimens mechanically, specimens will be put\nunder standard tensile and compressive tests in an MTS machine (see figures 5, 6 and 7).\nAs shown in figure 6, the tensile test plates will be frozen into the ice specimen and then\npulled. A notch will be machined into the specimen to ensure that failure does not occur\nat the plate/ice interface. The MTS machine will apply a gradually increasing force until\nthe failure occurs. For the compressive test, the ice specimen will be placed between\nthe plates of the MTS machine, and a compressive force will be applied, as shown in\nfigure 7. For the characterization stage, the cylindrical ice specimen dimensions will be 10\ncm diameter and 15 cm in length.\nFrom these tests the material properties of tensile strength, and compressive strength will\nbe measured directly. The Young's Modulus will also be evaluated from the results of the\ntests. A computer records the displacement, load, and time data from the MTS machine.\nW.

For this test a heavy steel ball will\nbe dropped from a fixed height onto the ice surface. The radius of indentation will then\nbe measured and the impact toughness can be calculated. An illustration of this is\nshown in Figure 8.\nIndentation width\nSteel Ball\nFigure 8: Impact testing\nW. Bennett\nPage 21\n\n1/30/2003\nTesting of each specimen will be carried out at two different temperatures either side of\nthe critical -5?C temperature where the ice properties change from elastic to brittle.\nThe making of each specimen will be carried out according to a combination of both\nthe recipe prescribed by Dempsey8 (please see appendix A) and of the processes\nexamined in the preliminary experimentation.\n5.1.2 Stage 2: Testing of Ice Screws in Ice\nOnce the ice types have been produced and mechanical characteristics measured, the\neffect of placement angle on ice screw safety will be tested on each ice type (see figure\n8). Each of these tests will be conducted at values of -15?, 0?, and 15? of ice screw angle\nplacement. This angle is measured relative to the perpendicular of the ice face, where\npositive is above and negative below (as illustrated in figure 9). The loading of the\nspecimens in the MTS machine will be under two regimes:\n- Impact Strength\nThe impact strength will measured by fast loading of the screw. The load rate will\nbe at 10kN per second, which is the approximate load rate of a falling climber.\nThis will be increased until failure.\n- Low load rate\nThis regime is at a low load rate of around 0.1kN per second (a factor of 100\nbelow the Impact Strength regime above).\nW. Bennett\nPage 22\n\n1/30/2003\nFigure 9: Ice screw placement angle\nThese ice screw tests will be carried out in an MTS machine (figure 5). A computer will\nrecord the displacement, load, and time data.\nThe rig that will hold the cylindrical ice specimen in place during testing is shown in figure\n10. The rig consists of a piece of sheet steel folded into a configuration that will give\nmaximum contact area over the ice/steel interface. For a detailed plan of the mounting\napparatus please see Appendix B. The specimen will be placed inside this large angle\nand strapped on using canvas ties and ratchets. The ties will also support the ice against\npremature cracking when the ice screw is placed in the end of the specimen. Then the\nentire apparatus will be screwed onto the steel base plate of the MTS machine. The ice\nscrew will be attached to the MTS ram by means of clamps (see Appendix C).\nW. Bennett\nPage 23\n\n1/30/2003\nHolding\nStraps\nIce Specimen\nSteel Sheet\nIce Screw\nAluminium Angles\nFigure 10: Showing the rig for securing the ice specimen during stage 2.\nIt should be noted that a new ice screw will be used for every test. Identical ice screws\nwill be used for all experiments.\nFor this stage of the experimentation the dimensions of the ice specimen will be around\n30 cm in diameter and 40 cm in length. However, as stated before, the exact dimensions\nhave yet to be determined in the preliminary testing stage.\nW. Bennett\nPage 24\n\n1/30/2003\n5.2 Error Analysis\nThe main source of error comes from the unpredictable nature of ice fracture. This will be\nhandled with the use of statistics (see section 6.2). Before applying the statistical analysis\ntechniques, the systematic errors must be identified. This will leave only data variation\ndue to the unpredictable nature of ice.\nThe errors associated with this project are located mainly in the measurements that will\nbe taken throughout testing. The greatest source of error lies in the MTS loading machine,\nwhich is accurate to a tolerance of ±13N. At a testing load of 2kN this represents an error\nof 0.65%, which is very small.\nOther possible errors are associated with the measurement of length, temperature and\nvolume and mass:\n- Lengths: The MTS machine quotes measurements to an accuracy of ±0.1 mm. This\nequates to an error of 0. 5-1 % based on lengths of possible ice screw movement.\n- Temperatures: Temperatures are measured to an accuracy of one decimal\nplace using a thermocouple and digital readout. The errors associated with this\nare 0.5 - 2.5 %.\n- Volume measurements will be made by recording the amount of water\ndisplaced by the ice specimen. The errors associated with this are 0.5%\n- Mass will be measured using an electronic balance accurate to 3 decimal\nplaces. The errors associated with this are small enough to be neglected\ncompletely.\nTherefore the total probable error in this project is around 5 %.\nW. Bennett\nPage 25\n\n1/30/2003\n5.3 Test Matrices\nThe test matrices for the project are laid out below with details on the dependent and\nindependent variables. Owing to the erratic behavior of ice, all characterization and ice\nscrew tests will be repeated 4 times, and statistical techniques applied to obtain the\n'true' values, thus the blocks in the test matrices represent 4 data points.\n5.3.1 Stage 1: Production of Ice and Testing of its Mechanical Characteristics\nThe independent and dependent variables for stage 1 are listed below. These are\nfollowed by a diagram of the test matrix for this stage.\nThe measurements taken in this stage will occur in 2 different modes:\nFirstly, the identification measurements will be taken:\n1. Mass of ice formed (kg)\n2. Volume of ice formed (m 3)\n3. Mass of impurity dissolved in water (kg)\nSecondly, the measurements taken from the tensile, compressive and impact tests will be\nthe following:\nIndependent Variables\nThe controlled variables in this stage are:\n1.\nTemperature of ice: initially two values will be set at -2?C and -10?C, but may be\nsubject to change according to the refrigeration unit's capabilities.\n2.\nIce type will be changed: ABS1, and ABS2 will be tested at each of the above\ntemperatures.\nDependent Variables\nThe values that will be measured from the tests at this stage are:\n1. Stress level at tensile fracture (N m-2)\n2. Stress level at compressive fracture (N m-2)\n3. Extension of the ice specimen after fracture (m) [Tensile and compressive tests]\n4. Depth and radius of indent (m) [Impact test]\nW. Bennett\nPage 26\n\n1/30/2003\nFigure 11: Test matrix for stage 1 (each block consists of 4 data points).\n5.3.2 Stage 2: Testing of Ice Screws in Ice\nThe independent and dependent variables for stage 2 are listed below. These are\nfollowed by a diagram of the test matrix for this stage.\nIndependent Variables\nThe controlled variables in this stage are:\n1. The screw angle will be varied between +15 degrees and -15 degrees.\n2. Ice type will be changed: ABS1 and ABS2 will be tested at each screw angle.\nDependent Variables\nThe values that will be measured at this stage are:\n1.

Bennett\nPage 27\n\n1/30/2003\nFigure 12: test matrix for stage 2 (each block consists of 4 data points).\n5.4 Safety Concerns\nThe major safety concern connected to working with subzero materials is that prolonged\nexposure can lead to frostbite. To avoid this, gloves will be worn when handling ice.\nIt is also expected that the ice specimens will be of considerable size and weight. Hence\nwhen moving these specimens, caution must be exercised to avoid back injury.\nLastly, ice is a brittle material and will facture on impact. Thus, safety goggles should be\nworn when testing the ice, to protect against flying ice chips. Also, shielding will be set up\naround the test specimen.\nDuring all experimentation TELAC (The MIT Technology Laboratory for Advanced\nComposites ) safety procedures will be followed.\nW. Bennett\nPage 28\n\n1/30/2003\n6. Data Analysis\n6.1 Data Processing\n6.1.1 Stage 1: Production of Ice and Testing of its Mechanical Characteristics\nData processing in stage 1 will involve the use of equations 1 and 2 to provide the value\nof the Young's Modulus, E,. The MTS computer will give the values of the force applied at\nfailure via a digital read-out. The only processing that must be done here is dividing this\nforce by the cross-sectional area of the plane of failure to obtain a value of the stress\nlevel, ?x.\n? l\n? x\n? x ?\n[1]\nE ? ?\n[2]\nl\nx\n6.1.2 Stage 2: Testing of Ice Screws in Ice\nData processing from stage 2 will comprise recording MTS digital read-out of forces at\nfailure. After error analysis and accounting for offset measures, these are the values that\nwill be quoted in the experimental results.\n6.2 Data Reduction\nTo reduce the data, a statistical approach will be taken. Owing to the random nature of\nthe behavior of ice, each individual test will have to be repeated a certain number of\ntimes so that statistical techniques can be used. The experiments will be repeated four\ntimes only, due to time constraints. Ideally, good results would yield a standard deviation\nsmaller than the mean value and a skewness of the same order of magnitude as the\nstandard deviation.\nTo illustrate this point, figure 13 shows some distributions that might be expected. If the\nscatter graph for the experiments looks like graph 1 in Figure 13, then no more\nexperiments need to be carried out. If, however, the scatter of data is similar to graph 2,\nthen the number of experiments should be increased in order to reduce the standard\ndeviation. Unfortunately, as stated before, this could prove difficult owing to the time\nconstraints. The problem is balancing the need for statistical significance with the time\navailable.\nW. Bennett\nPage 29\n\n1/30/2003\nFigure 13: Graphs showing scattered normal distributions\n1) Low standard deviation\n2) High standard deviation\n6.2.1 Stage 1:\nThe mean and the standard deviation of the results will be taken. The values obtained\nwill be fitted to a normal distribution and the confidence level of the values for tensile\nand compressive strength, E, and impact strength will be ascertained. Further statistical\nmeasures that will be investigated are the mean square value and the t-statistic test.\nThese tests will indicate the consistency of the data and hence the level of success in\nachieving repeatability in the results.\n6.2.2 Stage 2:\nAgain the mean and the standard deviation of the data obtained will be obtained and\nfitted to a normal distribution to obtain a confidence level for each test. The mean\nsquared value will be analyzed, as will the t-statistic and so the degree of confidence in\nthe distribution will be ascertained.\n6.3 Correlation\nIn order to prove the first hypothesis is correct the results of stage 1 will be analysed, and,\nif consistent, then the ice types produced have been made in a controlled repeatable\nfashion and therefore simulate ice effectively. Successful characterization is defined as\nobtaining recorded mean measurements for 'good' ice that lie within one standard\ndeviation of the quoted values in the available literature. Successful characterization of\nbad ice is defined as obtaining data with a standard deviation of the same order of\nmagnitude as that obtained for good ice. There is no data available for comparison of\npreviously recorded values.\nW. Bennett\nPage 30\n\n1/30/2003\nThe second hypothesis will be proved correct if there is a definite trend of repeatable\ndata from the various loading measurements. This will show how the placement angle\naffects ice screw safety. Repeatable data is defined as having a standard deviation of\nless than 15 % of the mean value. The data in the Black Diamond study2 had a standard\ndeviation of approximately 25 % of the mean value. It is believed that 15 % is a figure that\nwould be acceptable as an industry standard test.\nW. Bennett\nPage 31\n\n1/30/2003\n7. Project Planning\n7.1 Budget\nThe most expensive part of the budget is the ice screws. At $50 per piece, they provide\nthe bulk of the cost. To address this issue, potential sponsors, including Black Diamond,\nthe world leaders in ice screw manufacturing, have already been contacted, as can be\nseen in the schedule below. It is strongly anticipated that a sponsor will be found through\nvarious contacts in the climbing community. This will bring the cost down considerably to\naround $150.\nThe budget is summarized in the table 1. All figures are based on market costs.\nTable 1: The proposed budget\nItem\nAvailability Quantity\nReal World Cost\n16.62X Cost\nMTS Machine use\nMIT\n5 days\n$2,500\ndonated\nMachine Shop\nMIT\nUnknown\nunknown\ndonated\nTest Rig\nMIT\nUnknown\nunknown\ndonated\nRefrigerator\nMIT\nUnknown\nunknown\ndonated\nIce Screws\nOrder\n$2,700\n$2,700\nCarabiners\nOrder\n$30\n$30\nSlings\nOrder\n$24\n$24\nIce Boxes\nOrder\n$40\n$40\nBuilding Materials\nMIT/Order\n$50\n$50\nTotal:\n$5,344\n$2,884\nW.

The success of the preliminary experiment and discovery of\nsponsors will be presented in the first oral progress report on 27th of March. The ice screw\ntesting will be run in the lab for a maximum of three weeks. The project is predicted to be\nfinished by week 9. This gives 2 weeks leeway in terms of the 622 deadline for unforeseen\ncircumstances. Data analysis will then proceed until the middle of April. From then on,\npreparations will be made for the oral final report and the written final report.\nTable 2: The proposed schedule\nID\nTask Name\nStart\nEnd 16.621 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15\nShop Demonstrations\n5-Feb\n7-Feb\nConstruction\n4-Nov 15-Mar\nBuild Test Rig\n16-Feb 22-Feb\nBuild Insulating Box\n16-Feb 22-Feb\nConact sponsers\n4-Nov 15-Mar\nOrder materials\n4-Nov 15-Mar\nStage 1\n22-Oct 15-Mar\nPreliminary Testing\n22-Oct 22-Feb\nMTS Acquaintance\n9-Feb 15-Feb\nIce Testing\n23-Feb 15-Mar\nStage 2\n16-Mar\n5-Apr\nIce Screw Testing\n16-Mar\n5-Apr\nReports and Presentations\n27-Feb 13-May\nOral Progress Reports\n4-Mar\n6-Mar\nLast day to collect data\n18-Apr 18-Apr\nProgress Review\n11-Feb\n3-Apr\nFinal Presentaion\n29-Apr 1-May\nFinal Written Report\n13-May 13-May\nW. Bennett\nPage 33\n\n1/30/2003\n7.3 Facilities Required\nThe MIT Technology Laboratory for Advanced Composites (TELAC) will host all testing.\nTELAC is equipped with an MTS machine that will be used to load the ice specimens and\nice screws. The necessary refrigeration unit required to freeze the ice specimen is located\nnearby the MTS machine. Storage space for the test equipment is also required.\nRequired construction materials are steel brackets, rods, plate, and miscellaneous bolts,\nnuts, etc. for attachment. Additionally blue foam will be used to insulate the steel case.\nThe MIT Gelb laboratory contains all the necessary metal tools to construct the apparatus\nrequired. Items that must be constructed are the steel plates for the tensile loading, the\ncasing (depicted in figure 10) for holding the cylindrical ice specimen and the insulated\nbox for making the ice specimens in.\nW. Bennett\nPage 34\n\n1/30/2003\n8. Conclusion\nIn summary, this project will be a first step towards improvement in ice climbing safety\nand the education of climbers in the limitations of their equipment.\nA successful project will be the simulation of the ice in the laboratory, or the\nunderstanding of why ice cannot be effectively simulated in the laboratory. If ice can be\nsimulated in the laboratory, then the second success of the project will be the\nunderstanding of how ice screw placement angle affects safety.\n9.

I'll give it a go. What size freezer do you have?\nLarger blocks will produce better results.\nSuppose that you make up a cube of a box (quite well made so that it does not leak)\nmake it out of some softwood so that it absorbs water?? Cube of dimension N cm;\nsuppose N is something like 25. Now insulate the bottom and all sides of the box; could\njust use that blue styrofoam but make the wall thickness of the order of 12 cm.\nThis is to stop any freezing nucleation on the sides or bottom. Now fill the box with cold\nwater and put it in the freezer-prepare for leakage because the ice will try to expand\noutwards---which is why you want as much surrounding insulation as possible.\nIf you have the patience, monitor the temperature and stir that water so that\nit all cools more or less uniformly; right near freezing use some of the frost in the freezer as\nseed crystals and float the frost on top.\nThis method should give you repeatable clear blocks - the slower you grow the ice the\nbetter it will be in terms of say dislocation density etc.\nOh, almost forgot, you need a pressure release under the ice as it grows-\nlike a pipe fitted to the side at the bottom-insulated or wrapped in heat\ntape, so that as the ice grows down, it will push water out the pipe-angle the pipe to\nW.

Used with permission.\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\n16.622 Final Report\nAbstract\nThis project sought to study the efficiency of three possible twodimensional search strategies. In the\ncontext of a broader undergoing Space Tug project sponsored by the Defense Advanced Research Projects\nAgency (DARPA), there were a number of modeling challenges that needed to be met in order to validate the\nexperimental results. Probably the most crucial problem was to reduce the complex space problem involving\nat least four degrees of freedom to a simple twodimensional model. The goal of the project was to run\ntwodimensional searches for an inert target using LEGO robots. The data collected using the robots, as\nwell as results from simulations, showed strong trends in the relationship between time and energy expanded\nduring the search sequence. The project provided a starting point for the rendezvous control system to\nbe implemented in the Space Tug by showing which of the three strategies random, semiautonomous\nand autonomous is most efficient in the twodimensional case. It was found that the semiautonomous\nalgorithm is the most energetically efficient approach, but the most timeconsuming. This finding disproved\nthe hypothesis which stated that the semiautonomous strategy is the most efficient in terms for both time\nand energy. Instead, the conclusion is that an autonomous algorithm is more suitable for space applications.\nThe results also suggest that, depending on knowledge of the search space and the mission requirements, a\nhybrid approach might be more efficient. With knowledge of orbital dynamics, the meaning of these results\ncan be extended to the space problem.\nGergana Bounova\n05/13/03\nTimoth ee de Mierry\np.1\n\nMassachusetts Institute of

has been an increasing need to service vehicles in space. Satellites and\nentire missions have been lost due to misalignments, wrong placements in orbit and software errors. These\nproblems have triggered efforts to design a new type of vehicle called the Space Tug, or the Orbital Express.\nThe Space Tug is a satellite that carries out rendezvous and docking with a target satellite. Its functions\nare to capture targets, change their position and orbital elements by a preset amount and release them at\ndestination safely. The Space Tug has to be capable of orbital debris removal, satellite rescue missions and\ntactical operations.\nFigure 1: The Space Tug moving a broken satellite\nThe Space Tug project is an ongoing MIT/DARPA research project that aims to develop a satellite\nthe Tug to carry out rendezvous and docking with a target satellite. The mission of the Space Tug will\nbe to capture its target, change its position and orbital elements by a predefined amount, and release it\nwithout damage to the target satellite or itself. The capabilities of the tug must include the following:\nrescue satellites from unusable orbits, orbital debris removal, tactical operations, and other emergent uses.\nThe control system of the tug used to find and dock with the target is a major aspect of this project. The\nsearch for the target satellite is a complex procedure. Although approximate coordinates for its location\nwould be provided, the tug would still have to search a finite space to find it, since current tracking does\nnot give precision below a magnitude of the order of one hundred meters. As a result, the Space Tug has to\nhave intelligent identification and sensing strategies implemented in its control system to approach the target.\nA major technology risk in the Space Tug project is the target identification and docking. Showing that\nsuch a process is feasible would reduce this risk and would provide a possible solution to the problem. In\naddition, given that the control system of the Space Tug has thus far been modeled as a black box, the\nresults of this research project could give clues as to what the architecture of the control system of the vehi\ncle should be. Furthermore, successful search and rendezvous strategies could be used in other aeronautical\napplications, such as autonomous and formation flight.\nSearch strategies and algorithms for robots have been studied extensively in the past years. As a result,\nthe design part of this project was influenced by previous work done on search algorithms, notably by the\nMIT Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. The basic strategies were enhanced to\nfit the purpose of the Space Tug. Time and energy consumption, as well as the successful implementations\nof three searching strategies, are the focus of the research project. It provides a first look at the most\neffective rendezvous strategy that could potentially be used in the Space Tug project. Spanning the space of\npossible search algorithms, three strategies were tested: (1) random sensorless search, (2) semiautonomous\nGergana Bounova\n05/13/03\nTimoth ee de Mierry\np.4\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\n16.622 Final Report\nwith a human in the loop search and (3) fully autonomous search with sensors. Ultimately, the goal of this\nproject was to show that the semiautonomous with a human in the loop search will satisfy this important\nrequirement.\n1.2\nHypothesis\nThe use of a semiautonomous search system with a human in the loop is the algorithm that is the most\neffective for rendezvous and docking strategies in terms of time and energy consumption.\nObjectives and Success Criteria\nThe project is divided into two distinct parts that achieve two different but closely related goals. The\npreliminary objective is to develop, implement, and test three different strategies for twodimensional, non\ncooperative target search and precise docking. This goal is the first step in achieving the primary objective.\nThe primary objective of the experiment is to evaluate a cost function in order to compare these three\nstrategies based on the tradeoff costs between time and energy. The algorithms are evaluated using prede\nfined criteria, developed into the cost function, to examine the performance of each.\nSuccess for this project is a clear definition of whether or not the semiautonomous search system is the\nmost effective algorithm for rendezvous and docking strategies in terms of time and energy consumption.\nThe three different search strategies span the full space of search algorithms in an effort to provide a valid\nassessment of the hypothesis.\nPrevious Work\n3.1\nLiterature Review\nThe article entitled \"Onboard software for the Mars Pathfinder Microrover\", written by Morrison and\nNguyen 1 describes the software used to control the motion of the rover on Mars. The constraints, in terms\nof communication and energy, on the control system of the Mars rover are similar to what the tug will face\nin space. It is thus important that these constraints be taken into account when modeling the searching\nprocedure. Due to electrical and processing power limitations, the control system of the rover is unable to\ncommunicate and move at the same time. In addition, due to communication restrictions, mainly the time\nit takes to transmit information from Mars to Earth and back, the control system of the rover uses waypoint\nnavigation and autonomous collision avoidance algorithms. In the absence of any obstacles, the rover pro\nceeds directly forward to the waypoint, including stops for proximity scanning for hazard detection. During\nproximity scanning processes, the rover uses its onboard optical sensors to generate an approximate map\nof the terrain map in front of the vehicle. Based on height differences in the map, the navigation system\nanalyzes the possible locations of obstacles. Finally, an alternate working mode of the control system is the\n\"rock finding\" option, which uses the terrain map to detect a rock. The navigation system corrects the rover\nheading, centering it between the rock edges.\nThe Mars Pathfinder rover uses a collisionavoidance control system. This technique is the opposite of\nwhat has to be developed for the Space Tug. While the rover uses the terrain map to trace a route around\nobjects, the tug will have to trace a route to its target. Although this paper is not very useful in describing\nGergana Bounova\n05/13/03\nTimoth ee de Mierry\np.5\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\n16.622 Final Report\nthe actual search algorithms, it provides a background for the type of software architecture that is usually\nused in space vehicles. The same power and communication constraints apply to the tug, and therefore\nits onboard software needs to make use of the same techniques for telemetry, which are necessary for the\nsemiautonomous search. Furthermore, the proximity scanning process implemented in the Mars Pathfinder\nis similar to what needs to be developed for the fully autonomous version of the tug. Although this paper is\ngeneral and does not provide more detailed information about the core of the software, it describes a basis\nfor the architecture for the control system that will be used on the tug.\nThe second reference is a paper by Gelenbe 2 entitled \"Autonomous search for information in an un\nknown environment\", which describes different search strategies from a \"computer science\" point of view.\nThe author models the autonomous process in which an agent, a robot or a software algorithm searching\nfor information in a computer database, searches the space around its current location for information it\nwants. The search area is divided in a set of locations (x, y), defined in a Cartesian space. Associated with\neach location is a probability q(x, y) representing the likelihood of finding the information wanted at this\nlocation. Assuming the environment is static, the space can thus be described as a probability space. The\nagent, which in the context of this project is the tug, always moves in the direction where the probability\nq(x, y) is the greatest. Once the agent moves to the new location from (x0, y0) to (xnew, ynew) , the\nprobability q(xnew, ynew) of finding information at the new point is updated depending on what was found.\nThe algorithm thus continuously updates the probability space, until the agent finds the right information\nthe target for the tug. The paper further develops a more advanced model which is more applicable to\ninformation search in a computer system than to robotic search.\nThe above search algorithm, referred to as the \"Greedy Algorithm\" by Gelenbe 2, is relevant to the\nrandom search strategy that needs to be implemented in the tug simulator. The algorithm that will be used\nin the project will most likely incorporate some or all components and rules of the Greedy Algorithm. While\nthe results of the experiments are not significant for the project, the modeling process used by Gelenbe in his\nexperiment is useful in developing the model of the search space for the tug. The mathematical tools used in\nthe Greedy algorithm can be applied to the tug's random search strategy, since the underlying probabilistic\ndecisionmaking processes are similar (e.g. the agent goes to the location with the greatest probability in the\nspace). Furthermore, the same principles can be used in the fully autonomous search. The main difference\nis that the agent, which has sensors with a given range R, can now check for information in a space of radius\nR around the location (x, y). In this process, a greater number of probabilities can be updated to recal\nculate the space. In addition, the agent is also able to build a map of the environment revealing the exact\nlocation of the information with greater precision. Gelenbe 2 falls short of developing a smarter algorithm\nand explaining how the sensors would affect the efficiency of the search.\nThe third most relevant article to the project is by Hillenbrand and Hirzinger 3, and is entitled \"Proba\nbilistic search for object segmentation and recognition\". Object recognition is viewed as a two part process.\nFirstly, a sequence of hypothesis about the object its location, geometric shape, possible movement is\ngenerated, using exterior sensors. The second part of the process evaluates these hypotheses based on the\nobject model. This paper describes a new technique for object recognition in a specific scene in a probabilis\ntic framework. It also introduces a new statistical criterion the truncated object probability to produce\noptimal hypotheses about the object to be evaluated for its match to the data collected by sensors. The\nauthor further develops a mathematical model to fit the search sequence in the experiment.\nThe depth in which this article goes is most likely beyond the scope of the Space Tug project. However,\nsome of the concepts developed are useful for the autonomous search strategy to be implemented in the tug.\nBased on the data from its sensors, the tug should be able to recognize the target in a largely unknown scene.\nGergana Bounova\n05/13/03\nTimoth ee de Mierry\np.6\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\n16.622 Final Report\nThe object recognition technique developed by Hillenbrand and Hirzinger 3 is too advanced to use in an en\nvironment with one target. However, if implemented in the control system of the autonomous tug, it will\nbe an expandable algorithm that can, for example, be slightly altered to recognize multiple targets in motion.\nThe second reference related to the Mars Pathfinder mission is on crater and rock hazard modeling for\nMars landing 4 . It describes measures for safe landing on the rough and hazardous terrain of Mars. The\ninvestigation examines simple models of crater sizefrequency distribution, rock sizefrequency distribution\nand scaling relationships to determine the hazard probabilities and choose landing terrains. The approach\nto hazard modeling and navigation generated a useful idea. A search of satellite sizes and geometries was\nperformed in order to scale the search space for the experimental setup 4 . For example, a 100meter radius\nin space with a 2meter long target translates to a 5meter experimental radius with a 10centimeter robot\ntarget. This determines the grid size to search space diameter ratio which impacts the choice of search\nstrategies. Thus, the Pathfinder rockfrequency distribution model helped focus the search space domain\nwhile retaining the validity of the experiment.\nThe four analyzed references show that the field of search algorithms is heavily explored. At the same\ntime, the lack of an exact match to the problem at hand demonstrates that the Space Tug application has\nnot been modeled previously but that one can gain by utilizing technologies from other domains.\n3.2\nApplicable Theory\nThe application of this experiment depends on the extendability of the obtained results. This demands\nproper reduction of the 3dimensional space problem to the 2dimensional grid search experiment. The\nmain difference between reality and the model experiment is the number of degrees of freedom. All results\nobtained in this Space Tug experiment are valid only for target search in two dimensions. In order to make\na conclusion, it is necessary to either find a reasonable reduction of the space problem to 2D or extend\nthe meaning of the experimental results to three dimensions. In this case applicable knowledge of orbital\ndynamics makes the first approach feasible and more suitable.\nFigure 2: The Hill's Orbit\nIn particular, assuming the tug spacecraft is within a short distance of the target satellite, their relative\ndynamics can be described using Hill's frames. This means that with some approximation it can be assumed\nthat the target is in circular orbit around the tug (or vice versa).\nGergana Bounova\n05/13/03\nTimoth ee de Mierry\np.7\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\n16.622 Final Report\nFigure 2 illustrates the two spacecraft relative positions. The left drawing in the figure depicts a service\nvehicle and its target satellite orbiting the Earth assuming that their orbits are in the same plane but with\ndifferent eccentricities. The right drawing looks at the same threebody problem but from the point of view\nof the service vehicle (in black). In its reference frame, the target appears to be in elliptic (circular) orbit\naround it while performing its motion around the Earth.\nThis shows that the Hill's relative frame allows the reduction of the 3D model to two dimensions. To\nadapt the experiment to this model, the target has to be designed such that it will move in a circle at the\nedge of a circular search space, thus making the strategies implemented in 2D valid for the space problem.\nExperimental Approach\n4.1\nExperimental Overview\nThe experiment's main objective is to simulate the Space Tug 's rendezvous with its target in a simplified\ntwodimensional environment. The space in which the real Space Tug contains several degrees of freedom\nand is too complicated to reproduce in two dimensions. As a result, important modeling assumptions were\nmade. The simulation makes use of the relative positions of the Space Tug and the target. The satellites are\nin the same orbital plane relative to Earth and their orbits have the same eccentricity. Therefore, the target\nis fixed at a point in space, relative to the search space's reference frame.\nThe experiment makes use of floor space for the search area, whose dimensions represent the appropriate\nratio of search area to tug/target sizes. This ratio was calculated using the real sizes of these vehicles and\nthe space around the target created by position uncertainties. The experimental set up is shown in Figure 3.\nFigure 3: Testbed environment for Tug/Target rendezvous simulation\nGergana Bounova\n05/13/03\nTimoth ee de Mierry\np.8\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\n16.622 Final Report\nAs shown above, the Space Tug computer has to search through the space for the target, using its sensors.\nIt is understood that the sensors ranges are much smaller than the size of the search space. Furthermore, in\nthe case of the humanintheloop search strategy, a computer is used to transmit commands to the robot\nusing a serial communication system, in accordance with the sensor data that the Space Tug computer sends\nto the human. For the other two search strategies, the computer is used only to download the control system\nthat moves the robot and the decision making software that tells it where to go. The Space Tug is made\nwith LEGO Mindstorms, using an onboard computer, and the target is a 10 × 20centimeter box. While the\ntarget is noncooperative and inert, the Space Tug carries, as mentioned previously, a collection of onboard\nsensors, including long and shortrange infrared distance sensors and touch sensors. The first two collect\ndata about the position of the target, while the last one stops the vehicle from going out of the search space.\nThe independent measuring equipment shown in Figure 3 is used to record the time it takes for the\nSpace Tug to find its target and the energy consumed during the process. Using this data, the cost function\nbetween time and energy can be evaluated, and the effectiveness of each strategy can be compared in order\nto assess the hypothesis of the experiment.\n4.2\nDesign of search space\nThe size of the search space is an important aspect of the experiment setup. It has to match the relative\nsizes of the satellites in space. Furthermore, it is necessary to model the space correctly, so that the results\nfrom this experiment can be validated for the space environment. To calculate the size of the test search\nspace, some information such as global position system (GPS) accuracy, satellite sizes and sensor ranges has\nto be collected. In the US Army Corps of Engineers manual 6, GPS accuracy is reported as approximately\n100 meters. Once the target satellite has been located, the space is which the Space Tug has to search is\nthus a sphere of radius 100 meters, centered at the expected location of the target. a database of satellite\nsizes was searched and compared to the 100meter search radius 7 . It turns out that the average satellite\ngeometry is 2x2x2 meters which gives a 50:1 length scale with respect to the search space radius. The space\ntransformation process is shown in Figure 4.\nFigure 4: Search space transformation\nAs can be seen in Figure 4, the actual spherical space that the real orbital servicer will have to search\nis threedimensional. However, since the target is not stationary, four variables are needed to define its\nposition, a length, two angles and time. The space transformation involves going from four dimensions to\nonly two. As a result, the main modeling assumption that has to be made is that the Space Tug is capable\nof insertion in the same orbit as the target. The space is then modeled as a twodimensional problem such\nthat the tug and the target are in the same orbital plane with respect to Earth. From Figure 4, it can be\nGergana Bounova\n05/13/03\nTimoth ee de Mierry\np.9\n\n(a)\n(b)\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\n16.622 Final Report\nseen that, for a target of size 0.1 meters, the size ratio is maintained if the search space is of radius 5 meters.\nSince the space is designed to be a square, the sides of the search space will be 10 meters.\n4.3\nOverview of Hardware\n4.3.1\nSpace Tug Robot\nThe robot simulating the orbital servicer is made of LEGO Mindstorms parts. The onboard computer is\na handheld, batterypowered microcontroller board, called the Handy Board and developed by MIT. Shown\nin Figure 5(b), the Handy Board is based on the Motorola 68HC11 microprocessor and includes 32K of\nbatterybacked static Random Access Memory (RAM), outputs for four DC motors, inputs for a wide range\nof sensors and a 16x2 character Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) screen 8 .\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure 5: Space Tug robot (a) and onboard computer (b)\nOriginally, the experiment was designed to use the LEGO RCX 2.0 onboard computer, shown in Fig\nure 5(a). However, due to memory constraints on this computer, the onboard controller had to be changed\nto the Handy Board, in order to be able to load the search map necessary for the random and autonomous\nsearches. The functionalities of both computers are very similar, except in terms of memory and communi\ncation. As mentioned earlier, the Handy Board has more memory than the RCX and thus is able to handle\nthe search algorithms. While the RCX communicates with the command computer through an infrared\ninterface, the Handy Board uses a standard serial port. Hence, the communication problem in the semi\nautonomous search tests was solved by tethering the robot to the command computer, which also cut down\non communication lags.\nThe Handy Board runs Interactive C. The latter is a crossplatform, multitasking version of the C\nprogramming language, which is perfectly adapted to make full use of the controller's resources. A more\ndetailed description of the software can be found in the Overview of Software section.\n4.3.2\nOnBoard Sensors\nThe Space Tug simulator carries an array of sensors in order to carry out its search for the target. Added\nto the standard touch sensors, the tug possesses two infrared distance sensors with overlapping ranges, as\ncan be seen in Table 1.\nGergana Bounova\n05/13/03\nTimoth ee de Mierry\np.10\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\n16.622 Final Report\nTable 1: Operating range for Space Tug sensors\nSensor\nUpper bound [meters]\nLower bound [meters]\nResolution [meters]\nLong Range Infrared Distance\n0.20\n1.50\n0.01\nShort Range Infrared Distance\n0.04\n0.30\n0.005\nFigure 6: Sharp Infrared Distance sensor\nThe two infrared distance sensors are built by Sharp and are shown in Figure 6. Even though they are\nessentially the same sensors, their overlapping ranges provide an appropriate field of view, so that the target\ncan be detected. The longrange sensor is used in the semiautonomous and autonomous searches, but not in\nthe random search. On the other hand, the shortrange sensor is used in all three searches to detect whether\nthe target is found or not. Once a value high enough corresponding to approximately 10 centimeters is\nreturned by the shortrange sensor, the search is stopped and the target is said to be found. The Sharp\nsensors are available off the shelf and fairly reliable. They use an infrared beam, coupled with an optical\ntriangle measuring method which reduces the influence of the reading on the colors of the reflected objects\nand their reflectivity 9 .\nIn order to use these sensors with the Handy Board, the controller had to be physically modified. The\nSharp sensors do not work with the Handy Board unless the pullup resistors connected to the analog sensor\nports are taken out of the loop. Hence, the Handy Board needs to be rewired. The leads to the pullup\nresistors were cut on analog ports 5, 6 and 7, and a wire was soldered to close the loop behind these three\nports. The latter modification allows for the use of the analog ports 8 through 16. A disadvantage caused\nby these hardware modifications is that it makes the readings from the sensors less accurate. Furthermore,\nif the leads to the pullup resistors are not cut completely, current spikes in the analog port can cause flawed\nsensor readings that can be misinterpreted by the robot's control system software.\nThe third type of sensor used on the tug robot is the touch sensor. There are two touch sensors used on a\ndynamic bumper built on the vehicle. These sensors detect any pressure applied on the bumper arms. When\nno pressure is applied the sensor reading is the passive reading on the analog port (255). Once the robot\nbumps into an object, the current through the analog port changes and and the sensor reading decreases\nfrom the rest value of 255.\n4.4\nOverview of Software\nThe software for this project is developed in two steps. First, the random and autonomous strategies are\ncoded as Matlab simulations. The semiautonomous search cannot be simulated due to the involvement of\nGergana Bounova\n05/13/03\nTimoth ee de Mierry\np.11\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\n16.622 Final Report\na human operator. The purpose of this simulation at this time is to validate the soundness and logic of the\nalgorithms. Second, the algorithms are converted to the C language to be uploaded on the Handy Board\ncomputer. The compiler used is Interactive C, developed by Newton Labs, and is specially adapted to load\nprograms on the Handy Board. Interactive C compiles the C code, customized with special sensor and motor\nfunctions to use the computer's resources, and loads it onto the board. The Handy Board contains firmware,\ncalled the PCode, which then serves as an interpreter for the compiled C code.\nThe three search strategies are random sensorless search, semiautonomous with a human decision maker\nsearch and fully autonomous with sensors search. The algorithms were designed to be general enough, so\nthat they span the space of all different strategies that could be used to find the target.\n4.4.1\nRandom Search Strategy\nThe random search algorithm is inspired by the \"Greedy Algorithm\" described by Gelenbe 2 in his pa\nper on autonomous search for information. It is a probabilistic search where the agent the tug in the\nexperiment is able to learn as it moves in the space. Each displacement in the space provides infor\nmation to the robot. In other words, when the robot moves to a point and does not find the target, it\nthen knows that the target is not located at that point. Its knowledge about the search space has increased.\nThe search space is transformed into a grid that contains a certain number of locations, as shown in Figure 7.\nFigure 7: Grid for random search\nThe distance between each point has to be dependent upon the size of the Space Tug and the size of the\ntarget. An appropriate separation between two points given that the tug and target sizes are approximately\n20 centimeters would be of the order of two times the size of the objects, or 40 centimeters. The Space Tug\nat its starting location has eight possibilities for its next move. As can be seen in Figure 7, the probability\nof going to any of the eight next locations is 1/8. Once the tug has moved, the probability associated with\nthe location that the vehicle just left is set to zero. As a result, the tug has now only seven possibilities for\nits next move. The Space Tug computer thus learns about the space as it moves from point to point. The\nsearch ends when the target is found, which is detected by the shortrange infrared distance sensor due to\nits relatively short range, this infrared sensor will only detect the target once the Space Tug is close enough\nto it.\nGergana Bounova\n05/13/03\nTimoth ee de Mierry\np.12\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\n16.622 Final Report\n4.4.2\nSemiautonomous Search Strategy\nThe basic concept for the semiautonomous search is that the decisionmaker is a human controller. Using\nthe onboard sensors, the human operator moves the Space Tug to find the target. Figure 8 shows a simplified\nflowchart for the procedure to be followed during the semiautonomous search with humanintheloop. At\nany time, the tug can perform a 360degrees sweep of the surroundings using the longrange infrared distance\nsensor. If the sensor does not report any presence of an object, then the human operator has to make a\ndecision about where to move next. The operator sends a command to the tug onboard computer, which\nthen moves the vehicle to the next desired location. All sensor data at each step is sent back to the human\noperator, in order to decide the next move in the search.\nFigure 8: Flow chart for semiautonomous search\nAnother decision is made based on the new data, and so on until the target is found. In order to trans\nmit information, the tug is tethered and waits for the new command through its serial port. As a result,\nthere is a lag between the command transmission and the tug's move. Although the transmission could be\ntimeconsuming, it is a good simulation of what happens with space transmission. For instance, as Morrison\nand Nguyen 1 describe, the Mars Pathfinder also uses waypoint navigation and delayed transmission to\ncommunicate with the Earth operator.\nAn important consideration for this strategy is human bias. A human operator has to have no prior\nknowledge of the initial conditions on the search space, so that decisions will not be influenced by that\nknowledge. Therefore, the operator cannot see the experiment, but will only read sensor data on the\ncomputer. Another part of human bias is the employment of a consistent strategy by a single person. A\nvariety of people should be invited to conduct the semiautonomous search in order to ensure unbiased data.\nThese logistics require prior organization, communication with people external to the project and maybe an\nadditional expense.\n4.4.3\nAutonomous Search Strategy\nThe fully autonomous search makes use of the longrange ultrasonic sensor to find the target in the\ntest space. The autonomous strategy is based on a probabilistic model, in which the algorithm develops a\nprobability density function to describe the search area. Since the Space Tug initially has no information\nabout the location of the target, the probability density has to be uniform across the space.\nAs can be seen in Figure 9, the symmetry and the uniformity of the distribution places the center of\nGergana Bounova\n05/13/03\nTimoth ee de Mierry\np.13\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\n16.622 Final Report\nFigure 9: Autonomous search strategy\nmass labeled \"Cg0\" in the middle of the twodimensional search area. At the start of the search sequence,\nthe tug travels toward the center of mass of the probability density distribution to its first waypoint. This\nlocation has to be a point in the search space close enough to the center of mass so that the latter is in range\nof the tug's longrange infrared distance sensor. Once at its new location, the vehicle performs a 360degree\nsweep of the surroundings in an effort to locate the target. During this process, the tug learns about the\nsearch space. If the target is not found, the density of the swept area is set to zero. The probability density\nis then redistributed uniformly across the remaining space and the new center of mass is located labeled\nCg1 in Figure 9. The process just described is then repeated. Once the target is found in range of the\nlongrange infrared distance sensor, the Space Tug vehicle moves straight towards it for rendezvous.\n4.5\nTesting Method and Error Calibration\n4.5.1\nTesting Procedure\nAll of the experimental tests were run in a student residence on the MIT campus. A large dance floor\nin this residence was determined to be the most appropriate surface for the robot. It allowed for reduced\nfriction and easy setup of the search space. The search space was constructed using a standard garden hose\nto surround it. This allowed for the robot to recognize the limits with the touch sensors on the bumper\nwithout seeing the hose with the infrared sensors, thus avoiding any confusion between the limits of the\nsearch space and the target itself. Because the testing area is used by other students and groups, the search\nspace had to be dismantled after each testing period.\nBefore each test, the appropriate control system was loaded onto the Handy Board, as shown in Fig\nure 10(a). Three of these were available, corresponding to the random, semiautonomous and autonomous\nsearch algorithms. The search was then run with the appropriate target relative position. Once the target\nwas found, the Space Tug onboard computer would display the time elapsed during the search and the\nnumber of steps taken to find the target. These measurements were recorded for each run. Figure 10(b)\nshows a human operator during one of the semiautonomous search tests. As can be seen, the operator could\nnot see the search space, which is crucial to this strategy, in order to eliminate bias errors and make the\nGergana Bounova\n05/13/03\nTimoth ee de Mierry\np.14\n\n(a)\n(b)\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\n16.622 Final Report\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure 10: Loading the code onto the Space Tug robot (a) and human operator during semiautonomous\nsearch (b)\nsearch realistic.\n4.5.2\nMeasurement Systems\nThe goal of the experiment is to evaluate a cost function that relates time and energy consumption during\nthe search strategies. As such, the relevant quantities that need to be measured are the time elapsed during\nthe search and the energy consumed from the tug's batteries. The time data is taken using the Handy Board\ncomputer's internal clock. The procedure for measuring time is directly embedded in the software, in an\neffort to be as precise as possible.\nAs for the energy measurement, a minor change was made from the procedure introduced in the design\nphase. Looking at different battery energy measurement devices, it was realized that the level of precision\nthey provide is unnecessary for the purpose of this experiment. For comparison, the number of steps taken is\na simpler and easier to simulate measure. It was estimated that the difference in energy expenditure among\nstrategies is negligible as it is solely due the use of sensors. The power needed by the sensors was estimated\nas insignificant compared to the power taken by the motors. As a result, the movements of the robot in the\nsearch space were modeled as based on a standardsized step, which was constant across all searches.\n4.5.3\nSources of Error\nSources of error are associated either with measurements taken or with logical error in the coding of the\nsearch strategies. Software or logic errors in the implementation of the search strategy are systematic errors\nthat would be hard to detect. However, a thorough and detailed debugging and testing stage for each software\ncomponent eliminated these errors. Furthermore, crosschecking of the code between the experimenters re\nduced the chances of implementing a logical error in the search strategy. Efforts to eliminate these systematic\nerrors are particularly important for the implementation of the random and the autonomous search strategies.\nErrors associated with energy and time measurements are easier to ascertain. The energy measurement\nis done using the number of steps taken by the robot. Hence, it is calculated using the tug's control system\nand the measuring procedure is embedded in the software. As a result, the number of steps returned is exact.\nGergana Bounova\n05/13/03\nTimoth ee de Mierry\np.15\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\n16.622 Final Report\nOn the other hand, there exists some error to the way the number of steps relates to the actual amount of\nenergy depleted during the search. However, the size of the error is small and thus negligible for the purpose\nof this project, as stated in section 4.5.2. Time measurement is also accurate, since it uses the Space Tug\ncomputer's internal clock. The latter device measures time in seconds and is precise to approximately one\nmillisecond.\nAn important source of error arises from the semiautonomous search strategy. The human controller\ncan be subject to decisionmaking bias in choosing the Tug's next waypoint during the search. It is of\nimportance that the human operator has no knowledge of either the location of the target or the type of\nsearch being run. Such information about the situation introduces a bias in the human's interpretation\nof the data and decisionmaking process. In order to eliminate this possible error, it is necessary to use\nan outside person to control the tug. The authors have extensive knowledge of the search strategies and\nthe situation and therefore cannot be biasfree human controllers. To reduce this effect, searches were run\nwith five different human operators. The results of the experiment need to be independent from the human\noperator. It is therefore important to eliminate the human factors effect from the tests that are run for the\nsemiautonomous search. For each test run, a different decision maker was used. The best human operator\nhas minimal knowledge of the search except the rules.\n4.6\nTest Matrix\n4.6.1\nVariables and trials\nThe independent and dependant variables chosen in the design phase were kept the same for the experi\nment. The three types of strategies (random, autonomous and semiautonomous) were tested against three\nrelative target positions as described in the Background and Motivation section. Five trials were run for\neach of the 9 (3 × 3) tests. Table 2 shows the relative target positions tested versus strategies. Target at x%\nmeans that the target is placed at a distance roughly x% of the search space diameter. For example, 100%\nmeans that upon start the target is located at the opposite corner of a rectangular grid space.\n4.6.2\nModifications from design phase\nTwo major modifications to the experiment design were made due to space and time constraints. First,\nthe originally planned number of 10 trials was reduced to 5 because testing was delayed due to hardware\ndifficulties. Nevertheless, even from 5 trials, the data gathered is conclusive. A greater number of runs can\nbe included in a future more detailed experiment where it is expected that these results will be confirmed.\nThe second major modification was reduction in grid size. Instead of the planned 50 × 50 grid, the search\nspace was 25 × 25. One reason for this change that the 50 × 50 grid caused extremely timeconsuming trials.\nThus, the space available, the time limits and the reliability of the hardware induced the reduction of the\ngrid size. Comparison between simulations with both grid sizes and the experimental results suggest that\nthe qualitative results and conclusions drawn are valid for the larger scale model.\nData Analysis\n5.1\nRaw Data Analysis\nThe experimental data presented in the next section was collected and filtered on site. As a result, all\nthe data points are valid measurements. During testing, some runs were not recorded due to an error during\nGergana Bounova\n05/13/03\nTimoth ee de Mierry\np.16\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\n16.622 Final Report\nTable 2: Test matrix: Target position vs. strategy and number of trials\nPosStrategy\nRandom\nAutonomous\nSemiautonomous\nTarget at 100%\nI\nII\nIII\nTarget at 50%\nIV\nV\nVI\nTarget at 10%\nVII\nVIII\nIX\nthe search. For instance, due to the relatively low reliability of the hardware both the Handy Board and\nthe sensors inaccurate sensor readings would, on a few occasions, stop the robot even though the target\nwas not in sight. These bad runs were not recorded and the test trial was repeated. As a result, the data\npoints shown and analyzed in the next sections are only the runs during which the robot found the target\nsuccessfully and without any sensor errors.\n5.1.1\nExperimental data tables\nExperimental data is shown below. Table 3 shows the time and energy for the five trials of the random\nsearch runs and Table 4 shows the data points for the semiautonomous search. In the latter, each trial rep\nresents a different human operator. Finally, the results of the deterministic run for the autonomous search\nis shown in Table 5.\nTable 3: Random search data\n10% Relative Distance\n50% Relative Distance\n100% Relative Distance\nTrial\nTime [seconds]\nEnergy [steps]\nTime [seconds]\nEnergy [steps]\nTime [seconds]\nEnergy [steps]\n429.36\n101.56\n485.56\n12.06\n47.19\n782.17\n58.11\n275.10\n143.37\n25.98\n229.31\n373.70\n558.08\n981.20\n308.31\nGergana Bounova\n05/13/03\nTimoth ee de Mierry\np.17\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\n16.622 Final Report\nTable 4: Semiautonomous search data\n10% Relative Distance\n50% Relative Distance\n100% Relative Distance\nTrial\nTime [seconds]\nEnergy [steps]\nTime [seconds]\nEnergy [steps]\nTime [seconds]\nEnergy [steps]\n352.36\n245.84\n775.52\n70.55\n211.54\n1066.1\n49.86\n53.88\n776.79\n245.65\n150.25\n256.17\n51.13\n366.01\n323.99\nTable 5: Autonomous search data\n10% Relative Distance\n50% Relative Distance\n100% Relative Distance\nTrial\nTime [seconds]\nEnergy [steps]\nTime [seconds]\nEnergy [steps]\nTime [seconds]\nEnergy [steps]\n254.90\n33.05\n354.35\n5.1.2\nDiscussion of results and data validation\nIt is difficult to see any trends in the data in table form. The data was processed and graphed in order to\nobserve what the relationship between time and energy was for each search algorithm. Figure 11 shows all\nthe experimental data points in the timeenergy space. It is already possible to observe some linear trends,\nespecially with the measurements from the random search runs.\nFigure 11: All searches: all test runs\nAn important aspect of the results is to look at the distance factor in the data. Figures 12, 13(a) and\n(b) show the results for all strategies for the 100%, 50% and 10% relative distance test cases, respectively.\nIn Figure 12, the general trend of the tradeoff between time and energy for each strategy can be seen well.\nGergana Bounova\n05/13/03\nTimoth ee de Mierry\np.18\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\n16.622 Final Report\nFigure 12: All searches: target at 100%\nOn average, the random search algorithm is the strategy that expands the most energy, while the semi\nautonomous search algorithm is the slowest strategy. It can also be observed that the autonomous search is\nmore efficient in terms of both time and energy than the other two strategies. The same phenomenon can be\nobserved in Figure 13(a), where the autonomous search algorithm is the most efficient of all three strategies\nfor the 50% relative distance test case. The fact that the efficiency difference between the autonomous and\nsemiautonomous searches for this test case is so flagrant can be explained by the way the autonomous\nsearch works. The autonomous version of the Space Tug robot uses a probabilistic search to find its target.\nSince the search space is initially overlayed with a uniform probability distribution, the center of mass of the\ndistribution is right where the target has to be in the 50% relative distance case. The autonomous search\nalways goes to the center of mass, and hence finds the target extremely quickly in this test case.\nThe experimental results for the 10% relative distance test case show a slightly different trend. Unlike\nthe other two cases, as can be seen in Figure 13(b), the semiautonomous search is the most efficient strategy,\nwith regards to both time and energy. The autonomous search in this case does not perform as well. Again,\nas mentioned earlier, the reason for this phenomenon is the way the autonomous search was coded. The\nrobot goes very close to the center of the search space as its first move. Hence, after that first move, the\nSpace Tug finds itself further away from the target than it originally was.\nOverall, it can be seen that the random search is not efficient at all compared to the other two strategies.\nMoreover, the autonomous search seems to be most efficient in terms of time and as efficient as the semi\nautonomous strategy in terms of energy needed. Looking at only experimental data, the hypothesis is\ndisproved, as the semiautonomous search algorithm is not the most efficient strategy. The following section\nis the analysis of the simulation data collected from the MatLab simulation which allows the validation of\nthe experimental data.\nGergana Bounova\n05/13/03\nTimoth ee de Mierry\np.19\n\n(a)\n(b)\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\n16.622 Final Report\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure 13: All searches: target at 50% (a) and target at 10% (b)\n5.2\nSimulation Analysis\nThe simulation code for this experiment was developed with a twofold purpose. First, it was used as a\nway to create the logic for each algorithm and test case. This logic form was written in MatLab (because of\nthe easy graphical interface) and then translated to Interactive C to make it readable by the Handy Board\ncomputer. Second, the MatLab code was continuously used to validate the experimental results by comparing\nthe theoretical expected data with the actual numbers. Finally, key trends in the simulation were used to\nhelp draw important conclusions from the actual data.\nFrom the three strategies only the random and the autonomous were simulated due to the complexity of\nmodeling human behavior which makes the semiautonomous hard to model. For comparison, the first two\nstrategies were tested in simulation under the experimental conditions: a 25 × 25 grid with the three relative\ntarget positions for each algorithm. For example, Figure 14 shows the random data points plot versus the\nexperimental data points.\nA hundred simulation points were plotted to demonstrate the expected trend and to remove a possible\nbias due to the randomness. The experimental data does not match exactly the model, but it is scattered\naround the simulation trend. A better match can be seen at 50% and 10% target distance plotted on\nFigure 15(a) and (b). For small number of steps and short times, the experimental points correlate with the\nsimulation trend. In general, the experimental points always fall below the simulation scatter. This means\nthat for a given number of steps, the experiment took longer than expected. The reason for that is that the\nsimulation probably does not model well enough all the time delays caused by the hardware.\nThe autonomous results demonstrate a better match between theory and practice because the autonomous\nalgorithm is deterministic. This is illustrated in Figure 16 where the simulation data points match the\nexperimental very well, apart from one data point. At 10% target distance the experiment took longer and\nlarger number of steps than the model because the robot missed the target on its way to the center (center\nof probability density).\nGergana Bounova\n05/13/03\nTimoth ee de Mierry\np.20\n\n(a)\n(b)\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\n16.622 Final Report\nFigure 14: Random search: target at 100%\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure 15: Random search: target at 50% (a) and target at 10% (b)\nTo emphasize, the simulation results were not merely used for comparison and validation but also to\nidentify key trends in the data that would help the assessment of the hypothesis. One possible generalization\nof the experimental design is to randomize the target location. Comparing 100 trials with a randomly\nGergana Bounova\n05/13/03\nTimoth ee de Mierry\np.21\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\n16.622 Final Report\nFigure 16: Autonomous search: simulation versus experiment\ngenerated target location across the board produced the results in Figure 17. According to this simulation,\nthe autonomous algorithm is less time and energyconsuming for all data points.\nFigure 17: Simulation trends: random vs. autonomous\nGergana Bounova\n05/13/03\nTimoth ee de Mierry\np.22\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\n16.622 Final Report\nThe two questions arising from this result are whether the experimental data matches this behavior and\nalso, where do the semiautonomous data points fall in this pattern. A complete discussion and hypothesis\nassessment is done in the next section.\n5.3\nComparison of Simulation and Experimental Data\nAs suggested by the simulation analysis, the experimental data confirmed the overall better performance\nof the autonomous algorithm. This makes sense even without the results because of the design of each\nstrategy. The autonomous strategy uses a larger sensor range, so it covers the search space much faster. The\nautonomous robot also goes to more likely areas of the grid, as opposed to the random which can get stuck\nin lowprobability space and waste more energy.\nThe key result concerns the semiautonomous strategy. The experimental data on Figure 18 not only\nconfirms the simulations trends (Figure 17). Moreover, the semiautonomous scatter appears below the\ntrendlines of the other two algorithms. The human operator strategy turns out to be the most energy\nefficient, but also the most timeconsuming. One lesson from the trials is that human operators make good\ndecisions but take too long to decide. Since fuel and propulsion design is often a larger constraint than time\nfor space applications, the semiautonomous search seems like a good strategy. On the other hand, time can\nbe more important on a smaller scale like for eclipses in LEO and phasing with the target satellite. The\ncommunication delay also makes the autonomous algorithm look better. Finally, these arguments suggest\nthat a hybrid approach might the most efficient.\nFigure 18: All data with trendlines\nGergana Bounova\n05/13/03\nTimoth ee de Mierry\np.23\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\n16.622 Final Report\nA combined autonomous with human operator approach will depend on the background, motivation and\nknowledge of the mission. For example, a smaller search space or more information about the target coor\ndinates would favor an autonomous approach. On the other hand, a larger search with more uncertainty\nmight be accomplished better with a hybrid approach.\nIn conclusion, the hypothesis is disproved since it was established that the autonomous search performs\nbest in terms of both energy and time. A cost function with equal weight of time and energy is a linear\ny = x function which divides the Energy vs. Time plane in two. The algorithm whose trendline approaches\nbest this line (falls in the middle of all strategies) is the best suitable for an equally weighted cost function.\nWith that assumption in mind, the autonomous strategy was established as the most robust performer.\nClearly, a different cost function caused by different customer or mission requirements might incite a different\nconclusion.\n5.4\nExperiment Validation and Future Work\nThe primary goal for designing this twodimensional target search experiment was to solve a subset of\nthe general Space Tug problem. The results from this project support one of the key themes in the servicing\nvehicle concept autonomy. Depending on the mission, the tug can have different degrees of autonomy which\ncorresponds to the hybrid search concept. A higherfidelity experiment can be designed with a greater level\nof detail, mission and customer requirements to assess the same hypothesis for a larger design trade space.\nIn summary, this 16.62x project successfully models an important aspect of the general Space Tug prob\nlem by assessing uncertainty and autonomy with a simple scheme. Future work in this area might involve\nmodifications in both the model and the experiment design. There are a number of possible ways to improve\nthe experiment as designed. For example, obtaining more data might give more insight into important trends\nand possibly point towards better versions of the strategies used. Also, randomizing the target location (as\ndone in simulation) will remove some of the bias in the algorithms relative performance. Furthermore, for\nhigher precision of the data, metrology on the robot can be implemented to close the control loop and thus\napproach better the situation in space.\nThe experiment design can also be modified in a variety of ways. For instance, the Hill's frame scheme\ncan be implemented by designing a target which moves on the edge of a circular search space. Thus the\nrobot will have to find, track and phase with the target satellite, which is much closer to real scenario in\norbit. Another potential arising from the semiautonomous data is to develop a separate human factors\nexperiment which would model decisionmaking and human behavior in comparison with automated logic.\nTogether with all the above, a higherfidelity simulation will be needed to precede the spacecraft software\nand testing programs development for the real Space Tug. This would involve not only modeling the orbital\ndynamics, but also all hardware effects.\nSummary and Conclusion\nIn view of the results presented above, we conclude that this 16.62x experiment was successful. The\ngoal of implementing the designed experiment to assess the hypothesis was achieved. The theory based in\nsimulation was confirmed by the tests. As expected, the autonomous strategy outperforms the random,\nwhich is the most time and energy inefficient overall. Moreover, it was found that the semiautonomous\nalgorithm is the most energetically efficient approach, but the most timeconsuming. This finding disproved\nour hypothesis which stated that the semiautonomous strategy is the most efficient in terms for both time\nGergana Bounova\n05/13/03\nTimoth ee de Mierry\np.24\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\n16.622 Final Report\nand energy. Instead, we conclude that an autonomous algorithm is more suitable for space applications.\nThe results also suggest that, depending on knowledge of the search space and the mission requirements, a\nhybrid approach might be more efficient.\nThe successful hypothesis assessment together with our conclusions about autonomy make this experiment\nan important asset for the general Space Tug project. The analysis of the results demonstrates a lot of\npotential for a new phase of modeling and experimentation.\nGergana Bounova\n05/13/03\nTimoth ee de Mierry\np.25\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\n16.622 Final Report\nAcknowledgements\nFirst and foremost, the authors would like to thank Professor Olivier de Weck, project advisor, for his\nsupport and insights on the project.

INTRODUCTION\n1.1 Background and Motivation\nThe Space Tug project is an ongoing MIT/DARPA research project that aims at\ndeveloping a satellite - the Tug - to carry out rendezvous and docking with a target\nsatellite. The mission of the Tug will be to capture its target, change its position and\norbital elements by a predefined amount, and release it without damage to the target\nsatellite or itself. The capabilities of the Tug must include the following: rescue satellites\nfrom unusable orbits, orbital debris removal, tactical operations, and other emergent uses.\nThe control system of the Tug used to find and dock with the target is a major aspect of\nthis project.\nThe search for the target satellite is a complex procedure. Although approximate\ncoordinates for its location would be provided, the Tug would still have to search a finite\nspace to find it, since current tracking does not give precision below a magnitude of the\norder of one hundred meters. As a result, the Tug has to have intelligent identification\nand sensing strategies implemented in its control system to approach the target.\nA major technology risk in the Space Tug project is the target identification and\ndocking. Showing that such a process is feasible would reduce this risk and would\nprovide a possible solution to the problem. In addition, given that the control system of\nthe Tug has thus far been modeled as a black box, the results of this research project\ncould give clues as to what the architecture of the control system of the vehicle should be.\nFurthermore, successful search and rendezvous strategies could be used in other\naeronautical applications, such as autonomous and formation flight.\n\nSearch strategies and algorithms for robots have been studied extensively in the\npast years. As a result, the design part of this project will be influenced by previous work\ndone on search algorithms, notably by the MIT Department of Electrical Engineering and\nComputer Science. The basic strategies will be enhanced to fit the purpose of the Space\nTug.\nTime and energy consumption, as well as the successful implementations of three\nsearching strategies, will be the focus of the research project. It will provide a first look at\nthe most effective rendezvous strategy that could potentially be used in the Space Tug\nproject. Spanning the space of possible search algorithms, three strategies will be tested:\n(1) random sensor-less search, (2) semi-autonomous with a human in the loop search and\n(3) fully autonomous search with sensors. Ultimately, the goal of this project is to show\nthat the semi-autonomous with a human in the loop search will satisfy this important\nrequirement.\n1.2 Hypothesis and Success Criterion\nThe use of a semi-autonomous search system with a human in the loop is the\nalgorithm that will be the most effective for rendezvous and docking strategies in terms of\ntime and energy consumption. Success for this project is a clear definition of whether or\nnot the semi-autonomous search system is the most effective algorithm for rendezvous\nand docking strategies in terms of time and energy consumption. The three different\nsearch strategies span the full space of search algorithms in an effort to provide a valid\nassessment of the hypothesis.\n1.3 Objectives\nThe project is divided into two distinct parts that will achieve two different but\nclosely related goals. The preliminary objective is to develop, implement, and test three\n\ndifferent strategies for two-dimensional, non-cooperative target search and precise\ndocking. This goal is the first step in achieving the primary objective.\nThe primary objective of the experiment is to develop a cost function in order to\ncompare these three strategies based on the trade-off costs between time and energy. The\nalgorithms will be evaluated using predefined criteria, developed into the cost function, to\nexamine the performance of each.\n2. LITERATURE REVIEW\nThe article entitled \"On-board software for the Mars Pathfinder Microrover\",\nwritten by Morrison and Nguyen1 describes the software used to control the motion of the\nrover on Mars. The constraints, in terms of communication and energy, on the control\nsystem of the Mars rover are similar to what the Tug will face in space. It is thus\nimportant that these constraints be taken into account when modeling the searching\nprocedure. Due to electrical and processing power limitations, the control system of the\nrover is unable to communicate and move at the same time. In addition, due to\ncommunication restrictions, mainly the time it takes to transmit information from Mars to\nEarth and back, the control system of the rover uses waypoint navigation and autonomous\ncollision avoidance algorithms. In the absence of any obstacles, the rover proceeds\ndirectly forward to the waypoint, including stops for proximity scanning - for hazard\ndetection. During proximity scanning processes, the rover uses its on-board optical\nsensors to generate an approximate map of the terrain map in front of the vehicle. Based\non height differences in the map, the navigation system analyzes the possible locations of\nobstacles. Finally, an alternate working mode of the control system is the \"rock finding\"\n\noption, which uses the terrain map to detect a rock. The navigation system corrects the\nrover heading, centering it between the rock edges.\nThe Mars Pathfinder rover uses a collision-avoidance control system. This\ntechnique is the opposite of what has to be developed for the Space Tug. While the rover\nuses the terrain map to trace a route around objects, the Tug will have to trace a route to\nits target. Although this paper is not very useful in describing the actual search\nalgorithms, it provides a background for the type of software architecture that is usually\nused in space vehicles. The same power and communication constraints apply to the Tug,\nand therefore its on-board software needs to make use of the same techniques for\ntelemetry, which are necessary for the semi-autonomous search. Furthermore, the\nproximity scanning process implemented in the Mars Pathfinder is similar to what needs\nto be developed for the fully autonomous version of the Tug. Although this paper is\ngeneral and does not provide more detailed information about the core of the software, it\ndescribes a basis for the architecture for the control system that will be used on the Tug.\nThe second reference is a paper by Gelenbe2 entitled \"Autonomous search for\ninformation in an unknown environment\", which describes different search strategies\nfrom a \"computer science\" point of view. The author models the autonomous process in\nwhich an agent, a robot or a software algorithm searching for information in a computer\ndatabase, searches the space around its current location for information it wants. The\nsearch area is divided in a set of locations (x, y), defined in a Cartesian space. Associated\nwith each location is a probability q(x, y) representing the likelihood of finding the\ninformation wanted at this location. Assuming the environment is static, the space can\nthus be described as a probability space. The agent, which in the context of this project is\n\nthe Tug, always moves in the direction where the probability q(x, y) is the greatest. Once\nthe agent moves to the new location - from (x0, y0) to (xnew, ynew) -, the probability\nq(xnew, ynew) of finding information at the new point is updated depending on what was\nfound. The algorithm thus continuously updates the probability space, until the agent\nfinds the right information - the target for the Tug. The paper further develops a more\nadvanced model which is more applicable to information search in a computer system\nthan to robotic search.\nThe above search algorithm, referred to as the \"Greedy Algorithm\" by Gelenbe2,\nis relevant to the random search strategy that needs to be implemented in the Tug\nsimulator. The algorithm that will be used in the project will most likely incorporate\nsome or all components and rules of the Greedy Algorithm. While the results of the\nexperiments are not significant for the project, the modeling process used by Gelenbe in\nhis experiment will be useful in developing the model of the search space for the Tug.\nThe mathematical tools used in the Greedy algorithm will be the same as the Tug's\nrandom search strategy, since the underlying probabilistic decision-making processes are\nsimilar (e.g. the agent goes to the location with the greatest probability in the space).\nFurthermore, the same principles can be used in the fully autonomous search. The main\ndifference will be that the agent, which has sensors with a given range R, can now check\nfor information in a space of radius R around the location (x, y). In this process, a greater\nnumber of probabilities can be updated to recalculate the space. In addition, the agent is\nalso able to build a map of the environment revealing the exact location of the\ninformation with greater precision. Gelenbe2 falls short of developing a smarter algorithm\nand explaining how the sensors would affect the efficiency of the search.\n\nThe third most relevant article to the project is by Hillenbrand and Hirzinger3, and\nis entitled \"Probabilistic search for object segmentation and recognition\". Object\nrecognition is viewed as a two part process. Firstly, a sequence of hypothesis about the\nobject - its location, geometric shape, possible movement - is generated, using exterior\nsensors. The second part of the process evaluates these hypotheses based on the object\nmodel. This paper describes a new technique for object recognition in a specific scene in\na probabilistic framework. It also introduces a new statistical criterion - the truncated\nobject probability - to produce optimal hypotheses about the object to be evaluated for its\nmatch to the data collected by sensors. The author further develops a mathematical model\nto fit the search sequence in the experiment.\nThe depth in which this article goes is most likely beyond the scope of the Tug\nproject. However, some of the concepts developed are useful for the autonomous search\nstrategy to be implemented in the Tug. Based on the data from its sensors, the Tug will\nhave to be able to recognize the target in a largely unknown scene. The object recognition\ntechnique developed by Hillenbrand and Hirzinger3 is too advanced to use in an\nenvironment with one target. However, if implemented in the control system of the\nautonomous Tug, it will be provide an expandable algorithm that can, for example, be\nslightly altered to recognize multiple targets in motion.\n3. TECHNICAL APPROACH\n3.1 Overview of Experiment\nThe experiment's main objective will be to simulate the Space Tug's rendezvous\nwith its target in a simplified two-dimensional environment. The space in which the real\nTug has to operate is complicated and contains several degrees of freedom that cannot be\n\nreproduced in two dimensions. As a result, modeling assumptions will have to be made.\nThe simulation will make use of the relative positions of the Tug and the target. The\nsatellites are in the same orbital plane relative to Earth and their orbits have the same\neccentricity. Therefore, the target is fixed at a point in space, relative to the search\nspace's reference frame.\nThe experiment will make use of floor space for the search area, whose\ndimensions will represent the appropriate ratio of search area to Tug/target sizes. This\nratio will be calculated using the real sizes of these vehicles and the space around the\ntarget created by position uncertainties. The experimental set up is shown in Figure 1.\nFigure 1 - Test-bed environment for Tug/Target rendezvous simulation\nAs shown above, the Space Tug computer will have to search through the space\nfor the target, using its sensors. It is understood that the sensors' range will be much\nsmaller than the size of the search space. Furthermore, in the case of the human-in-the-\n\nloop search strategy, a computer will be used to transmit commands to the robot using an\ninfrared device, in accordance with the sensor data that the Tug computer will send to the\nhuman. For the other two search strategies, the computer will be used only to download\nthe control system that will move the robot and the decision making software that will tell\nit where to go. Both the Tug and target will be made with LEGO? Mindstorms, using an\non-board computer. While the target will be non-cooperative and inert, the Tug will\ncarry, as mentioned previously, a collection of on-board sensors, including an ultrasonic\nrange sensor, an infrared proximity sensor and a touch sensor. The first two will collect\ndata about the position of the target, while the last one will stop the Tug upon running\ninto the target.\nThe independent measuring equipment shown in Figure 1 will be used to record\nthe time it takes for the Tug to find its target and the energy consumed during the process.\nUsing this data, the cost function between time and energy will be developed, and the\neffectiveness of each strategy will be compared in order to assess the hypothesis of the\nexperiment.\n3.2 Overview of Hardware\n3.2.1 Space Tug Robot\nThe robot simulating the orbital servicer\nwill be made of Lego Mindstorms parts. The on-\nboard computer is a RCX 2.0, shown in Figure\n2. The computer has a total of six input ports.\nThree of them are used for sensors, while the\nothers are motor inputs used to control the Tug's\nFigure 1 - Base design for Space Tug robot\n\nmovements. The computer also has an integrated infrared transmitter and receiver, which\nprovides the necessary interface between the command computer and the Tug robot. The\ninfrared signals are exchanged with an infrared tower, which communicates to the\ncommand computer through a universal serial bus (USB) interface. As a source of\nenergy, the Space Tug robot makes use of six 1.5 volts rechargeable batteries (standard\nAA).\nThe RCX computer is programmed in a special language called Not Quite C\n(NQC). As its name suggests, it is similar to the C programming language but contains\ncustom functions to define and use the input ports on the computer. The NQC language\nwas developed by Baum5 using Lego's MindScriptTM and LASMTM codes via the RCX\nsoftware development kit. Programming tools and compilers for NQC are readily\navailable and fully compatible with the Space Tug simulator.\n3.2.2 On-board Sensors\nThe orbital servicer simulator will carry an array of sensors in order to carry out\nits search of the target. Added to the standard touch sensors, the Tug will possess an\nultrasonic range sensor and an infrared proximity sensor. These are shown below in\nFigure 3.\nFigure 2 - Ultrasonic range sensor (left) and infrared proximity sensor (right)\n\nThe ultrasonic range sensor uses high quality ultrasonic transducers and a built-in\ncontroller to calculate the distance to the closest object or obstruction.6 It returns a value\nbetween 0 and 100 that represents the range to the object in half inch units. Table 1 shows\nthe operating range for the ultrasonic sensor.\nTable 1 - Operating range for Tug sensors\nSensor\nUpper bound\n[meters]\nLower Bound\n[meters]\nResolution\n[meters]\nUltrasonic\n1.4\n0.15\n0.01\nInfrared proximity\n0.20\n0.01\n0.006\nAs can be seen in Table 1, the infrared proximity sensor has a much shorter range\nthan the ultrasonic sensor, although the two ranges overlap. It is a highly sensitive sensor\nthat uses short pulses of bright infrared light. The sensor measures the amount of infrared\nlight reflected from a surface and returns values from 0 to 100, where zero represents no\nreflection detected. By using infrared pulses instead of visible light, the effect of shadows\nand room lighting are eliminated, thus providing more accurate readings.6\nThe third type of sensors used on the Tug robot is the touch sensor. There are two\ntouch sensors used on a dynamic bumper built on the vehicle. These sensors detect any\npressure applied on the bumper arms and return a Boolean (true or false) value to the\ncomputer.\n4. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN\nIn designing the experiment, the important items to be considered to make the\nproject meet the success criterion are: (1) the size of the search space, (2) the search\nstrategies to be used and (3) the measurement systems. Further concerns are related to\n\nsafety and the use of human subjects. However, this experiment will not make use of\ndangerous equipment for which special safety precautions have to be taken. Although a\nhuman subject will be used for the semi-autonomous strategy, the role of the human will\nbe solely interpretation of the sensor data and communication with the robot. The\nexperiment thus does not need specific safety guidelines to be performed.\n4.1 Design of the search space\n\nThe size of the search space is an important aspect of the experiment setup. It\nneeds to relate to the relative sizes of the satellites in space. Furthermore, it is necessary\nto model the space correctly, so that the results from this experiment can be validated for\nthe space environment. To calculate the size of the test search space, some information\nsuch as global position system (GPS) accuracy, satellite sizes and sensor ranges has to be\ncollected. In the US Army Corps of Engineers manual 4, GPS accuracy is reported as\napproximately one hundred meters. Once the target satellite has been located, the space is\nwhich the Space Tug has to search is thus a sphere of radius one hundred meters,\ncentered at the expected location of the target. Therefore, for a target satellite of size two\nmeters, the linear size ratio of search space to target size is estimated to be fifty to one.\nThe space transformation process is shown in figure 4.\n10 m\nSize ratio = 50:1\n100 m\nTarget size = 2 m\nTarget size = 0.1 m\nFigure 3 - Search space transformation\nAs can be seen above in Figure 4, the actual sphere space that the real orbital\nservicer will have to search is three-dimensional. However, since the target is not\nstationary, four variables are needed to define its position, a length, two angles and time.\nThe space transformation involves going from four dimensions to only two. As a result,\nthe main modeling assumption that has to be made is that the Tug is capable of putting\n\nitself in the same orbit as the target. The space is then modeled as a two-dimensional\nproblem such that the Tug and the target are in the same orbital plane with respect to\nEarth. From Figure 4, it can be seen that, for a target of size 0.1 meters, the size ratio is\nmaintained if the search space is of radius 5 meters. Since the space is designed to be a\nsquare, the sides of the search space will be 10 meters.\n4.2 Search Strategies\nThe three search strategies are random sensor-less search, semi-autonomous with\na human decision maker search and fully autonomous with sensors search. The\nalgorithms need to be designed so that they span the space of all different strategies that\ncould be used to find the target.\n4.2.1 Random Search Strategy\nThe random search algorithm that will be implemented in the Space Tug robot is\ninspired by the \"Greedy Algorithm\" described by Gelenbe2 in his paper on the\nautonomous search for information. It is a probabilistic search where the agent - the Tug\nin the experiment - is able to learn as it moves in the space. Each displacement in the\nspace provides information to the robot. In other words, when the robot moves to a point\nand does not find the target, it then knows that the target is not located at that point. Its\nknowledge about the search space has\nincreased.\nThe search space is transformed\ninto a grid that contains a certain number\nof locations, as shown in Figure 5. The\ndistance between each point has to be\nFigure 3 - Grid for random search\n\ndependent upon the size of the Tug and the size of the target. An appropriate separation\nbetween two point given that the Tug and target sizes are approximately 20 centimeters\nwould be of the order of two times the size of the objects, or 40 centimeters. The Tug at\nits starting location has eight possibilities for its next move. As can be seen in Figure 5,\nthe probability of going to any of the eight next locations is 1/8. Once the Tug has\nmoved, the probability associated with the location that the vehicle just left is set to zero.\nAs a result, the Tug has now only seven possibilities for its next move. The Tug computer\nthus learns about the space as it moves from point to point. The search ends when the\ntarget is found, which is detected by both the touch sensors and the infrared proximity\nsensor - due to its extremely short range, the infrared sensor will only detect the target\nonce the Tug is close to it.\n4.2.2 Semi-autonomous Search Strategy\n\nThe basic concept for the semi-autonomous search will be that the decision-maker\nis a human controller. Using the on-board sensors, the human operator will move the Tug\nto find the target. Figure 5 shows a simplified flowchart\nfor the procedure to be followed during the semi\nautonomous search with human-in-the-loop. At the\nstarting point, the Tug performs a 360-degrees sweep of\nthe\nsurroundings\nusing\nthe\nlonger-range\nultrasonic\nsensor. If the sensor does not report any presence of an\nobject, then the human operator has to make a decision\nabout where to move next. The operator sends a\ncommand to the Tug on-board computer, which then\nMove the robot\nSensor sweep\nGo to target\nCan see\ntarget?\nN\nY\nFigure 4 - Flow chart for semi\nautonomous search\nmoves the vehicle to the next desired location. The sensor\nsweep is repeated, and the sensor data reported back to the human controller. Another\ndecision is made based on the new data, and so on until the target is found. In order to\ntransmit information, the Tug will have to align itself with command computer's infrared\ntower. As a result, there will be a lag between the command transmission and the Tug's\nmove. Although the transmission will be time-consuming, it will be a good simulation of\nwhat happens with space transmission. For instance, as Morrison and Nguyen1 describe,\nthe Mars Pathfinder also uses waypoint navigation and delayed transmission to\ncommunicate with the Earth operator.\n4.2.3 Autonomous Search Strategy\nThe fully autonomous search will make use of the long range ultrasonic sensor to\nfind the target in the test space. The autonomous strategy will be based on a probabilistic\n\nmodel, in which the algorithm will develop a probability density function to describe the\nsearch area. Since the Tug initially will have no information about the location of the\ntarget, the probability density will be uniform across the space. As can be seen in Figure\n7, the symmetry and the uniformity of the distribution places the center of mass - labeled\n\"Cg0\" - in the middle of the two-dimensional search area.\nAt the start of the search sequence,\nthe Tug will travel toward the center of\nmass of the probability density distribution\nto its first waypoint. This location has to\nbe a point in the search space close enough\nto the center of mass so that the latter is in\nrange of the Tug's ultrasonic sensor. Once\nat its new location, the vehicle will\nperform a 360-degree sweep of the\nFigure 4 - Autonomous search strategy\nsurroundings in an effort to locate the target. During this process, the Tug will learn about\nthe search space. If the target is not found, the density of the swept area is set to zero. The\nprobability density is then redistributed uniformly across the remaining space and the\nnew center of mass is located - labeled Cg1 in Figure 7. The process just described is\nthen repeated. Once the target is found in range of the ultrasonic sensor, the Tug vehicle\nwill move straight toward the target for rendezvous.\n4.3 Measurement Systems\nThe goal of the experiment is to develop a cost function that relates time and\nenergy consumption during the search strategies. As such, the relevant quantities that\n\nneed to be measured are the time elapsed during the search and the energy consumed\nfrom the Tug's batteries. The time data will be taken using the RCX computer's internal\nclock. The procedure for measuring it will be directly embedded in the software, in an\neffort to be as precise as possible. The energy consumed will be measured using a Texas\nInstruments gas gauge. The device has to be mounted in the power system of the\ncomputer to measure the starting and ending level of energy in the batteries. From this\ndata, it is then possible to calculate the energy depleted during the search.\n4.4 Sources of Error\nSources of error are associated either with measurements taken or with logical\nerror in the coding of the search strategies. Software or logic errors in the implementation\nof the search strategy are systematic errors that would be hard to detect. However, a\nthorough and detailed debugging and testing stage for each software component will\neliminate\nthese\nerrors.\nFurthermore,\ncross-checking\nof\nthe\ncode\nbetween\nthe\nexperimenters will reduce the chances of implementing a logical error in the search\nstrategy. Efforts to eliminate these systematic errors will be particularly important for the\nimplementation of the random and the autonomous search strategies.\nErrors associated with energy and time measurements are easier to ascertain. The\nerror in the reading of the energy level of the batteries is between ± 50 and ± 150 micro\nvolts (μV), according to the specifications of the device from Texas Instruments.7 On the\nother hand, time measurements are very accurate, since it uses the Tug computer's\ninternal clock. The latter device measures time in milliseconds and thus is precise to\napproximately five hundred microseconds.\n\nAn important source of error arises from the semi-autonomous search strategy.\nThe human controller can be subject to decision-making bias in choosing the Tug's next\nwaypoint during the search. It is of importance that the human operator has no knowledge\nof either the location of the target or the type of search being run. Such information about\nthe situation will introduce a bias in the human's interpretation of the data and decision-\nmaking process. In order to eliminate this possible error, it could be necessary to use an\noutside person to control the Tug. The author and his partner have extensive knowledge\nof the search strategies and the situation and therefore would not be bias-free human\ncontroller. To reduce this effect, searches will be run with as many different human\noperators as possible. The results of the experiment need to be independent from the\nhuman operator. It is therefore important to eliminate the human factors effect from the\ntests that will be run for the semi-autonomous search. For each test run, a different\ndecision maker will be used. The human operator will have minimal knowledge about the\nsituation.\n5. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE\n5.1 Test Matrix\nThe main variables in the experiment will be the relative position of the target as\nseen by the Space Tug robot, the time it takes for the Tug to find the target - which will\noccur when the Tug runs into the inert target - and the energy consumed in the process.\nMoreover, another variable will be the type of the search strategy used in the trial. As a\nresult, the experiment will have two independent variables - the search strategy used and\nthe relative position of the target - and two dependent variables - time and energy\nconsumed.\n\nThe two independent variables are the only parameters that can be changed during\nthe experiment. They will affect the time and the energy consumption but will provide\nthe necessary data to assess the hypothesis. The search strategy used can only have three\ndifferent values: random sensor-less search, semi-autonomous search with human-in-the-\nloop sensor interpretation, and autonomous sensor-driven search. The relative position of\nthe target as seen by the Tug will also affect the data. For instance, if the distance\nbetween the target and the Tug is very large, then the random search could be as efficient\nas the semi-autonomous or fully autonomous strategies. As a result, a wide range of\nrelative positions of the target needs to be tested in order to increase the validity of the\ncost function. The independent variables are shown in the two-dimensional test matrix in\nTable 2. There will be nine tests in the whole experiment, and for each, the time and the\nenergy consumption will be recorded.\nTable 2 - Two dimensional test matrix\nThe above test matrix does not show the number of trials that will be done for\neach test. To reduce the error in the results and increase the validity of the results, the\n\nnumber of trials needs to be determined using estimation theory. The distribution of the\nresults is assumed to be a normal distribution, and thus the sample size, n, is defined by\nHogg and Tanis8 to be\n/\nε\nσ\nαz\nn =\n,\n\n(1)\nWhere σ is the sample's standard deviation, ε is the desired error and 100(1 - α)% is the\nconfidence interval. Therefore, to determine the needed sample size, it is necessary to\nknow the sample standard deviation. The latter can be calculated upon completing the\nfirst trials in the experiment. It is expected that the number of trials for each run will be\nno larger than ten for an eighty percent confidence interval. Using the number of trials, n,\nit is possible to construct a three-dimensional test matrix, as shown in Table 3.\nTable 1 - Three dimensional test matrix\n\nVII\nVII\nIX\nIV\nV\nVI\nI\nII\nIII\nDistance to target\nSearch strategy\nn\n\nThe above test matrix shows the three dimensions of the experiment: the two\nindependent variables and the number of trials. Each box will contain a measurement of\ntime and one of energy. Other parameters in the code, such as in the software, will not be\nvaried between runs and therefore do not need to appear in the test matrix.\n1.1 Data Analysis\nData analysis will consist of processing the raw data and plotting the points in a\ntime-energy space. The data analysis process is shown in Figure 8. From the test matrix,\nthe data will be collecting in a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet in order to be able to produce\nthe time-energy plots efficiently.\n\nII\nII\nI\nV\nI\nV\nV\nV\nI\nReceive and process data\nPLOTS\nTest data\nFigure 1 - Data processing chain\nFrom the collected data, a cost function in terms of time and energy will be\ndeveloped to describe the search strategies. This function will illustrate the trade-offs that\nexist between time and energy and could have the following form:\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n[\n]\nm\nn\nE\nt\nE\nt\nC\n×\n-\n+\n×\n=\nλ\nλ\n,\n,\n\n(2)\nWhere t and E are the time elapsed and the energy consumed during the search,\nrespectively. In equation (2), the constant λ as well as the exponents n and m are\nexperimentally determined based on the trade-off between time and energy consumption.\n\nThe search strategy that minimizes the cost function - the value of C(t, E) - will be\ndefined to be the most efficient algorithm for rendezvous and docking strategies.\n6. PLANNING\n6.1 16.622 Schedule\nThe 16.622 project is limited to one academic term and therefore needs\nappropriate planning. Particular care should be taken to assure that data can be acquired\nin the time allotted for the course during the semester. The scope of the project has to be\nlimited in order to collect the necessary data to achieve the objectives and to fulfill the\nsuccess criterion. Table 4 shows the 15-week schedule for the spring semester.\nTable 4 - 16.622 schedule\nTask\nStart\nEnd\nFeb-03\nMar-03\nApr-03\nMay-03\n3-Feb 10-Feb 17-Feb 24-Feb\n3-Mar 10-Mar 17-Mar 24-Mar 31-Mar\n7-Apr 14-Apr 21-Apr 28-Apr\n5-May 12-May\nBuilding Tug and target\n2/3/03 2/14/03\nCoding\n2/3/03\n3/7/03\nRandom algorithm\n2/3/03 2/11/03\nemi-autonomous algorithm 2/11/03 2/19/03\nAutonomous algorithm 2/20/03 2/28/03\nDebugging and testing 2/10/03\n3/7/03\nProgress review 1\n2/11/03 2/11/03\nExperiment\n2/24/03 4/18/03\nRandom search 2/24/03 3/13/03\nSemi-autonomous search 3/14/03\n4/3/03\nAutonomous search\n4/4/03 4/18/03\nOral progress report\n3/4/03\n3/4/03\nProgress review 2\n4/1/03\n4/1/03\nAnalysis & presentation\n4/18/03 5/13/03\nData analysis 4/16/03 4/30/03\nWritten report 4/30/03 5/13/03\nFinal oral report\n5/1/03\n5/1/03\nLast day to take data\n4/18/03 4/18/03\nThe first two weeks of 16.622 will be devoted to two different tasks, building the\nTug and the target and coding. However, the latter task will continue for an additional\nthree weeks beyond the first two. The coding period includes debugging and testing and\nshould require less than the five week periods allocated for it, assuming the software\nimplementation runs smoothly.\nFollowing the initial coding period, a total of eight weeks will be dedicated to\nrunning the experiment. It is expected that the random search tests can begin before the\n\nend of the coding period. There will be an overlap in the schedule. Although the current\ndata acquisition plan will be completed at the end of the allowed data collection period,\nthe eight-week estimate is conservative. All of the test runs should be completed in about\nsix hours, which corresponds to five weeks in the 16.622 twelve-hour week. Therefore,\nthis plan leaves a three-week opening with which the schedule can be adjusted to start the\ndata analysis period earlier. Finally, the five weeks of the semester will be allocated to\ndata analysis and final deliverables. During this period, data analysis will take place in\nthe first two weeks before starting the final written report.\nTwo progress review team meetings fall during the 16.622 schedule. The first one\nwill happen at the beginning of the coding period, and the second progress review falls\ntoward the end of the data acquisition period. Moreover, the oral progress report is\nschedule to be at the beginning of the data collection period.\n6.2 Required facilities and materials\nResources required to complete the experiment include the hardware - the RCX\ncomputer, the Lego parts and the sensors - which has been purchased, as well as the\nbuilding material for the test area and the target. The search area will be delimited by a\nstandard garden hose, which will be readily available from the Home Depot.\nFurthermore, the target will be made out of a metal can, which can be found quite easily.\nThe gas gauge from Texas Instruments needs to be purchased before the end of the\n16.621 term, in order to be able to start the data acquisition period on time. All other\nmaterials, such as the batteries, are readily available from the MIT Aero/Astro laboratory\nor from local stores.\n\nThe experiment is designed so that it can be setup anywhere and will not required\na permanent space dedicated for the sole purpose of this project. Instead, it is planned\nthat, for each testing session, the search space will be setup in a large enough area. Such\nfacilities include the Johnson Athletic center or the Hangar space in the Gelb Laboratory.\n6.3 Budget\nThe budget for this project is restricted in terms of non-hardware resources, such\nas consulting time with the 16.622 technical staff and the use of specialized facilities,\nsuch as the wind tunnel. The costs come entirely from the purchase of the hardware from\nLego and HiTechnic, which are the suppliers for the RCX computer and the additional\nsensors, respectively. The detailed budget is shown in Table 5.\nTable 5 - Budget\nItem\nAcquire from\nCost\nLego Mindstorms Computer and parts\nLego\n$ 200\nUltrasonic Range sensor\nHiTechnic\n$ 80\nInfrared proximity sensor\nHiTechnic\n$ 40\nTouch sensor multiplexor\nHiTechnic\n$ 19\nBattery gas gauge\nTexas Instruments\n$ 5\nSearch space building materials\nHome Depot\n$ 50\nRechargeable batteries\nRadioshack\n$ 100\nTotal\n$ 494\nAs can be seen above, the total expected cost of the project comes out to be $ 494.\nHowever, this is an estimate, and it is expected that the search building materials and the\n\nbatteries will cost less than accounted for in Table 5. As mentioned previously, most of\nthe hardware has already been purchased, except for the gas gauge and the building\nmaterials.\n7. CONCLUSIONS\nAlthough hazard avoidance has been extensively studied in the field of electrical\nengineering and computer science, the use of search and rendezvous strategies applied to\naeronautics and astronautics becomes important at a time when pilots and human\noperators are slowly being replaced by control systems that have the ability to learn and\nmake decisions based on their sensing abilities. The project described above will attempt\nto show that human decision making is still necessary when cost reduction is needed, as\nis the case in most space programs. Furthermore, the experiment will narrow down the\ndifferent possibilities for the design of the MIT/DARPA Space Tug.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nFirst and foremost, the author would like thank his partner, Gergana Bounova, for\nher help and her cooperation in the design of the project.

This project aims to identify whether an\nexpanding foam product can be implemented as a low-cost impact attenuation device that,\nunlike paper honeycomb, will occupy a minimal volume onboard a small aircraft.\nExpanding foam could broaden the applications of small aircraft for remote and quick\npayload transport, without a dramatic rise in cost as compared to other complex attenuation\ndevices such as airbags or retraction mechanisms.\n\nDuring the fall term of 2003 a series of tests will be performed to compare\nexpanding foam to paper honeycomb. The impact attenuation materials will be compared\nin terms of their impact attenuation efficiency, the pre-deployment volume they would\noccupy in a payload compartment and the reliability of the deployment mechanism.\nA drop test rig will be built at the strong wall in the MIT Department of Aeronautics\nand Astronautics during the first three weeks of the MIT fall term. Some tests will be\nperformed at this test rig while others will be performed at an Instron force press at the MIT\nTechnology Laboratories for Advanced Composites. Testing is expected to be completed\nwithin the first seven weeks of the term.\n\nThe eighth and ninth weeks of the term will be spent designing an implementation\nof Instapak Quick expanding foam to an UAV application. However, if time and resources\nare limited and the design is not completed, the functional requirements for such a design\nwill be determined. This should motivate further research to complete a design and build a\nprototype in the future.\n\nThe estimated budget for the completion of the project is $560.oo. This amount will\nbe spent in the purchase of some parts and instrumentation that have not been found at the\nMIT Gelb Lab; plus the purchase of the Instapak Quick foam that will be tested, together\nwith the heater that is used to expand the foam.\n\n1.\nIntroduction\nOne of the applications of Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAVs) under current research\nis the transport of payloads to be delivered by small parafoils. Parafoils have typical\nvertical impact velocities of about 15ft/s, but the payloads delivered usually consist of\nelectronic equipment or are otherwise delicate and require the additional protection of\nimpact attenuation at touchdown.\nPrevious research on the field concentrates on reliable airbags or retraction\nmechanisms. These devices, however, are expensive relative to the budgets for small\npayload deliveries. On the other hand, inexpensive impact shock attenuation materials,\nsuch as paper honeycomb or crushable foam take up too much volume onboard UAVs.\nVolume is a predominant concern when dealing with UAVs, which are generally small\naircraft and therefore have limitations in terms of payload volume capacity.\nThe trade-off between cost or reliability on the one hand and volume occupied\nonboard on the other suggests the opportunity for a new impact attenuation concept for\npayload deliveries from UAVs. The following document proposes a series of tests to assess\nwhether expanding foam could provide impact attenuation at a reasonable cost and, before\nbeing deployed, take up a minimal volume onboard the UAV. Expanding foam is\ncommonly used for packing shipping containers, for example the company SealedAir has\ndeveloped a product called Instapak, shown in Figure 1.\n\n2.\nObjectives\n2.1\nHypothesis\nOur primary hypothesis is that an expanding foam impact attenuation device (EFIA)\nwill occupy at least 75% less pre-deployment volume than paper honeycomb with a crush\nthickness efficiency loss of no more than 30%. Our secondary hypothesis is that other\n\ntradeoffs will not exceed an increase in cost of 50% and a decrease in reliability of no more\nthan 10%.\n2.2 Objective\nAssess the ability of an EFIA to protect a payload having a 50g-impact shock limit\nfrom a 15 ft/s vertical descent rate. This assessment will be done by comparing the pre-\ndeployment volume, crush efficiency, cost and reliability of the EFIA device against paper\nhoneycomb.\n2.3\nSuccess Criteria\n\nEvaluation of the aforementioned metrics for an EFIA and for paper honeycomb to\nan accuracy such that the hypotheses can be assessed.\n2.4\nExperiment Overview\n\nAn expanding foam product will be adapted as an EFIA, and then a series of tests\nwill be performed to evaluate the metrics mentioned in the hypotheses for both the EFIA\nand the paper honeycomb. These tests will include force press tests to measure crush\nthickness efficiencies, drop tests to evaluate the impact on the payload and deployments of\nthe EFIA device to evaluate the reliability of the mechanism.\n3.\nLiterature Review\n\nIn order to assess expanding foam as a potential impact attenuation material, it is\ncrucial to specify the type of foam that will better serve this purpose and to validate the\ntests included in this proposal.\n\nThe discussion of cellular plastics on the Handbook of Industrial Materials identifies\nthe ideal foams for shock mitigation1. Low density, rigid foams crush and therefore\ndissipate a considerable amount of energy from an impact shock. Semi-rigid foams, on the\nother hand, absorb more energy that is then transferred (to the payload) through rebound.\nSince semi-rigid foams recover after impact, they are in fact widely used for shock\nmitigation, for instance in automotive applications. However, impact attenuation for\nparafoil payloads requires only one performance which, furthermore, should be as effective\nas possible.\n\nThis reference is also useful insofar as it cites specific low-density rigid foam\nproducts and applications. This will be of great value in the market search for a product that\ncan be adapted as an impact attenuation device. Low-density rigid foams include rigid\n\npolyurethane, polystyrene, polyisocyanurate and phenolic. These are used for packaging of\nheavy industrial components and more widely for thermal insulation, for example in the\ncasing of cold boxes. The book also mentions the use of expandable polystyrene (EPS),\nwhich most closely resembles the type of expanding foam impact attenuation material that\ncould be used for this experiment.\n\nThe section on instrumented impact tests on The Handbook of Plastics Test\nMethods provides a high level background that aids the experimental design for this\nproject2. Firstly, it points out the wide and valid practice of drop tests to evaluate variables\nrelevant to impact shock. Secondly, it reviews the typical instrumentation necessary to\nmeasure these variables. Thus it mentions that accelerometers are easy to implement in\ndrop test configurations to evaluate impact shock. Accelerometer data is directly\ntransmitted to a computer that stores it for later analysis. The rest of the instrumentation\nmentioned in this reference is not within the scope of this project. Strain gauges, for\ninstance, will yield a measurement that is directly related to a potential form of energy in an\nimpacted material. As discussed above, this experiment is mostly concerned with materials\nthat dissipate rather than absorb impact energy.\n\nAn important consideration for the sampling of data from instruments such as\naccelerometers is also mentioned here. Given that the time lapse over which impact takes\nplace is so brief, there is the risk of damping the signal of the force-measuring device\nduring sampling. The rule cited is that data points should be gathered at a frequency of 5/tf\nwhere tf is the 'minimum time to failure that is required to be measured.' This\nconsideration has in fact been included in the error analysis section of this proposal, where\nthe critical interval is taken to be the material crush time.\n\nHaving established some guidance in terms of material selection and test methods,\nan evaluation of current technology in the field of impact attenuation is appropriate. The\nexisting literature in this field is mostly concerned with larger budget, complex impact\nattenuation devices such as airbags and retraction mechanisms. Both methods are very\neffective in terms of protecting payloads with more constraints on damage due to impact\nshock and they also serve multiple functions within the soft landing system they are part of.\nHowever, the increased budget and the bulk taken up by these devices disqualify them for\n\nuse in small UAV applications. The motivation behind this experiment lies very heavily on\nthese considerations.\n\nGardinier et al. give a valuable overview of a typical airbag impact attenuation\nsystem in the paper titled \"Design and Testing of the HOPE-X HSFD-II Landing System\"3.\nThe paper reports on a series of experimental tests and computer simulations performed to\naid in the design of the soft-landing system of an unmanned re-entry space vehicle (HOPE-\nX.) The final design was indeed successful despite some concern about the space\nallocation of the landing system within the vehicle.\nThe most straightforward difference between this type of impact attenuation and an\nEFIA is the mechanical complexity of the airbag system. The two intricate components of\nthe HOPE-X airbag system are a drogue gun deployment mechanism and the controls of the\ngas vents that monitor the pressure in the airbags. Furthermore, the airbags are part of an\neven larger, integrated system for soft landing. Some of the tests reviewed in this paper\ninvolve the evaluation of the integrated behavior of subsystems that is well beyond the\nscope of this project.\nUpon considering the differences between an airbag landing system and an EFIA, it\nis easy to understand why there exists more literature on the former. The HOPE-X airbags,\nfor instance, are multifunctional since they also serve to ensure that the payload lands in the\ncorrect orientation. These airbags also can protect payloads from impact shocks above 6g,\nthus providing much more attenuation than a simple crushable material. The complexity of\nthe system also allows for additional safety measures to monitor the performance of the\nairbags. For instance, even though the airbag is designed within a nominal constraint, a\nparticular trigger exists that liberates some of the gas in the airbags if a certain deceleration\nlevel is exceeded.\nThere are two main things in this paper that aid the motivation of this 16.62X\nproject and the validation of its experimental approach respectively. The first point is the\nemphasis made on space allocation for the landing system. The motivation for the\ndevelopment of an expandable impact attenuation device is therefore relevant to current\nconcerns in the field. The second point is that the empirical context in which tests of the\nperformance of airbags for impact attenuation take place is very similar to the one\ndiscussed in this proposal. Impact velocity is a key parameter for the tests and the\n\ndeceleration of the center of gravity of the HOPE-X vehicle is the main concern.\nFurthermore, the principal objective of the drop tests is to 'establish confidence' about the\nability of the airbag system to protect the payload from the impact shock limit for which the\nairbag was designed. The drop tests that will be performed in this 16.62X experiment will\nsimilarly allow us to determine a safety margin that the design of an EFIA will take into\naccount to ensure the impact shock limit of the payload is not exceeded.\n\nAs mentioned above, the other technology that has been pursued for the purpose of\nimpact attenuation has been retractable mechanisms. Among these, Brown, Haggard and\nBenney discuss pneumatic muscle actuators (PMA's).4 In this case, PMA's are used to\nenhance the soft landing of heavy cargo such as military vehicles.\nThe paper reviews the PMA force equation that has been developed to calculate the\ntensile force of the actuators on the payload as they retract. The validity of this equation\nwas compared to empirical results of both static tests and dynamic drop tests, and then a\nfinite element computational method was suggested as an aid in the design of PMA's for\nfuture applications. Overall the results of the tests showed only a minor shortcoming of the\nanalytical model: the PMA force equation failed to account for the fact that the retraction of\nthe actuator produces a pull downward on the parafoil besides the pull upward on the\npayload.\nFundamentally, PMA's work differently than impact attenuation devices such as\nairbags or paper honeycomb. Retraction mechanisms manage to decelerate the payload\nduring the descent in order to reduce its impact velocity while, for impact attenuation\ndevices, the impact velocity is a constraint under which the deceleration of the payload\nafter impact must be reduced. This is the most significant reason why the tests described in\nthis paper differ from the procedures to test the performance of an EFIA.\nAs is the case for airbags, retraction mechanisms have received more attention in\nterms of current research because of their multifunctional aspects. For instance, PMA's\nintroduce parafoil steering possibilities for increased accuracy of payload delivery, which\nare clearly out of the scope of this 16.62X project.\nThe uses of retraction mechanisms are ample in large and more sophisticated\nprojects. PMA's are complex mechanisms involving a pyrotechnic gas generator, braided\nfiber tubes and awkward triggering rods that impact the ground before the payload. They\n\nare also much larger devices since their utility is precisely to contract from an initial state\nand would therefore never have the functionality of an EFIA, which is to save space. The\nPMA's mentioned in this paper were as large as 1 ft in diameter and 25 ft long. Clearly, it\nwould be useful to study simple and low-cost impact attenuation mechanisms as well.\n4.\nTechnical Approach\n4.1\nExperiment Plan\nThe flowchart in Figure 2 shows the sequence of steps necessary to assess the\nprimary and secondary hypotheses discussed in section 2. The bold arrows indicate the\npath that leads to the assessment of the primary hypothesis and the thin arrows indicate the\npath that leads to the assessment of the secondary hypothesis. As seen in Figure 2, the\nsuccessful assessment of the primary hypothesis is mostly independent of the completion of\nthe secondary hypothesis. Similarly, the metrics that are relevant to the primary and\nsecondary hypotheses are indicated in the flowchart. This section describes the path of the\nprimary hypothesis first and then the path of the secondary hypothesis.\nChoice of Material and\nPayload Characteristics\nCrush Efficiency\nCushion Thickness\nDeployment Reliability\nDeployment\nMechanism\nVolume\nSafety Margin\nCost\nLEGEND\nPath to primary hypothesis\nPath to secondary hypothesis\n\nFigure 2: Experiment Plan\nThe initial step to take in order to perform this experiment will be to adapt an\nexisting expanding foam product that can be attached to a payload of standard size for\nimpact attenuation. Instapak Quick(r) is a market product used for packing applications in\nwhich foam expands into a rectangular bag, as shown in Figure 1. This will be adapted for\n\nthe purpose of this experiment. Paper honeycomb will be used as a baseline against which\nto assess the performance of expanding foam in protecting payloads delivered by small\nparafoils.\n1. Choice of Material and Payload Characteristics\nThe appropriate base area (Aimpact) and mass of the payload (mpayload) need to be\nselected simultaneously to the dynamic crush stress of the attenuation material\n(σdynamic). Note that, given the modeling assumption that the landing is a perfectly\nvertical descent, the base area of the payload will be the same area of attenuation\nmaterial that impacts the ground when the payload lands. The dynamic crush stress is a\nproperty of the attenuation material, defined as\n\nimpact\npayload\nimpact\ndynamic\nA\nGg\nm\nA\nF\n=\n=\nσ\n\n(Eq. 1)\nIn Equation 1, g stands for the acceleration due to gravity and G is the\ndeceleration or impact shock on the payload. A 50g-impact shock limit will be\nenforced, based on typical impact shock resistance values of electronic equipment.\nSince delicate electronic equipment is a common payload for small UAV's to deliver,\nthis impact shock limit is consistent with the motivation of this experiment.\nSince the impact shock limit is fixed, the three remaining variables that have to\nbe chosen are the dynamic crush stress of the material, the impact area and the mass of\nthe payload. Paper honeycomb products in the market are sold with specified dynamic\ncrush stresses. The dynamic crush stress of foam packaging products like Instapak\ncan also be easily determined. Although only a discrete set of crush stress values exists\nfor each attenuation material, both honeycomb and expanding foam products have been\nchosen that have a crush stress of 9 psi. This dynamic crush stress is a value that has\nbeen used previously for small payload protection with paper honeycomb. Christian\nAnderson advised this decision based on his experience in this field at C.S. Draper\nLaboratories.\nThe remaining parameters in Equation 1, that is the impact area and the mass of\nthe payload, can be varied as is necessary. The impact area will be 15\" x 18\" because\nthese are the dimensions of the bags into which Instapak expands and honeycomb can\neasily be cut to these dimensions. Note that this baseline impact area is consistent with\n\ntypical payloads of small UAV's, which typically are about 3cu. ft. The mass of the\npayload should therefore be 45 lb as evaluated using Equation 1.\nNote that an impact attenuation material will usually be chosen for a specific\npayload size and mass. Contrary to this and given the comparative aspect of this\nproject, impact attenuation materials with similar dynamic crush stresses were the\nlimiting factor in the calculations described above.\nThe chosen paper honeycomb and expanding foam products must be acquired\nand a nominal payload built according to the parameters described above. The crush\nthickness efficiency of both the honeycomb and the expanding foam can then be\nobtained empirically and compared.\n2. Crush Thickness Efficiency\nThe crush thickness efficiency, as defined for the purposes of this project, is\ngiven by the ratio of the crush displacement\nof a material that is crushed\ncompletely to the initial thickness of the cushion of material (\ncrush\nx\ncushion\nτ\n).\n\ncushion\ncrush\nt\nx\nτ\nη =\n\n(Eq. 2)\nNote that a material can be assumed to have crushed completely by evaluating a\nplot of the displacement of the material as it is crushed versus the compressive force\nthat is being applied. This plot resembles that which is illustrated for paper honeycomb\nin Figure 3.\ndisplacement\nCompressive\nforce\nxcrush\nΑ∗σdynamic\n\nFigure 3: Plot of displacement vs. Compressive force for paper honeycomb\n\nThe material is said to be crushed completely when a considerable force will not\ndisplace the material significantly. Once this threshold in compression has been\nreached, the crush displacement becomes virtually independent of the force applied.\nEach material will be crushed completely in a force press in order to evaluate the\nstatic crush thickness efficiency. The resultant values of crush efficiency may be\nconfirmed with dynamic drop tests, where a minimal initial thickness of material will\nprotect payloads of constant weight and base area that will be dropped from the same\nheight. If the impact is strong enough for the material to crush completely, the crush\ndisplacement will be measured and the crush efficiency confirmed.\nEven if the material has a damping effect (such that the force required to crush it\ncompletely is a function of the velocity with which the material is impacted), the results\nfor the thickness efficiency of the dynamic tests should not differ significantly from the\nresults of the static tests. This is because, as shown in Equation 2, the thickness\nefficiency is not a function of the force. There is also no reason to believe there will be\na damping effect for either material. Therefore, the dynamic tests will be performed if\nthe material can be impacted strongly enough at the test rig available.\nThe final result will be expressed as a percent difference in crush efficiency\nbetween materials as compared to the paper honeycomb crush efficiency.\n3. Cushion Thickness\nHaving evaluated the crush thickness efficiency of the materials, one can\ndetermine the cushion thickness required to prevent the payload from experiencing a\nshock above 50g. From one-dimensional kinematics and the definition of crush\nthickness efficiency in Equation 2, the following equation for the cushion thickness is\nfound:\n\nt\ncushion\ngG\nv\nη\nτ\n=\n\n(Eq. 3)\nIn Equation 3, v0 stands for the impact velocity. A test rig will be built of the\nappropriate height such that impact velocity will be 15 ft/s. A mass falling from\napproximately 3.5 ft will reach this impact velocity. Therefore, the height of the test rig\nwill exceed 3.5 ft such that the drop can be calibrated to assure a 15 ft/s impact velocity.\n\nThe nominal impact velocities of small parafoils that are currently being used for\npayload delivery motivate this impact velocity value.\nThe value of the cushion thickness that Equation 3 yields will be used in the\nsubsequent tests to determine a safety margin on the impact shock limit of the payload.\n4. Safety Margin Tests\nFor these tests, we will collect a broad sample of values of impact shock on the\npayload after a series of test drops using both materials. The impact shock G will be\nmeasured with an accelerometer on board of the payload. The cushion thickness used\nduring these test drops will be the minimum necessary according to Equation 3 such\nthat the impact shock does not exceed 50g and the safety margin ∆G will be defined as\ntwo standard deviations from the mean of the sample. The size of this sample is\nrequired to be 25 data points for each material in order to have a 95% confidence that\n95% of the true population fall below 2 standard deviations from the mean of the\nsample. This analysis was performed by Julie Arnold and Christian Anderson and is\nincluded in Appendix C.\nThe safety margin will determine a final cushion thickness\n\nt\ncushion\nfinal\nG\nG\ng\nv\nη\nτ\n)\n(\n_\n∆\n-\n=\n\n(Eq. 4)\nThis final cushion thickness will be taken into account when we compare the\npre-deployment volume taken up by the two attenuation materials.\n5. Pre-Deployment Volume\nThis is the total volume of the impact attenuation device, including all the\nmaterial needed for the effective attenuation of the nominal payload, as it will lie in the\npayload compartment of a UAV. Once again, the thickness of material considered will\nbe that which will provide the final cushion thickness that the safety margin tests yield.\nIf a deployment mechanism for the EFIA is developed, the volume taken up by any\nadditional components involved in this mechanism will be included in the\nmeasurement. The result will be expressed as a percent decrease in the pre-deployment\nvolume taken up by the expanding foam as compared to the paper honeycomb.\n\n6. Deployment Mechanism\nA mechanism should be designed to automatically deploy the expandable foam\ncushion while it is attached to the payload. This design will only be performed if there\nis enough time and resources. Otherwise, a set of functional requirements for the\ndesign of the deployment mechanism will be laid out according to the results of the rest\nof the experiment. The design criteria that will motivate these functional requirements\nwill be the secondary hypothesis stated in section 2.1.\n7. Mechanical Reliability\nThe initial assumption for this metric is that the reliability of paper honeycomb\nis 100% because honeycomb does not rely on any mechanism to be deployed. A\nnumber of Instapak bags will then be deployed, and the number of trials with successful\nfoam expansion within 2 minutes will be recorded. Note that a trial will be considered\nsuccessful only if the foam expands to the prescribed thickness and in the prescribed\ntime lapse as stated by Instapak manufacturers. The criteria for this definition of\nreliability will therefore be that the desired impact attenuation is provided and that the\nfoam in a UAV payload would expand before touchdown.\nThe mechanical reliability of the expanding foam impact attenuation device\nwill then be evaluated as the ratio of successful trials to the sample size. The result will\nbe expressed as the percent loss in the mechanical reliability of expanding foam as\ncompared to that of paper honeycomb.\n8. Cost\nThis will be expressed as the percent difference in the current market price of\nthe expanding foam as compared to that of the paper honeycomb. In each case, the cost\nconsidered will be that of the total amount of material needed to satisfy the same\nnominal requirements, plus an estimate of the cost of the deployment mechanism of the\nEFIA device if this is in fact developed. However, there are a complex set of other\nvariables that will affect the final cost of an EFIA device and that will not be included\nin this tentative comparison.\n4.2\nApparatus\nThe apparatus required to perform these tests include an Instron(r) force press (found\nat the MIT Telac laboratories) for the static crush thickness efficiency tests, and a test rig to\n\nperform drop tests for the dynamic crush thickness efficiency tests and to find the\ndistribution of impact shock on the payload, from which a safety margin is determined.\nThe instrumentation required to collect all measurements include:\n- A ruler to measure the pre-deployment volume of paper honeycomb;\n- A beaker to measure the pre-deployment volume of the EFIA device accurately;\n- An accelerometer to measure the impact shock during the safety margin tests;\n- A high speed camera to record the displacement of the crushed materials during\nthe dynamic crush thickness efficiency tests;\n- A digital timer with photo-gates to confirm the impact velocity of the payload;\n- Two computers to input the data acquired from the aforementioned\ninstrumentation; and\n- The force press, which outputs load and displacement during the static crush\nthickness efficiency tests.\nThe test rig will consist of two rails that will guide the payload in a vertical descent\nand that will be held up by two Unistrut(r) frames. These frames plus a beam holding a\npulley (from which the payload will hang) will be attached to the strong wall at the MIT\nAeronautics and Astronautics Department. The wire rope holding the payload will be\nattached to a quick-release loop and to a winch.\nThe main functions of the rails are to guide the payload in a vertical descent and to\nensure that the bottom surface of the payload lands horizontally, such that the impact\nattenuation material is crushed evenly upon impact. The pulley and the quick-release\nmechanism are necessary such that the payload can be released from a distance and the\nfalling weights do not constitute a hazard. The winch will be helpful to lift the payload\nbefore every drop during the tests. Finally, it should be noted that only the beam that holds\nthe pulley will support the weight of the payload and that it will be securely clamped to the\nstrong wall. The frames holding the rails will also be clamped to the strong wall such that\nthe rails are secured in their position.\nDetailed sketches of the test-rig configuration are included in Appendix A and\nconsiderations about the setup of the test rig are included in section 6.1.\n\n4.3\nTest Articles\nThe test articles will be:\n-\nBoth impact attenuation materials;\n-\nThe payload box, to which the impact attenuation materials will be\nattached during the drop tests; and\n-\nThe EFIA deployment mechanism that will be tested for mechanical\nreliability.\nThe impact attenuation materials will be attached to the payload with duct tape.\nAlthough this may not be ideal during the descent of the parafoil, it is the most practical\nconfiguration for performing multiple tests using the same payload. Figures 4(a) and (b)\nshow the two impact attenuation materials: paper honeycomb, produced by Pactiv(TM);\nand Instapak, the type of expanding foam that will be used for this project.\n\nThe payload will consist of a plywood box, as shown in Figure 5, with the base area\nand space to fit weights as discussed in section 4.1. The weights will be bolted down to the\npayload box to prevent any safety hazards and the effects that the rebound of the weights\nmight have on the impact shock measurements. The payload will also be adapted so that\n-\nThe payload can be attached to the linear bearings that will slide along\nthe rails of the test rig,\n-\nThe accelerometer can be mounted towards the base of the payload (in\norder to minimize vibration after impact); and\n-\nThe blinder that intercepts the photo-gates at impact can be mounted in\nthe appropriate position.\n\nHoles should be drilled on the upper edges of the payload box so that this can be tied to the\nrope wire that will feed into the pulley.\nBlinder\n0.7\"\nplywood\nAccelerometer\nWood\nreinforcements\n\nFigure 5: Payload Box Isometric View\nDetailed drawings of the payload are included in Appendix A and considerations\nabout its construction are included in section 6.2.\n\n4.4\nTest Matrices\n4.4.1 Crush Thickness Efficiency Tests\nThe parameter under which both crush thickness efficiency tests will be\nperformed is the initial thickness of the cushion, which, as described in section 4.1,\nwill be the smallest thickness possible. The dependent variable is the material since\nthe test will be performed for both honeycomb and expanding foam. The\nindependent variable of the test is the crush displacement, from which the crush\nthickness efficiency will be calculated according to Equation 2. These variables are\nshown in Table 1. Four such matrices will exist: one for each material in both the\ndynamic and the static tests.\n\nTable 1: Test Matrix for Each Material in Crush Thickness Efficiency Tests\nTrial number\nInitial Cushion\nThickness τ (in)\nCrush Displacement\nxcrush (in)\nCrush Thickness\nEfficiency ηcrush\n1-5\n\nAverage\n\n4.4.2 Safety Margin Tests\nThe parameters for the safety margin tests will be an impact velocity of 15\nft/s and the cushion thickness required of each material according to Equation 3.\nThe independent variable is once again the material, such that the test matrix shown\nin Table 2 will be used both for honeycomb tests and for EFIA material tests. The\ntest will be performed for a number of trials, and the dependent variable that will\nresult from each of these trials is the maximum impact shock G on the payload.\nThe safety margin ∆G will be twice the size of the standard deviation of the\ndistribution obtained from these trials.\n\nTable 2: Test Matrix for each Impact Attenuation Material in Safety Tests\nTrial Number\nMaximum Shock Recorded G (ft/s2)\n1-25\n\n4.4.3 Pre-Deployment Volume Measurements\nIn the pre-deployment volume measurements, the independent variable is the\nattenuation material/device and the dependent variable is the volume measured.\nThese variables are shown in Table 3.\n\nTable 3: Test Matrix for Pre-deployment Measurements\nImpact Attenuation\nPre-Deployment Volume (ft3)\nPaper Honeycomb\n\nEFIA device\n\n4.4.4 Mechanical Reliability Tests\nThe mechanical reliability will be measured only for the deployment\nmechanism of the EFIA device. The parameters that will be assessed are the final\ncushion thickness that the material is expected to expand to and the time expansion\nis expected to take. The test will be performed for a number of trials and the\ndependent variables that will result will be the cushion thickness of the expanded\nmaterial and the time for full expansion. These values will yield a yes or no answer\nto whether the expansion was as expected, from which a final value of the\nmechanical reliability will be determined as explained in section 4.1.\n\nTable 4: Test Matrix for Mechanical Reliability Tests\nTrial Number\nTime to Expand\n(seconds)\nFinal Cushion Thickness τ\n(in)\nAppropriate Deployment\n(Y/N)\n\n5.\nDiscussion of Errors\nAll uncertainties that are identified in this section are stated in Section 7.3, which\nincludes a discussion of how these uncertainties are propagated to the metrics that will be\nevaluated from direct measurements.\n5.1\nCrush Thickness Efficiency\nIn order to achieve the success criteria proposed in section 2.3, the accuracy to\nwhich values of crush thickness efficiency and pre-deployment volume are determined\nmust be known. As Equation 2 suggests, the random errors involved in evaluating the\ncrush thickness efficiency can be traced back to the errors involved in measuring and\ndetermining the initial cushion thickness and the crush displacement. The error in the\ninitial cushion thickness is the accuracy of the ruler that will be used to measure it. The\nerror in the crush displacement is slightly more complicated.\nAs discussed above, the crush displacement for a material that is crushed\ncompletely can be obtained from displacement versus compressive force plots. The end of\nthe plateau illustrated in Figure 3, which marks the crush displacement, may be hard to\ndetermine from these plots. In order to reduce this inaccuracy, the tests will be performed 5\n\ntimes for each material and the final value of crush thickness efficiency will be the average\nof the sample.\nIt should be noted that these plots will be derived from force (or deceleration) and\ndisplacement measurements at the force press or at the test rig. The force press will output\nthese values directly, while at the test rig the deceleration or impact shock will be measured\nwith the accelerometer and the crush displacement will be measured with the high speed\ncamera.\n5.2\nPre-Deployment Volume\nThe random error in the pre-deployment volume measurements is the accuracy of\nthe instruments used to measure volume, that is, the accuracy of ruler used to measure the\nvolume of the paper honeycomb and the accuracy of the beaker used to measure the volume\nof the pre-deployed expanding foam.\nHowever, the pre-deployment volume depends directly on the final cushion\nthickness, which takes into account the safety margin.\n5.3 Safety Margin Tests\nThe final cushion thickness will be evaluated using Equation 4 and will include a\nbias error due to the inaccuracy of two parameters that are experimentally determined. The\nfirst is the crush thickness efficiency, determined during the crush thickness efficiency\ntests. The second is the calibration of the test rig to enforce an impact velocity of 15ft/s.\nThis calibration is limited by the accuracy of the digital timer and the photo-gates that will\nbe used to measure impact velocity.\nThe other parameter that is experimentally determined and that will affect the final\ncushion thickness is the safety margin, ∆G. Since the safety margin tests are done\nproviding a marginal or initial cushion thickness, there will be a bias error in the\ndistribution of impact shock that is observed. This bias error will also emerge from,\nsimilarly to what is discussed above, the crush thickness efficiency and the calibration of\nthe test rig to the appropriate impact velocity.\nFinally, the random error involved in the measurement of each shock and that will\naffect the safety margin is the accuracy of the accelerometer, combined with the ability to\nrelease the payload from the same height after each test.\n\n5.4 Additional Considerations\nThere is an important measurement system implied in the recording of the highest\nimpact shock on the payload during the safety margin tests. The accelerometer will be\nanalog, but the accelerometer reading is sampled into a computer discretely, such that the\nhighest impact shock value could be lost.\nThe time lapse for the attenuation material crush can be calculated with one-\ndimensional kinematics for a deceleration from 15 to zero ft/s given an impact shock\n(deceleration) of 50g. This lapse is of the order of 0.01 s. In order to have an accurate\ncurve of the impact shock on the payload during this lapse of time, a sampling frequency of\nat least 5/0.01 s, that is, 500 Hz is required2. The data acquisition computer that will be\nused has a sampling frequency of 100 kHz and it samples data from the accelerometer\nthrough 3 different channels (corresponding to three orthogonal axes), resulting in a\nsampling rate in the vertical direction of more than 30 kHZ. This means that there is no\nconsiderable risk that the impact shock signal from the accelerometer will be damped.\nOf the uncontrolled inputs to our tests, human and machine errors are included in\nthe instrument accuracy values. Other uncontrolled inputs will be mostly ambient changes,\nin particular affecting the expansion of the EFIA material. This error will be taken into\naccount within the safety margin that will be determined.\n6. Construction Procedures\nPlease refer to Appendix A for detailed drawings of the drop test rig and the\npayload box that will be constructed. All materials and instrumentation that this section\nrefers to are listed in detail in Appendix B.\n6.1\nDrop Test Rig\n1. The Unistrut lengths that will be used to build the frames of the test rig and to hold\nthe pulley must be cut to the appropriate length at the machine shop of the MIT\nDepartment of Aeronautics and Astronautics. This includes:\n- 2 front beams that are 24.58\" long,\n- 4 side beams that are 18.65\" long, and\n- 1 cantilever beam that is 13.125\" long.\nUnistrut beams are shown in Figure 6:\n\n2. Two holes will be drilled in each of the 18.65\" long pieces of Unistrut, where\nthe shaft supports will be bolted to the frame. These holes will have a diameter\nof 0.11\" and will be located on the face of the Unistrut opposite to the channel,\ncentered along the length of the beam, 1.5\" apart and 0.85\" from the side of the\nbeam.\n3. The top and bottom Unistrut frames will be assembled with right angled fittings\nrunning along the outer side of the frame, as sketched below:\nUnistrut\nframes\nRight angle\nfittings\nBolts going through fittings and Unistrut\nspring nuts\nChanneled\nside of\nUnistrut\nSmooth side\nof Unistrut\n\nFigure 7: Top view of frame assembly\n4. The pulley will be attached 10.125\" from one end of the cantilever beam.\n5. The assembled frames will be clamped with I-beams to the strong wall, one at\nthe level of the floor and the other at a height of 6 feet. The cantilever beam\nholding the pulley will be clamped with an I-beam, 7 feet above the ground and\nbetween the sides of the upper frame.\n\n6. Two ball bearings will be inserted in each shaft and then a shaft support will be\ntightened at both ends of the shaft.\n7. The shaft supports will be bolted to the holes on the sides of the frames. The\ninterface between the Unistrut beam, the shaft support, the shaft and the ball\nbearings that will be bolted to the payload is sketched in Figure 8. Detailed\ndrawings of this interface are also included in Appendix A.\nShaft support\nTop, side Unistrut beam\nBall bearing\nShaft\n\nFigure 8: Test Rig Detail Isometric View\n6.2\nPayload Box\n1. The blinder that intercepts the photo-gates has to be milled at the machine shop.\nIt must be 4\" long and 0.120\" +/- 0.005\" wide.\n2. All sides of the payload box and the inner reinforcements have to be sawed to\nthe appropriate dimensions, as specified in Appendix A.\n3. Holes must be drilled on the faces of the payload box as follows:\n- 4 holes on each side face to attach to the ball bearings on the shafts.\n- A hole towards the top of each face from which the payload will be tied\nto the rope wire.\n- 2 holes on the front face to attach the accelerometer to the payload.\n- 5 holes on the bottom face to insert bolts that will hold the weights inside\nthe payload in place.\nThe diameters and locations of all holes are specified in Appendix A.\n\n4. The box will be held together with wood screws and reinforced with 1\" by 1\"\nwood blocks running along every inner edge. The locations of these screws are\nspecified in Appendix A.\n5. The bolts for the accelerometer and the weights will be attached in their\nappropriate location. Note that the accelerometer should be placed such that the\nconnecting wires will be plugged in at the top. This way the wires will not hit\nthe frame nor get entangled between it and the payload during the fall.\n6. The photo-gate blinder will be glued with industrial adhesive to the bottom of\nthe front face of the payload box, protruding to one side as sketched in\nAppendix A.\n7. The payload will be weighed to determine what additional load needs to be\nadded.\n6.3\nSet-up\n1. A metal L will be clamped to the side of the bottom frame in the location\nspecified in Appendix A. The photo-gate will be stuck with duct tape to this\nmetal L such that it can be relocated for different drop tests in which the\nthickness of the attenuation material will change. The height at which the\nphoto-gate must be held before each test will be such that the blinder on the\npayload lies just below the photo-gate when the payload is laid on the platform.\n2. A 2\" by 15\" by 18\" wood platform will be placed on the floor inside the bottom\nframe of the test-rig such that the impact is even.\n3. The payload box will be attached to the ball bearings on the shafts.\n4. Weights as needed will be put through the bolts on the base of the payload and\ntrying to distribute the load evenly across the area.\n5. The payload will be tied with rope wire, which will be fed through the pulley\nand connected to the quick release off the floor of the strong wall. The winch\nwill also stand at this location to pull the payload up before each drop.\n6. The high speed camera will be placed 2\" above the floor besides the test rig and\nopposite to the location of the photo-gate such that connecting wires don't\nconflict. Note that the camera will be aimed at the top of the platform where\nimpact will occur.\n\n7. A ruler will be placed vertically next to the platform and facing the high speed\ncamera.\n6.4\nSafety concerns\nDuring the construction of the test-rig and during the tests at the test-rig site and at\nTelac, a conservative attitude will be maintained. Julie Arnold has attended the machine\nshop training session and she will be in charge of milling the Unistrut beams and the photo-\ngate blinder while observing all safety procedures. Tests will be performed at the force-\npress under John Kane's guidance.\nThe test-rig has been designed such that the payload can be released from a few\nmeters apart to prevent accidents due to the falling load. Furthermore, the weights will be\nbolted down in the payload such that they don't fall off during the fall.\nBoth Julie Arnold and I will be present at all construction and data-collection\nsessions, to assist each other if necessary.\n7. Data Acquisition and Analysis\n7.1 Measurement Systems\nAt the test-rig, data will be acquired separately from the accelerometer, the high-\nspeed camera and the digital timer. The accelerometer outputs to a stand-alone analog to\ndigital board through a five pin connector. One of the pins has to be connected directly to a\n5 volt battery, another pin is grounded and other three pins output voltages corresponding\nto the induced acceleration in three axis. This A/D board inputs the data to a computer for\nlater reduction using National Instrument's LabVIEW software. This data may then be\ntransferred to Matlab in order to draw displacements versus force plots with the data\ncollected from the high-speed camera.\nThe high-speed camera is connected to a separate computer and has its own\nsoftware. The software records still frames at 8000Hz and, after it is calibrated with the\nruler seen on the image, it will read off the distance between two points where the cursor is\nset. Namely, it will provide the displacement of the crushed material.\nThe photo-gates are connected directly to a stand-alone digital timer from which the\nimpact velocity of each trial can be read off. This will be useful before the tests to calibrate\nthe height from which the payload must be released such that the impact velocity is as close\nto 15ft/s as possible.\n\nAt Telac, the force press outputs load, displacement and time directly to a computer.\nThe data can be viewed in any data analysis software.\n7.2 Data Reduction\n7.2.1 Static Crush Thickness Efficiency Tests\nTwo sets of data will be obtained from these tests: the initial thickness of\neach sample of impact attenuation material and the displacement versus\ncompressive force plots from the computer connected to the force press. Two\nresults will be derived from this data:\n- The average force values that lie on the plateau of these plots will be\naveraged. This average value can be divided by the payload base\narea to confirm the dynamic crush stress of each material, as shown\nin Figure 3.\n- For each attenuation material, the crush displacement will be\nextracted from each plot and divided by the initial cushion thickness\nto give the crush thickness efficiency of each sample. These values\nwill then be averaged for each impact attenuation material.\n7.2.2 Dynamic Crush Thickness Efficiency Tests\nThe data obtained from these tests will be the initial thickness of each\nsample, the picture frames from the high speed camera and the impact shock versus\ntime plots from the computer that is connected to the accelerometer. The crush\ndisplacement of a set of frames will be extracted using the software that\naccompanies the high-speed camera. These displacement values will be plotted\nagainst the impact shock values obtained from the accelerometer using Matlab. If a\nplateau is observed in these plots, a crush displacement value will be extracted. The\ncrush thickness efficiency of each test will then be evaluated and an average value\nwill be found for both paper honeycomb and expanding foam.\nThe data will be analyzed such that, if the impact attenuation material does\nnot crush completely, the static crush thickness efficiency will be used in\nsubsequent tests. With the chosen crush thickness efficiency value, the marginal\ncrush thickness necessary for the safety margin tests will be evaluated using\nEquation 3.\n\n7.2.3 Safety Margin Tests\nThe data obtained from these tests are the impact shock versus time plots\nfrom the computer connected to the accelerometer. The maximum impact shock\nvalue of each of these tests must be extracted and put into Matlab. From Matlab,\nthe sample distribution, its mean and the value of two standard deviations will be\nextracted.\nSubsequently, the final cushion thickness will be evaluated using Equation\n4. The final cushion thickness will be multiplied by the payload base area in order\nto find the pre-deployment volume of the paper honeycomb.\nSince the pre-deployed expanding foam comes in discrete volume\nincrements (the volume of each pre-deployed Instapak bag), the number of pre-\ndeployed bags necessary to reach or exceed the final cushion thickness will be\nevaluated.\n7.2.4 Pre-Deployment Volume of EFIA\nThe number of Instapak bags determined to satisfy the final cushion\nthickness after the safety margin tests will be submerged in a beaker. The volume\nof water displaced will be the pre-deployment volume of the EFIA.\n7.2.5 Deployment Reliability Tests\nThe data collection for this test will run parallel to all other tests: each time\nan Instapak bag is deployed, the time it takes to fully expand and the thickness of\nthe expanded cushion will be recorded. This data will be entered in Table 4 and a\ncorrect deployment will be assessed. The number of successful deployments will be\ndivided by the number of samples to obtain the reliability of the Instapak\nmechanism.\n7.2.6 Hypothesis Assessment\nThe values of crush thickness efficiency, pre-deployment volume and\ndeployment reliability of the EFIA will be expressed as a percent of the respective\nvalues of paper honeycomb. These results will be presented in bar graphs as shown\nin Figure 9.\n\nηt\nPre-\ndeployment\nvolume\nDeployment\nreliability\nPaper honeycomb\nEFIA\n%\ndifference\n0%\n100%\n\nFigure 9: Hypothesis Assessment Bar Graphs\n7.3 Error Analysis\nThe accuracies of the instrumentation used for this project are:\n- Ruler accuracy: 0.0625\"\n- Force press displacement accuracy: 0.01\"\n- High-speed camera sampling rate is 8kHz, therefore the time between\nframes is 1.25 x 10-4 seconds\n- Crossbow accelerometer series CXL100HF3\n-\nrange: -100g to 100g\n-\naccuracy due to sensitivity: 2%\n-\naccuracy in measurements around 50g: 1g\n- Photo-gate samples light at 1 MHz, therefore time measurement accuracy:\n10-6 seconds\nNote that all independent errors that affect a certain metric will be combined according to\nthe general rule for combination of errors:\n\n...\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\ndx\nx\nF\ndx\nx\nF\ndx\nx\nF\ndz\nδ\nδ\nδ\nδ\nδ\nδ\n+\n+\n=\n\n(Eq. 5)\nIn Equation 5,\n.\n...)\n,\n,\n(\nx\nx\nx\nF\nz =\n7.3.1 Crush Thickness Efficiency Measurement Errors\nStatic Tests\n\nThe measurement error in the crush thickness efficiency is due to the\naccuracy of the force press and the ruler. From Christian Anderson's experience\nwith paper honeycomb, it is known that a typical initial cushion thickness would be\n\n2\", which will crush about 1.3\". The crush thickness efficiency of paper\nhoneycomb is known to be about 63%. Based on this data the general rule for\ncombination of errors can be applied to Equation 2 as follows:\n\n)\n(\n)\n(\ncushion\ncushion\ncrush\ncrush\nt\nt\nd\nx\ndx\nτ\nτ\nη\nη\n+\n=\nd\n\n(Eq. 6)\n\nThe static crush thickness efficiency tests will therefore be accurate to 2.1%,\nwhich is acceptable to achieve the success criteria stated in section 2.3.\nDynamic Tests\n\nThe error in the measurement of crush displacement during the dynamic tests\nis affected by two sources of error, namely the sampling frequency of the high-\nspeed camera and the accuracy of the ruler that is used to scale the picture frames.\nThe error due to the sampling frequency of the camera can be conservatively\nquantified by assuming that, in a perfectly elastic collision, two consecutive frames\nare frozen 6.25 x 10-5 seconds (half the time between frames) before and after the\nmaximum displacement. Assuming an acceleration of 50g, this scenario would\nresult in an error in the crush displacement measurement of 3.78 x 10-5 inches. The\ncombined error due to the accuracy of the ruler and the sampling rate would\ntherefore be 0.063\". This result shows that the error due to the sampling of the\ncamera has a negligible effect on the combined error of the crush displacement.\nThe combined error in crush displacement can itself be combined, as was\ndone for the static tests, with the error of the initial cushion thickness measurement,\nleading to a measurement error of 3.75% in the dynamic crush thickness efficiency\nvalues.\nNote that, if dynamic crush thickness efficiency values are indeed found\nexperimentally, these -rather than those resulting from static tests- will be used to\ndetermine other parameters in subsequent tests. For this reason, the error analysis\nthat follows takes into account a possible error of 3.75% in crush thickness\nefficiency values.\n7.3.2 Pre-Deployment Volume Measurement Errors\nThe pre-deployment volume of paper honeycomb will be determined by the\naccuracy of the ruler that will be used to measure the width, depth and height of the\n\nhoneycomb sample. Assuming a base area of 15\" x 18\" and a final cushion\nthickness of 2.5\", the possible error will be 11% of the volume of the honeycomb\nsample.\nThe accuracy of the beaker that is used to measure the volume of Instapak\nbags must be such that the pre-deployment volume of expanding foam is shown to\nbe at least 86% less and at most 66% less than the volume of paper honeycomb.\nThis will allow the fulfillment of the success criteria.\n7.3.3 Final Cushion Thickness Errors\nBias Error Effects on the Maximum Impact Shock Distribution\nAs mentioned in section 5, the final cushion thickness will be affected by\nboth bias and random errors when a safety margin is determined.\nThe bias error in the distribution of maximum impact shock values will be\ndue to the inaccuracy of the specifications used to set up the tests, which are also\nexperimental results. As can be seen from Equation 3, the actual impact shock felt\nby the payload will be a function of the marginal cushion thickness, the impact\nvelocity and the crush thickness efficiency. The impact velocity will be biased\nbecause of inaccurate calibration of the test rig, whether because of the inaccuracy\nof the digital timer reading or the inability to release the payload from the precise\nheight from which it would impact at 15ft/s. The crush thickness efficiency is the\ndirect result of previous tests, as discussed in section 7.3.2. The marginal cushion\nthickness will be evaluated using that same result.\nThe accuracy of the impact velocity measurements is determined by two\ndifferent sources of error. The digital timer provides virtually instantaneous\nvelocity measurements by dividing the width of the photo-gate blinder by the time\nduring which the blinder intercepts the photo-gate light beam. The sources of error\nin this measurement are therefore the sampling rate of the photo-gate and the fact\nthat the photo-gate blinder accelerates while intercepting the light beam.\nThe error dv1 due to the sampling rate is the combined accuracy of the\ndigital timer and the accuracy\nto which the width of the blinder is milled:\nblinder\ndw\n\n)\n(\n)\n(\nsample\nsample\nblinder\nblinder\nt\ndt\ndw\ndw\nv\n+\n=\ndv\n\n(Eq. 7)\n\nThe error dv2 due to the acceleration of the blinder can be at most one half of\nthe change in velocity that the blinder undergoes while intercepting the photo-gates:\n\nblinder\ngw\n2 =\ndv\n\n(Eq. 8)\nThe combined velocity error can then be found using Equation 5, which\nyields an uncertainty of 0.743ft/s or 0.05% of an impact velocity of 15ft/s.\nSince the error in the dynamic crush thickness efficiency value is known, the\nerror in the marginal or initial cushion thickness can be evaluated using Equation 3\nas follows:\n\n)\n(\nt\nt\ncushion\nd\ngG\nv\nd\nη\nη\nτ\n=\n\n(Eq. 9)\nThe specifications to determine the initial cushion thickness will be: an\nimpact shock of 50g, an impact velocity of 15ft/s and the crush thickness efficiency\nvalue that results from dynamic tests (assumed for this calculation to be 63%). The\nresulting uncertainty in the marginal cushion thickness evaluation is thus 0.234\".\nAll the errors mentioned above can be assumed random and independent.\nThe combined bias error that will shift the mean of the maximum impact shock\ndistribution can thus be calculated using Equation 5, which yields a possible shift of\n10.9g's from the true mean.\nRandom Error Effects on the Maximum Impact Shock Distribution\nThe two random error effects on the impact shock are due to the accuracy of\nthe accelerometer and the height to which the payload is set before the drop. The\npayload will be set to a mark on the shafts of the test-rig to an accuracy of about\n0.125\". The impact velocity achieved will therefore be 15 +/- 0.819ft/s. Assuming\na crush thickness efficiency of 65% and a cushion thickness of 2\" are specified,\nEquation 3 yields an impact shock of 50 +/- 5.34g.\nCombining the uncertainty due to instrumentation accuracy and the height\nthe payload is set to, the uncertainty of the impact shock will be 5.43g. This\nrandom error means that maximum impact shock values that are within 5.34g of the\n\nmean of the distribution can not be attributed to variations in the impact attenuation\nmaterial, which is what the safety margin aims to account for.\nFinal Cushion Thickness Error\nSince the error in the dynamic crush thickness efficiency value and the\nrandom error in the impact shock are known, the error in the final cushion thickness\ncan be evaluated using Equations 4 and 5 as follows:\n\n_\n)\n)\n(\n(\n)\n(\n)\n)\n(\n(\nt\nt\nt\ncushion\nfinal\nd\nG\nG\ng\nv\nG\nd\nG\nG\ng\nv\nd\nη\nη\nη\nτ\n-\n∆\n+\n∆\n-\n∆\n=\n\n(Eq. 9)\nThe specifications to determine the final cushion thickness will be: an\nimpact shock of 50g, an impact velocity of 15ft/s and the crush thickness efficiency\nvalue that results from dynamic tests (assumed for this calculation to be 63%). The\nresulting uncertainty in the final cushion thickness evaluation is thus 0.3\". Note that\nthe bias errors are not included in this calculation because they will not affect the\nstandard deviation of the sample and therefore won't affect the safety margin\ndetermined.\n8.\nProject Planning\nThis project will be completed in the fall of 2003 during 16.622. The following\nsection includes the schedule for the completion of the project and the facilities and staff\nsupport that will be needed.

The weeks in which the major milestones of 16.622 are\ndue are also included. Note that the last two weeks to collect data will be allotted to the\ndevelopment and testing of the deployment mechanism for an EFIA that will allow the\nassessment of the secondary hypothesis as discussed in section 2.1. This includes data\nreduction of the deployment reliability tests that will run parallel to other tests. If a\ndeployment mechanism is not designed, work will be done to specify the functional\nrequirements of an eventual design.\n\nTable 5: 16.622 Schedule\nSeptember\nOctober\nNovember\nDecember\nWeek\n(week starts)\n8/9/2003 15/9/200\n322/9/200329/9/2003 6/10/2003 13/10/2003 20/10/2003 27/10/2003 3/11/2003 10/11/2003 17/11/2003 24/11/2003 1/12/2003 8/12/2003\nTeam meetings\nOral Progress report\nFinal Oral Report\nLAST DAY TO COLLECT DATA\nOutline due\nReport Due\nFamiliarize with LabVIEW and\nhigh-speed camera software\nGather materials and instrumentation\nAssemble test-rig and instrumentation\nConnect instrumentation and check software\nStatic Crush Thickness Efficiency tests\nDynamic crush thickness efficiency tests\nDate reduction for marginal cushion thickness\nSafety margin tests\nSafety margin data reduction\nVolume measurements\nWork on secondary hypothesis\nPrepare outline for report\nWrite report\n\n8.2\nFacilities and Staff Support\n- The Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics machine shop and the help and\nguidance of Donald Weiner\n- The strong wall at the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics and the help of\nRichard Perdichizzi to gather instrumentation and materials\n- The Instron force press at the MIT Telac laboratories and the guidance of John Kane\n9.\nSummary\nThis project will assess whether expanding foam can be a low-cost alternative for\nimpact attenuation of payloads delivered by small aircraft, as it minimizes pre-deployment\nvolume as compared to paper honeycomb. The crush thickness efficiency tests will help\nestablish whether the expanding foam used in Instapak products can provide appropriate\nimpact attenuation as paper honeycomb has been shown to do. The safety margin tests are\nnecessary to have a high level of confidence that the prescribed cushion thickness of impact\nattenuation material will protect a payload of specific characteristics. It is taking into\naccount this safety margin that a comparison of the pre-deployment volume of the two\nimpact attenuation materials will be done. These tests cater to the primary success criteria\nof the project.\nAn attempt will be done to satisfy the secondary success criteria. This success\ndepends on the completed design of a way to implement expanding foam to a very specific\nsituation. If this design is not completed, detail functional requirements will be determined.\nThe deployment reliability tests will aid the fulfillment of this goal.\n\nThe successful completion of this project can be aspired to thanks to the enthusiastic\nsupport of the 16.62X technical staff, the guidance of the 16.62X faculty, and Christian\nAnderson's unconditional encouragement.\n\n10.
