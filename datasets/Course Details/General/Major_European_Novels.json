The first of these ideas underlies much of our modern regard for the novel as a literary form-namely, the idea that if fiction intends to deal with the most important forces animating the collective life of humanity, it will not deal with the actions of persons of immense consequence--kings, princes, high elected officials and the like--but rather with the lives of apparently ordinary people and the everyday details of their social ambitions and desires: to use a phrase of Balzac's, with \"\nce qui se passe partout\n\" (what happens everywhere). This idea sometimes goes with another: that the most significant representations of the human condition are those dealing with a particular type of protagonist-namely, with someone not obviously qualified to be of consequence in the world (by reason, say, of birth or inheritance) but nonetheless conceives of himself or herself as destined for great accomplishment and who tries to compel society to accept him or her as its agent.\n\nThe readings begin for the sake of contrast with a comic representation of this second idea, Part One of Cervantes's masterpiece,\nDon Quixote\n, which pokes fun at the idea that one can elect oneself as a person of destiny and which also introduces into narrative fiction a quality with which later novels will be much occupied-a kind of teasing inquiry into the various devices by which narratives tends to endow characters with importance. We then turn to serious representations of the idea in nineteenth century fiction: Balzac's\nOld Goriot\n, Stendhal's\nThe Red and the Black\n, Flaubert's\nMadame Bovary\n, Dostoyevsky's\nCrime and Punishment\n, and Tolstoy's\nAnna Karenina\n. Endowing characters with extraordinary intensity, these books constitute part of the main line of what is called the realistic tradition of novelistic representation. In reading them, we will consider the distinctions to be drawn between these texts and the two other main traditions of novelistic fiction in Europe-the romantic tradition, which endows characters with attributes which obviously qualify them for consequence in the world, and also the tradition of naturalism, which deals with characters more subdued in their relation to the social forces that constrain their lives. Four of these six texts are works of considerable length; an effort will be made to keep the reading within the limits of approximately 250 pages while reading them.\n\nCourse Format\n\nAs a Communication-Intensive Course, this subject requires 20 pages in writing, divided into three assignments as indicated below. The first of these assignments will be rewritten upon its return and resubmitted in a form complaint with corrections made by the instruction on the pages of the first version. This subject will offer students substantial opportunity for oral expression by reason of (a) its discussion format and (b) a division into groups of two or three students (depending upon enrollment), each of which will make two fifteen-minute presentations of materials conducive to the discussion of a given assignment, following the model of such presentations offered by the instructor at the outset of the term. The maximum number of students per section of this subject is 18, except in cases where there are no sections and where a writing fellow is attached to the subject, in which case the enrollment can rise to 25.\n\nThe subject meets twice a week for two ninety-minute sessions. Each session begins with a lecture of varying length, usually running for twenty-minutes to half an hour, although the lectures of the first two meetings will be somewhat longer. The rest of the session is devoted to class-discussion of the materials assigned for the session. Participation in discussion is essential to the life of the class and the force and cogency of students' remarks will have a marked influence on grades. Much of the grade will also depend upon the quality of the three written assignments required by the course: an early paper (running from five to seven pages) a mid-term paper (running from seven to nine pages) and a final paper (running from ten to twelve pages). The papers will each deal with some aspect of the readings and discussion; topics may be invented by the students but an extensive list of suggested topics will be circulated two weeks in advance of each paper's due date for those students who require it.\n\nSummary Calendar\n\nLEC #\n\nTOPICS\n\nKEY DATES\n\nIntroduction\n\n2-4\n\nCervantes,\nDon Quixote\n(excerpts)\n\n5-7\n\nBalzac,\nPere Goriot\n\n8-11\n\nStendhal,\nThe Red and the Black\n\nPaper 1 due in Lec #11\n\n12-15\n\nFlaubert,\nMadame Bovary\n\n16-19\n\nDostoyevsky,\nCrime and Punishment\n\nPaper 2 due in Lec #19\n\n20-24\n\nTolstoy,\nAnna Karenina\n\n25-26\n\nTo be announced\n\nPaper 3 due in Lec #26",

Consider three notions of the idea of \"viewpoint\" in connection with this novel, and also with the\nothers that we will read:\na.\nThe interests that animate the various characters or supply their motives and thereby\nexplain their actions; the value that they put on things.\nb.\nThe values that the narrative itself seems to espouse in the way that it disposes of\ncharacters and deals with their ambitions in working out the plot; what used to be called the\nsense of \"poetic justice\" that the story exhibits in making each character wind up a certain way.\nc.\nThe way in which what any given character knows jibes with or seems to provide the\ninformation that the narrative voice conveys. For example, \"Paul's eyes glittered as he spoke\"\ncannot express the viewpoint of Paul. It may express the viewpoint of someone in the story (in\nthis case the person or persons to whom Paul is speaking), or it may express a viewpoint\nimpossible to anyone in the story. In this text, the narrative viewpoint is largely identical with\nEugene, its protagonist; the narrative voice even remarks at one moment that \"were it not for the\nfriendship between these two people [Eugene and Goriot], we might never have learned the\noutcome of this story.\" Since the story is a fiction, there is something odd about such an\nassertion. What is the point of tying the narrative viewpoint so closely to the viewpoint of a\nsingle character in a story when the story is not narrated in the first person? How many points\ncan you identify where the narrative viewpoint is not available to Eugene?\n2. Compare the tone of the narrative voice at the outset of Don Quixote with the tone of the first\nparagraphs of Pere Goriot? The voice insists that \"this is not a novel\". What is the point of this\nassertion?\n3. What does the word \"success\" mean in this book? What does the idea of \"a career\" mean? What\ndoes the word \"society\" mean? Compare the viewpoint of Madame de Beauseant with the viewpoint\nof Vautrin on \"society\". Eugene thinks to himself that they are the same. Are they?\n4. How does Eugene win the affection of Mme de Beauseant when he first meets her? How\ncharacteristic is what he says at that moment of the ways in which people relate in the book? Do you\nbelieve that you would be as adept as Eugene in understanding motives and knowing what to say?\nMore adept? Less?\n5. Eugene discovers the existence of \"triangular domesticity\". What does this phrase mean? What\nsort of world is it in which love and marriage are acknowledged as distinct forms of commitment?\nUnder what conditions in the world that Balzac depicts can a man be humiliated by others knowing\nthat his wife is having an affair with another man? Why is the Vicontesse de Beauseant humiliated by\nthe public knowledge that the man she loves is about to marry an hieress?\n6. Why is the novel called Pere Goriot? Is it badly named by its author? How did Goriot make his\nmoney and why is his existence an embarrassment to his sons-in-law?\n7. What keeps Eugene from marrying Vittorine de Taiffer and achieving his ambitions in this way?\nWhy does he not inform the police of Vautrin's murderous scheme with regard to Vittorine's brother?\n8. Vautrin despises morality but professes to be absolutely trustworthy. Does he have any fixed\nprinciples of conduct or is he simply a villain? He says: \"There are no principles, only events.\" What\ndoes the phrase mean? Explain in this context the problem posed by the \"puzzle of the Mandarin\"\nwhich Eugene elaborate to his friend Bianchon. What is the point of the puzzle?\nBalzac, Pere Goriot\n\n21L472\n\nMAJOR EUROPEAN NOVELS\nProfessor Kibel\n\nReading Study and Discussion Questions\n9. Money is very important to the characters in Pere Goriot and seems constantly to invade their\nlives. \"Mixing money with love,\" says Delphine; \"It's awful!\" Is it awful? Why do the various\ncharacters need so much money? And why are the sums involved left so unspecific?\n10.\"He [Eugene] had seen the three attitudes of men toward the world: obedience, struggle, and\nrevolt; the family, society, and Vautrin. He dared not choose among them.\" Explicate this passage.\nWhy dare Eugene not choose among them\n11.The last thing that Eugene does is \"to throw down the gauntlet to society by going to dine with\nDelphine.\" What is the implication of this phrase? How does Eugene wind up in his struggles between\na desire for success and his hesitations about the means? Would he have been better to emulate\nBianchon or accept the offer of Vautrin?\n12.In the world of Balzac's Paris, power depends, paradoxically, upon the appearance of having\npower; that is why for those who want power, being mocked by the raised eyebrow of a servant can\nhumiliate so deeply. (You might try explaining, in connection with this notion of the power of\nappearances, both the wit and the appropriateness of Rastignac's remark about his tailor: \"I know two\npairs of his trousers that have made marriages worth twenty thousand francs a year.\" [p. 99.]) In\ncontrast, Don Quixote's power is all delusion, but also paradoxically, his delusion is such that he can\nnever be convinced that he doesn't have any, and so he cannot be humiliated. Comment on the theme\nof humiliation or upon the contrast just drawn.\nBalzac, Pere Goriot"

It proved, nonetheless, popular with all types, even the illiterate, who\nhad to listen to it read aloud. To understand the book, we have to understand the world of human\nconnection and activity as Cervantes would have understood it-grasping some of the assumptions that\nwould have guided Cervantes in writing the book (possibly without even knowing that he was doing so)\nand that he would have expected his readers to project into it, as the background to its action. The social\nworld as Cervantes understood it was hierarchical, stratified, even as ours is, but in it, unlike ours, one's\nposition was determined largely by birth. I distinguish six groups:\n1. Royalty and Upper Nobility: These were people whose names each had a history\nbehind it, a record of important accomplishment in defending and extending the interests of large\nnumbers of dependents, not just members of their family. Their name was associated with a distinct\nterritory, with lands, villages, even towns and the people that went with them. (Shakespeare calls\nCleopatra \"Egypt\", the King of France \"France\", the duke of Kent \"Kent\". We would not call the\nPresident of the United States \"United States\".) Without some connection to the name, people of a\nlesser sort would live in relative obscurity, known by name only to their acquaintances, but through\ntheir connection to the name they acquire a larger identity. The name, even if you did not bear it as\nyour own, gave you your social identity-you were so-and-so's servant, bailiff, seneschal, man-at-arms,\nresident of town, village or hamlet in the keeping of the lord, the chief member of the family directly\nidentified by the name. You paid the lord, and thereby the family, tithes and taxes and submitted to\nvarious forms of service, including armed service, for which you might be selected at random or by\nlot; in return, the one bearing the name provided managerial oversight and justice in the territory\nthrough appointed agents and security from invasion and plunder; thereby, he gave you your\nsubstance in the world at large. Not only did your fortunes rise and fall with those of the bearer of the\nname; you had a defined claim on the attention of the world only in relation to the lord. One who\ncould not claim dependency on the person bearing the name (at whatever remove) had no social being,\neither in the local community or elsewhere. He or she was a nobody.\n2. Lesser Nobility: The bearer of the name could be advanced in title as a reward for\nservice to someone higher in the ranks of nobility. A gift of lands (carrying with it lordship over those\nwho dwelt therein) was part of this advancement. One might suppose that sooner or later all the lands\nwould be duly allotted and no more nobles created, but territories changed hands in war, and\nadvancement was generally consequent upon performance in battle. (And there was always the\nconquest of the New World.) Titles already existing were transmitted by birth, generally by\nprimogeniture-that is to say, they devolved upon the eldest male offspring. Siblings of the eldest male\nmight gain ascent to the upper nobility by distinguished military achievement, duly rewarded by the\nlord's lord; otherwise, if male, they staffed the upper cadres of the military, serving under the lord\nwho bore the family name (and the name of its territories) or under the banner of the lord's lord. Or\nthey might join the clergy and become part of the upper clergy-bishops and archbishops. (Sancho's\ndream that Don Quixote might become an archbishop was as crazy as the notion that he might marry\na princess. The upper clergy was closed to anyone of rank below that of the lesser nobility.) In the\nbook, Don Fernando belongs to this class; this is why it is to Cardenio's advantage to be of service to\nhim.\n3. Upper Gentry: These were people of real consequence within the territory of a lord; they\nhad amassed large areas of property and wealth of various kinds and been adding to it for several\ngenerations, but they had no genealogical history, no public lineage that might be put, say, on a coat-\nof-arms. Their grandfather or great-grandfather might be remembered for bravery in battle or dignity\nin local office, but no one besides other members of the family derived their social identities from\nsuch a person. They remain relatively obscure. Dorotea, Lucinda, Cardenio, the two friends in the\nstory of \"ill-advised curiosity\" belong to this class. The rule for advancement here is explained by\nDorotea; a member of the lower nobility might take someone of her class for a wife, because ancestry\nCervantes, Don Quixote\n\n21L472\n\nMAJOR EUROPEAN NOVELS\nProfessor Kibel\n\nReading Study and Discussion Questions\nwas not so important when traced back through the female line as it was when traced back through the\nmale-this fact reflects the rules for inheriting the name and the territories going with it. For the same\nreason, a female of the lower nobility would not marry beneath her. (In Shakespeare's Twelfth Night\nwhen the comic villain of the piece, Malvolio, comes to believe that the noble woman he serves might\ntake him for a husband, he is regarded as a madman by the other characters.)\n4. Lower Gentry: This is the class to which Don Quixote belongs and Cervantes as well.\nDon Quixote is often described as possessed of heroic ambitions in a world that doesn't afford\nopportunity for heroic ambitions, and he talks at one point, sadly, about how hard it is to be knight\nwhen any peasant at a distance can shoot you off your horse, but his foolishness, nonetheless, is not\njust a foolishness about mixing up fiction and truth or about heroic achievement in a world that\naffords no opportunity for heroic achievement. (There still seems to be opportunity for heroism in\nmilitary service among the lower gentry, for example, in the war against the Turks, in which\nCervantes and his fictional \"Captive\" took part.) To a contemporary reader, Don Quixote's ambition\nwould carry an air of misguided social importance. The assumption of the title \"Don\" (equivalent to\n\"Lord\") is a piece of social effrontery and when the Don wants Sancho to address him as \"his natural\nlord and master\", his madness is making him act too big for his social britches. Don Quixote's excess\nin this connection is indicated by his discourse about the two kinds of lineage in the world (in chapter\nXXI)-a piece of upside-down logic, in which Don Quixote argues that he must have a noble ancestor\njust because he is not noble himself. To continue the list of characters who belong to the lower gentry:\nLeandra (in the goatherd's story) belongs here, as do the Captive and his siblings; the success of the\nlast three in the military, the judiciary, and the world of business indicate that forms of social\nadvancement are available to them, but there is no chance that they will penetrate to the rank of lower\nnobility. Marcella, the mock-shepherdess (she isn't keeping sheep for a living) belongs here, too.\n5. Students Belong to Both Lower and Upper Gentries: They train for either the clergy\n(all universities of the time were originally founded to train in theology) or law. University training\nwas not required for a Bishopric or Archbishopric; these ranks were closed to the gentry and the lower\nnobility who occupied them did not take on student status. The curate belongs to the gentry; he'll\nnever become a bishop. (After all, he keeps company with the town barber.) The canon represents a\nrank higher in the range accessible to members of the gentry. Being literate, members of the lower\ngentry are particularly inclined to model themselves on literary types, and they take to the woods,\nadopting the roles of shepherds and rustic poets, in some ways as we might choose to spend time, like\nGeorge W. Bush, running a ranch, doing carpentry, studying art or vacationing on a dude ranch. Are\nthey silly to do this sort of thing? They have read pastoral poems, in which shepherds and\nshepherdesses are represented as simplified versions of literate people, who spend their time\ncomposing poetry, while the sheep take care of themselves; in the sixties and seventies, American\nstudents did much the same thing part-time, living in communes, dressing liked cowboys, and\ncomposing folk ballads on electric guitars.\nMembers of the gentry can certainly improve their fortunes and their status within the group to which\nthey belong; if male, they can become soldier-mercenaries or seek fortune in arms in a company\nbound for the New World, or they might enter the clergy (Don Quixote's discourse on the relative\nmerits of the military and religious vocations in chapter XXXVIII would have had a genuine interest\nfor his original readership) but there is a \"glass ceiling\", a limit to how high the gentry can rise in\neither career. Their name may become memorable (like those of the brave commanders extolled by\nthe curate to the landlord at the inn in chapter XXXII), but no one outside their family will derive a\nsense of their social reality, that is, of their own relative importance in the world, by reason of relation\nto that name. (Don Quixote's grandfather, he insists, had behaved gallantly in some battle or other; the\nfact is important to him and locals might know about it, but it confers no inheritable social\ndistinction.)\n6. Common Folk: Sancho, the landlord and his wife, Maritornes, various muleteers and the\nlike that Don Quixote encounters on the road and at inns. These are the good, often illiterate folk, who\nare quite unrefined and do the labors of the world for those above them.\nCervantes, Don Quixote\n\n21L472\n\nMAJOR EUROPEAN NOVELS\nProfessor Kibel\n\nReading Study and Discussion Questions\nThe point about these class divisions is two-fold. First, no one imagines that the world's hierarchy\nof authority can be reinvented or new parts of it created. The world's hierarchy of authority has the\nauthority of God behind it. That is why authority by birth is so important; life is granted or withheld,\nwombs made fruitful or barren for a reason, even if we do not understand it, and people are suited to the\nstation in which they are born. In this conception of things, therefore, an immense stability is imputed to the\nworld's arrangements; however violently human activity may displace its order, the world will return to its\nstable, enduring dispositions (or else-Shakespeare considers this possibility in some plays-devolve into\nchaos). Some mobility of social position is granted, but Don Quixote's idea that he has nobility in his blood\nis lunacy. In the \"books of chivalry\" that have addled his brains, things work the other way about: the\nunknown stranger, the very type who has no social identity, no position in the world whatever, turns out to\nbe of noble descent-an idea entertained as an amiable joke in comic plots from the ancient world down to\nGilbert and Sullivan. Our own world, of course, share something of Don Quixote's view; however much\nsocial mobility is or is not a fact, we believe in it, both as a reality and as an ideal. Parents generally want\ntheir children to \"do better\" than themselves, not just by way of income, but also in manner of life, and we\nfreely invent new orders of authority or shuffle existing ones about both within corporations and the nation-\nstate. Authority may still be thought to have God behind it, but the enduring features of the social world are\nnot established by birth.\nSecond, the delineation of people in literary fiction must allow readers to recognize what sort of person the\ndelineation represents. All fiction operates with implicit rules about the range and kinds of consequence\nthat characters might have in the world, depending upon the conditions of their existence, their social rank,\ntheir stage of life, and also with the range and kinds of effect that chance or other people's designs can\nimpose upon them. This is to say that characters in fiction possess typical as well as individuals traits,\nreflecting something of the division of people into groups in the real world. Since we believe in social\nmobility, our fictions tend to privilege individual traits; typical characters and formulaic plots will abound-\nthe intelligibility of fiction cannot do without them-but they will be qualified by a predominant assumption\nthat people can redefine their possibilities and that it makes sense to worry about what they are. In contrast,\nthanks to the tight relation that was supposed to obtain in Cervantes's day between individual identity and\nan enduring social hierarchy, fiction was expected to privilege typical over individual traits; characters in\nfiction were expected to embody habits, ambitions, motives, hopes, and general dispositions that ran close\nto type.\nThe typicality of character need not be simply a matter of social rank (for example, jealousy is typically\ndifferent in young and old, in husbands and bachelors) but it will always be discernably touched by social\nrank. A character like Don Fernando, a member of the lower nobility, would be unsuitable as a comic\nfigure in a book as accepting of social distinctions as is Don Quixote. He will never have \"his cheeks\nbathed in blood\" in the course of a fist-fight; he will not struggle over saddlebags or have lengthy\narguments with a servant, and be vomited upon by a comic assistant, as Don Quixote is vomited upon by\nSancho in the episode of Fierebras's balsam. Any portrayal that gave him such possibilities as a character\nwould be implausible, lacking in verisimilitude, unbelievable, even though the real world might supply\nplenty of examples of atypical nobility. He also has greater latitude than a member of the gentry when it is\na question of overcoming one's lapses of character in response to the love of a beautiful woman. Don\nQuixote takes such limitations in fiction as rules for conducting oneself in the real world (in this case, as a\nmember of the lower nobility if you happen to be one); to some extent, he is correct, but Don Quixote has\nbeen reading the wrong sort of books, the implausible kind, which do not portray characters adequately in\nrespect of social reality. Further, he supposes that the rules may be easily read out of fiction, as if they were\nmanuals of instruction-telling you what is proper and improper behavior among members of a particular\nsocial group. This is of a piece with the Don's literalism-his sense that books of chivalry incorporate all\nrelevant minor details of the action truthfully, and if something is not mentioned, its absence must be in\naccord with a rule of behavior. The Don does not grasp that in fiction there are rules about irrelevant\ndetails-what needn't be made explicit because the competent reader will take them for granted. Don\nQuixote is an incompetent reader-he supposes that omitted details signify something about the impropriety\nof the details with regard to knightly conduct. (One might contrast the Don's failure here with his\nimpatience over Sancho's ferrying of goats, where Sancho is the literalist and Don Quixote, for a change, is\na sensible reader.)\nCervantes, Don Quixote\n\n21L472\n\nMAJOR EUROPEAN NOVELS\nProfessor Kibel\n\nReading Study and Discussion Questions\nThere seem to be two aspects to the Don's literary madness-the first concerns what makes fiction\nplausible, believable, verisimilar (like the truth); the second concerns how the rules governing plausibility\nin fiction may be translated into rules for behavior in fact. In a book concerned with reading and the nature\nof fiction, it is unsurprising to find explicit discussions of these topics among the characters themselves.\nInspired by Don Quixote's antics, sensible readers like the curate or canon talk about the nature of fiction\nand its relation to fact. In all literary fiction, there is a kind of pruning and simplification going on; there is\nalso what we might call an excess of meaning granted to the actions of characters, a larger scope for\nsuccess or failure, than is available in the real world. In connection with these two features, the theory of\nfiction subscribed to by the curate and canon is roughly Aristotelian in nature, appealing to the notion that\nfiction idealizes its subject-matter in order to offer humanity a clearer glimpse than history can furnish of\nwhat is most typical about human relationships, particularly in martial exercise and in matters of love.\nWhat is verisimilar(like the truth) need not be truthful; what is believable may not be true. Worth-while\nbooks provide models for imitation, in the sense of offering an ideal that is worth living up to; the truth that\ncan be found in them is ethical truth. Worth-while books, however, need not be relentlessly lofty or\ninspirational. There is, evidently, a range of genres, or literary kinds, extending from the epic (which deals\nwith legendary heroes), exemplary tales, like the story of inappropriate curiosity (which deals with gentry)\nor the captive's tale, and there is even room for outright fantasy (but not enchantment) in pastoral romances,\nwhich present images of what simple refinement was like when all people were country people, the\ncorruptions of civilization had not yet come into existence, and nobody had to spend a lot of time working\nfor a living. Because such idealizations are exemplars (object meant to be imitated), their depiction engages\nrules about what should not be said in relations to them; it would be improper to describe the personal\ntoiletry of an exemplary character in a heroic work of fiction, for example. These fictive characters are a\nvaluable kind of artifice, and the ruder necessities of life do not touch their description or receive mention\nin accounts of their activities. (It becomes important not to say of an exemplar of beauty, capable of\ninspiring good in a man, that she has a faint moustache, hair on her legs, sweats heavily, experiences\nmenstrual cramps, or knows anything about sexual practice.) Exemplary characters still exist in modern\nfictions, but the nature of their exemplarity has changed somewhat since Cervantes's day. In consequence,\nthe presence of Cardenio, Dorotea, or the Captive's Zoraida may cause us to raise an eyebrow where\nverisimilitude is concerned-they seem so unlike our notions of realistic characters.\nWhat sort of a book is Don Quixote, then? Don Quixote is a comedy, a mode having its own genres, all\ndealing precisely with the material, circumstantial, ruder aspects of life, and how they interfere with the\nambitions of those unsuited to be exemplars, mere pretenders to authority, refinement, grace, courage and\nintelligence (or in the case of clowns, mere pretenders to simple competence with physical objects). We\nnote, for example, that Don Quixote's pretensions to enchantment are momentarily undone near the end of\nBook One by his need to do \"what a man can do only for himself\". And yet Don Quixote is not all comedy,\nfor it includes the so-called \"interpolated\" tales, which are exemplary fictions, and even writes exemplary\ncharacters into the main body of the story. (Sancho reports at the outset of Part II that readers find the\nexemplary aspects of the book an annoying interruption of the really good bits-the comedy of Quixote's\nadventures and his conversations with Sancho.) It is the exemplary characters who talk about fiction and\nwho remark of Don Quixote that if you found him in work of fiction, you wouldn't find him believable. In\nthis respect, quite apart from its rhetorical achievements, the genius of Don Quixote is two-fold. First, it\ncombines exemplary characters with comic ones, one of the first books to do so-confronting, let us say, the\nmad Cardenio, whose fictive derangement is in accord with the type of manly loved betrayed by its ideal\nobject, with the madness of Quixote, who, fictively mad himself, pretends to go mad in compliance with\nthe best literary examples and cannot do it properly. And second, it provides a comic figure whose\npretensions all turn upon misconceptions about literature. In inventing such a figure, the text not only\nprompts its characters to engage in discussion about the nature of fiction; it also, by way of further\nentertainment, involves the reader in a continual series of jokes and games about what he or she is doing-\nreading a book, in which only the madman believes that things happen as they do because they are fit to be\nrepresented in a book.\nIt is this aspect of the Don Quixote that has chiefly attracted modern critics.

Compare him in this\nrespect with Vautrin and also with that aspect of Julien Sorel's character in The Red and the Black\nwhich leads Julien to blame Prince Altamira for not committing a series of murders that would\nhave undeniably benefitted the mass of humanity. How contemporary is the idea of \"transgressing\nin principle\"? Is it a possibility that confronts political leaders today in their efforts to \"make war\non terrorism\"? Has it anything to do with the motives of terrorism itself?\n2.\nAnd yet, unlike Prince Altamira or a modern political leader, Raskolnikov is not in a position to\nconfer benefits on the mass of humanity. He is only a penniless student. Why, then, does he\ncommit his crime? He gives three accounts of his motive in one of his interviews with Sonya late\nin the book. What are his three explanations of his motives? Are they in harmony with each other?\nIf not, are any valid?\n3.\nIn that interview, Raskolnikov identifies himself with Sonya-or, rather, he identifies her with\nhimself. \"It makes no difference whether you sacrifice yourself or another,\" he says; \"the act is\nstill wanton and criminal.\" Is there any sense in this identification?\n4.\nRaskolnikov has written an article explaining or justifying the position of someone like Altimira\n(in The Red and the Black), only he has Napoleon in mind. The transgressor, he says, violates the\nmorality of the present because he represents the future-his acts look wrong in the eyes of the\npresent but the future will acknowledge their worth. Expound some details of Raskolnikov's\ntheory. Razumihin, Raskolnikov's friend, says that Raskolnikov's theory is more horrible than \"the\nofficial justification for murder\". What is the official justification to which Razumihin is referring\nand is he correct in his assessment?\n5.\nThere are five dreams in the story. Four of them are dreamed by Raskolnikov, and the first\nconcerns an old mare who is flogged to death by the peasant who owns it. How does the dream\nrelate to the waking events of the story? The dream convinces Raskolnikov for the moment to\nabandon his project of killing the old pawnbroker. But the pawnbroker is a vicious exploiter of the\npoor and the mare a helpless servant of her master. Is there some discrepancy here? Why does the\ndream have the effect (if only temporarily) that it does?\n6.\nRaskolnikov is reckless in distributing his few kopeks to those who need charity, but he responds\nto charity with anger. Among other things, Dounia (his sister) is offering to sacrifice herself for\nhim by making a loveless marriage, and in refusing this offer he responds to it with hatred, not\nwith gratitude. Is his response the right one?\n7.\nLuzhin, Dounia's suitor, has a theory of ethical conduct which is tied to the idea of economic\nprogress. Razumihin immediately identifies this theory with a license to murder, which startles\nLuzhin. Is there any justification in Razumihin's view?\n8.\nSome of the characters in the book have a powerful wish to humiliate others-Luzhin or\nSvigdrigailov, for example-while others seem eager to humiliate themselves-Marmeladov and Mrs\nSvigdrigailov are instances of this. The idea of humiliation figures importantly in the careers of\nEugene de Rastignac (in Pere Goriot) and Julien Sorel (in The Red and the Black). In\nDostoyevsky, it is tied to the idea of public exposure and public confession. It is urged upon\nRaskolnikov as the path of redemption by Sonya and also by the public investigator, Porfiry. How\nwould you account for the differences in the notion of humiliation in the three books?\n9.\nCrime and Punishment has been filmed no less than five times. In all versions, the character of\nSvigdrigailov is omitted. How important is Svigdrigailov to the story? Surely, the plot can be\nmanaged without him. What difference to the book's overall effect does his presence make?\nDostoyevsky, Crime and Punishment.\n\n21L472\n\nMAJOR EUROPEAN NOVELS\nProfessor Kibel\n\nReading Study and Discussion Questions\n10. Psychology, observes Porfiry, is a double-edged sword; it cuts both ways. He is referring here to\nthe incapacity of psychology to fathom motives, when people can \"double bluff\". For example, a\ncriminal thinks: \"Only a guilty person would do such a thing. I am a guilty person and may be\nsuspected; therefore I will forestall suspicion by doing such a thing blatantly. Thereby I will\nconvince people that I am not guilty, for the thing that I do is such a give-away that a guilty person\nwould never do it. By doing it, I will establish my innocence in their eyes.\" Both Raskolnikov and\nPorfiry \"double-bluff\" each other. Examine this notion closely in relation to any passage where it\nseems relevant and try to say something about how this notion of \"cutting both ways\" ties in with\nthe nature of the characters who resort to this practice.\n11. Raskolnikov tries to alert a policeman to the plight of a young woman at the outset of the book,\nbut after he arouses the policeman to protect her, he shouts: \"Leave her alone. Why is she your\nbusiness?\" Again, he has occasion to think \"Mankind is vile,\" but immediately adds: \"But the\nperson who calls mankind vile is really contemptible.\" How would you account for these violent\nswings of mood?\n12. The dream in the book that does not belong to Raskolnikov is dreamed by Svigdrigailov; it\nconcerns a poor suffering child who is revealed during the course of the dream to be a perverted\nchild-harlot. What is the significance of this dream and how does it bear upon Svigdrigailov's\ntreatment of women?\nDostoyevsky, Crime and Punishment."

You must focus your essay on either Crime and Punishment or Anna\nKarenina, but you may institute a direct comparison between one of these two texts and any other, in\nwhich case attention may be evenly divided.\nThemes and Topics\n1. Compare Julien Sorel's moods of doubt, where he wonders whether he is worthy of his destiny, with\nRaskolnikov's humiliation at the thought that he, too, is just a \"louse\". After being offered a cushy\npartnership with Foque (his friend, the wood-dealer) Julien worries that putting off his career in order to\nget the money to pay for his seminary training would be an expression of weakness, then worries if his\nworries about being weak aren't themselves an expression of weakness. You might compare this with\nRaskolnikov's explanation to Dounia (Part VI, ch. 7) about why he didn't kill himself or his remark to\nSonia that the most humiliating thing of all was that he knew in advance that anyone who had to test\nhimself for greatness had already flunked the self-proposed test.\n2. The Sense of Duty in ____________.\n3. The theme of Mediocrity as treated in ______________.\n4. One might say of Madame Bovary that it is a book in which nothing happens. (Up to a point, that is\nthe complaint of the heroine.) One might say of Crime and Punishment that it is a book in which dramatic\ncrises occur on virtually every page. Comment.\n5. The Voice of Immoralism: Vautrin and Svigdrigailov. (Note: \"Immoralism\" is not \"immorality\"; it\nimplies making some sort of immorality a principle of behavior, a cause to be recommended or\nforwarded.)\n6. The Country and the Town\n7. The theme of humiliation in Pere Goriot and Crime and Punishment. You might compare Eugene's\nreadiness to take insult from the sneer of a footman and Raskolnikov's readiness to take insult from the\ngift of charity or a sacrifice for his sake by another; or you might contrast the bravery of Mme de\nBeauseant in enduring the gaze of all in high society at her ball after being jilted by d'Ajuda Pinto with the\nmeekness of Sonia, who does not respond with anger to humiliation by another, no matter how severe.\n8. Anna and Levin as counterparts.\n9. I repeat some remarks from an earlier assignment. Characters in novels cannot be immediately related\nto readers in point of some notion of potential for acting in an admirable way (admirable in any sense, not\njust in an ethical sense). The reader cannot always say, \"How inferior--I'm more clever or more honest or\nmore brave than that!\" The introductory paragraphs of Pere Goriot might be taken as warning the reader\nnot to assume his or her superiority to the characters. The implication here is that the reader doesn't know\nas much as the author about the depths of life or is already too jaded by the pressures of success to\nappreciate these depths; the novel, however, knows better and the reader should not suppose that because\none character is a fool with regard to his children another learns to get the better of his conscience. the\n\nreader is entitled to believe himself or herself superior to them. Or, to take a more complicated instance,\nStendhal sketches a world at the outset of The Red and the Black in which knowing what you want-\nwhich in our own lives is usually taken as a mark of good sense--is not a sign of superiority but of\nweakness or meanness or narrowness of character. Discuss in any way that seems suitable the implied\nstrength or weakness of the characters of a novel relative to the reader.\n10. The distinction between primary and secondary characters: what makes for the difference (not entirely\na matter of the number of pages on which they appear--Svigdrigailov is arguably a major figure, but fewer\npages are devoted to him than to Razumihin) in relation to the major concerns of the text, to the plot (the\ndrama of events), to the way in which the narrative voice of the text deals with them. The issue is\nparticularly acute in Anna Karenina--is Karenin, is Vronsky, is Stepan Oblonsky a primary or a secondary\ncharacter?\n11. One distinction often drawn between primary and secondary characters in novels is that primary\ncharacters can \"see around themselves\"--that is, they can view themselves as others see them, have a\ncritical awareness of their own failings, place some distance between themselves and their social roles\nwhereas secondary characters seem to be \"all of a piece\", so closely are their concerns, their actions and\neven their self-awareness defined by their social position or their economic interests. The contrast\nbetween, say, Julien Sorel and M. de Renal turns upon drawing the distinction in this way; and it serves as\nwell in many books that we haven't read--the novels of Jane Austen or Charles Dickens, for example.\nBut in both Dostoyevsky and Tolstoy, the distinction doesn't seem to work. Consider for example, the\nfollowing passage describing Luzhin's thoughts, in his final quarrel with Dounia: \"In bitterly reminding\nDounia just now that he had decided to take her in spite of the bad rumors about her, he had spoken quite\nsincerely and even felt deeply indignant at such 'black ingratitude' and yet he had already been fully\nconvinced of the absurdity of this gossip and knew that she had been vindicated in the eyes of the village.\"\nAnna Karenina is full of characters who have flashes of insight rivaling that of the narrative's voice into\ntheir character. M. de Renal is not presented as capable of something like this. Comment.\n12. Psychology, observes Porfiry, the criminal investigator, is a double-edged sword\n(or, as our\ntranslation says, it is \"double-ended\"); it cuts both ways. With Raskolnikov, Porfiry plays a curious cat-\nand-mouse game, by putting himself in the place of the criminal, who will try double-bluffs. (If I were\nguilty, I'd say this; a single bluff would be not to say it; but I'll do a double-bluff and say it openly.) What\nis the point of the double-bluff? How does Porfiry respond to it? Examine this notion closely in relation\nto any passages in the novel that you choose and try to say something about how this notion of \"cutting\nboth ways\" ties in with the doubleness of the Dostoyevskian characters mentioned in the previous\nquestion.\n13. The motive for murder in Crime and Punishment. (There are at least three, but you needn't discuss all\nof them, although comparing them and deciding how to relate them to each other would be a good topic.)\n14. A version of the latter: Raskolnikov's \"theory of the great man\" (or the student's theory of murder,\noffered in the coversation that Raskolnikov overhears between a student and an officer in a cafe) and\nEugene's mandarin. Is Raskolnikov's theory (or the student's) simply another version of the dilemma that\nEugene found in Rousseau?\n15. The dreams in Crime and Punishment and their relation to the larger concerns of the text. (You can\nfasten on any number and you can pose any issue about them. We dealt with three in class--how does\n\"the dream of the mare\" function in relation to the scheme that Raskolnikov have in mind at the time the\ndream comes to him, a time at which he has no intention of killing Lisaveta? How does the dream of\nkilling the old pawnbroker, who laughs at him while he kills her, fit in with Raskolnikov's feelings at that\npoint in the novel? And finally, the set of Svigdrigailov's dreams, which culminate in the dream of the\nchild-prostitute.)\n\n16. The world in this text is one in which it makes arguable sense to say (as Raskolnikov says to Sonya),\n\"it makes no difference whether you sacrifice yourself or another; the act is still wanton and criminal\".\nMany different characters argue for the view that the sense of right and wrong possessed by most people\nis merely the expression of prejudice, the effects of environment, the results of circumstance and\nconditioning. (Raskolnikov's article is an extreme version of this point of view.) It is in connection with\nthis view that Raskolnikov wants to convince Sonia that her sacrifice for her family is just the same as a\ncrime. Judgments of good and bad are not always the expression of prejudice, but they are usually; the\nreal character of goodness derives from the capacity of an action to serve the cause of enlightened self-\ninterest. (Enlightened self-interest might suggest obeying the law or helping others to become enlightened,\nso that they would be less likely to to harm you, either directly or indirectly, by contributing to general\ndisorder.) It follows that by sacrificing her chances in life for the sake of people who will not be helped\nby her actions, Sonia has wantonly wasted her life--clearly a bad thing. Comment on the place of such\narguments in the book. Why is Raskolnikov so eager to taunt Sonia in this way?\n17. Much of Crime and Punishment turns on questions of humiliating others by humiliating oneself. (It is\nin this context that Raskolnikov regards Dounia's attempt to sacrifice her life for his benefit-by marrying\nLuzhin-as an insult. He feels no particular gratitude or guilt, unlike Eugene in Pere Goriot. Rather, his\nthought is that she has humiliated him by not seeing that he is a \"great man\" and doesn't need her help.\n\"These delicate creatures,\" he thinks. \"They love as though they hate.\") Comment on this facet of the\nnovel.\n18. The point of Tolstoy's epigraph in relation to the text: \"Vengeance is mine saith the Lord; I will\nrepay.\" Does this mean that Anna deserves what happens to her? That she deserves the fate that\novertakes her and is justly to be condemned (in Tolstoy's view) by God's retributive justice? Or that it is\nnot for human beings to imagine that they can understand the viewpoint of God and that it is beyond our\npower to endorse Anna's suffering as fit punishment for her actions?\n19. Suicide (or the sacrifice of one's life) as emblematic of the themes of the book any text read during\nthe second half of the term.\n20. Levin and Charles Bovary: the man who knows how to love.\n21. Compare and contrast any two texts read this term in respect of one of the following themes: Books\nand Life; Vocation (especially good in comparing Levin, who discovers his vocation, and the dilettante\naristocrats, like Vronsky, who are still looking for one at the end of the book); Duty to oneself and duty to\nothers; Ambition; Boredom; Outsiders; The Decisive Event and its Consequences; The Historical\nMoment; Hypocrisy; Playing the Game; The Importance of Family.\n22. Take at least three passages from any novel and analyze them, showing why they are symptomatic of\nthe concerns of the text as a whole. (The paper length should calculated without including the space\noccupied by extensive quotation of passages from the novel.)\n23. Most novels of any length make use of contrasting passages in depicting characters or reinforcing the\nnarrative's view of their lives and fortunes. Anna Karenina is particularly rich in such passages, which\ninvite (one might argue) comparison by way of contrast with other passages much earlier or later in the\nbook. We might mention three pairs, each member of which is separated from its \"mate\" by a good\nstretch of the book--Vronsky losing the race, Levin mowing with the peasants; Levin's night of\nhappiness, just after Kitty has accepted him, and Anna's final journey, in which everyone she sees looks\nodious in one way or another; Vronsky's \"lessive\" and the rules he follows in drawing up his ethical\naccounts and Levin's final meditation on the rules that will guide him, as he supposes, during the\nremainder of his life. Discuss how these or any other such contrasts illuminate the presiding themes of the\nbook.\n\n24. The novelist as moralist. Does a particular text represent an ethical view from which perspective the\nconduct and character of its protagonists can be judged? Or does it assume or imply such a view? Is this\nview exhibited in the novel's assignment of fates or outcomes or fortunes to its major figures? Or is it\nmore subtly indicated by the ways in which the narrative reveals their inner lives?\n25. The protagonist as tragic figures. (Please--no mechanical--i.e., unargued--definitions of \"tragic\nfigure\". Do not cite any dictionary definition and forget about Aristotle's definition [if you know it]\nunless you can defend it.)\n26. We distinguished (roughly) three aspects of the notion of \"point of view\" in a novel. (1) A character\nmay serve at a particular moment or even for the whole book as a focus of information, so that the\nnarrative voice knows only what he or she is capable of knowing or observing. (2) A character may serve\nas a register of judgment or interpretation of the significance of particular events, so that the text is bound\n(perhaps for the moment only) to the character's viewpoint of what something means in respect of its\ngeneral importance to the interests and fortune's of anyone or everyone in the story, including the\ncharacter in question, or expresses a momentary judgment on the character's situation in life. It is in this\nregard that the novel's narrative admits exclamation points, when appropriate, as when Emma Bovary\ncontemplates the passage of time: \"How long ago it seemed!\" (This function has recently entered\nordinary conversational styles, as we observed, with the introduction of the phrase, \" . . . and I was\nlike . . .\". (3) Finally, there are both momentary and large-scale judgments of an ethical kind, which\ncharacters may or may not share with the narrative voice (and we may or may not as well). Closely\nexamine two or three passages in either Crime and Punishment or Anna Karenina to show how \"point of\nview\" operates and how it relates to the general concerns of the text. (To illustrate with a minor example:\nWhen Vronsky leaves the Scherbatsky household just after Levin's failed proposal of marriage, he thinks\nof Kitty's purity and freshness and the text says that his feelings about this arose \"partly from the fact that\nhe had not been smoking for a whole evening.\" This is clearly not Vronsky's point of view.)\n27. Anna and Emma as tragic heroines."

Please put your name, the title of your essay, and the character-\ncount on a title page. (Any reasonable word-processing program will give you a character-count.)\nPLEASE NUMBER THE PAGES and START WITH THE FIRST PAGE AFTER THE TITLE PAGE.\nThe following topics are meant to be suggestive--the starting-point for thinking through an\nessay. Please remember that you are not writing a book-report but an essay, which must have an\nargument, a point to make about the book(s) covered. In consequence of observing this distinction, it\nfollows that you should not give an outline of the plot or description of incidents and characters unless (a)\nit is directly relevant to a point that you are making about the book and (b) you are reminding your reader\nof the evidence for your argument. In other words, you should assume that the reader of your essay has\nread the book and already knows what is in it. Finally, the point of your argument should not be so\nobvious that no argument against it can be imagined; you shouldn't be arguing a thesis for which no\nsensible alternative exists.\nTo elaborate slightly: (1) An essay has a thesis (e.g., the \"real\" hero of Pere Goriot is Vautrin);\n(2) your choice of thesis implies a puzzle that you are resolving (e.g., the title of the book suggests that\nGoriot is the protagonist of the book); (3) your thesis should have in mind the possibility of some\nalternative view of the matter (Rastignanc is the hero) which is sensible.\nThese introductory remarks are not meant to provide you with the form of an outline for an essay\nbut with the background assumptions that will keep your essay from sounding like a ramble among\nunassimilated details or a rehearsal of the obvious (or what is worst of all, a sermon: e.g., Vautrin is a bad\nperson and we should all dislike him). You are making a case for a view (an interpretation) of some\naspect of a text.\nSuggested Themes and Topics\nThe famous novelist, Thomas Mann, in an essay on Don Quixote, expressed astonishment at the\npresence of the so-called \"interpolated\" story of Lucinda, Dorothea, Don Fernando, and Cardenio in the\nbook. The book mocks the unrealities of tales of knight errantry, Mann complained, and yet it presents a\nstory of misguided or thwarted love written in a similarly unrealistic style. We have not read any \"books\nof knight-errantry\" (although Cervantes provides a plot summary or general outline for the genre) but we\nmust suppose that while both the books of knight-errantry and the Lucinda-through-Cardenio episode are\n\"unrealistic\" from a twentieth-century viewpoint, in the view of Cervantes and his contemporaries they\nwere not unrealistic in the same way. The point about good literature, for Cervantes, was not that it\nshould be realistic but that it should be \"truthful\"--meaning by this that it should responsibly illustrate\ngeneral truths about human relationships and do so in an ingenious way. (The point is made occasionally\nin the text and most strikingly in the passages that we have read by the canon who falls his with Don\nQuixote and his friends on their final journey home.) Comment.\nDon Quixote is a reader of bad literature--he is also a bad reader of literature. Do the two\ncharacteristics go together? Does bad literature injure your sense of reality? Is the book adequate to this\ntheme? Alternatively, drawing upon specific episodes, examine some of the ways in which Don Quixote\nis a bad reader and show how this moves him to act in comic or foolish ways.\nDiscuss the relation between Don Quixote and Sancho in any way that seems interesting. In his\nfirst venture in search of adventure, Don Quixote has only Rocinante as a companion. There are those\nwho say that Sancho was an after-thought, while others argue that Cervantes must have had him in mind\n-1\n\nfrom the start. Which of these views do you favor? What does the presence of Sancho add to the\nmeaning of the book? Is Sancho essential to its conception? Is he more sensible than Don Quixote, less\nsensible, closer to reality or equally mad but in a different way?\nWe may quote Thomas Mann once again. \"Don Quixote is of course a simpleton. But his\nobsolete whimsy is also the source of such true nobility, such purity of life, such winning and respect-\ncompelling traits, that our laughter over his grotexque and doleful countenance is always mingled with\namazed respect.\" As a comic figure, Don Quixote is obliged to suffer innumerable indignities in the\nbook. Yet subsequent generations of readers have found in him admirable qualities that survive this\ntreatment--perhaps despite his author's intention--and regarded him as something more than just a figure\nof fun. Were they right or wrong and why? Is there something about Don Quixote's ambition, mad\nthough it is, that nonetheless makes him superior to all the indignities that the book heaps upon him?\nDiscuss in connection with one or two episodes in the text-for example, the episode of the fulling-mills or\nthe episode of freeing the convicts.\nThe parts of Cervantes's novel that deal with the adventures of the knight and his squire are full of\ntricks that would mock any reader proposing to take the story seriously. By means of a number of\nnarrative devices (the chapter headings, for example, or the suspension of narrative in mid-combat, when\nthe author complains that his historical sources have run out) and other gimmicks, one is constantly\nreminded that--whatever the overall purpose of book--one is reading a narrative entertainment, not the\nsort of narrative that the canon or the curate would approve of as a serious or responsible work of\nliterature. Discuss some of these tricks or jokes and their effect upon the reader.\n\"He [Eugene] had seen the three attitudes of men toward the world: obedience, struggle, and\nrevolt; the family, society, and Vautrin. He dared not choose among them.\" Explicate this passage from\nPere Goriot. Why dare Eugene not choose among them?\nThe first American translation of Pere Goriot ended at the words \"Seeing him thus, Christophe\nslipped away\" (on p. 275 of your text) and then added the following: \"The reader may believe that Eugene\nreturned to the Maison Vauquer thoroughly cured of his fancy for Parisian high-life and female\npatronage, and that in due time he married Victorine and took up his abode in the provinces.\" Comment.\nDiscuss the ethical issues raised by \"the problem of the mandarin\" in Pere Goriot in relation to\nthe plot.\nThe Marquis d'Ajuda-Pinto is about to marry Mlle de Rochefilde, but Eugene's cousin, Madame\nde Beauseant, only suspects this, is the last person in the world of fashion to know. When Eugene first\nvisits her, the Marquis makes a slight movement when he hears the footman announce that a third party is\nabout to make an appearance, and Madame de Beauseant guesses at the truth. \"And so it must be\nrecorded that Madame de Beauseant had observed her lover's involuntary movement--slight, but so simple\nas to be frightening\". (p. 71.) Much of the book is concerned with the way in which Eugene learns to\ninterpret such trifles--small gestures, subtle alterations of tones, a second meaning lurking beneath the\napparent meaning of a phrase. Balzac takes it for granted that the reader will understand perfectly why a\ntiny gesture in these particular circumstances may provide evidence for the vicontesse's conclusion. In\npart, the book is a chronicle of a young man's education in the ways of fashionable society, penetrating\nappearances and learning how to conceal his own feelings. (\"Never let anyone suspect your real\nfeelings,\" says the vicontesse to him, \"or you'll be lost.\" [p.82]). Take any instance of subtlety in verbal\nexchange or observation by Eugene and show how it works and what Balzac expects his reader to\nunderstand.\nIn the world of Balzac's Paris, power depends, paradoxically, upon the appearance of having\n-2\n\npower; that is why for those who want power, being mocked by the raised eyebrow of a servant can\nhumiliate so deeply. (You might try explaining, in connection with this notion of the power of\nappearances, both the wit and the appropriateness of Rastignac's remark about his tailor: \"I know two\npairs of his trousers that have made marriages worth twenty thousand francs a year.\" [p. 99.]) In\ncontrast, Don Quixote's power is all delusion, but there is a paradox involved here as well: his delusion is\nsuch that he can never be convinced that he doesn't have any, and so he cannot be humiliated. Comment\non the theme of humiliation or upon the contrast just drawn.\nMme de Beauseant says to Eugene that she will lend him her name, which she asks him not to\ndisgrace, and then he appeals to his mother and daughters for the means to acquire \"the weapons\"\n(suitable clothing and transportation). It sounds a bit like a knight-errant starting out on his career. The\ncomparison becomes explicit when Delphine sets him up in his own apartment. (p. 207) \"Success is\neverything in Paris; it's the key to power.\" What is meant by \"career\" and \"success\" in the context of this\nbook?\nWhy can women be exploited? They crave respectability, while the respectable aristocracy\ncraves money. All is appearance--but only in Paris; the countryside remains a possibility. The passage\non p. 217 that declares this speaks of the \"strength to dominate but how or to what end he did not know\".\nA remarkable idea. Compare Don Quixote with the sentiment that follows: in the absence of a pure love,\npower can be a fine thing in itself if pursued for the glory of country.\nThe mutual courtship of male and female in Balzac's high society is a zero-sum game: there is\nalways a winner and a loser. In the text, women are largely manipulated by men--they are weaker. This\nis a feature of Balzac's fiction--women who can love at all wind up as victims, because sooner or later\ntheir beloved exploits or betrays them. Women are constant in love, men love and then fall out of love-\nthat is the Balzacian general rule. Eugene's story is one version of this. Discuss the role of women of\nfashion in Pere Goriot--the ability to patronize young men such as Eugene, their susceptibility to being\nvictimized by husbands and/or lovers.\nAfter their confrontation in the garden, Eugene thinks of Vautrin: \"That man must have a brain\nof iron! he told me bluntly exactly what Madame de Beauseant told me in polite phrases. He told me\nmore about virtue than I've ever learned from men or books.\" What are the teachings of Vautrin? How\nwould you elucidate his character and the kind of temptation that he represents? Are his views, indeed,\nendorsed by Mme de Beauseant in the speech to which Eugene refers?\nAt one point, Balzac announces the theme of his book as tracing \"the devious ways by which an\nambitious man of the world gets the better of his conscience as he tries to skirt round evil, so as to achieve\nhis aim while preserving appearances . . .\" (pp. 129-30.) Is this the theme? Elucidate.\nVautrin: Virtue is indivisible--hence go all the way to crime. True? Goriot: they are commiting\nall crimes in this one. True?\n-3"

Le style\nindirect libre is a piece of French imported into literary criticism; the English indirect free style is also used,\nbut less often. Like most features of utterance that seem perfectly natural, its function is not easy to\ndescribe. The oppositions involved are:\na.\nfree quotation, in which the words of the speaker are quoted but the speaker is not identified, as\nopposed to tagged quotation, which designates the speaker; for example, the phrase \"You are to go\nhome now\", with its quotation marks, versus the phrase I said \"You are to go home now\", in which the\nquotation marks are within the phrase, which not only quote verbatim but also identifies the speaker.\nb.\ndirect quotation, which encloses the actual words of the speaker in quotation marks, as opposed to\nindirect quotation which may or may not tag the source but which gives the thought rather than the\nactual words of the speaker. Thus I said, \"You are to go home now\" versus I told them that they were\nto go home immediately. Note the two-fold change in tense in the last example-the change in tense\n(from are to were), and also the change from now to immediately. Both of these changes refer to what\nlinguists call deixis. This term designates elements in an utterance that refer to the time and place of\nthe utterance as opposed to elements in the utterance that refer to the time and place of the events that\nthe utterance is about. In the first phrase, the saying occurred in the past and so the verb indicating\nspeech must be in the past tense; the deictic indicator in what is spoken in direct quotation, i.e. the\nnow, points to the time of the quoted speech of which it is a part. In the second phrase the word now\nwould also refer to the time of utterance, but here the time of utterance is not past; what is spoken of\nis in the past but the time of utterance is the present and so now is out of place and must yield to\nimmediately. I told them that they are to go home now is not grammatical.\nThe point about the free indirect style is that violates the rule of grammar appropriate to reporting past\nutterance and does so in a way that we find so natural that it surprises us to learn that it does not appear in\nprint as a regular feature of narrative texts-indeed, it has been argued that it does not appear at all-until the\nend of the eighteenth century. The device is exclusively literary, that is to say, a feature of fiction. It occurs\nneither in first-person narrative, whether fictive or true, nor in historical accounts of the past.\nTo illustrate: suppose that a young in an overworked or depressed state of mind has fled the city for the\ncountryside and sits down to write his beloved a letter about the effect of the scenery on his state of mind.\nIn the examples, the elements in italics are deictics, referring to something contemporary with the moment\nof utterance or in proximity to the spatial position of the writer. Compare:\na.\nStraightforward utterance: \"By the time that you receive this, I will be downhearted once more, but\nfor now I am delighted to be here. How beautiful it is!\" The exclamation point expresses an emotion\ncontemporary with the time of utterance.\nb.\nIndirect utterance: \"I believed that by the time you received the letter, I would be downhearted once\nmore, but at the moment I was nonetheless delighted to be there. I thought the scenery was extremely\nbeautiful.\"The tenses have changed, the \"this\" and \"now\" have been replaced by explicit designations.\nThe phrasing of the exclamation has been altered, and exclamation point has vanished; the upsurge of\nemotion is a sentiment belonging to the past that is described, not to the time of utterance. In the\nexchange the upsurge has been lost; one can think that something is extremely beautiful and yet have\nno emotional response whatever.\nc.\nIndirect free style: \"He sat down to write a letter. By the time that she would receive it, he would be\ndownhearted once more, but his present feelings were unaffected by this thought. How beautiful it\nwas!\" The exclamation is not quoted; it is not tagged. The sentence belong to the narrative voice; the\nyoung man would not say How beautiful it was but rather How beautiful it is. And yet the reader\nknows that it registers a sense of things that belongs to the person written about, not to the narrative\nvoice. The words belong to one, the response to the other.\nFlaubert, Madame Bovary\n\n21L472\n\nMAJOR EUROPEAN NOVELS\nProfessor Kibel\n\nReading Study and Discussion Questions\nAlthough there is no play with exclamation points, there are some instances of the indirect free style in\nBalzac and many more in Stendhal. It is a major element in Flaubert. The indirect free style, so to speak,\nseals the bond between the narrative voice of the text and the character that is chosen as a source of\ninformation without identifying them, as first-person narration would do. One can easily see that it has no\nplace whatsoever in Don Quixote.\n1.\nFind examples of the free indirect style: most involve Emma but some involve other characters,\nparticularly Rodolphe. How clear is the distinction between the sentiments or the perceptions, which\nbelong to the characters, and choice of phrases, which belong to the narrative? What is implied about\nthe characters by the ability to make this distinction?\n2.\nIn his letters, Flaubert described Madame Bovary as \"a book about nothing\". He described his prose\nas trying to fulfill the ambition to be \"as transparent as a plane of glass\". He argued that art should be\n\"pure\"- unalloyed by ethical judgment-and he wrote of his wish to ally art with science rather than\nwith moral judgment. Elaborate on these three notions. What do they mean? Are they connected in\nsome way? Does the novel exhibit them?\n3.\nWe are told at one point in the text that Emma, virtually throughout her years of maturity, has been\n\"waiting for something to happen\". Yet much happens-she falls in love, she marries, she has a child,\nshe falls in love again, then again, and this time has an adulterous affair, she nearly commits suicide,\nand so on. What does it mean to say that she is \"waiting for something to happen.\" It is generally the\ninitial response of readers that nothing seems to happen in the book (until the end). Does this put them\non a level with Emma, so far as their understanding of events in the book is concerned?\n4.\nWe have discussed the notion that characters in a text are defined in some manner relative to the\nworld that the text presents and to the problems that circumstances within this world may pose for\ncharacters within it. In this connection, we asked whether certain characters were superior, equal or\ninferior to other characters in the text or (more importantly) to the implied reader of the text in respect\nof certain qualities. Discuss any aspect of the issue of ranking characters with respect to qualities by\ncentering discussion on any four of the characters in Madame Bovary.\n5.\nEmma has been described as a trivial person-the equivalent of a housewife in the hinterlands of rural\nAmerica who stuffs her imagination with television dramas and runs away to the big city to realize\nher fantasies about love and romance. Is this account adequate to her presence in the novel? Again,\nEmma has been described as \"a female Don Quixote\". How just is this comparison?\n6.\nAt one point the novel says that Emma \"was incapable of . . . recognizing anything that wasn't\nexpressed in conventional terms\" (p. 51.) and of Rodolphe, much later in the novel (p. 224) that he\ncan't recognize the uniqueness or genuineness of feeling that might underlie conventional similarities\nof expression. Does this make them alike or different?\n7.\nAlmost all of the characters in Madame Bovary think and feel in conventional ways. The text is\nsuffused with conventionalities of various sorts--conventionalities of religion (the Abbe Bournisien),\nof science (Homais), of politics (the speaker at the county fair), of art and literature (Emma, Leon,\nRodolphe). In an important sense, even Emma's notion of unconventionality is a conventional notion;\nand the idea of conventionality needs some exploring to resolve this paradox.\n8.\nBy use of le style indirect libre Flaubert contrasts the viewpoints of two characters from time to time\nin the novel. Explore the contrasting viewpoints upon an episode in the book of Charles and Emma,\nof Rodolphe and Emma, of Lestibudois and Justin, of the Abbe Bournisien and Emma.\n9.\nThe test is full of images of realized ambition-images of the sort of realization that Emma never\nexperiences. And these images are all images of grotesque hodge-podges: among them, Charles's\nschool-cap, Emma's wedding cake, the cathedral steeple at Rouen, the festival platter at Vaubeyessard,\nFlaubert, Madame Bovary\n\n21L472\n\nMAJOR EUROPEAN NOVELS\nProfessor Kibel\n\nReading Study and Discussion Questions\nthe cast made for the cripple's leg, the tombstone Charles plans for Emma.

They\nshould consist of approximately six double-spaced pages (i.e., in the neighborhood of 11,900\ncharacters or 2,400 words). Put the count under your name on the title page and number the\npages. Do not number the title-page but start the count with the first page of your essay. If\nthe numbers swallow up space beyond the usual one-inch margins, keep the word-count in mind.\nI repeat my introductory remarks to the first assignment: The following topics are meant\nto be suggestive-the starting-point for thinking through an essay. Please remember that you are\nnot writing a book-report but an essay, which must have an argument, a point to make about the\nbook(s) covered. In consequence of observing this distinction, it follows that you should not\ngive an outline of the plot or descriptions of incidents and characters unless (a) they are directly\nrelevant to a point that you are making about the book and (b) you are reminding your reader of\nthe evidence that they supply. In other words, you should assume that the reader of your essay\nhas read the book and already knows what is in it. Finally, the point of your argument should\nnot be so obvious that no argument against it can be imagined; you shouldn't be arguing a thesis\nfor which no sensible alternative exists.\nTo elaborate slightly: (1) An essay has a thesis (e.g., the \"real\" hero of Pere Goriot is\nVautrin); (2) your choice of thesis implies a puzzle that you are resolving (e.g., the title of the\nbook suggests that Goriot is the protagonist of the book); (3) your thesis should have in mind the\npossibility of some alternative view of the matter (Rastignanc is the hero) which is sensible.\nThese introductory remarks are not meant to provide you with the form of an outline for\nan essay but with the background assumptions that will keep your essay from sounding like a\nramble among unassimilated details or a rehearsal of the obvious (or what is worst of all, a\nsermon: e.g., Vautrin is a bad person and we should all dislike him). You are making a case for\na view (an interpretation) of a text.\nSuggested Themes and Topics\nWe have discussed the notion that characters in a text are defined in some manner\nrelative to the world that the text presents and to the problems that circumstances within this\nworld may pose for characters within it. In this connection, we asked whether certain characters\nwere superior, equal or inferior to other characters in the text or (more importantly) to the\nimplied reader of the text in respect of certain qualities. To elaborate: Characters in novels\ncannot be immediately related to readers in point of some notion of potential for acting in an\nadmirable way (admirable in any sense, not just in an ethical sense). The reader cannot always\nsay, \"How inferior! I'm more clever or more honest or more brave than that.\" The introductory\nparagraphs of Pere Goriot might be taken as warning the reader not to assume his or her\nsuperiority to the characters. The implication here is that the reader either doesn't know as much\nas the author about the depths of life or else is already too jaded by the pressures of success to\nappreciate these depths. The novel, however, knows better and the reader should not suppose\nthat the reader is entitled to believe himself or herself superior to one character because he is a\n-1\n\nfool with regard to his children or to another because he learns to get the better of his conscience.\nDiscuss any aspect of the issue of ranking characters with respect to qualities by\ncentering discussion on any one or two of the characters from either The Red and the Black or\nMadame Bovary. For example, Emma Bovary has been described as a trivial person-the\nequivalent of a housewife in the hinterlands of rural America who stuffs her imagination with\ntelevision dramas and runs away to the big city to realize her fantasies about love and romance.\nIs this account adequate to her presence in the novel?\nCharacters in books do not (usually) compare themselves or others in point of superiority,\nequality or inferiority with the readers, but they do compare themselves with each other.\nExamine any character from either The Red and the Black or Madame Bovary in respect of the\njudgements they make in this regard and draw some conclusions about the view that the text\ntakes of them as they judge others.\nA complex version of this issue: In some ways, Emma, provincial housewife that she is,\nshares some features with Mathilde de la Mole. At the same time, Mathilde shares some features\nwith Julien. (For example: in her first sexual experience, she is conscious of doing her duty [p.\n344.] and therefore does not enjoy the experience.) Comment on either of these comparisons in\nways relevant to the themes of one or both novels.\nAt one point the novel says that Emma \"was incapable of . . . recognizing anything that\nwasn't expressed in conventional terms\" (p. 51.) and of Rodolphe, much later in the novel (p.\n224.) that he can't recognize the uniqueness or genuineness of feeling that might underlie\nconventional similarities of expression. Does this make them alike or different?\nEmma in her affair with Rodolphe is controlled by him; he is the dominant figure, to the\npoint where \"he made her into something compliant, something corrupt. (p. 224.) Leon in his\naffair with Emma is controlled by her; she is the dominant and rather frightening figure. Are\nthese relations transitive? that is to ask, is Emma placed between the two men in point of\nstrength of character?\nMinor characters in The Red and the Black (Julien's father, M. Valenod, the Abbe de\nFrilair) and minor characters in Madame Bovary (Homais, for example, or even Charles, who is\nsupremely happy with Emma) know what they want and how to get it. Does this make them\nsuperior to the main characters (Julien, Emma)?\nStendhal writes of Julien at one point in the book (p. 327): \"He was the unhappy man at\nwar with all society.\" What is meant by this phrase? At the end of Pere Goriot, Eugene would\nseem to declare war on society--the high society in Paris. Compare the two in respect of this\nnotion. An important feature of the comparison: Julien is so sensitive to insult that he sees it\nwhere it doesn't exist and is willing to risk his career, such as it is, in answering a provocation\n(he wants to fight a duel with Amanda Binet's lover just before entering the seminary, risking his\nseminary career; he decides to seduce Mathilde, imperiling his career as the Marquis's\nsecretary). Would Eugene do such things? Eugene worries about his conscience. Does Julien?\n-2\n\nDiscuss role-playing in any manner that seems important to understanding The Red and\nthe Black. In this context, pay particular attention to the notion of hypocrisy and to the goings-\non in the chapter entitled \"An attack of gout\".\nDiscuss the idea of \"point of view\" and the uses of point of view in a way that illuminates\nthe central concerns of any text read so far this term.\nDiscuss the notion of boredom and its central role in either The Red and the Black or\nMadame Bovary.\nThe notion of \"duty\" to one's career is central to The Red and the Black in a way that it is\nnot to Pere Goriot or to Madame Bovary. There is, perhaps, an arguable connection with Don\nQuixote. Discuss.\nThree versions of one topic: (1.) Emma Bovary has been called \"The Female Quixote.\"\nDiscuss. (2.) Compare Julien Sorel or Emma Bovary with Don Quixote, as a character who gets\nan idea of \"what is owing to oneself\" from books. (3.) Don Quixote speaks of \"imitation\"-\nimitating idealized examples of conduct found in important narratives (whether historical or\nfictional) or imitating the best works of literature by writing works similar in kind. Neglecting\nthe latter, we still speak of the former, but we use the term \"role-model\". Discuss the function of\nrole-models in either R&B or MB.\n\"Deep down, all the while, she was waiting for something to happen. . . . Other people's\nlives, drab though they might be, held at least the possibility of an event. One unexpected\nhappening often set in motion a whole chain of change: the entire setting of one's life could be\ntransformed. But to her nothing happened.\" (Madame Bovary, pp 72-3.) It has been said that\nEmma Bovary would not enjoy reading a book like Madame Bovary for Madame Bovary is a\nbook in which, for great stretches of prose, nothing happens. (Indeed, Emma tells Leon that she\nprefers exciting, event-packed romantic novels to poetry.) Comment.\nTake any passage from The Red and the Black or Madame Bovary and analyze it,\nshowing how its issues and themes are characteristic of the book as a whole.\nAt the end of The Red and the Black, Julien is happy in prison (where ambition has no\nplace), disregards Mathilde (who has sacrificed everything for him and is soon to bear his child),\nand occupies himself by making love with Mme de Renal and preparing himself to meet the day\nof his execution Is this an appropriate end to the book?\nCompare Julien's two love-affairs in any way that bears upon what you take to be the\nconcerns or main themes of the text. Compare his two love-partners. Alternatively, discuss the\ndifferences between Charles, Rodolphe, Leon, all of whom Flaubert, in his private\ncorrespondence, called \"mediocrities\" and worried about how well he would enable the reader to\ndistinguish them from one another in their mediocrity. Compare and contrast them. Is there any\ndevelopment in her passage from Charles to Rodolphe to Leon or is it just movement and\nrepetition-from expectation to disappointment?\n-3\n\nThroughout The Red and the Black, we often know more than Julien, who repeatedly\nmisunderstands what is going on around him. Does this detract from his stature as the hero of\nthe book (assuming that the book has a hero)?\n\"I was improvising for the first time in my life\", says Julien of his speech to the\nBesancon jury. What is the significance of this observation in relation to Julien's sense of his\ncareer, his importance, his duty? The Abbe de Frilair regards Julien's speech as a form of\nsuicide. Is he right?\nCompare Julien and Eugene as the type of ambitious young man from the provinces, on\nthe make in a great metropolis.\nDiscuss the idea of heroism in any text read so far this term. (Don't ask me what I mean\nby \"heroism\"? or do I mean the hero of a book or heroics in life? Resolving ambiguities is your\njob.)\n-4"

What does \"success\" mean to each of them? What sense does each have of\na vocation or a sense of purpose in life? Is it possible to imagine them meeting? Who would be more\nadept at describing this meeting, Balzac or Stendhal?\n2.\nThe uncertain nature of Julien's goal leads him to entertain a sense of duty that does not derive its\ncontent from the requirements of the goal; and so he often tests his capacity to follow the dictates of\nduty abtractly, that is, in circumstances where a sense of duty may not exist. Examine three cases\nfrom the early parts of the book and comment on how they reveal Julien's character.\n3.\nJulien stands in contrast to people like Count Norbert in the book. They know their duty; it is tied\nto honor, which comes with birth and station. The book makes Julien more interesting than they (by\nhaving the admirable or interesting people in the book interested in him), but there is something a bit\nsilly about him. Compare him in this respect with the figure of Don Quixote.\n4.\nJulien acts at moments to propel what he thinks of as his career by saying to himself that he has a\n\"duty to himself\"? How does one acquire a duty? Is it possible to have \"duties to oneself\" as well as\nduties to others? What does Julien mean by the phrase \"duty to himself\"? If there is such a thing as\nduties to oneself, does Julien embody a valid idea of it?\n5.\nStendhal writes of Julien at the point when Julien is about to seduce the daughter of his friend and\nbenefactor: \"He was the unhappy man at war with all society.\" What is meant by this phrase? Can it\npossibly justify what Julien is doing? At the end of Pere Goriot, Eugene would seem to declare war\non society--the high society in Paris. Compare the two in respect of this notion.\n6.\nMinor characters in The Red and the Black (Julien's father, M. Valenod, the Abbe de Frilair) know\nwhat they want and how to get it. Does Julien know what he wants? If not, does this make him\nsuperior or inferior to other characters in respect of the capacity to succeed? Does this make him\nethically superior or inferior? Does it make him more or less interesting than they?\n7.\nKnowing what you want can be a source of weakness, simply because it opens the possibility of\nothers discovering what you want and using their knowledge to manipulate you. At the outset of the\nstory's action, old Sorel gets a good deal out of M. de Renal in bargaining for Julien's salary. What\ndoes M. de Renal want from Julien's employment and how does old Sorel learn what that it and use\nthe knowledge to advantage?\n8.\nJulien imagines that the world is governed by vast conspiracies. Throughout the book, he imagines\nthat people are secretly mocking him, judging him, conspiring against him. Is he correct in this? If so,\ndoes he understand the nature of the conspiracies appropriately?\n9.\nDoes the narrative voice of this text share Julien's sense that conspiracy is everywhere? Does it\nshare Julien's understanding of the nature of these conspiracies? Consider, in this connection, the\nceremonies surrounding the visit of the young Bishop of Agde to the town of Verrieres.\n10.\nConsider Julien's changing responses to the offer made by his friend, Fouque, to put him in the\nway of riches.

The phrase is sometimes taken to mean that the narrative voice knows\neverything, with the implication that it can know what is going on in the minds of his characters, a capacity\ndenied to us with respect to our fellows in life. The idea of the omniscient narrative is better understood,\nhowever, in connection with the notion of the style indirect libre. As we have seen, the narrative voice can\nassociate itself with the emotions, perceptions and thoughts of a character without adopting the first-\npersonal \"I\" it can confine itself for the duration of a scene or an episode to the information that would be\navailable to one character alone, creating the illusion that everything is \"seen\" from that character's\n\"viewpoint\", even though the account of it is not expressed in phrases that the character might have chosen.\nOr it may choose to confine itself only for some part of an episode to the information available to one\ncharacter and for the rest provide information available to no character.\nA good example is provided by a scene that bridges chapters xiii and xiv in Book One of the novel. Levin\nhas come to St. Petersburg to propose to Kitty, who senses this and dreads the moment, for she has become\ninfatuated with Vronsky. At last the moment arrives; Levin has come early to a dinner-party, expressly to\ncatch Kitty alone and propose to her. In a few, brief paragraphs, we move back and forth repeatedly, from\nthe viewpoint of one to the other. Levin proposes, Kitty refuses. At that moment, Kitty's mother, who\ndislikes Levin and favors Vronksy, comes into the room:\nThere was a look of horror on her face when she saw them alone, and their disturbed faces. Levin bowed to\nher and said nothing. Kitty did not speak or lift her eyes. \"Thank God, she has refused him,\" thought the\nmother, and her face lighted up with the habitual smile with which she greeted her guests on Thursdays.\nShe sat down and began questioning Levin about his life in the country.\nThe look of horror can be seen only by Levin, but since Levin has just averted his gaze from Kitty, the fact\nthat his face and Kitty's are disturbed must be the perception of the mother. We have moved to her\nviewpoint, but are moved out of it midway in the third sentence on by the description of the mother's smile:\n\"the habitual smile with which she greeted her guests on Thursdays\". Levin would see the smile but would\nnot know that it was her Thursdays smile. We have moved to the omniscient narrative voice, who knows\nthat the mother has a distinctive smile for each social evening, presumably determined by the sorts of\npeople that she invites to each soiree, as fit company for each other. An entire categorization of social\ndistinctions is involved in that smile, and an immense judgement upon the triviality of those, like the\nmother, who make them-distinctions which lie behind the mother's sense that Vronsky is a superior choice\nfor a husband and that the loss of happiness to Levin and Kitty involved in Kitty's refusal is something to\nbe grateful for.\nTolstoy has mastered to perfection the knack of moving from the viewpoint of one character to another in a\nsingle episode, encompassing the viewpoints of several at a time, all the while admitting information\navailable to none of them. The apparent seamlessness of these transitions creates the impression that we see\neverything that the characters see and more; we penetrate the depth of their souls as far as they do, and\nfurther. Paradoxically, the technique allows Tolstoy to create the impression that the characters see very far\ninto their souls themselves, that they have depths that they are capable of plumbing, and that when they fail\nto see as much as we do, they have knowingly shied away from properly knowing themselves. Tolstoy\nprovides an explicit instance of someone who shies at knowing himself in the character of Sviazhsky,\nintroduced about half-way through the book. Sviaszhsky is a minor character, of no particular importance\nto the plot; he seems deliberately introduced to provide a pure instance of a general condition, a character\nsummed up simply by the fact that he shies at knowing himself. The sharpness of Tolstoy's\ncharacterizations-the sense felt across the literate world that his novels seem to transcribe life itself-has\nmuch to do with the extent to which the narrative voice locates the point where characters in the fiction\ncease to be as aware of what the narrative sees as the narrative is itself; each character of importance to the\nplot will fail at points or in ways particular to the character in question, distinctive from the failure of the\nothers. The character receives its distinction from the others largely by this means-not, as in the works of\nother novelists, by quirks of speech or by description of conduct or surface features.\nTolstoy, Anna Karenina\n\n21L472\n\nMAJOR EUROPEAN NOVELS\nProfessor Kibel\n\nReading Study and Discussion Questions\n1.\nTolstoy affixed an epigraph to the novel: Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord.

Kibel\nVOLUME I. (1605)\nCHAPTER I.\nWHICH TREATS OF THE CHARACTER AND PURSUITS OF THE FAMOUS GENTLEMAN DON\nQUIXOTE OF LA MANCHA\nIn a village of La Mancha, whose name I don't wish to recall, there lived not long since one of those\ngentlemen that keep a lance in the lance-rack, an old buckler, a lean hack, and a greyhound for coursing.\nA stew of rather more beef than mutton, a salad on most nights, scraps on Saturdays, lentils on Fridays,\nand a pigeon or so extra on Sundays, made away with three-quarters of his income. The rest of it went in\na doublet of fine cloth and velvet breeches and shoes to match for holidays, while on week-days he made\na brave figure in his best homespun. He had in his house a housekeeper past forty, a niece under twenty,\nand a lad for the field and market-place, who used to saddle the hack as well as handle the bill-hook. The\nage of this gentleman of ours was bordering on fifty; he was of a hardy habit, spare, gaunt-featured, a\nvery early riser and a great rider to hounds. Some will have it his surname was Quixada or Quesada (for\nhere there is some difference of opinion among the authors who write on the subject), although from\nreasonable conjectures it seems plain that he was called Quexana. This, however, is of but little\nimportance to our tale; it will be enough if we do not to stray a hair's breadth from the truth.\nYou must know, then, that the above-named gentleman whenever he was at leisure (which was mostly all\nthe time) gave himself up to reading books of chivalry with such ardour and avidity that he almost\nentirely neglected the pursuit of his field-sports, and even the management of his property; and to such a\npitch did his eagerness and infatuation go that he sold many an acre of arable land to buy books of\nchivalry to read, and brought home as many of them as he could get. But of all there were none he liked\nso well as those of the famous Feliciano de Silva's composition; for their lucidity of style and\ncomplicated conceits were as pearls in his sight, particularly when in his reading he came upon courtships\nand cartels, where he often found passages like \"the reason of the unreason with which my reason is\nafflicted so weakens my reason that with reason I murmur at your beauty;\" or again, \"the high heavens,\nthat of your divinity divinely fortify you with the stars, render you deserving of the desert your greatness\ndeserves.\" Over conceits of this sort the poor gentleman lost his wits, and used to lie awake striving to\nunderstand them and worm the meaning out of them; what Aristotle himself could not have made out or\nextracted had he come to life again for that special purpose. He was not at all easy about the wounds\nwhich Don Belianis gave and took, because it seemed to him that, great as were the surgeons who had\ncured him, he must have had his face and body covered all over with seams and scars. He commended,\nhowever, the author's way of ending his book with the promise of that interminable adventure, and many\na time was he tempted to take up his pen and finish it properly as is there proposed, which no doubt he\nwould have done, and made a successful piece of work of it too, had not greater and more absorbing\nthoughts prevented him.\nMany an argument did he have with the curate of his village (a learned man, and a graduate of Siguenza)\nas to which had been the better knight, Palmerin of England or Amadis of Gaul. Master Nicholas, the\nvillage barber, however, used to say that neither of them came up to the Knight of Phoebus, and that if\nthere was any that could compare with him it was Don Galaor, the brother of Amadis of Gaul, because he\nhad a spirit that was equal to every occasion, and was no finikin knight, nor lachrymose like his brother,\nwhile in the matter of valour he was not a whit behind him. In short, he became so absorbed in his books\nthat he spent his nights from sunset to sunrise, and his days from dawn to dark, poring over them; and\nwhat with little sleep and much reading his brains got so dry that he lost his wits. His fancy grew full of\n-1\n\nwhat he used to read about in his books, enchantments, quarrels, battles, challenges, wounds, wooings,\nloves, agonies, and all sorts of impossible nonsense; and it so possessed his mind that the whole fabric of\ninvention and fancy he read of was true, that to him no history in the world had more reality in it. He used\nto say the Cid Ruy Diaz was a very good knight, but that he was not to be compared with the Knight of\nthe Burning Sword who with one back-stroke cut in half two fierce and monstrous giants. He thought\nmore of Bernardo del Carpio because at Roncesvalles he slew Roland in spite of enchantments, availing\nhimself of the artifice of Hercules when he strangled Antaeus the son of Terra in his arms. He approved\nhighly of the giant Morgante, because, although of the giant breed which is always arrogant and\nill-conditioned, he alone was affable and well-bred. But above all he admired Reinaldos of Montalban,\nespecially when he saw him sallying forth from his castle and robbing everyone he met, and when beyond\nthe seas he stole that image of Mahomet which, as his history says, was entirely of gold. To have a bout\nof kicking at that traitor of a Ganelon he would have given his housekeeper, and his niece into the\nbargain.\nIn short, his wits being quite gone, he hit upon the strangest notion that ever madman in this world hit\nupon, and that was that he fancied it was right and requisite, as well for the support of his own honour as\nfor the service of his country, that he should make a knight-errant of himself, roaming the world over in\nfull armour and on horseback in quest of adventures, and putting in practice himself all that he had read of\nas being the usual practices of knights-errant; righting every kind of wrong, and exposing himself to peril\nand danger from which, in the issue, he was to reap eternal renown and fame. Already the poor man saw\nhimself crowned by the might of his arm Emperor of Trebizond at least; and so, led away by the intense\nenjoyment he found in these pleasant fancies, he set himself forthwith to put his scheme into execution.\nThe first thing he did was to clean up some armour that had belonged to his great-grandfather, and had\nbeen for ages lying forgotten in a corner eaten with rust and covered with mildew. He scoured and\npolished it as best he could, but he perceived one great defect in it, that it had no closed helmet, nothing\nbut a simple morion. This deficiency, however, his ingenuity supplied, for he contrived a kind of\nhalf-helmet of pasteboard which, fitted on to the morion, looked like a whole one. It is true that, in order\nto see if it was strong and fit to stand a cut, he drew his sword and gave it a couple of slashes, the first of\nwhich undid in an instant what had taken him a week to do. The ease with which he had knocked it to\npieces disconcerted him somewhat, and to guard against that danger he set to work again, fixing bars of\niron on the inside until he was satisfied with its strength; and then, not caring to try any more experiments\nwith it, he passed it and adopted it as a helmet of the most perfect construction.\nHe next proceeded to inspect his hack, which, with more quartos than a real and more blemishes than the\nsteed of Gonela, that \"tantum pellis et ossa fuit,\" surpassed in his eyes the Bucephalus of Alexander or the\nBabieca of the Cid. Four days were spent in thinking what name to give him, because (as he said to\nhimself) it was not right that a horse belonging to a knight so famous, and one with such merits of his\nown, should be without some distinctive name, and he strove to adapt it so as to indicate what he had\nbeen before belonging to a knight-errant, and what he then was; for it was only reasonable that, his master\ntaking a new character, he should take a new name, and that it should be a distinguished and\nfull-sounding one, befitting the new order and calling he was about to follow. And so, after having\ncomposed, struck out, rejected, added to, unmade, and remade a multitude of names out of his memory\nand fancy, he decided upon calling him Rocinante, a name, to his thinking, lofty, sonorous, and\nsignificant of his condition as a hack before he became what he now was, the first and foremost of all the\nhacks in the world.\nHaving got a name for his horse so much to his taste, he was anxious to get one for himself, and he was\neight days more pondering over this point, till at last he made up his mind to call himself \"Don Quixote,\"\nwhence, as has been already said, the authors of this veracious history have inferred that his name must\nhave been beyond a doubt Quixada, and not Quesada as others would have it. Recollecting, however, that\n-2\n\nthe valiant Amadis was not content to call himself curtly Amadis and nothing more, but added the name\nof his kingdom and country to make it famous, and called himself Amadis of Gaul, he, like a good knight,\nresolved to add on the name of his, and to style himself Don Quixote of La Mancha, whereby, he\nconsidered, he described accurately his origin and country, and did honour to it in taking his surname\nfrom it.\nSo then, his armour being furbished, his morion turned into a helmet, his hack christened, and he himself\nconfirmed, he came to the conclusion that nothing more was needed now but to look out for a lady to be\nin love with; for a knight-errant without love was like a tree without leaves or fruit, or a body without a\nsoul. As he said to himself, \"If, for my sins, or by my good fortune, I come across some giant hereabouts,\na common occurrence with knights-errant, and overthrow him in one onslaught, or cleave him asunder to\nthe waist, or, in short, vanquish and subdue him, will it not be well to have some one I may send him to as\na present, that he may come in and fall on his knees before my sweet lady, and in a humble, submissive\nvoice say, 'I am the giant Caraculiambro, lord of the island of Malindrania, vanquished in single combat\nby the never sufficiently extolled knight Don Quixote of La Mancha, who has commanded me to present\nmyself before your Grace, that your Highness dispose of me at your pleasure'?\" Oh, how our good\ngentleman enjoyed the delivery of this speech, especially when he had thought of some one to call his\nLady! There was, so the story goes, in a village near his own a very good-looking farm-girl with whom he\nhad been at one time in love, though, so far as is known, she never knew it nor gave a thought to the\nmatter. Her name was Aldonza Lorenzo, and upon her he thought fit to confer the title of Lady of his\nThoughts; and after some search for a name which should not be out of harmony with her own, and\nshould suggest and indicate that of a princess and great lady, he decided upon calling her Dulcinea del\nToboso--she being of El Toboso--a name, to his mind, musical, uncommon, and significant, like all those\nhe had already bestowed upon himself and the things belonging to him.\nCHAPTER II.\nWHICH TREATS OF THE FIRST SALLY THE INGENIOUS DON QUIXOTE MADE FROM HOME\nThese preliminaries settled, he did not care to put off any longer the execution of his design, urged on to it\nby the thought of all the world was losing by his delay, seeing what wrongs he intended to right,\ngrievances to redress, injustices to repair, abuses to remove, and duties to discharge. So, without giving\nnotice of his intention to anyone, and without anybody seeing him, one morning before the dawning of\nthe day (which was one of the hottest of the month of July) he donned his suit of armour, mounted\nRocinante with his patched-up helmet on, braced his buckler, took his lance, and by the back door of the\nyard sallied forth upon the plain in the highest contentment and satisfaction at seeing with what ease he\nhad begun his grand enterprise. But scarcely did he find himself upon the open plain, when a terrible\nthought struck him, one all but enough to make him abandon the enterprise at the very outset. It occurred\nto him that he had not been dubbed a knight, and that according to the law of chivalry he neither could\nnor ought to bear arms against any knight; and that even if he had been, still he ought, as a novice knight,\nto wear white armour, without a device upon the shield until by his prowess he had earned one. These\nreflections made him waver in his purpose, but his madness being stronger than any reasoning, he made\nup his mind to have himself dubbed a knight by the first one he came across, following the example of\nothers in the same case, as he had read in the books that brought him to this pass. As for white armour, he\nresolved, on the first opportunity, to scour his until it was whiter than an ermine; and so comforting\nhimself he pursued his way, taking that which his horse chose, for in this he believed lay the essence of\nadventures.\nThus setting out, our new-fledged adventurer paced along, talking to himself and saying, \"Who knows but\nthat in time to come, when the veracious history of my famous deeds is made known, the sage who writes\nit, when he has to set forth my first sally in the early morning, will do it after this fashion? 'Scarce had\n-3\n\nthe rubicund Apollo spread o'er the face of the broad spacious earth the golden threads of his bright hair,\nscarce had the little birds of painted plumage attuned their notes to hail with dulcet and mellifluous\nharmony the coming of the rosy Dawn, that, deserting the soft couch of her jealous spouse, was appearing\nto mortals at the gates and balconies of the Manchegan horizon, when the renowned knight Don Quixote\nof La Mancha, quitting the lazy down, mounted his celebrated steed Rocinante and began to traverse the\nancient and famous Campo de Montiel' \" (which indeed he was doing). \"Happy the age, happy the time,\"\nhe continued, \"in which shall be made known my deeds of fame, worthy to be moulded in brass, carved in\nmarble, painted in pictures, for a memorial for ever. And thou, O wise enchanter, whoever thou art, to\nwhom it shall fall to be the chronicler of this wondrous history, forget not, I entreat thee, my good\nRocinante, the constant companion of my ways and wanderings.\" Presently he broke out again, as if he\nwere love-stricken in earnest, \"O Princess Dulcinea, lady of this captive heart, a grievous wrong hast thou\ndone me to drive me forth with scorn, and with inexorable obduracy banish me from the presence of thy\nbeauty. O lady, deign to hold in remembrance this heart, thy slave, that thus in anguish pines for love of\nthee.\"\nSo he went on stringing together these and other absurdities, all in the style of those his books had taught\nhim, imitating their language as well as he could; and all the while he rode so slowly and the sun mounted\nso rapidly and with such fervour that it was enough to melt his brains if he had any. Nearly all day he\ntravelled without anything remarkable happening to him, at which he was in despair, for he was anxious\nto encounter some one at once upon whom to try the strength of his mighty arm.\nWriters there are who say the first adventure he met with was that of Pass of Lapice; others say it was that\nof the windmills; but what I have ascertained on this point and what I have found written in the annals of\nLa Mancha, is that he was on the road all day, and towards nightfall his hack and he found themselves\ndead tired and hungry, when, looking all around to see if he could discover any castle or shepherd's\nshanty where he might refresh himself and relieve his sore wants, he perceived not far out of his road an\ninn, which was as welcome as a star guiding him to the portals, if not the palaces, of his redemption; and\nquickening his pace he reached it just as night was setting in. At the door were standing two young\nwomen, ladies of easy virtue as they call them, on their way to Seville with some mule-drivers who had\nchanced to halt that night at the inn; and as, happen what might to our adventurer, everything he saw or\nimaged seemed to him to be and to happen after the fashion of what he read of, the moment he saw the\ninn he pictured it to himself as a castle with its four turrets and pinnacles of shining silver, not forgetting\nthe drawbridge and moat and all the belongings usually ascribed to castles of the sort. To this inn, which\nto him seemed a castle, he advanced, and at a short distance from it he checked Rocinante, hoping that\nsome dwarf would show himself upon the battlements, and by sound of trumpet give notice that a knight\nwas approaching the castle. But seeing that they were slow about it, and that Rocinante was in a hurry to\nreach the stable, he made for the inn door, and perceived the two gay damsels who were standing there,\nand who seemed to him to be two fair maidens or lovely ladies taking their ease at the castle gate.\nAt this moment it so happened that a swineherd who was going through the stubbles collecting a drove of\npigs gave a blast of his horn to bring them together, and forthwith it seemed to Don Quixote to be what he\nwas expecting, the signal of some dwarf announcing his arrival; and so with prodigious satisfaction he\nrode up to the inn and to the ladies, who, seeing a man of this sort approaching in full armour and with\nlance and buckler, were turning in dismay into the inn, when Don Quixote, guessing their fear by their\nflight, raising his pasteboard visor, disclosed his dry dusty visage, and with courteous bearing and gentle\nvoice addressed them, \"Your ladyships need not fly or fear any rudeness, for that it belongs not to the\norder of knighthood which I profess to offer to anyone, much less to highborn maidens as your\nappearance proclaims you to be.\" The girls were looking at him and straining their eyes to make out the\nfeatures which the clumsy visor obscured, but when they heard themselves called maidens, a thing so\nmuch out of their line, they could not restrain their laughter, which made Don Quixote wax indignant, and\nsay, \"Modesty becomes the fair, and moreover laughter that has little cause is great silliness; this,\n-4\n\nhowever, I say not to pain or anger you, for my desire is none other than to serve you.\"\nThe incomprehensible language and the unpromising looks of our knight only increased the ladies'\nlaughter, and that increased his irritation, and matters might have gone farther if at that moment the\nlandlord had not come out, who, being a very fat man, was also a very peaceful one. He, seeing this\ngrotesque figure clad in armour that did not match any more than his saddle, bridle, lance, buckler, or\ncorselet, was not at all indisposed to join the damsels in their manifestations of amusement; but, in truth,\nstanding in awe of such a complicated armament, he thought it best to speak him fairly, so he said, \"Sir\nKnight, if your worship wants lodging, bating the bed (for there is not one in the inn) there is plenty of\neverything else here.\" Don Quixote, observing the respectful bearing of the Governor of the fortress (for\nso innkeeper and inn seemed in his eyes), made answer, \"Sir Castellan, for me anything will suffice, for\n'My armour is my only wear, My only rest the fray.'\"\nThe host fancied he called him Castellan because he took him for a \"worthy of Castile,\" though he was in\nfact an Andalusian, and one from the strand of San Lucar, as crafty a thief as Cacus and as full of tricks as\na student or a page. \"In that case,\" said he,\n\"'Your bed is on the flinty rock, Your sleep to watch alway,'\nand if so, you may dismount and safely reckon upon any quantity of sleeplessness under this roof for a\nyear, much less for a single night.\" So saying, he went to hold the stirrup for Don Quixote, who got down\nwith great difficulty and exertion (for he had not broken his fast all day), and then charged the host to take\ngreat care of his horse, as he was the best bit of flesh that ever ate bread in this world. The landlord eyed\nhim over but did not find him as good as Don Quixote said, nor even half as good; and putting him up in\nthe stable, he returned to see what might be wanted by his guest, whom the damsels, who had by this time\nmade their peace with him, were now relieving of his armour. They had taken off his breastplate and\nbackpiece, but they neither knew nor saw how to open his gorget or remove his make-shift helmet, for he\nhad fastened it with green ribbons, which, as there was no untying the knots, required to be cut. This,\nhowever, he would not by any means consent to, so he remained all the evening with his helmet on, the\ndrollest and oddest figure that can be imagined; and while they were removing his armour, taking the\nbaggages who were about it for ladies of high degree belonging to the castle, he said to them with great\nsprightliness:\n\"Oh, never, surely, was there knight\nSo served by hand of dame,\nAs served as Don Quixote was\nWhen from his town he came;\nWith maids to serve him with all speed\nAnd also serve his steed-\nor Rocinante, for that, ladies mine, is my horse's name, as Don Quixote of La Mancha is my own; for\nthough I had no intention of declaring myself until my achievements in serving your honour had made me\nknown, the necessity of adapting that old ballad of Lancelot to the present occasion has given you\nknowledge of my name prematurely. A time, however, will come for your ladyships to command and me\nto obey, and then the might of my arm will show my desire to serve you.\"\nThe girls, who were not used to hearing rhetoric of this sort, had nothing to say in reply; they only asked\nhim if he wanted anything to eat. \"I would gladly eat a bit of something,\" said Don Quixote, \"for I feel it\nwould come very seasonably.\" The day happened to be a Friday, and in the whole inn there was nothing\nbut some pieces of the fish they call in Castile \"pollack,\" in Andalusia \"stockfish,\" and in some places\n-5\n\n\"Poor Jack,\" and in others \"troutlet;\" so they asked him if he thought he could eat troutlet, for there was\nno other fish to give him. \"If there be troutlets enough,\" said Don Quixote, \"they will be the same thing as\na trout; for it is all one to me whether I am given eight reals in small change or a piece of eight; moreover,\nit may be that these troutlets are like veal, which is better than beef, or kid, which is better than goat. But\nwhatever it be let it come quickly, for the burden and pressure of arms cannot be borne without support to\nthe inside.\" They laid a table for him at the door of the inn for the sake of the air, and the host brought\nhim a portion of ill-soaked and worse cooked stockfish, and a piece of bread as black and mouldy as his\nown armour; but a laughable sight it was to see him eating, for having his helmet on and the beaver up, he\ncould not with his own hands put anything into his mouth unless some one else placed it there, and this\nservice one of the ladies rendered him. But to give him anything to drink was impossible, or would have\nbeen so had not the landlord bored a reed, and putting one end in his mouth poured the wine into him\nthrough the other; all which he bore with patience rather than sever the ribbons of his helmet.\nWhile this was going on there came up to the inn a sowgelder, who, as he approached, sounded his reed\npipe four or five times, and thereby completely convinced Don Quixote that he was in some famous\ncastle, and that they were regaling him with music, and that the stockfish was trout, the bread the whitest,\nthe wenches ladies, and the landlord the castellan of the castle; and consequently he held that his\nenterprise and sally had been to some purpose. But still it distressed him to think he had not been dubbed\na knight, for it was plain to him he could not lawfully engage in any adventure without receiving the order\nof knighthood.\nCHAPTER III.\nWHEREIN IS RELATED THE DROLL WAY IN WHICH DON QUIXOTE HAD HIMSELF DUBBED\nA KNIGHT\nTormented by this thought, he made haste with his scanty pothouse supper, and having finished it called\nthe landlord, and shutting himself into the stable with him, fell on his knees before him, saying, \"From\nthis spot I rise not, valiant knight, until your courtesy grants me the boon I seek, one that will redound to\nyour praise and the benefit of the human race.\" The landlord, seeing his guest at his feet and hearing a\nspeech of this kind, stood staring at him in bewilderment, not knowing what to do or say, and entreating\nhim to rise, but all to no purpose until he had agreed to grant the boon demanded of him. \"I looked for no\nless, my lord, from your High Magnificence,\" replied Don Quixote, \"and I have to tell you that the boon I\nhave asked and your liberality has granted is that you shall dub me knight to-morrow morning, and that\nto-night I shall watch my arms in the chapel of this your castle; thus tomorrow, as I have said, will be\naccomplished what I so much desire, enabling me lawfully to roam through all the four quarters of the\nworld seeking adventures on behalf of those in distress, as is the duty of chivalry and of knights-errant\nlike myself, whose ambition is directed to such deeds.\"\nThe landlord, who, as has been mentioned, was something of a jokester, and had already some suspicion\nof his guest's want of wits, was quite convinced of it on hearing talk of this kind from him, and to make\nsport for the night he determined to fall in with his humour. So he told him he was quite right in pursuing\nthe object he had in view, and that such a motive was natural and becoming in knights as distinguished as\nhe seemed and his gallant bearing showed him to be; and that he himself in his younger days had\nfollowed the same honourable calling, roaming in quest of adventures in various parts of the world,\namong others the Curing-grounds of Malaga, the Isles of Riaran, the Precinct of Seville, the Little Market\nof Segovia, the Olivera of Valencia, the Rondilla of Granada, the Strand of San Lucar, the Colt of\nCordova, the Taverns of Toledo, and divers other quarters, where he had proved the nimbleness of his\nfeet and the lightness of his fingers, doing many wrongs, cheating many widows, ruining maids and\nswindling minors, and, in short, bringing himself under the notice of almost every tribunal and court of\njustice in Spain; until at last he had retired to this castle of his, where he was living upon his property and\n-6\n\nupon that of others; and where he received all knights-errant of whatever rank or condition they might be,\nall for the great love he bore them and that they might share their substance with him in return for his\nbenevolence. He told him, moreover, that in this castle of his there was no chapel in which he could watch\nhis armour, as it had been pulled down in order to be rebuilt, but that in a case of necessity it might, he\nknew, be watched anywhere, and he might watch it that night in a courtyard of the castle, and in the\nmorning, God willing, the requisite ceremonies might be performed so as to have him dubbed a knight,\nand so thoroughly dubbed that nobody could be more so. He asked if he had any money with him, to\nwhich Don Quixote replied that he had not a farthing, as in the histories of knights-errant he had never\nread of any of them carrying any. On this point the landlord told him he was mistaken; for, though not\nrecorded in the histories, because in the author's opinion there was no need to mention anything so\nobvious and necessary as money and clean shirts, it was not to be supposed therefore that they did not\ncarry them, and he might regard it as certain and established that all knights-errant (about whom there\nwere so many full and unimpeachable books) carried well-furnished purses in case of emergency, and\nlikewise carried shirts and a little box of ointment to cure the wounds they received. For in those plains\nand deserts where they engaged in combat and came out wounded, it was not always that there was some\none to cure them, unless indeed they had for a friend some wise enchanter to succour them at once by\nfetching through the air upon a cloud some damsel or dwarf with a vial of water of such virtue that by\ntasting one drop of it they were cured of their hurts and wounds in an instant and left as sound as if they\nhad not received any damage whatever. But in case this should not occur, the knights of old took care to\nsee that their squires were provided with money and other requisites, such as lint and ointments for\nhealing purposes; and when it happened that knights had no squires (which was rarely and seldom the\ncase) they themselves carried everything in cunning saddle-bags that were hardly seen on the horse's\ncroup, as if it were something else of more importance, because, unless for some such reason, carrying\nsaddle-bags was not very favourably regarded among knights-errant. He therefore advised him (and, as\nhis godson so soon to be, he might even command him) never from that time forth to travel without\nmoney and the usual requirements, and he would find the advantage of them when he least expected it.\nDon Quixote promised to follow his advice scrupulously, and it was arranged forthwith that he should\nwatch his armour in a large yard at one side of the inn; so, collecting it all together, Don Quixote placed it\non a trough that stood by the side of a well, and bracing his buckler on his arm he grasped his lance and\nbegan with a stately air to march up and down in front of the trough, and as he began his march night\nbegan to fall.\nThe landlord told all the people who were in the inn about the madness of his guest, the watching of the\narmour, and the dubbing ceremony he contemplated. Full of wonder at so strange a form of madness, they\nflocked to see it from a distance, and observed with what composure he sometimes paced up and down, or\nsometimes, leaning on his lance, gazed on his armour without taking his eyes off it for ever so long; and\nas the night closed in with a light from the moon so brilliant that it might vie with his that lent it,\neverything the novice knight did was plainly seen by all.\nMeanwhile one of the mule-drivers who were in the inn thought fit to water his team, and it was necessary\nto remove Don Quixote's armour as it lay on the trough; but he seeing the other approach hailed him in a\nloud voice, \"O thou, whoever thou art, rash knight that comest to lay hands on the armour of the most\nvalorous errant that ever girt on sword, have a care what thou dost; touch it not unless thou wouldst lay\ndown thy life as the penalty of thy rashness.\" The mule-driver gave no heed to these words (and he would\nhave done better to heed them if he had been heedful of his health), but seizing it by the straps flung the\narmour some distance from him. Seeing this, Don Quixote raised his eyes to heaven, and fixing his\nthoughts, apparently, upon his lady Dulcinea, exclaimed, \"Aid me, lady mine, in this the first encounter\nthat presents itself to this breast which thou holdest in subjection; let not thy favour and protection fail me\nin this first jeopardy;\" and, with these words and others to the same purpose, dropping his buckler he\nlifted his lance with both hands and with it smote such a blow on the mule-driver's head that he stretched\n-7\n\nhim on the ground, so stunned that had he followed it up with a second there would have been no need of\na surgeon to cure him. This done, he picked up his armour and returned to his beat with the same serenity\nas before.\nShortly after this, another, not knowing what had happened (for the mule-driver still lay senseless), came\nwith the same object of giving water to his mules, and was proceeding to remove the armour in order to\nclear the trough, when Don Quixote, without uttering a word or imploring aid from anyone, once more\ndropped his buckler and once more lifted his lance, and without actually breaking the second mule-\ndriver's head, for he laid it open in four places. At the noise all the people of the inn ran to the spot, and\namong them the landlord. Seeing this, Don Quixote braced his buckler on his arm, and with his hand on\nhis sword exclaimed, \"O Lady of Beauty, strength and support of my faint heart, it is time for thee to turn\nthe eyes of thy greatness on this thy captive knight on the brink of so mighty an adventure.\" By this he\nfelt himself so inspired that he would not have flinched if all the mule-drivers in the world had assailed\nhim. The comrades of the wounded perceiving the plight they were in began from a distance to shower\nstones on Don Quixote, who screened himself as best he could with his buckler, not daring to quit the\ntrough and leave his armour unprotected. The landlord shouted to them to leave him alone, for he had\nalready told them that he was mad, and as a madman he would not be accountable even if he killed them\nall. Still louder shouted Don Quixote, calling them knaves and traitors, and the lord of the castle, who\nallowed knights-errant to be treated in this fashion, a villain and a low-born knight whom, had he received\nthe order of knighthood, he would call to account for his treachery. \"But of you,\" he cried, \"base and vile\nrabble, I make no account; fling, strike, come on, do all ye can against me, ye shall see what the reward of\nyour folly and insolence will be.\" This he uttered with so much spirit and boldness that he filled his\nassailants with a terrible fear, and as much for this reason as at the persuasion of the landlord they left off\nstoning him, and he allowed them to carry off the wounded, and with the same calmness and composure\nas before resumed the watch over his armour.\nBut these freaks of his guest were not much to the liking of the landlord, so he determined to cut matters\nshort and confer upon him at once the unlucky order of knighthood before any further misadventure could\noccur; so, going up to him, he apologised for the rudeness which, without his knowledge, had been\noffered to him by these low people, who, however, had been well punished for their audacity. As he had\nalready told him, he said, there was no chapel in the castle, nor was it needed for what remained to be\ndone, for, as he understood the ceremonial of the order, the whole point of being dubbed a knight lay in\nthe accolade and in the slap on the shoulder, and that could be administered in the middle of a field; and\nthat he had now done all that was needful as to watching the armour, for all requirements were satisfied\nby a watch of two hours only, while he had been more than four about it. Don Quixote believed it all, and\ntold him he stood there ready to obey him, and to make an end of it with as much despatch as possible;\nfor, if he were again attacked, and felt himself to be dubbed knight, he would not, he thought, leave a soul\nalive in the castle, except such as out of respect he might spare at his bidding.\nThus warned and menaced, the castellan forthwith brought out a book in which he used to enter the straw\nand barley he served out to the mule-drivers, and, with a lad carrying a candle-end, and the two damsels\nalready mentioned, he returned to where Don Quixote stood, and bade him kneel down. Then, reading\nfrom his account-book as if he were repeating some devout prayer, in the middle of his delivery he raised\nhis hand and gave him a sturdy blow on the neck, and then, with his own sword, a smart slap on the\nshoulder, all the while muttering between his teeth as if he was saying his prayers. Having done this, he\ndirected one of the ladies to gird on his sword, which she did with great self-possession and gravity, and\nnot a little was required to prevent a burst of laughter at each stage of the ceremony; but what they had\nalready seen of the novice knight's prowess kept their laughter within bounds. On girding him with the\nsword the worthy lady said to him, \"May God make your worship a very fortunate knight, and grant you\nsuccess in battle.\" Don Quixote asked her name in order that he might from that time forward know to\nwhom he was beholden for the favour he had received, as he meant to confer upon her some portion of\n-8\n\nthe honour he acquired by the might of his arm. She answered with great humility that she was called La\nTolosa, and that she was the daughter of a cobbler of Toledo who lived in the stalls of Sanchobienaya,\nand that wherever she might be she would serve and esteem him as her lord. Don Quixote said in reply\nthat she would do him a favour if thenceforward she assumed the \"Don\" and called herself Dona Tolosa.\nShe promised she would, and then the other buckled on his spur, and with her followed almost the same\nconversation as with the lady of the sword. He asked her name, and she said it was La Molinera, and that\nshe was the daughter of a respectable miller of Antequera; and of her likewise Don Quixote requested that\nshe would adopt the \"Don\" and call herself Dona Molinera, making offers to her further services and\nfavours.\nHaving thus, in haste and speed, brought to a conclusion these never-till-now-seen ceremonies, Don\nQuixote was on thorns until he saw himself on horseback sallying forth in quest of adventures; and\nsaddling Rocinante at once he mounted, and embracing his host, as he returned thanks for his kindness in\nknighting him, he addressed him in language so extraordinary that it is impossible to convey an idea of it\nor report it. The landlord, to get him out of the inn, replied with no less rhetoric though with shorter\nwords, and without calling upon him to pay the reckoning let him go with a Godspeed.\nCHAPTER IV.\nOF WHAT HAPPENED TO OUR KNIGHT WHEN HE LEFT THE INN\nDay was dawning when Don Quixote quitted the inn, so happy, so gay, so exhilarated at finding himself\nnow dubbed a knight, that his joy was like to burst his horse-girths. However, recalling the advice of his\nhost as to the requisites he ought to carry with him, especially that referring to money and shirts, he\ndetermined to go home and provide himself with all, and also with a squire, for he reckoned upon\nsecuring a farm-labourer, a neighbour of his, a poor man with a family, but very well qualified for the\noffice of squire to a knight. With this object he turned his horse's head towards his village, and\nRocinante, thus reminded of his old quarters, stepped out so briskly that he hardly seemed to tread the\nearth.\nHe had not gone far, when out of a thicket on his right there seemed to come feeble cries as of some one\nin distress, and the instant he heard them he exclaimed, \"Thanks be to heaven for the favour it accords\nme, that it so soon offers me an opportunity of fulfilling the obligation I have undertaken, and gathering\nthe fruit of my ambition. These cries, no doubt, come from some man or woman in want of help, and\nneeding my aid and protection;\" and wheeling, he turned Rocinante in the direction whence the cries\nseemed to proceed. He had gone but a few paces into the wood, when he saw a mare tied to an oak, and\ntied to another, and stripped from the waist upwards, a youth of about fifteen years of age, from whom the\ncries came. Nor were they without cause, for a lusty farmer was flogging him with a belt and following up\nevery blow with scoldings and commands, repeating, \"Your mouth shut and your eyes open!\" while the\nyouth made answer, \"I won't do it again, master mine; by God's passion I won't do it again, and I'll take\nmore care of the flock another time.\"\nSeeing what was going on, Don Quixote said in an angry voice, \"Discourteous knight, it ill becomes you\nto assail one who cannot defend himself; mount your steed and take your lance\" (for there was a lance\nleaning against the oak to which the mare was tied), \"and I will make you know that you are behaving as\na coward.\" The farmer, seeing before him this figure in full armour brandishing a lance over his head,\ngave himself up for dead, and made answer meekly, \"Sir Knight, this youth that I am chastising is my\nservant, employed by me to watch a flock of sheep that I have hard by, and he is so careless that I lose\none every day, and when I punish him for his carelessness and knavery he says I do it out of\nniggardliness, to escape paying him the wages I owe him, and before God, and on my soul, he lies.\"\n-9\n\n\"Lies before me, base clown!\" said Don Quixote. \"By the sun that shines on us I have a mind to run you\nthrough with this lance. Pay him at once without another word; if not, by the God that rules us I will make\nan end of you, and annihilate you on the spot; release him instantly.\"\nThe farmer hung his head, and without a word untied his servant, of whom Don Quixote asked how much\nhis master owed him.\nHe replied, nine months at seven reals a month. Don Quixote added it up, found that it came to sixty-three\nreals, and told the farmer to pay it down immediately, if he did not want to die for it.\nThe trembling clown replied that as he lived and by the oath he had sworn (though he had not sworn any)\nit was not so much; for there were to be taken into account and deducted three pairs of shoes he had given\nhim, and a real for two blood-lettings when he was sick.\n\"All that is very well,\" said Don Quixote; \"but let the shoes and the blood-lettings stand as a setoff\nagainst the blows you have given him without any cause; for if he spoiled the leather of the shoes you\npaid for, you have damaged that of his body, and if the barber took blood from him when he was sick,\nyou have drawn it when he was sound; so on that score he owes you nothing.\"\n\"The difficulty is, Sir Knight, that I have no money here; let Andres come home with me, and I will pay\nhim all, real by real.\"\n\"I go with him!\" said the youth. \"Nay, God forbid! No, senor, not for the world; for once alone with me,\nhe would ray me like a Saint Bartholomew.\"\n\"He will do nothing of the kind,\" said Don Quixote; \"I have only to command, and he will obey me; and\nas he has sworn to me by the order of knighthood which he has received, I leave him free, and I guarantee\nthe payment.\"\n\"Consider what you are saying, senor,\" said the youth; \"this master of mine is not a knight, nor has he\nreceived any order of knighthood; for he is Juan Haldudo the Rich, of Quintanar.\"\n\"That matters little,\" replied Don Quixote; \"there may be Haldudos knights; moreover, everyone is the\nson of his works.\"\n\"That is true,\" said Andres; \"but this master of mine--of what works is he the son, when he refuses me the\nwages of my sweat and labour?\"\n\"I do not refuse, brother Andres,\" said the farmer, \"be good enough to come along with me, and I swear\nby all the orders of knighthood there are in the world to pay you as I have agreed, real by real, and\nperfumed.\"\n\"For the perfumery I excuse you,\" said Don Quixote; \"give it to him in reals, and I shall be satisfied; and\nsee that you do as you have sworn; if not, by the same oath I swear to come back and hunt you out and\npunish you; and I shall find you though you should lie closer than a lizard. And if you desire to know who\nit is lays this command upon you, that you be more firmly bound to obey it, know that I am the valorous\nDon Quixote of La Mancha, the undoer of wrongs and injustices; and so, God be with you, and keep in\nmind what you have promised and sworn under those penalties that have been already declared to you.\"\nSo saying, he gave Rocinante the spur and was soon out of reach. The farmer followed him with his eyes,\nand when he saw that he had cleared the wood and was no longer in sight, he turned to his boy Andres,\n-10\n\nand said, \"Come here, my son, I want to pay you what I owe you, as that undoer of wrongs has\ncommanded me.\"\n\"My oath on it,\" said Andres, \"your worship will be well advised to obey the command of that good\nknight--may he live a thousand years--for, as he is a valiant and just judge, by Roque, if you do not pay\nme, he will come back and do as he said.\"\n\"My oath on it, too,\" said the farmer; \"but as I have a strong affection for you, I want to add to the debt in\norder to add to the payment;\" and seizing him by the arm, he tied him up again, and gave him such a\nflogging that he left him for dead.\n\"Now, Master Andres,\" said the farmer, \"call on the undoer of wrongs; you will find he won't undo that,\nthough I am not sure that I have quite done with you, for I have a good mind to flay you alive.\" But at last\nhe untied him, and gave him leave to go look for his judge in order to put the sentence pronounced into\nexecution.\nAndres went off rather down in the mouth, swearing he would go to look for the valiant Don Quixote of\nLa Mancha and tell him exactly what had happened, and that all would have to be repaid him sevenfold;\nbut for all that, he went off weeping, while his master stood laughing.\nThus did the valiant Don Quixote right that wrong, and, thoroughly satisfied with what had taken place,\nas he considered he had made a very happy and noble beginning with his knighthood, he took the road\ntowards his village in perfect self-content, saying in a low voice, \"Well mayest thou this day call thyself\nfortunate above all on earth, O Dulcinea del Toboso, fairest of the fair! since it has fallen to thy lot to hold\nsubject and submissive to thy full will and pleasure a knight so renowned as is and will be Don Quixote\nof La Mancha, who, as all the world knows, yesterday received the order of knighthood, and hath to-day\nrighted the greatest wrong and grievance that ever injustice conceived and cruelty perpetrated: who hath\nto-day plucked the rod from the hand of yonder ruthless oppressor so wantonly lashing that tender child.\"\nHe now came to a road branching in four directions, and immediately he was reminded of those\ncross-roads where knights-errant used to stop to consider which road they should take. In imitation of\nthem he halted for a while, and after having deeply considered it, he gave Rocinante his head, submitting\nhis own will to that of his hack, who followed out his first intention, which was to make straight for his\nown stable. After he had gone about two miles Don Quixote perceived a large party of people, who, as\nafterwards appeared, were some Toledo traders, on their way to buy silk at Murcia. There were six of\nthem coming along under their sunshades, with four servants mounted, and three muleteers on foot.\nScarcely had Don Quixote descried them when the fancy possessed him that this must be some new\nadventure; and to help him to imitate as far as he could those passages he had read of in his books, here\nseemed to come one made on purpose, which he resolved to attempt. So with a lofty bearing and\ndetermination he fixed himself firmly in his stirrups, got his lance ready, brought his buckler before his\nbreast, and planting himself in the middle of the road, stood waiting the approach of these knights-errant,\nfor such he now considered and held them to be; and when they had come near enough to see and hear, he\nexclaimed with a haughty gesture, \"All the world stand, unless all the world confess that in all the world\nthere is no maiden fairer than the Empress of La Mancha, the peerless Dulcinea del Toboso.\"\nThe traders halted at the sound of this language and the sight of the strange figure that uttered it, and from\nboth figure and language at once guessed the madness of their owner; they wished, however, to learn\nquietly what was the object of this confession that was demanded of them, and one of them, who was\nrather fond of a joke and was very sharp-witted, said to him, \"Sir Knight, we do not know who this good\nlady is that you speak of; show her to us, for, if she be of such beauty as you suggest, with all our hearts\nand without any pressure we will confess the truth that is on your part required of us.\"\n-11\n\n\"If I were to show her to you,\" replied Don Quixote, \"what merit would you have in confessing a truth so\nmanifest? The essential point is that without seeing her you must believe, confess, affirm, swear, and\ndefend it; else ye have to do with me in battle, ill-conditioned, arrogant rabble that ye are; and come ye\non, one by one as the order of knighthood requires, or all together as is the custom and vile usage of your\nbreed, here do I bide and await you relying on the justice of the cause I maintain.\"\n\"Sir Knight,\" replied the trader, \"I entreat your worship in the name of this present company of princes,\nthat, to save us from charging our consciences with the confession of a thing we have never seen or heard\nof, and one moreover so much to the prejudice of the Empresses and Queens of the Alcarria and\nEstremadura, your worship will be pleased to show us some portrait of this lady, though it be no bigger\nthan a grain of wheat; for by the thread one gets at the ball, and in this way we shall be satisfied and easy,\nand you will be content and pleased; nay, I believe we are already so far agreed with you that even though\nher portrait should show her blind of one eye, and distilling vermilion and sulphur from the other, we\nwould nevertheless, to gratify your worship, say all in her favour that you desire.\"\n\"She distils nothing of the kind, vile rabble,\" said Don Quixote, burning with rage, \"nothing of the kind, I\nsay, only ambergris and civet in cotton; nor is she one-eyed or humpbacked, but straighter than a\nGuadarrama spindle: but ye must pay for the blasphemy ye have uttered against beauty like that of my\nlady.\"\nAnd so saying, he charged with levelled lance against the one who had spoken, with such fury and\nfierceness that, if luck had not contrived that Rocinante should stumble midway and come down, it would\nhave gone hard with the rash trader. Down went Rocinante, and over went his master, rolling along the\nground for some distance; and when he tried to rise he was unable, so encumbered was he with lance,\nbuckler, spurs, helmet, and the weight of his old armour; and all the while he was struggling to get up he\nkept saying, \"Fly not, cowards and caitiffs! stay, for not by my fault, but my horse's, am I stretched here.\"\nOne of the muleteers in attendance, who could not have had much good nature in him, hearing the poor\nprostrate man blustering in this style, was unable to refrain from giving him an answer on his ribs; and\ncoming up to him he seized his lance, and having broken it in pieces, with one of them he began so to\nbelabour our Don Quixote that, notwithstanding and in spite of his armour, he milled him like a measure\nof wheat. His masters called out not to lay on so hard and to leave him alone, but the muleteers blood was\nup, and he did not care to drop the game until he had vented the rest of his wrath, and gathering up the\nremaining fragments of the lance he finished with a discharge upon the unhappy victim, who all through\nthe storm of sticks that rained on him never ceased threatening heaven, and earth, and the brigands, for\nsuch they seemed to him. At last the muleteer was tired, and the traders continued their journey, taking\nwith them matter for talk about the poor fellow who had been cudgelled. He when he found himself alone\nmade another effort to rise; but if he was unable when whole and sound, how was he to rise after having\nbeen thrashed and well-nigh knocked to pieces? And yet he esteemed himself fortunate, as it seemed to\nhim that this was a regular knight-errant's mishap, and entirely, he considered, the fault of his horse.\nHowever, battered in body as he was, to rise was beyond his power.\nCHAPTER V.\nIN WHICH THE NARRATIVE OF OUR KNIGHT'S MISHAP IS CONTINUED\nFinding, then, that, in fact he could not move, he thought himself of having recourse to his usual remedy,\nwhich was to think of some passage in his books, and his madness brought to his mind that about Baldwin\nand the Marquis of Mantua, when Carloto left him wounded on the mountain side, a story known by heart\nby the children, not forgotten by the young men, and lauded and even believed by the old folk; and for all\nthat not a whit truer than the miracles of Mahomet. This seemed to him to fit exactly the case in which he\n-12\n\nfound himself, so, making a show of severe suffering, he began to roll on the ground and with feeble\nbreath repeat the very words which the wounded knight of the wood is said to have uttered:\nWhere art thou, lady mine, that thou\nMy sorrow dost not rue?\nThou canst not know it, lady mine,\nOr else thou art untrue.\nAnd so he went on with the ballad as far as the lines:\nO noble Marquis of Mantua,\nMy Uncle and liege lord!\nAs chance would have it, when he had got to this line there happened to come by a peasant from his own\nvillage, a neighbour of his, who had been with a load of wheat to the mill, and he, seeing the man\nstretched there, came up to him and asked him who he was and what was the matter with him that he\ncomplained so dolefully.\nDon Quixote was firmly persuaded that this was the Marquis of Mantua, his uncle, so the only answer he\nmade was to go on with his ballad, in which he told the tale of his misfortune, and of the loves of the\nEmperor's son and his wife all exactly as the ballad sings it.\nThe peasant stood amazed at hearing such nonsense, and relieving him of the visor, already battered to\npieces by blows, he wiped his face, which was covered with dust, and as soon as he had done so he\nrecognised him and said, \"Senor Quixada\" (for so he appears to have been called when he was in his\nsenses and had not yet changed from a quiet country gentleman into a knight-errant), \"who has brought\nyour worship to this pass?\" But to all questions the other only went on with his ballad.\nSeeing this, the good man removed as well as he could his breastplate and backpiece to see if he had any\nwound, but he could perceive no blood nor any mark whatever. He then contrived to raise him from the\nground, and with no little difficulty hoisted him upon his ass, which seemed to him to be the easiest\nmount for him; and collecting the arms, even to the splinters of the lance, he tied them on Rocinante, and\nleading him by the bridle and the ass by the halter he took the road for the village, very sad to hear what\nabsurd stuff Don Quixote was talking.\nNor was Don Quixote less so, for what with blows and bruises he could not sit upright on the ass, and\nfrom time to time he sent up sighs to heaven, so that once more he drove the peasant to ask what ailed\nhim. And it could have been only the devil himself that put into his head tales to match his own\nadventures, for now, forgetting Baldwin, he bethought himself of the Moor Abindarraez, when the\nGovernor of Antequera, Rodrigo de Narvaez, took him prisoner and carried him away to his castle; so that\nwhen the peasant again asked him how he was and what ailed him, he gave him for reply the same words\nand phrases that the captive Abindarraez gave to Rodrigo de Narvaez, just as he had read the story in the\n\"Diana\" of Jorge de Montemayor where it is written, applying it to his own case so aptly that the peasant\nwent along cursing his fate that he had to listen to such a lot of nonsense; from which, however, he came\nto the conclusion that his neighbour was mad, and so made all haste to reach the village to escape the\nwearisomeness of this harangue of Don Quixote's; who, at the end of it, said, \"Senor Don Rodrigo de\nNarvaez, your worship must know that this fair Xarifa I have mentioned is now the lovely Dulcinea del\nToboso, for whom I have done, am doing, and will do the most famous deeds of chivalry that in this\nworld have been seen, are to be seen, or ever shall be seen.\"\nTo this the peasant answered, \"Senor--sinner that I am!--cannot your worship see that I am not Don\n-13\n\nRodrigo de Narvaez nor the Marquis of Mantua, but Pedro Alonso your neighbour, and that your worship\nis neither Baldwin nor Abindarraez, but the worthy gentleman Senor Quixada?\"\n\"I know who I am,\" replied Don Quixote, \"and I know that I may be not only those I have named, but all\nthe Twelve Peers of France and even all the Nine Worthies, since my achievements surpass all that they\nhave done all together and each of them separately.\"\nWith this talk and more of the same kind they reached the village just as night was beginning to fall, but\nthe peasant waited until it was a little later that the belaboured gentleman might not be seen riding in such\na miserable trim. When it was what seemed to him the proper time he entered the village and went to Don\nQuixote's house, which he found all in confusion, and there were the curate and the village barber, who\nwere great friends of Don Quixote, and his housekeeper was saying to them in a loud voice, \"What does\nyour worship think can have befallen my master, Senor Licentiate Pero Perez?\" for so the curate was\ncalled; \"it is three days now since anything has been seen of him, or the hack, or the buckler, lance, or\narmour. Miserable me! I am certain of it, and it is as true as that I was born to die, that these accursed\nbooks of chivalry he has, and has got into the way of reading so constantly, have upset his reason; for\nnow I remember having often heard him saying to himself that he would turn knight-errant and go all\nover the world in quest of adventures. To the devil and Barabbas with such books, that have brought to\nruin in this way the finest understanding there was in all La Mancha!\"\nThe niece said the same, and, more: \"You must know, Master Nicholas\"--for that was the name of the\nbarber--\"it was often my uncle's way to stay two days and nights together poring over these unholy books\nof misventures, after which he would fling the book away and snatch up his sword and fall to slashing the\nwalls; and when he was tired out he would say he had killed four giants like four towers; and the sweat\nthat flowed from him when he was weary he said was the blood of the wounds he had received in battle;\nand then he would drink a great jug of cold water and become calm and quiet, saying that this water was a\nmost precious potion which the sage Esquife, a great enchanter and friend of his, had brought him. But I\ntake all the blame upon myself for never having told your worships of my uncle's vagaries, that you\nmight put a stop to them before things had come to this pass, and burn all these accursed books--for he\nhas a great number--that richly deserve to be burned like heretics.\"\n\"So say I too,\" said the curate, \"and by my faith to-morrow shall not pass without public judgment upon\nthem, and may they be condemned to the flames lest they lead those that read to behave as my good\nfriend seems to have behaved.\"\nAll this the peasant heard, and from it he understood at last what was the matter with his neighbour, so he\nbegan calling aloud, \"Open, your worships, to Senor Baldwin and to Senor the Marquis of Mantua, who\ncomes badly wounded, and to Senor Abindarraez, the Moor, whom the valiant Rodrigo de Narvaez, the\nGovernor of Antequera, brings captive.\"\nAt these words they all hurried out, and when they recognised their friend, master, and uncle, who had not\nyet dismounted from the ass because he could not, they ran to embrace him.\n\"Hold!\" said he, \"for I am badly wounded through my horse's fault; carry me to bed, and if possible send\nfor the wise Urganda to cure and see to my wounds.\"\n\"See there! plague on it!\" cried the housekeeper at this: \"did not my heart tell the truth as to which foot\nmy master went lame of? To bed with your worship at once, and we will contrive to cure you here\nwithout fetching that Hurgada. A curse I say once more, and a hundred times more, on those books of\nchivalry that have brought your worship to such a pass.\"\n-14\n\nThey carried him to bed at once, and after searching for his wounds could find none, but he said they\nwere all bruises from having had a severe fall with his horse Rocinante when in combat with ten giants,\nthe biggest and the boldest to be found on earth.\n\"So, so!\" said the curate, \"are there giants in the dance? By the sign of the Cross I will burn them\nto-morrow before the day over.\"\nThey put a host of questions to Don Quixote, but his only answer to all was--give him something to eat,\nand leave him to sleep, for that was what he needed most. They did so, and the curate questioned the\npeasant at great length as to how he had found Don Quixote. He told him, and the nonsense he had talked\nwhen found and on the way home, all which made the curate the more eager to do what he did the next\nday, which was to summon his friend the barber, Master Nicholas, and go with him to Don Quixote's\nhouse.\nCHAPTERS VI and VII.\nOF THE DIVERTING AND IMPORTANT SCRUTINY WHICH THE CURATE AND THE BARBER\nMADE IN THE LIBRARY OF OUR INGENIOUS GENTLEMAN AND ALSO OF THE SECOND\nSALLY OF OUR WORTHY KNIGHT DON QUIXOTE OF LA MANCHA\nHe was still sleeping; so the curate asked the niece for the keys of the room where the books, the authors\nof all the mischief, were, and right willingly she gave them. They all went in, the housekeeper with them,\nand found more than a hundred volumes of big books very well bound, and some other small ones. The\nmoment the housekeeper saw them she turned about and ran out of the room, and came back immediately\nwith a saucer of holy water and a sprinkler, saying, \"Here, your worship, senor curate, sprinkle this room;\ndon't leave any enchanter of the many there are in these books to bewitch us in revenge for our design of\nbanishing them from the world.\"\nThe simplicity of the housekeeper made the curate laugh, and he directed the barber to give him the books\none by one to see what they were about, as there might be some to be found among them that did not\ndeserve the penalty of fire.\n\"No,\" said the niece, \"there is no reason for showing mercy to any of them; they have every one of them\ndone mischief; better fling them out of the window into the court and make a pile of them and set fire to\nthem; or else carry them into the yard, and there a bonfire can be made without the smoke giving any\nannoyance.\" The housekeeper said the same, so eager were they both for the slaughter of those innocents,\nbut the curate would not agree to it without first reading at any rate the titles.\nThe first that Master Nicholas put into his hand was \"The four books of Amadis of Gaul.\" \"This seems a\nmysterious thing,\" said the curate, \"for, as I have heard say, this was the first book of chivalry printed in\nSpain, and from this all the others derive their birth and origin; so it seems to me that we ought inexorably\nto condemn it to the flames as the founder of so vile a sect.\"\n\"Nay, sir,\" said the barber, \"I too, have heard say that this is the best of all the books of this kind that\nhave been written, and so, as something singular in its line, it ought to be pardoned.\"\n\"True,\" said the curate; \"and for that reason let its life be spared for the present. Let us see that other\nwhich is next to it.\"\n\"It is,\" said the barber, \"the 'Sallies of Esplandian,' the lawful son of Amadis of Gaul.\"\n-15\n\n\"Then verily,\" said the curate, \"the merit of the father must not be put down to the account of the son.\nTake it, mistress housekeeper; open the window and fling it into the yard and lay the foundation of the\npile for the bonfire we are to make.\"\nThe housekeeper obeyed with great satisfaction, and the worthy \"Esplandian\" went flying into the yard to\nawait with all patience the fire that was in store for him.\n\"Proceed,\" said the curate.\n\"This that comes next,\" said the barber, \"is 'Amadis of Greece,' and, indeed, I believe all those on this\nside are of the same Amadis lineage.\"\n\"Then to the yard with the whole of them,\" said the curate; \"for to have the burning of Queen\nPintiquiniestra, and the shepherd Darinel and his eclogues, and the bedevilled and involved discourses of\nhis author, I would burn with them the father who begot me if he were going about in the guise of a\nknight-errant.\"\n\"I am of the same mind,\" said the barber.\n\"And so am I,\" added the niece.\n\"In that case,\" said the housekeeper, \"here, into the yard with them!\"\nThey were handed to her, and as there were many of them, she spared herself the staircase, and flung\nthem down out of the window.\nNot caring to tire himself with reading the titles of more books of chivalry, the Barber told the\nhousekeeper to take all the big ones and throw them into the yard. It was not said to one dull or deaf, but\nto one who enjoyed burning them more than weaving the broadest and finest web that could be; and\nseizing about eight at a time, she flung them out of the window.\nIn carrying so many together she let one fall at the feet of the barber, who took it up, curious to know\nwhose it was, and found it said, \"History of the Famous Knight, Tirante the White.\"\n\"God bless me!\" said the curate with a shout, \"'Tirante the White' here! Hand it over, my friend, for in it I\nreckon I have found a treasury of enjoyment and a mine of recreation. Here is Don Kyrieleison of\nMontalvan, a valiant knight, and his brother Thomas of Montalvan, and the knight Fonseca, with the\nbattle the bold Tirante fought with the mastiff, and the witticisms of the damsel Pleasureofmylife, and the\nloves and wiles of the widow Liedown, and the empress in love with the squire Hippolito--in truth, my\nfriend, by right of its style it is the best book in the world. Here knights eat and sleep, and die in their\nbeds, and make their wills before dying, and a great deal more of which there is nothing in all the other\nbooks. Nevertheless, I say he who wrote it, for deliberately composing such fooleries, deserves to be sent\nto the galleys for life. Take it home with you and read it, and you will see that what I have said is true.\"\n\"As you will,\" said the barber; \"but what are we to do with these little books that are left?\"\n\"These must be, not chivalry, but poetry,\" said the curate; and opening one he saw it was the \"Diana\" of\nJorge de Montemayor, and, supposing all the others to be of the same sort, \"these,\" he said, \"do not\ndeserve to be burned like the others, for they neither do nor can do the mischief the books of chivalry\nhave done, being books of entertainment that can hurt no one.\"\n-16\n\n\"Ah, senor!\" said the niece, \"your worship had better order these to be burned as well as the others; for it\nwould be no wonder if, after being cured of his chivalry disorder, my uncle, by reading these, took a\nfancy to turn shepherd and range the woods and fields singing and piping; or, what would be still worse,\nto turn poet, which they say is an incurable and infectious malady.\"\n\"The girl is right,\" said the curate, \"and it will be well to put this stumbling-block and temptation out of\nour friend's way. But what is that book set apart from the rest?\"\n\"The 'Galatea' of Miguel de Cervantes,\" said the barber.\n\"That Cervantes has been for many years a great friend of mine, and to my knowledge he has had more\nexperience in reverses than in verses. His book has some good invention in it, it presents us with\nsomething but brings nothing to a conclusion: we must wait for the Second Part it promises: perhaps with\namendment it may succeed in winning the full measure of grace that is now denied it; and in the mean\ntime keep it in isolation in your own quarters.\"\nAt this instant Don Quixote began shouting out, \"Here, here, valiant knights! here is need for you to put\nforth the might of your strong arms, for weakling courtiers are winning the tourney!\" Called away by this\nnoise and outcry, they proceeded no farther with the scrutiny of the remaining books. When they reached\nDon Quixote he was already out of bed, and was still shouting and raving, and slashing and cutting all\nround, as wide awake as if he had never slept.\nThey closed with him and by force got him back to bed, and when he had become a little calm, addressing\nthe curate, he said to him, \"Of a truth, Senor Archbishop Turpin, it is a great disgrace for us who call\nourselves the Twelve Peers, so carelessly to allow the knights of the Court to gain the victory in this\ntourney, we the adventurers having carried off the honour on the three former days.\"\n\"Hush, my friend,\" said the curate; \"please God, the luck may turn, and what is lost to-day may be won\nto-morrow; for the present let your worship have a care of your health, for it seems to me that you are\nover-fatigued, if not badly wounded.\"\n\"Wounded no,\" said Don Quixote, \"but bruised and battered no doubt, for that bastard Don Roland has\ncudgelled me with the trunk of an oak tree, and all for envy, because he sees that I alone rival him in his\nachievements. But I should not call myself Rinaldo of Montalvan did he not pay me for it in spite of all\nhis enchantments as soon as I rise from this bed. For the present let them bring me something to eat, for\nthat, I feel, is what will be more to my purpose, and leave it to me to avenge myself.\"\nThey did as he wished; they gave him something to eat, and once more he fell asleep, leaving them\nmarvelling at his madness.\nThat night the housekeeper burned to ashes all the books that were in the yard and in the whole house;\nand some must have been consumed that deserved preservation in everlasting archives, but their fate and\nthe laziness of the examiner did not permit it, and so in them was verified the proverb that the innocent\nsuffer for the guilty.\nOne of the remedies which the curate and the barber immediately applied to their friend's disorder was to\nwall up and plaster the room where the books were, so that when he got up he should not find them\n(possibly the cause being removed the effect might cease), and they might say that an enchanter had\ncarried them off, room and all; and this was done with all despatch. Two days later Don Quixote got up,\nand the first thing he did was to go and look at his books, and not finding the room where he had left it, he\nwandered from side to side looking for it. He came to the place where the door used to be, and tried it\n-17\n\nwith his hands, and turned and twisted his eyes in every direction without saying a word; but after a good\nwhile he asked his housekeeper whereabouts was the room that held his books.\nThe housekeeper, who had been already well instructed in what she was to answer, said, \"What room or\nwhat nothing is it that your worship is looking for? There are neither room nor books in this house now,\nfor the devil himself has carried all away.\"\n\"It was not the devil,\" said the niece, \"but a enchanter who came on a cloud one night after the day your\nworship left this, and dismounting from a serpent that he rode he entered the room, and what he did there\nI know not, but after a little while he made off, flying through the roof, and left the house full of smoke;\nand when we went to see what he had done we saw neither book nor room: but we remember very well,\nthe housekeeper and I, that on leaving, the old villain said in a loud voice that, for a private grudge he\nowed the owner of the books and the room, he had done mischief in that house that would be discovered\nby-and-by: he said too that his name was the wizard Munaton.\"\n\"He must have said Friston,\" said Don Quixote.\n\"I don't know whether he called himself Friston or Friton,\" said the housekeeper, \"I only know that his\nname ended with 'ton.'\"\n\"So it does,\" said Don Quixote, \"and he is a learned enchanter, a great enemy of mine, who has a spite\nagainst me because he knows by his arts and lore that in process of time I am to engage in single combat\nwith a knight whom he befriends and that I am to conquer, and he will be unable to prevent it; and for this\nreason he endeavours to do me all the ill turns that he can; but I promise him it will be hard for him to\noppose or avoid what is decreed by Heaven.\"\n\"Who doubts that?\" said the niece; \"but, uncle, who mixes you up in these quarrels? Would it not be\nbetter to remain at peace in your own house instead of roaming the world looking for better bread than\never came of wheat, never reflecting that many go for wool and come back shorn?\"\n\"Oh, niece of mine,\" replied Don Quixote, \"how much astray art thou in thy reckoning: ere they shear me\nI shall have plucked away and stripped off the beards of all who dare to touch only the tip of a hair of\nmine.\"\nThe two were unwilling to make any further answer, as they saw that his anger was kindling.\nIn short, then, he remained at home fifteen days very quietly without showing any signs of a desire to take\nup with his former delusions, and during this time he held lively discussions with his two good friends,\nthe curate and the barber, on the point he maintained, that knights-errant were what the world stood most\nin need of, and that in him was to be accomplished the revival of knight-errantry. The curate sometimes\ncontradicted him, sometimes agreed with him, for if he had not observed this precaution he would have\nbeen unable to bring him to reason.\nMeanwhile Don Quixote worked upon a farm labourer, a neighbour of his, an honest man (if indeed the\nword can be applied to one who is poor), but with very little wit in his pate. In a word, he so talked him\nover, and with such persuasions and promises, that the poor clown made up his mind to sally forth with\nhim and serve him as esquire. Don Quixote, among other things, told him he ought to be ready to go with\nhim gladly, because any moment an adventure might occur that might win an island in the twinkling of an\neye and leave him governor of it. On these and the like promises Sancho Panza (for so the labourer was\ncalled) left wife and children, and engaged himself as esquire to his neighbour.\n-18\n\nDon Quixote next set about getting some money; and selling one thing and pawning another, and making\na bad bargain in every case, he got together a fair sum. He provided himself with a buckler, which he\nbegged as a loan from a friend, and, restoring his battered helmet as best he could, he warned his squire\nSancho of the day and hour he meant to set out, that he might provide himself with what he thought most\nneedful. Above all, he charged him to take saddlebags with him. The other said he would, and that he\nmeant to take also a very good ass he had, as he was not much given to going on foot. About the ass, Don\nQuixote hesitated a little, trying whether he could call to mind any knight-errant taking with him an\nesquire mounted on ass-back, but no instance occurred to his memory. For all that, however, he\ndetermined to take him, intending to furnish him with a more honourable mount when a chance of it\npresented itself, by appropriating the horse of the first discourteous knight he encountered. Himself he\nprovided with shirts and such other things as he could, according to the advice the host had given him; all\nwhich being done, without taking leave, Sancho Panza of his wife and children, or Don Quixote of his\nhousekeeper and niece, they sallied forth unseen by anybody from the village one night, and made such\ngood way in the course of it that by daylight they held themselves safe from discovery, even should\nsearch be made for them.\nSancho rode on his ass like a patriarch, with his saddlebags and bota, and longing to see himself soon\ngovernor of the island his master had promised him. Don Quixote decided upon taking the same route and\nroad he had taken on his first journey, that over the Campo de Montiel, which he travelled with less\ndiscomfort than on the last occasion, for, as it was early morning and the rays of the sun fell on them\nobliquely, the heat did not distress them. And now said Sancho Panza to his master, \"Your worship will\ntake care, Senor Knight-errant, not to forget about the island you have promised me, for be it ever so big\nI'll be equal to governing it.\"\nTo which Don Quixote replied, \"Thou must know, friend Sancho Panza, that it was a practice very much\nin vogue with the knights-errant of old to make their squires governors of the islands or kingdoms they\nwon, and I am determined that there shall be no failure on my part in so liberal a custom; on the contrary,\nI mean to improve upon it, for they sometimes, and perhaps most frequently, waited until their squires\nwere old, and then when they had had enough of service and hard days and worse nights, they gave them\nsome title or other, of count, or at the most marquis, of some valley or province more or less; but if thou\nlivest and I live, it may well be that before six days are over, I may have won some kingdom that has\nothers dependent upon it, which will be just the thing to enable thee to be crowned king of one of them.\nNor needst thou count this wonderful, for things and chances fall to the lot of such knights in ways so\nunexampled and unexpected that I might easily give thee even more than I promise thee.\"\n\"In that case,\" said Sancho Panza, \"if I should become a king by one of those miracles your worship\nspeaks of, even Juana Gutierrez, my old woman, would come to be queen and my children infantes.\"\n\"Well, who doubts it?\" said Don Quixote.\n\"I doubt it,\" replied Sancho Panza, \"because for my part I am persuaded that though God should shower\ndown kingdoms upon earth, not one of them would fit the head of Mari Gutierrez. Let me tell you, senor,\nshe is not worth two maravedis for a queen; countess will fit her better, and that only with God's help.\"\n\"Leave it to God, Sancho,\" returned Don Quixote, \"for he will give her what suits her best; but do not\nundervalue thyself so much as to come to be content with anything less than being governor of a\nprovince.\"\n\"I will not, senor,\" answered Sancho, \"specially as I have a man of such quality for a master in your\nworship, who will know what is suitable for me and what I can carry.\"\n-19\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\nOF THE GOOD FORTUNE WHICH THE VALIANT DON QUIXOTE HAD IN THE TERRIBLE AND\nUNDREAMT-OF ADVENTURE OF THE WINDMILLS, WITH OTHER OCCURRENCES WORTHY\nTO BE FITLY RECORDED\nAt this point they came in sight of thirty or forty windmills that there are on plain, and as soon as Don\nQuixote saw them he said to his squire, \"Fortune is arranging matters for us better than we could have\nshaped our desires ourselves, for look there, friend Sancho Panza, where thirty or more monstrous giants\npresent themselves, all of whom I mean to engage in battle and slay, and with whose spoils we shall begin\nto make our fortunes; for this is righteous warfare, and it is God's good service to sweep so evil a breed\nfrom off the face of the earth.\"\n\"What giants?\" said Sancho Panza.\n\"Those thou seest there,\" answered his master, \"with the long arms, and some have them nearly two\nleagues long.\"\n\"Look, your worship,\" said Sancho; \"what we see there are not giants but windmills, and what seem to be\ntheir arms are the sails that turned by the wind make the millstone go.\"\n\"It is easy to see,\" replied Don Quixote, \"that thou art not used to this business of adventures; those are\ngiants; and if thou art afraid, away with thee out of this and betake thyself to prayer while I engage them\nin fierce and unequal combat.\"\nSo saying, he gave the spur to his steed Rocinante, heedless of the cries his squire Sancho sent after him,\nwarning him that most certainly they were windmills and not giants he was going to attack. He, however,\nwas so positive they were giants that he neither heard the cries of Sancho, nor perceived, near as he was,\nwhat they were, but made at them shouting, \"Fly not, cowards and vile beings, for a single knight attacks\nyou.\"\nA slight breeze at this moment sprang up, and the great sails began to move, seeing which Don Quixote\nexclaimed, \"Though ye flourish more arms than the giant Briareus, ye have to reckon with me.\"\nSo saying, and commending himself with all his heart to his lady Dulcinea, imploring her to support him\nin such a peril, with lance in rest and covered by his buckler, he charged at Rocinante's fullest gallop and\nfell upon the first mill that stood in front of him; but as he drove his lance-point into the sail the wind\nwhirled it round with such force that it shivered the lance to pieces, sweeping with it horse and rider, who\nwent rolling over on the plain, in a sorry condition. Sancho hastened to his assistance as fast as his ass\ncould go, and when he came up found him unable to move, with such a shock had Rocinante fallen with\nhim.\n\"God bless me!\" said Sancho, \"did I not tell your worship to mind what you were about, for they were\nonly windmills? and no one could have made any mistake about it but one who had something of the\nsame kind in his head.\"\n\"Hush, friend Sancho,\" replied Don Quixote, \"the fortunes of war more than any other are liable to\nfrequent fluctuations; and moreover I think, and it is the truth, that that same sage Friston who carried off\nmy study and books, has turned these giants into mills in order to rob me of the glory of vanquishing\nthem, such is the enmity he bears me; but in the end his wicked arts will avail but little against my good\nsword.\"\n-20\n\n\"God order it as he may,\" said Sancho Panza, and helping him to rise got him up again on Rocinante,\nwhose shoulder was half out; and then, discussing the late adventure, they followed the road to the Pass of\nLapice, for there, said Don Quixote, they could not fail to find adventures in abundance and variety, as it\nwas a great thoroughfare. For all that, he was much grieved at the loss of his lance, and saying so to his\nsquire, he added, \"I remember having read how a Spanish knight, Diego Perez de Vargas by name, having\nbroken his sword in battle, tore from an oak a ponderous bough or branch, and with it did such things that\nday, and pounded so many Moors, that he got the surname of Machuca, and he and his descendants from\nthat day forth were called Vargas y Machuca. I mention this because from the first oak I see I mean to\nrend such another branch, large and stout like that, with which I am determined and resolved to do such\ndeeds that thou mayest deem thyself very fortunate in being found worthy to come and see them, and be\nan eyewitness of things that will with difficulty be believed.\"\n\"Be that as God will,\" said Sancho, \"I believe it all as your worship says it; but straighten yourself a little,\nfor you seem all on one side, may be from the shaking of the fall.\"\n\"That is the truth,\" said Don Quixote, \"and if I make no complaint of the pain it is because knights-errant\nare not permitted to complain of any wound, even though their bowels be coming out through it.\"\n\"If so,\" said Sancho, \"I have nothing to say; but God knows I would rather your worship complained\nwhen anything ailed you. For my part, I confess I must complain however small the ache may be; unless\nthis rule about not complaining extends to the squires of knights-errant also.\"\nDon Quixote could not help laughing at his squire's simplicity, and he assured him he might complain\nwhenever and however he chose, just as he liked, for, so far, he had never read of anything to the contrary\nin the order of knighthood. Sancho bade him remember it was dinner-time, to which his master answered\nthat he wanted nothing himself just then, but that he might eat when he had a mind. With this permission\nSancho settled himself as comfortably as he could on his beast, and taking out of the saddlebags what he\nhad stowed away in them, he jogged along behind his master munching deliberately, and from time to\ntime taking a pull at the bota with a relish that the thirstiest tapster in Malaga might have envied; and\nwhile he went on in this way, gulping down draught after draught, he never gave a thought to any of the\npromises his master had made him, nor did he rate it as hardship but rather as recreation going in quest of\nadventures, however dangerous they might be. Finally they passed the night among some trees, from one\nof which Don Quixote plucked a dry branch to serve him after a fashion as a lance, and fixed on it the\nhead he had removed from the broken one.\nAll that night Don Quixote lay awake thinking of his lady Dulcinea, in order to conform to what he had\nread in his books, how many a night in the forests and deserts knights used to lie sleepless supported by\nthe memory of their mistresses. Not so did Sancho Panza spend it, for having his stomach full of\nsomething stronger than chicory water he made but one sleep of it, and, if his master had not called him,\nneither the rays of the sun beating on his face nor all the cheery notes of the birds welcoming the\napproach of day would have had power to waken him. On getting up he tried the bota and found it\nsomewhat less full than the night before, which grieved his heart because they did not seem to be on the\nway to remedy the deficiency readily. Don Quixote did not care to break his fast, for, as has been already\nsaid, he confined himself to savoury recollections for nourishment.\nThey returned to the road they had set out upon, leading to the Pass of Lapice, and at three in the\nafternoon they came in sight of it. \"Here, brother Sancho Panza,\" said Don Quixote when he saw it, \"we\nmay plunge our hands up to the elbows in what they call adventures; but observe, even shouldst thou see\nme in the greatest danger in the world, thou must not put a hand to thy sword in my defence, unless\nindeed thou perceivest that those who assail me are rabble or base folk; for in that case thou mayest very\nproperly aid me; but if they be knights it is on no account permitted or allowed thee by the laws of\n-21\n\nknighthood to help me until thou hast been dubbed a knight.\"\n\"Most certainly, senor,\" replied Sancho, \"your worship shall be fully obeyed in this matter; all the more\nas of myself I am peaceful and no friend to mixing in strife and quarrels: it is true that as regards the\ndefence of my own person I shall not give much heed to those laws, for laws human and divine allow\neach one to defend himself against any assailant whatever.\"\n\"That I grant,\" said Don Quixote, \"but in this matter of aiding me against knights thou must put a restraint\nupon thy natural impetuosity.\"\n\"I will do so, I promise you,\" answered Sancho, \"and will keep this precept as carefully as Sunday.\"\nWhile they were thus talking there appeared on the road two friars of the order of St. Benedict, mounted\non two dromedaries, for not less tall were the two mules they rode on. They wore travelling spectacles\nand carried sunshades; and behind them came a coach attended by four or five persons on horseback and\ntwo muleteers on foot. In the coach there was, as afterwards appeared, a Biscay lady on her way to\nSeville, where her husband was about to take passage for the Indies with an appointment of high honour.\nThe friars, though going the same road, were not in her company; but the moment Don Quixote perceived\nthem he said to his squire, \"Either I am mistaken, or this is going to be the most famous adventure that\nhas ever been seen, for those black bodies we see there must be, and doubtless are, enchanters who are\ncarrying off some stolen princess in that coach, and with all my might I must undo this wrong.\"\n\"This will be worse than the windmills,\" said Sancho. \"Look, senor; those are friars of St. Benedict, and\nthe coach plainly belongs to some travellers: I tell you to mind well what you are about and don't let the\ndevil mislead you.\"\n\"I have told thee already, Sancho,\" replied Don Quixote, \"that on the subject of adventures thou knowest\nlittle. What I say is the truth, as thou shalt see presently.\"\nSo saying, he advanced and posted himself in the middle of the road along which the friars were coming,\nand as soon as he thought they had come near enough to hear what he said, he cried aloud, \"Devilish and\nunnatural beings, release instantly the highborn princesses whom you are carrying off by force in this\ncoach, else prepare to meet a speedy death as the just punishment of your evil deeds.\"\nThe friars drew rein and stood wondering at the appearance of Don Quixote as well as at his words, to\nwhich they replied, \"Sir Knight, we are not devilish or unnatural, but two brothers of St. Benedict\nfollowing our road, nor do we know whether or not there are any captive princesses coming in this\ncoach.\"\n\"No soft words with me, for I know you, lying rabble,\" said Don Quixote, and without waiting for a reply\nhe spurred Rocinante and with levelled lance charged the first friar with such fury and determination, that,\nif the friar had not flung himself off the mule, he would have brought him to the ground against his will,\nand sore wounded, if not killed outright. The second brother, seeing how his comrade was treated, drove\nhis heels into his castle of a mule and made off across the country faster than the wind.\nSancho Panza, when he saw the friar on the ground, dismounting briskly from his ass, rushed towards him\nand began to strip off his gown. At that instant the friars muleteers came up and asked what he was\nstripping him for. Sancho answered them that this fell to him lawfully as spoil of the battle which his lord\nDon Quixote had won. The muleteers, who had no idea of a joke and did not understand all this about\nbattles and spoils, seeing that Don Quixote was some distance off talking to the travellers in the coach,\nfell upon Sancho, knocked him down, and leaving hardly a hair in his beard, belaboured him with kicks\n-22\n\nand left him stretched breathless and senseless on the ground; and without any more delay helped the friar\nto mount, who, trembling, terrified, and pale, as soon as he found himself in the saddle, spurred after his\ncompanion, who was standing at a distance looking on, watching the result of the onslaught; then, not\ncaring to wait for the end of the affair just begun, they pursued their journey making more crosses than if\nthey had the devil after them.\nDon Quixote was, as has been said, speaking to the lady in the coach: \"Your beauty, lady mine,\" said he,\n\"may now dispose of your person as may be most in accordance with your pleasure, for the pride of your\nravishers lies prostrate on the ground through this strong arm of mine; and lest you should be pining to\nknow the name of your deliverer, know that I am called Don Quixote of La Mancha, knight-errant and\nadventurer, and captive to the peerless and beautiful lady Dulcinea del Toboso: and in return for the\nservice you have received of me I ask no more than that you should return to El Toboso, and on my\nbehalf present yourself before that lady and tell her what I have done to set you free.\"\nOne of the squires in attendance upon the coach, a Biscayan, was listening to all Don Quixote was saying,\nand, perceiving that he would not allow the coach to go on, but was saying it must return at once to El\nToboso, he made at him, and seizing his lance addressed him in bad Castilian, which all Biscayans speak\nbadly, \"Begone, knight, and go to Devil; by God that made me, unless thou quittest coach, me slayest thee\nas me art here a Biscayan.\"\nDon Quixote understood him quite well, and answered him very quietly, \"If thou wert a knight, as thou\nart none, I should have already chastised thy folly and rashness, miserable creature.\" To which the\nBiscayan returned, \"I no gentleman!--I swear to God thou liest as I Christian: if thou droppest lance and\ndrawest sword, soon shalt thou see thou art carrying water to the cat: Biscayan on land, nobleman at sea,\nnobleman by devil, and look, if thou sayest other, thou liest.\"\n\"You will see presently, to quote Agrages,\" replied Don Quixote; and throwing his lance on the ground\nhe drew his sword, braced his buckler, and attacked the Biscayan, bent upon taking his life.\nThe Biscayan, when he saw him coming on, wished to dismount from his mule, but he had time only to\ndraw his sword; it was lucky for him, however, that he was near the coach, from which he was able to\nsnatch a cushion that served him for a shield; and they went at one another as if they had been two mortal\nenemies. The others strove to make peace between them, but could not, for the Biscayan declared in his\ndisjointed phrase that if they did not let him finish his battle he would kill his mistress and everyone that\nstrove to prevent him. The lady in the coach, amazed and terrified at what she saw, ordered the coachman\nto draw aside a little, and set herself to watch this severe struggle, in the course of which the Biscayan\nsmote Don Quixote a mighty stroke on the shoulder over the top of his buckler, which, given to one\nwithout armour, would have cleft him to the waist. Don Quixote, feeling the weight of this prodigious\nblow, cried aloud, saying, \"O lady of my soul, Dulcinea, flower of beauty, come to the aid of this your\nknight, who, in fulfilling his obligations to your beauty, finds himself in this extreme peril.\" To say this,\nto lift his sword, to shelter himself well behind his buckler, and to assail the Biscayan was the work of an\ninstant, determined as he was to venture all upon a single blow. The Biscayan, seeing him come on in this\nway, was convinced of his courage by his spirited bearing, and resolved to follow his example, so he\nwaited for him keeping well under cover of his cushion, being unable to execute any sort of manoeuvre\nwith his mule, which, dead tired and never meant for this kind of game, could not stir a step.\nOn, then, as aforesaid, came Don Quixote against the wary Biscayan, with uplifted sword and a firm\nintention of splitting him in half, while on his side the Biscayan waited for him sword in hand, and under\nthe protection of his cushion; and all present stood trembling, waiting in suspense the result of blows such\nas threatened to fall, and the lady in the coach and the rest of her following were making a thousand vows\nand offerings to all the images and shrines of Spain, that God might deliver her squire and all of them\n-23\n\nfrom this great peril in which they found themselves. But it spoils all, that at this point and crisis the\nauthor of the history leaves this battle impending, giving as excuse that he could find nothing more\nwritten about these achievements of Don Quixote than what has been already set forth. It is true the\nsecond author of this work was unwilling to believe that a history so curious could have been allowed to\nfall under the sentence of oblivion, or that the wits of La Mancha could have been so undiscerning as not\nto preserve in their archives or registries some documents referring to this famous knight; and this being\nhis persuasion, he did not despair of finding the conclusion of this pleasant history, which, heaven\nfavouring him, he did find in a way that shall be related in the Second Part of this history.\nCHAPTER IX.\nIN WHICH IS CONCLUDED AND FINISHED THE TERRIFIC BATTLE BETWEEN THE\nGALLANT BISCAYAN AND THE VALIANT MANCHEGAN\nIn the First Part of this history we left the valiant Biscayan and the renowned Don Quixote with drawn\nswords uplifted, ready to deliver two such furious slashing blows that if they had fallen full and fair they\nwould at least have split and cleft them asunder from top to toe and laid them open like a pomegranate;\nand at this so critical point the delightful history came to a stop and stood cut short without any intimation\nfrom the author where what was missing was to be found.\nThis distressed me greatly, because the pleasure derived from having read such a small portion turned to\nvexation at the thought of the poor chance that presented itself of finding the large part that, so it seemed\nto me, was missing of such an interesting tale. It appeared to me to be a thing impossible and contrary to\nall precedent that so good a knight should have been without some sage to undertake the task of writing\nhis marvellous achievements; a thing that was never wanting to any of those knights-errant who, they say,\nwent after adventures; for every one of them had one or two sages as if made on purpose, who not only\nrecorded their deeds but described their most trifling thoughts and follies, however secret they might be;\nand such a good knight could not have been so unfortunate as not to have what Platir and others like him\nhad in abundance. And so I could not bring myself to believe that such a gallant tale had been left maimed\nand mutilated, and I laid the blame on Time, the devourer and destroyer of all things, that had either\nconcealed or consumed it.\nAt the same time, it struck me that, inasmuch as among his books there had been found such modern ones\nas \"The Enlightenment of Jealousy\" and the \"Nymphs and Shepherds of Henares,\" his story must likewise\nbe modern, and that though it might not be written, it might exist in the memory of the people of his\nvillage and of those in the neighbourhood. This reflection kept me perplexed and longing to know really\nand truly the whole life and wondrous deeds of our famous Spaniard, Don Quixote of La Mancha, light\nand mirror of Manchegan chivalry, and the first that in our age and in these so evil days devoted himself\nto the labour and exercise of the arms of knight-errantry, righting wrongs, succouring widows, and\nprotecting damsels of that sort that used to ride about, whip in hand, on their palfreys, with all their\nvirginity about them, from mountain to mountain and valley to valley--for, if it were not for some ruffian,\nor boor with a hood and hatchet, or monstrous giant, that forced them, there were in days of yore damsels\nthat at the end of eighty years, in all which time they had never slept a day under a roof, went to their\ngraves as much maids as the mothers that bore them. I say, then, that in these and other respects our\ngallant Don Quixote is worthy of everlasting and notable praise, nor should it be withheld even from me\nfor the labour and pains spent in searching for the conclusion of this delightful history; though I know\nwell that if Heaven, chance and good fortune had not helped me, the world would have remained deprived\nof an entertainment and pleasure that for a couple of hours or so may well occupy him who shall read it\nattentively. The discovery of it occurred in this way.\nOne day, as I was in the Alcana of Toledo, a boy came up to sell some pamphlets and old papers to a silk\n-24\n\nmercer, and, as I am fond of reading even the very scraps of paper in the streets, led by this natural bent of\nmine I took up one of the pamphlets the boy had for sale, and saw that it was in characters which I\nrecognised as Arabic, and as I was unable to read them though I could recognise them, I looked about to\nsee if there were any Spanish-speaking Morisco at hand to read them for me; nor was there any great\ndifficulty in finding such an interpreter, for even had I sought one for an older and better language I\nshould have found him. In short, chance provided me with one, who when I told him what I wanted and\nput the book into his hands, opened it in the middle and after reading a little in it began to laugh. I asked\nhim what he was laughing at, and he replied that it was at something the book had written in the margin\nby way of a note. I bade him tell it to me; and he still laughing said, \"In the margin, as I told you, this is\nwritten: 'This Dulcinea del Toboso so often mentioned in this history, had, they say, the best hand of any\nwoman in all La Mancha for salting pigs.'\"\nWhen I heard Dulcinea del Toboso named, I was struck with surprise and amazement, for it occurred to\nme at once that these pamphlets contained the history of Don Quixote. With this idea I pressed him to\nread the beginning, and doing so, turning the Arabic offhand into Castilian, he told me it meant, \"History\nof Don Quixote of La Mancha, written by Cide Hamete Benengeli, an Arab historian.\" It required great\ncaution to hide the joy I felt when the title of the book reached my ears, and snatching it from the silk\nmercer, I bought all the papers and pamphlets from the boy for half a real; and if he had had his wits\nabout him and had known how eager I was for them, he might have safely calculated on making more\nthan six reals by the bargain. I withdrew at once with the Morisco into the cloister of the cathedral, and\nbegged him to turn all these pamphlets that related to Don Quixote into the Castilian tongue, without\nomitting or adding anything to them, offering him whatever payment he pleased. He was satisfied with\ntwo arrobas of raisins and two bushels of wheat, and promised to translate them faithfully and with all\ndespatch; but to make the matter easier, and not to let such a precious find out of my hands, I took him to\nmy house, where in little more than a month and a half he translated the whole just as it is set down here.\nIn the first pamphlet the battle between Don Quixote and the Biscayan was drawn to the very life, they\nplanted in the same attitude as the history describes, their swords raised, and the one protected by his\nbuckler, the other by his cushion, and the Biscayan's mule so true to nature that it could be seen to be a\nhired one a bowshot off. The Biscayan had an inscription under his feet which said, \"Don Sancho de\nAzpeitia,\" which no doubt must have been his name; and at the feet of Rocinante was another that said,\n\"Don Quixote.\" Rocinante was marvellously portrayed, so long and thin, so lank and lean, with so much\nbackbone and so far gone in consumption, that he showed plainly with what judgment and propriety the\nname of Rocinante had been bestowed upon him. Near him was Sancho Panza holding the halter of his\nass, at whose feet was another label that said, \"Sancho Zancas,\" and according to the picture, he must\nhave had a big belly, a short body, and long shanks, for which reason, no doubt, the names of Panza and\nZancas were given him, for by these two surnames the history several times calls him. Some other trifling\nparticulars might be mentioned, but they are all of slight importance and have nothing to do with the true\nrelation of the history; and no history can be bad so long as it is true.\nIf against the present one any objection be raised on the score of its truth, it can only be that its author\nwas an Arab, as lying is a very common propensity with those of that nation; though, as they are such\nenemies of ours, it is conceivable that there were omissions rather than additions made in the course of it.\nAnd this is my own opinion; for, where he could and should give freedom to his pen in praise of so\nworthy a knight, he seems to me deliberately to pass it over in silence; which is ill done and worse\ncontrived, for it is the business and duty of historians to be exact, truthful, and wholly free from passion,\nand neither interest nor fear, hatred nor love, should make them swerve from the path of truth, whose\nmother is history, rival of time, storehouse of deeds, witness for the past, example and counsel for the\npresent, and warning for the future. In this I know will be found all that can be desired in the pleasantest,\nand if it be wanting in any good quality, I maintain it is the fault of its hound of an author and not the\nfault of the subject. To be brief, its Second Part, according to the translation, began in this way:\n-25\n\nWith trenchant swords upraised and poised on high, it seemed as though the two valiant and wrathful\ncombatants stood threatening heaven, and earth, and hell, with such resolution and determination did they\nbear themselves. The fiery Biscayan was the first to strike a blow, which was delivered with such force\nand fury that had not the sword turned in its course, that single stroke would have sufficed to put an end\nto the bitter struggle and to all the adventures of our knight; but that good fortune which reserved him for\ngreater things, turned aside the sword of his adversary, so that although it smote him upon the left\nshoulder, it did him no more harm than to strip all that side of its armour, carrying away a great part of his\nhelmet with half of his ear, all which with fearful ruin fell to the ground, leaving him in a sorry plight.\nGood God! Who is there that could properly describe the rage that filled the heart of our Manchegan\nwhen he saw himself dealt with in this fashion? All that can be said is, it was such that he again raised\nhimself in his stirrups, and, grasping his sword more firmly with both hands, he came down on the\nBiscayan with such fury, smiting him full over the cushion and over the head, that--even so good a shield\nproving useless--as if a mountain had fallen on him, he began to bleed from nose, mouth, and ears, reeling\nas if about to fall backwards from his mule, as no doubt he would have done had he not flung his arms\nabout its neck; at the same time, however, he slipped his feet out of the stirrups and then unclasped his\narms, and the mule, taking fright at the terrible blow, made off across the plain, and with a few plunges\nflung its master to the ground. Don Quixote stood looking on very calmly, and, when he saw him fall,\nleaped from his horse and with great briskness ran to him, and, presenting the point of his sword to his\neyes, bade him surrender, or he would cut his head off. The Biscayan was so bewildered that he was\nunable to answer a word, and it would have gone hard with him, so blind was Don Quixote, had not the\nladies in the coach, who had hitherto been watching the combat in great terror, hastened to where he stood\nand implored him with earnest entreaties to grant them the great grace and favour of sparing their squire's\nlife; to which Don Quixote replied with much gravity and dignity, \"In truth, fair ladies, I am well content\nto do what ye ask of me; but it must be on one condition and understanding, which is that this knight\npromise me to go to the village of El Toboso, and on my behalf present himself before the peerless lady\nDulcinea, that she deal with him as shall be most pleasing to her.\"\nThe terrified and disconsolate ladies, without discussing Don Quixote's demand or asking who Dulcinea\nmight be, promised that their squire should do all that had been commanded.\n\"Then, on the faith of that promise,\" said Don Quixote, \"I shall do him no further harm, though he well\ndeserves it of me.\"\nCHAPTER X.\nOF THE PLEASANT DISCOURSE THAT PASSED BETWEEN DON QUIXOTE AND HIS SQUIRE\nSANCHO PANZA\nNow by this time Sancho had risen, rather the worse for the handling of the friars' muleteers, and stood\nwatching the battle of his master, Don Quixote, and praying to God in his heart that it might be his will to\ngrant him the victory, and that he might thereby win some island to make him governor of, as he had\npromised. Seeing, therefore, that the struggle was now over, and that his master was returning to mount\nRocinante, he approached to hold the stirrup for him, and, before he could mount, he went on his knees\nbefore him, and taking his hand, kissed it saying, \"May it please your worship, Senor Don Quixote, to\ngive me the government of that island which has been won in this hard fight, for be it ever so big I feel\nmyself in sufficient force to be able to govern it as much and as well as anyone in the world who has ever\ngoverned islands.\"\nTo which Don Quixote replied, \"Thou must take notice, brother Sancho, that this adventure and those like\nit are not adventures of islands, but of cross-roads, in which nothing is got except a broken head or an ear\n-26\n\nthe less: have patience, for adventures will present themselves from which I may make you, not only a\ngovernor, but something more.\"\nSancho gave him many thanks, and again kissing his hand and the skirt of his hauberk, helped him to\nmount Rocinante, and mounting his ass himself, proceeded to follow his master, who at a brisk pace,\nwithout taking leave, or saying anything further to the ladies belonging to the coach, turned into a wood\nthat was hard by. Sancho followed him at his ass's best trot, but Rocinante stepped out so that, seeing\nhimself left behind, he was forced to call to his master to wait for him. Don Quixote did so, reining in\nRocinante until his weary squire came up, who on reaching him said, \"It seems to me, senor, it would be\nprudent in us to go and take refuge in some church, for, seeing how mauled he with whom you fought has\nbeen left, it will be no wonder if they give information of the affair to the Holy Brotherhood and arrest us,\nand, faith, if they do, before we come out of gaol we shall have to sweat for it.\"\n\"Peace,\" said Don Quixote; \"where hast thou ever seen or heard that a knight-errant has been arraigned\nbefore a court of justice, however many homicides he may have committed?\"\n\"I know nothing about omecils,\" answered Sancho, \"nor in my life have had anything to do with one; I\nonly know that the Holy Brotherhood looks after those who fight in the fields, and in that other matter I\ndo not meddle.\"\n\"Then thou needst have no uneasiness, my friend,\" said Don Quixote, \"for I will deliver thee out of the\nhands of the Chaldeans, much more out of those of the Brotherhood. But tell me, as thou livest, hast thou\nseen a more valiant knight than I in all the known world; hast thou read in history of any who has or had\nhigher mettle in attack, more spirit in maintaining it, more dexterity in wounding or skill in\noverthrowing?\"\n\"The truth is,\" answered Sancho, \"that I have never read any history, for I can neither read nor write, but\nwhat I will venture to bet is that a more daring master than your worship I have never served in all the\ndays of my life, and God grant that this daring be not paid for where I have said; what I beg of your\nworship is to dress your wound, for a great deal of blood flows from that ear, and I have here some lint\nand a little white ointment in the saddlebags.\"\n\"All that might be well dispensed with,\" said Don Quixote, \"if I had remembered to make a vial of the\nbalsam of Fierabras, for time and medicine are saved by one single drop.\"\n\"What vial and what balsam is that?\" said Sancho Panza.\n\"It is a balsam,\" answered Don Quixote, \"the receipt of which I have in my memory, with which one need\nhave no fear of death, or dread dying of any wound; and so when I make it and give it to thee thou hast\nnothing to do when in some battle thou seest they have cut me in half through the middle of the body--as\nis wont to happen frequently,--but neatly and with great nicety, ere the blood congeal, to place that\nportion of the body which shall have fallen to the ground upon the other half which remains in the saddle,\ntaking care to fit it on evenly and exactly. Then thou shalt give me to drink but two drops of the balsam I\nhave mentioned, and thou shalt see me become sounder than an apple.\"\n\"If that be so,\" said Panza, \"I renounce henceforth the government of the promised island, and desire\nnothing more in payment of my many and faithful services than that your worship give me the receipt of\nthis supreme liquor, for I am persuaded it will be worth more than two reals an ounce anywhere, and I\nwant no more to pass the rest of my life in ease and honour; but it remains to be told if it costs much to\nmake it.\"\n-27\n\n\"With less than three reals, six quarts of it may be made,\" said Don Quixote.\n\"Sinner that I am!\" said Sancho, \"then why does your worship put off making it and teaching it to me?\"\n\"Peace, friend,\" answered Don Quixote; \"greater secrets I mean to teach thee and greater favours to\nbestow upon thee; and for the present let us see to the dressing, for my ear pains me more than I could\nwish.\"\nSancho took out some lint and ointment from the saddlebags; but when Don Quixote came to see his\nhelmet shattered, he was like to lose his senses, and clapping his hand upon his sword and raising his eyes\nto heaven, be said, \"I swear by the Creator of all things and the four Gospels in their fullest extent, to do\nas the great Marquis of Mantua did when he swore to avenge the death of his nephew Baldwin (and that\nwas not to eat bread from a table-cloth, nor embrace his wife, and other points which, though I cannot\nnow call them to mind, I here grant as expressed) until I take complete vengeance upon him who has\ncommitted such an offence against me.\"\nHearing this, Sancho said to him, \"Your worship should bear in mind, Senor Don Quixote, that if the\nknight has done what was commanded him in going to present himself before my lady Dulcinea del\nToboso, he will have done all that he was bound to do, and does not deserve further punishment unless he\ncommits some new offence.\"\n\"Thou hast said well and hit the point,\" answered Don Quixote; and so I recall the oath in so far as relates\nto taking fresh vengeance on him, but I make and confirm it anew to lead the life I have said until such\ntime as I take by force from some knight another helmet such as this and as good; and think not, Sancho,\nthat I am raising smoke with straw in doing so, for I have one to imitate in the matter, since the very same\nthing to a hair happened in the case of Mambrino's helmet, which cost Sacripante so dear.\"\n\"Senor,\" replied Sancho, \"let your worship send all such oaths to the devil, for they are very pernicious to\nsalvation and prejudicial to the conscience; just tell me now, if for several days to come we fall in with no\nman armed with a helmet, what are we to do? Is the oath to be observed in spite of all the inconvenience\nand discomfort it will be to sleep in your clothes, and not to sleep in a house, and a thousand other\nmortifications contained in the oath of that old fool the Marquis of Mantua, which your worship is now\nwanting to revive? Let your worship observe that there are no men in armour travelling on any of these\nroads, nothing but mule-drivers and carters, who not only do not wear helmets, but perhaps never heard\ntell of them all their lives.\"\n\"Thou art wrong there,\" said Don Quixote, \"for we shall not have been above two hours among these\ncross-roads before we see more men in armour than came to Albraca to win the fair Angelica.\"\n\"Enough,\" said Sancho; \"so be it then, and God grant us success, and that the time for winning that island\nwhich is costing me so dear may soon come, and then let me die.\"\n\"I have already told thee, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"not to give thyself any uneasiness on that score;\nfor if an island should fail, there is the kingdom of Denmark, or of Sobradisa, which will fit thee as a ring\nfits the finger, and all the more that, being on terra firma, thou wilt all the better enjoy thyself. But let us\nleave that to its own time; see if thou hast anything for us to eat in those saddlebags, because we must\npresently go in quest of some castle where we may lodge to-night and make the balsam I told thee of, for I\nswear to thee by God, this ear is giving me great pain.\"\n\"I have here an onion and a little cheese and a few scraps of bread,\" said Sancho, \"but they are not\nvictuals fit for a valiant knight like your worship.\"\n-28\n\n\"How little thou knowest about it,\" answered Don Quixote; \"I would have thee to know, Sancho, that it is\nthe glory of knights-errant to go without eating for a month, and even when they do eat, that it should be\nof what comes first to hand; and this would have been clear to thee hadst thou read as many histories as I\nhave, for, though they are very many, among them all I have found no mention made of knights-errant\neating, unless by accident or at some sumptuous banquets prepared for them, and the rest of the time they\npassed in dalliance. And though it is plain they could not do without eating and performing all the other\nnatural functions, because, in fact, they were men like ourselves, it is plain too that, wandering as they did\nthe most part of their lives through woods and wilds and without a cook, their most usual fare would be\nrustic viands such as those thou now offer me; so that, friend Sancho, let not that distress thee which\npleases me, and do not seek to make a new world or pervert knight-errantry.\"\n\"Pardon me, your worship,\" said Sancho, \"for, as I cannot read or write, as I said just now, I neither know\nnor comprehend the rules of the profession of chivalry: henceforward I will stock the saddlebags with\nevery kind of dry fruit for your worship, as you are a knight; and for myself, as I am not one, I will\nfurnish them with poultry and other things more substantial.\"\n\"I do not say, Sancho,\" replied Don Quixote, \"that it is imperative on knights-errant not to eat anything\nelse but the fruits thou speakest of; only that their more usual diet must be those, and certain herbs they\nfound in the fields which they knew and I know too.\"\n\"A good thing it is,\" answered Sancho, \"to know those herbs, for to my thinking it will be needful some\nday to put that knowledge into practice.\"\nAnd here taking out what he said he had brought, the pair made their repast peaceably and sociably. But\nanxious to find quarters for the night, they with all despatch made an end of their poor dry fare, mounted\nat once, and made haste to reach some habitation before night set in; but daylight and the hope of\nsucceeding in their object failed them close by the huts of some goatherds, so they determined to pass the\nnight there, and it was as much to Sancho's discontent not to have reached a house, as it was to his\nmaster's satisfaction to sleep under the open heaven, for he fancied that each time this happened to him he\nperformed an act that helped to prove his kighthood.\nCHAPTER XI.\nWHAT BEFELL DON QUIXOTE WITH CERTAIN GOATHERDS\nHe was cordially welcomed by the goatherds, and Sancho, having as best he could put up Rocinante and\nthe ass, drew towards the fragrance that came from some pieces of salted goat simmering in a pot on the\nfire; and though he would have liked at once to try if they were ready to be transferred from the pot to the\nstomach, he refrained from doing so as the goatherds removed them from the fire, and laying sheepskins\non the ground, quickly spread their rude table, and with signs of hearty good-will invited them both to\nshare what they had. Round the skins six of the men belonging to the fold seated themselves, having first\nwith rough politeness pressed Don Quixote to take a seat upon a trough which they placed for him upside\ndown. Don Quixote seated himself, and Sancho remained standing to serve the cup, which was made of\nhorn. Seeing him standing, his master said to him:\n\"That thou mayest see, Sancho, the good that knight-errantry contains in itself, and how those who fill\nany office in it are on the high road to be speedily honoured and esteemed by the world, I desire that thou\nseat thyself here at my side and in the company of these worthy people, and that thou be one with me who\nam thy master and natural lord, and that thou eat from my plate and drink from whatever I drink from; for\nthe same may be said of knight-errantry as of love, that it levels all.\"\n-29\n\n\"Great thanks,\" said Sancho, \"but I may tell your worship that provided I have enough to eat, I can eat it\nas well, or better, standing, and by myself, than seated alongside of an emperor. And indeed, if the truth is\nto be told, what I eat in my corner without form or fuss has much more relish for me, even though it be\nbread and onions, than the turkeys of those other tables where I am forced to chew slowly, drink little,\nwipe my mouth every minute, and cannot sneeze or cough if I want or do other things that are the\nprivileges of liberty and solitude. So, senor, as for these honours which your worship would put upon me\nas a servant and follower of knight-errantry, exchange them for other things which may be of more use\nand advantage to me; for these, though I fully acknowledge them as received, I renounce from this\nmoment to the end of the world.\"\n\"For all that,\" said Don Quixote, \"thou must seat thyself, because him who humbleth himself God\nexalteth;\" and seizing him by the arm he forced him to sit down beside himself.\nThe goatherds did not understand this jargon about squires and knights-errant, and all they did was to eat\nin silence and stare at their guests, who with great elegance and appetite were stowing away pieces as big\nas one's fist. The course of meat finished, they spread upon the sheepskins a great heap of parched acorns,\nand with them they put down a half cheese harder than if it had been made of mortar. All this while the\nhorn was not idle, for it went round so constantly, now full, now empty, like the bucket of a water-wheel,\nthat it soon drained one of the two wine-skins that were in sight. When Don Quixote had quite appeased\nhis appetite he took up a handful of the acorns, and contemplating them attentively delivered himself\nsomewhat in this fashion:\n\"Happy the age, happy the time, to which the ancients gave the name of golden, not because in that\nfortunate age the gold so coveted in this our iron one was gained without toil, but because they that lived\nin it knew not the two words \"mine\" and \"thine\"! In that blessed age all things were in common; to win\nthe daily food no labour was required of any save to stretch forth his hand and gather it from the sturdy\noaks that stood generously inviting him with their sweet ripe fruit. The clear streams and running brooks\nyielded their savoury limpid waters in noble abundance. The busy and sagacious bees fixed their republic\nin the clefts of the rocks and hollows of the trees, offering without usance the plenteous produce of their\nfragrant toil to every hand. The mighty cork trees, unenforced save of their own courtesy, shed the broad\nlight bark that served at first to roof the houses supported by rude stakes, a protection against the\ninclemency of heaven alone. Then all was peace, all friendship, all concord; as yet the dull share of the\ncrooked plough had not dared to rend and pierce the tender bowels of our first mother that without\ncompulsion yielded from every portion of her broad fertile bosom all that could satisfy, sustain, and\ndelight the children that then possessed her. Then was it that the innocent and fair young shepherdess\nroamed from vale to vale and hill to hill, with flowing locks, and no more garments than were needful\nmodestly to cover what modesty seeks and ever sought to hide. Nor were their ornaments like those in use\nto-day, set off by Tyrian purple, and silk tortured in endless fashions, but the wreathed leaves of the green\ndock and ivy, wherewith they went as bravely and becomingly decked as our Court dames with all the\nrare and far-fetched artifices that idle curiosity has taught them. Then the love-thoughts of the heart\nclothed themselves simply and naturally as the heart conceived them, nor sought to commend themselves\nby forced and rambling expressions. Fraud, deceit, or malice had then not yet mingled with truth and\nsincerity. Justice held her ground, undisturbed and unassailed by the efforts of favour and of interest, that\nnow so much impair, pervert, and beset her. Arbitrary law had not yet established itself in the mind of the\njudge, for then there was no cause to judge and no one to be judged. Maidens and Innocence herself, as I\nhave said, wandered at will alone and unattended, without fear of insult from lawlessness or libertine\nassault, and if they were undone it was of their own will and pleasure. But now in this hateful age of ours\nnot one maiden is safe, not though some new labyrinth like that of Crete conceal and surround her; even\nthere the pestilence of love will make its way to her through chinks or on the air by the zeal of its\naccursed importunity, and, despite of her seclusion, lead her to ruin. Therefore, as time advanced and\nwickedness increased, the order of knights-errant was instituted, to defend maidens, to protect widows\n-30\n\nand to aid orphans and the needy. To this order I belong, brother goatherds, to whom I return thanks for\nthe hospitality and kindly welcome ye offer me and my squire; for though by natural law all living are\nbound to show favour to knights-errant, yet, seeing that without knowing this obligation you have\nwelcomed and feasted me, it is right that with all the good-will in my power I should thank you for\nyours.\"\nAll this long harangue (which might very well have been spared) our knight delivered because the acorns\nthey gave him reminded him of the golden age; and the whim seized him to address all this unnecessary\nargument to the goatherds, who listened to him gaping in amazement without saying a word in reply.\nSancho likewise held his peace and ate acorns, and paid repeated visits to the second wine-skin, which\nthey had hung up on a cork tree to keep the wine cool. As for Don Quixote, he was longer in talking than\nthe supper in finishing, at the end of which one of the goatherds said, \"That your worship, senor\nknight-errant, may say with more truth that we show you hospitality with ready good-will, we will give\nyou amusement and pleasure by making one of our comrades sing: he will be here before long, and he can\nplay on the rebeck to perfection.\" The goatherd had hardly done speaking, when the notes of the rebeck\nreached their ears; and shortly after, the player came up, a very good-looking young man of about\ntwo-and-twenty, who tuned his rebeck and sang to the company. When he brought his song to an end,\nDon Quixote entreated him to sing more, but Sancho had no mind that way, being more inclined for sleep\nthan for listening to songs; and so he said to his master, \"Your worship will do well to settle at once\nwhere you mean to pass the night, for the labour these good men are at all day does not allow them to\nspend the night in singing.\"\n\"I understand thee, Sancho,\" replied Don Quixote; \"I perceive clearly that those visits to the wine-skin\ndemand compensation in sleep rather than in music.\"\n\"It's sweet to us all, blessed be God,\" said Sancho.\n\"I do not deny it,\" replied Don Quixote; \"but settle thyself where thou wilt; it is better for those of my\nprofession to watch than to sleep; still it would be as well if thou wert to dress this ear for me again, for it\nis giving me more pain than it need.\"\nSancho did as he bade him, but one of the goatherds, seeing the wound, told him not to be uneasy, as he\nwould apply a remedy with which it would be soon healed; and gathering some leaves of rosemary, of\nwhich there was a great quantity there, he chewed them and mixed them with a little salt, and applying\nthem to the ear he secured them firmly with a bandage, assuring him that no other treatment would be\nrequired, and so it proved. . . . [Chapter XII is omitted.]\nCHAPTER XIII.\nWHICH IS OCCUPIED WITH FURTHER INCIDENTS\nHardly had the next day begun to show itself through the balconies of the east, when five of the six\ngoatherds came to rouse Don Quixote, who ordered Sancho to saddle horse and donkey at once, which he\ndid with all despatch, and with the same they set out forthwith. They had not gone a quarter of a league\nwhen at the meeting of two paths they saw coming towards them two gentlemen of quality on horseback\nin handsome travelling dress, with three servants on foot accompanying them. Courteous salutations were\nexchanged on meeting, and inquiring one of the other which way each party was going, they went on all\ntogether.\nOne of those on horseback who was called Vivaldo asked Don Quixote what was the reason that led him\nto go armed in a country so peaceful. To which Don Quixote replied, \"The pursuit of my calling does not\n-31\n\nallow or permit me to go in any other fashion; easy life, enjoyment, and repose were invented for soft\ncourtiers, but toil, unrest, and arms were invented and made for those alone whom the world calls\nknights-errant, of whom I, though unworthy, am the least of all.\" The instant they heard this all set him\ndown as mad, and the better to settle the point and discover what kind of madness his was, Vivaldo\nproceeded to ask him what he meant by knights-errant.\n\"Have not your worships,\" replied Don Quixote, \"read the annals and histories of England, in which are\nrecorded the famous deeds of King Arthur, whom we in our popular Castilian invariably call King Artus?\nThere is an ancient tradition commonly received all over that kingdom of Great Britain, that this king did\nnot die, but was changed by enchantment into a raven, and that in process of time he is to return to reign\nand recover his kingdom and sceptre; for which reason it cannot be proved that from that time to this any\nEnglishman ever killed a raven? Well, then, in the time of this good king that famous order of chivalry of\nthe Knights of the Round Table was instituted, and the loves of Sir Lancelot of the Lake and Queen\nGuinevere occurred, precisely as is there related, with all the sweet and delectable course of his\nachievements in love and war. Handed down from that time, then, this order of chivalry went on\nextending and spreading itself over many and various parts of the world; and in it, famous and renowned\nfor their deeds, were the mighty Amadis of Gaul with all his sons and descendants to the fifth generation,\nand the valiant Felixmarte of Hircania, and the never sufficiently praised Tirante the White, and in our\nown days almost we have seen and heard and talked with the invincible knight Don Belianis of Greece.\nThis, then, sirs, is what it means to be a knight-errant, and what I have spoken of is the order of chivalry,\nof which, as I have already said, I, though a sinner, have made profession, and what the aforesaid knights\nprofessed that same do I profess, and so I go through these solitudes and wilds seeking adventures,\nresolved in soul to oppose my arm and person to the most perilous that fortune may offer in aid of the\nweak and needy.\"\nBy these words the travellers were able to satisfy themselves of Don Quixote's being out of his senses\nand of the form of madness that overmastered him, at which they felt the same astonishment that all felt\non first becoming acquainted with it; and Vivaldo, who was a person of great shrewdness and of a lively\ntemperament, in order to beguile the short journey which they said was required to reach the mountain,\nthe scene of the burial, sought to give him an opportunity of going on with his absurdities. So he said to\nhim, \"It seems to me, Senor Knight-errant, that your worship has made choice of one of the most austere\nprofessions in the world, and I imagine even that of the Carthusian monks is not so austere.\"\n\"As austere it may perhaps be,\" replied our Don Quixote, \"but so necessary for the world I am very much\ninclined to doubt. For, if the truth is to be told, the soldier who executes what his captain orders does no\nless than the captain himself who gives the order. My meaning, is, that churchmen in peace and quiet pray\nto Heaven for the welfare of the world, but we soldiers and knights carry into effect what they pray for,\ndefending it with the might of our arms and the edge of our swords, not under shelter but in the open air, a\ntarget for the intolerable rays of the sun in summer and the piercing frosts of winter. Thus are we God's\nministers on earth and the arms by which his justice is done therein. And as the business of war and all\nthat relates and belongs to it cannot be conducted without exceeding great sweat, toil, and exertion, it\nfollows that those who make it their profession have undoubtedly more labour than those who in tranquil\npeace and quiet are engaged in praying to God to help the weak. I do not mean to say, nor does it enter\ninto my thoughts, that the knight-errant's calling is as good as that of the monk in his cell; I would merely\ninfer from what I endure myself that it is beyond a doubt a more laborious and a more belaboured one, a\nhungrier and thirstier, a wretcheder, raggeder, and lousier; for there is no reason to doubt that the\nknights-errant of yore endured much hardship in the course of their lives. And if some of them by the\nmight of their arms did rise to be emperors, in faith it cost them dear in the matter of blood and sweat; and\nif those who attained to that rank had not had enchanters and sages to help them they would have been\ncompletely baulked in their ambition and disappointed in their hopes.\"\n-32\n\n\"That is my own opinion,\" replied the traveller; \"but one thing among many others seems to me very\nwrong in knights-errant, and that is that when they find themselves about to engage in some mighty and\nperilous adventure in which there is manifest danger of losing their lives, they never at the moment of\nengaging in it think of commending themselves to God, as is the duty of every good Christian in like\nperil; instead of which they commend themselves to their ladies with as much devotion as if these were\ntheir gods, a thing which seems to me to savour somewhat of heathenism.\"\n\"Sir,\" answered Don Quixote, \"that cannot be on any account omitted, and the knight-errant would be\ndisgraced who acted otherwise: for it is usual and customary in knight-errantry that the knight-errant, who\non engaging in any great feat of arms has his lady before him, should turn his eyes towards her softly and\nlovingly, as though with them entreating her to favour and protect him in the hazardous venture he is\nabout to undertake, and even though no one hear him, he is bound to say certain words between his teeth,\ncommending himself to her with all his heart, and of this we have innumerable instances in the histories.\nNor is it to be supposed from this that they are to omit commending themselves to God, for there will be\ntime and opportunity for doing so while they are engaged in their task.\"\n\"For all that,\" answered the traveller, \"I feel some doubt still, because often I have read how words will\narise between two knights-errant, and from one thing to another it comes about that their anger kindles\nand they wheel their horses round and take a good stretch of field, and then without any more ado at the\ntop of their speed they come to the charge, and in mid-career they are wont to commend themselves to\ntheir ladies; and what commonly comes of the encounter is that one falls over the haunches of his horse\npierced through and through by his antagonist's lance, and as for the other, it is only by holding on to the\nmane of his horse that he can help falling to the ground; but I know not how the dead man had time to\ncommend himself to God in the course of such rapid work as this; it would have been better if those\nwords which he spent in commending himself to his lady in the midst of his career had been devoted to\nhis duty and obligation as a Christian. Moreover, it is my belief that all knights-errant have not ladies to\ncommend themselves to, for they are not all in love.\"\n\"That is impossible,\" said Don Quixote: \"I say it is impossible that there could be a knight-errant without\na lady, because to such it is as natural and proper to be in love as to the heavens to have stars: most\ncertainly no history has been seen in which there is to be found a knight-errant without an amour, and for\nthe simple reason that without one he would be held no legitimate knight but a bastard, and one who had\ngained entrance into the stronghold of the said knighthood, not by the door, but over the wall like a thief\nand a robber.\"\n\"Then if it be essential that every knight-errant should be in love,\" said the traveller, \"it may be fairly\nsupposed that your worship is so, as you are of the order; and if you do not pride yourself on being\nreticent, I entreat you as earnestly as I can, in the name of all this company and in my own, to inform us\nof the name, country, rank, and beauty of your lady, for she will esteem herself fortunate if all the world\nknows that she is loved and served by such a knight as your worship seems to be.\"\nAt this Don Quixote heaved a deep sigh and said, \"I cannot say positively whether my sweet enemy is\npleased or not that the world should know I serve her; I can only say in answer to what has been so\ncourteously asked of me, that her name is Dulcinea, her country El Toboso, a village of La Mancha, her\nrank must be at least that of a princess, since she is my queen and lady, and her beauty superhuman, since\nall the impossible and fanciful attributes of beauty which the poets apply to their ladies are verified in her;\nfor her hairs are gold, her forehead Elysian fields, her eyebrows rainbows, her eyes suns, her cheeks\nroses, her lips coral, her teeth pearls, her neck alabaster, her bosom marble, her hands ivory, her fairness\nsnow. As for those parts that modesty conceals from sight, they are as I think and imagine them, and\ndiscretion can only extol them, not make explicit comparison.\"\n-33\n\n\"We should like to know her lineage, race, and ancestry,\" said Vivaldo.\nTo which Don Quixote replied, \"She is not of the ancient Roman Curtii, Caii, or Scipios, nor of the\nmodern Colonnas or Orsini, nor of the Moncadas or Requesenes of Catalonia, nor yet of the Rebellas or\nVillanovas of Valencia; Palafoxes, Nuzas, Rocabertis, Corellas, Lunas, Alagones, Urreas, Foces, or\nGurreas of Aragon; Cerdas, Manriques, Mendozas, or Guzmans of Castile; Alencastros, Pallas, or\nMeneses of Portugal; but she is of those of El Toboso of La Mancha, a lineage that though modern, may\nfurnish a source of gentle blood for the most illustrious families of the ages that are to come, and this let\nnone dispute with me.\"\n\"Although mine is of the Cachopins of Laredo,\" said the traveller, \"I will not venture to compare it with\nthat of El Toboso of La Mancha, though, to tell the truth, no such surname has until now ever reached my\nears.\"\n\"What!\" said Don Quixote, \"That never reached them?\"\nThe rest of the party went along listening with great attention to the conversation of the pair, and\nperceived how exceedingly out of his wits our Don Quixote was. Sancho Panza alone thought that what\nhis master said was the truth, knowing who he was and having known him from his birth; and all that he\nfelt any difficulty in believing was that about the fair Dulcinea del Toboso, because neither any such\nname nor any such princess had ever come to his knowledge though he lived so close to El Toboso.\n[The bulk of Chapter XIV is omitted.]\nSoon, the travellers parted ways. Vivaldo and his companion pressed Don Quixote to come with them to\nSeville, as being such a convenient place for finding adventures, for they presented themselves in every\nstreet and round every corner oftener than anywhere else. Don Quixote thanked them for their advice and\nfor the disposition they showed to do him a favour, and said that for the present he would not, and must\nnot go to Seville until he had cleared all these mountains of highwaymen and robbers, of whom report\nsaid they were full. Seeing his good intention, the travellers were unwilling to press him further, and once\nmore bidding him farewell, they left him and pursued their journey, in the course of which they did not\nfail to discuss the madness of Don Quixote. He, on his part, went another way, as is related in the course\nof this veracious history, of which the Second Part ends here.\nCHAPTER XV.\nIN WHICH IS RELATED THE UNFORTUNATE ADVENTURE THAT DON QUIXOTE FELL IN\nWITH WHEN HE FELL OUT WITH CERTAIN HEARTLESS YANGUESANS\nThe sage Cide Hamete Benengeli relates that as soon as Don Quixote took leave of his hosts, he and his\nsquire passed into a wood and came to a halt in a glade covered with tender grass, beside which ran a\npleasant cool stream that invited and compelled them to pass there the hours of the noontide heat, which\nby this time was beginning to come on oppressively. Don Quixote and Sancho dismounted, and turning\nRocinante and the ass loose to feed on the grass that was there in abundance, they ransacked the\nsaddlebags, and without any ceremony very peacefully and sociably master and man made their repast on\nwhat they found in them.\nSancho had not thought it worth while to hobble Rocinante, feeling sure, from what he knew of his\nstaidness and freedom from incontinence, that all the mares in the Cordova pastures would not lead him\ninto an impropriety. Chance, however, and the devil, who is not always asleep, so ordained it that feeding\nin this valley there was a drove of Galician ponies belonging to certain Yanguesan mule-drivers, whose\n-34\n\nway it is to take their midday rest with their teams in places and spots where grass and water abound; and\nthat where Don Quixote chanced to be suited the Yanguesans' purpose very well. It so happened, then,\nthat Rocinante took a fancy to disport himself with their ladyships the ponies, and abandoning his usual\ngait and demeanour as he scented them, he, without asking leave of his master, got up a briskish little trot\nand hastened to make known his wishes to them; they, however, it seemed, preferred their pasture to him,\nand received him with their heels and teeth to such effect that they soon broke his girths and left him\nnaked without a saddle to cover him; but what must have been worse to him was that the mule-drivers,\nseeing the violence he was offering to their mares, came running up armed with stakes, and so belaboured\nhim that they brought him sorely battered to the ground.\nBy this time Don Quixote and Sancho, who had witnessed the drubbing of Rocinante, came up panting,\nand said Don Quixote to Sancho:\n\"So far as I can see, friend Sancho, these are not knights but base folk of low birth: I mention it because\nthou canst lawfully aid me in taking due vengeance for the insult offered to Rocinante before our eyes.\"\n\"What the devil vengeance can we take,\" answered Sancho, \"if they are more than twenty, and we no\nmore than two, or, indeed, perhaps not more than one and a half?\"\n\"I count for a hundred,\" replied Don Quixote, and without more words he drew his sword and attacked\nthe Yanguesans and excited and impelled by the example of his master, Sancho did the same; and to\nbegin with, Don Quixote delivered a slash at one of them that laid open the leather jerkin he wore,\ntogether with a great portion of his shoulder. The Yanguesans, seeing themselves assaulted by only two\nmen while they were so many, betook themselves to their stakes, and driving the two into the middle they\nbegan to lay on with great zeal and energy; in fact, at the second blow they brought Sancho to the ground,\nand Don Quixote fared the same way, all his skill and high mettle availing him nothing, and fate willed it\nthat he should fall at the feet of Rocinante, who had not yet risen; whereby it may be seen how furiously\nstakes can pound in angry rustic hands.\nSeeing the mischief they had done, the Yanguesans with all the haste they could loaded their team and\npursued their journey, leaving the two adventurers a sorry sight and in sorrier mood.\nSancho was the first to come to, and finding himself close to his master he called to him in a weak and\ndoleful voice, \"Senor Don Quixote, ah, Senor Don Quixote!\"\n\"What wouldst thou, brother Sancho?\" answered Don Quixote in the same feeble suffering tone as\nSancho.\n\"I would like, if it were possible,\" answered Sancho Panza, \"your worship to give me a couple of sups of\nthat potion of that fiery Blas, if you have any within reach; perhaps it will serve for broken bones as well\nas for wounds.\"\n\"If I only had it here, wretch that I am, what more should we want?\" said Don Quixote; \"but I swear to\nthee, Sancho Panza, on the faith of a knight-errant, ere two days are over, unless fortune orders otherwise,\nI mean to have it in my possession, or my hand will have lost its cunning.\"\n\"But in how many days does your worship think we shall have the use of our feet?\" answered Sancho\nPanza.\n\"For myself I must say I cannot guess how many,\" said the battered knight Don Quixote; \"but I take all\nthe blame upon myself, for I had no business to put hand to sword against men who where not dubbed\n-35\n\nknights like myself, and so I believe that in punishment for having transgressed the laws of chivalry the\nGod of battles has permitted this chastisement to be administered to me; for which reason, brother\nSancho, it is well thou shouldst receive a hint on the matter which I am now about to mention to thee, for\nit is of much importance to the welfare of both of us. It is at when thou shalt see rabble of this sort\noffering us insult thou art not to wait till I draw sword against them, for I shall not do so at all; but do\nthou draw sword and chastise them to thy heart's content, and if any knights come to their aid and\ndefence I will take care to defend thee and assail them with all my might; and thou hast already seen by a\nthousand signs and proofs what the might of this strong arm of mine is equal to\"--so uplifted had the poor\ngentleman become through the victory over the stout Biscayan.\nBut Sancho did not so fully approve of his master's admonition as to let it pass without saying in reply,\n\"Senor, I am a man of peace, meek and quiet, and I can put up with any affront because I have a wife and\nchildren to support and bring up; so let it be likewise a hint to your worship, as it cannot be a mandate,\nthat on no account will I draw sword either against clown or against knight, and that here before God I\nforgive the insults that have been offered me, whether they have been, are, or shall be offered me by high\nor low, rich or poor, noble or commoner, not excepting any rank or condition whatsoever.\"\nTo all which his master said in reply, \"I wish I had breath enough to speak somewhat easily, and that the\npain I feel on this side would abate so as to let me explain to thee, Panza, the mistake thou makest. Come\nnow, sinner, suppose the wind of fortune, hitherto so adverse, should turn in our favour, filling the sails of\nour desires so that safely and without impediment we put into port in some one of those islands I have\npromised thee, how would it be with thee if on winning it I made thee lord of it? Why, thou wilt make it\nwell-nigh impossible through not being a knight nor having any desire to be one, nor possessing the\ncourage nor the will to avenge insults or defend thy lordship; for thou must know that in newly conquered\nkingdoms and provinces the minds of the inhabitants are never so quiet nor so well disposed to the new\nlord that there is no fear of their making some move to change matters once more, and try, as they say,\nwhat chance may do for them; so it is essential that the new possessor should have good sense to enable\nhim to govern, and valour to attack and defend himself, whatever may befall him.\"\n\"In what has now befallen us,\" answered Sancho, \"I'd have been well pleased to have that good sense and\nthat valour your worship speaks of, but I swear on the faith of a poor man I am more fit for plasters than\nfor arguments. See if your worship can get up, and let us help Rocinante, though he does not deserve it,\nfor he was the main cause of all this thrashing. I never thought it of Rocinante, for I took him to be a\nvirtuous person and as quiet as myself. After all, they say right that it takes a long time to come to know\npeople, and that there is nothing sure in this life. Who would have said that, after such mighty slashes as\nyour\nworship gave that unlucky knight-errant, there was coming, travelling post and at the very heels of them,\nsuch a great storm of sticks as has fallen upon our shoulders?\"\n\"And yet thine, Sancho,\" replied Don Quixote, \"ought to be used to such squalls; but mine, reared in soft\ncloth and fine linen, it is plain they must feel more keenly the pain of this mishap, and if it were not that I\nimagine--why do I say imagine?--know of a certainty that all these annoyances are very necessary\naccompaniments of the calling of arms, I would lay me down here to die of pure vexation.\"\nTo this the squire replied, \"Senor, as these mishaps are what one reaps of chivalry, tell me if they happen\nvery often, or if they have their own fixed times for coming to pass; because it seems to me that after two\nharvests we shall be no good for the third, unless God in his infinite mercy helps us.\"\n\"Know, friend Sancho,\" answered Don Quixote, \"that the life of knights-errant is subject to a thousand\ndangers and reverses, and neither more nor less is it within immediate possibility for knights-errant to\nbecome kings and emperors, as experience has shown in the case of many different knights with whose\n-36\n\nhistories I am thoroughly acquainted; and I could tell thee now, if the pain would let me, of some who\nsimply by might of arm have risen to the high stations I have mentioned; and those same, both before and\nafter, experienced divers misfortunes and miseries; for the valiant Amadis of Gaul found himself in the\npower of his mortal enemy Arcalaus the enchanter, who, it is positively asserted, holding him captive,\ngave him more than two hundred lashes with the reins of his horse while tied to one of the pillars of a\ncourt; and moreover there is a certain recondite author of no small authority who says that the Knight of\nPhoebus, being caught in a certain pitfall, which opened under his feet in a certain castle, on falling found\nhimself bound hand and foot in a deep pit underground, where they administered to him one of those\nthings they call clysters, of sand and snow-water, that well-nigh finished him; and if he had not been\nsuccoured in that sore extremity by a sage, a great friend of his, it would have gone very hard with the\npoor knight; so I may well suffer in company with such worthy folk, for greater were the indignities\nwhich they had to suffer than those which we suffer. For I would have thee know, Sancho, that wounds\ncaused by any instruments which happen by chance to be in hand inflict no indignity, and this is laid\ndown in the law of the duel in express words: if, for instance, the cobbler strikes another with the last\nwhich he has in his hand, though it be in fact a piece of wood, it cannot be said for that reason that he\nwhom he struck with it has been cudgelled. I say this lest thou shouldst imagine that because we have\nbeen drubbed in this affray we have therefore suffered any indignity; for the arms those men carried, with\nwhich they pounded us, were nothing more than their stakes, and not one of them, so far as I remember,\ncarried rapier, sword, or dagger.\"\n\"They gave me no time to see that much,\" answered Sancho, \"for hardly had I laid hand on my tizona\nwhen they signed the cross on my shoulders with their sticks in such style that they took the sight out of\nmy eyes and the strength out of my feet, stretching me where I now lie, and where thinking of whether all\nthose stake-strokes were an indignity or not gives me no uneasiness, which the pain of the blows does, for\nthey will remain as deeply impressed on my memory as on my shoulders.\"\n\"For all that let me tell thee, brother Panza,\" said Don Quixote, \"that there is no recollection which time\ndoes not put an end to, and no pain which death does not remove.\"\n\"And what greater misfortune can there be,\" replied Panza, \"than the one that waits for time to put an end\nto it and death to remove it? If our mishap were one of those that are cured with a couple of plasters, it\nwould not be so bad; but I am beginning to think that all the plasters in a hospital almost won't be enough\nto put us right.\"\n\"No more of that: pluck strength out of weakness, Sancho, as I mean to do,\" returned Don Quixote, \"and\nlet us see how Rocinante is, for it seems to me that not the least share of this mishap has fallen to the lot\nof the poor beast.\"\n\"There is nothing wonderful in that,\" replied Sancho, \"since he is a knight-errant too; what I wonder at is\nthat my beast should have come off scot-free where we come out scotched.\"\n\"Fortune always leaves a door open in adversity in order to bring relief to it,\" said Don Quixote; \"I say so\nbecause this little beast may now supply the want of Rocinante, carrying me hence to some castle where I\nmay be cured of my wounds. And moreover I shall not hold it any dishonour to be so mounted, for I\nremember having read how the good old Silenus, the tutor and instructor of the gay god of laughter, when\nhe entered the city of the hundred gates, went very contentedly mounted on a handsome ass.\"\n\"It may be true that he went mounted as your worship says,\" answered Sancho, \"but there is a great\ndifference between going mounted and going slung like a sack of manure.\"\nTo which Don Quixote replied, \"Wounds received in battle confer honour instead of taking it away; and\n-37\n\nso, friend Panza, say no more, but, as I told thee before, get up as well as thou canst and put me on top of\nthy beast in whatever fashion pleases thee best, and let us go hence ere night come on and surprise us in\nthese wilds.\"\n\"And yet I have heard your worship say,\" observed Panza, \"that it is very meet for knights-errant to sleep\nin wastes and deserts, and that they esteem it very good fortune.\"\n\"That is,\" said Don Quixote, \"when they cannot help it, or when they are in love; and so true is this that\nthere have been knights who have remained two years on rocks, in sunshine and shade and all the\ninclemencies of heaven, without their ladies knowing anything of it; and one of these was Amadis, when,\nunder the name of Beltenebros, he took up his abode on the Pena Pobre for--I know not if it was eight\nyears or eight months, for I am not very sure of the reckoning; at any rate he stayed there doing penance\nfor I know not what pique the Princess Oriana had against him; but no more of this now, Sancho, and\nmake haste before a mishap like Rocinante's befalls the ass.\"\n\"The very devil would be in it in that case,\" said Sancho; and letting off thirty \"ohs,\" and sixty sighs, and\na hundred and twenty maledictions and execrations on whomsoever it was that had brought him there, he\nraised himself, stopping half-way bent like a Turkish bow without power to bring himself upright, but\nwith all his pains he saddled his ass, who too had gone astray somewhat, yielding to the excessive licence\nof the day; he next raised up Rocinante, and as for him, had he possessed a tongue to complain with, most\nassuredly neither Sancho nor his master would have been behind him.\nTo be brief, Sancho fixed Don Quixote on the ass and secured Rocinante with a leading rein, and taking\nthe ass by the halter, he proceeded more or less in the direction in which it seemed to him the high road\nmight be; and, as chance was conducting their affairs for them from good to better, he had not gone a\nshort league when the road came in sight, and on it he perceived an inn, which to his annoyance and to the\ndelight of Don Quixote must needs be a castle. Sancho insisted that it was an inn, and his master that it\nwas not one, but a castle, and the dispute lasted so long that before the point was settled they had time to\nreach it, and into it Sancho entered with all his team without any further argument.\nCHAPTER XVI.\nOF WHAT HAPPENED TO THE INGENIOUS GENTLEMAN IN THE INN WHICH HE TOOK TO\nBE A CASTLE\nThe innkeeper, seeing Don Quixote slung across the ass, asked Sancho what was amiss with him. Sancho\nanswered that it was nothing, only that he had fallen down from a rock and had his ribs a little bruised.\nThe innkeeper had a wife whose disposition was not such as those of her calling commonly have, for she\nwas by nature kind-hearted and felt for the sufferings of her neighbours, so she at once set about tending\nDon Quixote, and made her young daughter, a very comely girl, help her in taking care of her guest.\nThere was besides in the inn, as servant, an Asturian lass with a broad face, flat poll, and snub nose, blind\nof one eye and not very sound in the other. The elegance of her shape, to be sure, made up for all her\ndefects; she did not measure seven palms from head to foot, and her shoulders, which overweighted her\nsomewhat, made her contemplate the ground more than she liked. This graceful lass, then, helped the\nyoung girl, and the two made up a very bad bed for Don Quixote in a garret that showed evident signs of\nhaving formerly served for many years as a straw-loft, in which there was also quartered a mule-driver\nwhose bed was placed a little beyond our Don Quixote's, and, though only made of the pack-saddles and\ncloths of his mules, had much the advantage of it, as Don Quixote's consisted simply of four rough\nboards on two not very even trestles, a mattress, that for thinness might have passed for a quilt, full of\npellets which, were they not seen through the rents to be wool, would to the touch have seemed pebbles in\nhardness, two sheets made of buckler leather, and a coverlet the threads of which anyone that chose might\n-38\n\nhave counted without missing one in the reckoning.\nOn this accursed bed Don Quixote stretched himself, and the hostess and her daughter soon covered him\nwith plasters from top to toe, while Maritornes--for that was the name of the Asturian--held the light for\nthem, and while plastering him, the hostess, observing how full of wheals Don Quixote was in some\nplaces, remarked that this had more the look of blows than of a fall.\nIt was not blows, Sancho said, but that the rock had many points and projections, and that each of them\nhad left its mark. \"Pray, senora,\" he added, \"manage to save some tow, as there will be no want of some\none to use it, for my loins too are rather sore.\"\n\"Then you must have fallen too,\" said the hostess.\n\"I did not fall,\" said Sancho Panza, \"but from the shock I got at seeing my master fall, my body aches so\nthat I feel as if I had had a thousand thwacks.\"\n\"That may well be,\" said the young girl, \"for it has many a time happened to me to dream that I was\nfalling down from a tower and never coming to the ground, and when I awoke from the dream to find\nmyself as weak and shaken as if I had really fallen.\"\n\"There is the point, senora,\" replied Sancho Panza, \"that I without dreaming at all, but being more awake\nthan I am now, find myself with scarcely less wheals than my master, Don Quixote.\"\n\"How is the gentleman called?\" asked Maritornes the Asturian.\n\"Don Quixote of La Mancha,\" answered Sancho Panza, \"and he is a knight-errant, and one of the best and\nstoutest that have been seen in the world this long time past.\"\n\"What is a knight-errant?\" said the lass.\n\"Are you so new in the world as not to know?\" answered Sancho Panza. \"Well, then, you must know,\nsister, that a knight-errant is a thing that in two words is cudgeled and emperor, that is to-day the most\nmiserable and needy being in the world, and to-morrow will have two or three kngdoms to give away to\nhis squire.\"\n\"Then how is it,\" said the hostess, \"that belonging to so good a master as this, you have not, to judge by\nappearances, even so much as a county?\"\n\"It is too soon yet,\" answered Sancho, \"for we have only been a month going in quest of adventures, and\nso far we have met with nothing that can be called one, for it will happen that when one thing is looked\nfor another thing is found; however, if my master Don Quixote gets well of this wound, or fall, and I am\nleft none the worse of it, I would not change my hopes for the best title in Spain.\"\nTo all this conversation Don Quixote was listening very attentively, and sitting up in bed as well as he\ncould, and taking the hostess by the hand he said to her, \"Believe me, fair lady, you may call yourself\nfortunate in having in this castle of yours sheltered my person, which is such that if I do not myself praise\nit, it is because of what is commonly said, that self-praise debaseth; but my squire will inform you who I\nam. I only tell you that I shall preserve for ever inscribed on my memory the service you have rendered\nme in order to tender you my gratitude while life shall last me; and would to Heaven love held me not so\nenthralled and subject to its laws and to the eyes of that fair ingrate whom I name between my teeth, but\nthat those of this lovely damsel might be the masters of my liberty.\"\n-39\n\nThe hostess, her daughter, and the worthy Maritornes listened in bewilderment to the words of the\nknight-errant; for they understood about as much of them as if he had been talking Greek, though they\ncould perceive they were all meant for expressions of good-will and blandishments; and not being\naccustomed to this kind of language, they stared at him and wondered to themselves, for he seemed to\nthem a man of a different sort from those they were used to, and thanking him in pothouse phrase for his\ncivility they left him, while the Asturian gave her attention to Sancho, who needed it no less than his\nmaster.\nThe mule-driver had made an arrangement with her for recreation that night, and she had given him her\nword that when the guests were quiet and the family asleep she would come in search of him and meet his\nwishes unreservedly. And it is said of this good lass that she never made promises of the kind without\nfulfilling them, even though she made them in a forest and without any witness present, for she plumed\nherself greatly on being a lady and held it no disgrace to be in such an employment as servant in an inn,\nbecause, she said, misfortunes and ill-luck had brought her to that position. The hard, narrow, wretched,\nrickety bed of Don Quixote stood first in the middle of this star-lit stable, and close beside it Sancho made\nhis, which merely consisted of a rush mat and a blanket that looked as if it was of threadbare canvas\nrather than of wool. Next to these two beds was that of the mule-driver, made up, as has been said, of the\npack-saddles and all the trappings of the two best mules he had, though there were twelve of them, sleek,\nplump, and in prime condition, for he was one of the rich mule-drivers of Arevalo, according to the author\nof this history, who particularly mentions this mule-driver because he knew him very well, and they even\nsay was in some degree a relation of his; besides which Cide Hamete Benengeli was a historian of great\nresearch and accuracy in all things, as is very evident since he would not pass over in silence those that\nhave been already mentioned, however trifling and insignificant they might be, an example that might be\nfollowed by those grave historians who relate transactions so curtly and briefly that we hardly get a taste\nof them, all the petty details of the history being left in the inkstand from carelessness, perverseness, or\nignorance. A thousand blessings on the author of \"Tablante de Ricamonte\" and that of that other book in\nwhich the deeds of the Conde Tomillas are recounted; with what minuteness they describe everything!\nTo proceed, then: after having paid a visit to his team and given them their second feed, the mule-driver\nstretched himself on his pack-saddles and lay waiting for his conscientious Maritornes. Sancho was by\nthis time plastered and had lain down, and though he strove to sleep the pain of his ribs would not let him,\nwhile Don Quixote with the pain of his had his eyes as wide open as a hare's.\nThe inn was all in silence, and in the whole of it there was no light except that given by a lantern that\nhung burning in the middle of the gateway. This strange stillness, and the thoughts, always present to our\nknight's mind, of the incidents described at every turn in the books that were the cause of his misfortune,\nconjured up to his imagination as extraordinary a delusion as can well be conceived, which was that he\nfancied himself to have reached a famous castle (for, as has been said, all the inns he lodged in were\ncastles to his eyes), and that the daughter of the innkeeper was daughter of the lord of the castle, and that\nshe, won by his high-bred bearing, had fallen in love with him, and had promised to come to his bed for a\nwhile that night without the knowledge of her parents; and holding all this fantasy that he had constructed\nas solid fact, he began to feel uneasy and to consider the perilous risk which his virtue was about to\nencounter, and he resolved in his heart to commit no treason to his lady Dulcinea del Toboso, even\nthough the queen Guinevere herself and the dame Quintanona should present themselves before him.\nWhile he was taken up with these vagaries, then, the time and the hour--an unlucky one for him--arrived\nfor the Asturian to come, who in her smock, with bare feet and her hair gathered into a fustian coif, with\nnoiseless and cautious steps entered the chamber where the three were quartered, in quest of the mule-\ndriver; but scarcely had she gained the door when Don Quixote perceived her, and sitting up in his bed in\nspite of his plasters and the pain of his ribs, he stretched out his arms to receive his beauteous damsel. The\nAsturian, who went all doubled up and in silence with her hands before her feeling for her lover,\n-40\n\nencountered the arms of Don Quixote, who grasped her tightly by the wrist, and drawing her towards him,\nwhile she dared not utter a word, made her sit down on the bed. He then felt her smock, and although it\nwas of sackcloth it appeared to him to be of the finest and softest silk: on her wrists she wore some glass\nbeads, but to him they had the sheen of precious Orient pearls: her hair, which in some measure\nresembled a horse's mane, he rated as threads of the brightest gold of Araby, whose refulgence dimmed\nthe sun himself: her breath, which no doubt smelt of yesterday's stale salad, seemed to him to diffuse a\nsweet aromatic fragrance from her mouth; and, in short, he drew her portrait in his imagination with the\nsame features and in the same style as that which he had seen in his books of the other princesses who,\nsmitten by love, came with all the adornments that are here set down, to see the sorely wounded knight;\nand so great was the poor gentleman's blindness that neither touch, nor smell, nor anything else about the\ngood lass that would have made any but a mule-driver vomit, were enough to undeceive him; on the\ncontrary, he was persuaded he had the goddess of beauty in his arms, and holding her firmly in his grasp\nhe went on to say in low, tender voice:\n\"Would that found myself, lovely and exalted lady, in a position to repay such a favour as that which you,\nby the sight of your great beauty, have granted me; but fortune, which is never weary of persecuting the\ngood, has chosen to place me upon this bed, where I lie so bruised and broken that though my inclination\nwould gladly comply with yours it is impossible; besides, to this impossibility another yet greater is to be\nadded, which is the faith that I have pledged to the peerless Dulcinea del Toboso, sole lady of my most\nsecret thoughts; and were it not that this stood in the way I should not be so insensible a knight as to miss\nthe happy opportunity which your great goodness has offered me.\"\nMaritornes was fretting and sweating at finding herself held so fast by Don Quixote, and not\nunderstanding or heeding the words he addressed to her, she strove without speaking to free herself. The\nworthy mule-driver, whose unholy thoughts kept him awake, was aware of his doxy the moment she\nentered the door, and was listening attentively to all Don Quixote said; and jealous that the Asturian\nshould have broken her word with him for another, drew nearer to Don Quixote's bed and stood still to\nsee what would come of this talk which he could not understand; but when he perceived the wench\nstruggling to get free and Don Quixote striving to hold her, not relishing the joke he raised his arm and\ndelivered such a terrible cuff on the lank jaws of the amorous knight that he bathed all his mouth in blood,\nand not content with this he mounted on his ribs and with his feet tramped all over them at a pace rather\nsmarter than a trot. The bed which was somewhat crazy and not very firm on its feet, unable to support\nthe additional weight of the mule-driver, came to the ground, and at the mighty crash of this the innkeeper\nawoke and at once concluded that it must be some brawl of Maritornes', because after calling loudly to\nher he got no answer. With this suspicion he got up, and lighting a lamp hastened to the quarter where he\nhad heard the disturbance. The wench, seeing that her master was coming and knowing that his temper\nwas terrible, frightened and panic-stricken made for the bed of Sancho Panza, who still slept, and\ncrouching upon it made a ball of herself.\nThe innkeeper came in exclaiming, \"Where art thou, strumpet? Of course this is some of thy work.\" At\nthis Sancho awoke, and feeling this mass almost on top of him fancied he had the nightmare and began to\ndistribute fisticuffs all round, of which a certain share fell upon Maritornes, who, irritated by the pain and\nflinging modesty aside, paid back so many in return to Sancho that she woke him up in spite of himself.\nHe then, finding himself so handled, by whom he knew not, raising himself up as well as he could,\ngrappled with Maritornes, and he and she between them began the bitterest and drollest scrimmage in the\nworld. The mule-driver, however, perceiving by the light of the innkeeper candle how it fared with his\nladylove, quitting Don Quixote, ran to bring her the help she needed; and the innkeeper did the same but\nwith a different intention, for his was to chastise the lass, as he believed that beyond a doubt she alone\nwas the cause of all the harmony. And so, as the saying is, cat to rat, rat to rope, rope to stick, the mule-\ndriver pounded Sancho, Sancho the lass, she him, and the innkeeper her, and all worked away so briskly\nthat they did not give themselves a moment's rest; and the best of it was that the innkeeper's lamp went\n-41\n\nout, and as they were left in the dark they all laid on one upon the other in a mass so unmercifully that\nthere was not a sound spot left where a hand could light.\nIt so happened that there was lodging that night in the inn an officer of what they call the Old Holy\nBrotherhood of Toledo1, who, also hearing the extraordinary noise of the conflict, seized his staff and the\ntin case with his warrants, and made his way in the dark into the room crying: \"Hold! in the name of the\nJurisdiction! Hold! in the name of the Holy Brotherhood!\"\nThe first that he came upon was the pummelled Don Quixote, who lay stretched senseless on his back\nupon his broken-down bed, and, his hand falling on the beard as he felt about, he continued to cry, \"Help\nfor the Jurisdiction!\" but perceiving that he whom he had laid hold of did not move or stir, he concluded\nthat he was dead and that those in the room were his murderers, and with this suspicion he raised his\nvoice still higher, calling out, \"Shut the inn gate; see that no one goes out; they have killed a man here!\"\nThis cry startled them all, and each dropped the contest at the point at which the voice reached him. The\ninnkeeper retreated to his room, the mule-driver to his pack-saddles, the lass to her crib; the unlucky Don\nQuixote and Sancho alone were unable to move from where they were. The officer on this let go Don\nQuixote's beard, and went out to look for a light to search for and apprehend the culprits; but not finding\none, as the innkeeper had purposely extinguished the lantern on retreating to his room, he was compelled\nto have recourse to the hearth, where after much time and trouble he lit another lamp.\nCHAPTER XVII.\nIN WHICH ARE CONTAINED THE INNUMERABLE TROUBLES WHICH THE BRAVE DON\nQUIXOTE AND HIS GOOD SQUIRE SANCHO PANZA ENDURED IN THE INN, WHICH TO HIS\nMISFORTUNE HE TOOK TO BE A CASTLE\nBy this time Don Quixote had recovered from his swoon; and in the same\ntone of voice in which he had called to his squire the day before when he lay stretched \"in the vale of the\nstakes,\" he began calling to him now, \"Sancho, my friend, art thou asleep? sleepest thou, friend Sancho?\"\n\"How can I sleep, curses on it!\" returned Sancho discontentedly and bitterly, \"when it is plain that all the\ndevils have been at me this night?\"\n\"Thou mayest well believe that,\" answered Don Quixote, \"because, either I know little, or this castle is\nenchanted, for thou must know-but this that I am now about to tell thee thou must swear to keep secret\nuntil after my death.\"\n\"I swear it,\" answered Sancho.\n\"I say so,\" continued Don Quixote, \"because I hate taking away anyone's good name.\"\n\"I say,\" replied Sancho, \"that I swear to hold my tongue about it till the end of your worship's days, and\nGod grant I may be able to let it out tomorrow.\"\n\"Do I do thee such injuries, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"that thou wouldst see me dead so soon?\"\n1A roving officer of law, somewhat analogous to the Texas Rangers before the accession of Texas\nto the Union.\n-42\n\n\"It is not for that,\" replied Sancho, \"but because I hate keeping things long, and I don't want them to\ngrow rotten with me from over-keeping.\"\n\"At any rate,\" said Don Quixote, \"I have more confidence in thy affection and good nature; and so I\nwould have thee know that this night there befell me one of the strangest adventures that I could describe,\nand to relate it to thee briefly thou must know that a little while ago the daughter of the lord of this castle\ncame to me, and that she is the most elegant and beautiful damsel that could be found in the wide world.\nWhat I could tell thee of the charms of her person! of her lively wit! of other secret matters which, to\npreserve the fealty I owe to my lady Dulcinea del Toboso, I shall pass over unnoticed and in silence! I\nwill only tell thee that, either fate being envious of so great a boon placed in my hands by good fortune,\nor perhaps (and this is more probable) this castle being, as I have already said, enchanted, at the time\nwhen I was engaged in the sweetest and most amorous discourse with her, there came, without my seeing\nor knowing whence it came, a hand attached to some arm of some huge giant, that planted such a cuff on\nmy jaws that I have them all bathed in blood, and then pummelled me in such a way that I am in a worse\nplight than yesterday when the mule-drivers, on account of Rocinante's misbehaviour, inflicted on us the\ninjury thou knowest of; whence conjecture that there must be some Moorish enchanter guarding the\ntreasure of this damsel's beauty, and that she is not reserved for me.\"\n\"Not for me either,\" said Sancho, \"for more than four hundred Moors have so thrashed me that the\ndrubbing of the stakes was cakes and fancy-bread to it. But tell me, senor, what do you call this excellent\nand rare adventure that has left us as we are left now? Though your worship was not so badly off, having\nin your arms that incomparable beauty you spoke of; but I, what did I have, except the heaviest whacks I\nthink I had in all my life? Unlucky me and the mother that bore me! for I am not a knight-errant and never\nexpect to be one, and of all the mishaps, the greater part falls to my share.\"\n\"Then thou hast been thrashed too?\" said Don Quixote.\n\"Didn't I say so? worse luck to my line!\" said Sancho.\n\"Be not distressed, friend,\" said Don Quixote, \"for I will now make the precious balsam with which we\nshall cure ourselves in the twinkling of an eye.\"\nBy this time the officer had succeeded in lighting the lamp, and came in to see the man that he thought\nhad been killed; and as Sancho caught sight of him at the door, seeing him coming in his shirt, with a\ncloth on his head, and a lamp in his hand, and a very forbidding countenance, he said to his master,\n\"Senor, can it be that this is the Moorish enchanter coming back to give us more castigation if there be\nanything still left in the ink-bottle?\"\n\"It cannot be the Moor,\" answered Don Quixote, \"for enchanters do not let themselves be seen by\nanyone.\"\n\"If they don't let themselves be seen, they let themselves be felt,\" said Sancho; \"if not, let my shoulders\nspeak to the point.\"\n\"Mine could speak too,\" said Don Quixote, \"but that is not a sufficient reason for believing that what we\nsee is the wizard Moor.\"\nThe officer came up, and finding them engaged in such a peaceful conversation, stood amazed; though\nDon Quixote, to be sure, still lay on his back unable to move from pure pummelling and plasters. The\nofficer turned to him and said, \"Well, how goes it, good man?\"\n-43\n\n\"I would speak more politely if I were you,\" replied Don Quixote; \"is it the way of this country to address\nknights-errant in that style, you booby?\"\nThe officer finding himself so disrespectfully treated by such a sorry-looking individual, lost his temper,\nand raising the lamp full of oil, smote Don Quixote such a blow with it on the head that he gave him a\nbadly broken pate; then, all being in darkness, he went out, and Sancho Panza said, \"That is certainly the\nenchanted Moor, Senor, and he keeps the treasure for others, and for us only the cuffs and lamp-whacks.\"\n\"That is the truth,\" answered Don Quixote, \"and there is no use in troubling oneself about these matters of\nenchantment or being angry or vexed at them, for as they are invisible and visionary we shall find no one\non whom to avenge ourselves, do what we may; rise, Sancho, if thou canst, and call the Governor of this\nfortress, and get him to give me a little oil, wine, salt, and rosemary to make the salutiferous balsam, for\nindeed I believe I have great need of it now, because I am losing much blood from the wound that\nphantom gave me.\"\nSancho got up with pain enough in his bones, and went after the innkeeper in the dark, and meeting the\nofficer, who was looking to see what had become of his enemy, he said to him, \"Senor, whoever you are,\ndo us the favour and kindness to give us a little rosemary, oil, salt, and wine, for it is wanted to cure one\nof the best knights-errant on earth, who lies on yonder bed wounded by the hands of the enchanted Moor\nthat is in this inn.\"\nWhen the officer heard him talk in this way, he took him for a man out of his senses, and as day was now\nbeginning to break, he opened the inn gate, and calling the host, he told him what this good man wanted.\nThe host furnished him with what he required, and Sancho brought it to Don Quixote, who, with his hand\nto his head, was bewailing the pain of the blow of the lamp, which had done him no more harm than\nraising a couple of rather large lumps, and what he fancied blood was only the sweat that flowed from\nhim in his sufferings during the late storm. To be brief, he took the materials, of which he made a\ncompound, mixing them all and boiling them a good while until it seemed to him they had come to\nperfection. He then asked for some vial to pour it into, and as there was not one in the inn, he decided on\nputting it into a tin oil-bottle or flask of which the host made him a free gift; and over the flask he\nrepeated more than eighty paternosters and as many more ave-marias, salves, and credos, accompanying\neach word with a cross by way of benediction, at all which there were present Sancho, the innkeeper, and\nthe officer; for the mule-driver was now peacefully engaged in attending to the comfort of his mules.\nThis being accomplished, he felt anxious to make trial himself, on the spot, of the virtue of this precious\nbalsam, as he considered it, and so he drank near a quart of what could not be put into the flask and\nremained in the pigskin in which it had been boiled; but scarcely had he done drinking when he began to\nvomit in such a way that nothing was left in his stomach, and with the pangs and spasms of vomiting he\nbroke into a profuse sweat, on account of which he bade them cover him up and leave him alone. They\ndid so, and he lay sleeping more than three hours, at the end of which he awoke and felt very great bodily\nrelief and so much ease from his bruises that he thought himself quite cured, and verily believed he had\nhit upon the balsam of Fierabras; and that with this remedy he might thenceforward, without any fear,\nface any kind of destruction, battle, or combat, however perilous it might be.\nSancho Panza, who also regarded the amendment of his master as miraculous, begged him to give him\nwhat was left in the pigskin, which was no small quantity. Don Quixote consented, and he, taking it with\nboth hands, in good faith and with a better will, gulped down and drained off very little less than his\nmaster. But the fact is, that the stomach of poor Sancho was of necessity not so delicate as that of his\nmaster, and so, before vomiting, he was seized with such gripings and retchings, and such sweats and\nfaintness, that verily and truly be believed his last hour had come, and finding himself so racked and\ntormented he cursed the balsam and the thief that had given it to him.\n-44\n\nDon Quixote seeing him in this state said, \"It is my belief, Sancho, that this mischief comes of thy not\nbeing dubbed a knight, for I am persuaded this liquor cannot be good for those who are not so.\"\n\"If your worship knew that,\" returned Sancho--\"woe betide me and all my kindred!--why did you let me\ntaste it?\"\nAt this moment the draught took effect, and the poor squire began to discharge both ways at such a rate\nthat the rush mat on which he had thrown himself and the canvas blanket he had covering him were fit for\nnothing afterwards. He sweated and perspired with such paroxysms and convulsions that not only he\nhimself but all present thought his end had come. This tempest and tribulation lasted about two hours, at\nthe end of which he was left, not like his master, but so weak and exhausted that he could not stand. Don\nQuixote, however, who, as has been said, felt himself relieved and well, was eager to take his departure at\nonce in quest of adventures, as it seemed to him that all the time he loitered there was a fraud upon the\nworld and those in it who stood in need of his help and protection, all the more when he had the security\nand confidence his balsam afforded him; and so, urged by this impulse, he saddled Rocinante himself and\nput the pack-saddle on his squire's beast, whom likewise he helped to dress and mount the ass; after\nwhich he mounted his horse and turning to a corner of the inn he laid hold of a pike that stood there, to\nserve him by way of a lance. All that were in the inn, who were more than twenty persons, stood watching\nhim; the innkeeper's daughter was likewise observing him, and he too never took his eyes off her, and\nfrom time to time fetched a sigh that he seemed to pluck up from the depths of his bowels; but they all\nthought it must be from the pain he felt in his ribs; at any rate they who had seen him plastered the night\nbefore thought so.\nAs soon as they were both mounted, at the gate of the inn, he called to the host and said in a very grave\nand measured voice, \"Many and great are the favours, Senor Governor, that I have received in this castle\nof yours, and I remain under the deepest obligation to be grateful to you for them all the days of my life;\nif I can repay them in avenging you of any arrogant foe who may have wronged you, know that my\ncalling is no other than to aid the weak, to avenge those who suffer wrong, and to chastise perfidy. Search\nyour memory, and if you find anything of this kind you need only tell me of it, and I promise you by the\norder of knighthood which I have received to procure you satisfaction and reparation to the utmost of\nyour desire.\"\nThe innkeeper replied to him with equal calmness, \"Sir Knight, I do not want your worship to avenge me\nof any wrong, because when any is done me I can take what vengeance seems good to me; the only thing\nI want is that you pay me the score that you have run up in the inn last night, as well for the straw and\nbarley for your two beasts, as for supper and beds.\"\n\"Then this is an inn?\" said Don Quixote.\n\"And a very respectable one,\" said the innkeeper.\n\"I have been under a mistake all this time,\" answered Don Quixote, \"for in truth I thought it was a castle,\nand not a bad one; but since it appears that it is not a castle but an inn, all that can be done now is that you\nshould excuse the payment, for I cannot contravene the rule of knights-errant, of whom I know as a fact\n(and up to the present I have read nothing to the contrary) that they never paid for lodging or anything\nelse in the inn where they might be; for any hospitality that might be offered them is their due by law and\nright in return for the insufferable toil they endure in seeking adventures by night and by day, in summer\nand in winter, on foot and on horseback, in hunger and thirst, cold and heat, exposed to all the\ninclemencies of heaven and all the hardships of earth.\"\n\"I have little to do with that,\" replied the innkeeper; \"pay me what you owe me, and let us have no more\n-45\n\ntalk of chivalry, for all I care about is to get my money.\"\n\"You are a stupid, scurvy innkeeper,\" said Don Quixote, and putting spurs to Rocinante and bringing his\npike to the slope he rode out of the inn before anyone could stop him, and pushed on some distance\nwithout looking to see if his squire was following him.\nThe innkeeper when he saw him go without paying him ran to get payment of Sancho, who said that as\nhis master would not pay neither would he, because, being as he was squire to a knight-errant, the same\nrule and reason held good for him as for his master with regard to not paying anything in inns and\nhostelries. At this the innkeeper waxed very wroth, and threatened if he did not pay to compel him in a\nway that he would not like. To which Sancho made answer that by the law of chivalry his master had\nreceived he would not pay a rap, though it cost him his life; for the excellent and ancient usage of\nknights-errant was not going to be violated by him, nor should the squires of such as were yet to come\ninto the world ever complain of him or reproach him with breaking so just a privilege.\nThe ill-luck of the unfortunate Sancho so ordered it that among the company in the inn there were four\nwoolcarders from Segovia, three needle-makers from the Colt of Cordova, and two lodgers from the Fair\nof Seville, lively fellows, tender-hearted, fond of a joke, and playful, who, almost as if instigated and\nmoved by a common impulse, made up to Sancho and dismounted him from his ass, while one of them\nwent in for the blanket of the host's bed; but on flinging him into it they looked up, and seeing that the\nceiling was somewhat lower what they required for their work, they decided upon going out into the yard,\nwhich was bounded by the sky, and there, putting Sancho in the middle of the blanket, they began to raise\nhim high, making sport with him as they would with a dog at Shrovetide.\nThe cries of the poor blanketed wretch were so loud that they reached the ears of his master, who, halting\nto listen attentively, was persuaded that some new adventure was coming, until he clearly perceived that it\nwas his squire who uttered them. Wheeling about he came up to the inn with a laborious gallop, and\nfinding it shut went round it to see if he could find some way of getting in; but as soon as he came to the\nwall of the yard, which was not very high, he discovered the game that was being played with his squire.\nHe saw him rising and falling in the air with such grace and nimbleness that, had his rage allowed him, it\nis my belief he would have laughed. He tried to climb from his horse on to the top of the wall, but he was\nso bruised and battered that he could not even dismount; and so from the back of his horse he began to\nutter such maledictions and objurgations against those who were blanketing Sancho as it would be\nimpossible to write down accurately: they, however, did not stay their laughter or their work for this, nor\ndid the flying Sancho cease his lamentations, mingled now with threats, now with entreaties but all to\nlittle purpose, or none at all, until from pure weariness they left off. They then brought him his ass, and\nmounting him on top of it they put his jacket round him; and the compassionate Maritornes, seeing him so\nexhausted, thought fit to refresh him with a jug of water, and that it might be all the cooler she fetched it\nfrom the well. Sancho took it, and as he was raising it to his mouth he was stopped by the cries of his\nmaster exclaiming, \"Sancho, my son, drink not water; drink it not, my son, for it will kill thee; see, here I\nhave the blessed balsam (and he held up the flask of liquor), and with drinking two drops of it thou wilt\ncertainly be restored.\"\nAt these words Sancho turned his eyes asquint, and in a still louder voice said, \"Can it be your worship\nhas forgotten that I am not a knight, or do you want me to end by vomiting up what bowels I have left\nafter last night? Keep your liquor in the name of all the devils, and leave me to myself!\" and at one and\nthe same instant he left off talking and began drinking; but as at the first sup he perceived it was water he\ndid not care to go on with it, and begged Maritornes to fetch him some wine, which she did with right\ngood will, and paid for it with her own money; for indeed they say of her that, though she was in the easy-\nvirtue line of life, there was some resemblance to a Christian about her. When Sancho had done drinking\nhe dug his heels into his ass, and the gate of the inn being thrown open he passed out very well pleased at\n-46\n\nhaving paid nothing and carried his point, though it had been at the expense of his usual sureties, his\nshoulders. It is true that the innkeeper detained his saddlebags in payment of what was owing to him, but\nSancho took his departure in such a flurry that he never missed them. The innkeeper, as soon as he saw\nhim off, wanted to bar the gate close, but the blanketers would not agree to it, for they were fellows who\nwould not have cared two farthings for Don Quixote, even had he been really one of the knights-errant of\nthe Round Table.\nCHAPTER XVIII.\nIN WHICH IS RELATED THE DISCOURSE SANCHO PANZA HELD WITH HIS MASTER, DON\nQUIXOTE, AND OTHER ADVENTURES WORTH RELATING\nSancho reached his master so limp and faint that he could not urge on his beast. When Don Quixote saw\nthe state he was in he said, \"I have now come to the conclusion, good Sancho, that this castle or inn is\nbeyond a doubt enchanted, because those who have so atrociously diverted themselves with thee, what\ncan they be but phantoms or beings of another world? and I hold this confirmed by having noticed that\nwhen I was by the wall of the yard witnessing the acts of thy sad tragedy, it was out of my power to\nmount upon it, nor could I even dismount from Rocinante, and so I do not doubt that they had me\nenchanted; for I swear to thee by the faith of what I am that if I had been able to climb up or dismount, I\nwould have avenged thee in such a way that those braggart thieves would have remembered their freak\nfor ever, even though in so doing I knew that I contravened the laws of chivalry, which, as I have often\ntold thee, do not permit a knight to lay hands on him who is not one, save in case of urgent and great\nnecessity in defence of his own life and person.\"\n\"I would have avenged myself too if I could,\" said Sancho, \"whether I had been dubbed knight or not, but\nI could not; though for my part I am persuaded those who amused themselves with me were not phantoms\nor enchanted men, as your worship says, but men of flesh and bone like ourselves; and they all had their\nnames, for I heard them name them when they were tossing me, and one was called Pedro Martinez, and\nanother Tenorio Hernandez, and the innkeeper, I heard, was called Juan Palomeque the Left-handed; so\nthat, senor, your not being able to leap over the wall of the yard or dismount from your horse came of\nsomething else besides enchantments; and what I make out clearly from all this is, that these adventures\nwe go seeking will in the end lead us into such misadventures that we shall not know which is our right\nfoot; and that the best and wisest thing, according to my small wits, would be for us to return home, now\nthat it is harvest-time, and attend to our business, and give over wandering from Zeca to Mecca and from\npail to bucket, as the saying is.\"\n\"How little thou knowest about chivalry, Sancho,\" replied Don Quixote; \"hold thy peace and have\npatience; the day will come when thou shalt see with thine own eyes what an honourable thing it is to\nwander in the pursuit of this calling; nay, tell me, what greater pleasure can there be in the world, or what\ndelight can equal that of winning a battle, and triumphing over one's enemy? None, beyond all doubt.\"\n\"Very likely,\" answered Sancho, \"though I do not know it; all I know is that since we have been\nknights-errant, or since your worship has been one (for I have no right to reckon myself one of so\nhonourable a number) we have never won any battle except the one with the Biscayan, and even out of\nthat your worship came with half an ear and half a helmet the less; and from that till now it has been all\ncudgellings and more cudgellings, cuffs and more cuffs, I getting the blanketing over and above, and\nfalling in with enchanted persons on whom I cannot avenge myself so as to know what the delight, as\nyour worship calls it, of conquering an enemy is like.\"\n\"That is what vexes me, and what ought to vex thee, Sancho,\" replied Don Quixote; \"but henceforward I\nwill endeavour to have at hand some sword made by such craft that no kind of enchantments can take\n-47\n\neffect upon him who carries it, and it is even possible that fortune may procure for me that which\nbelonged to Amadis when he was called 'The Knight of the Burning Sword,' which was one of the best\nswords that ever knight in the world possessed, for, besides having the said virtue, it cut like a razor, and\nthere was no armour, however strong and enchanted it might be, that could resist it.\"\n\"Such is my luck,\" said Sancho, \"that even if that happened and your worship found some such sword, it\nwould, like the balsam, turn out serviceable and good for dubbed knights only, and as for the squires, they\nmight sup sorrow.\"\n\"Fear not that, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote: \"Heaven will deal better by thee.\"\nThus talking, Don Quixote and his squire were going along, when, on the road they were following, Don\nQuixote perceived approaching them a large and thick cloud of dust, on seeing which he turned to Sancho\nand said:\n\"This is the day, Sancho, on which will be seen the boon my fortune is reserving for me; this, I say, is the\nday on which as much as on any other shall be displayed the might of my arm, and on which I shall do\ndeeds that shall remain written in the book of fame for all ages to come. Seest thou that cloud of dust\nwhich rises yonder? Well, then, all that is churned up by a vast army composed of various and countless\nnations that comes marching there.\"\n\"According to that there must be two,\" said Sancho, \"for on this opposite side also there rises just such\nanother cloud of dust.\"\nDon Quixote turned to look and found that it was true, and rejoicing exceedingly, he concluded that they\nwere two armies about to engage and encounter in the midst of that broad plain; for at all times and\nseasons his fancy was full of the battles, enchantments, adventures, crazy feats, loves, and defiances that\nare recorded in the books of chivalry, and everything he said, thought, or did had reference to such things.\nNow the cloud of dust he had seen was raised by two great droves of sheep coming along the same road\nin opposite directions, which, because of the dust, did not become visible until they drew near, but Don\nQuixote asserted so positively that they were armies that Sancho was led to believe it and say, \"Well, and\nwhat are we to do, senor?\"\n\"What?\" said Don Quixote: \"give aid and assistance to the weak and those who need it; and thou must\nknow, Sancho, that this which comes opposite to us is conducted and led by the mighty emperor\nAlifanfaron, lord of the great isle of Trapobana; this other that marches behind me is that of his enemy the\nking of the Garamantas, Pentapolin of the Bare Arm, for he always goes into battle with his right arm\nbare.\"\n\"But why are these two lords such enemies?\"\n\"They are at enmity,\" replied Don Quixote, \"because this Alifanfaron is a furious pagan and is in love\nwith the daughter of Pentapolin, who is a very beautiful and moreover gracious lady, and a Christian, and\nher father is unwilling to bestow her upon the pagan king unless he first abandons the religion of his false\nprophet Mahomet, and adopts his own.\"\n\"By my beard,\" said Sancho, \"but Pentapolin does quite right, and I will help him as much as I can.\"\n\"In that thou wilt do what is thy duty, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote; \"for to engage in battles of this sort it\nis not requisite to be a dubbed knight.\"\n-48\n\n\"That I can well understand,\" answered Sancho; \"but where shall we put this ass where we may be sure to\nfind him after the fray is over? for I believe it has not been the custom so far to go into battle on a beast of\nthis kind.\"\n\"That is true,\" said Don Quixote, \"and what you had best do with him is to leave him to take his chance\nwhether he be lost or not, for the horses we shall have when we come out victors will be so many that\neven Rocinante will run a risk of being changed for another. But attend to me and observe, for I wish to\ngive thee some account of the chief knights who accompany these two armies; and that thou mayest the\nbetter see and mark, let us withdraw to that hillock which rises yonder, whence both armies may be seen.\"\nThey did so, and placed themselves on a rising ground from which the two droves that Don Quixote made\narmies of might have been plainly seen if the clouds of dust they raised had not obscured them and\nblinded the sight; nevertheless, seeing in his imagination what he did not see and what did not exist, he\nbegan thus in a loud voice:\n\"That knight whom thou seest yonder in yellow armour, who bears upon his shield a lion crowned\ncrouching at the feet of a damsel, is the valiant Laurcalco, lord of the Silver Bridge; that one in armour\nwith flowers of gold, who bears on his shield three crowns argent on an azure field, is the dreaded\nMicocolembo, grand duke of Quirocia; that other of gigantic frame, on his right hand, is the ever\ndauntless Brandabarbaran de Boliche, lord of the three Arabias, who for armour wears that serpent skin,\nand has for shield a gate which, according to tradition, is one of those of the temple that Samson brought\nto the ground when by his death he revenged himself upon his enemies. But turn thine eyes to the other\nside, and thou shalt see in front and in the van of this other army the ever victorious and never vanquished\nTimonel of Carcajona, prince of New Biscay, who comes in armour with arms quartered azure, vert,\nwhite, and yellow, and bears on his shield a cat or on a field tawny with a motto which says Miau, which\nis the beginning of the name of his lady, who according to report is the peerless Miaulina, daughter of the\nduke Alfeniquen of the Algarve; the other, who burdens and presses the loins of that powerful charger\nand bears arms white as snow and a shield blank and without any device, is a novice knight, a Frenchman\nby birth, Pierres Papin by name, lord of the baronies of Utrique; that other, who with iron-shod heels\nstrikes the flanks of that nimble parti-coloured zebra, and for arms bears azure vair, is the mighty duke of\nNerbia, Espartafilardo del Bosque, who bears for device on his shield an asparagus plant with a motto in\nCastilian that says, Rastrea mi suerte.\" And so he went on naming a number of knights of one squadron or\nthe other out of his imagination, and to all he assigned off-hand their arms, colours, devices, and mottoes,\ncarried away by the illusions of his unheard-of madness; and without a pause, he continued, \"People of\ndivers nations compose this squadron in front; here are those that drink of the sweet waters of the famous\nXanthus, those that scour the woody Massilian plains, those that sift the pure fine gold of Arabia Felix,\nthose that enjoy the famed cool banks of the crystal Thermodon, those that in many and various ways\ndivert the streams of the golden Pactolus, the Numidians, faithless in their promises, the Persians\nrenowned in archery, the Parthians and the Medes that fight as they fly, the Arabs that ever shift their\ndwellings, the Scythians as cruel as they are fair, the Ethiopians with pierced lips, and an infinity of other\nnations whose features I recognise and descry, though I cannot recall their names. In this other squadron\nthere come those that drink of the crystal streams of the olive-bearing Betis, those that make smooth their\ncountenances with the water of the ever rich and golden Tagus, those that rejoice in the fertilising flow of\nthe divine Genil, those that roam the Tartesian plains abounding in pasture, those that take their pleasure\nin the Elysian meadows of Jerez, the rich Manchegans crowned with ruddy ears of corn, the wearers of\niron, old relics of the Gothic race, those that bathe in the Pisuerga renowned for its gentle current, those\nthat feed their herds along the spreading pastures of the winding Guadiana famed for its hidden course,\nthose that tremble with the cold of the pineclad Pyrenees or the dazzling snows of the lofty Apennine; in a\nword, as many as all Europe includes and contains.\"\nGood God! what a number of countries and nations he named! giving to each its proper attributes with\n-49\n\nmarvellous readiness; brimful and saturated with what he had read in his lying books! Sancho Panza hung\nupon his words without speaking, and from time to time turned to try if he could see the knights and\ngiants his master was describing, and as he could not make out one of them he said to him:\n\"Senor, devil take it if there's a sign of any man you talk of, knight or giant, in the whole thing; maybe\nit's all enchantment, like the phantoms last night.\"\n\"How canst thou say that!\" answered Don Quixote; \"dost thou not hear the neighing of the steeds, the\nbraying of the trumpets, the roll of the drums?\"\n\"I hear nothing but a great bleating of ewes and sheep,\" said Sancho; which was true, for by this time the\ntwo flocks had come close.\n\"The fear thou art in, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"prevents thee from seeing or hearing correctly, for one\nof the effects of fear is to derange the senses and make things appear different from what they are; if thou\nart in such fear, withdraw to one side and leave me to myself, for alone I suffice to bring victory to that\nside to which I shall give my aid;\" and so saying he gave Rocinante the spur, and putting the lance in rest,\nshot down the slope like a thunderbolt. Sancho shouted after him, crying, \"Come back, Senor Don\nQuixote; I vow to God they are sheep and ewes you are charging! Come back! Unlucky the father that\nbegot me! what madness is this! Look, there is no giant, nor knight, nor cats, nor arms, nor shields\nquartered or whole, nor vair azure or bedevilled. What are you about? Sinner that I am before God!\" But\nnot for all these entreaties did Don Quixote turn back; on the contrary he went on shouting out, \"Ho,\nknights, ye who follow and fight under the banners of the valiant emperor Pentapolin of the Bare Arm,\nfollow me all; ye shall see how easily I shall give him his revenge over his enemy Alifanfaron of the\nTrapobana.\"\nSo saying, he dashed into the midst of the squadron of ewes, and began spearing them with as much spirit\nand intrepidity as if he were transfixing mortal enemies in earnest. The shepherds and drovers\naccompanying the flock shouted to him to desist; seeing it was no use, they ungirt their slings and began\nto salute his ears with stones as big as one's fist. Don Quixote gave no heed to the stones, but, letting\ndrive right and left kept saying:\n\"Where art thou, proud Alifanfaron? Come before me; I am a single knight who would fain prove thy\nprowess hand to hand, and make thee yield thy life a penalty for the wrong thou dost to the valiant\nPentapolin Garamanta.\" Here came a sugar-plum from the brook that struck him on the side and buried a\ncouple of ribs in his body. Feeling himself so smitten, he imagined himself slain or badly wounded for\ncertain, and recollecting his liquor he drew out his flask, and putting it to his mouth began to pour the\ncontents into his stomach; but ere he had succeeded in swallowing what seemed to him enough, there\ncame another almond which struck him on the hand and on the flask so fairly that it smashed it to pieces,\nknocking three or four teeth and grinders out of his mouth in its course, and sorely crushing two fingers of\nhis hand. Such was the force of the first blow and of the second, that the poor knight in spite of himself\ncame down backwards off his horse. The shepherds came up, and felt sure they had killed him; so in all\nhaste they collected their flock together, took up the dead beasts, of which there were more than seven,\nand made off without waiting to ascertain anything further.\nAll this time Sancho stood on the hill watching the crazy feats his master was performing, and tearing his\nbeard and cursing the hour and the occasion when fortune had made him acquainted with him. Seeing\nhim, then, brought to the ground, and that the shepherds had taken themselves off, he ran to him and\nfound him in very bad case, though not unconscious; and said he:\n\"Did I not tell you to come back, Senor Don Quixote; and that what you were going to attack were not\n-50\n\narmies but droves of sheep?\"\n\"That's how that thief of a sage, my enemy, can alter and falsify things,\" answered Don Quixote; \"thou\nmust know, Sancho, that it is a very easy matter for those of his sort to make us believe what they choose;\nand this malignant being who persecutes me, envious of the glory he knew I was to win in this battle, has\nturned the squadrons of the enemy into droves of sheep. At any rate, do this much, I beg of thee, Sancho,\nto undeceive thyself, and see that what I say is true; mount thy ass and follow them quietly, and thou shalt\nsee that when they have gone some little distance from this they will return to their original shape and,\nceasing to be sheep, become men in all respects as I described them to thee at first. But go not just yet, for\nI want thy help and assistance; come hither, and see how many of my teeth and grinders are missing, for I\nfeel as if there was not one left in my mouth.\"\nSancho came so close that he almost put his eyes into his mouth; now just at that moment the balsam had\nacted on the stomach of Don Quixote, so, at the very instant when Sancho came to examine his mouth, he\ndischarged all its contents with more force than a musket, and full into the beard of the compassionate\nsquire.\n\"Holy Mary!\" cried Sancho, \"what is this that has happened me? Clearly this sinner is mortally wounded,\nas he vomits blood from the mouth;\" but considering the matter a little more closely he perceived by the\ncolour, taste, and smell, that it was not blood but the balsam from the flask which he had seen him drink;\nand he was taken with such a loathing that his stomach turned, and he vomited up his inside over his very\nmaster, and both were left in a precious state. Sancho ran to his ass to get something wherewith to clean\nhimself, and relieve his master, out of his saddlebags; but not finding them, he well-nigh took leave of his\nsenses, and cursed himself anew, and in his heart resolved to quit his master and return home, even\nthough he forfeited the wages of his service and all hopes of the promised island.\nDon Quixote now rose, and putting his left hand to his mouth to keep his teeth from falling out altogether,\nwith the other he laid hold of the bridle of Rocinante, who had never stirred from his master's side--so\nloyal and well-behaved was he--and betook himself to where the squire stood leaning over his ass with his\nhand to his cheek, like one in deep dejection. Seeing him in this mood, looking so sad, Don Quixote said\nto him:\n\"Bear in mind, Sancho, that one man is no more than another, unless he does more than another; all these\ntempests that fall upon us are signs that fair weather is coming shortly, and that things will go well with\nus, for it is impossible for good or evil to last for ever; and hence it follows that the evil having lasted\nlong, the good must be now nigh at hand; so thou must not distress thyself at the misfortunes which\nhappen to me, since thou hast no share in them.\"\n\"How have I not?\" replied Sancho; \"was he whom they blanketed yesterday perchance any other than my\nfather's son? and the saddlebags that are missing to-day with all my treasures, did they belong to any\nother but myself?\"\n\"What! are the saddlebags missing, Sancho?\" said Don Quixote.\n\"Yes, they are missing,\" answered Sancho.\n\"In that case we have nothing to eat to-day,\" replied Don Quixote.\n\"It would be so,\" answered Sancho, \"if there were none of the herbs your worship says you know in these\nmeadows, those with which knights-errant as unlucky as your worship are wont to supply such-like\nshortcomings.\"\n-51\n\n\"For all that,\" answered Don Quixote, \"I would rather have just now a quarter of bread, or a loaf and a\ncouple of pilchards' heads, than all the herbs described by Dioscorides, even with Doctor Laguna's notes.\nNevertheless, Sancho the Good, mount thy beast and come along with me, for God, who provides for all\nthings, will not fail us (more especially when we are so active in his service as we are), since he fails not\nthe midges of the air, nor the grubs of the earth, nor the tadpoles of the water, and is so merciful that he\nmaketh his sun to rise on the good and on the evil, and sendeth rain on the unjust and on the just.\"\n\"Your worship would make a better preacher than knight-errant,\" said Sancho.\n\"Knights-errant knew and ought to know everything, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote; \"for there were\nknights-errant in former times as well qualified to deliver a sermon or discourse in the middle of an\nencampment, as if they had graduated in the University of Paris; whereby we may see that the lance has\nnever blunted the pen, nor the pen the lance.\"\n\"Well, be it as your worship says,\" replied Sancho; \"let us be off now and find some place of shelter for\nthe night, and God grant it may be somewhere where there are no blankets, nor blanketeers, nor\nphantoms, nor enchanted Moors; for if there are, may the devil take the whole concern.\"\n\"Ask that of God, my son,\" said Don Quixote; \"and do thou lead on where thou wilt, for this time I leave\nour lodging to thy choice; but reach me here thy hand, and feel with thy finger, and find out how many of\nmy teeth and grinders are missing from this right side of the upper jaw, for it is there I feel the pain.\"\nSancho put in his fingers, and feeling about asked him, \"How many grinders used your worship have on\nthis side?\"\n\"Four,\" replied Don Quixote, \"besides the back-tooth, all whole and quite sound.\"\n\"Mind what you are saying, senor.\"\n\"I say four, if not five,\" answered Don Quixote, \"for never in my life have I had tooth or grinder drawn,\nnor has any fallen out or been destroyed by any decay or rheum.\"\n\"Well, then,\" said Sancho, \"in this lower side your worship has no more than two grinders and a half, and\nin the upper neither a half nor any at all, for it is all as smooth as the palm of my hand.\"\n\"Luckless that I am!\" said Don Quixote, hearing the sad news his squire gave him; \"I had rather they\ndespoiled me of an arm, so it were not the sword-arm; for I tell thee, Sancho, a mouth without teeth is like\na mill without a millstone, and a tooth is much more to be prized than a diamond; but we who profess the\naustere order of chivalry are liable to all this. Mount, friend, and lead the way, and I will follow thee at\nwhatever pace thou wilt.\"\nSancho did as he bade him, and proceeded in the direction in which he thought he might find refuge\nwithout quitting the high road, which was there very much frequented. As they went along, then, at a slow\npace--for the pain in Don Quixote's jaws kept him uneasy and ill-disposed for speed.\nCHAPTER XIX.\nOF THE ADVENTURE OF THE DEAD BODY, TOGETHER WITH OTHER NOTABLE\nOCCURRENCES\nIt happened that night overtook them on the road before they had reached or discovered any place of\n-52\n\nshelter; and what made it still worse was that they were dying of hunger, for with the loss of the\nsaddlebags they had lost their entire larder and commissariat; and to complete the misfortune they met\nwith an adventure which without any invention had really the appearance of one. It so happened that the\nnight closed in somewhat darkly, but for all that they pushed on, Sancho feeling sure that as the road was\nthe king's highway they might reasonably expect to find some inn within a league or two. Going along,\nthen, in this way, the night dark, the squire hungry, the master sharp-set, they saw coming towards them\non the road they were travelling a great number of lights which looked exactly like stars in motion.\nSancho was taken aback at the sight of them, nor did Don Quixote altogether relish them: the one pulled\nup his ass by the halter, the other his hack by the bridle, and they stood still, watching anxiously to see\nwhat all this would turn out to be, and found that the lights were approaching them, and the nearer they\ncame the greater they seemed, at which spectacle Sancho began to shake like a man dosed with mercury,\nand Don Quixote's hair stood on end; he, however, plucking up spirit a little, said:\n\"This, no doubt, Sancho, will be a most mighty and perilous adventure, in which it will be needful for me\nto put forth all my valour and resolution.\"\n\"Unlucky me!\" answered Sancho; \"if this adventure happens to be one of phantoms, as I am beginning to\nthink it is, where shall I find the ribs to bear it?\"\n\"Be they phantoms ever so much,\" said Don Quixote, \"I will not permit them to touch a thread of thy\ngarments; for if they played tricks with thee the time before, it was because I was unable to leap the walls\nof the yard; but now we are on a wide plain, where I shall be able to wield my sword as I please.\"\n\"And if they enchant and cripple you as they did the last time,\" said Sancho, \"what difference will it make\nbeing on the open plain or not?\"\n\"For all that,\" replied Don Quixote, \"I entreat thee, Sancho, to keep a good heart, for experience will tell\nthee what mine is.\"\n\"I will, please God,\" answered Sancho, and the two retiring to one side of the road set themselves to\nobserve closely what all these moving lights might be; and very soon afterwards they made out some\ntwenty persons hooded and robed in white, all on horseback, with lighted torches in their hands, the\nawe-inspiring aspect of whom completely extinguished the courage of Sancho, who began to chatter with\nhis teeth like one in the cold fit of an ague; and his heart sank and his teeth chattered still more when they\nperceived distinctly that behind them there came a litter covered over with black and followed by six\nmore mounted figures in mourning down to the very feet of their mules--for they could perceive plainly\nthey were not horses by the easy pace at which they went. And as the white-robed persons came along\nthey muttered to themselves in a low plaintive tone. This strange spectacle at such an hour and in such a\nsolitary place was quite enough to strike terror into Sancho's heart, and even into his master's; and (save\nin Don Quixote's case) did so, for all Sancho's resolution had now broken down. It was just the opposite\nwith his master, whose imagination immediately conjured up all this to him vividly as one of the\nadventures of his books.\nHe took it into his head that the litter was a bier on which was borne some sorely wounded or slain\nknight, to avenge whom was a task reserved for him alone; and without any further reasoning he laid his\nlance in rest, fixed himself firmly in his saddle, and with gallant spirit and bearing took up his position in\nthe middle of the road where the white-robed persons must of necessity pass; and as soon as he saw them\nnear at hand he raised his voice and said:\n\"Halt, knights, or whosoever ye may be, and render me account of who ye are, whence ye come, where ye\ngo, what it is ye carry upon that bier, for, to judge by appearances, either ye have done some wrong or\n-53\n\nsome wrong has been done to you, and it is fitting and necessary that I should know, either that I may\nchastise you for the evil ye have done, or else that I may avenge you for the injury that has been inflicted\nupon you.\"\n\"We are in haste,\" answered one of the white-robed persons, \"and the inn is far off, and we cannot stop to\nrender you such an account as you demand;\" and spurring his mule he moved on.\nDon Quixote was mightily provoked by this answer, and seizing the mule by the bridle he said, \"Halt, and\nbe more mannerly, and render an account of what I have asked of you; else, take my defiance to combat,\nall of you.\"\nThe mule was shy, and was so frightened at her bridle being seized that rearing up she flung her rider to\nthe ground over her haunches. An attendant who was on foot, seeing the encamisado fall, began to abuse\nDon Quixote, who now moved to anger, without any more ado, laying his lance in rest charged one of the\nmen in mourning and brought him badly wounded to the ground, and as he wheeled round upon the\nothers the agility with which he attacked and routed them was a sight to see, for it seemed just as if wings\nhad that instant grown upon Rocinante, so lightly and proudly did he bear himself. The white-robed\npersons were all timid folk and unarmed, so they speedily made their escape from the fray and set off at a\nrun across the plain with their lighted torches, looking exactly like maskers running on some gala or\nfestival night. The mourners, too, enveloped and swathed in their skirts and gowns, were unable to bestir\nthemselves, and so with entire safety to himself Don Quixote belaboured them all and drove them off\nagainst their will, for they all thought it was no man but a devil from hell come to carry away the dead\nbody they had in the litter.\nSancho beheld all this in astonishment at the intrepidity of his lord, and said to himself, \"Clearly this\nmaster of mine is as bold and valiant as he says he is.\"\nA burning torch lay on the ground near the first man whom the mule had thrown, by the light of which\nDon Quixote perceived him, and coming up to him he presented the point of the lance to his face, calling\non him to yield himself prisoner, or else he would kill him; to which the prostrate man replied, \"I am\nprisoner enough as it is; I cannot stir, for one of my legs is broken: I entreat you, if you be a Christian\ngentleman, not to kill me, which will be committing grave sacrilege, for I am a curate and I hold first\norders.\"\n\"Then what the devil brought you here, being a churchman?\" said Don Quixote.\n\"What else but bad luck?\" said the curate.\n\"Then still worse awaits you,\" said Don Quixote, \"if you do not satisfy me as to all I asked you at first.\"\n\"You shall be soon satisfied,\" said the curate; \"you must know, then, that though just now I said I was a\ncurate, I am only a bachelor, and my name is Alonzo Lopez; I am a native of Alcobendas, I come from\nthe city of Baeza with eleven others, priests, the same who fled with the torches, and we are going to the\ncity of Segovia accompanying a dead body which is in that litter, and is that of a gentleman who died in\nBaeza, where he was interred; and now, as I said, we are taking his bones to their burial-place, which is in\nSegovia, where he was born.\"\n\"And who killed him?\" asked Don Quixote.\n\"God, by means of a malignant fever that took him,\" answered the bachelor.\n-54\n\n\"In that case,\" said Don Quixote, \"the Lord has relieved me of the task of avenging his death had any\nother slain him; but, he who slew him having slain him, there is nothing for it but to be silent, and shrug\none's shoulders; I should do the same were he to slay myself; and I would have your reverence know that\nI am a knight of La Mancha, Don Quixote by name, and it is my business and calling to roam the world\nredressing injuries and making crooked things straight.\"\n\"I do not know about straightening,\" said the bachelor, \"for from straight you have made me crooked,\nleaving me with a broken leg that will never see itself straight again all the days of its life; and the injury\nyou have redressed in my case has been to leave me injured in such a way that I shall remain injured for\never; and the height of misadventure it was to fall in with you who go in search of adventures.\"\n\"Things do not all happen in the same way,\" answered Don Quixote; \"it all came, Sir Bachelor Alonzo\nLopez, of your going, as you did, by night, dressed in those surplices, with lighted torches, praying,\ncovered with mourning, so that naturally you looked like something evil and of the other world; and so I\ncould not avoid doing my duty in attacking you, and I should have attacked you even had I known\npositively that you were the very devils of hell, for such I certainly believed and took you to be.\"\n\"As my fate has so willed it,\" said the bachelor, \"I entreat you, sir knight-errant, whose errand has been\nsuch an evil one for me, to help me to get from under this mule that holds one of my legs caught between\nthe stirrup and the saddle.\"\n\"I would have talked on till to-morrow,\" said Don Quixote; \"How long were you going to wait before\ntelling me of your distress?\"\nHe at once called to Sancho, who, however, had no mind to come, as he was just then engaged in\nunloading a sumpter mule, well laden with provender, which these worthy gentlemen had brought with\nthem. Sancho made a bag of his coat, and, getting together as much as he could, and as the bag would\nhold, he loaded his beast, and then hastened to obey his master's call, and helped him to remove the\nbachelor from under the mule; then putting him on her back he gave him the torch, and Don Quixote bade\nhim follow the track of his companions, and beg pardon of them on his part for the wrong which he could\nnot help doing them.\nAnd said Sancho, \"If by chance these gentlemen should want to know who was the hero that served them\nso, your worship may tell them that he is the famous Don Quixote of La Mancha, otherwise called the\nKnight of Regretful Appearance.\"\nOn hearing this the bachelor took his departure without making any reply; and Don Quixote asked Sancho\nwhat had induced him to call him the \"Knight of Regretful Appearance\" more then than at any other time.\n\"I will tell you,\" answered Sancho; \"it was because I have been looking at you for some time by the light\nof the torch held by that unfortunate, and verily your worship has got of late the most regretful\nappearance I ever saw: it must be either owing to the fatigue of this combat, or else to the want of teeth\nand grinders.\"\n\"It is not that,\" replied Don Quixote, \"but because the sage whose duty it will be to write the history of\nmy achievements must have thought it proper that I should take some distinctive name as all knights of\nyore did; one being 'He of the Burning Sword,' another 'He of the Unicorn,' this one 'He of the\nDamsels,' that 'He of the Phoenix,' another 'The Knight of the Griffin,' and another 'He of the Death,'\nand by these names and designations they were known all the world round; and so I say that the sage\naforesaid must have put it into your mouth and mind just now to call me 'The Knight of Regretful\nAppearance,' as I intend to call myself from this day forward; and that the said name may fit me better, I\n-55\n\nmean, when the opportunity offers, to have a very regretful appearance painted on my shield.\"\n\"There is no occasion, senor, for wasting time or money on making that countenance,\" said Sancho; \"for\nall that need be done is for your worship to show your own, face to face, to those who look at you, and\nwithout anything more, either image or shield, they will call you 'Him of Regretful Appearance' and\nbelieve me I am telling you the truth, for I assure you, senor (and in good part be it said), hunger and the\nloss of your grinders have given you such a regretable appearance that, as I say, the regretful picture may\nbe very well spared.\"\nDon Quixote laughed at Sancho's pleasantry; nevertheless he resolved to call himself by that name, and\nhave his shield or buckler painted as he had devised. Don Quixote would have looked to see whether the\nbody in the litter were bones or not, but Sancho would not have it, saying:\n\"Senor, you have ended this perilous adventure more safely for yourself than any of those I have seen:\nperhaps these people, though beaten and routed, may bethink themselves that it is a single man that has\nbeaten them, and feeling sore and ashamed of it may take heart and come in search of us and give us\ntrouble enough. The ass is in proper trim, the mountains are near at hand, hunger presses, we have\nnothing more to do but make good our retreat, and, as the saying is, the dead to the grave and the living to\nthe loaf.\"\nAnd driving his ass before him he begged his master to follow, who, feeling that Sancho was right, did so\nwithout replying; and after proceeding some little distance between two hills they found themselves in a\nwide and retired valley, where they alighted, and Sancho unloaded his beast, and stretched upon the green\ngrass, with hunger for sauce, they breakfasted, dined, lunched, and supped all at once, satisfying their\nappetites with more than one store of cold meat which the dead man's clerical gentlemen (who seldom put\nthemselves on short allowance) had brought with them on their sumpter mule. But another piece of\nill-luck befell them, which Sancho held the worst of all, and that was that they had no wine to drink, nor\neven water to moisten their lips; and as thirst tormented them, Sancho, observing that the meadow where\nthey were was full of green and tender grass, said what will be told in the following chapter.\nCHAPTER XX.\nOF THE UNEXAMPLED AND UNHEARD-OF ADVENTURE WHICH WAS ACHIEVED BY THE\nVALIANT DON QUIXOTE OF LA MANCHA WITH LESS PERIL THAN ANY EVER ACHIEVED\nBY ANY FAMOUS KNIGHT IN THE WORLD\n\"It cannot be, senor, but that this grass is a proof that there must be hard by some spring or brook to give\nit moisture, so it would be well to move a little farther on, that we may find some place where we may\nquench this terrible thirst that plagues us, which beyond a doubt is more distressing than hunger.\"\nThe advice seemed good to Don Quixote, and, he leading Rocinante by the bridle and Sancho the ass by\nthe halter, after he had packed away upon him the remains of the supper, they advanced the meadow\nfeeling their way, for the darkness of the night made it impossible to see anything; but they had not gone\ntwo hundred paces when a loud noise of water, as if falling from great rocks, struck their ears. The sound\ncheered them greatly; but halting to make out by listening from what quarter it came they heard\nunseasonably another noise which spoiled the satisfaction the sound of the water gave them, especially\nfor Sancho, who was by nature timid and faint-hearted. They heard, I say, strokes falling with a measured\nbeat, and a certain rattling of iron and chains that, together with the furious din of the water, would have\nstruck terror into any heart but Don Quixote's. The night was, as has been said, dark, and they had\nhappened to reach a spot in among some tall trees, whose leaves stirred by a gentle breeze made a low\nominous sound; so that, what with the solitude, the place, the darkness, the noise of the water, and the\n-56\n\nrustling of the leaves, everything inspired awe and dread; more especially as they perceived that the\nstrokes did not cease, nor the wind lull, nor morning approach; to all which might be added their\nignorance as to where they were.\nBut Don Quixote, supported by his intrepid heart, leaped on Rocinante, and bracing his buckler on his\narm, brought his pike to the slope, and said, \"Friend Sancho, know that I by Heaven's will have been born\nin this our iron age to revive revive in it the age of gold, or the golden as it is called; I am he for whom\nperils, mighty achievements, and valiant deeds are reserved; I am, I say again, he who is to revive the\nKnights of the Round Table, the Twelve of France and the Nine Worthies; and he who is to consign to\noblivion the Platirs, the Tablantes, the Olivantes and Tirantes, the Phoebuses and Belianises, with the\nwhole herd of famous knights-errant of days gone by, performing in these in which I live such exploits,\nmarvels, and feats of arms as shall obscure their brightest deeds. Thou dost mark well, faithful and trusty\nsquire, the gloom of this night, its strange silence, the dull confused murmur of those trees, the awful\nsound of that water in quest of which we came, that seems as though it were precipitating and dashing\nitself down from the lofty mountains of the Moon, and that incessant hammering that wounds and pains\nour ears; which things all together and each of itself are enough to instil fear, dread, and dismay into the\nbreast of Mars himself, much more into one not used to hazards and adventures of the kind. Well, then, all\nthis that I put before thee is but an incentive and stimulant to my spirit, making my heart burst in my\nbosom through eagerness to engage in this adventure, arduous as it promises to be; therefore tighten\nRocinante's girths a little, and God be with thee; wait for me here three days and no more, and if in that\ntime I come not back, thou canst return to our village, and thence, to do me a favour and a service, thou\nwilt go to El Toboso, where thou shalt say to my incomparable lady Dulcinea that her captive knight hath\ndied in attempting things that might make him worthy of being called hers.\"\nWhen Sancho heard his master's words he began to weep in the most pathetic way, saying:\n\"Senor, I know not why your worship wants to attempt this so dreadful adventure; it is night now, no one\nsees us here, we can easily turn about and take ourselves out of danger, even if we don't drink for three\ndays to come; and as there is no one to see us, all the less will there be anyone to set us down as cowards;\nbesides, I have many a time heard the curate of our village, whom your worship knows well, preach that\nhe who seeks danger perishes in it; so it is not right to tempt God by trying so tremendous a feat from\nwhich there can be no escape save by a miracle, and Heaven has performed enough of them for your\nworship in delivering you from being blanketed as I was, and bringing you out victorious and safe and\nsound from among all those enemies that were with the dead man; and if all this does not move or soften\nthat hard heart, let this thought and reflection move it, that you will have hardly quitted this spot when\nfrom pure fear I shall yield my soul up to anyone that will take it. I left home and wife and children to\ncome and serve your worship, trusting to do better and not worse; but as covetousness bursts the bag, it\nhas rent my hopes asunder, for just as I had them highest about getting that wretched unlucky island your\nworship has so often promised me, I see that instead and in lieu of it you mean to desert me now in a\nplace so far from human reach: for God's sake, master mine, deal not so unjustly by me, and if your\nworship will not entirely give up attempting this feat, at least put it off till morning, for by what the lore I\nlearned when I was a shepherd tells me it cannot want three hours of dawn now, because the mouth of the\nHorn is overhead and makes midnight in the line of the left arm.\"\n\"How canst thou see, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"where it makes that line, or where this mouth or this\nocciput is that thou talkest of, when the night is so dark that there is not a star to be seen in the whole\nheaven?\"\n\"That's true,\" said Sancho, \"but fear has sharp eyes, and sees things underground, much more above in\nheavens; besides, there is good reason to show that it now wants but little of day.\"\n-57\n\n\"Let it want what it may,\" replied Don Quixote, \"it shall not be said of me now or at any time that tears or\nentreaties turned me aside from doing what was in accordance with knightly usage; and so I beg of thee,\nSancho, to hold thy peace, for God, who has put it into my heart to undertake now this so unexampled\nand terrible adventure, will take care to watch over my safety and console thy sorrow; what thou hast to\ndo is to tighten Rocinante's girths well, and wait here, for I shall come back shortly, alive or dead.\"\nSancho perceiving it his master's final resolve, and how little his tears, counsels, and entreaties prevailed\nwith him, determined to have recourse to his own ingenuity and compel him, if he could, to wait till\ndaylight; and so, while tightening the girths of the horse, he quietly and without being felt, with his ass'\nhalter tied both Rocinante's legs, so that when Don Quixote strove to go he was unable as the horse could\nonly move by jumps. Seeing the success of his trick, Sancho Panza said:\n\"See there, senor! Heaven, moved by my tears and prayers, has so ordered it that Rocinante cannot stir;\nand if you will be obstinate, and spur and strike him, you will only provoke fortune, and kick, as they say,\nagainst the pricks.\"\nDon Quixote at this grew desperate, but the more he drove his heels into the horse, the less he stirred him;\nand not having any suspicion of the tying, he was fain to resign himself and wait till daybreak or until\nRocinante could move, firmly persuaded that all this came of something other than Sancho's ingenuity.\nSo he said to him, \"As it is so, Sancho, and as Rocinante cannot move, I am content to wait till dawn\nsmiles upon us, even though I weep while it delays its coming.\"\n\"There is no need to weep,\" answered Sancho, \"for I will amuse your worship by telling stories from this\ntill daylight, unless indeed you like to dismount and lie down to sleep a little on the green grass after the\nfashion of knights-errant, so as to be fresher when day comes and the moment arrives for attempting this\nextraordinary adventure you are looking forward to.\"\n\"What art thou talking about dismounting or sleeping for?\" said Don Quixote. \"Am I, thinkest thou, one\nof those knights that take their rest in the presence of danger? Sleep thou who art born to sleep, or do as\nthou wilt, for I will do what I think befits my profession.\"\n\"Be not angry, master mine,\" replied Sancho, \"I did not mean to say that;\" and coming close to him he\nlaid one hand on the pommel of the saddle and the other on back of it so that he held his master's left\nthigh in his embrace, not daring to separate a finger's width from him; so much afraid was he of the\nstrokes which still resounded with a regular beat. Don Quixote bade him tell some story to amuse him as\nhe had proposed, to which Sancho replied that he would if his dread of what he heard would let him;\n\"Still,\" said he, \"I will strive to tell a story which, if I can manage to relate it, and nobody interferes with\nthe telling, is the best of stories, and let your worship give me your attention, for here I begin. What was,\nwas; and may the good that is to come be for all, and the evil for him who goes to look for it--your\nworship must know that the beginning the old folk used to put to their tales was not just as each one\npleased; it was a maxim of Cato Zonzorino the Roman, that says 'the evil for him that goes to look for it,'\nand it comes as pat to the purpose now as ring to finger, to show that your worship should keep quiet and\nnot go looking for evil in any quarter, and that we should go back by some other road, since nobody\nforces us to follow this in which so many terrors affright us.\"\n\"Go on with thy story, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"and leave the choice of our road to me.\"\n\"I say then,\" continued Sancho, \"that in a village of Estremadura there was a goat-shepherd--that is to\nsay, one who tended goats--which shepherd or goatherd, as my story goes, was called Lope Ruiz, and this\nLope Ruiz was in love with a shepherdess called Torralva, which shepherdess called Torralva was the\ndaughter of a rich grazier, and this rich grazier-\"\n-58\n\n\"If that is the way thou tellest thy tale, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"repeating twice all thou hast to say,\nthou wilt not have done these two days; go straight on with it, and tell it like a reasonable man, or else say\nnothing.\"\n\"Tales are always told in my country in the very way I am telling this,\" answered Sancho, \"and I cannot\ntell it in any other, nor is it right of your worship to make me take up new customs.\"\n\"Tell it as thou wilt,\" replied Don Quixote; \"and as fate will have it that I cannot help listening to thee, go\non.\"\n\"And so, lord of my soul,\" continued Sancho, as I have said, this shepherd was in love with Torralva the\nshepherdess, who was a wild buxom lass with something of the look of a man about her, for she had little\nmoustaches; I fancy I see her now.\"\n\"Then you knew her?\" said Don Quixote.\n\"I did not know her,\" said Sancho, \"but he who told me the story said it was so true and certain that when\nI told it to another I might safely declare and swear I had seen it all myself. And so in course of time, the\ndevil, who never sleeps and puts everything in confusion, contrived that the love the shepherd bore the\nshepherdess turned into hatred and ill-will, and the reason, according to evil tongues, was some little\njealousy she caused him that crossed the line and trespassed on forbidden ground; and so much did the\nshepherd hate her from that time forward that, in order to escape from her, he determined to quit the\ncountry and go where he should never set eyes on her again. Torralva, when she found herself spurned by\nLope, was immediately smitten with love for him, though she had never loved him before.\"\n\"That is the natural way of women,\" said Don Quixote, \"to scorn the one that loves them, and love the\none that hates them: go on, Sancho.\"\n\"It came to pass,\" said Sancho, \"that the shepherd carried out his intention, and driving his goats before\nhim took his way across the plains of Estremadura to pass over into the Kingdom of Portugal. Torralva,\nwho knew of it, went after him, and on foot and barefoot followed him at a distance, with a pilgrim's staff\nin her hand and a scrip round her neck, in which she carried, it is said, a bit of looking-glass and a piece\nof a comb and some little pot or other of paint for her face; but let her carry what she did, I am not going\nto trouble myself to prove it; all I say is, that the shepherd, they say, came with his flock to cross over the\nriver Guadiana, which was at that time swollen and almost overflowing its banks, and at the spot he came\nto there was neither ferry nor boat nor anyone to carry him or his flock to the other side, at which he was\nmuch vexed, for he perceived that Torralva was approaching and would give him great annoyance with\nher tears and entreaties; however, he went looking about so closely that he discovered a fisherman who\nhad alongside of him a boat so small that it could only hold one person and one goat; but for all that he\nspoke to him and agreed with him to carry himself and his three hundred goats across. The fisherman got\ninto the boat and carried one goat over; he came back and carried another over; he came back again, and\nagain brought over another--let your worship keep count of the goats the fisherman is taking across, for if\none escapes the memory there will be an end of the story, and it will be impossible to tell another word of\nit. To proceed, I must tell you the landing place on the other side was miry and slippery, and the\nfisherman lost a great deal of time in going and coming; still he returned for another goat, and another,\nand another.\"\n\"Take it for granted he brought them all across,\" said Don Quixote, \"and don't keep going and coming in\nthis way, or thou wilt not make an end of bringing them over this twelvemonth.\"\n\"How many have gone across so far?\" said Sancho.\n-59\n\n\"How the devil do I know?\" replied Don Quixote.\n\"There it is,\" said Sancho, \"what I told you, that you must keep a good count; well then, by God, there is\nan end of the story, for there is no going any farther.\"\n\"How can that be?\" said Don Quixote; \"is it so essential to the story to know exactly how many goats\nhave crossed over, that if there is a mistake of one, thou canst not go on with it?\"\n\"No, senor, not a bit,\" replied Sancho; \"for when I asked your worship to tell me how many goats had\ncrossed, and you answered you did not know, at that very instant all I had to say passed away out of my\nmemory, but you can bet there was much virtue in it, and entertainment.\"\n\"So, then,\" said Don Quixote, \"the story has come to an end?\"\n\"It is as finished as my mother,\" said Sancho.\n\"In truth,\" said Don Quixote, \"thou hast told one of the rarest stories, tales, or histories, that anyone in the\nworld could have imagined, and such a way of telling it and ending it was never seen nor will be in a\nlifetime; though I expected nothing else from thy nimble wits. But I do not wonder, for perhaps those\nceaseless strokes may have confused thy brain.\"\n\"All that may be,\" replied Sancho, \"but I know that as to my story, all that can be said is that it ends there\nwhere the mistake in the count of the passage of the goats begins.\"\n\"Let it end where it will, well and good,\" said Don Quixote, \"and let us see if Rocinante can go;\" and\nagain he spurred him, and again Rocinante made jumps and remained where he was, so well tied was he.\nJust then, whether it was the cold of the morning that was now approaching, or that he had eaten\nsomething laxative at supper, or that it was only natural (as is most likely), Sancho felt a desire to do what\nno one could do for him; but so great was the fear that had penetrated his heart, he dared not separate\nhimself from his master by as much as the black of his nail; to escape doing what he wanted was,\nhowever, also impossible; so what he did for peace's sake was to remove his right hand, which held the\nback of the saddle, and with it to untie gently and silently the running string which alone held up his\nbreeches, so that on loosening it they at once fell down round his feet like fetters; he then raised his shirt\nas well as he could and bared his hind quarters, no slim ones. But, this accomplished, which he fancied\nwas all he had to do to get out of this terrible strait and embarrassment, another still greater difficulty\npresented itself, for it seemed to him impossible to relieve himself without making some noise, and he\nground his teeth and squeezed his shoulders together, holding his breath as much as he could; but in spite\nof his precautions he was unlucky enough after all to make a little noise, very different from that which\nwas causing him so much fear.\nDon Quixote, hearing it, said, \"What noise is that, Sancho?\"\n\"I don't know, senor,\" said he; \"it must be something new, for adventures and misadventures never begin\nwith a trifle.\" Once more he tried his luck, and succeeded so well, that without any further noise or\ndisturbance he found himself relieved of the burden that had given him so much discomfort. But as Don\nQuixote's sense of smell was as acute as his hearing, and as Sancho was so closely linked with him that\nthe fumes rose almost in a straight line, it could not be but that some should reach his nose, and as soon as\nthey did he came to its relief by compressing it between his fingers, saying in a rather snuffing tone,\n\"Sancho, it strikes me thou art in great fear.\"\n-60\n\n\"I am,\" answered Sancho; \"but how does your worship perceive it now more than ever?\"\n\"Because just now thou smellest stronger than ever, and not of ambergris,\" answered Don Quixote.\n\"Very likely,\" said Sancho, \"but that's not my fault, but your worship's, for leading me about at\nunseasonable hours and at such unwonted paces.\"\n\"Then go back three or four, my friend,\" said Don Quixote, all the time with his fingers to his nose; \"and\nfor the future pay more attention to thy person and to what thou owest to mine; for it is my great\nfamiliarity with thee that has bred this contempt.\"\n\"I'll bet,\" replied Sancho, \"that your worship thinks I have done something I ought not with my person.\"\n\"It makes it worse to stir it, friend Sancho,\" returned Don Quixote.\nWith this and other talk of the same sort master and man passed the night, till Sancho, perceiving that\ndaybreak was coming on apace, very cautiously untied Rocinante and tied up his breeches. As soon as\nRocinante found himself free, though by nature he was not at all mettlesome, he seemed to feel lively and\nbegan pawing--for as to capering, begging his pardon, he knew not what it meant. Don Quixote, then,\nobserving that Rocinante could move, took it as a good sign and a signal that he should attempt the dread\nadventure. By this time day had fully broken and everything showed distinctly, and Don Quixote saw that\nhe was among some tall trees, chestnuts, which cast a very deep shade; he perceived likewise that the\nsound of the strokes did not cease, but could not discover what caused it, and so without any further delay\nhe let Rocinante feel the spur, and once more taking leave of Sancho, he told him to wait for him there\nthree days at most, as he had said before, and if he should not have returned by that time, he might feel\nsure it had been God's will that he should end his days in that perilous adventure. He again repeated the\nmessage and commission with which he was to go on his behalf to his lady Dulcinea, and said he was not\nto be uneasy as to the payment of his services, for before leaving home he had made his will, in which he\nwould find himself fully recompensed in the matter of wages in due proportion to the time he had served;\nbut if God delivered him safe, sound, and unhurt out of that danger, he might look upon the promised\nisland as much more than certain. Sancho began to weep afresh on again hearing the affecting words of\nhis good master, and resolved to stay with him until the final issue and end of the business. From these\ntears and this honourable resolve of Sancho Panza's the author of this history infers that he must have\nbeen of good birth and at least an old Christian; and the feeling he displayed touched his but not so much\nas to make him show any weakness; on the contrary, hiding what he felt as well as he could, he began to\nmove towards that quarter whence the sound of the water and of the strokes seemed to come.\nSancho followed him on foot, leading by the halter, as his custom was, his ass, his constant comrade in\nprosperity or adversity; and advancing some distance through the shady chestnut trees they came upon a\nlittle meadow at the foot of some high rocks, down which a mighty rush of water flung itself. At the foot\nof the rocks were some rudely constructed houses looking more like ruins than houses, from among\nwhich came, they perceived, the din and clatter of blows, which still continued without intermission.\nRocinante took fright at the noise of the water and of the blows, but quieting him Don Quixote advanced\nstep by step towards the houses, commending himself with all his heart to his lady, imploring her support\nin that dread pass and enterprise, and on the way commending himself to God, too, not to forget him.\nSancho who never quitted his side, stretched his neck as far as he could and peered between the legs of\nRocinante to see if he could now discover what it was that caused him such fear and apprehension. They\nwent it might be a hundred paces farther, when on turning a corner the true cause, beyond the possibility\nof any mistake, of that dread-sounding and to them awe-inspiring noise that had kept them all the night in\nsuch fear and perplexity, appeared plain and obvious; and it was (if, reader, thou art not bitter and\ndisappointed) six fulling hammers which by their alternate strokes made all the din.\n-61\n\nWhen Don Quixote perceived what it was, he was struck dumb and rigid from head to foot. Sancho\nglanced at him and saw him with his head bent down upon his breast in manifest mortification; and Don\nQuixote glanced at Sancho and saw him with his cheeks puffed out and his mouth full of laughter, and\nevidently ready to explode with it, and in spite of his vexation he could not help laughing at the sight of\nhim; and when Sancho saw his master begin he let go so heartily that he had to hold his sides with both\nhands to keep himself from bursting with laughter. Four times he stopped, and as many times did his\nlaughter break out afresh with the same violence as at first, whereat Don Quixote grew furious, above all\nwhen he heard him say mockingly, \"Thou must know, friend Sancho, that of Heaven's will I was born in\nthis our iron age to revive in it the golden or age of gold; I am he for whom are reserved perils, mighty\nachievements, valiant deeds;\" and here he went on repeating the words that Don Quixote uttered the first\ntime they heard the awful strokes.\nDon Quixote, then, seeing that Sancho was turning him into ridicule, was so mortified and vexed that he\nlifted up his pike and smote him two such blows that if, instead of catching them on his shoulders, he had\ncaught them on his head there would have been no wages to pay, unless indeed to his heirs. Sancho seeing\nthat he was getting an awkward return in earnest for his jest, and fearing his master might carry it still\nfurther, said to him very humbly, \"Calm yourself, sir, for by God I am only joking.\"\n\"Well, then, if you are joking I am not,\" replied Don Quixote. \"Look here, my lively gentleman, if these,\ninstead of being fulling hammers, had been some perilous adventure, have I not, think you, shown the\ncourage required for the attempt and achievement? Am I, perchance, being, as I am, a gentleman, bound\nto know and distinguish sounds and tell whether they come from fulling mills or not; and that, when\nperhaps, as is the case, I have never in my life seen any as you have, low boor as you are, that have been\nborn and bred among them? But turn me these six hammers into six giants, and bring them to beard me,\none by one or all together, and if I do not knock them head over heels, then make what mockery you like\nof me.\"\n\"No more of that, senor,\" returned Sancho; \"I own I went a little too far with the joke. But tell me, your\nworship, now that peace is made between us (and may God bring you out of all the adventures that may\nbefall you as safe and sound as he has brought you out of this one), was it not a thing to laugh at, and is it\nnot a good story, the great fear we were in?--at least that I was in; for as to your worship I see now that\nyou neither know nor understand what either fear or dismay is.\"\n\"I do not deny,\" said Don Quixote, \"that what happened to us may be worth laughing at, but it is not\nworth making a story about, for it is not everyone that is shrewd enough to hit the right point of a thing.\"\n\"At any rate,\" said Sancho, \"your worship knew how to hit the right point with your pike, aiming at my\nhead and hitting me on the shoulders, thanks be to God and my own smartness in dodging it. But let that\npass; all will come out in the scouring; for I have heard say 'he loves thee well that makes thee weep;'\nand moreover that it is the way with great lords after any hard words they give a servant to give him a pair\nof breeches; though I do not know what they give after blows, unless it be that knights-errant after blows\ngive islands, or kingdoms on the mainland.\"\n\"It may be on the dice,\" said Don Quixote, \"that all thou sayest will come true; overlook the past, for thou\nart shrewd enough to know that our first movements are not in our own control; and one thing for the\nfuture bear in mind, that thou curb and restrain thy loquacity in my company; for in all the books of\nchivalry that I have read, and they are innumerable, I never met with a squire who talked so much to his\nlord as thou dost to thine; and in fact I feel it to be a great fault of thine and of mine: of thine, that thou\nhast so little respect for me; of mine, that I do not make myself more respected. There was Gandalin, the\nsquire of Amadis of Gaul, that was Count of the Insula Firme, and we read of him that he always\naddressed his lord with his cap in his hand, his head bowed down and his body bent double, more\n-62\n\nturquesco. And then, what shall we say of Gasabal, the squire of Galaor, who was so silent that in order to\nindicate to us the greatness of his marvellous taciturnity his name is only once mentioned in the whole of\nthat history, as long as it is truthful? From all I have said thou wilt gather, Sancho, that there must be a\ndifference between master and man, between lord and lackey, between knight and squire: so that from this\nday forward in our intercourse we must observe more respect and take less liberties, for in whatever way I\nmay be provoked with you it will be bad for the pitcher. The favours and benefits that I have promised\nyou will come in due time, and if they do not your wages at least will not be lost, as I have already told\nyou.\"\n\"All that your worship says is very well,\" said Sancho, \"but I should like to know (in case the time of\nfavours should not come, and it might be necessary to fall back upon wages) how much did the squire of a\nknight-errant get in those days, and did they agree by the month, or by the day like bricklayers?\"\n\"I do not believe,\" replied Don Quixote, \"that such squires were ever on wages, but were dependent on\nfavour; and if I have now mentioned thine in the sealed will I have left at home, it was with a view to\nwhat may happen; for as yet I know not how chivalry will turn out in these wretched times of ours, and I\ndo not wish my soul to suffer for trifles in the other world; for I would have thee know, Sancho, that in\nthis there is no condition more hazardous than that of adventurers.\"\n\"That is true,\" said Sancho, \"since the mere noise of the hammers of a fulling mill can disturb and\ndisquiet the heart of such a valiant errant adventurer as your worship; but you may be sure I will not open\nmy lips henceforward to make light of anything of your worship's, but only to honour you as my master\nand natural lord.\"\n\"By so doing,\" replied Don Quixote, \"shalt thou live long on the face of the earth; for next after parents,\nwe are bound to respect our masters.\"\nCHAPTER XXI.\nWHICH TREATS OF THE EXALTED ADVENTURE AND RICH PRIZE OF MAMBRINO'S\nHELMET, TOGETHER WITH OTHER THINGS THAT HAPPENED TO OUR INVINCIBLE KNIGHT\nIt now began to rain a little, and Sancho was for going into the fulling mills, but Don Quixote had taken\nsuch an abhorrence to them on account of the recent joke that he would not enter them on any account; so\nturning aside to right they came upon another road, different from that which they had taken the night\nbefore. Shortly afterwards Don Quixote perceived a man on horseback who wore on his head something\nthat shone like gold, and the moment he saw him he turned to Sancho and said:\n\"I think, Sancho, there is no proverb that is not true, all being maxims drawn from experience itself, the\nmother of all the sciences, especially that one that says, 'Where one door shuts, another opens.' I say so\nbecause if last night fortune shut the door of the adventure we were looking for against us, cheating us\nwith the fulling mills, it now opens wide another one for another better and more certain adventure, and if\nI do not contrive to enter it, it will be my own fault, and I cannot lay it to my ignorance of fulling mills, or\nthe darkness of the night. I say this because, if I mistake not, there comes towards us one who wears on\nhis head the helmet of Mambrino, concerning which I took the oath thou rememberest.\"\n\"Mind what you say, your worship, and still more what you do,\" said Sancho, \"for I don't want any more\nfulling mills to finish off fulling and knocking our senses out.\"\n\"The devil take thee, man,\" said Don Quixote; \"what has a helmet to do with fulling mills?\"\n-63\n\n\"I don't know,\" replied Sancho, \"but, faith, if I might speak as I used, perhaps I could give such reasons\nthat your worship would see you were mistaken in what you say.\"\n\"How can I be mistaken in what I say, unbelieving traitor?\" returned Don Quixote; \"tell me, seest thou\nnot yonder knight coming towards us on a dappled grey steed, who has upon his head a helmet of gold?\"\n\"What I see and make out,\" answered Sancho, \"is only a man on a grey ass like my own, who has\nsomething that shines on his head.\"\n\"Well, that is the helmet of Mambrino,\" said Don Quixote; \"stand to one side and leave me alone with\nhim; thou shalt see how, without saying a word, to save time, I shall bring this adventure to an issue and\npossess myself of the helmet I have so longed for.\"\n\"I will take care to stand aside,\" said Sancho; \"but God grant, I say once more, that it may be marjoram\nand not fulling mills.\"\n\"I have told thee, brother, on no account to mention those fulling mills to me again,\" said Don Quixote,\n\"or I vow--and I say no more-I'll full the soul out of you.\"\nSancho held his peace in dread lest his master should carry out the vow he had hurled like a bowl at him.\nThe fact of the matter as regards the helmet, steed, and knight that Don Quixote saw, was this. In that\nneighbourhood there were two villages, one of them so small that it had neither apothecary's shop nor\nbarber, which the other that was close to it had, so the barber of the larger served the smaller, and in it\nthere was a sick man who required to be bled and another man who wanted to be shaved, and on this\nerrand the barber was going, carrying with him a brass basin; but as luck would have it, as he was on the\nway it began to rain, and not to spoil his hat, which probably was a new one, he put the basin on his head,\nand being clean it glittered at half a league's distance. He rode upon a grey ass, as Sancho said, and this\nwas what made it seem to Don Quixote to be a dapple-grey steed and a knight and a golden helmet; for\neverything he saw he made to fall in with his crazy chivalry and ill-errant notions; and when he saw the\npoor knight draw near, without entering into any parley with him, at Rocinante's top speed he bore down\nupon him with the pike pointed low, fully determined to run him through and through, and as he reached\nhim, without checking the fury of his charge, he cried to him:\n\"Defend thyself, miserable being, or yield me of thine own accord that which is so reasonably my due.\"\nThe barber, who without any expectation or apprehension of it saw this apparition coming down upon\nhim, had no other way of saving himself from the stroke of the lance but to let himself fall off his ass; and\nno sooner had he touched the ground than he sprang up more nimbly than a deer and sped away across the\nplain faster than the wind.\nHe left the basin on the ground, with which Don Quixote contented himself, saying that the pagan had\nshown his discretion and imitated the beaver, which finding itself pressed by the hunters bites and cuts off\nwith its teeth that for which, by its natural instinct, it knows it is pursued.\nHe told Sancho to pick up the helmet, and he taking it in his hands said:\n\"By God the basin is a good one, and worth a real of eight if it is worth a maravedis,\" and handed it to his\nmaster, who immediately put it on his head, turning it round, now this way, now that, in search of fitment,\nand not finding it he said, \"Clearly the pagan to whose measure this famous head-piece was first forged\nmust have had a very large head; but the worst of it is half of it is wanting.\"\n-64\n\nWhen Sancho heard him call the basin a headpiece he was unable to restrain his laughter, but\nremembering his master's wrath he checked himself in the midst of it.\n\"What art thou laughing at, Sancho?\" said Don Quixote.\n\"I am laughing,\" said he, \"to think of the great head the pagan must have had who owned this helmet, for\nit looks exactly like a regular barber's basin.\"\n\"Dost thou know what I suspect, Sancho?\" said Don Quixote; \"that this wonderful piece of this enchanted\nhelmet must by some strange accident have come into the hands of some one who was unable to\nrecognise or realise its value, and who, not knowing what he did, and seeing it to be of the purest gold,\nmust have melted down one half for the sake of what it might be worth, and of the other made this which\nis like a barber's basin as thou sayest; but be it as it may, to me who recognise it, its transformation makes\nno difference, for I will set it to rights at the first village where there is a blacksmith, and in such style that\nthat helmet the god of smithies forged for the god of battles shall not surpass it or even come up to it; and\nin the meantime I will wear it as well as I can, for something is better than nothing; all the more as it will\nbe quite enough to protect me from any chance blow of a stone.\"\n\"That is,\" said Sancho, \"if it is not shot with a sling as they were in the battle of the two armies, when\nthey signed the cross on your worship's grinders and smashed the flask with that blessed draught that\nmade me vomit my bowels up.\"\n\"It does not grieve me much to have lost it,\" said Don Quixote, \"for thou knowest, Sancho, that I have the\nreceipt in my memory.\"\n\"So have I,\" answered Sancho, \"but if ever I make it, or try it again as long as I live, may this be my last\nhour; moreover, I have no intention of putting myself in the way of wanting it, for I mean, with all my\nfive senses, to keep myself from being wounded or from wounding anyone: as to being blanketed again I\nsay nothing, for it is hard to prevent mishaps of that sort, and if they come there is nothing for it but to\nsqueeze our shoulders together, hold our breath, shut our eyes, and let ourselves go where luck and the\nblanket may send us.\"\n\"Thou art a bad Christian, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote on hearing this, \"for once an injury has been done\nthee thou never forgettest it: but know that it is the part of noble and generous hearts not to attach\nimportance to trifles. What lame leg hast thou got by it, what broken rib, what cracked head, that thou\ncanst not forget that jest? For jest and sport it was, properly regarded, and had I not seen it in that light I\nwould have returned and done more mischief in revenging thee than the Greeks did for the rape of Helen,\nwho, if she were alive now, or if my Dulcinea had lived then, might depend upon it she would not be so\nfamous for her beauty as she is;\" and here he heaved a sigh and sent it aloft; and said Sancho, \"Let it pass\nfor a jest as it cannot be revenged in earnest, but I know what sort of jest and earnest it was, and I know it\nwill never be rubbed out of my memory any more than off my shoulders. But putting that aside, will your\nworship tell me what are we to do with this dapple-grey steed that looks like a grey ass, which that\nMartino that your worship overthrew has left deserted here? for, from the way he took to his heels and\nbolted, he is not likely ever to come back for it; and by my beard but the grey is a good one.\"\n\"I have never been in the habit,\" said Don Quixote, \"of taking spoil of those whom I vanquish, nor is it\nthe practice of chivalry to take away their horses and leave them to go on foot, unless indeed it be that the\nvictor have lost his own in the combat, in which case it is lawful to take that of the vanquished as a thing\nwon in lawful war; therefore, Sancho, leave this horse, or ass, or whatever thou wilt have it to be; for\nwhen its owner sees us gone hence he will come back for it.\"\n-65\n\n\"God knows I should like to take it,\" returned Sancho, \"or at least to change it for my own, which does\nnot seem to me as good a one: verily the laws of chivalry are strict, since they cannot be stretched to let\none ass be changed for another; I should like to know if I might at least change trappings.\"\n\"On that head I am not quite certain,\" answered Don Quixote, \"and the matter being doubtful, pending\nbetter information, I say thou mayest change them, if so be thou hast urgent need of them.\"\n\"So urgent is it,\" answered Sancho, \"that if they were for my own person I could not want them more;\"\nand forthwith, fortified by this licence, he decked out his ass with a thousand fineries, making quite\nanother animal of him. This done, they broke their fast on the remains of the spoils of war plundered from\nthe sumpter mule, and drank of the brook that flowed from the fulling mills, without casting a look in that\ndirection, in such loathing did they hold them for the alarm they had caused them; and, all anger and\ngloom removed, they mounted and, without taking any fixed road (not to fix upon any being the proper\nthing for true knights-errant), they set out, guided by Rocinante's will, which carried along with it that of\nhis master, not to say that of the ass, which always followed him wherever he led, lovingly and sociably;\nnevertheless they returned to the high road, and pursued it at a venture without any other aim.\nAs they went along, then, in this way Sancho said to his master, \"Senor, would your worship give me\nleave to speak a little to you? For since you laid that hard injunction of silence on me several things have\ngone to rot in my stomach, and I have now just one on the tip of my tongue that I don't want to be\nspoiled.\"\n\"Say, on, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"and be brief in thy discourse, for there is no pleasure in one that is\nlong.\"\n\"Well then, senor,\" returned Sancho, \"I say that for some days past I have been considering how little is\ngot or gained by going in search of these adventures that your worship seeks in these wilds and\ncross-roads, where, even if the most perilous are victoriously achieved, there is no one to see or know of\nthem, and so they must be left untold for ever, to the loss of your worship's object and the credit they\ndeserve; therefore it seems to me it would be better (saving your worship's better judgment) if we were to\ngo and serve some emperor or other great prince who may have some war on hand, in whose service your\nworship may prove the worth of your person, your great might, and greater understanding, on perceiving\nwhich the lord in whose service we may be will perforce have to reward us, each according to his merits;\nand there you will not be at a loss for some one to set down your achievements in writing so as to\npreserve their memory for ever. Of my own I say nothing, as they will not go beyond squirely limits,\nthough I make bold to say that, if it be the practice in chivalry to write the achievements of squires, I think\nmine must not be left out.\"\n\"Thou speakest not amiss, Sancho,\" answered Don Quixote, \"but before that point is reached it is\nrequisite to roam the world, as it were on probation, seeking adventures, in order that, by achieving some,\nname and fame may be acquired, such that when he betakes himself to the court of some great monarch\nthe knight may be already known by his deeds, and that the boys, the instant they see him enter the gate\nof the city, may all follow him and surround him, crying, 'This is the Knight of the Sun'-or the Serpent,\nor any other title under which he may have achieved great deeds. 'This,' they will say, 'is he who\nvanquished in single combat the gigantic Brocabruno of mighty strength; he who delivered the great\nMameluke of Persia out of the long enchantment under which he had been for almost nine hundred\nyears.' So from one to another they will go proclaiming his achievements; and presently at the tumult of\nthe boys and the others the king of that kingdom will appear at the windows of his royal palace, and as\nsoon as he beholds the knight, recognising him by his arms and the device on his shield, he will as a\nmatter of course say, 'What ho! Forth all ye, the knights of my court, to receive the flower of chivalry\nwho cometh hither!' At which command all will issue forth, and he himself, advancing half-way down the\n-66\n\nstairs, will embrace him closely, and salute him, kissing him on the cheek, and will then lead him to the\nqueen's chamber, where the knight will find her with the princess her daughter, who will be one of the\nmost beautiful and accomplished damsels that could with the utmost pains be discovered anywhere in the\nknown world. Straightway it will come to pass that she will fix her eyes upon the knight and he his upon\nher, and each will seem to the other something more divine than human, and, without knowing how or\nwhy they will be taken and entangled in the inextricable toils of love, and sorely distressed in their hearts\nnot to see any way of making their pains and sufferings known by speech. Thence they will lead him, no\ndoubt, to some richly adorned chamber of the palace, where, having removed his armour, they will bring\nhim a rich mantle of scarlet wherewith to robe himself, and if he looked noble in his armour he will look\nstill more so in a doublet. When night comes he will sup with the king, queen, and princess; and all the\ntime he will never take his eyes off her, stealing stealthy glances, unnoticed by those present, and she will\ndo the same, and with equal cautiousness, being, as I have said, a damsel of great discretion. The tables\nbeing removed, suddenly through the door of the hall there will enter a hideous and diminutive dwarf\nfollowed by a fair dame, between two giants, who comes with a certain adventure, the work of an ancient\nsage; and he who shall achieve it shall be deemed the best knight in the world.\n\"The king will then command all those present to essay it, and none will bring it to an end and conclusion\nsave the stranger knight, to the great enhancement of his fame, whereat the princess will be overjoyed and\nwill esteem herself happy and fortunate in having fixed and placed her thoughts so high. And the best of it\nis that this king, or prince, or whatever he is, is engaged in a very bitter war with another as powerful as\nhimself, and the stranger knight, after having been some days at his court, requests leave from him to go\nand serve him in the said war. The king will grant it very readily, and the knight will courteously kiss his\nhands for the favour done to him; and that night he will take leave of his lady the princess at the grating of\nthe chamber where she sleeps, which looks upon a garden, and at which he has already many times\nconversed with her, the go-between and confidante in the matter being a damsel much trusted by the\nprincess. He will sigh, she will swoon, the damsel will fetch water, much distressed because morning\napproaches, and for the honour of her lady he would not that they were discovered; at last the princess\nwill come to herself and will present her white hands through the grating to the knight, who will kiss them\na thousand and a thousand times, bathing them with his tears. It will be arranged between them how they\nare to inform each other of their good or evil fortunes, and the princess will entreat him to make his\nabsence as short as possible, which he will promise to do with many oaths; once more he kisses her\nhands, and takes his leave in such grief that he is well-nigh ready to die. He betakes him thence to his\nchamber, flings himself on his bed, cannot sleep for sorrow at parting, rises early in the morning, goes to\ntake leave of the king, queen, and princess, and, as he takes his leave of the pair, it is told him that the\nprincess is indisposed and cannot receive a visit; the knight thinks it is from grief at his departure, his\nheart is pierced, and he is hardly able to keep from showing his pain. The confidante is present, observes\nall, goes to tell her mistress, who listens with tears and says that one of her greatest distresses is not\nknowing who this knight is, and whether he is of kingly lineage or not; the damsel assures her that so\nmuch courtesy, gentleness, and gallantry of bearing as her knight possesses could not exist in any save\none who was royal and illustrious; her anxiety is thus relieved, and she strives to be of good cheer lest she\nshould excite suspicion in her parents, and at the end of two days she appears in public. Meanwhile the\nknight has taken his departure; he fights in the war, conquers the king's enemy, wins many cities,\ntriumphs in many battles, returns to the court, sees his lady where he was wont to see her, and it is agreed\nthat he shall demand her in marriage of her parents as the reward of his services; the king is unwilling to\ngive her, as he knows not who he is, but nevertheless, whether carried off or in whatever other way it may\nbe, the princess comes to be his bride, and her father comes to regard it as very good fortune; for it so\nhappens that this knight is proved to be the son of a valiant king of some kingdom, I know not what, for I\nfancy it is not likely to be on the map. The father dies, the princess inherits, and in two words the knight\nbecomes king. And here comes in at once the bestowal of rewards upon his squire and all who have aided\nhim in rising to so exalted a rank. He marries his squire to a damsel of the princess's, who will be, no\ndoubt, the one who was confidante in their amour, and is daughter of a very great duke.\"\n-67\n\n\"That's what I want, and no mistake about it!\" said Sancho. \"That's what I'm waiting for; for all this,\nword for word, is in store for your worship under the title of the Knight of Regretful Appearance.\"\n\"Thou needst not doubt it, Sancho,\" replied Don Quixote, \"for in the same manner, and by the same steps\nas I have described here, knights-errant rise and have risen to be kings and emperors; all we want now is\nto find out what king, Christian or pagan, is at war and has a beautiful daughter; but there will be time\nenough to think of that, for, as I have told thee, fame must be won in other quarters before repairing to the\ncourt. There is another thing, too, that is wanting; for supposing we find a king who is at war and has a\nbeautiful daughter, and that I have won incredible fame throughout the universe, I know not how it can be\nmade out that I am of royal lineage, or even second cousin to an emperor; for the king will not be willing\nto give me his daughter in marriage unless he is first thoroughly satisfied on this point, however much my\nfamous deeds may deserve it; so that by this deficiency I fear I shall lose what my arm has fairly earned.\nTrue it is I am a gentleman of known house, of estate and property, and entitled to the five hundred\nsueldos mulct; and it may be that the sage who shall write my history will so clear up my ancestry and\npedigree that I may find myself fifth or sixth in descent from a king; for I would have thee know, Sancho,\nthat there are two kinds of lineages in the world; some there be tracing and deriving their descent from\nkings and princes, whom time has reduced little by little until they end in a point like a pyramid upside\ndown; and others who spring from the common herd and go on rising step by step until they come to be\ngreat lords; so that the difference is that the one were what they no longer are, and the others are what\nthey formerly were not. And I may be of such that after investigation my origin may prove great and\nfamous, with which the king, my father-in-law that is to be, ought to be satisfied; and should he not be,\nthe princess will so love me that even though she well knew me to be the son of a water-mule-driver, she\nwill take me for her lord and husband in spite of her father; if not, then it comes to seizing her and\ncarrying her off where I please; for time or death will put an end to the wrath of her parents.\"\n\"It comes to this, too,\" said Sancho, \"what some naughty people say, 'Never ask as a favour what thou\ncanst take by force;' though it would fit better to say, 'A clear escape is better than good men's prayers.' I\nsay so because if my lord the king, your worship's father-in-law, will not condescend to give you my lady\nthe princess, there is nothing for it but, as your worship says, to seize her and transport her. But the\nmischief is that until peace is made and you come into the peaceful enjoyment of your kingdom, the poor\nsquire is famishing as far as rewards go, unless it be that the confidante damsel that is to be his wife\ncomes with the princess, and that with her he tides over his bad luck until Heaven otherwise orders things;\nfor his master, I suppose, may as well give her to him at once for a lawful wife.\"\n\"Nobody can object to that,\" said Don Quixote.\n\"Then since that may be,\" said Sancho, \"there is nothing for it but to commend ourselves to God, and let\nfortune take what course it will.\"\n\"God guide it according to my wishes and thy wants,\" said Don Quixote, \"and mean be he who thinks\nhimself mean.\"\n\"In God's name let him be so,\" said Sancho: \"I am an old Christian, and to fit me for a count that's\nenough.\"\n\"And more than enough for thee,\" said Don Quixote; \"and even wert thou not, it would make no\ndifference, because I being the king can easily give thee nobility without purchase or service rendered by\nthee, for when I make thee a count, then thou art at once a gentleman; and they may say what they will,\nbut by my faith they will have to call thee 'your lordship,' whether they like it or not.\"\n\"Not a doubt of it; and I'll know how to support the tittle,\" said Sancho.\n-68\n\n\"Title thou shouldst say, not tittle,\" said his master.\n\"So be it,\" answered Sancho. \"I say I will know how to behave, for once in my life I was beadle of a\nbrotherhood, and the beadle's gown sat so well on me that all said I looked as if I was to be steward of the\nsame brotherhood. What will it be, then, when I put a duke's robe on my back, or dress myself in gold\nand pearls like a count? I believe they'll come a hundred leagues to see me.\"\n\"Thou wilt look well,\" said Don Quixote, \"but thou must shave thy beard often, for thou hast it so thick\nand rough and unkempt, that if thou dost not shave it every second day at least, they will see what thou art\nat the distance of a musket shot.\"\n\"What more will it be,\" said Sancho, \"than having a barber, and keeping him at wages in the house? and\neven if it be necessary, I will make him go behind me like a nobleman's equerry.\"\n\"Why, how dost thou know that noblemen have equerries behind them?\" asked Don Quixote.\n\"I will tell you,\" answered Sancho. \"Years ago I was for a month at the capital and there I saw taking the\nair a very small gentleman who they said was a very great man, and a man following him on horseback in\nevery turn he took, just as if he was his tail. I asked why this man did not join the other man, instead of\nalways going behind him; they answered me that he was his equerry, and that it was the custom with\nnobles to have such persons behind them, and ever since then I know it, for I have never forgotten it.\"\n\"Thou art right,\" said Don Quixote, \"and in the same way thou mayest carry thy barber with thee, for\ncustoms did not come into use all together, nor were they all invented at once, and thou mayest be the\nfirst count to have a barber to follow him; and, indeed, shaving one's beard is a greater trust than saddling\none's horse.\"\n\"Let the barber business be my look-out,\" said Sancho; \"and your worship's be it to strive to become a\nking, and make me a count.\"\n\"So it shall be,\" answered Don Quixote, and raising his eyes he saw what will be told in the following\nchapter.\nCHAPTER XXII.\nOF THE FREEDOM DON QUIXOTE CONFERRED ON SEVERAL UNFORTUNATES WHO\nAGAINST THEIR WILL WERE BEING CARRIED WHERE THEY HAD NO WISH TO GO\nCide Hamete Benengeli, the Arab and Manchegan author, relates in this most grave, high-sounding,\nminute, delightful, and original history that after the discussion between the famous Don Quixote of La\nMancha and his squire Sancho Panza which is set down at the end of chapter twenty-one, Don Quixote\nraised his eyes and saw coming along the road he was following some dozen men on foot strung together\nby the neck, like beads, on a great iron chain, and all with manacles on their hands. With them there came\nalso two men on horseback and two on foot; those on horseback with wheel-lock muskets, those on foot\nwith javelins and swords, and as soon as Sancho saw them he said:\n\"That is a chain of galley slaves, on the way to the galleys by force of the king's orders.\"\n\"How by force?\" asked Don Quixote; \"is it possible that the king uses force against anyone?\"\n\"I do not say that,\" answered Sancho, \"but that these are people condemned for their crimes to serve by\n-69\n\nforce in the king's galleys.\"\n\"In fact,\" replied Don Quixote, \"however it may be, these people are going where they are taking them by\nforce, and not of their own will.\"\n\"Just so,\" said Sancho.\n\"Then if so,\" said Don Quixote, \"here is a case for the exercise of my office, to put down force and to\nsuccour and help the wretched.\"\n\"Recollect, your worship,\" said Sancho, \"Justice, which is the king himself, is not using force or doing\nwrong to such persons, but punishing them for their crimes.\"\nThe chain of galley slaves had by this time come up, and Don Quixote in very courteous language asked\nthose who were in custody of it to be good enough to tell him the reason or reasons for which they were\nconducting these people in this manner. One of the guards on horseback answered that they were galley\nslaves belonging to his majesty, that they were going to the galleys, and that was all that was to be said\nand all he had any business to know.\n\"Nevertheless,\" replied Don Quixote, \"I should like to know from each of them separately the reason of\nhis misfortune;\" to this he added more to the same effect to induce them to tell him what he wanted so\ncivilly that the other mounted guard said to him:\n\"Though we have here the register and certificate of the sentence of every one of these wretches, this is no\ntime to take them out or read them; come and ask themselves; they can tell if they choose, and they will,\nfor these fellows take a pleasure in doing and talking about rascalities.\"\nWith this permission, which Don Quixote would have taken even had they not granted it, he approached\nthe chain and asked the first for what offences he was now in such a sorry case.\nHe made answer that it was for being a lover.\n\"For that only?\" replied Don Quixote; \"why, if for being lovers they send people to the galleys I might\nhave been rowing in them long ago.\"\n\"The love is not the sort your worship is thinking of,\" said the galley slave; \"mine was that I loved a\nwasherwoman's basket of clean linen so well, and held it so close in my embrace, that if the arm of the\nlaw had not forced it from me, I should never have let it go of my own will to this moment; I was caught\nin the act, there was no occasion for torture, the case was settled, they treated me to a hundred lashes on\nthe back, and three years of gurapas besides, and that was the end of it.\"\n\"What are gurapas?\" asked Don Quixote.\n\"Gurapas are galleys,\" answered the galley slave, who was a young man of about four-and-twenty, and\nsaid he was a native of Piedrahita.\nDon Quixote asked the same question of the second, who made no reply, so downcast and melancholy\nwas he; but the first answered for him, and said, \"He, sir, goes as a canary, I mean as a musician and a\nsinger.\"\n\"What!\" said Don Quixote, \"for being musicians and singers are people sent to the galleys too?\"\n-70\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" answered the galley slave, \"for there is nothing worse than singing under suffering.\"\n\"On the contrary, I have heard say,\" said Don Quixote, \"that he who sings scares away his woes.\"\n\"Here it is the reverse,\" said the galley slave; \"for he who sings once weeps all his life.\"\n\"I do not understand it,\" said Don Quixote; but one of the guards said to him, \"Sir, to sing under suffering\nmeans to confess under torture; they put this sinner to the torture and he confessed his crime, which was\nbeing a cattle-stealer, and on his confession they sentenced him to six years in the galleys, besides two\nhundred lashes that he has already had on the back; and he is always dejected and downcast because the\nother thieves that were left behind and that march here ill-treat, and snub, and jeer, and despise him for\nconfessing and not having spirit enough to say nay; for, say they, 'nay' has no more letters in it than\n'yea,' and a culprit is well off when life or death with him depends on his own tongue and not on that of\nwitnesses or evidence; and to my thinking they are not very far out.\"\n\"And I think so too,\" answered Don Quixote; then passing on to the third he asked him what he had asked\nthe others, and the man answered very readily and unconcernedly, \"I am going for five years to their\nladyships the gurapas for the want of ten ducats.\"\n\"I will give twenty with pleasure to get you out of that trouble,\" said Don Quixote.\n\"That,\" said the galley slave, \"is like a man having money at sea when he is dying of hunger and has no\nway of buying what he wants; I say so because if at the right time I had had those twenty ducats that your\nworship now offers me, I would have greased the notary's pen and freshened up the attorney's wit with\nthem, so that to-day I should be in the middle of the plaza of the Zocodover at Toledo, and not on this\nroad coupled like a greyhound. But God is great; patience--there, that's enough of it.\"\nDon Quixote passed on to the fourth, a man of venerable aspect with a white beard falling below his\nbreast, who on hearing himself asked the reason of his being there began to weep without answering a\nword, but the fifth acted as his tongue and said, \"This worthy man is going to the galleys for four years,\nafter having gone the rounds in ceremony and on horseback.\"\n\"That means,\" said Sancho Panza, \"as I take it, to have been exposed to shame in public.\"\n\"Just so,\" replied the galley slave, \"and the offence for which they gave him that punishment was having\nbeen an ear-broker, nay body-broker; I mean, in short, that this gentleman goes as a pimp, and for having\nbesides a certain touch of the sorcerer about him.\"\n\"If that touch had not been thrown in,\" said Don Quixote, \"he would not deserve, for mere pimping, to\nrow in the galleys, but rather to command and be admiral of them; for the office of pimp is no ordinary\none, being the office of persons of discretion, one very necessary in a well-ordered state, and only to be\nexercised by persons of good birth; nay, there ought to be an inspector and overseer of them, as in other\noffices, and recognised number, as with the brokers on change; in this way many of the evils would be\navoided which are caused by this office and calling being in the hands of stupid and ignorant people, such\nas women more or less silly, and pages and jesters of little standing and experience, who on the most\nurgent occasions, and when ingenuity of contrivance is needed, let the crumbs freeze on the way to their\nmouths, and know not which is their right hand. I should like to go farther, and give reasons to show that\nit is advisable to choose those who are to hold so necessary an office in the state, but this is not the fit\nplace for it; some day I will expound the matter to some one able to see to and rectify it; all I say now is,\nthat the additional fact of his being a sorcerer has removed the sorrow it gave me to see these white hairs\nand this venerable countenance in so painful a position on account of his being a pimp; though I know\n-71\n\nwell there are no sorceries in the world that can move or compel the will as some simple folk fancy, for\nour will is free, nor is there herb or charm that can force it. All that certain silly women and quacks do is\nto turn men mad with potions and poisons, pretending that they have power to cause love, for, as I say, it\nis an impossibility to compel the will.\"\n\"It is true,\" said the good old man, \"and indeed, sir, as far as the charge of sorcery goes I was not guilty;\nas to that of being a pimp I cannot deny it; but I never thought I was doing any harm by it, for my only\nobject was that all the world should enjoy itself and live in peace and quiet, without quarrels or troubles;\nbut my good intentions were unavailing to save me from going where I never expect to come back from,\nwith this weight of years upon me and a urinary ailment that never gives me a moment's ease;\" and again\nhe fell to weeping as before, and such compassion did Sancho feel for him that he took out a real of four\nfrom his bosom and gave it to him in alms.\nDon Quixote went on and asked another what his crime was, and the man answered with no less but\nrather much more sprightliness than the last one.\n\"I am here because I carried the joke too far with a couple of cousins of mine, and with a couple of other\ncousins who were none of mine; in short, I carried the joke so far with them all that it ended in such a\ncomplicated increase of kindred that no accountant could make it clear: it was all proved against me, I got\nno favour, I had no money, I was near having my neck stretched, they sentenced me to the galleys for six\nyears, I accepted my fate, it is the punishment of my fault; I am a young man; let life only last, and with\nthat all will come right. If you, sir, have anything wherewith to help the poor, God will repay it to you in\nheaven, and we on earth will take care in our petitions to him to pray for the life and health of your\nworship, that they may be as long and as good as your amiable appearance deserves.\"\nThis one was in the dress of a student, and one of the guards said he was a great talker and a very elegant\nLatin scholar.\nBehind all these there came a man of thirty, a very personable fellow, except that when he looked, his\neyes turned in a little one towards the other. He was bound differently from the rest, for he had to his leg a\nchain so long that it was wound all round his body, and two rings on his neck, one attached to the chain,\nthe other to what they call a \"keep-friend\" or \"friend's foot,\" from which hung two irons reaching to his\nwaist with two manacles fixed to them in which his hands were secured by a big padlock, so that he could\nneither raise his hands to his mouth nor lower his head to his hands. Don Quixote asked why this man\ncarried so many more chains than the others. The guard replied that it was because he alone had\ncommitted more crimes than all the rest put together, and was so daring and such a villain, that though\nthey marched him in that fashion they did not feel sure of him, but were in dread of his making his\nescape.\n\"What crimes can he have committed,\" said Don Quixote, \"if they have not deserved a heavier\npunishment than being sent to the galleys?\"\n\"He goes for ten years,\" replied the guard, \"which is the same thing as civil death, and all that need be\nsaid is that this good fellow is the famous Gines de Pasamonte, otherwise called Ginesillo de Parapilla.\"\n\"Gently, senor commissary,\" said the galley slave at this, \"let us have no fixing of names or surnames; my\nname is Gines, not Ginesillo, and my family name is Pasamonte, not Parapilla as you say; let each one\nmind his own business, and he will be doing enough.\"\n\"Speak with less impertinence, master thief of extra measure,\" replied the commissary, \"if you don't want\nme to make you hold your tongue in spite of your teeth.\"\n-72\n\n\"It is easy to see,\" returned the galley slave, \"that man goes as God pleases, but some one shall know\nsome day whether I am called Ginesillo de Parapilla or not.\"\n\"Don't they call you so, you liar?\" said the guard.\n\"They do,\" returned Gines, \"but I will make them give over calling me so, or I will be shaved, where, I\nonly say behind my teeth. If you, sir, have anything to give us, give it to us at once, and God speed you,\nfor you are becoming tiresome with all this inquisitiveness about the lives of others; if you want to know\nabout mine, let me tell you I am Gines de Pasamonte, whose life is written by these fingers.\"\n\"He says true,\" said the commissary, \"for he has himself written his story as grand as you please, and has\nleft the book in the prison in pawn for two hundred reals.\"\n\"And I mean to take it out of pawn,\" said Gines, \"though it were in for two hundred ducats.\"\n\"Is it so good?\" said Don Quixote.\n\"So good is it,\" replied Gines, \"that a fig for 'Lazarillo de Tormes,' and all of that kind that have been\nwritten, or shall be written compared with it: all I will say about it is that it deals with facts, and facts so\nneat and diverting that no lies could match them.\"\n\"And how is the book entitled?\" asked Don Quixote.\n\"The 'Life of Gines de Pasamonte,'\" replied the hero of it.\n\"And is it finished?\" asked Don Quixote.\n\"How can it be finished,\" said the other, \"when my life is not yet finished? All that is written is from my\nbirth down to the point when they sent me to the galleys this last time.\"\n\"Then you have been there before?\" said Don Quixote.\n\"In the service of God and the king I have been there for four years before now, and I know by this time\nwhat the biscuit and courbash are like,\" replied Gines; \"and it is no great grievance to me to go back to\nthem, for there I shall have time to finish my book; I have still many things left to say, and in the galleys\nof Spain there is more than enough leisure; though I do not want much for what I have to write, for I have\nit by heart.\"\n\"You seem a clever fellow,\" said Don Quixote.\n\"And an unfortunate one,\" replied Gines, \"for misfortune always persecutes genius.\"\n\"It persecutes rogues,\" said the commissary.\n\"I told you already to go gently, master commissary,\" said Pasamonte; \"their lordships yonder never gave\nyou that staff to ill-treat us wretches here, but to conduct and take us where his majesty orders you; if not,\nby the life of-never mind-; it may be that some day the stains made in the inn will come out in the\nscouring; let everyone hold his tongue and behave well and speak better; and now let us march on, for we\nhave had quite enough of this entertainment.\"\nThe commissary lifted his staff to strike Pasamonte in return for his threats, but Don Quixote came\n-73\n\nbetween them, and begged him not to ill-use him, as it was not too much to allow one who had his hands\ntied to have his tongue a trifle free; and turning to the whole chain of them he said:\n\"From all you have told me, dear brethren, make out clearly that though they have punished you for your\nfaults, the punishments you are about to endure do not give you much pleasure, and that you go to them\nvery much against the grain and against your will, and that perhaps this one's want of courage under\ntorture, that one's want of money, the other's want of advocacy, and lastly the perverted judgment of the\njudge may have been the cause of your ruin and of your failure to obtain the justice you had on your side.\nAll which presents itself now to my mind, urging, persuading, and even compelling me to demonstrate in\nyour case the purpose for which Heaven sent me into the world and caused me to make profession of the\norder of chivalry to which I belong, and the vow I took therein to give aid to those in need and under the\noppression of the strong. But as I know that it is a mark of prudence not to do by foul means what may be\ndone by fair, I will ask these gentlemen, the guards and commissary, to be so good as to release you and\nlet you go in peace, as there will be no lack of others to serve the king under more favourable\ncircumstances; for it seems to me a hard case to make slaves of those whom God and nature have made\nfree. Moreover, sirs of the guard,\" added Don Quixote, \"these poor fellows have done nothing to you; let\neach answer for his own sins yonder; there is a God in Heaven who will not forget to punish the wicked\nor reward the good; and it is not fitting that honest men should be the instruments of punishment to\nothers, they being therein no way concerned. This request I make thus gently and quietly, that, if you\ncomply with it, I may have reason for thanking you; and, if you will not voluntarily, this lance and sword\ntogether with the might of my arm shall compel you to comply with it by force.\"\n\"Nice nonsense!\" said the commissary; \"a fine piece of pleasantry he has come out with at last! He wants\nus to let the king's prisoners go, as if we had any authority to release them, or he to order us to do so! Go\nyour way, sir, and good luck to you; put that basin straight that you've got on your head, and don't go\nlooking for three feet on a cat.\"\n\"'Tis you that are the cat, rat, and rascal,\" replied Don Quixote, and acting on the word he fell upon him\nso suddenly that without giving him time to defend himself he brought him to the ground sorely wounded\nwith a lance-thrust; and lucky it was for him that it was the one that had the musket. The other guards\nstood thunderstruck and amazed at this unexpected event, but recovering presence of mind, those on\nhorseback seized their swords, and those on foot their javelins, and attacked Don Quixote, who was\nwaiting for them with great calmness; and no doubt it would have gone badly with him if the galley\nslaves, seeing the chance before them of liberating themselves, had not effected it by contriving to break\nthe chain on which they were strung. Such was the confusion, that the guards, now rushing at the galley\nslaves who were breaking loose, now to attack Don Quixote who was waiting for them, did nothing at all\nthat was of any use. Sancho, on his part, gave a helping hand to release Gines de Pasamonte, who was the\nfirst to leap forth upon the plain free and unfettered, and who, attacking the prostrate commissary, took\nfrom him his sword and the musket, with which, aiming at one and levelling at another, he, without ever\ndischarging it, drove every one of the guards off the field, for they took to flight, as well to escape\nPasamonte's musket, as the showers of stones the now released galley slaves were raining upon them.\nSancho was greatly grieved at the affair, because he anticipated that those who had fled would report the\nmatter to the Holy Brotherhood, who at the summons of the alarm-bell would at once sally forth in quest\nof the offenders; and he said so to his master, and entreated him to leave the place at once, and go into\nhiding in the sierra that was close by.\n\"That is all very well,\" said Don Quixote, \"but I know what must be done now;\" and calling together all\nthe galley slaves, who were now running riot, and had stripped the commissary to the skin, he collected\nthem round him to hear what he had to say, and addressed them as follows: \"To be grateful for benefits\nreceived is the part of persons of good birth, and one of the sins most offensive to God is ingratitude; I\nsay so because, sirs, ye have already seen by manifest proof the benefit ye have received of me; in return\n-74\n\nfor which I desire, and it is my good pleasure that, laden with that chain which I have taken off your\nnecks, ye at once set out and proceed to the city of El Toboso, and there present yourselves before the\nlady Dulcinea del Toboso, and say to her that her knight, he of Regretful Appearance, sends to commend\nhimself to her; and that ye recount to her in full detail all the particulars of this notable adventure, up to\nthe recovery of your longed-for liberty; and this done ye may go where ye will, and good fortune attend\nyou.\"\nGines de Pasamonte made answer for all, saying, \"That which you, sir, our deliverer, demand of us, is of\nall impossibilities the most impossible to comply with, because we cannot go together along the roads, but\nonly singly and separate, and each one his own way, endeavouring to hide ourselves in the bowels of the\nearth to escape the Holy Brotherhood, which, no doubt, will come out in search of us. What your worship\nmay do, and fairly do, is to change this service and tribute as regards the lady Dulcinea del Toboso for a\ncertain quantity of ave-marias and credos which we will say for your worship's intention, and this is a\ncondition that can be complied with by night as by day, running or resting, in peace or in war; but to\nimagine that we are going now to return to the flesh-pots of Egypt, I mean to take up our chain and set out\nfor El Toboso, is to imagine that it is now night, though it is not yet ten in the morning, and to ask this of\nus is like asking pears of the elm tree.\"\n\"Then by all that's good,\" said Don Quixote (now stirred to wrath), \"Don son of a bitch, Don Ginesillo de\nParopillo, or whatever your name is, you will have to go yourself alone, with your tail between your legs\nand the whole chain on your back.\"\nPasamonte, who was anything but meek (being by this time thoroughly convinced that Don Quixote was\nnot quite right in his head as he had committed such a vagary as to set them free), finding himself abused\nin this fashion, gave the wink to his companions, and falling back they began to shower stones on Don\nQuixote at such a rate that he was quite unable to protect himself with his buckler, and poor Rocinante no\nmore heeded the spur than if he had been made of brass. Sancho planted himself behind his ass, and with\nhim sheltered himself from the hailstorm that poured on both of them. Don Quixote was unable to shield\nhimself so well but that more pebbles than I could count struck him full on the body with such force that\nthey brought him to the ground; and the instant he fell the student pounced upon him, snatched the basin\nfrom his head, and with it struck three or four blows on his shoulders, and as many more on the ground,\nknocking it almost to pieces. They then stripped him of a jacket that he wore over his armour, and they\nwould have stripped off his stockings if his greaves had not prevented them. From Sancho they took his\ncoat, leaving him in his shirt-sleeves; and dividing among themselves the remaining spoils of the battle,\nthey went each one his own way, more solicitous about keeping clear of the Holy Brotherhood they\ndreaded, than about burdening themselves with the chain, or going to present themselves before the lady\nDulcinea del Toboso. The ass and Rocinante, Sancho and Don Quixote, were all that were left upon the\nspot; the ass with drooping head, serious, shaking his ears from time to time as if he thought the storm of\nstones that assailed them was not yet over; Rocinante stretched beside his master, for he too had been\nbrought to the ground by a stone; Sancho stripped, and trembling with fear of the Holy Brotherhood; and\nDon Quixote fuming to find himself so served by the very persons for whom he had done so much.\nCHAPTER XXIII.\nOF WHAT BEFELL DON QUIXOTE IN THE SIERRA MORENA, WHICH WAS ONE OF THE\nRAREST ADVENTURES RELATED IN THIS VERACIOUS HISTORY\nSeeing himself served in this way, Don Quixote said to his squire, \"I have always heard it said, Sancho,\nthat to do good to boors is to throw water into the sea. If I had believed thy words, I should have avoided\nthis trouble; but it is done now, it is only to have patience and take warning for the future.\"\n-75\n\n\"Your worship will take warning as much as I am a Turk,\" returned Sancho; \"but, as you say this\nmischief might have been avoided if you had believed me, believe me now, and a still greater one will be\navoided; for I tell you chivalry is of no account with the Holy Brotherhood, and they don't care two\nmaravedis for all the knights-errant in the world; and I can tell you I fancy I hear their arrows whistling\npast my ears this minute.\"\n\"Thou art a coward by nature, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"but lest thou shouldst say I am obstinate, and\nthat I never do as thou dost advise, this once I will take thy advice, and withdraw out of reach of that fury\nthou so dreadest; but it must be on one condition, that never, in life or in death, thou art to say to anyone\nthat I retired or withdrew from this danger out of fear, but only in compliance with thy entreaties; for if\nthou sayest otherwise thou wilt lie therein, and from this time to that, and from that to this, I give thee lie,\nand say thou liest and wilt lie every time thou thinkest or sayest it; and answer me not again; for at the\nmere thought that I am withdrawing or retiring from any danger, above all from this, which does seem to\ncarry some little shadow of fear with it, I am ready to take my stand here and await alone, not only that\nHoly Brotherhood you talk of and dread, but the brothers of the twelve tribes of Israel, and the Seven\nMaccabees, and Castor and Pollux, and all the brothers and brotherhoods in the world.\"\n\"Senor,\" replied Sancho, \"to retire is not to flee, and there is no wisdom in waiting when danger\noutweighs hope, and it is the part of wise men to preserve themselves to-day for to-morrow, and not risk\nall in one day; and let me tell you, though I am a clown and a boor, I have got some notion of what they\ncall safe conduct; so repent not of having taken my advice, but mount Rocinante if you can, and if not I\nwill help you; and follow me, for my mother-wit tells me we have more need of legs than hands just\nnow.\"\nDon Quixote mounted without replying, and, Sancho leading the way on his ass, they entered the side of\nthe Sierra Morena, which was close by, as it was Sancho's design to cross it entirely and come out again\nat El Viso or Almodovar del Campo, and hide for some days among its crags so as to escape the search of\nthe Brotherhood should they come to look for them. He was encouraged in this by perceiving that the\nstock of provisions carried by the ass had come safe out of the fray with the galley slaves, a circumstance\nthat he regarded as a miracle, seeing how they pillaged and ransacked.\nThat night they reached the very heart of the Sierra Morena, where it seemed prudent to Sancho to pass\nthe night and even some days, at least as many as the stores he carried might last, and so they encamped\nbetween two rocks and among some cork trees; but fatal destiny, which, according to the opinion of those\nwho have not the light of the true faith, directs, arranges, and settles everything in its own way, so ordered\nit that Gines de Pasamonte, the famous knave and thief who by the virtue and madness of Don Quixote\nhad been released from the chain, driven by fear of the Holy Brotherhood, which he had good reason to\ndread, resolved to take hiding in the mountains; and his fate and fear led him to the same spot to which\nDon Quixote and Sancho Panza had been led by theirs, just in time to recognise them and leave them to\nfall asleep: and as the wicked are always ungrateful, and necessity leads to evildoing, and immediate\nadvantage overcomes all considerations of the future, Gines, who was neither grateful nor well-principled,\nmade up his mind to steal Sancho Panza's ass, not troubling himself about Rocinante, as being a prize that\nwas no good either to pledge or sell. While Sancho slept he stole his ass, and before day dawned he was\nfar out of reach.\nAurora made her appearance bringing gladness to the earth but sadness to Sancho Panza, for he found that\nhis Dapple was missing, and seeing himself bereft of him he began the saddest and most doleful lament in\nthe world, so loud that Don Quixote awoke at his exclamations and heard him saying, \"O son of my\nbowels, born in my very house, my children's plaything, my wife's joy, the envy of my neighbours, relief\nof my burdens, and lastly, half supporter of myself, for with the six-and-twenty maravedis thou didst earn\nme daily I met half my charges.\"\n-76\n\nDon Quixote, when he heard the lament and learned the cause, consoled Sancho with the best arguments\nhe could, entreating him to be patient, and promising to give him a letter of exchange ordering three out\nof five ass-colts that he had at home to be given to him. Sancho took comfort at this, dried his tears,\nsuppressed his sobs, and returned thanks for the kindness shown him by Don Quixote. He on his part was\nrejoiced to the heart on entering the mountains, as they seemed to him to be just the place for the\nadventures he was in quest of. They brought back to his memory the marvellous adventures that had\nbefallen knights-errant in like solitudes and wilds, and he went along reflecting on these things, so\nabsorbed and carried away by them that he had no thought for anything else.\nNor had Sancho any other care (now that he fancied he was travelling in a safe quarter) than to satisfy his\nappetite with such remains as were left of the clerical spoils, and so he marched behind his master laden\nwith what Dapple used to carry, emptying the sack and packing his paunch, and so long as he could go\nthat way, he would not have given a farthing to meet with another adventure.\nWhile so engaged he raised his eyes and saw that his master had halted, and was trying with the point of\nhis pike to lift some bulky object that lay upon the ground, on which he hastened to join him and help him\nif it were needful, and reached him just as with the point of the pike he was raising a saddle-pad with a\nvalise attached to it, half or rather wholly rotten and torn; but so heavy were they that Sancho had to help\nto take them up, and his master directed him to see what the valise contained. Sancho did so with great\nalacrity, and though the valise was secured by a chain and padlock, from its torn and rotten condition he\nwas able to see its contents, which were four shirts of fine holland, and other articles of linen no less\ncurious than clean; and in a handkerchief he found a good lot of gold crowns, and as soon as he saw them\nhe exclaimed:\n\"Blessed be all Heaven for sending us an adventure that is good for something!\"\nSearching further he found a little memorandum book richly bound; this Don Quixote asked of him,\ntelling him to take the money and keep it for himself. Sancho kissed his hands for the favour, and cleared\nthe valise of its linen, which he stowed away in the provision sack. Considering the whole matter, Don\nQuixote observed:\n\"It seems to me, Sancho--and it is impossible it can be otherwise-that some strayed traveller must have\ncrossed this sierra and been attacked and slain by footpads, who brought him to this remote spot to bury\nhim.\"\n\"That cannot be,\" answered Sancho, \"because if they had been robbers they would not have left this\nmoney.\"\n\"Thou art right,\" said Don Quixote, \"and I cannot guess or explain what this may mean; but stay; let us\nsee if in this memorandum book there is anything written by which we may be able to trace out or\ndiscover what we want to know.\" Turning over nearly all the pages of the book he found verses and\nletters, some of which he could read, while others he could not; but they were all made up of complaints,\nlaments, misgivings, desires and aversions, favours and rejections, some rapturous, some doleful. While\nDon Quixote examined the book, Sancho examined the valise, not leaving a corner in the whole of it or in\nthe pad that he did not search, peer into, and explore, or seam that he did not rip, or tuft of wool that he\ndid not pick to pieces, lest anything should escape for want of care and pains; so keen was the\ncovetousness excited in him by the discovery of the crowns, which amounted to near a hundred; and\nthough he found no more booty, he held the blanket flights, balsam vomits, stake benedictions, mule-\ndrivers' fisticuffs, missing saddlebags, stolen coat, and all the hunger, thirst, and weariness he had\nendured in the service of his good master, cheap at the price; as he considered himself more than fully\nindemnified for all by the payment he received in the gift of the treasure-trove.\n-77\n\nThe Knight of Regretful Appearance was still very anxious to find out who the owner of the valise could\nbe, conjecturing from the sonnet and letter, from the money in gold, and from the fineness of the shirts,\nthat he must be some lover of distinction whom the scorn and cruelty of his lady had driven to some\ndesperate course; but as in that uninhabited and rugged spot there was no one to be seen of whom he\ncould inquire, he saw nothing else for it but to push on, taking whatever road Rocinante chose--which was\nwhere he could make his way--firmly persuaded that among these wilds he could not fail to meet some\nrare adventure. As he went along, then, occupied with these thoughts, he perceived on the summit of a\nheight that rose before their eyes a man who went springing from rock to rock and from tussock to\ntussock with marvellous agility. As well as he could make out he was unclad, with a thick black beard,\nlong tangled hair, and bare legs and feet, his thighs were covered by breeches apparently of tawny velvet\nbut so ragged that they showed his skin in several places.\nHe was bareheaded, and notwithstanding the swiftness with which he passed as has been described, the\nKnight of Regretful Appearance observed and noted all these trifles, and though he made the attempt, he\nwas unable to follow him, for it was not granted to the feebleness of Rocinante to make way over such\nrough ground, he being, moreover, slow-paced and sluggish by nature. Don Quixote at once came to the\nconclusion that this was the owner of the saddle-pad and of the valise, and made up his mind to go in\nsearch of him, even though he should have to wander a year in those mountains before he found him, and\nso he directed Sancho to take a short cut over one side of the mountain, while he himself went by the\nother, and perhaps by this means they might light upon this man who had passed so quickly out of their\nsight.\n\"I could not do that,\" said Sancho, \"for when I separate from your worship fear at once lays hold of me,\nand assails me with all sorts of panics and fancies; and let what I now say be a notice that from this time\nforth I am not going to stir a finger's width from your presence.\"\n\"It shall be so,\" said he of Regretful Appearance, \"and I am very glad that thou art willing to rely on my\ncourage, which will never fail thee, even though the soul in thy body fail thee; so come on now behind me\nslowly as well as thou canst, and make lanterns of thine eyes; let us make the circuit of this ridge; perhaps\nwe shall light upon this man that we saw, who no doubt is no other than the owner of what we found.\"\nTo which Sancho made answer, \"Far better would it be not to look for him, for, if we find him, and he\nhappens to be the owner of the money, it is plain I must restore it; it would be better, therefore, that\nwithout taking this needless trouble, I should keep possession of it until in some other less meddlesome\nand officious way the real owner may be discovered; and perhaps that will be when I shall have spent it,\nand then the king will hold me harmless.\"\n\"Thou art wrong there, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"for now that we have a suspicion who the owner is,\nand have him almost before us, we are bound to seek him and make restitution; and if we do not see him,\nthe strong suspicion we have as to his being the owner makes us as guilty as if he were so; and so, friend\nSancho, let not our search for him give thee any uneasiness, for if we find him it will relieve mine.\"\nAnd so saying he gave Rocinante the spur, and Sancho followed him on foot and loaded, and after having\npartly made the circuit of the mountain they found lying in a ravine, dead and half devoured by dogs and\npecked by jackdaws, a mule saddled and bridled, all which still further strengthened their suspicion that\nhe who had fled was the owner of the mule and the saddle-pad.\nAs they stood looking at it they heard a whistle like that of a shepherd watching his flock, and suddenly\non their left there appeared a great number of goats and behind them on the summit of the mountain the\ngoatherd in charge of them, a man advanced in years. Don Quixote called aloud to him and begged him to\ncome down to where they stood. He shouted in return, asking what had brought them to that spot, seldom\n-78\n\nor never trodden except by the feet of goats, or of the wolves and other wild beasts that roamed around.\nSancho in return bade him come down, and they would explain all to him.\nThe goatherd descended, and reaching the place where Don Quixote stood, he said, \"I will wager you are\nlooking at that hack mule that lies dead in the hollow there, and, faith, it has been lying there now these\nsix months; tell me, have you come upon its master about here?\"\n\"We have come upon nobody,\" answered Don Quixote, \"nor on anything except a saddle-pad and a little\nvalise that we found not far from this.\"\n\"I found it too,\" said the goatherd, \"but I would not lift it nor go near it for fear of some ill-luck or being\ncharged with theft, for the devil is crafty, and things rise up under one's feet to make one fall without\nknowing why or wherefore.\"\n\"That's exactly what I say,\" said Sancho; \"I found it too, and I would not go within a stone's throw of it;\nthere I left it, and there it lies just as it was, for I don't want a dog with a bell.\"\n\"Tell me, good man,\" said Don Quixote, \"do you know who is the owner of this property?\"\n\"All I can tell you,\" said the goatherd, \"is that about six months ago, more or less, there arrived at a\nshepherd's hut three leagues, perhaps, away from this, a youth of well-bred appearance and manners,\nmounted on that same mule which lies dead here, and with the same saddle-pad and valise which you say\nyou found and did not touch. He asked us what part of this sierra was the most rugged and retired; we told\nhim that it was where we now are; and so in truth it is, for if you push on half a league farther, perhaps\nyou will not be able to find your way out; and I am wondering how you have managed to come here, for\nthere is no road or path that leads to this spot. I say, then, that on hearing our answer the youth turned\nabout and made for the place we pointed out to him, leaving us all charmed with his good looks, and\nwondering at his question and the haste with which we saw him depart in the direction of the sierra; and\nafter that we saw him no more, until some days afterwards he crossed the path of one of our shepherds,\nand without saying a word to him, came up to him and gave him several cuffs and kicks, and then turned\nto the ass with our provisions and took all the bread and cheese it carried, and having done this made off\nback again into the sierra with extraordinary swiftness. When some of us goatherds learned this we went\nin search of him for about two days through the most remote portion of this sierra, at the end of which we\nfound him lodged in the hollow of a large thick cork tree. He came out to meet us with great gentleness,\nwith his dress now torn and his face so disfigured and burned by the sun, that we hardly recognised him\nbut that his clothes, though torn, convinced us, from the recollection we had of them, that he was the\nperson we were looking for. He saluted us courteously, and in a few well-spoken words he told us not to\nwonder at seeing him going about in this guise, as it was binding upon him in order that he might work\nout a penance which for his many sins had been imposed upon him. We asked him to tell us who he was,\nbut we were never able to find out from him: we begged of him too, when he was in want of food, which\nhe could not do without, to tell us where we should find him, as we would bring it to him with all\ngood-will and readiness; or if this were not to his taste, at least to come and ask it of us and not take it by\nforce from the shepherds. He thanked us for the offer, begged pardon for the late assault, and promised\nfor the future to ask it in God's name without offering violence to anybody. As for fixed abode, he said he\nhad no other than that which chance offered wherever night might overtake him; and his words ended in\nan outburst of weeping so bitter that we who listened to him must have been very stones had we not\njoined him in it, comparing what we saw of him the first time with what we saw now; for, as I said, he\nwas a graceful and gracious youth, and in his courteous and polished language showed himself to be of\ngood birth and courtly breeding, and rustics as we were that listened to him, even to us his gentle bearing\nsufficed to make it plain.\n-79\n\n\"But in the midst of his conversation he stopped and became silent, keeping his eyes fixed upon the\nground for some time, during which we stood still waiting anxiously to see what would come of this\nabstraction; and with no little pity, for from his behaviour, now staring at the ground with fixed gaze and\neyes wide open without moving an eyelid, again closing them, compressing his lips and raising his\neyebrows, we could perceive plainly that a fit of madness of some kind had come upon him; and before\nlong he showed that what we imagined was the truth, for he arose in a fury from the ground where he had\nthrown himself, and attacked the first he found near him with such rage and fierceness that if we had not\ndragged him off him, he would have beaten or bitten him to death, all the while exclaiming, 'Oh faithless\nFernando, here, here shalt thou pay the penalty of the wrong thou hast done me; these hands shall tear out\nthat heart of thine, abode and dwelling of all iniquity, but of deceit and fraud above all; and to these he\nadded other words all in effect upbraiding this Fernando and charging him with treachery and\nfaithlessness.\n\"We forced him to release his hold with no little difficulty, and without another word he left us, and\nrushing off plunged in among these brakes and brambles, so as to make it impossible for us to follow him;\nfrom this we suppose that madness comes upon him from time to time, and that some one called Fernando\nmust have done him a wrong of a grievous nature such as the condition to which it had brought him\nseemed to show. And to tell you the truth, sirs,\" continued the goatherd, \"it was yesterday that we\nresolved, I and four of the lads, two of them our servants, and the other two friends of mine, to go in\nsearch of him until we find him, and when we do to take him, whether by force or of his own consent, to\nthe town of Almodovar, which is eight leagues from this, and there strive to cure him (if indeed his\nmalady admits of a cure), or learn when he is in his senses who he is, and if he has relatives to whom we\nmay give notice of his misfortune. This, sirs, is all I can say in answer to what you have asked me; and be\nsure that the owner of the articles you found is he whom you saw pass by with such nimbleness and so\nnaked.\"\nFor Don Quixote had already described how he had seen the man go bounding along the mountain side,\nand he was now filled with amazement at what he heard from the goatherd, and more eager than ever to\ndiscover who the unhappy madman was; and in his heart he resolved, as he had done before, to search for\nhim all over the mountain, not leaving a corner or cave unexamined until he had found him. But chance\narranged matters better than he expected or hoped, for at that very moment, in a gorge on the mountain\nthat opened where they stood, the youth he wished to find made his appearance, coming along talking to\nhimself in a way that would have been unintelligible near at hand, much more at a distance. His garb was\nwhat has been described, save that as he drew near, Don Quixote perceived that a tattered doublet which\nhe wore was amber-tanned, from which he concluded that one who wore such garments could not be of\nvery low rank.\nApproaching them, the youth greeted them in a harsh and hoarse voice but with great courtesy. Don\nQuixote returned his salutation with equal politeness, and dismounting from Rocinante advanced with\nwell-bred bearing and grace to embrace him, and held him for some time close in his arms as if he had\nknown him for a long time. The other, whom we may call the Ragged One of the Sorry Countenance, as\nDon Quixote was of the Regretful Appearance, after submitting to the embrace pushed him back a little\nand, placing his hands on Don Quixote's shoulders, stood gazing at him as if seeking to see whether he\nknew him, not less amazed, perhaps, at the sight of the face, figure, and armour of Don Quixote than Don\nQuixote was at the sight of him. To be brief, the first to speak after embracing was the Ragged One, and\nhe said what will be told farther on.\nCHAPTER XXIV.\nIN WHICH IS CONTINUED THE ADVENTURE OF THE SIERRA MORENA\n-80\n\nThe history relates that it was with the greatest attention Don Quixote listened to the ragged knight of the\nSierra, who began by saying:\n\"Of a surety, senor, whoever you are, for I know you not, I thank you for the proofs of kindness and\ncourtesy you have shown me, and would I were in a condition to requite with something more than\ngood-will that which you have displayed towards me in the cordial reception you have given me; but my\nfate does not afford me any other means of returning kindnesses done me save the hearty desire to repay\nthem.\"\n\"Mine,\" replied Don Quixote, \"is to be of service to you, and I conjure you by whatever you love or have\nloved best in life, to tell me who you are and the cause that has brought you to live or die in these\nsolitudes like a brute beast, dwelling among them in a manner so foreign to your condition as your garb\nand appearance show. And I swear,\" added Don Quixote, \"by the order of knighthood which I have\nreceived, and by my vocation of knight-errant, if you gratify me in this, to serve you with all the zeal my\ncalling demands of me, either in relieving your misfortune if it admits of relief, or in joining you in\nlamenting it as I promised to do.\" The Knight of the Thicket, hearing him of Regretful Appearance talk in\nthis strain, did nothing but stare at him, and stare at him again, and again survey him from head to foot;\nand when he had thoroughly examined him, he said to him: \"If you have anything to give me to eat, for\nGod's sake give it me, and after I have eaten I will do all you ask in acknowledgment of the goodwill you\nhave displayed towards me.\"\nSancho from his sack, and the goatherd from his pouch, furnished the Ragged One with the means of\nappeasing his hunger, and what they gave him he ate like a half-witted being, so hastily that he took no\ntime between mouthfuls, gorging rather than swallowing; and while he ate neither he nor they who\nobserved him uttered a word. As soon as he had done he made signs to them to follow him, which they\ndid, and he led them to a green plot which lay a little farther off round the corner of a rock. On reaching it\nhe stretched himself upon the grass, and the others did the same, all keeping silence, until the Ragged\nOne, settling himself in his place, said:\n\"If it is your wish, sirs, that I should disclose in a few words the surpassing extent of my misfortunes, you\nmust promise not to break the thread of my sad story with any question or other interruption, for the\ninstant you do so the tale I tell will come to an end.\" These words of the Ragged One reminded Don\nQuixote of the tale his squire had told him, when he failed to keep count of the goats that had crossed the\nriver and the story remained unfinished; but to return to the Ragged One, he went on to say: \"I give you\nthis warning because I wish to pass briefly over the story of my misfortunes, for recalling them to\nmemory only serves to add fresh ones, and the less you question me the sooner shall I make an end of the\nrecital, though I shall not omit to relate anything of importance in order fully to satisfy your curiosity.\"\nDon Quixote gave the promise for himself and the others, and with this assurance he began as follows:\n\"My name is Cardenio, my birthplace one of the best cities of this Andalusia, my family noble, my\nparents rich, my misfortune so great that my parents must have wept and my family grieved over it\nwithout being able by their wealth to lighten it; for the gifts of fortune can do little to relieve reverses sent\nby Heaven. In that same country there was a heaven in which love had placed all the glory I could desire;\nsuch was the beauty of Luscinda, a damsel as noble and as rich as I, but of happier fortunes, and of less\nfirmness than was due to so worthy a passion as mine. This Luscinda I loved, worshipped, and adored\nfrom my earliest and tenderest years, and she loved me in all the innocence and sincerity of childhood.\nOur parents were aware of our feelings, and were not sorry to perceive them, for they saw clearly that as\nthey ripened they must lead at last to a marriage between us, a thing that seemed almost prearranged by\nthe equality of our families and wealth. We grew up, and with our growth grew the love between us, so\nthat the father of Luscinda felt bound for propriety's sake to refuse me admission to his house, in this\nperhaps imitating the parents of that Thisbe so celebrated by the poets, and this refusal but added love to\n-81\n\nlove and flame to flame; for though they enforced silence upon our tongues they could not impose it upon\nour pens, which can make known the heart's secrets to a loved one more freely than tongues; for many a\ntime the presence of the object of love shakes the firmest will and strikes dumb the boldest tongue. Ah\nheavens! how many letters did I write her, and how many dainty modest replies did I receive! how many\nditties and love-songs did I compose in which my heart declared and made known its feelings, described\nits ardent longings, revelled in its recollections and dallied with its desires! At length growing impatient\nand feeling my heart languishing with longing to see her, I resolved to put into execution and carry out\nwhat seemed to me the best mode of winning my desired and merited reward, to ask her of her father for\nmy lawful wife, which I did. To this his answer was that he thanked me for the disposition I showed to do\nhonour to him and to regard myself as honoured by the bestowal of his treasure; but that as my father was\nalive it was his by right to make this demand, for if it were not in accordance with his full will and\npleasure, Luscinda was not to be taken or given by stealth.\n\"I thanked him for his kindness, reflecting that there was reason in what he said, and that my father would\nassent to it as soon as I should tell him, and with that view I went the very same instant to let him know\nwhat my desires were. When I entered the room where he was I found him with an open letter in his hand,\nwhich, before I could utter a word, he gave me, saying, 'By this letter thou wilt see, Cardenio, the\ndisposition the Duke Ricardo has to serve thee.' This Duke Ricardo, as you, sirs, probably know already,\nis a grandee of Spain who has his seat in the best part of this Andalusia. I took and read the letter, which\nwas couched in terms so flattering that even I myself felt it would be wrong in my father not to comply\nwith the request the duke made in it, which was that he would send me immediately to him, as he wished\nme to become the companion, not servant, of his eldest son, and would take upon himself the charge of\nplacing me in a position corresponding to the esteem in which he held me. On reading the letter my voice\nfailed me, and still more when I heard my father say, 'Two days hence thou wilt depart, Cardenio, in\naccordance with the duke's wish, and give thanks to God who is opening a road to thee by which thou\nmayest attain what I know thou dost deserve; and to these words he added others of fatherly counsel. The\ntime for my departure arrived; I spoke one night to Luscinda, I told her all that had occurred, as I did also\nto her father, entreating him to allow some delay, and to defer the disposal of her hand until I should see\nwhat the Duke Ricardo sought of me: he gave me the promise, and she confirmed it with vows and\nswoonings unnumbered. Finally, I presented myself to the duke, and was received and treated by him so\nkindly that very soon envy began to do its work, the old servants growing envious of me, and regarding\nthe duke's inclination to show me favour as an injury to themselves. But the one to whom my arrival gave\nthe greatest pleasure was the duke's second son, Fernando by name, a gallant youth, of noble, generous,\nand amorous disposition, who very soon made so intimate a friend of me that it was remarked by\neverybody; for though the elder was attached to me, and showed me kindness, he did not carry his\naffectionate treatment to the same length as Don Fernando. It so happened, then, that as between friends\nno secret remains unshared, and as the favour I enjoyed with Don Fernando had grown into friendship, he\nmade all his thoughts known to me, and in particular a love affair which troubled his mind a little. He was\ndeeply in love with a peasant girl, a vassal of his father's, the daughter of wealthy parents, and herself so\nbeautiful, modest, discreet, and virtuous, that no one who knew her was able to decide in which of these\nrespects she was most highly gifted or most excelled. The attractions of the fair peasant raised the passion\nof Don Fernando to such a point that, in order to gain his object and overcome her virtuous resolutions, he\ndetermined to pledge his word to her to become her husband, for to attempt it in any other way was to\nattempt an impossibility. Bound to him as I was by friendship, I strove by the best arguments and the\nmost forcible examples I could think of to restrain and dissuade him from such a course; but perceiving I\nproduced no effect I resolved to make the Duke Ricardo, his father, acquainted with the matter; but Don\nFernando, being sharp-witted and shrewd, foresaw and apprehended this, perceiving that by my duty as a\ngood servant I was bound not to keep concealed a thing so much opposed to the honour of my lord the\nduke; and so, to mislead and deceive me, he told me he could find no better way of effacing from his\nmind the beauty that so enslaved him than by absenting himself for some months, and that he wished the\nabsence to be effected by our going, both of us, to my father's house under the pretence, which he would\n-82\n\nmake to the duke, of going to see and buy some fine horses that there were in my city, which produces the\nbest in the world. When I heard him say so, even if his resolution had not been so good a one I should\nhave hailed it as one of the happiest that could be imagined, prompted by my affection, seeing what a\nfavourable chance and opportunity it offered me of returning to see my Luscinda. With this thought and\nwish I commended his idea and encouraged his design, advising him to put it into execution as quickly as\npossible, as, in truth, absence produced its effect in spite of the most deeply rooted feelings. But, as\nafterwards appeared, when he said this to me he had already enjoyed the peasant girl under the title of\nhusband, and was waiting for an opportunity of making it known with safety to himself, being in dread of\nwhat his father the duke would do when he came to know of his folly. It happened, then, that as with\nyoung men love is for the most part nothing more than appetite, which, as its final object is enjoyment,\ncomes to an end on obtaining it, and that which seemed to be love takes to flight, as it cannot pass the\nlimit fixed by nature, which fixes no limit to true love--what I mean is that after Don Fernando had\nenjoyed this peasant girl his passion subsided and his eagerness cooled, and if at first he feigned a wish to\nabsent himself in order to cure his love, he was now in reality anxious to go to avoid keeping his promise.\n\"The duke gave him permission, and ordered me to accompany him; we arrived at my city, and my father\ngave him the reception due to his rank; I saw Luscinda without delay, and, though it had not been dead or\ndeadened, my love gathered fresh life. To my sorrow I told the story of it to Don Fernando, for I thought\nthat in virtue of the great friendship he bore me I was bound to conceal nothing from him. I extolled her\nbeauty, her gaiety, her wit, so warmly, that my praises excited in him a desire to see a damsel adorned by\nsuch attractions. To my misfortune I yielded to it, showing her to him one night by the light of a taper at a\nwindow where we used to talk to one another. As she appeared to him in her dressing-gown, she drove all\nthe beauties he had seen until then out of his recollection; speech failed him, his head turned, he was\nspell-bound, and in the end love-smitten, as you will see in the course of the story of my misfortune; and\nto inflame still further his passion, which he hid from me and revealed to Heaven alone, it so happened\nthat one day he found a note of hers entreating me to demand her of her father in marriage, so delicate, so\nmodest, and so tender, that on reading it he told me that in Luscinda alone were combined all the charms\nof beauty and understanding that were distributed among all the other women in the world. It is true, and I\nown it now, that though I knew what good cause Don Fernando had to praise Luscinda, it gave me\nuneasiness to hear these praises from his mouth, and I began to fear, and with reason to feel distrust of\nhim, for there was no moment when he was not ready to talk of Luscinda, and he would start the subject\nhimself even though he dragged it in unseasonably, a circumstance that aroused in me a certain amount of\njealousy; not that I feared any change in the constancy or faith of Luscinda; but still my fate led me to\nforebode what she assured me against. Don Fernando contrived always to read the letters I sent to\nLuscinda and her answers to me, under the pretence that he enjoyed the wit and sense of both. It so\nhappened, then, that Luscinda having begged of me a book of chivalry to read, one that she was very fond\nof, Amadis of Gaul-\"\nDon Quixote no sooner heard a book of chivalry mentioned, than he said:\n\"Had your worship told me at the beginning of your story that the Lady Luscinda was fond of books of\nchivalry, no other laudation would have been requisite to impress upon me the superiority of her\nunderstanding, for it could not have been of the excellence you describe had a taste for such delightful\nreading been wanting; so, as far as I am concerned, you need waste no more words in describing her\nbeauty, worth, and intelligence; for, on merely hearing what her taste was, I declare her to be the most\nbeautiful and the most intelligent woman in the world; and I wish your worship had, along with Amadis\nof Gaul, sent her the worthy Don Rugel of Greece, for I know the Lady Luscinda would greatly relish\nDaraida and Garaya, and the shrewd sayings of the shepherd Darinel, and the admirable verses of his\nbucolics, sung and delivered by him with such sprightliness, wit, and ease; but a time may come when\nthis omission can be remedied, and to rectify it nothing more is needed than for your worship to be so\ngood as to come with me to my village, for there I can give you more than three hundred books which are\n-83\n\nthe delight of my soul and the entertainment of my life;--though it occurs to me that I have not got one of\nthem now, thanks to the spite of wicked and envious enchanters;--but pardon me for having broken the\npromise we made not to interrupt your discourse; for when I hear chivalry or knights-errant mentioned, I\ncan no more help talking about them than the rays of the sun can help giving heat, or those of the moon\nmoisture; pardon me, therefore, and proceed, for that is more to the purpose now.\"\nWhile Don Quixote was saying this, Cardenio allowed his head to fall upon his breast, and seemed\nplunged in deep thought; and though twice Don Quixote bade him go on with his story, he neither looked\nup nor uttered a word in reply; but after some time he raised his head and said, \"I cannot get rid of the\nidea, nor will anyone in the world remove it, or make me think otherwise--and he would be a blockhead\nwho would hold or believe anything else than that that arrant knave Master Elisabad made free with\nQueen Madasima.\"\n\"That is not true, by all that's good,\" said Don Quixote in high wrath, turning upon him angrily, as his\nway was; \"and it is a very great slander, or rather villainy. Queen Madasima was a very illustrious lady,\nand it is not to be supposed that so exalted a princess would have made free with a quack; and whoever\nmaintains the contrary lies like a great scoundrel, and I will give him to know it, on foot or on horseback,\narmed or unarmed, by night or by day, or as he likes best.\"\nCardenio was looking at him steadily, and his mad fit having now come upon him, he had no disposition\nto go on with his story, nor would Don Quixote have listened to it, so much had what he had heard about\nMadasima disgusted him. Strange to say, he stood up for her as if she were in earnest his veritable born\nlady; to such a pass had his unholy books brought him. Cardenio, then, being, as I said, now mad, when\nhe heard himself given the lie, and called a scoundrel and other insulting names, not relishing the jest,\nsnatched up a stone that he found near him, and with it delivered such a blow on Don Quixote's breast\nthat he laid him on his back. Sancho Panza, seeing his master treated in this fashion, attacked the madman\nwith his closed fist; but the Ragged One received him in such a way that with a blow of his fist he\nstretched him at his feet, and then mounting upon him crushed his ribs to his own satisfaction; the\ngoatherd, who came to the rescue, shared the same fate; and having beaten and pummelled them all he left\nthem and quietly withdrew to his hiding-place on the mountain. Sancho rose, and with the rage he felt at\nfinding himself so belaboured without deserving it, ran to take vengeance on the goatherd, accusing him\nof not giving them warning that this man was at times taken with a mad fit, for if they had known it they\nwould have been on their guard to protect themselves.\nThe goatherd replied that he had said so, and that if he had not heard him, that was no fault of his. Sancho\nretorted, and the goatherd rejoined, and the altercation ended in their seizing each other by the beard, and\nexchanging such fisticuffs that if Don Quixote had not made peace between them, they would have\nknocked one another to pieces. \"Leave me alone, Sir Knight of Regretful Appearance,\" said Sancho,\ngrappling with the goatherd, \"for of this fellow, who is a clown like myself, and no dubbed knight, I can\nsafely take satisfaction for the affront he has offered me, fighting with him hand to hand like an honest\nman.\"\n\"That is true,\" said Don Quixote, \"but I know that he is not to blame for what has happened.\" With this he\npacified them, and again asked the goatherd if it would be possible to find Cardenio, as he felt the greatest\nanxiety to know the end of his story. The goatherd told him, as he had told him before, that there was no\nknowing of a certainty where his lair was; but that if he wandered about much in that neighbourhood he\ncould not fail to fall in with him either in or out of his senses.\nCHAPTER XXV.\nWHICH TREATS OF THE STRANGE THINGS THAT HAPPENED TO THE STOUT KNIGHT OF\n-84\n\nLA MANCHA IN THE SIERRA MORENA, AND OF HIS IMITATION OF THE PENANCE OF\nBELTENEBROS\nDon Quixote took leave of the goatherd, and once more mounting Rocinante bade Sancho follow him,\nwhich he having no ass, did very discontentedly. They proceeded slowly, making their way into the most\nrugged part of the mountain, Sancho all the while dying to have a talk with his master, and longing for\nhim to begin, so that there should be no breach of the injunction laid upon him; but unable to keep silence\nso long he said to him:\n\"Senor Don Quixote, give me your worship's blessing and dismissal, for I'd like to go home at once to\nmy wife and children with whom I can at any rate talk and converse as much as I like; for to want me to\ngo through these solitudes day and night and not speak to you when I have a mind is burying me alive. If\nluck would have it that animals spoke as they did in the days of Guisopete, it would not be so bad,\nbecause I could talk to Rocinante about whatever came into my head, and so put up with my ill-fortune;\nbut it is a hard case, and not to be borne with patience, to go seeking adventures all one's life and get\nnothing but kicks and blanketings, brickbats and punches, and with all this to have to sew up one's mouth\nwithout daring to say what is in one's heart, just as if one were dumb.\"\n\"I understand thee, Sancho,\" replied Don Quixote; \"thou art dying to have the interdict I placed upon thy\ntongue removed; consider it removed, and say what thou wilt while we are wandering in these\nmountains.\"\n\"So be it,\" said Sancho; \"let me speak now, for God knows what will happen by-and-by; and to take\nadvantage of the permit at once, I ask, what made your worship stand up so for that Queen Majimasa, or\nwhatever her name is, or what did it matter whether that abbot was a friend of hers or not? for if your\nworship had let that pass--and you were not a judge in the matter--it is my belief the madman would have\ngone on with his story, and the blow of the stone, and the kicks, and more than half a dozen cuffs would\nhave been escaped.\"\n\"In faith, Sancho,\" answered Don Quixote, \"if thou knewest as I do what an honourable and illustrious\nlady Queen Madasima was, I know thou wouldst say I had great patience that I did not break in pieces the\nmouth that uttered such blasphemies, for a very great blasphemy it is to say or imagine that a queen has\nmade free with a surgeon. The truth of the story is that that Master Elisabad whom the madman\nmentioned was a man of great prudence and sound judgment, and served as governor and physician to the\nqueen, but to suppose that she was his mistress is nonsense deserving very severe punishment; and as a\nproof that Cardenio did not know what he was saying, remember when he said it he was out of his wits.\"\n\"That is what I say,\" said Sancho; \"there was no occasion for minding the words of a madman; for if good\nluck had not helped your worship, and he had sent that stone at your head instead of at your breast, a fine\nway we should have been in for standing up for my lady yonder, God confound her! And then, would not\nCardenio have gone free as a madman?\"\n\"Against men in their senses or against madmen,\" said Don Quixote, \"every knight-errant is bound to\nstand up for the honour of women, whoever they may be, much more for queens of such high degree and\ndignity as Queen Madasima, for whom I have a particular regard on account of her amiable qualities; for,\nbesides being extremely beautiful, she was very wise, and very patient under her misfortunes, of which\nshe had many; and the counsel and society of the Master Elisabad were a great help and support to her in\nenduring her afflictions with wisdom and resignation; hence the ignorant and ill-disposed vulgar took\noccasion to say and think that she was his mistress; and they lie, I say it once more, and will lie two\nhundred times more, all who think and say so.\"\n-85\n\n\"I neither say nor think so,\" said Sancho; \"let them look to it; with their bread let them eat it; they have\nrendered account to God whether they misbehaved or not; I come from my vineyard, I know nothing; I\nam not fond of prying into other men's lives; he who buys and lies feels it in his purse; moreover, naked\nwas I born, naked I find myself, I neither lose nor gain; but if they did, what is that to me? many think\nthere are flitches where there are no hooks; but who can put gates to the open plain? moreover they said\nof God-\"\n\"God bless me,\" said Don Quixote, \"what a set of absurdities thou art stringing together! What has what\nwe are talking about got to do with the proverbs thou art threading one after the other? for God's sake\nhold thy tongue, Sancho, and henceforward keep to prodding thy ass and don't meddle in what does not\nconcern thee; and understand with all thy five senses that everything I have done, am doing, or shall do, is\nwell founded on reason and in conformity with the rules of chivalry, for I understand them better than all\nthe world that profess them.\"\n\"Senor,\" replied Sancho, \"is it a good rule of chivalry that we should go astray through these mountains\nwithout path or road, looking for a madman who when he is found will perhaps take a fancy to finish\nwhat he began, not his story, but your worship's head and my ribs, and end by breaking them altogether\nfor us?\"\n\"Peace, I say again, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"for let me tell thee it is not so much the desire of finding\nthat madman that leads me into these regions as that which I have of performing among them an\nachievement wherewith I shall win eternal name and fame throughout the known world; and it shall be\nsuch that I shall thereby set the seal on all that can make a knight-errant perfect and famous.\"\n\"And is it very perilous, this achievement?\"\n\"No,\" replied he of Regretful Appearance; \"though it may be in the dice that we may throw deuce-ace\ninstead of sixes; but all will depend on thy diligence.\"\n\"On my diligence!\" said Sancho.\n\"Yes,\" said Don Quixote, \"for if thou dost return soon from the place where I mean to send thee, my\npenance will be soon over, and my glory will soon begin. But as it is not right to keep thee any longer in\nsuspense, waiting to see what comes of my words, I would have thee know, Sancho, that the famous\nAmadis of Gaul was one of the most perfect knights-errant--I am wrong to say he was one; he stood\nalone, the first, the only one, the lord of all that were in the world in his time. A fig for Don Belianis, and\nfor all who say he equalled him in any respect, for, my oath upon it, they are deceiving themselves! I say,\ntoo, that when a painter desires to become famous in his art he endeavours to copy the originals of the\nrarest painters that he knows; and the same rule holds good for all the most important crafts and callings\nthat serve to adorn a state; thus must he who would be esteemed prudent and patient imitate Ulysses, in\nwhose person and labours Homer presents to us a lively picture of prudence and patience; as Virgil, too,\nshows us in the person of AEneas the virtue of a pious son and the sagacity of a brave and skilful captain;\nnot representing or describing them as they were, but as they ought to be, so as to leave the example of\ntheir virtues to posterity. In the same way Amadis was the polestar, day-star, sun of valiant and devoted\nknights, whom all we who fight under the banner of love and chivalry are bound to imitate. This, then,\nbeing so, I consider, friend Sancho, that the knight-errant who shall imitate him most closely will come\nnearest to reaching the perfection of chivalry. Now one of the instances in which this knight most\nconspicuously showed his prudence, worth, valour, endurance, fortitude, and love, was when he\nwithdrew, rejected by the Lady Oriana, to do penance upon the Pena Pobre, changing his name into that\nof Beltenebros, a name assuredly significant and appropriate to the life which he had voluntarily adopted.\nSo, as it is easier for me to imitate him in this than in cleaving giants asunder, cutting off serpents' heads,\n-86\n\nslaying dragons, routing armies, destroying fleets, and breaking enchantments, and as this place is so well\nsuited for a similar purpose, I must not allow the opportunity to escape which now so conveniently offers\nme its forelock.\"\n\"What is it in reality,\" said Sancho, \"that your worship means to do in such an out-of-the-way place as\nthis?\"\n\"Have I not told thee,\" answered Don Quixote, \"that I mean to imitate Amadis here, playing the victim of\ndespair, the madman, the maniac, so as at the same time to imitate the valiant Don Roland, when at the\nfountain he had evidence of the fair Angelica having disgraced herself with Medoro and through grief\nthereat went mad, and plucked up trees, troubled the waters of the clear springs, slew destroyed flocks,\nburned down huts, levelled houses, dragged mares after him, and perpetrated a hundred thousand other\noutrages worthy of everlasting renown and record? And though I have no intention of imitating Roland,\nor Orlando, or Rotolando (for he went by all these names), step by step in all the mad things he did, said,\nand thought, I will make a rough copy to the best of my power of all that seems to me most essential; but\nperhaps I shall content myself with the simple imitation of Amadis, who without giving way to any\nmischievous madness but merely to tears and sorrow, gained as much fame as the most famous.\"\n\"It seems to me,\" said Sancho, \"that the knights who behaved in this way had provocation and cause for\nthose follies and penances; but what cause has your worship for going mad? What lady has rejected you,\nor what evidence have you found to prove that the lady Dulcinea del Toboso has been trifling with Moor\nor Christian?\"\n\"There is the point,\" replied Don Quixote, \"and that is the beauty of this business of mine; no thanks to a\nknight-errant for going mad when he has cause; the thing is to turn crazy without any provocation, and let\nmy lady know, if I do this in the dry, what I would do in the moist; moreover I have abundant cause in the\nlong separation I have endured from my lady till death, Dulcinea del Toboso; for as thou didst hear that\nshepherd Ambrosio say the other day, in absence all ills are felt and feared; and so, friend Sancho, waste\nno time in advising me against so rare, so happy, and so unheard-of an imitation; mad I am, and mad I\nmust be until thou returnest with the answer to a letter that I mean to send by thee to my lady Dulcinea;\nand if it be such as my constancy deserves, my insanity and penance will come to an end; and if it be to\nthe opposite effect, I shall become mad in earnest, and, being so, I shall suffer no more; thus in whatever\nway she may answer I shall escape from the struggle and affliction in which thou wilt leave me, enjoying\nin my senses the boon thou bearest me, or as a madman not feeling the evil thou bringest me. But tell me,\nSancho, hast thou got Mambrino's helmet safe? for I saw thee take it up from the ground when that\nungrateful wretch tried to break it in pieces but could not, by which the fineness of its temper may be\nseen.\"\nTo which Sancho made answer, \"By the living God, Sir Knight of Regretful Appearance, I cannot endure\nor bear with patience some of the things that your worship says; and from them I begin to suspect that all\nyou tell me about chivalry, and winning kingdoms and empires, and giving islands, and bestowing other\nrewards and dignities after the custom of knights-errant, must be all made up of wind and lies, and all\npigments or figments, or whatever we may call them; for what would anyone think that heard your\nworship calling a barber's basin Mambrino's helmet without ever seeing the mistake all this time, but that\none who says and maintains such things must have his brains addled? I have the basin in my sack all\ndinted, and I am taking it home to have it mended, to trim my beard in it, if, by God's grace, I am allowed\nto see my wife and children some day or other.\"\n\"Look here, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"by him thou didst swear by just now I swear thou hast the most\nlimited understanding that any squire in the world has or ever had. Is it possible that all this time thou hast\nbeen going about with me thou hast never found out that all things belonging to knights-errant seem to be\n-87\n\nillusions and nonsense and ravings, and to go always by contraries? And not because it really is so, but\nbecause there is always a swarm of enchanters in attendance upon us that change and alter everything\nwith us, and turn things as they please, and according as they are disposed to aid or destroy us; thus what\nseems to thee a barber's basin seems to me Mambrino's helmet, and to another it will seem something\nelse; and rare foresight it was in the sage who is on my side to make what is really and truly Mambrine's\nhelmet seem a basin to everybody, for, being held in such estimation as it is, all the world would pursue\nme to rob me of it; but when they see it is only a barber's basin they do not take the trouble to obtain it; as\nwas plainly shown by him who tried to break it, and left it on the ground without taking it, for, by my\nfaith, had he known it he would never have left it behind. Keep it safe, my friend, for just now I have no\nneed of it; indeed, I shall have to take off all this armour and remain as naked as I was born, if I have a\nmind to follow Roland rather than Amadis in my penance.\"\nThus talking they reached the foot of a high mountain which stood like an isolated peak among the others\nthat surrounded it. Past its base there flowed a gentle brook, all around it spread a meadow so green and\nluxuriant that it was a delight to the eyes to look upon it, and forest trees in abundance, and shrubs and\nflowers, added to the charms of the spot. Upon this place the Knight of Regretful Appearance fixed his\nchoice for the performance of his penance, and as he beheld it exclaimed in a loud voice as though he\nwere out of his senses:\n\"This is the place, oh, ye heavens, that I select and choose for bewailing the misfortune in which ye\nyourselves have plunged me: this is the spot where the overflowings of mine eyes shall swell the waters\nof yon little brook, and my deep and endless sighs shall stir unceasingly the leaves of these mountain\ntrees, in testimony and token of the pain my persecuted heart is suffering. Oh, ye rural deities, whoever ye\nbe that haunt this lone spot, give ear to the complaint of a wretched lover whom long absence and\nbrooding jealousy have driven to bewail his fate among these wilds and complain of the hard heart of that\nfair and ungrateful one, the end and limit of all human beauty! Oh, ye wood nymphs and dryads, that\ndwell in the thickets of the forest, so may the nimble wanton satyrs by whom ye are vainly wooed never\ndisturb your sweet repose, help me to lament my hard fate or at least weary not at listening to it! Oh,\nDulcinea del Toboso, day of my night, glory of my pain, guide of my path, star of my fortune, so may\nHeaven grant thee in full all thou seekest of it, bethink thee of the place and condition to which absence\nfrom thee has brought me, and make that return in kindness that is due to my fidelity! Oh, lonely trees,\nthat from this day forward shall bear me company in my solitude, give me some sign by the gentle\nmovement of your boughs that my presence is not distasteful to you! Oh, thou, my squire, pleasant\ncompanion in my prosperous and adverse fortunes, fix well in thy memory what thou shalt see me do\nhere, so that thou mayest relate and report it to the sole cause of all,\" and so saying he dismounted from\nRocinante, and in an instant relieved him of saddle and bridle, and giving him a slap on the croup, said,\n\"He gives thee freedom who is bereft of it himself, oh steed as excellent in deed as thou art unfortunate in\nthy lot; begone where thou wilt, for thou bearest written on thy forehead that neither Astolfo's hippogriff,\nnor the famed Frontino that cost Bradamante so dear, could equal thee in speed.\"\nSeeing this Sancho said, \"Good luck to him who has saved us the trouble of stripping the pack-saddle off\nDapple! By my faith he would not have gone without a slap on the croup and something said in his praise;\nthough if he were here I would not let anyone strip him, for there would be no occasion, as he had nothing\nof the lover or victim of despair about him, inasmuch as his master, which I was while it was God's\npleasure, was nothing of the sort; and indeed, Sir Knight of Regretful Appearance, if my departure and\nyour worship's madness are to come off in earnest, it will be as well to saddle Rocinante again in order\nthat he may supply the want of Dapple, because it will save me time in going and returning: for if I go on\nfoot I don't know when I shall get there or when I shall get back, as I am, in truth, a bad walker.\"\n\"I declare, Sancho,\" returned Don Quixote, \"it shall be as thou wilt, for thy plan does not seem to me a\nbad one, and three days hence thou wilt depart, for I wish thee to observe in the meantime what I do and\n-88\n\nsay for her sake, that thou mayest be able to tell it.\"\n\"But what more have I to see besides what I have seen?\" said Sancho.\n\"Much thou knowest about it!\" said Don Quixote. \"I have now got to tear up my garments, to scatter\nabout my armour, knock my head against these rocks, and more of the same sort of thing, which thou\nmust witness.\"\n\"For the love of God,\" said Sancho, \"be careful, your worship, how you give yourself those knocks on the\nhead, for you may come across such a rock, and in such a way, that the very first may put an end to the\nwhole contrivance of this penance; and I should think, if indeed knocks on the head seem necessary to\nyou, and this business cannot be done without them, you might be content--as the whole thing is feigned,\nand counterfeit, and in joke--you might be content, I say, with giving them to yourself in the water, or\nagainst something soft, like cotton; and leave it all to me; for I'll tell my lady that your worship knocked\nyour head against a point of rock harder than a diamond.\"\n\"I thank thee for thy good intentions, friend Sancho,\" answered Don Quixote, \"but I would have thee\nknow that all these things I am doing are not in joke, but very much in earnest, for anything else would be\na transgression of the ordinances of chivalry, which forbid us to tell any lie whatever under the penalties\ndue to apostasy; and to do one thing instead of another is just the same as lying; so my knocks on the head\nmust be real, solid, and valid, without anything sophisticated or fanciful about them, and it will be needful\nto leave me some lint to dress my wounds, since fortune has compelled us to do without the balsam we\nlost.\"\n\"It was worse losing the ass,\" replied Sancho, \"for with him lint and all were lost; but I beg of your\nworship not to remind me again of that accursed liquor, for my soul, not to say my stomach, turns at\nhearing the very name of it; and I beg of you, too, to reckon as past the three days you allowed me for\nseeing the mad things you do, for I take them as seen already and pronounced upon, and I will tell\nwonderful stories to my lady; so write the letter and send me off at once, for I long to return and take your\nworship out of this purgatory where I am leaving you.\"\n\"Purgatory dost thou call it, Sancho?\" said Don Quixote, \"rather call it hell, or even worse if there be\nanything worse.\"\n\"For one who is in hell,\" said Sancho, \"nulla est retentio, as I have heard say.\"\n\"I do not understand what retentio means,\" said Don Quixote.\n\"Retentio,\" answered Sancho, \"means that whoever is in hell never comes nor can come out of it, which\nwill be the opposite case with your worship or my legs will be idle, that is if I have spurs to enliven\nRocinante: let me once get to El Toboso and into the presence of my lady Dulcinea, and I will tell her\nsuch things of the follies and madnesses (for it is all one) that your worship has done and is still doing,\nthat I will manage to make her softer than a glove though I find her harder than a cork tree; and with her\nsweet and honeyed answer I will come back through the air like a witch, and take your worship out of this\npurgatory that seems to be hell but is not, as there is hope of getting out of it; which, as I have said, those\nin hell have not, and I believe your worship will not say anything to the contrary.\"\n\"That is true,\" said he of Regretful Appearance, \"but how shall we manage to write the letter?\"\n\"And the ass-colt order too,\" added Sancho.\n-89\n\n\"All shall be included,\" said Don Quixote; \"and as there is no paper, it would be well done to write it on\nthe leaves of trees, as the ancients did, or on tablets of wax; though that would be as hard to find just now\nas paper. But it has just occurred to me how it may be conveniently and even more than conveniently\nwritten, and that is in the note-book that belonged to Cardenio, and thou wilt take care to have it copied\non paper, in a good hand, at the first village thou comest to where there is a schoolmaster, or if not, any\nsacristan will copy it; but see thou give it not to any notary to copy, for they write a law hand that Satan\ncould not make out.\"\n\"But what is to be done about the signature?\" said Sancho.\n\"The letters of Amadis were never signed,\" said Don Quixote.\n\"That is all very well,\" said Sancho, \"but the order must needs be signed, and if it is copied they will say\nthe signature is false, and I shall be left without ass-colts.\"\n\"The order shall go signed in the same book,\" said Don Quixote, \"and on seeing it my niece will make no\ndifficulty about obeying it; as to the loveletter thou canst put by way of signature, 'Yours till death, the\nKnight of Regretful Appearance.' And it will be no great matter if it is in some other person's hand, for as\nwell as I recollect Dulcinea can neither read nor write, nor in the whole course of her life has she seen\nhandwriting or letter of mine, for my love and hers have been always platonic, not going beyond a modest\nlook, and even that so seldom that I can safely swear I have not seen her four times in all these twelve\nyears I have been loving her more than the light of these eyes that the earth will one day devour; and\nperhaps even of those four times she has not once perceived that I was looking at her: such is the\nretirement and seclusion in which her father Lorenzo Corchuelo and her mother Aldonza Nogales have\nbrought her up.\"\n\"So, so!\" said Sancho; \"Lorenzo Corchuelo's daughter is the lady Dulcinea del Toboso, otherwise called\nAldonza Lorenzo?\"\n\"She it is,\" said Don Quixote, \"and she it is that is worthy to be lady of the whole universe.\"\n\"I know her well,\" said Sancho, \"and let me tell you she can fling a crowbar as well as the lustiest lad in\nall the town. Giver of all good! but she is a brave lass, and a right and stout one, and fit to be helpmate to\nany knight-errant that is or is to be, who may make her his lady: the whoreson wench, what sting she has\nand what a voice! I can tell you one day she posted herself on the top of the belfry of the village to call\nsome labourers of theirs that were in a ploughed field of her father's, and though they were better than\nhalf a league off they heard her as well as if they were at the foot of the tower; and the best of her is that\nshe is not a bit prudish, for she has plenty of affability, and jokes with everybody, and has a grin and a\njest for everything. So, Sir Knight of Regretful Appearance, I say you not only may and ought to do mad\nfreaks for her sake, but you have a good right to give way to despair and hang yourself; and no one who\nknows of it but will say you did well, though the devil should take you; and I wish I were on my road\nalready, simply to see her, for it is many a day since I saw her, and she must be altered by this time, for\ngoing about the fields always, and the sun and the air spoil women's looks greatly. But I must own the\ntruth to your worship, Senor Don Quixote; until now I have been under a great mistake, for I believed\ntruly and honestly that the lady Dulcinea must be some princess your worship was in love with, or some\nperson great enough to deserve the rich presents you have sent her, such as the Biscayan and the galley\nslaves, and many more no doubt, for your worship must have won many victories in the time when I was\nnot yet your squire. But all things considered, what good can it do the lady Aldonza Lorenzo, I mean the\nlady Dulcinea del Toboso, to have the vanquished your worship sends or will send coming to her and\ngoing down on their knees before her? Because may be when they came she'd be hackling flax or\nthreshing on the threshing floor, and they'd be ashamed to see her, and she'd laugh, or resent the present.\"\n-90\n\n\"I have before now told thee many times, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"that thou art a mighty great\nchatterer, and that with a blunt wit thou art always striving at sharpness; but to show thee what a fool thou\nart and how rational I am, I would have thee listen to a short story. Thou must know that a certain widow,\nfair, young, independent, and rich, and above all free and easy, fell in love with a sturdy strapping young\nlay-brother; his superior came to know of it, and one day said to the worthy widow by way of brotherly\nremonstrance, 'I am surprised, senora, and not without good reason, that a woman of such high standing,\nso fair, and so rich as you are, should have fallen in love with such a mean, low, stupid fellow as\nSo-and-so, when in this house there are so many masters, graduates, and divinity students from among\nwhom you might choose as if they were a lot of pears, saying this one I'll take, that I won't take;' but she\nreplied to him with great sprightliness and candour, 'My dear sir, you are very much mistaken, and your\nideas are very old-fashioned, if you think that I have made a bad choice in So-and-so, fool as he seems;\nbecause for all I want with him he knows as much and more philosophy than Aristotle.' In the same way,\nSancho, for all I want with Dulcinea del Toboso she is just as good as the most exalted princess on earth.\nIt is not to be supposed that all those poets who sang the praises of ladies under the fancy names they give\nthem, had any such mistresses. Thinkest thou that the Amarillises, the Phillises, the Sylvias, the Dianas,\nthe Galateas, the Filidas, and all the rest of them, that the books, the ballads, the barber's shops, the\ntheatres are full of, were really and truly ladies of flesh and blood, and mistresses of those that glorify and\nhave glorified them? Nothing of the kind; they only invent them for the most part to furnish a subject for\ntheir verses, and that they may pass for lovers, or for men valiant enough to be so; and so it suffices me to\nthink and believe that the good Aldonza Lorenzo is fair and virtuous; and as to her pedigree it is very little\nmatter, for no one will examine into it for the purpose of conferring any order upon her, and I, for my\npart, reckon her the most exalted princess in the world. For thou shouldst know, Sancho, if thou dost not\nknow, that two things alone beyond all others are incentives to love, and these are great beauty and a\ngood name, and these two things are to be found in Dulcinea in the highest degree, for in beauty no one\nequals her and in good name few approach her; and to put the whole thing in a nutshell, I persuade myself\nthat all I say is as I say, neither more nor less, and I picture her in my imagination as I would have her to\nbe, as well in beauty as in condition; Helen approaches her not nor does Lucretia come up to her, nor any\nother of the famous women of times past, Greek, Barbarian, or Latin; and let each say what he will, for if\nin this I am taken to task by the ignorant, I shall not be censured by the critical.\"\n\"I say that your worship is entirely right,\" said Sancho, \"and that I am an ass. But I know not how the\nname of ass came into my mouth, for a rope is not to be mentioned in the house of him who has been\nhanged; but now for the letter, and then, God be with you, I am off.\"\nDon Quixote took out the note-book, and, retiring to one side, very deliberately began to write the letter,\nand when he had finished it he called to Sancho, saying he wished to read it to him, so that he might\ncommit it to memory, in case of losing it on the road; for with evil fortune like his anything might be\napprehended. To which Sancho replied, \"Write it two or three times there in the book and give it to me,\nand I will carry it very carefully, because to expect me to keep it in my memory is all nonsense, for I have\nsuch a bad one that I often forget my own name; but for all that repeat it to me, as I shall like to hear it,\nfor surely it will run as if it was in print.\"\n\"Listen,\" said Don Quixote, \"this is what it says:\n\"DON QUIXOTE'S LETTER TO DULCINEA DEL TOBOSO\n\"Sovereign and exalted Lady,--The pierced by the point of absence, the wounded to the heart's core,\nsends thee, sweetest Dulcinea del Toboso, the health that he himself enjoys not. If thy beauty despises me,\nif thy worth is not for me, if thy scorn is my affliction, though I be sufficiently long-suffering, hardly\nshall I endure this anxiety, which, besides being oppressive, is protracted. My good squire Sancho will\nrelate to thee in full, fair ingrate, dear enemy, the condition to which I am reduced on thy account: if it be\n-91\n\nthy pleasure to give me relief, I am thine; if not, do as may be pleasing to thee; for by ending my life I\nshall satisfy thy cruelty and my desire.\n\"Thine till death,\n\"The Knight of Regretful Appearance.\"\n\"By the life of my father,\" said Sancho, when he heard the letter, \"it is the loftiest thing I ever heard.\nBody of me! how your worship says everything as you like in it! And how well you fit in 'The Knight of\nRegretful Appearance' into the signature. I declare your worship is indeed the very devil, and there is\nnothing you don't know.\"\n\"Everything is needed for the calling I follow,\" said Don Quixote.\n\"Now then,\" said Sancho, \"let your worship put the order for the three ass-colts on the other side, and\nsign it very plainly, that they may recognise it at first sight.\"\n\"With all my heart,\" said Don Quixote, and as he had written it he read it to this effect:\n\"Mistress Niece,--By this first of ass-colts please pay to Sancho Panza, my squire, three of the five I left\nat home in your charge: said three ass-colts to be paid and delivered for the same number received here in\nhand, which upon this and upon his receipt shall be duly paid. Done in the heart of the Sierra Morena, the\ntwenty-seventh of August of this present year.\"\n\"That will do,\" said Sancho; \"now let your worship sign it.\"\n\"There is no need to sign it,\" said Don Quixote, \"but merely to put my flourish, which is the same as a\nsignature, and enough for three asses, or even three hundred.\"\n\"I can trust your worship,\" returned Sancho; \"let me go and saddle Rocinante, and be ready to give me\nyour blessing, for I mean to go at once without seeing the fooleries your worship is going to do; I'll say I\nsaw you do so many that she will not want any more.\"\n\"At any rate, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"I should like--and there is reason for it--I should like thee, I\nsay, to see me stripped to the skin and performing a dozen or two of insanities, which I can get done in\nless than half an hour; for having seen them with thine own eyes, thou canst then safely swear to the rest\nthat thou wouldst add; and I promise thee thou wilt not tell of as many as I mean to perform.\"\n\"For the love of God, master mine,\" said Sancho, \"let me not see your worship stripped, for it will sorely\ngrieve me, and I shall not be able to keep from tears, and my head aches so with all I shed last night for\nDapple, that I am not fit to begin any fresh weeping; but if it is your worship's pleasure that I should see\nsome insanities, do them in your clothes, short ones, and such as come readiest to hand; for I myself want\nnothing of the sort, and, as I have said, it will be a saving of time for my return, which will be with the\nnews your worship desires and deserves. If not, let the lady Dulcinea look to it; if she does not answer\nreasonably, I swear as solemnly as I can that I will fetch a fair answer out of her stomach with kicks and\ncuffs; for why should it be borne that a knight-errant as famous as your worship should go mad without\nrhyme or reason for a--? Her ladyship had best not drive me to say it, for by God I will speak out and let\noff everything cheap, even if it doesn't sell: I am pretty good at that! she little knows me; faith, if she\nknew me she'd be in awe of me.\"\n\"In faith, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"to all appearance thou art no sounder in thy wits than I.\"\n-92\n\n\"I am not so mad,\" answered Sancho, \"but I am more peppery; but apart from all this, what has your\nworship to eat until I come back? Will you sally out on the road like Cardenio to force it from the\nshepherds?\"\n\"Let not that anxiety trouble thee,\" replied Don Quixote, \"for even if I had it I should not eat anything but\nthe herbs and the fruits which this meadow and these trees may yield me; the beauty of this business of\nmine lies in not eating, and in performing other mortifications.\"\n\"Do you know what I am afraid of?\" said Sancho upon this; \"that I shall not be able to find my way back\nto this spot where I am leaving you, it is such an out-of-the-way place.\"\n\"Observe the landmarks well,\" said Don Quixote, \"for I will try not to go far from this neighbourhood,\nand I will even take care to mount the highest of these rocks to see if I can discover thee returning;\nhowever, not to miss me and lose thyself, the best plan will be to cut some branches of the broom that is\nso abundant about here, and as thou goest to lay them at intervals until thou hast come out upon the plain;\nthese will serve thee, after the fashion of the clue in the labyrinth of Theseus, as marks and signs for\nfinding me on thy return.\"\n\"So I will,\" said Sancho Panza, and having cut some, he asked his master's blessing, and not without\nmany tears on both sides, took his leave of him, and mounting Rocinante, of whom Don Quixote charged\nhim earnestly to have as much care as of his own person, he set out for the plain, strewing at intervals the\nbranches of broom as his master had recommended him; and so he went his way, though Don Quixote\nstill entreated him to see him do were it only a couple of mad acts. He had not gone a hundred paces,\nhowever, when he returned and said:\n\"I must say, senor, your worship said quite right, that in order to be able to swear without a weight on my\nconscience that I had seen you do mad things, it would be well for me to see if it were only one; though in\nyour worship's remaining here I have seen a very great one.\"\n\"Did I not tell thee so?\" said Don Quixote. \"Wait, Sancho, and I will do them in the saying of a credo,\"\nand pulling off his breeches in all haste he stripped himself to his skin and his shirt, and then, without\nmore ado, he cut a couple of gambados in the air, and a couple of somersaults, heels over head, making\nsuch a display that, not to see it a second time, Sancho wheeled Rocinante round, and felt easy, and\nsatisfied in his mind that he could swear he had left his master mad; and so we will leave him to follow\nhis road until his return, which was a quick one.\nCHAPTER XXVI.\nIN WHICH ARE CONTINUED THE REFINEMENTS WHEREWITH DON QUIXOTE PLAYED THE\nPART OF A LOVER IN THE SIERRA MORENA\nReturning to the doings of the Knight of Regretful Appearance, the history says that when he found\nhimself alone, having completed the performance of the somersaults and capers, naked from the waist\ndown and clothed from the waist up, and saw that Sancho had gone off without waiting to see any more\ncrazy feats, Don Quixote climbed up to the top of a high rock, and there set himself to consider what he\nhad several times before considered without ever coming to any conclusion on the point, namely whether\nit would be better and more to his purpose to imitate the outrageous madness of Roland, or the\nmelancholy madness of Amadis of Gaul; and communing with himself he said:\n\"What wonder is it if Roland was so good a knight and so valiant as everyone says he was, when, after\nall, he was enchanted, and nobody could kill him save by thrusting a corking pin into the sole of his foot,\n-93\n\nand he always wore shoes with seven iron soles? But putting the question of his valour aside, let us come\nto his losing his wits, for certain it is that he did lose them in consequence of the proofs he discovered at\nthe fountain, and the intelligence the shepherd gave him of Angelica having slept more than two siestas\nwith Medoro, a little curly-headed Moor, and page to Agramante. If he was persuaded that this was true,\nand that his lady had wronged him, it is no wonder that he should have gone mad; but I, how am I to\nimitate him in his madness, unless I can imitate him in the cause of it? For my Dulcinea, I will venture to\nswear, never saw a Moor in her life, and I should plainly be doing her a wrong if, fancying anything else,\nI were to go mad with the same kind of madness as Roland the Furious. On the other hand, I see that\nAmadis of Gaul, without losing his senses and without doing anything mad, acquired as a lover as much\nfame as the most famous; and if this be true, as it is, why should I now take the trouble to strip stark\nnaked, or do mischief to these trees which have done me no harm, or why am I to disturb the clear waters\nof these brooks which will give me to drink whenever I have a mind? Long live the memory of Amadis\nand let him be imitated so far as is possible by Don Quixote of La Mancha, of whom it will be said, as\nwas said of the other, that if he did not achieve great things, he died in attempting them; and if I am not\nrepulsed or rejected by my Dulcinea, it is enough for me, as I have said, to be absent from her.?\" In this\nway, and in sighing and calling on the fauns and satyrs of the woods and the nymphs of the streams, and\nEcho, moist and mournful, to answer, console, and hear him, as well as in looking for herbs to sustain\nhim, he passed his time until Sancho's return; and had that been delayed three weeks, as it was three days,\nthe Knight of Regretful Appearance would have worn such an altered countenance that the mother that\nbore him would not have known him: and here it will be well to leave him, wrapped up in sighs and\nverses, to relate how Sancho Panza fared on his mission.\nAs for him, coming out upon the high road, he made for El Toboso, and the next day reached the inn\nwhere the mishap of the blanket had befallen him. As soon as he recognised it he felt as if he were once\nmore living through the air, and he could not bring himself to enter it though it was an hour when he\nmight well have done so, for it was dinner-time, and he longed to taste something hot as it had been all\ncold fare with him for many days past. This craving drove him to draw near to the inn, still undecided\nwhether to go in or not, and as he was hesitating there came out two persons who at once recognised him,\nand said one to the other:\n\"Senor curate, is not he on the horse there Sancho Panza who, our adventurer's housekeeper told us, went\noff with her master as esquire?\"\n\"So it is,\" said the curate, \"and that is our friend Don Quixote's horse;\" and if they knew him so well it\nwas because they were the curate and the barber of his own village, the same who had carried out the\nscrutiny and sentence upon the books; and as soon as they recognised Sancho Panza and Rocinante, being\nanxious to hear of Don Quixote, they approached, and calling him by his name the curate said, \"Friend\nSancho Panza, where is your master?\"\nSancho recognised them at once, and determined to keep secret the place and circumstances where and\nunder which he had left his master, so he replied that his master was engaged in a certain quarter on a\ncertain matter of great importance to him which he could not disclose for the eyes in his head.\n\"Nay, nay,\" said the barber, \"if you don't tell us where he is, Sancho Panza, we will suspect as we suspect\nalready, that you have murdered and robbed him, for here you are mounted on his horse; in fact, you must\nproduce the master of the hack, or else take the consequences.\"\n\"There is no need of threats with me,\" said Sancho, \"for I am not a man to rob or murder anybody; let his\nown fate, or God who made him, kill each one; my master is engaged very much to his taste doing\npenance in the midst of these mountains;\" and then, offhand and without stopping, he told them how he\nhad left him, what adventures had befallen him, and how he was carrying a letter to the lady Dulcinea del\n-94\n\nToboso, the daughter of Lorenzo Corchuelo, with whom he was over head and ears in love. They were\nboth amazed at what Sancho Panza told them; for though they were aware of Don Quixote's madness and\nthe nature of it, each time they heard of it they were filled with fresh wonder. They then asked Sancho\nPanza to show them the letter he was carrying to the lady Dulcinea del Toboso. He said it was written in a\nnote-book, and that his master's directions were that he should have it copied on paper at the first village\nhe came to. On this the curate said if he showed it to him, he himself would make a fair copy of it. Sancho\nput his hand into his bosom in search of the note-book but could not find it, nor, if he had been searching\nuntil now, could he have found it, for Don Quixote had kept it, and had never given it to him, nor had he\nhimself thought of asking for it. When Sancho discovered he could not find the book his face grew deadly\npale, and in great haste he again felt his body all over, and seeing plainly it was not to be found, without\nmore ado he seized his beard with both hands and plucked away half of it, and then, as quick as he could\nand without stopping, gave himself half a dozen cuffs on the face and nose till they were bathed in blood.\nSeeing this, the curate and the barber asked him what had happened him that he gave himself such rough\ntreatment.\n\"What should happen me?\" replied Sancho, \"but to have lost from one hand to the other, in a moment,\nthree ass-colts, each of them like a castle?\"\n\"How is that?\" said the barber.\n\"I have lost the note-book,\" said Sancho, \"that contained the letter to Dulcinea, and an order signed by my\nmaster in which he directed his niece to give me three ass-colts out of four or five he had at home;\" and\nhe then told them about the loss of Dapple. The curate consoled him, telling him that when his master was\nfound he would get him to renew the order, and make a fresh draft on paper, as was usual and customary;\nfor those made in notebooks were never accepted or honoured. Sancho comforted himself with this, and\nsaid if that were so the loss of Dulcinea's letter did not trouble him much, for he had it almost by heart,\nand it could be taken down from him wherever and whenever they liked.\n\"Repeat it then, Sancho,\" said the barber, \"and we will write it down afterwards.\"\nSancho Panza stopped to scratch his head to bring back the letter to his memory, and balanced himself\nnow on one foot, now the other, one moment staring at the ground, the next at the sky, and after having\nhalf gnawed off the end of a finger and kept them in suspense waiting for him to begin, he said, after a\nlong pause, \"By God, senor curate, devil a thing can I recollect of the letter; but it said at the beginning,\n'Exhausted and sobbing Lady.'\"\n\"It cannot have said 'exhausted and sobbing,'\" said the barber, \"but 'exhalted and sovereign.'\"\n\"That is it,\" said Sancho; \"then, as well as I remember, it went on, 'The wounded, and wanting of sleep,\nand the pierced, kisses your worship's hands, ungrateful and very unrecognised fair one; and it said\nsomething or other about health and sickness that he was sending her; and from that it went tailing off\nuntil it ended with 'Yours till death, the Knight of Regretful Appearance.\"\nIt gave them no little amusement, both of them, to see what a good memory Sancho had, and they\ncomplimented him greatly upon it, and begged him to repeat the letter a couple of times more, so that they\ntoo might get it by heart and write it out by-and-by. Sancho repeated it three times, and as he did, uttered\nthree thousand more absurdities; then he told them more about his master but he never said a word about\nthe blanketing that had befallen himself in that inn, into which he refused to enter. He told them,\nmoreover, how his lord, if he brought him a favourable answer from the lady Dulcinea del Toboso, was to\nput himself in the way of endeavouring to become an emperor, or at least a monarch; for it had been so\n-95\n\nsettled between them, and with his personal worth and the might of his arm it was an easy matter to come\nto be one: and how on becoming one his lord was to make a marriage for him (for he would be a widower\nby that time, as a matter of course) and was to give him as a wife one of the damsels of the empress, the\nheiress of some rich and grand state on the mainland, having nothing to do with islands of any sort, for he\ndid not care for them now. All this Sancho delivered with so much composure--wiping his nose from time\nto time--and with so little common-sense that his two hearers were again filled with wonder at the force of\nDon Quixote's madness that could run away with this poor man's reason. They did not care to take the\ntrouble of disabusing him of his error, as they considered that since it did not in any way hurt his\nconscience it would be better to leave him in it, and they would have all the more amusement in listening\nto his simplicities; and so they bade him pray to God for his lord's health, as it was a very likely and a\nvery feasible thing for him in course of time to come to be an emperor, as he said, or at least an\narchbishop or some other dignitary of equal rank.\nTo which Sancho made answer, \"If fortune, sirs, should bring things about in such a way that my master\nshould have a mind, instead of being an emperor, to be an archbishop, I should like to know what\narchbishops-errant commonly give their squires?\"\n\"They commonly give them,\" said the curate, some simple benefice or cure, or some place as sacristan\nwhich brings them a good fixed income, not counting the altar fees, which may be reckoned at as much\nmore.\"\n\"But for that,\" said Sancho, \"the squire must be unmarried, and must know, at any rate, how to help at\nmass, and if that be so, woe is me, for I am married already and I don't know the first letter of the A B C.\nWhat will become of me if my master takes a fancy to be an archbishop and not an emperor, as is usual\nand customary with knights-errant?\"\n\"Be not uneasy, friend Sancho,\" said the barber, \"for we will entreat your master, and advise him, even\nurging it upon him as a case of conscience, to become an emperor and not an archbishop, because it will\nbe easier for him as he is more of a soldier than a scholar.\"\n\"So I have thought,\" said Sancho; \"though I can tell you he is fit for anything: what I mean to do for my\npart is to pray to our Lord to place him where it may be best for him, and where he may be able to bestow\nmost favours upon me.\"\n\"You speak like a man of sense,\" said the curate, \"and you will be acting like a good Christian; but what\nmust now be done is to take steps to coax your master out of that useless penance you say he is\nperforming; and we had best turn into this inn to consider what plan to adopt, and also to dine, for it is\nnow time.\"\nThey left him and went in, and presently the barber brought him out something to eat. By-and-by, after\nthey had between them carefully thought over what they should do to carry out their object, the curate hit\nupon an idea very well adapted to humour Don Quixote, and effect their purpose; and his notion, which\nhe explained to the barber, was that he himself should assume the disguise of a wandering damsel, while\nthe other should try as best he could to pass for a squire, and that they should thus proceed to where Don\nQuixote was, and he, pretending to be an aggrieved and distressed damsel, should ask a favour of him,\nwhich as a valiant knight-errant he could not refuse to grant; and the favour he meant to ask him was that\nhe should accompany her whither she would conduct him, in order to redress a wrong which a wicked\nknight had done her, while at the same time she should entreat him not to require her to remove her mask,\nnor ask her any question touching her circumstances until he had righted her with the wicked knight. And\nhe had no doubt that Don Quixote would comply with any request made in these terms, and that in this\nway they might remove him and take him to his own village, where they would endeavour to find out if\n-96\n\nhis extraordinary madness admitted of any kind of remedy.\nCHAPTER XXVII.\nOF HOW THE CURATE AND THE BARBER PROCEEDED WITH THEIR SCHEME; TOGETHER\nWITH OTHER MATTERS WORTHY OF RECORD IN THIS GREAT HISTORY\nThe curate's plan did not seem a bad one to the barber, but on the contrary so good that they immediately\nset about putting it in execution. They begged a petticoat and hood of the landlady, leaving her in pledge\na new cassock of the curate's; and the barber made a beard out of a grey-brown or red ox-tail in which the\nlandlord used to stick his comb. The landlady asked them what they wanted these things for, and the\ncurate told her in a few words about the madness of Don Quixote, and how this disguise was intended to\nget him away from the mountain where he then was. The landlord and landlady immediately came to the\nconclusion that the madman was their guest, the balsam man and master of the blanketed squire, and they\ntold the curate all that had passed between him and them, not omitting what Sancho had been so silent\nabout. Finally the landlady dressed up the curate in a style that left nothing to be desired; she put on him a\ncloth petticoat with black velvet stripes a palm broad, all slashed, and a bodice of green velvet set off by a\nbinding of white satin, which as well as the petticoat must have been made in the time of king Wamba.\nThe curate would not let them hood him, but put on his head a little quilted linen cap which he used for a\nnight-cap, and bound his forehead with a strip of black silk, while with another he made a mask with\nwhich he concealed his beard and face very well. He then put on his hat, which was broad enough to\nserve him for an umbrella, and enveloping himself in his cloak seated himself woman-fashion on his\nmule, while the barber mounted his with a beard down to the waist of mingled red and white, for it was,\nas has been said, the tail of a clay-red ox.\nThey took leave of all, and of the good Maritornes, who, sinner as she was, promised to pray a rosary of\nprayers that God might grant them success in such an arduous and Christian undertaking as that they had\nin hand. But hardly had he sallied forth from the inn when it struck the curate that he was doing wrong in\nrigging himself out in that fashion, as it was an indecorous thing for a priest to dress himself that way\neven though much might depend upon it; and saying so to the barber he begged him to change dresses, as\nit was fitter he should be the distressed damsel, while he himself would play the squire's part, which\nwould be less derogatory to his dignity; otherwise he was resolved to have nothing more to do with the\nmatter, and let the devil take Don Quixote. Just at this moment Sancho came up, and on seeing the pair in\nsuch a costume he was unable to restrain his laughter; the barber, however, agreed to do as the curate\nwished, and, altering their plan, the curate went on to instruct him how to play his part and what to say to\nDon Quixote to induce and compel him to come with them and give up his fancy for the place he had\nchosen for his idle penance. The barber told him he could manage it properly without any instruction, and\nas he did not care to dress himself up until they were near where Don Quixote was, he folded up the\ngarments, and the curate adjusted his beard, and they set out under the guidance of Sancho Panza, who\nwent along telling them of the encounter with the madman they met in the Sierra, saying nothing,\nhowever, about the finding of the valise and its contents; for with all his simplicity the lad was a trifle\ncovetous.\nThe next day they reached the place where Sancho had laid the broom-branches as marks to direct him to\nwhere he had left his master, and recognising it he told them that here was the entrance, and that they\nwould do well to dress themselves, if that was required to deliver his master; for they had already told him\nthat going in this guise and dressing in this way were of the highest importance in order to rescue his\nmaster from the pernicious life he had adopted; and they charged him strictly not to tell his master who\nthey were, or that he knew them, and should he ask, as ask he would, if he had given the letter to\nDulcinea, to say that he had, and that, as she did not know how to read, she had given an answer by word\nof mouth, saying that she commanded him, on pain of her displeasure, to come and see her at once; and it\n-97\n\nwas a very important matter for himself, because in this way and with what they meant to say to him they\nfelt sure of bringing him back to a better mode of life and inducing him to take immediate steps to\nbecome an emperor or monarch, for there was no fear of his becoming an archbishop. All this Sancho\nlistened to and fixed it well in his memory, and thanked them heartily for intending to recommend his\nmaster to be an emperor instead of an archbishop, for he felt sure that in the way of bestowing rewards on\ntheir squires emperors could do more than archbishops-errant. He said, too, that it would be as well for\nhim to go on before them to find him, and give him his lady's answer; for that perhaps might be enough\nto bring him away from the place without putting them to all this trouble. They approved of what Sancho\nproposed, and resolved to wait for him until he brought back word of having found his master.\nSancho pushed on into the glens of the Sierra, leaving them in one through which there flowed a little\ngentle rivulet, and where the rocks and trees afforded a cool and grateful shade. It was an August day with\nall the heat of one, and the heat in those parts is intense, and the hour was three in the afternoon, all which\nmade the spot the more inviting and tempted them to wait there for Sancho's return, which they did. They\nwere reposing, then, in the shade, when a voice unaccompanied by the notes of any instrument, but sweet\nand pleasing in its tone, reached their ears, at which they were not a little astonished, as the place did not\nseem to them likely quarters for one who sang so well; for though it is often said that shepherds of rare\nvoice are to be found in the woods and fields, this is rather a flight of the poet's fancy than the truth. And\nstill more surprised were they when they perceived that what they heard sung were the verses not of rustic\nshepherds, but of the polished wits of the city.\nThe song ended with a deep sigh, and again the listeners remained waiting attentively for the singer to\nresume; but perceiving that the music had now turned to sobs and heart-rending moans they determined to\nfind out who the unhappy being could be whose voice was as rare as his sighs were piteous, and they had\nnot proceeded far when on turning the corner of a rock they discovered a man of the same aspect and\nappearance as Sancho had described to them when he told them the story of Cardenio. He, showing no\nastonishment when he saw them, stood still with his head bent down upon his breast like one in deep\nthought, without raising his eyes to look at them after the first glance when they suddenly came upon him.\nThe curate, who was aware of his misfortune and recognised him by the description, being a man of good\naddress, approached him and in a few sensible words entreated and urged him to quit a life of such\nmisery, lest he should end it there, which would be the greatest of all misfortunes. Cardenio was then in\nhis right mind, free from any attack of that madness which so frequently carried him away, and seeing\nthem dressed in a fashion so unusual among the frequenters of those wilds, could not help showing some\nsurprise, especially when he heard them speak of his case as if it were a well-known matter (for the\ncurate's words gave him to understand as much) so he replied to them thus:\n\"I see plainly, sirs, whoever you may be, that Heaven, who rescues the good, and even the wicked very\noften, sends me, though I deserve it not, those who seek to draw me away from this remote and barren\nspot to some better place; but they do not know that if I escape from this evil, I shall fall into another still\ngreater, for I perceive that the effect of the recollection of my misfortunes is so great and works so\npowerfully to my ruin, that in spite of myself I become at times like a stone, without feeling or\nconsciousness; and I come to feel the truth of it when they tell me and show me proofs of the things I\nhave done when the terrible fit overmasters me; and all I can do is bewail my lot in vain, and idly curse\nmy destiny, and plead for my madness by telling how it was caused, to any that care to hear it; for no\nreasonable beings on learning the cause will wonder at the effects; and if they cannot help me at least they\nwill not blame me, and the repugnance they feel at my wild ways will turn into pity for my woes. If it be,\nsirs, that you are here with the same design as others who have come before you, I entreat you to hear the\nstory of my countless misfortunes, for perhaps when you have heard it you will spare yourselves the\ntrouble you would take in offering consolation to grief that is beyond the reach of it.\"\nAs they both desired nothing more than to hear from his own lips the cause of his suffering, they\n-98\n\nentreated him to tell it, promising not to do anything for his relief or comfort that he did not wish; and\nthereupon the unhappy gentleman began his sad story in nearly the same words and manner in which he\nhad related it to Don Quixote and the goatherd a few days before, when, through Master Elisabad, and\nDon Quixote's scrupulous observance of what was due to chivalry, the tale was left unfinished, as this\nhistory has already recorded; but now fortunately the mad fit kept off, allowed him to tell it to the end;\nand so, coming to the incident of the letter which Don Fernando had found in the volume of \"Amadis of\nGaul,\" Cardenio said that he knew it by heart and that it was in these words:\n\"Luscinda to Cardenio: Every day I discover merits in you that oblige and compel me to hold you in\nhigher estimation; so if you desire to relieve me of this obligation without cost to my honour, you may\neasily do so. I have a father who knows you and loves me dearly, who without putting any constraint on\nmy inclination will grant what will be reasonable for you to have, if it be that you value me as you say\nand as I believe you do.\"\n\"By this letter I was induced, as I told you, to demand Luscinda for my wife, and it was through it that\nLuscinda came to be regarded by Don Fernando as one of the most discreet and prudent women of the\nday, and this letter it was that suggested his design of ruining me before mine could be carried into effect.\nI told Don Fernando that all Luscinda's father was waiting for was that mine should ask her of him, which\nI did not dare to suggest to him, fearing that he would not consent to do so; not because he did not know\nperfectly well the rank, goodness, virtue, and beauty of Luscinda, and that she had qualities that would do\nhonour to any family in Spain, but because I was aware that he did not wish me to marry so soon, before\nseeing what the Duke Ricardo would do for me. In short, I told him I did not venture to mention it to my\nfather, as well on account of that difficulty, as of many others that discouraged me though I knew not well\nwhat they were, only that it seemed to me that what I desired was never to come to pass. To all this Don\nFernando answered that he would take it upon himself to speak to my father, and persuade him to speak\nto Luscinda's father. O, ambitious Marius! O, cruel Catiline! O, wicked Sylla! O, perfidious Ganelon! O,\ntreacherous Vellido! O, vindictive Julian! O, covetous Judas! Traitor, cruel, vindictive, and perfidious,\nwherein had this poor wretch failed in his fidelity, who with such frankness showed thee the secrets and\nthe joys of his heart? What offence did I commit? What words did I utter, or what counsels did I give that\nhad not the furtherance of thy honour and welfare for their aim? But, woe is me, wherefore do I\ncomplain? for sure it is that when misfortunes spring from the stars, descending from on high they fall\nupon us with such fury and violence that no power on earth can check their course nor human device stay\ntheir coming. Who could have thought that Don Fernando, a highborn gentleman, intelligent, bound to me\nby gratitude for my services, one that could win the object of his love wherever he might set his\naffections, could have become so obdurate, as they say, as to rob me of my one ewe lamb that was not\neven yet in my possession? But laying aside these useless and unavailing reflections, let us take up the\nbroken thread of my unhappy story.\n\"To proceed, then: Don Fernando finding my presence an obstacle to the execution of his treacherous and\nwicked design, resolved to send me to his elder brother under the pretext of asking money from him to\npay for six horses which, purposely, and with the sole object of sending me away that he might the better\ncarry out his infernal scheme, he had purchased the very day he offered to speak to my father, and the\nprice of which he now desired me to fetch. Could I have anticipated this treachery? Could I by any chance\nhave suspected it? Nay; so far from that, I offered with the greatest pleasure to go at once, in my\nsatisfaction at the good bargain that had been made. That night I spoke with Luscinda, and told her what\nhad been agreed upon with Don Fernando, and how I had strong hopes of our fair and reasonable wishes\nbeing realised. She, as unsuspicious as I was of the treachery of Don Fernando, bade me try to return\nspeedily, as she believed the fulfilment of our desires would be delayed only so long as my father put off\nspeaking to hers. I know not why it was that on saying this to me her eyes filled with tears, and there\ncame a lump in her throat that prevented her from uttering another.\n-99\n\n\"I reached the place whither I had been sent, gave the letter to Don Fernando's brother, and was kindly\nreceived but not promptly dismissed, for he desired me to wait, very much against my will, eight days in\nsome place where the duke his father was not likely to see me, as his brother wrote that the money was to\nbe sent without the duke's knowledge; all of which was a scheme of the treacherous Don Fernando, for\nhis brother had no want of money to enable him to despatch me at once.\n\"The command was one that exposed me to the temptation of disobeying it, as it seemed to me impossible\nto endure life for so many days separated from Luscinda. But four days later there came a man in quest of\nme with a letter which he gave me, and which by the address I perceived to be from Luscinda, as the\nwriting was hers. I opened it with fear and trepidation, persuaded that it must be something serious that\nhad impelled her to write to me when at a distance, as she seldom did so when I was near. Before reading\nit I asked the man who it was that had given it to him, and how long he had been upon the road; he told\nme that as he happened to be passing through one of the streets of the city at the hour of noon, a very\nbeautiful lady called to him from a window, and with tears in her eyes said to him hurriedly, 'Brother, if\nyou are, as you seem to be, a Christian, for the love of God I entreat you to have this letter despatched\nwithout a moment's delay to the place and person named in the address, all which is well known, and by\nthis you will render a great service to our Lord; and that you may be at no inconvenience in doing so take\nwhat is in this handkerchief;' and said he, 'with this she threw me a handkerchief out of the window in\nwhich were tied up a hundred reals and this gold ring which I bring here together with the letter I have\ngiven you. And then without waiting for any answer she left the window, though not before she saw me\ntake the letter and the handkerchief, and I had by signs let her know that I would do as she bade me; and\nso, seeing myself so well paid for the trouble I would have in bringing it to you, and knowing by the\naddress that it was to you it was sent (for, senor, I know you very well), and also unable to resist that\nbeautiful lady's tears, I resolved to trust no one else, but to come myself and give it to you, and in sixteen\nhours from the time when it was given me I have made the journey, which, as you know, is eighteen\nleagues.'\n\"All the while the good-natured improvised courier was telling me this, I hung upon his words, my legs\ntrembling under me so that I could scarcely stand. However, I opened the letter and read these words:\n\"'The promise Don Fernando gave you to urge your father to speak to mine, he has fulfilled much more\nto his own satisfaction than to your advantage. I have to tell you, senor, that he has demanded me for a\nwife, and my father, led away by what he considers Don Fernando's superiority over you, has favoured\nhis suit so cordially, that in two days hence the betrothal is to take place with such secrecy and so\nprivately that the only witnesses are to be the Heavens above and a few of the household. Picture to\nyourself the state I am in; judge if it be urgent for you to come; the issue of the affair will show you\nwhether I love you or not. God grant this may come to your hand before mine shall be forced to link itself\nwith his who keeps so ill the faith that he has pledged.'\n\"Such were the words that made me set out at once for I now saw clearly that it was his own pleasure that\nhad made Don Fernando send me to his brother. The exasperation I felt joined with the fear of losing the\nprize I had won by so many years of love and devotion, lent me wings; so that almost flying I reached\nhome the same day. I arrived unobserved, and left the mule on which I had come at the house of the\nworthy man who had brought me the letter, and fortune was pleased to be for once so kind that I found\nLuscinda at the grating that was the witness of our loves. She recognised me at once, and I her, but not as\nshe ought to have recognised me, or I her. But who is there in the world that can boast of having fathomed\nor understood the wavering mind and unstable nature of a woman? Of a truth no one. To proceed: as soon\nas Luscinda saw me she said, 'Cardenio, I am in my bridal dress, and the treacherous Don Fernando and\nmy covetous father are waiting for me in the hall with the other witnesses, who shall be the witnesses of\nmy death before they witness my betrothal. Be not distressed, my friend, but contrive to be present at this\nsacrifice, and if that cannot be prevented by my words, I have a dagger concealed which will prevent\n-100\n\nmore deliberate violence, putting an end to my life and giving thee a first proof of the love I have borne\nand bear thee.' I replied to her distractedly and hastily, in fear lest I should not have time to reply, 'May\nthy words be verified by thy deeds, lady; and if thou hast a dagger to save thy honour, I have a sword to\ndefend thee or kill myself if fortune be against us.'\n\"I think she could not have heard all these words, for I perceived that they called her away in haste, as the\nbridegroom was waiting. I nerved myself as best I could and went in, for I well knew all the entrances and\noutlets; and besides, with the confusion that in secret pervaded the house no one took notice of me, so,\nwithout being seen, I found an opportunity of placing myself in the recess formed by a window of the hall\nitself, and concealed by the ends and borders of two tapestries, from between which I could, without\nbeing seen, see all that took place in the room. Who could describe the agitation of heart I suffered as I\nstood there--the thoughts that came to me--the reflections that passed through my mind? They were such\nas cannot be, nor were it well they should be, told. Suffice it to say that the bridegroom entered the hall in\nhis usual dress; as groomsman he had with him a cousin of Luscinda's and except the servants of the\nhouse there was no one else in the chamber. Soon afterwards Luscinda came out from an antechamber,\nattended by her mother and two of her damsels, arrayed and adorned as became her rank and beauty, and\nin full festival and ceremonial attire. Oh memory, mortal foe of my peace! why bring before me now the\nincomparable beauty of that adored enemy of mine? Were it not better, cruel memory, to remind me and\nrecall what she then did, that stirred by a wrong so glaring I may seek, if not vengeance now, at least to\nrid myself of life? Do not grow weary, gentlemen of hearing these digressions of mind, for my tale of\nwoe cannot be briefly or lightly told, since every incident in it seems to me to need lengthy explanation.\"\nTo this the curate replied that not only were they not weary of hearing his tale, but that they welcomed the\ndetails that could not be passed over in silence and merited as much attention as the main part of the story.\nThen Cardenio continued, \"All being assembled in the hall, the priest of the parish came in and as he took\nthe pair by the hand to perform the requisite ceremony, at the words, 'Will you, Senora Luscinda, take\nSenor Don Fernando, here present, for your lawful husband, as the holy Mother Church ordains?' I thrust\nmy head and neck out from between the tapestries to listen to Luscinda's answer, awaiting in her reply the\nsentence of death or the grant of life. The priest, too, stood waiting for the answer of Luscinda, who for a\nlong time withheld it; and just as I thought she was taking out the dagger to save her honour, or struggling\nfor words to make some declaration of the truth on my behalf, I heard her say in a faint and feeble voice,\n'I will.' Don Fernando said the same, and giving her the ring they stood linked by a knot that could never\nbe loosed. The bridegroom then approached to embrace his bride; and she, pressing her hand upon her\nheart, fell fainting in her mother's arms. It only remains now for me to tell you the state I was in when in\nthat consent that I heard I saw all my hopes mocked, the words and promises of Luscinda proved\nfalsehoods, and the recovery of the prize I had that instant lost rendered impossible for ever. My whole\nframe glowed with rage and jealousy. Meanwhile, all were thrown into confusion by Luscinda's fainting,\nand as her mother was unlacing her to give her air a sealed paper was discovered in her bosom which Don\nFernando seized at once and began to read by the light of one of the torches. As soon as he had read it he\nseated himself in a chair, leaning his cheek on his hand in the attitude of one deep in thought, without\ntaking any part in the efforts that were being made to recover his bride from her fainting fit.\n\"Seeing all the household in confusion, I ventured to come out regardless whether I were seen or not, and\ndetermined, if I were, to do some frenzied deed that would prove to all the world the righteous\nindignation of my breast in the punishment of the treacherous Don Fernando, and even in that of the\nfickle fainting traitress. But my fate, doubtless reserving me for greater sorrows, if such there be, so\nordered it that just then I had enough and to spare of that reason which has since been wanting to me; and\nso, without seeking to take vengeance on my greatest enemies (which might have been easily taken, as all\nthought of me was so far from their minds), I resolved to take it upon myself, and on myself to inflict the\npain they deserved, perhaps with even greater severity. I quit the house and reached that of the man with\n-101\n\nwhom I had left my mule; I made him saddle it for me, mounted without bidding him farewell, and rode\nout of the city, like another Lot, not daring to turn my head to look back upon it.\nI journeyed onward for the remainder of the night, and by daybreak I reached one of the passes of these\nmountains, among which I wandered for three days more without taking any path or road, until I came to\nsome meadows lying on I know not which side of the mountains, and there I inquired of some herdsmen\nin what direction the most rugged part of the range lay. They told me that it was in this quarter, and I at\nonce directed my course hither, intending to end my life here; but as I was making my way among these\ncrags, my mule dropped dead through fatigue and hunger, or, as I think more likely, in order to have done\nwith such a worthless burden as it bore in me. Most commonly my dwelling is the hollow of a cork tree\nlarge enough to shelter this miserable body; the goatherds who frequent these mountains, moved by\ncompassion, furnish me with food, leaving it by the wayside or on the rocks, where they think I may\nperhaps pass and find it; and so, even though I may be then out of my senses, the wants of nature teach\nme what is required to sustain me, and make me crave it and eager to take it. They tell me when they find\nme in a rational mood, that I sometimes rush out madly upon the road, and snatch food by force from the\nshepherds who would gladly give it to me. Thus do pass my wretched life, until it be Heaven's will to\nbring it to a close, or so to order my memory that I no longer recollect the beauty and treachery of\nLuscinda, or the wrong done me by Don Fernando; for if it will do this without depriving me of life, I will\nturn my thoughts into some better channel; if not, I can only implore it to have full mercy on my soul, for\nin myself I feel no power or strength to release my body from this strait in which I have of my own\naccord chosen to place it.\nHere Cardenio brought to a close his long discourse and story, as full of misfortune as it was of love; but\njust as the curate was going to address some words of comfort to him, he was stopped by a voice that\nreached his ear, saying in melancholy tones what will be told in the Fourth Part of this narrative; for at\nthis point the sage and sagacious historian, Cide Hamete Benengeli, brought the Third to a conclusion.\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\nWHICH TREATS OF THE STRANGE AND DELIGHTFUL ADVENTURE THAT BEFELL THE\nCURATE AND THE BARBER IN THE SAME SIERRA\nHappy and fortunate were the times when that most daring knight Don Quixote of La Mancha was sent\ninto the world; for by reason of his having formed a resolution so honourable as that of seeking to revive\nand restore to the world the long-lost and almost defunct order of knight-errantry, we now enjoy in this\nage of ours, so poor in light entertainment, not only the charm of his veracious history, but also of the\ntales and episodes contained in it which are, in a measure, no less pleasing, ingenious, and truthful, than\nthe history itself; which, resuming its thread, carded, spun, and wound, relates that just as the curate was\ngoing to offer consolation to Cardenio, he was interrupted by a voice that fell upon his ear saying in\nplaintive tones:\n\"O God! is it possible I have found a place that may serve as a secret grave for the weary load of this\nbody that I support so unwillingly? If the solitude these mountains promise deceives me not, it is so; ah!\nwoe is me! how much more grateful to my mind will be the society of these rocks and brakes that permit\nme to complain of my misfortune to Heaven, than that of any human being, for there is none on earth to\nlook to for counsel in doubt, comfort in sorrow, or relief in distress!\"\nAll this was heard distinctly by the curate and those with him, and as it seemed to them to be uttered close\nby, as indeed it was, they got up to look for the speaker, and before they had gone twenty paces they\ndiscovered behind a rock, seated at the foot of an ash tree, a youth in the dress of a peasant, whose face\nthey were unable at the moment to see as he was leaning forward, bathing his feet in the brook that\n-102\n\nflowed past. They approached so silently that he did not perceive them, being fully occupied in bathing\nhis feet, which were so fair that they looked like two pieces of shining crystal brought forth among the\nother stones of the brook. The whiteness and beauty of these feet struck them with surprise, for they did\nnot seem to have been made to crush clods or to follow the plough and the oxen as their owner's dress\nsuggested; and so, finding they had not been noticed, the curate, who was in front, made a sign to the\nother two to conceal themselves behind some fragments of rock that lay there; which they did, observing\nclosely what the youth was about. He had on a loose double-skirted dark brown jacket bound tight to his\nbody with a white cloth; he wore besides breeches and gaiters of brown cloth, and on his head a brown\ncap; and he had the gaiters turned up as far as the middle of the leg, which verily seemed to be of pure\nalabaster.\nAs soon as he had done bathing his beautiful feet, he wiped them with a towel he took from under the\nmontera, on taking off which he raised his face, and those who were watching him had an opportunity of\nseeing a beauty so exquisite that Cardenio said to the curate in a whisper:\n\"As this is not Luscinda, it is no human creature but a divine being.\"\nThe youth then took off the cap, and shaking his head from side to side there broke loose and spread out a\nmass of hair that the beams of the sun might have envied; by this they knew that what had seemed a\npeasant was a lovely woman, nay the most beautiful the eyes of two of them had ever beheld, or even\nCardenio's if they had not seen and known Luscinda, for he afterwards declared that only the beauty of\nLuscinda could compare with this. The long auburn tresses not only covered her shoulders, but such was\ntheir length and abundance, concealed her all round beneath their masses, so that except the feet nothing\nof her form was visible. She now used her hands as a comb, and if her feet had seemed like bits of crystal\nin the water, her hands looked like pieces of driven snow among her locks; all which increased not only\nthe admiration of the three beholders, but their anxiety to learn who she was. With this object they\nresolved to show themselves, and at the stir they made in getting upon their feet the fair damsel raised her\nhead, and parting her hair from before her eyes with both hands, she looked to see who had made the\nnoise, and the instant she perceived them she started to her feet, and without waiting to put on her shoes\nor gather up her hair, hastily snatched up a bundle as though of clothes that she had beside her, and,\nscared and alarmed, endeavoured to take flight; but before she had gone six paces she fell to the ground,\nher delicate feet being unable to bear the roughness of the stones; seeing which, the three hastened\ntowards her, and the curate addressing her first said:\n\"Stay, senora, whoever you may be, for those whom you see here only desire to be of service to you; you\nhave no need to attempt a flight so heedless, for neither can your feet bear it, nor we allow it.\"\nTaken by surprise and bewildered, she made no reply to these words. They, however, came towards her,\nand the curate taking her hand went on to say:\n\"What your dress would hide, senora, is made known to us by your hair; a clear proof that it can be no\ntrifling cause that has disguised your beauty in a garb so unworthy of it, and sent it into solitudes like\nthese where we have had the good fortune to find you, if not to relieve your distress, at least to offer you\ncomfort; for no distress, so long as life lasts, can be so oppressive or reach such a height as to make the\nsufferer refuse to listen to comfort offered with good intention. And so, senora, or senor, or whatever you\nprefer to be, dismiss the fears that our appearance has caused you and make us acquainted with your good\nor evil fortunes, for from all of us together, or from each one of us, you will receive sympathy in your\ntrouble.\"\nWhile the curate was speaking, the disguised damsel stood as if spell-bound, looking at them without\nopening her lips or uttering a word, just like a village rustic to whom something strange that he has never\n-103\n\nseen before has been suddenly shown; but on the curate addressing some further words to the same effect\nto her, sighing deeply she broke silence and said:\n\"Since the solitude of these mountains has been unable to conceal me, and the escape of my dishevelled\ntresses will not allow my tongue to deal in falsehoods, it would be idle for me to disguise my words. This\nbeing so, I thank you, sirs, for the offer you have made me, which places me under the obligation of\ncomplying with the request you have made of me; though I fear the account I shall give you of my\nmisfortunes will excite in you as much concern as compassion, for you will be unable to suggest anything\nto remedy them or any consolation to alleviate them.\"\nAll this the lovely woman delivered without any hesitation, with so much ease and in so sweet a voice\nthat they were not less charmed by her intelligence than by her beauty; without further pressing, first\nmodestly covering her feet and gathering up her hair, she seated herself on a stone with the three placed\naround her, and, after an effort to restrain some tears that came to her eyes, in a clear and steady voice\nbegan her story thus:\n\"In this Andalusia there is a town from which a duke takes a title which makes him one of those that are\ncalled Grandees of Spain. This nobleman has two sons, the elder heir to his dignity and apparently to his\ngood qualities; the younger heir to I know not what, unless it be the treachery of Vellido and the\nfalsehood of Ganelon. My parents are this lord's vassals, lowly in origin, but so wealthy that if birth had\nconferred as much on them as fortune, they would have had nothing left to desire, nor should I have had\nreason to fear trouble like that in which I find myself now; for it may be that my ill fortune came of theirs\nin not having been nobly born. It is true they are not so low that they have any reason to be ashamed of\ntheir condition, but neither are they so high as to remove from my mind the impression that my mishap\ncomes of their humble birth. They are, in short, peasants, plain homely people, without any taint of\ndisreputable blood, and, as the saying is, old rusty Christians, but so rich that by their wealth and\nfree-handed way of life they are coming by degrees to be considered gentlefolk by birth, and even by\nposition; though the wealth and nobility they thought most of was having me for their daughter; and as\nthey have no other child to make their heir, and are affectionate parents, I was one of the most indulged\ndaughters that ever parents indulged.\n\"I was the mirror in which they beheld themselves, the staff of their old age, and the object in which, with\nsubmission to Heaven, all their wishes centred, and mine were in accordance with theirs, for I knew their\nworth; and as I was mistress of their hearts, so was I also of their possessions. Through me they engaged\nor dismissed their servants; through my hands passed the accounts and returns of what was sown and\nreaped; the oil-mills, the wine-presses, the count of the flocks and herds, the beehives, all in short that a\nrich farmer like my father has or can have, I had under my care, and I acted as steward and mistress with\nan assiduity on my part and satisfaction on theirs that I cannot well describe to you. The leisure hours left\nto me after I had given the requisite orders to the head-shepherds, overseers, and other labourers, I passed\nin such employments as are not only allowable but necessary for young girls, those that the needle,\nembroidery cushion, and spinning wheel usually afford, and if to refresh my mind I quitted them for a\nwhile, I found recreation in reading some devotional book or playing the harp, for experience taught me\nthat music soothes the troubled mind and relieves weariness of spirit. Such was the life I led in my\nparents' house and if I have depicted it thus minutely, it is not out of ostentation, or to let you know that I\nam rich, but that you may see how, without any fault of mine, I have fallen from the happy condition I\nhave described, to the misery I am in at present. The truth is, that while I was leading this busy life, in a\nretirement that might compare with that of a monastery, and unseen as I thought by any except the\nservants of the house (for when I went to Mass it was so early in the morning, and I was so closely\nattended by my mother and the women of the household, and so thickly veiled and so shy, that my eyes\nscarcely saw more ground than I trod on), in spite of all this, the eyes of love, or idleness, more properly\nspeaking, that the lynx's cannot rival, discovered me, with the help of the assiduity of Don Fernando; for\n-104\n\nthat is the name of the younger son of the duke I told of.\"\nThe moment the speaker mentioned the name of Don Fernando, Cardenio changed colour and broke into\na sweat, with such signs of emotion that the curate and the barber, who observed it, feared that one of the\nmad fits which they heard attacked him sometimes was coming upon him; but Cardenio showed no\nfurther agitation and remained quiet, regarding the peasant girl with fixed attention, for he began to\nsuspect who she was. She, however, without noticing the excitement of Cardenio, continuing her story,\nwent on to say:\n\"No sooner had he seen me than, as he owned afterwards, he was smitten with a violent love for me, as\nthe manner in which it displayed itself plainly showed. But to shorten the long recital of my woes, I will\npass over in silence all the artifices employed by Don Fernando for declaring his passion for me. He\nbribed all the household, he gave and offered gifts and presents to my parents; every day was like a\nholiday or a merry-making in our street; by night no one could sleep for the music; the love letters that\nused to come to my hand, no one knew how, were innumerable, full of tender pleadings and pledges,\ncontaining more promises and oaths than there were letters in them; all which not only did not soften me,\nbut hardened my heart against him, as if he had been my mortal enemy, and as if everything he did to\nmake me yield were done with the opposite intention. Not that the high-bred bearing of Don Fernando\nwas disagreeable to me, or that I found his importunities wearisome; for it gave me a certain sort of\nsatisfaction to find myself so sought and prized by a gentleman of such distinction, and I was not\ndispleased at seeing my praises in his letters (for however ugly we women may be, it seems to me it\nalways pleases us to hear ourselves called beautiful) but that my own sense of right was opposed to all\nthis, as well as the repeated advice of my parents, who now very plainly perceived Don Fernando's\npurpose, for he cared very little if all the world knew it. They told me they trusted and confided their\nhonour and good name to my virtue and rectitude alone, and bade me consider the disparity between Don\nFernando and myself, from which I might conclude that his intentions, whatever he might say to the\ncontrary, had for their aim his own pleasure rather than my advantage; and if I were at all desirous of\nopposing an obstacle to his unreasonable suit, they were ready, they said, to marry me at once to anyone I\npreferred, either among the leading people of our own town, or of any of those in the neighbourhood; for\nwith their wealth and my good name, a match might be looked for in any quarter. This offer, and their\nsound advice strengthened my resolution, and I never gave Don Fernando a word in reply that could hold\nout to him any hope of success, however remote.\n\"All this caution of mine, which he must have taken for coyness, had apparently the effect of increasing\nhis wanton appetite--for that is the name I give to his passion for me; had it been what he declared it to be,\nyou would not know of it now, because there would have been no occasion to tell you of it. At length he\nlearned that my parents were contemplating marriage for me, this intelligence or suspicion made him act\nas you shall hear. One night, as I was in my chamber with no other companion than a damsel who waited\non me, with the doors carefully locked lest my honour should be imperilled through any carelessness, I\nknow not nor can conceive how it happened, but, with all this seclusion and these precautions, and in the\nsolitude and silence of my retirement, I found him standing before me, a vision that so astounded me that\nit deprived my eyes of sight, and my tongue of speech. I had no power to utter a cry, nor, I think, did he\ngive me time to utter one, as he immediately approached me, and taking me in his arms (for,\noverwhelmed as I was, I was powerless, I say, to help myself), he began to make such professions to me\nthat I know not how falsehood could have had the power of dressing them up to seem so like truth; and\nthe traitor contrived that his tears should vouch for his words, and his sighs for his sincerity.\n\"I, a poor young creature alone, ill versed among my people in cases such as this, began, I know not how,\nto think all these lying protestations true, though without being moved by his sighs and tears to anything\nmore than pure compassion; and so, as the first feeling of bewilderment passed away, and I began in some\ndegree to recover myself, I said to him with more courage than I thought I could have possessed, 'If my\n-105\n\nlife depended upon the sacrifice of my honor, it would not be in my power to do it; so then, if you hold\nmy body clasped in your arms, I hold my soul secured by virtuous intentions, very different from yours,\nas you will see if you attempt to carry them into effect by force. I am your vassal, but I am not your slave;\nyour nobility neither has nor should have any right to dishonour or degrade my humble birth; and\nlow-born peasant as I am, I have my self-respect as much as you, a lord and gentleman: with me your\nviolence will be to no purpose, your wealth will have no weight, your words will have no power to\ndeceive me, nor your sighs or tears to soften me: only when my parents give me to a husband will his\nwishes be mine as well; and this I say lest you should suppose that any but my lawful husband shall ever\nwin anything of me.' 'If that,' said this disloyal gentleman, 'be the only scruple you feel, fairest\nDorothea' (for that is the name of this unhappy being), 'see here I give you my hand to be yours, and let\nHeaven, from which nothing is hid, and this image of Our Lady you have here, be witnesses of this\npledge.'\"\n\"Then Don Fernando, taking an image that stood in the chamber, placed it as a witness of our betrothal,\nand with the most binding words and extravagant oaths gave me his promise to become my husband;\nthough before he had made an end of pledging himself I bade him consider well what he was doing, and\nthink of the anger his father would feel at seeing him married to a peasant girl and one of his vassals; I\ntold him not to let my beauty, such as it was, blind him, for that was not enough to furnish an excuse for\nhis transgression; and if in the love he bore me he wished to do me any kindness, it would be to leave my\nlot to follow its course at the level my condition required; for marriages so unequal never brought\nhappiness, nor do they continue long to afford the enjoyment they began with.\n\"All this that I have now repeated I said to him, and much more which I cannot recollect; but it had no\neffect in inducing him to forego his purpose; he who has no intention of paying does not trouble himself\nabout difficulties when he is striking the bargain. At the same time I argued the matter briefly in my own\nmind, saying to myself, 'I shall not be the first who has risen through marriage from a lowly to a lofty\nstation, nor will Don Fernando be the first whom beauty or, as is more likely, a blind attachment, has led\nto mate himself below his rank. Then, since I am introducing no new usage or practice, I may as well\navail myself of the honour that chance offers me, for even though his inclination for me should not outlast\nthe attainment of his wishes, I shall be, after all, his wife before God. And if I strive to repel him by scorn,\nI can see that, fair means failing, he is in a mood to use force, and I shall be left dishonoured and without\nany means of proving my innocence to those who cannot know how innocently I have come to be in this\nposition; for what arguments would persuade my parents that this gentleman entered my chamber without\nmy consent?'\n\"The day which followed the night of my misfortune did not come so quickly, I imagine, as Don\nFernando wished, for when desire has attained its object, the greatest pleasure is to fly from the scene of\npleasure. I say so because Don Fernando made all haste to leave me; but on taking leave of me, he drew a\nrich ring off his finger and placed it upon mine. I told Don Fernando at parting, that as I was now his, he\nmight see me on other nights in the same way, until it should be his pleasure to let the matter become\nknown; but, except the following night, he came no more, nor for more than a month could I catch a\nglimpse of him in the street or in church, while I wearied myself with watching for one; although I knew\nhe was in the town. I remember well how I began to doubt, and how I was forced to constrain my tears,\nnot to give my parents cause to ask me why I was so melancholy and drive me to invent falsehoods in\nreply. But all this was suddenly brought to an end, for a few days later it was reported in the town that\nDon Fernando had been married in a neighbouring city to a maiden of rare beauty, the daughter of parents\nof distinguished position, though not so rich that her portion would entitle her to look for so brilliant a\nmatch; it was said, too, that her name was Luscinda, and that at the betrothal some strange things had\nhappened.\"\nCardenio heard the name of Luscinda, but he only shrugged his shoulders, bit his lips, bent his brows, and\n-106\n\nbefore long two streams of tears escaped from his eyes. Dorothea, however, did not interrupt her story,\nbut went on in these words: \"This sad news reached my ears, I assumed this dress, which I got from a\nservant of my father's to whom I confided the whole of my misfortune, and whom I entreated to\naccompany me to the city where I heard my enemy was. I sallied forth from the house secretly at night,\naccompanied by my servant and reached my destination in two days and a half. On inquiring for the\nhouse of Luscinda's parents, the first person I asked told me all that had occurred at the betrothal of the\ndaughter of the family. He said that on the night of Don Fernando's betrothal with Luscinda, as soon as\nshe had consented to be his bride by saying 'Yes,' she was taken with a sudden fainting fit, and that on\nthe bridegroom approaching to unlace the bosom of her dress to give her air, he found a paper in her own\nhandwriting, in which she said and declared that she could not be Don Fernando's bride, because she was\nalready Cardenio's, who, according to the man's account, was a gentleman of distinction of the same city;\nand that if she had accepted Don Fernando, it was only in obedience to her parents. he said that the words\nof the paper made it clear she meant to kill herself on the completion of the betrothal, which was\nconfirmed by a dagger they found somewhere in her clothes. On seeing this, Don Fernando, seeing that\nLuscinda fooled and slighted him, assailed her before she had recovered from her swoon, and tried to stab\nher with the dagger that had been found, and would have succeeded had not her parents and those who\nwere present prevented him. It was said, moreover, that Don Fernando went away at once, and that\nLuscinda did not recover from her prostration until the next day, when she told her parents how she was\nreally the bride of that Cardenio I have mentioned. I learned besides that Cardenio, according to report,\nhad been present at the betrothal; and that upon seeing her betrothed contrary to his expectation, he had\nfled the city in despair, leaving behind him a letter declaring the wrong Luscinda had done him and his\nintention of going where no one should ever see him again. All this was a matter of notoriety in the city,\nand everyone spoke of it; especially when it became known that Luscinda was missing from her father's\nhouse and from the city, for she was not to be found anywhere, to the distraction of her parents, who\nknew not what steps to take to recover her. What I learned revived my hopes, and I was better pleased not\nto have found Don Fernando than to find him married, for it seemed to me that the door was not yet\nentirely shut upon relief in my case. But while I was in the city, uncertain what to do, I heard notice given\nby the public crier offering a great reward from my parents to anyone who should find me, showing how\nlow my good name had fallen. The instant I heard the notice I quitted the city with my servant, who now\nbegan to show signs of wavering in his fidelity to me, and the same night, for fear of discovery, we\nentered the most thickly wooded part of these mountains. But, as is commonly said, one evil calls up\nanother and the end of one misfortune is apt to be the beginning of one still greater, and so it proved in\nmy case; for my worthy servant, until then so faithful and trusty when he found me in this lonely spot,\nsought to take advantage of the opportunity which these solitudes seemed to present him; and finding that\nI replied to his proposals with justly severe language, he laid aside the entreaties which he had employed\nat first, and began to use violence.\n\"But just Heaven, that seldom fails to watch over and aid good intentions, so aided mine that with my\nslight strength and with little exertion I pushed him over a precipice, where I left him, whether dead or\nalive I know not; and then, with greater speed than seemed possible in my terror and fatigue, I made my\nway into the mountains, without any other thought or purpose save that of hiding myself among them,\nand escaping my father and those despatched in search of me by his orders. It is now I know not how\nmany months since with this object I came here, where I met a herdsman who engaged me as his servant\nat a place in the heart of this Sierra, and all this time I have been serving him as herd, striving to keep\nalways afield to hide these locks which have now unexpectedly betrayed me. But all my care and pains\nwere unavailing, for my master made the discovery that I was not a man, and harboured the same base\ndesigns as my servant; and I thought it a lesser evil to leave him and again conceal myself among these\ncrags, than make trial of my strength and argument with him. So, as I say, once more I went into hiding to\nseek for some place where I might with sighs and tears implore Heaven to have pity on my misery, and\ngrant me help and strength to escape from it, or let me die among the solitudes, leaving no trace of an\nunhappy being who, by no fault of hers, has furnished matter for talk and scandal at home and abroad.\"\n-107\n\nCHAPTER XXIX.\nWHICH TREATS OF THE DROLL DEVICE AND METHOD ADOPTED TO EXTRICATE OUR\nLOVE-STRICKEN KNIGHT FROM THE SEVERE PENANCE HE HAD IMPOSED UPON HIMSELF\nWith these words she became silent, and the colour that overspread her face showed plainly the pain and\nshame she was suffering at heart. In theirs the listeners felt as much pity as wonder at her misfortunes; but\nas the curate was just about to offer her some consolation and advice Cardenio forestalled him, saying,\n\"So then, senora, you are the fair Dorothea, the only daughter of the rich Clenardo?\" Dorothea was\nastonished at hearing her father's name, and at the miserable appearance of him who mentioned it, for it\nhas been already said how wretchedly clad Cardenio was; so she said to him: \"And who may you be,\nbrother, who seem to know my father's name so well? For so far, if I remember rightly, I have not\nmentioned it in the whole story of my misfortunes.\"\n\"I am that unhappy being, senora,\" replied Cardenio, \"whom, as you have said, Luscinda declared to be\nher husband; I am the unfortunate Cardenio, whom the wrong-doing of him who has brought you to your\npresent condition has reduced to the state you see me in, bare, ragged, bereft of all human comfort, and\nwhat is worse, of reason, for I only possess it when Heaven is pleased for some short space to restore it to\nme. But it may be that Heaven has yet in store for both of us a happier termination to our misfortunes\nthan we look for; because seeing that Luscinda cannot marry Don Fernando, being mine, as she has\nherself so openly declared, and that Don Fernando cannot marry her as he is yours, we may reasonably\nhope that Heaven will restore to us what is ours; for I swear to you by the faith of a gentleman and a\nChristian not to desert you until I see you in possession of Don Fernando.\"\nCardenio's words completed the astonishment of Dorothea, and not knowing how to return thanks for\nsuch an offer, she attempted to kiss his feet; but Cardenio would not permit it, and the curate replied for\nboth, commended the sound reasoning of Cardenio, and lastly, begged, advised, and urged them to come\nwith him to his village, where they might furnish themselves with what they needed, and take measures to\ndiscover Don Fernando, or restore Dorothea to her parents, or do what seemed to them most advisable.\nCardenio and Dorothea thanked him, and accepted the kind offer he made them; and the barber, who had\nbeen listening to all attentively and in silence, on his part some kindly words also, and with no less\ngood-will than the curate offered his services in any way that might be of use to them. He also explained\nto them in a few words the object that had brought them there, and the strange nature of Don Quixote's\nmadness, and how they were waiting for his squire, who had gone in search of him. Like the recollection\nof a dream, the quarrel he had had with Don Quixote came back to Cardenio's memory, and he described\nit to the others; but he was unable to say what the dispute was about.\nAt this moment they heard a shout, and recognised it as coming from Sancho Panza, who, not finding\nthem where he had left them, was calling aloud to them. They went to meet him, and in answer to their\ninquiries about Don Quixote, he told them how he had found him stripped to his shirt, lank, yellow, half\ndead with hunger, and sighing for his lady Dulcinea; and although he had told him that she commanded\nhim to quit that place and come to El Toboso, where she was expecting him, he had answered that he was\ndetermined not to appear in the presence of her beauty until he had done deeds to make him worthy of her\nfavour; and if this went on, Sancho said, he ran the risk of not becoming an emperor as in duty bound, or\neven an archbishop, which was the least he could be; for which reason they ought to consider what was to\nbe done to get him away from there. The curate in reply told him not to be uneasy, for they would fetch\nhim away in spite of himself. He then told Cardenio and Dorothea what they had proposed to do to cure\nDon Quixote, or at any rate take him home; upon which Dorothea said that she could play the distressed\ndamsel better than the barber; especially as she had there the dress in which to do it to the life, and that\nthey might trust to her acting the part in every particular requisite for carrying out their scheme, for she\nhad read a great many books of chivalry, and knew exactly the style in which afflicted damsels begged\n-108\n\ntheir boons of knights-errant.\n\"In that case,\" said the curate, \"there is nothing more required than to set about it at once, for beyond a\ndoubt fortune is declaring itself in our favour, since it has so unexpectedly begun to open a door for your\nrelief, and smoothed the way for us to our object.\"\nDorothea then took out of her pillow-case a complete petticoat of some rich stuff, and a green mantle of\nsome other fine material, and a necklace and other ornaments out of a little box, and with these in an\ninstant she so arrayed herself that she looked like a great and rich lady. All this, and more, she said, she\nhad taken from home in case of need, but that until then she had had no occasion to make use of it. They\nwere all highly delighted with her grace, air, and beauty, and declared Don Fernando to be a man of very\nlittle taste when he rejected such charms. But the one who admired her most was Sancho Panza, for it\nseemed to him (what indeed was true) that in all the days of his life he had never seen such a lovely\ncreature; and he asked the curate with great eagerness who this beautiful lady was, and what she wanted\nin these out-of-the-way places.\n\"This fair lady, brother Sancho,\" replied the curate, \"is no less a personage than the heiress in the direct\nmale line of the great kingdom of Micomicon, who has come in search of your master to beg a boon of\nhim, which is that he redress a wrong or injury that a wicked giant has done her; and from the fame as a\ngood knight which your master has acquired far and wide, this princess has come from Guinea to seek\nhim.\"\n\"A lucky seeking and a lucky finding!\" said Sancho Panza; \"especially if my master has the good fortune\nto redress that injury, and right that wrong, and kill that son of a bitch of a giant your worship speaks of;\nas kill him he will if he meets him, unless, indeed, he happens to be a phantom; for my master has no\npower at all against phantoms. But one thing among others I would beg of you, senor curate, which is,\nthat, to prevent my master taking a fancy to be an archbishop, for that is what I'm afraid of, your worship\nwould recommend him to marry this princess at once; for in this way he will be disabled from taking\narchbishop's orders, and will easily come into his empire, and I to the end of my desires; I have been\nthinking over the matter carefully, and by what I can make out I find it will not do for me that my master\nshould become an archbishop, because I am no good for the Church, as I am married; and for me now,\nhaving as I have a wife and children, to set about obtaining dispensations to enable me to hold a place of\nprofit under the Church, would be endless work; so that, senor, it all turns on my master marrying this\nlady at once--for as yet I do not know her grace, and so I cannot call her by her name.\"\n\"She is called the Princess Micomicona,\" said the curate; \"for as her kingdom is Micomicon, it is clear\nthat must be her name, and as for your master's marrying, I will do all in my power towards it.\" Sancho\nwas as much pleased with this answer as the curate was amazed at his simplicity and at seeing what a hold\nthe absurdities of his master had taken of his fancy. By this time Dorothea had seated herself upon the\ncurate's mule, and the barber had fitted the ox-tail beard to his face, and they now told Sancho to conduct\nthem to where Don Quixote was, warning him not to say that he knew either the curate or the barber, as\nhis master's becoming an emperor entirely depended on his not recognising them; neither the curate nor\nCardenio, however, thought fit to go with them; Cardenio lest he should remind Don Quixote of the\nquarrel he had with him, and the curate as there was no necessity for his presence just yet, so they allowed\nthe others to go on before them, while they themselves followed slowly on foot.\nThey had gone about three-quarters of a league when they discovered Don Quixote in a wilderness of\nrocks, by this time clothed, but without his armour; and as soon as Dorothea saw him and was told by\nSancho that that was Don Quixote, she whipped her palfrey, the well-bearded barber following her, and\non coming up to him her squire sprang from his mule and came forward to receive her in his arms, and\nshe dismounting with great ease of manner advanced to kneel before the feet of Don Quixote; and though\n-109\n\nhe strove to raise her up, she without rising addressed him in this fashion: \"From this spot I will not rise,\nvaliant and doughty knight, until your goodness and courtesy grant me a boon, which will redound to the\nhonour and renown of your person and render a service to the most disconsolate and afflicted damsel the\nsun has seen; and if the might of your strong arm corresponds to the repute of your immortal fame, you\nare bound to aid the helpless being who, led by the savour of your renowned name, hath come from far\ndistant lands to seek your aid in her misfortunes.\"\n\"I will not answer a word, beauteous lady,\" replied Don Quixote, \"nor will I listen to anything further\nconcerning you, until you rise from the earth.\"\n\"I will not rise, senor,\" answered the afflicted damsel, \"unless of your courtesy the boon I ask is first\ngranted me.\"\n\"I grant and accord it,\" said Don Quixote, \"provided without detriment or prejudice to my king, my\ncountry, or her who holds the key of my heart and freedom, it may be complied with.\"\n\"It will not be to the detriment or prejudice of any of them, my worthy lord,\" said the afflicted damsel;\nand here Sancho Panza drew close to his master's ear and said to him very softly, \"Your worship may\nvery safely grant the boon she asks; it's nothing at all; only to kill a big giant; and she who asks it is the\nexalted Princess Micomicona, queen of the great kingdom of Micomicon of Ethiopia.\"\n\"Let her be who she may,\" replied Don Quixote, \"I will do what is my bounden duty, and what my\nconscience bids me, in conformity with what I have professed;\" and turning to the damsel he said, \"Let\nyour great beauty rise, for I grant the boon which you would ask of me.\"\n\"Then what I ask,\" said the damsel, \"is that your magnanimous person accompany me at once whither I\nwill conduct you, and that you promise not to engage in any other adventure or quest until you have\navenged me of a traitor who against all human and divine law, has usurped my kingdom.\"\n\"I repeat that I grant it,\" replied Don Quixote; \"and so, lady, you may from this day forth lay aside the\nmelancholy that distresses you, and let your failing hopes gather new life and strength, for with the help\nof God and of my arm you will soon see yourself restored to your kingdom, and seated upon the throne of\nyour ancient and mighty realm, notwithstanding and despite of the felons who would gainsay it; and now\nhands to the work, for in delay there is apt to be danger.\"\nThe distressed damsel strove with much pertinacity to kiss his hands; but Don Quixote, who was in all\nthings a polished and courteous knight, would by no means allow it, but made her rise and embraced her\nwith great courtesy and politeness, and ordered Sancho to look to Rocinante's girths, and to arm him\nwithout a moment's delay. Sancho took down the armour, which was hung up on a tree like a trophy, and\nhaving seen to the girths armed his master in a trice, who as soon as he found himself in his armour\nexclaimed: \"Let us be gone in the name of God to bring aid to this great lady.\"\nThe barber was all this time on his knees at great pains to hide his laughter and not let his beard fall, for\nhad it fallen maybe their fine scheme would have come to nothing; but now seeing the boon granted, and\nthe promptitude with which Don Quixote prepared to set out in compliance with it, he rose and took his\nlady's hand, and between them they placed her upon the mule. Don Quixote then mounted Rocinante, and\nthe barber settled himself on his beast, Sancho being left to go on foot, which made him feel anew the loss\nof his Dapple, finding the want of him now. But he bore all with cheerfulness, being persuaded that his\nmaster had now fairly started and was just on the point of becoming an emperor; for he felt no doubt at all\nthat he would marry this princess, and be king of Micomicon at least. And so he jogged on, so occupied\nwith his thoughts and easy in his mind that he forgot all about the hardship of travelling on foot.\n-110\n\nCardenio and the curate were watching all this from among some bushes, not knowing how to join\ncompany with the others; but the curate, who was very fertile in devices, soon hit upon a way of effecting\ntheir purpose, and with a pair of scissors he had in a case he quickly cut off Cardenio's beard, and putting\non him a grey jerkin of his own he gave him a black cloak, leaving himself in his breeches and doublet,\nwhile Cardenio's appearance was so different from what it had been that he would not have known\nhimself had he seen himself in a mirror. While they were disguising themselves, the others had gone a\ngood way ahead, but they easily reached the highroad before them becaukse the thickets and broken paths\ndid not all those on horseback to travel as fast as those on foot. When they caught up with Don Quixote\nand his party, the curate began to examine him very deliberately, as though he were striving to recognise\nhim, and after having stared at him for some time he hastened towards him with open arms exclaiming,\n\"A happy meeting with the mirror of chivalry, my worthy compatriot Don Quixote of La Mancha, the\nflower and cream of high breeding, the protection and relief of the distressed, the quintessence of\nknights-errant!\" And so saying he clasped in his arms the knee of Don Quixote's left leg. He, astonished\nat the stranger's words and behaviour, looked at him attentively, and at length recognised him, very much\nsurprised to see him there, and made great efforts to dismount. This, however, the curate would not allow,\non which Don Quixote said, \"Permit me, senor curate, for it is not fitting that I should be on horseback\nand so reverend a person as your worship on foot.\"\n\"On no account will I allow it,\" said the curate; \"your mightiness must remain on horseback, for it is on\nhorseback you achieve the greatest deeds and adventures that have been beheld in our age; as for me, an\nunworthy priest, it will serve me well enough to mount on the haunches of one of the mules of these\ngentlefolk who accompany your worship, if they have no objection, and I will fancy I am mounted on the\nsteed Pegasus, or on the zebra or charger that bore the famous Moor, Muzaraque, who to this day lies\nenchanted in the great hill of Zulema, a little distance from the great Complutum.\"\n\"Nor even that will I consent to, senor curate,\" answered Don Quixote, \"and I know it will be the good\npleasure of my lady the princess, out of love for me, to order her squire to give up the saddle of his mule\nto your worship, and he can sit behind if the beast will bear it.\"\n\"It will, I am sure,\" said the princess, \"and I am sure, too, that I need not order my squire, for he is too\ncourteous and considerate to allow a Churchman to go on foot when he might be mounted.\"\n\"That he is,\" said the barber, and at once alighting, he offered his saddle to the curate, who accepted it\nwithout much entreaty; but unfortunately as the barber was mounting behind, the mule, being as it\nhappened a hired one, which is the same thing as saying ill-conditioned, lifted its hind hoofs and let fly a\ncouple of kicks in the air, which would have made Master Nicholas wish his expedition in quest of Don\nQuixote at the devil had they caught him on the breast or head. As it was, they so took him by surprise\nthat he came to the ground, giving so little heed to his beard that it fell off, and all he could do when he\nfound himself without it was to cover his face hastily with both his hands and moan that his teeth were\nknocked out. Don Quixote when he saw all that bundle of beard detached, without jaws or blood, from the\nface of the fallen squire, exclaimed:\n\"By the living God, but this is a great miracle! it has knocked off and plucked away the beard from his\nface as if it had been shaved off designedly.\"\nThe curate, seeing the danger of discovery that threatened his scheme, at once pounced upon the beard\nand hastened with it to where Master Nicholas lay, still uttering moans, and drawing his head to his breast\nhad it on in an instant, muttering over him some words which he said were a certain special charm for\nsticking on beards, as they would see; and as soon as he had it fixed he left him, and the squire appeared\nwell bearded and whole as before, whereat Don Quixote was beyond measure astonished, and begged the\ncurate to teach him that charm when he had an opportunity, as he was persuaded its virtue must extend\n-111\n\nbeyond the sticking on of beards, for it was clear that where the beard had been stripped off the flesh must\nhave remained torn and lacerated, and what could heal all that must be good for more than beards.\n\"And so it is,\" said the curate, and he promised to teach it to him on the first opportunity. They then\nagreed that for the present the curate should mount, and that the three should ride by turns until they\nreached the inn, which might be about six leagues from where they were.\nThree then being mounted, that is to say, Don Quixote, the princess, and the curate, and three on foot,\nCardenio, the barber, and Sancho Panza, Don Quixote said to the damsel:\n\"Let your highness, lady, lead on whithersoever is most pleasing to you;\" but before she could answer the\ncurate said:\n\"Towards what kingdom would your ladyship direct our course? Is it perchance towards that of\nMicomicon? It must be, or else I know little about kingdoms.\"\nShe, being ready on all points, understood that she was to answer \"Yes,\" so she said \"Yes, senor, my way\nlies towards that kingdom.\"\n\"In that case,\" said the curate, \"we must pass right through my village, and there your worship will take\nthe road to Cartagena, where you will be able to embark, fortune favouring; and if the wind be fair and\nthe sea smooth and tranquil, in somewhat less than nine years you may come in sight of the great lake\nMeona, I mean Meotides, which is little more than a hundred days' journey this side of your highness's\nkingdom.\"\n\"Your worship is mistaken, senor,\" said she; \"for it is not two years since I set out from it, and though I\nnever had good weather, nevertheless I am here to behold what I so longed for, and that is my lord Don\nQuixote of La Mancha, whose fame came to my ears as soon as I set foot in Spain and impelled me to go\nin search of him, to commend myself to his courtesy, and entrust the justice of my cause to the might of\nhis invincible arm.\"\n\"Enough; no more praise,\" said Don Quixote at this, \"for I hate all flattery; and though this may not be so,\nstill language of the kind is offensive to my chaste ears. I will only say, senora, that whether it has might\nor not, that which it may or may not have shall be devoted to your service even to death; and now, leaving\nthis to its proper season, I would ask the senor curate to tell me what it is that has brought him into these\nparts, alone, unattended, and so lightly clad that I am filled with amazement.\"\n\"I will answer that briefly,\" replied the curate; \"you must know then, Senor Don Quixote, that Master\nNicholas, our friend and barber, and I were going to Seville to receive some money that a relative of mine\nwho went to the Indies many years ago had sent me, and not such a small sum but that it was over sixty\nthousand pieces of eight, full weight, which is something; and passing by this place yesterday we were\nattacked by four footpads, who stripped us even to our beards, and them they stripped off so that the\nbarber found it necessary to put on a false one, and even this young man here\"-pointing to\nCardenio--\"they completely transformed. But the best of it is, the story goes in the neighbourhood that\nthose who attacked us belong to a number of galley slaves who, they say, were set free almost on the very\nsame spot by a man of such valour that, in spite of the commissary and of the guards, he released the\nwhole of them; and beyond all doubt he must have been out of his senses, or he must be as great a\nscoundrel as they, or some man without heart or conscience to let the wolf loose among the sheep, the fox\namong the hens, the fly among the honey. He has defrauded justice, and opposed his king and lawful\nmaster, for he opposed his just commands; he has, I say, robbed the galleys of their feet, stirred up the\nHoly Brotherhood which for many years past has been quiet, and, lastly, has done a deed by which his\n-112\n\nsoul may be lost without any gain to his body.\" Sancho had told the curate and the barber of the adventure\nof the galley slaves, which, so much to his glory, his master had achieved, and hence the curate in\nalluding to it made the most of it to see what would be said or done by Don Quixote; who changed colour\nat every word, not daring to say that it was he who had been the liberator of those worthy people. \"These,\nthen,\" said the curate, \"were they who robbed us; and God in his mercy pardon him who would not let\nthem go to the punishment they deserved.\"\nCHAPTER XXX.\nWHICH TREATS OF ADDRESS DISPLAYED BY THE FAIR DOROTHEA, WITH OTHER\nMATTERS PLEASANT AND AMUSING\nThe curate had hardly ceased speaking, when Sancho said, \"In faith, then, senor curate, he who did that\ndeed was my master; and it was not for want of my telling him beforehand and warning him to mind what\nhe was about, and that it was a sin to set them at liberty, as they were all on the march there because they\nwere special scoundrels.\"\n\"Blockhead!\" said Don Quixote at this, \"it is no business or concern of knights-errant to inquire whether\nany persons in affliction, in chains, or oppressed that they may meet on the high roads go that way and\nsuffer as they do because of their faults or because of their misfortunes. It only concerns them to aid them\nas persons in need of help, having regard to their sufferings and not to their rascalities. I encountered a\nchaplet or string of miserable and unfortunate people, and did for them what my religion demands of me,\nand as for the rest be that as it may; and whoever takes objection to it, saving the sacred dignity of the\nsenor curate and his honoured person, I say he knows little about chivalry and lies like a whoreson villain,\nand this I will give him to know to the fullest extent with my sword;\" and so saying he settled himself in\nhis stirrups and pressed down his morion; for the barber's basin, which according to him was Mambrino's\nhelmet, he carried hanging at the saddle-bow until he could repair the damage done to it by the galley\nslaves.\nDorothea by this time thoroughly understanding Don Quixote's crazy turn and seeing that all except\nSancho Panza were making game of him, observed his irritation and said, \"Sir Knight, remember the\nboon you have promised me, and that in accordance with it you must not engage in any other adventure,\nbe it ever so pressing; calm yourself, for if the curate had known that the galley slaves had been set free\nby that unconquered arm he would have stopped his mouth thrice over, or even bitten his tongue three\ntimes before he would have said a word that tended towards disrespect of your worship.\"\n\"That I swear heartily,\" said the curate, \"and I would have even plucked off a moustache.\"\n\"I will hold my peace, senora,\" said Don Quixote, \"and I will curb the natural anger that had arisen in my\nbreast, and will proceed in peace and quietness until I have fulfilled my promise; but in return for this\nconsideration I entreat you to tell me, if you have no objection to do so, what is the nature of your trouble,\nand how many, who, and what are the persons of whom I am to require due satisfaction, and on whom I\nam to take vengeance on your behalf?\"\n\"That I will do with all my heart,\" replied Dorothea, \"if it will not be wearisome to you to hear of\nmiseries and misfortunes.\"\n\"It will not be wearisome, senora,\" said Don Quixote; to which Dorothea replied, \"Well, if that be so,\ngive me your attention.\" As soon as she said this, Cardenio and the barber drew close to her side, eager to\nhear what sort of story the quick-witted Dorothea would invent; and Sancho did the same, for he was as\nmuch taken in by her as his master; and she having settled herself comfortably in the saddle, and with the\n-113\n\nhelp of coughing and other preliminaries taken time to think, began with great sprightliness of manner in\nthis fashion.\n\"First of all, I would have you know, sirs, that my name is-\" and here she stopped for a moment, for she\nforgot the name the curate had given her; but he came to her relief, seeing what her difficulty was, and\nsaid, \"It is no wonder, senora, that your highness should be confused and embarrassed in telling the tale of\nyour misfortunes; for such afflictions often have the effect of depriving the sufferers of memory, so that\nthey do not even remember their own names, as is the case now with your ladyship, who has forgotten\nthat she is called the Princess Micomicona, lawful heiress of the great kingdom of Micomicon; and with\nthis cue your highness may now recall to your sorrowful recollection all you may wish to tell us.\"\n\"That is the truth,\" said the damsel; \"but I think from this on I shall have no need of any prompting, and I\nshall bring my true story safe into port, and here it is. The king my father, who was called Tinacrio the\nSapient, was very learned in what they call magic arts, and became aware by his craft that my mother,\nwho was called Queen Jaramilla, was to die before he did, and that soon after he too was to depart this\nlife, and I was to be left an orphan without father or mother. But all this, he declared, did not so much\ngrieve or distress him as his certain knowledge that a prodigious giant, the lord of a great island close to\nour kingdom, Pandafilando of the Scowl by name--for it is averred that, though his eyes are properly\nplaced and straight, he always looks askew as if he squinted, and this he does out of malignity, to strike\nfear and terror into those he looks at--that he knew, I say, that this giant on becoming aware of my orphan\ncondition would overrun my kingdom with a mighty force and strip me of all, not leaving me even a\nsmall village to shelter me; but that I could avoid all this ruin and misfortune if I were willing to marry\nhim; however, as far as he could see, he never expected that I would consent to a marriage so unequal;\nand he said no more than the truth in this, for it has never entered my mind to marry that giant, or any\nother, let him be ever so great or enormous. My father said, too, that when he was dead, and I saw\nPandafilando about to invade my kingdom, I was not to wait and attempt to defend myself, for that would\nbe destructive to me, but that I should leave the kingdom entirely open to him if I wished to avoid the\ndeath and total destruction of my good and loyal vassals, for there would be no possibility of defending\nmyself against the giant's devilish power; and that I should at once with some of my followers set out for\nSpain, where I should obtain relief in my distress on finding a certain knight-errant whose fame by that\ntime would extend over the whole kingdom, and who would be called, if I remember rightly, Don Azote\nor Don Gigote.\"\n\"'Don Quixote,' he must have said, senora,\" observed Sancho at this, \"otherwise called the Knight of\nRegretful Appearance.\"\n\"That is it,\" said Dorothea; \"he said, moreover, that he would be tall of stature and lank featured; and that\non his right side under the left shoulder, or thereabouts, he would have a grey mole with hairs like\nbristles.\"\nOn hearing this, Don Quixote said to his squire, \"Here, Sancho my son, bear a hand and help me to strip,\nfor I want to see if I am the knight that sage king foretold.\"\n\"What does your worship want to strip for?\" said Dorothea.\n\"To see if I have that mole your father spoke of,\" answered Don Quixote.\n\"There is no occasion to strip,\" said Sancho; \"for I know your worship has just such a mole on the middle\nof your backbone, which is the mark of a strong man.\"\n\"That is enough,\" said Dorothea, \"for with friends we must not look too closely into trifles; and whether it\n-114\n\nbe on the shoulder or on the backbone matters little; it is enough if there is a mole, be it where it may, for\nit is all the same flesh; no doubt my good father hit the truth in every particular, and I have made a lucky\nhit in commending myself to Don Quixote; for he is the one my father spoke of, as the features of his\ncountenance correspond with those assigned to this knight by that wide fame he has acquired not only in\nSpain but in all La Mancha; for I had scarcely landed at Osuna when I heard such accounts of his\nachievements, that at once my heart told me he was the very one I had come in search of.\"\n\"But how did you land at Osuna, senora,\" asked Don Quixote, \"when it is not a seaport?\"\nBut before Dorothea could reply the curate anticipated her, saying, \"The princess meant to say that after\nshe had landed at Malaga the first place where she heard of your worship was Osuna.\"\n\"That is what I meant to say,\" said Dorothea.\n\"And that would be only natural,\" said the curate. \"Will your majesty please proceed?\"\n\"There is no more to add,\" said Dorothea, \"save that in finding Don Quixote I have had such good\nfortune, that I already reckon and regard myself queen and mistress of my entire dominions, since of his\ncourtesy and magnanimity he has granted me the boon of accompanying me whithersoever I may conduct\nhim, which will be only to bring him face to face with Pandafilando of the Scowl, that he may slay him\nand restore to me what has been unjustly usurped by him: for all this must come to pass satisfactorily\nsince my good father Tinacrio the Sapient foretold it, who likewise left it declared in writing in Chaldee\nor Greek characters (for I cannot read them), that if this predicted knight, after having cut the giant's\nthroat, should be disposed to marry me I was to offer myself at once without demur as his lawful wife,\nand yield him possession of my kingdom together with my person.\"\n\"What thinkest thou now, friend Sancho?\" said Don Quixote at this. \"Hearest thou that? Did I not tell thee\nso? See how we have already got a kingdom to govern and a queen to marry!\"\n\"On my oath it is so,\" said Sancho; \"and foul fortune to him who won't marry after slitting Senor\nPandahilado's windpipe! And then, how ill-favoured the queen is! I wish the fleas in my bed were that\nsort!\"\nAnd so saying he cut a couple of capers in the air with every sign of extreme satisfaction, and then ran to\nseize the bridle of Dorothea's mule, and checking it fell on his knees before her, begging her to give him\nher hand to kiss in token of his acknowledgment of her as his queen and mistress. Which of the\nbystanders could have helped laughing to see the madness of the master and the simplicity of the servant?\nDorothea therefore gave her hand, and promised to make him a great lord in her kingdom, when Heaven\nshould be so good as to permit her to recover and enjoy it, for which Sancho returned thanks in words that\nset them all laughing again.\n\"This, sirs,\" continued Dorothea, \"is my story; it only remains to tell you that of all the attendants I took\nwith me from my kingdom I have none left except this well-bearded squire, for all were drowned in a\ngreat tempest we encountered when in sight of port; and he and I came to land on a couple of planks as if\nby a miracle; and indeed the whole course of my life is a miracle and a mystery as you may have\nobserved; and if I have been over minute in any respect or not as precise as I ought, let it be accounted for\nby what the curate said at the beginning of my tale, that constant and excessive troubles deprive the\nsufferers of their memory.\"\n\"They shall not deprive me of mine, exalted and worthy princess,\" said Don Quixote, \"however great and\nunexampled those which I shall endure in your service may be; and here I confirm anew the boon I have\npromised you, and I swear to go with you to the end of the world until I find myself in the presence of\n-115\n\nyour fierce enemy, whose haughty head I trust by the aid of my arm to cut off with the edge of this--I will\nnot say good sword, thanks to Gines de Pasamonte who carried away mine\"--(this he said between his\nteeth, and then continued), \"and when it has been cut off and you have been put in peaceful possession of\nyour realm it shall be left to your own decision to dispose of your person as may be most pleasing to you;\nfor so long as my memory is occupied, my will enslaved, and my understanding enthralled by her-I say\nno more--it is impossible for me for a moment to contemplate marriage, even with a Phoenix.\"\nThe last words of his master about not wanting to marry were so disagreeable to Sancho that raising his\nvoice he exclaimed with great irritation: \"By my oath, Senor Don Quixote, you are not in your right\nsenses; for how can your worship possibly object to marrying such an exalted princess as this? Do you\nthink Fortune will offer you behind every stone such a piece of luck as is offered you now? Is my lady\nDulcinea fairer, perchance? Not she; nor half as fair; and I will even go so far as to say she does not come\nup to the shoe of this one here. A poor chance I have of getting that county I am waiting for if your\nworship goes looking for dainties in the bottom of the sea. In the devil's name, marry, marry, and take\nthis kingdom that comes to hand without any trouble, and when you are king make me a marquis or\ngovernor of a province, and for the rest let the devil take it all.\"\nDon Quixote, when he heard such blasphemies uttered against his lady Dulcinea, could not endure it, and\nlifting his pike, without saying anything to Sancho or uttering a word, he gave him two such thwacks that\nhe brought him to the ground; and had it not been that Dorothea cried out to him to spare him he would\nhave no doubt taken his life on the spot.\n\"Do you think,\" he said to him after a pause, \"you scurvy clown, that you are to be always interfering\nwith me, and that you are to be always offending and I always pardoning? Don't fancy it, impious\nscoundrel, for that beyond a doubt thou art, since thou hast set thy tongue going against the peerless\nDulcinea. Know you not, lout, vagabond, beggar, that were it not for the might that she infuses into my\narm I should not have strength enough to kill a flea? Say, scoffer with a viper's tongue, what think you\nhas won this kingdom and cut off this giant's head and made you a marquis (for all this I count as already\naccomplished and decided), but the might of Dulcinea, employing my arm as the instrument of her\nachievements? She fights in me and conquers in me, and I live and breathe in her, and owe my life and\nbeing to her. O whoreson scoundrel, how ungrateful you are, you see yourself raised from the dust of the\nearth to be a titled lord, and the return you make for so great a benefit is to speak evil of her who has\nconferred it upon you!\"\nSancho was not so stunned but that he heard all his master said, and rising with some degree of\nnimbleness he ran to place himself behind Dorothea's palfrey, and from that position he said to his\nmaster: \"Tell me, senor; if your worship is resolved not to marry this great princess, it is plain the\nkingdom will not be yours; and not being so, how can you bestow favours upon me? That is what I\ncomplain of. Let your worship at any rate marry this queen, now that we have got her here as if showered\ndown from heaven, and afterwards you may go back to my lady Dulcinea; for there must have been kings\nin the world who kept mistresses. As to beauty, I have nothing to do with it; and if the truth is to be told, I\nlike them both; though I have never seen the lady Dulcinea.\"\n\"How! never seen her, blasphemous traitor!\" exclaimed Don Quixote; \"hast thou not just now brought me\na message from her?\"\n\"I mean,\" said Sancho, \"that I did not see her so much at my leisure that I could take particular notice of\nher beauty, or of her charms piecemeal; but taken in the lump I like her.\"\n\"Now I forgive thee,\" said Don Quixote; \"and do thou forgive me the injury I have done thee; for our first\nimpulses are not in our control.\"\n-116\n\n\"That I see,\" replied Sancho, \"and with me the wish to speak is always the first impulse, and I cannot help\nsaying, once at any rate, what I have on the tip of my tongue.\"\n\"For all that, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"take heed of what thou sayest, for the pitcher goes so often to\nthe well--I need say no more to thee.\"\n\"Well, well,\" said Sancho, \"God is in heaven, and sees all tricks, and will judge who does most harm, I in\nnot speaking right, or your worship in not doing so.\"\n\"That is enough,\" said Dorothea; \"run, Sancho, and kiss your lord's hand and beg his pardon, and\nhenceforward be more circumspect with your praise and abuse; and say nothing in disparagement of that\nlady Toboso, of whom I know nothing save that I am her servant; and put your trust in God, for you will\nnot fail to obtain some dignity so as to live like a prince.\"\nSancho advanced hanging his head and begged his master's hand, which Don Quixote with dignity\npresented to him, giving him his blessing as soon as he had kissed it; he then bade him go on ahead a\nlittle, as he had questions to ask him and matters of great importance to discuss with him. Sancho obeyed,\nand when the two had gone some distance in advance Don Quixote said to him, \"Since thy return I have\nhad no opportunity or time to ask thee many particulars touching thy mission and the answer thou hast\nbrought back, and now that chance has granted us the time and opportunity, deny me not the happiness\nthou canst give me by such good news.\"\n\"Let your worship ask what you will,\" answered Sancho, \"for I shall find a way out of all as as I found a\nway in; but I implore you, senor, not not to be so revengeful in future.\"\n\"Why dost thou say that, Sancho?\" said Don Quixote.\n\"I say it,\" he returned, \"because those blows just now were more because of the quarrel the devil stirred\nup between us both the other night, than for what I said against my lady Dulcinea, whom I love and\nreverence as I would a relic--though there is nothing of that about her--merely as something belonging to\nyour worship.\"\n\"Say no more on that subject for thy life, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"for it is displeasing to me; I have\nalready pardoned thee for that, and thou knowest the common saying, 'for a fresh sin a fresh penance.'\"\nWhile this was going on they saw coming along the road they were following a man mounted on an ass,\nwho when he came close seemed to be a gipsy; but Sancho Panza, whose eyes and heart were there\nwherever he saw asses, no sooner beheld the man than he knew him to be Gines de Pasamonte; and by the\nthread of \"gipsy\" he got at the ball, which is to say, his ass, for it was, in fact, Dapple that carried\nPasamonte, who to escape recognition and to sell the ass had disguised himself as a gipsy, being able to\nspeak the gipsy language, and many more, as well as if they were his own. Sancho saw him and\nrecognised him, and the instant he did so he shouted to him, \"Ginesillo, you thief, give up my treasure,\nrelease my life, embarrass thyself not with my repose, quit my ass, leave my delight, be off, rip, get thee\ngone, thief, and give up what is not thine.\"\nThere was no necessity for so many words or objurgations, for at the first one Gines jumped down, and at\na like racing speed made off and got clear of them all. Sancho hastened to his Dapple, and embracing him\nhe said, \"How hast thou fared, my blessing, Dapple of my eyes, my comrade?\" all the while kissing him\nand caressing him as if he were a human being. The ass held his peace, and let himself be kissed and\ncaressed by Sancho without answering a single word. They all came up and congratulated him on having\nfound Dapple, Don Quixote especially, who told him that notwithstanding this he would not cancel the\n-117\n\norder for the three ass-colts, for which Sancho thanked him.\nWhile the two had been going along conversing in this fashion, the curate observed to Dorothea: \"Is it not\na strange thing to see how readily this unhappy gentleman believes all these figments and lies, simply\nbecause they are in the style and manner of the absurdities of his books?\"\n\"So it is,\" said Cardenio; \"and so uncommon and unexampled, that were one to attempt to invent and\nconcoct such a character in fiction, I doubt if there be any wit keen enough to imagine it.\"\n\"But another strange thing about it,\" said the curate, \"is that, apart from the silly things which this worthy\ngentleman says in connection with his madness, when other subjects are dealt with, he can discuss them\nin a perfectly rational manner, showing that his mind is quite clear and composed; so that, provided his\nchivalry is not touched upon, no one would take him to be anything but a man of thoroughly sound\nunderstanding.\"\nWhile they were holding this conversation Don Quixote continued his with Sancho, saying:\n\"Friend Panza, let us forgive and forget as to our quarrels, and tell me now, dismissing anger and\nirritation, where, how, and when didst thou find Dulcinea? What was she doing? What didst thou say to\nher? What did she answer? How did she look when she was reading my letter? Who copied it out for\nthee? and everything in the matter that seems to thee worth knowing, asking, and learning; neither adding\nnor falsifying to give me pleasure, nor yet curtailing lest you should deprive me of it.\"\n\"Senor,\" replied Sancho, \"if the truth is to be told, nobody copied out the letter for me, for I carried no\nletter at all.\"\n\"It is as thou sayest,\" said Don Quixote, \"for the note-book in which I wrote it I found in my own\npossession two days after thy departure, which gave me very great vexation, as I knew not what thou\nwouldst do on finding thyself without any letter; and I made sure thou wouldst return from the place\nwhere thou didst first miss it.\"\n\"So I should have done,\" said Sancho, \"if I had not got it by heart when your worship read it to me, so\nthat I repeated it to a sacristan, who copied it out for me from hearing it, so exactly that he said in all the\ndays of his life, though he had read many a letter of excommunication, he had never seen or read so pretty\na letter as that.\"\n\"And hast thou got it still in thy memory, Sancho?\" said Don Quixote.\n\"No, senor,\" replied Sancho, \"for as soon as I had repeated it, seeing there was no further use for it, I set\nabout forgetting it; and if I recollect any of it, it is that about 'Sobbing,' I mean to say 'Sovereign Lady,'\nand the end 'Yours till death, the Knight of Regretful Appearance;' and between these two I put into it\nmore than three hundred 'my souls' and 'my life's' and 'my eyes.\"\nCHAPTER XXXI.\nOF THE DELECTABLE DISCUSSION BETWEEN DON QUIXOTE AND SANCHO PANZA, HIS\nSQUIRE, TOGETHER WITH OTHER INCIDENTS\n\"All that is not unsatisfactory to me,\" said Don Quixote. \"Go on; thou didst reach her; and what was that\nqueen of beauty doing? Surely thou didst find her stringing pearls, or embroidering some device in gold\nthread for this her enslaved knight.\"\n-118\n\n\"I did not,\" said Sancho, \"but I found her winnowing two bushels of wheat in the yard of her house.\"\n\"Then depend upon it,\" said Don Quixote, \"the grains of that wheat were pearls when touched by her\nhands; and didst thou look, friend? was it white wheat or brown?\"\n\"It was neither, but red,\" said Sancho.\n\"Then I promise thee,\" said Don Quixote, \"that, winnowed by her hands, beyond a doubt the bread it\nmade was of the whitest; but go on; when thou gavest her my letter, did she kiss it? Did she place it on\nher head? Did she perform any ceremony befitting it, or what did she do?\"\n\"When I went to give it to her,\" replied Sancho, \"she was hard at it swaying from side to side with a lot of\nwheat she had in the sieve, and she said to me, 'Lay the letter, friend, on the top of that sack, for I cannot\nread it until I have done sifting all this.\"\n\"Discreet lady!\" said Don Quixote; \"that was in order to read it at her leisure and enjoy it; proceed,\nSancho; while she was engaged in her occupation what converse did she hold with thee? What did she ask\nabout me, and what answer didst thou give? Make haste; tell me all, and let not an atom be left behind in\nthe ink-bottle.\"\n\"She asked me nothing,\" said Sancho; \"but I told her how your worship was left doing penance in her\nservice, naked from the waist up, in among these mountains like a savage, sleeping on the ground, not\neating bread off a tablecloth nor combing your beard, weeping and cursing your fortune.\"\n\"In saying I cursed my fortune thou saidst wrong,\" said Don Quixote; \"for rather do I bless it and shall\nbless it all the days of my life for having made me worthy of aspiring to love so lofty a lady as Dulcinea\ndel Toboso.\"\n\"And so lofty she is,\" said Sancho, \"that she overtops me by more than a hand's-breadth.\"\n\"What! Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"didst thou measure with her?\"\n\"I measured in this way,\" said Sancho; \"going to help her to put a sack of wheat on the back of an ass, we\ncame so close together that I could see she stood more than a good palm over me.\"\n\"Well!\" said Don Quixote, \"and doth she not of a truth accompany and adorn this greatness with a\nthousand million charms of mind! But one thing thou wilt not deny, Sancho; when thou camest close to\nher didst thou not perceive a Sabaean odour, an aromatic fragrance, a, I know not what, delicious, that I\ncannot find a name for; I mean a redolence, an exhalation, as if thou wert in the shop of some dainty\nglover?\"\n\"All I can say is,\" said Sancho, \"that I did perceive a little odour, something goaty; it must have been that\nshe was all in a sweat with hard work.\"\n\"It could not be that,\" said Don Quixote, \"but thou must have been suffering from cold in the head, or\nmust have smelt thyself; for I know well what would be the scent of that rose among thorns, that lily of\nthe field, that dissolved amber.\"\n\"Maybe so,\" replied Sancho; \"there often comes from myself that same odour which then seemed to me\nto come from her grace the lady Dulcinea; but that's no wonder, for one devil is like another.\"\n-119\n\n\"Well then,\" continued Don Quixote, \"now she has done sifting the corn and sent it to the mill; what did\nshe do when she read the letter?\"\n\"As for the letter,\" said Sancho, \"she did not read it, for she said she could neither read nor write; instead\nof that she tore it up into small pieces, saying that she did not want to let anyone read it lest her secrets\nshould become known in the village, and that what I had told her by word of mouth about the love your\nworship bore her, and the extraordinary penance you were doing for her sake, was enough; and, to make\nan end of it, she told me to tell your worship that she kissed your hands, and that she had a greater desire\nto see you than to write to you; and that therefore she entreated and commanded you, on sight of this\npresent, to come out of these thickets, and to have done with carrying on absurdities, and to set out at\nonce for El Toboso, unless something else of greater importance should happen, for she had a great desire\nto see your worship. She laughed greatly when I told her how your worship was called The Knight of\nRegretful Appearance; I asked her if that Biscayan the other day had been there; and she told me he had,\nand that he was an honest fellow; I asked her too about the galley slaves, but she said she had not seen\nany as yet.\"\n\"So far all goes well,\" said Don Quixote; \"but tell me what jewel was it that she gave thee on taking thy\nleave, in return for thy tidings of me? For it is a usual and ancient custom with knights and ladies errant to\ngive the squires, damsels, or dwarfs who bring tidings of their ladies to the knights, or of their knights to\nthe ladies, some rich jewel as a guerdon for good news,' and acknowledgment of the message.\"\n\"That is very likely,\" said Sancho, \"and a good custom it was, to my mind; but that must have been in\ndays gone by, for now it would seem to be the custom only to give a piece of bread and cheese; because\nthat was what my lady Dulcinea gave me over the top of the yard-wall when I took leave of her; and more\nby token it was sheep's-milk cheese.\"\n\"She is generous in the extreme,\" said Don Quixote, \"and if she did not give thee a jewel of gold, no\ndoubt it must have been because she had not one to hand there to give thee; but sleeves are good after\nEaster; I shall see her and all shall be made right. But knowest thou what amazes me, Sancho? It seems to\nme thou must have gone and come through the air, for thou hast taken but little more than three days to go\nto El Toboso and return, though it is more than thirty leagues from here to there. From which I am\ninclined to think that the wise enchanter who is my friend, and watches over my interests (for of necessity\nthere is and must be one, or else I should not be a right knight-errant), that this same, I say, must have\nhelped thee to travel without thy knowledge; for some of these sages will catch up a knight-errant\nsleeping in his bed, and without his knowing how or in what way it happened, he wakes up the next day\nmore than a thousand leagues away from the place where he went to sleep. And if it were not for this,\nknights-errant would not be able to give aid to one another in peril, as they do at every turn. For a knight,\nmaybe, is fighting in the mountains of Armenia with some dragon, or fierce serpent, or another knight,\nand gets the worst of the battle, and is at the point of death; but when he least looks for it, there appears\nover against him on a cloud, or chariot of fire, another knight, a friend of his, who just before had been in\nEngland, and who takes his part, and delivers him from death; and at night he finds himself in his own\nquarters supping very much to his satisfaction; and yet from one place to the other will have been two or\nthree thousand leagues. And all this is done by the craft and skill of the sage enchanters who take care of\nthose valiant knights; so that, friend Sancho, I find no difficulty in believing that thou mayest have gone\nfrom this place to El Toboso and returned in such a short time, since, as I have said, some friendly\nenchanter must have carried thee through the air without thee perceiving it.\"\n\"That must have been it,\" said Sancho, \"for indeed Rocinante went like a gipsy's ass with quicksilver in\nhis ears.\"\n\"Quicksilver!\" said Don Quixote, \"aye and what is more, a legion of devils, folk that can travel and make\n-120\n\nothers travel without being weary, exactly as the whim seizes them. But putting this aside, what thinkest\nthou I ought to do about my lady's command to go and see her? For though I feel that I am bound to obey\nher mandate, I feel too that I am debarred by the boon I have accorded to the princess that accompanies\nus, and the law of chivalry compels me to have regard for my word in preference to my inclination; on the\none hand the desire to see my lady pursues and harasses me, on the other my solemn promise and the\nglory I shall win in this enterprise urge and call me\"\n\"Ah! what a sad state your worship's brains are in!\" said Sancho. \"Tell me, senor, do you mean to travel\nall that way for nothing, and to let slip and lose so rich and great a match as this where they give as a\nportion a kingdom that in sober truth I have heard say is more than twenty thousand leagues round about,\nand abounds with all things necessary to support human life, and is bigger than Portugal and Castile put\ntogether? Peace, for the love of God! Blush for what you have said, and take my advice, and forgive me,\nand marry at once in the first village where there is a curate; if not, here is our curate who will do the\nbusiness beautifully; remember, I am old enough to give advice, and this I am giving comes pat to the\npurpose; for a sparrow in the hand is better than a vulture on the wing, and he who has the good to his\nhand and chooses the bad, that the good he complains of may not come to him.\"\n\"Look here, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote. \"If thou art advising me to marry, in order that immediately on\nslaying the giant I may become king, and be able to confer favours on thee, and give thee what I have\npromised, let me tell thee I shall be able very easily to satisfy thy desires without marrying; for before\ngoing into battle I will make it a stipulation that, if I come out of it victorious, even I do not marry, they\nshall give me a portion portion of the kingdom, that I may bestow it upon whomsoever I choose, and\nwhen they give it to me upon whom wouldst thou have me bestow it but upon thee?\"\n\"That is plain speaking,\" said Sancho; \"but let your worship take care to choose it on the seacoast, so that\nif I don't like the life, I may be able to ship off my black vassals and deal with them as I have said; don't\nmind going to see my lady Dulcinea now, but go and kill this giant and let us finish off this business; for\nby God it strikes me it will be one of great honour and great profit.\"\n\"I hold thou art in the right of it, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"and I will take thy advice as to\naccompanying the princess before going to see Dulcinea; but I counsel thee not to say anything to any\none, or to those who are with us, about what we have considered and discussed, for as Dulcinea is so\ndecorous that she does not wish her thoughts to be known it is not right that I or anyone for me should\ndisclose them.\"\n\"Well then, if that be so,\" said Sancho, \"how is it that your worship makes all those you overcome by\nyour arm go to present themselves before my lady Dulcinea, this being the same thing as signing your\nname to it that you love her and are her lover? And as those who go must perforce kneel before her and\nsay they come from your worship to submit themselves to her, how can the thoughts of both of you be\nhid?\"\n\"O, how silly and simple thou art!\" said Don Quixote; \"seest thou not, Sancho, that this tends to her\ngreater exaltation? For thou must know that according to our way of thinking in chivalry, it is a high\nhonour to a lady to have many knights-errant in her service, whose thoughts never go beyond serving her\nfor her own sake, and who look for no other reward for their great and true devotion than that she should\nbe willing to accept them as her knights.\"\n\"It is with that kind of love,\" said Sancho, \"I have heard preachers say we ought to love our Lord, for\nhimself alone, without being moved by the hope of glory or the fear of punishment; though for my part, I\nwould rather love and serve him for what he could do.\"\n-121\n\n\"The devil take thee for a clown!\" said Don Quixote, \"and what shrewd things thou sayest at times! One\nwould think thou hadst studied.\"\n\"In faith, then, I cannot even read.\"\nMaster Nicholas here called out to them to wait a while, as they wanted to halt and drink at a little spring\nthere was there. Don Quixote drew up, not a little to the satisfaction of Sancho, for he was by this time\nweary of telling so many lies, and in dread of his master catching him tripping, for though he knew that\nDulcinea was a peasant girl of El Toboso, he had never seen her in all his life. Cardenio had now put on\nthe clothes which Dorothea was wearing when they found her, and though they were not very good, they\nwere far better than those he put off. They dismounted together by the side of the spring, and with what\nthe curate had provided himself with at the inn they appeased, though not very well, the keen appetite\nthey all of them brought with them.\nWhile they were so employed there happened to come by a youth passing on his way, who stopping to\nexamine the party at the spring, the next moment ran to Don Quixote and clasping him round the legs,\nbegan to weep freely, saying, \"O, senor, do you not know me? Look at me well; I am that lad Andres that\nyour worship released from the oak-tree where I was tied.\"\nDon Quixote recognised him, and taking his hand he turned to those present and said: \"That your\nworships may see how important it is to have knights-errant to redress the wrongs and injuries done by\ntyrannical and wicked men in this world, I may tell you that some days ago passing through a wood, I\nheard cries and piteous complaints as of a person in pain and distress; I immediately hastened, impelled\nby my bounden duty, to the quarter whence the plaintive accents seemed to me to proceed, and I found\ntied to an oak this lad who now stands before you, which in my heart I rejoice at, for his testimony will\nnot permit me to depart from the truth in any particular. He was, I say, tied to an oak, naked from the\nwaist up, and a clown, whom I afterwards found to be his master, was scarifying him by lashes with the\nreins of his mare. As soon as I saw him I asked the reason of so cruel a flagellation. The boor replied that\nhe was flogging him because he was his servant and because of carelessness that proceeded rather from\ndishonesty than stupidity; on which this boy said, 'Senor, he flogs me only because I ask for my wages.'\nThe master made I know not what speeches and explanations, which, though I listened to them, I did not\naccept. In short, I compelled the clown to unbind him, and to swear he would take him with him, and pay\nhim real by real, and perfumed into the bargain. Is not all this true, Andres my son? Didst thou not mark\nwith what authority I commanded him, and with what humility he promised to do all I enjoined, specified,\nand required of him? Answer without hesitation; tell these gentlemen what took place, that they may see\nthat it is as great an advantage as I say to have knights-errant abroad.\"\n\"All that your worship has said is quite true,\" answered the lad; \"but the end of the business turned out\njust the opposite of what your worship supposes.\"\n\"How! the opposite?\" said Don Quixote; \"did not the clown pay thee then?\"\n\"Not only did he not pay me,\" replied the lad, \"but as soon as your worship had passed out of the wood\nand we were alone, he tied me up again to the same oak and gave me a fresh flogging, that left me like a\nflayed Saint Bartholomew; and every stroke he gave me he followed up with some jest or gibe about\nhaving made a fool of your worship, and but for the pain I was suffering I should have laughed at the\nthings he said. In short he left me in such a condition that I have been until now in a hospital getting cured\nof the injuries which that rascally clown inflicted on me then; for all which your worship is to blame; for\nif you had gone your own way and not come where there was no call for you, nor meddled in other\npeople's affairs, my master would have been content with giving me one or two dozen lashes, and would\nhave then loosed me and paid me what he owed me; but when your worship abused him so out of\n-122\n\nmeasure, and gave him so many hard words, his anger was kindled; and as he could not revenge himself\non you, as soon as he saw you had left him the storm burst upon me in such a way, that I feel as if I\nshould never be a man again.\"\n\"The mischief,\" said Don Quixote, \"lay in my going away; for I should not have gone until I had seen\nthee paid; because I ought to have known well by long experience that there is no clown who will keep\nhis word if he finds it will not suit him to keep it; but thou rememberest, Andres, that I swore if he did not\npay thee I would go and seek him, and find him though he were to hide himself in the whale's belly.\"\n\"That is true,\" said Andres; \"but it was of no use.\"\n\"Thou shalt see now whether it is of use or not,\" said Don Quixote; and so saying, he got up hastily and\nbade Sancho bridle Rocinante, who was browsing while they were eating. Dorothea asked him what he\nmeant to do. He replied that he meant to go in search of this clown and chastise him for such iniquitous\nconduct, and see Andres paid to the last maravedi, despite and in the teeth of all the clowns in the world.\nTo which she replied that he must remember that in accordance with his promise he could not engage in\nany enterprise until he had concluded hers; and that as he knew this better than anyone, he should restrain\nhis ardour until his return from her kingdom.\n\"That is true,\" said Don Quixote, \"and Andres must have patience until my return as you say, senora; but\nI once more swear and promise not to stop until I have seen him avenged and paid.\"\n\"I have no faith in those oaths,\" said Andres; \"I would rather have now something to help me to get to\nSeville than all the revenges in the world; if you have here anything to eat that I can take with me, give it\nme, and God be with your worship and all knights-errant; and may their errands turn out as well for\nthemselves as they have for me.\"\nSancho took out from his store a piece of bread and another of cheese, and giving them to the lad he said,\n\"Here, take this, brother Andres, for we have all of us a share in your misfortune.\"\n\"Why, what share have you got?\"\n\"This share of bread and cheese I am giving you,\" answered Sancho; \"and God knows whether I shall feel\nthe want of it myself or not; for I would have you know, friend, that we squires to knights-errant have to\nbear a great deal of hunger and hard fortune, and even other things more easily felt than told.\"\nAndres seized his bread and cheese, and seeing that nobody gave him anything more, bent his head, and\ntook hold of the road, as the saying is. However, before leaving he said, \"For the love of God, sir\nknight-errant, if you ever meet me again, though you may see them cutting me to pieces, give me no aid\nor succour, but leave me to my misfortune, which will not be so great but that a greater will come to me\nby being helped by your worship, on whom and all the knights-errant that have ever been born God send\nhis curse.\"\nDon Quixote was getting up to chastise him, but he took to his heels at such a pace that no one attempted\nto follow him; and mightily chapfallen was Don Quixote at Andres' story, and the others had to take great\ncare to restrain their laughter so as not to put him entirely out of countenance.\nCHAPTER XXXII.\nWHICH TREATS OF WHAT BEFELL DON QUIXOTE'S PARTY AT THE INN\n-123\n\nTheir dainty repast being finished, they saddled at once, and without any adventure worth mentioning\nthey reached next day the inn, the object of Sancho Panza's fear and dread; but though he would have\nrather not entered it, there was no help for it. The landlady, the landlord, their daughter, and Maritornes,\nwhen they saw Don Quixote and Sancho coming, went out to welcome them with signs of hearty\nsatisfaction, which Don Quixote received with dignity and gravity, and bade them make up a better bed\nfor him than the last time: to which the landlady replied that if he paid better than he did the last time she\nwould give him one fit for a prince. Don Quixote said he would, so they made up a tolerable one for him\nin the same garret as before; and he lay down at once, being sorely shaken and in want of sleep. No\nsooner was the door shut upon him than the landlady made at the barber, and seizing him by the beard,\nsaid:\n\"By my faith you are not going to make a beard of my tail any longer; you must give me back tail, for it is\na shame the way that thing of my husband's goes tossing about on the floor; I mean the comb that I used\nto stick in my good tail.\"\nBut for all she tugged at it the barber would not give it up until the curate told him to let her have it, as\nthere was now no further occasion for that stratagem, because he might declare himself and appear in his\nown character, and tell Don Quixote that he had fled to this inn when those thieves the galley slaves\nrobbed him; and should he ask for the princess's squire, they could tell him that she had sent him on\nbefore her to give notice to the people of her kingdom that she was coming, and bringing with her the\ndeliverer of them all. On this the barber cheerfully restored the tail to the landlady, and at the same time\nthey returned all the accessories they had borrowed to effect Don Quixote's deliverance. All the people of\nthe inn were struck with astonishment at the beauty of Dorothea, and even at the comely figure of the\nshepherd Cardenio. The curate made them get ready such fare as there was in the inn, and the landlord, in\nhope of better payment, served them up a tolerably good dinner. All this time Don Quixote was asleep,\nand they thought it best not to waken him, as sleeping would now do him more good than eating.\nWhile at dinner, the company consisting of the landlord, his wife, their daughter, Maritornes, and all the\ntravellers, they discussed the strange madness of Don Quixote and the manner in which he had been\nfound; and the landlady told them what had taken place between him and the mule-driver; and then,\nlooking round to see if Sancho was there, when she saw he was not, she gave them the whole story of his\nblanketing, which they received with no little amusement. But on the curate observing that it was the\nbooks of chivalry which Don Quixote had read that had turned his brain, the landlord said:\n\"I cannot understand how that can be, for in truth to my mind there is no better reading in the world, and I\nhave here two or three of them, with other writings that are the very life, not only of myself but of plenty\nmore; for when it is harvest-time, the reapers flock here on holidays, and there is always one among them\nwho can read and who takes up one of these books, and we gather round him, thirty or more of us, and\nstay listening to him with a delight that makes our grey hairs grow young again. At least I can say for\nmyself that when I hear of what furious and terrible blows the knights deliver, I am seized with the\nlonging to do the same, and I would like to be hearing about them night and day.\"\n\"And I just as much,\" said the landlady, \"because I never have a quiet moment in my house except when\nyou are listening to some one reading; for then you are so taken up that for the time being you forget to\nscold.\"\n\"That is true,\" said Maritornes; \"and, faith, I relish hearing these things greatly too, for they are very\npretty; especially when they describe some lady or another in the arms of her knight under the orange\ntrees, and the duenna who is keeping watch for them half dead with envy and fright; all this I say is as\ngood as honey.\"\n-124\n\n\"And you, what do you think, young lady?\" said the curate turning to the landlord's daughter.\n\"I don't know indeed, senor,\" said she; \"I listen too, and to tell the truth, though I do not understand it, I\nlike hearing it; but it is not the blows that my father likes that I like, but the laments the knights utter\nwhen they are separated from their ladies; and indeed they sometimes make me weep with the pity I feel\nfor them.\"\n\"Then you would console them if it was for you they wept, young lady?\" said Dorothea.\n\"I don't know what I should do,\" said the girl; \"I only know that there are some of those ladies so cruel\nthat they call their knights tigers and lions and a thousand other foul names: and Jesus! I don't know what\nsort of folk they can be, so unfeeling and heartless, that rather than bestow a glance upon a worthy man\nthey leave him to die or go mad. I don't know what is the good of such prudery; if it is for honour's sake,\nwhy not marry them? That's all they want.\"\n\"Hush, child,\" said the landlady; \"it seems to me thou knowest a great deal about these things, and it is\nnot fit for girls to know or talk so much.\"\n\"As the gentleman asked me, I could not help answering him,\" said the girl.\n\"Well now,\" said the curate, turning to the barber, \"We could use my friend's housekeeper and niece\nhere.\"\n\"Nay,\" said the barber, \"I can do just as well to carry them to the yard or to the hearth, and there is a very\ngood fire there.\"\n\"What! your worship would burn my books!\" said the landlord.\n\"That's it,\" said the landlord; \"but if you want to burn any, let it be that about the Great Captain and that\nDiego Garcia; for I would rather have a child of mine burnt than either of the others.\"\n\"Brother,\" said the curate, \"the books of which you speak are made up of lies, and are full of folly and\nnonsense.\" \"Tell that to my father,\" said the landlord. \"By God, your worship should read what I have\nread of Felixmarte of Hircania, how with one single backstroke he cleft five giants asunder through the\nmiddle as if they had been made of bean-pods like the little friars the children make; and another time he\nattacked a very great and powerful army, in which there were more than a million six hundred thousand\nsoldiers, all armed from head to foot, and he routed them all as if they had been flocks of sheep.\n\"And then, what do you say to the good Cirongilio of Thrace, that was so stout and bold; as may be seen\nin the book, where it is related that as he was sailing along a river there came up out of the midst of the\nwater against him a fiery serpent, and he, as soon as he saw it, flung himself upon it and got astride of its\nscaly shoulders, and squeezed its throat with both hands with such force that the serpent, finding he was\nthrottling it, had nothing for it but to let itself sink to the bottom of the river, carrying with it the knight\nwho would not let go his hold; and when they got down there he found himself among palaces and\ngardens so pretty that it was a wonder to see; and then the serpent changed itself into an old ancient man,\nwho told him such things as were never heard. Hold your peace, senor; for if you were to hear this you\nwould go mad with delight.\"\n\"But consider, brother,\" said the curate once more, \"there never was any Felixmarte of Hircania in the\nworld, nor any Cirongilio of Thrace, or any of the other knights of the same sort, that the books of\nchivalry talk of; the whole thing is the fabrication and invention of idle wits, devised by them for the\n-125\n\npurpose you describe of beguiling the time, as your reapers do when they read; for I swear to you in all\nseriousness there never were any such knights in the world, and no such exploits or nonsense ever\nhappened anywhere.\"\n\"Try that bone on another dog,\" said the landlord; \"as if I did not know how many make five, and where\nmy shoe pinches me; don't think to feed me with pap, for by God I am no fool. It is a good joke for your\nworship to try and persuade me that everything these good books say is nonsense and lies, and they\nprinted by the license of the Lords of the Royal Council, as if they were people who would allow such a\nlot of lies to be printed all together, and so many battles and enchantments that they take away one's\nsenses.\"\n\"I have told you, friend,\" said the curate, \"that this is done to divert our idle thoughts; and as in\nwell-ordered states games of chess, fives, and billiards are allowed for the diversion of those who do not\ncare, or are not obliged, or are unable to work, so books of this kind are allowed to be printed, on the\nsupposition that, what indeed is the truth, there can be nobody so ignorant as to take any of them for true\nstories; and if it were permitted me now, and the present company desired it, I could say something about\nthe qualities books of chivalry should possess to be good ones, that would be to the advantage and even to\nthe taste of some; but I hope the time will come when I can communicate my ideas to some one who may\nbe able to mend matters; and in the meantime, senor landlord, believe what I have said, and take your\nbooks, and make up your mind about their truth or falsehood, and much good may they do you; and God\ngrant you may not fall lame of the same foot your guest Don Quixote halts on.\"\n\"No fear of that,\" returned the landlord; \"I shall not be so mad as to make a knight-errant of myself; for I\nsee well enough that things are not now as they used to be in those days, when they say those famous\nknights roamed about the world.\"\nSancho had made his appearance in the middle of this conversation, and he was very much troubled and\ncast down by what he heard said about knights-errant being now no longer in vogue, and all books of\nchivalry being folly and lies; and he resolved in his heart to wait and see what came of this journey of his\nmaster's, and if it did not turn out as happily as his master expected, he determined to leave him and go\nback to his wife and children and his ordinary labour.\n[Chapters XXXIII AND XXXIV and part of the next chapter are omitted]\nCHAPTER XXXV.\nWHICH TREATS OF THE HEROIC AND PRODIGIOUS BATTLE DON QUIXOTE HAD WITH\nCERTAIN SKINS OF RED WINE\nSancho left the group conversing and went up to the garret to see how Don Quixote was faring. A few\nmoments later he burst upon them in wild excitement, shouting, \"Run, sirs! quick; and help my master,\nwho is in the thick of the toughest and stiffest battle I ever laid eyes on. By the living God he has given\nthe giant, the enemy of my lady the Princess Micomicona, such a slash that he has sliced his head clean\noff as if it were a turnip.\"\n\"What are you talking about, brother?\" said the curate. \"Are you in your senses, Sancho? How the devil\ncan it be as you say, when the giant is two thousand leagues away?\"\nHere they heard a loud noise in the chamber, and Don Quixote shouting out, \"Stand, thief, brigand,\nvillain; now I have got thee, and thy scimitar shall not avail thee!\" And then it seemed as though he were\nslashing vigorously at the wall.\n-126\n\n\"Don't stop to listen,\" said Sancho, \"but go in and part them or help my master: though there is no need\nof that now, for no doubt the giant is dead by this time and giving account to God of his past wicked life;\nfor I saw the blood flowing on the ground, and the head cut off and fallen on one side, and it is as big as a\nlarge wine-skin.\"\n\"May I die,\" said the landlord at this, \"if Don Quixote or Don Devil has not been slashing some of the\nskins of red wine that stand full at his bed's head, and the spilt wine must be what this good fellow takes\nfor blood;\" and so saying he went into the room and the rest after him, and there they found Don Quixote\nin the strangest costume in the world. He was in his shirt, which was not long enough in front to cover his\nthighs completely and was six fingers shorter behind; his legs were very long and lean, covered with hair,\nand anything but clean; on his head he had a little greasy red cap that belonged to the host, round his left\narm he had rolled the blanket of the bed, to which Sancho, for reasons best known to himself, owed a\ngrudge, and in his right hand he held his unsheathed sword, with which he was slashing about on all sides,\nuttering exclamations as if he were actually fighting some giant: and the best of it was his eyes were not\nopen, for he was fast asleep, and dreaming that he was doing battle with the giant. For his imagination\nwas so wrought upon by the adventure he was going to accomplish, that it made him dream he had\nalready reached the kingdom of Micomicon, and was engaged in combat with his enemy; and believing\nhe was laying on the giant, he had given so many sword cuts to the skins that the whole room was full of\nwine. On seeing this the landlord was so enraged that he fell on Don Quixote, and with his clenched fist\nbegan to pummel him in such a way, that if Cardenio and the curate had not dragged him off, he would\nhave brought the war of the giant to an end. But in spite of all the poor gentleman never woke until the\nbarber brought a great pot of cold water from the well and flung it with one dash all over his body, on\nwhich Don Quixote woke up, but not so completely as to understand what was the matter. Dorothea,\nseeing how short and slight his attire was, would not go in to witness the battle between her champion and\nher opponent. As for Sancho, he went searching all over the floor for the head of the giant, and not\nfinding it he said, \"I see now that it's all enchantment in this house; for the last time, on this very spot\nwhere I am now, I got ever so many thumps without knowing who gave them to me, or being able to see\nanybody; and now this head is not to be seen anywhere about, though I saw it cut off with my own eyes\nand the blood running from the body as if from a fountain.\"\n\"What blood and fountains are you talking about, enemy of God and his saints?\" said the landlord. \"Don't\nyou see, you thief, that the blood and the fountain are only these skins here that have been stabbed and the\nred wine swimming all over the room?--and I wish I saw the soul of him that stabbed them swimming in\nhell.\"\n\"I know nothing about that,\" said Sancho; \"all I know is it will be my bad luck that through not finding\nthis head my county will melt away like salt in water;\"--for Sancho awake was worse than his master\nasleep, so much had his master's promises addled his wits.\nThe landlord was beside himself at the idiocy of the squire and the mischievous doings of the master, and\nswore it should not be like the last time when they went without paying; and that their privileges of\nchivalry should not hold good this time to let one or other of them off without paying, even to the cost of\nthe plugs that would have to be put to the damaged wine-skins. The curate was holding Don Quixote's\nhands, who, fancying he had now ended the adventure and was in the presence of the Princess\nMicomicona, knelt before the curate and said, \"Exalted and beauteous lady, your highness may live from\nthis day forth fearless of any harm this base being could do you; and I too from this day forth am released\nfrom the promise I gave you, since by the help of God on high and by the favour of her by whom I live\nand breathe, I have fulfilled it so successfully.\"\n\"Did not I say so?\" said Sancho on hearing this. \"You see I wasn't drunk; there you see my master has\nalready salted the giant; there's no doubt about the bulls; my county is all right!\"\n-127\n\nWho could have helped laughing at the absurdities of the pair, master and man? And laugh they did, all\nexcept the landlord, who cursed himself; but at length the barber, Cardenio, and the curate contrived with\nno small trouble to get Don Quixote on the bed, and he fell asleep with every appearance of excessive\nweariness. They left him to sleep, and came out to the gate of the inn to console Sancho Panza on not\nhaving found the head of the giant; but much more work had they to appease the landlord, who was\nfurious at the sudden death of his wine-skins; and said the landlady half scolding, half crying, \"At an evil\nmoment and in an unlucky hour he came into my house, this knight-errant--would that I had never set\neyes on him, for dear he has cost me; the last time he went off with the overnight score against him for\nsupper, bed, straw, and barley, for himself and his squire and a hack and an ass, saying he was a knight\nadventurer--God send unlucky adventures to him and all the adventurers in the world--and therefore not\nbound to pay anything, for it was so settled by the knight-errantry tariff: and then, all because of him,\ncame the other gentleman and carried off my tail, and gives it back more than two cuartillos the worse, all\nstripped of its hair, so that it is no use for my husband's purpose; and then, for a finishing touch to all, to\nburst my wine-skins and spill my wine! I wish I saw his own blood spilt! But let him not deceive himself,\nfor, by the bones of my father and the shade of my mother, they shall pay me down every quarts; or my\nname is not what it is, and I am not my father's daughter.\" All this and more to the same effect the\nlandlady delivered with great irritation, and her good maid Maritornes backed her up, while the daughter\nheld her peace and smiled from time to time. The curate smoothed matters by promising to make good all\nlosses to the best of his power, not only as regarded the wine-skins but also the wine, and above all the\ndepreciation of the tail which they set such store by. Dorothea comforted Sancho, telling him that she\npledged herself, as soon as it should appear certain that his master had decapitated the giant, and she\nfound herself peacefully established in her kingdom, to bestow upon him the best county there was in it.\nWith this Sancho consoled himself, and assured the princess she might rely upon it that he had seen the\nhead of the giant, and more by token it had a beard that reached to the girdle, and that if it was not to be\nseen now it was because everything that happened in that house went by enchantment, as he himself had\nproved the last time he had lodged there. Dorothea said she fully believed it, and that he need not be\nuneasy, for all would go well and turn out as he wished.\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\nWHICH TREATS OF MORE CURIOUS INCIDENTS THAT OCCURRED AT THE INN\nJust at that instant the landlord, who was standing at the gate of the inn, exclaimed, \"Here comes a fine\ntroop of guests; if they stop here we may say gaudeamus.\"\n\"What are they?\" said Cardenio.\n\"Four men,\" said the landlord, \"riding in Moorish fashion, with lances and bucklers, and all with black\nveils, and with them there is a woman in white on a side-saddle, whose face is also veiled, and two\nattendants on foot.\"\n\"Are they very near?\" said the curate.\n\"So near,\" answered the landlord, \"that here they come.\"\nHearing this Dorothea covered her face, and Cardenio retreated into Don Quixote's room, and they hardly\nhad time to do so before the whole party the host had described entered the inn, and the four that were on\nhorseback, who were of highbred appearance and bearing, dismounted, and came forward to take down\nthe woman who rode on the side-saddle, and one of them taking her in his arms placed her in a chair that\nstood at the entrance of the room where Cardenio had hidden himself. All this time neither she nor they\n-128\n\nhad removed their veils or spoken a word, only on sitting down on the chair the woman gave a deep sigh\nand let her arms fall like one that was ill and weak. The attendants on foot then led the horses away to the\nstable. Observing this the curate, curious to know who these people in such a dress and preserving such\nsilence were, went to where the servants were standing and put the question to one of them, who\nanswered him.\n\"Faith, sir, I cannot tell you who they are, I only know they seem to be people of distinction, particularly\nhe who advanced to take the lady you saw in his arms; and I say so because all the rest show him respect,\nand nothing is done except what he directs and orders.\"\n\"And the lady, who is she?\" asked the curate.\n\"That I cannot tell you either,\" said the servant, \"for I have not seen her face all the way: I have indeed\nheard her sigh many times and utter such groans that she seems to be giving up the ghost every time; but\nit is no wonder if we do not know more than we have told you, as my comrade and I have only been in\ntheir company two days, for having met us on the road they begged and persuaded us to accompany them\nto Andalusia, promising to pay us well.\"\n\"And have you heard any of them called by his name?\" asked the curate.\n\"No, indeed,\" replied the servant; \"they all preserve a marvellous silence on the road, for not a sound is to\nbe heard among them except the poor lady's sighs and sobs, which make us pity her; and we feel sure that\nwherever it is she is going, it is against her will, and as far as one can judge from her dress she is a nun or,\nwhat is more likely, about to become one; and perhaps it is because taking the vows is not of her own free\nwill, that she is so unhappy as she seems to be.\"\n\"That may well be,\" said the curate, and leaving them he returned to where Dorothea was, who, hearing\nthe veiled lady sigh, moved by natural compassion drew near to her and said, \"What are you suffering\nfrom, senora? If it be anything that women are accustomed and know how to relieve, I offer you my\nservices with all my heart.\"\nTo this the unhappy lady made no reply; and though Dorothea repeated her offers more earnestly she still\nkept silence, until the gentleman with the veil, who, the servant said, was obeyed by the rest, approached\nand said to Dorothea, \"Do not give yourself the trouble, senora, of making any offers to that woman, for it\nis her way to give no thanks for anything that is done for her; and do not try to make her answer unless\nyou want to hear some lie from her lips.\"\n\"I have never told a lie,\" was the immediate reply of her who had been silent until now; \"on the contrary,\nit is because I am so truthful and so ignorant of lying devices that I am now in this miserable condition;\nand this I call you yourself to witness, for it is my unstained truth that has made you false and a liar.\"\nCardenio heard these words clearly and distinctly, being quite close to the speaker, for there was only the\ndoor of Don Quixote's room between them, and the instant he did so, uttering a loud exclamation he\ncried, \"Good God! what is this I hear? What voice is this that has reached my ears?\" Startled at the voice\nthe lady turned her head; and not seeing the speaker she stood up and attempted to enter the room;\nobserving which the gentleman held her back, preventing her from moving a step. In her agitation and\nsudden movement the silk with which she had covered her face fell off and disclosed a countenance of\nincomparable and marvellous beauty, but pale and terrified; for she kept turning her eyes, everywhere she\ncould direct her gaze, with an eagerness that made her look as if she had lost her senses, and so marked\nthat it excited the pity of Dorothea and all who beheld her, though they knew not what caused it. The\ngentleman grasped her firmly by the shoulders, and being so fully occupied with holding her back, he was\n-129\n\nunable to put a hand to his veil which was falling off, as it did at length entirely, and Dorothea, who was\nholding the lady in her arms, raising her eyes saw that he who likewise held her was her husband, Don\nFernando. The instant she recognised him, with a prolonged plaintive cry drawn from the depths of her\nheart, she fell backwards fainting, and but for the barber being close by to catch her in his arms, she\nwould have fallen completely to the ground. The curate at once hastened to uncover her face and throw\nwater on it, and as he did so Don Fernando, for he it was who held the other in his arms, recognised her\nand stood as if death-stricken by the sight; not, however, relaxing his grasp of Luscinda, for it was she\nthat was struggling to release herself from his hold, having recognised Cardenio by his voice, as he had\nrecognised her. Cardenio also heard Dorothea's cry as she fell fainting, and imagining that it came from\nhis Luscinda burst forth in terror from the room, and the first thing he saw was Don Fernando with\nLuscinda in his arms. Don Fernando, too, knew Cardenio at once; and all three, Luscinda, Cardenio, and\nDorothea, stood in silent amazement scarcely knowing what had happened to them.\nThey gazed at one another without speaking, Dorothea at Don Fernando, Don Fernando at Cardenio,\nCardenio at Luscinda, and Luscinda at Cardenio. The first to break silence was Luscinda, who thus\naddressed Don Fernando: \"Leave me, Senor Don Fernando, for the sake of what you owe to yourself; if\nno other reason will induce you, leave me to cling to the wall of which I am the ivy, to the support from\nwhich neither your importunities, nor your threats, nor your promises, nor your gifts have been able to\ndetach me. See how Heaven, by ways strange and hidden from our sight, has brought me face to face with\nmy true husband; and well you know by dear-bought experience that death alone will be able to efface\nhim from my memory. May this plain declaration, then, lead you, as you can do nothing else, to turn your\nlove into rage, your affection into resentment, and so to take my life; for if I yield it up in the presence of\nmy beloved husband I count it well bestowed; it may be by my death he will be convinced that I kept my\nfaith to him to the last moment of life.\"\nMeanwhile Dorothea had come to herself, and had heard Luscinda's words, by means of which she\ndivined who she was; but seeing that Don Fernando did not yet release her or reply to her, summoning up\nher resolution as well as she could she rose and knelt at his feet, and with a flood of bright and touching\ntears addressed him thus:\n\"If, my lord, the beams of that sun that thou holdest eclipsed in thine arms did not dazzle and rob thine\neyes of sight thou wouldst have seen by this time that she who kneels at thy feet is, so long as thou wilt\nhave it so, the unhappy and unfortunate Dorothea. I am that lowly peasant girl whom thou in thy\ngoodness or for thy pleasure wouldst raise high enough to call herself thine; I am she who in the seclusion\nof innocence led a contented life until at the voice of thy importunity, and thy true and tender passion, as\nit seemed, she opened the gates of her modesty and surrendered to thee the keys of her liberty; a gift\nreceived by thee but thanklessly, as is clearly shown by my forced retreat to the place where thou dost\nfind me, and by thy appearance under the circumstances in which I see thee. Nevertheless, I would not\nhave thee suppose that I have come here driven by my shame; it is only grief and sorrow at seeing myself\nforgotten by thee that have led me. It was thy will to make me thine, and thou didst so follow thy will,\nthat now, even though thou repentest, thou canst not help being mine. Bethink thee, my lord, the\nunsurpassable affection I bear thee may compensate for the beauty and noble birth for which thou wouldst\ndesert me. Thou canst not be the fair Luscinda's because thou art mine, nor can she be thine because she\nis Cardenio's; and it will be easier, remember, to bend thy will to love one who adores thee, than to lead\none to love thee who abhors thee now. Thou didst address thyself to my simplicity, thou didst lay siege to\nmy virtue, thou wert not ignorant of my station, well dost thou know how I yielded wholly to thy will;\nthere is no ground or reason for thee to plead deception, and if it be so, as it is, and if thou art a Christian\nas thou art a gentleman, why dost thou by such subterfuges put off making me as happy at last as thou\ndidst at first? And if thou wilt not have me for what I am, thy true and lawful wife, at least take and accept\nme as thy slave, for so long as I am thine I will count myself happy and fortunate. Do not by deserting me\nlet my shame become the talk of the gossips in the streets; make not the old age of my parents miserable;\n-130\n\nfor the loyal services they as faithful vassals have ever rendered thine are not deserving of such a return;\nand if thou thinkest it will debase thy blood to mingle it with mine, reflect that there is little or no nobility\nin the world that has not travelled the same road, and that in illustrious lineages it is not the woman's\nblood that is of account; and, moreover, that true nobility consists in virtue, and if thou art wanting in\nthat, refusing me what in justice thou owest me, then even I have higher claims to nobility than thine. To\nmake an end, senor, these are my last words to thee: whether thou wilt, or wilt not, I am thy wife; witness\nthy words, which must not and ought not to be false, if thou dost pride thyself on that for want of which\nthou scornest me; witness the pledge which thou didst give me, and witness Heaven, which thou thyself\ndidst call to witness the promise thou hadst made me; and if all this fail, thy own conscience will not fail\nto lift up its silent voice in the midst of all thy gaiety, and vindicate the truth of what I say and mar thy\nhighest pleasure and enjoyment.\"\nAll this and more the injured Dorothea delivered with such earnest feeling and such tears that all present,\neven those who came with Don Fernando, were constrained to join her in them. Don Fernando listened to\nher without replying, until, ceasing to speak, she gave way to such sobs and sighs that it must have been a\nheart of brass that was not softened by the sight of so great sorrow. Luscinda stood regarding her with no\nless compassion for her sufferings than admiration for her intelligence and beauty, and would have gone\nto her to say some words of comfort to her, but was prevented by Don Fernando's grasp which held her\nfast. He, overwhelmed with confusion and astonishment, after regarding Dorothea for some moments\nwith a fixed gaze, opened his arms, and, releasing Luscinda, exclaimed:\n\"Thou hast conquered, fair Dorothea, thou hast conquered, for it is impossible to have the heart to deny\nthe united force of so many truths.\"\nLuscinda in her feebleness was on the point of falling to the ground when Don Fernando released her, but\nCardenio, who stood near, having retreated behind Don Fernando to escape recognition, casting fear aside\nand regardless of what might happen, ran forward to support her, and said as he clasped her in his arms,\n\"If Heaven in its compassion is willing to let thee rest at last, mistress of my heart, true, constant, and fair,\nnowhere canst thou rest more safely than in these arms that now receive thee, and received thee before\nwhen fortune permitted me to call thee mine.\"\nAt these words Luscinda looked up at Cardenio, at first beginning to recognise him by his voice and then\nsatisfying herself by her eyes that it was he, and hardly knowing what she did, and heedless of all\nconsiderations of decorum, she flung her arms around his neck and pressing her face close to his, said,\n\"Yes, my dear lord, you are the true master of this your slave, even though adverse fate interpose again,\nand fresh dangers threaten this life that hangs on yours.\"\nA strange sight was this for Don Fernando and those that stood around, filled with surprise at an incident\nso unlooked for. Dorothea fancied that Don Fernando changed colour and looked as though he meant to\ntake vengeance on Cardenio, for she observed him put his hand to his sword; and the instant the idea\nstruck her, with wonderful quickness she clasped him round the knees, and kissing them and holding him\nso as to prevent his moving, she said, while her tears continued to flow, \"What is it thou wouldst do, my\nonly refuge, in this unforeseen event? Thou hast thy wife at thy feet, and she whom thou wouldst have for\nthy wife is in the arms of her husband: reflect whether it will be right for thee, whether it will be possible\nfor thee to undo what Heaven has done, or whether it will be becoming in thee to seek to raise her to be\nthy mate who in spite of every obstacle, and strong in her truth and constancy, is before thine eyes,\nbathing with the tears of love the face and bosom of her lawful husband. For God's sake I entreat of thee,\nfor thine own I implore thee, let not this open manifestation rouse thy anger; but rather so calm it as to\nallow these two lovers to live in peace and quiet without any interference from thee so long as Heaven\npermits them; and in so doing thou wilt prove the generosity of thy lofty noble spirit, and the world shall\nsee that with thee reason has more influence than passion.\"\n-131\n\nAll the time Dorothea was speaking, Cardenio, though he held Luscinda in his arms, never took his eyes\noff Don Fernando, determined, if he saw him make any hostile movement, to try and defend himself and\nresist as best he could all who might assail him, though it should cost him his life. But now Don\nFernando's friends, as well as the curate and the barber, who had been present all the while, not forgetting\nthe worthy Sancho Panza, ran forward and gathered round Don Fernando, entreating him to have regard\nfor the tears of Dorothea, and not suffer her reasonable hopes to be disappointed, since, as they firmly\nbelieved, what she said was but the truth; and bidding him observe that it was not, as it might seem, by\naccident, but by a special disposition of Providence that they had all met in a place where no one could\nhave expected a meeting. And the curate bade him remember that only death could part Luscinda from\nCardenio; that even if some sword were to separate them they would think their death most happy; and\nthat in a case that admitted of no remedy his wisest course was, by conquering and putting a constraint\nupon himself, to show a generous mind, and of his own accord suffer these two to enjoy the happiness\nHeaven had granted them. He bade him, too, turn his eyes upon the beauty of Dorothea and he would see\nthat few if any could equal much less excel her; while to that beauty should be added her modesty and the\nsurpassing love she bore him. But besides all this, he reminded him that if he prided himself on being a\ngentleman and a Christian, he could not do otherwise than keep his plighted word; and that in doing so he\nwould obey God and meet the approval of all sensible people, who know and recognised it to be the\nprivilege of beauty, even in one of humble birth, provided virtue accompany it, to be able to raise itself to\nthe level of any rank, without any slur upon him who places it upon an equality with himself; and\nfurthermore that when the potent sway of passion asserts itself, so long as there be no mixture of sin in it,\nhe is not to be blamed who gives way to it.\nTo be brief, they added to these such other forcible arguments that Don Fernando's manly heart, being\nafter all nourished by noble blood, was touched, and yielded to the truth which, even had he wished it, he\ncould not deny; and he showed his submission, and acceptance of the good advice that had been offered\nto him, by stooping down and embracing Dorothea, saying to her, \"Rise, dear lady, it is not right that\nwhat I hold in my heart should be kneeling at my feet; and if until now I have shown no sign of what I\nown, it may have been by Heaven's decree in order that, seeing the constancy with which you love me, I\nmay learn to value you as you deserve. What I entreat of you is that you reproach me not with my\ntransgression and grievous wrong-doing; for the same cause and force that drove me to make you mine\nimpelled me to struggle against being yours; and to prove this, turn and look at the eyes of the now happy\nLuscinda, and you will see in them an excuse for all my errors: and as she has found and gained the object\nof her desires, and I have found in you what satisfies all my wishes, may she live in peace and\ncontentment as many happy years with her Cardenio, as on my knees I pray Heaven to allow me to live\nwith my Dorothea;\" and with these words he once more embraced her and pressed his face to hers with so\nmuch tenderness that he had to take great heed to keep his tears from completing the proof of his love and\nrepentance in the sight of all. Not so Luscinda, and Cardenio, and almost all the others, for they shed so\nmany tears, some in their own happiness, some at that of the others, that one would have supposed a\nheavy calamity had fallen upon them all. Even Sancho Panza was weeping; though afterwards he said he\nonly wept because he saw that Dorothea was not as he fancied the queen Micomicona, of whom he\nexpected such great favours. Their wonder as well as their weeping lasted some time, and then Cardenio\nand Luscinda went and fell on their knees before Don Fernando, returning him thanks for the favour he\nhad rendered them in language so grateful that he knew not how to answer them, and raising them up\nembraced them with every mark of affection and courtesy.\nHe then asked Dorothea how she had managed to reach a place so far removed from her own home, and\nshe in a few fitting words told all that she had previously related to Cardenio, with which Don Fernando\nand his companions were so delighted that they wished the story had been longer; so charmingly did\nDorothea describe her misadventures. When she had finished Don Fernando recounted what had befallen\nhim in the city after he had found in Luscinda's bosom the paper in which she declared that she was\nCardenio's wife, and never could be his. He said he meant to kill her, and would have done so had he not\n-132\n\nbeen prevented by her parents, and that he quitted the house full of rage and shame, and resolved to\navenge himself when a more convenient opportunity should offer. The next day he learned that Luscinda\nhad disappeared from her father's house, and that no one could tell whither she had gone. Finally, at the\nend of some months he ascertained that she was in a convent and meant to remain there all the rest of her\nlife, if she were not to share it with Cardenio; and as soon as he had learned this, taking these three\ngentlemen as his companions, he arrived at the place where she was, but avoided speaking to her, fearing\nthat if it were known he was there stricter precautions would be taken in the convent; and watching a time\nwhen the porter's lodge was open he left two to guard the gate, and he and the other entered the convent\nin quest of Luscinda, whom they found in the cloisters in conversation with one of the nuns, and carrying\nher off without giving her time to resist, they reached a place with her where they provided themselves\nwith what they required for taking her away; all which they were able to do in complete safety, as the\nconvent was in the country at a considerable distance from the city. He added that when Luscinda found\nherself in his power she lost all consciousness, and after returning to herself did nothing but weep and\nsigh without speaking a word; and thus in silence and tears they reached that inn, which for him was\nreaching heaven where all the mischances of earth are over and at an end.\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\nIN WHICH IS CONTINUED THE STORY OF THE FAMOUS PRINCESS MICOMICONA, WITH\nOTHER DROLL ADVENTURES\nTo all this Sancho listened with no little sorrow at heart to see how his hopes of dignity were fading away\nand vanishing in smoke, and how the fair Princess Micomicona had turned into Dorothea, and the giant\ninto Don Fernando, while his master was sleeping tranquilly, totally unconscious of all that had come to\npass. Dorothea was unable to persuade herself that her present happiness was not all a dream; Cardenio\nwas in a similar state of mind, and Luscinda's thoughts ran in the same direction. Don Fernando gave\nthanks to Heaven for the favour shown to him and for having been rescued from the intricate labyrinth in\nwhich he had been brought so near the destruction of his good name and of his soul; and in short\neverybody in the inn was full of contentment and satisfaction at the happy issue of such a complicated\nand hopeless business. The curate as a sensible man made sound reflections upon the whole affair, and\ncongratulated each upon his good fortune; but the one that was in the highest spirits and good humour\nwas the landlady, because of the promise Cardenio and the curate had given her to pay for all the losses\nand damage she had sustained through Don Quixote's means. Sancho, as has been already said, was the\nonly one who was distressed, unhappy, and dejected; and so with a long face he went in to his master,\nwho had just awoke, and said to him:\n\"Sir Regretful Appearance Countenance, your worship may as well sleep on as much as you like, without\ntroubling yourself about killing any giant or restoring her kingdom to the princess; for that is all over and\nsettled now.\"\n\"I should think it was,\" replied Don Quixote, \"for I have had the most prodigious and stupendous battle\nwith the giant that I ever remember having had all the days of my life; and with one back-stroke-swish!--I\nbrought his head tumbling to the ground, and so much blood gushed forth from him that it ran in rivulets\nover the earth like water.\"\n\"Like red wine, your worship had better say,\" replied Sancho; \"for I would have you know, if you don't\nknow it, that the dead giant is a hacked wine-skin, and the blood four-and-twenty gallons of red wine that\nit had in its belly, and the cut-off head is the bitch that bore me; and the devil take it all.\"\n\"What art thou talking about, fool?\" said Don Quixote; \"art thou in thy senses?\"\n-133\n\n\"Let your worship get up,\" said Sancho, \"and you will see the nice business you have made of it, and\nwhat we have to pay; and you will see the queen turned into a private lady called Dorothea, and other\nthings that will astonish you, if you understand them.\"\n\"I shall not be surprised at anything of the kind,\" returned Don Quixote; \"for if thou dost remember the\nlast time we were here I told thee that everything that happened here was a matter of enchantment, and it\nwould be no wonder if it were the same now.\"\n\"I could believe all that,\" replied Sancho, \"if my blanketing was the same sort of thing also; only it\nwasn't, but real and genuine; for I saw the landlord, Who is here to-day, holding one end of the blanket\nand jerking me up to the skies very neatly and smartly, and with as much laughter as strength; and when it\ncomes to be a case of knowing people, I hold for my part, simple and sinner as I am, that there is no\nenchantment about it at all, but a great deal of bruising and bad luck.\"\n\"Well, well, God will give a remedy,\" said Don Quixote; \"hand me my clothes and let me go out, for I\nwant to see these transformations and things thou speakest of.\"\nSancho fetched him his clothes; and while he was dressing, the curate gave Don Fernando and the others\npresent an account of Don Quixote's madness and of the stratagem they had made use of to withdraw him\nfrom that Pena Pobre where he fancied himself stationed because of his lady's scorn. He described to\nthem also nearly all the adventures that Sancho had mentioned, at which they marvelled and laughed not a\nlittle, thinking it, as all did, the strangest form of madness a crazy intellect could be capable of. But now,\nthe curate said, that the lady Dorothea's good fortune prevented her from proceeding with their purpose, it\nwould be necessary to devise or discover some other way of getting him home.\nCardenio proposed to carry out the scheme they had begun, and suggested that Luscinda would act and\nsupport Dorothea's part sufficiently well.\n\"No,\" said Don Fernando, \"that must not be, for I want Dorothea to follow out this idea of hers; and if the\nworthy gentleman's village is not very far off, I shall be happy if I can do anything for his relief.\"\n\"It is not more than two days' journey from this,\" said the curate.\n\"Even if it were more,\" said Don Fernando, \"I would gladly travel so far for the sake of doing so good a\nwork.\n\"At this moment Don Quixote came out in full panoply, with Mambrino's helmet, all dinted as it was, on\nhis head, his buckler on his arm, and leaning on his staff or pike. The strange figure he presented filled\nDon Fernando and the rest with amazement as they contemplated his lean yellow face half a league long,\nhis armour of all sorts, and the solemnity of his deportment. They stood silent waiting to see what he\nwould say, and he, fixing his eyes on the air Dorothea, addressed her with great gravity and composure:\n\"I am informed, fair lady, by my squire here that your greatness has been annihilated and your being\nabolished, since, from a queen and lady of high degree as you used to be, you have been turned into a\nprivate maiden. If this has been done by the command of the magician king your father, through fear that\nI should not afford you the aid you need and are entitled to, I may tell you he did not know and does not\nknow half the mass, and was little versed in the annals of chivalry; for, if he had read and gone through\nthem as attentively and deliberately as I have, he would have found at every turn that knights of less\nrenown than mine have accomplished things more difficult: it is no great matter to kill a whelp of a giant,\nhowever arrogant he may be; for it is not many hours since I myself was engaged with one, and-I will not\nspeak of it, that they may not say I am lying; time, however, that reveals all, will tell the tale when we\n-134\n\nleast expect it.\"\n\"You were engaged with a couple of wine-skins, and not a giant,\" said the landlord at this; but Don\nFernando told him to hold his tongue and on no account interrupt Don Quixote, who continued, \"I say in\nconclusion, high and disinherited lady, that if your father has brought about this metamorphosis in your\nperson for the reason I have mentioned, you ought not to attach any importance to it; for there is no peril\non earth through which my sword will not force a way, and with it, before many days are over, I will\nbring your enemy's head to the ground and place on yours the crown of your kingdom.\"\nDon Quixote said no more, and waited for the reply of the princess, who aware of Don Fernando's\ndetermination to carry on the deception until Don Quixote had been conveyed to his home, with great\nease of manner and gravity made answer, \"Whoever told you, valiant Knight of Regretful Appearance,\nthat I had undergone any change or transformation did not tell you the truth, for I am the same as I was\nyesterday. It is true that certain strokes of good fortune, that have given me more than I could have hoped\nfor, have made some alteration in me; but I have not therefore ceased to be what I was before, or to\nentertain the same desire I have had all through of availing myself of the might of your valiant and\ninvincible arm. And so, senor, let your goodness reinstate the father that begot me in your good opinion,\nand be assured that he was a wise and prudent man, since by his craft he found out such a sure and easy\nway of remedying my misfortune; for I believe, senor, that had it not been for you I should never have lit\nupon the good fortune I now possess; and in this I am saying what is perfectly true; as most of these\ngentlemen who are present can fully testify. All that remains is to set out on our journey to-morrow, for\nto-day we could not make much way; and for the rest of the happy result I am looking forward to, I trust\nto God and the valour of your heart.\"\nSo said the sprightly Dorothea, and on hearing her Don Quixote turned to Sancho, and said to him, with\nan angry air, \"I declare now, little Sancho, thou art the greatest little villain in Spain. Say, thief and\nvagabond, hast thou not just now told me that this princess had been turned into a maiden called\nDorothea, and that the head which I am persuaded I cut off from a giant was the bitch that bore thee, and\nother nonsense that put me in the greatest perplexity I have ever been in all my life? I vow\" (and here he\nlooked to heaven and ground his teeth) \"I have a mind to play the mischief with thee, in a way that will\nteach sense for the future to all lying squires of knights-errant in the world.\"\n\"Let your worship be calm, senor,\" returned Sancho, \"for it may well be that I have been mistaken as to\nthe change of the lady princess Micomicona; but as to the giant's head, or at least as to the piercing of the\nwine-skins, and the blood being red wine, I make no mistake, as sure as there is a God; because the\nwounded skins are there at the head of your worship's bed, and the wine has made a lake of the room; if\nnot you will see when the eggs come to be fried; I mean when his worship the landlord calls for all the\ndamages: for the rest, I am heartily glad that her ladyship the queen is as she was, for it concerns me as\nmuch as anyone.\"\n\"I tell thee again, Sancho, thou art a fool,\" said Don Quixote; \"forgive me, and that will do.\"\n\"That will do indeed,\" said Don Fernando; \"let us say no more about it; and as her ladyship the princess\nproposes to set out to-morrow because it is too late to-day, so be it, and we will pass the night in pleasant\nconversation, and to-morrow we will all accompany Senor Don Quixote; for we wish to witness the\nvaliant and unparalleled achievements he is about to perform in the course of this mighty enterprise which\nhe has undertaken.\"\n\"It is I who shall wait upon and accompany you,\" said Don Quixote; \"and I am much gratified by the\nfavour that is bestowed upon me, and the good opinion entertained of me, which I shall strive to justify or\nit shall cost me my life, or even more, if it can possibly cost me more.\"\n-135\n\n. . . And so they supped in high enjoyment, which was increased when they observed Don Quixote leave\noff eating, and, moved by an impulse like that which made him deliver himself at such length when he\nsupped with the goatherds, begin to address them:\n\"Verily, gentlemen, if we reflect upon it, great and marvellous are the things they see, who make\nprofession of the order of knight-errantry. Say, what being is there in this world, who entering the gate of\nthis castle at this moment, and seeing us as we are here, would suppose or imagine us to be what we are?\nWho would say that this lady who is beside me was the great queen that we all know her to be, or that I\nam that Knight of Regretful Appearance, trumpeted far and wide by the mouth of Fame? Now, there can\nbe no doubt that this art and calling surpasses all those that mankind has invented, and is the more\ndeserving of being held in honour in proportion as it is the more exposed to peril. Away with those who\nassert that letters have the preeminence over arms; I will tell them, whosoever they may be, that they\nknow not what they say. For the reason which such persons commonly assign, and upon which they\nchiefly rest, is, that the labours of the mind are greater than those of the body, and that arms give\nemployment to the body alone; as if the calling were a porter's trade, for which nothing more is required\nthan sturdy strength; or as if, in what we who profess them call arms, there were not included acts of\nvigour for the execution of which high intelligence is requisite; or as if the soul of the warrior, when he\nhas an army, or the defence of a city under his care, did not exert itself as much by mind as by body. Nay;\nsee whether by bodily strength it be possible to learn or divine the intentions of the enemy, his plans,\nstratagems, or obstacles, or to ward off impending mischief; for all these are the work of the mind, and in\nthem the body has no share whatever. Since, therefore, arms have need of the mind, as much as letters, let\nus see now which of the two minds, that of the man of letters or that of the warrior, has most to do; and\nthis will be seen by the end and goal that each seeks to attain; for that purpose is the more estimable\nwhich has for its aim the nobler object. The end and goal of letters--I am not speaking now of divine\nletters, the aim of which is to raise and direct the soul to Heaven; for with an end so infinite no other can\nbe compared--I speak of human letters, the end of which is to establish distributive justice, give to every\nman that which is his, and see and take care that good laws are observed: an end undoubtedly noble, lofty,\nand deserving of high praise, but not such as should be given to that sought by arms, which have for their\nend and object peace, the greatest boon that men can desire in this life. The first good news the world and\nmankind received was that which the angels announced on the night that was our day, when they sang in\nthe air, 'Glory to God in the highest, and peace on earth to men of good-will;' and the salutation which\nthe great Master of heaven and earth taught his disciples and chosen followers when they entered any\nhouse, was to say, 'Peace be on this house;' and many other times he said to them, 'My peace I give unto\nyou, my peace I leave you, peace be with you;' a jewel and a precious gift given and left by such a hand:\na jewel without which there can be no happiness either on earth or in heaven. This peace is the true end of\nwar; and war is only another name for arms. This, then, being admitted, that the end of war is peace, and\nthat so far it has the advantage of the end of letters, let us turn to the bodily labours of the man of letters,\nand those of him who follows the profession of arms, and see which are the greater.\"\nDon Quixote delivered his discourse in such a manner and in such correct language, that for the time\nbeing he made it impossible for any of his hearers to consider him a madman; on the contrary, as they\nwere mostly gentlemen, to whom arms are an appurtenance by birth, they listened to him with great\npleasure as he continued: \"Here, then, I say is what the student has to undergo; first of all poverty: not\nthat all are poor, but to put the case as strongly as possible: and when I have said that he endures poverty,\nI think nothing more need be said about his hard fortune, for he who is poor has no share of the good\nthings of life. This poverty he suffers from in various ways, hunger, or cold, or nakedness, or all together;\nbut for all that it is not so extreme but that he gets something to eat, though it may be at somewhat\nunseasonable hours and from the leavings of the rich; for the greatest misery of the student is what they\nthemselves call 'going out for soup,' and there is always some neighbour's brazier or hearth for them,\nwhich, if it does not warm, at least tempers the cold to them, and lastly, they sleep comfortably at night\nunder a roof. I will not go into other particulars, as for example want of shirts, and no superabundance of\n-136\n\nshoes, thin and threadbare garments, and gorging themselves to surfeit in their voracity when good luck\nhas treated them to a banquet of some sort. By this road that I have described, rough and hard, stumbling\nhere, falling there, getting up again to fall again, they reach the rank they desire, and that once attained,\nwe have seen many who have passed these Syrtes and Scyllas and Charybdises, as if borne flying on the\nwings of favouring fortune; we have seen them, I say, ruling and governing the world from a chair, their\nhunger turned into satiety, their cold into comfort, their nakedness into fine raiment, their sleep on a mat\ninto repose in holland and damask, the justly earned reward of their virtue; but, contrasted and compared\nwith what the warrior undergoes, all they have undergone falls far short of it, as I am now about to show.\"\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\nWHICH TREATS OF THE CURIOUS DISCOURSE DON QUIXOTE DELIVERED ON ARMS AND\nLETTERS\nContinuing his discourse Don Quixote said: \"As we began in the student's case with poverty and its\naccompaniments, let us see now if the soldier is richer, and we shall find that in poverty itself there is no\none poorer; for he is dependent on his miserable pay, which comes late or never, or else on what he can\nplunder, seriously imperilling his life and conscience; and sometimes his nakedness will be so great that a\nslashed doublet serves him for uniform and shirt, and in the depth of winter he has to defend himself\nagainst the inclemency of the weather in the open field with nothing better than the breath of his mouth,\nwhich I need not say, coming from an empty place, must come out cold, contrary to the laws of nature. To\nbe sure he looks forward to the approach of night to make up for all these discomforts on the bed that\nawaits him, which, unless by some fault of his, never sins by being over narrow, for he can easily measure\nout on the ground as he likes, and roll himself about in it to his heart's content without any fear of the\nsheets slipping away from him. Then, after all this, suppose the day and hour for taking his degree in his\ncalling to have come; suppose the day of battle to have arrived, when they invest him with the doctor's\ncap made of lint, to mend some bullet-hole, perhaps, that has gone through his temples, or left him with a\ncrippled arm or leg. Or if this does not happen, and merciful Heaven watches over him and keeps him safe\nand sound, it may be he will be in the same poverty he was in before, and he must go through more\nengagements and more battles, and come victorious out of all before he betters himself; but miracles of\nthat sort are seldom seen. For tell me, sirs, if you have ever reflected upon it, by how much do those who\nhave gained by war fall short of the number of those who have perished in it? No doubt you will reply\nthat there can be no comparison, that the dead cannot be numbered, while the living who have been\nrewarded may be summed up with three figures. All which is the reverse in the case of men of letters; for\nby skirts, to say nothing of sleeves, they all find means of support; so that though the soldier has more to\nendure, his reward is much less. But against all this it may be urged that it is easier to reward two\nthousand soldiers, for the former may be remunerated by giving them places, which must perforce be\nconferred upon men of their calling, while the latter can only be recompensed out of the very property of\nthe master they serve; but this impossibility only strengthens my argument.\n\"Putting this, however, aside, for it is a puzzling question for which it is difficult to find a solution, let us\nreturn to the superiority of arms over letters, a matter still undecided, so many are the arguments put\nforward on each side; for besides those I have mentioned, letters say that without them arms cannot\nmaintain themselves, for war, too, has its laws and is governed by them, and laws belong to the domain of\nletters and men of letters. To this arms make answer that without them laws cannot be maintained, for by\narms states are defended, kingdoms preserved, cities protected, roads made safe, seas cleared of pirates;\nand, in short, if it were not for them, states, kingdoms, monarchies, cities, ways by sea and land would be\nexposed to the violence and confusion which war brings with it, so long as it lasts and is free to make use\nof its privileges and powers. And then it is plain that whatever costs most is valued and deserves to be\nvalued most. To attain to eminence in letters costs a man time, watching, hunger, nakedness, headaches,\nindigestions, and other things of the sort, some of which I have already referred to. But for a man to come\n-137\n\nin the ordinary course of things to be a good soldier costs him all the student suffers, and in an\nincomparably higher degree, for at every step he runs the risk of losing his life. For what dread of want or\npoverty that can reach or harass the student can compare with what the soldier feels, who finds himself\nbeleaguered in some stronghold mounting guard in some ravelin or knight, knows that the enemy is\npushing a mine towards the post where he is stationed, and cannot under any circumstances retire or fly\nfrom the imminent danger that threatens him? All he can do is to inform his captain of what is going on so\nthat he may try to remedy it by a counter-mine, and then stand his ground in fear and expectation of the\nmoment when he will fly up to the clouds without wings and descend into the deep against his will. And\nif this seems a trifling risk, let us see whether it is equalled or surpassed by the encounter of two galleys\nstem to stem, in the midst of the open sea, locked and entangled one with the other, when the soldier has\nno more standing room than two feet of the plank of the spur; and yet, though he sees before him\nthreatening him as many ministers of death as there are cannon of the foe pointed at him, not a lance\nlength from his body, and sees too that with the first heedless step he will go down to visit the\nprofundities of Neptune's bosom, still with dauntless heart, urged on by honour that nerves him, he makes\nhimself a target for all that musketry, and struggles to cross that narrow path to the enemy's ship. And\nwhat is still more marvellous, no sooner has one gone down into the depths he will never rise from till the\nend of the world, than another takes his place; and if he too falls into the sea that waits for him like an\nenemy, another and another will succeed him without a moment's pause between their deaths: courage\nand daring the greatest that all the chances of war can show. Happy the blest ages that knew not the dread\nfury of those devilish engines of artillery, whose inventor I am persuaded is in hell receiving the reward\nof his diabolical invention, by which he made it easy for a base and cowardly arm to take the life of a\ngallant gentleman; and that, when he knows not how or whence, in the height of the ardour and\nenthusiasm that fire and animate brave hearts, there should come some random bullet, discharged perhaps\nby one who fled in terror at the flash when he fired off his accursed machine, which in an instant puts an\nend to the projects and cuts off the life of one who deserved to live for ages to come. And thus when I\nreflect on this, I am almost tempted to say that in my heart I repent of having adopted this profession of\nknight-errant in so detestable an age as we live in now; for though no peril can make me fear, still it gives\nme some uneasiness to think that powder and lead may rob me of the opportunity of making myself\nfamous and renowned throughout the known earth by the might of my arm and the edge of my sword. But\nHeaven's will be done; if I succeed in my attempt I shall be all the more honoured, as I have faced greater\ndangers than the knights-errant of yore exposed themselves to.\"\nAll this lengthy discourse Don Quixote delivered while the others supped, forgetting to raise a morsel to\nhis lips, though Sancho more than once told him to eat his supper, as he would have time enough\nafterwards to say all he wanted. It excited fresh pity in those who had heard him to see a man of\napparently sound sense, and with rational views on every subject he discussed, so hopelessly wanting in\nall, when his wretched unlucky chivalry was in question. The curate told him he was quite right in all he\nhad said in favour of arms, and that he himself, though a man of letters and a graduate, was of the same\nopinion.\n[Chapters XXXIX-XLII and part of the next chapter are omitted]\nCHAPTER XLIII.\nWHICH DEALS WITH FURTHER HAPPENINGS AT THE INN AND OTHER MATTERS WORTHY\nOF ATTENTION\nThey finished their supper, the cloth was removed, and the hostess, her daughter, and Maritornes were\ngetting Don Quixote of La Mancha's garret ready, in which it was arranged that the women were to be\nquartered by themselves for the night; and as now almost two-thirds of the night were past, they resolved\nto retire to rest for the remainder of it. Don Quixote offered to mount guard over the castle lest they\n-138\n\nshould be attacked by some giant or other malevolent scoundrel, covetous of the great treasure of beauty\nthe castle contained. Sancho Panza alone was fuming at the lateness of the hour for retiring to rest; and he\nof all was the one that made himself most comfortable, as he stretched himself on the trappings of his ass,\nwhich, as will be told farther on, cost him so dear.\nThe ladies, then, having retired to their chamber, and the others having disposed themselves with as little\ndiscomfort as they could, Don Quixote sallied out of the inn to act as sentinel of the castle as he had\npromised. The only persons not asleep were the landlady's daughter and her servant Maritornes, who,\nknowing the weak point of Don Quixote's humour, and that he was outside the inn mounting guard in\narmour and on horseback, resolved, the pair of them, to play some trick upon him, or at any rate to amuse\nthemselves for a while by listening to his nonsense.\nAs it so happened there was not a window in the whole inn that looked outwards except a hole in the wall\nof a straw-loft through which they used to throw out the straw. At this hole the two demi-damsels posted\nthemselves, and observed Don Quixote on his horse, leaning on his pike and from time to time sending\nforth such deep and doleful sighs, that he seemed to pluck up his soul by the roots with each of them; and\nthey could hear him, too, saying in a soft, tender, loving tone, \"Oh my lady Dulcinea del Toboso,\nperfection of all beauty, summit and crown of discretion, treasure house of grace, depositary of virtue,\nand finally, ideal of all that is good, honourable, and delectable in this world! What is thy grace doing\nnow? Art thou, perchance, mindful of thy enslaved knight who of his own free will hath exposed himself\nto so great perils, and all to serve thee? Give me tidings of her, oh luminary of the three faces! Perhaps at\nthis moment, envious of hers, thou art regarding her, either as she paces to and fro some gallery of her\nsumptuous palaces, or leans over some balcony, meditating how, whilst preserving her purity and\ngreatness, she may mitigate the tortures this wretched heart of mine endures for her sake, what glory\nshould recompense my sufferings, what repose my toil, and lastly what death my life, and what reward\nmy services? And thou, oh sun, that art now doubtless harnessing thy steeds in haste to rise betimes and\ncome forth to see my lady; when thou seest her I entreat of thee to salute her on my behalf: but have a\ncare, when thou shalt see her and salute her, that thou kiss not her face; for I shall be more jealous of thee\nthan thou wert of that light-footed ingrate that made thee sweat and run so on the plains of Thessaly, or on\nthe banks of the Peneus (for I do not exactly recollect where it was thou didst run on that occasion) in thy\njealousy and love.\"\nDon Quixote had got so far in his pathetic speech when the landlady's daughter began to signal to him,\nsaying, \"Senor, come over here, please.\"\nAt these signals and voice Don Quixote turned his head and saw by the light of the moon, which then was\nin its full splendour, that some one was calling to him from the hole in the wall, which seemed to him to\nbe a window, and what is more, with a gilt grating, as rich castles, such as he believed the inn to be, ought\nto have; and it immediately suggested itself to his imagination that, as on the former occasion, the fair\ndamsel, the daughter of the lady of the castle, overcome by love for him, was once more endeavouring to\nwin his affections; and with this idea, not to show himself discourteous, or ungrateful, he turned\nRocinante's head and approached the hole, and as he perceived the two wenches he said:\n\"I pity you, beauteous lady, that you should have directed your thoughts of love to a quarter from whence\nit is impossible that such a return can be made to you as is due to your great merit and gentle birth, for\nwhich you must not blame this unhappy knight-errant whom love renders incapable of submission to any\nother than her whom, the first moment his eyes beheld her, he made absolute mistress of his soul. Forgive\nme, noble lady, and retire to your apartment, and do not, by any further declaration of your passion,\ncompel me to show myself more ungrateful; and if, of the love you bear me, you should find that there is\nanything else in my power wherein I can gratify you, provided it be not love itself, demand it of me; for I\nswear to you by that sweet absent enemy of mine to grant it this instant, though it be that you require of\n-139\n\nme a lock of Medusa's hair, which was all snakes, or even the very beams of the sun shut up in a vial.\"\n\"My mistress wants nothing of that sort, sir knight,\" said Maritornes at this.\n\"What then, discreet dame, is it that your mistress wants?\" replied Don Quixote.\n\"Only one of your fair hands,\" said Maritornes, \"to enable her to vent over it the great passion passion\nwhich has brought her to this loophole, so much to the risk of her honour; for if the lord her father had\nheard her, the least slice he would cut off her would be her ear.\"\n\"I should like to see that tried,\" said Don Quixote; \"but he had better beware of that, if he does not want\nto meet the most disastrous end that ever father in the world met for having laid hands on the tender limbs\nof a love-stricken daughter.\"\nMaritornes felt sure that Don Quixote would present the hand she had asked, and making up her mind\nwhat to do, she got down from the hole and went into the stable, where she took the halter of Sancho\nPanza's ass, and in all haste returned to the hole, just as Don Quixote had planted himself standing on\nRocinante's saddle in order to reach the grated window where he supposed the lovelorn damsel to be; and\ngiving her his hand, he said, \"Lady, take this hand, or rather this scourge of the evil-doers of the earth;\ntake, I say, this hand which no other hand of woman has ever touched, not even hers who has complete\npossession of my entire body. I present it to you, not that you may kiss it, but that you may observe the\ncontexture of the sinews, the close network of the muscles, the breadth and capacity of the veins, whence\nyou may infer what must be the strength of the arm that has such a hand.\"\n\"That we shall see presently,\" said Maritornes, and making a running knot on the halter, she passed it\nover his wrist and coming down from the hole tied the other end very firmly to the bolt of the door of the\nstraw-loft.\nDon Quixote, feeling the roughness of the rope on his wrist, exclaimed, \"Your grace seems to be grating\nrather than caressing my hand; treat it not so harshly, for it is not to blame for the offence my resolution\nhas given you, nor is it just to wreak all your vengeance on so small a part; remember that one who loves\nso well should not revenge herself so cruelly.\"\nBut there was nobody now to listen to these words of Don Quixote's, for as soon as Maritornes had tied\nhim she and the other made off, ready to die with laughing, leaving him fastened in such a way that it was\nimpossible for him to release himself.\nHe was, as has been said, standing on Rocinante, with his arm passed through the hole and his wrist tied\nto the bolt of the door, and in mighty fear and dread of being left hanging by the arm if Rocinante were to\nstir one side or the other; so he did not dare to make the least movement, although from the patience and\nimperturbable disposition of Rocinante, he had good reason to expect that he would stand without\nbudging for a whole century. Finding himself fast, then, and that the ladies had retired, he began to fancy\nthat all this was done by enchantment, as on the former occasion when in that same castle that enchanted\nMoor of a mule-driver had belaboured him; and he cursed in his heart his own want of sense and\njudgment in venturing to enter the castle again, after having come off so badly the first time; it being a\nsettled point with knights-errant that when they have tried an adventure, and have not succeeded in it, it is\na sign that it is not reserved for them but for others, and that therefore they need not try it again.\nNevertheless he pulled his arm to see if he could release himself, but it had been made so fast that all his\nefforts were in vain. It is true he pulled it gently lest Rocinante should move, but try as he might to seat\nhimself in the saddle, he had nothing for it but to stand upright or pull his hand off. Then it was he wished\nfor the sword of Amadis, against which no enchantment whatever had any power; then he cursed his ill\n-140\n\nfortune; then he magnified the loss the world would sustain by his absence while he remained there\nenchanted, for that he believed he was beyond all doubt; then he once more took to thinking of his\nbeloved Dulcinea del Toboso; then he called to his worthy squire Sancho Panza, who, buried in sleep and\nstretched upon the pack-saddle of his ass, was oblivious, at that moment, of the mother that bore him;\nthen he called upon the sages Lirgandeo and Alquife to come to his aid; then he invoked his good friend\nUrganda to succour him; and then, at last, morning found him in such a state of desperation and\nperplexity that he was bellowing like a bull, for he had no hope that day would bring any relief to his\nsuffering, which he believed would last for ever, inasmuch as he was enchanted; and of this he was\nconvinced by seeing that Rocinante never stirred, much or little, and he felt persuaded that he and his\nhorse were to remain in this state, without eating or drinking or sleeping, until the malign influence of the\nstars was overpast, or until some other more sage enchanter should disenchant him.\nBut he was very much deceived in this conclusion, for daylight had hardly begun to appear when there\ncame up to the inn four men on horseback, well equipped and accoutred, with firelocks across their\nsaddle-bows. They called out and knocked loudly at the gate of the inn, which was still shut; on seeing\nwhich, Don Quixote, even there where he was, did not forget to act as sentinel, and said in a loud and\nimperious tone, \"Knights, or squires, or whatever ye be, ye have no right to knock at the gates of this\ncastle; for it is plain enough that they who are within are either asleep, or else are not in the habit of\nthrowing open the fortress until the sun's rays are spread over the whole surface of the earth. Withdraw to\na distance, and wait till it is broad daylight, and then we shall see whether it will be proper or not to open\nto you.\"\n\"What the devil fortress or castle is this,\" said one, \"to make us stand on such ceremony? If you are the\ninnkeeper bid them open to us; we are travellers who only want to feed our horses and go on, for we are\nin haste.\"\n\"Do you think, gentlemen, that I look like an innkeeper?\" said Don Quixote.\n\"I don't know what you look like,\" replied the other; \"but I know that you are talking nonsense when you\ncall this inn a castle.\"\n\"A castle it is,\" returned Don Quixote, \"nay, more, one of the best in this whole province, and it has\nwithin it people who have had the sceptre in the hand and the crown on the head.\"\n\"It would be better if it were the other way,\" said the traveller, \"the sceptre on the head and the crown in\nthe hand; but if so, may be there is within some company of players, with whom it is a common thing to\nhave those crowns and sceptres you speak of; for in such a small inn as this, and where such silence is\nkept, I do not believe any people entitled to crowns and sceptres can have taken up their quarters.\"\n\"You know but little of the world,\" returned Don Quixote, \"since you are ignorant of what commonly\noccurs in knight-errantry.\"\nBut the comrades of the spokesman, growing weary of the dialogue with Don Quixote, renewed their\nknocks with great vehemence, so much so that the host, and not only he but everybody in the inn, awoke,\nand he got up to ask who knocked. It happened at this moment that one of the horses of the four who were\nseeking admittance went to smell Rocinante, who melancholy, dejected, and with drooping ears stood\nmotionless, supporting his sorely stretched master; and as he was, after all, flesh, though he looked as if\nhe were made of wood, he could not help giving way and in return smelling the one who had come to\noffer him attentions. But he had hardly moved at all when Don Quixote lost his footing; and slipping off\nthe saddle, he would have come to the ground, but for being suspended by the arm, which caused him\nsuch agony that he believed either his wrist would be cut through or his arm torn off; and he hung so near\n-141\n\nthe ground that he could just touch it with his feet, which was all the worse for him; for, finding how little\nwas wanted to enable him to plant his feet firmly, he struggled and stretched himself as much as he could\nto gain a footing; just like those undergoing the torture of the strappado, when they are fixed at \"touch\nand no touch,\" who aggravate their own sufferings by their violent efforts to stretch themselves, deceived\nby the hope which makes them fancy that with a very little more they will reach the ground.\nCHAPTER XLIV.\nIN WHICH ARE CONTINUED THE UNHEARD-OF ADVENTURES OF THE INN\nSo loud, in fact, were the shouts of Don Quixote, that the landlord opening the gate of the inn in all haste,\ncame out in dismay, and ran to see who was uttering such cries, and those who were outside joined him.\nMaritornes, who had been by this time roused up by the same outcry, suspecting what it was, ran to the\nloft and, without anyone seeing her, untied the halter by which Don Quixote was suspended, and down he\ncame to the ground in the sight of the landlord and the travellers, who approaching asked him what was\nthe matter with him that he shouted so. He without replying a word took the rope off his wrist, and rising\nto his feet leaped upon Rocinante, braced his buckler on his arm, put his lance in rest, and making a\nconsiderable circuit of the plain came back at a half-gallop exclaiming:\n\"Whoever shall say that I have been enchanted with just cause, provided my lady the Princess\nMicomicona grants me permission to do so, I give him the lie, challenge him and defy him to single\ncombat.\"\nThe newly arrived travellers were amazed at the words of Don Quixote; but the landlord removed their\nsurprise by telling them who he was, and not to mind him as he was out of his senses. And so they paid\nno more attention to him but went into the inn. Don Quixote, when he saw that not one of the four\ntravellers took any notice of him or replied to his challenge, was furious and ready to die with indignation\nand wrath; and if he could have found in the ordinances of chivalry that it was lawful for a knight-errant\nto undertake or engage in another enterprise, when he had plighted his word and faith not to involve\nhimself in any until he had made an end of the one to which he was pledged, he would have attacked the\nwhole of them., and would have made them return an answer in spite of themselves.\nBy this time those in the inn were awake and they gathered around the landlord to welcome the new\narrivals. While they were doing so, they heard a loud outcry at the gate of the inn, the cause of which was\nthat two other guests who had passed the night there, seeing everybody busy about finding out what it\nwas the four men wanted, had conceived the idea of going off without paying what they owed; but the\nlandlord, who minded his own affairs more than other people's, caught them going out of the gate and\ndemanded his reckoning, abusing them for their dishonesty with such language that he drove them to\nreply with their fists, and so they began to lay on him in such a style that the poor man was forced to cry\nout, and call for help. The landlady and her daughter could see no one more free to give aid than Don\nQuixote, and to him the daughter said, \"Sir knight, by the virtue God has given you, help my poor father,\nfor two wicked men are beating him to a mummy.\"\nTo which Don Quixote very deliberately and phlegmatically replied, \"Fair damsel, at the present moment\nyour request is inopportune, for I am debarred from involving myself in any adventure until I have\nbrought to a happy conclusion one to which my word has pledged me; but that which I can do for you is\nwhat I will now mention: run and tell your father to stand his ground as well as he can in this battle, and\non no account to allow himself to be vanquished, while I go and request permission of the Princess\nMicomicona to enable me to succour him in his distress; and if she grants it, rest assured I will relieve him\nfrom it.\"\n-142\n\n\"Sinner that I am,\" exclaimed Maritornes, who stood by; \"before you have got your permission my master\nwill be in the other world.\"\n\"Give me leave, senora, to obtain the permission I speak of,\" returned Don Quixote; \"and if I get it, it will\nmatter very little if he is in the other world; for I will rescue him thence in spite of all the same world can\ndo; or at any rate I will give you such a revenge over those who shall have sent him there that you will be\nmore than moderately satisfied;\" and without saying anything more he went and knelt before Dorothea,\nrequesting her Highness in knightly and errant phrase to be pleased to grant him permission to aid and\nsuccour the castellan of that castle, who now stood in grievous jeopardy. The princess granted it\ngraciously, and he at once, bracing his buckler on his arm and drawing his sword, hastened to the\ninn-gate, where the two guests were still handling the landlord roughly; but as soon as he reached the spot\nhe stopped short and stood still, though Maritornes and the landlady asked him why he hesitated to help\ntheir master and husband.\n\"I hesitate,\" said Don Quixote, \"because it is not lawful for me to draw sword against persons of squirely\ncondition; but call my squire Sancho to me; for this defence and vengeance are his affair and business.\"\nThus matters stood at the inn-gate, where there was a very lively exchange of fisticuffs and punches, to\nthe sore damage of the landlord and to the wrath of Maritornes, the landlady, and her daughter, who were\nfurious when they saw the cowardice of Don Quixote and the hard treatment their master, husband and\nfather was undergoing. However, although debarred from fighting, Don Quixote had established peace\nbetween the departing guests and the landlord, by persuasion and fair words more than by threats, and\nthey paid him what he demanded. All would now have been at peace, but the devil, who never sleeps,\ncontrived that the barber, from whom Don Quixote had taken Mambrino's helmet, and Sancho Panza the\ntrappings of his ass in exchange for those of his own, should at this instant enter the inn; which said\nbarber, as he led his ass to the stable, observed Sancho Panza engaged in repairing something or other\nbelonging to the pack-saddle; and the moment he saw it he knew it, and made bold to attack Sancho,\nexclaiming, \"Ho, sir thief, I have caught you! hand over my basin and my pack-saddle, and all my\ntrappings that you robbed me of.\"\nSancho, finding himself so unexpectedly assailed, and hearing the abuse poured upon him, seized the\npack-saddle with one hand, and with the other gave the barber a cuff that bathed his teeth in blood. The\nbarber, however, was not so ready to relinquish the prize he had made in the pack-saddle; on the contrary,\nhe raised such an outcry that everyone in the inn came running to know what the noise and quarrel meant.\n\"Here, in the name of the king and justice!\" he cried, \"this thief and highwayman wants to kill me for\ntrying to recover my property.\"\n\"You lie,\" said Sancho, \"I am no highwayman; it was in fair war my master Don Quixote won these\nspoils.\"\nDon Quixote was standing by at the time, highly pleased to see his squire's stoutness, both offensive and\ndefensive, and from that time forth he reckoned him a man of mettle, and in his heart resolved to dub him\na knight on the first opportunity that presented itself, feeling sure that the order of chivalry would be\nfittingly bestowed upon him.\nIn the course of the altercation, among other things the barber said, \"Gentlemen, this pack-saddle is mine\nas surely as I owe God a death, and I know it as well as if I had given birth to it, and here is my ass in the\nstable who will not let me lie; only try it, and if it does not fit him like a glove, call me a rascal; and what\nis more, the same day I was robbed of this, they robbed me likewise of a new brass basin, never yet\nhandselled, that would fetch a crown any day.\"\n-143\n\nAt this Don Quixote could not keep himself from answering; and interposing between the two, and\nseparating them, he placed the pack-saddle on the ground, to lie there in sight until the truth was\nestablished, and said, \"Your worships may perceive clearly and plainly the error under which this worthy\nsquire lies when he calls a basin which was, is, and shall be the helmet of Mambrino which I won from\nhim in air war, and made myself master of by legitimate and lawful possession. With the pack-saddle I do\nnot concern myself; but I may tell you on that head that my squire Sancho asked my permission to strip\noff the horse's trappings of this vanquished poltroon's steed, and with it adorn his own; I allowed him,\nand he took it; and as to its having been changed from a horse's trappings into a pack-saddle, I can give\nno explanation except the usual one, that such transformations will take place in adventures of chivalry.\nTo confirm all which, run, Sancho my son, and fetch hither the helmet which this good fellow calls a\nbasin.\"\n\"Egad, master,\" said Sancho, \"if we have no other proof of our case than what your worship puts forward,\nMambrino's helmet is just as much a basin as this good fellow's horse's trappingis a pack-saddle.\"\n\"Do as I bid thee,\" said Don Quixote; \"it cannot be that everything in this castle goes by enchantment.\"\nSancho hastened to where the basin was, and brought it back with him, and when Don Quixote saw it, he\ntook hold of it and said:\n\"Your worships may see with what a face this squire can assert that this is a basin and not the helmet I\ntold you of; and I swear by the order of chivalry I profess, that this helmet is the identical one I took from\nhim, without anything added to or taken from it.\"\n\"There is no doubt of that,\" said Sancho, \"for from the time my master won it until now he has only\nfought one battle in it, when he let loose those unlucky men in chains; and if had not been for this\nbasin-helmet he would not have come off over well that time, for there was plenty of stone-throwing in\nthat affair.\"\nCHAPTER XLV.\nIN WHICH THE DOUBTFUL QUESTION OF MAMBRINO'S HELMET AND THE PACK-SADDLE\nIS FINALLY SETTLED, WITH OTHER ADVENTURES THAT OCCURRED IN TRUTH AND\nEARNEST\n\"What do you think now, gentlemen,\" said the barber, \"of those that say that this is a helmet?\"\n\"Whoever says the contrary,\" said Don Quixote, \"I will let him know he lies if he is a knight, and if he is\na squire that he lies again a thousand times.\"\nOur own barber, who was present at all this, and understood Don Quixote's humour so thoroughly, took it\ninto his head to back up his delusion and carry on the joke for the general amusement; so addressing the\nother barber he said:\n\"Senor barber, or whatever you are, you must know that I belong to your profession too, and have had a\nlicence to practise for more than twenty years, and I know the implements of the barber craft, every one\nof them, perfectly well; and I was likewise a soldier for some time in the days of my youth, and I know\nalso what a helmet is, and a morion, and a headpiece with a visor, and other things pertaining to\nsoldiering, I meant to say to soldiers' arms; and I say-saving better opinions and always with submission\nto sounder judgments--that this piece we have now before us, which this worthy gentleman has in his\nhands, not only is no barber's basin, but is as far from being one as white is from black, and truth from\n-144\n\nfalsehood; I say, moreover, that this, although it is a helmet, is not a complete helmet.\"\n\"Certainly not,\" said Don Quixote, \"for half of it is wanting, that is to say the beaver2.\"\n\"It is quite true,\" said the curate, who saw the object of his friend the barber; and Cardenio, Don Fernando\nand his companions agreed with him. \"God bless me!\" exclaimed their butt the barber at this; \"is it\npossible that such an honourable company can say that this is not a basin but a helmet? Why, this is a\nthing that would astonish a whole university, however wise it might be! That will do; if this basin is a\nhelmet, why, then the pack-saddle must be a horse's trappings, as this gentleman has said.\"\n\"To me it looks like a pack-saddle,\" said Don Quixote; \"but I have already said that with that question I\ndo not concern myself.\"\n\"As to whether it be pack-saddle or a horse's trappings,\" said the curate, \"it is only for Senor Don\nQuixote to say; for in these matters of chivalry all these gentlemen and I bow to his authority.\"\n\"By God, gentlemen,\" said Don Quixote, \"so many strange things have happened to me in this castle on\nthe two occasions on which I have sojourned in it, that I will not venture to assert anything positively in\nreply to any question touching anything it contains; for it is my belief that everything that goes on within\nit goes by enchantment. The first time, an enchanted Moor that there is in it gave me sore trouble, nor did\nSancho fare well among certain followers of his; and last night I was kept hanging by this arm for nearly\ntwo hours, without knowing how or why I came by such a mishap. So that now, for me to come forward\nto give an opinion in such a puzzling matter, would be to risk a rash decision. As regards the assertion\nthat this is a basin and not a helmet I have already given an answer; but as to the question whether this is a\npack-saddle or a horse's trappings I will not venture to give a positive opinion, but will leave it to your\nworships' better judgment. Perhaps as you are not dubbed knights like myself, the enchantments of this\nplace have nothing to do with you, and your faculties are unfettered, and you can see things in this castle\nas they really and truly are, and not as they appear to me.\"\n\"There can be no question,\" said Don Fernando on this, \"but that Senor Don Quixote has spoken very\nwisely, and that with us rests the decision of this matter; and that we may have surer ground to go on, I\nwill take the votes of the gentlemen in secret, and declare the result clearly and fully.\"\nTo those who were in the secret of Don Quixote's humour all this afforded great amusement; but to those\nwho knew nothing about it, it seemed the greatest nonsense in the world, in particular to the four\ntravellers and to three others, who had by chance come to the inn, and had the appearance of officers of\nthe Holy Brotherhood, as indeed they were. But the one who above all was at his wits' end, was the\nbarber whose basin, there before his very eyes, had been turned into Mambrino's helmet, and whose\npack-saddle he had no doubt whatever was about to become trappings for a horse. All laughed to see Don\nFernando going from one to another collecting the votes, and whispering to them to give him their private\nopinion whether the treasure over which there had been so much fighting was a pack-saddle or a horse's\ntrappings; but after he had taken the votes of those who knew Don Quixote, he said aloud, \"The fact is,\nmy good fellow, that I am tired collecting such a number of opinions, for I find that there is not one of\nwhom I ask what I desire to know, who does not tell me that it is absurd to say that this is the pack-saddle\nof an ass, and not the horse's trappings of a horse, nay, of a thoroughbred horse; so you must submit, for,\nin spite of you and your ass, this is a horse's trappings and no pack-saddle, and you have stated and\nproved your case very badly.\"\n2The part of a knight's helmet that extends below the crown to the neck.\n-145\n\n\"May I never share heaven,\" said the poor barber, \"if your worships are not all mistaken; and may my\nsoul appear before God as that appears to me a pack-saddle and not a horse's trappings; but, 'laws go,'-I\nsay no more; and indeed I am not drunk, for I am fasting, except it be from sin.\"\nThe simple talk of the barber did not afford less amusement than the absurdities of Don Quixote, who\nnow observed: \"There is no more to be done now than for each to take what belongs to him, and to whom\nGod has given it, may St. Peter add his blessing.\"\nBut said one of the travellers, \"Unless, indeed, this is a deliberate joke, I cannot bring myself to believe\nthat men so intelligent as those present are, or seem to be, can venture to declare and assert that this is not\na basin, and that not a pack-saddle; but as I perceive that they do assert and declare it, I can only come to\nthe conclusion that there is some mystery in this persistence in what is so opposed to the evidence of\nexperience and truth itself; for I swear by\"--and here he rapped out a round oath-\"all the people in the\nworld will not make me believe that this is not a barber's basin and that a jackass's pack-saddle.\"\n\"It might easily be a she-ass's,\" observed the curate.\n\"It is all the same,\" said the traveller; \"that is not the point; but whether it is or is not a pack-saddle, as\nyour worships say.\"\nOn hearing this one of the newly arrived officers of the Brotherhood, who had been listening to the\ndispute and controversy, unable to restrain his anger and impatience, exclaimed, \"It is a pack-saddle as\nsure as my father is my father, and whoever has said or will say anything else must be drunk.\"\n\"You lie like a rascally clown,\" returned Don Quixote; and lifting his pike, which he had never let out of\nhis hand, he delivered such a blow at his head that, had not the officer dodged it, it would have stretched\nhim at full length. The pike was shivered in pieces against the ground, and the rest of the officers, seeing\ntheir comrade assaulted, raised a shout, calling for help for the Holy Brotherhood. The landlord, who was\nof the fraternity, ran at once to fetch his staff of office and his sword, and ranged himself on the side of\nhis comrades; the barber, seeing the house turned upside down, once more laid hold of his pack-saddle\nand Sancho did the same; Don Quixote drew his sword and charged the officers; Don Luis cried out to his\nservants to leave him alone and go and help Don Quixote, and Cardenio and Don Fernando, who were\nsupporting him; the curate was shouting at the top of his voice, the landlady was screaming, her daughter\nwas wailing, Maritornes was weeping, Dorothea was aghast, and Luscinda was in a faint. The barber\ncudgelled Sancho, and Sancho pommelled the barber; Don Fernando had got one of the officers down and\nwas belabouring him heartily; the landlord raised his voice again calling for help for the Holy\nBrotherhood; so that the whole inn was nothing but cries, shouts, shrieks, confusion, terror, dismay,\nmishaps, sword-cuts, fisticuffs, cudgellings, kicks, and bloodshed; and in the midst of all this chaos,\ncomplication, and general entanglement, Don Quixote took it into his head that he had been plunged into\nthe thick of the discord of Agramante's camp; and, in a voice that shook the inn like thunder, he cried out:\n\"Hold all, let all sheathe their swords, let all be calm and attend to me as they value their lives!\"\nAll paused at his mighty voice, and he went on to say, \"Did I not tell you, sirs, that this castle was\nenchanted, and that a legion or so of devils dwelt in it? In proof whereof I call upon you to behold with\nyour own eyes how the discord of Agramante's camp has come hither, and been transferred into the midst\nof us. See how they fight, there for the sword, here for the horse, on that side for the eagle, on this for the\nhelmet; we are all fighting, and all at cross purposes. Come then, senor curate, make peace among us; for\nby God Almighty it is a sorry business that so many persons of quality as we are should slay one another\nfor such trifling cause.\" The officers, who did not understand Don Quixote's mode of speaking, and\nfound themselves roughly handled by Don Fernando, Cardenio, and their companions, were not to be\n-146\n\nappeased; the barber was, however, for both his beard and his pack-saddle were the worse for the\nstruggle; while Sancho like a good servant obeyed the slightest word of his master. The landlord alone\ninsisted upon it that they must punish the insolence of this madman, who at every turn raised a\ndisturbance in the inn; but at length the uproar was stilled for the present; the pack-saddle remained a\nhorse's trappings till the day of judgment, and the basin a helmet and the inn a castle in Don Quixote's\nimagination.\nAll having been momentarily pacified and made friends by persuasion of the curate, the enemy of\nconcord and hater of peace, feeling himself slighted and made a fool of, and seeing how little he had\ngained after having involved them all in such an elaborate entanglement, resolved to try his hand once\nmore by stirring up fresh quarrels and disturbances.\nIt came about in this wise: the officers were pacified on learning the rank of those with whom they had\nbeen engaged, and withdrew from the contest, considering that whatever the result might be they were\nlikely to get the worst of the battle; but one of them, the one who had been thrashed and kicked by Don\nFernando, recollected that among some warrants he carried for the arrest of certain delinquents, he had\none against Don Quixote, whom the Holy Brotherhood had ordered to be arrested for setting the galley\nslaves free, as Sancho had, with very good reason, apprehended. Suspecting how it was, then, he wished\nto satisfy himself as to whether Don Quixote's features corresponded; and taking a parchment out of his\nbosom he lit upon what he was in search of, and setting himself to read it deliberately, for he was not a\nquick reader, as he made out each word he fixed his eyes on Don Quixote, and went on comparing the\ndescription in the warrant with his face, and discovered that beyond all doubt he was the person described\nin it. As soon as he had satisfied himself, folding up the parchment, he took the warrant in his left hand\nand with his right seized Don Quixote by the collar so tightly that he did not allow him to breathe, and\nshouted aloud, \"Help for the Holy Brotherhood! and that you may see I demand it in earnest, read this\nwarrant which says this highwayman is to be arrested.\"\nThe curate took the warrant and saw that what the officer said was true, and that it agreed with Don\nQuixote's appearance, who, on his part, when he found himself roughly handled by this rascally clown,\nworked up to the highest pitch of wrath, and all his joints cracking with rage, with both hands seized the\nofficer by the throat with all his might, so that had he not been helped by his comrades he would have\nyielded up his life ere Don Quixote released his hold. The landlord, who had perforce to support his\nbrother officers, ran at once to aid them. The landlady, when she saw her husband engaged in a fresh\nquarrel, lifted up her voice afresh, and its note was immediately caught up by Maritornes and her\ndaughter, calling upon heaven and all present for help; and Sancho, seeing what was going on, exclaimed,\n\"By the Lord, it is quite true what my master says about the enchantments of this castle, for it is\nimpossible to live an hour in peace in it!\"\nDon Fernando parted the officer and Don Quixote, and to their mutual contentment made them relax the\ngrip by which they held, the one the coat collar, the other the throat of his adversary; for all this, however,\nthe officers did not cease to demand their prisoner and call on them to help, and deliver him over bound\ninto their power, as was required for the service of the King and of the Holy Brotherhood, on whose\nbehalf they again demanded aid and assistance to effect the capture of this robber and footpad of the\nhighways.\nDon Quixote smiled when he heard these words, and said very calmly, \"Come now, base, ill-born brood;\ncall ye it highway robbery to give freedom to those in bondage, to release the captives, to succour the\nmiserable, to raise up the fallen, to relieve the needy? Infamous beings, who by your vile grovelling\nintellects deserve that heaven should not make known to you the virtue that lies in knight-errantry, or\nshow you the sin and ignorance in which ye lie when ye refuse to respect the shadow, not to say the\npresence, of any knight-errant! Come now; band, not of officers, but of thieves; footpads with the licence\n-147\n\nof the Holy Brotherhood; tell me who was the ignoramus who signed a warrant of arrest against such a\nknight as I am? Who was he that did not know that knights-errant are independent of all jurisdictions, that\ntheir law is their sword, their charter their prowess, and their edicts their will? Who, I say again, was the\nfool that knows not that there are no letters patent of nobility that confer such privileges or exemptions as\na knight-errant acquires the day he is dubbed a knight, and devotes himself to the arduous calling of\nchivalry? What knight-errant ever paid poll-tax, duty, queen's pin-money, king's dues, toll or ferry? What\ntailor ever took payment of him for making his clothes? What castellan that received him in his castle\never made him pay his shot? What king did not seat him at his table? What damsel was not enamoured of\nhim and did not yield herself up wholly to his will and pleasure? And, lastly, what knight-errant has there\nbeen, is there, or will there ever be in the world, not bold enough to give, single-handed, four hundred\ncudgellings to four hundred officers of the Holy Brotherhood if they come in his way?\"\nCHAPTER XLVI.\nOF THE END OF THE NOTABLE ADVENTURE OF THE OFFICERS OF THE HOLY\nBROTHERHOOD; AND OF THE GREAT FEROCITY OF OUR WORTHY KNIGHT, DON\nQUIXOTE\nWhile Don Quixote was talking in this strain, the curate was endeavouring to persuade the officers that he\nwas out of his senses, as they might perceive by his deeds and his words, and that they need not press the\nmatter any further, for even if they arrested him and carried him off, they would have to release him\nby-and-by as a madman; to which the holder of the warrant replied that he had nothing to do with\ninquiring into Don Quixote's madness, but only to execute his superior's orders, and that once taken they\nmight let him go three hundred times if they liked.\n\"For all that,\" said the curate, \"you must not take him away this time, nor will he, it is my opinion, let\nhimself be taken away.\"\nIn short, the curate used such arguments, and Don Quixote did such mad things, that the officers would\nhave been more mad than he was if they had not perceived his want of wits, and so they thought it best to\nallow themselves to be pacified, and even to act as peacemakers between the barber and Sancho Panza,\nwho still continued their altercation with much bitterness. In the end they, as officers of justice, settled the\nquestion by arbitration in such a manner that both sides were, if not perfectly contented, at least to some\nextent satisfied; for they changed the pack-saddles, but not the girths or head-stalls; and as to Mambrino's\nhelmet, the curate, without Don Quixote's knowing it, paid eight reals for the basin, and the barber\nexecuted a full receipt and engagement to make no further demand then or thenceforth for evermore,\namen. The gift and compensation which the curate gave the barber had not escaped the landlord's notice,\nand he demanded Don Quixote's reckoning, together with the amount of the damage to his wine-skins,\nand the loss of his wine, swearing that neither Rocinante nor Sancho's ass should leave the inn until he\nhad been paid to the very last farthing. The curate settled all and Don Fernando paid; and all became so\npeaceful and quiet that the inn no longer reminded one of the discord of Agramante's camp, as Don\nQuixote said, but of the peace and tranquillity of the age of Augustus: for all which it was the universal\nopinion that their thanks were due to the great zeal and eloquence of the curate, and to the unexampled\ngenerosity of Don Fernando.\nFinding himself now clear and quit of all quarrels, his squire's as well as his own, Don Quixote\nconsidered that it would be advisable to continue the journey he had begun, and bring to a close that great\nadventure for which he had been called and chosen; and with this high resolve he went and knelt before\nDorothea, who, however, would not allow him to utter a word until he had risen; so to obey her he rose,\nand said, \"It is a common proverb, fair lady, that 'diligence is the mother of good fortune,' and experience\nhas often shown in important affairs that the earnestness of the negotiator brings the doubtful case to a\n-148\n\nsuccessful termination; but in nothing does this truth show itself more plainly than in war, where\nquickness and activity forestall the devices of the enemy, and win the victory before the foe has time to\ndefend himself. All this I say, exalted and esteemed lady, because it seems to me that for us to remain any\nlonger in this castle now is useless, and may be injurious to us in a way that we shall find out some day;\nfor who knows but that your enemy the giant may have learned by means of secret and diligent spies that\nI am going to destroy him, and if the opportunity be given him he may seize it to fortify himself in some\nimpregnable castle or stronghold, against which all my efforts and the might of my indefatigable arm may\navail but little? Therefore, lady, let us, as I say, forestall his schemes by our activity, and let us depart at\nonce in quest of fair fortune; for your highness is only kept from enjoying it as fully as you could desire\nby my delay in encountering your adversary.\"\nDon Quixote held his peace and said no more, calmly awaiting the reply of the beauteous princess, who,\nwith commanding dignity and in a style adapted to Don Quixote's own, replied to him in these words, \"I\ngive you thanks, sir knight, for the eagerness you, like a good knight to whom it is a natural obligation to\nsuccour the orphan and the needy, display to afford me aid in my sore trouble; and heaven grant that your\nwishes and mine may be realised, so that you may see that there are women in this world capable of\ngratitude; as to my departure, let it be forthwith, for I have no will but yours; dispose of me entirely in\naccordance with your good pleasure; for she who has once entrusted to you the defence of her person, and\nplaced in your hands the recovery of her dominions, must not think of offering opposition to that which\nyour wisdom may ordain.\"\n\"On, then, in God's name,\" said Don Quixote; \"for, when a lady humbles herself to me, I will not lose the\nopportunity of raising her up and placing her on the throne of her ancestors. Let us depart at once, for the\ncommon saying that in delay there is danger, lends spurs to my eagerness to take the road; and as neither\nheaven has created nor hell seen any that can daunt or intimidate me, saddle Rocinante, Sancho, and get\nready thy ass and the queen's palfrey, and let us take leave of the castellan and these gentlemen, and go\nhence this very instant.\"\nSancho, who was standing by all the time, said, shaking his head, \"Ah! master, master, there is more\nmischief in the village than one hears of, begging all good bodies' pardon.\"\n\"What mischief can there be in any village, or in all the cities of the world, you booby, that can hurt my\nreputation?\" said Don Quixote.\n\"If your worship is angry,\" replied Sancho, \"I will hold my tongue and leave unsaid what as a good squire\nI am bound to say, and what a good servant should tell his master.\"\n\"Say what thou wilt,\" returned Don Quixote, \"provided thy words be not meant to work upon my fears;\nfor thou, if thou fearest, art behaving like thyself; but I like myself, in not fearing.\"\n\"It is nothing of the sort, as I am a sinner before God,\" said Sancho, \"but that I take it to be sure and\ncertain that this lady, who calls herself queen of the great kingdom of Micomicon, is no more so than my\nmother; for, if she was what she says, she would not go rubbing noses with one that is here every instant\nand behind every door.\"\nDorothea turned red at Sancho's words, for the truth was that her husband Don Fernando had now and\nthen, when the others were not looking, gathered from her lips some of the reward his love had earned,\nand Sancho seeing this had considered that such freedom was more like a courtesan than a queen of a\ngreat kingdom; she, however, being unable or not caring to answer him, allowed him to proceed, and he\ncontinued, \"This I say, senor, because, if after we have travelled roads and highways, and passed bad\nnights and worse days, one who is now enjoying himself in this inn is to reap the fruit of our labours,\n-149\n\nthere is no need for me to be in a hurry to saddle Rocinante, put the pad on the ass, or get ready the\npalfrey; for it will be better for us to stay quiet, and let every jade mind her spinning, and let us go to\ndinner.\"\nGood God, what was the indignation of Don Quixote when he heard the audacious words of his squire!\nSo great was it, that in a voice inarticulate with rage, with a stammering tongue, and eyes that flashed\nliving fire, he exclaimed, \"Rascally clown, boorish, insolent, and ignorant, ill-spoken, foul-mouthed,\nimpudent backbiter and slanderer! Hast thou dared to utter such words in my presence and in that of these\nillustrious ladies? Hast thou dared to harbour such gross and shameless thoughts in thy muddled\nimagination? Begone from my presence, thou born monster, storehouse of lies, hoard of untruths, garner\nof knaveries, inventor of scandals, publisher of absurdities, enemy of the respect due to royal personages!\nBegone, show thyself no more before me under pain of my wrath;\" and so saying he knitted his brows,\npuffed out his cheeks, gazed around him, and stamped on the ground violently with his right foot,\nshowing in every way the rage that was pent up in his heart; and at his words and furious gestures Sancho\nwas so scared and terrified that he would have been glad if the earth had opened that instant and\nswallowed him, and his only thought was to turn round and make his escape from the angry presence of\nhis master.\nBut the ready-witted Dorothea, who by this time so well understood Don Quixote's humour, said, to\nmollify his wrath, \"Be not irritated at the absurdities your good squire has uttered, Sir Knight of Regretful\nAppearance, for perhaps he did not utter them without cause, and from his good sense and Christian\nconscience it is not likely that he would bear false witness against anyone. We may therefore believe,\nwithout any hesitation, that since, as you say, sir knight, everything in this castle goes and is brought\nabout by means of enchantment, Sancho, I say, may possibly have seen, through this diabolical medium,\nwhat he says he saw so much to the detriment of my modesty.\"\n\"I swear by God Omnipotent,\" exclaimed Don Quixote at this, \"your highness has hit the point; and that\nsome vile illusion must have come before this sinner of a Sancho, that made him see what it would have\nbeen impossible to see by any other means than enchantments; for I know well enough, from the poor\nfellow's goodness and harmlessness, that he is incapable of bearing false witness against anybody.\"\n\"True, no doubt,\" said Don Fernando, \"for which reason, Senor Don Quixote, you ought to forgive him\nand restore him to the bosom of your favour before illusions take away his senses.\"\nDon Quixote said he was ready to pardon him, and the curate went for Sancho, who came in very humbly,\nand falling on his knees begged for the hand of his master, who having presented it to him and allowed\nhim to kiss it, gave him his blessing and said, \"Now, Sancho my son, thou wilt be convinced of the truth\nof what I have many a time told thee, that everything in this castle is done by means of enchantment.\"\n\"So it is, I believe,\" said Sancho, \"except the affair of the blanket, which came to pass in reality by\nordinary means.\"\n\"Believe it not,\" said Don Quixote, \"for had it been so, I would have avenged thee that instant, or even\nnow; but neither then nor now could I, nor have I seen anyone upon whom to avenge thy wrong.\"\nThey were all eager to know what the affair of the blanket was, and the landlord gave them a minute\naccount of Sancho's flights, at which they laughed not a little, and at which Sancho would have been no\nless out of countenance had not his master once more assured him it was all enchantment. For all that his\nsimplicity never reached so high a pitch that he could persuade himself it was not the plain and simple\ntruth, without any deception whatever about it, that he had been blanketed by beings of flesh and blood,\nand not by visionary and imaginary phantoms, as his master believed and protested.\n-150\n\nThe illustrious company had now been two days in the inn; and as it seemed to them time to depart, they\ndevised a plan so that, without giving Dorothea and Don Fernando the trouble of going back with Don\nQuixote to his village under pretence of restoring Queen Micomicona, the curate and the barber might\ncarry him away with them as they proposed, and the curate be able to take his madness in hand at home;\nand in pursuance of their plan they arranged with the owner of an oxcart who happened to be passing that\nway to carry him after this fashion. They constructed a kind of cage with wooden bars, large enough to\nhold Don Quixote comfortably; and then Don Fernando and his companions, and the officers of the\nBrotherhood, together with the landlord, by the directions and advice of the curate, covered their faces\nand disguised themselves, some in one way, some in another, so as to appear to Don Quixote quite\ndifferent from the persons he had seen in the castle. This done, in profound silence they entered the room\nwhere he was asleep, taking his his rest, and advancing to where he was sleeping tranquilly, not dreaming\nof anything of the kind happening, they seized him firmly and bound him fast hand and foot, so that,\nwhen he awoke startled, he was unable to move, and could only marvel and wonder at the strange figures\nhe saw before him; upon which he at once gave way to the idea which his crazed fancy invariably\nconjured up before him, and took it into his head that all these shapes were phantoms of the enchanted\ncastle, and that he himself was unquestionably enchanted as he could neither move nor help himself;\nprecisely what the curate, the concoctor of the scheme, expected would happen. Of all that were there\nSancho was the only one who was at once in his senses and in his own proper character, and he, though\nhe was within very little of sharing his master's infirmity, did not fail to perceive who all these disguised\nfigures were; but he did not dare to open his lips until he saw what came of this assault and capture of his\nmaster; nor did the latter utter a word, waiting to the upshot of his mishap; which was that bringing in the\ncage, they shut him up in it and nailed the bars so firmly that they could not be easily burst open.\nThey then took him on their shoulders, and as they passed out of the room an awful voice--as much so as\nthe barber, not he of the pack-saddle but the other, was able to make it--was heard to say, \"O Knight of\nRegretful Appearance, let not this captivity in which thou art placed afflict thee, for this must needs be,\nfor the more speedy accomplishment of the adventure in which thy great heart has engaged thee; the\nwhich shall be accomplished when the raging Manchegan lion and the white Tobosan dove shall be\nlinked together, having first humbled their haughty necks to the gentle yoke of matrimony. And from this\nmarvellous union shall come forth to the light of the world brave whelps that shall rival the ravening\nclaws of their valiant father; and this shall come to pass ere the pursuer of the flying nymph shall in his\nswift natural course have twice visited the starry signs. And thou, O most noble and obedient squire that\never bore sword at side, beard on face, or nose to smell with, be not dismayed or grieved to see the flower\nof knight-errantry carried away thus before thy very eyes; for soon, if it so please the Framer of the\nuniverse, thou shalt see thyself exalted to such a height that thou shalt not know thyself, and the promises\nwhich thy good master has made thee shall not prove false; and I assure thee, on the authority of the sage\nMentironiana, that thy wages shall be paid thee, as thou shalt see in due season. Follow then the footsteps\nof the valiant enchanted knight, for it is expedient that thou shouldst go to the destination assigned to both\nof you; and as it is not permitted to me to say more, God be with thee; for I return to that place I wot of;\"\nand as he brought the prophecy to a close he raised his voice to a high pitch, and then lowered it to such a\nsoft tone, that even those who knew it was all a joke were almost inclined to take what they heard\nseriously.\nDon Quixote was comforted by the prophecy he heard, for he at once comprehended its meaning\nperfectly, and perceived it was promised to him that he should see himself united in holy and lawful\nmatrimony with his beloved Dulcinea del Toboso, from whose blessed womb should proceed the whelps,\nhis sons, to the eternal glory of La Mancha; and being thoroughly and firmly persuaded of this, he lifted\nup his voice, and with a deep sigh exclaimed, \"Oh thou, whoever thou art, who hast foretold me so much\ngood, I implore of thee that on my part thou entreat that sage enchanter who takes charge of my interests,\nthat he leave me not to perish in this captivity in which they are now carrying me away, ere I see fulfilled\npromises so joyful and incomparable as those which have been now made me; for, let this but come to\n-151\n\npass, and I shall glory in the pains of my prison, find comfort in these chains wherewith they bind me, and\nregard this bed whereon they stretch me, not as a hard battle-field, but as a soft and happy nuptial couch;\nand touching the consolation of Sancho Panza, my squire, I rely upon his goodness and rectitude that he\nwill not desert me in good or evil fortune; for if, by his ill luck or mine, it may not happen to be in my\npower to give him the island I have promised, or any equivalent for it, at least his wages shall not be lost;\nfor in my will, which is already made, I have declared the sum that shall be paid to him, measured, not by\nhis many faithful services, but by the means at my disposal.\"\nSancho bowed his head very respectfully and kissed both his hands, for, being tied together, he could not\nkiss one; and then the apparitions lifted the cage upon their shoulders and fixed it upon the ox-cart.\nCHAPTER XLVII.\nOF THE STRANGE MANNER IN WHICH DON QUIXOTE OF LA MANCHA WAS CARRIED\nAWAY ENCHANTED, TOGETHER WITH OTHER REMARKABLE INCIDENTS\nWhen Don Quixote saw himself caged and hoisted on the cart in this way, he said, \"Many grave histories\nof knights-errant have I read; but never yet have I read, seen, or heard of their carrying off enchanted\nknights-errant in this fashion, or at the slow pace that these lazy, sluggish animals promise; for they\nalways take them away through the air with marvellous swiftness, enveloped in a dark thick cloud, or on a\nchariot of fire, or it may be on some hippogriff or other beast of the kind; but to carry me off like this on\nan ox-cart! By God, it shames me! But perhaps the chivalry and enchantments of our day take a different\ncourse from that of those in days gone by; and it may be, too, that as I am a new knight in the world, and\nthe first to revive the already forgotten calling of knight-errants, they may have newly invented other\nkinds of enchantments and other modes of carrying off the enchanted. What thinkest thou of the matter,\nSancho my son?\"\n\"I don't know what to think,\" answered Sancho, \"not being as well read as your worship in errant\nwritings; but for all that I venture to say and swear that these apparitions that are about us are not quite\ncatholic.\"\n\"Catholic!\" said Don Quixote. \"Father of me! how can they be Catholic when they are all devils that have\ntaken fantastic shapes to come and do this, and bring me to this condition? And if thou wouldst prove it,\ntouch them, and feel them, and thou wilt find they have only bodies of air, and no consistency except in\nappearance.\"\n\"By God, master,\" returned Sancho, \"I have touched them already; and that devil, that goes about there so\nbusily, has firm flesh, and another property very different from what I have heard say devils have, for by\nall accounts they all smell of brimstone and other bad smells; but this one smells of amber half a league\noff.\" Sancho was here speaking of Don Fernando, who, like a gentleman of his rank, was very likely\nperfumed as Sancho said.\n\"Marvel not at that, Sancho my friend,\" said Don Quixote; \"for let me tell thee devils are crafty; and even\nif they do carry odours about with them, they themselves have no smell, because they are spirits; or, if\nthey have any smell, they cannot smell of anything sweet, but of something foul and fetid; and the reason\nis that as they carry hell with them wherever they go, and can get no ease whatever from their torments,\nand as a sweet smell is a thing that gives pleasure and enjoyment, it is impossible that they can smell\nsweet; if, then, this devil thou speakest of seems to thee to smell of amber, either thou art deceiving\nthyself, or he wants to deceive thee by making thee fancy he is not a devil.\"\nSuch was the conversation that passed between master and man; and Don Fernando and Cardenio,\n-152\n\napprehensive of Sancho's making a complete discovery of their scheme, towards which he had already\ngone some way, resolved to hasten their departure, and calling the landlord aside, they directed him to\nsaddle Rocinante and put the pack-saddle on Sancho's ass, which he did with great alacrity. In the\nmeantime the curate had made an arrangement with the officers that they should bear them company as\nfar as his village, he paying them so much a day. Cardenio hung the buckler on one side of the bow of\nRocinante's saddle and the basin on the other, and by signs commanded Sancho to mount his ass and take\nRocinante's bridle, and at each side of the cart he placed two officers with their muskets; but before the\ncart was put in motion, out came the landlady and her daughter and Maritornes to bid Don Quixote\nfarewell, pretending to weep with grief at his misfortune; and to them Don Quixote said:\n\"Weep not, good ladies, for all these mishaps are the lot of those who follow the profession I profess; and\nif these reverses did not befall me I should not esteem myself a famous knight-errant; for such things\nnever happen to knights of little renown and fame, because nobody in the world thinks about them; to\nvaliant knights they do, for these are envied for their virtue and valour by many princes and other knights\nwho compass the destruction of the worthy by base means. Nevertheless, virtue is of herself so mighty,\nthat, in spite of all the magic that Zoroaster its first inventor knew, she will come victorious out of every\ntrial, and shed her light upon the earth as the sun does upon the heavens. Forgive me, fair ladies, if,\nthrough inadvertence, I have in aught offended you; for intentionally and wittingly I have never done so\nto any; and pray to God that he deliver me from this captivity to which some malevolent enchanter has\nconsigned me; and should I find myself released therefrom, the favours that ye have bestowed upon me in\nthis castle shall be held in memory by me, that I may acknowledge, recognise, and requite them as they\ndeserve.\"\nWhile this was passing between the ladies of the castle and Don Quixote, the curate and the barber bade\nfarewell to Don Fernando and his companions, and in particular to Dorothea and Luscinda. They all\nembraced one another, and promised to let each other know how things went with them, and Don\nFernando directed the curate where to write to him, to tell him what became of Don Quixote, assuring him\nthat there was nothing that could give him more pleasure than to hear of it, and that he too, on his part,\nwould send him word of everything he thought he would like to know, about his marriage and Luscinda's\nreturn to her home. The curate promised to comply with his request carefully, and they embraced once\nmore, and renewed their promises. The curate then mounted and his friend the barber did the same, both\nmasked, so as not to be recognised by Don Quixote, and set out following in the rear of the cart. The\norder of march was this: first went the cart with the owner leading it; at each side of it marched the\nofficers of the Brotherhood, as has been said, with their muskets; then followed Sancho Panza on his ass,\nleading Rocinante by the bridle; and behind all came the curate and the barber on their mighty mules,\nwith faces covered, as aforesaid, and a grave and serious air, measuring their pace to suit the slow steps of\nthe oxen. Don Quixote was seated in the cage, with his hands tied and his feet stretched out, leaning\nagainst the bars as silent and as patient as if he were a stone statue and not a man of flesh. Thus slowly\nand silently they made, it might be, two leagues, until they reached a valley which the carter thought a\nconvenient place for resting and feeding his oxen, and he said so to the curate, but the barber was of\nopinion that they ought to push on a little farther, as at the other side of a hill which appeared close by he\nknew there was a valley that had more grass and much better than the one where they proposed to halt;\nand his advice was taken and they continued their journey.\nJust at that moment the curate, looking back, saw coming on behind them six or seven mounted men, well\nfound and equipped, who soon overtook them, for they were travelling, not at the sluggish, deliberate\npace of oxen, but like men who rode canons' mules, and in haste to take their noontide rest as soon as\npossible at the inn which was in sight not a league off. The quick travellers came up with the slow, and\ncourteous salutations were exchanged; and one of the new comers, who was, in fact, a canon of Toledo\nand master of the others who accompanied him, observing the regular order of the procession, the cart, the\nofficers, Sancho, Rocinante, the curate and the barber, and above all Don Quixote caged and confined,\n-153\n\ncould not help asking what was the meaning of carrying the man in that fashion; though, from the badges\nof the officers, he already concluded that he must be some desperate highwayman or other malefactor\nwhose punishment fell within the jurisdiction of the Holy Brotherhood. One of the officers to whom he\nhad put the question, replied, \"Let the gentleman himself tell you the meaning of his going this way,\nsenor, for we do not know.\"\nDon Quixote overheard the conversation and said, \"Haply, gentlemen, you are versed and learned in\nmatters of errant chivalry? Because if you are I will tell you my misfortunes; if not, there is no good in\nmy giving myself the trouble of relating them;\" but here the curate and the barber, seeing that the\ntravellers were engaged in conversation with Don Quixote, came forward, in order to answer in such a\nway as to save their stratagem from being discovered.\nThe canon, replying to Don Quixote, said, \"In truth, brother, I know more about books of chivalry than I\ndo about Villalpando's elements of logic; so if that be all, you may safely tell me what you please.\"\n\"In God's name, then, senor,\" replied Don Quixote; \"if that be so, I would have you know that I am held\nenchanted in this cage by the envy and fraud of wicked enchanters; for virtue is more persecuted by the\nwicked than loved by the good. I am a knight-errant, and not one of those whose names Fame has never\nthought of immortalising in her record, but of those who, in defiance and in spite of envy itself, and all\nthe enchanters that Persia, or Brahmans that India, or Gymnosophists that Ethiopia ever produced, will\nplace their names in the temple of immortality, to serve as examples and patterns for ages to come,\nwhereby knights-errant may see the footsteps in which they must tread if they would attain the summit\nand crowning point of honour in arms.\"\n\"What Senor Don Quixote of La Mancha says,\" observed the curate, \"is the truth; for he goes enchanted\nin this cart, not from any fault or sins of his, but because of the malevolence of those to whom virtue is\nodious and valour hateful. This, senor, is the Knight of Regretful Appearance, if you have ever heard him\nnamed, whose valiant achievements and mighty deeds shall be written on lasting brass and imperishable\nmarble, notwithstanding all the efforts of envy to obscure them and malice to hide them.\"\nWhen the canon heard both the prisoner and the man who was at liberty talk in such a strain he was ready\nto cross himself in his astonishment, and could not make out what had befallen him; and all his attendants\nwere in the same state of amazement.\nAt this point Sancho Panza, who had drawn near to hear the conversation, said, in order to make\neverything plain, \"Well, sirs, you may like or dislike what I am going to say, but the fact of the matter is,\nmy master, Don Quixote, is just as much enchanted as my mother. He is in his full senses, he eats and he\ndrinks, and he has his calls like other men and as he had yesterday, before they caged him. And if that's\nthe case, what do they mean by wanting me to believe that he is enchanted? For I have heard many a one\nsay that enchanted people neither eat, nor sleep, nor talk; and my master, if you don't stop him, will talk\nmore than thirty lawyers.\" Then turning to the curate he exclaimed, \"Ah, senor curate, senor curate! do\nyou think I don't know you? Do you think I don't guess and see the drift of these new enchantments?\nWell then, I can tell you I know you, for all your face is covered, and I can tell you I am up to you,\nhowever you may hide your tricks. After all, where envy reigns virtue cannot live, and where there is\nniggardliness there can be no liberality. Ill betide the devil! if it had not been for your worship my master\nwould be married to the Princess Micomicona this minute, and I should be a count at least; for no less was\nto be expected, as well from the goodness of my master, him of Regretful Appearance, as from the\ngreatness of my services. But I see now how true it is what they say in these parts, that the wheel of\nfortune turns faster than a mill-wheel, and that those who were up yesterday are down to-day. I am sorry\nfor my wife and children, for when they might fairly and reasonably expect to see their father return to\nthem a governor or viceroy of some island or kingdom, they will see him come back a horse-boy. I have\n-154\n\nsaid all this, senor curate, only to urge your paternity to lay to your conscience your ill-treatment of my\nmaster; and have a care that God does not call you to account in another life for making a prisoner of him\nin this way, and charge against you all the succours and good deeds that my lord Don Quixote leaves\nundone while he is shut up.\n\"Trim those lamps there!\" exclaimed the barber at this; \"so you are of the same fraternity as your master,\ntoo, Sancho? By God, I begin to see that you will have to keep him company in the cage, and be\nenchanted like him for having caught some of his humour and chivalry. It was an evil hour when you let\nyourself be got with child by his promises, and that island you long so much for found its way into your\nhead.\"\n\"I am not with child by anyone,\" returned Sancho, \"nor am I a man to let myself be got with child, if it\nwas by the King himself. Though I am poor I am an old Christian, and I owe nothing to nobody, and if I\nlong for an island, other people long for worse. Each of us is the son of his own works; and being a man I\nmay come to be pope, not to say governor of an island, especially as my master may win so many that he\nwill not know whom to give them to. Mind how you talk, master barber; for shaving is not everything,\nand there is some difference between Peter and Peter. I say this because we all know one another, and it\nwill not do to throw false dice with me; and as to the enchantment of my master, God knows the truth;\nleave it as it is; it only makes it worse to stir it.\"\nThe barber did not care to answer Sancho lest by his plain speaking he should disclose what the curate\nand he himself were trying so hard to conceal; and under the same apprehension the curate had asked the\ncanon to ride on a little in advance, so that he might tell him the mystery of this man in the cage, and\nother things that would amuse him. The canon agreed, and going on ahead with his servants, listened with\nattention to the account of the character, life, madness, and ways of Don Quixote, given him by the\ncurate, who described to him briefly the beginning and origin of his madness, and told him the whole\nstory of his adventures up to his being confined in the cage, together with the plan they had of taking him\nhome to try if by any means they could discover a cure for his madness. The canon and his servants were\nsurprised anew when they heard Don Quixote's strange story, and when it was finished he said, \"To tell\nthe truth, senor curate, I for my part consider what they call books of chivalry to be mischievous to the\nState; and though, led by idle and false taste, I have read the beginnings of almost all that have been\nprinted, I never could manage to read any one of them from beginning to end; for it seems to me they are\nall more or less the same thing; and one has nothing more in it than another; this no more than that. And\nin my opinion this sort of writing and composition is of the same species as the fables they call the\nMilesian, nonsensical tales that aim solely at giving amusement and not instruction, exactly the opposite\nof the apologue fables which amuse and instruct at the same time. And though it may be the chief object\nof such books to amuse, I do not know how they can succeed, when they are so full of such monstrous\nnonsense. For the enjoyment the mind feels must come from the beauty and harmony which it perceives\nor contemplates in the things that the eye or the imagination brings before it; and nothing that has any\nugliness or disproportion about it can give any pleasure. What beauty, then, or what proportion of the\nparts to the whole, or of the whole to the parts, can there be in a book or fable where a lad of sixteen cuts\ndown a giant as tall as a tower and makes two halves of him as if he was an almond cake? And when they\nwant to give us a picture of a battle, after having told us that there are a million of combatants on the side\nof the enemy, let the hero of the book be opposed to them, and we have perforce to believe, whether we\nlike it or not, that the said knight wins the victory by the single might of his strong arm. And then, what\nshall we say of the facility with which a born queen or empress will give herself over into the arms of\nsome unknown wandering knight? What mind, that is not wholly barbarous and uncultured, can find\npleasure in reading of how a great tower full of knights sails away across the sea like a ship with a fair\nwind, and will be to-night in Lombardy and to-morrow morning in the land of Prester John of the Indies,\nor some other that Ptolemy never described nor Marco Polo saw? And if, in answer to this, I am told that\nthe authors of books of the kind write them as fiction, and therefore are not bound to regard niceties of\n-155\n\ntruth, I would reply that fiction is all the better the more it looks like truth, and gives the more pleasure\nthe more probability and possibility there is about it. Plots in fiction should be wedded to the\nunderstanding of the reader, and be constructed in such a way that, reconciling impossibilities, smoothing\nover difficulties, keeping the mind on the alert, they may surprise, interest, divert, and entertain, so that\nwonder and delight joined may keep pace one with the other; all which he will fail to effect who shuns\nverisimilitude and truth to nature, wherein lies the perfection of writing. I have never yet seen any book of\nchivalry that puts together a connected plot complete in all its numbers, so that the middle agrees with the\nbeginning, and the end with the beginning and middle; on the contrary, they construct them with such a\nmultitude of members that it seems as though they meant to produce a chimera or monster rather than a\nwell-proportioned figure. And besides all this they are harsh in their style, incredible in their\nachievements, licentious in their amours, uncouth in their courtly speeches, prolix in their battles, silly in\ntheir arguments, absurd in their travels, and, in short, wanting in everything like intelligent art; for which\nreason they deserve to be banished from the Christian commonwealth as a worthless breed.\"\nThe curate listened to him attentively and felt that he was a man of sound understanding, and that there\nwas good reason in what he said; so he told him that, being of the same opinion himself, and bearing a\ngrudge to books of chivalry, he had burned all Don Quixote's, which were many; and gave him an\naccount of the scrutiny he had made of them, and of those he had condemned to the flames and those he\nhad spared, with which the canon was not a little amused, adding that though he had said so much in\ncondemnation of these books, still he found one good thing in them, and that was the opportunity they\nafforded to a gifted intellect for displaying itself; for they presented a wide and spacious field over which\nthe pen might range freely, describing shipwrecks, tempests, combats, battles, portraying a valiant captain\nwith all the qualifications requisite to make one, showing him sagacious in foreseeing the wiles of the\nenemy, eloquent in speech to encourage or restrain his soldiers, ripe in counsel, rapid in resolve, as bold\nin biding his time as in pressing the attack; now picturing some sad tragic incident, now some joyful and\nunexpected event; here a beauteous lady, virtuous, wise, and modest; there a Christian knight, brave and\ngentle; here a lawless, barbarous braggart; there a courteous prince, gallant and gracious; setting forth the\ndevotion and loyalty of vassals, the greatness and generosity of nobles. \"Or again,\" said he, \"the author\nmay show himself to be an astronomer, or a skilled cosmographer, or musician, or one versed in affairs of\nstate, and sometimes he will have a chance of coming forward as a enchanter if he likes. He can set forth\nthe craftiness of Ulysses, the piety of AEneas, the valour of Achilles, the misfortunes of Hector, the\ntreachery of Sinon, the friendship of Euryalus, the generosity of Alexander, the boldness of Caesar, the\nclemency and truth of Trajan, the fidelity of Zopyrus, the wisdom of Cato, and in short all the faculties\nthat serve to make an illustrious man perfect, now uniting them in one individual, again distributing them\namong many; and if this be done with charm of style and ingenious invention, aiming at the truth as much\nas possible, he will assuredly weave a web of bright and varied threads that, when finished, will display\nsuch perfection and beauty that it will attain the worthiest object any writing can seek, which, as I said\nbefore, is to give instruction and pleasure combined; for the unrestricted range of these books enables the\nauthor to show his powers, epic, lyric, tragic, or comic, and all the moods the sweet and winning arts of\npoesy and oratory are capable of; for the epic may be written in prose just as well as in verse.\"\nCHAPTER XLVIII.\nIN WHICH THE CANON PURSUES THE SUBJECT OF THE BOOKS OF CHIVALRY, WITH\nOTHER MATTERS WORTHY OF HIS WIT\n\"It is as you say, senor canon,\" said the curate; \"and for that reason those who have hitherto written books\nof the sort deserve all the more censure for writing without paying any attention to good taste or the rules\nof art, by which they might guide themselves and become as famous in prose as the two princes of Greek\nand Latin poetry are in verse.\"\n-156\n\n\"I myself, at any rate,\" said the canon, \"was once tempted to write a book of chivalry in which all the\npoints I have mentioned were to be observed; and if I must own the truth I have more than a hundred\nsheets written; and to try if it came up to my own opinion of it, I showed them to persons who were fond\nof this kind of reading, to learned and intelligent men as well as to ignorant people who cared for nothing\nbut the pleasure of listening to nonsense, and from all I obtained flattering approval; nevertheless I\nproceeded no farther with it, as well because it seemed to me an occupation inconsistent with my\nprofession, as because I perceived that the fools are more numerous than the wise; and, though it is better\nto be praised by the wise few than applauded by the foolish many, I have no mind to submit myself to the\nstupid judgment of the silly public, to whom the reading of such books falls for the most part.\"\n\"I applaud your decision,\" said the curate. \"And I believe that the mischief caused by tales of chivalry\nwould be avoided if there were appointed some intelligent and judicious person at court to examine all\nsuch works before they are printed and licensed only the best of them. By this means I have no doubt that\nsome would appear with all the perfections you have described, enriching our language with the gracious\nand precious treasure of eloquence, and driving the old books into obscurity before the light of the new .\nThey would furnish harmless entertainment, not merely for the idle but also for the busiest of men; for the\nbow cannot be always bent, nor can weak human nature exist without some lawful relaxation.\"\nThe canon and the curate had proceeded thus far with their conversation, when the barber, coming\nforward, joined them, and said to the curate, \"This is the spot, senor curate, that I said was a good one for\nfresh and plentiful pasture for the oxen, while we take our noontide rest.\"\n\"And so it seems,\" returned the curate, and he told the canon what he proposed to do, on which he too\nmade up his mind to halt with them, attracted by the aspect of the fair valley that lay before their eyes;\nand to enjoy it as well as the conversation of the curate, to whom he had begun to take a fancy, and also to\nlearn more particulars about the doings of Don Quixote, he desired some of his servants to go on to the\ninn, which was not far distant, and fetch from it what eatables there might be for the whole party, as he\nmeant to rest for the afternoon where he was; to which one of his servants replied that the sumpter mule,\nwhich by this time ought to have reached the inn, carried provisions enough to make it unnecessary to get\nanything from the inn except barley.\n\"In that case,\" said the canon, \"take all the beasts there, and bring the sumpter mule back.\"\nWhile this was going on, Sancho, perceiving that he could speak to his master without having the curate\nand the barber, of whom he had his suspicions, present all the time, approached the cage in which Don\nQuixote was placed, and said, \"Senor, to ease my conscience I want to tell you the state of the case as to\nyour enchantment, and that is that these two here, with their faces covered, are the curate of our village\nand the barber; and I suspect they have hit upon this plan of carrying you off in this fashion, out of pure\nenvy because your worship surpasses them in doing famous deeds; and if this be the truth it follows that\nyou are not enchanted, but hoodwinked and made a fool of. And to prove this I want to ask you one thing;\nand if you answer me as I believe you will answer, you will be able to lay your finger on the trick, and\nyou will see that you are not enchanted but gone wrong in your wits.\"\n\"Ask what thou wilt, Sancho my son,\" returned Don Quixote, \"for I will satisfy thee and answer all thou\nrequirest. As to what thou sayest, that these who accompany us yonder are the curate and the barber, our\nneighbours and acquaintances, it is very possible that they may seem to be those same persons; but that\nthey are so in reality and in fact, believe it not on any account; what thou art to believe and think is that, if\nthey look like them, as thou sayest, it must be that those who have enchanted me have taken this shape\nand likeness; for it is easy for enchanters to take any form they please, and they may have taken those of\nour friends in order to make thee think as thou dost, and lead thee into a labyrinth of fancies from which\nthou wilt find no escape though thou hadst the cord of Theseus; and they may also have done it to make\n-157\n\nme uncertain in my mind, and unable to conjecture whence this evil comes to me; for if on the one hand\nthou dost tell me that the barber and curate of our village are here in company with us, and on the other I\nfind myself shut up in a cage, and know in my heart that no power on earth that was not supernatural\nwould have been able to shut me in, what wouldst thou have me say or think, but that my enchantment is\nof a sort that transcends all I have ever read of in all the histories that deal with knights-errant that have\nbeen enchanted? So thou mayest set thy mind at rest as to the idea that they are what thou sayest, for they\nare as much so as I am a Turk. But touching thy desire to ask me something, say on, and I will answer\nthee, though thou shouldst ask questions from this till to-morrow morning.\"\n\"May Our Lady be good to me!\" said Sancho, lifting up his voice; \"and is it possible that your worship is\nso thick of skull and so short of brains that you cannot see that what I say is the simple truth, and that\nmalice has more to do with your imprisonment and misfortune than enchantment? But as it is so, I will\nprove plainly to you that you are not enchanted. Now tell me, so may God deliver you from this affliction,\nand so may you find yourself when you least expect it in the arms of my lady Dulcinea-\"\n\"Leave off conjuring me,\" said Don Quixote, \"and ask what thou wouldst know; I have already told thee I\nwill answer with all possible precision.\"\n\"That is what I want,\" said Sancho; \"and what I would know, and have you tell me, without adding or\nleaving out anything, but telling the whole truth as one expects it to be told, and as it is told, by all who\nprofess arms, as your worship professes them, under the title of knights-errant-\"\n\"I tell thee I will not lie in any particular,\" said Don Quixote; \"finish thy question; for in truth thou\nweariest me with all these asseverations, requirements, and precautions, Sancho.\"\n\"Well, I rely on the goodness and truth of my master,\" said Sancho; \"and so, because it bears upon what\nwe are talking about, I would ask, speaking with all reverence, whether since your worship has been shut\nup and, as you think, enchanted in this cage, you have felt any desire or inclination to go anywhere, as the\nsaying is?\"\n\"I do not understand 'going anywhere,'\" said Don Quixote; \"explain thyself more clearly, Sancho, if thou\nwouldst have me give an answer to the point.\"\n\"Is it possible,\" said Sancho, \"that your worship does not understand 'going anywhere'? Why, the\nschoolboys know that from the time they were babes. Well then, you must know I mean have you had any\ndesire to do what cannot be avoided?\"\n\"Ah! now I understand thee, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote; \"yes, often, and even this minute; get me out of\nthis strait, or all will not go right.\"\nCHAPTER XLIX.\nWHICH TREATS OF THE SHREWD CONVERSATION WHICH SANCHO PANZA HELD WITH\nHIS MASTER DON QUIXOTE\n\"Aha, I have caught you,\" said Sancho; \"this is what in my heart and soul I was longing to know. Come\nnow, senor, can you deny what is commonly said around us, when a person is out of humour, 'I don't\nknow what ails so-and-so, that he neither eats, nor drinks, nor sleeps, nor gives a proper answer to any\nquestion; one would think he was enchanted'? From which it is to be gathered that those who do not eat,\nor drink, or sleep, or do any of the natural acts I am speaking of-that such persons are enchanted; but not\nthose that have the desire your worship has, and drink when drink is given them, and eat when there is\n-158\n\nanything to eat, and answer every question that is asked them.\"\n\"What thou sayest is true, Sancho,\" replied Don Quixote; \"but I have already told thee there are many\nsorts of enchantments, and it may be that in the course of time they have been changed one for another,\nand that now it may be the way with enchanted people to do all that I do, though they did not do so\nbefore; so it is vain to argue or draw inferences against the usage of the time. I know and feel that I am\nenchanted, and that is enough to ease my conscience; for it would weigh heavily on it if I thought that I\nwas not enchanted, and that in a faint-hearted and cowardly way I allowed myself to lie in this cage,\ndefrauding multitudes of the succour I might afford to those in need and distress, who at this very moment\nmay be in sore want of my aid and protection.\"\n\"Still for all that,\" replied Sancho, \"I say that, for your greater and fuller satisfaction, it would be well if\nyour worship were to try to get out of this prison (and I promise to do all in my power to help, and even to\ntake you out of it), and see if you could once more mount your good Rocinante, who seems to be\nenchanted too, he is so melancholy and dejected; and then we might try our chance in looking for\nadventures again; and if we have no luck there will be time enough to go back to the cage; in which, on\nthe faith of a good and loyal squire, I promise to shut myself up along with your worship, if so be you are\nso unfortunate, or I so stupid, as not to be able to carry out my plan.\"\n\"I am content to do as thou sayest, brother Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"and when thou seest an\nopportunity for effecting my release I will obey thee absolutely; but thou wilt see, Sancho, how mistaken\nthou art in thy conception of my misfortune.\"\nThe knight-errant and the ill-errant squire kept up their conversation till they reached the place where the\ncurate, the canon, and the barber, who had already dismounted, were waiting for them. The carter at once\nunyoked the oxen and left them to roam at large about the pleasant green spot, the freshness of which\nseemed to invite, not enchanted people like Don Quixote, but wide-awake, sensible folk like his squire,\nwho begged the curate to allow his master to leave the cage for a little; for if they did not let him out, the\nprison might not be as clean as the propriety of such a gentleman as his master required. The curate\nunderstood him, and said he would very gladly comply with his request, only that he feared his master,\nfinding himself at liberty, would take to his old courses and make off where nobody could ever find him\nagain.\n\"I will answer for his not running away,\" said Sancho.\n\"And I also,\" said the canon, \"especially if he gives me his word as a knight not to leave us without our\nconsent.\"\nDon Quixote, who was listening to all this, said, \"I give it;-moreover one who is enchanted as I am cannot\ndo as he likes with himself; for he who had enchanted him could prevent his moving from one place for\nthree ages, and if he attempted to escape would bring him back flying.\"--And that being so, they might as\nwell release him, particularly as it would be to the advantage of all; for, if they did not let him out, he\nprotested he would be unable to avoid offending their nostrils unless they kept their distance.\nThe canon took his hand, tied together as they both were, and on his word and promise they unbound him,\nand rejoiced beyond measure he was to find himself out of the cage. The first thing he did was to stretch\nhimself all over, and then he went to where Rocinante was standing and giving him a couple of slaps on\nthe haunches said, \"I still trust in God and in his blessed mother, O flower and mirror of steeds, that we\nshall soon see ourselves, both of us, as we wish to be, thou with thy master on thy back, and I mounted\nupon thee, following the calling for which God sent me into the world.\" And so saying, accompanied by\nSancho, he withdrew to a retired spot, from which he came back much relieved and more eager than ever\n-159\n\nto put his squire's scheme into execution.\nThe canon gazed at him, wondering at the extraordinary nature of his madness, and that in all his remarks\nand replies he should show such excellent sense, and only lose his stirrups, as has been already said, when\nthe subject of chivalry was broached. And so, moved by compassion, he said to him, as they all sat on the\ngreen grass awaiting the arrival of the provisions:\n\"Is it possible, gentle sir, that the nauseous and idle reading of books of chivalry can have had such an\neffect on your worship as to upset your reason so that you fancy yourself enchanted, and the like, all as\nfar from the truth as falsehood itself is? How can there be any human understanding that can persuade\nitself there ever was all that infinity of Amadises in the world, or all that multitude of famous knights, all\nthose emperors of Trebizond, all those Felixmartes of Hircania, all those palfreys, and damsels-errant, and\nserpents, and monsters, and giants, and marvellous adventures, and enchantments of every kind, and\nbattles, and prodigious encounters, splendid costumes, love-sick princesses, squires made counts, droll\ndwarfs, love letters, billings and cooings, swashbuckler women, and, in a word, all that nonsense the\nbooks of chivalry contain? For myself, I can only say that when I read them, so long as I do not stop to\nthink that they are all lies and frivolity, they give me a certain amount of pleasure; but when I come to\nconsider what they are, I fling the very best of them at the wall, and would fling it into the fire if there\nwere one at hand, as richly deserving such punishment as cheats and impostors out of the range of\nordinary toleration, and as founders of new sects and modes of life, and teachers that lead the ignorant\npublic to believe and accept as truth all the folly they contain. And such is their audacity, they even dare\nto unsettle the wits of gentlemen of birth and intelligence, as is shown plainly by the way they have\nserved your worship, when they have brought you to such a pass that you have to be shut up in a cage and\ncarried on an ox-cart as one would carry a lion or a tiger from place to place to make money by showing\nit. Come, Senor Don Quixote, have some compassion for yourself, return to the bosom of common sense,\nand make use of the liberal share of it that heaven has been pleased to bestow upon you, employing your\nabundant gifts of mind in some other reading that may serve to benefit your conscience and add to your\nhonour. And if, still led away by your natural bent, you desire to read books of achievements and of\nchivalry, read the Book of Judges in the Holy Scriptures, for there you will find grand reality, and deeds\nas true as they are heroic. Lusitania had a Viriatus, Rome a Caesar, Carthage a Hannibal, Greece an\nAlexander, Castile a Count Fernan Gonzalez, Valencia a Cid, Andalusia a Gonzalo Fernandez,\nEstremadura a Diego Garcia de Paredes, Jerez a Garci Perez de Vargas, Toledo a Garcilaso, Seville a Don\nManuel de Leon, to read of whose valiant deeds will entertain and instruct the loftiest minds and fill them\nwith delight and wonder. Here, Senor Don Quixote, will be reading worthy of your sound understanding;\nfrom which you will rise learned in history, in love with virtue, strengthened in goodness, improved in\nmanners, brave without rashness, prudent without cowardice; and all to the honour of God, your own\nadvantage and the glory of La Mancha, whence, I am informed, your worship derives your birth.\"\nDon Quixote listened with the greatest attention to the canon's words, and when he found he had finished,\nafter regarding him for some time, he replied to him:\n\"It appears to me, gentle sir, that your worship's discourse is intended to persuade me that there never\nwere any knights-errant in the world, and that all the books of chivalry are false, lying, mischievous and\nuseless to the State, and that I have done wrong in reading them, and worse in believing them, and still\nworse in imitating them, when I undertook to follow the arduous calling of knight-errantry which they set\nforth; for you deny that there ever were Amadises of Gaul or of Greece, or any other of the knights of\nwhom the books are full.\"\n\"It is all exactly as you state it,\" said the canon; to which Don Quixote returned, \"You also went on to say\nthat books of this kind had done me much harm, inasmuch as they had upset my senses, and shut me up in\na cage, and that it would be better for me to reform and change my studies, and read other truer books\n-160\n\nwhich would afford more pleasure and instruction.\"\n\"Just so,\" said the canon.\n\"Well then,\" returned Don Quixote, \"to my mind it is you who are the one that is out of his wits and\nenchanted, as you have ventured to utter such blasphemies against a thing so universally acknowledged\nand accepted as true that whoever denies it, as you do, deserves the same punishment which you say you\ninflict on the books that irritate you when you read them. For to try to persuade anybody that Amadis, and\nall the other knights-adventurers with whom the books are filled, never existed, would be like trying to\npersuade him that the sun does not yield light, or ice cold, or earth nourishment. What wit in the world\ncan persuade another that the story of the Princess Floripes and Guy of Burgundy is not true, or that of\nFierabras and the bridge of Mantible, which happened in the time of Charlemagne? For by all that is good\nit is as true as that it is daylight now; and if it be a lie, it must be a lie too that there was a Hector, or\nAchilles, or Trojan war, or Twelve Peers of France, or Arthur of England, who still lives changed into a\nraven, and is unceasingly looked for in his kingdom. One might just as well try to make out that the\nhistory of Guarino Mezquino, or of the quest of the Holy Grail, is false, or that the loves of Tristram and\nthe Queen Yseult are apocryphal, as well as those of Guinevere and Lancelot, when there are persons who\ncan almost remember having seen the Dame Quintanona, who was the best cupbearer in Great Britain.\nAnd so true is this, that I recollect a grandmother of mine on the father's side, whenever she saw any\ndame in a venerable hood, used to say to me, 'Grandson, that one is like Dame Quintanona,' from which I\nconclude that she must have known her, or at least had managed to see some portrait of her. Then who\ncan deny that the story of Pierres and the fair Magalona is true, when even to this day may be seen in the\nking's armoury the pin with which the valiant Pierres guided the wooden horse he rode through the air,\nand it is a trifle bigger than the pole of a cart? And alongside of the pin is Babieca's saddle, and at\nRoncesvalles there is Roland's horn, as large as a large beam; whence we may infer that there were\nTwelve Peers, and a Pierres, and a Cid, and other knights like them, of the sort people commonly call\nadventurers. Or perhaps I shall be told, too, that there was no such knight-errant as the valiant Lusitanian\nJuan de Merlo, who went to Burgundy and in the city of Arras fought with the famous lord of Charny,\nMosen Pierres by name, and afterwards in the city of Basle with Mosen Enrique de Remesten, coming out\nof both encounters covered with fame and honour; or adventures and challenges achieved and delivered,\nalso in Burgundy, by the valiant Spaniards Pedro Barba and Gutierre Quixada (of whose family I come in\nthe direct male line), when they vanquished the sons of the Count of San Polo. I shall be told, too, that\nDon Fernando de Guevara did not go in quest of adventures to Germany, where he engaged in combat\nwith Micer George, a knight of the house of the Duke of Austria. I shall be told that the jousts of Suero de\nQuinones, him of the 'Paso,' and the emprise of Mosen Luis de Falces against the Castilian knight, Don\nGonzalo de Guzman, were mere mockeries; as well as many other achievements of Christian knights of\nthese and foreign realms, which are so authentic and true, that, I repeat, he who denies them must be\ntotally wanting in reason and good sense.\"\nThe canon was amazed to hear the medley of truth and fiction Don Quixote uttered, and to see how well\nacquainted he was with everything relating or belonging to the achievements of his knight-errantry; so he\nsaid in reply:\n\"I cannot deny, Senor Don Quixote, that there is some truth in what you say, especially as regards the\nSpanish knights-errant; and I am willing to grant too that the Twelve Peers of France existed, but I am not\ndisposed to believe that they did all the things that the Archbishop Turpin relates of them. For the truth of\nthe matter is they were knights chosen by the kings of France, and called 'Peers' because they were all\nequal in worth, rank and prowess (at least if they were not they ought to have been), and it was a kind of\nreligious order like those of Santiago and Calatrava in the present day, in which it is assumed that those\nwho take it are valiant knights of distinction and good birth; and just as we say now a Knight of St. John,\nor of Alcantara, they used to say then a Knight of the Twelve Peers, because twelve equals were chosen\n-161\n\nfor that military order. That there was a Cid, as well as a Bernardo del Carpio, there can be no doubt; but\nthat they did the deeds people say they did, I hold to be very doubtful. In that other matter of the pin of\nCount Pierres that you speak of, and say is near Babieca's saddle in the Armoury, I confess my sin; for I\nam either so stupid or so short-sighted, that, though I have seen the saddle, I have never been able to see\nthe pin, in spite of it being as big as your worship says it is.\"\n\"For all that it is there, without any manner of doubt,\" said Don Quixote; \"and more by token they say it\nis inclosed in a sheath of cowhide to keep it from rusting.\"\n\"All that may be,\" replied the canon; \"but, by the orders I have received, I do not remember seeing it.\nHowever, granting it is there, that is no reason why I am bound to believe the stories of all those\nAmadises and of all that multitude of knights they tell us about, nor is it reasonable that a man like your\nworship, so worthy, and with so many good qualities, and endowed with such a good understanding,\nshould allow himself to be persuaded that such wild crazy things as are written in those absurd books of\nchivalry are really true.\"\nCHAPTER L.\nOF THE SHREWD CONTROVERSY WHICH DON QUIXOTE AND THE CANON HELD,\nTOGETHER WITH OTHER INCIDENTS\n\"A good joke, that!\" returned Don Quixote. \"Books that have been printed with the king's licence, and\nwith the approbation of those to whom they have been submitted, and read with universal delight, and\nextolled by great and small, rich and poor, learned and ignorant, gentle and simple, in a word by people of\nevery sort, of whatever rank or condition they may be--that these should be lies! And above all when they\ncarry such an appearance of truth with them; for they tell us the father, mother, country, kindred, age,\nplace, and the achievements, step by step, and day by day, performed by such a knight or knights! Hush,\nsir; utter not such blasphemy; trust me I am advising you now to act as a sensible man should; only read\nthem, and you will see the pleasure you will derive from them. For, come, tell me, can there be anything\nmore delightful than to see, as it were, here now displayed before us a vast lake of bubbling pitch with a\nhost of snakes and serpents and lizards, and ferocious and terrible creatures of all sorts swimming about in\nit, while from the middle of the lake there comes a plaintive voice saying: 'Knight, whosoever thou art\nwho beholdest this dread lake, if thou wouldst win the prize that lies hidden beneath these dusky waves,\nprove the valour of thy stout heart and cast thyself into the midst of its dark burning waters, else thou\nshalt not be worthy to see the mighty wonders contained in the seven castles of the seven Fays that lie\nbeneath this black expanse;' and then the knight, almost ere the awful voice has ceased, without stopping\nto consider, without pausing to reflect upon the danger to which he is exposing himself, without even\nrelieving himself of the weight of his massive armour, commending himself to God and to his lady,\nplunges into the midst of the boiling lake, and when he little looks for it, or knows what his fate is to be,\nhe finds himself among flowery meadows, with which the Elysian fields are not to be compared.\n\"The sky seems more transparent there, and the sun shines with a strange brilliancy, and a delightful\ngrove of green leafy trees presents itself to the eyes and charms the sight with its verdure, while the ear is\nsoothed by the sweet untutored melody of the countless birds of gay plumage that flit to and fro among\nthe interlacing branches. Here he sees a brook whose limpid waters, like liquid crystal, ripple over fine\nsands and white pebbles that look like sifted gold and purest pearls. There he perceives a cunningly\nwrought fountain of many-coloured jasper and polished marble; here another of rustic fashion where the\nlittle mussel-shells and the spiral white and yellow mansions of the snail disposed in studious disorder,\nmingled with fragments of glittering crystal and mock emeralds, make up a work of varied aspect, where\nart, imitating nature, seems to have outdone it.\n-162\n\n\"Suddenly there is presented to his sight a strong castle or gorgeous palace with walls of massy gold,\nturrets of diamond and gates of jacinth; in short, so marvellous is its structure that though the materials of\nwhich it is built are nothing less than diamonds, carbuncles, rubies, pearls, gold, and emeralds, the\nworkmanship is still more rare. And after having seen all this, what can be more charming than to see how\na bevy of damsels comes forth from the gate of the castle in gay and gorgeous attire, such that, were I to\nset myself now to depict it as the histories describe it to us, I should never have done; and then how she\nwho seems to be the first among them all takes the bold knight who plunged into the boiling lake by the\nhand, and without addressing a word to him leads him into the rich palace or castle, and strips him as\nnaked as when his mother bore him, and bathes him in lukewarm water, and anoints him all over with\nsweet-smelling unguents, and clothes him in a shirt of the softest sendal, all scented and perfumed, while\nanother damsel comes and throws over his shoulders a mantle which is said to be worth at the very least a\ncity, and even more? How charming it is, then, when they tell us how, after all this, they lead him to\nanother chamber where he finds the tables set out in such style that he is filled with amazement and\nwonder; to see how they pour out water for his hands distilled from amber and sweet-scented flowers;\nhow they seat him on an ivory chair; to see how the damsels wait on him all in profound silence; how\nthey bring him such a variety of dainties so temptingly prepared that the appetite is at a loss which to\nselect; to hear the music that resounds while he is at table, by whom or whence produced he knows not.\nAnd then when the repast is over and the tables removed, for the knight to recline in the chair, picking his\nteeth perhaps as usual, and a damsel, much lovelier than any of the others, to enter unexpectedly by the\nchamber door, and herself by his side, and begin to tell him what the castle is, and how she is held\nenchanted there, and other things that amaze the knight and astonish the readers who are perusing his\nhistory.\n\"But I will not expatiate any further upon this, as it may be gathered from it that whatever part of\nwhatever history of a knight-errant one reads, it will fill the reader, whoever he be, with delight and\nwonder; and take my advice, sir, and, as I said before, read these books and you will see how they will\nbanish any melancholy you may feel and raise your spirits should they be depressed. For myself I can say\nthat since I have been a knight-errant I have become valiant, polite, generous, well-bred, magnanimous,\ncourteous, dauntless, gentle, patient, and have learned to bear hardships, imprisonments, and\nenchantments; and though it be such a short time since I have seen myself shut up in a cage like a\nmadman, I hope by the might of my arm, if heaven aid me and fortune thwart me not, to see myself king\nof some kingdom where I may be able to show the gratitude and generosity that dwell in my heart; for by\nmy faith, senor, the poor man is incapacitated from showing the virtue of generosity to anyone, though he\nmay possess it in the highest degree; and gratitude that consists of disposition only is a dead thing, just as\nfaith without works is dead. For this reason I should be glad were fortune soon to offer me some\nopportunity of making myself an emperor, so as to show my heart in doing good to my friends,\nparticularly to this poor Sancho Panza, my squire, who is the best fellow in the world; and I would gladly\ngive him a county I have promised him this ever so long, only that I am afraid he has not the capacity to\ngovern his realm.\"\nSancho partly heard these last words of his master, and said to him, \"Strive hard you, Senor Don Quixote,\nto give me that county so often promised by you and so long looked for by me, for I promise you there\nwill be no want of capacity in me to govern it; and even if there is, I have heard say there are men in the\nworld who farm seigniories, paying so much a year, and they themselves taking charge of the\ngovernment, while the lord, with his legs stretched out, enjoys the revenue they pay him, without\ntroubling himself about anything else. That's what I'll do, and not stand haggling over trifles, but wash\nmy hands at once of the whole business, and enjoy my rents like a duke, and let things go their own way.\"\n\"That, brother Sancho,\" said the canon, \"only holds good as far as the enjoyment of the revenue goes; but\nthe lord of the seigniory must attend to the administration of justice, and here capacity and sound\njudgment come in, and above all a firm determination to find out the truth; for if this be wanting in the\n-163\n\nbeginning, the middle and the end will always go wrong; and God as commonly aids the honest intentions\nof the simple as he frustrates the evil designs of the crafty.\"\n\"I don't understand those philosophies,\" returned Sancho Panza; \"all I know is I would I had the county\nas soon as I shall know how to govern it; for I have as much soul as another, and as much body as anyone,\nand I shall be as much king of my realm as any other of his; and being so I should do as I liked, and doing\nas I liked I should please myself, and pleasing myself I should be content, and when one is content he has\nnothing more to desire, and when one has nothing more to desire there is an end of it; so let the county\ncome, and God he with you, and let us see one another, as one blind man said to the other.\"\n\"That is not bad philosophy thou art talking, Sancho,\" said the canon; \"but for all that there is a good deal\nto be said on this matter of counties.\"\nTo which Don Quixote returned, \"I know not what more there is to be said; I only guide myself by the\nexample set me by the great Amadis of Gaul, when he made his squire count of the Insula Firme; and so,\nwithout any scruples of conscience, I can make a count of Sancho Panza, for he is one of the best squires\nthat ever knight-errant had.\"\nThe canon was astonished at the methodical nonsense (if nonsense be capable of method) that Don\nQuixote uttered, at the way in which he had described the adventure of the knight of the lake, at the\nimpression that the deliberate lies of the books he read had made upon him, and lastly he marvelled at the\nsimplicity of Sancho, who desired so eagerly to obtain the county his master had promised him.\nCHAPTER LI.\nWHICH DEALS WITH A BOLD ATTACK BY DON QUIXOTE, HIS RETURN TO HIS CAGE, AND\nBRINGS THIS EVENTFUL HISTORY TO ITS CONCLUSION\nWhile they were discoursing in this fashion, they heard a trumpet sound a note so doleful that it made\nthem all look in the direction whence the sound seemed to come. But the one that was most excited by\nhearing it was Don Quixote, who, rising to his feet and turning his eyes to the quarter where the sound\nhad been heard, suddenly saw coming down the slope of a hill several men clad in white like penitents.\nThe fact was that the clouds had that year withheld their moisture from the earth, and in all the villages of\nthe district they were organising processions, rogations, and penances, imploring God to open the hands\nof his mercy and send the rain; and to this end the people of a village that was hard by were going in\nprocession to a holy hermitage there was on one side of that valley. Don Quixote when he saw the strange\ngarb of the penitents, without reflecting how often he had seen it before, took it into his head that this was\na case of adventure, and that it fell to him alone as a knight-errant to engage in it; and he was all the more\nconfirmed in this notion, by the idea that an image draped in black they had with them was some\nillustrious lady that these villains and discourteous thieves were carrying off by force. As soon as this\noccurred to him he ran with all speed to Rocinante who was grazing at large, and taking the bridle and the\nbuckler from the saddle-bow, he had him bridled in an instant, and calling to Sancho for his sword he\nmounted Rocinante, braced his buckler on his arm, and in a loud voice exclaimed to those who stood by,\n\"Now, noble company, ye shall see how important it is that there should be knights in the world\nprofessing the of knight-errantry; now, I say, ye shall see, by the deliverance of that worthy lady who is\nborne captive there, whether knights-errant deserve to be held in estimation,\" and so saying he brought\nhis legs to bear on Rocinante--for he had no spurs--and at a full canter (for in all this veracious history we\nnever read of Rocinante fairly galloping) set off to encounter the penitents, though the curate, the canon,\nand the barber ran to prevent him. But it was out of their power, nor did he even stop for the shouts of\n-164\n\nSancho calling after him, \"Where are you going, Senor Don Quixote? What devils have possessed you to\nset you on against our Catholic faith? Plague take me! mind, that is a procession of penitents, and the lady\nthey are carrying on that stand there is the blessed image of the immaculate Virgin. Take care what you\nare doing, senor, for this time it may be safely said you don't know what you are about.\" Sancho laboured\nin vain, for his master was so bent on coming to quarters with these sheeted figures and releasing the lady\nin black that he did not hear a word; and even had he heard, he would not have turned back if the king had\nordered him. He came up with the procession and reined in Rocinante, who was already anxious enough\nto slacken speed a little, and in a hoarse, excited voice he exclaimed, \"You who hide your faces, perhaps\nbecause you are not good subjects, pay attention and listen to what I am about to say to you.\" The first to\nhalt were those who were carrying the image, and one of the four ecclesiastics who were chanting the\nLitany, struck by the strange figure of Don Quixote, the leanness of Rocinante, and the other ludicrous\npeculiarities he observed, said in reply to him, \"Brother, if you have anything to say to us say it quickly,\nfor these brethren are whipping themselves, and we cannot stop, nor is it reasonable we should stop to\nhear anything, unless indeed it is short enough to be said in two words.\"\n\"I will say it in one,\" replied Don Quixote, \"and it is this; that at once, this very instant, ye release that\nfair lady whose tears and sad aspect show plainly that ye are carrying her off against her will, and that ye\nhave committed some scandalous outrage against her; and I, who was born into the world to redress all\nsuch like wrongs, will not permit you to advance another step until you have restored to her the liberty\nshe pines for and deserves.\"\nFrom these words all the hearers concluded that he must be a madman, and began to laugh heartily, and\ntheir laughter acted like gunpowder on Don Quixote's fury, for drawing his sword without another word\nhe made a rush at the stand. One of those who supported it, leaving the burden to his comrades, advanced\nto meet him, flourishing a forked stick that he had for propping up the stand when resting, and with this\nhe caught a mighty cut Don Quixote made at him that severed it in two; but with the portion that\nremained in his hand he dealt such a thwack on the shoulder of Don Quixote's sword arm (which the\nbuckler could not protect against the clownish assault) that poor Don Quixote came to the ground in a sad\nplight.\nSancho Panza, who was coming on close behind puffing and blowing, seeing him fall, cried out to his\nassailant not to strike him again, for he was poor enchanted knight, who had never harmed anyone all the\ndays of his life; but what checked the clown was, not Sancho's shouting, but seeing that Don Quixote did\nnot stir hand or foot; and so, fancying he had killed him, he hastily hitched up his tunic under his girdle\nand took to his heels across the country like a deer.\nBy this time all Don Quixote's companions had come up to where he lay; but the processionists seeing\nthem come running, and with them the officers of the Brotherhood with their crossbows, apprehended\nmischief, and clustering round the image, raised their hoods, and grasped their scourges, as the priests did\ntheir tapers, and awaited the attack, resolved to defend themselves and even to take the offensive against\ntheir assailants if they could. Fortune, however, arranged the matter better than they expected, for all\nSancho did was to fling himself on his master's body, raising over him the most doleful and laughable\nlamentation that ever was heard, for he believed he was dead. The curate was known to another curate\nwho walked in the procession, and their recognition of one another set at rest the apprehensions of both\nparties; the first then told the other in two words who Don Quixote was, and he and the whole troop of\npenitents went to see if the poor gentleman was dead, and heard Sancho Panza saying, with tears in his\neyes, \"Oh flower of chivalry, that with one blow of a stick hast ended the course of thy well-spent life!\nOh pride of thy race, honour and glory of all La Mancha, nay, of all the world, that for want of thee will\nbe full of evil-doers, no longer in fear of punishment for their misdeeds! Oh thou, generous above all the\nAlexanders, since for only eight months of service thou hast given me the best island the sea girds or\nsurrounds! Humble with the proud, haughty with the humble, encounterer of dangers, endurer of outrages,\n-165\n\nenamoured without reason, imitator of the good, scourge of the wicked, enemy of the mean, in short,\nknight-errant, which is all that can be said!\"\nAt the cries and moans of Sancho, Don Quixote came to himself, and the first word he said was, \"He who\nlives separated from you, sweetest Dulcinea, has greater miseries to endure than these. Aid me, friend\nSancho, to mount the enchanted cart, for I am not in a condition to press the saddle of Rocinante, as this\nshoulder is all knocked to pieces.\"\n\"That I will do with all my heart, senor,\" said Sancho; \"and let us return to our village with these\ngentlemen, who seek your good, and there we will prepare for making another sally, which may turn out\nmore profitable and creditable to us.\"\n\"Thou art right, Sancho,\" returned Don Quixote; \"It will be wise to let the malign influence of the stars\nwhich now prevails pass off.\"\nThe canon, the curate, and the barber told him he would act very wisely in doing as he said; and so,\nhighly amused at Sancho Panza's simplicities, they placed Don Quixote in the cart as before. The\nprocession once more formed itself in order and proceeded on its road; the officers of the Brotherhood\ndeclined to go any farther, and the curate paid them what was due to them; the canon begged the curate to\nlet him know how Don Quixote did, whether he was cured of his madness or still suffered from it, and\nthen begged leave to continue his journey; in short, they separated and went their ways, leaving to\nthemselves the curate and the barber, Don Quixote, Sancho Panza, and the good Rocinante, who regarded\neverything with as great resignation as his master. The carter yoked his oxen and made Don Quixote\ncomfortable on a truss of hay, and at his usual deliberate pace took the road the curate directed, and at the\nend of six days they reached Don Quixote's village, and entered it about the middle of the day, which it\nso happened was a Sunday, and the people were all in the plaza, through which Don Quixote's cart\npassed. They all flocked to see what was in the cart, and when they recognised their townsman they were\nfilled with amazement, and a boy ran off to bring the news to his housekeeper and his niece that their\nmaster and uncle had come back all lean and yellow and stretched on a truss of hay on an ox-cart. It was\npiteous to hear the cries the two good ladies raised, how they beat their breasts and poured out fresh\nmaledictions on those accursed books of chivalry; all which was renewed when they saw Don Quixote\ncoming in at the gate.\nAt the news of Don Quixote's arrival Sancho Panza's wife came running, for she by this time knew that\nher husband had gone away with him as his squire, and on seeing Sancho, the first thing she asked him\nwas if the ass was well. Sancho replied that he was, better than his master was.\n\"Thanks be to God,\" said she, \"for being so good to me; but now tell me, my friend, what have you made\nby your squirings? What gown have you brought me back? What shoes for your children?\"\n\"I bring nothing of that sort, wife,\" said Sancho; \"though I bring other things of more consequence and\nvalue.\"\n\"I am very glad of that,\" returned his wife; \"show me these things of more value and consequence, my\nfriend; for I want to see them to cheer my heart that has been so sad and heavy all these ages that you\nhave been away.\"\n\"I will show them to you at home, wife,\" said Sancho; \"be content for the present; for if it please God that\nwe should again go on our travels in search of adventures, you will soon see me a count, or governor of\nan island, and that not one of those everyday ones, but the best that is to be had.\"\n-166\n\n\"Heaven grant it, husband,\" said she, \"for indeed we have need of it. But tell me, what's this about\nislands, for I don't understand it?\"\n\"Honey is not for the mouth of the ass,\" returned Sancho; \"all in good time thou shalt see, wife--nay, thou\nwilt be surprised to hear thyself called 'your ladyship' by all thy vassals.\"\n\"What are you talking about, Sancho, with your ladyships, islands, and vassals?\" returned Teresa\nPanza--for so Sancho's wife was called, though they were not relations, for in La Mancha it is customary\nfor wives to take their husbands' surnames.\n\"Don't be in such a hurry to know all this, Teresa,\" said Sancho; \"it is enough that I am telling you the\ntruth, so shut your mouth. But I may tell you this much by the way, that there is nothing in the world\nmore delightful than to be a person of consideration, squire to a knight-errant, and a seeker of adventures.\nTo be sure most of those one finds do not end as pleasantly as one could wish, for out of a hundred,\nninety-nine will turn out cross and contrary. I know it by experience, for out of some I came blanketed,\nand out of others belaboured. Still, for all that, it is a fine thing to be on the look-out for what may\nhappen, crossing mountains, searching woods, climbing rocks, visiting castles, putting up at inns, all free\nof charge, for knghts-errant never pay bills.\"\nWhile this conversation passed between Sancho Panza and his wife, Don Quixote's housekeeper and\nniece took him in and undressed him and laid him in his old bed. He eyed them askance, and could not\nmake out where he was. The curate charged his niece to be very careful to make her uncle comfortable\nand to keep a watch over him lest he should make his escape from them again, telling her what they had\nbeen obliged to do to bring him home. On this the pair once more lifted up their voices and renewed their\nmaledictions upon the books of chivalry, and implored heaven to plunge the authors of such lies and\nnonsense into the midst of the bottomless pit. They were, in short, kept in anxiety and dread lest their\nuncle and master should give them the slip the moment he found himself somewhat better, and as they\nfeared so it fell out.\nBut the author of this history, though he has devoted research and industry to the discovery of the deeds\nachieved by Don Quixote in his third sally, has been unable to obtain any information respecting them, at\nany rate derived from authentic documents; tradition has merely preserved in the memory of La Mancha\nthe fact that Don Quixote, the third time he sallied forth from his home, betook himself to Saragossa,\nwhere he was present at some famous jousts which came off in that city, and that he had adventures there\nworthy of his valour and high intelligence. Of his end and death he could learn no particulars, nor would\nhe have ascertained it or known of it, if good fortune had not produced an old physician for him who had\nin his possession a leaden box, which, according to his account, had been discovered among the\ncrumbling foundations of an ancient hermitage that was being rebuilt; in which box were found certain\nparchment manuscripts in Gothic character, but in Castilian verse, containing many of his achievements,\nand setting forth the beauty of Dulcinea, the form of Rocinante, the fidelity of Sancho Panza, and the\nburial of Don Quixote himself, together with sundry epitaphs and eulogies on his life and character.\nThese will soon be translated and the asks of those that shall read it nothing in return for the vast toil\nwhich it has cost him in examining and searching the Manchegan archives in order to bring it to light,\nsave that they give him the same credit that people of sense give to the books of chivalry that pervade the\nworld and are so popular; for with this he will consider himself amply paid and fully satisfied, and will be\nencouraged to seek out and produce other histories, if not as truthful, at least equal in invention and not\nless entertaining.\n-167\n\nfrom DON QUIXOTE Volume II (1615)\nCHAPTER I.\nOF THE INTERVIEW THE CURATE AND THE BARBER HAD WITH DON QUIXOTE ABOUT HIS\nMALADY\nCide Hamete Benengeli, in the Second Part of this history, and third sally of Don Quixote, says that the\ncurate and the barber remained nearly a month without seeing him, lest they should recall or bring back to\nhis recollection what had taken place. They did not, however, omit to visit his niece and housekeeper, and\ncharge them to be careful to treat him with attention, and give him comforting things to eat, and such as\nwere good for the heart and the brain, whence, it was plain to see, all his misfortune proceeded. The niece\nand housekeeper replied that they did so, and meant to do so with all possible care and assiduity, for they\ncould perceive that their master was now and then beginning to show signs of being in his right mind.\nThis gave great satisfaction to the curate and the barber, for they concluded they had taken the right\ncourse in carrying him off enchanted on the ox-cart, as has been described in the First Part of this great as\nwell as accurate history, in the last chapter thereof. So they resolved to pay him a visit and test the\nimprovement in his condition, although they thought it almost impossible that there could be any; and\nthey agreed not to touch upon any point connected with knight-errantry so as not to run the risk of\nreopening wounds which were still so tender.\nThey came to see him consequently, and found him sitting up in bed in a green baize waistcoat and a red\nToledo cap, and so withered and dried up that he looked as if he had been turned into a mummy. They\nwere very cordially received by him; they asked him after his health, and he talked to them about himself\nvery naturally and in very well-chosen language. In the course of their conversation they fell to discussing\nwhat they call State-craft and systems of government, correcting this abuse and condemning that,\nreforming one practice and abolishing another, each of the three setting up for a new legislator, a modern\nLycurgus, or a brand-new Solon; and so completely did they remodel the State, that they seemed to have\nthrust it into a furnace and taken out something quite different from what they had put in; and on all the\nsubjects they dealt with, Don Quixote spoke with such good sense that the pair of examiners were fully\nconvinced that he was quite recovered and in his full senses.\nThe niece and housekeeper were present at the conversation and could not find words enough to express\ntheir thanks to God at seeing their master so clear in his mind; the curate, however, changing his original\nplan, which was to avoid touching upon matters of chivalry, resolved to test Don Quixote's recovery\nthoroughly, and see whether it were genuine or not; and so, from one subject to another, he came at last to\ntalk of the news that had come from the capital, and, among other things, he said it was considered certain\nthat the Turk was coming down with a powerful fleet, and that no one knew what his purpose was, or\nwhen the great storm would burst; and that all Christendom was in apprehension of this, which almost\nevery year calls us to arms, and that his Majesty had made provision for the security of the coasts of\nNaples and Sicily and the island of Malta.\nTo this Don Quixote replied, \"His Majesty has acted like a prudent warrior in providing for the safety of\nhis realms in time, so that the enemy may not find him unprepared; but if my advice were taken I would\nrecommend him to adopt a measure which at present, no doubt, his Majesty is very far from thinking of.\"\nThe moment the curate heard this he said to himself, \"God keep thee in his hand, poor Don Quixote, for it\nseems to me thou art precipitating thyself from the height of thy madness into the profound abyss of thy\nsimplicity.\"\n-168\n\nBut the barber, who had the same suspicion as the curate, asked Don Quixote what would be his advice as\nto the measures that he said ought to be adopted; for perhaps it might prove to be one that would have to\nbe added to the list of the many impertinent suggestions that people were in the habit of offering to\nprinces.\n\"Mine, master shaver,\" said Don Quixote, \"will not be impertinent, but, on the contrary, pertinent.\"\n\"I don't mean that,\" said the barber, \"but that experience has shown that all or most of the expedients\nwhich are proposed to his Majesty are either impossible, or absurd, or injurious to the King and to the\nkingdom.\"\n\"Mine, however,\" replied Don Quixote, \"is neither impossible nor absurd, but the easiest, the most\nreasonable, the readiest and most expeditious that could suggest itself to any projector's mind.\"\n\"You take a long time to tell it, Senor Don Quixote,\" said the curate.\n\"I don't choose to tell it here, now,\" said Don Quixote, \"and have it reach the ears of the lords of the\ncouncil to-morrow morning, and some other carry off the thanks and rewards of my trouble.\"\n\"For my part,\" said the barber, \"I give my word here and before God that I will not repeat what your\nworship says, to King, Rook or earthly man--an oath I learned from the ballad of the curate, who, in the\nprelude, told the king of the thief who had robbed him of the hundred gold crowns and his pacing mule.\"\n\"I am not versed in stories,\" said Don Quixote; \"but I know the oath is a good one, because I know the\nbarber to be an honest fellow.\"\n\"Even if he were not,\" said the curate, \"I will go bail and answer for him that in this matter he will be as\nsilent as a dummy, under pain of paying any penalty that may be pronounced.\"\n\"And who will be security for you, senor curate?\" said Don Quixote.\n\"My profession,\" replied the curate, \"which is to keep secrets.\"\n\"Ods body!\" said Don Quixote at this, \"what more has his Majesty to do but to command, by public\nproclamation, all the knights-errant that are scattered over Spain to assemble on a fixed day in the capital,\nfor even if no more than half a dozen come, there may be one among them who alone will suffice to\ndestroy the entire might of the Turk. Give me your attention and follow me. Is it, pray, any new thing for\na single knight-errant to demolish an army of two hundred thousand men, as if they all had but one throat\nor were made of sugar paste? Nay, tell me, how many histories are there filled with these marvels? If only\n(in an evil hour for me: I don't speak for anyone else) the famous Don Belianis were alive now, or any\none of the innumerable progeny of Amadis of Gaul! If any these were alive today, and were to come face\nto face with the Turk, by my faith, I would not give much for the Turk's chance. But God will have\nregard for his people, and will provide some one, who, if not so valiant as the knights-errant of yore, at\nleast will not be inferior to them in spirit; but God knows what I mean, and I say no more.\"\n\"Alas!\" exclaimed the niece at this, \"may I die if my master does not want to turn knight-errant again;\" to\nwhich Don Quixote replied, \"A knight-errant I shall die, and let the Turk come down or go up when he\nlikes, and in as strong force as he can, once more I say, God knows what I mean.\" But here the barber\nsaid, \"I ask your worships to give me leave to tell a short story of something that happened in Seville,\nwhich comes so pat to the purpose just now that I should like greatly to tell it.\" Don Quixote gave him\nleave, and the rest prepared to listen, and he began thus:\n-169\n\n\"In the madhouse at Seville there was a man whom his relations had placed there as being out of his\nmind. He was a graduate of Osuna in canon law; but even if he had been of Salamanca, it was the opinion\nof most people that he would have been mad all the same. This graduate, after some years of confinement,\ntook it into his head that he was sane and in his full senses, and under this impression wrote to the\nArchbishop, entreating him earnestly, and in very correct language, to have him released from the misery\nin which he was living; for by God's mercy he had now recovered his lost reason, though his relations, in\norder to enjoy his property, kept him there, and, in spite of the truth, would make him out to be mad until\nhis dying day. The Archbishop, moved by repeated sensible, well-written letters, directed one of his\nchaplains to make inquiry of the madhouse as to the truth of the curate's statements, and to have an\ninterview with the madman himself, and, if it should appear that he was in his senses, to take him out and\nrestore him to liberty. The chaplain did so, and the governor assured him that the man was still mad, and\nthat though he often spoke like a highly intelligent person, he would in the end break out into nonsense\nthat in quantity and quality counterbalanced all the sensible things he had said before, as might be easily\ntested by talking to him. The chaplain resolved to try the experiment, and obtaining access to the madman\nconversed with him for an hour or more, during the whole of which time he never uttered a word that was\nincoherent or absurd, but, on the contrary, spoke so rationally that the chaplain was compelled to believe\nhim to be sane. Among other things, he said the governor was against him, not to lose the presents his\nrelations made him for reporting him still mad but with lucid intervals; and that the worst foe he had in his\nmisfortune was his large property; for in order to enjoy it his enemies disparaged and threw doubts upon\nthe mercy our Lord had shown him in turning him from a brute beast into a man. In short, he spoke in\nsuch a way that he cast suspicion on the governor, and made his relations appear covetous and heartless,\nand himself so rational that the chaplain determined to take him away with him that the Archbishop might\nsee him, and ascertain for himself the truth of the matter. Yielding to this conviction, the worthy chaplain\nbegged the governor to have the clothes in which the curate had entered the house given to him. The\ngovernor again bade him beware of what he was doing, as the curate was beyond a doubt still mad; but all\nhis cautions and warnings were unavailing to dissuade the chaplain from taking him away. The governor,\nseeing that it was the order of the Archbishop, obeyed, and they dressed the curate in his own clothes,\nwhich were new and decent. He, as soon as he saw himself clothed like one in his senses, and divested of\nthe appearance of a madman, entreated the chaplain to permit him in charity to go and take leave of his\ncomrades the madmen. The chaplain said he would go with him to see what madmen there were in the\nhouse; so they went upstairs, and with them some of those who were present. Approaching a cage in\nwhich there was a furious madman, though just at that moment calm and quiet, the curate said to him,\n'Brother, think if you have any commands for me, for I am going home, as God has been pleased, in his\ninfinite goodness and mercy, without any merit of mine, to restore me my reason. I am now cured and in\nmy senses, for with God's power nothing is impossible. Have strong hope and trust in him, for as he has\nrestored me to my original condition, so likewise he will restore you if you trust in him. I will take care to\nsend you some good things to eat; and be sure you eat them; for I would have you know I am convinced,\nas one who has gone through it, that all this madness of ours comes of having the stomach empty and the\nbrains full of wind. Take courage! take courage! for despondency in misfortune breaks down health and\nbrings on death.'\n\"To all these words of the curate another madman in a cage opposite that of the furious one was listening;\nand raising himself up from an old mat on which he lay stark naked, he asked in a loud voice who it was\nthat was going away cured and in his senses. The curate answered, 'It is I, brother, who am going; I have\nnow no need to remain here any longer, for which I return infinite thanks to Heaven that has had so great\nmercy upon me.'\n\"'Mind what you are saying, curate; don't let the devil deceive you,' replied the madman. 'Keep quiet,\nstay where you are, and you will save yourself the trouble of coming back.'\n\"'I know I am cured,' returned the curate, 'and that I shall not have to go stations again.'\n-170\n\n\"'You cured!' said the madman; 'well, we shall see; God be with you; but I swear to you by Jupiter,\nwhose majesty I represent on earth, that for this crime alone, which Seville is committing to-day in\nreleasing you from this house, and treating you as if you were in your senses, I shall have to inflict such a\npunishment on it as will be remembered for ages and ages, amen. Dost thou not know, thou miserable\nlittle curate, that I can do it, being, as I say, Jupiter the Thunderer, who hold in my hands the fiery bolts\nwith which I am able and am wont to threaten and lay waste the world? But in one way only will I punish\nthis ignorant town, and that is by not raining upon it, nor on any part of its district or territory, for three\nwhole years, to be reckoned from the day and moment when this threat is pronounced. Thou free, thou\ncured, thou in thy senses! and I mad, I disordered, I bound! I will as soon think of sending rain as of\nhanging myself.\n\"Those present stood listening to the words and exclamations of the madman; but our curate, turning to\nthe chaplain and seizing him by the hands, said to him, 'Be not uneasy, senor; attach no importance to\nwhat this madman has said; for if he is Jupiter and will not send rain, I, who am Neptune, the father and\ngod of the waters, will rain as often as it pleases me and may be needful.'\n\"The governor and the bystanders laughed, and at their laughter the chaplain was half ashamed, and he\nreplied, 'For all that, Senor Neptune, it will not do to vex Senor Jupiter; remain where you are, and some\nother day, when there is a better opportunity and more time, we will come back for you.' So they stripped\nthe curate, and he was left where he was; and that's the end of the story.\"\n\"So that's the story, master barber,\" said Don Quixote, \"which came in so pat to the purpose that you\ncould not help telling it? Master shaver, master shaver! how blind is he who cannot see through a sieve. Is\nit possible that you do not know that comparisons of wit with wit, valour with valour, beauty with beauty,\nbirth with birth, are always odious and unwelcome? I, master barber, am not Neptune, the god of the\nwaters, nor do I try to make anyone take me for an astute man, for I am not one. My only endeavour is to\nconvince the world of the mistake it makes in not reviving in itself the happy time when the order of\nknight-errantry was in the field. But our depraved age does not deserve to enjoy such a blessing as those\nages enjoyed when knights-errant took upon their shoulders the defence of kingdoms, the protection of\ndamsels, the succour of orphans and minors, the chastisement of the proud, and the recompense of the\nhumble. With the knights of these days, for the most part, it is the damask, brocade, and rich stuffs they\nwear, that rustle as they go, not the chain mail of their armour; no knight now-a-days sleeps in the open\nfield exposed to the inclemency of heaven, and in full panoply from head to foot; no one now takes a nap,\nas they call it, without drawing his feet out of the stirrups, and leaning upon his lance, as the\nknights-errant used to do; no one now, issuing from the wood, penetrates yonder mountains, and then\ntreads the barren, lonely shore of the sea--mostly a tempestuous and stormy one--and finding on the beach\na little bark without oars, sail, mast, or tackling of any kind, in the intrepidity of his heart flings himself\ninto it and commits himself to the wrathful billows of the deep sea, that one moment lift him up to heaven\nand the next plunge him into the depths; and opposing his breast to the irresistible gale, finds himself,\nwhen he least expects it, three thousand leagues and more away from the place where he embarked; and\nleaping ashore in a remote and unknown land has adventures that deserve to be written, not on parchment,\nbut on brass. But now sloth triumphs over energy, indolence over exertion, vice over virtue, arrogance\nover courage, and theory over practice in arms, which flourished and shone only in the golden ages and in\nknights-errant. For tell me, who was more virtuous and more valiant than the famous Amadis of Gaul?\nWho more discreet than Palmerin of England? Who more gracious and easy than Tirante el Blanco? Who\nmore courtly than Lisuarte of Greece? Who more slashed or slashing than Don Belianis? Who more\nintrepid than Perion of Gaul? Who more ready to face danger than Felixmarte of Hircania? Who more\nsincere than Esplandian? Who more impetuous than Don Cirongilio of Thrace? Who more bold than\nRodamonte? Who more prudent than King Sobrino? Who more daring than Reinaldos? Who more\ninvincible than Roland? and who more gallant and courteous than Ruggiero, from whom the dukes of\nFerrara of the present day are descended, according to Turpin in his 'Cosmography.' All these knights,\n-171\n\nand many more that I could name, senor curate, were knights-errant, the light and glory of chivalry.\nThese, or such as these, I would have to carry out my plan, and in that case his Majesty would find\nhimself well served and would save great expense, and the Turk would be left tearing his beard. And so I\nwill stay where I am, as the chaplain does not take me away; and if Jupiter, as the barber has told us, will\nnot send rain, here am I, and I will rain when I please. I say this that Master Basin may know that I\nunderstand him.\"\n\"Indeed, Senor Don Quixote,\" said the barber, \"I did not mean it in that way, and, so help me God, my\nintention was good, and your worship ought not to be vexed.\"\n\"As to whether I ought to be vexed or not,\" returned Don Quixote, \"I myself am the best judge.\"\nHereupon the curate observed, \"I have hardly said a word as yet; and I would gladly be relieved of a\ndoubt, arising from what Don Quixote has said, that worries and works my conscience.\"\n\"The senor curate has leave for more than that,\" returned Don Quixote, \"so he may declare his doubt, for\nit is not pleasant to have a doubt on one's conscience.\"\n\"Well then, with that permission,\" said the curate, \"I say my doubt is that, all I can do, I cannot persuade\nmyself that the whole pack of knights-errant you, Senor Don Quixote, have mentioned, were really and\ntruly persons of flesh and blood, that ever lived in the world; on the contrary, I suspect it to be all fiction,\nfable, and falsehood, and dreams told by men awakened from sleep, or rather still half asleep.\"\n\"That is another mistake,\" replied Don Quixote, \"into which many have fallen who do not believe that\nthere ever were such knights in the world, and I have often, with divers people and on divers occasions,\ntried to expose this almost universal error to the light of truth. Sometimes I have not been successful in\nmy purpose, sometimes I have, supporting it upon the shoulders of the truth; which truth is so clear that I\ncan almost say I have with my own eyes seen Amadis of Gaul, who was a man of lofty stature, fair\ncomplexion, with a handsome though black beard, of a countenance between gentle and stern in\nexpression, sparing of words, slow to anger, and quick to put it away from him; and as I have depicted\nAmadis, so I could, I think, portray and describe all the knights-errant that are in all the histories in the\nworld; for by the perception I have that they were what their histories describe, and by the deeds they did\nand the dispositions they displayed, it is possible, with the aid of sound philosophy, to deduce their\nfeatures, complexion, and stature.\"\n\"How big, in your worship's opinion, may the giant Morgante have been, Senor Don Quixote?\" asked the\nbarber.\n\"With regard to giants,\" replied Don Quixote, \"opinions differ as to whether there ever were any or not in\nthe world; but the Holy Scripture, which cannot err by a jot from the truth, shows us that there were, when\nit gives us the history of that big Philistine, Goliath, who was seven cubits and a half in height, which is a\nhuge size. Likewise, in the island of Sicily, there have been found leg-bones and arm-bones so large that\ntheir size makes it plain that their owners were giants, and as tall as great towers; geometry puts this fact\nbeyond a doubt. But, for all that, I cannot speak with certainty as to the size of Morgante, though I suspect\nhe cannot have been very tall; and I am inclined to be of this opinion because I find in the history in\nwhich his deeds are particularly mentioned, that he frequently slept under a roof and as he found houses\nto contain him, it is clear that his bulk could not have been anything excessive.\"\n\"That is true,\" said the curate, and yielding to the enjoyment of hearing such nonsense, he asked him what\nwas his notion of the features of Reinaldos of Montalban, and Don Roland and the rest of the Twelve\nPeers of France, for they were all knights-errant.\n-172\n\n\"As for Reinaldos,\" replied Don Quixote, \"I venture to say that he was broad-faced, of ruddy complexion,\nwith roguish and somewhat prominent eyes, excessively punctilious and touchy, and given to the society\nof thieves and scapegraces. With regard to Roland, or Rotolando, or Orlando (for the histories call him by\nall these names), I am of opinion, and hold, that he was of middle height, broad-shouldered, rather\nbow-legged, swarthy-complexioned, red-bearded, with a hairy body and a severe expression of\ncountenance, a man of few words, but very polite and well-bred.\"\n\"If Roland was not a more graceful person than your worship has described,\" said the curate, \"it is no\nwonder that the fair Lady Angelica rejected him and left him for the gaiety, liveliness, and grace of that\nbudding-bearded little Moor to whom she surrendered herself; and she showed her sense in falling in love\nwith the gentle softness of Medoro rather than the roughness of Roland.\"\n\"That Angelica, senor curate,\" returned Don Quixote, \"was a giddy damsel, flighty and somewhat\nwanton, and she left the world as full of her vagaries as of the fame of her beauty. She treated with scorn a\nthousand gentlemen, men of valour and wisdom, and took up with a smooth-faced sprig of a page,\nwithout fortune or fame, except such reputation for gratitude as the affection he bore his friend got for\nhim. The great poet who sang her beauty, the famous Ariosto, not caring to sing her adventures after her\ncontemptible surrender (which probably were not over and above creditable), dropped her where he says:\nHow she received the sceptre of Cathay, Some bard of defter quill may sing some day;\nand this was no doubt a kind of prophecy, for poets are also called vates, that is to say diviners; and its\ntruth was made plain; for since then a famous Andalusian poet has lamented and sung her tears, and\nanother famous and rare poet, a Castilian, has sung her beauty.\"\n\"Tell me, Senor Don Quixote,\" said the barber here, \"among all those who praised her, has there been no\npoet to write a satire on this Lady Angelica?\"\n\"I can well believe,\" replied Don Quixote, \"that if Sacripante or Roland had been poets they would have\ngiven the damsel a trimming; for it is naturally the way with poets who have been scorned and rejected by\ntheir ladies, whether fictitious or not, in short by those whom they select as the ladies of their thoughts, to\navenge themselves in satires and libels--a vengeance, to be sure, unworthy of generous hearts; but up to\nthe present I have not heard of any defamatory verse against the Lady Angelica, who turned the world\nupside down.\"\n\"Strange,\" said the curate; but at this moment they heard the housekeeper and the niece, who had\npreviously withdrawn from the conversation, exclaiming aloud in the courtyard, and at the noise they all\nran out.\nCHAPTER II.\nWHICH TREATS OF THE NOTABLE ALTERCATION WHICH SANCHO PANZA HAD WITH DON\nQUIXOTE'S NIECE, AND HOUSEKEEPER, TOGETHER WITH OTHER DROLL MATTERS\nThe history relates that the outcry Don Quixote, the curate, and the barber heard came from the niece and\nthe housekeeper exclaiming to Sancho, who was striving to force his way in to see Don Quixote while\nthey held the door against him, \"What does the vagabond want in this house? Be off to your own, brother,\nfor it is you, and no one else, that delude my master, and lead him astray, and take him tramping about the\ncountry.\"\nTo which Sancho replied, \"Devil's own housekeeper! it is I who am deluded, and led astray, and taken\n-173\n\ntramping about the country, and not thy master! He has carried me all over the world, and you are\nmightily mistaken. He enticed me away from home by a trick, promising me an island, which I am still\nwaiting for.\"\n\"May evil islands choke thee, thou detestable Sancho,\" said the niece; \"What are islands? Is it something\nto eat, glutton and gormandiser that thou art?\"\n\"It is not something to eat,\" replied Sancho, \"but something to govern and rule, and better than four cities\nor four judgeships at court.\"\n\"For all that,\" said the housekeeper, \"you don't enter here, you bag of mischief and sack of knavery; go\ngovern your house and dig your seed-patch, and give over looking for islands or shylands.\"\nThe curate and the barber listened with great amusement to the words of the three; but Don Quixote,\nuneasy lest Sancho should blab and blurt out a whole heap of mischievous stupidities, and touch upon\npoints that might not be altogether to his credit, called to him and made the other two hold their tongues\nand let him come in. Sancho entered, and the curate and the barber took their leave of Don Quixote, of\nwhose recovery they despaired when they saw how wedded he was to his crazy ideas, and how saturated\nwith the nonsense of his unlucky chivalry; and said the curate to the barber, \"You will see, my friend, that\nwhen we are least thinking of it, our gentleman will be off once more for another flight.\"\n\"I have no doubt of it,\" returned the barber; \"but I do not wonder so much at the madness of the knight as\nat the simplicity of the squire, who has such a firm belief in all that about the island, that I suppose all the\nexposures that could be imagined would not get it out of his head.\"\n\"God help them,\" said the curate; \"and let us be on the look-out to see what comes of all these absurdities\nof the knight and squire, for it seems as if they had both been cast in the same mould, and the madness of\nthe master without the simplicity of the man would not be worth a farthing.\"\n\"That is true,\" said the barber, \"and I should like very much to know what the pair are talking about at\nthis moment.\"\n\"I promise you,\" said the curate, \"the niece or the housekeeper will tell us by-and-by, for they are not the\nones to forget to listen.\"\nMeanwhile Don Quixote shut himself up in his room with Sancho, and when they were alone he said to\nhim, \"It grieves me greatly, Sancho, that thou shouldst have said, and sayest, that I took thee out of thy\ncottage, when thou knowest I did not remain in my house. We sallied forth together, we took the road\ntogether, we wandered abroad together; we have had the same fortune and the same luck; if they\nblanketed thee once, they belaboured me a hundred times, and that is the only advantage I have of thee.\"\n\"That was only reasonable,\" replied Sancho, \"for, by what your worship says, misfortunes belong more\nproperly to knights-errant than to their squires.\"\n\"Thou art mistaken, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"according to the maxim quando caput dolet, etc.\"\n\"I don't understand any language but my own,\" said Sancho.\n\"I mean to say,\" said Don Quixote, \"that when the head suffers all the members suffer; and so, being thy\nlord and master, I am thy head, and thou a part of me as thou art my servant; and therefore any evil that\naffects or shall affect me should give thee pain, and what affects thee give pain to me.\"\n-174\n\n\"It should be so,\" said Sancho; \"but when I was blanketed as a member, my head was on the other side of\nthe wall, looking on while I was flying through the air, and did not feel any pain whatever; and if the\nmembers are obliged to feel the suffering of the head, it should be obliged to feel their sufferings.\"\n\"Dost thou mean to say now, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"that I did not feel when they were blanketing\nthee? If thou dost, thou must not say so or think so, for I felt more pain then in spirit than thou didst in\nbody. But let us put that aside for the present, for we shall have opportunities enough for considering and\nsettling the point; tell me, Sancho my friend, what do they say about me in the village here? What do the\ncommon people think of me? What do the gentry? What do the knights? What do they say of my valour;\nof my achievements; of my courtesy? How do they treat the task I have undertaken in reviving and\nrestoring to the world the now forgotten order of chivalry? In short, Sancho, I would have thee tell me all\nthat has come to thine ears on this subject; and thou art to tell me, without adding anything to the good or\ntaking away anything from the bad; for it is the duty of loyal vassals to tell the truth to their lords just as it\nis and in its proper shape, not allowing flattery to add to it or any idle deference to lessen it. And I would\nhave thee know, Sancho, that if the naked truth, undisguised by flattery, came to the ears of princes, times\nwould be different, and other ages would be reckoned iron ages more than ours, which I hold to be the\ngolden of these latter days. Profit by this advice, Sancho, and report to me clearly and faithfully the truth\nof what thou knowest touching what I have demanded of thee.\"\n\"That I will do with all my heart, master,\" replied Sancho, \"provided your worship will not be vexed at\nwhat I say, as you wish me to say it out in all its nakedness, without putting any more clothes on it than it\ncame to my knowledge in.\"\n\"I will not be vexed at all,\" returned Don Quixote; \"thou mayest speak freely, Sancho, and without any\nbeating about the bush.\"\n\"Well then,\" said he, \"first of all, I have to tell you that the common people consider your worship a\nmighty great madman, and me no less a fool. The gentry say that, not keeping within the bounds of your\nquality of gentleman, you have turned yourself into a Don, and made a knight of yourself at a jump, with\nfour vine-stocks and a couple of acres of land, and never a shirt to your back. The knights say they do not\nwant to have gentry setting up in opposition to them, particularly squirelings who polish their own shoes\nand darn their black stockings with green silk.\"\n\"That,\" said Don Quixote, \"does not apply to me, for I always go well dressed and never patched; ragged\nI may be, but ragged more from the wear and tear of arms than of time.\"\n\"As to your worship's valour, courtesy, accomplishments, and task, there is a variety of opinions. Some\nsay, 'mad but droll;' others, 'valiant but unlucky;' others, 'courteous but meddling,' and then they go into\nsuch a number of things that they don't leave a whole bone either in your worship or in myself.\"\n\"Recollect, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"that wherever virtue exists in an eminent degree it is persecuted.\nFew or none of the famous men that have lived escaped being calumniated by malice. Julius Caesar, the\nboldest, wisest, and bravest of captains, was charged with being ambitious, and not particularly cleanly in\nhis dress, or pure in his morals. Of Alexander, whose deeds won him the name of Great, they say that he\nwas somewhat of a drunkard. Of Hercules, him of the many labours, it is said that he was lewd and\nluxurious. Of Don Galaor, the brother of Amadis of Gaul, it was whispered that he was over quarrelsome,\nand of his brother that he was lachrymose. So that, O Sancho, amongst all these calumnies against good\nmen, mine may be let pass, since they are no more than thou hast said.\"\n\"That's just where it is, body of my father!\"\n-175\n\n\"Is there more, then?\" asked Don Quixote.\n\"There's the tail to be skinned yet,\" said Sancho; \"all so far is cakes and fancy bread; but if your worship\nwants to know all about the calumnies they bring against you, I will fetch you one this instant who can\ntell you the whole of them without missing an atom; for last night the son of Bartholomew Carrasco, who\nhas been studying at Salamanca, came home after having been made a bachelor, and when I went to\nwelcome him, he told me that your worship's history is already abroad in books, with the title of THE\nINGENIOUS GENTLEMAN DON QUIXOTE OF LA MANCHA; and he says they mention me in it by\nmy own name of Sancho Panza, and the lady Dulcinea del Toboso too, and divers things that happened to\nus when we were alone; so that I crossed myself in my wonder how the historian who wrote them down\ncould have known them.\"\n\"I promise thee, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"the author of our history will be some sage enchanter; for to\nsuch nothing that they choose to write about is hidden.\"\n\"What!\" said Sancho, \"a sage and an enchanter! Why, the bachelor Samson Carrasco (that is the name of\nhim I spoke of) says the author of the history is called Cide Hamete Berengena.\"\n\"That is a Moorish name,\" said Don Quixote.\n\"May be so,\" replied Sancho; \"for I have heard say that the Moors are mostly great lovers of berengenas.\"\n\"Thou must have mistaken the surname of this 'Cide'--which means in Arabic 'Lord'--Sancho,\" observed\nDon Quixote.\n\"Very likely,\" replied Sancho, \"but if your worship wishes me to fetch the bachelor I will go for him in a\ntwinkling.\"\n\"Thou wilt do me a great pleasure, my friend,\" said Don Quixote, \"for what thou hast told me has amazed\nme, and I shall not eat a morsel that will agree with me until I have heard all about it.\"\n\"Then I am off for him,\" said Sancho; and leaving his master he went in quest of the bachelor, with whom\nhe returned in a short time, and, all three together, they had a very droll colloquy.\nCHAPTER III.\nOF THE LAUGHABLE CONVERSATION THAT PASSED BETWEEN DON QUIXOTE, SANCHO\nPANZA, AND THE BACHELOR SAMSON CARRASCO\nDon Quixote remained very deep in thought, waiting for the bachelor Carrasco, from whom he was to\nhear how he himself had been put into a book as Sancho said; and he could not persuade himself that any\nsuch history could be in existence, for the blood of the enemies he had slain was not yet dry on the blade\nof his sword, and now they wanted to make out that his mighty achievements were going about in print.\nFor all that, he fancied some sage, either a friend or an enemy, might, by the aid of magic, have given\nthem to the press; if a friend, in order to magnify and exalt them above the most famous ever achieved by\nany knight-errant; if an enemy, to bring them to naught and degrade them below the meanest ever\nrecorded of any low squire, though as he said to himself, the achievements of squires never were\nrecorded. If, however, it were the fact that such a history were in existence, it must necessarily, being the\nstory of a knight-errant, be grandiloquent, lofty, imposing, grand and true. With this he comforted himself\nsomewhat, though it made him uncomfortable to think that the author was a Moor, judging by the title of\n\"Cide;\" and that no truth was to be looked for from Moors, as they are all impostors, cheats, and\n-176\n\nschemers. He was afraid he might have dealt with his love affairs in some indecorous fashion, that might\ntend to the discredit and prejudice of the purity of his lady Dulcinea del Toboso; he would have had him\nset forth the fidelity and respect he had always observed towards her, spurning queens, empresses, and\ndamsels of all sorts, and keeping in check the impetuosity of his natural impulses. Absorbed and wrapped\nup in these and divers other cogitations, he was found by Sancho and Carrasco, whom Don Quixote\nreceived with great courtesy.\nThe bachelor, though he was called Samson, was of no great bodily size, but he was a very great wag; he\nwas of a sallow complexion, but very sharp-witted, somewhere about four-and-twenty years of age, with\na round face, a flat nose, and a large mouth, all indications of a mischievous disposition and a love of fun\nand jokes; and of this he gave a sample as soon as he saw Don Quixote, by falling on his knees before\nhim and saying, \"Let me kiss your mightiness's hand, Senor Don Quixote of La Mancha, for, by the habit\nof St. Peter that I wear, though I have no more than the first four orders, your worship is one of the most\nfamous knights-errant that have ever been, or will be, all the world over. A blessing on Cide Hamete\nBenengeli, who has written the history of your great deeds, and a double blessing on that connoisseur\nwho took the trouble of having it translated out of the Arabic into our Castilian vulgar tongue for the\nuniversal entertainment of the people!\"\nDon Quixote made him rise, and said, \"So, then, it is true that there is a history of me, and that it was a\nMoor and a sage who wrote it?\"\n\"So true is it, senor,\" said Samson, \"that my belief is there are more than twelve thousand volumes of the\nsaid history in print this very day. Only ask Portugal, Barcelona, and Valencia, where they have been\nprinted, and moreover there is a report that it is being printed at Antwerp, and I am persuaded there will\nnot be a country or language in which there will not be a translation of it.\"\n\"One of the things,\" here observed Don Quixote, \"that ought to give most pleasure to a virtuous and\neminent man is to find himself in his lifetime in print and in type, familiar in people's mouths with a good\nname; I say with a good name, for if it be the opposite, then there is no death to be compared to it.\"\n\"If it goes by good name and fame,\" said the bachelor, \"your worship alone bears away the palm from all\nthe knights-errant; for the Moor in his own language, and the Christian in his, have taken care to set\nbefore us your gallantry, your high courage in encountering dangers, your fortitude in adversity, your\npatience under misfortunes as well as wounds, the purity and continence of the platonic loves of your\nworship and my lady Dona Dulcinea del Toboso-\"\n\"I never heard my lady Dulcinea called Dona,\" observed Sancho here; \"nothing more than the lady\nDulcinea del Toboso; so here already the history is wrong.\"\n\"That is not an objection of any importance,\" replied Carrasco.\n\"Certainly not,\" said Don Quixote; \"but tell me, senor bachelor, what deeds of mine are they that are\nmade most of in this history?\"\n\"On that point,\" replied the bachelor, \"opinions differ, as tastes do; some swear by the adventure of the\nwindmills that your worship took to be Briareuses and giants; others by that of the fulling mills; one cries\nup the description of the two armies that afterwards took the appearance of two droves of sheep; another\nthat of the dead body on its way to be buried at Segovia; a third says the liberation of the galley slaves is\nthe best of all, and a fourth that nothing comes up to the affair with the Benedictine giants, and the battle\nwith the valiant Biscayan.\"\n-177\n\n\"Tell me, senor bachelor,\" said Sancho at this point, \"does the adventure with the Yanguesans come in,\nwhen our good Rocinante went hankering after dainties?\"\n\"The sage has left nothing in the ink-bottle,\" replied Samson; \"he tells all and sets down everything, even\nto the capers that worthy Sancho cut in the blanket.\"\n\"I cut no capers in the blanket,\" returned Sancho; \"in the air I did, and more of them than I liked.\"\n\"There is no human history in the world, I suppose,\" said Don Quixote, \"that has not its ups and downs,\nbut more than others such as deal with chivalry, for they can never be entirely made up of prosperous\nadventures.\"\n\"For all that,\" replied the bachelor, \"there are those who have read the history who say they would have\nbeen glad if the author had left out some of the countless cudgellings that were inflicted on Senor Don\nQuixote in various encounters.\"\n\"That's where the truth of the history comes in,\" said Sancho.\n\"At the same time they might fairly have passed them over in silence,\" observed Don Quixote; \"for there\nis no need of recording events which do not change or affect the truth of a history, if they tend to bring\nthe hero of it into contempt. AEneas was not in truth and earnest so pious as Virgil represents him, nor\nUlysses so wise as Homer describes him.\"\n\"That is true,\" said Samson; \"but it is one thing to write as a poet, another to write as a historian; the poet\nmay describe or sing things, not as they were, but as they ought to have been; but the historian has to\nwrite them down, not as they ought to have been, but as they were, without adding anything to the truth or\ntaking anything from it.\"\n\"Well then,\" said Sancho, \"if this senor Moor goes in for telling the truth, no doubt among my master's\ndrubbings mine are to be found; for they never took the measure of his worship's shoulders without doing\nthe same for my whole body; but I have no right to wonder at that, for, as my master himself says, the\nmembers must share the pain of the head.\"\n\"You are a sly dog, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote; \"i' faith, you have no want of memory when you choose\nto remember.\"\n\"If I were to try to forget the thwacks they gave me,\" said Sancho, \"my weals would not let me, for they\nare still fresh on my ribs.\"\n\"Hush, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"and don't interrupt the bachelor, whom I entreat to go on and tell all\nthat is said about me in this history.\"\n\"And about me,\" said Sancho, \"for they say, too, that I am one of the principal presonages in it.\"\n\"Personages, not presonages, friend Sancho,\" said Samson.\n\"What! Another word-catcher!\" said Sancho; \"if that's to be the way we shall not make an end in a\nlifetime.\"\n\"May God shorten mine, Sancho,\" returned the bachelor, \"if you are not the second person in the history,\nand there are even some who would rather hear you talk than the cleverest in the whole book; though\n-178\n\nthere are some, too, who say you showed yourself over-credulous in believing there was any possibility in\nthe government of that island offered you by Senor Don Quixote.\"\n\"There is still sunshine on the wall,\" said Don Quixote; \"and when Sancho is somewhat more advanced in\nlife, with the experience that years bring, he will be fitter and better qualified for being a governor than he\nis at present.\"\n\"By God, master,\" said Sancho, \"the island that I cannot govern with the years I have, I'll not be able to\ngovern with the years of Methuselah; the difficulty is that the said island keeps its distance somewhere, I\nknow not where; and not that there is any want of head in me to govern it.\"\n\"Leave it to God, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"for all will be and perhaps better than you think; no leaf\non the tree stirs but by God's will.\"\n\"That is true,\" said Samson; \"and if it be God's will, there will not be any want of a thousand islands,\nmuch less one, for Sancho to govern.\"\n\"I have seen governors in these parts,\" said Sancho, \"that are not to be compared to my shoe-sole; and for\nall that they are called 'your lordship' and served on silver.\"\n\"Those are not governors of islands,\" observed Samson, \"but of other governments of an easier kind:\nthose that govern islands must at least know grammar.\"\n\"I could manage the gram well enough,\" said Sancho; \"but for the mar I have neither leaning nor liking,\nfor I don't know what it is; but leaving this matter of the government in God's hands, to send me\nwherever it may be most to his service, I may tell you, senor bachelor Samson Carrasco, it has pleased me\nbeyond measure that the author of this history should have spoken of me in such a way that what is said\nof me gives no offence; for, on the faith of a true squire, if he had said anything about me that was at all\nunbecoming an old Christian, such as I am, the deaf would have heard of it.\"\n\"That would be working miracles,\" said Samson.\n\"Miracles or no miracles,\" said Sancho, \"let everyone mind how he speaks or writes about people, and not\nset down at random the first thing that comes into his head.\"\n\"One of the faults they find with this history,\" said the bachelor, \"is that its author inserted in it a novel\ncalled 'The Ill-advised Curiosity;' not that it is bad or ill-told, but that it is out of place and has nothing to\ndo with the history of his worship Senor Don Quixote.\"\n\"I will bet the son of a dog has mixed the cabbages and the baskets,\" said Sancho.\n\"Then, I say,\" said Don Quixote, \"the author of my history was no sage, but some ignorant chatterer,\nwho, in a haphazard and heedless way, set about writing it, let it turn out as it might, just as Orbaneja, the\npainter of Ubeda, used to do, who, when they asked him what he was painting, answered, 'What it may\nturn out.' Sometimes he would paint a cock in such a fashion, and so unlike, that he had to write\nalongside of it in Gothic letters, 'This is a cock; and so it will be with my history, which will require a\ncommentary to make it intelligible.\"\n\"No fear of that,\" returned Samson, \"for it is so plain that there is nothing in it to puzzle over; the children\nturn its leaves, the young people read it, the grown men understand it, the old folk praise it; in a word, it is\nso thumbed, and read, and got by heart by people of all sorts, that the instant they see any lean hack, they\n-179\n\nsay, 'There goes Rocinante.' And those that are most given to reading it are the pages, for there is not a\nlord's ante-chamber where there is not a 'Don Quixote' to be found; one takes it up if another lays it\ndown; this one pounces upon it, and that begs for it. In short, the said history is the most delightful and\nleast injurious entertainment that has been hitherto seen, for there is not to be found in the whole of it\neven the semblance of an immodest word, or a thought that is other than Catholic.\"\n\"To write in any other way,\" said Don Quixote, \"would not be to write truth, but falsehood, and historians\nwho have recourse to falsehood ought to be burned, like those who coin false money; and I know not\nwhat could have led the author to have recourse to novels and irrelevant stories, when he had so much to\nwrite about in mine; no doubt he must have gone by the proverb 'with straw or with hay, etc,' for by\nmerely setting forth my thoughts, my sighs, my tears, my lofty purposes, my enterprises, he might have\nmade a volume as large, or larger than all the works of El Tostado would make up. In fact, the conclusion\nI arrive at, senor bachelor, is, that to write histories, or books of any kind, there is need of great judgment\nand a ripe understanding. To give expression to humour, and write in a strain of graceful pleasantry, is the\ngift of great geniuses. The cleverest character in comedy is the clown, for he who would make people take\nhim for a fool, must not be one. History is in a measure a sacred thing, for it should be true, and where the\ntruth is, there God is; but notwithstanding this, there are some who write and fling books broadcast on the\nworld as if they were fritters.\"\n\"There is no book so bad but it has something good in it,\" said the bachelor.\n\"No doubt of that,\" replied Don Quixote; \"but it often happens that those who have acquired and attained\na well-deserved reputation by their writings, lose it entirely, or damage it in some degree, when they give\nthem to the press.\"\n\"The reason of that,\" said Samson, \"is, that as printed works are examined leisurely, their faults are easily\nseen; and the greater the fame of the writer, the more closely are they scrutinised. Men famous for their\ngenius, great poets, illustrious historians, are always, or most commonly, envied by those who take a\nparticular delight and pleasure in criticising the writings of others, without having produced any of their\nown.\"\n\"That is no wonder,\" said Don Quixote; \"for there are many divines who are no good for the pulpit, but\nexcellent in detecting the defects or excesses of those who preach.\"\n\"All that is true, Senor Don Quixote,\" said Carrasco; \"but I wish such fault-finders were more lenient and\nless exacting, and did not pay so much attention to the spots on the bright sun of the work they grumble\nat; for if aliquando bonus dormitat Homerus, they should remember how long he remained awake to shed\nthe light of his work with as little shade as possible; and perhaps it may be that what they find fault with\nmay be moles, that sometimes heighten the beauty of the face that bears them; and so I say very great is\nthe risk to which he who prints a book exposes himself, for of all impossibilities the greatest is to write\none that will satisfy and please all readers.\"\n\"That which treats of me must have pleased few,\" said Don Quixote.\n\"Quite the contrary,\" said the bachelor; \"for, as stultorum infinitum est numerus, innumerable are those\nwho have relished the said history; but some have brought a charge against the author's memory,\ninasmuch as he forgot to say who the thief was who stole Sancho's Dapple; for it is not stated there, but\nonly to be inferred from what is set down, that he was stolen, and a little farther on we see Sancho\nmounted on the same ass, without any reappearance of it. They say, too, that he forgot to state what\nSancho did with those hundred crowns that he found in the valise in the Sierra Morena, as he never\nalludes to them again, and there are many who would be glad to know what he did with them, or what he\n-180\n\nspent them on, for it is one of the serious omissions of the work.\"\n\"Senor Samson, I am not in a humour now for going into accounts or explanations,\" said Sancho; \"for\nthere's a sinking of the stomach come over me, and unless I doctor it with a couple of sups of the old stuff\nit will put me on the thorn of Santa Lucia. I have it at home, and my old woman is waiting for me; after\ndinner I'll come back, and will answer you and all the world every question you may choose to ask, as\nwell about the loss of the ass as about the spending of the hundred crowns;\" and without another word or\nwaiting for a reply he made off home.\n-181"

Reading over your magnificent defence, my work has acquired\nfor myself, as it were, an unexpected authority.\nAccept, then, here, the homage of my gratitude, which, how great soever it is, will never attain\nthe height of your eloquence and your devotion.\nGustave Flaubert\nParis, 12 April 1857\n\nPART I\nChapter One\nWe were in class when the head-master came in, followed by a \"new fellow,\" not wearing the school\nuniform, and a school servant carrying a large desk. Those who had been asleep woke up, and every one\nrose as if just surprised at his work.\nThe head-master made a sign to us to sit down. Then, turning to the class-master, he said to him in a low\nvoice--\n\"Monsieur Roger, here is a pupil whom I recommend to your care; he'll be in the second. If his work and\nconduct are satisfactory, he will go into one of the upper classes, as becomes his age.\"\nThe \"new fellow,\" standing in the corner behind the door so that he could hardly be seen, was a country\nlad of about fifteen, and taller than any of us. His hair was cut square on his forehead like a village\nchorister's; he looked reliable, but very ill at ease. Although he was not broad-shouldered, his short\nschool jacket of green cloth with black buttons must have been tight about the arm-holes, and showed at\nthe opening of the cuffs red wrists accustomed to being bare. His legs, in blue stockings, looked out from\nbeneath yellow trousers, drawn tight by braces, He wore stout, ill-cleaned, hob-nailed boots.\nWe began repeating the lesson. He listened with all his ears, as attentive as if at a sermon, not daring even\nto cross his legs or lean on his elbow; and when at two o'clock the bell rang, the master was obliged to\ntell him to fall into line with the rest of us.\nWhen we came back to work, we were in the habit of throwing our caps on the ground so as to have our\nhands more free; we used from the door to toss them under the form, so that they hit against the wall and\nmade a lot of dust: it was \"the thing.\"\nBut, whether he had not noticed the trick, or did not dare to attempt it, the \"new fellow,\" was still holding\nhis cap on his knees even after prayers were over. It was one of those head-gears of composite order, in\nwhich we can find traces of the bearskin, shako, billycock hat, sealskin cap, and cotton night-cap; one of\nthose poor things, in fine, whose dumb ugliness has depths of expression, like an imbecile's face. Oval,\nstiffened with whalebone, it began with three round knobs; then came in succession lozenges of velvet\nand rabbit-skin separated by a red band; after that a sort of bag that ended in a cardboard polygon covered\nwith complicated braiding, from which hung, at the end of a long thin cord, small twisted gold threads in\nthe manner of a tassel. The cap was new; its peak shone.\n\"Rise,\" said the master.\nHe stood up; his cap fell. The whole class began to laugh. He stooped to pick it up. A neighbor knocked it\ndown again with his elbow; he picked it up once more.\n\"Get rid of your helmet,\" said the master, who was a bit of a wag.\nThere was a burst of laughter from the boys, which so thoroughly put the poor lad out of countenance that\nhe did not know whether to keep his cap in his hand, leave it on the ground, or put it on his head. He sat\ndown again and placed it on his knee.\n-1\n\n\"Rise,\" repeated the master, \"and tell me your name.\"\nThe new boy articulated in a stammering voice an unintelligible name.\n\"Again!\"\nThe same sputtering of syllables was heard, drowned by the tittering of the class.\n\"Louder!\" cried the master; \"louder!\"\nThe \"new fellow\" then took a supreme resolution, opened an inordinately large mouth, and shouted at the\ntop of his voice as if calling someone in the word \"Charbovari.\"\nA hubbub broke out, rose in crescendo with bursts of shrill voices (they yelled, barked, stamped, repeated\n\"Charbovari! Charbovari\"), then died away into single notes, growing quieter only with great difficulty,\nand now and again suddenly recommencing along the line of a form whence rose here and there, like a\ndamp cracker going off, a stifled laugh.\nHowever, amid a rain of impositions, order was gradually re-established in the class; and the master\nhaving succeeded in catching the name of \"Charles Bovary,\" having had it dictated to him, spelt out, and\nre-read, at once ordered the poor devil to go and sit down on the punishment form at the foot of the\nmaster's desk. He got up, but before going hesitated.\n\"What are you looking for?\" asked the master.\n\"My c-a-p,\" timidly said the \"new fellow,\" casting troubled looks round him.\n\"Five hundred lines for all the class!\" shouted in a furious voice stopped, like the Quos ego[1], a fresh\noutburst. \"Silence!\" continued the master indignantly, wiping his brow with his handkerchief, which he\nhad just taken from his cap. \"As to you, 'new boy,' you will conjugate 'ridiculus sum'[2] twenty times.\"\nThen, in a gentler tone, \"Come, you'll find your cap again; it hasn't been stolen.\"\n[1]A quotation from the Aeneid signifying a threat.\n[2]I am ridiculous.\nQuiet was restored. Heads bent over desks, and the \"new fellow\" remained for two hours in an exemplary\nattitude, although from time to time some paper pellet flipped from the tip of a pen came bang in his face.\nBut he wiped his face with one hand and continued motionless, his eyes lowered.\nIn the evening, at preparation, he pulled out his pens from his desk, arranged his small belongings, and\ncarefully ruled his paper. We saw him working conscientiously, looking up every word in the dictionary,\nand taking the greatest pains. Thanks, no doubt, to the willingness he showed, he had not to go down to\nthe class below. But though he knew his rules passably, he had little finish in composition. It was the cure\nof his village who had taught him his first Latin; his parents, from motives of economy, having sent him\nto school as late as possible.\nHis father, Monsieur Charles Denis Bartolome Bovary, retired assistant-surgeon-major, compromised\nabout 1812 in certain conscription scandals, and forced at this time to leave the service, had taken\nadvantage of his fine figure to get hold of a dowry of sixty thousand francs that offered in the person of a\n-2\n\nhosier's daughter who had fallen in love with his good looks. A fine man, a great talker, making his spurs\nring as he walked, wearing whiskers that ran into his moustache, his fingers always garnished with rings\nand dressed in loud colours, he had the dash of a military man with the easy go of a commercial traveller.\nOnce married, he lived for three or four years on his wife's fortune, dining well, rising late, smoking long\nporcelain pipes, not coming in at night till after the theatre, and haunting cafes. The father-in-law died,\nleaving little; he was indignant at this, \"went in for the business,\" lost some money in it, then retired to\nthe country, where he thought he would make money.\nBut, as he knew no more about farming than calico, as he rode his horses instead of sending them to\nplough, drank his cider in bottle instead of selling it in cask, ate the finest poultry in his farmyard, and\ngreased his hunting-boots with the fat of his pigs, he was not long in finding out that he would do better\nto give up all speculation.\nFor two hundred francs a year he managed to live on the border of the provinces of Caux and Picardy, in\na kind of place half farm, half private house; and here, soured, eaten up with regrets, cursing his luck,\njealous of everyone, he shut himself up at the age of forty-five, sick of men, he said, and determined to\nlive at peace.\nHis wife had adored him once on a time; she had bored him with a thousand servilities that had only\nestranged him the more. Lively once, expansive and affectionate, in growing older she had become (after\nthe fashion of wine that, exposed to air, turns to vinegar) ill-tempered, grumbling, irritable. She had\nsuffered so much without complaint at first, until she had seem him going after all the village drabs, and\nuntil a score of bad houses sent him back to her at night, weary, stinking drunk. Then her pride revolted.\nAfter that she was silent, burying her anger in a dumb stoicism that she maintained till her death. She was\nconstantly going about looking after business matters. She called on the lawyers, the president,\nremembered when bills fell due, got them renewed, and at home ironed, sewed, washed, looked after the\nworkmen, paid the accounts, while he, troubling himself about nothing, eternally besotted in sleepy\nsulkiness, whence he only roused himself to say disagreeable things to her, sat smoking by the fire and\nspitting into the cinders.\nWhen she had a child, it had to be sent out to nurse. When he came home, the lad was spoilt as if he were\na prince. His mother stuffed him with jam; his father let him run about barefoot, and, playing the\nphilosopher, even said he might as well go about quite naked like the young of animals. As opposed to\nthe maternal ideas, he had a certain virile idea of childhood on which he sought to mould his son, wishing\nhim to be brought up hardily, like a Spartan, to give him a strong constitution. He sent him to bed without\nany fire, taught him to drink off large draughts of rum and to jeer at religious processions. But, peaceable\nby nature, the lad answered only poorly to his notions. His mother always kept him near her; she cut out\ncardboard for him, told him tales, entertained him with endless monologues full of melancholy gaiety and\ncharming nonsense. In her life's isolation she centered on the child's head all her shattered, broken little\nvanities. She dreamed of high station; she already saw him, tall, handsome, clever, settled as an engineer\nor in the law. She taught him to read, and even, on an old piano, she had taught him two or three little\nsongs. But to all this Monsieur Bovary, caring little for letters, said, \"It was not worth while. Would they\never have the means to send him to a public school, to buy him a practice, or start him in business?\nBesides, with cheek a man always gets on in the world.\" Madame Bovary bit her lips, and the child\nknocked about the village.\nHe went after the labourers, drove away with clods of earth the ravens that were flying about. He ate\nblackberries along the hedges, minded the geese with a long switch, went haymaking during harvest, ran\nabout in the woods, played hop-scotch under the church porch on rainy days, and at great fetes begged the\nbeadle to let him toll the bells, that he might hang all his weight on the long rope and feel himself borne\n-3\n\nupward by it in its swing. Meanwhile he grew like an oak; he was strong on hand, fresh of colour.\nWhen he was twelve years old his mother had her own way; he began lessons. The cure took him in hand;\nbut the lessons were so short and irregular that they could not be of much use. They were given at spare\nmoments in the sacristy, standing up, hurriedly, between a baptism and a burial; or else the cure, if he had\nnot to go out, sent for his pupil after the Angelus[3]. They went up to his room and settled down; the flies\nand moths fluttered round the candle. It was close, the child fell asleep, and the good man, beginning to\ndoze with his hands on his stomach, was soon snoring with his mouth wide open. On other occasions,\nwhen Monsieur le Cure, on his way back after administering the viaticum to some sick person in the\nneighbourhood, caught sight of Charles playing about the fields, he called him, lectured him for a quarter\nof an hour and took advantage of the occasion to make him conjugate his verb at the foot of a tree. The\nrain interrupted them or an acquaintance passed. All the same he was always pleased with him, and even\nsaid the \"young man\" had a very good memory.\n[3]A devotion said at morning, noon, and evening, at the sound of a bell. Here, the evening prayer.\nCharles could not go on like this. Madame Bovary took strong steps. Ashamed, or rather tired out,\nMonsieur Bovary gave in without a struggle, and they waited one year longer, so that the lad should take\nhis first communion.\nSix months more passed, and the year after Charles was finally sent to school at Rouen, where his father\ntook him towards the end of October, at the time of the St. Romain fair.\nIt would now be impossible for any of us to remember anything about him. He was a youth of even\ntemperament, who played in playtime, worked in school-hours, was attentive in class, slept well in the\ndormitory, and ate well in the refectory. He had in loco parentis[4] a wholesale ironmonger in the Rue\nGanterie, who took him out once a month on Sundays after his shop was shut, sent him for a walk on the\nquay to look at the boats, and then brought him back to college at seven o'clock before supper. Every\nThursday evening he wrote a long letter to his mother with red ink and three wafers; then he went over his\nhistory note-books, or read an old volume of \"Anarchasis\" that was knocking about the study. When he\nwent for walks he talked to the servant, who, like himself, came from the country.\n[4]In place of a parent.\nBy dint of hard work he kept always about the middle of the class; once even he got a certificate in\nnatural history. But at the end of his third year his parents withdrew him from the school to make him\nstudy medicine, convinced that he could even take his degree by himself.\nHis mother chose a room for him on the fourth floor of a dyer's she knew, overlooking the Eau-de-Robec.\nShe made arrangements for his board, got him furniture, table and two chairs, sent home for an old\ncherry-tree bedstead, and bought besides a small cast-iron stove with the supply of wood that was to\nwarm the poor child.\nThen at the end of a week she departed, after a thousand injunctions to be good now that he was going to\nbe left to himself.\nThe syllabus that he read on the notice-board stunned him; lectures on anatomy, lectures on pathology,\nlectures on physiology, lectures on pharmacy, lectures on botany and clinical medicine, and therapeutics,\nwithout counting hygiene and materia medica--all names of whose etymologies he was ignorant, and that\nwere to him as so many doors to sanctuaries filled with magnificent darkness.\n-4\n\nHe understood nothing of it all; it was all very well to listen-- he did not follow. Still he worked; he had\nbound note-books, he attended all the courses, never missed a single lecture. He did his little daily task\nlike a mill-horse, who goes round and round with his eyes bandaged, not knowing what work he is doing.\nTo spare him expense his mother sent him every week by the carrier a piece of veal baked in the oven,\nwith which he lunched when he came back from the hospital, while he sat kicking his feet against the\nwall. After this he had to run off to lectures, to the operation-room, to the hospital, and return to his home\nat the other end of the town. In the evening, after the poor dinner of his landlord, he went back to his\nroom and set to work again in his wet clothes, which smoked as he sat in front of the hot stove.\nOn the fine summer evenings, at the time when the close streets are empty, when the servants are playing\nshuttle-cock at the doors, he opened his window and leaned out. The river, that makes of this quarter of\nRouen a wretched little Venice, flowed beneath him, between the bridges and the railings, yellow, violet,\nor blue. Working men, kneeling on the banks, washed their bare arms in the water. On poles projecting\nfrom the attics, skeins of cotton were drying in the air. Opposite, beyond the roots spread the pure heaven\nwith the red sun setting. How pleasant it must be at home! How fresh under the beech-tree! And he\nexpanded his nostrils to breathe in the sweet odours of the country which did not reach him.\nHe grew thin, his figure became taller, his face took a saddened look that made it nearly interesting.\nNaturally, through indifference, he abandoned all the resolutions he had made. Once he missed a lecture;\nthe next day all the lectures; and, enjoying his idleness, little by little, he gave up work altogether. He got\ninto the habit of going to the public-house, and had a passion for dominoes. To shut himself up every\nevening in the dirty public room, to push about on marble tables the small sheep bones with black dots,\nseemed to him a fine proof of his freedom, which raised him in his own esteem. It was beginning to see\nlife, the sweetness of stolen pleasures; and when he entered, he put his hand on the door-handle with a joy\nalmost sensual. Then many things hidden within him came out; he learnt couplets by heart and sang them\nto his boon companions, became enthusiastic about Beranger, learnt how to make punch, and, finally,\nhow to make love.\nThanks to these preparatory labours, he failed completely in his examination for an ordinary degree. He\nwas expected home the same night to celebrate his success. He started on foot, stopped at the beginning of\nthe village, sent for his mother, and told her all. She excused him, threw the blame of his failure on the\ninjustice of the examiners, encouraged him a little, and took upon herself to set matters straight. It was\nonly five years later that Monsieur Bovary knew the truth; it was old then, and he accepted it. Moreover,\nhe could not believe that a man born of him could be a fool.\nSo Charles set to work again and crammed for his examination, ceaselessly learning all the old questions\nby heart. He passed pretty well. What a happy day for his mother! They gave a grand dinner.\nWhere should he go to practice? To Tostes, where there was only one old doctor. For a long time\nMadame Bovary had been on the look-out for his death, and the old fellow had barely been packed off\nwhen Charles was installed, opposite his place, as his successor.\nBut it was not everything to have brought up a son, to have had him taught medicine, and discovered\nTostes, where he could practice it; he must have a wife. She found him one--the widow of a bailiff at\nDieppe--who was forty-five and had an income of twelve hundred francs. Though she was ugly, as dry as\na bone, her face with as many pimples as the spring has buds, Madame Dubuc had no lack of suitors. To\nattain her ends Madame Bovary had to oust them all, and she even succeeded in very cleverly baffling the\nintrigues of a port-butcher backed up by the priests.\nCharles had seen in marriage the advent of an easier life, thinking he would be more free to do as he liked\n-5\n\nwith himself and his money. But his wife was master; he had to say this and not say that in company, to\nfast every Friday, dress as she liked, harass at her bidding those patients who did not pay. She opened his\nletter, watched his comings and goings, and listened at the partition-wall when women came to consult\nhim in his surgery.\nShe must have her chocolate every morning, attentions without end. She constantly complained of her\nnerves, her chest, her liver. The noise of footsteps made her ill; when people left her, solitude became\nodious to her; if they came back, it was doubtless to see her die. When Charles returned in the evening,\nshe stretched forth two long thin arms from beneath the sheets, put them round his neck, and having made\nhim sit down on the edge of the bed, began to talk to him of her troubles: he was neglecting her, he loved\nanother. She had been warned she would be unhappy; and she ended by asking him for a dose of\nmedicine and a little more love.\nChapter Two\nOne night towards eleven o'clock they were awakened by the noise of a horse pulling up outside their\ndoor. The servant opened the garret-window and parleyed for some time with a man in the street below.\nHe came for the doctor, had a letter for him. Natasie came downstairs shivering and undid the bars and\nbolts one after the other. The man left his horse, and, following the servant, suddenly came in behind her.\nHe pulled out from his wool cap with grey top-knots a letter wrapped up in a rag and presented it gingerly\nto Charles, who rested on his elbow on the pillow to read it. Natasie, standing near the bed, held the light.\nMadame in modesty had turned to the wall and showed only her back.\nThis letter, sealed with a small seal in blue wax, begged Monsieur Bovary to come immediately to the\nfarm of the Bertaux to set a broken leg. Now from Tostes to the Bertaux was a good eighteen miles across\ncountry by way of Longueville and Saint-Victor. It was a dark night; Madame Bovary junior was afraid\nof accidents for her husband. So it was decided the stable-boy should go on first; Charles would start\nthree hours later when the moon rose. A boy was to be sent to meet him, and show him the way to the\nfarm, and open the gates for him.\nTowards four o'clock in the morning, Charles, well wrapped up in his cloak, set out for the Bertaux. Still\nsleepy from the warmth of his bed, he let himself be lulled by the quiet trot of his horse. When it stopped\nof its own accord in front of those holes surrounded with thorns that are dug on the margin of furrows,\nCharles awoke with a start, suddenly remembered the broken leg, and tried to call to mind all the fractures\nhe knew. The rain had stopped, day was breaking, and on the branches of the leafless trees birds roosted\nmotionless, their little feathers bristling in the cold morning wind. The flat country stretched as far as eye\ncould see, and the tufts of trees round the farms at long intervals seemed like dark violet stains on the cast\ngrey surface, that on the horizon faded into the gloom of the sky.\nCharles from time to time opened his eyes, his mind grew weary, and, sleep coming upon him, he soon\nfell into a doze wherein, his recent sensations blending with memories, he became conscious of a double\nself, at once student and married man, lying in his bed as but now, and crossing the operation theatre as of\nold. The warm smell of poultices mingled in his brain with the fresh odour of dew; he heard the iron rings\nrattling along the curtain-rods of the bed and saw his wife sleeping. As he passed Vassonville he came\nupon a boy sitting on the grass at the edge of a ditch.\n\"Are you the doctor?\" asked the child.\nAnd on Charles's answer he took his wooden shoes in his hands and ran on in front of him.\nThe general practitioner, riding along, gathered from his guide's talk that Monsieur Rouault must be one\nof the well-to-do farmers.\n-6\n\nHe had broken his leg the evening before on his way home from a Twelfth-night feast at a neighbour's.\nHis wife had been dead for two years. There was with him only his daughter, who helped him to keep\nhouse.\nThe ruts were becoming deeper; they were approaching the Bertaux.\nThe little lad, slipping through a hole in the hedge, disappeared; then he came back to the end of a\ncourtyard to open the gate. The horse slipped on the wet grass; Charles had to stoop to pass under the\nbranches. The watchdogs in their kennels barked, dragging at their chains. As he entered the Bertaux, the\nhorse took fright and stumbled.\nIt was a substantial-looking farm. In the stables, over the top of the open doors, one could see great\ncart-horses quietly feeding from new racks. Right along the outbuildings extended a large dunghill, from\nwhich manure liquid oozed, while amidst fowls and turkeys, five or six peacocks, a luxury in Chauchois\nfarmyards, were foraging on the top of it. The sheepfold was long, the barn high, with walls smooth as\nyour hand. Under the cart-shed were two large carts and four ploughs, with their whips, shafts and\nharnesses complete, whose fleeces of blue wool were getting soiled by the fine dust that fell from the\ngranaries. The courtyard sloped upwards, planted with trees set out symmetrically, and the chattering\nnoise of a flock of geese was heard near the pond.\nA young woman in a blue merino dress with three flounces came to the threshold of the door to receive\nMonsieur Bovary, whom she led to the kitchen, where a large fire was blazing. The servant's breakfast\nwas boiling beside it in small pots of all sizes. Some damp clothes were drying inside the chimney-corner.\nThe shovel, tongs, and the nozzle of the bellows, all of colossal size, shone like polished steel, while\nalong the walls hung many pots and pans in which the clear flame of the hearth, mingling with the first\nrays of the sun coming in through the window, was mirrored fitfully.\nCharles went up the first floor to see the patient. He found him in his bed, sweating under his bed-clothes,\nhaving thrown his cotton nightcap right away from him. He was a fat little man of fifty, with white skin\nand blue eyes, the forepart of his head bald, and he wore earrings. By his side on a chair stood a large\ndecanter of brandy, whence he poured himself a little from time to time to keep up his spirits; but as soon\nas he caught sight of the doctor his elation subsided, and instead of swearing, as he had been doing for the\nlast twelve hours, began to groan freely.\nThe fracture was a simple one, without any kind of complication.\nCharles could not have hoped for an easier case. Then calling to mind the devices of his masters at the\nbedsides of patients, he comforted the sufferer with all sorts of kindly remarks, those Caresses of the\nsurgeon that are like the oil they put on bistouries. In order to make some splints a bundle of laths was\nbrought up from the cart-house. Charles selected one, cut it into two pieces and planed it with a fragment\nof windowpane, while the servant tore up sheets to make bandages, and Mademoiselle Emma tried to sew\nsome pads. As she was a long time before she found her work-case, her father grew impatient; she did not\nanswer, but as she sewed she pricked her fingers, which she then put to her mouth to suck them. Charles\nwas surprised at the whiteness of her nails. They were shiny, delicate at the tips, more polished than the\nivory of Dieppe, and almond-shaped. Yet her hand was not beautiful, perhaps not white enough, and a\nlittle hard at the knuckles; besides, it was too long, with no soft inflections in the outlines. Her real beauty\nwas in her eyes. Although brown, they seemed black because of the lashes, and her look came at you\nfrankly, with a candid boldness.\nThe bandaging over, the doctor was invited by Monsieur Rouault himself to \"pick a bit\" before he left.\n-7\n\nCharles went down into the room on the ground floor. Knives and forks and silver goblets were laid for\ntwo on a little table at the foot of a huge bed that had a canopy of printed cotton with figures representing\nTurks. There was an odour of iris-root and damp sheets that escaped from a large oak chest opposite the\nwindow. On the floor in corners were sacks of flour stuck upright in rows. These were the overflow from\nthe neighbouring granary, to which three stone steps led. By way of decoration for the apartment, hanging\nto a nail in the middle of the wall, whose green paint scaled off from the effects of the saltpetre, was a\ncrayon head of Minerva in gold frame, underneath which was written in Gothic letters \"To dear Papa.\"\nFirst they spoke of the patient, then of the weather, of the great cold, of the wolves that infested the fields\nat night.\nMademoiselle Rouault did not at all like the country, especially now that she had to look after the farm\nalmost alone. As the room was chilly, she shivered as she ate. This showed something of her full lips, that\nshe had a habit of biting when silent.\nHer neck stood out from a white turned-down collar. Her hair, whose two black folds seemed each of a\nsingle piece, so smooth were they, was parted in the middle by a delicate lie that curved slightly with the\ncurve of the head; and, just showing the tip of the ear, it was joined behind in a thick chignon, with a\nwavy movement at the temples that the country doctor saw now for the first time in his life. The upper\npart of her cheek was rose-coloured. She had, like a man, thrust in between two buttons of her bodice a\ntortoise-shell eyeglass.\nWhen Charles, after bidding farewell to old Rouault, returned to the room before leaving, he found her\nstanding, her forehead against the window, looking into the garden, where the bean props had been\nknocked down by the wind. She turned round. \"Are you looking for anything?\" she asked.\n\"My whip, if you please,\" he answered.\nHe began rummaging on the bed, behind the doors, under the chairs. It had fallen to the floor, between the\nsacks and the wall. Mademoiselle Emma saw it, and bent over the flour sacks.\nCharles out of politeness made a dash also, and as he stretched out his arm, at the same moment felt his\nbreast brush against the back of the young girl bending beneath him. She drew herself up, scarlet, and\nlooked at him over her shoulder as she handed him his whip.\nInstead of returning to the Bertaux in three days as he had promised, he went back the very next day, then\nregularly twice a week, without counting the visits he paid now and then as if by accident.\nEverything, moreover, went well; the patient progressed favourably; and when, at the end of forty-six\ndays, old Rouault was seen trying to walk alone in his \"den,\" Monsieur Bovary began to be looked upon\nas a man of great capacity. Old Rouault said that he could not have been cured better by the first doctor of\nYvetot, or even of Rouen.\nAs to Charles, he did not stop to ask himself why it was a pleasure to him to go to the Bertaux. Had he\ndone so, he would, no doubt, have attributed his zeal to the importance of the case, or perhaps to the\nmoney he hoped to make by it. Was it for this, however, that his visits to the farm formed a delightful\nexception to the meagre occupations of his life? On these days he rose early, set off at a gallop, urging on\nhis horse, then got down to wipe his boots in the grass and put on black gloves before entering. He liked\ngoing into the courtyard, and noticing the gate turn against his shoulder, the cock crow on the wall, the\nlads run to meet him. He liked the granary and the stables; he liked old Rouault, who pressed his hand and\ncalled him his saviour; he like the small wooden shoes of Mademoiselle Emma on the scoured flags of the\n-8\n\nkitchen--her high heels made her a little taller; and when she walked in front of him, the wooden soles\nspringing up quickly struck with a sharp sound against the leather of her boots.\nShe always accompanied him to the first step of the stairs. When his horse had not yet been brought round\nshe stayed there. They had said \"Good-bye\"; there was no more talking. The open air wrapped her round,\nplaying with the soft down on the back of her neck, or blew to and fro on her hips the apron-strings, that\nfluttered like streamers. Once, during a thaw the bark of the trees in the yard was oozing, the snow on the\nroofs of the outbuildings was melting; she stood on the threshold, and went to fetch her sunshade and\nopened it. The sunshade of silk of the colour of pigeons' breasts, through which the sun shone, lighted up\nwith shifting hues the white skin of her face. She smiled under the tender warmth, and drops of water\ncould be heard falling one by one on the stretched silk.\nDuring the first period of Charles's visits to the Bertaux, Madame Bovary junior never failed to inquire\nafter the invalid, and she had even chosen in the book that she kept on a system of double entry a clean\nblank page for Monsieur Rouault. But when she heard he had a daughter, she began to make inquiries,\nand she learnt the Mademoiselle Rouault, brought up at the Ursuline Convent, had received what is called\n\"a good education\"; and so knew dancing, geography, drawing, how to embroider and play the piano.\nThat was the last straw.\n\"So it is for this,\" she said to herself, \"that his face beams when he goes to see her, and that he puts on his\nnew waistcoat at the risk of spoiling it with the rain. Ah! that woman! That woman!\"\nAnd she detested her instinctively. At first she solaced herself by allusions that Charles did not\nunderstand, then by casual observations that he let pass for fear of a storm, finally by open apostrophes to\nwhich he knew not what to answer. \"Why did he go back to the Bertaux now that Monsieur Rouault was\ncured and that these folks hadn't paid yet? Ah! it was because a young lady was there, some one who\nknow how to talk, to embroider, to be witty. That was what he cared about; he wanted town misses.\" And\nshe went on--\n\"The daughter of old Rouault a town miss! Get out! Their grandfather was a shepherd, and they have a\ncousin who was almost had up at the assizes for a nasty blow in a quarrel. It is not worth while making\nsuch a fuss, or showing herself at church on Sundays in a silk gown like a countess. Besides, the poor old\nchap, if it hadn't been for the colza last year, would have had much ado to pay up his arrears.\"\nFor very weariness Charles left off going to the Bertaux. Heloise made him swear, his hand on the\nprayer-book, that he would go there no more after much sobbing and many kisses, in a great outburst of\nlove. He obeyed then, but the strength of his desire protested against the servility of his conduct; and he\nthought, with a kind of naive hypocrisy, that his interdict to see her gave him a sort of right to love her.\nAnd then the widow was thin; she had long teeth; wore in all weathers a little black shawl, the edge of\nwhich hung down between her shoulder-blades; her bony figure was sheathed in her clothes as if they\nwere a scabbard; they were too short, and displayed her ankles with the laces of her large boots crossed\nover grey stockings.\nCharles's mother came to see them from time to time, but after a few days the daughter-in-law seemed to\nput her own edge on her, and then, like two knives, they scarified him with their reflections and\nobservations. It was wrong of him to eat so much.\nWhy did he always offer a glass of something to everyone who came? What obstinacy not to wear\nflannels! In the spring it came about that a notary at Ingouville, the holder of the widow Dubuc's\nproperty, one fine day went off, taking with him all the money in his office. Heloise, it is true, still\npossessed, besides a share in a boat valued at six thousand francs, her house in the Rue St. Francois; and\n-9\n\nyet, with all this fortune that had been so trumpeted abroad, nothing, excepting perhaps a little furniture\nand a few clothes, had appeared in the household. The matter had to be gone into. The house at Dieppe\nwas found to be eaten up with mortgages to its foundations; what she had placed with the notary God\nonly knew, and her share in the boat did not exceed one thousand crowns. She had lied, the good lady! In\nhis exasperation, Monsieur Bovary the elder, smashing a chair on the flags, accused his wife of having\ncaused misfortune to the son by harnessing him to such a harridan, whose harness wasn't worth her hide.\nThey came to Tostes. Explanations followed. There were scenes. Heloise in tears, throwing her arms\nabout her husband, implored him to defend her from his parents.\nCharles tried to speak up for her. They grew angry and left the house.\nBut \"the blow had struck home.\" A week after, as she was hanging up some washing in her yard, she was\nseized with a spitting of blood, and the next day, while Charles had his back turned to her drawing the\nwindow-curtain, she said, \"O God!\" gave a sigh and fainted. She was dead! What a surprise! When all\nwas over at the cemetery Charles went home. He found no one downstairs; he went up to the first floor to\ntheir room; say her dress still hanging at the foot of the alcove; then, leaning against the writing-table, he\nstayed until the evening, buried in a sorrowful reverie. She had loved him after all!\nChapter Three\nOne morning old Rouault brought Charles the money for setting his leg--seventy-five francs in forty-sou\npieces, and a turkey. He had heard of his loss, and consoled him as well as he could.\n\"I know what it is,\" said he, clapping him on the shoulder; \"I've been through it. When I lost my dear\ndeparted, I went into the fields to be quite alone. I fell at the foot of a tree; I cried; I called on God; I\ntalked nonsense to Him. I wanted to be like the moles that I saw on the branches, their insides swarming\nwith worms, dead, and an end of it. And when I thought that there were others at that very moment with\ntheir nice little wives holding them in their embrace, I struck great blows on the earth with my stick. I was\npretty well mad with not eating; the very idea of going to a cafe disgusted me--you wouldn't believe it.\nWell, quite softly, one day following another, a spring on a winter, and an autumn after a summer, this\nwore away, piece by piece, crumb by crumb; it passed away, it is gone, I should say it has sunk; for\nsomething always remains at the bottom as one would say--a weight here, at one's heart. But since it is\nthe lot of all of us, one must not give way altogether, and, because others have died, want to die too. You\nmust pull yourself together, Monsieur Bovary. It will pass away. Come to see us; my daughter thinks of\nyou now and again, d'ye know, and she says you are forgetting her. Spring will soon be here. We'll have\nsome rabbit-shooting in the warrens to amuse you a bit.\"\nCharles followed his advice. He went back to the Bertaux. He found all as he had left it, that is to say, as\nit was five months ago. The pear trees were already in blossom, and Farmer Rouault, on his legs again,\ncame and went, making the farm more full of life.\nThinking it his duty to heap the greatest attention upon the doctor because of his sad position, he begged\nhim not to take his hat off, spoke to him in an undertone as if he had been ill, and even pretended to be\nangry because nothing rather lighter had been prepared for him than for the others, such as a little clotted\ncream or stewed pears. He told stories. Charles found himself laughing, but the remembrance of his wife\nsuddenly coming back to him depressed him. Coffee was brought in; he thought no more about her.\nHe thought less of her as he grew accustomed to living alone. The new delight of independence soon\nmade his loneliness bearable. He could now change his meal-times, go in or out without explanation, and\nwhen he was very tired stretch himself at full length on his bed. So he nursed and coddled himself and\naccepted the consolations that were offered him. On the other hand, the death of his wife had not served\nhim ill in his business, since for a month people had been saying, \"The poor young man! what a loss!\"\n-10\n\nHis name had been talked about, his practice had increased; and moreover, he could go to the Bertaux just\nas he liked. He had an aimless hope, and was vaguely happy; he thought himself better looking as he\nbrushed his whiskers before the looking-glass.\nOne day he got there about three o'clock. Everybody was in the fields. He went into the kitchen, but did\nnot at once catch sight of Emma; the outside shutters were closed. Through the chinks of the wood the\nsun sent across the flooring long fine rays that were broken at the corners of the furniture and trembled\nalong the ceiling. Some flies on the table were crawling up the glasses that had been used, and buzzing as\nthey drowned themselves in the dregs of the cider. The daylight that came in by the chimney made velvet\nof the soot at the back of the fireplace, and touched with blue the cold cinders. Between the window and\nthe hearth Emma was sewing; she wore no fichu; he could see small drops of perspiration on her bare\nshoulders.\nAfter the fashion of country folks she asked him to have something to drink. He said no; she insisted, and\nat last laughingly offered to have a glass of liqueur with him. So she went to fetch a bottle of curacao\nfrom the cupboard, reached down two small glasses, filled one to the brim, poured scarcely anything into\nthe other, and, after having clinked glasses, carried hers to her mouth. As it was almost empty she bent\nback to drink, her head thrown back, her lips pouting, her neck on the strain. She laughed at getting none\nof it, while with the tip of her tongue passing between her small teeth she licked drop by drop the bottom\nof her glass.\nShe sat down again and took up her work, a white cotton stocking she was darning. She worked with her\nhead bent down; she did not speak, nor did Charles. The air coming in under the door blew a little dust\nover the flags; he watched it drift along, and heard nothing but the throbbing in his head and the faint\nclucking of a hen that had laid an egg in the yard. Emma from time to time cooled her cheeks with the\npalms of her hands, and cooled these again on the knobs of the huge fire-dogs.\nShe complained of suffering since the beginning of the season from giddiness; she asked if sea-baths\nwould do her any good; she began talking of her convent, Charles of his school; words came to them.\nThey went up into her bedroom. She showed him her old music-books, the little prizes she had won, and\nthe oak-leaf crowns, left at the bottom of a cupboard. She spoke to him, too, of her mother, of the country,\nand even showed him the bed in the garden where, on the first Friday of every month, she gathered\nflowers to put on her mother's tomb. But the gardener they had never knew anything about it; servants are\nso stupid! She would have dearly liked, if only for the winter, to live in town, although the length of the\nfine days made the country perhaps even more wearisome in the summer. And, according to what she was\nsaying, her voice was clear, sharp, or, on a sudden all languor, drawn out in modulations that ended\nalmost in murmurs as she spoke to herself, now joyous, opening big naive eyes, then with her eyelids half\nclosed, her look full of boredom, her thoughts wandering.\nGoing home at night, Charles went over her words one by one, trying to recall them, to fill out their sense,\nthat he might piece out the life she had lived before he knew her. But he never saw her in his thoughts\nother than he had seen her the first time, or as he had just left her. Then he asked himself what would\nbecome of her--if she would be married, and to whom! Alas! Old Rouault was rich, and she!--so\nbeautiful! But Emma's face always rose before his eyes, and a monotone, like the humming of a top,\nsounded in his ears, \"If you should marry after all! If you should marry!\" At night he could not sleep; his\nthroat was parched; he was athirst. He got up to drink from the water-bottle and opened the window. The\nnight was covered with stars, a warm wind blowing in the distance; the dogs were barking. He turned his\nhead towards the Bertaux.\nThinking that, after all, he should lose nothing, Charles promised himself to ask her in marriage as soon\nas occasion offered, but each time such occasion did offer the fear of not finding the right words sealed\n-11\n\nhis lips.\nOld Rouault would not have been sorry to be rid of his daughter, who was of no use to him in the house.\nIn his heart he excused her, thinking her too clever for farming, a calling under the ban of Heaven, since\none never saw a millionaire in it. Far from having made a fortune by it, the good man was losing every\nyear; for if he was good in bargaining, in which he enjoyed the dodges of the trade, on the other hand,\nagriculture properly so called, and the internal management of the farm, suited him less than most people.\nHe did not willingly take his hands out of his pockets, and did not spare expense in all that concerned\nhimself, liking to eat well, to have good fires, and to sleep well. He liked old cider, underdone legs of\nmutton, glorias[5] well beaten up. He took his meals in the kitchen alone, opposite the fire, on a little\ntable brought to him all ready laid as on the stage.\n[5]A mixture of coffee and spirits.\nWhen, therefore, he perceived that Charles's cheeks grew red if near his daughter, which meant that he\nwould propose for her one of these days, he chewed the cud of the matter beforehand. He certainly\nthought him a little meagre, and not quite the son-in-law he would have liked, but he was said to be well\nbrought-up, economical, very learned, and no doubt would not make too many difficulties about the\ndowry. Now, as old Rouault would soon be forced to sell twenty-two acres of \"his property,\" as he owed\na good deal to the mason, to the harness-maker, and as the shaft of the cider-press wanted renewing, \"If\nhe asks for her,\" he said to himself, \"I'll give her to him.\"\nAt Michaelmas Charles went to spend three days at the Bertaux.\nThe last had passed like the others in procrastinating from hour to hour. Old Rouault was seeing him off;\nthey were walking along the road full of ruts; they were about to part. This was the time. Charles gave\nhimself as far as to the corner of the hedge, and at last, when past it--\n\"Monsieur Rouault,\" he murmured, \"I should like to say something to you.\"\nThey stopped. Charles was silent.\n\"Well, tell me your story. Don't I know all about it?\" said old Rouault, laughing softly.\n\"Monsieur Rouault--Monsieur Rouault,\" stammered Charles.\n\"I ask nothing better\", the farmer went on. \"Although, no doubt, the little one is of my mind, still we must\nask her opinion. So you get off--I'll go back home. If it is \"yes\", you needn't return because of all the\npeople about, and besides it would upset her too much. But so that you mayn't be eating your heart, I'll\nopen wide the outer shutter of the window against the wall; you can see it from the back by leaning over\nthe hedge.\"\nAnd he went off.\nCharles fastened his horse to a tree; he ran into the road and waited. Half an hour passed, then he counted\nnineteen minutes by his watch. Suddenly a noise was heard against the wall; the shutter had been thrown\nback; the hook was still swinging.\nThe next day by nine o'clock he was at the farm. Emma blushed as he entered, and she gave a little forced\nlaugh to keep herself in countenance. Old Rouault embraced his future son-in-law. The discussion of\nmoney matters was put off; moreover, there was plenty of time before them, as the marriage could not\n-12\n\ndecently take place till Charles was out of mourning, that is to say, about the spring of the next year.\nThe winter passed waiting for this. Mademoiselle Rouault was busy with her trousseau. Part of it was\nordered at Rouen, and she made herself chemises and nightcaps after fashion-plates that she borrowed.\nWhen Charles visited the farmer, the preparations for the wedding were talked over; they wondered in\nwhat room they should have dinner; they dreamed of the number of dishes that would be wanted, and\nwhat should be entrees.\nEmma would, on the contrary, have preferred to have a midnight wedding with torches, but old Rouault\ncould not understand such an idea. So there was a wedding at which forty-three persons were present, at\nwhich they remained sixteen hours at table, began again the next day, and to some extent on the days\nfollowing.\nChapter Four\nThe guests arrived early in carriages, in one-horse chaises, two-wheeled cars, old open gigs, waggonettes\nwith leather hoods, and the young people from the nearer villages in carts, in which they stood up in rows,\nholding on to the sides so as not to fall, going at a trot and well shaken up. Some came from a distance of\nthirty miles, from Goderville, from Normanville, and from Cany.\nAll the relatives of both families had been invited, quarrels between friends arranged, acquaintances long\nsince lost sight of written to.\nFrom time to time one heard the crack of a whip behind the hedge; then the gates opened, a chaise\nentered. Galloping up to the foot of the steps, it stopped short and emptied its load. They got down from\nall sides, rubbing knees and stretching arms. The ladies, wearing bonnets, had on dresses in the town\nfashion, gold watch chains, pelerines with the ends tucked into belts, or little coloured fichus fastened\ndown behind with a pin, and that left the back of the neck bare. The lads, dressed like their papas, seemed\nuncomfortable in their new clothes (many that day hand-sewed their first pair of boots), and by their\nsides, speaking never a work, wearing the white dress of their first communion lengthened for the\noccasion were some big girls of fourteen or sixteen, cousins or elder sisters no doubt, rubicund,\nbewildered, their hair greasy with rose pomade, and very much afraid of dirtying their gloves. As there\nwere not enough stable-boys to unharness all the carriages, the gentlemen turned up their sleeves and set\nabout it themselves. According to their different social positions they wore tail-coats, overcoats, shooting\njackets, cutaway-coats; fine tail-coats, redolent of family respectability, that only came out of the\nwardrobe on state occasions; overcoats with long tails flapping in the wind and round capes and pockets\nlike sacks; shooting jackets of coarse cloth, generally worn with a cap with a brass-bound peak; very short\ncutaway-coats with two small buttons in the back, close together like a pair of eyes, and the tails of which\nseemed cut out of one piece by a carpenter's hatchet. Some, too (but these, you may be sure, would sit at\nthe bottom of the table), wore their best blouses--that is to say, with collars turned down to the shoulders,\nthe back gathered into small plaits and the waist fastened very low down with a worked belt.\nAnd the shirts stood out from the chests like cuirasses! Everyone had just had his hair cut; ears stood out\nfrom the heads; they had been close-shaved; a few, even, who had had to get up before daybreak, and not\nbeen able to see to shave, had diagonal gashes under their noses or cuts the size of a three-franc piece\nalong the jaws, which the fresh air en route had enflamed, so that the great white beaming faces were\nmottled here and there with red dabs.\nThe mairie was a mile and a half from the farm, and they went thither on foot, returning in the same way\nafter the ceremony in the church. The procession, first united like one long coloured scarf that undulated\nacross the fields, along the narrow path winding amid the green corn, soon lengthened out, and broke up\ninto different groups that loitered to talk. The fiddler walked in front with his violin, gay with ribbons at\n-13\n\nits pegs. Then came the married pair, the relations, the friends, all following pell-mell; the children stayed\nbehind amusing themselves plucking the bell-flowers from oat-ears, or playing amongst themselves\nunseen. Emma's dress, too long, trailed a little on the ground; from time to time she stopped to pull it up,\nand then delicately, with her gloved hands, she picked off the coarse grass and the thistledowns, while\nCharles, empty handed, waited till she had finished. Old Rouault, with a new silk hat and the cuffs of his\nblack coat covering his hands up to the nails, gave his arm to Madame Bovary senior. As to Monsieur\nBovary senior, who, heartily despising all these folk, had come simply in a frock-coat of military cut with\none row of buttons--he was passing compliments of the bar to a fair young peasant. She bowed, blushed,\nand did not know what to say. The other wedding guests talked of their business or played tricks behind\neach other's backs, egging one another on in advance to be jolly. Those who listened could always catch\nthe squeaking of the fiddler, who went on playing across the fields. When he saw that the rest were far\nbehind he stopped to take breath, slowly rosined his bow, so that the strings should sound more shrilly,\nthen set off again, by turns lowering and raising his neck, the better to mark time for himself. The noise of\nthe instrument drove away the little birds from afar.\nThe table was laid under the cart-shed. On it were four sirloins, six chicken fricassees, stewed veal, three\nlegs of mutton, and in the middle a fine roast suckling pig, flanked by four chitterlings with sorrel. At the\ncorners were decanters of brandy. Sweet bottled-cider frothed round the corks, and all the glasses had\nbeen filled to the brim with wine beforehand. Large dishes of yellow cream, that trembled with the least\nshake of the table, had designed on their smooth surface the initials of the newly wedded pair in nonpareil\narabesques. A confectioner of Yvetot had been intrusted with the tarts and sweets. As he had only just set\nup on the place, he had taken a lot of trouble, and at dessert he himself brought in a set dish that evoked\nloud cries of wonderment. To begin with, at its base there was a square of blue cardboard, representing a\ntemple with porticoes, colonnades, and stucco statuettes all round, and in the niches constellations of gilt\npaper stars; then on the second stage was a dungeon of Savoy cake, surrounded by many fortifications in\ncandied angelica, almonds, raisins, and quarters of oranges; and finally, on the upper platform a green\nfield with rocks set in lakes of jam, nutshell boats, and a small Cupid balancing himself in a chocolate\nswing whose two uprights ended in real roses for balls at the top.\nUntil night they ate. When any of them were too tired of sitting, they went out for a stroll in the yard, or\nfor a game with corks in the granary, and then returned to table. Some towards the finish went to sleep\nand snored. But with the coffee everyone woke up. Then they began songs, showed off tricks, raised\nheavy weights, performed feats with their fingers, then tried lifting carts on their shoulders, made broad\njokes, kissed the women. At night when they left, the horses, stuffed up to the nostrils with oats, could\nhardly be got into the shafts; they kicked, reared, the harness broke, their masters laughed or swore; and\nall night in the light of the moon along country roads there were runaway carts at full gallop plunging into\nthe ditches, jumping over yard after yard of stones, clambering up the hills, with women leaning out from\nthe tilt to catch hold of the reins.\nThose who stayed at the Bertaux spent the night drinking in the kitchen. The children had fallen asleep\nunder the seats.\nThe bride had begged her father to be spared the usual marriage pleasantries. However, a fishmonger, one\nof their cousins (who had even brought a pair of soles for his wedding present), began to squirt water\nfrom his mouth through the keyhole, when old Rouault came up just in time to stop him, and explain to\nhim that the distinguished position of his son-in-law would not allow of such liberties. The cousin all the\nsame did not give in to these reasons readily. In his heart he accused old Rouault of being proud, and he\njoined four or five other guests in a corner, who having, through mere chance, been several times running\nserved with the worst helps of meat, also were of opinion they had been badly used, and were whispering\nabout their host, and with covered hints hoping he would ruin himself.\n-14\n\nMadame Bovary, senior, had not opened her mouth all day. She had been consulted neither as to the dress\nof her daughter-in-law nor as to the arrangement of the feast; she went to bed early. Her husband, instead\nof following her, sent to Saint-Victor for some cigars, and smoked till daybreak, drinking kirsch-punch, a\nmixture unknown to the company. This added greatly to the consideration in which he was held.\nCharles, who was not of a facetious turn, did not shine at the wedding. He answered feebly to the puns,\ndoubles entendres[6], compliments, and chaff that it was felt a duty to let off at him as soon as the soup\nappeared.\n[6]Double meanings.\nThe next day, on the other hand, he seemed another man. It was he who might rather have been taken for\nthe virgin of the evening before, whilst the bride gave no sign that revealed anything. The shrewdest did\nnot know what to make of it, and they looked at her when she passed near them with an unbounded\nconcentration of mind. But Charles concealed nothing. He called her \"my wife\", tutoyed[7] her, asked for\nher of everyone, looked for her everywhere, and often he dragged her into the yards, where he could be\nseen from far between the trees, putting his arm around her waist, and walking half-bending over her,\nruffling the chemisette of her bodice with his head.\n[7]Used the familiar form of address.\nTwo days after the wedding the married pair left. Charles, on account of his patients, could not be away\nlonger. Old Rouault had them driven back in his cart, and himself accompanied them as far as\nVassonville. Here he embraced his daughter for the last time, got down, and went his way. When he had\ngone about a hundred paces he stopped, and as he saw the cart disappearing, its wheels turning in the\ndust, he gave a deep sigh. Then he remembered his wedding, the old times, the first pregnancy of his\nwife; he, too, had been very happy the day when he had taken her from her father to his home, and had\ncarried her off on a pillion, trotting through the snow, for it was near Christmas-time, and the country was\nall white. She held him by one arm, her basket hanging from the other; the wind blew the long lace of her\nCauchois headdress so that it sometimes flapped across his mouth, and when he turned his head he saw\nnear him, on his shoulder, her little rosy face, smiling silently under the gold bands of her cap. To warm\nher hands she put them from time to time in his breast. How long ago it all was! Their son would have\nbeen thirty by now. Then he looked back and saw nothing on the road. He felt dreary as an empty house;\nand tender memories mingling with the sad thoughts in his brain, addled by the fumes of the feast, he felt\ninclined for a moment to take a turn towards the church. As he was afraid, however, that this sight would\nmake him yet more sad, he went right away home.\nMonsieur and Madame Charles arrived at Tostes about six o'clock.\nThe neighbors came to the windows to see their doctor's new wife.\nThe old servant presented herself, curtsied to her, apologised for not having dinner ready, and suggested\nthat madame, in the meantime, should look over her house.\nChapter Five\nThe brick front was just in a line with the street, or rather the road. Behind the door hung a cloak with a\nsmall collar, a bridle, and a black leather cap, and on the floor, in a corner, were a pair of leggings, still\ncovered with dry mud. On the right was the one apartment, that was both dining and sitting room. A\ncanary yellow paper, relieved at the top by a garland of pale flowers, was puckered everywhere over the\nbadly stretched canvas; white calico curtains with a red border hung crossways at the length of the\nwindow; and on the narrow mantelpiece a clock with a head of Hippocrates shone resplendent between\n-15\n\ntwo plate candlesticks under oval shades. On the other side of the passage was Charles's consulting room,\na little room about six paces wide, with a table, three chairs, and an office chair. Volumes of the\n\"Dictionary of Medical Science,\" uncut, but the binding rather the worse for the successive sales through\nwhich they had gone, occupied almost along the six shelves of a deal bookcase.\nThe smell of melted butter penetrated through the walls when he saw patients, just as in the kitchen one\ncould hear the people coughing in the consulting room and recounting their histories.\nThen, opening on the yard, where the stable was, came a large dilapidated room with a stove, now used as\na wood-house, cellar, and pantry, full of old rubbish, of empty casks, agricultural implements past service,\nand a mass of dusty things whose use it was impossible to guess.\nThe garden, longer than wide, ran between two mud walls with espaliered apricots, to a hawthorn hedge\nthat separated it from the field. In the middle was a slate sundial on a brick pedestal; four flower beds\nwith eglantines surrounded symmetrically the more useful kitchen garden bed. Right at the bottom, under\nthe spruce bushes, was a cure in plaster reading his breviary.\nEmma went upstairs. The first room was not furnished, but in the second, which was their bedroom, was a\nmahogany bedstead in an alcove with red drapery. A shell box adorned the chest of drawers, and on the\nsecretary near the window a bouquet of orange blossoms tied with white satin ribbons stood in a bottle. It\nwas a bride's bouquet; it was the other one's. She looked at it. Charles noticed it; he took it and carried it\nup to the attic, while Emma seated in an arm-chair (they were putting her things down around her)\nthought of her bridal flowers packed up in a bandbox, and wondered, dreaming, what would be done with\nthem if she were to die.\nDuring the first days she occupied herself in thinking about changes in the house. She took the shades off\nthe candlesticks, had new wallpaper put up, the staircase repainted, and seats made in the garden round\nthe sundial; she even inquired how she could get a basin with a jet fountain and fishes. Finally her\nhusband, knowing that she liked to drive out, picked up a second-hand dogcart, which, with new lamps\nand splashboard in striped leather, looked almost like a tilbury.\nHe was happy then, and without a care in the world. A meal together, a walk in the evening on the\nhighroad, a gesture of her hands over her hair, the sight of her straw hat hanging from the\nwindow-fastener, and many another thing in which Charles had never dreamed of pleasure, now made up\nthe endless round of his happiness. In bed, in the morning, by her side, on the pillow, he watched the\nsunlight sinking into the down on her fair cheek, half hidden by the lappets of her night-cap. Seen thus\nclosely, her eyes looked to him enlarged, especially when, on waking up, she opened and shut them\nrapidly many times. Black in the shade, dark blue in broad daylight, they had, as it were, depths of\ndifferent colours, that, darker in the centre, grew paler towards the surface of the eye. His own eyes lost\nthemselves in these depths; he saw himself in miniature down to the shoulders, with his handkerchief\nround his head and the top of his shirt open. He rose. She came to the window to see him off, and stayed\nleaning on the sill between two pots of geranium, clad in her dressing gown hanging loosely about her.\nCharles, in the street buckled his spurs, his foot on the mounting stone, while she talked to him from\nabove, picking with her mouth some scrap of flower or leaf that she blew out at him. Then this, eddying,\nfloating, described semicircles in the air like a bird, and was caught before it reached the ground in the\nill-groomed mane of the old white mare standing motionless at the door. Charles from horseback threw\nher a kiss; she answered with a nod; she shut the window, and he set off. And then along the highroad,\nspreading out its long ribbon of dust, along the deep lanes that the trees bent over as in arbours, along\npaths where the corn reached to the knees, with the sun on his back and the morning air in his nostrils, his\nheart full of the joys of the past night, his mind at rest, his flesh at ease, he went on, re-chewing his\nhappiness, like those who after dinner taste again the truffles which they are digesting.\n-16\n\nUntil now what good had he had of his life? His time at school, when he remained shut up within the high\nwalls, alone, in the midst of companions richer than he or cleverer at their work, who laughed at his\naccent, who jeered at his clothes, and whose mothers came to the school with cakes in their muffs? Later\non, when he studied medicine, and never had his purse full enough to treat some little work-girl who\nwould have become his mistress? Afterwards, he had lived fourteen months with the widow, whose feet\nin bed were cold as icicles. But now he had for life this beautiful woman whom he adored. For him the\nuniverse did not extend beyond the circumference of her petticoat, and he reproached himself with not\nloving her. He wanted to see her again; he turned back quickly, ran up the stairs with a beating heart.\nEmma, in her room, was dressing; he came up on tiptoe, kissed her back; she gave a cry.\nHe could not keep from constantly touching her comb, her ring, her fichu; sometimes he gave her great\nsounding kisses with all his mouth on her cheeks, or else little kisses in a row all along her bare arm from\nthe tip of her fingers up to her shoulder, and she put him away half-smiling, half-vexed, as you do a child\nwho hangs about you.\nBefore marriage she thought herself in love; but the happiness that should have followed this love not\nhaving come, she must, she thought, have been mistaken. And Emma tried to find out what one meant\nexactly in life by the words felicity, passion, rapture, that had seemed to her so beautiful in books.\nChapter Six\nShe had read \"Paul and Virginia,\" and she had dreamed of the little bamboo-house, the nigger Domingo,\nthe dog Fiddle, but above all of the sweet friendship of some dear little brother, who seeks red fruit for\nyou on trees taller than steeples, or who runs barefoot over the sand, bringing you a bird's nest.\nWhen she was thirteen, her father himself took her to town to place her in the convent. They stopped at an\ninn in the St. Gervais quarter, where, at their supper, they used painted plates that set forth the story of\nMademoiselle de la Valliere. The explanatory legends, chipped here and there by the scratching of knives,\nall glorified religion, the tendernesses of the heart, and the pomps of court.\nFar from being bored at first at the convent, she took pleasure in the society of the good sisters, who, to\namuse her, took her to the chapel, which one entered from the refectory by a long corridor. She played\nvery little during recreation hours, knew her catechism well, and it was she who always answered\nMonsieur le Vicaire's difficult questions. Living thus, without every leaving the warm atmosphere of the\nclassrooms, and amid these pale-faced women wearing rosaries with brass crosses, she was softly lulled\nby the mystic languor exhaled in the perfumes of the altar, the freshness of the holy water, and the lights\nof the tapers. Instead of attending to mass, she looked at the pious vignettes with their azure borders in her\nbook, and she loved the sick lamb, the sacred heart pierced with sharp arrows, or the poor Jesus sinking\nbeneath the cross he carries. She tried, by way of mortification, to eat nothing a whole day. She puzzled\nher head to find some vow to fulfil.\nWhen she went to confession, she invented little sins in order that she might stay there longer, kneeling in\nthe shadow, her hands joined, her face against the grating beneath the whispering of the priest. The\ncomparisons of betrothed, husband, celestial lover, and eternal marriage, that recur in sermons, stirred\nwithin her soul depths of unexpected sweetness.\nIn the evening, before prayers, there was some religious reading in the study. On week-nights it was some\nabstract of sacred history or the Lectures of the Abbe Frayssinous, and on Sundays passages from the\n\"Genie du Christianisme,\" as a recreation. How she listened at first to the sonorous lamentations of its\nromantic melancholies reechoing through the world and eternity! If her childhood had been spent in the\nshop-parlour of some business quarter, she might perhaps have opened her heart to those lyrical invasions\nof Nature, which usually come to us only through translation in books. But she knew the country too well;\n-17\n\nshe knew the lowing of cattle, the milking, the ploughs.\nAccustomed to calm aspects of life, she turned, on the contrary, to those of excitement. She loved the sea\nonly for the sake of its storms, and the green fields only when broken up by ruins.\nShe wanted to get some personal profit out of things, and she rejected as useless all that did not contribute\nto the immediate desires of her heart, being of a temperament more sentimental than artistic, looking for\nemotions, not landscapes.\nAt the convent there was an old maid who came for a week each month to mend the linen. Patronized by\nthe clergy, because she belonged to an ancient family of noblemen ruined by the Revolution, she dined in\nthe refectory at the table of the good sisters, and after the meal had a bit of chat with them before going\nback to her work. The girls often slipped out from the study to go and see her. She knew by heart the love\nsongs of the last century, and sang them in a low voice as she stitched away.\nShe told stories, gave them news, went errands in the town, and on the sly lent the big girls some novel,\nthat she always carried in the pockets of her apron, and of which the good lady herself swallowed long\nchapters in the intervals of her work. They were all love, lovers, sweethearts, persecuted ladies fainting in\nlonely pavilions, postilions killed at every stage, horses ridden to death on every page, sombre forests,\nheartaches, vows, sobs, tears and kisses, little skiffs by moonlight, nightingales in shady groves,\n\"gentlemen\" brave as lions, gentle as lambs, virtuous as no one ever was, always well dressed, and\nweeping like fountains. For six months, then, Emma, at fifteen years of age, made her hands dirty with\nbooks from old lending libraries.\nThrough Walter Scott, later on, she fell in love with historical events, dreamed of old chests, guard-rooms\nand minstrels. She would have liked to live in some old manor-house, like those long-waisted chatelaines\nwho, in the shade of pointed arches, spent their days leaning on the stone, chin in hand, watching a\ncavalier with white plume galloping on his black horse from the distant fields. At this time she had a cult\nfor Mary Stuart and enthusiastic veneration for illustrious or unhappy women. Joan of Arc, Heloise,\nAgnes Sorel, the beautiful Ferroniere, and Clemence Isaure stood out to her like comets in the dark\nimmensity of heaven, where also were seen, lost in shadow, and all unconnected, St. Louis with his oak,\nthe dying Bayard, some cruelties of Louis XI, a little of St. Bartholomew's Day, the plume of the\nBearnais, and always the remembrance of the plates painted in honour of Louis XIV.\nIn the music class, in the ballads she sang, there was nothing but little angels with golden wings,\nmadonnas, lagunes, gondoliers;-mild compositions that allowed her to catch a glimpse athwart the\nobscurity of style and the weakness of the music of the attractive phantasmagoria of sentimental realities.\nSome of her companions brought \"keepsakes\" given them as new year's gifts to the convent. These had to\nbe hidden; it was quite an undertaking; they were read in the dormitory. Delicately handling the beautiful\nsatin bindings, Emma looked with dazzled eyes at the names of the unknown authors, who had signed\ntheir verses for the most part as counts or viscounts.\nShe trembled as she blew back the tissue paper over the engraving and saw it folded in two and fall gently\nagainst the page. Here behind the balustrade of a balcony was a young man in a short cloak, holding in his\narms a young girl in a white dress wearing an alms-bag at her belt; or there were nameless portraits of\nEnglish ladies with fair curls, who looked at you from under their round straw hats with their large clear\neyes. Some there were lounging in their carriages, gliding through parks, a greyhound bounding along in\nfront of the equipage driven at a trot by two midget postilions in white breeches. Others, dreaming on\nsofas with an open letter, gazed at the moon through a slightly open window half draped by a black\ncurtain. The naive ones, a tear on their cheeks, were kissing doves through the bars of a Gothic cage, or,\nsmiling, their heads on one side, were plucking the leaves of a marguerite with their taper fingers, that\n-18\n\ncurved at the tips like peaked shoes. And you, too, were there, Sultans with long pipes reclining beneath\narbours in the arms of Bayaderes; Djiaours, Turkish sabres, Greek caps; and you especially, pale\nlandscapes of dithyrambic lands, that often show us at once palm trees and firs, tigers on the right, a lion\nto the left, Tartar minarets on the horizon; the whole framed by a very neat virgin forest, and with a great\nperpendicular sunbeam trembling in the water, where, standing out in relief like white excoriations on a\nsteel-grey ground, swans are swimming about.\nAnd the shade of the argand lamp fastened to the wall above Emma's head lighted up all these pictures of\nthe world, that passed before her one by one in the silence of the dormitory, and to the distant noise of\nsome belated carriage rolling over the Boulevards.\nWhen her mother died she cried much the first few days. She had a funeral picture made with the hair of\nthe deceased, and, in a letter sent to the Bertaux full of sad reflections on life, she asked to be buried later\non in the same grave. The goodman thought she must be ill, and came to see her. Emma was secretly\npleased that she had reached at a first attempt the rare ideal of pale lives, never attained by mediocre\nhearts. She let herself glide along with Lamartine meanderings, listened to harps on lakes, to all the songs\nof dying swans, to the falling of the leaves, the pure virgins ascending to heaven, and the voice of the\nEternal discoursing down the valleys. She wearied of it, would not confess it, continued from habit, and at\nlast was surprised to feel herself soothed, and with no more sadness at heart than wrinkles on her brow.\nThe good nuns, who had been so sure of her vocation, perceived with great astonishment that\nMademoiselle Rouault seemed to be slipping from them. They had indeed been so lavish to her of\nprayers, retreats, novenas, and sermons, they had so often preached the respect due to saints and martyrs,\nand given so much good advice as to the modesty of the body and the salvation of her soul, that she did as\ntightly reined horses; she pulled up short and the bit slipped from her teeth. This nature, positive in the\nmidst of its enthusiasms, that had loved the church for the sake of the flowers, and music for the words of\nthe songs, and literature for its passional stimulus, rebelled against the mysteries of faith as it grew\nirritated by discipline, a thing antipathetic to her constitution. When her father took her from school, no\none was sorry to see her go. The Lady Superior even thought that she had latterly been somewhat\nirreverent to the community.\nEmma, at home once more, first took pleasure in looking after the servants, then grew disgusted with the\ncountry and missed her convent. When Charles came to the Bertaux for the first time, she thought herself\nquite disillusioned, with nothing more to learn, and nothing more to feel.\nBut the uneasiness of her new position, or perhaps the disturbance caused by the presence of this man,\nhad sufficed to make her believe that she at last felt that wondrous passion which, till then, like a great\nbird with rose-coloured wings, hung in the splendour of the skies of poesy; and now she could not think\nthat the calm in which she lived was the happiness she had dreamed.\nChapter Seven\nShe thought, sometimes, that, after all, this was the happiest time of her life--the honeymoon, as people\ncalled it. To taste the full sweetness of it, it would have been necessary doubtless to fly to those lands\nwith sonorous names where the days after marriage are full of laziness most suave. In post chaises behind\nblue silken curtains to ride slowly up steep road, listening to the song of the postilion re-echoed by the\nmountains, along with the bells of goats and the muffled sound of a waterfall; at sunset on the shores of\ngulfs to breathe in the perfume of lemon trees; then in the evening on the villa-terraces above, hand in\nhand to look at the stars, making plans for the future. It seemed to her that certain places on earth must\nbring happiness, as a plant peculiar to the soil, and that cannot thrive elsewhere. Why could not she lean\nover balconies in Swiss chalets, or enshrine her melancholy in a Scotch cottage, with a husband dressed in\na black velvet coat with long tails, and thin shoes, a pointed hat and frills? Perhaps she would have liked\n-19\n\nto confide all these things to someone. But how tell an undefinable uneasiness, variable as the clouds,\nunstable as the winds? Words failed her--the opportunity, the courage.\nIf Charles had but wished it, if he had guessed it, if his look had but once met her thought, it seemed to\nher that a sudden plenty would have gone out from her heart, as the fruit falls from a tree when shaken by\na hand. But as the intimacy of their life became deeper, the greater became the gulf that separated her\nfrom him.\nCharles's conversation was commonplace as a street pavement, and everyone's ideas trooped through it in\ntheir everyday garb, without exciting emotion, laughter, or thought. He had never had the curiosity, he\nsaid, while he lived at Rouen, to go to the theatre to see the actors from Paris. He could neither swim, nor\nfence, nor shoot, and one day he could not explain some term of horsemanship to her that she had come\nacross in a novel.\nA man, on the contrary, should he not know everything, excel in manifold activities, initiate you into the\nenergies of passion, the refinements of life, all mysteries? But this one taught nothing, knew nothing,\nwished nothing. He thought her happy; and she resented this easy calm, this serene heaviness, the very\nhappiness she gave him.\nSometimes she would draw; and it was great amusement to Charles to stand there bolt upright and watch\nher bend over her cardboard, with eyes half-closed the better to see her work, or rolling, between her\nfingers, little bread-pellets. As to the piano, the more quickly her fingers glided over it the more he\nwondered. She struck the notes with aplomb, and ran from top to bottom of the keyboard without a break.\nThus shaken up, the old instrument, whose strings buzzed, could be heard at the other end of the village\nwhen the window was open, and often the bailiff's clerk, passing along the highroad bare-headed and in\nlist slippers, stopped to listen, his sheet of paper in his hand.\nEmma, on the other hand, knew how to look after her house. She sent the patients' accounts in\nwell-phrased letters that had no suggestion of a bill. When they had a neighbour to dinner on Sundays,\nshe managed to have some tasty dish--piled up pyramids of greengages on vine leaves, served up\npreserves turned out into plates--and even spoke of buying finger-glasses for dessert. From all this much\nconsideration was extended to Bovary.\nCharles finished by rising in his own esteem for possessing such a wife. He showed with pride in the\nsitting room two small pencil sketched by her that he had had framed in very large frames, and hung up\nagainst the wallpaper by long green cords. People returning from mass saw him at his door in his\nwool-work slippers.\nHe came home late--at ten o'clock, at midnight sometimes. Then he asked for something to eat, and as\nthe servant had gone to bed, Emma waited on him. He took off his coat to dine more at his ease. He told\nher, one after the other, the people he had met, the villages where he had been, the prescriptions ha had\nwritten, and, well pleased with himself, he finished the remainder of the boiled beef and onions, picked\npieces off the cheese, munched an apple, emptied his water-bottle, and then went to bed, and lay on his\nback and snored.\nAs he had been for a time accustomed to wear nightcaps, his handkerchief would not keep down over his\nears, so that his hair in the morning was all tumbled pell-mell about his face and whitened with the\nfeathers of the pillow, whose strings came untied during the night. He always wore thick boots that had\ntwo long creases over the instep running obliquely towards the ankle, while the rest of the upper\ncontinued in a straight line as if stretched on a wooden foot. He said that \"was quite good enough for the\ncountry.\"\n-20\n\nHis mother approved of his economy, for she came to see him as formerly when there had been some\nviolent row at her place; and yet Madame Bovary senior seemed prejudiced against her daughter-in-law.\nShe thought \"her ways too fine for their position\"; the wood, the sugar, and the candles disappeared as \"at\na grand establishment,\" and the amount of firing in the kitchen would have been enough for twenty-five\ncourses. She put her linen in order for her in the presses, and taught her to keep an eye on the butcher\nwhen he brought the meat. Emma put up with these lessons. Madame Bovary was lavish of them; and the\nwords \"daughter\" and \"mother\" were exchanged all day long, accompanied by little quiverings of the lips,\neach one uttering gentle words in a voice trembling with anger.\nIn Madame Dubuc's time the old woman felt that she was still the favorite; but now the love of Charles\nfor Emma seemed to her a desertion from her tenderness, an encroachment upon what was hers, and she\nwatched her son's happiness in sad silence, as a ruined man looks through the windows at people dining\nin his old house. She recalled to him as remembrances her troubles and her sacrifices, and, comparing\nthese with Emma's negligence, came to the conclusion that it was not reasonable to adore her so\nexclusively.\nCharles knew not what to answer: he respected his mother, and he loved his wife infinitely; he considered\nthe judgment of the one infallible, and yet he thought the conduct of the other irreproachable. When\nMadam Bovary had gone, he tried timidly and in the same terms to hazard one or two of the more\nanodyne observations he had heard from his mamma. Emma proved to him with a word that he was\nmistaken, and sent him off to his patients.\nAnd yet, in accord with theories she believed right, she wanted to make herself in love with him. By\nmoonlight in the garden she recited all the passionate rhymes she knew by heart, and, sighing, sang to him\nmany melancholy adagios; but she found herself as calm after as before, and Charles seemed no more\namorous and no more moved.\nWhen she had thus for a while struck the flint on her heart without getting a spark, incapable, moreover,\nof understanding what she did not experience as of believing anything that did not present itself in\nconventional forms, she persuaded herself without difficulty that Charles's passion was nothing very\nexorbitant. His outbursts became regular; he embraced her at certain fixed times. It was one habit among\nother habits, and, like a dessert, looked forward to after the monotony of dinner.\nA gamekeeper, cured by the doctor of inflammation of the lungs, had given madame a little Italian\ngreyhound; she took her out walking, for she went out sometimes in order to be alone for a moment, and\nnot to see before her eyes the eternal garden and the dusty road. She went as far as the beeches of\nBanneville, near the deserted pavilion which forms an angle of the wall on the side of the country. Amidst\nthe vegetation of the ditch there are long reeds with leaves that cut you.\nShe began by looking round her to see if nothing had changed since last she had been there. She found\nagain in the same places the foxgloves and wallflowers, the beds of nettles growing round the big stones,\nand the patches of lichen along the three windows, whose shutters, always closed, were rotting away on\ntheir rusty iron bars. Her thoughts, aimless at first, wandered at random, like her greyhound, who ran\nround and round in the fields, yelping after the yellow butterflies, chasing the shrew-mice, or nibbling the\npoppies on the edge of a cornfield.\nThen gradually her ideas took definite shape, and, sitting on the grass that she dug up with little prods of\nher sunshade, Emma repeated to herself, \"Good heavens! Why did I marry?\"\nShe asked herself if by some other chance combination it would have not been possible to meet another\nman; and she tried to imagine what would have been these unrealised events, this different life, this\n-21\n\nunknown husband. All, surely, could not be like this one. He might have been handsome, witty,\ndistinguished, attractive, such as, no doubt, her old companions of the convent had married. What were\nthey doing now? In town, with the noise of the streets, the buzz of the theatres and the lights of the\nballroom, they were living lives where the heart expands, the senses bourgeon out. But she--her life was\ncold as a garret whose dormer window looks on the north, and ennui, the silent spider, was weaving its\nweb in the darkness in every corner of her heart.\nShe recalled the prize days, when she mounted the platform to receive her little crowns, with her hair in\nlong plaits. In her white frock and open prunella shoes she had a pretty way, and when she went back to\nher seat, the gentlemen bent over her to congratulate her; the courtyard was full of carriages; farewells\nwere called to her through their windows; the music master with his violin case bowed in passing by.\nHow far all of this! How far away! She called Djali, took her between her knees, and smoothed the long\ndelicate head, saying, \"Come, kiss mistress; you have no troubles.\"\nThen noting the melancholy face of the graceful animal, who yawned slowly, she softened, and\ncomparing her to herself, spoke to her aloud as to somebody in trouble whom one is consoling.\nOccasionally there came gusts of winds, breezes from the sea rolling in one sweep over the whole plateau\nof the Caux country, which brought even to these fields a salt freshness. The rushes, close to the ground,\nwhistled; the branches trembled in a swift rustling, while their summits, ceaselessly swaying, kept up a\ndeep murmur. Emma drew her shawl round her shoulders and rose.\nIn the avenue a green light dimmed by the leaves lit up the short moss that crackled softly beneath her\nfeet. The sun was setting; the sky showed red between the branches, and the trunks of the trees, uniform,\nand planted in a straight line, seemed a brown colonnade standing out against a background of gold. A\nfear took hold of her; she called Djali, and hurriedly returned to Tostes by the high road, threw herself\ninto an armchair, and for the rest of the evening did not speak.\nBut towards the end of September something extraordinary fell upon her life; she was invited by the\nMarquis d'Andervilliers to Vaubyessard.\nSecretary of State under the Restoration, the Marquis, anxious to re-enter political life, set about\npreparing for his candidature to the Chamber of Deputies long beforehand. In the winter he distributed a\ngreat deal of wood, and in the Conseil General always enthusiastically demanded new roads for his\narrondissement. During the dog-days he had suffered from an abscess, which Charles had cured as if by\nmiracle by giving a timely little touch with the lancet. The steward sent to Tostes to pay for the operation\nreported in the evening that he had seen some superb cherries in the doctor's little garden. Now cherry\ntrees did not thrive at Vaubyessard; the Marquis asked Bovary for some slips; made it his business to\nthank his personally; saw Emma; thought she had a pretty figure, and that she did not bow like a peasant;\nso that he did not think he was going beyond the bounds of condescension, nor, on the other hand,\nmaking a mistake, in inviting the young couple.\nOn Wednesday at three o'clock, Monsieur and Madame Bovary, seated in their dog-cart, set out for\nVaubyessard, with a great trunk strapped on behind and a bonnet-box in front of the apron. Besides these\nCharles held a bandbox between his knees.\nThey arrived at nightfall, just as the lamps in the park were being lit to show the way for the carriages.\nChapter Eight\nThe chateau, a modern building in Italian style, with two projecting wings and three flights of steps, lay at\nthe foot of an immense green-sward, on which some cows were grazing among groups of large trees set\n-22\n\nout at regular intervals, while large beds of arbutus, rhododendron, syringas, and guelder roses bulged out\ntheir irregular clusters of green along the curve of the gravel path. A river flowed under a bridge; through\nthe mist one could distinguish buildings with thatched roofs scattered over the field bordered by two\ngently sloping, well timbered hillocks, and in the background amid the trees rose in two parallel lines the\ncoach houses and stables, all that was left of the ruined old chateau.\nCharles's dog-cart pulled up before the middle flight of steps; servants appeared; the Marquis came\nforward, and, offering his arm to the doctor's wife, conducted her to the vestibule.\nIt was paved with marble slabs, was very lofty, and the sound of footsteps and that of voices re-echoed\nthrough it as in a church.\nOpposite rose a straight staircase, and on the left a gallery overlooking the garden led to the billiard room,\nthrough whose door one could hear the click of the ivory balls. As she crossed it to go to the drawing\nroom, Emma saw standing round the table men with grave faces, their chins resting on high cravats. They\nall wore orders, and smiled silently as they made their strokes.\nOn the dark wainscoting of the walls large gold frames bore at the bottom names written in black letters.\nShe read: \"Jean-Antoine d'Andervilliers d'Yvervonbille, Count de la Vaubyessard and Baron de la\nFresnay, killed at the battle of Coutras on the 20th of October, 1857.\" And on another:\n\"Jean-Antoine-Henry-Guy d'Andervilliers de la Vaubyessard, Admiral of France and Chevalier of the\nOrder of St. Michael, wounded at the battle of the Hougue-Saint-Vaast on the 29th of May, 1692; died at\nVaubyessard on the 23rd of January 1693.\" One could hardly make out those that followed, for the light\nof the lamps lowered over the green cloth threw a dim shadow round the room. Burnishing the horizontal\npictures, it broke up against these in delicate lines where there were cracks in the varnish, and from all\nthese great black squares framed in with gold stood out here and there some lighter portion of the\npainting--a pale brow, two eyes that looked at you, perukes flowing over and powdering red-coated\nshoulders, or the buckle of a garter above a well-rounded calf.\nThe Marquis opened the drawing room door; one of the ladies (the Marchioness herself) came to meet\nEmma. She made her sit down by her on an ottoman, and began talking to her as amicably as if she had\nknown her a long time. She was a woman of about forty, with fine shoulders, a hook nose, a drawling\nvoice, and on this evening she wore over her brown hair a simple guipure fichu that fell in a point at the\nback. A fair young woman sat in a high-backed chair in a corner; and gentlemen with flowers in their\nbuttonholes were talking to ladies round the fire.\nAt seven dinner was served. The men, who were in the majority, sat down at the first table in the\nvestibule; the ladies at the second in the dining room with the Marquis and Marchioness.\nEmma, on entering, felt herself wrapped round by the warm air, a blending of the perfume of flowers and\nof the fine linen, of the fumes of the viands, and the odour of the truffles. The silver dish covers reflected\nthe lighted wax candles in the candelabra, the cut crystal covered with light steam reflected from one to\nthe other pale rays; bouquets were placed in a row the whole length of the table; and in the large-bordered\nplates each napkin, arranged after the fashion of a bishop's mitre, held between its two gaping folds a\nsmall oval shaped roll. The red claws of lobsters hung over the dishes; rich fruit in open baskets was piled\nup on moss; there were quails in their plumage; smoke was rising; and in silk stockings, knee-breeches,\nwhite cravat, and frilled shirt, the steward, grave as a judge, offering ready carved dishes between the\nshoulders of the guests, with a touch of the spoon gave you the piece chosen. On the large stove of\nporcelain inlaid with copper baguettes the statue of a woman, draped to the chin, gazed motionless on the\nroom full of life.\n-23\n\nMadame Bovary noticed that many ladies had not put their gloves in their glasses.\nBut at the upper end of the table, alone amongst all these women, bent over his full plate, and his napkin\ntied round his neck like a child, an old man sat eating, letting drops of gravy drip from his mouth. His\neyes were bloodshot, and he wore a little queue tied with black ribbon. He was the Marquis's\nfather-in-law, the old Duke de Laverdiere, once on a time favourite of the Count d'Artois, in the days of\nthe Vaudreuil hunting-parties at the Marquis de Conflans', and had been, it was said, the lover of Queen\nMarie Antoinette, between Monsieur de Coigny and Monsieur de Lauzun. He had lived a life of noisy\ndebauch, full of duels, bets, elopements; he had squandered his fortune and frightened all his family. A\nservant behind his chair named aloud to him in his ear the dishes that he pointed to stammering, and\nconstantly Emma's eyes turned involuntarily to this old man with hanging lips, as to something\nextraordinary. He had lived at court and slept in the bed of queens! Iced champagne was poured out.\nEmma shivered all over as she felt it cold in her mouth. She had never seen pomegranates nor tasted\npineapples. The powdered sugar even seemed to her whiter and finer than elsewhere.\nThe ladies afterwards went to their rooms to prepare for the ball.\nEmma made her toilet with the fastidious care of an actress on her debut. She did her hair according to the\ndirections of the hairdresser, and put on the barege dress spread out upon the bed.\nCharles's trousers were tight across the belly.\n\"My trouser-straps will be rather awkward for dancing,\" he said.\n\"Dancing?\" repeated Emma.\n\"Yes!\"\n\"Why, you must be mad! They would make fun of you; keep your place. Besides, it is more becoming for\na doctor,\" she added.\nCharles was silent. He walked up and down waiting for Emma to finish dressing.\nHe saw her from behind in the glass between two lights. Her black eyes seemed blacker than ever. Her\nhair, undulating towards the ears, shone with a blue lustre; a rose in her chignon trembled on its mobile\nstalk, with artificial dewdrops on the tip of the leaves. She wore a gown of pale saffron trimmed with\nthree bouquets of pompon roses mixed with green.\nCharles came and kissed her on her shoulder.\n\"Let me alone!\" she said; \"you are tumbling me.\"\nOne could hear the flourish of the violin and the notes of a horn. She went downstairs restraining herself\nfrom running.\nDancing had begun. Guests were arriving. There was some crushing.\nShe sat down on a form near the door.\nThe quadrille over, the floor was occupied by groups of men standing up and talking and servants in\nlivery bearing large trays. Along the line of seated women painted fans were fluttering, bouquets half hid\n-24\n\nsmiling faces, and gold stoppered scent-bottles were turned in partly-closed hands, whose white gloves\noutlined the nails and tightened on the flesh at the wrists. Lace trimmings, diamond brooches, medallion\nbracelets trembled on bodices, gleamed on breasts, clinked on bare arms.\nThe hair, well-smoothed over the temples and knotted at the nape, bore crowns, or bunches, or sprays of\nmytosotis, jasmine, pomegranate blossoms, ears of corn, and corn-flowers. Calmly seated in their places,\nmothers with forbidding countenances were wearing red turbans.\nEmma's heart beat rather faster when, her partner holding her by the tips of the fingers, she took her place\nin a line with the dancers, and waited for the first note to start. But her emotion soon vanished, and,\nswaying to the rhythm of the orchestra, she glided forward with slight movements of the neck. A smile\nrose to her lips at certain delicate phrases of the violin, that sometimes played alone while the other\ninstruments were silent; one could hear the clear clink of the louis d'or that were being thrown down upon\nthe card tables in the next room; then all struck again, the cornet-a-piston uttered its sonorous note, feet\nmarked time, skirts swelled and rustled, hands touched and parted; the same eyes falling before you met\nyours again.\nA few men (some fifteen or so), of twenty-five to forty, scattered here and there among the dancers or\ntalking at the doorways, distinguished themselves from the crowd by a certain air of breeding, whatever\ntheir differences in age, dress, or face.\nTheir clothes, better made, seemed of finer cloth, and their hair, brought forward in curls towards the\ntemples, glossy with more delicate pomades. They had the complexion of wealth--that clear complexion\nthat is heightened by the pallor of porcelain, the shimmer of satin, the veneer of old furniture, and that an\nordered regimen of exquisite nurture maintains at its best. Their necks moved easily in their low cravats,\ntheir long whiskers fell over their turned-down collars, they wiped their lips upon handkerchiefs with\nembroidered initials that gave forth a subtle perfume. Those who were beginning to grow old had an air of\nyouth, while there was something mature in the faces of the young. In their unconcerned looks was the\ncalm of passions daily satiated, and through all their gentleness of manner pierced that peculiar brutality,\nthe result of a command of half-easy things, in which force is exercised and vanity amused--the\nmanagement of thoroughbred horses and the society of loose women.\nA few steps from Emma a gentleman in a blue coat was talking of Italy with a pale young woman wearing\na parure of pearls.\nThey were praising the breadth of the columns of St. Peter's, Tivoly, Vesuvius, Castellamare, and\nCassines, the roses of Genoa, the Coliseum by moonlight. With her other ear Emma was listening to a\nconversation full of words she did not understand. A circle gathered round a very young man who the\nweek before had beaten \"Miss Arabella\" and \"Romolus,\" and won two thousand louis jumping a ditch in\nEngland. One complained that his racehorses were growing fat; another of the printers' errors that had\ndisfigured the name of his horse.\nThe atmosphere of the ball was heavy; the lamps were growing dim.\nGuests were flocking to the billiard room. A servant got upon a chair and broke the window-panes. At the\ncrash of the glass Madame Bovary turned her head and saw in the garden the faces of peasants pressed\nagainst the window looking in at them. Then the memory of the Bertaux came back to her. She saw the\nfarm again, the muddy pond, her father in a blouse under the apple trees, and she saw herself again as\nformerly, skimming with her finger the cream off the milk-pans in the dairy. But in the refulgence of the\npresent hour her past life, so distinct until then, faded away completely, and she almost doubted having\nlived it. She was there; beyond the ball was only shadow overspreading all the rest. She was just eating a\n-25\n\nmaraschino ice that she held with her left hand in a silver-gilt cup, her eyes half-closed, and the spoon\nbetween her teeth.\nA lady near her dropped her fan. A gentlemen was passing.\n\"Would you be so good,\" said the lady, \"as to pick up my fan that has fallen behind the sofa?\"\nThe gentleman bowed, and as he moved to stretch out his arm, Emma saw the hand of a young woman\nthrow something white, folded in a triangle, into his hat. The gentleman, picking up the fan, offered it to\nthe lady respectfully; she thanked him with an inclination of the head, and began smelling her bouquet.\nAfter supper, where were plenty of Spanish and Rhine wines, soups a la bisque and au lait d'amandes[8],\npuddings a la Trafalgar, and all sorts of cold meats with jellies that trembled in the dishes, the carriages\none after the other began to drive off. Raising the corners of the muslin curtain, one could see the light of\ntheir lanterns glimmering through the darkness. The seats began to empty, some card-players were still\nleft; the musicians were cooling the tips of their fingers on their tongues. Charles was half asleep, his back\npropped against a door.\n[8]With almond milk\nAt three o'clock the cotillion began. Emma did not know how to waltz. Everyone was waltzing,\nMademoiselle d'Andervilliers herself and the Marquis; only the guests staying at the castle were still\nthere, about a dozen persons.\nOne of the waltzers, however, who was familiarly called Viscount, and whose low cut waistcoat seemed\nmoulded to his chest, came a second time to ask Madame Bovary to dance, assuring her that he would\nguide her, and that she would get through it very well.\nThey began slowly, then went more rapidly. They turned; all around them was turning--the lamps, the\nfurniture, the wainscoting, the floor, like a disc on a pivot. On passing near the doors the bottom of\nEmma's dress caught against his trousers.\nTheir legs commingled; he looked down at her; she raised her eyes to his. A torpor seized her; she\nstopped. They started again, and with a more rapid movement; the Viscount, dragging her along\ndisappeared with her to the end of the gallery, where panting, she almost fell, and for a moment rested her\nhead upon his breast. And then, still turning, but more slowly, he guided her back to her seat. She leaned\nback against the wall and covered her eyes with her hands.\nWhen she opened them again, in the middle of the drawing room three waltzers were kneeling before a\nlady sitting on a stool.\nShe chose the Viscount, and the violin struck up once more.\nEveryone looked at them. They passed and re-passed, she with rigid body, her chin bent down, and he\nalways in the same pose, his figure curved, his elbow rounded, his chin thrown forward. That woman\nknew how to waltz! They kept up a long time, and tired out all the others.\nThen they talked a few moments longer, and after the goodnights, or rather good mornings, the guests of\nthe chateau retired to bed.\nCharles dragged himself up by the balusters. His \"knees were going up into his body.\" He had spent five\n-26\n\nconsecutive hours standing bolt upright at the card tables, watching them play whist, without\nunderstanding anything about it, and it was with a deep sigh of relief that he pulled off his boots.\nEmma threw a shawl over her shoulders, opened the window, and leant out.\nThe night was dark; some drops of rain were falling. She breathed in the damp wind that refreshed her\neyelids. The music of the ball was still murmuring in her ears. And she tried to keep herself awake in\norder to prolong the illusion that this luxurious life that she would soon have to give up.\nDay began to break. She looked long at the windows of the chateau, trying to guess which were the rooms\nof all those she had noticed the evening before. She would fain have known their lives, have penetrated,\nblended with them. But she was shivering with cold. She undressed, and cowered down between the\nsheets against Charles, who was asleep.\nThere were a great many people to luncheon. The repast lasted ten minutes; no liqueurs were served,\nwhich astonished the doctor.\nNext, Mademoiselle d'Andervilliers collected some pieces of roll in a small basket to take them to the\nswans on the ornamental waters, and they went to walk in the hot-houses, where strange plants, bristling\nwith hairs, rose in pyramids under hanging vases, whence, as from over-filled nests of serpents, fell long\ngreen cords interlacing. The orangery, which was at the other end, led by a covered way to the outhouses\nof the chateau. The Marquis, to amuse the young woman, took her to see the stables.\nAbove the basket-shaped racks porcelain slabs bore the names of the horses in black letters. Each animal\nin its stall whisked its tail when anyone went near and said \"Tchk! tchk!\" The boards of the harness room\nshone like the flooring of a drawing room. The carriage harness was piled up in the middle against two\ntwisted columns, and the bits, the whips, the spurs, the curbs, were ranged in a line all along the wall.\nCharles, meanwhile, went to ask a groom to put his horse to. The dog-cart was brought to the foot of the\nsteps, and, all the parcels being crammed in, the Bovarys paid their respects to the Marquis and\nMarchioness and set out again for Tostes.\nEmma watched the turning wheels in silence. Charles, on the extreme edge of the seat, held the reins with\nhis two arms wide apart, and the little horse ambled along in the shafts that were too big for him. The\nloose reins hanging over his crupper were wet with foam, and the box fastened on behind the chaise gave\ngreat regular bumps against it.\nThey were on the heights of Thibourville when suddenly some horsemen with cigars between their lips\npassed laughing. Emma thought she recognized the Viscount, turned back, and caught on the horizon only\nthe movement of the heads rising or falling with the unequal cadence of the trot or gallop.\nA mile farther on they had to stop to mend with some string the traces that had broken.\nBut Charles, giving a last look to the harness, saw something on the ground between his horse's legs, and\nhe picked up a cigar-case with a green silk border and beblazoned in the centre like the door of a carriage.\n\"There are even two cigars in it,\" said he; \"they'll do for this evening after dinner.\"\n\"Why, do you smoke?\" she asked.\n\"Sometimes, when I get a chance.\"\n-27\n\nHe put his find in his pocket and whipped up the nag.\nWhen they reached home the dinner was not ready. Madame lost her temper. Nastasie answered rudely.\n\"Leave the room!\" said Emma. \"You are forgetting yourself. I give you warning.\"\nFor dinner there was onion soup and a piece of veal with sorrel.\nCharles, seated opposite Emma, rubbed his hands gleefully.\n\"How good it is to be at home again!\"\nNastasie could be heard crying. He was rather fond of the poor girl. She had formerly, during the\nwearisome time of his widowhood, kept him company many an evening. She had been his first patient,\nhis oldest acquaintance in the place.\n\"Have you given her warning for good?\" he asked at last.\n\"Yes. Who is to prevent me?\" she replied.\nThen they warmed themselves in the kitchen while their room was being made ready. Charles began to\nsmoke. He smoked with lips protruding, spitting every moment, recoiling at every puff.\n\"You'll make yourself ill,\" she said scornfully.\nHe put down his cigar and ran to swallow a glass of cold water at the pump. Emma seizing hold of the\ncigar case threw it quickly to the back of the cupboard.\nThe next day was a long one. She walked about her little garden, up and down the same walks, stopping\nbefore the beds, before the espalier, before the plaster curate, looking with amazement at all these things\nof once-on-a-time that she knew so well. How far off the ball seemed already! What was it that thus set so\nfar asunder the morning of the day before yesterday and the evening of to-day? Her journey to\nVaubyessard had made a hole in her life, like one of those great crevices that a storm will sometimes\nmake in one night in mountains. Still she was resigned. She devoutly put away in her drawers her\nbeautiful dress, down to the satin shoes whose soles were yellowed with the slippery wax of the dancing\nfloor. Her heart was like these. In its friction against wealth something had come over it that could not be\neffaced.\nThe memory of this ball, then, became an occupation for Emma.\nWhenever the Wednesday came round she said to herself as she awoke, \"Ah! I was there a week--a\nfortnight--three weeks ago.\"\nAnd little by little the faces grew confused in her remembrance.\nShe forgot the tune of the quadrilles; she no longer saw the liveries and appointments so distinctly; some\ndetails escaped her, but the regret remained with her.\nChapter Nine\nOften when Charles was out she took from the cupboard, between the folds of the linen where she had left\nit, the green silk cigar case. She looked at it, opened it, and even smelt the odour of the lining--a mixture\n-28\n\nof verbena and tobacco. Whose was it? The Viscount's? Perhaps it was a present from his mistress. It had\nbeen embroidered on some rosewood frame, a pretty little thing, hidden from all eyes, that had occupied\nmany hours, and over which had fallen the soft curls of the pensive worker. A breath of love had passed\nover the stitches on the canvas; each prick of the needle had fixed there a hope or a memory, and all those\ninterwoven threads of silk were but the continuity of the same silent passion. And then one morning the\nViscount had taken it away with him. Of what had they spoken when it lay upon the wide-mantelled\nchimneys between flower-vases and Pompadour clocks? She was at Tostes; he was at Paris now, far\naway! What was this Paris like? What a vague name! She repeated it in a low voice, for the mere pleasure\nof it; it rang in her ears like a great cathedral bell; it shone before her eyes, even on the labels of her\npomade-pots.\nAt night, when the carriers passed under her windows in their carts singing the \"Marjolaine,\" she awoke,\nand listened to the noise of the iron-bound wheels, which, as they gained the country road, was soon\ndeadened by the soil. \"They will be there to-morrow!\" she said to herself.\nAnd she followed them in thought up and down the hills, traversing villages, gliding along the highroads\nby the light of the stars. At the end of some indefinite distance there was always a confused spot, into\nwhich her dream died.\nShe bought a plan of Paris, and with the tip of her finger on the map she walked about the capital. She\nwent up the boulevards, stopping at every turning, between the lines of the streets, in front of the white\nsquares that represented the houses. At last she would close the lids of her weary eyes, and see in the\ndarkness the gas jets flaring in the wind and the steps of carriages lowered with much noise before the\nperistyles of theatres.\nShe took in \"La Corbeille,\" a lady's journal, and the \"Sylphe des Salons.\" She devoured, without skipping\na work, all the accounts of first nights, races, and soirees, took interest in the debut of a singer, in the\nopening of a new shop. She knew the latest fashions, the addresses of the best tailors, the days of the Bois\nand the Opera. In Eugene Sue she studied descriptions of furniture; she read Balzac and George Sand,\nseeking in them imaginary satisfaction for her own desires. Even at table she had her book by her, and\nturned over the pages while Charles ate and talked to her. The memory of the Viscount always returned as\nshe read. Between him and the imaginary personages she made comparisons. But the circle of which he\nwas the centre gradually widened round him, and the aureole that he bore, fading from his form,\nbroadened out beyond, lighting up her other dreams.\nParis, more vague than the ocean, glimmered before Emma's eyes in an atmosphere of vermilion. The\nmany lives that stirred amid this tumult were, however, divided into parts, classed as distinct pictures.\nEmma perceived only two or three that hid from her all the rest, and in themselves represented all\nhumanity. The world of ambassadors moved over polished floors in drawing rooms lined with mirrors,\nround oval tables covered with velvet and gold-fringed cloths. There were dresses with trains, deep\nmysteries, anguish hidden beneath smiles. Then came the society of the duchesses; all were pale; all got\nup at four o'clock; the women, poor angels, wore English point on their petticoats; and the men,\nunappreciated geniuses under a frivolous outward seeming, rode horses to death at pleasure parties, spent\nthe summer season at Baden, and towards the forties married heiresses. In the private rooms of\nrestaurants, where one sups after midnight by the light of wax candles, laughed the motley crowd of men\nof letters and actresses. They were prodigal as kings, full of ideal, ambitious, fantastic frenzy. This was an\nexistence outside that of all others, between heaven and earth, in the midst of storms, having something of\nthe sublime. For the rest of the world it was lost, with no particular place and as if non-existent. The\nnearer things were, moreover, the more her thoughts turned away from them. All her immediate\nsurroundings, the wearisome country, the middle-class imbeciles, the mediocrity of existence, seemed to\nher exceptional, a peculiar chance that had caught hold of her, while beyond stretched, as far as eye could\n-29\n\nsee, an immense land of joys and passions. She confused in her desire the sensualities of luxury with the\ndelights of the heart, elegance of manners with delicacy of sentiment. Did not love, like Indian plants,\nneed a special soil, a particular temperature? Signs by moonlight, long embraces, tears flowing over\nyielded hands, all the fevers of the flesh and the languors of tenderness could not be separated from the\nbalconies of great castles full of indolence, from boudoirs with silken curtains and thick carpets,\nwell-filled flower-stands, a bed on a raised dias, nor from the flashing of precious stones and the\nshoulder-knots of liveries.\nThe lad from the posting house who came to groom the mare every morning passed through the passage\nwith his heavy wooden shoes; there were holes in his blouse; his feet were bare in list slippers. And this\nwas the groom in knee-britches with whom she had to be content! His work done, he did not come back\nagain all day, for Charles on his return put up his horse himself, unsaddled him and put on the halter,\nwhile the servant-girl brought a bundle of straw and threw it as best she could into the manger.\nTo replace Nastasie (who left Tostes shedding torrents of tears) Emma took into her service a young girl\nof fourteen, an orphan with a sweet face. She forbade her wearing cotton caps, taught her to address her in\nthe third person, to bring a glass of water on a plate, to knock before coming into a room, to iron, starch,\nand to dress her--wanted to make a lady's-maid of her. The new servant obeyed without a murmur, so as\nnot to be sent away; and as madame usually left the key in the sideboard, Felicite every evening took a\nsmall supply of sugar that she ate alone in her bed after she had said her prayers.\nSometimes in the afternoon she went to chat with the postilions.\nMadame was in her room upstairs. She wore an open dressing gown that showed between the shawl\nfacings of her bodice a pleated chamisette with three gold buttons. Her belt was a corded girdle with great\ntassels, and her small garnet coloured slippers had a large knot of ribbon that fell over her instep. She had\nbought herself a blotting book, writing case, pen-holder, and envelopes, although she had no one to write\nto; she dusted her what-not, looked at herself in the glass, picked up a book, and then, dreaming between\nthe lines, let it drop on her knees. She longed to travel or to go back to her convent. She wished at the\nsame time to die and to live in Paris.\nCharles in snow and rain trotted across country. He ate omelettes on farmhouse tables, poked his arm into\ndamp beds, received the tepid spurt of blood-lettings in his face, listened to death-rattles, examined\nbasins, turned over a good deal of dirty linen; but every evening he found a blazing fire, his dinner ready,\neasy-chairs, and a well-dressed woman, charming with an odour of freshness, though no one could say\nwhence the perfume came, or if it were not her skin that made odorous her chemise.\nShe charmed him by numerous attentions; now it was some new way of arranging paper sconces for the\ncandles, a flounce that she altered on her gown, or an extraordinary name for some very simple dish that\nthe servant had spoilt, but that Charles swallowed with pleasure to the last mouthful. At Rouen she saw\nsome ladies who wore a bunch of charms on the watch-chains; she bought some charms. She wanted for\nher mantelpiece two large blue glass vases, and some time after an ivory necessaire with a silver-gilt\nthimble. The less Charles understood these refinements the more they seduced him. They added\nsomething to the pleasure of the senses and to the comfort of his fireside. It was like a golden dust\nsanding all along the narrow path of his life.\nHe was well, looked well; his reputation was firmly established.\nThe country-folk loved him because he was not proud. He petted the children, never went to the public\nhouse, and, moreover, his morals inspired confidence. He was specially successful with catarrhs and chest\ncomplaints. Being much afraid of killing his patients, Charles, in fact only prescribed sedatives, from time\n-30\n\nto time and emetic, a footbath, or leeches. It was not that he was afraid of surgery; he bled people\ncopiously like horses, and for the taking out of teeth he had the \"devil's own wrist.\"\nFinally, to keep up with the times, he took in \"La Ruche Medicale,\" a new journal whose prospectus had\nbeen sent him. He read it a little after dinner, but in about five minutes the warmth of the room added to\nthe effect of his dinner sent him to sleep; and he sat there, his chin on his two hands and his hair spreading\nlike a mane to the foot of the lamp. Emma looked at him and shrugged her shoulders. Why, at least, was\nnot her husband one of those men of taciturn passions who work at their books all night, and at last, when\nabout sixty, the age of rheumatism sets in, wear a string of orders on their ill-fitting black coat? She could\nhave wished this name of Bovary, which was hers, had been illustrious, to see it displayed at the\nbooksellers', repeated in the newspapers, known to all France. But Charles had no ambition.\nAn Yvetot doctor whom he had lately met in consultation had somewhat humiliated him at the very\nbedside of the patient, before the assembled relatives. When, in the evening, Charles told her this\nanecdote, Emma inveighed loudly against his colleague. Charles was much touched. He kissed her\nforehead with a tear in his eyes. But she was angered with shame; she felt a wild desire to strike him; she\nwent to open the window in the passage and breathed in the fresh air to calm herself.\n\"What a man! What a man!\" she said in a low voice, biting her lips.\nBesides, she was becoming more irritated with him. As he grew older his manner grew heavier; at dessert\nhe cut the corks of the empty bottles; after eating he cleaned his teeth with his tongue; in taking soup he\nmade a gurgling noise with every spoonful; and, as he was getting fatter, the puffed-out cheeks seemed to\npush the eyes, always small, up to the temples.\nSometimes Emma tucked the red borders of his under-vest unto his waistcoat, rearranged his cravat, and\nthrew away the dirty gloves he was going to put on; and this was not, as he fancied, for himself; it was for\nherself, by a diffusion of egotism, of nervous irritation. Sometimes, too, she told him of what she had\nread, such as a passage in a novel, of a new play, or an anecdote of the \"upper ten\" that she had seen in a\nfeuilleton; for, after all, Charles was something, an ever-open ear, and ever-ready approbation. She\nconfided many a thing to her greyhound. She would have done so to the logs in the fireplace or to the\npendulum of the clock.\nAt the bottom of her heart, however, she was waiting for something to happen. Like shipwrecked sailors,\nshe turned despairing eyes upon the solitude of her life, seeking afar off some white sail in the mists of\nthe horizon. She did not know what this chance would be, what wind would bring it her, towards what\nshore it would drive her, if it would be a shallop or a three-decker, laden with anguish or full of bliss to\nthe portholes. But each morning, as she awoke, she hoped it would come that day; she listened to every\nsound, sprang up with a start, wondered that it did not come; then at sunset, always more saddened, she\nlonged for the morrow.\nSpring came round. With the first warm weather, when the pear trees began to blossom, she suffered from\ndyspnoea.\nFrom the beginning of July she counted how many weeks there were to October, thinking that perhaps the\nMarquis d'Andervilliers would give another ball at Vaubyessard. But all September passed without letters\nor visits.\nAfter the ennui of this disappointment her heart once more remained empty, and then the same series of\ndays recommenced. So now they would thus follow one another, always the same, immovable, and\nbringing nothing. Other lives, however flat, had at least the chance of some event. One adventure\n-31\n\nsometimes brought with it infinite consequences and the scene changed. But nothing happened to her;\nGod had willed it so! The future was a dark corridor, with its door at the end shut fast.\nShe gave up music. What was the good of playing? Who would hear her? Since she could never, in a\nvelvet gown with short sleeves, striking with her light fingers the ivory keys of an Erard at a concert, feel\nthe murmur of ecstasy envelop her like a breeze, it was not worth while boring herself with practicing.\nHer drawing cardboard and her embroidery she left in the cupboard. What was the good? What was the\ngood? Sewing irritated her. \"I have read everything,\" she said to herself. And she sat there making the\ntongs red-hot, or looked at the rain falling.\nHow sad she was on Sundays when vespers sounded! She listened with dull attention to each stroke of the\ncracked bell. A cat slowly walking over some roof put up his back in the pale rays of the sum. The wind\non the highroad blew up clouds of dust. Afar off a dog sometimes howled; and the bell, keeping time,\ncontinued its monotonous ringing that died away over the fields.\nBut the people came out from church. The women in waxed clogs, the peasants in new blouses, the little\nbare-headed children skipping along in front of them, all were going home. And till nightfall, five or six\nmen, always the same, stayed playing at corks in front of the large door of the inn.\nThe winter was severe. The windows every morning were covered with rime, and the light shining\nthrough them, dim as through ground-glass, sometimes did not change the whole day long. At four\no'clock the lamp had to be lighted.\nOn fine days she went down into the garden. The dew had left on the cabbages a silver lace with long\ntransparent threads spreading from one to the other. No birds were to be heard; everything seemed asleep,\nthe espalier covered with straw, and the vine, like a great sick serpent under the coping of the wall, along\nwhich, on drawing hear, one saw the many-footed woodlice crawling. Under the spruce by the hedgerow,\nthe curie in the three-cornered hat reading his breviary had lost his right foot, and the very plaster, scaling\noff with the frost, had left white scabs on his face.\nThen she went up again, shut her door, put on coals, and fainting with the heat of the hearth, felt her\nboredom weigh more heavily than ever. She would have like to go down and talk to the servant, but a\nsense of shame restrained her.\nEvery day at the same time the schoolmaster in a black skullcap opened the shutters of his house, and the\nrural policeman, wearing his sabre over his blouse, passed by. Night and morning the post-horses, three\nby three, crossed the street to water at the pond. From time to time the bell of a public house door rang,\nand when it was windy one could hear the little brass basins that served as signs for the hairdresser's shop\ncreaking on their two rods. This shop had as decoration an old engraving of a fashion-plate stuck against a\nwindowpane and the wax bust of a woman with yellow hair. He, too, the hairdresser, lamented his wasted\ncalling, his hopeless future, and dreaming of some shop in a big town--at Rouen, for example,\noverlooking the harbour, near the theatre--he walked up and down all day from the mairie to the church,\nsombre and waiting for customers. When Madame Bovary looked up, she always saw him there, like a\nsentinel on duty, with his skullcap over his ears and his vest of lasting.\nSometimes in the afternoon outside the window of her room, the head of a man appeared, a swarthy head\nwith black whiskers, smiling slowly, with a broad, gentle smile that showed his white teeth. A waltz\nimmediately began and on the organ, in a little drawing room, dancers the size of a finger, women in pink\nturbans, Tyrolians in jackets, monkeys in frock coats, gentlemen in knee-breeches, turned and turned\nbetween the sofas, the consoles, multiplied in the bits of looking glass held together at their corners by a\npiece of gold paper. The man turned his handle, looking to the right and left, and up at the windows. Now\n-32\n\nand again, while he shot out a long squirt of brown saliva against the milestone, with his knee raised his\ninstrument, whose hard straps tired his shoulder; and now, doleful and drawling, or gay and hurried, the\nmusic escaped from the box, droning through a curtain of pink taffeta under a brass claw in arabesque.\nThey were airs played in other places at the theatres, sung in drawing rooms, danced to at night under\nlighted lustres, echoes of the world that reached even to Emma. Endless sarabands ran through her head,\nand, like an Indian dancing girl on the flowers of a carpet, her thoughts leapt with the notes, swung from\ndream to dream, from sadness to sadness. When the man had caught some coppers in his cap, he drew\ndown an old cover of blue cloth, hitched his organ on to his back, and went off with a heavy tread. She\nwatched him going.\nBut it was above all the meal-times that were unbearable to her, in this small room on the ground floor,\nwith its smoking stove, its creaking door, the walls that sweated, the damp flags; all the bitterness in life\nseemed served up on her plate, and with smoke of the boiled beef there rose from her secret soul whiffs of\nsickliness. Charles was a slow eater; she played with a few nuts, or, leaning on her elbow, amused herself\nwith drawing lines along the oilcloth table cover with the point of her knife.\nShe now let everything in her household take care of itself, and Madame Bovary senior, when she came\nto spend part of Lent at Tostes, was much surprised at the change. She who was formerly so careful, so\ndainty, now passed whole days without dressing, wore grey cotton stockings, and burnt tallow candles.\nShe kept saying they must be economical since they were not rich, adding that she was very contented,\nvery happy, that Tostes pleased her very much, with other speeches that closed the mouth of her\nmother-in-law. Besides, Emma no longer seemed inclined to follow her advice; once even, Madame\nBovary having thought fit to maintain that mistresses ought to keep an eye on the religion of their\nservants, she had answered with so angry a look and so cold a smile that the good woman did not interfere\nagain.\nEmma was growing difficult, capricious. She ordered dishes for herself, then she did not touch them; one\nday drank only pure milk, the next cups of tea by the dozen. Often she persisted in not going out, then,\nstifling, threw open the windows and put on light dresses. After she had well scolded her servant she gave\nher presents or sent her out to see neighbours, just as she sometimes threw beggars all the silver in her\npurse, although she was by no means tender-hearted or easily accessible to the feelings of others, like\nmost country-bred people, who always retain in their souls something of the horny hardness of the\npaternal hands.\nTowards the end of February old Rouault, in memory of his cure, himself brought his son-in-law a superb\nturkey, and stayed three days at Tostes. Charles being with his patients, Emma kept him company. He\nsmoked in the room, spat on the firedogs, talked farming, calves, cows, poultry, and municipal council, so\nthat when he left she closed the door on him with a feeling of satisfaction that surprised even herself.\nMoreover she no longer concealed her contempt for anything or anybody, and at times she set herself to\nexpress singular opinions, finding fault with that which others approved, and approving things perverse\nand immoral, all of which made her husband open his eyes widely.\nWould this misery last for ever? Would she never issue from it? Yet she was as good as all the women\nwho were living happily. She had seen duchesses at Vaubyessard with clumsier waists and commoner\nways, and she execrated the injustice of God. She leant her head against the walls to weep; she envied\nlives of stir; longed for masked balls, for violent pleasures, with all the wildness that she did not know,\nbut that these must surely yield.\nShe grew pale and suffered from palpitations of the heart.\nCharles prescribed valerian and camphor baths. Everything that was tried only seemed to irritate her the\n-33\n\nmore.\nOn certain days she chatted with feverish rapidity, and this over-excitement was suddenly followed by a\nstate of torpor, in which she remained without speaking, without moving. What then revived her was\npouring a bottle of eau-de-cologne over her arms.\nAs she was constantly complaining about Tostes, Charles fancied that her illness was no doubt due to\nsome local cause, and fixing on this idea, began to think seriously of setting up elsewhere.\nFrom that moment she drank vinegar, contracted a sharp little cough, and completely lost her appetite.\nIt cost Charles much to give up Tostes after living there four years and \"when he was beginning to get on\nthere.\" Yet if it must be! He took her to Rouen to see his old master. It was a nervous complaint: change\nof air was needed.\nAfter looking about him on this side and on that, Charles learnt that in the Neufchatel arrondissement\nthere was a considerable market town called Yonville-l'Abbaye, whose doctor, a Polish refugee, had\ndecamped a week before. Then he wrote to the chemist of the place to ask the number of the population,\nthe distance from the nearest doctor, what his predecessor had made a year, and so forth; and the answer\nbeing satisfactory, he made up his mind to move towards the spring, if Emma's health did not improve.\nOne day when, in view of her departure, she was tidying a drawer, something pricked her finger. It was a\nwire of her wedding bouquet. The orange blossoms were yellow with dust and the silver bordered satin\nribbons frayed at the edges. She threw it into the fire. It flared up more quickly than dry straw. Then it\nwas, like a red bush in the cinders, slowly devoured. She watched it burn.\nThe little pasteboard berries burst, the wire twisted, the gold lace melted; and the shriveled paper corollas,\nfluttering like black butterflies at the back of the stove, at least flew up the chimney.\nWhen they left Tostes at the month of March, Madame Bovary was pregnant.\nPART II\nChapter One\nYonville-l'Abbaye (so called from an old Capuchin abbey of which not even the ruins remain) is a\nmarket-town twenty-four miles from Rouen, between the Abbeville and Beauvais roads, at the foot of a\nvalley watered by the Rieule, a little river that runs into the Andelle after turning three water-mills near its\nmouth, where there are a few trout that the lads amuse themselves by fishing for on Sundays.\nWe leave the highroad at La Boissiere and keep straight on to the top of the Leux hill, whence the valley\nis seen. The river that runs through it makes of it, as it were, two regions with distinct physiognomies--all\non the left is pasture land, all of the right arable. The meadow stretches under a bulge of low hills to join\nat the back with the pasture land of the Bray country, while on the eastern side, the plain, gently rising,\nbroadens out, showing as far as eye can follow its blond cornfields. The water, flowing by the grass,\ndivides with a white line the colour of the roads and of the plains, and the country is like a great unfolded\nmantle with a green velvet cape bordered with a fringe of silver.\n-34\n\nBefore us, on the verge of the horizon, lie the oaks of the forest of Argueil, with the steeps of the\nSaint-Jean hills scarred from top to bottom with red irregular lines; they are rain tracks, and these\nbrick-tones standing out in narrow streaks against the grey colour of the mountain are due to the quantity\nof iron springs that flow beyond in the neighboring country.\nHere we are on the confines of Normandy, Picardy, and the Ile-de-France, a bastard land whose language\nis without accent and its landscape is without character. It is there that they make the worst Neufchatel\ncheeses of all the arrondissement; and, on the other hand, farming is costly because so much manure is\nneeded to enrich this friable soil full of sand and flints.\nUp to 1835 there was no practicable road for getting to Yonville, but about this time a cross-road was\nmade which joins that of Abbeville to that of Amiens, and is occasionally used by the Rouen wagoners on\ntheir way to Flanders. Yonville-l'Abbaye has remained stationary in spite of its \"new outlet.\" Instead of\nimproving the soil, they persist in keeping up the pasture lands, however depreciated they may be in\nvalue, and the lazy borough, growing away from the plain, has naturally spread riverwards. It is seem\nfrom afar sprawling along the banks like a cowherd taking a siesta by the water-side.\nAt the foot of the hill beyond the bridge begins a roadway, planted with young aspens, that leads in a\nstraight line to the first houses in the place. These, fenced in by hedges, are in the middle of courtyards\nfull of straggling buildings, wine-presses, cart-sheds and distilleries scattered under thick trees, with\nladders, poles, or scythes hung on to the branches. The thatched roofs, like fur caps drawn over eyes,\nreach down over about a third of the low windows, whose coarse convex glasses have knots in the middle\nlike the bottoms of bottles. Against the plaster wall diagonally crossed by black joists, a meagre pear-tree\nsometimes leans and the ground-floors have at their door a small swing-gate to keep out the chicks that\ncome pilfering crumbs of bread steeped in cider on the threshold. But the courtyards grow narrower, the\nhouses closer together, and the fences disappear; a bundle of ferns swings under a window from the end\nof a broomstick; there is a blacksmith's forge and then a wheelwright's, with two or three new carts\noutside that partly block the way. Then across an open space appears a white house beyond a grass mound\nornamented by a Cupid, his finger on his lips; two brass vases are at each end of a flight of steps;\nscutcheons[9] blaze upon the door. It is the notary's house, and the finest in the place.\n[9]The panonceaux that have to be hung over the doors of notaries.\nThe Church is on the other side of the street, twenty paces farther down, at the entrance of the square. The\nlittle cemetery that surrounds it, closed in by a wall breast high, is so full of graves that the old stones,\nlevel with the ground, form a continuous pavement, on which the grass of itself has marked out regular\ngreen squares. The church was rebuilt during the last years of the reign of Charles X. The wooden roof is\nbeginning to rot from the top, and here and there has black hollows in its blue colour. Over the door,\nwhere the organ should be, is a loft for the men, with a spiral staircase that reverberates under their\nwooden shoes.\nThe daylight coming through the plain glass windows falls obliquely upon the pews ranged along the\nwalls, which are adorned here and there with a straw mat bearing beneath it the words in large letters,\n\"Mr. So-and-so's pew.\" Farther on, at a spot where the building narrows, the confessional forms a\npendant to a statuette of the Virgin, clothed in a satin robe, coifed with a tulle veil sprinkled with silver\nstars, and with red cheeks, like an idol of the Sandwich Islands; and, finally, a copy of the \"Holy Family,\npresented by the Minister of the Interior,\" overlooking the high altar, between four candlesticks, closes in\nthe perspective. The choir stalls, of deal wood, have been left unpainted.\nThe market, that is to say, a tiled roof supported by some twenty posts, occupies of itself about half the\npublic square of Yonville. The town hall, constructed \"from the designs of a Paris architect,\" is a sort of\n-35\n\nGreek temple that forms the corner next to the chemist's shop. On the ground-floor are three Ionic\ncolumns and on the first floor a semicircular gallery, while the dome that crowns it is occupied by a Gallic\ncock, resting one foot upon the \"Charte\" and holding in the other the scales of Justice.\nBut that which most attracts the eye is opposite the Lion d'Or inn, the chemist's shop of Monsieur\nHomais. In the evening especially its argand lamp is lit up and the red and green jars that embellish his\nshop-front throw far across the street their two streams of colour; then across them as if in Bengal lights is\nseen the shadow of the chemist leaning over his desk. His house from top to bottom is placarded with\ninscriptions written in large hand, round hand, printed hand: \"Vichy, Seltzer, Barege waters, blood\npurifiers, Raspail patent medicine, Arabian racahout, Darcet lozenges, Regnault paste, trusses, baths,\nhygienic chocolate,\" etc. And the signboard, which takes up all the breadth of the shop, bears in gold\nletters, \"Homais, Chemist.\" Then at the back of the shop, behind the great scales fixed to the counter, the\nword \"Laboratory\" appears on a scroll above a glass door, which about half-way up once more repeats\n\"Homais\" in gold letters on a black ground.\nBeyond this there is nothing to see at Yonville. The street (the only one) a gunshot in length and flanked\nby a few shops on either side stops short at the turn of the highroad. If it is left on the right hand and the\nfoot of the Saint-Jean hills followed the cemetery is soon reached.\nAt the time of the cholera, in order to enlarge this, a piece of wall was pulled down, and three acres of\nland by its side purchased; but all the new portion is almost tenantless; the tombs, as heretofore, continue\nto crowd together towards the gate. The keeper, who is at once gravedigger and church beadle (thus\nmaking a double profit out of the parish corpses), has taken advantage of the unused plot of ground to\nplant potatoes there. From year to year, however, his small field grows smaller, and when there is an\nepidemic, he does not know whether to rejoice at the deaths or regret the burials.\n\"You live on the dead, Lestiboudois!\" the curie at last said to him one day. This grim remark made him\nreflect; it checked him for some time; but to this day he carries on the cultivation of his little tubers, and\neven maintains stoutly that they grow naturally.\nSince the events about to be narrated, nothing in fact has changed at Yonville. The tin tricolour flag still\nswings at the top of the church-steeple; the two chintz streamers still flutter in the wind from the\nlinen-draper's; the chemist's fetuses, like lumps of white amadou, rot more and more in their turbid\nalcohol, and above the big door of the inn the old golden lion, faded by rain, still shows passers-by its\npoodle mane.\nOn the evening when the Bovarys were to arrive at Yonville, Widow Lefrancois, the landlady of this inn,\nwas so very busy that she sweated great drops as she moved her saucepans. To-morrow was market-day.\nThe meat had to be cut beforehand, the fowls drawn, the soup and coffee made. Moreover, she had the\nboarders' meal to see to, and that of the doctor, his wife, and their servant; the billiard-room was echoing\nwith bursts of laughter; three millers in a small parlour were calling for brandy; the wood was blazing, the\nbrazen pan was hissing, and on the long kitchen table, amid the quarters of raw mutton, rose piles of\nplates that rattled with the shaking of the block on which spinach was being chopped.\nFrom the poultry-yard was heard the screaming of the fowls whom the servant was chasing in order to\nwring their necks.\nA man slightly marked with small-pox, in green leather slippers, and wearing a velvet cap with a gold\ntassel, was warming his back at the chimney. His face expressed nothing but self-satisfaction, and he\nappeared to take life as calmly as the goldfinch suspended over his head in its wicker cage: this was the\nchemist.\n-36\n\n\"Artemise!\" shouted the landlady, \"chop some wood, fill the water bottles, bring some brandy, look\nsharp! If only I knew what dessert to offer the guests you are expecting! Good heavens! Those\nfurniture-movers are beginning their racket in the billiard-room again; and their van has been left before\nthe front door! The 'Hirondelle' might run into it when it draws up. Call Polyte and tell him to put it up.\nOnly think, Monsieur Homais, that since morning they have had about fifteen games, and drunk eight jars\nof cider! Why, they'll tear my cloth for me,\" she went on, looking at them from a distance, her strainer in\nher hand.\n\"That wouldn't be much of a loss,\" replied Monsieur Homais. \"You would buy another.\"\n\"Another billiard-table!\" exclaimed the widow.\n\"Since that one is coming to pieces, Madame Lefrancois. I tell you again you are doing yourself harm,\nmuch harm! And besides, players now want narrow pockets and heavy cues. Hazards aren't played now;\neverything is changed! One must keep pace with the times! Just look at Tellier!\"\nThe hostess reddened with vexation. The chemist went on--\n\"You may say what you like; his table is better than yours; and if one were to think, for example, of\ngetting up a patriotic pool for Poland or the sufferers from the Lyons floods--\"\n\"It isn't beggars like him that'll frighten us,\" interrupted the landlady, shrugging her fat shoulders.\n\"Come, come, Monsieur Homais; as long as the 'Lion d'Or' exists people will come to it. We've\nfeathered our nest; while one of these days you'll find the 'Cafe Francais' closed with a big placard on the\nshutters. Change my billiard-table!\" she went on, speaking to herself, \"the table that comes in so handy\nfor folding the washing, and on which, in the hunting season, I have slept six visitors! But that dawdler,\nHivert, doesn't come!\"\n\"Are you waiting for him for your gentlemen's dinner?\"\n\"Wait for him! And what about Monsieur Binet? As the clock strikes six you'll see him come in, for he\nhasn't his equal under the sun for punctuality. He must always have his seat in the small parlour. He'd\nrather die than dine anywhere else. And so squeamish as he is, and so particular about the cider! Not like\nMonsieur Leon; he sometimes comes at seven, or even half-past, and he doesn't so much as look at what\nhe eats. Such a nice young man! Never speaks a rough word!\"\n\"Well, you see, there's a great difference between an educated man and an old carabineer who is now a\ntax-collector.\"\nSix o'clock struck. Binet came in.\nHe wore a blue frock-coat falling in a straight line round his thin body, and his leather cap, with its\nlappets knotted over the top of his head with string, showed under the turned-up peak a bald forehead,\nflattened by the constant wearing of a helmet. He wore a black cloth waistcoat, a hair collar, grey trousers,\nand, all the year round, well-blacked boots, that had two parallel swellings due to the sticking out of his\nbig-toes. Not a hair stood out from the regular line of fair whiskers, which, encircling his jaws, framed,\nafter the fashion of a garden border, his long, wan face, whose eyes were small and the nose hooked.\nClever at all games of cards, a good hunter, and writing a fine hand, he had at home a lathe, and amused\nhimself by turning napkin rings, with which he filled up his house, with the jealousy of an artist and the\negotism of a bourgeois.\n-37\n\nHe went to the small parlour, but the three millers had to be got out first, and during the whole time\nnecessary for laying the cloth, Binet remained silent in his place near the stove. Then he shut the door and\ntook off his cap in his usual way.\n\"It isn't with saying civil things that he'll wear out his tongue,\" said the chemist, as soon as he was along\nwith the landlady.\n\"He never talks more,\" she replied. \"Last week two travelers in the cloth line were here--such clever\nchaps who told such jokes in the evening, that I fairly cried with laughing; and he stood there like a dab\nfish and never said a word.\"\n\"Yes,\" observed the chemist; \"no imagination, no sallies, nothing that makes the society-man.\"\n\"Yet they say he has parts,\" objected the landlady.\n\"Parts!\" replied Monsieur Homais; \"he, parts! In his own line it is possible,\" he added in a calmer tone.\nAnd he went on--\n\"Ah! That a merchant, who has large connections, a jurisconsult, a doctor, a chemist, should be thus\nabsent-minded, that the should become whimsical or even peevish, I can understand; such cases are cited\nin history. But at least it is because they are thinking of something. Myself, for example, how often has it\nhappened to me to look on the bureau for my pen to write a label, and to find, after all, that I had put it\nbehind my ear!\"\nMadame Lefrancois just then went to the door to see if the \"Hirondelle\" were not coming. She started. A\nman dressed in black suddenly came into the kitchen. By the last gleam of the twilight one could see that\nhis face was rubicund and his form athletic.\n\"What can I do for you, Monsieur le Curie?\" asked the landlady, as she reached down from the chimney\none of the copper candlesticks placed with their candles in a row. \"Will you take something? A thimbleful\nof Cassis[10]? A glass of wine?\"\n[10]Black currant liqueur.\nThe priest declined very politely. He had come for his umbrella, that he had forgotten the other day at the\nErnemont convent, and after asking Madame Lefrancois to have it sent to him at the presbytery in the\nevening, he left for the church, from which the Angelus was ringing.\nWhen the chemist no longer heard the noise of his boots along the square, he thought the priest's\nbehaviour just now very unbecoming. This refusal to take any refreshment seemed to him the most odious\nhypocrisy; all priests tippled on the sly, and were trying to bring back the days of the tithe.\nThe landlady took up the defence of her curie.\n\"Besides, he could double up four men like you over his knee. Last year he helped our people to bring in\nthe straw; he carried as many as six trusses at once, he is so strong.\"\n\"Bravo!\" said the chemist. \"Now just send your daughters to confess to fellows which such a\ntemperament! I, if I were the Government, I'd have the priests bled once a month. Yes, Madame\nLefrancois, every month--a good phlebotomy, in the interests of the police and morals.\"\n-38\n\n\"Be quiet, Monsieur Homais. You are an infidel; you've no religion.\"\nThe chemist answered: \"I have a religion, my religion, and I even have more than all these others with\ntheir mummeries and their juggling. I adore God, on the contrary. I believe in the Supreme Being, in a\nCreator, whatever he may be. I care little who has placed us here below to fulfil our duties as citizens and\nfathers of families; but I don't need to go to church to kiss silver plates, and fatten, out of my pocket, a lot\nof good-for-nothings who live better than we do. For one can know Him as well in a wood, in a field, or\neven contemplating the eternal vault like the ancients. My God! Mine is the God of Socrates, of Franklin,\nof Voltaire, and of Beranger! I am for the profession of faith of the 'Savoyard Vicar,' and the immortal\nprinciples of '89! And I can't admit of an old boy of a God who takes walks in his garden with a cane in\nhis hand, who lodges his friends in the belly of whales, dies uttering a cry, and rises again at the end of\nthree days; things absurd in themselves, and completely opposed, moreover, to all physical laws, which\nprove to us, by the way, that priests have always wallowed in turpid ignorance, in which they would fain\nengulf the people with them.\"\nHe ceased, looking round for an audience, for in his bubbling over the chemist had for a moment fancied\nhimself in the midst of the town council. But the landlady no longer heeded him; she was listening to a\ndistant rolling. One could distinguish the noise of a carriage mingled with the clattering of loose\nhorseshoes that beat against the ground, and at last the \"Hirondelle\" stopped at the door.\nIt was a yellow box on two large wheels, that, reaching to the tilt, prevented travelers from seeing the\nroad and dirtied their shoulders. The small panes of the narrow windows rattled in their sashes when the\ncoach was closed, and retained here and there patches of mud amid the old layers of dust, that not even\nstorms of rain had altogether washed away. It was drawn by three horses, the first a leader, and when it\ncame down-hill its bottom jolted against the ground.\nSome of the inhabitants of Yonville came out into the square; they all spoke at once, asking for news, for\nexplanations, for hampers. Hivert did not know whom to answer. It was he who did the errands of the\nplace in town. He went to the shops and brought back rolls of leather for the shoemaker, old iron for the\nfarrier, a barrel of herrings for his mistress, caps from the milliner's, locks from the hair-dresser's and all\nalong the road on his return journey he distributed his parcels, which he threw, standing upright on his\nseat and shouting at the top of his voice, over the enclosures of the yards.\nAn accident had delayed him. Madame Bovary's greyhound had run across the field. They had whistled\nfor him a quarter of an hour; Hivert had even gone back a mile and a half expecting every moment to\ncatch sight of her; but it had been necessary to go on.\nEmma had wept, grown angry; she had accused Charles of this misfortune. Monsieur Lheureux, a draper,\nwho happened to be in the coach with her, had tried to console her by a number of examples of lost dogs\nrecognizing their masters at the end of long years. One, he said had been told of, who had come back to\nParis from Constantinople. Another had gone one hundred and fifty miles in a straight line, and swum\nfour rivers; and his own father had possessed a poodle, which, after twelve years of absence, had all of a\nsudden jumped on his back in the street as he was going to dine in town.\nChapter Two\nEmma got out first, then Felicite, Monsieur Lheureux, and a nurse, and they had to wake up Charles in his\ncorner, where he had slept soundly since night set in.\nHomais introduced himself; he offered his homages to madame and his respects to monsieur; said he was\ncharmed to have been able to render them some slight service, and added with a cordial air that he had\nventured to invite himself, his wife being away.\n-39\n\nWhen Madame Bovary was in the kitchen she went up to the chimney.\nWith the tips of her fingers she caught her dress at the knee, and having thus pulled it up to her ankle,\nheld out her foot in its black boot to the fire above the revolving leg of mutton. The flame lit up the whole\nof her, penetrating with a crude light the woof of her gowns, the fine pores of her fair skin, and even her\neyelids, which she blinked now and again. A great red glow passed over her with the blowing of the wind\nthrough the half-open door.\nOn the other side of the chimney a young man with fair hair watched her silently.\nAs he was a good deal bored at Yonville, where he was a clerk at the notary's, Monsieur Guillaumin,\nMonsieur Leon Dupuis (it was he who was the second habitue of the \"Lion d'Or\") frequently put back his\ndinner-hour in hope that some traveler might come to the inn, with whom he could chat in the evening.\nOn the days when his work was done early, he had, for want of something else to do, to come punctually,\nand endure from soup to cheese a tete-a-tete with Binet. It was therefore with delight that he accepted the\nlandlady's suggestion that he should dine in company with the newcomers, and they passed into the large\nparlour where Madame Lefrancois, for the purpose of showing off, had had the table laid for four.\nHomais asked to be allowed to keep on his skull-cap, for fear of coryza; then, turning to his neighbour--\n\"Madame is no doubt a little fatigued; one gets jolted so abominably in our 'Hirondelle.'\"\n\"That is true,\" replied Emma; \"but moving about always amuses me. I like change of place.\"\n\"It is so tedious,\" sighed the clerk, \"to be always riveted to the same places.\"\n\"If you were like me,\" said Charles, \"constantly obliged to be in the saddle\"--\n\"But,\" Leon went on, addressing himself to Madame Bovary, \"nothing, it seems to me, is more\npleasant--when one can,\" he added.\n\"Moreover,\" said the druggist, \"the practice of medicine is not very hard work in our part of the world,\nfor the state of our roads allows us the use of gigs, and generally, as the farmers are prosperous, they pay\npretty well. We have, medically speaking, besides the ordinary cases of enteritis, bronchitis, bilious\naffections, etc., now and then a few intermittent fevers at harvest-time; but on the whole, little of a serious\nnature, nothing special to note, unless it be a great deal of scrofula, due, no doubt, to the deplorable\nhygienic conditions of our peasant dwellings. Ah! you will find many prejudices to combat, Monsieur\nBovary, much obstinacy of routine, with which all the efforts of your science will daily come into\ncollision; for people still have recourse to novenas, to relics, to the priest, rather than come straight to the\ndoctor of the chemist. The climate, however, is not, truth to tell, bad, and we even have a few\nnonagenarians in our parish. The thermometer (I have made some observations) falls in winter to 4\ndegrees Centigrade at the outside, which gives us 24 degrees Reaumur as the maximum, or otherwise 54\ndegrees Fahrenheit (English scale), not more. And, as a matter of fact, we are sheltered from the north\nwinds by the forest of Argueil on the one side, from the west winds by the St. Jean range on the other; and\nthis heat, moreover, which, on account of the aqueous vapours given off by the river and the considerable\nnumber of cattle in the fields, which, as you know, exhale much ammonia, that is to say, nitrogen,\nhydrogen and oxygen (no, nitrogen and hydrogen alone), and which sucking up into itself the humus from\nthe ground, mixing together all those different emanations, unites them into a stack, so to say, and\ncombining with the electricity diffused through the atmosphere, when there is any, might in the long run,\nas in tropical countries, engender insalubrious miasmata--this heat, I say, finds itself perfectly tempered\non the side whence it comes, or rather whence it should come--that is to say, the southern side-- by the\n-40\n\nsouth-eastern winds, which, having cooled themselves passing over the Seine, reach us sometimes all at\nonce like breezes from Russia.\"\n\"At any rate, you have some walks in the neighbourhood?\" continued Madame Bovary, speaking to the\nyoung man.\n\"Oh, very few,\" he answered. \"There is a place they call La Pature, on the top of the hill, on the edge of\nthe forest. Sometimes, on Sundays, I go and stay there with a book, watching the sunset.\"\n\"I think there is nothing so admirable as sunsets,\" she resumed; \"but especially by the side of the sea.\"\n\"Oh, I adore the sea!\" said Monsieur Leon.\n\"And then, does it not seem to you,\" continued Madame Bovary, \"that the mind travels more freely on\nthis limitless expanse, the contemplation of which elevates the soul, gives ideas of the infinite, the ideal?\"\n\"It is the same with mountainous landscapes,\" continued Leon. \"A cousin of mine who travelled in\nSwitzerland last year told me that one could not picture to oneself the poetry of the lakes, the charm of the\nwaterfalls, the gigantic effect of the glaciers. One sees pines of incredible size across torrents, cottages\nsuspended over precipices, and, a thousand feet below one, whole valleys when the clouds open. Such\nspectacles must stir to enthusiasm, incline to prayer, to ecstasy; and I no longer marvel at that celebrated\nmusician who, the better to inspire his imagination, was in the habit of playing the piano before some\nimposing site.\"\n\"You play?\" she asked.\n\"No, but I am very fond of music,\" he replied.\n\"Ah! don't you listen to him, Madame Bovary,\" interrupted Homais, bending over his plate. \"That's sheer\nmodesty. Why, my dear fellow, the other day in your room you were singing 'L'Ange Gardien'\nravishingly. I heard you from the laboratory. You gave it like an actor.\"\nLeon, in fact, lodged at the chemist's where he had a small room on the second floor, overlooking the\nPlace. He blushed at the compliment of his landlord, who had already turned to the doctor, and was\nenumerating to him, one after the other, all the principal inhabitants of Yonville. He was telling\nanecdotes, giving information; the fortune of the notary was not known exactly, and \"there was the\nTuvache household,\" who made a good deal of show.\nEmma continued, \"And what music do you prefer?\"\n\"Oh, German music; that which makes you dream.\"\n\"Have you been to the opera?\"\n\"Not yet; but I shall go next year, when I am living at Paris to finish reading for the bar.\"\n\"As I had the honour of putting it to your husband,\" said the chemist, \"with regard to this poor Yanoda\nwho has run away, you will find yourself, thanks to his extravagance, in the possession of one of the most\ncomfortable houses of Yonville. Its greatest convenience for a doctor is a door giving on the Walk, where\none can go in and out unseen. Moreover, it contains everything that is agreeable in a household--a\nlaundry, kitchen with offices, sitting-room, fruit-room, and so on. He was a gay dog, who didn't care\n-41\n\nwhat he spent. At the end of the garden, by the side of the water, he had an arbour built just for the\npurpose of drinking beer in summer; and if madame is fond of gardening she will be able--\"\n\"My wife doesn't care about it,\" said Charles; \"although she has been advised to take exercise, she prefers\nalways sitting in her room reading.\"\n\"Like me,\" replied Leon. \"And indeed, what is better than to sit by one's fireside in the evening with a\nbook, while the wind beats against the window and the lamp is burning?\"\n\"What, indeed?\" she said, fixing her large black eyes wide open upon him.\n\"One thinks of nothing,\" he continued; \"the hours slip by. Motionless we traverse countries we fancy we\nsee, and your thought, blinding with the fiction, playing with the details, follows the outline of the\nadventures. It mingles with the characters, and it seems as if it were yourself palpitating beneath their\ncostumes.\"\n\"That is true! That is true?\" she said.\n\"Has it ever happened to you,\" Leon went on, \"to come across some vague idea of one's own in a book,\nsome dim image that comes back to you from afar, and as the completest expression of your own slightest\nsentiment?\"\n\"I have experienced it,\" she replied.\n\"That is why,\" he said, \"I especially love the poets. I think verse more tender than prose, and that it\nmoves far more easily to tears.\"\n\"Still in the long run it is tiring,\" continued Emma. Now I, on the contrary, adore stories that rush\nbreathlessly along, that frighten one. I detest commonplace heroes and moderate sentiments, such as there\nare in nature.\"\n\"In fact,\" observed the clerk, \"these works, not touching the heart, miss, it seems to me, the true end of\nart. It is so sweet, amid all the disenchantments of life, to be able to dwell in thought upon noble\ncharacters, pure affections, and pictures of happiness. For myself, living here far from the world, this is\nmy one distraction; but Yonville affords so few resources.\"\n\"Like Tostes, no doubt,\" replied Emma; \"and so I always subscribed to a lending library.\"\n\"If madame will do me the honour of making use of it\", said the chemist, who had just caught the last\nwords, \"I have at her disposal a library composed of the best authors, Voltaire, Rousseau, Delille, Walter\nScott, the 'Echo des Feuilletons'; and in addition I receive various periodicals, among them the 'Fanal de\nRouen' daily, having the advantage to be its correspondent for the districts of Buchy, Forges, Neufchatel,\nYonville, and vicinity.\"\nFor two hours and a half they had been at table; for the servant Artemis, carelessly dragging her old list\nslippers over the flags, brought one plate after the other, forgot everything, and constantly left the door of\nthe billiard-room half open, so that it beat against the wall with its hooks.\nUnconsciously, Leon, while talking, had placed his foot on one of the bars of the chair on which Madame\nBovary was sitting. She wore a small blue silk necktie, that kept up like a ruff a gauffered cambric collar,\nand with the movements of her head the lower part of her face gently sunk into the linen or came out from\n-42\n\nit. Thus side by side, while Charles and the chemist chatted, they entered into one of those vague\nconversations where the hazard of all that is said brings you back to the fixed centre of a common\nsympathy. The Paris theatres, titles of novels, new quadrilles, and the world they did not know; Tostes,\nwhere she had lived, and Yonville, where they were; they examined all, talked of everything till to the end\nof dinner.\nWhen coffee was served Felicite went away to get ready the room in the new house, and the guests soon\nraised the siege. Madame Lefrancois was asleep near the cinders, while the stable-boy, lantern in hand,\nwas waiting to show Monsieur and Madame Bovary the way home. Bits of straw stuck in his red hair, and\nhe limped with his left leg. When he had taken in his other hand the cure's umbrella, they started.\nThe town was asleep; the pillars of the market threw great shadows; the earth was all grey as on a\nsummer's night. But as the doctor's house was only some fifty paces from the inn, they had to say\ngood-night almost immediately, and the company dispersed.\nAs soon as she entered the passage, Emma felt the cold of the plaster fall about her shoulders like damp\nlinen. The walls were new and the wooden stairs creaked. In their bedroom, on the first floor, a whitish\nlight passed through the curtainless windows.\nShe could catch glimpses of tree tops, and beyond, the fields, half-drowned in the fog that lay reeking in\nthe moonlight along the course of the river. In the middle of the room, pell-mell, were scattered drawers,\nbottles, curtain-rods, gilt poles, with mattresses on the chairs and basins on the ground--the two men who\nhad brought the furniture had left everything about carelessly.\nThis was the fourth time that she had slept in a strange place.\nThe first was the day of her going to the convent; the second, of her arrival at Tostes; the third, at\nVaubyessard; and this was the fourth. And each one had marked, as it were, the inauguration of a new\nphase in her life. She did not believe that things could present themselves in the same way in different\nplaces, and since the portion of her life lived had been bad, no doubt that which remained to be lived\nwould be better.\nChapter Three\nThe next day, as she was getting up, she saw the clerk on the Place. She had on a dressing-gown. He\nlooked up and bowed. She nodded quickly and reclosed the window.\nLeon waited all day for six o'clock in the evening to come, but on going to the inn, he found no one but\nMonsieur Binet, already at table. The dinner of the evening before had been a considerable event for him;\nhe had never till then talked for two hours consecutively to a \"lady.\" How then had he been able to\nexplain, and in such language, the number of things that he could not have said so well before? He was\nusually shy, and maintained that reserve which partakes at once of modesty and dissimulation.\nAt Yonville he was considered \"well-bred.\" He listened to the arguments of the older people, and did not\nseem hot about politics--a remarkable thing for a young man. Then he had some accomplishments; he\npainted in water-colours, could read the key of G, and readily talked literature after dinner when he did\nnot play cards. Monsieur Homais respected him for his education; Madame Homais liked him for his\ngood-nature, for he often took the little Homais into the garden--little brats who were always dirty, very\nmuch spoilt, and somewhat lymphatic, like their mother. Besides the servant to look after them, they had\nJustin, the chemist's apprentice, a second cousin of Monsieur Homais, who had been taken into the house\nfrom charity, and who was useful at the same time as a servant.\n-43\n\nThe druggist proved the best of neighbours. He gave Madame Bovary information as to the trades-people,\nsent expressly for his own cider merchant, tasted the drink himself, and saw that the casks were properly\nplaced in the cellar; he explained how to set about getting in a supply of butter cheap, and made an\narrangement with Lestiboudois, the sacristan, who, besides his sacerdotal and funeral functions, looked\nafter the principal gardens at Yonville by the hour or the year, according to the taste of the customers.\nThe need of looking after others was not the only thing that urged the chemist to such obsequious\ncordiality; there was a plan underneath it all.\nHe had infringed the law of the 19th Ventose, year xi., article I, which forbade all persons not having a\ndiploma to practise medicine; so that, after certain anonymous denunciations, Homais had been\nsummoned to Rouen to see the procurer of the king in his own private room; the magistrate receiving him\nstanding up, ermine on shoulder and cap on head. It was in the morning, before the court opened. In the\ncorridors one heard the heavy boots of the gendarmes walking past, and like a far-off noise great locks\nthat were shut. The druggist's ears tingled as if he were about to have an apoplectic stroke; he saw the\ndepths of dungeons, his family in tears, his shop sold, all the jars dispersed; and he was obliged to enter a\ncafe and take a glass of rum and seltzer to recover his spirits.\nLittle by little the memory of this reprimand grew fainter, and he continued, as heretofore, to give\nanodyne consultations in his back-parlour. But the mayor resented it, his colleagues were jealous,\neverything was to be feared; gaining over Monsieur Bovary by his attentions was to earn his gratitude,\nand prevent his speaking out later on, should he notice anything. So every morning Homais brought him\n\"the paper,\" and often in the afternoon left his shop for a few moments to have a chat with the Doctor.\nCharles was dull: patients did not come. He remained seated for hours without speaking, went into his\nconsulting room to sleep, or watched his wife sewing. Then for diversion he employed himself at home as\na workman; he even tried to do up the attic with some paint which had been left behind by the painters.\nBut money matters worried him. He had spent so much for repairs at Tostes, for madame's toilette, and\nfor the moving, that the whole dowry, over three thousand crowns, had slipped away in two years.\nThen how many things had been spoilt or lost during their carriage from Tostes to Yonville, without\ncounting the plaster cure, who falling out of the coach at an over-severe jolt, had been dashed into a\nthousand fragments on the pavements of Quincampoix! A pleasanter trouble came to distract him,\nnamely, the pregnancy of his wife. As the time of her confinement approached he cherished her the more.\nIt was another bond of the flesh establishing itself, and, as it were, a continued sentiment of a more\ncomplex union. When from afar he saw her languid walk, and her figure without stays turning softly on\nher hips; when opposite one another he looked at her at his ease, while she took tired poses in her\narmchair, then his happiness knew no bounds; he got up, embraced her, passed his hands over her face,\ncalled her little mamma, wanted to make her dance, and half-laughing, half-crying, uttered all kinds of\ncaressing pleasantries that came into his head. The idea of having begotten a child delighted him. Now he\nwanted nothing. He knew human life from end to end, and he sat down to it with serenity.\nEmma at first felt a great astonishment; then was anxious to be delivered that she might know what it was\nto be a mother. But not being able to spend as much as she would have liked, to have a swing-bassinette\nwith rose silk curtains, and embroidered caps, in a fit of bitterness she gave up looking after the trousseau,\nand ordered the whole of it from a village needlewoman, without choosing or discussing anything. Thus\nshe did not amuse herself with those preparations that stimulate the tenderness of mothers, and so her\naffection was from the very outset, perhaps, to some extent attenuated.\nAs Charles, however, spoke of the boy at every meal, she soon began to think of him more consecutively.\n-44\n\nShe hoped for a son; he would be strong and dark; she would call him George; and this idea of having a\nmale child was like an expected revenge for all her impotence in the past. A man, at least, is free; he may\ntravel over passions and over countries, overcome obstacles, taste of the most far-away pleasures. But a\nwoman is always hampered. At once inert and flexible, she has against her the weakness of the flesh and\nlegal dependence. Her will, like the veil of her bonnet, held by a string, flutters in every wind; there is\nalways some desire that draws her, some conventionality that restrains.\nShe was confined on a Sunday at about six o'clock, as the sun was rising.\n\"It is a girl!\" said Charles.\nShe turned her head away and fainted.\nMadame Homais, as well as Madame Lefrancois of the Lion d'Or, almost immediately came running in to\nembrace her. The chemist, as man of discretion, only offered a few provincial felicitations through the\nhalf-opened door. He wished to see the child and thought it well made.\nWhilst she was getting well she occupied herself much in seeking a name for her daughter. First she went\nover all those that have Italian endings, such as Clara, Louisa, Amanda, Atala; she liked Galsuinde pretty\nwell, and Yseult or Leocadie still better.\nCharles wanted the child to be called after her mother; Emma opposed this. They ran over the calendar\nfrom end to end, and then consulted outsiders.\n\"Monsieur Leon,\" said the chemist, \"with whom I was talking about it the other day, wonders you do not\nchose Madeleine. It is very much in fashion just now.\"\nBut Madame Bovary, senior, cried out loudly against this name of a sinner. As to Monsieur Homais, he\nhad a preference for all those that recalled some great man, an illustrious fact, or a generous idea, and it\nwas on this system that he had baptized his four children. Thus Napoleon represented glory and Franklin\nliberty; Irma was perhaps a concession to romanticism, but Athalie was a homage to the greatest\nmasterpiece of the French stage. For his philosophical convictions did not interfere with his artistic tastes;\nin him the thinker did not stifle the man of sentiment; he could make distinctions, make allowances for\nimagination and fanaticism. In this tragedy, for example, he found fault with the ideas, but admired the\nstyle; he detested the conception, but applauded all the details, and loathed the characters while he grew\nenthusiastic over their dialogue. When he read the fine passages he was transported, but when he thought\nthat mummers would get something out of them for their show, he was disconsolate; and in this confusion\nof sentiments in which he was involved he would have like at once to crown Racine with both his hands\nand discuss with him for a good quarter of an hour.\nAt last Emma remembered that at the chateau of Vaubyessard she had heard the Marchioness call a young\nlady Berthe; from that moment this name was chosen; and as old Rouault could not come, Monsieur\nHomais was requested to stand godfather. His gifts were all products from his establishment, to wit: six\nboxes of jujubes, a whole jar of racahout, three cakes of marshmallow paste, and six sticks of sugar-candy\ninto the bargain that he had come across in a cupboard. On the evening of the ceremony there was a grand\ndinner; the cure was present; there was much excitement. Monsieur Homais towards liqueur-time began\nsinging \"Le Dieu des bonnes gens.\" Monsieur Leon sang a barcarolle, and Madame Bovary, senior, who\nwas godmother, a romance of the time of the Empire; finally, M. Bovary, senior, insisted on having the\nchild brought down, and began baptizing it with a glass of champagne that he poured over its head. This\nmockery of the first of the sacraments made the Abbe Bournisien angry; old Bovary replied by a\nquotation from \"La Guerre des Dieux\"; the cure wanted to leave; the ladies implored, Homais interfered;\n-45\n\nand they succeeded in making the priest sit down again, and he quietly went on with the half-finished\ncoffee in his saucer.\nMonsieur Bovary, senior, stayed at Yonville a month, dazzling the native by a superb policeman's cap\nwith silver tassels that he wore in the morning when he smoked his pipe in the square. Being also in the\nhabit of drinking a good deal of brandy, he often sent the servant to the Lion d'Or to buy him a bottle,\nwhich was put down to his son's account, and to perfume his handkerchiefs he used up his\ndaughter-in-law's whole supply of eau-de-cologne.\nThe latter did not at all dislike his company. He had knocked about the world, he talked about Berlin,\nVienna, and Strasbourg, of his soldier times, of the mistresses he had had, the grand luncheons of which\nhe had partaken; then he was amiable, and sometimes even, either on the stairs, or in the garden, would\nseize hold of her waist, crying, \"Charles, look out for yourself.\"\nThen Madame Bovary, senior, became alarmed for her son's happiness, and fearing that her husband\nmight in the long-run have an immoral influence upon the ideas of the young woman, took care to hurry\ntheir departure. Perhaps she had more serious reasons for uneasiness. Monsieur Bovary was not the man\nto respect anything.\nOne day Emma was suddenly seized with the desire to see her little girl, who had been put to nurse with\nthe carpenter's wife, and, without looking at the calendar to see whether the six weeks of the Virgin were\nyet passed, she set out for the Rollets' house, situated at the extreme end of the village, between the\nhighroad and the fields.\nIt was mid-day, the shutters of the houses were closed and the slate roofs that glittered beneath the fierce\nlight of the blue sky seemed to strike sparks from the crest of the gables. A heavy wind was blowing;\nEmma felt weak as she walked; the stones of the pavement hurt her; she was doubtful whether she would\nnot go home again, or go in somewhere to rest.\nAt this moment Monsieur Leon came out from a neighbouring door with a bundle of papers under his\narm. He came to greet her, and stood in the shade in front of the Lheureux's shop under the projecting\ngrey awning.\nMadame Bovary said she was going to see her baby, but that she was beginning to grow tired.\n\"If--\" said Leon, not daring to go on.\n\"Have you any business to attend to?\" she asked.\nAnd on the clerk's answer, she begged him to accompany her. That same evening this was known in\nYonville, and Madame Tuvache, the mayor's wife, declared in the presence of her servant that \"Madame\nBovary was compromising herself.\"\nTo get to the nurse's it was necessary to turn to the left on leaving the street, as if making for the\ncemetery, and to follow between little houses and yards a small path bordered with privet hedges. They\nwere in bloom, and so were the speedwells, eglantines, thistles, and the sweetbriar that sprang up from the\nthickets. Through openings in the hedges one could see into the huts, some pigs on a dung-heap, or\ntethered cows rubbing their horns against the trunk of trees. The two, side by side walked slowly, she\nleaning upon him, and he restraining his pace, which he regulated by hers; in front of them a swarm of\nmidges fluttered, buzzing in the warm air.\n-46\n\nThe recognized the house by an old walnut-tree which shaded it.\nLow and covered with brown tiles, there hung outside it, beneath the dormer-window of the garret, a\nstring of onions. Faggots upright against a thorn fence surrounded a bed of lettuce, a few square feet of\nlavender, and sweet peas stung on sticks. Dirty water was running here and there on the grass, and all\nround were several indefinite rags, knitted stockings, a red calico jacket, and a large sheet of coarse linen\nspread over the hedge. At the noise of the gate the nurse appeared with a baby she was suckling on one\narm. With her other hand she was pulling along a poor puny little fellow, his face covered with scrofula,\nthe son of a Rouen hosier, whom his parents, too taken up with their business, left in the country.\n\"Go in,\" she said; \"your little one is there asleep.\"\nThe room on the ground-floor, the only one in the dwelling, had at its farther end, against the wall, a large\nbed without curtains, while a kneading-trough took up the side by the window, one pane of which was\nmended with a piece of blue paper. In the corner behind the door, shining hob-nailed shoes stood in a row\nunder the slab of the washstand, near a bottle of oil with a feather stuck in its mouth; a Matthieu\nLaensberg lay on the dusty mantelpiece amid gunflints, candle-ends, and bits of amadou.\nFinally, the last luxury in the apartment was a \"Fame\" blowing her trumpets, a picture cut out, no doubt,\nfrom some perfumer's prospectus and nailed to the wall with six wooden shoe-pegs.\nEmma's child was asleep in a wicker-cradle. She took it up in the wrapping that enveloped it and began\nsinging softly as she rocked herself to and fro.\nLeon walked up and down the room; it seemed strange to him to see this beautiful woman in her nankeen\ndress in the midst of all this poverty. Madam Bovary reddened; he turned away, thinking perhaps there\nhad been an impertinent look in his eyes. Then she put back the little girl, who had just been sick over her\ncollar.\nThe nurse at once came to dry her, protesting that it wouldn't show.\n\"She gives me other doses,\" she said: \"I am always a-washing of her. If you would have the goodness to\norder Camus, the grocer, to let me have a little soap, it would really be more convenient for you, as I\nneedn't trouble you then.\"\n\"Very well! very well!\" said Emma. \"Good morning, Madame Rollet,\" and she went out, wiping her\nshoes at the door.\nThe good woman accompanied her to the end of the garden, talking all the time of the trouble she had\ngetting up of nights.\n\"I'm that worn out sometimes as I drop asleep on my chair. I'm sure you might at least give me just a\npound of ground coffee; that'd last me a month, and I'd take it of a morning with some milk.\"\nAfter having submitted to her thanks, Madam Bovary left. She had gone a little way down the path when,\nat the sound of wooden shoes, she turned round. It was the nurse.\n\"What is it?\"\nThen the peasant woman, taking her aside behind an elm tree, began talking to her of her husband, who\nwith his trade and six francs a year that the captain--\n-47\n\n\"Oh, be quick!\" said Emma.\n\"Well,\" the nurse went on, heaving sighs between each word, \"I'm afraid he'll be put out seeing me have\ncoffee along, you know men--\"\n\"But you are to have some,\" Emma repeated; \"I will give you some. You bother me!\"\n\"Oh, dear! my poor, dear lady! you see in consequence of his wounds he has terrible cramps in the chest.\nHe even says that cider weakens him.\"\n\"Do make haste, Mere Rollet!\"\n\"Well,\" the latter continued, making a curtsey, \"if it weren't asking too much,\" and she curtsied once\nmore, \"if you would\"--and her eyes begged--\"a jar of brandy,\" she said at last, \"and I'd rub your little\none's feet with it; they're as tender as one's tongue.\"\nOnce rid of the nurse, Emma again took Monsieur Leon's arm. She walked fast for some time, then more\nslowly, and looking straight in front of her, her eyes rested on the shoulder of the young man, whose\nfrock-coat had a black-velvety collar. His brown hair fell over it, straight and carefully arranged. She\nnoticed his nails which were longer than one wore them at Yonville. It was one of the clerk's chief\noccupations to trim them, and for this purpose he kept a special knife in his writing desk.\nThey returned to Yonville by the water-side. In the warm season the bank, wider than at other times,\nshowed to their foot the garden walls whence a few steps led to the river. It flowed noiselessly, swift, and\ncold to the eye; long, thin grasses huddled together in it as the current drove them, and spread themselves\nupon the limpid water like streaming hair; sometimes at the tip of the reeds or on the leaf of a water-lily\nan insect with fine legs crawled or rested. The sun pierced with a ray the small blue bubbles of the waves\nthat, breaking, followed each other; branchless old willows mirrored their grey backs in the water;\nbeyond, all around, the meadows seemed empty. It was the dinner-hour at the farms, and the young\nwoman and her companion heard nothing as they walked but the fall of their steps on the earth of the\npath, the words they spoke, and the sound of Emma's dress rustling round her.\nThe walls of the gardens with pieces of bottle on their coping were hot as the glass windows of a\nconservatory. Wallflowers had sprung up between the bricks, and with the tip of her open sunshade\nMadame Bovary, as she passed, made some of their faded flowers crumble into a yellow dust, or a spray\nof overhanging honeysuckle and clematis caught in its fringe and dangled for a moment over the silk.\nThey were talking of a troupe of Spanish dancers who were expected shortly at the Rouen theatre.\n\"Are you going?\" she asked.\n\"If I can,\" he answered.\nHad they nothing else to say to one another? Yet their eyes were full of more serious speech, and while\nthey forced themselves to find trivial phrases, they felt the same languor stealing over them both. It was\nthe whisper of the soul, deep, continuous, dominating that of their voices. Surprised with wonder at this\nstrange sweetness, they did not think of speaking of the sensation or of seeking its cause. Coming joys,\nlike tropical shores, throw over the immensity before them their inborn softness, an odorous wind, and we\nare lulled by this intoxication without a thought of the horizon that we do not even know.\nIn one place the ground had been trodden down by the cattle; they had to step on large green stones put\n-48\n\nhere and there in the mud.\nShe often stopped a moment to look where to place her foot, and tottering on a stone that shook, her arms\noutspread, her form bent forward with a look of indecision, she would laugh, afraid of falling into the\npuddles of water.\nWhen they arrived in front of her garden, Madame Bovary opened the little gate, ran up the steps and\ndisappeared.\nLeon returned to his office. His chief was away; he just glanced at the briefs, then cut himself a pen, and\nat last took up his hat and went out.\nHe went to La Pature at the top of the Argueil hills at the beginning of the forest; he threw himself upon\nthe ground under the pines and watched the sky through his fingers.\n\"How bored I am!\" he said to himself, \"how bored I am!\"\nHe thought he was to be pitied for living in this village, with Homais for a friend and Monsieru\nGuillaumin for master. The latter, entirely absorbed by his business, wearing gold-rimmed spectacles and\nred whiskers over a white cravat, understood nothing of mental refinements, although he affected a stiff\nEnglish manner, which in the beginning had impressed the clerk.\nAs to the chemist's spouse, she was the best wife in Normandy, gentle as a sheep, loving her children, her\nfather, her mother, her cousins, weeping for other's woes, letting everything go in her household, and\ndetesting corsets; but so slow of movement, such a bore to listen to, so common in appearance, and of\nsuch restricted conversation, that although she was thirty, he only twenty, although they slept in rooms\nnext each other and he spoke to her daily, he never thought that she might be a woman for another, or that\nshe possessed anything else of her sex than the gown.\nAnd what else was there? Binet, a few shopkeepers, two or three publicans, the cure, and finally,\nMonsieur Tuvache, the mayor, with his two sons, rich, crabbed, obtuse persons, who farmed their own\nlands and had feasts among themselves, bigoted to boot, and quite unbearable companions.\nBut from the general background of all these human faces Emma's stood out isolated and yet farthest off;\nfor between her and him he seemed to see a vague abyss.\nIn the beginning he had called on her several times along with the druggist. Charles had not appeared\nparticularly anxious to see him again, and Leon did not know what to do between his fear of being\nindiscreet and the desire for an intimacy that seemed almost impossible.\nChapter Four\nWhen the first cold days set in Emma left her bedroom for the sitting-room, a long apartment with a low\nceiling, in which there was on the mantelpiece a large bunch of coral spread out against the looking-glass.\nSeated in her arm chair near the window, she could see the villagers pass along the pavement.\nTwice a day Leon went from his office to the Lion d'Or. Emma could hear him coming from afar; she\nleant forward listening, and the young man glided past the curtain, always dressed in the same way, and\nwithout turning his head. But in the twilight, when, her chin resting on her left hand, she let the\nembroidery she had begun fall on her knees, she often shuddered at the apparition of this shadow\nsuddenly gliding past. She would get up and order the table to be laid.\n-49\n\nMonsieur Homais called at dinner-time. Skull-cap in hand, he came in on tiptoe, in order to disturb no\none, always repeating the same phrase, \"Good evening, everybody.\" Then, when he had taken his seat at\nthe table between the pair, he asked the doctor about his patients, and the latter consulted his as to the\nprobability of their payment. Next they talked of \"what was in the paper.\"\nHomais by this hour knew it almost by heart, and he repeated it from end to end, with the reflections of\nthe penny-a-liners, and all the stories of individual catastrophes that had occurred in France or abroad.\nBut the subject becoming exhausted, he was not slow in throwing out some remarks on the dishes before\nhim.\nSometimes even, half-rising, he delicately pointed out to madame the tenderest morsel, or turning to the\nservant, gave her some advice on the manipulation of stews and the hygiene of seasoning.\nHe talked aroma, osmazome, juices, and gelatine in a bewildering manner. Moreover, Homais, with his\nhead fuller of recipes than his shop of jars, excelled in making all kinds of preserves, vinegars, and sweet\nliqueurs; he knew also all the latest inventions in economic stoves, together with the art of preserving\ncheese and of curing sick wines.\nAt eight o'clock Justin came to fetch him to shut up the shop.\nThen Monsieur Homais gave him a sly look, especially if Felicite was there, for he half noticed that his\napprentice was fond of the doctor's house.\n\"The young dog,\" he said, \"is beginning to have ideas, and the devil take me if I don't believe he's in love\nwith your servant!\"\nBut a more serious fault with which he reproached Justin was his constantly listening to conversation. On\nSunday, for example, one could not get him out of the drawing-room, whither Madame Homais had\ncalled him to fetch the children, who were falling asleep in the arm-chairs, and dragging down with their\nbacks calico chair-covers that were too large.\nNot many people came to these soirees at the chemist's, his scandal-mongering and political opinions\nhaving successfully alienated various respectable persons from him. The clerk never failed to be there. As\nsoon as he heard the bell he ran to meet Madame Bovary, took her shawl, and put away under the\nshop-counter the thick list shoes that she wore over her boots when there was snow.\nFirst they played some hands at trente-et-un; next Monsieur Homais played ecarte with Emma; Leon\nbehind her gave her advice.\nStanding up with his hands on the back of her chair he saw the teeth of her comb that bit into her chignon.\nWith every movement that she made to throw her cards the right side of her dress was drawn up. From\nher turned-up hair a dark colour fell over her back, and growing gradually paler, lost itself little by little in\nthe shade. Then her dress fell on both sides of her chair, puffing out full of folds, and reached the ground.\nWhen Leon occasionally felt the sole of his boot resting on it, he drew back as if he had trodden upon\nsome one.\nWhen the game of cards was over, the druggist and the Doctor played dominoes, and Emma, changing her\nplace, leant her elbow on the table, turning over the leaves of \"L'Illustration\". She had brought her ladies'\njournal with her. Leon sat down near her; they looked at the engravings together, and waited for one\nanother at the bottom of the pages. She often begged him to read her the verses; Leon declaimed them in a\nlanguid voice, to which he carefully gave a dying fall in the love passages. But the noise of the dominoes\n-50\n\nannoyed him. Monsieur Homais was strong at the game; he could beat Charles and give him a double-six.\nThen the three hundred finished, they both stretched themselves out in front of the fire, and were soon\nasleep. The fire was dying out in the cinders; the teapot was empty, Leon was still reading.\nEmma listened to him, mechanically turning around the lampshade, on the gauze of which were painted\nclowns in carriages, and tight-rope dances with their balancing-poles. Leon stopped, pointing with a\ngesture to his sleeping audience; then they talked in low tones, and their conversation seemed the more\nsweet to them because it was unheard.\nThus a kind of bond was established between them, a constant commerce of books and of romances.\nMonsieur Bovary, little given to jealousy, did not trouble himself about it.\nOn his birthday he received a beautiful phrenological head, all marked with figures to the thorax and\npainted blue. This was an attention of the clerk's. He showed him many others, even to doing errands for\nhim at Rouen; and the book of a novelist having made the mania for cactuses fashionable, Leon bought\nsome for Madame Bovary, bringing them back on his knees in the \"Hirondelle,\" pricking his fingers on\ntheir hard hairs.\nShe had a board with a balustrade fixed against her window to hold the pots. The clerk, too, had his small\nhanging garden; they saw each other tending their flowers at their windows.\nOf the windows of the village there was one yet more often occupied; for on Sundays from morning to\nnight, and every morning when the weather was bright, one could see at the dormer-window of the garret\nthe profile of Monsieur Binet bending over his lathe, whose monotonous humming could be heard at the\nLion d'Or.\nOne evening on coming home Leon found in his room a rug in velvet and wool with leaves on a pale\nground. He called Madame Homais, Monsieur Homais, Justin, the children, the cook; he spoke of it to his\nchief; every one wanted to see this rug. Why did the doctor's wife give the clerk presents? It looked\nqueer. They decided that she must be his lover.\nHe made this seem likely, so ceaselessly did he talk of her charms and of her wit; so much so, that Binet\nonce roughly answered him--\n\"What does it matter to me since I'm not in her set?\"\nHe tortured himself to find out how he could make his declaration to her, and always halting between the\nfear of displeasing her and the shame of being such a coward, he wept with discouragement and desire.\nThen he took energetic resolutions, wrote letters that he tore up, put it off to times that he again deferred.\nOften he set out with the determination to dare all; but this resolution soon deserted him in Emma's\npresence, and when Charles, dropping in, invited him to jump into his chaise to go with him to see some\npatient in the neighbourhood, he at once accepted, bowed to madame, and went out. Her husband, was he\nnot something belonging to her? As to Emma, she did not ask herself whether she loved. Love, she\nthought, must come suddenly, with great outbursts and lightnings--a hurricane of the skies, which falls\nupon life, revolutionises it, roots up the will like a leaf, and sweeps the whole heart into the abyss. She did\nnot know that on the terrace of houses it makes lakes when the pipes are choked, and she would thus have\nremained in her security when she suddenly discovered a rent in the wall of it.\nChapter Five\nIt was a Sunday in February, an afternoon when the snow was falling.\n-51\n\nThey had all, Monsieur and Madame Bovary, Homais, and Monsieur Leon, gone to see a yarn-mill that\nwas being built in the valley a mile and a half from Yonville. The druggist had taken Napoleon and\nAthalie to give them some exercise, and Justin accompanied them, carrying the umbrellas on his shoulder.\nNothing, however, could be less curious than this curiosity. A great piece of waste ground, on which\npell-mell, amid a mass of sand and stones, were a few break-wheels, already rusty, surrounded by a\nquadrangular building pierced by a number of little windows. The building was unfinished; the sky could\nbe seen through the joists of the roofing. Attached to the stop-plank of the gable a bunch of straw mixed\nwith corn-ears fluttered its tricoloured ribbons in the wind.\nHomais was talking. He explained to the company the future importance of this establishment, computed\nthe strength of the floorings, the thickness of the walls, and regretted extremely not having a yard-stick\nsuch as Monsieur Binet possessed for his own special use.\nEmma, who had taken his arm, bent lightly against his shoulder, and she looked at the sun's disc shedding\nafar through the mist his pale splendour. She turned. Charles was there. His cap was drawn down over his\neyebrows, and his two thick lips were trembling, which added a look of stupidity to his face; his very\nback, his calm back, was irritating to behold, and she saw written upon his coat all the platitude of the\nbearer.\nWhile she was considering him thus, tasting in her irritation a sort of depraved pleasure, Leon made a step\nforward. The cold that made him pale seemed to add a more gentle languor to his face; between his cravat\nand his neck the somewhat loose collar of his shirt showed the skin; the lobe of his ear looked out from\nbeneath a lock of hair, and his large blue eyes, raised to the clouds, seemed to Emma more limpid and\nmore beautiful than those mountain-lakes where the heavens are mirrored.\n\"Wretched boy!\" suddenly cried the chemist.\nAnd he ran to his son, who had just precipitated himself into a heap of lime in order to whiten his boots.\nAt the reproaches with which he was being overwhelmed Napoleon began to roar, while Justin dried his\nshoes with a wisp of straw. But a knife was wanted; Charles offered his.\n\"Ah!\" she said to herself, \"he carried a knife in his pocket like a peasant.\"\nThe hoar-frost was falling, and they turned back to Yonville.\nIn the evening Madame Bovary did not go to her neighbour's, and when Charles had left and she felt\nherself alone, the comparison re-began with the clearness of a sensation almost actual, and with that\nlengthening of perspective which memory gives to things. Looking from her bed at the clean fire that was\nburning, she still saw, as she had down there, Leon standing up with one hand behind his cane, and with\nthe other holding Athalie, who was quietly sucking a piece of ice. She thought him charming; she could\nnot tear herself away from him; she recalled his other attitudes on other days, the words he had spoken,\nthe sound of his voice, his whole person; and she repeated, pouting out her lips as if for a kiss--\n\"Yes, charming! charming! Is he not in love?\" she asked herself; \"but with whom? With me?\"\nAll the proofs arose before her at once; her heart leapt. The flame of the fire threw a joyous light upon the\nceiling; she turned on her back, stretching out her arms.\nThen began the eternal lamentation: \"Oh, if Heaven had out willed it! And why not? What prevented it?\"\n-52\n\nWhen Charles came home at midnight, she seemed to have just awakened, and as he made a noise\nundressing, she complained of a headache, then asked carelessly what had happened that evening.\n\"Monsieur Leon,\" he said, \"went to his room early.\"\nShe could not help smiling, and she fell asleep, her soul filled with a new delight.\nThe next day, at dusk, she received a visit from Monsieur Lherueux, the draper. He was a man of ability,\nwas this shopkeeper. Born a Gascon but bred a Norman, he grafted upon his southern volubility the\ncunning of the Cauchois. His fat, flabby, beardless face seemed dyed by a decoction of liquorice, and his\nwhite hair made even more vivid the keen brilliance of his small black eyes. No one knew what he had\nbeen formerly; a pedlar said some, a banker at Routot according to others. What was certain was that he\nmade complex calculations in his head that would have frightened Binet himself. Polite to\nobsequiousness, he always held himself with his back bent in the position of one who bows or who\ninvites.\nAfter leaving at the door his hat surrounded with crape, he put down a green bandbox on the table, and\nbegan by complaining to madame, with many civilities, that he should have remained till that day without\ngaining her confidence. A poor shop like his was not made to attract a \"fashionable lady\"; he emphasized\nthe words; yet she had only to command, and he would undertake to provide her with anything she might\nwish, either in haberdashery or linen, millinery or fancy goods, for he went to town regularly four times a\nmonth. He was connected with the best houses. You could speak of him at the \"Trois Freres,\" at the\n\"Barbe d'Or,\" or at the \"Grand Sauvage\"; all these gentlemen knew him as well as the insides of their\npockets. To-day, then he had come to show madame, in passing, various articles he happened to have,\nthanks to the most rare opportunity. And he pulled out half-a-dozen embroidered collars from the box.\nMadame Bovary examined them. \"I do not require anything,\" she said.\nThen Monsieur Lheureux delicately exhibited three Algerian scarves, several packet of English needles, a\npair of straw slippers, and finally, four eggcups in cocoanut wood, carved in open work by convicts.\nThen, with both hands on the table, his neck stretched out, his figure bent forward, open-mouthed, he\nwatched Emma's look, who was walking up and down undecided amid these goods. From time to time, as\nif to remove some dust, he filliped with his nail the silk of the scarves spread out at full length, and they\nrustled with a little noise, making in the green twilight the gold spangles of their tissue scintillate like\nlittle stars.\n\"How much are they?\"\n\"A mere nothing,\" he replied, \"a mere nothing. But there's no hurry; whenever it's convenient. We are\nnot Jews.\"\nShe reflected for a few moments, and ended by again declining Monsieur Lheureux's offer. He replied\nquite unconcernedly--\n\"Very well. We shall understand one another by and by. I have always got on with ladies--if I didn't with\nmy own!\"\nEmma smiled.\n\"I wanted to tell you,\" he went on good-naturedly, after his joke, \"that it isn't the money I should trouble\nabout. Why, I could give you some, if need be.\"\n-53\n\nShe made a gesture of surprise.\n\"Ah!\" said he quickly and in a low voice, \"I shouldn't have to go far to find you some, rely on that.\"\nAnd he began asking after Pere Tellier, the proprietor of the \"Cafe Francais,\" whom Monsieur Bovary\nwas then attending.\n\"What's the matter with Pere Tellier? He coughs so that he shakes his whole house, and I'm afraid he'll\nsoon want a deal covering rather than a flannel vest. He was such a rake as a young man! Those sort of\npeople, madame, have not the least regularity; he's burnt up with brandy. Still it's sad, all the same, to see\nan acquaintance go off.\"\nAnd while he fastened up his box he discoursed about the doctor's patients.\n\"It's the weather, no doubt,\" he said, looking frowningly at the floor, \"that causes these illnesses. I, too,\ndon't feel the thing. One of these days I shall even have to consult the doctor for a pain I have in my back.\nWell, good-bye, Madame Bovary. At your service; your very humble servant.\" And he closed the door\ngently.\nEmma had her dinner served in her bedroom on a tray by the fireside; she was a long time over it;\neverything was well with her.\n\"How good I was!\" she said to herself, thinking of the scarves.\nShe heard some steps on the stairs. It was Leon. She got up and took from the chest of drawers the first\npile of dusters to be hemmed. When he came in she seemed very busy.\nThe conversation languished; Madame Bovary gave it up every few minutes, whilst he himself seemed\nquite embarrassed. Seated on a low chair near the fire, he turned round in his fingers the ivory\nthimble-case. She stitched on, or from time to time turned down the hem of the cloth with her nail. She\ndid not speak; he was silent, captivated by her silence, as he would have been by her speech.\n\"Poor fellow!\" she thought.\n\"How have I displeased her?\" he asked himself.\nAt last, however, Leon said that he should have, one of these days, to go to Rouen on some office\nbusiness.\n\"Your music subscription is out; am I to renew it?\"\n\"No,\" she replied.\n\"Why?\"\n\"Because--\"\nAnd pursing her lips she slowly drew a long stitch of grey thread.\nThis work irritated Leon. It seemed to roughen the ends of her fingers. A gallant phrase came into his\nhead, but he did not risk it.\n-54\n\n\"Then you are giving it up?\" he went on.\n\"What?\" she asked hurriedly. \"Music? Ah! yes! Have I not my house to look after, my husband to attend\nto, a thousand things, in fact, many duties that must be considered first?\"\nShe looked at the clock. Charles was late. Then, she affected anxiety. Two or three times she even\nrepeated, \"He is so good!\"\nThe clerk was fond of Monsieur Bovary. But this tenderness on his behalf astonished him unpleasantly;\nnevertheless he took up on his praises, which he said everyone was singing, especially the chemist.\n\"Ah! he is a good fellow,\" continued Emma.\n\"Certainly,\" replied the clerk.\nAnd he began talking of Madame Homais, whose very untidy appearance generally made them laugh.\n\"What does it matter?\" interrupted Emma. \"A good housewife does not trouble about her appearance.\"\nThen she relapsed into silence.\nIt was the same on the following days; her talks, her manners, everything changed. She took interest in\nthe housework, went to church regularly, and looked after her servant with more severity.\nShe took Berthe from nurse. When visitors called, Felicite brought her in, and Madame Bovary undressed\nher to show off her limbs. She declared she adored children; this was her consolation, her joy, her\npassion, and she accompanied her caresses with lyrical outburst which would have reminded anyone but\nthe Yonville people of Sachette in \"Notre Dame de Paris.\"\nWhen Charles came home he found his slippers put to warm near the fire. His waistcoat now never\nwanted lining, nor his shirt buttons, and it was quite a pleasure to see in the cupboard the night-caps\narranged in piles of the same height. She no longer grumbled as formerly at taking a turn in the garden;\nwhat he proposed was always done, although she did not understand the wishes to which she submitted\nwithout a murmur; and when Leon saw him by his fireside after dinner, his two hands on his stomach, his\ntwo feet on the fender, his two cheeks red with feeding, his eyes moist with happiness, the child crawling\nalong the carpet, and this woman with the slender waist who came behind his arm-chair to kiss his\nforehead: \"What madness!\" he said to himself. \"And how to reach her!\"\nAnd thus she seemed so virtuous and inaccessible to him that he lost all hope, even the faintest. But by\nthis renunciation he placed her on an extraordinary pinnacle. To him she stood outside those fleshly\nattributes from which he had nothing to obtain, and in his heart she rose ever, and became farther\nremoved from him after the magnificent manner of an apotheosis that is taking wing. It was one of those\npure feelings that do not interfere with life, that are cultivated because they are rare, and whose loss\nwould afflict more than their passion rejoices.\nEmma grew thinner, her cheeks paler, her face longer. With her black hair, her large eyes, her aquiline\nnose, her birdlike walk, and always silent now, did she not seem to be passing through life scarcely\ntouching it, and to bear on her brow the vague impress of some divine destiny? She was so sad and so\ncalm, at once so gentle and so reserved, that near her one felt oneself seized by an icy charm, as we\nshudder in churches at the perfume of the flowers mingling with the cold of the marble. The others even\ndid not escape from this seduction. The chemist said--\n-55\n\n\"She is a woman of great parts, who wouldn't be misplaced in a sub-prefecture.\"\nThe housewives admired her economy, the patients her politeness, the poor her charity.\nBut she was eaten up with desires, with rage, with hate. That dress with the narrow folds hid a distracted\nfear, of whose torment those chaste lips said nothing. She was in love with Leon, and sought solitude that\nshe might with the more ease delight in his image. The sight of his form troubled the voluptuousness of\nthis mediation. Emma thrilled at the sound of his step; then in his presence the emotion subsided, and\nafterwards there remained to her only an immense astonishment that ended in sorrow.\nLeon did not know that when he left her in despair she rose after he had gone to see him in the street. She\nconcerned herself about his comings and goings; she watched his face; she invented quite a history to find\nan excuse for going to his room. The chemist's wife seemed happy to her to sleep under the same roof,\nand her thoughts constantly centered upon this house, like the \"Lion d'Or\" pigeons, who came there to\ndip their red feet and white wings in its gutters. But the more Emma recognised her love, the more she\ncrushed it down, that it might not be evident, that she might make it less. She would have liked Leon to\nguess it, and she imagined chances, catastrophes that should facilitate this.\nWhat restrained her was, no doubt, idleness and fear, and a sense of shame also. She thought she had\nrepulsed him too much, that the time was past, that all was lost. Then, pride, and joy of being able to say\nto herself, \"I am virtuous,\" and to look at herself in the glass taking resigned poses, consoled her a little\nfor the sacrifice she believed she was making.\nThen the lusts of the flesh, the longing for money, and the melancholy of passion all blended themselves\ninto one suffering, and instead of turning her thoughts from it, she clave to it the more, urging herself to\npain, and seeking everywhere occasion for it. She was irritated by an ill-served dish or by a half-open\ndoor; bewailed the velvets she had not, the happiness she had missed, her too exalted dreams, her narrow\nhome.\nWhat exasperated her was that Charles did not seem to notice her anguish. His conviction that he was\nmaking her happy seemed to her an imbecile insult, and his sureness on this point ingratitude. For whose\nsake, then was she virtuous? Was it not for him, the obstacle to all felicity, the cause of all misery, and, as\nit were, the sharp clasp of that complex strap that bucked her in on all sides.\nOn him alone, then, she concentrated all the various hatreds that resulted from her boredom, and every\neffort to diminish only augmented it; for this useless trouble was added to the other reasons for despair,\nand contributed still more to the separation between them. Her own gentleness to herself made her rebel\nagainst him. Domestic mediocrity drove her to lewd fancies, marriage tenderness to adulterous desires.\nShe would have like Charles to beat her, that she might have a better right to hate him, to revenge herself\nupon him. She was surprised sometimes at the atrocious conjectures that came into her thoughts, and she\nhad to go on smiling, to hear repeated to her at all hours that she was happy, to pretend to be happy, to let\nit be believed.\nYet she had loathing of this hypocrisy. She was seized with the temptation to flee somewhere with Leon\nto try a new life; but at once a vague chasm full of darkness opened within her soul.\n\"Besides, he no longer loves me,\" she thought. \"What is to become of me? What help is to be hoped for,\nwhat consolation, what solace?\"\nShe was left broken, breathless, inert, sobbing in a low voice, with flowing tears.\n-56\n\n\"Why don't you tell master?\" the servant asked her when she came in during these crises.\n\"It is the nerves,\" said Emma. \"Do not speak to him of it; it would worry him.\"\n\"Ah! yes,\" Felicite went on, \"you are just like La Guerine, Pere Guerin's daughter, the fisherman at\nPollet, that I used to know at Dieppe before I came to you. She was so sad, so sad, to see her standing\nupright on the threshold of her house, she seemed to you like a winding-sheet spread out before the door.\nHer illness, it appears, was a kind of fog that she had in her head, and the doctors could not do anything,\nnor the priest either. When she was taken too bad she went off quite alone to the sea-shore, so that the\ncustoms officer, going his rounds, often found her lying flat on her face, crying on the shingle. Then, after\nher marriage, it went off, they say.\"\n\"But with me,\" replied Emma, \"it was after marriage that it began.\"\nChapter Six\nOne evening when the window was open, and she, sitting by it, had been watching Lestiboudois, the\nbeadle, trimming the box, she suddenly heard the Angelus ringing.\nIt was the beginning of April, when the primroses are in bloom, and a warm wind blows over the\nflower-beds newly turned, and the gardens, like women, seem to be getting ready for the summer fetes.\nThrough the bars of the arbour and away beyond, the river seen in the fields, meandering through the\ngrass in wandering curves. The evening vapours rose between the leafless poplars, touching their outlines\nwith a violet tint, paler and more transparent than a subtle gauze caught athwart their branches. In the\ndistance cattle moved about; neither their steps nor their lowing could be heard; and the bell, still ringing\nthrough the air, kept up its peaceful lamentation.\nWith this repeated tinkling the thoughts of the young woman lost themselves in old memories of her\nyouth and school-days. She remembered the great candlesticks that rose above the vases full of flowers on\nthe altar, and the tabernacle with its small columns. She would have liked to be once more lost in the long\nline of white veils, marked off here and there by the stuff black hoods of the good sisters bending over\ntheir prie-Dieu. At mass on Sundays, when she looked up, she saw the gentle face of the Virgin amid the\nblue smoke of the rising incense. Then she was moved; she felt herself weak and quite deserted, like the\ndown of a bird whirled by the tempest, and it was unconsciously that she went towards the church,\nincluded to no matter what devotions, so that her soul was absorbed and all existence lost in it.\nOn the Place she met Lestivoudois on his way back, for, in order not to shorten his day's labour, he\npreferred interrupting his work, then beginning it again, so that he rang the Angelus to suit his own\nconvenience. Besides, the ringing over a little earlier warned the lads of catechism hour.\nAlready a few who had arrived were playing marbles on the stones of the cemetery. Others, astride the\nwall, swung their legs, kicking with their clogs the large nettles growing between the little enclosure and\nthe newest graves. This was the only green spot. All the rest was but stones, always covered with a fine\npowder, despite the vestry-broom.\nThe children in list shoes ran about there as if it were an enclosure made for them. The shouts of their\nvoices could be heard through the humming of the bell. This grew less and less with the swinging of the\ngreat rope that, hanging from the top of the belfry, dragged its end on the ground. Swallows flitted to and\nfro uttering little cries, cut the air with the edge of their wings, and swiftly returned to their yellow nests\nunder the tiles of the coping. At the end of the church a lamp was burning, the wick of a night-light in a\nglass hung up. Its light from a distance looked like a white stain trembling in the oil. A long ray of the sun\nfell across the nave and seemed to darken the lower sides and the corners.\n-57\n\n\"Where is the cure?\" asked Madame Bovary of one of the lads, who was amusing himself by shaking a\nswivel in a hole too large for it.\n\"He is just coming,\" he answered.\nAnd in fact the door of the presbytery grated; Abbe Bournisien appeared; the children, pell-mell, fled into\nthe church.\n\"These young scamps!\" murmured the priest, \"always the same!\"\nThen, picking up a catechism all in rags that he had struck with is foot, \"They respect nothing!\" But as\nsoon as he caught sight of Madame Bovary, \"Excuse me,\" he said; \"I did not recognise you.\"\nHe thrust the catechism into his pocket, and stopped short, balancing the heavy vestry key between his\ntwo fingers.\nThe light of the setting sun that fell full upon his face paled the lasting of his cassock, shiny at the elbows,\nunravelled at the hem. Grease and tobacco stains followed along his broad chest the lines of the buttons,\nand grew more numerous the farther they were from his neckcloth, in which the massive folds of his red\nchin rested; this was dotted with yellow spots, that disappeared beneath the coarse hair of his greyish\nbeard. He had just dined and was breathing noisily.\n\"How are you?\" he added.\n\"Not well,\" replied Emma; \"I am ill.\"\n\"Well, and so am I,\" answered the priest. \"These first warm days weaken one most remarkably, don't\nthey? But, after all, we are born to suffer, as St. Paul says. But what does Monsieur Bovary think of it?\"\n\"He!\" she said with a gesture of contempt.\n\"What!\" replied the good fellow, quite astonished, doesn't he prescribe something for you?\"\n\"Ah!\" said Emma, \"it is no earthly remedy I need.\"\nBut the cure from time to time looked into the church, where the kneeling boys were shouldering one\nanother, and tumbling over like packs of cards.\n\"I should like to know--\" she went on.\n\"You look out, Riboudet,\" cried the priest in an angry voice; \"I'll warm your ears, you imp!\" Then\nturning to Emma, \"He's Boudet the carpenter's son; his parents are well off, and let him do just as he\npleases. Yet he could learn quickly if he would, for he is very sharp. And so sometimes for a joke I call\nhim Riboudet (like the road one takes to go to Maromme) and I even say 'Mon Riboudet.' Ha! Ha! 'Mont\nRiboudet.' The other day I repeated that just to Monsignor, and he laughed at it; he condescended to\nlaugh at it. And how is Monsieur Bovary?\"\nShe seemed not to hear him. And he went on--\n\"Always very busy, no doubt; for he and I are certainly the busiest people in the parish. But he is doctor\nof the body,\" he added with a thick laugh, \"and I of the soul.\"\n-58\n\nShe fixed her pleading eyes upon the priest. \"Yes,\" she said, \"you solace all sorrows.\"\n\"Ah! don't talk to me of it, Madame Bovary. This morning I had to go to Bas-Diauville for a cow that\nwas ill; they thought it was under a spell. All their cows, I don't know how it is--But pardon me!\nLonguemarre and Boudet! Bless me! Will you leave off?\"\nAnd with a bound he ran into the church.\nThe boys were just then clustering round the large desk, climbing over the precentor's footstool, opening\nthe missal; and others on tiptoe were just about to venture into the confessional. But the priest suddenly\ndistributed a shower of cuffs among them. Seizing them by the collars of their coats, he lifted them from\nthe ground, and deposited them on their knees on the stones of the choir, firmly, as if he meant planting\nthem there.\n\"Yes,\" said he, when he returned to Emma, unfolding his large cotton handkerchief, one corner of which\nhe put between his teeth, \"farmers are much to be pitied.\"\n\"Others, too,\" she replied.\n\"Assuredly. Town-labourers, for example.\"\n\"It is not they--\"\n\"Pardon! I've there known poor mothers of families, virtuous women, I assure you, real saints, who\nwanted even bread.\"\n\"But those,\" replied Emma, and the corners of her mouth twitched as she spoke, \"those, Monsieur le\nCure, who have bread and have no--\"\n\"Fire in the winter,\" said the priest.\n\"Oh, what does that matter?\"\n\"What! What does it matter? It seems to me that when one has firing and food--for, after all--\"\n\"My God! my God!\" she sighed.\n\"It is indigestion, no doubt? You must get home, Madame Bovary; drink a little tea, that will strengthen\nyou, or else a glass of fresh water with a little moist sugar.\"\n\"Why?\" And she looked like one awaking from a dream.\n\"Well, you see, you were putting your hand to your forehead. I thought you felt faint.\" Then, bethinking\nhimself, \"But you were asking me something? What was it? I really don't remember.\"\n\"I? Nothing! nothing!\" repeated Emma.\nAnd the glance she cast round her slowly fell upon the old man in the cassock. They looked at one\nanother face to face without speaking.\n\"Then, Madame Bovary,\" he said at last, \"excuse me, but duty first, you know; I must look after my\n-59\n\ngood-for-nothings. The first communion will soon be upon us, and I fear we shall be behind after all. So\nafter Ascension Day I keep them recta[11] an extra hour every Wednesday. Poor children! One cannot\nlead them too soon into the path of the Lord, as, moreover, he has himself recommended us to do by the\nmouth of his Divine Son. Good health to you, madame; my respects to your husband.\"\n[11]On the straight and narrow path.\nAnd he went into the church making a genuflexion as soon as he reached the door.\nEmma saw him disappear between the double row of forms, walking with a heavy tread, his head a little\nbent over his shoulder, and with his two hands half-open behind him.\nThen she turned on her heel all of one piece, like a statue on a pivot, and went homewards. But the loud\nvoice of the priest, the clear voices of the boys still reached her ears, and went on behind her.\n\"Are you a Christian?\"\n\"Yes, I am a Christian.\"\n\"What is a Christian?\"\n\"He who, being baptized-baptized-baptized--\"\nShe went up the steps of the staircase holding on to the banisters, and when she was in her room threw\nherself into an arm-chair.\nThe whitish light of the window-panes fell with soft undulations.\nThe furniture in its place seemed to have become more immobile, and to lose itself in the shadow as in an\nocean of darkness. The fire was out, the clock went on ticking, and Emma vaguely marvelled at this calm\nof all things while within herself was such tumult. But little Berthe was there, between the window and\nthe work-table, tottering on her knitted shoes, and trying to come to her mother to catch hold of the ends\nof her apron-strings.\n\"Leave me alone,\" said the latter, putting her from her with her hand.\nThe little girl soon came up closer against her knees, and leaning on them with her arms, she looked up\nwith her large blue eyes, while a small thread of pure saliva dribbled from her lips on to the silk apron.\n\"Leave me alone,\" repeated the young woman quite irritably.\nHer face frightened the child, who began to scream.\n\"Will you leave me alone?\" she said, pushing her with her elbow.\nBerthe fell at the foot of the drawers against the brass handle, cutting her cheek, which began to bleed,\nagainst it. Madame Bovary sprang to lift her up, broke the bell-rope, called for the servant with all her\nmight, and she was just going to curse herself when Charles appeared. It was the dinner-hour; he had\ncome home.\n\"Look, dear!\" said Emma, in a calm voice, \"the little one fell down while she was playing, and has hurt\n-60\n\nherself.\"\nCharles reassured her; the case was not a serious one, and he went for some sticking plaster.\nMadame Bovary did not go downstairs to the dining-room; she wished to remain alone to look after the\nchild. Then watching her sleep, the little anxiety she felt gradually wore off, and she seemed very stupid\nto herself, and very good to have been so worried just now at so little. Berthe, in fact, no longer sobbed.\nHer breathing now imperceptibly raised the cotton covering. Big tears lay in the corner of the half-closed\neyelids, through whose lashes one could see two pale sunken pupils; the plaster stuck on her cheek drew\nthe skin obliquely.\n\"It is very strange,\" thought Emma, \"how ugly this child is!\"\nWhen at eleven o'clock Charles came back from the chemist's shop, whither he had gone after dinner to\nreturn the remainder of the sticking-plaster, he found his wife standing by the cradle.\n\"I assure you it's nothing.\" he said, kissing her on the forehead. \"Don't worry, my poor darling; you will\nmake yourself ill.\"\nHe had stayed a long time at the chemist's. Although he had not seemed much moved, Homais,\nnevertheless, had exerted himself to buoy him up, to \"keep up his spirits.\" Then they had talked of the\nvarious dangers that threaten childhood, of the carelessness of servants. Madame Homais knew something\nof it, having still upon her chest the marks left by a basin full of soup that a cook had formerly dropped on\nher pinafore, and her good parents took no end of trouble for her. The knives were not sharpened, nor the\nfloors waxed; there were iron gratings to the windows and strong bars across the fireplace; the little\nHomais, in spite of their spirit, could not stir without someone watching them; at the slightest cold their\nfather stuffed them with pectorals; and until they were turned four they all, without pity, had to wear\nwadded head-protectors. This, it is true, was a fancy of Madame Homais'; her husband was inwardly\nafflicted at it. Fearing the possible consequences of such compression to the intellectual organs. He even\nwent so far as to say to her, \"Do you want to make Caribs or Botocudos of them?\"\nCharles, however, had several times tried to interrupt the conversation. \"I should like to speak to you,\" he\nhad whispered in the clerk's ear, who went upstairs in front of him.\n\"Can he suspect anything?\" Leon asked himself. His heart beat, and he racked his brain with surmises.\nAt last, Charles, having shut the door, asked him to see himself what would be the price at Rouen of a fine\ndaguerreotypes. It was a sentimental surprise he intended for his wife, a delicate attention--his portrait in\na frock-coat. But he wanted first to know \"how much it would be.\" The inquiries would not put Monsieur\nLeon out, since he went to town almost every week.\nWhy? Monsieur Homais suspected some \"young man's affair\" at the bottom of it, an intrigue. But he was\nmistaken. Leon was after no love-making. He was sadder than ever, as Madame Lefrancois saw from the\namount of food he left on his plate. To find out more about it she questioned the tax-collector. Binet\nanswered roughly that he \"wasn't paid by the police.\"\nAll the same, his companion seemed very strange to him, for Leon often threw himself back in his chair,\nand stretching out his arms. Complained vaguely of life.\n\"It's because you don't take enough recreation,\" said the collector.\n-61\n\n\"What recreation?\"\n\"If I were you I'd have a lathe.\"\n\"But I don't know how to turn,\" answered the clerk.\n\"Ah! that's true,\" said the other, rubbing his chin with an air of mingled contempt and satisfaction.\nLeon was weary of loving without any result; moreover he was beginning to feel that depression caused\nby the repetition of the same kind of life, when no interest inspires and no hope sustains it. He was so\nbored with Yonville and its inhabitants, that the sight of certain persons, of certain houses, irritated him\nbeyond endurance; and the chemist, good fellow though he was, was becoming absolutely unbearable to\nhim. Yet the prospect of a new condition of life frightened as much as it seduced him.\nThis apprehension soon changed into impatience, and then Paris from afar sounded its fanfare of masked\nballs with the laugh of grisettes. As he was to finish reading there, why not set out at once? What\nprevented him? And he began making home-preparations; he arranged his occupations beforehand. He\nfurnished in his head an apartment. He would lead an artist's life there! He would take lessons on the\nguitar! He would have a dressing-gown, a Basque cap, blue velvet slippers! He even already was\nadmiring two crossed foils over his chimney-piece, with a death's head on the guitar above them.\nThe difficulty was the consent of his mother; nothing, however, seemed more reasonable. Even his\nemployer advised him to go to some other chambers where he could advance more rapidly. Taking a\nmiddle course, then, Leon looked for some place as second clerk at Rouen; found none, and at last wrote\nhis mother a long letter full of details, in which he set forth the reasons for going to live at Paris\nimmediately. She consented.\nHe did not hurry. Every day for a month Hivert carried boxes, valises, parcels for him from Yonville to\nRouen and from Rouen to Yonville; and when Leon had packed up his wardrobe, had his three arm-chairs\nrestuffed, bought a stock of neckties, in a word, had made more preparations than for a voyage around the\nworld, he put it off from week to week, until he received a second letter from his mother urging him to\nleave, since he wanted to pass his examination before the vacation.\nWhen the moment for the farewells had come, Madame Homais wept, Justin sobbed; Homais, as a man of\nnerve, concealed his emotion; he wished to carry his friend's overcoat himself as far as the gate of the\nnotary, who was taking Leon to Rouen in his carriage.\nThe latter had just time to bid farewell to Monsieur Bovary.\nWhen he reached the head of the stairs, he stopped, he was so out of breath. As he came in, Madame\nBovary arose hurriedly.\n\"It is I again!\" said Leon.\n\"I was sure of it!\"\nShe bit her lips, and a rush of blood flowing under her skin made her red from the roots of her hair to the\ntop of her collar. She remained standing, leaning with her shoulder against the wainscot.\n\"The doctor is not here?\" he went on.\n-62\n\n\"He is out.\" She repeated, \"He is out.\"\nThen there was silence. They looked at one another and their thoughts, confounded in the same agony,\nclung close together like two throbbing breasts.\n\"I should like to kiss Berthe,\" said Leon.\nEmma went down a few steps and called Felicite.\nHe threw one long look around him that took in the walls, the decorations, the fireplace, as if to penetrate\neverything, carry away everything. But she returned, and the servant brought Berthe, who was swinging a\nwindmill roof downwards at the end of a string. Leon kissed her several times on the neck.\n\"Good-bye, poor child! good-bye, dear little one! good-bye!\" And he gave her back to her mother.\n\"Take her away,\" she said.\nThey remained alone--Madame Bovary, her back turned, her face pressed against a window-pane; Leon\nheld his cap in his hand, knocking it softly against his thigh.\n\"It is going to rain,\" said Emma.\n\"I have a cloak,\" he answered.\n\"Ah!\"\nShe turned around, her chin lowered, her forehead bent forward.\nThe light fell on it as on a piece of marble, to the curve of the eyebrows, without one's being able to guess\nwhat Emma was seeing on the horizon or what she was thinking within herself.\n\"Well, good-bye,\" he sighed.\nShe raised her head with a quick movement.\n\"Yes, good-bye--go!\"\nThey advanced towards each other; he held out his hand; she hesitated.\n\"In the English fashion, then,\" she said, giving her own hand wholly to him, and forcing a laugh.\nLeon felt it between his fingers, and the very essence of all his being seemed to pass down into that moist\npalm. Then he opened his hand; their eyes met again, and he disappeared.\nWhen he reached the market-place, he stopped and hid behind a pillar to look for the last time at this\nwhite house with the four green blinds. He thought he saw a shadow behind the window in the room; but\nthe curtain, sliding along the pole as though no one were touching it, slowly opened its long oblique folds\nthat spread out with a single movement, and thus hung straight and motionless as a plaster wall. Leon set\noff running.\nFrom afar he saw his employer's gig in the road, and by it a man in a coarse apron holding the horse.\n-63\n\nHomais and Monsieur Guillaumin were talking. They were waiting for him.\n\"Embrace me,\" said the druggist with tears in his eyes. \"Here is your coat, my good friend. Mind the cold;\ntake care of yourself; look after yourself.\"\n\"Come, Leon, jump in,\" said the notary.\nHomais bend over the splash-board, and in a voice broken by sobs uttered these three sad words--\n\"A pleasant journey!\"\n\"Good-night,\" said Monsieur Guillaumin. \"Give him his head.\" They set out, and Homais went back.\nMadame Bovary had opened her window overlooking the garden and watched the clouds. They gathered\naround the sunset on the side of Rouen and then swiftly rolled back their black columns, behind which the\ngreat rays of the sun looked out like the golden arrows of a suspended trophy, while the rest of the empty\nheavens was white as porcelain. But a gust of wind bowed the poplars, and suddenly the rain fell; it\npattered against the green leaves.\nThen the sun reappeared, the hens clucked, sparrows shook their wings in the damp thickets, and the\npools of water on the gravel as they flowed away carried off the pink flowers of an acacia.\n\"Ah! how far off he must be already!\" she thought.\nMonsieur Homais, as usual, came at half-past six during dinner.\n\"Well,\" said he, \"so we've sent off our young friend!\"\n\"So it seems,\" replied the doctor. Then turning on his chair; \"Any news at home?\"\n\"Nothing much. Only my wife was a little moved this afternoon. You know women--a nothing upsets\nthem, especially my wife. And we should be wrong to object to that, since their nervous organization is\nmuch more malleable than ours.\"\n\"Poor Leon!\" said Charles. \"How will he live at Paris? Will he get used to it?\"\nMadame Bovary sighed.\n\"Get along!\" said the chemist, smacking his lips. \"The outings at restaurants, the masked balls, the\nchampagne--all that'll be jolly enough, I assure you.\"\n\"I don't think he'll go wrong,\" objected Bovary.\n\"Nor do I,\" said Monsieur Homais quickly; \"although he'll have to do like the rest for fear of passing for\na Jesuit. And you don't know what a life those dogs lead in the Latin quarter with actresses. Besides,\nstudents are thought a great deal of in Paris. Provided they have a few accomplishments, they are received\nin the best society; there are even ladies of the Faubourg Saint-Germain who fall in love with them, which\nsubsequently furnishes them opportunities for making very good matches.\"\n\"But,\" said the doctor, \"I fear for him that down there--\"\n-64\n\n\"You are right,\" interrupted the chemist; \"that is the reverse of the medal. And one is constantly obliged\nto keep one's hand in one's pocket there. Thus, we will suppose you are in a public garden. An individual\npresents himself, well dressed, even wearing an order, and whom one would take for a diplomatist. He\napproaches you, he insinuates himself; offers you a pinch of snuff, or picks up your hat. Then you\nbecome more intimate; he takes you to a cafe, invites you to his country-house, introduces you, between\ntwo drinks, to all sorts of people; and three-fourths of the time it's only to plunder your watch or lead you\ninto some pernicious step.\n\"That is true,\" said Charles; \"but I was thinking especially of illnesses--of typhoid fever, for example,\nthat attacks students from the provinces.\"\nEmma shuddered.\n\"Because of the change of regimen,\" continued the chemist, \"and of the perturbation that results\ntherefrom in the whole system. And then the water at Paris, don't you know! The dishes at restaurants, all\nthe spiced food, end by heating the blood, and are not worth, whatever people may say of them, a good\nsoup. For my own part, I have always preferred plain living; it is more healthy. So when I was studying\npharmacy at Rouen, I boarded in a boarding house; I dined with the professors.\"\nAnd thus he went on, expounding his opinions generally and his personal likings, until Justin came to\nfetch him for a mulled egg that was wanted.\n\"Not a moment's peace!\" he cried; \"always at it! I can't go out for a minute! Like a plough-horse, I have\nalways to be moiling and toiling. What drudgery!\" Then, when he was at the door, \"By the way, do you\nknow the news?\"\n\"What news?\"\n\"That it is very likely,\" Homais went on, raising his eyebrows and assuming one of his most serious\nexpression, \"that the agricultural meeting of the Seine-Inferieure will be held this year at\nYonville-l'Abbaye. The rumour, at all events, is going the round. This morning the paper alluded to it. It\nwould be of the utmost importance for our district. But we'll talk it over later on. I can see, thank you;\nJustin has the lantern.\"\nChapter Seven\nThe next day was a dreary one for Emma. Everything seemed to her enveloped in a black atmosphere\nfloating confusedly over the exterior of things, and sorrow was engulfed within her soul with soft shrieks\nsuch as the winter wind makes in ruined castles. It was that reverie which we give to things that will not\nreturn, the lassitude that seizes you after everything was done; that pain, in fine, that the interruption of\nevery wonted movement, the sudden cessation of any prolonged vibration, brings on.\nAs on the return from Vaubyessard, when the quadrilles were running in her head, she was full of a\ngloomy melancholy, of a numb despair. Leon reappeared, taller, handsomer, more charming, more vague.\nThough separated from her, he had not left her; he was there, and the walls of the house seemed to hold\nhis shadow.\nShe could not detach her eyes from the carpet where he had walked, from those empty chairs where he\nhad sat. The river still flowed on, and slowly drove its ripples along the slippery banks.\nThey had often walked there to the murmur of the waves over the moss-covered pebbles. How bright the\nsun had been! What happy afternoons they had seen along in the shade at the end of the garden! He read\n-65\n\naloud, bareheaded, sitting on a footstool of dry sticks; the fresh wind of the meadow set trembling the\nleaves of the book and the nasturtiums of the arbour. Ah! he was gone, the only charm of her life, the only\npossible hope of joy. Why had she not seized this happiness when it came to her? Why not have kept hold\nof it with both hands, with both knees, when it was about to flee from her? And she cursed herself for not\nhaving loved Leon. She thirsted for his lips. The wish took possession of her to run after and rejoin him,\nthrow herself into his arms and say to him, \"It is I; I am yours.\" But Emma recoiled beforehand at the\ndifficulties of the enterprise, and her desires, increased by regret, became only the more acute.\nHenceforth the memory of Leon was the centre of her boredom; it burnt there more brightly than the fire\ntravellers have left on the snow of a Russian steppe. She sprang towards him, she pressed against him, she\nstirred carefully the dying embers, sought all around her anything that could revive it; and the most\ndistant reminiscences, like the most immediate occasions, what she experienced as well as what she\nimagined, her voluptuous desires that were unsatisfied, her projects of happiness that crackled in the wind\nlike dead boughs, her sterile virtue, her lost hopes, the domestic tete-a-tete--she gathered it all up, took\neverything, and made it all serve as fuel for her melancholy.\nThe flames, however, subsided, either because the supply had exhausted itself, or because it had been\npiled up too much. Love, little by little, was quelled by absence; regret stifled beneath habit; and this\nincendiary light that had empurpled her pale sky was overspread and faded by degrees. In the supineness\nof her conscience she even took her repugnance towards her husband for aspirations towards her lover,\nthe burning of hate for the warmth of tenderness; but as the tempest still raged, and as passion burnt itself\ndown to the very cinders, and no help came, no sun rose, there was night on all sides, and she was lost in\nthe terrible cold that pierced her.\nThen the evil days of Tostes began again. She thought herself now far more unhappy; for she had the\nexperience of grief, with the certainty that it would not end.\nA woman who had laid on herself such sacrifices could well allow herself certain whims. She bought a\nGothic prie-dieu, and in a month spent fourteen francs on lemons for polishing her nails; she wrote to\nRouen for a blue cashmere gown; she chose one of Lheureux's finest scarves, and wore it knotted around\nher waist over her dressing-gown; and, with closed blinds and a book in her hand, she lay stretched out on\na couch in this garb.\nShe often changed her coiffure; she did her hair a la Chinoise, in flowing curls, in plaited coils; she parted\nin on one side and rolled it under like a man's.\nShe wanted to learn Italian; she bought dictionaries, a grammar, and a supply of white paper. She tried\nserious reading, history, and philosophy. Sometimes in the night Charles woke up with a start, thinking he\nwas being called to a patient. \"I'm coming,\" he stammered; and it was the noise of a match Emma had\nstruck to relight the lamp. But her reading fared like her piece of embroidery, all of which, only just\nbegun, filled her cupboard; she took it up, left it, passed on to other books.\nShe had attacks in which she could easily have been driven to commit any folly. She maintained one day,\nin opposition to her husband, that she could drink off a large glass of brandy, and, as Charles was stupid\nenough to dare her to, she swallowed the brandy to the last drop.\nIn spite of her vapourish airs (as the housewives of Yonville called them), Emma, all the same, never\nseemed gay, and usually she had at the corners of her mouth that immobile contraction that puckers the\nfaces of old maids, and those of men whose ambition has failed. She was pale all over, white as a sheet;\nthe skin of her nose was drawn at the nostrils, her eyes looked at you vaguely. After discovering three\ngrey hairs on her temples, she talked much of her old age.\n-66\n\nShe often fainted. One day she even spat blood, and, as Charles fussed around her showing his anxiety--\n\"Bah!\" she answered, \"what does it matter?\"\nCharles fled to his study and wept there, both his elbows on the table, sitting in an arm-chair at his bureau\nunder the phrenological head.\nThen he wrote to his mother begging her to come, and they had many long consultations together on the\nsubject of Emma.\nWhat should they decide? What was to be done since she rejected all medical treatment? \"Do you know\nwhat your wife wants?\" replied Madame Bovary senior.\n\"She wants to be forced to occupy herself with some manual work. If she were obliged, like so many\nothers, to earn her living, she wouldn't have these vapours, that come to her from a lot of ideas she stuffs\ninto her head, and from the idleness in which she lives.\nYet she is always busy,\" said Charles.\n\"Ah! always busy at what? Reading novels, bad books, works against religion, and in which they mock at\npriests in speeches taken from Voltaire. But all that leads you far astray, my poor child. Anyone who has\nno religion always ends by turning out badly.\"\nSo it was decided to stop Emma reading novels. The enterprise did not seem easy. The good lady\nundertook it. She was, when she passed through Rouen, to go herself to the lending-library and represent\nthat Emma had discontinued her subscription. Would they not have a right to apply to the police if the\nlibrarian persisted all the same in his poisonous trade? The farewells of mother and daughter-in-law were\ncold. During the three weeks that they had been together they had not exchanged half-a-dozen words\napart from the inquiries and phrases when they met at table and in the evening before going to bed.\nMadame Bovary left on a Wednesday, the market-day at Yonville.\nThe Place since morning had been blocked by a row of carts, which, on end and their shafts in the air,\nspread all along the line of houses from the church to the inn. On the other side there were canvas booths,\nwhere cotton checks, blankets, and woollen stockings were sold, together with harness for horses, and\npackets of blue ribbon, whose ends fluttered in the wind. The coarse hardware was spread out on the\nground between pyramids of eggs and hampers of cheeses, from which sticky straw stuck out.\nNear the corn-machines clucking hens passed their necks through the bars of flat cages. The people,\ncrowding in the same place and unwilling to move thence, sometimes threatened to smash the shop front\nof the chemist. On Wednesdays his shop was never empty, and the people pushed in less to buy drugs\nthan for consultations. So great was Homais' reputation in the neighbouring villages. His robust aplomb\nhad fascinated the rustics. They considered him a greater doctor than all the doctors.\nEmma was leaning out at the window; she was often there. The window in the provinces replaces the\ntheatre and the promenade, she was amusing herself with watching the crowd of boors when she saw a\ngentleman in a green velvet coat. He had on yellow gloves, although he wore heavy gaiters; he was\ncoming towards the doctor's house, followed by a peasant walking with a bent head and quite a\nthoughtful air.\n\"Can I see the doctor?\" he asked Justin, who was talking on the doorsteps with Felicite, and, taking him\n-67\n\nfor a servant of the house--\"Tell him that Monsieur Rodolphe Boulanger of La Huchette is here.\"\nIt was not from territorial vanity that the new arrival added \"of La Huchette\" to his name, but to make\nhimself the better known.\nLa Huchette, in fact, was an estate near Yonville, where he had just bought the chateau and two farms that\nhe cultivated himself, without, however, troubling very much about them. He lived as a bachelor, and was\nsupposed to have \"at least fifteen thousand francs a year.\"\nCharles came into the room. Monsieur Boulanger introduced his man, who wanted to be bled because he\nfelt \"a tingling all over.\"\n\"That'll purge me,\" he urged as an objection to all reasoning.\nSo Bovary ordered a bandage and a basin, and asked Justin to hold it. Then addressing the peasant, who\nwas already pale--\n\"Don't be afraid, my lad.\"\n\"No, no, sir,\" said the other; \"get on.\"\nAnd with an air of bravado he held out his great arm. At the prick of the lancet the blood spurted out,\nsplashing against the looking-glass.\n\"Hold the basin nearer,\" exclaimed Charles.\n\"Lor!\" said the peasant, \"one would swear it was a little fountain flowing. How red my blood is! That's a\ngood sign, isn't it?\"\n\"Sometimes,\" answered the doctor, \"one feels nothing at first, and then syncope sets in, and more\nespecially with people of strong constitution like this man.\"\nAt these words the rustic let go the lancet-case he was twisting between his fingers. A shudder of his\nshoulders made the chair-back creak. His hat fell off.\n\"I thought as much,\" said Bovary, pressing his finger on the vein.\nThe basin was beginning to tremble in Justin's hands; his knees shook, he turned pale.\n\"Emma! Emma!\" called Charles.\nWith one bound she came down the staircase.\n\"Some vinegar,\" he cried. \"O dear! two at once!\"\nAnd in his emotion he could hardly put on the compress.\n\"It is nothing,\" said Monsieur Boulanger quietly, taking Justin in his arms. He seated him on the table\nwith his back resting against the wall.\nMadame Bovary began taking off his cravat. The strings of his shirt had got into a knot, and she was for\n-68\n\nsome minutes moving her light fingers about the young fellow's neck. Then she poured some vinegar on\nher cambric handkerchief; she moistened his temples with little dabs, and then blew upon them softly.\nThe ploughman revived, but Justin's syncope still lasted, and his eyeballs disappeared in the pale\nsclerotics like blue flowers in milk.\n\"We must hide this from him,\" said Charles.\nMadame Bovary took the basin to put it under the table. With the movement she made in bending down,\nher dress (it was a summer dress with four flounces, yellow, long in the waist and wide in the skirt) spread\nout around her on the flags of the room; and as Emma stooping, staggered a little as she stretched out her\narms.\nThe stuff here and there gave with the inflections of her bust.\nThen she went to fetch a bottle of water, and she was melting some pieces of sugar when the chemist\narrived. The servant had been to fetch him in the tumult. Seeing his pupil's eyes staring he drew a long\nbreath; then going around him he looked at him from head to foot.\n\"Fool!\" he said, \"really a little fool! A fool in four letters! A phlebotomy's a big affair, isn't it! And a\nfellow who isn't afraid of anything; a kind of squirrel, just as he is who climbs to vertiginous heights to\nshake down nuts. Oh, yes! you just talk to me, boast about yourself! Here's a fine fitness for practising\npharmacy later on; for under serious circumstances you may be called before the tribunals in order to\nenlighten the minds of the magistrates, and you would have to keep your head then, to reason, show\nyourself a man, or else pass for an imbecile.\"\nJustin did not answer. The chemist went on--\n\"Who asked you to come? You are always pestering the doctor and madame. On Wednesday, moreover,\nyour presence is indispensable to me. There are now twenty people in the shop. I left everything because\nof the interest I take in you. Come, get along! Sharp! Wait for me, and keep an eye on the jars.\"\nWhen Justin, who was rearranging his dress, had gone, they talked for a little while about fainting-fits.\nMadame Bovary had never fainted.\n\"That is extraordinary for a lady,\" said Monsieur Boulanger; \"but some people are very susceptible. Thus\nin a duel, I have seen a second lose consciousness at the mere sound of the loading of pistols.\"\n\"For my part,\" said the chemist, \"the sight of other people's blood doesn't affect me at all, but the mere\nthought of my own flowing would make me faint if I reflected upon it too much.\"\nMonsieur Boulanger, however, dismissed his servant, advising him to calm himself, since his fancy was\nover.\n\"It procured me the advantage of making your acquaintance,\" he added, and he looked at Emma as he\nsaid this. Then he put three francs on the corner of the table, bowed negligently, and went out.\nHe was soon on the other side of the river (this was his way back to La Huchette), and Emma saw him in\nthe meadow, walking under the poplars, slackening his pace now and then as one who reflects.\n\"She is very pretty,\" he said to himself; \"she is very pretty, this doctor's wife. Fine teeth, black eyes, a\ndainty foot, a figure like a Parisienne's. Where the devil does she come from? Wherever did that fat\n-69\n\nfellow pick her up?\"\nMonsieur Rodolphe Boulanger was thirty-four; he was of brutal temperament and intelligent perspicacity,\nhaving, moreover, had much to do with women, and knowing them well. This one had seemed pretty to\nhim; so he was thinking about her and her husband.\n\"I think he is very stupid. She is tired of him, no doubt. He has dirty nails, and hasn't shaved for three\ndays. While he is trotting after his patients, she sits there botching socks. And she gets bored! She would\nlike to live in town and dance polkas every evening. Poor little woman! She is gaping after love like a\ncarp after water on a kitchen-table. With three words of gallantry she'd adore one, I'm sure of it. She'd be\ntender, charming. Yes; but how to get rid of her afterwards?\"\nThen the difficulties of love-making seen in the distance made him by contrast think of his mistress. She\nwas an actress at Rouen, whom he kept; and when he had pondered over this image, with which, even in\nremembrance, he was satiated--\n\"Ah! Madame Bovary,\" he thought, \"is much prettier, especially fresher. Virginie is decidedly beginning\nto grow fat. She is so finikin about her pleasures; and, besides, she has a mania for prawns.\"\nThe fields were empty, and around him Rodolphe only heard the regular beating of the grass striking\nagainst his boots, with a cry of the grasshopper hidden at a distance among the oats. He again saw Emma\nin her room, dressed as he had seen her, and he undressed her.\n\"Oh, I will have her,\" he cried, striking a blow with his stick at a clod in front of him. And he at once\nbegan to consider the political part of the enterprise. He asked himself--\n\"Where shall we meet? By what means? We shall always be having the brat on our hands, and the\nservant, the neighbours, and husband, all sorts of worries. Pshaw! one would lose too much time over it.\"\nThen he resumed, \"She really has eyes that pierce one's heart like a gimlet. And that pale complexion! I\nadore pale women!\"\nWhen he reached the top of the Arguiel hills he had made up his mind. \"It's only finding the\nopportunities. Well, I will call in now and then. I'll send them venison, poultry; I'll have myself bled, if\nneed be. We shall become friends; I'll invite them to my place. By Jove!\" added he, \"there's the\nagricultural show coming on. She'll be there. I shall see her. We'll begin boldly, for that's the surest\nway.\"\nChapter Eight\nAt last it came, the famous agricultural show. On the morning of the solemnity all the inhabitants at their\ndoors were chatting over the preparations. The pediment of the town hall had been hung with garlands of\nivy; a tent had been erected in a meadow for the banquet; and in the middle of the Place, in front of the\nchurch, a kind of bombarde was to announce the arrival of the prefect and the names of the successful\nfarmers who had obtained prizes. The National Guard of Buchy (there was none at Yonville) had come to\njoin the corps of firemen, of whom Binet was captain. On that day he wore a collar even higher than\nusual; and, tightly buttoned in his tunic, his figure was so stiff and motionless that the whole vital portion\nof his person seemed to have descended into his legs, which rose in a cadence of set steps with a single\nmovement. As there was some rivalry between the tax-collector and the colonel, both, to show off their\ntalents, drilled their men separately. One saw the red epaulettes and the black breastplates pass and\nre-pass alternately; there was no end to it, and it constantly began again. There had never been such a\ndisplay of pomp. Several citizens had scoured their houses the evening before; tri-coloured flags hung\n-70\n\nfrom half-open windows; all the public-houses were full; and in the lovely weather the starched caps, the\ngolden crosses, and the coloured neckerchiefs seemed whiter than snow, shone in the sun, and relieved\nwith the motley colours the sombre monotony of the frock-coats and blue smocks. The neighbouring\nfarmers' wives, when they got off their horses, pulled out the long pins that fastened around them their\ndresses, turned up for fear of mud; and the husbands, for their part, in order to save their hats, kept their\nhandkerchiefs around them, holding one corner between their teeth.\nThe crowd came into the main street from both ends of the village. People poured in from the lanes, the\nalleys, the houses; and from time to time one heard knockers banging against doors closing behind\nwomen with their gloves, who were going out to see the fete. What was most admired were two long\nlamp-stands covered with lanterns, that flanked a platform on which the authorities were to sit. Besides\nthis there were against the four columns of the town hall four kinds of poles, each bearing a small\nstandard of greenish cloth, embellished with inscriptions in gold letters.\nOn one was written, \"To Commerce\"; on the other, \"To Agriculture\"; on the third, \"To Industry\"; and on\nthe fourth, \"To the Fine Arts.\"\nBut the jubilation that brightened all faces seemed to darken that of Madame Lefrancois, the innkeeper.\nStanding on her kitchen-steps she muttered to herself, \"What rubbish! what rubbish! With their canvas\nbooth! Do they think the prefect will be glad to dine down there under a tent like a gipsy? They call all\nthis fussing doing good to the place! Then it wasn't worth while sending to Neufchatel for the keeper of a\ncookshop! And for whom? For cowherds! tatterdemalions!\"\nThe druggist was passing. He had on a frock-coat, nankeen trousers, beaver shoes, and, for a wonder, a\nhat with a low crown.\n\"Your servant! Excuse me, I am in a hurry.\" And as the fat widow asked where he was going--\n\"It seems odd to you, doesn't it, I who am always more cooped up in my laboratory than the man's rat in\nhis cheese.\"\n\"What cheese?\" asked the landlady.\n\"Oh, nothing! nothing!\" Homais continued. \"I merely wished to convey to you, Madame Lefrancois, that\nI usually live at home like a recluse. To-day, however, considering the circumstances, it is necessary--\"\n\"Oh, you're going down there!\" she said contemptuously.\n\"Yes, I am going,\" replied the druggist, astonished. \"Am I not a member of the consulting commission?\"\nMere Lefrancois looked at him for a few moments, and ended by saying with a smile--\n\"That's another pair of shoes! But what does agriculture matter to you? Do you understand anything\nabout it?\"\n\"Certainly I understand it, since I am a druggist--that is to say, a chemist. And the object of chemistry,\nMadame Lefrancois, being the knowledge of the reciprocal and molecular action of all natural bodies, it\nfollows that agriculture is comprised within its domain. And, in fact, the composition of the manure, the\nfermentation of liquids, the analyses of gases, and the influence of miasmata, what, I ask you, is all this, if\nit isn't chemistry, pure and simple?\"\n-71\n\nThe landlady did not answer. Homais went on--\n\"Do you think that to be an agriculturist it is necessary to have tilled the earth or fattened fowls oneself? It\nis necessary rather to know the composition of the substances in question--the geological strata, the\natmospheric actions, the quality of the soil, the minerals, the waters, the density of the different bodies,\ntheir capillarity, and what not. And one must be master of all the principles of hygiene in order to direct,\ncriticize the construction of buildings, the feeding of animals, the diet of domestics. And, moreover,\nMadame Lefrancois, one must know botany, be able to distinguish between plants, you understand, which\nare the wholesome and those that are deleterious, which are unproductive and which nutritive, if it is well\nto pull them up here and re-sow them there, to propagate some, destroy others; in brief, one must keep\npace with science by means of pamphlets and public papers, be always on the alert to find out\nimprovements.\"\nThe landlady never took her eyes off the \"Cafe Francois\" and the chemist went on--\n\"Would to God our agriculturists were chemists, or that at least they would pay more attention to the\ncounsels of science. Thus lately I myself wrote a considerable tract, a memoir of over seventy-two pages,\nentitled, 'Cider, its Manufacture and its Effects, together with some New Reflections on the Subject,' that\nI sent to the Agricultural Society of Rouen, and which even procured me the honour of being received\namong its members--Section, Agriculture; Class, Pomological. Well, if my work had been given to the\npublic--\" But the druggist stopped, Madame Lefrancois seemed so preoccupied.\n\"Just look at them!\" she said. \"It's past comprehension! Such a cookshop as that!\" And with a shrug of\nthe shoulders that stretched out over her breast the stitches of her knitted bodice, she pointed with both\nhands at her rival's inn, whence songs were heard issuing. \"Well, it won't last long,\" she added. \"It'll be\nover before a week.\"\nHomais drew back with stupefaction. She came down three steps and whispered in his ear--\n\"What! you didn't know it? There is to be an execution in next week. It's Lheureux who is selling him\nout; he has killed him with bills.\"\n\"What a terrible catastrophe!\" cried the druggist, who always found expressions in harmony with all\nimaginable circumstances.\nThen the landlady began telling him the story that she had heard from Theodore, Monsieur Guillaumin's\nservant, and although she detested Tellier, she blamed Lheureux. He was \"a wheedler, a sneak.\"\n\"There!\" she said. \"Look at him! he is in the market; he is bowing to Madame Bovary, who's got on a\ngreen bonnet. Why, she's taking Monsieur Boulanger's arm.\"\n\"Madame Bovary!\" exclaimed Homais. \"I must go at once and pay her my respects. Perhaps she'll be\nvery glad to have a seat in the enclosure under the peristyle.\" And, without heeding Madame Lefrancois,\nwho was calling him back to tell him more about it, the druggist walked off rapidly with a smile on his\nlips, with straight knees, bowing copiously to right and left, and taking up much room with the large tails\nof his frock-coat that fluttered behind him in the wind.\nRodolphe, having caught sight of him from afar, hurried on, but Madame Bovary lost her breath; so he\nwalked more slowly, and, smiling at her, said in a rough tone--\n\"It's only to get away from that fat fellow, you know, the druggist.\" She pressed his elbow.\n-72\n\n\"What's the meaning of that?\" he asked himself. And he looked at her out of the corner of his eyes.\nHer profile was so calm that one could guess nothing from it. It stood out in the light from the oval of her\nbonnet, with pale ribbons on it like the leaves of weeds. Her eyes with their long curved lashes looked\nstraight before her, and though wide open, they seemed slightly puckered by the cheek-bones, because of\nthe blood pulsing gently under the delicate skin. A pink line ran along the partition between her nostrils.\nHer head was bent upon her shoulder, and the pearl tips of her white teeth were seen between her lips.\n\"Is she making fun of me?\" thought Rodolphe.\nEmma's gesture, however, had only been meant for a warning; for Monsieur Lheureux was\naccompanying them, and spoke now and again as if to enter into the conversation.\n\"What a superb day! Everybody is out! The wind is east!\"\nAnd neither Madame Bovary nor Rodolphe answered him, whilst at the slightest movement made by\nthem he drew near, saying, \"I beg your pardon!\" and raised his hat.\nWhen they reached the farrier's house, instead of following the road up to the fence, Rodolphe suddenly\nturned down a path, drawing with him Madame Bovary. He called out--\n\"Good evening, Monsieur Lheureux! See you again presently.\"\n\"How you got rid of him!\" she said, laughing.\n\"Why,\" he went on, \"allow oneself to be intruded upon by others? And as to-day I have the happiness of\nbeing with you--\"\nEmma blushed. He did not finish his sentence. Then he talked of the fine weather and of the pleasure of\nwalking on the grass. A few daisies had sprung up again.\n\"Here are some pretty Easter daisies,\" he said, \"and enough of them to furnish oracles to all the amorous\nmaids in the place.\"\nHe added, \"Shall I pick some? What do you think?\"\n\"Are you in love?\" she asked, coughing a little.\n\"H'm, h'm! who knows?\" answered Rodolphe.\nThe meadow began to fill, and the housewives hustled you with their great umbrellas, their baskets, and\ntheir babies. One had often to get out of the way of a long file of country folk, servant-maids with blue\nstockings, flat shoes, silver rings, and who smelt of milk, when one passed close to them. They walked\nalong holding one another by the hand, and thus they spread over the whole field from the row of open\ntrees to the banquet tent.\nBut this was the examination time, and the farmers one after the other entered a kind of enclosure formed\nby a long cord supported on sticks.\nThe beasts were there, their noses towards the cord, and making a confused line with their unequal rumps.\nDrowsy pigs were burrowing in the earth with their snouts, calves were bleating, lambs baaing; the cows,\n-73\n\non knees folded in, were stretching their bellies on the grass, slowly chewing the cud, and blinking their\nheavy eyelids at the gnats that buzzed round them. Plough-men with bare arms were holding by the halter\nprancing stallions that neighed with dilated nostrils looking towards the mares. These stood quietly,\nstretching out their heads and flowing manes, while their foals rested in their shadow, or now and then\ncame and sucked them. And above the long undulation of these crowded animals one saw some white\nmane rising in the wind like a wave, or some sharp horns sticking out, and the heads of men running\nabout. Apart, outside the enclosure, a hundred paces off, was a large black bull, muzzled, with an iron\nring in its nostrils, and who moved no more than if he had been in bronze. A child in rags was holding\nhim by a rope.\nBetween the two lines the committee-men were walking with heavy steps, examining each animal, then\nconsulting one another in a low voice. One who seemed of more importance now and then took notes in a\nbook as he walked along. This was the president of the jury, Monsieur Derozerays de la Panville. As soon\nas he recognised Rodolphe he came forward quickly, and smiling amiably, said--\n\"What! Monsieur Boulanger, you are deserting us?\"\nRodolphe protested that he was just coming. But when the president had disappeared--\n\"Ma foi![12]\" said he, \"I shall not go. Your company is better than his.\"\n[12]Upon my word!\nAnd while poking fun at the show, Rodolphe, to move about more easily, showed the gendarme his blue\ncard, and even stopped now and then in front of some fine beast, which Madame Bovary did not at all\nadmire. He noticed this, and began jeering at the Yonville ladies and their dresses; then he apologised for\nthe negligence of his own. He had that incongruity of common and elegant in which the habitually vulgar\nthink they see the revelation of an eccentric existence, of the perturbations of sentiment, the tyrannies of\nart, and always a certain contempt for social conventions, that seduces or exasperates them. Thus his\ncambric shirt with plaited cuffs was blown out by the wind in the opening of his waistcoat of grey ticking,\nand his broad-striped trousers disclosed at the ankle nankeen boots with patent leather gaiters.\nThese were so polished that they reflected the grass. He trampled on horses's dung with them, one hand\nin the pocket of his jacket and his straw hat on one side.\n\"Besides,\" added he, \"when one lives in the country--\"\n\"It's waste of time,\" said Emma.\n\"That is true,\" replied Rodolphe. \"To think that not one of these people is capable of understanding even\nthe cut of a coat!\"\nThen they talked about provincial mediocrity, of the lives it crushed, the illusions lost there.\n\"And I too,\" said Rodolphe, \"am drifting into depression.\"\n\"You!\" she said in astonishment; \"I thought you very light-hearted.\"\n\"Ah! yes. I seem so, because in the midst of the world I know how to wear the mask of a scoffer upon my\nface; and yet, how many a time at the sight of a cemetery by moonlight have I not asked myself whether it\nwere not better to join those sleeping there!\"\n-74\n\n\"Oh! and your friends?\" she said. \"You do not think of them.\"\n\"My friends! What friends? Have I any? Who cares for me?\" And he accompanied the last words with a\nkind of whistling of the lips.\nBut they were obliged to separate from each other because of a great pile of chairs that a man was\ncarrying behind them. He was so overladen with them that one could only see the tips of his wooden\nshoes and the ends of his two outstretched arms. It was Lestiboudois, the gravedigger, who was carrying\nthe church chairs about amongst the people. Alive to all that concerned his interests, he had hit upon this\nmeans of turning the show to account; and his idea was succeeding, for he no longer knew which way to\nturn. In fact, the villagers, who were hot, quarreled for these seats, whose straw smelt of incense, and they\nleant against the thick backs, stained with the wax of candles, with a certain veneration.\nMadame Bovary again took Rodolphe's arm; he went on as if speaking to himself--\n\"Yes, I have missed so many things. Always alone! Ah! if I had some aim in life, if I had met some love,\nif I had found someone! Oh, how I would have spent all the energy of which I am capable, surmounted\neverything, overcome everything!\"\n\"Yet it seems to me,\" said Emma, \"that you are not to be pitied.\"\n\"Ah! you think so?\" said Rodolphe.\n\"For, after all,\" she went on, \"you are free--\" she hesitated, \"rich--\"\n\"Do not mock me,\" he replied.\nAnd she protested that she was not mocking him, when the report of a cannon resounded. Immediately all\nbegan hustling one another pell-mell towards the village.\nIt was a false alarm. The prefect seemed not to be coming, and the members of the jury felt much\nembarrassed, not knowing if they ought to begin the meeting or still wait.\nAt last at the end of the Place a large hired landau appeared, drawn by two thin horses, which a coachman\nin a white hat was whipping lustily. Binet had only just time to shout, \"Present arms!\" and the colonel to\nimitate him. All ran towards the enclosure; everyone pushed forward. A few even forgot their collars; but\nthe equipage of the prefect seemed to anticipate the crowd, and the two yoked jades, trapesing in their\nharness, came up at a little trot in front of the peristyle of the town hall at the very moment when the\nNational Guard and firemen deployed, beating drums and marking time.\n\"Present!\" shouted Binet.\n\"Halt!\" shouted the colonel. \"Left about, march.\"\nAnd after presenting arms, during which the clang of the band, letting loose, rang out like a brass kettle\nrolling downstairs, all the guns were lowered. Then was seen stepping down from the carriage a\ngentleman in a short coat with silver braiding, with bald brow, and wearing a tuft of hair at the back of his\nhead, of a sallow complexion and the most benign appearance. His eyes, very large and covered by heavy\nlids, were half-closed to look at the crowd, while at the same time he raised his sharp nose, and forced a\nsmile upon his sunken mouth. He recognised the mayor by his scarf, and explained to him that the prefect\nwas not able to come. He himself was a councillor at the prefecture; then he added a few apologies.\n-75\n\nMonsieur Tuvache answered them with compliments; the other confessed himself nervous; and they\nremained thus, face to face, their foreheads almost touching, with the members of the jury all round, the\nmunicipal council, the notable personages, the National Guard and the crowd. The councillor pressing his\nlittle cocked hat to his breast repeated his bows, while Tuvache, bent like a bow, also smiled, stammered,\ntried to say something, protested his devotion to the monarchy and the honour that was being done to\nYonville.\nHippolyte, the groom from the inn, took the head of the horses from the coachman, and, limping along\nwith his club-foot, led them to the door of the \"Lion d'Or\", where a number of peasants collected to look\nat the carriage. The drum beat, the howitzer thundered, and the gentlemen one by one mounted the\nplatform, where they sat down in red utrecht velvet arm-chairs that had been lent by Madame Tuvache.\nAll these people looked alike. Their fair flabby faces, somewhat tanned by the sun, were the colour of\nsweet cider, and their puffy whiskers emerged from stiff collars, kept up by white cravats with broad\nbows. All the waist-coats were of velvet, double-breasted; all the watches had, at the end of a long ribbon,\nan oval cornelian seal; everyone rested his two hands on his thighs, carefully stretching the stride of their\ntrousers, whose unsponged glossy cloth shone more brilliantly than the leather of their heavy boots.\nThe ladies of the company stood at the back under the vestibule between the pillars while the common\nherd was opposite, standing up or sitting on chairs. As a matter of fact, Lestiboudois had brought thither\nall those that he had moved from the field, and he even kept running back every minute to fetch others\nfrom the church. He caused such confusion with this piece of business that one had great difficulty in\ngetting to the small steps of the platform.\n\"I think,\" said Monsieur Lheureux to the chemist, who was passing to his place, \"that they ought to have\nput up two Venetian masts with something rather severe and rich for ornaments; it would have been a\nvery pretty effect.\"\n\"To be sure,\" replied Homais; \"but what can you expect? The mayor took everything on his own\nshoulders. He hasn't much taste. Poor Tuvache! and he is even completely destitute of what is called the\ngenius of art.\"\nRodolphe, meanwhile, with Madame Bovary, had gone up to the first floor of the town hall, to the\n\"council-room,\" and, as it was empty, he declared that they could enjoy the sight there more comfortably.\nHe fetched three stools from the round table under the bust of the monarch, and having carried them to\none of the windows, they sat down by each other.\nThere was commotion on the platform, long whisperings, much parleying. At last the councillor got up.\nThey knew now that his name was Lieuvain, and in the crowd the name was passed from one to the other.\nAfter he had collated a few pages, and bent over them to see better, he began--\n\"Gentlemen! May I be permitted first of all (before addressing you on the object of our meeting to-day,\nand this sentiment will, I am sure, be shared by you all), may I be permitted, I say, to pay a tribute to the\nhigher administration, to the government to the monarch, gentle men, our sovereign, to that beloved king,\nto whom no branch of public or private prosperity is a matter of indifference, and who directs with a hand\nat once so firm and wise the chariot of the state amid the incessant perils of a stormy sea, knowing,\nmoreover, how to make peace respected as well as war, industry, commerce, agriculture, and the fine\narts?\"\n\"I ought,\" said Rodolphe, \"to get back a little further.\"\n-76\n\n\"Why?\" said Emma.\nBut at this moment the voice of the councillor rose to an extraordinary pitch. He declaimed--\n\"This is no longer the time, gentlemen, when civil discord ensanguined our public places, when the\nlandlord, the business-man, the working-man himself, falling asleep at night, lying down to peaceful\nsleep, trembled lest he should be awakened suddenly by the noise of incendiary tocsins, when the most\nsubversive doctrines audaciously sapped foundations.\"\n\"Well, someone down there might see me,\" Rodolphe resumed, \"then I should have to invent excuses for\na fortnight; and with my bad reputation--\"\n\"Oh, you are slandering yourself,\" said Emma.\n\"No! It is dreadful, I assure you.\"\n\"But, gentlemen,\" continued the councillor, \"if, banishing from my memory the remembrance of these\nsad pictures, I carry my eyes back to the actual situation of our dear country, what do I see there?\nEverywhere commerce and the arts are flourishing; everywhere new means of communication, like so\nmany new arteries in the body of the state, establish within it new relations. Our great industrial centres\nhave recovered all their activity; religion, more consolidated, smiles in all hearts; our ports are full,\nconfidence is born again, and France breathes once more!\"\n\"Besides,\" added Rodolphe, \"perhaps from the world's point of view they are right.\"\n\"How so?\" she asked.\n\"What!\" said he. \"Do you not know that there are souls constantly tormented? They need by turns to\ndream and to act, the purest passions and the most turbulent joys, and thus they fling themselves into all\nsorts of fantasies, of follies.\"\nThen she looked at him as one looks at a traveller who has voyaged over strange lands, and went on--\n\"We have not even this distraction, we poor women!\"\n\"A sad distraction, for happiness isn't found in it.\"\n\"But is it ever found?\" she asked.\n\"Yes; one day it comes,\" he answered.\n\"And this is what you have understood,\" said the councillor.\n\"You, farmers, agricultural labourers! you pacific pioneers of a work that belongs wholly to civilization!\nyou, men of progress and morality, you have understood, I say, that political storms are even more\nredoubtable than atmospheric disturbances!\"\n\"It comes one day,\" repeated Rodolphe, \"one day suddenly, and when one is despairing of it. Then the\nhorizon expands; it is as if a voice cried, 'It is here!' You feel the need of confiding the whole of your\nlife, of giving everything, sacrificing everything to this being. There is no need for explanations; they\nunderstand one another. They have seen each other in dreams!\"\n-77\n\n(And he looked at her.) \"In fine, here it is, this treasure so sought after, here before you. It glitters, it\nflashes; yet one still doubts, one does not believe it; one remains dazzled, as if one went out iron darkness\ninto light.\"\nAnd as he ended Rodolphe suited the action to the word. He passed his hand over his face, like a man\nseized with giddiness. Then he let it fall on Emma's. She took hers away.\n\"And who would be surprised at it, gentlemen? He only who is so blind, so plunged (I do not fear to say\nit), so plunged in the prejudices of another age as still to misunderstand the spirit of agricultural\npopulations. Where, indeed, is to be found more patriotism than in the country, greater devotion to the\npublic welfare, more intelligence, in a word? And, gentlemen, I do not mean that superficial intelligence,\nvain ornament of idle minds, but rather that profound and balanced intelligence that applies itself above\nall else to useful objects, thus contributing to the good of all, to the common amelioration and to the\nsupport of the state, born of respect for law and the practice of duty--\"\n\"Ah! again!\" said Rodolphe. \"Always 'duty.' I am sick of the word. They are a lot of old blockheads in\nflannel vests and of old women with foot-warmers and rosaries who constantly drone into our ears 'Duty,\nduty!' Ah! by Jove! one's duty is to feel what is great, cherish the beautiful, and not accept all the\nconventions of society with the ignominy that it imposes upon us.\"\n\"Yet--yet--\" objected Madame Bovary.\n\"No, no! Why cry out against the passions? Are they not the one beautiful thing on the earth, the source\nof heroism, of enthusiasm, of poetry, music, the arts, of everything, in a word?\"\n\"But one must,\" said Emma, \"to some extent bow to the opinion of the world and accept its moral code.\"\n\"Ah! but there are two,\" he replied. \"The small, the conventional, that of men, that which constantly\nchanges, that brays out so loudly, that makes such a commotion here below, of the earth earthly, like the\nmass of imbeciles you see down there. But the other, the eternal, that is about us and above, like the\nlandscape that surrounds us, and the blue heavens that give us light.\"\nMonsieur Lieuvain had just wiped his mouth with a pocket-handkerchief. He continued--\n\"And what should I do here gentlemen, pointing out to you the uses of agriculture? Who supplies our\nwants? Who provides our means of subsistence? Is it not the agriculturist? The agriculturist, gentlemen,\nwho, sowing with laborious hand the fertile furrows of the country, brings forth the corn, which, being\nground, is made into a powder by means of ingenious machinery, comes out thence under the name of\nflour, and from there, transported to our cities, is soon delivered at the baker's, who makes it into food for\npoor and rich alike. Again, is it not the agriculturist who fattens, for our clothes, his abundant flocks in\nthe pastures? For how should we clothe ourselves, how nourish ourselves, without the agriculturist? And,\ngentlemen, is it even necessary to go so far for examples? Who has not frequently reflected on all the\nmomentous things that we get out of that modest animal, the ornament of poultry-yards, that provides us\nat once with a soft pillow for our bed, with succulent flesh for our tables, and eggs? But I should never\nend if I were to enumerate one after the other all the different products which the earth, well cultivated,\nlike a generous mother, lavishes upon her children. Here it is the vine, elsewhere the apple tree for cider,\nthere colza, farther on cheeses and flax. Gentlemen, let us not forget flax, which has made such great\nstrides of late years, and to which I will more particularly call your attention.\"\nHe had no need to call it, for all the mouths of the multitude were wide open, as if to drink in his words.\nTuvache by his side listened to him with staring eyes. Monsieur Derozerays from time to time softly\n-78\n\nclosed his eyelids, and farther on the chemist, with his son Napoleon between his knees, put his hand\nbehind his ear in order not to lose a syllable. The chins of the other members of the jury went slowly up\nand down in their waistcoats in sign of approval. The firemen at the foot of the platform rested on their\nbayonets; and Binet, motionless, stood with out-turned elbows, the point of his sabre in the air. Perhaps\nhe could hear, but certainly he could see nothing, because of the visor of his helmet, that fell down on his\nnose. His lieutenant, the youngest son of Monsieur Tuvache, had a bigger one, for his was enormous, and\nshook on his head, and from it an end of his cotton scarf peeped out. He smiled beneath it with a perfectly\ninfantine sweetness, and his pale little face, whence drops were running, wore an expression of enjoyment\nand sleepiness.\nThe square as far as the houses was crowded with people. One saw folk leaning on their elbows at all the\nwindows, others standing at doors, and Justin, in front of the chemist's shop, seemed quite transfixed by\nthe sight of what he was looking at. In spite of the silence Monsieur Lieuvain's voice was lost in the air. It\nreached you in fragments of phrases, and interrupted here and there by the creaking of chairs in the\ncrowd; then you suddenly heard the long bellowing of an ox, or else the bleating of the lambs, who\nanswered one another at street corners. In fact, the cowherds and shepherds had driven their beasts thus\nfar, and these lowed from time to time, while with their tongues they tore down some scrap of foliage that\nhung above their mouths.\nRodolphe had drawn nearer to Emma, and said to her in a low voice, speaking rapidly--\n\"Does not this conspiracy of the world revolt you? Is there a single sentiment it does not condemn? The\nnoblest instincts, the purest sympathies are persecuted, slandered; and if at length two poor souls do meet,\nall is so organised that they cannot blend together. Yet they will make the attempt; they will flutter their\nwings; they will call upon each other. Oh! no matter. Sooner or later, in six months, ten years, they will\ncome together, will love; for fate has decreed it, and they are born one for the other.\"\nHis arms were folded across his knees, and thus lifting his face towards Emma, close by her, he looked\nfixedly at her. She noticed in his eyes small golden lines radiating from black pupils; she even smelt the\nperfume of the pomade that made his hair glossy.\nThen a faintness came over her; she recalled the Viscount who had waltzed with her at Vaubyessard, and\nhis beard exhaled like this air an odour of vanilla and citron, and mechanically she half-closed her eyes\nthe better to breathe it in. But in making this movement, as she leant back in her chair, she saw in the\ndistance, right on the line of the horizon, the old diligence, the \"Hirondelle,\" that was slowly descending\nthe hill of Leux, dragging after it a long trail of dust. It was in this yellow carriage that Leon had so often\ncome back to her, and by this route down there that he had gone for ever. She fancied she saw him\nopposite at his windows; then all grew confused; clouds gathered; it seemed to her that she was again\nturning in the waltz under the light of the lustres on the arm of the Viscount, and that Leon was not far\naway, that he was coming; and yet all the time she was conscious of the scent of Rodolphe's head by her\nside. This sweetness of sensation pierced through her old desires, and these, like grains of sand under a\ngust of wind, eddied to and fro in the subtle breath of the perfume which suffused her soul. She opened\nwide her nostrils several times to drink in the freshness of the ivy round the capitals. She took off her\ngloves, she wiped her hands, then fanned her face with her handkerchief, while athwart the throbbing of\nher temples she heard the murmur of the crowd and the voice of the councillor intoning his phrases. He\nsaid--\"Continue, persevere; listen neither to the suggestions of routine, nor to the over-hasty councils of a\nrash empiricism.\n\"Apply yourselves, above all, to the amelioration of the soil, to good manures, to the development of the\nequine, bovine, ovine, and porcine races. Let these shows be to you pacific arenas, where the victor in\nleaving it will hold forth a hand to the vanquished, and will fraternise with him in the hope of better\n-79\n\nsuccess. And you, aged servants, humble domestics, whose hard labour no Government up to this day has\ntaken into consideration, come hither to receive the reward of your silent virtues, and be assured that the\nstate henceforward has its eye upon you; that it encourages you, protects you; that it will accede to your\njust demands, and alleviate as much as in it lies the burden of your painful sacrifices.\"\nMonsieur Lieuvain then sat down; Monsieur Derozerays got up, beginning another speech. His was not\nperhaps so florid as that of the councillor, but it recommended itself by a more direct style, that is to say,\nby more special knowledge and more elevated considerations. Thus the praise of the Government took up\nless space in it; religion and agriculture more. He showed in it the relations of these two, and how they\nhad always contributed to civilisation. Rodolphe with Madame Bovary was talking dreams,\npresentiments, magnetism. Going back to the cradle of society, the orator painted those fierce times when\nmen lived on acorns in the heart of woods. Then they had left off the skins of beasts, had put on cloth,\ntilled the soil, planted the vine. Was this a good, and in this discovery was there not more of injury than of\ngain? Monsieur Derozerays set himself this problem. From magnetism little by little Rodolphe had come\nto affinities, and while the president was citing Cincinnatus and his plough, Diocletian, planting his\ncabbages, and the Emperors of China inaugurating the year by the sowing of seed, the young man was\nexplaining to the young woman that these irresistible attractions find their cause in some previous state of\nexistence.\n\"Thus we,\" he said, \"why did we come to know one another? What chance willed it? It was because\nacross the infinite, like two streams that flow but to unite; our special bents of mind had driven us towards\neach other.\"\nAnd he seized her hand; she did not withdraw it.\n\"For good farming generally!\" cried the president.\n\"Just now, for example, when I went to your house.\"\n\"To Monsieur Bizat of Quincampoix.\"\n\"Did I know I should accompany you?\"\n\"Seventy francs.\"\n\"A hundred times I wished to go; and I followed you--I remained.\"\n\"Manures!\"\n\"And I shall remain to-night, to-morrow, all other days, all my life!\"\n\"To Monsieur Caron of Argueil, a gold medal!\"\n\"For I have never in the society of any other person found so complete a charm.\"\n\"To Monsieur Bain of Givry-Saint-Martin.\"\n\"And I shall carry away with me the remembrance of you.\"\n\"For a merino ram!\"\n-80\n\n\"But you will forget me; I shall pass away like a shadow.\"\n\"To Monsieur Belot of Notre-Dame.\"\n\"Oh, no! I shall be something in your thought, in your life, shall I not?\"\n\"Porcine race; prizes--equal, to Messrs. Leherisse and Cullembourg, sixty francs!\"\nRodolphe was pressing her hand, and he felt it all warm and quivering like a captive dove that wants to\nfly away; but, whether she was trying to take it away or whether she was answering his pressure; she\nmade a movement with her fingers. He exclaimed--\n\"Oh, I thank you! You do not repulse me! You are good! You understand that I am yours! Let me look at\nyou; let me contemplate you!\"\nA gust of wind that blew in at the window ruffled the cloth on the table, and in the square below all the\ngreat caps of the peasant women were uplifted by it like the wings of white butterflies fluttering.\n\"Use of oil-cakes,\" continued the president. He was hurrying on: \"Flemish\nmanure-flax-growing-drainage-long leases-domestic service.\"\nRodolphe was no longer speaking. They looked at one another. A supreme desire made their dry lips\ntremble, and wearily, without an effort, their fingers intertwined.\n\"Catherine Nicaise Elizabeth Leroux, of Sassetot-la-Guerriere, for fifty-four years of service at the same\nfarm, a silver medal--value, twenty-five francs!\"\n\"Where is Catherine Leroux?\" repeated the councillor.\nShe did not present herself, and one could hear voices whispering--\n\"Go up!\"\n\"Don't be afraid!\"\n\"Oh, how stupid she is!\"\n\"Well, is she there?\" cried Tuvache.\n\"Yes; here she is.\"\n\"Then let her come up!\"\nThen there came forward on the platform a little old woman with timid bearing, who seemed to shrink\nwithin her poor clothes. On her feet she wore heavy wooden clogs, and from her hips hung a large blue\napron. Her pale face framed in a borderless cap was more wrinkled than a withered russet apple. And\nfrom the sleeves of her red jacket looked out two large hands with knotty joints, the dust of barns, the\npotash of washing the grease of wools had so encrusted, roughened, hardened these that they seemed\ndirty, although they had been rinsed in clear water; and by dint of long service they remained half open,\nas if to bear humble witness for themselves of so much suffering endured. Something of monastic rigidity\ndignified her face. Nothing of sadness or of emotion weakened that pale look. In her constant living with\n-81\n\nanimals she had caught their dumbness and their calm. It was the first time that she found herself in the\nmidst of so large a company, and inwardly scared by the flags, the drums, the gentlemen in frock-coats,\nand the order of the councillor, she stood motionless, not knowing whether to advance or run away, nor\nwhy the crowd was pushing her and the jury were smiling at her.\nThus stood before these radiant bourgeois this half-century of servitude.\n\"Approach, venerable Catherine Nicaise Elizabeth Leroux!\" said the councillor, who had taken the list of\nprize-winners from the president; and, looking at the piece of paper and the old woman by turns, he\nrepeated in a fatherly tone--\"Approach! approach!\"\n\"Are you deaf?\" said Tuvache, fidgeting in his armchair; and he began shouting in her ear, \"Fifty-four\nyears of service. A silver medal! Twenty-five francs! For you!\"\nThen, when she had her medal, she looked at it, and a smile of beatitude spread over her face; and as she\nwalked away they could hear her muttering \"I'll give it to our cure up home, to say some masses for me!\"\n\"What fanaticism!\" exclaimed the chemist, leaning across to the notary.\nThe meeting was over, the crowd dispersed, and now that the speeches had been read, each one fell back\ninto his place again, and everything into the old grooves; the masters bullied the servants, and these struck\nthe animals, indolent victors, going back to the stalls, a green-crown on their horns.\nThe National Guards, however, had gone up to the first floor of the town hall with buns spitted on their\nbayonets, and the drummer of the battalion carried a basket with bottles. Madame Bovary took\nRodolphe's arm; he saw her home; they separated at her door; then he walked about alone in the meadow\nwhile he waited for the time of the banquet.\nThe feast was long, noisy, ill served; the guests were so crowded that they could hardly move their\nelbows; and the narrow planks used for forms almost broke down under their weight. They ate hugely.\nEach one stuffed himself on his own account. Sweat stood on every brow, and a whitish steam, like the\nvapour of a stream on an autumn morning, floated above the table between the hanging lamps. Rodolphe,\nleaning against the calico of the tent was thinking so earnestly of Emma that he heard nothing. Behind\nhim on the grass the servants were piling up the dirty plates, his neighbours were talking; he did not\nanswer them; they filled his glass, and there was silence in his thoughts in spite of the growing noise. He\nwas dreaming of what she had said, of the line of her lips; her face, as in a magic mirror, shone on the\nplates of the shakos, the folds of her gown fell along the walls, and days of love unrolled to all infinity\nbefore him in the vistas of the future.\nHe saw her again in the evening during the fireworks, but she was with her husband, Madame Homais,\nand the druggist, who was worrying about the danger of stray rockets, and every moment he left the\ncompany to go and give some advice to Binet.\nThe pyrotechnic pieces sent to Monsieur Tuvache had, through an excess of caution, been shut up in his\ncellar, and so the damp powder would not light, and the principal set piece, that was to represent a dragon\nbiting his tail, failed completely. Now and then a meagre Roman-candle went off; then the gaping crowd\nsent up a shout that mingled with the cry of the women, whose waists were being squeezed in the\ndarkness. Emma silently nestled against Charles's shoulder; then, raising her chin, she watched the\nluminous rays of the rockets against the dark sky. Rodolphe gazed at her in the light of the burning\nlanterns.\n-82\n\nThey went out one by one. The stars shone out. A few crops of rain began to fall. She knotted her fichu\nround her bare head.\nAt this moment the councillor's carriage came out from the inn.\nHis coachman, who was drunk, suddenly dozed off, and one could see from the distance, above the hood,\nbetween the two lanterns, the mass of his body, that swayed from right to left with the giving of the\ntraces.\n\"Truly,\" said the druggist, \"one ought to proceed most rigorously against drunkenness! I should like to\nsee written up weekly at the door of the town hall on a board ad hoc[13] the names of all those who\nduring the week got intoxicated on alcohol. Besides, with regard to statistics, one would thus have, as it\nwere, public records that one could refer to in case of need. But excuse me!\"\n[13]Specifically for that.\nAnd he once more ran off to the captain. The latter was going back to see his lathe again.\n\"Perhaps you would not do ill,\" Homais said to him, \"to send one of your men, or to go yourself--\"\n\"Leave me alone!\" answered the tax-collector. \"It's all right!\"\n\"Do not be uneasy,\" said the druggist, when he returned to his friends. \"Monsieur Binet has assured me\nthat all precautions have been taken. No sparks have fallen; the pumps are full. Let us go to rest.\"\n\"Ma foi! I want it,\" said Madame Homais, yawning at large. \"But never mind; we've had a beautiful day\nfor our fete.\"\nRodolphe repeated in a low voice, and with a tender look, \"Oh, yes! very beautiful!\"\nAnd having bowed to one another, they separated.\nTwo days later, in the \"Final de Rouen,\" there was a long article on the show. Homais had composed it\nwith verve the very next morning.\n\"Why these festoons, these flowers, these garlands? Whither hurries this crowd like the waves of a\nfurious sea under the torrents of a tropical sun pouring its heat upon our heads?\"\nThen he spoke of the condition of the peasants. Certainly the Government was doing much, but not\nenough. \"Courage!\" he cried to it; \"a thousand reforms are indispensable; let us accomplish them!\" Then\ntouching on the entry of the councillor, he did not forget \"the martial air of our militia;\" nor \"our most\nmerry village maidens;\" nor the \"bald-headed old men like patriarchs who were there, and of whom some,\nthe remnants of our phalanxes, still felt their hearts beat at the manly sound of the drums.\" He cited\nhimself among the first of the members of the jury, and he even called attention in a note to the fact that\nMonsieur Homais, chemist, had sent a memoir on cider to the agricultural society.\nWhen he came to the distribution of the prizes, he painted the joy of the prize-winners in dithyrambic\nstrophes. \"The father embraced the son, the brother the brother, the husband his consort. More than one\nshowed his humble medal with pride; and no doubt when he got home to his good housewife, he hung it\nup weeping on the modest walls of his cot.\n-83\n\n\"About six o'clock a banquet prepared in the meadow of Monsieur Leigeard brought together the\nprincipal personages of the fete. The greatest cordiality reigned here. Divers toasts were proposed:\nMonsieur Lieuvain, the King; Monsieur Tuvache, the Prefect; Monsieur Derozerays, Agriculture;\nMonsieur Homais, Industry and the Fine Arts, those twin sisters; Monsieur Leplichey, Progress. In the\nevening some brilliant fireworks on a sudden illumined the air. One would have called it a veritable\nkaleidoscope, a real operatic scene; and for a moment our little locality might have thought itself\ntransported into the midst of a dream of the 'Thousand and One Nights.' \"Let us state that no untoward\nevent disturbed this family meeting.\" And he added \"Only the absence of the clergy was remarked. No\ndoubt the priests understand progress in another fashion. Just as you please, messieurs the followers of\nLoyola!\"\nChapter Nine\nSix weeks passed. Rodolphe did not come again. At last one evening he appeared.\nThe day after the show he had said to himself--\"We mustn't go back too soon; that would be a mistake.\"\nAnd at the end of a week he had gone off hunting. After the hunting he had thought it was too late, and\nthen he reasoned thus--\n\"If from the first day she loved me, she must from impatience to see me again love me more. Let's go on\nwith it!\"\nAnd he knew that his calculation had been right when, on entering the room, he saw Emma turn pale.\nShe was alone. The day was drawing in. The small muslin curtain along the windows deepened the\ntwilight, and the gilding of the barometer, on which the rays of the sun fell, shone in the looking-glass\nbetween the meshes of the coral.\nRodolphe remained standing, and Emma hardly answered his first conventional phrases.\n\"I,\" he said, \"have been busy. I have been ill.\"\n\"Seriously?\" she cried.\n\"Well,\" said Rodolphe, sitting down at her side on a footstool, \"no; it was because I did not want to come\nback.\"\n\"Why?\"\n\"Can you not guess?\"\nHe looked at her again, but so hard that she lowered her head, blushing. He went on--\n\"Emma!\"\n\"Sir,\" she said, drawing back a little.\n\"Ah! you see,\" replied he in a melancholy voice, \"that I was right not to come back; for this name, this\nname that fills my whole soul, and that escaped me, you forbid me to use! Madame Bovary! why all the\nworld calls you thus! Besides, it is not your name; it is the name of another!\"\n-84\n\nHe repeated, \"of another!\" And he hid his face in his hands.\n\"Yes, I think of you constantly. The memory of you drives me to despair. Ah! forgive me! I will leave\nyou! Farewell! I will go far away, so far that you will never hear of me again; and yet-- to-day--I know\nnot what force impelled me towards you. For one does not struggle against Heaven; one cannot resist the\nsmile of angels; one is carried away by that which is beautiful, charming, adorable.\"\nIt was the first time that Emma had heard such words spoken to herself, and her pride, like one who\nreposes bathed in warmth, expanded softly and fully at this glowing language.\n\"But if I did not come,\" he continued, \"if I could not see you, at least I have gazed long on all that\nsurrounds you. At night-every night-I arose; I came hither; I watched your house, its glimmering in the\nmoon, the trees in the garden swaying before your window, and the little lamp, a gleam shining through\nthe window-panes in the darkness. Ah! you never knew that there, so near you, so far from you, was a\npoor wretch!\"\nShe turned towards him with a sob.\n\"Oh, you are good!\" she said.\n\"No, I love you, that is all! You do not doubt that! Tell me--one word--only one word!\"\nAnd Rodolphe imperceptibly glided from the footstool to the ground; but a sound of wooden shoes was\nheard in the kitchen, and he noticed the door of the room was not closed.\n\"How kind it would be of you,\" he went on, rising, \"if you would humour a whim of mine.\" It was to go\nover her house; he wanted to know it; and Madame Bovary seeing no objection to this, they both rose,\nwhen Charles came in.\n\"Good morning, doctor,\" Rodolphe said to him.\nThe doctor, flattered at this unexpected title, launched out into obsequious phrases. Of this the other took\nadvantage to pull himself together a little.\n\"Madame was speaking to me,\" he then said, \"about her health.\"\nCharles interrupted him; he had indeed a thousand anxieties; his wife's palpitations of the heart were\nbeginning again. Then Rodolphe asked if riding would not be good.\n\"Certainly! excellent! just the thing! There's an idea! You ought to follow it up.\"\nAnd as she objected that she had no horse, Monsieur Rodolphe offered one. She refused his offer; he did\nnot insist. Then to explain his visit he said that his ploughman, the man of the blood-letting, still suffered\nfrom giddiness.\n\"I'll call around,\" said Bovary.\n\"No, no! I'll send him to you; we'll come; that will be more convenient for you.\"\n\"Ah! very good! I thank you.\"\n-85\n\nAnd as soon as they were alone, \"Why don't you accept Monsieur Boulanger's kind offer?\"\nShe assumed a sulky air, invented a thousand excuses, and finally declared that perhaps it would look\nodd.\n\"Well, what the deuce do I care for that?\" said Charles, making a pirouette. \"Health before everything!\nYou are wrong.\"\n\"And how do you think I can ride when I haven't got a habit?\"\n\"You must order one,\" he answered.\nThe riding-habit decided her.\nWhen the habit was ready, Charles wrote to Monsieur Boulanger that his wife was at his command, and\nthat they counted on his good-nature.\nThe next day at noon Rodolphe appeared at Charles's door with two saddle-horses. One had pink rosettes\nat his ears and a deerskin side-saddle.\nRodolphe had put on high soft boots, saying to himself that no doubt she had never seen anything like\nthem. In fact, Emma was charmed with his appearance as he stood on the landing in his great velvet coat\nand white corduroy breeches. She was ready; she was waiting for him.\nJustin escaped from the chemist's to see her start, and the chemist also came out. He was giving Monsieur\nBoulanger a little good advice.\n\"An accident happens so easily. Be careful! Your horses perhaps are mettlesome.\"\nShe heard a noise above her; it was Felicite drumming on the windowpanes to amuse little Berthe. The\nchild blew her a kiss; her mother answered with a wave of her whip.\n\"A pleasant ride!\" cried Monsieur Homais. \"Prudence! above all, prudence!\" And he flourished his\nnewspaper as he saw them disappear.\nAs soon as he felt the ground, Emma's horse set off at a gallop.\nRodolphe galloped by her side. Now and then they exchanged a word. Her figure slightly bent, her hand\nwell up, and her right arm stretched out, she gave herself up to the cadence of the movement that rocked\nher in her saddle. At the bottom of the hill Rodolphe gave his horse its head; they started together at a\nbound, then at the top suddenly the horses stopped, and her large blue veil fell about her.\nIt was early in October. There was fog over the land. Hazy clouds hovered on the horizon between the\noutlines of the hills; others, rent asunder, floated up and disappeared. Sometimes through a rift in the\nclouds, beneath a ray of sunshine, gleamed from afar the roots of Yonville, with the gardens at the water's\nedge, the yards, the walls and the church steeple. Emma half closed her eyes to pick out her house, and\nnever had this poor village where she lived appeared so small. From the height on which they were the\nwhole valley seemed an immense pale lake sending off its vapour into the air. Clumps of trees here and\nthere stood out like black rocks, and the tall lines of the poplars that rose above the mist were like a beach\nstirred by the wind.\n-86\n\nBy the side, on the turf between the pines, a brown light shimmered in the warm atmosphere. The earth,\nruddy like the powder of tobacco, deadened the noise of their steps, and with the edge of their shoes the\nhorses as they walked kicked the fallen fir cones in front of them.\nRodolphe and Emma thus went along the skirt of the wood. She turned away from time to time to avoid\nhis look, and then she saw only the pine trunks in lines, whose monotonous succession made her a little\ngiddy. The horses were panting; the leather of the saddles creaked.\nJust as they were entering the forest the sun shone out.\n\"God protects us!\" said Rodolphe.\n\"Do you think so?\" she said.\n\"Forward! forward!\" he continued.\nHe \"tchk'd\" with his tongue. The two beasts set off at a trot.\nLong ferns by the roadside caught in Emma's stirrup.\nRodolphe leant forward and removed them as they rode along. At other times, to turn aside the branches,\nhe passed close to her, and Emma felt his knee brushing against her leg. The sky was now blue, the leaves\nno longer stirred. There were spaces full of heather in flower, and plots of violets alternated with the\nconfused patches of the trees that were grey, fawn, or golden coloured, according to the nature of their\nleaves. Often in the thicket was heard the fluttering of wings, or else the hoarse, soft cry of the ravens\nflying off amidst the oaks.\nThey dismounted. Rodolphe fastened up the horses. She walked on in front on the moss between the\npaths. But her long habit got in her way, although she held it up by the skirt; and Rodolphe, walking\nbehind her, saw between the black cloth and the black shoe the fineness of her white stocking, that\nseemed to him as if it were a part of her nakedness.\nShe stopped. \"I am tired,\" she said.\n\"Come, try again,\" he went on. \"Courage!\"\nThen some hundred paces farther on she again stopped, and through her veil, that fell sideways from her\nman's hat over her hips, her face appeared in a bluish transparency as if she were floating under azure\nwaves.\n\"But where are we going?\"\nHe did not answer. She was breathing irregularly. Rodolphe looked round him biting his moustache. They\ncame to a larger space where the coppice had been cut. They sat down on the trunk of a fallen tree, and\nRodolphe began speaking to her of his love. He did not begin by frightening her with compliments. He\nwas calm, serious, melancholy.\nEmma listened to him with bowed head, and stirred the bits of wood on the ground with the tip of her\nfoot. But at the words, \"Are not our destinies now one?\"\n\"Oh, no! she replied. \"You know that well. It is impossible!\" She rose to go. He seized her by the wrist.\n-87\n\nShe stopped. Then, having gazed at him for a few moments with an amorous and humid look, she said\nhurriedly--\n\"Ah! do not speak of it again! Where are the horses? Let us go back.\"\nHe made a gesture of anger and annoyance. She repeated:\n\"Where are the horses? Where are the horses?\"\nThen smiling a strange smile, his pupil fixed, his teeth set, he advanced with outstretched arms. She\nrecoiled trembling. She stammered:\n\"Oh, you frighten me! You hurt me! Let me go!\"\n\"If it must be,\" he went on, his face changing; and he again became respectful, caressing, timid. She gave\nhim her arm. They went back. He said--\n\"What was the matter with you? Why? I do not understand. You were mistaken, no doubt. In my soul you\nare as a Madonna on a pedestal, in a place lofty, secure, immaculate. But I need you to live! I must have\nyour eyes, your voice, your thought! Be my friend, my sister, my angel!\"\nAnd he put out his arm round her waist. She feebly tried to disengage herself. He supported her thus as\nthey walked along.\nBut they heard the two horses browsing on the leaves.\n\"Oh! one moment!\" said Rodolphe. \"Do not let us go! Stay!\"\nHe drew her farther on to a small pool where duckweeds made a greenness on the water. Faded water\nlilies lay motionless between the reeds. At the noise of their steps in the grass, frogs jumped away to hide\nthemselves.\n\"I am wrong! I am wrong!\" she said. \"I am mad to listen to you!\"\n\"Why? Emma! Emma!\"\n\"Oh, Rodolphe!\" said the young woman slowly, leaning on his shoulder.\nThe cloth of her habit caught against the velvet of his coat. She threw back her white neck, swelling with\na sigh, and faltering, in tears, with a long shudder and hiding her face, she gave herself up to him--\nThe shades of night were falling; the horizontal sun passing between the branches dazzled the eyes. Here\nand there around her, in the leaves or on the ground, trembled luminous patches, as it hummingbirds\nflying about had scattered their feathers. Silence was everywhere; something sweet seemed to come forth\nfrom the trees; she felt her heart, whose beating had begun again, and the blood coursing through her\nflesh like a stream of milk. Then far away, beyond the wood, on the other hills, she heard a vague\nprolonged cry, a voice which lingered, and in silence she heard it mingling like music with the last\npulsations of her throbbing nerves. Rodolphe, a cigar between his lips, was mending with his penknife\none of the two broken bridles.\nThey returned to Yonville by the same road. On the mud they saw again the traces of their horses side by\n-88\n\nside, the same thickets, the same stones to the grass; nothing around them seemed changed; and yet for\nher something had happened more stupendous than if the mountains had moved in their places. Rodolphe\nnow and again bent forward and took her hand to kiss it.\nShe was charming on horseback--upright, with her slender waist, her knee bent on the mane of her horse,\nher face somewhat flushed by the fresh air in the red of the evening.\nOn entering Yonville she made her horse prance in the road. People looked at her from the windows.\nAt dinner her husband thought she looked well, but she pretended not to hear him when he inquired about\nher ride, and she remained sitting there with her elbow at the side of her plate between the two lighted\ncandles.\n\"Emma!\" he said.\n\"What?\"\n\"Well, I spent the afternoon at Monsieur Alexandre's. He has an old cob, still very fine, only a little\nbrokenkneed, and that could be bought; I am sure, for a hundred crowns.\" He added, \"And thinking it\nmight please you, I have bespoken it--bought it. Have I done right? Do tell me?\"\nShe nodded her head in assent; then a quarter of an hour later--\n\"Are you going out to-night?\" she asked.\n\"Yes. Why?\"\n\"Oh, nothing, nothing, my dear!\"\nAnd as soon as she had got rid of Charles she went and shut herself up in her room.\nAt first she felt stunned; she saw the trees, the paths, the ditches, Rodolphe, and she again felt the pressure\nof his arm, while the leaves rustled and the reeds whistled.\nBut when she saw herself in the glass she wondered at her face. Never had her eyes been so large, so\nblack, of so profound a depth. Something subtle about her being transfigured her. She repeated, \"I have a\nlover! a lover!\" delighting at the idea as if a second puberty had come to her. So at last she was to know\nthose joys of love, that fever of happiness of which she had despairedl She was entering upon marvels\nwhere all would be passion, ecstasy, delirium. An azure infinity encompassed her, the heights of\nsentiment sparkled under her thought, and ordinary existence appeared only afar off, down below in the\nshade, through the interspaces of these heights.\nThen she recalled the heroines of the books that she had read, and the lyric legion of these adulterous\nwomen began to sing in her memory with the voice of sisters that charmed her. She became herself, as it\nwere, an actual part of these imaginings, and realised the love-dream of her youth as she saw herself in\nthis type of amorous women whom she had so envied. Besides, Emma felt a satisfaction of revenge. Had\nshe not suffered enough? But now she triumphed, and the love so long pent up burst forth in full joyous\nbubblings. She tasted it without remorse, without anxiety, without trouble.\nThe day following passed with a new sweetness. They made vows to one another She told him of her\nsorrows. Rodolphe interrupted her with kisses; and she looking at him through half-closed eyes, asked\n-89\n\nhim to call her again by her name--to say that he loved her They were in the forest, as yesterday, in the\nshed of some woodenshoe maker. The walls were of straw, and the roof so low they had to stoop. They\nwere seated side by side on a bed of dry leaves.\nFrom that day forth they wrote to one another regularly every evening. Emma placed her letter at the end\nof the garden, by the river, in a fissure of the wall. Rodolphe came to fetch it, and put another there, that\nshe always found fault with as too short.\nOne morning, when Charles had gone out before day break, she was seized with the fancy to see\nRodolphe at once. She would go quickly to La Huchette, stay there an hour, and be back again at Yonville\nwhile everyone was still asleep. This idea made her pant with desire, and she soon found herself in the\nmiddle of the field, walking with rapid steps, without looking behind her.\nDay was just breaking. Emma from afar recognised her lover's house. Its two dove-tailed weathercocks\nstood out black against the pale dawn.\nBeyond the farmyard there was a detached building that she thought must be the chateau She entered--it\nwas if the doors at her approach had opened wide of their own accord. A large straight staircase led up to\nthe corridor. Emma raised the latch of a door, and suddenly at the end of the room she saw a man\nsleeping. It was Rodolphe. She uttered a cry.\n\"You here? You here?\" he repeated. \"How did you manage to come? Ah! your dress is damp.\"\n\"I love you,\" she answered, throwing her arms about his neck.\nThis first piece of daring successful, now every time Charles went out early Emma dressed quickly and\nslipped on tiptoe down the steps that led to the waterside.\nBut when the plank for the cows was taken up, she had to go by the walls alongside of the river; the bank\nwas slippery; in order not to fall she caught hold of the tufts of faded wallflowers. Then she went across\nploughed fields, in which she sank, stumbling; and clogging her thin shoes. Her scarf, knotted round her\nhead, fluttered to the wind in the meadows. She was afraid of the oxen; she began to run; she arrived out\nof breath, with rosy cheeks, and breathing out from her whole person a fresh perfume of sap, of verdure,\nof the open air. At this hour Rodolphe still slept. It was like a spring morning coming into his room.\nThe yellow curtains along the windows let a heavy, whitish light enter softly. Emma felt about, opening\nand closing her eyes, while the drops of dew hanging from her hair formed, as it were, a topaz aureole\naround her face. Rodolphe, laughing, drew her to him, and pressed her to his breast.\nThen she examined the apartment, opened the drawers of the tables, combed her hair with his comb, and\nlooked at herself in his shaving-glass. Often she even put between her teeth the big pipe that lay on the\ntable by the bed, amongst lemons and pieces of sugar near a bottle of water.\nIt took them a good quarter of an hour to say goodbye. Then Emma cried. She would have wished never\nto leave Rodolphe. Something stronger than herself forced her to him; so much so, that one day, seeing\nher come unexpectedly, he frowned as one put out.\n\"What is the matter with you?\" she said. \"Are you ill? Tell me!\"\nAt last he declared with a serious air that her visits were becoming imprudent--that she was\ncompromising herself.\n-90\n\nChapter Ten\nGradually Rodolphe's fears took possession of her. At first, love had intoxicated her; and she had thought\nof nothing beyond. But now that he was indispensable to her life, she feared to lose anything of this, or\neven that it should be disturbed. When she came back from his house she looked all about her, anxiously\nwatching every form that passed in the horizon, and every village window from which she could be seen.\nShe listened for steps, cries, the noise of the ploughs, and she stopped short, white, and trembling more\nthan the aspen leaves swaying overhead.\nOne morning as she was thus returning, she suddenly thought she saw the long barrel of a carbine that\nseemed to be aimed at her. It stuck out sideways from the end of a small tub half-buried in the grass on\nthe edge of a ditch. Emma, half-fainting with terror, nevertheless walked on, and a man stepped out of the\ntub like a Jack-in-the-box. He had gaiters buckled up to the knees, his cap pulled down over his eyes,\ntrembling lips, and a red nose. It was Captain Binet lying in ambush for wild ducks.\n\"You ought to have called out long ago!\" he exclaimed; \"When one sees a gun, one should always give\nwarning.\"\nThe tax-collector was thus trying to hide the fright he had had, for a prefectorial order having prohibited\nduckhunting except in boats, Monsieur Binet, despite his respect for the laws, was infringing them, and so\nhe every moment expected to see the rural guard turn up. But this anxiety whetted his pleasure, and, all\nalone in his tub, he congratulated himself on his luck and on his cuteness. At sight of Emma he seemed\nrelieved from a great weight, and at once entered upon a conversation.\n\"It isn't warm; it's nipping.\"\nEmma answered nothing. He went on--\n\"And you're out so early?\"\n\"Yes,\" she said stammering; \"I am just coming from the nurse where my child is.\"\n\"Ah! very good! very good! For myself, I am here, just as you see me, since break of day; but the weather\nis so muggy, that unless one had the bird at the mouth of the gun--\"\n\"Good evening, Monsieur Binet,\" she interrupted him, turning on her heel.\n\"Your servant, madame,\" he replied drily; and he went back into his tub.\nEmma regretted having left the tax-collector so abruptly. No doubt he would form unfavourable\nconjectures. The story about the nurse was the worst possible excuse, everyone at Yonville knowing that\nthe little Bovary had been at home with her parents for a year. Besides, no one was living in this\ndirection; this path led only to La Huchette. Binet, then, would guess whence she came, and he would not\nkeep silence; he would talk, that was certain. She remained until evening racking her brain with every\nconceivable lying project, and had constantly before her eyes that imbecile with the game-bag.\nCharles after dinner, seeing her gloomy, proposed, by way of distraction, to take her to the chemist's, and\nthe first person she caught sight of in the shop was the taxcollector again. He was standing in front of the\ncounter, lit up by the gleams of the red bottle, and was saying--\n\"Please give me half an ounce of vitriol.\"\n-91\n\n\"Justin,\" cried the druggist, \"bring us the sulphuric acid.\" Then to Emma, who was going up to Madame\nHomais' room, \"No, stay here; it isn't worth while going up; she is just coming down. Warm yourself at\nthe stove in the meantime. Excuse me. Good-day, doctor,\" (for the chemist much enjoyed pronouncing\nthe word \"doctor,\" as if addressing another by it reflected on himself some of the grandeur that he found\nin it). \"Now, take care not to upset the mortars! You'd better fetch some chairs from the little room; you\nknow very well that the arm-chairs are not to be taken out of the drawing-room.\"\nAnd to put his arm-chair back in its place he was darting away from the counter, when Binet asked him\nfor half an ounce of sugar acid.\n\"Sugar acid!\" said the chemist contemptuously, \"don't know it; I'm ignorant of it! But perhaps you want\noxalic acid. It is oxalic acid, isn't it?\"\nBinet explained that he wanted a corrosive to make himself some copperwater with which to remove rust\nfrom his hunting things.\nEmma shuddered. The chemist began saying--\n\"Indeed the weather is not propitious on account of the damp.\"\n\"Nevertheless,\" replied the tax-collector, with a sly look, \"there are people who like it.\"\nShe was stifling.\n\"And give me--\"\n\"Will he never go?\" thought she.\n\"Half an ounce of resin and turpentine, four ounces of yellow wax, and three half ounces of animal\ncharcoal, if you please, to clean the varnished leather of my togs.\"\nThe druggist was beginning to cut the wax when Madame Homais appeared, Irma in her arms, Napoleon\nby her side, and Athalie following. She sat down on the velvet seat by the window, and the lad squatted\ndown on a footstool, while his eldest sister hovered round the jujube box near her papa. The latter was\nfilling funnels and corking phials, sticking on labels, making up parcels. Around him all were silent; only\nfrom time to time, were heard the weights jingling in the balance, and a few low words from the chemist\ngiving directions to his pupil.\n\"And how's the little woman?\" suddenly asked Madame Homais.\n\"Silence!\" exclaimed her husband, who was writing down some figures in his waste-book.\n\"Why didn't you bring her?\" she went on in a low voice.\n\"Hush! hush!\" said Emma, pointing with her finger to the druggist.\nBut Binet, quite absorbed in looking over his bill, had probably heard nothing. At last he went out. Then\nEmma, relieved, uttered a deep sigh.\n\"How hard you are breathing!\" said Madame Homais.\n-92\n\n\"Well, you see, it's rather warm,\" she replied.\nSo the next day they talked over how to arrange their rendezvous. Emma wanted to bribe her servant with\na present, but it would be better to find some safe house at Yonville. Rodolphe promised to look for one.\nAll through the winter, three or four times a week, in the dead of night he came to the garden. Emma had\non purpose taken away the key of the gate, which Charles thought lost.\nTo call her, Rodolphe threw a sprinkle of sand at the shutters. She jumped up with a start; but sometimes\nhe had to wait, for Charles had a mania for chatting by the fireside, and he would not stop. She was wild\nwith impatience; if her eyes could have done it, she would have hurled him out at the window. At last she\nwould begin to undress, then take up a book, and go on reading very quietly as if the book amused her.\nBut Charles, who was in bed, called to her to come too.\n\"Come, now, Emma,\" he said, \"it is time.\"\n\"Yes, I am coming,\" she answered.\nThen, as the candles dazzled him; he turned to the wall and fell asleep. She escaped, smiling, palpitating,\nundressed. Rodolphe had a large cloak; he wrapped her in it, and putting his arm round her waist, he drew\nher without a word to the end of the garden.\nIt was in the arbour, on the same seat of old sticks where formerly Leon had looked at her so amorously\non the summer evenings. She never thought of him now.\nThe stars shone through the leafless jasmine branches. Behind them they heard the river flowing, and now\nand again on the bank the rustling of the dry reeds. Masses of shadow here and there loomed out in the\ndarkness, and sometimes, vibrating with one movement, they rose up and swayed like immense black\nwaves pressing forward to engulf them. The cold of the nights made them clasp closer; the sighs of their\nlips seemed to them deeper; their eyes that they could hardly see, larger; and in the midst of the silence\nlow words were spoken that fell on their souls sonorous, crystalline, and that reverberated in multiplied\nvibrations.\nWhen the night was rainy, they took refuge in the consulting-room between the cart-shed and the stable.\nShe lighted one of the kitchen candles that she had hidden behind the books. Rodolphe settled down there\nas if at home. The sight of the library, of the bureau, of the whole apartment, in fine, excited his\nmerriment, and he could not refrain from making jokes about Charles, which rather embarrassed Emma.\nShe would have liked to see him more serious, and even on occasions more dramatic; as, for example,\nwhen she thought she heard a noise of approaching steps in the alley.\n\"Someone is coming!\" she said.\nHe blew out the light.\n\"Have you your pistols?\"\n\"Why?\"\n\"Why, to defend yourself,\" replied Emma.\n\"From your husband? Oh, poor devil!\" And Rodolphe finished his sentence with a gesture that said, \"I\n-93\n\ncould crush him with a flip of my finger.\"\nShe was wonder-stricken at his bravery, although she felt in it a sort of indecency and a naive coarseness\nthat scandalised her.\nRodolphe reflected a good deal on the affair of the pistols. If she had spoken seriously, it was very\nridiculous, he thought, even odious; for he had no reason to hate the good Charles, not being what is\ncalled devoured by jealousy; and on this subject Emma had taken a great vow that he did not think in the\nbest of taste.\nBesides, she was growing very sentimental. She had insisted on exchanging miniatures; they had cut off\nhandfuls of hair, and now she was asking for a ring--a real wedding-ring, in sign of an eternal union. She\noften spoke to him of the evening chimes, of the voices of nature. Then she talked to him of her\nmother--hers! and of his mother--his! Rodolphe had lost his twenty years ago. Emma none the less\nconsoled him with caressing words as one would have done a lost child, and she sometimes even said to\nhim, gazing at the moon\n\"I am sure that above there together they approve of our love.\"\nBut she was so pretty. He had possessed so few women of such ingenuousness. This love without\ndebauchery was a new experience for him, and, drawing him out of his lazy habits, caressed at once his\npride and his sensuality. Emma's enthusiasm, which his bourgeois good sense disdained, seemed to him\nin his heart of hearts charming, since it was lavished on him. Then, sure of being loved, he no longer kept\nup appearances, and insensibly his ways changed.\nHe had no longer, as formerly, words so gentle that they made her cry, nor passionate caresses that made\nher mad, so that their great love, which engrossed her life, seemed to lessen beneath her like the water of\na stream absorbed into its channel, and she could see the bed of it. She would not believe it; she redoubled\nin tenderness, and Rodolphe concealed his indifference less and less.\nShe did not know if she regretted having yielded to him, or whether she did not wish, on the contrary, to\nenjoy him the more. The humiliation of feeling herself weak was turning to rancour, tempered by their\nvoluptuous pleasures. It was not affection; it was like a continual seduction. He subjugated her; she\nalmost feared him.\nAppearances, nevertheless, were calmer than ever, Rodolphe having succeeded in carrying out the\nadultery after his own fancy; and at the end of six months, when the spring-time came, they were to one\nanother like a married couple, tranquilly keeping up a domestic flame.\nIt was the time of year when old Rouault sent his turkey in remembrance of the setting of his leg. The\npresent always arrived with a letter. Emma cut the string that tied it to the basket, and read the following\nlines:--\n\"My Dear Children--I hope this will find you well, and that this one will be as good as the others. For it\nseems to me a little more tender, if I may venture to say so, and heavier. But next time, for a change, I'll\ngive you a turkeycock, unless you have a preference for some dabs; and send me back the hamper, if you\nplease, with the two old ones. I have had an accident with my cart-sheds, whose covering flew off one\nwindy night among the trees. The harvest has not been overgood either. Finally, I don't know when I\nshall come to see you. It is so difficult now to leave the house since I am alone, my poor Emma.\"\nHere there was a break in the lines, as if the old fellow had dropped his pen to dream a little while.\n-94\n\n\"For myself, I am very well, except for a cold I caught the other day at the fair at Yvetot, where I had\ngone to hire a shepherd, having turned away mine because he was too dainty. How we are to be pitied\nwith such a lot of thieves! Besides, he was also rude. I heard from a pedlar, who, travelling through your\npart of the country this winter, had a tooth drawn, that Bovary was as usual working hard. That doesn't\nsurprise me; and he showed me his tooth; we had some coffee together. I asked him if he had seen you,\nand he said not, but that he had seen two horses in the stables, from which I conclude that business is\nlooking up. So much the better, my dear children, and may God send you every imaginable happiness! It\ngrieves me not yet to have seen my dear little grand-daughter, Berthe Bovary. I have planted an Orleans\nplum-tree for her in the garden under your room, and I won't have it touched unless it is to have jam\nmade for her by and bye, that I will keep in the cupboard for her when she comes.\n\"Good-bye, my dear children. I kiss you, my girl, you too, my son-in-law, and the little one on both\ncheeks. I am, with best compliments, your loving father.\n\"Theodore Rouault.\"\nShe held the coarse paper in her fingers for some minutes. The spelling mistakes were interwoven one\nwith the other, and Emma followed the kindly thought that cackled right through it like a hen half hidden\nin the hedge of thorns. The writing had been dried with ashes from the hearth, for a little grey powder\nslipped from the letter on to her dress, and she almost thought she saw her father bending over the hearth\nto take up the tongs. How long since she had been with him, sitting on the footstool in the\nchimney-corner, where she used to burn the end of a bit of wood in the great flame of the sea-sedges! She\nremembered the summer evenings all full of sunshine. The colts neighed when anyone passed by, and\ngalloped, galloped. Under her window there was a beehive, and sometimes the bees wheeling round in the\nlight struck against her window like rebounding balls of gold. What happiness there had been at that time,\nwhat freedom, what hope! What an abundance of illusions! Nothing was left of them now. She had got rid\nof them all in her soul's life, in all her successive conditions of lifemaidenhood, her marriage, and her\nlove--thus constantly losing them all her life through, like a traveller who leaves something of his wealth\nat every inn along his road.\nBut what then, made her so unhappy? What was the extraordinary catastrophe that had transformed her?\nAnd she raised her head, looking round as if to seek the cause of that which made her suffer.\nAn April ray was dancing on the china of the whatnot; the fire burned; beneath her slippers she felt the\nsoftness of the carpet; the day was bright, the air warm, and she heard her child shouting with laughter.\nIn fact, the little girl was just then rolling on the lawn in the midst of the grass that was being turned. She\nwas lying flat on her stomach at the top of a rick. The servant was holding her by her skirt. Lestiboudois\nwas raking by her side, and every time he came near she lent forward, beating the air with both her arms.\n\"Bring her to me,\" said her mother, rushing to embrace her. \"How I love you, my poor child! How I love\nyou!\"\nThen noticing that the tips of her ears were rather dirty, she rang at once for warm water, and washed her,\nchanged her linen, her stockings, her shoes, asked a thousand questions about her health, as if on the\nreturn from a long journey, and finally, kissing her again and crying a little, she gave her back to the\nservant, who stood quite thunderstricken at this excess of tenderness.\nThat evening Rodolphe found her more serious than usual.\n\"That will pass over,\" he concluded; \"it's a whim:\"\n-95\n\nAnd he missed three rendezvous running. When he did come, she showed herself cold and almost\ncontemptuous.\n\"Ah! you're losing your time, my lady!\"\nAnd he pretended not to notice her melancholy sighs, nor the handkerchief she took out.\nThen Emma repented. She even asked herself why she detested Charles; if it had not been better to have\nbeen able to love him? But he gave her no opportunities for such a revival of sentiment, so that she was\nmuch embarrassed by her desire for sacrifice, when the druggist came just in time to provide her with an\nopportunity.\nChapter Eleven\nHe had recently read a eulogy on a new method for curing club-foot, and as he was a partisan of progress,\nhe conceived the patriotic idea that Yonville, in order to keep to the fore, ought to have some operations\nfor strephopody or club-foot.\n\"For,\" said he to Emma, \"what risk is there? See--\" (and he enumerated on his fingers the advantages of\nthe attempt), \"success, almost certain relief and beautifying of the patient, celebrity acquired by the\noperator. Why, for example, should not your husband relieve poor Hippolyte of the 'Lion d'Or'? Note\nthat he would not fail to tell about his cure to all the travellers, and then\" (Homais lowered his voice and\nlooked round him) \"who is to prevent me from sending a short paragraph on the subject to the paper? Eh!\ngoodness me! an article gets about; it is talked of; it ends by making a snowball! And who knows? who\nknows?\"\nIn fact, Bovary might succeed. Nothing proved to Emma that he was not clever; and what a satisfaction\nfor her to have urged him to a step by which his reputation and fortune would be increased! She only\nwished to lean on something more solid than love.\nCharles, urged by the druggist and by her, allowed himself to be persuaded. He sent to Rouen for Dr.\nDuval's volume, and every evening, holding his head between both hands, plunged into the reading of it.\nWhile he was studying equinus, varus, and valgus, that is to say, katastrephopody, endostrephopody, and\nexostrephopody (or better, the various turnings of the foot downwards, inwards, and outwards, with the\nhypostrephopody and anastrephopody), otherwise torsion downwards and upwards, Monsier Homais,\nwith all sorts of arguments, was exhorting the lad at the inn to submit to the operation.\n\"You will scarcely feel, probably, a slight pain; it is a simple prick, like a little blood-letting, less than the\nextraction of certain corns.\"\nHippolyte, reflecting, rolled his stupid eyes.\n\"However,\" continued the chemist, \"it doesn't concern me. It's for your sake, for pure humanity! I should\nlike to see you, my friend, rid of your hideous caudication, together with that waddling of the lumbar\nregions which, whatever you say, must considerably interfere with you in the exercise of your calling.\"\nThen Homais represented to him how much jollier and brisker he would feel afterwards, and even gave\nhim to understand that he would be more likely to please the women; and the stable-boy began to smile\nheavily. Then he attacked him through his vanity:\n\"Aren't you a man? Hang it! what would you have done if you had had to go into the army, to go and\n-96\n\nfight beneath the standard? Ah! Hippolyte!\"\nAnd Homais retired, declaring that he could not understand this obstinacy, this blindness in refusing the\nbenefactions of science.\nThe poor fellow gave way, for it was like a conspiracy. Binet, who never interfered with other people's\nbusiness, Madame Lefrancois, Artemise, the neighbours, even the mayor, Monsieur Tuvache--everyone\npersuaded him, lectured him, shamed him; but what finally decided him was that it would cost him\nnothing. Bovary even undertook to provide the machine for the operation. This generosity was an idea of\nEmma's, and Charles consented to it, thinking in his heart of hearts that his wife was an angel.\nSo by the advice of the chemist, and after three fresh starts, he had a kind of box made by the carpenter,\nwith the aid of the locksmith, that weighed about eight pounds, and in which iron, wood, sheer-iron,\nleather, screws, and nuts had not been spared.\nBut to know which of Hippolyte's tendons to cut, it was necessary first of all to find out what kind of\nclub-foot he had.\nHe had a foot forming almost a straight line with the leg, which, however, did not prevent it from being\nturned in, so that it was an equinus together with something of a varus, or else a slight varus with a strong\ntendency to equinus. But with this equinus, wide in foot like a horse's hoof, with rugose skin, dry\ntendons, and large toes, on which the black nails looked as if made of iron, the clubfoot ran about like a\ndeer from morn till night. He was constantly to be seen on the Place, jumping round the carts, thrusting\nhis limping foot forwards. He seemed even stronger on that leg than the other. By dint of hard service it\nhad acquired, as it were, moral qualities of patience and energy; and when he was given some heavy\nwork, he stood on it in preference to its fellow.\nNow, as it was an equinus, it was necessary to cut the tendon of Achilles, and, if need were, the anterior\ntibial muscle could be seen to afterwards for getting rid of the varus; for the doctor did not dare to risk\nboth operations at once; he was even trembling already for fear of injuring some important region that he\ndid not know.\nNeither Ambrose Pare, applying for the first time since Celsus, after an interval of fifteen centuries, a\nligature to an artery, nor Dupuytren, about to open an abscess in the brain, nor Gensoul when he first took\naway the superior maxilla, had hearts that trembled, hands that shook, minds so strained as Monsieur\nBovary when he approached Hippolyte, his tenotome between his fingers. And as at hospitals, near by on\na table lay a heap of lint, with waxed thread, many bandages--a pyramid of bandages--every bandage to\nbe found at the druggist's. It was Monsieur Homais who since morning had been organising all these\npreparations, as much to dazzle the multitude as to keep up his illusions. Charles pierced the skin; a dry\ncrackling was heard. The tendon was cut, the operation over. Hippolyte could not get over his surprise,\nbut bent over Bovary's hands to cover them with kisses.\n\"Come, be calm,\" said the druggist; \"later on you will show your gratitude to your benefactor.\"\nAnd he went down to tell the result to five or six inquirers who were waiting in the yard, and who fancied\nthat Hippolyte would reappear walking properly. Then Charles, having buckled his patient into the\nmachine, went home, where Emma, all anxiety, awaited him at the door. She threw herself on his neck;\nthey sat down to table; he ate much, and at dessert he even wanted to take a cup of coffee, a luxury he\nonly permitted himself on Sundays when there was company.\nThe evening was charming, full of prattle, of dreams together. They talked about their future fortune, of\n-97\n\nthe improvements to be made in their house; he saw people's estimation of him growing, his comforts\nincreasing, his wife always loving him; and she was happy to refresh herself with a new sentiment,\nhealthier, better, to feel at last some tenderness for this poor fellow who adored her. The thought of\nRodolphe for one moment passed through her mind, but her eyes turned again to Charles; she even\nnoticed with surprise that he had not bad teeth.\nThey were in bed when Monsieur Homais, in spite of the servant, suddenly entered the room, holding in\nhis hand a sheet of paper just written. It was the paragraph he intended for the \"Fanal de Rouen.\" He\nbrought it for them to read.\n\"Read it yourself,\" said Bovary.\nHe read--\n\" 'Despite the prejudices that still invest a part of the face of Europe like a net, the light nevertheless\nbegins to penetrate our country places. Thus on Tuesday our little town of Yonville found itself the scene\nof a surgical operation which is at the same time an, act of loftiest philanthropy. Monsieur Bovary, one of\nour, most distinguished practitioners--'\"\n\"Oh, that is too much! too much!\" said Charles, choking with emotion.\n\"No, no! not at all! What next!\"\n\" '--Performed an operation on a club-footed man.' I have not used the scientific term, because you know\nin a newspaper everyone would not perhaps understand. The masses must--'\"\n\"No doubt,\" said Bovary; \"go on!\"\n\"I proceed,\" said the chemist. \"'Monsieur Bovary, one of our most distinguished practitioners, performed\nan operation on a club-footed man called Hippolyte Tautain, stableman for the last twenty-five years at\nthe hotel of the \"Lion d'Or,\" kept by Widow Lefrancois, at the Place d'Armes. The novelty of the\nattempt, and the interest incident to the subject, had attracted such a concourse of persons that there was a\nveritable obstruction on the threshold of the establishment. The operation, moreover, was performed as if\nby magic, and barely a few drops of blood appeared on the skin, as though to say that the rebellious\ntendon had at last given way beneath the efforts of art. The patient, strangely enough--we affirm it as an\neye-witness--complained of no pain. His condition up to the present time leaves nothing to be desired.\nEverything tends to show that his convelescence will be brief; and who knows even if at our next village\nfestivity we shall not see our good Hippolyte figuring in the bacchic dance in the midst of a chorus of\njoyous boon-companions, and thus proving to all eyes by his verve and his capers his complete cure?\nHonour, then, to the generous savants! Honour to those indefatigable spirits who consecrate their vigils to\nthe amelioration or to the alleviation of their kind! Honour, thrice honour! Is it not time to cry that the\nblind shall see, the deaf hear, the lame walk? But that which fanaticism formerly promised to its elect,\nscience now accomplishes for all men. We shall keep our readers informed as to the successive phases of\nthis remarkable cure.' \"\nThis did not prevent Mere Lefrancois, from coming five days after, scared, and crying out--\n\"Help! he is dying! I am going crazy!\"\nCharles rushed to the \"Lion d'Or,\" and the chemist, who caught sight of him passing along the Place\nhatless, abandoned his shop. He appeared himself breathless, red, anxious, and asking everyone who was\n-98\n\ngoing up the stairs--\n\"Why, what's the matter with our interesting strephopode?\"\nThe strephopode was writhing in hideous convulsions, so that the machine in which his leg was enclosed\nwas knocked against the wall enough to break it.\nWith many precautions, in order not to disturb the position of the limb, the box was removed, and an\nawful sight presented itself. The outlines of the foot disappeared in such a swelling that the entire skin\nseemed about to burst, and it was covered with ecchymosis, caused by the famous machine. Hippolyte\nhad already complained of suffering from it. No attention had been paid to him; they had to acknowledge\nthat he had not been altogether wrong, and he was freed for a few hours. But, hardly had the oedema gone\ndown to some extent, than the two savants thought fit to put back the limb in the apparatus, strapping it\ntighter to hasten matters. At last, three days after, Hippolyte being unable to endure it any longer, they\nonce more removed the machine, and were much surprised at the result they saw. The livid tumefaction\nspread over the leg, with blisters here and there, whence there oozed a black liquid. Matters were taking a\nserious turn. Hippolyte began to worry himself, and Mere Lefrancois, had him installed in the little room\nnear the kitchen, so that he might at least have some distraction.\nBut the tax-collector, who dined there every day, complained bitterly of such companionship. Then\nHippolyte was removed to the billiard-room. He lay there moaning under his heavy coverings, pale with\nlong beard, sunken eyes, and from time to time turning his perspiring head on the dirty pillow, where the\nflies alighted. Madame Bovary went to see him. She brought him linen for his poultices; she comforted,\nand encouraged him. Besides, he did not want for company, especially on market-days, when the peasants\nwere knocking about the billiard-balls round him, fenced with the cues, smoked, drank, sang, and\nbrawled.\n\"How are you?\" they said, clapping him on the shoulder. \"Ah! you're not up to much, it seems, but it's\nyour own fault. You should do this! do that!\" And then they told him stories of people who had all been\ncured by other remedies than his. Then by way of consolation they added--\n\"You give way too much! Get up! You coddle yourself like a king! All the same, old chap, you don't\nsmell nice!\"\nGangrene, in fact, was spreading more and more. Bovary himself turned sick at it. He came every hour,\nevery moment. Hippolyte looked at him with eyes full of terror, sobbing--\n\"When shall I get well? Oh, save me! How unfortunate I am! How unfortunate I am!\"\nAnd the doctor left, always recommending him to diet himself.\n\"Don't listen to him, my lad,\" said Mere Lefrancois, \"Haven't they tortured you enough already? You'll\ngrow still weaker. Here! swallow this.\"\nAnd she gave him some good beef-tea, a slice of mutton, a piece of bacon, and sometimes small glasses\nof brandy, that he had not the strength to put to his lips.\nAbbe Bournisien, hearing that he was growing worse, asked to see him. He began by pitying his\nsufferings, declaring at the same time that he ought to rejoice at them since it was the will of the Lord,\nand take advantage of the occasion to reconcile himself to Heaven.\n-99\n\n\"For,\" said the ecclesiastic in a paternal tone, \"you rather neglected your duties; you were rarely seen at\ndivine worship. How many years is it since you approached the holy table? I understand that your work,\nthat the whirl of the world may have kept you from care for your salvation. But now is the time to reflect.\nYet don't despair. I have known great sinners, who, about to appear before God (you are not yet at this\npoint I know), had implored His mercy, and who certainly died in the best frame of mind. Let us hope\nthat, like them, you will set us a good example. Thus, as a precaution, what is to prevent you from saying\nmorning and evening a 'Hail Mary, full of grace,' and 'Our Father which art in heaven'? Yes, do that, for\nmy sake, to oblige me. That won't cost you anything. Will you promise me?\"\nThe poor devil promised. The cure came back day after day. He chatted with the landlady; and even told\nanecdotes interspersed with jokes and puns that Hippolyte did not understand. Then, as soon as he could,\nhe fell back upon matters of religion, putting on an appropriate expression of face.\nHis zeal seemed successful, for the club-foot soon manifested a desire to go on a pilgrimage to\nBon-Secours if he were cured; to which Monsieur Bournisien replied that he saw no objection; two\nprecautions were better than one; it was no risk anyhow.\nThe druggist was indignant at what he called the manoeuvres of the priest; they were prejudicial, he said,\nto Hippolyte's convalescence, and he kept repeating to Madame Lefrancois, \"Leave him alone! leave him\nalone! You perturb his morals with your mysticism.\" But the good woman would no longer listen to him;\nhe was the cause of it all. From a spirit of contradiction she hung up near the bedside of the patient a basin\nfilled with holy-water and a branch of box.\nReligion, however, seemed no more able to succour him than surgery, and the invincible gangrene still\nspread from the extremities towards the stomach. It was all very well to vary the potions and change the\npoultices; the muscles each day rotted more and more; and at last Charles replied by an affirmative nod of\nthe head when Mere Lefrancois, asked him if she could not, as a forlorn hope, send for Monsieur Canivet\nof Neufchatel, who was a celebrity.\nA doctor of medicine, fifty years of age, enjoying a good position and self-possessed, Charles's colleague\ndid not refrain from laughing disdainfully when he had uncovered the leg, mortified to the knee. Then\nhaving flatly declared that it must be amputated, he went off to the chemist's to rail at the asses who could\nhave reduced a poor man to such a state. Shaking Monsieur Homais by the button of his coat, he shouted\nout in the shop--\n\"These are the inventions of Paris! These are the ideas of those gentry of the capital! It is like strabismus,\nchloroform, lithotrity, a heap of monstrosities that the Government ought to prohibit. But they want to do\nthe clever, and they cram you with remedies without, troubling about the consequences. We are not so\nclever, not we! We are not savants, coxcombs, fops! We are practitioners; we cure people, and we should\nnot dream of operating on anyone who is in perfect health. Straighten club-feet! As if one could straighten\nclub-feet! It is as if one wished, for example, to make a hunchback straight!\"\nHomais suffered as he listened to this discourse, and he concealed his discomfort beneath a courtier's\nsmile; for he needed to humour Monsier Canivet, whose prescriptions sometimes came as far as Yonville.\nSo he did not take up the defence of Bovary; he did not even make a single remark, and, renouncing his\nprinciples, he sacrificed his dignity to the more serious interests of his business.\nThis amputation of the thigh by Doctor Canivet was a great event in the village. On that day all the\ninhabitants got up earlier, and the Grande Rue, although full of people, had something lugubrious about it,\nas if an execution had been expected. At the grocer's they discussed Hippolyte's illness; the shops did no\nbusiness, and Madame Tuvache, the mayor's wife, did not stir from her window, such was her impatience\n-100\n\nto see the operator arrive.\nHe came in his gig, which he drove himself. But the springs of the right side having at length given way\nbeneath the weight of his corpulence, it happened that the carriage as it rolled along leaned over a little,\nand on the other cushion near him could be seen a large box covered in red sheep-leather, whose three\nbrass clasps shone grandly.\nAfter he had entered like a whirlwind the porch of the \"Lion d'Or,\" the doctor, shouting very loud,\nordered them to unharness his horse. Then he went into the stable to see that he was eating his oats all\nright; for on arriving at a patient's he first of all looked after his mare and his gig. People even said about\nthis--\n\"Ah! Monsieur Canivet's a character!\"\nAnd he was the more esteemed for this imperturbable coolness. The universe to the last man might have\ndied, and he would not have missed the smallest of his habits.\nHomais presented himself.\n\"I count on you,\" said the doctor. \"Are we ready? Come along!\"\nBut the druggist, turning red, confessed that he was too sensitive to assist at such an operation.\n\"When one is a simple spectator,\" he said, \"the imagination, you know, is impressed. And then I have\nsuch a nervous system!\"\n\"Pshaw!\" interrupted Canivet; \"on the contrary, you seem to me inclined to apoplexy. Besides, that\ndoesn't astonish me, for you chemist fellows are always poking about your kitchens, which must end by\nspoiling your constitutions. Now just look at me. I get up every day at four o'clock; I shave with cold\nwater (and am never cold). I don't wear flannels, and I never catch cold; my carcass is good enough! I\nlive now in one way, now in another, like a philosopher, taking pot-luck; that is why I am not squeamish\nlike you, and it is as indifferent to me to carve a Christian as the first fowl that turns up. Then, perhaps,\nyou will say, habit! habit!\"\nThen, without any consideration for Hippolyte, who was sweating with agony between his sheets, these\ngentlemen entered into a conversation, in which the druggist compared the coolness of a surgeon to that\nof a general; and this comparison was pleasing to Canivet, who launched out on the exigencies of his art.\nHe looked upon, it as a sacred office, although the ordinary practitioners dishonoured it. At last, coming\nback to the patient, he examined the bandages brought by Homais, the same that had appeared for the\nclub-foot, and asked for someone to hold the limb for him. Lestiboudois was sent for, and Monsieur\nCanivet having turned up his sleeves, passed into the billiard-room, while the druggist stayed with\nArtemise and the landlady, both whiter than their aprons, and with ears strained towards the door.\nBovary during this time did not dare to stir from his house.\nHe kept downstairs in the sitting-room by the side of the fireless chimney, his chin on his breast, his\nhands clasped, his eyes staring. \"What a mishap!\" he thought, \"what a mishap!\" Perhaps, after all, he had\nmade some slip. He thought it over, but could hit upon nothing. But the most famous surgeons also made\nmistakes; and that is what no one would ever believe! People, on the contrary, would laugh, jeer! It would\nspread as far as Forges, as Neufchatel, as Rouen, everywhere! Who could say if his colleagues would not\nwrite against him. Polemics would ensue; he would have to answer in the papers. Hippolyte might even\n-101\n\nprosecute him. He saw himself dishonoured, ruined, lost; and his imagination, assailed by a world of\nhypotheses, tossed amongst them like an empty cask borne by the sea and floating upon the waves.\nEmma, opposite, watched him; she did not share his humiliation; she felt another--that of having\nsupposed such a man was worth anything. As if twenty times already she had not sufficiently perceived\nhis mediocrity.\nCharles was walking up and down the room; his boots creaked on the floor.\n\"Sit down,\" she said; \"you fidget me.\"\nHe sat down again.\nHow was it that she--she, who was so intelligent--could have allowed herself to be deceived again? and\nthrough what deplorable madness had she thus ruined her life by continual sacrifices? She recalled all her\ninstincts of luxury, all the privations of her soul, the sordidness of marriage, of the household, her dream\nsinking into the mire like wounded swallows; all that she had longed for, all that she had denied herself,\nall that she might have had! And for what? for what?\nIn the midst of the silence that hung over the village a heart-rending cry rose on the air. Bovary turned\nwhite to fainting. She knit her brows with a nervous gesture, then went on. And it was for him, for this\ncreature, for this man, who understood nothing, who felt nothing! For he was there quite quiet, not even\nsuspecting that the ridicule of his name would henceforth sully hers as well as his. She had made efforts\nto love him, and she had repented with tears for having yielded to another!\n\"But it was perhaps a valgus!\" suddenly exclaimed Bovary, who was meditating.\nAt the unexpected shock of this phrase falling on her thought like a leaden bullet on a silver plate, Emma,\nshuddering, raised her head in order to find out what he meant to say; and they looked at the other in\nsilence, almost amazed to see each other, so far sundered were they by their inner thoughts. Charles gazed\nat her with the dull look of a drunken man, while he listened motionless to the last cries of the sufferer,\nthat followed each other in long-drawn modulations, broken by sharp spasms like the far-off howling of\nsome beast being slaughtered. Emma bit her wan lips, and rolling between her fingers a piece of coral that\nshe had broken, fixed on Charles the burning glance of her eyes like two arrows of fire about to dart forth.\nEverything in him irritated her now; his face, his dress, what he did not say, his whole person, his\nexistence, in fine. She repented of her past virtue as of a crime, and what still remained of it rumbled\naway beneath the furious blows of her pride. She revelled in all the evil ironies of triumphant adultery.\nThe memory of her lover came back to her with dazzling attractions; she threw her whole soul into it,\nborne away towards this image with a fresh enthusiasm; and Charles seemed to her as much removed\nfrom her life, as absent forever, as impossible and annihilated, as if he had been about to die and were\npassing under her eyes.\nThere was a sound of steps on the pavement. Charles looked up, and through the lowered blinds he saw at\nthe corner of the market in the broad sunshine Dr. Canivet, who was wiping his brow with his\nhandkerchief. Homais, behind him, was carrying a large red box in his hand, and both were going towards\nthe chemist's.\nThen with a feeling of sudden tenderness and discouragement Charles turned to his wife saying to her--\n\"Oh, kiss me, my own!\"\n-102\n\n\"Leave me!\" she said, red with anger.\n\"What is the matter?\" he asked, stupefied. \"Be calm; compose yourself. You know well enough that I\nlove you. Come!\"\n\"Enough!\" she cried with a terrible look.\nAnd escaping from the room, Emma closed the door so violently that the barometer fell from the wall and\nsmashed on the floor.\nCharles sank back into his arm-chair overwhelmed, trying to discover what could be wrong with her,\nfancying some nervous illness, weeping, and vaguely feeling something fatal and incomprehensible\nwhirling round him.\nWhen Rodolphe came to the garden that evening, he found his mistress waiting for him at the foot of the\nsteps on the lowest stair. They threw their arms round one another, and all their rancour melted like snow\nbeneath the warmth of that kiss.\nChapter Twelve\nThey began to love one another again. Often, even in the middle of the day, Emma suddenly wrote to\nhim, then from the window made a sign to Justin, who, taking his apron off, quickly ran to La Huchette.\nRodolphe would come; she had sent for him to tell him that she was bored, that her husband was odious,\nher life frightful.\n\"But what can I do?\" he cried one day impatiently.\n\"Ah! if you would--\"\nShe was sitting on the floor between his knees, her hair loose, her look lost.\n\"Why, what?\" said Rodolphe.\nShe sighed.\n\"We would go and live elsewhere--somewhere!\"\n\"You are really mad!\" he said laughing. \"How could that be possible?\"\nShe returned to the subject; he pretended not to understand, and turned the conversation.\nWhat he did not understand was all this worry about so simple an affair as love. She had a motive, a\nreason, and, as it were, a pendant to her affection.\nHer tenderness, in fact, grew each day with her repulsion to her husband. The more she gave up herself to\nthe one, the more she loathed the other. Never had Charles seemed to her so disagreeable, to have such\nstodgy fingers, such vulgar ways, to be so dull as when they found themselves together after her meeting\nwith Rodolphe. Then, while playing the spouse and virtue, she was burning at the thought of that head\nwhose black hair fell in a curl over the sunburnt brow, of that form at once so strong and elegant, of that\nman, in a word, who had such experience in his reasoning, such passion in his desires. It was for him that\nshe filed her nails with the care of a chaser, and that there was never enough cold-cream for her skin, nor\nof patchouli for her handkerchiefs. She loaded herself with bracelets, rings, and necklaces. When he was\n-103\n\ncoming she filled the two large blue glass vases with roses, and prepared her room and her person like a\ncourtesan expecting a prince. The servant had to be constantly washing linen, and all day Felicite did not\nstir from the kitchen, where little Justin, who often kept her company, watched her at work.\nWith his elbows on the long board on which she was ironing, he greedily watched all these women's\nclothes spread about him, the dimity petticoats, the fichus, the collars, and the drawers with running\nstrings, wide at the hips and growing narrower below.\n\"What is that for?\" asked the young fellow, passing his hand over the crinoline or the hooks and eyes.\n\"Why, haven't you ever seen anything?\" Felicite answered laughing. \"As if your mistress, Madame\nHomais, didn't wear the same.\"\n\"Oh, I daresay! Madame Homais!\" And he added with a meditative air, \"As if she were a lady like\nmadame!\"\nBut Felicite grew impatient of seeing him hanging round her. She was six years older than he, and\nTheodore, Monsieur Guillaumin's servant, was beginning to pay court to her.\n\"Let me alone,\" she said, moving her pot of starch. \"You'd better be off and pound almonds; you are\nalways dangling about women. Before you meddle with such things, bad boy, wait till you've got a beard\nto your chin.\"\n\"Oh, don't be cross! I'll go and clean her boots.\"\nAnd he at once took down from the shelf Emma's boots, all coated with mud, the mud of the rendezvous,\nthat crumbled into powder beneath his fingers, and that he watched as it gently rose in a ray of sunlight.\n\"How afraid you are of spoiling them!\" said the servant, who wasn't so particular when she cleaned them\nherself, because as soon as the stuff of the boots was no longer fresh madame handed them over to her.\nEmma had a number in her cupboard that she squandered one after the other, without Charles allowing\nhimself the slightest observation. So also he disbursed three hundred francs for a wooden leg that she\nthought proper to make a present of to Hippolyte. Its top was covered with cork, and it had spring joints, a\ncomplicated mechanism, covered over by black trousers ending in a patent-leather boot. But Hippolyte,\nnot daring to use such a handsome leg every day, begged Madame Bovary to get him another more\nconvenient one. The doctor, of course, had again to defray the expense of this purchase.\nSo little by little the stable-man took up his work again. One saw him running about the village as before,\nand when Charles heard from afar the sharp noise of the wooden leg, he at once went in another direction.\nIt was Monsieur Lheureux, the shopkeeper, who had undertaken the order; this provided him with an\nexcuse for visiting Emma. He chatted with her about the new goods from Paris, about a thousand\nfeminine trifles, made himself very obliging, and never asked for his money. Emma yielded to this lazy\nmode of satisfying all her caprices. Thus she wanted to have a very handsome ridding-whip that was at an\numbrella-maker's at Rouen to give to Rodolphe. The week after Monsieur Lheureux placed it on her\ntable.\nBut the next day he called on her with a bill for two hundred and seventy francs, not counting the\ncentimes. Emma was much embarrassed; all the drawers of the writing-table were empty; they owed over\na fortnight's wages to Lestiboudois, two quarters to the servant, for any quantity of other things, and\n-104\n\nBovary was impatiently expecting Monsieur Derozeray's account, which he was in the habit of paying\nevery year about Midsummer.\nShe succeeded at first in putting off Lheureux. At last he lost patience; he was being sued; his capital was\nout, and unless he got some in he should be forced to take back all the goods she had received.\n\"Oh, very well, take them!\" said Emma.\n\"I was only joking,\" he replied; \"the only thing I regret is the whip. My word! I'll ask monsieur to return\nit to me.\"\n\"No, no!\" she said.\n\"Ah! I've got you!\" thought Lheureux.\nAnd, certain of his discovery, he went out repeating to himself in an undertone, and with his usual low\nwhistle--\n\"Good! we shall see! we shall see!\"\nShe was thinking how to get out of this when the servant coming in put on the mantelpiece a small roll of\nblue paper \"from Monsieur Derozeray's.\" Emma pounced upon and opened it. It contained fifteen\nnapoleons; it was the account. She heard Charles on the stairs; threw the gold to the back of her drawer,\nand took out the key.\nThree days after Lheureux reappeared.\n\"I have an arrangement to suggest to you,\" he said. \"If, instead of the sum agreed on, you would take--\"\n\"Here it is,\" she said placing fourteen napoleons in his hand.\nThe tradesman was dumfounded. Then, to conceal his disappointment, he was profuse in apologies and\nproffers of service, all of which Emma declined; then she remained a few moments fingering in the\npocket of her apron the two five-franc pieces that he had given her in change. She promised herself she\nwould economise in order to pay back later on. \"Pshaw!\" she thought, \"he won't think about it again.\"\nBesides the riding-whip with its silver-gilt handle, Rodolphe had received a seal with the motto Amor nel\ncor[14] furthermore, a scarf for a muffler, and, finally, a cigar-case exactly like the Viscount's, that\nCharles had formerly picked up in the road, and that Emma had kept. These presents, however, humiliated\nhim; he refused several; she insisted, and he ended by obeying, thinking her tyrannical and overexacting.\n[14]A loving heart.\nThen she had strange ideas.\n\"When midnight strikes,\" she said, \"you must think of me.\"\nAnd if he confessed that he had not thought of her, there were floods of reproaches that always ended\nwith the eternal question--\n\"Do you love me?\"\n-105\n\n\"Why, of course I love you,\" he answered.\n\"A great deal?\"\n\"Certainly!\"\n\"You haven't loved any others?\"\n\"Did you think you'd got a virgin?\" he exclaimed laughing.\nEmma cried, and he tried to console her, adorning his protestations with puns.\n\"Oh,\" she went on, \"I love you! I love you so that I could not live without you, do you see? There are\ntimes when I long to see you again, when I am torn by all the anger of love. I ask myself, Where is he?\nPerhaps he is talking to other women. They smile upon him; he approaches. Oh no; no one else pleases\nyou. There are some more beautiful, but I love you best. I know how to love best. I am your servant, your\nconcubine! You are my king, my idol! You are good, you are beautiful, you are clever, you are strong!\"\nHe had so often heard these things said that they did not strike him as original. Emma was like all his\nmistresses; and the charm of novelty, gradually falling away like a garment, laid bare the eternal\nmonotony of passion, that has always the same forms and the same language. He did not distinguish, this\nman of so much experience, the difference of sentiment beneath the sameness of expression. Because lips\nlibertine and venal had murmured such words to him, he believed but little in the candour of hers;\nexaggerated speeches hiding mediocre affections must be discounted; as if the fullness of the soul did not\nsometimes overflow in the emptiest metaphors, since no one can ever give the exact measure of his needs,\nnor of his conceptions, nor of his sorrows; and since human speech is like a cracked tin kettle, on which\nwe hammer out tunes to make bears dance when we long to move the stars.\nBut with that superior critical judgment that belongs to him who, in no matter what circumstance, holds\nback, Rodolphe saw other delights to be got out of this love. He thought all modesty in the way. He\ntreated her quite sans facon.[15] He made of her something supple and corrupt. Hers was an idiotic sort of\nattachment, full of admiration for him, of voluptuousness for her, a beatitude that benumbed her; her soul\nsank into this drunkenness, shrivelled up, drowned in it, like Clarence in his butt of Malmsey.\n[15]Off-handedly.\nBy the mere effect of her love Madame Bovary's manners changed. Her looks grew bolder, her speech\nmore free; she even committed the impropriety of walking out with Monsieur Rodolphe, a cigarette in her\nmouth, \"as if to defy the people.\" At last, those who still doubted doubted no longer when one day they\nsaw her getting out of the \"Hirondelle,\" her waist squeezed into a waistcoat like a man; and Madame\nBovary senior, who, after a fearful scene with her husband, had taken refuge at her son's, was not the\nleast scandalised of the women-folk. Many other things displeased her. First, Charles had not attended to\nher advice about the forbidding of novels; then the \"ways of the house\" annoyed her; she allowed herself\nto make some remarks, and there were quarrels, especially one on account of Felicite.\nMadame Bovary senior, the evening before, passing along the passage, had surprised her in company of a\nman--a man with a brown collar, about forty years old, who, at the sound of her step, had quickly\nescaped through the kitchen. Then Emma began to laugh, but the good lady grew angry, declaring that\nunless morals were to be laughed at one ought to look after those of one's servants.\n\"Where were you brought up?\" asked the daughter-in-law, with so impertinent a look that Madame\n-106\n\nBovary asked her if she were not perhaps defending her own case.\n\"Leave the room!\" said the young woman, springing up with a bound.\n\"Emma! Mamma!\" cried Charles, trying to reconcile them.\nBut both had fled in their exasperation. Emma was stamping her feet as she repeated--\n\"Oh! what manners! What a peasant!\"\nHe ran to his mother; she was beside herself. She stammered\n\"She is an insolent, giddy-headed thing, or perhaps worse!\"\nAnd she was for leaving at once if the other did not apologise. So Charles went back again to his wife and\nimplored her to give way; he knelt to her; she ended by saying--\n\"Very well! I'll go to her.\"\nAnd in fact she held out her hand to her mother-in-law with the dignity of a marchioness as she said--\n\"Excuse me, madame.\"\nThen, having gone up again to her room, she threw herself flat on her bed and cried there like a child, her\nface buried in the pillow.\nShe and Rodolphe had agreed that in the event of anything extraordinary occurring, she should fasten a\nsmall piece of white paper to the blind, so that if by chance he happened to be in Yonville, he could hurry\nto the lane behind the house. Emma made the signal; she had been waiting three-quarters of an hour when\nshe suddenly caught sight of Rodolphe at the corner of the market. She felt tempted to open the window\nand call him, but he had already disappeared. She fell back in despair.\nSoon, however, it seemed to her that someone was walking on the pavement. It was he, no doubt. She\nwent downstairs, crossed the yard. He was there outside. She threw herself into his arms.\n\"Do take care!\" he said.\n\"Ah! if you knew!\" she replied.\nAnd she began telling him everything, hurriedly, disjointedly, exaggerating the facts, inventing many, and\nso prodigal of parentheses that he understood nothing of it.\n\"Come, my poor angel, courage! Be comforted! be patient!\"\n\"But I have been patient; I have suffered for four years. A love like ours ought to show itself in the face of\nheaven. They torture me! I can bear it no longer! Save me!\"\nShe clung to Rodolphe. Her eyes, full of tears, flashed like flames beneath a wave; her breast heaved; he\nhad never loved her so much, so that he lost his head and said \"What is, it? What do you wish?\"\n\"Take me away,\" she cried, \"carry me off! Oh, I pray you!\"\n-107\n\nAnd she threw herself upon his mouth, as if to seize there the unexpected consent if breathed forth in a\nkiss.\n\"But--\" Rodolphe resumed.\n\"What?\" \"Your little girl!\" She reflected a few moments, then replied--\n\"We will take her! It can't be helped!\"\n\"What a woman!\" he said to himself, watching her as she went. For she had run into the garden. Someone\nwas calling her.\nOn the following days Madame Bovary senior was much surprised at the change in her daughter-in-law.\nEmma, in fact, was showing herself more docile, and even carried her deference so far as to ask for a\nrecipe for pickling gherkins.\nWas it the better to deceive them both? Or did she wish by a sort of voluptuous stoicism to feel the more\nprofoundly the bitterness of the things she was about to leave?\nBut she paid no heed to them; on the contrary, she lived as lost in the anticipated delight of her coming\nhappiness.\nIt was an eternal subject for conversation with Rodolphe. She leant on his shoulder murmuring--\n\"Ah! when we are in the mail-coach! Do you think about it? Can it be? It seems to me that the moment I\nfeel the carriage start, it will be as if we were rising in a balloon, as if we were setting out for the clouds.\nDo you know that I count the hours? And you?\"\nNever had Madame Bovary been so beautiful as at this period; she had that indefinable beauty that results\nfrom joy, from enthusiasm, from success, and that is only the harmony of temperament with\ncircumstances. Her desires, her sorrows, the experience of pleasure, and her ever-young illusions, that\nhad, as soil and rain and winds and the sun make flowers grow, gradually developed her, and she at length\nblossomed forth in all the plenitude of her nature. Her eyelids seemed chiselled expressly for her long\namorous looks in which the pupil disappeared, while a strong inspiration expanded her delicate nostrils\nand raised the fleshy corner of her lips, shaded in the light by a little black down. One would have thought\nthat an artist apt in conception had arranged the curls of hair upon her neck; they fell in a thick mass,\nnegligently, and with the changing chances of their adultery, that unbound them every day. Her voice\nnow took more mellow infections, her figure also; something subtle and penetrating escaped even from\nthe folds of her gown and from the line of her foot. Charles, as when they were first married, thought her\ndelicious and quite irresistible.\nWhen he came home in the middle of the night, he did not dare to wake her. The porcelain night-light\nthrew a round trembling gleam upon the ceiling, and the drawn curtains of the little cot formed as it were\na white hut standing out in the shade, and by the bedside Charles looked at them. He seemed to hear the\nlight breathing of his child. She would grow big now; every season would bring rapid progress. He\nalready saw her coming from school as the day drew in, laughing, with ink-stains on her jacket, and\ncarrying her basket on her arm. Then she would have to be sent to the boarding-school; that would cost\nmuch; how was it to be done? Then he reflected. He thought of hiring a small farm in the neighbourhood,\nthat he would superintend every morning on his way to his patients. He would save up what he brought\nin; he would put it in the savings-bank. Then he would buy shares somewhere, no matter where; besides,\nhis practice would increase; he counted upon that, for he wanted Berthe to be well-educated, to be\n-108\n\naccomplished, to learn to play the piano. Ah! how pretty she would be later on when she was fifteen,\nwhen, resembling her mother, she would, like her, wear large straw hats in the summer-time; from a\ndistance they would be taken for two sisters. He pictured her to himself working in the evening by their\nside beneath the light of the lamp; she would embroider him slippers; she would look after the house; she\nwould fill all the home with her charm and her gaiety. At last, they would think of her marriage; they\nwould find her some good young fellow with a steady business; he would make her happy; this would last\nfor ever.\nEmma was not asleep; she pretended to be; and while he dozed off by her side she awakened to other\ndreams.\nTo the gallop of four horses she was carried away for a week towards a new land, whence they would\nreturn no more. They went on and on, their arms entwined, without a word. Often from the top of a\nmountain there suddenly glimpsed some splendid city with domes, and bridges, and ships, forests of\ncitron trees, and cathedrals of white marble, on whose pointed steeples were storks' nests. They went at a\nwalking-pace because of the great flag-stones, and on the ground there were bouquets of flowers, offered\nyou by women dressed in red bodices. They heard the chiming of bells, the neighing of mules, together\nwith the murmur of guitars and the noise of fountains, whose rising spray refreshed heaps of fruit\narranged like a pyramid at the foot of pale statues that smiled beneath playing waters. And then, one night\nthey came to a fishing village, where brown nets were drying in the wind along the cliffs and in front of\nthe huts. It was there that they would stay; they would live in a low, flat-roofed house, shaded by a\npalm-tree, in the heart of a gulf, by the sea. They would row in gondolas, swing in hammocks, and their\nexistence would be easy and large as their silk gowns, warm and star-spangled as the nights they would\ncontemplate. However, in the immensity of this future that she conjured up, nothing special stood forth;\nthe days, all magnificent, resembled each other like waves; and it swayed in the horizon, infinite,\nharmonised, azure, and bathed in sunshine. But the child began to cough in her cot or Bovary snored more\nloudly, and Emma did not fall asleep till morning, when the dawn whitened the windows, and when little\nJustin was already in the square taking down the shutters of the chemist's shop.\nShe had sent for Monsieur Lheureux, and had said to him--\n\"I want a cloak--a large lined cloak with a deep collar.\"\n\"You are going on a journey?\" he asked.\n\"No; but--never mind. I may count on you, may I not, and quickly?\"\nHe bowed.\n\"Besides, I shall want,\" she went on, \"a trunk--not too heavy-- handy.\"\n\"Yes, yes, I understand. About three feet by a foot and a half, as they are being made just now.\"\n\"And a travelling bag.\"\n\"Decidedly,\" thought Lheureux. \"there's a row on here.\"\n\"And,\" said Madame Bovary, taking her watch from her belt, \"take this; you can pay yourself out of it.\"\nBut the tradesman cried out that she was wrong; they knew one another; did he doubt her? What\nchildishness!\n-109\n\nShe insisted, however, on his taking at least the chain, and Lheureux had already put it in his pocket and\nwas going, when she called him back.\n\"You will leave everything at your place. As to the cloak\"--she seemed to be reflecting--\"do not bring it\neither; you can give me the maker's address, and tell him to have it ready for me.\"\nIt was the next month that they were to run away. She was to leave Yonville as if she was going on some\nbusiness to Rouen. Rodolphe would have booked the seats, procured the passports, and even have written\nto Paris in order to have the whole mail-coach reserved for them as far as Marseilles, where they would\nbuy a carriage, and go on thence without stopping to Genoa. She would take care to send her luggage to\nLheureux whence it would be taken direct to the \"Hirondelle,\" so that no one would have any suspicion.\nAnd in all this there never was any allusion to the child. Rodolphe avoided speaking of her; perhaps he no\nlonger thought about it.\nHe wished to have two more weeks before him to arrange some affairs; then at the end of a week he\nwanted two more; then he said he was ill; next he went on a journey. The month of August passed, and,\nafter all these delays, they decided that it was to be irrevocably fixed for the 4th September--a Monday.\nAt length the Saturday before arrived.\nRodolphe came in the evening earlier than usual.\n\"Everything is ready?\" she asked him.\n\"Yes.\"\nThen they walked round a garden-bed, and went to sit down near the terrace on the kerb-stone of the wall.\n\"You are sad,\" said Emma.\n\"No; why?\"\nAnd yet he looked at her strangely in a tender fashion.\n\"It is because you are going away?\" she went on; \"because you are leaving what is dear to you--your\nlife? Ah! I understand. I have nothing in the world! you are all to me; so shall I be to you. I will be your\npeople, your country; I will tend, I will love you!\"\n\"How sweet you are!\" he said, seizing her in his arms.\n\"Really!\" she said with a voluptuous laugh. \"Do you love me? Swear it then!\"\n\"Do I love you--love you? I adore you, my love.\"\nThe moon, full and purple-coloured, was rising right out of the earth at the end of the meadow. She rose\nquickly between the branches of the poplars, that hid her here and there like a black curtain pierced with\nholes. Then she appeared dazzling with whiteness in the empty heavens that she lit up, and now sailing\nmore slowly along, let fall upon the river a great stain that broke up into an infinity of stars; and the silver\nsheen seemed to writhe through the very depths like a heedless serpent covered with luminous scales; it\nalso resembled some monster candelabra all along which sparkled drops of diamonds running together.\nThe soft night was about them; masses of shadow filled the branches. Emma, her eyes half closed,\n-110\n\nbreathed in with deep sighs the fresh wind that was blowing. They did not speak, lost as they were in the\nrush of their reverie. The tenderness of the old days came back to their hearts, full and silent as the\nflowing river, with the softness of the perfume of the syringas, and threw across their memories shadows\nmore immense and more sombre than those of the still willows that lengthened out over the grass. Often\nsome night-animal, hedgehog or weasel, setting out on the hunt, disturbed the lovers, or sometimes they\nheard a ripe peach falling all alone from the espalier.\n\"Ah! what a lovely night!\" said Rodolphe.\n\"We shall have others,\" replied Emma; and, as if speaking to herself: \"Yet, it will be good to travel. And\nyet, why should my heart be so heavy? Is it dread of the unknown? The effect of habits left? Or rather--?\nNo; it is the excess of happiness. How weak I am, am I not? Forgive me!\"\n\"There is still time!\" he cried. \"Reflect! perhaps you may repent!\"\n\"Never!\" she cried impetuously. And coming closer to him: \"What ill could come to me? There is no\ndesert, no precipice, no ocean I would not traverse with you. The longer we live together the more it will\nbe like an embrace, every day closer, more heart to heart. There will be nothing to trouble us, no cares, no\nobstacle. We shall be alone, all to ourselves eternally. Oh, speak! Answer me!\"\nAt regular intervals he answered, \"Yes--Yes--\" She had passed her hands through his hair, and she\nrepeated in a childlike voice, despite the big tears which were falling, \"Rodolphe! Rodolphe! Ah!\nRodolphe! dear little Rodolphe!\"\nMidnight struck.\n\"Midnight!\" said she. \"Come, it is to-morrow. One day more!\"\nHe rose to go; and as if the movement he made had been the signal for their flight, Emma said, suddenly\nassuming a gay air--\n\"You have the passports?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"You are forgetting nothing?\"\n\"No.\"\n\"Are you sure?\"\n\"Certainly.\"\n\"It is at the Hotel de Provence, is it not, that you will wait for me at midday?\"\nHe nodded.\n\"Till to-morrow then!\" said Emma in a last caress; and she watched him go.\nHe did not turn round. She ran after him, and, leaning over the water's edge between the bulrushes\n-111\n\n\"To-morrow!\" she cried.\nHe was already on the other side of the river and walking fast across the meadow.\nAfter a few moments Rodolphe stopped; and when he saw her with her white gown gradually fade away\nin the shade like a ghost, he was seized with such a beating of the heart that he leant against a tree lest he\nshould fall.\n\"What an imbecile I am!\" he said with a fearful oath. \"No matter! She was a pretty mistress!\"\nAnd immediately Emma's beauty, with all the pleasures of their love, came back to him. For a moment he\nsoftened; then he rebelled against her.\n\"For, after all,\" he exclaimed, gesticulating, \"I can't exile myself--have a child on my hands.\"\nHe was saying these things to give himself firmness.\n\"And besides, the worry, the expense! Ah! no, no, no, no! a thousand times no! That would be too\nstupid.\"\nChapter Thirteen\nNo sooner was Rodolphe at home than he sat down quickly at his bureau under the stag's head that hung\nas a trophy on the wall. But when he had the pen between his fingers, he could think of nothing, so that,\nresting on his elbows, he began to reflect. Emma seemed to him to have receded into a far-off past, as if\nthe resolution he had taken had suddenly placed a distance between them.\nTo get back something of her, he fetched from the cupboard at the bedside an old Rheims biscuit-box, in\nwhich he usually kept his letters from women, and from it came an odour of dry dust and withered roses.\nFirst he saw a handkerchief with pale little spots. It was a handkerchief of hers. Once when they were\nwalking her nose had bled; he had forgotten it. Near it, chipped at all the corners, was a miniature given\nhim by Emma: her toilette seemed to him pretentious, and her languishing look in the worst possible taste.\nThen, from looking at this image and recalling the memory of its original, Emma's features little by little\ngrew confused in his remembrance, as if the living and the painted face, rubbing one against the other,\nhad effaced each other. Finally, he read some of her letters; they were full of explanations relating to their\njourney, short, technical, and urgent, like business notes. He wanted to see the long ones again, those of\nold times. In order to find them at the bottom of the box, Rodolphe disturbed all the others, and\nmechanically began rummaging amidst this mass of papers and things, finding pell-mell bouquets,\ngarters, a black mask, pins, and hair--hair! dark and fair, some even, catching in the hinges of the box,\nbroke when it was opened.\nThus dallying with his souvenirs, he examined the writing and the style of the letters, as varied as their\northography. They were tender or jovial, facetious, melancholy; there were some that asked for love,\nothers that asked for money. A word recalled faces to him, certain gestures, the sound of a voice;\nsometimes, however, he remembered nothing at all.\nIn fact, these women, rushing at once into his thoughts, cramped each other and lessened, as reduced to a\nuniform level of love that equalised them all. So taking handfuls of the mixed-up letters, he amused\nhimself for some moments with letting them fall in cascades from his right into his left hand. At last,\nbored and weary, Rodolphe took back the box to the cupboard, saying to himself, \"What a lot of\nrubbish!\" Which summed up his opinion; for pleasures, like schoolboys in a school courtyard, had so\ntrampled upon his heart that no green thing grew there, and that which passed through it, more heedless\n-112\n\nthan children, did not even, like them, leave a name carved upon the wall.\n\"Come,\" said he, \"let's begin.\"\nHe wrote--\n\"Courage, Emma! courage! I would not bring misery into your life.\"\n\"After all, that's true,\" thought Rodolphe. \"I am acting in her interest; I am honest.\"\n\"Have you carefully weighed your resolution? Do you know to what an abyss I was dragging you, poor\nangel? No, you do not, do you? You were coming confident and fearless, believing in happiness in the\nfuture. Ah! unhappy that we are--insensate!\"\nRodolphe stopped here to think of some good excuse.\n\"If I told her all my fortune is lost? No! Besides, that would stop nothing. It would all have to be begun\nover again later on. As if one could make women like that listen to reason!\" He reflected, then went on--\n\"I shall not forget you, oh believe it; and I shall ever have a profound devotion for you; but some day,\nsooner or later, this ardour (such is the fate of human things) would have grown less, no doubt. Lassitude\nwould have come to us, and who knows if I should not even have had the atrocious pain of witnessing\nyour remorse, of sharing it myself, since I should have been its cause? The mere idea of the grief that\nwould come to you tortures me, Emma. Forget me! Why did I ever know you? Why were you so\nbeautiful? Is it my fault? O my God! No, no! Accuse only fate.\"\n\"That's a word that always tells,\" he said to himself.\n\"Ah, if you had been one of those frivolous women that one sees, certainly I might, through egotism, have\ntried an experiment, in that case without danger for you. But that delicious exaltation, at once your charm\nand your torment, has prevented you from understanding, adorable woman that you are, the falseness of\nour future position. Nor had I reflected upon this at first, and I rested in the shade of that ideal happiness\nas beneath that of the manchineel tree, without foreseeing the consequences.\"\n\"Perhaps she'll think I'm giving it up from avarice. Ah, well! so much the worse; it must be stopped!\"\n\"The world is cruel, Emma. Wherever we might have gone, it would have persecuted us. You would have\nhad to put up with indiscreet questions, calumny, contempt, insult perhaps. Insult to you! Oh! And I, who\nwould place you on a throne! I who bear with me your memory as a talisman! For I am going to punish\nmyself by exile for all the ill I have done you. I am going away. Whither I know not. I am mad. Adieu! Be\ngood always. Preserve the memory of the unfortunate who has lost you. Teach my name to your child; let\nher repeat it in her prayers.\"\nThe wicks of the candles flickered. Rodolphe got up to, shut the window, and when he had sat down\nagain--\n\"I think it's all right. Ah! and this for fear she should come and hunt me up.\"\n\"I shall be far away when you read these sad lines, for I have wished to flee as quickly as possible to shun\nthe temptation of seeing you again. No weakness! I shall return, and perhaps later on we shall talk\ntogether very coldly of our old love. Adieu!\"\n-113\n\nAnd there was a last \"adieu\" divided into two words! \"A Dieu!\" which he thought in very excellent taste.\n\"Now how am I to sign?\" he said to himself. \" 'Yours devotedly?' No! 'Your friend?' Yes, that's it.\"\n\"Your friend.\"\nHe re-read his letter. He considered it very good.\n\"Poor little woman!\" he thought with emotion. \"She'll think me harder than a rock. There ought to have\nbeen some tears on this; but I can't cry; it isn't my fault.\" Then, having emptied some water into a glass,\nRodolphe dipped his finger into it, and let a big drop fall on the paper, that made a pale stain on the ink.\nThen looking for a seal, he came upon the one \"Amor nel cor.\"\n\"That doesn't at all fit in with the circumstances. Pshaw! never mind!\"\nAfter which he smoked three pipes and went to bed.\nThe next day when he was up (at about two o'clock--he had slept late), Rodolphe had a basket of\napricots picked. He put his letter at the bottom under some vine leaves, and at once ordered Girard, his\nploughman, to take it with care to Madame Bovary. He made use of this means for corresponding with\nher, sending according to the season fruits or game.\n\"If she asks after me,\" he said, \"you will tell her that I have gone on a journey. You must give the basket\nto her herself, into her own hands. Get along and take care!\"\nGirard put on his new blouse, knotted his handkerchief round the apricots, and walking with great heavy\nsteps in his thick iron-bound galoshes, made his way to Yonville.\nMadame Bovary, when he got to her house, was arranging a bundle of linen on the kitchen-table with\nFelicite.\n\"Here,\" said the ploughboy, \"is something for you--from the master.\"\nShe was seized with apprehension, and as she sought in her pocket for some coppers, she looked at the\npeasant with haggard eyes, while he himself looked at her with amazement, not understanding how such a\npresent could so move anyone. At last he went out. Felicite remained. She could bear it no longer; she ran\ninto the sitting room as if to take the apricots there, overturned the basket, tore away the leaves, found the\nletter, opened it, and, as if some fearful fire were behind her, Emma flew to her room terrified.\nCharles was there; she saw him; he spoke to her; she heard nothing, and she went on quickly up the stairs,\nbreathless, distraught, dumb, and ever holding this horrible piece of paper, that crackled between her\nfingers like a plate of sheet-iron. On the second floor she stopped before the attic door, which was closed.\nThen she tried to calm herself; she recalled the letter; she must finish it; she did not dare to. And where?\nHow? She would be seen! \"Ah, no! here,\" she thought, \"I shall be all right.\"\nEmma pushed open the door and went in.\nThe slates threw straight down a heavy heat that gripped her temples, stifled her; she dragged herself to\nthe closed garret-window. She drew back the bolt, and the dazzling light burst in with a leap.\n-114\n\nOpposite, beyond the roofs, stretched the open country till it was lost to sight. Down below, underneath\nher, the village square was empty; the stones of the pavement glittered, the weathercocks on the houses\nwere motionless. At the corner of the street, from a lower storey, rose a kind of humming with strident\nmodulations. It was Binet turning.\nShe leant against the embrasure of the window, and reread the letter with angry sneers. But the more she\nfixed her attention upon it, the more confused were her ideas. She saw him again, heard him, encircled\nhim with her arms, and throbs of her heart, that beat against her breast like blows of a sledge-hammer,\ngrew faster and faster, with uneven intervals. She looked about her with the wish that the earth might\ncrumble into pieces. Why not end it all? What restrained her? She was free. She advanced, looking at the\npaving-stones, saying to herself, \"Come! come!\"\nThe luminous ray that came straight up from below drew the weight of her body towards the abyss. It\nseemed to her that the ground of the oscillating square went up the walls and that the floor dipped on end\nlike a tossing boat. She was right at the edge, almost hanging, surrounded by vast space. The blue of the\nheavens suffused her, the air was whirling in her hollow head; she had but to yield, to let herself be taken;\nand the humming of the lathe never ceased, like an angry voice calling her.\n\"Emma! Emma!\" cried Charles.\nShe stopped.\n\"Wherever are you? Come!\"\nThe thought that she had just escaped from death almost made her faint with terror. She closed her eyes;\nthen she shivered at the touch of a hand on her sleeve; it was Felicite.\n\"Master is waiting for you, madame; the soup is on the table.\"\nAnd she had to go down to sit at table.\nShe tried to eat. The food choked her. Then she unfolded her napkin as if to examine the darns, and she\nreally thought of applying herself to this work, counting the threads in the linen. Suddenly the\nremembrance of the letter returned to her. How had she lost it? Where could she find it? But she felt such\nweariness of spirit that she could not even invent a pretext for leaving the table. Then she became a\ncoward; she was afraid of Charles; he knew all, that was certain! Indeed he pronounced these words in a\nstrange manner:\n\"We are not likely to see Monsieur Rodolphe soon again, it seems.\"\n\"Who told you?\" she said, shuddering.\n\"Who told me!\" he replied, rather astonished at her abrupt tone. \"Why, Girard, whom I met just now at\nthe door of the Cafe Francais. He has gone on a journey, or is to go.\"\nShe gave a sob.\n\"What surprises you in that? He absents himself like that from time to time for a change, and, ma foi, I\nthink he's right, when one has a fortune and is a bachelor. Besides, he has jolly times, has our friend. He's\na bit of a rake. Monsieur Langlois told me--\"\n-115\n\nHe stopped for propriety's sake because the servant came in. She put back into the basket the apricots\nscattered on the sideboard. Charles, without noticing his wife's colour, had them brought to him, took\none, and bit into it.\n\"Ah! perfect!\" said he; \"just taste!\"\nAnd he handed her the basket, which she put away from her gently.\n\"Do just smell! What an odour!\" he remarked, passing it under her nose several times.\n\"I am choking,\" she cried, leaping up. But by an effort of will the spasm passed; then--\n\"It is nothing,\" she said, \"it is nothing! It is nervousness. Sit down and go on eating.\" For she dreaded lest\nhe should begin questioning her, attending to her, that she should not be left alone.\nCharles, to obey her, sat down again, and he spat the stones of the apricots into his hands, afterwards\nputting them on his plate.\nSuddenly a blue tilbury passed across the square at a rapid trot. Emma uttered a cry and fell back rigid to\nthe ground.\nIn fact, Rodolphe, after many reflections, had decided to set out for Rouen. Now, as from La Huchette to\nBuchy there is no other way than by Yonville, he had to go through the village, and Emma had\nrecognised him by the rays of the lanterns, which like lightning flashed through the twilight.\nThe chemist, at the tumult which broke out in the house ran thither. The table with all the plates was\nupset; sauce, meat, knives, the salt, and cruet-stand were strewn over the room; Charles was calling for\nhelp; Berthe, scared, was crying; and Felicite, whose hands trembled, was unlacing her mistress, whose\nwhole body shivered convulsively.\n\"I'll run to my laboratory for some aromatic vinegar,\" said the druggist.\nThen as she opened her eyes on smelling the bottle--\n\"I was sure of it,\" he remarked; \"that would wake any dead person for you!\"\n\"Speak to us,\" said Charles; \"collect yourself; it is your Charles, who loves you. Do you know me? See!\nhere is your little girl! Oh, kiss her!\"\nThe child stretched out her arms to her mother to cling to her neck. But turning away her head, Emma\nsaid in a broken voice \"No, no! no one!\"\nShe fainted again. They carried her to her bed. She lay there stretched at full length, her lips apart, her\neyelids closed, her hands open, motionless, and white as a waxen image. Two streams of tears flowed\nfrom her eyes and fell slowly upon the pillow.\nCharles, standing up, was at the back of the alcove, and the chemist, near him, maintained that meditative\nsilence that is becoming on the serious occasions of life.\n\"Do not be uneasy,\" he said, touching his elbow; \"I think the paroxysm is past.\"\n-116\n\n\"Yes, she is resting a little now,\" answered Charles, watching her sleep. \"Poor girl! poor girl! She had\ngone off now!\"\nThen Homais asked how the accident had come about. Charles answered that she had been taken ill\nsuddenly while she was eating some apricots.\n\"Extraordinary!\" continued the chemist. \"But it might be that the apricots had brought on the syncope.\nSome natures are so sensitive to certain smells; and it would even be a very fine question to study both in\nits pathological and physiological relation. The priests know the importance of it, they who have\nintroduced aromatics into all their ceremonies. It is to stupefy the senses and to bring on ecstasies--a\nthing, moreover, very easy in persons of the weaker sex, who are more delicate than the other. Some are\ncited who faint at the smell of burnt hartshorn, of new bread--\"\n\"Take care; you'll wake her!\" said Bovary in a low voice.\n\"And not only,\" the druggist went on, \"are human beings subject to such anomalies, but animals also.\nThus you are not ignorant of the singularly aphrodisiac effect produced by the Nepeta cataria, vulgarly\ncalled catmint, on the feline race; and, on the other hand, to quote an example whose authenticity I can\nanswer for. Bridaux (one of my old comrades, at present established in the Rue Malpalu) possesses a dog\nthat falls into convulsions as soon as you hold out a snuff-box to him. He often even makes the\nexperiment before his friends at his summer-house at Guillaume Wood. Would anyone believe that a\nsimple sternutation could produce such ravages on a quadrupedal organism? It is extremely curious, is it\nnot?\"\n\"Yes,\" said Charles, who was not listening to him.\n\"This shows us,\" went on the other, smiling with benign self-sufficiency, \"the innumerable irregularities\nof the nervous system. With regard to madame, she has always seemed to me, I confess, very susceptible.\nAnd so I should by no means recommend to you, my dear friend, any of those so-called remedies that,\nunder the pretence of attacking the symptoms, attack the constitution. No; no useless physicking! Diet,\nthat is all; sedatives, emollients, dulcification. Then, don't you think that perhaps her imagination should\nbe worked upon?\"\n\"In what way? How?\" said Bovary.\n\"Ah! that is it. Such is indeed the question. 'That is the question,' as I lately read in a newspaper.\"\nBut Emma, awaking, cried out--\n\"The letter! the letter!\"\nThey thought she was delirious; and she was by midnight. Brain-fever had set in.\nFor forty-three days Charles did not leave her. He gave up all his patients; he no longer went to bed; he\nwas constantly feeling her pulse, putting on sinapisms and cold-water compresses. He sent Justin as far as\nNeufchatel for ice; the ice melted on the way; he sent him back again. He called Monsieur Canivet into\nconsultation; he sent for Dr. Lariviere, his old master, from Rouen; he was in despair. What alarmed him\nmost was Emma's prostration, for she did not speak, did not listen, did not even seem to suffer, as if her\nbody and soul were both resting together after all their troubles.\nAbout the middle of October she could sit up in bed supported by pillows. Charles wept when he saw her\n-117\n\neat her first bread-and-jelly. Her strength returned to her; she got up for a few hours of an afternoon, and\none day, when she felt better, he tried to take her, leaning on his arm, for a walk round the garden. The\nsand of the paths was disappearing beneath the dead leaves; she walked slowly, dragging along her\nslippers, and leaning against Charles's shoulder. She smiled all the time.\nThey went thus to the bottom of the garden near the terrace. She drew herself up slowly, shading her eyes\nwith her hand to look. She looked far off, as far as she could, but on the horizon were only great bonfires\nof grass smoking on the hills.\n\"You will tire yourself, my darling!\" said Bovary. And, pushing her gently to make her go into the\narbour, \"Sit down on this seat; you'll be comfortable.\"\n\"Oh! no; not there!\" she said in a faltering voice.\nShe was seized with giddiness, and from that evening her illness recommenced, with a more uncertain\ncharacter, it is true, and more complex symptoms. Now she suffered in her heart, then in the chest, the\nhead, the limbs; she had vomitings, in which Charles thought he saw the first signs of cancer.\nAnd besides this, the poor fellow was worried about money matters.\nChapter Fourteen\nTo begin with, he did not know how he could pay Monsieur Homais for all the physic supplied by him,\nand though, as a medical man, he was not obliged to pay for it, he nevertheless blushed a little at such an\nobligation. Then the expenses of the household, now that the servant was mistress, became terrible. Bills\nrained in upon the house; the tradesmen grumbled; Monsieur Lheureux especially harassed him. In fact, at\nthe height of Emma's illness, the latter, taking advantage of the circumstances to make his bill larger, had\nhurriedly brought the cloak, the travelling-bag, two trunks instead of one, and a number of other things. It\nwas very well for Charles to say he did not want them. The tradesman answered arrogantly that these\narticles had been ordered, and that he would not take them back; besides, it would vex madame in her\nconvalescence; the doctor had better think it over; in short, he was resolved to sue him rather than give up\nhis rights and take back his goods. Charles subsequently ordered them to be sent back to the shop. Felicite\nforgot; he had other things to attend to; then thought no more about them. Monsieur Lheureux returned to\nthe charge, and, by turns threatening and whining, so managed that Bovary ended by signing a bill at six\nmonths. But hardly had he signed this bill than a bold idea occurred to him: it was to borrow a thousand\nfrancs from Lheureux. So, with an embarrassed air, he asked if it were possible to get them, adding that it\nwould be for a year, at any interest he wished. Lheureux ran off to his shop, brought back the money, and\ndictated another bill, by which Bovary undertook to pay to his order on the 1st of September next the sum\nof one thousand and seventy francs, which, with the hundred and eighty already agreed to, made just\ntwelve hundred and fifty, thus lending at six per cent in addition to one-fourth for commission: and the\nthings bringing him in a good third at the least, this ought in twelve months to give him a profit of a\nhundred and thirty francs. He hoped that the business would not stop there; that the bills would not be\npaid; that they would be renewed; and that his poor little money, having thriven at the doctor's as at a\nhospital, would come back to him one day considerably more plump, and fat enough to burst his bag.\nEverything, moreover, succeeded with him. He was adjudicator for a supply of cider to the hospital at\nNeufchatel; Monsieur Guillaumin promised him some shares in the turf-pits of Gaumesnil, and he dreamt\nof establishing a new diligence service between Arcueil and Rouen, which no doubt would not be long in\nruining the ramshackle van of the \"Lion d'Or,\" and that, travelling faster, at a cheaper rate, and carrying\nmore luggage, would thus put into his hands the whole commerce of Yonville.\nCharles several times asked himself by what means he should next year be able to pay back so much\n-118\n\nmoney. He reflected, imagined expedients, such as applying to his father or selling something. But his\nfather would be deaf, and he--he had nothing to sell. Then he foresaw such worries that he quickly\ndismissed so disagreeable a subject of meditation from his mind. He reproached himself with forgetting\nEmma, as if, all his thoughts belonging to this woman, it was robbing her of something not to be\nconstantly thinking of her.\nThe winter was severe, Madame Bovary's convalescence slow. When it was fine they wheeled her\narm-chair to the window that overlooked the square, for she now had an antipathy to the garden, and the\nblinds on that side were always down. She wished the horse to be sold; what she formerly liked now\ndispleased her. All her ideas seemed to be limited to the care of herself. She stayed in bed taking little\nmeals, rang for the servant to inquire about her gruel or to chat with her. The snow on the market-roof\nthrew a white, still light into the room; then the rain began to fall; and Emma waited daily with a mind\nfull of eagerness for the inevitable return of some trifling events which nevertheless had no relation to\nher. The most important was the arrival of the \"Hirondelle\" in the evening. Then the landlady shouted\nout, and other voices answered, while Hippolyte's lantern, as he fetched the boxes from the boot, was like\na star in the darkness. At mid-day Charles came in; then he went out again; next she took some beef-tea,\nand towards five o'clock, as the day drew in, the children coming back from school, dragging their\nwooden shoes along the pavement, knocked the clapper of the shutters with their rulers one after the\nother.\nIt was at this hour that Monsieur Bournisien came to see her. He inquired after her health, gave her news,\nexhorted her to religion, in a coaxing little prattle that was not without its charm. The mere thought of his\ncassock comforted her.\nOne day, when at the height of her illness, she had thought herself dying, and had asked for the\ncommunion; and, while they were making the preparations in her room for the sacrament, while they were\nturning the night table covered with syrups into an altar, and while Felicite was strewing dahlia flowers\non the floor, Emma felt some power passing over her that freed her from her pains, from all perception,\nfrom all feeling. Her body, relieved, no longer thought; another life was beginning; it seemed to her that\nher being, mounting toward God, would be annihilated in that love like a burning incense that melts into\nvapour. The bed-clothes were sprinkled with holy water, the priest drew from the holy pyx the white\nwafer; and it was fainting with a celestial joy that she put out her lips to accept the body of the Saviour\npresented to her. The curtains of the alcove floated gently round her like clouds, and the rays of the two\ntapers burning on the night-table seemed to shine like dazzling halos. Then she let her head fall back,\nfancying she heard in space the music of seraphic harps, and perceived in an azure sky, on a golden\nthrone in the midst of saints holding green palms, God the Father, resplendent with majesty, who with a\nsign sent to earth angels with wings of fire to carry her away in their arms.\nThis splendid vision dwelt in her memory as the most beautiful thing that it was possible to dream, so that\nnow she strove to recall her sensation. That still lasted, however, but in a less exclusive fashion and with a\ndeeper sweetness. Her soul, tortured by pride, at length found rest in Christian humility, and, tasting the\njoy of weakness, she saw within herself the destruction of her will, that must have left a wide entrance for\nthe inroads of heavenly grace. There existed, then, in the place of happiness, still greater joys--another\nlove beyond all loves, without pause and without end, one that would grow eternally! She saw amid the\nillusions of her hope a state of purity floating above the earth mingling with heaven, to which she aspired.\nShe wanted to become a saint. She bought chaplets and wore amulets; she wished to have in her room, by\nthe side of her bed, a reliquary set in emeralds that she might kiss it every evening.\nThe cure marvelled at this humour, although Emma's religion, he thought, might, from its fervour, end by\ntouching on heresy, extravagance. But not being much versed in these matters, as soon as they went\nbeyond a certain limit he wrote to Monsieur Boulard, bookseller to Monsignor, to send him \"something\n-119\n\ngood for a lady who was very clever.\" The bookseller, with as much indifference as if he had been\nsending off hardware to niggers, packed up, pellmell, everything that was then the fashion in the pious\nbook trade. There were little manuals in questions and answers, pamphlets of aggressive tone after the\nmanner of Monsieur de Maistre, and certain novels in rose-coloured bindings and with a honied style,\nmanufactured by troubadour seminarists or penitent blue-stockings. There were the \"Think of it; the Man\nof the World at Mary's Feet, by Monsieur de --, decorated with many Orders\"; \"The Errors of Voltaire,\nfor the Use of the Young,\" etc.\nMadame Bovary's mind was not yet sufficiently clear to apply herself seriously to anything; moreover,\nshe began this reading in too much hurry. She grew provoked at the doctrines of religion; the arrogance of\nthe polemic writings displeased her by their inveteracy in attacking people she did not know; and the\nsecular stories, relieved with religion, seemed to her written in such ignorance of the world, that they\ninsensibly estranged her from the truths for whose proof she was looking. Nevertheless, she persevered;\nand when the volume slipped from her hands, she fancied herself seized with the finest Catholic\nmelancholy that an ethereal soul could conceive.\nAs for the memory of Rodolphe, she had thrust it back to the bottom of her heart, and it remained there\nmore solemn and more motionless than a king's mummy in a catacomb. An exhalation escaped from this\nembalmed love, that, penetrating through everything, perfumed with tenderness the immaculate\natmosphere in which she longed to live. When she knelt on her Gothic prie-Dieu, she addressed to the\nLord the same suave words that she had murmured formerly to her lover in the outpourings of adultery. It\nwas to make faith come; but no delights descended from the heavens, and she arose with tired limbs and\nwith a vague feeling of a gigantic dupery.\nThis searching after faith, she thought, was only one merit the more, and in the pride of her devoutness\nEmma compared herself to those grand ladies of long ago whose glory she, had dreamed of over a portrait\nof La Valliere, and who, trailing with so much majesty the lace-trimmed trains of their long gowns,\nretired into solitudes to shed at the feet of Christ all the tears of hearts that life had wounded.\nThen she gave herself up to excessive charity. She sewed clothes for the poor, she sent wood to women in\nchildbed; and Charles one day, on coming home, found three good-for-nothings in the kitchen seated at\nthe table eating soup. She had her little girl, whom during her illness her husband had sent back to the\nnurse, brought home. She wanted to teach her to read; even when Berthe cried, she was not vexed. She\nhad made up her mind to resignation, to universal indulgence. Her language about everything was full of\nideal expressions. She said to her child, \"Is your stomach-ache better, my angel?\"\nMadame Bovary senior found nothing to censure except perhaps this mania of knitting jackets for orphans\ninstead of mending her own house-linen; but, harassed with domestic quarrels, the good woman took\npleasure in this quiet house, and she even stayed there till after Easter, to escape the sarcasms of old\nBovary, who never failed on Good Friday to order chitterlings.\nBesides the companionship of her mother-in-law, who strengthened her a little by the rectitude of her\njudgment and her grave ways, Emma almost every day had other visitors. These were Madame Langlois,\nMadame Caron, Madame Dubreuil, Madame Tuvache, and regularly from two to five o'clock the\nexcellent Madame Homais, who, for her part, had never believed any of the tittle-tattle about her\nneighbour. The little Homais also came to see her; Justin accompanied them. He went up with them to her\nbedroom, and remained standing near the door, motionless and mute. Often even Madame Bovary; taking\nno heed of him, began her toilette. She began by taking out her comb, shaking her head with a quick\nmovement, and when he for the first time saw all this mass of hair that fell to her knees unrolling in black\nringlets, it was to him, poor child! like a sudden entrance into something new and strange, whose\nsplendour terrified him.\n-120\n\nEmma, no doubt, did not notice his silent attentions or his timidity. She had no suspicion that the love\nvanished from her life was there, palpitating by her side, beneath that coarse holland shirt, in that youthful\nheart open to the emanations of her beauty. Besides, she now enveloped all things with such indifference,\nshe had words so affectionate with looks so haughty, such contradictory ways, that one could no longer\ndistinguish egotism from charity, or corruption from virtue. One evening, for example, she was angry\nwith the servant, who had asked to go out, and stammered as she tried to find some pretext. Then\nsuddenly--\n\"So you love him?\" she said.\nAnd without waiting for any answer from Felicite, who was blushing, she added, \"There! run along; enjoy\nyourself!\"\nIn the beginning of spring she had the garden turned up from end to end, despite Bovary's remonstrances.\nHowever, he was glad to see her at last manifest a wish of any kind. As she grew stronger she displayed\nmore wilfulness. First, she found occasion to expel Mere Rollet, the nurse, who during her convalescence\nhad contracted the habit of coming too often to the kitchen with her two nurslings and her boarder, better\noff for teeth than a cannibal. Then she got rid of the Homais family, successively dismissed all the other\nvisitors, and even frequented church less assiduously, to the great approval of the druggist, who said to\nher in a friendly way--\n\"You were going in a bit for the cassock!\"\nAs formerly, Monsieur Bournisien dropped in every day when he came out after catechism class. He\npreferred staying out of doors to taking the air \"in the grove,\" as he called the arbour. This was the time\nwhen Charles came home. They were hot; some sweet cider was brought out, and they drank together to\nmadame's complete restoration.\nBinet was there; that is to say, a little lower down against the terrace wall, fishing for crayfish. Bovary\ninvited him to have a drink, and he thoroughly understood the uncorking of the stone bottles.\n\"You must,\" he said, throwing a satisfied glance all round him, even to the very extremity of the\nlandscape, \"hold the bottle perpendicularly on the table, and after the strings are cut, press up the cork\nwith little thrusts, gently, gently, as indeed they do seltzer-water at restaurants.\"\nBut during his demonstration the cider often spurted right into their faces, and then the ecclesiastic, with a\nthick laugh, never missed this joke--\n\"Its goodness strikes the eye!\"\nHe was, in fact, a good fellow and one day he was not even scandalised at the chemist, who advised\nCharles to give madame some distraction by taking her to the theatre at Rouen to hear the illustrious\ntenor, Lagardy. Homais, surprised at this silence, wanted to know his opinion, and the priest declared that\nhe considered music less dangerous for morals than literature.\nBut the chemist took up the defence of letters. The theatre, he contended, served for railing at prejudices,\nand, beneath a mask of pleasure, taught virtue.\n\"'Castigat ridendo mores,'[16] Monsieur Bournisien! Thus consider the greater part of Voltaire's\ntragedies; they are cleverly strewn with philosophical reflections, that made them a vast school of morals\nand diplomacy for the people.\"\n-121\n\n[16]It corrects customs through laughter.\n\"I,\" said Binet, \"once saw a piece called the 'Gamin de Paris,' in which there was the character of an old\ngeneral that is really hit off to a T. He sets down a young swell who had seduced a working girl, who at\nthe ending--\"\n\"Certainly,\" continued Homais, \"there is bad literature as there is bad pharmacy, but to condemn in a\nlump the most important of the fine arts seems to me a stupidity, a Gothic idea, worthy of the abominable\ntimes that imprisoned Galileo.\"\n\"I know very well,\" objected the cure, \"that there are good works, good authors. However, if it were only\nthose persons of different sexes united in a bewitching apartment, decorated rouge, those lights, those\neffeminate voices, all this must, in the long-run, engender a certain mental libertinage, give rise to\nimmodest thoughts and impure temptations. Such, at any rate, is the opinion of all the Fathers. Finally,\"\nhe added, suddenly assuming a mystic tone of voice while he rolled a pinch of snuff between his fingers,\n\"if the Church has condemned the theatre, she must be right; we must submit to her decrees.\"\n\"Why,\" asked the druggist, \"should she excommunicate actors? For formerly they openly took part in\nreligious ceremonies. Yes, in the middle of the chancel they acted; they performed a kind of farce called\n'Mysteries,' which often offended against the laws of decency.\"\nThe ecclesiastic contented himself with uttering a groan, and the chemist went on--\n\"It's like it is in the Bible; there there are, you know, more than one piquant detail, matters really\nlibidinous!\"\nAnd on a gesture of irritation from Monsieur Bournisien--\n\"Ah! you'll admit that it is not a book to place in the hands of a young girl, and I should be sorry if\nAthalie--\"\n\"But it is the Protestants, and not we,\" cried the other impatiently, \"who recommend the Bible.\"\n\"No matter,\" said Homais. \"I am surprised that in our days, in this century of enlightenment, anyone\nshould still persist in proscribing an intellectual relaxation that is inoffensive, moralising, and sometimes\neven hygienic; is it not, doctor?\"\n\"No doubt,\" replied the doctor carelessly, either because, sharing the same ideas, he wished to offend no\none, or else because he had not any ideas.\nThe conversation seemed at an end when the chemist thought fit to shoot a Parthian arrow.\n\"I've known priests who put on ordinary clothes to go and see dancers kicking about.\"\n\"Come, come!\" said the cure.\n\"Ah! I've known some!\" And separating the words of his sentence, Homais repeated,\n\"I--have--known--some!\"\n\"Well, they were wrong,\" said Bournisien, resigned to anything.\n-122\n\n\"By Jove! they go in for more than that,\" exclaimed the druggist.\n\"Sir!\" replied the ecclesiastic, with such angry eyes that the druggist was intimidated by them.\n\"I only mean to say,\" he replied in less brutal a tone, \"that toleration is the surest way to draw people to\nreligion.\"\n\"That is true! that is true!\" agreed the good fellow, sitting down again on his chair. But he stayed only a\nfew moments.\nThen, as soon as he had gone, Monsieur Homais said to the doctor--\n\"That's what I call a cock-fight. I beat him, did you see, in a way!--Now take my advice. Take madame\nto the theatre, if it were only for once in your life, to enrage one of these ravens, hang it! If anyone could\ntake my place, I would accompany you myself. Be quick about it. Lagardy is only going to give one\nperformance; he's engaged to go to England at a high salary. From what I hear, he's a regular dog; he's\nrolling in money; he's taking three mistresses and a cook along with him. All these great artists burn the\ncandle at both ends; they require a dissolute life, that suits the imagination to some extent. But they die at\nthe hospital, because they haven't the sense when young to lay by. Well, a pleasant dinner! Goodbye till\nto-morrow.\"\nThe idea of the theatre quickly germinated in Bovary's head, for he at once communicated it to his wife,\nwho at first refused, alleging the fatigue, the worry, the expense; but, for a wonder, Charles did not give\nin, so sure was he that this recreation would be good for her. He saw nothing to prevent it: his mother had\nsent them three hundred francs which he had no longer expected; the current debts were not very large,\nand the falling in of Lheureux's bills was still so far off that there was no need to think about them.\nBesides, imagining that she was refusing from delicacy, he insisted the more; so that by dint of worrying\nher she at last made up her mind, and the next day at eight o'clock they set out in the \"Hirondelle.\"\nThe druggist, whom nothing whatever kept at Yonville, but who thought himself bound not to budge from\nit, sighed as he saw them go.\n\"Well, a pleasant journey!\" he said to them; \"happy mortals that you are!\"\nThen addressing himself to Emma, who was wearing a blue silk gown with four flounces--\n\"You are as lovely as a Venus. You'll cut a figure at Rouen.\"\nThe diligence stopped at the \"Croix-Rouge\" in the Place Beauvoisine. It was the inn that is in every\nprovincial faubourg, with large stables and small bedrooms, where one sees in the middle of the court\nchickens pilfering the oats under the muddy gigs of the commercial travellers--a good old house, with\nworm-eaten balconies that creak in the wind on winter nights, always full of people, noise, and feeding,\nwhose black tables are sticky with coffee and brandy, the thick windows made yellow by the flies, the\ndamp napkins stained with cheap wine, and that always smells of the village, like ploughboys dressed in\nSundayclothes, has a cafe on the street, and towards the countryside a kitchen-garden. Charles at once set\nout. He muddled up the stage-boxes with the gallery, the pit with the boxes; asked for explanations, did\nnot understand them; was sent from the box-office to the acting-manager; came back to the inn, returned\nto the theatre, and thus several times traversed the whole length of the town from the theatre to the\nboulevard.\nMadame Bovary bought a bonnet, gloves, and a bouquet. The doctor was much afraid of missing the\n-123\n\nbeginning, and, without having had time to swallow a plate of soup, they presented themselves at the\ndoors of the theatre, which were still closed.\nChapter Fifteen\nThe crowd was waiting against the wall, symmetrically enclosed between the balustrades. At the corner of\nthe neighbouring streets huge bills repeated in quaint letters \"Lucie de Lammermoor-Lagardy-Opera-etc.\"\nThe weather was fine, the people were hot, perspiration trickled amid the curls, and handkerchiefs taken\nfrom pockets were mopping red foreheads; and now and then a warm wind that blew from the river gently\nstirred the border of the tick awnings hanging from the doors of the public-houses. A little lower down,\nhowever, one was refreshed by a current of icy air that smelt of tallow, leather, and oil. This was an\nexhalation from the Rue des Charrettes, full of large black warehouses where they made casks.\nFor fear of seeming ridiculous, Emma before going in wished to have a little stroll in the harbour, and\nBovary prudently kept his tickets in his hand, in the pocket of his trousers, which he pressed against his\nstomach.\nHer heart began to beat as soon as she reached the vestibule. She involuntarily smiled with vanity on\nseeing the crowd rushing to the right by the other corridor while she went up the staircase to the reserved\nseats. She was as pleased as a child to push with her finger the large tapestried door. She breathed in with\nall her might the dusty smell of the lobbies, and when she was seated in her box she bent forward with the\nair of a duchess.\nThe theatre was beginning to fill; opera-glasses were taken from their cases, and the subscribers, catching\nsight of one another, were bowing. They came to seek relaxation in the fine arts after the anxieties of\nbusiness; but \"business\" was not forgotten; they still talked cottons, spirits of wine, or indigo. The heads\nof old men were to be seen, inexpressive and peaceful, with their hair and complexions looking like silver\nmedals tarnished by steam of lead. The young beaux were strutting about in the pit, showing in the\nopening of their waistcoats their pink or applegreen cravats, and Madame Bovary from above admired\nthem leaning on their canes with golden knobs in the open palm of their yellow gloves.\nNow the lights of the orchestra were lit, the lustre, let down from the ceiling, throwing by the glimmering\nof its facets a sudden gaiety over the theatre; then the musicians came in one after the other; and first there\nwas the protracted hubbub of the basses grumbling, violins squeaking, cornets trumpeting, flutes and\nflageolets fifing. But three knocks were heard on the stage, a rolling of drums began, the brass\ninstruments played some chords, and the curtain rising, discovered a country-scene.\nIt was the cross-roads of a wood, with a fountain shaded by an oak to the left. Peasants and lords with\nplaids on their shoulders were singing a hunting-song together; then a captain suddenly came on, who\nevoked the spirit of evil by lifting both his arms to heaven. Another appeared; they went away, and the\nhunters started afresh. She felt herself transported to the reading of her youth, into the midst of Walter\nScott. She seemed to hear through the mist the sound of the Scotch bagpipes re-echoing over the heather.\nThen her remembrance of the novel helping her to understand the libretto, she followed the story phrase\nby phrase, while vague thoughts that came back to her dispersed at once again with the bursts of music.\nShe gave herself up to the lullaby of the melodies, and felt all her being vibrate as if the violin bows were\ndrawn over her nerves. She had not eyes enough to look at the costumes, the scenery, the actors, the\npainted trees that shook when anyone walked, and the velvet caps, cloaks, swords--all those imaginary\nthings that floated amid the harmony as in the atmosphere of another world. But a young woman stepped\nforward, throwing a purse to a squire in green. She was left alone, and the flute was heard like the\nmurmur of a fountain or the warbling of birds. Lucie attacked her cavatina in G major bravely. She\nplained of love; she longed for wings. Emma, too, fleeing from life, would have liked to fly away in an\nembrace. Suddenly Edgar-Lagardy appeared.\n-124\n\nHe had that splendid pallor that gives something of the majesty of marble to the ardent races of the South.\nHis vigorous form was tightly clad in a brown-coloured doublet; a small chiselled poniard hung against\nhis left thigh, and he cast round laughing looks showing his white teeth. They said that a Polish princess\nhaving heard him sing one night on the beach at Biarritz, where he mended boats, had fallen in love with\nhim. She had ruined herself for him. He had deserted her for other women, and this sentimental celebrity\ndid not fail to enhance his artistic reputation. The diplomatic mummer took care always to slip into his\nadvertisements some poetic phrase on the fascination of his person and the susceptibility of his soul. A\nfine organ, imperturbable coolness, more temperament than intelligence, more power of emphasis than of\nreal singing, made up the charm of this admirable charlatan nature, in which there was something of the\nhairdresser and the toreador.\nFrom the first scene he evoked enthusiasm. He pressed Lucy in his arms, he left her, he came back, he\nseemed desperate; he had outbursts of rage, then elegiac gurglings of infinite sweetness, and the notes\nescaped from his bare neck full of sobs and kisses. Emma leant forward to see him, clutching the velvet of\nthe box with her nails. She was filling her heart with these melodious lamentations that were drawn out to\nthe accompaniment of the double-basses, like the cries of the drowning in the tumult of a tempest. She\nrecognised all the intoxication and the anguish that had almost killed her. The voice of a prima donna\nseemed to her to be but echoes of her conscience, and this illusion that charmed her as some very thing of\nher own life. But no one on earth had loved her with such love. He had not wept like Edgar that last\nmoonlit night when they said, \"To-morrow! to-morrow!\" The theatre rang with cheers; they\nrecommenced the entire movement; the lovers spoke of the flowers on their tomb, of vows, exile, fate,\nhopes; and when they uttered the final adieu, Emma gave a sharp cry that mingled with the vibrations of\nthe last chords.\n\"But why,\" asked Bovary, \"does that gentleman persecute her?\"\n\"No, no!\" she answered; \"he is her lover!\"\n\"Yet he vows vengeance on her family, while the other one who came on before said, 'I love Lucie and\nshe loves me!' Besides, he went off with her father arm in arm. For he certainly is her father, isn't\nhe--the ugly little man with a cock's feather in his hat?\"\nDespite Emma's explanations, as soon as the recitative duet began in which Gilbert lays bare his\nabominable machinations to his master Ashton, Charles, seeing the false troth-ring that is to deceive\nLucie, thought it was a love-gift sent by Edgar. He confessed, moreover, that he did not understand the\nstory because of the music, which interfered very much with the words.\n\"What does it matter?\" said Emma. \"Do be quiet!\"\n\"Yes, but you know,\" he went on, leaning against her shoulder, \"I like to understand things.\"\n\"Be quiet! be quiet!\" she cried impatiently.\nLucie advanced, half supported by her women, a wreath of orange blossoms in her hair, and paler than the\nwhite satin of her gown. Emma dreamed of her marriage day; she saw herself at home again amid the\ncorn in the little path as they walked to the church. Oh, why had not she, like this woman, resisted,\nimplored? She, on the contrary, had been joyous, without seeing the abyss into which she was throwing\nherself. Ah! if in the freshness of her beauty, before the soiling of marriage and the disillusions of\nadultery, she could have anchored her life upon some great, strong heart, then virtue, tenderness,\nvoluptuousness, and duty blending, she would never have fallen from so high a happiness. But that\nhappiness, no doubt, was a lie invented for the despair of all desire. She now knew the smallness of the\n-125\n\npassions that art exaggerated. So, striving to divert her thoughts, Emma determined now to see in this\nreproduction of her sorrows only a plastic fantasy, well enough to please the eye, and she even smiled\ninternally with disdainful pity when at the back of the stage under the velvet hangings a man appeared in\na black cloak.\nHis large Spanish hat fell at a gesture he made, and immediately the instruments and the singers began the\nsextet. Edgar, flashing with fury, dominated all the others with his clearer voice; Ashton hurled homicidal\nprovocations at him in deep notes; Lucie uttered her shrill plaint, Arthur at one side, his modulated tones\nin the middle register, and the bass of the minister pealed forth like an organ, while the voices of the\nwomen repeating his words took them up in chorus delightfully. They were all in a row gesticulating, and\nanger, vengeance, jealousy, terror, and stupefaction breathed forth at once from their half-opened mouths.\nThe outraged lover brandished his naked sword; his guipure ruffle rose with jerks to the movements of his\nchest, and he walked from right to left with long strides, clanking against the boards the silver-gilt spurs\nof his soft boots, widening out at the ankles. He, she thought must have an inexhaustible love to lavish it\nupon the crowd with such effusion. All her small fault-findings faded before the poetry of the part that\nabsorbed her; and, drawn towards this man by the illusion of the character, she tried to imagine to herself\nhis life--that life resonant, extraordinary, splendid, and that might have been hers if fate had willed it.\nThey would have known one another, loved one another. With him, through all the kingdoms of Europe\nshe would have travelled from capital to capital, sharing his fatigues and his pride, picking up the flowers\nthrown to him, herself embroidering his costumes. Then each evening, at the back of a box, behind the\ngolden trellis-work she would have drunk in eagerly the expansions of this soul that would have sung for\nher alone; from the stage, even as he acted, he would have looked at her. But the mad idea seized her that\nhe was looking at her; it was certain. She longed to run to his arms, to take refuge in his strength, as in the\nincarnation of love itself, and to say to him, to cry out, \"Take me away! carry me with you! let us go!\nThine, thine! all my ardour and all my dreams!\"\nThe curtain fell.\nThe smell of the gas mingled with that of the breaths, the waving of the fans, made the air more\nsuffocating. Emma wanted to go out; the crowd filled the corridors, and she fell back in her arm-chair\nwith palpitations that choked her. Charles, fearing that she would faint, ran to the refreshment-room to get\na glass of barley-water.\nHe had great difficulty in getting back to his seat, for his elbows were jerked at every step because of the\nglass he held in his hands, and he even spilt three-fourths on the shoulders of a Rouen lady in short\nsleeves, who feeling the cold liquid running down to her loins, uttered cries like a peacock, as if she were\nbeing assassinated. Her husband, who was a millowner, railed at the clumsy fellow, and while she was\nwith her handkerchief wiping up the stains from her handsome cherry-coloured taffeta gown, he angrily\nmuttered about indemnity, costs, reimbursement. At last Charles reached his wife, saying to her, quite out\nof breath--\n\"Ma foi! I thought I should have had to stay there. There is such a crowd--SUCH a crowd!\"\nHe added--\n\"Just guess whom I met up there! Monsieur Leon!\"\n\"Leon?\"\n\"Himself! He's coming along to pay his respects.\" And as he finished these words the ex-clerk of\nYonville entered the box.\n-126\n\nHe held out his hand with the ease of a gentleman; and Madame Bovary extended hers, without doubt\nobeying the attraction of a stronger will. She had not felt it since that spring evening when the rain fell\nupon the green leaves, and they had said good-bye standing at the window. But soon recalling herself to\nthe necessities of the situation, with an effort she shook off the torpor of her memories, and began\nstammering a few hurried words.\n\"Ah, good-day! What! you here?\"\n\"Silence!\" cried a voice from the pit, for the third act was beginning.\n\"So you are at Rouen?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"And since when?\"\n\"Turn them out! turn them out!\" People were looking at them. They were silent.\nBut from that moment she listened no more; and the chorus of the guests, the scene between Ashton and\nhis servant, the grand duet in D major, all were for her as far off as if the instruments had grown less\nsonorous and the characters more remote. She remembered the games at cards at the druggist's, and the\nwalk to the nurse's, the reading in the arbour, the tete-a-tete by the fireside--all that poor love, so calm\nand so protracted, so discreet, so tender, and that she had nevertheless forgotten. And why had he come\nback? What combination of circumstances had brought him back into her life? He was standing behind\nher, leaning with his shoulder against the wall of the box; now and again she felt herself shuddering\nbeneath the hot breath from his nostrils falling upon her hair.\n\"Does this amuse you?\" said he, bending over her so closely that the end of his moustache brushed her\ncheek. She replied carelessly--\n\"Oh, dear me, no, not much.\"\nThen he proposed that they should leave the theatre and go and take an ice somewhere.\n\"Oh, not yet; let us stay,\" said Bovary. \"Her hair's undone; this is going to be tragic.\"\nBut the mad scene did not at all interest Emma, and the acting of the singer seemed to her exaggerated.\n\"She screams too loud,\" said she, turning to Charles, who was listening.\n\"Yes--a little,\" he replied, undecided between the frankness of his pleasure and his respect for his wife's\nopinion.\nThen with a sigh Leon said--\n\"The heat is--\"\n\"Unbearable! Yes!\"\n\"Do you feel unwell?\" asked Bovary.\n-127\n\n\"Yes, I am stifling; let us go.\"\nMonsieur Leon put her long lace shawl carefully about her shoulders, and all three went off to sit down in\nthe harbour, in the open air, outside the windows of a cafe.\nFirst they spoke of her illness, although Emma interrupted Charles from time to time, for fear, she said, of\nboring Monsieur Leon; and the latter told them that he had come to spend two years at Rouen in a large\noffice, in order to get practice in his profession, which was different in Normandy and Paris. Then he\ninquired after Berthe, the Homais, Mere Lefrancois, and as they had, in the husband's presence, nothing\nmore to say to one another, the conversation soon came to an end.\nPeople coming out of the theatre passed along the pavement, humming or shouting at the top of their\nvoices, \"O bel ange, ma Lucie![17]\" Then Leon, playing the dilettante, began to talk music. He had seen\nTambourini, Rubini, Persiani, Grisi, and, compared with them, Lagardy, despite his grand outbursts, was\nnowhere.\n[17]Oh beautiful angel, my Lucie.\n\"Yet,\" interrupted Charles, who was slowly sipping his rum-sherbet, \"they say that he is quite admirable\nin the last act. I regret leaving before the end, because it was beginning to amuse me.\"\n\"Why,\" said the clerk, \"he will soon give another performance.\"\nBut Charles replied that they were going back next day. \"Unless,\" he added, turning to his wife, \"you\nwould like to stay alone, kitten?\"\nAnd changing his tactics at this unexpected opportunity that presented itself to his hopes, the young man\nsang the praises of Lagardy in the last number. It was really superb, sublime. Then Charles insisted--\n\"You would get back on Sunday. Come, make up your mind. You are wrong if you feel that this is doing\nyou the least good.\"\nThe tables round them, however, were emptying; a waiter came and stood discreetly near them. Charles,\nwho understood, took out his purse; the clerk held back his arm, and did not forget to leave two more\npieces of silver that he made chink on the marble.\n\"I am really sorry,\" said Bovary, \"about the money which you are--\"\nThe other made a careless gesture full of cordiality, and taking his hat said--\n\"It is settled, isn't it? To-morrow at six o'clock?\"\nCharles explained once more that he could not absent himself longer, but that nothing prevented Emma--\n\"But,\" she stammered, with a strange smile, \"I am not sure--\"\n\"Well, you must think it over. We'll see. Night brings counsel.\" Then to Leon, who was walking along\nwith them, \"Now that you are in our part of the world, I hope you'll come and ask us for some dinner now\nand then.\"\nThe clerk declared he would not fail to do so, being obliged, moreover, to go to Yonville on some\n-128\n\nbusiness for his office. And they parted before the Saint-Herbland Passage just as the clock in the\ncathedral struck half-past eleven.\nPART III\nChapter One\nMonsieur Leon, while studying law, had gone pretty often to the dancing-rooms, where he was even a\ngreat success amongst the grisettes, who thought he had a distinguished air. He was the best-mannered of\nthe students; he wore his hair neither too long nor too short, didn't spend all his quarter's money on the\nfirst day of the month, and kept on good terms with his professors. As for excesses, he had always\nabstained from them, as much from cowardice as from refinement.\nOften when he stayed in his room to read, or else when sitting of an evening under the lime-trees of the\nLuxembourg, he let his Code fall to the ground, and the memory of Emma came back to him. But\ngradually this feeling grew weaker, and other desires gathered over it, although it still persisted through\nthem all. For Leon did not lose all hope; there was for him, as it were, a vague promise floating in the\nfuture, like a golden fruit suspended from some fantastic tree.\nThen, seeing her again after three years of absence his passion reawakened. He must, he thought, at last\nmake up his mind to possess her. Moreover, his timidity had worn off by contact with his gay\ncompanions, and he returned to the provinces despising everyone who had not with varnished shoes\ntrodden the asphalt of the boulevards. By the side of a Parisienne in her laces, in the drawing-room of\nsome illustrious physician, a person driving his carriage and wearing many orders, the poor clerk would\nno doubt have trembled like a child; but here, at Rouen, on the harbour, with the wife of this small doctor\nhe felt at his ease, sure beforehand he would shine. Self-possession depends on its environment. We don't\nspeak on the first floor as on the fourth; and the wealthy woman seems to have, about her, to guard her\nvirtue, all her banknotes, like a cuirass in the lining of her corset.\nOn leaving the Bovarys the night before, Leon had followed them through the streets at a distance; then\nhaving seen them stop at the \"Croix-Rouge,\" he turned on his heel, and spent the night meditating a plan.\nSo the next day about five o'clock he walked into the kitchen of the inn, with a choking sensation in his\nthroat, pale cheeks, and that resolution of cowards that stops at nothing.\n\"The gentleman isn't in,\" answered a servant.\nThis seemed to him a good omen. He went upstairs.\nShe was not disturbed at his approach; on the contrary, she apologised for having neglected to tell him\nwhere they were staying.\n\"Oh, I divined it!\" said Leon.\nHe pretended he had been guided towards her by chance, by, instinct. She began to smile; and at once, to\nrepair his folly, Leon told her that he had spent his morning in looking for her in all the hotels in the town\none after the other.\n-129\n\n\"So you have made up your mind to stay?\" he added.\n\"Yes,\" she said, \"and I am wrong. One ought not to accustom oneself to impossible pleasures when there\nare a thousand demands upon one.\"\n\"Oh, I can imagine!\"\n\"Ah! no; for you, you are a man!\"\nBut men too had had their trials, and the conversation went off into certain philosophical reflections.\nEmma expatiated much on the misery of earthly affections, and the eternal isolation in which the heart\nremains entombed.\nTo show off, or from a naive imitation of this melancholy which called forth his, the young man declared\nthat he had been awfully bored during the whole course of his studies. The law irritated him, other\nvocations attracted him, and his mother never ceased worrying him in every one of her letters. As they\ntalked they explained more and more fully the motives of their sadness, working themselves up in their\nprogressive confidence. But they sometimes stopped short of the complete exposition of their thought,\nand then sought to invent a phrase that might express it all the same. She did not confess her passion for\nanother; he did not say that he had forgotten her.\nPerhaps he no longer remembered his suppers with girls after masked balls; and no doubt she did not\nrecollect the rendezvous of old when she ran across the fields in the morning to her lover's house. The\nnoises of the town hardly reached them, and the room seemed small, as if on purpose to hem in their\nsolitude more closely. Emma, in a dimity dressing-gown, leant her head against the back of the old\narm-chair; the yellow wall-paper formed, as it were, a golden background behind her, and her bare head\nwas mirrored in the glass with the white parting in the middle, and the tip of her ears peeping out from the\nfolds of her hair.\n\"But pardon me!\" she said. \"It is wrong of me. I weary you with my eternal complaints.\"\n\"No, never, never!\"\n\"If you knew,\" she went on, raising to the ceiling her beautiful eyes, in which a tear was trembling, \"all\nthat I had dreamed!\"\n\"And I! Oh, I too have suffered! Often I went out; I went away. I dragged myself along the quays, seeking\ndistraction amid the din of the crowd without being able to banish the heaviness that weighed upon me. In\nan engraver's shop on the boulevard there is an Italian print of one of the Muses. She is draped in a tunic,\nand she is looking at the moon, with forget-me-nots in her flowing hair. Something drove me there\ncontinually; I stayed there hours together.\" Then in a trembling voice, \"She resembled you a little.\"\nMadame Bovary turned away her head that he might not see the irrepressible smile she felt rising to her\nlips.\n\"Often,\" he went on, \"I wrote you letters that I tore up.\"\nShe did not answer. He continued--\n\"I sometimes fancied that some chance would bring you. I thought I recognised you at street-corners, and\nI ran after all the carriages through whose windows I saw a shawl fluttering, a veil like yours.\"\n-130\n\nShe seemed resolved to let him go on speaking without interruption. Crossing her arms and bending down\nher face, she looked at the rosettes on her slippers, and at intervals made little movements inside the satin\nof them with her toes.\nAt last she sighed.\n\"But the most wretched thing, is it not--is to drag out, as I do, a useless existence. If our pains were only\nof some use to someone, we should find consolation in the thought of the sacrifice.\"\nHe started off in praise of virtue, duty, and silent immolation, having himself an incredible longing for\nself-sacrifice that he could not satisfy.\n\"I should much like,\" she said, \"to be a nurse at a hospital.\"\n\"Alas! men have none of these holy missions, and I see nowhere any calling--unless perhaps that of a\ndoctor.\"\nWith a slight shrug of her shoulders, Emma interrupted him to speak of her illness, which had almost\nkilled her. What a pity! She should not be suffering now! Leon at once envied the calm of the tomb, and\none evening he had even made his will, asking to be buried in that beautiful rug with velvet stripes he had\nreceived from her. For this was how they would have wished to be, each setting up an ideal to which they\nwere now adapting their past life. Besides, speech is a rolling-mill that always thins out the sentiment.\nBut at this invention of the rug she asked, \"But why?\"\n\"Why?\" He hesitated. \"Because I loved you so!\" And congratulating himself at having surmounted the\ndifficulty, Leon watched her face out of the corner of his eyes.\nIt was like the sky when a gust of wind drives the clouds across. The mass of sad thoughts that darkened\nthem seemed to be lifted from her blue eyes; her whole face shone. He waited. At last she replied--\n\"I always suspected it.\"\nThen they went over all the trifling events of that far-off existence, whose joys and sorrows they had just\nsummed up in one word. They recalled the arbour with clematis, the dresses she had worn, the furniture\nof her room, the whole of her house.\n\"And our poor cactuses, where are they?\"\n\"The cold killed them this winter.\"\n\"Ah! how I have thought of them, do you know? I often saw them again as of yore, when on the summer\nmornings the sun beat down upon your blinds, and I saw your two bare arms passing out amongst the\nflowers.\"\n\"Poor friend!\" she said, holding out her hand to him.\nLeon swiftly pressed his lips to it. Then, when he had taken a deep breath--\n\"At that time you were to me I know not what incomprehensible force that took captive my life. Once, for\ninstance, I went to see you; but you, no doubt, do not remember it.\"\n-131\n\n\"I do,\" she said; \"go on.\"\n\"You were downstairs in the ante-room, ready to go out, standing on the last stair; you were wearing a\nbonnet with small blue flowers; and without any invitation from you, in spite of myself, I went with you.\nEvery moment, however, I grew more and more conscious of my folly, and I went on walking by you, not\ndaring to follow you completely, and unwilling to leave you. When you went into a shop, I waited in the\nstreet, and I watched you through the window taking off your gloves and counting the change on the\ncounter. Then you rang at Madame Tuvache's; you were let in, and I stood like an idiot in front of the\ngreat heavy door that had closed after you.\"\nMadame Bovary, as she listened to him, wondered that she was so old. All these things reappearing\nbefore her seemed to widen out her life; it was like some sentimental immensity to which she returned;\nand from time to time she said in a low voice, her eyes half closed--\n\"Yes, it is true--true--true!\"\nThey heard eight strike on the different clocks of the Beauvoisine quarter, which is full of schools,\nchurches, and large empty hotels. They no longer spoke, but they felt as they looked upon each other a\nbuzzing in their heads, as if something sonorous had escaped from the fixed eyes of each of them. They\nwere hand in hand now, and the past, the future, reminiscences and dreams, all were confounded in the\nsweetness of this ecstasy. Night was darkening over the walls, on which still shone, half hidden in the\nshade, the coarse colours of four bills representing four scenes from the \"Tour de Nesle,\" with a motto in\nSpanish and French at the bottom. Through the sash-window a patch of dark sky was seen between the\npointed roofs.\nShe rose to light two wax-candles on the drawers, then she sat down again.\n\"Well!\" said Leon.\n\"Well!\" she replied.\nHe was thinking how to resume the interrupted conversation, when she said to him--\n\"How is it that no one until now has ever expressed such sentiments to me?\"\nThe clerk said that ideal natures were difficult to understand. He from the first moment had loved her, and\nhe despaired when he thought of the happiness that would have been theirs, if thanks to fortune, meeting\nher earlier, they had been indissolubly bound to one another.\n\"I have sometimes thought of it,\" she went on.\n\"What a dream!\" murmured Leon. And fingering gently the blue binding of her long white sash, he\nadded, \"And who prevents us from beginning now?\"\n\"No, my friend,\" she replied; \"I am too old; you are too young. Forget me! Others will love you; you will\nlove them.\"\n\"Not as you!\" he cried.\n\"What a child you are! Come, let us be sensible. I wish it.\"\n-132\n\nShe showed him the impossibility of their love, and that they must remain, as formerly, on the simple\nterms of a fraternal friendship.\nWas she speaking thus seriously? No doubt Emma did not herself know, quite absorbed as she was by the\ncharm of the seduction, and the necessity of defending herself from it; and contemplating the young man\nwith a moved look, she gently repulsed the timid caresses that his trembling hands attempted.\n\"Ah! forgive me!\" he cried, drawing back.\nEmma was seized with a vague fear at this shyness, more dangerous to her than the boldness of Rodolphe\nwhen he advanced to her open-armed. No man had ever seemed to her so beautiful. An exquisite candour\nemanated from his being. He lowered his long fine eyelashes, that curled upwards. His cheek, with the\nsoft skin reddened, she thought, with desire of her person, and Emma felt an invincible longing to press\nher lips to it. Then, leaning towards the clock as if to see the time--\n\"Ah! how late it is!\" she said; \"how we do chatter!\"\nHe understood the hint and took up his hat.\n\"It has even made me forget the theatre. And poor Bovary has left me here especially for that. Monsieur\nLormeaux, of the Rue Grand-Pont, was to take me and his wife.\"\nAnd the opportunity was lost, as she was to leave the next day.\n\"Really!\" said Leon.\n\"Yes.\"\n\"But I must see you again,\" he went on. \"I wanted to tell you--\"\n\"What?\"\n\"Something--important--serious. Oh, no! Besides, you will not go; it is impossible. If you\nshould--listen to me. Then you have not understood me; you have not guessed--\"\n\"Yet you speak plainly,\" said Emma.\n\"Ah! you can jest. Enough! enough! Oh, for pity's sake, let me see you once--only once!\"\n\"Well--\"She stopped; then, as if thinking better of it, \"Oh, not here!\"\n\"Where you will.\"\n\"Will you--\"She seemed to reflect; then abruptly, \"To-morrow at eleven o'clock in the cathedral.\"\n\"I shall be there,\" he cried, seizing her hands, which she disengaged.\nAnd as they were both standing up, he behind her, and Emma with her head bent, he stooped over her and\npressed long kisses on her neck.\n\"You are mad! Ah! you are mad!\" she said, with sounding little laughs, while the kisses multiplied.\n-133\n\nThen bending his head over her shoulder, he seemed to beg the consent of her eyes. They fell upon him\nfull of an icy dignity.\nLeon stepped back to go out. He stopped on the threshold; then he whispered with a trembling voice,\n\"Tomorrow!\"\nShe answered with a nod, and disappeared like a bird into the next room.\nIn the evening Emma wrote the clerk an interminable letter, in which she cancelled the rendezvous; all\nwas over; they must not, for the sake of their happiness, meet again. But when the letter was finished, as\nshe did not know Leon's address, she was puzzled.\n\"I'll give it to him myself,\" she said; \"he will come.\"\nThe next morning, at the open window, and humming on his balcony, Leon himself varnished his pumps\nwith several coatings. He put on white trousers, fine socks, a green coat, emptied all the scent he had into\nhis handkerchief, then having had his hair curled, he uncurled it again, in order to give it a more natural\nelegance.\n\"It is still too early,\" he thought, looking at the hairdresser's cuckoo-clock, that pointed to the hour of\nnine. He read an old fashion journal, went out, smoked a cigar, walked up three streets, thought it was\ntime, and went slowly towards the porch of Notre Dame.\nIt was a beautiful summer morning. Silver plate sparkled in the jeweller's windows, and the light falling\nobliquely on the cathedral made mirrors of the corners of the grey stones; a flock of birds fluttered in the\ngrey sky round the trefoil bell-turrets; the square, resounding with cries, was fragrant with the flowers that\nbordered its pavement, roses, jasmines, pinks, narcissi, and tube-roses, unevenly spaced out between\nmoist grasses, catmint, and chickweed for the birds; the fountains gurgled in the centre, and under large\numbrellas, amidst melons, piled up in heaps, flower-women, bare-headed, were twisting paper round\nbunches of violets.\nThe young man took one. It was the first time that he had bought flowers for a woman, and his breast, as\nhe smelt them, swelled with pride, as if this homage that he meant for another had recoiled upon himself.\nBut he was afraid of being seen; he resolutely entered the church. The beadle, who was just then standing\non the threshold in the middle of the left doorway, under the \"Dancing Marianne,\" with feather cap, and\nrapier dangling against his calves, came in, more majestic than a cardinal, and as shining as a saint on a\nholy pyx.\nHe came towards Leon, and, with that smile of wheedling benignity assumed by ecclesiastics when they\nquestion children--\n\"The gentleman, no doubt, does not belong to these parts? The gentleman would like to see the curiosities\nof the church?\"\n\"No!\" said the other.\nAnd he first went round the lower aisles. Then he went out to look at the Place. Emma was not coming\nyet. He went up again to the choir.\nThe nave was reflected in the full fonts with the beginning of the arches and some portions of the glass\n-134\n\nwindows. But the reflections of the paintings, broken by the marble rim, were continued farther on upon\nthe flag-stones, like a many-coloured carpet. The broad daylight from without streamed into the church in\nthree enormous rays from the three opened portals. From time to time at the upper end a sacristan passed,\nmaking the oblique genuflexion of devout persons in a hurry. The crystal lustres hung motionless. In the\nchoir a silver lamp was burning, and from the side chapels and dark places of the church sometimes rose\nsounds like sighs, with the clang of a closing grating, its echo reverberating under the lofty vault.\nLeon with solemn steps walked along by the walls. Life had never seemed so good to him. She would\ncome directly, charming, agitated, looking back at the glances that followed her, and with her flounced\ndress, her gold eyeglass, her thin shoes, with all sorts of elegant trifles that he had never enjoyed, and with\nthe ineffable seduction of yielding virtue. The church like a huge boudoir spread around her; the arches\nbent down to gather in the shade the confession of her love; the windows shone resplendent to illumine\nher face, and the censers would burn that she might appear like an angel amid the fumes of the\nsweet-smelling odours.\nBut she did not come. He sat down on a chair, and his eyes fell upon a blue stained window representing\nboatmen carrying baskets. He looked at it long, attentively, and he counted the scales of the fishes and the\nbutton-holes of the doublets, while his thoughts wandered off towards Emma.\nThe beadle, standing aloof, was inwardly angry at this individual who took the liberty of admiring the\ncathedral by himself. He seemed to him to be conducting himself in a monstrous fashion, to be robbing\nhim in a sort, and almost committing sacrilege.\nBut a rustle of silk on the flags, the tip of a bonnet, a lined cloak--it was she! Leon rose and ran to meet\nher.\nEmma was pale. She walked fast.\n\"Read!\" she said, holding out a paper to him. \"Oh, no!\"\nAnd she abruptly withdrew her hand to enter the chapel of the Virgin, where, kneeling on a chair, she\nbegan to pray.\nThe young man was irritated at this bigot fancy; then he nevertheless experienced a certain charm in\nseeing her, in the middle of a rendezvous, thus lost in her devotions, like an Andalusian marchioness; then\nhe grew bored, for she seemed never coming to an end.\nEmma prayed, or rather strove to pray, hoping that some sudden resolution might descend to her from\nheaven; and to draw down divine aid she filled full her eyes with the splendours of the tabernacle. She\nbreathed in the perfumes of the full-blown flowers in the large vases, and listened to the stillness of the\nchurch, that only heightened the tumult of her heart.\nShe rose, and they were about to leave, when the beadle came forward, hurriedly saying--\n\"Madame, no doubt, does not belong to these parts? Madame would like to see the curiosities of the\nchurch?\"\n\"Oh, no!\" cried the clerk.\n\"Why not?\" said she. For she clung with her expiring virtue to the Virgin, the sculptures, the\ntombs--anything.\n-135\n\nThen, in order to proceed \"by rule,\" the beadle conducted them right to the entrance near the square,\nwhere, pointing out with his cane a large circle of block-stones without inscription or carving--\n\"This,\" he said majestically, \"is the circumference of the beautiful bell of Ambroise. It weighed forty\nthousand pounds. There was not its equal in all Europe. The workman who cast it died of the joy--\"\n\"Let us go on,\" said Leon.\nThe old fellow started off again; then, having got back to the chapel of the Virgin, he stretched forth his\narm with an all-embracing gesture of demonstration, and, prouder than a country squire showing you his\nespaliers, went on--\n\"This simple stone covers Pierre de Breze, lord of Varenne and of Brissac, grand marshal of Poitou, and\ngovernor of Normandy, who died at the battle of Montlhery on the 16th of July, 1465.\"\nLeon bit his lips, fuming.\n\"And on the right, this gentleman all encased in iron, on the prancing horse, is his grandson, Louis de\nBreze, lord of Breval and of Montchauvet, Count de Maulevrier, Baron de Mauny, chamberlain to the\nking, Knight of the Order, and also governor of Normandy; died on the 23rd of July, 1531--a Sunday, as\nthe inscription specifies; and below, this figure, about to descend into the tomb, portrays the same person.\nIt is not possible, is it, to see a more perfect representation of annihilation?\"\nMadame Bovary put up her eyeglasses. Leon, motionless, looked at her, no longer even attempting to\nspeak a single word, to make a gesture, so discouraged was he at this two-fold obstinacy of gossip and\nindifference.\nThe everlasting guide went on--\n\"Near him, this kneeling woman who weeps is his spouse, Diane de Poitiers, Countess de Breze, Duchess\nde Valentinois, born in 1499, died in 1566, and to the left, the one with the child is the Holy Virgin. Now\nturn to this side; here are the tombs of the Ambroise. They were both cardinals and archbishops of Rouen.\nThat one was minister under Louis XII. He did a great deal for the cathedral. In his will he left thirty\nthousand gold crowns for the poor.\"\nAnd without stopping, still talking, he pushed them into a chapel full of balustrades, some put away, and\ndisclosed a kind of block that certainly might once have been an ill-made statue.\n\"Truly,\" he said with a groan, \"it adorned the tomb of Richard Coeur de Lion, King of England and Duke\nof Normandy. It was the Calvinists, sir, who reduced it to this condition. They had buried it for spite in\nthe earth, under the episcopal seat of Monsignor. See! this is the door by which Monsignor passes to his\nhouse. Let us pass on quickly to see the gargoyle windows.\"\nBut Leon hastily took some silver from his pocket and seized Emma's arm. The beadle stood\ndumfounded, not able to understand this untimely munificence when there were still so many things for\nthe stranger to see. So calling him back, he cried--\n\"Sir! sir! The steeple! the steeple!\"\n\"No, thank you!\" said Leon.\n-136\n\n\"You are wrong, sir! It is four hundred and forty feet high, nine less than the great pyramid of Egypt. It is\nall cast; it--\"\nLeon was fleeing, for it seemed to him that his love, that for nearly two hours now had become petrified\nin the church like the stones, would vanish like a vapour through that sort of truncated funnel, of oblong\ncage, of open chimney that rises so grotesquely from the cathedral like the extravagant attempt of some\nfantastic brazier.\n\"But where are we going?\" she said.\nMaking no answer, he walked on with a rapid step; and Madame Bovary was already, dipping her finger\nin the holy water when behind them they heard a panting breath interrupted by the regular sound of a\ncane. Leon turned back.\n\"Sir!\"\n\"What is it?\"\nAnd he recognised the beadle, holding under his arms and balancing against his stomach some twenty\nlarge sewn volumes. They were works \"which treated of the cathedral.\"\n\"Idiot!\" growled Leon, rushing out of the church.\nA lad was playing about the close.\n\"Go and get me a cab!\"\nThe child bounded off like a ball by the Rue Quatre-Vents; then they were alone a few minutes, face to\nface, and a little embarrassed.\n\"Ah! Leon! Really--I don't know--if I ought,\" she whispered. Then with a more serious air, \"Do you\nknow, it is very improper--\"\n\"How so?\" replied the clerk. \"It is done at Paris.\"\nAnd that, as an irresistible argument, decided her.\nStill the cab did not come. Leon was afraid she might go back into the church. At last the cab appeared.\n\"At all events, go out by the north porch,\" cried the beadle, who was left alone on the threshold, \"so as to\nsee the Resurrection, the Last Judgment, Paradise, King David, and the Condemned in Hell-flames.\"\n\"Where to, sir?\" asked the coachman.\n\"Where you like,\" said Leon, forcing Emma into the cab.\nAnd the lumbering machine set out. It went down the Rue Grand-Pont, crossed the Place des Arts, the\nQuai Napoleon, the Pont Neuf, and stopped short before the statue of Pierre Corneille.\n\"Go on,\" cried a voice that came from within.\n-137\n\nThe cab went on again, and as soon as it reached the Carrefour Lafayette, set off down-hill, and entered\nthe station at a gallop.\n\"No, straight on!\" cried the same voice.\nThe cab came out by the gate, and soon having reached the Cours, trotted quietly beneath the elm-trees.\nThe coachman wiped his brow, put his leather hat between his knees, and drove his carriage beyond the\nside alley by the meadow to the margin of the waters.\nIt went along by the river, along the towing-path paved with sharp pebbles, and for a long while in the\ndirection of Oyssel, beyond the isles.\nBut suddenly it turned with a dash across Quatremares, Sotteville, La Grande-Chaussee, the Rue\nd'Elbeuf, and made its third halt in front of the Jardin des Plantes.\n\"Get on, will you?\" cried the voice more furiously.\nAnd at once resuming its course, it passed by Saint-Sever, by the Quai'des Curandiers, the Quai aux\nMeules, once more over the bridge, by the Place du Champ de Mars, and behind the hospital gardens,\nwhere old men in black coats were walking in the sun along the terrace all green with ivy. It went up the\nBoulevard Bouvreuil, along the Boulevard Cauchoise, then the whole of Mont-Riboudet to the Deville\nhills.\nIt came back; and then, without any fixed plan or direction, wandered about at hazard. The cab was seen\nat Saint-Pol, at Lescure, at Mont Gargan, at La Rougue-Marc and Place du Gaillardbois; in the Rue\nMaladrerie, Rue Dinanderie, before Saint-Romain, Saint-Vivien, Saint-Maclou, Saint-Nicaise--in front of\nthe Customs, at the \"Vieille Tour,\" the \"Trois Pipes,\" and the Monumental Cemetery. From time to time\nthe coachman, on his box cast despairing eyes at the public-houses. He could not understand what furious\ndesire for locomotion urged these individuals never to wish to stop. He tried to now and then, and at once\nexclamations of anger burst forth behind him. Then he lashed his perspiring jades afresh, but indifferent\nto their jolting, running up against things here and there, not caring if he did, demoralised, and almost\nweeping with thirst, fatigue, and depression.\nAnd on the harbour, in the midst of the drays and casks, and in the streets, at the corners, the good folk\nopened large wonder-stricken eyes at this sight, so extraordinary in the provinces, a cab with blinds\ndrawn, and which appeared thus constantly shut more closely than a tomb, and tossing about like a vessel.\nOnce in the middle of the day, in the open country, just as the sun beat most fiercely against the old plated\nlanterns, a bared hand passed beneath the small blinds of yellow canvas, and threw out some scraps of\npaper that scattered in the wind, and farther off lighted like white butterflies on a field of red clover all in\nbloom.\nAt about six o'clock the carriage stopped in a back street of the Beauvoisine Quarter, and a woman got\nout, who walked with her veil down, and without turning her head.\nChapter Two\nOn reaching the inn, Madame Bovary was surprised not to see the diligence. Hivert, who had waited for\nher fifty-three minutes, had at last started.\nYet nothing forced her to go; but she had given her word that she would return that same evening.\nMoreover, Charles expected her, and in her heart she felt already that cowardly docility that is for some\n-138\n\nwomen at once the chastisement and atonement of adultery.\nShe packed her box quickly, paid her bill, took a cab in the yard, hurrying on the driver, urging him on,\nevery moment inquiring about the time and the miles traversed. He succeeded in catching up the\n\"Hirondelle\" as it neared the first houses of Quincampoix.\nHardly was she seated in her corner than she closed her eyes, and opened them at the foot of the hill,\nwhen from afar she recognised Felicite, who was on the lookout in front of the farrier's shop. Hivert\npulled in his horses and, the servant, climbing up to the window, said mysteriously--\n\"Madame, you must go at once to Monsieur Homais. It's for something important.\"\nThe village was silent as usual. At the corner of the streets were small pink heaps that smoked in the air,\nfor this was the time for jam-making, and everyone at Yonville prepared his supply on the same day. But\nin front of the chemist's shop one might admire a far larger heap, and that surpassed the others with the\nsuperiority that a laboratory must have over ordinary stores, a general need over individual fancy.\nShe went in. The large arm-chair was upset, and even the \"Fanal de Rouen\" lay on the ground, outspread\nbetween two pestles. She pushed open the lobby door, and in the middle of the kitchen, amid brown jars\nfull of picked currants, of powdered sugar and lump sugar, of the scales on the table, and of the pans on\nthe fire, she saw all the Homais, small and large, with aprons reaching to their chins, and with forks in\ntheir hands. Justin was standing up with bowed head, and the chemist was screaming--\n\"Who told you to go and fetch it in the Capharnaum.\"\n\"What is it? What is the matter?\"\n\"What is it?\" replied the druggist. \"We are making preserves; they are simmering; but they were about to\nboil over, because there is too much juice, and I ordered another pan. Then he, from indolence, from\nlaziness, went and took, hanging on its nail in my laboratory, the key of the Capharnaum.\"\nIt was thus the druggist called a small room under the leads, full of the utensils and the goods of his trade.\nHe often spent long hours there alone, labelling, decanting, and doing up again; and he looked upon it not\nas a simple store, but as a veritable sanctuary, whence there afterwards issued, elaborated by his hands, all\nsorts of pills, boluses, infusions, lotions, and potions, that would bear far and wide his celebrity. No one\nin the world set foot there, and he respected it so, that he swept it himself. Finally, if the pharmacy, open\nto all comers, was the spot where he displayed his pride, the Capharnaum was the refuge where,\negoistically concentrating himself, Homais delighted in the exercise of his predilections, so that Justin's\nthoughtlessness seemed to him a monstrous piece of irreverence, and, redder than the currants, he\nrepeated--\n\"Yes, from the Capharnaum! The key that locks up the acids and caustic alkalies! To go and get a spare\npan! a pan with a lid! and that I shall perhaps never use! Everything is of importance in the delicate\noperations of our art! But, devil take it! one must make distinctions, and not employ for almost domestic\npurposes that which is meant for pharmaceutical! It is as if one were to carve a fowl with a scalpel; as if a\nmagistrate--\"\n\"Now be calm,\" said Madame Homais.\nAnd Athalie, pulling at his coat, cried \"Papa! papa!\"\n-139\n\n\"No, let me alone,\" went on the druggist \"let me alone, hang it! My word! One might as well set up for a\ngrocer. That's it! go it! respect nothing! break, smash, let loose the leeches, burn the mallow-paste, pickle\nthe gherkins in the window jars, tear up the bandages!\"\n\"I thought you had--\"said Emma.\n\"Presently! Do you know to what you exposed yourself? Didn't you see anything in the corner, on the\nleft, on the third shelf? Speak, answer, articulate something.\"\n\"I--don't--know,\" stammered the young fellow.\n\"Ah! you don't know! Well, then, I do know! You saw a bottle of blue glass, sealed with yellow wax, that\ncontains a white powder, on which I have even written 'Dangerous!' And do you know what is in it?\nArsenic! And you go and touch it! You take a pan that was next to it!\"\n\"Next to it!\" cried Madame Hoinais, clasping her hands. \"Arsenic! You might have poisoned us all.\"\nAnd the children began howling as if they already had frightful pains in their entrails.\n\"Or poison a patient!\" continued the druggist. \"Do you want to see me in the prisoner's dock with\ncriminals, in a court of justice? To see me dragged to the scaffold? Don't you know what care I take in\nmanaging things, although I am so thoroughly used to it? Often I am horrified myself when I think of my\nresponsibility; for the Government persecutes us, and the absurd legislation that rules us is a veritable\nDamocles' sword over our heads.\"\nEmma no longer dreamed of asking what they wanted her for, and the druggist went on in breathless\nphrases--\n\"That is your return for all the kindness we have shown you! That is how you recompense me for the\nreally paternal care that I lavish on you! For without me where would you be? What would you be doing?\nWho provides you with food, education, clothes, and all the means of figuring one day with honour in the\nranks of society? But you must pull hard at the oar if you're to do that, and get, as, people say, callosities\nupon your hands. Fabricando fit faber, age quod agis.[18]\"\n[18] The worker lives by working, do what he will.\nHe was so exasperated he quoted Latin. He would have quoted Chinese or Greenlandish had he known\nthose two languages, for he was in one of those crises in which the whole soul shows indistinctly what it\ncontains, like the ocean, which, in the storm, opens itself from the seaweeds on its shores down to the\nsands of its abysses.\nAnd he went on--\n\"I am beginning to repent terribly of having taken you up! I should certainly have done better to have left\nyou to rot in your poverty and the dirt in which you were born. Oh, you'll never be fit for anything but to\nherd animals with horns! You have no aptitude for science! You hardly know how to stick on a label!\nAnd there you are, dwelling with me snug as a parson, living in clover, taking your ease!\"\nBut Emma, turning to Madame Homais, \"I was told to come here--\"\n\"Oh, dear me!\" interrupted the good woman, with a sad air, \"how am I to tell you? It is a misfortune!\"\n-140\n\nShe could not finish, the druggist was thundering--\"Empty it! Clean it! Take it back! Be quick!\"\nAnd seizing Justin by the collar of his blouse, he shook a book out of his pocket. The lad stooped, but\nHomais was the quicker, and, having picked up the volume, contemplated it with staring eyes and open\nmouth.\n\"CONJUGAL--LOVE!\" he said, slowly separating the two words. \"Ah! very good! very good! very\npretty! And illustrations! Oh, this is too much!\"\nMadame Homais came forward.\n\"No, do not touch it!\"\nThe children wanted to look at the pictures.\n\"Leave the room,\" he said imperiously; and they went out.\nFirst he walked up and down with the open volume in his hand, rolling his eyes, choking, tumid,\napoplectic. Then he came straight to his pupil, and, planting himself in front of him with crossed arms--\n\"Have you every vice, then, little wretch? Take care! you are on a downward path. Did not you reflect\nthat this infamous book might fall in the hands of my children, kindle a spark in their minds, tarnish the\npurity of Athalie, corrupt Napoleon. He is already formed like a man. Are you quite sure, anyhow, that\nthey have not read it? Can you certify to me--\"\n\"But really, sir,\" said Emma, \"you wished to tell me--\"\n\"Ah, yes! madame. Your father-in-law is dead.\"\nIn fact, Monsieur Bovary senior had expired the evening before suddenly from an attack of apoplexy as\nhe got up from table, and by way of greater precaution, on account of Emma's sensibility, Charles had\nbegged Homais to break the horrible news to her gradually. Homais had thought over his speech; he had\nrounded, polished it, made it rhythmical; it was a masterpiece of prudence and transitions, of subtle turns\nand delicacy; but anger had got the better of rhetoric.\nEmma, giving up all chance of hearing any details, left the pharmacy; for Monsieur Homais had taken up\nthe thread of his vituperations. However, he was growing calmer, and was now grumbling in a paternal\ntone whilst he fanned himself with his skull-cap.\n\"It is not that I entirely disapprove of the work. Its author was a doctor! There are certain scientific points\nin it that it is not ill a man should know, and I would even venture to say that a man must know. But\nlater--later! At any rate, not till you are man yourself and your temperament is formed.\"\nWhen Emma knocked at the door. Charles, who was waiting for her, came forward with open arms and\nsaid to her with tears in his voice--\n\"Ah! my dear!\"\nAnd he bent over her gently to kiss her. But at the contact of his lips the memory of the other seized her,\nand she passed her hand over her face shuddering.\n-141\n\nBut she made answer, \"Yes, I know, I know!\"\nHe showed her the letter in which his mother told the event without any sentimental hypocrisy. She only\nregretted her husband had not received the consolations of religion, as he had died at Daudeville, in the\nstreet, at the door of a cafe after a patriotic dinner with some ex-officers.\nEmma gave him back the letter; then at dinner, for appearance's sake, she affected a certain repugnance.\nBut as he urged her to try, she resolutely began eating, while Charles opposite her sat motionless in a\ndejected attitude.\nNow and then he raised his head and gave her a long look full of distress. Once he sighed, \"I should have\nliked to see him again!\"\nShe was silent. At last, understanding that she must say something, \"How old was your father?\" she\nasked.\n\"Fifty-eight.\"\n\"Ah!\"\nAnd that was all.\nA quarter of an hour after he added, \"My poor mother! what will become of her now?\"\nShe made a gesture that signified she did not know. Seeing her so taciturn, Charles imagined her much\naffected, and forced himself to say nothing, not to reawaken this sorrow which moved him. And, shaking\noff his own--\n\"Did you enjoy yourself yesterday?\" he asked.\n\"Yes.\"\nWhen the cloth was removed, Bovary did not rise, nor did Emma; and as she looked at him, the monotony\nof the spectacle drove little by little all pity from her heart. He seemed to her paltry, weak, a cipher--in a\nword, a poor thing in every way. How to get rid of him? What an interminable evening! Something\nstupefying like the fumes of opium seized her.\nThey heard in the passage the sharp noise of a wooden leg on the boards. It was Hippolyte bringing back\nEmma's luggage. In order to put it down he described painfully a quarter of a circle with his stump.\n\"He doesn't even remember any more about it,\" she thought, looking at the poor devil, whose coarse red\nhair was wet with perspiration.\nBovary was searching at the bottom of his purse for a centime, and without appearing to understand all\nthere was of humiliation for him in the mere presence of this man, who stood there like a personified\nreproach to his incurable incapacity.\n\"Hallo! you've a pretty bouquet,\" he said, noticing Leon's violets on the chimney.\n\"Yes,\" she replied indifferently; \"it's a bouquet I bought just now from a beggar.\"\n-142\n\nCharles picked up the flowers, and freshening his eyes, red with tears, against them, smelt them\ndelicately.\nShe took them quickly from his hand and put them in a glass of water.\nThe next day Madame Bovary senior arrived. She and her son wept much. Emma, on the pretext of giving\norders, disappeared. The following day they had a talk over the mourning. They went and sat down with\ntheir workboxes by the waterside under the arbour.\nCharles was thinking of his father, and was surprised to feel so much affection for this man, whom till\nthen he had thought he cared little about. Madame Bovary senior was thinking of her husband. The worst\ndays of the past seemed enviable to her. All was forgotten beneath the instinctive regret of such a long\nhabit, and from time to time whilst she sewed, a big tear rolled along her nose and hung suspended there a\nmoment. Emma was thinking that it was scarcely forty-eight hours since they had been together, far from\nthe world, all in a frenzy of joy, and not having eyes enough to gaze upon each other. She tried to recall\nthe slightest details of that past day. But the presence of her husband and mother-in-law worried her. She\nwould have liked to hear nothing, to see nothing, so as not to disturb the meditation on her love, that, do\nwhat she would, became lost in external sensations.\nShe was unpicking the lining of a dress, and the strips were scattered around her. Madame Bovary senior\nwas plying her scissor without looking up, and Charles, in his list slippers and his old brown surtout that\nhe used as a dressing-gown, sat with both hands in his pockets, and did not speak either; near them\nBerthe, in a little white pinafore, was raking sand in the walks with her spade. Suddenly she saw\nMonsieur Lheureux, the linendraper, come in through the gate.\nHe came to offer his services \"under the sad circumstances.\" Emma answered that she thought she could\ndo without. The shopkeeper was not to be beaten.\n\"I beg your pardon,\" he said, \"but I should like to have a private talk with you.\" Then in a low voice, \"It's\nabout that affair--you know.\"\nCharles crimsoned to his ears. \"Oh, yes! certainly.\" And in his confusion, turning to his wife, \"Couldn't\nyou, my darling?\"\nShe seemed to understand him, for she rose; and Charles said to his mother, \"It is nothing particular. No\ndoubt, some household trifle.\" He did not want her to know the story of the bill, fearing her reproaches.\nAs soon as they were alone, Monsieur Lheureux in sufficiently clear terms began to congratulate Emma\non the inheritance, then to talk of indifferent matters, of the espaliers, of the harvest, and of his own\nhealth, which was always so-so, always having ups and downs. In fact, he had to work devilish hard,\nalthough he didn't make enough, in spite of all people said, to find butter for his bread.\nEmma let him talk on. She had bored herself so prodigiously the last two days.\n\"And so you're quite well again?\" he went on. \"Ma foi! I saw your husband in a sad state. He's a good\nfellow, though we did have a little misunderstanding.\"\nShe asked what misunderstanding, for Charles had said nothing of the dispute about the goods supplied to\nher.\n\"Why, you know well enough,\" cried Lheureux. \"It was about your little fancies--the travelling trunks.\"\n-143\n\nHe had drawn his hat over his eyes, and, with his hands behind his back, smiling and whistling, he looked\nstraight at her in an unbearable manner. Did he suspect anything?\nShe was lost in all kinds of apprehensions. At last, however, he went on--\n\"We made it up, all the same, and I've come again to propose another arrangement.\"\nThis was to renew the bill Bovary had signed. The doctor, of course, would do as he pleased; he was not\nto trouble himself, especially just now, when he would have a lot of worry. \"And he would do better to\ngive it over to someone else--to you, for example. With a power of attorney it could be easily managed,\nand then we (you and I) would have our little business transactions together.\"\nShe did not understand. He was silent. Then, passing to his trade, Lheureux declared that madame must\nrequire something. He would send her a black barege, twelve yards, just enough to make a gown.\n\"The one you've on is good enough for the house, but you want another for calls. I saw that the very\nmoment that I came in. I've the eye of an American!\"\nHe did not send the stuff; he brought it. Then he came again to measure it; he came again on other\npretexts, always trying to make himself agreeable, useful, \"enfeoffing himself,\" as Homais would have\nsaid, and always dropping some hint to Emma about the power of attorney. He never mentioned the bill;\nshe did not think of it. Charles, at the beginning of her convalescence, had certainly said something about\nit to her, but so many emotions had passed through her head that she no longer remembered it. Besides,\nshe took care not to talk of any money questions. Madame Bovary seemed surprised at this, and attributed\nthe change in her ways to the religious sentiments she had contracted during her illness.\nBut as soon as she was gone, Emma greatly astounded Bovary by her practical good sense. It would be\nnecessary to make inquiries, to look into mortgages, and see if there were any occasion for a sale by\nauction or a liquidation. She quoted technical terms casually, pronounced the grand words of order, the\nfuture, foresight, and constantly exaggerated the difficulties of settling his father's affairs so much, that at\nlast one day she showed him the rough draft of a power of attorney to manage and administer his\nbusiness, arrange all loans, sign and endorse all bills, pay all sums, etc. She had profited by Lheureux's\nlessons. Charles naively asked her where this paper came from.\n\"Monsieur Guillaumin\"; and with the utmost coolness she added, \"I don't trust him overmuch. Notaries\nhave such a bad reputation. Perhaps we ought to consult--we only know--no one.\"\n\"Unless Leon--\" replied Charles, who was reflecting. But it was difficult to explain matters by letter.\nThen she offered to make the journey, but he thanked her. She insisted. It was quite a contest of mutual\nconsideration. At last she cried with affected waywardness--\n\"No, I will go!\"\n\"How good you are!\" he said, kissing her forehead.\nThe next morning she set out in the \"Hirondelle\" to go to Rouen to consult Monsieur Leon, and she\nstayed there three days.\nChapter Three\nThey were three full, exquisite days--a true honeymoon. They were at the Hotel-de-Boulogne, on the\nharbour; and they lived there, with drawn blinds and closed doors, with flowers on the floor, and iced\n-144\n\nsyrups were brought them early in the morning.\nTowards evening they took a covered boat and went to dine on one of the islands. It was the time when\none hears by the side of the dockyard the caulking-mallets sounding against the hull of vessels. The\nsmoke of the tar rose up between the trees; there were large fatty drops on the water, undulating in the\npurple colour of the sun, like floating plaques of Florentine bronze.\nThey rowed down in the midst of moored boats, whose long oblique cables grazed lightly against the\nbottom of the boat. The din of the town gradually grew distant; the rolling of carriages, the tumult of\nvoices, the yelping of dogs on the decks of vessels. She took off her bonnet, and they landed on their\nisland.\nThey sat down in the low-ceilinged room of a tavern, at whose door hung black nets. They ate fried\nsmelts, cream and cherries. They lay down upon the grass; they kissed behind the poplars; and they would\nfain, like two Robinsons, have lived for ever in this little place, which seemed to them in their beatitude\nthe most magnificent on earth. It was not the first time that they had seen trees, a blue sky, meadows; that\nthey had heard the water flowing and the wind blowing in the leaves; but, no doubt, they had never\nadmired all this, as if Nature had not existed before, or had only begun to be beautiful since the\ngratification of their desires.\nAt night they returned. The boat glided along the shores of the islands. They sat at the bottom, both\nhidden by the shade, in silence. The square oars rang in the iron thwarts, and, in the stillness, seemed to\nmark time, like the beating of a metronome, while at the stern the rudder that trailed behind never ceased\nits gentle splash against the water.\nOnce the moon rose; they did not fail to make fine phrases, finding the orb melancholy and full of poetry.\nShe even began to sing--\n\"One night, do you remember, we were sailing,\" etc.\nHer musical but weak voice died away along the waves, and the winds carried off the trills that Leon\nheard pass like the flapping of wings about him.\nShe was opposite him, leaning against the partition of the shallop, through one of whose raised blinds the\nmoon streamed in. Her black dress, whose drapery spread out like a fan, made her seem more slender,\ntaller. Her head was raised, her hands clasped, her eyes turned towards heaven. At times the shadow of\nthe willows hid her completely; then she reappeared suddenly, like a vision in the moonlight.\nLeon, on the floor by her side, found under his hand a ribbon of scarlet silk. The boatman looked at it, and\nat last said--\n\"Perhaps it belongs to the party I took out the other day. A lot of jolly folk, gentlemen and ladies, with\ncakes, champagne, cornets--everything in style! There was one especially, a tall handsome man with\nsmall moustaches, who was that funny! And they all kept saying, 'Now tell us something,\nAdolphe--Dolpe,' I think.\"\nShe shivered.\n\"You are in pain?\" asked Leon, coming closer to her.\n\"Oh, it's nothing! No doubt, it is only the night air.\"\n-145\n\n\"And who doesn't want for women, either,\" softly added the sailor, thinking he was paying the stranger a\ncompliment.\nThen, spitting on his hands, he took the oars again.\nYet they had to part. The adieux were sad. He was to send his letters to Mere Rollet, and she gave him\nsuch precise instructions about a double envelope that he admired greatly her amorous astuteness.\n\"So you can assure me it is all right?\" she said with her last kiss.\n\"Yes, certainly.\"\n\"But why,\" he thought afterwards as he came back through the streets alone, \"is she so very anxious to\nget this power of attorney?\"\nChapter Four\nLeon soon put on an air of superiority before his comrades, avoided their company, and completely\nneglected his work.\nHe waited for her letters; he re-read them; he wrote to her. He called her to mind with all the strength of\nhis desires and of his memories. Instead of lessening with absence, this longing to see her again grew, so\nthat at last on Saturday morning he escaped from his office.\nWhen, from the summit of the hill, he saw in the valley below the church-spire with its tin flag swinging\nin the wind, he felt that delight mingled with triumphant vanity and egoistic tenderness that millionaires\nmust experience when they come back to their native village.\nHe went rambling round her house. A light was burning in the kitchen. He watched for her shadow\nbehind the curtains, but nothing appeared.\nMere Lefrancois, when she saw him, uttered many exclamations. She thought he \"had grown and was\nthinner,\" while Artemise, on the contrary, thought him stouter and darker.\nHe dined in the little room as of yore, but alone, without the tax-gatherer; for Binet, tired of waiting for\nthe \"Hirondelle,\" had definitely put forward his meal one hour, and now he dined punctually at five, and\nyet he declared usually the rickety old concern \"was late.\"\nLeon, however, made up his mind, and knocked at the doctor's door. Madame was in her room, and did\nnot come down for a quarter of an hour. The doctor seemed delighted to see him, but he never stirred out\nthat evening, nor all the next day.\nHe saw her alone in the evening, very late, behind the garden in the lane; in the lane, as she had the other\none! It was a stormy night, and they talked under an umbrella by lightning flashes.\nTheir separation was becoming intolerable. \"I would rather die!\" said Emma. She was writhing in his\narms, weeping. \"Adieu! adieu! When shall I see you again?\"\nThey came back again to embrace once more, and it was then that she promised him to find soon, by no\nmatter what means, a regular opportunity for seeing one another in freedom at least once a week. Emma\nnever doubted she should be able to do this. Besides, she was full of hope. Some money was coming to\nher.\n-146\n\nOn the strength of it she bought a pair of yellow curtains with large stripes for her room, whose cheapness\nMonsieur Lheureux had commended; she dreamed of getting a carpet, and Lheureux, declaring that it\nwasn't \"drinking the sea,\" politely undertook to supply her with one. She could no longer do without his\nservices. Twenty times a day she sent for him, and he at once put by his business without a murmur.\nPeople could not understand either why Mere Rollet breakfasted with her every day, and even paid her\nprivate visits.\nIt was about this time, that is to say, the beginning of winter, that she seemed seized with great musical\nfervour.\nOne evening when Charles was listening to her, she began the same piece four times over, each time with\nmuch vexation, while he, not noticing any difference, cried--\n\"Bravo! very goodl You are wrong to stop. Go on!\"\n\"Oh, no; it is execrable! My fingers are quite rusty.\"\nThe next day he begged her to play him something again.\n\"Very well; to please you!\"\nAnd Charles confessed she had gone off a little. She played wrong notes and blundered; then, stopping\nshort--\n\"Ah! it is no use. I ought to take some lessons; but--\" She bit her lips and added, \"Twenty francs a\nlesson, that's too dear!\"\n\"Yes, so it is--rather,\" said Charles, giggling stupidly. \"But it seems to me that one might be able to do it\nfor less; for there are artists of no reputation, and who are often better than the celebrities.\"\n\"Find them!\" said Emma.\nThe next day when he came home he looked at her shyly, and at last could no longer keep back the words.\n\"How obstinate you are sometimes! I went to Barfucheres to-day. Well, Madame Liegard assured me that\nher three young ladies who are at La Misericorde have lessons at fifty sous apiece, and that from an\nexcellent mistress!\"\nShe shrugged her shoulders and did not open her piano again. But when she passed by it (if Bovary were\nthere), she sighed--\n\"Ah! my poor piano!\"\nAnd when anyone came to see her, she did not fail to inform them she had given up music, and could not\nbegin again now for important reasons. Then people commiserated her--\n\"What a pity! she had so much talent!\"\nThey even spoke to Bovary about it. They put him to shame, and especially the chemist.\n\"You are wrong. One should never let any of the faculties of nature lie fallow. Besides, just think, my\n-147\n\ngood friend, that by inducing madame to study; you are economising on the subsequent musical education\nof your child. For my own part, I think that mothers ought themselves to instruct their children. That is an\nidea of Rousseau's, still rather new perhaps, but that will end by triumphing, I am certain of it, like\nmothers nursing their own children and vaccination.\"\nSo Charles returned once more to this question of the piano. Emma replied bitterly that it would be better\nto sell it. This poor piano, that had given her vanity so much satisfaction--to see it go was to Bovary like\nthe indefinable suicide of a part of herself.\n\"If you liked,\" he said, \"a lesson from time to time, that wouldn't after all be very ruinous.\"\n\"But lessons,\" she replied, \"are only of use when followed up.\"\nAnd thus it was she set about obtaining her husband's permission to go to town once a week to see her\nlover. At the end of a month she was even considered to have made considerable progress.\nChapter Five\nShe went on Thursdays. She got up and dressed silently, in order not to awaken Charles, who would have\nmade remarks about her getting ready too early. Next she walked up and down, went to the windows, and\nlooked out at the Place. The early dawn was broadening between the pillars of the market, and the\nchemist's shop, with the shutters still up, showed in the pale light of the dawn the large letters of his\nsignboard.\nWhen the clock pointed to a quarter past seven, she went off to the \"Lion d'Or,\" whose door Artemise\nopened yawning. The girl then made up the coals covered by the cinders, and Emma remained alone in\nthe kitchen. Now and again she went out. Hivert was leisurely harnessing his horses, listening, moreover,\nto Mere Lefrancois, who, passing her head and nightcap through a grating, was charging him with\ncommissions and giving him explanations that would have confused anyone else. Emma kept beating the\nsoles of her boots against the pavement of the yard.\nAt last, when he had eaten his soup, put on his cloak, lighted his pipe, and grasped his whip, he calmly\ninstalled himself on his seat.\nThe \"Hirondelle\" started at a slow trot, and for about a mile stopped here and there to pick up passengers\nwho waited for it, standing at the border of the road, in front of their yard gates.\nThose who had secured seats the evening before kept it waiting; some even were still in bed in their\nhouses. Hivert called, shouted, swore; then he got down from his seat and went and knocked loudly at the\ndoors. The wind blew through the cracked windows.\nThe four seats, however, filled up. The carriage rolled off; rows of apple-trees followed one upon another,\nand the road between its two long ditches, full of yellow water, rose, constantly narrowing towards the\nhorizon.\nEmma knew it from end to end; she knew that after a meadow there was a sign-post, next an elm, a barn,\nor the hut of a lime-kiln tender. Sometimes even, in the hope of getting some surprise, she shut her eyes,\nbut she never lost the clear perception of the distance to be traversed.\nAt last the brick houses began to follow one another more closely, the earth resounded beneath the\nwheels, the \"Hirondelle\" glided between the gardens, where through an opening one saw statues, a\nperiwinkle plant, clipped yews, and a swing. Then on a sudden the town appeared. Sloping down like an\n-148\n\namphitheatre, and drowned in the fog, it widened out beyond the bridges confusedly. Then the open\ncountry spread away with a monotonous movement till it touched in the distance the vague line of the\npale sky. Seen thus from above, the whole landscape looked immovable as a picture; the anchored ships\nwere massed in one corner, the river curved round the foot of the green hills, and the isles, oblique in\nshape, lay on the water, like large, motionless, black fishes. The factory chimneys belched forth immense\nbrown fumes that were blown away at the top. One heard the rumbling of the foundries, together with the\nclear chimes of the churches that stood out in the mist. The leafless trees on the boulevards made violet\nthickets in the midst of the houses, and the roofs, all shining with the rain, threw back unequal reflections,\naccording to the height of the quarters in which they were. Sometimes a gust of wind drove the clouds\ntowards the Saint Catherine hills, like aerial waves that broke silently against a cliff.\nA giddiness seemed to her to detach itself from this mass of existence, and her heart swelled as if the\nhundred and twenty thousand souls that palpitated there had all at once sent into it the vapour of the\npassions she fancied theirs. Her love grew in the presence of this vastness, and expanded with tumult to\nthe vague murmurings that rose towards her. She poured it out upon the square, on the walks, on the\nstreets, and the old Norman city outspread before her eyes as an enormous capital, as a Babylon into\nwhich she was entering. She leant with both hands against the window, drinking in the breeze; the three\nhorses galloped, the stones grated in the mud, the diligence rocked, and Hivert, from afar, hailed the carts\non the road, while the bourgeois who had spent the night at the Guillaume woods came quietly down the\nhill in their little family carriages.\nThey stopped at the barrier; Emma undid her overshoes, put on other gloves, rearranged her shawl, and\nsome twenty paces farther she got down from the \"Hirondelle.\"\nThe town was then awakening. Shop-boys in caps were cleaning up the shop-fronts, and women with\nbaskets against their hips, at intervals uttered sonorous cries at the corners of streets. She walked with\ndowncast eyes, close to the walls, and smiling with pleasure under her lowered black veil.\nFor fear of being seen, she did not usually take the most direct road. She plunged into dark alleys, and, all\nperspiring, reached the bottom of the Rue Nationale, near the fountain that stands there. It, is the quarter\nfor theatres, public-houses, and whores. Often a cart would pass near her, bearing some shaking scenery.\nWaiters in aprons were sprinkling sand on the flagstones between green shrubs. It all smelt of absinthe,\ncigars, and oysters.\nShe turned down a street; she recognised him by his curling hair that escaped from beneath his hat.\nLeon walked along the pavement. She followed him to the hotel. He went up, opened the door,\nentered--What an embrace!\nThen, after the kisses, the words gushed forth. They told each other the sorrows of the week, the\npresentiments, the anxiety for the letters; but now everything was forgotten; they gazed into each other's\nfaces with voluptuous laughs, and tender names.\nThe bed was large, of mahogany, in the shape of a boat. The curtains were in red levantine, that hung\nfrom the ceiling and bulged out too much towards the bell-shaped bedside; and nothing in the world was\nso lovely as her brown head and white skin standing out against this purple colour, when, with a\nmovement of shame, she crossed her bare arms, hiding her face in her hands.\nThe warm room, with its discreet carpet, its gay ornaments, and its calm light, seemed made for the\nintimacies of passion. The curtain-rods, ending in arrows, their brass pegs, and the great balls of the\nfire-dogs shone suddenly when the sun came in. On the chimney between the candelabra there were two\n-149\n\nof those pink shells in which one hears the murmur of the sea if one holds them to the ear.\nHow they loved that dear room, so full of gaiety, despite its rather faded splendour! They always found\nthe furniture in the same place, and sometimes hairpins, that she had forgotten the Thursday before, under\nthe pedestal of the clock. They lunched by the fireside on a little round table, inlaid with rosewood. Emma\ncarved, put bits on his plate with all sorts of coquettish ways, and she laughed with a sonorous and\nlibertine laugh when the froth of the champagne ran over from the glass to the rings on her fingers. They\nwere so completely lost in the possession of each other that they thought themselves in their own house,\nand that they would live there till death, like two spouses eternally young. They said \"our room,\" \"our\ncarpet,\" she even said \"my slippers,\" a gift of Leon's, a whim she had had. They were pink satin,\nbordered with swansdown. When she sat on his knees, her leg, then too short, hung in the air, and the\ndainty shoe, that had no back to it, was held only by the toes to her bare foot.\nHe for the first time enjoyed the inexpressible delicacy of feminine refinements. He had never met this\ngrace of language, this reserve of clothing, these poses of the weary dove. He admired the exaltation of\nher soul and the lace on her petticoat. Besides, was she not \"a lady\" and a married woman--a real\nmistress, in fine?\nBy the diversity of her humour, in turn mystical or mirthful, talkative, taciturn, passionate, careless, she\nawakened in him a thousand desires, called up instincts or memories. She was the mistress of all the\nnovels, the heroine of all the dramas, the vague \"she\" of all the volumes of verse. He found again on her\nshoulder the amber colouring of the \"Odalisque Bathing\"; she had the long waist of feudal chatelaines,\nand she resembled the \"Pale Woman of Barcelona.\" But above all she was the Angel!\nOften looking at her, it seemed to him that his soul, escaping towards her, spread like a wave about the\noutline of her head, and descended drawn down into the whiteness of her breast. He knelt on the ground\nbefore her, and with both elbows on her knees looked at her with a smile, his face upturned.\nShe bent over him, and murmured, as if choking with intoxication--\n\"Oh, do not move! do not speak! look at me! Something so sweet comes from your eyes that helps me so\nmuch!\"\nShe called him \"child.\" \"Child, do you love me?\"\nAnd she did not listen for his answer in the haste of her lips that fastened to his mouth.\nOn the clock there was a bronze cupid, who smirked as he bent his arm beneath a golden garland. They\nhad laughed at it many a time, but when they had to part everything seemed serious to them.\nMotionless in front of each other, they kept repeating, \"Till Thursday, till Thursday.\"\nSuddenly she seized his head between her hands, kissed him hurriedly on the forehead, crying, \"Adieu!\"\nand rushed down the stairs.\nShe went to a hairdresser's in the Rue de la Comedie to have her hair arranged. Night fell; the gas was\nlighted in the shop. She heard the bell at the theatre calling the mummers to the performance, and she\nsaw, passing opposite, men with white faces and women in faded gowns going in at the stage-door.\nIt was hot in the room, small, and too low where the stove was hissing in the midst of wigs and pomades.\nThe smell of the tongs, together with the greasy hands that handled her head, soon stunned her, and she\n-150\n\ndozed a little in her wrapper. Often, as he did her hair, the man offered her tickets for a masked ball.\nThen she went away. She went up the streets; reached the Croix-Rouge, put on her overshoes, that she\nhad hidden in the morning under the seat, and sank into her place among the impatient passengers. Some\ngot out at the foot of the hill. She remained alone in the carriage. At every turning all the lights of the\ntown were seen more and more completely, making a great luminous vapour about the dim houses. Emma\nknelt on the cushions and her eyes wandered over the dazzling light. She sobbed; called on Leon, sent\nhim tender words and kisses lost in the wind.\nOn the hillside a poor devil wandered about with his stick in the midst of the diligences. A mass of rags\ncovered his shoulders, and an old staved-in beaver, turned out like a basin, hid his face; but when he took\nit off he discovered in the place of eyelids empty and bloody orbits. The flesh hung in red shreds, and\nthere flowed from it liquids that congealed into green scale down to the nose, whose black nostrils sniffed\nconvulsively. To speak to you he threw back his head with an idiotic laugh; then his bluish eyeballs,\nrolling constantly, at the temples beat against the edge of the open wound. He sang a little song as he\nfollowed the carriages--\n\"Maids an the warmth of a summer day Dream of love, and of love always\"\nAnd all the rest was about birds and sunshine and green leaves.\nSometimes he appeared suddenly behind Emma, bareheaded, and she drew back with a cry. Hivert made\nfun of him. He would advise him to get a booth at the Saint Romain fair, or else ask him, laughing, how\nhis young woman was.\nOften they had started when, with a sudden movement, his hat entered the diligence through the small\nwindow, while he clung with his other arm to the footboard, between the wheels splashing mud. His\nvoice, feeble at first and quavering, grew sharp; it resounded in the night like the indistinct moan of a\nvague distress; and through the ringing of the bells, the murmur of the trees, and the rumbling of the\nempty vehicle, it had a far-off sound that disturbed Emma. It went to the bottom of her soul, like a\nwhirlwind in an abyss, and carried her away into the distances of a boundless melancholy. But Hivert,\nnoticing a weight behind, gave the blind man sharp cuts with his whip. The thong lashed his wounds, and\nhe fell back into the mud with a yell. Then the, passengers in the \"Hirondelle\" ended by falling asleep,\nsome with open mouths, others with lowered chins, leaning against their neighbour's shoulder, or with\ntheir arm passed through the strap, oscillating regularly with the jolting of the carriage; and the reflection\nof the lantern swinging without, on the crupper of the wheeler; penetrating into the interior through the\nchocolate calico curtains, threw sanguineous shadows over all these motionless people. Emma, drunk\nwith grief, shivered in her clothes, feeling her feet grow colder and colder, and death in her soul.\nCharles at home was waiting for her; the \"Hirondelle\" was always late on Thursdays. Madame arrived at\nlast, and scarcely kissed the child. The dinner was not ready. No matter! She excused the servant. This\ngirl now seemed allowed to do just as she liked.\nOften her husband, noting her pallor, asked if she were unwell.\n\"No,\" said Emma.\n\"But,\" he replied, \"you seem so strange this evening.\"\n\"Oh, it's nothing! nothing!\"\n-151\n\nThere were even days when she had no sooner come in than she went up to her room; and Justin,\nhappening to be there, moved about noiselessly, quicker at helping her than the best of maids. He put the\nmatches ready, the candlestick, a book, arranged her nightgown, turned back the bedclothes.\n\"Come!\" said she, \"that will do. Now you can go.\"\nFor he stood there, his hands hanging down and his eyes wide open, as if enmeshed in the innumerable\nthreads of a sudden reverie.\nThe following day was frightful, and those that came after still more unbearable, because of her\nimpatience to once again seize her happiness; an ardent lust, inflamed by the images of past experience,\nand that burst forth freely on the seventh day beneath Leon's caresses. His ardours were hidden beneath\noutbursts of wonder and gratitude. Emma tasted this love in a discreet, absorbed fashion, maintained it by\nall the artifices of her tenderness, and trembled a little lest it should be lost later on.\nShe often said to him, with her sweet, melancholy voice--\n\"Ah! you too, you will leave me! You will marry! You will be like all the others.\"\nHe asked, \"What others?\"\n\"Why, like all men,\" she replied. Then added, repulsing him with a languid movement--\n\"You are all evil!\"\nOne day, as they were talking philosophically of earthly disillusions, to experiment on his jealousy, or\nyielding, perhaps, to an over-strong need to pour out her heart, she told him that formerly, before him, she\nhad loved someone.\n\"Not like you,\" she went on quickly, protesting by the head of her child that \"nothing had passed between\nthem.\"\nThe young man believed her, but none the less questioned her to find out what he was.\n\"He was a ship's captain, my dear.\"\nWas this not preventing any inquiry, and, at the same time, assuming a higher ground through this\npretended fascination exercised over a man who must have been of warlike nature and accustomed to\nreceive homage?\nThe clerk then felt the lowliness of his position; he longed for epaulettes, crosses, titles. All that would\nplease her--he gathered that from her spendthrift habits.\nEmma nevertheless concealed many of these extravagant fancies, such as her wish to have a blue tilbury\nto drive into Rouen, drawn by an English horse and driven by a groom in top-boots. It was Justin who had\ninspired her with this whim, by begging her to take him into her service as valet-de-chambre[19], and if\nthe privation of it did not lessen the pleasure of her arrival at each rendezvous, it certainly augmented the\nbitterness of the return.\n[19] Manservant.\n-152\n\nOften, when they talked together of Paris, she ended by murmuring, \"Ah! how happy we should be\nthere!\"\n\"Are we not happy?\" gently answered the young man passing his hands over her hair.\n\"Yes, that is true,\" she said. \"I am mad. Kiss me!\"\nTo her husband she was more charming than ever. She made him pistachio-creams, and played him\nwaltzes after dinner. So he thought himself the most fortunate of men and Emma was without uneasiness,\nwhen, one evening suddenly he said--\n\"It is Mademoiselle Lempereur, isn't it, who gives you lessons?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"Well, I saw her just now,\" Charles went on, \"at Madame Liegeard's. I spoke to her about you, and she\ndoesn't know you.\"\nThis was like a thunderclap. However, she replied quite naturally--\n\"Ah! no doubt she forgot my name.\"\n\"But perhaps,\" said the doctor, \"there are several Demoiselles Lempereur at Rouen who are\nmusic-mistresses.\"\n\"Possibly!\" Then quickly--\"But I have my receipts here. See!\"\nAnd she went to the writing-table, ransacked all the drawers, rummaged the papers, and at last lost her\nhead so completely that Charles earnestly begged her not to take so much trouble about those wretched\nreceipts.\n\"Oh, I will find them,\" she said.\nAnd, in fact, on the following Friday, as Charles was putting on one of his boots in the dark cabinet where\nhis clothes were kept, he felt a piece of paper between the leather and his sock. He took it out and read--\n\"Received, for three months' lessons and several pieces of music, the sum of sixty-three francs.--Felicie\nLempereur, professor of music.\"\n\"How the devil did it get into my boots?\"\n\"It must,\" she replied, \"have fallen from the old box of bills that is on the edge of the shelf.\"\nFrom that moment her existence was but one long tissue of lies, in which she enveloped her love as in\nveils to hide it. It was a want, a mania, a pleasure carried to such an extent that if she said she had the day\nbefore walked on the right side of a road, one might know she had taken the left.\nOne morning, when she had gone, as usual, rather lightly clothed, it suddenly began to snow, and as\nCharles was watching the weather from the window, he caught sight of Monsieur Bournisien in the chaise\nof Monsieur Tuvache, who was driving him to Rouen. Then he went down to give the priesta thick shawl\nthat he was to hand over to Emma as soon as he reached the \"Croix-Rouge.\" When he got to the inn,\n-153\n\nMonsieur Bournisien asked for the wife of the Yonville doctor. The landlady replied that she very rarely\ncame to her establishment. So that evening, when he recognised Madame Bovary in the \"Hirondelle,\" the\ncure told her his dilemma, without, however, appearing to attach much importance to it, for he began\npraising a preacher who was doing wonders at the Cathedral, and whom all the ladies were rushing to\nhear.\nStill, if he did not ask for any explanation, others, later on, might prove less discreet. So she thought well\nto get down each time at the \"Croix-Rouge,\" so that the good folk of her village who saw her on the stairs\nshould suspect nothing.\nOne day, however, Monsieur Lheureux met her coming out of the Hotel de Boulogne on Leon's arm; and\nshe was frightened, thinking he would gossip. He was not such a fool. But three days after he came to her\nroom, shut the door, and said, \"I must have some money.\"\nShe declared she could not give him any. Lheureux burst into lamentations and reminded her of all the\nkindnesses he had shown her.\nIn fact, of the two bills signed by Charles, Emma up to the present had paid only one. As to the second,\nthe shopkeeper, at her request, had consented to replace it by another, which again had been renewed for a\nlong date. Then he drew from his pocket a list of goods not paid for; to wit, the curtains, the carpet, the\nmaterial for the armchairs, several dresses, and divers articles of dress, the bills for which amounted to\nabout two thousand francs.\nShe bowed her head. He went on--\n\"But if you haven't any ready money, you have an estate.\" And he reminded her of a miserable little\nhovel situated at Barneville, near Aumale, that brought in almost nothing. It had formerly been part of a\nsmall farm sold by Monsieur Bovary senior; for Lheureux knew everything, even to the number of acres\nand the names of the neighbours.\n\"If I were in your place,\" he said, \"I should clear myself of my debts, and have money left over.\"\nShe pointed out the difficulty of getting a purchaser. He held out the hope of finding one; but she asked\nhim how she should manage to sell it.\n\"Haven't you your power of attorney?\" he replied.\nThe phrase came to her like a breath of fresh air. \"Leave me the bill,\" said Emma.\n\"Oh, it isn't worth while,\" answered Lheureux.\nHe came back the following week and boasted of having, after much trouble, at last discovered a certain\nLanglois, who, for a long time, had had an eye on the property, but without mentioning his price.\n\"Never mind the price!\" she cried.\nBut they would, on the contrary, have to wait, to sound the fellow. The thing was worth a journey, and, as\nshe could not undertake it, he offered to go to the place to have an interview with Langlois. On his return\nhe announced that the purchaser proposed four thousand francs.\nEmma was radiant at this news.\n-154\n\n\"Frankly,\" he added, \"that's a good price.\"\nShe drew half the sum at once, and when she was about to pay her account the shopkeeper said--\n\"It really grieves me, on my word! to see you depriving yourself all at once of such a big sum as that.\"\nThen she looked at the bank-notes, and dreaming of the unlimited number of rendezvous represented by\nthose two thousand francs, she stammered--\n\"What! what!\"\n\"Oh!\" he went on, laughing good-naturedly, \"one puts anything one likes on receipts. Don't you think I\nknow what household affairs are?\" And he looked at her fixedly, while in his hand he held two long\npapers that he slid between his nails. At last, opening his pocket-book, he spread out on the table four\nbills to order, each for a thousand francs.\n\"Sign these,\" he said, \"and keep it all!\"\nShe cried out, scandalised.\n\"But if I give you the surplus,\" replied Monsieur Lheureux impudently, \"is that not helping you?\"\nAnd taking a pen he wrote at the bottom of the account, \"Received of Madame Bovary four thousand\nfrancs.\"\n\"Now who can trouble you, since in six months you'll draw the arrears for your cottage, and I don't make\nthe last bill due till after you've been paid?\"\nEmma grew rather confused in her calculations, and her ears tingled as if gold pieces, bursting from their\nbags, rang all round her on the floor. At last Lheureux explained that he had a very good friend, Vincart, a\nbroker at Rouen, who would discount these four bills. Then he himself would hand over to madame the\nremainder after the actual debt was paid.\nBut instead of two thousand francs he brought only eighteen hundred, for the friend Vincart (which was\nonly fair) had deducted two hundred francs for commission and discount. Then he carelessly asked for a\nreceipt.\n\"You understand--in business--sometimes. And with the date, if you please, with the date.\"\nA horizon of realisable whims opened out before Emma. She was prudent enough to lay by a thousand\ncrowns, with which the first three bills were paid when they fell due; but the fourth, by chance, came to\nthe house on a Thursday, and Charles, quite upset, patiently awaited his wife's return for an explanation.\nIf she had not told him about this bill, it was only to spare him such domestic worries; she sat on his\nknees, caressed him, cooed to him, gave him a long enumeration of all the indispensable things that had\nbeen got on credit.\n\"Really, you must confess, considering the quantity, it isn't too dear.\"\nCharles, at his wit's end, soon had recourse to the eternal Lheureux, who swore he would arrange matters\nif the doctor would sign him two bills, one of which was for seven hundred francs, payable in three\n-155\n\nmonths. In order to arrange for this he wrote his mother a pathetic letter. Instead of sending a reply she\ncame herself; and when Emma wanted to know whether he had got anything out of her, \"Yes,\" he replied;\n\"but she wants to see the account.\" The next morning at daybreak Emma ran to Lheureux to beg him to\nmake out another account for not more than a thousand francs, for to show the one for four thousand it\nwould be necessary to say that she had paid two-thirds, and confess, consequently, the sale of the\nestate--a negotiation admirably carried out by the shopkeeper, and which, in fact, was only actually\nknown later on.\nDespite the low price of each article, Madame Bovary senior, of course, thought the expenditure\nextravagant.\n\"Couldn't you do without a carpet? Why have recovered the arm-chairs? In my time there was a single\narm-chair in a house, for elderly persons--at any rate it was so at my mother's, who was a good woman, I\ncan tell you. Everybody can't be rich! No fortune can hold out against waste! I should be ashamed to\ncoddle myself as you do! And yet I am old. I need looking after. And there! there! fitting up gowns!\nfallals! What! silk for lining at two francs, when you can get jaconet for ten sous, or even for eight, that\nwould do well enough!\"\nEmma, lying on a lounge, replied as quietly as possible--\"Ah! Madame, enough! enough!\"\nThe other went on lecturing her, predicting they would end in the workhouse. But it was Bovary's fault.\nLuckily he had promised to destroy that power of attorney.\n\"What?\"\n\"Ah! he swore he would,\" went on the good woman.\nEmma opened the window, called Charles, and the poor fellow was obliged to confess the promise torn\nfrom him by his mother.\nEmma disappeared, then came back quickly, and majestically handed her a thick piece of paper.\n\"Thank you,\" said the old woman. And she threw the power of attorney into the fire.\nEmma began to laugh, a strident, piercing, continuous laugh; she had an attack of hysterics.\n\"Oh, my God!\" cried Charles. \"Ah! you really are wrong! You come here and make scenes with her!\"\nHis mother, shrugging her shoulders, declared it was \"all put on.\"\nBut Charles, rebelling for the first time, took his wife's part, so that Madame Bovary, senior, said she\nwould leave. She went the very next day, and on the threshold, as he was trying to detain her, she\nreplied--\n\"No, no! You love her better than me, and you are right. It is natural. For the rest, so much the worse!\nYou will see. Good day--for I am not likely to come soon again, as you say, to make scenes.\"\nCharles nevertheless was very crestfallen before Emma, who did not hide the resentment she still felt at\nhis want of confidence, and it needed many prayers before she would consent to have another power of\nattorney. He even accompanied her to Monsieur Guillaumin to have a second one, just like the other,\ndrawn up.\n-156\n\n\"I understand,\" said the notary; \"a man of science can't be worried with the practical details of life.\"\nAnd Charles felt relieved by this comfortable reflection, which gave his weakness the flattering\nappearance of higher pre-occupation.\nAnd what an outburst the next Thursday at the hotel in their room with Leon! She laughed, cried, sang,\nsent for sherbets, wanted to smoke cigarettes, seemed to him wild and extravagant, but adorable, superb.\nHe did not know what recreation of her whole being drove her more and more to plunge into the pleasures\nof life. She was becoming irritable, greedy, voluptuous; and she walked about the streets with him\ncarrying her head high, without fear, so she said, of compromising herself. At times, however, Emma\nshuddered at the sudden thought of meeting Rodolphe, for it seemed to her that, although they were\nseparated forever, she was not completely free from her subjugation to him.\nOne night she did not return to Yonville at all. Charles lost his head with anxiety, and little Berthe would\nnot go to bed without her mamma, and sobbed enough to break her heart. Justin had gone out searching\nthe road at random. Monsieur Homais even had left his pharmacy.\nAt last, at eleven o'clock, able to bear it no longer, Charles harnessed his chaise, jumped in, whipped up\nhis horse, and reached the \"Croix-Rouge\" about two o'clock in the morning. No one there! He thought\nthat the clerk had perhaps seen her; but where did he live? Happily, Charles remembered his employer's\naddress, and rushed off there.\nDay was breaking, and he could distinguish the escutcheons over the door, and knocked. Someone,\nwithout opening the door, shouted out the required information, adding a few insults to those who disturb\npeople in the middle of the night.\nThe house inhabited by the clerk had neither bell, knocker, nor porter. Charles knocked loudly at the\nshutters with his hands. A policeman happened to pass by. Then he was frightened, and went away.\n\"I am mad,\" he said; \"no doubt they kept her to dinner at Monsieur Lormeaux'.\" But the Lormeaux no\nlonger lived at Rouen.\n\"She probably stayed to look after Madame Dubreuil. Why, Madame Dubreuil has been dead these ten\nmonths! Where can she be?\"\nAn idea occurred to him. At a cafe he asked for a Directory, and hurriedly looked for the name of\nMademoiselle Lempereur, who lived at No. 74 Rue de la Renelle-des-Maroquiniers.\nAs he was turning into the street, Emma herself appeared at the other end of it. He threw himself upon her\nrather than embraced her, crying--\n\"What kept you yesterday?\"\n\"I was not well.\"\n\"What was it? Where? How?\"\nShe passed her hand over her forehead and answered, \"At Mademoiselle Lempereur's.\"\n\"I was sure of it! I was going there.\"\n-157\n\n\"Oh, it isn't worth while,\" said Emma. \"She went out just now; but for the future don't worry. I do not\nfeel free, you see, if I know that the least delay upsets you like this.\"\nThis was a sort of permission that she gave herself, so as to get perfect freedom in her escapades. And she\nprofited by it freely, fully. When she was seized with the desire to see Leon, she set out upon any pretext;\nand as he was not expecting her on that day, she went to fetch him at his office.\nIt was a great delight at first, but soon he no longer concealed the truth, which was, that his master\ncomplained very much about these interruptions.\n\"Pshaw! come along,\" she said.\nAnd he slipped out.\nShe wanted him to dress all in black, and grow a pointed beard, to look like the portraits of Louis XIII.\nShe wanted to see his lodgings; thought them poor. He blushed at them, but she did not notice this, then\nadvised him to buy some curtains like hers, and as he objected to the expense--\n\"Ah! ah! you care for your money,\" she said laughing.\nEach time Leon had to tell her everything that he had done since their last meeting. She asked him for\nsome verses--some verses \"for herself,\" a \"love poem\" in honour of her. But he never succeeded in\ngetting a rhyme for the second verse; and at last ended by copying a sonnet in a \"Keepsake.\" This was\nless from vanity than from the one desire of pleasing her. He did not question her ideas; he accepted all\nher tastes; he was rather becoming her mistress than she his. She had tender words and kisses that thrilled\nhis soul. Where could she have learnt this corruption almost incorporeal in the strength of its profanity\nand dissimulation?\nChapter Six\nDuring the journeys he made to see her, Leon had often dined at the chemist's, and he felt obliged from\npoliteness to invite him in turn.\n\"With pleasure!\" Monsieur Homais replied; \"besides, I must invigorate my mind, for I am getting rusty\nhere. We'll go to the theatre, to the restaurant; we'll make a night of it.\"\n\"Oh, my dear!\" tenderly murmured Madame Homais, alarmed at the vague perils he was preparing to\nbrave.\n\"Well, what? Do you think I'm not sufficiently ruining my health living here amid the continual\nemanations of the pharmacy? But there! that is the way with women! They are jealous of science, and\nthen are opposed to our taking the most legitimate distractions. No matter! Count upon me. One of these\ndays I shall turn up at Rouen, and we'll go the pace together.\"\nThe druggist would formerly have taken good care not to use such an expression, but he was cultivating a\ngay Parisian style, which he thought in the best taste; and, like his neighbour, Madame Bovary, he\nquestioned the clerk curiously about the customs of the capital; he even talked slang to dazzle the\nbourgeois, saying bender, crummy, dandy, macaroni, the cheese, cut my stick and \"I'll hook it,\" for \"I am\ngoing.\"\nSo one Thursday Emma was surprised to meet Monsieur Homais in the kitchen of the \"Lion d'Or,\"\nwearing a traveller's costume, that is to say, wrapped in an old cloak which no one knew he had, while he\n-158\n\ncarried a valise in one hand and the foot-warmer of his establishment in the other. He had confided his\nintentions to no one, for fear of causing the public anxiety by his absence.\nThe idea of seeing again the place where his youth had been spent no doubt excited him, for during the\nwhole journey he never ceased talking, and as soon as he had arrived, he jumped quickly out of the\ndiligence to go in search of Leon. In vain the clerk tried to get rid of him. Monsieur Homais dragged him\noff to the large Cafe de la Normandie, which he entered majestically, not raising his hat, thinking it very\nprovincial to uncover in any public place.\nEmma waited for Leon three quarters of an hour. At last she ran to his office; and, lost in all sorts of\nconjectures, accusing him of indifference, and reproaching herself for her weakness, she spent the\nafternoon, her face pressed against the window-panes.\nAt two o'clock they were still at a table opposite each other. The large room was emptying; the\nstove-pipe, in the shape of a palm-tree, spread its gilt leaves over the white ceiling, and near them, outside\nthe window, in the bright sunshine, a little fountain gurgled in a white basin, where; in the midst of\nwatercress and asparagus, three torpid lobsters stretched across to some quails that lay heaped up in a pile\non their sides.\nHomais was enjoying himself. Although he was even more intoxicated with the luxury than the rich fare,\nthe Pommard wine all the same rather excited his faculties; and when the omelette au rhum[20] appeared,\nhe began propounding immoral theories about women. What seduced him above all else was chic. He\nadmired an elegant toilette in a well-furnished apartment, and as to bodily qualities, he didn't dislike a\nyoung girl.\n[20] In rum.\nLeon watched the clock in despair. The druggist went on drinking, eating, and talking.\n\"You must be very lonely,\" he said suddenly, \"here at Rouen. To be sure your lady-love doesn't live far\naway.\"\nAnd the other blushed--\n\"Come now, be frank. Can you deny that at Yonville--\"\nThe young man stammered something.\n\"At Madame Bovary's, you're not making love to--\"\n\"To whom?\"\n\"The servant!\"\nHe was not joking; but vanity getting the better of all prudence, Leon, in spite of himself protested.\nBesides, he only liked dark women.\n\"I approve of that,\" said the chemist; \"they have more passion.\"\nAnd whispering into his friend's ear, he pointed out the symptoms by which one could find out if a\nwoman had passion. He even launched into an ethnographic digression: the German was vapourish, the\n-159\n\nFrench woman licentious, the Italian passionate.\n\"And negresses?\" asked the clerk.\n\"They are an artistic taste!\" said Homais. \"Waiter! two cups of coffee!\"\n\"Are we going?\" at last asked Leon impatiently.\n\"Ja!\"\nBut before leaving he wanted to see the proprietor of the establishment and made him a few compliments.\nThen the young man, to be alone, alleged he had some business engagement.\n\"Ah! I will escort you,\" said Homais.\nAnd all the while he was walking through the streets with him he talked of his wife, his children; of their\nfuture, and of his business; told him in what a decayed condition it had formerly been, and to what a\ndegree of perfection he had raised it.\nArrived in front of the Hotel de Boulogne, Leon left him abruptly, ran up the stairs, and found his\nmistress in great excitement. At mention of the chemist she flew into a passion. He, however, piled up\ngood reasons; it wasn't his fault; didn't she know Homais--did she believe that he would prefer his\ncompany? But she turned away; he drew her back, and, sinking on his knees, clasped her waist with his\narms in a languorous pose, full of concupiscence and supplication.\nShe was standing; up, her large flashing eyes looked at him seriously, almost terribly. Then tears obscured\nthem, her red eyelids were lowered, she gave him her hands, and Leon was pressing them to his lips when\na servant appeared to tell the gentleman that he was wanted.\n\"You will come back?\" she said.\n\"Yes.\"\n\"But when?\"\n\"Immediately.\"\n\"It's a trick,\" said the chemist, when he saw Leon. \"I wanted to interrupt this visit, that seemed to me to\nannoy you. Let's go and have a glass of garus at Bridoux'.\"\nLeon vowed that he must get back to his office. Then the druggist joked him about quill-drivers and the\nlaw.\n\"Leave Cujas and Barthole alone a bit. Who the devil prevents you? Be a man! Let's go to Bridoux'.\nYou'll see his dog. It's very interesting.\"\nAnd as the clerk still insisted--\n\"I'll go with you. I'll read a paper while I wait for you, or turn over the leaves of a 'Code.'\"\nLeon, bewildered by Emma's anger, Monsieur Homais' chatter, and, perhaps, by the heaviness of the\n-160\n\nluncheon, was undecided, and, as it were, fascinated by the chemist, who kept repeating--\n\"Let's go to Bridoux'. It's just by here, in the Rue Malpalu.\"\nThen, through cowardice, through stupidity, through that indefinable feeling that drags us into the most\ndistasteful acts, he allowed himself to be led off to Bridoux', whom they found in his small yard,\nsuperintending three workmen, who panted as they turned the large wheel of a machine for making\nseltzer-water. Homais gave them some good advice. He embraced Bridoux; they took some garus. Twenty\ntimes Leon tried to escape, but the other seized him by the arm saying--\n\"Presently! I'm coming! We'll go to the 'Fanal de Rouen' to see the fellows there. I'll introduce you to\nThornassin.\"\nAt last he managed to get rid of him, and rushed straight to the hotel. Emma was no longer there. She had\njust gone in a fit of anger. She detested him now. This failing to keep their rendezvous seemed to her an\ninsult, and she tried to rake up other reasons to separate herself from him. He was incapable of heroism,\nweak, banal, more spiritless than a woman, avaricious too, and cowardly.\nThen, growing calmer, she at length discovered that she had, no doubt, calumniated him. But the\ndisparaging of those we love always alienates us from them to some extent. We must not touch our idols;\nthe gilt sticks to our fingers.\nThey gradually came to talking more frequently of matters outside their love, and in the letters that Emma\nwrote him she spoke of flowers, verses, the moon and the stars, naive resources of a waning passion\nstriving to keep itself alive by all external aids. She was constantly promising herself a profound felicity\non her next journey. Then she confessed to herself that she felt nothing extraordinary. This\ndisappointment quickly gave way to a new hope, and Emma returned to him more inflamed, more eager\nthan ever. She undressed brutally, tearing off the thin laces of her corset that nestled around her hips like a\ngliding snake. She went on tiptoe, barefooted, to see once more that the door was closed, then, pale,\nserious, and, without speaking, with one movement, she threw herself upon his breast with a long\nshudder.\nYet there was upon that brow covered with cold drops, on those quivering lips, in those wild eyes, in the\nstrain of those arms, something vague and dreary that seemed to Leon to glide between them subtly as if\nto separate them.\nHe did not dare to question her; but, seeing her so skilled, she must have passed, he thought, through\nevery experience of suffering and of pleasure. What had once charmed now frightened him a little.\nBesides, he rebelled against his absorption, daily more marked, by her personality. He begrudged Emma\nthis constant victory. He even strove not to love her; then, when he heard the creaking of her boots, he\nturned coward, like drunkards at the sight of strong drinks.\nShe did not fail, in truth, to lavish all sorts of attentions upon him, from the delicacies of food to the\ncoquettries of dress and languishing looks. She brought roses to her breast from Yonville, which she\nthrew into his face; was anxious about his health, gave him advice as to his conduct; and, in order the\nmore surely to keep her hold on him, hoping perhaps that heaven would take her part, she tied a medal of\nthe Virgin round his neck. She inquired like a virtuous mother about his companions. She said to him--\n\"Don't see them; don't go out; think only of ourselves; love me!\"\nShe would have liked to be able to watch over his life; and the idea occurred to her of having him\n-161\n\nfollowed in the streets. Near the hotel there was always a kind of loafer who accosted travellers, and who\nwould not refuse. But her pride revolted at this.\n\"Bah! so much the worse. Let him deceive me! What does it matter to me? As If I cared for him!\"\nOne day, when they had parted early and she was returning alone along the boulevard, she saw the walls\nof her convent; then she sat down on a form in the shade of the elm-trees. How calm that time had been!\nHow she longed for the ineffable sentiments of love that she had tried to figure to herself out of books!\nThe first month of her marriage, her rides in the wood, the viscount that waltzed, and Lagardy singing, all\nrepassed before her eyes. And Leon suddenly appeared to her as far off as the others.\n\"Yet I love him,\" she said to herself.\nNo matter! She was not happy--she never had been. Whence came this insufficiency in life--this\ninstantaneous turning to decay of everything on which she leant? But if there were somewhere a being\nstrong and beautiful, a valiant nature, full at once of exaltation and refinement, a poet's heart in an angel's\nform, a lyre with sounding chords ringing out elegiac epithalamia to heaven, why, perchance, should she\nnot find him? Ah! how impossible! Besides, nothing was worth the trouble of seeking it; everything was a\nlie. Every smile hid a yawn of boredom, every joy a curse, all pleasure satiety, and the sweetest kisses left\nupon your lips only the unattainable desire for a greater delight.\nA metallic clang droned through the air, and four strokes were heard from the convent-clock. Four\no'clock! And it seemed to her that she had been there on that form an eternity. But an infinity of passions\nmay be contained in a minute, like a crowd in a small space.\nEmma lived all absorbed in hers, and troubled no more about money matters than an archduchess.\nOnce, however, a wretched-looking man, rubicund and bald, came to her house, saying he had been sent\nby Monsieur Vincart of Rouen. He took out the pins that held together the side-pockets of his long green\novercoat, stuck them into his sleeve, and politely handed her a paper.\nIt was a bill for seven hundred francs, signed by her, and which Lheureux, in spite of all his professions,\nhad paid away to Vincart. She sent her servant for him. He could not come. Then the stranger, who had\nremained standing, casting right and left curious glances, that his thick, fair eyebrows hid, asked with a\nnaive air--\n\"What answer am I to take Monsieur Vincart?\"\n\"Oh,\" said Emma, \"tell him that I haven't it. I will send next week; he must wait; yes, till next week.\"\nAnd the fellow went without another word.\nBut the next day at twelve o'clock she received a summons, and the sight of the stamped paper, on which\nappeared several times in large letters, \"Maitre Hareng, bailiff at Buchy,\" so frightened her that she\nrushed in hot haste to the linendraper's. She found him in his shop, doing up a parcel.\n\"Your obedient!\" he said; \"I am at your service.\"\nBut Lheureux, all the same, went on with his work, helped by a young girl of about thirteen, somewhat\nhunch-backed, who was at once his clerk and his servant.\n-162\n\nThen, his clogs clattering on the shop-boards, he went up in front of Madame Bovary to the first door, and\nintroduced her into a narrow closet, where, in a large bureau in sapon-wood, lay some ledgers, protected\nby a horizontal padlocked iron bar. Against the wall, under some remnants of calico, one glimpsed a safe,\nbut of such dimensions that it must contain something besides bills and money. Monsieur Lheureux, in\nfact, went in for pawnbroking, and it was there that he had put Madame Bovary's gold chain, together\nwith the earrings of poor old Tellier, who, at last forced to sell out, had bought a meagre store of grocery\nat Quincampoix, where he was dying of catarrh amongst his candles, that were less yellow than his face.\nLheureux sat down in a large cane arm-chair, saying: \"What news?\"\n\"See!\"\nAnd she showed him the paper.\n\"Well how can I help it?\"\nThen she grew angry, reminding him of the promise he had given not to pay away her bills. He\nacknowledged it.\n\"But I was pressed myself; the knife was at my own throat.\"\n\"And what will happen now?\" she went on.\n\"Oh, it's very simple; a judgment and then a distraint--that's about it!\"\nEmma kept down a desire to strike him, and asked gently if there was no way of quieting Monsieur\nVincart.\n\"I dare say! Quiet Vincart! You don't know him; he's more ferocious than an Arab!\"\nStill Monsieur Lheureux must interfere.\n\"Well, listen. It seems to me so far I've been very good to you.\" And opening one of his ledgers, \"See,\"\nhe said. Then running up the page with his finger, \"Let's see! let's see! August 3d, two hundred francs;\nJune 17th, a hundred and fifty; March 23d, forty-six. In April--\"\nHe stopped, as if afraid of making some mistake.\n\"Not to speak of the bills signed by Monsieur Bovary, one for seven hundred francs, and another for three\nhundred. As to your little installments, with the interest, why, there's no end to 'em; one gets quite\nmuddled over 'em. I'll have nothing more to do with it.\"\nShe wept; she even called him \"her good Monsieur Lheureux.\" But he always fell back upon \"that rascal\nVincart.\" Besides, he hadn't a brass farthing; no one was paying him now-a-days; they were eating his\ncoat off his back; a poor shopkeeper like him couldn't advance money.\nEmma was silent, and Monsieur Lheureux, who was biting the feathers of a quill, no doubt became\nuneasy at her silence, for he went on--\n\"Unless one of these days I have something coming in, I might--\"\n-163\n\n\"Besides,\" said she, \"as soon as the balance of Barneville--\"\n\"What!\"\nAnd on hearing that Langlois had not yet paid he seemed much surprised. Then in a honied voice--\n\"And we agree, you say?\"\n\"Oh! to anything you like.\"\nOn this he closed his eyes to reflect, wrote down a few figures, and declaring it would be very difficult for\nhim, that the affair was shady, and that he was being bled, he wrote out four bills for two hundred and\nfifty francs each, to fall due month by month.\n\"Provided that Vincart will listen to me! However, it's settled. I don't play the fool; I'm straight enough.\"\nNext he carelessly showed her several new goods, not one of which, however, was in his opinion worthy\nof madame.\n\"When I think that there's a dress at threepence-halfpenny a yard, and warranted fast colours! And yet\nthey actually swallow it! Of course you understand one doesn't tell them what it really is!\" He hoped by\nthis confession of dishonesty to others to quite convince her of his probity to her.\nThen he called her back to show her three yards of guipure that he had lately picked up \"at a sale.\"\n\"Isn't it lovely?\" said Lheureux. \"It is very much used now for the backs of arm-chairs. It's quite the\nrage.\"\nAnd, more ready than a juggler, he wrapped up the guipure in some blue paper and put it in Emma's\nhands.\n\"But at least let me know--\"\n\"Yes, another time,\" he replied, turning on his heel.\nThat same evening she urged Bovary to write to his mother, to ask her to send as quickly as possible the\nwhole of the balance due from the father's estate. The mother-in-law replied that she had nothing more,\nthe winding up was over, and there was due to them besides Barneville an income of six hundred francs,\nthat she would pay them punctually.\nThen Madame Bovary sent in accounts to two or three patients, and she made large use of this method,\nwhich was very successful. She was always careful to add a postscript: \"Do not mention this to my\nhusband; you know how proud he is. Excuse me. Yours obediently.\" There were some complaints; she\nintercepted them.\nTo get money she began selling her old gloves, her old hats, the old odds and ends, and she bargained\nrapaciously, her peasant blood standing her in good stead. Then on her journey to town she picked up\nnick-nacks secondhand, that, in default of anyone else, Monsieur Lheureux would certainly take off her\nhands. She bought ostrich feathers, Chinese porcelain, and trunks; she borrowed from Felicite, from\nMadame Lefrancois, from the landlady at the Croix-Rouge, from everybody, no matter where.\n-164\n\nWith the money she at last received from Barneville she paid two bills; the other fifteen hundred francs\nfell due. She renewed the bills, and thus it was continually.\nSometimes, it is true, she tried to make a calculation, but she discovered things so exorbitant that she\ncould not believe them possible. Then she recommenced, soon got confused, gave it all up, and thought\nno more about it.\nThe house was very dreary now. Tradesmen were seen leaving it with angry faces. Handkerchiefs were\nlying about on the stoves, and little Berthe, to the great scandal of Madame Homais, wore stockings with\nholes in them. If Charles timidly ventured a remark, she answered roughly that it wasn't her fault.\nWhat was the meaning of all these fits of temper? She explained everything through her old nervous\nillness, and reproaching himself with having taken her infirmities for faults, accused himself of egotism,\nand longed to go and take her in his arms.\n\"Ah, no!\" he said to himself; \"I should worry her.\"\nAnd he did not stir.\nAfter dinner he walked about alone in the garden; he took little Berthe on his knees, and unfolding his\nmedical journal, tried to teach her to read. But the child, who never had any lessons, soon looked up with\nlarge, sad eyes and began to cry. Then he comforted her; went to fetch water in her can to make rivers on\nthe sand path, or broke off branches from the privet hedges to plant trees in the beds. This did not spoil\nthe garden much, all choked now with long weeds. They owed Lestiboudois for so many days. Then the\nchild grew cold and asked for her mother.\n\"Call the servant,\" said Charles. \"You know, dearie, that mamma does not like to be disturbed.\"\nAutumn was setting in, and the leaves were already falling, as they did two years ago when she was ill.\nWhere would it all end? And he walked up and down, his hands behind his back.\nMadame was in her room, which no one entered. She stayed there all day long, torpid, half dressed, and\nfrom time to time burning Turkish pastilles which she had bought at Rouen in an Algerian's shop. In\norder not to have at night this sleeping man stretched at her side, by dint of manoeuvring, she at last\nsucceeded in banishing him to the second floor, while she read till morning extravagant books, full of\npictures of orgies and thrilling situations. Often, seized with fear, she cried out, and Charles hurried to\nher.\n\"Oh, go away!\" she would say.\nOr at other times, consumed more ardently than ever by that inner flame to which adultery added fuel,\npanting, tremulous, all desire, she threw open her window, breathed in the cold air, shook loose in the\nwind her masses of hair, too heavy, and, gazing upon the stars, longed for some princely love. She\nthought of him, of Leon. She would then have given anything for a single one of those meetings that\nsurfeited her.\nThese were her gala days. She wanted them to be sumptuous, and when he alone could not pay the\nexpenses, she made up the deficit liberally, which happened pretty well every time. He tried to make her\nunderstand that they would be quite as comfortable somewhere else, in a smaller hotel, but she always\nfound some objection.\n-165\n\nOne day she drew six small silver-gilt spoons from her bag (they were old Roualt's wedding present),\nbegging him to pawn them at once for her, and Leon obeyed, though the proceeding annoyed him. He was\nafraid of compromising himself.\nThen, on, reflection, he began to think his mistress's ways were growing odd, and that they were perhaps\nnot wrong in wishing to separate him from her.\nIn fact someone had sent his mother a long anonymous letter to warn her that he was \"ruining himself\nwith a married woman,\" and the good lady at once conjuring up the eternal bugbear of families the vague\npernicious creature, the siren, the monster, who dwells fantastically in depths of love, wrote to Lawyer\nDubocage, his employer, who behaved perfectly in the affair. He kept him for three quarters of an hour\ntrying to open his eyes, to warn him of the abyss into which he was falling. Such an intrigue would\ndamage him later on, when he set up for himself. He implored him to break with her, and, if he would not\nmake this sacrifice in his own interest, to do it at least for his, Dubocage's sake.\nAt last Leon swore he would not see Emma again, and he reproached himself with not having kept his\nword, considering all the worry and lectures this woman might still draw down upon him, without\nreckoning the jokes made by his companions as they sat round the stove in the morning. Besides, he was\nsoon to be head clerk; it was time to settle down. So he gave up his flute, exalted sentiments, and poetry;\nfor every bourgeois in the flush of his youth, were it but for a day, a moment, has believed himself\ncapable of immense passions, of lofty enterprises. The most mediocre libertine has dreamed of sultanas;\nevery notary bears within him the debris of a poet.\nHe was bored now when Emma suddenly began to sob on his breast, and his heart, like the people who\ncan only stand a certain amount of music, dozed to the sound of a love whose delicacies he no longer\nnoted.\nThey knew one another too well for any of those surprises of possession that increase its joys a\nhundred-fold. She was as sick of him as he was weary of her. Emma found again in adultery all the\nplatitudes of marriage.\nBut how to get rid of him? Then, though she might feel humiliated at the baseness of such enjoyment, she\nclung to it from habit or from corruption, and each day she hungered after them the more, exhausting all\nfelicity in wishing for too much of it. She accused Leon of her baffled hopes, as if he had betrayed her;\nand she even longed for some catastrophe that would bring about their separation, since she had not the\ncourage to make up her mind to it herself.\nShe none the less went on writing him love letters, in virtue of the notion that a woman must write to her\nlover.\nBut whilst she wrote it was another man she saw, a phantom fashioned out of her most ardent memories,\nof her finest reading, her strongest lusts, and at last he became so real, so tangible, that she palpitated\nwondering, without, however, the power to imagine him clearly, so lost was he, like a god, beneath the\nabundance of his attributes. He dwelt in that azure land where silk ladders hang from balconies under the\nbreath of flowers, in the light of the moon. She felt him near her; he was coming, and would carry her\nright away in a kiss.\nThen she fell back exhausted, for these transports of vague love wearied her more than great debauchery.\nShe now felt constant ache all over her. Often she even received summonses, stamped paper that she\nbarely looked at. She would have liked not to be alive, or to be always asleep.\n-166\n\nOn Mid-Lent she did not return to Yonville, but in the evening went to a masked ball. She wore velvet\nbreeches, red stockings, a club wig, and three-cornered hat cocked on one side. She danced all night to the\nwild tones of the trombones; people gathered round her, and in the morning she found herself on the steps\nof the theatre together with five or six masks, debardeuses[21] and sailors, Leon's comrades, who were\ntalking about having supper.\n[21] People dressed as longshoremen.\nThe neighbouring cafes were full. They caught sight of one on the harbour, a very indifferent restaurant,\nwhose proprietor showed them to a little room on the fourth floor.\nThe men were whispering in a corner, no doubt consorting about expenses. There were a clerk, two\nmedical students, and a shopman--what company for her! As to the women, Emma soon perceived from\nthe tone of their voices that they must almost belong to the lowest class. Then she was frightened, pushed\nback her chair, and cast down her eyes.\nThe others began to eat; she ate nothing. Her head was on fire, her eyes smarted, and her skin was\nice-cold. In her head she seemed to feel the floor of the ball-room rebounding again beneath the\nrhythmical pulsation of the thousands of dancing feet. And now the smell of the punch, the smoke of the\ncigars, made her giddy. She fainted, and they carried her to the window.\nDay was breaking, and a great stain of purple colour broadened out in the pale horizon over the St.\nCatherine hills. The livid river was shivering in the wind; there was no one on the bridges; the street\nlamps were going out.\nShe revived, and began thinking of Berthe asleep yonder in the servant's room. Then a cart filled with\nlong strips of iron passed by, and made a deafening metallic vibration against the walls of the houses.\nShe slipped away suddenly, threw off her costume, told Leon she must get back, and at last was alone at\nthe Hotel de Boulogne. Everything, even herself, was now unbearable to her. She wished that, taking\nwing like a bird, she could fly somewhere, far away to regions of purity, and there grow young again.\nShe went out, crossed the Boulevard, the Place Cauchoise, and the Faubourg, as far as an open street that\noverlooked some gardens. She walked rapidly; the fresh air calming her; and, little by little, the faces of\nthe crowd, the masks, the quadrilles, the lights, the supper, those women, all disappeared like mists fading\naway. Then, reaching the \"Croix-Rouge,\" she threw herself on the bed in her little room on the second\nfloor, where there were pictures of the \"Tour de Nesle.\" At four o'clock Hivert awoke her.\nWhen she got home, Felicite showed her behind the clock a grey paper. She read--\n\"In virtue of the seizure in execution of a judgment.\"\nWhat judgment? As a matter of fact, the evening before another paper had been brought that she had not\nyet seen, and she was stunned by these words--\n\"By order of the king, law, and justice, to Madame Bovary.\" Then, skipping several lines, she read,\n\"Within twenty-four hours, without fail--\" But what? \"To pay the sum of eight thousand francs.\" And\nthere was even at the bottom, \"She will be constrained thereto by every form of law, and notably by a writ\nof distraint on her furniture and effects.\"\nWhat was to be done? In twenty-four hours--tomorrow. Lheureux, she thought, wanted to frighten her\n-167\n\nagain; for she saw through all his devices, the object of his kindnesses. What reassured her was the very\nmagnitude of the sum.\nHowever, by dint of buying and not paying, of borrowing, signing bills, and renewing these bills that\ngrew at each new falling-in, she had ended by preparing a capital for Monsieur Lheureux which he was\nimpatiently awaiting for his speculations.\nShe presented herself at his place with an offhand air.\n\"You know what has happened to me? No doubt it's a joke!\"\n\"How so?\"\nHe turned away slowly, and, folding his arms, said to her--\n\"My good lady, did you think I should go on to all eternity being your purveyor and banker, for the love\nof God? Now be just. I must get back what I've laid out. Now be just.\"\nShe cried out against the debt.\n\"Ah! so much the worse. The court has admitted it. There's a judgment. It's been notified to you. Besides,\nit isn't my fault. It's Vincart's.\"\n\"Could you not--?\"\n\"Oh, nothing whatever.\"\n\"But still, now talk it over.\"\nAnd she began beating about the bush; she had known nothing about it; it was a surprise.\n\"Whose fault is that?\" said Lheureux, bowing ironically. \"While I'm slaving like a nigger, you go\ngallivanting about.\"\n\"Ah! no lecturing.\"\n\"It never does any harm,\" he replied.\nShe turned coward; she implored him; she even pressed her pretty white and slender hand against the\nshopkeeper's knee.\n\"There, that'll do! Anyone'd think you wanted to seduce me!\"\n\"You are a wretch!\" she cried.\n\"Oh, oh! go it! go it!\"\n\"I will show you up. I shall tell my husband.\"\n\"All right! I too. I'll show your husband something.\"\n-168\n\nAnd Lheureux drew from his strong box the receipt for eighteen hundred francs that she had given him\nwhen Vincart had discounted the bills.\n\"Do you think,\" he added, \"that he'll not understand your little theft, the poor dear man?\"\nShe collapsed, more overcome than if felled by the blow of a pole-axe. He was walking up and down\nfrom the window to the bureau, repeating all the while--\n\"Ah! I'll show him! I'll show him!\" Then he approached her, and in a soft voice said--\n\"It isn't pleasant, I know; but, after all, no bones are broken, and, since that is the only way that is left for\nyou paying back my money--\"\n\"But where am I to get any?\" said Emma, wringing her hands.\n\"Bah! when one has friends like you!\"\nAnd he looked at her in so keen, so terrible a fashion, that she shuddered to her very heart.\n\"I promise you,\" she said, \"to sign--\"\n\"I've enough of your signatures.\"\n\"I will sell something.\"\n\"Get along!\" he said, shrugging his shoulders; \"you've not got anything.\"\nAnd he called through the peep-hole that looked down into the shop--\n\"Annette, don't forget the three coupons of No. 14.\"\nThe servant appeared. Emma understood, and asked how much money would be wanted to put a stop to\nthe proceedings.\n\"It is too late.\"\n\"But if I brought you several thousand francs--a quarter of the sum--a third--perhaps the whole?\"\n\"No; it's no use!\"\nAnd he pushed her gently towards the staircase.\n\"I implore you, Monsieur Lheureux, just a few days more!\" She was sobbing.\n\"There! tears now!\"\n\"You are driving me to despair!\"\n\"What do I care?\" said he, shutting the door.\nChapter Seven\n-169\n\nShe was stoical the next day when Maitre Hareng, the bailiff, with two assistants, presented himself at her\nhouse to draw up the inventory for the distraint.\nThey began with Bovary's consulting-room, and did not write down the phrenological head, which was\nconsidered an \"instrument of his profession\"; but in the kitchen they counted the plates; the saucepans,\nthe chairs, the candlesticks, and in the bedroom all the nick-nacks on the whatnot. They examined her\ndresses, the linen, the dressing-room; and her whole existence to its most intimate details, was, like a\ncorpse on whom a post-mortem is made, outspread before the eyes of these three men.\nMaitre Hareng, buttoned up in his thin black coat, wearing a white choker and very tight foot-straps,\nrepeated from time to time--\"Allow me, madame. You allow me?\" Often he uttered exclamations.\n\"Charming! very pretty.\" Then he began writing again, dipping his pen into the horn inkstand in his left\nhand.\nWhen they had done with the rooms they went up to the attic. She kept a desk there in which Rodolphe's\nletters were locked. It had to be opened.\n\"Ah! a correspondence,\" said Maitre Hareng, with a discreet smile. \"But allow me, for I must make sure\nthe box contains nothing else.\" And he tipped up the papers lightly, as if to shake out napoleons. Then she\ngrew angered to see this coarse hand, with fingers red and pulpy like slugs, touching these pages against\nwhich her heart had beaten.\nThey went at last. Felicite came back. Emma had sent her out to watch for Bovary in order to keep him\noff, and they hurriedly installed the man in possession under the roof, where he swore he would remain.\nDuring the evening Charles seemed to her careworn. Emma watched him with a look of anguish, fancying\nshe saw an accusation in every line of his face. Then, when her eyes wandered over the chimney-piece\nornamented with Chinese screens, over the large curtains, the armchairs, all those things, in a word, that\nhad, softened the bitterness of her life, remorse seized her or rather an immense regret, that, far from\ncrushing, irritated her passion. Charles placidly poked the fire, both his feet on the fire-dogs.\nOnce the man, no doubt bored in his hiding-place, made a slight noise.\n\"Is anyone walking upstairs?\" said Charles.\n\"No,\" she replied; \"it is a window that has been left open, and is rattling in the wind.\"\nThe next day, Sunday, she went to Rouen to call on all the brokers whose names she knew. They were at\ntheir country-places or on journeys. She was not discouraged; and those whom she did manage to see she\nasked for money, declaring she must have some, and that she would pay it back. Some laughed in her\nface; all refused.\nAt two o'clock she hurried to Leon, and knocked at the door. No one answered. At length he appeared.\n\"What brings you here?\"\n\"Do I disturb you?\"\n\"No; but--\" And he admitted that his landlord didn't like his having \"women\" there.\n\"I must speak to you,\" she went on.\n-170\n\nThen he took down the key, but she stopped him.\n\"No, no! Down there, in our home!\"\nAnd they went to their room at the Hotel de Boulogne.\nOn arriving she drank off a large glass of water. She was very pale. She said to him--\n\"Leon, you will do me a service?\"\nAnd, shaking him by both hands that she grasped tightly, she added\n\"Listen, I want eight thousand francs.\"\n\"But you are mad!\"\n\"Not yet.\"\nAnd thereupon, telling him the story of the distraint, she explained her distress to him; for Charles knew\nnothing of it; her mother-in-law detested her; old Rouault could do nothing; but he, Leon, he would set\nabout finding this indispensable sum.\n\"How on earth can I?\"\n\"What a coward you are!\" she cried.\nThen he said stupidly, \"You are exaggerating the difficulty. Perhaps, with a thousand crowns or so the\nfellow could be stopped.\"\nAll the greater reason to try and do something; it was impossible that they could not find three thousand\nfrancs. Besides, Leon, could be security instead of her.\n\"Go, try, try! I will love you so!\"\nHe went out, and came back at the end of an hour, saying, with solemn face--\n\"I have been to three people with no success.\"\nThen they remained sitting face to face at the two chimney corners, motionless, in silence. Emma\nshrugged her shoulders as she stamped her feet. He heard her murmuring--\n\"If I were in your place I should soon get some.\"\n\"But where?\"\n\"At your office.\" And she looked at him.\nAn infernal boldness looked out from her burning eyes, and their lids drew close together with a\nlascivious and encouraging look, so that the young man felt himself growing weak beneath the mute will\nof this woman who was urging him to a crime. Then he was afraid, and to avoid any explanation he smote\nhis forehead, crying--\n-171\n\n\"Morel is to come back to-night; he will not refuse me, I hope\" (this was one of his friends, the son of a\nvery rich merchant); \"and I will bring it you to-morrow,\" he added.\nEmma did not seem to welcome this hope with all the joy he had expected. Did she suspect the lie? He\nwent on, blushing--\n\"However, if you don't see me by three o'clock do not wait for me, my darling. I must be off now;\nforgive me! Goodbye!\"\nHe pressed her hand, but it felt quite lifeless. Emma had no strength left for any sentiment.\nFour o'clock struck, and she rose to return to Yonville, mechanically obeying the force of old habits.\nThe weather was fine. It was one of those March days, clear and sharp, when the sun shines in a perfectly\nwhite sky. The Rouen folk, in Sunday-clothes, were walking about with happy looks. She reached the\nPlace du Parvis. People were coming out after vespers; the crowd flowed out through the three doors like\na stream through the three arches of a bridge, and in the middle one, more motionless than a rock, stood\nthe beadle.\nThen she remembered the day when, all anxious and full of hope, she had entered beneath this large nave,\nthat had opened out before her, less profound than her love; and she walked on weeping beneath her veil,\ngiddy, staggering, almost fainting.\n\"Take care!\" cried a voice issuing from the gate of a courtyard that was thrown open.\nShe stopped to let pass a black horse, pawing the ground between the shafts of a tilbury, driven by a\ngentleman in sable furs. Who was it? She knew him. The carriage darted by and disappeared.\nWhy, it was he--the Viscount. She turned away; the street was empty. She was so overwhelmed, so sad,\nthat she had to lean against a wall to keep herself from falling.\nThen she thought she had been mistaken. Anyhow, she did not know. All within her and around her was\nabandoning her. She felt lost, sinking at random into indefinable abysses, and it was almost with joy that,\non reaching the \"Croix-Rouge,\" she saw the good Homais, who was watching a large box full of\npharmaceutical stores being hoisted on to the \"Hirondelle.\" In his hand he held tied in a silk handkerchief\nsix cheminots for his wife.\nMadame Homais was very fond of these small, heavy turban-shaped loaves, that are eaten in Lent with\nsalt butter; a last vestige of Gothic food that goes back, perhaps, to the time of the Crusades, and with\nwhich the robust Normans gorged themselves of yore, fancying they saw on the table, in the light of the\nyellow torches, between tankards of hippocras and huge boars' heads, the heads of Saracens to be\ndevoured. The druggist's wife crunched them up as they had done--heroically, despite her wretched\nteeth. And so whenever Homais journeyed to town, he never failed to bring her home some that he bought\nat the great baker's in the Rue Massacre.\n\"Charmed to see you,\" he said, offering Emma a hand to help her into the \"Hirondelle.\" Then he hung up\nhis cheminots to the cords of the netting, and remained bare-headed in an attitude pensive and\nNapoleonic.\nBut when the blind man appeared as usual at the foot of the hill he exclaimed--\n-172\n\n\"I can't understand why the authorities tolerate such culpable industries. Such unfortunates should be\nlocked up and forced to work. Progress, my word! creeps at a snail's pace. We are floundering about in\nmere barbarism.\"\nThe blind man held out his hat, that flapped about at the door, as if it were a bag in the lining that had\ncome unnailed.\n\"This,\" said the chemist, \"is a scrofulous affection.\"\nAnd though he knew the poor devil, he pretended to see him for the first time, murmured something about\n\"cornea,\" \"opaque cornea,\" \"sclerotic,\" \"facies,\" then asked him in a paternal tone--\n\"My friend, have you long had this terrible infirmity? Instead of getting drunk at the public, you'd do\nbetter to die yourself.\"\nHe advised him to take good wine, good beer, and good joints. The blind man went on with his song; he\nseemed, moreover, almost idiotic. At last Monsieur Homais opened his purse--\n\"Now there's a sou; give me back two lairds, and don't forget my advice: you'll be the better for it.\"\nHivert openly cast some doubt on the efficacy of it. But the druggist said that he would cure himself with\nan antiphlogistic pomade of his own composition, and he gave his address--\"Monsieur Homais, near the\nmarket, pretty well known.\"\n\"Now,\" said Hivert, \"for all this trouble you'll give us your performance.\"\nThe blind man sank down on his haunches, with his head thrown back, whilst he rolled his greenish eyes,\nlolled out his tongue, and rubbed his stomach with both hands as he uttered a kind of hollow yell like a\nfamished dog. Emma, filled with disgust, threw him over her shoulder a five-franc piece. It was all her\nfortune. It seemed to her very fine thus to throw it away.\nThe coach had gone on again when suddenly Monsieur Homais leant out through the window, crying--\n\"No farinaceous or milk food, wear wool next the skin, and expose the diseased parts to the smoke of\njuniper berries.\"\nThe sight of the well-known objects that defiled before her eyes gradually diverted Emma from her\npresent trouble. An intolerable fatigue overwhelmed her, and she reached her home stupefied,\ndiscouraged, almost asleep.\n\"Come what may come!\" she said to herself. \"And then, who knows? Why, at any moment could not\nsome extraordinary event occur? Lheureux even might die!\"\nAt nine o'clock in the morning she was awakened by the sound of voices in the Place. There was a crowd\nround the market reading a large bill fixed to one of the posts, and she saw Justin, who was climbing on to\na stone and tearing down the bill. But at this moment the rural guard seized him by the collar. Monsieur\nHomais came out of his shop, and Mere Lefrangois, in the midst of the crowd, seemed to be perorating.\n\"Madame! madame!\" cried Felicite, running in, \"it's abominable!\"\nAnd the poor girl, deeply moved, handed her a yellow paper that she had just torn off the door. Emma\n-173\n\nread with a glance that all her furniture was for sale.\nThen they looked at one another silently. The servant and mistress had no secret one from the other. At\nlast Felicite sighed--\n\"If I were you, madame, I should go to Monsieur Guillaumin.\"\n\"Do you think--\"\nAnd this question meant to say--\n\"You who know the house through the servant, has the master spoken sometimes of me?\"\n\"Yes, you'd do well to go there.\"\nShe dressed, put on her black gown, and her hood with jet beads, and that she might not be seen (there\nwas still a crowd on the Place), she took the path by the river, outside the village.\nShe reached the notary's gate quite breathless. The sky was sombre, and a little snow was falling. At the\nsound of the bell, Theodore in a red waistcoat appeared on the steps; he came to open the door almost\nfamiliarly, as to an acquaintance, and showed her into the dining-room.\nA large porcelain stove crackled beneath a cactus that filled up the niche in the wall, and in black wood\nframes against the oak-stained paper hung Steuben's \"Esmeralda\" and Schopin's \"Potiphar.\" The\nready-laid table, the two silver chafing-dishes, the crystal door-knobs, the parquet and the furniture, all\nshone with a scrupulous, English cleanliness; the windows were ornamented at each corner with stained\nglass.\n\"Now this,\" thought Emma, \"is the dining-room I ought to have.\"\nThe notary came in pressing his palm-leaf dressing-gown to his breast with his left arm, while with the\nother hand he raised and quickly put on again his brown velvet cap, pretentiously cocked on the right\nside, whence looked out the ends of three fair curls drawn from the back of the head, following the line of\nhis bald skull.\nAfter he had offered her a seat he sat down to breakfast, apologising profusely for his rudeness.\n\"I have come,\" she said, \"to beg you, sir--\"\n\"What, madame? I am listening.\"\nAnd she began explaining her position to him. Monsieur Guillaumin knew it, being secretly associated\nwith the linendraper, from whom he always got capital for the loans on mortgages that he was asked to\nmake.\nSo he knew (and better than she herself) the long story of the bills, small at first, bearing different names\nas endorsers, made out at long dates, and constantly renewed up to the day, when, gathering together all\nthe protested bills, the shopkeeper had bidden his friend Vincart take in his own name all the necessary\nproceedings, not wishing to pass for a tiger with his fellow-citizens.\nShe mingled her story with recriminations against Lheureux, to which the notary replied from time to\n-174\n\ntime with some insignificant word. Eating his cutlet and drinking his tea, he buried his chin in his\nsky-blue cravat, into which were thrust two diamond pins, held together by a small gold chain; and he\nsmiled a singular smile, in a sugary, ambiguous fashion. But noticing that her feet were damp, he said--\n\"Do get closer to the stove; put your feet up against the porcelain.\"\nShe was afraid of dirtying it. The notary replied in a gallant tone--\n\"Beautiful things spoil nothing.\"\nThen she tried to move him, and, growing moved herself, she began telling him about the poorness of her\nhome, her worries, her wants. He could understand that; an elegant woman! and, without leaving off\neating, he had turned completely round towards her, so that his knee brushed against her boot, whose sole\ncurled round as it smoked against the stove.\nBut when she asked for a thousand sous, he closed his lips, and declared he was very sorry he had not had\nthe management of her fortune before, for there were hundreds of ways very convenient, even for a lady,\nof turning her money to account. They might, either in the turf-peats of Grumesnil or building-ground at\nHavre, almost without risk, have ventured on some excellent speculations; and he let her consume herself\nwith rage at the thought of the fabulous sums that she would certainly have made.\n\"How was it,\" he went on, \"that you didn't come to me?\"\n\"I hardly know,\" she said.\n\"Why, hey? Did I frighten you so much? It is I, on the contrary, who ought to complain. We hardly know\none another; yet I am very devoted to you. You do not doubt that, I hope?\"\nHe held out his hand, took hers, covered it with a greedy kiss, then held it on his knee; and he played\ndelicately with her fingers whilst he murmured a thousand blandishments. His insipid voice murmured\nlike a running brook; a light shone in his eyes through the glimmering of his spectacles, and his hand was\nadvancing up Emma's sleeve to press her arm. She felt against her cheek his panting breath. This man\noppressed her horribly.\nShe sprang up and said to him--\n\"Sir, I am waiting.\"\n\"For what?\" said the notary, who suddenly became very pale.\n\"This money.\"\n\"But--\" Then, yielding to the outburst of too powerful a desire, \"Well, yes!\"\nHe dragged himself towards her on his knees, regardless of his dressing-gown.\n\"For pity's sake, stay. I love you!\"\nHe seized her by her waist. Madame Bovary's face flushed purple. She recoiled with a terrible look,\ncrying--\n-175\n\n\"You are taking a shameless advantage of my distress, sir! I am to be pitied--not to be sold.\"\nAnd she went out.\nThe notary remained quite stupefied, his eyes fixed on his fine embroidered slippers. They were a love\ngift, and the sight of them at last consoled him. Besides, he reflected that such an adventure might have\ncarried him too far.\n\"What a wretch! what a scoundrel! what an infamy!\" she said to herself, as she fled with nervous steps\nbeneath the aspens of the path. The disappointment of her failure increased the indignation of her\noutraged modesty; it seemed to her that Providence pursued her implacably, and, strengthening herself in\nher pride, she had never felt so much esteem for herself nor so much contempt for others. A spirit of\nwarfare transformed her. She would have liked to strike all men, to spit in their faces, to crush them, and\nshe walked rapidly straight on, pale, quivering, maddened, searching the empty horizon with tear-dimmed\neyes, and as it were rejoicing in the hate that was choking her.\nWhen she saw her house a numbness came over her. She could not go on; and yet she must. Besides,\nwhither could she flee?\nFelicite was waiting for her at the door. \"Well?\"\n\"No!\" said Emma.\nAnd for a quarter of an hour the two of them went over the various persons in Yonville who might\nperhaps be inclined to help her. But each time that Felicite named someone Emma replied--\n\"Impossible! they will not!\"\n\"And the master'll soon be in.\"\n\"I know that well enough. Leave me alone.\"\nShe had tried everything; there was nothing more to be done now; and when Charles came in she would\nhave to say to him--\n\"Go away! This carpet on which you are walking is no longer ours. In your own house you do not possess\na chair, a pin, a straw, and it is I, poor man, who have ruined you.\"\nThen there would be a great sob; next he would weep abundantly, and at last, the surprise past, he would\nforgive her.\n\"Yes,\" she murmured, grinding her teeth, \"he will forgive me, he who would give a million if I would\nforgive him for having known me! Never! never!\"\nThis thought of Bovary's superiority to her exasperated her. Then, whether she confessed or did not\nconfess, presently, immediately, to-morrow, he would know the catastrophe all the same; so she must wait\nfor this horrible scene, and bear the weight of his magnanimity. The desire to return to Lheureux's seized\nher--what would be the use? To write to her father--it was too late; and perhaps, she began to repent\nnow that she had not yielded to that other, when she heard the trot of a horse in the alley. It was he; he\nwas opening the gate; he was whiter than the plaster wall. Rushing to the stairs, she ran out quickly to the\nsquare; and the wife of the mayor, who was talking to Lestiboudois in front of the church, saw her go in\n-176\n\nto the tax-collector's.\nShe hurried off to tell Madame Caron, and the two ladies went up to the attic, and, hidden by some linen\nspread across props, stationed themselves comfortably for overlooking the whole of Binet's room.\nHe was alone in his garret, busy imitating in wood one of those indescribable bits of ivory, composed of\ncrescents, of spheres hollowed out one within the other, the whole as straight as an obelisk, and of no use\nwhatever; and he was beginning on the last piece--he was nearing his goal. In the twilight of the\nworkshop the white dust was flying from his tools like a shower of sparks under the hoofs of a galloping\nhorse; the two wheels were turning, droning; Binet smiled, his chin lowered, his nostrils distended, and, in\na word, seemed lost in one of those complete happinesses that, no doubt, belong only to commonplace\noccupations, which amuse the mind with facile difficulties, and satisfy by a realisation of that beyond\nwhich such minds have not a dream.\n\"Ah! there she is!\" exclaimed Madame Tuvache.\nBut it was impossible because of the lathe to hear what she was saying.\nAt last these ladies thought they made out the word \"francs,\" and Madame Tuvache whispered in a low\nvoice--\n\"She is begging him to give her time for paying her taxes.\"\n\"Apparently!\" replied the other.\nThey saw her walking up and down, examining the napkin-rings, the candlesticks, the banister rails\nagainst the walls, while Binet stroked his beard with satisfaction.\n\"Do you think she wants to order something of him?\" said Madame Tuvache.\n\"Why, he doesn't sell anything,\" objected her neighbour.\nThe tax-collector seemed to be listening with wide-open eyes, as if he did not understand. She went on in\na tender, suppliant manner. She came nearer to him, her breast heaving; they no longer spoke.\n\"Is she making him advances?\" said Madame Tuvache. Binet was scarlet to his very ears. She took hold\nof his hands.\n\"Oh, it's too much!\"\nAnd no doubt she was suggesting something abominable to him; for the tax-collector--yet he was brave,\nhad fought at Bautzen and at Lutzen, had been through the French campaign, and had even been\nrecommended for the cross--suddenly, as at the sight of a serpent, recoiled as far as he could from her,\ncrying--\n\"Madame! what do you mean?\"\n\"Women like that ought to be whipped,\" said Madame Tuvache.\n\"But where is she?\" continued Madame Caron, for she had disappeared whilst they spoke; then catching\nsight of her going up the Grande Rue, and turning to the right as if making for the cemetery, they were\n-177\n\nlost in conjectures.\n\"Nurse Rollet,\" she said on reaching the nurse's, \"I am choking; unlace me!\" She fell on the bed sobbing.\nNurse Rollet covered her with a petticoat and remained standing by her side. Then, as she did not answer,\nthe good woman withdrew, took her wheel and began spinning flax.\n\"Oh, leave off!\" she murmured, fancying she heard Binet's lathe.\n\"What's bothering her?\" said the nurse to herself. \"Why has she come here?\"\nShe had rushed thither; impelled by a kind of horror that drove her from her home.\nLying on her back, motionless, and with staring eyes, she saw things but vaguely, although she tried to\nwith idiotic persistence. She looked at the scales on the walls, two brands smoking end to end, and a long\nspider crawling over her head in a rent in the beam. At last she began to collect her thoughts. She\nremembered--one day--Leon--Oh! how long ago that was--the sun was shining on the river, and the\nclematis were perfuming the air. Then, carried away as by a rushing torrent, she soon began to recall the\nday before.\n\"What time is it?\" she asked.\nMere Rollet went out, raised the fingers of her right hand to that side of the sky that was brightest, and\ncame back slowly, saying--\n\"Nearly three.\"\n\"Ahl thanks, thanks!\"\nFor he would come; he would have found some money. But he would, perhaps, go down yonder, not\nguessing she was here, and she told the nurse to run to her house to fetch him.\n\"Be quick!\"\n\"But, my dear lady, I'm going, I'm going!\"\nShe wondered now that she had not thought of him from the first. Yesterday he had given his word; he\nwould not break it. And she already saw herself at Lheureux's spreading out her three bank-notes on his\nbureau. Then she would have to invent some story to explain matters to Bovary. What should it be?\nThe nurse, however, was a long while gone. But, as there was no clock in the cot, Emma feared she was\nperhaps exaggerating the length of time. She began walking round the garden, step by step; she went into\nthe path by the hedge, and returned quickly, hoping that the woman would have come back by another\nroad. At last, weary of waiting, assailed by fears that she thrust from her, no longer conscious whether she\nhad been here a century or a moment, she sat down in a corner, closed her eyes, and stopped her ears. The\ngate grated; she sprang up. Before she had spoken Mere Rollet said to her--\n\"There is no one at your house!\"\n\"What?\"\n\"Oh, no one! And the doctor is crying. He is calling for you; they're looking for you.\"\n-178\n\nEmma answered nothing. She gasped as she turned her eyes about her, while the peasant woman,\nfrightened at her face, drew back instinctively, thinking her mad. Suddenly she struck her brow and\nuttered a cry; for the thought of Rodolphe, like a flash of lightning in a dark night, had passed into her\nsoul. He was so good, so delicate, so generous! And besides, should he hesitate to do her this service, she\nwould know well enough how to constrain him to it by re-waking, in a single moment, their lost love. So\nshe set out towards La Huchette, not seeing that she was hastening to offer herself to that which but a\nwhile ago had so angered her, not in the least conscious of her prostitution.\nChapter Eight\nShe asked herself as she walked along, \"What am I going to say? How shall I begin?\" And as she went on\nshe recognised the thickets, the trees, the sea-rushes on the hill, the chateau yonder. All the sensations of\nher first tenderness came back to her, and her poor aching heart opened out amorously. A warm wind\nblew in her face; the melting snow fell drop by drop from the buds to the grass.\nShe entered, as she used to, through the small park-gate. She reached the avenue bordered by a double\nrow of dense lime-trees. They were swaying their long whispering branches to and fro. The dogs in their\nkennels all barked, and the noise of their voices resounded, but brought out no one.\nShe went up the large straight staircase with wooden balusters that led to the corridor paved with dusty\nflags, into which several doors in a row opened, as in a monastery or an inn. His was at the top, right at\nthe end, on the left. When she placed her fingers on the lock her strength suddenly deserted her. She was\nafraid, almost wished he would not be there, though this was her only hope, her last chance of salvation.\nShe collected her thoughts for one moment, and, strengthening herself by the feeling of present necessity,\nwent in.\nHe was in front of the fire, both his feet on the mantelpiece, smoking a pipe.\n\"What! it is you!\" he said, getting up hurriedly.\n\"Yes, it is I, Rodolphe. I should like to ask your advice.\"\nAnd, despite all her efforts, it was impossible for her to open her lips.\n\"You have not changed; you are charming as ever!\"\n\"Oh,\" she replied bitterly, \"they are poor charms since you disdained them.\"\nThen he began a long explanation of his conduct, excusing himself in vague terms, in default of being\nable to invent better.\nShe yielded to his words, still more to his voice and the sight of him, so that, she pretended to believe, or\nperhaps believed; in the pretext he gave for their rupture; this was a secret on which depended the honour,\nthe very life of a third person.\n\"No matter!\" she said, looking at him sadly. \"I have suffered much.\"\nHe replied philosophically--\n\"Such is life!\"\n\"Has life,\" Emma went on, \"been good to you at least, since our separation?\"\n-179\n\n\"Oh, neither good nor bad.\"\n\"Perhaps it would have been better never to have parted.\"\n\"Yes, perhaps.\"\n\"You think so?\" she said, drawing nearer, and she sighed. \"Oh, Rodolphe! if you but knew! I loved you\nso!\"\nIt was then that she took his hand, and they remained some time, their fingers intertwined, like that first\nday at the Show. With a gesture of pride he struggled against this emotion. But sinking upon his breast\nshe said to him--\n\"How did you think I could live without you? One cannot lose the habit of happiness. I was desolate. I\nthought I should die. I will tell you about all that and you will see. And you--you fled from me!\"\nFor, all the three years, he had carefully avoided her in consequence of that natural cowardice that\ncharacterises the stronger sex. Emma went on, with dainty little nods, more coaxing than an amorous\nkitten--\n\"You love others, confess it! Oh, I understand them, dear! I excuse them. You probably seduced them as\nyou seduced me. You are indeed a man; you have everything to make one love you. But we'll begin\nagain, won't we? We will love one another. See! I am laughing; I am happy! Oh, speak!\"\nAnd she was charming to see, with her eyes, in which trembled a tear, like the rain of a storm in a blue\ncorolla.\nHe had drawn her upon his knees, and with the back of his hand was caressing her smooth hair, where in\nthe twilight was mirrored like a golden arrow one last ray of the sun. She bent down her brow; at last he\nkissed her on the eyelids quite gently with the tips of his lips.\n\"Why, you have been crying! What for?\"\nShe burst into tears. Rodolphe thought this was an outburst of her love. As she did not speak, he took this\nsilence for a last remnant of resistance, and then he cried out--\n\"Oh, forgive me! You are the only one who pleases me. I was imbecile and cruel. I love you. I will love\nyou always. What is it. Tell me!\" He was kneeling by her.\n\"Well, I am ruined, Rodolphe! You must lend me three thousand francs.\"\n\"But--but--\" said he, getting up slowly, while his face assumed a grave expression.\n\"You know,\" she went on quickly, \"that my husband had placed his whole fortune at a notary's. He ran\naway. So we borrowed; the patients don't pay us. Moreover, the settling of the estate is not yet done; we\nshall have the money later on. But to-day, for want of three thousand francs, we are to be sold up. It is to\nbe at once, this very moment, and, counting upon your friendship, I have come to you.\"\n\"Ah!\" thought Rodolphe, turning very pale, \"that was what she came for.\" At last he said with a calm\nair--\n-180\n\n\"Dear madame, I have not got them.\"\nHe did not lie. If he had had them, he would, no doubt, have given them, although it is generally\ndisagreeable to do such fine things: a demand for money being, of all the winds that blow upon love, the\ncoldest and most destructive.\nFirst she looked at him for some moments.\n\"You have not got them!\" she repeated several times. \"You have not got them! I ought to have spared\nmyself this last shame. You never loved me. You are no better than the others.\"\nShe was betraying, ruining herself.\nRodolphe interrupted her, declaring he was \"hard up\" himself.\n\"Ah! I pity you,\" said Emma. \"Yes--very much.\"\nAnd fixing her eyes upon an embossed carabine, that shone against its panoply, \"But when one is so poor\none doesn't have silver on the butt of one's gun. One doesn't buy a clock inlaid with tortoise shell,\" she\nwent on, pointing to a buhl timepiece, \"nor silver-gilt whistles for one's whips,\" and she touched them,\n\"nor charms for one's watch. Oh, he wants for nothing! even to a liqueur-stand in his room! For you love\nyourself; you live well. You have a chateau, farms, woods; you go hunting; you travel to Paris. Why, if it\nwere but that,\" she cried, taking up two studs from the mantelpiece, \"but the least of these trifles, one can\nget money for them. Oh, I do not want them, keep them!\"\nAnd she threw the two links away from her, their gold chain breaking as it struck against the wall.\n\"But I! I would have given you everything. I would have sold all, worked for you with my hands, I would\nhave begged on the highroads for a smile, for a look, to hear you say 'Thanks!' And you sit there quietly\nin your arm-chair, as if you had not made me suffer enough already! But for you, and you know it, I\nmight have lived happily. What made you do it? Was it a bet? Yet you loved me--you said so. And but a\nmoment since--Ah! it would have been better to have driven me away. My hands are hot with your\nkisses, and there is the spot on the carpet where at my knees you swore an eternity of love! You made me\nbelieve you; for two years you held me in the most magnificent, the sweetest dream! Eh! Our plans for the\njourney, do you remember? Oh, your letter! your letter! it tore my heart! And then when I come back to\nhim--to him, rich, happy, free--to implore the help the first stranger would give, a suppliant, and\nbringing back to him all my tenderness, he repulses me because it would cost him three thousand francs!\"\n\"I haven't got them,\" replied Rodolphe, with that perfect calm with which resigned rage covers itself as\nwith a shield.\nShe went out. The walls trembled, the ceiling was crushing her, and she passed back through the long\nalley, stumbling against the heaps of dead leaves scattered by the wind. At last she reached the ha-ha\nhedge in front of the gate; she broke her nails against the lock in her haste to open it. Then a hundred\nsteps farther on, breathless, almost falling, she stopped. And now turning round, she once more saw the\nimpassive chateau, with the park, the gardens, the three courts, and all the windows of the facade.\nShe remained lost in stupor, and having no more consciousness of herself than through the beating of her\narteries, that she seemed to hear bursting forth like a deafening music filling all the fields. The earth\nbeneath her feet was more yielding than the sea, and the furrows seemed to her immense brown waves\nbreaking into foam. Everything in her head, of memories, ideas, went off at once like a thousand pieces of\n-181\n\nfireworks. She saw her father, Lheureux's closet, their room at home, another landscape. Madness was\ncoming upon her; she grew afraid, and managed to recover herself, in a confused way, it is true, for she\ndid not in the, least remember the cause of the terrible condition she was in, that is to say, the question of\nmoney. She suffered only in her love, and felt her soul passing from her in this memory; as wounded\nmen, dying, feel their life ebb from their bleeding wounds.\nNight was falling, crows were flying about.\nSuddenly it seemed to her that fiery spheres were exploding in the air like fulminating balls when they\nstrike, and were whirling, whirling, to melt at last upon the snow between the branches of the trees. In the\nmidst of each of them appeared the face of Rodolphe. They multiplied and drew near her, penetrating,\nher. It all disappeared; she recognised the lights of the houses that shone through the fog.\nNow her situation, like an abyss, rose up before her. She was panting as if her heart would burst. Then in\nan ecstasy of heroism, that made her almost joyous, she ran down the hill, crossed the cow-plank, the\nfoot-path, the alley, the market, and reached the chemist's shop. She was about to enter, but at the sound\nof the bell someone might come, and slipping in by the gate, holding her breath, feeling her way along the\nwalls, she went as far as the door of the kitchen, where a candle stuck on the stove was burning. Justin in\nhis shirt-sleeves was carrying out a dish.\n\"Ah! they are dining; I will wait.\"\nHe returned; she tapped at the window. He went out.\n\"The key! the one for upstairs where he keeps the--\"\n\"What?\"\nAnd he looked at her, astonished at the pallor of her face, that stood out white against the black\nbackground of the night. She seemed to him extraordinarily beautiful and majestic as a phantom. Without\nunderstanding what she wanted, he had the presentiment of something terrible.\nBut she went on quickly in a love voice; in a sweet, melting voice, \"I want it; give it to me.\"\nAs the partition wall was thin, they could hear the clatter of the forks on the plates in the dining-room.\nShe pretended that she wanted to kill the rats that kept her from sleeping.\n\"I must tell master.\"\n\"No, stay!\" Then with an indifferent air, \"Oh, it's not worth while; I'll tell him presently. Come, light me\nupstairs.\"\nShe entered the corridor into which the laboratory door opened. Against the wall was a key labelled\nCapharnaum.\n\"Justin!\" called the druggist impatiently.\n\"Let us go up.\"\nAnd he followed her. The key turned in the lock, and she went straight to the third shelf, so well did her\n-182\n\nmemory guide her, seized the blue jar, tore out the cork, plunged in her hand, and withdrawing it full of a\nwhite powder, she began eating it.\n\"Stop!\" he cried, rushing at her.\n\"Hush! someone will come.\"\nHe was in despair, was calling out.\n\"Say nothing, or all the blame will fall on your master.\"\nThen she went home, suddenly calmed, and with something of the serenity of one that had performed a\nduty.\nWhen Charles, distracted by the news of the distraint, returned home, Emma had just gone out. He cried\naloud, wept, fainted, but she did not return. Where could she be? He sent Felicite to Homais, to Monsieur\nTuvache, to Lheureux, to the \"Lion d'Or,\" everywhere, and in the intervals of his agony he saw his\nreputation destroyed, their fortune lost, Berthe's future ruined. By what?--Not a word! He waited till six\nin the evening. At last, unable to bear it any longer, and fancying she had gone to Rouen, he set out along\nthe highroad, walked a mile, met no one, again waited, and returned home. She had come back.\n\"What was the matter? Why? Explain to me.\"\nShe sat down at her writing-table and wrote a letter, which she sealed slowly, adding the date and the\nhour. Then she said in a solemn tone:\n\"You are to read it to-morrow; till then, I pray you, do not ask me a single question. No, not one!\"\n\"But--\"\n\"Oh, leave me!\"\nShe lay down full length on her bed. A bitter taste that she felt in her mouth awakened her. She saw\nCharles, and again closed her eyes.\nShe was studying herself curiously, to see if she were not suffering. But no! nothing as yet. She heard the\nticking of the clock, the crackling of the fire, and Charles breathing as he stood upright by her bed.\n\"Ahl it is but a little thing, death!\" she thought. \"I shall fall asleep and all will be over.\"\nShe drank a mouthful of water and turned to the wall. The frightful taste of ink continued.\n\"I am thirsty; oh! so thirsty,\" she sighed.\n\"What is it?\" said Charles, who was handing her a glass.\n\"It is nothing! Open the window; I am choking.\"\nShe was seized with a sickness so sudden that she had hardly time to draw out her handkerchief from\nunder the pillow.\n-183\n\n\"Take it away,\" she said quickly; \"throw it away.\"\nHe spoke to her; she did not answer. She lay motionless, afraid that the slightest movement might make\nher vomit. But she felt an icy cold creeping from her feet to her heart.\n\"Ah! it is beginning,\" she murmured.\n\"What did you say?\"\nShe turned her head from side to side with a gentle movement full of agony, while constantly opening her\nmouth as if something very heavy were weighing upon her tongue. At eight o'clock the vomiting began\nagain.\nCharles noticed that at the bottom of the basin there was a sort of white sediment sticking to the sides of\nthe porcelain.\n\"This is extraordinary--very singular,\" he repeated.\nBut she said in a firm voice, \"No, you are mistaken.\"\nThen gently, and almost as caressing her, he passed his hand over her stomach. She uttered a sharp cry.\nHe fell back terror-stricken.\nThen she began to groan, faintly at first. Her shoulders were shaken by a strong shuddering, and she was\ngrowing paler than the sheets in which her clenched fingers buried themselves. Her unequal pulse was\nnow almost imperceptible.\nDrops of sweat oozed from her bluish face, that seemed as if rigid in the exhalations of a metallic vapour.\nHer teeth chattered, her dilated eyes looked vaguely about her, and to all questions she replied only with a\nshake of the head; she even smiled once or twice. Gradually, her moaning grew louder; a hollow shriek\nburst from her; she pretended she was better and that she would get up presently. But she was seized with\nconvulsions and cried out--\n\"Ah! my God! It is horrible!\"\nHe threw himself on his knees by her bed.\n\"Tell me! what have you eaten? Answer, for heaven's sake!\"\nAnd he looked at her with a tenderness in his eyes such as she had never seen.\n\"Well, there--there!\" she said in a faint voice. He flew to the writing-table, tore open the seal, and read\naloud: \"Accuse no one.\" He stopped, passed his hands across his eyes, and read it over again.\n\"What! help--help!\"\nHe could only keep repeating the word: \"Poisoned! poisoned!\" Felicite ran to Homais, who proclaimed it\nin the market-place; Madame Lefrancois heard it at the \"Lion d'Or\"; some got up to go and tell their\nneighbours, and all night the village was on the alert.\nDistraught, faltering, reeling, Charles wandered about the room. He knocked against the furniture, tore his\n-184\n\nhair, and the chemist had never believed that there could be so terrible a sight.\nHe went home to write to Monsieur Canivet and to Doctor Lariviere. He lost his head, and made more\nthan fifteen rough copies. Hippolyte went to Neufchatel, and Justin so spurred Bovary's horse that he left\nit foundered and three parts dead by the hill at Bois-Guillaume.\nCharles tried to look up his medical dictionary, but could not read it; the lines were dancing.\n\"Be calm,\" said the druggist; \"we have only to administer a powerful antidote. What is the poison?\"\nCharles showed him the letter. It was arsenic.\n\"Very well,\" said Homais, \"we must make an analysis.\"\nFor he knew that in cases of poisoning an analysis must be made; and the other, who did not understand,\nanswered--\n\"Oh, do anything! save her!\"\nThen going back to her, he sank upon the carpet, and lay there with his head leaning against the edge of\nher bed, sobbing.\n\"Don't cry,\" she said to him. \"Soon I shall not trouble you any more.\"\n\"Why was it? Who drove you to it?\"\nShe replied. \"It had to be, my dear!\"\n\"Weren't you happy? Is it my fault? I did all I could!\"\n\"Yes, that is true--you are good--you.\"\nAnd she passed her hand slowly over his hair. The sweetness of this sensation deepened his sadness; he\nfelt his whole being dissolving in despair at the thought that he must lose her, just when she was\nconfessing more love for him than ever. And he could think of nothing; he did not know, he did not dare;\nthe urgent need for some immediate resolution gave the finishing stroke to the turmoil of his mind.\nSo she had done, she thought, with all the treachery; and meanness, and numberless desires that had\ntortured her. She hated no one now; a twilight dimness was settling upon her thoughts, and, of all earthly\nnoises, Emma heard none but the intermittent lamentations of this poor heart, sweet and indistinct like the\necho of a symphony dying away.\n\"Bring me the child,\" she said, raising herself on her elbow.\n\"You are not worse, are you?\" asked Charles.\n\"No, no!\"\nThe child, serious, and still half-asleep, was carried in on the servant's arm in her long white nightgown,\nfrom which her bare feet peeped out. She looked wonderingly at the disordered room, and half-closed her\neyes, dazzled by the candles burning on the table. They reminded her, no doubt, of the morning of New\n-185\n\nYear's day and Mid-Lent, when thus awakened early by candle-light she came to her mother's bed to\nfetch her presents, for she began saying--\n\"But where is it, mamma?\" And as everybody was silent, \"But I can't see my little stocking.\"\nFelicite held her over the bed while she still kept looking towards the mantelpiece.\n\"Has nurse taken it?\" she asked.\nAnd at this name, that carried her back to the memory of her adulteries and her calamities, Madame\nBovary turned away her head, as at the loathing of another bitterer poison that rose to her mouth. But\nBerthe remained perched on the bed.\n\"Oh, how big your eyes are, mamma! How pale you are! how hot you are!\"\nHer mother looked at her. \"I am frightened!\" cried the child, recoiling.\nEmma took her hand to kiss it; the child struggled.\n\"That will do. Take her away,\" cried Charles, who was sobbing in the alcove.\nThen the symptoms ceased for a moment; she seemed less agitated; and at every insignificant word, at\nevery respiration a little more easy, he regained hope. At last, when Canivet came in, he threw himself\ninto his arms.\n\"Ah! it is you. Thanks! You are good! But she is better. See! look at her.\"\nHis colleague was by no means of this opinion, and, as he said of himself, \"never beating about the bush,\"\nhe prescribed, an emetic in order to empty the stomach completely.\nShe soon began vomiting blood. Her lips became drawn. Her limbs were convulsed, her whole body\ncovered with brown spots, and her pulse slipped beneath the fingers like a stretched thread, like a\nharp-string nearly breaking.\nAfter this she began to scream horribly. She cursed the poison, railed at it, and implored it to be quick,\nand thrust away with her stiffened arms everything that Charles, in more agony than herself, tried to make\nher drink. He stood up, his handkerchief to his lips, with a rattling sound in his throat, weeping, and\nchoked by sobs that shook his whole body. Felicite was running hither and thither in the room. Homais,\nmotionless, uttered great sighs; and Monsieur Canivet, always retaining his self-command, nevertheless\nbegan to feel uneasy.\n\"The devil! yet she has been purged, and from the moment that the cause ceases--\"\n\"The effect must cease,\" said Homais, \"that is evident.\"\n\"Oh, save her!\" cried Bovary.\nAnd, without listening to the chemist, who was still venturing the hypothesis, \"It is perhaps a salutary\nparoxysm,\" Canivet was about to administer some theriac, when they heard the cracking of a whip; all the\nwindows rattled, and a post-chaise drawn by three horses abreast, up to their ears in mud, drove at a\ngallop round the corner of the market. It was Doctor Lariviere.\n-186\n\nThe apparition of a god would not have caused more commotion. Bovary raised his hands; Canivet\nstopped short; and Homais pulled off his skull-cap long before the doctor had come in.\nHe belonged to that great school of surgery begotten of Bichat, to that generation, now extinct, of\nphilosophical practitioners, who, loving their art with a fanatical love, exercised it with enthusiasm and\nwisdom. Everyone in his hospital trembled when he was angry; and his students so revered him that they\ntried, as soon as they were themselves in practice, to imitate him as much as possible. So that in all the\ntowns about they were found wearing his long wadded merino overcoat and black frock-coat, whose\nbuttoned cuffs slightly covered his brawny hands--very beautiful hands, and that never knew gloves, as\nthough to be more ready to plunge into suffering. Disdainful of honours, of titles, and of academies, like\none of the old Knight-Hospitallers, generous, fatherly to the poor, and practising virtue without believing\nin it, he would almost have passed for a saint if the keenness of his intellect had not caused him to be\nfeared as a demon. His glance, more penetrating than his bistouries, looked straight into your soul, and\ndissected every lie athwart all assertions and all reticences. And thus he went along, full of that debonair\nmajesty that is given by the consciousness of great talent, of fortune, and of forty years of a labourious\nand irreproachable life.\nHe frowned as soon as he had passed the door when he saw the cadaverous face of Emma stretched out on\nher back with her mouth open. Then, while apparently listening to Canivet, he rubbed his fingers up and\ndown beneath his nostrils, and repeated--\n\"Good! good!\"\nBut he made a slow gesture with his shoulders. Bovary watched him; they looked at one another; and this\nman, accustomed as he was to the sight of pain, could not keep back a tear that fell on his shirt-frill.\nHe tried to take Canivet into the next room. Charles followed him.\n\"She is very ill, isn't she? If we put on sinapisms? Anything! Oh, think of something, you who have\nsaved so many!\"\nCharles caught him in both his arms, and gazed at him wildly, imploringly, half-fainting against his\nbreast.\n\"Come, my poor fellow, courage! There is nothing more to be done.\"\nAnd Doctor Lariviere turned away.\n\"You are going?\"\n\"I will come back.\"\nHe went out only to give an order to the coachman, with Monsieur Canivet, who did not care either to\nhave Emma die under his hands.\nThe chemist rejoined them on the Place. He could not by temperament keep away from celebrities, so he\nbegged Monsieur Lariviere to do him the signal honour of accepting some breakfast.\nHe sent quickly to the \"Lion d'Or\" for some pigeons; to the butcher's for all the cutlets that were to be\nhad; to Tuvache for cream; and to Lestiboudois for eggs; and the druggist himself aided in the\npreparations, while Madame Homais was saying as she pulled together the strings of her jacket--\n-187\n\n\"You must excuse us, sir, for in this poor place, when one hasn't been told the night before--\"\n\"Wine glasses!\" whispered Homais.\n\"If only we were in town, we could fall back upon stuffed trotters.\"\n\"Be quiet! Sit down, doctor!\"\nHe thought fit, after the first few mouthfuls, to give some details as to the catastrophe.\n\"We first had a feeling of siccity in the pharynx, then intolerable pains at the epigastrium, super\npurgation, coma.\"\n\"But how did she poison herself?\"\n\"I don't know, doctor, and I don't even know where she can have procured the arsenious acid.\"\nJustin, who was just bringing in a pile of plates, began to tremble.\n\"What's the matter?\" said the chemist.\nAt this question the young man dropped the whole lot on the ground with a crash.\n\"Imbecile!\" cried Homais. \"awkward lout! block-head! confounded ass!\"\nBut suddenly controlling himself--\n\"I wished, doctor, to make an analysis, and primo I delicately introduced a tube--\"\n\"You would have done better,\" said the physician, \"to introduce your fingers into her throat.\"\nHis colleague was silent, having just before privately received a severe lecture about his emetic, so that\nthis good Canivet, so arrogant and so verbose at the time of the clubfoot, was to-day very modest. He\nsmiled without ceasing in an approving manner.\nHomais dilated in Amphytrionic pride, and the affecting thought of Bovary vaguely contributed to his\npleasure by a kind of egotistic reflex upon himself. Then the presence of the doctor transported him. He\ndisplayed his erudition, cited pell-mell cantharides, upas, the manchineel, vipers.\n\"I have even read that various persons have found themselves under toxicological symptoms, and, as it\nwere, thunderstricken by black-pudding that had been subjected to a too vehement fumigation. At least,\nthis was stated in a very fine report drawn up by one of our pharmaceutical chiefs, one of our masters, the\nillustrious Cadet de Gassicourt!\"\nMadame Homais reappeared, carrying one of those shaky machines that are heated with spirits of wine;\nfor Homais liked to make his coffee at table, having, moreover, torrefied it, pulverised it, and mixed it\nhimself.\n\"Saccharum, doctor?\" said he, offering the sugar.\nThen he had all his children brought down, anxious to have the physician's opinion on their constitutions.\n-188\n\nAt last Monsieur Lariviere was about to leave, when Madame Homais asked for a consultation about her\nhusband. He was making his blood too thick by going to sleep every evening after dinner.\n\"Oh, it isn't his blood that's too thick,\" said the physician.\nAnd, smiling a little at his unnoticed joke, the doctor opened the door. But the chemist's shop was full of\npeople; he had the greatest difficulty in getting rid of Monsieur Tuvache, who feared his spouse would get\ninflammation of the lungs, because she was in the habit of spitting on the ashes; then of Monsieur Binet,\nwho sometimes experienced sudden attacks of great hunger; and of Madame Caron, who suffered from\ntinglings; of Lheureux, who had vertigo; of Lestiboudois, who had rheumatism; and of Madame\nLefrancois, who had heartburn. At last the three horses started; and it was the general opinion that he had\nnot shown himself at all obliging.\nPublic attention was distracted by the appearance of Monsieur Bournisien, who was going across the\nmarket with the holy oil.\nHomais, as was due to his principles, compared priests to ravens attracted by the odour of death. The sight\nof an ecclesiastic was personally disagreeable to him, for the cassock made him think of the shroud, and\nhe detested the one from some fear of the other.\nNevertheless, not shrinking from what he called his mission, he returned to Bovary's in company with\nCanivet whom Monsieur Lariviere, before leaving, had strongly urged to make this visit; and he would,\nbut for his wife's objections, have taken his two sons with him, in order to accustom them to great\noccasions; that this might be a lesson, an example, a solemn picture, that should remain in their heads\nlater on.\nThe room when they went in was full of mournful solemnity. On the work-table, covered over with a\nwhite cloth, there were five or six small balls of cotton in a silver dish, near a large crucifix between two\nlighted candles.\nEmma, her chin sunken upon her breast, had her eyes inordinately wide open, and her poor hands\nwandered over the sheets with that hideous and soft movement of the dying, that seems as if they wanted\nalready to cover themselves with the shroud. Pale as a statue and with eyes red as fire, Charles, not\nweeping, stood opposite her at the foot of the bed, while the priest, bending one knee, was muttering\nwords in a low voice.\nShe turned her face slowly, and seemed filled with joy on seeing suddenly the violet stole, no doubt\nfinding again, in the midst of a temporary lull in her pain, the lost voluptuousness of her first mystical\ntransports, with the visions of eternal beatitude that were beginning.\nThe priest rose to take the crucifix; then she stretched forward her neck as one who is athirst, and glueing\nher lips to the body of the Man-God, she pressed upon it with all her expiring strength the fullest kiss of\nlove that she had ever given. Then he recited the Misereatur and the Indulgentiam, dipped his right thumb\nin the oil, and began to give extreme unction. First upon the eyes, that had so coveted all worldly pomp;\nthen upon the nostrils, that had been greedy of the warm breeze and amorous odours; then upon the\nmouth, that had uttered lies, that had curled with pride and cried out in lewdness; then upon the hands that\nhad delighted in sensual touches; and finally upon the soles of the feet, so swift of yore, when she was\nrunning to satisfy her desires, and that would now walk no more.\nThe cure wiped his fingers, threw the bit of cotton dipped in oil into the fire, and came and sat down by\nthe dying woman, to tell her that she must now blend her sufferings with those of Jesus Christ and\n-189\n\nabandon herself to the divine mercy.\nFinishing his exhortations, he tried to place in her hand a blessed candle, symbol of the celestial glory\nwith which she was soon to be surrounded. Emma, too weak, could not close her fingers, and the taper,\nbut for Monsieur Bournisien would have fallen to the ground.\nHowever, she was not quite so pale, and her face had an expression of serenity as if the sacrament had\ncured her.\nThe priest did not fail to point this out; he even explained to Bovary that the Lord sometimes prolonged\nthe life of persons when he thought it meet for their salvation; and Charles remembered the day when, so\nnear death, she had received the communion. Perhaps there was no need to despair, he thought.\nIn fact, she looked around her slowly, as one awakening from a dream; then in a distinct voice she asked\nfor her looking-glass, and remained some time bending over it, until the big tears fell from her eyes. Then\nshe turned away her head with a sigh and fell back upon the pillows.\nHer chest soon began panting rapidly; the whole of her tongue protruded from her mouth; her eyes, as\nthey rolled, grew paler, like the two globes of a lamp that is going out, so that one might have thought her\nalready dead but for the fearful labouring of her ribs, shaken by violent breathing, as if the soul were\nstruggling to free itself. Felicite knelt down before the crucifix, and the druggist himself slightly bent his\nknees, while Monsieur Canivet looked out vaguely at the Place. Bournisien had again begun to pray, his\nface bowed against the edge of the bed, his long black cassock trailing behind him in the room. Charles\nwas on the other side, on his knees, his arms outstretched towards Emma. He had taken her hands and\npressed them, shuddering at every beat of her heart, as at the shaking of a falling ruin. As the death-rattle\nbecame stronger the priest prayed faster; his prayers mingled with the stifled sobs of Bovary, and\nsometimes all seemed lost in the muffled murmur of the Latin syllables that tolled like a passing bell.\nSuddenly on the pavement was heard a loud noise of clogs and the clattering of a stick; and a voice\nrose--a raucous voice--that sang--\n\"Maids an the warmth of a summer day Dream of love and of love always\"\nEmma raised herself like a galvanised corpse, her hair undone, her eyes fixed, staring.\n\"Where the sickle blades have been, Nannette, gathering ears of corn, Passes bending down, my queen,\nTo the earth where they were born.\"\n\"The blind man!\" she cried. And Emma began to laugh, an atrocious, frantic, despairing laugh, thinking\nshe saw the hideous face of the poor wretch that stood out against the eternal night like a menace.\n\"The wind is strong this summer day, Her petticoat has flown away.\"\nShe fell back upon the mattress in a convulsion. They all drew near. She was dead.\nChapter Nine\nThere is always after the death of anyone a kind of stupefaction; so difficult is it to grasp this advent of\nnothingness and to resign ourselves to believe in it. But still, when he saw that she did not move, Charles\nthrew himself upon her, crying--\n\"Farewell! farewell!\"\n-190\n\nHomais and Canivet dragged him from the room.\n\"Restrain yourself!\"\n\"Yes.\" said he, struggling, \"I'll be quiet. I'll not do anything. But leave me alone. I want to see her. She is\nmy wife!\"\nAnd he wept.\n\"Cry,\" said the chemist; \"let nature take her course; that will solace you.\"\nWeaker than a child, Charles let himself be led downstairs into the sitting-room, and Monsieur Homais\nsoon went home. On the Place he was accosted by the blind man, who, having dragged himself as far as\nYonville, in the hope of getting the antiphlogistic pomade, was asking every passer-by where the druggist\nlived.\n\"There now! as if I hadn't got other fish to fry. Well, so much the worse; you must come later on.\"\nAnd he entered the shop hurriedly.\nHe had to write two letters, to prepare a soothing potion for Bovary, to invent some lie that would conceal\nthe poisoning, and work it up into an article for the \"Fanal,\" without counting the people who were\nwaiting to get the news from him; and when the Yonvillers had all heard his story of the arsenic that she\nhad mistaken for sugar in making a vanilla cream. Homais once more returned to Bovary's.\nHe found him alone (Monsieur Canivet had left), sitting in an arm-chair near the window, staring with an\nidiotic look at the flags of the floor.\n\"Now,\" said the chemist, \"you ought yourself to fix the hour for the ceremony.\"\n\"Why? What ceremony?\" Then, in a stammering, frightened voice, \"Oh, no! not that. No! I want to see\nher here.\"\nHomais, to keep himself in countenance, took up a water-bottle on the whatnot to water the geraniums.\n\"Ah! thanks,\" said Charles; \"you are good.\"\nBut he did not finish, choking beneath the crowd of memories that this action of the druggist recalled to\nhim.\nThen to distract him, Homais thought fit to talk a little horticulture: plants wanted humidity. Charles\nbowed his head in sign of approbation.\n\"Besides, the fine days will soon be here again.\"\n\"Ah!\" said Bovary.\nThe druggist, at his wit's end, began softly to draw aside the small window-curtain.\n\"Hallo! there's Monsieur Tuvache passing.\"\n-191\n\nCharles repeated like a machine--\n\"Monsieur Tuvache passing!\"\nHomais did not dare to speak to him again about the funeral arrangements; it was the priest who\nsucceeded in reconciling him to them.\nHe shut himself up in his consulting-room, took a pen, and after sobbing for some time, wrote--\n\"I wish her to be buried in her wedding-dress, with white shoes, and a wreath. Her hair is to be spread out\nover her shoulders. Three coffins, one of oak, one of mahogany, one of lead. Let no one say anything to\nme. I shall have strength. Over all there is to be placed a large piece of green velvet. This is my wish; see\nthat it is done.\"\nThe two men were much surprised at Bovary's romantic ideas. The chemist at once went to him and\nsaid--\n\"This velvet seems to me a superfetation. Besides, the expense--\"\n\"What's that to you?\" cried Charles. \"Leave me! You did not love her. Go!\"\nThe priest took him by the arm for a turn in the garden. He discoursed on the vanity of earthly things.\nGod was very great, was very good: one must submit to his decrees without a murmur; nay, must even\nthank him.\nCharles burst out into blasphemies: \"I hate your God!\"\n\"The spirit of rebellion is still upon you,\" sighed the ecclesiastic.\nBovary was far away. He was walking with great strides along by the wall, near the espalier, and he\nground his teeth; he raised to heaven looks of malediction, but not so much as a leaf stirred.\nA fine rain was falling: Charles, whose chest was bare, at last began to shiver; he went in and sat down in\nthe kitchen.\nAt six o'clock a noise like a clatter of old iron was heard on the Place; it was the \"Hirondelle\" coming in,\nand he remained with his forehead against the windowpane, watching all the passengers get out, one after\nthe other. Felicite put down a mattress for him in the drawing-room. He threw himself upon it and fell\nasleep.\nAlthough a philosopher, Monsieur Homais respected the dead. So bearing no grudge to poor Charles, he\ncame back again in the evening to sit up with the body; bringing with him three volumes and a\npocket-book for taking notes.\nMonsieur Bournisien was there, and two large candles were burning at the head of the bed, that had been\ntaken out of the alcove. The druggist, on whom the silence weighed, was not long before he began\nformulating some regrets about this \"unfortunate young woman.\" and the priest replied that there was\nnothing to do now but pray for her.\n\"Yet,\" Homais went on, \"one of two things; either she died in a state of grace (as the Church has it), and\nthen she has no need of our prayers; or else she departed impertinent (that is, I believe, the ecclesiastical\n-192\n\nexpression), and then--\"\nBournisien interrupted him, replying testily that it was none the less necessary to pray.\n\"But,\" objected the chemist, \"since God knows all our needs, what can be the good of prayer?\"\n\"What!\" cried the ecclesiastic, \"prayer! Why, aren't you a Christian?\"\n\"Excuse me,\" said Homais; \"I admire Christianity. To begin with, it enfranchised the slaves, introduced\ninto the world a morality--\"\n\"That isn't the question. All the texts-\"\n\"Oh! oh! As to texts, look at history; it, is known that all the texts have been falsified by the Jesuits.\"\nCharles came in, and advancing towards the bed, slowly drew the curtains.\nEmma's head was turned towards her right shoulder, the corner of her mouth, which was open, seemed\nlike a black hole at the lower part of her face; her two thumbs were bent into the palms of her hands; a\nkind of white dust besprinkled her lashes, and her eyes were beginning to disappear in that viscous pallor\nthat looks like a thin web, as if spiders had spun it over. The sheet sunk in from her breast to her knees,\nand then rose at the tips of her toes, and it seemed to Charles that infinite masses, an enormous load, were\nweighing upon her.\nThe church clock struck two. They could hear the loud murmur of the river flowing in the darkness at the\nfoot of the terrace. Monsieur Bournisien from time to time blew his nose noisily, and Homais' pen was\nscratching over the paper.\n\"Come, my good friend,\" he said, \"withdraw; this spectacle is tearing you to pieces.\"\nCharles once gone, the chemist and the cure recommenced their discussions.\n\"Read Voltaire,\" said the one, \"read D'Holbach, read the 'Encyclopaedia'!\"\n\"Read the 'Letters of some Portuguese Jews,'\" said the other; \"read 'The Meaning of Christianity,' by\nNicolas, formerly a magistrate.\"\nThey grew warm, they grew red, they both talked at once without listening to each other. Bournisien was\nscandalized at such audacity; Homais marvelled at such stupidity; and they were on the point of insulting\none another when Charles suddenly reappeared. A fascination drew him. He was continually coming\nupstairs.\nHe stood opposite her, the better to see her, and he lost himself in a contemplation so deep that it was no\nlonger painful.\nHe recalled stories of catalepsy, the marvels of magnetism, and he said to himself that by willing it with\nall his force he might perhaps succeed in reviving her. Once he even bent towards he, and cried in a low\nvoice, \"Emma! Emma!\" His strong breathing made the flames of the candles tremble against the wall.\nAt daybreak Madame Bovary senior arrived. Charles as he embraced her burst into another flood of tears.\nShe tried, as the chemist had done, to make some remarks to him on the expenses of the funeral. He\n-193\n\nbecame so angry that she was silent, and he even commissioned her to go to town at once and buy what\nwas necessary.\nCharles remained alone the whole afternoon; they had taken Berthe to Madame Homais'; Felicite was in\nthe room upstairs with Madame Lefrancois.\nIn the evening he had some visitors. He rose, pressed their hands, unable to speak. Then they sat down\nnear one another, and formed a large semicircle in front of the fire. With lowered faces, and swinging one\nleg crossed over the other knee, they uttered deep sighs at intervals; each one was inordinately bored, and\nyet none would be the first to go.\nHomais, when he returned at nine o'clock (for the last two days only Homais seemed to have been on the\nPlace), was laden with a stock of camphor, of benzine, and aromatic herbs. He also carried a large jar full\nof chlorine water, to keep off all miasmata. Just then the servant, Madame Lefrancois, and Madame\nBovary senior were busy about Emma, finishing dressing her, and they were drawing down the long stiff\nveil that covered her to her satin shoes.\nFelicite was sobbing--\"Ah! my poor mistress! my poor mistress!\"\n\"Look at her,\" said the landlady, sighing; \"how pretty she still is! Now, couldn't you swear she was going\nto get up in a minute?\"\nThen they bent over her to put on her wreath. They had to raise the head a little, and a rush of black liquid\nissued, as if she were vomiting, from her mouth.\n\"Oh, goodness! The dress; take care!\" cried Madame Lefrancois. \"Now, just come and help,\" she said to\nthe chemist. \"Perhaps you're afraid?\"\n\"I afraid?\" replied he, shrugging his shoulders. \"I dare say! I've seen all sorts of things at the hospital\nwhen I was studying pharmacy. We used to make punch in the dissecting room! Nothingness does not\nterrify a philosopher; and, as I often say, I even intend to leave my body to the hospitals, in order, later\non, to serve science.\"\nThe cure on his arrival inquired how Monsieur Bovary was, and, on the reply of the druggist, went\non--\"The blow, you see, is still too recent.\"\nThen Homais congratulated him on not being exposed, like other people, to the loss of a beloved\ncompanion; whence there followed a discussion on the celibacy of priests.\n\"For,\" said the chemist, \"it is unnatural that a man should do without women! There have been crimes--\"\n\"But, good heaven!\" cried the ecclesiastic, \"how do you expect an individual who is married to keep the\nsecrets of the confessional, for example?\"\nHomais fell foul of the confessional. Bournisien defended it; he enlarged on the acts of restitution that it\nbrought about. He cited various anecdotes about thieves who had suddenly become honest. Military men\non approaching the tribunal of penitence had felt the scales fall from their eyes. At Fribourg there was a\nminister--\nHis companion was asleep. Then he felt somewhat stifled by the over-heavy atmosphere of the room; he\nopened the window; this awoke the chemist.\n-194\n\n\"Come, take a pinch of snuff,\" he said to him. \"Take it; it'll relieve you.\"\nA continual barking was heard in the distance. \"Do you hear that dog howling?\" said the chemist.\n\"They smell the dead,\" replied the priest. \"It's like bees; they leave their hives on the decease of any\nperson.\"\nHomais made no remark upon these prejudices, for he had again dropped asleep. Monsieur Bournisien,\nstronger than he, went on moving his lips gently for some time, then insensibly his chin sank down, he let\nfall his big black boot, and began to snore.\nThey sat opposite one another, with protruding stomachs, puffed-up faces, and frowning looks, after so\nmuch disagreement uniting at last in the same human weakness, and they moved no more than the corpse\nby their side, that seemed to be sleeping.\nCharles coming in did not wake them. It was the last time; he came to bid her farewell.\nThe aromatic herbs were still smoking, and spirals of bluish vapour blended at the window-sash with the\nfog that was coming in. There were few stars, and the night was warm. The wax of the candles fell in\ngreat drops upon the sheets of the bed. Charles watched them burn, tiring his eyes against the glare of\ntheir yellow flame.\nThe watering on the satin gown shimmered white as moonlight. Emma was lost beneath it; and it seemed\nto him that, spreading beyond her own self, she blended confusedly with everything around her-- the\nsilence, the night, the passing wind, the damp odours rising from the ground.\nThen suddenly he saw her in the garden at Tostes, on a bench against the thorn hedge, or else at Rouen in\nthe streets, on the threshold of their house, in the yard at Bertaux. He again heard the laughter of the\nhappy boys beneath the apple-trees: the room was filled with the perfume of her hair; and her dress\nrustled in his arms with a noise like electricity. The dress was still the same.\nFor a long while he thus recalled all his lost joys, her attitudes, her movements, the sound of her voice.\nUpon one fit of despair followed another, and even others, inexhaustible as the waves of an overflowing\nsea.\nA terrible curiosity seized him. Slowly, with the tips of his fingers, palpitating, he lifted her veil. But he\nuttered a cry of horror that awoke the other two.\nThey dragged him down into the sitting-room. Then Felicite came up to say that he wanted some of her\nhair.\n\"Cut some off,\" replied the druggist.\nAnd as she did not dare to, he himself stepped forward, scissors in hand. He trembled so that he pierced\nthe skin of the temple in several places. At last, stiffening himself against emotion, Homais gave two or\nthree great cuts at random that left white patches amongst that beautiful black hair.\nThe chemist and the cure plunged anew into their occupations, not without sleeping from time to time, of\nwhich they accused each other reciprocally at each fresh awakening. Then Monsieur Bournisien sprinkled\nthe room with holy water and Homais threw a little chlorine water on the floor.\n-195\n\nFelicite had taken care to put on the chest of drawers, for each of them, a bottle of brandy, some cheese,\nand a large roll. And the druggist, who could not hold out any longer, about four in the morning sighed--\n\"My word! I should like to take some sustenance.\"\nThe priest did not need any persuading; he went out to go and say mass, came back, and then they ate and\nhobnobbed, giggling a little without knowing why, stimulated by that vague gaiety that comes upon us\nafter times of sadness, and at the last glass the priest said to the druggist, as he clapped him on the\nshoulder--\n\"We shall end by understanding one another.\"\nIn the passage downstairs they met the undertaker's men, who were coming in. Then Charles for two\nhours had to suffer the torture of hearing the hammer resound against the wood. Next day they lowered\nher into her oak coffin, that was fitted into the other two; but as the bier was too large, they had to fill up\nthe gaps with the wool of a mattress. At last, when the three lids had been planed down, nailed, soldered,\nit was placed outside in front of the door; the house was thrown open, and the people of Yonville began to\nflock round.\nOld Rouault arrived, and fainted on the Place when he saw the black cloth!\nChapter Ten\nHe had only received the chemist's letter thirty-six hours after the event; and, from consideration for his\nfeelings, Homais had so worded it that it was impossible to make out what it was all about.\nFirst, the old fellow had fallen as if struck by apoplexy. Next, he understood that she was not dead, but\nshe might be. At last, he had put on his blouse, taken his hat, fastened his spurs to his boots, and set out at\nfull speed; and the whole of the way old Rouault, panting, was torn by anguish. Once even he was obliged\nto dismount. He was dizzy; he heard voices round about him; he felt himself going mad.\nDay broke. He saw three black hens asleep in a tree. He shuddered, horrified at this omen. Then he\npromised the Holy Virgin three chasubles for the church, and that he would go barefooted from the\ncemetery at Bertaux to the chapel of Vassonville.\nHe entered Maromme shouting for the people of the inn, burst open the door with a thrust of his shoulder,\nmade for a sack of oats, emptied a bottle of sweet cider into the manger, and again mounted his nag,\nwhose feet struck fire as it dashed along.\nHe said to himself that no doubt they would save her; the doctors would discover some remedy surely. He\nremembered all the miraculous cures he had been told about. Then she appeared to him dead. She was\nthere; before his eyes, lying on her back in the middle of the road. He reined up, and the hallucination\ndisappeared.\nAt Quincampoix, to give himself heart, he drank three cups of coffee one after the other. He fancied they\nhad made a mistake in the name in writing. He looked for the letter in his pocket, felt it there, but did not\ndare to open it.\nAt last he began to think it was all a joke; someone's spite, the jest of some wag; and besides, if she were\ndead, one would have known it. But no! There was nothing extraordinary about the country; the sky was\nblue, the trees swayed; a flock of sheep passed. He saw the village; he was seen coming bending forward\nupon his horse, belabouring it with great blows, the girths dripping with blood.\n-196\n\nWhen he had recovered consciousness, he fell, weeping, into Bovary's arms: \"My girl! Emma! my child!\ntell me--\"\nThe other replied, sobbing, \"I don't know! I don't know! It's a curse!\"\nThe druggist separated them. \"These horrible details are useless. I will tell this gentleman all about it.\nHere are the people coming. Dignity! Come now! Philosophy!\"\nThe poor fellow tried to show himself brave, and repeated several times. \"Yes! courage!\"\n\"Oh,\" cried the old man, \"so I will have, by God! I'll go along o' her to the end!\"\nThe bell began tolling. All was ready; they had to start. And seated in a stall of the choir, side by side,\nthey saw pass and repass in front of them continually the three chanting choristers.\nThe serpent-player was blowing with all his might. Monsieur Bournisien, in full vestments, was singing\nin a shrill voice. He bowed before the tabernacle, raising his hands, stretched out his arms. Lestiboudois\nwent about the church with his whalebone stick. The bier stood near the lectern, between four rows of\ncandles. Charles felt inclined to get up and put them out.\nYet he tried to stir himself to a feeling of devotion, to throw himself into the hope of a future life in which\nhe should see her again. He imagined to himself she had gone on a long journey, far away, for along time.\nBut when he thought of her lying there, and that all was over, that they would lay her in the earth, he was\nseized with a fierce, gloomy, despairful rage. At times he thought he felt nothing more, and he enjoyed\nthis lull in his pain, whilst at the same time he reproached himself for being a wretch.\nThe sharp noise of an iron-ferruled stick was heard on the stones, striking them at irregular intervals. It\ncame from the end of the church, and stopped short at the lower aisles. A man in a coarse brown jacket\nknelt down painfully. It was Hippolyte, the stable-boy at the \"Lion d'Or.\" He had put on his new leg.\nOne of the choristers went round the nave making a collection, and the coppers chinked one after the\nother on the silver plate.\n\"Oh, make haste! I am in pain!\" cried Bovary, angrily throwing him a five-franc piece. The churchman\nthanked him with a deep bow.\nThey sang, they knelt, they stood up; it was endless! He remembered that once, in the early times, they\nhad been to mass together, and they had sat down on the other side, on the right, by the wall. The bell\nbegan again. There was a great moving of chairs; the bearers slipped their three staves under the coffin,\nand everyone left the church.\nThen Justin appeared at the door of the shop. He suddenly went in again, pale, staggering.\nPeople were at the windows to see the procession pass. Charles at the head walked erect. He affected a\nbrave air, and saluted with a nod those who, coming out from the lanes or from their doors, stood amidst\nthe crowd.\nThe six men, three on either side, walked slowly, panting a little. The priests, the choristers, and the two\nchoirboys recited the De profundis[22], and their voices echoed over the fields, rising and falling with\ntheir undulations. Sometimes they disappeared in the windings of the path; but the great silver cross rose\nalways before the trees.\n-197\n\n[22]Psalm CXXX.\nThe women followed in black cloaks with turned-down hoods; each of them carried in her hands a large\nlighted candle, and Charles felt himself growing weaker at this continual repetition of prayers and torches,\nbeneath this oppressive odour of wax and of cassocks. A fresh breeze was blowing; the rye and colza\nwere sprouting, little dewdrops trembled at the roadsides and on the hawthorn hedges. All sorts of joyous\nsounds filled the air; the jolting of a cart rolling afar off in the ruts, the crowing of a cock, repeated again\nand again, or the gambling of a foal running away under the apple-trees: The pure sky was fretted with\nrosy clouds; a bluish haze rested upon the cots covered with iris. Charles as he passed recognised each\ncourtyard. He remembered mornings like this, when, after visiting some patient, he came out from one\nand returned to her.\nThe black cloth bestrewn with white beads blew up from time to time, laying bare the coffin. The tired\nbearers walked more slowly, and it advanced with constant jerks, like a boat that pitches with every wave.\nThey reached the cemetery. The men went right down to a place in the grass where a grave was dug. They\nranged themselves all round; and while the priest spoke, the red soil thrown up at the sides kept\nnoiselessly slipping down at the corners.\nThen when the four ropes were arranged the coffin was placed upon them. He watched it descend; it\nseemed descending for ever. At last a thud was heard; the ropes creaked as they were drawn up. Then\nBournisien took the spade handed to him by Lestiboudois; with his left hand all the time sprinkling water,\nwith the right he vigorously threw in a large spadeful; and the wood of the coffin, struck by the pebbles,\ngave forth that dread sound that seems to us the reverberation of eternity.\nThe ecclesiastic passed the holy water sprinkler to his neighbour. This was Homais. He swung it gravely,\nthen handed it to Charles, who sank to his knees in the earth and threw in handfuls of it, crying, \"Adieu!\"\nHe sent her kisses; he dragged himself towards the grave, to engulf himself with her. They led him away,\nand he soon grew calmer, feeling perhaps, like the others, a vague satisfaction that it was all over.\nOld Rouault on his way back began quietly smoking a pipe, which Homais in his innermost conscience\nthought not quite the thing. He also noticed that Monsieur Binet had not been present, and that Tuvache\nhad \"made off\" after mass, and that Theodore, the notary's servant wore a blue coat, \"as if one could not\nhave got a black coat, since that is the custom, by Jove!\" And to share his observations with others he\nwent from group to group. They were deploring Emma's death, especially Lheureux, who had not failed\nto come to the funeral.\n\"Poor little woman! What a trouble for her husband!\"\nThe druggist continued, \"Do you know that but for me he would have committed some fatal attempt upon\nhimself?\"\n\"Such a good woman! To think that I saw her only last Saturday in my shop.\"\n\"I haven't had leisure,\" said Homais, \"to prepare a few words that I would have cast upon her tomb.\"\nCharles on getting home undressed, and old Rouault put on his blue blouse. It was a new one, and as he\nhad often during the journey wiped his eyes on the sleeves, the dye had stained his face, and the traces of\ntears made lines in the layer of dust that covered it.\nMadame Bovary senior was with them. All three were silent. At last the old fellow sighed--\n-198\n\n\"Do you remember, my friend, that I went to Tostes once when you had just lost your first deceased? I\nconsoled you at that time. I thought of something to say then, but now--\" Then, with a loud groan that\nshook his whole chest, \"Ah! this is the end for me, do you see! I saw my wife go, then my son, and now\nto-day it's my daughter.\"\nHe wanted to go back at once to Bertaux, saying that he could not sleep in this house. He even refused to\nsee his granddaughter.\n\"No, no! It would grieve me too much. Only you'll kiss her many times for me. Good-bye! you're a good\nfellow! And then I shall never forget that,\" he said, slapping his thigh. \"Never fear, you shall always have\nyour turkey.\"\nBut when he reached the top of the hill he turned back, as he had turned once before on the road of\nSaint-Victor when he had parted from her. The windows of the village were all on fire beneath the\nslanting rays of the sun sinking behind the field. He put his hand over his eyes, and saw in the horizon an\nenclosure of walls, where trees here and there formed black clusters between white stones; then he went\non his way at a gentle trot, for his nag had gone lame.\nDespite their fatigue, Charles and his mother stayed very long that evening talking together. They spoke\nof the days of the past and of the future. She would come to live at Yonville; she would keep house for\nhim; they would never part again. She was ingenious and caressing, rejoicing in her heart at gaining once\nmore an affection that had wandered from her for so many years. Midnight struck. The village as usual\nwas silent, and Charles, awake, thought always of her.\nRodolphe, who, to distract himself, had been rambling about the wood all day, was sleeping quietly in his\nchateau, and Leon, down yonder, always slept.\nThere was another who at that hour was not asleep.\nOn the grave between the pine-trees a child was on his knees weeping, and his heart, rent by sobs, was\nbeating in the shadow beneath the load of an immense regret, sweeter than the moon and fathomless as\nthe night. The gate suddenly grated. It was Lestiboudois; he came to fetch his spade, that he had\nforgotten. He recognised Justin climbing over the wall, and at last knew who was the culprit who stole his\npotatoes.\nChapter Eleven\nThe next day Charles had the child brought back. She asked for her mamma. They told her she was away;\nthat she would bring her back some playthings. Berthe spoke of her again several times, then at last\nthought no more of her. The child's gaiety broke Bovary's heart, and he had to bear besides the\nintolerable consolations of the chemist.\nMoney troubles soon began again, Monsieur Lheureux urging on anew his friend Vincart, and Charles\npledged himself for exorbitant sums; for he would never consent to let the smallest of the things that had\nbelonged to HER be sold. His mother was exasperated with him; he grew even more angry than she did.\nHe had altogether changed. She left the house.\nThen everyone began \"taking advantage\" of him. Mademoiselle Lempereur presented a bill for six\nmonths' teaching, although Emma had never taken a lesson (despite the receipted bill she had shown\nBovary); it was an arrangement between the two women. The man at the circulating library demanded\nthree years' subscriptions; Mere Rollet claimed the postage due for some twenty letters, and when Charles\nasked for an explanation, she had the delicacy to reply--\n-199\n\n\"Oh, I don't know. It was for her business affairs.\"\nWith every debt he paid Charles thought he had come to the end of them. But others followed ceaselessly.\nHe sent in accounts for professional attendance. He was shown the letters his wife had written. Then he\nhad to apologise.\nFelicite now wore Madame Bovary's gowns; not all, for he had kept some of them, and he went to look at\nthem in her dressing-room, locking himself up there; she was about her height, and often Charles, seeing\nher from behind, was seized with an illusion, and cried out--\n\"Oh, stay, stay!\"\nBut at Whitsuntide she ran away from Yonville, carried off by Theodore, stealing all that was left of the\nwardrobe.\nIt was about this time that the widow Dupuis had the honour to inform him of the \"marriage of Monsieur\nLeon Dupuis her son, notary at Yvetot, to Mademoiselle Leocadie Leboeuf of Bondeville.\" Charles,\namong the other congratulations he sent him, wrote this sentence--\n\"How glad my poor wife would have been!\"\nOne day when, wandering aimlessly about the house, he had gone up to the attic, he felt a pellet of fine\npaper under his slipper. He opened it and read: \"Courage, Emma, courage. I would not bring misery into\nyour life.\" It was Rodolphe's letter, fallen to the ground between the boxes, where it had remained, and\nthat the wind from the dormer window had just blown towards the door. And Charles stood, motionless\nand staring, in the very same place where, long ago, Emma, in despair, and paler even than he, had\nthought of dying. At last he discovered a small R at the bottom of the second page. What did this mean?\nHe remembered Rodolphe's attentions, his sudden, disappearance, his constrained air when they had met\ntwo or three times since. But the respectful tone of the letter deceived him.\n\"Perhaps they loved one another platonically,\" he said to himself.\nBesides, Charles was not of those who go to the bottom of things; he shrank from the proofs, and his\nvague jealousy was lost in the immensity of his woe.\nEveryone, he thought, must have adored her; all men assuredly must have coveted her. She seemed but\nthe more beautiful to him for this; he was seized with a lasting, furious desire for her, that inflamed his\ndespair, and that was boundless, because it was now unrealisable.\nTo please her, as if she were still living, he adopted her predilections, her ideas; he bought patent leather\nboots and took to wearing white cravats. He put cosmetics on his moustache, and, like her, signed notes\nof hand. She corrupted him from beyond the grave.\nHe was obliged to sell his silver piece by piece; next he sold the drawing-room furniture. All the rooms\nwere stripped; but the bedroom, her own room, remained as before. After his dinner Charles went up\nthere. He pushed the round table in front of the fire, and drew up her armchair. He sat down opposite it. A\ncandle burnt in one of the gilt candlesticks. Berthe by his side was painting prints.\nHe suffered, poor man, at seeing her so badly dressed, with laceless boots, and the arm-holes of her\npinafore torn down to the hips; for the charwoman took no care of her. But she was so sweet, so pretty,\nand her little head bent forward so gracefully, letting the dear fair hair fall over her rosy cheeks, that an\n-200\n\ninfinite joy came upon him, a happiness mingled with bitterness, like those ill-made wines that taste of\nresin. He mended her toys, made her puppets from cardboard, or sewed up half-torn dolls. Then, if his\neyes fell upon the workbox, a ribbon lying about, or even a pin left in a crack of the table, he began to\ndream, and looked so sad that she became as sad as he.\nNo one now came to see them, for Justin had run away to Rouen, where he was a grocer's assistant, and\nthe druggist's children saw less and less of the child, Monsieur Homais not caring, seeing the difference\nof their social position, to continue the intimacy.\nThe blind man, whom he had not been able to cure with the pomade, had gone back to the hill of\nBois-Guillaume, where he told the travellers of the vain attempt of the druggist, to such an extent, that\nHomais when he went to town hid himself behind the curtains of the \"Hirondelle\" to avoid meeting him.\nHe detested him, and wishing, in the interests of his own reputation, to get rid of him at all costs, he\ndirected against him a secret battery, that betrayed the depth of his intellect and the baseness of his vanity.\nThus, for six consecutive months, one could read in the \"Fanal de Rouen\" editorials such as these--\n\"All who bend their steps towards the fertile plains of Picardy have, no doubt, remarked, by the\nBois-Guillaume hill, a wretch suffering from a horrible facial wound. He importunes, persecutes one, and\nlevies a regular tax on all travellers. Are we still living in the monstrous times of the Middle Ages, when\nvagabonds were permitted to display in our public places leprosy and scrofulas they had brought back\nfrom the Crusades?\"\nOr--\n\"In spite of the laws against vagabondage, the approaches to our great towns continue to be infected by\nbands of beggars. Some are seen going about alone, and these are not, perhaps, the least dangerous. What\nare our ediles about?\"\nThen Homais invented anecdotes--\n\"Yesterday, by the Bois-Guillaume hill, a skittish horse--\" And then followed the story of an accident\ncaused by the presence of the blind man.\nHe managed so well that the fellow was locked up. But he was released. He began again, and Homais\nbegan again. It was a struggle. Homais won it, for his foe was condemned to life-long confinement in an\nasylum.\nThis success emboldened him, and henceforth there was no longer a dog run over, a barn burnt down, a\nwoman beaten in the parish, of which he did not immediately inform the public, guided always by the\nlove of progress and the hate of priests. He instituted comparisons between the elementary and clerical\nschools to the detriment of the latter; called to mind the massacre of St. Bartholomew a propos of a grant\nof one hundred francs to the church, and denounced abuses, aired new views. That was his phrase.\nHomais was digging and delving; he was becoming dangerous.\nHowever, he was stifling in the narrow limits of journalism, and soon a book, a work was necessary to\nhim. Then he composed \"General Statistics of the Canton of Yonville, followed by Climatological\nRemarks.\" The statistics drove him to philosophy. He busied himself with great questions: the social\nproblem: moralisation of the poorer classes, pisciculture, caoutchouc, railways, etc. He even began to\nblush at being a bourgeois. He affected the artistic style, he smoked. He bought two chic Pompadour\nstatuettes to adorn his drawing-room.\n-201\n\nHe by no means gave up his shop. On the contrary, he kept well abreast of new discoveries. He followed\nthe great movement of chocolates; he was the first to introduce \"cocoa\" and \"revalenta\" into the\nSeine-Inferieure. He was enthusiastic about the hydro-electric Pulvermacher chains; he wore one himself,\nand when at night he took off his flannel vest, Madame Homais stood quite dazzled before the golden\nspiral beneath which he was hidden, and felt her ardour redouble for this man more bandaged than a\nScythian, and splendid as one of the Magi.\nHe had fine ideas about Emma's tomb. First he proposed a broken column with some drapery, next a\npyramid, then a Temple of Vesta, a sort of rotunda, or else a \"mass of ruins.\" And in all his plans Homais\nalways stuck to the weeping willow, which he looked upon as the indispensable symbol of sorrow.\nCharles and he made a journey to Rouen together to look at some tombs at a funeral furnisher's,\naccompanied by an artist, one Vaufrylard, a friend of Bridoux's, who made puns all the time. At last, after\nhaving examined some hundred designs, having ordered an estimate and made another journey to Rouen,\nCharles decided in favour of a mausoleum, which on the two principal sides was to have a \"spirit bearing\nan extinguished torch.\"\nAs to the inscription, Homais could think of nothing so fine as Sta viator[23], and he got no further; he\nracked his brain, he constantly repeated Sta viator. At last he hit upon Amabilen conjugem calcas[24],\nwhich was adopted.\n[23] Rest traveler.\n[24] Tread upon a loving wife.\nA strange thing was that Bovary, while continually thinking of Emma, was forgetting her. He grew\ndesperate as he felt this image fading from his memory in spite of all efforts to retain it. Yet every night\nhe dreamt of her; it was always the same dream. He drew near her, but when he was about to clasp her she\nfell into decay in his arms.\nFor a week he was seen going to church in the evening. Monsieur Bournisien even paid him two or three\nvisits, then gave him up. Moreover, the old fellow was growing intolerant, fanatic, said Homais. He\nthundered against the spirit of the age, and never failed, every other week, in his sermon, to recount the\ndeath agony of Voltaire, who died devouring his excrements, as everyone knows.\nIn spite of the economy with which Bovary lived, he was far from being able to pay off his old debts.\nLheureux refused to renew any more bills. A distraint became imminent. Then he appealed to his mother,\nwho consented to let him take a mortgage on her property, but with a great many recriminations against\nEmma; and in return for her sacrifice she asked for a shawl that had escaped the depredations of Felicite.\nCharles refused to give it her; they quarrelled.\nShe made the first overtures of reconciliation by offering to have the little girl, who could help her in the\nhouse, to live with her. Charles consented to this, but when the time for parting came, all his courage\nfailed him. Then there was a final, complete rupture.\nAs his affections vanished, he clung more closely to the love of his child. She made him anxious,\nhowever, for she coughed sometimes, and had red spots on her cheeks.\nOpposite his house, flourishing and merry, was the family of the chemist, with whom everything was\nprospering. Napoleon helped him in the laboratory, Athalie embroidered him a skullcap, Irma cut out\nrounds of paper to cover the preserves, and Franklin recited Pythagoras' table in a breath. He was the\n-202\n\nhappiest of fathers, the most fortunate of men.\nNot so! A secret ambition devoured him. Homais hankered after the cross of the Legion of Honour. He\nhad plenty of claims to it.\n\"First, having at the time of the cholera distinguished myself by a boundless devotion; second, by having\npublished, at my expense, various works of public utility, such as\" (and he recalled his pamphlet entitled,\n\"Cider, its manufacture and effects,\" besides observation on the lanigerous plant-louse, sent to the\nAcademy; his volume of statistics, and down to his pharmaceutical thesis); \"without counting that I am a\nmember of several learned societies\" (he was member of a single one).\n\"In short!\" he cried, making a pirouette, \"if it were only for distinguishing myself at fires!\"\nThen Homais inclined towards the Government. He secretly did the prefect great service during the\nelections. He sold himself--in a word, prostituted himself. He even addressed a petition to the sovereign\nin which he implored him to \"do him justice\"; he called him \"our good king,\" and compared him to Henri\nIV.\nAnd every morning the druggist rushed for the paper to see if his nomination were in it. It was never\nthere. At last, unable to bear it any longer, he had a grass plot in his garden designed to represent the Star\nof the Cross of Honour with two little strips of grass running from the top to imitate the ribband. He\nwalked round it with folded arms, meditating on the folly of the Government and the ingratitude of men.\nFrom respect, or from a sort of sensuality that made him carry on his investigations slowly, Charles had\nnot yet opened the secret drawer of a rosewood desk which Emma had generally used. One day, however,\nhe sat down before it, turned the key, and pressed the spring. All Leon's letters were there. There could be\nno doubt this time. He devoured them to the very last, ransacked every corner, all the furniture, all the\ndrawers, behind the walls, sobbing, crying aloud, distraught, mad. He found a box and broke it open with\na kick. Rodolphe's portrait flew full in his face in the midst of the overturned love-letters.\nPeople wondered at his despondency. He never went out, saw no one, refused even to visit his patients.\nThen they said \"he shut himself up to drink.\"\nSometimes, however, some curious person climbed on to the garden hedge, and saw with amazement this\nlong-bearded, shabbily clothed, wild man, who wept aloud as he walked up and down.\nIn the evening in summer he took his little girl with him and led her to the cemetery. They came back at\nnightfall, when the only light left in the Place was that in Binet's window.\nThe voluptuousness of his grief was, however, incomplete, for he had no one near him to share it, and he\npaid visits to Madame Lefrancois to be able to speak of her.\nBut the landlady only listened with half an ear, having troubles like himself. For Lheureux had at last\nestablished the \"Favorites du Commerce,\" and Hivert, who enjoyed a great reputation for doing errands,\ninsisted on a rise of wages, and was threatening to go over \"to the opposition shop.\"\nOne day when he had gone to the market at Argueil to sell his horse--his last resource--he met\nRodolphe.\nThey both turned pale when they caught sight of one another. Rodolphe, who had only sent his card, first\nstammered some apologies, then grew bolder, and even pushed his assurance (it was in the month of\n-203\n\nAugust and very hot) to the length of inviting him to have a bottle of beer at the public-house.\nLeaning on the table opposite him, he chewed his cigar as he talked, and Charles was lost in reverie at this\nface that she had loved. He seemed to see again something of her in it. It was a marvel to him. He would\nhave liked to have been this man.\nThe other went on talking agriculture, cattle, pasturage, filling out with banal phrases all the gaps where\nan allusion might slip in. Charles was not listening to him; Rodolphe noticed it, and he followed the\nsuccession of memories that crossed his face. This gradually grew redder; the nostrils throbbed fast, the\nlips quivered. There was at last a moment when Charles, full of a sombre fury, fixed his eyes on\nRodolphe, who, in something of fear, stopped talking. But soon the same look of weary lassitude came\nback to his face.\n\"I don't blame you,\" he said.\nRodolphe was dumb. And Charles, his head in his hands, went on in a broken voice, and with the resigned\naccent of infinite sorrow--\n\"No, I don't blame you now.\"\nHe even added a fine phrase, the only one he ever made--\n\"It is the fault of fatality!\"\nRodolphe, who had managed the fatality, thought the remark very offhand from a man in his position,\ncomic even, and a little mean.\nThe next day Charles went to sit down on the seat in the arbour. Rays of light were straying through the\ntrellis, the vine leaves threw their shadows on the sand, the jasmines perfumed the air, the heavens were\nblue, Spanish flies buzzed round the lilies in bloom, and Charles was suffocating like a youth beneath the\nvague love influences that filled his aching heart.\nAt seven o'clock little Berthe, who had not seen him all the afternoon, went to fetch him to dinner.\nHis head was thrown back against the wall, his eyes closed, his mouth open, and in his hand was a long\ntress of black hair.\n\"Come along, papa,\" she said.\nAnd thinking he wanted to play; she pushed him gently. He fell to the ground. He was dead.\nThirty-six hours after, at the druggist's request, Monsieur Canivet came thither. He made a post-mortem\nand found nothing.\nWhen everything had been sold, twelve francs seventy-five centimes remained, that served to pay for\nMademoiselle Bovary's going to her grandmother. The good woman died the same year; old Rouault was\nparalysed, and it was an aunt who took charge of her. She is poor, and sends her to a cotton-factory to\nearn a living.\nSince Bovary's death three doctors have followed one another at Yonville without any success, so\nseverely did Homais attack them. He has an enormous practice; the authorities treat him with\n-204\n\nconsideration, and public opinion protects him.\nHe has just received the cross of the Legion of Honour.\n-205"

Vauquer (_nee_ de Conflans) is an elderly person, who for the past forty years has kept a\nlodging-house in the Rue Nueve-Sainte-Genevieve, in the district that lies between the Latin Quarter and\nthe Faubourg Saint-Marcel. Her house (known in the neighborhood as the _Maison Vauquer_) receives\nmen and women, old and young, and no word has ever been breathed against her respectable\nestablishment; but, at the same time, it must be said that as a matter of fact no young woman has been\nunder her roof for thirty years, and that if a young man stays there for any length of time it is a sure sign\nthat his allowance must be of the slenderest. In 1819, however, the time when this drama opens, there was\nan almost penniless young girl among Mme. Vauquer's boarders.\nThat word drama has been somewhat discredited of late; it has been overworked and twisted to\nstrange uses in these days of dolorous literature; but it must do service again here, not because this story\nis dramatic in the restricted sense of the word, but because some tears may perhaps be shed _intra et extra\nmuros_ before it is over.\nWill any one without the walls of Paris understand it? It is open to doubt. The only audience who\ncould appreciate the results of close observation, the careful reproduction of minute detail and local color,\nare dwellers between the heights of Montrouge and Montmartre, in a vale of crumbling stucco watered by\nstreams of black mud, a vale of sorrows which are real and joys too often hollow; but this audience is so\naccustomed to terrible sensations, that only some unimaginable and well-neigh impossible woe could\nproduce any lasting impression there. Now and again there are tragedies so awful and so grand by reason\nof the complication of virtues and vices that bring them about, that egotism and selfishness are forced to\npause and are moved to pity; but the impression that they receive is like a luscious fruit, soon consumed.\nCivilization, like the car of Juggernaut, is scarcely stayed perceptibly in its progress by a heart less easy to\nbreak than the others that lie in its course; this also is broken, and Civilization continues on her course\ntriumphant. And you, too, will do the like; you who with this book in your white hand will sink back\namong the cushions of your armchair, and say to yourself, \"Perhaps this may amuse me.\" You will read\nthe story of Father Goriot's secret woes, and, dining thereafter with an unspoiled appetite, will lay the\nblame of your insensibility upon the writer, and accuse him of exaggeration, of writing romances. Ah!\nonce for all, this drama is neither a fiction nor a romance! _All is true_,--so true, that every one can\ndiscern the elements of the tragedy in his own house, perhaps in his own heart.\nThe lodging-house is Mme. Vauquer's own property. It is still standing in the lower end of the\nRue Nueve-Sainte-Genevieve, just where the road slopes so sharply down to the Rue de l'Arbalete, that\nwheeled traffic seldom passes that way, because it is so stony and steep. This position is sufficient to\naccount for the silence prevalent in the streets shut in between the dome of the Pantheon and the dome of\nthe Val-de-Grace, two conspicuous public buildings which give a yellowish tone to the landscape and\ndarken the whole district that lies beneath the shadow of their leaden-hued cupolas.\nIn that district the pavements are clean and dry, there is neither mud nor water in the gutters, grass\ngrows in the chinks of the walls. The most heedless passer-by feels the depressing influences of a place\nwhere the sound of wheels creates a sensation; there is a grim look about the houses, a suggestion of a jail\n\nabout those high garden walls. A Parisian straying into a suburb apparently composed of lodging-houses\nand public institutions would see poverty and dullness, old age lying down to die, and joyous youth\ncondemned to drudgery. It is the ugliest quarter of Paris, and, it may be added, the least known. But,\nbefore all things, the Rue Nueve-Sainte-Genevieve is like a bronze frame for a picture for which the mind\ncannot be too well prepared by the contemplation of sad hues and sober images. Even so, step by step the\ndaylight decreases, and the cicerone's droning voice grows hollower as the traveler descends into the\nCatacombs. The comparison holds good! Who shall say which is more ghastly, the sight of the bleached\nskulls or of dried-up human hearts?\nThe front of the lodging-house is at right angles to the road, and looks out upon a little garden, so\nthat you see the side of the house in section, as it were, from the Rue Nueve-Sainte-Genevieve. Beneath\nthe wall of the house front there lies a channel, a fathom wide, paved with cobble-stones, and beside it\nruns a graveled walk bordered by geraniums and oleanders and pomegranates set in great blue and white\nglazed earthenware pots. Access into the graveled walk is afforded by a door, above which the words\nMAISON VAUQUER may be read, and beneath, in rather smaller letters, \"_Lodgings for both sexes,\netc._\"\nDuring the day a glimpse into the garden is easily obtained through a wicket to which a bell is\nattached. On the opposite wall, at the further end of the graveled walk, a green marble arch was painted\nonce upon a time by a local artist, and in this semblance of a shrine a statue representing Cupid is\ninstalled; a Parisian Cupid, so blistered and disfigured that he looks like a candidate for one of the\nadjacent hospitals, and might suggest an allegory to lovers of symbolism. The half-obliterated inscription\non the pedestal beneath determines the date of this work of art, for it bears witness to the widespread\nenthusiasm felt for Voltaire on his return to Paris in 1777:\n\"Whoe'er thou art, thy master see;\nHe is, or was, or ought to be.\"\nAt night the wicket gate is replaced by a solid door. The little garden is no wider than the front of\nthe house; it is shut in between the wall of the street and the partition wall of the neighboring house. A\nmantle of ivy conceals the bricks and attracts the eyes of passers-by to an effect which is picturesque in\nParis, for each of the walls is covered with trellised vines that yield a scanty dusty crop of fruit, and\nfurnish besides a subject of conversation for Mme. Vauquer and her lodgers; every year the widow\ntrembles for her vintage.\nA straight path beneath the walls on either side of the garden leads to a clump of lime-trees at the\nfurther end of it; _line_-trees, as Mme. Vauquer persists in calling them, in spite of the fact that she was a\nde Conflans, and regardless of repeated corrections from her lodgers.\nThe central space between the walls is filled with artichokes and rows of pyramid fruit-trees, and\nsurrounded by a border of lettuce, pot-herbs, and parsley. Under the lime-trees there are a few\ngreen-painted garden seats and a wooden table, and hither, during the dog-days, such of the lodgers as are\nrich enough to indulge in a cup of coffee come to take their pleasure, though it is hot enough to roast eggs\neven in the shade.\nThe house itself is three stories high, without counting the attics under the roof. It is built of\nrough stone, and covered with the yellowish stucco that gives a mean appearance to almost every house in\nParis. There are five windows in each story in the front of the house; all the blinds visible through the\n\nsmall square panes are drawn up awry, so that the lines are all at cross purposes. At the side of the house\nthere are but two windows on each floor, and the lowest of all are adorned with a heavy iron grating.\nBehind the house a yard extends for some twenty feet, a space inhabited by a happy family of\npigs, poultry, and rabbits; the wood-shed is situated on the further side, and on the wall between the\nwood-shed and the kitchen window hangs the meat-safe, just above the place where the sink discharges\nits greasy streams. The cook sweeps all the refuse out through a little door into the Rue\nNueve-Sainte-Genevieve, and frequently cleanses the yard with copious supplies of water, under pain of\npestilence.\nThe house might have been built on purpose for its present uses. Access is given by a French\nwindow to the first room on the ground floor, a sitting-room which looks out upon the street through the\ntwo barred windows already mentioned. Another door opens out of it into the dining-room, which is\nseparated from the kitchen by the well of the staircase, the steps being constructed partly of wood, partly\nof tiles, which are colored and beeswaxed. Nothing can be more depressing than the sight of that\nsitting-room. The furniture is covered with horse hair woven in alternate dull and glossy stripes. There is\na round table in the middle, with a purplish-red marble top, on which there stands, by way of ornament,\nthe inevitable white china tea-service, covered with a half-effaced gilt network. The floor is sufficiently\nuneven, the wainscot rises to elbow height, and the rest of the wall space is decorated with a varnished\npaper, on which the principal scenes from _Telemaque_ are depicted, the various classical personages\nbeing colored. The subject between the two windows is the banquet given by Calypso to the son of\nUlysses, displayed thereon for the admiration of the boarders, and has furnished jokes these forty years to\nthe young men who show themselves superior to their position by making fun of the dinners to which\npoverty condemns them. The hearth is always so clean and neat that it is evident that a fire is only kindled\nthere on great occasions; the stone chimney-piece is adorned by a couple of vases filled with faded\nartificial flowers imprisoned under glass shades, on either side of a bluish marble clock in the very worst\ntaste.\nThe first room exhales an odor for which there is no name in the language, and which should be\ncalled the _odeur de pension_. The damp atmosphere sends a chill through you as you breathe it; it has a\nstuffy, musty, and rancid quality; it permeates your clothing; after-dinner scents seem to be mingled in it\nwith smells from the kitchen and scullery and the reek of a hospital. It might be possible to describe it if\nsome one should discover a process by which to distil from the atmosphere all the nauseating elements\nwith which it is charged by the catarrhal exhalations of every individual lodger, young or old. Yet, in\nspite of these stale horrors, the sitting-room is as charming and as delicately perfumed as a boudoir, when\ncompared with the adjoining dining-room.\nThe paneled walls of that apartment were once painted some color, now a matter of conjecture,\nfor the surface is incrusted with accumulated layers of grimy deposit, which cover it with fantastic\noutlines. A collection of dim-ribbed glass decanters, metal discs with a satin sheen on them, and piles of\nblue-edged earthenware plates of Touraine ware cover the sticky surfaces of the sideboards that line the\nroom. In a corner stands a box containing a set of numbered pigeon-holes, in which the lodgers' table\nnapkins, more or less soiled and stained with wine, are kept. Here you see that indestructible furniture\nnever met with elsewhere, which finds its way into lodging-houses much as the wrecks of our civilization\ndrift into hospitals for incurables. You expect in such places as these to find the weather-house whence a\nCapuchin issues on wet days; you look to find the execrable engravings which spoil your appetite, framed\nevery one in a black varnished frame, with a gilt beading round it; you know the sort of tortoise-shell\nclock-case, inlaid with brass; the green stove, the Argand lamps, covered with oil and dust, have met your\neyes before. The oilcloth which covers the long table is so greasy that a waggish _externe_ will write his\n\nname on the surface, using his thumb-nail as a style. The chairs are broken-down invalids; the wretched\nlittle hempen mats slip away from under your feet without slipping away for good; and finally, the\nfoot-warmers are miserable wrecks, hingeless, charred, broken away about the holes. It would be\nimpossible to give an idea of the old, rotten, shaky, cranky, worm-eaten, halt, maimed, one-eyed, rickety,\nand ramshackle condition of the furniture without an exhaustive description, which would delay the\nprogress of the story to an extent that impatient people would not pardon. The red tiles of the floor are full\nof depressions brought about by scouring and periodical renewings of color. In short, there is no illusory\ngrace left to the poverty that reigns here; it is dire, parsimonious, concentrated, threadbare poverty; as yet\nit has not sunk into the mire, it is only splashed by it, and though not in rags as yet, its clothing is ready to\ndrop to pieces.\nThis apartment is in all its glory at seven o'clock in the morning, when Mme. Vauquer's cat\nappears, announcing the near approach of his mistress, and jumps upon the sideboards to sniff at the milk\nin the bowls, each protected by a plate, while he purrs his morning greeting to the world. A moment later\nthe widow shows her face; she is tricked out in a net cap attached to a false front set on awry, and shuffles\ninto the room in her slipshod fashion. She is an oldish woman, with a bloated countenance, and a nose\nlike a parrot's beak set in the middle of it; her fat little hands (she is as sleek as a church rat) and her\nshapeless, slouching figure are in keeping with the room that reeks of misfortune, where hope is reduced\nto speculate for the meanest stakes. Mme. Vauquer alone can breathe that tainted air without being\ndisheartened by it. Her face is as fresh as a frosty morning in autumn; there are wrinkles about the eyes\nthat vary in their expression from the set smile of a ballet-dancer to the dark, suspicious scowl of a\ndiscounter of bills; in short, she is at once the embodiment and interpretation of her lodging-house, as\nsurely as her lodging-house implies the existence of its mistress. You can no more imagine the one\nwithout the other, than you can think of a jail without a turnkey. The unwholesome corpulence of the little\nwoman is produced by the life she leads, just as typhus fever is bred in the tainted air of a hospital. The\nvery knitted woolen petticoat that she wears beneath a skirt made of an old gown, with the wadding\nprotruding through the rents in the material, is a sort of epitome of the sitting-room, the dining-room, and\nthe little garden; it discovers the cook, it foreshadows the lodgers--the picture of the house is completed\nby the portrait of its mistress.\nMme. Vauquer at the age of fifty is like all women who \"have seen a deal of trouble.\" She has the\nglassy eyes and innocent air of a trafficker in flesh and blood, who will wax virtuously indignant to obtain\na higher price for her services, but who is quite ready to betray a Georges or a Pichegru, if a Georges or a\nPichegru were in hiding and still to be betrayed, or for any other expedient that may alleviate her lot. Still,\n\"she is a good woman at bottom,\" said the lodgers who believed that the widow was wholly dependent\nupon the money that they paid her, and sympathized when they heard her cough and groan like one of\nthemselves.\nWhat had M. Vauquer been? The lady was never very explicit on this head. How had she lost her\nmoney? \"Through trouble,\" was her answer. He had treated her badly, had left her nothing but her eyes to\ncry over his cruelty, the house she lived in, and the privilege of pitying nobody, because, so she was wont\nto say, she herself had been through every possible misfortune.\nSylvie, the stout cook, hearing her mistress' shuffling footsteps, hastened to serve the lodgers'\nbreakfasts. Beside those who lived in the house, Mme. Vauquer took boarders who came for their meals;\nbut these _externes_ usually only came to dinner, for which they paid thirty francs a month.\nAt the time when this story begins, the lodging-house contained seven inmates. The best rooms in\nthe house were on the first story, Mme. Vauquer herself occupying the least important, while the rest were\n\nlet to a Mme. Couture, the widow of a commissary-general in the service of the Republic. With her lived\nVictorine Taillefer, a schoolgirl, to whom she filled the place of mother. These two ladies paid eighteen\nhundred francs a year.\nThe two sets of rooms on the second floor were respectively occupied by an old man named\nPoiret and a man of forty or thereabouts, the wearer of a black wig and dyed whiskers, who gave out that\nhe was a retired merchant, and was addressed as M. Vautrin. Two of the four rooms on the third floor\nwere also let--one to an elderly spinster, a Mlle. Michonneau, and the other to a retired manufacturer of\nvermicelli, Italian paste and starch, who allowed the others to address him as \"Father Goriot.\" The\nremaining rooms were allotted to various birds of passage, to impecunious students, who like \"Father\nGoriot\" and Mlle. Michonneau, could only muster forty-five francs a month to pay for their board and\nlodging. Mme. Vauquer had little desire for lodgers of this sort; they ate too much bread, and she only\ntook them in default of better.\nAt that time one of the rooms was tenanted by a law student, a young man from the neighborhood\nof Angouleme, one of a large family who pinched and starved themselves to spare twelve hundred francs\na year for him. Misfortune had accustomed Eugene de Rastignac, for that was his name, to work. He\nbelonged to the number of young men who know as children that their parents' hopes are centered on\nthem, and deliberately prepare themselves for a great career, subordinating their studies from the first to\nthis end, carefully watching the indications of the course of events, calculating the probable turn that\naffairs will take, that they may be the first to profit by them. But for his observant curiosity, and the skill\nwith which he managed to introduce himself into the salons of Paris, this story would not have been\ncolored by the tones of truth which it certainly owes to him, for they are entirely due to his penetrating\nsagacity and desire to fathom the mysteries of an appalling condition of things, which was concealed as\ncarefully by the victim as by those who had brought it to pass.\nAbove the third story there was a garret where the linen was hung to dry, and a couple of attics.\nChristophe, the man-of-all-work, slept in one, and Sylvie, the stout cook, in the other. Beside the seven\ninmates thus enumerated, taking one year with another, some eight law or medical students dined in the\nhouse, as well as two or three regular comers who lived in the neighborhood. There were usually eighteen\npeople at dinner, and there was room, if need be, for twenty at Mme. Vauquer's table; at breakfast,\nhowever, only the seven lodgers appeared. It was almost like a family party. Every one came down in\ndressing-gown and slippers, and the conversation usually turned on anything that had happened the\nevening before; comments on the dress or appearance of the dinner contingent were exchanged in friendly\nconfidence.\nThese seven lodgers were Mme. Vauquer's spoiled children. Among them she distributed, with\nastronomical precision, the exact proportion of respect and attention due to the varying amounts they paid\nfor their board. One single consideration influenced all these human beings thrown together by chance.\nThe two second-floor lodgers only paid seventy-two francs a month. Such prices as these are confined to\nthe Faubourg Saint-Marcel and the district between La Bourbe and the Salpetriere; and, as might be\nexpected, poverty, more or less apparent, weighed upon them all, Mme. Couture being the sole exception\nto the rule.\nThe dreary surroundings were reflected in the costumes of the inmates of the house; all were alike\nthreadbare. The color of the men's coats were problematical; such shoes, in more fashionable quarters, are\nonly to be seen lying in the gutter; the cuffs and collars were worn and frayed at the edges; every limp\narticle of clothing looked like the ghost of its former self. The women's dresses were faded, old-fashioned,\ndyed and re-dyed; they wore gloves that were glazed with hard wear, much-mended lace, dingy ruffles,\n\ncrumpled muslin fichus. So much for their clothing; but, for the most part, their frames were solid\nenough; their constitutions had weathered the storms of life; their cold, hard faces were worn like coins\nthat have been withdrawn from circulation, but there were greedy teeth behind the withered lips. Dramas\nbrought to a close or still in progress are foreshadowed by the sight of such actors as these, not the dramas\nthat are played before the footlights and against a background of painted canvas, but dumb dramas of life,\nfrost-bound dramas that sere hearts like fire, dramas that do not end with the actors' lives.\nMlle. Michonneau, that elderly young lady, screened her weak eyes from the daylight by a soiled\ngreen silk shade with a rim of brass, an object fit to scare away the Angel of Pity himself. Her shawl, with\nits scanty, draggled fringe, might have covered a skeleton, so meagre and angular was the form beneath it.\nYet she must have been pretty and shapely once. What corrosive had destroyed the feminine outlines?\nWas it trouble, or vice, or greed? Had she loved too well? Had she been a second-hand clothes dealer, a\nfrequenter of the backstairs of great houses, or had she been merely a courtesan? Was she expiating the\nflaunting triumphs of a youth overcrowded with pleasures by an old age in which she was shunned by\nevery passer-by? Her vacant gaze sent a chill through you; her shriveled face seemed like a menace. Her\nvoice was like the shrill, thin note of the grasshopper sounding from the thicket when winter is at hand.\nShe said that she had nursed an old gentleman, ill of catarrh of the bladder, and left to die by his children,\nwho thought that he had nothing left. His bequest to her, a life annuity of a thousand francs, was\nperiodically disputed by his heirs, who mingled slander with their persecutions. In spite of the ravages of\nconflicting passions, her face retained some traces of its former fairness and fineness of tissue, some\nvestiges of the physical charms of her youth still survived.\nM. Poiret was a sort of automaton. He might be seen any day sailing like a gray shadow along the\nwalks of the Jardin des Plantes, on his head a shabby cap, a cane with an old yellow ivory handle in the\ntips of his thin fingers; the outspread skirts of his threadbare overcoat failed to conceal his meagre figure;\nhis breeches hung loosely on his shrunken limbs; the thin, blue-stockinged legs trembled like those of a\ndrunken man; there was a notable breach of continuity between the dingy white waistcoat and crumpled\nshirt frills and the cravat twisted about a throat like a turkey gobbler's; altogether, his appearance set\npeople wondering whether this outlandish ghost belonged to the audacious race of the sons of Japhet who\nflutter about on the Boulevard Italien. What devouring kind of toil could have so shriveled him? What\ndevouring passions had darkened that bulbous countenance, which would have seemed outrageous as a\ncaricature? What had he been? Well, perhaps he had been part of the machinery of justice, a clerk in the\noffice to which the executioner sends in his accounts,--so much for providing black veils for parricides, so\nmuch for sawdust, so much for pulleys and cord for the knife. Or he might have been a receiver at the\ndoor of a public slaughter-house, or a sub-inspector of nuisances. Indeed, the man appeared to have been\none of the beasts of burden in our great social mill; one of those Parisian Ratons whom their Bertrands do\nnot even know by sight; a pivot in the obscure machinery that disposes of misery and things unclean; one\nof those men, in short, at sight of whom we are prompted to remark that, \"After all, we cannot do without\nthem.\"\nStately Paris ignores the existence of these faces bleached by moral or physical suffering; but,\nthen, Paris is in truth an ocean that no line can plumb. You may survey its surface and describe it; but no\nmatter how numerous and painstaking the toilers in this sea, there will always be lonely and unexplored\nregions in its depths, caverns unknown, flowers and pearls and monsters of the deep overlooked or\nforgotten by the divers of literature. The Maison Vauquer is one of these curious monstrosities.\nTwo, however, of Mme. Vauquer's boarders formed a striking contrast to the rest. There was a\nsickly pallor, such as is often seen in anaemic girls, in Mlle. Victorine Taillefer's face; and her unvarying\nexpression of sadness, like her embarrassed manner and pinched look, was in keeping with the general\n\nwretchedness of the establishment in the Rue Nueve-Saint-Genevieve, which forms a background to this\npicture; but her face was young, there was youthfulness in her voice and elasticity in her movements. This\nyoung misfortune was not unlike a shrub, newly planted in an uncongenial soil, where its leaves have\nalready begun to wither. The outlines of her figure, revealed by her dress of the simplest and cheapest\nmaterials, were also youthful. There was the same kind of charm about her too slender form, her faintly\ncolored face and light-brown hair, that modern poets find in mediaeval statuettes; and a sweet expression,\na look of Christian resignation in the dark gray eyes. She was pretty by force of contrast; if she had been\nhappy, she would have been charming. Happiness is the poetry of woman, as the toilette is her tinsel. If\nthe delightful excitement of a ball had made the pale face glow with color; if the delights of a luxurious\nlife had brought the color to the wan cheeks that were slightly hollowed already; if love had put light into\nthe sad eyes, then Victorine might have ranked among the fairest; but she lacked the two things which\ncreate woman a second time--pretty dresses and love-letters.\nA book might have been made of her story. Her father was persuaded that he had sufficient\nreason for declining to acknowledge her, and allowed her a bare six hundred francs a year; he had further\ntaken measures to disinherit his daughter, and had converted all his real estate into personalty, that he\nmight leave it undivided to his son. Victorine's mother had died broken-hearted in Mme. Couture's house;\nand the latter, who was a near relation, had taken charge of the little orphan. Unluckily, the widow of the\ncommissary-general to the armies of the Republic had nothing in the world but her jointure and her\nwidow's pension, and some day she might be obliged to leave the helpless, inexperienced girl to the\nmercy of the world. The good soul, therefore, took Victorine to mass every Sunday, and to confession\nonce a fortnight, thinking that, in any case, she would bring up her ward to be devout. She was right;\nreligion offered a solution of the problem of the young girl's future. The poor child loved the father who\nrefused to acknowledge her. Once every year she tried to see him to deliver her mother's message of\nforgiveness, but every year hitherto she had knocked at that door in vain; her father was inexorable. Her\nbrother, her only means of communication, had not come to see her for four years, and had sent her no\nassistance; yet she prayed to God to unseal her father's eyes and to soften her brother's heart, and no\naccusations mingled with her prayers. Mme. Couture and Mme. Vauquer exhausted the vocabulary of\nabuse, and failed to find words that did justice to the banker's iniquitous conduct; but while they heaped\nexecrations on the millionaire, Victorine's words were as gentle as the moan of the wounded dove, and\naffection found expression even in the cry drawn from her by pain.\nEugene de Rastignac was a thoroughly southern type; he had a fair complexion, blue eyes, black\nhair. In his figure, manner, and his whole bearing it was easy to see that he had either come of a noble\nfamily, or that, from his earliest childhood, he had been gently bred. If he was careful of his wardrobe,\nonly taking last year's clothes into daily wear, still upon occasion he could issue forth as a young man of\nfashion. Ordinarily he wore a shabby coat and waistcoat, the limp black cravat, untidily knotted, that\nstudents affect, trousers that matched the rest of his costume, and boots that had been resoled.\nVautrin (the man of forty with the dyed whiskers) marked a transition stage between these two\nyoung people and the others. He was the kind of man that calls forth the remark: \"He looks a jovial sort!\"\nHe had broad shoulders, a well-developed chest, muscular arms, and strong square-fisted hands; the joints\nof his fingers were covered with tufts of fiery red hair. His face was furrowed by premature wrinkles;\nthere was a certain hardness about it in spite of his bland and insinuating manner. His bass voice was by\nno means unpleasant, and was in keeping with his boisterous laughter. He was always obliging, always in\ngood spirits; if anything went wrong with one of the locks, he would soon unscrew it, take it to pieces,\nfile it, oil and clean and set it in order, and put it back in its place again; \"I am an old hand at it,\" he used\nto say. Not only so, he knew all about ships, the sea, France, foreign countries, men, business, law, great\nhouses and prisons, --there was nothing that he did not know. If any one complained rather more than\n\nusual, he would offer his services at once. He had several times lent money to Mme. Vauquer, or to the\nboarders; but, somehow, those whom he obliged felt that they would sooner face death than fail to repay\nhim; a certain resolute look, sometimes seen on his face, inspired fear of him, for all his appearance of\neasy good-nature. In the way he spat there was an imperturbable coolness which seemed to indicate that\nthis was a man who would not stick at a crime to extricate himself from a false position. His eyes, like\nthose of a pitiless judge, seemed to go to the very bottom of all questions, to read all natures, all feelings\nand thoughts. His habit of life was very regular; he usually went out after breakfast, returning in time for\ndinner, and disappeared for the rest of the evening, letting himself in about midnight with a latch key, a\nprivilege that Mme. Vauquer accorded to no other boarder. But then he was on very good terms with the\nwidow; he used to call her \"mamma,\" and put his arm round her waist, a piece of flattery perhaps not\nappreciated to the full! The worthy woman might imagine this to be an easy feat; but, as a matter of fact,\nno arm but Vautrin's was long enough to encircle her.\nIt was a characteristic trait of his generously to pay fifteen francs a month for the cup of coffee\nwith a dash of brandy in it, which he took after dinner. Less superficial observers than young men\nengulfed by the whirlpool of Parisian life, or old men, who took no interest in anything that did not\ndirectly concern them, would not have stopped short at the vaguely unsatisfactory impression that Vautrin\nmade upon them. He knew or guessed the concerns of every one about him; but none of them had been\nable to penetrate his thoughts, or to discover his occupation. He had deliberately made his apparent\ngood-nature, his unfailing readiness to oblige, and his high spirits into a barrier between himself and the\nrest of them, but not seldom he gave glimpses of appalling depths of character. He seemed to delight in\nscourging the upper classes of society with the lash of his tongue, to take pleasure in convicting it of\ninconsistency, in mocking at law and order with some grim jest worthy of Juvenal, as if some grudge\nagainst the social system rankled in him, as if there were some mystery carefully hidden away in his life.\nMlle. Taillefer felt attracted, perhaps unconsciously, by the strength of the one man, and the good\nlooks of the other; her stolen glances and secret thoughts were divided between them; but neither of them\nseemed to take any notice of her, although some day a chance might alter her position, and she would be a\nwealthy heiress. For that matter, there was not a soul in the house who took any trouble to investigate the\nvarious chronicles of misfortunes, real or imaginary, related by the rest. Each one regarded the others with\nindifference, tempered by suspicion; it was a natural result of their relative positions. Practical assistance\nnot one could give, this they all knew, and they had long since exhausted their stock of condolence over\nprevious discussions of their grievances. They were in something the same position as an elderly couple\nwho have nothing left to say to each other. The routine of existence kept them in contact, but they were\nparts of a mechanism which wanted oil. There was not one of them but would have passed a blind man\nbegging in the street, not one that felt moved to pity by a tale of misfortune, not one who did not see in\ndeath the solution of the all-absorbing problem of misery which left them cold to the most terrible anguish\nin others.\nThe happiest of these hapless beings was certainly Mme. Vauquer, who reigned supreme over this\nhospital supported by voluntary contributions. For her, the little garden, which silence, and cold, and rain,\nand drought combined to make as dreary as an Asian _steppe_, was a pleasant shaded nook; the gaunt\nyellow house, the musty odors of a back shop had charms for her, and for her alone. Those cells belonged\nto her. She fed those convicts condemned to penal servitude for life, and her authority was recognized\namong them. Where else in Paris would they have found wholesome food in sufficient quantity at the\nprices she charged them, and rooms which they were at liberty to make, if not exactly elegant or\ncomfortable, at any rate clean and healthy? If she had committed some flagrant act of injustice, the victim\nwould have borne it in silence.\n\nSuch a gathering contained, as might have been expected, the elements out of which a complete\nsociety might be constructed. And, as in a school, as in the world itself, there was among the eighteen\nmen and women who met round the dinner table a poor creature, despised by all the others, condemned to\nbe the butt of all their jokes. At the beginning of Eugene de Rastignac's second twelvemonth, this figure\nsuddenly started out into bold relief against the background of human forms and faces among which the\nlaw student was yet to live for another two years to come. This laughing-stock was the retired\nvermicelli-merchant, Father Goriot, upon whose face a painter, like the historian, would have\nconcentrated all the light in his picture.\nHow had it come about that the boarders regarded him with a half-malignant contempt? Why did\nthey subject the oldest among their number to a kind of persecution, in which there was mingled some\npity, but no respect for his misfortunes? Had he brought it on himself by some eccentricity or absurdity,\nwhich is less easily forgiven or forgotten than more serious defects? The question strikes at the root of\nmany a social injustice. Perhaps it is only human nature to inflict suffering on anything that will endure\nsuffering, whether by reason of its genuine humility, or indifference, or sheer helplessness. Do we not,\none and all, like to feel our strength even at the expense of some one or of something? The poorest sample\nof humanity, the street arab, will pull the bell handle at every street door in bitter weather, and scramble\nup to write his name on the unsullied marble of a monument.\nIn the year 1813, at the age of sixty-nine or thereabouts, \"Father Goriot\" had sold his business and\nretired--to Mme. Vauquer's boarding house. When he first came there he had taken the rooms now\noccupied by Mme. Couture; he had paid twelve hundred francs a year like a man to whom five louis more\nor less was a mere trifle. For him Mme. Vauquer had made various improvements in the three rooms\ndestined for his use, in consideration of a certain sum paid in advance, so it was said, for the miserable\nfurniture, that is to say, for some yellow cotton curtains, a few chairs of stained wood covered with\nUtrecht velvet, several wretched colored prints in frames, and wall papers that a little suburban tavern\nwould have disdained. Possibly it was the careless generosity with which Father Goriot allowed himself\nto be overreached at this period of his life (they called him Monsieur Goriot very respectfully then) that\ngave Mme. Vauquer the meanest opinion of his business abilities; she looked on him as an imbecile\nwhere money was concerned.\nGoriot had brought with him a considerable wardrobe, the gorgeous outfit of a retired tradesman\nwho denies himself nothing. Mme. Vauquer's astonished eyes beheld no less than eighteen\ncambric-fronted shirts, the splendor of their fineness being enhanced by a pair of pins each bearing a large\ndiamond, and connected by a short chain, an ornament which adorned the vermicelli-maker's shirt front.\nHe usually wore a coat of corn-flower blue; his rotund and portly person was still further set off by a\nclean white waistcoat, and a gold chain and seals which dangled over that broad expanse. When his\nhostess accused him of being \"a bit of a beau,\" he smiled with the vanity of a citizen whose foible is\ngratified. His cupboards (_ormoires_, as he called them in the popular dialect) were filled with a quantity\nof plate that he brought with him. The widow's eyes gleamed as she obligingly helped him to unpack the\nsoup ladles, table-spoons, forks, cruet-stands, tureens, dishes, and breakfast services--all of silver, which\nwere duly arranged upon shelves, besides a few more or less handsome pieces of plate, all weighing no\ninconsiderable number of ounces; he could not bring himself to part with these gifts that reminded him of\npast domestic festivals.\n\"This was my wife's present to me on the first anniversary of our wedding day,\" he said to Mme.\nVauquer, as he put away a little silver posset dish, with two turtle-doves billing on the cover. \"Poor dear!\nshe spent on it all the money she had saved before we were married. Do you know, I would sooner\nscratch the earth with my nails for a living, madame, than part with that. But I shall be able to take my\n\ncoffee out of it every morning for the rest of my days, thank the Lord! I am not to be pitied. There's not\nmuch fear of my starving for some time to come.\"\nFinally, Mme. Vauquer's magpie's eye had discovered and read certain entries in the list of\nshareholders in the funds, and, after a rough calculation, was disposed to credit Goriot (worthy man) with\nsomething like ten thousand francs a year. From that day forward Mme. Vauquer (_nee_ de Conflans),\nwho, as a matter of fact, had seen forty-eight summers, though she would only own to thirty-nine of\nthem--Mme. Vauquer had her own ideas. Though Goriot's eyes seemed to have shrunk in their sockets,\nthough they were weak and watery, owing to some glandular affection which compelled him to wipe\nthem continually, she considered him to be a very gentlemanly and pleasant-looking man. Moreover, the\nwidow saw favorable indications of character in the well-developed calves of his legs and in his\nsquare-shaped nose, indications still further borne out by the worthy man's full-moon countenance and\nlook of stupid good-nature. This, in all probability, was a strongly-build animal, whose brains mostly\nconsisted in a capacity for affection. His hair, worn in _ailes de pigeon_, and duly powdered every\nmorning by the barber from the Ecole Polytechnique, described five points on his low forehead, and made\nan elegant setting to his face. Though his manners were somewhat boorish, he was always as neat as a\nnew pin and he took his snuff in a lordly way, like a man who knows that his snuff-box is always likely to\nbe filled with maccaboy, so that when Mme. Vauquer lay down to rest on the day of M. Goriot's\ninstallation, her heart, like a larded partridge, sweltered before the fire of a burning desire to shake off the\nshroud of Vauquer and rise again as Goriot. She would marry again, sell her boarding-house, give her\nhand to this fine flower of citizenship, become a lady of consequence in the quarter, and ask for\nsubscriptions for charitable purposes; she would make little Sunday excursions to Choisy, Soissy,\nGentilly; she would have a box at the theatre when she liked, instead of waiting for the author's tickets\nthat one of her boarders sometimes gave her, in July; the whole Eldorado of a little Parisian household\nrose up before Mme. Vauquer in her dreams. Nobody knew that she herself possessed forty thousand\nfrancs, accumulated _sou by sou_, that was her secret; surely as far as money was concerned she was a\nvery tolerable match. \"And in other respects, I am quite his equal,\" she said to herself, turning as if to\nassure herself of the charms of a form that the portly Sylvie found moulded in down feathers every\nmorning.\nFor three months from that day Mme. Veuve Vauquer availed herself of the services of M.\nGoriot's coiffeur, and went to some expense over her toilette, expense justifiable on the ground that she\nowed it to herself and her establishment to pay some attention to appearances when such\nhighly-respectable persons honored her house with their presence. She expended no small amount of\ningenuity in a sort of weeding process of her lodgers, announcing her intention of receiving henceforward\nnone but people who were in every way select. If a stranger presented himself, she let him know that M.\nGoriot, one of the best known and most highly-respected merchants in Paris, had singled out her\nboarding-house for a residence. She drew up a prospectus headed MAISON VAUQUER, in which it was\nasserted that hers was \"_one of the oldest and most highly recommended boarding-houses in the Latin\nQuarter_.\" \"From the windows of the house,\" thus ran the prospectus, \"there is a charming view of the\nVallee des Gobelins (so there is--from the third floor), and a _beautiful_ garden, _extending_ down to _an\navenue of lindens_ at the further end.\" Mention was made of the bracing air of the place and its quiet\nsituation.\nIt was this prospectus that attracted Mme. la Comtesse de l'Ambermesnil, a widow of six and\nthirty, who was awaiting the final settlement of her husband's affairs, and of another matter regarding a\npension due to her as the wife of a general who had died \"on the field of battle.\" On this Mme. Vauquer\nsaw to her table, lighted a fire daily in the sitting-room for nearly six months, and kept the promise of her\nprospectus, even going to some expense to do so. And the Countess, on her side, addressed Mme.\n\nVauquer as \"my dear,\" and promised her two more boarders, the Baronne de Vaumerland and the widow\nof a colonel, the late Comte de Picquoisie, who were about to leave a boarding-house in the Marais,\nwhere the terms were higher than at the Maison Vauquer. Both these ladies, moreover, would be very\nwell to do when the people at the War Office had come to an end of their formalities. \"But Government\ndepartments are always so dilatory,\" the lady added.\nAfter dinner the two widows went together up to Mme. Vauquer's room, and had a snug little chat\nover some cordial and various delicacies reserved for the mistress of the house. Mme. Vauquer's ideas as\nto Goriot were cordially approved by Mme. de l'Ambermesnil; it was a capital notion, which for that\nmatter she had guessed from the very first; in her opinion the vermicelli maker was an excellent man.\n\"Ah! my dear lady, such a well-preserved man of his age, as sound as my eyesight--a man who\nmight make a woman happy!\" said the widow.\nThe good-natured Countess turned to the subject of Mme. Vauquer's dress, which was not in\nharmony with her projects. \"You must put yourself on a war footing,\" said she.\nAfter much serious consideration the two widows went shopping together--they purchased a hat\nadorned with ostrich feathers and a cap at the Palais Royal, and the Countess took her friend to the\nMagasin de la Petite Jeannette, where they chose a dress and a scarf. Thus equipped for the campaign, the\nwidow looked exactly like the prize animal hung out for a sign above an a la mode beef shop; but she\nherself was so much pleased with the improvement, as she considered it, in her appearance, that she felt\nthat she lay under some obligation to the Countess; and, though by no means open-handed, she begged\nthat lady to accept a hat that cost twenty francs. The fact was that she needed the Countess' services on the\ndelicate mission of sounding Goriot; the countess must sing her praises in his ears. Mme. de\nl'Ambermesnil lent herself very good-naturedly to this manoeuvre, began her operations, and succeeded\nin obtaining a private interview; but the overtures that she made, with a view to securing him for herself,\nwere received with embarrassment, not to say a repulse. She left him, revolted by his coarseness.\n\"My angel,\" said she to her dear friend, \"you will make nothing of that man yonder. He is\nabsurdly suspicious, and he is a mean curmudgeon, an idiot, a fool; you would never be happy with him.\"\nAfter what had passed between M. Goriot and Mme. de l'Ambermesnil, the Countess would no\nlonger live under the same roof. She left the next day, forgot to pay for six months' board, and left behind\nher wardrobe, cast-off clothing to the value of five francs. Eagerly and persistently as Mme. Vauquer\nsought her quondam lodger, the Comtesse de l'Ambermesnil was never heard of again in Paris. The\nwidow often talked of this deplorable business, and regretted her own too confiding disposition. As a\nmatter of fact, she was as suspicious as a cat; but she was like many other people, who cannot trust their\nown kin and put themselves at the mercy of the next chance comer--an odd but common phenomenon,\nwhose causes may readily be traced to the depths of the human heart.\nPerhaps there are people who know that they have nothing more to look for from those with\nwhom they live; they have shown the emptiness of their hearts to their housemates, and in their secret\nselves they are conscious that they are severely judged, and that they deserve to be judged severely; but\nstill they feel an unconquerable craving for praises that they do not hear, or they are consumed by a desire\nto appear to possess, in the eyes of a new audience, the qualities which they have not, hoping to win the\nadmiration or affection of strangers at the risk of forfeiting it again some day. Or, once more, there are\nother mercenary natures who never do a kindness to a friend or a relation simply because these have a\nclaim upon them, while a service done to a stranger brings its reward to self-love. Such natures feel but\n\nlittle affection for those who are nearest to them; they keep their kindness for remoter circles of\nacquaintance, and show most to those who dwell on its utmost limits. Mme. Vauquer belonged to both\nthese essentially mean, false, and execrable classes.\n\"If I had been there at the time,\" Vautrin would say at the end of the story, \"I would have shown\nher up, and that misfortune would not have befallen you. I know that kind of phiz!\"\nLike all narrow natures, Mme. Vauquer was wont to confine her attention to events, and did not\ngo very deeply into the causes that brought them about; she likewise preferred to throw the blame of her\nown mistakes on other people, so she chose to consider that the honest vermicelli maker was responsible\nfor her misfortune. It had opened her eyes, so she said, with regard to him. As soon as she saw that her\nblandishments were in vain, and that her outlay on her toilette was money thrown away, she was not slow\nto discover the reason of his indifference. It became plain to her at once that there was _some other\nattraction_, to use her own expression. In short, it was evident that the hope she had so fondly cherished\nwas a baseless delusion, and that she would \"never make anything out of that man yonder,\" in the\nCountess' forcible phrase. The Countess seemed to have been a judge of character. Mme. Vauquer's\naversion was naturally more energetic than her friendship, for her hatred was not in proportion to her\nlove, but to her disappointed expectations. The human heart may find here and there a resting-place short\nof the highest height of affection, but we seldom stop in the steep, downward slope of hatred. Still, M.\nGoriot was a lodger, and the widow's wounded self-love could not vent itself in an explosion of wrath;\nlike a monk harassed by the prior of his convent, she was forced to stifle her sighs of disappointment, and\nto gulp down her craving for revenge. Little minds find gratification for their feelings, benevolent or\notherwise, by a constant exercise of petty ingenuity. The widow employed her woman's malice to devise a\nsystem of covert persecution. She began by a course of retrenchment --various luxuries which had found\ntheir way to the table appeared there no more.\n\"No more gherkins, no more anchovies; they have made a fool of me!\" she said to Sylvie one\nmorning, and they returned to the old bill of fare.\nThe thrifty frugality necessary to those who mean to make their way in the world had become an\ninveterate habit of life with M. Goriot. Soup, boiled beef, and a dish of vegetables had been, and always\nwould be, the dinner he liked best, so Mme. Vauquer found it very difficult to annoy a boarder whose\ntastes were so simple. He was proof against her malice, and in desperation she spoke to him and of him\nslightingly before the other lodgers, who began to amuse themselves at his expense, and so gratified her\ndesire for revenge.\nTowards the end of the first year the widow's suspicions had reached such a pitch that she began\nto wonder how it was that a retired merchant with a secure income of seven or eight thousand livres, the\nowner of such magnificent plate and jewelry handsome enough for a kept mistress, should be living in her\nhouse. Why should he devote so small a proportion of his money to his expenses? Until the first year was\nnearly at an end, Goriot had dined out once or twice every week, but these occasions came less\nfrequently, and at last he was scarcely absent from the dinner-table twice a month. It was hardly expected\nthat Mme. Vauquer should regard the increased regularity of her boarder's habits with complacency, when\nthose little excursions of his had been so much to her interest. She attributed the change not so much to a\ngradual diminution of fortune as to a spiteful wish to annoy his hostess. It is one of the most detestable\nhabits of a Liliputian mind to credit other people with its own malignant pettiness.\nUnluckily, towards the end of the second year, M. Goriot's conduct gave some color to the idle\ntalk about him. He asked Mme. Vauquer to give him a room on the second floor, and to make a\n\ncorresponding reduction in her charges. Apparently, such strict economy was called for, that he did\nwithout a fire all through the winter. Mme. Vauquer asked to be paid in advance, an arrangement to which\nM. Goriot consented, and thenceforward she spoke of him as \"Father Goriot.\"\nWhat had brought about this decline and fall? Conjecture was keen, but investigation was\ndifficult. Father Goriot was not communicative; in the sham countess' phrase he was \"a curmudgeon.\"\nEmpty-headed people who babble about their own affairs because they have nothing else to occupy them,\nnaturally conclude that if people say nothing of their doings it is because their doings will not bear being\ntalked about; so the highly respectable merchant became a scoundrel, and the late beau was an old rogue.\nOpinion fluctuated. Sometimes, according to Vautrin, who came about this time to live in the Maison\nVauquer, Father Goriot was a man who went on 'Change and _dabbled_ (to use the sufficiently expressive\nlanguage of the Stock Exchange) in stocks and shares after he had ruined himself by heavy speculation.\nSometimes it was held that he was one of those petty gamblers who nightly play for small stakes until\nthey win a few francs. A theory that he was a detective in the employ of the Home Office found favor at\none time, but Vautrin urged that \"Goriot was not sharp enough for one of that sort.\" There were yet other\nsolutions; Father Goriot was a skinflint, a shark of a money-lender, a man who lived by selling lottery\ntickets. He was by turns all the most mysterious brood of vice and shame and misery; yet, however vile\nhis life might be, the feeling of repulsion which he aroused in others was not so strong that he must be\nbanished from their society--he paid his way. Besides, Goriot had his uses, every one vented his spleen or\nsharpened his wit on him; he was pelted with jokes and belabored with hard words. The general\nconsensus of opinion was in favor of a theory which seemed the most likely; this was Mme. Vauquer's\nview. According to her, the man so well preserved at his time of life, as sound as her eyesight, with whom\na woman might be very happy, was a libertine who had strange tastes. These are the facts upon which\nMme. Vauquer's slanders were based.\nEarly one morning, some few months after the departure of the unlucky Countess who had\nmanaged to live for six months at the widow's expense, Mme. Vauquer (not yet dressed) heard the rustle\nof a silk dress and a young woman's light footstep on the stair; some one was going to Goriot's room. He\nseemed to expect the visit, for his door stood ajar. The portly Sylvie presently came up to tell her mistress\nthat a girl too pretty to be honest, \"dressed like a goddess,\" and not a speck of mud on her laced cashmere\nboots, had glided in from the street like a snake, had found the kitchen, and asked for M. Goriot's\nroom. Mme. Vauquer and the cook, listening, overheard several words affectionately spoken\nduring the visit, which lasted for some time. When M. Goriot went downstairs with the lady, the stout\nSylvie forthwith took her basket and followed the lover-like couple, under pretext of going to do her\nmarketing.\n\"M. Goriot must be awfully rich, all the same, madame,\" she reported on her return, \"to keep her\nin such style. Just imagine it! There was a splendid carriage waiting at the corner of the Place de\nl'Estrapade, and _she_ got into it.\"\nWhile they were at dinner that evening, Mme. Vauquer went to the window and drew the curtain,\nas the sun was shining into Goriot's eyes.\n\"You are beloved of fair ladies, M. Goriot--the sun seeks you out,\" she said, alluding to his\nvisitor. \"_Peste!_ you have good taste; she was very pretty.\"\n\"That was my daughter,\" he said, with a kind of pride in his voice, and the rest chose to consider\nthis as the fatuity of an old man who wishes to save appearances.\n\nA month after this visit M. Goriot received another. The same daughter who had come to see him\nthat morning came again after dinner, this time in evening dress. The boarders, in deep discussion in the\ndining-room, caught a glimpse of a lovely, fair-haired woman, slender, graceful, and much too\ndistinguished-looking to be a daughter of Father Goriot's.\n\"Two of them!\" cried the portly Sylvie, who did not recognize the lady of the first visit.\nA few days later, and another young lady--a tall, well-moulded brunette, with dark hair and bright\neyes--came to ask for M. Goriot.\n\"Three of them!\" said Sylvie.\nThen the second daughter, who had first come in the morning to see her father, came shortly\nafterwards in the evening. She wore a ball dress, and came in a carriage.\n\"Four of them!\" commented Mme. Vauquer and her plump handmaid. Sylvie saw not a trace of\nresemblance between this great lady and the girl in her simple morning dress who had entered her kitchen\non the occasion of her first visit.\nAt that time Goriot was paying twelve hundred francs a year to his landlady, and Mme. Vauquer\nsaw nothing out of the common in the fact that a rich man had four or five mistresses; nay, she thought it\nvery knowing of him to pass them off as his daughters. She was not at all inclined to draw a hard-and-fast\nline, or to take umbrage at his sending for them to the Maison Vauquer; yet, inasmuch as these visits\nexplained her boarder's indifference to her, she went so far (at the end of the second year) as to speak of\nhim as an \"ugly old wretch.\" When at length her boarder declined to nine hundred francs a year, she asked\nhim very insolently what he took her house to be, after meeting one of these ladies on the stairs. Father\nGoriot answered that the lady was his eldest daughter.\n\"So you have two or three dozen daughters, have you?\" said Mme. Vauquer sharply.\n\"I have only two,\" her boarder answered meekly, like a ruined man who is broken in to all the\ncruel usage of misfortune.\nTowards the end of the third year Father Goriot reduced his expenses still further; he went up to\nthe third story, and now paid forty-five francs a month. He did without snuff, told his hairdresser that he\nno longer required his services, and gave up wearing powder. When Goriot appeared for the first time in\nthis condition, an exclamation of astonishment broke from his hostess at the color of his hair--a dingy\nolive gray. He had grown sadder day by day under the influence of some hidden trouble; among all the\nfaces round the table, his was the most woe-begone. There was no longer any doubt. Goriot was an\nelderly libertine, whose eyes had only been preserved by the skill of the physician from the malign\ninfluence of the remedies necessitated by the state of his health. The disgusting color of his hair was a\nresult of his excesses and of the drugs which he had taken that he might continue his career. The poor old\nman's mental and physical condition afforded some grounds for the absurd rubbish talked about him.\nWhen his outfit was worn out, he replaced the fine linen by calico at fourteen _sous_ the ell. His\ndiamonds, his gold snuff-box, watch-chain and trinkets, disappeared one by one. He had left off wearing\nthe corn-flower blue coat, and was sumptuously arrayed, summer as well as winter, in a coarse\nchestnut-brown coat, a plush waistcoat, and doeskin breeches. He grew thinner and thinner; his legs were\n\nshrunken, his cheeks, once so puffed out by contented bourgeois prosperity, were covered with wrinkles,\nand the outlines of the jawbones were distinctly visible; there were deep furrows in his forehead. In the\nfourth year of his residence in the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Genevieve he was no longer like his former self. The\nhale vermicelli manufacturer, sixty-two years of age, who had looked scarce forty, the stout, comfortable,\nprosperous tradesman, with an almost bucolic air, and such a brisk demeanor that it did you good to look\nat him; the man with something boyish in his smile, had suddenly sunk into his dotage, and had become a\nfeeble, vacillating septuagenarian.\nThe keen, bright blue eyes had grown dull, and faded to a steel-gray color; the red inflamed rims\nlooked as though they had shed tears of blood. He excited feelings of repulsion in some, and of pity in\nothers. The young medical students who came to the house noticed the drooping of his lower lip and the\nconformation of the facial angle; and, after teasing him for some time to no purpose, they declared that\ncretinism was setting in.\nOne evening after dinner Mme. Vauquer said half banteringly to him, \"So those daughters of\nyours don't come to see you any more, eh?\" meaning to imply her doubts as to his paternity; but Father\nGoriot shrank as if his hostess had touched him with a sword-point.\n\"They come sometimes,\" he said in a tremulous voice.\n\"Aha! you still see them sometimes?\" cried the students. \"Bravo, Father Goriot!\"\nThe old man scarcely seemed to hear the witticisms at his expense that followed on the words; he\nhad relapsed into the dreamy state of mind that these superficial observers took for senile torpor, due to\nhis lack of intelligence. If they had only known, they might have been deeply interested by the problem of\nhis condition; but few problems were more obscure. It was easy, of course, to find out whether Goriot had\nreally been a vermicelli manufacturer; the amount of his fortune was readily discoverable; but the old\npeople, who were most inquisitive as to his concerns, never went beyond the limits of the Quarter, and\nlived in the lodging-house much as oysters cling to a rock. As for the rest, the current of life in Paris daily\nawaited them, and swept them away with it; so soon as they left the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Genevieve, they\nforgot the existence of the old man, their butt at dinner. For those narrow souls, or for careless youth, the\nmisery in Father Goriot's withered face and its dull apathy were quite incompatible with wealth or any\nsort of intelligence. As for the creatures whom he called his daughters, all Mme. Vauquer's boarders were\nof her opinion. With the faculty for severe logic sedulously cultivated by elderly women during long\nevenings of gossip till they can always find an hypothesis to fit all circumstances, she was wont to reason\nthus:\n\"If Father Goriot had daughters of his own as rich as those ladies who came here seemed to be, he\nwould not be lodging in my house, on the third floor, at forty-five francs a month; and he would not go\nabout dressed like a poor man.\"\nNo objection could be raised to these inferences. So by the end of the month of November 1819,\nat the time when the curtain rises on this drama, every one in the house had come to have a very decided\nopinion as to the poor old man. He had never had either wife or daughter; excesses had reduced him to\nthis sluggish condition; he was a sort of human mollusk who should be classed among the capulidoe, so\none of the dinner contingent, an _employe_ at the Museum, who had a pretty wit of his own. Poiret was\nan eagle, a gentleman, compared with Goriot. Poiret would join the talk, argue, answer when he was\nspoken to; as a matter of fact, his talk, arguments, and responses contributed nothing to the conversation,\nfor Poiret had a habit of repeating what the others said in different words; still, he did join in the talk; he\n\nwas alive, and seemed capable of feeling; while Father Goriot (to quote the Museum official again) was\ninvariably at zero degrees--Reaumur.\nEugene de Rastignac had just returned to Paris in a state of mind not unknown to young men who\nare conscious of unusual powers, and to those whose faculties are so stimulated by a difficult position,\nthat for the time being they rise above the ordinary level.\nRastignac's first year of study for the preliminary examinations in law had left him free to see the\nsights of Paris and to enjoy some of its amusements. A student has not much time on his hands if he sets\nhimself to learn the repertory of every theatre, and to study the ins and outs of the labyrinth of Paris. To\nknow its customs; to learn the language, and become familiar with the amusements of the capital, he must\nexplore its recesses, good and bad, follow the studies that please him best, and form some idea of the\ntreasures contained in galleries and museums.\nAt this stage of his career a student grows eager and excited about all sorts of follies that seem to\nhim to be of immense importance. He has his hero, his great man, a professor at the College de France,\npaid to talk down to the level of his audience. He adjusts his cravat, and strikes various attitudes for the\nbenefit of the women in the first galleries at the Opera-Comique. As he passes through all these\nsuccessive initiations, and breaks out of his sheath, the horizons of life widen around him, and at length\nhe grasps the plan of society with the different human strata of which it is composed.\nIf he begins by admiring the procession of carriages on sunny afternoons in the Champs-Elysees,\nhe soon reaches the further stage of envying their owners. Unconsciously, Eugene had served his\napprenticeship before he went back to Angouleme for the long vacation after taking his degrees as\nbachelor of arts and bachelor of law. The illusions of childhood had vanished, so also had the ideas he\nbrought with him from the provinces; he had returned thither with an intelligence developed, with loftier\nambitions, and saw things as they were at home in the old manor house. His father and mother, his two\nbrothers and two sisters, with an aged aunt, whose whole fortune consisted in annuities, lived on the little\nestate of Rastignac. The whole property brought in about three thousand francs; and though the amount\nvaried with the season (as must always be the case in a vine-growing district), they were obliged to spare\nan unvarying twelve hundred francs out of their income for him. He saw how constantly the poverty,\nwhich they had generously hidden from him, weighed upon them; he could not help comparing the\nsisters, who had seemed so beautiful to his boyish eyes, with women in Paris, who had realized the beauty\nof his dreams. The uncertain future of the whole family depended upon him. It did not escape his eyes\nthat not a crumb was wasted in the house, nor that the wine they drank was made from the second\npressing; a multitude of small things, which it is useless to speak of in detail here, made him burn to\ndistinguish himself, and his ambition to succeed increased tenfold.\nHe meant, like all great souls, that his success should be owing entirely to his merits; but his was\npre-eminently a southern temperament, the execution of his plans was sure to be marred by the vertigo\nthat seizes on youth when youth sees itself alone in a wide sea, uncertain how to spend its energies,\nwhither to steer its course, how to adapt its sails to the winds. At first he determined to fling himself heart\nand soul into his work, but he was diverted from this purpose by the need of society and connections; then\nhe saw how great an influence women exert in social life, and suddenly made up his mind to go out into\nthis world to seek a protectress there. Surely a clever and high-spirited young man, whose wit and\ncourage were set off to advantage by a graceful figure and the vigorous kind of beauty that readily strikes\na woman's imagination, need not despair of finding a protectress. These ideas occurred to him in his\ncountry walks with his sisters, whom he had once joined so gaily. The girls thought him very much\nchanged.\n\nHis aunt, Mme. de Marcillac, had been presented at court, and had moved among the brightest\nheights of that lofty region. Suddenly the young man's ambition discerned in those recollections of hers,\nwhich had been like nursery fairy tales to her nephews and nieces, the elements of a social success at least\nas important as the success which he had achieved at the Ecole de Droit. He began to ask his aunt about\nthose relations; some of the old ties might still hold good. After much shaking of the branches of the\nfamily tree, the old lady came to the conclusion that of all persons who could be useful to her nephew\namong the selfish genus of rich relations, the Vicomtesse de Beauseant was the least likely to refuse. To\nthis lady, therefore, she wrote in the old-fashioned style, recommending Eugene to her; pointing out to\nher nephew that if he succeeded in pleasing Mme. de Beauseant, the Vicomtesse would introduce him to\nother relations. A few days after his return to Paris, therefore, Rastignac sent his aunt's letter to Mme. de\nBeauseant. The Vicomtesse replied by an invitation to a ball for the following evening. This was the\nposition of affairs at the Maison Vauquer at the end of November 1819.\nA few days later, after Mme. de Beauseant's ball, Eugene came in at two o'clock in the morning.\nThe persevering student meant to make up for the lost time by working until daylight. It was the first time\nthat he had attempted to spend the night in this way in that silent quarter. The spell of a factitious energy\nwas upon him; he had beheld the pomp and splendor of the world. He had not dined at the Maison\nVauquer; the boarders probably would think that he would walk home at daybreak from the dance, as he\nhad done sometimes on former occasions, after a fete at the Prado, or a ball at the Odeon, splashing his\nsilk stockings thereby, and ruining his pumps.\nIt so happened that Christophe took a look into the street before drawing the bolts of the door;\nand Rastignac, coming in at that moment, could go up to his room without making any noise, followed by\nChristophe, who made a great deal. Eugene exchanged his dress suit for a shabby overcoat and slippers,\nkindled a fire with some blocks of patent fuel, and prepared for his night's work in such a sort that the\nfaint sounds he made were drowned by Christophe's heavy tramp on the stairs.\nEugene sat absorbed in thought for a few moments before plunging into his law books. He had\njust become aware of the fact that the Vicomtesse de Beauseant was one of the queens of fashion, that her\nhouse was thought to be the pleasantest in the Faubourg Saint-Germain. And not only so, she was, by\nright of her fortune, and the name she bore, one of the most conspicuous figures in that aristocratic world.\nThanks to the aunt, thanks to Mme. de Marcillac's letter of introduction, the poor student had been kindly\nreceived in that house before he knew the extent of the favor thus shown to him. It was almost like a\npatent of nobility to be admitted to those gilded salons; he had appeared in the most exclusive circle in\nParis, and now all doors were open for him. Eugene had been dazzled at first by the brilliant assembly,\nand had scarcely exchanged a few words with the Vicomtesse; he had been content to single out a\ngoddess among this throng of Parisian divinities, one of those women who are sure to attract a young\nman's fancy.\nThe Comtesse Anastasie de Restaud was tall and gracefully made; she had one of the prettiest\nfigures in Paris. Imagine a pair of great dark eyes, a magnificently moulded hand, a shapely foot. There\nwas a fiery energy in her movements; the Marquis de Ronquerolles had called her \"a thoroughbred,\" \"a\npure pedigree,\" these figures of speech have replaced the \"heavenly angel\" and Ossianic nomenclature;\nthe old mythology of love is extinct, doomed to perish by modern dandyism. But for Rastignac, Mme.\nAnastasie de Restaud was the woman for whom he had sighed. He had contrived to write his name twice\nupon the list of partners upon her fan, and had snatched a few words with her during the first quadrille.\n\"Where shall I meet you again, Madame?\" he asked abruptly, and the tones of his voice were full\nof the vehement energy that women like so well.\n\n\"Oh, everywhere!\" said she, \"in the Bois, at the Bouffons, in my own house.\"\nWith the impetuosity of his adventurous southern temper, he did all he could to cultivate an\nacquaintance with this lovely countess, making the best of his opportunities in the quadrille and during a\nwaltz that she gave him. When he told her that he was a cousin of Mme. de Beauseant's, the Countess,\nwhom he took for a great lady, asked him to call at her house, and after her parting smile, Rastignac felt\nconvinced that he must make this visit. He was so lucky as to light upon some one who did not laugh at\nhis ignorance, a fatal defect among the gilded and insolent youth of that period; the coterie of\nMaulincourts, Maximes de Trailles, de Marsays, Ronquerolles, Ajuda-Pintos, and Vandenesses who\nshone there in all the glory of coxcombry among the best-dressed women of fashion in Paris--Lady\nBrandon, the Duchesse de Langeais, the Comtesse de Kergarouet, Mme. de Serizy, the Duchesse de\nCarigliano, the Comtesse Ferraud, Mme. de Lanty, the Marquise d'Aiglemont, Mme. Firmiani, the\nMarquise de Listomere and the Marquise d'Espard, the Duchesse de Maufrigneuse and the Grandlieus.\nLuckily, therefore, for him, the novice happened upon the Marquis de Montriveau, the lover of the\nDuchesse de Langeais, a general as simple as a child; from him Rastignac learned that the Comtesse lived\nin the Rue du Helder.\nAh, what it is to be young, eager to see the world, greedily on the watch for any chance that\nbrings you nearer the woman of your dreams, and behold two houses open their doors to you! To set foot\nin the Vicomtesse de Beauseant's house in the Faubourg Saint-Germain; to fall on your knees before a\nComtesse de Restaud in the Chaussee d'Antin; to look at one glance across a vista of Paris\ndrawing-rooms, conscious that, possessing sufficient good looks, you may hope to find aid and protection\nthere in a feminine heart! To feel ambitious enough to spurn the tight-rope on which you must walk with\nthe steady head of an acrobat for whom a fall is impossible, and to find in a charming woman the best of\nall balancing poles.\nHe sat there with his thoughts for a while, Law on the one hand, and Poverty on the other,\nbeholding a radiant vision of a woman rise above the dull, smouldering fire. Who would not have paused\nand questioned the future as Eugene was doing? who would not have pictured it full of success? His\nwondering thoughts took wings; he was transported out of the present into that blissful future; he was\nsitting by Mme. de Restaud's side, when a sort of sigh, like the grunt of an overburdened St. Joseph, broke\nthe silence of the night. It vibrated through the student, who took the sound for a death groan. He opened\nhis door noiselessly, went out upon the landing, and saw a thin streak of light under Father Goriot's door.\nEugene feared that his neighbor had been taken ill; he went over and looked through the keyhole; the old\nman was busily engaged in an occupation so singular and so suspicious that Rastignac thought he was\nonly doing a piece of necessary service to society to watch the self-styled vermicelli maker's nocturnal\nindustries.\nThe table was upturned, and Goriot had doubtless in some way secured a silver plate and cup to\nthe bar before knotting a thick rope round them; he was pulling at this rope with such enormous force that\nthey were being crushed and twisted out of shape; to all appearance he meant to convert the richly\nwrought metal into ingots.\n\"_Peste!_ what a man!\" said Rastignac, as he watched Goriot's muscular arms; there was not a\nsound in the room while the old man, with the aid of the rope, was kneading the silver like dough. \"Was\nhe then, indeed, a thief, or a receiver of stolen goods, who affected imbecility and decrepitude, and lived\nlike a beggar that he might carry on his pursuits the more securely?\" Eugene stood for a moment\nrevolving these questions, then he looked again through the keyhole.\n\nFather Goriot had unwound his coil of rope; he had covered the table with a blanket, and was now\nemployed in rolling the flattened mass of silver into a bar, an operation which he performed with\nmarvelous dexterity.\n\"Why, he must be as strong as Augustus, King of Poland!\" said Eugene to himself when the bar\nwas nearly finished.\nFather Goriot looked sadly at his handiwork, tears fell from his eyes, he blew out the dip which\nhad served him for a light while he manipulated the silver, and Eugene heard him sigh as he lay down\nagain.\n\"He is mad,\" thought the student.\n\"_Poor child!_\" Father Goriot said aloud. Rastignac, hearing those words, concluded to keep\nsilence; he would not hastily condemn his neighbor. He was just in the doorway of his room when a\nstrange sound from the staircase below reached his ears; it might have been made by two men coming up\nin list slippers. Eugene listened; two men there certainly were, he could hear their breathing. Yet there had\nbeen no sound of opening the street door, no footsteps in the passage. Suddenly, too, he saw a faint gleam\nof light on the second story; it came from M. Vautrin's room.\n\"There are a good many mysteries here for a lodging-house!\" he said to himself.\nHe went part of the way downstairs and listened again. The rattle of gold reached his ears. In\nanother moment the light was put out, and again he distinctly heard the breathing of two men, but no\nsound of a door being opened or shut. The two men went downstairs, the faint sounds growing fainter as\nthey went.\n\"Who is there?\" cried Mme. Vauquer out of her bedroom window.\n\"I, Mme. Vauquer,\" answered Vautrin's deep bass voice. \"I am coming in.\"\n\"That is odd! Christophe drew the bolts,\" said Eugene, going back to his room. \"You have to sit\nup at night, it seems, if you really mean to know all that is going on about you in Paris.\"\nThese incidents turned his thought from his ambitious dreams; he betook himself to his work, but\nhis thought wandered back to Father Goriot's suspicious occupation; Mme. de Restaud's face swam again\nand again before his eyes like a vision of a brilliant future; and at last he lay down and slept with clenched\nfists. When a young man makes up his mind that he will work all night, the chances are that seven times\nout of ten he will sleep till morning. Such vigils do not begin before we are turned twenty.\nThe next morning Paris was wrapped in one of the dense fogs that throw the most punctual\npeople out in their calculations as to the time; even the most business-like folk fail to keep their\nappointments in such weather, and ordinary mortals wake up at noon and fancy it is eight o'clock. On this\nmorning it was half-past nine, and Mme. Vauquer still lay abed. Christophe was late, Sylvie was late, but\nthe two sat comfortably taking their coffee as usual. It was Sylvie's custom to take the cream off the milk\ndestined for the boarders' breakfast for her own, and to boil the remainder for some time, so that madame\nshould not discover this illegal exaction.\n\"Sylvie,\" said Christophe, as he dipped a piece of toast into the coffee, \"M. Vautrin, who is not\n\nsuch a bad sort, all the same, had two people come to see him again last night. If madame says anything,\nmind you say nothing about it.\"\n\"Has he given you something?\"\n\"He gave me a five-franc piece this month, which is as good as saying, 'Hold your tongue.'\"\n\"Except him and Mme. Couture, who doesn't look twice at every penny, there's no one in the\nhouse that doesn't try to get back with the left hand all that they give with the right at New Year,\" said\nSylvie.\n\"And, after all,\" said Christophe, \"what do they give you? A miserable five-franc piece. There is\nFather Goriot, who has cleaned his shoes himself these two years past. There is that old beggar Poiret,\nwho goes without blacking altogether; he would sooner drink it than put it on his boots. Then there is that\nwhipper-snapper of a student, who gives me a couple of francs. Two francs will not pay for my brushes,\nand he sells his old clothes, and gets more for them than they are worth. Oh! they're a shabby lot!\"\n\"Pooh!\" said Sylvie, sipping her coffee, \"our places are the best in the Quarter, that I know. But\nabout that great big chap Vautrin, Christophe; has any one told you anything about him?\"\n\"Yes. I met a gentleman in the street a few days ago; he said to me, 'There's a gentleman in your\nplace, isn't there? a tall man that dyes his whiskers?' I told him, 'No, sir; they aren't dyed. A gay fellow\nlike him hasn't the time to do it.' And when I told M. Vautrin about it afterwards, he said, 'Quite right, my\nboy. That is the way to answer them. There is nothing more unpleasant than to have your little\nweaknesses known; it might spoil many a match.'\"\n\"Well, and for my part,\" said Sylvie, \"a man tried to humbug me at the market wanting to know if\nI had seen him put on his shirt. Such bosh! There,\" she cried, interrupting herself, \"that's a quarter to ten\nstriking at the Val-de-Grace, and not a soul stirring!\"\n\"Pooh! they are all gone out. Mme. Couture and the girl went out at eight o'clock to take the\nwafer at Saint-Etienne. Father Goriot started off somewhere with a parcel, and the student won't be back\nfrom his lecture till ten o'clock. I saw them go while I was sweeping the stairs; Father Goriot knocked up\nagainst me, and his parcel was as hard as iron. What is the old fellow up to, I wonder? He is as good as a\nplaything for the rest of them; they can never let him alone; but he is a good man, all the same, and worth\nmore than all of them put together. He doesn't give you much himself, but he sometimes sends you with a\nmessage to ladies who fork out famous tips; they are dressed grandly, too.\"\n\"His daughters, as he calls them, eh? There are a dozen of them.\"\n\"I have never been to more than two--the two who came here.\"\n\"There is madame moving overhead; I shall have to go, or she will raise a fine racket. Just keep\nan eye on the milk, Christophe; don't let the cat get at it.\"\nSylvie went up to her mistress' room.\n\"Sylvie! How is this? It's nearly ten o'clock, and you let me sleep like a dormouse! Such a thing\nhas never happened before.\"\n\n\"It's the fog; it is that thick, you could cut it with a knife.\"\n\"But how about breakfast?\"\n\"Bah! the boarders are possessed, I'm sure. They all cleared out before there was a wink of\ndaylight.\"\n\"Do speak properly, Sylvie,\" Mme. Vauquer retorted; \"say a blink of daylight.\"\n\"Ah, well, madame, whichever you please. Anyhow, you can have breakfast at ten o'clock. La\nMichonnette and Poiret have neither of them stirred. There are only those two upstairs, and they are\nsleeping like the logs they are.\"\n\"But, Sylvie, you put their names together as if----\"\n\"As if what?\" said Sylvie, bursting into a guffaw. \"The two of them make a pair.\"\n\"It is a strange thing, isn't it, Sylvie, how M. Vautrin got in last night after Christophe had bolted\nthe door?\"\n\"Not at all, madame. Christophe heard M. Vautrin, and went down and undid the door. And here\nare you imagining that----?\"\n\"Give me my bodice, and be quick and get breakfast ready. Dish up the rest of the mutton with\nthe potatoes, and you can put the stewed pears on the table, those at five a penny.\"\nA few moments later Mme. Vauquer came down, just in time to see the cat knock down a plate\nthat covered a bowl of milk, and begin to lap in all haste.\n\"Mistigris!\" she cried.\nThe cat fled, but promptly returned to rub against her ankles.\n\"Oh! yes, you can wheedle, you old hypocrite!\" she said. \"Sylvie! Sylvie!\"\n\"Yes, madame; what is it?\"\n\"Just see what the cat has done!\"\n\"It is all that stupid Christophe's fault. I told him to stop and lay the table. What has become of\nhim? Don't you worry, madame; Father Goriot shall have it. I will fill it up with water, and he won't know\nthe difference; he never notices anything, not even what he eats.\"\n\"I wonder where the old heathen can have gone?\" said Mme. Vauquer, setting the plates round\nthe table.\n\"Who knows? He is up to all sorts of tricks.\"\n\"I have overslept myself,\" said Mme. Vauquer.\n\n\"But madame looks as fresh as a rose, all the same.\"\nThe door bell rang at that moment, and Vautrin came through the sitting-room, singing loudly:\n\"'Tis the same old story everywhere, A roving heart and a roving glance . .\n\"Oh! Mamma Vauquer! good-morning!\" he cried at the sight of his hostess, and he put his arm\ngaily round her waist.\n\"There! have done----\"\n\"'Impertinence!' Say it!\" he answered. \"Come, say it! Now, isn't that what you really mean? Stop\na bit, I will help you to set the table. Ah! I am a nice man, am I not?\n\"For the locks of brown and the golden hair\nA sighing lover . . .\n\"Oh! I have just seen something so funny----\n. . . . led by chance.\"\n\"What?\" asked the widow.\n\"Father Goriot in the goldsmith's shop in the Rue Dauphine at half-past eight this morning. They\nbuy old spoons and forks and gold lace there, and Goriot sold a piece of silver plate for a good round\nsum. It had been twisted out of shape very neatly for a man that's not used to the trade.\"\n\"Really? You don't say so?\"\n\"Yes. One of my friends is expatriating himself; I had been to see him off on board the Royal\nMail steamer, and was coming back here. I waited after that to see what Father Goriot would do; it is a\ncomical affair. He came back to this quarter of the world, to the Rue des Gres, and went into a\nmoney-lender's house; everybody knows him, Gobseck, a stuck-up rascal, that would make dominoes out\nof his father's bones, a Turk, a heathen, an old Jew, a Greek; it would be a difficult matter to rob _him_,\nfor he puts all his coin into the Bank.\"\n\"Then what was Father Goriot doing there?\"\n\"Doing?\" said Vautrin. \"Nothing; he was bent on his own undoing. He is a simpleton, stupid\nenough to ruin himself by running after----\"\n\"There he is!\" cried Sylvie.\n\"Christophe,\" cried Father Goriot's voice, \"come upstairs with me.\"\nChristophe went up, and shortly afterwards came down again.\n\"Where are you going?\" Mme. Vauquer asked of her servant.\n\"Out on an errand for M. Goriot.\"\n\n\"What may that be?\" said Vautrin, pouncing on a letter in Christophe's hand. \"_Mme. la\nComtesse Anastasie de Restaud_,\" he read. \"Where are you going with it?\" he added, as he gave the letter\nback to Christophe.\n\"To the Rue du Helder. I have orders to give this into her hands myself.\"\n\"What is there inside it?\" said Vautrin, holding the letter up to the light. \"A banknote? No.\" He\npeered into the envelope. \"A receipted account!\" he cried. \"My word! 'tis a gallant old dotard. Off with\nyou, old chap,\" he said, bringing down a hand on Christophe's head, and spinning the man round like a\nthimble; \"you will have a famous tip.\"\nBy this time the table was set. Sylvie was boiling the milk, Mme. Vauquer was lighting a fire in\nthe stove with some assistance from Vautrin, who kept humming to himself:\n\"The same old story everywhere, A roving heart and a roving glance.\"\nWhen everything was ready, Mme. Couture and Mlle. Taillefer came in.\n\"Where have you been this morning, fair lady?\" said Mme. Vauquer, turning to Mme. Couture.\n\"We have just been to say our prayers at Saint-Etienne du Mont. To-day is the day when we must\ngo to see M. Taillefer. Poor little thing! She is trembling like a leaf,\" Mme. Couture went on, as she\nseated herself before the fire and held the steaming soles of her boots to the blaze.\n\"Warm yourself, Victorine,\" said Mme. Vauquer.\n\"It is quite right and proper, mademoiselle, to pray to Heaven to soften your father's heart,\" said\nVautrin, as he drew a chair nearer to the orphan girl; \"but that is not enough. What you want is a friend\nwho will give the monster a piece of his mind; a barbarian that has three millions (so they say), and will\nnot give you a dowry; and a pretty girl needs a dowry nowadays.\"\n\"Poor child!\" said Mme. Vauquer. \"Never mind, my pet, your wretch of a father is going just the\nway to bring trouble upon himself.\"\nVictorine's eyes filled with tears at the words, and the widow checked herself at a sign from\nMme. Couture.\n\"If we could only see him!\" said the Commissary-General's widow; \"if I could speak to him\nmyself and give him his wife's last letter! I have never dared to run the risk of sending it by post; he knew\nmy handwriting----\"\n\"'Oh woman, persecuted and injured innocent!'\" exclaimed Vautrin, breaking in upon her. \"So\nthat is how you are, is it? In a few days' time I will look into your affairs, and it will be all right, you shall\nsee.\"\n\"Oh! sir,\" said Victorine, with a tearful but eager glance at Vautrin, who showed no sign of being\ntouched by it, \"if you know of any way of communicating with my father, please be sure and tell him that\nhis affection and my mother's honor are more to me than all the money in the world. If you can induce\nhim to relent a little towards me, I will pray to God for you. You may be sure of my gratitude----\"\n\n\"_The same old story everywhere_,\" sang Vautrin, with a satirical intonation. At this juncture,\nGoriot, Mlle. Michonneau, and Poiret came downstairs together; possibly the scent of the gravy which\nSylvie was making to serve with the mutton had announced breakfast. The seven people thus assembled\nbade each other good-morning, and took their places at the table; the clock struck ten, and the student's\nfootstep was heard outside.\n\"Ah! here you are, M. Eugene,\" said Sylvie; \"every one is breakfasting at home to-day.\"\nThe student exchanged greetings with the lodgers, and sat down beside Goriot.\n\"I have just met with a queer adventure,\" he said, as he helped himself abundantly to the mutton,\nand cut a slice of bread, which Mme. Vauquer's eyes gauged as usual.\n\"An adventure?\" queried Poiret.\n\"Well, and what is there to astonish you in that, old boy?\" Vautrin asked of Poiret. \"M. Eugene is\ncut out for that kind of thing.\"\nMlle. Taillefer stole a timid glance at the young student.\n\"Tell us about your adventure!\" demanded M. Vautrin.\n\"Yesterday evening I went to a ball given by a cousin of mine, the Vicomtesse de Beauseant. She\nhas a magnificent house; the rooms are hung with silk--in short, it was a splendid affair, and I was as\nhappy as a king---\"\n\"Fisher,\" put in Vautrin, interrupting.\n\"What do you mean, sir?\" said Eugene sharply.\n\"I said 'fisher,' because kingfishers see a good deal more fun than kings.\"\n\"Quite true; I would much rather be the little careless bird than a king,\" said Poiret the ditto-ist,\n\"because----\"\n\"In fact\"--the law-student cut him short--\"I danced with one of the handsomest women in the\nroom, a charming countess, the most exquisite creature I have ever seen. There was peach blossom in her\nhair, and she had the loveliest bouquet of flowers--real flowers, that scented the air----but there! it is no\nuse trying to describe a woman glowing with the dance. You ought to have seen her! Well, and this\nmorning I met this divine countess about nine o'clock, on foot in the Rue de Gres. Oh! how my heart beat!\nI began to think----\"\n\"That she was coming here,\" said Vautrin, with a keen look at the student. \"I expect that she was\ngoing to call on old Gobseck, a money-lender. If ever you explore a Parisian woman's heart, you will find\nthe money-lender first, and the lover afterwards. Your countess is called Anastasie de Restaud, and she\nlives in the Rue du Helder.\"\nThe student stared hard at Vautrin. Father Goriot raised his head at the words, and gave the two\nspeakers a glance so full of intelligence and uneasiness that the lodgers beheld him with astonishment.\n\n\"Then Christophe was too late, and she must have gone to him!\" cried Goriot, with anguish in his\nvoice.\n\"It is just as I guessed,\" said Vautrin, leaning over to whisper in Mme. Vauquer's ear.\nGoriot went on with his breakfast, but seemed unconscious of what he was doing. He had never\nlooked more stupid nor more taken up with his own thoughts than he did at that moment.\n\"Who the devil could have told you her name, M. Vautrin?\" asked Eugene.\n\"Aha! there you are!\" answered Vautrin. \"Old Father Goriot there knew it quite well! and why\nshould I not know it too?\"\n\"M. Goriot?\" the student cried.\n\"What is it?\" asked the old man. \"So she was very beautiful, was she, yesterday night?\"\n\"Who?\"\n\"Mme. de Restaud.\"\n\"Look at the old wretch,\" said Mme. Vauquer, speaking to Vautrin; \"how his eyes light up!\"\n\"Then does he really keep her?\" said Mlle. Michonneau, in a whisper to the student.\n\"Oh! yes, she was tremendously pretty,\" Eugene answered. Father Goriot watched him with eager\neyes. \"If Mme. de Beauseant had not been there, my divine countess would have been the queen of the\nball; none of the younger men had eyes for any one else. I was the twelfth on her list, and she danced\nevery quadrille. The other women were furious. She must have enjoyed herself, if ever creature did! It is a\ntrue saying that there is no more beautiful sight than a frigate in full sail, a galloping horse, or a woman\ndancing.\"\n\"So the wheel turns,\" said Vautrin; \"yesterday night at a duchess' ball, this morning in a\nmoney-lender's office, on the lowest rung of the ladder--just like a Parisienne! If their husbands cannot\nafford to pay for their frantic extravagance, they will sell themselves. Or if they cannot do that, they will\ntear out their mothers' hearts to find something to pay for their splendor. They will turn the world upside\ndown. Just a Parisienne through and through!\"\nFather Goriot's face, which had shone at the student's words like the sun on a bright day, clouded\nover all at once at this cruel speech of Vautrin's.\n\"Well,\" said Mme. Vauquer, \"but where is your adventure? Did you speak to her? Did you ask\nher if she wanted to study law?\"\n\"She did not see me,\" said Eugene. \"But only think of meeting one of the prettiest women in Paris\nin the Rue des Gres at nine o'clock! She could not have reached home after the ball till two o'clock this\nmorning. Wasn't it queer? There is no place like Paris for this sort of adventures.\"\n\"Pshaw! much funnier things than _that_ happen here!\" exclaimed Vautrin.\n\nMlle. Taillefer had scarcely heeded the talk, she was so absorbed by the thought of the new\nattempt that she was about to make. Mme. Couture made a sign that it was time to go upstairs and dress;\nthe two ladies went out, and Father Goriot followed their example.\n\"Well, did you see?\" said Mme. Vauquer, addressing Vautrin and the rest of the circle. \"He is\nruining himself for those women, that is plain.\"\n\"Nothing will ever make me believe that that beautiful Comtesse de Restaud is anything to Father\nGoriot,\" cried the student.\n\"Well, and if you don't,\" broke in Vautrin, \"we are not set on convincing you. You are too young\nto know Paris thoroughly yet; later on you will find out that there are what we call men with a\npassion----\"\nMlle. Michonneau gave Vautrin a quick glance at these words. They seemed to be like the sound\nof a trumpet to a trooper's horse. \"Aha!\" said Vautrin, stopping in his speech to give her a searching\nglance, \"so we have had our little experiences, have we?\"\nThe old maid lowered her eyes like a nun who sees a statue.\n\"Well,\" he went on, \"when folk of that kind get a notion into their heads, they cannot drop it.\nThey must drink the water from some particular spring--it is stagnant as often as not; but they will sell\ntheir wives and families, they will sell their own souls to the devil to get it. For some this spring is play,\nor the stock-exchange, or music, or a collection of pictures or insects; for others it is some woman who\ncan give them the dainties they like. You might offer these last all the women on earth--they would turn\nup their noses; they will have the only one who can gratify their passion. It often happens that the woman\ndoes not care for them at all, and treats them cruelly; they buy their morsels of satisfaction very dear; but\nno matter, the fools are never tired of it; they will take their last blanket to the pawnbroker's to give their\nlast five-franc piece to her. Father Goriot here is one of that sort. He is discreet, so the Countess exploits\nhim--just the way of the gay world. The poor old fellow thinks of her and of nothing else. In all other\nrespects you see he is a stupid animal; but get him on that subject, and his eyes sparkle like diamonds.\nThat secret is not difficult to guess. He took some plate himself this morning to the melting-pot, and I saw\nhim at Daddy Gobseck's in the Rue des Gres. And now, mark what follows--he came back here, and gave\na letter for the Comtesse de Restaud to that noodle of a Christophe, who showed us the address; there was\na receipted bill inside it. It is clear that it was an urgent matter if the Countess also went herself to the old\nmoney lender. Father Goriot has financed her handsomely. There is no need to tack a tale together; the\nthing is self-evident. So that shows you, sir student, that all the time your Countess was smiling, dancing,\nflirting, swaying her peach-flower crowned head, with her gown gathered into her hand, her slippers were\npinching her, as they say; she was thinking of her protested bills, or her lover's protested bills.\"\n\"You have made me wild to know the truth,\" cried Eugene; \"I will go to call on Mme. de Restaud\nto-morrow.\"\n\"Yes,\" echoed Poiret; \"you must go and call on Mme. de Restaud.\"\n\"And perhaps you will find Father Goriot there, who will take payment for the assistance he\npolitely rendered.\"\nEugene looked disgusted. \"Why, then, this Paris of yours is a slough.\"\n\n\"And an uncommonly queer slough, too,\" replied Vautrin. \"The mud splashes you as you drive\nthrough it in your carriage--you are a respectable person; you go afoot and are splashed--you are a\nscoundrel. You are so unlucky as to walk off with something or other belonging to somebody else, and\nthey exhibit you as a curiosity in the Place du Palais-de-Justice; you steal a million, and you are pointed\nout in every salon as a model of virtue. And you pay thirty millions for the police and the courts of\njustice, for the maintenance of law and order! A pretty slate of things it is!\"\n\"What,\" cried Mme. Vauquer, \"has Father Goriot really melted down his silver posset-dish?\"\n\"There were two turtle-doves on the lid, were there not?\" asked Eugene.\n\"Yes, that there were.\"\n\"Then, was he fond of it?\" said Eugene. \"He cried while he was breaking up the cup and plate. I\nhappened to see him by accident.\"\n\"It was dear to him as his own life,\" answered the widow.\n\"There! you see how infatuated the old fellow is!\" cried Vautrin. \"The woman yonder can coax\nthe soul out of him.\"\nThe student went up to his room. Vautrin went out, and a few moments later Mme. Couture and\nVictorine drove away in a cab which Sylvie had called for them. Poiret gave his arm to Mlle.\nMichonneau, and they went together to spend the two sunniest hours of the day in the Jardin des Plantes.\n\"Well, those two are as good as married,\" was the portly Sylvie's comment. \"They are going out\ntogether to-day for the first time. They are such a couple of dry sticks that if they happen to strike against\neach other they will draw sparks like flint and steel.\"\n\"Keep clear of Mlle. Michonneau's shawl, then,\" said Mme. Vauquer, laughing; \"it would flare up\nlike tinder.\"\nAt four o'clock that evening, when Goriot came in, he saw, by the light of two smoky lamps, that\nVictorine's eyes were red. Mme. Vauquer was listening to the history of the visit made that morning to M.\nTaillefer; it had been made in vain. Taillefer was tired of the annual application made by his daughter and\nher elderly friend; he gave them a personal interview in order to arrive at an understanding with them.\n\"My dear lady,\" said Mme. Couture, addressing Mme. Vauquer, \"just imagine it; he did not even\nask Victorine to sit down, she was standing the whole time. He said to me quite coolly, without putting\nhimself in a passion, that we might spare ourselves the trouble of going there; that the young lady (he\nwould not call her his daughter) was injuring her cause by importuning him (_importuning!_ once a year,\nthe wretch!); that as Victorine's mother had nothing when he married her, Victorine ought not to expect\nanything from him; in fact, he said the most cruel things, that made the poor child burst out crying. The\nlittle thing threw herself at her father's feet and spoke up bravely; she said that she only persevered in her\nvisits for her mother's sake; that she would obey him without a murmur, but that she begged him to read\nher poor dead mother's farewell letter. She took it up and gave it to him, saying the most beautiful things\nin the world, most beautifully expressed; I do not know where she learned them; God must have put them\ninto her head, for the poor child was inspired to speak so nicely that it made me cry like a fool to hear her\ntalk. And what do you think the monster was doing all the time? Cutting his nails! He took the letter that\n\npoor Mme. Taillefer had soaked with tears, and flung it on to the chimney-piece. 'That is all right,' he\nsaid. He held out his hands to raise his daughter, but she covered them with kisses, and he drew them\naway again. Scandalous, isn't it? And his great booby of a son came in and took no notice of his sister.\"\n\"What inhuman wretches they must be!\" said Father Goriot.\n\"And then they both went out of the room,\" Mme. Couture went on, without heeding the worthy\nvermicelli maker's exclamation; \"father and son bowed to me, and asked me to excuse them on account of\nurgent business! That is the history of our call. Well, he has seen his daughter at any rate. How he can\nrefuse to acknowledge her I cannot think, for they are as alike as two peas.\"\nThe boarders dropped in one after another, interchanging greetings and empty jokes that certain\nclasses of Parisians regard as humorous and witty. Dulness is their prevailing ingredient, and the whole\npoint consists in mispronouncing a word or a gesture. This kind of argot is always changing. The essence\nof the jest consists in some catchword suggested by a political event, an incident in the police courts, a\nstreet song, or a bit of burlesque at some theatre, and forgotten in a month. Anything and everything\nserves to keep up a game of battledore and shuttlecock with words and ideas. The diorama, a recent\ninvention, which carried an optical illusion a degree further than panoramas, had given rise to a mania\namong art students for ending every word with _rama_. The Maison Vauquer had caught the infection\nfrom a young artist among the boarders.\n\"Well, Monsieur-r-r Poiret,\" said the _employe_ from the Museum, \"how is your health-orama?\"\nThen, without waiting for an answer, he turned to Mme. Couture and Victorine with a \"Ladies, you seem\nmelancholy.\"\n\"Is dinner ready?\" cried Horace Bianchon, a medical student, and a friend of Rastignac's; \"my\nstomach is sinking _usque ad talones_.\"\n\"There is an uncommon _frozerama_ outside,\" said Vautrin. \"Make room there, Father Goriot!\nConfound it, your foot covers the whole front of the stove.\"\n\"Illustrious M. Vautrin,\" put in Bianchon, \"why do you say _frozerama_? It is incorrect; it should\nbe _frozenrama_.\"\n\"No, it shouldn't,\" said the official from the Museum; \"_frozerama_ is right by the same rule that\nyou say 'My feet are _froze_.'\"\n\"Ah! ah!\"\n\"Here is his Excellency the Marquis de Rastignac, Doctor of the Law of Contraries,\" cried\nBianchon, seizing Eugene by the throat, and almost throttling him.\n\"Hallo there! hallo!\"\nMlle. Michonneau came noiselessly in, bowed to the rest of the party, and took her place beside\nthe three women without saying a word.\n\"That old bat always makes me shudder,\" said Bianchon in a low voice, indicating Mlle.\nMichonneau to Vautrin. \"I have studied Gall's system, and I am sure she has the bump of Judas.\"\n\n\"Then you have seen a case before?\" said Vautrin.\n\"Who has not?\" answered Bianchon. \"Upon my word, that ghastly old maid looks just like one of\nthe long worms that will gnaw a beam through, give them time enough.\"\n\"That is the way, young man,\" returned he of the forty years and the dyed whiskers:\n\"The rose has lived the life of a rose-- A morning's space.\"\n\"Aha! here is a magnificent _soupe-au-rama_,\" cried Poiret as Christophe came in bearing the\nsoup with cautious heed.\n\"I beg your pardon, sir,\" said Mme. Vauquer; \"it is _soupe aux choux_.\"\nAll the young men roared with laughter.\n\"Had you there, Poiret!\"\n\"Poir-r-r-rette! she had you there!\"\n\"Score two points to Mamma Vauquer,\" said Vautrin.\n\"Did any of you notice the fog this morning?\" asked the official.\n\"It was a frantic fog,\" said Bianchon, \"a fog unparalleled, doleful, melancholy, sea-green,\nasthmatical--a Goriot of a fog!\"\n\"A Goriorama,\" said the art student, \"because you couldn't see a thing in it.\"\n\"Hey! Milord Gaoriotte, they air talking about yoo-o-ou!\"\nFather Goriot, seated at the lower end of the table, close to the door through which the servant\nentered, raised his face; he had smelt at a scrap of bread that lay under his table napkin, an old trick\nacquired in his commercial capacity, that still showed itself at times.\n\"Well,\" Madame Vauquer cried in sharp tones, that rang above the rattle of spoons and plates and\nthe sound of other voices, \"and is there anything the matter with the bread?\"\n\"Nothing whatever, madame,\" he answered; \"on the contrary, it is made of the best quality of\ncorn; flour from Etampes.\"\n\"How could you tell?\" asked Eugene.\n\"By the color, by the flavor.\"\n\"You knew the flavor by the smell, I suppose,\" said Mme. Vauquer. \"You have grown so\neconomical, you will find out how to live on the smell of cooking at last.\"\n\"Take out a patent for it, then,\" cried the Museum official; \"you would make a handsome\n\nfortune.\"\n\"Never mind him,\" said the artist; \"he does that sort of thing to delude us into thinking that he\nwas a vermicelli maker.\"\n\"Your nose is a corn-sampler, it appears?\" inquired the official.\n\"Corn _what_?\" asked Bianchon.\n\"Corn-el.\"\n\"Corn-et.\"\n\"Corn-elian.\"\n\"Corn-ice.\"\n\"Corn-ucopia.\"\n\"Corn-crake.\"\n\"Corn-cockle.\"\n\"Corn-orama.\"\nThe eight responses came like a rolling fire from every part of the room, and the laughter that\nfollowed was the more uproarious because poor Father Goriot stared at the others with a puzzled look,\nlike a foreigner trying to catch the meaning of words in a language which he does not understand.\n\"Corn? . . .\" he said, turning to Vautrin, his next neighbor.\n\"Corn on your foot, old man!\" said Vautrin, and he drove Father Goriot's cap down over his eyes\nby a blow on the crown.\nThe poor old man thus suddenly attacked was for a moment too bewildered to do anything.\nChristophe carried off his plate, thinking that he had finished his soup, so that when Goriot had pushed\nback his cap from his eyes his spoon encountered the table. Every one burst out laughing. \"You are a\ndisagreeable joker, sir,\" said the old man, \"and if you take any further liberties with me----\"\n\"Well, what then, old boy?\" Vautrin interrupted.\n\"Well, then, you shall pay dearly for it some day----\"\n\"Down below, eh?\" said the artist, \"in the little dark corner where they put naughty boys.\"\n\"Well, mademoiselle,\" Vautrin said, turning to Victorine, \"you are eating nothing. So papa was\nrefractory, was he?\"\n\"A monster!\" said Mme. Couture.\n\n\"Mademoiselle might make application for aliment pending her suit; she is not eating anything.\nEh! eh! just see how Father Goriot is staring at Mlle. Victorine.\"\nThe old man had forgotten his dinner, he was so absorbed in gazing at the poor girl; the sorrow in\nher face was unmistakable,--the slighted love of a child whose father would not recognize her.\n\"We are mistaken about Father Goriot, my dear boy,\" said Eugene in a low voice. \"He is not an\nidiot, nor wanting in energy. Try your Gall system on him, and let me know what you think. I saw him\ncrush a silver dish last night as if it had been made of wax; there seems to be something extraordinary\ngoing on in his mind just now, to judge by his face. His life is so mysterious that it must be worth\nstudying. Oh! you may laugh, Bianchon; I am not joking.\"\n\"The man is a subject, is he?\" said Bianchon; \"all right! I will dissect him, if he will give me the\nchance.\"\n\"No; feel his bumps.\"\n\"Hm!--his stupidity might perhaps be contagious.\"\nThe next day Rastignac dressed himself very elegantly, and about three o'clock in the afternoon\nwent to call on Mme. de Restaud. On the way thither he indulged in the wild intoxicating dreams which\nfill a young head so full of delicious excitement. Young men at his age take no account of obstacles nor of\ndangers; they see success in every direction; imagination has free play, and turns their lives into a\nromance; they are saddened or discouraged by the collapse of one of the visionary schemes that have no\nexistence save in their heated fancy. If youth were not ignorant and timid, civilization would be\nimpossible.\nEugene took unheard-of pains to keep himself in a spotless condition, but on his way through the\nstreets he began to think about Mme. de Restaud and what he should say to her. He equipped himself with\nwit, rehearsed repartees in the course of an imaginary conversation, and prepared certain neat speeches a\nla Talleyrand, conjuring up a series of small events which should prepare the way for the declaration on\nwhich he had based his future; and during these musings the law student was bespattered with mud, and\nby the time he reached the Palais Royal he was obliged to have his boots blacked and his trousers\nbrushed.\n\"If I were rich,\" he said, as he changed the five-franc piece he had brought with him in case\nanything might happen, \"I would take a cab, then I could think at my ease.\"\nAt last he reached the Rue du Helder, and asked for the Comtesse de Restaud. He bore the\ncontemptuous glances of the servants, who had seen him cross the court on foot, with the cold fury of a\nman who knows that he will succeed some day. He understood the meaning of their glances at once, for\nhe had felt his inferiority as soon as he entered the court, where a smart cab was waiting. All the delights\nof life in Paris seemed to be implied by this visible and manifest sign of luxury and extravagance. A fine\nhorse, in magnificent harness, was pawing the ground, and all at once the law student felt out of humor\nwith himself. Every compartment in his brain which he had thought to find so full of wit was bolted fast;\nhe grew positively stupid. He sent up his name to the Countess, and waited in the ante-chamber, standing\non one foot before a window that looked out upon the court; mechanically he leaned his elbow against the\n\nsash, and stared before him. The time seemed long; he would have left the house but for the southern\ntenacity of purpose which works miracles when it is single-minded.\n\"Madame is in her boudoir, and cannot see any one at present, sir,\" said the servant. \"She gave me\nno answer; but if you will go into the dining-room, there is some one already there.\"\nRastignac was impressed with a sense of the formidable power of the lackey who can accuse or\ncondemn his masters by a word; he coolly opened the door by which the man had just entered the\nante-chamber, meaning, no doubt, to show these insolent flunkeys that he was familiar with the house; but\nhe found that he had thoughtlessly precipitated himself into a small room full of dressers, where lamps\nwere standing, and hot-water pipes, on which towels were being dried; a dark passage and a back\nstaircase lay beyond it. Stifled laughter from the ante-chamber added to his confusion.\n\"This way to the drawing-room, sir,\" said the servant, with the exaggerated respect which seemed\nto be one more jest at his expense.\nEugene turned so quickly that he stumbled against a bath. By good luck, he managed to keep his\nhat on his head, and saved it from immersion in the water; but just as he turned, a door opened at the\nfurther end of the dark passage, dimly lighted by a small lamp. Rastignac heard voices and the sound of a\nkiss; one of the speakers was Mme. de Restaud, the other was Father Goriot. Eugene followed the servant\nthrough the dining-room into the drawing-room; he went to a window that looked out into the courtyard,\nand stood there for a while. He meant to know whether this Goriot was really the Goriot that he knew. His\nheart beat unwontedly fast; he remembered Vautrin's hideous insinuations. A well-dressed young man\nsuddenly emerged from the room almost as Eugene entered it, saying impatiently to the servant who stood\nat the door: \"I am going, Maurice. Tell Madame la Comtesse that I waited more than half an hour for her.\"\nWhereupon this insolent being, who, doubtless, had a right to be insolent, sang an Italian trill, and\nwent towards the window where Eugene was standing, moved thereto quite as much by a desire to see the\nstudent's face as by a wish to look out into the courtyard.\n\"But M. le Comte had better wait a moment longer; madame is disengaged,\" said Maurice, as he\nreturned to the ante-chamber.\nJust at that moment Father Goriot appeared close to the gate; he had emerged from a door at the\nfoot of the back staircase. The worthy soul was preparing to open his umbrella regardless of the fact that\nthe great gate had opened to admit a tilbury, in which a young man with a ribbon at his button-hole was\nseated. Father Goriot had scarcely time to start back and save himself. The horse took fright at the\numbrella, swerved, and dashed forward towards the flight of steps. The young man looked round in\nannoyance, saw Father Goriot, and greeted him as he went out with constrained courtesy, such as people\nusually show to a money-lender so long as they require his services, or the sort of respect they feel it\nnecessary to show for some one whose reputation has been blown upon, so that they blush to\nacknowledge his acquaintance. Father Goriot gave him a little friendly nod and a good-natured smile. All\nthis happened with lightning speed. Eugene was so deeply interested that he forgot that he was not alone\ntill he suddenly heard the Countess' voice.\n\"Oh! Maxime, were you going away?\" she said reproachfully, with a shade of pique in her\nmanner. The Countess had not seen the incident nor the entrance of the tilbury. Rastignac turned abruptly\nand saw her standing before him, coquettishly dressed in a loose white cashmere gown with knots of\nrose-colored ribbon here and there; her hair was carelessly coiled about her head, as is the wont of\n\nParisian women in the morning; there was a soft fragrance about her--doubtless she was fresh from a\nbath;--her graceful form seemed more flexible, her beauty more luxuriant. Her eyes glistened. A young\nman can see everything at a glance; he feels the radiant influence of woman as a plant discerns and\nabsorbs its nutriment from the air; he did not need to touch her hands to feel their cool freshness. He saw\nfaint rose tints through the cashmere of the dressing gown; it had fallen slightly open, giving glimpses of\na bare throat, on which the student's eyes rested. The Countess had no need of the adventitious aid of\ncorsets; her girdle defined the outlines of her slender waist; her throat was a challenge to love; her feet,\nthrust into slippers, were daintily small. As Maxime took her hand and kissed it, Eugene became aware of\nMaxime's existence, and the Countess saw Eugene.\n\"Oh! is that you M. de Rastignac? I am very glad to see you,\" she said, but there was something\nin her manner that a shrewd observer would have taken as a hint to depart.\nMaxime, as the Countess Anastasie had called the young man with the haughty insolence of\nbearing, looked from Eugene to the lady, and from the lady to Eugene; it was sufficiently evident that he\nwished to be rid of the latter. An exact and faithful rendering of the glance might be given in the words:\n\"Look here, my dear; I hope you intend to send this little whipper-snapper about his business.\"\nThe Countess consulted the young man's face with an intent submissiveness that betrays all the\nsecrets of a woman's heart, and Rastignac all at once began to hate him violently. To begin with, the sight\nof the fair carefully arranged curls on the other's comely head had convinced him that his own crop was\nhideous; Maxime's boots, moreover, were elegant and spotless, while his own, in spite of all his care, bore\nsome traces of his recent walk; and, finally, Maxime's overcoat fitted the outline of his figure gracefully,\nhe looked like a pretty woman, while Eugene was wearing a black coat at half-past two. The quick-witted\nchild of the Charente felt the disadvantage at which he was placed beside this tall, slender dandy, with the\nclear gaze and the pale face, one of those men who would ruin orphan children without scruple. Mme. de\nRestaud fled into the next room without waiting for Eugene to speak; shaking out the skirts of her\ndressing-gown in her flight, so that she looked like a white butterfly, and Maxime hurried after her.\nEugene, in a fury, followed Maxime and the Countess, and the three stood once more face to face by the\nhearth in the large drawing-room. The law student felt quite sure that the odious Maxime found him in the\nway, and even at the risk of displeasing Mme. de Restaud, he meant to annoy the dandy. It had struck him\nall at once that he had seen the young man before at Mme. de Beauseant's ball; he guessed the relation\nbetween Maxime and Mme. de Restaud; and with the youthful audacity that commits prodigious blunders\nor achieves signal success, he said to himself, \"This is my rival; I mean to cut him out.\"\nRash resolve! He did not know that M. le Comte Maxime de Trailles would wait till he was\ninsulted, so as to fire first and kill his man. Eugene was a sportsman and a good shot, but he had not yet\nhit the bulls's eye twenty times out of twenty-two. The young Count dropped into a low chair by the\nhearth, took up the tongs, and made up the fire so violently and so sulkily, that Anastasie's fair face\nsuddenly clouded over. She turned to Eugene, with a cool, questioning glance that asked plainly, \"Why\ndo you not go?\" a glance which well-bred people regard as a cue to make their exit.\nEugene assumed an amiable expression.\n\"Madame,\" he began, \"I hastened to call upon you----\"\nHe stopped short. The door opened, and the owner of the tilbury suddenly appeared. He had left\nhis hat outside, and did not greet the Countess; he looked meditatively at Rastignac, and held out his hand\nto Maxime with a cordial \"Good morning,\" that astonished Eugene not a little. The young provincial did\n\nnot understand the amenities of a triple alliance.\n\"M. de Restaud,\" said the Countess, introducing her husband to the law student.\nEugene bowed profoundly.\n\"This gentleman,\" she continued, presenting Eugene to her husband, \"is M. de Rastignac; he is\nrelated to Mme. la Vicomtesse de Beauseant through the Marcillacs; I had the pleasure of meeting him at\nher last ball.\"\n_Related to Mme. la Vicomtesse de Beauseant through the Marcillacs!_ These words, on which\nthe countess threw ever so slight an emphasis, by reason of the pride that the mistress of a house takes in\nshowing that she only receives people of distinction as visitors in her house, produced a magical effect.\nThe Count's stiff manner relaxed at once as he returned the student's bow.\n\"Delighted to have an opportunity of making your acquaintance,\" he said.\nMaxime de Trailles himself gave Eugene an uneasy glance, and suddenly dropped his insolent\nmanner. The mighty name had all the power of a fairy's wand; those closed compartments in the southern\nbrain flew open again; Rastignac's carefully drilled faculties returned. It was as if a sudden light had\npierced the obscurity of this upper world of Paris, and he began to see, though everything was indistinct\nas yet. Mme. Vauquer's lodging-house and Father Goriot were very far remote from his thoughts.\n\"I thought that the Marcillacs were extinct,\" the Comte de Restaud said, addressing Eugene.\n\"Yes, they are extinct,\" answered the law student. \"My great-uncle, the Chevalier de Rastignac,\nmarried the heiress of the Marcillac family. They had only one daughter, who married the Marechal de\nClarimbault, Mme. de Beauseant's grandfather on the mother's side. We are the younger branch of the\nfamily, and the younger branch is all the poorer because my great-uncle, the Vice-Admiral, lost all that he\nhad in the King's service. The Government during the Revolution refused to admit our claims when the\nCompagnie des Indes was liquidated.\"\n\"Was not your great-uncle in command of the _Vengeur_ before 1789?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"Then he would be acquainted with my grandfather, who commanded the _Warwick_.\"\nMaxime looked at Mme. de Restaud and shrugged his shoulders, as who should say, \"If he is\ngoing to discuss nautical matters with that fellow, it is all over with us.\" Anastasie understood the glance\nthat M. de Trailles gave her. With a woman's admirable tact, she began to smile and said:\n\"Come with me, Maxime; I have something to say to you. We will leave you two gentlemen to\nsail in company on board the _Warwick_ and the _Vengeur_.\"\nShe rose to her feet and signed to Maxime to follow her, mirth and mischief in her whole attitude,\nand the two went in the direction of the boudoir. The _morganatic_ couple (to use a convenient German\nexpression which has no exact equivalent) had reached the door, when the Count interrupted himself in\nhis talk with Eugene.\n\n\"Anastasie!\" he cried pettishly, \"just stay a moment, dear; you know very well that----\"\n\"I am coming back in a minute,\" she interrupted; \"I have a commission for Maxime to execute,\nand I want to tell him about it.\"\nShe came back almost immediately. She had noticed the inflection in her husband's voice, and\nknew that it would not be safe to retire to the boudoir; like all women who are compelled to study their\nhusbands' characters in order to have their own way, and whose business it is to know exactly how far\nthey can go without endangering a good understanding, she was very careful to avoid petty collisions in\ndomestic life. It was Eugene who had brought about this untoward incident; so the Countess looked at\nMaxime and indicated the law student with an air of exasperation. M. de Trailles addressed the Count, the\nCountess, and Eugene with the pointed remark, \"You are busy, I do not want to interrupt you; good-day,\"\nand he went.\n\"Just wait a moment, Maxime!\" the Count called after him.\n\"Come and dine with us,\" said the Countess, leaving Eugene and her husband together once more.\nShe followed Maxime into the little drawing-room, where they sat together sufficiently long to feel sure\nthat Rastignac had taken his leave.\nThe law student heard their laughter, and their voices, and the pauses in their talk; he grew\nmalicious, exerted his conversational powers for M. de Restaud, flattered him, and drew him into\ndiscussions, to the end that he might see the Countess again and discover the nature of her relations with\nFather Goriot. This Countess with a husband and a lover, for Maxime clearly was her lover, was a\nmystery. What was the secret tie that bound her to the old tradesman? This mystery he meant to penetrate,\nhoping by its means to gain a sovereign ascendency over this fair typical Parisian.\n\"Anastasie!\" the Count called again to his wife.\n\"Poor Maxime!\" she said, addressing the young man. \"Come, we must resign ourselves. This\nevening----\"\n\"I hope, Nasie,\" he said in her ear, \"that you will give orders not to admit that youngster, whose\neyes light up like live coals when he looks at you. He will make you a declaration, and compromise you,\nand then you will compel me to kill him.\"\n\"Are you mad, Maxime?\" she said. \"A young lad of a student is, on the contrary, a capital\nlightning-conductor; is not that so? Of course, I mean to make Restaud furiously jealous of him.\"\nMaxime burst out laughing, and went out, followed by the Countess, who stood at the window to\nwatch him into his carriage; he shook his whip, and made his horse prance. She only returned when the\ngreat gate had been closed after him.\n\"What do you think, dear?\" cried the Count, her husband, \"this gentleman's family estate is not\nfar from Verteuil, on the Charente; his great-uncle and my grandfather were acquainted.\"\n\"Delighted to find that we have acquaintances in common,\" said the Countess, with a preoccupied\nmanner.\n\n\"More than you think,\" said Eugene, in a low voice.\n\"What do you mean?\" she asked quickly.\n\"Why, only just now,\" said the student, \"I saw a gentleman go out at the gate, Father Goriot, my\nnext door neighbor in the house where I am lodging.\"\nAt the sound of this name, and the prefix that embellished it, the Count, who was stirring the fire,\nlet the tongs fall as though they had burned his fingers, and rose to his feet.\n\"Sir,\" he cried, \"you might have called him 'Monsieur Goriot'!\"\nThe Countess turned pale at first at the sight of her husband's vexation, then she reddened; clearly\nshe was embarrassed, her answer was made in a tone that she tried to make natural, and with an air of\nassumed carelessness:\n\"You could not know any one who is dearer to us both . . .\"\nShe broke off, glanced at the piano as if some fancy had crossed her mind, and asked, \"Are you\nfond of music, M. de Rastignac?\"\n\"Exceedingly,\" answered Eugene, flushing, and disconcerted by a dim suspicion that he had\nsomehow been guilty of a clumsy piece of folly.\n\"Do you sing?\" she cried, going to the piano, and, sitting down before it, she swept her fingers\nover the keyboard from end to end. R-r-r-rah!\n\"No, madame.\"\nThe Comte de Restaud walked to and fro.\n\"That is a pity; you are without one great means of success. --_Ca-ro, ca-a-ro, ca-a-a-ro, non\ndu-bi-ta-re_,\" sang the Countess.\nEugene had a second time waved a magic wand when he uttered Goriot's name, but the effect\nseemed to be entirely opposite to that produced by the formula \"related to Mme. de Beauseant.\" His\nposition was not unlike that of some visitor permitted as a favor to inspect a private collection of\ncuriosities, when by inadvertence he comes into collision with a glass case full of sculptured figures, and\nthree or four heads, imperfectly secured, fall at the shock. He wished the earth would open and swallow\nhim. Mme. de Restaud's expression was reserved and chilly, her eyes had grown indifferent, and\nsedulously avoided meeting those of the unlucky student of law.\n\"Madame,\" he said, \"you wish to talk with M. de Restaud; permit me to wish you good-day----\"\nThe Countess interrupted him by a gesture, saying hastily, \"Whenever you come to see us, both\nM. de Restaud and I shall be delighted to see you.\"\nEugene made a profound bow and took his leave, followed by M. de Restaud, who insisted, in\nspite of his remonstrances, on accompanying him into the hall.\n\n\"Neither your mistress nor I are at home to that gentleman when he calls,\" the Count said to\nMaurice.\nAs Eugene set foot on the steps, he saw that it was raining.\n\"Come,\" said he to himself, \"somehow I have just made a mess of it, I do not know how. And\nnow I am going to spoil my hat and coat into the bargain. I ought to stop in my corner, grind away at law,\nand never look to be anything but a boorish country magistrate. How can I go into society, when to\nmanage properly you want a lot of cabs, varnished boots, gold watch chains, and all sorts of things; you\nhave to wear white doeskin gloves that cost six francs in the morning, and primrose kid gloves every\nevening? A fig for that old humbug of a Goriot!\"\nWhen he reached the street door, the driver of a hackney coach, who had probably just deposited\na wedding party at their door, and asked nothing better than a chance of making a little money for himself\nwithout his employer's knowledge, saw that Eugene had no umbrella, remarked his black coat, white\nwaistcoat, yellow gloves, and varnished boots, and stopped and looked at him inquiringly. Eugene, in the\nblind desperation that drives a young man to plunge deeper and deeper into an abyss, as if he might hope\nto find a fortunate issue in its lowest depths, nodded in reply to the driver's signal, and stepped into the\ncab; a few stray petals of orange blossom and scraps of wire bore witness to its recent occupation by a\nwedding party.\n\"Where am I to drive, sir?\" demanded the man, who, by this time, had taken off his white gloves.\n\"Confound it!\" Eugene said to himself, \"I am in for it now, and at least I will not spend cab-hire\nfor nothing!--Drive to the Hotel Beauseant,\" he said aloud.\n\"Which?\" asked the man, a portentous word that reduced Eugene to confusion. This young man\nof fashion, species incerta, did not know that there were two Hotels Beauseant; he was not aware how rich\nhe was in relations who did not care about him.\n\"The Vicomte de Beauseant, Rue----\"\n\"De Grenelle,\" interrupted the driver, with a jerk of his head. \"You see, there are the hotels of the\nMarquis and Comte de Beauseant in the Rue Saint-Dominique,\" he added, drawing up the step.\n\"I know all about that,\" said Eugene, severely.--\"Everybody is laughing at me to-day, it seems!\"\nhe said to himself, as he deposited his hat on the opposite seat. \"This escapade will cost me a king's\nransom, but, at any rate, I shall call on my so-called cousin in a thoroughly aristocratic fashion. Goriot has\ncost me ten francs already, the old scoundrel. My word! I will tell Mme. de Beauseant about my\nadventure; perhaps it may amuse her. Doubtless she will know the secret of the criminal relation between\nthat handsome woman and the old rat without a tail. It would be better to find favor in my cousin's eyes\nthan to come in contact with that shameless woman, who seems to me to have very expensive tastes.\nSurely the beautiful Vicomtesse's personal interest would turn the scale for me, when the mere mention of\nher name produces such an effect. Let us look higher. If you set yourself to carry the heights of heaven,\nyou must face God.\"\nThe innumerable thoughts that surged through his brain might be summed up in these phrases. He\ngrew calmer, and recovered something of his assurance as he watched the falling rain. He told himself\nthat though he was about to squander two of the precious five-franc pieces that remained to him, the\n\nmoney was well laid out in preserving his coat, boots, and hat; and his cabman's cry of \"Gate, if you\nplease,\" almost put him in spirits. A Swiss, in scarlet and gold, appeared, the great door groaned on its\nhinges, and Rastignac, with sweet satisfaction, beheld his equipage pass under the archway and stop\nbefore the flight of steps beneath the awning. The driver, in a blue-and-red greatcoat, dismounted and let\ndown the step. As Eugene stepped out of the cab, he heard smothered laughter from the peristyle. Three\nor four lackeys were making merry over the festal appearance of the vehicle. In another moment the law\nstudent was enlightened as to the cause of their hilarity; he felt the full force of the contrast between his\nequipage and one of the smartest broughams in Paris; a coachman, with powdered hair, seemed to find it\ndifficult to hold a pair of spirited horses, who stood chafing the bit. In Mme. de Restaud's courtyard, in\nthe Chaussee d'Antin, he had seen the neat turnout of a young man of six-and-twenty; in the Faubourg\nSaint-Germain he found the luxurious equipage of a man of rank; thirty thousand francs would not have\npurchased it.\n\"Who can be here?\" said Eugene to himself. He began to understand, though somewhat tardily,\nthat he must not expect to find many women in Paris who were not already appropriated, and that the\ncapture of one of these queens would be likely to cost something more than bloodshed. \"Confound it all! I\nexpect my cousin also has her Maxime.\"\nHe went up the steps, feeling that he was a blighted being. The glass door was opened for him;\nthe servants were as solemn as jackasses under the curry comb. So far, Eugene had only been in the\nballroom on the ground floor of the Hotel Beauseant; the fete had followed so closely on the invitation,\nthat he had not had time to call on his cousin, and had therefore never seen Mme. de Beauseant's\napartments; he was about to behold for the first time a great lady among the wonderful and elegant\nsurroundings that reveal her character and reflect her daily life. He was the more curious, because Mme.\nde Restaud's drawing-room had provided him with a standard of comparison.\nAt half-past four the Vicomtesse de Beauseant was visible. Five minutes earlier she would not\nhave received her cousin, but Eugene knew nothing of the recognized routine of various houses in Paris.\nHe was conducted up the wide, white-painted, crimson-carpeted staircase, between the gilded balusters\nand masses of flowering plants, to Mme. de Beauseant's apartments. He did not know the rumor current\nabout Mme. de Beauseant, one of the biographies told, with variations, in whispers, every evening in the\nsalons of Paris.\nFor three years past her name had been spoken of in connection with that of one of the most\nwealthy and distinguished Portuguese nobles, the Marquis d'Ajuda-Pinto. It was one of those innocent\n_liaisons_ which possess so much charm for the two thus attached to each other that they find the\npresence of a third person intolerable. The Vicomte de Beauseant, therefore, had himself set an example\nto the rest of the world by respecting, with as good a grace as might be, this morganatic union. Any one\nwho came to call on the Vicomtesse in the early days of this friendship was sure to find the Marquis\nd'Ajuda-Pinto there. As, under the circumstances, Mme. de Beauseant could not very well shut her door\nagainst these visitors, she gave them such a cold reception, and showed so much interest in the study of\nthe ceiling, that no one could fail to understand how much he bored her; and when it became known in\nParis that Mme. de Beauseant was bored by callers between two and four o'clock, she was left in perfect\nsolitude during that interval. She went to the Bouffons or to the Opera with M. de Beauseant and M.\nd'Ajuda-Pinto; and M. de Beauseant, like a well-bred man of the world, always left his wife and the\nPortuguese as soon as he had installed them. But M. d'Ajuda-Pinto must marry, and a Mlle. de Rochefide\nwas the young lady. In the whole fashionable world there was but one person who as yet knew nothing of\nthe arrangement, and that was Mme. de Beauseant. Some of her friends had hinted at the possibility, and\nshe had laughed at them, believing that envy had prompted those ladies to try to make mischief. And now,\n\nthough the bans were about to be published, and although the handsome Portuguese had come that day to\nbreak the news to the Vicomtesse, he had not found courage as yet to say one word about his treachery.\nHow was it? Nothing is doubtless more difficult than the notification of an ultimatum of this kind. There\nare men who feel more at their ease when they stand up before another man who threatens their lives with\nsword or pistol than in the presence of a woman who, after two hours of lamentations and reproaches,\nfalls into a dead swoon and requires salts. At this moment, therefore, M. d'Ajuda-Pinto was on thorns, and\nanxious to take his leave. He told himself that in some way or other the news would reach Mme. de\nBeauseant; he would write, it would be much better to do it by letter, and not to utter the words that\nshould stab her to the heart.\nSo when the servant announced M. Eugene de Rastignac, the Marquis d'Ajuda-Pinto trembled\nwith joy. To be sure, a loving woman shows even more ingenuity in inventing doubts of her lover than in\nvarying the monotony of his happiness; and when she is about to be forsaken, she instinctively interprets\nevery gesture as rapidly as Virgil's courser detected the presence of his companion by snuffing the breeze.\nIt was impossible, therefore, that Mme. de Beauseant should not detect that involuntary thrill of\nsatisfaction; slight though it was, it was appalling in its artlessness.\nEugene had yet to learn that no one in Paris should present himself in any house without first\nmaking himself acquainted with the whole history of its owner, and of its owner's wife and family, so that\nhe may avoid making any of the terrible blunders which in Poland draw forth the picturesque\nexclamation, \"Harness five bullocks to your cart!\" probably because you will need them all to pull you\nout of the quagmire into which a false step has plunged you. If, down to the present day, our language has\nno name for these conversational disasters, it is probably because they are believed to be impossible, the\npublicity given in Paris to every scandal is so prodigious. After the awkward incident at Mme. de\nRestaud's, no one but Eugene could have reappeared in his character of bullock-driver in Mme. de\nBeauseant's drawing-room. But if Mme. de Restaud and M. de Trailles had found him horribly in the way,\nM. d'Ajuda hailed his coming with relief.\n\"Good-bye,\" said the Portuguese, hurrying to the door, as Eugene made his entrance into a dainty\nlittle pink-and-gray drawing-room, where luxury seemed nothing more than good taste.\n\"Until this evening,\" said Mme. de Beauseant, turning her head to give the Marquis a glance. \"We\nare going to the Bouffons, are we not?\"\n\"I cannot go,\" he said, with his fingers on the door handle.\nMme. de Beauseant rose and beckoned to him to return. She did not pay the slightest attention to\nEugene, who stood there dazzled by the sparkling marvels around him; he began to think that this was\nsome story out of the Arabian Nights made real, and did not know where to hide himself, when the\nwoman before him seemed to be unconscious of his existence. The Vicomtesse had raised the forefinger\nof her right hand, and gracefully signed to the Marquis to seat himself beside her. The Marquis felt the\nimperious sway of passion in her gesture; he came back towards her. Eugene watched him, not without a\nfeeling of envy.\n\"That is the owner of the brougham!\" he said to himself. \"But is it necessary to have a pair of\nspirited horses, servants in livery, and torrents of gold to draw a glance from a woman here in Paris?\"\nThe demon of luxury gnawed at his heart, greed burned in his veins, his throat was parched with\nthe thirst of gold.\n\nHe had a hundred and thirty francs every quarter. His father, mother, brothers, sisters, and aunt\ndid not spend two hundred francs a month among them. This swift comparison between his present\ncondition and the aims he had in view helped to benumb his faculties.\n\"Why not?\" the Vicomtesse was saying, as she smiled at the Portuguese. \"Why cannot you come\nto the Italiens?\"\n\"Affairs! I am to dine with the English Ambassador.\"\n\"Throw him over.\"\nWhen a man once enters on a course of deception, he is compelled to add lie to lie. M. d'Ajuda\ntherefore said, smiling, \"Do you lay your commands on me?\"\n\"Yes, certainly.\"\n\"That was what I wanted to have you say to me,\" he answered, dissembling his feelings in a\nglance which would have reassured any other woman.\nHe took the Vicomtesse's hand, kissed it, and went.\nEugene ran his fingers through his hair, and constrained himself to bow. He thought that now\nMme. de Beauseant would give him her attention; but suddenly she sprang forward, rushed to a window\nin the gallery, and watched M. d'Ajuda step into his carriage; she listened to the order that he gave, and\nheard the Swiss repeat it to the coachman:\n\"To M. de Rochefide's house.\"\nThose words, and the way in which M. d'Ajuda flung himself back in the carriage, were like a\nlightning flash and a thunderbolt for her; she walked back again with a deadly fear gnawing at her heart.\nThe most terrible catastrophes only happen among the heights. The Vicomtesse went to her own room, sat\ndown at a table, and took up a sheet of dainty notepaper.\n\"When, instead of dining with the English Ambassador,\" she wrote, \"you go to the\nRochefides, you owe me an explanation, which I am waiting to hear.\"\nShe retraced several of the letters, for her hand was trembling so that they were indistinct; then\nshe signed the note with an initial C for \"Claire de Bourgogne,\" and rang the bell.\n\"Jacques,\" she said to the servant, who appeared immediately, \"take this note to M. de\nRochefide's house at half-past seven and ask for the Marquis d'Ajuda. If M. d'Ajuda is there, leave the\nnote without waiting for an answer; if he is not there, bring the note back to me.\"\n\"Madame la Vicomtess, there is a visitor in the drawing-room.\"\n\"Ah! yes, of course,\" she said, opening the door.\nEugene was beginning to feel very uncomfortable, but at last the Vicomtesse appeared; she spoke\nto him, and the tremulous tones of her voice vibrated through his heart.\n\n\"Pardon me, monsieur,\" she said; \"I had a letter to write. Now I am quite at liberty.\"\nShe scarcely knew what she was saying, for even as she spoke she thought, \"Ah! he means to\nmarry Mlle. de Rochefide? But is he still free? This evening the marriage shall be broken off, or else . . .\nBut before to-morrow I shall know.\"\n\"Cousin . . .\" the student replied.\n\"Eh?\" said the Countess, with an insolent glance that sent a cold shudder through Eugene; he\nunderstood what that \"Eh?\" meant; he had learned a great deal in three hours, and his wits were on the\nalert. He reddened:\n\"Madame . . .\" he began; he hesitated a moment, and then went on. \"Pardon me; I am in such\nneed of protection that the nearest scrap of relationship could do me no harm.\"\nMme. de Beauseant smiled but there was sadness in her smile; even now she felt forebodings of\nthe coming pain, the air she breathed was heavy with the storm that was about to burst.\n\"If you knew how my family are situated,\" he went on, \"you would love to play the part of a\nbeneficent fairy godmother who graciously clears the obstacles from the path of her protege.\"\n\"Well, cousin,\" she said, laughing, \"and how can I be of service to you?\"\n\"But do I know even that? I am distantly related to you, and this obscure and remote relationship\nis even now a perfect godsend to me. You have confused my ideas; I cannot remember the things that I\nmeant to say to you. I know no one else here in Paris. . . . Ah! if I could only ask you to counsel me, ask\nyou to look upon me as a poor child who would fain cling to the hem of your dress, who would lay down\nhis life for you.\"\n\"Would you kill a man for me?\"\n\"Two,\" said Eugene.\n\"You, child. Yes, you are a child,\" she said, keeping back the tears that came to her eyes; \"you\nwould love sincerely.\"\n\"Oh!\" he cried, flinging up his head.\nThe audacity of the student's answer interested the Vicomtesse in him. The southern brain was\nbeginning to scheme for the first time. Between Mme. de Restaud's blue boudoir and Mme. de\nBeauseant's rose-colored drawing-room he had made a three years' advance in a kind of law which is not a\nrecognized study in Paris, although it is a sort of higher jurisprudence, and, when well understood, is a\nhighroad to success of every kind.\n\"Ah! that is what I meant to say!\" said Eugene. \"I met Mme. de Restaud at your ball, and this\nmorning I went to see her.\n\"You must have been very much in the way,\" said Mme. de Beauseant, smiling as she spoke.\n\n\"Yes, indeed. I am a novice, and my blunders will set every one against me, if you do not give me\nyour counsel. I believe that in Paris it is very difficult to meet with a young, beautiful, and wealthy\nwoman of fashion who would be willing to teach me, what you women can explain so well--life. I shall\nfind a M. de Trailles everywhere. So I have come to you to ask you to give me a key to a puzzle, to\nentreat you to tell me what sort of blunder I made this morning. I mentioned an old man----\"\n\"Madame la Duchess de Langeais,\" Jacques cut the student short; Eugene gave expression to his\nintense annoyance by a gesture.\n\"If you mean to succeed,\" said the Vicomtesse in a low voice, \"in the first place you must not be\nso demonstrative.\"\n\"Ah! good morning, dear,\" she continued, and rising and crossing the room, she grasped the\nDuchess' hands as affectionately as if they had been sisters; the Duchess responded in the prettiest and\nmost gracious way.\n\"Two intimate friends!\" said Rastignac to himself. \"Henceforward I shall have two protectresses;\nthose two women are great friends, no doubt, and this newcomer will doubtless interest herself in her\nfriend's cousin.\"\n\"To what happy inspiration do I owe this piece of good fortune, dear Antoinette?\" asked Mme. de\nBeauseant.\n\"Well, I saw M. d'Ajuda-Pinto at M. de Rochefide's door, so I thought that if I came I should find\nyou alone.\"\nMme. de Beauseant's mouth did not tighten, her color did not rise, her expression did not alter, or\nrather, her brow seemed to clear as the Duchess uttered those deadly words.\n\"If I had known that you were engaged----\" the speaker added, glancing at Eugene.\n\"This gentleman is M. Eugene de Rastignac, one of my cousins,\" said the Vicomtesse. \"Have you\nany news of General de Montriveau?\" she continued. \"Serizy told me yesterday that he never goes\nanywhere now; has he been to see you to-day?\"\nIt was believed that the Duchess was desperately in love with M. de Montriveau, and that he was\na faithless lover; she felt the question in her very heart, and her face flushed as she answered:\n\"He was at the Elysee yesterday.\"\n\"In attendance?\"\n\"Claire,\" returned the Duchess, and hatred overflowed in the glances she threw at Mme. de\nBeauseant; \"of course you know that M. d'Ajuda-Pinto is going to marry Mlle. de Rochefide; the bans\nwill be published to-morrow.\"\nThis thrust was too cruel; the Vicomtesse's face grew white, but she answered, laughing, \"One of\nthose rumors that fools amuse themselves with. What should induce M. d'Ajuda to take one of the noblest\nnames in Portugal to the Rochefides? The Rochefides were only ennobled yesterday.\"\n\n\"But Bertha will have two hundred thousand livres a year, they say.\"\n\"M. d'Ajuda is too wealthy to marry for money.\"\n\"But, my dear, Mlle. de Rochefide is a charming girl.\"\n\"Indeed?\"\n\"And, as a matter of fact, he is dining with them to-day; the thing is settled. It is very surprising to\nme that you should know so little about it.\"\nMme. de Beauseant turned to Rastignac. \"What was the blunder that you made, monsieur?\" she\nasked. \"The poor boy is only just launched into the world, Antoinette, so that he understands nothing of\nall this that we are speaking of. Be merciful to him, and let us finish our talk to-morrow. Everything will\nbe announced to-morrow, you know, and your kind informal communication can be accompanied by\nofficial confirmation.\"\nThe Duchess gave Eugene one of those insolent glances that measure a man from head to foot,\nand leave him crushed and annihilated.\n\"Madame, I have unwittingly plunged a dagger into Mme. de Restaud's heart;\nunwittingly--therein lies my offence,\" said the student of law, whose keen brain had served him\nsufficiently well, for he had detected the biting epigrams that lurked beneath this friendly talk. \"You\ncontinue to receive, possibly you fear, those who know the amount of pain that they deliberately inflict;\nbut a clumsy blunderer who has no idea how deeply he wounds is looked upon as a fool who does not\nknow how to make use of his opportunities, and every one despises him.\"\nMme. de Beauseant gave the student a glance, one of those glances in which a great soul can\nmingle dignity and gratitude. It was like balm to the law student, who was still smarting under the\nDuchess' insolent scrutiny; she had looked at him as an auctioneer might look at some article to appraise\nits value.\n\"Imagine, too, that I had just made some progress with the Comte de Restaud; for I should tell\nyou, madame,\" he went on, turning to the Duchess with a mixture of humility and malice in his manner,\n\"that as yet I am only a poor devil of a student, very much alone in the world, and very poor----\"\n\"You should not tell us that, M. de Rastignac. We women never care about anything that no one\nelse will take.\"\n\"Bah!\" said Eugene. \"I am only two-and-twenty, and I must make up my mind to the drawbacks\nof my time of life. Besides, I am confessing my sins, and it would be impossible to kneel in a more\ncharming confessional; you commit your sins in one drawing-room, and receive absolution for them in\nanother.\"\nThe Duchess' expression grew colder, she did not like the flippant tone of these remarks, and\nshowed that she considered them to be in bad taste by turning to the Vicomtesse with--\"This gentleman\nhas only just come----\"\nMme. de Beauseant began to laugh outright at her cousin and at the Duchess both.\n\n\"He has only just come to Paris, dear, and is in search of some one who will give him lessons in\ngood taste.\"\n\"Mme. la Duchesse,\" said Eugene, \"is it not natural to wish to be initiated into the mysteries\nwhich charm us?\" (\"Come, now,\" he said to himself, \"my language is superfinely elegant, I'm sure.\")\n\"But Mme. de Restaud is herself, I believe, M. de Trailles' pupil,\" said the Duchess.\n\"Of that I had no idea, madame,\" answered the law student, \"so I rashly came between them. In\nfact, I got on very well with the lady's husband, and his wife tolerated me for a time until I took it into my\nhead to tell them that I knew some one of whom I had just caught a glimpse as he went out by a back\nstaircase, a man who had given the Countess a kiss at the end of a passage.\"\n\"Who was it?\" both women asked together.\n\"An old man who lives at the rate of two louis a month in the Faubourg Saint-Marceau, where I, a\npoor student, lodge likewise. He is a truly unfortunate creature, everybody laughs at him--we all call him\n'Father Goriot.'\"\n\"Why, child that you are,\" cried the Vicomtesse, \"Mme. de Restaud was a Mlle. Goriot!\"\n\"The daughter of a vermicelli manufacturer,\" the Duchess added; \"and when the little creature\nwent to Court, the daughter of a pastry-cook was presented on the same day. Do you remember, Claire?\nThe King began to laugh, and made some joke in Latin about flour. People--what was it?--people----\"\n\"_Ejusdem farinoe_,\" said Eugene.\n\"Yes, that was it,\" said the Duchess.\n\"Oh! is that her father?\" the law student continued, aghast.\n\"Yes, certainly; the old man had two daughters; he dotes on them, so to speak, though they will\nscarcely acknowledge him.\"\n\"Didn't the second daughter marry a banker with a German name?\" the Vicomtesse asked, turning\nto Mme. de Langeais, \"a Baron de Nucingen? And her name is Delphine, is it not? Isn't she a fair-haired\nwoman who has a side-box at the Opera? She comes sometimes to the Bouffons, and laughs loudly to\nattract attention.\"\nThe Duchess smiled and said:\n\"I wonder at you, dear. Why do you take so much interest in people of that kind? One must have\nbeen as madly in love as Restaud was, to be infatuated with Mlle. Anastasie and her flour sacks. Oh! he\nwill not find her a good bargain! She is in M. de Trailles' hands, and he will ruin her.\"\n\"And they do not acknowledge their father!\" Eugene repeated.\n\"Oh! well, yes, their father, the father, a father,\" replied the Vicomtesse, \"a kind father who gave\nthem each five or six hundred thousand francs, it is said, to secure their happiness by marrying them well;\n\nwhile he only kept eight or ten thousand livres a year for himself, thinking that his daughters would\nalways be his daughters, thinking that in them he would live his life twice over again, that in their houses\nhe should find two homes, where he would be loved and looked up to, and made much of. And in two\nyears' time both his sons-in-law had turned him out of their houses as if he were one of the lowest\noutcasts.\"\nTears came into Eugene's eyes. He was still under the spell of youthful beliefs, he had just left\nhome, pure and sacred feelings had been stirred within him, and this was his first day on the battlefield of\ncivilization in Paris. Genuine feeling is so infectious that for a moment the three looked at each other in\nsilence.\n\"_Eh, mon Dieu!_\" said Mme. de Langeais; \"yes, it seems very horrible, and yet we see such\nthings every day. Is there not a reason for it? Tell me, dear, have you ever really thought what a\nson-in-law is? A son-in-law is the man for whom we bring up, you and I, a dear little one, bound to us\nvery closely in innumerable ways; for seventeen years she will be the joy of her family, its 'white soul,' as\nLamartine says, and suddenly she will become its scourge. When HE comes and takes her from us, his\nlove from the very beginning is like an axe laid to the root of all the old affection in our darling's heart,\nand all the ties that bound her to her family are severed. But yesterday our little daughter thought of no\none but her mother and father, as we had no thought that was not for her; by to-morrow she will have\nbecome a hostile stranger. The tragedy is always going on under our eyes. On the one hand you see a\nfather who has sacrificed himself to his son, and his daughter-in-law shows him the last degree of\ninsolence. On the other hand, it is the son-in-law who turns his wife's mother out of the house. I\nsometimes hear it said that there is nothing dramatic about society in these days; but the Drama of the\nSon-in-law is appalling, to say nothing of our marriages, which have come to be very poor farces. I can\nexplain how it all came about in the old vermicelli maker's case. I think I recollect that Foriot----\"\n\"Goriot, madame.\"\n\"Yes, that Moriot was once President of his Section during the Revolution. He was in the secret\nof the famous scarcity of grain, and laid the foundation of his fortune in those days by selling flour for ten\ntimes its cost. He had as much flour as he wanted. My grandmother's steward sold him immense\nquantities. No doubt Noriot shared the plunder with the Committee of Public Salvation, as that sort of\nperson always did. I recollect the steward telling my grandmother that she might live at Grandvilliers in\ncomplete security, because her corn was as good as a certificate of civism. Well, then, this Loriot, who\nsold corn to those butchers, has never had but one passion, they say--he idolizes his daughters. He settled\none of them under Restaud's roof, and grafted the other into the Nucingen family tree, the Baron de\nNucingen being a rich banker who had turned Royalist. You can quite understand that so long as\nBonaparte was Emperor, the two sons-in-law could manage to put up with the old Ninety-three; but after\nthe restoration of the Bourbons, M. de Restaud felt bored by the old man's society, and the banker was\nstill more tired of it. His daughters were still fond of him; they wanted 'to keep the goat and the cabbage,'\nso they used to see Joriot whenever there was no one there, under pretence of affection. 'Come to-day,\npapa, we shall have you all to ourselves, and that will be much nicer!' and all that sort of thing. As for me,\ndear, I believe that love has second-sight: poor Ninety-three; his heart must have bled. He saw that his\ndaughters were ashamed of him, that if they loved their husbands his visits must make mischief. So he\nimmolated himself. He made the sacrifice because he was a father; he went into voluntary exile. His\ndaughters were satisfied, so he thought that he had done the best thing he could; but it was a family crime,\nand father and daughters were accomplices. You see this sort of thing everywhere. What could this old\nDoriot have been but a splash of mud in his daughters' drawing-rooms? He would only have been in the\nway, and bored other people, besides being bored himself. And this that happened between father and\n\ndaughters may happen to the prettiest woman in Paris and the man she loves the best; if her love grows\ntiresome, he will go; he will descend to the basest trickery to leave her. It is the same with all love and\nfriendship. Our heart is a treasury; if you pour out all its wealth at once, you are bankrupt. We show no\nmore mercy to the affection that reveals its utmost extent than we do to another kind of prodigal who has\nnot a penny left. Their father had given them all he had. For twenty years he had given his whole heart to\nthem; then, one day, he gave them all his fortune too. The lemon was squeezed; the girls left the rest in\nthe gutter.\"\n\"The world is very base,\" said the Vicomtesse, plucking at the threads of her shawl. She did not\nraise her head as she spoke; the words that Mme. de Langeais had meant for her in the course of her story\nhad cut her to the quick.\n\"Base? Oh, no,\" answered the Duchess; \"the world goes its own way, that is all. If I speak in this\nway, it is only to show that I am not duped by it. I think as you do,\" she said, pressing the Vicomtesse's\nhand. \"The world is a slough; let us try to live on the heights above it.\"\nShe rose to her feet and kissed Mme. de Beauseant on the forehead as she said: \"You look very\ncharming to-day, dear. I have never seen such a lovely color in your cheeks before.\"\nThen she went out with a slight inclination of the head to the cousin.\n\"Father Goriot is sublime!\" said Eugene to himself, as he remembered how he had watched his\nneighbor work the silver vessel into a shapeless mass that night.\nMme. de Beauseant did not hear him; she was absorbed in her own thoughts. For several minutes\nthe silence remained unbroken till the law student became almost paralyzed with embarrassment, and was\nequally afraid to go or stay or speak a word.\n\"The world is basely ungrateful and ill-natured,\" said the Vicomtesse at last. \"No sooner does a\ntrouble befall you than a friend is ready to bring the tidings and to probe your heart with the point of a\ndagger while calling on you to admire the handle. Epigrams and sarcasms already! Ah! I will defend\nmyself!\"\nShe raised her head like the great lady that she was, and lightnings flashed from her proud eyes.\n\"Ah!\" she said, as she saw Eugene, \"are you there?\"\n\"Still,\" he said piteously.\n\"Well, then, M. de Rastignac, deal with the world as it deserves. You are determined to succeed?\nI will help you. You shall sound the depths of corruption in woman; you shall measure the extent of man's\npitiful vanity. Deeply as I am versed in such learning, there were pages in the book of life that I had not\nread. Now I know all. The more cold-blooded your calculations, the further you will go. Strike ruthlessly;\nyou will be feared. Men and women for you must be nothing more than post-horses; take a fresh relay,\nand leave the last to drop by the roadside; in this way you will reach the goal of your ambition. You will\nbe nothing here, you see, unless a woman interests herself in you; and she must be young and wealthy,\nand a woman of the world. Yet, if you have a heart, lock it carefully away like a treasure; do not let any\none suspect it, or you will be lost; you would cease to be the executioner, you would take the victim's\nplace. And if ever you should love, never let your secret escape you! Trust no one until you are very sure\n\nof the heart to which you open your heart. Learn to mistrust every one; take every precaution for the sake\nof the love which does not exist as yet. Listen, Miguel\"--the name slipped from her so naturally that she\ndid not notice her mistake--\"there is something still more appalling than the ingratitude of daughters who\nhave cast off their old father and wish that he were dead, and that is a rivalry between two sisters. Restaud\ncomes of a good family, his wife has been received into their circle; she has been presented at court; and\nher sister, her wealthy sister, Mme. Delphine de Nucingen, the wife of a great capitalist, is consumed with\nenvy, and ready to die of spleen. There is gulf set between the sisters--indeed, they are sisters no\nlonger--the two women who refuse to acknowledge their father do not acknowledge each other. So Mme.\nde Nucingen would lap up all the mud that lies between the Rue Saint-Lazare and the Rue de Grenelle to\ngain admittance to my salon. She fancied that she should gain her end through de Marsay; she has made\nherself de Marsay's slave, and she bores him. De Marsay cares very little about her. If you will introduce\nher to me, you will be her darling, her Benjamin; she will idolize you. If, after that, you can love her, do\nso; if not, make her useful. I will ask her to come once or twice to one of my great crushes, but I will\nnever receive her here in the morning. I will bow to her when I see her, and that will be quite sufficient.\nYou have shut the Comtesse de Restaud's door against you by mentioning Father Goriot's name. Yes, my\ngood friend, you may call at her house twenty times, and every time out of the twenty you will find that\nshe is not at home. The servants have their orders, and will not admit you. Very well, then, now let Father\nGoriot gain the right of entry into her sister's house for you. The beautiful Mme. de Nucingen will give\nthe signal for a battle. As soon as she singles you out, other women will begin to lose their heads about\nyou, and her enemies and rivals and intimate friends will all try to take you from her. There are women\nwho will fall in love with a man because another woman has chosen him; like the city madams, poor\nthings, who copy our millinery, and hope thereby to acquire our manners. You will have a success, and in\nParis success is everything; it is the key of power. If the women credit you with wit and talent, the men\nwill follow suit so long as you do not undeceive them yourself. There will be nothing you may not aspire\nto; you will go everywhere, and you will find out what the world is--an assemblage of fools and knaves.\nBut you must be neither the one nor the other. I am giving you my name like Ariadne's clue of thread to\ntake with you into the labyrinth; make no unworthy use of it,\" she said, with a queenly glance and curve\nof her throat; \"give it back to me unsullied. And now, go; leave me. We women also have our battles to\nfight.\"\n\"And if you should ever need some one who would gladly set a match to a train for you----\"\n\"Well?\" she asked.\nHe tapped his heart, smiled in answer to his cousin's smile, and went.\nIt was five o'clock, and Eugene was hungry; he was afraid lest he should not be in time for dinner,\na misgiving which made him feel that it was pleasant to be borne so quickly across Paris. This sensation\nof physical comfort left his mind free to grapple with the thoughts that assailed him. A mortification\nusually sends a young man of his age into a furious rage; he shakes his fist at society, and vows\nvengeance when his belief in himself is shaken. Just then Rastignac was overwhelmed by the words,\n\"You have shut the Countess' door against you.\"\n\"I shall call!\" he said to himself, \"and if Mme. de Beauseant is right, if I never find her at home--I\n. . . well, Mme. de Restaud shall meet me in every salon in Paris. I will learn to fence and have some\npistol practice, and kill that Maxime of hers!\"\n\"And money?\" cried an inward monitor. \"How about money, where is that to come from?\" And\nall at once the wealth displayed in the Countess de Restaud's drawing-room rose before his eyes. That was\n\nthe luxury which Goriot's daughter had loved too well, the gilding, the ostentatious splendor, the\nunintelligent luxury of the parvenu, the riotous extravagance of a courtesan. Then the attractive vision\nsuddenly went under an eclipse as he remembered the stately grandeur of the Hotel de Beauseant. As his\nfancy wandered among these lofty regions in the great world of Paris, innumerable dark thoughts\ngathered in his heart; his ideas widened, and his conscience grew more elastic. He saw the world as it is;\nsaw how the rich lived beyond the jurisdiction of law and public opinion, and found in success the\n_ultima ratio mundi_.\n\"Vautrin is right, success is virtue!\" he said to himself.\nArrived in the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Genevieve, he rushed up to his room for ten francs wherewith to\nsatisfy the demands of the cabman, and went in to dinner. He glanced round the squalid room, saw the\neighteen poverty-stricken creatures about to feed like cattle in their stalls, and the sight filled him with\nloathing. The transition was too sudden, and the contrast was so violent that it could not but act as a\npowerful stimulant; his ambition developed and grew beyond all social bounds. On the one hand, he\nbeheld a vision of social life in its most charming and refined forms, of quick-pulsed youth, of fair,\nimpassioned faces invested with all the charm of poetry, framed in a marvelous setting of luxury or art;\nand, on the other hand, he saw a sombre picture, the miry verge beyond these faces, in which passion was\nextinct and nothing was left of the drama but the cords and pulleys and bare mechanism. Mme. de\nBeauseant's counsels, the words uttered in anger by the forsaken lady, her petulant offer, came to his\nmind, and poverty was a ready expositor. Rastignac determined to open two parallel trenches so as to\ninsure success; he would be a learned doctor of law and a man of fashion. Clearly he was still a child!\nThose two lines are asymptotes, and will never meet.\n\"You are very dull, my lord Marquis,\" said Vautrin, with one of the shrewd glances that seem to\nread the innermost secrets of another mind.\n\"I am not in the humor to stand jokes from people who call me 'my lord Marquis,'\" answered\nEugene. \"A marquis here in Paris, if he is not the veriest sham, ought to have a hundred thousand livres a\nyear at least; and a lodger in the Maison Vauquer is not exactly Fortune's favorite.\"\nVautrin's glance at Rastignac was half-paternal, half-contemptuous. \"Puppy!\" it seemed to say; \"I\nshould make one mouthful of him!\" Then he answered:\n\"You are in a bad humor; perhaps your visit to the beautiful Comtesse de Restaud was not a\nsuccess.\"\n\"She has shut her door against me because I told her that her father dined at our table,\" cried\nRastignac.\nGlances were exchanged all round the room; Father Goriot looked down.\n\"You have sent some snuff into my eye,\" he said to his neighbor, turning a little aside to rub his\nhand over his face.\n\"Any one who molests Father Goriot will have henceforward to reckon with me,\" said Eugene,\nlooking at the old man's neighbor; \"he is worth all the rest of us put together.--I am not speaking of the\n\nladies,\" he added, turning in the direction of Mlle. Taillefer.\nEugene's remarks produced a sensation, and his tone silenced the dinner-table. Vautrin alone\nspoke. \"If you are going to champion Father Goriot, and set up for his responsible editor into the bargain,\nyou had need be a crack shot and know how to handle the foils,\" he said, banteringly.\n\"So I intend,\" said Eugene.\n\"Then you are taking the field to-day?\"\n\"Perhaps,\" Rastignac answered. \"But I owe no account of myself to any one, especially as I do\nnot try to find out what other people do of a night.\"\nVautrin looked askance at Rastignac.\n\"If you do not mean to be deceived by the puppets, my boy, you must go behind and see the\nwhole show, and not peep through holes in the curtain. That is enough,\" he added, seeing that Eugene was\nabout to fly into a passion. \"We can have a little talk whenever you like.\"\nThere was a general feeling of gloom and constraint. Father Goriot was so deeply dejected by the\nstudent's remark that he did not notice the change in the disposition of his fellow-lodgers, nor know that\nhe had met with a champion capable of putting an end to the persecution.\n\"Then, M. Goriot sitting there is the father of a countess,\" said Mme. Vauquer in a low voice.\n\"And of a baroness,\" answered Rastignac.\n\"That is about all he is capable of,\" said Bianchon to Rastignac; \"I have taken a look at his head;\nthere is only one bump--the bump of Paternity; he must be an _eternal father_.\"\nEugene was too intent on his thoughts to laugh at Bianchon's joke. He determined to profit by\nMme. de Beauseant's counsels, and was asking himself how he could obtain the necessary money. He\ngrew grave. The wide savannas of the world stretched before his eyes; all things lay before him, nothing\nwas his. Dinner came to an end, the others went, and he was left in the dining-room.\n\"So you have seen my daughter?\" Goriot spoke tremulously, and the sound of his voice broke in\nupon Eugene's dreams. The young man took the elder's hand, and looked at him with something like\nkindness in his eyes.\n\"You are a good and noble man,\" he said. \"We will have some talk about your daughters by and\nby.\"\nHe rose without waiting for Goriot's answer, and went to his room. There he wrote the following\nletter to his mother:--\n\"My Dear Mother,--Can you nourish your child from your breast again? I am in a position to\nmake a rapid fortune, but I want twelve hundred francs--I must have them at all costs. Say nothing\nabout this to my father; perhaps he might make objections, and unless I have the money, I may be led to\nput an end to myself, and so escape the clutches of despair. I will tell you everything when I see you. I\n\nwill not begin to try to describe my present situation; it would take volumes to put the whole story\nclearly and fully. I have not been gambling, my kind mother, I owe no one a penny; but if you would\npreserve the life that you gave me, you must send me the sum I mention. As a matter of fact, I go to see\nthe Vicomtesse de Beauseant; she is using her influence for me; I am obliged to go into society, and I\nhave not a penny to lay out on clean gloves. I can manage to exist on bread and water, or go without\nfood, if need be, but I cannot do without the tools with which they cultivate the vineyards in this\ncountry. I must resolutely make up my mind at once to make my way, or stick in the mire for the rest of\nmy days. I know that all your hopes are set on me, and I want to realize them quickly. Sell some of your\nold jewelry, my kind mother; I will give you other jewels very soon. I know enough of our affairs at\nhome to know all that such a sacrifice means, and you must not think that I would lightly ask you to\nmake it; I should be a monster if I could. You must think of my entreaty as a cry forced from me by\nimperative necessity. Our whole future lies in the subsidy with which I must begin my first campaign,\nfor life in Paris is one continual battle. If you cannot otherwise procure the whole of the money, and are\nforced to sell our aunt's lace, tell her that I will send her some still handsomer,\" and so forth.\nHe wrote to ask each of his sisters for their savings--would they despoil themselves for him, and\nkeep the sacrifice a secret from the family? To his request he knew that they would not fail to respond\ngladly, and he added to it an appeal to their delicacy by touching the chord of honor that vibrates so\nloudly in young and high-strung natures.\nYet when he had written the letters, he could not help feeling misgivings in spite of his youthful\nambition; his heart beat fast, and he trembled. He knew the spotless nobleness of the lives buried away in\nthe lonely manor house; he knew what trouble and what joy his request would cause his sisters, and how\nhappy they would be as they talked at the bottom of the orchard of that dear brother of theirs in Paris.\nVisions rose before his eyes; a sudden strong light revealed his sisters secretly counting over their little\nstore, devising some girlish stratagem by which the money could be sent to him _incognito_, essaying, for\nthe first time in their lives, a piece of deceit that reached the sublime in its unselfishness.\n\"A sister's heart is a diamond for purity, a deep sea of tenderness!\" he said to himself. He felt\nashamed of those letters.\nWhat power there must be in the petitions put up by such hearts; how pure the fervor that bears\ntheir souls to Heaven in prayer! What exquisite joy they would find in self-sacrifice! What a pang for his\nmother's heart if she could not send him all that he asked for! And this noble affection, these sacrifices\nmade at such terrible cost, were to serve as the ladder by which he meant to climb to Delphine de\nNucingen. A few tears, like the last grains of incense flung upon the sacred alter fire of the hearth, fell\nfrom his eyes. He walked up and down, and despair mingled with his emotion. Father Goriot saw him\nthrough the half-open door.\n\"What is the matter, sir?\" he asked from the threshold.\n\"Ah! my good neighbor, I am as much a son and brother as you are a father. You do well to fear\nfor the Comtesse Anastasie; there is one M. Maxime de Trailles, who will be her ruin.\"\nFather Goriot withdrew, stammering some words, but Eugene failed to catch their meaning.\nThe next morning Rastignac went out to post his letters. Up to the last moment he wavered and\ndoubted, but he ended by flinging them into the box. \"I shall succeed!\" he said to himself. So says the\ngambler; so says the great captain; but the three words that have been the salvation of some few, have\n\nbeen the ruin of many more.\nA few days after this Eugene called at Mme. de Restaud's house; she was not at home. Three\ntimes he tried the experiment, and three times he found her doors closed against him, though he was\ncareful to choose an hour when M. de Trailles was not there. The Vicomtesse was right.\nThe student studied no longer. He put in an appearance at lectures simply to answer to his name,\nand after thus attesting his presence, departed forthwith. He had been through a reasoning process familiar\nto most students. He had seen the advisability of deferring his studies to the last moment before going up\nfor his examinations; he made up his mind to cram his second and third years' work into the third year,\nwhen he meant to begin to work in earnest, and to complete his studies in law with one great effort. In the\nmeantime he had fifteen months in which to navigate the ocean of Paris, to spread the nets and set the\nlines that would bring him a protectress and a fortune. Twice during that week he saw Mme. de\nBeauseant; he did not go to her house until he had seen the Marquis d'Ajuda drive away.\nVictory for yet a few more days was with the great lady, the most poetic figure in the Faubourg\nSaint-Germain; and the marriage of the Marquis d'Ajuda-Pinto with Mlle. de Rochefide was postponed.\nThe dread of losing her happiness filled those days with a fever of joy unknown before, but the end was\nonly so much the nearer. The Marquis d'Ajuda and the Rochefides agreed that this quarrel and\nreconciliation was a very fortunate thing; Mme. de Beauseant (so they hoped) would gradually become\nreconciled to the idea of the marriage, and in the end would be brought to sacrifice d'Ajuda's morning\nvisits to the exigencies of a man's career, exigencies which she must have foreseen. In spite of the most\nsolemn promises, daily renewed, M. d'Ajuda was playing a part, and the Vicomtesse was eager to be\ndeceived. \"Instead of taking a leap heroically from the window, she is falling headlong down the\nstaircase,\" said her most intimate friend, the Duchesse de Langeais. Yet this after-glow of happiness\nlasted long enough for the Vicomtesse to be of service to her young cousin. She had a half-superstitious\naffection for him. Eugene had shown her sympathy and devotion at a crisis when a woman sees no pity,\nno real comfort in any eyes; when if a man is ready with soothing flatteries, it is because he has an\ninterested motive.\nRastignac made up his mind that he must learn the whole of Goriot's previous history; he would\ncome to his bearings before attempting to board the Maison de Nucingen. The results of his inquiries may\nbe given briefly as follows:--\nIn the days before the Revolution, Jean-Joachim Goriot was simply a workman in the employ of a\nvermicelli maker. He was a skilful, thrifty workman, sufficiently enterprising to buy his master's business\nwhen the latter fell a chance victim to the disturbances of 1789. Goriot established himself in the Rue de\nla Jussienne, close to the Corn Exchange. His plain good sense led him to accept the position of President\nof the Section, so as to secure for his business the protection of those in power at that dangerous epoch.\nThis prudent step had led to success; the foundations of his fortune were laid in the time of the Scarcity\n(real or artificial), when the price of grain of all kinds rose enormously in Paris. People used to fight for\nbread at the bakers' doors; while other persons went to the grocers' shops and bought Italian paste foods\nwithout brawling over it. It was during this year that Goriot made the money, which, at a later time, was\nto give him all the advantage of the great capitalist over the small buyer; he had, moreover, the usual luck\nof average ability; his mediocrity was the salvation of him. He excited no one's envy, it was not even\nsuspected that he was rich till the peril of being rich was over, and all his intelligence was concentrated,\nnot on political, but on commercial speculations. Goriot was an authority second to none on all questions\nrelating to corn, flour, and \"middlings\"; and the production, storage, and quality of grain. He could\nestimate the yield of the harvest, and foresee market prices; he bought his cereals in Sicily, and imported\n\nRussian wheat. Any one who had heard him hold forth on the regulations that control the importation and\nexportation of grain, who had seen his grasp of the subject, his clear insight into the principles involved,\nhis appreciation of weak points in the way that the system worked, would have thought that here was the\nstuff of which a minister is made. Patient, active, and persevering, energetic and prompt in action, he\nsurveyed his business horizon with an eagle eye. Nothing there took him by surprise; he foresaw all\nthings, knew all that was happening, and kept his own counsel; he was a diplomatist in his quick\ncomprehension of a situation; and in the routine of business he was as patient and plodding as a soldier on\nthe march. But beyond this business horizon he could not see. He used to spend his hours of leisure on the\nthreshold of his shop, leaning against the framework of the door. Take him from his dark little\ncounting-house, and he became once more the rough, slow-witted workman, a man who cannot\nunderstand a piece of reasoning, who is indifferent to all intellectual pleasures, and falls asleep at the\nplay, a Parisian Dolibom in short, against whose stupidity other minds are powerless.\nNatures of this kind are nearly all alike; in almost all of them you will find some hidden depth of\nsublime affection. Two all-absorbing affections filled the vermicelli maker's heart to the exclusion of\nevery other feeling; into them he seemed to put all the forces of his nature, as he put the whole power of\nhis brain into the corn trade. He had regarded his wife, the only daughter of a rich farmer of La Brie, with\na devout admiration; his love for her had been boundless. Goriot had felt the charm of a lovely and\nsensitive nature, which, in its delicate strength, was the very opposite of his own. Is there any instinct\nmore deeply implanted in the heart of man than the pride of protection, a protection which is constantly\nexerted for a fragile and defenceless creature? Join love thereto, the warmth of gratitude that all generous\nsouls feel for the source of their pleasures, and you have the explanation of many strange incongruities in\nhuman nature.\nAfter seven years of unclouded happiness, Goriot lost his wife. It was very unfortunate for him.\nShe was beginning to gain an ascendency over him in other ways; possibly she might have brought that\nbarren soil under cultivation, she might have widened his ideas and given other directions to his thoughts.\nBut when she was dead, the instinct of fatherhood developed in him till it almost became a mania. All the\naffection balked by death seemed to turn to his daughters, and he found full satisfaction for his heart in\nloving them. More or less brilliant proposals were made to him from time to time; wealthy merchants or\nfarmers with daughters vied with each other in offering inducements to him to marry again; but he\ndetermined to remain a widower. His father-in-law, the only man for whom he felt a decided friendship,\ngave out that Goriot had made a vow to be faithful to his wife's memory. The frequenters of the Corn\nExchange, who could not comprehend this sublime piece of folly, joked about it among themselves, and\nfound a ridiculous nickname for him. One of them ventured (after a glass over a bargain) to call him by it,\nand a blow from the vermicelli maker's fist sent him headlong into a gutter in the Rue Oblin. He could\nthink of nothing else when his children were concerned; his love for them made him fidgety and anxious;\nand this was so well known, that one day a competitor, who wished to get rid of him to secure the field to\nhimself, told Goriot that Delphine had just been knocked down by a cab. The vermicelli maker turned\nghastly pale, left the Exchange at once, and did not return for several days afterwards; he was ill in\nconsequence of the shock and the subsequent relief on discovering that it was a false alarm. This time,\nhowever, the offender did not escape with a bruised shoulder; at a critical moment in the man's affairs,\nGoriot drove him into bankruptcy, and forced him to disappear from the Corn Exchange.\nAs might have been expected, the two girls were spoiled. With an income of sixty thousand\nfrancs, Goriot scarcely spent twelve hundred on himself, and found all his happiness in satisfying the\nwhims of the two girls. The best masters were engaged, that Anastasie and Delphine might be endowed\nwith all the accomplishments which distinguish a good education. They had a chaperon--luckily for them,\nshe was a woman who had good sense and good taste;--they learned to ride; they had a carriage for their\n\nuse; they lived as the mistress of a rich old lord might live; they had only to express a wish, their father\nwould hasten to give them their most extravagant desires, and asked nothing of them in return but a kiss.\nGoriot had raised the two girls to the level of the angels; and, quite naturally, he himself was left beneath\nthem. Poor man! he loved them even for the pain that they gave him.\nWhen the girls were old enough to be married, they were left free to choose for themselves. Each\nhad half her father's fortune as her dowry; and when the Comte de Restaud came to woo Anastasie for her\nbeauty, her social aspirations led her to leave her father's house for a more exalted sphere. Delphine\nwished for money; she married Nucingen, a banker of German extraction, who became a Baron of the\nHoly Roman Empire. Goriot remained a vermicelli maker as before. His daughters and his sons-in-law\nbegan to demur; they did not like to see him still engaged in trade, though his whole life was bound up\nwith his business. For five years he stood out against their entreaties, then he yielded, and consented to\nretire on the amount realized by the sale of his business and the savings of the last few years. It was this\ncapital that Mme. Vauquer, in the early days of his residence with her, had calculated would bring in eight\nor ten thousand livres in a year. He had taken refuge in her lodging-house, driven there by despair when\nhe knew that his daughters were compelled by their husbands not only to refuse to receive him as an\ninmate in their houses, but even to see him no more except in private.\nThis was all the information which Rastignac gained from a M. Muret who had purchased\nGoriot's business, information which confirmed the Duchesse de Langeais' suppositions, and herewith the\npreliminary explanation of this obscure but terrible Parisian tragedy comes to an end.\nTowards the end of the first week in December Rastignac received two letters--one from his\nmother, and one from his eldest sister. His heart beat fast, half with happiness, half with fear, at the sight\nof the familiar handwriting. Those two little scraps of paper contained life or death for his hopes. But\nwhile he felt a shiver of dread as he remembered their dire poverty at home, he knew their love for him so\nwell that he could not help fearing that he was draining their very life-blood. His mother's letter ran as\nfollows:--\n\"MY DEAR CHILD,--I am sending you the money that you asked for. Make a good use of it.\nEven to save your life I could not raise so large a sum a second time without your father's knowledge,\nand there would be trouble about it. We should be obliged to mortgage the land. It is impossible to\njudge of the merits of schemes of which I am ignorant; but what sort of schemes can they be, that you\nshould fear to tell me about them? Volumes of explanation would not have been needed; we mothers can\nunderstand at a word, and that word would have spared me the anguish of uncertainty. I do not know\nhow to hide the painful impression that your letter has made upon me, my dear son. What can you have\nfelt when you were moved to send this chill of dread through my heart? It must have been very painful\nto you to write the letter that gave me so much pain as I read it. To what courses are you committed?\nYou are going to appear to be something that you are not, and your whole life and success depends\nupon this? You are about to see a society into which you cannot enter without rushing into expense that\nyou cannot afford, without losing precious time that is needed for your studies. Ah! my dear Eugene,\nbelieve your mother, crooked ways cannot lead to great ends. Patience and endurance are the two\nqualities most needed in your position. I am not scolding you; I do not want any tinge of bitterness to\nspoil our offering. I am only talking like a mother whose trust in you is as great as her foresight for\nyou. You know the steps that you must take, and I, for my part, know the purity of heart, and how good\nyour intentions are; so I can say to you without a doubt, 'Go forward, beloved!' If I tremble, it is\nbecause I am a mother, but my prayers and blessings will be with you at every step. Be very careful,\ndear boy. You must have a man's prudence, for it lies with you to shape the destinies of five others who\nare dear to you, and must look to you. Yes, our fortunes depend upon you, and your success is ours.\n\nWe all pray to God to be with you in all that you do. Your aunt Marcillac has been most generous\nbeyond words in this matter; she saw at once how it was, even down to your gloves. 'But I have a\nweakness for the eldest!' she said gaily. You must love your aunt very much, dear Eugene. I shall wait\ntill you have succeeded before telling you all that she has done for you, or her money would burn your\nfingers. You, who are young, do not know what it is to part with something that is a piece of your past!\nBut what would we not sacrifice for your sakes? Your aunt says that I am to send you a kiss on the\nforehead from her, and that kiss is to bring you luck again and again, she says. She would have written\nyou herself, the dear kind-hearted woman, but she is troubled with the gout in her fingers just now.\nYour father is very well. The vintage of 1819 has turned out better than we expected. Good-bye, dear\nboy; I will say nothing about your sisters, because Laure is writing to you, and I must let her have the\npleasure of giving you all the home news. Heaven send that you may succeed! Oh! yes, dear Eugene,\nyou must succeed. I have come, through you, to a knowledge of a pain so sharp that I do not think I\ncould endure it a second time. I have come to know what it is to be poor, and to long for money for my\nchildren's sake. There, good-bye! Do not leave us for long without news of you; and here, at the last,\ntake a kiss from your mother.\"\nBy the time Eugene had finished the letter he was in tears. He thought of Father Goriot crushing\nhis silver keepsake into a shapeless mass before he sold it to meet his daughter's bill of exchange.\n\"Your mother has broken up her jewels for you,\" he said to himself; \"your aunt shed tears over\nthose relics of hers before she sold them for your sake. What right have you to heap execrations on\nAnastasie? You have followed her example; you have selfishly sacrificed others to your own future, and\nshe sacrifices her father to her lover; and of you two, which is the worse?\"\nHe was ready to renounce his attempts; he could not bear to take that money. The fires of remorse\nburned in his heart, and gave him intolerable pain, the generous secret remorse which men seldom take\ninto account when they sit in judgment upon their fellow-men; but perhaps the angels in heaven,\nbeholding it, pardon the criminal whom our justice condemns. Rastignac opened his sister's letter; its\nsimplicity and kindness revived his heart.\n\"Your letter came just at the right time, dear brother. Agathe and I had thought of so many\ndifferent ways of spending our money, that we did not know what to buy with it; and now you have\ncome in, and, like the servant who upset all the watches that belonged to the King of Spain, you have\nrestored harmony; for, really and truly, we did not know which of all the things we wanted we wanted\nmost, and we were always quarreling about it, never thinking, dear Eugene, of a way of spending our\nmoney which would satisfy us completely. Agathe jumped for you. Indeed, we have been like two mad\nthings all day, 'to such a prodigious degree' (as aunt would say), that mother said, with her severe\nexpression, 'Whatever can be the matter with you, mesdemoiselles?' I think if we had been scolded a\nlittle, we should have been still better pleased. A woman ought to be very glad to suffer for one she\nloves! I, however, in my inmost soul, was doleful and cross in the midst of all my joy. I shall make a\nbad wife, I am afraid, I am too fond of spending. I had bought two sashes and a nice little stiletto for\npiercing eyelet-holes in my stays, trifles that I really did not want, so that I have less than that\nslow-coach Agathe, who is so economical, and hoards her money like a magpie. She had two hundred\nfrancs! And I have only one hundred and fifty! I am nicely punished; I could throw my sash down the\nwell; it will be painful to me to wear it now. Poor dear, I have robbed you. And Agathe was so nice\nabout it. She said, 'Let us send the three hundred and fifty francs in our two names!' But I could not help\ntelling you everything just as it happened.\n\"Do you know how we managed to keep your commandments? We took our glittering hoard,\n\nwe went out for a walk, and when once fairly on the highway we ran all the way to Ruffec, where we\nhanded over the coin, without more ado, to M. Grimbert of the Messageries Royales. We came back\nagain like swallows on the wing. 'Don't you think that happiness has made us lighter?' Agathe said. We\nsaid all sorts of things, which I shall not tell you, Monsieur le Parisien, because they were all about\nyou. Oh, we love you dearly, dear brother; it was all summed up in those few words. As for keeping the\nsecret, little masqueraders like us are capable of anything (according to our aunt), even of holding our\ntongues. Our mother has been on a mysterious journey to Angouleme, and the aunt went with her, not\nwithout solemn councils, from which we were shut out, and M. le Baron likewise. They are silent as to\nthe weighty political considerations that prompted their mission, and conjectures are rife in the State of\nRastignac. The Infantas are embroidering a muslin robe with open-work sprigs for her Majesty the\nQueen; the work progresses in the most profound secrecy. There be but two more breadths to finish. A\ndecree has gone forth that no wall shall be built on the side of Verteuil, but that a hedge shall be\nplanted instead thereof. Our subjects may sustain some disappointment of fruit and espaliers, but\nstrangers will enjoy a fair prospect. Should the heir-presumptive lack pocket-handkerchiefs, be it\nknown unto him that the dowager Lady of Marcillac, exploring the recesses of her drawers and boxes\n(known respectively as Pompeii and Herculaneum), having brought to light a fair piece of cambric\nwhereof she wotted not, the Princesses Agathe and Laure place at their brother's disposal their thread,\ntheir needles, and hands somewhat of the reddest. The two young Princes, Don Henri and Don Gabriel,\nretain their fatal habits of stuffing themselves with grape-jelly, of teasing their sisters, of taking their\npleasure by going a-bird-nesting, and of cutting switches for themselves from the osier-beds, maugre the\nlaws of the realm. Moreover, they list not to learn naught, wherefore the Papal Nuncio (called of the\ncommonalty, M. le Cure) threateneth them with excommunication, since that they neglect the sacred\ncanons of grammatical construction for the construction of other canon, deadly engines made of the\nstems of elder.\n\"Farewell, dear brother, never did letter carry so many wishes for your success, so much love\nfully satisfied. You will have a great deal to tell us when you come home! You will tell me everything,\nwon't you? I am the oldest. From something the aunt let fall, we think you must have had some success.\n\"Something was said of a lady, but nothing more was said . . .\n\"Of course not, in our family! Oh, by-the-by, Eugene, would you rather that we made that piece\nof cambric into shirts for you instead of pocket-handkerchiefs? If you want some really nice shirts at\nonce, we ought to lose no time in beginning upon them; and if the fashion is different now in Paris, send\nus one for a pattern; we want more particularly to know about the cuffs. Good- bye! Good-bye! Take\nmy kiss on the left side of your forehead, on the temple that belongs to me, and to no one else in the\nworld. I am leaving the other side of the sheet for Agathe, who has solemnly promised not to read a\nword that I have written; but, all the same, I mean to sit by her side while she writes, so as to be quite\nsure that she keeps her word.--Your loving sister,\n\"LAURE DE RASTIGNAC.\"\n\"Yes!\" said Eugene to himself. \"Yes! Success at all costs now! Riches could not repay such\ndevotion as this. I wish I could give them every sort of happiness! Fifteen hundred and fifty francs,\" he\nwent on after a pause. \"Every shot must go to the mark! Laure is right. Trust a woman! I have only calico\nshirts. Where some one else's welfare is concerned, a young girl becomes as ingenious as a thief.\nGuileless where she herself is in question, and full of foresight for me,--she is like a heavenly angel\nforgiving the strange incomprehensible sins of earth.\"\n\nThe world lay before him. His tailor had been summoned and sounded, and had finally\nsurrendered. When Rastignac met M. de Trailles, he had seen at once how great a part the tailor plays in a\nyoung man's career; a tailor is either a deadly enemy or a staunch friend, with an invoice for a bond of\nfriendship; between these two extremes there is, alack! no middle term. In this representative of his craft\nEugene discovered a man who understood that his was a sort of paternal function for young men at their\nentrance into life, who regarded himself as a stepping-stone between a young man's present and future.\nAnd Rastignac in gratitude made the man's fortune by an epigram of a kind in which he excelled at a later\nperiod of his life.\n\"I have twice known a pair of trousers turned out by him make a match of twenty thousand livres\na year!\"\nFifteen hundred francs, and as many suits of clothes as he chose to order! At that moment the\npoor child of the South felt no more doubts of any kind. The young man went down to breakfast with the\nindefinable air which the consciousness of the possession of money gives to youth. No sooner are the\ncoins slipped into a student's pocket than his wealth, in imagination at least, is piled into a fantastic\ncolumn, which affords him a moral support. He begins to hold up his head as he walks; he is conscious\nthat he has a means of bringing his powers to bear on a given point; he looks you straight in the face; his\ngestures are quick and decided; only yesterday he was diffident and shy, any one might have pushed him\naside; to-morrow, he will take the wall of a prime minister. A miracle has been wrought in him. Nothing\nis beyond the reach of his ambition, and his ambition soars at random; he is light-hearted, generous, and\nenthusiastic; in short, the fledgling bird has discovered that he has wings. A poor student snatches at\nevery chance pleasure much as a dog runs all sorts of risks to steal a bone, cracking it and sucking the\nmarrow as he flies from pursuit; but a young man who can rattle a few runaway gold coins in his pocket\ncan take his pleasure deliberately, can taste the whole of the sweets of secure possession; he soars far\nabove earth; he has forgotten what the word _poverty_ means; all Paris is his. Those are days when the\nwhole world shines radiant with light, when everything glows and sparkles before the eyes of youth, days\nthat bring joyous energy that is never brought into harness, days of debts and of painful fears that go hand\nin hand with every delight. Those who do not know the left bank of the Seine between the Rue\nSaint-Jacques and the Rue des Saints-Peres know nothing of life.\n\"Ah! if the women of Paris but knew,\" said Rastignac, as he devoured Mme. Vauquer's stewed\npears (at five for a penny), \"they would come here in search of a lover.\"\nJust then a porter from the Messageries Royales appeared at the door of the room; they had\npreviously heard the bell ring as the wicket opened to admit him. The man asked for M. Eugene de\nRastignac, holding out two bags for him to take, and a form of receipt for his signature. Vautrin's keen\nglance cut Eugene like a lash.\n\"Now you will be able to pay for those fencing lessons and go to the shooting gallery,\" he said.\n\"Your ship has come in,\" said Mme. Vauquer, eyeing the bags.\nMlle. Michonneau did not dare to look at the money, for fear her eyes should betray her cupidity.\n\"You have a kind mother,\" said Mme. Couture.\n\"You have a kind mother, sir,\" echoed Poiret.\n\n\"Yes, mamma has been drained dry,\" said Vautrin, \"and now you can have your fling, go into\nsociety, and fish for heiresses, and dance with countesses who have peach blossom in their hair. But take\nmy advice, young man, and don't neglect your pistol practice.\"\nVautrin struck an attitude, as if he were facing an antagonist. Rastignac, meaning to give the\nporter a tip, felt in his pockets and found nothing. Vautrin flung down a franc piece on the table.\n\"Your credit is good,\" he remarked, eyeing the student, and Rastignac was forced to thank him,\nthough, since the sharp encounter of wits at dinner that day, after Eugene came in from calling on Mme.\nde Beauseant, he had made up his mind that Vautrin was insufferable. For a week, in fact, they had both\nkept silence in each other's presence, and watched each other. The student tried in vain to account to\nhimself for this attitude.\nAn idea, of course, gains in force by the energy with which it is expressed; it strikes where the\nbrain sends it, by a law as mathematically exact as the law that determines the course of a shell from a\nmortar. The amount of impression it makes is not to be determined so exactly. Sometimes, in an\nimpressible nature, the idea works havoc, but there are, no less, natures so robustly protected, that this\nsort of projectile falls flat and harmless on skulls of triple brass, as cannon-shot against solid masonry;\nthen there are flaccid and spongy-fibred natures into which ideas from without sink like spent bullets into\nthe earthworks of a redoubt. Rastignac's head was something of the powder-magazine order; the least\nshock sufficed to bring about an explosion. He was too quick, too young, not to be readily accessible to\nideas; and open to that subtle influence of thought and feeling in others which causes so many strange\nphenomena that make an impression upon us of which we are all unconscious at the time. Nothing\nescaped his mental vision; he was lynx-eyed; in him the mental powers of perception, which seem like\nduplicates of the senses, had the mysterious power of swift projection that astonishes us in intellects of a\nhigh order--slingers who are quick to detect the weak spot in any armor.\nIn the past month Eugene's good qualities and defects had rapidly developed with his character.\nIntercourse with the world and the endeavor to satisfy his growing desires had brought out his defects.\nBut Rastignac came from the South side of the Loire, and had the good qualities of his countrymen. He\nhad the impetuous courage of the South, that rushes to the attack of a difficulty, as well as the southern\nimpatience of delay or suspense. These traits are held to be defects in the North; they made the fortune of\nMurat, but they likewise cut short his career. The moral would appear to be that when the dash and\nboldness of the South side of the Loire meets, in a southern temperament, with the guile of the North, the\ncharacter is complete, and such a man will gain (and keep) the crown of Sweden.\nRastignac, therefore, could not stand the fire from Vautrin's batteries for long without discovering\nwhether this was a friend or a foe. He felt as if this strange being was reading his inmost soul, and\ndissecting his feelings, while Vautrin himself was so close and secretive that he seemed to have\nsomething of the profound and unmoved serenity of a sphinx, seeing and hearing all things and saying\nnothing. Eugene, conscious of that money in his pocket, grew rebellious.\n\"Be so good as to wait a moment,\" he said to Vautrin, as the latter rose, after slowly emptying his\ncoffee-cup, sip by sip.\n\"What for?\" inquired the older man, as he put on his large-brimmed hat and took up the\nsword-cane that he was wont to twirl like a man who will face three or four footpads without flinching.\n\"I will repay you in a minute,\" returned Eugene. He unsealed one of the bags as he spoke,\n\ncounted out a hundred and forty francs, and pushed them towards Mme. Vauquer. \"Short reckonings\nmake good friends\" he added, turning to the widow; \"that clears our accounts till the end of the year. Can\nyou give me change for a five-franc piece?\"\n\"Good friends make short reckonings,\" echoed Poiret, with a glance at Vautrin.\n\"Here is your franc,\" said Rastignac, holding out the coin to the sphinx in the black wig.\n\"Any one might think that you were afraid to owe me a trifle,\" exclaimed this latter, with a\nsearching glance that seemed to read the young man's inmost thoughts; there was a satirical and cynical\nsmile on Vautrin's face such as Eugene had seen scores of times already; every time he saw it, it\nexasperated him almost beyond endurance.\n\"Well . . . so I am,\" he answered. He held both the bags in his hand, and had risen to go up to his\nroom.\nVautrin made as if he were going out through the sitting-room, and the student turned to go\nthrough the second door that opened into the square lobby at the foot of the staircase.\n\"Do you know, Monsieur le Marquis de Rastignacorama, that what you were saying just now was\nnot exactly polite?\" Vautrin remarked, as he rattled his sword-cane across the panels of the sitting-room\ndoor, and came up to the student.\nRastignac looked coolly at Vautrin, drew him to the foot of the staircase, and shut the\ndining-room door. They were standing in the little square lobby between the kitchen and the dining-room;\nthe place was lighted by an iron-barred fanlight above a door that gave access into the garden. Sylvie\ncame out of her kitchen, and Eugene chose that moment to say:\n\"_Monsieur_ Vautrin, I am not a marquis, and my name is not Rastignacorama.\"\n\"They will fight,\" said Mlle. Michonneau, in an indifferent tone.\n\"Fight!\" echoed Poiret.\n\"Not they,\" replied Mme. Vauquer, lovingly fingering her pile of coins.\n\"But there they are under the lime-trees,\" cried Mlle. Victorine, who had risen so that she might\nsee out into the garden. \"Poor young man! he was in the right, after all.\"\n\"We must go upstairs, my pet,\" said Mme. Couture; \"it is no business of ours.\"\nAt the door, however, Mme. Couture and Victorine found their progress barred by the portly form\nof Sylvie the cook.\n\"What ever can have happened?\" she said. \"M. Vautrin said to M. Eugene, 'Let us have an\nexplanation!' then he took him by the arm, and there they are, out among the artichokes.\"\nVautrin came in while she was speaking. \"Mamma Vauquer,\" he said smiling, \"don't frighten\nyourself at all. I am only going to try my pistols under the lime-trees.\"\n\n\"Oh! monsieur,\" cried Victorine, clasping her hands as she spoke, \"why do you want to kill M.\nEugene?\"\nVautrin stepped back a pace or two, and gazed at Victorine.\n\"Oh! this is something fresh!\" he exclaimed in a bantering tone, that brought the color into the\npoor girl's face. \"That young fellow yonder is very nice, isn't he?\" he went on. \"You have given me a\nnotion, my pretty child; I will make you both happy.\"\nMme. Couture laid her hand on the arm of her ward, and drew the girl away, as she said in her\near:\n\"Why, Victorine, I cannot imagine what has come over you this morning.\"\n\"I don't want any shots fired in my garden,\" said Mme. Vauquer. \"You will frighten the\nneighborhood and bring the police up here all in a moment.\"\n\"Come, keep cool, Mamma Vauquer,\" answered Vautrin. \"There, there; it's all right; we will go to\nthe shooting-gallery.\"\nHe went back to Rastignac, laying his hand familiarly on the young man's arm.\n\"When I have given you ocular demonstration of the fact that I can put a bullet through the ace on\na card five times running at thirty-five paces,\" he said, \"that won't take away your appetite, I suppose?\nYou look to me to be inclined to be a trifle quarrelsome this morning, and as if you would rush on your\ndeath like a blockhead.\"\n\"Do you draw back?\" asked Eugene.\n\"Don't try to raise my temperature,\" answered Vautrin, \"it is not cold this morning. Let us go and\nsit over there,\" he added, pointing to the green-painted garden seats; \"no one can overhear us. I want a\nlittle talk with you. You are not a bad sort of youngster, and I have no quarrel with you. I like you, take\nTrump--(confound it!)--take Vautrin's word for it. What makes me like you? I will tell you by-and-by.\nMeantime, I can tell you that I know you as well as if I had made you myself, as I will prove to you in a\nminute. Put down your bags,\" he continued, pointing to the round table.\nRastignac deposited his money on the table, and sat down. He was consumed with curiosity,\nwhich the sudden change in the manner of the man before him had excited to the highest pitch. Here was\na strange being who, a moment ago, had talked of killing him, and now posed as his protector.\n\"You would like to know who I really am, what I was, and what I do now,\" Vautrin went on.\n\"You want to know too much, youngster. Come! come! keep cool! You will hear more astonishing things\nthan that. I have had my misfortunes. Just hear me out first, and you shall have your turn afterwards. Here\nis my past in three words. Who am I? Vautrin. What do I do? Just what I please. Let us change the\nsubject. You want to know my character. I am good-natured to those who do me a good turn, or to those\nwhose hearts speak to mine. These last may do anything they like with me; they may bruise my shins, and\nI shall not tell them to 'mind what they are about'; but, _nom d'une pipe_, the devil himself is not an uglier\ncustomer than I can be if people annoy me, or if I don't happen to take to them; and you may just as well\nknow at once that I think no more of killing a man than of that,\" and he spat before him as he spoke.\n\n\"Only when it is absolutely necessary to do so, I do my best to kill him properly. I am what you call an\nartist. I have read Benvenuto Cellini's _Memoirs_, such as you see me; and, what is more, in Italian: A\nfine-spirited fellow he was! From him I learned to follow the example set us by Providence, who strikes\nus down at random, and to admire the beautiful whenever and wherever it is found. And, setting other\nquestions aside, is it not a glorious part to play, when you pit yourself against mankind, and the luck is on\nyour side? I have thought a good deal about the constitution of your present social Dis-order. A duel is\ndownright childish, my boy! utter nonsense and folly! When one of two living men must be got out of the\nway, none but an idiot would leave chance to decide which it is to be; and in a duel it is a toss-up--heads\nor tails--and there you are! Now I, for instance, can hit the ace in the middle of a card five times running,\nsend one bullet after another through the same hole, and at thirty-five paces, moreover! With that little\naccomplishment you might think yourself certain of killing your man, mightn't you. Well, I have fired, at\ntwenty paces, and missed, and the rogue who had never handled a pistol in his life--look here!\"--(he\nunbuttoned his waistcoat and exposed his chest, covered, like a bear's back, with a shaggy fell; the student\ngave a startled shudder)--\"he was a raw lad, but he made his mark on me,\" the extraordinary man went on,\ndrawing Rastignac's fingers over a deep scar on his breast. But that happened when I myself was a mere\nboy; I was one-and-twenty then (your age), and I had some beliefs left--in a woman's love, and in a pack\nof rubbish that you will be over head and ears in directly. You and I were to have fought just now, weren't\nwe? You might have killed me. Suppose that I were put under the earth, where would you be? You would\nhave to clear out of this, go to Switzerland, draw on papa's purse --and he has none too much in it as it is.\nI mean to open your eyes to your real position, that is what I am going to do: but I shall do it from the\npoint of view of a man who, after studying the world very closely, sees that there are but two\nalternatives--stupid obedience or revolt. I obey nobody; is that clear? Now, do you know how much you\nwill want at the pace you are going? A million; and promptly, too, or that little head of ours will be\nswaying to and fro in the drag-nets at Saint-Cloud, while we are gone to find out whether or no there is a\nSupreme Being. I will put you in the way of that million.\"\nHe stopped for a moment and looked at Eugene.\n\"Aha! you do not look so sourly at papa Vautrin now! At the mention of the million you look like\na young girl when somebody has said, 'I will come for you this evening!' and she betakes herself to her\ntoilette as a cat licks its whiskers over a saucer of milk. All right. Come, now, let us go into the question,\nyoung man; all between ourselves, you know. We have a papa and mamma down yonder, a great-aunt,\ntwo sisters (aged eighteen and seventeen), two young brothers (one fifteen, and the other ten), that is\nabout the roll-call of the crew. The aunt brings up the two sisters; the cure comes and teaches the boys\nLatin. Boiled chestnuts are oftener on the table than white bread. Papa makes a suit of clothes last a long\nwhile; if mamma has a different dress winter and summer, it is about as much as she has; the sisters\nmanage as best they can. I know all about it; I have lived in the south.\n\"That is how things are at home. They send you twelve hundred francs a year, and the whole\nproperty only brings in three thousand francs all told. We have a cook and a manservant; papa is a baron,\nand we must keep up appearances. Then we have our ambitions; we are connected with the Beauseants,\nand we go afoot through the streets; we want to be rich, and we have not a penny; we eat Mme. Vauquer's\nmesses, and we like grand dinners in the Faubourg Saint-Germain; we sleep on a truckle-bed, and dream\nof a mansion! I do not blame you for wanting these things. What sort of men do the women run after?\nMen of ambition. Men of ambition have stronger frames, their blood is richer in iron, their hearts are\nwarmer than those of ordinary men. Women feel that when their power is greatest, they look their best,\nand that those are their happiest hours; they like power in men, and prefer the strongest even if it is a\npower that may be their own destruction. I am going to make an inventory of your desires in order to put\nthe question at issue before you. Here it is:--\n\n\"We are as hungry as a wolf, and those newly-cut teeth of ours are sharp; what are we to do to\nkeep the pot boiling? In the first place, we have the Code to browse upon; it is not amusing, and we are\nnone the wiser for it, but that cannot be helped. So far so good. We mean to make an advocate of\nourselves with a prospect of one day being made President of a Court of Assize, when we shall send poor\ndevils, our betters, to the galleys with a T.F.[*] on their shoulders, so that the rich may be convinced that\nthey can sleep in peace. There is no fun in that; and you are a long while coming to it; for, to begin with,\nthere are two years of nauseous drudgery in Paris, we see all the lollipops that we long for out of our\nreach. It is tiresome to want things and never to have them. If you were a pallid creature of the mollusk\norder, you would have nothing to fear, but it is different when you have the hot blood of a lion and are\nready to get into a score of scrapes every day of your life. This is the ghastliest form of torture known in\nthis inferno of God's making, and you will give in to it. Or suppose that you are a good boy, drink nothing\nstronger than milk, and bemoan your hard lot; you, with your generous nature, will endure hardships that\nwould drive a dog mad, and make a start, after long waiting, as deputy to some rascal or other in a hole of\na place where the Government will fling you a thousand francs a year like the scraps that are thrown to\nthe butcher's dog. Bark at thieves, plead the cause of the rich, send men of heart to the guillotine, that is\nyour work! Many thanks! If you have no influence, you may rot in your provincial tribunal. At thirty you\nwill be a Justice with twelve hundred francs a year (if you have not flung off the gown for good before\nthen). By the time you are forty you may look to marry a miller's daughter, an heiress with some six\nthousand livres a year. Much obliged! If you have influence, you may possibly be a Public Prosecutor by\nthe time you are thirty; with a salary of a thousand crowns, you could look to marry the mayor's daughter.\nSome petty piece of political trickery, such as mistaking Villele for Manuel in a bulletin (the names\nrhyme, and that quiets your conscience), and you will probably be a Procureur General by the time you\nare forty, with a chance of becoming a deputy. Please to observe, my dear boy, that our conscience will\nhave been a little damaged in the process, and that we shall endure twenty years of drudgery and hidden\npoverty, and that our sisters are wearing Dian's livery. I have the honor to call your attention to another\nfact: to wit, that there are but twenty Procureurs Generaux at a time in all France, while there are some\ntwenty thousand of you young men who aspire to that elevated position; that there are some mountebanks\namong you who would sell their family to screw their fortunes a peg higher. If this sort of thing sickens\nyou, try another course. The Baron de Rastignac thinks of becoming an advocate, does he? There's a nice\nprospect for you! Ten years of drudgery straight away. You are obliged to live at the rate of a thousand\nfrancs a month; you must have a library of law books, live in chambers, go into society, go down on your\nknees to ask a solicitor for briefs, lick the dust off the floor of the Palais de Justice. If this kind of business\nled to anything, I should not say no; but just give me the names of five advocates here in Paris who by the\ntime that they are fifty are making fifty thousand francs a year! Bah! I would sooner turn pirate on the\nhigh seas than have my soul shrivel up inside me like that. How will you find the capital? There is but one\nway, marry a woman who has money. There is no fun in it. Have you a mind to marry? You hang a stone\naround your neck; for if you marry for money, what becomes of our exalted notions of honor and so\nforth? You might as well fly in the face of social conventions at once. Is it nothing to crawl like a serpent\nbefore your wife, to lick her mother's feet, to descend to dirty actions that would sicken\nswine--faugh!--never mind if you at least make your fortune. But you will be as doleful as a dripstone if\nyou marry for money. It is better to wrestle with men than to wrangle at home with your wife. You are at\nthe crossway of the roads of life, my boy; choose your way.\n[*] Travaux forces, forced labour.\n\"But you have chosen already. You have gone to see your cousin of Beauseant, and you have had\nan inkling of luxury; you have been to Mme. de Restaud's house, and in Father Goriot's daughter you\nhave seen a glimpse of the Parisienne for the first time. That day you came back with a word written on\nyour forehead. I knew it, I could read it--'_Success_!' Yes, success at any price. 'Bravo,' said I to myself,\n\n'here is the sort of fellow for me.' You wanted money. Where was it all to come from? You have drained\nyour sisters' little hoard (all brothers sponge more or less on their sisters). Those fifteen hundred francs of\nyours (got together, God knows how! in a country where there are more chestnuts than five-franc pieces)\nwill slip away like soldiers after pillage. And, then, what will you do? Shall you begin to work? Work, or\nwhat you understand by work at this moment, means, for a man of Poiret's calibre, an old age in Mamma\nVauquer's lodging-house. There are fifty thousand young men in your position at this moment, all bent as\nyou are on solving one and the same problem --how to acquire a fortune rapidly. You are but a unit in that\naggregate. You can guess, therefore, what efforts you must make, how desperate the struggle is. There are\nnot fifty thousand good positions for you; you must fight and devour one another like spiders in a pot. Do\nyou know how a man makes his way here? By brilliant genius or by skilful corruption. You must either\ncut your way through these masses of men like a cannon ball, or steal among them like a plague. Honesty\nis nothing to the purpose. Men bow before the power of genius; they hate it, and try to slander it, because\ngenius does not divide the spoil; but if genius persists, they bow before it. To sum it all up in a phrase, if\nthey fail to smother genius in the mud, they fall on their knees and worship it. Corruption is a great power\nin the world, and talent is scarce. So corruption is the weapon of superfluous mediocrity; you will be\nmade to feel the point of it everywhere. You will see women who spend more than ten thousand francs a\nyear on dress, while their husband's salary (his whole income) is six thousand francs. You will see\nofficials buying estates on twelve thousand francs a year. You will see women who sell themselves body\nand soul to drive in a carriage belonging to the son of a peer of France, who has a right to drive in the\nmiddle rank at Longchamp. You have seen that poor simpleton of a Goriot obliged to meet a bill with his\ndaughter's name at the back of it, though her husband has fifty thousand francs a year. I defy you to walk\na couple of yards anywhere in Paris without stumbling on some infernal complication. I'll bet my head to\na head of that salad that you will stir up a hornet's nest by taking a fancy to the first young, rich, and\npretty woman you meet. They are all dodging the law, all at loggerheads with their husbands. If I were to\nbegin to tell you all that vanity or necessity (virtue is not often mixed up in it, you may be sure), all that\nvanity and necessity drive them to do for lovers, finery, housekeeping, or children, I should never come to\nan end. So an honest man is the common enemy.\n\"But do you know what an honest man is? Here, in Paris, an honest man is the man who keeps his\nown counsel, and will not divide the plunder. I am not speaking now of those poor bond-slaves who do\nthe work of the world without a reward for their toil--God Almighty's outcasts, I call them. Among them,\nI grant you, is virtue in all the flower of its stupidity, but poverty is no less their portion. At this moment,\nI think I see the long faces those good folk would pull if God played a practical joke on them and stayed\naway at the Last Judgment.\n\"Well, then, if you mean to make a fortune quickly, you must either be rich to begin with, or\nmake people believe that you are rich. It is no use playing here except for high stakes; once take to low\nplay, it is all up with you. If in the scores of professions that are open to you, there are ten men who rise\nvery rapidly, people are sure to call them thieves. You can draw your own conclusions. Such is life. It is\nno cleaner than a kitchen; it reeks like a kitchen; and if you mean to cook your dinner, you must expect to\nsoil your hands; the real art is in getting them clean again, and therein lies the whole morality of our\nepoch. If I take this tone in speaking of the world to you, I have the right to do so; I know it well. Do you\nthink that I am blaming it? Far from it; the world has always been as it is now. Moralists' strictures will\nnever change it. Mankind are not perfect, but one age is more or less hypocritical than another, and then\nsimpletons say that its morality is high or low. I do not think that the rich are any worse than the poor;\nman is much the same, high or low, or wherever he is. In a million of these human cattle there may be half\na score of bold spirits who rise above the rest, above the laws; I am one of them. And you, if you are\ncleverer than your fellows, make straight to your end, and hold your head high. But you must lay your\naccount with envy and slander and mediocrity, and every man's hand will be against you. Napoleon met\n\nwith a Minister of War, Aubry by name, who all but sent him to the colonies.\n\"Feel your pulse. Think whether you can get up morning after morning, strengthened in\nyesterday's purpose. In that case I will make you an offer that no one would decline. Listen attentively.\nYou see, I have an idea of my own. My idea is to live a patriarchal life on a vast estate, say a hundred\nthousand acres, somewhere in the Southern States of America. I mean to be a planter, to have slaves, to\nmake a few snug millions by selling my cattle, timber, and tobacco; I want to live an absolute monarch,\nand to do just as I please; to lead such a life as no one here in these squalid dens of lath and plaster ever\nimagines. I am a great poet; I do not write my poems, I feel them, and act them. At this moment I have\nfifty thousand francs, which might possibly buy forty negroes. I want two hundred thousand francs,\nbecause I want to have two hundred negroes to carry out my notions of the patriarachal life properly.\nNegroes, you see, are like a sort of family ready grown, and there are no inquisitive public prosecutors out\nthere to interfere with you. That investment in ebony ought to mean three or four million francs in ten\nyears' time. If I am successful, no one will ask me who I am. I shall be Mr. Four Millions, an American\ncitizen. I shall be fifty years old by then, and sound and hearty still; I shall enjoy life after my own\nfashion. In two words, if I find you an heiress with a million, will you give me two hundred thousand\nfrancs? Twenty per cent commission, eh? Is that too much? Your little wife will be very much in love\nwith you. Once married, you will show signs of uneasiness and remorse; for a couple of weeks you will\nbe depressed. Then, some night after sundry grimacings, comes the confession, between two kisses, 'Two\nhundred thousand francs of debts, my darling!' This sort of farce is played every day in Paris, and by\nyoung men of the highest fashion. When a young wife has given her heart, she will not refuse her purse.\nPerhaps you are thinking that you will lose the money for good? Not you. You will make two hundred\nthousand francs again by some stroke of business. With your capital and your brains you should be able\nto accumulate as large a fortune as you could wish. _Ergo_, in six months you will have made your own\nfortune, and our old friend Vautrin's, and made an amiable woman very happy, to say nothing of your\npeople at home, who must blow on their fingers to warm them, in the winter, for lack of firewood. You\nneed not be surprised at my proposal, nor at the demand I make. Forty-seven out of every sixty great\nmatches here in Paris are made after just such a bargain as this. The Chamber of Notaries compels my\ngentleman to----\"\n\"What must I do?\" said Rastignac, eagerly interrupting Vautrin's speech.\n\"Next to nothing,\" returned the other, with a slight involuntary movement, the suppressed\nexultation of the angler when he feels a bite at the end of his line. \"Follow me carefully! The heart of a\ngirl whose life is wretched and unhappy is a sponge that will thirstily absorb love; a dry sponge that\nswells at the first drop of sentiment. If you pay court to a young girl whose existence is a compound of\nloneliness, despair, and poverty, and who has no suspicion that she will come into a fortune, good Lord! it\nis quint and quatorze at piquet; it is knowing the numbers of the lottery before-hand; it is speculating in\nthe funds when you have news from a sure source; it is building up a marriage on an indestructible\nfoundation. The girl may come in for millions, and she will fling them, as if they were so many pebbles,\nat your feet. 'Take it, my beloved! Take it, Alfred, Adolphe, Eugene!' or whoever it was that showed his\nsense by sacrificing himself for her. And as for sacrificing himself, this is how I understand it. You sell a\ncoat that is getting shabby, so that you can take her to the _Cadran bleu_, treat her to mushrooms on toast,\nand then go to the Ambigu-Comique in the evening; you pawn your watch to buy her a shawl. I need not\nremind you of the fiddle-faddle sentimentality that goes down so well with all women; you spill a few\ndrops of water on your stationery, for instance; those are the tears you shed while far away from her. You\nlook to me as if you were perfectly acquainted with the argot of the heart. Paris, you see, is like a forest in\nthe New World, where you have to deal with a score of varieties of savages--Illinois and Hurons, who\nlive on the proceed of their social hunting. You are a hunter of millions; you set your snares; you use\n\nlures and nets; there are many ways of hunting. Some hunt heiresses, others a legacy; some fish for souls,\nyet others sell their clients, bound hand and foot. Every one who comes back from the chase with his\ngame-bag well filled meets with a warm welcome in good society. In justice to this hospitable part of the\nworld, it must be said that you have to do with the most easy and good-natured of great cities. If the proud\naristocracies of the rest of Europe refuse admittance among their ranks to a disreputable millionaire, Paris\nstretches out a hand to him, goes to his banquets, eats his dinners, and hobnobs with his infamy.\"\n\"But where is such a girl to be found?\" asked Eugene.\n\"Under your eyes; she is yours already.\"\n\"Mlle. Victorine?\"\n\"Precisely.\"\n\"And what was that you said?\"\n\"She is in love with you already, your little Baronne de Rastignac!\"\n\"She has not a penny,\" Eugene continued, much mystified.\n\"Ah! now we are coming to it! Just another word or two, and it will all be clear enough. Her\nfather, Taillefer, is an old scoundrel; it is said that he murdered one of his friends at the time of the\nRevolution. He is one of your comedians that sets up to have opinions of his own. He is a banker--senior\npartner in the house of Frederic Taillefer and Company. He has one son, and means to leave all he has to\nthe boy, to the prejudice of Victorine. For my part, I don't like to see injustice of this sort. I am like Don\nQuixote, I have a fancy for defending the weak against the strong. If it should please God to take that\nyouth away from him, Taillefer would have only his daughter left; he would want to leave his money to\nsome one or other; an absurd notion, but it is only human nature, and he is not likely to have any more\nchildren, as I know. Victorine is gentle and amiable; she will soon twist her father round her fingers, and\nset his head spinning like a German top by plying him with sentiment! She will be too much touched by\nyour devotion to forget you; you will marry her. I mean to play Providence for you, and Providence is to\ndo my will. I have a friend whom I have attached closely to myself, a colonel in the Army of the Loire,\nwho has just been transferred into the _garde royale_. He has taken my advice and turned ultra-royalist;\nhe is not one of those fools who never change their opinions. Of all pieces of advice, my cherub, I would\ngive you this--don't stick to your opinions any more than to your words. If any one asks you for them, let\nhim have them --at a price. A man who prides himself on going in a straight line through life is an idiot\nwho believes in infallibility. There are no such things as principles; there are only events, and there are no\nlaws but those of expediency: a man of talent accepts events and the circumstances in which he finds\nhimself, and turns everything to his own ends. If laws and principles were fixed and invariable, nations\nwould not change them as readily as we change our shirts. The individual is not obliged to be more\nparticular than the nation. A man whose services to France have been of the very slightest is a fetich\nlooked on with superstitious awe because he has always seen everything in red; but he is good, at the\nmost, to be put into the Museum of Arts and Crafts, among the automatic machines, and labeled La\nFayette; while the prince at whom everybody flings a stone, the man who despises humanity so much that\nhe spits as many oaths as he is asked for in the face of humanity, saved France from being torn in pieces\nat the Congress of Vienna; and they who should have given him laurels fling mud at him. Oh! I know\nsomething of affairs, I can tell you; I have the secrets of many men! Enough. When I find three minds in\nagreement as to the application of a principle, I shall have a fixed and immovable opinion--I shall have to\n\nwait a long while first. In the Tribunals you will not find three judges of the same opinion on a single\npoint of law. To return to the man I was telling you of. He would crucify Jesus Christ again, if I bade him.\nAt a word from his old chum Vautrin he will pick a quarrel with a scamp that will not send so much as\nfive francs to his sister, poor girl, and\" (here Vautrin rose to his feet and stood like a fencing-master about\nto lunge)--\"turn him off into the dark!\" he added.\n\"How frightful!\" said Eugene. \"You do not really mean it? M. Vautrin, you are joking!\"\n\"There! there! Keep cool!\" said the other. \"Don't behave like a baby. But if you find any\namusement in it, be indignant, flare up! Say that I am a scoundrel, a rascal, a rogue, a bandit; but do not\ncall me a blackleg nor a spy! There, out with it, fire away! I forgive you; it is quite natural at your age. I\nwas like that myself once. Only remember this, you will do worse things yourself some day. You will flirt\nwith some pretty woman and take her money. You have thought of that, of course,\" said Vautrin, \"for\nhow are you to succeed unless love is laid under contribution? There are no two ways about virtue, my\ndear student; it either is, or it is not. Talk of doing penance for your sins! It is a nice system of business,\nwhen you pay for your crime by an act of contrition! You seduce a woman that you may set your foot on\nsuch and such a rung of the social ladder; you sow dissension among the children of a family; you\ndescend, in short, to every base action that can be committed at home or abroad, to gain your own ends\nfor your own pleasure or your profit; and can you imagine that these are acts of faith, hope, or charity?\nHow is it that a dandy, who in a night has robbed a boy of half his fortune, gets only a couple of months\nin prison; while a poor devil who steals a banknote for a thousand francs, with aggravating circumstances,\nis condemned to penal servitude? Those are your laws. Not a single provision but lands you in some\nabsurdity. That man with yellow gloves and a golden tongue commits many a murder; he sheds no blood,\nbut he drains his victim's veins as surely; a desperado forces open a door with a crowbar, dark deeds both\nof them! You yourself will do every one of those things that I suggest to you to-day, bar the bloodshed.\nDo you believe that there is any absolute standard in this world? Despise mankind and find out the\nmeshes that you can slip through in the net of the Code. The secret of a great success for which you are at\na loss to account is a crime that has never been found out, because it was properly executed.\"\n\"Silence, sir! I will not hear any more; you make me doubt myself. At this moment my sentiments\nare all my science.\"\n\"Just as you please, my fine fellow; I did think you were so weak-minded,\" said Vautrin, \"I shall\nsay no more about it. One last word, however,\" and he looked hard at the student--\"you have my secret,\"\nhe said.\n\"A young man who refuses your offer knows that he must forget it.\"\n\"Quite right, quite right; I am glad to hear you say so. Somebody else might not be so scrupulous,\nyou see. Keep in mind what I want to do for you. I will give you a fortnight. The offer is still open.\"\n\"What a head of iron the man has!\" said Eugene to himself, as he watched Vautrin walk\nunconcernedly away with his cane under his arm. \"Yet Mme. de Beauseant said as much more gracefully;\nhe has only stated the case in cruder language. He would tear my heart with claws of steel. What made me\nthink of going to Mme. de Nucingen? He guessed my motives before I knew them myself. To sum it up,\nthat outlaw has told me more about virtue than all I have learned from men and books. If virtue admits of\nno compromises, I have certainly robbed my sisters,\" he said, throwing down the bags on the table.\nHe sat down again and fell, unconscious of his surroundings, into deep thought.\n\n\"To be faithful to an ideal of virtue! A heroic martyrdom! Pshaw! every one believes in virtue,\nbut who is virtuous? Nations have made an idol of Liberty, but what nation on the face of the earth is\nfree? My youth is still like a blue and cloudless sky. If I set myself to obtain wealth or power, does it\nmean that I must make up my mind to lie, and fawn, and cringe, and swagger, and flatter, and dissemble?\nTo consent to be the servant of others who have likewise fawned, and lied, and flattered? Must I cringe to\nthem before I can hope to be their accomplice? Well, then, I decline. I mean to work nobly and with a\nsingle heart. I will work day and night; I will owe my fortune to nothing but my own exertions. It may be\nthe slowest of all roads to success, but I shall lay my head on the pillow at night untroubled by evil\nthoughts. Is there a greater thing than this--to look back over your life and know that it is stainless as a\nlily? I and my life are like a young man and his betrothed. Vautrin has put before me all that comes after\nten years of marriage. The devil! my head is swimming. I do not want to think at all; the heart is a sure\nguide.\"\nEugene was roused from his musings by the voice of the stout Sylvie, who announced that the\ntailor had come, and Eugene therefore made his appearance before the man with the two money bags, and\nwas not ill pleased that it should be so. When he had tried on his dress suit, he put on his new morning\ncostume, which completely metamorphosed him.\n\"I am quite equal to M. de Trailles,\" he said to himself. \"In short, I look like a gentleman.\"\n\"You asked me, sir, if I knew the houses where Mme. de Nucingen goes,\" Father Goriot's voice\nspoke from the doorway of Eugene's room.\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"Very well then, she is going to the Marechale Carigliano's ball on Monday. If you can manage to\nbe there, I shall hear from you whether my two girls enjoyed themselves, and how they were dressed, and\nall about it in fact.\"\n\"How did you find that out, my good Goriot?\" said Eugene, putting a chair by the fire for his\nvisitor.\n\"Her maid told me. I hear all about their doings from Therese and Constance,\" he added gleefully.\nThe old man looked like a lover who is still young enough to be made happy by the discovery of\nsome little stratagem which brings him information of his lady-love without her knowledge.\n\"_You_ will see them both!\" he said, giving artless expression to a pang of jealousy.\n\"I do not know,\" answered Eugene. \"I will go to Mme. de Beauseant and ask her for an\nintroduction to the Marechale.\"\nEugene felt a thrill of pleasure at the thought of appearing before the Vicomtesse, dressed as\nhenceforward he always meant to be. The \"abysses of the human heart,\" in the moralists' phrase, are only\ninsidious thoughts, involuntary promptings of personal interest. The instinct of enjoyment turns the scale;\nthose rapid changes of purpose which have furnished the text for so much rhetoric are calculations\nprompted by the hope of pleasure. Rastignac beholding himself well dressed and impeccable as to gloves\nand boots, forgot his virtuous resolutions. Youth, moreover, when bent upon wrongdoing does not dare to\nbehold himself in the mirror of consciousness; mature age has seen itself; and therein lies the whole\n\ndifference between these two phases of life.\nA friendship between Eugene and his neighbor, Father Goriot, had been growing up for several\ndays past. This secret friendship and the antipathy that the student had begun to entertain for Vautrin\narose from the same psychological causes. The bold philosopher who shall investigate the effects of\nmental action upon the physical world will doubtless find more than one proof of the material nature of\nour sentiments in other animals. What physiognomist is as quick to discern character as a dog is to\ndiscover from a stranger's face whether this is a friend or no? Those by-words--\"atoms,\" \"affinities\"--are\nfacts surviving in modern languages for the confusion of philosophic wiseacres who amuse themselves by\nwinnowing the chaff of language to find its grammatical roots. We _feel_ that we are loved. Our\nsentiments make themselves felt in everything, even at a great distance. A letter is a living soul, and so\nfaithful an echo of the voice that speaks in it, that finer natures look upon a letter as one of love's most\nprecious treasures. Father Goriot's affection was of the instinctive order, a canine affection raised to a\nsublime pitch; he had scented compassion in the air, and the kindly respect and youthful sympathy in the\nstudent's heart. This friendship had, however, scarcely reached the stage at which confidences are made.\nThough Eugene had spoken of his wish to meet Mme. de Nucingen, it was not because he counted on the\nold man to introduce him to her house, for he hoped that his own audacity might stand him in good stead.\nAll that Father Goriot had said as yet about his daughters had referred to the remarks that the student had\nmade so freely in public on that day of the two visits.\n\"How could you think that Mme. de Restaud bore you a grudge for mentioning my name?\" he\nhad said on the day following that scene at dinner. \"My daughters are very fond of me; I am a happy\nfather; but my sons-in-law have behaved badly to me, and rather than make trouble between my darlings\nand their husbands, I choose to see my daughters secretly. Fathers who can see their daughters at any time\nhave no idea of all the pleasure that all this mystery gives me; I cannot always see mine when I wish, do\nyou understand? So when it is fine I walk out in the Champs-Elysees, after finding out from their\nwaiting-maids whether my daughters mean to go out. I wait near the entrance; my heart beats fast when\nthe carriages begin to come; I admire them in their dresses, and as they pass they give me a little smile,\nand it seems as if everything was lighted up for me by a ray of bright sunlight. I wait, for they always go\nback the same way, and then I see them again; the fresh air has done them good and brought color into\ntheir cheeks; all about me people say, 'What a beautiful woman that is!' and it does my heart good to hear\nthem.\n\"Are they not my own flesh and blood? I love the very horses that draw them; I envy the little\nlap-dog on their knees. Their happiness is my life. Every one loves after his own fashion, and mine does\nno one any harm; why should people trouble their heads about me? I am happy in my own way. Is there\nany law against going to see my girls in the evening when they are going out to a ball? And what a\ndisappointment it is when I get there too late, and am told that 'Madame has gone out!' Once I waited till\nthree o'clock in the morning for Nasie; I had not seen her for two whole days. I was so pleased, that it was\nalmost too much for me! Please do not speak of me unless it is to say how good my daughters are to me.\nThey are always wanting to heap presents upon me, but I will not have it. 'Just keep your money,' I tell\nthem. 'What should I do with it? I want nothing.' And what am I, sir, after all? An old carcase, whose soul\nis always where my daughters are. When you have seen Mme. de Nucingen, tell me which you like the\nmost,\" said the old man after a moment's pause, while Eugene put the last touches to his toilette. The\nstudent was about to go out to walk in the Garden of the Tuileries until the hour when he could venture to\nappear in Mme. de Beauseant's drawing-room.\nThat walk was a turning-point in Eugene's career. Several women noticed him; he looked so\nhandsome, so young, and so well dressed. This almost admiring attention gave a new turn to his thoughts.\n\nHe forgot his sisters and the aunt who had robbed herself for him; he no longer remembered his own\nvirtuous scruples. He had seen hovering above his head the fiend so easy to mistake for an angel, the\nDevil with rainbow wings, who scatters rubies, and aims his golden shafts at palace fronts, who invests\nwomen with purple, and thrones with a glory that dazzles the eyes of fools till they forget the simple\norigins of royal dominion; he had heard the rustle of that Vanity whose tinsel seems to us to be the\nsymbol of power. However cynical Vautrin's words had been, they had made an impression on his mind,\nas the sordid features of the old crone who whispers, \"A lover, and gold in torrents,\" remain engraven on\na young girl's memory.\nEugene lounged about the walks till it was nearly five o'clock, then he went to Mme. de\nBeauseant, and received one of the terrible blows against which young hearts are defenceless. Hitherto the\nVicomtesse had received him with the kindly urbanity, the bland grace of manner that is the result of fine\nbreeding, but is only complete when it comes from the heart.\nTo-day Mme. de Beauseant bowed constrainedly, and spoke curtly:\n\"M. de Rastignac, I cannot possibly see you, at least not at this moment. I am engaged . . .\"\nAn observer, and Rastignac instantly became an observer, could read the whole history, the\ncharacter and customs of caste, in the phrase, in the tones of her voice, in her glance and bearing. He\ncaught a glimpse of the iron hand beneath the velvet glove--the personality, the egoism beneath the\nmanner, the wood beneath the varnish. In short, he heard that unmistakable I THE KING that issues from\nthe plumed canopy of the throne, and finds its last echo under the crest of the simplest gentleman.\nEugene had trusted too implicitly to the generosity of a woman; he could not believe in her\nhaughtiness. Like all the unfortunate, he had subscribed, in all good faith, the generous compact which\nshould bind the benefactor to the recipient, and the first article in that bond, between two large-hearted\nnatures, is a perfect equality. The kindness which knits two souls together is as rare, as divine, and as little\nunderstood as the passion of love, for both love and kindness are the lavish generosity of noble natures.\nRastignac was set upon going to the Duchesse de Carigliano's ball, so he swallowed down this rebuff.\n\"Madame,\" he faltered out, \"I would not have come to trouble you about a trifling matter; be so\nkind as to permit me to see you later, I can wait.\"\n\"Very well, come and dine with me,\" she said, a little confused by the harsh way in which she had\nspoken, for this lady was as genuinely kind-hearted as she was high-born.\nEugene was touched by this sudden relenting, but none the less he said to himself as he went\naway, \"Crawl in the dust, put up with every kind of treatment. What must the rest of the world be like\nwhen one of the kindest of women forgets all her promises of befriending me in a moment, and tosses me\naside like an old shoe? So it is every one for himself? It is true that her house is not a shop, and I have put\nmyself in the wrong by needing her help. You should cut your way through the world like a cannon ball,\nas Vautrin said.\"\nBut the student's bitter thoughts were soon dissipated by the pleasure which he promised himself\nin this dinner with the Vicomtesse. Fate seemed to determine that the smallest accidents in his life should\ncombine to urge him into a career, which the terrible sphinx of the Maison Vauquer had described as a\nfield of battle where you must either slay or be slain, and cheat to avoid being cheated. You leave your\nconscience and your heart at the barriers, and wear a mask on entering into this game of grim earnest,\n\nwhere, as in ancient Sparta, you must snatch your prize without being detected if you would deserve the\ncrown.\nOn his return he found the Vicomtesse gracious and kindly, as she had always been to him. They\nwent together to the dining-room, where the Vicomte was waiting for his wife. In the time of the\nRestoration the luxury of the table was carried, as is well known, to the highest degree, and M. de\nBeauseant, like many jaded men of the world, had few pleasures left but those of good cheer; in this\nmatter, in fact, he was a gourmand of the schools of Louis XVIII. and of the Duc d'Escars, and luxury was\nsupplemented by splendor. Eugene, dining for the first time in a house where the traditions of grandeur\nhad descended through many generations, had never seen any spectacle like this that now met his eyes. In\nthe time of the Empire, balls had always ended with a supper, because the officers who took part in them\nmust be fortified for immediate service, and even in Paris might be called upon to leave the ballroom for\nthe battlefield. This arrangement had gone out of fashion under the Monarchy, and Eugene had so far\nonly been asked to dances. The self-possession which pre-eminently distinguished him in later life\nalready stood him in good stead, and he did not betray his amazement. Yet as he saw for the first time the\nfinely wrought silver plate, the completeness of every detail, the sumptuous dinner, noiselessly served, it\nwas difficult for such an ardent imagination not to prefer this life of studied and refined luxury to the\nhardships of the life which he had chosen only that morning.\nHis thoughts went back for a moment to the lodging-house, and with a feeling of profound\nloathing, he vowed to himself that at New Year he would go; prompted at least as much by a desire to live\namong cleaner surroundings as by a wish to shake off Vautrin, whose huge hand he seemed to feel on his\nshoulder at that moment. When you consider the numberless forms, clamorous or mute, that corruption\ntakes in Paris, common-sense begins to wonder what mental aberration prompted the State to establish\ngreat colleges and schools there, and assemble young men in the capital; how it is that pretty women are\nrespected, or that the gold coin displayed in the money-changer's wooden saucers does not take to itself\nwings in the twinkling of an eye; and when you come to think further, how comparatively few cases of\ncrime there are, and to count up the misdemeanors committed by youth, is there not a certain amount of\nrespect due to these patient Tantaluses who wrestle with themselves and nearly always come off\nvictorious? The struggles of the poor student in Paris, if skilfully drawn, would furnish a most dramatic\npicture of modern civilization.\nIn vain Mme. de Beauseant looked at Eugene as if asking him to speak; the student was\ntongue-tied in the Vicomte's presence.\n\"Are you going to take me to the Italiens this evening?\" the Vicomtesse asked her husband.\n\"You cannot doubt that I should obey you with pleasure,\" he answered, and there was a sarcastic\ntinge in his politeness which Eugene did not detect, \"but I ought to go to meet some one at the Varietes.\"\n\"His mistress,\" said she to herself.\n\"Then, is not Ajuda coming for you this evening?\" inquired the Vicomte.\n\"No,\" she answered, petulantly.\n\"Very well, then, if you really must have an arm, take that of M. de Rastignac.\"\nThe Vicomtess turned to Eugene with a smile.\n\n\"That would be a very compromising step for you,\" she said.\n\"'A Frenchman loves danger, because in danger there is glory,' to quote M. de Chateaubriand,\"\nsaid Rastignac, with a bow.\nA few moments later he was sitting beside Mme. de Beauseant in a brougham, that whirled them\nthrough the streets of Paris to a fashionable theatre. It seemed to him that some fairy magic had suddenly\ntransported him into a box facing the stage. All the lorgnettes of the house were pointed at him as he\nentered, and at the Vicomtesse in her charming toilette. He went from enchantment to enchantment.\n\"You must talk to me, you know,\" said Mme. de Beauseant. \"Ah! look! There is Mme. de\nNucingen in the third box from ours. Her sister and M. de Trailles are on the other side.\"\nThe Vicomtesse glanced as she spoke at the box where Mlle. de Rochefide should have been; M.\nd'Ajuda was not there, and Mme. de Beauseant's face lighted up in a marvelous way.\n\"She is charming,\" said Eugene, after looking at Mme. de Nucingen.\n\"She has white eyelashes.\"\n\"Yes, but she has such a pretty slender figure!\"\n\"Her hands are large.\"\n\"Such beautiful eyes!\"\n\"Her face is long.\"\n\"Yes, but length gives distinction.\"\n\"It is lucky for her that she has some distinction in her face. Just see how she fidgets with her\nopera-glass! The Goriot blood shows itself in every movement,\" said the Vicomtesse, much to Eugene's\nastonishment.\nIndeed, Mme. de Beauseant seemed to be engaged in making a survey of the house, and to be\nunconscious of Mme. Nucingen's existence; but no movement made by the latter was lost upon the\nVicomtesse. The house was full of the loveliest women in Paris, so that Delphine de Nucingen was not a\nlittle flattered to receive the undivided attention of Mme. de Beauseant's young, handsome, and\nwell-dressed cousin, who seemed to have no eyes for any one else.\n\"If you look at her so persistently, you will make people talk, M. de Rastignac. You will never\nsucceed if you fling yourself at any one's head like that.\"\n\"My dear cousin,\" said Eugene, \"you have protected me indeed so far, and now if you would\ncomplete your work, I only ask of you a favor which will cost you but little, and be of very great service\nto me. I have lost my heart.\"\n\"Already!\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\"And to that woman!\"\n\"How could I aspire to find any one else to listen to me?\" he asked, with a keen glance at his\ncousin. \"Her Grace the Duchesse de Carigliano is a friend of the Duchesse de Berri,\" he went on, after a\npause; \"you are sure to see her, will you be so kind as to present me to her, and to take me to her ball on\nMonday? I shall meet Mme. de Nucingen there, and enter into my first skirmish.\"\n\"Willingly,\" she said. \"If you have a liking for her already, your affairs of the heart are like to\nprosper. That is de Marsay over there in the Princesse Galathionne's box. Mme. de Nucingen is racked\nwith jealousy. There is no better time for approaching a woman, especially if she happens to be a banker's\nwife. All those ladies of the Chaussee-d'Antin love revenge.\"\n\"Then, what would you do yourself in such a case?\"\n\"I should suffer in silence.\"\nAt this point the Marquis d'Ajuda appeared in Mme. de Beauseant's box.\n\"I have made a muddle of my affairs to come to you,\" he said, \"and I am telling you about it, so\nthat it may not be a sacrifice.\"\nEugene saw the glow of joy on the Vicomtesse's face, and knew that this was love, and learned\nthe difference between love and the affectations of Parisian coquetry. He admired his cousin, grew mute,\nand yielded his place to M. d'Ajuda with a sigh.\n\"How noble, how sublime a woman is when she loves like that!\" he said to himself. \"And _he_\ncould forsake her for a doll! Oh! how could any one forsake her?\"\nThere was a boy's passionate indignation in his heart. He could have flung himself at Mme. de\nBeauseant's feet; he longed for the power of the devil if he could snatch her away and hide her in his\nheart, as an eagle snatches up some white yeanling from the plains and bears it to its eyrie. It was\nhumiliating to him to think that in all this gallery of fair pictures he had not one picture of his own. \"To\nhave a mistress and an almost royal position is a sign of power,\" he said to himself. And he looked at\nMme. de Nucingen as a man measures another who has insulted him.\nThe Vicomtesse turned to him, and the expression of her eyes thanked him a thousand times for\nhis discretion. The first act came to an end just then.\n\"Do you know Mme. de Nucingen well enough to present M. de Rastignac to her?\" she asked of\nthe Marquis d'Ajuda.\n\"She will be delighted,\" said the Marquis. The handsome Portuguese rose as he spoke and took\nthe student's arm, and in another moment Eugene found himself in Mme. de Nucingen's box.\n\"Madame,\" said the Marquis, \"I have the honor of presenting to you the Chevalier Eugene de\nRastignac; he is a cousin of Mme. de Beauseant's. You have made so deep an impression upon him, that I\nthought I would fill up the measure of his happiness by bringing him nearer to his divinity.\"\n\nWords spoken half jestingly to cover their somewhat disrespectful import; but such an\nimplication, if carefully disguised, never gives offence to a woman. Mme. de Nucingen smiled, and\noffered Eugene the place which her husband had just left.\n\"I do not venture to suggest that you should stay with me, monsieur,\" she said. \"Those who are so\nfortunate as to be in Mme. de Beauseant's company do not desire to leave it.\"\n\"Madame,\" Eugene said, lowering his voice, \"I think that to please my cousin I should remain\nwith you. Before my lord Marquis came we were speaking of you and of your exceedingly distinguished\nappearance,\" he added aloud.\nM. d'Ajuda turned and left them.\n\"Are you really going to stay with me, monsieur?\" asked the Baroness. \"Then we shall make each\nother's acquaintance. Mme. de Restaud told me about you, and has made me anxious to meet you.\"\n\"She must be very insincere, then, for she has shut her door on me.\"\n\"What?\"\n\"Madame, I will tell you honestly the reason why; but I must crave your indulgence before\nconfiding such a secret to you. I am your father's neighbor; I had no idea that Mme. de Restaud was his\ndaughter. I was rash enough to mention his name; I meant no harm, but I annoyed your sister and her\nhusband very much. You cannot think how severely the Duchesse de Langeais and my cousin blamed this\napostasy on a daughter's part, as a piece of bad taste. I told them all about it, and they both burst out\nlaughing. Then Mme. de Beauseant made some comparison between you and your sister, speaking in high\nterms of you, and saying how very fond you were of my neighbor, M. Goriot. And, indeed, how could\nyou help loving him? He adores you so passionately that I am jealous already. We talked about you this\nmorning for two hours. So this evening I was quite full of all that your father had told me, and while I was\ndining with my cousin I said that you could not be as beautiful as affectionate. Mme. de Beauseant meant\nto gratify such warm admiration, I think, when she brought me here, telling me, in her gracious way, that\nI should see you.\"\n\"Then, even now, I owe you a debt of gratitude, monsieur,\" said the banker's wife. \"We shall be\nquite old friends in a little while.\"\n\"Although a friendship with you could not be like an ordinary friendship,\" said Rastignac; \"I\nshould never wish to be your friend.\"\nSuch stereotyped phrases as these, in the mouths of beginners, possess an unfailing charm for\nwomen, and are insipid only when read coldly; for a young man's tone, glance and attitude give a\nsurpassing eloquence to the banal phrases. Mme. de Nucingen thought that Rastignac was adorable. Then,\nwoman-like, being at a loss how to reply to the student's outspoken admiration, she answered a previous\nremark.\n\"Yes, it is very wrong of my sister to treat our poor father as she does,\" she said; \"he has been a\nProvidence to us. It was not until M. de Nucingen positively ordered me only to receive him in the\nmornings that I yielded the point. But I have been unhappy about it for a long while; I have shed many\ntears over it. This violence to my feelings, with my husband's brutal treatment, have been two causes of\n\nmy unhappy married life. There is certainly no woman in Paris whose lot seems more enviable than mine,\nand yet, in reality, there is not one so much to be pitied. You will think I must be out of my senses to talk\nto you like this; but you know my father, and I cannot regard you as a stranger.\"\n\"You will find no one,\" said Eugene, \"who longs as eagerly as I do to be yours. What do all\nwomen seek? Happiness.\" (He answered his own question in low, vibrating tones.) \"And if happiness for\na woman means that she is to be loved and adored, to have a friend to whom she can pour out her wishes,\nher fancies, her sorrows and joys; to whom she can lay bare her heart and soul, and all her fair defects and\nher gracious virtues, without fear of a betrayal; believe me, the devotion and the warmth that never fails\ncan only be found in the heart of a young man who, at a bare sign from you, would go to his death, who\nneither knows nor cares to know anything as yet of the world, because you will be all the world to him. I\nmyself, you see (you will laugh at my simplicity), have just come from a remote country district; I am\nquite new to this world of Paris; I have only known true and loving hearts; and I made up my mind that\nhere I should find no love. Then I chanced to meet my cousin, and to see my cousin's heart from very\nnear; I have divined the inexhaustible treasures of passion, and, like Cherubino, I am the lover of all\nwomen, until the day comes when I find _the_ woman to whom I may devote myself. As soon as I saw\nyou, as soon as I came into the theatre this evening, I felt myself borne towards you as if by the current of\na stream. I had so often thought of you already, but I had never dreamed that you would be so beautiful!\nMme. de Beauseant told me that I must not look so much at you. She does not know the charm of your\nred lips, your fair face, nor see how soft your eyes are. . . . I also am beginning to talk nonsense; but let\nme talk.\"\nNothing pleases a woman better than to listen to such whispered words as these; the most\npuritanical among them listens even when she ought not to reply to them; and Rastignac, having once\nbegun, continued to pour out his story, dropping his voice, that she might lean and listen; and Mme. de\nNucingen, smiling, glanced from time to time at de Marsay, who still sat in the Princesse Galathionne's\nbox.\nRastignac did not leave Mme. de Nucingen till her husband came to take her home.\n\"Madame,\" Eugene said, \"I shall have the pleasure of calling upon you before the Duchesse de\nCarigliano's ball.\"\n\"If Matame infites you to come,\" said the Baron, a thickset Alsatian, with indications of a sinister\ncunning in his full-moon countenance, \"you are quide sure of being well receifed.\"\n\"My affairs seem to be in a promising way,\" said Eugene to himself.--\" 'Can you love me?' I\nasked her, and she did not resent it. The bit is in the horse's mouth, and I have only to mount and ride;\"\nand with that he went to pay his respects to Mme. de Beauseant, who was leaving the theatre on d'Ajuda's\narm.\nThe student did not know that the Baroness' thoughts had been wandering; that she was even then\nexpecting a letter from de Marsay, one of those letters that bring about a rupture that rends the soul; so,\nhappy in his delusion, Eugene went with the Vicomtesse to the peristyle, where people were waiting till\ntheir carriages were announced.\n\"That cousin of yours is hardly recognizable for the same man,\" said the Portuguese laughingly to\nthe Vicomtesse, when Eugene had taken leave of them. \"He will break the bank. He is as supple as an eel;\nhe will go a long way, of that I am sure. Who else could have picked out a woman for him, as you did,\n\njust when she needed consolation?\"\n\"But it is not certain that she does not still love the faithless lover,\" said Mme. de Beauseant.\nThe student meanwhile walked back from the Theatre-Italien to the Rue\nNeuve-Sainte-Genevieve, making the most delightful plans as he went. He had noticed how closely Mme.\nde Restaud had scrutinized him when he sat beside Mme. de Nucingen, and inferred that the Countess'\ndoors would not be closed in the future. Four important houses were now open to him--for he meant to\nstand well with the Marechale; he had four supporters in the inmost circle of society in Paris. Even now it\nwas clear to him that, once involved in this intricate social machinery, he must attach himself to a spoke\nof the wheel that was to turn and raise his fortunes; he would not examine himself too curiously as to the\nmethods, but he was certain of the end, and conscious of the power to gain and keep his hold.\n\"If Mme. de Nucingen takes an interest in me, I will teach her how to manage her husband. That\nhusband of hers is a great speculator; he might put me in the way of making a fortune by a single stroke.\"\nHe did not say this bluntly in so many words; as yet, indeed, he was not sufficient of a\ndiplomatist to sum up a situation, to see its possibilities at a glance, and calculate the chances in his favor.\nThese were nothing but hazy ideas that floated over his mental horizon; they were less cynical than\nVautrin's notions; but if they had been tried in the crucible of conscience, no very pure result would have\nissued from the test. It is by a succession of such like transactions that men sink at last to the level of the\nrelaxed morality of this epoch, when there have never been so few of those who square their courses with\ntheir theories, so few of those noble characters who do not yield to temptation, for whom the slightest\ndeviation from the line of rectitude is a crime. To these magnificent types of uncompromising Right we\nowe two masterpieces--the Alceste of Moliere, and, in our own day, the characters of Jeanie Deans and\nher father in Sir Walter Scott's novel. Perhaps a work which should chronicle the opposite course, which\nshould trace out all the devious courses through which a man of the world, a man of ambitions, drags his\nconscience, just steering clear of crime that he may gain his end and yet save appearances, such a\nchronicle would be no less edifying and no less dramatic.\nRastignac went home. He was fascinated by Mme. de Nucingen; he seemed to see her before him,\nslender and graceful as a swallow. He recalled the intoxicating sweetness of her eyes, her fair hair, the\ndelicate silken tissue of the skin, beneath which it almost seemed to him that he could see the blood\ncoursing; the tones of her voice still exerted a spell over him; he had forgotten nothing; his walk perhaps\nheated his imagination by sending a glow of warmth through his veins. He knocked unceremoniously at\nGoriot's door.\n\"I have seen Mme. Delphine, neighbor,\" said he.\n\"Where?\"\n\"At the Italiens.\"\n\"Did she enjoy it? . . . . Just come inside,\" and the old man left his bed, unlocked the door, and\npromptly returned again.\nIt was the first time that Eugene had been in Father Goriot's room, and he could not control his\nfeeling of amazement at the contrast between the den in which the father lived and the costume of the\ndaughter whom he had just beheld. The window was curtainless, the walls were damp, in places the\n\nvarnished wall-paper had come away and gave glimpses of the grimy yellow plaster beneath. The\nwretched bed on which the old man lay boasted but one thin blanket, and a wadded quilt made out of\nlarge pieces of Mme. Vauquer's old dresses. The floor was damp and gritty. Opposite the window stood a\nchest of drawers made of rosewood, one of the old-fashioned kind with a curving front and brass handles,\nshaped like rings of twisted vine stems covered with flowers and leaves. On a venerable piece of furniture\nwith a wooden shelf stood a ewer and basin and shaving apparatus. A pair of shoes stood in one corner; a\nnight-table by the bed had neither a door nor marble slab. There was not a trace of a fire in the empty\ngrate; the square walnut table with the crossbar against which Father Goriot had crushed and twisted his\nposset-dish stood near the hearth. The old man's hat was lying on a broken-down bureau. An armchair\nstuffed with straw and a couple of chairs completed the list of ramshackle furniture. From the tester of the\nbed, tied to the ceiling by a piece of rag, hung a strip of some cheap material in large red and black\nchecks. No poor drudge in a garret could be worse lodged than Father Goriot in Mme. Vauquer's\nlodging-house. The mere sight of the room sent a chill through you and a sense of oppression; it was like\nthe worst cell in a prison. Luckily, Goriot could not see the effect that his surroundings produced on\nEugene as the latter deposited his candle on the night-table. The old man turned round, keeping the\nbedclothes huddled up to his chin.\n\"Well,\" he said, \"and which do you like the best, Mme. de Restaud or Mme. de Nucingen?\"\n\"I like Mme. Delphine the best,\" said the law student, \"because she loves you the best.\"\nAt the words so heartily spoken the old man's hand slipped out from under the bedclothes and\ngrasped Eugene's.\n\"Thank you, thank you,\" he said, gratefully. \"Then what did she say about me?\"\nThe student repeated the Baroness' remarks with some embellishments of his own, the old man\nlistening the while as though he heard a voice from Heaven.\n\"Dear child!\" he said. \"Yes, yes, she is very fond of me. But you must not believe all that she tells\nyou about Anastasie. The two sisters are jealous of each other, you see, another proof of their affection.\nMme. de Restaud is very fond of me too. I know she is. A father sees his children as God sees all of us; he\nlooks into the very depths of their hearts; he knows their intentions; and both of them are so loving. Oh! if\nI only had good sons-in-law, I should be too happy, and I dare say there is no perfect happiness here\nbelow. If I might live with them--simply hear their voices, know that they are there, see them go and\ncome as I used to do at home when they were still with me; why, my heart bounds at the thought. . . .\nWere they nicely dressed?\"\n\"Yes,\" said Eugene. \"But, M. Goriot, how is it that your daughters have such fine houses, while\nyou live in such a den as this?\"\n\"Dear me, why should I want anything better?\" he replied, with seeming carelessness. \"I can't\nquite explain to you how it is; I am not used to stringing words together properly, but it all lies there----\"\nhe said, tapping his heart. \"My real life is in my two girls, you see; and so long as they are happy, and\nsmartly dressed, and have soft carpets under their feet, what does it matter what clothes I wear or where I\nlie down of a night? I shall never feel cold so long as they are warm; I shall never feel dull if they are\nlaughing. I have no troubles but theirs. When you, too, are a father, and you hear your children's little\nvoices, you will say to yourself, 'That has all come from me.' You will feel that those little ones are akin\nto every drop in your veins, that they are the very flower of your life (and what else are they?); you will\n\ncleave so closely to them that you seem to feel every movement that they make. Everywhere I hear their\nvoices sounding in my ears. If they are sad, the look in their eyes freezes my blood. Some day you will\nfind out that there is far more happiness in another's happiness than in your own. It is something that I\ncannot explain, something within that sends a glow of warmth all through you. In short, I live my life\nthree times over. Shall I tell you something funny? Well, then, since I have been a father, I have come to\nunderstand God. He is everywhere in the world, because the whole world comes from Him. And it is just\nthe same with my children, monsieur. Only, I love my daughters better than God loves the world, for the\nworld is not so beautiful as God Himself is, but my children are more beautiful than I am. Their lives are\nso bound up with mine that I felt somehow that you would see them this evening. Great Heaven! If any\nman would make my little Delphine as happy as a wife is when she is loved, I would black his boots and\nrun on his errands. That miserable M. de Marsay is a cur; I know all about him from her maid. A longing\nto wring his neck comes over me now and then. He does not love her! does not love a pearl of a woman,\nwith a voice like a nightingale and shaped like a model. Where can her eyes have been when she married\nthat great lump of an Alsatian? They ought both of them to have married young men, good-looking and\ngood-tempered--but, after all, they had their own way.\"\nFather Goriot was sublime. Eugene had never yet seen his face light up as it did now with the\npassionate fervor of a father's love. It is worthy of remark that strong feeling has a very subtle and\npervasive power; the roughest nature, in the endeavor to express a deep and sincere affection,\ncommunicates to others the influence that has put resonance into the voice, and eloquence into every\ngesture, wrought a change in the very features of the speaker; for under the inspiration of passion the\nstupidest human being attains to the highest eloquence of ideas, if not of language, and seems to move in\nsome sphere of light. In the old man's tones and gesture there was something just then of the same spell\nthat a great actor exerts over his audience. But does not the poet in us find expression in our affections?\n\"Well,\" said Eugene, \"perhaps you will not be sorry to hear that she is pretty sure to break with de\nMarsay before long. That sprig of fashion has left her for the Princesse Galathionne. For my part, I fell in\nlove with Mme. Delphine this evening.\"\n\"Stuff!\" said Father Goriot.\n\"I did indeed, and she did not regard me with aversion. For a whole hour we talked of love, and I\nam to go to call on her on Saturday, the day after to-morrow.\"\n\"Oh! how I should love you, if she should like you. You are kind-hearted; you would never make\nher miserable. If you were to forsake her, I would cut your throat at once. A woman does not love twice,\nyou see! Good heavens! what nonsense I am talking, M. Eugene! It is cold; you ought not to stay here.\n_Mon Dieu!_ so you have heard her speak? What message did she give you for me?\"\n\"None at all,\" said Eugene to himself; aloud he answered, \"She told me to tell you that your\ndaughter sends you a good kiss.\"\n\"Good-night, neighbor! Sleep well, and pleasant dreams to you! I have mine already made for me\nby that message from her. May God grant you all your desires! You have come in like a good angel on\nme to-night, and brought with you the air that my daughter breathes.\"\n\"Poor old fellow!\" said Eugene as he lay down. \"It is enough to melt a heart of stone. His\ndaughter no more thought of him than of the Grand Turk.\"\n\nEver after this conference Goriot looked upon his neighbor as a friend, a confidant such as he had\nnever hoped to find; and there was established between the two the only relationship that could attach this\nold man to another man. The passions never miscalculate. Father Goriot felt that this friendship brought\nhim closer to his daughter Delphine; he thought that he should find a warmer welcome for himself if the\nBaroness should care for Eugene. Moreover, he had confided one of his troubles to the younger man.\nMme. de Nucingen, for whose happiness he prayed a thousand times daily, had never known the joys of\nlove. Eugene was certainly (to make use of his own expression) one of the nicest young men that he had\never seen, and some prophetic instinct seemed to tell him that Eugene was to give her the happiness\nwhich had not been hers. These were the beginnings of a friendship that grew up between the old man and\nhis neighbor; but for this friendship the catastrophe of the drama must have remained a mystery.\nThe affection with which Father Goriot regarded Eugene, by whom he seated himself at\nbreakfast, the change in Goriot's face, which as a rule, looked as expressionless as a plaster cast, and a\nfew words that passed between the two, surprised the other lodgers. Vautrin, who saw Eugene for the first\ntime since their interview, seemed as if he would fain read the student's very soul. During the night\nEugene had had some time in which to scan the vast field which lay before him; and now, as he\nremembered yesterday's proposal, the thought of Mlle. Taillefer's dowry came, of course, to his mind, and\nhe could not help thinking of Victorine as the most exemplary youth may think of an heiress. It chanced\nthat their eyes met. The poor girl did not fail to see that Eugene looked very handsome in his new clothes.\nSo much was said in the glance, thus exchanged, that Eugene could not doubt but that he was associated\nin her mind with the vague hopes that lie dormant in a girl's heart and gather round the first attractive\nnewcomer. \"Eight hundred thousand francs!\" a voice cried in his ears, but suddenly he took refuge in the\nmemories of yesterday evening, thinking that his extemporized passion for Mme. de Nucingen was a\ntalisman that would preserve him from this temptation.\n\"They gave Rossini's _Barber of Seville_ at the Italiens yesterday evening,\" he remarked. \"I never\nheard such delicious music. Good gracious! how lucky people are to have a box at the Italiens!\"\nFather Goriot drank in every word that Eugene let fall, and watched him as a dog watches his\nmaster's slightest movement.\n\"You men are like fighting cocks,\" said Mme. Vauquer; \"you do what you like.\"\n\"How did you get back?\" inquired Vautrin.\n\"I walked,\" answered Eugene.\n\"For my own part,\" remarked the tempter, \"I do not care about doing things by halves. If I want to\nenjoy myself that way, I should prefer to go in my carriage, sit in my own box, and do the thing\ncomfortably. Everything or nothing; that is my motto.\"\n\"And a good one, too,\" commented Mme. Vauquer.\n\"Perhaps you will see Mme. de Nucingen to-day,\" said Eugene, addressing Goriot in an\nundertone. \"She will welcome you with open arms, I am sure; she would want to ask you for all sorts of\nlittle details about me. I have found out that she will do anything in the world to be known by my cousin\nMme. de Beauseant; don't forget to tell her that I love her too well not to think of trying to arrange this.\"\n\nRastignac went at once to the Ecole de Droit. He had no mind to stay a moment longer than was\nnecessary in that odious house. He wasted his time that day; he had fallen a victim to that fever of the\nbrain that accompanies the too vivid hopes of youth. Vautrin's arguments had set him meditating on social\nlife, and he was deep in these reflections when he happened on his friend Bianchon in the Jardin du\nLuxembourg.\n\"What makes you look so solemn?\" said the medical student, putting an arm through Eugene's as\nthey went towards the Palais.\n\"I am tormented by temptations.\"\n\"What kind? There is a cure for temptation.\"\n\"What?\"\n\"Yielding to it.\"\n\"You laugh, but you don't know what it is all about. Have you read Rousseau?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"Do you remember that he asks the reader somewhere what he would do if he could make a\nfortune by killing an old mandarin somewhere in China by mere force of wishing it, and without stirring\nfrom Paris?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"Well, then?\"\n\"Pshaw! I am at my thirty-third mandarin.\"\n\"Seriously, though. Look here, suppose you were sure that you could do it, and had only to give a\nnod. Would you do it?\"\n\"Is he well stricken in years, this mandarin of yours? Pshaw! after all, young or old, paralytic, or\nwell and sound, my word for it. . . . Well, then. Hang it, no!\"\n\"You are a good fellow, Bianchon. But suppose you loved a woman well enough to lose your\nsoul in hell for her, and that she wanted money for dresses and a carriage, and all her whims, in fact?\"\n\"Why, here you are taking away my reason, and want me to reason!\"\n\"Well, then, Bianchon, I am mad; bring me to my senses. I have two sisters as beautiful and\ninnocent as angels, and I want them to be happy. How am I to find two hundred thousand francs apiece\nfor them in the next five years? Now and then in life, you see, you must play for heavy stakes, and it is no\nuse wasting your luck on low play.\"\n\"But you are only stating the problem that lies before every one at the outset of his life, and you\nwant to cut the Gordian knot with a sword. If that is the way of it, dear boy, you must be an Alexander, or\n\nto the hulks you go. For my own part, I am quite contented with the little lot I mean to make for myself\nsomewhere in the country, when I mean to step into my father's shoes and plod along. A man's affections\nare just as fully satisfied by the smallest circle as they can be by a vast circumference. Napoleon himself\ncould only dine once, and he could not have more mistresses than a house student at the Capuchins.\nHappiness, old man, depends on what lies between the sole of your foot and the crown of your head; and\nwhether it costs a million or a hundred louis, the actual amount of pleasure that you receive rests entirely\nwith you, and is just exactly the same in any case. I am for letting that Chinaman live.\"\n\"Thank you, Bianchon; you have done me good. We will always be friends.\"\n\"I say,\" remarked the medical student, as they came to the end of a broad walk in the Jardin des\nPlantes, \"I saw the Michonneau and Poiret a few minutes ago on a bench chatting with a gentleman whom\nI used to see in last year's troubles hanging about the Chamber of Deputies; he seems to me, in fact, to be\na detective dressed up like a decent retired tradesman. Let us keep an eye on that couple; I will tell you\nwhy some time. Good-bye; it is nearly four o'clock, and I must be in to answer to my name.\"\nWhen Eugene reached the lodging-house, he found Father Goriot waiting for him.\n\"Here,\" cried the old man, \"here is a letter from her. Pretty handwriting, eh?\"\nEugene broke the seal and read:--\n\"Sir,--I have heard from my father that you are fond of Italian music. I shall be delighted if you\nwill do me the pleasure of accepting a seat in my box. La Fodor and Pellegrini will sing on Saturday, so\nI am sure that you will not refuse me. M. de Nucingen and I shall be pleased if you will dine with us; we\nshall be quite by ourselves. If you will come and be my escort, my husband will be glad to be relieved\nfrom his conjugal duties. Do not answer, but simply come.--Yours sincerely, D. DE N.\"\n\"Let me see it,\" said Father Goriot, when Eugene had read the letter. \"You are going, aren't you?\"\nhe added, when he had smelled the writing-paper. \"How nice it smells! Her fingers have touched it, that is\ncertain.\"\n\"A woman does not fling herself at a man's head in this way,\" the student was thinking. \"She\nwants to use me to bring back de Marsay; nothing but pique makes a woman do a thing like this.\"\n\"Well,\" said Father Goriot, \"what are you thinking about?\"\nEugene did not know the fever or vanity that possessed some women in those days; how should\nhe imagine that to open a door in the Faubourg Saint-Germain a banker's wife would go to almost any\nlength. For the coterie of the Faubourg Saint-Germain was a charmed circle, and the women who moved\nin it were at that time the queens of society; and among the greatest of these _Dames du Petit-Chateau_,\nas they were called, were Mme. de Beauseant and her friends the Duchesse de Langeais and the Duchesse\nde Maufrigneause. Rastignac was alone in his ignorance of the frantic efforts made by women who lived\nin the Chausee-d'Antin to enter this seventh heaven and shine among the brightest constellations of their\nsex. But his cautious disposition stood him in good stead, and kept his judgment cool, and the not\naltogether enviable power of imposing instead of accepting conditions.\n\"Yes, I am going,\" he replied.\n\nSo it was curiosity that drew him to Mme. de Nucingen; while, if she had treated him\ndisdainfully, passion perhaps might have brought him to her feet. Still he waited almost impatiently for\nto-morrow, and the hour when he could go to her. There is almost as much charm for a young man in a\nfirst flirtation as there is in first love. The certainty of success is a source of happiness to which men do\nnot confess, and all the charm of certain women lies in this. The desire of conquest springs no less from\nthe easiness than from the difficulty of triumph, and every passion is excited or sustained by one or the\nother of these two motives which divide the empire of love. Perhaps this division is one result of the great\nquestion of temperaments; which, after all, dominates social life. The melancholic temperament may\nstand in need of the tonic of coquetry, while those of nervous or sanguine complexion withdraw if they\nmeet with a too stubborn resistance. In other words, the lymphatic temperament is essentially despondent,\nand the rhapsodic is bilious.\nEugene lingered over his toilette with an enjoyment of all its little details that is grateful to a\nyoung man's self-love, though he will not own to it for fear of being laughed at. He thought, as he\narranged his hair, that a pretty woman's glances would wander through the dark curls. He indulged in\nchildish tricks like any young girl dressing for a dance, and gazed complacently at his graceful figure\nwhile he smoothed out the creases of his coat.\n\"There are worse figures, that is certain,\" he said to himself.\nThen he went downstairs, just as the rest of the household were sitting down to dinner, and took\nwith good humor the boisterous applause excited by his elegant appearance. The amazement with which\nany attention to dress is regarded in a lodging-house is a very characteristic trait. No one can put on a new\ncoat but every one else must say his say about it.\n\"Clk! clk! clk!\" cried Bianchon, making the sound with his tongue against the roof of his mouth,\nlike a driver urging on a horse.\n\"He holds himself like a duke and a peer of France,\" said Mme. Vauquer.\n\"Are you going a-courting?\" inquired Mlle. Michonneau.\n\"Cock-a-doodle-doo!\" cried the artist.\n\"My compliments to my lady your wife,\" from the _employe_ at the Museum.\n\"Your wife; have you a wife?\" asked Poiret.\n\"Yes, in compartments, water-tight and floats, guaranteed fast color, all prices from twenty-five\nto forty sous, neat check patterns in the latest fashion and best taste, will wash, half-linen, half-cotton,\nhalf-wool; a certain cure for toothache and other complaints under the patronage of the Royal College of\nPhysicians! children like it! a remedy for headache, indigestion, and all other diseases affecting the throat,\neyes, and ears!\" cried Vautrin, with a comical imitation of the volubility of a quack at a fair. \"And how\nmuch shall we say for this marvel, gentlemen? Twopence? No. Nothing of the sort. All that is left in stock\nafter supplying the Great Mogul. All the crowned heads of Europe, including the Gr-r-rand Duke of\nBaden, have been anxious to get a sight of it. Walk up! walk up! gentlemen! Pay at the desk as you go in!\nStrike up the music there! Brooum, la, la, trinn! la, la, boum! boum! Mister Clarinette, there you are out\nof tune!\" he added gruffly; \"I will rap your knuckles for you!\"\n\n\"Goodness! what an amusing man!\" said Mme. Vauquer to Mme. Couture; \"I should never feel\ndull with him in the house.\"\nThis burlesque of Vautrin's was the signal for an outburst of merriment, and under cover of jokes\nand laughter Eugene caught a glance from Mlle. Taillefer; she had leaned over to say a few words in\nMme. Couture's ear.\n\"The cab is at the door,\" announced Sylvie.\n\"But where is he going to dine?\" asked Bianchon.\n\"With Madame la Baronne de Nucingen.\"\n\"M. Goriot's daughter,\" said the law student.\nAt this, all eyes turned to the old vermicelli maker; he was gazing at Eugene with something like\nenvy in his eyes.\nRastignac reached the house in the Rue Saint-Lazare, one of those many-windowed houses with a\nmean-looking portico and slender columns, which are considered the thing in Paris, a typical banker's\nhouse, decorated in the most ostentatious fashion; the walls lined with stucco, the landings of marble\nmosaic. Mme. de Nucingen was sitting in a little drawing-room; the room was painted in the Italian\nfashion, and decorated like a restaurant. The Baroness seemed depressed. The effort that she made to hide\nher feelings aroused Eugene's interest; it was plain that she was not playing a part. He had expected a\nlittle flutter of excitement at his coming, and he found her dispirited and sad. The disappointment piqued\nhis vanity.\n\"My claim to your confidence is very small, madame,\" he said, after rallying her on her abstracted\nmood; \"but if I am in the way, please tell me so frankly; I count on your good faith.\"\n\"No, stay with me,\" she said; \"I shall be all alone if you go. Nucingen is dining in town, and I do\nnot want to be alone; I want to be taken out of myself.\"\n\"But what is the matter?\"\n\"You are the very last person whom I should tell,\" she exclaimed.\n\"Then I am connected in some way in this secret. I wonder what it is?\"\n\"Perhaps. Yet, no,\" she went on; \"it is a domestic quarrel, which ought to be buried in the depths\nof the heart. I am very unhappy; did I not tell you so the day before yesterday? Golden chains are the\nheaviest of all fetters.\"\nWhen a woman tells a young man that she is very unhappy, and when the young man is clever,\nand well dressed, and has fifteen hundred francs lying idle in his pocket, he is sure to think as Eugene\nsaid, and he becomes a coxcomb.\n\"What can you have left to wish for?\" he answered. \"You are young, beautiful, beloved, and\nrich.\"\n\n\"Do not let us talk of my affairs,\" she said shaking her head mournfully. \"We will dine together\n_tete-a-tete_, and afterwards we will go to hear the most exquisite music. Am I to your taste?\" she went\non, rising and displaying her gown of white cashmere, covered with Persian designs in the most superb\ntaste.\n\"I wish that you were altogether mine,\" said Eugene; \"you are charming.\"\n\"You would have a forlorn piece of property,\" she said, smiling bitterly. \"There is nothing about\nme that betrays my wretchedness; and yet, in spite of appearances, I am in despair. I cannot sleep; my\ntroubles have broken my night's rest; I shall grow ugly.\"\n\"Oh! that is impossible,\" cried the law student; \"but I am curious to know what these troubles can\nbe that a devoted love cannot efface.\"\n\"Ah! if I were to tell you about them, you would shun me,\" she said. \"Your love for me is as yet\nonly the conventional gallantry that men use to masquerade in; and, if you really loved me, you would be\ndriven to despair. I must keep silence, you see. Let us talk of something else, for pity's sake,\" she added.\n\"Let me show you my rooms.\"\n\"No; let us stay here,\" answered Eugene; he sat down on the sofa before the fire, and boldly took\nMme. de Nucingen's hand in his. She surrendered it to him; he even felt the pressure of her fingers in one\nof the spasmodic clutches that betray terrible agitation.\n\"Listen,\" said Rastignac; \"if you are in trouble, you ought to tell me about it. I want to prove to\nyou that I love you for yourself alone. You must speak to me frankly about your troubles, so that I can put\nan end to them, even if I have to kill half-a-dozen men; or I shall go, never to return.\"\n\"Very well,\" she cried, putting her hand to her forehead in an agony of despair, \"I will put you to\nthe proof, and this very moment. Yes,\" she said to herself, \"I have no other resource left.\"\nShe rang the bell.\n\"Are the horses put in for the master?\" she asked of the servant.\n\"Yes, madame.\"\n\"I shall take his carriage myself. He can have mine and my horses. Serve dinner at seven o'clock.\"\n\"Now, come with me,\" she said to Eugene, who thought as he sat in the banker's carriage beside\nMme. de Nucingen that he must surely be dreaming.\n\"To the Palais-Royal,\" she said to the coachman; \"stop near the Theatre-Francais.\"\nShe seemed to be too troubled and excited to answer the innumerable questions that Eugene put\nto her. He was at a loss what to think of her mute resistance, her obstinate silence.\n\"Another moment and she will escape me,\" he said to himself.\nWhen the carriage stopped at last, the Baroness gave the law student a glance that silenced his\n\nwild words, for he was almost beside himself.\n\"Is it true that you love me?\" she asked.\n\"Yes,\" he answered, and in his manner and tone there was no trace of the uneasiness that he felt.\n\"You will not think ill of me, will you, whatever I may ask of you?\"\n\"No.\"\n\"Are you ready to do my bidding?\"\n\"Blindly.\"\n\"Have you ever been to a gaming-house?\" she asked in a tremulous voice.\n\"Never.\"\n\"Ah! now I can breathe. You will have luck. Here is my purse,\" she said. \"Take it! there are a\nhundred francs in it, all that such a fortunate woman as I can call her own. Go up into one of the\ngaming-houses--I do not know where they are, but there are some near the Palais-Royal. Try your luck\nwith the hundred francs at a game they call roulette; lose it all or bring me back six thousand francs. I will\ntell you about my troubles when you come back.\"\n\"Devil take me, I'm sure, if I have a glimmer of a notion of what I am about, but I will obey you,\"\nhe added, with inward exultation, as he thought, \"She has gone too far to draw back--she can refuse me\nnothing now!\"\nEugene took the dainty little purse, inquired the way of a second-hand clothes-dealer, and hurried\nto number 9, which happened to be the nearest gaming-house. He mounted the staircase, surrendered his\nhat, and asked the way to the roulette-table, whither the attendant took him, not a little to the astonishment\nof the regular comers. All eyes were fixed on Eugene as he asked, without bashfulness, where he was to\ndeposit his stakes.\n\"If you put a louis on one only of those thirty-six numbers, and it turns up, you will win thirty-six\nlouis,\" said a respectable-looking, white-haired old man in answer to his inquiry.\nEugene staked the whole of his money on the number 21 (his own age). There was a cry of\nsurprise; before he knew what he had done, he had won.\n\"Take your money off, sir,\" said the old gentleman; \"you don't often win twice running by that\nsystem.\"\nEugene took the rake that the old man handed to him, and drew in his three thousand six hundred\nfrancs, and, still perfectly ignorant of what he was about, staked again on the red. The bystanders watched\nhim enviously as they saw him continue to play. The disc turned, and again he won; the banker threw him\nthree thousand six hundred francs once more.\n\"You have seven thousand, two hundred francs of your own,\" the old gentleman said in his ear.\n\n\"Take my advice and go away with your winnings; red has turned up eight times already. If you are\ncharitable, you will show your gratitude for sound counsel by giving a trifle to an old prefect of Napoleon\nwho is down on his luck.\"\nRastignac's head was swimming; he saw ten of his louis pass into the white-haired man's\npossession, and went down-stairs with his seven thousand francs; he was still ignorant of the game, and\nstupefied by his luck.\n\"So, that is over; and now where will you take me?\" he asked, as soon as the door was closed, and\nhe showed the seven thousand francs to Mme. de Nucingen.\nDelphine flung her arms about him, but there was no passion in that wild embrace.\n\"You have saved me!\" she cried, and tears of joy flowed fast.\n\"I will tell you everything, my friend. For you will be my friend, will you not? I am rich, you\nthink, very rich; I have everything I want, or I seem as if I had everything. Very well, you must know that\nM. de Nucingen does not allow me the control of a single penny; he pays all the bills for the house\nexpenses; he pays for my carriages and opera box; he does not give me enough to pay for my dress, and\nhe reduces me to poverty in secret on purpose. I am too proud to beg from him. I should be the vilest of\nwomen if I could take his money at the price at which he offers it. Do you ask how I, with seven hundred\nthousand francs of my own, could let myself be robbed? It is because I was proud, and scorned to speak.\nWe are so young, so artless when our married life begins! I never could bring myself to ask my husband\nfor money; the words would have made my lips bleed, I did not dare to ask; I spent my savings first, and\nthen the money that my poor father gave me, then I ran into debt. Marriage for me is a hideous farce; I\ncannot talk about it, let it suffice to say that Nucingen and I have separate rooms, and that I would fling\nmyself out of the window sooner than consent to any other manner of life. I suffered agonies when I had\nto confess to my girlish extravagance, my debts for jewelry and trifles (for our poor father had never\nrefused us anything, and spoiled us), but at last I found courage to tell him about them. After all, I had a\nfortune of my own. Nucingen flew into a rage; he said that I should be the ruin of him, and used frightful\nlanguage! I wished myself a hundred feet down in the earth. He had my dowry, so he paid my debts, but\nhe stipulated at the same time that my expenses in future must not exceed a certain fixed sum, and I gave\nway for the sake of peace. And then,\" she went on, \"I wanted to gratify the self-love of some one whom\nyou know. He may have deceived me, but I should do him the justice to say that there was nothing petty\nin his character. But, after all, he threw me over disgracefully. If, at a woman's utmost need, _somebody_\nheaps gold upon her, he ought never to forsake her; that love should last for ever! But you, at\none-and-twenty, you, the soul of honor, with the unsullied conscience of youth, will ask me how a woman\ncan bring herself to accept money in such a way? _Mon Dieu_! is it not natural to share everything with\nthe one to whom we owe our happiness? When all has been given, why should we pause and hesitate over\na part? Money is as nothing between us until the moment when the sentiment that bound us together\nceases to exist. Were we not bound to each other for life? Who that believes in love foresees such an end\nto love? You swear to love us eternally; how, then, can our interests be separate?\n\"You do not know how I suffered to-day when Nucingen refused to give me six thousand francs;\nhe spends as much as that every month on his mistress, an opera dancer! I thought of killing myself. The\nwildest thoughts came into my head. There have been moments in my life when I have envied my\nservants, and would have changed places with my maid. It was madness to think of going to our father,\nAnastasie and I have bled him dry; our poor father would have sold himself if he could have raised six\nthousand francs that way. I should have driven him frantic to no purpose. You have saved me from shame\n\nand death; I was beside myself with anguish. Ah! monsieur, I owed you this explanation after my mad\nravings. When you left me just now, as soon as you were out of sight, I longed to escape, to run away . . .\nwhere, I did not know. Half the women in Paris lead such lives as mine; they live in apparent luxury, and\nin their souls are tormented by anxiety. I know of poor creatures even more miserable than I; there are\nwomen who are driven to ask their tradespeople to make out false bills, women who rob their husbands.\nSome men believe that an Indian shawl worth a thousand louis only cost five hundred francs, others that a\nshawl costing five hundred francs is worth a hundred louis. There are women, too, with narrow incomes,\nwho scrape and save and starve their children to pay for a dress. I am innocent of these base meannesses.\nBut this is the last extremity of my torture. Some women will sell themselves to their husbands, and so\nobtain their way, but I, at any rate, am free. If I chose, Nucingen would cover me with gold, but I would\nrather weep on the breast of a man whom I can respect. Ah! tonight, M. de Marsay will no longer have a\nright to think of me as a woman whom he has paid.\" She tried to conceal her tears from him, hiding her\nface in her hands; Eugene drew them away and looked at her; she seemed to him sublime at that moment.\n\"It is hideous, is it not,\" she cried, \"to speak in a breath of money and affection. You cannot love\nme after this,\" she added.\nThe incongruity between the ideas of honor which make women so great, and the errors in\nconduct which are forced upon them by the constitution of society, had thrown Eugene's thoughts into\nconfusion; he uttered soothing and consoling words, and wondered at the beautiful woman before him,\nand at the artless imprudence of her cry of pain.\n\"You will not remember this against me?\" she asked; \"promise me that you will not.\"\n\"Ah! madame, I am incapable of doing so,\" he said. She took his hand and held it to her heart, a\nmovement full of grace that expressed her deep gratitude.\n\"I am free and happy once more, thanks to you,\" she said. \"Oh! I have felt lately as if I were in\nthe grasp of an iron hand. But after this I mean to live simply and to spend nothing. You will think me\njust as pretty, will you not, my friend? Keep this,\" she went on, as she took only six of the banknotes. \"In\nconscience I owe you a thousand crowns, for I really ought to go halves with you.\"\nEugene's maiden conscience resisted; but when the Baroness said, \"I am bound to look on you as\nan accomplice or as an enemy,\" he took the money.\n\"It shall be a last stake in reserve,\" he said, \"in case of misfortune.\"\n\"That was what I was dreading to hear,\" she cried, turning pale. \"Oh, if you would that I should\nbe anything to you, swear to me that you will never re-enter a gaming-house. Great Heaven! that I should\ncorrupt you! I should die of sorrow!\"\nThey had reached the Rue Saint-Lazare by this time. The contrast between the ostentation of\nwealth in the house, and the wretched condition of its mistress, dazed the student; and Vautrin's cynical\nwords began to ring in his ears.\n\"Seat yourself there,\" said the Baroness, pointing to a low chair beside the fire. \"I have a difficult\nletter to write,\" she added. \"Tell me what to say.\"\n\"Say nothing,\" Eugene answered her. \"Put the bills in an envelope, direct it, and send it by your\n\nmaid.\"\n\"Why, you are a love of a man,\" she said. \"Ah! see what it is to have been well brought up. That\nis the Beauseant through and through,\" she went on, smiling at him.\n\"She is charming,\" thought Eugene, more and more in love. He looked round him at the room;\nthere was an ostentatious character about the luxury, a meretricious taste in the splendor.\n\"Do you like it?\" she asked, as she rang for the maid.\n\"Therese, take this to M. de Marsay, and give it into his hands yourself. If he is not at home, bring\nthe letter back to me.\"\nTherese went, but not before she had given Eugene a spiteful glance.\nDinner was announced. Rastignac gave his arm to Mme. de Nucingen, she led the way into a\npretty dining-room, and again he saw the luxury of the table which he had admired in his cousin's house.\n\"Come and dine with me on opera evenings, and we will go to the Italiens afterwards,\" she said.\n\"I should soon grow used to the pleasant life if it could last, but I am a poor student, and I have\nmy way to make.\"\n\"Oh! you will succeed,\" she said laughing. \"You will see. All that you wish will come to pass. _I_\ndid not expect to be so happy.\"\nIt is the wont of women to prove the impossible by the possible, and to annihilate facts by\npresentiments. When Mme. de Nucingen and Rastignac took their places in her box at the Bouffons, her\nface wore a look of happiness that made her so lovely that every one indulged in those small slanders\nagainst which women are defenceless; for the scandal that is uttered lightly is often seriously believed.\nThose who know Paris, believe nothing that is said, and say nothing of what is done there.\nEugene took the Baroness' hand in his, and by some light pressure of the fingers, or a closer grasp\nof the hand, they found a language in which to express the sensations which the music gave them. It was\nan evening of intoxicating delight for both; and when it ended, and they went out together, Mme. de\nNucingen insisted on taking Eugene with her as far as the Pont Neuf, he disputing with her the whole of\nthe way for a single kiss after all those that she had showered upon him so passionately at the\nPalais-Royal; Eugene reproached her with inconsistency.\n\"That was gratitude,\" she said, \"for devotion that I did not dare to hope for, but now it would be a\npromise.\"\n\"And will you give me no promise, ingrate?\"\nHe grew vexed. Then, with one of those impatient gestures that fill a lover with ecstasy, she gave\nhim her hand to kiss, and he took it with a discontented air that delighted her.\n\"I shall see you at the ball on Monday,\" she said.\n\nAs Eugene went home in the moonlight, he fell to serious reflections. He was satisfied, and yet\ndissatisfied. He was pleased with an adventure which would probably give him his desire, for in the end\none of the prettiest and best-dressed women in Paris would be his; but, as a set-off, he saw his hopes of\nfortune brought to nothing; and as soon as he realized this fact, the vague thoughts of yesterday evening\nbegan to take a more decided shape in his mind. A check is sure to reveal to us the strength of our hopes.\nThe more Eugene learned of the pleasures of life in Paris, the more impatient he felt of poverty and\nobscurity. He crumpled the banknote in his pocket, and found any quantity of plausible excuses for\nappropriating it.\nHe reached the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Genevieve at last, and from the stairhead he saw a light in\nGoriot's room; the old man had lighted a candle, and set the door ajar, lest the student should pass him by,\nand go to his room without \"telling him all about his daughter,\" to use his own expression. Eugene,\naccordingly, told him everything without reserve.\n\"Then they think that I am ruined!\" cried Father Goriot, in an agony of jealousy and desperation.\n\"Why, I have still thirteen hundred livres a year! _Mon Dieu!_ Poor little girl! why did she not come to\nme? I would have sold my rentes; she should have had some of the principal, and I would have bought a\nlife-annuity with the rest. My good neighbor, why did not _you_ come to tell me of her difficulty? How\nhad you the heart to go and risk her poor little hundred francs at play? This is heart-breaking work. You\nsee what it is to have sons-in-law. Oh! if I had hold of them, I would wring their necks. _Mon Dieu!\ncrying!_ Did you say she was crying?\"\n\"With her head on my waistcoat,\" said Eugene.\n\"Oh! give it to me,\" said Father Goriot. \"What! my daughter's tears have fallen there--my darling\nDelphine, who never used to cry when she was a little girl! Oh! I will buy you another; do not wear it\nagain; let me have it. By the terms of her marriage-contract, she ought to have the use of her property.\nTo-morrow morning I will go and see Derville; he is an attorney. I will demand that her money should be\ninvested in her own name. I know the law. I am an old wolf, I will show my teeth.\"\n\"Here, father; this is a banknote for a thousand francs that she wanted me to keep out of our\nwinnings. Keep them for her, in the pocket of the waistcoat.\"\nGoriot looked hard at Eugene, reached out and took the law student's hand, and Eugene felt a tear\nfall on it.\n\"You will succeed,\" the old man said. \"God is just, you see. I know an honest man when I see\nhim, and I can tell you, there are not many men like you. I am to have another dear child in you, am I?\nThere, go to sleep; you can sleep; you are not yet a father. She was crying! and I have to be told about\nit!--and I was quietly eating my dinner, like an idiot, all the time--I, who would sell the Father, Son and\nHoly Ghost to save one tear to either of them.\"\n\"An honest man!\" said Eugene to himself as he lay down. \"Upon my word, I think I will be an\nhonest man all my life; it is so pleasant to obey the voice of conscience.\" Perhaps none but believers in\nGod do good in secret; and Eugene believed in a God.\nThe next day Rastignac went at the appointed time to Mme. de Beauseant, who took him with her\n\nto the Duchesse de Carigliano's ball. The Marechale received Eugene most graciously. Mme. de Nucingen\nwas there. Delphine's dress seemed to suggest that she wished for the admiration of others, so that she\nmight shine the more in Eugene's eyes; she was eagerly expecting a glance from him, hiding, as she\nthought, this eagerness from all beholders. This moment is full of charm for one who can guess all that\npasses in a woman's mind. Who has not refrained from giving his opinion, to prolong her suspense,\nconcealing his pleasure from a desire to tantalize, seeking a confession of love in her uneasiness, enjoying\nthe fears that he can dissipate by a smile? In the course of the evening the law student suddenly\ncomprehended his position; he saw that, as the cousin of Mme. de Beauseant, he was a personage in this\nworld. He was already credited with the conquest of Mme. de Nucingen, and for this reason was a\nconspicuous figure; he caught the envious glances of other young men, and experienced the earliest\npleasures of coxcombry. People wondered at his luck, and scraps of these conversations came to his ears\nas he went from room to room; all the women prophesied his success; and Delphine, in her dread of\nlosing him, promised that this evening she would not refuse the kiss that all his entreaties could scarcely\nwin yesterday.\nRastignac received several invitations. His cousin presented him to other women who were\npresent; women who could claim to be of the highest fashion; whose houses were looked upon as\npleasant; and this was the loftiest and most fashionable society in Paris into which he was launched. So\nthis evening had all the charm of a brilliant debut; it was an evening that he was to remember even in old\nage, as a woman looks back upon her first ball and the memories of her girlish triumphs.\nThe next morning, at breakfast, he related the story of his success for the benefit of Father Goriot\nand the lodgers. Vautrin began to smile in a diabolical fashion.\n\"And do you suppose,\" cried that cold-blooded logician, \"that a young man of fashion can live\nhere in the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Genevieve, in the Maison Vauquer--an exceedingly respectable\nboarding-house in every way, I grant you, but an establishment that, none the less, falls short of being\nfashionable? The house is comfortable, it is lordly in its abundance; it is proud to be the temporary abode\nof a Rastignac; but, after all, it is in the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Genevieve, and luxury would be out of place\nhere, where we only aim at the purely _patriarchalorama_. If you mean to cut a figure in Paris, my young\nfriend,\" Vautrin continued, with half-paternal jocularity, \"you must have three horses, a tilbury for the\nmornings, and a closed carriage for the evening; you should spend altogether about nine thousand francs\non your stables. You would show yourself unworthy of your destiny if you spent no more than three\nthousand francs with your tailor, six hundred in perfumery, a hundred crowns to your shoemaker, and a\nhundred more to your hatter. As for your laundress, there goes another thousand francs; a young man of\nfashion must of necessity make a great point of his linen; if your linen comes up to the required standard,\npeople often do not look any further. Love and the Church demand a fair altar-cloth. That is fourteen\nthousand francs. I am saying nothing of losses at play, bets, and presents; it is impossible to allow less\nthan two thousand francs for pocket money. I have led that sort of life, and I know all about these\nexpenses. Add the cost of necessaries next; three hundred louis for provender, a thousand francs for a\nplace to roost in. Well, my boy, for all these little wants of ours we had need to have twenty-five thousand\nfrancs every year in our purse, or we shall find ourselves in the kennel, and people laughing at us, and our\ncareer is cut short, good-bye to success, and good-bye to your mistress! I am forgetting your valet and\nyour groom! Is Christophe going to carry your _billets-doux_ for you? Do you mean to employ the\nstationery you use at present? Suicidal policy! Hearken to the wisdom of your elders!\" he went on, his\nbass voice growing louder at each syllable. \"Either take up your quarters in a garret, live virtuously, and\nwed your work, or set about the thing in a different way.\"\nVautrin winked and leered in the direction of Mlle. Taillefer to enforce his remarks by a look\n\nwhich recalled the late tempting proposals by which he had sought to corrupt the student's mind.\nSeveral days went by, and Rastignac lived in a whirl of gaiety. He dined almost every day with\nMme. de Nucingen, and went wherever she went, only returning to the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Genevieve in\nthe small hours. He rose at mid-day, and dressed to go into the Bois with Delphine if the day was fine,\nsquandering in this way time that was worth far more than he knew. He turned as eagerly to learn the\nlessons of luxury, and was as quick to feel its fascination, as the flowers of the date palm to receive the\nfertilizing pollen. He played high, lost and won large sums of money, and at last became accustomed to\nthe extravagant life that young men lead in Paris. He sent fifteen hundred francs out of his first winnings\nto his mother and sisters, sending handsome presents as well as the money. He had given out that he\nmeant to leave the Maison Vauquer; but January came and went, and he was still there, still unprepared to\ngo.\nOne rule holds good of most young men--whether rich or poor. They never have money for the\nnecessaries of life, but they have always money to spare for their caprices--an anomaly which finds its\nexplanation in their youth and in the almost frantic eagerness with which youth grasps at pleasure. They\nare reckless with anything obtained on credit, while everything for which they must pay in ready money\nis made to last as long as possible; if they cannot have all that they want, they make up for it, it would\nseem, by squandering what they have. To state the matter simply--a student is far more careful of his hat\nthan of his coat, because the latter being a comparatively costly article of dress, it is in the nature of things\nthat a tailor should be a creditor; but it is otherwise with the hatter; the sums of money spent with him are\nso modest, that he is the most independent and unmanageable of his tribe, and it is almost impossible to\nbring him to terms. The young man in the balcony of a theatre who displays a gorgeous waistcoat for the\nbenefit of the fair owners of opera glasses, has very probably no socks in his wardrobe, for the hosier is\nanother of the genus of weevils that nibble at the purse. This was Rastignac's condition. His purse was\nalways empty for Mme. Vauquer, always full at the demand of vanity; there was a periodical ebb and\nflow in his fortunes, which was seldom favorable to the payment of just debts. If he was to leave that\nunsavory and mean abode, where from time to time his pretensions met with humiliation, the first step\nwas to pay his hostess for a month's board and lodging, and the second to purchase furniture worthy of the\nnew lodgings he must take in his quality of dandy, a course that remained impossible. Rastignac, out of\nhis winnings at cards, would pay his jeweler exorbitant prices for gold watches and chains, and then, to\nmeet the exigencies of play, would carry them to the pawnbroker, that discreet and forbidding-looking\nfriend of youth; but when it was a question of paying for board or lodging, or for the necessary\nimplements for the cultivation of his Elysian fields, his imagination and pluck alike deserted him. There\nwas no inspiration to be found in vulgar necessity, in debts contracted for past requirements. Like most of\nthose who trust to their luck, he put off till the last moment the payment of debts that among the\nbourgeoisie are regarded as sacred engagements, acting on the plan of Mirabeau, who never settled his\nbaker's bill until it underwent a formidable transformation into a bill of exchange.\nIt was about this time when Rastignac was down on his luck and fell into debt, that it became\nclear to the law student's mind that he must have some more certain source of income if he meant to live\nas he had been doing. But while he groaned over the thorny problems of his precarious situation, he felt\nthat he could not bring himself to renounce the pleasures of this extravagant life, and decided that he must\ncontinue it at all costs. His dreams of obtaining a fortune appeared more and more chimerical, and the real\nobstacles grew more formidable. His initiation into the secrets of the Nucingen household had revealed to\nhim that if he were to attempt to use this love affair as a means of mending his fortunes, he must swallow\ndown all sense of decency, and renounce all the generous ideas which redeem the sins of youth. He had\nchosen this life of apparent splendor, but secretly gnawed by the canker worm of remorse, a life of\nfleeting pleasure dearly paid for by persistent pain; like _Le Distrait_ of La Bruyere, he had descended so\n\nfar as to make his bed in a ditch; but (also like _Le Distrait_) he himself was uncontaminated as yet by the\nmire that stained his garments.\n\"So we have killed our mandarin, have we?\" said Bianchon one day as they left the dinner table.\n\"Not yet,\" he answered, \"but he is at his last gasp.\"\nThe medical student took this for a joke, but it was not a jest. Eugene had dined in the house that\nnight for the first time for a long while, and had looked thoughtful during the meal. He had taken his\nplace beside Mlle. Taillefer, and stayed through the dessert, giving his neighbor an expressive glance\nfrom time to time. A few of the boarders discussed the walnuts at the table, and others walked about the\nroom, still taking part in the conversation which had begun among them. People usually went when they\nchose; the amount of time that they lingered being determined by the amount of interest that the\nconversation possessed for them, or by the difficulty of the process of digestion. In winter-time the room\nwas seldom empty before eight o'clock, when the four women had it all to themselves, and made up for\nthe silence previously imposed upon them by the preponderating masculine element. This evening\nVautrin had noticed Eugene's abstractedness, and stayed in the room, though he had seemed to be in a\nhurry to finish his dinner and go. All through the talk afterwards he had kept out of the sight of the law\nstudent, who quite believed that Vautrin had left the room. He now took up his position cunningly in the\nsitting-room instead of going when the last boarders went. He had fathomed the young man's thoughts,\nand felt that a crisis was at hand. Rastignac was, in fact, in a dilemma, which many another young man\nmust have known.\nMme. de Nucingen might love him, or might merely be playing with him, but in either case\nRastignac had been made to experience all the alternations of hope and despair of genuine passion, and all\nthe diplomatic arts of a Parisienne had been employed on him. After compromising herself by continually\nappearing in public with Mme. de Beauseant's cousin she still hesitated, and would not give him the\nlover's privileges which he appeared to enjoy. For a whole month she had so wrought on his senses, that\nat last she had made an impression on his heart. If in the earliest days the student had fancied himself to\nbe master, Mme. de Nucingen had since become the stronger of the two, for she had skilfully roused and\nplayed upon every instinct, good or bad, in the two or three men comprised in a young student in Paris.\nThis was not the result of deep design on her part, nor was she playing a part, for women are in a manner\ntrue to themselves even through their grossest deceit, because their actions are prompted by a natural\nimpulse. It may have been that Delphine, who had allowed this young man to gain such an ascendency\nover her, conscious that she had been too demonstrative, was obeying a sentiment of dignity, and either\nrepented of her concessions, or it pleased her to suspend them. It is so natural to a Parisienne, even when\npassion has almost mastered her, to hesitate and pause before taking the plunge; to probe the heart of him\nto whom she intrusts her future. And once already Mme. de Nucingen's hopes had been betrayed, and her\nloyalty to a selfish young lover had been despised. She had good reason to be suspicious. Or it may have\nbeen that something in Eugene's manner (for his rapid success was making a coxcomb of him) had\nwarned her that the grotesque nature of their position had lowered her somewhat in his eyes. She\ndoubtless wished to assert her dignity; he was young, and she would be great in his eyes; for the lover\nwho had forsaken her had held her so cheap that she was determined that Eugene should not think her an\neasy conquest, and for this very reason--he knew that de Marsay had been his predecessor. Finally, after\nthe degradation of submission to the pleasure of a heartless young rake, it was so sweet to her to wander\nin the flower-strewn realms of love, that it was not wonderful that she should wish to dwell a while on the\nprospect, to tremble with the vibrations of love, to feel the freshness of the breath of its dawn. The true\nlover was suffering for the sins of the false. This inconsistency is unfortunately only to be expected so\nlong as men do not know how many flowers are mown down in a young woman's soul by the first stroke\n\nof treachery.\nWhatever her reasons may have been, Delphine was playing with Rastignac, and took pleasure in\nplaying with him, doubtless because she felt sure of his love, and confident that she could put an end to\nthe torture as soon as it was her royal pleasure to do so. Eugene's self-love was engaged; he could not\nsuffer his first passage of love to end in a defeat, and persisted in his suit like a sportsman determined to\nbring down at least one partridge to celebrate his first Feast of Saint-Hubert. The pressure of anxiety, his\nwounded self-love, his despair, real or feigned, drew him nearer and nearer to this woman. All Paris\ncredited him with this conquest, and yet he was conscious that he had made no progress since the day\nwhen he saw Mme. de Nucingen for the first time. He did not know as yet that a woman's coquetry is\nsometimes more delightful than the pleasure of secure possession of her love, and was possessed with\nhelpless rage. If, at this time, while she denied herself to love, Eugene gathered the springtide spoils of his\nlife, the fruit, somewhat sharp and green, and dearly bought, was no less delicious to the taste. There were\nmoments when he had not a sou in his pockets, and at such times he thought in spite of his conscience of\nVautrin's offer and the possibility of fortune by a marriage with Mlle. Taillefer. Poverty would clamor so\nloudly that more than once he was on the point of yielding to the cunning temptations of the terrible\nsphinx, whose glance had so often exerted a strange spell over him.\nPoiret and Mlle. Michonneau went up to their rooms; and Rastignac, thinking that he was alone\nwith the women in the dining-room, sat between Mme. Vauquer and Mme. Couture, who was nodding\nover the woolen cuffs that she was knitting by the stove, and looked at Mlle. Taillefer so tenderly that she\nlowered her eyes.\n\"Can you be in trouble, M. Eugene?\" Victorine said after a pause.\n\"Who has not his troubles?\" answered Rastignac. \"If we men were sure of being loved, sure of a\ndevotion which would be our reward for the sacrifices which we are always ready to make, then perhaps\nwe should have no troubles.\"\nFor answer Mlle. Taillefer only gave him a glance but it was impossible to mistake its meaning.\n\"You, for instance, mademoiselle; you feel sure of your heart to-day, but are you sure that it will\nnever change?\"\nA smile flitted over the poor girl's lips; it seemed as if a ray of light from her soul had lighted up\nher face. Eugene was dismayed at the sudden explosion of feeling caused by his words.\n\"Ah! but suppose,\" he said, \"that you should be rich and happy to-morrow, suppose that a vast\nfortune dropped down from the clouds for you, would you still love the man whom you loved in your\ndays of poverty?\"\nA charming movement of the head was her only answer.\n\"Even if he were very poor?\"\nAgain the same mute answer.\n\"What nonsense are you talking, you two?\" exclaimed Mme. Vauquer.\n\n\"Never mind,\" answered Eugene; \"we understand each other.\"\n\"So there is to be an engagement of marriage between M. le Chevalier Eugene de Rastignac and\nMlle. Victorine Taillefer, is there?\" The words were uttered in Vautrin's deep voice, and Vautrin appeared\nat the door as he spoke.\n\"Oh! how you startled me!\" Mme. Couture and Mme. Vauquer exclaimed together.\n\"I might make a worse choice,\" said Rastignac, laughing. Vautrin's voice had thrown him into the\nmost painful agitation that he had yet known.\n\"No bad jokes, gentlemen!\" said Mme. Couture. \"My dear, let us go upstairs.\"\nMme. Vauquer followed the two ladies, meaning to pass the evening in their room, an\narrangement that economized fire and candlelight. Eugene and Vautrin were left alone.\n\"I felt sure you would come round to it,\" said the elder man with the coolness that nothing\nseemed to shake. \"But stay a moment! I have as much delicacy as anybody else. Don't make up your mind\non the spur of the moment; you are a little thrown off your balance just now. You are in debt, and I want\nyou to come over to my way of thinking after sober reflection, and not in a fit of passion or desperation.\nPerhaps you want a thousand crowns. There, you can have them if you like.\"\nThe tempter took out a pocketbook, and drew thence three banknotes, which he fluttered before\nthe student's eyes. Eugene was in a most painful dilemma. He had debts, debts of honor. He owed a\nhundred louis to the Marquis d'Ajuda and to the Count de Trailles; he had not the money, and for this\nreason had not dared to go to Mme. de Restaud's house, where he was expected that evening. It was one\nof those informal gatherings where tea and little cakes are handed round, but where it is possible to lose\nsix thousand francs at whist in the course of a night.\n\"You must see,\" said Eugene, struggling to hide a convulsive tremor, \"that after what has passed\nbetween us, I cannot possibly lay myself under any obligation to you.\"\n\"Quite right; I should be sorry to hear you speak otherwise,\" answered the tempter. \"You are a\nfine young fellow, honorable, brave as a lion, and as gentle as a young girl. You would be a fine haul for\nthe devil! I like youngsters of your sort. Get rid of one or two more prejudices, and you will see the world\nas it is. Make a little scene now and then, and act a virtuous part in it, and a man with a head on his\nshoulders can do exactly as he likes amid deafening applause from the fools in the gallery. Ah! a few days\nyet, and you will be with us; and if you would only be tutored by me, I would put you in the way of\nachieving all your ambitions. You should no sooner form a wish than it should be realized to the full; you\nshould have all your desires--honors, wealth, or women. Civilization should flow with milk and honey for\nyou. You should be our pet and favorite, our Benjamin. We would all work ourselves to death for you\nwith pleasure; every obstacle should be removed from your path. You have a few prejudices left; so you\nthink that I am a scoundrel, do you? Well, M. de Turenne, quite as honorable a man as you take yourself\nto be, had some little private transactions with bandits, and did not feel that his honor was tarnished. You\nwould rather not lie under any obligation to me, eh? You need not draw back on that account,\" Vautrin\nwent on, and a smile stole over his lips. \"Take these bits of paper and write across this,\" he added,\nproducing a piece of stamped paper, \"_Accepted the sum of three thousand five hundred francs due this\nday twelvemonth_, and fill in the date. The rate of interest is stiff enough to silence any scruples on your\npart; it gives you the right to call me a Jew. You can call quits with me on the score of gratitude. I am\n\nquite willing that you should despise me to-day, because I am sure that you will have a kindlier feeling\ntowards me later on. You will find out fathomless depths in my nature, enormous and concentrated forces\nthat weaklings call vices, but you will never find me base or ungrateful. In short, I am neither a pawn nor\na bishop, but a castle, a tower of strength, my boy.\"\n\"What manner of man are you?\" cried Eugene. \"Were you created to torment me?\"\n\"Why no; I am a good-natured fellow, who is willing to do a dirty piece of work to put you high\nand dry above the mire for the rest of your days. Do you ask the reason of this devotion? All right; I will\ntell you that some of these days. A word or two in your ear will explain it. I have begun by shocking you,\nby showing you the way to ring the changes, and giving you a sight of the mechanism of the social\nmachine; but your first fright will go off like a conscript's terror on the battlefield. You will grow used to\nregarding men as common soldiers who have made up their minds to lose their lives for some\nself-constituted king. Times have altered strangely. Once you could say to a bravo, 'Here are a hundred\ncrowns; go and kill Monsieur So-and-so for me,' and you could sup quietly after turning some one off into\nthe dark for the least thing in the world. But nowadays I propose to put you in the way of a handsome\nfortune; you have only to nod your head, it won't compromise you in any way, and you hesitate. 'Tis an\neffeminate age.\"\nEugene accepted the draft, and received the banknotes in exchange for it.\n\"Well, well. Come, now, let us talk rationally,\" Vautrin continued. \"I mean to leave this country\nin a few months' time for America, and set about planting tobacco. I will send you the cigars of\nfriendship. If I make money at it, I will help you in your career. If I have no children--which will\nprobably be the case, for I have no anxiety to raise slips of myself here--you shall inherit my fortune. That\nis what you may call standing by a man; but I myself have a liking for you. I have a mania, too, for\ndevoting myself to some one else. I have done it before. You see, my boy, I live in a loftier sphere than\nother men do; I look on all actions as means to an end, and the end is all that I look at. What is a man's\nlife to me? Not _that_,\" he said, and he snapped his thumb-nail against his teeth. \"A man, in short, is\neverything to me, or just nothing at all. Less than nothing if his name happens to be Poiret; you can crush\nhim like a bug, he is flat and he is offensive. But a man is a god when he is like you; he is not a machine\ncovered with a skin, but a theatre in which the greatest sentiments are displayed--great thoughts and\nfeelings--and for these, and these only, I live. A sentiment--what is that but the whole world in a thought?\nLook at Father Goriot. For him, his two girls are the whole universe; they are the clue by which he finds\nhis way through creation. Well, for my own part, I have fathomed the depths of life, there is only one real\nsentiment--comradeship between man and man. Pierre and Jaffier, that is my passion. I knew _Venice\nPreserved_ by heart. Have you met many men plucky enough when a comrade says, 'Let us bury a dead\nbody!' to go and do it without a word or plaguing him by taking a high moral tone? I have done it myself.\nI should not talk like this to just everybody, but you are not like an ordinary man; one can talk to you, you\ncan understand things. You will not dabble about much longer among the tadpoles in these swamps. Well,\nthen, it is all settled. You will marry. Both of us carry our point. Mine is made of iron, and will never\nsoften, he! he!\"\nVautrin went out. He would not wait to hear the student's repudiation, he wished to put Eugene at\nhis ease. He seemed to understand the secret springs of the faint resistance still made by the younger man;\nthe struggles in which men seek to preserve their self-respect by justifying their blameworthy actions to\nthemselves.\n\"He may do as he likes; I shall not marry Mlle. Taillefer, that is certain,\" said Eugene to himself.\n\nHe regarded this man with abhorrence, and yet the very cynicism of Vautrin's ideas, and the\naudacious way in which he used other men for his own ends, raised him in the student's eyes; but the\nthought of a compact threw Eugene into a fever of apprehension, and not until he had recovered\nsomewhat did he dress, call for a cab, and go to Mme. de Restaud's.\nFor some days the Countess had paid more and more attention to a young man whose every step\nseemed a triumphal progress in the great world; it seemed to her that he might be a formidable power\nbefore long. He paid Messieurs de Trailles and d'Ajuda, played at whist for part of the evening, and made\ngood his losses. Most men who have their way to make are more or less of fatalists, and Eugene was\nsuperstitious; he chose to consider that his luck was heaven's reward for his perseverance in the right way.\nAs soon as possible on the following morning he asked Vautrin whether the bill he had given was still in\nthe other's possession; and on receiving a reply in the affirmative, he repaid the three thousand francs with\na not unnatural relief.\n\"Everything is going on well,\" said Vautrin.\n\"But I am not your accomplice,\" said Eugene.\n\"I know, I know,\" Vautrin broke in. \"You are still acting like a child. You are making mountains\nout of molehills at the outset.\"\nTwo days later, Poiret and Mlle. Michonneau were sitting together on a bench in the sun. They\nhad chosen a little frequented alley in the Jardin des Plantes, and a gentleman was chatting with them, the\nsame person, as a matter of fact, about whom the medical student had, not without good reason, his own\nsuspicions.\n\"Mademoiselle,\" this M. Gondureau was saying, \"I do not see any cause for your scruples. His\nExcellency, Monseigneur the Minister of Police----\"\n\"Yes, his Excellency is taking a personal interest in the matter,\" said Gondureau.\nWho would think it probable that Poiret, a retired clerk, doubtless possessed of some notions of\ncivic virtue, though there might be nothing else in his head--who would think it likely that such a man\nwould continue to lend an ear to this supposed independent gentleman of the Rue de Buffon, when the\nlatter dropped the mask of a decent citizen by that word \"police,\" and gave a glimpse of the features of a\ndetective from the Rue de Jerusalem? And yet nothing was more natural. Perhaps the following remarks\nfrom the hitherto unpublished records made by certain observers will throw a light on the particular\nspecies to which Poiret belonged in the great family of fools. There is a race of quill-drivers, confined in\nthe columns of the budget between the first degree of latitude (a kind of administrative Greenland where\nthe salaries begin at twelve hundred francs) to the third degree, a more temperate zone, where incomes\ngrow from three to six thousand francs, a climate where the _bonus_ flourishes like a half-hardy annual in\nspite of some difficulties of culture. A characteristic trait that best reveals the feeble narrow-mindedness\nof these inhabitants of petty officialdom is a kind of involuntary, mechanical, and instinctive reverence\nfor the Grand Lama of every Ministry, known to the rank and file only by his signature (an illegible\nscrawl) and by his title--\"His Excellency Monseigneur le Ministre,\" five words which produce as much\neffect as the _il Bondo Cani_ of the _Calife de Bagdad_, five words which in the eyes of this low order of\nintelligence represent a sacred power from which there is no appeal. The Minister is administratively\ninfallible for the clerks in the employ of the Government, as the Pope is infallible for good Catholics.\nSomething of this peculiar radiance invests everything he does or says, or that is said or done in his name;\n\nthe robe of office covers everything and legalizes everything done by his orders; does not his very\ntitle--His Excellency--vouch for the purity of his intentions and the righteousness of his will, and serve as\na sort of passport and introduction to ideas that otherwise would not be entertained for a moment?\nPronounce the words \"His Excellency,\" and these poor folk will forthwith proceed to do what they would\nnot do for their own interests. Passive obedience is as well known in a Government department as in the\narmy itself; and the administrative system silences consciences, annihilates the individual, and ends (give\nit time enough) by fashioning a man into a vise or a thumbscrew, and he becomes part of the machinery\nof Government. Wherefore, M. Gondureau, who seemed to know something of human nature, recognized\nPoiret at once as one of those dupes of officialdom, and brought out for his benefit, at the proper moment,\nthe _deus ex machina_, the magical words \"His Excellency,\" so as to dazzle Poiret just as he himself\nunmasked his batteries, for he took Poiret and the Michonneau for the male and female of the same\nspecies.\n\"If his Excellency himself, his Excellency the Minister . . . Ah! that is quite another thing,\" said\nPoiret.\n\"You seem to be guided by this gentleman's opinion, and you hear what he says,\" said the man of\nindependent means, addressing Mlle. Michonneau. \"Very well, his Excellency is at this moment\nabsolutely certain that the so-called Vautrin, who lodges at the Maison Vauquer, is a convict who escaped\nfrom penal servitude at Toulon, where he is known by the nickname _Trompe-la-Mort_.\"\n\"Trompe-la-Mort?\" said Pioret. \"Dear me, he is very lucky if he deserves that nickname.\"\n\"Well, yes,\" said the detective. \"They call him so because he has been so lucky as not to lose his\nlife in the very risky businesses that he has carried through. He is a dangerous man, you see! He has\nqualities that are out of the common; the thing he is wanted for, in fact, was a matter which gained him no\nend of credit with his own set----\"\n\"Then is he a man of honor?\" asked Poiret.\n\"Yes, according to his notions. He agreed to take another man's crime upon himself--a forgery\ncommitted by a very handsome young fellow that he had taken a great fancy to, a young Italian, a bit of a\ngambler, who has since gone into the army, where his conduct has been unexceptionable.\"\n\"But if his Excellency the Minister of Police is certain that M. Vautrin is this _Trompe-la-Mort_,\nwhy should he want me?\" asked Mlle. Michonneau.\n\"Oh yes,\" said Poiret, \"if the Minister, as you have been so obliging as to tell us, really knows for\na certainty----\"\n\"Certainty is not the word; he only suspects. You will soon understand how things are. Jacques\nCollin, nicknamed _Trompe-la-Mort_, is in the confidence of every convict in the three prisons; he is\ntheir man of business and their banker. He makes a very good thing out of managing their affairs, which\nwant a _man of mark_ to see about them.\"\n\"Ha! ha! do you see the pun, mademoiselle?\" asked Poiret. \"This gentleman calls himself a _man\nof mark_ because he is a _marked man_ --branded, you know.\"\n\"This so-called Vautrin,\" said the detective, \"receives the money belonging to my lords the\n\nconvicts, invests it for them, and holds it at the disposal of those who escape, or hands it over to their\nfamilies if they leave a will, or to their mistresses when they draw upon him for their benefit.\"\n\"Their mistresses! You mean their wives,\" remarked Poiret.\n\"No, sir. A convict's wife is usually an illegitimate connection. We call them concubines.\"\n\"Then they all live in a state of concubinage?\"\n\"Naturally.\"\n\"Why, these are abominations that his Excellency ought not to allow. Since you have the honor of\nseeing his Excellency, you, who seem to have philanthropic ideas, ought really to enlighten him as to\ntheir immoral conduct--they are setting a shocking example to the rest of society.\"\n\"But the Government does not hold them up as models of all the virtues, my dear sir----\"\n\"Of course not, sir; but still----\"\n\"Just let the gentleman say what he has to say, dearie,\" said Mlle. Michonneau.\n\"You see how it is, mademoiselle,\" Gondureau continued. \"The Government may have the\nstrongest reasons for getting this illicit hoard into its hands; it mounts up to something considerable, by all\nthat we can make out. Trompe-la-Mort not only holds large sums for his friends the convicts, but he has\nother amounts which are paid over to him by the Society of the Ten Thousand----\"\n\"Ten Thousand Thieves!\" cried Pioret in alarm.\n\"No. The Society of the Ten Thousand is not an association of petty offenders, but of people who\nset about their work on a large scale --they won't touch a matter unless there are ten thousand francs in it.\nIt is composed of the most distinguished of the men who are sent straight to the Assize Courts when they\ncome up for trial. They know the Code too well to risk their necks when they are nabbed. Collin is their\nconfidential agent and legal adviser. By means of the large sums of money at his disposal he has\nestablished a sort of detective system of his own; it is widespread and mysterious in its workings. We\nhave had spies all about him for a twelvemonth, and yet we could not manage to fathom his games. His\ncapital and his cleverness are at the service of vice and crime; this money furnishes the necessary funds\nfor a regular army of blackguards in his pay who wage incessant war against society. If we can catch\nTrompe-la-Mort, and take possession of his funds, we should strike at the root of this evil. So this job is a\nkind of Government affair--a State secret--and likely to redound to the honor of those who bring the thing\nto a successful conclusion. You, sir, for instance, might very well be taken into a Government department\nagain; they might make you secretary to a Commissary of Police; you could accept that post without\nprejudice to your retiring pension.\"\nMlle. Michonneau interposed at this point with, \"What is there to hinder Trompe-la-Mort from\nmaking off with the money?\"\n\"Oh!\" said the detective, \"a man is told off to follow him everywhere he goes, with orders to kill\nhim if he were to rob the convicts. Then it is not quite as easy to make off with a lot of money as it is to\nrun away with a young lady of family. Besides, Collin is not the sort of fellow to play such a trick; he\n\nwould be disgraced, according to his notions.\"\n\"You are quite right, sir,\" said Poiret, \"utterly disgraced he would be.\"\n\"But none of all this explains why you do not come and take him without more ado,\" remarked\nMlle. Michonneau.\n\"Very well, mademoiselle, I will explain--but,\" he added in her ear, \"keep your companion quiet,\nor I shall never have done. The old boy ought to pay people handsomely for listening to\nhim.--Trompe-la-Mort, when he came back here,\" he went on aloud \"slipped into the skin of an honest\nman; he turned up disguised as a decent Parisian citizen, and took up his quarters in an unpretending\nlodging-house. He is cunning, that he is! You don't catch him napping. Then M. Vautrin is a man of\nconsequence, who transacts a good deal of business.\"\n\"Naturally,\" said Poiret to himself.\n\"And suppose that the Minister were to make a mistake and get hold of the real Vautrin, he would\nput every one's back up among the business men in Paris, and public opinion would be against him. M. le\nPrefet de Police is on slippery ground; he has enemies. They would take advantage of any mistake. There\nwould be a fine outcry and fuss made by the Opposition, and he would be sent packing. We must set\nabout this just as we did about the Coignard affair, the sham Comte de Sainte-Helene; if he had been the\nreal Comte de Sainte-Helene, we should have been in the wrong box. We want to be quite sure what we\nare about.\"\n\"Yes, but what you want is a pretty woman,\" said Mlle. Michonneau briskly.\n\"Trompe-la-Mort would not let a woman come near him,\" said the detective. \"I will tell you a\nsecret--he does not like them.\"\n\"Still, I do not see what I can do, supposing that I did agree to identify him for two thousand\nfrancs.\"\n\"Nothing simpler,\" said the stranger. \"I will send you a little bottle containing a dose that will\nsend a rush of blood to the head; it will do him no harm whatever, but he will fall down as if he were in a\nfit. The drug can be put into wine or coffee; either will do equally well. You carry your man to bed at\nonce, and undress him to see that he is not dying. As soon as you are alone, you give him a slap on the\nshoulder, and _presto!_ the letters will appear.\"\n\"Why, that is just nothing at all,\" said Poiret.\n\"Well, do you agree?\" said Gondureau, addressing the old maid.\n\"But, my dear sir, suppose there are no letters at all,\" said Mlle. Michonneau; \"am I to have the\ntwo thousand francs all the same?\"\n\"No.\"\n\"What will you give me then?\"\n\n\"Five hundred francs.\"\n\"It is such a thing to do for so little! It lies on your conscience just the same, and I must quiet my\nconscience, sir.\"\n\"I assure you,\" said Poiret, \"that mademoiselle has a great deal of conscience, and not only so, she\nis a very amiable person, and very intelligent.\"\n\"Well, now,\" Mlle. Michonneau went on, \"make it three thousand francs if he is Trompe-la-Mort,\nand nothing at all if he is an ordinary man.\"\n\"Done!\" said Gondureau, \"but on the condition that the thing is settled to-morrow.\"\n\"Not quite so soon, my dear sir; I must consult my confessor first.\"\n\"You are a sly one,\" said the detective as he rose to his feet. \"Good-bye till to-morrow, then. And\nif you should want to see me in a hurry, go to the Petite Rue Saint-Anne at the bottom of the Cour de la\nSainte-Chapelle. There is one door under the archway. Ask there for M. Gondureau.\"\nBianchon, on his way back from Cuvier's lecture, overheard the sufficiently striking nickname of\n_Trompe-la-Mort_, and caught the celebrated chief detective's \"_Done!_\"\n\"Why didn't you close with him? It would be three hundred francs a year,\" said Poiret to Mlle.\nMichonneau.\n\"Why didn't I?\" she asked. \"Why, it wants thinking over. Suppose that M. Vautrin is this\nTrompe-la-Mort, perhaps we might do better for ourselves with him. Still, on the other hand, if you ask\nhim for money, it would put him on his guard, and he is just the man to clear out without paying, and that\nwould be an abominable sell.\"\n\"And suppose you did warn him,\" Poiret went on, \"didn't that gentleman say that he was closely\nwatched? You would spoil everything.\"\n\"Anyhow,\" thought Mlle. Michonneau, \"I can't abide him. He says nothing but disagreeable\nthings to me.\"\n\"But you can do better than that,\" Poiret resumed. \"As that gentleman said (and he seemed to me\nto be a very good sort of man, besides being very well got up), it is an act of obedience to the laws to rid\nsociety of a criminal, however virtuous he may be. Once a thief, always a thief. Suppose he were to take it\ninto his head to murder us all? The deuce! We should be guilty of manslaughter, and be the first to fall\nvictims into the bargain!\"\nMlle. Michonneau's musings did not permit her to listen very closely to the remarks that fell one\nby one from Poiret's lips like water dripping from a leaky tap. When once this elderly babbler began to\ntalk, he would go on like clockwork unless Mlle. Michonneau stopped him. He started on some subject or\nother, and wandered on through parenthesis after parenthesis, till he came to regions as remote as possible\nfrom his premises without coming to any conclusions by the way.\nBy the time they reached the Maison Vauquer he had tacked together a whole string of examples\n\nand quotations more or less irrelevant to the subject in hand, which led him to give a full account of his\nown deposition in the case of the Sieur Ragoulleau _versus_ Dame Morin, when he had been summoned\nas a witness for the defence.\nAs they entered the dining-room, Eugene de Rastignac was talking apart with Mlle. Taillefer; the\nconversation appeared to be of such thrilling interest that the pair never noticed the two older lodgers as\nthey passed through the room. None of this was thrown away on Mlle. Michonneau.\n\"I knew how it would end,\" remarked that lady, addressing Poiret. \"They have been making eyes\nat each other in a heartrending way for a week past.\"\n\"Yes,\" he answered. \"So she was found guilty.\"\n\"Who?\"\n\"Mme. Morin.\"\n\"I am talking about Mlle. Victorine,\" said Mlle, Michonneau, as she entered Poiret's room with an\nabsent air, \"and you answer, 'Mme. Morin.' Who may Mme. Morin be?\"\n\"What can Mlle. Victorine be guilty of?\" demanded Poiret.\n\"Guilty of falling in love with M. Eugene de Rastignac and going further and further without\nknowing exactly where she is going, poor innocent!\"\nThat morning Mme. de Nucingen had driven Eugene to despair. In his own mind he had\ncompletely surrendered himself to Vautrin, and deliberately shut his eyes to the motive for the friendship\nwhich that extraordinary man professed for him, nor would he look to the consequences of such an\nalliance. Nothing short of a miracle could extricate him now out of the gulf into which he had walked an\nhour ago, when he exchanged vows in the softest whispers with Mlle. Taillefer. To Victorine it seemed as\nif she heard an angel's voice, that heaven was opening above her; the Maison Vauquer took strange and\nwonderful hues, like a stage fairy-palace. She loved and she was loved; at any rate, she believed that she\nwas loved; and what woman would not likewise have believed after seeing Rastignac's face and listening\nto the tones of his voice during that hour snatched under the Argus eyes of the Maison Vauquer? He had\ntrampled on his conscience; he knew that he was doing wrong, and did it deliberately; he had said to\nhimself that a woman's happiness should atone for this venial sin. The energy of desperation had lent new\nbeauty to his face; the lurid fire that burned in his heart shone from his eyes. Luckily for him, the miracle\ntook place. Vautrin came in in high spirits, and at once read the hearts of these two young creatures whom\nhe had brought together by the combinations of his infernal genius, but his deep voice broke in upon their\nbliss.\n\"A charming girl is my Fanchette\nIn her simplicity,\"\nhe sang mockingly.\nVictorine fled. Her heart was more full than it had ever been, but it was full of joy, and not of\nsorrow. Poor child! A pressure of the hand, the light touch of Rastignac's hair against her cheek, a word\n\nwhispered in her ear so closely that she felt the student's warm breath on her, the pressure of a trembling\narm about her waist, a kiss upon her throat--such had been her betrothal. The near neighborhood of the\nstout Sylvie, who might invade that glorified room at any moment, only made these first tokens of love\nmore ardent, more eloquent, more entrancing than the noblest deeds done for love's sake in the most\nfamous romances. This _plain-song_ of love, to use the pretty expression of our forefathers, seemed\nalmost criminal to the devout young girl who went to confession every fortnight. In that one hour she had\npoured out more of the treasures of her soul than she could give in later days of wealth and happiness,\nwhen her whole self followed the gift.\n\"The thing is arranged,\" Vautrin said to Eugene, who remained. \"Our two dandies have fallen out.\nEverything was done in proper form. It is a matter of opinion. Our pigeon has insulted my hawk. They\nwill meet to-morrow in the redoubt at Clignancourt. By half-past eight in the morning Mlle. Taillefer,\ncalmly dipping her bread and butter in her coffee cup, will be sole heiress of her father's fortune and\naffections. A funny way of putting it, isn't it? Taillefer's youngster is an expert swordsman, and quite\ncocksure about it, but he will be bled; I have just invented a thrust for his benefit, a way of raising your\nsword point and driving it at the forehead. I must show you that thrust; it is an uncommonly handy thing\nto know.\"\nRastignac heard him in dazed bewilderment; he could not find a word in reply. Just then Goriot\ncame in, and Bianchon and a few of the boarders likewise appeared.\n\"That is just as I intended.\" Vautrin said. \"You know quite well what you are about. Good, my\nlittle eaglet! You are born to command, you are strong, you stand firm on your feet, you are game! I\nrespect you.\"\nHe made as though he would take Eugene's hand, but Rastignac hastily withdrew it, sank into a\nchair, and turned ghastly pale; it seemed to him that there was a sea of blood before his eyes.\n\"Oh! so we still have a few dubious tatters of the swaddling clothes of virtue about us!\"\nmurmured Vautrin. \"But Papa Doliban has three millions; I know the amount of his fortune. Once have\nher dowry in your hands, and your character will be as white as the bride's white dress, even in your own\neyes.\"\nRastignac hesitated no longer. He made up his mind that he would go that evening to warn the\nTaillefers, father and son. But just as Vautrin left him, Father Goriot came up and said in his ear, \"You\nlook melancholy, my boy; I will cheer you up. Come with me.\"\nThe old vermicelli dealer lighted his dip at one of the lamps as he spoke. Eugene went with him,\nhis curiosity had been aroused.\n\"Let us go up to your room,\" the worthy soul remarked, when he had asked Sylvie for the law\nstudent's key. \"This morning,\" he resumed, \"you thought that _she_ did not care about you, did you not?\nEh? She would have nothing to say to you, and you went away out of humor and out of heart. Stuff and\nrubbish! She wanted you to go because she was expecting _me_! Now do you understand? We were to\ncomplete the arrangements for taking some chambers for you, a jewel of a place, you are to move into it\nin three days' time. Don't split upon me. She wants it to be a surprise; but I couldn't bear to keep the secret\nfrom you. You will be in the Rue d'Artois, only a step or two from the Rue Saint-Lazare, and you are to\nbe housed like a prince! Any one might have thought we were furnishing the house for a bride. Oh! we\nhave done a lot of things in the last month, and you knew nothing about it. My attorney has appeared on\n\nthe scene, and my daughter is to have thirty-six thousand francs a year, the interest on her money, and I\nshall insist on having her eight hundred thousand invested in sound securities, landed property that won't\nrun away.\"\nEugene was dumb. He folded his arms and paced up and down in his cheerless, untidy room.\nFather Goriot waited till the student's back was turned, and seized the opportunity to go to the\nchimney-piece and set upon it a little red morocco case with Rastignac's arms stamped in gold on the\nleather.\n\"My dear boy,\" said the kind soul, \"I have been up to the eyes in this business. You see, there was\nplenty of selfishness on my part; I have an interested motive in helping you to change lodgings. You will\nnot refuse me if I ask you something; will you, eh?\"\n\"What is it?\"\n\"There is a room on the fifth floor, up above your rooms, that is to let along with them; that is\nwhere I am going to live, isn't that so? I am getting old: I am too far from my girls. I shall not be in the\nway, but I shall be there, that is all. You will come and talk to me about her every evening. It will not put\nyou about, will it? I shall have gone to bed before you come in, but I shall hear you come up, and I shall\nsay to myself, 'He has just seen my little Delphine. He has been to a dance with her, and she is happy,\nthanks to him.' If I were ill, it would do my heart good to hear you moving about below, to know when\nyou leave the house and when you come in. It is only a step to the Champs-Elysees, where they go every\nday, so I shall be sure of seeing them, whereas now I am sometimes too late. And then--perhaps she may\ncome to see you! I shall hear her, I shall see her in her soft quilted pelisse tripping about as daintily as a\nkitten. In this one month she has become my little girl again, so light-hearted and gay. Her soul is\nrecovering, and her happiness is owing to you! Oh! I would do impossibilities for you. Only just now she\nsaid to me, 'I am very happy, papa!' When they say 'father' stiffly, it sends a chill through me; but when\nthey call me 'papa,' it brings all the old memories back. I feel most their father then; I even believe that\nthey belong to me, and to no one else.\"\nThe good man wiped his eyes, he was crying.\n\"It is a long while since I have heard them talk like that, a long, long time since she took my arm\nas she did to-day. Yes, indeed, it must be quite ten years since I walked side by side with one of my girls.\nHow pleasant it was to keep step with her, to feel the touch of her gown, the warmth of her arm! Well, I\ntook Delphine everywhere this morning; I went shopping with her, and I brought her home again. Oh!\nyou must let me live near you. You may want some one to do you a service some of these days, and I\nshall be on the spot to do it. Oh! if only that great dolt of an Alsatian would die, if his gout would have\nthe sense to attack his stomach, how happy my poor child would be! You would be my son-in-law; you\nwould be her husband in the eyes of the world. Bah! she has known no happiness, that excuses\neverything. Our Father in heaven is surely on the side of fathers on earth who love their children. How\nfond of you she is!\" he said, raising his head after a pause. \"All the time we were going about together she\nchatted away about you. 'He is so nice-looking, papa; isn't he? He is kind-hearted! Does he talk to you\nabout me?' Pshaw! she said enough about you to fill whole volumes; between the Rue d'Artois and the\nPassage des Panoramas she poured her heart out into mine. I did not feel old once during that delightful\nmorning; I felt as light as a feather. I told her how you had given the banknote to me; it moved my darling\nto tears. But what can this be on your chimney-piece?\" said Father Goriot at last. Rastignac had showed\nno sign, and he was dying of impatience.\n\nEugene stared at his neighbor in dumb and dazed bewilderment. He thought of Vautrin, of that\nduel to be fought to-morrow morning, and of this realization of his dearest hopes, and the violent contrast\nbetween the two sets of ideas gave him all the sensations of nightmare. He went to the chimney-piece,\nsaw the little square case, opened it, and found a watch of Breguet's make wrapped in paper, on which\nthese words were written:\n\"I want you to think of me every hour, _because_ . . .\n\"DELPHINE.\"\nThat last word doubtless contained an allusion to some scene that had taken place between them.\nEugene felt touched. Inside the gold watch-case his arms had been wrought in enamel. The chain, the key,\nthe workmanship and design of the trinket were all such as he had imagined, for he had long coveted such\na possession. Father Goriot was radiant. Of course he had promised to tell his daughter every little detail\nof the scene and of the effect produced upon Eugene by her present; he shared in the pleasure and\nexcitement of the young people, and seemed to be not the least happy of the three. He loved Rastignac\nalready for his own as well as for his daughter's sake.\n\"You must go and see her; she is expecting you this evening. That great lout of an Alsatian is\ngoing to have supper with his opera-dancer. Aha! he looked very foolish when my attorney let him know\nwhere he was. He says he idolizes my daughter, does he? He had better let her alone, or I will kill him. To\nthink that my Delphine is his\" --he heaved a sigh--\"it is enough to make me murder him, but it would not\nbe manslaughter to kill that animal; he is a pig with a calf's brains.--You will take me with you, will you\nnot?\"\n\"Yes, dear Father Goriot; you know very well how fond I am of you----\"\n\"Yes, I do know very well. You are not ashamed of me, are you? Not you! Let me embrace you,\"\nand he flung his arms around the student's neck.\n\"You will make her very happy; promise me that you will! You will go to her this evening, will\nyou not?\"\n\"Oh! yes. I must go out; I have some urgent business on hand.\"\n\"Can I be of any use?\"\n\"My word, yes! Will you go to old Taillefer's while I go to Mme. de Nucingen? Ask him to make\nan appointment with me some time this evening; it is a matter of life and death.\"\n\"Really, young man!\" cried Father Goriot, with a change of countenance; \"are you really paying\ncourt to his daughter, as those simpletons were saying down below? . . . _Tonnerre de dieu!_ you have no\nnotion what a tap _a la Goriot_ is like, and if you are playing a double game, I shall put a stop to it by one\nblow of the fist. . . Oh! the thing is impossible!\"\n\"I swear to you that I love but one woman in the world,\" said the student. \"I only knew it a\nmoment ago.\"\n\"Oh! what happiness!\" cried Goriot.\n\n\"But young Taillefer has been called out; the duel comes off to-morrow morning, and I have\nheard it said that he may lose his life in it.\"\n\"But what business is it of yours?\" said Goriot.\n\"Why, I ought to tell him so, that he may prevent his son from putting in an appearance----\"\nJust at that moment Vautrin's voice broke in upon them; he was standing at the threshold of his\ndoor and singing:\n\"Oh! Richard, oh my king!\nAll the world abandons thee!\nBroum! broum! broum!\nbroum! broum!\nThe same old story everywhere,\nA roving heart and a . . . tra la la.\"\n\"Gentlemen!\" shouted Christophe, \"the soup is ready, and every one is waiting for you.\"\n\"Here,\" Vautrin called down to him, \"come and take a bottle of my Bordeaux.\"\n\"Do you think your watch is pretty?\" asked Goriot. \"She has good taste, hasn't she? Eh?\"\nVautrin, Father Goriot, and Rastignac came downstairs in company, and, all three of them being\nlate, were obliged to sit together.\nEugene was as distant as possible in his manner to Vautrin during dinner; but the other, so\ncharming in Mme. Vauquer's opinion, had never been so witty. His lively sallies and sparkling talk put\nthe whole table in good humor. His assurance and coolness filled Eugene with consternation.\n\"Why, what has come to you to-day?\" inquired Mme. Vauquer. \"You are as merry as a skylark.\"\n\"I am always in spirits after I have made a good bargain.\"\n\"Bargain?\" said Eugene.\n\"Well, yes, bargain. I have just delivered a lot of goods, and I shall be paid a handsome\ncommission on them--Mlle. Michonneau,\" he went on, seeing that the elderly spinster was scrutinizing\nhim intently, \"have you any objection to some feature in my face, that you are making those lynx eyes at\nme? Just let me know, and I will have it changed to oblige you . . . We shall not fall out about it, Poiret, I\ndare say?\" he added, winking at the superannuated clerk.\n\"Bless my soul, you ought to stand as model for a burlesque Hercules,\" said the young painter.\n\"I will, upon my word! if Mlle. Michonneau will consent to sit as the Venus of Pere-Lachaise,\"\nreplied Vautrin.\n\"There's Poiret,\" suggested Bianchon.\n\"Oh! Poiret shall pose as Poiret. He can be a garden god!\" cried Vautrin; \"his name means a\npear----\"\n\n\"A sleepy pear!\" Bianchon put in. \"You will come in between the pear and the cheese.\"\n\"What stuff are you all talking!\" said Mme. Vauquer; \"you would do better to treat us to your\nBordeaux; I see a glimpse of a bottle there. It would keep us all in a good humor, and it is good for the\nstomach besides.\"\n\"Gentlemen,\" said Vautrin, \"the Lady President calls us to order. Mme. Couture and Mlle.\nVictorine will take your jokes in good part, but respect the innocence of the aged Goriot. I propose a glass\nor two of Bordeauxrama, rendered twice illustrious by the name of Laffite, no political allusions\nintended.--Come, you Turk!\" he added, looking at Christophe, who did not offer to stir. \"Christophe!\nHere! What, you don't answer to your own name? Bring us some liquor, Turk!\"\n\"Here it is, sir,\" said Christophe, holding out the bottle.\nVautrin filled Eugene's glass and Goriot's likewise, then he deliberately poured out a few drops\ninto his own glass, and sipped it while his two neighbors drank their wine. All at once he made a grimace.\n\"Corked!\" he cried. \"The devil! You can drink the rest of this, Christophe, and go and find\nanother bottle; take from the right-hand side, you know. There are sixteen of us; take down eight bottles.\"\n\"If you are going to stand treat,\" said the painter, \"I will pay for a hundred chestnuts.\"\n\"Oh! oh!\"\n\"Booououh!\"\n\"Prrr!\"\nThese exclamations came from all parts of the table like squibs from a set firework.\n\"Come, now, Mama Vauquer, a couple of bottles of champagne,\" called Vautrin.\n\"_Quien!_ just like you! Why not ask for the whole house at once. A couple of bottles of\nchampagne; that means twelve francs! I shall never see the money back again, I know! But if M. Eugene\nhas a mind to pay for it, I have some currant cordial.\"\n\"That currant cordial of hers is as bad as a black draught,\" muttered the medical student.\n\"Shut up, Bianchon,\" exclaimed Rastignac; \"the very mention of black draught makes me feel----.\nYes, champagne, by all means; I will pay for it,\" he added.\n\"Sylvie,\" called Mme. Vauquer, \"bring in some biscuits, and the little cakes.\"\n\"Those little cakes are mouldy graybeards,\" said Vautrin. \"But trot out the biscuits.\"\nThe Bordeaux wine circulated; the dinner table became a livelier scene than ever, and the fun\ngrew fast and furious. Imitations of the cries of various animals mingled with the loud laughter; the\nMuseum official having taken it into his head to mimic a cat-call rather like the caterwauling of the\nanimal in question, eight voices simultaneously struck up with the following variations:\n\n\"Scissors to grind!\"\n\"Chick-weeds for singing bir-ds!\"\n\"Brandy-snaps, ladies!\"\n\"China to mend!\"\n\"Boat ahoy!\"\n\"Sticks to beat your wives or your clothes!\"\n\"Old clo'!\"\n\"Cherries all ripe!\"\nBut the palm was awarded to Bianchon for the nasal accent with which he rendered the cry of\n\"Umbrellas to me-end!\"\nA few seconds later, and there was a head-splitting racket in the room, a storm of tomfoolery, a\nsort of cats' concert, with Vautrin as conductor of the orchestra, the latter keeping an eye the while on\nEugene and Father Goriot. The wine seemed to have gone to their heads already. They leaned back in\ntheir chairs, looking at the general confusion with an air of gravity, and drank but little; both of them were\nabsorbed in the thought of what lay before them to do that evening, and yet neither of them felt able to\nrise and go. Vautrin gave a side glance at them from time to time, and watched the change that came over\ntheir faces, choosing the moment when their eyes drooped and seemed about to close, to bend over\nRastignac and to say in his ear:--\n\"My little lad, you are not quite shrewd enough to outwit Papa Vautrin yet, and he is too fond of\nyou to let you make a mess of your affairs. When I have made up my mind to do a thing, no one short of\nProvidence can put me off. Aha! we were for going round to warn old Taillefer, telling tales out of\nschool! The oven is hot, the dough is kneaded, the bread is ready for the oven; to-morrow we will eat it\nup and whisk away the crumbs; and we are not going to spoil the baking? . . . No, no, it is all as good as\ndone! We may suffer from a few conscientious scruples, but they will be digested along with the bread.\nWhile we are having our forty winks, Colonel Count Franchessini will clear the way to Michel Taillefer's\ninheritance with the point of his sword. Victorine will come in for her brother's money, a snug fifteen\nthousand francs a year. I have made inquiries already, and I know that her late mother's property amounts\nto more than three hundred thousand----\"\nEugene heard all this, and could not answer a word; his tongue seemed to be glued to the roof of\nhis mouth, an irresistible drowsiness was creeping over him. He still saw the table and the faces round it,\nbut it was through a bright mist. Soon the noise began to subside, one by one the boarders went. At last,\nwhen their numbers had so dwindled that the party consisted of Mme. Vauquer, Mme. Couture, Mlle.\nVictorine, Vautrin, and Father Goriot, Rastignac watched as though in a dream how Mme. Vauquer\nbusied herself by collecting the bottles, and drained the remainder of the wine out of each to fill others.\n\"Oh! how uproarious they are! what a thing it is to be young!\" said the widow.\nThese were the last words that Eugene heard and understood.\n\n\"There is no one like M. Vautrin for a bit of fun like this,\" said Sylvie. \"There, just hark at\nChristophe, he is snoring like a top.\"\n\"Good-bye, mamma,\" said Vautrin; \"I am going to a theatre on the boulevard to see M. Marty in\n_Le Mont Sauvage_, a fine play taken from _Le Solitaire_. . . . If you like, I will take you and these two\nladies----\"\n\"Thank you; I must decline,\" said Mme. Couture.\n\"What! my good lady!\" cried Mme. Vauquer, \"decline to see a play founded on the _Le\nSolitaire_, a work by Atala de Chateaubriand? We were so fond of that book that we cried over it like\nMagdalens under the _line-trees_ last summer, and then it is an improving work that might edify your\nyoung lady.\"\n\"We are forbidden to go to the play,\" answered Victorine.\n\"Just look, those two yonder have dropped off where they sit,\" said Vautrin, shaking the heads of\nthe two sleepers in a comical way.\nHe altered the sleeping student's position, settled his head more comfortably on the back of his\nchair, kissed him warmly on the forehead, and began to sing:\n\"Sleep, little darlings;\nI watch while you slumber.\"\n\"I am afraid he may be ill,\" said Victorine.\n\"Then stop and take care of him,\" returned Vautrin. \"'Tis your duty as a meek and obedient wife,\"\nhe whispered in her ear. \"The young fellow worships you, and you will be his little wife--there's your\nfortune for you. In short,\" he added aloud, \"they lived happily ever afterwards, were much looked up to in\nall the countryside, and had a numerous family. That is how all the romances end.--Now, mamma,\" he\nwent on, as he turned to Madame Vauquer and put his arm round her waist, \"put on your bonnet, your\nbest flowered silk, and the countess' scarf, while I go out and call a cab--all my own self.\"\nAnd he started out, singing as he went:\n\"Oh! sun! divine sun! Ripening the pumpkins every one.\"\n\"My goodness! Well, I'm sure! Mme. Couture, I could live happily in a garret with a man like\nthat.--There, now!\" she added, looking round for the old vermicelli maker, \"there is that Father Goriot\nhalf seas over. _He_ never thought of taking me anywhere, the old skinflint. But he will measure his\nlength somewhere. My word! it is disgraceful to lose his senses like that, at his age! You will be telling\nme that he couldn't lose what he hadn't got--Sylvie, just take him up to his room!\"\nSylvie took him by the arm, supported him upstairs, and flung him just as he was, like a package,\nacross the bed.\n\"Poor young fellow!\" said Mme. Couture, putting back Eugene's hair that had fallen over his\neyes; \"he is like a young girl, he does not know what dissipation is.\"\n\n\"Well, I can tell you this, I know,\" said Mme. Vauquer, \"I have taken lodgers these thirty years,\nand a good many have passed through my hands, as the saying is, but I have never seen a nicer nor a more\naristocratic looking young man than M. Eugene. How handsome he looks sleeping! Just let his head rest\non your shoulder, Mme. Couture. Pshaw! he falls over towards Mlle. Victorine. There's a special\nprovidence for young things. A little more, and he would have broken his head against the knob of the\nchair. They'd make a pretty pair those two would!\"\n\"Hush, my good neighbor,\" cried Mme. Couture, \"you are saying such things----\"\n\"Pooh!\" put in Mme. Vauquer, \"he does not hear.--Here, Sylvie! come and help me to dress. I\nshall put on my best stays.\"\n\"What! your best stays just after dinner, madame?\" said Sylvie. \"No, you can get some one else to\nlace you. I am not going to be your murderer. It's a rash thing to do, and might cost you your life.\"\n\"I don't care, I must do honor to M. Vautrin.\"\n\"Are you so fond of your heirs as all that?\"\n\"Come, Sylvie, don't argue,\" said the widow, as she left the room.\n\"At her age, too!\" said the cook to Victorine, pointing to her mistress as she spoke.\nMme. Couture and her ward were left in the dining-room, and Eugene slept on Victorine's\nshoulder. The sound of Christophe's snoring echoed through the silent house; Eugene's quiet breathing\nseemed all the quieter by force of contrast, he was sleeping as peacefully as a child. Victorine was very\nhappy; she was free to perform one of those acts of charity which form an innocent outlet for all the\noverflowing sentiments of a woman's nature; he was so close to her that she could feel the throbbing of\nhis heart; there was a look of almost maternal protection and conscious pride in Victorine's face. Among\nthe countless thoughts that crowded up in her young innocent heart, there was a wild flutter of joy at this\nclose contact.\n\"Poor, dear child!\" said Mme. Couture, squeezing her hand.\nThe old lady looked at the girl. Victorine's innocent, pathetic face, so radiant with the new\nhappiness that had befallen her, called to mind some naive work of mediaeval art, when the painter\nneglected the accessories, reserving all the magic of his brush for the quiet, austere outlines and ivory\ntints of the face, which seems to have caught something of the golden glory of heaven.\n\"After all, he only took two glasses, mamma,\" said Victorine, passing her fingers through\nEugene's hair.\n\"Indeed, if he had been a dissipated young man, child, he would have carried his wine like the\nrest of them. His drowsiness does him credit.\"\nThere was a sound of wheels outside in the street.\n\"There is M. Vautrin, mamma,\" said the girl. \"Just take M. Eugene. I would rather not have that\nman see me like this; there are some ways of looking at you that seem to sully your soul and make you\n\nfeel as though you had nothing on.\"\n\"Oh, no, you are wrong!\" said Mme. Couture. \"M. Vautrin is a worthy man; he reminds me a\nlittle of my late husband, poor dear M. Couture, rough but kind-hearted; his bark is worse than his bite.\"\nVautrin came in while she was speaking; he did not make a sound, but looked for a while at the\npicture of the two young faces--the lamplight falling full upon them seemed to caress them.\n\"Well,\" he remarked, folding his arms, \"here is a picture! It would have suggested some pleasing\npages to Bernardin de Saint-Pierre (good soul), who wrote _Paul et Virginie_. Youth is very charming,\nMme. Couture!--Sleep on, poor boy,\" he added, looking at Eugene, \"luck sometimes comes while you are\nsleeping.--There is something touching and attractive to me about this young man, madame,\" he\ncontinued; \"I know that his nature is in harmony with his face. Just look, the head of a cherub on an\nangel's shoulder! He deserves to be loved. If I were a woman, I would die (no--not such a fool), I would\nlive for him.\" He bent lower and spoke in the widow's ear. \"When I see those two together, madame, I\ncannot help thinking that Providence meant them for each other; He works by secret ways, and tries the\nreins and the heart,\" he said in a loud voice. \"And when I see you, my children, thus united by a like\npurity and by all human affections, I say to myself that it is quite impossible that the future should\nseparate you. God is just.\"--He turned to Victorine. \"It seems to me,\" he said, \"that I have seen the line of\nsuccess in your hand. Let me look at it, Mlle. Victorine; I am well up in palmistry, and I have told\nfortunes many a time. Come, now, don't be frightened. Ah! what do I see? Upon my word, you will be\none of the richest heiresses in Paris before very long. You will heap riches on the man who loves you.\nYour father will want you to go and live with him. You will marry a young and handsome man with a\ntitle, and he will idolize you.\"\nThe heavy footsteps of the coquettish widow, who was coming down the stairs, interrupted\nVautrin's fortune-telling. \"Here is Mamma Vauquerre, fair as a starr-r-r, dressed within an inch of her life.\n--Aren't we a trifle pinched for room?\" he inquired, with his arm round the lady; \"we are screwed up very\ntightly about the bust, mamma! If we are much agitated, there may be an explosion; but I will pick up the\nfragments with all the care of an antiquary.\"\n\"There is a man who can talk the language of French gallantry!\" said the widow, bending to speak\nin Mme. Couture's ear.\n\"Good-bye, little ones!\" said Vautrin, turning to Eugene and Victorine. \"Bless you both!\" and he\nlaid a hand on either head. \"Take my word for it, young lady, an honest man's prayers are worth\nsomething; they should bring you happiness, for God hears them.\"\n\"Good-bye, dear,\" said Mme. Vauquer to her lodger. \"Do you think that M. Vautrin means to run\naway with me?\" she added, lowering her voice.\n\"Lack-a-day!\" said the widow.\n\"Oh! mamma dear, suppose it should really happen as that kind M. Vautrin said!\" said Victorine\nwith a sigh as she looked at her hands. The two women were alone together.\n\"Why, it wouldn't take much to bring it to pass,\" said the elderly lady; \"just a fall from his horse,\nand your monster of a brother----\"\n\n\"Oh! mamma.\"\n\"Good Lord! Well, perhaps it is a sin to wish bad luck to an enemy,\" the widow remarked. \"I will\ndo penance for it. Still, I would strew flowers on his grave with the greatest pleasure, and that is the truth.\nBlack-hearted, that he is! The coward couldn't speak up for his own mother, and cheats you out of your\nshare by deceit and trickery. My cousin had a pretty fortune of her own, but unluckily for you, nothing\nwas said in the marriage-contract about anything that she might come in for.\"\n\"It would be very hard if my fortune is to cost some one else his life,\" said Victorine. \"If I cannot\nbe happy unless my brother is to be taken out of the world, I would rather stay here all my life.\"\n\"_Mon Dieu!_ it is just as that good M. Vautrin says, and he is full of piety, you see,\" Mme.\nCouture remarked. \"I am very glad to find that he is not an unbeliever like the rest of them that talk of the\nAlmighty with less respect than they do of the Devil. Well, as he was saying, who can know the ways by\nwhich it may please Providence to lead us?\"\nWith Sylvie's help the two women at last succeeded in getting Eugene up to his room; they laid\nhim on the bed, and the cook unfastened his clothes to make him more comfortable. Before they left the\nroom, Victorine snatched an opportunity when her guardian's back was turned, and pressed a kiss on\nEugene's forehead, feeling all the joy that this stolen pleasure could give her. Then she looked round the\nroom, and gathering up, as it were, into one single thought all the untold bliss of that day, she made a\npicture of her memories, and dwelt upon it until she slept, the happiest creature in Paris.\nThat evening's merry-making, in the course of which Vautrin had given the drugged wine to\nEugene and Father Goriot, was his own ruin. Bianchon, flustered with wine, forgot to open the subject of\nTrompe-la-Mort with Mlle. Michonneau. The mere mention of the name would have set Vautrin on his\nguard; for Vautrin, or, to give him his real name, Jacques Collin, was in fact the notorious escaped\nconvict.\nBut it was the joke about the Venus of Pere-Lachaise that finally decided his fate. Mlle.\nMichonneau had very nearly made up her mind to warn the convict and to throw herself on his\ngenerosity, with the idea of making a better bargain for herself by helping him to escape that night; but as\nit was, she went out escorted by Poiret in search of the famous chief of detectives in the Petite Rue\nSaint-Anne, still thinking that it was the district superintendent--one Gondureau--with whom she had to\ndo. The head of the department received his visitors courteously. There was a little talk, and the details\nwere definitely arranged. Mlle. Michonneau asked for the draught that she was to administer in order to\nset about her investigation. But the great man's evident satisfaction set Mlle. Michonneau thinking; and\nshe began to see that this business involved something more than the mere capture of a runaway convict.\nShe racked her brains while he looked in a drawer in his desk for the little phial, and it dawned upon her\nthat in consequence of treacherous revelations made by the prisoners the police were hoping to lay their\nhands on a considerable sum of money. But on hinting her suspicions to the old fox of the Petite Rue\nSaint-Anne, that officer began to smile, and tried to put her off the scent.\n\"A delusion,\" he said. \"Collin's _sorbonne_ is the most dangerous that has yet been found among\nthe dangerous classes. That is all, and the rascals are quite aware of it. They rally round him; he is the\nbackbone of the federation, its Bonaparte, in short; he is very popular with them all. The rogue will never\nleave his _chump_ in the Place de Greve.\"\nAs Mlle. Michonneau seemed mystified, Gondureau explained the two slang words for her\n\nbenefit. _Sorbonne_ and _chump_ are two forcible expressions borrowed from thieves' Latin, thieves, of\nall people, being compelled to consider the human head in its two aspects. A sorbonne is the head of a\nliving man, his faculty of thinking--his council; a chump is a contemptuous epithet that implies how little\na human head is worth after the axe has done its work.\n\"Collin is playing us off,\" he continued. \"When we come across a man like a bar of steel\ntempered in the English fashion, there is always one resource left--we can kill him if he takes it into his\nhead to make the least resistance. We are reckoning on several methods of killing Collin to-morrow\nmorning. It saves a trial, and society is rid of him without all the expense of guarding and feeding him.\nWhat with getting up the case, summoning witnesses, paying their expenses, and carrying out the\nsentence, it costs a lot to go through all the proper formalities before you can get quit of one of these\ngood-for-nothings, over and above the three thousand francs that you are going to have. There is a saving\nin time as well. One good thrust of the bayonet into Trompe-la-Mort's paunch will prevent scores of\ncrimes, and save fifty scoundrels from following his example; they will be very careful to keep\nthemselves out of the police courts. That is doing the work of the police thoroughly, and true\nphilanthropists will tell you that it is better to prevent crime than to punish it.\"\n\"And you do a service to our country,\" said Poiret.\n\"Really, you are talking in a very sensible manner tonight, that you are,\" said the head of the\ndepartment. \"Yes, of course, we are serving our country, and we are very hardly used too. We do society\nvery great services that are not recognized. In fact, a superior man must rise above vulgar prejudices, and\na Christian must resign himself to the mishaps that doing right entails, when right is done in an\nout-of-the-way style. Paris is Paris, you see! That is the explanation of my life.--I have the honor to wish\nyou a good-evening, mademoiselle. I shall bring my men to the Jardin du Roi in the morning. Send\nChristophe to the Rue du Buffon, tell him to ask for M. Gondureau in the house where you saw me\nbefore.--Your servant, sir. If you should ever have anything stolen from you, come to me, and I will do\nmy best to get it back for you.\"\n\"Well, now,\" Poiret remarked to Mlle. Michonneau, \"there are idiots who are scared out of their\nwits by the word police. That was a very pleasant-spoken gentleman, and what he wants you to do is as\neasy as saying 'Good-day.'\"\nThe next day was destined to be one of the most extraordinary in the annals of the Maison\nVauquer. Hitherto the most startling occurrence in its tranquil existence had been the portentous,\nmeteor-like apparition of the sham Comtesse de l'Ambermesnil. But the catastrophes of this great day\nwere to cast all previous events into the shade, and supply an inexhaustible topic of conversation for\nMme. Vauquer and her boarders so long as she lived.\nIn the first place, Goriot and Eugene de Rastignac both slept till close upon eleven o'clock. Mme.\nVauquer, who came home about midnight from the Gaite, lay a-bed till half-past ten. Christophe, after a\nprolonged slumber (he had finished Vautrin's first bottle of wine), was behindhand with his work, but\nPoiret and Mlle. Michonneau uttered no complaint, though breakfast was delayed. As for Victorine and\nMme. Couture, they also lay late. Vautrin went out before eight o'clock, and only came back just as\nbreakfast was ready. Nobody protested, therefore, when Sylvie and Christophe went up at a quarter past\neleven, knocked at all the doors, and announced that breakfast was waiting. While Sylvie and the man\nwere upstairs, Mlle. Michonneau, who came down first, poured the contents of the phial into the silver\n\ncup belonging to Vautrin--it was standing with the others in the bain-marie that kept the cream hot for the\nmorning coffee. The spinster had reckoned on this custom of the house to do her stroke of business. The\nseven lodgers were at last collected together, not without some difficulty. Just as Eugene came\ndownstairs, stretching himself and yawning, a commissionaire handed him a letter from Mme. de\nNucingen. It ran thus:--\n\"I feel neither false vanity nor anger where you are concerned, my friend. Till two o'clock this\nmorning I waited for you. Oh, that waiting for one whom you love! No one that had passed through that\ntorture could inflict it on another. I know now that you have never loved before. What can have\nhappened? Anxiety has taken hold of me. I would have come myself to find out what had happened, if I\nhad not feared to betray the secrets of my heart. How can I walk out or drive out at this time of day?\nWould it not be ruin? I have felt to the full how wretched it is to be a woman. Send a word to reassure me,\nand explain how it is that you have not come after what my father told you. I shall be angry, but I will\nforgive you. One word, for pity's sake. You will come to me soon, will you not? If you are busy, a line\nwill be enough. Say, 'I will hasten to you,' or else, 'I am ill.' But if you were ill my father would have\ncome to tell me so. What can have happened? . . .\"\n\"Yes, indeed, what has happened?\" exclaimed Eugene, and, hurrying down to the dining-room,\nhe crumpled up the letter without reading any more. \"What time is it?\"\n\"Half-past eleven,\" said Vautrin, dropping a lump of sugar into his coffee.\nThe escaped convict cast a glance at Eugene, a cold and fascinating glance; men gifted with this\nmagnetic power can quell furious lunatics in a madhouse by such a glance, it is said. Eugene shook in\nevery limb. There was the sound of wheels in the street, and in another moment a man with a scared face\nrushed into the room. It was one of M. Taillefer's servants; Mme. Couture recognized the livery at once.\n\"Mademoiselle,\" he cried, \"your father is asking for you--something terrible has happened! M.\nFrederic has had a sword thrust in the forehead in a duel, and the doctors have given him up. You will\nscarcely be in time to say good-bye to him! he is unconscious.\"\n\"Poor young fellow!\" exclaimed Vautrin. \"How can people brawl when they have a certain\nincome of thirty thousand livres? Young people have bad manners, and that is a fact.\"\n\"Sir!\" cried Eugene.\n\"Well, what then, you big baby!\" said Vautrin, swallowing down his coffee imperturbably, an\noperation which Mlle. Michonneau watched with such close attention that she had no emotion to spare for\nthe amazing news that had struck the others dumb with amazement. \"Are there not duels every morning in\nParis?\" added Vautrin.\n\"I will go with you, Victorine,\" said Mme. Couture, and the two women hurried away at once\nwithout either hats or shawls. But before she went, Victorine, with her eyes full of tears, gave Eugene a\nglance that said--\"How little I thought that our happiness should cost me tears!\"\n\"Dear me, you are a prophet, M. Vautrin,\" said Mme. Vauquer.\n\"I am all sorts of things,\" said Vautrin.\n\n\"Queer, isn't it?\" said Mme. Vauquer, stringing together a succession of commonplaces suited to\nthe occasion. \"Death takes us off without asking us about it. The young often go before the old. It is a\nlucky thing for us women that we are not liable to fight duels, but we have other complaints that men\ndon't suffer from. We bear children, and it takes a long time to get over it. What a windfall for Victorine!\nHer father will have to acknowledge her now!\"\n\"There!\" said Vautrin, looking at Eugene, \"yesterday she had not a penny; this morning she has\nseveral millions to her fortune.\"\n\"I say, M. Eugene!\" cried Mme. Vauquer, \"you have landed on your feet!\"\nAt this exclamation, Father Goriot looked at the student, and saw the crumpled letter still in his\nhand.\n\"You have not read it through! What does this mean? Are you going to be like the rest of them?\"\nhe asked.\n\"Madame, I shall never marry Mlle. Victorine,\" said Eugene, turning to Mme. Vauquer with an\nexpression of terror and loathing that surprised the onlookers at this scene.\nFather Goriot caught the student's hand and grasped it warmly. He could have kissed it.\n\"Oh, ho!\" said Vautrin, \"the Italians have a good proverb--_Col tempo_.\"\n\"Is there any answer?\" said Mme. de Nucingen's messenger, addressing Eugene.\n\"Say that I will come directly.\"\nThe man went. Eugene was in a state of such violent excitement that he could not be prudent.\n\"What is to be done?\" he exclaimed aloud. \"There are no proofs!\"\nVautrin began to smile. Though the drug he had taken was doing its work, the convict was so\nvigorous that he rose to his feet, gave Rastignac a look, and said in hollow tones, \"Luck comes to us while\nwe sleep, young man,\" and fell stiff and stark, as if he were struck dead.\n\"So there is a Divine Justice!\" said Eugene.\n\"Well, if ever! What has come to that poor dear M. Vautrin?\"\n\"A stroke!\" cried Mlle. Michonneau.\n\"Here, Sylvie! girl, run for the doctor,\" called the widow. \"Oh, M. Rastignac, just go for M.\nBianchon, and be as quick as you can; Sylvie might not be in time to catch our doctor, M. Grimprel.\"\nRastignac was glad of an excuse to leave that den of horrors, his hurry for the doctor was nothing\nbut a flight.\n\"Here, Christophe, go round to the chemist's and ask for something that's good for the apoplexy.\"\n\nChristophe likewise went.\n\"Father Goriot, just help us to get him upstairs.\"\nVautrin was taken up among them, carried carefully up the narrow staircase, and laid upon his\nbed.\n\"I can do no good here, so I shall go to see my daughter,\" said M. Goriot.\n\"Selfish old thing!\" cried Mme. Vauquer. \"Yes, go; I wish you may die like a dog.\"\n\"Just go and see if you can find some ether,\" said Mlle. Michonneau to Mme. Vauquer; the\nformer, with some help from Poiret, had unfastened the sick man's clothes.\nMme. Vauquer went down to her room, and left Mlle. Michonneau mistress of the situation.\n\"Now! just pull down his shirt and turn him over, quick! You might be of some use in sparing my\nmodesty,\" she said to Poiret, \"instead of standing there like a stock.\"\nVautrin was turned over; Mlle. Michonneau gave his shoulder a sharp slap, and the two\nportentous letters appeared, white against the red.\n\"There, you have earned your three thousand francs very easily,\" exclaimed Poiret, supporting\nVautrin while Mlle. Michonneau slipped on the shirt again.--\"Ouf! How heavy he is,\" he added, as he laid\nthe convict down.\n\"Hush! Suppose there is a strong-box here!\" said the old maid briskly; her glances seemed to\npierce the walls, she scrutinized every article of the furniture with greedy eyes. \"Could we find some\nexcuse for opening that desk?\"\n\"It mightn't be quite right,\" responded Poiret to this.\n\"Where is the harm? It is money stolen from all sorts of people, so it doesn't belong to any one\nnow. But we haven't time, there is the Vauquer.\"\n\"Here is the ether,\" said that lady. \"I must say that this is an eventful day. Lord! that man can't\nhave had a stroke; he is as white as curds.\"\n\"White as curds?\" echoed Poiret.\n\"And his pulse is steady,\" said the widow, laying her hand on his breast.\n\"Steady?\" said the astonished Poiret.\n\"He is all right.\"\n\"Do you think so?\" asked Poiret.\n\"Lord! Yes, he looks as if he were sleeping. Sylvie has gone for a doctor. I say, Mlle.\n\nMichonneau, he is sniffing the ether. Pooh! it is only a spasm. His pulse is good. He is as strong as a\nTurk. Just look, mademoiselle, what a fur tippet he has on his chest; that is the sort of man to live till he is\na hundred. His wig holds on tightly, however. Dear me! it is glued on, and his own hair is red; that is why\nhe wears a wig. They say that red-haired people are either the worst or the best. Is he one of the good\nones, I wonder?\"\n\"Good to hang,\" said Poiret.\n\"Round a pretty woman's neck, you mean,\" said Mlle Michonneau, hastily. \"Just go away, M.\nPoiret. It is a woman's duty to nurse you men when you are ill. Besides, for all the good you are doing,\nyou may as well take yourself off,\" she added. \"Mme. Vauquer and I will take great care of dear M.\nVautrin.\nPoiret went out on tiptoe without a murmur, like a dog kicked out of the room by his master.\nRastignac had gone out for the sake of physical exertion; he wanted to breathe the air, he felt\nstifled. Yesterday evening he had meant to prevent the murder arranged for half-past eight that morning.\nWhat had happened? What ought he to do now? He trembled to think that he himself might be implicated.\nVautrin's coolness still further dismayed him.\n\"Yet, how if Vautrin should die without saying a word?\" Rastignac asked himself.\nHe hurried along the alleys of the Luxembourg Gardens as if the hounds of justice were after him,\nand he already heard the baying of the pack.\n\"Well?\" shouted Bianchon, \"you have seen the _Pilote_?\"\nThe _Pilote_ was a Radical sheet, edited by M. Tissot. It came out several hours later than the\nmorning papers, and was meant for the benefit of country subscribers; for it brought the morning news\ninto provincial districts twenty-four hours sooner than the ordinary local journals.\n\"There is a wonderful history in it,\" said the house student of the Hopital Cochin. \"Young\nTaillefer called out Count Franchessini, of the Old Guard, and the Count put a couple of inches of steel\ninto his forehead. And here is little Victorine one of the richest heiresses in Paris! If we had known that,\neh? What a game of chance death is! They say Victorine was sweet on you; was there any truth in it?\"\n\"Shut up, Bianchon; I shall never marry her. I am in love with a charming woman, and she is in\nlove with me, so----\"\n\"You said that as if you were screwing yourself up to be faithful to her. I should like to see the\nwoman worth the sacrifice of Master Taillefer's money!\"\n\"Are all the devils of hell at my heels?\" cried Rastignac.\n\"What is the matter with you? Are you mad? Give us your hand,\" said Bianchon, \"and let me feel\nyour pulse. You are feverish.\"\n\"Just go to Mother Vauquer's,\" said Rastignac; \"that scoundrel Vautrin has dropped down like\none dead.\"\n\n\"Aha!\" said Bianchon, leaving Rastignac to his reflections, \"you confirm my suspicions, and now\nI mean to make sure for myself.\"\nThe law student's long walk was a memorable one for him. He made in some sort a survey of his\nconscience. After a close scrutiny, after hesitation and self-examination, his honor at any rate came out\nscatheless from this sharp and terrible ordeal, like a bar of iron tested in the English fashion. He\nremembered Father Goriot's confidences of the evening before; he recollected the rooms taken for him in\nthe Rue d'Artois, so that he might be near Delphine; and then he thought of his letter, and read it again\nand kissed it.\n\"Such a love is my anchor of safety,\" he said to himself. \"How the old man's heart must have\nbeen wrung! He says nothing about all that he has been through; but who could not guess? Well, then, I\nwill be like a son to him; his life shall be made happy. If she cares for me, she will often come to spend\nthe day with him. That grand Comtesse de Restaud is a heartless thing; she would make her father into her\nhall porter. Dear Delphine! she is kinder to the old man; she is worthy to be loved. Ah! this evening I\nshall be very happy!\"\nHe took out his watch and admired it.\n\"I have had nothing but success! If two people mean to love each other for ever, they may help\neach other, and I can take this. Besides, I shall succeed, and I will pay her a hundredfold. There is nothing\ncriminal in this _liaison_; nothing that could cause the most austere moralist to frown. How many\nrespectable people contract similar unions! We deceive nobody; it is deception that makes a position\nhumiliating. If you lie, you lower yourself at once. She and her husband have lived apart for a long while.\nBesides, how if I called upon that Alsatian to resign a wife whom he cannot make happy?\"\nRastignac's battle with himself went on for a long while; and though the scruples of youth\ninevitably gained the day, an irresistible curiosity led him, about half-past four, to return to the Maison\nVauquer through the gathering dusk.\nBianchon had given Vautrin an emetic, reserving the contents of the stomach for chemical\nanalysis at the hospital. Mlle. Michonneau's officious alacrity had still further strengthened his suspicions\nof her. Vautrin, moreover, had recovered so quickly that it was impossible not to suspect some plot\nagainst the leader of all frolics at the lodging-house. Vautrin was standing in front of the stove in the\ndining-room when Rastignac came in. All the lodgers were assembled sooner than usual by the news of\nyoung Taillefer's duel. They were anxious to hear any detail about the affair, and to talk over the probable\nchange in Victorine's prospects. Father Goriot alone was absent, but the rest were chatting. No sooner did\nEugene come into the room, than his eyes met the inscrutable gaze of Vautrin. It was the same look that\nhad read his thoughts before--the look that had such power to waken evil thoughts in his heart. He\nshuddered.\n\"Well, dear boy,\" said the escaped convict, \"I am likely to cheat death for a good while yet.\nAccording to these ladies, I have had a stroke that would have felled an ox, and come off with flying\ncolors.\"\n\"A bull you might say,\" cried the widow.\n\"You really might be sorry to see me still alive,\" said Vautrin in Rastignac's ear, thinking that he\nguessed the student's thoughts. \"You must be mighty sure of yourself.\"\n\n\"Mlle. Michonneau was talking the day before yesterday about a gentleman named\n_Trompe-la-Mort_,\" said Bianchon; \"and, upon my word, that name would do very well for you.\"\nVautrin seemed thunderstruck. He turned pale, and staggered back. He turned his magnetic\nglance, like a ray of vivid light, on Mlle. Michonneau; the old maid shrank and trembled under the\ninfluence of that strong will, and collapsed into a chair. The mask of good-nature had dropped from the\nconvict's face; from the unmistakable ferocity of that sinister look, Poiret felt that the old maid was in\ndanger, and hastily stepped between them. None of the lodgers understood this scene in the least, they\nlooked on in mute amazement. There was a pause. Just then there was a sound of tramping feet outside;\nthere were soldiers there, it seemed, for there was a ring of several rifles on the pavement of the street.\nCollin was mechanically looking round the walls for a way of escape, when four men entered by way of\nthe sitting-room.\n\"In the name of the King and the Law!\" said an officer, but the words were almost lost in a\nmurmur of astonishment.\nSilence fell on the room. The lodgers made way for three of the men, who had each a hand on a\ncocked pistol in a side pocket. Two policemen, who followed the detectives, kept the entrance to the\nsitting-room, and two more men appeared in the doorway that gave access to the staircase. A sound of\nfootsteps came from the garden, and again the rifles of several soldiers rang on the cobblestones under the\nwindow. All chance of salvation by flight was cut off for Trompe-la-Mort, to whom all eyes instinctively\nturned. The chief walked straight up to him, and commenced operations by giving him a sharp blow on\nthe head, so that the wig fell off, and Collin's face was revealed in all its ugliness. There was a terrible\nsuggestion of strength mingled with cunning in the short, brick-red crop of hair, the whole head was in\nharmony with his powerful frame, and at that moment the fires of hell seemed to gleam from his eyes. In\nthat flash the real Vautrin shone forth, revealed at once before them all; they understood his past, his\npresent, and future, his pitiless doctrines, his actions, the religion of his own good pleasure, the majesty\nwith which his cynicism and contempt for mankind invested him, the physical strength of an organization\nproof against all trials. The blood flew to his face, and his eyes glared like the eyes of a wild cat. He\nstarted back with savage energy and a fierce growl that drew exclamations of alarm from the lodgers. At\nthat leonine start the police caught at their pistols under cover of the general clamor. Collin saw the\ngleaming muzzles of the weapons, saw his danger, and instantly gave proof of a power of the highest\norder. There was something horrible and majestic in the spectacle of the sudden transformation in his\nface; he could only be compared to a cauldron full of the steam that can send mountains flying, a terrific\nforce dispelled in a moment by a drop of cold water. The drop of water that cooled his wrathful fury was\na reflection that flashed across his brain like lightning. He began to smile, and looked down at his wig.\n\"You are not in the politest of humors to-day,\" he remarked to the chief, and he held out his hands\nto the policemen with a jerk of his head.\n\"Gentlemen,\" he said, \"put on the bracelets or the handcuffs. I call on those present to witness that\nI make no resistance.\"\nA murmur of admiration ran through the room at the sudden outpouring like fire and lava flood\nfrom this human volcano, and its equally sudden cessation.\n\"There's a sell for you, master crusher,\" the convict added, looking at the famous director of\npolice.\n\n\"Come, strip!\" said he of the Petite Rue Saint-Anne, contemptuously.\n\"Why?\" asked Collin. \"There are ladies present; I deny nothing, and surrender.\"\nHe paused, and looked round the room like an orator who is about to overwhelm his audience.\n\"Take this down, Daddy Lachapelle,\" he went on, addressing a little, white-haired old man who\nhad seated himself at the end of the table; and after drawing a printed form from the portfolio, was\nproceeding to draw up a document. \"I acknowledge myself to be Jacques Collin, otherwise known as\nTrompe-la-Mort, condemned to twenty years' penal servitude, and I have just proved that I have come\nfairly by my nickname.--If I had as much as raised my hand,\" he went on, addressing the other lodgers,\n\"those three sneaking wretches yonder would have drawn claret on Mamma Vauquer's domestic hearth.\nThe rogues have laid their heads together to set a trap for me.\"\nMme. Vauquer felt sick and faint at these words.\n\"Good Lord!\" she cried, \"this does give one a turn; and me at the Gaite with him only last night!\"\nshe said to Sylvie.\n\"Summon your philosophy, mamma,\" Collin resumed. \"Is it a misfortune to have sat in my box at\nthe Gaite yesterday evening? After all, are you better than we are? The brand upon our shoulders is less\nshameful than the brand set on your hearts, you flabby members of a society rotten to the core. Not the\nbest man among you could stand up to me.\" His eyes rested upon Rastignac, to whom he spoke with a\npleasant smile that seemed strangely at variance with the savage expression in his eyes.--\"Our little\nbargain still holds good, dear boy; you can accept any time you like! Do you understand?\" And he sang:\n\"A charming girl is my Fanchette\nIn her simplicity.\"\n\"Don't you trouble yourself,\" he went on; \"I can get in my money. They are too much afraid of\nme to swindle me.\"\nThe convicts' prison, its language and customs, its sudden sharp transitions from the humorous to\nthe horrible, its appalling grandeur, its triviality and its dark depths, were all revealed in turn by the\nspeaker's discourse; he seemed to be no longer a man, but the type and mouthpiece of a degenerate race, a\nbrutal, supple, clear-headed race of savages. In one moment Collin became the poet of an inferno,\nwherein all thoughts and passions that move human nature (save repentance) find a place. He looked\nabout him like a fallen archangel who is for war to the end. Rastignac lowered his eyes, and\nacknowledged this kinship claimed by crime as an expiation of his own evil thoughts.\n\"Who betrayed me?\" said Collin, and his terrible eyes traveled round the room. Suddenly they\nrested on Mlle. Michonneau.\n\"It was you, old cat!\" he said. \"That sham stroke of apoplexy was your doing, lynx eyes! . . . Two\nwords from me, and your throat would be cut in less than a week, but I forgive you, I am a Christian. You\ndid not sell me either. But who did?----Aha! you may rummage upstairs,\" he shouted, hearing the police\nofficers opening his cupboards and taking possession of his effects. \"The nest is empty, the birds flew\naway yesterday, and you will be none the wiser. My ledgers are here,\" he said tapping his forehead. \"Now\nI know who sold me! It could only be that blackguard Fil-de-Soie. That is who it was, old catchpoll, eh?\"\nhe said, turning to the chief. \"It was timed so neatly to get the banknotes up above there. There is nothing\n\nleft for you--spies! As for Fil-de-Soie, he will be under the daisies in less than a fortnight, even if you\nwere to tell off the whole force to protect him. How much did you give the Michonnette?\" he asked of the\npolice officers. \"A thousand crowns? Oh you Ninon in decay, Pompadour in tatters, Venus of the\ngraveyard, I was worth more than that! If you had given me warning, you should have had six thousand\nfrancs. Ah! you had no suspicion of that, old trafficker in flesh and blood, or I should have had the\npreference. Yes, I would have given six thousand francs to save myself an inconvenient journey and some\nloss of money,\" he said, as they fastened the handcuffs on his wrists. \"These folks will amuse themselves\nby dragging out this business till the end of time to keep me idle. If they were to send me straight to jail, I\nshould soon be back at my old tricks in spite of the duffers at the Quai des Orfevres. Down yonder they\nwill all turn themselves inside out to help their general--their good Trompe-la-Mort--to get clear away. Is\nthere a single one among you that can say, as I can, that he has ten thousand brothers ready to do anything\nfor him?\" he asked proudly. \"There is some good there,\" he said tapping his heart; \"I have never betrayed\nany one!--Look you here, you slut,\" he said to the old maid, \"they are all afraid of me, do you see? but the\nsight of you turns them sick. Rake in your gains.\"\nHe was silent for a moment, and looked round at the lodgers' faces.\n\"What dolts you are, all of you! Have you never seen a convict before? A convict of Collin's\nstamp, whom you see before you, is a man less weak-kneed than others; he lifts up his voice against the\ncolossal fraud of the Social Contract, as Jean Jacques did, whose pupil he is proud to declare himself. In\nshort, I stand here single-handed against a Government and a whole subsidized machinery of tribunals\nand police, and I am a match for them all.\"\n\"Ye gods!\" cried the painter, \"what a magnificent sketch one might make of him!\"\n\"Look here, you gentlemen-in-waiting to his highness the gibbet, master of ceremonies to the\nwidow\" (a nickname full of sombre poetry, given by prisoners to the guillotine), \"be a good fellow, and\ntell me if it really was Fil-de-Soie who sold me. I don't want him to suffer for some one else, that would\nnot be fair.\"\nBut before the chief had time to answer, the rest of the party returned from making their\ninvestigations upstairs. Everything had been opened and inventoried. A few words passed between them\nand the chief, and the official preliminaries were complete.\n\"Gentlemen,\" said Collin, addressing the lodgers, \"they will take me away directly. You have all\nmade my stay among you very agreeable, and I shall look back upon it with gratitude. Receive my adieux,\nand permit me to send you figs from Provence.\"\nHe advanced a step or two, and then turned to look once more at Rastignac.\n\"Good-bye, Eugene,\" he said, in a sad and gentle tone, a strange transition from his previous\nrough and stern manner. \"If you should be hard up, I have left you a devoted friend,\" and, in spite of his\nshackles, he managed to assume a posture of defence, called, \"One, two!\" like a fencing-master, and\nlunged. \"If anything goes wrong, apply in that quarter. Man and money, all at your service.\"\nThe strange speaker's manner was sufficiently burlesque, so that no one but Rastignac knew that\nthere was a serious meaning underlying the pantomime.\nAs soon as the police, soldiers, and detectives had left the house, Sylvie, who was rubbing her\n\nmistress' temples with vinegar, looked round at the bewildered lodgers.\n\"Well,\" said she, \"he was a man, he was, for all that.\"\nHer words broke the spell. Every one had been too much excited, too much moved by very\nvarious feelings to speak. But now the lodgers began to look at each other, and then all eyes were turned\nat once on Mlle. Michonneau, a thin, shriveled, dead-alive, mummy-like figure, crouching by the stove;\nher eyes were downcast, as if she feared that the green eye-shade could not shut out the expression of\nthose faces from her. This figure and the feeling of repulsion she had so long excited were explained all at\nonce. A smothered murmur filled the room; it was so unanimous, that it seemed as if the same feeling of\nloathing had pitched all the voices in one key. Mlle. Michonneau heard it, and did not stir. It was\nBianchon who was the first to move; he bent over his neighbor, and said in a low voice, \"If that creature\nis going to stop here, and have dinner with us, I shall clear out.\"\nIn the twinkling of an eye it was clear that every one in the room, save Poiret, was of the medical\nstudent's opinion, so that the latter, strong in the support of the majority, went up to that elderly person.\n\"You are more intimate with Mlle. Michonneau than the rest of us,\" he said; \"speak to her, make\nher understand that she must go, and go at once.\"\n\"At once!\" echoed Poiret in amazement.\nThen he went across to the crouching figure, and spoke a few words in her ear.\n\"I have paid beforehand for the quarter; I have as much right to be here as any one else,\" she said,\nwith a viperous look at the boarders.\n\"Never mind that! we will club together and pay you the money back,\" said Rastignac.\n\"Monsieur is taking Collin's part\" she said, with a questioning, malignant glance at the law\nstudent; \"it is not difficult to guess why.\"\nEugene started forward at the words, as if he meant to spring upon her and wring her neck. That\nglance, and the depths of treachery that it revealed, had been a hideous enlightenment.\n\"Let her alone!\" cried the boarders.\nRastignac folded his arms and was silent.\n\"Let us have no more of Mlle. Judas,\" said the painter, turning to Mme. Vauquer. \"If you don't\nshow the Michonneau the door, madame, we shall all leave your shop, and wherever we go we shall say\nthat there are only convicts and spies left there. If you do the other thing, we will hold our tongues about\nthe business; for when all is said and done, it might happen in the best society until they brand them on\nthe forehead, when they send them to the hulks. They ought not to let convicts go about Paris disguised\nlike decent citizens, so as to carry on their antics like a set of rascally humbugs, which they are.\"\nAt this Mme. Vauquer recovered miraculously. She sat up and folded her arms; her eyes were\nwide open now, and there was no sign of tears in them.\n\n\"Why, do you really mean to be the ruin of my establishment, my dear sir? There is M.\nVautrin----Goodness,\" she cried, interrupting herself, \"I can't help calling him by the name he passed\nhimself off by for an honest man! There is one room to let already, and you want me to turn out two more\nlodgers in the middle of the season, when no one is moving----\"\n\"Gentlemen, let us take our hats and go and dine at Flicoteaux's in the Place Sorbonne,\" cried\nBianchon.\nMme. Vauquer glanced round, and saw in a moment on which side her interest lay. She waddled\nacross to Mlle. Michonneau.\n\"Come, now,\" she said; \"you would not be the ruin of my establishment, would you, eh? There's a\ndear, kind soul. You see what a pass these gentlemen have brought me to; just go up to your room for this\nevening.\"\n\"Never a bit of it!\" cried the boarders. \"She must go, and go this minute!\"\n\"But the poor lady has had no dinner,\" said Poiret, with piteous entreaty.\n\"She can go and dine where she likes,\" shouted several voices.\n\"Turn her out, the spy!\"\n\"Turn them both out! Spies!\"\n\"Gentlemen,\" cried Poiret, his heart swelling with the courage that love gives to the ovine male,\n\"respect the weaker sex.\"\n\"Spies are of no sex!\" said the painter.\n\"A precious sexorama!\"\n\"Turn her into the streetorama!\"\n\"Gentlemen, this is not manners! If you turn people out of the house, it ought not to be done so\nunceremoniously and with no notice at all. We have paid our money, and we are not going,\" said Poiret,\nputting on his cap, and taking a chair beside Mlle. Michonneau, with whom Mme. Vauquer was\nremonstrating.\n\"Naughty boy!\" said the painter, with a comical look; \"run away, naughty little boy!\"\n\"Look here,\" said Bianchon; \"if you do not go, all the rest of us will,\" and the boarders, to a man,\nmade for the sitting-room-door.\n\"Oh! mademoiselle, what is to be done?\" cried Mme. Vauquer. \"I am a ruined woman. You can't\nstay here; they will go further, do something violent.\"\nMlle. Michonneau rose to her feet.\n\n\"She is going!--She is not going!--She is going!--No, she isn't.\"\nThese alternate exclamations, and a suggestion of hostile intentions, borne out by the behavior of\nthe insurgents, compelled Mlle. Michonneau to take her departure. She made some stipulations, speaking\nin a low voice in her hostess' ear, and then--\"I shall go to Mme. Buneaud's,\" she said, with a threatening\nlook.\n\"Go where you please, mademoiselle,\" said Mme. Vauquer, who regarded this choice of an\nopposition establishment as an atrocious insult. \"Go and lodge with the Buneaud; the wine would give a\ncat the colic, and the food is cheap and nasty.\"\nThe boarders stood aside in two rows to let her pass; not a word was spoken. Poiret looked so\nwistfully after Mlle. Michonneau, and so artlessly revealed that he was in two minds whether to go or\nstay, that the boarders, in their joy at being quit of Mlle. Michonneau, burst out laughing at the sight of\nhim.\n\"Hist!--st!--st! Poiret,\" shouted the painter. \"Hallo! I say, Poiret, hallo!\" The _employe_ from the\nMuseum began to sing:\n\"Partant pour la Syrie,\nLe jeune et beau Dunois . . .\"\n\"Get along with you; you must be dying to go, _trahit sua quemque voluptas!_\" said Bianchon.\n\"Every one to his taste--free rendering from Virgil,\" said the tutor.\nMlle. Michonneau made a movement as if to take Poiret's arm, with an appealing glance that he\ncould not resist. The two went out together, the old maid leaning upon him, and there was a burst of\napplause, followed by peals of laughter.\n\"Bravo, Poiret!\"\n\"Who would have thought it of old Poiret!\"\n\"Apollo Poiret!\"\n\"Mars Poiret!\"\n\"Intrepid Poiret!\"\nA messenger came in at that moment with a letter for Mme. Vauquer, who read it through, and\ncollapsed in her chair.\n\"The house might as well be burned down at once,\" cried she, \"if there are to be any more of\nthese thunderbolts! Young Taillefer died at three o'clock this afternoon. It serves me right for wishing\nwell to those ladies at that poor man's expense. Mme. Couture and Victorine want me to send their things,\nbecause they are going to live with her father. M. Taillefer allows his daughter to keep old Mme. Couture\nas her lady companion. Four rooms to let! and five lodgers gone! . . .\"\nShe sat up, and seemed about to burst into tears.\n\n\"Bad luck has come to lodge here, I think,\" she cried.\nOnce more there came a sound of wheels from the street outside.\n\"What! another windfall for somebody!\" was Sylvie's comment.\nBut it was Goriot who came in, looking so radiant, so flushed with happiness, that he seemed to\nhave grown young again.\n\"Goriot in a cab!\" cried the boarders; \"the world is coming to an end.\"\nThe good soul made straight for Eugene, who was standing wrapped in thought in a corner, and\nlaid a hand on the young man's arm.\n\"Come,\" he said, with gladness in his eyes.\n\"Then you haven't heard the news?\" said Eugene. \"Vautrin was an escaped convict; they have just\narrested him; and young Taillefer is dead.\"\n\"Very well, but what business is it of ours?\" replied Father Goriot. \"I am going to dine with my\ndaughter in _your house_, do you understand? She is expecting you. Come!\"\nHe carried off Rastignac with him by main force, and they departed in as great a hurry as a pair of\neloping lovers.\n\"Now, let us have dinner,\" cried the painter, and every one drew his chair to the table.\n\"Well, I never,\" said the portly Sylvie. \"Nothing goes right to-day! The haricot mutton has\ncaught! Bah! you will have to eat it, burned as it is, more's the pity!\"\nMme. Vauquer was so dispirited that she could not say a word as she looked round the table and\nsaw only ten people where eighteen should be; but every one tried to comfort and cheer her. At first the\ndinner contingent, as was natural, talked about Vautrin and the day's events; but the conversation wound\nround to such topics of interest as duels, jails, justice, prison life, and alterations that ought to be made in\nthe laws. They soon wandered miles away from Jacques Collin and Victorine and her brother. There\nmight be only ten of them, but they made noise enough for twenty; indeed, there seemed to be more of\nthem than usual; that was the only difference between yesterday and to-day. Indifference to the fate of\nothers is a matter of course in this selfish world, which, on the morrow of tragedy, seeks among the events\nof Paris for a fresh sensation for its daily renewed appetite, and this indifference soon gained the upper\nhand. Mme. Vauquer herself grew calmer under the soothing influence of hope, and the mouthpiece of\nhope was the portly Sylvie.\nThat day had gone by like a dream for Eugene, and the sense of unreality lasted into the evening;\nso that, in spite of his energetic character and clear-headedness, his ideas were a chaos as he sat beside\nGoriot in the cab. The old man's voice was full of unwonted happiness, but Eugene had been shaken by so\nmany emotions that the words sounded in his ears like words spoken in a dream.\n\"It was finished this morning! All three of us are going to dine there together, together! Do you\nunderstand? I have not dined with my Delphine, my little Delphine, these four years, and I shall have her\n\nfor a whole evening! We have been at your lodging the whole time since morning. I have been working\nlike a porter in my shirt sleeves, helping to carry in the furniture. Aha! you don't know what pretty ways\nshe has; at table she will look after me, 'Here, papa, just try this, it is nice.' And I shall not be able to eat.\nOh, it is a long while since I have been with her in quiet every-day life as we shall have her.\"\n\"It really seems as if the world has been turned upside down.\"\n\"Upside down?\" repeated Father Goriot. \"Why, the world has never been so right-side up. I see\nnone but smiling faces in the streets, people who shake hands cordially and embrace each other, people\nwho all look as happy as if they were going to dine with their daughter, and gobble down a nice little\ndinner that she went with me to order of the chef at the Cafe des Anglais. But, pshaw! with her beside you\ngall and wormwood would be as sweet as honey.\"\n\"I feel as if I were coming back to life again,\" said Eugene.\n\"Why, hurry up there!\" cried Father Goriot, letting down the window in front. \"Get on faster; I\nwill give you five francs if you get to the place I told you of in ten minutes time.\"\nWith this prospect before him the cabman crossed Paris with miraculous celerity.\n\"How that fellow crawls!\" said Father Goriot.\n\"But where are you taking me?\" Eugene asked him.\n\"To your own house,\" said Goriot.\nThe cab stopped in the Rue d'Artois. Father Goriot stepped out first and flung ten francs to the\nman with the recklessness of a widower returning to bachelor ways.\n\"Come along upstairs,\" he said to Rastignac. They crossed a courtyard, and climbed up to the\nthird floor of a new and handsome house. There they stopped before a door; but before Goriot could ring,\nit was opened by Therese, Mme. de Nucingen's maid. Eugene found himself in a charming set of\nchambers; an ante-room, a little drawing-room, a bedroom, and a study, looking out upon a garden. The\nfurniture and the decorations of the little drawing-room were of the most daintily charming description,\nthe room was full of soft light, and Delphine rose up from a low chair by the fire and stood before him.\nShe set her fire-screen down on the chimney-piece, and spoke with tenderness in every tone of her voice.\n\"So we had to go in search of you, sir, you who are so slow to understand!\"\nTherese left the room. The student took Delphine in his arms and held her in a tight clasp, his\neyes filled with tears of joy. This last contrast between his present surroundings and the scenes he had just\nwitnessed was too much for Rastignac's over-wrought nerves, after the day's strain and excitement that\nhad wearied heart and brain; he was almost overcome by it.\n\"I felt sure myself that he loved you,\" murmured Father Goriot, while Eugene lay back\nbewildered on the sofa, utterly unable to speak a word or to reason out how and why the magic wand had\nbeen waved to bring about this final transformation scene.\n\"But you must see your rooms,\" said Mme. de Nucingen. She took his hand and led him into a\n\nroom carpeted and furnished like her own; indeed, down to the smallest details, it was a reproduction in\nminiature of Delphine's apartment.\n\"There is no bed,\" said Rastignac.\n\"No, monsieur,\" she answered, reddening, and pressing his hand. Eugene, looking at her,\nunderstood, young though he yet was, how deeply modesty is implanted in the heart of a woman who\nloves.\n\"You are one of those beings whom we cannot choose but to adore for ever,\" he said in her ear.\n\"Yes, the deeper and truer love is, the more mysterious and closely veiled it should be; I can dare to say\nso, since we understand each other so well. No one shall learn our secret.\"\n\"Oh! so I am nobody, I suppose,\" growled the father.\n\"You know quite well that 'we' means you.\"\n\"Ah! that is what I wanted. You will not mind me, will you? I shall go and come like a good fairy\nwho makes himself felt everywhere without being seen, shall I not? Eh, Delphinette, Ninette, Dedel--was\nit not a good idea of mine to say to you, 'There are some nice rooms to let in the Rue d'Artois; let us\nfurnish them for him?' And she would not hear of it! Ah! your happiness has been all my doing. I am the\nauthor of your happiness and of your existence. Fathers must always be giving if they would be happy\nthemselves; always giving--they would not be fathers else.\"\n\"Was that how it happened?\" asked Eugene.\n\"Yes. She would not listen to me. She was afraid that people would talk, as if the rubbish that\nthey say about you were to be compared with happiness! Why, all women dream of doing what she has\ndone----\"\nFather Goriot found himself without an audience, for Mme. de Nucingen had led Rastignac into\nthe study; he heard a kiss given and taken, low though the sound was.\nThe study was furnished as elegantly as the other rooms, and nothing was wanting there.\n\"Have we guessed your wishes rightly?\" she asked, as they returned to the drawing-room for\ndinner.\n\"Yes,\" he said, \"only too well, alas! For all this luxury so well carried out, this realization of\npleasant dreams, the elegance that satisfies all the romantic fancies of youth, appeals to me so strongly\nthat I cannot but feel that it is my rightful possession, but I cannot accept it from you, and I am too poor\nas yet to----\"\n\"Ah! ah! you say me nay already,\" she said with arch imperiousness, and a charming little pout of\nthe lips, a woman's way of laughing away scruples.\nBut Eugene had submitted so lately to that solemn self-questioning, and Vautrin's arrest had so\nplainly shown him the depths of the pit that lay ready to his feet, that the instincts of generosity and honor\nhad been strengthened in him, and he could not allow himself to be coaxed into abandoning his\n\nhigh-minded determinations. Profound melancholy filled his mind.\n\"Do you really mean to refuse?\" said Mme. de Nucingen. \"And do you know what such a refusal\nmeans? That you are not sure of yourself, that you do not dare to bind yourself to me. Are you really\nafraid of betraying my affection? If you love me, if I--love you, why should you shrink back from such a\nslight obligation? If you but knew what a pleasure it has been to see after all the arrangements of this\nbachelor establishment, you would not hesitate any longer, you would ask me to forgive you for your\nhesitation. I had some money that belonged to you, and I have made good use of it, that is all. You mean\nthis for magnanimity, but it is very little of you. You are asking me for far more than this. . . . Ah!\" she\ncried, as Eugene's passionate glance was turned on her, \"and you are making difficulties about the merest\ntrifles. Of, if you feel no love whatever for me, refuse, by all means. My fate hangs on a word from you.\nSpeak!--Father,\" she said after a pause, \"make him listen to reason. Can he imagine that I am less nice\nthan he is on the point of honor?\"\nFather Goriot was looking on and listening to this pretty quarrel with a placid smile, as if he had\nfound some balm for all the sorrows of life.\n\"Child that you are!\" she cried again, catching Eugene's hand. \"You are just beginning life; you\nfind barriers at the outset that many a man finds insurmountable; a woman's hand opens the way and you\nshrink back! Why, you are sure to succeed! You will have a brilliant future. Success is written on that\nbroad forehead of yours, and will you not be able to repay me my loan of to-day? Did not a lady in olden\ntimes arm her knight with sword and helmet and coat of mail, and find him a charger, so that he might\nfight for her in the tournament? Well, then, Eugene, these things that I offer you are the weapons of this\nage; every one who means to be something must have such tools as these. A pretty place your garret must\nbe if it is like papa's room! See, dinner is waiting all this time. Do you want to make me unhappy?--Why\ndon't you answer?\" she said, shaking his hand. \"_Mon Dieu!_ papa, make up his mind for him, or I will\ngo away and never see him any more.\"\n\"I will make up your mind,\" said Goriot, coming down from the clouds. \"Now, my dear M.\nEugene, the next thing is to borrow money of the Jews, isn't it?\"\n\"There is positively no help for it,\" said Eugene.\n\"All right, I will give you credit,\" said the other, drawing out a cheap leather pocket-book, much\nthe worse for wear. \"I have turned Jew myself; I paid for everything; here are the invoices. You do not\nowe a penny for anything here. It did not come to very much--five thousand francs at most, and I am\ngoing to lend you the money myself. I am not a woman--you can refuse me. You shall give me a receipt\non a scrap of paper, and you can return it some time or other.\"\nDelphine and Eugene looked at each other in amazement, tears sprang to their eyes. Rastignac\nheld out his hand and grasped Goriot's warmly.\n\"Well, what is all this about? Are you not my children?\"\n\"Oh! my poor father,\" said Mme. de Nucingen, \"how did you do it?\"\n\"Ah! now you ask me. When I made up my mind to move him nearer to you, and saw you buying\nthings as if they were wedding presents, I said to myself, 'She will never be able to pay for them.' The\nattorney says that those law proceedings will last quite six months before your husband can be made to\n\ndisgorge your fortune. Well and good. I sold out my property in the funds that brought in thirteen hundred\nand fifty livres a year, and bought a safe annuity of twelve hundred francs a year for fifteen thousand\nfrancs. Then I paid your tradesmen out of the rest of the capital. As for me, children, I have a room\nupstairs for which I pay fifty crowns a year; I can live like a prince on two francs a day, and still have\nsomething left over. I shall not have to spend anything much on clothes, for I never wear anything out.\nThis fortnight past I have been laughing in my sleeve, thinking to myself, 'How happy they are going to\nbe!' and--well, now, are you not happy?\"\n\"Oh papa! papa!\" cried Mme. de Nucingen, springing to her father, who took her on his knee. She\ncovered him with kisses, her fair hair brushed his cheek, her tears fell on the withered face that had grown\nso bright and radiant.\n\"Dear father, what a father you are! No, there is not another father like you under the sun. If\nEugene loved you before, what must he feel for you now?\"\n\"Why, children, why Delphinette!\" cried Goriot, who had not felt his daughter's heart beat against\nhis breast for ten years, \"do you want me to die of joy? My poor heart will break! Come, Monsieur\nEugene, we are quits already.\" And the old man strained her to his breast with such fierce and passionate\nforce that she cried out.\n\"Oh! you are hurting me!\" she said.\n\"I am hurting you!\" He grew pale at the words. The pain expressed in his face seemed greater\nthan it is given to humanity to know. The agony of this Christ of paternity can only be compared with the\nmasterpieces of those princes of the palette who have left for us the record of their visions of an agony\nsuffered for a whole world by the Saviour of men. Father Goriot pressed his lips very gently against the\nwaist than his fingers had grasped too roughly.\n\"Oh! no, no,\" he cried. \"I have not hurt you, have I?\" and his smile seemed to repeat the question.\n\"YOU have hurt me with that cry just now.--The things cost rather more than that,\" he said in her ear,\nwith another gentle kiss, \"but I had to deceive him about it, or he would have been angry.\"\nEugene sat dumb with amazement in the presence of this inexhaustible love; he gazed at Goriot,\nand his face betrayed the artless admiration which shapes the beliefs of youth.\n\"I will be worthy of all this,\" he cried.\n\"Oh! my Eugene, that is nobly said,\" and Mme. de Nucingen kissed the law student on the\nforehead.\n\"He gave up Mlle. Taillefer and her millions for you,\" said Father Goriot. \"Yes, the little thing\nwas in love with you, and now that her brother is dead she is as rich as Croesus.\"\n\"Oh! why did you tell her?\" cried Rastignac.\n\"Eugene,\" Delphine said in his ear, \"I have one regret now this evening. Ah! how I will love you!\nand for ever!\"\n\"This is the happiest day I have had since you two were married!\" cried Goriot. \"God may send\n\nme any suffering, so long as I do not suffer through you, and I can still say, 'In this short month of\nFebruary I had more happiness than other men have in their whole lives.'--Look at me, Fifine!\" he said to\nhis daughter. \"She is very beautiful, is she not? Tell me, now, have you seen many women with that\npretty soft color--that little dimple of hers? No, I thought not. Ah, well, and but for me this lovely woman\nwould never have been. And very soon happiness will make her a thousand times lovelier, happiness\nthrough you. I could give up my place in heaven to you, neighbor, if needs be, and go down to hell\ninstead. Come, let us have dinner,\" he added, scarcely knowing what he said, \"everything is ours.\"\n\"Poor dear father!\"\nHe rose and went over to her, and took her face in his hands, and set a kiss on the plaits of hair.\n\"If you only knew, little one, how happy you can make me--how little it takes to make me happy! Will\nyou come and see me sometimes? I shall be just above, so it is only a step. Promise me, say that you\nwill!\"\n\"Yes, dear father.\"\n\"Say it again.\"\n\"Yes, I will, my kind father.\"\n\"Hush! hush! I should make you say it a hundred times over if I followed my own wishes. Let us\nhave dinner.\"\nThe three behaved like children that evening, and Father Goriot's spirits were certainly not the\nleast wild. He lay at his daughter's feet, kissed them, gazed into her eyes, rubbed his head against her\ndress; in short, no young lover could have been more extravagant or more tender.\n\"You see!\" Delphine said with a look at Eugene, \"so long as my father is with us, he monopolizes\nme. He will be rather in the way sometimes.\"\nEugene had himself already felt certain twinges of jealousy, and could not blame this speech that\ncontained the germ of all ingratitude.\n\"And when will the rooms be ready?\" asked Eugene, looking round. \"We must all leave them this\nevening, I suppose.\"\n\"Yes, but to-morrow you must come and dine with me,\" she answered, with an eloquent glance.\n\"It is our night at the Italiens.\"\n\"I shall go to the pit,\" said her father.\nIt was midnight. Mme. de Nucingen's carriage was waiting for her, and Father Goriot and the\nstudent walked back to the Maison Vauquer, talking of Delphine, and warming over their talk till there\ngrew up a curious rivalry between the two violent passions. Eugene could not help seeing that the father's\nself-less love was deeper and more steadfast than his own. For this worshiper Delphine was always pure\nand fair, and her father's adoration drew its fervor from a whole past as well as a future of love.\nThey found Mme. Vauquer by the stove, with Sylvie and Christophe to keep her company; the\n\nold landlady, sitting like Marius among the ruins of Carthage, was waiting for the two lodgers that yet\nremained to her, and bemoaning her lot with the sympathetic Sylvie. Tasso's lamentations as recorded in\nByron's poem are undoubtedly eloquent, but for sheer force of truth they fall far short of the widow's cry\nfrom the depths.\n\"Only three cups of coffee in the morning, Sylvie! Oh dear! to have your house emptied in this\nway is enough to break your heart. What is life, now my lodgers are gone? Nothing at all. Just think of it!\nIt is just as if all the furniture had been taken out of the house, and your furniture is your life. How have I\noffended heaven to draw down all this trouble upon me? And haricot beans and potatoes laid in for\ntwenty people! The police in my house too! We shall have to live on potatoes now, and Christophe will\nhave to go!\"\nThe Savoyard, who was fast asleep, suddenly woke up at this, and said, \"Madame,\"\nquestioningly.\n\"Poor fellow!\" said Sylvie, \"he is like a dog.\"\n\"In the dead season, too! Nobody is moving now. I would like to know where the lodgers are to\ndrop down from. It drives me distracted. And that old witch of a Michonneau goes and takes Poiret with\nher! What can she have done to make him so fond of her? He runs about after her like a little dog.\"\n\"Lord!\" said Sylvie, flinging up her head, \"those old maids are up to all sorts of tricks.\"\n\"There's that poor M. Vautrin that they made out to be a convict,\" the widow went on. \"Well, you\nknow that is too much for me, Sylvie; I can't bring myself to believe it. Such a lively man as he was, and\npaid fifteen francs a month for his coffee of an evening, paid you very penny on the nail too.\"\n\"And open-handed he was!\" said Christophe.\n\"There is some mistake,\" said Sylvie.\n\"Why, no there isn't! he said so himself!\" said Mme. Vauquer. \"And to think that all these things\nhave happened in my house, and in a quarter where you never see a cat go by. On my word as an honest\nwoman, it's like a dream. For, look here, we saw Louis XVI. meet with his mishap; we saw the fall of the\nEmperor; and we saw him come back and fall again; there was nothing out of the way in all that, but\nlodging-houses are not liable to revolutions. You can do without a king, but you must eat all the same;\nand so long as a decent woman, a de Conflans born and bred, will give you all sorts of good things for\ndinner, nothing short of the end of the world ought to--but there, it is the end of the world, that is just\nwhat it is!\"\n\"And to think that Mlle. Michonneau who made all this mischief is to have a thousand crowns a\nyear for it, so I hear,\" cried Sylvie.\n\"Don't speak of her, she is a wicked woman!\" said Mme. Vauquer. \"She is going to the Buneaud,\nwho charges less than cost. But the Buneaud is capable of anything; she must have done frightful things,\nrobbed and murdered people in her time. _She_ ought to be put in jail for life instead of that poor\ndear----\"\nEugene and Goriot rang the door-bell at that moment.\n\n\"Ah! here are my two faithful lodgers,\" said the widow, sighing.\nBut the two faithful lodgers, who retained but shadowy recollections of the misfortunes of their\nlodging-house, announced to their hostess without more ado that they were about to remove to the\nChaussee d'Antin.\n\"Sylvie!\" cried the widow, \"this is the last straw.--Gentlemen, this will be the death of me! It has\nquite upset me! There's a weight on my chest! I am ten years older for this day! Upon my word, I shall go\nout of my senses! And what is to be done with the haricots!--Oh, well, if I am to be left here all by\nmyself, you shall go to-morrow, Christophe.--Good-night, gentlemen,\" and she went.\n\"What is the matter now?\" Eugene inquired of Sylvie.\n\"Lord! everybody is going about his business, and that has addled her wits. There! she is crying\nupstairs. It will do her good to snivel a bit. It's the first time she has cried since I've been with her.\"\nBy the morning, Mme. Vauquer, to use her own expression, had \"made up her mind to it.\" True,\nshe still wore a doleful countenance, as might be expected of a woman who had lost all her lodgers, and\nwhose manner of life had been suddenly revolutionized, but she had all her wits about her. Her grief was\ngenuine and profound; it was real pain of mind, for her purse had suffered, the routine of her existence\nhad been broken. A lover's farewell glance at his lady-love's window is not more mournful than Mme.\nVauquer's survey of the empty places round her table. Eugene administered comfort, telling the widow\nthat Bianchon, whose term of residence at the hospital was about to expire, would doubtless take his\n(Rastignac's) place; that the official from the Museum had often expressed a desire to have Mme.\nCouture's rooms; and that in a very few days her household would be on the old footing.\n\"God send it may, my dear sir! but bad luck has come to lodge here. There'll be a death in the\nhouse before ten days are out, you'll see,\" and she gave a lugubrious look round the dining-room. \"Whose\nturn will it be, I wonder?\"\n\"It is just as well that we are moving out,\" said Eugene to Father Goriot in a low voice.\n\"Madame,\" said Sylvie, running in with a scared face, \"I have not seen Mistigris these three\ndays.\"\n\"Ah! well, if my cat is dead, if _he_ has gone and left us, I----\"\nThe poor woman could not finish her sentence; she clasped her hands and hid her face on the\nback of her armchair, quite overcome by this dreadful portent.\nBy twelve o'clock, when the postman reaches that quarter, Eugene received a letter. The dainty\nenvelope bore the Beauseant arms on the seal, and contained an invitation to the Vicomtesse's great ball,\nwhich had been talked of in Paris for a month. A little note for Eugene was slipped in with the card.\n\"I think, monsieur, that you will undertake with pleasure to interpret my sentiments to Mme. de\nNucingen, so I am sending the card for which you asked me to you. I shall be delighted to make the\nacquaintance of Mme. de Restaud's sister. Pray introduce that charming lady to me, and do not let her\nmonopolize all your affection, for you owe me not a little in return for mine.\n\n\"VICOMTESSE DE BEAUSEANT.\"\n\"Well,\" said Eugene to himself, as he read the note a second time, \"Mme. de Beauseant says\npretty plainly that she does not want the Baron de Nucingen.\"\nHe went to Delphine at once in his joy. He had procured this pleasure for her, and doubtless he\nwould receive the price of it. Mme. de Nucingen was dressing. Rastignac waited in her boudoir, enduring\nas best he might the natural impatience of an eager temperament for the reward desired and withheld for a\nyear. Such sensations are only known once in a life. The first woman to whom a man is drawn, if she is\nreally a woman--that is to say, if she appears to him amid the splendid accessories that form a necessary\nbackground to life in the world of Paris--will never have a rival.\nLove in Paris is a thing distinct and apart; for in Paris neither men nor women are the dupes of the\ncommonplaces by which people seek to throw a veil over their motives, or to parade a fine affectation of\ndisinterestedness in their sentiments. In this country within a country, it is not merely required of a\nwoman that she should satisfy the senses and the soul; she knows perfectly well that she has still greater\nobligations to discharge, that she must fulfil the countless demands of a vanity that enters into every fibre\nof that living organism called society. Love, for her, is above all things, and by its very nature, a\nvainglorious, brazen-fronted, ostentatious, thriftless charlatan. If at the Court of Louis XIV. there was not\na woman but envied Mlle. de la Valliere the reckless devotion of passion that led the grand monarch to\ntear the priceless ruffles at his wrists in order to assist the entry of a Duc de Vermandois into the world\n--what can you expect of the rest of society? You must have youth and wealth and rank; nay, you must, if\npossible, have more than these, for the more incense you bring with you to burn at the shrine of the god,\nthe more favorably will he regard the worshiper. Love is a religion, and his cult must in the nature of\nthings be more costly than those of all other deities; Love the Spoiler stays for a moment, and then passes\non; like the urchin of the streets, his course may be traced by the ravages that he has made. The wealth of\nfeeling and imagination is the poetry of the garret; how should love exist there without that wealth?\nIf there are exceptions who do not subscribe to these Draconian laws of the Parisian code, they\nare solitary examples. Such souls live so far out of the main current that they are not borne away by the\ndoctrines of society; they dwell beside some clear spring of everflowing water, without seeking to leave\nthe green shade; happy to listen to the echoes of the infinite in everything around them and in their own\nsouls, waiting in patience to take their flight for heaven, while they look with pity upon those of earth.\nRastignac, like most young men who have been early impressed by the circumstances of power\nand grandeur, meant to enter the lists fully armed; the burning ambition of conquest possessed him\nalready; perhaps he was conscious of his powers, but as yet he knew neither the end to which his ambition\nwas to be directed, nor the means of attaining it. In default of the pure and sacred love that fills a life,\nambition may become something very noble, subduing to itself every thought of personal interest, and\nsetting as the end--the greatness, not of one man, but of a whole nation.\nBut the student had not yet reached the time of life when a man surveys the whole course of\nexistence and judges it soberly. Hitherto he had scarcely so much as shaken off the spell of the fresh and\ngracious influences that envelop a childhood in the country, like green leaves and grass. He had hesitated\non the brink of the Parisian Rubicon, and in spite of the prickings of ambition, he still clung to a lingering\ntradition of an old ideal--the peaceful life of the noble in his chateau. But yesterday evening, at the sight\nof his rooms, those scruples had vanished. He had learned what it was to enjoy the material advantages of\nfortune, as he had already enjoyed the social advantages of birth; he ceased to be a provincial from that\nmoment, and slipped naturally and easily into a position which opened up a prospect of a brilliant future.\n\nSo, as he waited for Delphine, in the pretty boudoir, where he felt that he had a certain right to be,\nhe felt himself so far away from the Rastignac who came back to Paris a year ago, that, turning some\npower of inner vision upon this latter, he asked himself whether that past self bore any resemblance to the\nRastignac of that moment.\n\"Madame is in her room,\" Therese came to tell him. The woman's voice made him start.\nHe found Delphine lying back in her low chair by the fireside, looking fresh and bright. The sight\nof her among the flowing draperies of muslin suggested some beautiful tropical flower, where the fruit is\nset amid the blossom.\n\"Well,\" she said, with a tremor in her voice, \"here you are.\"\n\"Guess what I bring for you,\" said Eugene, sitting down beside her. He took possession of her\narm to kiss her hand.\nMme. de Nucingen gave a joyful start as she saw the card. She turned to Eugene; there were tears\nin her eyes as she flung her arms about his neck, and drew him towards her in a frenzy of gratified vanity.\n\"And I owe this happiness to you--to _thee_\" (she whispered the more intimate word in his ear);\n\"but Therese is in my dressing-room, let us be prudent.--This happiness--yes, for I may call it so, when it\ncomes to me through _you_--is surely more than a triumph for self-love? No one has been willing to\nintroduce me into that set. Perhaps just now I may seem to you to be frivolous, petty, shallow, like a\nParisienne, but remember, my friend, that I am ready to give up all for you; and that if I long more than\never for an entrance into the Faubourg Saint-Germain, it is because I shall meet you there.\"\n\"Mme. de Beauseant's note seems to say very plainly that she does not expect to see the _Baron_\nde Nucingen at her ball; don't you think so?\" said Eugene.\n\"Why, yes,\" said the Baroness as she returned the letter. \"Those women have a talent for\ninsolence. But it is of no consequence, I shall go. My sister is sure to be there, and sure to be very\nbeautifully dressed.--Eugene,\" she went on, lowering her voice, \"she will go to dispel ugly suspicions.\nYou do not know the things that people are saying about her. Only this morning Nucingen came to tell me\nthat they had been discussing her at the club. Great heavens! on what does a woman's character and the\nhonor of a whole family depend! I feel that I am nearly touched and wounded in my poor sister.\nAccording to some people, M. de Trailles must have put his name to bills for a hundred thousand francs,\nnearly all of them are overdue, and proceedings are threatened. In this predicament, it seems that my sister\nsold her diamonds to a Jew--the beautiful diamonds that belonged to her husband's mother, Mme. de\nRestaud the elder,--you have seen her wearing them. In fact, nothing else has been talked about for the\nlast two days. So I can see that Anastasie is sure to come to Mme. de Beauseant's ball in tissue of gold,\nand ablaze with diamonds, to draw all eyes upon her; and I will not be outshone. She has tried to eclipse\nme all her life, she has never been kind to me, and I have helped her so often, and always had money for\nher when she had none. --But never mind other people now, to-day I mean to be perfectly happy.\"\nAt one o'clock that morning Eugene was still with Mme. de Nucingen. In the midst of their lovers'\nfarewell, a farewell full of hope of bliss to come, she said in a troubled voice, \"I am very fearful,\nsuperstitious. Give what name you like to my presentiments, but I am afraid that my happiness will be\npaid for by some horrible catastrophe.\"\n\n\"Child!\" said Eugene.\n\"Ah! have we changed places, and am I the child to-night?\" she asked, laughingly.\nEugene went back to the Maison Vauquer, never doubting but that he should leave it for good on\nthe morrow; and on the way he fell to dreaming the bright dreams of youth, when the cup of happiness\nhas left its sweetness on the lips.\n\"Well?\" cried Goriot, as Rastignac passed by his door.\n\"Yes,\" said Eugene; \"I will tell you everything to-morrow.\"\n\"Everything, will you not?\" cried the old man. \"Go to bed. To-morrow our happy life will begin.\"\nNext day, Goriot and Rastignac were ready to leave the lodging-house, and only awaited the good\npleasure of a porter to move out of it; but towards noon there was a sound of wheels in the Rue\nNeuve-Sainte-Genevieve, and a carriage stopped before the door of the Maison Vauquer. Mme. de\nNucingen alighted, and asked if her father was still in the house, and, receiving an affirmative reply from\nSylvie, ran lightly upstairs.\nIt so happened that Eugene was at home all unknown to his neighbor. At breakfast time he had\nasked Goriot to superintend the removal of his goods, saying that he would meet him in the Rue d'Artois\nat four o'clock; but Rastignac's name had been called early on the list at the Ecole de Droit, and he had\ngone back at once to the Rue Nueve-Sainte-Genevieve. No one had seen him come in, for Goriot had\ngone to find a porter, and the mistress of the house was likewise out. Eugene had thought to pay her\nhimself, for it struck him that if he left this, Goriot in his zeal would probably pay for him. As it was,\nEugene went up to his room to see that nothing had been forgotten, and blessed his foresight when he saw\nthe blank bill bearing Vautrin's signature lying in the drawer where he had carelessly thrown it on the day\nwhen he had repaid the amount. There was no fire in the grate, so he was about to tear it into little pieces,\nwhen he heard a voice speaking in Goriot's room, and the speaker was Delphine! He made no more noise,\nand stood still to listen, thinking that she should have no secrets from him; but after the first few words,\nthe conversation between the father and daughter was so strange and interesting that it absorbed all his\nattention.\n\"Ah! thank heaven that you thought of asking him to give an account of the money settled on me\nbefore I was utterly ruined, father. Is it safe to talk?\" she added.\n\"Yes, there is no one in the house,\" said her father faintly.\n\"What is the matter with you?\" asked Mme. de Nucingen.\n\"God forgive you! you have just dealt me a staggering blow, child!\" said the old man. \"You\ncannot know how much I love you, or you would not have burst in upon me like this, with such news,\nespecially if all is not lost. Has something so important happened that you must come here about it? In a\nfew minutes we should have been in the Rue d'Artois.\"\n\"Eh! does one think what one is doing after a catastrophe? It has turned my head. Your attorney\nhas found out the state of things now, but it was bound to come out sooner or later. We shall want your\nlong business experience; and I come to you like a drowning man who catches at a branch. When M.\n\nDerville found that Nucingen was throwing all sorts of difficulties in his way, he threatened him with\nproceedings, and told him plainly that he would soon obtain an order from the President of the Tribunal.\nSo Nucingen came to my room this morning, and asked if I meant to ruin us both. I told him that I knew\nnothing whatever about it, that I had a fortune, and ought to be put into possession of my fortune, and that\nmy attorney was acting for me in the matter; I said again that I knew absolutely nothing about it, and\ncould not possibly go into the subject with him. Wasn't that what you told me to tell him?\"\n\"Yes, quite right,\" answered Goriot.\n\"Well, then,\" Delphine continued, \"he told me all about his affairs. He had just invested all his\ncapital and mine in business speculations; they have only just been started, and very large sums of money\nare locked up. If I were to compel him to refund my dowry now, he would be forced to file his petition;\nbut if I will wait a year, he undertakes, on his honor, to double or treble my fortune, by investing it in\nbuilding land, and I shall be mistress at last of the whole of my property. He was speaking the truth, father\ndear; he frightened me! He asked my pardon for his conduct; he has given me my liberty; I am free to act\nas I please on condition that I leave him to carry on my business in my name. To prove his sincerity, he\npromised that M. Derville might inspect the accounts as often as I pleased, so that I might be assured that\neverything was being conducted properly. In short, he put himself in my power, bound hand and foot. He\nwishes the present arrangements as to the expenses of housekeeping to continue for two more years, and\nentreated me not to exceed my allowance. He showed me plainly that it was all that he could do to keep\nup appearances; he has broken with his opera dancer; he will be compelled to practise the most strict\neconomy (in secret) if he is to bide his time with unshaken credit. I scolded, I did all I could to drive him\nto desperation, so as to find out more. He showed me his ledgers--he broke down and cried at last. I never\nsaw a man in such a state. He lost his head completely, talked of killing himself, and raved till I felt quite\nsorry for him.\"\n\"Do you really believe that silly rubbish?\" . . . cried her father. \"It was all got up for your benefit!\nI have had to do with Germans in the way of business, honest and straightforward they are pretty sure to\nbe, but when with their simplicity and frankness they are sharpers and humbugs as well, they are the\nworst rogues of all. Your husband is taking advantage of you. As soon as pressure is brought to bear on\nhim he shams dead; he means to be more the master under your name than in his own. He will take\nadvantage of the position to secure himself against the risks of business. He is as sharp as he is\ntreacherous; he is a bad lot! No, no; I am not going to leave my girls behind me without a penny when I\ngo to Pere-Lachaise. I know something about business still. He has sunk his money in speculation, he\nsays; very well then, there is something to show for it--bills, receipts, papers of some sort. Let him\nproduce them, and come to an arrangement with you. We will choose the most promising of his\nspeculations, take them over at our own risk, and have the securities transferred into your name; they shall\nrepresent the separate estate of Delphine Goriot, wife of the Baron de Nucingen. Does that fellow really\ntake us for idiots? Does he imagine that I could stand the idea of your being without fortune, without\nbread, for forty-eight hours? I would not stand it a day--no, not a night, not a couple of hours! If there had\nbeen any foundation for the idea, I should never get over it. What! I have worked hard for forty years,\ncarried sacks on my back, and sweated and pinched and saved all my life for you, my darlings, for you\nwho made the toil and every burden borne for you seem light; and now, my fortune, my whole life, is to\nvanish in smoke! I should die raving mad if I believed a word of it. By all that's holiest in heaven and\nearth, we will have this cleared up at once; go through the books, have the whole business looked\nthoroughly into! I will not sleep, nor rest, nor eat until I have satisfied myself that all your fortune is in\nexistence. Your money is settled upon you, God be thanked! and, luckily, your attorney, Maitre Derville,\nis an honest man. Good Lord! you shall have your snug little million, your fifty thousand francs a year, as\nlong as you live, or I will raise a racket in Paris, I will so! If the Tribunals put upon us, I will appeal to the\n\nChambers. If I knew that you were well and comfortably off as far as money is concerned, that thought\nwould keep me easy in spite of bad health and troubles. Money? why, it is life! Money does everything.\nThat great dolt of an Alsatian shall sing to another tune! Look here, Delphine, don't give way, don't make\na concession of half a quarter of a farthing to that fathead, who has ground you down and made you\nmiserable. If he can't do without you, we will give him a good cudgeling, and keep him in order. Great\nheavens! my brain is on fire; it is as if there were something redhot inside my head. My Delphine lying on\nstraw! You! my Fifine! Good gracious! Where are my gloves? Come, let us go at once; I mean to see\neverything with my own eyes --books, cash, and correspondence, the whole business. I shall have no\npeace until I know for certain that your fortune is secure.\"\n\"Oh! father dear, be careful how you set about it! If there is the least hint of vengeance in the\nbusiness, if you show yourself openly hostile, it will be all over with me. He knows whom he has to deal\nwith; he thinks it quite natural that if you put the idea into my head, I should be uneasy about my money;\nbut I swear to you that he has it in his own hands, and that he had meant to keep it. He is just the man to\nabscond with all the money and leave us in the lurch, the scoundrel! He knows quite well that I will not\ndishonor the name I bear by bringing him into a court of law. His position is strong and weak at the same\ntime. If we drive him to despair, I am lost.\"\n\"Why, then, the man is a rogue?\"\n\"Well, yes, father,\" she said, flinging herself into a chair, \"I wanted to keep it from you to spare\nyour feelings,\" and she burst into tears; \"I did not want you to know that you had married me to such a\nman as he is. He is just the same in private life--body and soul and conscience--the same through and\nthrough--hideous! I hate him; I despise him! Yes, after all that that despicable Nucingen has told me, I\ncannot respect him any longer. A man capable of mixing himself up in such affairs, and of talking about\nthem to me as he did, without the slightest scruple,--it is because I have read him through and through that\nI am afraid of him. He, my husband, frankly proposed to give me my liberty, and do you know what that\nmeans? It means that if things turn out badly for him, I am to play into his hands, and be his\nstalking-horse.\"\n\"But there is law to be had! There is a Place de Greve for sons-in-law of that sort,\" cried her\nfather; \"why, I would guillotine him myself if there was no headsman to do it.\"\n\"No, father, the law cannot touch him. Listen, this is what he says, stripped of all his\ncircumlocutions--'Take your choice, you and no one else can be my accomplice; either everything is lost,\nyou are ruined and have not a farthing, or you will let me carry this business through myself.' Is that plain\nspeaking? He _must_ have my assistance. He is assured that his wife will deal fairly by him; he knows\nthat I shall leave his money to him and be content with my own. It is an unholy and dishonest compact,\nand he holds out threats of ruin to compel me to consent to it. He is buying my conscience, and the price\nis liberty to be Eugene's wife in all but name. 'I connive at your errors, and you allow me to commit\ncrimes and ruin poor families!' Is that sufficiently explicit? Do you know what he means by speculations?\nHe buys up land in his own name, then he finds men of straw to run up houses upon it. These men make a\nbargain with a contractor to build the houses, paying them by bills at long dates; then in consideration of a\nsmall sum they leave my husband in possession of the houses, and finally slip through the fingers of the\ndeluded contractors by going into bankruptcy. The name of the firm of Nucingen has been used to dazzle\nthe poor contractors. I saw that. I noticed, too, that Nucingen had sent bills for large amounts to\nAmsterdam, London, Naples, and Vienna, in order to prove if necessary that large sums had been paid\naway by the firm. How could we get possession of those bills?\"\n\nEugene heard a dull thud on the floor; Father Goriot must have fallen on his knees.\n\"Great heavens! what have I done to you? Bound my daughter to this scoundrel who does as he\nlikes with her!--Oh! my child, my child! forgive me!\" cried the old man.\n\"Yes, if I am in the depths of despair, perhaps you are to blame,\" said Delphine. \"We have so\nlittle sense when we marry! What do we know of the world, of business, or men, or life? Our fathers\nshould think for us! Father dear, I am not blaming you in the least, forgive me for what I said. This is all\nmy own fault. Nay, do not cry, papa,\" she said, kissing him.\n\"Do not cry either, my little Delphine. Look up and let me kiss away the tears. There! I shall find\nmy wits and unravel this skein of your husband's winding.\"\n\"No, let me do that; I shall be able to manage him. He is fond of me, well and good; I shall use\nmy influence to make him invest my money as soon as possible in landed property in my own name. Very\nlikely I could get him to buy back Nucingen in Alsace in my name; that has always been a pet idea of his.\nStill, come to-morrow and go through the books, and look into the business. M. Derville knows little of\nmercantile matters. No, not to-morrow though. I do not want to be upset. Mme. de Beauseant's ball will\nbe the day after to-morrow, and I must keep quiet, so as to look my best and freshest, and do honor to my\ndear Eugene! . . . Come, let us see his room.\"\nBut as she spoke a carriage stopped in the Rue Nueve-Sainte-Genevieve, and the sound of Mme.\nde Restaud's voice came from the staircase. \"Is my father in?\" she asked of Sylvie.\nThis accident was luckily timed for Eugene, whose one idea had been to throw himself down on\nthe bed and pretend to be asleep.\n\"Oh, father, have you heard about Anastasie?\" said Delphine, when she heard her sister speak. \"It\nlooks as though some strange things had happened in that family.\"\n\"What sort of things?\" asked Goriot. \"This is like to be the death of me. My poor head will not\nstand a double misfortune.\"\n\"Good-morning, father,\" said the Countess from the threshold. \"Oh! Delphine, are you here?\"\nMme. de Restaud seemed taken aback by her sister's presence.\n\"Good-morning, Nasie,\" said the Baroness. \"What is there so extraordinary in my being here? _I_\nsee our father every day.\"\n\"Since when?\"\n\"If you came yourself you would know.\"\n\"Don't tease, Delphine,\" said the Countess fretfully. \"I am very miserable, I am lost. Oh! my poor\nfather, it is hopeless this time!\"\n\"What is it, Nasie?\" cried Goriot. \"Tell us all about it, child! How white she is! Quick, do\nsomething, Delphine; be kind to her, and I will love you even better, if that were possible.\"\n\n\"Poor Nasie!\" said Mme. de Nucingen, drawing her sister to a chair. \"We are the only two people\nin the world whose love is always sufficient to forgive you everything. Family affection is the surest, you\nsee.\"\nThe Countess inhaled the salts and revived.\n\"This will kill me!\" said their father. \"There,\" he went on, stirring the smouldering fire, \"come\nnearer, both of you. It is cold. What is it, Nasie? Be quick and tell me, this is enough to----\"\n\"Well, then, my husband knows everything,\" said the Countess. \"Just imagine it; do you\nremember, father, that bill of Maxime's some time ago? Well, that was not the first. I had paid ever so\nmany before that. About the beginning of January M. de Trailles seemed very much troubled. He said\nnothing to me; but it is so easy to read the hearts of those you love, a mere trifle is enough; and then you\nfeel things instinctively. Indeed, he was more tender and affectionate than ever, and I was happier than I\nhad ever been before. Poor Maxime! in himself he was really saying good-bye to me, so he has told me\nsince; he meant to blow his brains out! At last I worried him so, and begged and implored so hard; for two\nhours I knelt at his knees and prayed and entreated, and at last he told me--that he owed a hundred\nthousand francs. Oh! papa! a hundred thousand francs! I was beside myself! You had not the money, I\nknew, I had eaten up all that you had----\"\n\"No,\" said Goriot; \"I could not have got it for you unless I had stolen it. But I would have done\nthat for you, Nasie! I will do it yet.\"\nThe words came from him like a sob, a hoarse sound like the death rattle of a dying man; it\nseemed indeed like the agony of death when the father's love was powerless. There was a pause, and\nneither of the sisters spoke. It must have been selfishness indeed that could hear unmoved that cry of\nanguish that, like a pebble thrown over a precipice, revealed the depths of his despair.\n\"I found the money, father, by selling what was not mine to sell,\" and the Countess burst into\ntears.\nDelphine was touched; she laid her head on her sister's shoulder, and cried too.\n\"Then it is all true,\" she said.\nAnastasie bowed her head, Mme. de Nucingen flung her arms about her, kissed her tenderly, and\nheld her sister to her heart.\n\"I shall always love you and never judge you, Nasie,\" she said.\n\"My angels,\" murmured Goriot faintly. \"Oh, why should it be trouble that draws you together?\"\nThis warm and palpitating affection seemed to give the Countess courage.\n\"To save Maxime's life,\" she said, \"to save all my own happiness, I went to the money-lender you\nknow of, a man of iron forged in hell-fire; nothing can melt him; I took all the family diamonds that M. de\nRestaud is so proud of--his and mine too--and sold them to that M. Gobseck. _Sold them!_ Do you\nunderstand? I saved Maxime, but I am lost. Restaud found it all out.\"\n\n\"How? Who told him? I will kill him,\" cried Goriot.\n\"Yesterday he sent to tell me to come to his room. I went. . . . 'Anastasie,' he said in a voice--oh!\nsuch a voice; that was enough, it told me everything--'where are your diamonds?'--'In my room----'--'No,'\nhe said, looking straight at me, 'there they are on that chest of drawers----' and he lifted his handkerchief\nand showed me the casket. 'Do you know where they came from?' he said. I fell at his feet. . . . I cried; I\nbesought him to tell me the death he wished to see me die.\"\n\"You said that!\" cried Goriot. \"By God in heaven, whoever lays a hand on either of you so long\nas I am alive may reckon on being roasted by slow fires! Yes, I will cut him in pieces like . . .\"\nGoriot stopped; the words died away in his throat.\n\"And then, dear, he asked something worse than death of me. Oh! heaven preserve all other\nwomen from hearing such words as I heard then!\"\n\"I will murder that man,\" said Goriot quietly. \"But he has only one life, and he deserves to die\ntwice.--And then, what next?\" he added, looking at Anastasie.\n\"Then,\" the Countess resumed, \"there was a pause, and he looked at me. 'Anastasie,' he said, 'I\nwill bury this in silence; there shall be no separation; there are the children. I will not kill M. de Trailles. I\nmight miss him if we fought, and as for other ways of getting rid of him, I should come into collision with\nthe law. If I killed him in your arms, it would bring dishonor on _those_ children. But if you do not want\nto see your children perish, nor their father nor me, you must first of all submit to two conditions. Answer\nme. Have I a child of my own?' I answered, 'Yes,'--'Which?'--'Ernest, our eldest boy.' --'Very well,' he\nsaid, 'and now swear to obey me in this particular from this time forward.' I swore. 'You will make over\nyour property to me when I require you to do so.'\"\n\"Do nothing of the kind!\" cried Goriot. \"Aha! M. de Restaud, you could not make your wife\nhappy; she has looked for happiness and found it elsewhere, and you make her suffer for your own\nineptitude? He will have to reckon with me. Make yourself easy, Nasie. Aha! he cares about his heir!\nGood, very good. I will get hold of the boy; isn't he my grandson? What the blazes! I can surely go to see\nthe brat! I will stow him away somewhere; I will take care of him, you may be quite easy. I will bring\nRestaud to terms, the monster! I shall say to him, 'A word or two with you! If you want your son back\nagain, give my daughter her property, and leave her to do as she pleases.'\"\n\"Father!\"\n\"Yes. I am your father, Nasie, a father indeed! That rogue of a great lord had better not ill-treat\nmy daughter. _Tonnerre!_ What is it in my veins? There is the blood of a tiger in me; I could tear those\ntwo men to pieces! Oh! children, children! so this is what your lives are! Why, it is death! . . . What will\nbecome of you when I shall be here no longer? Fathers ought to live as long as their children. Ah! Lord\nGod in heaven! how ill Thy world is ordered! Thou hast a Son, if what they tell us is true, and yet Thou\nleavest us to suffer so through our children. My darlings, my darlings! to think that trouble only should\nbring you to me, that I should only see you with tears on your faces! Ah! yes, yes, you love me, I see that\nyou love me. Come to me and pour out your griefs to me; my heart is large enough to hold them all. Oh!\nyou might rend my heart in pieces, and every fragment would make a father's heart. If only I could bear\nall your sorrows for you! . . . Ah! you were so happy when you were little and still with me. . . .\"\n\n\"We have never been happy since,\" said Delphine. \"Where are the old days when we slid down\nthe sacks in the great granary?\"\n\"That is not all, father,\" said Anastasie in Goriot's ear. The old man gave a startled shudder. \"The\ndiamonds only sold for a hundred thousand francs. Maxime is hard pressed. There are twelve thousand\nfrancs still to pay. He has given me his word that he will be steady and give up play in future. His love is\nall that I have left in the world. I have paid such a fearful price for it that I should die if I lose him now. I\nhave sacrificed my fortune, my honor, my peace of mind, and my children for him. Oh! do something, so\nthat at the least Maxime may be at large and live undisgraced in the world, where he will assuredly make\na career for himself. Something more than my happiness is at stake; the children have nothing, and if he is\nsent to Sainte-Pelagie all his prospects will be ruined.\"\n\"I haven't the money, Nasie. I have _nothing_--nothing left. This is the end of everything. Yes,\nthe world is crumbling into ruin, I am sure. Fly! Save yourselves! Ah!--I have still my silver buckles left,\nand half-a-dozen silver spoons and forks, the first I ever had in my life. But I have nothing else except my\nlife annuity, twelve hundred francs . . .\"\n\"Then what has become of your money in the funds?\"\n\"I sold out, and only kept a trifle for my wants. I wanted twelve thousand francs to furnish some\nrooms for Delphine.\"\n\"In your own house?\" asked Mme. de Restaud, looking at her sister.\n\"What does it matter where they were?\" asked Goriot. \"The money is spent now.\"\n\"I see how it is,\" said the Countess. \"Rooms for M. de Rastignac. Poor Delphine, take warning by\nme!\"\n\"M. de Rastignac is incapable of ruining the woman he loves, dear.\"\n\"Thanks! Delphine. I thought you would have been kinder to me in my troubles, but you never\ndid love me.\"\n\"Yes, yes, she loves you, Nasie,\" cried Goriot; \"she was saying so only just now. We were talking\nabout you, and she insisted that you were beautiful, and that she herself was only pretty!\"\n\"Pretty!\" said the Countess. \"She is as hard as a marble statue.\"\n\"And if I am?\" cried Delphine, flushing up, \"how have you treated me? You would not recognize\nme; you closed the doors of every house against me; you have never let an opportunity of mortifying me\nslip by. And when did I come, as you were always doing, to drain our poor father, a thousand francs at a\ntime, till he is left as you see him now? That is all your doing, sister! I myself have seen my father as\noften as I could. I have not turned him out of the house, and then come and fawned upon him when I\nwanted money. I did not so much as know that he had spent those twelve thousand francs on me. I am\neconomical, as you know; and when papa has made me presents, it has never been because I came and\nbegged for them.\"\n\"You were better off than I. M. de Marsay was rich, as you have reason to know. You always\n\nwere as slippery as gold. Good-bye; I have neither sister nor----\"\n\"Oh! hush, hush, Nasie!\" cried her father.\n\"Nobody else would repeat what everybody has ceased to believe. You are an unnatural sister!\"\ncried Delphine.\n\"Oh, children, children! hush! hush! or I will kill myself before your eyes.\"\n\"There, Nasie, I forgive you,\" said Mme. de Nucingen; \"you are very unhappy. But I am kinder\nthan you are. How could you say _that_ just when I was ready to do anything in the world to help you,\neven to be reconciled with my husband, which for my own sake I----Oh! it is just like you; you have\nbehaved cruelly to me all through these nine years.\"\n\"Children, children, kiss each other!\" cried the father. \"You are angels, both of you.\"\n\"No. Let me alone,\" cried the Countess shaking off the hand that her father had laid on her arm.\n\"She is more merciless than my husband. Any one might think she was a model of all the virtues herself!\"\n\"I would rather have people think that I owed money to M. de Marsay than own that M. de\nTrailles had cost me more than two hundred thousand francs,\" retorted Mme. de Nucingen.\n\"_Delphine!_\" cried the Countess, stepping towards her sister.\n\"I shall tell you the truth about yourself if you begin to slander me,\" said the Baroness coldly.\n\"Delphine! you are a ----\"\nFather Goriot sprang between them, grasped the Countess' hand, and laid his own over her mouth.\n\"Good heavens, father! What have you been handling this morning?\" said Anastasie.\n\"Ah! well, yes, I ought not to have touched you,\" said the poor father, wiping his hands on his\ntrousers, \"but I have been packing up my things; I did not know that you were coming to see me.\"\nHe was glad that he had drawn down her wrath upon himself.\n\"Ah!\" he sighed, as he sat down, \"you children have broken my heart between you. This is killing\nme. My head feels as if it were on fire. Be good to each other and love each other! This will be the death\nof me! Delphine! Nasie! come, be sensible; you are both in the wrong. Come, Dedel,\" he added, looking\nthrough his tears at the Baroness, \"she must have twelve thousand francs, you see; let us see if we can\nfind them for her. Oh, my girls, do not look at each other like that!\" and he sank on his knees beside\nDelphine. \"Ask her to forgive you --just to please me,\" he said in her ear. \"She is more miserable than you\nare. Come now, Dedel.\"\n\"Poor Nasie!\" said Delphine, alarmed at the wild extravagant grief in her father's face, \"I was in\nthe wrong, kiss me----\"\n\"Ah! that is like balm to my heart,\" cried Father Goriot. \"But how are we to find twelve thousand\n\nfrancs? I might offer myself as a substitute in the army----\"\n\"Oh! father dear!\" they both cried, flinging their arms about him. \"No, no!\"\n\"God reward you for the thought. We are not worth it, are we, Nasie?\" asked Delphine.\n\"And besides, father dear, it would only be a drop in the bucket,\" observed the Countess.\n\"But is flesh and blood worth nothing?\" cried the old man in his despair. \"I would give body and\nsoul to save you, Nasie. I would do a murder for the man who would rescue you. I would do, as Vautrin\ndid, go to the hulks, go----\" he stopped as if struck by a thunderbolt, and put both hands to his head.\n\"Nothing left!\" he cried, tearing his hair. \"If I only knew of a way to steal money, but it is so hard to do it,\nand then you can't set to work by yourself, and it takes time to rob a bank. Yes, it is time I was dead; there\nis nothing left me to do but to die. I am no good in the world; I am no longer a father! No. She has come\nto me in her extremity, and, wretch that I am, I have nothing to give her. Ah! you put your money into a\nlife annuity, old scoundrel; and had you not daughters? You did not love them. Die, die in a ditch, like the\ndog that you are! Yes, I am worse than a dog; a beast would not have done as I have done! Oh! my head .\n. . it throbs as if it would burst.\"\n\"Papa!\" cried both the young women at once, \"do, pray, be reasonable!\" and they clung to him to\nprevent him from dashing his head against the wall. There was a sound of sobbing.\nEugene, greatly alarmed, took the bill that bore Vautrin's signature, saw that the stamp would\nsuffice for a larger sum, altered the figures, made it into a regular bill for twelve thousand francs, payable\nto Goriot's order, and went to his neighbor's room.\n\"Here is the money, madame,\" he said, handing the piece of paper to her. \"I was asleep; your\nconversation awoke me, and by this means I learned all that I owed to M. Goriot. This bill can be\ndiscounted, and I shall meet it punctually at the due date.\"\nThe Countess stood motionless and speechless, but she held the bill in her fingers.\n\"Delphine,\" she said, with a white face, and her whole frame quivering with indignation, anger,\nand rage, \"I forgave you everything; God is my witness that I forgave you, but I cannot forgive this! So\nthis gentleman was there all the time, and you knew it! Your petty spite has let you to wreak your\nvengeance on me by betraying my secrets, my life, my children's lives, my shame, my honor! There, you\nare nothing to me any longer. I hate you. I will do all that I can to injure you. I will . . .\"\nAnger paralyzed her; the words died in her dry parched throat.\n\"Why, he is my son, my child; he is your brother, your preserver!\" cried Goriot. \"Kiss his hand,\nNasie! Stay, I will embrace him myself,\" he said, straining Eugene to his breast in a frenzied clasp. \"Oh\nmy boy! I will be more than a father to you; if I had God's power, I would fling worlds at your feet. Why\ndon't you kiss him, Nasie? He is not a man, but an angel, a angel out of heaven.\"\n\"Never mind her, father; she is mad just now.\"\n\"Mad! am I? And what are you?\" cried Mme. de Restaud.\n\n\"Children, children, I shall die if you go on like this,\" cried the old man, and he staggered and fell\non the bed as if a bullet had struck him.--\"They are killing me between them,\" he said to himself.\nThe Countess fixed her eyes on Eugene, who stood stock still; all his faculties were numbed by\nthis violent scene.\n\"Sir? . . .\" she said, doubt and inquiry in her face, tone, and bearing; she took no notice now of\nher father nor of Delphine, who was hastily unfastening his waistcoat.\n\"Madame,\" said Eugene, answering the question before it was asked, \"I will meet the bill, and\nkeep silence about it.\"\n\"You have killed our father, Nasie!\" said Delphine, pointing to Goriot, who lay unconscious on\nthe bed. The Countess fled.\n\"I freely forgive her,\" said the old man, opening his eyes; \"her position is horrible; it would turn\nan older head than hers. Comfort Nasie, and be nice to her, Delphine; promise it to your poor father\nbefore he dies,\" he asked, holding Delphine's hand in a convulsive clasp.\n\"Oh! what ails you, father?\" she cried in real alarm.\n\"Nothing, nothing,\" said Goriot; \"it will go off. There is something heavy pressing on my\nforehead, a little headache. . . . Ah! poor Nasie, what a life lies before her!\"\nJust as he spoke, the Countess came back again and flung herself on her knees before him.\n\"Forgive me!\" she cried.\n\"Come,\" said her father, \"you are hurting me still more.\"\n\"Monsieur,\" the Countess said, turning to Rastignac, \"misery made me unjust to you. You will be\na brother to me, will you not?\" and she held out her hand. Her eyes were full of tears as she spoke.\n\"Nasie,\" cried Delphine, flinging her arms round her sister, \"my little Nasie, let us forget and\nforgive.\"\n\"No, no,\" cried Nasie; \"I shall never forget!\"\n\"Dear angels,\" cried Goriot, \"it is as if a dark curtain over my eyes had been raised; your voices\nhave called me back to life. Kiss each other once more. Well, now, Nasie, that bill will save you, won't\nit?\"\n\"I hope so. I say, papa, will you write your name on it?\"\n\"There! how stupid of me to forget that! But I am not feeling at all well, Nasie, so you must not\nremember it against me. Send and let me know as soon as you are out of your strait. No, I will go to you.\nNo, after all, I will not go; I might meet your husband, and I should kill him on the spot. And as for\nsigning away your property, I shall have a word to say about that. Quick, my child, and keep Maxime in\norder in future.\"\n\nEugene was too bewildered to speak.\n\"Poor Anastasie, she always had a violent temper,\" said Mme. de Nucingen, \"but she has a good\nheart.\"\n\"She came back for the endorsement,\" said Eugene in Delphine's ear.\n\"Do you think so?\"\n\"I only wish I could think otherwise. Do not trust her,\" he answered, raising his eyes as if he\nconfided to heaven the thoughts that he did not venture to express.\n\"Yes. She is always acting a part to some extent.\"\n\"How do you feel now, dear Father Goriot?\" asked Rastignac.\n\"I should like to go to sleep,\" he replied.\nEugene helped him to bed, and Delphine sat by the bedside, holding his hand until he fell asleep.\nThen she went.\n\"This evening at the Italiens,\" she said to Eugene, \"and you can let me know how he is.\nTo-morrow you will leave this place, monsieur. Let us go into your room.--Oh! how frightful!\" she cried\non the threshold. \"Why, you are even worse lodged than our father. Eugene, you have behaved well. I\nwould love you more if that were possible; but, dear boy, if you are to succeed in life, you must not begin\nby flinging twelve thousand francs out of the windows like that. The Comte de Trailles is a confirmed\ngambler. My sister shuts her eyes to it. He would have made the twelve thousand francs in the same way\nthat he wins and loses heaps of gold.\"\nA groan from the next room brought them back to Goriot's bedside; to all appearances he was\nasleep, but the two lovers caught the words, \"They are not happy!\" Whether he was awake or sleeping,\nthe tone in which they were spoken went to his daughter's heart. She stole up to the pallet-bed on which\nher father lay, and kissed his forehead. He opened his eyes.\n\"Ah! Delphine!\" he said.\n\"How are you now?\" she asked.\n\"Quite comfortable. Do not worry about me; I shall get up presently. Don't stay with me,\nchildren; go, go and be happy.\"\nEugene went back with Delphine as far as her door; but he was not easy about Goriot, and would\nnot stay to dinner, as she proposed. He wanted to be back at the Maison Vauquer. Father Goriot had left\nhis room, and was just sitting down to dinner as he came in. Bianchon had placed himself where he could\nwatch the old man carefully; and when the old vermicelli maker took up his square of bread and smelled\nit to find out the quality of the flour, the medical student, studying him closely, saw that the action was\npurely mechanical, and shook his head.\n\"Just come and sit over here, hospitaller of Cochin,\" said Eugene.\n\nBianchon went the more willingly because his change of place brought him next to the old lodger.\n\"What is wrong with him?\" asked Rastignac.\n\"It is all up with him, or I am much mistaken! Something very extraordinary must have taken\nplace; he looks to me as if he were in imminent danger of serous apoplexy. The lower part of his face is\ncomposed enough, but the upper part is drawn and distorted. Then there is that peculiar look about the\neyes that indicates an effusion of serum in the brain; they look as though they were covered with a film of\nfine dust, do you notice? I shall know more about it by to-morrow morning.\"\n\"Is there any cure for it?\"\n\"None. It might be possible to stave death off for a time if a way could be found of setting up a\nreaction in the lower extremities; but if the symptoms do not abate by to-morrow evening, it will be all\nover with him, poor old fellow! Do you know what has happened to bring this on? There must have been\nsome violent shock, and his mind has given way.\"\n\"Yes, there was,\" said Rastignac, remembering how the two daughters had struck blow on blow at\ntheir father's heart.\n\"But Delphine at any rate loves her father,\" he said to himself.\nThat evening at the opera Rastignac chose his words carefully, lest he should give Mme. de\nNucingen needless alarm.\n\"Do not be anxious about him,\" she said, however, as soon as Eugene began, \"our father has\nreally a strong constitution, but this morning we gave him a shock. Our whole fortunes were in peril, so\nthe thing was serious, you see. I could not live if your affection did not make me insensible to troubles\nthat I should once have thought too hard to bear. At this moment I have but one fear left, but one misery\nto dread--to lose the love that has made me feel glad to live. Everything else is as nothing to me compared\nwith our love; I care for nothing else, for you are all the world to me. If I feel glad to be rich, it is for your\nsake. To my shame be it said, I think of my lover before my father. Do you ask why? I cannot tell you,\nbut all my life is in you. My father gave me a heart, but you have taught it to beat. The whole world may\ncondemn me; what does it matter if I stand acquitted in your eyes, for you have no right to think ill of me\nfor the faults which a tyrannous love has forced me to commit for you! Do you think me an unnatural\ndaughter? Oh! no, no one could help loving such a dear kind father as ours. But how could I hide the\ninevitable consequences of our miserable marriages from him? Why did he allow us to marry when we\ndid? Was it not his duty to think for us and foresee for us? To-day I know he suffers as much as we do,\nbut how can it be helped? And as for comforting him, we could not comfort him in the least. Our\nresignation would give him more pain and hurt him far more than complaints and upbraidings. There are\ntimes in life when everything turns to bitterness.\"\nEugene was silent, the artless and sincere outpouring made an impression on him.\nParisian women are often false, intoxicated with vanity, selfish and self-absorbed, frivolous and\nshallow; yet of all women, when they love, they sacrifice their personal feelings to their passion; they rise\nbut so much the higher for all the pettiness overcome in their nature, and become sublime. Then Eugene\nwas struck by the profound discernment and insight displayed by this woman in judging of natural\naffection, when a privileged affection had separated and set her at a distance apart. Mme. de Nucingen\n\nwas piqued by the silence,\n\"What are you thinking about?\" she asked.\n\"I am thinking about what you said just now. Hitherto I have always felt sure that I cared far more\nfor you than you did for me.\"\nShe smiled, and would not give way to the happiness she felt, lest their talk should exceed the\nconventional limits of propriety. She had never heard the vibrating tones of a sincere and youthful love; a\nfew more words, and she feared for her self-control.\n\"Eugene,\" she said, changing the conversation, \"I wonder whether you know what has been\nhappening? All Paris will go to Mme. de Beauseant's to-morrow. The Rochefides and the Marquis\nd'Ajuda have agreed to keep the matter a profound secret, but to-morrow the king will sign the\nmarriage-contract, and your poor cousin the Vicomtesse knows nothing of it as yet. She cannot put off her\nball, and the Marquis will not be there. People are wondering what will happen?\"\n\"The world laughs at baseness and connives at it. But this will kill Mme. de Beauseant.\"\n\"Oh, no,\" said Delphine, smiling, \"you do not know that kind of woman. Why, all Paris will be\nthere, and so shall I; I ought to go there for your sake.\"\n\"Perhaps, after all, it is one of those absurd reports that people set in circulation here.\"\n\"We shall know the truth to-morrow.\"\nEugene did not return to the Maison Vauquer. He could not forego the pleasure of occupying his\nnew rooms in the Rue d'Artois. Yesterday evening he had been obliged to leave Delphine soon after\nmidnight, but that night it was Delphine who stayed with him until two o'clock in the morning. He rose\nlate, and waited for Mme. de Nucingen, who came about noon to breakfast with him. Youth snatches\neagerly at these rosy moments of happiness, and Eugene had almost forgotten Goriot's existence. The\npretty things that surrounded him were growing familiar; this domestication in itself was one long festival\nfor him, and Mme. de Nucingen was there to glorify it all by her presence. It was four o'clock before they\nthought of Goriot, and of how he had looked forward to the new life in that house. Eugene said that the\nold man ought to be moved at once, lest he should grow too ill to move. He left Delphine and hurried\nback to the lodging-house. Neither Father Goriot nor young Bianchon was in the dining-room with the\nothers.\n\"Aha!\" said the painter as Eugene came in, \"Father Goriot has broken down at last. Bianchon is\nupstairs with him. One of his daughters--the Comtesse de Restaurama--came to see the old gentleman,\nand he would get up and go out, and made himself worse. Society is about to lose one of its brightest\nornaments.\"\nRastignac sprang to the staircase.\n\"Hey! Monsieur Eugene!\"\n\"Monsieur Eugene, the mistress is calling you,\" shouted Sylvie.\n\n\"It is this, sir,\" said the widow. \"You and M. Goriot should by rights have moved out on the 15th\nof February. That was three days ago; to-day is the 18th, I ought really to be paid a month in advance; but\nif you will engage to pay for both, I shall be quite satisfied.\"\n\"Why can't you trust him?\"\n\"Trust him, indeed! If the old gentleman went off his head and died, those daughters of his would\nnot pay me a farthing, and his things won't fetch ten francs. This morning he went out with all the spoons\nand forks he has left, I don't know why. He had got himself up to look quite young, and--Lord, forgive\nme--but I thought he had rouge on his cheeks; he looked quite young again.\"\n\"I will be responsible,\" said Eugene, shuddering with horror, for he foresaw the end.\nHe climbed the stairs and reached Father Goriot's room. The old man was tossing on his bed.\nBianchon was with him.\n\"Good-evening, father,\" said Eugene.\nThe old man turned his glassy eyes on him, smiled gently, and said:\n\"How is _she_?\"\n\"She is quite well. But how are you?\"\n\"There is nothing much the matter.\"\n\"Don't tire him,\" said Bianchon, drawing Eugene into a corner of the room.\n\"Well?\" asked Rastignac.\n\"Nothing but a miracle can save him now. Serous congestion has set in; I have put on mustard\nplasters, and luckily he can feel them, they are acting.\"\n\"Is it possible to move him?\"\n\"Quite out of the question. He must stay where he is, and be kept as quiet as possible----\"\n\"Dear Bianchon,\" said Eugene, \"we will nurse him between us.\"\n\"I have had the head physician round from my hospital to see him.\"\n\"And what did he say?\"\n\"He will give no opinion till to-morrow evening. He promised to look in again at the end of the\nday. Unluckily, the preposterous creature must needs go and do something foolish this morning; he will\nnot say what it was. He is as obstinate as a mule. As soon as I begin to talk to him he pretends not to hear,\nand lies as if he were asleep instead of answering, or if he opens his eyes he begins to groan. Some time\nthis morning he went out on foot in the streets, nobody knows where he went, and he took everything that\nhe had of any value with him. He has been driving some confounded bargain, and it has been too much\n\nfor his strength. One of his daughters has been here.\"\n\"Was it the Countess?\" asked Eugene. \"A tall, dark-haired woman, with large bright eyes, slender\nfigure, and little feet?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"Leave him to me for a bit,\" said Rastignac. \"I will make him confess; he will tell me all about it.\"\n\"And meanwhile I will get my dinner. But try not to excite him; there is still some hope left.\"\n\"All right.\"\n\"How they will enjoy themselves to-morrow,\" said Father Goriot when they were alone. \"They\nare going to a grand ball.\"\n\"What were you doing this morning, papa, to make yourself so poorly this evening that you have\nto stop in bed?\"\n\"Nothing.\"\n\"Did not Anastasie come to see you?\" demanded Rastignac.\n\"Yes,\" said Father Goriot.\n\"Well, then, don't keep anything from me. What more did she want of you?\"\n\"Oh, she was very miserable,\" he answered, gathering up all his strength to speak. \"It was this\nway, my boy. Since that affair of the diamonds, Nasie has not had a penny of her own. For this ball she\nhad ordered a golden gown like a setting for a jewel. Her mantuamaker, a woman without a conscience,\nwould not give her credit, so Nasie's waiting-woman advanced a thousand francs on account. Poor Nasie!\nreduced to such shifts! It cut me to the heart to think of it! But when Nasie's maid saw how things were\nbetween her master and mistress, she was afraid of losing her money, and came to an understanding with\nthe dressmaker, and the woman refuses to send the ball-dress until the money is paid. The gown is ready,\nand the ball is to-morrow night! Nasie was in despair. She wanted to borrow my forks and spoons to\npawn them. Her husband is determined that she shall go and wear the diamonds, so as to contradict the\nstories that are told all over Paris. How can she go to that heartless scoundrel and say, 'I owe a thousand\nfrancs to my dressmaker; pay her for me!' She cannot. I saw that myself. Delphine will be there too in a\nsuperb toilette, and Anastasie ought not to be outshone by her younger sister. And then --she was\ndrowned in tears, poor girl! I felt so humbled yesterday when I had not the twelve thousand francs, that I\nwould have given the rest of my miserable life to wipe out that wrong. You see, I could have borne\nanything once, but latterly this want of money has broken my heart. Oh! I did not do it by halves; I\ntitivated myself up a bit, and went out and sold my spoons and forks and buckles for six hundred francs;\nthen I went to old Daddy Gobseck, and sold a year's interest on my annuity for four hundred francs down.\nPshaw! I can live on dry bread, as I did when I was a young man; if I have done it before, I can do it\nagain. My Nasie shall have one happy evening, at any rate. She shall be smart. The banknote for a\nthousand francs is under my pillow; it warms me to have it lying there under my head, for it is going to\nmake my poor Nasie happy. She can turn that bad girl Victoire out of the house. A servant that cannot\ntrust her mistress, did any one ever hear the like! I shall be quite well to-morrow. Nasie is coming at ten\n\no'clock. They must not think that I am ill, or they will not go to the ball; they will stop and take care of\nme. To-morrow Nasie will come and hold me in her arms as if I were one of her children; her kisses will\nmake me well again. After all, I might have spent the thousand francs on physic; I would far rather give\nthem to my little Nasie, who can charm all the pain away. At any rate, I am some comfort to her in her\nmisery; and that makes up for my unkindness in buying an annuity. She is in the depths, and I cannot\ndraw her out of them now. Oh! I will go into business again, I will buy wheat in Odessa; out there, wheat\nfetches a quarter of the price it sells for here. There is a law against the importation of grain, but the good\nfolk who made the law forgot to prohibit the introduction of wheat products and food stuffs made from\ncorn. Hey! hey! . . . That struck me this morning. There is a fine trade to be done in starch.\"\nEugene, watching the old man's face, thought that his friend was light-headed.\n\"Come,\" he said, \"do not talk any more, you must rest----\" Just then Bianchon came up, and\nEugene went down to dinner.\nThe two students sat up with him that night, relieving each other in turn. Bianchon brought up his\nmedical books and studied; Eugene wrote letters home to his mother and sisters. Next morning Bianchon\nthought the symptoms more hopeful, but the patient's condition demanded continual attention, which the\ntwo students alone were willing to give--a task impossible to describe in the squeamish phraseology of\nthe epoch. Leeches must be applied to the wasted body, the poultices and hot foot-baths, and other details\nof the treatment required the physical strength and devotion of the two young men. Mme. de Restaud did\nnot come; but she sent a messenger for the money.\n\"I expected she would come herself; but it would have been a pity for her to come, she would\nhave been anxious about me,\" said the father, and to all appearances he was well content.\nAt seven o'clock that evening Therese came with a letter from Delphine.\n\"What are you doing, dear friend? I have been loved for a very little while, and I am neglected\nalready? In the confidences of heart and heart, I have learned to know your soul--you are too noble not\nto be faithful for ever, for you know that love with all its infinite subtle changes of feeling is never the\nsame. Once you said, as we were listening to the Prayer in _Mose in Egitto_, 'For some it is the\nmonotony of a single note; for others, it is the infinite of sound.' Remember that I am expecting you this\nevening to take me to Mme. de Beauseant's ball. Every one knows now that the King signed M.\nd'Ajuda's marriage-contract this morning, and the poor Vicomtesse knew nothing of it until two o'clock\nthis afternoon. All Paris will flock to her house, of course, just as a crowd fills the Place de Greve to\nsee an execution. It is horrible, is it not, to go out of curiosity to see if she will hide her anguish, and\nwhether she will die courageously? I certainly should not go, my friend, if I had been at her house\nbefore; but, of course, she will not receive society any more after this, and all my efforts would be in\nvain. My position is a very unusual one, and besides, I am going there partly on your account. I am\nwaiting for you. If you are not beside me in less than two hours, I do not know whether I could forgive\nsuch treason.\"\nRastignac took up a pen and wrote:\n\"I am waiting till the doctor comes to know if there is any hope of your father's life. He is lying\ndangerously ill. I will come and bring you the news, but I am afraid it may be a sentence of death.\nWhen I come you can decide whether you can go to the ball.--Yours a thousand times.\"\n\nAt half-past eight the doctor arrived. He did not take a very hopeful view of the case, but thought\nthat there was no immediate danger. Improvements and relapses might be expected, and the good man's\nlife and reason hung in the balance.\n\"It would be better for him to die at once,\" the doctor said as he took leave.\nEugene left Goriot to Bianchon's care, and went to carry the sad news to Mme. de Nucingen.\nFamily feeling lingered in her, and this must put an end for the present to her plans of amusement.\n\"Tell her to enjoy her evening as if nothing had happened,\" cried Goriot. He had been lying in a\nsort of stupor, but he suddenly sat upright as Eugene went out.\nEugene, half heartbroken, entered Delphine's. Her hair had been dressed; she wore her dancing\nslippers; she had only to put on her ball-dress; but when the artist is giving the finishing stroke to his\ncreation, the last touches require more time than the whole groundwork of the picture.\n\"Why, you are not dressed!\" she cried.\n\"Madame, your father----\"\n\"My father again!\" she exclaimed, breaking in upon him. \"You need not teach me what is due to\nmy father, I have known my father this long while. Not a word, Eugene. I will hear what you have to say\nwhen you are dressed. My carriage is waiting, take it, go round to your rooms and dress, Therese has put\nout everything in readiness for you. Come back as soon as you can; we will talk about my father on the\nway to Mme. de Beauseant's. We must go early; if we have to wait our turn in a row of carriages, we shall\nbe lucky if we get there by eleven o'clock.\"\n\"Madame----\"\n\"Quick! not a word!\" she cried, darting into her dressing-room for a necklace.\n\"Do go, Monsieur Eugene, or you will vex madame,\" said Therese, hurrying him away; and\nEugene was too horror-stricken by this elegant parricide to resist.\nHe went to his rooms and dressed, sad, thoughtful, and dispirited. The world of Paris was like an\nocean of mud for him just then; and it seemed that whoever set foot in that black mire must needs sink\ninto it up to the chin.\n\"Their crimes are paltry,\" said Eugene to himself. \"Vautrin was greater.\"\nHe had seen society in its three great phases--Obedience, Struggle, and Revolt; the Family, the\nWorld, and Vautrin; and he hesitated in his choice. Obedience was dull, Revolt impossible, Struggle\nhazardous. His thoughts wandered back to the home circle. He thought of the quiet uneventful life, the\npure happiness of the days spent among those who loved him there. Those loving and beloved beings\npassed their lives in obedience to the natural laws of the hearth, and in that obedience found a deep and\nconstant serenity, unvexed by torments such as these. Yet, for all his good impulses, he could not bring\nhimself to make profession of the religion of pure souls to Delphine, nor to prescribe the duties of piety to\nher in the name of love. His education had begun to bear its fruits; he loved selfishly already. Besides, his\ntact had discovered to him the real nature of Delphine; he divined instinctively that she was capable of\n\nstepping over her father's corpse to go to the ball; and within himself he felt that he had neither the\nstrength of mind to play the part of mentor, nor the strength of character to vex her, nor the courage to\nleave her to go alone.\n\"She would never forgive me for putting her in the wrong over it,\" he said to himself. Then he\nturned the doctor's dictum over in his mind; he tried to believe that Goriot was not so dangerously ill as he\nhad imagined, and ended by collecting together a sufficient quantity of traitorous excuses for Delphine's\nconduct. She did not know how ill her father was; the kind old man himself would have made her go to\nthe ball if she had gone to see him. So often it happens that this one or that stands condemned by the\nsocial laws that govern family relations; and yet there are peculiar circumstances in the case, differences\nof temperament, divergent interests, innumerable complications of family life that excuse the apparent\noffence.\nEugene did not wish to see too clearly; he was ready to sacrifice his conscience to his mistress.\nWithin the last few days his whole life had undergone a change. Woman had entered into his world and\nthrown it into chaos, family claims dwindled away before her; she had appropriated all his being to her\nuses. Rastignac and Delphine found each other at a crisis in their lives when their union gave them the\nmost poignant bliss. Their passion, so long proved, had only gained in strength by the gratified desire that\noften extinguishes passion. This woman was his, and Eugene recognized that not until then had he loved\nher; perhaps love is only gratitude for pleasure. This woman, vile or sublime, he adored for the pleasure\nshe had brought as her dower; and Delphine loved Rastignac as Tantalus would have loved some angel\nwho had satisfied his hunger and quenched the burning thirst in his parched throat.\n\"Well,\" said Mme. de Nucingen when he came back in evening dress, \"how is my father?\"\n\"Very dangerously ill,\" he answered; \"if you will grant me a proof of your affections, we will just\ngo in to see him on the way.\"\n\"Very well,\" she said. \"Yes, but afterwards. Dear Eugene, do be nice, and don't preach to me.\nCome.\"\nThey set out. Eugene said nothing for a while.\n\"What is it now?\" she asked.\n\"I can hear the death-rattle in your father's throat,\" he said almost angrily. And with the hot\nindignation of youth, he told the story of Mme. de Restaud's vanity and cruelty, of her father's final act of\nself-sacrifice, that had brought about this struggle between life and death, of the price that had been paid\nfor Anastasie's golden embroideries. Delphine cried.\n\"I shall look frightful,\" she thought. She dried her tears.\n\"I will nurse my father; I will not leave his bedside,\" she said aloud.\n\"Ah! now you are as I would have you,\" exclaimed Rastignac.\nThe lamps of five hundred carriages lit up the darkness about the Hotel de Beauseant. A\ngendarme in all the glory of his uniform stood on either side of the brightly lighted gateway. The great\nworld was flocking thither that night in its eager curiosity to see the great lady at the moment of her fall,\n\nand the rooms on the ground floor were already full to overflowing, when Mme. de Nucingen and\nRastignac appeared. Never since Louis XIV. tore her lover away from La grand Mademoiselle, and the\nwhole court hastened to visit that unfortunate princess, had a disastrous love affair made such a sensation\nin Paris. But the youngest daughter of the almost royal house of Burgundy had risen proudly above her\npain, and moved till the last moment like a queen in this world--its vanities had always been valueless for\nher, save in so far as they contributed to the triumph of her passion. The salons were filled with the most\nbeautiful women in Paris, resplendent in their toilettes, and radiant with smiles. Ministers and\nambassadors, the most distinguished men at court, men bedizened with decorations, stars, and ribbons,\nmen who bore the most illustrious names in France, had gathered about the Vicomtesse.\nThe music of the orchestra vibrated in wave after wave of sound from the golden ceiling of the\npalace, now made desolate for its queen.\nMadame de Beauseant stood at the door of the first salon to receive the guests who were styled\nher friends. She was dressed in white, and wore no ornament in the plaits of hair braided about her head;\nher face was calm; there was no sign there of pride, nor of pain, nor of joy that she did not feel. No one\ncould read her soul; she stood there like some Niobe carved in marble. For a few intimate friends there\nwas a tinge of satire in her smile; but no scrutiny saw any change in her, nor had she looked otherwise in\nthe days of the glory of her happiness. The most callous of her guests admired her as young Rome\napplauded some gladiator who could die smiling. It seemed as if society had adorned itself for a last\naudience of one of its sovereigns.\n\"I was afraid that you would not come,\" she said to Rastignac.\n\"Madame,\" he said, in an unsteady voice, taking her speech as a reproach, \"I shall be the last to\ngo, that is why I am here.\"\n\"Good,\" she said, and she took his hand. \"You are perhaps the only one I can trust here among all\nthese. Oh, my friend, when you love, love a woman whom you are sure that you can love always. Never\nforsake a woman.\"\nShe took Rastignac's arm, and went towards a sofa in the card-room.\n\"I want you to go to the Marquis,\" she said. \"Jacques, my footman, will go with you; he has a\nletter that you will take. I am asking the Marquis to give my letters back to me. He will give them all up, I\nlike to think that. When you have my letters, go up to my room with them. Some one shall bring me\nword.\"\nShe rose to go to meet the Duchesse de Langeais, her most intimate friend, who had come like the\nrest of the world.\nRastignac went. He asked for the Marquis d'Ajuda at the Hotel Rochefide, feeling certain that the\nlatter would be spending his evening there, and so it proved. The Marquis went to his own house with\nRastignac, and gave a casket to the student, saying as he did so, \"They are all there.\"\nHe seemed as if he was about to say something to Eugene, to ask about the ball, or the\nVicomtesse; perhaps he was on the brink of the confession that, even then, he was in despair, and knew\nthat his marriage had been a fatal mistake; but a proud gleam shone in his eyes, and with deplorable\ncourage he kept his noblest feelings a secret.\n\n\"Do not even mention my name to her, my dear Eugene.\" He grasped Rastignac's hand sadly and\naffectionately, and turned away from him. Eugene went back to the Hotel Beauseant, the servant took him\nto the Vicomtesse's room. There were signs there of preparations for a journey. He sat down by the fire,\nfixed his eyes on the cedar wood casket, and fell into deep mournful musings. Mme. de Beauseant loomed\nlarge in these imaginings, like a goddess in the Iliad.\n\"Ah! my friend! . . .\" said the Vicomtesse; she crossed the room and laid her hand on Rastignac's\nshoulder. He saw the tears in his cousin's uplifted eyes, saw that one hand was raised to take the casket,\nand that the fingers of the other trembled. Suddenly she took the casket, put it in the fire, and watched it\nburn.\n\"They are dancing,\" she said. \"They all came very early; but death will be long in coming. Hush!\nmy friend,\" and she laid a finger on Rastignac's lips, seeing that he was about to speak. \"I shall never see\nParis again. I am taking my leave of the world. At five o'clock this morning I shall set out on my journey;\nI mean to bury myself in the remotest part of Normandy. I have had very little time to make my\narrangements; since three o'clock this afternoon I have been busy signing documents, setting my affairs in\norder; there was no one whom I could send to . . .\"\nShe broke off.\n\"He was sure to be . . .\"\nAgain she broke off; the weight of her sorrow was more than she could bear. In such moments as\nthese everything is agony, and some words are impossible to utter.\n\"And so I counted upon you to do me this last piece of service this evening,\" she said. \"I should\nlike to give you some pledge of friendship. I shall often think of you. You have seemed to me to be kind\nand noble, fresh-hearted and true, in this world where such qualities are seldom found. I should like you\nto think sometimes of me. Stay,\" she said, glancing about her, \"there is this box that has held my gloves.\nEvery time I opened it before going to a ball or to the theatre, I used to feel that I must be beautiful,\nbecause I was so happy; and I never touched it except to lay some gracious memory in it: there is so much\nof my old self in it, of a Madame de Beauseant who now lives no longer. Will you take it? I will leave\ndirections that it is to be sent to you in the Rue d'Artois.--Mme. de Nucingen looked very charming this\nevening. Eugene, you must love her. Perhaps we may never see each other again, my friend; but be sure\nof this, that I shall pray for you who have been kind to me.--Now, let us go downstairs. People shall not\nthink that I am weeping. I have all time and eternity before me, and where I am going I shall be alone, and\nno one will ask me the reason of my tears. One last look round first.\"\nShe stood for a moment. Then she covered her eyes with her hands for an instant, dashed away\nthe tears, bathed her face with cold water, and took the student's arm.\n\"Let us go!\" she said.\nThis suffering, endured with such noble fortitude, shook Eugene with a more violent emotion\nthan he had felt before. They went back to the ballroom, and Mme. de Beauseant went through the rooms\non Eugene's arm --the last delicately gracious act of a gracious woman. In another moment he saw the\nsisters, Mme. de Restaud and Mme. de Nucingen. The Countess shone in all the glory of her magnificent\ndiamonds; every stone must have scorched like fire, she was never to wear them again. Strong as love and\npride might be in her, she found it difficult to meet her husband's eyes. The sight of her was scarcely\n\ncalculated to lighten Rastignac's sad thoughts; through the blaze of those diamonds he seemed to see the\nwretched pallet-bed on which Father Goriot was lying. The Vicomtesse misread his melancholy; she\nwithdrew her hand from his arm.\n\"Come,\" she said, \"I must not deprive you of a pleasure.\"\nEugene was soon claimed by Delphine. She was delighted by the impression that she had made,\nand eager to lay at her lover's feet the homage she had received in this new world in which she hoped to\nlive and move henceforth.\n\"What do you think of Nasie?\" she asked him.\n\"She has discounted everything, even her own father's death,\" said Rastignac.\nTowards four o'clock in the morning the rooms began to empty. A little later the music ceased,\nand the Duchesse de Langeais and Rastignac were left in the great ballroom. The Vicomtesse, who\nthought to find the student there alone, came back there at last. She had taken leave of M. de Beauseant,\nwho had gone off to bed, saying again as he went, \"It is a great pity, my dear, to shut yourself up at your\nage! Pray stay among us.\"\nMme. de Beauseant saw the Duchesse, and, in spite of herself, an exclamation broke from her.\n\"I saw how it was, Clara,\" said Mme. de Langeais. \"You are going from among us, and you will\nnever come back. But you must not go until you have heard me, until we have understood each other.\"\nShe took her friend's arm, and they went together into the next room. There the Duchess looked at\nher with tears in her eyes; she held her friend in close embrace and kissed her cheek.\n\"I could not let you go without a word, dearest; the remorse would have been too hard to bear.\nYou can count upon me as surely as upon yourself. You have shown yourself great this evening; I feel\nthat I am worthy of our friendship, and I mean to prove myself worthy of it. I have not always been kind;\nI was in the wrong; forgive me, dearest; I wish I could unsay anything that may have hurt you; I take back\nthose words. One common sorrow has brought us together again, for I do not know which of us is the\nmore miserable. M. de Montriveau was not here to-night; do you understand what that means?--None of\nthose who saw you to-night, Clara, will ever forget you. I mean to make one last effort. If I fail, I shall go\ninto a convent. Clara, where are you going?\"\n\"Into Normandy, to Courcelles. I shall love and pray there until the day when God shall take me\nfrom this world.--M. de Rastignac!\" called the Vicomtesse, in a tremulous voice, remembering that the\nyoung man was waiting there.\nThe student knelt to kiss his cousin's hand.\n\"Good-bye, Antoinette!\" said Mme. de Beauseant. \"May you be happy.\" --She turned to the\nstudent. \"You are young,\" she said; \"you have some beliefs still left. I have been privileged, like some\ndying people, to find sincere and reverent feeling in those about me as I take my leave of this world.\"\nIt was nearly five o'clock that morning when Rastignac came away. He had put Mme. de\nBeauseant into her traveling carriage, and received her last farewells, spoken amid fast-falling tears; for\n\nno greatness is so great that it can rise above the laws of human affection, or live beyond the jurisdiction\nof pain, as certain demagogues would have the people believe. Eugene returned on foot to the Maison\nVauquer through the cold and darkness. His education was nearly complete.\n\"There is no hope for poor Father Goriot,\" said Bianchon, as Rastignac came into the room.\nEugene looked for a while at the sleeping man, then he turned to his friend. \"Dear fellow, you are content\nwith the modest career you have marked out for yourself; keep to it. I am in hell, and I must stay there.\nBelieve everything that you hear said of the world, nothing is too impossibly bad. No Juvenal could paint\nthe horrors hidden away under the covering of gems and gold.\"\nAt two o'clock in the afternoon Bianchon came to wake Rastignac, and begged him to take charge\nof Goriot, who had grown worse as the day wore on. The medical student was obliged to go out.\n\"Poor old man, he has not two days to live, maybe not many hours,\" he said; \"but we must do our\nutmost, all the same, to fight the disease. It will be a very troublesome case, and we shall want money.\nWe can nurse him between us, of course, but, for my own part, I have not a penny. I have turned out his\npockets, and rummaged through his drawers--result, nix. I asked him about it while his mind was clear,\nand he told me he had not a farthing of his own. What have you?\"\n\"I have twenty francs left,\" said Rastignac; \"but I will take them to the roulette table, I shall be\nsure to win.\"\n\"And if you lose?\"\n\"Then I shall go to his sons-in-law and his daughters and ask them for money.\"\n\"And suppose they refuse?\" Bianchon retorted. \"The most pressing thing just now is not really\nmoney; we must put mustard poultices, as hot as they can be made, on his feet and legs. If he calls out,\nthere is still some hope for him. You know how to set about doing it, and besides, Christophe will help\nyou. I am going round to the dispensary to persuade them to let us have the things we want on credit. It is\na pity that we could not move him to the hospital; poor fellow, he would be better there. Well, come\nalong, I leave you in charge; you must stay with him till I come back.\"\nThe two young men went back to the room where the old man was lying. Eugene was startled at\nthe change in Goriot's face, so livid, distorted, and feeble.\n\"How are you, papa?\" he said, bending over the pallet-bed. Goriot turned his dull eyes upon\nEugene, looked at him attentively, and did not recognize him. It was more than the student could bear; the\ntears came into his eyes.\n\"Bianchon, ought we to have the curtains put up in the windows?\"\n\"No, the temperature and the light do not affect him now. It would be a good thing for him if he\nfelt heat or cold; but we must have a fire in any case to make tisanes and heat the other things. I will send\nround a few sticks; they will last till we can have in some firewood. I burned all the bark fuel you had left,\nas well as his, poor man, yesterday and during the night. The place is so damp that the water stood in\ndrops on the walls; I could hardly get the room dry. Christophe came in and swept the floor, but the place\nis like a stable; I had to burn juniper, the smell was something horrible.\n\n\"_Mon Dieu!_\" said Rastignac. \"To think of those daughters of his.\"\n\"One moment, if he asks for something to drink, give him this,\" said the house student, pointing\nto a large white jar. \"If he begins to groan, and the belly feels hot and hard to the touch, you know what to\ndo; get Christophe to help you. If he should happen to grow much excited, and begin to talk a good deal\nand even to ramble in his talk, do not be alarmed. It would not be a bad symptom. But send Christophe to\nthe Hospice Cochin. Our doctor, my chum, or I will come and apply moxas. We had a great consultation\nthis morning while you were asleep. A surgeon, a pupil of Gall's came, and our house surgeon, and the\nhead physician from the Hotel-Dieu. Those gentlemen considered that the symptoms were very unusual\nand interesting; the case must be carefully watched, for it throws a light on several obscure and rather\nimportant scientific problems. One of the authorities says that if there is more pressure of serum on one or\nother portion of the brain, it should affect his mental capacities in such and such directions. So if he\nshould talk, notice very carefully what kind of ideas his mind seems to run on; whether memory, or\npenetration, or the reasoning faculties are exercised; whether sentiments or practical questions fill his\nthoughts; whether he makes forecasts or dwells on the past; in fact; you must be prepared to give an\naccurate report of him. It is quite likely that the extravasation fills the whole brain, in which case he will\ndie in the imbecile state in which he is lying now. You cannot tell anything about these mysterious\nnervous diseases. Suppose the crash came here,\" said Bianchon, touching the back of the head, \"very\nstrange things have been known to happen; the brain sometimes partially recovers, and death is delayed.\nOr the congested matter may pass out of the brain altogether through channels which can only be\ndetermined by a post-mortem examination. There is an old man at the Hospital for Incurables, an imbecile\npatient, in his case the effusion has followed the direction of the spinal cord; he suffers horrid agonies, but\nhe lives.\"\n\"Did they enjoy themselves?\" It was Father Goriot who spoke. He had recognized Eugene.\n\"Oh! he thinks of nothing but his daughters,\" said Bianchon. \"Scores of times last night he said to\nme, 'They are dancing now! She has her dress.' He called them by their names. He made me cry, the devil\ntake it, calling with that tone in his voice, for 'Delphine! my little Delphine! and Nasie!' Upon my word,\"\nsaid the medical student, \"it was enough to make any one burst out crying.\"\n\"Delphine,\" said the old man, \"she is there, isn't she? I knew she was there,\" and his eyes sought\nthe door.\n\"I am going down now to tell Sylvie to get the poultices ready,\" said Bianchon. \"They ought to\ngo on at once.\"\nRastignac was left alone with the old man. He sat at the foot of the bed, and gazed at the face\nbefore him, so horribly changed that it was shocking to see.\n\"Noble natures cannot dwell in this world,\" he said; \"Mme de Beauseant has fled from it, and\nthere he lies dying. What place indeed is there in the shallow petty frivolous thing called society for noble\nthoughts and feelings?\"\nPictures of yesterday's ball rose up in his memory, in strange contrast to the deathbed before him.\nBianchon suddenly appeared.\n\"I say, Eugene, I have just seen our head surgeon at the hospital, and I ran all the way back here.\nIf the old man shows any signs of reason, if he begins to talk, cover him with a mustard poultice from the\n\nneck to the base of the spine, and send round for us.\"\n\"Dear Bianchon,\" exclaimed Eugene.\n\"Oh! it is an interesting case from a scientific point of view,\" said the medical student, with all the\nenthusiasm of a neophyte.\n\"So!\" said Eugene. \"Am I really the only one who cares for the poor old man for his own sake?\"\n\"You would not have said so if you had seen me this morning,\" returned Bianchon, who did not\ntake offence at this speech. \"Doctors who have seen a good deal of practice never see anything but the\ndisease, but, my dear fellow, I can see the patient still.\"\nHe went. Eugene was left alone with the old man, and with an apprehension of a crisis that set in,\nin fact, before very long.\n\"Ah! dear boy, is that you?\" said Father Goriot, recognizing Eugene.\n\"Do you feel better?\" asked the law student, taking his hand.\n\"Yes. My head felt as if it were being screwed up in a vise, but now it is set free again. Did you\nsee my girls? They will be here directly; as soon as they know that I am ill they will hurry here at once;\nthey used to take such care of me in the Rue de la Jussienne! Great Heavens! if only my room was fit for\nthem to come into! There has been a young man here, who has burned up all my bark fuel.\"\n\"I can hear Christophe coming upstairs,\" Eugene answered. \"He is bringing up some firewood\nthat that young man has sent you.\"\n\"Good, but how am I to pay for the wood. I have not a penny left, dear boy. I have given\neverything, everything. I am a pauper now. Well, at least the golden gown was grand, was it not? (Ah!\nwhat pain this is!) Thanks, Christophe! God will reward you, my boy; I have nothing left now.\"\nEugene went over to Christophe and whispered in the man's ear, \"I will pay you well, and Sylvie\ntoo, for your trouble.\"\n\"My daughters told you that they were coming, didn't they, Christophe? Go again to them, and I\nwill give you five francs. Tell them that I am not feeling well, that I should like to kiss them both and see\nthem once again before I die. Tell them that, but don't alarm them more than you can help.\"\nRastignac signed to Christophe to go, and the man went.\n\"They will come before long,\" the old man went on. \"I know them so well. My tender-hearted\nDelphine! If I am going to die, she will feel it so much! And so will Nasie. I do not want to die; they will\ncry if I die; and if I die, dear Eugene, I shall not see them any more. It will be very dreary there where I\nam going. For a father it is hell to be without your children; I have served my apprenticeship already since\nthey married. My heaven was in the Rue de la Jussienne. Eugene, do you think that if I go to heaven I can\ncome back to earth, and be near them in spirit? I have heard some such things said. It is true? It is as if I\ncould see them at this moment as they used to be when we all lived in the Rue de la Jussienne. They used\nto come downstairs of a morning. 'Good-morning, papa!' they used to say, and I would take them on my\n\nknees; we had all sorts of little games of play together, and they had such pretty coaxing ways. We always\nhad breakfast together, too, every morning, and they had dinner with me--in fact, I was a father then. I\nenjoyed my children. They did not think for themselves so long as they lived in the Rue de la Jussienne;\nthey knew nothing of the world; they loved me with all their hearts. _Mon Dieu!_ why could they not\nalways be little girls? (Oh! my head! this racking pain in my head!) Ah! ah! forgive me, children, this\npain is fearful; it must be agony indeed, for you have used me to endure pain. _Mon Dieu!_ if only I held\ntheir hands in mine, I should not feel it at all.--Do you think that they are on the way? Christophe is so\nstupid; I ought to have gone myself. _He_ will see them. But you went to the ball yesterday; just tell me\nhow they looked. They did not know that I was ill, did they, or they would not have been dancing, poor\nlittle things? Oh! I must not be ill any longer. They stand too much in need of me; their fortunes are in\ndanger. And such husbands as they are bound to! I must get well! (Oh! what pain this is! what pain this\nis! . . . ah! ah!)--I must get well, you see; for they _must_ have money, and I know how to set about\nmaking some. I will go to Odessa and manufacture starch there. I am an old hand, I will make millions.\n(Oh! this is agony!)\"\nGoriot was silent for a moment; it seemed to require his whole strength to endure the pain.\n\"If they were here, I should not complain,\" he said. \"So why should I complain now?\"\nHe seemed to grow drowsy with exhaustion, and lay quietly for a long time. Christophe came\nback; and Rastignac, thinking that Goriot was asleep, allowed the man to give his story aloud.\n\"First of all, sir, I went to Madame la Comtesse,\" he said; \"but she and her husband were so busy\nthat I couldn't get to speak to her. When I insisted that I must see her, M. de Restaud came out to me\nhimself, and went on like this: 'M. Goriot is dying, is he? Very well, it is the best thing he can do. I want\nMme. de Restaud to transact some important business, when it is all finished she can go.' The gentleman\nlooked angry, I thought. I was just going away when Mme. de Restaud came out into an ante-chamber\nthrough a door that I did not notice, and said, 'Christophe, tell my father that my husband wants me to\ndiscuss some matters with him, and I cannot leave the house, the life or death of my children is at stake;\nbut as soon as it is over, I will come.' As for Madame la Baronne, that is another story! I could not speak\nto her either, and I did not even see her. Her waiting-woman said, 'Ah yes, but madame only came back\nfrom a ball at a quarter to five this morning; she is asleep now, and if I wake her before mid-day she will\nbe cross. As soon as she rings, I will go and tell her that her father is worse. It will be time enough then to\ntell her bad news!' I begged and I prayed, but, there! it was no good. Then I asked for M. le Baron, but he\nwas out.\"\n\"To think that neither of his daughters should come!\" exclaimed Rastignac. \"I will write to them\nboth.\"\n\"Neither of them!\" cried the old man, sitting upright in bed. \"They are busy, they are asleep, they\nwill not come! I knew that they would not. Not until you are dying do you know your children. . . . Oh!\nmy friend, do not marry; do not have children! You give them life; they give you your deathblow. You\nbring them into the world, and they send you out of it. No, they will not come. I have known that these\nten years. Sometimes I have told myself so, but I did not dare to believe it.\"\nThe tears gathered and stood without overflowing the red sockets.\n\"Ah! if I were rich still, if I had kept my money, if I had not given all to them, they would be with\nme now; they would fawn on me and cover my cheeks with their kisses! I should be living in a great\n\nmansion; I should have grand apartments and servants and a fire in my room; and _they_ would be about\nme all in tears, and their husbands and their children. I should have had all that; now--I have nothing.\nMoney brings everything to you; even your daughters. My money. Oh! where is my money? If I had\nplenty of money to leave behind me, they would nurse me and tend me; I should hear their voices, I\nshould see their faces. Ah, God! who knows? They both of them have hearts of stone. I loved them too\nmuch; it was not likely that they should love me. A father ought always to be rich; he ought to keep his\nchildren well in hand, like unruly horses. I have gone down on my knees to them. Wretches! this is the\ncrowning act that brings the last ten years to a proper close. If you but knew how much they made of me\njust after they were married. (Oh! this is cruel torture!) I had just given them each eight hundred thousand\nfrancs; they were bound to be civil to me after that, and their husbands too were civil. I used to go to their\nhouses: it was 'My kind father' here, 'My dear father' there. There was always a place for me at their\ntables. I used to dine with their husbands now and then, and they were very respectful to me. I was still\nworth something, they thought. How should they know? I had not said anything about my affairs. It is\nworth while to be civil to a man who has given his daughters eight hundred thousand francs apiece; and\nthey showed me every attention then--but it was all for my money. Grand people are not great. I found\nthat out by experience! I went to the theatre with them in their carriage; I might stay as long as I cared to\nstay at their evening parties. In fact, they acknowledged me their father; publicly they owned that they\nwere my daughters. But I was always a shrewd one, you see, and nothing was lost upon me. Everything\nwent straight to the mark and pierced my heart. I saw quite well that it was all sham and pretence, but\nthere is no help for such things as these. I felt less at my ease at their dinner-table than I did downstairs\nhere. I had nothing to say for myself. So these grand folks would ask in my son-in-law's ear, 'Who may\nthat gentleman be?' --'The father-in-law with the money bags; he is very rich.'--'The devil, he is!' they\nwould say, and look again at me with the respect due to my money. Well, if I was in the way sometimes, I\npaid dearly for my mistakes. And besides, who is perfect? (My head is one sore!) Dear Monsieur Eugene,\nI am suffering so now, that a man might die of the pain; but it is nothing to be compared with the pain I\nendured when Anastasie made me feel, for the first time, that I had said something stupid. She looked at\nme, and that glance of hers opened all my veins. I used to want to know everything, to be learned; and\none thing I did learn thoroughly--I knew that I was not wanted here on earth.\n\"The next day I went to Delphine for comfort, and what should I do there but make some stupid\nblunder that made her angry with me. I was like one driven out of his senses. For a week I did not know\nwhat to do; I did not dare to go to see them for fear they should reproach me. And that was how they both\nturned me out of the house.\n\"Oh God! Thou knowest all the misery and anguish that I have endured; Thou hast counted all the\nwounds that have been dealt to me in these years that have aged and changed me and whitened my hair\nand drained my life; why dost Thou make me to suffer so to-day? Have I not more than expiated the sin\nof loving them too much? They themselves have been the instruments of vengeance; they have tortured\nme for my sin of affection.\n\"Ah, well! fathers know no better; I loved them so; I went back to them as a gambler goes to the\ngaming table. This love was my vice, you see, my mistress--they were everything in the world to me.\nThey were always wanting something or other, dresses and ornaments, and what not; their maids used to\ntell me what they wanted, and I used to give them the things for the sake of the welcome that they bought\nfor me. But, at the same time, they used to give me little lectures on my behavior in society; they began\nabout it at once. Then they began to feel ashamed of me. That is what comes of having your children well\nbrought up. I could not go to school again at my time of life. (This pain is fearful! _Mon Dieu!_ These\ndoctors! these doctors! If they would open my head, it would give me some relief!) Oh, my daughters, my\ndaughters! Anastasie! Delphine! If I could only see them! Send for the police, and make them come to\n\nme! Justice is on my side, the whole world is on my side, I have natural rights, and the law with me. I\nprotest! The country will go to ruin if a father's rights are trampled under foot. That is easy to see. The\nwhole world turns on fatherly love; fatherly love is the foundation of society; it will crumble into ruin\nwhen children do not love their fathers. Oh! if I could only see them, and hear them, no matter what they\nsaid; if I could simply hear their voices, it would soothe the pain. Delphine! Delphine most of all. But tell\nthem when they come not to look so coldly at me as they do. Oh! my friend, my good Monsieur Eugene,\nyou do not know that it is when all the golden light in a glance suddenly turns to a leaden gray. It has\nbeen one long winter here since the light in their eyes shone no more for me. I have had nothing but\ndisappointments to devour. Disappointment has been my daily bread; I have lived on humiliation and\ninsults. I have swallowed down all the affronts for which they sold me my poor stealthy little moments of\njoy; for I love them so! Think of it! a father hiding himself to get a glimpse of his children! I have given\nall my life to them, and to-day they will not give me one hour! I am hungering and thirsting for them, my\nheart is burning in me, but they will not come to bring relief in the agony, for I am dying now, I feel that\nthis is death. Do they not know what it means to trample on a father's corpse? There is a God in heaven\nwho avenges us fathers whether we will or no.\n\"Oh! they will come! Come to me, darlings, and give me one more kiss; one last kiss, the\nViaticum for your father, who will pray God for you in heaven. I will tell Him that you have been good\nchildren to your father, and plead your cause with God! After all, it is not their fault. I tell you they are\ninnocent, my friend. Tell every one that it is not their fault, and no one need be distressed on my account.\nIt is all my own fault, I taught them to trample upon me. I loved to have it so. It is no one's affair but\nmine; man's justice and God's justice have nothing to do in it. God would be unjust if He condemned\nthem for anything they may have done to me. I did not behave to them properly; I was stupid enough to\nresign my rights. I would have humbled myself in the dust for them. What could you expect? The most\nbeautiful nature, the noblest soul, would have been spoiled by such indulgence. I am a wretch, I am justly\npunished. I, and I only, am to blame for all their sins; I spoiled them. To-day they are as eager for\npleasure as they used to be for sugar-plums. When they were little girls I indulged them in every whim.\nThey had a carriage of their own when they were fifteen. They have never been crossed. I am guilty, and\nnot they--but I sinned through love.\n\"My heart would open at the sound of their voices. I can hear them; they are coming. Yes! yes!\nthey are coming. The law demands that they should be present at their father's deathbed; the law is on my\nside. It would only cost them the hire of a cab. I would pay that. Write to them, tell them that I have\nmillions to leave to them! On my word of honor, yes. I am going to manufacture Italian paste foods at\nOdessa. I understand the trade. There are millions to be made in it. Nobody has thought of the scheme as\nyet. You see, there will be no waste, no damage in transit, as there always is with wheat and flour. Hey!\nhey! and starch too; there are millions to be made in the starch trade! You will not be telling a lie.\nMillions, tell them; and even if they really come because they covet the money, I would rather let them\ndeceive me; and I shall see them in any case. I want my children! I gave them life; they are mine, mine!\"\nand he sat upright. The head thus raised, with its scanty white hair, seemed to Eugene like a threat; every\nline that could still speak spoke of menace.\n\"There, there, dear father,\" said Eugene, \"lie down again; I will write to them at once. As soon as\nBianchon comes back I will go for them myself, if they do not come before.\"\n\"If they do not come?\" repeated the old man, sobbing. \"Why, I shall be dead before then; I shall\ndie in a fit of rage, of rage! Anger is getting the better of me. I can see my whole life at this minute. I have\nbeen cheated! They do not love me--they have never loved me all their lives! It is all clear to me. They\nhave not come, and they will not come. The longer they put off their coming, the less they are likely to\n\ngive me this joy. I know them. They have never cared to guess my disappointments, my sorrows, my\nwants; they never cared to know my life; they will have no presentiment of my death; they do not even\nknow the secret of my tenderness for them. Yes, I see it all now. I have laid my heart open so often, that\nthey take everything I do for them as a matter of course. They might have asked me for the very eyes out\nof my head and I would have bidden them to pluck them out. They think that all fathers are like theirs.\nYou should always make your value felt. Their own children will avenge me. Why, for their own sakes\nthey should come to me! Make them understand that they are laying up retribution for their own\ndeathbeds. All crimes are summed up in this one. . . . Go to them; just tell them that if they stay away it\nwill be parricide! There is enough laid to their charge already without adding that to the list. Cry aloud as\nI do now, 'Nasie! Delphine! here! Come to your father; the father who has been so kind to you is lying\nill!'--Not a sound; no one comes! Then am I do die like a dog? This is to be my reward--I am forsaken at\nthe last. They are wicked, heartless women; curses on them, I loathe them. I shall rise at night from my\ngrave to curse them again; for, after all, my friends, have I done wrong? They are behaving very badly to\nme, eh? . . . What am I saying? Did you not tell me just now that Delphine is in the room? She is more\ntender-hearted than her sister. . . . Eugene, you are my son, you know. You will love her; be a father to\nher! Her sister is very unhappy. And there are their fortunes! Ah, God! I am dying, this anguish is almost\nmore than I can bear! Cut off my head; leave me nothing but my heart.\"\n\"Christophe!\" shouted Eugene, alarmed by the way in which the old man moaned, and by his\ncries, \"go for M. Bianchon, and send a cab here for me.--I am going to fetch them, dear father; I will bring\nthem back to you.\"\n\"Make them come! Compel them to come! Call out the Guard, the military, anything and\neverything, but make them come!\" He looked at Eugene, and a last gleam of intelligence shone in his\neyes. \"Go to the authorities, to the Public Prosecutor, let them bring them here; come they shall!\"\n\"But you have cursed them.\"\n\"Who said that!\" said the old man in dull amazement. \"You know quite well that I love them, I\nadore them! I shall be quite well again if I can see them. . . . Go for them, my good neighbor, my dear\nboy, you are kind-hearted; I wish I could repay you for your kindness, but I have nothing to give you\nnow, save the blessing of a dying man. Ah! if I could only see Delphine, to tell her to pay my debt to you.\nIf the other cannot come, bring Delphine to me at any rate. Tell her that unless she comes, you will not\nlove her any more. She is so fond of you that she will come to me then. Give me something to drink!\nThere is a fire in my bowels. Press something against my forehead! If my daughters would lay their hands\nthere, I think I should get better. . . . _Mon Dieu!_ who will recover their money for them when I am\ngone? . . . I will manufacture vermicelli out in Odessa; I will go to Odessa for their sakes.\"\n\"Here is something to drink,\" said Eugene, supporting the dying man on his left arm, while he\nheld a cup of tisane to Goriot's lips.\n\"How you must love your own father and mother!\" said the old man, and grasped the student's\nhand in both of his. It was a feeble, trembling grasp. \"I am going to die; I shall die without seeing my\ndaughters; do you understand? To be always thirsting, and never to drink; that has been my life for the\nlast ten years. . . . I have no daughters, my sons-in-law killed them. No, since their marriages they have\nbeen dead to me. Fathers should petition the Chambers to pass a law against marriage. If you love your\ndaughters, do not let them marry. A son-in-law is a rascal who poisons a girl's mind and contaminates her\nwhole nature. Let us have no more marriages! It robs us of our daughters; we are left alone upon our\ndeathbeds, and they are not with us then. They ought to pass a law for dying fathers. This is awful! It cries\n\nfor vengeance! They cannot come, because my sons-in-law forbid them! . . . Kill them! . . . Restaud and\nthe Alsatian, kill them both! They have murdered me between them! . . . Death or my daughters! . . . Ah!\nit is too late, I am dying, and they are not here! . . . Dying without them! . . . Nasie! Fifine! Why do you\nnot come to me? Your papa is going----\"\n\"Dear Father Goriot, calm yourself. There, there, lie quietly and rest; don't worry yourself, don't\nthink.\"\n\"I shall not see them. Oh! the agony of it!\"\n\"You _shall_ see them.\"\n\"Really?\" cried the old man, still wandering. \"Oh! shall I see them; I shall see them and hear their\nvoices. I shall die happy. Ah! well, after all, I do not wish to live; I cannot stand this much longer; this\npain that grows worse and worse. But, oh! to see them, to touch their dresses--ah! nothing but their\ndresses, that is very little; still, to feel something that belongs to them. Let me touch their hair with my\nfingers . . . their hair . . .\"\nHis head fell back on the pillow, as if a sudden heavy blow had struck him down, but his hands\ngroped feebly over the quilt, as if to find his daughters' hair.\n\"My blessing on them . . .\" he said, making an effort, \"my blessing . . .\"\nHis voice died away. Just at that moment Bianchon came into the room.\n\"I met Christophe,\" he said; \"he is gone for your cab.\"\nThen he looked at the patient, and raised the closed eyelids with his fingers. The two students saw\nhow dead and lustreless the eyes beneath had grown.\n\"He will not get over this, I am sure,\" said Bianchon. He felt the old man's pulse, and laid a hand\nover his heart.\n\"The machinery works still; more is the pity, in his state it would be better for him to die.\"\n\"Ah! my word, it would!\"\n\"What is the matter with you? You are as pale as death.\"\n\"Dear fellow, the moans and cries that I have just heard. . . . There is a God! Ah! yes, yes, there is\na God, and He has made a better world for us, or this world of ours would be a nightmare. I could have\ncried like a child; but this is too tragical, and I am sick at heart.\n\"We want a lot of things, you know; and where is the money to come from?\"\nRastignac took out his watch.\n\"There, be quick and pawn it. I do not want to stop on the way to the Rue du Helder; there is not a\nmoment to lose, I am afraid, and I must wait here till Christophe comes back. I have not a farthing; I shall\n\nhave to pay the cabman when I get home again.\"\nRastignac rushed down the stairs, and drove off to the Rue du Helder. The awful scene through\nwhich he had just passed quickened his imagination, and he grew fiercely indignant. He reached Mme. de\nRestaud's house only to be told by the servant that his mistress could see no one.\n\"But I have brought a message from her father, who is dying,\" Rastignac told the man.\n\"The Count has given us the strictest orders, sir----\"\n\"If it is M. de Restaud who has given the orders, tell him that his father-in-law is dying, and that I\nam here, and must speak with him at once.\"\nThe man went out.\nEugene waited for a long while. \"Perhaps her father is dying at this moment,\" he thought.\nThen the man came back, and Eugene followed him to the little drawing-room. M. de Restaud\nwas standing before the fireless grate, and did not ask his visitor to seat himself.\n\"Monsieur le Comte,\" said Rastignac, \"M. Goriot, your father-in-law, is lying at the point of\ndeath in a squalid den in the Latin Quarter. He has not a penny to pay for firewood; he is expected to die\nat any moment, and keeps calling for his daughter----\"\n\"I feel very little affection for M. Goriot, sir, as you probably are aware,\" the Count answered\ncoolly. \"His character has been compromised in connection with Mme. de Restaud; he is the author of the\nmisfortunes that have embittered my life and troubled my peace of mind. It is a matter of perfect\nindifference to me if he lives or dies. Now you know my feelings with regard to him. Public opinion may\nblame me, but I care nothing for public opinion. Just now I have other and much more important matters\nto think about than the things that fools and chatterers may say about me. As for Mme. de Restaud, she\ncannot leave the house; she is in no condition to do so. And, besides, I shall not allow her to leave it. Tell\nher father that as soon as she has done her duty by her husband and child she shall go to see him. If she\nhas any love for her father, she can be free to go to him, if she chooses, in a few seconds; it lies entirely\nwith her----\"\n\"Monsieur le Comte, it is no business of mine to criticise your conduct; you can do as you please\nwith your wife, but may I count upon your keeping your word with me? Well, then, promise me to tell her\nthat her father has not twenty-four hours to live; that he looks in vain for her, and has cursed her already\nas he lies on his deathbed, --that is all I ask.\"\n\"You can tell her yourself,\" the Count answered, impressed by the thrill of indignation in\nEugene's voice.\nThe Count led the way to the room where his wife usually sat. She was drowned in tears, and lay\ncrouching in the depths of an armchair, as if she were tired of life and longed to die. It was piteous to see\nher. Before venturing to look at Rastignac, she glanced at her husband in evident and abject terror that\nspoke of complete prostration of body and mind; she seemed crushed by a tyranny both mental and\nphysical. The Count jerked his head towards her; she construed this as a permission to speak.\n\n\"I heard all that you said, monsieur. Tell my father that if he knew all he would forgive me. . . . I\ndid not think there was such torture in the world as this; it is more than I can endure, monsieur!--But I\nwill not give way as long as I live,\" she said, turning to her husband. \"I am a mother.--Tell my father that\nI have never sinned against him in spite of appearances!\" she cried aloud in her despair.\nEugene bowed to the husband and wife; he guessed the meaning of the scene, and that this was a\nterrible crisis in the Countess' life. M. de Restaud's manner had told him that his errand was a fruitless\none; he saw that Anastasie had no longer any liberty of action. He came away mazed and bewildered, and\nhurried to Mme. de Nucingen. Delphine was in bed.\n\"Poor dear Eugene, I am ill,\" she said. \"I caught cold after the ball, and I am afraid of pneumonia.\nI am waiting for the doctor to come.\"\n\"If you were at death's door,\" Eugene broke in, \"you must be carried somehow to your father. He\nis calling for you. If you could hear the faintest of those cries, you would not feel ill any longer.\"\n\"Eugene, I dare say my father is not quite so ill as you say; but I cannot bear to do anything that\nyou do not approve, so I will do just as you wish. As for _him_, he would die of grief I know if I went out\nto see him and brought on a dangerous illness. Well, I will go as soon as I have seen the doctor.--Ah!\" she\ncried out, \"you are not wearing your watch, how is that?\"\nEugene reddened.\n\"Eugene, Eugene! if you have sold it already or lost it. . . . Oh! it would be very wrong of you!\"\nThe student bent over Delphine and said in her ear, \"Do you want to know? Very well, then, you\nshall know. Your father has nothing left to pay for the shroud that they will lay him in this evening. Your\nwatch has been pawned, for I had nothing either.\"\nDelphine sprang out of bed, ran to her desk, and took out her purse. She gave it to Eugene, and\nrang the bell, crying:\n\"I will go, I will go at once, Eugene. Leave me, I will dress. Why, I should be an unnatural\ndaughter! Go back; I will be there before you. --Therese,\" she called to the waiting-woman, \"ask M. de\nNucingen to come upstairs at once and speak to me.\"\nEugene was almost happy when he reached the Rue Nueve-Sainte-Genevieve; he was so glad to\nbring the news to the dying man that one of his daughters was coming. He fumbled in Delphine's purse\nfor money, so as to dismiss the cab at once; and discovered that the young, beautiful, and wealthy woman\nof fashion had only seventy francs in her private purse. He climbed the stairs and found Bianchon\nsupporting Goriot, while the house surgeon from the hospital was applying moxas to the patient's\nback--under the direction of the physician, it was the last expedient of science, and it was tried in vain.\n\"Can you feel them?\" asked the physician. But Goriot had caught sight of Rastignac, and\nanswered, \"They are coming, are they not?\"\n\"There is hope yet,\" said the surgeon; \"he can speak.\"\n\"Yes,\" said Eugene, \"Delphine is coming.\"\n\n\"Oh! that is nothing!\" said Bianchon; \"he has been talking about his daughters all the time. He\ncalls for them as a man impaled calls for water, they say----\"\n\"We may as well give up,\" said the physician, addressing the surgeon. \"Nothing more can be\ndone now; the case is hopeless.\"\nBianchon and the house surgeon stretched the dying man out again on his loathsome bed.\n\"But the sheets ought to be changed,\" added the physician. \"Even if there is no hope left,\nsomething is due to human nature. I shall come back again, Bianchon,\" he said, turning to the medical\nstudent. \"If he complains again, rub some laudanum over the diaphragm.\"\nHe went, and the house surgeon went with him.\n\"Come, Eugene, pluck up heart, my boy,\" said Bianchon, as soon as they were alone; \"we must\nset about changing his sheets, and put him into a clean shirt. Go and tell Sylvie to bring some sheets and\ncome and help us to make the bed.\"\nEugene went downstairs, and found Mme. Vauquer engaged in setting the table; Sylvie was\nhelping her. Eugene had scarcely opened his mouth before the widow walked up to him with the\nacidulous sweet smile of a cautious shopkeeper who is anxious neither to lose money nor to offend a\ncustomer.\n\"My dear Monsieur Eugene,\" she said, when he had spoken, \"you know quite as well as I do that\nFather Goriot has not a brass farthing left. If you give out clean linen for a man who is just going to turn\nup his eyes, you are not likely to see your sheets again, for one is sure to be wanted to wrap him in. Now,\nyou owe me a hundred and forty-four francs as it is, add forty francs for the pair of sheets, and then there\nare several little things, besides the candle that Sylvie will give you; altogether it will all mount up to at\nleast two hundred francs, which is more than a poor widow like me can afford to lose. Lord! now,\nMonsieur Eugene, look at it fairly. I have lost quite enough in these five days since this run of ill-luck set\nin for me. I would rather than ten crowns that the old gentlemen had moved out as you said. It sets the\nother lodgers against the house. It would not take much to make me send him to the workhouse. In short,\njust put yourself in my place. I have to think of my establishment first, for I have my own living to make.\"\nEugene hurried up to Goriot's room.\n\"Bianchon,\" he cried, \"the money for the watch?\"\n\"There it is on the table, or the three hundred and sixty odd francs that are left of it. I paid up all\nthe old scores out of it before they let me have the things. The pawn ticket lies there under the money.\"\nRastignac hurried downstairs.\n\"Here, madame\" he said in disgust, \"let us square accounts. M. Goriot will not stay much longer\nin your house, nor shall I----\"\n\"Yes, he will go out feet foremost, poor old gentleman,\" she said, counting the francs with a\nhalf-facetious, half-lugubrious expression.\n\n\"Let us get this over,\" said Rastignac.\n\"Sylvie, look out some sheets, and go upstairs to help the gentlemen.\"\n\"You won't forget Sylvie,\" said Mme. Vauquer in Eugene's ear; \"she has been sitting up these two\nnights.\"\nAs soon as Eugene's back was turned, the old woman hurried after her handmaid.\n\"Take the sheets that have had the sides turned into the middle, number 7. Lord! they are plenty\ngood enough for a corpse,\" she said in Sylvie's ear.\nEugene, by this time, was part of the way upstairs, and did not overhear the elderly economist.\n\"Quick,\" said Bianchon, \"let us change his shirt. Hold him upright.\"\nEugene went to the head of the bed and supported the dying man, while Bianchon drew off his\nshirt; and then Goriot made a movement as if he tried to clutch something to his breast, uttering a low\ninarticulate moaning the while, like some dumb animal in mortal pain.\n\"Ah! yes!\" cried Bianchon. \"It is the little locket and the chain made of hair that he wants; we\ntook it off a while ago when we put the blisters on him. Poor fellow! he must have it again. There it lies\non the chimney-piece.\"\nEugene went to the chimney-piece and found the little plait of faded golden hair--Mme. Goriot's\nhair, no doubt. He read the name on the little round locket, ANASTASIE on the one side, DELPHINE on\nthe other. It was the symbol of his own heart that the father always wore on his breast. The curls of hair\ninside the locket were so fine and soft that is was plain they had been taken from two childish heads.\nWhen the old man felt the locket once more, his chest heaved with a long deep sigh of satisfaction, like a\ngroan. It was something terrible to see, for it seemed as if the last quiver of the nerves were laid bare to\ntheir eyes, the last communication of sense to the mysterious point within whence our sympathies come\nand whither they go. A delirious joy lighted up the distorted face. The terrific and vivid force of the\nfeeling that had survived the power of thought made such an impression on the students, that the dying\nman felt their hot tears falling on him, and gave a shrill cry of delight.\n\"Nasie! Fifine!\"\n\"There is life in him yet,\" said Bianchon.\n\"What does he go on living for?\" said Sylvie.\n\"To suffer,\" answered Rastignac.\nBianchon made a sign to his friend to follow his example, knelt down and pressed his arms under\nthe sick man, and Rastignac on the other side did the same, so that Sylvie, standing in readiness, might\ndraw the sheet from beneath and replace it with the one that she had brought. Those tears, no doubt, had\nmisled Goriot; for he gathered up all his remaining strength in a last effort, stretched out his hands,\ngroped for the students' heads, and as his fingers caught convulsively at their hair, they heard a faint\nwhisper:\n\n\"Ah! my angels!\"\nTwo words, two inarticulate murmurs, shaped into words by the soul which fled forth with them\nas they left his lips.\n\"Poor dear!\" cried Sylvie, melted by that exclamation; the expression of the great love raised for\nthe last time to a sublime height by that most ghastly and involuntary of lies.\nThe father's last breath must have been a sigh of joy, and in that sigh his whole life was summed\nup; he was cheated even at the last. They laid Father Goriot upon his wretched bed with reverent hands.\nThenceforward there was no expression on his face, only the painful traces of the struggle between life\nand death that was going on in the machine; for that kind of cerebral consciousness that distinguishes\nbetween pleasure and pain in a human being was extinguished; it was only a question of time--and the\nmechanism itself would be destroyed.\n\"He will lie like this for several hours, and die so quietly at last, that we shall not know when he\ngoes; there will be no rattle in the throat. The brain must be completely suffused.\"\nAs he spoke there was a footstep on the staircase, and a young woman hastened up, panting for\nbreath.\n\"She has come too late,\" said Rastignac.\nBut it was not Delphine; it was Therese, her waiting-woman, who stood in the doorway.\n\"Monsieur Eugene,\" she said, \"monsieur and madame have had a terrible scene about some\nmoney that Madame (poor thing!) wanted for her father. She fainted, and the doctor came, and she had to\nbe bled, calling out all the while, 'My father is dying; I want to see papa!' It was heartbreaking to hear\nher----\"\n\"That will do, Therese. If she came now, it would be trouble thrown away. M. Goriot cannot\nrecognize any one now.\"\n\"Poor, dear gentleman, is he as bad at that?\" said Therese.\n\"You don't want me now, I must go and look after my dinner; it is half-past four,\" remarked\nSylvie. The next instant she all but collided with Mme. de Restaud on the landing outside.\nThere was something awful and appalling in the sudden apparition of the Countess. She saw the\nbed of death by the dim light of the single candle, and her tears flowed at the sight of her father's passive\nfeatures, from which the life had almost ebbed. Bianchon with thoughtful tact left the room.\n\"I could not escape soon enough,\" she said to Rastignac.\nThe student bowed sadly in reply. Mme. de Restaud took her father's hand and kissed it.\n\"Forgive me, father! You used to say that my voice would call you back from the grave; ah! come\nback for one moment to bless your penitent daughter. Do you hear me? Oh! this is fearful! No one on\nearth will ever bless me henceforth; every one hates me; no one loves me but you in all the world. My\n\nown children will hate me. Take me with you, father; I will love you, I will take care of you. He does not\nhear me . . . I am mad . . .\"\nShe fell on her knees, and gazed wildly at the human wreck before her.\n\"My cup of misery is full,\" she said, turning her eyes upon Eugene. \"M. de Trailles has fled,\nleaving enormous debts behind him, and I have found out that he was deceiving me. My husband will\nnever forgive me, and I have left my fortune in his hands. I have lost all my illusions. Alas! I have\nforsaken the one heart that loved me (she pointed to her father as she spoke), and for whom? I have held\nhis kindness cheap, and slighted his affection; many and many a time I have given him pain, ungrateful\nwretch that I am!\"\n\"He knew it,\" said Rastignac.\nJust then Goriot's eyelids unclosed; it was only a muscular contraction, but the Countess' sudden\nstart of reviving hope was no less dreadful than the dying eyes.\n\"Is it possible that he can hear me?\" cried the Countess. \"No,\" she answered herself, and sat down\nbeside the bed. As Mme. de Restaud seemed to wish to sit by her father, Eugene went down to take a little\nfood. The boarders were already assembled.\n\"Well,\" remarked the painter, as he joined them, \"it seems that there is to be a death-orama\nupstairs.\"\n\"Charles, I think you might find something less painful to joke about,\" said Eugene.\n\"So we may not laugh here?\" returned the painter. \"What harm does it do? Bianchon said that the\nold man was quite insensible.\"\n\"Well, then,\" said the _employe_ from the Museum, \"he will die as he has lived.\"\n\"My father is dead!\" shrieked the Countess.\nThe terrible cry brought Sylvie, Rastignac, and Bianchon; Mme. de Restaud had fainted away.\nWhen she recovered they carried her downstairs, and put her into the cab that stood waiting at the door.\nEugene sent Therese with her, and bade the maid take the Countess to Mme. de Nucingen.\nBianchon came down to them.\n\"Yes, he is dead,\" he said.\n\"Come, sit down to dinner, gentlemen,\" said Mme. Vauquer, \"or the soup will be cold.\"\nThe two students sat down together.\n\"What is the next thing to be done?\" Eugene asked of Bianchon.\n\"I have closed his eyes and composed his limbs,\" said Bianchon. \"When the certificate has been\nofficially registered at the Mayor's office, we will sew him in his winding sheet and bury him somewhere.\n\nWhat do you think we ought to do?\"\n\"He will not smell at his bread like this any more,\" said the painter, mimicking the old man's little\ntrick.\n\"Oh, hang it all!\" cried the tutor, \"let Father Goriot drop, and let us have something else for a\nchange. He is a standing dish, and we have had him with every sauce this hour or more. It is one of the\nprivileges of the good city of Paris that anybody may be born, or live, or die there without attracting any\nattention whatsoever. Let us profit by the advantages of civilization. There are fifty or sixty deaths every\nday; if you have a mind to do it, you can sit down at any time and wail over whole hecatombs of dead in\nParis. Father Goriot has gone off the hooks, has he? So much the better for him. If you venerate his\nmemory, keep it to yourselves, and let the rest of us feed in peace.\"\n\"Oh, to be sure,\" said the widow, \"it is all the better for him that he is dead. It looks as though he\nhad had trouble enough, poor soul, while he was alive.\"\nAnd this was all the funeral oration delivered over him who had been for Eugene the type and\nembodiment of Fatherhood.\nThe fifteen lodgers began to talk as usual. When Bianchon and Eugene had satisfied their hunger,\nthe rattle of spoons and forks, the boisterous conversation, the expressions on the faces that bespoke\nvarious degrees of want of feeling, gluttony, or indifference, everything about them made them shiver\nwith loathing. They went out to find a priest to watch that night with the dead. It was necessary to\nmeasure their last pious cares by the scanty sum of money that remained. Before nine o'clock that evening\nthe body was laid out on the bare sacking of the bedstead in the desolate room; a lighted candle stood on\neither side, and the priest watched at the foot. Rastignac made inquiries of this latter as to the expenses of\nthe funeral, and wrote to the Baron de Nucingen and the Comte de Restaud, entreating both gentlemen to\nauthorize their man of business to defray the charges of laying their father-in-law in the grave. He sent\nChristophe with the letters; then he went to bed, tired out, and slept.\nNext day Bianchon and Rastignac were obliged to take the certificate to the registrar themselves,\nand by twelve o'clock the formalities were completed. Two hours went by, no word came from the Count\nnor from the Baron; nobody appeared to act for them, and Rastignac had already been obliged to pay the\npriest. Sylvie asked ten francs for sewing the old man in his winding-sheet and making him ready for the\ngrave, and Eugene and Bianchon calculated that they had scarcely sufficient to pay for the funeral, if\nnothing was forthcoming from the dead man's family. So it was the medical student who laid him in a\npauper's coffin, despatched from Bianchon's hospital, whence he obtained it at a cheaper rate.\n\"Let us play those wretches a trick,\" said he. \"Go to the cemetery, buy a grave for five years at\nPere-Lachaise, and arrange with the Church and the undertaker to have a third-class funeral. If the\ndaughters and their husbands decline to repay you, you can carve this on the headstone--'_Here lies M.\nGoriot, father of the Comtesse de Restaud and the Baronne de Nucingen, interred at the expense of two\nstudents_.'\"\nEugene took part of his friend's advice, but only after he had gone in person first to M. and Mme.\nde Nucingen, and then to M. and Mme. de Restaud--a fruitless errand. He went no further than the\ndoorstep in either house. The servants had received strict orders to admit no one.\n\"Monsieur and Madame can see no visitors. They have just lost their father, and are in deep grief\n\nover their loss.\"\nEugene's Parisian experience told him that it was idle to press the point. Something clutched\nstrangely at his heart when he saw that it was impossible to reach Delphine.\n\"Sell some of your ornaments,\" he wrote hastily in the porter's room, \"so that your father may be\ndecently laid in his last resting-place.\"\nHe sealed the note, and begged the porter to give it to Therese for her mistress; but the man took\nit to the Baron de Nucingen, who flung the note into the fire. Eugene, having finished his errands,\nreturned to the lodging-house about three o'clock. In spite of himself, the tears came into his eyes. The\ncoffin, in its scanty covering of black cloth, was standing there on the pavement before the gate, on two\nchairs. A withered sprig of hyssop was soaking in the holy water bowl of silver-plated copper; there was\nnot a soul in the street, not a passer-by had stopped to sprinkle the coffin; there was not even an attempt at\na black drapery over the wicket. It was a pauper who lay there; no one made a pretence of mourning for\nhim; he had neither friends nor kindred--there was no one to follow him to the grave.\nBianchon's duties compelled him to be at the hospital, but he had left a few lines for Eugene,\ntelling his friend about the arrangements he had made for the burial service. The house student's note told\nRastignac that a mass was beyond their means, that the ordinary office for the dead was cheaper, and must\nsuffice, and that he had sent word to the undertaker by Christophe. Eugene had scarcely finished reading\nBianchon's scrawl, when he looked up and saw the little circular gold locket that contained the hair of\nGoriot's two daughters in Mme. Vauquer's hands.\n\"How dared you take it?\" he asked.\n\"Good Lord! is that to be buried along with him?\" retorted Sylvie. \"It is gold.\"\n\"Of course it shall!\" Eugene answered indignantly; \"he shall at any rate take one thing that may\nrepresent his daughters into the grave with him.\"\nWhen the hearse came, Eugene had the coffin carried into the house again, unscrewed the lid, and\nreverently laid on the old man's breast the token that recalled the days when Delphine and Anastasie were\ninnocent little maidens, before they began \"to think for themselves,\" as he had moaned out in his agony.\nRastignac and Christophe and the two undertaker's men were the only followers of the funeral.\nThe Church of Saint-Etienne du Mont was only a little distance from the Rue Nueve-Sainte-Genevieve.\nWhen the coffin had been deposited in a low, dark, little chapel, the law student looked round in vain for\nGoriot's two daughters or their husbands. Christophe was his only fellow-mourner; Christophe, who\nappeared to think it was his duty to attend the funeral of the man who had put him in the way of such\nhandsome tips. As they waited there in the chapel for the two priests, the chorister, and the beadle,\nRastignac grasped Christophe's hand. He could not utter a word just then.\n\"Yes, Monsieur Eugene,\" said Christophe, \"he was a good and worthy man, who never said one\nword louder than another; he never did any one any harm, and gave nobody any trouble.\"\nThe two priests, the chorister, and the beadle came, and said and did as much as could be\nexpected for seventy francs in an age when religion cannot afford to say prayers for nothing.\n\nThe ecclesiatics chanted a psalm, the _Libera nos_ and the _De profundis_. The whole service\nlasted about twenty minutes. There was but one mourning coach, which the priest and chorister agreed to\nshare with Eugene and Christophe.\n\"There is no one else to follow us,\" remarked the priest, \"so we may as well go quickly, and so\nsave time; it is half-past five.\"\nBut just as the coffin was put in the hearse, two empty carriages, with the armorial bearings of the\nComte de Restaud and the Baron de Nucingen, arrived and followed in the procession to Pere-Lachaise.\nAt six o'clock Goriot's coffin was lowered into the grave, his daughters' servants standing round the while.\nThe ecclesiastic recited the short prayer that the students could afford to pay for, and then both priest and\nlackeys disappeared at once. The two grave diggers flung in several spadefuls of earth, and then stopped\nand asked Rastignac for their fee. Eugene felt in vain in his pocket, and was obliged to borrow five francs\nof Christophe. This thing, so trifling in itself, gave Rastignac a terrible pang of distress. It was growing\ndusk, the damp twilight fretted his nerves; he gazed down into the grave and the tears he shed were drawn\nfrom him by the sacred emotion, a single-hearted sorrow. When such tears fall on earth, their radiance\nreaches heaven. And with that tear that fell on Father Goriot's grave, Eugene Rastignac's youth ended. He\nfolded his arms and gazed at the clouded sky; and Christophe, after a glance at him, turned and went\n--Rastignac was left alone.\nHe went a few paces further, to the highest point of the cemetery, and looked out over Paris and\nthe windings of the Seine; the lamps were beginning to shine on either side of the river. His eyes turned\nalmost eagerly to the space between the column of the Place Vendome and the cupola of the Invalides;\nthere lay the shining world that he had wished to reach. He glanced over that humming hive, seeming to\ndraw a foretaste of its honey, and said magniloquently:\n\"Henceforth there is war between us.\"\nAnd by way of throwing down the glove to Society, Rastignac went to dine with Mme. de\nNucingen."
