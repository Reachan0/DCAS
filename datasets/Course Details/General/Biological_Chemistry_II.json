      "content": "Chemistry 5.08\nSpring 2016\nRecitation Week 10, April 14-15, 2016 (Nolan)\nMetal-binding studies and dissociation constant determination\n\nUnderstanding speciation of metal ions in biological systems is a challenge and requires (i)\nidentification of metal-binding sites in peptides and proteins and (ii) determination of metal-ion\naffinities of these biomolecules. The affinity of a peptide or protein for a given metal ion is\ntypically expressed as the dissociation constant (Kd). These values are measured in vitro.\nToday's recitation will focus on various approaches and pitfalls for determining metal-ion\naffinities. Detailed mathematical treatment of complex equilibria will not be covered.\n\nOverview and reminders:\n\nMetal ion: Lewis acid\nProtein or ligand: Lewis base\n\nSome general concepts related to metal/protein interactions:\n\nIrving-Williams Series (1948) - the general stability of high-spin octahedral metal complexes\nfor the replacement of water by other ligands is:\n\nMn(II) < Fe(II) < Co(II) < Ni(II) < Cu(II) > Zn(II)\n\nThis trend is essentially independent of the ligand.\nThis sequence is only for Mn(II) through Zn(II); little data for other first-row TM\nAlthough defined for octahedral complexes, the trend is often used to describe the behavior for\n4- and 5-coordinate species.\n\nWhat are some implications?\n\nFor a given ligand, Kd for Mn(II) >> Kd for Zn(II) (etc.)\n\nIf you see values with same order of magnitude, there is likely an issue!\n\nIf a Zn(II) contamination, assume Zn(II) will bind to your site of interest!\n\nHard-Soft Acid-Base Theory -- qualitative theory to describe metal/ligand preferences\n\nMetal-Ion: hard or soft Lewis acid\nLigand: hard or soft Lewis base\n\nIn general, hard metal ions prefer hard ligands. Soft metals prefer soft bases.\n\nHard:\nSmall atomic/ionic radius, high oxidation state, not very polarizable\nEx: Oxygen donor atoms, Mn(II), Fe(III), Ca(II)\n\nsiderophores (recall NRPS, enterobactin)\n\nEF-hand domains for Ca(II) coordination (e.g. calmodulin)\n\nSoft:\nLarge atomic/ionic radius, low oxidation state, polarizable\nEx: Sulfur donor atoms, Cu(I), Cd(II), Hg(II), Ag(I), Pt(II), Pb(II)\n\nHg(II) binding to the peptide metallothionein (20 Cys residues)\n\nBorderline: In the middle\nEx: Histidine N donors, Fe(II), Co(II), Zn(II)\n\nZinc finger peptides (N2S2 coordination sphere is common)\n\nThese concepts are helpful in terms of thinking about metal/protein interactions in general terms\nand making predictions about the identity of the preferred metal ion. There are exceptions to\nthese generalizations.\n\nSome practical considerations for metal-binding studies:\n\nSome general pitfalls that occur and cause confusion in the literature:\n\n1. Inappropriate fitting of data\nPrograms will fit data, but what does the fit mean?\nDirect titrations are often inappropriately fit (see below, stoichiometric binding)\n2. Use of inappropriate buffers\nMany buffers coordinate metal ions\nMany buffers are contaminated with metal ions\n\nIt is also easy to contaminate the buffer with metal ions\nNote : the buffer concentration is often high relative to the concentration of\nprotein the buffer influences the metal speciation and equilibria!\n3. Lack of pH control during experiment or experiment done at inappropriate pH\nWhat are the pKa values of potential ligands?\nAre there pH requirements for the metal ion?\n4. Lack of accuracy with concentrations\nOf metal-ion stock solution (what is the source of the metal?)\nOf the protein (how is this concentration determined?)\nOf the competitor if employed (where did it come from? Is it pure?)\n5. Use of inappropriate concentration of protein/ligand\nThink about Kd equation\n6. Lack of temperature control (the equilibrium constant is temperature dependent!)\n\n7. Lack of effective competition in experiments\nNeglect to use competitor\nUse of inappropriate competitor\nUse of a competitor that is an appropriate one but has other problems\n\nThe competitor itself is not pure (organic contamination)\n\nThe competitor has already bound a metal (inorganic contamination)\nCollection of data before equilibrium is reached\n8. Lack of appropriate precautions to prevent peptide/protein oxidation\nCysteine ligands aerobic oxidation may result in disulfide formation\nMethionine ligands air oxidation can occur as well\n9. Lack of appropriate precautions when handling metal-ions that oxidize\nFe(II) will oxidize to Fe(III) in aerobic aqueous solutions\n10. Use of an inappropriate technique / readout\nIf at all possible, it is always best to determine a Kd value with more than one\nmethod and then ask if the values obtained are within reasonable agreement or\nnot.\n\nThe bottom line:\n1. Understanding the chemistry of the system and consideration of all possible\ncomplications before setting up a titration is very important. Optimization takes time.\n2. Be thoughtful about the method of choice!\n3. Do many titrations to sort out the affinity.\n4. Be patient and persistent!\n\nTwo general ways to determine the metal-ion affinity of a protein:\n\n1. Direct approach - look at a change in a some biophysical property\nOptical absorption (e.g. cobalt binding)\nIntrinsic fluorescence (e.g. changes in Trp emission)\nEPR spectroscopy (e.g. binding of EPR active metal like Cu(II) or Mn(II))\nNMR spectroscopy (e.g. Zn(II) binding to Zn(II) finger peptide)\n\nThis approach works well for relatively low affinity sites. Why?\n\nWhat is a relatively low affinity site?\n\nNote: many proteins bind metal ions adventitiously\nWhat amino acid side chains contribute?\n\nThis approach is not appropriate for a high-affinity site. Why?\n\nDirect titration will provide information on stoichiometry.\n\nDirect titration will only provide a limit on the Kd value.\n\n(See example below)\n\n2. Indirect approach - set up a competition between the protein and another chelator\nwith a known affinity for the metal-ion of interest; monitor an observable and fit data\nto a series of equations to determine affinity for protein of interest.\nCompete protein and colorimetric indicator for the metal of interest\nCompete protein with a ligand like EDTA or EGTA and monitor a change in some\nbiophysical property of the protein\n\nbuffers that control the concentration of free metal\n\nDirect titrations - be aware of the issue of stoichiometric binding when high-affinity complexes\nform (Figure taken from Anal. Chem. 2003, 320, 39-54).\nAnother example highlighting this same problem is shown in Figure 5 of the assigned Giedroc\nreading (simulated ITC data).\nCompetition titrations - a way to determine a Kd for a high-affinity site\n1. Compete two metals for the same protein ligand\nEx. Co(II) and Zn(II)\n2. Compete two ligands for the same metal\nEx. Protein of interest and a colorimetric indicator with known affinity for the\nmetal\nEx. Prepare a buffer that contains a chelator that allows for buffering of the free\nmetal concentration\nOther Methods for determining metal ion affinities - many possibilities\nEquilibrium dialysis\nImmunoprecipitation\nSize exclusion chromatography\nIn these cases, the amount of metal-bound form must be determined. The protein can be\nquantified (how?) and metal concentration determined.\nMethods to determine metal concentration include:\nAtomic absorption spectroscopy\nICP-MS\nA colorimetric assay (e.g. ferrozine assay for iron)\nRadioactivity\n(c) Elsevier Inc.

      "content": "Recitation 11 Introduction to MS methods\nApril 20-22 2016\nRequired reading: Seo/Carroll and Angew Chem Int Ed 2011 50 134-45 and SI.\nPaulsen et al Nat Chem Biol 8 57-64 and SI (2012) covered in recitation 12 using the\nmethods in recitation 11.\nI. Mass spectrometry of biomolecules\nProtein analyte \"Soft ionization (charged ions in gas phase without\ndestruction\"\nMass spectrometry (MS) measures the mass to charge ratios (m/z) of gas-phase ions.\nThe most commonly used MS of biomolecules utilizes so-called \"soft\" ionization\nmethods: electrospray ionization (ESI-MS) and MALDI-TOF MS (matrix-assisted\nlaser desorption/time of flight MS). Large biomolecules, such as proteins, are\npolar and thermally labile, and so are not easily vaporized and ionized by\nconventional MS methods without significant fragmentation. Note that ESI and\nMALDI utilize proton ionization, generating [M+nH]n+ or [M-nH]n- ions. Traditional\nMS methods utilize electron ionization, generating [M∙]+ species that can easily\nfragment.\nI. Electrospray ionization MS\n1. Method:\nIn ESI-MS, a solution containing the molecules of interest (in some ionized form) is\npumped through a thin capillary. At the tip, small charged droplets (each containing\nmany molecules of analytes) are sprayed into a chamber at atmospheric pressure\nand travel down a potential and pressure gradient to an analyzer.\nS.J. Gaskell, J. Mass Spectrom. 32, 677, 1997\nLarge droplets with many charged analytes become isolated, desolvated ions\nthrough a combination of two mechanisms:\n1.\nSolvent evaporation (sometimes assisted by application of a heated\ngas) from small droplets increases ion concentration.\n2.\nAs charge density within a droplet increases, it reaches a point where\nsurface tension can no longer sustain the charge anymore (the\n(c) John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

The droplets fragment into smaller droplets via a\n\"Coulombic\" explosion.\nThese two mechanisms are iterated until single gaseous ions are produced.\nSamples are usually prepared in an acidic solution to generate [M+nH]n+ ions.\nESI-MS is well suited for high-resolution analysis of a range of biomolecular masses.\nThe fact that proteins have many sites that can become positively charged means\nthat even very high molecular mass proteins will be amenable to detection by a\nmass analyzer with a m/z range of 1000-2000 Da.\n2. Mass envelopes:\nAssume that we have a protein of 10000 Da. The following m/z signals might be\ndetected:\nIonization state\nm\nm/z\n+1\n+2\n+3\n3334.3\n+4\n+5\n+6\n1667.7\n+7\n1429.6\n+8\nThis gives us a mass envelope.

For more information, see https://ocw.mit.edu/help/faq-fair-use.\n\nSince soft ionization methods like ESI and MALDI are designed not to fragment the\nparent ion, a collision induced dissociation step is added after the first MS step\n(tandem MS). This method usually involves the selection of a certain parent ion for\nfurther analysis. An inert gas is introduced into a collision chamber, and collisions\nbetween the inert gas and the selected ion lead to its decomposition into several\nproduct ions, which are then mass-analyzed.\nII. Sample preparation for proteolyzed fragments separated by Reverse phase\nHPLC (LC/MS/MS):\nOften to simplify analysis, proteins are digested into peptide fragments using a\nprotease (trypsin, pepsin in the EFGR paper that will be discussed in recitation 12)\nbefore MS analysis. The peptide fragments are amenable to high-resolution\ndetection and MS/MS sequencing. For the proteolysis step, trypsin, a serine\nprotease, is often use as it reliably cleaves adjacent to Lys and Arg residues. The\nsource of trypsin is important as it is often contaminated with other serine\nproteases such as chymotrypsin. Thus in the experimental sections of many papers\nyou will see that trypsin has been treated with the protease inhibitor TPCK (tosyl\nphenylalanyl chloromethyl-ketone shown below). This inhibitor inactivates\nchymotrypsin that would add complexity to the predicted peptide fragments.\nReversed phase HPLC (High performance liquid chromatography) is also commonly\nused to separate the resulting peptides to simplify the MS analysis. The designation\n\"reversed phase\" refers to the stationary phase being nonpolar (e.g. large\nhydrocarbons, commonly C-18 or C-8) and the mobile phase is polar. Peptides are\nseparated by their relative affinities for the stationary phase when a buffer of\nincreasing hydrophobicity is applied. Below is a typical separation of a\nproteolytically cleaved protein.\n(c) Royal Society of Chemistry. All rights reserved. This content is excluded from our Creative\nCommons license.

MALDI-TOF MS (matrix assisted laser desorption coupled to time of flight due to\nlarge mass range)\nIn the first step, the protein of interest is mixed with a matrix in solution and put on\na metal plate. The solvent evaporates leaving a co-crystallized matrix/analyte. The\nmatrix material absorbs the UV laser light and primarily the matrix is desorbed and\nionized by this event. The top 1 micron is converted into a hot plume of matrix\nclusters and nanodroplets and the analyte molecules are ionized (protonated or\nnon-protonated) in this plume. The matrix is then thought to transfer a proton to\nthe analyte thus charging them. Ions observed consist of a neutral molecule [M] and\nan added or removed ion [M+H]+, [M+Na]+ or [M-H]-. The matrix consists of\ncrystallized molecules such as sinapinic acid or 3,5-dihydroxybenzoate.\nIdentification of the best matrix is determined by trial and error, but all matrices are\nlow molecular weight and easy to vaporize. They are often acidic providing a proton\nsource. They have a strong optical absorption with a chromophore in the UV.\nIII. Focus on technology development in Angew Chem Int Ed 2011 50 134-45\nIn the papers that you have read and will read (recitation 12), we are concerned\nwith development of technology for identification and quantification of post-\ntranslational modifications (PTMs) generated inside a cell that result in a mixture of\nmodified and unmodified proteins. Specifically, we are focused on the issue of\nsulfenylation which is a reversible modification thought to play an important role in\nsignal transduction mechanisms. For technology development we will focus on a\nmodel protein glutathione peroxidase 3 (Grx3) and for analysis of PTM, the focus\nwill be on the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a tyrosine kinase, whose\n(c) Royal Society of Chemistry.

The problem inside cells is a challenging\none as there are a huge number of proteins in cells, there are many different\nmodifications, and the concentrations of the proteins can span 12 orders of\nmagnitude.\n1. Reagent to detect sulfenylated cysteine: Dimedone (Dm) and iodo-dimedone\n(I-Dm) derivatives were developed to detect sulfenic acid and unmovided thiols,\nrespectively in the protein of interest (POI).\nSulfenylation (CH2-SOH) occurs by reaction of a cysteine with H2O2. Over oxidation\nto CH2-SO2- and CH2-SO3- can occur. The last modification is irreversible. These\nmodifications will be briefly discussed in Module 7.\n2. The method of detection of PTM of modified cysteines by MS: To test the\nmethodology, a well characterized protein, Gpx3, was chosen and examined. Gpx3,\n(22,736. 8Da), has two cysteines that were mutagenized to serines (C64S, C82S)\nleaving a single cysteine (C36). This protein treated with I-Dm (Dm is 138 Da), gives\na protein of 22874.6 Da, consistent with a single modifcation. Below is the ESI-MS of\nthe unlabeled and labeled species (a, left). Note that both Dm and I-Dm give the\nsame modified protein, but the former only reacts with sulfenic acids and the latter\nwith thiols. Deuterium labeling experiments described in the required reading, offer\na way to distinguish between the two. For these reagents (Dm and I-Dm) or any\nreagent) to be useful, the reactions need to occur quantitatively in aqueous solutions\nunder mild conditions at neutral pH.\nFigure 1. ESI-LC/MS and Western blot analysis using Abs to Dm shows that iododimedone selectively\nlabels the thiol group of C36 in C64S C82S Gpx3. a) The molecular weight of mock-treated C64S C82S\nGpx3 is 22736.8 Da corresponding to intact, unmodified protein (top spectrum, left). The molecular weight\nof C64S C82S Gpx3 incubated with iododimedone is 22874.6 Da (bottom spectrum, left), corresponding to\nC64S C82S Gpx3 with a single dimedone adduct (Dm=138 Da). b) C64S C82S Gpx3 (50 M) untreated or\noxidized with H2O2 (12.5, 25, 50, or 100 M) followed by Dm (20 mM) or I-Dm (20 mM).

Total protein content was determined by an anti-His antibody (bottom panel, right). Panel\nb shows with Gpx3 that with Dm as you increase the amount of hydrogen peroxide, you increase the\namount detected with the Dm Ab and with I-Dm you decrease the amount of free cysteine.\n3. Method to quantitatively distinguish between the two types of cysteine\nmodification. An example is shown below. [D6]-Dm and unlabeled I-Dm are used as\n\"D\" minimally perturbs the reagent with respect to structure and chemical reactivity.\n[Question could I-Dm react with other\namino acid side chains such as lysine or imidazole?] The POI is then first labeled\nwith [D6]-Dm, then the excess reagent is removed, and finally the sample is treated with\nunlabeled I-Dm. The protein is proteolyzed and the peptides separated and analyzed by\nLC/MS (liquid chromatogapy/MS). Quantitation is assessed by measuring the ratio of\nthe heavy peak to the heavy + light peak (see procedure above).\nAs a control experiment the authors used glyceraldehyde 3-P dehydrogenase (GAPDH)\nthat has a cysteine that is essential for catalysis. They incubated GAPDH with hydrogen\nperoxide and the Dm and I-Dm reagents. In this case, the experiment failed because the\nsulfenic acid was further oxidized to sulfinic and sulfonic acids, before the sulfenylation\nwas complete. Dm does NOT react with these modified cysteines. Thus the ratio of\nsulfenylated protein to unmodified cysteine was not reciprocal. The reactivity of the\ncysteine with the hydrogen peroxide in the particular protein being investigated,\nthus plays plays a very important role in the outcome (data in paper).\nIV. Dm reagent for use in cells (from the Nat Chem Biol paper as an\nintroduction): For these reagents (Dm or I-Dm) to be useful inside the cell, they\nneed to have a \"handle\" (an acetylene or an azide, see cartoon below) to allow\naffinity purification of the protein of interest (POI), that is, to remove the POI away\nfrom the cellular mess to enhance sensitivity. In the Nat Chem Biol paper, the\nreagent found to be most useful was DYn-2. This reagent is membrane permeable\nso that it gets into cells. Of course you also need to worry about the length and bulk\nof the labeling arm (they tried a number of reagents in the paper) and whether this\nlinker still allows the reagent to get into the active site to label the modified cysteine.\n(c) Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. All rights reserved. This content is excluded from our\nCreative Commons license. For more information, see https://ocw.mit.edu/help/faq-fair-use.\n\nThe acetylene can react with a biotin-linker-azide via click\nchemistry to give a biotin tagged-POI that can then be purified by affinity\nchromatography with streptavidin. Alternatively, Carroll et al made dimedone\nderivatives with azide linkers, which can react with a biotin-linker-alkyne. The\nchemistry between the azide and acetylene, can be copper catalyzed. In the absence\nof copper, not useful inside the cell as it is toxic, a strained alkyne such as cycloctyne\nmay be used.\nFor a review on these methods see: Shieh and Bertozzi (2014) Org and Biomol Chem 12, 9307.\nThe data presented below is from SI Figure 4 from the Carroll Nat Chem Biol paper.\nIt again illustrates proof of concept using Gpx3 to assess modification with different\ndimedone reagents for use inside cells.\n(c) source unknown.

      "content": "ANSWER KEY\n5.08 Biological Chemistry II (Spring 2016)\nProblem Set #1\nThis problem set contains one question and two pages.\nQuestion 1:\nIn the translation module, we will discuss the role of EF-Tu in aatRNAaa delivery to the\nA-site of the ribosome. Recall from the translation overview lecture that EF-Tu is a\nGTPase. If the codon-anticodon interaction between the mRNA and aatRNA is cognate,\nthen GTP hydrolysis occurs to give GDP-bound EF-Tu and free Pi. Note that GTP\nhydrolysis by EF-Tu is slow in solution and in the absence of cognate codon/anticodon\npairing.\nBackground on GTPases:\nGTPases have several conserved structural elements surrounding the GTP-binding site.\nThese conserved structural elements include the P-loop, switch 1, and switch 2.\nP-loop: 18GXXXXGK(T/S) (X = an amino acid)\nThe P-loop is involved in binding the phosphate groups of GTP.\nSwitch 1: Residues 51-62\nNote that Thr62 binds Mg(II).\nSwitch 2: 81DXXG84 (X = an amino acid)\nNote that Asp81 is involved in H-bonding interactions.\nIn this question, you will examine the structures of EF-Tu in the GTP and GDP-bound\nforms.

What is the\nanticodon sequence of the Phe-tRNAPhe? Indicate the 5' and 3' ends, the identities\nof the nucleobases, and the positions of the nucleobases in your answer.\nThe anticodon sequence is 5'-Gm-A-A-3' (positions 34-35-36).\nB) Is there anything surprising about this anticodon sequence? If so, what is\nsurprising?\nYes, there is a little surprise. Position 34 contains a modified nucleobase (2-O\nmethylguanosine or Gm)! Its structure is given below. Recall from lecture (tRNA\noverview) that ~25% of all tRNA bases can be modified.\nC) Look at the Phe-tRNAPhe!EF-Tu!GDPNP ternary complex (1TTT). Is the\nanticodon solvent accessible?\nYes.\nD) Look at the Phe-tRNAPhe !EF-Tu !GDPNP ternary complex (1TTT). Identify\nC70 and G3 in the tRNA. Draw the H-bonding interactions and label each one\n\nwith the distance. You will need to find and use PyMOL functions/tools for\ncomputing H-bonds and bond distances to do so. Make sure that the image or\nhand drawing you provide as an answer is clear to read.\nThe H-bond lengths are 2.7, 2.7, and 2.6 Angstroms.\nE) Compare the structures given by 1EFT (GDPNP-bound EF-Tu) and 1TUI (GDP\nbound EF-Tu) and focus on the GTPase center of each. What conformational\nchanges do you see (hint: focus on switch 1 and switch 2 described above)? In\nother words, how does the conformation of EF-Tu change following GTP\nhydrolysis?\nSwitch 1 and switch 2 participate in major conformational changes associated\nwith GTP hydrolysis. In the GDPNP-bound form, the GDPNP is bound inside of\nEF-Tu. In the GDP-bound form, we see that the GDP is solvent exposed. A major\nconformational change that occurs after GTP hydrolysis is that switch 1 goes from\nan alpha-helix (1EFT, GDPNP-bound form) to a random coil (1TUI, GDP-bound\nform). Switch 2 also undergoes conformational change. Note the movement in\nThr62 (switch 1) and Asp81 (switch 2). These conformational changes result in\nopening of a \"gate\" that is necessary for GTP hydrolysis.\nMoreover, looking beyond the GTPase center, movement of switch 1 and switch 2\nresults in a 90 degree shift in domain I relative to domains II and III.\n\nF) In class, we will learn that a His residue (His84) of EF-Tu is important for\ncatalysis. Kinetic studies performed by Rodnina and co-workers revealed that\nmutation of His84 to another amino acid reduced the rate of GTP hydrolysis by\nEF-Tu on the ribosome by five orders of magnitude! Identify the relevant His\nresidue in both 1EFT and 1TUI and compare the positioning and environments of\nthese His residues. What do you see? Note: the His of interest is His85 in the PDB\nstructures.\nIn the GDPNP-bound form (1EFT, left), His84 is pointing towards the γ-phosphate of\nGDPNP. The distance between N3 of His and oxygen of phosphate is about 7.0\nAngstroms. A water molecule can fit into this distance to form hydrogen bonding with\nthe His residue and the γ-phosphate of GDPNP.\nIn contrast, in the GDP-bound form (1TUI, right), His84 is pointing away from the β\nphosphate of GDP. The distance between N3 of His and oxygen of phosphate is about\n10.5 Angstroms. At this distance, we can assume that there is no interaction between the\nHis residue and the β-phosphate.\nG) Propose a role for this His residue in catalysis.\nOne potential role for His84 in catalysis is it activates the water molecule for attack on\nthe γ-phosphate of GTP as shown below. The following figure depicting interactions in\nthe GTPase region is adapted from Rodnina and co-workers (J. Mol. Biol. 2003, 332,\n689-699).\n\nH) Draw the chemical structure of GDPNP. Why was GDPNP utilized to obtain the\ncrystal structures of the GTP-bound forms?\nGDPNP is a non-hydrolyzable GTP analog. It forms a complex with EF-Tu and aa\ntRNAss, but it cannot be hydrolyzed. Depending on the experiment and system, this\nfeature is important because it prevents background GTP hydrolysis or enzymatic GTP\nhydrolysis. Non-hydrolyzable analogs are very useful for crystallography. Sometimes it\ntakes many months for a crystal to form, and so the crystallographer does not want the\nGTP hydrolyzing while waiting for crystals of the GTP-bound form.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu\n5.08J Biological Chemistry II\nSpring 2016\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: https://ocw.mit.edu/terms"

In Module 7 on ROS, you learned that for post-translational modifications\n(PTMs) such as sulfenylation and phosphorylation to be important in regulation, the\nmodification must be reversible. Ub is another example of a PTM. Polyubiquitin (polyUb)\nsignals differ in structure and function depending on the linkage type within the polyUb\nchain. In fact, thus far, eight distinct Ub chain linkages have been identified in cells and\nthey appear to have distinct functions. While Lys48 and Lys11-linked Ub polymers target\nproteins for proteosomal degradation, Lys63- and amino terminal-Met1-linked polyUb\nregulate non-degradative functions such as activation of protein kinase cascades during\nactivation of the transcription factor NF-κB. Ub modifications are reversed by five families\nof deubiquitinases (DUBs) in human cells. Four of these five families are cysteine proteases\nwhich contain a thiol with a low pKa in their active site. As you have seen with EGFR\nstudies in the Carroll paper, kinase/phosphatase signaling can be altered by PTM by\nphosphorylation and oxidation. The data described below addresses the issue of whether\nDUBs, specifically the A20 OUT DUB proposed to be a key player in the NF-κB signaling\npathway, can be regulated by ROS.\nInitally two types of experiments were carried out on the A20 OUT domain, a truncated\nversion of the DUB containing residues 1-366. The substrates used in these experiments to\nmonitor the activity of this DUB, were diUb or triUb with different isopeptide linkages\nincluding Lys48, Lys63, or Met1-diUb.\nExperiment 1\nFigure 1. a.

Draw the structure of Lys48-diUb, focusing on the chemical linkage.\n2. DUBs are cysteine proteases.

Describe how the results given in Figure 1a\nand 1b provide information about the biology/chemistry of this DUB.\nExperiment 2. A second set of experiments was performed to determine the site of A20\nmodification by H2O2 using the methods discussed in recitation 12. The truncated A20 OUT\ndomain (shown in Figure 2a) was incubated with dimethylsulfoxide (control) or DAz-2\nduring H2O2 treatment in vitro. DAz-2 is an azide-labeled version of the dimedone probe\nyou saw in recitation. Excess probe was removed and DAz-2 modified protein was\nconjugated to a biotin tag using click chemistry.\nTo identify the site(s) of modification, A20 was subjected to MS analysis and the results are\nshown in Figure 2c. The predicted mass of sulfenylated A20 is 43452 Da.\na\nb\nFigure 2. a. Structure of the truncated-A20 with the 6 detectable cysteines (green spheres).

The reagents are removed and the reaction mixture incubated with\nbiotin conjugated to an acetylene (one example is shown below). Detection of the PTM was then carried out\nby incubation with Streptavidin-coupled horseradish peroxidase (Strep-HRP).

Explain the differences in the MS data in Figure 2c (right, middle, and left). Why are\ntheir so many peaks in each spectrum and how do these peaks together provide\nconfidence in the molecular weight of the A20? Explain the molecular basis for the\nred and black * peaks.\n6.

What conclusions can you draw about the importance of PTM in the A20 DUB from\nthese in vitro studies?\n8. What additional controls could be carried out to make you more confident in your\nmodel?\nProblem 2. One of the strategies for the chemoprevention of degenerative diseases\ninvolves upregulation of antioxidant and free radical detoxification gene products by\nincreasing intracellular concentrations of the transcription factor erythroid2-related factor\n2 (Nrf2). The proposal has been made recently that this can be done by disruption of the\ninteraction between Nrf2 and the Kelch-like ECH associated protein 1 (Keap1), a substrate\nadaptor protein for a Cul3-dependent E3 ubiquitin ligase. Under basal conditions Keap1\nrepresses Nrf2 by targeting the transcription factor for ubiquitination and degradation by\nthe proteasome. This problem is focused on a recent assay using FRET methods to find\ninhibitors of the Nrf2-Keap1 interaction.\nThe first step in the assay development was to design fluorescently labeled domains\nof both Keap1 and Nrf2. The construct design shown in Figure 3a is based on the\nidentification of a \"high affinity\" motif peptide ETGE (residues contained within a 16-mer\npeptide) of Nrf2. This Nrf2 construct also has a hexaHis tag at the N-terminus followed by a\ncyan-fluorescent protein (CFP) and is called CFP-Nrf. A TEV protease cleavage site has also\nbeen inserted in the construct (labeled TEV). The Keap construct is composed of a YFP\n(yellow fluorescent protein) conjugated to a Kelch domain and is called YFP-Kelch.\na\nb\nFigure 3 a. Schematic representation of the domains of YFP-Kelch (top) and CFP-Nrf2 (bottom). b.\nMolecular model of the YFP-Kelch and the CFP-Nrf2 FRET pair constructed from the human Keap1 Kelch\ndomain (red) with YFP (yellow) and the 16mer-Nrf2 peptide (pink) and CFP (blue) construct. The separation\nbetween the CFP and the YFP chromophore residues in the complex of these proteins was estimated to be 6\nto 8 nm, a distance suitable for this FRET pair.\n(c) The Protein Society.

Using the information from the control and experiment given in Figure 4, describe\nthe results from each titration (A and B). Fill in the missing in Figure 3B (right).\nExplain whether this data suggests that a high throughput screen monitoring FRET\nto look for inhibitors of the Nrf2-Keap1 interaction has a chance to be successful.\n2.

In Module 7 on ROS, you learned that for post-translational\nmodifications (PTMs) such as sulfenylation and phosphorylation to be important in\nregulation, the modification must be reversible. Ub is another example of a PTM.\nPolyubiquitin (polyUb) signals differ in structure and function depending on the\nlinkage type within the polyUb chain.

The data described below\naddresses the issue of whether DUBs, specifically the A20 OUT DUB proposed to be\na key player in the NF-κB signaling pathway, can be regulated by ROS.\nInitally two types of experiments were carried out on the A20 OUT domain, a\ntruncated version of the DUB containing residues 1-366. The substrates used in\nthese experiments to monitor the activity of this DUB, were diUb or triUb with\ndifferent isopeptide linkages including Lys48, Lys63, or Met1-diUb.\nExperiment 1\nFigure 1. a.

Draw the structure of Lys48-diUb, focusing on the chemical linkage. This\nproblem was taken from Nature Communications 2013 4, 1-9.\n(c) Springer Nature Limited.

DUBs are cysteine proteases. Given your understanding of the chemical\nmechanisms of peptide bond hydrolysis by cysteine proteases in general,\nwhat residues are likely involved in catalysis and what is their role?\nCysteine proteases have an active site cysteine and histidine. In general the pKa of\nthe cysteine is perturbed and the cysteine is in the thiolate form and the histidine is\nprotonated. Below is the active site of the DUB in this problem. On the far left you\ncan see the His/Cys dyad and then to the right in the Figure below, you see different\nstates of cysteine oxidation subsequent to treatment of the DUB with H2O2.\nRemember cysteine proteases are more chemically reactive relative to serine\nproteases because the cysteine is a better nucleophile (lower pKa). Thus one only\nneeds a dyad to carry out peptide bond hydrolysis through tetrahedral\nintermediates or transition states (never detected experimentally) and the covalent\nacyl-enzyme intermediate. The latter is then hydrolyzed to give product.\n3. What is the purpose of Experiment 1? Describe how the results given in\nFigure 1a and 1b provide information about the chemistry/biology of this\nDUB.\nTo carry out studies on DUBs, one first needs to establish an assay. Assay\ndevelopment requires a knowledge of the substrate and then a method to monitor\nproduct formation. To learn about substrate specificity the authors investigated the\nimportance of the linkage between the Ubs (Figure 1a). They investigated linkages\nbetween G76 (the C-terminus of Ub) to Lys48, Lys63 or the N-terminal methionine.\nThey stopped the reaction and then monitored cleavage of diUbs to monoUb using\nSDS PAGE analysis. They carried out these experiments in the presence of absence\n(c) Springer Nature Limited. Kulathu, Y. et al. \"Regulation of A20 and other OTU deubiquitinases by reversible oxidation.\"\nNat.

The results revealed that under the conditions examined only the diUb with\nthe Lys48 linkage was cleaved. They further revealed that if DUB was treated with\nDTT, presumably to reduce any oxidized active site cysteine, that the cleavage was\nmuch more efficient, relative to its absence. Thus this experiment gave them insight\nabout substrate specificity and supported the proposal that a cysteine may be\nimportant in peptide bond cleavage. In the part b, they used triUb substrates with\nLys48 linkages. The studies on the top gel (sample without any DTT) revealed that\nthe extent of cleavage to diUb and monoUb decreased as the concentration of\nH2O2 increases. This results suggests that the active site is modified and the enzyme\nbecomes inactive. When the same sample is treated with DTT, which can reduce the\nsulfenic acid of cysteine back to cysteine, then the enzyme becomes more active and\nthe cleavage to mono and diUb products is greatly increased. This data thus\nsupports a model where sulfenylation could be an important regulatory mechanism\nfor DUBs. However, the key is the kinetics of this process, its occurrence in vivo and\nthe relationship to a biological response.\nExperiment 2. A second set of experiments was performed to determine the site of\nA20 modification by H2O2 using the methods discussed in recitation 11. The\ntruncated A20 OUT domain (shown in Figure 2a) was incubated with\ndimethylsulfoxide (control) or DAz-2 during H2O2 treatment in vitro.

Structure of the truncated-A20 with the 6 detectable cysteines (green spheres). All of\nthese studies have been done in vitro. b. A20 has been treated as indicated with H2O2 (50 M for 60\nmin), DAz-2 (see structure) or DMSO (the control). The reagents are removed and the reaction\nmixture incubated with biotin conjugated to an acetylene (one example is shown below). Detection of\nthe PTM was then carried out by incubation with Streptavidin-coupled horseradish peroxidase\n(Strep-HRP). Streptavidin binds to biotin. The A20 gel below the Strep-HRP blot indicates that\nloading of A20 was the same in all lanes. c. Left, mass-spectrum of intact A20 domain without H2O2\ntreatment. Middle, untreated A20 labeled with DAz-2. Right, A20 treated with 50 M H2O2 for 1 h at\nroom temperature and then labeled with DAz-2.\nQuestions:\n4. Describe the method of detection in Figure 2b that was used to generate the\nblot labeled Strep-HRP. Show the steps involved and the chemical\ntransformations.\nIn this experiment, A20 is purified and studies are in vitro. In Figure 2b one\nobserves a small amount of dimedone labeled-A20 even in the absence of H2O2. This\nsuggests that the active site cysteine (or an allosteric site cysteine) is susceptible to\noxidation (lane 3). However, after treatment with H2O2 (50 M, 60 min) the band is\nmuch more intense. Two points: first the reaction with the oxidant is slow. In vivo\nthe concentrations of H2O2 might spike to this concentration (high effective\nmolarity), but would be rapidly reduced to less toxic levels. DAz-2 is able to access\nthe cysteine (presumably the active site) and modify it, suggesting the location of\nthe linker allows the dimedone reaction to still proceed. The observed signal\n(Figure 2b) is associated with the DAz-2 reacting with the acetylenic biotin above\nvia click chemistry that forms a stable covalent linkage. The conjugate is analyzed\nby SDS PAGE. Detection of the biotin and hence A20 occurs using the protein\nSteptavidin, which forms a tight complex with biotin. Streptavidin is conjugated to\nhorseradish peroxidase which in the presence of an oxidizable substrate such as\ndiaminobenzidine generates a polymeric brown material which is detectable.\nDigression HRP is analogous to MPO discussed in the ROS lecture 1. The substrate\nis either H2O2 or an organic peroxide (ROOH) which reacts with the Fe3+-porphryin\nto generate a Fe4+=O porphryin cation radical (compound I intermediate) which is\nhighly oxidizing. This intermediate can then be reduced back to the ground state by\ntwo successive one electron transfers via a substrate such as a phenol or\ndiaminobenzidine. The one electron oxidized species can polymerize (latter case)\nor be detected by chemiluminescence (see recitation 2/3).\nInsert a mechanism (not required but is similar to the one electron chemistry with myloperoxidase.\n\n5. Explain the differences in the MS data in Figure 2c (right, middle, and left).\nWhy are their so many peaks in each spectrum and how do these peaks\ntogether provide confidence in the molecular weight of the A20? Explain the\nmolecular basis for the red and black * peaks.\nThe MS on the far left is the wt protein. You are looking at m/z that must be in the\n1000 to 2000 da mass range for detection. From the different m/z peaks observed\nand a knowledge of the z, one can use all the information to calculate the MW of the\nprotein. When the protein is reacted with DAz-2 one now sees an additional set of\npeaks (red star). You are given that the calculated mass is 202 different from the\nunmodified protein. This suggests that some of the cysteine in the wt protein has\nbeen modified by sulfenylation already and is detected by the dimedone reagent.\nOnce the system is treated with H2O2, the extent of modification increases and is\ngreater than the unmodified protein. The mass difference is 194. This number is\nvery close to the expected mass of the protein modified with DAz-2 (195.2 da).\n6. Describe an experiment to identify the site(s) of labeling in the sample on the\nright (Figure 2c).\nTo identify the site of labeling, the dimedone-modified protein was modified further\nwith iodoacetamide to block the unreacted cysteines and prevent their oxidation\nduring workup. The protein is then digested with trypsin to generate peptides. The\npeptides can then be examined by MS/MS analysis. We know the expected\nmolecular weight of all the peptides given the protease specificity and the known\ncysteine modifications. See below but the appropriate m/z (+3) of the peptide of\ninterest was identified and then sequenced. The sequencing allowed identification\nof the acetamide modified peptide in the case of the untreated A20 and of the\ndimedone modified protein in the case of the peroxide treated proteins.\n(c) source unknown.

What conclusions can you draw about the importance of PTM in the A20 DUB\nfrom these in vitro studies?\nThe results suggest that this A20 DUB is readily sulfenylated, whether this\nmodification plays an important role in vivo requires much more extensive\ncharacterization both in vivo and in vitro.\n8. What additional controls could be carried out to make you more confident in\nyour model?\nMany experiments need to be done, this is only the beginning. One would like to\nshow that the sulfenylation occurs on the intact protein and that it occurs at a\nreasonable rate given the concentrations of the protein and of H2O2 inside the cell.\nOne would then like to figure out a biological assay in cells where a protein(s) can\nbe identified that become Ubiquitinylated and have lys48 linkages and show that\nthis specific DUB is present and alters the fate of this (these) protein (proteins).\nMuch effort needs to be expended to convince oneself that this DUB that alters the\npolyUb is important in the cell before any further experiments regarding regulation\nof this DUB are undertaken.\nProblem 2. One of the strategies for the chemoprevention of degenerative diseases\ninvolves upregulation of antioxidant and free radical detoxification gene products\nby increasing intracellular concentrations of the transcription factor erythroid2-\nrelated factor 2 (Nrf2). The proposal has been made recently that this can be done\nby disruption of the interaction between Nrf2 and the Kelch-like ECH associated\nprotein 1 (Keap1), a substrate adaptor protein for a Cul3-dependent E3 ubiquitin\nligase (see the overview slide on ROS and signaling Lecture 2). Under basal\nconditions Keap1 represses Nrf2 by targeting the transcription factor for\n(c) Springer Nature Limited.

This problem is focused on a\nrecent assay using FRET methods to find inhibitors of the Nrf2-Keap1 interaction.\nThe first step in the assay development was to design fluorescently labeled\ndomains of both Keap1 and Nrf2. The construct design shown in Figure 3a is based\non the identification of a \"high affinity\" motif peptide ETGE (residues contained\nwithin a 16-mer peptide) of Nrf2. This Nrf2 construct also has a hexaHis tag at the\nN-terminus followed by a cyan-fluorescent protein (CFP) and is called CFP-Nrf. A\nTEV protease cleavage site has also been inserted in the construct (labeled TEV).\nThe Keap construct is composed of a YFP (yellow fluorescent protein) conjugated to\na Kelch domain and is called YFP-Kelch.\na\nb\nFigure 3 a.

The solid line represents the donor alone before titration.\nQuestions:\n1. Using the information from the control and experiment given in Figure 4,\ndescribe the results from each titration (A and B). Fill in the missing in\nFigure 3B (right). Explain whether this data suggests that a high throughput\nscreen monitoring FRET to look for inhibitors of the Nrf2-Keap1 interaction\nhas a chance to be successful.\nThis data was taken from Protein Science 2013 22 1812-19. The details of the\nexperiments in this problem set and additional experiments are described. Two\ntitrations, a control with YFP alone and one conjugated to Kelch were carried out.\nAlso in the figure are displayed the emission spectra of the acceptor and donor\nfusion proteins for reference. The TEV protease is a further control as cleavage at\nthis site would result in rapid loss of FRET which does occur (data not shown). The\nefficiency of FRET is quantitifed by measuring the decrease in donor emission at\n475 nm and an increase at 527 nm. An optimum FRET efficiency (FE) was recorded\nat 0.11 M CFP-Nrf2 and 0.28 M YFP-Kelch (FE = 0.23). The FRET signal is stable\nfor 24 h important for assay development. The changes observed are reasonably\nrobust and one would expect to see a loss in fluorescence with a moderately large\nchange. If the signal is stable, then this pair could be useful in an assay.\n2. Explain why the titrations in Figure 4 should be repeated at high salt\nconcentration (ex, 150 mM NaCl) and in the presence of DMSO, a solvent\noften used to dissolve many small molecule drug candidates that are not very\nsoluble in aqueous solution.\nHigh salt (effects electrostatic interactions) and DMSO from \"inhibitor addition to\nassist solubility\" could effect interactions between this FRET pair. Thus one needs\nto optimize the FE given the exact conditions of the high though put assay, to\nmaximize the chance of finding an inhibitor of this interaction.\n3. How might the small molecule drug candidates affect similar titrations to\nthose described in Figure 4? Draw a fluorescence intensity vs graph for a\nsuccessful effect of these additives.\nThe type of control one needs to carry out is shown in Figure 5. A peptide from Nrf2\nwhich contains the ETGE motif and has a known Ki and is a competitive inhibitor,\nbased on other methods of analysis, serves as the control. What you see is an\nincrease in donor emission at 475 nm and a loss of signal at 527 nm due to\ndisruption of the interaction. One can use this change and different concentrations\nof the inhibitor to calculate a Ki. This Ki can be compared with one determined by\nother methods to establish that the assay is working as expected. If this is successful\nthen one would like to carry out experiments in a high throughput fashion were\nmany inhibitors can be assayed simultaneously. The concentrations in the screen\nare key as you want to maximize your signal, but have it disrupted with\nconcentrations of inhibitor as low as possible.\n\nOnce the setup has been optimized, one would like to adopt this methodology to a\nmultiwell plate format so that 105 small molecules can be investigated for their\nability to disrupt the CFP-Nrf2-YFP-Kelch interaction. As a prelude to such\nexperiments the investigators carried out a similar experiment in the presence or\nabsence of a decameric peptide known to inhibit the Keap1-Nrf2 interactions. The\nresults are shown in Figure 5 A and B.\nFigure 5 Fluorescence emission spectra of YFP-Kelch and CFP-Nrf2 in the absence\n(A) or the presence (B) of a 10 M unlabeled Nrf2-derived peptide inhibitor.\nShown are the emission spectra of the FRET pair (solid line), donor alone (dotted\nline), acceptor alone (long dashed line), the sum of the donor and acceptor (short-\ndashed line).\nQuestions:\n4. Explain the results shown in Figure 5.\nThe inhibitor disrupts the 475, 527 nm features see model above and preceding\nquestion.\n(c) The Protein Society.

Include and label (i) the mRNA (labeling 5' and 3' end), (ii) the three sites of\nthe PTC, and (iii) nascent polypeptide emerging from the exit tunnel in your cartoon.\nQuestion 2:\nNascent polypeptide chains must fold into native conformations, and we will address\nprotein folding in module 2. In many labs, protein folding is performed and studied in\naqueous solution, hence in the \"test tube.\" These studies provide useful information, but\nthe folding environment provided by simple aqueous buffer is very different from what\nthe polypeptide encounters in the crowded environment of the cell. Imagine forgetting the\ntest tube for folding experiments and venturing into the cell. Professor Gary Pielak's lab\n\nat University of North Carolina Chapel Hill is pioneering studies of protein folding inside\nliving cells - wow! One approach that the Pielak Lab uses is to incorporate 19F labels into\nthe protein of interest and employ 19F NMR spectroscopy to study protein folding in live\nE coli cells (see J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2010, 132, 321-327 if you are curious; you need not\nread the paper to answer this question). In these experiments, the E. coli cells produce the\n19F-labeled protein in the cytosol, and these E. coli are placed in a NMR tube and the 19F\nsignal(s) recorded.\nWhy the choice of the 19F label? In brief, 19F NMR is a useful technique because 19F is a\nspin 1⁄2 nucleus and has 100% natural abundance. The 19F nucleus gives a wide range of\nchemical shifts (400 ppm versus 13 ppm for 1H) and the chemical shifts are very sensitive\nto the local environment (consider that a fluorine nucleus is surrounded by 9 electrons\ncompared to 1 electron for a proton). Moreover, taking a 19F NMR spectrum is simple,\nvery much like recording a 1H NMR. Various fluorinated amino acids, including 3\nfluorotyrosine, have been employed in 19F NMR and in the cell-based experiments\nreported by the Pielak Lab. (Note: 19F is not a radioisotope.)\nImagine you wish to study the folding landscape of your protein of interest in living E.\ncoli cells by 19F NMR. To do so, you will have E. coli site-specifically incorporate the\nunnatural amino acid (UAA) 3-fluorotyrosine (3-FTyr) into your protein using its\nendogenous ribosome. Your protein is 100-aa in length.\nA) Draw the chemical structure of 3-fluorotyrosine.\nB) You will need an evolved tRNA/aaRS pair in order to incorporate 3-fluorotyrosine\ninto your protein. Based on class discussion, describe the essential features of this\ntRNA/aaRS pair.\nC) You perform site-directed mutagenesis to place the Amber STOP codon at various\npositions in your plasmid that harbors the gene for your 100-aa protein. In plasmid 1\n(encoding protein 1), the Amber STOP codon is at position 2 (the bp triplet encoding\nresidue 2). In plasmid 2 (encoding protein 2), the STOP codon is at position 56. In\nplasmid 3 (encoding protein 3), the STOP codon is at position 100 (C-terminal residue).\nUsing the diagram for the plasmid/protein 1 mutant as a guide, sketch the corresponding\nmRNAs that arise from transcription of the gene of interest and the full-length\npolypeptides that arise from translation for the position 56 and 100 variants.\nplasmid 1 / protein 1\n5'\n3'\nUAG\n(bp 4-6)\nN\nC\ntranslation\ngene of interest\nprotein of interest\nmRNA sequence\namino acid sequence\n3-Fyr\n(position 2)\n\nD) In class, we learned about release factor 1 (RF1). This release factor is a problem for\nUAA incorporation by the endogenous ribosome because it recognizes the Amber STOP\ncodon and hydrolyzes the peptidyl-tRNA, causing formation of truncated proteins. In\ndesigning your experiments further, you consider the potential effect of RF1 on the\nsynthesis of proteins 1-3 described above. Describe the expected outcomes for translation\nof the mRNAs encoding proteins 1-3 taking RF1 action into account.\nE) Based on your answers to C and D, what mutant protein will you select to employ in\nyour first in-cell 19F NMR experiments?

What is the\nprocess defined by k1 and k-1?\n\n(\n(\nThe molecule depicts an aminoacylated-tRNA bound to EF-Tu!GTP. It is the EF-\nTu!GTP!aatRNAaa ternary complex.\n\nThe process defined by k1 and k-1 is the initial binding process. EF-Tu!GTP!aatRNAaa\nternary complexes bind to the ribosome weakly. They are recruited by the ribosomal\nproteins L7 and L12. This step is independent of the mRNA.\n\nB) Describe the process labeled \"2.\" Provide an explanation for the forward and reverse\nreactions (k2 and k-2 ).\n\nThis step depicts the codon-anticodon recognition process, also known as decoding. The\nanticodon on the aminoacyl-tRNA should match (cognate) that of the mRNA codon in\nthe A-site of the PTC. If EF-Tu!GTP!aatRNAaa delivers the cognate tRNA to the A site,\nthen the aminoacyl-tRNA will be bound to the A site. Conformational change occurs that\nallows for GTPase activation next step, k3 ) and the EF-Tu hydrolyzes GTP to GDP and\nPi (subsequent chemical step, kGTP ). If the codon-anticodon does not match (e.g. near-\ncognate), the aminoacyl-tRNA leaves the A site k-2, reverse reaction). Note that Rodnina\nand co-workers measured these rate constants and determined that k2 (forward reaction of\nprocess labeled 2 ) is nearly invariant for all cognate and near-cognate ternary complexes.\nIn contrast, k-2 varies tremendously and is 102-103 faster for near-cognate than cognate!\nAlso note there is a peptidyl-tRNA in the P site.\n\nC) What is depicted in the ribosome cartoon shown as \"3\"\n\nPeptide bond formation occurs in cartoon 3. The growing polypeptide chain on the P-site\ntRNA is loaded onto the incoming amino acid on the A-site tRNA. The alpha amino\ngroup of the A-site aa-tRNAaa is the nucleophile (nucleophilic attack on the ester linkage\nof the P-site peptidyl-tRNA). Think about pKa values - the ribosome must have a means\nto tune the pKa of the alpha-amino group such that it is lower than we expect (R-NH2\ninstead of R-NH3\n+ ).\n\nD) In the cartoon above, what steps are important for fidelity? Why?\n\nSteps labeled as 2 and 4 are important for fidelity.\n\nStep 2 - as described above, this is the codon/anticodon recognition step. The correct or\ncognate codon/anticodon match is needed for the genetic code to be translated accurately\nand avoid incorporation of the wrong amino acid into the growing polypeptide chain. In\nthis step, the k-2 varies tremendously and is 102-103 faster for near-cognate than cognate,\nwhich allows for near-cognate to be rejected by the ribosome. In contrast, the cognate\ntRNA will remain bound.\n\nStep 4 - this step (defined by k7 ) is a final proof-reading step. It occurs after GTP\nhydrolysis by EF-Tu. If a near-cognate tRNA ended up in the A site after GTP\nhydrolysis, this proof-reading step can result in rejection of the near-cognate tRNA from\nthe A-site to maintain fidelity. Note that this proof-reading occurs at the expense of GTP.\n\nE) Consider the following tRNAs and mRNA:\n\nmRNA (codon)\ntRNAs (anticodons)\n\n5'\nA U U\n3'\ntRNA 1: 5'\nC A G\n3'\n\ntRNA 2: 5'\nC A U\n3'\n\ntRNA 3: 5'\nU C C\n3'\n\ni) Draw the codon / anticodon interactions for each mRNA / tRNA pair and indicate\nwhether the pair is a cognate, near-cognate or non-cognate match.\n\ntRNA 1: 3'\nG A C\n5'\ntRNA 2: 3'\nU A C\n5'\ntRNA 3: 3'\nC C U\n5'\n5'\nA U U\n3'\n5'\nA U U\n3'\n5'\nA U U\n3'\n\nnear-cognate\ncognate\nnon-cognate\n\nii) What is the consequence of each mRNA/tRNA pair on the process labeled \"2\"?\n\nmRNA + tRNA 1 - because it is a near-cognate pair, step 2 will proceed in the reverse\ndirection; k-2 will increase by 102-103 fold and thereby allow the near-cognate EF-\nTu!GTP!aatRNAaa to be rejected by the ribosome.\n\nmRNA + tRNA 2 - this is a cognate pair. Step 2 will proceed in the forward direction\nsuch that GTPase activation occurs.\n\nmRNA + tRNA 3 - this is a non-cognate pair. It is rejected by the ribosome.\n\niii) What is the consequence of each mRNA/tRNA pair on the process labeled \"4\"?\n\nmRNA + tRNA 1 - if the near-cognate tRNA were to remain bound to the ribosome to\nthis stage, proof-reading in step 4 would result in its rejection from the A-site.\n\nmRNA + tRNA 2 - none; proof-reading would not occur because this pair is cognate.\n\nmRNA + tRNA 3 - this is a non-cognate pair. It is rejected by the ribosome.\n\n(\n\nF) What occurs immediately after peptidyl transfer? Draw a cartoon of the ribosome in\nthis state. Include and label (i) the mRNA (labeling 5' and 3' end), (ii) the three sites of\nthe PTC, and (iii) nascent polypeptide emerging from the exit tunnel in your cartoon.\n\nTranslocation where the deacylated tRNA in the P site moves to the E site, and the\npeptidyl tRNA in the A site moves to the P site. The mRNA moves as well. Recall that\nthe \"hybrid states\" form immediately after peptide bond formation. The 3' end of the\ndeacylated tRNA enters the E site while the anticodon end remains in the P-site. The 3'\nend (with growing peptidyl chain) of the new peptidyl-tRNA enters the P-site and the\nanticodon end remains in the A-site. Subsequently, ratcheting of the ribosome occurs\n(conformational change) and EF-G is the elongation factor required for translocation.\n\nQuestion 2:\n\nNascent polypeptide chains must fold into native conformations, and we will address\nprotein folding in module 2.

Moreover, taking a 19F NMR spectrum is simple,\nvery much like recording a 1H NMR. Various fluorinated amino acids, including 3-\nfluorotyrosine, have been employed in 19F NMR and in the cell-based experiments\nreported by the Pielak Lab. Note: 19F is not a radioisotope.)\n\nImagine you wish to study the folding landscape of your protein of interest in living E.\ncoli cells by 19F NMR. To do so, you will have E. coli site-specifically incorporate the\nunnatural amino acid (UAA) 3-fluorotyrosine (3-FTyr) into your protein using its\nendogenous ribosome. Your protein is 100-aa in length.\n\nA) Draw the chemical structure of 3-fluorotyrosine.\n\nOH\n\nO\nF\n\nH3N\n\nO\n\nB) You will need an evolved or \"new\" tRNA/aaRS pair in order to incorporate 3-\nfluorotyrosine into your protein. Based on class discussion, describe the essential features\nof this tRNA/aaRS pair.\n\nBackground: The Shultz method for UAA incorporation requires a unique codon that\nuniquely designates the UAA (reassignment of the Amber STOP codon), a evolved or\n\"new\" tRNA that is is specific for the unique codon, and a corresponding aaRS that loads\nthe UAA onto the unique tRNA.\n\nThe tRNA/aaRS pair must be orthogonal to the endogenous components of E. coli. In\nother words, there cannot be cross-reactivity between the endogenous protein\nbiosynthetic machinery and the machinery introduced to allow for site-specific\nincorporation of the UAA of interest into the protein being expressed in E. coli.\n\nIn particular:\n1) The new tRNA must only translate the codon for the UAA\n2) The new tRNA cannot be a substrate for any endogenous aaRS\n3) The new aaRS must only recognize the new tRNA\n4) The new aaRS must only aminoacylate the new tRNA with the UAA\n\nAlso note that the UAA, in this case 3-fluorotyrosine, cannot be a substrate for\nendogenous aaRS. If it were a substrate and transferred to endogenous tRNAs, then 3-\nfluorotyrosine incorporation into endogenous proteins would occur (think: why would\nthis be a problem for your 19F NMR experiment? ). Lastly, another factor to keep in\nmind is that the UAA must be able to enter the cell. Based on prior work by the\nPielak Lab and others, you can assume that sufficient 3-fluorotyrosine is taken up into\nE. coli for your experiment.\n\nC) You perform site-directed mutagenesis to place the Amber STOP codon at various\npositions in your plasmid that harbors the gene for your 100-aa protein. In plasmid 1\n(encoding protein 1) , the Amber STOP codon is at position 2 (the bp triplet encoding\nresidue 2). In plasmid 2 (encoding protein 2) , the STOP codon is at position 56. In\nplasmid 3 (encoding protein 3) , the STOP codon is at position 100 (C-terminal residue).\nUsing the diagram for the plasmid/protein 1 mutant as a guide, sketch the corresponding\nmRNAs that arise from transcription of the gene of interest and the full-length\npolypeptides that arise from translation for the position 56 and 100 variants.\n\nplasmid 1 / protein 1\n\nmRNA sequence\n5'\ngene of interest\n3'\nUAG\n(bp 4-6)\ntranslation\namino acid sequence N\nprotein of interest\nC\n3-Fyr\n(position 2)\nplasmid 2 / protein 2\nmRNA sequence\n5'\ngene of interest\n3'\nUAG\n(bp 166-168)\ntranslation\namino acid sequence N\nprotein of interest\nC\n3-Fyr\n(position 56)\n\nplasmid 3 / protein 3\n\nmRNA sequence\n5'\n3'\ngene of interest\n\nUAG\n(bp 298-300)\ntranslation\n\namino acid sequence N\nprotein of interest\nC\n\n3-Fyr\n(position 100)\n\nD) In class, we learned about release factor 1 RF1 ). This release factor is a problem for\nUAA incorporation by the endogenous ribosome because it recognizes the Amber STOP\ncodon and hydrolyzes the peptidyl-tRNA, causing formation of truncated proteins. In\ndesigning your experiments further, you consider the potential effect of RF1 on the\nsynthesis of proteins 1-3 described above. Describe the expected outcomes for translation\nof the mRNAs encoding proteins 1-3 taking RF1 action into account.\nProtein 1: In this case, the UAA is at position 2 of a 100-aa protein.\n\nIf the 3FTyr-tRNACUA\n3FTyr enters the A-site, then 3FTyr will be incorporated and there\nwill be one 19F label near the N-terminus of the polypeptide chain.\n\nIf RF1 enters the A-site, translation will be terminated. There will be no synthesis of a\npolypeptide chain because only fMet-tRNAfMet will be in the A-site and RF1-cataylzed\nhydrolysis will result in release of fMet.\n\nProtein 2: In this case, the UAA is at position 56 of a 100-aa protein.\n\nIf the 3FTyr-tRNACUA\n3FTyr enters the A-site, then 3FTyr will be incorporated and there\nwill be one 19F label in the middle (position 56) of the polypeptide chain.\n\nIf RF1 enters the A-site, translation will be terminated. In this case, premature\ntermination will result in formation of a truncated polypeptide that is approximately one-\nhalf of the size (55 residues) of the full-length 100-aa peptide of interest.\nProtein 3: In this case, the UAA is at position100 of a 100-aa protein (C-terminus)\nIf the 3FTyr-tRNACUA\n3FTyr enters the A-site, then 3FTyr will be incorporated and there\nwill be one 19F label at the C-terminus of the 100-aa polypeptide chain.\nIf RF1 enters the A-site, translation will be terminated. In this case, premature\ntermination will result in formation of a 99-aa peptide that only lacks the C-terminal\nresidue.\nProvided that both processes occur in the cell, a mixture of the desired full-length 19F-\nlabeled protein and the truncated 99-aa protein lacking a 19F label.\nE ) Based on your answers to C and D, what mutant protein you will select to employ in\nyour first in-cell 19F NMR experiments? Briefly explain your reasoning. Hint: to answer\nthis question, ask what are the possible consequences of your answer in D on your\nplanned 19F NMR experiment.\n\nBackground: Recall we learned in class that the incorporation of UAA by the Schultz\nmethod is low, ~20-30% for incorporation of 1 UAA, because of competition between\nthe tRNACUA and RF-1 is a major limitation for this method. As a result, it is expected\nthat both the desired full-length and 19F-labeled product and the product of premature\ntermination will exist in the cell. Moreover, we expect that less than one-half of\npolypeptide translated will be full-length and include the 19F label.\n\nAs a result, we must consider how the truncation products and mixtures of truncated/full-\nlength protein will influence the experiment we aim to perform. In this case, we want to\nwatch polypeptide folding in the cell by monitoring the 19F label. The truncated\npolypeptide do not have the 19F label, and so we will not be able to detect them by NMR.\nHowever, we must consider whether the presence of the truncated protein influences the\n19F NMR signal of the full-length polypeptide or the state of the cell. In other words, will\nthe folding trajectory of the 100-aa polypeptide be perturbed if there is a high\nconcentration of a truncated product? What if the truncated product form aggregates that\nhave deleterious consequences for the E. coli cell and, hence, the experiment? And are\nthe other possible pitfalls to consider?\n\nProtein 1: In this case, a mixture of products will have the desired 100-aa 19F-labeled\npolypeptide and fMet (position 1). It is reasonable to predict that the fMet resulting from\npremature termination will be a minimal perturbation.\n\nProtein 2: In this case, a mixture of products will have the desired full-length 19F-labeled\nprotein and the truncated and unlabeled 55-aa polypeptide. The presence of the 55-aa\ntruncation product may be a serious issue for the experiments (see background notes\nabove).\n\nProtein 3: In this case, a mixture of products will have the desired full-length 19F-labeled\nprotein and the truncated and unlabeled 99-aa polypeptide. The 99-aa polypeptide is very\nsimilar to the full-length polypeptide of interest. It is probable that the 99-aa polypeptide\nwill fold similarly to the 100-aa form because it only lacks the C-terminal residue.\nHowever, the 19F label would be reporting on <50% of the total protein of interest. Will\nthis be an issue for the experiment? With the current information, it is difficult to predict.\nIf the polypeptide forms oligomers and the resulting oligomers are mixtures (for instance,\nimagine that homodimers form and result in a mixed population with no, one or two 19F\nlabels), there could be complications for the analysis.\n\nBased on these considerations, I would select protein 1 for my first experiments.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu\n5.08J Biological Chemistry II\nSpring 2016\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: https://ocw.mit.edu/terms"

Label the syringes as \"1\" and \"2\" and list the reaction components housed in each\nsyringe for these 3 experiments.\nB) Draw a cartoon of the pre-loaded ribosomes placed into syringe 1 in experiments 1-3.\nNote that the tRNA is modified by a fluorescent proflavin. A dihydrouracil group was\nreplaced by the proflavin fluorophore (a small molecule). This fluorophore remains\nattached to the tRNA throughout the process. Experimental observations revealed that\nsuch fluorescent tRNAs can be used to monitor the translocation process. In simple\nterms, the fluorophore provides emission decrease or enhancement at various points\nduring the translocation process.\n\nC) Which step in the elongation process does this pre-loaded ribosome mimic?\nIt mimics the state right after peptide bond formation where the P and A site are occupied\nby the deacylated tRNA and peptidyl-tRNA, but before translocation.\nD) The dipeptide employed in this work is fMet-F where fMet stands for\nformylmethionine and F for phenylalanine. Provide an explanation for why this peptide\ncontains fMet.\nfMet, or formylmethionine, is the amino acid loaded onto the initiator tRNA. The\ninitiation process begins with a start codon. Since all peptides start with a start codon,\nthere is an fMet at the N-terminus of every growing amino acid chain during translation\nin prokaryotes. The phenylalanine (F) is the second amino acid on this peptide chain. The\nfMet-F is meant to mimic the dipeptide which resides in the A site right after peptide\nbond formation between the fMet-tRNAfMet (initiator tRNA) and a F-tRNAPhe in the A-\nsite.\nE) Design an experiment to convince yourself that the ribosome is in fact appropriately\nloaded to allow investigation of the translocation process. [Hint: think about the use of\nanother antibiotic.]\nYou could use puromycin or a puromycin analog like CC-puromycin shown in the lecture\nnotes. CC-puromycin has an additional Cytosine-Cytosine (CC) oligonucleotide\nattachment to better mimic the CCA-3' end of the tRNA and will also bind to the A site.\n(Recall, puromycin mimics the adenosine and amino acid on the 3' end of a tRNA and\nbinds to the A site) After translocation, the A site is vacated. When puromycin binds, it\ncan form a peptide bond with the Fmet-F-tRNAPhe , which is now at the P site. The\nproduct can be isolated and identified, and use of a radiolabeled CC-puromycin would\nfacilitate this process.\nF) Given the role of the antibiotics described above (viomycin, thiostrepton), provide a\nhypothesis for the increase in fluorescence observed in experiment 1 and not in\nexperiments 2 and 3 of Figure 1, following the initial rapid decrease in fluorescence\nobserved in all three experiments.\nRapid mixing using a stopped flow apparatus allows fast reactions to be monitored. Rate\nconstants up to 500 s-1 can be measured by this technique! We see a rapid drop in\nfluorescence in the data shown in Figure 1a. In fact, we see this drop in fluorescence for\nall experiments 1 - 3 (look back to what is in your syringes for each experiment -\nquestion A of this section). In other words, we observe that this drop in fluorescence\noccurs in both the absence and presence of antibiotics (viomycin and thiostrepton). See\nFigures 1a and 1c.\nRecall that the tRNA is labeled with proflavin, which is fluorescent. After the initial rapid\ndrop in fluorescence, only the inhibitor-free experiment (experiment 1) shows an increase\n\nin the observed fluorescence. Because this increase in fluorescence was suppressed with\nviomycin (inhibits translocation, but not GTP hydrolysis) and by thiostrepton (inhibits\ntranslocation and GTP hydrolysis), the increase in fluorescence in the inhibitor-free\nexperiment can be interpreted to be associated with translocation.\nAlso note (not required for answer): There is an initial rapid decrease in fluorescence\nobserved in all three experiments. This was proposed to be associated with the binding of\nEF-G to the pre-translocation complex. This proposal makes sense because EF-G can\nbind to the ribosome under all experimental conditions (neither antibiotic prevents EF-G\nbinding). To confirm this proposal, one can measure the effect of varying EF-G\nconcentration on the initial drop in fluorescence or doing site-directed mutagenesis on\nEF-G and creating mutants with a fluorescent probe that are incapable of binding.\nG) What do the data in Figure 2a tell you?\nSee part H. Both G and H are answered below.\nH) What do the data and the fit to the data in Figure 2b tell you?\nThe data shows that GTP hydrolysis, measured by release of inorganic phosphate, occurs\nat a rate constant of 120 s-1 . Furthermore, we observe the same rate constant with or\nwithout viomycin, indicating that viomycin does not have an effect on GTP hydrolysis.\nThe control, where EF-G is absent, shows that GTP hydrolysis does not take place. This\ncontrol indicates that EF-G is required for GTP hydrolysis.\nFigure 2b indicates that the rate of GTP hydrolysis measured by phosphate release is\n120 s-1 , whereas the rate of the overall reaction measured by fluorescence is 25 s-1 . This\ncomparison indicates that GTP hydrolysis is faster than translocation.\nI) Propose a model for the role of EF-G in translocation based on these data. Explain how\nthe data support your model.\nGTP is hydrolyzed before translocation. We can propose that EF-G hydrolyzes GTP and\nharnesses the chemical energy that is released into mechanical energy to translocate the\ntRNAs and mRNA relative to the ribosome.\nIf you have trouble thinking about this problem you can go to the literature and read the\npaper from which this data was taken: Nature 385 37-41 (1997).\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu\n5.08J Biological Chemistry II\nSpring 2016\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: https://ocw.mit.edu/terms"

      "content": "ANSWER KEY\n5.08 Biological Chemistry II (Spring 2016)\nProblem Set #4\nThis problem set contains one problem and 4 pages.\nQuestion 1:\nThe following experiments were performed in an effort to increase our understanding of ClpXP.\nA model substrate, the P22 Arc repressor (it is a homodimer), was engineered to contain a\nC-terminal ssrA tag. Additional Arc mutants were constructed, including one named NC11ox-\nArc-ssrA where the two Arc monomers were covalently linked with a disulfide (S--S) bond.\nThis mutant was prepared by mutating an asparagine to cysteine, and the purified protein was\nallowed to oxidize such that the disulfide bond formed. The family of Arc mutants and the\nstructure of the Arc dimer are shown in Figure 1. In panel B, one Arc monomer is black and\nthe other is grey. Similar to the titin I27 domain mutants discussed in class, Arc mutants\nwith a range of stabilities were characterized in previous studies.\nFigure 1. (A) The Arc mutants. The abbreviation \"st11\" stands for a short linker comprised of\neleven amino acids, His6KNQHE, that is between the Arc sequence and the ssrA tag. This linker\ncontains a His6 tag that was used for Ni-NTA affinity purification. (B) Structural depiction of the\nArc-ssrA homodimer. The ssrA tag is AALAYNEDNAA.\nIn a first set of experiments, the stability of the protein fold of each mutant was examined by\nthermal denaturation, which is a method for monitoring protein unfolding.

For more\ninformation, see https://ocw.mit.edu/help/faq-fair-use.\n\nB) What are two possibilities for how Arc-ssrA associates with ClpXP? For instance, what\nare possible Arc-ssrA:ClpXP stoichiometries?\n\nThe Arc-ssrA constructs are homodimers and each monomer unit has a C-terminal ssrA tag.\nThus, it is possible that one ClpXP associates with one of the Arc-ssrA tags, providing a 1:1\ncomplex. It is also possible that two ClpXP can associate with Arc at the same time such that\none ClpXP is bound to each tag. Given what we learned about how ClpXP binds and releases\nsubstrates multiple times when trying to denature them, a dynamic mixture is another\npossibility.\n\nC) In class, we described a five-step model put forth by Sauer and Baker for protein\ndegradation\nby\nClpXP.\nDescribe\nthese\nfive\nsteps\nand\ncorresponding\nthermodynamic/kinetic parameters that we discussed in class. Note which steps are ATP\ndependent.\n\nStep 1: Binding (Kd) The condemned protein is recognized by ClpXP via the ssrA tag.\nThe adaptor protein SspB may facilitate this process.\nStep 2: Denaturation (kden). This step requires ATP by ClpX. The folded substrate must be\ndenatured by the AAA+ ATPase.\nStep 3: Translocation (ktrans). This step also requires ATP. The substrate must be translocated\nthrough ClpX and into the ClpP degradation chamber.\nStep 4: Degradation (kdeg). The unfolded polypeptide is hydrolyzed. This step is fast (serine\nprotease action).\nStep 5: Peptide release. The short peptide fragments must be released from the chamber. We\nstated that this step is fast, but did not discuss it in detail from a kinetic standpoint.\n\nD) Describe three control experiments to show that degradation of the Arc-ssrA derivatives\nrequire ClpXP and ATP.\n\nObservation: Arc-ssrA + ClpXP + ATP degradation\n\nControl 1: Arc-ssrA + ClpP + ClpX no degradation (no ATP control)\nControl 2: Arc-ssrA + ClpX + ATP no degradation (no ClpP control)\nControl 3: Arc-ssrA + ClpP + ATP no degradation (no ClpX control)\n\nAnother possible control is to perform the assay in the presence of a protease inhibitor (block\nClpP action).\n\nIn each assay/control, the rate of degradation can be measured by using [35S]-labeled Arc-ssrA as\na substrate. Each reaction is quenched with acid at various time points, which results in\nprecipitation of any remaining full-length [35S]-labeled Arc-ssrA, and radioactivity in the pellet\nand supernatant can be measured.\n\nE) What do the data in Figure 2 tell you about the different Arc-ssrA constructs? Provide a\nrationale for the construction of the NC11ox-Arc-ssrA mutant. In other words, what\nquestion(s) could be addressed by using this mutant?\n\nThe various Arc constructs either (i) denature more readily with increasing temperature (FA10,\nIV37) or (ii) denature less readily (PL8, NC11ox) compared to wild-type Arc. These comparisons\nindicate that the different Arc constructs have different structural stability, and that changing the\namino acid sequence can alter the stability of the Arc protein fold. The less stable constructs are\nmore likely to be denatured/degraded faster by ClpXP (in analogy to what we learned with the\ntitin I27 substrates in class).\n\nThe NC11ox-Arc mutant is a very interesting construct. It was created to investigate the stability\nand degradation of a covalent dimer. Many questions can be probed with this mutant. For\ninstance, does the presence of two ssrA tags aid in ClpXP recognition? Does a covalent dimer\ntake longer to unfold (and more ATPs) than a non-covalent dimer? Comparing the covalent\ndimer to a non-covalent dimer, we can ask another question: when one monomer is denatured\nand translocated, will the other monomer (non-covalent or covalent) follow and be\ndenatured/degraded consecutively?\n\nNote: You can also imagine making an NC11ox-Arc analog that is a heterodimer such that only\none of the monomers has the ssrA tag. A comparison of the heterodimer and homodimer would\nprovide insight into the effect of one vs. two ssrA tags.\n\nF) What do the data in Figure 3 tell you about the relationship between mutant Arc-ssrA\nand the rates of protein degradation? Does the data tell you anything about the basis of\nsubstrate selection? If so, how?\n\nThe data in Figure 3 show that ClpXP degrades the various Arc proteins at different rates and in\nthe order IV37 > FA10 > wild-type > PL* ~ NC11ox. This trend corresponds to the thermal\ndenaturation studies: the mutants that display less thermostability are the mutants that are\ndegraded more readily (faster) by ClpXP. (Note: FA10 and IV37 are reversed, but the values are\npretty comparable. FA10 is slightly less thermostable than IV37, but FA10 degrades more\nslowly).\n\nThe KM can provide some insight into the substrate selection (recall that KM by itself does not tell\nus very much and is comprised of many rate constants). The KM values for wild-type and mutant\nArc are all similar, ranging between 1.0 ± 0.2 M and 1.5 ± 0.1 M. These values indicate that\nall four mutants have slightly higher affinity to ClpXP than the wild-type, but not by very much\n(do not over-interpret this data!). The KM values of the mutants are all pretty similar and only\nvary from 1.0 ± 0.2 to 1.2 ± 0.1.\n\nG) The role of ATP in proteasome machines is of major interest. From the data provided\nabove, state the major conclusions that can be drawn from this study. Does a comparison\nof the data in Figure 2 with the data in Table 2 give you any additional insight about the\nrole of ATP (hint: think about the experiments described in class for the titin I27\nmutants)?\n\nRecall that ClpX is an ATPase and ATP is needed for unfolding and translocation of a substrate.\nATP hydrolysis by ClpXP converts chemical energy into mechanical energy to \"tug\" at the\nprotein and denature it. ATP is also needed for pushing the peptide into the degradation chamber\n(translocation).\n\nWe observe higher rates of ATP turnover for Arc mutants that denature more readily (FA10,\nIV37). We can conclude that the stability of the protein influences how quickly ClpXP unfolds\nand translocates it, similar to what we learned about the titin I27 mutants. The less stable the\nprotein, the faster ClpXP acts as measured kinetically by ATP hydrolysis.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu\n5.08J Biological Chemistry II\nSpring 2016\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: https://ocw.mit.edu/terms"

(57 pts total) In class and in problem set #1, we saw that many nucleobases in tRNAs are post\ntranscriptionally modified. Post-transcriptional modification also occurs for the nucleobases in mRNA. Recently,\nstudies have demonstrated that N6-methylation of adenosine (forming m6A) is the most abundant post\ntranscriptional modification in the coding regions of mRNA. This observation begs a fundamental question:\nwhat is the role of m6A in mRNA decoding and polypeptide synthesis by the ribosome? This problem is based\non recent studies performed to address this question (Nat. Struc. Mol. Biol. 2016, 23, 110-115).\nH3C NH\nN\nN\nN\nN\nO\nHO\nHO\nOH\nN6-methyladenosine (m6A)\nThese studies examined the effect of m6A in the context of the kinetic model for tRNA selection and peptide\nbond formation originally described by Rodnina and co-workers. We discussed this model in class, and in\nrecitations #2 and #3, and the model is given in the Appendix.\nIn experiment #1, the researchers sought structural information about the codon-anticodon interaction in the\nribosome A-site when a codon containing m6A is in the A-site. Prior studies showed that m6A forms a canonical\nWatson-Crick base-pair with uridine (U). The researchers crystallized 30S ribosomal subunits from Thermus\nthermophilius with an oligonucleotide corresponding to the anticodon stem loop of tRNALys (anticodon UUU)\nand one of four different short mRNAs bound. Each structure indicated canonical Watson-Crick base-pairing of\nA-U and m6A-U in the A-site of the decoding center. The four short mRNAs employed are listed below.\n5'-(m6A)AA-UUU-3'\n5'-A(m6A)A-UUU-3'\n5'-AA(m6A)-UUU-3'\n5'-AAA-UUU-3'\nIn experiment #2, the researchers performed quench-flow kinetic experiments to evaluate the effect of m6A on\nthe ribosome-dependent rate of GTP hydrolysis by EF-Tu (kGTP). In this experiment, 70S E. coli ribosomes with\nfMet-tRNAfMet in the P-site and a mRNA with either AAA or (m6A)AA in the A-site were rapidly mixed with the\nEF-Tu![3H]-GTP!Lys-tRNALys ternary complex. The reactions were quenched with formic acid at varying time\npoints and the amount of GTP hydrolyzed was quantified. The resulting data are shown in Figure 1.\n\n5.08 Spring 2016 Exam 1\nb\n\n(c) Springer Nature Limited. Choi,J., K.

Using the\ndata for the kinetics of GTP hydrolysis and the data for fMet-Lys dipeptide formation, the researchers\nperformed a mathematical analysis that allowed them to determine the rate constant for tRNA accommodation\nplus peptidyl transfer. Thus, this rate constant includes all steps after GTP hydrolysis and includes peptidyl\ntransfer. We call this rate constant kacc-pep.

(43 pts total) Protein misfolding and aggregation is associated with many human diseases, including\nneurological disorders. As a result, there is significant interest in understanding the pathological processes that\noccur in diseased cells and result in misfolding as well as how healthy cells prevent protein aggregation and,\nwhen necessary, eliminate intracellular aggregates. This problem is based on recent studies that addressed\nthe latter phenomenon and specifically interrogated the disaggregase activity of the HSP70 (HSP = heat shock\nprotein) chaperone of human cells (Nature 2015, 524, 247-251).\nThe HSP70 cycle is shown below where an unfolded polypeptide is the substrate. By a generally accepted\nextrapolation, this cycle can be extended to occur on the surfaces of protein aggregates. In class, we\ndiscussed the DnaK/DnaJ cycle. Recall that DnaK (chaperone) is a Hsp70 and DnaJ (co-chaperone) is a J-\nprotein. We learned that J-proteins have structural and functional diversity.\n(nucleotide\nexchange factor)\n\n(c) Springer Nature Limited. Nillegoda, N.B., J. Kirstein, et al. \"Crucial HSP70 co-chaperone complex unlocks metazoan protein\ndisaggregation.\" Nature 2015 Aug 13; 524(7564): 247-251. All rights reserved. This content is excluded from our Creative\nCommons license. For more information, see https://ocw.mit.edu/help/faq-fair-use.\nIn E. coli and other bacterial systems, there is a \"protein disaggregase\" named Hsp100 that can work with\nDnaK/DnaJ to disaggregate and refold insoluble aggregated protein. In the current model, the action of\nDnaK/DnaJ exposes some polypeptide segments from the aggregate. Hsp100 can bind to these exposed\nsegments and unfold the bound polypeptide. As a result, the polypeptide becomes soluble and is released\nfrom the aggregate. Subsequently, DnaK/DnaJ or other chaperone machinery like GroEL/GroES can fold the\npolypeptide to its native form. If this process happens many times, we can imagine that an aggregate can be\ncompletely eliminated.\nIn humans, there is no HSP100, and HSP70 itself (with its nucleotide exchange factor HSP110) exhibits very\npoor disaggregase activity in vitro. These observations beg a fundamental question: how does the human cell\neliminate protein aggregates? Do select co-chaperones work with HSP70 to disentangle aggregated protein in\nhuman cells?\n[Note: in bacteria, the abbreviations for proteins only have the first letter capitalized (e.g. Hsp) whereas for\neukaryotes all three letters are capitalized (e.g. HSP).]\nHumans have >50 J-proteins that can be divided into three classes named A, B and C. In prior work, class A\nand B J-proteins have been implicated in protein quality control. Thus, the researchers hypothesized that\ncertain class A and B J-proteins may cooperate with HSP70 to afford robust disaggregation activity. They\ndesigned a series of assays to test this notion.\nThe majority of these assays utilize an enzyme named firefly luciferase. This enzyme catalyzes oxygenation of\nluciferin by the following two-step reaction:\n\n5.08 Spring 2016 Exam 1\nluciferin + ATP a luciferyl adenylate + PPi\nluciferyl adenylate + O2 a oxyluciferin + AMP + light\nThe structure of firefly luciferin and oxyluciferin is shown here:\nO\nH\nHO\nHO\nS\nN\nCO2H\nN\nS\nS\nN\nN\nS\nFirefly luciferin\nOxyluciferin\nLight is emitted because the reaction forms oxyluciferin in an electronically excited state, which emits a photon\nof light upon its return to the ground state. These reactions provide fireflies with their luminescence!\nThe researchers found conditions where thermal denaturation of luciferase results in formation of\ninsoluble aggregates. These aggregates were used as a model substrate for the studies described below.\nIn experiment #1, pre-formed luciferase aggregates were incubated with HSP70-HSP110 (HSP110 is the\nnucleotide-exchange factor for HSP70) in the absence or presence of J-proteins JA2 (class A J-protein) and\nJB1 (class B J-protein). These mixtures contained 2 mM ATP and an ATP regenerating system. Reactivation\nof aggregated luciferase was monitored over time. To monitor for luciferase reactivation, a 1-μL aliquot of the\nmixture described above was taken and transferred to a buffer containing luciferin (125 μM), ATP (2.5 mM),\nand MgCl2 (7.5 mM). Because light is emitted as a result of luciferase activity, luminescence was monitored.\nThe resulting data are shown in Figure 1.\na\nb\n(c) Springer Nature Limited. Nillegoda, N.B., J.

Details for this assay are not needed.\nIn experiment #2, the authors incubated aggregated [3H]-luciferase with HSP70-HSP110 and the J-proteins\nJA2 and JB1 in the presence of a GroEL variant named GroEL(D87K). This GroEL variant has a single point\nmutation at position 87 in the amino acid sequence (Asp a Lys). Prior characterization of GroEL(D87K)\nshowed that it is deficient in ATP hydrolysis and, as a result, it can bind and trap non-native substrates. In this\n\n5.08 Spring 2016 Exam 1\nexperiment, the researchers performed two analyses: (i) they determined how much [3H]-luciferase was\ntrapped by GroEL(D98K) and (ii) they quantified how much luciferase was reactivated in the presence of\nGroEL(D87K). The assay set-up was the same as for experiment #1 except that the luciferase was\nradiolabeled and GroEL(D87K) was included in the assay. GroEL(D87K) was in excess over the luciferase\nconcentration. The resulting data are shown in Figure 2.\na\nb\n\nFigure 2.

After 120 minutes, the samples were analyzed by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC).

(57 pts total) In class and in problem set #1, we saw that many nucleobases in tRNAs are post\ntranscriptionally modified. Post-transcriptional modification also occurs for the nucleobases in mRNA. Recently,\nstudies have demonstrated that N6-methylation of adenosine (forming m6A) is the most abundant post\ntranscriptional modification in the coding regions of mRNA. This observation begs a fundamental question:\nwhat is the role of m6A in mRNA decoding and polypeptide synthesis by the ribosome? This problem is based\non recent studies performed to address this question (Nat. Struc. Mol. Biol. 2016, 23, 110-115).\nH3C NH\nN\nN\nN\nN\nO\nHO\nHO\nOH\nN6-methyladenosine (m6A)\nThese studies examined the effect of m6A in the context of the kinetic model for tRNA selection and peptide\nbond formation originally described by Rodnina and co-workers. We discussed this model in class, and in\nrecitations #2 and #3, and the model is given in the Appendix.\nIn experiment #1, the researchers sought structural information about the codon-anticodon interaction in the\nribosome A-site when a codon containing m6A is in the A-site. Prior studies showed that m6A forms a canonical\nWatson-Crick base-pair with uridine (U). The researchers crystallized 30S ribosomal subunits from Thermus\nthermophilius with an oligonucleotide corresponding to the anticodon stem loop of tRNALys (anticodon UUU)\nand one of four different short mRNAs bound. Each structure indicated canonical Watson-Crick base-pairing of\nA-U and m6A-U in the A-site of the decoding center. The four short mRNAs employed are listed below.\n5'-(m6A)AA-UUU-3'\n5'-A(m6A)A-UUU-3'\n5'-AA(m6A)-UUU-3'\n5'-AAA-UUU-3'\nIn experiment #2, the researchers performed quench-flow kinetic experiments to evaluate the effect of m6A on\nthe ribosome-dependent rate of GTP hydrolysis by EF-Tu (kGTP). In this experiment, 70S E. coli ribosomes with\nfMet-tRNAfMet in the P-site and a mRNA with either AAA or (m6A)AA in the A-site were rapidly mixed with the\nEF-Tu![3H]-GTP!Lys-tRNALys ternary complex. The reactions were quenched with formic acid at varying time\npoints and the amount of GTP hydrolyzed was quantified. The resulting data are shown in Figure 1.\n\n5.08 Spring 2016 Exam 1\nb\n\n(c) Springer Nature Limited. Choi,J., K.

They used [3H]-fMet-tRNAfMet and unlabeled GTP in these assays. Using the\ndata for the kinetics of GTP hydrolysis and the data for fMet-Lys dipeptide formation, the researchers\nperformed a mathematical analysis that allowed them to determine the rate constant for tRNA accommodation\nplus peptidyl transfer. Thus, this rate constant includes all steps after GTP hydrolysis and includes peptidyl\ntransfer. We call this rate constant kacc-pep. Note: This rate constant includes all steps after GTP hydrolysis and\nincludes peptidyl transfer and thus is not given in the kinetic model of Rodnina.

(5 pts) Draw the Watson-Crick base-pair for A-U.\nSee lecture 2 slides.\nNote: Many students drew uracil incorrectly, and some depictions included three H-bonds between A and U.\n2. (5 pts) The resolution of each crystal structures obtained in experiment #1 was between 3.35-3.45 A. Will\nthe structural determination provide you with information about the different conformation of the 6-methyl group\nof m6A? Briefly explain your reasoning.\nResolution was discussed in recitation #1 and some guidelines are given in the recitation #1 packet. See\ndescription and Figure for details.\nIt might be possible to discern different conformations of the methyl group with respect to the N atom from this\nstructure, but likely difficult. Rotamers of the methyl group (e.g. antiperiplanar or gauche with respect to the C-\nN bond) cannot be discerned.\nNote: In the published work, the researchers did not obtain well-ordered electron density for the 6-methyl group\nof m6A, and they speculated this occurred because of rotational movement about the C-N bond.\n\n5.08 Spring 2016 Exam 1\n3. (2 pts) Why was it important for the crystallographic work to be performed?\nThis experiment was important because it confirmed that canonical base pairing occurs between the triplet\ncodons containing m6A and the UUU anticodon of the tRNA in the A site of the decoding center. This is\nimportant to know for interpreting the results of the biochemical experiments.\n4. (5 pts) Draw the ribosome employed in experiments #2 and #3 prior to mixing. Be sure to label all\ncomponents and include the relevant mRNA codons.\n30S\nor (m6A)AA\nNote: There must be a start codon in the P-site for the fMet-tRNAfMet to be delivered to the P-site during\ninitiation. A number of students drew the P-site with no mRNA in the P-site. Also, several students used the\nshort mRNAs for the crystallography experiment as the mRNA bound to the ribosome. These mRNAs do not\ncontain a start codon and thus cannot be used in the biochemical experiments (think about what needs to\nhappen to assemble the 70S ribosome and have initiator tRNA bound).\n5. (5 pts) Draw the quench flow system employed for experiments #2 and #3. Indicate the components of\neach syringe.\nSyringe 1: 70S ribosomes with fMet-tRNAfMet in P-site and an empty A-site (see #4 above).\nSyringe 2: EF-Tu·GTP·Lys-tRNALys (with or without [3H] radiolabel).\nSyringe 3: Quencher (formic acid).\nNote: A number of students drew the apparatus with the\nquencher going directly into the mixer where solutions 1\nand 2 are mixed, which is incorrect. There are two mixers\nin a quench flow apparatus. The first mixer fills with the\ncontents of syringes 1 and 2 in a 1:1 ratio and rapid\nmixing occurs. Then, after a period of time, the solution is\nmixed with the quencher, contained in the third syringe, in\nthe second mixer (again, a 1:1 ratio of reaction mixture\nand quencher). See recitation #2 and #3 materials as\nwell as your class notes on studies of EF-P for additional\ndepictions of the correct plumbing diagrams.\n\n5.08 Spring 2016 Exam 1\n6. (5 pts) Using the chemical structures for reactants and products, provide the equation for [3H]-GTP\nhydrolysis by EF-Tu and indicate how you will monitor this reaction.\nGTP hydrolysis by EF-Tu results in formation of GDP and Pi. The following scheme was provided in the\nanswer key to problem set #1, and we discussed attack at Pα or Pβ in lecture. Activation of the water molecule\nby His84 of EF-Tu was not required for full credit.\nWhen GTP or ATP are hydrolyzed, resulting in formation of GDP/ADP and Pi, the water molecule attacks at\nPα. A number of students presented mechanisms where the water molecule attacked Pβ, which is incorrect.\nFor the [3H] label, this label cannot be on one of the phosphate groups because these protons are\nexchangeable (think about what is happening chemically here in terms of the H on the phosphates - it is\nfundamentally different than using [32P] to label the P atoms of GTP). Hydrolysis of [3H]-GTP results in [3H]\nGDP and Pi. To monitor the reaction, the [3H]-GTP and [3H]-GDP must be separated, which can be achieved\nby ion exchange chromatography (think about the different charges) or TLC, and then the radioactivity of the\n[3H]-GTP and [3H]-GDP fractions/spots can be measured and quantified. This type of work was discussed in\nrecitations #2 and #3.\n7. (10 pts) What do we learn from the data in Figure 1a (experiment #2) about the effect of a codon\ncontaining m6A on ribosome-dependent GTP hydrolysis by EF-Tu? Be sure to use all of the data in the figure\nto answer this question.\nThe data in Figure 1a compare GTP hydrolysis by EF-Tu when AAA or (m6A)AA is in the A-site. A 3° complex\nof EF-Tu, [3H]-labeled GTP, and Lys-tRNALys was employed in these studies.\nAAA is the positive control and we see that 100% of GTP is hydrolyzed within ≈1 sec.\nIn the (m6A)AA case, there is also 100% hydrolysis of GTP, but the rate of GTP hydrolysis is slower. We see\nthat 100% of GTP is hydrolyzed in ≈4 sec.\nTherefore, the comparison indicates that a (m6A)AA codon (i.e. m6A in the first position) results in slower GTP\nhydrolysis by EF-Tu, but all GTP are hydrolyzed.\n\n5.08 Spring 2016 Exam 1\n8. (5 pts) What do we learn from a comparison of the kcat / KM values shown in Figure 1b (experiment #2)? Be\nsure to include a definition of this parameter in your answer.\nThe kcat/Km is the specificity constant and it reports on the catalytic efficiency of an enzyme towards a specific\nsubstrate. We see that the AAA a (m6A)AA substitution results in ≈12-fold decrease in the efficiency of GTP\nhydrolysis by EF-Tu.\nFor AAA, kcat/Km ≈15 μM-1 s-1\nFor (m6A)AA, kcat/Km ≈1.4 μM-1 s-1\nNote: This change is real and meaningful, about one order of magnitude. I (Nolan) would not use language like\n\"dramatic\" to describe this change. This type of language was used in a number of student answers to\nquestions.\n9. (10 pts) What do we learn from the data presented in Figure 2a (experiment #3)? Be sure to use all of the\ndata in the figure to answer this question.\nThe data in Figure 2a show the amount of [3H]-fMet-Lys dipeptide formation over time when either AAA or\n(m6)AA is in the A-site of the ribosome.\nAAA is the positive control, and we see that 0.5 μM of dipeptide is formed within ≈1 sec. Given that the ternary\ncomplex concentration used in this experiment was 0.5 μM, this result indicates that the peptidyl transfer\nreaction reached completion - in other words, all Lys was transferred from Lys-tRNALys in the A-site to fMet\ntRNAfMet in the P-site.\nWith (m6A)AA, we observe that dipeptide formation reaches only ≈0.3 μM and takes ≈3-4 secs. Thus, not all of\nthe Lys is transferred to the P-site aa-tRNA despite the fact that all the GTP is hydrolyzed (as we learned from\nthe data in Figure 1a), not all Lys is transferred.\nNote: Many students did not present a quantitative analysis when answering this question.\n10. (5 pts) This work was motivated by a fundamental question: what is the role of m6A in mRNA decoding and\npolypeptide synthesis by the ribosome? Using the data presented in this problem as well as class discussions\nand your knowledge of the kinetic model presented by Rodnina and co-workers, provide a reasonable answer\nto this question in the context of the kinetic model.\nIt appears that the role of m6A is to modulate (slow) the translation rate (i.e., regulation). We see that the GTP\nhydrolysis rate decreases with m6A present in the A-site codon (Fig 1). Moreover, the data in Fig 2a indicate\nthat the rate for all steps after GTP hydrolysis decreases ≈2-fold (≈12 to ≈7 s-1 , Fig 2b). The data in Fig 2a\nindicate proof-reading - effectively all GTP are hydrolyzed, but some Lys-tRNALys are rejected after GTP\nhydrolysis. This behavior is reminiscent of near-cognate codon/anticodon interactions. The ≈1.4 decrease in\nfMet-Lys formation and the ≈12 fold decrease in kcat/Km for GTP hydrolysis suggest an overall ≈18 fold\ndecrease in translation of (m6A)AA versus AAA.\nNote: for full credit, it was necessary to relate the experimental data back to the kinetic model provided in the\nAppendix and discussed in class and recitation. Merely repeating the observations was insufficient for full\ncredit.\n\n5.08 Spring 2016 Exam 1\n2. (43 pts total) Protein misfolding and aggregation is associated with many human diseases, including\nneurological disorders. As a result, there is significant interest in understanding the pathological processes that\noccur in diseased cells and result in misfolding as well as how healthy cells prevent protein aggregation and,\nwhen necessary, eliminate intracellular aggregates. This problem is based on recent studies that addressed\nthe latter phenomenon and specifically interrogated the disaggregase activity of the HSP70 (HSP = heat shock\nprotein) chaperone of human cells (Nature 2015, 524, 247-251).\nThe HSP70 cycle is shown below where an unfolded polypeptide is the substrate. By a generally accepted\nextrapolation, this cycle can be extended to occur on the surfaces of protein aggregates. In class, we\ndiscussed the DnaK/DnaJ cycle. Recall that DnaK (chaperone) is a Hsp70 and DnaJ (co-chaperone) is a J-\nprotein. We learned that J-proteins have structural and functional diversity.\n(nucleotide\nexchange factor)\n\n(c) Springer Nature Limited. Nillegoda, N.B., J. Kirstein, et al. \"Crucial HSP70 co-chaperone complex unlocks metazoan protein\ndisaggregation.\" Nature 2015 Aug 13; 524(7564): 247-251. All rights reserved.

For more information, see https://ocw.mit.edu/help/faq-fair-use.\nIn E. coli and other bacterial systems, there is a \"protein disaggregase\" named Hsp100 that can work with\nDnaK/DnaJ to disaggregate and refold insoluble aggregated protein. In the current model, the action of\nDnaK/DnaJ exposes some polypeptide segments from the aggregate. Hsp100 can bind to these exposed\nsegments and unfold the bound polypeptide. As a result, the polypeptide becomes soluble and is released\nfrom the aggregate. Subsequently, DnaK/DnaJ or other chaperone machinery like GroEL/GroES can fold the\npolypeptide to its native form. If this process happens many times, we can imagine that an aggregate can be\ncompletely eliminated.\nIn humans, there is no HSP100, and HSP70 itself (with its nucleotide exchange factor HSP110) exhibits very\npoor disaggregase activity in vitro. These observations beg a fundamental question: how does the human cell\neliminate protein aggregates? Do select co-chaperones work with HSP70 to disentangle aggregated protein in\nhuman cells?\n[Note: in bacteria, the abbreviations for proteins only have the first letter capitalized (e.g. Hsp) whereas for\neukaryotes all three letters are capitalized (e.g. HSP).]\nHumans have >50 J-proteins that can be divided into three classes named A, B and C. In prior work, class A\nand B J-proteins have been implicated in protein quality control. Thus, the researchers hypothesized that\ncertain class A and B J-proteins may cooperate with HSP70 to afford robust disaggregation activity. They\ndesigned a series of assays to test this notion.\nThe majority of these assays utilize an enzyme named firefly luciferase. This enzyme catalyzes oxygenation of\nluciferin by the following two-step reaction:\n\n5.08 Spring 2016 Exam 1\nluciferin + ATP a luciferyl adenylate + PPi\nluciferyl adenylate + O2 a oxyluciferin + AMP + light\nThe structure of firefly luciferin and oxyluciferin is shown here:\nO\nH\nHO\nHO\nS\nN\nCO2H\nN\nS\nS\nN\nN\nS\nFirefly luciferin\nOxyluciferin\nLight is emitted because the reaction forms oxyluciferin in an electronically excited state, which emits a photon\nof light upon its return to the ground state. These reactions provide fireflies with their luminescence!\nThe researchers found conditions where thermal denaturation of luciferase results in formation of\ninsoluble aggregates. These aggregates were used as a model substrate for the studies described below.\nIn experiment #1, pre-formed luciferase aggregates were incubated with HSP70-HSP110 (HSP110 is the\nnucleotide-exchange factor for HSP70) in the absence or presence of J-proteins JA2 (class A J-protein) and\nJB1 (class B J-protein). These mixtures contained 2 mM ATP and an ATP regenerating system. Reactivation\nof aggregated luciferase was monitored over time. To monitor for luciferase reactivation, a 1-μL aliquot of the\nmixture described above was taken and transferred to a buffer containing luciferin (125 μM), ATP (2.5 mM),\nand MgCl2 (7.5 mM). Because light is emitted as a result of luciferase activity, luminescence was monitored.\nThe resulting data are shown in Figure 1.\na\nb\n(c) Springer Nature Limited. Nillegoda, N.B., J.

The experimental details are described above.\n(b) Reactivation of a different enzyme, α-glucosidase. Details for this assay are not needed.\nIn experiment #2, the authors incubated aggregated [3H]-luciferase with HSP70-HSP110 and the J-proteins\nJA2 and JB1 in the presence of a GroEL variant named GroEL(D87K). This GroEL variant has a single point\nmutation at position 87 in the amino acid sequence (Asp a Lys). Prior characterization of GroEL(D87K)\nshowed that it is deficient in ATP hydrolysis and, as a result, it can bind and trap non-native substrates. In this\n\n5.08 Spring 2016 Exam 1\nexperiment, the researchers performed two analyses: (i) they determined how much [3H]-luciferase was\ntrapped by GroEL(D98K) and (ii) they quantified how much luciferase was reactivated in the presence of\nGroEL(D87K). The assay set-up was the same as for experiment #1 except that the luciferase was\nradiolabeled and GroEL(D87K) was included in the assay. GroEL(D87K) was in excess over the luciferase\nconcentration. The resulting data are shown in Figure 2.\na\nb\n\nFigure 2.

This data was recorded 40\nminutes after initiation of the assay.\nIn experiment #3, the researchers again incubated [3H]-luciferase with HSP70-HSP110 and J-proteins JA2\nand JB1. After 120 minutes, the samples were analyzed by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC). This\nmethod separates biomolecules on the basis of size, and larger biomolecules come off the column at lower\nelution volumes. In this case, the SEC column was attached to a scintillation counter. The resulting data are\nshown in Figure 3.\na\nb\nFigure 3. Analysis of samples of aggregated [3H]-luciferase treated with HSP70-HSP110 and J-proteins.\n(a) SEC chromatograms.

(2 pts) The luciferase-catalyzed reaction is familiar. Where have we seen this chemistry before?\nThis chemistry / reaction mechanism is similar to that employed by aminoacyl tRNA synthetases to load amino\nacids onto their respective tRNAs.\nNote: we will see this chemistry again soon with the adenylation domains of NRPS, which select and activate\namino and aryl acid monomers.\n2. (2 pts) In experiment #1, the authors monitor reactivation of luciferase. What steps must occur for luciferase\nto be reactivated?\nFor luciferase to be reactivated, luciferase monomers must be removed from the aggregate. Thus,\ndisaggregation/unfolding must occur and then the polypeptide must be folded to its native state.\n3. (5 pts) What do we learn from the data in Figure 1a (experiment #1) about the action of J-proteins JA2 and\nJB1? Be sure to use all of the data in the figure to answer this question.\nIn the absence of chaperones or J-proteins, there is no reactivation of luciferase. Moreover, the chaperones\nalone cannot disaggregate luciferase. In contrast, in the presence of J-proteins, reactivation occurs with JA2\n(≈20% reactivation after 120 min) < JB1 (≈40% after 120 min) << a 1:1 mixture of JA2 and JB1 (≈100% after\n120 min). These data indicate that JA2 and JB1 both function as disaggregases, and that the combined\ndisaggregase activity of JA2 and JB1 results in an enhancement in the rate of luciferase reactivation. This data\npoints to synergistic action of JA2 and JB1.\n4. (4 pts) The data in Figure 1b (experiment #1) were obtained for a different protein aggregate. Briefly\ncomment on why this experiment was performed (mostly likely reason) and what the data show.\nInvestigating the α-glucosidase aggregate allows the researchers to evaluate whether the observations made\nwith the luciferase are specific to that model substrate or a general phenomenon.\nAs observed for aggregated luciferase, the combination of JA2 and JB1 results in enhanced reactivation of α\nglucosidase compared to either J-protein alone (JA2 ≈ JB1 < JA2+JB1). In contrast to the luciferase\nexperiment, complete reactivation is not observed - only ≈25% in 300 min. It appears that the α-glucosidase\naggregate is more difficult to disaggregate and/or more difficult to refold than luciferase.\n\n5.08 Spring 2016 Exam 1\n5. (5 pts) Draw a cartoon of GroEL/GroES indicating its subunit composition.\nNote: A number of students did not indicate that\nGroES is a hepatmer. Also, a number of students\nprovided very artistic depictions of this\nmacromolecular machine that I (Nolan) enjoyed very\nmuch!\n6. (5 pts) Briefly explain what happens in the assays where GroEL was added (experiment #2, Figure 2).\nIn this experiment, a GroEL variant was employed. There was not GroES included in the assays. This variant,\nGroEL(D87K), is defective in ATP hydrolysis. As a result, GroEL(D87K) can bind and trap the unfolded\nmonomers. If GroEL(D87K) binds and traps a luciferase monomer, there is no reactivation of this monomer\nbecause the HSP70-HSP110 system cannot fold it. Therefore, the readout of this assay using the\nGroEL(D87K) trap is disaggregation only (as opposed to disaggregation and re-folding).\nIn Figure 2a, negligible luciferase is trapped by GroEL when no chaperones are included, indicating that there\nis negligible disaggregation of luciferase. When either JA2 only or JB1 only are added, we see a ≈4-fold\nincrease in trapped luciferase. Under these conditions, some disaggregation occurs and the unfolded\nmonomers released from the aggregates are trapped by the GroEL(D87K). When JA2 and JB1 are both\npresent, there is an ≈18 fold increase in trapped luciferase. This data indicates that the combination of JA2 and\nJB1 results in enhanced disaggregation compared to either JA2 or JB1 alone.\nFrom Figure 2b, we can conclude that the presence of GroEL(D87K) blocks reactivation of luciferase by\nHSP70-HSP110. This data shows that GroEL is indeed sequestering the unfolded polypeptide and preventing\nrefolding/reactivation by the chaperones.\nNote: GroEL does not bind the aggregates. We discussed in class that the chamber fits polypeptides up to ≈60\nkDa. Moreover, if GroEL is deficient in ATP hydrolysis and if there is no GroES, it will not fold polypeptides and\nnot have unfoldase activity. GroEL was used as a tool in these studies and these experiments do not reflect\nthe cellular situation where GroEL/GroES are present.\n7. (10 pts) What do we learn from the data presented in Figure 3 (experiment #3) about the function of JA2\nand JB1 in protein disaggregation?\nThe data in Figure 3 provide information on the size distribution of the luciferase aggregates in the absence of\nchaperones and in the presence of the J-proteins.\nWhen no chaperones are present, a peak for aggregate of >5,000 kDa and a broad peak centered at ≈670 kDa\nare observed. This chromatogram reports on the starting aggregate distribution.\nWith JA2 only, the >5,000-kDa peak persists, the ≈670-kDa peak decreases to the lower molecular weight\nside, and a new peak at ≈44 kDa forms. This new peak is presumably folded luciferase.\nWith JB1 only, the >5,000 kDa peak decreases markedly and the ≈670-kDa peak decreases on the higher MW\nside, and a new peak of ≈44 kDa forms.\n\n5.08 Spring 2016 Exam 1\nWith both JA2 and JB1, we see more of the ≈44-kDa peak and a decrease of the higher molecular weight\npeaks. Moreover, we see complete reduction of the peaks in the ≈670-kDa range when both JA2 and JB1 are\npresent.\nThese descriptions are based on the chromatograms, and the data in Figure 3b provide quantification of the\nfractions.\nThese results indicate that:\n(i)\nJA2 preferentially works on smaller aggregates (less than ≈670 kDa)\n(ii)\nJB1 prefers large aggregates (>670 kDa).\n(iii)\nIn the ≈670-kDa region, some aggregates are only decreased when both J-proteins are present.\n8. (5 pts) How do these experiments inform our understanding of protein disaggregation in human cells?\nThese experiments implicate J-proteins as disaggregases, and we can reason that J-proteins function as\ndisaggregases in human cells (perhaps similar to how HSP100 works in bacterial cells). The data show that J-\nproteins cooperate with HSP70-HSP110 to disaggregate aggregated proteins and allow the extracted\nmonomers to refold and achieve their native state. Thus, we can postulate that these proteins work together in\nthe cell to provide similar function. Moreover, the data show that different J-proteins work on different types of\naggregates - JA2 disaggregates relatively small aggregates whereas JB1 disaggregates larger aggregates.\n9. (5 pts) It is always important to consider how the conditions of in vitro studies and the results relate to the\nphysiological environment. For this set of experiments, how might the in vitro assays differ from disaggregation\nin the cell? (Full credit for any reasonable answer that is clearly articulated and justified.)\nSeveral possibilities are given below. Many more are possible.\n1. The luciferase aggregate contains only one protein and the protein is not of human origin. Cellular\naggregates are likely more complex with more than one protein (recall macromolecular crowding).\n2. Luciferase is not a human protein and therefore the results may have questionable significance in cells.\n3. There are other chaperones and J-proteins in a human cell. These proteins may also cooperate with\nHSP70-HSP110 and JA2/JB1 in disaggregation.\n4. The relative concentrations of aggregates, chaperones and J-proteins used in these studies may not reflect\nthe relative concentrations in the cell.\nNote: a statement that the cellular environment is crowded without any additional reasoning/justification was\ninsufficient for full credit.\nEND OF EXAM\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu\n5.08J Biological Chemistry II\nSpring 2016\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: https://ocw.mit.edu/terms"

In recent work, researchers discovered that B.\nxenovorans biosynthesizes and exports a non-ribosomal peptide when cultured under conditions of iron limitation\n(PloS ONE 2016, ASAP). The chemical structure of this new metabolite revealed a number of non-proteinogenic\namino acids and is shown below:\nBioinformatics analysis indicated that the NRPS responsible for synthesis of this molecule is composed of two\nproteins, MbaA and MbaB, shown below.\nIndividual domains of MbaA were overexpressed and purified. Biochemical characterization revealed the A\ndomain selectivity as indicated below. ATP-PPi exchange assays revealed that the non-proteinogenic amino\nacids L-N-N-formyl-ornithine and D--hydroxy-aspartate are activated by the A domains of the loading module\nand the first elongation module, respectively.

It must\ntransition from a swarmer cell to a stalked cell during its life cycle as shown in the image below. The transition\nfrom swarmer cell to stalked cell is driven by the degradation of key regulatory proteins that include\nTacC (a developmental regulator) and CtrA (a transcription factor). This question examines the role of\nClpXP and adaptors in protein degradation during the C. crescentus cell cycle (Cell 2015, 163, 419-431).\nPrior studies revealed that the degradation of TacC and CtrA depends on a protein named CpdR that\nfunctions as an adaptor for ClpXP. CpdR functions differently from SspB, the adaptor protein we discussed in\nclass that recognizes the ssrA tag. CpdR itself does not bind a condemned protein substrate readily. Instead, it\nbinds to ClpX and effectively \"prepares\" ClpX for engagement with select substrates. Binding of CpdR to ClpX\nresults in some conformational change and formation of a \"recruitment interface\" where certain condemned\nDimorphic cell cycle of C. crescentus.\n(c) Kathleen Ryan, University of California, Berkeley.

Other biological studies have identified additional protein factors that are important for cell-\ncycle dependent protein degradation in C. crescentus; however, many mechanistic details about how these\nadditional proteins function to modulate protein degradation by ClpXP is unclear. The experiments below\nconsider one of these proteins named RcdA.\nIn experiment #1, cultures of either wild-type C. crescentus or a mutant strain were synchronized such that all\nof the cells were at the same point in the cell cycle. The mutants are rcdA (cannot express functional RcdA)\nand cpdR (cannot express functional CpdR). Equal numbers of swarmer cells were released into fresh culture\nmedium and the culture was allowed to grow. Aliquots of the culture were taken at different time points\ncorresponding to different stages in the cell cycle. The cells were lysed and the lysates were separated by SDS-\nPAGE and probed with anti-TacA, anti-CtrA, anti-McpA and anti-ClpP antibodies. TacA, CtrA, and McpA are\nproteins that are known substrates for ClpXP. The resulting data are shown in Figure 1.\nFigure 1.

The effect of CpdR and RcdA on ClpXP-catalyzed degradation of TacA was examined.\nDegradation assays were performed by combining ClpXP, ATP, TacA, and CpdR and/or RcdA, and these\nreactions were quenched various time points. TacA degradation was monitored by SDS-PAGE. The resulting\ndata are shown in Figure 2.\nNote: \"no addition\" means that CpdR and RcdA are not added. ClpXP is present.\nFigure 2.

RcdA has a disordered C-terminal\nregion and the researchers questioned whether this region of RcdA is important.\nIn experiment #4, the researchers overexpressed and purified His6-RcdA-C, a RcdA variant that lacks 19\nresidues from the C-terminus, and used this protein in studies of TacA degradation by ClpXP.

Show the reaction mechanism.\nA domains are adenylation domains that activate monomers as adenylates for subsequent transfer to T domains.\nThe chemistry is shown below:\nOK to have included transfer to the T domain in the answer, but not necessary for full credit.\nOK to have a base on the A domain deprotonate the amino acid, or to present as shown above.\nCorrect structure of ATP required for full credit.\n(ii) Is the result for monomer 8 expected or unexpected? Briefly explain your reasoning.\nThis question requires that you think about the A domain substrate and chemistry. It activates amino acids and\naryl acids. We see no activity of the A domain of MbaB towards monomer 8. This result is expected because\n1,4-diaminobutane has no -CO2H group, so an amino adenylate cannot be formed.\n(iii) What do we learn about the substrate specificity of the A domain of MbaB from the data in Figure 1? Provide\nthree conclusions that summarize the data completely.\nThe ATP/PPi exchange assay tells us about what amino acid monomers are selected and activated by a given\nA domain. The observed counts per minute (CPM) for the different samples are as follows:\n4 > 3 > 2 >1 ~ 5 - 9\n1. The A domain of MbaB selects and activates several monomers with preference 4 > 3 > 2.\n2. There is negligible activity with monomers 1 and 5-8 (9 is a no monomer control). Therefore MbaB does not\nactivate these monomers. These trends can be correlated to structural features (e.g. modification of the\namino group), but these details were not required for full credit.\n3.

(10 pts) At this point, the researchers were scratching their heads about the 1,4-diaminobutane moiety in the\nsiderophore and how termination occurs, and performed further bioinformatics analyses. This effort revealed a\ngene encoding a single-domain protein upstream of the mbaA and mbaB genes.

Be sure to justify your explanation using your knowledge of assembly\nline biosynthesis and chemistry.

(5 pts) Having thought about this work, you hypothesize that MbaC interacts with one or more components of\nthe NRPS, and you decide to test your hypothesis by performing a cross-linking experiment. Briefly explain the\ndesign of your experiment, including what type of cross-linker will you employ and why.\nI would use a specific heterobifunctional cross-linker with a photoreactive group like a benzophenone. Thus, we\ncan control placement of the cross-linker on MbaC and control the reactivity of the linker by irradiation with light.\nLimitations of non-specific homo-bifunctional cross-linkers were discussed in recitation #5. This answer received\npartial credit (or full-credit with follow-up experiments). Even without information about how how two proteins\ninteract, one can be specifically modified at one location (or, even better, many locations) by incorporating a site-\nspecific Cys residue by site-directed mutagenesis or UAA incorporation (e.g. benzophenone) and the cross-\nlinking experiments performed.\n2.

This question examines the role of ClpXP and\nadaptors in protein degradation during the C. crescentus cell cycle (Cell 2015, 163, 419-431).\nPrior studies revealed that the degradation of TacC and CtrA depends on a protein named CpdR that\nfunctions as an adaptor for ClpXP. CpdR functions differently from SspB, the adaptor protein we discussed in\nclass that recognizes the ssrA tag. CpdR itself does not bind a condemned protein substrate readily. Instead, it\nbinds to ClpX and effectively \"prepares\" ClpX for engagement with select substrates. Binding of CpdR to ClpX\nresults in some conformational change and formation of a \"recruitment interface\" where certain condemned\nDimorphic cell cycle of C. crescentus.\n(c) Kathleen Ryan, University of California, Berkeley.

Other biological studies have identified additional protein factors that are important for cell-\ncycle dependent protein degradation in C. crescentus; however, many mechanistic details about how these\nadditional proteins function to modulate protein degradation by ClpXP is unclear. The experiments below\nconsider one of these proteins named RcdA.\nIn experiment #1, cultures of either wild-type C. crescentus or a mutant strain were synchronized such that all\nof the cells were at the same point in the cell cycle. The mutants are rcdA (cannot express functional RcdA)\nand cpdR (cannot express functional CpdR). Equal numbers of swarmer cells were released into fresh culture\nmedium and the culture was allowed to grow. Aliquots of the culture were taken at different time points\ncorresponding to different stages in the cell cycle. The cells were lysed and the lysates were separated by SDS-\nPAGE and probed with anti-TacA, anti-CtrA, anti-McpA and anti-ClpP antibodies. TacA, CtrA, and McpA are\nproteins that are known substrates for ClpXP. The resulting data are shown in Figure 1.\nFigure 1.

The effect of CpdR and RcdA on ClpXP-catalyzed degradation of TacA was examined.\nDegradation assays were performed by combining ClpXP, ATP, TacA, and CpdR and/or RcdA, and these\nreactions were quenched various time points. TacA degradation was monitored by SDS-PAGE. The resulting\ndata are shown in Figure 2.\nNote: \"no addition\" means that CpdR and RcdA are not added. ClpXP is present.\nFigure 2.

RcdA has a disordered C-terminal\nregion and the researchers questioned whether this region of RcdA is important.\nIn experiment #4, the researchers overexpressed and purified His6-RcdA-C, a RcdA variant that lacks 19\nresidues from the C-terminus, and used this protein in studies of TacA degradation by ClpXP. The resulting data\nare shown in Figure 4.\nFigure 4. Degradation of TacA by ClpXP in the absence and presence RcdA or RcdA-C.

His6-RcdA-C and TacA were incubated alone or together with Ni-NTA resin at 4 oC for 1 hour.\nThen, the resin was transferred to a column and washed twice with buffer (20 mM HEPES, 100 mM KCl, pH 7.5)\ncontaining 20 mM imidazole.

(5 pts) Draw a cartoon of the protein degradation machine ClpXP and, based on the information provided in\nthis question, indicate how CpdR interacts with the machine. Include the oligomeric states of ClpX and ClpP in\nyour answer.\n2. (3 pts) What three amino acids compose the catalytic triad of ClpP?\nSerine, histidine and aspartic acid.\n3a. (5 pts) What do we learn from the data in Figure 1 (experiment #1) about cell-cycle dependent levels of\nTacA, CtrA, McpA and ClpP in wild-type C. crescentus?\nThe data in Figure 1 show:\nClpP The level of ClpP is relatively constant throughout the cell cycle, with slightly elevated levels at the\nG2/division stage.\nTacA TacA is most abundant in the swarmer cells (G1) and in the G2/division stage where PD, ST and SW\ncells occur. It appears that TacA expression is associated with swarmer cells.\nCtrA CtrA is detected throughout the cell cycle, and is highest during G2/division and lowest during the\ntransition between SW ST.\nMcpA This protein is most abundant in swarmer cells, and is absent in stalk cells.\nTogether, we see that there are subtle differences in cell-cycle dependent expression levels for TacA, CtrA and\nMcpA.\n\n5.08 Spring 2016 Exam 2\n3b. (5 pts) What do we learn from the data in Figure 1 (experiment #1) about the role of CpdR?\nWhen CpdR is knocked out, there is no or negligible change (i.e. reduction) in the levels of TAcA, CtrA and McpA\nat any point in the cell cycle. Thus, CpdR is required for those proteins to be degraded in the cell-cycle dependent\nmanner. (The McpA levels might be somewhat reduced at 30 min and 120 min, but some further experiments\nare needed to confirm.)\n3c. (5 pts) What do we learn from the data in Figure 1 (experiment #1) about the role of RcdA?\nWhen RcdA is knocked out, there is negligible effect on McpA levels compared to wild-type. In contrast, we see\nthat TacA and CtrA levels remain approximately constant throughout the cell cycle, which is in marked contrast\nto the wild-type. These data indicate that RcdA expression is required for cell-cycle dependent degradation of\nTacA and CtrA, but not for McpA.\n4. (5 pts) What do we learn from the data in Figure 2 (experiment #2) about the role of RcdA?\nThis experiment probes the effect of the known adaptor CpdR and RcdA on ClpXP-catalyzed degradation of\nTacA. We observe that +RcdA alone or +CpdR alone has negligible effect on the ClpXP-catalyzed degradation\nof TAcA, whereas the combination of CpdR and RcdA enhances the degradation of TacA. Thus, it appears that\nCpdR and RcdA work together to enhance the degradation of TacA.\n5a. (2 pts) Why was experiment #3 performed?\nTo determine whether the observations in Experiment #2 are specific or general towards other proteins as well.\nThis experiment also gives insight into whether CpdR and/or RcdA is an anti-adaptor for ssrA-tagged proteins\n(blocks or inhibits degradation rather than enhancing degradation).\n\n5.08 Spring 2016 Exam 2\n5b. (5 pts) What can we conclude from the data in Figure 3 (experiment #3)?\nThe combination of CpdR and RcdA has no effect on degradation of the non-native/model substrate GFP-ssrA.\nThus, they do not service all substrates destined for degradation by ClpXP, and do not block degradation of this\nssrA-tagged protein.\n6. (5 pts) From your professor's point of view, an important piece of information is missing from Figure 4. What\nis missing and why would this data be helpful in interpreting the results from experiment #4?\nIt would be helpful to see a -RcdA, +CpdR control. It is difficult to conclude whether RcdAΔC has no activity or\nlower activity than full-length RcdA without the data from the -RcdA, +CpdR control shown in conjunction.\n7. (5 pts) What do we learn from the data in Figure 5 (experiment #5)?\nTacA and RcdAΔC form a complex; thus, the 19 residues at the C-terminus of RcdA are not required for the\nformation of the complex.\n8. (5 pts) Using the information provided in this question and your analysis/interpretation of the data, provide a\nmodel for the function of RcdA in ClpXP-mediated degradation of TacA.\nCpdR is an adaptor protein that interacts with ClpX, as described in the text. RcdA forms a complex with TacA\n(independent of the RcdA C-terminus) and interacts with CpdR or ClpXP via its C-terminus. This model with the\nC-terminus of RcdA interacting with CpdR is depicted below:\nA proposal for the role of the RcdA C-terminus was required for full credit.\nEND OF EXAM\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu\n5.08J Biological Chemistry II\nSpring 2016\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: https://ocw.mit.edu/terms"

(50 points) Hepcidin is a peptide hormone that functions as the master regulator of systemic\niron that maintains the levels of the plasma concentration of iron from 10 to 30 M, despite\nfluctuations of iron in the diet. Studies predominantly on macrophages, involved in iron recycling\nfrom red blood cells, suggest that hepcidin functions by binding to Fpn extracellularly and\ntargeting it for ubiquitination intracellularly which leads to Fpn degradation by the proteosome.\nThe role of hepcidin has been postulated to be similar for iron uptake from the diet.\nVery recently the function of hepcidin was examined in enterocytes (Figure 4) using cell\nculture (Caco cells) and in mouse slices from the duodenum (small intestine). Growth conditions\nsimilar to those used in the macrophage studies were chosen after much experimentation. The\nfollowing experiments (Figure 5, 6 and 7) were carried out in cell culture with similar results in\nmouse duodenum slices. In the first set of experiments, optimized conditions (details not given),\n0.2 M hepcidin was incubated with Caco cells for 2 h and then western analysis was performed\non crude membranes subsequent to SDS PAGE analysis and electroblotting, using antibodies\nspecific for DMT1 and Fpn1. The results are shown in the western blot in Figure 5A, which was\nthen quantitated as shown in Figure 5B.\nThe results shown in Figure 5 suggested a second experiment in which Caco cells were\nincubated for one hour in the presence or absence of 50 M MG-132 (a proteasome inhibitor) and\nthen with or without hepcidin for 1 or 2 hours. Western analysis was performed on crude\nmembranes as described above with antibodies specific for DMT1 and Fpn1. The results of the\nwestern analysis is shown in Figure 6A and the quantitative analysis is shown in Figure 6B.\nThe results in Figure 6 suggested one last set of experiments shown in Figure 7. In this case\nthe experiment is a little more complex in that the Caco cells were transfected with [IRE+]-\nDMT1-eGFP construct and studied under the similar conditions described in Figures 5 and 6. In\nthis case the growth was carried out in the absence of presence of hepcidin over a 60 min time\ncourse. One additional experiment contained both hepcidin and PYR-41, an inhibitor of E1, the\nUb activating enzyme. In this case the cells were lysed and immunoprecipitation carried out with\nGFP antibodies and then analyzed by western blotting using anti-DMT1 antibodies and\nantiubiquitin antibodies.

The mechanism\nbelow was taken directly from the paper. Proton loss from 12 with or without rotation\naround the C-C bond could result in the 9-OPP or 8-OPP (trans and cis isomers). Enzymes\nin general are stereospecific and thus it would be unusual to have a general base in the\nactive site that could abstract either proton. In fact, from class with the normal substrate,\nMg-PPi is proposed to play that role. The observed products are consistent with what is\nknown about the fate of carbocations: proton loss, hydride shifts, cyclizations). The\nauthors tried to carry out rapid chemical quench studies and PPi exchange studies with 32P\nlabeled PPi to look for evidence for intermediates. All of those experiments failed so they\nturned to the use of substrate analogs. Carbocations are very unstable, so it is unlikely that\nPPi would dissociate from the active site to let the radiolabeled PPi bind. The intermediate\nwould degrade. If you are having trouble understanding the general steps in these types o\nreactions please come see me.\nb.\nGiven the types of reactions given in class that are prototypes for the\nchemistry you have described in question 1, what other product might be\nobserved if you looked harder (had higher sensitivity methods of detection)?\nWater can add to carbocations to give alcohols. Thus one might find an OH (alcohol) at any\nof the putative intermediate cations above. Two issues: 1. During the workup to look for\nother products, elimination of water could occur and 2. Water needs to get into the active\nsite. Many of you had proton losses to generate alternative olefins. This is possible and the\n(c) American Chemical Society. Davisson, V.J., T.R. Neal, and C.D.

What is a unique\nfeature of enzymes involved in making isoprenes and terpenes that distinguish these\nenzymes with most enzymatic reactions that you have learned about? (Hint, think about\nFPP)\nFPP is a substrate for many terpene cyclases as described in class. An important part of product\nformation is the shape of the active site for FPP folding and perhaps the positioning of aromatics\nto stabilize cation interactions of putative carbocation intermediates. These enzymes are in\ngeneral much more promiscuous than other enzymes.\n2. (30 points) This question was taken from J Lipid Res 49, 399 2008. HepG2 cells (liver cells)\nwere grown in delipidated serum for up to 24 h and then the cells were transferred to fresh\ndelipidated serum with 1 M lovastatin; 50 M sodium mevalonate (this concentration supplies\nthe limited amount of this metabolite required for non-isoprenoid compounds essential for cell\nsurvival) in the presence or absence of sterols for the times indicated in Figure 2. The cell\nlysates were subjected to immunoblots with polyclonal antibodies against PCSK9 (proprotein\nconvertase subtilisn/kexin type 9), low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), and sterol-\nregulatory element binding protein 2 (SREBP-2). The GAPDH protein was used as a loading\ncontrol. P and C for PCSK9 are its proprotein (intracellular) and cleaved forms (extracellular).\nA similar set of experiments in which subsequent to lovastatin induction, increasing\nconcentrations of mevalonate were examined are shown in Figure 3.\nFigure 2. Time-course expression of PCSK9 in HepG2 cells after depletion or supplementation of sterols. HepG2\ncells were grown and then switched at time 0 to delipidated serum for the indicated times with the indicated\ncomponents (lanes 1-6); similar growth conditions in delipidated serum with 1 M lovastatin and 50 M doisum\nmevalonate in the absence (lanes 7-12) or the presence (lanes 13-18) of 1 /mL cholesterol. After the indicated\nincubation times the cells were harvested, lysed and the whole cell lysates were subjected to immunoblot analysis\nwith antibodies to PCSK9 or LDLR or SREBP-2.

(3 points) In the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway, what is the rate-limiting step and what\nis the reaction catalyzed by this step (shown reactants and products)?\nThe rate limiting step is HMGCoA reductase: As noted in class the reductant is NADPH and not\nNADH\n2.\n(2 points) What is the purpose of addition of lovastatin in the experiments described\nabove and what are the expectations given its metabolic target?\nLovastatin is a competitive inhibitor of HMGCoA (they look alike) binding to HMGCoA\nreductase. Compactin is lovastatin and the lactone is the drug as it is taken more readily inot\nthe cell. On ring opening of the lactone the red parts look alike. The black part is\nhydrophobic and enhances binding. It is distinct in all the statins.\n3.\n(5 points) From recitation 8, provide the model for the role of PCSK9 in cholesterol\nhomeostasis and why this protein is of interest clinically for lowering cholesterol levels.\n(c) American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.

Hypothesis: The purple is the processed form of\nPCSK9 (pro (P) to C) that becomes extracellular. It binds to LDLR and causes it to\nedoscytose and go to the lysosome where the LDLR and PCSK9 are degraded. Thus the\nnumber of LDLRs are reduced and as a consequence the LDL levels in the plasma are\nraised.\n4.\n(4 points) In Figure 2, describe what you see from the data.\nThe data in Figure 2 and 3 were taken from J of Lipid Res 49, 399409 (2008). Lanes 1-6 with\nno sterol, no MVA, and no lovastatin; up until 12 h, the levels of SREBP-2 in the nucleus\nincrease, the LDLR levels increase (both to get more cholesterol) and the extracellular (C)\nPCSK9 levels also increase. They show parallel behavior.\nIn lanes 7-12, where there are no sterols, cholesterol biosynthesis is inhibited by lovastatin\nand MVA is at low levels, sufficient to keep cells alive; all three proteins nuclear SREBP,\nLDLR, and PCSK9 increase from 1 to 24 h. Again parallel behavior.\nIn lanes 13-18, where sterol is present, low levels of MVA are present and HMGCoA\nreductase is inhibited, all the SREBP remains in the ER as expected and the LDLR goes\naway both consistent with expectations when Ch present is present. The PCSK9 also goes\naway. The changes in the SREBP nuclear to ER movement, however, precedes the changes\nwith the other proteins. This might suggest that SREBP controls transcriptionally the levels\nof LDLR (which we know is true), but also PCSK9 which we know nothing about.\n5.\n(6 points) (In Figure 3, describe what you see from the data. Given the proposed\nfunction of PCSK9 described in recitation 8 and your answer to question 3, rationalize\nwhy the parallel observations for LDLR and PCSK9 in Figure 3 are a paradox.\nSynthesis of all three proteins are induced by lovastatin inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis.\nWith SREBP, the amounts increase with higher levels of lovastatin to 1 M. The levels of C\nform of PCSK9 increase, as do the levels of LDLR up to 1 M. These studies reveal parallel\ntrends, similar to those observed in Figure 2. The exception to the trends with all three proteins\noccurs at high concentrations of mevalonate (10 mM). Mevalonate is the product of HMGR\nwhich can be used in the biosynthetic pathway to overcome the lovastatin inhibition of HMGR.\nAn important conclusion that one can draw from the data is that both LDLR and PCKS9 are\ndependent on the presence of sterols and perhaps regulated SREBP as a TF. The paradox is that\nas the amounts of PCKS9 protein in the extracellular form (C) increase, one would expect the\nLDLR and PCKS9 to be degraded in the lysosome (model in question 3).

In fact we\nnow know that PCSK9 has a putative SRE.\n6.\n(10 points) In both Figures 2 and 3, the antibodies to SREBP-2 reveal two proteins\nlabeled P and N.\na.\nWhy are there two apparent forms of SREBP-2? SREBP resides in the ER\nmembrane when sterol levels are high.\nWhen the levels of Ch are reduced (discussed in recitation 9) the SREBP is transported\nwith SCAP to the golgi membranes where it is cleaved by two membrane located\nproteases (shown in part c). The soluble form is released to the cytosol and then is\ntranslocated to the nucleus where it functions as a transcription factor.\nb. What is the function of SREBP-2 (in a sentence describe the BIG picture)?\nSREBP-2 is a transcription factor that regulates transcription of many of the proteins\ninvolved in Ch biosynthesis and homeostasis as well as many proteins involved in fatty\nacid metabolism, phospholipid, and triacylglycerol formation.\nThis is way more information than required. All the enzymes in italics are regulated by\nthese TFs.

(50 points) Hepcidin is a peptide hormone that functions as the master regulator of systemic\niron that maintains the levels of the plasma concentration of iron from 10 to 30 M, despite\nfluctuations of iron in the diet. Studies predominantly on macrophages, involved in iron\nrecycling from red blood cells, suggest that hepcidin functions by binding to Fpn extracellularly\nand targeting it for ubiquitination intracellularly which leads to Fpn degradation by the\nproteosome. The role of hepcidin has been postulated to be similar for iron uptake from the diet.\nVery recently the function of hepcidin was examined in enterocytes (Figure 4) using cell\nculture (Caco cells) and in mouse slices from the duodenum (small intestine). Growth conditions\nsimilar to those used in the macrophage studies were chosen after much experimentation. The\nfollowing experiments (Figure 5, 6 and 7) were carried out in cell culture with similar results in\nmouse duodenum slices. In the first set of experiments, optimized conditions (details not given),\n0.2 M hepcidin was incubated with Caco cells for 2 h and then western analysis was performed\non crude membranes subsequent to SDS PAGE analysis and electroblotting, using antibodies\nspecific for DMT1 and Fpn1. The results are shown in the western blot in Figure 5A, which was\nthen quantitated as shown in Figure 5B.\nThe results shown in Figure 5 suggested a second experiment in which Caco cells were\nincubated for one hour in the presence or absence of 50 M MG-132 (a proteasome inhibitor)\nand then with or without hepcidin for 1 or 2 hours. Western analysis was performed on crude\nmembranes as described above with antibodies specific for DMT1 and Fpn1. The results of the\nwestern analysis is shown in Figure 6A and the quantitative analysis is shown in Figure 6B.\nThe results in Figure 6 suggested one last set of experiments shown in Figure 7. In this case\nthe experiment is a little more complex in that the Caco cells were transfected with [IRE+]-\nDMT1-eGFP construct and studied under the similar conditions described in Figures 5 and 6.\nIn this case the growth was carried out in the absence of presence of hepcidin over a 60 min time\ncourse. One additional experiment contained both hepcidin and PYR-41, an inhibitor of E1, the\nUb activating enzyme. In this case the cells were lysed and immunoprecipitation carried out\nwith GFP antibodies and then analyzed by western blotting using anti-DMT1 antibodies and\nantiubiquitin antibodies. The results are shown in Figure 7.\n\ntaken from class notes (answer to the left)\nFigure 4. An enterocyte found in the small intestine.

In addition you are given that Fe3+ is available from the diet. Write\nthe name and function of the two proteins. What is missing in this diagram to allow Fe3+\nto be taken into the enterocyte (assign proteins and draw the missing reaction on Figure\n4)? See the picture above next to Figure 4\n2. (5 points) Describe what you see in Figure 5. What is unusual about these observations\nrelative to the proposed universal model by which hepcidin functions derived from\nsimilar experiments on macrophages?\nThis problem was taken from Gatroenterology 2011 140, 1261 to 1271. The levels of Fpn\nincrease in the presence of hepcidin in the western in A which is quantified in B. This is the\nopposite result from the model from macrophage studies where hepcidin is given under the same\nenvironmental conditions. With DMT1, the FeII transporter, the DMT1 levels decrease in the\nwesterns in A and quantitation by B in the presence of hepcidin. (Can obtain numbers from\ngraph).\n3. (5 points) Describe what you see in Figure 6 and explain how these results provide a\npossible explanation for the results in Figure 5.\nThe addition of MG-132 (protease inhibitor) abolished the effect of hepcidin on DMT1\nabundance, that is the DMT1 is no longer degraded as observed in Figure 5. With no hepcidin,\nno effect was observed (relative to Figure 5) in the presence or absence of MG-132. Moreover\nfrom the western analysis and \"eyeball\" the FPN protein levels appear to remain unchanged\neither with or without hepcidin. As noted above, no comment on this was expected\n4.

The cells examined had DMT1 fused to GFP\nwith an IRE to make sure it was expressed in a fashion similar to the endogenous gene construct.\nThe immunoprecipitated DMT1 with the antibody to GFP (indicative of the amount of DMT1)\nand then the IP was analyzed with antibodies to Ubiquitin (and the ratio of Ub/DMT1) was\nquantitative.. As shown in C via westerns and quantified in D, hepcidin treatment of the cells\ninduced rapid Ubiquitination (time t = 0) or there was endogenous Ubiquitinaiton, followed by\nDMT1 degradation with time over time 5 to 60 min shown by the loss of signal. In addition the\nration of Ub/DMT1 tells you with time more Ub was present, indicative of targeting for\ndegradation.\nOne must have at least 4 Ubs for degradation targeting.\n5.\n(5 points). In the fifth lane in Figure 7 in the presence of PYR-41 a potent inhibitor of\nE1, explain the observed result in terms of cascade of events that appear to account for all\nthe data in this figure.\nThe experiment in the last lane of Figure 7 showed the same 60 min time point as the preceding\nlane except that PYR-41 was present. ,Now the ubiquitinated DMT1 (similar to t = 0) was not\ndegraded, but the Ub/DMT ratio decreased relative to the preceding three lanes. You were given\nthat PYR-41 inhibits the E1 activating enzyme, an essential first step in the Ub process. Thus by\ninhibiting this step, the Ubiquitination was inhibited as indicated by the lower Ub/DMT1 ratio.\nThe Ab to GFP-tagged DMT1 also shows that the protein is not degraded in the western analysis.\nYou were not required to have the cartoon shown below.\n6.\n(20 points) Both DMT1 and Fpn play important role in homeostasis in are regulated at\nthe translation level. Given the functions for these proteins draw the picture of the\nmRNA for each protein labeling the 5' and 3' ends. Show how you would expect each\nprotein to be regulated at low iron and at high iron.\nIt is clear that hepcidin has tissue specific effects, in contrast to predictions in the literature\nbased on studies with macrophages.

The authors offer a number of explanations\nfor differences in behavior in enterocytes vs macrophages. In the intestine, there may be a\nsecond form of FPN that is unable to interact with hepcidin. In fact a new FPN 1B transcript\nlacking the IRE sequence has been described in enterocytes and erythroid cells. You were not\ngiven this information. However no evidence for expression of this alternative protein form\nwas provided in the paper. With DMT1 they propose that one has increased iron absorption\ndue to stabilization of DMT1 by hepcidin in some fashion (directly? Indirectly?). The\nsignaling pathway remains to be identified. At any rate, as indicated in PS9, our simplified\nmodels are a good place to start, but all need to be tested further especially when\nunpredicted/expected results are observed.\nIn answer to the question above. Ans taken from pp notes. At low iron DMT1 should be\ntranslated so that more FeII can be taken into the cell. Thus to get additional translation, the\nmRNA is stabilized by binding of apo IRP(1 or 2) to the 3' end of the mRNA. In the case of\nFPN, the model is that it exports FeII from the cell (see Figure 4) and at low iron one might\nwant the iron to remain intracellular. Thus the translation of FPN is inhibited by binding of\napo IRP(1 or 2) to the IRE at the 5' end of the mRNA.\nMany of you were confused about the switch between high and low iron and the fact that only\nthe apo IRPs bind to the iron responsive elements (IREs). If you are having trouble you should\ncome back and talk. In a number of cases people were confused about the fact that this is\nregulation at the translational level and NOT the transcription level as we studied with SRE-BPs.\n(c) source unknown.

Recall that\nthe non-ribosomal peptide enterobactin is an iron chelator or \"siderophore\" employed by bacteria for the\nacquisition of this essential nutrient. Several natural products with structures similar to enterobactin have been\nisolated from other organisms, including Paenibacillus elgii B69. One of these siderophores is shown below\n(Environ.

The genus name Paenibacillus translates to \"almost\nBacillus\" (paene is Latin for \"almost\"), and Bacillus is a related bacterial genus. It was noted that the gene\ncluster identified for the P. elgii siderophore has many similarities to a previously identified gene cluster from\nBacillus spp., including B. anthracis, the causative agent of anthrax.

(60 pts total) In addition to the action that takes place in the decoding center of the ribosome, other\nmolecular interactions between the ribosome and various translation factors and tRNAs occur and contribute to\nthe overall translation process. A number of structural studies of the prokaryotic 70S ribosome in complex with\nother components of the translation machinery, such as tRNAs and release factors, indicate that helix 69 (H69)\nof the 23S rRNA interacts with these components. This question examines some recent pre-steady state\nkinetic studies that were performed to help address how H69 of the 23S rRNA contributes at various stages\nof the translation cycle (J. Biol. Chem. 2011, 286, 25604-25610).\nOn the basis of prior studies, the researcher studied two mutant ribosomes: a G1922A mutant and an A1913U\nmutant. The researchers used these ribosomes to study whether these mutations in H69 affect (i) tRNA\nselection and (ii) release factor selection.

Recall from\nclass and recitation discussions of the kinetic model presented in Figure 2 that conformational changes are\nrate-limiting; the rate of GTP hydrolysis (KGTP) is limited by GTPase activation (k3). Thus, the researchers\ndetermined the rate of GTP hydrolysis by EF-Tu ternary complexes as a proxy for GTPase activate in the\npresence of wild-type, G1922A, and A1913U ribosomes. The researchers observed no substantial differences\nin the rates of GTP hydrolysis for these three ribosome species and the EF-Tu!GTP!aatRNAaa complexes\nstudied. (Data not shown)\nIn experiment #2, the researchers focused on the accommodation step. Because the conformational change\nassociated with accommodation (k5) is rate limiting for peptide bond formation (kpep), the researchers monitored\npeptide bond formation as a proxy for accommodation. In this experiment, initiation complexes of wild-type and\nmutant ribosomes were prepared with fMet-tRNAfMet in the P-site and an empty A site. A synthetic mRNA with\nthe coding region AUG-XXX-UUU was employed where XXX corresponds to the triplet codon in the A site.\nSeveral different XXX codons and tRNAs were examined. The rate of dipeptide formation was monitored\nfollowing rapid mixing of the ribosomes with EF-Tu ternary complexes. The resulting data are presented in\nFigure 3.\nPanel A:\nUUU and UUC are codons for Phe.\ntRNAPhe indicates that Phe-tRNAPhe was\nemployed.\nPanels B and C:\nUGG is a codon for Trp.\nUGA is a near-cognate codon for Trp.

Recently, several additional experiments have been carried out in\nan effort to provide further support for this clustering model.\nIn one set of experiments a new method called 1H NMR metabolite scanning that\nallowed monitoring of 48 metabolites was used.

The genus\nname Paenibacillus translates to \"almost Bacillus\" (paene is Latin for \"almost\"), and Bacillus is a\nrelated bacterial genus. It was noted that the gene cluster identified for the P. elgii siderophore\nhas many similarities to a previously identified gene cluster from Bacillus spp., including B.\nanthracis, the causative agent of anthrax.

(60 pts total) In addition to the action that takes place in the decoding center of the ribosome,\nother molecular interactions between the ribosome and various translation factors and tRNAs\noccur and contribute to the overall translation process. A number of structural studies of the\nprokaryotic 70S ribosome in complex with other components of the translation machinery, such\nas tRNAs and release factors, indicate that helix 69 (H69) of the 23S rRNA interacts with these\ncomponents. This question examines some recent pre-steady state kinetic studies that were\nperformed to help address how H69 of the 23S rRNA contributes at various stages of the\ntranslation cycle (J. Biol. Chem. 2011, 286, 25604-25610).\nOn the basis of prior studies, the researcher studied two mutant ribosomes: a G1922A mutant\nand an A1913U mutant. The researchers used these ribosomes to study whether these\nmutations in H69 affect (i) tRNA selection and (ii) release factor selection.

Thus, the researchers determined the rate of GTP hydrolysis by EF-Tu ternary\ncomplexes as a proxy for GTPase activate in the presence of wild-type, G1922A, and A1913U\nribosomes. The researchers observed no substantial differences in the rates of GTP hydrolysis\nfor these three ribosome species and the EF-Tu\"GTP\"aatRNAaa complexes studied. (Data not\nshown)\nIn experiment #2, the researchers focused on the accommodation step. Because the\nconformational change associated with accommodation (k5) is rate limiting for peptide bond\nformation (kpep), the researchers monitored peptide bond formation as a proxy for\naccommodation. In this experiment, initiation complexes of wild-type and mutant ribosomes\nwere prepared with fMet-tRNAfMet in the P-site and an empty A site. A synthetic mRNA with the\ncoding region AUG-XXX-UUU was employed where XXX corresponds to the triplet codon in the\nA site. Several different XXX codons and tRNAs were examined. The rate of dipeptide formation\nwas monitored following rapid mixing of the ribosomes with EF-Tu ternary complexes. The\nresulting data are presented in Figure 3.\nPanel A:\nUUU and UUC are codons for Phe.\ntRNAPhe indicates that Phe-tRNAPhe was\nemployed.\nPanels B and C:\nUGG is a codon for Trp.\nUGA is a near-cognate codon for Trp. It is also a stop codon.\nTrp-tRNATrp-24/27/59 is a miscoding tRNA that can\naccommodate certain near-cognate triplet codons.\nFigure 3. Effect of H69 mutations on tRNA accommodation.

Recall that RF1 and RF2 are release factors that recognize various stop codons in\nthe A site and catalyze peptide release. In this experiment, the researchers prepared ribosome\ncomplexes where [35S]-fMet-tRNAfMet was in the P-site. The synthetic mRNA contained AUG\nXXX-UUU where XXX is a stop codon (UAA, UAG, UGA). The ribosomes were rapidly mixed\nwith saturating amounts of RF1 or RF2 and the rate of peptide release (krel) was monitored\nusing the 35S radiolabel. The resulting data are presented in Figure 5.\n\n5.08 Spring 2015 Final Exam\n(c) American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.

Therefore, it seems like H69 of the 23S rRNA is not important for activating GTP\nhydrolysis by EF-Tu.\n(e) (20 pts) What do the data from experiments #2 and #3 (Figure 3 and 4) tell you? Be sure\nto address the data provided in all panels in your answer.\nPanel 3A - the A1913U and G1922A mutations have negligible effect on peptide bond\nformation, hence accommodation, for the Phe-tRNAPhe and its 2 cognate codons examined\nhere.\nPanel 3B - the A1913U and G1922A mutations have negligible effect on peptide bond\nformation, hence accommodation, for Trp-tRNATrp and its cognate codon UGG or a mutant Trp\ntRNATrp that decodes missense (STOP) codons.\nPanel 3C - the A1913U mutation prevents the mutant Trp-tRNATrp from miscoding - the tRNA\ncannot accommodate with the STOP codon in the A site when A1914U is present. The G1922A\nmutation causes some decrease in miscoding, but to a much lesser extent than A1913A.\nPanels 4A and 4B - these data show that the A1913U mutation blocks accommodation select\ncases - for select tRNA/codon pairs. Curiously, it appears that an A in the wobble position\nresults in this effect.\n\n5.08 Spring 2015 Final Exam\n(f) (10 pts) What do the data from experiment #4 (Figure 5) tell you?\n-Mutation of A1913 has negligible effect on peptide release (krel) mediated by RF1 (UAA or\nUAG) or RF2 (UAA or UGA).\n-The consequences of G1922 mutation depend on the release factor and STOP codon.\n(g) (5 pts) Taking the observations from experiments 1-4 together, briefly describe how H69\ncontributes to the translation cycle.\nH69 contributes at different points in the translation cycle, and different regions of H69\ncontribute at different stages. The data for A1913 suggest that the loop region is important for\naccommodation of certain tRNA when specific triplet codons are in the A site. The data for\nG1922 suggest that the stem region is important for recognition of the UGA TOP codon by RF2.\n\nProblem 3 (20 points): In eucaryotes, deubiquitinases (DUBs) remove ubiquitin\nconjugates from a diverse range of protein substrates altering their stability, localization\nand activity. One of the deubiquitinases named USP19 is involved in deubiquitinating\nPCNA, the sliding clamp and processivity factor that plays a crucial role in DNA replication\nand repair. USP19 is a protease that hydrolyzes amide linkages and has an essential\ncysteine in its active site. Two assays have been developed to monitor the activity of USP19\nusing two artificial substrates Ub-CONH-Ub (diUb) and UbCONH-AFC (Figure 1A). In the\nfirst assay the reaction can be monitored by SDS-PAGE and Commassie blue staining (B)\nand in the second assay the AFC released is fluorescent(C).\n(c) source unknown.

The protein PCNA is monitored by SDS PAGE and western blotting\nusing an antibody to PCNA.\nAn hypothesis has recently been put forth that an essential response to oxidative stress\nwhich results in DNA damage is the control of the ubiquitination state of PCNA. Several\nexperiments have recently been reported in an effort to understand how this regulation\noccurs. First the assays in Figure 1A were used to monitor the activity of DUB (USP19)\nthought to be important in the deubiquitination of PCNA. The results are shown in Figure\n1 B and C as are the effects of H2O2 and DTT (dithiothreitol, structure in the Appendix I) on\nthe activity of USP19.\n1.

(6 points) What do the data in Figure 6 B and C tell you?\nFigure 1B shows that diUb is converted to Ub in the control in a time-dependent fashion\nusing SDS PAGE to monitor the reaction, but in the presence of H2O2 NO reaction occurs.\nThus H2O2 appears to inactivate the DUB.\nUsing the assay with fluorophore release, the DUB is also inactivated with H2O2. However,\nin the presence of DTT (a reagent that can reduce a sulfenic acid to cys, to activity is greatly\nincreased approaching that of the control.\n3.

The pathway branches from IMP to\nproduce GMP and AMP, each pathway involving two steps (Eq 1 for IMP to GMP).

Recently, several additional experiments have been carried out in\nan effort to provide further support for this clustering model.\nIn one set of experiments a new method called 1H NMR metabolite scanning that\nallowed monitoring of 48 metabolites was used. The differences in some of the\nintracellular purine levels in the two growth conditions is shown in Figure 1.\n\n5.08 Spring 2015 Final Exam\nFigure 1 Relative abundance of intracellular purines in 1H NMR metabolite scanning in HeLa cells cultured\nin purine-depleted and purine-replete medium.

Show with chemical\nstructures the basis for its instability.\nThe decomposition involves anomerization and hydrolysis. The mechanism I am showing has\nbeen established. Some of you used oxocarbenium ion loss of ammonia.\nv (5 points) Fluorescence microscopy and fluorescently tagged enzymes played an important\nrole in the proposed importance of the purinosome and its assembly and disassembly. Several\nnew types of experiments described in the Figures above were pursued to further support the\nimportance of enzyme clustering in cells. In the results shown in Figures 1, 2A and 2B, describe\nin one sentence each, three observations from the data that support the Benkovic model.\n(Figure 1)HeLa cells comparing purine starved vs replete cells show elevated levels of AMP and\nIMP. In addition a lower level of hypoxanthine was observed. In purine depleted cells the\n\n5.08 Spring 2015 Final Exam\nsalvage pathway using hypoxanthine/guanine phosphoribosyl transferase could kick in. You\nwere not required to know this, but you could say what you saw. In addition the downstream\ncatabolic intermediates adenosine, guanosine and inosine are also higher in purine depleted cells.\nIn Figure 2A and B, AMP and GMP are made by two independent pathways from IMP. The\nresults form the 15N glycine incorporation experiments show that cells cultured under purine\ndepleted conditions in the first hour that the AMP, GMP and IMP rates of de novo biosynthesis\nare about 70% higher. The observed increase in de novo purine biosynthesis suggested that\nenzymes downstream of IMP biosynthesis might be found in the purinosome. These results thus\nled to the experiments shown in Figure 3. The elevate levels of AMP/IMP and their increased\nrates of production under purine depleted conditions, both suggest that purine biosynthesis is\nenhanced.\nvi (5 points) In one sentence describe the data in Figure 3 a through c. In a second sentence\ndescribe how these data support or refute the model.\nFluorescence imaging studies were thus perfomed using the purinosome marker FGAM\nsynthetase in transiently transfected HeLa cells. The GMP synthetase appears to co-cluster with\nFGAMS as shown by the yellow color of the merge data. Many of you commented on the low\nfluorescent background. This is seen in all the papers you read. Both a and b show the typical\npurinosome type punctate staining you have seen before. Thus GMP synthetase is also added to\nthe purinosome protein clusters by these studies.\nvii (5 points) Figure 4 reports the results of the western analysis of Hela cells grown under\npurine replete or depleted media. In one sentence describe what you see. In a second sentence\ndescribe why the results of this experiment may be important relative to the data in Figures 1,\n2A and 2B.\nThe western analysis was carried out to see if the enzyme expression levels are up-regulated to\nmeet the requirement for activation of the pathway seen in Figure 1 and Figure 2A and B.\nEndogenous levels of the purine enzymes were examined. No significant difference in\nexpression levels were observed. Thus the \"clustering\" appears to be important supporting the\nBenkovic model.\nviii (5 points) Comment on the clustering proposal (purinosome formation) and its advantages\nin metabolic pathway control.\nThe advantage of clustering of many copies of the enzymes in the purine pathway in metabolic\nflux, still remains to be established. A recent paper suggests that clustering similar to what is\nreported on the purinosome, accelerates processing of intermediates, at least in human cells (see\nNat Biotech 32, 1011- 1018 (2014)). An advantage that all agree on is that if an intermediate in\nthe pathway is a branch point for a second pathway, then channeling can have an advantage due\nto sequestration. This same Nat Biotech paper just cited, carries out experiments on the\npyrimidine/arginine biosynthetic pathway and shows this to be true. Finally, as noted in class,\nmany of the intermediates in the purine biosynthetic pathway are \"unstable\". PRA has a half\nlife of 10 s at 37 C. The question is whether this unstable enough to effect flux? The answer is\n\n5.08 Spring 2015 Final Exam\nstill being debated. Many of you said you if you are clustered you do not need to find the next\npathway enzyme. While this is true diffusion in the cell of both small molecules and proteins is\nfast. It depends on the concentrations of the proteins with which these small molecules interact\nand whether they bind \"non-specifically\" to other proteins and slow down the diffusion\nprocess.\nProblem 5 (25 points) Staphyloccus aureus is a pathogenic organism that has the ability\nto colonize in almost all tissues in humans. Resistance of these organisms to current\nantibiotics has engendered an outcry for new strategies and targets for antibiotic\ndevelopment. Iron is essential for this organism and it has evolved many ingenious ways to\nacquire it from all kinds of environments. Nutrient limitation has thus become of interest\nas a potential new way to limit the organism's viability.\n1 (5 points) Draw a clearly labeled cartoon (no chemical structures required) of the\npeptidoglycan and plasma membrane of a gram positive organism using S. aureus as a\nmodel. In this cartoon, clearly show two major mechanisms that this organism has evolved\n(using circles and squares to define protein structures) to acquire iron. Show the oxidation\nstate of the iron and the organic molecules to which it is bound (again, the detailed\nchemical structure is not required).\n(c) Subramanian, Karthik. \"Cd163-Mediated Innate Immune Response(s) to Cell-Free Hemoglobin.\" PhD Thesis, August, 2013.\nThis content is excluded from our Creative Commons license.

(8 points) There are now known to be > 500 siderophores that bacteria synthesize as\none way to tackle the problem of iron acquisition. S. aureus makes two distinct\nsiderophores, the structure of one, staphyloferrin A (Fe-SA), is shown in Figure 1.\nB\n(c) Subramanian, Karthik. \"Cd163-Mediated Innate Immune Response(s) to Cell-Free Hemoglobin.\" PhD Thesis, August, 2013.\nThis content is excluded from our Creative Commons license.

Genes and their organization for the biosynthetic\n(staABC) and uptake (htsABC) pathway for staphyloferrin A . In addition, FhuA, an ATPase, is required for the\nHts machinery to function.\nRecently the structure of the HtsA in complex with iron-staphyloferrin (Fe-SA) was obtained and\nis shown in Figure 2. In the structure of HtsA, the N-terminal 35 amino acids were removed\nwhich contains Cys at residue 22 that is attached to a farnesyl group (think about terpene\nbiosynthesis) which anchors the protein to the plasma membrane. The binding constant (Kd) of\nthe Fe-SA to HstA was determined using a fluorescence titration method. The experiments\nwere carried out on 15 nM HtsA in 50 mM Hepes (pH 7.4) with the excitation wavelength set at\n280 nm and the emission wavelength set at 334 nm. The concentration of the Fe-SA was varied\nfrom 0.22 to 260 nM. Using this method, the Kd for Fe-SA binding to HtsA was reported to be\nat or below the low nM range.\ni. (4 points) Explain the basis for the fluorescence assay and what limits its successful use.\nThe change in fluorescence is associated with binding of Fe-SA to the protein which has a W\nwhose properties are such that its fluorescence is quenched on binding of this small molecule.\nMany of you got fluorescence titration experiments confused with FRET experiments and were\nattaching fluorophores to both SA-Fe and HtsA. The key to the fluorescence titration method is\nthat upon titration, either the binder or protein undergoes a change in fluorescence. In this\nproblem the change in fluorescence is associated with W in HstA. Sensitivity is always an issue\nwith this method, so if the dissociation constant for SA-Fe to HtsA is tight and you must use low\nconcentrations of protein to measure the actually Kd, then you may not be able to make the\nmeasurement as the single to monitor the bound/free ratio is too low.\nii. (4 points) Given the available information, can a Kd be measured? Why or why not?\nWhile you were not given very much information, you were told that the titration used 15 nM\nHtsA and that the Kd for SA-F binding to HstA was low nM. Since you must be able to\nmeasure [SA-F] free you, you would need to go lower in protein concentration than 15 nM. The\nquestion is can one still observe a change in fluorescence during the titration. In the\nconcentration range used for SA-F, it is likely that you are measuring stoichiometric binding and\nanother method would be required to measure the actual Kd. The concentrations of SA-F in\n\n5.08 Spring 2015 Final Exam\ngeneral should be 0.2 to 5 x Kd. This rule of thumb is the same for measuring the Km for an\nenzymatic reaction.\n(c) American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.

The first structure of a gram positive siderophore binding protein, lipoprotein, HtsA.\nTo further understand the interaction of Fe-SA with HtsA, mutants of HtsA were generated\nand an exact gene replacement was carried out to make new S. aureus strains. Each strain\nwas studied for 55Fe uptake and cell growth. In cells treated with 100 nM 55Fe-SA and in\nthe case of growth assays, Fe-SA is the sole source of iron. Finally, in one strain glutamates\nat 110 and 250 were replaced with Ala.

What does the data in Figure 3A and 3B tell you?\nThe mutants that drastically lower 55Fe uptake and growth are in general the same. They\ninclude R104, R126 and R306. In Figure 2 you see that these residues all likely are key to\n\n5.08 Spring 2015 Final Exam\nbinding of Fe to SA. Thus the results in general show that altered binding of Fe to HstA,\nalters iron uptake and growth. Other things are going on as well which many of you\ncommented on, but the results indicated above all correlate and provide an interesting\npicture.\nii. What is the oxidation state of the iron bound to SA? What oxidation state of iron would\nfacilitate release from SA in the cytosol? Why?\nThe oxidation state is +3. Release of iron from SA would thus be enhanced by reduction to\nthe +2 state where the ligands are more exchange labile.\n5. (5 points) i. What are three reductive metabolites of O2 that are designated as reactive\noxygen species (ROS)?\nHO-, superoxide and hydrogen peroxide\nii. Which of the three is most reactive and how is \"reactivity\" judged?\nHO- is the most reactive as judged by its rate constant of 1010 M-1s-1 with glutathione\nProblem 6 (15 points). Enterocytes are the only cell type that must balance the de novo\nsynthesis and absorption of cholesterol and the coordination of these processes in these cells has\nonly recently (2014) been investigated. Studies on the two isoforms of Insig (Insig1 and Insig2)\nhave been limited because of functional redundancy and neonatal lethality. Enterocytes have\nthree sources of cholesterol: two that are shared by other cell types including the liver. To study\ncholesterol homeostasis in enterocytes, investigators generated mice with the intestine-specific\ndeletion of Insig1 using Villin-Cre method in combination with germ line deletion method of\nInsig2 (details not important). The mice with the double deletion are designated Vil-Insig- mice\nand are used in the studies described below. Recall that hepcidin (the master regulator of\ncholesterol homoesostasis) is made in the liver which functions as a major organ for cholesterol\nhomeostasis.\nIn Figure 1 the investigators measured the protein levels of SREBP1, SREBP2 and HMGR\n(HMGCoA reductase) and the mRNA levels of a variety of proteins involved in lipogenic\npathways.\n\n5.08 Spring 2015 Final Exam\n(c) American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.

Control and Vil-Insig- mice (17 to 19 weeks of age, 7 mice) were injected intraperitoneally with\n50 millicuries of 3H2O. One hour later tissues were removed and processed for isolation of digitonin\nprecipitable sterols (A, C) and fatty acids (B, D). The small intestine was divided into three equal length\nsegments termed promimal (prox), middle (mid), and distal (dist). The sterol and fatty acid synthetic rates\nwere calculated as micromoles of 3H incorporated/h per g (A and B) or per organ (C and D) between the\ncontrol and the Vil-Insig- mice.\nQuestions (15 points)\ni.\n(3 points) Enterocytes are unusual in the regulation of whole-body sterol flux in\nthat they have three sources of cholesterol. What are they?\nj.\nCholesterol uptake from the diet.\nCholesterol uptake by receptor mediated endocytosis\nCholesterol bioysynthesis\nii. (4 points) Succinctly describe the results in Figure 1 and what they tell you.\nMany of you did not write down what you observed in the data and relate it to your\nunderstanding of the function of Insig. In Figure 1A protein levels of HMGR are massively\noverexpressed relative to the control. The levels of the two transcription factors SRE-BP1\nand 2 are also over expressed relative to the control with most of the protein, especially in\nthe case of SRE-BP1 found in the nucleus. This is what you would expect for both sets of\nproteins as Insig in the presence of cholesterol binds to the steroid sensing domain of Scap\nand HMGR and prevents it from in the former case moving to the nucleus from the ER and\nin the latter case, targets it for degradation. Both mechanisms have massively failed in the\nknockout mice. The mRNA levels (Figure 1B) are much less dramatic. HMGR mRNA is\nstrickingly not all that different from the control. Interesingly, as discussed in the overview\npicture on cholesterol homeostasis, SRE-BPs are involved in regulating both sterol\nbiosynthesis (HMGS, FPPS) and Fatty acid biosynthesis (FAS). Thus far the data supports\nthe role of Insig you learned about, although the data appears extreme in the case of the\nproteins.\n3. (4 points) Succinctly describe the results in Figure 2 and what they tell you.\nIn Figure 2 you are looking at the amounts and rates of synthesis of sterols (A and C) and\nfatty acids (B and D). In the case of the sterols Insig knockouts caused massive changes in\n\n5.08 Spring 2015 Final Exam\nthe sterol levels in both cases. These results are distinct from the liver, but recall that the\nliver Insigs have not been knocked out. The data on fatty acid biosynthesis are less\ndramatic, but still prevalent. In all cases the fatty acid levels in the intestinal parts are\nelevated. All of this data point to the importance of Insig in controlling TF which regulate\nsterol and fatty acid biosynthesis. How this relates to uptake in these cells from the diet is\nalso of great interest, but you have not been given enough information.\n4. (4 points) From the data in Figures 1 and 2, do Insigs function in the enterocyte in the\nsame fashion as other cells? What is (are) their major function? Be succinct.\nAs noted above Insigs control movement of the SRE-BP ultimately to the nucleus by\nkeeping the protein in the ER through Scap when high levels of Cholesterol are present.\nTheir absence caused HMGR levels to go out of control. The enzyme continues to make Ch\ndespite intake from the diet. Similar, the role of Insig in HMGR degradation has also been\nlost. Thus superficially the same levels of control are apparent. The interesting\nobservations relate to the levels of sterols and fatty acids. These results require further\nstudies. Unfortunately one cannot knock out essential genes without causing other\nchanges as well.\nINSIGS are essential for feedback regulation in the intestine.\nAppendix I\n(c) source unknown.
