  "syllabus_content": "Course Meeting Times\n\nSeminars: 1 session / week; 3 hrs / session\n\nPrerequisites\n\nNone\n\nCourse Description\n\nWe began this class four years ago focused on water and climate change. There was only one class on this topic at that time in the world! In 2018, we expanded our focus to include health, both human health and planetary health. Realizing that all people are vulnerable to climate change and all regions are impacted, we added health to emphasize the life-affirming aspects and hope inherent in a cooperative and solutions-based approach to climate change.\n\nClimate science is comprised of a huge diversity of disciplines: physics, chemistry, biology, paleoclimatology, astronomy, geology, meteorology, oceanography, glaciology, and more! We will take an Earth Systems approach in order to establish a solid climate science foundation. The first two months will be devoted to covering fundamental concepts, so that we are all on common ground.\n\nMIT exposes us to multiple disciplines. Water, Climate Change, and Health requires not only multi-disciplinary (within academia) but also transdisciplinary (beyond academia) perspectives that include equity and justice, which is to say concern for vulnerable people and other life on Earth. For example, we focus on people and specific locales where waterborne and vector-borne diseases, hunger, malnutrition, and poverty are exacerbated by climate change--challenges that will worsen with increased temperatures, precipitation, flooding, drought, overcrowding, and displacement. These factors are top causes of morbidity and mortality due to climate change. At the same time, we recognize that we are all on this planet together, so all life on Earth is vulnerable to climate change impacts.\n\nThese challenges are also opportunities for creativity and innovation. The intersection of water, climate change, and health is a call for action. Responses and actions today, as in no other time in Earth's recorded history, affect our human and planetary future.\n\nWith this awareness and seriousness of purpose, our class will include a Term Project of your choice, as well as numerous lectures, tutorials, class discussions, demos, games, and field trips. We will explore solutions though real-world engagements. Presentations by water, climate, and health experts, innovators, and climate activists will offer stimuli for teams to co-create solutions. Co-creation is a\nMIT D-Lab\nsignature approach to engagement and international development.\n\nField trips get us out of the classroom and into the world. We will visit the Blue Hill Meteorological Observatory and learn about its history, its MIT alumnus founder, continuous temperature records extending back to the 19th century, and its historic instrumentation still in use together with modern instrumentation. Next, we will visit some of the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority's storm-water management sites, including the Charles River dam and some combined sewer overflows. Our third field trip will be to the town of Hull, which produces 10% of the town electricity needs, the equivalent of 1,100 homes and all of the traffic lights. It does so through Hull Wind 1--a 150-foot tall structure with a 0.66-megawatt generating capacity--which is the first of two wind turbines, and Hull Wind 2 installed in 2006 in a different part of town. Our final field trip will be to Susan's home to see, in action, a home-based solar electric, solar thermal, and geothermal system. All of these field trips will enrich our appreciation of water's role in ecosystem function and climate science, adaptation, mitigation, and transformation opportunities.\n\nWe welcome students of all ages, nationalities, religions, and gender orientations, both undergraduate and graduate, from MIT and beyond MIT. We are excited to engage with you in co-creating a meaningful and memorable class this spring 2019!\n\nCourse Highlights\n\nProject-based, experiential learning and close mentoring\n\nTransdisciplinary approaches\n\nHuman and planetary health foci\n\nCo-creation principles applied in designing Term Project solutions\n\nSeminars, discussions & guest lectures\n\nSelected water/climate/health film series offered on selected nights (optional attendance, bring your dinner!)\n\nField trips to local water/climate change/health sites: e.g. Blue Hill Meteorological Observatory, MWRA storm water management infrastructure, Hull Wind energy system, City Nature Challenge, and a low-carbon home visit\n\nTextbooks\n\nHawken, Paul. ed.\nDrawdown: The Most Comprehensive Plan Ever Proposed to Reverse Global Warming.\nPenguin Books, New York, 2017.

Participation includes regular attendance and engagement in the assignments, active involvement in class discussions, group exercises, and teamwork. Class participation also includes completing assignments on-time and being ontime to class. Students missing a class are asked to inform the instructors. Attendance at field trips during class time is required. Attendance at field trips during non-class time is optional, but strongly encouraged.\n\nTutorial\n\nThe tutorial is an opportunity to pick a topic of your choice from the universe of topics pertaining to the subjects of water, climate change, and health and share that with the class. The tutorial will be undertaken either with one teammate, or individually. It can be done in any format of your choice, with creative, non-traditional pedagogies (eg. demos, games, workshops, or other activities) most welcome.\n\nTerm Project\n\nIn teams or individually, students will develop small- or global-scale term projects on water, climate change, and health solutions. You and your team decide on the format--a model, a video, a website, an app, a proposal, an artistic expression, a research paper, a competition entry. This can take any form. Each person or team will receive close mentoring as projects evolve. Every class project will have three deliverables, one per month of the term. There will be opportunities to present your term projects and get feedback from the class and/or mentors in varying stages of project evolution.\n\nD-Lab Showcase\n\nThe D-Lab Showcase will feature all the spring term D-Lab class projects. Mark your calendars! This is a required event! It will be an opportunity to present the \"final\" version of your Term Project. Course instructors and peers will provide feedback on your work.\n\nExtra Credit\n\nStudents will receive a feedback on their second and third deliverables (see\nCalendar\n). After receiving their third deliverable feedback, students will have an opportunity for students to further develop their work for extra credit and hand it in one final time. There is no final exam in this course.",

Why/why not?\n- What other concerns are there which\nremain unaddressed or insufficiently\naddressed?\n- Why have vulture populations continued\nto decline at 30-70% per year?\n- What challenges/ international\nimplications does the use of NSAIDS in\nlivestock present in India? In Africa?\nGlobally?\n\nPART A\n- What value do vultures bring to the\nsubcontinental ecosystems?\n- Besides a virus, what could be killing\nvultures?\n- What other steps should the teams\ntake to discern the cause of the\nvultures' decline?\n\nPART B\n- What are the challenges to reducing\nthe vultures' exposure to diclofenac?\n- What strategies should be used to\nkeep vulture populations at ecologically\nfunctional levels in the subcontinent?\n- What are some possible solutions to\nthe crisis?\n\nCASE STORY\n- By 2007 ,India had lost 97% of its vultures\n- Dead and dying vultures- collapsed from trees\n- India, Pakistan, Nepal and Now Europe\n- Their absence has affected many sectors, including human health, the\nfertilizer production industry, water provision, and waste management.\n- Losing vultures has cost India an estimated 34 billion dollars in damages\n((RSBP) 2013).\n- Contaminated by residual pharmacologic agent given to livestock\n- Diclofenac-NSAID-highly effective, low cost\n- Widely used in humans- pain /arthritis and animals\n\nTHEMES\n- Use of Diclofenac: NSAID: What is the pharmacology, use, mechanism of action of\nthis drug and other NSAID and effects/long and short term\n- Elimination of the vulture and consequences\n- Obligate scavengers\n- Cultural and religious implications: Vultures culturally respected in India-Hinduism-\nto the level of a god, Parsee religion- disposition of dead bodies\n- Keystone species: Provides a valuable ecosystem service- consuming dead animals:\nThe estimated 100 million plus vultures living in India in the 1990s consumed\napproximately 20 million tons of carrion each year ((SAVE) 2016\n- Carcass clean up of bones for fertilizer use\n- Stakeholders: governments, conservation groups, drug companies, religious groups,\nfertilizer companies\n- Scientific evidence to affect conservation efforts and policy implications\n\nTHEMES CONTINUED\n- The potential impacts: water and sanitation concerns, dog bites, and increased rat populations.\n-\nVultures are not affected by anthrax due to their specialized digestive systems, and their speedy\nconsumption of carcasses reduces the opportunity for anthrax bacteria to sporulate and contaminate\nthe environment (Pain et al. 2003).\n- Feral dog and rat populations increased, begun taking over carcass dumps in the absence of vultures .\nIncreased numbers of feral dogs and rats represented potential problems in rabies and bubonic\nplague control. These human health risks amplified the importance of India's vultures to the human\necosystem, in addition to their role in the larger ecosystem.\n- In 2014, the World Health Organization reported that 36% of all rabies cases globally occurred in\nIndia alone, or 18-20,000 deaths from rabies\n- Political and legal changes, as well as effective enforcement of any new laws.\n- August 2006, manufacture of diclofenac for veterinary use was formally banned by the Drug\nController General of India\n- Compliance-still available for human use\n\nEXAMPLES OF ID THREATS OF ONE\nHEALTH SIGNIFICANCE\n\nPLAGUE IN MADAGASCAR\nImage is in the public domain.\n\nSALMONELLA\nINFECTIONS\nLINKED WITH\nMARADOL PAPAYAS\nHIT 23 STATES\nCourtesy of wuestenigel on Flickr Used under CC BY..\n\nMARBURG VIRUS\nIN UGANDA\nCourtesy of CDC/Frederick Murphy.

(MORE DETAIL)\nLarge sphere= all water on earth (1.4 Billion km3). Medium sphere = freshwater on\nearth (11 Million km3) . Small sphere = surface fresh water on earth (93,000 km3).\n-\nLarge sphere: represents all the water on earth - in\noceans, ice caps, lakes, rivers, groundwater, the\natmosphere, and living things. It has a diameter of\nabout 860 miles. That 860-mile-high sphere is the\nlargest bubble in the picture, which stretches from\nSalt Lake City, Utah to Topeka, Kan. It has a volume of\nover 332 million cubic miles.\n-\nThe 2nd, smaller blue sphere, over Kentucky - is\nabout 170 miles in diameter. It represents the world's\nliquid freshwater, including groundwater, lakes,\nswamp water, and rivers. However, 99 percent of that\nsphere is groundwater, much of which is not\naccessible to humans.\n-\nThe smallest sphere, represents the freshwater, all\nthe lakes and rivers on the planet. Most of the water\nthat people and ecosystems use every day comes\nfrom these surface-water sources. The diameter of\nthis sphere is a mere 34.9 miles, with a volume of a\nlittle over 22,000 cubic miles.\n(c) Howard Perlman, Hydrologist, USGS, Jack Cook, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, Adam Nieman,\nIgor Shiklamonov.

Crust thickens\nand forms tectonic plates.\nPlates edges pushed up or\nunder other plates, melting\nmagma, which again erupts.\nLiebes Sidney et al., A Walk Through Time, 1998.\nhttp://www.differencebetween.net/science/differ\nences-between-the-earths-lithosphere-and-\nasthenosphere/\nThis work has been released into the public domain by its author, Booyabazooka at English Wikipedia.\n\nCrust\n-The Earth's crust ranges from\n5-70 kilometres (3.1-43.5 mi)\nin depth and is the outermost\nlayer. The thin parts are the\noceanic crust, which underlie\nthe ocean basins (5-10 km)\nand are composed of dense\n(mafic) iron magnesium\nsilicate igneous rocks, like\nbasalt.\nCourtesLJ of EA^A. /mage is in the pudlic domain.\n\nhttp://www.differencebetween.net/science/differences-between-the-earths-lithosphere-and-asthenosphere/\nLithosphere\nAsthenosphere\nThe lithosphere concept was proposed in 1911\nThe asthenosphere concept was proposed in 1926\nLithosphere is composed of the crust and upper most solid\nmantle\nAsthenosphere is composed of the upper most weaker part\nof the mantle\nLies beneath the atmosphere and above the asthenosphere Lies beneath the lithosphere and above the mesosphere\nThe physical structure consists of a rigid outer layer that is\ndivided by tectonic plates.

As the earth cools the\nsteam condenses into rain. Rain forms rivers and pours into seas. As\nthe seas form, the surface water evaporates into clouds under the\nSun's heat, creating a cycle of weather driven by solar energy.\n- Later, living systems take an active role in the weather cycle. H2S gas,\nproduced by plankton, rises into the atmosphere. The molecules of\nthis gas form nuclei that attract water molecules and form raindrops.\nThus plankton seed the clouds.\n- Humans, huge consumers of plankton, keep it in check. But humans\nkill whales, while at the same time chemical runoff into the sea feed\nhuge blooms of new ocean plankton.\nLiebes Sidney et al., A Walk Through Time, 1998.\n\nWater is a Vital Component of the Climate Cycle\nOceans contain over 97% of Earth's water, 2% is in glacial ice, less than 1% in all the rest of Earth's reservoirs.\nThe hydrologic cycle, the continual recycling of water among all these reservoirs, including much smaller amounts cycling\nin the atmosphere, in plants, in lakes, in rivers, and in soil, is vital to the operation of the climate system.\nCourtesy of USGS.

The science shows that these\nnine processes and systems regulate the stability and resilience of the Earth System -- the interactions of land, ocean, atmosphere and life that together\nprovide conditions upon which our societies depend.\nFour of nine planetary boundaries have now been crossed as a result of human activity: climate change, loss of biosphere integrity, land-system change,\naltered biogeochemical cycles (nitrogen and phosphorus).\nhttp://www.stockholmresilience.org/research/planetary-boundaries/planetary-boundaries/about-the-research/the-nine-planetary-boundaries.html\n(c) AAAS.

The control variables have been normalized for the zone of uncertainty (between the two red\ncircles); the center of the figure therefore does not represent values of zero for the control variables. The control variable shown for climate change is\natmospheric carbon dioxide concentration. The term novel entities represents the growing awareness that, in addition to toxic synthetic substances, other\npotentially systemic global risks exist, such as the release of radioactive materials or nanomaterials. Processes for which global-level boundaries cannot yet\nbe quantified are represented by grey wedges; these are atmospheric aerosol loading, novel entities, and the functional role of biosphere integrity.\nhttp://www.stockholmresilience.org/research/planetary-boundaries/planetary-boundaries/about-the-research/the-nine-planetary-boundaries.html\n(c) AAAS.

This has resulted in a substantial and largely irreversible loss in the diversity of life on Earth.\n- The changes to ecosystems have contributed to substantial net gains in human well-being and economic\ndevelopment, but these gains have been achieved at growing costs in the form of the degradation of many\necosystem services, increased risks of nonlinear changes, and the exacerbation of poverty for some groups of\npeople. These problems, unless addressed, will substantially diminish the benefits that future generations obtain\nfrom ecosystems.\n- The degradation of ecosystem services could grow significantly worse during the first half of this century.\n- The challenge of reversing the degradation of ecosystem while meeting increasing demands for services can be\npartially met under some scenarios considered by the MA, but will involve significant changes in policies,\ninstitutions and practices that are not currently under way. Many options exist to conserve or enhance specific\necosystem services in ways that reduce negative trade-offs or that provide positive synergies with other\necosystem services.\n- The bottom line of the MA findings has been that human actions are depleting Earth's natural capital, putting such\nstrain on the environment, that the ability of the planet's ecosystems to sustain future generations can no longer\nbe taken for granted. At the same time, the assessment shows that with appropriate actions it is possible to\nreverse the degradation of many ecosystem services over the next 50 years, but the changes in policy and practice\nrequired are substantial and not currently underway.\nhttps://www.millenniumassessment.org/en/index.html\n\nLand System Change\n- Land is converted to human use all over the planet. Forests, grasslands, wetlands\nand other vegetation types have primarily been converted to agricultural land.\n- This land-use change is one driving force behind the serious reductions in\nbiodiversity, and it has impacts on water flows and on the biogeochemical cycling\nof carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus and other important elements.\n- While each incident of land cover change occurs on a local scale, the aggregated\nimpacts can have consequences for Earth system processes on a global scale.\n- A boundary for human changes to land systems needs to reflect not just the\nabsolute quantity of land, but also its function, quality and spatial distribution.\n- Forests play a particularly important role in controlling the linked dynamics of\nland use and climate, and is the focus of the boundary for land system change\nhttps://www.stockholmresilience.org/research/planetary-boundaries/planetary-boundaries/about-the-\nresearch/the-nine-planetary-boundaries.html\n\nBiogeochemical - Nitrogen & Phosphorus\n- The biogeochemical cycles of nitrogen and phosphorus have been radically changed by humans as\na result of many industrial and agricultural processes.\n- Nitrogen and phosphorus are both essential elements for plant growth, so fertilizer production\nand application is the main concern.\n- Human activities now convert more atmospheric nitrogen into reactive forms than all of the\nEarth's terrestrial processes combined. Much of this new reactive nitrogen is emitted to the\natmosphere in various forms rather than taken up by crops.\n- When it is rained out, it pollutes waterways and coastal zones or accumulates in the terrestrial\nbiosphere.\n- A significant fraction of the applied nitrogen and phosphorus makes its way to the sea, and can\npush marine and aquatic systems across ecological thresholds of their own.\nhttps://www.stockholmresilience.org/research/planetary-boundaries/planetary-boundaries/about-the-\nresearch/the-nine-planetary-boundaries.html\n\nDead zone - Gulf of Mexico \"Largest ever\nmeasured.\" Size of New Jersey\nDead zones are\nhypoxic (low-\noxygen) areas in the\nworld's oceans and\nlarge lakes, caused\nby excessive\nnutrient pollution\nfrom human\nactivities coupled\nwith other factors\nthat deplete the\noxygen required to\nsupport most\nmarine life in\nbottom and near-\nbottom water.\nTop: Courtesy of NASA.\nBottom: Courtesy of LSU/LUMCON and NOAA.\nImages are in the public domain.\n\nComparing Gases on Venus, Earth and Mars\n0.04\nCourtesy of NASA.

Water\nvapor will reach the upper areas of the atmosphere where it would be\nphoto-dissociated by starlight or sunlight and hydrogen would escape\nto space, with oxygen and other molecules and surface minerals\nthereby getting rid of the planet's oceans. We think that's what\nhappened to Venus.\"\n\nWhat Makes a Planet Habitable?\nQuoted from Prof. Sara Seager - see reference slide\n\"What Happened to Mars?: On the outer edge of the habitable zone,\nactually the gases that we are worried about, our greenhouse gases,\nwould freeze out, water and carbon dioxide, making the planet too cold\nfor liquid water and too cold for life as we know it. We think that's, in\npart, what happened to Mars.\"\n\nCourtesy of US EPA. Image is in the public domain.\nEarth's Radiation Budget: Solar radiation arriving at the top of Earth's atmosphere averages 340 W/m2 , indicated here as 100% (upper left). About 30% of the\nincoming radiation is reflected and scattered back to space, and the other 238 W/m2 (70%) enters the climate system. Some of this entering radiation warms Earth's\nsurface and causes it to radiate heat upward (right). The greenhouse effect (lower right) retains 95% of the heat radiated back from Earth's heated surface and\nwarms Earth by 318C.\n1,362 W/m2\nShort wave\n(visible)\nGreenhouse gases, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxides, CFCs,\nothers, act as a blanket, trapping the sun's energy.\n\nRadiation Balance\n- Almost all of the energy that affects Earth's climate is received as radiant energy\nfrom the Sun. The planet and its atmosphere absorb and reflect some of the\nenergy, while long-wave energy is radiated back into space. The balance between\nabsorbed and radiated energy determines the average global temperature.\nBecause the atmosphere absorbs some of the re-radiated long-wave energy, the\nplanet is warmer than it would be in the absence of the atmosphere: (see\ngreenhouse effect).\n- The radiation balance is altered by such factors as the intensity of solar energy,\nreflectivity of clouds or gases, absorption by various greenhouse gases or surfaces\nand heat emission by various materials. Any such alteration is a radiative forcing,\nand changes the balance. This happens continuously as sunlight hits the surface,\nclouds and aerosols form, the concentrations of atmospheric gases vary and\nseasons alter the groundcover.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiative_forcing\n\nSpectra of Major Greenhouse Gases\nhttp://learningweather.psu.edu/node/22\n(click on \"Absorbtivity Graphic\" link)\n1 m = 106 micron\nUltraviolet (10 nm - 0.4 Î¼) Visible (0.4 - 0.7 Î¼)\nInfrared (0.7 Î¼ - 1000 Î¼\nImage courtesy of The Pennsylvania State University.\nUsed under CC-BY-NC-SA.\n\nText for Howard et al, 1959 slide only (Slide 10):\nReference: http://www.meteor.iastate.edu/gccourse/forcing/spectrum.html\n- For each gas is given a plot of the absorption of the gas, ranging from 0 to 1, for each wavelength.\n- As an example, if we look at the plot for oxygen and ozone, we see that the absorption is very high in the ultraviolet\nregion but essentially zero in the visible and infrared regions, except for isolated peaks. We interpret this to mean\nthat this gas absorbs essentially all radiation in the ultraviolet but is transparent in the visible and mostly\ntransparent in infrared portions of the spectrum. This gas then is responsible for shielding earth-based biological\nsystems from lethal ultraviolet radiation, radiation with wavelengths less than 0.3 micrometers (or 300\nnanometers), but allows visible light and infrared radiation to pass through without much absorption.\n- Other gases have much different absorption properties. Methane (CH4), for example, has a couple of very small\nwavelength regions in which it absorbs strongly and these occur at about 3.5 and 8 microns, which are in the\ninfrared region. Nitrous oxide, N2O, having peaks at about 5 and 8 microns, absorbs in fairly narrow wavelength\nranges.\n- Carbon dioxide has a more complex absorption spectrum with isolated peaks at about 2.6 and 4 microns and a\nshoulder, or complete blockout, of infrared radiation beyond about 13 microns. From this we see that carbon\ndioxide is a very strong absorber of infrared radiation. The plot for water vapor shows an absorption spectrum more\ncomplex even than carbon dioxide, with numerous broad peaks in the infrared region between 0.8 and 10 microns.\n- The total spectrum of all atmospheric gases is given in the bottom plot. This shows a \"window\" between 0.3 and 0.8\nmicrons (the visible window), which allows solar radiation (without the lethal UV component) to reach the earth's\nsurface. \"Earth radiation\", the upwelling infrared radiation emitted by the earth's surface, has a maximum near 10\nmicrons. The total atmosphere plot shows that a narrow window (except for an oxygen spike) exists in the range of\nwavelengths near 10 microns.\n- Note: The CFCs are not plotted here but will be considered separately.\n\nAbsorption Patterns of Water Vapor and CO2\nImage courtesy of NASA.

His measuring device, which used\nthermopile technology, is an early landmark in the history of absorption\nspectroscopy of gases.\n- He was the first [or 2nd if credit goes to Eunice Foote] to correctly\nmeasure the relative infrared absorptive powers of the gases nitrogen,\noxygen, water vapour, carbon dioxide, ozone, methane, in the 1859\n(four years after Eunice Foote's work).\n- He concluded that water vapor is the strongest absorber of radiant heat\nin the atmosphere and is the principal gas controlling air temperature.\nAbsorption by the other gases is not negligible but relatively small.\n- Prior to Tyndall it was widely surmised that the Earth's atmosphere has\na Greenhouse Effect, but he was considered to be the first to prove it.\nThe proof was that water vapor strongly absorbed infrared radiation.\n- [Eunice Newton Foote's experimental work is only recently discovered].\nImage courtesy of the Smithsonian.
