Calculators may be used when necessary.\nPlease answer the questions directly on the exam pages. If you require more room, use the\nbacks of the facing pages.\nThere are four questions on this examination, and each is worth 25 points. Apportion your time\naccordingly.\nKeep your answers short and to the point. When appropriate, include sufficient information to\nindicate your reasoning. This will enable us to award appropriate credit even if you do not answer\nthe question completely.\nGood luck!\nPlease write your name here\n\n~\n1. When equilibrated at high temperatures, f.c.c. magnesium oxide (MgO) will have equal\nnumbers of negatively charged cation vacancies and positively charged anion vacancies uni\nformly distributed throughout the material. By answering the questions below, describe what\nwill happen to the equilibrium cation and anion vacancy distributions if an MgO crystal is\nplaced in a uniform electric field. Assume that the total numbers of both kinds of vacancies\nremains constant.\n(a) Write the general equations for the coupled forces and fluxes in this problem. Note any\nconstraints on the coefficients in your equations.\nSolution: Assume that the electrostatic forces on the vacancies are equal to q∇φ = qE\nwhere q = ±2e. There will also be a diffusive force from any gradients of chemical\npotential. Vacancies and their associated charge move together. The flux equations for\nthe cation and anion vacancies will be\nJ\nJc = Lcc∇(μc + 2eφ) + Lca∇(μa -2eφ)\n(1)\na = Lac∇(μc + 2eφ) + Laa∇(μa -2eφ)\n(2)\nFrom Onsager's symmetry principle, Lca = Lac.\n(b) What is an appropriate diffusion potential for the species in this problem? Explain how\nthe diffusion potential could be used to characterize the steady state that would be\nobtained by annealing in an electric field for a very long time.\nSolution. The diffusion potential must account for the combined effects of concentra\ntion gradients and electrical potential gradients. It will have the form shown in KoM\nEq. 3.47, i.e., for cations it will be μc + 2eφ and for anions it will be μa -2eφ. At\nequilibrium, the diffusion potential for each species must be uniform. This will result\nin a nonuniform distribution of anions and cations when the crystal is in an electric\nfield.\n2. Interdiffusion in Au-Ni alloys occurs by the vacancy mechanism, and the intrinsic diffu\nsivity of Au is always larger than that of Ni in this system. At 900*C, the interdiffusivity\ndrops by about two orders of magnitude on going from pure Au to pure Ni. Suppose a one-\ndimensional diffusion couple was made up consisting of pure Au on the left and pure Ni on\nthe right and that inert markers were placed at the interface prior to any interdiffusion. Then\nthe diffusion couple was heated at 900*C for a long time to allow significant interdiffusion\nto occur.\n(a) Draw a schematic diagram illustrating the expected shape of the concentration of Ni\nvs. distance across the interdiffusion zone. Justify the shape of the curve you have\ndrawn.\nSolution: Au is on the left side of the couple and because Au has the higher intrinsic\ndiffusivity, Au will penetrate more rapidly into the Ni side and the concentration profile\nthere will have shallower slope compared to the case where intrinsic diffusivities are\n\n(\nequal. Because Ni has the lower intrinsic diffusivity, Ni will penetrate less rapidly into\nthe Au side and the concentration profile there will have steeper slope compared to the\ncase where intrinsic diffusivities are equal.\n% Ni\nDistance\nAu\nNi\nFigure 1: Au-Ni interdiffusion profile (schematic).\n(b) Which way would the inert markers placed at the original interface move as a result of\nthe interdiffusion? By what mechanism would they move?\nSolution: Au diffuses faster to the right than nickel diffuses to the left. Inert markers\nplaced at the interface will appear to move to the left end of the diffusion couple.\nAssuming diffusion by the vacancy mechanism, there will be a net vacancy flux to the\nleft. Vacancy sources to the right of the interface lead to \"negative climb\" of edge\ndislocations, corresponding to net deposition of material on the right (Ni) side of the\ninterface, and vacancy sinks operate on the left (Au) side, corresponding to erosion of\natomic planes by dislocation climb.\n(c) The lattice constants of Au and Ni are about 0.4 and 0.36 nm, respectively (both ele\nments are f.c.c. and there is continuous solid solubility at 900*C). Would you expect\nthe resulting atomic size difference to contribute to the marker motion? Explain your\nreasoning.\nSolution: Au moving faster to the right means that its larger atomic volume will be\ntransported to the right as well. This will contribute to marker motion to the left, in\nexcess of that which would arise if the atomic volumes were equal.\n3. Consider a finite body 0 ≤x ≤10 μm with these initial and boundary conditions:\nc(x, t = 0)\n=\nc0,\n1 ≤x ≤2 μm\n0,\nx < 1 and x > 2 μm\n(3)\nJ(x = 0, t) = J(x = 10 μm, t) = 0\n(4)\nAssume a constant value of the interdiffusivity, D = 10-16 m2/s.\n(a) Superpose on a plot the initial concentration vs. distance profile and that which would\nbe present at time t = inf.\n\n!\n\n\"\n#\n\"\n#\nSolution: Because of the zero-flux boundary conditions at each end, the amount of so\nlute in the system must remain constant. The steady-state concentration is thus uniform\nand equal to the average concentration present at t = 0, ⟨c⟩= 0.1 c0.\nc0\nt = 0\nt =\n0.1 c0\nDistance, μm\nFigure 2: Diffusion in a finite body: initial and final conditions.\n(b) Indicate how you would go about finding a solution for the time dependence of the re\nsulting composition profile that would be valid for all times. Note: You should write\ndown a few explanatory equations, but do not take time to work out the complete solu\ntion unless you have finished the remainder of the exam.\nSolution: Because the system geometry is finite, use separation of variables to solve\nthe problem exactly. Note that the boundary conditions and symmetry of the problem\nindicate that the correct periodic extension of the initial profile will be an even function\nof x and thus the series need only contain cosine terms. Assuming c0 = 1, it will have\nthe form\ninf\n\nX\njπx\nj2π2Dt\nc(x, t) = 0.1 +\nBj cos\n10 × 10-6\nexp\n-(10 × 10-6)2\n(5)\nj=1\nwith the Fourier coefficients Bj given by\nZ 2×10-6\njπx\nBj =\ncos\ndx\n(6)\n×\n10-6\n1×10-6\n10 × 10-6\n(c) Write down an approximate solution that will be valid for relatively \"short\" times by\nsuperposing two error-function solutions. Estimate the time interval over which you\ncould be confident in using this solution.\nSolution: Here the system could be modeled as a finite slab of initial concentration c0\nembedded between two semi-infinite pieces with initial concentration 0, and using the\nsuperposition of error-function solutions illustrated in KoM Fig. 4.4. Taking the \"steps\"\nto be at 1 μm and 2 μm the resulting expression is\nc0\nx -(1 × 10-6)\nc0\nx -(2 × 10-6)\nc(x, t) =\nerf\n- 2 erf\n√\n4Dt\n√\n4Dt\n(7)\n\nThe solution will be valid only until the concentration begins to build up at x = 0\nbecause this approximation does not obey the zero-flux boundary condition there. The\ntime for this would be approximately t ≈(1.5 μm)2/4D ≈6000 s.\n(d) Another approximate solution could be obtained by using a single point source at x =\n1.5 μm and a second \"image\" source at x = -1.5 μm. Would such a solution have\nany advantages over the error-function solution method suggested in part (c) above?\nWould it have any disadvantages?\nSolution. The replacement of finite source with an point source and its image at x =\n-1.5 μm would give an approximate solution that would be valid out to times governed\nby the breakdown of the zero-flux boundary condition at x = 10 μm. This would\noccur approximately at t ≈(8.5 μm)2/4D ≈200, 000 s. Note that this approximate\nsolution would not be good at short times (less than about 6000 s, the approximation in\npart (c) would be better at capturing the \"flat\" top of the initial profile at 1.5 μm).\n4. Please identify which of the following statements is true or false. Give a brief justification\nfor each answer. Full credit requires concise, correct reasoning.\n(a) As consequence of the principle that local entropy production is nonnegative, the inter\ndiffusivity in binary alloys must be a positive quantity.\nSolution. FALSE. The mobility that relates flux to gradient of chemical potential must\nbe positive, but the interdiffusivity may be negative because of the thermodynamic\nfactor in KoM Eq. 3.13.\n(b) For steady-state diffusion through a one-dimensional thin sheet with fixed concentra\ntions at each end, the c(x) profile inside the sheet could be concave up, linear, or con\ncave down.\nSolution. TRUE. The diffusivity may be concentration dependent, causing the profile\nto be non-linear. Whether D increases or decreases with c determines the sign of the\ncurvature of c(x). Only if diffusivity is independent of concentration will c(x) be linear.\n(c) For all crystalline materials it is possible to express the diffusion flux by the relation\nJ~ = -D∇c where the diffusivity D is a diagonal tensor (i.e., such that Dij = Dji = 0\nwhen i = j).\nSolution. TRUE. The diffusivity is generally a symmetric second-rank tensor. Such\ntensors have real eigenvalues and eigenvectors and there is always a principal axis\nsystem in which the tensor description is diagonal. Note that in low-symmetry crystal\nsystems (monoclinic and triclinic), these principal axes will generally not coincide with\nthe conventional crystallographic axes.\n\n(d) The vacancy diffusivity in a pure crystalline material, DV , can be modeled by the rela\ntion DV = Γr2f/6, with the correlation factor f = 1.\nSolution. TRUE. Vacancy diffusion in a pure material is uncorrelated. The vacancy\ndiffusivity in a three dimensional crystal is given by this expression, with f = 1."

Consider an oxygen-deficient oxide MO3-x that contains a low concentration of solute aris\ning from the addition of the soluble oxide AO2. Assume that oxygen diffusion occurs by a\nvacancy mechanism.\n(a) Write the reduction reaction for reducing MO3-x and a corresponding equation for its\nequilibrium constant Keq.\nSolution: In a reduction reaction, oxygen will be liberated as a gas by giving up elec\ntrons which will reduce the charge on nearby cations. The liberated anion leaves an\nanion vacancy. The reduction reaction will have the form:\nM + V--\nM + O×\n2M×\nO = 2M′\nO +\nO2\n(1)\nThe corresponding equilibrium constant will be\n-ΔG/(kT) = [M′\n[V-- ] P 1/2\nKeq = e\nM]2\nO\nO2\n(2)\n(b) Write a defect reaction for the incorporation of the solute A into MO3.\nSolution. M is hexavalent, A is tetravalent. Assume that A substitutes for M on cation\nsites. A reasonable incorporation reaction is:\nAO2 → A′′\nO + V--\nM + 2O×\n(3)\nO\n(c) Write the charge neutrality condition for the impure, nonstoichiometric oxide.\nSolution. Assume Schottky defects to be the dominant intrinsic defects in MO3. The\ncharged species present will be cation vacancies, anion vacancies, impurity cations,\nand M ions that have captured one electron. The resulting charge neutrality condition\nis\nM′\nA′′\nV′′′′′′ ] = 2 [V--\n[\nM] + 2 [\nM] + 6 [\n(4)\nM\nO ]\n(d) Explain under what conditions it might be possible to use MO3 as the active component\nin an oxygen sensor.\nSolution. The reduction reaction equilibrium constant depends on oxygen partial pres\nsure, so an oxygen sensor must take advantage of the reduction regime. In this regime,\nit might be possible to relate electrical conductivity from the M′\nM defects to oxygen\npartial pressure. To operate in this regime, the crystal must be sufficiently pure or the\ntemperature must be high enough to avoid the extrinsic regime associated with any im\npurities. Also, the temperature must be sufficiently low to avoid the intrinsic regime.\nNote that reduction is favored at low oxygen partial pressures.\n2. Harrison's \"B regime\" of short-circuit grain-boundary diffusion is illustrated in Fig. 1.\nConsider a volume element in the boundary of dimensions δ × dy × dz as shown in Fig. 2b.\nBy relating the accumulation in the volume element to the fluxes into each of the six faces of\n\nthe volume element, show that the differential equation governing this regime has the general\nform\nB\n∂cXL\n∂cB\n∂2c\n= A\n+ B\n(5)\n∂t\n∂y2\n∂x\nYou do not have to evaluate the constants A and B in your derivation.\nSee Kinetics of Materials, Figure 9.4b, p. 215\nFigure 1: \"B regime\" of Short-Circuit Grain-Boundary Diffusion.\n\na\ndz\ndy\n(b)\n(a)\nSee Kinetics of Materials\nFigure 9.8 , p. 218\nFigure 2: (a) Model Geometry for Diffusion Along a Grain Boundary. (b) Volume Element for\nDescription of Short-Circuit Grain-Boundary Diffusion.\nSolution: Assume that the concentration field is independent of z and that the concentration\nin the boundary cB is independent of x. Consider the fluxes into and out of the volume ele\nment. Along the y-direction, material enters the volume element from the top and leaves at\nthe bottom as solute is transported down the boundary. If the flux at the top of the volume\nelement is Jy, at the bottom it will be Jy + dJy/dy dy. The contribution to the accumulation\nB\nin the volume element from flow along y will be dJy/dy = DB∂2cy /∂y2 The volume ele\nment will lose solute because of diffusion out of the grain boundary into the grain, and the\naccumulation will therefore be affected by diffusion into the grains along ±x. The flux out\nof the boundary in the x direction is determined by the concentration gradient in the grain\nadjacent to the boundary, i.e. for x > 0 the flux will be Jx = -DXLdcXL/dx and for x < 0\nthe flux will be Jx = -DXLdcXL/dx as well. The total accumulation in the volume element\nwill be\n∂cB\n∂Jy\ndy dz δ = -\ndy dz δ - Jxdy dz\n(6)\n∂t\n∂y\nor\nB\nDXL ∂cXL\n∂cB\n∂2c\n= DB\n-\n(7)\n∂t\n∂y2\nδ\n∂x\nwhich has the desired form of Eq. 5.\n3. The Gibbs-Thomson equation can be written in the form\nβ\nβ\nμB(P β) - μB(P α) = 2ΩBγ\n(8)\nr\n\n(a) Explain the meaning of each quantity in this equation and give SI units for each quantity.\nβ\nSolution: μB(P β) is the chemical potential of B atoms in the β phase at pressure P β ,\nβ\nm\nand units are J/atom. μB(P α) is the chemical potential of B atoms in the β phase at\npressure P α, and units are J/atom. ΩB is the atomic volume of species B, and units are\n3 . γ is the excess free energy per unit area of an α/β interface, and units are J/m . r\nis the radius of a spherical particle of β phase, with units of m.\nThe Gibbs-Thomson equation indicates how the chemical potential of a species in a\ntwo-phase system at equilibrium changes with curvature of the α/β interface. For\na spherical fluid solution with a spherical particle of β in an α matrix, the equation\nindicates how μB changes with r, compared to a system in which the α/β interface is\nflat.\n(b) Explain the relevance of the Gibbs-Thomson equation to the phenomenon of particle\ncoarsening (Ostwald ripening).\nSolution: Ostwald ripening occurs in a two-phase system consisting of a matrix phase\nand particles of an embedded second phase. The Gibbs-Thomson equation indicates\nthat the solubility of solute in the matrix phase will depend on particle radius such\nthat the solubility in a system with small particles will be greater that that in a system\nwith particles having larger radii. Assuming local equilibrium at the particle/matrix\ninterfaces in a system with a distribution of particle radii, concentration gradients result\nin the matrix phase such that solute will diffuse from small particles to large particles.\nThis results in a gradual shift of the particle size distribution to larger sizes.\n(c) The accompanying figure shows coarsening data from Hardy and Voorhees' experiments on\nsemi-solid Pb-Sn alloys. In what way are the data consistent with a prediction of the mean-\nfield theory of particle coarsening? In what way are the data inconsistent with the mean-field\ntheory?\nSee Kinetics of Materials, Figure 15.9, p. 372\nFigure 3: Coarsening Data on Semi-Solid Pb-Sn Alloys (Hardy and Voorhees 1988).\nSolution. The plot is effectively ⟨R⟩3 vs. t and the data for each volume fraction fall on a\nstraight line. Hence the results are consistent with the \"t-to-the-one-third\" law prediction of\nthe mean-field theory. However, the mean-field theory does not consider a particle volume\nfraction effect (in fact, it is strictly valid in the limit of zero volume fraction of particles),\nbut the data clearly show that the rate constant for coarsening is an increasing function of\nparticle volume fraction.\n\n4. Please identify which of the following statements is true or false. Give a brief justification\nfor each answer. Full credit requires concise, correct reasoning.\n(a) In KCl containing MgCl2, there will be an intrinsic regime of cation diffusion in which\nthe cation vacancy concentration is independent of temperature.\nSolution. FALSE. The intrinsic regime will have a defect population that obeys an\nArrhenius law. In this impure material the extrinsic regime will have a cation defect\npopulation that is independent of temperature.\n(b) The activation volume for self-diffusion in metallic glasses is near zero, indicating that\nself-diffusion likely takes by a cooperative many-body process.\nSolution. TRUE. The activation volume is determined from the pressure dependence of\nthe diffusivity. The very small activation volume observed in self-diffusion in metallic\nglasses indicates that defects like vacancies or interstitials that have excess volume\nlikely do not play a role in diffusion. A cooperative process is consistent with a very\nsmall activation volume.\n(c) The theory of random walks can be used to model self-diffusion in a polymer melt.\nSolution. TRUE. The reptation model for self-diffusion in a long-chain polymer melt\ninvolves the concept of reptation time during which a given polymer molecule remains\nattached to its primitive tube. During one reptation time interval the molecule's center\nof mass executes a random walk related to the root mean square end-to-end length of\nthe molecule.\n(d) Single-phase interfaces tend to migrate toward their center of curvature.\nSolution. TRUE. Motion of an interface normal to itself results in an area change\nif the interface has non-zero mean curvature. Migration toward the center of (mean)\ncurvature guarantees that the interface area will decrease."

When appropriate, include sufficient information to\nindicate your reasoning. This will enable us to award appropriate credit even if you do not answer\nthe question completely.\nGood luck!\nPlease write your name here\n\n1. Figure 1 is a transmission electron micrograph of the transformation morphology observed\nwhen an ordered FeAl crystal with the CsCl structure is cooled into a miscibility gap and\ntransformed there. The micrograph is a dark-field image using a superlattice reflection, so\nthat bright regions are ordered and higher in Al content, and dark regions are disordered and\nlower in Al content. The long curved dark line is an antiphase boundary, and can be ignored\nin this problem.\n0.25 μm\nFigure 1: Microstructure in phase separated Fe-24 at.% Al alloy.\n(a) Considering the morphology and characteristic length scale of the microstructure, the\nlikely mechanism of phase separation is spinodal decomposition. Why is it somewhat\nsurprising that this alloy transforms by spinodal decomposition?\nSolution. The customary view that crystalline solutions will \"order\" or \"phase separate\"\nbased on the near-neighbor bond preferences would make one believe that ordering and\nspinodal decomposition are \"opposite\" sorts of behavior and in a given system the sign\nof the enthalpy of mixing would determine if a system would order (A-B bonds pre-\nferred) or phase separate (A-A and B-B bonds favored). In the Bragg-Williams model\nwe studied, we found that the sign of the parameter W (Ω in the regular solution model)\ndetermined the behavior. With this oversimplified picture, it is indeed surprising that\nan Fe-Al alloy with CsCl order would be unstable with respect to spinodal decompo-\nsition. (The Bragg-Williams model will give this behavior under certain conditions if\nboth first and second neighbor interactions are considered.)\n(b) Measurements of elastic constants in Fe-Al alloy single crystals show them to be highly\nelastically anisotropic. Considering the observed microstructure and your knowledge\nof spinodal decomposition, why is this surprising?\nSolution. The morphology of spinodal decomposition in crystalline materials is largely\ndetermined by the elastic energy term 2α2Y and in most alloys the elastic constant\nc\nY varies with crystallographic orientation of the wave vector of decomposition, β.\nComposition waves tend to grow fastest along elastically soft directions in elastically\nanisotropic alloys. Given that Fe-Al alloy elastic constants are highly anisotropic, the\nphase separated microstructure should be strongly aligned as in KoM Fig. 18.13(b).\n\nThe unaligned spinodal structure observed in the figure would be expected for decom-\nposition in an alloy that is elastically isotropic, or one that has very little change of\nlattice constant with composition.\n(c) Measurements of the lattice constants of Fe-Al alloys over a range of compositions\nand temperatures show that the lattice constant increases with Al content in disordered\nalloys and that increasing long-range order actually decreases the lattice constant. Ex-\nplain how this might explain the observed phase separated morphology in the micro-\ngraph.\nSolution. The nonaligned morphology observed could result if the phase separated\nstructure can form with essentially no change of lattice constant between the phases.\nThe disordered phase has the lowest aluminum content and the lattice constant is\nsmaller the lower the aluminum content. The ordered phase has the highest aluminum\ncontent and presumably a high degree of order. Although the lattice constant increases\nwith composition in the disordered phase, ordering lowers the lattice constant, so it is\nlikely that the system evolves the fields η(r) and c(r) in such a way to eliminate signifi-\ncant variation of lattice constant with composition in the two-phase mixture (disordered\n+ ordered).\n, γ\n2. An orthorhombic crystal has three orthogonal low-energy surface orientations with val-\nγ\nues of excess free energy per unit area of γ100 = 500 mJ/m2\n= 300 mJ/m2, and\n001 = 100 mJ/m2. Assume that a fully-facetted critical nucleus forms with these interface\norientations.\n(a) Demonstrate that the shape of the critical nucleus will obey the relation\nγ100\nγ010\nγ001\n=\n=\n(1)\nX\nY\nZ\nwhere X, Y , and Z are the distances of the (100), (010), and (001) faces from the\ncenter of the critical nucleus, respectively.\nSolution. Write an expression for ∆G for forming the brick-shaped particle with edge\nlengths x, y, and z:\n∆G = xyz∆gB + γ100 yz + +γ010 zx + γ001 xy\n(2)\nDetermine the equilibrium shape by minimizing with respect to x, y, and z:\n∂∆G = yz∆gB + γ010 z + γ001 y\n(3)\n∂x\n∂∆G = xz∆gB + γ100 z + γ001 x\n(4)\n∂y\n∂∆G = xy∆gB + γ100 y + γ010 x\n(5)\n∂z\nSetting these derivatives equal to zero and denoting the critical sizes as xc = X, yc =\nY , and zc = Z gives the desired relation\nγ100\nγ010\nγ001\n=\n=\n= -∆gB\n(6)\nX\nY\nZ\n\n(b) The shape of this critical nucleus is very different from a sphere which has the minimum\nsurface area per unit volume enclosed. Rationalize the facetted shape of the critical\nnucleus in this case in terms of the surface energy anisotropy.\nSolution. A spherical shape will have smaller surface area than the fully-facetted brick-\nshaped particle of equivalent volume. Even though the brick has a larger surface area,\nthe total surface free energy is made low by forming the critical nucleus with its largest\nfaces in the orientation with the lowest surface free energy (i.e., (001) faces) and with\nits smallest faces in the orientation with the highest surface free energy (i.e., (100)\nfaces).\n3. Please identify which of the following statements is true or false. Give a brief justification\nfor each answer. Full credit requires concise, correct reasoning.\n(a) \"Barrierless nucleation\" of the β phase on α/α grain boundaries can occur when the\ninterfacial energies are such that γα/α ≥ 2γα/β .\nSolution. TRUE. When this condition is met the high-energy α/α grain boundary can\nbe completely eliminated when the β phase forms on the boundary, as the energy of\nthe two α/β interfaces that are formed by wetting will be less than the grain bound-\nary energy. Without an interfacial energy barrier, there will be no energetic barrier to\nnucleation.\n(b) A molten binary alloy may become constitutionally supercooled if the thermal gradient\nin the liquid ahead of the solid/liquid interface is sufficiently steep.\nSolution. FALSE. Steep gradients in temperature actually stabilize the interface and\npromote \"plane front\" solidification. The thermal gradient must be sufficiently shallow\nin order to get constitutional supercooling (in which the actual temperature in the liquid\nfalls below the temperature of the liquidus for the liquid's local composition).\n(c) Antiphase boundaries are the most conspicuous microstructural feature in a material that\nhas undergone a continuous ordering transformation.\nSolution. TRUE. Continuous ordering occurs very rapidly and the main feature in the\nmicrostructure will be the APBs which are a special type of stacking fault between\nout-of-registry ordered domains. The characteristic length scale that evolves during\nordering is that of the antiphase domains. The motion of these interfaces is capillarity\ndriven and the kinetics are given by a solution to the Allen-Cahn equation.\n(d) The time-cone method of describing transformation kinetics can be used to predict the\ngrain size in a devitrified glass, knowing the grain nucleation rate J and the growth rate\nR .\nSolution. TRUE. The number of grains at the completion of the transformation is equal\nto the number of nucleation events that occur. The number of nuclei is given by the\nproduct of the nucleation rate J and the time-cone volume."

Effects of electical potential, capillarity, and stress on diffusion potential.\nReferences\n1. Balluffi, Allen, and Carter, Kinetics of Materials, Sections 3.2-3.5.\nKey Concepts\n- Interdiffusion may be conveniently described in a crystal frame (C-frame) attached to an inert marker\nplaced inside the diffusion zone, or in a volume-fixed frame (V-frame, also known as a laboratory\nframe).\n- In the C-frame description of interdiffusion in a two-component system, Fick's law is expressed for\neach component and each component has its own intrinsic diffusivity. In general the fluxes of each\ncomponent are not equal in the C-frame.\n- The intrinsic diffusivity of a component diffusing in a concentration gradient is related to that compo-\nnent's self-diffusivity by an appropriate thermodynamic factor (see KoM Eq. 3.13).\n- In the V -frame description of interdiffusion in a two-component system Fick's law is expressed in\nterms of a single diffusivity known as the interdiffusivity.\n- When two interdiffusing species have the same atomic volumes, the interdiffusivity and the intrinsic\ndiffusivities are related by eD = X1D2 + X2D1 (KoM Eq. 3.26).\n- In general, the intrinsic diffusivities and the interdiffusivity are all functions of concentration.\n- The Kirkendall effect refers to a set of phenomena that arise when interdiffusing species move at\ndifferent rates. In a substitutional alloy this requires vacancy creation and destruction. These processes\ncan take place quite efficiently provided the material contains sufficient numbers of vacancy sources\nand sinks. However, it is not unusual to find Kirkendall porosity on one side of the interdiffusion zone.\n- The mobility Mi that relates the diffusive flux of i to its chemical potential gradient is always posi\ntive. Diffusivities are usually positive also, but not always. For instance, inside the spinodal where\n∂2G/∂c2 < 0, D < 0.\n- The diffusion potential Φi for species i can have terms arising from concentration gradients (inter\ndiffusion), gradients in electrical potential (e.g., ionic conduction and electromigration), thermal gra\ndients, capillarity (e.g., surface smoothing), and stress (e.g., diffusional creep).

The product\nγ(K1 + K2) is the driving force for capillarity-induced interfacial motion, equal to the energy change\nper unit volume swept out by the interface as it moves.\n*\n- The diffusion potential for a species i at a curved surface is ΦS = μi + γκΩi.\ni\n- KoM Fig. 3.7 illustrates the variation of chemical at the surface of an undulating surface and the\ndirection of the resulting diffusion fluxes. As shown in the text, the local equilibrium concentration of\nvacancies depends on surface curvature (see Eq. 3.74) and the resulting fluxes determine the rate of\nsurface smoothing.\n- Stresses in solids can affect diffusion in a variety of ways, including via the mobility, its effect on\ndiffusion potential, and via influencing the boundary conditions for diffusion.\n- Even a uniform state of stress may break symmetry and cause jumps in certain directions in the\nmaterial to be favored and modify the mobility (see KoM Eq. 3.78).\n- For a crystal in a state of hydrostatic stress a \"misfitting\" solute atom with an excess atomic volume\nΔΩ1 will require work against pressure when it moves and causes a concentration change. This work\nis dw = -PΔΩ1dc1 and the resulting diffusion potential is Φ1 = μ1 + ΔΩ1P.\n- In an alloy crystal in a state of nonuniform stress the solute concentration field will also be nonuniform\nat equilibrium in order to make the diffusion potential uniform. KoM Fig. 3.8 illustrates an edge\ndislocation and its hydrostatic stress field is given by Eq. 3.80. Such defects are common in real\ncrystals and their interactions with solute atoms has profound effects on mechanical behavior.\nRelated Exercises in Kinetics of Materials\nReview Exercise 3.8, pp. 72-73."
