      "content": "Department of Materials Science and Engineering\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\n3.044 Materials Processing - Spring 2013\nProblem Set 1\nProblem 1\nYou are planning to investigate a new, weakly-doped graphite material as a potential\nsuperconductor. To see superconductive behavior, you must cool it to near absolute zero. To\nachieve this, you drop a single crystal cube of your graphite material into a liquid helium bath,\nheld at 3K. Let us investigate the cooling of your sample.\nGraphite is a hexagonal material. At your starting temperature of 300K, the thermal conductivity\nof graphite along any direction within the basal plane is 72 W/mK, and along the c-axis, it is 1.53\nW/mK. At the final temperature of 3K, the thermal conductivity of graphite along any direction\nwithin the basal plane is 0.014 W/mK, and along the c-axis, it is 0.0056 W/mK (source for k\ndata: G.A. Slack. \"Anisotropic thermal conductivity of pyrolytic graphite.\" Phys. Rev. 127,\n1962). The z-axis of your cube is aligned with the c-axis of the crystal.\ni.\nWrite an expression for the thermal conductivity in each direction as a function of\ntemperature. You may have to make some assumptions about k.\nii.\nDerive the conduction equation in 3D for graphite.\niii.\nUnder what conditions is this a 3D conduction problem? 2D? 1D?\niv.\nSolve for the temperature profile as a function of time, making any justifiable\napproximations.\nv.\nCan you explain why graphite is a better conductor within the basal plane than along\nits c-axis?\nThe structure of\ngraphite.\n\nProblems 2-5\nOver the next few problems we will analyze the temperature profile in a nuclear fuel rod. The\nrod is very long and is 20 cm in diameter, and the air around it is held at 25°C by a water cooling\nsystem.\nProblem 2\nWrite down a \"word equation\" for conservation of heat in a small element of material of width\nΔr along the conduction direction. Include a term for heat generation. Then, introduce\nmathematical expressions for the terms in your word equation, assuming that q is the amount of\nheat generated due to radioactive decay, per unit volume. Letting Δr go to a differentially small\nsize, derive the one-dimensional heat conduction equation in the presence of heat generation.\nProblem 3\nSolve the equation you derived in Problem #2 for a fuel rod at steady state. Apply boundary\nconditions for heating in air at ambient temperature (T0) with a convective boundary condition\nand a known heat transfer coefficient of h. (Hint: there is a symmetry b.c. for the rod, which\nmay make the problem easier.)\nUranium undergoes a phase transition at 660C, and we want to avoid this because it would\njeopardize the mechanical integrity of the rod. What is the maximum rate of uniform heat\nproduction due to radioactivity that the rod can tolerate?\nProblem 4\nImagine that the heat transfer coefficient was reduced to 2 W/mK by placing the rods in a\nstagnant, inert atmosphere (to prevent oxidation). Now what can you say about the maximum\nallowable rate of heat production? Like many processing problems, there is an easier way that\nbrute-force. For the same problem, calculate the Biot number and prove that conductivity is fast\nin this situation. Then write down a simple expression that equates the heat generated in the rod\nto that lost by convection. Comment on the difference between your answer in question 3 and\nhere.\n\nProblem 5\nQuantitatively determine the dominant heat transfer process in the following situations:\ni. Cooling a 1m wide, 0.4m thick billet of steel in a 1m-thick refractory (Al2O3 / CaO blend)\nmold, which is in air and open on top.\nii. Blow-drying hair with a thin layer of water on the strand. Hair is ~80 microns in diameter,\nand the water layer is 40 microns thick.\niii. Quenching 3cm-thick slabs of Cu in water, which has a thin layer (10 microns) of oxide on\nits surface (like we saw in the video on the first day of class).\niv. Curing of a powder coating: 50 micron spheres of polyester resting on top of a 3mm-thick\naluminum substrate in a furnace.\nProblems 6-9\nIn this problem, you will learn an extremely powerful method for solving the heat equation, and\nde-mystify the \"series solutions\" in Poirier & Geiger. You will taken through the step-by-step\nprocess to solve the 1D heat equation with the boundary conditions Θ(0, τ) = 0 and Θ(1, τ) = 0;\ninitial condition Θ(ξ, 0) = 1 for 0 < ξ < 1.\nProblem 6\nAssume that the solution takes the form of a Fourier series:\nD\n8 0, r =\nr cos k 0 + Bk r sin (k 0\nAk\nk=o\nNote that Ak r , Bk r , and the form of k are unknown. Also, this solution is periodic in ξ,\nwhich is okay, all we are concerned with is the range [0, 1].\nae\nWrite down the 1D heat equation. Also write down\nae ,\n, and\na2e .\nar\na\n\nUsing your expressions for the derivatives of 8 0, r , substitute them into the heat equation.\nSolve for A(τ) and B(τ) (do not apply the boundary conditions yet). You should include\nintegration constants which we will call Ak,r=o and Bk,r=o.\nProblem 7\nApply the boundary condition 8 0, r = 0 to find a restriction on Ak r and/or Bk r . Then,\napply the second boundary condition to place a restriction on k. Write your solution with the\nconsequences of these two boundary conditions included.\nNext, we will make use of the initial condition to find the integration constants Ak,r=o and\nBk,r=o. The initial condition, combined with the boundary conditions, and the periodic form of\nthe solution, should suggest a very famous function that can be written in the same form as our\n\nexpression for 8 0, r .You can use your Fourier skills for 18.03 or 3.016 to find this expression,\nor you can look it up in a textbook or on the web (but only from trustworthy sources, which you\nshould cite). Now that you have found every unknown in the equation, write the solution,\n8 0, r .\nProblem 8\nNow that you have a complete solution to this problem, plot it. Instead of taking the series to\ninfinity, plot it for several values of kmax at τ = 0.001. Be sure to include the case of only 1 term.\nHow many terms does it take to converge?\nRepeat the above plot, but at a later time of τ = 0.1. Now how many terms are required for a\ngood approximation? Now you should appreciate under which conditions the infinite sum can be\nsimplified dramatically...\nProblem 9\nPlot the solution at τ = 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 0.5, and 1. Use as many terms as you judge are\nappropriate.\nMany solutions to the conduction equation can be used in more than one situation. First, give 2\nexamples of real-world, engineering situations that this solution would apply to, and relate the\nsymbols in the equation to real dimensions, temperatures, etc. Second, describe a different set of\nboundary and initial conditions in which this same equation can be used as the solution (hint:\nsymmetry).\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n3.044 Materials Processing\nSpring 2013\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

We have\nassumed that 100% of the energy released by the decay is heat, but even if this is way off, it will not\nchange our answer by 5 orders of magnitude. Of course, rods can overheat in real life and cause a melt\ndown, but that is because neutrons released in radioactive decay can catalyze other nuclei to decay\nand set off a chain reaction. We have completely neglected this chain reaction effect here, but it essen\ntial for nuclear power plants to work - without this effect, fission would not release nearly enough heat to\nbe a useful source of energy (as is shown by our analysis here).\nProblem 4\nRepeat the analysis using the Biot number\nI decided to change the statement of this problem after I initially wrote it, and thus it was necessary to\nuse h = 2 W em2K to ensure that we were in the Newtonian regime. But, it turns out that this was unness\nesay - we can see from our plots above that we are well within the Newtonian regime even in air. So,\nlowering h will not change out answer - it is Newtonian either way! Let's prove it:\nBi = h L / k = (10 W em2 K) (0.125 m) / (2 27.5 W/mK) = 0.023 with h = 10 W em2K\nand Bi = 0.0045 with h = 2 W em2K.\nIn either case, conduction is really fast and there are no temperature gradients. Thus, we can say at\nsteady state, the rate of heat accumulation is zero:\nrate of accumulation = A qin - A qout + V qgen = 0\nwhere A is the area through which heat is lost/gained, and V is the volume over which heat is generated.\nqin = 0, so\nA qout = V qgen\nh HTss - Tf) (2 p R z) = q (p R2 z)\n2 h HTss - Tf) = q R\n2 h HTss - TfL\nq =\nR\nThis equation relates the steady-state temperature with the rate of heat production in the rod. Much\neasier!\nIf Tss may not exceed 660 C and h = 2 W em2 K, then the maximum rate of heat production allowed is\n2.0 104 W em3. Using this model and h = 10 W em2 K to check our previous work, we find the maxi\nmum rate of heat production is 102 000 W em3, which is extremely close to the actual value of 99000\nW em .\nPrinted by Wolfram Mathematica Student Edition\n\nProblem 5: determine the dominant heat transfer process,\ni.e., the rate-limiting step\nCooling a 1m wide, 0.4m thick billet of steel in a 1m thick refractory mold, open\non top\nFirst, list all of the heat transfer processes happening:\n1. Conduction inside the steel\n2. Conduction to the mold on 4 equivalent sides (the 1m direction)\n3. Conduction t the mold through the bottom (the 0.4m direction)\n3. Convection on the top of the billet\nNote: The thermal conductivity of steel is ~37 W/mK. The thermal conductivity of a typical refractory\nblend is about 5-10ish W/mK near the 1000K, so let's pick 8 W/mK.\nNext, make relevant comparisons of the rates of heat transfer:\nCompare 1 & 2: The length to use for the steel is 0.5m because heat is escaping on both sides, i.e., it\nonly has to cross half of the billet to escape. The length to use for the mold is 1m because it is a one-\nsided heat transfer. The ratio of conductivities is Hk eLLmold eHk eLLsteel = 0.11. Thus, conduction in the steel\nis faster than through the mold, but not by a whole lot.\nCompare 1 & 3: This is just like before, except the length for the steel is 0.2m. The ratio of conductivities\nis Hk eLLmold eHk eLLsteel = 0.043. Thus, we know conduction in the steel is fast, and this is not limiting.\nCompare 3 & 4: Use the Biot number, h L/k = (10 W em2 K) (0.2 m) / (37 W/mK) = 0.054, thus conduc\ntion in the steel is fast and loss to the air is limiting.\nFinally, decide what matters, and doesn't matter:\nBecause the billet is thin in one dimension, and conduction along that dimension to the air and mold is\nfast compared to convection in air and conduction in the mold, we can neglect conduction within the\nbillet. If the ratio of conductivities was more extreme in the 1 & 2 comparison, we might have to worry\nabout conduction within the plane of the billet as well, but it is 0.11, which is only barely over our factor\nof-10 cut off. However, the ratios when comparing 1 & 2, 1 & 3, and 3 & 4 are very similar: 0.043/0.054\n= 0.80; 0.11/0.054 = 2.0; 0.11/0.043 = 2.6. They are all silimar. This means that the rate-limiting heat\ntransfer process is loss of heat from the billet to the surroundings: tranfer processes 2, 3, and 4 are all\nimportant, only process 1 can be neglected.\nBlow-drying wet hair\nFirst, list all of the heat transfer processes happening:\n1. Conduction inside the hair strand\n2. Conduction through the water layer\n3. Convection within the water layer\nPrinted by Wolfram Mathematica Student Edition\n\ny\n4. Convection of the aggitated air at the water surface\nNote: The thermal conductivity of water is ~0.6 W/mK (from NIST: http://www.nist.gov/data/PDF\nfiles/jpcrd493.pdf). The thermal conductivity of plastics and fibers is usually between ~0.2 - 1 W/mK, so\nlet's pick ~0.6 for hair. The air is highly aggitated, so h ~50 W em2 K.\nNext, make relevant comparisons of the rates of heat transfer:\nCompare 2 & 3: Is water better at conducting, or convecting? The water is probably nearly stagnant\n(though agitated vs. stagnant doesn't matter much), so let's pick h = 1400 W em2K. Convective conduc\ntivity = h. Conductive conductivity = k/L. Thus, the comparison is h L/k, like a Biot number, except the k\nvalue is also for the fluid. h L/k = 0.093, so we can probably neglect the convection and only worry\nabout water conduction. Note that convection is usually faster than conduction in water, but we are in\nthe unusual case of a very, very thin layer of water, so conduction actually wins out.\nCompare 1 & 2: The length to use for the hair is R/2 = 20mm. The length to use for the water is 40mm\nbecause it is a one-sided heat transfer (ignoring the cylindrical nature of the geometry). The ratio of\nconductivities is Hk eLLwater eHk eLLhair = 0.5. Thus, conduction is equally important in the hair and water. In\nfact, because their thermal conductivities are equal, they act like one uniform material with radius R =\n80mm. This approximation works because convection only contributes a little to the heat transfer.\nCompare 1/2 & 4: Use the Biot number to compare conduction through the strand/water layer and\nconvection in air. h L/k = (50 W em2 K) (40 mm) / (0.6 W/mK) = 0.0033, thus conduction in the solid/liq\nuid is fast and transfer from the air is limiting.\nFinally, decide what matters, and doesn't matter:\nThis case afforded us some nice simplifications, and one process clearly emerged as limiting. Heat\ntransfer via convection from the air to the surface of the wet hair strand is rate-limiting.\nQuenching oxidized copper in water\nFirst, list all of the heat transfer processes happening:\n1. Conduction inside the copper\n2. Conduction through the oxide layer\n3. Convection of the water\nNote: The thermal conductivity of copper is ~390 W/mK. The thermal conductivity of copper oxide isn't\nprovided in our tables, but all oxides are about 5-10ish W/mK, so let's pick 8 W/mK.\nNext, make relevant comparisons of the rates of heat transfer:\nCompare 1 & 2: This is a two-sided sheet, so LCu = 1.5cm and Loxide = 10 mm. Hk eLLCu eHk eLLoxide =\n0.033. Thus, we can neglect the oxide layer because it does not sustain temperature gradients.\nCompare 1 & 3: Compute the Biot number for stagnant water: h L/k = (10 W em2 K) (0.015 m) / (390\nW/mK) = 0.00038. Thus, conduction is waaay faster than convection.\nPrinted by Wolfram Mathematica Student Edition\n\nFinally, decide what matters, and doesn't matter:\nHeat transfer via convection of the water at the copper surface is rate-limiting.\nQuenching oxidized copper in water\nFirst, list all of the heat transfer processes happening:\n1. Conduction inside the polyester\n2. Convection of the air around the powder\n3. Conduction of heat through the aluminum into the polyester\nThe aluminum substrate can in theory contribute heat to the powder particles, but the contact area is\nvery small. If you chose to neglect transfer via aluminum, that is okay.\nNote: The thermal conductivity of aluminum is ~235 W/mK. The thermal conductivity of polyester (a\ntypical polyester is PET) is ~0.2 W/mK.\nNext, make relevant comparisons of the rates of heat transfer:\nCompare 1 & 2: Compute the Biot number: h L/k = (10 W em2 K) (16.7 mm) / (0.2 W/mK) = 0.00084.\nThus, conduction is much faster than convection.\nCompare 2 & 3: Compute the Biot number: h L/k = (10 W em2 K) (0.0015 m) / (235 W/mK) = 0.000064.\nThus, conduction is much faster than convection.\nCompare 1 & 3: Heat reaches the aluminum on both sides, so LAl = 1.5mm and Lpowder = R/3 = 16.7 mm.\nHk eLLAl eHk eLLpowder = 13. Thus, the aluminum heats up quickly compared to the powder, so it is possible\nthat the main source of heating is actually via the contact with the substrate (especially for real particles,\nwhich are not spherical).\nFinally, decide what matters, and doesn't matter:\nThe most likely way the particles heat up is by the air heating the aluminum, which heats the powder\nparticles from below. Thus, the limiting heat transfer process is convective transfer from the air to the\naluminum.\nPrinted by Wolfram Mathematica Student Edition\n\nCo.\n-de\n~ == i ~\ncoS(k~) + ~ S\\N(k~)\nd L\n.s§:: ~ -~A/t\")9N(l~) + K ~I<.(L) co~(kS)\nd~\nr..~O\n'\"\ni':f',. \":t - Ie'- A/c) '-\"\" /'3) -\n\\<.\"- ,,/1::) S'N (k~)\nd :::>\n1<:-0\n-\n_ k 1. 6(\\/C)\nS I) e:,<;1'11\" I.,)\"T (; e \\!\\lId\n1-\\ ~i:I\\e:- ~ Vi\"--naN:\nfo ~\n'd.>\\<.~ -r ~~ S'N k~ = ~o-k'1. /.\\/e) Co; \\:~ _k'2 5/r)'\" KJ\np.,u...\nCo':> k~ ~ SIN i:.s\np.e..E\n\\£ IU'I\\.\n\\N -n-£ SfR.-IG S\n/'f' 0Sf\nd~k-((:) :::c ~ k2.

Think\nabout ice cubes in your drink - the corners melt first, then the edges, and the cube\nbecomes rounded quickly.\nOn the last pset, we used an infinite series equation to describe the 1D conduction\nproblem with a fixed surface temperature. In this problem, we will revisit that\nequation, but use superposition to address the heating of an infinite square prism.\nMake a plot in the x-y plane within the relevant domain showing reduced\ntemperature contours for values e = 0.99, 0.9, 0.75, 0.5, 0.25, 0.1, 0.01. Do this for a\nfew dimensionless times to get a feel for the heat transfer situation. You should use\nthe full series solution.\nRepeat the above procedure, but this time for a cube with a fixed surface\ntemperature. Use superposition to make contour plots in the x-y plane of the same\ndimensionless times and reduced temperature contours in x and y as before, for z =\n0.25 and z = 0.5.\nComment on the difference between the 1D, 2D, and 3D solutions.\n\nProblem 2\nIn class, we will analyze the soak-heating of a billet of steel, prior to rolling. We\nplaced the billet in a furnace at 1000Q C to austenitize it, and we needed it to be at\nleast 900Q C throughout before we started rolling. The furnace air provided a high\nheat transfer coefficient of 3 100 Wjm2K.\nIn class, we treat two cases: a billet of 25 cm thickness, long in the two other\ndimensions, and a symmetric square bar, 25 x 25 cm in cross-section, long in the\nthird dimension. For this problem, you will analyze the case of a rectangular cross\nsection: 25 cm thick, with a width of 1 m. How long does it take to achieve 900Q C in\nthe center of this billet? (Hint: you will need to do some guessing-and-checking on\nthis one, iteratively using the graphical solutions from P&G).\n\nProblems 3 - 5\nSometimes in real engineering situations, you can't simplify the problem. In these\ncases, it is critical to be able to look up solutions and use them. In these three\nproblems, you will use the two recommended reference books:\nJ.

Quantitative simplification\nCalculation the Biot number for the z direction:\nBi = h L / 2 k = (10 W e m2K) (0.05m) / (35 W/mK) = 0.014\nThe Biot number is small -> we can neglect heat transfer via convection, all heat\ntransfer will occur in the interior of the steel slab.\nTherefore, look for a solution T(r, z). Change the difficult convective boundary\ncondition to zero flux at the z=0, r>a surface.\nNote: some folks might be confused why our solution will still depend on z, even\nthough the Biot number is small in z. This is because the Biot number compares\nconduction in z with convection at the surface. Convection is so slow that it won't\ncontribute at all to the transfer of heat. However, conduction in z occurs at the\nexact same speed as conduction in r because the slab is isotropic. So, if our\nsolution depends on r, it better depend on z too, because conduction is equally\nfast in r and z. All that we can conclude from a small Biot number here is that we\n8 pset2solns.nb\n-laser spot has radius a\n-symmetry at r = 0: ¶∂T/¶∂r = 0.\nPrinted by Wolfram Mathematica Student Edition\n\npset2solns.nb 9\ncan neglect heat loss to the air, all heat will be dissipated internally.\niii. Find the steady-state solution, plot it, and identify melt (if any)\nWhat is the solution going to look like? Many people expect that you should treat\nthe laser as a point source and treat the body as finite in z. But, the thing that\nsets the relevant length scale in any heat transfer problem is not the dimensions\nof the objects involved, but the dimensions of the heat transfer process. The\nheat is coming in over a little disk of radius 0.1mm and spreading radially out-\nward in r and z. It doesn't care about the surface at z = 10cm because the length\nscale of the actual heat transfer is orders of magnitude smaller. As far as the\nheat is concerned, that surface is too far away to matter, so you can treat it a\nsemi-infinite in z.\nThis relevant solution can be found in Carslaw & Jaeger, the chapter on the flow\nof heat in regions bounded by surfaces of the cylindrical coordinate system,\nsection 8.2: the steady temperature in an infinite or semi-infinite medium due to\nheat supply over a circular area, page 216, equation 14, \"the region z > 0 with\nconstant flux Q over the circular area r < a and zero flux over r > a\":\nT = Q a\n¶e-l z J0 l\nJ1\nk\nr\nwhere T = temperature, Q = heat\ntivity, l =\nY\ndummy variable,\nH\nL\nHl a\nl „l\nflux over the circle 0 < r < a, k = thermal conduc-\nz =\nL e\ncoordinate into the slab, r = radial coordinate, J0,\nJ1= zeroth and first kind Bessel J functions.

For example, consider a spherical\ndroplet of metal (radius R) that is sprayed into a vacuum chamber, to solidify into a\nparticle of powder. (This process is called atomization). For this situation, identify the\nrate-limiting step, and write out a global heat balance equation at the surface of the\ndroplet. Assume that there is no superheating in the liquid, and state any other\nassumptions required. You should pay special attention to two things here: (i)\nsolidification occurs in vacuum, and (ii) the geometry is spherical.\nProblem 2\nIn Problem 1, you derived a differential equation. Solve it, and derive an equation for the\nsolidification time for the droplet in vacuum (an analog of Chvornikov's rule).\nProblem 3\nIn class, we have thought about casting in molds for three cases: (i) interface resistance-\nlimited, (ii) conduction through the solid-limited, and (iii) conduction through the mold-\nlimited. Different scaling laws govern the solidification time for the three cases. If you\nthink about it, any of these three things could dominate at different times for a thick\ncasting. Interface resistance might dominate early in a cold mold, for example. As the\nsolid thickens, the conduction of heat through the solid becomes more significant by\ncomparison. Determine the time for which each heat transfer step dominates the kinetics\n(if ever); assume you are casting iron into an initially cold mold with an interface\nresistance of 4000 W/m K.\n\nProblem 4\nLook up the phase diagrams for the following four alloys: Mg-Al, Mg-Y, Mg-Li, Mg-Zn.\nFor each system, calculate the partition coefficient for solidification of Mg-rich alloys.\nIdentify the systems for which there is not a single partition coefficient, and explain why.\nProblem 5\nFor an Mg - 2 at% Al alloy with extremely rapid diffusion in the liquid phase, describe\nhow solidification will occur, and draw some schematics that indicate the composition\nprofile that evolves upon solidification with a plane front. Calculate the volume fraction\nof the solid that will solidify with a eutectic microstructure, and the fraction that will be\nsingle phase.\nProblem 6\nIn class, we discussed the process of zone refining, where a molten zone of width L is\npassed along the length of a rod of a material gradually, pushing dissolved impurities to\nthe end of the rod. Diffusion is rapid in the liquid, and does not happen in the solid.\nConsider the solute balance in the molten zone of width L: write down a balance equation\nmatching solute entering with that leaving.\nProblem 7\nIdentify the boundary condition that we should apply to the equation you wrote down in\nProblem 6 at x = 0. Solve the differential equation, which gives the solute distribution\nprofile in the rod after a pass of zone refining. Plot the distribution.\nProblem 8\nFor the magnesium-rich alloys from Problem 4, you want to do some zone refining to\nremove the other elements. Based on your understanding from Problems 6 and 7, which\nelements will be more easily removed than the others, and why?\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n3.044 Materials Processing\nSpring 2013\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

      "content": "Problem 1\nIn this problem, there are 3 heat transfer processes: heat generation at the solid/liquid interface, conduc-\ntion through the droplet, and radiation into the chamber.\n1. Compare conduction in the droplet to radiation into the chamber:\nM = e s T3 L/k\nFor a metal, e = ~0.1; T ~ Tm = 1000 C, k >= 10ish W em2K. There are no gradients in the solid for M\n<= 0.1, so the largest droplet with no gradients is:\nlMax = 0.1 μ 10 I0.1 μ 5.67 μ 10-8 12733M\n11.6968\nAtomization will not involve 11 meter-radius blobs of molten metal, so there will not be gradients in\nreasonable, small droplets. Therefore, we can neglect conduction in our heat balance.\nThe rate-limiting step is heat removal via radiation at the droplet surface.\nNext, write the heat balance between the heat generated and the radiation:\nQrad = Qgen\nArad qrad = Agen qgen\nArad = surface area of the droplet, 4 p R2.\nAgen = area of the s/l interface, 4 p s2.\nq\nrad = e s IT - Twalls M\nqgen = r Hf ds/dt\ntherefore, R2 e s IT4 - T\nwalls ) = s2 r Hf ds/dt\nProblem 2\nStart with the last equation above.

The goal of this question was for you to demonstrate that\nyou have thought about when heat transfer steps during solidification are negligable and why.\nThree heat transfer processes:\n(i) interface resistance. thermal resistivity = 1/h. This is invarient with time.\n(ii) conduction through the solid. thermal resistivity = Ls ks. This will change with time!\n(iii) conduction through the mold. thermal resistivity = Lm km. This is invarient with time.\nProcesses (i) and (iii) are time-independant. Therefore, only\ne\none or the other will matter, you will not\nhave both be important at different times in same problem.\ne\nSimply compute the Biot number to see what\nhappens: if Bi small, interface resistance is limiting. If Bi is big, conduction through the mold is limiting. If\n0.1 < Bi < 10, then both matter, and that is annoying.\nLet's look at when Bi is small and interface resistance dominates. A typical refractory material has k ~ 5\nW/mK, and we need hsm Lm km § 0.1, so Lm must be less than 0.1 5 W mK\n4000 W m2 K = 125\nmm. Conversely, Lm ¥ 1.25\ne\ncm for conduction in the mold to dominate. Given that molds usually must be\nstrong to support their molten contents, they will probably be cm-scale or thicker. Thus, if a refractory\nmold is not actively cooled, it is almost certainly the case that interf\nH\nace re\ne\nsist\nL\na\ne\nn\nI\nce is negligable!\ne\nM\nThis\nshould be comforting, given that we made this assumption in class without justification.\nProcess (ii) will not matter at t = 0 because Ls = 0, but Ls scales with\nt , so eventually it will matter.\nThere will be a switch between conduct\ne\nion-l\ne\nimi\nH\nte\ne\nd by\nL\nthe mo\nH\nld\ne\nto limited by the solid when the ratio if\nresitsances is between 0.1 and 10: (Ls\ns\nm\nm\ns\nm\nm\ns o\ns\nW/mK)) = 2.9 Ls. So, conduction in the mold is rate-limiting when Ls < 0.29m, conduction in the solid is\nrate-limiting when Ls > 29m, and both contribute for castings in between. Since I can't think of some-\nthing larger than 29m that we'd cast in a 5cm-thick mold, we can conclude that we never really get to\nthe case of conduction through the solid-limited solidification. Therefore, conduction through the solid\ncan only be limiting when the mold is actively cooled and the interface resistance is sufficiently small to\nnot be the limiting step. How small must it be? Bi = hsm Lseks ¥ 10 for interface resistance to be negliga-\nble. If we have a 1m-thick casting, hsm must be greater than or equal to 350 W em2 K. This is quite likely\nbecause solid-solid interfaces tend to be ~thousands of W em2 K, it is reasonable to think that solidifca-\ntion through the solid can be limiting in a cooled mold.\nIn short, in a mold that is not actively-cooled, for castings less than 0.1 Lm ksekm thick, conduction in the\nmold is limiting (s μ∝\nt ). For thicker castings, both conduction in the solid and in the mold matter (s μ∝\nnet effect of the two conductivities, probably goes as\nt ).\nIn an actively-cooled mold, interface resistance is limiting (s μ∝ t) until the casting is 10 ks/HLs hsm) thick,\nat which point conduction through the solid becomes limiting (s μ∝\nt ).\nk )\nL\nk\n= L k\nL\nk ) L (5 W/mK) / ((~5 cm) (35\nPrinted by Wolfram Mathematica Student Edition\n\nProblem 4\nA great resource for phase diagrams is the ASM database\n(http://www1.asminternational.org/asmenterprise/APD/default.aspx)\nThe partition coefficient will be constant if the liquidus and solidus are stright lines. If they curve, then cs\nand/or cl will vary with temperature, so k will vary.\nMeasured at eutectic temperature (for simplicity) off the phase diagrams:\nMg-Al cs = 11.1 at% cl = 30.7 at% k = csecl = 0.362 single value?

Consider the sheet to be moving at a velocity v0, and write down an\nequation for the flow of the molten zinc as a function of distance from the sheet.\nProblem 2\nFor the same process of hot-dip galvanizing, imagine that as the sheet leaves the bath, it\nis coated with 50 microns of molten zinc at the melting temperature of zinc. The sheet\nremains at room temperature, and is 2 mm thick. Derive an equation that would describe\nthe solidification of the zinc coating, and determine the time required to do so. Look up\nany values you need, and provide a numerical answer.\nProblem 3\nIn class we discussed the flow of a liquid past a solid spherical\nparticle. For laminar flow, the flow field in this situation is\nshown at the right, straight from the class notes.\nExplain briefly how the flow field in this picture can be\ndetermined mathematically. First, explain the coordinate\nsystem that would be most appropriate for this problem. Then,\nwrite down the equation to be solved, and the boundary\nconditions necessary. DO NOT try to solve the problem; just\nlay it out through the above series of steps.\n\nProblem 4\nFollowing on from Problem 3, what if we were dealing not with a solid sphere, but with a\nvapor bubble of the same size, fixed in the same location. Indicate what elements of the\nsolution method would change as compared with Problem 3.\nIn a plane that cuts through the equator of the sphere, draw a schematic of what you think\nthe flow field would look like around the bubble. As an example, this is done for you\nhere for the solid sphere case. Complete the drawing for the case of the bubble at the\nright. Write one sentence of explanation for your drawing.\nProblem 5\nShear mixers essentially work by having a long, thin, solid inner cylinder concentric with\na larger outer shell cylinder, with a gap in between. The inner cylinder spins relative to\nthe outer cylinder. Solve for the fluid flow profile inside the shear mixer by writing down\nthe appropriate form of the Navier-Stokes equation and the appropriate boundary\nconditions.\nNow find the analogous heat transfer problem solution and translate each variable into\nthe language of fluid flow. Also write down the heat transfer problem boundary\nconditions and translate those to fluid flow.\nProblem 6\n(a) Find the terminal velocity of a settling spherical particle, including buoyancy. Assume\nthat the fluid is stationary, and that flow will be laminar.\n(b) Is it possible that the flow around the particle could become turbulent due to it sinking\nthrough otherwise stationary fluid? What properties of the particle promote turbulence?\n\nProblem 7\nRed blood cells (RBCs) are separated from blood plasma by centrifuging. The average\nhuman RBC is about 7 microns in diameter and has a density of 1125 kg/m3. Assuming\nthat the RBC is a sphere and the individual RBCs do not interact, estimate how fast a\ncentrifuge with radius 5cm must spin so that the RBCs can be separated in 1 minute.\nAssume that the test tubes are oriented at 45 degrees, and that they are 10 cm tall. Also,\ntake the density of plasma to be 1025 kg/m3 and the viscosity of blood plasma to be 0.004\nPa s. Is your answer reasonable?

Let's revisit this\nproblem for a non-Newtonian fluid with a flow rate exponent of 'm'.\nFirst, write down the steady-state flow equation and note how it is different when\n'm' is added. Write down the boundary conditions, too. Integrate the equation once\nto obtain an expression for dv/dx.\n\nProblem 2\nBefore integrating a second time, apply one of the boundary conditions to simplify\nthe equation. Then, integrate again. Apply the second boundary condition and give\nthe complete solution.\n\nProblem 3\nMake some plots of your solution to Problem 2, showing how the flow profile\nchanges from Newtonian flow into the non-Newtonian regime. Include the\nNewtonian solution we found during the first fluid flow lecture.\n\nProblems 4 & 5:\nYou are designing a factory to blow mold Al bottles.

Your customers want grooves on the bottles, which introduce\nperturbations as the bottle is blown out. Some preliminary testing reveals that the\nperturbation size relative to the original thickness obeys the following function:\n(perturbed region thickness/original thickness) = Exp[-290 m-1 (groove depth)].\nProblem 4\nCompare the fracture strain for each alloy to an estimate of the total strain you\nexpect a smooth-walled bottle to experience during blow-molding.\nProblem 5\nDetermine the maximum grove depth tolerable for each alloy.

For this problem, let's say that no local melting or phase\ntransformations occur.\n\nPart A:\n\nLet's take the system to be a simple 2-\nD situation as shown, where the laser\nbeam is very wide (infinite into the\npage) compared to its thickness. Let's\nalso assume that the beam has been\ntravelling for a long time, so we are in\na steady state condition (with a moving\ncoordinate system; direction of travel is\nshown). Write down the form of the\nconduction equation that you would use to solve for the heat distribution in this problem.\n\nPart B:\n\nWrite down the set of boundary conditions that are appropriate for the upper surface of the sheet.\n\nPart C:\n\nWrite down any other boundary conditions that you think you would need to solve this problem.\nLaser beam\nsubstrate\n\nProblem #2: Swimming for Their Lives (the particles, not the students)\n\nIn continuous casting, one of the major problems is that\nsmall inclusion particles can be caught in the casting.\nLet's analyze this problem, for small inclusions of Al2O3\n(which are actually quite common in steel).\n\nPart A:\n\nThe key consideration is that the alumina particles float in\nmolten steel. For such a particle in the melt region at point\n'A', the particle is (a) trying to float to the top, (b) but\nbeing propelled downward at the casting velocity vc (= 1 m/min) at the same time. Write down a\nreasonable and simple condition that decides whether the particle will eventually escape at the\ntop surface, or be carried down and get incorporated in the metal in the sump.\n\nPart B:\n\nLet's calculate the velocity at which the particle would rise. Write down the force balance for\nparticle 'A', and indicate with what velocity it rises. (For this part of the problem, ignore the vc\neffect.)\n\nPart C:\n\nSome particles will escape, and some will not--calculate which size particles will escape and\nwhich will not. You may need the information at the back of the test, and the viscosity of the\nmelt is 7·10-3 Pa·s.\nsolid metal\nmelt\nParticle 'A'\nvc\n\nProblem #3: Due Dilligence is Conducted on the Professor\n\nIn class, a long time ago, we looked at the problem of glass\nfiber drawing. We explicitly looked at the required cooling rate\nto keep a new fiber of diameter 20 μm, drawn from the fluid,\nfrom breaking up into droplets before it became rigid. A\nschematic of the process in shown at the right.\n\nNow, back when we looked at this problem, we knew heat\ntransfer but not fluid flow. Accordingly, you had to trust me\nthat the kinetics of the fluid flow problem were known.\nSpecifically, I told you that the time to break up the cylindrical\nfiber into droplets was on the order of milliseconds.\n\nNow that you know a bit about fluid flow, please revisit this assertion. Can you convince\nyourself (and me) that the millisecond timescale is reasonable?\n\nInformation: the material is glass at 900° C, μ = 102 Pa·s, ρ = 2500 kg/m3, γ = 0.5 J/m2.\n\nPart A:\n\nStart by writing down the Newtonian flow equation, and rearranging it so that you have units of\nseconds on either side.\n\nPart B:\n\nReplace stress in your equation with a characteristic stress that is driving the break-up of the\nfiber into droplets.\n\nPart C:\n\nEvaluate the characteristic time for droplet breakup. Is it of millisecond scale?\n20 μm\n\nProblem #4: Collapsing Under the Pressure (not the students, the voids)\n\nIn the final stage of sintering, isolated voids shrink to remove surface area. As we discussed in\nclass, these voids will contain trapped gas if the sintering was conducted in air, and applied\npressure can help to overcome the pressure contained in the voids. Let's look at how such voids\nshrink.\n\nPart A:\n\nWrite down the pressure balance equation that would apply if we are pressing powders in the\nfinal stage of sintering under the conditions described above.\n\nPart B:\n\nIf the pores first form at a size roughly that of the initial powder size, with radius rp, and they\ninitially trap gas at atmospheric pressure, then write down an equation that shows how the\npressure in the pores increases as they shrink.\n\nPart C:\n\nCombine Parts A and B to provide an expression for the equilibrium pore size in the final stage\nof sintering.\n\nProblem #5: The Fun of Multidimensional Diffusion Encounters the World of Chemical\nVapor Deposition\n\nIn CVD, a chemical reaction in the vapor provides a source for deposition, and diffusion is\nresponsible for bringing the reacted gases to the substrate surfaces. In class we discussed some\npossible geometries for this process. Let's try another one--imagine a long square tube, where\nwe want to coat the sides of the tube. The reactive gasses are flowed in along the tube length, at\na high rate so that flow is essentially uniform (plug flow) in the tube.\n\nPart A:\n\nWrite down the form of the diffusion equation that you would use to analyze this process.\nExplain any simplifications that you would employ, and the set of boundary conditions you\nwould use as well.\n\nPart B:\n\nCan this problem be addressed by a superposition approach? In other words, are there two or\nmore 1-D diffusion solutions that we can put together to give the full solution? If the answer is\nyes, please write down an approximate solution to the problem, or indicate what the solution\nwould consist of. If the answer is no, please explain why it cannot be done.\n\nGas flow\n\nProblem #6: A Spoonful of Slurry Will Cure What Ails You\n\nThink about an unusual slurry, in which two different powder materials (call them A and B) are\nsuspended. Each of the two powders has its own isoelectric point, and therefore its own zeta\npotential. The graph below shows how pH affects their zeta potentials.\n\nNow, a series of experiments is\nconducted. First, a small amount\nof slurry is mixed up, with some\nconcentration of A and B particles.\nThe pH is adjusted to a specific\nvalue, and the particles are allowed\nto settle. The experiment is\nrepeated five times, for the\nconditions listed below. For each\nexperiment, draw a picture of what\nthe settled particle packing might\nlook like. In each case, write ONE\nSENTENCE explaining your\nthoughts and why they led to the\npicture you drew.\n\n(1) 100% A, 0% B, pH = 5\n(2) 0% A, 100% B, pH = 5\n(3) 50% A, 50% B, pH = 3\n(4) 50% A, 50% B, pH = 7\n(5) 50% A, 50% B, pH = 9\n\npH\nZeta\npotential 0\n-100 mV\n+100 mV\nA\nB\n2 4 6 8 10 12\n\nProblem #7: Get Wired\n\nThe process of wire coating is commonly used to put\nthe plastic (insulating) sheath around electrical wires of\nall kinds. It looks like an extrusion process, in the\nsense that polymer is forced through a die. However,\nin wire coating the polymer flow is induced by the\nmotion of the wire, which is pulled at a fixed rate, vo.\n\nPart A:\n\nWrite down the proper form of the fluid flow equation for this problem, and explain any\nsimplifications that you feel can be made in this regard.\n\nPart B:\n\nList the boundary conditions for flow through the die channel region. You may need to define\nsome geometrical parameters--please be sure the meaning of any symbols you introduce is clear.\n\nPart C:\n\nWrite down the solution to the equation from part A, subject to the boundary conditions from\npart B. (You can solve it if you want to, or perhaps there is some other way to get the answer...)\n\nvo\ndie channel\n\nProblem #8: The Students Face Down a Real Phase Diagram\n\nYou are given a rod\nof titanium that\ncontains 1 at% cobalt,\nand asked to purify it.\nLooking at the Ti-Co\nphase diagram, you\nreason that this alloy\ncould be zone refined,\nexactly as discussed\nin your 3.044 class.\nYou place the rod into\nan induction coil and\npull it through slowly,\nlocally melting and\nresolidifying the rod\nas the hot zone passes\nover it.\n\nAt the end of one\npass, you analyze the leading end of the rod--this is the first part of the rod to be melted and\nresolidified.\n\nPart A:\n\nFrom the phase diagram, you estimate that the alloy composition at the end of the bar should be\nabout 0.6 at% after one pass through the zone refiner. Explain this estimate.\n\nPart B:\n\nYou are shocked to find, however, that the end of the bar is quite substantially purer than you\nfirst suspected it might be! The composition is ~0.1 at% Co. Explain why the rod is so pure at\nthis end, and why specifically it is at a value near 0.1 at% Co. (Note: your measurements are\nmade after the rod is cooled back down to room temperature).\n\nProblem #9: Outside-In Heat Transfer\n\nWe have frequently talked about processes in which a solid was heated or cooled by virtue of its\ncontact with a fluid (or vapor) that exchanged heat at the interface by convection. What if the\nproblem went the other way around? How long does it take to heat a vapor with a hot solid? We\nhave never thought through this problem, but I think you should be able to do it on the fly.\n\nConsider a furnace where the heating elements are in the walls; the walls may be considered as\ninstantaneously being raised to a temperature Tw at t = 0. Derive an equation that tells how the\ntemperature rises in the furnace as a function of time. You may assume that the air flow in the\nair is rapid, so that the whole furnace interior is at a constant temperature.\n\nYou may need to introduce some\nquantities/variables (such as the volume of air in\nthe furnace, V, among other things). Please\nexplain when you do and label the symbols so I\nknow what you are thinking.\n\nWalls at Tw\n\nAir inside\nfurnace\n\nProblem #10: Blowing Hot and Cold\n\nBelow are five scenarios in shape forming. In each case, there is a question about how a change\nin temperature can impact the process. For each, indicate whether an increase or a decrease is\nthe required change, and explain in ONE SENTENCE why this is the case.\n\nA) A sheet being stretch-formed is developing a local thin region that leads to a rupture.\nThe engineer in charge would like to introduce a local air jet that would either heat or\ncool the material near the thinning region.\n\nB) Aluminum is being shape formed at a stress of 1\nMN/m2 and 300° C; the ductility is insufficient to\nform the desired part geometry. A deformation\nmechanism map is provided for this material.\n\nC) A thermoplastic is being continuously film-blown into a large tube. The plastic is\ncoming out cloudy.\n\nD) Glass is being poured continuously onto a bed of molten tin. The waves created on\npouring are not damping fast enough, and the sheet is coming out non-planar.\n\nE) A melt is being sprayed into an atomization chamber to create powders. These are\ncoming out irregularly shaped instead of spherical.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n3.044 Materials Processing\nSpring 2013\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

Let's\nanalyze this problem, for small inclusions of Al2O3 (which\nare actually quite common in steel).\nParticle 'A'\nThe key consideration is that the alumina particles float in\nsolid metal\nmolten steel. For such a particle in the melt region at point\n'A', the particle is (a) trying to float to the top due to the\nbuoyancy force (F = Δρ·g·V, with V the particle volume),\n(b) but being propelled downward at the casting velocity vc\n(= 1 m/min) at the same time.\nPart A:\nWrite down a reasonable and simple condition that decides whether the particle will eventually\nescape at the top surface, or be carried down and get incorporated in the metal in the sump.\nPart B:\nLet's calculate the velocity at which the particle would rise. Write down the force balance for\nparticle 'A', and indicate with what velocity it rises. (For this part of the problem, ignore the vc\neffect.)\nmelt\nvc\nPart C:\nSome particles will escape, and some will not--calculate which size particles will escape and\nwhich will not. You may need the information at the back of the test, and the viscosity of the\nmelt is 7·10-3 Pa·s.\n\nProblem #2: A Question you are in a Super Position to Answer\nIt is sometimes possible to use the principle of superposition for fluid flow problems. (Of course\nthis is no surprise, seeing the pervasive analogies between flow and diffusion.)\nBelow are some common situations in fluid flow. Explain whether or not you can use\nsuperposition to solve for the flow field in each case. If superposition is possible, explain what\ngeometries/solutions are superposed. If it is not possible, explain why not.\nPart A) Fluid is pumped down a pipe of square cross-section.\nPart B) Gravity drives flow down a rectangular channel open to the air on top.\nPart C) A cylinder of aspect ratio 1 is filled with water, closed, and spun on its axis, leading to\nrotational flow of the liquid inside.\n\nProblem #3: The Students Face Down a Real Phase Diagram\nYou are given a rod\nof titanium that\ncontains 1 at% cobalt,\nand asked to purify it.\nLooking at the Ti-Co\nphase diagram, you\nreason that this alloy\ncould be zone refined,\nexactly as discussed\nin your 3.044 class.\nYou place the rod into\nan induction coil and\npull it through slowly,\nlocally melting and\nresolidifying the rod\nas the hot zone passes\nover it.\nAt the end of one\npass, you analyze the leading end of the rod--this is the first part of the rod to be melted and\nresolidified.\nPart A:\nFrom the phase diagram, you estimate that the alloy composition at the end of the bar should be\nabout 0.6 at% after one pass through the zone refiner. Explain this estimate.\nPart B:\nYou are shocked to find, however, that the end of the bar is quite substantially purer than you\nfirst suspected it might be! The composition is ~0.1 at% Co. Explain why the rod is so pure at\nthis end, and why specifically it is at a value near 0.1 at% Co. (Note: your measurements are\nmade after the rod is cooled back down to room temperature).\n\nProblem #4: Which Driving Force is Doing the Driving?\nIn class, a long time ago, we looked at the problem of glass fiber\nproduction. We explicitly looked at the required cooling rate to\nMolten glass\nkeep a new fiber of diameter 20 μm, drawn from the fluid, from\n20 m\n1 m\nbreaking up into droplets before it became rigid. A schematic of\nthe process in shown at the right.\n1 cm\nNow, back when we looked at this problem, we knew heat\ntransfer but not fluid flow. Let's talk about fluid flow this time\naround.\nInformation: the material is glass at 900° C, μ = 102 Pa·s, ρ =\n2500 kg/m3, γ = 0.5 J/m2.\nPart A) There are two driving forces for flow of the molten glass through the aperture. Name\nthem, and determine which is dominant.\nPart B) There is one driving force for the breakup of the stream into droplets: capillary stress, σ\n= 2γ/r. Compare it to the driving forces from Part A and convince yourself (and me) that it is\nsignificant in this process. Pay attention to units here.\n\nProblem #5: Stretchy or not so Stretchy?\nPolyethylene is a very nice\nmaterial to form into shapes with\nviscous forming operations. At\nthe right are data for the rheology\nof polyethylene. NOTE: These\ndata are plotted on\nLOGARITHMIC SCALES. The\nslope tells you about the strain\nrate sensitivity.\nPart A) For a fixed forming rate\n(a shear rate of, say, 10 s-1), higher\ntemperatures lead to more stable\nflow. Provide an estimate of the\ntensile ductility at 300o C vs. 120o\nC.\nPart B) As a process designer, you would like to operate at the lowest possible temperature and\nthe highest possible rate. Explain briefly how, with the help of this data, you would identify an\noptimum processing condition? What data would you need to do such an analysis?\n\nProblem #6: Amazing Brazing\nCopper\nBraze alloy\nCopper\nA\nB\nThe process of brazing is essentially like casting: a melt is placed between two objects to be\njoined; the melt then solidifies, holding the objects together. These pictures show cross-sections\nof braze joints between two copper pieces (which are on the top and bottom).\nHere are three variables in this process: (i) braze alloy composition, (ii) thickness of the braze\nregion, (iii) temperature of the copper sheets.\nPart A) If (i) and (ii) are exactly the same between the two cases A and B, explain how (iii) must\nbe different between them. Provide one sentence of physical explanation.\nPart B) If (ii) and (iii) are exactly the same between the two cases A and B, explain how (i) must\nbe different between them.

If you do more than 5 problems, I will grade the first\n5 that are not crossed out.\n5) Make sure that you READ THE QUESTIONS CAREFULLY\n6) Reasonable assumptions are permitted, but please state them clearly.\n7) Supplementary materials are attached to the end of the test (eqns., etc.)\n8) WRITE YOUR NAME HERE:\n\nProblem #1: In Which A Curious Shape is Heated\nA complex shape of steel is shown below; it is long into the page (this is a cross-section).\nsteel\n25 cm\nIn the heat treatment of this shape, we need the whole piece to achieve a temperature between\n600o and 625o C for 2 hours.\nPart A:\nOur engineers claim that we have a unique process that can instantaneously fix the surface\ntemperature at a desired value. What value should we choose? Write 1 sentence explaining your\nchoice.\nPart B:\nObviously, this shape is complicated, but we still need to know how long it takes to heat the\nwhole thing up once we apply our process from Part A. In 4 sentences or less, explain how you\nwould make a good estimate of the heating time for this specific part.\nPart C:\nWell, it turns out that our engineers were wrong- although our process heats the surface fast, it is\nnot instantaneous. It actually has a convective surface coefficient that is high--about 105 W/m2s.\nExplain briefly how this changes your answers from Parts A and B.\n\nProblem #2: Newtonian or Non-Newtonian\nWe always enjoy a problem when conduction is fast relative to the competing processes, don't\nwe? For each of the following situations, figure out whether or not the cooling will be\nNewtonian.\nA) A slab of copper, 20 cm thick, is cooled differently on its two sides: one side has fans\nblasting air at it, and the other is in water.\nB) A 2 mm thick plate of alumina ceramic is cooling in still air at a temperature of 1500o C.\nC) A thin film of aluminum just 10 m thick is sitting in still argon gas on a silicon\nsubstrate; the whole stack is cooled from 600o C.\n\nProblem #3: Serial or Parallel Casting\nWe are going to do some sand casting, of metal objects that are all the same size. We will do it\ntwo different ways, named process I and II. Here are schematics of the molds:\nsand\nsand\nI\n\nII\n\nPart A:\nDraw a schematic of how the solidification process occurs in process I, by charting the location\nof the solidification front vs. time. Make sure you show the point where the solidification is\ncomplete. Explain the shape of the curve in one sentence.\nPart B:\nDraw a similar chart for the center of the three objects in process II. Explain how it is different\nfrom your answer in part A, or if it is the same; why it is the same.\n\nProblem #4: See Spot Weld. Weld, Spot, Weld.\nSpot welding involves a pair of electrodes, which are used to\napply a high current through two laid-up sheets, as shown\nhere. Take the sheets to be 0.5 mm thick each.\nHeat is generated evenly within the two sheets as a\nconsequence of the current passing through them (resistive\ncurrent\nmetal\nelectrodes\nheating).
