  "course_description": "This comprehensive course on the visual system is designed to ground future researchers in the field of visual science and to provide scientists with an excellent basis for using the visual system as a model in research. In this graduate seminar, anatomical, neurophysiological, imaging and behavioral research is examined in an attempt to gain a better understanding of how information is processed in the primate visual system.",

  "syllabus_content": "Course Meeting Times\n\nLectures: 1 session / week, 3 hours / session\n\nOverview\n\nIn this seminar anatomical, neurophysiological, imaging and behavioral research will be examined in an attempt to gain a better understanding of how information is processed in the primate visual system. The first five sessions provide an overview of the functional and structural organization of the visual system with a critical examination of some of the basic issues in the field. Thereafter the emphasis will shift to the question of how various aspects of the visual scene are processed in the visual system. We will study color vision, adaptation, the role of eye movements in carrying out visual analysis, motion perception, depth perception and pattern perception. The last session will examine the issue of visual prosthesis. The reading assignments for the most part will draw on original research articles. As the course proceeds, there will be increasing time devoted to class discussion. Each person taking the course for credit is expected to give three reports on assigned articles lasting 15-20 minutes each. The reports should include a discussion of the directly relevant background and issues. There will be a final written examination during the MIT exam period. Readings will be put on reserve in the Science Library. Lecture outlines and presentation materials will also be available. In order to make the class discussions informative and dynamic, participants are asked to read the Preparatory Assignment listed for the reading material for each session, all of which can be found on my website,\nThe Schiller Lab at MIT\n.\n\nReadings\n\nThe reading assignments for the most part will draw on original research articles. As the course proceeds, there will be increasing time devoted to class discussion.\n\nAssignments\n\nStudents give three oral presentations on a selected research article.",
