  "course_description": "This course provides students with an opportunity to conceive, design and implement a product, using rapid prototyping methods and computer-aid tools. The first of two phases challenges each student team to meet a set of design requirements and constraints for a structural component. A course of iteration, fabrication, and validation completes this manual design cycle. During the second phase, each team conducts design optimization using structural analysis software, with their phase one prototype as a baseline.\nAcknowledgements\nThis course is made possible thanks to a grant by the alumni sponsored Teaching and Education Enhancement Program (Class of ‘51 Fund for Excellence in Education, Class of ‘55 Fund for Excellence in Teaching, Class of ‘72 Fund for Educational Innovation). The instructors gratefully acknowledge the financial support. The course was approved by the Undergraduate Committee of the MIT Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics in 2003. The instructors thank Prof. Manuel Martinez-Sanchez and the committee members for their support and suggestions.",

  "syllabus_content": "Course Meeting Times\n\nLectures: 2 sessions / week for 4 weeks, 4 hours / session\n\nDescription\n\nThis course develops a holistic view of and initial competency in engineering design by conceiving, designing, manufacturing and testing a system component such as a complex structural part. Activities include hand sketching, CAD modeling, CAE analysis, CAM programming and operation of CNC machining equipment. Requirements compliance is verified in the laboratory via structural testing. Initial designs are improved by means of multiobjective design optimization. The focus is on the design process itself as well as the complementary roles of human creativity and computational methods and tools. Designs are executed by pairs of students who enter their products in a design competition. The pedagogy is based on active learning and a balance of lectures and hands-on activities. Enrollment may be limited.\n\nPrerequisites\n\n16.010, 16.020 or\n2.001\n,\n2.002\nor permission of instructor\n\nRationale for Offering this Subject\n\nA recent survey of undergraduate students in the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics (in conjunction with the new Department Head Search in 2003) has shown that there is a desire for training in modern design methods using state-of-the-art CAD/CAE/CAM technology and design optimization. Individual students have suggested the addition of a short and intense course in rapid prototyping, combined with design optimization. The intent of this course is to respond to this perceived gap, while exploiting synergies with other engineering departments that have articulated similar needs.",

      "content": "16.810\n\nIAP 2007\nEngineering Design and Rapid Prototyping\n\nJanuary 14, 2007\nVersion 1.3\n\nDeliverable A\n\nRequirements and Interface Document (Example)\n\nSystem: __MIT Formula SAE Racecar 2005____________\n\nComponent or Subsystem: __Rear Spoiler______________\n\nTeam Name: _______\"Need for Speed\"________________\n\nTeam Member 1: _____Mario Andretti _________________\n\nTeam Member 2: _____ Jeff Gordon ___________________\n\n1. Component Description\n\nA new rear wing design is needed for the 2005/2006 model year MIT Formula SAE race\ncar. The rear-mounted wing (Fig.1) is intended to maximize downward force (negative lift),\nwhile at the same time minimizing incremental drag and weight added to the vehicle. The wings\nhave to conform to regulations (constraints) and be designed and manufactured in an economical\nfashion.\n\nAerodynamic efficiency is one of the\nmost important elements in developing a\ncompetitive race car. Aerodynamic design is\nconcerned with two primary elements: reducing\ndrag (D) and increasing downforce (negative\nlift, L). Downforce is necessary in maintaining\nhigh speeds through the corners and forces the\ncar to the track. In actual race car design there\nare\ncomplex\ninteractions\nbetween\nthe\naerodynamics of the front wing, rear wing and\nthe chassis as all three main components (in\naddition to the tires) contribute to both drag and\ndownforce.\nz\nx\nFigure 1: Race car rear wing\n\n2. Functional Requirements\n\n2.1 The rear wing shall produce a downforce of at least 250 N (Newtons of force) at the\nsteady state operating condition in the -z direction.\n\n2.2 The rear wing shall not produce more than 75 N (Newtons of force) of drag at the steady\nstate operating condition in the x direction.\n\n2.3 The mass of the rear wing shall not exceed 2.5 kg.\n\n2.4 The structural integrity of the rear wing shall be maintained over the entire operating\nregime of the vehicle, including all speeds and cornering conditions below 100 miles per\nhour (mph). A safety factor of 2 shall be used for all structural load cases.\n\n2.5 The wing shall not deflect by more than 10 mm at any point below 100 mph.\n\n3. Constraints\n\n3.1 The steady state operating condition is defined as a straight line un-accelerated drive at\n60 miles per hour (60 mph) over flat terrain\n\n3.2 The rear wing may only be manufactured from 6061 aluminum, blue construction\ninsulation foam (R-8 insulation value), fiberglass and epoxy adhesive. Manufacturing\nshall occur on an OMAX waterjet machine, assuming a rate of $75/hour.\n\n3.3 The wing shall be created as an extrusion of a 2D wing section, thus limiting the\naerodynamic analysis to 2D section airfoils. There will be no taper or dihedral allowed.\n\n3.4 No external energy source is allowed as part of the device.\n\n4. Interface Definition\n\n4.1 The maximum design envelope for the wing and its support structure is 20\" x 20\" x 40\"\n(width, height, span).\n\n4.2 The support structure must match the dimensions and the hole pattern shown in Fig. 2.\nThere are two support brackets located 39.75 (+/-0.5) inches apart, from inside surface to\ninside surface. The two bolts holes (5/16th inch O.D.) on each side the supporting fixture\nare 16.0 inches apart, and 1.0 inch above the lower plane of the envelope.\n\nFigure 2: Wing support structure and attachment points\n\n5. Verification\n\n5.1 The rear wing will be mounted on the attachment structure (Fig.2) and a set of\nmeasurements will be taken in the MIT Wright Brothers wind tunnel with a six axis load\ncell. From these measurements the lift, drag and side force will be extracted and\ncompared with requirements (2.1, 2.2 and 2.3), respectively.\n\n5.2 The wind tunnel will be run between 10 to 100 mph in 20 mph increments. The safety of\nthe wing will be verified throughout the operation by monitoring the test with video\ncameras from the control room (2.4)\n\n5.3 A static load test will be performed. The maximum deflection limit (2.5), and safety\nfactor for stress will be verified with laser distance measurement equipment and bonded\nstrain gauges.\n\nSignatures\n____Mario Andretti___________________\n\n_____Jeff Gordon____________________"

Component Description\n\nA rectenna is an antenna attached to a rectifying circuit. In order to power the climber, the\nrectenna system needs to be able to convert microwaves into DC. The current will then\ncharge up a capacitor array on the climber and power the two onboard motors. Without the\nrectenna array the climber will not be capable of converting the beamed power into useable\ncurrent. The higher the efficiency of the rectenna array the better. The design of the current\nsystem (for each unit) is composed of a tuned patch antenna, diodes and a capacitor.\n\n2. Functional Requirements\n1. Produce the necessary DC voltage output. The motors run at 24v, so in order to avoid use\nof inefficient DC step-up circuits, the entire array must provide at least 24v.\n2. Provide the required current. Since the gearbox has not yet been built and the final\nclimber weight has yet to be determined by the corresponding groups, it is impossible to\ndetermine the exact requirement here. Preliminary bench tests demonstrate a requirement\nof approximately 400W from 75m away. The governing requirement here is that the\ndevice have enough power to scale the 100m ribbon in 50 seconds.\n3. Properly shield the upper portion of the climber from the microwave source\n\n3. Constraints\nThe system shall be constrained by the following equation:\nMass_climber * height * gravity >= integral of\n[Beam_density(h) *\nefficiency_of_rectenna(Beam_density, T) *\nEfficiency_of_energy_storage -\nwork_being_done_by_climber(v)/efficiency_of_rest_of_system] dt\nThis and other considerations produce the following set of constraints:\n\n1. For maximum efficiency, total effective surface area of the rectenna array cannot go over\nthe size of the beam plus swing tolerance of approximately 1m.\n2. Rectenna cannot deliver too much power over a given period of time (due to capacitor\nrestraints). This is fixed by merely running tests later on and increasing the speed of the\nclimber as well as putting current-dissipating circuitry, if necessary.\n3. Beam is 800W/SA for the current moment, which might change depending on the power\ndelivery team's success. It is our group's hope that this number increases. We have made\nthe following requests to the power transmission team: to increase output to 10kW and to\nensure that the beam width is 308cm wide (to utilize the entire diameter of the current\ndish).\n4. According to competition guidelines, not more than 25% of the total power needed on the\nsystem can be stored at any given time. This means the device needs to still deliver\ncurrent from 75 meters away. Assuming a 25 kg climber moving at 2 m/s up a 100m\nribbon, one quarter of this energy is 6,250J. Due to inherent inefficiencies and the\nsubsequent need for more energy than the calculated 25,000J, the actual max power the\nsystem can store is slightly greater.\n5. Rectenna needs to be able to receive power at distance of at least 75 meters (in order to\nnot break 25% rule discussed above).\n6. Materials are limited. Antennas will probably be made on PCB traces. If so, conventional\nPCB conductors include copper, tin-lead solder, immersion silver, and electroless nickel.\n7. Temperature considerations. The array will be operating in a room-temperature plus or\nminus approximately 20 degrees environment. In addition, higher current delivery (such\nas when the device is closest to the transmitter) will mean the array will heat up from the\nhigh current delivery. Such temperature fluctuations have a direct effect on efficiency.\n\n4. Interface Definition\n\n1. Can provide power to a capacitor, ensuring no overload\n2. Output is monitored by software\n3. Shield must be structurally sound for items above it (the payload system)\n\n5. Verification\n\nA small sample board will be constructed and then placed in the beam with power traces\nrunning off of it. This will give an efficiency rating for the surface area. To test diffusion a\nsystem will have to be designed where the effective diffusion is the same (perhaps use a\nblock of material that diffuses it well). It is assumed that the system will run into adverse\nsituations such as swinging from wind, which not only causes non-perpendicularity with the\nfield (causing lowered power absorption), but swing will also cause part of the antenna array\nto not be in contact with the directional field. Since there will be onboard capacitors to\ndeliver current in sub-optimal conditions, testing of our system will be done under an optimal\nconfiguration. That is, the array will be perpendicular to the field, and the array will cover the\nentire field. Under these conditions, we need to be able to deliver approximately 400 watts,\nor\n\nSignatures\n_________________________\n\n_________________________\n\n_________________________"

Component Description\n\nThe NASA Centennial Challenges were created to help\nstimulate interest in the concept of a Space Elevator. The\nPower Beaming competition at these challenges required\nteams to design a robotic climber capable of ascending 100\nmeters of ribbon in 50 seconds. The rules dictate that\npower for the climber can only come through an external\nbeam, and the use of sunlight is strictly prohibited. MIT's\nSpace Elevator Team (MITSET) has chosen microwave\nradiations as the source of power for their climber. It is\nNAOT's goal to design the source of this microwave beam\nfor MITSET's robotic climber. The ability of the climber\nto meet the required 2m/s average speed relies on the\nability of the power source to provide a continuous beam\nof microwave radiation to the climber's rectenna array.\nThis must be accomplished despite the rapid oscillations\nthe climber is expected to experience and over varying\ndistances. The rectennas also require a beam of circularly\npolarized microwave radiation, which must be created and\ndirected toward them even though most common\nmicrowave\ngenerators\n(magnetrons)\ncreate\nlinearly\npolarized non-collima\nRibbon\nRibbon Mast\nCommand\nand Control\nClimber\nRectenna\nBeam\nBeam Source\n(NAOT's design)\nted radiation.\n\n2. Functional Requirements\n\nOur team's subsystem will necessarily be complex, so to set ourselves an achievable goal, we\nhave separated requirements into first-level and second-level requirements, the latter being those\nthat MITSET would benefit from, but aren't crucial to the system's performance.\n\n2.1 First-Level Requirements\n\n2.1.1 The system must transfer at least 400W of true power over a period of 50 seconds to a\n1.8m diameter horizontal rectenna oscillating with an amplitude of 1m situated at a\nvarying altitude of 10 to 60m.\n2.1.2 If any components are added to the climber, their total weight cannot exceed 8.5kg\n2.1.3 If any components are added to the climber, they must comply with all climber\nrequirements as detailed in section 2.2.1 of the NASA Space Elevator Centennial\nChallenge rulebook[1].\n\n2.2 Second-Level Requirements\n\n2.2.1 The beam source must be able to be turned on.\n2.2.2 The beam source must be able to switch off in 5 seconds of a stop command.\n\n3. Constraints\n\n3.1 The transferred power must be microwave radiation circularly polarized at 5.81GHz\n3.2 The system must comply with any applicable regulations as well as, so far as possible, the\nlaws of physics.\n\n4. Interface Definition\n\nJust as with the requirements, this section has been divided into primary and secondary interface\ndefinitions. Secondary interface definitions are not crucial to the system's integrability with the\nrest of MITSET's hardware, but would benefit them if included.\n\n4.1 Primary Interface Definitions\n\n4.1.1 The power source must have its own generator or comply with a 100kVA apparent\npower, 120V (single phase), 208V or 480V (three phase) generator using a bare wire\nconnector.\n4.1.2 The beam source must fit around a ribbon anchor connected to the ribbon, modeled as an\nimmobile .5m-side cube sitting on the ground, or must provide power away from it.\n\n4.1.3 The beam must be safe for spectators situated at a distance of 50m from the climber\nribbon anchor as well as for any operators situated closer than 50m from the ribbon\nanchor, or be operable from a 50m distance.\n4.1.4 The beam source must be storable in a cubic box of 1.5m side.\n4.1.5 The beam source must be assembled and connected from its stored state within 20\nminutes with a team of 2 or 15 minutes with a team of 3.\n\n4.2 Secondary Interface Definitions\n\n4.2.1 The beam must have a master off switch.\n4.2.2 The beam control box must have two 5V command output lines: \"start\" and \"enable\".\n4.2.3 The beam control connector should be a standard mini connector, McMaster 69355K74\nor compatible. This connector will be on our control box. The beam source can use on-\nline connector such as McMaster 69355K71 or compatible, with enough cable to reach\nour control box.\n4.2.4 The beam source must be able to stand on a semi-paved or compacted ground surface and\nmust be able to level.\n4.2.5 If the beam is not visible, the beam source must have a visible \"beam is on\" indicator\nlight on it, and a 5V output line indicating the state of the beam. If there are multiple\nphysical beam sources, the \"beam on\" line should be high if any of them is on, the \"beam\non\" indicator light should be on each source, and the \"master off\" switch should kill all\nsources. The time delay between the command and the change in beam state must not\nexceed 1 second.\n4.2.6 The beamed electromagnetic radiation must preserve the integrity of a 110m long 100mm\nwide vertical ribbon made of Siegler-USA GG-25A-20 material under a tension of\n6500N.\n4.2.7 The beamed electromagnetic radiation must preserve the integrity of a 110m long belay\nline of yet undefined characteristics situated 30 to 50 cm away from the ribbon.\n\n5. Verification\n\nThe team will be required to prove that they fulfill any secondary interface definitions, or\nsecond-level requirements. The following tests will be performed to verify that the system\nsatisfies the rest of this document:\n\n2.1.1 The design will be tested using sensitive measuring equipment to test the power output\nfrom a rectenna placed in the microwave beam produced by the system. It will be\nmeasured at varying distances up to 60m. This will take place on the track possibly with\nsome shielding for the microwaves placed behind the test.\n2.1.2 Will be tested by weighing the finished system on an accurate scale.\n2.1.3 Will be met by making sure everything meets the specifications set forth in the NASA\nSpace Elevator Centennial Challenge rulebook.\n3.1 The Microwave radiation transmitted will be applied to a rectenna to measure the output\nvoltage.\n3.2 MIT's safety office will be asked to verify that the system abides by all known applicable\nregulations.\n\n4.1.1 Power input into the system will be carefully measured during the extent of the field test.\n4.1.2 Will be tested by building a .5m box and placing the beam source on/around it.\n4.1.3 Shielding may be used to ensure safety of spectators and the MIT safety office will help\nto ensure that the system is safe.\n4.1.4 The beam source will be disassembled and placed in a 1.5m box to demonstrate that it is\nstorable.\n4.1.5 Two or three team members, as appropriate, will be timed as they assemble the beam\nsource.\n\nSignatures\n_________________________\n\nChris Mandy\n\n_________________________\nArka Dhar\n\n_________________________\n\nEthan Huwe\n[1] http://www.elevator2010.org/site/documents/climber_rulebook_2007.1.00.pdf"

Component Description\nDesigned and constructed during six weeks of the VDS summit in Summer 2006, the Assisted\nHuman Powered Vehicle (AHPV) is a concept of a human-solar car hybrid. Due to the tight and\nrigid deadlines involved, the AHPV was left unfinished, with no means of egress/ingress, and\nproblems with visibility due to the lack of a proper windshield.\nOur task is to design and implement a method for the driver to enter and exit the vehicle, and to\ncreate a windshield that affords the driver more visibility. These systems can be treated either as\ntwo separate systems or one integrated system. As well as the important practical aspects of the\ndesign, we must also pay special attention to the aesthetics of the vehicle; in four weeks, it will\nbe presented by the CEO of Solidworks at a major conference. Further in the future, the AHPV\nwill compete in the Shell Eco Marathon in California.\n2. Functional Requirements\n2.1. The ingress/egress system must allow a middle-aged person, well built, 170 cm to enter\nor leave the vehicle unaided, in no more than 30 seconds.\n2.2. The visibility in the seated driving position must be at least 150o in the horizontal\ndirection, with maximum visibility in the vertical direction (below horizontal line of\nsight.)\n2.3. Windshield should resist a force of 550N/m2 without deformation. (Based on drag force\nat 100km/h.)\n2.4. Weight of the windshield system should be minimized, with a weight per unit area less\nthan twice that of the shell (i.e. less than 5kg/m2).\n\n2.5. Completed shell must be aesthetically pleasing (unquantifiable criteria).\n3. Constraints\n3.1. The ingress/egress and windshield systems must mount to the AHPV steel frame or\ncomposite shell. If mounted to the composite shell, the shell must be sufficiently\nreinforced in the mounting zone to prevent deformation of shell shape at vehicle\noperating speeds (up to 100km/h).\n3.2. The ingress/egress system cannot be able to come into contact with the rear solar panel\narray in any configuration.\n3.3. If vehicle controls are to be moved to accommodate ingress/egress system, they must\nstay within arms length (0.75 meters) of any drivers in the specified size range.\n3.4. Total cost of the project should not exceed $1800, including materials, outside\ncontracting, etc.\n3.5. Deadline for completion, including testing is Jan 30th 2007.\n4. Interface Definition\n4.1. The external dimensions of the ingress/egress and windshield systems will maintain the\nshape of the existing shell.\n4.2. The ingress/egress and windshield systems will be integrated within the existing steel\nstructure.\nIngress/Egress\nWindshield\n5. Verification\nThe geometry of the system will be modeled using CAD software (e.g. Solidworks). CAE (e.g.\nCosmosworks) will be used to verify load distribution, deformations under loading, etc.\nRapid prototypes will then be created, for better visualization of digital mockups, and human\ntests will be carried out after fabrication."

Component Description\n\nThe subsystem of the MIT Space Elevator\nTeam's climber to be modified is the roller\nassembly (a CAD diagram of which appears\non the right), the purpose of which is to\nmove the climber assembly up the ribbon. It\nattaches to the rest of the climber via four\npolycarbonate support tubes. The purpose\nof the modifications is to reduce the weight\nof the roller assembly so as to increase our\nscore and to decrease the amount of power\nthat needs to be supplied in order for the\nclimber to climb the ribbon. The primary\ngoal of these changes is to minimize the\nweight and cost of the final roller assembly\nwhile maintaining structural integrity and\nfunction.\n\nFigure 1: Full Roller Assembly\n2. Functional Requirements\n\n2.1 The weight of the climber should be minimized from the current 15kg. The lower weight\nmaximizes the score during the competition and aids the power team by lower the power\nrequirement.\n2.2 The cost of the climber should be minimized. This allows the money to be used in other\nareas of the team.\n2.3 The climber must be able to be attached to the ribbon in less than four minutes in order to\nallow enough time for all other parts of the competition assembly to occur.\n2.4 A factor of safety of 2 should be maintained. This allows a guide in the type of materials\nto be used and that noting too fragile is used.\n\n3. Constraints\n\n3.1 The climber must survive a 2meter drop test with no structural integrity failures.\n3.2 The climber must lift its own weight.\n3.3 The average speed of the climber must be maintained at 2 m/s.\n3.4 The material must not be damaged by 5.8 GHz microwave radiation.\n3.5 In case of rain, the climber must be water resistant.\n3.6 The climber must be able to resist 11.5mph winds.\n\n4.

Verification\n\n5.1 For the testing of the clamping of the climber, the climber must be mounted by the team.\nThe mounting will be timed as the team puts the climber on. In order to replicate the\nactual conditions of the competition, the ribbon will be shaken as this is done.\n5.2 Structural integrity will be verified by \"yank test.\" The climber will be pulled down from\nribbon from a height of 2 meters onto a soft landing surface. The climber will be tested\nfor retaining structural integrity.\n5.3 CAD verification regarding the weight of the climber will be tested with a scale.\n5.4 The climber will run up the ribbon to make sure that it can lift its weight and reach 2 m/s.\n5.5 The climber will be subjected to 5.8 GHz radiation to make sure that the components that\ncan handle the radiation.\n5.6 The climber will be hosed with water to simulate rain.

Component Description\n\nVDS 2.0 needs a new hub motor designed. It's currently using a commercial motor from\nNGM that produces about 7 kW of power. They need one that meets similar high-efficiency\nstandards but that produces a higher power. Building a hub motor that fits into the existing\ncontrol and power infrastructure will make things easier for everyone, so we need to build a\nmotor that still takes 3-phase DC power.\n\nThe hub motor should be powerful enough (i.e. provide enough torque) to drive the car\non a road. It should be durable for long-term use and should contain any internal failures\n(electromagnetic or physical) in a way that is safe for the passenger and bystanders. It should\nalso be reasonably cheap to manufacture, and it should be simple enough that we can construct it\nand test it (either ourselves or by getting external resources for manufacturing) by the end of the\nclass. We need to essentially be able to simply replace the 7kW motor with this one without\nchanging the design of the rest of the vehicle's subsystems (with the exception of the controller,\nwhich might need reprogramming based on layout differences).\n\n2. Functional Requirements\n1. The motor will deliver ten kilowatts of continuous power.\n2. The motor will be more than ninety percent efficient at forty-five miles per hour.\n3. The motor will sustain a driving speed greater than fifty miles per hour.\n4. The motor will provide enough torque to accelerate a combined vehicle and load\nmass of one thousand pounds from zero to sixty miles per hour in at most fifteen\nseconds.\n5. The motor will weigh less than thirty kilograms.\n\n3. Constraints\n1. The motor and enclosure must fit in between the wheel and the suspension arm and\nnot interfere with the hole in the outer shell of the vehicle. The motor and its\nenclosure may not restrict the operation of the suspension arm.\n2. The motor must not draw more power than the controller can supply.\n3. The motor must not generate more torque than the suspension arm bolt hole can\nsupport.\n\n4. Interface Definition\n\n1. The hub motor must interface in a mechanically secure fashion with the wheel (Fig.\n1) on one side, with a central axle hole and six evenly spaced holes arranged radially\naround it. Through the wheel it must interface with the suspension arm bolt hole and\nfive radially spaced holes (Fig. 2). On the other side it must interface with the chain\nhub (Fig. 3) for the pedal drive via a 3.5\" threaded column.\n2. The hub motor must be controlled by the NGM EV-C200 motor controller (Fig. 4).\n3. The hub motor must be powered by the solar/battery system.\n\nFig. 1: Wheel\n\nFig. 2: Suspension Arm\n\nFig. 3: Chain Hub\n\nFig. 4: Controller & Power Interface\n. Verification\nwill be weighed.\n\nest and and loaded and will have its power input and\n3.\ne vehicle will be driven and the top\n\n1. The motor\n2. The motor will be set up in a t\nst\noutput measured (and its efficiency calculated).\nThe motor will be installed in the vehicle itself, th\nspeed and average acceleration will be measured (by speedometer and by stopwatch\nrespectively).\n\nSignatures\n___Eric Conner_____\n\n___Matt Peddie_____\n\n___Harvey Tang____"
