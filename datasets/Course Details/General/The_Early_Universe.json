ISBN: 9780465024377.\n\nRecommended Books\n\nLiddle, Andrew.\nAn Introduction to Modern Cosmology\n. 2nd ed. Wiley, 2003. ISBN: 9780470848357. [Preview with\nGoogle Books\n]\n\nGuth, Alan H.\nThe Inflationary Universe\n. Basic Books, 1998. ISBN: 9780201328400.\n\nOther Readings\n\nThere is no textbook that I know of that is really appropriate for the intended content of this course, although Barbara Ryden's book,\nIntroduction to Cosmology\n, comes much closer than any book I have seen previously. Steven Weinberg's\nThe First Three Minutes\nis a superbly written book which gives an excellent description of cosmology in general, and the synthesis of the light chemical elements in particular. But it does not describe the mathematical details. It has a mathematical appendix, but the description there is very sketchy.\n\nWeinberg's book has been required reading for this course since the first time it was taught, in 1986. Before 2000 I used Joseph Silk's\nThe Big Bang\nas a second required book in this course, and in 2000 and 2002 we used Rowan-Robinson's\nCosmology\ninstead. We used Barbara Ryden's book for the first time in 2004, and I have been using it since.\n\nFor the first part of the course (classical cosmology), the lectures and the associated lecture notes* will describe the subject at a level of detail that is much more mathematical than Weinberg's book, and a little beyond the level of Ryden's book. For the second part of the course (modern particle physics and its recent impact on cosmology), we will rely mostly on the lecture notes, although Ryden does have a good chapter on inflation. You will also be asked to read several articles from\nScientific American\nor similar publications.\n\n(* Prof. Guth's lecture notes are not available to OCW users, but his\nlecture slides\nare. Please see extensive review notes in the\nexams\nsection.)\n\nGrading\n\n75% of the course grade will be based on quizzes, which will be given in class during the normal lecture period. There will be three of these quizzes, and there will be no final exam. The remaining 25% of the grade will be based on problem sets. Problem sets will normally be assigned every week, but there will be some breaks due to holidays and in-class quizzes. There will be 10 problem sets altogether.\n\nACTIVITIES\n\nPERCENTAGES\n\nThree Quizzes\n\nProblem Sets\n\nSpecial Relativity\n\nIn the \"old\" days I began this course with a unit on special relativity, which consisted of two sets of lecture notes and about four lectures. However, with the advent of Relativity (8.033) this seemed a bit redundant, so in 1996 I dropped relativity from the syllabus. Special relativity is not, however, a prerequisite for this course. There will be a few more results from special relativity that will be needed as the course progresses (E = mc\n, for example), and I will try to point them out and summarize them carefully as we go along.\n\nCourse Outline\n\nDoppler Effect (and a little Special Relativity)\n\nKinematics of Newtonian Cosmology\n\nDynamics of Newtonian Cosmology\n\nIntroduction to Non-Euclidean Spaces\n\nBlack-Body Radiation and the Early History of the Universe\n\nThe Accelerating Universe and the Cosmological Constant\n\nBig-Bang Nucleosynthesis\n\nProblems of the Conventional (Non-Inflationary) Hot Big Bang Model\n\nGrand Unified Theories and the Magnetic Monopole Problem\n\nThe Inflationary Universe Model\n\nPrimordial Density Fluctuations and the Cosmic Microwave Background\n\nEternal Inflation and the Multiverse\n\nHomework Policy\n\nIn this course I regard the problem sets primarily as an educational experience, rather than a mechanism of evaluation. I have allocated 25% of the grade to problem sets in order to encourage you to do them, and to make life easier for students who find it difficult to do well on quizzes. You should feel free to work on these problems in groups, and I would strongly encourage you to do so. With the right mix of students, the homework can be more fun and more illuminating. I will in fact soon be setting up a Class Contact webpage to help you make contact with each other.\n\nHowever, it is important pedagogically that each student write up the solution independently. The simple copying of a friend's paper is not the kind of effort that the grading is intended to encourage. Using 8.286 solutions that have been circulated in previous years is strictly off limits. Using other sources, such as other textbooks or web documents, is considered perfectly okay, as long as you write up the solution in your own words.\n\nA homework problem which appears to be copied from another student, from a solution circulated in a previous term, or copied more or less verbatim from some other source (without rewriting in your own words) will be given a reduced grade, possibly a zero. Except in blatant cases, however, students will be given a warning the first time this happens, and will be given an opportunity to redo the relevant solutions. Since the homework is intended primarily for learning, and not evaluation, there is nothing that you can do on the homework--in this course--that will lead to an interview with the Committee on Discipline. I say this because I want to strongly encourage you to work in groups on the homework, and I don't want you to feel that there are any hidden dangers. (Remember, however, that you should not assume that this policy holds in other classes; different professors have different points of view on these issues.)",

We will keep track of\nthe extra credit grades separately, and at the end of the course I will first assign\nprovisional grades based solely on the regular coursework. I will consult with\nTingtao Zhou, and we will try to make sure that these grades are reasonable.\nThen I will add in the extra credit, allowing the grades to change upwards ac\ncordingly. Finally, Tingtao and I will look at each student's grades individually,\nand we might decide to give a higher grade to some students who are slightly\nbelow a borderline. Students whose grades have improved significantly during\nthe term, students whose average has been pushed down by single low grade,\nand students who have been affected by adverse personal or medical problems\nwill be the ones most likely to be boosted.\nThe bottom line is that the extra credit problems are OPTIONAL. You\nshould feel free to skip them, and you will still get an excellent grade in the\ncourse if you do well on the regular problems. However, if you have some time\nand enjoy an extra challenge, then I hope that you will find the extra credit\nproblems interesting and worthwhile.\nPROBLEM 1:\nNONRELATIVISTIC DOPPLER SHIFT, SOURCE\nAND OBSERVER IN MOTION (15 points)\nConsider the Doppler shift of sound waves, for a case in which both the source\nand the observer are moving. Suppose the source is moving with a speed vs relative\nto the air, while the observer is receding from the source, moving in the opposite\ndirection with speed vo relative to the air. Calculate the Doppler shift z. (Recall\nthat z is defined by 1+z ≡ λo/λs, where λo and λs are the wavelengths as measured\nby the observer and by the source, respectively.) Hint: while this problem can be\nsolved directly, you can save time by finding a way to determine the answer by using\nthe cases that are already calculated in Lecture Notes 1.\n\n8.286 PROBLEM SET 1, FALL 2013\np. 2\nPROBLEM 2: THE TRANSVERSE DOPPLER SHIFT (25 points)\nConsider the Doppler shift observed by a stationary observer, from a source\nthat travels in a circular orbit of radius R about the observer. Let the speed of the\nsource be v.\n(a) (5 points) If the wave in question is sound, and both the source speed v and\nthe wave speed u are very small compared to the speed of light c, what is the\nDoppler shift z? Assume that the observer is at rest relative to the air.\n(b) (5 points) If the wave is light, traveling with speed c, and v is not small com\npared to c, what is the Doppler shift z? This is called the transverse Doppler\nshift, since the velocity of the light ray is perpendicular to the velocity of the\nsource at the time of emission, as seen in the reference frame of the observer.\n(c) (5 points) Still considering light waves and the same pattern\nof motion as shown in the figure, suppose that the source\nand the observer were reversed. That is, suppose a light\nray is sent from the person at the center of the circle to the\nperson traveling around the circle at speed v. In this case,\nwhat would be the Doppler shift z?\n(d) (5 points) Now suppose that the motion is linear in\nstead of circular. Again we consider light rays, and as\nin part (b) we assume that the source is moving with\na speed v that is not small compared to c. If the light\nray is emitted by the source at the moment of its clos\nest approach to the observer, as shown in the diagram,\nwhat is the Doppler shift z?\n(e) (5 points) Again consider linear motion, with light\nrays. As in part (c), assume that the observer is mov\ning with a speed v that is not small compared to c. If\nthe light ray is received by the observer at the moment\nof its closest approach to the source, as shown in the\ndiagram, what is the Doppler shift z?\n\n8.286 PROBLEM SET 1, FALL 2013\np. 3\nPROBLEM 3: A HIGH-SPEED MERRY-GO-ROUND\n(This problem is not required, but can be done for 15 points extra credit.)\nNow consider the Doppler shift as it would be observed in a high-speed \"merry\ngo-round.\" Four evenly-spaced cars travel around a central hub at speed v, all at a\ndistance R from a central hub. Each car is sending waves to all three of the other\ncars.\n(a) If the wave in question is sound, and both the source speed v and the wave\nspeed u are very small compared to the speed of light c, with what Doppler\nshift z does a given car receive the sound from (i) the car in front of it; (ii) the\ncar behind it; and (iii) the car opposite it?\n(b) In the relativistic situation, where the wave is light and the speed v may be\ncomparable to c, what is the answer to the same three parts (i)-(iii) above?\nTotal points for Problem Set 1: 40, plus 15 points of extra credit.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n8.286 The Early Universe\nFall 2013\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

The first quiz will be\non Thursday, October 3, which I think makes it preferable to have Problem Set 3\ndue on Monday, September 30. That way Problem Set 3 can include all the material\ndiscussed through the lecture of Thursday, September 26, which is Lecture 7, and\nthen the quiz will include this same block of material.

Problem\nSets 1 through 3, including the reading assignments, will be included in the\nmaterial covered on Quiz 1, on Thursday, October 3.\nINTRODUCTION TO THE PROBLEM SET\nIn this problem set we will consider a universe in which the scale factor is given\nby\na(t) = bt2/3 ,\nwhere b is an arbitrary constant of proportionality which should not appear in\nthe answers to any of the questions below. (We will see in Lecture Notes 3 that\n\n8.286 PROBLEM SET 2, FALL 2013\np. 2\nthis is the behavior of a flat universe with a mass density that is dominated by\nnonrelativistic matter.) We will suppose that a distant galaxy is observed with a\nredshift z. As a concrete example we will consider the most distant known object\nwith a well-determined redshift, the galaxy UDFy-38135539, which has a redshift\nz = 8.55. The discovery of this galaxy was announced in September 2009 by\nthree groups of astronomers*, all of whom discovered it in infrared images in the\nHubble Space Telescope Ultra Deep Field. The redshift was initially estimated\n\"photometrically,\" which means that broad features of the spectrum are determined\nby measuring the light that comes through a range of filters. The redshift was\nconfirmed spectrographically in October 2010 by Lehnert et al.+\nThe rate at which the highest measured\nredshift has been growing has been dramatic.\nIn 1986 the highest measured redshift was only\n3.78. It was 4.01 in 1988, 4.73 in 1992, 4.897\nin 1994, and 4.92 in 1998, 5.34 in 2000, 6.28\nin 2002, and 6.58 in 2003. In 2006 Iye et al.++\ndiscovered a galaxy with a redshift of 6.96. In\n2006 Richard McMahon compiled the graph on\nthe right, which was published in a News arti\ncle on p. 128 of the same issue of Nature as the\nIye et al. discovery. The search for high red-\nshift objects continues to be an exciting area\nof research, as astronomers try to sort out the\nconditions in the universe when the first galax\nies began to form.\nPROBLEM 1: DISTANCE TO THE GALAXY (10 points)\nLet t0 denote the present time, and let te denote the time at which the light that\nwe are currently receiving was emitted by the galaxy. In terms of these quantities,\nfind the present value of the physical distance Rp between this distant galaxy and\nus.\n* R.J. Bouwens et al., Astrophys. J.

Find the ratio te/t0 for the z = 8.55\ngalaxy.\nPROBLEM 3: DISTANCE IN TERMS OF REDSHIFT z (10 points)\nExpress the present value of the physical distance in terms of the present value\nof the Hubble expansion rate H0 and the redshift z. Taking H0 ≈ 67 km-sec-1\nMpc-1, how far away is the galaxy? Express your answer both in light-years and\nin Mpc.\nPROBLEM 4: SPEED OF RECESSION (10 points)\nFind the present rate at which the physical distance Rp between the distant\ngalaxy and us is changing. Express your answer in terms of the redshift z and the\nspeed of light c, and evaluate it numerically for the case z = 8.55. Express your\nanswer as a fraction of the speed of light. [If you get it right, this \"fraction\" is greater\nthan one! Our expanding universe violates special relativity, but is consistent with\ngeneral relativity.]\nPROBLEM 5: APPARENT ANGULAR SIZES (20 points)\nNow suppose for simplicity that the galaxy is spherical, and that its physical\ndiameter was w at the time it emitted the light. (The actual galaxy is seen as an\nunresolved point source, so we don't know it's actual size and shape.) Find the\napparent angular size θ (measured from one edge to the other) of the galaxy as it\nwould be observed from Earth today. Express your answer in terms of w, z, H0,\nand c. You may assume that θ « 1. Compare your answer to the apparent angular\n\n8.286 PROBLEM SET 2, FALL 2013\np. 4\nsize of a circle of diameter w in a static Euclidean space, at a distance equal to the\npresent value of the physical distance to the galaxy, as found in Problem 1. [Hint:\ndraw diagrams which trace the light rays in the comoving coordinate system. If\nyou have it right, you will find that θ has a minimum value for z = 1.25, and that θ\nincreases for larger z. This phenomenon makes sense if you think about the distance\nto the galaxy at the time of emission. If the galaxy is very far away today, then\nthe light that we now see must have left the object very early, when it was rather\nclose to us!]\nPROBLEM 6: RECEIVED RADIATION FLUX (20 points)\nAt the time of emission, the galaxy had a power output P (measured, say, in\nergs/sec) which was radiated uniformly in all directions. This power was emitted\nin the form of photons. What is the radiation energy flux J from this galaxy at the\nearth today? Energy flux (which might be measured in ergs-cm-2-sec-1) is defined\nas the energy per unit area per unit time striking a surface that is orthogonal to the\ndirection of energy flow. The easiest way to solve this problem is to consider the\ntrajectories of the photons, as viewed in comoving coordinates. You must calculate\nthe rate at which photons arrive at the detector, and you must also use the fact\nthat the energy of each photon is proportional to its frequency, and is therefore\ndecreased by the redshift. You may find it useful to think of the detector as a small\npart of a sphere that is centered on the source, as shown in the following diagram:\nTotal points for Problem Set 2: 80.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n8.286 The Early Universe\nFall 2013\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

In this problem we will\nconstruct a model of a cylindrical universe, one which is expanding in the x and y\ndirections but which has no motion in the z direction. Instead of a sphere, we will\ndescribe an infinitely long cylinder of radius Rmax,i, with an axis coinciding with\nthe z-axis of the coordinate system:\nWe will use cylindrical coordinates, so\nr =\nx2 + y\n\n8.286 PROBLEM SET 3, FALL 2013\np. 2\nand\nrr\nrr = xˆı + yˆj ;\nrˆ =\n,\nr\nwhere ˆı, ˆj, and kˆ are the usual unit vectors along the x, y, and z axes. We will\nassume that at the initial time ti, the initial density of the cylinder is ρi, and the\ninitial velocity of a particle at position rr is given by the Hubble relation\nrvi = Hir .\n(a) (5 points) By using Gauss' law of gravity, it is possible to show that the grav\nitational acceleration at any point is given by\nAμ\nrg = -\nr ,\nˆ\nr\nwhere A is a constant and μ is the total mass per length contained within the\nradius r. Evaluate the constant A.\n(b) (5 points) As in the lecture notes, we let r(ri, t) denote the trajectory of a\nparticle that starts at radius ri at the initial time ti. Find an expression for\nr (ri, t), expressing the result in terms of r, ri, ρi, and any relevant constants.\n(Here an overdot denotes a time derivative.)\n(c) (5 points) Defining\nr(ri, t)\nu(ri, t) ≡\n,\nri\nshow that u(ri, t) is in fact independent of ri. This implies that the cylinder\nwill undergo uniform expansion, just as the sphere did in the case discussed in\nthe lecture notes. As before, we define the scale factor a(t) ≡ u(ri, t).\n(d) (5 points) Express the mass density ρ(t) in terms of the initial mass density ρi\nand the scale factor a(t). Use this expression to obtain an expression for a in\nterms of a, ρ, and any relevant constants.\n(e) (5 points) Find an expression for a conserved quantity of the form\nE = a 2 + V (a) .\nWhat is V (a)? Will this universe expand forever, or will it collapse?\n\n8.286 PROBLEM SET 3, FALL 2013\np. 3\nPROBLEM 2: A FLAT UNIVERSE WITH UNUSUAL TIME EVOLU\nTION (10 points)\nConsider a flat universe which is filled with some peculiar form of matter, so\nthat the Robertson-Walker scale factor behaves as\na(t) = bt3/4 ,\nwhere b is a constant.\n(a) (5 points) For this universe, find the value of the Hubble expansion rate H(t).\n(b) (5 points) What is the mass density of the universe, ρ(t)? (In answering this\nquestion, you will need to know that the equation for a/a in Lecture Notes 3,\n⎧\n⎪\n⎩ a ⎫\n⎪\n⎭\n8π\nkc2\n=\nGρ -\n,\na2\na\nholds for all forms of matter, while the equation for a,\n4π\na = -\nGρ(t)a ,\nrequires modification if the matter has a significant pressure. The a equation\nis therefore not applicable to this problem.)\nPROBLEM 3: ENERGY AND THE FRIEDMANN EQUATION (30\npoints)\nThe Friedmann equation,\n⎧\n⎪\n⎩ a ⎫\n⎪\n⎭\n8π\nkc2\n=\nGρ -\n,\na2\n(1)\na\nwas derived in Lecture Notes 3 as a first integral of the equations of motion. The\nequation was first derived in a different form,\n4π Gρi\nE = a 2 -\n= constant,\n(2)\na\nwhere k = -2E/c2 . In this form the equation looks more like a conservation of\nenergy relation, although the constant E does not have the dimensions of energy.\nThere are two ways, however, in which the quantity E can be connected to the\nconservation of energy. It is related the energy of a test particle that moves with the\nHubble expansion, and it is also related to the total energy of the entire expanding\n\n8.286 PROBLEM SET 3, FALL 2013\np. 4\nsphere of radius Rmax, which was discussed in Lecture Notes 3 as a method of\nderiving the Friedmann equations. In this problem you will derive these relations.\nFirst, to see the relation with the energy of a test particle moving with the\nHubble expansion, define a physical energy Ephys by\nEphys ≡ mri E ,\n(3)\nwhere m is the mass of the test particle and ri is its initial radius. Note that the\ngravitational force on this particle is given by\nGmM(ri)\nFr = -\nrˆ = -r\n(4)\nDVeff (r) ,\nr\nwhere M(ri) is the total mass initially contained within a radius ri of the origin,\nr is the present distance of the test particle from the origin, and the \"effective\"\npotential energy Veff (r) is given by\nGmM(ri)\nVeff (r) = -\n.\n(5)\nr\nThe motivation for calling this quantity the \"effective\" potential energy will be\nexplained below.\n(a) (10 points) Show that Ephys is equal to the \"effective\" energy of the test particle,\ndefined by\nEeff = mv 2 + Veff (r) .\n(6)\nWe understand that Eeff is conserved because it is the energy in an analogue problem\nin which the test particle moves in the gravitational field of a point particle of mass\nM(ri), located at the origin, with potential energy function Veff (r). In this analogue\nproblem the force on the test particle is exactly the same as in the real problem,\nbut in the analogue problem the energy of the test particle is conserved.\nWe call (6) the \"effective\" energy because it is really the energy of the analogue\nproblem, and not the real problem. The true potential energy V (r, t) of the test\nparticle is defined to be the amount of work we must supply to move the particle\nto its present location from some fixed reference point, which we might take to be\nr = inf. We will not bother to write V (r, t) explicitly, since we will not need it, but we\npoint out that it depends on the time t and on Rmax, and when differentiated gives\nthe correct gravitational force at any radius. By contrast, Veff (r) gives the correct\nforce only at the radius of the test particle, r = a(t)ri. The true potential energy\nfunction V (r, t) gives no conservation law, since it is explicitly time-dependent,\nwhich is why the quantity Veff (r) is useful.\n\n8.286 PROBLEM SET 3, FALL 2013\np. 5\nTo relate E to the total energy of the expanding sphere, we need to integrate over\nthe sphere to determine its total energy.

When you write your solution, you can even copy it verbatim\nfrom these solutions if you wish, although obviously you will learn more if you think\nabout the solution and write your own version.\nIn Lecture Notes 3 we developed a Newtonian model of cosmology, by consid\nering a uniform sphere of mass, centered at the origin, with initial mass density ρi\nand an initial pattern of velocities corresponding to Hubble expansion: rvi = Hir:\n\n8.286 PROBLEM SET 3, FALL 2013\np. 6\nWe denoted the radius at time t of a particle which started at radius ri by the\nfunction r(ri, t). Assuming Newton's law of gravity, we concluded that each particle\nwould experience an acceleration given by\nGM(ri)\nrg = -\nr ,\nˆ\nr2(ri, t)\nwhere M(ri) denotes the total mass contained initially in the region r < ri, given\nby\n4π 3\nM(ri) =\nri ρi .\nSuppose that the law of gravity is modified to contain a new, repulsive term,\nproducing an acceleration which grows as the nth power of the distance, with a\nstrength that is independent of the mass.

In Weinberg's Chapter 4 (and, later, Chapter 5) there are a lot\nof numbers mentioned. You certainly do not need to learn all these numbers,\nbut you should be familiar with the orders of magnitude. In Ryden's Chapters\n4 and 5 (and, later, Chapter 6), the material parallels what we either have\ndone or will be doing in lecture. For these chapters you should consider Ry\nden's book as an aid to understanding the lecture material, and not as a source\nof new material. On the upcoming quizzes, there will be no questions based\nspecifically on the material in these chapters.\nPROBLEM 1: EVOLUTION OF A CLOSED, MATTER-DOMINATED\nUNIVERSE (25 points)\nIt was shown in Lecture Notes 4 that the evolution of a closed, matter-\ndominated universe can be described by introducing the time parameter θ, some\ntimes called the development angle, with\nct = α(θ - sin θ) ,\na\n√ = α(1 - cos θ) ,\nk\nwhere α is a constant with the units of length.\n(a) (6 points) Use these expressions to find H, the Hubble expansion rate, as a\nfunction of α and θ. (Hint: You can use the first of the equations above to\ncalculate dθ/dt.)\n(b) (6 points) Find ρ, the mass density, as a function of α and θ.\n(c) (6 points) Find Ω, where Ω ≡ ρ/ρc, as a function of α and θ. The relation is\ngiven in Lecture Notes 4 as Eq. (4.35), but you should show that you get the\nsame answer by combining your answers from parts (a) and (b) of this question.\n(d) (7 points) Although the evolution of a closed, matter-dominated universe seems\ncomplicated, it is nonetheless possible to carry out the integration needed to\ncompute the horizon distance. The integral becomes simple if one changes the\nvariable of integration so that one integrates over θ instead of integrating over\nt. Show that the physical horizon distance lp,horizon for the closed, matter-\ndominated universe is given by\nlp,horizon = αθ(1 - cos θ) .\n\n8.286 PROBLEM SET 4, FALL 2013\np. 2\nPROBLEM 2: EVOLUTION OF AN OPEN, MATTER-DOMINATED\nUNIVERSE (35 points)\nThe following problem originated on Quiz 2 of 1992 (ancient history!), where it\ncounted 30 points.\nThe equations describing the evolution of an open, matter-dominated universe\nwere given in Lecture Notes 4 as\nct = α (sinh θ - θ)\nand\na\n√ = α (cosh θ - 1) ,\nκ\nwhere α is a constant with units of length. The following mathematical identities,\nwhich you should know, may also prove useful on parts (e) and (f):\n-θ\n-θ\neθ - e\neθ + e\nsinh θ =\n,\ncosh θ =\nθ\nθ2\nθ3\ne θ = 1 +\n+\n+\n+ . . . .\n1!\n2!\n3!\na) (5 points) Find the Hubble expansion rate H as a function of α and θ.\nb) (5 points) Find the mass density ρ as a function of α and θ.\nc) (5 points) Find the mass density parameter Ω as a function of α and θ. As with\npart (c) of the previous problem, the answer to this part appears in Lecture\nNotes 4. However, you should show that you get the same answer by combining\nyour answers to parts (a) and (b) of this question.\nd) (6 points) Find the physical value of the horizon distance, lp,horizon, as a func\ntion of α and θ.\ne) (7 points) For very small values of t, it is possible to use the first nonzero\nterm of a power-series expansion to express θ as a function of t, and then a\nas a function of t. Give the expression for a(t) in this approximation. The\n∗\n∗\napproximation will be valid for t ≪ t . Estimate the value of t .\nf) (7 points) Even though these equations describe an open universe, one still finds\n∗\n∗\nthat Ω approaches one for very early times. For t ≪ t (where t is defined in\npart (e)), the quantity 1 - Ω behaves as a power of t. Find the expression for\n1 - Ω in this approximation.\n\n8.286 PROBLEM SET 4, FALL 2013\np. 3\nPROBLEM\n3:\nTHE\nCRUNCH\nOF\nA\nCLOSED,\nMATTER\nDOMINATED UNIVERSE (25 points)\nThis is Problem 6.5 from Barbara Ryden's Introduction to Cosmology, with\nsome paraphrasing to make it consistent with the language used in lecture.\nConsider a closed universe containing only nonrelativistic matter. This is the\nclosed universe discussed in Lecture Notes 4, and it is also the \"Big Crunch\" model\ndiscussed in Ryden's section 6.1. At some time during the contracting phase (i.e.,\nwhen θ > π), an astronomer named Elbbuh Niwde discovers that nearby galaxies\nhave blueshifts (-1 ≤ z < 0) proportional to their distance. He then measures the\npresent values of the Hubble expansion rate, H0, and the mass density parameter,\nΩ0. He finds, of course, that H0 < 0 (because he is in the contracting phase) and\nΩ0 > 1 (because the universe is closed). In terms of H0 and Ω0, how long a time\nwill elapse between Dr. Niwde's observation at t = t0 and the final Big Crunch at\nt = tCrunch = 2πα/c? Assuming that Dr. Niwde is able to observe all objects within\nhis horizon, what is the most blueshifted (i.e., most negative) value of z that Dr.\nNiwde is able to see? What is the lookback time to an object with this blueshift?\n(By lookback time, one means the difference between the time of observation t0 and\nthe time at which the light was emitted.)\nPROBLEM 4: THE AGE OF A MATTER-DOMINATED UNIVERSE\nAS Ω → 1 (15 points)\nThe age t of a matter-dominated universe, for any value of Ω, was given in\nLecture Notes 4 as\n\n√\n√\n\nΩ\n1 - Ω\n1 - Ω\n\n- arcsinh\nif Ω < 1\n\n2(1 - Ω)3/2\nΩ\nΩ\n\n|H| t =\n2/3\nif Ω= 1\n(4.46)\n\n√\n\n√\n\nΩ\nΩ - 1\nΩ - 1\n\narcsin\n±\n∓\nif Ω > 1\n2(Ω - 1)3/2\nΩ\nΩ\nIt was claimed that this formula is continuous at Ω = 1. In this problem you\nare asked to show half of this statement. Specifically, you should show that as Ω\napproaches 1 from below, the expression for |H|t approaches 2/3. In doing this, you\nmay find it useful to use the Taylor expansion for arcsinh(x) about x = 0:\n(1)2\n(3 · 1)2\n(5 · 3 · 1)2\narcsinh(x) = x -\nx 3 +\nx 5 -\nx 7 + . . . .\n3!\n5!\n7!\nThe proof of continuity as Ω → 0 from above is of course very similar, and you are\nnot asked to show it.\n\n8.286 PROBLEM SET 4, FALL 2013\np. 4\nPROBLEM 5: ISOTROPY ABOUT TWO POINTS IN EUCLIDEAN\nSPACES\n(This problem is not required, but can be done for 15 points extra credit.)\nIn Steven Weinberg's The First Three Minutes, in Chapter 2 on page 24, he\ngives an argument to show that if a space is isotropic about two distinct points,\nthen it is necessarily homogeneous. He is assuming Euclidean geometry, although\nhe is not explicit about this point. (The statement is simply not true if one allows\nnon-Euclidean spaces.) The statement is true for Euclidean spaces, but Weinberg's\nargument is not adequate. He constructs two circles, and then describes an argu\nment based on the properties of the point C at which they intersect. The problem,\nhowever, is that two circles need not intersect. Thus Weinberg's proof is valid for\nsome cases, but cannot be applied to all cases. For 15 points of extra credit, de\nvise a proof that holds in all cases. We have not established axioms for Euclidean\ngeometry, but you may use in your proof any well-known fact about Euclidean\ngeometry.\nTotal points for Problem Set 4: 100, plus 15 points of extra credit.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n8.286 The Early Universe\nFall 2013\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

(This is the Robertson-Walker metric of\nEq. (5.27) of Lecture Notes 5, evaluated at some particular time t, with R ≡ a(t).\nYou should be able to work this problem, however, whether or not you have gotten\nthat far. The problem requires only that you understand what a metric means.)\nConsider a circle described by the equations\nz = 0\nx 2 + y = r\n,\n\n8.286 PROBLEM SET 5, FALL 2013\np. 2\nor equivalently by the angular coordinates\nr = r0\nθ = π/2 .\n(a) (5 points) Find the circumference S of this circle. Hint: break the circle into\ninfinitesimal segments of angular size dφ, calculate the arc length of such a\nsegment, and integrate.\n(b) (5 points) Find the radius ρ of this circle. Note that ρ is the length of a\nline which runs from the origin to the circle (r = r0), along a trajectory of\nθ = π/2 and φ = constant. Hint: Break the line into infinitesimal segments\nof coordinate length dr, calculate the length of such a segment, and integrate.\nConsider the case of open and closed universes separately, and take k = ±1.\n(If you don't remember why we can take k = ±1, see the section called \"Units\"\nin Lecture Notes 3,). You will want the following integrals:\n\ndr\n√\n= sin-1 r\n1 - r2\nand\n\n√ dr\n= sinh-1 r .\n1 + r2\n(c) (5 points) Express the circumference S in terms of the radius ρ. This result is\nindependent of the coordinate system which was used for the calculation, since\nS and ρ are both measurable quantities. Since the space described by this\nmetric is homogeneous and isotropic, the answer does not depend on where the\ncircle is located or on how it is oriented. For the two cases of open and closed\nuniverses, state whether S is larger or smaller than the value it would have for\na Euclidean circle of radius ρ.\nPROBLEM 2: VOLUME OF A CLOSED UNIVERSE (15 points)\nCalculate the total volume of a closed universe, as described by the metric of\nEq. (5.14) of Lecture Notes 5:\nds2 = R2 dψ2 + sin2 ψ dθ2 + sin2 θdφ2\n.\nBreak the volume up into spherical shells of infinitesimal thickness, extending from\nψ to ψ + dψ:\n\n8.286 PROBLEM SET 5, FALL 2013\np. 3\nBy comparing Eq. (5.14) with Eq. (5.8),\nds = R2 dθ2 + sin2 θ dφ2\n,\nthe metric for the surface of a sphere, one can see that as long as ψ is held fixed,\nthe metric for varying θ and φ is the same as that for a spherical surface of radius\nR sin ψ. Thus the area of the spherical surface is 4πR2 sin2 ψ. To find the volume,\nmultiply this area by the thickness of the shell (which you can read off from the\nmetric), and then integrate over the full range of ψ, from 0 to π.\nPROBLEM 3: SURFACE BRIGHTNESS IN A CLOSED UNIVERSE\n(25 points)\nThe spacetime metric for a homogeneous, isotropic, closed universe is given by\nthe Robertson-Walker formula:\ndr2\nds2 = -c 2 dτ 2 = -c 2 dt2 + a 2(t)\n+ r\ndθ2 + sin2 θ dφ2\n,\n1 - r2\nwhere I have taken k = 1. To discuss motion in the radial direction, it is more\nconvenient to work with an alternative radial coordinate ψ, related to r by\nr = sin ψ .\nThen\ndr\n√\n= dψ ,\n1 - r2\nso the metric simplifies to\nds2 = -c 2 dτ 2 = -c 2 dt2 + a 2(t) dψ2 + sin2 ψ dθ2 + sin2 θ dφ2\n.\n\n8.286 PROBLEM SET 5, FALL 2013\np. 4\nThe form of a(t) depends on the nature of the matter in the universe, but for this\nproblem you should consider a(t) to be an arbitrary function. You should simplify\nyour answers as far as it is possible without knowing the function a(t).\n(a) (10 points) Suppose that the Earth is at the center of these coordinates, and\nthat we observe a spherical galaxy that is located at ψ = ψG. The light that\nwe see was emitted from the galaxy at time tG, and is being received today,\nat a time that we call t0. At the time of emission, the galaxy had a power\noutput P (which could be measured, for example, in watts, where 1 watt = 1\njoule/sec). The power was radiated uniformly in all directions, in the form of\nphotons. What is the radiation energy flux J from this galaxy at the Earth\ntoday? Energy flux (which might be measured in joule-m-2-sec-1) is defined\nas the energy per unit area per unit time striking a surface that is orthogonal\nto the direction of the energy flow. [Hint: it is easiest to use a comoving\ncoordinate system with the radiating galaxy at the origin.]\n(b) (10 points) Suppose that the physical diameter of the galaxy at time tG was\nw. Find the apparent angular size ∆θ (measured from one edge to the other)\nof the galaxy as it would be observed from Earth today.\n(c) (5 points) The surface brightness σ of the distant galaxy is defined to be the\nenergy flux J per solid angle subtended by the galaxy.* Calculate the surface\nbrightness σ of the galaxy described in parts (a) and (b). [Hint: if you have the\nright answer, it can be written in terms of P , w, and the redshift z, without\nany reference to ψG. The rapid decrease in σ with z means that high-z galaxies\nare difficult to distinguish from the night sky.]\n* Definition of solid angle: To define the solid angle subtended by the galaxy,\nimagine surrounding the observer by a sphere of arbitrary radius r. The sphere\nshould be small compared to cosmological distances, so that Euclidean geometry is\nvalid within the sphere. If a picture of the galaxy is painted on the surface of the\nsphere so that it just covers the real image, then the solid angle, in steradians, is\nthe area of the picture on the sphere, divided by r .\n\n8.286 PROBLEM SET 5, FALL 2013\np. 5\nPROBLEM 4: TRAJECTORIES AND DISTANCES IN AN OPEN\nUNIVERSE (30 points)\nThe spacetime metric for a homogeneous, isotropic, open universe is given by\nthe Robertson-Walker formula:\ndr2\nds2 = -c 2 dτ 2 = -c 2 dt2 + a 2(t)\n+ r\ndθ2 + sin2 θ dφ2\n,\n1 + r2\nwhere I have taken k = -1. As in Problem 1, for the discussion of radial motion it\nis convenient to introduce an alternative radial coordinate ψ, which in this case is\nrelated to r by\nr = sinh ψ .\nThen\ndr\n√\n= dψ ,\n1 + r2\nso the metric simplifies to\nds2 = -c 2 dτ 2 = -c 2 dt2 + a 2(t) dψ2 + sinh2 ψ dθ2 + sin2 θ dφ2\n.\nYou should treat the function a(t) as a given function. You should simplify your\nanswers as far as it is possible without knowing explicitly the function a(t).\n(a) (5 points) Suppose that the Earth is at the origin of the coordinate system\n(ψ = 0), and that at the present time, t0, we receive a light pulse from a distant\ngalaxy G, located at ψ = ψG. Write down an equation which determines the\ntime tG at which the light pulse left the galaxy. (You may assume that the light\npulse travels on a \"null\" trajectory, which means that dτ = 0 for any segment\nof it. Since you don't know a(t) you cannot solve this equation, so please do\nnot try.)\n(b) (5 points) What is the redshift zG of the light from galaxy G? (Your answer\nmay depend on tG, as well as ψG, t0, or any property of the function a(t).)\n(c) (5 points) To estimate the number of galaxies that one expects to see in a given\nrange of redshifts, it is necessary to know the volume of the region of space\nthat corresponds to this range. Write an expression for the present value of the\nvolume that corresponds to redshifts smaller than that of galaxy G. (You may\nleave your answer in the form of a definite integral, which may be expressed in\nterms of ψG, tG, t0, zG, or the function a(t).)\n(d) (5 points) There are a number of different ways of defining distances in cos\nmology, and generally they are not equal to each other. One choice is called\nproper distance, which corresponds to the distance that one could in princi\nple measure with rulers. The proper distance is defined as the total length of\n\n8.286 PROBLEM SET 5, FALL 2013\np. 6\na network of rulers that are laid end to end from here to the distant galaxy.\nThe rulers have different velocities, because each is at rest with respect to the\nmatter in its own vicinity. They are arranged so that, at the present instant\nof time, each ruler just touches its neighbors on either side. Write down an\nexpression for the proper distance .prop of galaxy G.\n(e) (5 points) Another common definition of distance is angular size distance,\ndetermined by measuring the apparent size of an object of known physical size.\nIn a static, Euclidean space, a small sphere of diameter w at a distance . will\nsubtend an angle ∆θ = w/.:\nMotivated by this relation, cosmologists define the angular size distance .ang\nof an object by\nw\n.ang ≡\n.\n∆θ\nWhat is the angular size distance .ang of galaxy G?\n(f) (5 points) A third common definition of distance is called luminosity dis\ntance, which is determined by measuring the apparent brightness of an object\nfor which the actual total power output is known. In a static, Euclidean space,\nthe energy flux J received from a source of power P at a distance . is given by\n\n8.286 PROBLEM SET 5, FALL 2013\np. 7\nJ = P/(4π.2):\nCosmologists therefore define the luminosity distance by\nP\n.lum ≡\n.\n4πJ\nFind the luminosity distance .lum of galaxy G. (Hint: the Robertson-Walker\ncoordinates can be shifted so that the galaxy G is at the origin.)\nPROBLEM 5: THE KLEIN DESCRIPTION OF THE G-B-L GEOME\nTRY\n(This problem is not required, but can be done for 15 points extra credit.)\nI stated in Lecture Notes 5 that the space invented by Klein, described by the\ndistance relation\nd(1, 2)\n1 - x1x2 - y1y2\ncosh\n=\n\n,\na\n1 - x - y\n1 - x - y\nwhere\nx 2 + y < 1 ,\nis a two-dimensional space of constant negative curvature. In other words, this\nis just a two-dimensional Robertson-Walker metric, as would be described by a\ntwo-dimensional version of Eq. (5.27), with k = -1:\ndr2\nds2 = a\n+ r 2dθ2\n.\n1 + r2\n\n8.286 PROBLEM SET 5, FALL 2013\np. 8\nThe problem is to prove the equivalence.\n(a) (5 points) As a first step, show that if x and y are replaced by the polar\ncoordinates defined by\nx = u cos θ\ny = u sin θ ,\nthen the distance equation can be rewritten as\nd(1, 2)\n1 - u1u2 cos(θ1 - θ2)\ncosh\n=\n.\na\n1 - u1\n1 - u2\n(b) (5 points) The next step is to derive the metric from the distance function\nabove. Let\nu1 = u\nθ1 = θ ,\nu2 = u + du\nθ2 = θ + dθ ,\nand\nd(1, 2) = ds .\nInsert these expressions into the distance function, expand everything to second\norder in the infinitesimal quantities, and show that\ndu2\nu2dθ2\nds2 = a\n+\n.\n(1 - u2)2\n1 - u\n(This part is rather messy, but you should be able to do it.)\n(c) (5 points) Now find the relationship between r and u and show that the two\nmetric functions are identical. Hint: The coefficients of dθ2 must be the same\nin the two cases.

In this sense, gravity is reduced\nto a distortion in spacetime.\nConsider the case of a flat (i.e., k = 0) Robertson-Walker metric, which has\nthe simple form\n\nds2 = -c 2dt2 + a 2(t) dx2 + dy2 + dz2\n.\nSince the spatial metric is flat, we have the option of writing it in terms of Cartesian\nrather than polar coordinates.

Here i runs from 1 to 3, with the\nidentifications x1 ≡ x, x2 ≡ y, and x3 ≡ z. The function φ(Px) depends only on the\nspatial variables Px ≡ (x , x , x3), and not on the time coordinate t.\n(a) (5 points) Suppose that a radio transmitter, located at Pxe, emits a series of\nevenly spaced pulses. The pulses are separated by a proper time interval ΔTe,\nas measured by a clock at the same location. What is the coordinate time inter\nval Δte between the emission of the pulses? (I.e., Δte is the difference between\nthe time coordinate t at the emission of one pulse and the time coordinate t at\nthe emission of the next pulse.)\n(b) (5 points) The pulses are received by an observer at Pxr, who measures the time\nof arrival of each pulse. What is the coordinate time interval Δtr between\nthe reception of successive pulses?\n(c) (5 points) The observer uses his own clocks to measure the proper time interval\nΔTr between the reception of successive pulses. Find this time interval, and\nalso the redshift z, defined by\nΔTr\n1 + z =\n.\nΔTe\nFirst compute an exact expression for z, and then expand the answer to lowest\norder in φ(Px) to obtain a weak-field approximation. (This weak-field approxi\nmation is in fact highly accurate in all terrestrial and solar system applications.)\n(d) (5 points) A freely falling particle travels on a spacetime geodesic xμ(τ), where\nτ is the proper time. (I.e., τ is the time that would be measured by a clock\nmoving with the particle.) The trajectory is described by the geodesic equation\nd\ndxν\ndxλ dxσ\ngμν\n=\n(∂μgλσ)\n,\ndτ\ndτ\ndτ dτ\nwhere the Greek indices (μ, ν, λ, σ, etc.) run from 0 to 3, and are summed over\nwhen repeated.

(It is acceptable to leave quantities such as dt/dτ or\ndxi/dτ in the answer.)\n(e) (5 points) In the weak-field nonrelativistic-velocity approximation, the answer\nto the previous part reduces to\nd2 i\nx = -∂iφ ,\ndt2\nso φ(Px) can be identified as the Newtonian gravitational potential. Use this\nfact to estimate the gravitational redshift z of a photon that rises from the\nfloor of this room to the ceiling (say 4 meters). (One significant figure will be\nsufficient.)\nPROBLEM 3: CIRCULAR ORBITS IN A SCHWARZSCHILD MET\nRIC (30 points)\nREAD THIS: This problem was Problem 16 of Review Problems for Quiz 2 of\n2011, and the solution is posted as http://web.mit.edu/8.286/www/quiz11/ecqr2\n1.pdf. Like Problem 4 of Problem Set 3, but unlike all other homework problems so\nfar, in this case you are encouraged to look at the solutions and benefit from them.\nWhen you write your solution, you can even copy it verbatim from these solutions\nif you wish, although obviously you will learn more if you think about the solution\nand write your own version.\nThe Schwarzschild metric, which describes the external gravitational field of\nany spherically symmetric distribution of mass, is given by\n2GM\n2GM\n-1\nds2 = -c 2dτ 2 = - 1 -\nc 2dt2 +\n1 -\ndr2 + r 2dθ2 + r 2 sin2 θ dφ2 ,\nrc\nrc\nwhere M is the total mass of the object, 0 ≤ θ ≤ π, 0 ≤ φ < 2π, and φ =\n2π is identified with φ = 0. We will be concerned only with motion outside the\nSchwarzschild horizon RS = 2GM/c2, so we can take r > RS . (This restriction\nallows us to avoid the complications of understanding the effects of the singularity\nat r = RS .) In this problem we will use the geodesic equation to calculate the\nbehavior of circular orbits in this metric. We will assume a perfectly circular orbit\nin the x-y plane: the radial coordinate r is fixed, θ = 90*, and φ = ωt, for some\nangular velocity ω.\n(a) (7 points) Use the metric to find the proper time interval dτ for a segment of the\npath corresponding to a coordinate time interval dt. Note that dτ represents\nthe time that would actually be measured by a clock moving with the orbiting\nbody. Your result should show that\n\n2ω2\ndτ\n2GM\nr\n=\n1 -\n-\n.\ndt\nrc2\nc2\n\n8.286 PROBLEM SET 6, FALL 2013\np. 4\nNote that for M = 0 this reduces to the special relativistic relation dτ/dt =\n-\n1 - v2/c2, but the extra term proportional to M describes an effect that is\nnew with general relativity-- the gravitational field causes clocks to slow down,\njust as motion does.\n(b) (7 points) Show that the geodesic equation of motion (Eq. (5.65)) for one of\nthe coordinates takes the form\n1 ∂gφφ\ndφ\n1 ∂gtt\ndt\n0 =\n+\n.\n2 ∂r\ndτ\n2 ∂r\ndτ\n(c) (8 points) Show that the above equation implies\ndφ\nGM\ndt\nr\n=\n,\ndτ\nr\ndτ\nwhich in turn implies that\nGM\nrω2 =\n.\nr\nThus, the relation between r and ω is exactly the same as in Newtonian me\nchanics. [Note, however, that this does not really mean that general relativity\nhas no effect. First, ω has been defined by dφ/dt, where t is a time coordi\nnate which is not the same as the proper time τ that would be measured by a\nclock on the orbiting body. Second, r does not really have the same meaning\nas in the Newtonian calculation, since it is not the measured distance from the\ncenter of motion. Measured distances, you will recall, are calculated by inte\ngrating the metric, as for example in Problem 1 of Problem Set 5, A Circle\nin a Non-Euclidean Geometry. Since the angular (dθ2 and dφ2) terms in the\nSchwarzschild metric are unaffected by the mass, however, it can be seen that\nthe circumference of the circle is equal to 2πr, as in the Newtonian calculation.]\n(d) (8 points) Show that circular orbits around a black hole have a minimum value\nof the radial coordinate r, which is larger than RS . What is it?\nPROBLEM 4: GAS PRESSURE AND ENERGY CONSERVATION (25\npoints)\nIn this problem we will pursue the implications of the conservation of energy.\nConsider first a gas contained in a chamber with a movable piston, as shown below:\n\n8.286 PROBLEM SET 6, FALL 2013\np. 5\nLet U denote the total energy of the gas, and let p denote the pressure. Suppose\nthat the piston is moved a distance dx to the right. (We suppose that the motion\nis slow, so that the gas particles have time to respond and to maintain a uniform\npressure throughout the volume.) The gas exerts a force pA on the piston, so the\ngas does work dW = pAdx as the piston is moved. Note that the volume increases\nby an amount dV = Adx, so dW = pdV . The energy of the gas decreases by this\namount, so\ndU = -pdV .\n(P4.1)\nIt turns out that this relation is valid whenever the volume of a gas is changed,\nregardless of the shape of the volume.\nNow consider a homogeneous, isotropic, expanding universe, described by a\nscale factor a(t). Let u denote the energy density of the gas that fills it. (Remember\nthat u = ρc2, where ρ is the mass density of the gas.) We will consider a fixed\ncoordinate volume Vcoord, so the physical volume will vary as\nVphys(t) = a 3(t)Vcoord .\n(P4.2)\nThe energy of the gas in this region is then given by\nU = Vphysu .\n(P4.3)\n(a) (9 points) Using these relations, show that\nd a 3ρc2 = -p d (a 3) ,\n(P4.4)\ndt\ndt\nand then that\n\na\np\nρ = -3\nρ +\n,\n(P4.5)\na\nc\nwhere the dot denotes differentiation with respect to t.\n(b) (8 points) The scale factor evolves according to the relation\na\n8π\nkc2\n=\nGρ -\n.\n(P4.6)\na\na2\nUsing Eqs. (P4.5) and (P4.6), show that\n4π\n3p\na = -\nG\nρ +\na .\n(P4.7)\nc2\nThis equation describes directly the deceleration of the cosmic expansion. Note\nthat there are contributions from the mass density ρ, but also from the pressure\np.\n(c) (8 points) So far our equations have been valid for any sort of a gas, but let us\nnow specialize to the case of black-body radiation. For this case we know that\nρ = bT 4, where b is a constant and T is the temperature. We also know that as\nthe universe expands, aT remains constant. Using these facts and Eq. (P4.5),\nfind an expression for p in terms of ρ.\n\n8.286 PROBLEM SET 6, FALL 2013\np. 6\nPROBLEM 5: THE EFFECT OF PRESSURE ON COSMOLOGICAL\nEVOLUTION (25 points)\nA radiation-dominated universe behaves differently from a matter-dominated\nuniverse because the pressure of the radiation is significant. In this problem we\nexplore the role of pressure for several fictitious forms of matter.\n(a) (8 points) For the first fictitious form of matter, the mass density ρ decreases\nas the scale factor a(t) grows, with the relation\nρ(t) ∝\n.\na6(t)\nWhat is the pressure of this form of matter? [Hint: the answer is proportional\nto the mass density.]\n(b) (9 points) Find the behavior of the scale factor a(t) for a flat universe dominated\nby the form of matter described in part (a). You should be able to determine\nthe function a(t) up to a constant factor.\n(c) (8 points) Now consider a universe dominated by a different form of fictitious\nmatter, with a pressure given by\np = ρc2 .\nAs the universe expands, the mass density of this form of matter behaves as\nρ(t) ∝\n.\nan(t)\nFind the power n.\nPROBLEM 6: TIME EVOLUTION OF A UNIVERSE WITH MYSTE\nRIOUS STUFF (15 points)\nSuppose that a model universe is filled with a peculiar form of matter for which\nρ ∝\n.\na5(t)\nAssuming that the model universe is flat, calculate\n(a) (4 points) The behavior of the scale factor, a(t).

In the temperature range\nof 1 MeV < kT < 100 MeV, the mass density of the universe is believed to have\nbeen dominated by the black-body radiation of photons, electron-positron pairs,\nand these neutrinos, all of which were in thermal equilibrium.\n(a) (5 points) Under these assumptions, how long did it take (starting from the\ninstant of the big bang) for the temperature to fall to the value such that\nkT = 1 MeV?\n(b) (5 points) How much time would it have taken if there were one other species\nof massless neutrino, in addition to the three which we are currently assuming?\n(c) (5 points) What would be the mass density of the universe when kT = 1 MeV\nunder the standard assumptions, and what would it be if there were one other\nspecies of massless neutrino?\nTotal points for Problem Set 6: 160.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n8.286 The Early Universe\nFall 2013\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

The derivation of this formula has been left to the statistical mechanics\ncourse that you either have taken or hopefully will take. For our purposes, the\nimportant point is that the early universe remains very close to thermal equilibrium,\nand therefore entropy is conserved. The conservation of entropy applies even during\nperiods when particles, such as electron-positron pairs, are \"freezing out\" of the\nthermal equilibrium mix. Since total entropy is conserved, the entropy density falls\noff as 1/a3(t).\nWhen the electron-positron pairs disappear from the thermal equilibrium mix\nture as kT falls below mec2 = 0.511 MeV, the weak interactions have such low cross\nsections that the neutrinos have essentially decoupled. To a good approximation, all\nof the energy and entropy released by the annihilation of electrons and positrons is\nadded to the photon gas, and the neutrinos are unaffected. Use these facts to show\nthat as electron-positron pair annihilation takes place, aTγ increases by a factor of\n(11/4)1/3, while aTν remains constant. It follows that after the disappearance of\nthe electron-positron pairs, Tν /Tγ = (4/11)1/3 . As far as we know, nothing hap\npens that significantly effects this ratio right up to the present day. So we expect\ntoday a background of thermal neutrinos which are slightly colder than the 2.7*K\nbackground of photons.\n\n8.286 PROBLEM SET 7, FALL 2013\np. 2\nPROBLEM 2: FREEZE-OUT OF MUONS (25 points)\nA particle called the muon seems to be essentially identical to the electron,\nexcept that it is heavier-- the mass/energy of a muon is 106 MeV, compared to\n0.511 MeV for the electron. The muon (μ-) has the same charge as an electron,\ndenoted by -e. There is also an antimuon (μ+), analogous to the positron, with\ncharge +e. The muon and antimuon have the same spin as the electron. There is\nno known particle with a mass between that of an electron and that of a muon.\n(a) The formula for the energy density of black-body radiation, as given by\nEq. (6.48) of the lecture notes,\nπ2 (kT )4\nu = g\n,\n30 ( hc)3\nis written in terms of a normalization constant g. What is the value of g for\n+\n-\nthe muons, taking μ\nand μ\ntogether?\n(b) When kT is just above 106 MeV as the universe cools, what particles besides\nthe muons are contained in the thermal radiation that fills the universe? What\nis the contribution to g from each of these particles?\n(c) As kT falls below 106 MeV, the muons disappear from the thermal equilibrium\nradiation. At these temperatures all of the other particles in the black-body\nradiation are interacting fast enough to maintain equilibrium, so the heat given\noff from the muons is shared among all the other particles. Letting a denote the\nRobertson-Walker scale factor, by what factor does the quantity aT increase\nwhen the muons disappear?\nPROBLEM 3: THE REDSHIFT OF THE COSMIC MICROWAVE\nBACKGROUND (25 points)\nIt was mentioned in Lecture Notes 6 that the black-body spectrum has the\npeculiar feature that it maintains its form under uniform redshift. That is, as\nthe universe expands, even if the photons do not interact with anything, they will\ncontinue to be described by a black-body spectrum, although at a temperature\nthat decreases as the universe expands. Thus, even though the cosmic microwave\nbackground (CMB) has not been interacting significantly with matter since 350,000\nyears after the big bang, the radiation today still has a black-body spectrum. In this\nproblem we will demonstrate this important property of the black-body spectrum.\nThe spectral energy density ρν (ν, T ) for the thermal (black-body) radiation of\nphotons at temperature T was stated in Lecture Notes 6 as Eq. (6.71), which we\ncan rewrite as\n16π2\nhν3\nρν (ν, T ) =\n,\n(P3.1)\nhν/kT - 1\nc\ne\n\n8.286 PROBLEM SET 7, FALL 2013\np. 3\nwhere h = 2π h is Planck's original constant. ρν (ν, T ) dν is the energy per unit\nvolume carried by photons whose frequency is in the interval [ν, ν + dν]. In this\nproblem we will assume that this formula holds at some initial time t1, when the\ntemperature had some value T1. We will let ρ(ν, t) denote the spectral distribution\nfor photons in the universe, which is a function of frequency ν and time t. Thus,\nour assumption about the initial condition can be expressed as\nρ (ν, t1) = ρν (ν, T1) .\n(P3.2)\nThe photons redshift as the universe expands, and to a good approximation\nthe redshift and the dilution of photons due to the expansion are the only physical\neffects that cause the distribution of photons to evolve. Thus, using our knowledge\nof the redshift, we can calculate the spectral distribution ρ(ν, t2) at some later time\nt2 > t1. It is not obvious that ρ(ν, t2) will be a thermal distribution, but in fact we\nwill be able to show that\n\nρ (ν, t2) = ρ ν, T (t2) ,\n(P3.3)\nwhere in fact T (t2) will agree with what we already know about the evolution of T\nin a radiation-dominated universe:\na(t1)\nT (t2) =\nT1 .\n(P3.4)\na(t2)\nTo follow the evolution of the photons from time t1 to time t2, we can imagine\nselecting a region of comoving coordinates with coordinate volume Vc. Within this\ncomoving volume, we can imagine tagging all the photons in a specified infinitesimal\nrange of frequencies, those between ν1 and ν1 + dν1. Recalling that the energy of\neach such photon is hν, the number dN1 of tagged photons is then\nρ (ν1, t1) a3(t1) Vc dν1\ndN1 =\n.\n(P3.5)\nhν1\n(a) We now wish to follow the photons in this frequency range from time t1 to time\nt2, during which time each photon redshifts. At the latter time we can denote\nthe range of frequencies by ν2 to ν2 + dν2. Express ν2 and dν2 in terms of ν1\nand dν1, assuming that the scale factor a(t) is given.\n(b) At time t2 we can imagine tagging all the photons in the frequency range ν2 to\nν2 +dν2 that are found in the original comoving region with coordinate volume\nVc. Explain why the number dN2 of such photons, on average, will equal dN1\nas calculated in Eq. (P3.5).\n\n8.286 PROBLEM SET 7, FALL 2013\np. 4\n(c) Since ρ(ν, t2) denotes the spectral energy density at time t2, we can write\nρ (ν2, t2) a3(t2) Vc dν2\ndN2 =\n,\n(P3.6)\nhν2\nusing the same logic as in Eq. (P3.5). Use dN2 = dN1 to show that\na3(t1)\nρ (ν2, t2) =\nρ (ν1, t1) .\n(P3.7)\na3(t2)\nUse the above equation to show that Eq. (P3.3) is satisfied, for T (t) given by\nEq.

REDSHIFT WITH A POSSIBLE\nCOSMOLOGICAL CONSTANT (25 points)\nIn Lecture Notes 7, we derived the relation between the power output P of a\nsource and the energy flux J, for the case of a closed universe:\nPH0\n2|Ωk,0|\nJ =\n,\n4π(1 + zS)2c2 sin2 ψD\nwhere\n\nzS\ndz\nψD =\n|Ωk,0|\n\n.\nΩm,0(1 + z)3 + Ωrad,0(1 + z)4 + Ωvac,0 + Ωk,0(1 + z)2\nHere zS denotes the observed redshift, H0 denotes the present value of the Hub\nble constant, Ωm,0, Ωrad,0, and Ωvac,0 denote the present contributions to Ω from\nnonrelativistic matter, radiation, and vacuum energy, respectively, and Ωk,0 ≡\n1 - Ωm,0 - Ωrad,0 - Ωvac,0.\n(a) Derive the corresponding formula for the case of an open universe.

Like Problem 4 of Problem Set 3 and Problem 3 of Problem Set 6, but unlike\nall other homework problems so far, in this case you are encouraged to look at the\nsolutions and benefit from them. When you write your solution, you can even copy\nit verbatim from these solutions if you wish, although obviously you will learn more\nif you think about the solution and write your own version.\nConsider a universe that contains nonrelativistic matter, radiation, vacuum\nenergy, and the same mysterious stuff that was introduced in Problem 7 of Review\nProblems for Quiz 3, from 2011. Since the mass density of mysterious stuff falls off\n√\nas 1/\nV , where V is the volume, it follows that in an expanding universe the mass\ndensity of mysterious stuff falls off as 1/a3/2(t).\nSuppose that you are given the present value of the Hubble parameter H0,\nand also the present values of the contributions to Ω ≡ ρ/ρc from each of the\nconstituents: Ωm,0 (nonrelativistic matter), Ωr,0 (radiation), Ωv,0 (vacuum energy\ndensity), and Ωms,0 (mysterious stuff). Our goal is to express the age of the universe\nt0 in terms of these quantities.\n(a) (10 points) Let x(t) denote the ratio\na(t)\nx(t) ≡ a(t0)\nfor an arbitrary time t. Write an expression for the total mass density of the\nuniverse ρ(t) in terms of x(t) and the given quantities described above.\n(b) (10 points) Write an integral expression for the age of the universe t0. The\nexpression should depend only on H0 and the various contributions to Ω0 listed\nabove (Ωm,0 , Ωr,0 , etc.), but it might include x as a variable of integration.\nPROBLEM 3: SHARED CAUSAL PAST (20 points)\nRecently several of my colleagues published a paper (Andrew S. Friedman,\nDavid I. Kaiser, and Jason Gallicchio, \"The Shared Causal Pasts and Futures of\nCosmological Events,\" http://arxiv.org/abs/arXiv:1305.3943, Physical Review D,\nVol. 88, article 044038 (2013)) in which they investigated the causal connections in\nthe standard cosmological model. In particular, they calculated the present redshift\nz of a distant quasar which has the property that a light signal, if sent from our\nown location at the instant of the big bang, would have just enough time to reach\nthe quasar and return to us, so that we could see the reflection of the signal at\nthe present time. They found z = 3.65, using Ωvac,0 = 0.685, Ωmatter,0 = 0.315,\nΩrad,0 = 0, and H0 = 67.3 km-s-1-Mpc-1 . Feel free to read their paper if you\nlike. Your job, however, is to carry out an independent calculation to find out if\nthey got it right.

Specifically, calculate numerical values for J/(PH2) as\na function of z, for Ωm,0 = 0.3 and Ωvac,0 = 0.7. Compute a table of values for\nz = 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, . . ., 1.5. Feel free to attach a computer printout of these results, but\nbe sure that it is labeled well enough to be readable to someone other than yourself.\n(If you are not confident in the expression that you obtained in Problem 4 for the\nflat universe case, you can for equal credit do this problem for an open universe,\nwith Ωm,0 = 0.3 and Ωvac,0 = 0.6.) For pedagogical purposes you are asked to\ncompute these numbers to 5 significant figures, although one does not need nearly\nso much accuracy to compare with data. For the fun of it, the solutions will be\nwritten to 15 significant figures. Note that the speed of light is now defined to be\n299,792,458 m/s.\nPROBLEM 5: PLOTTING THE SUPERNOVA DATA (EXTRA CREDIT,\n20 pts)\nThe original data on the Hubble diagram based on Type Ia supernovae are\nfound in two papers. One paper is authored by the High Z Supernova Search Team,*\nand the other is by the Supernova Cosmology Project.+ More recent data from the\nHigh Z team, which includes many more data points, can be found in Riess et\nal., http://arXiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0402512.¶ (By the way, the lead author Adam\nRiess was an MIT undergraduate physics major, graduating in 1992.)\nYou are asked to plot the data from either the 2nd or 3rd of these papers, and\nto include on the graph the theoretical predictions for several cosmological models.\nThe plot will be similar to the plots contained in these papers, and to the plot\non p. 121 of Ryden's book, showing a graph of (corrected) magnitude m vs. redshift\nz. Your graph should include the error bars. If you plot the Perlmutter et al. data,\nyou will be plotting \"effective magnitude\" m vs. redshift z. The magnitude is related\nto the flux J of the observed radiation by m = - 5 log10(J)+const. The value of the\nconstant in this expression will not be needed. The word \"corrected\" refers both to\ncorrections related to the spectral sensitivity of the detectors and to the brightness\n* http://arXiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9805201, later published as Riess et al., Astro\nnomical Journal 116, 1009 (1998).\n+ http://arXiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9812133, later published as Perlmutter et al.,\nAstrophysical Journal 517:565-586 (1999).\n¶ Published as Astrophysical Journal 607:665-687 (2004).\n\n8.286 PROBLEM SET 8, FALL 2013\np. 4\nof the supernova explosions themselves. That is, the supernova at various distances\nare observed with different redshifts, and hence one must apply corrections if the\ndetectors used to measure the radiation do not have the same sensitivity at all\nwavelengths. In addition, to improve the uniformity of the supernova as standard\ncandles, the astronomers apply a correction based on the duration of the light\noutput. Note that our ignorance of the absolute brightness of the supernova, of\nthe precise value of the Hubble constant, and of the constant that appears in the\ndefinition of magnitude all combine to give an unknown but constant contribution\nto the predicted magnitudes. The consequence is that you will be able to move your\npredicted curves up or down (i.e., translate them by a fixed distance along the m\naxis). You should choose the vertical positioning of your curve to optimize your fit,\neither by eyeball or by some more systematic method.\nIf you choose to plot the data from the 3rd paper, Riess et al. 2004, then you\nshould see the note at the end of this problem.\nFor your convenience, the magnitudes and redshifts for the Supernova Cosmol\nogy Project paper, from Tables 1 and 2, are summarized in a text file on the 8.286\nweb page. The data from Table 5 of the Riess et al. 2004 paper, mentioned above,\nis also posted on the 8.286 web page.\nFor the cosmological models to plot, you should include:\n(i) A matter-dominated universe with Ωm = 1.\n(ii) An open universe, with Ωm,0 = 0.3.\n(iii) A universe with Ωm,0 = 0.3 and a cosmological constant, with Ωvac,0 = 0.7. (If\nyou prefer to avoid the flat case, you can use Ωvac,0 = 0.6. Or, if you want to\ncompare directly with Figure 4 of the Riess et al. (2004) paper, you should use\nΩm,0 = 0.29, Ωvac,0 = 0.71.)\nYou may include any other models if they interest you. You can draw the plot\nwith either a linear or a logarithmic scale in z. I would recommend extending your\ntheoretical plot to z = 3, if you do it logarithmically, or z = 2 if you do it linearly,\neven though the data does not go out that far. That way you can see what possible\nknowledge can be gained by data at higher redshift.\nNOTE FOR THOSE PLOTTING DATA FROM RIESS ET AL. 2004:\nUnlike the Perlmutter et al. data, the Riess et al. data is expressed in terms\nof the distance modulus, which is a direct measure of the luminosity distance. The\ndistance modulus is defined both in the Riess et al. paper and in Ryden's book\n(p. 120) as\n\ndL\nμ = 5 log10\n+ 25 ,\n1 Mpc\nwhere Ryden uses the notation m - M for the distance modulus, and dL is the\nluminosity distance. The luminosity distance, in turn, is really a measure of the\n\n8.286 PROBLEM SET 8, FALL 2013\np. 5\nobserved brightness of the object. It is defined as the distance that the object would\nhave to be located to result in the observed brightness, if we were living in a static\nEuclidean universe. More explicitly, if we lived in a static Euclidean universe and\nan object radiated power P in a spherically symmetric pattern, then the energy flux\nJ at a distance d would be\nP\nJ =\n.\n4πd2\nThat is, the power would be distributed uniformly over the surface of a sphere at\nradius d. The luminosity distance is therefore defined as\nP\ndL =\n.\n4πJ\nThus, a specified value of the distance modulus μ implies a definite value of the\nratio J/P.\nIn plotting a theoretical curve, you will need to choose a value for H0. Riess\net al. do not specify what value they used, but I found that their curve is most\nclosely reproduced if I choose H0 = 66 km-sec-1-Mpc-1 . This seems a little on\nthe low side, since the value is usually estimated as 70-72 km-sec-1-Mpc-1, but\nRiess et al. emphasize that they were not concerned with this value. They were\nconcerned with the relative values of the distance moduli, and hence the shape of\nthe graph of the distance modulus vs. z. In their own words, from Appendix A,\n\"The zeropoint, distance scale, absolute magnitude of the fiducial SN Ia or Hubble\nconstant derived from Table 5 are all closely related (or even equivalent) quantities\nwhich were arbitrarily set for the sample presented here. Their correct value is not\nrelevant for the analyses presented which only make use of differences between SN Ia\nmagnitudes. Thus the analysis are independent of the aforementioned normalization\nparameters.\"\nTotal points for Problem Set 8: 65, plus an optional 40 points of extra\ncredit.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n8.286 The Early Universe\nFall 2013\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

(25 points)\n(a) (5 points)\nWeinberg used the diagram above to explain an important property of the\nHubble expansion law. What property was it. Explain in one or a few sentences\nhow this diagram illustrates the property in question.\n(b) (5 points)\nThe\ndiagram\non the\nright shows the Planck spectrum for\nblack-body radiation at 3.0 K, as\nused in Weinberg's book. Weinberg\nexplained that the intensity of black-\nbody radiation falls offat long wave-\nlengths because \"it is hard to fit ra-\ndiation into any volume whose di-\nmensions are smaller than the wave-\nlength.\" In one or a few sentences,\nwhat is is reason for the suppression\nin intensity at short wavelengths?\n(c) (5 points) The label CN on the dia-\ngram at the right refers to cyanogen,\na radical consisting of one car-\nbon and one nitrogen atom.\nIn\none or a few sentences, what does\ncyanogen have to do with black-\nbody radiation?\n(d) (5 points) Another label in the diagram above is \"Penzias & Wilson.\" What\ndiscovery did they make (3 points), and where were they employed (2 points)?\n-- Problem 1 continues on next page --\n\n8.286 QUIZ 1, FALL 2013\np. 3\n(e) (5 points) Ryden used the teddy-\nbear diagram at the right to il-\nlustrate an important property of\ngeneral relativity. What property\nwas it? Explain in one or a few\nsentences how this diagram illus-\ntrates the property in question.\nA\nmoving box and a fixed box with a teddy-bear inside.\nImage by MIT OpenCourseWare.\n\n8.286 QUIZ 1, FALL 2013\np. 4\nPROBLEM 2:\nAN EXPONENTIALLY EXPANDING FLAT UNI-\nVERSE (30 points)\nConsider a flat (i.e., a k = 0, or a Euclidean) universe with scale factor given\nby\na(t) = a0eχt ,\nwhere a0 and χ are constants.\n(a) (5 points) Consider two galaxies which at some time t1 are separated by a\nphysical distance lp.\nAt this time one galaxy emits a pulse of light in the\ndirection of the other. If the light pulse is received at the second galaxy at\ntime t2, what is the redshift z? (Recall that 1 + z is the factor by which the\nwavelength or the period of the light wave is increased.)\nYour answer can\ndepend on any or all of the quantities a0, χ, c, t1 t2, and lp.\n(b) (10 points) At what time t2 does the second galaxy receive the light pulse?\nYour answer should depend only on one or more of the quantities c, a0, χ, lp,\nand t1, but not on z.\n(c) (5 points) Is it possible for lp to be so large that the light pulse is never received\nby the second galaxy? If so, how large must lp be for this to happen?\n(d) (5 points) At what time teq is the light ray equidistant between the two galaxies?\n(e) (5 points) If the light pulse has duration ∆t when it is emitted, as measured by\nobservers on the emitting galaxy, what is the duration measured by observers\non the receiving galaxy? (Assume that ∆t is small compared to cosmological\ntime scales, such as t2 -t1, or χ-1.) The answer can depend on any or all of\na0, χ, c, t1, t2, lp, z, or ∆t.\n\n8.286 QUIZ 1, FALL 2013\np. 5\nPROBLEM 3: A CYLINDRICAL UNIVERSE (25 points)\nThe following problem was on Problem Set 3 this year.\nThe lecture notes showed a construction of a Newtonian model of the universe\nthat was based on a uniform, expanding, sphere of matter. In this problem we will\nconstruct a model of a cylindrical universe, one which is expanding in the x and y\ndirections but which has no motion in the z direction. Instead of a sphere, we will\ndescribe an infinitely long cylinder of radius Rmax,i, with an axis coinciding with\nthe z-axis of the coordinate system:\nWe will use cylindrical coordinates, so\nr =\nan\n\nx2 + y2\nd\nr\nr = xˆı + yˆ;\nˆr =\n,\nr\nwhere ˆı, ˆ, and kˆ are the usual unit vectors along the x, y, and z axes. We will\nassume that at the initial time ti, the initial density of the cylinder is ρi, and the\ninitial velocity of a particle at position r is given by the Hubble relation\nvi = Hir .\n-- Problem 3 continues on next page --\n\n8.286 QUIZ 1, FALL 2013\np. 6\n(a) (5 points) By using Gauss' law of gravity, it is possible to show that the grav-\nitational acceleration at any point is given by\nAμ\ng = -\nr ,\nˆ\nr\nwhere A is a constant and μ is the total mass per length contained within the\nradius r. Evaluate the constant A.\n(b) (5 points) As in the lecture notes, we let r(ri, t) denote the trajectory of a\nparticle that starts at radius ri at the initial time ti. Find an expression for\nr (ri, t), expressing the result in terms of r, ri, ρi, and any relevant constants.\n(Here an overdot denotes a time derivative.)\n(c) (5 points) Defining\nr(r\nu(ri, t) ≡\ni, t) ,\nri\nshow that u(ri, t) is in fact independent of ri. This implies that the cylinder\nwill undergo uniform expansion, just as the sphere did in the case discussed in\nthe lecture notes. As before, we define the scale factor a(t) ≡u(ri, t).\n(d) (5 points) Express the mass density ρ(t) in terms of the initial mass density ρi\nand the scale factor a(t). Use this expression to obtain an expression for a in\nterms of a, ρ, and any relevant constants.\n(e) (5 points) Find an expression for a conserved quantity of the form\nE =\na 2 + V (a) .\nWhat is V (a)? Will this universe expand forever, or will it collapse?\n\n8.286 QUIZ 1, FALL 2013\np. 7\nPROBLEM 4: ANGULAR SIZE AND RADIATION FLUX RECEIVED\nFROM A DISTANT GALAXY (25 points)\n(a) (10 points) Suppose that we observe a distant galaxy that currently has a\nphysical (proper) distance lp = a(t0)lc, where t0 as usual denotes the current\ntime, and a(t) is the scale factor. Treat the galaxy as a sphere, which had\n(physical) radius R1 at the time of emission, and R0 today. Suppose that we\ndo not know the form of the function a(t), but we do know the redshift z with\nwhich the radiation is received. In terms of some or all of the quantities c, t0,\nR0, R1, lp, and z, what is the angle θ that the distant galaxy subtends in our\nview. You should assume that θ ≪1.\n(b) (15 points) Suppose that the galaxy had power output P (measured, say, in\njoules per second, also called watts) at the time of emission, and assume that\nthe power was radiated uniformly in all directions.\nWhat is the radiation\nenergy flux J from this galaxy at the Earth today? Energy flux (which might\nbe measured in watts per square meter) is defined as the energy per unit area\nper unit time striking a surface that is orthogonal to the direction of energy\nflow. Express your answer in terms of some or all of the quantities c, t0, R0,\nR1, lp, z, and P.\n\n8.286 QUIZ 1, FALL 2013\np. 8\nProblem\nMaximum\nScore\nTOTAL\n\n8.286 QUIZ 1, FALL 2013\np. 9\nMASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY\nPhysics Department\nPhysics 8.286: The Early Universe\nOctober 3, 2013\nProf. Alan Guth\nQUIZ 1 FORMULA SHEET\nDOPPLER SHIFT (For motion along a line):\nz = v/u\n(nonrelativistic, source moving)\nv/u\nz =\n(nonrelativistic, observer moving)\n1 -v/u\nz =\n\n1 + β -1\n(special relativity, with β = v/c)\n1 -β\nCOSMOLOGICAL REDSHIFT:\nλ\nt\n1 +\n≡\nobserved\na(\n=\nobserved)\nz\nλemitted\na(temitted)\nSPECIAL RELATIVITY:\nTime Dilation Factor:\nγ ≡\n,\nβ\nv/\nβ2\n≡\nc\n-\nLorentz-Fitzgerald Contraction Factor:\nγ\nRelativity of Simultaneity:\nTrailing clock reads later by an amount βl0/c .\nEVOLUTION OF A MATTER-DOMINATED\nUNIVERSE:\na\n8π\nkc2\n4π\nH\n=\n=\nGρ\na\n-\n,\na =\na2\n-\nGρa ,\na3(t )\n(t) =\ni\nρ\nρ(t\na3(t)\ni)\n3H2\nΩ≡ρ/ρc ,\nwhere ρc =\n.\n8πG\nFlat (k = 0):\na(t) ∝t2/3 ,\nΩ= 1 .\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n8.286 The Early Universe\nFall 2013\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

(While all of Ryden's Chapter\n3 has been assigned, questions on the quiz will be limited to Section 3.1. The\nmaterial in Sections 3.2 and 3.3 will be discussed in lecture later in the course,\nand you will not be responsible for it until then. Section 3.4 (for the κ = 0\ncase) may help you understand the cosmological Doppler shift, also discussed in\nLecture Notes 2, but there will be no questions specifically focussed on Ryden's\ndiscussion.) One of the problems on the quiz will be taken verbatim\n(or at least almost verbatim) from either the homework assignments,\nor from the starred problems from this set of Review Problems. The\nstarred problems are the ones that I recommend that you review most care-\nfully: Problems 2, 4, 7, 12, 15, 17, 19, and 22.\nThe starred problems do\nnot include any reading questions, but parts of the reading questions in these\nReview Problems may also recur on the upcoming quiz.\nPURPOSE: These review problems are not to be handed in, but are being made\navailable to help you study. They come mainly from quizzes in previous years.\nExcept for a few parts which are clearly marked, they are all problems that I\nwould consider fair for the coming quiz.

(35 points)\nThe following problem was Problem 1, Quiz 1, 2000. The parts were each worth 5\npoints.\na) The Doppler effect for both sound and light waves is named for Johann Chris-\ntian Doppler, a professor of mathematics at the Realschule in Prague.\nHe\npredicted the effect for both types of waves in xx42. What are the two digits\nxx?\nb) When the sky is very clear (as it almost never is in Boston), one can see a band\nof light across the night sky that has been known since ancient times as the\nMilky Way. Explain in a sentence or two how this band of light is related to\nthe shape of the galaxy in which we live, which is also called the Milky Way.\nc) The statement that the distant galaxies are on average receding from us with\na speed proportional to their distance was first published by Edwin Hubble in\n1929, and has become known as Hubble's law. Was Hubble's original paper\nbased on the study of 2, 18, 180, or 1,800 galaxies?\nd) The following diagram, labeled Homogeneity and the Hubble Law, was used by\nWeinberg to explain how Hubble's law is consistent with the homogeneity of\nthe universe:\nThe arrows and labels from the \"Velocities seen by B\" and the \"Velocities seen\nby C\" rows have been deleted from this copy of the figure, and it is your job\nto sketch the figure in your exam book with these arrows and labels included.\n(Actually, in Weinberg's diagram these arrows were not labeled, but the labels\nare required here so that the grader does not have to judge the precise length\nof hand-drawn arrows.)\ne) The horizon is the present distance of the most distant objects from which\nlight has had time to reach us since the beginning of the universe. The horizon\nchanges with time, but of course so does the size of the universe as a whole.\nDuring a time interval in which the linear size of the universe grows by 1%,\ndoes the horizon distance\n(i) grow by more than 1%, or\n\n8.286 QUIZ 1 REVIEW PROBLEMS, FALL 2013\np. 5\n(ii) grow by less than 1%, or\n(iii) grow by the same 1%?\nf) Name the two men who in 1964 discovered the cosmic background radiation.\nWith what institution were they affiliated?\ng) At a temperature of 3000 K, the nuclei and electrons that filled the universe\ncombined to form neutral atoms, which interact very weakly with the photons\nof the background radiation.

As the name suggests, this theory is based on the hypothesis that\nthe large-scale properties of the universe do not change with time. The expansion\nof the universe was an established fact when the steady-state theory was invented,\nbut the steady-state theory reconciles the expansion with a steady-state density of\nmatter by proposing that new matter is created as the universe expands, so that\nthe matter density does not fall. Like the conventional theory, the steady-state the-\nory describes a homogeneous, isotropic, expanding universe, so the same comoving\ncoordinate formulation can be used.\na) (10 points) The steady-state theory proposes that the Hubble constant, like\nother cosmological parameters, does not change with time, so H(t) = H0.

As in the previous\nsolution, the relay station simply rebroadcasts the signal it receives from the\nsource, at exactly the instant that it receives it. The relay station therefore\nhas no effect on the signal received by the observer, but allows us to divide the\nproblem into two simple parts.\nThe distance between the jet and the relay station is very short compared to\ncosmological scales, so the effect of the expansion of the universe is negligible.\nFor this part of the problem we can use special relativity, which says that the\nperiod with which the relay station measures the received radiation is given by\nv\nsta\ns\n∆trelay\ntion =\n-c\n1 + v\nc\n× ∆tsource .\nNote that I have used the formula from the front of the exam, but I have\nchanged the size of v, since the source in this case is moving toward the relay\nstation, so the light is blue-shifted.

From a modern perspective the\nmodel is thought to be expanding.\n[It seems strange that physicists in 1917 could not correctly determine if\nthe theory described a universe that was static or expanding, but the math-\nematical formalism of general relativity can be rather confusing. The basic\nproblem is that when space is not Euclidean there is no simple way to assign\ncoordinates to it. The mathematics of general relativity is designed to be valid\nfor any coordinate system, but the underlying physics can sometimes be ob-\nscured by a peculiar choice of coordinates. A change of coordinates can not\nonly distort the apparent geometry of space, but it can also mix up space and\ntime. The de Sitter model was first written down in coordinates that made it\nlook static, so everyone believed it was.

As far as I know the word was first used in\nthis context by P.J.E.

When the matter was ionized, the free electrons inter-\nacted strongly with the photons, so the pressure of these photons prevented the\nmatter from clumping. After recombination, however, the matter became very\ntransparent to radiation, and the pressure of the radiation became ineffective.]\n[Incidentally, at roughly the same time as recombination (with big uncer-\ntainties), the mass density of the universe changed from being dominated by\n\n8.286 QUIZ 1 REVIEW PROBLEM SOLUTIONS, FALL 2011\np. 42\nradiation (photons and neutrinos) to being dominated by nonrelativistic mat-\nter. There is no known underlying connection between these two events, and it\nseems to be something of a coincidence that they occurred at about the same\ntime.\nThe transition from radiation-domination to matter-domination also\nhelped to promote the clumping of matter, but the effect was much weaker\nthan the effect of recombination-- because of the very high velocity of photons\nand neutrinos, their pressure remained a significant force even after their mass\ndensity became much smaller than that of matter.]\nPROBLEM 11: ANOTHER FLAT UNIVERSE WITH a(t) ∝t3/5\na) According to Eq.

(25 points)\n(a) (4 points) What was the first external galaxy that was shown to be at a distance\nsignificantly greater than the most distant known objects in our galaxy? How\nwas the distance estimated?\nAns: (Weinberg, page 20) The first galaxy shown to be at a distance beyond the\nsize of our galaxy was Andromeda, also known by its Messier number, M31.\nIt is the nearest spiral galaxy to our galaxy.\nThe distance was determined\n(by Hubble) using Cepheid variable stars, for which the absolute luminosity is\nproportional to the period. A measurement of a particular Cepheid's period\ndetermines the star's absolute luminosity, which, compared to the measured\nluminosity, determines the distance to the star. (Hubble's initial measurement\nof the distance to Andromeda used a badly-calibrated version of this period-\nluminosity relationship and consequently underestimated the distance by more\nthan a factor of two; nonetheless, the initial measurement still showed that\nthe Andromeda Nebula was an order of magnitude more distant than the most\ndistant known objects in our own galaxy.)\n(b) (5 points) What is recombination? Did galaxies begin to form before or after\nrecombination? Why?\nAns: (Weinberg, pages 64 and 73) Recombination refers to the formation of\nneutral atoms out of charged nuclei and electrons.\nGalaxies began to form\nafter recombination. Prior to recombination, the strong electromagnetic inter-\nactions between photons and matter produced a high pressure which effectively\ncounteracted the gravitational attraction between particles. Once the universe\nbecame transparent to radiation, the matter no longer interacted significantly\nwith the photons and consequently began to undergo gravitational collapse into\nlarge clumps.\n(c) (4 points) In Chapter IV of his book, Weinberg develops a \"recipe for a hot\nuniverse,\" in which the matter of the universe is described as a gas in thermal\nequilbrium at a very high temperature, in the vicinity of 109 K (several thou-\nsand million degrees Kelvin). Such a thermal equilibrium gas is completely\ndescribed by specifying its temperature and the density of the conserved quan-\ntities. Which of the following is on this list of conserved quantities? Circle as\nmany as apply.\n(i) baryon number\n(ii) energy per particle\n(iii) proton number\n(iv) electric charge\n(v) pressure\nAns: (Weinberg, page 91) The correct answers are (i) and (iv). A third con-\nserved quantity, lepton number, was not included in the multiple-choice options.\n(d) (4 points) The wavelength corresponding to the mean energy of a CMB (cosmic\nmicrowave background) photon today is approximately equal to which of the\n\n8.286 QUIZ 1 REVIEW PROBLEM SOLUTIONS, FALL 2011\np. 51\nfollowing quantities? (You may wish to look up the values of various physical\nconstants at the end of the quiz.)\n(i) 2 fm (2 × 10-15 m)\n(ii) 2 microns (2 × 10-6 m)\n(iii) 2 mm (2 × 10-3 m)\n(iv) 2 m.\nAns: (Ryden, page 23) The correct answer is (iii).\nIf you did not remember this number, you could estimate the answer by remem-\nbering that the characteristic temperature of the cosmic microwave background\nis approximately 3 Kelvin. The typical photon energy is then on the order of\nkT, from which we can find the frequency as E = hν. The wavelength of the\nphoton is then λ = ν/c. This approximation gives λ = 5.3 mm, which is not\nequal to the correct answer, but it is much closer to the correct answer than to\nany of the other choices.\n(e) (4 points) What is the equivalence principle?\nAns: (Ryden, page 27) In its simplest form, the equivalence principle says that\nthe gravitational mass of an object is identical to its inertial mass. This equality\nimplies the equivalent statement that it is impossible to distinguish (without\nadditional information) between an observer in a reference frame accelerating\nwith acceleration a and an observer in an inertial reference frame subject to a\ngravitational force -mobsa.\n(Actually, what the equivalence principle really says is that the ratio of the\ngravitational to inertial masses mg/mi is universal, that is, independent of the\nmaterial properties of the object in question. The ratio does not necessarily\nneed to be 1. However, once we know that the two types of masses are pro-\nportional, we can simply define the gravitational coupling G to make them\nequal. To see this, consider a theory of gravity where mg/mi = q. Then the\ngravitational force law is\nGMm\nmia = -\ng ,\nr2\nor\nGqM\na = -\n.\nr2\nAt this point, if we define G′ = Gq, we have a gravitational theory with gravi-\ntational coupling G′ and inertial mass equal to gravitational mass.)\n(f) (4 points) Why is it difficult for Earth-based experiments to look at the small\nwavelength portion of the graph of CMB energy density per wavelength vs.\nwavelength?\n\n8.286 QUIZ 1 REVIEW PROBLEM SOLUTIONS, FALL 2011\np. 52\nAns: (Weinberg, page 67) The Earth's atmosphere is increasingly opaque for\nwavelength shorter than .3 cm. Therefore, radiation at these wavelengths will\nbe absorbed and rescattered by the Earth's atmosphere; observations of the\ncosmic microwave background at small wavelengths must be performed above\nthe Earth's atmosphere.\nPROBLEM\n17:\nTRACING\nA\nLIGHT\nPULSE\nTHROUGH\nA\nRADIATION-DOMINATED UNIVERSE\n(a) The physical horizon distance is given in general by\ntf\nc\nlp,horizon = a(t)\nZ\ndt ,\na(t)\nso in this case\nlp,horizon = bt1/2\nZ tf\nc\ndt =\n2ctf .\nbt1/2\n(b) If the source is at the horizon distance, it means that a photon leaving the\nsource at t = 0 would just be reaching the origin at tf.

Hence successive wavecrests will travel\nthe same distance, as long as c∆t ≪a.

The\ntime between wavecrests, measured in coordinate time t, is therefore larger by\na factor of γ than ∆ts, the time as measured by the clock on the source:\n∆t = γ ∆ts .\nSince the radio signal is emitted when the Xanthu is at its minimum separa-\ntion from the Emmerac, the rate of change of the separation is zero, so each\nwavecrest travels the same distance (again assuming that c∆t\na). Since the\nEmmerac is at rest, its clocks run at the same speed as the co\n≪\nordinate time t,\nand hence the time interval between crests, as measured by the receiver, is\n∆tr = ∆t = γ ∆ts .\nThus the time interval as measured by the receiver is longer than that measured\nby the source, and hence it is a redshift. The redshift parameter z is given by\n∆t\n1 + z =\nr = γ ,\n∆ts\nso\nz = γ -1 .\n(c) The events described in (a) can be made to look a lot like the events described\nin (b) by transforming to a frame of reference that is moving to the right at\nspeed v0 -- i.e., by transforming to the rest frame of the Emmerac. In this\nframe the Emmerac is of course at rest, and the Xanthu is traveling on the\ntrajectory\n(x= -v0t, y=a, z=0) ,\nas in part (b). However, just as the transformation causes the x-component\nof the velocity of the Xanthu to change from zero to a negative value, so the\nx-component of the velocity of the radio signal will be transformed from zero to\na negative value. Thus in this frame the radio signal will not be traveling along\nthe y-axis, so the events will not match those described in (b). The situations\ndescribed in (a) and (b) are therefore physically distinct (which they must be\nif the redshifts are different, as we calculated above).\n\n8.286 QUIZ 1 REVIEW PROBLEM SOLUTIONS, FALL 2011\np. 55\nPROBLEM 19: A TWO-LEVEL HIGH-SPEED MERRY-GO-ROUND\n(15 points)\n(a) Since the relative positions of all the cars remain fixed as the merry-go-round\nrotates, each successive pulse from any given car to any other car takes the\nsame amount of time to complete its trip. Thus there will be no Doppler shift\ncaused by pulses taking different amounts of time; the only Doppler shift will\ncome from time dilation.\nWe will describe the events from the point of view of an inertial reference\nframe at rest relative to the hub of the merry-go-round, which we will call the\nlaboratory frame. This is the frame in which the problem is described, in which\nthe inner cars are moving at speed v, and the outer cars are moving at speed\n2v. In the laboratory frame, the time interval between the wave crests emitted\nby the source ∆tLab\nS\nwill be exactly equal to the time interval ∆tLab\nO\nbetween\ntwo crests reaching the observer:\n∆tLab\nO\n= ∆tLab\nS\n.\nThe clocks on the merry-go-round cars are moving relative to the laboratory\nframe, so they will appear to be running slowly by the factor\nγ1 = p\n1 -v2/c2\nfor the inner cars, and by the factor\nγ2 =\n1 -4v2/c2\nfor the outer cars.\nThus, if we let\np\n∆tS denote the time between crests as\nmeasured by a clock on the source, and ∆tO as the time between crests asFour evenly spaced cars which travel around a central hub.\nu\nR\nR\n2υ\nυ\nυ\nυ\n2υ\n2υ\nHub\nυ\nυ\nImage by MIT OpenCourseWare.\n\n8.286 QUIZ 1 REVIEW PROBLEM SOLUTIONS, FALL 2011\np. 56\nmeasured by a clock moving with the observer, then these quantities are related\nto the laboratory frame times by\nγ ∆t\nLa\nS = ∆t\nb\nS\nand γ\nLab\n1∆tO = ∆tO\n.\nTo make sure that the γ-factors are on the right side of the equation, you\nshould keep in mind that any time interval should be measured as shorter on\nthe moving clocks than on the lab clocks, since these clocks appear to run\nslowly.

It is the standard situation of a source and observer moving directly away\nfrom each other, as discussed at the end of Lecture Notes 1. The Doppler shift\nis given by Eq.

Writing the\nformula for a recession speed u, it becomes\n(1 + z)|relay =\ns\n1 + u\nc\nu .\n1 -c\nIf we again use the symbol ∆tS for the time between wave crests as measured\nby a clock on the source, then the time between the receipt of wave crests as\nmeasured by the relay station is\nu\n∆t\n=\ns\n1 + c\nR\n1 -u ∆tS .\nc\nThe second part of the discussion concerns the transmission from the relay\nstation to car 6. The velocity of car 6 is perpendicular to the direction from\nwhich the pulse is being received, so this is a transverse Doppler shift. Any\nchange in path length between successive pulses is second order in ∆t, so it can\nbe ignored. The only effect is therefore the time dilation. As described in the\nlaboratory frame, the time separation between crests reaching the observer is\nthe same as the time separation measured by the relay station:\n∆tLab\nO\n= ∆tR .\nAs in part (a), the time dilation implies that\nγ\nLab\n2∆tO = ∆tO\n.\nCombining the formulas above,\n+\n∆O\nγ2\ns\nu\n=\nc\n1 -u ∆tS .\nc\nAgain ∆tO ≡(1 + z) ∆tS, so\ns\n1 + u\ns1 -4v2 1 + u\n=\n-\nz\nc\nc\nγ2\n1 -u\n1 =\nc\nc\n1 -u\nc\n\n-1 .\n\n8.286 QUIZ 1 REVIEW PROBLEM SOLUTIONS, FALL 2011\np. 58\nPROBLEM 20:\nSIGNAL PROPAGATION IN A FLAT MATTER-\nDOMINATED UNIVERSE (55 points)\n(a)-(i) If we let lc(t) denote the coordinate distance of the light signal from A, then\nwe can make use of Eq.

He found that its spiral arms included a few bright\nvariable stars, with the same sort of periodic variation of luminosity as was\nalready familiar for a class of stars in our galaxy known as Cepheid variables.\nThe reason this was so important was that in the preceding decade the work of\nHenrietta Swan Leavitt and Harlow Shapley of the Harvard College Observa-\ntory had provided a tight relation between the observed periods of variation of\nthe Cepheids and their absolute luminosities. (Absolute luminosity is the total\nradiant power emitted by an astronomical object in all directions. Apparent\nluminosity is the radiant power received by us in each square centimeter of our\ntelescope mirror. It is the apparent rather than the absolute luminosity that de-\ntermines the subjective degree of brightness of astronomical objects. Of course,\nthe apparent luminosity depends not only on the absolute luminosity, but also\non the distance; thus, knowing both the absolute and the apparent luminosities\nof an astronomical body, we can infer its distance.) Hubble, observing the ap-\nparent luminosity of the Cepheids in the Andromeda Nebula, and estimating\ntheir absolute luminosity from their periods, could immediately calculate their\ndistance, and hence the distance of the Andromeda Nebula, using the simple\nrule that apparent luminosity is proportional to the absolute luminosity and\ninversely proportional to the square of the distance.\nHe also used particularly bright stars as standard candles, as we deduce from\npage 25:\nReturning now to 1929: Hubble estimated the distance to 18 galaxies from\nthe apparent luminosity of their brighest stars, and compared these distances\nwith the galaxies' respective velocities, determined spectroscopically from their\nDoppler shifts.\n\n8.286 QUIZ 1 REVIEW PROBLEM SOLUTIONS, FALL 2011\np. 65\nNote: since from reading just the first part of Weinberg's discussion one could\nbe induced to think that Hubble used just Cepheids as standard candles, stu-\ndents who mentioned only Cepheids got 9 points out of 10. In fact, however,\nHubble was able to identify Cepheid variables in only a few galaxies.\nThe\nCepheids were crucial, because they served as a calibration for the larger dis-\ntances, but they were not in themselves sufficient.\n(b) (5 points) Quoting Weinberg's The First Three Minutes, chapter 2, page 21:\nWe would expect intuitively that at any given time the universe ought to look\nthe same to observers in all typical galaxies, and in whatever directions they\nlook. (Here, and below, I will use the label \"typical\" to indicate galaxies that do\nnot have any large peculiar motion of their own, but are simply carried along\nwith the general cosmic flow of galaxies.)\nThis hypothesis is so natural (at\nleast since Copernicus) that it has been called the Cosmological Principle by\nthe English astrophysicist Edward Arthur Milne.\nSo the Cosmological principle basically states that the universe appears as ho-\nmogeneous and isotropic (on scales of distance large enough) to any typical ob-\nserver, where typical is referred to observers with small local motion compared\nto the expansion flow. Ryden gives a more general definition of Cosmological\nPrinciple, which is valid as well. Quoting Ryden's Introduction to Cosmology,\nchapter 2, page 11 or 14 (depending on which version):\nHowever, modern cosmologists have adopted the cosmological principle,\nwhich states: There is nothing special about our location in the universe. The\ncosmological principle holds true only on large scales (of 100 Mpc or more).\n(c) (10 points) Quoting again Ryden's Introduction to Cosmology, chapter 2, page\n9 or 11:\nSaying that the universe is isotropic means that there are no preferred direc-\ntions in the universe; it looks the same no matter which way you point your\ntelescope. Saying that the universe is homogeneous means that there are no\npreferred locations in the universe; it looks the same no matter where you set\nup your telescope.\n(i)\nFalse. If the universe is isotropic around one point it does not need to be\nhomogeneous. A counter-example is a distribution of matter with spherical\nsymmetry, that is, with a density which is only a function of the radius\nbut does not depend on the direction: ρ(r, θ, φ) ≡ρ(r). In this case for an\nobserver at the center of the distribution the universe looks isotropic but\nit is not homogeneous.\n(ii)\nTrue. For the case of Euclidean geometry isotropy around two or more\ndistinct points does imply homogeneity. Weinberg shows this in chapter\n2, page 24. Consider two observers, and two arbitrary points A and B\n\n8.286 QUIZ 1 REVIEW PROBLEM SOLUTIONS, FALL 2011\np. 66\nwhich we would like to prove equivalent. Consider a circle through point\nA, centered on observer 1, and another circle through point B, centered\non observer 2. If C is a point on the intersection of the two circles, then\nisotropy about the two observers implies that A = C and B = C, and\nhence A = B. (This argument was good enough for Weinberg and hence\ngood enough to deserve full credit, but it is actually incomplete: one can\nfind points A and B for which the two circles will not intersect. On your\nnext problem set you will have a chance to invent a better proof.)\n(d) (2 points extra credit) False. If we relax the hypothesis of Euclidean geome-\ntry, then isotropy around two points does not necessarily imply homogeneity.\nA counter-example we mentioned in class is a two-dimensional universe con-\nsisting of the surface of a sphere.\nThink of the sphere in three Euclidean\ndimensions, but the model \"universe\" consists only of its two-dimensional sur-\nface. Imagine latitude and longitude lines to give coordinates to the surface,\nand imagine a matter distribution that depends only on latitude. This would\nnot be homogeneous, but it would look isotropic to observers at both the north\nand south poles.\nWhile this example describes a two-dimensional universe,\nwhich therefore cannot be our universe, we will learn shortly how to construct\na three-dimensional non-Euclidean universe with these same properties.\n+Solution written by Daniele Bertolini.\nPROBLEM 22: THE TRAJECTORY OF A PHOTON ORIGINATING\nAT THE HORIZON (25 points)\n(a) They key idea is that the coordinate speed of light is given by\ndx\nc\n=\n,\ndt\na(t)\nso the coordinate distance (in notches) that light can travel between t = 0 and\nnow (t = t0) is given by\nlc =\nZ t0 c dt .\na(t)\nThe corresponding physical distance is the horizon distance:\nt0 c dt\nlp,horizon(t0) = a(t0)\nZ\n.\na(t)\nEvaluating,\nt0\nlp,horizon(t0) =\n2/3\nc dt\n2/3\n1/3\nbt0\nZ\n= t\n.\nbt\n3ct\n2/3\nh\ni\n=\n3ct0\n\n8.286 QUIZ 1 REVIEW PROBLEM SOLUTIONS, FALL 2011\np. 67\n(b) As stated in part (a), the coordinate distance that light can travel between\nt = 0 and t = t0 is given by\nZ t0\nc d\n/3\nt\nct\nl=\n=\nc\n.\na(t)\nb\nThus, if we are at the origin, at t = 0 the photon must have been at\n1/3\nct\nx\n0 =\n.\nb\n(c) The photon starts at x = x0 at t = 0, and then travels in the negative x-\ndirection at speed c/a(t).

(25 points)\n(a) (5 points)\nThe diagram was used to explain how Hubble's Law is consistent with homo-\ngeneity. Naively Hubble's law sounds like it makes us the center of the universe,\nsince all distant galaxies are receding from us. The diagram shows, however,\nthat if observers on Galaxy A see a Hubble expansion pattern, as shown on the\ntop line, then observers on Galaxies B and C would also see a Hubble expansion\npattern, centered on themselves.\n(b) (5 points) The intensity at short\nwavelengths is suppressed by the ef-\nfect of quantum theory, which im-\nplies that the electomagnetic field\nis composed of quanta, or photons,\neach with an energy of Planck's con-\nstant h times the frequency ν = c/λ,\nwhere λ is the wavelength.\nWhen\nthe wavelength is so small that the\nphoton energy is large compared to\nkT, the typical thermal energy, then\nit is rare for these high-energy pho-\ntons to exist.\n(c) (5 points) By observing multiple\nclosely spaced absorption lines of the\ncyanogen radicals, astronomers can\ninfer the relative population of the\nground state and an excited state.\n\n8.286 QUIZ 1 SOLUTIONS, FALL 2013\np. 2\nThis allows astronomers to measure the effective temperature of interstellar gas\nclouds that are in equilibrium with the CMB.\n(d) (5 points) Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson discovered the cosmic microwave\nbackground (3 points), while employed at Bell Telephone Laboratories (2\npoints).\n(e) (5 points) Ryden used the teddy-\nbear diagram at the right to il-\nlustrate the equivalence principle,\na key assumption of general rela-\ntivity.

      "content": "MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY\nPhysics Department\nPhysics 8.286: The Early Universe\nNovember 2, 2013\nProf. Alan Guth\nREVIEW PROBLEMS FOR QUIZ 2\nQUIZ DATE: Thursday, November 7, 2013, during the normal class time.\nCOVERAGE: Lecture Notes 4 and 5, and pp. 1-10 of Lecture Notes 6; Prob-\nlem Sets 4, 5, and 6; Weinberg, The First Three Minutes, Chapters 4 - 7; In\nRyden's Introduction to Cosmology, we have read Chapters 4, 5, and Sec. 6.1\nduring this period. These chapters, however, parallel what we have done or\nwill be doing in lecture, so you should take them as an aid to learning the lec-\nture material; there will be no questions on this quiz explicitly based on these\nsections from Ryden. But we have also read Chapters 10 (Nucleosynthesis and\nthe Early Universe) and 8 (Dark Matter) in Ryden, and these will be included\non the quiz, except for Sec. 10.3 (Deuterium Synthesis). We will return to deu-\nterium synthesis later in the course. Ryden's Eqs. (10.11) and (10.12) involve\nsimilar issues from statistical mechanics, so you should not worry if you do not\nunderstand these equations. (In fact, you should worry if you do understand\nthem; as we will discuss later, they are spectacularly incorrect.) Eq. (10.13),\nwhich is obtained by dividing Eq. (10.11) by Eq. (10.12), is nonetheless correct;\nfor this course you need not worry how to derive this formula, but you should\nassume it and understand its consequences, as described by Ryden and also\nby Weinberg. Chapters 4 and 5 of Weinberg's book are packed with numbers;\nyou need not memorize these numbers, but you should be familiar with their\norders of magnitude. We will not take offfor the spelling of names, as long\nas they are vaguely recognizable. For dates before 1900, it will be sufficient\nfor you to know when things happened to within 100 years. For dates after\n1900, it will be sufficient if you can place events within 10 years. You should\nexpect one problem based on the readings, and several calculational problems.\nOne of the problems on the quiz will be taken verbatim (or at least\nalmost verbatim) from either the homework assignments, or from\nthe starred problems from this set of Review Problems. The starred\nproblems are the ones that I recommend that you review most carefully: Prob-\nlems 4, 5, 6, 11, 13, 15, 17, and 19. There are only three reading questions,\nProblems 1, 2, and 3.\nPURPOSE: These review problems are not to be handed in, but are being made\navailable to help you study. They come mainly from quizzes in previous years.\n\n8.286 QUIZ 2 REVIEW PROBLEMS, FALL 2013\np. 2\nIn some cases the number of points assigned to the problem on the quiz is listed\n-- in all such cases it is based on 100 points for the full quiz.\nINFORMATION TO BE GIVEN ON QUIZ:\nEach quiz in this course will have a section of \"useful information\" for your\nreference.

However, this abun-\ndance is hard to measure accurately. Which of the following is NOT a reason\nwhy this is hard to do?\n(i) The neutron in a deuterium nucleus decays on the time scale of 15 minutes,\nso almost none of the primordial deuterium produced in the Big Bang is\nstill present.\n(ii) The deuterium abundance in the Earth's oceans is biased because, being\nheavier, less deuterium than hydrogen would have escaped from the Earth's\nsurface.\n(iii) The deuterium abundance in the Sun is biased because nuclear reactions\ntend to destroy it by converting it into helium-3.\n(iv) The spectral lines of deuterium are almost identical with those of hydrogen,\nso deuterium signatures tend to get washed out in spectra of primordial\ngas clouds.\n(v) The deuterium abundance is so small (a few parts per million) that it\ncan be easily changed by astrophysical processes other than primordial\nnucleosynthesis.\n(c) (5 points) Give three examples of hadrons.\n(d) (6 points) In Chapter 6 of The First Three Minutes, Steven Weinberg posed the\nquestion, \"Why was there no systematic search for this [cosmic background]\nradiation, years before 1965?\" In discussing this issue, he contrasted it with\nthe history of two different elementary particles, each of which were predicted\napproximately 20 years before they were first detected.\nName one of these\ntwo elementary particles. (If you name them both correctly, you will get 3\npoints extra credit. However, one right and one wrong will get you 4 points for\nthe question, compared to 6 points for just naming one particle and getting it\nright.)\nAnswer:\n2nd Answer (optional):\n\n8.286 QUIZ 2 REVIEW PROBLEMS, FALL 2013\np. 7\n(e) (6 points) In Chapter 6 of The First Three Minutes, Steven Weinberg discusses\nthree reasons why the importance of a search for a 3*K microwave radiation\nbackground was not generally appreciated in the 1950s and early 1960s. Choose\nthose three reasons from the following list. (2 points for each right answer, circle\nat most 3.)\n(i) The earliest calculations erroneously predicted a cosmic background tem-\nperature of only about 0.1*K, and such a background would be too weak\nto detect.\n(ii) There was a breakdown in communication between theorists and experi-\nmentalists.\n(iii) It was not technologically possible to detect a signal as weak as a 3*K\nmicrowave background until about 1965.\n(iv) Since almost all physicists at the time were persuaded by the steady state\nmodel, the predictions of the big bang model were not taken seriously.\n(v) It was extraordinarily difficult for physicists to take seriously any theory\nof the early universe.\n(vi) The early work on nucleosynthesis by Gamow, Alpher, Herman, and Follin,\net al., had attempted to explain the origin of all complex nuclei by reactions\nin the early universe.\nThis program was never very successful, and its\ncredibility was further undermined as improvements were made in the\nalternative theory, that elements are synthesized in stars.\nPROBLEM 2: DID YOU DO THE READING? (24 points)\nThe following problem was Problem 1 of Quiz 2 in 2007.\n(a) (6 points) In 1948 Ralph A. Alpher and Robert Herman wrote a paper predict-\ning a cosmic microwave background with a temperature of 5 K. The paper was\nbased on a cosmological model that they had developed with George Gamow,\nin which the early universe was assumed to have been filled with hot neutrons.\nAs the universe expanded and cooled the neutrons underwent beta decay into\nprotons, electrons, and antineutrinos, until at some point the universe cooled\nenough for light elements to be synthesized. Alpher and Herman found that to\naccount for the observed present abundances of light elements, the ratio of pho-\ntons to nuclear particles must have been about 109. Although the predicted\ntemperature was very close to the actual value of 2.7 K, the theory differed\nfrom our present theory in two ways. Circle the two correct statements in the\nfollowing list. (3 points for each right answer; circle at most 2.)\n(i) Gamow, Alpher, and Herman assumed that the neutron could decay, but\nnow the neutron is thought to be absolutely stable.\n\n8.286 QUIZ 2 REVIEW PROBLEMS, FALL 2013\np. 8\n(ii) In the current theory, the universe started with nearly equal densities of\nprotons and neutrons, not all neutrons as Gamow, Alpher, and Herman\nassumed.\n(iii) In the current theory, the universe started with mainly alpha particles, not\nall neutrons as Gamow, Alpher, and Herman assumed. (Note: an alpha\nparticle is the nucleus of a helium atom, composed of two protons and two\nneutrons.)\n(iv) In the current theory, the conversion of neutrons into protons (and vice\nversa) took place mainly through collisions with electrons, positrons, neu-\ntrinos, and antineutrinos, not through the decay of the neutrons.\n(v) The ratio of photons to nuclear particles in the early universe is now be-\nlieved to have been about 103, not 109 as Alpher and Herman concluded.\n(b) (6 points) In Weinberg's \"Recipe for a Hot Universe,\" he described the primor-\ndial composition of the universe in terms of three conserved quantities: electric\ncharge, baryon number, and lepton number. If electric charge is measured in\nunits of the electron charge, then all three quantities are integers for which\nthe number density can be compared with the number density of photons. For\neach quantity, which choice most accurately describes the initial ratio of the\nnumber density of this quantity to the number density of photons:\nElectric Charge:\n(i) ∼109\n(ii)\n(iii)\n(iv) ∼10-6\n∼\n∼\n(v) either zero or negligible\nBaryon Number:\n(i) ∼10-20\n(ii) ∼10-9\n(iii) ∼10-6\n(iv) ∼1\n(v) anywhere from 10-5 to 1\nLepton Number:\n(i) ∼109\n(ii) ∼1000\n(iii) ∼1\n(iv) ∼10-6\n(v) could be as high as ∼1, but\nis assumed to be very small\n\n8.286 QUIZ 2 REVIEW PROBLEMS, FALL 2013\np. 9\n(c) (12 points) The figure below comes from Weinberg's Chapter 5, and is labeled\nThe Shifting Neutron-Proton Balance.\n(i) (3 points) During the period labeled \"thermal equilibrium,\" the neutron\nfraction is changing because (choose one):\n(A) The neutron is unstable, and decays into a proton, electron, and an-\ntineutrino with a lifetime of about 1 second.\n(B) The neutron is unstable, and decays into a proton, electron, and an-\ntineutrino with a lifetime of about 15 seconds.\n(C) The neutron is unstable, and decays into a proton, electron, and an-\ntineutrino with a lifetime of about 15 minutes.\n(D) Neutrons and protons can be converted from one into through reac-\ntions such as\nantineutrino + proton ←→electron + neutron\nneutrino + neutron ←→positron + proton.\n(E) Neutrons and protons can be converted from one into the other\nthrough reactions such as\nantineutrino + proton ←→positron + neutron\nneutrino + neutron ←→electron + proton.\n(F) Neutrons and protons can be created and destroyed by reactions such\nas\nproton + neutrino ←→positron + antineutrino\nneutron + antineutrino ←→electron + positron.\n\n8.286 QUIZ 2 REVIEW PROBLEMS, FALL 2013\np. 10\n(ii) (3 points) During the period labeled \"neutron decay,\" the neutron fraction\nis changing because (choose one):\n(A) The neutron is unstable, and decays into a proton, electron, and an-\ntineutrino with a lifetime of about 1 second.\n(B) The neutron is unstable, and decays into a proton, electron, and an-\ntineutrino with a lifetime of about 15 seconds.\n(C) The neutron is unstable, and decays into a proton, electron, and an-\ntineutrino with a lifetime of about 15 minutes.\n(D) Neutrons and protons can be converted from one into the other\nthrough reactions such as\nantineutrino + proton ←→electron + neutron\nneutrino + neutron ←→positron + proton.\n(E) Neutrons and protons can be converted from one into the other\nthrough reactions such as\nantineutrino + proton ←→positron + neutron\nneutrino + neutron ←→electron + proton.\n(F) Neutrons and protons can be created and destroyed by reactions such\nas\nproton + neutrino ←→positron + antineutrino\nneutron + antineutrino ←→electron + positron.\n(iii) (3 points) The masses of the neutron and proton are not exactly equal,\nbut instead\n(A) The neutron is more massive than a proton with a rest energy differ-\nence of 1.293 GeV (1 GeV = 109 eV).\n(B) The neutron is more massive than a proton with a rest energy differ-\nence of 1.293 MeV (1 MeV = 106 eV).\n(C) The neutron is more massive than a proton with a rest energy differ-\nence of 1.293 KeV (1 KeV = 103 eV).\n(D) The proton is more massive than a neutron with a rest energy differ-\nence of 1.293 GeV.\n(E) The proton is more massive than a neutron with a rest energy differ-\nence of 1.293 MeV.\n(F) The proton is more massive than a neutron with a rest energy differ-\nence of 1.293 KeV.\n\n8.286 QUIZ 2 REVIEW PROBLEMS, FALL 2013\np. 11\n(iv) (3 points) During the period labeled \"era of nucleosynthesis,\" (choose one:)\n(A) Essentially all the neutrons present combine with protons to form\nhelium nuclei, which mostly survive until the present time.\n(B) Essentially all the neutrons present combine with protons to form\ndeuterium nuclei, which mostly survive until the present time.\n(C) About half the neutrons present combine with protons to form helium\nnuclei, which mostly survive until the present time, and the other half\nof the neutrons remain free.\n(D) About half the neutrons present combine with protons to form deu-\nterium nuclei, which mostly survive until the present time, and the\nother half of the neutrons remain free.\n(E) Essentially all the protons present combine with neutrons to form\nhelium nuclei, which mostly survive until the present time.\n(F) Essentially all the protons present combine with neutrons to form\ndeuterium nuclei, which mostly survive until the present time.\nPROBLEM 3: DID YOU DO THE READING? (20 points)\nThe following problem comes from Quiz 2, 2011.\n(a) (8 points) During nucleosynthesis, heavier nuclei form from protons and neu-\ntrons through a series of two particle reactions.\n(i) In The First Three Minutes, Weinberg discusses two chains of reactions\nthat, starting from protons and neutrons, end up with helium, He4. De-\nscribe at least one of these two chains.\n(ii) Explain briefly what is the deuterium bottleneck, and what is its role during\nnucleosynthesis.\n(b) (12 points) In Chapter 4 of The First Three Minutes, Steven Weinberg makes\nthe following statement regarding the radiation-dominated phase of the early\nuniverse:\nThe time that it takes for the universe to cool from one temperature to another\nis proportional to the difference of the inverse squares of these temperatures.\nIn this part of the problem you will explore more quantitatively this statement.\n(i) For a radiation-dominated universe the scale-factor a(t) ∝t1/2. Find the\ncosmic time t as a function of the Hubble expansion rate H.\n(ii) The mass density stored in radiation ρr is proportional to the temperature\nT to the fourth power: i.e., ρr ≃αT 4, for some constant α.

Use the Friedmann equation for a flat universe\n(k = 0) with ρ = ρr to express the Hubble expansion rate H in terms of the\ntemperature T. You will need the SI value of the gravitational constant\nG ≃6.67×10-11 N·m2·kg-2.

Alpher and Herman found that to\naccount for the observed present abundances of light elements, the ratio of pho-\ntons to nuclear particles must have been about 109. Although the predicted\ntemperature was very close to the actual value of 2.7 K, the theory differed\nfrom our present theory in two ways. Circle the two correct statements in the\nfollowing list. (3 points for each right answer; circle at most 2.)\n(i) Gamow, Alpher, and Herman assumed that the neutron could decay, but\nnow the neutron is thought to be absolutely stable.\n(ii) In the current theory, the universe started with nearly equal densities of\nprotons and neutrons, not all neutrons as Gamow, Alpher, and Herman\nassumed.\n(iii) In the current theory, the universe started with mainly alpha particles, not\nall neutrons as Gamow, Alpher, and Herman assumed. (Note: an alpha\nparticle is the nucleus of a helium atom, composed of two protons and two\nneutrons.)\n(iv) In the current theory, the conversion of neutrons into protons (and vice\nversa) took place mainly through collisions with electrons, positrons, neu-\ntrinos, and antineutrinos, not through the decay of the neutrons.\n(v) The ratio of photons to nuclear particles in the early universe is now be-\nlieved to have been about 103, not 109 as Alpher and Herman concluded.\n(b) (6 points) In Weinberg's \"Recipe for a Hot Universe,\" he described the primor-\ndial composition of the universe in terms of three conserved quantities: electric\ncharge, baryon number, and lepton number.

However,\nthe deuterium nucleus is extremely loosely bound compared to H3, He3,\nor especially He4. So, there will be a range of temperatures which are\nlow enough for H3, He3, and He4 nuclei to be bound, but too high to\nallow the deuterium nucleus to be stable. This is the temperature range\nwhere the deuterium bottleneck is in action: even if H3, He3, and He4\nnuclei could in principle be stable at those temperatures, they do not form\nbecause deuterium, which is the starting point for their formation, cannot\nbe formed yet. Nucleosynthesis cannot proceed at a significant rate until\nthe temperature is low enough so that deuterium nuclei are stable; at this\npoint the deuterium bottleneck has been passed.\n(b) (12 points)\n(i) (3 points) If we take a(t) = bt1/2, for some constant b, we get for the\nHubble expansion rate:\na\nH =\n=\n=\na\n2t\n⇒\nt =\n.\n2H\n(ii) (6 points) By using the Friedmann equation with k = 0 and ρ = ρr = αT 4,\nwe find:\nH2\n8π\n8π\n8π\n=\nGρr =\nGαT 4\n=⇒\nH = T 2\nr\nGα .\nIf we substitute the given numerical values G\n6.67\n10-11 N m2 kg-2\nand α ≃4.52 × 10-32 kg · m-3\n≃\n×\n·\n·\n· K-we get:\nH ≃T 2 × 5.03 × 10-21 s-1 · K-2 .\nNotice that the units correctly combine to give H in units of s-1 if the\ntemperature is expressed in degrees Kelvin (K).

Since dψ/dθ = 1, this means that θ must\nalso change by 2π. From a = α(1 -cos θ), one can see that a returns to zero\nat θ = 2π, so this is exactly the lifetime of the universe. So,\nTime for photon to return = 1 .\nLifetime of universe\nIf it is not clear why ψ must change by 2π for the photon to return to\nits starting point, then recall the construction of the closed universe that was\nused in Lecture Notes 5. The closed universe is described as the 3-dimensional\nsurface of a sphere in a four-dimensional Euclidean space with coordinates\n(x, y, z, w):\nx2 + y2 + z2 + w2 = a2 ,\nwhere a is the radius of the sphere. The Robertson-Walker coordinate system\nis constructed on the 3-dimensional surface of the sphere, taking the point\n(0, 0, 0, 1) as the center of the coordinate system. If we define the w-direction\nas \"north,\" then the point (0, 0, 0, 1) can be called the north pole. Each point\n(x, y, z, w) on the surface of the sphere is assigned a coordinate ψ, defined to be\nthe angle between the positive w axis and the vector (x, y, z, w). Thus ψ = 0\nat the north pole, and ψ = π for the antipodal point, (0, 0, 0, -1), which can be\ncalled the south pole. In making the round trip the photon must travel from\nthe north pole to the south pole and back, for a total range of 2π.\n\n8.286 QUIZ 2 REVIEW PROBLEM SOLUTIONS, FALL 2013\np. 38\nDiscussion: Some students answered that the photon would return in the life-\ntime of the universe, but reached this conclusion without considering the details\nof the motion. The argument was simply that, at the big crunch when the scale\nfactor returns to zero, all distances would return to zero, including the distance\nbetween the photon and its starting place. This statement is correct, but it does\nnot quite answer the question. First, the statement in no way rules out the pos-\nsibility that the photon might return to its starting point before the big crunch.\nSecond, if we use the delicate but well-motivated definitions that general rel-\nativists use, it is not necessarily true that the photon returns to its starting\npoint at the big crunch. To be concrete, let me consider a radiation-dominated\nclosed universe--a hypothetical universe for which the only \"matter\" present\nconsists of massless particles such as photons or neutrinos. In that case (you\ncan check my calculations) a photon that leaves the north pole at t = 0 just\nreaches the south pole at the big crunch. It might seem that reaching the south\npole at the big crunch is not any different from completing the round trip back\nto the north pole, since the distance between the north pole and the south pole\nis zero at t = tCrunch, the time of the big crunch. However, suppose we adopt\nthe principle that the instant of the initial singularity and the instant of the\nfinal crunch are both too singular to be considered part of the spacetime. We\nwill allow ourselves to mathematically consider times ranging from t = ε to\nt = tCrunch -ε, where ε is arbitrarily small, but we will not try to describe\nwhat happens exactly at t = 0 or t = tCrunch. Thus, we now consider a photon\nthat starts its journey at t = ε, and we follow it until t = tCrunch -ε. For the\ncase of the matter-dominated closed universe, such a photon would traverse\na fraction of the full circle that would be almost 1, and would approach 1 as\nε →0. By contrast, for the radiation-dominated closed universe, the photon\nwould traverse a fraction of the full circle that is almost 1/2, and it would\napproach 1/2 as ε →0. Thus, from this point of view the two cases look very\ndifferent. In the radiation-dominated case, one would say that the photon has\ncome only half-way back to its starting point.\nPROBLEM\n7:\nLENGTHS\nAND\nAREAS\nIN\nA\nTWO-DIMEN-\nSIONAL METRIC\na) Along the first segment dθ = 0, so ds2 = (1 + ar)2 dr2, or ds = (1 + ar) dr.\nIntegrating, the length of the first segment is found to be\nZ r0\nS1 =\n(1 + ar) dr = r0 +\nar2\n0 .\nAlong the second segment dr = 0, so ds = r(1 + br) dθ, where r = r0.

If stars contributed all, or most, of the mass in a galaxy, what would we\nexpect for the behavior of v(R) at large radii?\nAnswer: If stars contributed most of the mass, then at large radii the mass\nwould appear to be concentrated as a spherical lump at the center, and the\norbits of the stars would be \"Keplerian,\" i.e., orbits in a 1/r2 gravitational\nfield. Then F = ma implies that\nv2\n=\nv\n.\nR2 ∝R\n⇒\n∝√\nR\n(b) (5 points) What is actually found for the behavior of v(R)?\nAnswer: v(R) looks nearly flat at large radii.\n(c) (7 points) An important tool for estimating the mass in a galaxy is the steady-\nstate virial theorem. What does this theorem state?\nAnswer: For a gravitationally bound system in equilibrium,\nKinetic energy = -\n(Gravitational potential energy) .\n(The equality holds whenever I ≈0, where I is the moment of inertia.)\n(d) (7 points) At the end of Chapter 10, Ryden writes \"Thus, the very strong\nasymmetry between baryons and antibaryons today and the large number of\nphotons per baryon are both products of a tiny asymmetry between quarks\nand anitquarks in the early universe.\" Explain in one or a few sentences how\na tiny asymmetry between quarks and anitquarks in the early universe results\nin a strong asymmetry between baryons and antibaryons today.\nAnswer: When kT was large compared to 150 MeV, the excess of quarks over\nantiquarks was tiny: only about 3 extra quarks for every 109 antiquarks. But\nthere was massive quark-antiquark annihilation as kT fell below 150 MeV, so\nthat today we see the excess quarks, bound into baryons, and almost no sign\nof antiquarks.\n\n8.286 QUIZ 2 SOLUTIONS, FALL 2013\np. 2\nPROBLEM 2: TIME EVOLUTION OF A UNIVERSE WITH MYSTE-\nRIOUS STUFF (20 points)\n(a) The Friedmann equation in a flat universe is\na\na\n8πG\n=\nρ.\nSubstituting ρ = const/a5 and taking the square root of both sides gives\na = αa-5/2 ,\na\nfor some constant α.

(35 points)\n(a) (5 points) Ryden summarizes the results of the COBE satellite experiment for\nthe measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) in the form of\nthree important results. The first was that, in any particular direction of the\nsky, the spectrum of the CMB is very close to that of an ideal blackbody. The\nFIRAS instrument on the COBE satellite could have detected deviations from\nthe blackbody spectrum as small as ∆ε/ε ≈10-n, where n is an integer. To\nwithin ±1, what is n?\n(b) (5 points) The second result was the measurement of a dipole distortion of\nthe CMB spectrum; that is, the radiation is slightly blueshifted to higher tem-\nperatures in one direction, and slightly redshifted to lower temperatures in\nthe opposite direction. To what physical effect was this dipole distortion at-\ntributed?\n(c) (5 points) The third result concerned the measurement of temperature fluctu-\nations after the dipole feature mentioned above was subtracted out. Defining\nδT\nT(θ, φ)\nT\n(θ, φ)\n-⟨⟩\nT\n≡\n,\n⟨T⟩\nwhere ⟨T⟩= 2.725 K, the average value of T, they found a root mean square\nfluctuation,\nδT\nT\n21/2\n,\nequal to some number. To within an order of magnitude, what was that num-\nber?\n\n8.286 QUIZ 3, FALL 2013\np. 3\n(d) (5 points) Which of the following describes the Sachs-Wolfe effect?\n(i) Photons from fluid which had a velocity toward us along the line of sight\nappear redder because of the Doppler effect.\n(ii) Photons from fluid which had a velocity toward us along the line of sight\nappear bluer because of the Doppler effect.\n(iii) Photons from overdense regions at the surface of last scattering appear\nredder because they must climb out of the gravitational potential well.\n(iv) Photons from overdense regions at the surface of last scattering appear\nbluer because they must climb out of the gravitational potential well.\n(v) Photons traveling toward us from the surface of last scattering appear\nredder because of absorption in the intergalactic medium.\n(vi) Photons traveling toward us from the surface of last scattering appear\nbluer because of absorption in the intergalactic medium.\n(e) (5 points) The flatness problem refers to the extreme fine-tuning that is needed\nin Ωat early times, in order for it to be as close to 1 today as we observe.\nStarting with the assumption that Ωtoday is equal to 1 within about 1%, one\nconcludes that at one second after the big bang,\n|Ω-1|t=1 sec < 10-m ,\nwhere m is an integer. To within ± 3, what is m?\n(f) (5 points) The total energy density of the present universe consists mainly of\nbaryonic matter, dark matter, and dark energy. Give the percentages of each,\naccording to the best fit obtained from the Planck 2013 data. You will get full\ncredit if the first (baryonic matter) is accurate to ±2%, and the other two are\naccurate to within ±5%.\n(g) (5 points) Within the conventional hot big bang cosmology (without inflation),\nit is difficult to understand how the temperature of the CMB can be correlated\nat angular separations that are so large that the points on the surface of last\nscattering was separated from each other by more than a horizon distance. Ap-\nproximately what angle, in degrees, corresponds to a separation on the surface\nlast scattering of one horizon length? You will get full credit if your answer is\nright to within a factor of 2.\n\n8.286 QUIZ 3, FALL 2013\np. 4\nPROBLEM 2: FREEZE-OUT OF MUONS (25 points)\nThe following problem was on Problem Set 7, Problem 2 (2013).\nA particle called the muon seems to be essentially identical to the electron,\nexcept that it is heavier-- the mass/energy of a muon is 106 MeV, compared to\n0.511 MeV for the electron. The muon (μ-) has the same charge as an electron,\ndenoted by -e. There is also an antimuon (μ+), analogous to the positron, with\ncharge +e. The muon and antimuon have the same spin as the electron. There is\nno known particle with a mass between that of an electron and that of a muon.\n(a) (5 points) The formula for the energy density of black-body radiation, as given\nby Eq. (6.48) of the lecture notes,\nπ2 (kT)4\nu = g\n,\n30 ( hc)3\nis written in terms of a normalization constant g. What is the value of g for\nthe muons, taking μ+ and μ-together?\n(b) (8 points) When kT is just above 106 MeV as the universe cools, what particles\nbesides the muons are contained in the thermal radiation that fills the universe?\nWhat is the contribution to g from each of these particles?\n(c) (12 points) As kT falls below 106 MeV, the muons disappear from the thermal\nequilibrium radiation. At these temperatures all of the other particles in the\nblack-body radiation are interacting fast enough to maintain equilibrium, so\nthe heat given offfrom the muons is shared among all the other particles.\nLetting a denote the Robertson-Walker scale factor, by what factor does the\nquantity aT increase when the muons disappear?\n\n8.286 QUIZ 3, FALL 2013\np. 5\nPROBLEM 3:\nTHE EVENT HORIZON FOR OUR UNIVERSE (25\npoints)\nWe have learned that the expansion history of our universe can be described\nin terms of a small set of numbers: Ωm,0, the present contribution to Ωfrom\nnonrelativistic matter; Ωrad,0, the present contribution to Ωfrom radiation; Ωvac,\nthe present contribution to Ωfrom vacuum energy; and H0, the present value of the\nHubble expansion rate. The best estimates of these numbers are consistent with a\nflat universe, so we can take k = 0, Ωm,0 + Ωrad,0 + Ωvac = 1, and we can use the\nflat Robertson-Walker metric,\nds2 = -c2 dt2 + a2(t)\n\ndr2 + r2 dθ2 + sin2 θ dφ2\n.\n(a) (5 points) Suppose that we are at the origin\n\nof the coordina\n\nte system, and that\nat the present time t0 we emit a spherical pulse of light. It turns out that there\nis a maximum coordinate radius r = rmax that this pulse will ever reach, no\nmatter how long we wait. (The pulse will never actually reach rmax, but will\nreach all r such that 0 < r < rmax.) rmax is the coordinate of what is called\nthe event horizon: events that happen now at r ≥rmax will never be visible\nto us, assuming that we remain at the origin. Assuming for this part that the\nfunction a(t) is a known function, write an expression for rmax. Your answer\nshould be expressed as an integral, which can involve a(t), t0, and any of the\nparameters defined in the preamble. [Advice: If you cannot answer this, you\nshould still try part (c).]\n(b) (10 points) Since a(t) is not known explicitly, the answer to the previous part\nis difficult to use. Show, however, that by changing the variable of integration,\nyou can rewrite the expression for rmax as a definite integral involving only the\nparameters specified in the preamble, without any reference to the function a(t),\nexcept perhaps to its present value a(t0). You are not expected to evaluate this\nintegral. [Hint: One method is to use\na(t)\nx = a(t0)\nas the variable of integration, just as we did when we derived the first of the\nexpressions for t0 shown in the formula sheets.]\n(c) (10 points) Astronomers often describe distances in terms of redshifts, so it\nis useful to find the redshift of the event horizon. That is, if a light ray that\noriginated at r = rmax arrived at Earth today, what would be its redshift zeh\n(eh = event horizon)? You are not asked to find an explicit expression for\nzeh, but instead an equation that could be solved numerically to determine\nzeh. For this part you can treat rmax as given, so it does not matter if you\nhave done parts (a) and (b). You will get half credit for a correct answer that\ninvolves the function a(t), and full credit for a correct answer that involves only\nexplicit integrals depending only on the parameters specified in the preamble,\nand possibly a(t0).\n\n8.286 QUIZ 3, FALL 2013\np. 6\nPROBLEM 4: BEHAVIOR OF ΩIN A UNIVERSE DOMINATED BY\nMYSTERIOUS STUFF (15 points)\n(a) (5 points) In discussing the flatness problem, we learned how to calculate the\nbehavior of (Ω-1)/Ω, learning that it obeys an equation of the form\nΩ-1\nT 2\n= A\n,\n(4.1)\nΩ\nρ\nwhere A is to a good approximation independent of time. Show how Eq. (4.1)\ncan be derived from the first order Friedmann equation,\n8π\nkc2\nH2 =\nGρ -\n,\n(4.2)\na2\nand in the process you should find the expression for A. (No credit will be\ngiven for simply writing the expression for A from memory.)\n(b) (10 points) Using Eq. (4.1), we learned that (Ω\n1)/Ωgrows as t in a radiation-\ndominated universe, and as t2/3\n-\nin a matter-dominated universe.\nSuppose,\nhowever, that we consider a universe dominated by \"mysterious stuff,\" which\nhas the property that\nρ ∝\n.\n(4.3))\na5(t)\n(You may recall that on Quiz 2 we had a problem concerning a hypothetical\nuniverse dominated by this fictitious material.) How would (Ω-1)/Ωbehave in\na universe dominated by mysterious stuff? You may assume that the universe\nis very nearly flat.\n\n8.286 QUIZ 3, FALL 2013\np. 7\nProblem\nMaximum\nScore\nTOTAL\n\nMASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY\nPhysics Department\nPhysics 8.286: The Early Universe\nDecember 5, 2013\nProf. Alan Guth\nQUIZ 3 FORMULA SHEET\nSPEED OF LIGHT IN COMOVING COORDINATES:\nc\nvcoord =\n.\na(t)\nDOPPLER SHIFT (For motion along a line):\nz = v/u\n(nonrelativistic, source moving)\nv/u\nz =\n(nonrelativistic, observer moving)\n1 -v/u\nz =\n\n1 + β -1\n(special relativity, with β = v/c)\n1 -β\nCOSMOLOGICAL REDSHIFT:\nλ\n1 +\nobserved\na(tobserved)\nz ≡\n=\nλemitted\na(temitted)\nSPECIAL RELATIVITY:\nTime Dilation Factor:\nγ ≡\n,\nβ\n1 -β2\n≡v/c\nLorentz-Fitzgerald Contraction Factor:\nγ\nRelativity of Simultaneity:\nTrailing clock reads later by an amount βl0/c .\nEnergy-Momentum Four-Vector:\nμ\nE\n\np\n=\n, p\n,\np = γm0v ,\nE =\nγm0c2 =\n\n(m0c2) + |p\nc\n| c2 ,\np2 ≡|p|2\nE2\n-\n\n= |p|2\np\n-\n=\n.\n-(m0c)2\nc\n\n8.286 QUIZ 3 FORMULA SHEET, FALL 2013\np. 2\nCOSMOLOGICAL EVOLUTION:\na\nH2 =\n\n8π\nkc2\n4π\n3p\n=\nGρ -\n,\na = -\nG\nρ\na\na\n\n+\nc2\n\na ,\na3(ti)\na4(t )\nρm(t) =\nρm(ti) (matter),\nρr(\ni\nt) =\nρr(ti) (radiation).\na3(t)\na4(t)\na\np\n3H2\nρ = -3\nρ +\n,\nΩ≡ρ/ρc ,\nwhere ρc =\n.\na\nc2\n8πG\nFlat (k = 0):\na(t) ∝t2/3\n(matter-dominated) ,\na(t) ∝t1/2\n(radiation-dominated) ,\nΩ= 1 .\nEVOLUTION OF A MATTER-DOMINATED UNIVERSE:\na\nClosed (k > 0):\nct = α(θ -sin θ) ,\n√\n= α(1\nk\n-cos θ) ,\nΩ=\n> 1 ,\n1 + cos θ\n4π Gρ\nwhere α ≡3 c2\n\na\n√\n.\nk\n\na\nOpen (k < 0):\nct = α (sinh θ -θ) ,\n√\n= α (cosh θ\n1)\nκ\n-\n,\nΩ=\n< 1 ,\n1 + cosh θ\n4π Gρ\nwhere α ≡3 c2\na\n√κ\n,\nκ ≡-k > 0 .\nROBERTSON-WALKER METRIC:\ndr\nds2 = -c2 dτ 2 = -c2 dt2+a2(t)\n\n+ r2\n1 -kr2\n\ndθ2 + sin2 θ dφ2\n.\nsin ψ\nAlternatively, for k > 0, we can define r = √\n, and then\nk\nds2 = -c2 dτ 2 = -c2 dt2+ a2(t)\n\ndψ2 + sin2 ψ\n\ndθ2 + sin2 θ dφ2\n,\n\n8.286 QUIZ 3 FORMULA SHEET, FALL 2013\np. 3\nsinh ψ\nwhere a (t) = a(t)/\n√\nk.

Problem Sets 7-9 (but note that Problem 5, The Magnetic\nMonopole Problem, has been removed from Problem Set 9); Steven Weinberg,\nThe First Three Minutes, Chapter 8 and the Afterword; Barbara Ryden, Intro-\nduction to Cosmology, Chapters 9 (The Cosmic Microwave Background) and\n11 (Inflation and the Very Early Universe); Alan Guth, Inflation and the New\nEra of High-Precision Cosmology\nOne of the problems on the quiz will be taken verbatim (or at least\nalmost verbatim) from either the homework assignments, or from the\nstarred problems from this set of Review Problems. The starred prob-\nlems are the ones that I recommend that you review most carefully: Problems\n2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, and 10.\nPURPOSE: These review problems are not to be handed in, but are being made\navailable to help you study. They come mainly from quizzes in previous years.\nIn some cases the number of points assigned to the problem on the quiz is listed\n-- in all such cases it is based on 100 points for the full quiz.\nIn addition to this set of problems, you will find on the course web page the\nactual quizzes that were given in 1994, 1996, 1998, 2000, 2002, 2004, 2007,\n2009, and 2011.

(25 points)\nThe following problem was Problem 1, Quiz 3, in 2007. Each part was worth 5\npoints.\n(a) (CMB basic facts) Which one of the following statements about CMB is not\ncorrect:\n(i) After the dipole distortion of the CMB is subtracted away, the mean tem-\nperature averaging over the sky is ⟨T⟩= 2.725K.\n(ii) After the dipole distortion of the CMB is subtracted away, the root mean\n1/2\nsquare temperature fluctuation is\nD δT\nT\n2E\n= 1.1 × 10-3.\n(iii) The dipole distortion is a simple Doppler shift, caused by the net motion of\nthe observer relative to a frame of reference in which the CMB is isotropic.\n(iv) In their groundbreaking paper, Wilson and Penzias reported the measure-\nment of an excess temperature of about 3.5 K that was isotropic, unpolar-\nized, and free from seasonal variations. In a companion paper written by\nDicke, Peebles, Roll and Wilkinson, the authors interpreted the radiation\nto be a relic of an early, hot, dense, and opaque state of the universe.\n(b) (CMB experiments) The current mean energy per CMB photon, about 6 ×\n10-4 eV, is comparable to the energy of vibration or rotation for a small\nmolecule such as H2O.\nThus microwaves with wavelengths shorter than\nλ ∼3 cm are strongly absorbed by water molecules in the atmosphere. To\nmeasure the CMB at λ < 3 cm, which one of the following methods is not a\nfeasible solution to this problem?\n(i) Measure CMB from high-altitude balloons, e.g. MAXIMA.\n(ii) Measure CMB from the South Pole, e.g. DASI.\n(iii) Measure CMB from the North Pole, e.g. BOOMERANG.\n(iv) Measure CMB from a satellite above the atmosphere of the Earth, e.g.\nCOBE, WMAP and PLANCK.\n(c) (Temperature fluctuations) The creation of temperature fluctuations in CMB\nby variations in the gravitational potential is known as the Sachs-Wolfe effect.\nWhich one of the following statements is not correct concerning this effect?\n(i) A CMB photon is redshifted when climbing out of a gravitational potential\nwell, and is blueshifted when falling down a potential hill.\n(ii) At the time of last scattering, the nonbaryonic dark matter dominated the\nenergy density, and hence the gravitational potential, of the universe.\n\n8.286 QUIZ 3 REVIEW PROBLEMS, FALL 2013\np. 11\n(iii) The large-scale fluctuations in CMB temperatures arise from the grav-\nitational effect of primordial density fluctuations in the distribution of\nnonbaryonic dark matter.\n(iv) The peaks in the plot of temperature fluctuation ∆T vs. multipole l are\ndue to variations in the density of nonbaryonic dark matter, while the\ncontributions from baryons alone would not show such peaks.\n(d) (Dark matter candidates) Which one of the following is not a candidate of\nnonbaryonic dark matter?\n(i) massive neutrinos\n(ii) axions\n(iii) matter made of top quarks (a type of quarks with heavy mass of about\n171 GeV).\n(iv) WIMPs (Weakly Interacting Massive Particles)\n(v) primordial black holes\n(e) (Signatures of dark matter) By what methods can signatures of dark matter\nbe detected? List two methods. (Grading: 3 points for one correct answer,\n5 points for two correct answers.\nIf you give more than two answers, your\nscore will be based on the number of right answers minus the number of wrong\nanswers, with a lower bound of zero.)\n∗PROBLEM 2: DID YOU DO THE READING? (25 points)\nThis problem was Problem 1, Quiz 3, 2009.\n(a) (10 points) This question concerns some numbers related to the cosmic mi-\ncrowave background (CMB) that one should never forget. State the values of\nthese numbers, to within an order of magnitude unless otherwise stated. In all\ncases the question refers to the present value of these quantities.\n(i) The average temperature T of the CMB (to within 10%).\n(ii) The speed of the Local Group with respect to the CMB, expressed as a\nfraction v/c of the speed of light. (The speed of the Local Group is found\nby measuring the dipole pattern of the CMB temperature to determine\nthe velocity of the spacecraft with respect to the CMB, and then removing\nspacecraft motion, the orbital motion of the Earth about the Sun, the Sun\nabout the galaxy, and the galaxy relative to the center of mass of the Local\nGroup.)\n\n8.286 QUIZ 3 REVIEW PROBLEMS, FALL 2013\np. 12\n(iii) The intrinsic relative temperature fluctuations ∆T/T, after removing the\ndipole anisotropy corresponding to the motion of the observer relative to\nthe CMB.\n(iv) The ratio of baryon number density to photon number density, η =\nnbary/nγ.\n(v) The angular size θH, in degrees, corresponding to what was the Hubble\ndistance c/H at the surface of last scattering. This answer must be within\na factor of 3 to be correct.\n(b) (3 points) Because photons outnumber baryons by so much, the exponential\ntail of the photon blackbody distribution is important in ionizing hydrogen\nwell after kTγ falls below QH = 13.6 eV. What is the ratio kTγ/QH when the\nionization fraction of the universe is 1/2?\n(i) 1/5\n(ii) 1/50\n(iii) 10-3\n(iv) 10-4\n(v) 10-5\n(c) (2 points) Which of the following describes the Sachs-Wolfe effect?\n(i) Photons from fluid which had a velocity toward us along the line of sight\nappear redder because of the Doppler effect.\n(ii) Photons from fluid which had a velocity toward us along the line of sight\nappear bluer because of the Doppler effect.\n(iii) Photons from overdense regions at the surface of last scattering appear\nredder because they must climb out of the gravitational potential well.\n(iv) Photons from overdense regions at the surface of last scattering appear\nbluer because they must climb out of the gravitational potential well.\n(v) Photons traveling toward us from the surface of last scattering appear\nredder because of absorption in the intergalactic medium.\n(vi) Photons traveling toward us from the surface of last scattering appear\nbluer because of absorption in the intergalactic medium.\n(d) (10 points) For each of the following statements, say whether it is true or false:\n(i) Dark matter interacts through the gravitational, weak, and electromag-\nnetic forces.\nT or F ?\n(ii) The virial theorem can be applied to a cluster of galaxies to find its total\nmass, most of which is dark matter.\nT or F ?\n(iii) Neutrinos are thought to comprise a significant fraction of the energy den-\nsity of dark matter.\nT or F ?\n\n8.286 QUIZ 3 REVIEW PROBLEMS, FALL 2013\np. 13\n(iv) Magnetic monopoles are thought to comprise a significant fraction of the\nenergy density of dark matter.\nT or F ?\n(v) Lensing observations have shown that MACHOs cannot account for the\ndark matter in galactic halos, but that as much as 20% of the halo mass\ncould be in the form of MACHOs.\nT or F ?\n∗PROBLEM 3:\nNUMBER DENSITIES IN THE COSMIC BACK-\nGROUND RADIATION\nToday the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation is 2.7*K.\nCalculate the number density of photons in this radiation. What is the number\ndensity of thermal neutrinos left over from the big bang?\n∗PROBLEM 4: PROPERTIES OF BLACK-BODY RADIATION (25\npoints)\nThe following problem was Problem 4, Quiz 3, 1998.\nIn answering the following questions, remember that you can refer to the for-\nmulas at the front of the exam. Since you were not asked to bring calculators, you\nmay leave your answers in the form of algebraic expressions, such as π32/\n5ζ(3).\n(a) (5 points) For the black-body radiation (also called thermal radiation\np\n) of pho-\ntons at temperature T, what is the average energy per photon?\n(b) (5 points) For the same radiation, what is the average entropy per photon?\n(c) (5 points) Now consider the black-body radiation of a massless boson which has\nspin zero, so there is only one spin state. Would the average energy per particle\nand entropy per particle be different from the answers you gave in parts (a)\nand (b)? If so, how would they change?\n(d) (5 points) Now consider the black-body radiation of electron neutrinos. These\nparticles are fermions with spin 1/2, and we will assume that they are massless\nand have only one possible spin state. What is the average energy per particle\nfor this case?\n(e) (5 points) What is the average entropy per particle for the black-body radiation\nof neutrinos, as described in part (d)?\n\n8.286 QUIZ 3 REVIEW PROBLEMS, FALL 2013\np. 14\nPROBLEM 5: A NEW SPECIES OF LEPTON\nThe following problem was Problem 2, Quiz 3, 1992, worth 25 points.\nSuppose the calculations describing the early universe were modified by includ-\ning an additional, hypothetical lepton, called an 8.286ion. The 8.286ion has roughly\nthe same properties as an electron, except that its mass is given by mc2 = 0.750\nMeV.\nParts (a)-(c) of this question require numerical answers, but since you were\nnot told to bring calculators, you need not carry out the arithmetic. Your answer\nshould be expressed, however, in \"calculator-ready\" form-- that is, it should be an\nexpression involving pure numbers only (no units), with any necessary conversion\nfactors included. (For example, if you were asked how many meters a light pulse in\nvacuum travels in 5 minutes, you could express the answer as 2.998 × 108 × 5 × 60.)\na) (5 points) What would be the number density of 8.286ions, in particles per\ncubic meter, when the temperature T was given by kT = 3 MeV?\nb) (5 points) Assuming (as in the standard picture) that the early universe is\naccurately described by a flat, radiation-dominated model, what would be the\nvalue of the mass density at t = .01 sec? You may assume that 0.75 MeV ≪\nkT ≪100 MeV, so the particles contributing significantly to the black-body\nradiation include the photons, neutrinos, e+-e-pairs, and 8.286ion-anti8286ion\npairs. Express your answer in the units of g/cm3.\nc) (5 points) Under the same assumptions as in (b), what would be the value of\nkT, in MeV, at t = .01 sec?\nd) (5 points) When nucleosynthesis calculations are modified to include the effect\nof the 8.286ion, is the production of helium increased or decreased? Explain\nyour answer in a few sentences.\ne) (5 points) Suppose the neutrinos decouple while kT ≫0.75 MeV. If the\n8.286ions are included, what does one predict for the value of Tν/Tγ today?\n(Here Tν denotes the temperature of the neutrinos, and Tγ denotes the tem-\nperature of the cosmic background radiation photons.)\n∗PROBLEM 6: A NEW THEORY OF THE WEAK INTERACTIONS\n(40 points)\nThis problem was Problem 3, Quiz 3, 2009.\nSuppose a New Theory of the Weak Interactions (NTWI) was proposed, which\ndiffers from the standard theory in two ways. First, the NTWI predicts that the\nweak interactions are somewhat weaker than in the standard model. In addition,\nthe theory implies the existence of new spin- 1\n2 particles (fermions) called the R+\n\n8.286 QUIZ 3 REVIEW PROBLEMS, FALL 2013\np. 15\nand R-, with a rest energy of 50 MeV (where 1 MeV = 106 eV). This problem will\ndeal with the cosmological consequences of such a theory.\nThe NTWI will predict that the neutrinos in the early universe will decouple\nat a higher temperature than in the standard model. Suppose that this decoupling\ntakes place at kT ≈200 MeV. This means that when the neutrinos cease to be\nthermally coupled to the rest of matter, the hot soup of particles would contain\nnot only photons, neutrinos, and e+-e-pairs, but also μ+, μ-, π+, π-, and π0\nparticles, along with the R+-R-pairs.\n(The muon is a particle which behaves\nalmost identically to an electron, except that its rest energy is 106 MeV. The pions\nare the lightest of the mesons, with zero angular momentum and rest energies of\n135 MeV and 140 MeV for the neutral and charged pions, respectively. The π+ and\nπ-are antiparticles of each other, and the π0 is its own antiparticle. Zero angular\nmomentum implies a single spin state.) You may assume that the universe is flat.\n(a) (10 points) According to the standard particle physics model, what is the mass\ndensity ρ of the universe when kT ≈200 MeV? What is the value of ρ at\nthis temperature, according to NTWI? Use either g/cm3 or kg/m3. (If you\nwish, you can save time by not carrying out the arithmetic. If you do this,\nhowever, you should give the answer in \"calculator-ready\" form, by which I\nmean an expression involving pure numbers (no units), with any necessary\nconversion factors included, and with the units of the answer specified at the\nend. For example, if asked how far light travels in 5 minutes, you could answer\n2.998 × 108 × 5 × 60 m.)\n(b) (10 points) According to the standard model, the temperature today of the\nthermal neutrino background should be (4/11)1/3Tγ, where Tγ is the tempera-\nture of the thermal photon background. What does the NTWI predict for the\ntemperature of the thermal neutrino background?\n(c) (10 points) According to the standard model, what is the ratio today of the\nnumber density of thermal neutrinos to the number density of thermal photons?\nWhat is this ratio according to NTWI?\n(d) (10 points) Since the reactions which interchange protons and neutrons involve\nneutrinos, these reactions \"freeze out\" at roughly the same time as the neutrinos\ndecouple. At later times the only reaction which effectively converts neutrons\nto protons is the free decay of the neutron. Despite the fact that neutron decay\nis a weak interaction, we will assume that it occurs with the usual 15 minute\nmean lifetime. Would the helium abundance predicted by the NTWI be higher\nor lower than the prediction of the standard model? To within 5 or 10%, what\nwould the NTWI predict for the percent abundance (by weight) of helium in\nthe universe? (As in part (a), you can either carry out the arithmetic, or leave\nthe answer in calculator-ready form.)\nUseful information: The proton and neutron rest energies are given by mp c2 =\n938.27 MeV and m c2 = 939.57 MeV, with (m\n-m )c2\nn\nn\np\n= 1.29 MeV. The\nmean lifetime for the neutron decay, n →p + e-+ ν e , is given by τ = 886 s.\n\n8.286 QUIZ 3 REVIEW PROBLEMS, FALL 2013\np. 16\n∗PROBLEM 7: DOUBLING OF ELECTRONS (10 points)\nThe following was on Quiz 3, 2011 (Problem 4):\nSuppose that instead of one species of electrons and their antiparticles, suppose\nthere was also another species of electron-like and positron-like particles. Suppose\nthat the new species has the same mass and other properties as the electrons and\npositrons.

In 2013 we have not yet talked about\nHubble crossings and the evolution of density perturbations, so this problem would\nnot be fair as worded. Actually, however, you have learned how to do these calcu-\nlations, so the problem would be fair if it described in more detail what needs to be\ncalculated.\nIn Problem Set 9 (2007) we calculated the time tH1(λ) of the first Hubble\ncrossing for a mode specified by its (physical) wavelength λ at the present time.\nIn this problem we will calculate the time tH2(λ) of the second Hubble crossing,\nthe time at which the growing Hubble length cH-1(t) catches up to the physical\nwavelength, which is also growing. At the time of the second Hubble crossing for the\nwavelengths of interest, the universe can be described very simply: it is a radiation-\ndominated flat universe. However, since λ is defined as the present value of the\nwavelength, the evolution of the universe between tH2(λ) and the present will also\nbe relevant to the problem. We will need to use methods, therefore, that allow for\nboth the matter-dominated era and the onset of the dark-energy-dominated era. As\nin Problem Set 9 (2007), the model universe that we consider will be described by\nthe WMAP 3-year best fit parameters:\n\n8.286 QUIZ 3 REVIEW PROBLEMS, FALL 2013\np. 19\nHubble expansion rate\nH0\n= 73.5 km · s-1 · Mpc-1\nNonrelativistic mass density\nΩm\n= 0.237\nVacuum mass density\nΩvac = 0.763\nCMB temperature\nTγ,0 = 2.725 K\nThe mass densities are defined as contributions to Ω, and hence describe the mass\ndensity of each constituent relative to the critical density.

The chemical potentials for the positrons (e+) and the\nanti-electron neutrinos (ν e) are then -μe and -μν, respectively, since the chemi-\ncal potential of a particle is always the negative of the chemical potential for the\nantiparticle.*\n(b) (10 points) Express the neutron/proton chemical potential difference μn -μp\nin terms of μe and μν.\nThe black-body radiation formulas at the beginning of the quiz did not allow for the\npossibility of a chemical potential, but they can easily be generalized.

In a companion paper written by\nDicke, Peebles, Roll and Wilkinson, the authors interpreted the radiation\nto be a relic of an early, hot, dense, and opaque state of the universe.\nExplanation: After subtracting the dipole contribution, the temperature\nfluctuation is about 1.1 × 10-5.\n(b) (CMB experiments) The current mean energy per CMB photon, about 6 ×\n10-4 eV, is comparable to the energy of vibration or rotation for a small\nmolecule such as H2O.\nThus microwaves with wavelengths shorter than\nλ ∼3 cm are strongly absorbed by water molecules in the atmosphere.

(I.e., the analysis of the intensity of the\nfluctuations as a function of multipole number shows that Ωtot ≈1, and\nthat dark energy contributes ΩΛ ≈0.7, baryonic matter contributes Ωbary ≈\n0.04, and dark matter contributes Ωdark matter ≈0.26.)\nThere are other possible answers as well, but these are the ones discussed by\nRyden in Chapters 8 and 9.\nPROBLEM 2: DID YOU DO THE READING?

Putting in the numbers yields\nkT = 8.02 MeV.\nd) The production of helium is increased. At any given temperature, the addi-\ntional particle increases the energy density.\nSince H ∝ρ1/2, the increased\nenergy density speeds the expansion of the universe-- the Hubble constant at\nany given temperature is higher if the additional particle exists, and the tem-\nperature falls faster. The weak interactions that interconvert protons and neu-\ntrons \"freeze out\" when they can no longer keep up with the rate of evolution\nof the universe. The reaction rates at a given temperature will be unaffected\nby the additional particle, but the higher value of H will mean that the tem-\nperature at which these rates can no longer keep pace with the universe will\noccur sooner. The freeze-out will therefore occur at a higher temperature. The\nequilibrium value of the ratio of neutron to proton densities is larger at higher\ntemperatures: nn/np ∝exp(-∆mc2/kT), where nn and np are the number\ndensities of neutrons and protons, and ∆m is the neutron-proton mass differ-\nence. Consequently, there are more neutrons present to combine with protons\nto build helium nuclei. In addition, the faster evolution rate implies that the\ntemperature at which the deuterium bottleneck breaks is reached sooner. This\nimplies that fewer neutrons will have a chance to decay, further increasing the\nhelium production.\ne) After the neutrinos decouple, the entropy in the neutrino bath is conserved\nseparately from the entropy in the rest of the radiation bath. Just after neu-\ntrino decoupling, all of the particles in equilibrium are described by the same\ntemperature which cools as T ∝1/a. The entropy in the bath of particles still\nin equilibrium just after the neutrinos decouple is\nS ∝grestT 3(t)a3(t)\n\n8.286 QUIZ 3 REVIEW PROBLEM SOLUTIONS, FALL 2013\np. 31\nwhere grest = gtot -gν = 9. By today, the e+ -e-pairs and the 8.286ion-\nanti8.286ion pairs have annihilated, thus transferring their entropy to the pho-\nton bath. As a result the temperature of the photon bath is increased relative\nto that of the neutrino bath.

When kT falls below 200 MeV in the NTWI, the\nneutrino interactions\nn + νe ↔p + e-\nand\nn + e+ ↔p + ν e\nthat maintain the thermal equilibrium balance between protons and neutrons\nno longer occur at a significant rate, so the ratio n/np is no longer controlled by\nthermal equilibrium. After kT falls below 200 MeV, the only process that can\nconvert neutrons to protons is the rather slow process of free neutron decay,\nwith a decay time τd of about 890 s. Thus, when the deuterium bottleneck\nbreaks at about 200 s, the number density of neutrons will be considerably\nhigher than in the standard model. Since essentially all of these neutrons will\nbecome bound into He nuclei, the higher neutron abundance of the NTWI\nimplies a\nhigher predicted He abundance.\nTo estimate the He abundance, note that if we temporarily ignore free neutron\ndecay, then the neutron-proton ratio would be frozen at about 1 and would\nremain 1 until the time of nucleosynthesis.\nAt the time of nucleosynthesis\nessentially all of these neutrons would be bound into He nuclei (each with 2\nprotons and 2 neutrons). For an initial 1:1 ratio of neutrons to protons, all\nthe neutrons and protons can be bound into He nuclei, with no protons left\nover in the form of hydrogen, so Y would equal 1. However, the free neutron\ndecay process will cause the ratio nn/np to fall below 1 before the start of\nnucleosynthesis, so the predicted value of Y would be less than 1.\nTo calculate how much less, note that Ryden estimates the start of nucleosyn-\nthesis at the time when the temperature reaches Tnuc, which is the temperature\nfor which a thermal equilibrium calculation gives nD/nn = 1. This corresponds\n\n8.286 QUIZ 3 REVIEW PROBLEM SOLUTIONS, FALL 2013\np. 36\nto what Weinberg refers to as the breaking of the deuterium bottleneck. The\ntemperature Tnuc is calculated in terms of η = nB/nγ and physical constants,\nso it would not be changed by the NTWI. The time when this temperature is\nreached, however, would be changed slightly by the change in the ratio Tν/Tγ.\nSince this effect is rather subtle, no points will be taken offif you omitted it.\nHowever, to be as accurate as possible, one should recognize that nucleosynthe-\nsis occurs during the radiation-dominated era, but long after the e+-e-pairs\nhave disappeared, so the black-body radiation consists of photons at tempera-\nture Tγ and neutrinos at a lower temperature Tν.

At freeze-out, when kT ≈200 MeV,\nnn\nnB\n≈\n.\nJust before nucleosynthesis, at time tnuc, the ratio will be\nnn\nt\nn\n≈\ne-nuc/τd .\nB\nIf free decay is ignored, we found Y = 1. Since all the surviving neutrons are\nbound into He, the corrected value of Y is simply deceased by multiplying by\nthe fraction of neutrons that do not undergo decay.

At the time when the electron-positron pairs disappear,\nthe neutrinos are decoupled, so their entropy is conserved.

(35 points)\n(a) (5 points) Ryden summarizes the results of the COBE satellite experiment for\nthe measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) in the form of\nthree important results. The first was that, in any particular direction of the\nsky, the spectrum of the CMB is very close to that of an ideal blackbody. The\nFIRAS instrument on the COBE satellite could have detected deviations from\nthe blackbody spectrum as small as ∆ε/ε ≈10-n, where n is an integer. To\nwithin ±1, what is n?\nAnswer: n = 4\n(b) (5 points) The second result was the measurement of a dipole distortion of\nthe CMB spectrum; that is, the radiation is slightly blueshifted to higher tem-\nperatures in one direction, and slightly redshifted to lower temperatures in\nthe opposite direction. To what physical effect was this dipole distortion at-\ntributed?\nAnswer: The large dipole in the CMB is attributed to the motion of the satellite\nrelative to the frame in which the CMB is very nearly isotropic. (The entire\nLocal Group is moving relative to this frame at a speed of about 0.002c.)\n(c) (5 points) The third result concerned the measurement of temperature fluctu-\nations after the dipole feature mentioned above was subtracted out. Defining\nδT\nT(θ, φ)\n(θ, φ)\n-⟨T⟩\n≡\n,\nT\n⟨T⟩\nwhere ⟨T⟩= 2.725 K, the average value of T, they found a root mean square\nfluctuation,\n\nδT\nT\n/2\n,\nequal to some number.

To within ± 3, what is m?\nAnswer: m = 18. (See the derivation in Lecture Notes 8.)\n(f) (5 points) The total energy density of the present universe consists mainly of\nbaryonic matter, dark matter, and dark energy. Give the percentages of each,\naccording to the best fit obtained from the Planck 2013 data. You will get full\ncredit if the first (baryonic matter) is accurate to ±2%, and the other two are\naccurate to within ±5%.\nAnswer: Baryonic matter: 5%. Dark matter: 26.5%. Dark energy: 68.5%.\nThe Planck 2013 numbers were given in Lecture Notes 7. To the requested\naccuracy, however, numbers such as Ryden's Benchmark Model would also be\nsatisfactory.\n(g) (5 points) Within the conventional hot big bang cosmology (without inflation),\nit is difficult to understand how the temperature of the CMB can be correlated\nat angular separations that are so large that the points on the surface of last\nscattering was separated from each other by more than a horizon distance. Ap-\nproximately what angle, in degrees, corresponds to a separation on the surface\nlast scattering of one horizon length? You will get full credit if your answer is\nright to within a factor of 2.\nAnswer: Ryden gives 1*as the angle subtended by the Hubble length on the\nsurface of last scattering. For a matter-dominated universe, which would be\na good model for our universe, the horizon length is twice the Hubble length.\nAny number from 1*to 5*was considered acceptable.\n\n8.286 QUIZ 3 SOLUTIONS, FALL 2013\np. 3\nPROBLEM 2: FREEZE-OUT OF MUONS (25 points)\nSee the solutions to Problem Set 7, Problem 2 (2013).\nPROBLEM 3:\nTHE EVENT HORIZON FOR OUR UNIVERSE (25\npoints)\n(a) In a spherical pulse each light ray is moving radially outward, so dθ = dφ = 0.\nA light ray travels along a null trajectory, meaning that ds2 = 0, so we have\nds2 = -c2 dt2 + a2(t) dr2 = 0 .\n(3.1)\nfrom which it follows that\ndr\nc\n=\n.\ndt\n±\n(3.2)\na(t)\nWe are interested in a radial pulse that starts at r = 0 at time t = t0, so the\nlimiting value of r is given by\nrmax =\ninf\nc\ndt .\n(3.3)\nt0\na(t)\n(b) Changing variables of integration to\na(t)\nx =\n,\n(3.4)\na(t0)\nthe integral becomes\ninf\nc\ndt\nc\ninf1 dt\nrmax =\n\ndx =\ndx ,\n(3.5)\na(t) dx\na(t0)\n\nx dx\nwhere we used the fact that t = t0 corresponds to x = a(t0)/a(t0) = 1.

In standard cos-\nmology without inflation, a mechanism to establish this uniformity\nwould need to transmit energy and information at about 100 times\nthe speed of light.\nInflationary\nSolution:\nIn inflationary models, the universe\nbegins so small that uniformity is easily established -- just like\nthe air in the lecture hall spreading to fill it uniformly.\nThen\ninflation stretches the region to be large enough to include the\nvisible universe.\nAlan\nGuth\nMassachusetts\nInstitute\nof\nT\nechnology\n8.286\nOpening\nLecture,\nSeptember\n5,\n-8-\n2)\n\\Flatness\nproblem:\"\nWhy was the early universe so FLAT?\nWhat is meant by \"flat\"?\nFlat does not mean 2-dimensional.\nFlat means Euclidean, as opposed to the\nnon-Euclidean curved spaces that are also\nallowed by Einstein's general relativity.\n3-dimensional curved spaces are hard to\nvisualize, but they are analogous to the\n2-dimensional curved surfaces shown on the\nright.\nAlan\nGuth\nMassachusetts\nInstitute\nof\nT\nechnology\n8.286\nOpening\nLecture,\nSeptember\n5,\n-9-\nAccording to general relativity, the flatness\nof the universe is related to its mass density:\nΩ(Omega) = actual mass density\ncritical mass density ,\nwhere the \"critical density\" depends on the\nexpansion rate.\nΩ= 1 is flat, Ωgreater\nthan 1 is closed, Ωless than 1 is open.\nAlan\nGuth\nMassachusetts\nInstitute\nof\nT\nechnology\n8.286\nOpening\nLecture,\nSeptember\n5,\n-10-\nA universe at the critical density is like a pencil balancing on its\ntip:\nIf Ωin the early universe was slightly below 1, it would rapidly\nfall to zero -- and no galaxies would form.\nIf Ωwas slightly greater than 1, it would rapidly rise to infinity,\nthe universe would recollapse, and no galaxies would form.\nTo be as close to critical density as we measure today, at one\nsecond after the big bang, Ωmust have been equal to one to 15\ndecimal places!\n-11-\nImage courtesy of IPAC.\nImage courtesy of IPAC.\n\nAlan Guth, Inflationary Cosmology: Is Our Universe Part of a Multiverse, 8.286 Opening Lecture, September 5, 2013, p. 4.\nInflationary\nSolution:\nSince inflation makes gravity become\nrepulsive, the evolution of Ωchanges, too. Ωis driven towards\none, extremely rapidly.

But typical magnitudes are ∼10120 times\ntoo large.\nThe Landscape of String Theory: String theory predicts ∼10500\nlong-lived, metastable \"vacua,\" any one of which can act as the\nvacuum for a pocket universe. Each would have its own value\nfor the vacuum energy densit ,y with values ranging from roughly\n10120 to +10120 times the observed value.\n-\nAlan\nGuth\nMassachusetts\nInstitute\nof\nT\nechnology\n8.286\nLecture\n2,\nSeptember\n10,\n-5-\nThe\nLandscape\nand\nEnvironmental\nSelection\nAKA:\nThe\nAnthropic\nPrinciple\nIf the landscape has 10500 vacua, and a fraction 10-120 have small vacuum\nenergy densities like our universe, then we expect about\n10-120 × 10500 = 10380\nvacua with low energy densities like ours.\nBut how could we explain why we are living in such a fantastically unusual\ntype of vacuum?\nConsider, as an example, the local density of matter in which we find ourselves\n-- it is about 1030 times larger than the mean density of the visible universe.\nWhy is this so? Chance? Luck? Divine Providence?\nMost of us would presumably accept this as a selection effect: life can evolve\nonly in those rare regions of the universe where the density of matter is\nunusually high.\n-6-\nAs early as 1987, Steve Weinberg pointed out that the vacuum\nenergy density might be explained in the same wa .y\nMaybe the vacuum energy density IS huge in most pocket\nuniverses. Nonetheless, we need to remember that vacuum energy\ncauses the expansion of the universe to accelerate. If large and\nnegative, the universe quickly collapses.\nIf large and positive,\nthe universe flies apart before galaxies can form. It is plausible,\ntherefore, that life can arise only if the vacuum energy density is\nvery near zero.\nIn 1998 Martel, Shapiro, and Weinberg made a serious calculation\nof the effect of the vacuum energy density on galaxy formation.\nThey found that to within a factor of order 5, they could \"explain\"\nwhy the vacuum energy density is as small as what we measure.\nAlan\nGuth\nMassachusetts\nInstitute\nof\nT\nechnology\n8.286\nLecture\n2,\nSeptember\n10,\n-7-\n\nAlan Guth, Inflationary Cosmology: Is Our Universe Part of a Multiverse, Part 2, 8.286 Lecture 2, September 10, 2013, p. 3.\nThe\nControversy\nA number of physicists regard these anthropic arguments as\nridiculous.\nMy recommendation is that the anthropic explanation (for a\n-\nny\nthing) should be considered the explanation of last resort.\nUntil we actually understand the landscape, and the initiation\nof life, we can only give plausibility arguments for anthropic\nexplanations.\nHence, the anthropic arguments only become attactive when\nthe search for more deterministic explanations has failed, as\nso far is the case for the vacuum energy densit .y (Anthropic\nexplanations are also discussed for many other quantities,\nincluding the Higgs mass, the top quark mass, the magnitude\nof density perturbations.)\n-8-\nIs\nIt\nTime\nto\nAccept\nThe\nExplanation\nof\nLast\nResort?\nYour\nguess\nis\nas\ngood\nas\nmine!\nFor the vacuum energy densit ,y because it seems so hard to explain\nany other wa ,y it seems like it is time to strongly consider the\nselection-effect explanation.\nIt is even hard to deny that, as of now, the selection-effect\nexplanation is by far the most plausible that is known.\nAlan\nGuth\nMassachusetts\nInstitute\nof\nT\nechnology\n8.286\nLecture\n2,\nSeptember\n10,\n-9-\nSUMMARY\nThe\nInflationary\nParadigm\nis\nin\nGreat\nShape!\nExplains large scale uniformity.\nPredicts the mass density of the universe to better than 1%\naccuracy.\nExplains the ripples we see in the cosmic background radiation as\nthe result of quantum fluctuations.\nAlan\nGuth\nMassachusetts\nInstitute\nof\nT\nechnology\n8.286\nLecture\n2,\nSeptember\n10,\n-10-\nThree\nWinds\nBlowing\nUs\nTowards\nthe\nMultiverse\n1)\nAlmost all inflationary models are eternal into the future.

But if the matter was\nevenly disposed throughout an infinite space, it could never convene into one\nmass; but some of it would convene into one mass and some into another, so as\nto make an infinite number of great masses, scattered at great distances from\none to another throughout all that infinite space. And thus might the sun and\nfixed stars be formed, supposing the matter were of a lucid nature.\n-- December 10, 1692\n-1-\nBut how the matter should divide itself into two sorts, and that part of it which\nis to compose a shining body should fall down into one mass and make a sun\nand the rest which is fit to compose an opaque body should coalesce, not into\none great body, like the shining matter, but into many little ones; or if the sun\nat first were an opaque body like the planets or the planets lucid bodies like\nthe sun, how he alone should be changed into a shining body whilst all they\ncontinue opaque, or all they be changed into opaque ones whilst he remains\nunchanged, I do not think explicable by mere natural causes, but am forced to\nascribe it to the counsel and contrivance of a voluntary Agent.\n-- December 10, 1692\nWeb references: http://www.newtonproject.sussex.ac.uk/view/texts/normalized/THEM00254\nhttp://books.google.com/books?id=8DkCAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA201\n-2-\nIsaac\nNewton\nto\nRichard\nBentley,\nLetter\nNewton\non\nInfinities\nBut you argue, in the next paragraph of your letter, that every particle of\nmatter in an infinite space has an infinite quantity of matter on all sides, and,\nby consequence, an infinite attraction every way, and therefore must rest in\nequilibrio, because all infinites are equal. Yet you suspect a paralogism in this\nargument; and I conceive the paralogism lies in the position, that all infinites\nare equal.\nThe generality of mankind consider infinites no other ways than\nindefinitely; and in this sense they say all infinites are equal; though they would\nspeak more truly if they should say, they are neither equal nor unequal, nor have\nany certain difference or proportion one to another. In this sense, therefore,\nno conclusions can be drawn from them about the equality, proportions, or\ndifferences of things; and they that attempt to do it usually fall into paralogisms.\n-- January 17, 1693\n-3-\n\nAlan Guth, Cosmological Redshift and the Dynamics of Homogeneous Expansion 8.286 Lecture 5, September 19, 2013, p. 2.\nSo, when men argue against the infinite divisibility of magnitude, by saying,\nthat if an inch may be divided into an infinite number of parts, the sum of\nthose parts will be an inch; and if a foot may be divided into an infinite number\nof parts, the sum of those parts must be a foot; and therefore, since all infinites\nare equal, those sums must be equal, that is, an inch equal to a foot.
