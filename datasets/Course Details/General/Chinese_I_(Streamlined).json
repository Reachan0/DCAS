The focus of the course is on learning standard everyday usage, on reading in both full and simplified characters, and on writing.\n\nCharacters and Pinyin\n\nStudents are expected to be able to read texts written in either the full or simplified sets of Chinese characters, but are free to choose either one in writing. The website of \"\nHanyu Pinyin for Mandarin Speakers\n\" has a guide to the Pinyin system. You may access it any time to refresh your memory.\n\nRequired Learning Materials\n\nWheatley, Julian.\nLearning Chinese: A Foundation Course in Mandarin\n.\nYale University Press, 2014.

We will also introduce the basics of Character Writing. By the fifth week, we will begin the first lesson in your textbook,\nA Primer for Advanced Beginners of Chinese\nVol. 1 (Daxue Yuwen / 大學語文 / 大学语文), and we will be covering approximately one lesson in that book per week.\n\nClassroom activities will include discussing the content of the texts, short reports, and performance based on the texts, practicing some of the relevant grammatical patterns, sight reading of supplementary materials, and almost daily quizzes.\n\nWriting:\nYou will be asked to learn a selection of the characters introduced in the lesson, not all of them (see \"Dictations\" in \"Grading\"). And you will be asked to learn to recognize both simplified and full form characters from memory. For writing, you may choose one, full form or simplified, as you prefer.\n\nGrading\n\nACTIVITIES\n\nPERCENTAGES\n\nClass Performance-\n\nAttendance 5%\n\nPromptness 3%\n\nPreparedness 5%\n\nClass Report 7%\n\nParticipation 10%\n\n30%\n\nWritten Assignments\n\n20%\n\nLingt Speaking Assignments\n\n5%\n\nBi-weekly Tests\n\n30%\n\nVocabulary Quizzes and Dictations\n\n10%\n\nEnd-of-term Essay\n\n5%\n\nGrading Rubric\n\nGRADES\n\nPOINTS\n\nA\n\n100-95\n\nA-\n\n94.9-90\n\nB+\n\n89.9-86.7\n\nB\n\n86.6-83.3\n\nB-\n\n83.2-80\n\nC+\n\n79.9-75\n\nC\n\n74.9-70\n\nC-\n\n69.9-60\n\nF\n\nbelow 60\n\nFor the Vocabulary Quizzes and Dictations, vocabulary quizzes are done at the beginning of the first of the two periods devoted to each lesson. You will need to transcribe a sentence into Pinyin and translate it into English. Dictations of selected required characters are done after the two periods devoted to each lesson.\n\nFor the End-of-term Essay, a 2-page double-space typewritten essay using Microsoft Word with 16-point font. More instructions on how to input Chinese characters using pinyin are available in the\nTools and Resources\nsection.\n\nAttendance and promptness is assumed; more than three unexcused absences (a week's worth) lowers your grade one letter; significant lateness will add up to absences. Twice during the semester, if you are late for class without telling your instructor in advance and miss a quiz, you are allowed to take the quiz at the end of the class.\n\nAbsences will count as excused ones only if you provide a doctor's note or a note from your academic advisor to the instructor.\n\nOther factors may come into play, e.g. improvement versus stagnation or deterioration over the course of the semester, and progress relative to starting level.\n\nThere are No Make-ups for quizzes and tests if you do not notify your instructor about your absence first but however, your lowest two quiz grades will be dropped. If you cannot take the quizzes on time, you should talk to the instructor to make arrangements for you to take the quizzes before your classmates do.\n\nThere is no final examination this term.\n\nHomework handed in late will not receive full credit. You will lose one point per day of lateness. For example, you will receive 9 out 10 points if you turn it in the next day.\n\nEnd-of-Term Essay\n\nWhat: A double-spaced typewritten essay of no less than 2 full pages using Microsoft World (16 point font) with 1 inch margins on all sides\nOr\na single-space handwritten essay using our own Calligraphy Grid of no less than 4 full pages. Do not try to fill up the pages with extra space between characters and / or paragraphs. What weights more is the content. Learn how to input Chinese characters if you do not already know how.\n\nTopic: You may choose from one of the following topics.\n\nTopic 1: Write about a person who has had a great impact on your world outlook, and who you are today.\n\nTopic 2: Write about an event that has had a great impact on your world outlook, and who you are today.\n\nGrading (5% of class grade):\n\nContent: 2.5 points (convincing / enticing)\n\nDegree of sophistication of languages: 1.5 points (when appropriate, incorporate the grammar, sentence patters, and vocabulary we have learned into your essay)\n\nOver-all structure: 1 point (make sure each paragraph has a focus and the paragraphs relate to on another in a logical way)\n\nAdvice on Approaching the Class\n\nEngaging in a language class should not feel like a chore that you resent having to perform. If it does, you should probably do some serious thinking about why you are enrolled. A language, foreign or semi-native, is a discipline to be studied with attention and dedication. It requires a high level of concentration, and a systematic, steady approach. It is in fact a never ending process, which involves a consistent accumulation of data (vocabulary) to be applied within a complex framework (grammar). As such, learning a language can be occasionally frustrating and so it should be dealt with patiently. But the result of understanding of a language provides lifelong satisfaction. If you approach this course by wondering how little work you can do and still get by, or if you approach this course by thinking only about what grade you are getting instead of what you are learning, then you will not succeed. If, however, you approach this class with dedication and a positive attitude, you will be rewarded with the satisfaction that comes from the genuine acquisition of knowledge and skill\n.",
