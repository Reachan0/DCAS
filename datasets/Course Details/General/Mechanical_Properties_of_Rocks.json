  "syllabus_content": "Course Meeting Times\n\nLectures: 2 sessions / week, 1 hour / session\n\nLabs/Recitations: 1 session / week, 1 hour / session\n\nGoals\n\nUnderstand processes by which rocks deform during natural tectonic processes.\n\nClarify some relations between (micro) structure and properties; identify fingerprints for each mechanism.\n\nRecognize parameters important for determining rock strength and understand the implications for natural processes.\n\nDevelop constitutive laws for use in geodynamic modeling.\n\nFormat\n\nReading for Each Meeting\n\nRead the background material in enough detail to be able to discuss it in class; if you are unfamiliar with it, formulate questions about areas that you don't understand. Class notes and, if possible, readings will be posted on the server.\n\nWeekly Problem Sets and Lab Experiments\n\nEach week on Wednesday, I'll hand out a problem set or laboratory exercise. The assignments will roughly alternate between a problem set and a \"hands-on\" exercise. Each exercise or problem set is due at the end of the following week. Please do not get behind on the problem sets; if after a couple of hours of working you get nowhere, feel free to talk with other class members. Collaboration is OK, but each student should do enough individual work to understand the problem and be able to apply the concepts to his or her own research and reading.\n\nFinal Paper\n\nThere will be no final exam. In lieu of a final, each student will write a 5-10 page paper that uses some of the class material to treat a problem in geologic sciences or engineering. Please discuss the topic of your paper with me, before you get underway. During the last two classes of the term, students will present their papers and discuss them with the class.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nPhysics III, Vibrations and Waves (8.03) and Differential Equations (18.03)\n\nGrading\n\nACTIVITIES\n\nPERCENTAGES\n\nProblem Sets\n\n20%\n\nLabs\n\n20%\n\nMidterm\n\n20%\n\nFinal Paper\n\n40%",

      "content": "Laboratory II: Mechanical Properties of Rocks\n(Due: October 21, 2005)\nUsing the Paterson gas-medium apparatu s , you will measure axial load, axial\ndisplacement, and determine the Young's modulus, yield strength of an intact rock core specimen.\n1. Experiment Description\nInitial Sample\nA sample of Carrara Marble has been prepared for a triaxial compression test. The sample is a\nright-cylinder, 10 mm in diameter and 20 mm long. Porosity is estimated to be ~ 0.1%.\nMeasurement\nUsing the load cell in the Paterson gas-medium apparatus, apply a constant displacement rate on\nthe sample and see how the load changes. We will record axial load (kN), LVDT (Linear\nVariable Displacement Transducer) position (mm), confining pressure (MPa) and temperature (oC)\nat a certain time intervals. The axial load increases with increasing strain rates and we will apply\nthree different strain rates to the sample. The summary data file will be posted on the web page\nlater and will include the sample dimensions and the deformation conditions.\nCalculation\nAxial stress\nDuring the deformation experiment, we measure axial load rather than axial stress (also called\ncompressional stress, differential stress or true stress). It is therefore necessary to convert\ninternal loads to stress. Axial stress is equal to the axial load F divided by the cross-section area\nof the sample (A),\nF\nσ =\n(1)\nA\nThe data file measured load in kN. Stress should be converted to MPa. The variation of the\ncross-section during deformation must be taken into account (especially for large strains). We\nassume the volume of sample is constant throughout the deformation, AL = constant (where L is\nthe length of the sample).\nAxial strain\nDisplacement for triaxial displacement test will be measured using a LVDT located outside the\npressure vessel. The LVDT measure not only the displacement of the sample due to an applied\nload but also the displacement of the deformation column.\nL\n∆ measured\n∆\n= Lsample\n∆\n+ Lcolumn\n(2)\n\n-\n-\nIn order to calculate the axial strain of the sample, you must subtract out the deformation of the\ncolumn. The contribution of the column to the measured displacement can be calculated by\nknowing the applied compressive load F and the stiffness of the deformation column Ccolumn.\n/\nL\n∆ column =\nC\nF\ncolumn\n(3)\nThe stiffness of the deformation column has already been calculated for you and is 61.5 kN mm-1.\nAs the length of the sample varies with time from an initial value L0 to a final value L(t), we\nobtain the instantaneous value of the total strain (natural strain or compressional strain) at time t\nby integration.\nt\nL\n) dL = ln⎜⎜\n⎛ L(t) ⎞⎟\n∆ L\n(4)\nε sample = ∫ L0\n(\nL\n⎝ L0 ⎠⎟ ≈ L0\nWhere the sign + and - respectively correspond to extension and compression. To be simple, we\nuse the positive value in the compressional test. The approximation is correct at small strains\nonly.\nPower law equation\n-\nThe strain-rate ε is determined as the slope of the creep curve ε(t). The power-law equation\ndescribes quite well the dislocation creep behavior of a considerable number of materials in the\nstress range that corresponds to laboratory experimental conditions.\n-\n-\nn\nQ ⎞\nε = ε 0 σ exp⎜⎛-\n⎟\n(5)\n⎝ RT ⎠\n-\nWhere ε 0 is a pre-exponential factor perhaps containing chemical fugacity, σ is the differential\nstress, n\n∂\n= lnε / ∂ lnσ is the stress exponent, Q\n∂\n-\n=\nlnε / ∂ (1/ T) is the activation energy\nR\nfor creep, and RT is the standard Boltzmann term.\n-\nNote that the log ε - logσ plot is seldom linear over a wide range of applied stresses, and the\npower-law equation does not hold at all stresses.\n2. Exercises\nThere are two text files named carrara marble_rheology.txt and solnhofen limestone.txt, using the\nsolnhofen limestone.txt, do the exercise 1-3; then use the carrara marble_rheology.txt to do the\nexercise 4. (one ref. on Carrara Marble: S.J. Covey-Crump, Evolution of mechanical state in\nCarrara marble during deformation at 400 to 700oC, JGR, 103(B12),p29,781-29,794 (1998))\n1. An experiment begins when the compressive stress begins to increase. Note this value of\nstress, and correct the stress and displacements measured at this point in the spreadsheet to\nzero. Calculate the compressional stress σtrue using equation 1. As discussed above, the\n\nmeasured displacement is the sum of the displacement of the sample and the displacement of\nthe deformed column (equation 2). Compute the displacement of the sample using equation\n(2) and (3) and plot the compressional stress versus the displacement of the sample on the\nsame plot as compressional stress versus measured displacement. Compare the two plots.\n2. Convert the calculated displacement of the sample to strain using equation (2) through (4),\nand plot compressional stress versus axial strain for the sample. The plot of compressional\nstress versus axial strain yields the best description of the deformation behavior of the\nspecimen.

Compare the values of Young's modulus, yield strength of Carrara Marble with other calcite\nrocks (Table 1). Explain.\n2. For the plot of axial stress versus axial strain of different materials, one would expect different\nmechanical behavior (figure 1). Which kind of behavior do you observe in this experiment?\nAnd which factors will affect its behavior (e.g. strain rate, temperature and grain size) and\nhow?\n-\n3. How do you expect the relationship between the log ε and logσ will change at different\nstresses?\n4. Effective pressure, confining pressure minus pore pressure, can play a large role in the\nstrength of rocks. What effect do you think increasing the confining pressure would have on\nYoung's modulus, yield stress?\n5. For the plot of axial stress vs. axial strain for solnhofen limestone, do you observe a nonlinear\nstress-strain relationship at low stress level?

Karato, and H.-R. Wenk, pp. 137-179,\nMineralogical Society of America, Wash. D. C., 2002.\nNicolas, J., and J.P. Poirier, Crystalline plasticity and solid state flow in metamorphic\nrocks, 444 pp., Wiley-Interscience, 1976.\n\nBurgers vectors sf/RH\nThe Burgers vector, b, indicates the displacement suffered by the crystal as the\ndislocation passes. When the dislocation exits the crystal, the surface expression exhibits\na step with a depth . Thus the Burgers vector is often called the slip direction. By\nconvention the direction of the Burgers vector is given by completing a circuit of integral\nsteps around the dislocation, keeping the dislocation line length on the right hand side.\nThe closure failure from finish to start defines the Burgers vector.\nb\n\nIn the schematic below the dislocation is contained within the yellow ellipse. A circuit of\n5 lattice vectors is shown. The yellow arrow shows the magnitude and direction of the\nclosure failure. The region close to the dislocation that is highly disturbed is called the\ndislocation core (approximated by the ellipse). The exact displacements of the ions in the\ncore region may change as the dislocation moves through the crystal. In general the core\nregion has an associated volume increase and a bonding scheme that is substantially\ndifferent from that in the defect-free portion of the crystal. Consequently it may be a\nregion of enhanced diffusivity. The core region is probably a few lattice parameters wide;\nand outside this region, ions are displaced from their equilibrium postions by amounts\nthat can be accommodated by elastic distortions.\nRH/sf\n\n12.524 2003\nLec 17b: Dislocation Geometry in Minerals\n2.\n\nDislocation line vectors\nAt any given point, the tangent to the dislocation core region, is defined as the dislocation\nline vector l. The sense of positive direction of l is somewhat arbitrary, but once chosen\nshould be consistent along the entire length of the dislocation. In the example above, the\nline direction is positive into the paper. By considering slightly more complicated\nBurgers circuits, one may prove that the Burger vector must remain unchanged along\nentire length of the dislocation. Thus, if the dislocation changes its direction in the crystal\nthe relation between the line direction and the Burgers vector changes.\nEdge and screw\nWhen the line direction and the Burgers\nvector are perpendicular the dislocation\nis said to be an edge dislocation. When\nthe two are parallel, it is said to be a\nscrew dislocation. When the line length\nand Burgers vector make some other\nangle the dislocation is said to have\nmixed character.\nξ\nξ\nξ\nb\nb\nb\nThe dislocation may be curved along its\nlength when viewed at a scale of many\nlattice dimensions. Clearly, the character\nof the dislocation may vary from edge to\nscrew along its length.\nIf the dislocation moves completely\nthrough the crystal, one portion of the\ncrystal is displaced relative to the other\nby one Burgers vector.\n\nDislocation reactions:\nOwing to the fact that the dislocation separates the portion of the crystal that has been\ndistorted from that which has not, it can be proven that a dislocation cannot end in the\ncrystal. It may loop back upon itself, terminate at a grain boundary, surface, or interphase\nboundary, or react with other dislocations. When the latter occurs, the vector sum of the\nBurgers vectors must be equal.\n\n12.524 2003\nLec 17b: Dislocation Geometry in Minerals\n3.\nb1\nb1\nb2\nb2\nb3\nb3\n\nSlip planes\nThe slip plane is a plane whose normal is\n\nn = b ×ξ\nA dislocation that is composed of short edge and screw segments is said to be kinked.\nWhen the dislocation departs from its slip plane, it is said to be jogged.\nMotion of the dislocation along a given slide plane is called glide and can be\naccommodated at relatively low temperatures. When the dislocation move perpendicular\nto the glide plane it is climbing. This motion requires diffusion of ions towards or away\nfrom the dislocation and can only be accomplished at higher temperatures or lower strain\nrates than the glide motion.\n\nKink in plane\nJog out of plane\n\nMotion of the dislocaition only occurs normal\nto its line direction. When an edge dislocation\nmoves along its glide plane, no material needs\nto be removed from the crystal. The motion of\nthe dislocation is said to be conservative\nMotion of a screw dislocation never involves\ndiffusion, because there is no unique slip plane (b\n). Motion of a screw segment from\none lattice plane to another is called cross slip.\nξ\n&\n\n12.524 2003\nLec 17b: Dislocation Geometry in Minerals\n4.\nDislocation slip systems in minerals.\nThe combination of a slip plane and a Burgers vector is called a slip system. Dislocation\nsegments in a given slip system can be either edge and screw as long as they have the\nsame Burgers vector. When the crystal is loaded externally to values high enough to\ncause slip, the dislocation moves, and small atomic adjustments are made in the core\nstructure. The adjustments must be periodic as the dislocation moves from one lattice\npoint to another. The energy necessary to cause the movements is provided by the work\ndone on the system by the external forces. The stress necessary to cause slip, often called\nlattice friction, depends on the detailed crystal geometry, and will, therefore, differ from\none slip system to another. Some systems will be easier to activate than others. For\nelastically isotropic crystals, several rules of thumb can be used to predict the ease of slip:\n\nIn general, slip planes that are widely spaced and densely packed will be\npreferred, because widely spaced planes are likely to indicate weaker bonding.\nShort Burgers vectors are preferred, because the elastic distortion surrounding the\ndislocation will be minimized.\nIn poly ionic materials, those that are elastically anisotropic, (i.e. minerals) or\nwhen bonding is dominantly covalent, these rules may be broken.\n\n12.524 2003\nLec 17b: Dislocation Geometry in Minerals\n5.\n\nSystem\n(Plane) <b>\n(nm)\nremark\n\nCalcite r -\n(\n)\n0.810\nStructural cell\nRhombohedral\n\nr +\n(\n)\n\nShortest vector 1\n3 2110\n\nf -\n(\n)\n\nNext, 1\n3 0111\n\nf +\n(\n)\n\na\n(\n)\n\nc\n(\n)\n\n(\n)\n\nQuartz\na on c\n(\n)\n0001 1120\n0.49\nWet quartz,\nLow T, High ε\nTrigonal\n\nc on a\n(\n)\n0.54\nWet quartz\n[Kirby and McCormick, 1984]\n{Linker, 1981 #4307}\n\na on m\n(\n)\n1010 1210\n0.49\n\n{Linker, 1981 #4307}\n\nc+aon m\n(\n)\n1010 1213\n\nOlivine\n(100) 001\n\nLow T, High str rt.\nOrthorhombic\n\n(110) 001\n\n\"\n\n(100) 010\n\n{Dubious}\n\n(100) 001\n\nMedium T, str. rt.\n\n(0\n) 100\nhk\n\n\"\n\n(001) 100\n\n\"\n\n(010) 100\n\nHigh T, low str. + above\n\n{Cordier, 2002 #4304}\n\nExample 1.

Y., 1970.\nPoirier, J.-P., Creep of crystals: High-temperature deformation processes in metals,\nceramics, and minerals, 260 pp., Cambridge, 1985.\nLattice points, crystal basis, and crystal lattices:\n1. Lattice point: Two equivalent lattice points are points in space for which the\nsurroundings (atomic positions and identitities) are identical. Any point in space\nin the lattice may be chosen as the origin.\n2. The chemical surroundings of each lattice point are identical with those of each\nand every other lattice point.\n3. An ensemble of lattice points is a mesh in 2d or a lattice in 3d.\nIn a 1 mm cube of NaCl (cubic lattice with lattice dimension of 5.64 angstroms),\nthere are about 2 million lattice points in one direction, or about 8x1018 lattice\npoints in the cube!\n4. The actual disposition of the atoms or ions around each lattice point is called the\ncrystal basis. Depending on the details of the bonding and the crystal chemistry,\nthe crystal basis may contain more that one stoichiometric unit.\n5. The actual crystal itself is a combination of the crystal basis and the crystal lattice.\nThe crystal structure is completely defined and represented by repeating the\ncrystal basis at every lattice point.\n6. Depending on the geometry and symmetry of the crystal, every crystal lattice can\nbe included within one of seven crystal systems or one of 14 classes represented\nby unique Bravais crystal space lattices.\n7. A vector connecting one lattice point to another is a lattice vector. Because each\nlattice point repeats at a fixed interval, three non-coplanar vectors are sufficient to\nspan the space of all lattice points in three dimensions. The three smallest vectors\nare called primitive lattice vectors and define a unit cell, the primitive unit cell,\nthat contains the smallest volume that can be stacked repeatedly to produce the\nentire crystal. By convention the unit cell is chosen so that the crystallographic\naxes contain an obtuse angle unless the axes are perpendicular to each other.\n8. Every lattice vector may be expressed as a linear combination of an integral\nnumber of the primitive unit vectors. Remember that the lattice vectors do not\n\n12.524 2003\nLec 17: Dislocation Geometry and Fabric Production\n2.\nnecessarily form an orthonormal set, that is the lattice vectors are not all the same\nlength and are not necessarily perpendicular to each other.\n9. Rational directions are vectors that are composed of integral numbers of lattice\nvectors. Thus, rational directions always connect one lattice point to another.\nThey are denoted by three numbers within brackets or carets, e.g. [1 5 9] or\n11 0 . The latter refers to a set of directions that are symmetrically equivalent.\nThe overscore indicates -1.\n\n12.524 2003\nLec 17: Dislocation Geometry and Fabric Production\n3.\nChoice of the origin of the lattice vectors is arbitrary, but once chosen, the lengths and\nangles between the vectors are fixed by the crystal geometry.\nLattice Coordinates\nThe symmetry of each lattice point can be represented by one of ____ space groups. The\ntranslational symmetry (i.e. the repetition structure of the lattice points) can be\ncategorized as one of seven crystal systems:\n\nTable 1.3 The crystal systems (from Kelly and Grove, 1970)\n\nSystem\nSymmetry (Minimum)\nConventional Cell\nTriclinic\nNo axes of symmetry\n;\na\nb\nc α\nβ\nγ\n=\n=\n=\n=\n\nMonoclinic\nSingle diad\n;\na\nb\nc α\nγ\nβ\n=\n=\n=\n=\n<\nD\n\nOrthorhombic\nThree ⊥diads\n;\na\nb\nc\nα\nβ\nγ\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\nD\nTrigonal (Rhombohedral)\nSingle triad\n;\na\nb\nc α\nβ\nγ\n=\n=\n=\n=\n<\nD\nHexagonal\nOne hexad\n;\na\nb\nc α\nβ\nγ\n=\n=\n=\n=\n<\nD\nCubic\nFour triads\n;\na\nb\nc α\nβ\nγ\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\nD\n\nExample I): CsCl structure: Cs is the smaller grey ion. Diagram is schematic and not\nnecessarily to scale.\n\nIf the origin is chosen as the center of the cesium ion, then the smallest lattice vectors that\ncan be chosen are equal and mutually perpendicular. The crystal system is cubic. The\ninternal coordinates of the Cl in the first choice of lattice vectors are [1⁄2 1⁄2 1⁄2]. The unit\ncell contains one stoichiometric unit, CsCl. Notice that the lattice vectors and their\ngeometry do not change if the origin is changed.\n\nExample II) Graphite mesh\nBelow is a mesh (a 2D array of lattice points). Clearly, the lattice points have hexagonal\nsymmetry and are similar to the arrangement of atoms in a sheet of graphite.\n\n12.524 2003\nLec 17: Dislocation Geometry and Fabric Production\n4.\nFirst, consider atoms, 1, 2 and 3. Are these positions equivalent allowing only\ntranslations?\nNow consider vectors a-g. Which of these vectors are lattice vectors?\nOutlined in blue is the primitive unit cell.

Lattice points: Point in a crystal with specific arrangement of atoms, reproduced\nmany times in the crystal\n2. Crystal basis: Arrangement of atoms within the unit cell.\n3. Lattice vectors connect two lattice points. There are 14 Bravais lattices included\nin seven crystal systems. (Triclinic, monoclinic, orthorhombic, tetragonal,\nrhombohedral-trigonal, hexagonal, and cubic).\n4. Any lattice point may be reached from any other by the vector addition of an\nintegral number of lattice vectors.\n5. Unit cells are made by defining a set of coordinate axes composed of three non-\ncoplanar, non-colinear lattice vectors.\n6. A primitive unit cell contains one lattice point, but may contain many atoms.\n7. The preferred unit cell is primitive, has lattice vectors as nearly equal in length as\npossible, and has an obtuse angle between two vectors, if possible. The preferred\nsetting of the lattice often, but not always, has the symmetry element of greatest\nrank parallel with the c axis. (The monoclinic and trigonal-rhombohedral lattices\nare exceptions to this rule.\n8. Non-integral combinations of the lattice vectors give the atomic positions of the\ncrystal basis.\n9. Lattice directions are specified by (integral) components of the lattice vectors.\nThey are denoted by a triple of numbers contained in brackets like < u v w > for a\nsingle direction or [u v w] for a set of symmetrically equivalent directions.\n10. Miller Bravais notation, i.e. [u v t w], is sometimes used for the hexagonal\nsystem. The third index, t, is redundant since u+v-t=0.\n\n12.524 2003\nLec 17: Dislocation Geometry and Fabric Production\n7.\nCrystal plane and Miller indices\nSummary: Lattices Planes, Crystal Forms, and Reciprocal Lattice\n1. Miller Indices arise from finding the plane intercepts, inverting, forming a vector\nand clearing fractions or common factors\n2. The Miller indices are the components of the equation for the plane.\n3. Each set of Miller indices represents a set of parallel planes. Indices that are\nintegral multiples of another set are parallel planes with a smaller interplanar\nspacing e.g. (4 4 2) and (2 2 1).\n4. In general a given direction is not parallel to the pole of a plane with the same\nMiller indices.\n5. Equivalent planes may be discovered by examining a stereogram and considering\nthe symmetry elements.\n6. Some planes in the crystal (crystal forms) are common enough or important\nenough to be given special names. The naming can be by Miller indices, classical\nterminology, by pole symmetry, or be lower case letters.\n7. Reciprocal vectors are formed by choosing a vector perpendicular to two lattice\nvectors and of reciprocal length to the third lattice vector.\n8. The lattice formed from these reciprocal vectors has lattice vectors that are in the\nsame direction as the poles to the corresponding planes. The lattice vector length\nis the reciprocal of the plane spacing."
