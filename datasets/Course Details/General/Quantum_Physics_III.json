This course is a continuation of 8.05 Quantum Physics II, and will introduce some of the important model systems studied in contemporary physics, including two-dimensional electron systems, the fine structure of hydrogen, lasers, and particle scattering.\n\nRequired Text\n\nGriffiths, David J. and Darrell F.

ISBN: 9780137127955.\n\nProblem Sets\n\nThere will be nine graded problem sets, and one ungraded problem set for the last week of class. Problem sets will be posted on the course website at least one week before they are due. Solutions will be available on the course website the day after the problem set is due. Graded problem sets will be returned in recitation,\n\nFor practical, not punitive, reasons, late homework will not be graded under any circumstances. This is especially important if you think you might want to change from listener to credit status. For conflicts that are known in advance, such as religious holidays or travel, problem sets should be turned in before the deadline. If you are away from MIT, you may submit your problem set electronically, as long as you alert theTeaching Assistant ahead of time. To allow for unforeseen circumstances such as illness or emergencies, one problem set will be dropped from the homework average, either an omitted set or the one with the lowest score. We strongly recommend that you nevertheless turn in all of the psets, and that even if you are unable to turn one in, that you work through the problems on your own anyway.\n\nProblem sets are a very important part of this class. We believe that sitting down yourself and trying to reason your way through a problem not only helps you learn the material deeply, but also develops analytical tools fundamental to a successful career in science. We recognize that students also learn a great deal from talking to and working with each other. We therefore encourage each student to make his/her own attempt on every problem and then, having done so, to discuss the problems with one another and collaborate on understanding them more fully. After you have understood the problem, it is essential for your understanding to write up the solution completely by yourself. It is a breach of academic integrity to copy any solution from another student or from previous years solutions. Your solutions should be logical, complete and legible. If you cannot present a solution clearly, it is likely that you do not understand it adequately. The graders are instructed not to give credit for unclear or illegible solutions.\n\nExams\n\nThere will be a 1.5-hour closed-book midterm exam and one three-hour final exam. [Note: Exams are not available to OCW users.]\n\nTerm Paper\n\nA highlight of this course is the term paper, which offers an opportunity to study in depth a quantum mechanical system not covered in the regular coursework. Every student will be expected to research, write and \"publish\" a short paper on a topic related to the content of Quantum Physics II or III.\n\nThe paper can explain a physical effect or further explicate ideas or problems covered in the courses. It can be based on the student's own calculations and/or library research. The paper should be written in the style and format of a brief journal article and should aim at an audience of Quantum Physics III students. Writing, editing, revising, and \"publishing\" skills are an integral part of the project, which is described in full in a separate handout.\n\nBecause this course is a CI-M (Communication Intensive in the Major) Subject, in order to pass, you must obtain a grade of C or better on your term paper. If you do not succeed in this, you will get a grade of Incomplete until you revise your term paper sufficiently to earn at least a C, and only at that time you will be assigned a final grade based on the breakdown given above.\n\nGrading\n\nactivities\n\npercentages\n\nProblem Sets\n\n25%\n\nMidterm\n\n15%\n\nTerm Paper\n\n25%\n\nFinal Exam\n\n35%\n\nThe faculty may alter grades to reflect class participation, improvement, effort, attendance, and other qualitative measures of performance.\n\nNote that this course is not graded on any predetermined curve. If the class as a whole shows exceptional mastery of quantum mechanics, the grades will be exceptionally high. Since we use absolute rather than relative standards, it is impossible for a student to lower his or her grade by helping classmates understand the material. Indeed, the process of explaining difficult concepts to a colleague can significantly help clarify and solidify one's own understanding. Typically, students perform best when they regularly attend lectures and recitations, consistently turn in quality problems sets, put in sustained effort for their term paper, and leave adequate time for exam preparation.",

Using also the fact that tr~a·~σ = 0, what can you conclude about\nthe eigenvalues of ~a·~σ? What about the eigenvalues of a0I + ~a·~σ?\n(b) Let ~a = (α, 0, β).\nWrite down the exact eigenvalues of ~a·~σ.\nWrite down the\ndominant terms and the first two correction terms in the cases when |α| ≪|β|\nand when |α| ≫|β|.

Anharmonic Oscillator (15 points)\nConsider the anharmonic oscillator with Hamiltonian\n√\npˆ\nxˆ\nH =\n+ 1 mω2 xˆ + λ 2 ~ω\n,\nd3\n2m\n~\nwhere d2 = mω and we treat ˆx term as a perturbation.\n\nQuantum Physics III (8.06) -- Spring 2018\nAssignment 1\n(a) Show that the first order shift in the ground state energy is zero. Calculate the\nshift to order λ2 .\n(b) Calculate the ground state wave function to order λ. (You may just write your\nanswer as a sum of harmonic oscillator states.)\n(c) Sketch the potential V (x) as a function of x for small λ. Is the state you found\nin (b) anything like the true ground state? What e ect has perturbation theory\nfailed to find?\n3. Perturbation of the Three-Dimensional Harmonic Oscillator (25 points)\nThe spectrum of the three-dimensional harmonic oscillator has a high degree of degen\neracy. In this problem, we see how the addition of a perturbation to the Hamiltonian\nreduces the degeneracy. This problem is posed in such a way that you can work through\nit before we even begin to discuss degenerate perturbation theory in lecture.\nConsider a quantum system described by the Hamiltonian\nH = H0 + δH\n(1)\nwhere\nH0 =\np~ + 2\n1 mω2 ~x\n(2)\n2m\nwhere ~x = (x1, x2, x3) and p~ = (p1, p2, p3). The perturbing Hamiltonian δH is given by\nδH = λωL2\n(3)\nwhere λ is a unit free constant and where L2 = x3p1 -x1p3, is the component of angular\nmomentum in the y direction.\nIn parts (a)-(e) of this problem, we study the e ects of this perturbation within the\ndegenerate subspace of states which have energy E = (5/2)~ω when λ = 0.\n(a) Set λ = 0. Thus, in this part of the problem H = H0. Define creation and\nannihilation operators for \"oscillator quanta\" in the 1, 2 and 3 directions. Define\nnumber operators N1, N2, N3. Denote eigenstates of these number operators by\ntheir eigenvalues, as |n1, n2, n3i. What is the energy of the state |n1, n2, n3i? How\nmany linearly independent states are there with energy E = (5/2)~ω? [That is,\nwhat is the degeneracy of the degenerate subspace of states we are studying?]\n(b) Express the perturbing Hamiltonian δH in terms of creation and annihilation\noperators.\n(c) What is the matrix representation of δH in the degenerate subspace you described\nin part (a)?\n(d) What are the eigenvalues and eigenstates of δH in the degenerate subspace? What\nare the eigenvalues and eigenstates of H = H0 + δH in the degenerate subspace?\n\nQuantum Physics III (8.06) -- Spring 2018\nAssignment 1\n(e) What is the matrix representation of H0 + δH in the degenerate subspace if you\nuse the eigenvectors of δH as a new basis? (i.e. instead of the original |n1, n2, n3i\nbasis.)\n[Note: As we shall see in part (f), this problem is \"too simple\" in important\nways. The aspect of this problem which will generalize when we consider more\ngeneric perturbations is that if a perturbation breaks a degeneracy, then even an\narbitrarily small but nonzero perturbation has qualitative consequences: it selects\none particular choice of energy eigenvectors, within the previously degenerate\nsubspace. In the present problem, this can be described as follows: if λ were\ninitially zero and you were happily using the |n1, n2, n3i states as your basis of\nenergy eigenstates, and then somebody \"turns on\" a very small but nonzero value\nof λ, this forces you to make a qualitative change in your basis states.\nThe\n\"rotation\" you must make from your previous energy eigenstates to the new states\nwhich are now the only possible choice of energy eigenstates is not a small one,\neven though λ is arbitrarily small.]\n(f) Suppose that |ψi and |φi are eigenstates of H0 with di erent energy eigenval\nues. That is, |ψi and |φi belong to di erent degenerate subspaces. Show that\nhφ|δH|ψi = 0 for any two such states. Relate this fact to a statement you can\nmake about the operators H0 and δH, without reference to states.\n[The fact that hφ|δH|ψi = 0 if |ψi and |φi and belong to di erent degenerate\nsubspaces means that δH is a \"non-generic\" perturbation of H0; a more general\nperturbation would not have this property.\nIt is only for perturbations with\nthis property that the analysis you have done above -- which focusses on one\ndegenerate subspace at a time -- is complete. Notice also that in order to analyze\nH = H0 + δH, we did not have to assume that λ was in any sense small. If δH\nwere \"generic\", we would have had to assume that λ was small in order to make\nprogress.]\n4. Polarizability of a Particle on a Ring; the Ethane Molecule (10 points)\nConsider a particle of mass m constrained to move in the xy-plane on a circular ring\nof radius a. The only variable of the system is the azimuthal angle, which we will call\nφ. The state of the system is described by a wave function ψ(φ) that must be periodic\nψ(φ + 2π) = ψ(φ)\nand normalized:\nZ 2π\n|ψ(φ)|2dφ = 1 .\n(a) The kinetic energy of the particle can be written:\nL2\nH0 =\nz\n(4)\n2ma2\nwhere Lz = -i~d/dφ. Calculate the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of H0. Which\nof the energy levels are degenerate?\n\nQuantum Physics III (8.06) -- Spring 2018\nAssignment 1\nFigure 1: A cartoon of an ethane molecule in its most favorable orientation, seen end on.\n(b) Now assume that the particle has a charge q and that it is placed in a uniform\nelectric field ε in the x-direction. We must therefore add to the Hamiltonian the\nperturbation\nδH = -qεa cos φ.\nCalculate the new wave function of the ground state to first order in ε. Use this\nwave function to evaluate the induced electric dipole moment in the x-direction:\nhψ|qx|ψi. Determine the proportionality constant between the dipole moment and\nthe applied field ε. This proportionality constant is called the \"polarizability\" of\nthe system.\n(c) Now turn o the electric field of part (b) and consider the ethane molecule CH3 --\nCH3. We will consider the rotation of one CH3 group relative to the other, about\nthe straight line joining the two carbon atoms, as sketched in figure 1. Here, the\nsolid circles represent the H atoms in one CH3 group, which rotate relative to the\nopen circles representing the H atoms in the other CH3 group.\nTo a zeroth approximation, this rotation is free, and the Hamiltonian H0 of (4)\ndescribes the rotational kinetic energy. (The constant 2ma2 must be replaced by\nsome new constant times the moment of inertia of a CH3 group with respect to\nthe rotational axis. However, for simplicity, we will just keep calling the constant\n2ma2.)\nWe now take the electrostatic interaction energy between the two CH3 groups\ninto account as a perturbation. To take into account the threefold symmetry, we\nadd to H0 a term of the form\nδH = b cos 3φ ,\nwhere b is a real constant. Calculate the energy and wave function of the new\nground state (to first order in b for the wave function and to second order for the\nenergy). Give a physical interpretation of the result.\n5. Energy Shift Due to Finite Nuclear Size (20 points)\nWhen you studied the hydrogen atom in 8.04/8.05, you assumed that the Coulomb\npotential extended all the way to the origin. In reality, the proton's charge is smeared\n\nQuantum Physics III (8.06) -- Spring 2018\nAssignment 1\nout over a sphere of roughly 10-13 cm in radius. This has a small e ect on the energy\nlevels of the hydrogen atom. Let's find out how small.\nYou will model the electric charge distribution of the proton as a uniformly charged\nsphere of radius R.\nYou may ignore the fine structure, Lamb shift, and hyperfine\nsplittings of hydrogen for this problem.\n(a) Find the electrostatic potential energy of the electron for all r.\n~\n[Hint: Use Gauss's law ∇~ · E = 4πρ to find the electric field everywhere and then\n~\n~\nintegrate F = -eE to obtain the potential energy.]\nYour answer should have the features that for r > R you should have V (r) =\n-e2/r and for all values of r, V (r) is continuous.\n(b) Use lowest order perturbation theory to calculate the shift in the energy of the\nground state of hydrogen due to this modification of the potential. Evaluate your\nanswer numerically, taking R = 10-13 cm, and express your answer as a fraction\nof the binding energy of the ground state (13.6 eV). [Hint: You can simplify the\nintegrals by noticing that the unperturbed wave function varies only slowly over\nthe range 0 < r < R and can thus be replaced by the value at r = 0.]\n(c) Why is this e ect most important for states with orbital angular momentum zero?\nWithout doing any calculation, make an estimate of the factor by which this e ect\nis smaller for an l = 1 state as compared to an l = 0 state.\n(d) Experimentally, the most precise measurement of the proton radius comes from\nthe PSI experiment:\nR = 0.84184(67) × 10-13 cm.\n(5)\n[R. Pohl et al., \"The size of the proton,\" Nature 466, 213 (2010).] This mea\nsurement is controversial, since it di ers by 4% from the CODATA world aver\nage (R = 0.8768(69) × 10-13 cm). Putting the controversy aside, explain why\nthe PSI experiment could get such impressive accuracy using muonic hydrogen\n(a muon-proton bound state) instead of ordinary hydrogen (an electron-proton\nbound state). [Hint: Recall that the muon has basically the same properties as\nan electron, except it is 206.8 times heavier.]\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu\n8.06 Quantum Physics III\nSpring 2018\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: https://ocw.mit.edu/terms"

Polarizability of a particle on a ring revisited (15 points)\nConsider again a particle of mass m constrained to move in the xy-plane on a circular\nring of radius a.

Otherwise consult Shankar,\np. 470, exercise 17.3.4).\n5. Stark E ect (Adapted from Griyths Problem 6.36, 30 points)\n~\nWhen an atom is placed in a uniform external electric field Eext, the energy levels are\nshifted, a phenomenon known as the Stark e ect. This is the electrical analog to\nthe magnetic Zeeman e ect. In this problem, you will analyze the Stark e ect for the\nn = 1 and n = 2 states of hydrogen. Let the electric field point in the ˆz direction, so\nthe electrostatic potential of the electron is\nδHStark = eEextz\n(7)\nTreat this as a perturbation on the Bohr Hamiltonian\n~\ne\np\nH0 =\n-\n,\n(8)\n2m\nr\nfor now ignoring spin and fine structure e ects.\n(a) [This part is just math, but will make the later calculations much easier.] Suppose\nthat a, b, c are nonnegative integers and f(r) is a function. Prove that\nZ\nb cf(r)\ndx dy dz xa y z\n= 0\n(9)\np\nunless a, b, c are each even.

In this\npart you will compute a bound on the shift.\nP\ni. Calculate\n|hα|z|1, 0, 0i|2, where α runs over all states of the Hydrogen\nα\natom, bound or unbound. [Hint: Dimensional analysis can be a good sanity\ncheck of this result.]\nii. The quantity\n(10)\nE0\n1,0,0 - E0\nα\nis always negative for all α 6\n(1, 0, 0). What is the lowest (i.e. closest to -inf)\n=\npossible value for (10)?\niii. Conclude by arguing that the second order shift\nE1\n,0,0 ≥-Ca3\n0E2\n(11)\next,\nfor some C. What is C?\nDiscussion: This calculation shows an upper bound on the ground-state po\nlarizability of the Hydrogen atom. Why? A system has polarizability α if\n~\n~\napplying field E induces dipole moment ~p = αE. A dipole ~p in an electric\n~\n~\nfield E has energy -p~ · E; thus polarizability α corresponds to energy -αE2\n~\nin an electric field with E = |E|. Conversely, if the term -αE2 appears in a\nHamiltonian, it corresponds to a system with polarizability α. Carrying out\nthe calculation of E1\n,0,0 exactly requires integrating over the unbound states,\nwhich is doable using 8.06 methods but a lot of work. This leads to the value\nCexact = 4\n9 . The value of C that you calculate should be consistent with this!\nCalculating the polarizability is a step towards calculating the van der Waals\nforce.\n(d) The first excited state of H0 is 4-fold degenerate, with |n, l, mi states |2, 0, 0i,\n|2, 1, 1i, |2, 1, 0i, |2, 1, -1i. Using degenerate perturbation theory, determine the\nfirst-order corrections to the energy. Into how many levels do these n = 2 states\nsplit? (Ignore spin.)\n(e) What are the \"good\" wave functions for part (d)? Find the expectation value of\nthe electric dipole moment (p~e ≡-e~r) in each of these \"good\" states.\n(f) Now we consider electron spin, and the fine-structure splitting between the 2S\nand 2P levels. Calculate the electric field strength (in V/cm) at which the energy\nof the Stark shift calculated above becomes equal to the fine-structure splitting\nbetween the 2S and 2P energy levels.\nA common household electric field strength is roughly 100V/cm. For example,\nthe live and neutral wires in an electrical socket have a voltage di erence of 110V\nand if they are 1.1cm apart then there will be a field of 100V/cm between them.\nIn this case, a hydrogen atom that happened to be between the two wires would\nexperience a field of strength 100V/cm. At this field strength would this atom\nbecome polarized according to your result in part (d), or would the fine-structure\nsplitting be dominant?

Application of the Semiclassical Method to the Double Well Potential (20\npoints)\nDo Griyths Problem 8.15.\nThis is not as diycult a problem as its length would indicate.\nGriyths leads you\nthrough all the steps.\nThis is an instructive problem in quantum dynamics.\nYou\nshould recall that this is the potential that we used to describe the physics of the\nammonia molecule, early in 8.05. Back then, we had to wave our hands a little when\nwe talked about tunneling splitting the degeneracy between the even and odd states.\nNow, you can do this calculation for real.\nHint for (a) and (b): The steps suggested by Griyths are: work out the wave function\nψ1 in region (i); from ψ1 use the connection formulae at x2 to obtain the wave function\nψ2 in regions (ii); use ψ2 and the connection formulae at x1 to obtain the wave function\nψ3 in region (iii). Equation (8.59) can be found by requiring that ψ3 should satisfy\nψ3(0) = 0 or ψ3\n′ (0) = 0 at x = 0.\nIt is a bit easier (and more transparent) to use a slightly di erent approach from what\nGriyths suggests. Given that the wave function should be an even or odd function of\nx, the wave function in region (iii) can be written down immediately. For example in\nthe even case,\n\nZ\nC\nx\nψ(x) = p\ncosh\ndy κ(y) ,\n-x1 < x < x1\n(2)\nκ(x)\n~\nusing our standard notations. (2) is an example where by symmetry, the exponentially\nsmall piece in a classically forbidden region is known exactly. The wave function ψ2 in\nregion (ii) then can be obtained using two ways: from ψ1 in region (i) via connection\nformulae at x2, or from ψ3 in region (iii) via connection formulae at x1. The consistency\nof two wave functions leads to equation (8.59) of Griyths.\n\nQuantum Physics III (8.06) -- Spring 2018\nAssignment 4\n6. Tunneling from perturbation theory (20 points) A key feature of tunneling is\nthat the rate is suppressed exponentially by an amount that scales with the width of\nthe barrier and the square root of the height of the barrier. We will see in this problem\nhow exponential suppression can arise from high-order degenerate perturbation theory.\nIn this problem we consider a particle localized on a line with a potential equal to zero\nat the endpoints and a potential barrier of height V0 and width W in the middle. Thus\nthe WKB transmission coeycient (or tunneling probability) for particle with energy\n√\nmuch smaller than V0 is exp(-2W 2mV0/~).\n(a) First suppose the positon of the particle is restricted to sites 0, 1, . . . , N. The\nHamiltonian consists of two terms.\nThere is a \"barrier\" term H0 which is a\npotential of height V0 on all sites except 0 and N; i.e.\nN-1\nX\nH0 = V0\n|xihx|,\n(3)\nx=1\nand a \"hopping\" term\nN\nX\nδH = -λ\n|x - 1ihx| + |xihx - 1|.\n(4)\nx=1\nAssume that λ ≪ V0.\n-λ\n-λ\n-λ\n-λ\n-λ\nbarrier\nH0\nV0\nhopping\nδH\nFigure 1: A particle is constrained to occupy one of N +1 nodes (here N = 5) with a barrier\npotential H0 from (3) and a hopping term δH from (4).\nIf there were no hopping term, there would be a two-dimensional space of zero-\nenergy degenerate ground states spanned by |0i and |Ni, or by the more useful\nlinear combinations\n|0i + |Ni\n|0i -|Ni\n|g+i =\n√\nand\n|g-i =\n√\n.\nIn the absence of hopping, the other states |1i, . . . |N - 1i are also degenerate\nwith energy V0.\nAt suyciently high order of perturbation theory the hopping term will lift the\ndegeneracy between the ground states so that: Eg+ 6\nEg- .\n=\nThe formula for the\n\nQuantum Physics III (8.06) -- Spring 2018\nAssignment 4\nkth-order correction to the energy of the |g±i states is\nX\nX δHg±,mk-1 · · · δHm2,m1 δHm1,g±\nE(k)\ng± =\n· · ·\n+ other terms.\n(5)\n(E0 - E0 ) · · · (E0 - E0\n)\ng±\nm1\ng±\nmk-1\nm1\nmk-1\nHere m1, . . . , mk-1 range over all states outside the degenerate subspace |g±i and\nwe have used the fact that a similar term does not couple |g+i to |g-i.\nWhat is the smallest value of k for which Ek - Ek is nonzero? It turns out that\ng-\ng+\nthe other terms not shown begin to contribute only for higher values of k, and\none may ignore them for the purposes of this problem.\nEvaluate the energy splitting for this value of k. Your answer should decrease\nexponentially with N, since N is analogous to W , but the scaling with V0 will not\nlook like the WKB case.\n(b) Now suppose that the discrete approximation above came from a 1-D Hamiltonian\nin which we discretized space and replaced the p2/2m with a finite di erence op\nerator. If the lattice spacing is l then the finite-di erence operator corresponding\nd2\nto\nis\ndx2\nX\nD2 =\n-2|xihx| + |xihx + 1| + |xihx - 1|.\nl\nl2\nx\nIf we ignore the diagonal part, the kinetic energy term 2\np\nm is equivalent to δH\nfrom (4). What is the corresponding value of λ?\nSuppose that the potential term is a square barrier of width W and take l = W/N\nso this corresponds to N lattice sites.\nWe see that as we reduce l the energy splitting in (a) goes down since N = W/l\nincreases as l → 0. This is an artifact of our approximation scheme since the\nphysics of the system should not depend on the \"regulator\" l that we hope to\ntake to zero. But we cannot make l arbitrarily small because λ would diverge\nand we could not keep the ratio λ/V0 small, spoiling the perturbation-theory\nargument. Let us impose the perturbation condition explicitly by setting\nλ = o ≪ 1\nV0\nwith o a fixed small constant. Verify that this means that l2V0 is kept constant\nas l → 0. Eliminate l to estimate the energy splitting as a function of o, W , V0,\nm and ~.\n(c) Part (a) and (b) have given estimates of the splitting in energies of |g±i but have\nnot directly addressed tunneling. In this part, suppose that the Hamiltonian is\nsimply\nH = E+|g+ihg+| + E-|g-ihg-|\nand define ∆ = E- - E+. Suppose that we begin at time 0 in the state |0i, and\nafter time t we measure whether the particle is in state |0i or |Ni. At what time t\nwill we find the state in position N with probability 1?

The Aharonov-Bohm E ect on Energy Eigenvalues(10 points)\nThe Aharonov-Bohm e ect modifies the energy eigenvalues of suitably chosen quantum\nmechanical systems. In this problem, we work out the example that Griyths discusses\nin 385-387.\nImagine a particle constrained to move on a circle of radius b (a bead on a wire ring,\nif you like.) Along the axis of the circle runs a solenoid of radius a < b, carrying a\nmagnetic field B = (0, 0, B0). The field inside the solenoid is uniform and the field\noutside the solenoid is zero. The setup is depicted in Griyths' Fig. 10.10.\n(a) Construct a vector potential A which describes the magnetic field (both inside\nand outside the solenoid) and which has the form Ar = Az = 0 and A° = α(r)\nfor some function α(r). We are using cylindrical coordinates z, r, φ.\n(b) Now consider the motion of a \"bead on a ring\": write the Schr odinger equation\nfor the particle constrained to move on the circle r = b, using the A you found in\n(a). [Hint: the answer is given in Griyths.]\n(c) Solve the Schrodinger equation and find the energy eigenvalues and eigenstates.\n(d) Plot the energy eigenvalues as a function of the enclosed flux . Show that the\nenergy eigenvalues are periodic functions of with period 0, where you must\ndetermine 0. For what values of does the enclosed magnetic field have no\ne ect on the spectrum of a particle on a ring? Show that the Aharonov-Bohm\ne ect can only be used to determine the fractional part of / 0.\n\nQuantum Physics III (8.06) -- Spring 2018\nAssignment 7\n(e) Suppose we introduce a defect on the ring at φ = 0, which can trap the particle,\ni.e. in addition to the states you worked out above, there now exist trapped states\nin which the wave function of the particle is localized around φ = 0. For simplicity,\nassume the trapped state wave functions vanish outside an interval (-φ0, φ0) for\nsome φ0 < π. Show that the energy of a trapped state does NOT depend on the\nexistence of the solenoid.\n[Hint: Find a gauge in which the vector potential vanishes identically in the region\nwhere the trapped state wavefunctions are supported. You should also explain\nwhy the same argument does not apply to states of part (c).]\n[Moral of problem: even though the bead on a ring is in a region in which B = 0, the\npresence of a nonzero A a ects the energy eigenvalues of states whose wave functions\ncover the whole circle. The vector potential does not a ect the energies of localized\nstates.\nThis is the counterpart for the energy spectrum of the statement that the\nBohm-Aharonov interference pattern is shifted if and only if the relevant paths enclose\nthe solenoid.]\n6. Adiabatic Spin Rotation (15 points)\nConsider a spin one-half particle at rest, with its spin free to rotate in response to a\ntime-dependent magnetic field. The Hamiltonian of the system is\n2μ0\nH = -\nS · B(t) .\n(1)\n~\nAssume μ0 > 0. We will start at time t = -T with a large magnetic field mostly in the\n-zˆ direction which we will slowly decrease to zero and then increase in the opposite\ndirection until time t = T . At the same time, we will assume that there is a constant\nsmall field in the (x, y) plane. The magnetic field is then\nB(t) = (Bx, By, γt)\nfor - T ≤ t ≤ T.\n(2)\nHere γ > 0 is the rate at which the magnetic field in the z direction grows and we\nassume that\nso that for t =\nγT ≫\nq\n±T the magnetic field is mostly along the z axis. Denote the ground\nB2 + B2\ny\nx\n,\n(3)\nstate at time t by |ψ+(t)i and the excited state at time t by |ψ-(t)i. These correspond,\nrespectively, to spins that are either aligned or anti-aligned with the magnetic field.\nSuppose that at time t = -T , the spin is in state |ψ+(-T )i.\n(a) Use the adiabatic theorem to argue that the particle initially in the state |ψ+(-T )i\nfinishes in the state |ψ+(T )i (up to an overall phase) with nearly unit probability,\nas long as |δB| ≡ p\nthe adiabatic theorem to apply.\nB2 + B2\ny\nx\n0. Find the inequality satisfied by γ needed for\n=\n(b) Explain why condition (3) implies |ψ+(-T )i ≈ |-i and |ψ+(T )i ≈|+i. In this\ncase the adiabatic process in (a) will convert the state from ≈ |-i to ≈|+i. Use\ncondition (3) and the adiabatic condition you found in part (a) to find T ≫ . . . ,\nwhere the quantity in dots does not depend on γ.\n\nQuantum Physics III (8.06) -- Spring 2018\nAssignment 7\n(c) Instead of a time-varying magnetic field, consider a spatially varying magnetic\nfield. We can use the adiabatic theorem to understand the magnetic traps used by\nMIT atomic physicists to trap very cold gases of spin-polarized atoms. Classically,\nthe force on a dipole μ from a magnetic field gradient is\nF = (μ · ∇)B(x).\n(4)\nOne can design magnetic field gradients such that an atom which has its spin\nantiparallel to the local magnetic field B(x) experiences a force toward the center\nof the trap. Those atoms with spins parallel to B(x) feel a force which expels\nthem from the trap. This way, one can trap only atoms of one polarization state.\nBut this raises a question: Since B(x) varies in space, how can we ensure that\nthe thermal movements of the atoms within the trap preserve the property that\ntheir spins are always anti-aligned with the local magnetic field?\nAssume that the atoms have mass m and temperature T .\nLet B denote the\nmagnitude of the magnetic field and |∇B| denote the magnitude of its gradient.\nState an inequality in terms of m, kB, ~, T, μ0, B, |∇B| that must be satisfied for\nthe adiabatic condition to be valid. [Hint: Since B varies in space, the thermal\nmotion of the atoms implies that the spins experience time-dependent magnetic\nfields.]\n(d) Since it is magnetic gradients which exert the trapping forces, you might think\nthat there would be no problem if at one point in the trap B = 0. In fact, this\ndoes cause problems, and the traps are designed to have B 6\n0 everywhere. Use\n=\nyour result in (c) to explain why.\n7.

      "content": "Chapter 1\nPerturbation theory\nc⃝B. Zwiebach\nIt is often the case that the Hamiltonian of a system differs slightly from a Hamiltonian\nthat is well studied and completely understood. This is a situation where perturbation the-\nory can be useful. Perturbation theory allows us to make statements about the Hamiltonian\nof the system using what we know about the well studied Hamiltonian.\nThe well studied Hamiltonian could be the that of the simple harmonic oscillator in one,\ntwo, or three dimensions. In a diatomic molecule, for example, the potential that controls\nthe vibrations is not exactly quadratic; it has extra terms that make the vibrations slightly\nanharmonic. In that situation the extra terms in the potential represent perturbations of the\nHamiltonian. The hydrogen atom Hamiltonian is also a well understood system. If we place\nthe atom inside a weak external magnetic field or electric field, the situation is described by\nadding some small terms to the hydrogen Hamiltonian. Similarly, the interaction between\nthe magnetic moments of the proton and the electron can be incorporated by modifying the\noriginal hydrogen atom Hamiltonian. The interaction between two neutral hydrogen atoms\nat a distance, leading to the van der Waals force can be studied in perturbation theory by\nthinking of the two atoms as electric dipoles.\nThe Hamiltonian of interest is written as the understood, original Hamiltonian H(0),\nplus a perturbation δH:\nH(0) + δH .\n(1.0.1)\nSince H(0) is Hermitian and the sum must be a Hermitian Hamiltonian, the perturbation\noperator δH must also be Hermitian. It is convenient to introduce a unit-free constant\nλ ∈[0, 1] and to consider, instead, a λ-dependent Hamiltonian H(λ) that takes the form\nH(λ) = H(0) + λ δH .\n(1.0.2)\nWhen λ = 1 we have the Hamiltonian of interest, but λ allows us to consider a family of\nHamiltonians that interpolate from H(0), when λ is equal to zero, to the Hamiltonian of\ninterest for λ equal to one. In many cases perturbations can be turned on and off; think,\n\nCHAPTER 1. TIME INDEPENDENT PERTURBATION THEORY\nfor example, of an atom in an external magnetic field that can be varied continuously. In\nthat case we can view λ as the parameter that allows us to turn on the perturbation by\nletting λ = 0. The parameter λ is also useful in organizing the perturbation analysis, as we\nwill see below.\nWe spoke of a Hamiltonian that differs slightly from H(0). In order to use perturbation\ntheory we need λδH to be a 'small' perturbation of the Hamiltonian H(0). We will have to\ndeal with the meaning of small. At first sight we may imagine that small means that, viewed\nas matrices, the largest entries in λδH are smaller than the largest entries in H(0). While\nthis is necessary, more is needed, as we will see in our analysis. An additional advantage of\nusing λ is that by taking it to be sufficiently small we can surely make λδH small.\nWe assume that the Hamiltonian H(0) is understood, namely, we know the eigenstates\nand eigenvalues of H(0). We want to know the eigenstates and eigenvalues of H(λ). One may\nbe able to calculate those exactly, but this is seldom a realistic possibility. Diagonalizing δH\nis seldom useful, since δH and H do not generally commute and therefore δH eigenstates are\nnot eigenstates of H(λ). In perturbation theory the key assumption is that the eigenvalues\nand eigenvectors of H(λ) can be found as series expansions in powers of λ. We hope, of\ncourse, that there are some values of λ for which the series converges, or at least gives useful\ninformation.\nFigure 1.1: The energy eigenvalues of H(λ) as λ varies from zero to one. On the λ = 0 vertical\naxis the H(0) eigenstates are represented by heavy dots. By the time λ = 1 the dots have shifted.\nIn Figure 1.1 we illustrate some of the phenomena that we may see in the spectrum\nof a system with Hamiltonian H(λ). We show how the energies of the various states may\nchange as the parameter λ is increased from zero. The two lowest energy eigenstates are\nnon-degenerate and their energies can go up and down as λ varies. Next up in energy we\nhave two degenerate states of H(0) (the Hamiltonian as λ = 0). The perturbation splits the\n\n1.1. NONDEGENERATE PERTURBATION THEORY\ntwo levels, and that happens generically. In the figure, the perturbation splits the levels to\nfirst order in λ, as shown by the different slopes of the two curves that meet at λ = 0. In\nother words, viewed as power series in λ the energies of the two states have different linear\nterms in λ. The last level shown corresponds to four degenerate states. The perturbation\nto first order in λ splits the states into a group of three states and a fourth. To second order\nin λ the three states split further. A single Hamiltonian can exhibit behavior like this, with\nmany possible variations.\nTo analyze the evolution of states and energies as functions of λ we have two possible\ncases: (i) we are following a non-degenerate state or, (ii) we are following a collection of\ndegenerate states. The challenges are quite different and therefore we must analyze them\nseparately. Clearly both situations can occur for a single Hamiltonian, depending on the\nspectrum of H(0). To follow a non-degenerate state we use non-degenerate perturbation\ntheory. To follow a set of degenerate states we use degenerate perturbation theory. Since\nHamiltonians H(0) generally have both non-degenerate and degenerate states we need to\nconsider both types of perturbation theory. We begin with non-degenerate perturbation\ntheory.\n1.1\nNondegenerate perturbation theory\nWe begin by describing the original Hamiltonian H(0). We assume this Hamiltonian has a\ndiscrete spectrum with an orthonormal basis |k(0)⟩of energy eigenstates, where k ∈Z is a\nlabel that ranges over a possibly infinite set of values:\nH(0) |k(0)⟩= E(0)\nk\n|k(0)⟩,\n⟨k(0)|l(0)⟩= δkl .\n(1.1.1)\nWe will let k = 0 denote the ground state and we order the states so that the energies\ngenerally increase as the value of the label increases, so that\nE(0)\n≤E(0)\n≤E(0)\n≤E(0)\n≤. . .\n(1.1.2)\nThe equal signs are needed because some states may be degenerate.\nIn this section we focus on a non-degenerate state |n(0)⟩with fixed n. This means that\n|n(0)⟩is a single state that is separated by some finite energy from all the states with more\nenergy and from all the states with less energy. In other words the following must be part\nof the sequence of inequalities in (1.1.2)\n. . . ≤E(0)\nn-1 < E(0)\nn\n< E(0)\nn+1 ≤. . .\n(1.1.3)\nIf the chosen state is the ground state, we have instead E(0)\n< E(0)\n1 .\nAs the perturbation is turned on by making λ different from zero, the energy eigenstate\n|n(0)⟩of H(0) will evolve into some energy eigenstate |n⟩λ of H(λ) with energy En(λ):\nH(λ)|n⟩λ = En(λ) |n⟩λ ,\n(1.1.4)\n\nCHAPTER 1. TIME INDEPENDENT PERTURBATION THEORY\nwhere\n|n⟩λ=0 = |n(0)⟩,\nand\nEn(λ = 0) = E(0)\nn .\n(1.1.5)\nAs we said, the solution is assumed to take the form of a regular power series expansion\nin λ. To make this clear consider a function f(λ) such that its derivatives to all orders exist\nfor λ = 0. In that case we have a Taylor expansion\nf(λ) =\ninf\nX\nn=0\nn!f (n)(0) λn = f(0) + f ′(0) λ + 1\n2f ′′(0) λ2 + 1\n3!f ′′′(0) λ3 + · · ·\n(1.1.6)\nThe expansion is a power series in λ, with coefficients f(0), f ′(0), etc, that are λ independent\nand reflect the value of the function and its derivatives at λ = 0.\nFor our problem we note the values of |n⟩λ and En(λ) for λ = 0 (1.1.5) and write:\n|n⟩λ = |n(0)⟩+ λ|n(1)⟩+ λ2|n(2)⟩+ λ3|n(3)⟩+ . . . ,\nEn(λ) = E(0)\nn\n+ λ E(1)\nn\n+ λ2 E(2)\nn\n+ λ3 E(3)\nn\n+ . . .\n(1.1.7)\nThe superscripts on the states and energies denote the power of λ that accompanies them\nin the above expressions. The above equations are a natural assumption; they state that\nthe perturbed states and energies, being functions of λ, admit a Taylor expansion around\nλ = 0. Our aim is to calculate the states\n|n(1)⟩,\n|n(2)⟩,\n|n(3)⟩, . . .\n(1.1.8)\nand the energies\nE(1)\nn ,\nE(2)\nn ,\nE(3)\nn ,\n. . .\n(1.1.9)\nNote that all these states and energies are, by definition, λ independent. Here |n(1)⟩is the\nleading correction to the state |n(0)⟩as we turn on λ, and E(1)\nn\nis the leading correction to\nthe energy as we turn on λ. We will not impose the requirement that |n⟩λ is normalized. It\nsuffices that |n⟩λ is normalizable, which it will be for sufficiently small perturbations. For\nλ = 1 we would find the solution for H(1) = H(0) + δH in the form\n|n⟩≡|n⟩1 = |n(0)⟩+ |n(1)⟩+ |n(2)⟩+ |n(3)⟩+ . . . ,\nEn ≡En(1) = E(0)\nn\n+ E(1)\nn\n+ E(2)\nn\n+ E(3)\nn\n+ . . .\n(1.1.10)\nSubstituting the ansatz (1.1.7) into the Schr odinger equation (1.1.4) we will find the\nconditions for such solution to exist:\nH(0) + λδH -En(λ)\n\n|n⟩λ = 0 ,\n(1.1.11)\nwhich more explicitly takes the form\n\n(H(0) -E(0)\nn ) -λ(E(1)\nn\n-δH) -λ2E(2)\nn\n-λ3E(3)\nn\n-. . . -λk E(k)\nn\n+ . . .\n\n|n(0)⟩+ λ|n(1)⟩+ λ2|n(2)⟩+ λ3|n(3)⟩+ . . . + λk|n(k)⟩+ . . .\n\n= 0 .\n(1.1.12)\n\n1.1. NONDEGENERATE PERTURBATION THEORY\nMultiplying out we get a series in λ with coefficients λ-independent vectors in the state\nspace of the theory. If this is to vanish for all values of λ those coefficients must be zero.\nCollecting the coefficients for each power of λ we\nλ0 :\n(H(0) -E(0)\nn ) |n(0)⟩= 0 ,\nλ1 :\n(H(0) -E(0)\nn ) |n(1)⟩= (E(1)\nn\n-δH)|n(0)⟩,\nλ2 :\n(H(0) -E(0)\nn ) |n(2)⟩= (E(1)\nn\n-δH)|n(1)⟩+ E(2)\nn |n(0)⟩,\nλ3 :\n(H(0) -E(0)\nn ) |n(3)⟩= (E(1)\nn\n-δH)|n(2)⟩+ E(2)\nn |n(1)⟩+ E(3)\nn |n(0)⟩,\n...\n...\n...\nλk :\n(H(0) -E(0)\nn ) |n(k)⟩= (E(1)\nn\n-δH)|n(k-1)⟩+ E(2)\nn |n(k-2)⟩+ . . . + E(k)\nn\n|n(0)⟩.\n(1.1.13)\nEach equation is the condition that the coefficient multiplying the power of λ indicated to\nthe left vanishes. That power is reflected as the sum of superscripts on each term, counting\nδH as having superscript one. This gives a simple consistency check on our equations. These\nare equations for the kets |n(1)⟩, |n(2)⟩, . . . as well as the energy corrections E(1)\nn , E(2)\nn , . . ..\nNote again that λ does not enter into the equations, and thus the kets and energy corrections\nare λ independent.\nThe first equation, corresponding to λ0, is satisfied by construction. The second equa-\ntion, corresponding to λ1, should allow us to solve for the first correction |n(1)⟩to the state\nand the first correction E(1)\nn\nto the energy.\nOnce these are known, the equation corre-\nsponding to λ2 involves only the unknowns |n(2)⟩and E(2)\nn , and should determine them. At\neach stage each equation has only two unknowns: a state correction |n(k)⟩and an energy\ncorrection E(k)\nn .\nA useful choice. We now claim that without loss of generality we can assume that all the\nstate corrections |nk⟩, with k ≥1 contain no vector along |n(0)⟩. Explicitly:\n0 = ⟨n(0)|n(1)⟩= ⟨n(0)|n(2)⟩= ⟨n(0)|n(3)⟩= . . . .\n(1.1.14)\nTo show this we explain how we can manipulate a solution that does not have this\nproperty into one that does. Suppose you have solution in which the state corrections |n(k)⟩\nhave components along |n(0)⟩:\n|n(k)⟩= |n(k)⟩′ -ak|n(0)⟩,\nk ≥1 ,\n(1.1.15)\nwith some constants ak and with |n(k)⟩′ orthogonal to |n(0)⟩. Then the solution for the full\n\nCHAPTER 1. TIME INDEPENDENT PERTURBATION THEORY\ncorrected state is\n|n⟩λ = |n(0)⟩+ λ\n|n(1)⟩′ -a1|n(0)⟩\n\n+ λ2 |n(2)⟩′ -a2|n(0)⟩\n\n+ . . .\n=\n1 -a1λ -a2λ2 -. . .\n\n|n(0)⟩+ λ|n(1)⟩′ + λ2|n(2)⟩′ + . . .\n(1.1.16)\nSince this is an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian H(λ), it will still be an eigenstate if we change\nits normalization by dividing it by any function of λ. Dividing by the coefficient of |n(0)⟩\nwe have the physically identical solution |n⟩′\nλ given by\n|n⟩′\nλ = |n(0)⟩+\n1 -a1λ -a2λ2 -. . .\n\nλ|n(1)⟩′ + λ2|n(2)⟩′ + . . .\n\n(1.1.17)\nWe can expand the denominator so that we get\n|n⟩′\nλ = |n(0)⟩+ λ|n(1)⟩′ + λ2|n(2)⟩′ + a1|n(1)⟩′\n+ . . .\n(1.1.18)\nThe explicit expressions do not matter, the key point, actually visible in (1.1.17), is that\nwe have a physically identical solution of the same equation in which the state corrections\nare all orthogonal to |n(0)⟩. This shows that we can impose the conditions (1.1.14) without\nloss of generality.\nSolving the equations. Let us finally begin solving equations (1.1.13). For this we note\nthat the Schrodinger equation for the ket |n(0)⟩implies that for the bra we have\n⟨n(0)|(H(0) -E(0)\nn ) = 0 .\n(1.1.19)\nThis means that acting with ⟨n(0)| on the left-hand side of any of the equations in (1.1.13)\nwill give zero. Consistency requires that acting with ⟨n(0)| on the right-hand side of any of\nthe equations in (1.1.13) also give zero, and presumably some interesting information. For\nthe λ-equation this gives:\n0 = ⟨n(0)|(E(1)\nn\n-δH)|n(0)⟩.\n(1.1.20)\nSince |n(0)⟩is normalized and E(1)\nn\nis a number, this means that\nE(1)\nn\n= ⟨n(0)|δH|n(0)⟩.\n(1.1.21)\nThis is the most famous result in perturbation theory: the first correction to the energy of\nan energy eigenstate is simply the expectation value of the correction to the Hamiltonian\nin the uncorrected state. You need not know the correction to the state to determine the\nfirst correction to the energy! Note that the hermicity of δH implies the required reality of\nthe energy correction.\nWe can actually find some interesting formulae (but not yet fully explicit!) for the higher\nenergy corrections. For the λ2 equation, acting with ⟨n(0)| on the right-hand side gives\n0 = ⟨n(0)|\n\n(E(1)\nn\n-δH)|n(1)⟩+ E(2)\nn |n(0)⟩\n\n.\n(1.1.22)\n\n1.1. NONDEGENERATE PERTURBATION THEORY\nRecalling our orthogonality assumption, we have ⟨n(0)|n(1)⟩= 0 and the term with E(1)\nn\ndrops out. We get\nE(2)\nn\n= ⟨n(0)|δH|n(1)⟩,\n(1.1.23)\nwhich states that the second correction to the energy is determined if we have the first\ncorrection |n(1)⟩to the state. Note that this expression is not explicit enough to make it\nmanifest that E(2)\nn\nis real. This and the earlier result for the first correction to the energy\nhave a simple generalization. Acting with ⟨n(0)| on the last equation of (1.1.13) we get\n0 = ⟨n(0)|\n\n(E(1)\nn\n-δH)|n(k-1)⟩+ E(2)\nn |n(k-2)⟩+ . . . + E(k)\nn\n|n(0)⟩\n\n.\n(1.1.24)\nUsing the orthogonality of |n(0)⟩and all the state corrections, we have\n0 = -⟨n(0)|δH)|nk-1⟩+ E(k)\nn\n,\n(1.1.25)\nand therefore we have\nE(k)\nn\n= ⟨n(0)| δH |n(k-1)⟩.\n(1.1.26)\nAt any stage of the recursive solution, the energy at a fixed order is known if the state\ncorrection is known to previous order.\nSo it is time to calculate the corrections to the\nstates!\nLet us solve for the first correction |n(1)⟩to the state. This state must be some particular\nsuperposition of the original energy eigenstates |k(0)⟩. For this we look at the equation\n(H(0) -E(0)\nn ) |n(1)⟩= (E(1)\nn\n-δH)|n(0)⟩.\n(1.1.27)\nThis is a vector equation: the left-hand side vector set equal to the right-hand side vector.\nAs in any vector equation, we can check it using a basis set of vectors. Forming the inner\nproduct of each and every basis vector with both the left-hand side and the right-hand side,\nwe must get equal numbers. We already acted on the above equation with ⟨n(0)| to figure\nout E(1)\nn . The remaining information in this equation can be obtained by acting with all\nthe states ⟨k(0)| with k = n:\n⟨k(0)|(H(0) -E(0)\nn ) |n(1)⟩= ⟨k(0)|(E(1)\nn\n-δH)|n(0)⟩.\n(1.1.28)\nOn the left-hand side we can let H(0) act on the bra. On the right-hand side we note that\nwith k = n the term with E(1)\nn\nvanishes\n(E(0)\nk\n-E(0)\nn ) ⟨k(0)| n(1)⟩= -⟨k(0)|δH|n(0)⟩.\n(1.1.29)\nTo simplify notation we define the matrix elements of δH in the original basis\nδHmn ≡⟨m(0)|δH|n(0)⟩.\n(1.1.30)\n\nCHAPTER 1. TIME INDEPENDENT PERTURBATION THEORY\nNote that the Hermiticity of δH implies that\nδHnm = (δHmn)∗.\n(1.1.31)\nWith this notation, equation (1.1.29) gives\n⟨k(0)| n(1)⟩= -\nδHkn\nE(0)\nk\n-E(0)\nn\n,\nk = n .\n(1.1.32)\nSince we now know the overlap of |n(1)⟩with all basis states, this means that the state has\nbeen determined. Indeed we can use the completeness of the basis to write\n|n(1)⟩=\nX\nk\n|k(0)⟩⟨k(0)|n(1)⟩=\nX\nk=n\n|k(0)⟩⟨k(0)|n(1)⟩,\n(1.1.33)\nsince the term with k = n does not contribute because of the orthogonality assumption.\nUsing the overlaps (1.1.32) we now get\n|n(1)⟩= -\nX\nk=n\n|k(0)⟩δHkn\nE(0)\nk\n-E(0)\nn\n.\n(1.1.34)\nThis shows that the first correction |n(1)⟩can have components along all basis states, except\n|n(0)⟩. The component along a state |k(0)⟩vanishes if the perturbation δH does not couple\n|n(0)⟩to |k(0)⟩, namely, if δHkn vanishes. Note that the assumption of non-degeneracy is\nneeded here. We are summing over all states |k(0)⟩that are not |n(0)⟩and if any such state\nhas the same H(0) energy as |n(0)⟩the energy denominator will vanish causing trouble!\nNow that we have the first order correction to the states we can compute the second\norder correction to the energy. Using (1.1.23) we have\nE(2)\nn\n= ⟨n(0)|δH|n(1)⟩= -\nX\nk=n\n⟨n(0)|δH|k(0)⟩δHkn\nE(0)\nk\n-E(0)\nn\n.\n(1.1.35)\nIn the last numerator we have ⟨n(0)|δH|k(0)⟩= δHnk = (δHkn)∗and therefore\nE(2)\nn\n= -\nX\nk=n\n|δHkn|2\nE(0)\nk\n-E(0)\nn\n.\n(1.1.36)\nThis is the second-order energy correction. This explicit formula makes the reality of E(2)\nn\nmanifest.\nIn summary, going back to (1.1.7), we have that the states and energies for H(λ) =\nH(0) + λδH are, to this order,\n|n⟩λ = |n(0)⟩-λ\nX\nk=n\nδHkn\nE(0)\nk\n-E(0)\nn\n|k(0)⟩+ O(λ2) ,\nEn(λ) = E(0)\nn\n+ λ δHnn -λ2 X\nk=n\n|δHkn|2\nE(0)\nk\n-E(0)\nn\n+ O(λ3) ,\n(1.1.37)\n\n1.1. NONDEGENERATE PERTURBATION THEORY\nRemarks:\n1. The first order corrected energy of the (non-degenerate) ground state overstates the\ntrue exact ground state energy. To see this consider the first order corrected ground\nstate energy E(0)\n+ λE(1)\n0 . Writing this in terms of expectation values, with |0(0)⟩\ndenoting the unperturbed ground state, we have\nE(0)\n+ λE(1)\n= ⟨0(0)|H(0)|0(0)⟩+ λ⟨0(0)|δH|0(0)⟩\n= ⟨0(0)|(H(0) + λδH)|0(0)⟩\n= ⟨0(0)|H(λ)|0(0)⟩.\n(1.1.38)\nBy the variational principle, the expectation value of the Hamiltonian on an arbitrary\n(normalized) state is larger than the ground state energy E0(λ), therefore\nE(0)\n+ λE(1)\n= ⟨0(0)|H(λ)|0(0)⟩≥E0(λ) ,\n(1.1.39)\nwhich is what we wanted to prove. Given this overestimate at first order, the second\norder correction to the ground state energy is always negative. Indeed,\n-λ2 X\nk=0\n|δHk0|2\nE(0)\nk\n-E(0)\n,\n(1.1.40)\nand each term is negative because the unperturbed excited state energies E(0)\nk\n(k = 0)\nexceed the unperturbed ground state energy E(0)\n.\n2. The second order correction to the energy of the |n(0)⟩eigenstate exhibits level repul-\nsion: the levels with k > n push the state down and the levels with k < n push the\nstate up. Indeed,\n-λ2 X\nk=n\n|δHkn|2\nE(0)\nk\n-E(0)\nn\n= -λ2 X\nk>n\n|δHkn|2\nE(0)\nk\n-E(0)\nn\n+ λ2 X\nk<n\n|δHkn|2\nE(0)\nn\n-E(0)\nk\n.\n(1.1.41)\nThe first term gives the negative contribution from the higher energy states and the\nsecond term gives the contribution from the lower energy states (see Figure 1.2).\nThe systematics of solving the equations is now apparent. For each equation we take\ninner products with all states in the state space. That gives the full content of the equation.\nWe first take the inner product with ⟨n(0)|, as this makes the left-hand side equal to zero\nand is thus simpler. Then we take the inner product with ⟨k(0)| with all k = n and that\ngives the remainder of the information that is contained in the equation.\nExercise 1. Calculate |n(2)⟩and E(3)\nn .\n\nCHAPTER 1. TIME INDEPENDENT PERTURBATION THEORY\nFigure 1.2: The second order corrections to the energy of the state |n(0)⟩receives negative contri-\nbutions from the higher energy states and positive contributions from the lower energy states. We\nhave, effectively, a repulsion preventing the state |n(0)⟩from approaching the neighboring states.\nExercise 2. The state |n⟩λ is not normalized. Use (1.1.37) to calculate to order λ2 the\nquantity Zn(λ) defined by\nZn(λ) ≡\nλ⟨n|n⟩λ .\n(1.1.42)\nWhat is the probability that the state |n⟩λ will be observed to be along its unperturbed\nversion |n(0)⟩?\n1.1.1\nValidity of the perturbation expansion\nWe now return to a question we did not address: What do we mean when we say that\nλδH is small? We have said that λδH must be small compared to the original Hamiltonian\nH(0), but it is not clear what this means, as both expressions are operators. For some\ninsight into this matter consider an example where H(0) is a two-by-two diagonal matrix\nwith non-degenerate eigenvalues\nH(0) =\n\nE(0)\nE(0)\n!\n.\n(1.1.43)\nThe perturbation, called λ ˆV , only has off-diagonal elements so that\nH(λ) = H(0) + λ ˆV ≡\n\nE(0)\nλV\nλV ∗\nE(0)\n!\n.\n(1.1.44)\n\n1.1. NONDEGENERATE PERTURBATION THEORY\nIn this simple example there is no need to use perturbation theory since the eigenvalues,\nE+ and E-, can be calculated exactly as functions of λ\nE±(λ) =\n2(E(0)\n+ E(0)\n2 ) ±\n2(E(0)\n-E(0)\n2 )\nv\nu\nu\nt1 +\n\"\nλ|V |\n2(E(0)\n-E(0)\n2 )\n#2\n.\n(1.1.45)\nThe perturbative expansion of the energies is obtained by Taylor expansion of the square\nFigure 1.3: The Taylor expansion of the function f(z) =\n√\n1 + z2 about z = 0 has a radius of\nconvergence equal to one.\nroot in powers of λ. To perform this expansion we need the result\nf(z) ≡\np\n1 + z2 = 1 + z2\n2 -z4\n8 + z6\n6 +\n128z8 + O(z10) .\n(1.1.46)\nThe function f(z) exhibits branch cuts at z = ±i (see Figure 1.3), thus the expansion\nof f(z) around z = 0 has radius of convergence equal to one: the series converges for |z| < 1\nand diverges for |z| > 1. Table 1 shows f(z) evaluated for z = 0.9, 1.2, and 1.5. The various\napproximations to the full series are shown.\nFor our expansion of (1.1.45), convergence for |z| < 1 implies convergence when\n|λ||V |\n2|E(0)\n-E(0)\n2 |\n< 1 =⇒|λV | < 1\n2|E(0)\n-E(0)\n2 | .\n(1.1.47)\nFor |λV | > 1\n2|E(0)\n-E(0)\n2 | the perturbation series does not converge. We learn that for\nconvergence the perturbation must be small compared with energy differences in H(0). It\nis not sufficient that the magnitude of the matrix elements of λδH be small compared to\nthose in H(0), energy differences matter. This result leads us to expect complications when\nenergy differences go to zero and H(0) has degeneracies.\n\nCHAPTER 1.

This has the effect\nof changing the original quadratic potential for a more complicated potential that includes\na quartic term. To do analysis in a clear way, we must consider units. Using the constants\nħ, m, ω of the harmonic oscillator a length scale d can be uniquely build:\nd2 =\nħ\nmω .\n(1.1.49)\nThe unit-free coordinate ˆx/d then has a simple expression in terms of creation and annihi-\nlation operators:\nˆx =\nr\nħ\n2mω (ˆa + ˆa+) = d\n√\n2(ˆa + ˆa+)\n→\nˆx\nd =\n√\n2(ˆa + ˆa+) .\n(1.1.50)\nIt follows that an ˆx4 perturbation with units of energy takes the form\nδH = ħω ˆx4\nd4\n= m2ω3\nħ\nˆx4 =\n4 ħω(ˆa + ˆa+)4 .\n(1.1.51)\nUsing the unit-free parameter λ, the perturbed Hamiltonian will therefore be\nH(λ) = H(0) + λ m2ω3\nħ\nˆx4 = H(0) + λ 1\n4 ħω(ˆa + ˆa+)4 .\n(1.1.52)\nWe will identify the states |k(0)⟩of H(0) with the number eigenstates |k⟩, k = 0, 1, . . . , of\nthe harmonic oscillator. Recall that\nE(0)\nk\n= ħω(k + 1\n2) ,\n|k⟩= (ˆa+)k\n√\nk!\n|0⟩.\n(1.1.53)\n\n1.1. NONDEGENERATE PERTURBATION THEORY\nThe Hamiltonian H(λ) defines an anharmonic oscillator. In a classical anharmonic oscil-\nlator the frequency of oscillation depends on the amplitude of oscillation. In the quantum\nharmonic oscillator all levels are equally spaced. The frequencies associated with transi-\ntions between various levels are therefore integer multiples (i.e. harmonics) of the basic\nfrequency associated to a transition between the first excited state and the ground state.\nIn the quantum anharmonic oscillator the spacing between the energy levels is not uniform.\nFirst the simplest question: What is the first-order correction E(1)\nto the energy of the\nground state? For this, following (1.1.21) we simply calculate the expectation value of the\nperturbation on the ground state:\nE(1)\n= ⟨0|1\n4 ħω(ˆa + ˆa+)4|0⟩=\n4 ħω⟨0|(ˆa + ˆa+)4|0⟩= 3\n4 ħω ,\n(1.1.54)\nwhere we used\n⟨0|(ˆa + ˆa+)4|0⟩= 3 ,\n(1.1.55)\nas you should verify. It follows that the corrected energy is\nE0(λ) = E(0)\n+ λE(1)\n+ O(λ2) = 1\n2ħω + λ 3\n4ħω + O(λ2) = 1\n2ħω\n1 + 3\n2λ + O(λ2)\n\n(1.1.56)\nWe note that the energy of the ground state increases with λ > 0. This is reasonable as the\nquartic term in the modified potential squeezes the ground state. How about second order\ncorrection to the ground state energy? For this we use (1.1.36) taking n = 0:\nE(2)\n= -\nX\nk=0\n|δHk0|2\nE(0)\nk\n-E(0)\n.\n(1.1.57)\nThe sum is over all k ≥1 such that δHk0 is non-vanishing. Here\nδHk0 =\n4ħω ⟨k|(ˆa + ˆa+)4|0⟩.\n(1.1.58)\nWe consider (ˆa + ˆa+)4|0⟩which corresponds, up to constants to acting on the ground state\nwavefunction φ0 with x4. This should give an even wavefunction. So (ˆa + ˆa+)4|0⟩must\nbe a superposition of |0⟩, |2⟩, and |4⟩. We cannot get states with higher number because\nthere are at most four creation operators acting on the vacuum. A short calculation (do\nit!) confirms that\n(ˆa + ˆa+)4|0⟩= 3|0⟩+ 6\n√\n2 |2⟩+\n√\n4! |4⟩.\n(1.1.59)\nThis immediately gives\nδH00 = 3\n4 ħω ,\nδH20 = 3\n√\nħω ,\nδH40 =\n√\n2 ħω ,\n(1.1.60)\nthe first of which we had already determined and is not needed for the second order com-\nputation. Back in (1.1.57) we have\nE(2)\n= -|δH20|2\n2ħω\n-|δH40|2\n4ħω\n= -(ħω)2\n2ħω\n2 -(ħω)2\n4ħω\n2 = -\n4 + 3\n\nħω = -21\n8 ħω .\n(1.1.61)\n\nCHAPTER 1.

They find that1\nE0(λ) = 1\n2ħω\n1 + 3\n2λ -21\n4 λ2 + 333\n8 λ3 -30885\nλ4 + 916731\nλ5 -65518401\nλ6 + O(λ7)\n\n(1.1.63)\nAs it turns out the coefficients keep growing and the series does not converge for any nonzero\nλ; the radius of convergence is actually zero! This does not mean the series is not useful.\nIt is an asymptotic expansion. This means that for a given small value of λ the magnitude\nof successive terms generally decrease until, at some point, they start growing again. A\ngood approximation to the desired answer is obtained by including only the part of the sum\nwhere the terms are decreasing.\nExercise 3. Calculate the first order correction E(1)\nn\nto the energy for the state |n⟩of\nnumber n. Exhibit the anharmonicity of the oscillator by using this result to find, to first\norder in λ, the energy separation ∆En(λ) = En(λ) -En-1(λ) between levels.\nLet us now find the first order correction to the ground-state wavefunction.\nUsing\n(1.1.34) with n = 0 we have\n|0(1)⟩= -\nX\nk=0\nδHk0\nE(0)\nk\n-E(0)\n|k⟩.\n(1.1.64)\nWe then find\n|0(1)⟩= -δH20\n2ħω |2⟩-δH40\n4ħω |4⟩= -3\n√\n2|2⟩-1\n√\n4!|4⟩\n= -3\n4 ˆa+ˆa+|0⟩-1\n16 ˆa+ˆa+ˆa+ˆa+|0⟩.\n(1.1.65)\nThis means that to first order the ground state of the perturbed oscillator is\n|0⟩λ = |0⟩-λ\n\n4 ˆa+ˆa+|0⟩+ 1\n16 ˆa+ˆa+ˆa+ˆa+|0⟩\n\n+ O(λ2) .\n(1.1.66)\n1.2\nDegenerate perturbation theory\nIf the spectrum of H(0) has degenerate states, as shown in Figure 1.1, tracking the evolution\nof those states as λ becomes nonzero presents new challenges. We first show that naive\nextrapolation of our results for a non-degenerate state do not work. We will also be able to\nappreciate the basic difficulty.\n1Bender and Wu's results, in eqns. (2.12) of their paper must all be multiplied by a factor of 2, as they\ntake A0 = 1/2.\n\n1.2.

The unperturbed matrix H(0) will be set\nequal to the identity matrix:\nH(0) =\n\n.\n(1.2.1)\nWe have a degeneracy here as the two eigenvalues are identical (and equal to one). The\nperturbation matrix δH is chosen to be offdiagonal:\nδH =\n\n.\n(1.2.2)\nWe then have\nH(λ) = H(0) + λδH =\nλ\nλ\n\n.\n(1.2.3)\nUsing labels n = 1, 2 the unperturbed eigenstates can be taken to be\n|1(0)⟩=\n\n,\n|2(0)⟩=\n\n,\nE(0)\n= E(0)\n= 1 ,\n(1.2.4)\nwith the corresponding eigenvalues indicated as well. To first order in λ, the eigenvalues\npredicted from non-degenerate perturbation theory (1.1.37) are En(λ) = E(0)\nn\n+ λδHnn.\nThis gives\nE1(λ) = E(0)\n+ λδH11 = 1 + λ · 0 = 1 ?\nE1(λ) = E(0)\n+ λδH22 = 1 + λ · 0 = 1 ?\n(1.2.5)\nThe eigenvalues are unperturbed to first order in λ since the matrix δH is off-diagonal.\nThese answers, however, are wrong. We can compute the exact eigenvalues of H(λ) and\nthey are 1 ± λ. There is also a problem with the state corrections. Equation (1.1.37) states\nthat\n|n⟩λ = |n(0)⟩-λ\nX\nk=n\nδHkn\nE(0)\nk\n-E(0)\nn\n|k(0)⟩.\n(1.2.6)\nbut this time, with E(0)\n= E(0)\nthe denominator is zero, and the δH matrix element is also\nzero, giving us an ambiguous result.\nSo what can we do? A direct calculation shows that\nH(λ) has eigenvectors\n√\n\nwith eigenvalue = 1 + λ ,\n(1.2.7)\nand\n√\n-1\n\nwith eigenvalue = 1 -λ .\n(1.2.8)\nYou may think the eigenvectors jump from those of H(0) indicated in (1.2.4) to those of\nH(λ) as soon as λ becomes nonzero.\nSuch discontinuity is totally against the spirit of\n\nCHAPTER 1. TIME INDEPENDENT PERTURBATION THEORY\nperturbation theory. Happily, this is not really true. The eigenvectors of H(0) are in fact\nambiguous, precisely due to the degeneracy. The eigenvectors of H(0) are actually the span\nof the two vectors listed in (1.2.4).\nThe perturbation selected a particular combination\nof these eigenvectors. This particular combination is the one that we should use even for\nλ = 0. The lesson is that to get states that vary continuously as λ is turned on we must\nchoose the basis in the degenerate subspace of H(0) carefully. We will call that carefully\nselected basis the \"good\" basis.\n1.2.2\nSystematic Analysis\nAgain, we are looking at the perturbed Hamiltonian\nH(λ) = H(0) + λδH ,\n(1.2.9)\nwhere H(0) has known eigenvectors and eigenvalues. We will focus this time on a degenerate\nsubspace of eigenvectors of dimension N > 1, that is, a space with N linearly independent\neigenstates of the same energy. In the basis of eigenstates, H(0) is a diagonal matrix that\ncontains a string of N > 1 identical entries:\nH(0) = diag { E(0)\n1 , E(0)\n2 , . . . , E(0)\nn , . . . , E(0)\nn\n|\n{z\n}\nN\n, . . . } .\n(1.2.10)\nIn the degenerate subspace we choose a collection of N orthonormal eigenstates\n|n(0); 1⟩, |n(0); 2⟩, . . . , |n(0); N⟩.\n(1.2.11)\nAccordingly, we have\n⟨n(0); p |n(0); l⟩= δp,l ,\n(1.2.12)\nH(0)|n(0); k⟩= E(0)\nn |n(0); k⟩.\n(1.2.13)\nThis set of vectors span a degenerate subspace of dimension N that we will call VN\nVN ≡span{|n(0); k⟩, k = 1, . . . N} .\n(1.2.14)\nThe total state space of the theory, denoted by H is written as a direct sum:\nH = VN ⊕ˆV ,\n(1.2.15)\nwhere ˆV is spanned by those eigenstates of H(0) that are not in VN. We denote by |p(0)⟩\nwith p ∈Z a basis for ˆV . That basis may include both degenerate and non degenerate\nstates. Together with the states in VN we have an orthonormal basis for the whole state\nspace:\n⟨p(0)|q(0)⟩= δpq ,\n⟨p(0)|n(0); k⟩= 0 .\n(1.2.16)\n\n1.2. DEGENERATE PERTURBATION THEORY\nOur notation distinguishes the states in VN from those in ˆV because the former have two\nlabels and the latter have only one.\nWe now consider the evolution of the degenerate eigenstates as we turn on the pertur-\nbation. Again we assume that the states vary continuously in λ and thus write:\n|n(0); k⟩→\n|n; k⟩λ = |n(0); k⟩+ λ|n(1); k⟩+ λ2|n(2); k⟩+ O(λ3) ,\nE(0)\nn\n→\nEn,k(λ) = E(0)\nn\n+ λ E(1)\nn,k + λ2 E(2)\nn,k + O(λ3) .\n(1.2.17)\nThese equations hold for k = 1, . . . , N. Note that for each value of k the energy corrections\nmight be different and that's why the energy corrections carry the label k. Our goal is to\nfind the state corrections |n(p); k⟩and the energy corrections E(p)\nn,k for p ≥1 and for each k.\nAs before we demand that |n(p); k⟩for p ≥1 has no component along |n(0); k⟩, i.e.\n⟨n(0); k|n(p); k⟩= 0\nfor p ≥1\n(1.2.18)\nNote, however, that |n(p); k⟩may have components along |n(0); l⟩with l= k. So |n(0); k⟩\nmay and in fact will have a component in VN.\nThe perturbed eigenstates must satisfy\nH(λ) |n; k⟩λ = En,k(λ) |n; k⟩λ ,\n(1.2.19)\nand substituting the perturbative expansions above we obtain equations completely analo-\ngous to the ones in Eq.(1.1.13)\nλ0 :\n(H0 -E(0)\nn ) |n(0); k⟩= 0 ,\n(1.2.20)\nλ1 :\n(H0 -E(0)\nn ) |n(1); k⟩= (E(1)\nn,k -δH)|n(0); k⟩,\n(1.2.21)\nλ2 :\n(H0 -E(0)\nn ) |n(2); k⟩= (E(1)\nn,k -δH)|n(1); k⟩+ E(2)\nn,k |n(0); k⟩,\n(1.2.22)\n...\n...\n...\nIn the following we will discuss a solution to first order for the case in which the de-\ngeneracy in VN is completely broken to first order in perturbation theory; that is, the first\norder corrections to the energies split the N states completely. Our solution will proceed\nin three steps:\n1. Hit the O(λ) equation with ⟨n(0); l| to learn that δH must be diagonal in the chosen\nbasis for VN and to determine the first-order energy shifts.\n2. Use the O(λ) equation to calculate the components of |n(1); k⟩in ˆV .\n3. Hit the O(λ2) equation with ⟨n(0); l| to determine the second order energy correction\nE(2)\nn,k and the component of |n(1); k⟩in VN.\n\nCHAPTER 1. TIME INDEPENDENT PERTURBATION THEORY\nStep 1. Recalling that ⟨n(0); l|(H(0) -E(0)\nn ) = 0, as we hit the O(λ) equation with ⟨n(0); l|\nthe left-hand side vanishes and we find\n⟨n(0); l|(E(1)\nn,k -δH)|n(0); k⟩= 0 .\n(1.2.23)\nSince the basis states in VN are orthonormal, this implies that\n⟨n(0); l| δH |n(0); k⟩= E(1)\nn,k δl,k .\n(1.2.24)\nThis equation holds for all k, l= 1, . . . , N. Remarkably, this equation is telling us that the\nbasis |n(0); k⟩must be chosen to make the matrix δH diagonal in the subspace VN! This\nis required in order to get the perturbation theory going. Setting lequal to k we read the\nvalues of the first order energy shifts\nE(1)\nn,k = ⟨n(0); k|δH|n(0); k⟩= δHnk,nk ,\n(1.2.25)\nwhere the last equality is a definition. The energies to first order are then\nEn,k(λ) = E(0)\nn\n+ λ δHnk,nk .\n(1.2.26)\nA few remarks:\n1. The above result for the first order energy shifts is true always, even if the degeneracy\nis not lifted. The degeneracy is lifted when\nE(1)\nn,k = E(1)\nn,l,\nwhenever k = l,\n(1.2.27)\nfor all values of k, l= 1, . . . , N. This assumption will be used in the later steps. If\nthe degeneracy is lifted, the basis states |n(0); k⟩that make δH diagonal in VN are\ncalled \"good states\" or a \"good basis\". This means that they are the basis states in\nVN that get deformed continuously as λ becomes non-zero. If the degeneracy is not\nlifted to first order the determination of the good basis has to be attempted to second\norder.\n2. The perturbation δH is diagonalized in the subspace VN. The perturbation δH is\nnot diagonal on the whole space H, only within the block representing VN is δH a\ndiagonal matrix. Alternatively we can see this via the action of δH on the basis states.\nIntroducing a resolution of the identity, we have\nδH|n(0); l⟩=\nX\nq\n|n(0); q⟩⟨n(0); q|δH|n(0); l⟩+\nX\np\n|p(0)⟩⟨p(0)|δH|n(0); l⟩\n=\nX\nq\nE(1)\nn,lδl,q|n(0); q⟩+\nX\np\n|p(0)⟩⟨p(0)|δH|n(0); l⟩\n= E(1)\nn,l|n(0); l⟩+\nX\np\n|p(0)⟩⟨p(0)|δH|n(0); l⟩.\n(1.2.28)\nThis shows that the states |n(0); l⟩are almost δH eigenstates with eigenvalues equal\nto the first order energy corrections. The failure is an extra state along ˆV .\n\n1.2. DEGENERATE PERTURBATION THEORY\n3. We can sometimes assess without computation that a certain basis in VN makes δH\ndiagonal. Here is a rule: the matrix δH is diagonal for a choice of basis in VN if there\nis a Hermitian operator K that commutes with δH for which the chosen basis vectors\nare K eigenstates with different eigenvalues. This is quickly established. Consider\ntwo different basis states in VN: |n(0); p⟩and |n(0); q⟩, with p = q. Assume these have\nK eigenvalues λp and λq, respectively. Since [δH, K] = 0:\n0 = ⟨n(0); p|[δH, K]|n(0); q⟩= (λq -λp)⟨n(0); p| δH |n(0); q⟩.\n(1.2.29)\nSince the eigenvalues λp and λq are presumed to be different, the non-diagonal matrix\nelements of δH vanish.\nStep 2. The O(λ) equation cannot determine the component of |n(1); k⟩along VN. As\nwe will see later, such piece is required by consistency and gets determined from the O(λ2)\nequation. We now determine the piece of |n(1); k⟩along ˆV . For this we hit the O(λ) equation\nwith ⟨p(0)| to find\n⟨p(0)|(H(0) -E(0)\nn )|n(1); k⟩= ⟨p(0)| (\n|p(0)⟩⊥VN\nE(1)\nn,k -δH ) |n(0); k⟩\n(1.2.30)\nand we get\n(E(0)\np\n-E(0)\nn )⟨p(0)|n(1); k⟩= -δHp,nk ,\n(1.2.31)\nwhere we introduced the matrix element δHp,nk ≡⟨p(0)| δH |n(0); k⟩. Our equation above\nmeans that the piece of |n(1); k⟩in ˆV is now determined:\n|n(1); k⟩= -\nX\np\nδHp,nk\nE(0)\np\n-E(0)\nn\n|p(0)⟩+ |n(1); k⟩\n\nVN\n,\n(1.2.32)\nwhere we included explicitly the still undetermined piece of |n(1); k⟩along VN.\nStep 3. We now hit we hit the O(λ2) equation with ⟨n(0); l|. The left-hand side vanishes\nand using the above expression for |n(1); k⟩we find\n0 =\n-⟨n(0); l|(E(1)\nn,k -δH)\nX\np\n|p(0)⟩\nδHp,nk\nE(0)\np\n-E(0)\nn\n+ ⟨n(0); l|(E(1)\nn,k -δH)|n(1); k⟩\n\nVN\n+E(2)\nn,kδk,l.\n(1.2.33)\nIn the first term on the right-hand side, the part proportional to E(1)\nn,k vanishes by orthonor-\nmality. On the second line, the term including δH can be simplified because δH is diagonal\nwithin VN. Recalling (1.2.28) we have\n⟨n(0); l|δH = E(1)\nn,l⟨n(0); l| +\nX\np\n⟨n(0); l|δH|p(0)⟩⟨p(0)| .\n(1.2.34)\n\nCHAPTER 1. TIME INDEPENDENT PERTURBATION THEORY\nThe piece in ˆV vector drops out for our case of interest:\n⟨n(0); l|δH|n(1); k⟩\n\nVN\n= E(1)\nn,l⟨n(0); l|n(1); k⟩\n\nVN\n.\n(1.2.35)\nBack into equation (1.2.33) we now get\nX\np\nδHnl,pδHp,nk\nE(0)\np\n-E(0)\nn\n+\n\nE(1)\nn,k -E(1)\nn,l\n\n⟨n(0); l|n(1); k⟩\n\nVN\n+ E(2)\nn,kδk,l= 0 .\n(1.2.36)\nSetting l= k we can determine the second correction to the energies:\nE(2)\nn,k = -\nX\np\n|δHp,nk|2\nE(0)\np\n-E(0)\nn\n.\n(1.2.37)\nFor k = lwe get\nX\np\nδHnl,pδHp,nk\nE(0)\np\n-E(0)\nn\n+\n\nE(1)\nn,k -E(1)\nn,l\n\n⟨n(0); l|n(1); k⟩\n\nVN\n= 0 .\n(1.2.38)\nHad we not included the piece of |n(1); k⟩along the degenerate subspace we would have\nhad an inconsistency, since there is no reason why the first term on the left-hand side must\nbe zero. Now the above equation just fixes the components of |n(1); k⟩in the degenerate\nsubspace as long as E(1)\nn,k = E(1)\nn,l:\n⟨n(0); l|n(1); k⟩\n\nVN\n= -\nE(1)\nn,k -E(1)\nn,l\nX\np\nδHnl,pδHp,nk\nE(0)\np\n-E(0)\nn\n,\nk = l.\n(1.2.39)\nWe thus have\n|n(1); k⟩\n\nVN\n= -\nX\nl=k\n|n(0); l⟩\nE(1)\nn,k -E(1)\nn,l\nX\np\nδHnl,pδHp,nk\nE(0)\np\n-E(0)\nn\n.\n(1.2.40)\nIt may seem that this extra piece, found by using the O(λ2) equation, is higher order than\nit should in the perturbation: its numerator contains two powers of δH. But this expression\nalso has a curious energy denominator, E(1)\nn,k -E(1)\nn,l, in which each term has a power of δH.\nAll in all, the correction to the state is properly first order in δH.\nSummarizing our result we have\nDegenerate perturbation theory with degeneracies lifted at O(λ):\n|n; k⟩λ = |n(0); k⟩-λ\nX\np\nδHp,nk\nE(0)\np\n-E(0)\nn\n|p(0)⟩+\nX\nl=k\n|n(0); l⟩\nE(1)\nn,k -E(1)\nn,l\nX\np\nδHnl,pδHp,nk\nE(0)\np\n-E(0)\nn\n\n+ O(λ2)\nEn,k(λ) = E(0)\nn\n+ λ δHnk,nk -λ2 X\np\nδHnk,p δHp,nk\nE(0)\np\n-E(0)\nn\n+ O(λ3) ,\nE(1)\nn,k = δHnk,nk .\n(1.2.41)\n\n1.2. DEGENERATE PERTURBATION THEORY\n1.2.3\nDegeneracy lifted at second order\nWe now investigate the case when the degeneracy is completely unbroken to first order.\nThe situation and the setup is similar to the one we just considered: we have a degenerate\nsubspace VN of dimension N and the rest of the space is called ˆV . This time, however, we\nwill assume that the degeneracy of H(0) is not broken to first order in the perturbation δH.\nConcretely, this means that on the VN basis |n(0); k⟩with k = 1, . . . , N, we have\n⟨n(0); l| δH |n(0); k⟩= E(1)\nn δl,k .\n(1.2.42)\nThe first order energy correction is the same, and equal to E(1)\nn , for all basis states in VN.\nYou should compare with (1.2.24), where the energy had an extra subscript to distinguish\nits various possible values.\nBecause the degeneracy is not broken to first order we do not know at this point what\nis the good basis in VN. We will consider here the case when the degeneracy is completely\nlifted to second order. We express our ignorance about good basis vectors by stating that\nwe are searching for the right linear combinations:\n|ψ(0)⟩=\nN\nX\nk=1\n|n(0); k⟩a(0)\nk\n.\n(1.2.43)\nFor some values of the constants a(0)\nk\nwith k = 1, . . . , N the state |ψ(0)⟩will be good. We\ncan think of a(0) as the column vector representation of |ψ(0)⟩in VN. We have written\njust one state, |ψ(0)⟩, even though we are expecting to find N good states to span the\ndegenerate subspace. We therefore adjust the notation to reflect this. We introduce a new\nindex I = 1, . . . , N and write\n|ψ(0)\nI ⟩=\nN\nX\nk=1\n|n(0); k⟩a(0)\nIk ,\nI = 1, . . . , N .\n(1.2.44)\nThe index I now labels the different good states and their different vector representations\na(0)\nI . Our most immediate goal is to find those vectors a(0)\nI\nand thus the good basis. To\ndo so we will have to consider second order energy corrections. The states |ψ(0)\nI ⟩form an\northonormal basis in VN if the coefficients a(0)\nI\nsatisfy\n⟨ψ(0)\nJ |ψ(0)\nI ⟩= δIJ\n→\nX\nk\n(a(0)\nJk)∗a(0)\nIk\n= δIJ .\n(1.2.45)\nWe set up the perturbation theory as usual\n|ψI⟩λ = |ψ(0)\nI ⟩+ λ|ψ(1)\nI ⟩+ λ2|ψ(2)\nI ⟩+ . . . ,\nEnI(λ) = E(0)\nn\n+ λ E(1)\nn\n+ λ2 E(2)\nnI\n+ λ3 E(3)\nnI + . . . .\n(1.2.46)\n\nCHAPTER 1. TIME INDEPENDENT PERTURBATION THEORY\nNote that in the energy expansion we have accounted for the degeneracy to zeroth and first\norder: the index I first appears in the second-order corrections to the energy. Using the\nSchr odinger equation\nH(λ)|ψI⟩λ = EnI(λ)|ψI⟩λ ,\n(1.2.47)\ngives the by now familiar equations, of which we list the first four:\nλ0 :\n(H(0) -E(0)\nn ) |ψ(0)\nI ⟩= 0 ,\nλ1 :\n(H(0) -E(0)\nn ) |ψ(1)\nI ⟩= (E(1)\nn\n-δH)|ψ(0)\nI ⟩,\nλ2 :\n(H(0) -E(0)\nn ) |ψ(2)\nI ⟩= (E(1)\nn\n-δH)|ψ(1)\nI ⟩+ E(2)\nnI |ψ(0)\nI ⟩,\nλ3 :\n(H(0) -E(0)\nn ) |ψ(3)\nI ⟩= (E(1)\nn\n-δH)|ψ(2)\nI ⟩+ E(2)\nnI |ψ(1)\nI ⟩+ E(3)\nnI |ψ(0)\nI ⟩.\n(1.2.48)\nThe zero-th order equation is trivially satisfied. For the order λ equation the overlap with\n⟨n(0); l| works out automatically, without giving any new information. Indeed, the left-hand\nside vanishes and we thus get\n0 = ⟨n(0); l|(E(1)\nn\n-δH)|ψ(0)\nI ⟩.\n(1.2.49)\nSince ⟨n(0); l| is a δH eigenstate with eigenvalue E(1)\nn , up to a vector in ˆV (see (1.2.34)),\nthe above right-hand side vanishes. Acting on the order λ equation with ⟨p(0)| gives useful\ninformation:\n(E(0)\np\n-E(0)\nn )⟨p(0)|ψ(1)\nI ⟩= ⟨p(0)|(E(1)\nn\n-δH)|ψ(0)\nI ⟩= -⟨p(0)|δH|ψ(0)\nI ⟩,\n(1.2.50)\nusing the orthogonality of ˆV and VN. Letting\nδHpI ≡⟨p(0)|δH|ψ(0)\nI ⟩,\n(1.2.51)\nwe then have\n⟨p(0)|ψ(1)\nI ⟩= -\nδHpI\nE(0)\np\n-E(0)\nn\n.\n(1.2.52)\nSince the ket |ψ(0)\nI ⟩is still undetermined, it makes sense to write this information about\n|ψ(1)\nI ⟩in terms of the unknown a(0)\nI\ncoefficients. We have\nδHpI ≡\nN\nX\nk=1\n⟨p(0)|δH|n(0); k⟩a(0)\nIk =\nN\nX\nk=1\nδHp,nk a(0)\nIk ,\n(1.2.53)\nBack into (1.2.52) we get\n⟨p(0)|ψ(1)\nI ⟩= -\nE(0)\np\n-E(0)\nn\nN\nX\nk=1\nδHp,nk a(0)\nIk .\n(1.2.54)\n\n1.2. DEGENERATE PERTURBATION THEORY\nThis gives the piece of |ψ(1)\nI ⟩in ˆV in terms of the unknown zeroth order eigenstates.\nWe have now extracted all the information from the order λ equation. We look now\nat the order λ2 equation, which contains the second order corrections to the energy and\ntherefore should help us determine the zeroth order good states. We hit that equation with\n⟨n(0); l| and we get\n0 = ⟨n(0); l|(E(1)\nn\n-δH)|ψ(1)\nI ⟩\nˆV +⟨n(0); l|(E(1)\nn\n-δH)|ψ(1)\nI ⟩\n\nVN\n+ E(2)\nnI a(0)\nIl.\n(1.2.55)\nHappily, the second term, involving the components of |ψ(1)\nI ⟩along VN, vanishes because\nof the by now familiar property (1.2.28) adapted to this case. The piece with E(1)\nn\non the\nfirst term also vanishes. We are thus left with\n0 = -⟨n(0); l|δH|ψ(1)\nI ⟩\nˆV + E(2)\nnI a(0)\nIl.\n(1.2.56)\nIntroducing a resolution of the identity to the immediate right of δH, only the basis states\nin ˆV contribute and we get\n0 = -\nX\np\n⟨n(0); l|δH|p(0)⟩⟨p(0)|ψ(1)\nI ⟩+ E(2)\nnI a(0)\nIl,\n(1.2.57)\nwhere there is no need to copy the | ˆV anymore. Using the result in (1.2.54) we now get\n0 =\nX\np\nδHnl,p\nE(0)\np\n-E(0)\nn\nN\nX\nk=1\nδHp,nk a(0)\nIk +\nN\nX\nk=1\nE(2)\nnI δlka(0)\nIk\n(1.2.58)\nReordering sums and multiplying by minus one we get\nN\nX\nk=1\n\n-\nX\np\nδHnl,pδHp,nk\nE(0)\np\n-E(0)\nn\n-E(2)\nnI δlk\n!\na(0)\nIk\n= 0 .\n(1.2.59)\nTo understand better this equation we define the N × N Hermitian matrix M(2)\nM(2)\nl,k\n≡-\nX\np\nδHnl,p δHp,nk\nE(0)\np\n-E(0)\nn\n.\n(1.2.60)\nThe equation then becomes\nN\nX\nk=1\n\nM(2)\nl,k -E(2)\nnI δlk\n\na(0)\nIk\n= 0 .\n(1.2.61)\nRecalling that the Kronecker delta is the matrix representation of the identity, we have\n\nM(2) -E(2)\nnI 1\n\na(0)\nI\n= 0 .\n(1.2.62)\n\nCHAPTER 1. TIME INDEPENDENT PERTURBATION THEORY\nThis is an eigenvalue equation that tells us that the energy corrections E(2)\nnI are the eigen-\nvalues of M(2) and the vectors a(0)\nI\nare the associated normalized eigenvectors.\nThese\ndetermine, via (1.2.44), our orthonormal basis of good zeroth order states. If δH is known,\nthe matrix M(2) is computable and Hermitian and can therefore be diagonalized.\nWe will leave the computation of the component of |ψ(1)\nI ⟩on the degenerate subspace.\nThat can be done if the degeneracy is completely broken to quadratic order (the eigenvalues\nof M(2) are all different). Still, it takes some effort and one must use the order λ3 equation.\nOur results so far are\n|ψI⟩λ = |ψ(0)\nI ⟩+ λ\nX\np\n|p(0)⟩\nδHpI\nE(0)\nn\n-E(0)\np\n+\nX\nJ=I\n|ψ(0)\nJ ⟩a(1)\nI,J\n\n+ O(λ2) ,\nEIn(λ) =\nE(0)\nn\n+ λ E(1)\nn\n+ λ2 E(2)\nIn + λ3 E(3)\nIn + . . .

If you followed the discussion, all other\nsymbols in the above equations have been defined and are computable given δH.\nThe answer for the coefficients a(1)\nI,J turns out to be\na(1)\nI,J =\nE(2)\nnI -E(2)\nnJ\n\"X\np,q\nδHJp δHpq δHqI\n(E(0)\np\n-E(0)\nn )(E(0)\nq\n-E(0)\nn )\n-E(1)\nn\nX\np\nδHJp δHpI\nE(0)\np\n-E(0)\nn\n#\n.

You have found the bound state\nspectrum in more than one way and learned about the large degeneracy that exists for all\nstates except the ground state. We will call the hydrogen atom Hamiltonian H(0) and it is\ngiven by\nH(0) = p2\n2m -e2\nr .\n(2.1.1)\nWe take this to be the \"known\" Hamiltonian, meaning that we know its spectrum. This\nHamiltonian is supplemented with corrections that can be studied in perturbation theory.\nThat study is the subject of this chapter.\nWe begin, however, with some review and\ncomments.\nThe mass m in H(0) is the reduced mass of the electron and proton, which we can\naccurately set equal to the mass of the electron. If one wishes to consider the case of an an\nelectron bound to a nucleus with Z protons one lets e2 →Ze2 in H(0). The Bohr radius is\nthe length scale build from ħ, m, and e2\na0 ≡ħ2\nme2 ∼53 pm.\n(2.1.2)\nThe energy levels are enumerated using a principal quantum number n, an integer that\nmust be greater or equal to one:\nEn = -e2\n2a0\nn2 ,\nn = 1, 2, . . . .\n(2.1.3)\nNote that H(0) is a non-relativistic Hamiltonian: the speed of light does not enter in it,\nand the kinetic term is that of Newtonian mechanics. The energy scale relevant to the\n\nCHAPTER 2. HYDROGEN ATOM FINE STRUCTURE\nbound state spectrum can be better appreciated using the speed of light to consider both\nthe fine structure constant and the rest energy of the electron. The fine structure constant\nis given by\nα ≡e2\nħc ≃\n137 ,\n(2.1.4)\nand the rest energy of the electron is mc2. Then,\ne2\na0\n= me4\nħ2\n= mα2ħ2c2\nħ2\n= α2 mc2 .\n(2.1.5)\nThis states that the energy scale of hydrogen bound states is a factor of α2 smaller than\nthe rest energy of the electron, that is, about 19000 times smaller. We can thus rewrite the\npossible energies as:\nEn = -1\n2 α2 mc2 1\nn2 .\n(2.1.6)\nThe typical momentum in the hydrogen atom is\np ≃ħ\na0\n= me2\nħ\n= e2\nħcmc\n→\np ≃α(mc) ,\n(2.1.7)\nwhich, written as p ≃m(αc) says that the typical velocity is v ≃αc, which is low enough\nthat the non-relativistic approximation is fairly accurate. Finally, we note that\na0 =\nħ2\nm αħc =\nħ\nmc\nα = λ\nα ,\n(2.1.8)\nwhich says that the Bohr radius is over a hundred times bigger than the (reduced) Compton\nwavelength of the electron.\nThe degeneracy of the hydrogen atom spectrum is completely quantified by the relation\nn = N + l+ 1 .\n(2.1.9)\nHere N ≥0 is the degree of a polynomial in r that appears in a wavefunction where the\nleading dependence on r near the origin is factored out. The quantum number l≥0 is the\nangular momentum of the state. For each fixed n, you can see that the number lranges\nfrom zero to n -1. And for each fixed lthe eigenvalue of Lz is mħwith m ranging from\n-lup to l:\nn = 1, 2, . . .\nl= 0, 1, . . . , n -1\nm = -l, . . . , l\n# of states with energy En =\nn-1\nX\nl=0\n(2l+ 1) = n2\nThe states of hydrogen are shown in this energy diagram, which is not drawn to scale,\n\n2.1.

If we have L denote the generic\ncapital letter for angular momentum we have L(l) where\nL(l= 0) = S ,\nL(l= 1) = P ,\nL(l= 2) = D ,\nL(l= 3) = F , . . . .\n(2.1.10)\nThus, for example, an S state is a state with l= 0, a P state is a state with l= 1, and a\nD state is a state with l= 2.\nAny hydrogen eigenstate specified by the three quantum numbers n, l, m, because, as it\nfollows from (2.1.9), the value of N is then fixed. The wavefunction takes the form\nψn,l,m(x) = A\nr\na0\nl\n·\n\nPolynomial in r\na0\nof degree N\n\n· e-\nr\nna0 Yl,m(θ, φ) ,\n(2.1.11)\nwhere A is a normalization constant and N = n -(l+ 1). If you look at the wavefunction,\nthe value of n can be read from the exponential factor. The value of lcan be read from\nthe radial prefactor, or from the spherical harmonic. The value of m can be read from\nthe spherical harmonic. For the ground state n = 1, l= 0 and m = 0. The normalized\nwavefunction is\nψ1,0,0(r) =\np\nπa3\ne-r\na0 .\n(2.1.12)\nComments:\n1. There are n2 degenerate states at any energy level with principal quantum number\nn. This degeneracy explained by the existence of a conserved quantum Runge-Lenz\nvector.\nFor a given n the states with various l's correspond, in the semiclassical\npicture, to orbits of different eccentricity but the same semi-major axis. The orbit\nwith l= 0 is the most eccentric one and the orbit with maximum l= n -1 is the\nmost circular one.\n\nCHAPTER 2. HYDROGEN ATOM FINE STRUCTURE\n2. For each fixed value of l, the states have increasing N as we move up in energy. The\nnumber N is the number of nodes in the solution of the radial equation, that's why\nit is the degree of the polynomial in r that features in the wavefunction (2.1.11).\n3. The analysis of H(0) so far ignored electron spin. Since the electron is a spin one-\nhalf particle there is an extra degeneracy: each of the H(0) eigenstates is really two\ndegenerate states, one with the electron spin up and the other with the electron spin\ndown. These states are degenerate because H(0) has no spin dependence.\n4. We will have to supplement H(0) with terms that correspond to corrections that arise\nfrom relativity and from the spin of the electron. This will be the main subject of\nthe following analysis. It will determine the fine-structure of the hydrogen atom. The\ncorrections will break much of the degeneracy of the spectrum.\n5. In order to understand better the spectrum and the properties of the Hydrogen atom\none can apply an electric field, leading to the Stark effect or a magnetic field, leading\nto the Zeeman effect.\nThese external fields are represented by extra terms in the\nhydrogen atom Hamiltonian.\nLet us now discuss two different choices of basis states for the hydrogen atom, both of\nwhich include the electron spin properly.\nRecall that, in general, for a multiplet of angular momentum j, we have states (j, mj),\nwith mj running from -j to j in integer steps. All states in the multiplet are ˆJ2 eigenstates\nwith eigenvalue ħ2j(j + 1) and, for each state, ħmj is the eigenvalue of ˆJz.\nBecause the electron has spin one half, its states are labeled as\n(s, ms) ,\nwith\ns = 1\n2 ,\nms = ± 1\n2 .\n(2.1.13)\nIn the hydrogen atom the angular momentum lcan take different values, but the spin of\nthe electron is always one-half. As a result, the label s is often omitted, and we usually only\nrecord the value of ms. For hydrogen basis states we thus have quantum numbers n, l, ml,\nand ms. To avoid confusion, we have added the lsubscript to ml, thus emphasizing that\nthis is the azimuthal quantum number for orbital angular momentum. Since we are not\ncombining the electron spin to its orbital angular momentum, the states form the \"uncoupled\nbasis\":\nUncoupled basis quantum numbers:\n(n, l, ml, ms) .\n(2.1.14)\nThe states are completely specified by these quantum numbers. As we let those quantum\nnumbers run over all possible values we obtain an orthonormal basis of states.\nIt is often useful to use an alternative basis where the states are eigenstates of ˆJ2 and ˆJz,\nwhere the total angular momentum ˆJ is obtained by adding the orbital angular momentum\nˆL to the spin angular momentum ˆS:\nˆJ = ˆL + ˆS .\n(2.1.15)\n\n2.1. REVIEW OF HYDROGEN ATOM\nWhen we form l⊗s we are tensoring a a full lmultiplet to an s multiplet (here, of course,\ns = 1/2). All states in l⊗s are eigenstates of ˆL2 and eigenstates of ˆS2, so land s are good\n(constant) quantum numbers for all j multiplets that arise in the tensor product. Each j\nmultiplet has states with quantum numbers (j, mj).\nThe coupled basis is one where states are organized into j multiplets. While states are\nno longer ˆLz nor ˆSz eigenstates they are still ˆL2 eigenstates, thus the lquantum number\nsurvives. The coupled basis quantum numbers are therefore\nCoupled basis quantum numbers:\n(n, l, j, mj) .\n(2.1.16)\nThe (ml, ms) quantum numbers of the uncoupled basis have been traded for (j, mj) quan-\ntum numbers and we have kept the n, lquantum numbers. The coupled states are linear\ncombinations of uncoupled states that involve different values of mland ms, those combi-\nnations that yield the same value of mj = ml+ ms.\nTo find the list of coupled basis states we must tensor each lmultiplet in the hydrogen\natom spectrum with the spin doublet 1\n2. The rules of addition of angular momentum imply\nthat we find two j multiplets:\nl⊗1\n2 = (j = l+ 1\n2) ⊕(j = l-1\n2) .\n(2.1.17)\nFor l= 0, we only obtain a j = 1/2 multiplet. We use the notation Lj for the coupled\nmultiplets, with L = S, P, D, F for l= 0, 1, 2, and 3 (see (2.1.10). The change of basis is\nsummarized by the replacements\nl⊗1\n→\nL(l)j=l+ 1\n⊕L(l)j=l-1\n(2.1.18)\nor more explicitly,\n0 ⊗1\n→\nS 1\n1 ⊗1\n→\nP 3\n2 ⊕P 1\n2 ⊗1\n→\nD 5\n2 ⊕D 3\n3 ⊗1\n→\nF 7\n2 ⊕F 5\n(2.1.19)\nThus, by the time we combine with electron spin, each l= 0 state gives one j = 1\n2 multiplet,\neach l= 1 state gives j = 3\n2 and j = 1\n2 multiplets, each l= 2 state gives j = 5\n2 and j = 3\nmultiplets, and so on. For hydrogen, the principal quantum number is placed ahead to\ndenote the coupled multiplets by\nCoupled basis notation for multiplets:\nnLj\n(2.1.20)\nUsing this notation for coupled basis multiplets the diagram of hydrogen atom energy\neigenstates becomes:\n\nCHAPTER 2.

Since the electron is moving relative to the frame where we have\na static electric field, the electron also sees a magnetic field B. The spin-orbit coupling is\nthe coupling -μ·B of that magnetic field to the magnetic dipole moment μ of the electron.\nWe have discussed before, in the context of the Stern-Gerlach experiment, the value of\nthe magnetic dipole moment of the electron. Recall the logic we used. In Gaussian units,\nthe classical magnetic moment of a planar current loop is given by μ = I\nca, where I is the\ncurrent and a is the area vector associated with the loop. From this one quickly derives\nthat for a uniformly rotating particle with charge q and mass m the magnetic moment is\nμ =\nq\n2mcL ,\n(2.2.1)\nwhere L is the angular momentum due to the rotation. For an elementary particle, this\nmotivates the following relation between the spin angular momentum operator ˆS and the\nmagnetic moment\nμ = g\nq\n2mc\nˆS\n(2.2.2)\nwhere g is a factor that is added to parameterize our ignorance; after all there is no reason\nwhy the classically motivated formula for the magnetic dipole should hold in the quantum\ndomain of spin. As it turns out, for an electron one has g = 2. Since q = -e for an electron,\n\n2.2. THE PAULI EQUATION\nwe have\nμ = 2 -e\n2mec\nˆS = -2\neħ\n2mec\nˆS\nħ= -2\neħ\n2mec\n2σ = -\neħ\n2mec σ .\n(2.2.3)\nFor numerical applications we note that the Bohr magneton μB is defined by\nμB =\neħ\n2mec ≃9.274 × 10-21\nerg\ngauss = 5.79 × 10-9\neV\ngauss .\n(2.2.4)\n(for SI values use Tesla = 104 gauss). The coupling of an electron to an external magnetic\nfield is therefore represented by a Hamiltonian HB given by\nHB = -μ · B =\neħ\n2mec σ · B .\n(2.2.5)\nOur goal now is to show that this coupling, and its associated prediction of g = 2, arises\nnaturally from the non-relativistic Pauli equation for an electron.\nConsider first the time-independent Schr odinger equation for a free particle:\nˆp2\n2mψ = E ψ .\n(2.2.6)\nSince a spin one-half particle has two degrees of freedom, usually assembled into a column\nvector χ, the expected equation for a free spin one-half particle is\nˆp2\n2mχ = E χ\nwith\nχ =\nχ1\nχ2\n\n.\n(2.2.7)\nOne sometimes calls χ a Pauli spinor. Note there's an implicit two-by-two identity matrix\n12×2 in the Hamiltonian\nH =\nˆp2\n2m 12×2 .\n(2.2.8)\nWe can rewrite this Hamiltonian using Pauli matrices if we recall the identity\n(σ · a)(σ · b) = a · b 12×2 + iσ · (a × b) ,\n(2.2.9)\nvalid for arbitrary vector operators a and b. Taking a = b = ˆp, with ˆp the momentum\noperator, and recognizing that ˆp × ˆp = 0, we have\n(σ · ˆp) · (σ · ˆp) = ˆp2 12×2 .\n(2.2.10)\nThis means that the Hamiltonian (2.2.8) can be rewritten as\nH =\n2m (σ · ˆp)(σ · ˆp) .\n(2.2.11)\n\nCHAPTER 2. HYDROGEN ATOM FINE STRUCTURE\nSo far, this is all just rewriting with no change in physics. But new things happen when we\nthe particle is charged and we couple it to external electromagnetic fields. The quantum\nmechanical rule is that this inclusion can be taken care with the replacement\nˆp →ˆπ ≡ˆp -q\nc A .\n(2.2.12)\nHere q is the charge of the particle and A is the external vector potential, a function\nof position that becomes an operator A(ˆx) since position is an operator. In addition, if\nthere is a electromagnetic scalar potential Φ it contributes an additional term qΦ(ˆx) to the\nHamiltonian.\nWith the replacement (2.2.12) applied to the Hamiltonian (2.2.11), and the inclusion of\nthe coupling to the scalar potential, we get the Pauli Hamiltonian:\nHPauli =\n2m (σ · ˆπ) (σ · ˆπ) + qΦ(ˆx) .\n(2.2.13)\nThis time, using the identity (2.2.9), the second term survives\nHPauli =\n2m [(ˆπ · ˆπ)1 + iσ · (ˆπ × ˆπ)] + qΦ(ˆx) .\n(2.2.14)\nWe have ˆπ × ˆπ = 0 because the various πi do not commute. Note that the replacement\n(2.2.12) applied to the original Hamiltonian (2.2.8) would not have given us the ˆπ× ˆπ term.\nTo evaluate that term we use\n(ˆπ × ˆπ)k = oijkˆπiˆπj =\n2oijk[ˆπi, ˆπj] .\n(2.2.15)\nThe commutator here is\n[ πi , πj ] =\nh\npi -q\ncAi , pj -q\nc Aj\ni\n.\n(2.2.16)\nAs usual, the ˆp components can be thought of as derivatives acting on the spatially de-\npendent components of A. Moreover, the Ai's being only functions of position, commute\namong themselves and we have\n[ πi , πj ] = -ħ\ni\nq\nc (∂iAj -∂jAi) = iħq\nc (∂iAj -∂jAi) .\n(2.2.17)\nTherefore, back in (2.2.16)\n(π × π)k =\n2oijk\niħq\nc (∂iAj -∂jAi) = iħq\nc oijk∂iAj = iħq\nc (∇× A)k ,\n(2.2.18)\nleading to the elegant result:\nˆπ × ˆπ = iħq\nc B .\n(2.2.19)\n\n2.3. THE DIRAC EQUATION\nThis equation is a bit reminiscent of the equation ˆL × ˆL = iħˆL, for angular momentum.\nBack in the Pauli Hamiltonian (2.2.14), leaving identity matrices implicit, and setting\nq = -e, we find\nHPauli =\n2m\n\nˆp + e\nc A\n+\ni\n2m\niħq\nc σ · B -eΦ(ˆx)\n=\n2m\n\nˆp + e\nc A\n+ eħ\n2mcσ · B -eΦ(ˆx) .\n(2.2.20)\nThe second term in this expanded Pauli Hamiltonian gives the coupling of the electron spin\nto the magnetic field and agrees precisely with the expected coupling (2.2.5). We thus see\nthat the Pauli equation predicts the g = 2 value in the electron magnetic moment.\n2.3\nThe Dirac equation\nWhile the Pauli equation incorporates correctly the coupling of the electron spin to electro-\nmagnetic fields, it is not a relativistic equation. As discovered by Dirac, to include relativity\none has to work with matrices and the Pauli spinor must be upgraded to a four-component\nspinor.\nThe analysis begins with the familiar relation between relativistic energies and\nmomenta\nE2 -p2c2 = m2c4\n→\nE =\np\np2c2 + m2c4\n(2.3.1)\nThis suggests that a relativistic Hamiltonian for a free particle could take the form\nH =\np\nˆp2c2 + m2c4 ,\n(2.3.2)\nwith associated Schr odinger equation\niħ∂ψ\n∂t =\np\nˆp2c2 + m2c4 ψ .\n(2.3.3)\nIt is not clear how to treat the square root so, at least for small velocities p ≪mc, the\nHamiltonian can be expanded:\nH = mc2\nr\n1 +\nˆp2\nm2c2 = mc2\n\"\n1 +\nˆp2\n2m2c2 -1\nˆp2\nm2c2\n+ . . .\n#\n= mc2 + ˆp2\n2m -1\nˆp4\nm3c2 + . . .\n(2.3.4)\nIf we ignore the constant rest mass, the first term is the familiar non-relativistic Hamiltonian,\nand the next term is the first nontrivial relativistic correction. For small momenta we will\ntreat that term as a perturbation.\nMore elegantly, Dirac wanted to find a Hamiltonian linear in momenta and without\nsquare roots. This would be possible if one could write the relativistic energy as the square\nof a linear function of the momentum:\nc2ˆp2 + m2c4 = (cα · ˆp + βmc2)2 = (cα1ˆp1 + cα2ˆp2 + cα3ˆp3 + βmc2)2 .\n(2.3.5)\n\nCHAPTER 2. HYDROGEN ATOM FINE STRUCTURE\nExpanding the right-hand side and equating coefficients one finds that the following must\nhold\nα2\n1 = α2\n2 = α2\n3 = β2 = 1 ,\nαiαj + αjαi = {αi, αj} = 0 ,\ni = j ,\nαiβ + βαi = {αi, β} = 0 .\n(2.3.6)\nThe relations on the second and third lines imply that α's and β's can't be numbers, because\nthey would have to be zero. It turns out that α's and β's are four-by-four hermitian matrices:\nα =\nσ\nσ\n\n,\nβ =\n-1\n\n.\n(2.3.7)\nUsing (2.3.5), the Dirac Hamiltonian is simply the linear function of momentum that is the\nsquare root of c2ˆp2 + m2c4. We thus have\nHDirac = cα · p + βmc2 .\n(2.3.8)\nThe Dirac equation is\niħ∂Ψ\n∂t =\ncα · p + βmc2\nΨ ,\n(2.3.9)\nwhere Ψ is a Dirac spinor, a four-component column vector that can be thought to be\ncomposed by two two-component Pauli spinors χ and η:\nΨ =\nχ\nη\n\n,\nχ =\nχ1\nχ2\n\n,\nη =\nη1\nη2\n\n.\n(2.3.10)\nThe coupling to electromagnetic fields is done as before\niħ∂Ψ\n∂t =\nh\ncα ·\n\nˆp + e\ncA\n\n+ βmc2 + V (r)\ni\nΨ ,\n(2.3.11)\nwhere the coupling of the electron to the scalar potential Φ(r) is included via\nV (r) = -eΦ(r) = -e2\nr .\n(2.3.12)\nThe great advantage of the Dirac equation (2.3.11) is that the corrections to the hydrogen\nHamiltonian H(0) can be derived systematically by finding the appropriate Hamiltonian H\nthat acts on the Pauli spinor χ. The analysis, can be done with A = 0, since the stationary\nproton creates no vector potential. The result of the analysis shows that\nHχ = Eχ ,\n(2.3.13)\nwhere:\nH =\nˆp2\n2m + V\n|\n{z\n}\nH(0)\n-\nˆp4\n8m3c2\n| {z }\nδHrel.\n+\n2m2c2\nr\ndV\ndr S · L\n|\n{z\n}\nδHspin-orbit\n+\nħ2\n8m2c2 ∇2V\n|\n{z\n}\nδHDarwin\n.\n(2.3.14)\n\n2.4. FINE STRUCTURE OF HYDROGEN\nThe first correction is the relativistic energy correction anticipated earlier. The second is\nthe spin-orbit coupling, and the third is the Darwin correction, that as we shall see affects\nonly l= 0 states.\nRecall that the energy scale for H(0) eigenstates is α2mc2. We will now see that all the\nabove energy corrections are of order α4mc2 thus smaller by a factor of α2 ≃\n19000 than the\nzeroth-order energies. This suggests that for the hydrogen atom, the role of the unit-free\nparameter λ of perturbation theory is taken by the fine structure constant: λ ∼α2. Of\ncourse, in reality we cannot adjust the value of α2 nor we can take it to zero.\nFor the relativistic correction, recalling that p ≃α mc, we indeed have\nδHrel. = -\np4\n8m3c2 ∼-α4mc2 .\n(2.3.15)\nFor spin-orbit we first rewrite the term, using\nr\ndV\ndr = 1\nr\nd\ndr\n\n-e2\nr\n\n= e2\nr3 ,\n(2.3.16)\nso that\nδHspin-orbit =\ne2\n2m2c2\nr3 S · L .\n(2.3.17)\nFor an estimate we set S · L ∼ħ2, r ∼a0, and recall that a0 =\nħ\nmc\nα:\nδHspin-orbit ∼\ne2\nm2c2\nħ2\na3\n=\nα ħc\nm2c2\nħ2\na3\n= α\n\nħ\nmca0\nmc2 = α4 mc2 .\n(2.3.18)\nWe can evaluate the Darwin term using V = -e2/r:\nδHDarwin = -e2ħ2\n8m2c2 ∇2\nr\n\n= e2ħ2\n8m2c2 (-4πδ(r)) = π\ne2ħ2\nm2c2 δ(r) .\n(2.3.19)\nTo estimate this correction note that, due to the δ function the the integral in the expecta-\ntion value will introduce a factor |ψ(0)|2 ∼a-3\n0 . We will therefore have\nδHDarwin ∼\ne2ħ2\nm2c2a3\n∼α4 mc2 ,\n(2.3.20)\nas this is exactly the same combination of constants that we had for spin orbit above.\n2.4\nFine structure of hydrogen\nThe fine structure of hydrogen is the spectrum of the atom once one takes into account the\ncorrections indicated in (2.3.14). After the partial simplifications considered above we have\nH =\nˆp2\n2m + V\n|\n{z\n}\nH(0)\n-\nˆp4\n8m3c2\n| {z }\nδHrel.\n+\ne2\n2m2c2\nS · L\nr3\n|\n{z\n}\nδHspin-orbit\n+\nπ\ne2ħ2\nm2c2 δ(r)\n|\n{z\n}\nδHDarwin\n.\n(2.4.21)\n\nCHAPTER 2. HYDROGEN ATOM FINE STRUCTURE\nWe will study each of these terms separately and then combine our results to give the fine\nstructure of hydrogen. There are further smaller corrections that we will not examine here,\nsuch as hyperfine splitting and Lamb effect.\n2.4.1\nDarwin correction\nLet us now evaluate the Darwin correction.\nSince this interaction has a delta function\nat the origin, the first order correction to the energy vanishes unless the wavefunction is\nnon-zero at the origin. This can only happen for nS states. There is no need to use the\napparatus of degenerate perturbation theory. Indeed, for fixed n there are two orthogonal\nl= 0 states, one with electron spin up and one with electron spin down. While these states\nare degenerate, the Darwin perturbation commutes with spin and is therefore diagonal in\nthe two-dimensional subspace. There is no need to include the spin in the calculation and\nwe have\nE(1)\nn00,Darwin = ⟨ψn00|δHDarwin|ψn00⟩= π\ne2ħ2\nm2c2 |ψn00(0)|2 .\n(2.4.22)\nAs is shown in the homework, the radial equation can be used to determine the value of the\nnS wavefunctions at the origin. You will find that\n|ψn00(0)|2 =\nπ n3a3\n.\n(2.4.23)\nAs a result\nE(1)\nn00,Darwin =\ne2ħ2\n2m2c2\na3\n0n3 = α4(mc2) 1\n2n3 .\n(2.4.24)\nThis completes the evaluation of the Darwin correction\nThe Darwin term in the Hamiltonian arises from the elimination of one of the two two-\ncomponent spinors in the Dirac equation. As we will show now such a correction would arise\nfrom a nonlocal correction to the potential energy term. It is as if the electron had grown\nfrom point-like to a ball with radius of order its Compton wavelength\nħ\nmec. The potential\nenergy due to the field of the proton must then be calculated by integrating the varying\nelectric potential over the charge distribution of the electron. While a simple estimate of\nthis nonlocal potential energy does reproduce the Darwin correction rather closely, one must\nnot reach the conclusion that the electron is no longer a point particle. Still the fact remains\nthat in a relativistic treatment of an electron, its Compton wavelength is relevant and is\nphysically the shortest distance an electron can be localized.\nThe potential energy V (r) of the electron, as a point particle, is the product of the\nelectron charge (-e) times the electric potential Φ(r) created by the proton:\nV (r) = (-e)Φ(r) = (-e) e\nr .\n(2.4.25)\nLet us call eV (r) the potential energy when the electron is a charge distribution centered\nat a point r with |r| = r (see Figure 2.1). This energy is obtained by integration over the\n\n2.4. FINE STRUCTURE OF HYDROGEN\nFigure 2.1: A Darwin type correction to the energy arises if the electron charge is smeared over a\nregion of size comparable to its Compton wavelength.

Using the vector u to define position relative to the center P of the\nelectron, and letting ρ(u) denote the position dependent charge density, we have\neV (r) =\nZ\nelectron\nd3u ρ(u)Φ(r + u) ,\n(2.4.26)\nwhere, as shown in the Figure, r + u is the position of the integration point, measured\nrelative to the proton at the origin. It is convenient to write the charge density in terms of\na normalized function ρ0:\nρ(u) = -e ρ0(u)\n→\nZ\nelectron\nd3u ρ0(u) = 1 ,\n(2.4.27)\nwhich guarantees that the integral of ρ over the electron is indeed (-e). Recalling that\n-eΦ(r + u) = V (r + u) we now rewrite (2.4.26) as\neV (r) =\nZ\nelectron\nd3u ρ0(u)V (r + u) .\n(2.4.28)\nThis equation has a clear interpretation: the potential energy is obtained as a weighted\nintegral of potential due to the proton over the extended electron. If the electron charge\nwould be perfectly localized, ρ0(u) = δ(u) and V (r) would just be equal to V (r). We will\nassume that the distribution of charge is spherically symmetric, so that\nρ0 (u) = ρ0(u) .\n(2.4.29)\n\nCHAPTER 2. HYDROGEN ATOM FINE STRUCTURE\nTo evaluate (2.4.31), we first do a Taylor expansion of the potential that enters the integral\nabout the point u = 0:\nV (r + u) = V (r) +\nX\ni\n∂iV\n\nrui + 1\nX\ni,j\n∂i∂jV\n\nruiuj + . . .\n(2.4.30)\nAll derivatives here are evaluated at the center of the electron.\nPlugging back into the\nintegral (2.4.31) and dropping the subscript 'electron' we have\neV (r) =\nZ\nd3u ρ0(u)\n\nV (r) +\nX\ni\n∂iV\n\nrui + 1\nX\ni,j\n∂i∂jV\n\nruiuj + . . .\n\n.\n(2.4.31)\nAll r dependent functions can be taken out of the integrals. Recalling that the integral of\nρ0 over volume is one, we get\nV (r) = V (r) +\nX\ni\n∂iV\n\nr\nZ\nd3u ρ0 (u) ρi + 1\nX\ni,j\n∂i∂jV\n\nr\nZ\nd3u ρ0 (u) uiuj+. . . (2.4.32)\nDue to spherical symmetry the first integral vanishes and the second takes the form\nZ\nd3u ρ0 (u) uiuj =\n3δij\nZ\nd3u ρ0 (u) u2 .\n(2.4.33)\nIndeed the integral must vanish for i = j and must take equal values for i = j = 1, 2, 3.\nSince u2 = u2\n1 + u2\n2 + u2\n3, the result follows. Using this we get\nV (r) = V (r) +\nX\ni\n∂i∂iV\n\nr\nZ\nd3u f (u) ρ2 + . . .\n= V (r) +\n6∇2V\nZ\nd3u ρ0 (u) u2 + . . . .\n(2.4.34)\nThe second term represents the correction δV to the potential energy:\nδV\n=\n6∇2V\nZ\nd3u ρ0 (u) u2 .\n(2.4.35)\nTo get an estimate, let us assume that the charge is distributed uniformly over a sphere of\nradius u0. This means that ρ0(u) is a constant for u < u0\nρ0(u) =\n4πu3\n\n1,\nu < u0,\n0,\nu > u0 .\n(2.4.36)\nThe integral one must evaluate then gives\nZ\nd3u ρ0(u)u2 =\nZ u0\n4πu2du u2\n4π\n3 u3\n= 3\nu3\nZ u0\nu4du = 3\n5u2\n0 .\n(2.4.37)\n\n2.4. FINE STRUCTURE OF HYDROGEN\nTherefore,\nδV\n=\n10u2\n0 ∇2V .\n(2.4.38)\nIf we choose the radius u0 of the charge distribution to be the Compton wavelength\nħ\nmc of\nthe electron we get,\nδV\n=\nħ2\n10 m2c2 ∇2V .\n(2.4.39)\nComparing with (2.3.14) we see that, up to a small correction (1\n8 as opposed to\n10), this\nis the Darwin energy shift. The agreement is surprisingly good for what is, admittedly, a\nheuristic argument.\n2.4.2\nRelativistic correction\nWe now turn to the relativistic correction. The energy shifts of the hydrogen states can\nbe analyzed among the degenerate states with principal quantum number n.\nWe write\ntentatively for the corrections\nE(1)\nn,lmlms;rel = -\n8m3c2 ⟨ψnlmlms|p2p2|ψnlml⟩.\n(2.4.40)\nWe can use this formula because the uncoupled basis of states at fixed n is good: the\nperturbation is diagonal in this basis. This is checked using Remark 3 in section 1.2.2. This\nis clear because the perturbing operator p2p2 commutes with L2, with Lz, and with Sz.\nThe first operator guarantees that that the matrix for the perturbation is diagonal in l, the\nsecond guarantees that the perturbation is diagonal in ml, and the third guarantees, rather\ntrivially, that the perturbation is diagonal in ms.\nTo evaluate the matrix element we use the Hermiticity of p2 to move one of the factors\ninto the bra\nE(1)\nn,lmlms;rel = -\n8m3c2 ⟨p2ψnlm|p2ψnlm⟩,\n(2.4.41)\nwhere in the right-hand side we evaluated the trivial expectation value for the spin degrees\nof freedom. To simplify the evaluation we use the Schr odinger equation, which tells us that\np2\n2m + V\n\nψnlm = E(0)\nn ψnlm\n→\np2ψnlm = 2m(E(0)\nn\n-V )ψnlm .\n(2.4.42)\nUsing this both for the bra and the ket:\nE(1)\nn,lmlms;rel = -\n2mc2\nD\n(E(0)\nn\n-V )ψnlm\n(E(0)\nn\n-V )ψnlm\nE\n.\n(2.4.43)\nThe operator E(0)\nn\n-V is also Hermitian and can be moved from the bra to the ket, giving\nE(1)\nn,lmlms;rel = -\n2mc2\nD\nψnlm\n( (E(0)\nn )2 -2V E(0)\nn\n+ V 2)\nψnlm\nE\n= -\n2mc2\nh\n(E(0)\nn )2 -2En⟨V ⟩nlm + ⟨V 2⟩nlm\ni\n.\n(2.4.44)\n\nCHAPTER 2. HYDROGEN ATOM FINE STRUCTURE\nThe problem has been reduced to the computation of the expectation value of V (r) and\nV 2(r) in the ψnlm state. The expectation value of V (r) is obtained from the virial theorem\nthat states that ⟨V ⟩= 2E(0)\nn . For V 2(r) we have\n⟨V 2⟩= e4D 1\nr2\nE\n= e4\na2\n0n3 l+ 1\n=\ne2\n2a0\nn2\n4n\nl+ 1\n= (E(0)\nn )2 ·\n4n\nl+ 1\n.\n(2.4.45)\nBack into (2.4.44) we find\nE(1)\nn,lmlms;rel = -(E(0)\nn )2\n2mc2\nh\n4n\nl+ 1\n-3\ni\n= -1\n8 α4 (mc2)\nn4\nh\n4n\nl+ 1\n-3\ni\n.\n(2.4.46)\nThe complete degeneracy of lmultiplets for a given n has been broken. That degeneracy\nof H(0) was explained by the conserved Runge-Lenz vector. It is clear that the relativistic\ncorrection has broken that symmetry.\nWe have computed the above correction using the uncoupled basis\nE(1)\nn,lmlms;rel = ⟨nlmms|δHrel|nlmms⟩= f(n, l) .\n(2.4.47)\nHere we added the extra equality to emphasize that the matrix elements depend only on n\nand l. We have already seen that in the full degenerate subspace with principal quantum\nnumber n the matrix for δHrel is diagonal in the uncoupled basis. But now we see that in\neach degenerate subspace of fixed n and l, δHrel is in fact a multiple of the identity matrix,\nsince the matrix elements are independent of m and ms (the Lz and Sz) eigenvalues. A\nmatrix equal to a multiple of the identity is invariant under any orthonormal change of\nbasis. For any l⊗1\n2 multiplet, the resulting j multiplets provide an alternative orthonormal\nbasis. The invariance of a matrix proportional to the identity implies that\nE(1)\nnljmj,rel = ⟨nljmj|δHrel|nljmj⟩= f(n, l) .\n(2.4.48)\nwith the same function f(n, l) as in (2.4.47), and the perturbation is diagonal in this coupled\nbasis too. This is clear anyway because the perturbation commutes with L2, J2 and Jz and\nand any two degenerate states in the coupled basis differ either in l, j or jz.\nThe preservation of the matrix elements can also be argued more explicitly. Indeed,\nany state in the coupled basis is a superposition of orthonormal uncoupled basis states with\nconstant coefficients ci:\n|nljmj⟩=\nX\ni\nci|nlmi\nlmi\ns⟩,\nwith\nX\ni\n|ci|2 = 1 ,\n(2.4.49)\nbecause the state on the left-hand side must also have unit norm. Therefore, using the\n\n2.4. FINE STRUCTURE OF HYDROGEN\ndiagonal nature of the matrix elements in the uncoupled basis we get, as claimed\n⟨nljmj|δHrel|nljmj⟩=\nX\ni,k\nc∗\ni ck⟨nlmi\nlmi\ns|δHrel|nlmk\nlmk\ns⟩\n=\nX\ni\n|ci|2⟨nlmi\nlmi\ns|δHrel|nlmi\nlmi\ns⟩\n=\nX\ni\n|ci|2f(n, l) = f(n, l) .\n(2.4.50)\n2.4.3\nSpin orbit coupling\nThe spin-orbit contribution to the Hamiltonian is\nδHspin-orbit =\ne2\n2m2c2\nr3 S · L .\n(2.4.51)\nNote that δHspin-orbit commutes with L2 because L2 commutes with any ˆLi and any ˆSi.\nMoreover, δHspin-orbit commutes with J2 and with Jz since, in fact, [ ˆJi , S · L] = 0 for\nany i; S · L is a scalar operator for J. It follows that δHspin-orbit is diagonal in the level\nn degenerate subspace in the coupled basis |nljmj⟩. In fact, as we will see, the matrix\nelements are m-independent. This is a nontrivial consequence of δHspin-orbit being a scalar\nunder J. To compute the matrix elements we recall that J = S + L and\nE(1)\nnljmj; spin-orbit =\ne2\n2m2c2\nD\nnljmj\nr3 S · L\nnljmj\nE\n=\ne2\n2m2c2\nħ2\n\nj(j + 1) -l(l+ 1) -3\nD\nnljmj\nr3\nnljmj\nE\n.\n(2.4.52)\nWe need the expectation value of 1/r3 in these states. It is known that\nD\nnlml\nr3\nnlml\nE\n=\nn3a3\n0l\nl+ 1\n\n(l+ 1) .\n(2.4.53)\nBecause of the mlindependence of this expectation value (and its obvious ms independence)\nthe operator 1/r3 is a multiple of the identity matrix in each l⊗1\n2 multiplet. It follows that\nit is the same multiple of the identity in the coupled basis description. Therefore\nD\nnljmj\nr3\nnljmj\nE\n=\nn3a3\n0l\nl+ 1\n\n(l+ 1) .\n(2.4.54)\nUsing this in (2.4.52)\nE(1)\nnljmj; spin-orbit = e2ħ2\n4m2c2\n\nj(j + 1) -l(l+ 1) -3\n\nn3a3\n0l\nl+ 1\n\n(l+ 1)\n.\n(2.4.55)\n\nCHAPTER 2. HYDROGEN ATOM FINE STRUCTURE\nWorking out the constants in terms of E(0)\nn\nand rest energies we get\nE(1)\nnljmj; spin-orbit = (E(0)\nn )2\nmc2\nn\n\nj(j + 1) -l(l+ 1) -3\n\nl\nl+ 1\n\n(l+ 1)\n,\nl= 0 .\n(2.4.56)\nSince L vanishes identically acting on any l= 0 state, it is physically reasonable, as we will\ndo, to assume that the spin-orbit correction vanishes for l= 0 states. On the other hand\nthe limit of the above formula as l→0, while somewhat ambiguous, is nonzero. We set\nj = l+ 1\n2 (the other possibility j = l-1\n2 does not apply for l= 0) and then take the limit\nas l→0. Indeed,\nE(1)\nnljmj; spin-orbit\n\nj=l+ 1\n= (E(0)\nn )2\nmc2\nn\n\n(l+ 1\n2)(l+ 3\n2) -l(l+ 1) -3\n\nl\nl+ 1\n\n(l+ 1)\n= (E(0)\nn )2\nmc2\nn\nl+ 1\n\n(l+ 1) ,\n(2.4.57)\nand now taking the limit:\nlim\nl→0 E(1)\nnljmj; spin-orbit\n\nj=l+ 1\n=\n(E(0)\nn )2\nmc2\n(2n) = α4 mc2\n2n3 .\n(2.4.58)\nWe see that this limit is in fact identical to the Darwin shift (2.4.24) of the nS states. This\nis a bit surprising and will play a technical role below.\n2.4.4\nCombining results\nFor l= 0 states we can add the energy shifts from spin-orbit and from the relativistic\ncorrection, both of them expressed as expectation values in the coupled basis. The result,\ntherefore will give the shifts of the coupled states. Collecting our results (2.4.46) and (2.4.56)\nwe have\nD\nnljmj\nδHrel + δHspin-orbit\nnljmj\nE\n= (E(0)\nn )2\n2mc2\n(\n3 -\n4n\nl+ 1\n+ 2n\n\nj(j + 1) -l(l+ 1) -3\n\nl\nl+ 1\n\n(l+ 1)\n)\n= (E(0)\nn )2\n2mc2\n(\n3 + 2n\n\"\nj(j + 1) -3l(l+ 1) -3\nl\nl+ 1\n\n(l+ 1)\n#)\n.\n(2.4.59)\nThese are the fine structure energy shifts for all states in the spectrum of hydrogen. The\nstates in a coupled multiplet are characterized by l, j and mj and each multiplet as a whole\nis shifted according to the above formula. The degeneracy within the multiplet is unbroken\nbecause the formula has no mj dependence. This formula, as written, hides some additional\ndegeneracies. We uncover those next.\n\n2.4. FINE STRUCTURE OF HYDROGEN\nIn the above formula there are two cases to consider for any fixed value of j: the multiplet\ncan have l= j -1\n2 or the multiplet can have l= j + 1\n2. We will now see something rather\nsurprising. In both of these cases the shift is the same, meaning that the shift is in fact l\nindependent! It just depends on j. Call f(j, l) the term in brackets above\nf(j, l) ≡j(j + 1) -3l(l+ 1) -3\nl\nl+ 1\n\n(l+ 1)\n.\n(2.4.60)\nThe evaluation of this expression in both cases gives the same result:\nf(j, l)\n\nl=j-1\n= j(j + 1) -3(j -1\n2)(j + 1\n2) -3\nj -1\n\nj\nj + 1\n\n=\n-2j2 + j\nj\nj -1\nj + 1\n= -\nj + 1\n,\nf(j, l)\n\nl=j+ 1\n= j(j + 1) -3(j + 1\n2)(j + 3\n2) -3\nj + 1\n\n(j + 1)\nj + 3\n\n=\n2j2 -5j -3\nj + 1\n\n(j + 1)\nj + 3\n= -\nj + 1\n.\n(2.4.61)\nWe can therefore replace in (2.4.59) the result of our evaluation, which we label as fine\nstructure (fs) shifts:\nE(1)\nnlj,mj;fs = -(E(0)\nn )2\n2mc2\nh\n4n\nj + 1\n-3\ni\n= -α4(mc2) 1\n2n4\nh\nn\nj + 1\n-3\ni\n.\n(2.4.62)\nMore briefly we can write\nE(1)\nnlj,mj;fine = -α4mc2 · Sn,j ,\nwith\nSn,j ≡\n2n4\nh\nn\nj + 1\n-3\ni\n.\n(2.4.63)\nLet us consider a few remarks:\n1. The dependence on j and absence of dependence on lin the energy shifts could be\nanticipated from the Dirac equation. The rotation generator that commutes with the\nDirac Hamiltonian is J = L+S, which simultaneously rotates position, momenta, and\nspin states. Neither L nor S are separately conserved. With J a symmetry, states are\nexpected to be labelled by energy and j and must be mj independent.\n2. The formula (2.4.63) works for nS states! For these l= 0 states we were supposed\nto add the relativistic correction and the Darwin correction, since their spin-orbit\ncorrection is zero. But we noticed that the limit l→0 of the spin-orbit correction\nreproduces the Darwin term.\nWhether or not this is a meaningful coincidence, it\nmeans the sum performed above gives the right answer for l→0.\n3. While a large amount of the degeneracy of H(0) has been broken, for fixed n, multiplets\nwith the same value of j, regardless of l, remain degenerate. The states in each j\nmultiplet do not split.\n\nCHAPTER 2. HYDROGEN ATOM FINE STRUCTURE\n4. Since Sn,j > 0 all energy shifts are down.

ZEEMAN EFFECT\nFor the record, the total energy of the hydrogen states is the zeroth contribution plus\nthe fine structure contribution. Together they give\nEnljmj = -e2\n2a0\nn2\nh\n1 + α2\nn2\n\nn\nj + 1\n-3\ni\n.\n(2.4.65)\nThis is the fine structure of hydrogen! There are, of course, finer corrections. The so-\ncalled Lamb shift, for example, breaks the degeneracy between 2S1/2 and 2P1/2 and is of\norder α5. There is also hyperfine splitting, which arises from the coupling of the magnetic\nmoment of the proton to the magnetic moment of the electron. Such coupling leads to a\nsplitting that is a factor me/mp smaller than fine structure.\n2.5\nZeeman effect\nIn remarkable experiment done in 1896, the Dutch physicist Pieter Zeeman (1865-1943)\ndiscovered that atomic spectral lines are split in the presence of an external magnetic field.\nFor this work Zeeman was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1902. The proper understanding of\nthis phenomenon had to wait for Quantum Mechanics.\nThe splitting of atomic energy levels by a constant, uniform, external magnetic field, the\nZeeman effect, has been used as a tool to measure inaccessible magnetic fields. In observing\nthe solar spectrum, a single atomic line, as seen from light emerging from outside a sunspot,\nsplits into various lines inside the sunspot. We have learned that magnetic fields inside a\nsunspot typically reach 3, 000 gauss. Sunspots are a bit darker and have lower temperature\nthan the rest of the solar surface. They can last from hours to months, and their magnetic\nenergy can turn into powerful solar flares.\nThe external magnetic field interacts with the total magnetic moment of the electron.\nThe electron has magnetic moment due to its orbital angular momentum and one due to\nits spin\nμl= -e\n2mc L ,\nμs = -e\nmc S ,\n(2.5.1)\nwhere we included the g = 2 factor in the spin contribution. The Zeeman Hamiltonian is\nthus given by\nδHZeeman = -(μl+ μs) · B =\ne\n2mc (L + 2S) · B .\n(2.5.2)\nConventionally, we align the magnetic field with the positive z axis so that B = B z and\nthus get\nδHZeeman =\neB\n2mc (ˆLz + 2 ˆSz) .\n(2.5.3)\nWhen we consider the Zeeman effect on Hydrogen we must not forget fine structure.\nThe full Hamiltonian to be considered is\nH = H(0) + δHfs + δHZeeman .\n(2.5.4)\n\nCHAPTER 2. HYDROGEN ATOM FINE STRUCTURE\nRecall that in fine structure, there is an internal magnetic field Bint associated with spin-\norbit coupling. This is the magnetic field seen by the electron as it goes around the proton.\nWe have therefore two extreme possibilities concerning the external magnetic field B of the\nZeeman effect:\n(1) Weak-field Zeeman effect: B ≪Bint. In this case the Zeeman effect is small compared\nwith fine structure effects. Accordingly, the original Hamiltonian H(0) together with\nthe fine structure Hamiltonian Hfs are thought as the \"known\" Hamiltonian H(0), and\nthe Zeeman Hamiltonian is the perturbation:\nH = H(0) + δHfs\n|\n{z\n}\n\nH(0)\n+δHZeeman .\n(2.5.5)\n(2) Strong-field Zeeman effect: B ≫Bint. In this case the Zeeman effect is much larger\nthan fine structure effects. Accordingly, the original Hamiltonian H(0) together with\nthe Zeeman Hamiltonian are thought as the \"known\" Hamiltonian ˇH(0) and the fine\nstructure Hamiltonian Hfs is viewed as the perturbation:\nH = H(0) + δHZeeman\n|\n{z\n}\nˇ\nH(0)\n+δHfs .\n(2.5.6)\nYou may thing that H(0) + δHZeeman does not qualify as known, but happily, as we\nwill confirm soon, this is actually a very simple Hamiltonian.\nWhen the Zeeman magnetic field is neither weak nor strong, we must take the sum\nof the Zeeman and fine structure Hamiltonians as the perturbation. No simplification is\npossible and one must diagonalize the perturbation.\nWeak-field Zeeman effect. The approximate eigenstates of H(0) are the coupled states\n|nljmj⟩that exhibit fine structure corrections and whose energies are a function of n and j,\nas shown in the Fine Structure diagram. Degeneracies in this spectrum occur for different\nvalues of land different values of mj.\nTo figure out the effect of the Zeeman interaction on this spectrum we consider the\nmatrix elements:\n⟨nljmj|δHZeeman|nl′jm′\nj⟩.\n(2.5.7)\nSince δHZeeman ∼Lz + 2Sz we see that δHZeeman commutes with L2 and with ˆJz. The\nmatrix element thus vanishes unless l′ = land m′\nj = mj and the Zeeman perturbation is\ndiagonal in the degenerate fine structure eigenspaces. The energy corrections are therefore\nE(1)\nnljmj =\neħ\n2mc B ⟨nljmj|(ˆLz + 2 ˆSz)|nljmj⟩1\nħ,\n(2.5.8)\nwhere we multiplied and divided by ħto make the units of the result manifest. The result\nof the evaluation of the matrix element will show a remarkable feature: a linear dependence\n\n2.5. ZEEMAN EFFECT\nE(1) ∼ħmj on the azimuthal quantum numbers. The states in each j multiplet split into\nequally separated energy levels!\nWe will try to understand this result as a property of\nmatrix elements of vector operators. First, however, note that ˆLz + 2 ˆSz = ˆJz + ˆSz and\ntherefore the matrix element of interest in the above equation satisfies\n⟨nljmj|(ˆLz + 2 ˆSz)|nljmj⟩= ħm + ⟨nljmj| ˆSz|nljmj⟩.\n(2.5.9)\nIt follows that we only need to concern ourselves with ˆSz matrix elements.\nLet's talk about vector operators.\nThe operator ˆV is said to be a vector operator\nunder an angular momentum operator ˆJ if the following commutator holds for all values of\ni, j = 1, 2, 3:\nˆJi , ˆVj\n\n= iħoijk ˆVk .\n(2.5.10)\nIt follows from the familiar ˆJ commutators that ˆJ is a vector operator under ˆJ. Additionally,\nif ˆV is a vector operator it has a standard commutation relation with ˆJ2 that can be quickly\nconfirmed:\n[ˆJ2 , ˆV] = 2iħ\nˆV × ˆJ -iħˆV\n\n.\n(2.5.11)\nIf ˆV is chosen to be ˆJ the left-hand side vanishes by the standard property of ˆJ2 and the\nright-hand side vanishes because the ˆJ commutation relations can be written as ˆJ×ˆJ = iħˆJ.\nFinally, by repeated use of the above identities you will show (homework) that the following\nformula holds\n(2iħ)2\nh\nˆJ2 , [ˆJ2 , ˆV]\ni\n= ( ˆV · ˆJ) ˆJ -\nˆJ2 ˆV + ˆV ˆJ2\n.\n(2.5.12)\nConsider (ˆJ2, ˆJz) eigenstates |k; jmj⟩where k stands for other quantum number that bear\nno relation to angular momentum. The matrix elements of the left-hand side of (2.5.12) on\nsuch eigenstates is necessarily zero:\n⟨k′; jm′\nj|\nh\nˆJ2 , [ˆJ2 , ˆV]\ni\n|k; jmj⟩= 0 ,\n(2.5.13)\nas can be seen by expanding the outer commutator and noticing that ˆJ2 gives the same\neigenvalue when acting on the bra and on the ket. Therefore the matrix elements of the\nright-hand side gives\n⟨k′; jm′\nj|( ˆV · ˆJ) ˆJ|k; jmj⟩= ħ2 j(j + 1) ⟨k′; jm′\nj| ˆV|k; jmj⟩,\n(2.5.14)\nwhich implies that\n⟨k′; jm′\nj| ˆV|k; jmj⟩=\n⟨k′; jm′\nj|( ˆV · ˆJ) ˆJ|k; jmj⟩\nħ2 j(j + 1)\n.\n(2.5.15)\nThis is the main identity we wanted to establish. Using the less explicit notation ⟨· · · ⟩for\nthe matrix elements we have found that\n⟨ˆV⟩= ⟨( ˆV · ˆJ) ˆJ ⟩\n⟨ˆJ2⟩\n.\n(2.5.16)\n\nCHAPTER 2. HYDROGEN ATOM FINE STRUCTURE\nThis is sometimes called the projection lemma: the matrix elements of a vector operator ˆV\nare those of the conventional projection of ˆV onto ˆJ. Recall that the projection of a vector\nv along the vector j is (v · j)j/j2.\nLet us now return to the question of interest; the computation of the the expectation\nvalue of ˆSz in (2.5.20). Since ˆS is a vector operator under ˆJ we can use (2.5.15). Specializing\nto the z-component\n⟨nljmj| ˆSz|nljmj⟩=\nħmj ⟨nljmj|ˆS · ˆJ |nljmj⟩\nħ2 j(j + 1)\n.\n(2.5.17)\nWe already see the appearance of the predicted ħmj factor. The matrix element in the\nnumerator is still to be calculated but it will introduce no mj dependence. In fact ˆS · ˆJ is a\nscalar operator (it commutes with all ˆJi) and therefore it is diagonal in mj. But even more\nis true; the expectation value of a scalar operator is in fact independent of mj! We will not\nshow this here, but will just confirm it by direct computation. Since ˆL = ˆJ -ˆS we have\nˆS · ˆJ =\nˆJ2 + ˆS2 -ˆL2\n,\n(2.5.18)\nand therefore\n⟨nljmj| ˆSz|nljmj⟩=\nħmj\n2j(j + 1)\nj(j + 1) -l(l+ 1) + 3\n\n.\n(2.5.19)\nIndeed, no further mj dependence has appeared. Back now to (2.5.20) we get\n⟨nljmj|(ˆLz + 2 ˆSz)|nljmj⟩= ħmj\n\n1 + j(j + 1) -l(l+ 1) + 3\n2j(j + 1)\n\n.\n(2.5.20)\nThe constant of proportionality in parenthesis is called the Lande g-factor gJ(l):\ngJ(l) ≡1 + j(j + 1) -l(l+ 1) + 3\n2j(j + 1)\n(2.5.21)\nWe finally have for the Zeeman energy shifts in (2.5.8)\nE(1)\nnljmj =\neħ\n2mc B gJ(l) mj .\n(2.5.22)\nHere the Bohr magneton\neħ\n2mc ≃5.79 × 10-9eV/gauss. This is our final result for the weak-\nfield Zeeman energy corrections to the fine structure energy levels. Since all degeneracies\nwithin j multiplets are broken and j multiplets with different lsplit differently due to the\nldependence of gJ(l), the weak-field Zeeman effect removes all degeneracies!\nStrong-field Zeeman effect. We mentioned earlier that when the Zeeman effect is larger\nthan the fine structure corrections we must take the original hydrogen Hamiltonian together\nwith the Zeeman Hamiltonian to form the 'known' Hamiltonian ˇH(0):\nˇH(0) = H(0) +\ne\n2mc (ˆLz + 2 ˆSz)B .\n(2.5.23)\n\n2.5. ZEEMAN EFFECT\nActually ˇH(0) is simple because the Zeeman Hamiltonian commutes with the zero-th order\nhydrogen Hamiltonian\nˆLz + 2 ˆSz , H(0)\n= 0 .\n(2.5.24)\nWe can thus find eigenstates of both simultaneously. Those are in fact the uncoupled basis\nstates! We have\nH(0)|nlmlms⟩= E(0)\nn |nlmlms⟩\n(ˆLz + 2 ˆSz)|nlmlms⟩= ħ(ml+ 2ms)|nlmlms⟩.\n(2.5.25)\nand therefore the uncoupled basis states are the exact energy eigenstates of ˇH(0) and have\nenergies\nEnlmlms = E(0)\nn\n+ eħ\n2mcB(ml+ 2ms) .\n(2.5.26)\nSome of the degeneracy of H(0) has been removed, but some remains. For a fixed principal\nquantum number n there are degeneracies among l⊗1\n2 states and degeneracies among such\nmultiplets with land l′ different. This is illustrated in Figure 2.2.\nFigure 2.2: Illustrating the degeneracies remaining for l= 0 and l= 1 after the inclusion of Zeeman\nterm in the Hamiltonian. Accounting for the spin of the electron there two degenerate states in the\nl= 1 multiplet 1 ⊗1\n2 and each of the two states in the l= 0 multiplet 0 ⊗1\n2 is degenerate with a\nstate in the l= 1 multiplet.\nThe problem now is to compute the corrections due to δHfs on the non-degenerate and\non the degenerate subspaces of ˇH(0). The non-degenerate cases are straightforward, but\nthe degenerate cases could involve diagonalization. We must therefore consider the matrix\nelements\n⟨nl′m′\nlm′\ns| δHfs|nlmlms⟩,\n(2.5.27)\nwith the condition\nm′\nl+ 2m′\ns = ml+ 2ms ,\n(2.5.28)\n\nCHAPTER 2. HYDROGEN ATOM FINE STRUCTURE\nneeded for the two states in the matrix element to belong to a degenerate subspace. Since\nˆL2 commutes with δHfs the matrix elements vanish unless l= l′ and therefore it suffices to\nconsider the matrix elements\n⟨nl′m′\nlm′\ns| δHfs|nlmlms⟩,\n(2.5.29)\nstill with condition (2.5.28). Ignoring l= 0 states, we have to re-examine the relativistic\ncorrection and spin orbit. The relativistic correction was computed in the uncoupled basis\nand one can use the result because the states are unchanged and the perturbation was\nshown to be diagonal in this basis. For spin-orbit the calculation was done in the coupled\nbasis because spin-orbit is not diagonal in the original H(0) degenerate spaces using the\nuncoupled basis. But happily, it turns out that spin-orbit is diagonal in the more limited\ndegenerate subspaces obtained after the Zeeman effect is included. All these matters are\nexplored in the homework.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu\n8.06 Quantum Physics III\nSpring 2018\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: https://ocw.mit.edu/terms"

      "content": "Chapter 3\nSemiclassical approximation\nc⃝B. Zwiebach\n3.1\nThe classical limit\nThe WKB approximation provides approximate solutions for linear differential equations\nwith coefficients that have slow spatial variation. The acronym WKB stands for Wentzel,\nKramers, Brillouin, who independently discovered it in 1926.\nIt was in fact discovered\nearlier, in 1923 by the mathematician Jeffreys. When applied to quantum mechanics, it is\ncalled the semi-classical approximation, since classical physics then illuminates the main\nfeatures of the quantum wavefunction.\nThe de Broglie wavelength λ of a particle can help us assess if classical physics is relevant\nto the physical situation. For a particle with momentum p we have\nλ = h\np .\n(3.1.1)\nClassical physics provides useful physical insight when λ is much smaller than the relevant\nlength scale in the problem we are investigating. Alternatively if we take h →0 this will\nformally make λ →0, or λ smaller than the length scale of the problem. Being a constant of\nnature, we cannot really make ħ→0, so taking this limit is a thought experiment in which\nwe imagine worlds in which h takes smaller and smaller values making classical physics more\nand more applicable. The semi-classical approximation studied here will be applicable if\na suitable generalization of the de Broglie wavelength discussed below is small and slowly\nvarying. The semi-classical approximation will be set up mathematically by thinking of ħ\nas a parameter that can be taken to be as small as desired.\nOur discussion in this chapter will focus on one-dimensional problems. Consider there-\nfore a particle of mass m and total energy E moving in a potential V (x). In classical physics\nE -V (x) is the kinetic energy of the particle at x. This kinetic energy depends on position.\n\nCHAPTER 3. WKB AND SEMICLASSICAL APPROXIMATION\nSince kinetic energy is\np2\n2m this suggests the definition of the local momentum p(x):\np2(x) ≡2m(E -V (x)) .\n(3.1.2)\nThe local momentum p(x) is the momentum of the classical particle when it is located at\nx. With a notion of local momentum, we can define a local de Broglie wavelength λ(x)\nby the familiar relation:\nλ(x) ≡\nh\np(x) = 2πħ\np(x) .\n(3.1.3)\nThe time-independent Schr odinger equation\n-ħ2\n2m\n∂2\n∂x2 ψ(x) = (E -V (x))ψ(x) .\n(3.1.4)\ncan be written nicely in terms of the local momentum squared :\n-ħ2 ∂2\n∂x2 ψ = p2(x) ψ .\n(3.1.5)\nUsing the momentum operator, this equation takes the suggestive form\nˆp2 ψ(x) = p2(x) ψ(x) .\n(3.1.6)\nThis has the flavor of an eigenvalue equation but it is not one: the action of the momentum\noperator squared on the wavefunction is not really proportional to the wavefunction, it is\nthe wavefunction multiplied by the 'classical' position-dependent momentum-squared.\nA bit of extra notation is useful. If we are in the classically allowed region, E > V (x)\nand p2(x) is positive. We then write\np2(x) = 2m(E -V (x)) = ħ2k2(x) ,\n(3.1.7)\nintroducing the local, real wavenumber k(x). If we are in the classically forbidden region,\nV (x) > E and p2(x) is negative. We then write\n-p2(x) = 2m(V (x) -E) = ħ2κ2(x) ,\n(3.1.8)\nintroducing the local, real κ(x).\nThe wavefunctions we use in the WKB approximation are often expressed in polar form.\nJust like any complex number z can be written as reiθ, where r and θ are the magnitude\nand phase of z, respectively, we can write the wavefunction in a similar way:\nΨ(x, t) =\np\nρ(x, t) exp\ni\nħS(x, t)\n\n.\n(3.1.9)\n\n3.2. WKB APPROXIMATION SCHEME\nWe are using here three-dimensional notation for generality. By definition, the functions\nρ(x, t) and S(x, t) are real.\nThe function ρ is non-negative and the function S(x, t) as\nwritten, has units of ħ. The name ρ(x, t) is well motivated, for it is in fact the probability\ndensity:\nρ(x, t) = |Ψ(x, t)|2 .\n(3.1.10)\nLet's compute the probability current. For this we begin by taking the gradient of the\nwavefunction\n∇Ψ = 1\n∇ρ\n√ρe\niS\nħ+ i\nħ∇S Ψ\n(3.1.11)\nWe then form:\nΨ∗∇Ψ = 1\n2∇ρ + i\nħρ∇S\n(3.1.12)\nThe current is given by\nJ = ħ\nm Im (Ψ∗∇Ψ) .\n(3.1.13)\nIt follows that\nJ = ρ∇S\nm .\n(3.1.14)\nThis formula implies that the probability current J is perpendicular to the surfaces of\nconstant S, the surfaces of constant phase in the wavefunction.\nIn classical physics a fluid with density ρ(x) moving with velocity v(x) has a current\ndensity ρv = ρ p\nm.\nComparing with the above expression for the quantum probability\ncurrent, we deduce that\np(x) ≃∇S .\n(3.1.15)\nWe use the ≃because this is an association that is not of general validity. Nevertheless,\nfor 'basic' WKB solutions we will see that the gradient of S is indeed the classical local\nmomentum! This association also holds for a free particle:\nExample. Consider a free particle with momentum p and energy E. Its wavefunction is\nΨ(x, t) = exp\nip · x\nħ\n-iEt\nħ\n\n.\n(3.1.16)\nHere we identify the function S as S = p · x -Et and therefore ∇S = p. In this case ∇S\nis equal to the momentum eigenvalue, a constant.\n3.2\nWKB approximation scheme\nOur aim here is to find approximate solutions for the wavefunction ψ(x) that solves the\ntime independent Schr dinger equation in one dimension. We wrote before the polar decom-\nposition (3.1.9) of the wavefunction. It will be easier to set the approximation scheme by\n\nCHAPTER 3. WKB AND SEMICLASSICAL APPROXIMATION\nusing a single complex function S(x) to represent the time-independent wavefunction ψ(x).\nFor this we use a pure exponential without any prefactor:\nψ(x) = exp\ni\nħS(x)\n\n,\nS(x) ∈C .\n(3.2.1)\nAs before S must have units of ħ. This S(x) here is a complex number, because wavefunc-\ntions are not in general pure phases. The real part of S, divided by ħ, is the phase of the\nwavefunction. The imaginary part of S(x) determines the magnitude of the wavefunction.\nLet us plug this into the Schr odinger equation (3.1.5):\n-ħ2 d2\ndx2\n\ne\ni\nħS(x)\n= p2(x)e\ni\nħS(x) .\n(3.2.2)\nLet us examine the left-hand side and take the two derivatives\n-ħ2 d2\ndx2\n\ne\ni\nħS(x)\n= -ħ2 d\ndx\ni\nħS′(x)e\ni\nħS(x)\n\n= -ħ2\niS′′\nħ\n-(S′)2\nħ2\n\ne\ni\nħS(x) .\n(3.2.3)\nBack into the differential equation and canceling the common exponential\n-ħ2\niS′′\nħ\n-(S′)2\nħ2\n\n= p2(x) .\n(3.2.4)\nWith minor rearrangements we get our final form:\n(S′(x))2 -iħS′′(x) = p2(x) .\n(3.2.5)\nThe presence of an explicit iin the equation tells us that the solution for S, as expected,\ncannot be real. At first sight one may be baffled: we started with the linear Schr odinger\nequation for ψ and obtained a nonlinear equation for S! This is actually unavoidable when\nthe variable ψ is parameterized as an exponential and reminds us that sometimes a change\nof variables can turn a linear equation into a nonlinear one and viceversa. The nonlinear\nequation (3.2.5) allows us set up an approximation scheme in which ħis considered small\nand thus the term involving S′′(x) is small. We will argue that this is in fact true for slowly\nvarying potentials.\nClaim: iħS′′ small if V (x) is slowly varying.\nIndeed, if V (x) = V0 is a constant, then the local momentum p(x) is equal to a constant p0.\nEquation (3.2.5) is then solved by taking S′ = p0. For this choice S′′ = 0 and the term iħS′′\nvanishes identically for constant V . It should therefore be small for slowly varying V (x).\nAlternatively the term iħS′′ in the differential equation is small as ħ→0, which makes\nthe local de Broglie wavelength go to zero. In that case, the potential looks constant to the\nquantum particle.\n\n3.2. WKB APPROXIMATION SCHEME\nWe will thus take ħto be the small parameter in a systematic expansion of S(x):\nS(x) = S0(x) + ħS1(x) + ħ2S2(x) + O(ħ3) .\n(3.2.6)\nHere S0, just like S, has units of ħ. The next correction S1 has no units, and the following,\nS2 has units of one over ħ. Now plug this expansion into our nonlinear equation (3.2.5)\nS′\n0 + ħS′\n1 + ħ2S′\n2 + . . .\n2 -iħ\nS′′\n0 + ħS′′\n1 + ħ2S′′\n2 + . . .\n\n-p2(x) = 0 .\n(3.2.7)\nThe left-hand side is a power series expansion in ħ. Just as we argued for the parameter λ\nin perturbation theory, here we want the left-hand side to vanish for all values of ħand this\nrequires that the coefficient of each power of ħvanishes. We thus sort the left-hand side\nterms neglecting terms of order ħ2 or higher. We find\n(S′\n0)2 -p2 + ħ\n2S′\n0S′\n1 -iS′′\n\n+ O\nħ2\n= 0\n(3.2.8)\nThis gives two equations, one for the coefficient of (ħ)0 and another for the coefficient of ħ:\n(S′\n0)2 -p2(x) = 0 ,\n2S′\n0S′\n1 -iS′′\n0 = 0 .\n(3.2.9)\nThe first equation is easily solved:\nS′\n0 = ±p(x)\n→\nS0(x) = ±\nZ x\nx0\np(x′)dx′\n(3.2.10)\nwhere x0 is a constant of integration to be adjusted. The next equation allows us to find\nS1 which is in fact imaginary:\nS′\n1 = i\nS′′\nS′\n= i\n(±p′(x))\n(±p(x)) = i\np′\np .\n(3.2.11)\nThis is readily solved to give\ni S1(x) = -1\n2 ln p(x) + C′ .\n(3.2.12)\nLet us now reconstruct the wavefunction to this order of approximation:\nψ(x) = exp\ni\nħ(S0 + ħS1 + O(ħ2))\n\n≃exp\ni\nħS0\n\nexp [iS1]\n(3.2.13)\nUsing our results for S0 and S1 we have that the approximate solution is\nψ(x) = exp\n\n± i\nħ\nZ x\nx0\np(x′)dx′\n\nexp\n\n-1\n2 log p(x) + C′\n.\n(3.2.14)\n\nCHAPTER 3. WKB AND SEMICLASSICAL APPROXIMATION\nWe thus have\nψ(x) =\nA\np\np(x)\nexp\n\n± i\nħ\nZ x\nx0\np(x′)dx′\n\n.\n(3.2.15)\nThis is the basic solution in the WKB approximation. We do not attempt to normalize this\nwavefunction because, in fact, the region of validity of this approximation is still unclear.\nObservables for the basic solution:\ni) Probability density:\nρ = ψ∗ψ = |A|2\np(x) =\n|A|2\nmv(x) ,\n(3.2.16)\nwhere v(x) is the local classical velocity. Note that ρ is higher where v is small as\nthe particle lingers in those regions and is more likely to be found there. This is an\nintuition we developed long ago and is justified by this result.\nii) Probability current: In the language of the polar decomposition (3.1.9) of the wave-\nfunction the basic solution corresponds to\nS(x) =\nZ x\nx0\np(x′)dx′\n(3.2.17)\nNote that, as anticipated below equation (3.1.15) the gradient of S in the basic solution\nis the local momentum. Recalling the result (3.1.14) for the current,\nJ = ρ 1\nm\n∂S\n∂x ,\n(3.2.18)\nand therefore,\nJ(x) = |A|2\np(x)\np(x)\nm\n= |A|2\nm .\n(3.2.19)\nThe fact that the current is a constant should not have taken us by surprise.\nA\nposition-dependent current for an energy eigenstate is not possible, as it would violate\nthe current conservation equation ∂xJ(x)+∂tρ = 0, given that ρ is time independent.\nWe con now write the general solutions that can be built from the basic solution and\napply to classically allowed and classically forbidden regions.\nOn the allowed region E -V (x) > 0 we write p2(x) = ħ2k2(x), with k(x) > 0 and hence the\ngeneral solution is a superposition of two basic solutions with waves propagating in opposite\ndirections:\nψ(x) =\nA\np\nk(x)\nexp\n\ni\nZ x\nx0\nk(x′)dx′\n\n+\nB\np\nk(x)\nexp\n\n-i\nZ x\nx0\nk(x′)dx′\n\n.\n(3.2.20)\n\n3.2. WKB APPROXIMATION SCHEME\nNote that the first wave, with coefficient A moves to the right while the second wave,\nwith coefficient B moves to the left. This can be seen by recalling that the above energy\neigenstate ψ(x) is accompanied by the time factor e-iEt/ħwhen forming a full solution of\nthe Schr odinger equation. Moreover, the first phase (accompanying A) grows as x grows,\nwhile the second phase becomes more negative as x grows.\nOn the forbidden region p2 = -ħ2κ2(x) so we can take p(x) = iκ(x) in the solution,\nwith κ > 0, to find\nψ(x) =\nC\np\nκ(x)\nexp\nZ x\nx0\nκ(x′)dx′\n\n+\nD\np\nκ(x)\nexp\n\n-\nZ x\nx0\nκ(x′)dx′\n\n(3.2.21)\nThe argument of the first exponential becomes more positive as x grows. Thus the first\nterm, with coefficient C, is an increasing function as x grows. The argument of the second\nexponential becomes more negative x grows. Thus the second term, with coefficient D, is\na decreasing function as x grows.\n3.2.1\nValidity of the approximation\nTo understand more concretely the validity of our approximations, we reconsider the ex-\npansion (3.2.8) of the differential equation:\n(S′\n0)2 -p2 + ħ\n2S′\n0S′\n1 -iS′′\n\n+ O\nħ2\n= 0\n(3.2.22)\nWe must have that the O (ħ) terms in the differential equation are much smaller, in magni-\ntude, than the O (1) terms. At each of these orders we have two terms that are set equal to\neach other by the differential equations. It therefore suffices to check that one of the O (ħ)\nterms is much smaller than one of the O (1) terms. Thus, for example, we must have\n|ħS′\n0S′\n1| ≪|S′\n0|2 .\n(3.2.23)\nCanceling one factor of |S′\n0| and recalling that |S′\n0| = |p| we have\n|ħS′\n1| ≪|p| .\n(3.2.24)\nFrom (3.2.11) we note that |S′\n1| ∼|p′/p| and therefore we get\nħp′\np\n≪|p| .\n(3.2.25)\nThere are two useful ways to think about this relation. First we write it as\nħ\np\n\ndp\ndx\n≪|p|\n→\nλ\ndp\ndx\n≪|p|\n(3.2.26)\nwhich tells us that the changes in the local momentum over a distance equal to the de\nBroglie wavelength are small compared to the momentum. Alternatively we write (3.2.25)\nas follows:\nħp′\np2\n≪1\n→\nħd\ndx\np\n≪1 .\n(3.2.27)\n\nCHAPTER 3. WKB AND SEMICLASSICAL APPROXIMATION\nThis now means\ndλ\ndx\n≪1 .\n(3.2.28)\nThe de Broglie wavelength must vary slowly. Note the consistency with units, the left-hand\nside of the inequality being unit free. More intuitive, perhaps, is the version obtained by\nmultiplying the above by λ\nλdλ\ndx\n≪λ .\n(3.2.29)\nThis tells us that the variation of the de Broglie wavelength λ over a distance λ must be\nmuch smaller that λ.\nIt is not hard to figure out what the above constraints tell us about the rate of change\nof the potential. Finally connect to the potential. Taking one spatial derivative of the\nequation p2 = 2m(E -V (x)) we get\n|pp′| = m\n\ndV\ndx\n\n→\n\ndV\ndx\n= 1\nm|pp′| .\n(3.2.30)\nMultiplying by the absolute value of λ = h/p\nλ(x)\n\ndV\ndx\n= 2πħ\nm |p′| ≪p2\nm ,\n(3.2.31)\nwhere the last inequality follows from (3.2.25). Hence, we find that\nλ(x)\n\ndV\ndx\n≪\np2\n2m .\n(3.2.32)\nThe change in the potential over a distance equal to the de Broglie wavelength must be\nmuch smaller than the kinetic energy. This is the precise meaning of a slowly changing\npotential in the WKB approximation.\nThe slow variation conditions needed for the basic WKB solutions to be accurate fail\nnear turning points. This could be anticipated since at turning points the local momentum\nbecomes zero and the de Broglie wavelength becomes infinite. Under general conditions,\nsufficiently near a turning point the potential V (x) is approximately linear, as shown in\nFigure 3.1. We then have\nV (x) -E = g(x -a) ,\ng > 0 .\n(3.2.33)\nIn the allowed region x < a the local momentum is\np2 = 2m((E -V (x)) = 2mg(a -x) .\n(3.2.34)\n\n3.3. CONNECTION FORMULA\nFigure 3.1: The slow-varying conditions in WKB are violated at turning points.\nAs a result, the de Broglie wavelength is given by\nλ(x) = 2πħ\np\n=\n2πħ\n√2mg√a -x .\n(3.2.35)\nTaking a derivative, we find\ndλ\ndx\n=\nπħ\n√2mg\n(a -x)3/2 .\n(3.2.36)\nThe right-hand side goes to infinity as x →a and therefore the key condition (3.2.28) is\nviolated as we approach turning points. Our basic WKB solutions can be valid only as\nlong as we remain away from turning points. If we have a turning point, such as x = a in\nthe figure, we need a 'connection formula' that tells us how a solution far to the left and a\nsolution far to the right of the turning point are related when they together form a single\nsolution. We will consider a connection formula right below.\n3.3\nConnection formula\nLet us first explain and then use a set of connection formulae, leaving their derivation for\nnext section. The connection formulae refer to solutions away from a turning point x = a\nseparating a classically allowed region to the left and a classically forbidden region to the\nright. This is the situation illustrated in Figure 3.2.\nFor such turning point at x = a the WKB solutions to the right are exponentials that\ngrow or decay and the WKB solutions to the left are oscillatory functions. They connect\n\nCHAPTER 3. WKB AND SEMICLASSICAL APPROXIMATION\nFigure 3.2:\nconsistent with the following relations\np\nk(x)\ncos\nZ a\nx\nk(x′)dx′ -π\n\n⇐=\np\nκ(x)\nexp\n\n-\nZ x\na\nκ(x′)dx′\n\n(3.3.1)\n-\np\nk(x)\nsin\nZ a\nx\nk(x′)dx′ -π\n\n=⇒\np\nκ(x)\nexp\nZ x\na\nκ(x′)dx′\n\n(3.3.2)\nIn the first relation the arrow tells us that if the solution is a pure decaying exponential to\nthe right of x = a the solution to the left of x = a is accurately determined and given by\nthe phase-shifted cosine function the arrow points to. The second relation says that if the\nsolution to the left of x = a is of an oscillatory type, the growing part of the solution to\nthe right of x = a is accurately determined and given by the exponential the arrow points\nto. The decaying part cannot be reliably determined. As we will elaborate upon later, any\nconnection formula is not to be used in the direction that goes against the arrow.\nExample:\nFind a quantization condition for the energies of bound states in a monoton-\nically increasing potential V (x) that has a hard wall at x = 0. Assume V (x) increases\nwithout bound, as illustrated in Figure 3.3.\nLet E denote the energy of our searched-for eigenstate. Clearly, the energy and the\npotential V (x) determine the turning point x = a. The solution for x > a must only have a\ndecaying exponential since the forbidden region extends forever to the right of x = a. The\nwavefunction for x > a is therefore of the type on the right-side of the connection formula\n(3.3.1). This means that we have an accurate representation of the wavefunction to the left\nof x = a. Adjusting the arbitrary normalization, we have\nψ(x) =\np\nk(x)\ncos\nZ a\nx\nk(x′)dx′ -π\n\n,\n0 ≤x ≪a .\n(3.3.3)\n\n3.3. CONNECTION FORMULA\nFigure 3.3: A monotonically increasing potential with a hard wall at x = 0. For an energy eigenstate\nof energy E the turning point is at x = a.\nSince we have a hard wall, the wavefunction must vanish for x = 0. The condition ψ(0) = 0\nrequires that\ncos ∆= 0 ,\nwith\n∆=\nZ a\nk(x′)dx′ -π\n4 .\n(3.3.4)\nThis is satisfied when\n∆=\nZ a\nk(x′)dx′ -π\n4 =\nπ\n2 + nπ ,\nn ∈Z .\n(3.3.5)\nThe quantization condition is therefore\nZ a\nk(x′)dx′ =\nn + 3\n\nπ ,\nn = 0, 1, 2, . . . .\n(3.3.6)\nNegative integers are not allowed because the left-hand side is manifestly positive. The\nabove is easy to use in practice. Using the expression for k(x) in terms of E and V (x) we\nhave\nZ a\nr\n2m\nħ2 (E -V (x′)) dx′ =\nn + 3\n\nπ ,\nn = 0, 1, 2, . . .\n(3.3.7)\nIn some special cases a can be calculated in terms of E and the integral can be done\nanalytically. More generally, this is done numerically, exploring the value of the integral\non the left hand side as a function of E and selecting the energies for which it takes the\nquantized values on the right-hand side.\n\nCHAPTER 3. WKB AND SEMICLASSICAL APPROXIMATION\nLet us rewrite the wavefunction using\nR a\nx =\nR a\n0 -\nR x\n0 :\nψ(x) =\np\nk(x)\ncos\nZ a\nk(x′)dx′ -π\n4 -\nZ x\nk(x′)dx′\n\n=\np\nk(x)\ncos\n\n∆-\nZ x\nk(x′)dx′\n\n= sin ∆\np\nk(x)\nsin\nZ x\nk(x′)dx′\n\n,\n(3.3.8)\nwhere we expanded the cosine of a sum of angles and recalled that cos ∆= 0. In this form\nit is manifest that the wavefunction vanishes at x = 0. More interestingly, the quantization\ncondition (3.3.6) indicates that the excursion of the phase in the solution from 0 to a is a\nbit higher than nπ (but less than (n + 1)π). Thus the WKB wavefuntion produces the n\nnodes the n-th excited state must have, even though this wavefunction is not reliable all to\nway to x = a.\n3.4\nAiry functions and connection formulae\n(3.4.9)\nV (x) -E ≃g(x -a)\nwith g > 0 for x ∼a\n(3.4.10)\nSolutions\nψ(x) =\nA\np\nκ(x)\nexp\n\n-\nZ x\na\nκ(x′)dx′\n\n+\nB\np\nκ(x)\nexp\nZ x\na\nκ(x′)dx′\n\nx ≫a\n(3.4.11)\nψ(x) =\nC\np\nk(x)\nexp\n\ni\nZ a\nx\nk(x′)dx′\n\n+\nD\np\nk(x)\nexp\n\n-i\nZ a\nx\nk(x′)dx′\n\nx ≪a\n(3.4.12)\n\n3.4.

The formulas are in reality only usable in one direction with partial\nresults. Some terminology helps. We always speak having in mind a fixed turning point. If\nwe say we have a growing exponential at a turning point we mean we have a solution that\ngrows as we move away from the turning point towards the classically forbidden region.\nSimilarly, a decaying exponential means our solution decays as we move away from the\nturning point towards the classically forbidden region. In summary the connection arrow\ncan go from a decaying exponential into an oscillatory solution and can go from an oscilla-\ntory solution into a growing exponential.\n3.4.2\nThe other connection conditions\nThis time the turning point is at x = b, with the classically allowed region to the right of it\nand the classically forbidden region to the left of it.\np\nκ(x)\nexp\n\n-\nZ b\nx\nκ(x′)dx′\n\n=⇒\np\nk(x)\ncos\nZ x\nb\nk(x′)dx′ -π\n\n(3.4.45)\n-\np\nκ(x)\nexp\nZ b\nx\nκ(x′)dx′\n\n⇐=\np\nk(x)\nsin\nZ x\nb\nk(x′)dx′ -π\n\n(3.4.46)\nFor the first relation, if there is only a decaying exponential to the left, the wavefunction\nis definitely without the growing exponential, and the wavefunction to the right of x = b is\naccurately determined. This does not work in the reverse direction because a small error in\nthe oscillatory function would give a growing exponential to the left of for x = b that would\novertake the predicted decaying solution.\nFor the second relation, the stated direction (from right to left) is reliable: an small\nerror on the right side of x = b would produce a decaying exponential, thus a small error\non the left-side of x = b. The reverse direction does not work: a small error to the left of\nx = b, a decaying exponential, would produce a large error in the right-hand side.\n\n3.5. TUNNELLING THROUGH A BARRIER\nIn summary, in all cases of the connection conditions, relative to a turning point,\nWe can connect away from a decaying exponential and into a growing exponential.\n(3.4.47)\n3.5\nTunnelling through a barrier\nFigure 3.4: Tunneling in the WKB approximation. The energy E must be smaller than the height\nof the potential, and the barrier must be wide and smooth.\nWe want to find the tunneling probability T for a wave of energy incident on a smoothly\nvarying wide barrier. The energy E of the wave must be smaller than the height of the\npotential. In this problem there is an incident wave, a reflected wave and a transmitted\nwave, and the associated WKB expressions will have amplitudes controlled by constants\nA, B, and F, respectively. The situation is illustrated in Figure 3.4.\nRemarks:\n1) Expect T to be small. Little probability flux goes through and |A| ≈|B|.\n2) For x ≫b there is just an outgoing wave with amplitude controlled by F.\n3) Within the barrier the component that decays as x grows is more relevant that the\ncomponent that grows. It is the only component that can be estimated reliably.\nConsider the transmitted right-moving wave valid for x ≫b\nψtr(x) =\nF\np\nk(x)\nexp\n\ni\nZ x\nb\nk(x′)dx′ -iπ\n\n,\nx ≫b .\n(3.5.1)\nThis is a WKB solution with an extra phase of π/4 chosen to make the argument of the\nexponential have the familiar form appearing in the connection formulae. Expanding the\n\nCHAPTER 3. WKB AND SEMICLASSICAL APPROXIMATION\nexponential\nψtr(x) =\nF\np\nk(x)\ncos\nZ x\nb\nk(x′)dx′ -π\n\n+\niF\np\nk(x)\nsin\nZ x\nb\nk(x′)dx′ -π\n\n, x ≫b . (3.5.2)\nThis is in standard form. We can now match the second term to an exponential that grows\nas we move to the left of x = b, by using (3.4.46)\nψ(x)barr = -\niF\np\nκ(x)\nexp\nZ b\nx\nκ(x′)dx′\n\n,\na ≪x ≪b .\n(3.5.3)\nThe subscript 'barr' indicates a solution in the barrier region. If we attempted to match\nthe first term in (3.5.2) we would get an exponential that decays as we move to the left of\nx = b and it is unreliable given the growing exponential. We can now refer this solution to\nthe point x = a\nψ(x)barr = -\niF\np\nκ(x)\nexp\nZ b\na\nκ(x′)dx′ -\nZ x\na\nκ(x′)dx′\n\na ≪x ≪b .\n(3.5.4)\nDefining\nθ ≡\nZ b\na\nκ(x′)dx′\n(3.5.5)\nwe have\nψ(x)barr = -iFeθ\np\nκ(x)\nexp\n\n-\nZ x\na\nκ(x′)dx′\n\na ≪x ≪b .\n(3.5.6)\nSince this is a decaying exponential to the right of x > a we can connect it to a solution to\nthe left of x < a using (3.3.1)\nψ(x) = -2iFeθ\np\nk(x)\ncos\nZ a\nx\nk(x′)dx′ -π\n\n.\n(3.5.7)\nThis is a superposition of two waves, a wave ψinc incident on the barrier and a wave ψref\nreflected from the barrier. The incident part is\nψinc(x) = -iFeθ\np\nk(x)\nexp\n\n-i\nZ a\nx\nk(x′)dx′ + iπ\n\n.\n(3.5.8)\nThe sign in front of the integral may seem unusual for a wave moving to the right, but\nit is correct because the argument x appears in the lower limit of the integration. The\ntransmission coefficient T is the ratio of the transmitted probability current over the incident\nprobability current. Given the result in (3.2.19) we have\nT =\nprobability current for ψtr\nprobability current for ψinc\n=\n|F|2\n| -iFeθ|2 = e-2θ .\n(3.5.9)\n\n3.5. TUNNELLING THROUGH A BARRIER\nThis is the well-known exponential suppression of the transmission coefficient. Using the\nearlier definition of θ the result is\nTwkb = exp\n\n-2\nZ b\na\nκ(x′)dx′\n.\n(3.5.10)\nWe added the subscript 'wkb' to emphasize that this is the WKB approximation to the\nexact transmission coefficient. The integral extends in between the two turning points and\ncaptures information about the height and the width of the barrier. The integrand, as well\nas the turning points, depend on the energy as we can display by using the explicit value\nof κ(x) :\nTwkb = exp\n\n-2\nZ b\na\nr\n2m\nħ2 (V (x′) -E) dx′\n.\n(3.5.11)\nThe WKB approximation only captures the exponentially decaying part of the transmission\ncoefficient. There are corrections that are written as a prefactor to the exponential. These\nare not determined in this approximation.\nExample. Use the WKB approximation to estimate the transmission probability T for the\nrectangular barrier\nV (x) =\n(\nV0\nfor |x| < a ,\n0 ,\notherwise.\n(3.5.12)\nAssume the barrier is large. In terms of the familiar unit-free constant z0 used to characterize\nsquare wells, this means that\nz2\n0 ≡2mV0a2\nħ2\n≫1 .\n(3.5.13)\nLarge barrier means large z0 or large V0a2. Moreover we assume E smaller than V0; we\ncannot expect the approximation to work as the energy approaches the top of the barrier.\nCompare the WKB result for T with the exact result.\nSolution. The WKB estimation, using (3.5.11) is immediate. Since the barrier extends\nfrom x = -a to x = a and the potential is constant we have\nTwkb = exp\n\n-2\nZ a\n-a\nr\n2m\nħ2 (V0 -E) dx′\n.\n(3.5.14)\nThe integral can be done and we find\nTwkb = exp\n\n-4a\nħ\np\n2m(V0 -E)\n\n.\n(3.5.15)\nThis is the answer in the WKB approximation. In terms of z0 this reads\nTwkb ≃exp\n\n-4z0\nr\n1 -E\nV0\n\n.\n(3.5.16)\n\nCHAPTER 3. WKB AND SEMICLASSICAL APPROXIMATION\nThe validity of the WKB approximation requires the argument in the exponent to be large.\nThis is why we need z0 ≫1 and the energy not to approach V0. When E is very small\ncompared to V0, we have\nT ∼exp(-4z0) .\n(3.5.17)\nSince z0 ∼a√V0, this result is the basis for the claim that the exponential suppression of\nthe tunneling probability is proportional to the width of the well and the square root of its\nheight.\nThe exact formula for the tunneling probability of a square barrier has been calculated\nbefore, and it is given by\nT\n= 1 +\nV 2\n4E(V0 -E) sinh22a\nħ\np\n2m(V0 -E)\n\n.\n(3.5.18)\nThis formula will allow us to confirm the WKB exponential suppression and to find the\nprefactor. Under the conditions z0 ≫1 and V0 -E finite, the argument of the sinh function\nis large so this function can be replaced by its growing exponential (sinh x ∼1\n2ex):\nT\n≃1 +\nV0\n16E(1 -E\nV0 ) exp\n4a\nħ\np\n2m(V0 -E)\n\n,\n(3.5.19)\nwhere we also replaced V0 -E →V0 in the prefactor. The additive unit on the right-hand\nside can be neglected and we have\nT ≃16 E\nV0 (1 -E\nV0 ) exp\n\n-4a\nħ\np\n2m(V0 -E)\n\n.\n(3.5.20)\nThis result gives the same in exponential suppression as the WKB result (3.5.15). It also\ngives us a good approximation to the prefactor.\nThe WKB approximation is often used for the estimation of lifetimes. The physical\nsituation is represented in Figure 3.5. We have a particle of mass m and energy E localized\nbetween the turning points x = a and x = b of the potential. The classical particle cannot\nescape because of the energy barrier stretching from x = b to x = c. The quantum particle,\nhowever, can tunnel. The state of the quantum particle when localized between a and b\nis not strictly an energy eigenstate because the wavefunction for any energy eigenstate is\nnonzero for x > c. Our goal is to determine the lifetime τ of the particle. This is done by\nusing some classical estimates as well as the quantum transmission probability.\nWe first show that the lifetime τ is the inverse of B, the tunneling probability per unit\ntime. To see this we examine the function P(t) that represents the probability to have the\nparticle localized within [a, b] at time t, if it was there at t = 0. The lifetime is said to be τ\nif P(t) has the time dependence P(t) = e-t/τ. To see that we have such a situation when\nthe tunneling rate B is constant note that\nP(t + dt) = P(t) ·\nprobability that it does not tunnel in the next dt\n\n.\n(3.5.21)\n\n3.5. TUNNELLING THROUGH A BARRIER\nFigure 3.5: Estimating the lifetime of a particle with energy E temporarily localized in x ∈[a, b].\nTherefore\nP(t + dt) = P(t) ·\n1 -Bdt\n\n→\nP(t + dt) -P(t) = -BP(t) dt .\n(3.5.22)\nWe thus have the differential equation, and solution,\ndP\ndt\n= -B P(t)\n→\nP(t) = e-Bt ,\n(3.5.23)\nfrom which we identify, as claimed, that\nτ =\nB .\n(3.5.24)\nThe tunneling rate B or tunneling probability per unit time is estimated by counting the\nnumber of times nhit the classical particle, bouncing between x = a and x = b, hits the\nbarrier at x = b per unit time, and multiplying this number by the tunneling probability T:\nB = nhit T =\nT\n∆t ,\n(3.5.25)\nwhere ∆t is the time the classical particle takes to go from b to a and back to b:\n∆t = 2\nZ b\na\ndx\nv(x) = 2m\nZ b\na\ndx\np(x) .\n(3.5.26)\nWe now can put all the pieces together, using the WKB approximation for T. We find\nτ = ∆t\nT ≃2m\nZ b\na\ndx\np(x) · exp\n\nZ c\nb\nκ(x)dx\n\n.\n(3.5.27)\nThe smaller the tunneling probability, the larger the lifetime of the localized state. Note\nthat the factor ∆t carries the units of the result. The above result can easily fail to be\naccurate, as the WKB approximation for T does not give the prefactor multiplying the\nexponential suppression.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu\n8.06 Quantum Physics III\nSpring 2018\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: https://ocw.mit.edu/terms"

      "content": "Chapter 4\nTime Dependent Perturbation\nTheory\nc⃝B. Zwiebach\n4.1\nTime dependent perturbations\nWe will assume that, as before, we have a Hamiltonian H(0) that is known and is time\nindependent. Known means we know the spectrum of energy eigenstates and the energy\neigenvalues. This time the perturbation to the Hamiltonian, denoted as δH(t) will be time\ndependent and, as a result, the full Hamiltonian H(t) is also time dependent\nH(t) = H(0) + δH(t) .\n(4.1.1)\nWhile H(0) has a well-defined spectrum, H(t) does not. Being time dependent, H(t) does\nnot have energy eigenstates.\nIt is important to remember that the existence of energy\neigenstates was predicated on the factorization of solutions Ψ(x, t) of the full Schr odinger\nequation into a space-dependent part ψ(x) and a time dependent part that turned out to be\ne-iEt/ħ, with E the energy. Such factorization is not possible when the Hamiltonian is time\ndependent. Since H(t) does not have energy eigenstates the goal is to find the solutions\n|Ψ(x, t)⟩directly. Since we are going to focus on the time dependence, we will suppress the\nlabels associated with space. We simply say we are trying to find the solution |Ψ(t)⟩to the\nSchr odinger equation\niħ∂\n∂t|Ψ(t)⟩=\nH(0) + δH(t)\n\n|Ψ(t)⟩.\n(4.1.2)\nIn typical situations the perturbation δH(t) vanishes for t < t0, it exists for some finite\ntime, and then vanishes for t > tf (see Figure 4.1). The system starts in an eigenstate of\nH(0) at t < t0 or a linear combination thereof. We usually ask: What is the state of the\nsystem for t > tf? Note that both initial and final states are nicely described in terms of\neigenstates of H(0) since this is the Hamiltonian for t < t0 and t > tf. Even during the\n\nCHAPTER 4. TIME DEPENDENT PERTURBATION THEORY\nFigure 4.1: Time dependent perturbations typically exist for some time interval, here from t0 to tf.\ntime when the perturbation is on we can use the eigenstates of H(0) to describe the system,\nsince these eigenstates form a complete basis, but the time dependence is very nontrivial.\nMany physical questions can be couched in this language. For example, assume we have\na hydrogen atom in its ground state. We turn on EM fields for some time interval. We can\nthen ask: What are the probabilities to find the atom in each of the various excited states\nafter the perturbation turned off?\n4.1.1\nThe interaction picture\nIn order to solve efficiently for the state |Ψ(t)⟩we will introduce the Interaction Picture of\nQuantum Mechanics. This picture uses some elements of the Heisenberg picture and some\nelements of the Schr odinger picture. We will use the known Hamiltonian H(0) to define\nsome Heisenberg operators and the perturbation δH will be used to write a Schr odinger\nequation.\nWe begin by recalling some facts from the Heisenberg picture. For any Hamiltonian,\ntime dependent or not, one can determine the unitary operator U(t) that generates time\nevolution:\n|Ψ(t)⟩= U(t)|Ψ(0)⟩.\n(4.1.3)\nThe Heisenberg operator ˆAH associated with a Schr odinger operator ˆAs is obtained by\nconsidering a rewriting of expectation values:\n⟨Ψ(t)| ˆAs|Ψ(t)⟩= ⟨Ψ(0)|U+(t) ˆAs U(t)|Ψ(0)⟩= ⟨Ψ(0)| ˆAH|Ψ(0)⟩,\n(4.1.4)\nwhere\nAH ≡U+(t) ˆAs U(t) .\n(4.1.5)\nThis definition applies even for time dependent Schr odinger operators. Note that the oper-\nator U+ brings states to rest:\nU+(t)|Ψ(t)⟩= U+(t)U(t)|Ψ(0)⟩= |Ψ(0)⟩.\n(4.1.6)\nIn our problem the known Hamiltonian H(0) is time independent and the associated unitary\ntime evolution operator U0(t) takes the simple form\nU0(t) = exp\n\n-iH(0)t\nħ\n\n.\n(4.1.7)\n\n4.1. TIME DEPENDENT PERTURBATIONS\nThe state |Ψ(t)⟩in our problem evolves through the effects of H(0) plus δH. Motivated\nby (4.1.6) we define the auxiliary ket\neΨ(t)\n\nas the ket |Ψ(t)⟩partially brought to rest\nthrough H(0):\neΨ(t)\n\n≡exp\niH(0)t\nħ\nΨ(t)\n\n.\n(4.1.8)\nExpect that Schr odinger equation for\neΨ(t)\n\nwill be simpler, as the above must have taken\ncare of the time dependence generated by H(0).

We have thus found the Schr odinger equation\niħd\ndt\neΨ(t)\n\n= f\nδH(t)\neΨ(t)\n\n.\n(4.1.11)\nwhere the operator f\nδH(t) is defined as\nf\nδH(t) ≡exp\niH(0)t\nħ\n\nδH(t) exp\n\n-iH(0)t\nħ\n\n.\n(4.1.12)\nNote that as expected the time evolution left in\neΨ(t)\n\nis generated by f\nδH(t) via a Schr odinger\nequation. The operator f\nδH(t) is nothing else but the Heisenberg version of δH generated\nusing H(0)! This is an interaction picture, a mixture of Heisenberg's and Schr odinger pic-\nture. While we have some Heisenberg(0) operators there is still a time dependent state\neΨ(t)\n\nand a Schr odinger equation for it.\n\nCHAPTER 4. TIME DEPENDENT PERTURBATION THEORY\nHow does it all look in an orthonormal basis? Let |n⟩be the complete orthonormal basis\nof states for H(0):\nH(0)|n⟩= En|n⟩.\n(4.1.13)\nThis time there is no need for a (0) superscript, since neither the states nor their energies\nwill be corrected (there are no energy eigenstates in the time-dependent theory). We then\nwrite an ansatz for our unknown ket:\neΨ(t)\n\n=\nX\nn\ncn(t)|n⟩.\n(4.1.14)\nHere the functions cn(t) are unknown. This expansion is justified since the states |n⟩form\na basis, and thus at all times they can be used to describe the state of the system. The\noriginal wavefunction is then:\nΨ(t)\n\n= exp\n\n-iH(0)t\nħ\neΨ(t)\n\n=\nX\nn\ncn(t) exp\n\n-iEnt\nħ\n\n|n⟩.\n(4.1.15)\nNote that the time dependence due to H(0) is present here. If we had δH = 0 the state\neΨ(t)\n\nwould be a constant, as demanded by the Schr odinger equation (4.1.11) and the\ncn(t) would be constants. The solution above would give the expected time evolution of the\nstates under H(0).\nTo see what the Schr odinger equation tells us about the functions cn(t) we plug the\nansatz (4.1.14) into (4.1.11):\niħd\ndt\nX\nm\ncm(t)|m⟩=\nf\nδH(t)\nX\nn\ncn(t)|n⟩\n(4.1.16)\nUsing dots for time derivatives and introducing a resolution of the identity on the right-hand\nside we find\nX\nm\niħ cm(t)|m⟩=\nX\nm\n|m⟩⟨m| f\nδH(t)\nX\nn\ncn(t)|n⟩\n=\nX\nm\n|m⟩\nX\nn\n⟨m| f\nδH(t)|n⟩cn(t)\n=\nX\nm,n\nf\nδHmn(t)cn(t)|m⟩.\n(4.1.17)\nHere we have used the familiar matrix element notation\nf\nδHmn(t) ≡⟨m| f\nδH(t)|n⟩.\n(4.1.18)\nEquating the coefficients of the basis kets |m⟩in (4.1.17) we get the equations\niħ cm(t) =\nX\nn\nf\nδHmn(t) cn(t) .\n(4.1.19)\n\n4.1. TIME DEPENDENT PERTURBATIONS\nThe Schr odinger equation has become an infinite set of coupled first-order differential equa-\ntions. The matrix elements in the equation can be simplified a bit by passing to un-tilde\nvariables:\nf\nδHmn(t) =\n\nm\nexp\niH(0)t\nħ\n\nδH(t) exp\n\n-iH(0)t\nħ\nn\n\n= exp\ni\nħ(Em -En)t\n\n⟨m|δH(t)|n⟩.\n(4.1.20)\nIf we define\nωmn ≡Em -En\nħ\n,\n(4.1.21)\nwe then have\nf\nδHmn(t) = eiωmntδHmn(t) .\n(4.1.22)\nThe coupled equations (4.1.19) for the functions cn(t) then become\niħ cm(t) =\nX\nn\neiωmntδHmn(t)cn(t) .\n(4.1.23)\n4.1.2\nExample (based on Griffiths Problem 9.3)\nConsider a two-state system with basis states |a⟩and |b⟩, eigenstates of H(0) with energies\nEa and Eb, respectively. Call\nωab ≡(Ea -Eb)/ħ.\n(4.1.24)\nNow take the perturbation to be a matrix times a delta function at time equal zero. Thus\nthe perturbation only exists for time equal zero:\nδH(t) =\nα\nα∗\n\nδ(t) ≡U δ(t) ,\n(4.1.25)\nwhere α is a complex number. With the basis vectors ordered as |1⟩= |a⟩and |2⟩= |b⟩we\nhave\nU =\nUaa\nUab\nUba\nUbb\n\n,\nwith\nUaa = Ubb = 0 and Uab = U∗\nba = α .\n(4.1.26)\nThere is a sudden violent perturbation at t = 0 with off-diagonal elements that should\nproduce transition. Take the system to be in |a⟩for t = -inf, what is the probability that\nit is in |b⟩for t = +inf?\nSolution: First note that if the system is in |a⟩at t = -infit will remain in state |a⟩until\nt = 0-, that is, just before the perturbation turns on. This is because |a⟩is an energy\neigenstate of H(0). In fact we have, up to a constant phase,\n|Ψ(t)⟩= e-iEat/ħ|a⟩,\nfor\n-inf< t ≤0-.\n(4.1.27)\n\nCHAPTER 4. TIME DEPENDENT PERTURBATION THEORY\nWe are asked what will be the probability to find the state in |b⟩at t = inf, but in fact, the\nanswer is the same as the probability to find the state in |b⟩at t = 0+. This is because the\nperturbation does not exist anymore and if the state at t = 0+ is\n|Ψ(0+)⟩= γa|a⟩+ γb |b⟩,\n(4.1.28)\nwith γ1 and γ2 constants, then the state for any time t > 0 will be\n|Ψ(t)⟩= γa|a⟩e-iEat/ħ+ γb|b⟩e-iEbt/ħ.\n(4.1.29)\nThe probability pb(t) to find the state |b⟩at time t will be\npb(t) = |⟨b|Ψ(t)⟩|2 =\nγbe-iEbt/ħ = |γb|2 ,\n(4.1.30)\nand, as expected, this is time independent. It follows that to solve this problem we must\njust find the state at t = 0+ and determine the constants γ1 and γ2.\nSince we have two basis states the unknown tilde state is\neΨ(t)\n\n= ca(t)|a⟩+ cb(t)|b⟩,\n(4.1.31)\nand the initial conditions are stating that the system begins in the state |a⟩are\nca(0-) = 1 ,\ncb(0-) = 0 .\n(4.1.32)\nThe differential equations (4.1.23) take the form\niħ ca(t) = eiωabtδHab(t)cb(t) ,\niħ cb(t) = eiωbatδHba(t)ca(t) .\n(4.1.33)\nThe couplings are off-diagonal because δHaa = δHbb = 0. Using the form of the δH matrix\nelements,\niħ ca(t) = eiωabt α δ(t) cb(t) ,\niħ cb(t) = e-iωabt α∗δ(t) ca(t) .\n(4.1.34)\nWe know that for functions f continuous at t = 0 we have f(t)δ(t) = f(0)δ(t). We now\nask if we are allowed to use such identity for the right-hand side of the above equations. In\nfact we can use the identity for e±iωabt but not for the functions ca(t) and cb(t) that, are\nexpected to be discontinuous at t = 0. They must be so, because they can only change at\nt = 0, when the delta function exists. Evaluating the exponentials at t = 0 we then get the\nsimpler equations\niħ ca(t) = α δ(t) cb(t) ,\niħ cb(t) = α∗δ(t) ca(t) .\n(4.1.35)\n\n4.1. TIME DEPENDENT PERTURBATIONS\nWith such singular right-hand sides, the solution of these equations needs regulation. We\nwill regulate the delta function and solve the problem. A consistency check is that the\nsolution has a well-defined limit as the regulator is removed. We will replace the δ(t) by\nthe function ∆t0(t), with t0 > 0, defined as follows:\nδ(t) →∆t0(t) =\n(\n1/t0 ,\nfor t ∈[0, t0] ,\n0 ,\notherwise .\n(4.1.36)\nNote that as appropriate,\nR\ndt∆t0(t) = 1, and that ∆t0(t) in the limit as t0 →0 approaches\na delta function. If we replace the delta functions in (4.1.37) by the regulator we find, for\nt ∈[0, t0]\nFor t ∈[0, t0] :\niħ ca(t) =\nα\nt0\ncb(t) ,\niħ cb(t) = α∗\nt0\nca(t) .\n(4.1.37)\nFor any other times the right-hand side vanishes. By taking a time derivative of the first\nequation and using the second one we find that\nca(t) =\niħ\nα\nt0\niħ\nα∗\nt0\nca(t) = -\n|α|\nħt0\nca(t) .\n(4.1.38)\nThis is a simple second order differential equation and its general solution is\nca(t) = β0 cos\n|α|t\nħt0\n\n+ β1 sin\n|α|t\nħt0\n\n.\n(4.1.39)\nThis is accompanied with cb(t) which is readily obtained from the first line in (4.1.37):\ncb(t) = iħt0\nα ca(t) = i|α|\nα\n\n-β0 sin\n|α|t\nħt0\n\n+ β1 cos\n|α|t\nħt0\n\n.\n(4.1.40)\nThe initial conditions (4.1.32) tell us that in this regulated problem ca(0) = 1 and cb(0) = 0.\nGiven the solutions above, the first condition fixes β0 = 1 and the second fixes β1 = 0. Thus,\nour solutions are:\nFor t ∈[0, t0] :\nca(t) = cos\n|α|t\nħt0\n\n,\n(4.1.41)\ncb(t) = -i|α|\nα sin\n|α|t\nħt0\n\n.\n(4.1.42)\nWhen the (regulated) perturbation is turned off(t = t0), ca and cb stop varying and the\nconstant value they take is their values at t = t0. Hence\nca(t > t0) = ca(t0) = cos\n|α|\nħ\n\n,\n(4.1.43)\ncb(t > t0) = cb(t0) = -i|α|\nα sin\n|α|\nħ\n\n.\n(4.1.44)\n\nCHAPTER 4. TIME DEPENDENT PERTURBATION THEORY\nNote that these values are t0 independent. Being regulator independent, we can safely take\nthe limit t0 →0 to get\nca(t > 0) = cos\n|α|\nħ\n\n,\n(4.1.45)\ncb(t > 0) = -i|α|\nα sin\n|α|\nħ\n\n.\n(4.1.46)\nOur calculation above shows that at t = 0+ the state will be\n|Ψ(0+)⟩= |eΨ(0+)⟩= cos\n|α|\nħ\na\n\n-i|α|\nα sin\n|α|\nħ\nb\n\n.\n(4.1.47)\nWith only free evolution ensuing for t > 0 we have (as anticipated in (4.1.29))\n|Ψ(t)⟩= cos\n|α|\nħ\na\n\ne-iEat/ħ-i|α|\nα sin\n|α|\nħ\nb\n\ne-iEbt/ħ.\n(4.1.48)\nThe probabilities to be found in |a⟩or in |b⟩are time-independent, we are in a superposition\nof energy eigenstates! We can now easily calculate the probability pb(t) to find the system\nin |b⟩for t > 0 as well as the probability pa(t) to find the system in |a⟩for t > 0:\npb(t) = |⟨b|Ψ(t)⟩|2 = sin2\n|α|\nħ\n\n,\npa(t) = |⟨a|Ψ(t)⟩|2 = cos2\n|α|\nħ\n\n.\n(4.1.49)\nNote that pa(t)+pb(t) = 1, as required. The above is the exact solution of this system. If we\nhad worked in perturbation theory, we would be taking the strength |α| of the interaction\nto be small. The answers we would obtain would form the power series expansion of the\nabove formulas in the limit as |α|/ħis small.\n4.2\nPerturbative solution\nIn order to set up the perturbative expansion properly we include a unit-free small parameter\nλ multiplying the perturbation δH in the time-dependent Hamiltonian (4.1.1):\nH(t) = H(0) + λδH(t) .\n(4.2.1)\nWith such a replacement the interaction picture Schr odinger equation for |eΨ(t)⟩in (4.1.11)\nnow becomes\niħd\ndt\neΨ(t)\n\n= λ f\nδH(t)\neΨ(t)\n\n.\n(4.2.2)\nAs we did in time-independent perturbation theory we start by expanding\neΨ(t)\n\nin powers\nof the parameter λ:\neΨ(t)\n\n=\neΨ(0)(t)\n\n+ λ\neΨ(1)(t)\n\n+ λ2eΨ(2)(t)\n\n+ O\nλ3\n.\n(4.2.3)\n\n4.2. PERTURBATIVE SOLUTION\nWe now insert this into both sides of the Schr odinger equation (4.2.2), and using ∂t for time\nderivatives, we find\niħ∂t\neΨ(0)(t)\n\n+ λ iħ∂t\neΨ(1)(t)\n\n+ λ2 iħ∂t\neΨ(2)(t)\n\n+ λ3 iħ∂t\neΨ(2)(t)\n\n+ O\nλ4\n= λ f\nδH\neΨ(0)(t)\n\n+ λ2 f\nδH\neΨ(1)(t)\n\n+ λ3 f\nδH\neΨ(2)(t)\n\n+ O\nλ4\n.\n(4.2.4)\nThe coefficient of each power of λ must vanish, giving us\niħ∂t\neΨ(0)(t)\n\n= 0 ,\niħ∂t\neΨ(1)(t)\n\n=\nf\nδH\neΨ(0)(t)\n\n,\niħ∂t\neΨ(2)(t)\n\n=\nf\nδH\neΨ(1)(t)\n\n,\n...\n=\n...\niħ∂t\neΨ(n+1)(t)\n\n=\nf\nδH\neΨ(n)(t)\n\n.\n(4.2.5)\nThe origin of the pattern is clear. Since the Schr odinger equation has an explicit λ multi-\nplying the right-hand side, the time derivative of the n-th component is coupled to the f\nδH\nperturbation acting on the (n -1)-th component.\nLet us consider the initial condition in detail. We will assume that the perturbation\nturns on at t = 0, so that the initial condition is given in terms of |Ψ(0)⟩.\nSince our\nSchr odinger equation is in terms of |eΨ(t)⟩we use the relation ((4.1.8)) between them to\nconclude that both tilde and un-tilde wavefunctions are equal at t = 0:\n|eΨ(0)⟩= |Ψ(0)⟩.\n(4.2.6)\nGiven this, the expansion (4.2.3) evaluated at t = 0 implies that:\neΨ(0)\n\n= |Ψ(0)⟩=\neΨ(0)(0)\n\n+ λ\neΨ(1)(0)\n\n+ λ2eΨ(2)(0)\n\n+ O\nλ3\n.\n(4.2.7)\nThis must be viewed, again, as an equation that holds for all values of λ. As a result, the\ncoefficient of each power of λ must vanish and we have\neΨ(0)(0)\n\n=\nΨ(0)\n\n,\neΨ(n)(0)\n\n= 0 ,\nn = 1, 2, 3 . . . .\n(4.2.8)\nThese are the relevant initial conditions.\nConsider now the first equation in (4.2.5). It states that\neΨ(0)(t)\n\nis time independent.\nThis is reasonable: if the perturbation vanishes, this is the only equation we get and we\nshould expect\neΨ(t)\n\nconstant. Using the time-independence of\neΨ(0)(t)\n\nand the initial\ncondition we have\neΨ(0)(t)\n\n=\neΨ(0)(0)\n\n=\nΨ(0)\n\n,\n(4.2.9)\n\nCHAPTER 4. TIME DEPENDENT PERTURBATION THEORY\nand we have solved the first equation completely:\neΨ(0)\n=\nΨ(0)\n\n.\n(4.2.10)\nUsing this result, the O(λ) equation reads:\niħ∂t\neΨ(1)(t)\n\n= f\nδH\neΨ(0)(t)\n\n= f\nδH(t)\nΨ(0)\n\n.\n(4.2.11)\nThe solution can be written as an integral:\neΨ(1)(t)\n\n=\nZ t\nf\nδH(t′)\niħ\nΨ(0)\n\ndt′ .\n(4.2.12)\nNote that by setting the lower limit of integration at t = 0 we have implemented correctly\nthe initial condition |eΨ(1)(0)⟩= 0. The next equation, of order λ2 reads:\niħ∂t\neΨ(2)(t)\n\n= f\nδH\neΨ(1)(t)\n\n,\n(4.2.13)\nand its solution is\neΨ(2)(t)\n\n=\nZ t\nf\nδH(t′)\niħ\neΨ(1)(t′)\n\ndt′ ,\n(4.2.14)\nconsistent with the initial condition. Using our previous result to write\neΨ(1)(t′)\n\nwe now\nhave an iterated integral expression:\neΨ(2)(t)\n\n=\nZ t\nf\nδH(t′)\niħ\ndt′\nZ t′\nf\nδH(t′′)\niħ\nΨ(0)\n\ndt′′ .\n(4.2.15)\nIt should be clear from this discussion how to write the iterated integral expression for\neΨ(k)(t)\n\n, with k > 2. The solution, setting λ = 1 and summarizing is then\nΨ(t)\n\n= exp\n\n-iH(0)t\nħ\n\n|Ψ(0)⟩+ |eΨ(1)(t)⟩+ |eΨ(2)(t)⟩+ · · ·\n!\n(4.2.16)\nLet us use our perturbation theory to calculate the probability Pm←n(t) to transition\nfrom |n⟩at t = 0 to |m⟩, with m = n, at time t, under the effect of the perturbation. By\ndefinition\nPm←n(t) =\n⟨m|Ψ(t)⟩\n2 .\n(4.2.17)\nUsing the tilde wavefunction, for which we know how to write the perturbation, we have\nPm←n(t) =\n⟨m|e-iH(0)t/ħeΨ(t)\n2 =\n⟨m|eΨ(t)⟩\n2 ,\n(4.2.18)\n\n4.2.

PERTURBATIVE SOLUTION\n4.2.1\nExample NMR\nThe Hamiltonian for a particle with a magnetic moment inside a magnetic field can be\nwritten in the form\nH = ω · S ,\n(4.2.36)\nwhere S is the spin operator and ω is precession angular velocity vector, itself a function\nof the magnetic field.

The original spin state\nΨ(0)\n\nprecesses about the direction\nof ω with angular velocity ω.\nCase 2: Time dependent perturbation.\nSuppose that to the original Hamiltonian we\nadd the effect of a rotating magnetic field, rotating with the same angular velocity ω0 that\ncorresponds to the Larmor frequency of the original Hamiltonian:\nδH(t) = Ω\n\nˆSx cos ω0t + ˆSy sin ω0t\n\n.\n(4.2.45)\nTo compute the perturbation f\nδH we can use (4.2.42) with t replaced by -t so that the\nright-hand side of this equation is proportional to δH:\nexp\nh\n-iω0tσz\ni\nΩˆSx exp\nh\niω0tσz\ni\n= Ω\n\nˆSx cos ω0t + ˆSy sin ω0t\n\n.\n(4.2.46)\nMoving the exponentials on the left-hand side to the right-hand side we find\nΩˆSx = exp\nh\niω0tσz\ni\nΩ\n\nˆSx cos ω0t + ˆSy sin ω0t\n\nexp\nh\n-iω0tσz\ni\n.\n(4.2.47)\nThe right-hand side is, by definition, f\nδH.

A spin originally aligned along ˆz will spiral into\nthe x, y plane with angular velocity Ω.\n4.3\nFermi's Golden Rule\nLet us now consider transitions where the initial state is part of a discrete spectrum but the\nfinal state is part of a continuum. The ionization of an atom is perhaps the most familiar\nexample: the initial state may be one of the discrete bound states of the atom while the\nfinal state includes a free electron a momentum eigenstate that is part of a continuum of\nnon-normalizable states.\nAs we will see, while the probability of transition between discrete states exhibits pe-\nriodic dependence in time, if the final state is part of a continuum an integral over final\nstates is needed and the result is a transition probability linear in time. To such probability\nfunction we will be able to associate a transition rate. The final answer for the transition\nrate is given by Fermi's Golden Rule.\nWe will consider two different cases in full detail:\n1. Constant perturbations. In this case the perturbation, called V turns on at t = 0 but\nit is otherwise time independent:\nH =\n(\nH(0) ,\nfor t ≤0 ,\nH(0) + V\nfor t > 0 .\n(4.3.1)\nThis situation is relevant for the phenomenon of auto-ionization, where an internal\ntransition in the atom is accompanied by the ejection of an electron.\n\nCHAPTER 4. TIME DEPENDENT PERTURBATION THEORY\n2. Harmonic perturbations. In this case the time dependence of the perturbation δH is\nperiodic, namely,\nH(t) = H(0) + δH(t) ,\n(4.3.2)\nwith\nδH(t) =\n(\n0 ,\nfor t ≤0 ,\n2H′ cos ωt ,\nfor t > 0 .\n(4.3.3)\nNote the factor of two entering the definition of δH in terms of the time independent\nH′. This situation is relevant to the interaction of electromagnetic fields with atoms.\nBefore starting with the analysis of these two cases let us consider the way to deal\nwith continuum states, as the final states in the transition will belong to a continuum.\nThe fact is that we need to be able to count the states in the continuuum, so we will\nreplace infinite space by a very large cubic box of side length L and we will impose periodic\nboundary conditions on the wavefunctions. The result will be a discrete spectrum where\nthe separation between the states can be made arbitrarily small, thus simulating accurately\na continuum in the limit L →inf. If the states are energetic enough and the potential is\nshort range, momentum eigenstates are a good representation of the continuum.\nTo count states use a large box, which can be taken to be a cube of side L:\nWe call L a regulator as it allows us to deal with infinite quantities (like the volume of\nspace or the number of continuum states). At the end of our calculations the value of L\nmust drop out. This is a consistency check. The momentum eigenstates ψ(x take the form\nψ(x) =\n√\nL3 eikxxeikyyeikzz ,\n(4.3.4)\nwith constant k = (kx, ky, kz). It is clear that the states are normalized correctly\nZ\nbox\n|ψ(x)|2d3x = 1\nL3\nZ\nd3x = 1 .\n(4.3.5)\nThe k′s are quantized by the periodicity condition on the wavefunction:\nψ(x + L, y, z) = ψ(x, y + L, z) = ψ(x, y, z + L) = ψ(x, y, z) .\n(4.3.6)\nThe quantization gives\nkxL = 2πnx\n→\nLdkx = 2πdnx ,\nkyL = 2πny\n→\nLdky = 2πdny ,\nkzL = 2πnz\n→\nLdkz = 2πdnz .\n(4.3.7)\n\n4.3. FERMI'S GOLDEN RULE\nDefine ∆N as the total number of states within the little cubic volume element d3k. It\nfollows from (4.3.7) that we have\n∆N ≡dnx dny dnz =\nL\n2π\nd3k .\n(4.3.8)\nNote that ∆N only depends on d3k and not on k itself: the density of states is constant in\nmomentum space.\nNow let d3k be a volume element determined in spherical coordinates k, θ, φ and by\nranges dk, dθ, dφ. Therefore\nd3k = k2dk sin θdθ dφ = k2dk dΩ\n(4.3.9)\nWe now want to express the density of states as a function of energy. For this we take\ndifferentials of the relation between the wavenumber k and the energy E:\nE = ħ2k2\n2m\n→\nkdk = m\nħ2 dE .\n(4.3.10)\nBack in (4.3.9) we have\nd3k = k m\nħ2 dE dΩ,\n(4.3.11)\nhence\n∆N =\nL\n2π\nk m\nħ2 dΩdE .\n(4.3.12)\nWe now equate\n∆N = ρ(E)dE ,\n(4.3.13)\nwhere ρ(E) is a density of states, more precisely, it is the number of states per unit energy\nat around energy E and with momentum pointing within the solid angle dΩ. The last two\nequations determine for us this density:\nρ(E) =\nL3\n8π3\nm\nħ2 k dΩ.\n(4.3.14)\nWith a very large box, a sum over states can be replaced by an integral as follows\nX\nstates\n· · ·\n→\nZ\n· · · ρ(E)dE\n(4.3.15)\nwhere the dots denote an arbitrary function of the momenta k of the states.\n\nCHAPTER 4. TIME DEPENDENT PERTURBATION THEORY\n4.3.1\nConstant transitions.\nThe Hamiltonian, as given in (4.3.1) takes the form\nH =\n(\nH(0)\nfor t ≤0\nH(0) + V\nfor t > 0 .\n(4.3.16)\nWe thus identify δH(t) = V for t ≥0. Recalling the formula (4.2.33) for transition ampli-\ntudes to first order in perturbation theory we have\nc(1)\nm (t) =\nX\nn\nZ t\ndt′eiωmnt′ Vmn\niħcn(0) .\n(4.3.17)\nTo represent an initial state i at = 0 we take cn(0) = δn,i. For a transition to a final state\nf at time t0 we set m = f and we have an integral that is easily performed:\nc(1)\nf (t0) = 1\niħ\nZ t0\nVfi eiωfi t′dt′ = Vfi\niħ\neiωfi t′\niωfi\n\nt0\n(4.3.18)\nEvaluating the limits and simplifying\nc(1)\nf (t0) =\nVfi\nEf -Ei\n\n1 -eiωfi t0\n= Vfi eiωfit0/2\nEf -Ei\n(-2i) sin\nωfi t0\n\n.\n(4.3.19)\nThe transition probability to go from i at t = 0 to f at t = t0 is then |c(1)\nf (t0)|2 and is\ntherefore\nPf←i(t0) = |Vfi|2 4 sin2 ωfi t0\n\n(Ef -Ei)2\n.\n(4.3.20)\nThis first order result in perturbation theory is expected to be accurate at time t0 if\nPf←i(t0) ≪1. Certainly a large transition probability at first order could not be trusted\nand would require examination of higher orders.\nTo understand the main features of the result for the transition probability we examine\nhow it behaves for different values of the final energy Ef. If Ef = Ei the transition is said\nto be energy non-conserving. Of course, energy is conserved overall, as it would be supplied\nby the perturbation. If Ef = Ei we have an energy conserving transition. Both are possible\nand let us consider them in turn.\n1. Ef = Ei. In this case the transition probability Pf←i(t0) as a function of t0 is shown\nin Figure 4.2. The behavior is oscillatory with frequency |ωfi. If the amplitude of the\noscillation is much less than one\n4|Vfi|2\n(Ef -Ei)2 ≪1\n(4.3.21)\n\n4.3. FERMI'S GOLDEN RULE\nFigure 4.2: The transition probability as a function of time for constant perturbations.\nthen this first order transition probability Pf←i(t0) is accurate for all times t0 as it is\nalways small. The amplitude is suppressed as |Ef -Ei| grows, due to the factor in\nthe denominator. This indicates that the larger the energy 'violation' the smaller the\nprobability of transition. This is happening because a perturbation that turns on and\nthen remains constant is not an efficient supply of energy.\n2. Ef →Ei. In this limit ωfi approaches zero and therefore\nsin2\nωfi t0\n\n≃(Ef -Ei)2\n4ħ2\nt2\n0 .\n(4.3.22)\nIt follows from (4.3.20) that\nlim\nEf→Ei Pf←i(t0) = |Vfi|2\nħ2\nt2\n0 .\n(4.3.23)\nThe probability for an energy-conserving transition grows quadratically in time, and\ndoes so without bound! This result, however, can only be trusted for small enough t0\nsuch that Pf←i(t0) ≪1.\nNote that a quadratic growth of Pf←i is also visible in the energy non-conserving Ef =\nEi case for very small times t0. Indeed, (4.3.20) leads again to limt0→0 Pf←i(t0) =\n|Vfi|2t2\n0/ħ2, while Ef = Ei. This behavior can be noted near the origin in Figure 4.2.\nOur next step is to integrate the transition probability over the now discretized contin-\nuum of final states. Remarkably, upon integration the oscillatory and quadratic behaviors\nof the transition probability as a function of time will conspire to create a linear behavior!\nThe sum of transition probabilities over final states is approximated by an integral, as\nexplained in (4.3.15). We thus have\nX\nf\nPf←i(t0) =\nZ\nPf←i(t0)ρ(Ef)dEf = 4\nZ\n|Vfi|2 sin2 ωfi t0\n\n(Ef -Ei)2 ρ(Ef)dEf .\n(4.3.24)\n\nCHAPTER 4. TIME DEPENDENT PERTURBATION THEORY\nWe have noted that Pf←i in the above integrand is suppressed as |Ef -Ei| becomes large.\nWe therefore expect that the bulk of the contribution to the integral will occur for a narrow\nrange ∆Ef of Ef near Ei.\nLet us assume now that |Vfi|2 and ρ(Ef) are slow varying\nand therefore approximately constant over the narrow interval Ef (we will re-examine this\nassumption below). If this is the case we can evaluate them for Ef set equal to Ei and take\nthem out of the integrand to find\nX\nf\nPf←i(t0) = 4|Vfi|2\nħ2\nρ(Ef = Ei) · I(t0) ,\n(4.3.25)\nwhere the integral I(t0) is given by\nI(t0) ≡\nZ\nω2\nfi\nsin2\nωfi t0\n\ndEf = ħ\nZ\nsin2\nωfi t0\ndωfi\nω2\nfi\n.\n(4.3.26)\nAs it stands, the integral extends from minus infinity to plus infinity. It is useful to plot the\nfinal integrand for I(t0) as a function of the integration variable ωfi. The result is shown\nin Figure 4.3 and exhibits a main central lobe followed by symmetrically arranged lobes of\ndecreasing amplitude. The lobes are separated by zeroes occurring for ωfi = 2πk/t0, with\nk integer. Note that for\nFigure 4.3: Plot of\nω2\nfi sin2\nωfi t0\n\n, the integrand of I.\nThe largest contribution to I(t0) arises from the main lobe\n-2π\nt0\n< ωfi < 2π\nt0\n.\n(4.3.27)\nIn terms of energies this corresponds to the range\nEi -2πħ\nt0\n< Ef < Ei + 2πħ\nt0\n.\n(4.3.28)\n\n4.3. FERMI'S GOLDEN RULE\nWe need this range to be a narrow, thus t0 must be sufficiently large. The narrowness\nis required to justify our taking of the density of states ρ(E) and the matrix element |Vfi|2\nout of the integral. If we want to include more lobes this is can be made consistent with a\nnarrow range of energies by making t0 larger.\nThe linear dependence of I(t0) as a function of t0 is intuitively appreciated by noticing\nthat the height of the main lobe is proportional to t2\n0 and its width is proportional to 1/t0.\nIn fact, the linear dependence is a simple mathematical fact made manifest by a change of\nvariables. Letting\nu = ωfit0\n=⇒du = t0\n2 dωfi ,\n(4.3.29)\nso that\nI(t0) = 2ħ\nt0\nZ inf\n-inf\nsin2 u\nu2 · 4\nt2\n= ħt0\nZ inf\n-inf\nsin2 u\nu2\n,\n(4.3.30)\nmaking the linear dependence in t0 manifest. The remaining integral evaluates to π and we\nthus get\nI(t0) = π\n2 ħt0 .\n(4.3.31)\nHad restricted the integral to the main lobe, concerned that the density of states and matrix\nelements would vary over larger ranges, we would have gotten 90% of the total contribution.\nIncluding the next two lobes, one to the left and one to the right, brings the result up to\n95% of the total contribution. By the time we include ten or more lobes on each side we\nare getting 99% of the answer. For sufficiently large t0 is is still a narrow range.\nHaving determined the value of the integral I(t0) we can substitute back into our ex-\npression for the transition probability (4.3.26). Replacing t0 by t\nX\nk\nPk←i(t) = 4|Vfi|2\nħ2\nρ(Ef) π\n2 ħt = 2π\nħ|Vfi|2ρ(Ef) t .\n(4.3.32)\nThis holds, as discussed before, for sufficiently large t. Of course t cannot be too large as it\nwould make the transition probability large and unreliable. The linear dependence of the\ntransition probability implies we can define a transition rate w, or probability of transition\nper unit time, by dividing the transition probability by t:\nw ≡1\nt\nX\nf\nPf←i(t) .\n(4.3.33)\nThis finally gives us Fermi's golden rule for constant perturbations:\nFermi's golden rule:\nw = 2π\nħ|Vfi|2ρ(Ef) ,\nEf = Ei .\n(4.3.34)\nNot only is the density of states evaluated at the energy Ei, the matrix element Vfi is also\nevaluated at the energy Ei and other observables of the final state, like the momentum. In\n\nCHAPTER 4. TIME DEPENDENT PERTURBATION THEORY\nthis version of the golden rule the integration over final states has been performed. The\nunits are manifestly right: |Vfi|2 has units of energy squared, ρ has units of one over energy,\nand with an ħin the denominator the whole expression has units of one over time, as\nappropriate for a rate. We can also see that the dependence of w on the size-of-the-box\nregulator L disappears: The matrix element\nVfi = ⟨f|V |i⟩∼L-3/2 ,\n(4.3.35)\nbecause the final state wavefunction has such dependence (see (4.3.4)). Then the L depen-\ndence in |Vfi|2 ∼L-3 cancels with the L dependence of the density of states ρ ∼L3, noted\nin (4.3.14).\nLet us summarize the approximations used to derive the golden rule.\nWe have two\nconditions that must hold simultaneously:\n1. We assumed that t0 is large enough so that the energy range\nEi -k 2πħ\nt0\n< Ef < Ei + k 2πħ\nt0\n,\n(4.3.36)\nwith k some small integer, is narrow enough that ρ(E) and |Vfi|2 are approximately\nconstant over this range. This allowed us to take them out of the integral simplifying\ngreatly the problem and making a complete evaluation possible.\n2. We cannot allow t0 to be arbitrarily large. As we have\nX\nf\nPf←i(t0) = w t0 ,\n(4.3.37)\nwe must keep wt0 ≪1 for our first order calculation to be accurate.\nCan the two conditions on t0 be satisfied? There is no problem if the perturbation can\nbe made small enough: indeed, suppose condition 1 is satisfied for some suitable t0 but\ncondition 2 is not. Then we can make the perturbation V smaller making w small enough\nthat the second condition is satisfied. In practice, in specific problems, one could do the\nfollowing check. First compute w assuming the golden rule. Then fix t0 such that wt0 is\nvery small, say equal to 0.01. Then check that over the range ∼ħ/t0 the density of states\nand the matrix elements are roughly constant. If this works out the approximation should\nbe very good!\nHelium atom and autoionization.\nThe helium has two protons (Z = 2) and two\nelectrons. Let H(0) be the Hamiltonian for this system ignoring the the Coulomb repulsion\nbetween the electrons:\nH(0) =\np2\n2m -e2\nr1\n+\np2\n2m -e2\nr2\n.\n(4.3.38)\n\n4.3. FERMI'S GOLDEN RULE\nHere the labels 1 and 2 refer to each one of the two electrons.\nThe spectrum of this\nHamiltonian consists of hydrogenic states, with n1, n2 the principal quantum numbers for\nthe electrons. The energies are then\nEn1,n2 = -(13.6 eV)Z2\nn2\n+ 1\nn2\n\n= -(54.4 eV)\nn2\n+ 1\nn2\n\n.\n(4.3.39)\nFigure 4.4: Hydrogenic states in helium and continuum states of negative total energy.\nFor the hydrogen atom we have bound states of negative energy and continuum states\nof positive energy that can be described to a good approximation as momentum eigenstates\nof the electron which is no longer bound to the proton. Since we have two electrons in the\ncase of helium, there are continuum states in the spectrum with negative energy.\nThis first happens for n1 = 1 in the limit as n2 →inf. For n1 = 1 and n2 = infthe\nsecond electron is essentially free and contributes no energy. Thus a continuum appears for\nenergy E1,inf= -54.4eV. This (1S)(inf) continuum extends for all E ≥-54.4eV as the free\nelectron can have arbitrary positive kinetic energy. The state (2S)(inf) is the beginning of\na second continuum, also including states of negative energy. In general the state (nS)(inf)\nwith n ≥1 marks the beginning of the n-th continuum. In each of these continua one\nelectron is still bound and the other is free. A diagram showing some discrete states and a\ncouple of continua is given in Figure 4.4.\nSelf-ionizing energy-conserving transitions can occur because discrete states can find\nthemselves in the middle of a continuum. The state (2S)2, for example, with two electrons\non the 2S configuration and with energy E2,2 = -27eV is in the middle of the (1S)(inf)\ncontinuum. We can view the original (2S)2 hydrogenic state as a t = 0 eigenstate of H(0)\nand treat the Coulomb repulsion as a perturbation. We thus have a total Hamiltonian H\n\nCHAPTER 4. TIME DEPENDENT PERTURBATION THEORY\nthat takes the form\nH = H(0) + V ,\nV =\ne2\n|r1 -r2| .\n(4.3.40)\nThe perturbation V produces \"auto-ionizing\" Auger transitions to the continuum. We have\na transition from a state with energy E2,2 = -27eV to a state of one bound electron with\nenergy -54.4eV and one free electron with kinetic energy of 27eV. That final state is part\nof a continuum. Radiative transitions from (2S)2 to 1S2S, with photo-emission, are in fact\na lot less likely than auto-ionizing transitions!\nWe will not do the quantitative analysis required to determine lifetime of the (2S)2 state.\nIn general auto-ionization is a process in which an atom or a molecule in an excited state\nspontaneously emits one of the outer-shell electrons. Auto-ionizing states are in general\nshort lived. Auger transitions are auto-ionization processes in which the filling of an inner\nshell vacancy is accompanied by the emission of an electron. Our example of the (2S)2\nstate is an Auger transition. Molecules can have auto ionizing Rydberg states, in which the\nlittle energy needed to remove the Rydberg electron is supplied by a vibrational excitation\nof the molecule.\n4.3.2\nHarmonic Perturbation\nIt is now time to consider the case when the perturbation is harmonic. We will be able\nto derive a similar looking Fermi golden rule for the transition rate. The most important\ndifference is that now the transitions are of two types. They involve either absorption of\nenergy or a release of energy. In both cases that energy (absorbed or released) is equal to\nħω where ω is the frequency of the perturbation.\nAs indicated in (4.3.3) we have\nH(t) = H(0) + δH(t) ,\n(4.3.41)\nwhere the perturbation δH(t) takes the form\nδH(t) =\n(\n0 ,\nfor t ≤0 ,\n2H′ cos ωt ,\nfor t > 0 .\n(4.3.42)\nHere ω > 0 and H′ is some time independent Hamiltonian. The inclusion of an extra factor\nof two in the relation between δH and H′ is convenient because it results in a golden rule\ndoes not have additional factors of two compared to the case of constant transitions.\nWe again consider transitions from an initial state i to a final state f.

As t0 →0 each fraction goes to it0. For finite t0, which is our case of interest,\neach numerator is a complex number of bounded absolute value that oscillates in time\nfrom zero up to two. In comparing the two terms the relevant one is the one with the\nsmallest denominator.1\n- The first term is relevant as ωfi + ω ≈0, that is, when there are states at energy\nEf = Ei -ħω. This is \"stimulated emission\", the source has stimulated a transition\nin which energy ħω is released.\n- The second term relevant if ωfi -ω ≈0, that is, when there are states at energy\nEf = Ei + ħω. Energy is transferred from the perturbation to the system, and we\nhave a process of \"absorption\".\nBoth cases are of interest. Let us do the calculations for the case of absorption; the\nanswer for the case of spontaneous emission will be completely analogous. We take i to be\na discrete state, possibly bound, and f to be a state in the continuum at the higher energy\nEf ≈Ei + ħω. Since ωfi ≃ω, the second term in the last line of (4.3.44) is much more\nimportant than the first. Keeping only the second term we have\nc(1)\nf (t0) = -\nH′\nfi\nħ\ne\ni\n2 (ωfi-ω)t0\nωfi -ω\n2i sin\nωfi -ω\nt0\n\n,\n(4.3.45)\nand the transition probability is\nPf←i(t0) = |c(1)\nf (t0)|2 =\n4|H′\nfi|2\nħ2\nsin2 ωfi-ω\nt0\n\n(ωfi -ω)2\n(4.3.46)\nThe transition probability is exactly the same as that for constant perturbations (see\n(4.3.20)) with V replaced by H′ and ωfi replaced by ωfi -ω.

The one with larger amplitude is more\nrelevant even though at some special times, as it crosses the value of zero, it is smaller than the other wave.\n\nCHAPTER 4.

IONIZATION OF HYDROGEN\nFinally, the transition probability is\nX\nk\nPk←i(t0) = 2π\nħ|H′\nfi|2ρ(Ei + ħω) t0 .\n(4.3.53)\nThe transition rate w is finally given by\nFermi's golden rule:\nw = 2π\nħρ(Ef)|H′\nfi|2 ,\nEf = Ei + ħω .\n(4.3.54)\nHere H′(t) = 2H′ cos ωt. Equation (4.3.54) is known as Fermi's golden rule for the case of\nharmonic perturbations. For the case of spontaneous emission the only change required in\nthe above formula is Ef = Ei -ħω.\n4.4\nIonization of hydrogen\nWe aim to find the ionization rate for hydrogen when hit by the harmonically varying\nelectric field of an electromagnetic wave. We assume the hydrogen atom has its electron\non the ground state. In this ionization process a photon ejects the bound electron, which\nbecomes free.\nLet us first do a few estimates to understand the validity of the approximations that will\nbe required. If the electromagnetic field has frequency ω the incident photons have energy\nEγ = ħω .\n(4.4.1)\nThe energy Ee and the magnitude k of the momentum of the ejected electron are given by\nEe = ħ2k2\n2m = Eγ -Ry ,\n(4.4.2)\nwhere the Rydberg Ry is the magnitude of the energy of the ground state:\n2Ry = e2\na0\n=\nħ2\nma2\n= αħc\na0\n,\nRy ≃13.6 eV .\n(4.4.3)\nInequalities\n1. Any electromagnetic wave has spatial dependence. We can ignore the spatial depen-\ndence of the wave if the wavelength λ of the photon is much bigger than the Bohr\nradius a0:\nλ\na0\n≫1 .\n(4.4.4)\nSuch a condition puts an upper bound on the photon energy, since the more energetic\nphoton the smaller its wavelength. To bound the energy we first write\nλ = 2π\nkγ\n= 2πc\nω\n= 2πħc\nħω ,\n(4.4.5)\n\nCHAPTER 4. TIME DEPENDENT PERTURBATION THEORY\nand then find\nλ\na0\n= 2π\nħω\nħc\na0\n= 4π\nα\nRy\nħω ≃1722 Ry\nħω\n(4.4.6)\nThe inequality (4.4.4) then gives\nħω ≪1722 Ry ≃23 keV\n(4.4.7)\n2. For final states we would like to use free particle momentum eigenstates. This requires\nthe ejected electron to be energetic enough not to be much effected by the Coulomb\nfield. As a result, the photon to be energetic enough, and this constraint provides a\nlower bound for its energy. We have\nEe = Eγ -Ry ≫Ry\n→\nħω ≫Ry .\n(4.4.8)\nThe two inequalities above imply\nRy ≪ħω ≪1722 Ry .\n(4.4.9)\nIf consider that 1 ≪10 we could take\n140eV ≤ħω ≤2.3 keV .\n(4.4.10)\nNote that even for the upper limit the electron is non relativistic: 2.3 keV ≪mec2 ≃511keV.\nExercise: Determine ka0 in terms of ħω and Ry.\nSolution:\nħ2k2\n2m = ħω -Ry = Ry\nħω\nRy\n-1\n\n=\nħ2\n2ma2\nħω\nRy\n-1\n\n(4.4.11)\nk2a2\n0 = ħω\nRy\n-1\n→\nka0 =\ns\nħω\nRy\n-1 .\n(4.4.12)\nThis is the desired result. In the range of (4.4.10) we have\n3 ≤ka0 ≤13 .\n(4.4.13)\nCalculating the matrix element. Our perturbation Hamiltonian is\nδH = -eΦ ,\n(4.4.14)\nwhere Φ is the electric scalar potential. Let the electric field at the atom be polarized in\nthe ˆz direction\nE(t) = E(t)ˆz = 2E0 cos ωt ˆz\n(4.4.15)\n\n4.4. IONIZATION OF HYDROGEN\nThe associated scalar potential is\nΦ = -E(t)z ,\n(4.4.16)\nand therefore\nδH = eE(t)z = eE(t)r cos θ = 2 eE0r cos θ\n|\n{z\n}\nH′\ncos ωt ≡2H′ cos ωt\n(4.4.17)\nWe have thus identified, in our notation,\nH′ = eE0r cos θ .\n(4.4.18)\nWe want to compute the matrix element between an initial state |i⟩that is the ground state\nof hydrogen, and a final state |f⟩which is an electron plane wave with momentum ke. The\nassociated wavefunctions are\nFinal state:\nuk(x) =\nL3/2 eik·r\n(4.4.19)\nInitial state:\nψ0(r) =\np\nπa3\ne-r\na0\n(4.4.20)\nThe only physical angle here is that between the ejected electron momentum ke and the\nelectric field polarization E. We expect electron to be ejected maximally along E. This\nsuggests rearranging the axes to have the electron momentum along the z axis and and\nletting θ be the angle between the electron momentum and the electric field. The integration\nvariable r will have angles θ′, φ′, and the angle between the electric field and r is now called\nθ′′ as shown in the figure, so that H′ = eE0r cos θ′′:\n⟨f|H′|i⟩=\nZ\nd3x\nL3/2 eik·r eE0r cos θ′′\np\nπa3\ne-r\na0\n=\neE0\np\nπa3\n0L3\nZ\nr2dr sin θ′dθ′dφ′eikr cos θ′r cos θ′′e-r\na0\n(4.4.21)\n\nCHAPTER 4. TIME DEPENDENT PERTURBATION THEORY\nThe main complication with doing the integral is the factor cos θ′′. The dot product of unit\nvectors along E and n is cos θ′′:\ncos θ′′ = (sin θ cos φ)(sin θ′ cos φ′) + (sin θ sin φ)(sin θ′ sin φ′) + cos θ cos θ′\n= sin θ sin θ′ cos(φ -φ′) + cos θ cos θ′\n(4.4.22)\nSince the following integral vanishes\nZ\ndφ′ cos(φ -φ′) = 0\n(4.4.23)\nthe first term in the expression for cos θ′′ will vanish upon φ′ integration. We therefore can\nreplace cos θ′′ →cos θ cos θ′ to find\n⟨f|H′|i⟩=\neE0\np\nπa3\n0L3\nZ\nr3dr sin θ′dθ′dφ′eikr cos θ′ cos θ cos θ′e-r\na0\n=\neE0\np\nπa3\n0L3 (cos θ)(2π)\nZ\nr3dr e-r\na0\nZ 1\n-1\nd(cos θ′) cos θ′eikr cos θ′\n(4.4.24)\nNow let r = a0u and do the radial integration:\n⟨f|H′|i⟩=\neE0\np\nπa3\n0L3 2π cos θa4\nZ 1\n-1\nd(cos θ′) cos θ′\nZ\nu3du e-u(1+ika0 cos θ′)\n=\neE0\np\nπa3\n0L3 2π cos θa4\nZ 1\n-1\nd(cos θ′) cos θ′\n3!\n(1 + ika0 cos θ′)4 .\n(4.4.25)\nWriting x = cos θ′ the angular integral is not complicated:\n⟨f|H′|i⟩=\neE0\np\nπa3\n0L3 2π cos θa4\n3!\n(ika0)4\nZ 1\n-1\nx\n\nx +\nika0\n4 dx\n=\neE0\np\nπa3\n0L3 2π cos θa4\n3!\n(ika0)4\n\nika0\n\n1 +\nk2a2\n= -i32πeE0a0\np\nπa3\n0L3\nka4\n(1 + k2a2\n0)3 cos θ\n(4.4.26)\nHence, with a little rearrangement\n⟨f|H′|i⟩= -i32√π (eE0a0)\nka4\np\na3\n0L3\n(1 + k2a2\n0)3 cos θ .\n(4.4.27)\nThe above matrix element has the units of (eE0a), which is energy. This is as expected.\nSquaring we find\n|H′\nfi|2 = 1024 π (eE0a)2 k2a5\nL3\ncos2 θ\n(1 + k2a2\n0)6\n(4.4.28)\n\n4.4. IONIZATION OF HYDROGEN\nAt this point, with θ the angle between ke and E, it is more convenient to align E along\nthe z-axis and let ke be defined by the polar angles θ, φ. The density of states was given in\n(4.3.14)\nρ(Ee) = L3\n8π3\nm\nħ2 k dΩ\n(4.4.29)\nso that using Fermi's Golden rule, the rate dw to go into final states in the solid angle dΩ\nis\ndw = 2π\nħρ(Ee)|H′\nfi|2\n= 2π\nħ\nL3\n8π3\nm\nħ2 k dΩ1024π(eE0a0)2 k2a5\nL3\ncos2 θ\n(1 + k2a2\n0)6 .\n(4.4.30)\nIt follows that\ndw\ndΩ= 256\nπ\nma2\nħ2\n(eE0a0)2\nħ\nk3a3\n(1 + k2a2\n0)6 cos2 θ .\n(4.4.31)\ndw\ndΩis the probability of ionization per unit time and per unit solid angle. All the ejected\nelectrons will have the same momentum ħk. Note that the units have worked out: w ∼\n[E]2\nħ\n·\n[E] ∼\nT as expected. In here 2E0 is the peak amplitude of the electric field in the\nwave. The cos2 θ implies that the electron tends to be ejected in the direction of the electric\nfield.\nThe total ionization probability per unit time is obtained by integration over solid angle.\nUsing\nZ\ncos2 θ dΩ= 1\n3 4π ,\n(4.4.32)\nand recalling that\nħ2\nma2\n0 = 2Ry\nw =\nZ\ndΩdw\ndΩ= 512\n(eE0a0)2\nħRy\nk3a3\n(1 + k2a2\n0)6 .\n(4.4.33)\nFor the window of validity (4.4.13) we have 9 ≤(ka0)2 ≤169, and we neglect the \"one\" in\nthe denominator to get\nw = 512\n(eE0a0)2\nħRy\n(ka0)9 .\n(4.4.34)\nThis is our final answer. For numerical calculations it is useful to note the atomic units in\nwhich the answer takes the form\nw = 256\nEp\nE∗\n2 1\nt∗\n(ka0)9 .\n(4.4.35)\n\nCHAPTER 4. TIME DEPENDENT PERTURBATION THEORY\nHere Ep = 2E0 is the peak amplitude of the electric field. Moreover, the atomic electric\nfield E∗and the atomic time t∗are given by\nE∗= 2Ry\nea0\n= e\na2\n= 5.14 × 1011V/m\nt∗= a0\nαc = 2.42 × 10-17 sec.\n(4.4.36)\nNote that E∗is the electric field of a proton at a distance a0 while t∗is the time it takes\nthe electron to travel a distance a0 at the velocity αc in the ground state. A laser intensity\nof 3.55 × 1016W/cm2 has an peak electric field of magnitude E∗.\n4.5\nLight and atoms\n4.5.1\nAbsorption and stimulated emission\nThe physical problem we are trying to solve consists of a collection of atoms with two\npossible energy levels interacting with light at a temperature T. We want to understand\nthe processes of absorption and emission of radiation and how they can produce thermal\nequilibrium.\nLet us first consider a single atom and the possible processes. Consider two possible\nlevels of an electron in an atom\nDefine\nωab ≡Eb -Ea\nħ\n.\nImagine now shining light into the atom at a frequency ωab. There are two possibilities\ndepending on the initial state of the atom:\n(i) Electron initially in |a⟩: there will be an absorption rate at which a photon is absorbed\nand the electron goes from |a⟩→|b⟩.\n(ii) Electron initially in |b⟩: there will be a stimulated emission rate at which the photon\nfield stimulates an electronic transition |b⟩→|a⟩with the release of an additional\nphoton.\n\n4.5. LIGHT AND ATOMS\nThese processes are illustrated in the figure below:\nA LASER, Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation, works by having pop-\nulation inversion, namely most of the atoms are in the excited energy level. Then any small\nnumber of photons can trigger larger and larger numbers of stimulated emission processes!\n4.5.2\nEinstein's Argument\nAtoms in states a or b with Eb > Ea, with populations Na and\nNb respectively. The atoms are in equilibrium with a bath of\nphotons all at temperature T. Einstein discovered a number\nof relations from the condition of equilibrium.\nFact 1: Equilibrium values for populations:\nNa = Nb = 0\n(4.5.1)\nFact 2: Equilibrium populations governed by thermal distribu-\ntion\nNa\nNb\n= e-βEb\ne-βEa = e-βħωab ,\nβ ≡\nkbT\n(4.5.2)\n\nCHAPTER 4. TIME DEPENDENT PERTURBATION THEORY\nFact 3: For a thermal blackbody, the energy U(ω)dω per unit\nvolume in the frequency range dω is known to be\nU(ω)dω =\nħ\nπ2c3\nω3dω\neβħω -1\n(4.5.3)\nProcess\nRate\nAbsorption:\n|a⟩→|b⟩\nBabU(ωba)Na\nphoton absorbed\nStimulated emission:\n|b⟩→|a⟩\nBbaU(ωba)Nb\nphoton released\nIn the table above we have indicated the two obvious processes: absorption and stim-\nulated emission. The rate indicated is the number of transitions per unit time. For ab-\nsorption, this rate is proportional to the number Na of atoms in the ground state, capable\nof absorbing a photon, times U(ωab) which captures the information about the number of\nphotons available, times a B coefficient Bab that we want to determine. For stimulated\nemission, the rate is proportional to the number Nb of atoms in the excited state, thus\ncapable of emitting a photon, times U(ωab) times a B coefficient Bba. The inclusion of\nU(ωab) reflects the \"stimulated\" character of the transition.\nCan we make this work, that is, can we achieve equilibrium? We will see that we cannot.\nWith the two processes above, the rate of change of Nb is\nNb = rate absorption -rate stimulated emission\n(4.5.4)\nAt equilibrium Nb = 0, hence\n0 = Nb = BabU(ωba)Na -BbaU(ωba)Nb\n= (BabNa -BbaNb)U(ωba)\n0 = Na\n\nBab -Bbae-βħωba\n\nU(ωba)\n(4.5.5)\nThis is a strange result: in order to have equilibrium we need Bab -Bbae-βħωba = 0. The\nB coefficients, however, depend on the electronic configurations in the atom and not on\nthe temperature T. Thus this cancellation is not possible for arbitrary temperature. We\nalso note that the photon energy density does not feature in the equilibrium condition. In\nconclusion, equilibrium is not possible.\nWhat are we missing? Another process: spontaneous emission!!, an emission rate that\ndoes not depend on the thermal photons. The rate is proportional to the number of atoms\nNb in the excited state, with a coefficient of proportionality called A:\n\n4.5. LIGHT AND ATOMS\nProcess\nRate\nSpontaneous emission:\n|b⟩→|a⟩\nANb\nphoton released\nReconsider now the equilibrium condition with this extra contribution to Nb:\n0 = Nb = BabU(ωba)Na -BbaU(ωba)Nb -ANb\n=⇒A =\n\nBab\nNa\nNb\n-Bba\n\nU(ωba)\n=⇒U(ωba) =\nA\nBab\neβħωba -Bba\nBab\n(4.5.6)\nThe equilibrium condition indeed gives some important constraint on U(ωab). But from Eq.\n(4.5.3) we know\nU(ωba) = ħω3\nba\nπ2c3\neβħωba -1\n(4.5.7)\nHence comparing the two equations we get\nBab = Bba\nand\nA\nBab\n= ħω3\nba\nπ2c3\n(4.5.8)\nAs we'll see, we'll be able to calculate Bab, but A is harder. Happily, thanks to (4.5.8), we\ncan obtain A from Bab.\nSpontaneous emission does not care about U(ωba); the photons flying around. At a\ndeep level one can think of spontaneous emission as stimulated emission due to vacuum\nfluctuation of the EM field.\nFor a given atomic transition expect stimulated emission rate to dominate at higher\ntemperature, the there are more photons around. Spontaneous emission should dominate\nat very low temperature. Indeed from (4.5.6)\nA\nBabU(ωba) = exp\nħωba\nkbT\n\n-1\n\nCHAPTER 4. TIME DEPENDENT PERTURBATION THEORY\n4.5.3\nAtom/light interaction\nFocus on E field.\nEffects of B are weaker by O\nv\nc\n\n∼α. For optical frequencies λ ∼\n4000 -8000 A and since a0 ≃0.5 A, we can ignore the spatial dependence of the field (even\nfor ionization frequencies\nλ\na0 ∼1700)\nElectric field at the atom\nE(t) = E(t)n = 2E0 cos(ωt)n\nwhere n is the direction of the field.\nΦ(r, t) = -r · E(t) ,\n∇Φ = -E\n(4.5.9)\nas expected. The perturbation is therefore\nδH = +qΦ(r) = -qr · E(t)\n(4.5.10)\nBy defining the dipole moment d as d ≡qr, we can rewrite the perturbation as\nδH = -d · E(t) = -d · n2E0 cos(ωt) = 2(-d · nE0) cos(ωt) .\n(4.5.11)\nSince we defined δH = 2H′ cos ωt we can read\nH′ = -d · n E0 .\n(4.5.12)\nRecall that to first order in perturbation theory Pb←a(t) = Pa←b(t) so let's consider just\nPa←b(t), the stimulated emission process, from (4.3.46)\nPa←b(t) = 4|H′\nab|2\nħ2\nsin2 ωba-ω\nt\n\n(ωba -ω)2\n= 4E2\n0|(d · n)ab|2\nħ2\nsin2 ωba-ω\nt\n\n(ωba -ω)2\n(4.5.13)\nNow think in terms of energy.

LIGHT AND ATOMS\nThe superposition of light is incoherent, so we will add probabilities of transition due to\neach component of light. For this we must turn a sum of electric field intensities into an\nintegral.\nX\ni\nE2\n0(ωi) = 2π\nZ\nU(ω)dω\n(4.5.16)\nwhere U(ω) is the energy density per unit frequency. In this way the transition rate in\nterms of energy reads\nPa←b(t) = |(d · n)ab|2\nħ2\n2π\nZ\nU(ω)dω sin2 ωba-ω\nt\n\n(ωba -ω)2\n= |(d · n)ab|2\nħ2\n(2π)U(ωab)\nZ\ndω sin2 ωba-ω\nt\n\n(ωba -ω)2\n(4.5.17)\nAs usual, take x ≡\nωba-ω\nt\n\n=⇒dω = 2dx\nt , so that (4.5.17) is\nt · t2\nZ sin2 x\nx2\ndx = 2tπ\n(4.5.18)\nRa←b = 4π2\nħ2 |(d · n)ab|2U(ωba)\n(4.5.19)\nSo far we have two vectors: d which depends on the atom geometry and n which is the\ndirection of the electric field.

The hamiltonian of the system would be\np\nH(x, p, ω(t)) =\n+ mω2(t)x\n(1.1)\n2m\nwhere x and p are going to be functions of time.\nIn general\ndH\n∂H\n∂H\n∂H\n=\nx +\np +\n.\n(1.2)\ndt\n∂x\n∂p\n∂t\nHamilton's equation of motion read\n∂H\n∂H\n=\n= -\n(1.3)\nx ,\np .\n∂p\n∂x\n\nEven if you are not familiar with these, you probably know well their quantum analogs:\n\nd hxi\n∂H\nd hxi\n∂H\ni~ dt = h[x, H]i = i~\n\n∂p\n→\ndt =\n∂p\n\nd hpi\ni~ dt = h[p, H]i =\n∂H\n-i~ ∂x\n→\nd hpi\ndt = - ∂H\n∂x\n(1.4)\nAt any rate, equations (1.3) imply that the first two terms in the right-hand side of (1.2) vanish and\nwe have\ndH\n∂H\n=\n= mω\n.\nωx2\n(1.5)\ndt\n∂t\nWe have an adiabatic change if the time scale τ for change is much greater than time scale of the\noscillation, T = 2π .\nω(t)\nWhat remains roughly constant as ω(t) changes adiabatically?\nH(t)\nClaim:\nI(t) ≡\nis almost constant in adiabatic changes of ω.\n(1.6)\nω(t)\nI(t) is called the adiabatic invariant.\nLet us see why this is so:\n\ndI\ndH\n\np\n- H(t)\nmω\n=\nω\nω =\nω\nωx2 -\n+ mω2(t)x\nω\n=\nω2\nω2\ndt\ndt\n2m\n\nω\np2\nω\n=\nmω2(t)x 2 -\n=\n(V (t) - K(t)) ,\n(1.7)\nω2\n2m\nω2\nwhere V and K are the potential and kinetic energies, respectively. We want to understand why this\nright-hand side is small. Clearly, ω is slowly varying if ω is slowly varying, but the term in parenthesis\nω2\nis actually quickly varying. Indeed, with\nx = A sin ωt and p = Amω cos ωt\nthen the parenthesis goes like\n\n1 mω2 x 2 - p\n∼ 1 mω2(sin2 ωt - cos 2 ωt) ∼-1 mω2 cos 2ωt ,\n(1.8)\n2m\n\nwhich is a fast variation. Let us see, however, how much I(t) changes over one period\nZ\nZ\nt+T\nt+T\ndI\nω\n\nI(t + T ) - I(t) =\ndt0 =\n(t0) V (t0) - K(t0) dt0\n(1.9)\ndt0\nω2\nt\nt\nSince ω(t) is slowly varying, it changes very little over a period T and we can take the factor ω/ω out\nof the integral:\nZ t+T\nI(t + T ) - I(t) ' ω (t)\n(V (t) - K(t)) dt0\n(1.10)\nω2\nt\nIn harmonic motion with ω constant, the average over a period of the potential energy V (t) is exactly\nequal to the average of the kinetic energy K(t), and the two terms above would cancel exactly. When\nω is slowly changing they roughly cancel\nI(t + T ) - I(t) ' ω(t)\nω2 · 0 ' 0\n(1.11)\nWhat is the geometrical interpretation of the adiabatic invariant E/ω? For this we consider the\nmotion of a classical oscillator in phase space (x, p) where periodic oscillations trace the ellipse defined\nby energy conservation:\np\n+ mω2 x = E\n(ω, E, constants)\n2m\nWe quickly see that the semi-major and semi-minor axes have lengths\nr\n2E\n√\na =\nmω2\nand b =\n2mE\n(1.12)\nTherefore\nE\nArea of the ellipse = πab = 2π ω\n(1.13)\nThe adiabatic invariant is proportional to the area of the ellipse. That's neat! We can rewrite the\narea as an integral that takes a familiar form:\nI\nArea of the ellipse =\np dx\n\nwhere we integrate over the whole closed trajectory with the orientation shown in the picture so that\nthe area above the x axis is obtained as we go from left to right and the area under the x axis is\nobtained as we go from right to left. In this example\nI\np dx = 2πI .\n(1.14)\nMore generally, for other systems the left-hand side is an adiabatic invariant. The value of the invariant\nis different for different systems, for the oscillator it is 2πE/ω .\n1.2\nQuantum mechanics systems\nWhat does it suggest for quantum mechanics?\nFirst, for the harmonic oscillator\n\nE\n~ω n + 2\n(1.15)\n= ~ n +\n=\nω\nω\nE\nFixed\nis fixed quantum number! This suggests that in QM the quantum number doesn't tend to\nω\nchange under adiabatic changes. Indeed, we get the same intuition from WKB: consider a potential\nwith two turning points a, b. We have the Bohr-Sommerfield quantization condition\nZ b\n\np(x)dx =\nπ\nn +\n~ a\n\nI\nrewritten as\np(x)dx = 2π~ n +\n(1.16)\nf\nThe left hand side, as noted before is an adiabatic invariant, so in the semiclassical approximation for\narbitrary potential we find that the quantum number may not change under adiabatic changes! We\nwill see that indeed that is the case.\nThe formula for transitions at first order in perturbation theory gives complementary intuition:\nδHfi(t0)\n\nZ\nt\ndt0\niωfit\nPf←i(t) =\n(1.17)\ne\ni~\nFor constant perturbations, f\nδHfi is time-independent and\niωfiT - 1\n| f\nδHfi|2\n~2\n\nZ t\ne iωfit dt0\n\n= | f\nδHfi|2\n~2\ne\nPf ←i(t) =\n(1.18)\n.\nω2\nfi\nω2\nfi\n- If the spectrum is discrete, it is hard to jump a big energy gap because of the\nsuppression.\n- For slowly varying perturbations (compared to ωfi) the\nω2\nfi suppression will remain.\nSo it is difficult in general to change state with constant or slow perturbations, suggesting again that\nquantum numbers are adiabatic invariants. That is why transitions to the continuum with constant\nperturbations essentially conserve energy. And why you need oscillatory perturbations for efficient\ntransitions between energy levels.\n\nAdiabatic Evolution\nSuppose you have found a ψ(t) such that\nH(t)|ψ(t)i = E(t)|ψ(t)i\n(2.1)\nwe'll call |ψ(t)i, defined by (2.1), an instantaneous eigenstate. I'd like to emphasize from the\nstart that, in general, an instantaneous eigenstate is not a solution of the time dependent Schr odinger\nequation. As it turns out, it is a useful tool to construct approximate solutions to the Schr odinger\nequation.\nLet us try to understand the relation between |ψ(t)i and |Ψ(t)i, the solution to the Schr odinger\nequation\ni~∂t|Ψ(t)i = H(t)|Ψ(t)i .\n(2.2)\nLet us try an ansatz, building the solution |Ψ(t)i using the instantaneous eigenstate:\n\nZ t\n\n|Ψ(t)i = c(t) exp\nE(t0)dt0 |ψ(t)i ,\n(2.3)\ni~ 0\nwith c(t) a function of time to be determined and where we have included a familiar time dependent\nphase. There is no guarantee this ansatz will work but it seems a good try.\nThe LHS of the Schr odinger equation then looks like\n\nZ\n\nt\n\nt\n1 Z\ni~∂t|Ψ(t)i = c (t) exp\nE(t0)dt0 |ψ(t)i + E(t)|Ψ(t)i + c(t) exp\nE(t0)dt0 |ψ (t)i (2.4)\ni~\ni~\nFor the RHS, using the instantaneous eigenstate equation, we have\n\nZ\n\nt\nH(t)|Ψ(t)i = c(t) exp\nE(t0)dt0 H(t)|ψ(t)i = E(t)|Ψ(t)i .\n(2.5)\ni~ 0\nEquating the two sides, we get\n\nZ\n\nZ\n\nt\nt\nc (t) exp\nE(t0)dt0 |ψ(t)i + c(t) exp\nE(t0)dt0 |ψ (t)i = 0\ni~\ni~\nand canceling the two exponentials we have\nc (t) |ψ(t)i = -c(t) |ψ (t)i .\n(2.6)\nMultiply by hψ(t)| we get a differential equation for c(t):\nc (t) = -c(t) hψ(t)|ψ (t)i ,\n(2.7)\nwhich happily we can solve. Letting c(t = 0) = 1 we can write\n\nZ\n\nt\nc(t) = exp -\nhψ(t0)|ψ (t0)idt0\n.\n(2.8)\n\nThe above exponential is a phase because the bracket in the integrand is actually purely imaginary:\nZ\nZ\nZ\nd\ndψ∗\nhψ(t)|ψ (t)i =\ndx ψ ∗ dψ =\ndx\n(ψ ∗ ψ) -\ndx\nψ\ndt\ndt\ndt\n(2.9)\nZ\nd\n=\ndx ψ ∗ ψ -h ψ (t)|ψ(t)i\ndt\nSince the wavefunction is normalized we have\nhψ(t)|ψ (t)i = -h ψ (t)|ψ(t)i = -hψ(t)|ψ (t)i ∗\n(2.10)\nshowing that indeed hψ(t)|ψ (t)i is purely imaginary. To emphasize this fact we write\nZ t\n\nc(t) = exp i\nihψ(t0)|ψ (t0)idt0\n(2.11)\nHaving apparently solved for c(t) we now return to our ansatz (2.3), we get\nZ\n\nt\n\nt\n1 Z\n|Ψ(t)i ' c(0) exp i\nihψ(t0)|ψ (t0)idt0 exp\nE(t0)dt0 |ψ(t)i .\n(2.12)\ni~\nBut there is a mistake in this analysis. We really did not solve the Schr odinger equation! That's why\nwe put a ' instead of an equality.\nThe equation we had to solve, (2.6), is a vector equation, and forming the inner product with hψ(t)|\ngives a necessary condition for the solution, but not a sufficient one. We must check the equation form\ning the overlap with a full basis set of states. Indeed since |ψ(t)i is known, the equation can only have a\nsolution if the two vectors |ψ (t)i and |ψ(t)i are parallel. This does not happen in general. So we really\ndid not solve equation (2.6). The conclusion is that, ultimately, the ansatz in (2.3) is not good enough!\nWe can see the complication more formally. At t = 0 equation (2.6) reads\nc (0)|ψ(0)i = -c(0)|ψ (0)i .\n(2.13)\nUsing Gram-Schmidt we can construct an orthonormal basis B for the state space with the choice\n|ψ(0)i for the first basis vector:\nn\no\nB =\n|1i = |ψ(0)i, |2i, |3i , . . .\n.\n(2.14)\nEquation (2.13) requires\nhn|ψ (0)i = 0\nn = 2, 3, . . .\n(2.15)\nThis will not hold in general. The key insight, however, is that (2.12) is a fairly accurate solution if\nthe Hamiltonian is slowly varying. Making the definitions:\nZ\nZ t\nt\nθ(t) ≡-\nE(t0)dt0 ,\nν(t) ≡ ihψ(t)|ψ (t)i ,\nγ(t) ≡\nν(t0)dt0\n(2.16)\n~ 0\nso that θ, ν and γ are all real, the state reads\n|Ψ(t)i ' c(0) exp (iγ(t)) exp(iθ(t))|ψ(t)i .\n(2.17)\n\nThe phase θ(t) is called the dynamical phase and the phase γ(t) is called the geometric phase.\nComment: Instantaneous eigenstates are rather ambiguous. If one has the |ψ(t)i, they can be modified\nby the multiplication by an arbitrary phase:\n|ψ(t)i →|ψ0(t)i = e -iχ(t)|ψ(t)i .\n(2.18)\nSystematic approach\nMust use a basis to see the error terms and get a more general picture. We will do this now sys\ntematically. But first let us state precisely the idea in adiabatic approximation. Consider a family of\ninstantaneous eigenstates:\nH(t)|ψn(t)i = En(t)|ψn(t)i\n(3.1)\nwith E1(t) < E2(t) < . . . , so that there are no degeneracies.\nAdiabatic approximation: If at t = 0 |Ψ(0)i = |ψn(0)i for some n, then if H(t) is slowly varying for\n0 ≤ t ≤ T then at time T we have |ψ(T )i ' |ψn(T )i up to a calculable phase.\nKey facts:\n1. The probability to jump to another state |ψk(t)i with k 6= n is highly suppressed.\n2. The phases can sometimes be relevant and have geometric meaning. An overall phase cannot be\nobserved but if we have a superposition\n|Ψ(0)i = c1|ψ1(0)i + c2|ψ2(0)i + . . .\n(3.2)\nthe relative phases acquired by |ψ1(0)i and |ψ2(0)i after time evolution can matter.\nCalculation:\nX\n|Ψ(t)i =\ncn(t)|ψn(t)i\n(3.3)\nn\nSchr odinger equation :\n\nX\nX\ni~\nc n|ψn(t)i + cn|ψn (t)i =\ncn(t)En(t)|ψn(t)i\n(3.4)\nn\nn\nact with hψk(t)| from the left:\nX\ni~c k = Ekck - i~\nhψk|ψ nicn\nn\n\nX\ni~c k = Ek - i~hψk|ψ kick - i~\nhψk|ψ nicn\n(3.5)\nn6=k\nWe can relate hψk|ψ ni to a matrix element of H(t) in the space of instantaneous eigenvectors\nH(t)|ψni = En(t)|ψni\n(3.6)\ntake time derivative\nH (t)|ψni + H(t)|ψ ni = E n(t)|ψni + En(t)|ψ ni\n(3.7)\n\nmultiplty by hψk(t)| with k 6= n\nhψk(t)|H (t)|ψni + Ek(t)hψk(t)|ψ ni = E n(t)hψk(t)|ψ ni\n(3.8)\nhence\n\nhψk(t)|H (t)|ψni\nHkn\nhψk(t)|ψ ni =\n≡\n(3.9)\nEn(t) - Ek(t)\nEn - Ek\nWe can use plug (3.9) back in Eq.(3.5) to get\n\nX\nHkn\ni~c k = Ek - i~hψk|ψ kick - i~\ncn\n(3.10)\nEn - Ek\nn6=k\n\nNote that if the term proportional to\nHkn\nvanishes, then |ck| = 1, hence if you start in |ψki you\nEn-Ek\nstay in |ψki.\nIf we ignore the extra term:\n\nZ\n\nt\n\nck(t) = ck(0) exp\nEk(t0) - i~hψk|ψ ki dt0\ni~ 0\n\nZ\n\nZ\n\nt\nt\n= ck(0) exp\nEk(t0)dt0 exp i\nihψk|ψ kidt0\ni~ 0\niθk(t) iγk (t)\n= ck(0)e\ne\n(3.11)\nwhere\nZ\nt\nθk(t) = -\nEk(t0)dt0\n(3.12)\n~ 0\nνk(t) = ihψk(t)|ψ k(t)i\n(3.13)\nZ t\nγ(t)k =\nνk(t0)dt0\n(3.14)\n\nLandau-Zener transitions\nTake ψ1(x; R) and ψ2(x; R) to be the electronic configurations of a molecule with fixed nuclei separated\nat a distance R.\nWe have\nH(R)ψi(x; R) = Ei(R)ψi(x; R)\n(4.1)\nDepending on R the states are polar or non po\nlar changing characteristic near R = R0. If R\nchanges slowly, ψ1 remains ψ1 or ψ2 will remain\nψ2. But if R varies quickly, then ψ1 → ψ2 near\nR0. This would be a non-adiabatic transition.\nThinking of R as a function of time, we have a\ntime dependent hamiltonian\n\nH R(t)\nwith instantaneous energy eigenstates\n\nψi x; R(t) ,\nEi R(t)\n\nwe can now plot the energies for constant velocity R\nWe can sometimes think of this as a 2-level problem; if no other eigenstates are relevant.\nSo consider a slightly idealized 2 × 2 system\n\nαt\nH(t) =\n-αt\n,\nα > 0\n|1i =\n(spin up)\n\nαt\nαt\nE1(t) =\n,\nE2(t) = -\n|2i =\n(spin down)\n(4.2)\n\nThe instantaneous eigenstates |1i, |2i are actually time independent.

Atoms are hard because even though the potential\ncreated by the nucleus is spherically symmetric, the Coulomb interactions between the electrons breaks\nthe spherical symmetry. In molecules even ignoring Coulomb repulsion between electrons, the potential\ncreated by nuclei that are spatially separated is not spherically symmetric.\nIn some approximation one can view a molecule as a system in which nuclei in classical equilibrium\nwith well localized positions while the electrons move around in the Coulomb potential created by the\nm\nnuclei. This approximation is reasonable since typically M ' 10-4 where m is the electron mass and\nM the nuclear one. In this picture slow nuclear vibrations adiabatically deform the electronic states.\nIn order to make estimates, consider a molecule of size a, so that\n~2\npelectron ∼\nand\nEelectron ∼\n(6.1)\n~\na\nma\nThe positively charged nuclei repell each other but the electrons in between create an effective attrac\ntion that, at equilibrium, cancels the repulsive forces. There will be nuclear vibrations around the\nequilibrium configuration. Consider the nuclear oscillations governed by the nuclear Hamiltonian\nP 2\nHN =\n+ kx2\n(6.2)\n2M\n\nThe restoring force is determined by k, and it is due to the electron system, with no reference to the\nmass M. Since k has units of energy over length-square, we must have\n~2\nEnergy\nk =\n∼\n.\n(6.3)\nL2\nma\nBut k = Mω2, with ω the frequency of nuclear oscillations so we have\nr\n~2\n~2\n~2\nω2 ∼ m\nm\nMω2 ∼\n→\n→\n~ω ∼\n.\n(6.4)\n2 4\nma\nM m a\nM ma\nWe thus find that the nuclear vibrational energies are\nr m\nEvibration ∼\nEelectron .\n(6.5)\nM\nThere are also rotations and their energy Erot is even smaller, as they involve essentially no distortion\nof the molecule\nL2\n~2`(` + 1)\nm ~\nm\nErot =\n'\n∼\n2 =⇒\n(6.6)\nErotation '\nEelectron\n2I\nMa2\nM ma\nM\nTherefore we have the following hierarchy of energies\nr m\nm\nEelectron : Evibration : Erotation = 1 :\n:\n.\n(6.7)\nM\nM\n6.1\nBorn-Oppenheimer approximation\nConsider a molecule with N nuclei and n electrons. The Hamiltonian takes the form\nN\nn\nX P2\nX\np\nH =\nα + VNN (R) +\ni + VeN (R, r) + Vee(r) ,\n(6.8)\n2Mα\n2m\nα=1\ni=1\nwhere Mα with α = 1, . . . , N are the nuclear masses and\nPα, Rα : nuclei canonical variables\nVNN : nuclei-nuclei interaction\npi, ri : electron canonical variables\nVee : electron-electron interaction\nR ≡ (R1, . . . , RN )\nVeN : electron-nuclei interaction\nr ≡ (r1, . . . , rn)\nThe wavefunction ψ(R, r) for the molecule is, in position space, a function of all the nuclear positions\nand all the electron positions.\nIn the limit when Mα/m →inf the nuclear skeleton may be considered fixed, making the positions\nR are fixed. The electrons then move under the effect of the nuclear potential VeN (R, r) with fixed R,\nand the electron-electron Coulomb repulsion. The relevant Hamiltonian He for the electrons is then\nn\nX p2\nHe(p, r; R) =\ni + VeN (R, r) + Vee(r) .\n(6.9)\n2m\ni=1\n\nThis is a different Hamiltonian each time we change the positions R of the nuclei. The associated\nSchr odinger equation for the electrons is\n\"\n#\nn\n~2 X\n(i)\n(i)\n-\nr + VeN (R, r) + Vee(r) φ\n(r) = E(i)(R)φ\n(r) .\n(6.10)\nri\nR\ne\nR\n2m i=1\nThe wavefunction for the electrons, as expected, is a function of the position of the electrons r, which\nappears as the argument of the wavefunction. Since the wavefunction depends on the nuclear positions,\nthis dependence is included as a subscript. Finally, the superscript i labels the various wavefunctions\n(i)\nthat may appear as solutions of this equation. The associated energies Ee (R) depend on the nuclear\n(i)\npositions and the label i. If we calculated all the φR (r) we would have a full basis of electronic\nconfigurations and we could write an ansatz for the full wavefunction of the molecule:\nX\nψ(R, r) =\nη(i)(R)φ(i)(r) ,\n(6.11)\nR\ni\nwhere the η(i) are the unknowns. Substitution into the full Schr odinger equation\nHψ(R, r) = Eψ(R, r) ,\n(6.12)\ngives an infinite set of coupled differential equations for η(i)(R). This is too difficult, so we try to\nmake do with a single term:\nψ(R, r) = η(R)φR(r) ,\n(6.13)\nwhere we would generally use for φR(r) the ground state wavefunction for the electrons in the frozen\nnuclear potential. If we have this wavefunction for all R, as we now assume, we also know the value\nEe(R) of the associated energy.\nWe will do a variational analysis. For this we will compute the expectation value hψ|H|ψi using\nψ(R, r) = η(R)φR(r). We will then utilize the known φR(r) to integrate the electronic dependence in\nthe expectation value\nZ\nZ\nhHi =\ndRdr ψ ∗ (R, r)H ψ(R, r) =\ndRdr η ∗ (R)φR\n∗ (r)H η(R)φR(r)\n(6.14)\nZ\n=\ndR η ∗ (R)Heff η(R) ,\nthus discovering the effective Hamiltonian Heff for the nuclear degrees of freedom. We begin the\ncalculation by rewriting the original Hamiltonian:\nN\nX P2\nα\nH = HˆN + Hˆe ,\nHˆN =\n+ VNN (R) .\n(6.15)\n2Mα\nα=1\n\nˆ\nAs a warmup we calculate the expectation value of He:\nZ\nhHei =\ndR dr η ∗ (R)φ ∗\nR(r)Hˆeη(R)φR(r)\nZ\nZ\n\n=\ndR η ∗ (R)\ndr φ ∗\nR(r)HˆeφR(r) η(R)\n|\n{z\n}\nEe(R)\nZ\n=\ndR η ∗ (R)Ee(R)η(R) .\n(6.16)\nThis term has contributed to the effective nuclear Hamiltonian the value of the R dependent electron\nenergy.

By detecting the by-products one aims to study the interactions that occur during\nthe collision.\nCollisions can be rather intricate.\nFor example, the particles involved may be not\nelementary (protons) or they may be elementary (electrons and positrons)\np + p\n→\np + p + π0\np + p\n→\np + n + π+\ne+ + e-\n→\nμ+ + μ-\nThe final products may not be the same as the initial particles. Some particles may be\ncreated.\nHere collisions are like reactions in which\na + b\n→\nc + d + e + . . .\nWe have scattering when the particles in the initial and final state are the same\na + b →a + b\n\nCHAPTER 7. SCATTERING\nThe scattering is elastic if none of the particles internal states change in the collision1. We\nwill focus on elastic scattering of particles without spin in the nonrelativistic approximation.\nWe will also assume that the interaction potential is translational invariant, that is,\nV (r1 - r2). It follows that in the CM frame the problem reduces, as we did for hydrogen\natom, to scattering of a single particle of reduced mass off a potential V (r). We will work\nwith energy eigenstates and we will not attempt to justify steps using wave-packets.\n7.1\nThe Schr odinger equation for elastic scattering\nWe are interested in energy eigenstates\nH = p2\n2M + V (r)\n(7.1.1)\nψ(r, t) = ψ(r)e-iEt\nħ\n(7.1.2)\n\n-ħ2\n2M ∇2 + V (r)\n\nψ(r) = Eψ(r)\n(7.1.3)\nFigure 7.1: Potential is finite range, or vanishes faster than 1\nr as r →inf\nWill be consider solutions with positive energy. The energy is the energy of the particle\nfar away from the potential, E = ħ2k2\n2M . The Schr odinger equation then takes the form\n\n-ħ2\n2M\n∇2 + k2\n+ V (r)\n\nψ(r) = 0\n(7.1.4)\nNow we must set up the waves!\nRecall the 1D case.\nPhysics dictates the existence of\nthree waves: an incoming one, a reflected one, and a transmitted one. We can think of\nthe reflected and transmitted waves as the scattered wave, the waves produced given the\nincoming wave. Setting up the waves is necessary in order to eventually solve the problem\nby looking into the details in the region where the potential is non-zero. When the potential\nhas finite range the incoming and scattered waves are simple plane waves that are easily\n1Frank-Hertz experiment involved inelastic collisions of electrons with mercury atoms in which the mer-\ncury atoms are excited.\n\n7.1. THE SCHR ODINGER EQUATION FOR ELASTIC SCATTERING\nwritten.\nEquation (7.1.4) has an inifinite degeneracy of energy eigenstates. When V (r) ≡ 0, for\nexample, eik·x for any k such that k · k = k2 is a solution. Assume an incident wave moving\ntowards +zˆ. Then the wavefunction will look like\nφ(r) = eikz\n(7.1.5)\nIf we assume V (r) has a finite range a, this φ(r) satisfies (7.1.4) for any r > a. For r < a,\nhowever, it does not satisfy the equation; φ(r) is a solution everywhere only if the potential\nvanishes.\nGiven an incident wave we will also have a scattered wave. Could it be an ψ(r) = eikr\nthat propagates radially out?\n∇2 + k2\neikr = 0\nfails badly for r = 0!!\n(7.1.6)\nOn the other hand\n∇2 + k2 eikr\nr\n= 0\nfor r = 0 .\n(7.1.7)\nThis is consistent with the radial equation having a solution u(r) = eirk in the region where\nthe potential vanishes. Recall that the full radial solution takes the form u(r)/r.\nCan the scattered wave therefore be eikr\nr\n? Yes, but this is not general enough. We need to\nintroduce some angular dependence. Hence our ansatz for the scattered wave is\nψs(r) = fk(θ, φ)eikr\nr\n( .1.8)\nWe expect the intensity of the scattered wave to depend on direction and the function\nfk(θ, φ) does that. We will see that ψs is only a solution for r ≫a, arbitrarily far.\nBoth the incident and the scattered wave must be present, hence the wavefunction is\nψ(r) = ψs(r) + φ(r) ≃eikz + fk(θ, φ)eikr\nr\n,\nr ≫a .\n(7.1.9)\n\nCHAPTER 7. SCATTERING\nAs indicated this expression is only true far away from the scattering center. We physically\nexpect fk(θ, φ) to be determined by V (r). fk(θ, φ) is called the scattering amplitude.\nWe now relate fk(θ, φ) to cross section!!\ndσ =\nh\n# particles scattered per unit time\ninto solid angle dΩabout (θ, φ)\ni\nh\nflux of incident particles =# particles\narea · time\ni\n(7.1.10)\ndσ is called differential cross section, it's the area that removes from the incident beam the\nparticles to be scattered into the solid angle dΩ. Let us calculate the numerator and the\ndenominator. First the denominator, which is the probability current:\nIncident flux\nin eikz\n= ħ\nmIm [ψ∗∇ψ] = ħk\nm ˆz\n(7.1.11)\nIntuitively, this can be calculated by multiplying the probability density |eikz|2 = 1, by the\nvelocity\np\nm = ħk\nm . The result is again an incident flux equal in magnitude to ħk\nm .\nTo calculate the numerator we first find the number of particles in the little volume of\nthickness dr and area r2dΩ\ndn = number of particles in this little volume\ndn = |ψ(r)|2 d3r =\nfk(θ, φ)eikr\nr\n\nr2dΩdr = |fk(θ, φ)|2 dΩdr\n(7.1.12)\nWith velocity v = ħk\nm all these particles in the little volume will go cross out in time dt = dr\nv ,\ntherefore the number of particles per unit time reads\ndn\ndt = |fk(θ, φ)|2 dΩdr\ndr\nv\n= ħk\nm |fk(θ, φ)|2 dΩ\nBack in the formula for the cross section we get\ndσ =\nħk\nm |fk(θ, φ)|2 dΩ\n\nħk\nm\nhence\nDifferential cross section:\ndσ\ndΩ= |fk(θ, φ)|2\n(7.1.13)\nTotal cross section: σ =\nZ\ndσ =\nZ\n|fk(θ, φ)|2 dΩ\n(7.1.14)\n\n7.2.

SCATTERING\nand we are going to refer to G+ as the outgoing wave Green function and to G-as the\ningoing wave Green function.\nLet's verify that this works, write G as a product: G±(r) = e±ikr -1\n4πr\n\n, so that\n∇2G±(r) =\n\n∇2e±ikr\n-1\n4πr\n\n+ e±ikr∇2\n\n-1\n4πr\n\n+ 2\n\n∇e±ikr\n· ∇\n\n-1\n4πr\n\n(7.3.11)\nRecall that\n∇2 = ∇· ∇,\n∇r = r\nr ,\n∇· (fA) = ∇f · A + f∇· A\n(7.3.12)\nTherefore\n∇e±ikr = ±ikr\nre±ikr ,\n∇2e±ikr =\n\n-k2 ± 2ik\nr\n\ne±ikr\n(7.3.13)\nthen\n∇2G±(r) =\n\n-k2 ± 2ik\nr\n\ne±ikr\n\n-1\n4πr\n\n+ e±ikrδ3(r) + 2\n\n±ike±ikr r\nr\n\n·\n\nr\n4πr3\n\n= -k2G±(r)\n\n∓2ik\n4πre±ikr + δ3(r)\n\n± 2ik\n4πre±ikr\n= -k2G±(r) + δ3(r)\n✓\n(7.3.14)\nWe will use\nψ0(r) = eikz\nand\nG = G+\n(7.3.15)\nThus, with these choices, (7.3.6) takes the form\nψ(r) = eikz +\nZ\nd3r′G+(r -r′)U(r′)ψ(r′)\n(7.3.16)\nwhere\nG+(r -r′) = -1\n4π\neik|r-r′|\n|r -r′|\n(7.3.17)\nWe now want to show that this is consistent with our asymptotic expansion for the energy\neigenstates. For that we can make the following approximations\nFor the G+ denominator:\n|r -r′| ≃r\n(7.3.18)\nFor the G+ numerator:\n|r -r′| ≃r -n · r′\n(7.3.19)\nwhere\nn ≡r\nr\n\n7.3. INTEGRAL SCATTERING EQUATION\nIn this way\nG+(r -r′) = -1\n4πreikre-ikn·r′\n(7.3.20)\nThus\nψ(r) = eikz +\n\n-1\n4π\nZ\nd3r′e-ikn·r′U(r′)ψ(r′)\neikr\nr\n(7.3.21)\nThe object in brackets is a function of the unit vector n in the direction of r. This shows that\nthe integral equation, through the choice of G, incorporates both the Schr odinger equation\nand the asymptotic conditions. By definition, the object in brackets is fk(θ, φ), i.e.\nfk(θ, φ) = -1\n4π\nZ\nd3r′e-ikn·r′U(r′)ψ(r′) .\n(7.3.22)\nOf course, this does not yet determine fk as the undetermined wavefunction ψ(r) still\nappears under the integral. The incident wave has the form of eiki·r with ki the incident\nwave number, |ki| = k. For the outgoing wave we define ks ≡nk (in the direction of n),\nthe scattered wave vector. The expression for ψ(r) then becomes\nψ(r) = eiki·r +\n\n-1\n4π\nZ\nd3r′e-iks·r′U(r′)ψ(r′)\neikr\nr\n(7.3.23)\nWe will do better with the Born approximation.\n7.3.1\nThe Born approximation\nConsider the original integral expression:\nψ(r) = eiki·r +\nZ\nd3r′G+(r -r′)U(r′)ψ(r′)\n(7.3.24)\nRewrite by just relabeling r →r′\nψ(r′) = eiki·r′ +\nZ\nd3r′′G+(r′ -r′′)U(r′′)ψ(r′′) .\n(7.3.25)\nNow plug (7.3.25) under the integral in (7.3.24) to get\nψ(r) = eiki·r+\nZ\nd3r′G+(r-r′)U(r′)eiki·r′+\nZ\nd3r′G+(r-r′)U(r′)\nZ\nd3r′′G+(r′-r′′)U(r′′)ψ(r′′)\n(7.3.26)\nRepeat the trick once more to find\nψ(r) = eiki·r +\nZ\nd3r′G+(r -r′) U(r′)eiki·r′\n+\nZ\nd3r′G+(r -r′)U(r′)\nZ\nd3r′′G+(r′ -r′′) U(r′′)eiki·r′′\n+\nZ\nd3r′G+(r -r′)U(r′)\nZ\nd3r′′G+(r′ -r′′)U(r′′)\nZ\nd3r′′′G+(r′′′ -r′′)U(r′′′)ψ(r′′′)\n(7.3.27)\n\nCHAPTER 7.

The preparatory work was done in (7.3.23), so we\nhave now\nψBorn(r) = eiki·r -1\n4π\nZ\nd3r′e-iks·r′U(r′)eiki·r′ eikr\nr\n(7.3.29)\nhence\nfBorn\nk\n(θ, φ) = -1\n4π\nZ\nd3re-iK·rU(r) .\n(7.3.30)\nHere we defined the wave-number transfer K:\n|ki| = |ks| ,\nK ≡ks -ki\n(7.3.31)\nNote that we eliminated the primes on the variable of integration - it is a dummy variable\nafter all. The wave-number transfer is the momentum that must be added to the incident\none to get the scattered one. We call θ the angle between ki and ks (it is the spherical\nangle θ if ki is along the positive z-axis).\nNote that\nK = |K| = 2k sin θ\n(7.3.32)\nIn the Born approximation the scattering amplitude fk(θ, φ) is simply the Fourier transform\nof U(r) evaluated at the momentum transfer K! fk(θ, φ) captures some information of V (r).\nIf we have a central potential V (r) = V (r), we can simplify the expression for the Born\nscattering amplitude further by performing the radial integration.

Two waves reach the desired\npoint r. The first is the direct incident wave. The second is a secondary wave originating at\nthe scattering \"material\" at a point r′. The amplitude of a secondary source at r′ is given\nby the value of the incident wave times the density U(r′) of scattering material at r′.\nIn the second figure again an incident wave hits r.\nThe secondary wave now takes\ntwo steps: the incident wave hits scattering material at r′′ which then propagates and hits\nscattering material at r′, from which it travels to point r.\n\nCHAPTER 7.

It is intuitively clear that any\npermutation can be written as product of transpositions: any set of integers can be reordered\ninto any arbitrary position by transpositions (in fact by using transpositions of consecutive\nlabels). The decomposition of a permutation into a product of transpositions is not unique,\nbut it is unique (mod 2). Hence we have that every permutation is either even or odd. A\npermutation is said to be even if it is the product of an even number of transpositions, and\nit is said to be odd if it is the product of an odd number of transpositions.\nSince transposition operators are and unitary any permutation is a unitary operator. All\ntranspositions are also Hermitian, but an arbitrary product of them is not hermitian be-\ncause the transpositions do not necessarily commute.\nIn fact, the Hermitian conjugate of a permutation is its inverse, which is a permutation\nof the same parity.

Since the wavefunction i s symmetric under this exchange, (8.3.3)\nshows that the hydrogen atom is a boson!\n5.

Basis states in V ⊗N take the form\n|ui⟩(1) ⊗ . . . |up⟩(N)\nwhere the one-particle states form an orthonormal basis of V :\nV = span{|u1⟩, |u2⟩, . . . }\n(8.4.2)\nBy applying ˆS or ˆA to the full set of states in V ⊗N we obtain all physical states in SymNV\nand AntiNV . But many different states in V ⊗N can give rise to the same state in SymNV\nand AntiNV after the application of the projectors.\nTo distinguish basis states in V ⊗N that after application of ˆS or ˆA are linearly indepen-\ndent, define the occupation number. We assign a set of occupation numbers to a basis state\n|·⟩⊗· · · ⊗|·⟩. An occupation number is an integer ni ≥0 associated with each vector in V :\n|u1⟩\nn1\n, |u2⟩\nn2\n, . . . , |uk⟩\nnk\n, . . .\n(8.4.3)\nWe define nk to be the number of times that |uk⟩appears in the chosen basis state\n|·⟩⊗· · · ⊗|·⟩. Thus, by inspection of the state |·⟩⊗· · · ⊗|·⟩we can read all the occu-\npation numbers n1, n2, · · · . It should be clear that the action of a permutation operator on\na basis state in V ⊗N will not change the occupation numbers.\nTwo basis states in V ⊗N with the same occupation numbers can be mapped into each\nother by a permutation operator; they lead to the same state in SymNV and to the same\nstate (up to a sign) in AntiNV . Two basis states in V ⊗N with different occupation numbers\ncannot be mapped into each other by a permutation operator. They must lead to different\nstates in SymNV and to different states in AntiNV , unless they give zero.\nGiven the occupation numbers of a basis state, we denote the associated basis state in\nSymNV as follows\n|n1, n2, . . . ⟩S\nni ≥0\n(8.4.4)\n\nCHAPTER 8.

These states form\nan orthonormal basis in AntiN V .\n8.5 Particles that live in V ⊗ W\nA particle may have space degrees of freedom, described by a vector space V and spin degree\nof freedom associated with W . Suppose we have a state than of 2 such particles described\nin (V ⊗ W )⊗2 for example\n|ψ⟩= |vi⟩(1) ⊗|wi⟩(1) ⊗|vj⟩(2) ⊗|wj⟩(2) + . . .\n(8.5.1)\nThis ψ should belongs either to Sym2(V ⊗W) or to Anti2(V ⊗W).\nThe permutation\noperator here that exchange particles 1 and 2 is\nˆP3412|ψ⟩= ˆP3412\n\n|vi⟩(1)⊗|wi⟩(1)⊗|vj⟩(2)⊗|wj⟩(2)\n\n= |vj⟩(1)⊗|wj⟩(1)⊗|vi⟩(2)⊗|wi⟩(2) ( .5.2)\nWanto to express this in terms of Sym2V , Anti2V , Sym2W, Anti2W.\nWhy?
