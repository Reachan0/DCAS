Policy and planning decision-makers frequently focus on the impact that human settlement patterns, land use decisions, and risky technologies can have on vulnerable populations. However, to ensure safety and promote equity, they also must be familiar with the social and political dynamics that are present at each stage of the disaster management cycle. Therefore, this course will provide students with:\n\nAn understanding of the breadth of factors that give rise to disaster vulnerability; and\n\nA foundation for assessing and managing the social and political processes associated with disaster policy and planning.\n\nThis course is designed for people interested in disasters from a research or policy perspective and for those who may be charged with responsibility for on-the-scene intervention. The semester will begin with an overview of risk, vulnerability, resilience and then focus on disaster institutions, policy, and politics. We will conclude by examining organizational and individual behavior in high-stress situations. Throughout the semester, particular attention will be paid to how disaster management efforts can increase the vulnerability of some populations or can promote widespread resilience.\n\nCourse Assignments\n\nReaction Papers\n\nYou are required to write brief (not more than one-page) reaction papers on the readings each week and post them before each class. Reaction papers will not be graded, but they count towards your final grade.\n\nClass Participation\n\nThis course is oriented around guest speaker presentations. It is expected that you will come to class prepared to engage the speakers and to actively reflect and assess course readings in small group discussions. To facilitate discussion, class participation also includes the requirement that before each class you read at least three reaction papers posted by other students.\n\nTerm Paper(s)/Project\n\nYou have the option to submit either a single term paper or two short papers. In either case, your work should examine a topic of personal interest that is related to the social or political dynamics of disasters.\n\nGrading\n\nACTIVITIES\n\nPERCENTAGES\n\nReaction Papers\n\n25%\n\nClass Participation\n\n25%\n\nTerm Paper(s)/Project\n\n50%",

      "content": "May 2, Threat, Error, and Resilience in High Hazard Settings Assignment\nJenny W. Rudolph\nBoston VA Medical Center and Boston University School of Public Health\nPeople's habitual ways of thinking and reacting emotionally are an invisible part of\ndisaster planning and, particularly, response. These invisible thought and feeling\nprocesses influence how successful disaster planners and responders, working in either\nphysically and socially risky environments, are at achieving their goals.\nWhen and why do intelligent, well-trained people in high-morale enterprises make\nmistakes that lead to catastrophic outcomes? How can they learn not to do so when the\nstakes are high? Developing less brittle, more resilient internal cognitive and emotional\nresponses are key barriers or defenses (see Reason chapter for description of defenses)\nagainst unsafe outcomes in high-hazard situations. This assignment uses student's own\ndifficult and challenging work conversations to excavate some of the layers of this\nprocess. The assignment starts with two premises: First, people can become emotional\nand tense when they have to act quickly in the face of potential threats to their own and\nother people's physical safety or to their reputation, identity, relationships (See the Staw,\nSandelands and Dutton article for more detail). Second, each person's ingrained\nthinking, talking, and emotional responses are remarkably stable across different social\nand professional situations, especially when threat is involved.\nFor this assignment, we ask you to prepare a short (1-2 page) case related to a difficult\nor challenging situation in your work (or if no work examples come to mind) your\npersonal life. The best cases address an issue with some emotional heat for the case\nwriter that recur over and over. Follow the case template outlined in the Rudolph,\nTaylor, and Foldy article and the following instructions developed by Action Design, a\nconsulting firm focusing on reflective practice (Action Design, 2000:\nhttp://www.actiondesign.com/resources/case_writing.htm). Write only the case, don't do\nthe case analysis (we'll work on some cases in class.) When you are finished, please\npost your case. Please bring 4 hard copies of your case to class. (We will pick\nsome cases to analyze together in small groups in class.)\nAs an historical note, this type of case analysis originated in the department of Urban\nPlanning here at MIT with the work of Donald Schon, who was interested the tacit\ncognitive routines embedded in the work of urban planners.\nThe Action Design Case Guidelines:\nLeft-hand/right-hand column cases are a powerful and versatile learning technology. By\nwriting a case describing an actual situation you focus your learning on what is most\nimportant and relevant to you. Reconstructing what you and others said in the right-hand\ncolumn helps make the learning actionable. Reconstructing your thoughts and feelings in\nthe left-hand column makes it possible to reflect on your reasoning and to see\nopportunities to reframe the situation.\nThis page describes how to write a left-hand/right-hand column case for use in an Action\nDesign workshop. The quality of your case will have a major impact on what you learn.\nThe best cases focus on moments that illustrate a key theme, issue, or recurring\ndifficulty that you would like to learn to handle more effectively. It usually takes about an\nhour to write a case.\n\n1. Think of an episode that illustrates a difficult or challenging issue in your work.\nPlease choose something in which you were personally involved and which you\nwould like to learn to handle as productively as possible. State what the\nchallenge was (e.g., creating a cross-functional culture in a planning team;\ndisagreeing with an authority figure).\n2. Please describe the context briefly: who was there, the purpose of the\nencounter, what had just happened. Make up the names if you wish.\n3. Describe what actually happened by reconstructing key moments in the\nconversation. Divide your paper into two columns as shown in the attached\nexample. (A template is provided for you, below.)\n4. On the right hand side of the page, write what you and others actually said. It is\nnot important to remember the exact words spoken. Your best recollection will\nbe fine. It is essential, however, that you write dialogue, as if from a play.\n-\nOn the left hand side of the page, write down any thoughts and\nfeelings that you had at the time and did not say.\n5. Please note any concerns or puzzles that still linger about the incident. Write\ndown also what help you would like from others when we discuss the case.\nAn Example\nMy Thoughts and Feelings\nWhat We Said\nMe: I don't understand why you have a problem\nwith what I'm suggesting.\nFrank doesn't like to lose. More\nFrank: Let me say it again. This will not work. We'll\nhyperbole; more pushing his own\nget into trouble sooner or later.\nview. We've heard all this before.\nIf he's right we're already dead.\nMe: Yours is an argument for doing nothing. If we\ncannot fix this business, we might as well sell it.\nHe's preying on Steve's (the\nFrank: We've been through this before. We cannot\nCEO's) fears. Why doesn't he\nafford the risk.\noffer ideas about how we could\nmake this work.\nMe: I'm not saying there's no risk; I'm saying that\ndoing nothing is not the answer either. Your guys\nwere there when we put the plan together and they\ndidn't see it as that big a risk.\nFrank: You browbeat them. They said you wouldn't\nLike hell I did.\nlisten.\n(and so on. . .)\n\nFormat for left-hand/right-hand column case1\n(Respond to questions 1, 2, and 4 by inserting the cursor just after the \":\" mark and\ntyping.

      "content": "Amy Mowl\nResponse Paper 1\n\"Assessing Urban Vulnerability and Social Adaptation to Risk\"\nPelling distinguishes between two responses to disaster. The most common approach is\nthe \"structural response,\" with the underlying assumption that disaster devastation is a\ntechnical problem. Pelling points out that in many cases, the technology exists to reduce\ndisaster risk, yet marginalized groups lack the social and political power necessary to\nmake decision-makers respond to their concerns. While the structural response is\nimportant, Pelling argues that it fails to examine the cultural and social factors that\nincrease physical vulnerability to disaster.\nPelling introduces the social vulnerability approach, in which people's vulnerability is\naffected by their access to material, social, and political assets. According to this\ndefinition, social vulnerability is not synonymous with poverty; in addition, Pelling\nstresses the importance of recognizing the different risks within communities due to age,\ngender, case, or land-holding status, all of which can affect vulnerability and risk.\nPelling discusses the concept of \"adaptive potential,\" which consists of two different\nresponses to risk: coping (behavior that directly reduces the likelihood or impact of a\nshock) and institutional modification (which changes institutions in a way that allows\ngreater coping behavior to develop).\nPelling uses the example of Los Manguitos to illustrate that increasing the participation\nof local actors in reducing urban disaster risk can be extremely important, but that local\nactors by themselves cannot be expected to carry the burden of risk mitigation: local and\nnational governments must play a critical role. I found the recognition that a continued\npush for participatory, bottom-up approaches can lead to undue stresses and a shifting of\nthe responsibilities of the state to the poor a particularly welcome observation.\n\"The Vulnerability of Cities\"\nPelling argues that a particular set of challenges arise in the face of urban disasters, which\nare smaller, more frequent and more diverse that rural disasters. Urban areas can act as a\n\"crucible\", in which one disaster has a multiplier effect: for example, immediate flooding\nmay cause immediate injury and destruction of physical assets, but water supplies may\nbecome polluted, leading to disease.\nPelling divides vulnerability into three components: exposure (primarily a function of\nphysical location, and character of surrounding environment); resistance (a function of\nthe economic, mental, and physical health of the affected); and resilience (the ability of\nan individual to cope with a given shock). As in the first article, all three components of\nvulnerability are shaped by access to social, political, and economic resources.\nPelling discusses the \"entitlements\" or livelihoods approach, in which the assets used for\npoor people to cope, when lost, can worsen the cycle of poverty by reducing the\nhousehold's income earning capacity.\n\nAmy Mowl\nResponse Paper 1\nPelling argues the need to distinguish among those with different risks in urban contexts:\nwomen, squatters, low-skilled laborers, those little human capital (such as education or\ntraining), and those with few social networks. Pelling also discusses how income\ndiversification is one of the most effective tools in mitigating the impact of disasters. I\nwould be interested to see any research on how social capital works across rural and\nurban areas: it is very common for rural families to have family members in the city who\nsend money home after unforeseen shocks such as floods or crop failures, and for rural\nfamilies to send money to the cities during times of high unemployment.\n\"From everyday hazards to disasters: the accumulation of risk in urban areas\"\nThe authors argue that in the context of growing urbanization, the definition of \"disaster\"\nmust be expanded to included smaller hazards that, while they may affect less people,\nbecause of their frequency affect a greater number of persons overall. The authors\nhighlight the divide between urban specialists, who see vulnerability as a function of\npeople's asset stocks and \"risks to livelihood from external shocks,\" and disaster\nspecialists, who focus on the extent to which people are physically at risk from disaster\nand their existing mechanisms to cope with the dangers, as well as the vulnerability of\nkey institutions or systems to deliver essential services. This divide prevents urban\nhazards from being adequately addressed.\nThe authors argue that \"small\" disasters in urban areas have different characteristics\n(spatial concentration and number of people at risk, greater diversity of hazards, and\nsynergy of hazards) than rural disasters, but that studying vulnerability and coping\nmechanisms to \"smaller\" urban disasters can provide valuable lessons for reducing\nvulnerability to more infrequent, larger scale disasters. While it is absolutely important\nto \"create a locally owed process of risk identification and reduction,\" and \"root (the\nunderstanding of risk) in local contexts,\" I believe that empirical studies are critical to\ngetting the funding necessary to improve urban risk management. International funding\nagencies and donors require documentation of problems and evidence of what works\nbefore committing to long-run programs. The authors' call for greater empirical studies\nwould assist in this area."

      "content": "Anisha Budhiraj (HSPH)\n11.941 - Disaster, Vulnerability and Resilience\nREACTION PAPER 1\nPelling - \"Assessing Urban Vulnerability and Social Adaptation to Risk\"\nThere is a gendered division in the CBO as per the article. Thus there is a need to give more\npreference to the women and young people to take on leadership roles. This article mentions the\ninvolvement of young people in drugs and crime due to lack of education and jobs. This may get\nresolved if they get involved in these organizations. There is also a need to enhance the public\nprivate partnerships which seems to be absent due to a lack of trust between government agencies\nand civil society actors. In Santo Domingo, planning is directed by presidential whim and there is\nno urban development plan. Also the financial and transaction costs of registration of the NGOs\nare very expensive, thus excluding them from receiving support from the international donors.\nThe style and content of contemporary urban politics in Santo Domingo remain profoundly\ninfluenced by almost 60 years of neo-paternalistic rule which could be devastating for the\neconomy.\nAnother way of addressing the important issue is to distinguish between current and future\nvulnerability. Current vulnerability, determined by past adaptation and the current availability of\ncoping options, provides a baseline from which a system's future vulnerability will evolve. This\nevolution will be mediated by the system's adaptive capacity and the extent to which this capacity is\nrealised as adaptation. At any given time, we may view a system as exhibiting a certain degree of\nvulnerability to a specified hazard, and as having a certain ability or potential to adapt so as to reduce\nits vulnerability to that hazard within any given time frame, constrained or modulated by a range of\nexternal factors.\nPelling - Chapter 3 in The Vulnerability of Cities\nWork needs to be done for the upliftment for the poor as it is the poor who are vulnerable and\nsuffer the most from environmental stresses and risk. I also agree with the statement that 'whilst\nage may increase vulnerability, experience can enhance coping.'\nTwo cases have been cited in the text. Firstly Wendy is a motivated and able woman but is held\nback from moving out of vulnerability by a lack of livelihood assets. At the same time, Ina is a\ndetermined family head with access to a modest level of financial capital. Ina was thus able to\nprotect her family and herself from the effects of frequent flooding. Thus the susceptibility of an\nindividual indeed seems to be an outcome of their access to economic, social, political, physical\nand environmental assets.\nThe adaptive capacity of poor communities in developing countries(India as per this article)is\ntypically low as local people lack the income; access to basic social services and natural\nresources; and empowerment needed to rebuild their lives in response to (for example) the loss of\nfood crops due to an increase in the number of drought years. Increasing the adaptive capacity of\nthese communities requires ensuring access to resources; income generation activities; greater\nequity between genders and social groups, and an increase in the capacity of the poor to\nparticipate in local politics and actions. In other words, increasing adaptive capacity requires\n\nAnisha Budhiraj (HSPH)\npromoting many activities associated with sustainable development. Thus, climate adaptation,\nsustainable development and improved equity can all be mutually reinforcing if policies are\nadvanced that lessen resource pressure, improve environmental risk management and increase\nwelfare for the poorest members of society.\nBull-Kamanga, et al - \"From Everyday Hazards to Disasters\"\nThe urban specialists and the disaster specialists have paid too little attention to disasters which\nare too small to fall within most official disaster statistics and which are not everyday statistics.\nThere is a need to concentrate on disasters of small scale which may lead to more damage and\nloss of lives as compared to the larger ones.\nI fully agree with the fact that the more powerful vested political and economic interests and the\nwealthier households are often protected from disasters. Politicians like in Bihar, India, may even\nbenefit from disasters, by being seen to respond when a disaster occurs, when they should have\nacted before it occurred to reduce the risk.\nThere is often a failure to perceive how serious the risks are until a disaster event occurs. This\nwas actually seen recently with the occurrence of Tsunami which caused widespread damage and\ndevastation. The disaster could have been reduced in intensity especially in areas where it hit\nlater.\nPelling - \"Natural Disasters\"\nThere is a need to identify which disasters are natural. Natural disasters affect the lives of many\nthousands of people each year. Within minutes, a natural disaster can rip apart a community, and\nchange the lives of its residents forever. People who understand disasters and know what to do\nbeforehand and after a disaster hits can significantly reduce disaster deaths and property damage.\nIt is patently impossible to discuss social engineering without implying extensive objectives of\nsocial control and destruction of human life, i.e., slavery and benevolent genocide. When a silent\nweapon is applied gradually, the public adapts to its presence and learns to tolerate its\nencroachment on their lives until the pressure becomes too great and they crack up.\nBihar appears to be the most vulnerable state to riverine flooding in India. A great amount of\nresources have been spent to improve the natural drainage, but profit hungry contractors often use\nfaulty materials which can increase the flood risk. Local political influence can also be seen in\nembankments, so that a politician can win the votes of a community. Thus there is a need to\nreduce the corruption and to generate awareness amongst the mass about the ill effects of the\nsystem."

      "content": "Cheryl Lowry\nReaction Paper 1, Natural Disasters\nNatural Disasters, Chapter 9, Pellon:\nPellon makes an obvious point that there are sociopolitical, economic, and natural factors that\nmake up a disaster. Human vulnerability and natural hazards are related, and he suggests natural\ndisasters are more accurately referred to \"humanitarian disasters with a natural trigger\". The\nconclusion I drew from this article was that it makes more sense to focus on reducing factors that\ncontribute to vulnerability, rather than focusing on changing nature itself.\nThe Marxist approach he discussed is perhaps most relevant in the coastal areas of developing\ncountries. These areas are often highly sought by developers, looking to make a quick profit.\nBuildings (hotels, resorts) are constructed sometimes without thorough analysis of underlying\ngeological data and vulnerability assessments. The materials and workmanship are sometimes\nlow quality (combined with relaxed or absent construction standards), in exchange for rapid\nconstruction for the tourist trade. Tourism subsequently creates jobs in areas where people may\nnot have otherwise settled en masse. This draws the local population into settlement in areas that\nmay be traditionally exposed to natural events. Greater population density, poverty, and poor\nconstruction can increase overall vulnerability to natural disasters. One could argue that local\neconomic stimulation would increase resilience; however, as Pellon states, it's important to\nassess the impact development has on social capital.\nAlong that line, it was also interesting to note that companies specializing in post-disaster\ncleanup, engineering, and reconstruction have much to gain (in terms of profit). Large\ncorporations have large voices in business and research, and could theoretically stifle progress in\nvulnerability mitigation.\nThe Vulnerability of Cities, and Assessing urban vulnerability and social adaptation to risk,\nPellon:\nHere Pellon also stresses the links between society and nature, each having interaction with the\nother. He suggests an integrated approach to planning, including indicators of human\nvulnerability, social factors and adaptability, social capital, in addition to evaluation of physical\nsystems, environment, political and economic issues. He uses the example of the Los Manguitos\nbarrio in Santo Domingo (Hurricane Georges, 1998) to illustrate resilience through good\ncommunity social cohesion.\nUN World Conference on Disaster Reduction, Hyogo Declaration:\nLots of politically correct idealism, but what does it really mean? What is the actual Hyogo\nFramework? Does it translate the idealism to substance? This declaration largely ignores social\ncapital, but did mention education, which is important. It's not enough to create early warning\nsystems; there must be a plan of action/response to warnings. Specifically, the public must be\nshown what actions to take when they receive a warning."

Social Nature, London:\nBlackwell, pp. 170-188.\nPelling reiterates the notion that 'disaster' be attributed to a confluence of social and physical factors that\njointly contribute to the end effect of a particular hazard; it is their interaction that determines the\nmagnitude and frequency of \"humanitarian disasters with natural triggers\". He discusses the entitlement\n(environmental stress exacerbates economic stress) and Marxist (socioeconomic structures control the\neffect of a hazard on a particular population) approaches to assessing vulnerability, resistance, and\nresilience. These are useful frames through which to understand the frequency of natural disasters in the\ndeveloping world as well as the reinforcing effect of many technological and emergency relief aid\nsolutions. I am somewhat troubled by the assumption that a disadvantaged individual has no capacity or\nresponsibility to make healthy economic and social choices to decrease his vulnerability. Is this an issue\nof inadequate education leaving certain segments of the population unaware of natural hazards and the\nsocial networks that mitigate their risk? Or, is it a simple economic decision for a subsistence farmer to\nlocate her family in a fertile flood plain? Certainly, many support networks (insurance, foreign aid, large-\nscale irrigation projects, and development grants) enable risky development in geographically unsuitable\nareas, but economic practicality also plays a significant role in stratifying risk just as it does wealth,\npolitical clout, and social status. South African townships continue burgeoning in some of the most\nhazardous locations and risky conditions despite the ostensible lifting of legal restriction because of an\ninability of the black working class to meet the cost of living in more secure and affluent suburbs that\nenjoy adequate infrastructure to provide resistance and resilience to disaster.\nBull-Kamanga, L., Diagne, K., Lavell, A., Leon, E., Lerise, F., MacGregor, H., Maskrey, A., Meshack, M.,\nPelling, M., Reid, H., Satterthwaite, D., Songsore, J., Westgate, K., Yitambe, A. 2003. \"From Everyday\nHazards to Disasters: The Accumulation of Risk in Urban Areas.\" Environment and Urbanization, 15(1):\n193-203.\nUrban areas are a good place to focus disaster mitigation efforts because their large, concentrated\npopulation and hierarchical social structures can either be a liability, significantly increasing risk among\nsome or all groups, or an asset, allowing effective resistance, resilience, and relief if well organized.\nEspecially in developed urban centers, the detrimental extent of a 'natural disaster' is determined directly\nby the community's response to a physical stressor, not by the magnitude of the particular event. For this\nreason, socioeconomic/political/ethnic inequities largely determine the vulnerability of certain populations.\nThings like access to and quality of basic infrastructure (both physical and social), econo-geographic\nconstraints on development, educational opportunities, and political clout all contribute to disparities in\nrisk burden. One of the major questions is how to rank the significance of various risk factors according\nto local values and most efficiently decrease overall disaster vulnerability. Is it necessary to take on\nadditional disaster risk in exchange for economic livelihood?\nPelling, Mark. 2002. \"Assessing Urban Vulnerability and Social Adaptation to Risk: Evidence from Santo\nDomingo.\" International Development Planning Review, 24(1): 59-76.\nIn this paper Pelling discusses adaptive potential as a 'human response to environmental risk' through\npractical coping and institutional modification. He emphasizes the importance of decentralized and\n'bottom-up' social and political structures in order to most effectively and sustainable serve the needs of\nthe entire community. In this way, local values are acknowledged, legitimate stakeholders are involved in\ncooperative decision-making and local knowledge and social capital is effectively utilized."

      "content": "Elisa Jaramillo\nReaction paper 1\n1. Pelling, M. \"Assessing Urban Vulnerability and Social Adaptation to Risk: Evidence from Santo Domingo.\"\nPhysical safety is not only dependent on the environmental risk but also on social vulnerability. We must\nconsider the influence of social structures that determine the individual and collective access to assets (e.g.\nsecure land and housing, social services, information flows, health services). This access is in turn\ndependent on the individual/household's hold on economic resources, social claims and political rights.\nOne way to explore this is by evaluating the \"adaptive potential\" or the capacity to reduce vulnerability that\npeople and groups have. It comprises two types of human response to environmental risk: coping and\ninstitutional modification. Both responses can be either purposeful if directly responding to the environmental\nhazard stress or incidental if it acts to a background stress. The response choices available may be\nconstrained by the developmental process (again: access to economic, political and social assets,\ninstitutional framework). Building this adaptive potential requires certain measures. The most important of\nwhich are:\n- Maximize limited public resources through a successful cooperation between state and non-state actors at\nall levels\n- Restructuring institutions in order to redistribute power\n- Build social capital including nurturing trust between different political actors so that it may develop into\nconstructive social organizations (CBOs, national NGOs). Pelling suggest an external agent as a catalyst.\nComment: The magnitude of a disaster does depend on the environmental (physical) hazard and the\nvulnerability of individuals/communities. I would place more importance on the later of the two not only\nbecause by building adaptive potential can we minimize the negative impacts of an event but because it is\nthe only element on which we have some control. I would also consider the influence of cultural norms and\ntraditions in determining vulnerability. Some societies may have access to assets but refuse to use them.\nAlso, I am concerned about the development of dependence on external catalysts and the consequential\ndeterioration of the trust on government institutions. In my limited experience working with an international\nNGO, I have seen little if any sustainable effects of activities after projects are closed.\n2. Pelling, M. \"Chapter 3, Social Vulnerability in the City\"\nContinues to build on the theories of social vulnerability and adaptive potential. Vulnerability is defined as\nhaving three components: Exposure, resistance and resilience.\nHere Pelling goes into depth about the \"entitlement perspective\" that explains how when assets that are key\nfor coping (labour, housing, possessions, tools of trade and social networks) are lost through any form of\nstress (including environmental) this will cause a reduction in the income capability of a household which\nrepresents a reduction in the household's range of entitlements making it more vulnerable to subsequent\nstressful events. This is linked to the ratchet effect where each new hazardous event makes the\nindividuals/communities impacted more vulnerable to future events.\nComment: Is the entitlement perspective the only explanation? It places households in a vulnerable and\ndependant situation as the access to key assets really does not depend on the members of the household\nbut on external social institutions.\n3. Bull-Kamanga et cols. \"From Everyday Hazards to Disasters: The accumulation of Risk in Urban Areas\"\nThe reading points out two important reasons why there has been an insufficient link between disasters and\nurban development (in Africa). First, there has been a reluctance of urban and disaster specialists to work in\ncollaboration. They have focused on different scales of the problem: Urban specialist on risks that are\nconstantly present while disaster specialists concentrate on risks from exceptional disaster events. It is\nimportant to integrate both so that urban management also includes identification of disaster risks and\nmeasures to reduce vulnerability.\nSecond, not enough importance has been given to \"small\" disasters and everyday events (which may\nrepresent more accumulative deaths). This is relevant as these events are becoming more frequent and\nglobal, may evolve to larger events and will help develop local and national capacity to respond to larger\nevents.\nComments: Where do disaster specialists traditionally base their work? What indices or sources of\ninformation do they use to determine risk? I don't understand how it has been possible for these two types of\n\nspecialist to have worked with limited collaboration in the past. How far has this collaboration improved?\nThough I understand why it is important to consider \"small\" disasters and everyday events in the prevention\nof larger events, isn't the magnitude of this task unmanageable? How to begin and how to link small events\nto larger?"

      "content": "Emily Farr\nReaction\n\nPaper\n\nPelling's \"Assessing Urban Vulnerability\" paper focuses on how CBOs can play a role in\nbuilding resilience, as well as responding to, disasters. His case study of Los Manguitos showed\nsome of the difficulties facing CBOs but clearly highlighted their role in disaster resilience in\nthis barrio and how they had been able to build on social capital. However, support of CBOs\nshould not be expected to replace the role of governments in reducing vulnerability. Pelling's\n\"Vulnerability of Cities\" chapter looked at the importance of assets in vulnerability and\nresilience, both in terms of exposure to disaster as well as ability to cope with disaster. This\nanalysis is important in showing how poverty reduction is a key strategy to mitigate the impact\nof disasters. Non-material assets were also included in the discussion, highlighting the\nimportance of both social assets and political power. Bull-Kamanga et al.'s \"From everyday\nhazards to disaster\" article discussed the lack of attention that policy makers and disaster\nagencies have given to urban disaster resistance, noting that processes affecting rural areas in\nAfrica tend to receive more attention than those of urban areas. Additionally, there is a focus on\npreventing large-scale disasters but not the smaller ones. The authors conclude that all these\nfactors must take local contexts into consideration and develop strategies accordingly.\nMy reaction\nI recently read an author that put forth the view that the poor and the each are equally affected by\ndisasters, but that the rich are more resilient in the long-term and able to quickly rebuild from\ndisaster, while the poor are forced into what Pelling would call the \"ratchet effect\" of disaster. I\nthought about this idea while reading through the papers, which don't fully discuss this\nphenomenon. I think that in some situations it has a lot of merit. The example of a hurricane\nwas used in the \"Assessing Urban Vulnerability\" paper--in such an event, the poor and rich are\nvery likely to be equally affected, since a hurricane is not as dependant on geographic location\nas, say, a flood is, and I think there is less of an ability to circumvent its effects through building\ncodes than there is when trying to mitigate the effect of earthquakes. Therefore, I could argue\nthat both groups are likely to be affected in an urban area by a hurricane. However, the rich may\nhave businesses in another part of town, have savings or an education--all of which will help\nthem to rebuild. The poor, however, are often likely to have a home-based business (as was\npointed out in one of Pelling's papers) and to hold all their assets in the home. A disaster would\nlikely wipe out their entire asset base, and they may have no outside savings. Additionally, since\npeople tend to have social networks of others within the same income bracket (if we're putting\npeople into categories of just \"rich\" and \"poor\"), the rich might have networks of other rich\npeople who weren't affected by the disaster, while the poor may also have these networks but\nother poor people would not be able to offer loans or help in rebuilding assets since they are\nthemselves poor. It was interesting to me to read about the lack of consideration of long-term\npolicies to decrease poverty as a way to increase resistance to disasters, since that is what I\nautomatically think of as the best strategy. Of course environmental and structural interventions\nare important, but they can't work in isolation from long-term social change. It was also\ninteresting for me to see the differences in the way that the same terminology that I use (e.g.\ncoping strategies) is used by those working in the natural disaster field."

      "content": "11.941\nSpring 2005\nShort Paper 1\nErnest Ryan B. Guevarra\nMasters of Public Health\nInternational Health / Humanitarian Studies\nHarvard School of Public Health\nWhen Amartya Sen's seminal writing on entitlements in the book Poverty and Famines\nwas released in 1981, it challenged the long accepted notion that hunger and famine is brought\nabout by drought. Sen argued that \"the rapid devaluing of individual or household productive\ncapacities, relative to the cost of staple foods, resulted in the denial of access to food and so\nincreased the vulnerability to malnutrition and famine\" rather than a result of production failure\ndue to drought. Sen's entitlement theory broke the well-accepted notion of causality between\ndrought (being the disaster or the causative agent) and famine and hunger by brining forth the\nconcept that some people are more vulnerable than others.\nMark Pelling in his work expands Sen's notion of entitlement to disasters as he examines\nthe underlying causes of vulnerability to them. In this regard, he brings forward the notion of an\nadaptive potential that broadens the framework in analyzing risk to include social assets,\nparticularly local and indigenous ones. His description here of social assets can be likened in\nsome way to Sen's entitlements but expands it to not only a relationship between people and\ngoods or products but also the connection of people with other people hence social assets. In this\nregard, Pelling makes a case that indeed, as exemplified by the case of Santo Domingo, local and\nnon-state actors have the capacity to address the different social structures that make them\nvulnerable to disasters. He then clarifies that these responses may take different forms and at\ntimes may not even be conscious or direct actions to reduce vulnerability. Nevertheless, these\nactions maintain or create local social capital that in turn adds to the adoptive potential of the\ncommunity. He, thus, agrees with current trend in policy that prioritizes the participation of local\nactors in disaster responses but reiterates that formal institutions such as the government/state\nshould still be part of the whole process. Pelling's and Sen's work underscores the need to be\nvery critical of current approaches to disaster response and mitigation that often only focus on\nand address the symptoms/effects and proximate causes and lose sight of the underlying causes\nand problems. Also, they emphasize the need to be sensitive to existing and latent local capacities\nand assets so as to be able to encourage their use either by preventing the factors that weaken or\nundermine them or creating the environment by which they are strengthened and potentiated.\nIn another work, Pelling asks the question of whether or not natural disasters are indeed\nnatural. Here, he shows through varied examples the human and social dimensions of disasters\nand how something that occurs naturally becomes \"unnatural\" due to human factors and social\nstructures. Also, he traces the roots of the physicalist view of disasters from the human ecology\napproach that defined disasters as \"those elements of the physical environment harmful to man\nand caused by forces extraneous to him.\" Today, this attribution of the physicalist view to human\necology may not necessarily hold true. Human ecology has expanded and grown a lot through the\nyears and has seen man as merely a small component of a bigger ecology of both living and non\nliving creatures and also social, economic cultural and political institutions and structures (as such\nthe fields of social, political, anthropological ecology, etc.). Thus, an ecological approach would\nactually encompass a lot of the human aspects of disasters as well as the social, economic,\ncultural and political dimensions. Pellling's work and also the ecological approach to disasters\nemphasize one thing: that to fully be able to understand and address disasters, a holistic and broad\nframework is needed to be able to capture in full the interconnections and the underlying factors\nthat cause, perpetuate and mitigate them."

      "content": "Jeevan Sahota\nReaction Paper 1\nThe readings for this week especially by Pelling, brings in a very important perspective of 'human dimension'\nin the context of vulnerability from disasters, which otherwise has been long dominated by engineering\noriented physical reduction of disasters, which of course is limited in its impact. This is not to undermine the\nimportance of physical intervention, but rather to highlight its very limited scope in that its benefits are largely\nreceived by elites and those who have access to formal sector resources. The Pelling readings appropriately\ntraces the link between poverty and vulnerability in urban areas which is of great concern as according to\nrecent estimates, by 2015, more than half of worlds population will be living in urban areas. While the\nreadings by Pelling addresses role of social capital and vulnerability reduction, the discussion on political\nassets of communities was limited and it was not clear how the political assets could be leveraged to guide\npolicy change intervention. I am particularly apprehensive about the political assets in the vulnerable\ncommunities as experience from India shows that most vulnerable urban population are often manipulated\nby political leaders by promising regularization of their houses without provision of basic amenities, and the\ncommunities are rarely organized. On global front, the extension of UN IDNDR agenda through UN Disaster\nReduction Strategy is a welcome step. The need of the hour is to much initiate more participatory\ndevelopment planning and engage communities in the decision making."
