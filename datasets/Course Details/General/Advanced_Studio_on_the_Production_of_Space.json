Even this short definition is enough to unfold the basic spectrum of questions concerning models and modeling - the question of representation, scale, and the relations with the \"real\" objects or spaces and reality in general.\n\nWe could then take a more critical path and ask: does a model represent a specific version of the thing that is already \"out here\" or it is used to produce an entirely new thing? Different, and even contradictory answers instantly appear if we drop this question in the fields of art and design. If we add the problem of calculation to the representational nature of models, discussion can easily slip into the problem of scientific objectivity. Pouring data into a model and claiming scientific neutrality of the results is deeply problematic, at least as much as realism of painting when it is made by meticulous copying of the human model.\n\nModels are powerful abstractions that have impacts on the way we think, feel, act and construct our worlds. They are unreal artifacts that mold reality. We rely on models, trusting their superior relevance and immanent ability to produce and reproduce objects, spaces, and above all - knowledge. Even the slightest change in the morphology of the model can transform reality as we know it. American historian and philosopher of science Thomas Kuhn recognized a revolutionary potential in these changes, whereas French mathematician Rene Frederic Thom explained that these seemingly unrelated or insignificant changes can cause a catastrophe. Indeed, introducing different forms of irregularities or disobedience within the dominant system of models and modeling can produce catastrophe and revolution, and this is exactly what we will be exploring within this class.\n\nThe class is developed around the concept of disobedient interference within the existing models of production of space and knowledge.\n\nModeling is the main modus operandi of the class as students will be required to make critical diagrammatic cuts through processes of production in different thematic registers - from chemistry, law and economy to art, architecture and urbanism - in order to investigate the sense of social responsibility and control over the complex agendas embedded in models that supports production of everyday objects and surroundings. Students will be encouraged to explore relations between material or immaterial aspects and agencies of production, whether they emerged as a consequence of connection of mind, body and space, or the infrastructural, geographical and ecological complexities of the Anthropocene. These production environments will be taken as modeling settings.\n\nFinal projects and accompanying documentation will be aggregated in an exhibition and publication that brings together selected disobedient modeling practices in culture, technology and science. The format of the exhibition and publication will be curated as a modeling experiment in its own right, a register of theoretical and methodological entanglements between different modeling agendas that will emerge during the semester-long research.\n\nThis course was developed with support from\nThe Alumni Class Funds\ngrant. First conducted in Fall 2012, this studio/seminar was led by Professor Gediminas Urbonas, and SMArchS '13 Alumna Mariel Villere with ACT Research Fellow Zenovia Toloudi. The Fall 2012 course was developed with support from the\nMIT Council for the Arts\nand the\nACT Pilot Grant Program\n.\n\nGrading\n\nACTIVITIES\n\nPERCENTAGES\n\nAttendance, class participation and a seminar presentation (including ACT lecture series)\n\n15%\n\nHands-on modeling assignments (documentation published on class blog)\n\n20%\n\nMidterm review of presentation and project proposal including research and design concept\n\n15%\n\nPenultimate review of presentation\n\n10%\n\nFinal project review\n\n40%",

While they have many\ndifferences, Rawls and Habermas have in common the idea\nthat the aim of the democratic society is the creation of a\nconsensus, and that consensus is possible if people are\nonly able to leave aside their particular interests and\nthink as rational beings. However, while we desire an end\nto conflict, if we want people to be free we must always\nallow for the possibility that conflict may appear and to\nprovide an arena where differences can be confronted.

A multitude typically classified as a\nquantity exceeding 100.\nFor Hobbes the multitude was a rabble that needed to enact a social\ncontract with a monarch, thus turning them from a multitude into a people.\nRecently the term has returned to prominence as a new model of\nresistance against global systems of power as described by political\ntheorists Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri in their book Empire.\n\nMULTITUDE\nvs.\nEMPIRE\n\nWe do not lack communication, on\nthe contrary, we have too much of it.\nWe lack creation.\nWe lack resistance to the present.\n-\nGilles Deleuze and Felix\nGuattari\nDeleuze, Gilles and Felix Guattari.

Individuals must become both more united\nand increasingly different.\n\nevery care organization, or aid\nagency, every educational institution, and any\nindividual course of treatment ought to have as\nits primary concern the continuous development\nof its practices as much as its theoretical\nscaffolding.\nthe logic of intensities, or eco-logic, is\nconcerned only with the movement and\nintensity of evolutive processes\n\nhttps://vimeo.com/38011942\nIntegrated World Capitalism (IWC), tends increasingly to decentre its sites\nof power, moving away from structures producing goods and services\ntowards structures producing signs, syntax and - in particular, through the\ncontrol which it exercises over the media, advertising, opinion polls, etc. -\nsubjectivity.\nmodels which claim to found a causal hierarchy between these semiotic\nregimes are well on their way to completely losing touch with reality.\nIt is intoxicated with and anaesthetized by a collective feeling of pseudo-\neternity.\n\nhttps://vimeo.com/38011942\nin the context of the acceleration of techno-scientific mutations and of\nconsiderable demographic growth\n\"we will only escape from the major crises of our era through the articulation of:\na nascent subjectivity\na constantly mutating socius\nan environment in the process of being reinvented\"\n\nhttps://vimeo.com/38011942\nsocial and aesthetic 'profitability' and\nthe values of desire.\nNature can not be separated from culture...we must learn to\nthink 'transversally'\nEscape route out of contemporary\nhistory\nInfluence of demons\nmen like Donald Trump are permitted to proliferate\nfreely, like another species of algae\nNot only species but also human\nsolidarity is becoming extinct\nUniversal basic income\nthe most 'modernist' capitalist formations seem, in their own\nway, to be banking on a return to the past, however\nartificial..\nhttps://vimeo.com\n'existentializing' ruptures of meaning\nNew micropolitical and microsocial\nNew solidarities; new gentleness\nInfluence of demons\nEcology must stop being associated with the image of a\nsmall nature-loving minority or with qualified specialists\nConstruct new forms of value\nAn ecology of resingularization\nExistential territories are in\nquestion\n\nhttps://vimeo.com/38011942\nI.
