Students use Java® programming language to complete weekly software assignments.\nHow is 1.00 different from other intro programming courses offered at MIT?\n1.00 is a first course in programming. It assumes no prior experience, and it focuses on the use of computation to solve problems in engineering, science and management. The audience for 1.00 is non-computer science majors. 1.00 does not focus on writing compilers or parsers or computing tools where the computer is the system; it focuses on engineering problems where the computer is part of the system, or is used to model a physical or logical system.\n1.00 teaches the Java programming language, and it focuses on the design and development of object-oriented software for technical problems. 1.00 is taught in an active learning style. Lecture segments alternating with laboratory exercises are used in every class to allow students to put concepts into practice immediately; this teaching style generates questions and feedback, and allows the teaching staff and students to interact when concepts are first introduced to ensure that core ideas are understood. Like many MIT classes, 1.00 has weekly assignments, which are programs based on actual engineering, science or management applications. The weekly assignments build on the class material from the previous week, and require students to put the concepts taught in the small in-class labs into a larger program that uses multiple elements of Java together.",

  "syllabus_content": "Course Meeting Times\n\nLectures: 3 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session\n\nRecitations: 1 session / week, 1 hour / session\n\nDescription\n\nThis course presents the fundamentals of object-oriented software design and development, computational methods and sensing for engineering, and scientific and managerial applications. It cover topics, including design of classes, inheritance, graphical user interfaces, numerical methods, streams, threads, sensors, and data structures. Students use JavaTM programming language to complete weekly software assignments.\n\nClass Format\n\nAll lectures are active learning sessions with lab exercises. Please bring your laptop computer to every class, and remember to sit in alternating rows. If you can't attend a lecture you must still do and hand in the active learning exercises by 7pm on the day of lecture. Active learning exercises are posted a week before lecture if you need to work on them early. Lecture notes and JavaTM files for each class are posted two or more days ahead of time. Please download the JavaTM files to your laptop before class. Solutions to lecture exercises and solution JavaTM files are posted about three hours after lecture on the same day.\n\nEach student will be assigned to a recitation section that will be held each week. Sections have up to 12 students. Attendance is mandatory. Please bring your laptop to your recitation section.\n\nPrerequisites\n\n18.01 (Single Variable Calculus)\n. We use calculus in class and homework.\n\nRegistration Requirements\n\nIf you are a graduate student, you must register for 1.001 or 1.002 instead of 1.00. 1.001 is a 9 unit \"G\" subject. If you are a grad student and need 12 units, you may register for 1.002. Undergrads must register for 1.00; you cannot register for 1.001/1.002.\n\nYou must add 1.00 to your registration in time to submit homework 1. Adds after that date are for exceptional circumstances only.\n\nTexts\n\nRecommended\n\nHorstmann, Cay.\nBig Java\n. 4th ed. Wiley, 2009. ISBN: 9780470509487. [Preview with\nGoogle Books\n]\n\nLook for discounted pricing, and you may be able to find it used. It's on reserve at Barker Engineering Library. You may use the 3rd edition.\n\nOptional\n\nPress, William, Saul Teukolsky, et al.\nNumerical Recipes in C: The Art of Scientific Computing\n. Cambridge University Press, 1992. ISBN: 9780521437202. [Preview with\nGoogle Books\n]\n\nThis is the source of the numerical methods we use; you should read the algorithm descriptions even if you don't wish to read the C code.\n\nLaptop Computers\n\nLaptop computers are required for class participation in 1.00, in all lecture/lab and recitation sessions. Please use your own laptop if you own one; you must download Java (J2SE), Javadoc and the Eclipse interactive development environment (IDE); see the\nTools section\nfor directions. A laptop with at least 1 GB of memory running Windows Vista, Windows 7, Mac OSX or Linux is needed to run the 1.00 software. A limited number of loaner laptop computers are available; please contact\nIS&T\nto request one. You may also share a laptop if necessary.\n\nGrading Policy\n\nGraded problem sets and quizzes will be returned in recitation about 10 days after they are submitted. Problem set grades, quiz and final exam grades will be available through class site gradebook. The 'late penalties' will not be reflected in the posted grades, but will be deducted from your total grade at the end of the term.\n\nACTIVITIES\n\nPERCENTAGES\n\n10 Problem Sets (each worth 4 points)\n\n40%\n\n30 Active Learning Exercise Sessions (each worth 1/3 of a point)\n\n10%\n\n2 In-class Quizzes (open book, open notes) (each worth 12 points)\n\n24%\n\nFinal Exam during Finals Period (open book, open notes) (worth 20 points)\n\n20%\n\nWeekly Recitations, Graded on Attendance and Participation\n\n6%\n\nAcademic Honesty\n\nAll 1.00/1.001/1.002 students are expected to adhere to the highest ethical standards in their work. Your conduct in 1.00/1.001/1.002 and more generally at MIT establishes habits of professional honesty that are likely to remain with you throughout your career.\n\n1.00 problem sets are individual assignments, not team projects. What you turn in must be your own work.\n\nRules for 1.00 problem sets are:\n\n1. You may work with other students in understanding the homework problem statement, and reviewing the lecture notes, readings and recitation notes.\n\n2. You may ask each other for assistance on questions of Java syntax and language features, but not on the program logic to answer homework questions. If discussions of syntax and language features involve examples, the examples must be different than the homework problem.\n\n3. You must write the Java program code on your own for each assignment. You are not allowed to look at other students' solutions, or show your solutions to other students. Sharing code fragments or viewing or copying each other's code is a violation of the academic honesty policy.\n\n4. If you need help to debug your program, obtain assistance from a TA during office hours. If you are working on the homework after office hours, you are allowed to ask other students for assistance in debugging your program. However, their assistance must be limited to determining what is wrong with your program. They may not correct or rewrite sections of it for you.\n\n5. You may copy and modify programs given in lecture or recitation notes or used in lecture or recitation by the instructors or TAs. You may also copy and modify programs from the text used in this subject.\n\nRules for 1.00 active learning exercises are:\n\n1. If you do the exercises in class, you may work together, up to three people. Each person in the group may turn in the same solutions if they worked together.\n\n2. If you do the exercises outside of class, you must do them individually. You may get help from other students as in homework sets, but what you turn in must be your own work.\n\nAny student that violates these guidelines may, at the discretion of the instructor-in-charge, receive an F as their final grade in 1.00/1.001/1.002. The 1.00 staff will also bring ethical violations to the attention of MIT authorities for appropriate disciplinary action.\n\nExtension Policy for Problem Sets\n\nProblem sets are due Friday at noon; they are submitted electronically on the course Web site. You will receive one penalty-free extension until the following Monday noon per semester. No extensions beyond that, except for medical or family emergencies, which generally require a note from the dean. See the instructor if this occurs. Late homework submitted after Friday noon and before Monday noon, beyond the one free extension, is penalized 30 points. Homework submitted after Monday noon receives no credit, since solutions are posted then. If Monday is a holiday, the late deadline is the next day classes are held.\n\nHomework and Active Learning Exercise Submission\n\nIf you hand in .class files (compiled code, not human readable) instead of .java files (source code, human readable), you will receive no credit. No exceptions. Double check what you hand in. If your submission is empty, even though you're sure you submitted it, you will receive no credit. No exceptions.\n\nMakeup Quiz Policy\n\nYou must request a makeup quiz at least two weeks before the quiz date, unless there is a medical or family emergency that arises after that. Email the head TA if you need a makeup quiz. Valid reasons include MIT-related travel and intercollegiate athletics. Schedule job and school interviews to avoid quiz dates; there are only two quizzes in 1.00 and you must be here for them. We do not automatically schedule makeup quizzes; if no one has requested one two weeks ahead of time, none will be offered (other than for medical or family emergency).\n\nCalendar\n\nSES #\n\nTOPICS\n\nKEY DATES\n\nControl and Scope\n\nL 1\n\nCourse Overview, Introduction to Java\n\nProblem Set 0 Out\n\nL 2\n\nInteractive Development Environment: Eclipse\n\nProblem Set 1 Out\n\nL 3\n\nOperators, Control Structures\n\nRecitation 1, Problem Set 0 Due\n\nL 4\n\nData Types, More Operators\n\n--\n\nL 5\n\nMore Data Types, Control Structures, Intro to Methods\n\nProblem Set 1 Due, Problem Set 2 Out\n\nL 6\n\nMethods and Scope\n\nRecitation 2\n\nClasses and Objects\n\nL 7\n\nClasses and Objects\n\n--\n\nL 8\n\nClasses II\n\nProblem Set 2 Due, Problem Set 3 Out\n\nL 9\n\nMethods and Objects, Access\n\nRecitation 3\n\nL 10\n\nStatic Methods and Data\n\n--\n\nL 11\n\nArrays, Arraylists\n\nProblem Set 3 Due, Problem Set 4 Out\n\nL 12\n\nRecursion\n\nRecitation 4\n\nInheritance\n\nL 13\n\nInheritance: Subclasses\n\nQuiz 1 Review\n\n--\n\nQUIZ I\n\n--\n\nL 14\n\nInheritance II: Abstract Classes, Methods\n\nRecitation 5\n\nL 15\n\nInheritance III: Interfaces\n\n--\n\nL 16\n\nDesign Lab I - Inheritance\n\n--\n\nGraphical User Interfaces\n\nL 17\n\nIntroduction to Swing\n\nRecitation 6\n\nL 18\n\nSwing Event Model\n\n--\n\nL 19\n\nInner Classes, Layout Managers\n\nProblem Set 5 Due, Problem Set 6 Out\n\nL 20\n\nModel-View-Controller, Timers\n\nRecitation 7\n\nL 21\n\n2D API, 2D Transformations\n\n--\n\nL 22\n\nDesign Lab II- Swing\n\nProblem Set 6 Due, Problem Set 7 Out\n\nStreams (Input/Output) and Exceptions\n\nL 23\n\nStreams I, Exceptions\n\nRecitation 8.

Problem Set 0 will not be graded but must\nbe completed to make sure your software installation and account on the course website\nfunction properly. If you do not understand or cannot complete any part of the problem\nset, please speak to a 1.00/1.001/1.002 staff member as soon as possible. Instructors,\nTAs and their email addresses are on the 1.00 Website as well as in the printed\nmaterials handed out at the first class.\n\nProblem 1: Read Initial Handouts\n\nAll the initial handouts include\n\n- Syllabus/FAQ\n- Lecture Schedule\n- Academic Honesty Guidelines\n- How to Install Java\n- How to Install Eclipse\n- How to Submit Problem Sets\n\nYou are required to read the Guidelines on Academic Honesty. After reading them,\nyou should understand that you can receive an F for your final grade in 1.00 by\ncommitting an academic honesty violation. In order to take the class, you must sign and\nreturn to the 1.00 staff a hard copy of the Guidelines on Academic Honesty. Those forms\nare handed out at the first lecture, but ask a TA if you need another form.\n\n1.00/1.001/1.002\nProblem Set 0\n2/9\n\n1.00/1.001/1.002\nProblem Set 0\n3/9\nProblem 2: Sign Up for Recitation Section\n\nAll 1.00/1.001/1.002 students are required to sign up for a recitation section.\nSection assignments are on a first come first served basis, so please sign up as\nsoon as possible, after 8pm on Wednesday February 8. For detailed section\nassignments, please go to the course website.\n\nRecitations will last one hour and are held only on Mondays and Tuesdays. There is a\nmaximum capacity of 12 students in each section.\n\nBecause recitation capacity is limited, sign up as soon as possible.\nOnce you have joined a recitation section, you will be able to submit and download\nhomework in that section.\n\nYou must attend the first class of recitation section you signed up, which is either\non Monday, February 13 or Tuesday, February 14. If you decide to switch\nsections, you will only be able to do so through Wednesday, February 22.\n\n1.00/1.001/1.002\nProblem Set 0\n4/9\nProblem 3: Introduction to Eclipse\n\nPlease install Java, then Eclipse. For details, refer to the „How to‟ documents, which\ncan be found on the 1.00 website. Contact your TA for any installation problem.\n\nStep 1 - Start Eclipse\n\nIf you followed the „How to‟, you should have an Eclipse shortcut on your desktop.\nDouble-click this icon and an Eclipse splash screen should appear while the program\nis loading. Or, you may double click on the Eclipse executable file. This file is located\nin the folder where you installed Eclipse. (You can create a shortcut to the Eclipse\nexecutable by right-clicking and dragging it to your desktop, where it will appear as an\nicon.)\n\nStep 2 - Creating a new project\n\nIn Eclipse, projects are used in order to organize the files in a program. The project\nwill include all the needed files for the program to run. To create a new project,\nchoose File New Project. A „New Project‟ screen will appear:\n\nCourtesy of The Eclipse Foundation. Used with permission.\nMake sure 'Java Project' is highlighted. After clicking 'Next', a 'New Java Project'\nscreen will appear:\n\n1.00/1.001/1.002\nProblem Set 0\n5/9\nCourtesy of The Eclipse Foundation. Used with permission.\n\nUnder „Project name‟, type „ProblemSet0‟.\n\nWe strongly recommend that you choose the \"Create project in workspace\" option,\nwhich will place your work in the folder:\n\nFor Windows 7/ Vista: C:\\Users\\<username>\\workspace\\\nFor Mac:\n\n/Users/<username>/Documents/workspace/\nFor Linux:\n\n/home/<username>/Documents/workspace/\n\nWhen you are done, click „Finish‟. If a dialog box appears, check the \"Do not show this\nmessage again\" box and hit „Yes‟.\n\nStep 3 - Creating your first class\n\nSelect File New Class, or click on the „NEW‟ icon,\n, then select class and hit\n„Next‟. On the „New Java Class‟ screen, type the name of the class, HelloWorld, in the\nName field and check the „public static void main(String[ ] args)‟. Don‟t worry about\nother options on the screen for now.\n\nCourtesy of The Eclipse Foundation. Used with permission.\n\nStep 4 - HelloWorld.java\n\nEclipse will create and open a new file named „HelloWorld.java‟. Add one line of\nJava code to the main() method so that it looks like:\n\npublic static void main(String[] args)\n{\nSystem.out.println(\"Hello world!\"); // Add this line\n}\n\nSave the edited version of HelloWorld.java by selecting File Save, or by clicking\non the save icon. Eclipse automatically compiles the file when it is saved. As you\nwrite longer programs in future problem sets, remember to save each file within the\nprogram as you write or edit it; otherwise other files that reference it will appear not to\nsee it, or not to see your latest changes.\n\n1.00/1.001/1.002\nProblem Set 0\n6/9\n\nStep 5 - Running the HelloWorld class\n\n1) From the Eclipse menu, Select Run Run As Java Application.\n2) Because we‟ve edited the program, Eclipse prompts us to save our changes before\nit runs the program. Click Ok.\n3) The Console displays our program output.\nCourtesy of The Eclipse Foundation. Used with permission.\n\nStep 6 - Checking your program\n\nYou are not done writing your program until you have checked it by examining its status\nas it proceeds from start to end, making sure that all variables and expressions have\ntheir intended values and behavior at each step.\n\nTo check (or, in the old-fashioned terminology used by Eclipse, debug) our program, we\nneed to set a breakpoint in our code so the program suspends execution and allows us\nto see its status. Without a breakpoint, the program will run to completion without letting\nus look at its status. To set a breakpoint, double-click in the gray margin on the left side\nof the editor next to the line at which you‟d like program execution to stop. A blue dot will\nappear, indicating an active breakpoint. In this example, set the breakpoint at the line\nwith System.out.println(...)\n\nStarting the program to check is similar to running it. Eclipse provides two options: Use\nthe full-service Run Debug menu selection to use a launch configuration, or use the\nexpress Run Debug As Java Application selection if the default options are OK.\nUse the Run Step Over or Run Step Into commands to step line by line through\nyour program. (We‟ll describe this in more detail in lecture.)\n1.00/1.001/1.002\nProblem Set 0\n7/9\n\n1.00/1.001/1.002\nProblem Set 0\n8/9\n\nEclipse will show you the values of all variables, expressions, and other program\nstatus. There‟s not much of it here, but there will be plenty even in Problem Set 1.\n\nCongratulations! You have just written your first Java program.\n\nMore Information on Eclipse\n\nEclipse documentation, including a „Getting Started‟ section can be found at:\nhttp://help.eclipse.org/ganymede/index.jsp. This offers a more detailed recitation than\nwhat we‟ve laid out here.\n\nCourtesy of The Eclipse Foundation. Used with permission.\n\n1.00/1.001/1.002\nProblem Set 0\n9/9\nProblem 4: Submitting Problem Set 0\n\nFor each problem set, you will electronically submit your Java code through our website.\nYou do not have to submit a printed copy of your homework.\n\nTo test that you understand homework submissions, try submitting HelloWorld.java\nas your solution to Problem Set 0. To do this, follow the instructions in the document\n„How to Submit Assignments.‟ This document can be found on the course website.\nBring any questions or problems to your first recitation.\n\nPlease make sure you know how to submit your homework before recitation. If\nyou have any questions, bring them up during your first recitation or office hours.\n\nTurn In\n\n-\nTurn in electronic copies of all source code (.java files). No printed copies\nare required.\n\n-\nPlace a comment with your full name, recitation section, TA‟s\nname, and assignment number at the beginning of all .java files in your solution.\nComments begin with a double slash (//).\n\n-\nPlace all of the files in your solution into a single zip file. Submit this single zip\nfile on the 1.00 Web site under the appropriate section and problem set number.\nFor directions, see 'How to Submit Assignments' on the 1.00 Web site.\n\n-\nYour solution is due at 12 noon.

We will calculate the\nvalues of electromagnetic phenomena associated with antennae, when provided with the values\nof different parameters. We simplify the physics and don't state all the assumptions, though\nthose of you who took 8.02 can refer to your past notes for more background. The background is\nnot necessary to complete this assignment; we provide all definitions for the calculations that are\nrequired.\nMagnetic Inductance\n\nIn this homework, we will calculate the magnetic inductance of three types of antennae: line,\ncoil, and rectangular. The magnetic inductance equation for each is provided below.\n\nLine Antenna\nThe magnetic inductance around a straight, linear antenna is (Equation 1):\n\n//\nB =\n\n2nr\n\nwhere\n\nB= magnetic inductance (volt-seconds per meter squared)\n\nμ= magnetic field constant (1.257 x 10-6 volt-seconds/ampere)\n\nI= current (amperes)\n\nr= distance from antenna (meters)\n\nIn this problem set, we will work with line antennae that receive 10mA of current.\nCoil Antenna\nThe magnetic inductance along the center line of a round coil antenna is (Equation 2):\n\n/\nB =\n\nwhere\n\nN= number of windings\n\nR= radius (meters)\n1/5\n\nL\nin\ne\ns\n\no\nf\n\nm\nagnetic flux around a cylindrical coil.\n\nx= distance from the center of the coil along the (vertical) center line; see the figure.\nWe assume the windings are spaced very closely; the figure exaggerates the spacing.\nIn this problem set we will work with coil antennae that have a current of 20mA.\nwhere\n\na= width of antenna (meters)\n\nb= length of antenna (meters)\n\nI= current (amperes)\n\nx=distance from antenna (meters)\n\nN=number of windings\n\nIn this problem set we will work with rectangular antennae that have a current of 30mA and only\nhave 1 winding.\n\nMutual Inductance\n\nWe will also calculate the mutual inductance of two combinations of antennae: two coil\nantennae, and a rectangular antenna adjacent to a straight antenna.\n\nTwo Coil Antennae\nThe mutual inductance of two coil antennae is given by (Equation 4):\n2/5\n\nImage by MIT OpenCourseWare.

Adapted from Figure 4.8 Finkenzeller,\nKlaus (2003). RFID Handbook (2nd Edition). Wiley.\n(FIGURE FROM FINKENZELLER)\n\nIn this problem set, when working with one coil antenna (when measuring magnetic inductance),\nwe will assume that it has:\nN1 = 100 windings\nR1 = 0.1m\n\nWhen working with a second antenna (when measuring mutual inductance) we will assume the\nsecond antenna has the following characteristics:\nN2 = 200 windings\nR2 = 0.15m\n\nRectangular Antenna adjacent to a Line Antenna\nThe mutual inductance of a line antenna and a rectangular antenna is given by (Equation 5):\n\nwhere\n! = !\"\n!\n2! ln ( + !\n!\n)\n!!\n!!\n\n!!!\nwhere\n!!!!!\n\nM = mutual inductance (volts-seconds per meter squared)\n! =\nN1 = number of windings in the smaller coil antenna 1\n2 (!!\n! + !!)!\nR1 = radius of the smaller coil antenna 1 (meters)\nN2 = number of windings in the larger coil antenna 2\nR2 = radius of the larger coil antenna 2 (meters)\n\nx= distance between the two coil antennae (meters)\n\nThe two coil antennae are in the same plane and nearby, as shown in the figure below.\n\nYou must calculate these different inductances for the antennae we have described (line, coil and\nrectangle). The calculations that you must implement are:\n- Line antenna:\no Compute magnetic inductance (equation 1)\n- Coil antenna:\no Compute magnetic inductance (equation 2)\no Compute mutual inductance with another coil antenna (equation 4)\n- Rectangle antenna:\no Compute magnetic inductance (equation 3)\no Compute mutual inductance with a line antenna (equation 5)\nOnly some of these calculations will need to be done - depending on the type of antenna\n2. Program\n\na= dimension of rectangle antenna parallel to line antenna (meters); assume this is also\nthe width of the antenna in equation 3.\nb= dimension of rectangle antenna perpendicular to line antenna (meters); assume this is\nalso the length of the antenna in equation 3.\nx= distance between rectangle antenna and line antenna (meters)\nSee the figure below.\nIn this assignment we have a rectangle antenna with the following specifications:\na= 0.3m\nb= 0.2m\n4/5\n\nYour program should:\n1. Allow the user to specify an antenna type using a JOptionPane.\n2. Given the selected antenna, prompt the user to enter a minimum and maximum distance\nvalue for the antenna type, r in equation 1, x in equations 2-5.\n3. With these user inputs, compute the associated inductance value(s) using the values\nprovided above. If either a coil or rectangle antenna is selected, both magnetic and mutu\ninductance should be computed at each distance value.\n4. Calculate and print the inductances for a range of distance values in 0.05m increments\nbetween the minimum and maximum distances.\n5. Prompt the user with a JOptionPane to either enter new inputs or quit. If the user\nchooses to enter new inputs, the program should start again from the beginning.\n\nal\nTurn In\nFor this problem set:\na.

      "content": "Page 1 of 3\nIntroduction to Computers and Engineering Problem Solving\nSpring 2011\nProblem Set 2: Throwing a ball into a basket\nDue: 12 noon, February 24, 2012\nProblem statement\nYou learn in physics that projectiles follow a\nparabolic path through the air, due to the\nacceleration of gravity. In this problem set,\nyou will calculate the release angles and\nspeeds for throwing a ball into a basket.\nThe kinematic equations lead to an equation\ndescribing the relationship between release\nangle, θ, initial speed, v0, and distance, d:\nV2 sin 2e\nd =\n\ng\nwhere g = 9.8 m/s2 is the acceleration due to gravity. Let's assume you always throw the ball\nwith the same initial speed, v0, each time. There will then be a small range of angles at which the\nball can be released and still land within the diameter of the basket.\nIn order to ensure the ball doesn't hit the ceiling, we will also look at its maximum height, h, at\nthe top of the trajectory, given by:\n\nV2 sin2 e\no\n\nh =\n\n2g\nProgram\nDesign a Java class with a set of static methods to compute the optimal release angle, and the\nrange of acceptable angles, in order to toss a ball into a basket from a given distance. Your class\nwill have a main()method that will prompt the user for inputs, call the static methods to\nperform the calculations, and print the results. None of the calculations should be performed\ndirectly by the main() method.\nYour program should prompt the user for the following inputs:\n- distance, d, from thrower's hand to the center of the basket (in meters)\n- diameter of the basket (in meters)\n- initial ball speed v0 (in meters/second)\n- height of the ceiling from the basket (in meters)\nAssume that the ball is thrown exactly along the x axis. The size of the ball is much smaller than\nthe size of the basket, so you may ignore it. Trajectory of ball thrown into basket.\nh\nd\nvo\nθ\nx\ny\nImage by MIT OpenCourseWare.\n\nPage 2 of 3\nWhen all the parameters have been entered correctly, your main() method should call a\nseparate static method to perform each of the following:\n1) Compute the optimal angle (in degrees) for releasing the ball, such that it lands in the\ncenter of the basket. Note that the trajectory angle equation is in radians.\n2) Compute the smallest angle (in degrees) that will still land the ball in the basket. Assume\nthe ball will go into the basket if the center of the ball hits the edge. You should not\nrewrite the contents of any methods you have already written.\n3) Compute the largest angle (in degrees) that will still land the ball in the basket. You\nshould not rewrite the contents of any methods you have already written.\n4) Determine whether or not the ball will hit the ceiling when thrown at the optimal angle.\n5) If the ball will hit the ceiling, you will need to throw the ball faster. Write a method that\ncontinuously increments the initial v0 by 0.1 and re-computes the angle and max height,\nuntil the height constraint is met. You should not rewrite the contents of any methods you\nhave already written. This method only needs to print to the console all the different\nvalues of v0 and θ that are tried, and what max heights they corresponded to.\n\nPrint each of these results from the main() method. You may find built-in methods in the\nMath class useful for computing trigonometric values (for example, Math.cos(double a)\ncomputes the cosine of an angle in radians). A list of available methods is found here:\nhttp://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/Math.html\n\nExample Calculations and Outputs:\nConsider a 10cm diameter basket located 2m from the thrower, an initial speed of 5 m/s and a\nceiling height of 2m. Your program should print approximately the following. Do not worry\nabout numerical formatting.\n\nOptimal angle 25.814 degrees.\nRange of acceptable angles is from 24.927 degrees to 26.738 degrees.\nThe maximum height of the ball is 0.242 meters.\nWill the ball hit the ceiling? false\n\nIf we now move the basket to 15m from the thrower and throw the ball at an initial speed of 13\nm/s, the program should print approximately the following. Again, do not worry about numerical\nformatting.\n\nOptimal angle 30.219 degrees.\nRange of acceptable angles is from 30.052 degrees to 30.388 degrees.\nThe maximum height of the ball is 2.184m.\nWill the ball hit the ceiling? true\nTrying v0 13.1 mis, theta 29.468 degrees. Max height 2.119 meters\nTrying v0 13.2 mis, theta 28.765 degrees. Max height 2.059 meters\nTrying v0 13.3 mis, theta 28.102 degrees. Max height 2.002 meters\nTrying v0 13.4 mis, theta 27.476 degrees. Max height 1.950 meters\n\nPage 3 of 3\nTurn In\n1.

      "content": "Introduction to Computers and Engineering Problem Solving\nSpring 2012\nProblem Set 5: MBTA routes\nDue: 12 noon, Friday, March 23\n\nProblem statement\n\na. Overview\n\nThe Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) operates routes using three basic\ntechnologies:\n- Buses, which operate as single units with a driver\n- Urban rail, such as the Red, Orange, Blue and Green Lines, which operate trains\nconsisting of individual, powered cars; a train has an operator and may have additional\non-train staff.\n- Commuter rail, such as lines to Lowell or Providence, which operate trains consisting of\none engine and a number of unpowered cars; a train has an engineer in the engine, and\nadditional staff on the cars.\n\nA route must operate on at least one right-of-way (ROW) type:\n- Dedicated right of way, which has tracks or a busway separated from the street system,\nand stops only at stations. Most urban rail, some bus, and all commuter rail routes\noperate on a dedicated ROW.\n- Shared right of way, which operate together with or near private vehicle traffic on streets.\nMost bus routes and some urban rail routes operate on a shared ROW.\n- Mixed right of way, which is a hybrid of dedicated and shared. For example, the Silver\nLine bus to the airport operates in its own tunnel at South Station, which is a dedicated\nright of way, as well as on public streets to and from the airport, which is a shared right\nof way. Green Line routes operate on shared right of way at their outer ends, as well as in\ndedicated right of way (tunnel) on their inner portions.\n\nFor this homework, you will design and implement a set of classes and interfaces and use them\nto calculate the MBTA's resource requirements. Your classes will be quite short and will have\nlittle computation. You would generally not use a full inheritance structure for a problem this\nsimple, but if you were computing everything that the MBTA monitors on each route, this\nstructure would be appropriate. This homework can be viewed as the initial design for a much\nlarger system.\n\nb. Data members\n\nEach route has the following data:\n- Route name (String).\n- L= route length (double, miles)\n1/5\n\n- v= average speed (double, mph)\n- h= headway, or interval between buses or trains (double, minutes)\nEvery bus or train on a route has one operator: bus driver, urban rail operator, or commuter train\nengineer.\n\nEach urban rail route and commuter rail route has additional data members:\n- c= train length, measured in the number of vehicles in a train, assumed constant all day\n(int)\n- k= number of additional staff per train (e.g., conductors, ticket collectors) (int)\nBus routes have no data members for these items; there are no trains or extra staff on buses.\n\nEach route with dedicated right of way has, in addition:\n- b= number of stations (int)\n- m= number of staff per station (int)\n\nEach route with shared right of way has, in addition:\n- a= number of stops (int); these are very simple, and are different than stations\n- d= additional vehicles assigned to the route because of traffic delays; this is expressed as\na multiplier from a base, e.g., 1.25 (double).\n\nc. Methods: getVehicles() and getEngines()\n\nFor each route, you must implement a method called getVehicles(), which computes the number\nof vehicles required using the following equation:\n\ne = 2 * 60 * L * c * dj (v * h)\n(buses, urban rail cars, commuter rail cars)\nThe factor of 2 is because vehicles operate round trip on the route, and the factor of 60 converts\nbetween speed (mph) and headway (minutes) units. For buses, where the bus is a single unit,\nomit variable c in the equation above. For dedicated right of way services, omit d. (Do not just\nset c=1 or d=1.) For hybrid right of way services, do not omit d.\n\nAdditionally, each commuter rail route must have a method getEngines(), which returns the\nnumber of engines using an equation that is similar to the equation above. For commuter rail\nengines, since there is one engine per train, omit variable c in the equation above. Also, For\ndedicated right of way services, omit d. (Again, do not just set c=1 or d=1.) Therefore, commuter\nrail routes will have both a getVehicles() and a getEngines() method. getEngines() is:\n\ne\n=\n* 60 * L\nj (v * h)\n(commuter rail engines)\n\nd. Method: getStaff()\n\nFor each route, you must have a method getStaff(), which computes the number of staff as the\nsum of the number of operators, other train staff, and station staff\n\nThe number of operators f for a bus, urban rail, or commuter rail route is:\n2/5\n\nf = ejc\n\n(urban rail routes)\n\nf = e1\n\n(commuter rail routes)\n\nf = e\n\n(bus routes)\n\nThe number of other staff g on the train for urban rail and commuter rail is:\n\n*\ng =\n\nc\n\n(urban rail routes)\n\ng = k * e\n\n(commuter rail routes)\n\nwhere k is specific to each route, as shown in the table below, and is not defined for bus.\n\nThe number of station staff j for bus, urban rail or commuter rail routes that operate on a\ndedicated ROW is:\n\nj= b*m\n(for any route with a dedicated ROW)\n\nThe getStaff() method returns n= f + g + j.\n\ne. Data values\n\nYou are asked to calculate and output the number of vehicles required and the number of staff\nrequired for five MBTA routes using the data in the table below. \"na\" means not applicable.\n\nVariable Definition\nBus 77\nSilver\nLine bus\nRed Line\nGreen\nB\nLine Lowell Line\nL\nRoute length\nv\nAvg speed\na\nNbr stops\nna\nna\nb\nNbr stations\nna\nh\nHeadway\nc\nTrain length\nna\nna\n5 cars,\n1 engine\n\nOperator/train\n1 driver\n1 driver\n1 operator\n1 operator\n1 engineer\nk\nAdditional\nstaff/train\nna\nna\n1 other\n1 other\n2 other\nm\nStaff/station\nna\nd\nAddl vehicles\n1.20\n1.15\nna\n1.25\nna\n\nRoute Type\nBus\nBus\nUrban\nUrban\nCommuter\n\nROW Type\nShared\nHybrid\nDedicated\nHybrid\nDedicated\n\nf. Program\n3/5\n\nYour program must meet the following guidelines:\n- You must use at least one abstract class, with appropriate abstract and final methods, and\nat least one interface; you may wish to have several abstract classes and interfaces. You\nmust have at least one abstract method and one final method in at least one class.\n- You may not represent the route type (bus, urban rail or commuter rail) or the right of\nway type (shared or dedicated) as a data member.\n- Each subclass must inherit its data and methods from a superclass or an interface to the\nmaximum extent possible. Override superclass methods as needed.\n- Each subclass must not contain data that is not relevant. For example, the Red Line may\nnot have stops or additional vehicles, and the 77 bus may not have stations, staff per train,\nvehicles per train, or staff per station. A subclass must not have any data marked \"na\" in\nthe table above. You may not set \"na\" variables equal to one in a subclass that does not\nuse them; they must not be present.\n- If a route type has a certain data member, your design must require that it be present. For\nexample, your design must require all shared ROW routes to have a number of stops. All\nurban rail and commuter rail routes must have a number of stations, staff/station and\nstaff/train.\no An interface cannot force an implementing class to have a data member, but if the\ninterface has a method getX(), the implementing method will need to either have a\ndata member X or compute X. This meets the requirement of the problem set.\n- You may use protected access for data members to be inherited by subclasses, except that\nany data member managed by a final method must be private.\n- Data members and methods must be defined in the highest level of the inheritance tree\npossible. For example, the data members that exist for all routes must be defined in a\nRoute class, not in BusRoute, UrbanRailRoute or CommuterRail classes.\no All of your methods will be very simple; they should all be just one line.\n- You must write classes or subclasses for the combinations of Route and ROW listed at\nthe in the table above. You should not write any other combination of Route and ROW.\no You do not need to have a class for bus routes just on dedicated ROW\no You do not need to have a class for urban rail routes just on shared ROW\n- You must write a class RouteTest with only a main() method to test your software. In\nmain(), write code to:\n- Create objects for five routes: bus 77, Silver Line/Airport, Red Line, Green Line B\nand Lowell Line\n- Compute and output (System.out.println) the number of vehicles and staff required\nfor each route, including the number of engines for commuter rail routes. You will\nhave fractional values, which is fine.\n- Output the number of stops and/or stations for each route.\n- Compute and output the total number of vehicles for bus routes, for urban rail routes\nand for commuter rail routes. (This will be three totals) You must use the instanceOf\nkeyword in your loop to determine what kind of vehicle is used on a route, since all\nroutes have the same getVehicle() method. Include commuter rail engines, using\ngetEngine().\n- Compute and output the total staff across all routes.\n4/5\n\n- Remember to let Eclipse help you.

      "content": "Introduction to Computers and Engineering Problem Solving\nSpring 2012\nProblem Sets 6 and 7: Antenna GUI\nDue: 12 noon, Friday, April 6, 2012 (Problem Set 6)\n\n12 noon, Friday, April 20, 2012 (Problem Set 7)\n\nProblem statement\n\nYou are to write a graphical user interface (GUI) to compute and display the magnetic\ninductance of line, coil and rectangular antennas. You'll do it in two stages, starting in\nhomework 6 and finishing in homework 7. We use exactly the same equations as in homework 1.\n\nYour GUI should resemble the picture below.\nRefer to homework 1 for the five equations for inductance of line, coil and rectangle antennae.\nYou must use the model-view-controller paradigm to write the GUI.\n1/4\n\nYou must design and write appropriate model classes, using inheritance to model the three types\nof antenna (line, coil and rectangle). The Antenna classes will contain the appropriate data\nmembers,set() ,and get() methods; they must not have extraneous data or methods that do not\napply to them. This is a generalization of the model-view-controller paradigm; in this homework\nyou will have multiple model classes.\n\nThe computational methods that you must implement are:\n- Line antenna:\no\nCompute magnetic inductance (equation 1)\n- Coil antenna:\no\nCompute magnetic inductance (equation 2)\no\nCompute mutual inductance with another coil antenna (equation 4)\n- Rectangle antenna:\no\nCompute magnetic inductance (equation 3)\no Compute mutual inductance with a line antenna (equation 5)\nThese methods take one argument, distance x, except for equation 4, which must also accept a\nreference to a second coil antenna. (In equation 1, the distance is r.)\n\nYou must also write a AntennaView class, which obtains all data and results from the model\nclasses needed to draw the antennas being analyzed, and to print the inductance computed from\nthe model. This class has a paintComponent() method as its key element. Its display should\ngenerally look like the figure above: it must show the relevant antennas and their characteristics.\n\nThird, you must write a AntennaController class. It must meet the following requirements:\n- It must have labels and text fields to allow the six inputs to be entered (current, number of\nwindings, coil radius, rectangle length and width, distance x), as appropriate\n- It must allow the user to select the analysis to be done; the 5 choices are the 5 equations.\nYou may use a combo box.\n- It must have \"Quit\" and \"Calculate\" buttons as shown in the figure above\n- It must use appropriate panels and layout managers to place the input components. Your\nGUI must resemble the example given above.\n- It must have appropriate anonymous inner classes as listeners for the buttons\no\nThe \"Calculate\" button listener should parse all the inputs, checking that all are\ngreater than zero, and set the model parameters to them. You may require all\ninputs to be present, even if the requested analysis does not use all of them, for\nsimplicity.\no\nThe \"Quit\" button should end the application.\n\nYour program must be a model-view-controller implementation. The model classes (Antenna\nand others) will perform the calculations. A view class (AntennaView) will draw the antennas\nand display the results of the calculations. A controller class (AntennaController) will\nallow user input and control program execution. As you develop your classes, keep in mind how\nthe model(s), the view and the controller need to interact.\n\n2/4\n\nUse the sample output and solution from homework 1 to check your model results.\n\nProblem Set 6\n\n1. Models\nWrite the Antenna classes to implement the equations. The classes must have appropriate\ndata members and methods to be used as the models in your final program. The controller\n(problem set 7) will need to transfer user input to the models. The view (problem set 7) will\nhave to get all the necessary data from the models to draw the antennas and display the\nanalysis results.\n\n2. Controller\nCreate a class AntennaController that extends JFrame.\na. The class should have the appropriate textboxes, combo box, and buttons displayed and\nfunctional. Use anonymous inner classes to listen for events.\nb. No antennas need to be drawn yet, and no analysis outputs need to be displayed. For now,\nyou may insert an empty JPanel in that area.\nc. The class should have a main(String[] args) method that creates and displays an\ninstance of the class.\nHand in the Antenna classes and the AntennaController class to complete problem set 6.\nYour program should work except that nothing is drawn or output when it is run.\n\nProblem Set 7\n\n3. View\nWrite a class AntennaView that extends JPanel.\na. You may set a fixed size for the panel.\nb. Apart from the constructor and perhaps a set() method, the only public method in this\nclass should be paintComponent(Graphics g), which draws the antenna(s) and\ndisplays the analysis results. It obtains the data values it needs by calling methods on the\nmodel classes. You are free to make changes to your model and controller classes from\nthose that you handed in for problem set 6. The antennas must be drawn approximately to\nscale.\n\nTo complete problem set 7, hand in the Antenna model classes, AntennaView, and\nAntennaController classes that make up the complete application.\n\n3/4\n\nTurn In\nFor each problem set:\na. Place a comment with your full name, section, TA name and assignment number\nat the beginning of all .java files in your solution.\n\nb. Place all of the files in your solution in a single zip file.\n\nc. Do not turn in electronic or printed copies of compiled byte code (.class files) or backup\nsource code\n\n(.java~ files)\nd. Do not turn in printed copies of your solution.\n\n2. Submit this single zip file on the 1.00 Web site under the appropriate section and problem set\nnumber.\n\nFor directions see How To: Submit Homework on the 1.00 Web site.\n3. Your solution is due at noon. Your uploaded files should have a timestamp of no later than\nnoon on the due date.\n\n4. After you submit your solution, please recheck that you submitted your .java file. If you\n\nsubmitted your .class file, you will receive\n\nzero credit.\nPenalties\nFor each problem set:\n\n- 30 points off if you turn in your problem set after Friday noon but before noon on the\nfollowing Monday. You have one no-penalty late submission per term for a turn-in after\nFriday noon and before Monday noon.\n- Problem set 6 is due Wednesday noon because of a Friday holiday.

      "content": "Introduction to Computers and Engineering Problem Solving\nSpring 2012\nProblem Set 8: Rail switching\nDue: 12 noon, Friday, April 27, 2012\n1. Problem Statement\nRailroads use radio remote control systems for an operator on the ground to control\nengines switching cars in a rail yard. We will simulate a simple version of such a system\nin this homework, which will have just one track, one railroad car, and one engine. Your\nprogram will allow remote control of the engine speed, direction and coupling to a car. It\nmust have a safety feature that stops the engine if it detects a lighted object in its range,\nsuch as a car with an end marker.\nYou should base your program on the Phidget and Swing vehicle application from\nlecture, although you will need to make substantial modifications:\n- The slider sensor must control engine speed in either direction. A value near the\nmiddle is zero mph; allow a range (e.g., 450 to 550) to be zero speed. The high\nrange (550 to 1000) indicates positive speeds and the low range (0-450) indicates\nnegative speeds (going backwards). The GUI must show the engine moving\nacross the display.\n- You will have to keep moving the slider sensor to keep generating events so that\nthe engine keeps moving. This feature exists in real systems, and is both an\nannoyance and a safety feature: if the operator is incapacitated, the engine will\nstop.\n- The force sensor must be used to couple or uncouple a car from the engine. The\ncar and engine must be adjacent to be coupled or uncoupled, and the speed of the\nengine must be zero. Use a force threshold of 300.\n- The light sensor must be used to initiate an emergency stop. Cars and employees\nhave reflective surfaces and the engine has lights and a light sensor that detects\nreflected light. When the light sensor detects a high light reading, the engine\nspeed is immediately set to zero. The engine can be restarted only after the light\nsensor reading is low. Use a light sensor threshold of 300.\nIn a real system, you would use the Phidgets digital outputs to send digital signals to\ncontrol the engine. These are being simulated by calls to repaint() in the GUI in this\nhomework.\nThe figure below is a very simple example of the GUI. The engine is red, the car is black,\nand the track is blue. The figure shows the starting position, with the engine and car\nseparated. In the solution GUI, the car and engine are \"filled\" (rather than drawn) when\nthey are coupled. You must indicate when the car and engine are coupled, but you may\ndo it in any way that you wish.\n1.00 Spring 2012\n1/5\nProblem Set 8\n\nInitial position:\nAfter coupling:\nAfter the engine pulls and then decouples from the car:\n2. Program\nUse the basic structure from the vehicle example in lecture 26.\n- The GUI must show at least the track, the engine, and the car.\n- The display must show the location, direction and speed of the engine. No text is\nrequired; the display must show the movements of the engine and car.\n- After the engine has approached within a meter/pixel of the car, it can then be\ncoupled to the car by pushing the force sensor, but not otherwise.\n- When the engine and car are touching each other but are not coupled, moving the\nengine in the direction of the car should cause neither the engine nor the car to move.\n- The engine can be coupled to or uncoupled from the car by pushing the force sensor\nonly when the engine is stationary (i.e., only when the slider value is between 450 and\n550). Commands for coupling or uncoupling must be ignored when slider has a value\noutside the 450-550 range.\n· You may get multiple coupling events when pushing the force sensor, since it\nwill generate a number of events at similar pressure values. Implement a simple\nway to limit this problem if you can see one; it's ok if the user needs to push the\nforce sensor a few times.\n- Your engine and car must stay on the track segments shown in the GUI. If they hit\nthe end of track, speed is set to zero. Have your track go from x=100 to x=800.\n- The GUI can be quite simple--it does not need to be beautiful, just functional.\n1.00 Spring 2012\n2/5\nProblem Set 8\n\n- Your application must use a model-view-controller pattern. The view just does the\ndrawing, as shown in the examples. The model computes speeds, locations, coupling,\netc. The controller draws the frame, opens and closes the Phidgets interface kit, and\nhandles sensor events. The controller should have a \"quit\" button so that the text file\nbeing written (see below) can be closed correctly.\nYou must write the key events from your simulation to a text file using a Java stream. Let\nthe x location of engine or car be its leftmost coordinate. You must write the following\ndata to the text file:\n- The engine's x location of any coupling event and uncoupling event.\n- The x location if the engine hits the start of the track.\n- The x location if the car hits the end of the track.\n- The engine's x location and sensor value of any light event that causes the engine\nto stop.\n- The final x locations of both engine and car.\nDecide the appropriate method and class design to write these events. Also:\n- Write the event type as well as the required data.\n- Call the file HW8Out.txt.\n- Minimize the number of duplicate entries in the text file. Use booleans to detect\nwhen you're in a given state, and only write to the text file when the state changes\n(e.g., if you're at end of track and stay there, write that event only once).\nWhen you run your program you must:\n- Move the engine next to the car.\n- Couple to the car.\n- Go to the right end of track.\n- Go to the left end of track.\n- Go back toward the center of the track.\n- Uncouple from the car.\n- Move the engine to the left, and stop it with a light sensor event.\nThese events must be recorded in the text file that you submit.\nYour sensors must be on the following analog ports:\n1. Force sensor\n2. (Rotation sensor--used only in extra credit)\n3. Light sensor\n4. Slider\nWe will deduct points if your sensors are not on these ports. (We need to be able to grade\nyour submissions on our test setup efficiently.)\nSample output is shown below. Yours will be different, based on how you manipulate\nyour sensors:\n1.00 Spring 2012\n3/5\nProblem Set 8\n\nCoupled at: 600\nEngine and car at end of track: 720\nEngine at start of track: 100\nUncoupled at: 394\nEngine at start of track: 100\nLight event: 205\nLast position of engine: 205\nLast position of car: 394\n3. Extra Credit\nIn addition to your solution above, you may implement additional functionality for this\nproblem set and get up to 40 extra credit points. You must first complete and submit\nthe entire standard solution as outlined above. Do not attempt to develop the extra\ncredit solution until you have completed the normal assignment since it will be graded\nseparately. When you submit your solution to the 1.00 Web site, first submit your\noriginal solution. Then upload your extra credit solution as a second .zip file. Both\nversions should contain all the files needed to compile and run your solution.\nYou can get extra credit on only one homework from problem sets 8 to 10. If you\ndon't have time do to the extra credit this time, you still have the opportunity to do so in\nthe future.\nFor extra credit, your program must have two cars on the track in addition to the engine.\nThe user must be able to couple and uncouple either of them, one at a time, with remote\ncontrol. Use the rotation sensor to select which car to couple or uncouple; place it on\nanalog port 2. Connect two LEDs to digital output ports 1 and 2, and turn the first LED\non if and only if engine and the first car are coupled; turn the second LED on if and only\nif the two cars are coupled. When you write the events to the text file, include which car\nis being coupled or uncoupled.\nFor the extra credit problem we provide images of the engine and car. See the homework\n8 download zip file. Instead of drawing rectangles, you must render pictures of the engine\nand cars and move them around. You are welcome to use your own images.\nImages courtesy of Ken Houghton Rail Images, via http://www.rrhistorical.com/\n1.00 Spring 2012\n4/5\nProblem Set 8\n\nFor methods of image loading and rendering, see online documentation at:\nhttp://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/2d/images/index.html\nBelow is a snapshot of an engine and two cars when the engine and the first car are\ncoupled. You are welcome to add any additional cool features.\nTurn In\n1.

Implement the Comparable interface for this\nclass. The sort order should be first alphabetically by author, then by number of pages\n(largest number first), and then by book height (largest height first). Use the generic\nversion of the Comparable interface.\n\npublic class Book implements Comparable<Book> {\n\nprivate double height;\n\nprivate int pages;\n\nprivate String author;\n\nprivate String title;\n\npublic Book(String title, String author, double height,\nint pages){\n\nthis.title=title;\n\nthis.author=author;\n\nthis.height=height;\n\nthis.pages=pages;\n\n}\n\npublic double getHeight() {return height;}\n\npublic int getPages() {return pages;}\n\npublic String getAuthor() {return author;}\n\npublic String getTitle() {return title;}\n\npublic int compareTo(Book b){\n\n}\n}\n\n1.00/1.001 - Fall 2010 - Final Exam\n3 / 15\n\nQuestion 2 - Recursion (10 points)\n\nA less known contemporary of Fibonacci, Notsofibbi, invented a new sequence to make\nhimself famous. In this sequence, each term is the product of the preceding two terms.\nThe first terms of the Notsofibbi sequence are therefore: 2, 3, 6, 18, 108, 1944...\n\nComplete the notso(int n) method, which returns the nth Notsofibbi number using a\nrecursive algorithm. The sequence starts at index 0, which means that:\n\nnotso(0) returns 2\n\nnotso(1) returns 3\n\n...\n\nYou may assume that the method is always called with a non-negative integer\nargument.\n\npublic static int notso(int n){\n\n}\n\n1.00/1.001 - Fall 2010 - Final Exam\n4 / 15\nQuestion 3 - Class design (30 points)\n\nWe want to model a store. Someone has already written the following abstract Item\nclass:\n\npublic abstract class Item {\n\nprotected int id;\n\nprotected double price; // what a customer pays a store\n\nprotected double cost; // cost of producing an item\n\npublic Item(int i, double p, double c){\n\nid = i;\n\nprice = p;\n\ncost = c;\n\n}\n\npublic double getProfit() {return price - cost;}\n\npublic int getId() {return id;}\n\npublic abstract void checkItem();\n}\n\n3.a\nMany items in a store are perishable. Write an interface called Perishable that\ndefines a \"near expiration\" threshold NEAREXP to be 3 days, and a boolean\nmethod called nearExpired() that determines if something should be marked\nas being near expiration.\n\n1.00/1.001 - Fall 2010 - Final Exam\n5 / 15\n3.b\nNext, we want to model food items, which are perishable. Write a class Food that\ninherits from the code above. A Food object should keep track of its ID, price,\ncost, shelf life, and the number of days it has already spent on the store's shelf. A\nfood item's shelf life is always 10 days in this problem. All other values are\nassigned from the constructor's parameters. Allow future classes to inherit data\nmembers in Food.\n\nImplement all necessary methods in the Food class. If a food item is within\nNEAREXP days of its shelf life, it is marked as near expired. When a store\nmanager \"checks\" a food item, a food item that is marked near expired will be\nsold at a 20% discount.\n\npublic class Food\n\n{\n\n1.00/1.001 - Fall 2010 - Final Exam\n6 / 15\n3.c\nNow create a new class called Fruit. A fruit is a type of food, so inherit\nappropriately. When checking a fruit, if the fruit is near expired, its price will be\nreduced by half.\n\npublic class Fruit\n\n{\n\n}\n\n3.d\nThe store also sells electronics. All electronics in this store come with batteries.\nWhen checking an electronic item, if the battery capacity of the item is below\n1500 mAh, then the price of the item is discounted by $2. Fill in the code below\nwith the necessary methods. The battery capacity data member should be\nassigned from a parameter given to the constructor.\n\npublic class Electronics extends Item {\n\nprivate double battCap;\n\n}\n\n1.00/1.001 - Fall 2010 - Final Exam\n7 / 15\n3.e\nWe will now implement a store. This store currently sells only three items: an\napple (with ID 4001, price of $0.60, cost of $0.10, and having been on the shelf\nfor 6 days), a box of cereal (with ID 4002, price of $4.00, cost of $0.20, and\nhaving been on the shelf for 8 days), and a flashlight (with ID 9001, price of\n$10.00, cost of $5.00, and capacity of 2500 mAh). Add all items to the inventory.\nThen write the code that goes through the inventory, checks every item,\ncomputes the profit subtotal, and if it is perishable, prints out its ID and whether it\nis near expiration or not. Finally, print out the total store profit if everything sells\ntoday.\n\npublic class StoreTest {\n\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n\nArrayList<Item> inventory = new ArrayList<Item>();\n\ninventory.add(new\n\n);\n\ninventory.add(new\n\n);\n\ninventory.add(new\n\n);\n\n}\n}\n\n1.00/1.001 - Fall 2010 - Final Exam\n8 / 15\nQuestion 4 - Dot Product (20 points)\n\nIn this question, you will implement a method to find the transpose of a matrix and a\nmethod to compute the dot product of two matrices. Recall the matrix class from lecture:\n\npublic class Matrix {\n\nprivate double[][] data;\n\npublic Matrix(int m, int n) {data = new double[m][n];}\n\npublic int getNumRows() {return data.length;}\n\npublic int getNumCols() {return data[0].length;}\n\npublic double getElement(int i, int j) {return data[i][j];}\n\npublic void setElement(int i, int j, double val) {\n\ndata[i][j] = val;\n\n}\n\npublic Matrix mult(Matrix b) {\n\nMatrix result = null;\n\nint nrows = data.length;\n\nint ncols = data[0].length;\n\nif(ncols == b.data.length) {\n\nresult = new Matrix(nrows, b.data[0].length);\n\nfor(int i=0; i<nrows; i++)\n\nfor(int j=0; j<result.data[0].length; j++) {\n\ndouble t = 0.0;\n\nfor(int k=0; k < ncols; k++)\n\nt += data[i][k] * b.data[k][j];\n\nresult.data[i][j]= t;\n\n}\n\n}\n\nreturn result;\n\n}\n\npublic Matrix getTranspose(){\n\n//Code completed in Part a.\n\n}\n\npublic double getDotProduct(Matrix m){\n\n//Code completed in Part b.\n\n}\n}\n\n1.00/1.001 - Fall 2010 - Final Exam\n9 / 15\n4.a\n\nFirst, we will write a method to find the transpose of a matrix.\n\nA matrix transpose can be found by writing the rows of a matrix as the columns of its\ntranspose. For example:\n\n.\n\nComplete the method getTranspose() that finds the transpose of a Matrix.

The start and end times are\nrepresented as integers (e.g. 1030 means 10:30am, 1500 means 3:00pm). The list of\nevents is maintained in chronological order, with the earliest event first in the list. In this\nproblem, we assume that there is no time conflict between events: two events may be\nscheduled back-to-back, but they never overlap. The list only contains events for one\nparticular day.\n\nEach task has a name, and a task may have a deadline. When a task has a deadline, it\nis convenient for the user to see the deadline in the schedule of events. To do this, an\nevent representing the deadline is added to the event list. Such an event has the same\nname as the task and has start and end times both equal to the task deadline. The task\nlist is in no particular order. Assume that task deadlines do not fall within oter events.\n\nIn the example below, an MIT student has an 8.02 lecture from 9am to 10:30am and a\n1.00 lecture from 3pm to 4:30pm. He/she has a 1.00 homework due at 12noon.

A graph refers to a collection of nodes and a collection of edges that connect pairs of\nnodes. Graphs are used to model many engineering problems, including communication and\ntransportation networks. Simple graphs can be described by a special type of matrix called an\nadjacency matrix.\n\nAn example graph is shown below. It contains 3 nodes, represented by circles with their index\nnumbers in them. The network also has 3 edges between nodes; the edges allow flow in both\ndirections. The matrix on the right is the node-to-node adjacency matrix for the graph. Every\nentry aij refers to the edge between node i and j, where aij = aji = 1 if the edge exists and 0 if it\ndoes not.\nThe node-to-node adjacency matrix of a simple graph is square and symmetric. Each edge is\nrepresented twice, once from i to j and once from j to i. Node 0 has a \"self loop\" in this example.\n\nThe Graph class is shown below; it is identical to class Matrix except that it holds ints, not\ndoubles.\n\npublic class Graph {\n\nprivate int[][] data;\n\npublic Graph(int n) {\n\ndata = new int[n][n];\n\n}\n\npublic int getNumRows() {\n\nreturn data.length;\n\n}\n\npublic int getNumCols() {\n\nreturn data[0].length;\n\n}\npublic int getElement(int i, int j) {\n\nreturn data[i][j];\n\n}\n\n// And many other methods, with ints rather than doubles\n} // End of Graph class\nG\nr\na\nph\ns\nc\nh\ne\nm\na\nt\ni\nc\n.\nImage by MIT OpenCourseWare.\n\n1.00/1.001 - Fall 2011 - Final Exam\n9 / 15\nWrite a method getNumEdges(int j) for the Graph class that returns the total number of\nedges connected to node j.

The\ncourse is a String; the student ID is an int. The delimiter is a comma. You do not know the\nlength of the file before you read all of it.\n\nYou are to write a program that:\n1. reads the file,\n2. counts the number of students registered in each course, and\n3. prints a list of all courses with their enrollment to the console.\nIn addition:\n1. Your program must handle any potential exceptions.\n2. Your program must use an appropriate data structure to keep track of the course\nregistrations, such as an array list, hash map or tree map.\n3. You may write all or most of your program in a main() method in your class, if you wish.\nYou may use a second class, if necessary. Give your class(es) descriptive name(s).\n4. You do not need to keep track of the courses that each student takes. You only need to\ncompute and output the number of students (enrollment) in each course.\n\n1.00/1.001 - Fall 2011 - Final Exam\n11 / 15\n\n1.00/1.001 - Fall 2011 - Final Exam\n12 / 15\n\n1.00/1.001 - Fall 2011 - Final Exam\n13 / 15\nQuestion 5 - Phidgets and Traffic Control (20 points)\n\nAs part of a research project, you will use Phidgets to implement various traffic signal control\npolicies at 77 Massachusetts Ave.\n\nCurrently, there are two signal phases:\n1. Phase A: Green signal for traffic flowing on Massachusetts Ave. and red light for\npedestrian crossing\n2. Phase B: Red signal for traffic flowing on Massachusetts Ave. and green light for\npedestrian crossing.\n\nFor simplicity we make the following assumptions.\n\n1. You do not need to consider the yellow light phase.\n2. Signal phases A and B alternate, with a total cycle time of 90 seconds and cycle split of\n2/3 for phase A and 1/3 for phase B. That is, phase A is on for 60 seconds, then phase B\nis on for 30 seconds, and so on...\n3. A push button for the pedestrian crossing will be added. When the button is pushed\nduring phase A and the remaining green time for traffic flowing on Massachusetts Ave. is\nmore than 30 seconds, pushing the button reduces that green time remaining to 30\nseconds for the current A phase.\n4. If the pedestrian button is pushed when there is less than 30 seconds of green time\nremaining in phase A, or in phase B, it has no effect.\n5. Phase A begins at time = 0 in your program.\n6. Assume the touch sensor generates an event reliably.\n\nA touch sensor is connected to port 0 on the input side of the Phidgets interface board. Four\nLEDs are connected to the output ports:\n\nLED Type\nOutput Port\nRepresenting\nRED\nRed signal for pedestrians, phase A (don't walk)\nGREEN\nGreen signal for traffic flow, phase A\nRED\nRed signal for traffic flow, phase B\nGREEN\nGreen signal for pedestrians, phase B (walk)\n\nYour task is to implement the signal system using Phidgets and Java.

Hasbro wants to hire you to build a version of Monopoly(r) that people\ncan play on their computers. Using your extensive 1.00 knowledge, you set out to\ncomplete this task.\n\nAssume you initially start with a Player class that simply holds a player's name. The\nclass isn't important for this question, but we provide the code just to be complete.\n\npublic class Player {\n\nprivate String name;\n\npublic Player(String name){ this.name = name; }\n\npublic String getName() { return name; }\n}\n\nYou know, from the game, that the game board has two types of squares. There are\nproperty squares (squares that represent a certain street or railroad) and there are\naction squares (such as \"Go directly to jail\" or \"Pick a Chance card\"). You decide to\nuse inheritance to help model these board elements.\n\nThe first thing you do is create an abstract class called Property. You make it\nabstract because you realize there are many types of \"property\" in the game (players\ncan own locations on the board, houses, and hotels). The Property class contains:\n\n- A private String called name, that holds the name of this Property.\n- A private int called cost, that holds the cost to buy this Property.\n- A private Player object called owner. Initially the owner data member is\nset equal to null.\n- Public get() methods for the three private data members, along with a\nsetOwner() method.\n- An abstract method called costToOpponent(), which returns a value\nthat is used to calculate how much an opponent would owe the owner if\nhe/she landed on this piece of Property.\n\n1.00/1.001 - Spring 2010 - Final Exam\n3 / 22\npublic abstract class Property {\n\nprivate String name;\n\nprivate int cost;\n\nprivate Player owner;\n\npublic Property(String name, int cost){\n\nthis.name = name;\n\nthis.cost = cost;\n\nthis.owner = null;\n\n}\n\npublic String getName() { return name; }\n\npublic int getCost() { return cost; }\n\npublic Player getOwner(){ return owner; }\n\npublic void setOwner(Player buyer){ this.owner = buyer; }\n\npublic abstract int costToOpponent();\n}\n\n1.a\nThe next thing you need to do is create an interface for board squares. The\ninterface is called BoardSquare. Every square on the board must have a\nposition on the board (represented as an int). For example, Park Place is\nlocated at position 37 on a game board. Write a BoardSquare interface that\nguarantees that an object that implements BoardSquare will have a method\nthat returns its location.\n\n1.00/1.001 - Spring 2010 - Final Exam\n4 / 22\n1.b\nYou now put these parts together to create a concrete class called\nPropertySquare. This class is used to represent all the locations on the board\nthat can be bought by Players. Write the PropertySquare class so that:\n\n-\nIt inherits from the abstract Property class.\n-\nIt implements the BoardSquare interface.\nThe value a Player must pay, if he/she lands on the square, is equal to half the cost\nof buying the Property. (e.g., If it costs 350 dollars to buy \"Park Place\" then a player\nmust pay 175 dollars to the person who owns \"Park Place\").\n\npublic class PropertySquare\n\n{\n\n}\n\n1.00/1.001 - Spring 2010 - Final Exam\n5 / 22\nAssume that you have created another concrete class called ActionSquare that also\ninherits from the BoardSquare interface. All squares on the board are either of type\nActionSquare or PropertySquare.\n\n1.c You should also assume there is a class called Board that has methods that help\nrun the game. In the Board class, you want to write a public method called\nisUnownedSquare(BoardSquare square). The method should:\n\n-\nTake in a BoardSquare object.\n-\nReturn a boolean value of true if the square is a PropertySquare\nand does not have an owner. Otherwise, return false.\n\npublic boolean isUnownedSquare(BoardSquare square)\n{\n\n}\n\n1.00/1.001 - Spring 2010 - Final Exam\n6 / 22\nQuestion 2: Exceptions\n\nYou are writing a program that analyzes some geometrical data. The data is\nstored as pairs of points and values in the following class.\n\npublic class PointValue{\n\nprivate double x;\n\nprivate double y;\n\nprivate double value;\n\npublic PointValue(double x, double y, double v) {\n\nthis.x = x;\n\nthis.y = y;\n\nvalue = v;\n\n}\n\npublic double getX() {return x;}\n\npublic double getY() {return y;}\n\npublic double getValue() {return value;}\n}\n\nThere is also a class Polygon, which stores a sequence of points. It has a\nmethod which determines whether a point is inside the polygon or not.\n\npublic class Polygon{\n\n// implementation hidden: constructor, data members, etc.\n\npublic boolean contains(PointValue p){\n\n// implementation hidden\n\n// returns true if p is inside the Polygon\n\n// returns false if it is not\n\n}\n}\n\nYou need to write a class that will store some PointValue objects, but only if\nthey are inside a specified Polygon. You decide to store the PointValues in\nan ArrayList. You will create a PolygonList class that will only store\nPointValues inside a specific Polygon, which is specified when the object\nis created. You should not extend the ArrayList class, but instead you\nshould have an ArrayList inside your class. If someone tries to add a PointValue\nto the list that is not inside the Polygon, the add method should throw a\nPointOutOfBoundsException, defined as follows:\n\n1.00/1.001 - Spring 2010 - Final Exam\n7 / 22\npublic class PointOutOfBoundsException extends Exception {\n\npublic PointOutOfBoundsException() {super();}\n\npublic PointOutOfBoundsException(String s) {super(s);}\n}\n\nWrite class PolygonList below:\n\npublic class PolygonList {\n\n// 2.a Put data members here\n\n// 2.b Write the constructor here\n\n// 2.c The add method checks if the PointValue is actually\n// inside the polygon.

Instead, our hashing is implemented by two hash functions. The\nmain hash function is (value / 100) .The secondary hash function is used when\ntwo values are hashed into the same slot using the main hash function (i.e., a\ncollision occurs). The second hash function is (value % 100) / 10. The following\nelements (all integers) are to be inserted into a hashtable of size 10.\n\n47, 90, 426, 140, 135\n\n3.c.1 Draw the table after the above elements are inserted.\n\n3.c.2 The HashTable class below has a find method to check if a particular integer\nvalue has been stored in the table.

Your\nmethod should not loop through the entire array holding the integers.\n\npublic class HashTable {\n\nprivate Integer[] table;\n\npublic HashTable(int capacity){\ntable= new Integer[capacity];\n}\n\npublic boolean find (int i){\n\n}\n}\n\n1.00/1.001 - Spring 2010 - Final Exam\n11 / 22\nQuestion 4 - Matrices and Recursion\n\nIn this question, you will implement a recursive method to compute the determinant of\nany square matrix, of any size.\n\n4.a\nYou first need to write a helper method, which will be used later by the method\nthat computes the determinant.\n\nThe kth submatrix Mk of a square matrix M is obtained by deleting the first row and the\nkth column from M, as shown in the example below:\n\ncolumn k\n\nrow 0\n\n-2\n\n-2\n\n-1\n-6\n\n-6\n\nMatrix M\n\nSubmatrix Mk\n\nThe dimension of a square matrix is its number of rows or its number of columns, which\nare equal. From a square matrix of dimension n, you can therefore extract n\nsubmatrices, each of dimension (n-1).\n\nYou are given a SquareMatrix class. It is similar to the Matrix class from lecture,\nbut can only be used to represent square matrices. For example, the SquareMatrix\nclass has a single getDimension() method, while the Matrix class had the pair of\nmethods getRows() and getCols().\n\nComplete the getSubMatrix(int k) method of the SquareMatrix class, which\nshould return the kth submatrix of the square matrix on which it is invoked. This first\nmethod does not have to be recursive, and you can assume that 0 ≤ k ≤ n.\n\n1.00/1.001 - Spring 2010 - Final Exam\n12 / 22\npublic class SquareMatrix {\n\nprivate double[][] data;\n\npublic SquareMatrix(int n){data = new double[n][n];}\n\npublic double getE(int i, int j){return data[i][j];}\n\npublic void setE(int i, int j, double value)\n{\ndata[i][j] = value;\n}\n\npublic int getDim(){return data.length;}\n\npublic SquareMatrix getSubMatrix(int k)\n\n{\n\n}\n// the getDeterminant()method (answer to next question)\n// goes here.\n}\n\n1.00/1.001 - Spring 2010 - Final Exam\n13 / 22\n4.b\nThe determinant |A| of a square matrix A of dimension n can be computed as:\n\nwhere:\n\n- a0k\nis the element of A located at row 0, column k.\n- |Ak|\nis the determinant of the submatrix Ak, which is extracted from A as\ndescribed above.\n\nFor example, the determinant of a 3-by-3 matrix is:\n\nWhile the matrix A is of dimension n, each submatrix Ak is of dimension (n-1).\nTherefore, the determinant of a large matrix can be computed a sum of determinants of\nsmaller matrices. When a matrix is small enough, its determinant can be computed\ndirectly. We know for example how to compute the determinant of a 2-by-2 matrix:\n\n= b00 b11 - b01 b10\n\nAnd the determinant of a 1-by-1 matrix is its only element:\n\n|c00| = c00\n\nComplete the getDeterminant() method of the SquareMatrix class, which should\nreturn the value of the determinant of the square matrix on which it is invoked. This\nmethod must be recursive. Remember that a recursive method should directly return\nthe result if the input is small enough to do so, but should call itself in order to solve for\na larger input.\nb00\nb01\nb10\nb11\na00\na01\na02\na10\na11\na12\na20\na21\na22\n\n= (-1)0 a00\na11\na12\n+ (-1)1 a01\na10\na12\n+ (-1)2 a02\na01 a11\na21\na22\na20\na22\na20 a21\n\n1.00/1.001 - Spring 2010 - Final Exam\n14 / 22\n// This method is in the SquareMatrix class\n\npublic double getDeterminant()\n// Must be recursive\n{\n\n}\n\n1.00/1.001 - Spring 2010 - Final Exam\n15 / 22\nQuestion 5 - Streams and Swing\n\nIt's time to get excited! This question combines two of your favorite subjects: streams\nand Swing. You will first be asked to write code that allows you to read and write files.\nYou will then be asked a question about the GUI that uses this code.\n\nImagine that you are building a small drawing program, where you use Line2D objects\nto draw shapes on a GUI (such as the house in the screenshot below).\n\nYou quickly realize that it is important to be able to save your drawing, and load\ndrawings into your program. You decide to store drawings as text files.\n\nLine2D objects will be stored as a single line separated by commas:\nExample: \"200,200,200,400\" defines a Line that starts at (200,200) and ends at\n(200,400).\n\nSo, the drawing of the house in the previous screenshot can be stored in a .txt file as:\n\n200,200,200,400\n400,200,400,400\n200,400,400,400\n175,200,425,200\n175,200,300,50\n425,200,300,50\n(c) Oracle.

You will be asked\nto fill in the loadDrawingFromFile() and saveDrawingToFile() methods.\n\npublic class StreamPanel extends JPanel{\n\n// Name of file where drawings are saved to and loaded from\n\nprivate final String fileName = \"examp_points.txt\";\n\n// List of all the Lines to be drawn on the StreamPanel\n\nArrayList<Line2D> lines = new ArrayList<Line2D>();\n\npublic StreamPanel(){\n\nthis.setPreferredSize(new Dimension(600, 600));\n\n}\n\npublic void paintComponent(Graphics g){\n\nsuper.paintComponents(g);\n\nGraphics2D g2 = (Graphics2D) g;\n\n//draw all the lines\n\nfor (Line2D l: lines) g2.draw(l);\n\n}\n\n// Loads in a drawing\n\npublic void loadDrawingFromFile(){// FILL IN FOR PART 5A }\n\n// Saves the current drawing\n\npublic void saveDrawingToFile(){// FILL IN FOR PART 5B }\n\n// Returns a Line2D object represented by String values\n\nprivate Line2D makeLine(String x1, String y1, String x2,\nString y2){\n\nDouble x1Val = Double.parseDouble(x1);\n\nDouble y1Val = Double.parseDouble(y1);\n\nDouble x2Val = Double.parseDouble(x2);\n\nDouble y2Val = Double.parseDouble(y2);\n\nreturn new Line2D.Double(x1Val, y1Val, x2Val, y2Val);\n\n}\n\n// Takes in a Line2D object and returns a String\n// representation of it\n\nprivate String lineToString(Line2D l){\n\nString lString = l.getX1()+\",\"+l.getY1()+\",\"+\nl.getX2()+\",\"+l.getY2()+\"\\n\";\n\nreturn lString;\n\n}}\n\n1.00/1.001 - Spring 2010 - Final Exam\n17 / 22\n5.a\nIn the space below, fill in the loadDrawingFromFile() method for the\nStreamPanel class.\n\n- Be sure to use a BufferedReader to read in the Line2D objects from the file\nrepresented by the fileName data member.\n- Store each Line2D object in the lines data member (Hint: you may find the\nmakeLine() method useful for creating Line2D objects).\n- Catch and print to the console the possible IOException thrown by opening a\nstream.\n- Remember this is a comma delimited file. Also, assume the file is formatted\nproperly and that all values in the file are valid doubles.\n\npublic void loadDrawingFromFile(){\n\n}\n\n1.00/1.001 - Spring 2010 - Final Exam\n18 / 22\n5.b\nIn the space provided below, fill in the saveDrawingToFile() method for the\nStreamPanel class. The method should save all the Line2D objects in the\nlines list to the file represented by the fileName data member. Also,\nremember to catch the possible IOException thrown by opening a stream.\n\nHint: you may find the lineToString() method useful for creating a String\nrepresentation of each line.\n\npublic void saveDrawingToFile(){\n\n}\n\n1.00/1.001 - Spring 2010 - Final Exam\n19 / 22\n5.c\nImagine that you have a GUI called DrawingFrame that consists of a JFrame\nwith only a StreamPanel added to it. You've also been given a file whose\ncontents look like this:\n\n50,100,50,200\n50,100,400,100\n50,200,400,200\n400,100,400,50\n400,200,400,250\n400,50,550,150\n400,250,550,150\n\nSketch what the resulting DrawingFrame GUI would look like if you ran the GUI and\nloaded this file into the StreamPanel. The GUI size is 600x600.\n\n1.00/1.001 - Spring 2010 - Final Exam\n20 / 22\nQuestion 6 - Data Structures\n\nWe have used stacks in class, but one thing you might not have known is that stacks\ncan actually be implemented by using linked lists. In this question, you will build a stack\nclass using linked lists.\n\nWe provide a simple implementation of a linked list and an interface for stack here. You\nwill use these in the implementation of your stack.\n\npublic class LinkedList {\n\n//Adds an Object o to the end of the Linked List\n\npublic void add(Object o)\n\n{\n/* Implementation hidden */\n}\n\n//Adds an Object o at index position to the Linked List\n\npublic void add(Object o, int index)\n\n{\n/* Implementation hidden */\n}\n\n//Returns the Object stored at the index position\n\npublic Object get(int index)\n\n{\n/* Implementation hidden */\n}\n\n//Removes the Object stored at the index position\n\npublic void remove(int index)\n\n{\n/* Implementation hidden */\n}\n\n//Returns the number of Objects in the Linked List\n\npublic int size()\n\n{\n/* Implementation hidden */\n}\n\n//Removes all the Objects from the Linked List\n\npublic void clear()\n\n{\n/* Implementation hidden */\n}\n}\n\n1.00/1.001 - Spring 2010 - Final Exam\n21 / 22\npublic interface Stack\n{\npublic boolean isEmpty();\npublic void push( Object o );\npublic Object pop();\npublic void clear();\n}\n\n6.a\nComplete the implementation of LLStack given below.

Here is a screen-shot of what the panel would like if\nyour TA was trying to draw a pumpkin for Halloween:\n\nPart A:\n\nThe panel that draws these symmetric images is an extension of JPanel, and is called\nMirrorPanel. MirrorPanel has:\n- A private ArrayList<Point2D>, called paintPoints that contains all the\npoints created by dragging the mouse. paintPoints does NOT contain any of\nthe symmetric points.\n- A public method addPoint(Point2D pt) that adds a new point to the\npaintPoints ArrayList.\n- A public method clearPainting() that clears the paintPoints ArrayList.\n\nLook over the provided code. Two parts are missing in the paintComponent()\nmethod. You will be asked to fill them in the following question.\n(c) Oracle. All rights reserved.

Create a Line2D\nobject that starts at the panel's top midpoint and ends at the bottom midpoint (like the\nline shown in the screenshot). We have provided a variable called panelHalfWidth\nthat represents the midpoint (on the x-axis) for the panel. Use the g2.draw() function\nto draw the line.\n\nPart 1 code goes here:\n\nNow draw the paintPoints and the points that correspond to their reflection around\nthe middle dividing line. We've provided code that iterates through the list of points.\nYou should represent each point as a small circle. This can be done by filling in a small\nEllipse2D object with a height and width of 4 pixels for each point. Each Ellipse2D\nobject should be centered on the corresponding pt. You'll need to calculate the x-\ncoordinate for the reflected point. To test your math: if the panel width is 800, and a\npoint's x value = 150 then the mirror x value = 650.\n\nPart 2 code goes here:\n\n1.00/1.001 - Spring 2010 - Quiz 2\n6 / 11\nPart B:\n\nNow we are going to build a small JFrame class that uses the panel. The class is\ncalled TestClass and it extends JFrame. It contains:\n- A MirrorPanel called mirror.\n- A JButton called clearButton that is responsible for clearing the\nmirrorPanel's current paintPoints.\nRead over the provided code. You will be asked to add the mirror and clearButton\nobjects to the TestClass's ContentPane to make the application look like the screen\nshot above. You will also be asked to add an ActionListener for the clearButton\nobject.\n\npublic class TestClass extends JFrame{\n\nMirrorPanel mirror = new MirrorPanel();\n\nJButton clearButton = new JButton(\"Clear\");\n\npublic TestClass(){\n\nsuper(\"Mirror App\");\n\n//************************************************************\n//\n// PART 1: add the mirror and clearButton objects\n//\n//************************************************************\n\n//MouseMotionListener is a type of Listener that captures mouse drag\n//events on the mirror panel, and adds each mouse position point to the\n//mirror's list of draw points.\n\nmirror.addMouseMotionListener(new MouseAdapter() {\n\npublic void mouseDragged(MouseEvent e) {\n\nPoint2D mouseDragPoint = new\nPoint2D.Double(e.getX(), e.getY());\n\nmirror.addPoint(mouseDragPoint);\n\nrepaint();\n\n}\n\n});\n\n//************************************************************\n//\n// PART 2: add an ActionListener for clearButton\n//\n//************************************************************\n\n}\n\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n\nTestClass frame = new TestClass();\n\nframe.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);\n\nframe.pack();\n\nframe.setVisible(true);\n\n}\n}\n\n1.00/1.001 - Spring 2010 - Quiz 2\n7 / 11\nWrite code so that the mirror and clearButton objects are added to the\nContentPane of the TestClass. You should write code so that the resulting layout\nwould resemble the layout of the screenshot at the beginning of this problem.\n\nPart 1 code goes here:\n\nUsing an anonymous inner class, add an ActionListener to the clearButton, so\nthat the mirror's paintPoints are erased and the frame is redrawn every time the\nbutton is clicked.\n\nPart 2 code goes here:\n\n1.00/1.001 - Spring 2010 - Quiz 2\n8 / 11\nQuestion 3 - Inheritance and Interfaces (35 points)\n\nA physical analysis program written in Java has a library of materials available to the\nengineer to model physical entities. The materials are organized in a hierarchy of\nclasses. Each material is eventually represented by an object holding the material\nproperties, such as the density, electrical conductivity and elasticity. You do not need to\nworry about the units when using the material properties in this problem.\n\nAll material classes are derived from the Material superclass.\n\npublic abstract class Material\n{\n\nprivate String name;\n\npublic Material(String name){this.name = name;}\n\npublic String getName() {return name;};\n\npublic abstract double getDensity();\n}\n\nInterfaces are used to describe specific material properties.

This is called auto-boxing.\n- Wrapper classes allow objects (e.g., Boolean or Double)\nthat hold basic types (e.g. boolean or double)\n- Think airplane vs bicycle as two ways to get from A to B\n- Bicycle is simple, airplane is complex, though both get you there\n- Squeeze hand brake doesnt apply to plane, adjust flaps to bicycle\n- So it is with arrays and ArrayLists: similar but quite different\n\nArrayLists\n- ArrayList class is not in the core Java language\n- It is in package java.util, which you must import:\nimport java.util.*; // At top of program\n- ArrayLists are slightly slower than arrays\n- This matters only in large numerical applications\n- ArrayList class has many methods that provide\nfunctionality beyond what arrays provide\n- You can declare an ArrayList as containing\nobjects of a particular type. Example:\nArrayList<Point> pList = new\n\nArrayList<Point>( );\nSome Methods of ArrayList\nboolean add (Object o)\nAdds object to end, increases size\nby one. Always returns true\nvoid add(int i, Object o) Inserts o at index i moving\nsubsequent elements to right\nObject get(int i)\nReturns object at index i\nint indexOf(Object o)\nFinds first occurrence of object;\n-1 if not found\nboolean isEmpty( )\nReturns true if ArrayList has no\nobjects, false otherwise\nvoid remove (int i)\nDeletes obj at index i moving\nsubsequent elements leftward\nvoid remove (Object o)\nDeletes first occurrence of o\nmoving subsequent elements\nleftward\nvoid set(int i,Object o) Sets element at index i to be the\nspecified object\nint size( )\nReturns size of ArrayList\n\nArrayList Example\nimport java.awt.*;\n// to use Point class\nimport java.util.*;\n// to use ArrayList class\n\npublic class ArrayListTest {\nstatic final int M = 100; // Max coordinate\n\npublic static void main(String args[]) {\nRandom r= new Random();\nint numPoints = r.nextInt(20);\n// Max 20 points\nArrayList<Point> points = new ArrayList<Point> ( );\n\nfor (int i=0; i< numPoints; i++) {\nPoint p = new Point( r.nextInt(M), r.nextInt(M));\npoints.add(p);\n}\n\nSystem.out.println(\"ArrayList size: + points.size());\nfor (Point pt : points)\nSystem.out.println(pt);\n}\n}\nAutomatic conversion of\nprimitives to objects\n- Java has boxing and unboxing:\n- When necessary, the compiler converts a primitive (e.g.,\nint or double) to the corresponding object type (e.g.,\nInteger or Double)\n- This lets us add primitive types to an ArrayList:\nArrayList<Integer> myAList = new\n\nArrayList<Integer>( );\nmyAList.add(1); // 1 is an int; its boxed\nmyAList.add(3); // same as myAList.add(new\n\n// Integer(3));\nmyAList.add(7);\n// retrieves Integer, unboxes to int\nint iValue = myAlist.get(1);\n\nTest Your Knowledge\nhich of the following statements is NOT true about\n1. W\nArrayLists?\na. ArrayLists are slightly faster than arrays.\nb. ArrayLists can store elements of different types.\nc. ArrayLists can increase in size to store more elements.\nd. ArrayLists have methods to manage their content.\n\nTest Your Knowledge\n2. Given the following code fragment:\nArrayList<String> myArrayList = new\nArrayList<String>( );\nmyArrayList.add(\"One\");\nmyArrayList.add(\"Two\");\nmyArrayList.add(\"Three\");\nmyArrayList.add(\"Four\");\n\nWhich of the following expressions will modify myArrayList so it\nlooks like:\n\na. myArrayList.remove (myArrayList.get(3));\nb. myArrayList.remove (myArrayList.indexOf(\"Three\"));\nc. myArrayList.remove (Three);\nd. myArrayList.remove (myArrayList.get(2));\n\nTest Your Knowledge\n3.

// Dot operator\n- Methods are usually public and can be invoked anywhere\n\n- Data fields are also invoked with the dot (.) operator\n- No parentheses after field name\n\ndouble r= tank0.radius;\n\ndouble t= tank0.thickness;\n- Private data fields cant be accessed outside their class\n- The data fields in our Tank example cannot be accessed this\nway in TankTest because theyre all private to Tank\n- If they were public in Tank, they could be seen from TankTest\n- Private fields can be accessed this way within class Tank\n\nGet() and Set() Methods\n- Weve seen get() methods\n- They ask an object to compute or return a fact\nabout itself\npublic double getVolume() {\nreturn Math.PI*radius*radius*length;\n}\npublic double getRadius() {return radius;}\n- Set() methods tell an object to change one\nif its data members\npublic void setRadius(double r) {\n\nradius= r;\n}\nGet() and Set() Methods 2\n- Weve seen get() methods\n- They ask an object to compute or return a fact\nabout itself\npublic double getVolume() {\nreturn Math.PI*radius*radius*length;\n}\npublic double getRadius() {return radius;}\n- Set() methods tell an object to change one\nif its data members\npublic void setRadius(double radius) {\n\nthis.radius= radius;\n} // this is keyword for current object\n\nObjects and Names\nnew Tank(0.5, 4.0, 0.04);\n\nTank\n0.5 4.0 0.04\nObjects and Names\nTank t0= new Tank(0.5, 4.0, 0.04);\n\nt0=\nTank\n0.5 4.0 0.04\n\nt0=\nTank\n0.5 4.0 0.04\np=\nPipe\n0.1 10.0\nObjects and Names\nTank t0= new Tank(0.5, 4.0, 0.04);\nPipe p= new Pipe(0.1, 10.0);\n// radius, length\nt0=\nTank\n0.5 4.0 0.04\np=\nPipe\nt1=\nTank\n1.0 1.0 0.04\n0.1 10.0\nObjects and Names\nTank t0= new Tank(0.5, 4.0, 0.04);\nPipe p= new Pipe(0.1, 10.0);\n// radius, length\nTank t1= new Tank(1.0, 1.0, 0.04);\n\nt0=\nTank\n0.5 4.0 0.04\np=\nPipe\nt1=\nTank\n1.0 1.0 0.04\n0.1 10.0\nt2=\nObjects and Names\nTank t0= new Tank(0.5, 4.0, 0.04);\nPipe p= new Pipe(0.1, 10.0);\n// radius, length\nTank t1= new Tank(1.0, 1.0, 0.04);\nTank t2;\n\nt0=\nTank\n0.5 4.0 0.04\np=\nPipe\nt1=\nTank\n1.0 1.0 0.04\n0.1 10.0\nt2=\nObjects and Names\n0= new Tank(0.5, 4.0, 0.04);\nTank t\nPipe p= new Pipe(0.1, 10.0);\n// radius, length\nTank t1= new Tank(1.0, 1.0, 0.04);\nTank t2;\nt2= t1;\n\nt0=\nTank\n0.5 4.0 0.04\n\np=\nPipe\nt1=\nTank\n1.0 1.1 0.04\n0.1 10.0\nt2=\n1.0\nObjects and Names\nnk t0= new Tank(0.5, 4.0, 0.04);\nTa\nPipe p= new Pipe(0.1, 10.0);\n// radius, length\nTank t1= new Tank(1.0, 1.0, 0.04);\nTank t2;\nt2= t1;\nt2.setRadius(1.1);

For example:\npublic class Tank {\nprivate double radius;\nprivate double height;\npublic Tank() { height= 1.0; radius= 2.0;}\npublic Tank(double h) { height= h; radius= 2.0}\npublic Tank(double h, double r) {\n\nheight= h; radius= r; }\n...\nn\n\n}\n\nBuilding Classes\n- A window company has 3 plants\n- Parts plant A makes wood frames\n- Unit cost $25/frame\n- Parts plant B makes glass\n- Unit cost $5/pane\n- Assembly plant C, adjacent to plant B, assembles\nwindows\n- Unit assembly cost $12\n- How many classes? How many objects?\n- Well write the classes for this problem\n- There are many alternatives; we guide you to use a\nstraightforward one\n- This will not be a general solution. It will work only for one\nproduct, taking one frame and one pane of glass. It may\nseem too restrictive, but its a typical starting point.\n- Use the spiral model to make your solution more\ngeneral in a second or third pass.\nPartsPlant Class\n- Write the class PartsPlant for plants producing\none item: frames or glass. Ignore window assembl\nfor now. This is a recipe for making a plant\npublic class PartsPlant {\n// Data fields:\n_________________\n_________________\n// Constructor:\n_________________\n_________________\n_________________\n_________________\n\n// This is all outside the main() method. PartsPlant doesnt\n// have and doesnt need main(). Delete it if you have one.\ny\n\nPartsPlant Class Method\n- Dont write any set methods. The parts pl\ndata is set by the constructor and we wont\nchange it after that in this problem.\n// Get methods, for each private field:\n_________________\n_________________\n_________________\n_________________\n\ns\nant\n\nAssemblyPlant Class\n- We assemble one product from parts produced by\ntwo Plants. Write class AssemblyPlant:\nEclipse: New->Class: AssemblyPlant\n- This is a recipe for making an AssemblyPlant\npublic class AssemblyPlant {\n// Data fields: what is made, what parts plants are used, cost\n_________________\n_________________\n_________________\n_________________\n// Constructor\n_________________\n_________________\n_________________\n\nAssemblyPlant Class Methods\nDont write any set or get methods other than\nthe ones below.\n// Computational method (cost)\n_________________\n_________________\n_________________\n_________________\n_________________\n_________________\n_________________\n_________________\n// Get method to return name of product being\nassembled\n_________________\n_________________\n-\nmain()\nss, write a main() method to:\nparts plants. This uses their recipes to make\n- In a new cla\n- Create two\nobjects\n- Create assembly plant. This uses its recipe to make an objec\n- Find the cost of windows. Ask the AssemblyPlant object\n- Output window cost. Use System.out.println()\n- Output the name of the assembled product and its\ncomponents. Ask the objects; then use System.out.println()\npublic class GlassTest {\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n_________________\n_________________\n_________________\n_________________\n_________________\n_________________\n}\nt\n}\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n1.00 / 1.001 / 1.002 Introduction to Computers and Engineering Problem Solving\nSpring 2012\n\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

Notice how there is only ONE object, and each reference\n\"refers\" to it.\nTo create an instance of Node:\nNode n = new Node();\nNode n2 = n;\n\nFun with References\nLet's add to our Node class\nNode.java\nNow, let's use the following code:\nNode n1 = new Node();\nNode n2 = new Node();\nn2.next = n1;\nn1.next = n2;\nclass Node{\n\nNode next;\n}\nNode.java\nnext\nn1\nnext\nn2\n\nSerious Work with References\nLet's add a data member to store some information.\n(It could be a primitive type or an object reference...\nor anything else you want)\nNode.java\nNow, let's use the following code:\nNode first =\nfirst.value=1;\nfirst.next =\nfirst.next.value=2;\nfirst.next.next =\nfirst.next.next.value = 3;\nclass Node{\n\nNode next;\n\nint value;\n}\nNode.java\nfirst\nnext\nvalue\nnext\nvalue\nnext\nvalue\n\nIt's a Linked List!\n\nnew Node();\nnew Node();\nnew Node();\n\nLinked Lists\n- A linked list is made of a series of Nodes, each\nwith:\n- an associated item object\n- a reference to the next node of the list\n- Simplified \"double-box\" picture:\n\n- Traverse the list by following each node's \"next\"\nreference\nB\nnext\nitem\nC\nnext\nitem\nA\nnext\nitem\n\nSLinkedList\nFor convenience, create a class with references to the\nfirst & last nodes, with methods, so we don't have to re-\nwrite the manipulation code each time.\npublic class SLinkedList implements List{\n\nprivate int length = 0;\nprivate Node first = null;\nprivate Node last = null;\n\nprivate static class Node {\n\nObject item;\nNode next;\nNode( Object o, Node n ){ item = o; next = n; }\n}\n\npublic int size() {/*code...*/}\npublic boolean isEmpty() {/*code...*/}\npublic boolean contains(Object o) {/*code...*/}\npublic void clear() {/*code...*/}\n// various add() and remove() methods...\n}\nOur original\nNode class\n\nWhat's so great about\nLinked Lists?\nBIG Pros:\n- A Linked List can grow dynamically.\n(To resize an array you have to create a new, larger array, and copy everything over)\n- A linked list does NOT need contiguous memory.\n(A Java 1-D array has to occupy contiguous memory. When storing large amounts of data,\nfinding back-to-back-to-back... memory can be impossible)\n\nCons:\n- The references add overhead.\n- Access is slower than an array.\n- The code to maintain a Linked List can be complex.\n- Depending on how the 'links' (references) are structured, you\nmay only be able to traverse one way...\n\n- Always think of special cases\n- What if your list is empty?\n- What if there is only one element?\n\n- Always draw a diagram!\nLinked List: Tips\nnext\nnext\nnext\nfirst\nlast\n\nSorting\n- Sortable objects implement\nComparable<Object> or have Comparator\ndefined\n- Comparable:\n- Define compareTo()\n- For object.compareTo(other):\n- returns 1 if other higher ranked than object\n- returns 0 if equally ranked\n- returns -1 otherwise\n\nSorting\n- Comparator:\n- New class Object1Object2Comparator\n- Implements Comparator<Object>\n- Must define compare(). For\ncompare(a, b):\n- returns 1 if b higher ranked than a\n- return 0 if equally ranked\n- returns -1 otherwise\n\nSorting Exercise\n- Sort restaurants by rating (high to low) then\ndistance (close to far)\npublic class Restaurant {\n\nString name;\n\nint rating;\n\ndouble distance;\n\npublic Restaurant(String n, int r, double d){\n\nname = n;\n\nrating = r;\n\ndistance = d;\n\n}\n\npublic String toString(){\n\nreturn name + \": \" + rating + \"/5.0, \" + distance + \" meters away.\";\n\n}\n}\n\nStacks and Queues\n- Structures store, manage data\n- For data with an inherent order\n- Think of structures like a line to get into a movie\n- Stacks: people are added and removed from\nsame end of line\n- Last person in an elevator is the first person out of the\nelevator\n- FIFO Queue: people added to back of line,\nremoved from front\n- First In First Out, the way you expect a ticket line to\nwork\n\nStacks\n- Single end\n- LIFO: Last In First Out\n- push(): add an element\n- pop(): remove top\nelement\n- Applications:\n- Simulation: robots,\nmachines\n- Recursion: pending\nfunction calls\n- Reversal of data\n\nStack Interface\nimport java.util.*;\n// For exception\n\npublic interface Stack\n{\npublic boolean isEmpty();\npublic void push( Object o );\npublic Object pop() throws\n\nEmptyStackException;\npublic void clear();\n}\n\nQueues\n- Two ends\n- FIFO: First In First Out\n- push(): add an element\nto top\n- pop(): remove bottom\nelement\n- Applications:\n- Simulation: lines\n- Ordered requests:\ndevice drivers, routers, ...\n- Searches\n\nQueue Interface\nimport java.util.*;\n\npublic interface Queue\n{\npublic boolean isEmpty();\npublic void add( Object o );\npublic Object remove() throws\n\nNoSuchElementException;\npublic void clear();\n}\n\nExercise\n- What is the final output?\n- Add {2, 4, 6, 8} to a stack #1\n- Remove three items from stack, place in queue\n- Remove two items from queue, place in stack #2\n- Remove one item from stack #2, place in queue\n- Remove one item from stack #1, place in stack #2\nQueue:\n{6, 4}\nStack #2:\n{2, 8}\n\nExercise\n- Write a class to store a queue in a linked list\n- What happens when you remove the last object?\n- What happens when you try to remove an object\nfrom an empty list?\n\npublic interface Queue {\n\npublic void enqueue(int item);\n// add to end\npublic int dequeue() throws Exception; // remove from front\n}\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n1.00 / 1.001 / 1.002 Introduction to Computers and Engineering Problem Solving\nSpring 2012\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

Usually one\nof two scenarios:\n- The method takes in all the information it needs as\narguments:\nMath.pow(double base, double exp)\n- Or, the method needs access to only static variables.\n- Usually you can think of these methods as taking in some\ninformation and performing a service for you\n- Typically, they do not alter the state of the class, as they do\nnot have access to instance variables\n\nExercise 1: Static Members\n- Write a class Ticket that\n- Keeps track of how many tickets there are\n- Assigns a unique ticket number to each ticket, starting with\n100, 101, etc.\n- Has a method to return the number of tickets\n- Has a method to return the ticket number\n- Write a class TicketTest that creates some\nTicket objects and then prints out how many\nwere created.\n\nKeywords Summary\npublic / private\nControl access to data members and methods. Public data members can be\naccessed outside the class, and public methods can be invoked outside the class.\nPrivate data members and methods are not visible outside the class\n\nstatic\nEach instance (object) of a class has its own copy of each non-static data member,\nbut there is only one copy of each static data members, shared by all instances\n(objects) of the class.\nA static method can only use the static data members of the class and its input\nparameters. Static methods are invoked on the class name, not on any object\nname.\n\nvoid\nApart from constructors, every method has a declared return type. If a method does\nnot return anything, its return type must be void.\n\nfinal\nThe value of a final data member cannot be modified after it has been initialized.\n\nKeywords Summary\npublic class UGrad{\n\nprivate double gpa;\npublic static final int MAX_GPA = 5;\n\npublic double getGPA() {\nreturn gpa;\n}\n\npublic void printGPA() {\nSystem.out.println(\"GPA: \" + gpa + \" / \" + MAX_GPA);\n}\n\npublic static int getMaxGpa() {\nreturn MAX_GPA;\n}\n}\nWhat is the function of each keyword in this class?\n\nArray vs. ArrayList\n- Size fixed at creation\n- Accessed with z[]\n- Object with no methods\n- One public data\nmember: z.length\n- Slightly faster\n- Size varies as data is\nadded/removed\n- Accessed with\nz.get()\n- Object with no data\nmembers\n- Has lots of methods:\ne.g., z.add(),\nz.size()\n- More flexible\n\nArray and ArrayList\n- Setting and accessing data is different:\n\nint[] array = new int[3];\nfor(int i = 0; i < array.length ; i++) {\n\narray[i] = i;\n}\n\nWhat does array contain?\n\nArrayList<Integer> arrayList = new ArrayList<Integer>();\nfor(int i = array.length-1; i > -1 ; i--) {\n\narrayList.add(array[i]);\n}\n\nWhat does arrayList contain?\n\nArray or ArrayList?\n- Which would you use for the following\nproblems: an Array or ArrayList?\n- Write a method that returns all the primes\nbetween 2 and a specified number\n- Write a method that returns a specified number of\nrandom numbers\n\nArrayList Exercise\n- Write a method findPrimes(int n) that\nreturns an ArrayList<Integer> of all the\nprimes between 2 and n\n\n- Start by putting in all the numbers, then remove the\nones that are multiples of each other in the ArrayList\n\n- Some code is provided\n\nArrayList Exercise\npublic static ArrayList<Integer> findPrimes(int n) {\n//Declare the ArrayList\nfor (int i=2; i<=n; i++)\n//Put i in the ArrayList\nint i = 0;\nwhile //condition to make sure i is a valid index\nint j = i + 1;\nwhile //condition to make sure j is a valid index\nif //(element j)%(element i)==0\n//remove the proper number from the list\nelse\nj++;\n}\ni++;\n}\n//return your ArrayList\n}\n\nArray Exercise\n- Write a method makeRandom(int n) that\nreturns an array of n random numbers\n\n- Some code is provided\n\nArray Exercise\nprivate static Random r = new Random();\npublic static int[] makeRandom(int n) {\n//Create your array, then assign random\n//numbers using r.nextInt();\n}\n\nSelf assessment, lectures 1-11\nSkill\nBelow\nExpected\nAbove\nData types\nTypes misused.\nStatic not used\nInts and reals used\ndistinguishably.\nStatic used\ncorrectly\nInt, long, double,\nboolean, and static\nused purposefully\nVariables\nNumbers and\nvariables used\nwithout distinction\nVariables used for\nmost quantities\nVariables easy to\nread.
