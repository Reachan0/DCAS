Please hand in 4/2/03 in class:\n(a) A tentative title (indicating whether you will do a Critical Review or a Short\nProposal); (b) a tentative list of references that will form the basis for your review or\nproposal; (c) a short abstract summarizing your topic and how you will approach it.\nYou will, of course, still have the flexibility to modify or add to your choice. This\nassignment is to help you get started and to stimulate discussion of the suitability of a\ngiven topic.\nPlease consider all aspects of the course in making your selection, even those that might\nbe taught later on in the term.\nTERM PAPER DUE: May 9, 2003\nFORMAT: Two alternatives - choose one (MAXIMUM length = 7 pp):\n1. Write a SHORT PROPOSAL-NIH Style on any biomechanical subject, using the\nguidelines that follow (you might find some of the papers from the reading list useful).\n2. Write a CRITICAL REVIEW that involves reading at least 5 papers, discussing the\nproblems, methods, and conclusions in any area on which biomechanics may impinge.\n(We will hand out a reading list with some suggestions and examples of papers that you\nmight find useful and interesting, but you are welcome to search for any others as well).\nThe goal is to try and get an up-to-date review of the subjects as it currently stands and\nemphasize the outstanding questions that need to be addressed in the field. Maximum\nlength, excluding title page and reference list: 7 pages.\nHints For Writing Short Proposals:\nThe format for the proposal should be as follows. Include a cover page with your name\nand the title of your proposal. This page will not distributed to the \"reviewers.\" The\nmain body of the proposal will begin on the next page. The page limit for the main body\nof the proposal (excluding the title page and references, but including everything else) is\n\n7 pages. Please number the pages of your proposal but do not put your name on any page\nexcept the cover page. The body of the proposal should be organized into the following\nsections:\nA. Summary Page: Roughly 150 words. Describe briefly what question you propose to\nstudy, why it is important, and what you plan to do. Include the title again at the top of\nthis page.\nB. Background and Significance: This section gives the reader an introduction to the\nproblem that you propose to study. It should briefly summarize the key ideas in the field\nand build up to the specific questions that you will pose. Make sure you choose an\ninteresting problem - grants in the real world are penalized harshly if they simply attempt\nto cross the T's and dot the I's of previous work. Suggested length: ~ 1-2 pages.\nC. Specific Aims: List the two or three specific questions or hypotheses that you will\ntest. State the aims in as direct and simple a manner as possible. This section should be\nextremely short (one to two sentences for each aim).\nD. Methods: This is the meat of the proposal in which you describe exactly what you\npropose to do, how you would do it, what results you might obtain, how you would\ninterpret those results, and what pitfalls or problems might present difficulties in your\napproach. Here are some other (potentially relevant) issues that you might discuss: Are\nthere any technical difficulties that might make your approach impractical? Do you have\na backup plan if things go wrong? Are there alternative interpretations? If so, is there a\nfollow-up study that could disambiguate the interpretation?\nYou can organize this section any way you like, However, you should certainly\nlay it out according to your specific aims. Have one subsection on the first specific aim.\nand so on. In each of these subsections, be specific enough so that we will understand\nwhat you are planning to do.\nReferences: List references that document your point in all the previous sections.\nThere is no need to provide a summary or conclusion at the end of your proposal.\nYou may, however, want to include a brief section called \"Future Directions\" in which\nyou explain where this work might lead in the future, and what further issues could be\naddressed once you know the answers to the questions at hand.\nRemember a good grant communicates to the reviewers clearly and simply what\nyou are planning to do and why it is important. Assume that the reviewers are looking\nfor excuses to reject your proposal.\nReviewers in the real world get annoyed: (1) if they cannot understand you; (2) if\nyou pretend that something will be easy when it may actually be difficult; (3) if you try to\nclaim that some result(s) will be conclusive when there are other possible interpretations.\nEither of the instructors would be happy to provide a list of references if you need\nhelp in choosing a topic and getting started."

Each link has a two state variable σ which\nequals +1 if the link points forward and -1 if it points backward. The total chain\nN\nextension is then z = b∑ i .\ni =1\na) What is the probability P(σ1, σ2,...σN) of a given conformation (set of {σ1, σ2,...σN})\nwhen a constant force f is applied at the chain ends ?\nb) Prove that <z>/Nb = tanh(fb/kT).

Furthermore,\npolymerization is more rapid when the actin monomers have ATP bound.

We also considered rate\nprocesses for the dynamics and said that for the diffusion limited model the velocity of an\ndn\n2D\nend of the filament ( v =\n) was equal to\nin the limit that there is no external\ndt\nforce. We then said that drag force on the particle is v so the filament must be exerting\n2kT\na force of\n. Why is this value different than Feq ?

If the material were incompressible and has a Young's modulus of 106\nPa, how much force would need to be applied?\nb) Next, a shearing force is applied as in Fig. 1b. What is the shear modulus of the\nspecimen, based on your measurements in (a) and the stated assumptions? How great a\nshear force would need to be applied to displace the top surface a distance of 0.1h?\nc) If, in the process of conducting the experiment in (a), it is observed that the lateral\ndimensions of the specimen increase from h to 1.02h, what is the final volume of the\nspecimen? Is the specimen incompressible?

Making the thin-wall\napproximation so that the circumferential stress can be assumed uniform, what is the\nradial dependence of the radial compressive stress?\nNow consider a small cubic element located at a position halfway through the wall where\nwe consider the circumferential (\"1\"), radial (\"2\"), and axial (\"3\") coordinates as shown\nin the sketch and revert to planar coordinates (for algebraic simplicity).

What is the\nbulk compressive modulus? Recognizing that the tissue is comprised primarily of water\nand other essentially incompressible constituents, describe how such a volume change\nmight take place.\nd) What condition must be satisfied between the three strains (e11, e22, e33) for an\nincompressible material (n = 0.5)? Show that this leads to a bulk modulus (K = l+2G/3)\nthat is infinite. If the cube of material depicted in the figure above is initially h on each\nside, and is 1.1h x 0.8h x 0.8h following deformation, what is n? Does this make\nphysical sense?

For\nthe experiments described below, this tissue is well described in equilibrium by a linear,\nhomogenouos, isotropic (\"Hookean\") constitutive law for the porous network.\na) This tissue section is held between two glass slides to view the matrix and cells during\ndeformation (Fig. 1). the specimen is subjected to an applied stress t11, which produces a\nsmall compressive strain e11 in the x1-direction. The rigid, fluid impermeable glass slides\nprevent any elongation in the x2-direction, but there are no constraints in the x3-direction\n(i.e., unconfined in the x3-direction).\nFig. 1\nx2\nx3\nglass\nx1\nt11\nUse the conditions in the x2 and x3 directions in the equilibrium compressed state to find\nan expression for the apparent equilibrium modulus Ea in the x1-direction (defined by\nEa=t11/e11) in terms of the tissue's equilibrium Young's modulus E and the Poisson\nration n.\nb) The charge-titration behavior of the tissue is graphed in Fig. 2. (The net charge is due\nto ionization of sulfate, carboxyl, and amino acid groups on the various matrix\nmacromolecules, which varies with pH).\nNet\ncharge\npH\nFig. 2\nThe known magnitude of the modulus Ea in equilibrium at physiological pH ~ 7 is\nknown.

Why or why not?\n\nProblem 2 3-Element Model for Viscoelastic Materials\n(a) In class, we stated that the 3-element model for the standard linear viscoelastic solid\n(Fig. 1a) could be described by an ordinary differential equation of the form:\ndF = k1u + β du\nF + α dt\ndt\nShow that this form is correct, and find the constant α and β in terms of the element\nvalues k1, k2, and η.\n(b) The differential equation given above is useful for describing creep and stress\nrelaxation of some viscoelastic materials. For the case of cyclic (sinusoidal) loading it is\nmore convenient to describe the frequency dependence of the material stress-strain\nbehavior using a \"complex modulus\". In class, we showed that the complex modulus has\nthe form:\nGˆ = G′ + iG′ ′\nwhere Gˆ = (k1 + iωβ)/(1 + iωα). Find the real (G') and imaginary (G\") parts of the\ncomplex modulus in terms of α, β and the radian frequency ω.\n(c) Show that G'(ω) and G\"(ω) have the frequency dependence shown qualitatively in\nFig. 1b by reasoning the low and high frequency limits.

What is the equivalent \"diffusivity\"?\n(c) A step in displacement is applied at x1 = 0 having amplitude u0. State the boundary\nconditions on u1(x1=0,t) and u1(x1=L,t) and the initial condition u1(x1,t=0) that would be\nused to solve for the displacement u1(x1,t) occurring during this \"stress relaxation\".

State the boundary conditions on\nthe displacement (or its slope) and the initial condition on u1(x1,t=0) that would be used\nto solve for the creep displacement u1(x1,t).

What is the expression for the slowest (\"n=1\") decay time; i.e.,\nthe stress relaxation time, in terms of material and geometric constants?\ns\nx1 = 0\nx1 = L\nx1\n\nProblem 2 Perrmeability measurements\nThis problem emphasizes a general issue concerning the measurement of hydraulic\npermeability of hydrated soft tissues and other poroelastic media: applied pressure\ngradients and the resulting fluid flow can cause consolidation or deformation of the\ntissue. This might give rise to a nonlinear permeability that may ultimately be important\nto include in a model.\np = P0\nD\nTissue\np = 0\nU = U0\nz = -d\nz = 0\nA cylindrical disk of porous, hydrated tissue has thickness d and diameter D, and is held\nwithin a chamber that confines the disk at its radial periphery. the tissue is supported by\na rigid, porous filter located at the position z = 0. A constant pressure drop P0 is applied\nacross the tissue from left to right, resulting in a constant fluid flow velocity U0 with\nrespect to the tissue (the rigid filter prevents the tissue from moving, but does not\nimpeded fluid flow).\nThe applied pressure drop and resulting fluid flow cause a compresssion of the tissue\nagainst the rigid filter. You are to find the resulting steady state, z-dependent strain and\ndisplacement profiles using the 1-dimensional poroelastic model for tissue derived in\nclass.\n(a) As done in class, write expressions for (1) conservation of momentum, (2) Darcy's\nlaw, and (3) total stress versus strain (including hydrostatic pressure) in terms of the total\nstress szz, strain ezz, displacement uz, and pressure p.\nThe fourth equation, mass conservation, is given here as:\n-∂uz\nU =\n+ U0\n∂t\nwhere the term U0 corresponds to the possibility of a constant flow of fluid even when\n∂u /∂t = 0, as is the case here.\nz\n\n(b) Combine your equations (1)-(3) with the above equation to find the differential\nequation for uz in terms of the constant velocity U0, the hydraulic permeability k, and the\nconfined compression modulus H = (2G + l).\n(c) For the case of steady flow (∂/∂t = 0 ), integrate your differential equation to find an\nexpression for the displacement uz in terms of two integration constants. Find the two\nconstants from the boundary conditions:\n(i) zero displacement at z = 0\n(ii) zero strain (∂u /∂z ) at z = -d\nz\n(d) Write your final expressions for uz(z) and ezz(z) within the tissue.

If anyone raises questions that\nwe feel would be of general interest, we will post the question and our response\non the class website, so be sure to check periodically.\n- You are free to use any resource materials you feel might be useful.\nThere are three problems on the exam with the points as indicated.\nPlease be sure to explain your reasoning as fully as possible.\nWrite everything in the exam booklet, not on the exam or on separate pages.\nSolutions will be available at the time you turn in the exam.\n\nProblem #1 MEMBRANE MECHANICS (35 Points)\nThe lipid membrane of a large vesicle in solution will fluctuate due to thermal motion. It\nis possible that such fluctuations could result in a \"pinching off' of the membrane to form\ntwo smaller vesicles as shown in the figure below.\na) (10 pts) What is the change in the total bending energy in going from a system\ncontaining one large vesicle (radius = 30 mm) to a system containing a slightly smaller\nvesicle and a very small vesicle (radius = 1 micron)? Assume a value of Kb = 10 kT and\nnegligible change in total volume during the pinching process.\nb) (5 pts) Do you expect to find many small vesicles in an ensemble if the system above\nis at thermal equilibrium and the pinching process is reversible? Assume that there is a\nsmall change in total volume which is just enough to prevent the membrane from being in\na state of tension after the pinching process (ie only bending energy is important).\nLipid membrane tethers can be created by exerting a force at a point on the surface of a\ncell. The lipid bilayer separates from the associated cortex and forms a thin (much\nsmaller radius than the cell itself), long cylindrical shaped tether. The tether is composed\nof mostly lipids and does not contain a cortex or cytoskeleton.\nIn the experiment shown in the figure below a small bead is attached to the surface of\nneutrophil cell held immobile by a micropipette and a force is exerted on the bead using\noptical tweezers. This type of experiment can be used to measure the adhesion energy per\nunit area (J) between the lipid bilayer and the cortex.\nmembrane tether\nL\nF\n2r\nmicropipette\n\nc) (5 pts) First develop a simple expression for the energy cost dU to create extra surface\ndA for a system with constant tension N. You can neglect contributions from thermal\nundulations and effects of adhesion.\nd) (15 pts) Using the experimental setup described above one can apply a force F to the\nbead and measure the change in length of an existing tether by an amount dL. Develop\nan expression which relates the quantity FdL to J and other dominant mechanical\nproperties of the neutrophil for this type of deformation. You can neglect any\ncontribution from the cytoskeleton and thermal undulations of the membrane. Assume the\nradii of the neutrophil, R, and the tether, r, do not change during the course of the\nexperiment. Typical values for these quantities are R=5 mm and r = 50 nm.\nContunued on next page....\n\nPROLEM 2: TISSUE MECHANICS (35 Points)\nAs the wall of an artery expands and contracts due to arterial pressure variations, there is\na tendency for fluid to be periodically drawn into and expelled from the tissue comprising\nthe wall. In this problem, you will model the arterial wall as a poroelastic material and\nanalyze this fluid motion. This is of special interest in the context of arterial disease\nsince this represents one method by which lipids normally found in the blood plasma\nmight enter the arterial wall where they could react with extracellular matrix proteins and\nform the nucleus for lipid aggregation (see e.g., Yin et al., A model for the initiation and\ngrowth of extracellular lipid liposomes in arterial intima. Am J Physiol. 1997 Feb;272(2\nPt 2):H1033-46.).\nAssume here that:\n- the wall is thin compared to the radius of the artery, so that you can treat the wall\nlocally as though it were a flat plate. With this assumption, the change in vessel\ncircumference with time can be expressed in terms of a time-varying value of e11\n= e0sin(wt) (see Fig. 1).\n- since the total length of the arterial segment does not change during a cardiac\ne\ncycle, you may assume that e33 = 0. Consequently, there will be a tendency for\n22 to vary with time. Note that this does not imply that t33 = 0.\n- the bottom surface is impermeable, so that all the fluid inflow and outflow occurs\nthrough the top surface (x2 = h). The top surface can be assumed to be exposed to\na constant pressure p = 0 for all times, so that the fluid flow into and out of the\narterial wall is driven entirely by the imposed time varying strain e11.\nFig. 1\ne33=0\ne11\nx2\nx1\nx3\na) (10 pts) First consider the tissue to be a homogeneous, isotropic,\nincompressible (n = 0.5) and linearly elastic (not poroelastic) material, and obtain\n\nexpressions for e22(x2,t) and u2(x2,t). Note, in particular, whether or not e22\ndepends upon x2.\nb) (10 pts) Now treat the tissue as a poroelastic rather than an elastic material,\nwith known values for the shear modulus G and Lame' constant l. Show that u2\nsatisfies the following relationship:\n∂u2\n∂2u2\n= Hk\n∂t\n∂x2\n(which is the same as that which governs one-dimensional confined compression\nas was discussed in class) where H = 2G+l and k is the hydraulic permeability.\nc) (5 pts) Consider the limit of w Æ - and obtain an expression for u2(x2,t).\n(Hint: Think in physical terms what happens in this limiting case, and do not\nsimply set ∂u2 /∂t to zero!)\nd) (5 pts) Consider the limit of w Æ 0 and obtain an expression for u2(x2,t). (Hint:\nWhat boundary condition must be satisfied at x2 = h?)\ne) (5 pts) What are the two boundary conditions needed to solve the equation you\nobtained in (b)? Sketch (but do not solve) the solution u2(x2,t) for the\nintermediate case, when w is neither very large nor very small.\nContinued on next page....\n\nPROLEM 3: CELL MECHANICS (25 Points)\nSeveral recent studies have shown that subtle mutations in lamin, a protein whose\nprimary role is in providing structural stability to the nuclear membrane, are implicated in\na variety of pathologies. In order to investigate these structural changes, experiments are\nto be conducted on nuclei isolated from normal and lamin-deficient cells. The isolated\nnuclei are allowed to settle onto a rigid surface, then probed using the tip of an atomic\nforce microscope (AFM). In the interpretation of the force-displacement (F-d)\nrelationship obtained from these experiments, two different models are proposed. In\nboth, the nucleus is assumed to be initially spherical with radius R. You may assume that\nin all cases, deformations are small and linearity can be assumed.\na) (15 pts) In the first model, the nucleus is treated as a homogeneous, isotropic, linear\nelastic material (the membrane is neglected) with shear modulus G and Poisson's ratio n.\nRecognizing that the total displacement of the AFM tip represents deformations both on\nthe top and bottom of the nucleus, obtain an expression that shows how the tip\ndisplacement d depends on the applied force F and the properties of the elastic sphere.\nb) (10 pts) Now consider the nucleus to be modeled as a spherical shell that deforms\nexclusively due to bending. That is, the membrane exhibits no intrinsic surface tension,\nand its extensional modulus is sufficiently high that there is no significant areal strain.\nThus, the only structural parameter of interest is the membrane bending stiffness KB.\nObtain a second expression for the relationship between the applied force F and the\ndisplacement of the AFM tip. In your analysis of the bending deformations in the\nvicinity of the AFM tip, you will need to assume that the characteristic distance over\nwhich bending occurs scales with the radius of the cell, R. For this part of the problem\nonly, you can neglect the deformation on the bottom surface relative to that on the top.\nBe sure that your answer makes physical sense!\nelastic,\nhomogeneous\nsphere\nG, n\nthin shell with\nbending\nstiffness KB\nF\nF\nR"

Rev. Lett. 82 1911, 1999) have adsorbed double\nstranded DNA onto a lipid bilayer. One use of the system is to enable fundamental\nstudies of polymer dynamics in reduced dimensions. The bilayer is mobile and so we can\nthink about this system as a flexible polymer undergoing a random walk in two\ndimensions (2-D).\na)\n(10pts) Treat the adsorbed DNA molecule as an ideal Gaussian chain in 2-D.\nDerive the force-extension relationship for this model system (<F> for a given end-to-\nend separation R).\nb)\n(8pts) Does it take more or less force to extend a chain in 2-D versus 3-D to any\ngiven extension? Explain why.\nc)\n(7pts) Under what conditions is your answer in a) valid?\nd)\n(8pts) What will be the qualitative change in the average end-to-end distance of\nthe polymer (no applied force) if the solution is heated from 25 to 50 C (for simplicity\nassume the DNA can be described by the freely-jointed chain mode)? Would you expect\nthe same result for the large protein titin found in sarcomeres which we discussed in\nclass? Recall that titin displayed a 'saw-tooth' force extension behavior due to domain\nunfolding. Explain why.\ne)\n(7pts) Suppose the DNA is denatured such that it is now single stranded. Does it\ntake more or less force to extend a single stranded versus a double stranded DNA to any\ngiven extension? You can assume that both the double stranded and single stranded DNA\nbehave as freely jointed chains. Explain why.\n\nProblem #2 RNA Thermodynamics (30 points total)\nOptical tweezers are a useful tool to study the thermodynamics of single molecules.\nConsider the force-extension data achieved when the folded RNA depicted below is\nstretched. As shown schematically, the RNA has 2 folded hairpin regions which differ in\nsize (small and large).\nForce (pN) 15\nF\nF\nExtension (nm)\na)\n(10pts) From the data estimate the free energy change (in kJ/mol) in going from\ncompletely folded to having just the small hairpin unfolded.\nb)\n(10pts) At equilibrium (no applied forces) what is the ratio of probability of\nhaving just the small hairpin unfold to the probability of being completely folded?\nc)\n(10pts) Now optical tweezers are used to apply a constant force of 5pN to the\nends and the extension is monitored in time. For this experiment, what is the ratio of\nprobability of having just the small hairpin unfold to the probability of being completely\nfolded?\n\nPROLEM 3: LINEAR ELASTICITY (30 Points)\n\nA common test used to measure the elastic properties of biological tissues is biaxial\nextension, in which a uniform normal stress is applied along four edges of a sheet-like\ntissue specimen (see Fig. 1). The front and back surfaces are stress-free.\n\na) (10 pts) Given that a stress σ=σ11=σ22=constant, and that the material is\nisotropic, homogeneous, and linearly elastic with a Young's modulus E and\nPoisson ratio ν, find expressions for the three diagonal elements of the strain\ntensor, ε11, ε22, and ε33.\n\nA biaxial extension test is often conducted on tissues that are sheet-like in vivo. For\nexample, oftentimes a segment of an excised artery or vein is sliced open and laid flat\nprior to biaxial testing. In such cases, it is important to know the state of internal stress\nexperienced by the tissue in the flattened state, prior to the application of stress as in Fig.\n1.\n\nFig. 1\nFig. 2\nσ11\nσ22\nb\n\nb) (8 pts) Given that the initial internal radius of the vessel is R, its axial\ndimension is b, and its thickness is h, what moment must be applied to the\nspecimen in order to lay it flat (Fig. 2)? (For this part of the problem, you may\nassume that the vessel is initially stress-free in the cylindrical configuration and\nthat all stresses are introduced due to bending moments applied at the edges.)\nNow consider the vessel in its normal, inflated state in vivo (Fig. 3a). Experiments have\nshown that, due to remodeling of the vascular wall, circumferential stresses in this\nnormal, inflated state are nearly uniform through the wall. As you found in your\nhomework, this circumferential stress (σθ) equals PR/h where P is internal pressure\n(relative to external, ambient pressure), h is the wall thickness and R is the radius.\nc) (7 pts.) Given that the circumferential stress with an internal pressure Pmax\n(above atmospheric) is uniform, use physical reasoning to obtain a qualitative\nsketch of circumferential stress (σθ) as a function of radial position (r) between\nthe inner and outer walls when internal pressure is zero (equal to external\npressure) (Fig. 3b). We are primarily interested in the mean value and whether\nthe stress is positive (tensile) or negative (compressive). Provide your answer in\nthe form of a qualitative plot of σθ vs. r as shown in Fig. 3c.\nd) (5 pts) When the vessel shown in Fig. 3b is sliced as in Fig. 2 so that no\nstresses or moments are applied to the cut ends, the ring has a tendency to change\nshape (either open up more or close down). How will the vessel geometry\nchange, and why?\nFig. 3a\nP = 0\nFig. 3b\nFig. 3c\nσθ\nr\nP = Pmax\npressure\nslice line\nReduce internal"

Introduction\nDimensional analysis offers a method for reducing complex physical\nproblems to the simplest (that is, most economical) form prior to obtaining\na quantitative answer. Bridgman (1969) explains it thus: \"The principal\nuse of dimensional analysis is to deduce from a study of the dimensions of\nthe variables in any physical system certain limitations on the form of any\npossible relationship between those variables. The method is of great\ngenerality and mathematical simplicity\".\nAt the heart of dimensional analysis is the concept of similarity. In\nphysical terms, similarity refers to some equivalence between two things\nor phenomena that are actually different. For example, under some very\nparticular conditions there is a direct relationship between the forces\nacting on a full-size aircraft and those on a small-scale model of it. The\nquestion is, what are those conditions, and what is the relationship\nbetween the forces? Mathematically, similarity refers to a transformation\nof variables that leads to a reduction in the number of independent\nvariables that specify the problem. Here the question is, what kind of\ntransformation works? Dimensional analysis addresses both these\nquestions. Its main utility derives from its ability to contract, or make\nmore succinct, the functional form of physical relationships. A problem\nthat at first looks formidable may sometimes be solved with little effort\nafter dimensional analysis.\nIn problems so well understood that one can write down in\nmathematical form all the governing laws and boundary conditions, and\nonly the solution is lacking, similarity can also be inferred by normalizing\nall the equations and boundary conditions in terms of quantities that\nspecify the problem and identifying the dimensionless groups that appear\nin the resulting dimensionless equations. This is an inspectional form of\nsimilarity analysis. Since inspectional analysis can take advantage of the\nproblem's full mathematical specification, it may reveal a higher degree of\nsimilarity than a \"blind\" (less informed) dimensional analysis and in that\nsense prove more powerful. Dimensional analysis is, however, the only\noption in problems where the equations and boundary conditions are not\ncompletely articulated, and always useful because it is simple to apply and\nquick to give insight.\nSome of the basic ideas of similarity and dimensional analysis had\nalready surfaced in Fourier's work in the nineteenth century's first quarter,\n\nbut the subject received more methodical attention only toward the close\nof that century, notably in the works of Lord Rayleigh, Reynolds,\nMaxwell, and Froude in England, and Carvallo, Vaschy and a number of\nother scientists and engineers in France (Macagno, 1971)4. By the 1920's\nthe principles were essentially in place: Buckingham's now ubiquitous\nπ-theorem had appeared (Buckingham, 1914), and Bridgman had\npublished the monograph which still remains the classic in the field\n(Bridgman, 1922, 1931). Since then, the literature has grown prodigiously.\nApplications now include aerodynamics, hydraulics, ship design,\npropulsion, heat and mass transfer, combustion, mechanics of elastic and\nplastic structures, fluid-structure interactions, electromagnetic theory,\nradiation, astrophysics, underwater and underground explosions, nuclear\nblasts, impact dynamics, and chemical reactions and processing (see for\nexample Sedov, 1959, Baker et al, 1973, Kurth, 1972, Lokarnik, 1991),\nand also biology (McMahon & Bonner, 1983) and even economics (de\nJong, 1967).\nMost applications of dimensional analysis are not in question, no\ndoubt because they are well supported by experimental facts. The debate\nover the method's theoretical-philosophical underpinnings, on the other\nhand, has never quite stopped festering (e.g. Palacios, 1964).\nMathematicians tend to find in the basic arguments a lack of rigor and are\ntempted to redefine the subject in their own terms (e.g. Brand, 1957),\nwhile physicists and engineers often find themselves uncertain about the\nphysical meanings of the words in terms of which the analysis cast. The\nproblem is that dimensional analysis is based on ideas that originate at\nsuch a substratal point in science that most scientists and engineers have\nlost touch with them. To understand its principles, we must return to some\nof the very fundamental concepts in science.\nDimensional analysis is rooted in the nature of the artifices we\nconstruct in order to describe the physical world and explain its\nfunctioning in quantitative terms. Einstein (1933) has said, \"Pure logical\nthinking cannot yield us any knowledge of the empirical world; all\nknowledge starts from experience and ends in it. Propositions arrived at by\npurely logical means are completely empty as regards reality.\"\n4 See, for example, the very first page of the first volume of James Clerk Maxwell's A\ntreatise on Electricity and Magnetism (third edition, Clarendon Press, Cambridge, 1891;\nrepublished by Dover, New York, 1954)\n\nThis treatise is an attempt to explain dimensional analysis by tracing it\nback to its physical foundations. We will clarify the terms used in\ndimensional analysis, explain why and how it works, remark on its utility,\nand discuss some of the difficulties and questions that typically arise in its\napplication. One single (unremarkable) application in mechanics will be\nused to illustrate the procedure and its pitfalls. The procedure is the same\nin all applications, a great variety of which may be found in the references\nand in the scientific literature at large.\n\n2. Physical Quantities and Equations\n2.1 Physical properties\nScience begins with the observation and precise description of things and\nevents. It is at this very first step that we face the fact upon which\ndimensional analysis rests: Description in absolute terms is impossible.\nWe can do no more than compare one thing with another, to \"catch the\nresemblance of things\". When we say that something \"is\" a tree, we mean\nsimply that it has a set of attributes that are in some way shared by certain\nfamiliar objects we have agreed to call trees.\nOur brains have evolved to the point where we can recognize trees\nalmost instantly, but describing something like a tree is actually a very\ncomplex business. Physics starts by breaking the descriptive process down\ninto simpler terms. An object or event is described in terms of basic\nproperties like length, mass, color, shape, speed, and time. None of these\nproperties can be defined in absolute terms, but only by reference to\nsomething else: an object has the length of a meter stick, we say, the color\nof an orange, the weight of a certain familiar lump of material, or the\nshape of a sphere. The references may be made more precise, but in\nessence \"description\" is simply a noting of the similarities between one\nthing and a set of others that are known to us. We can do no more than\ncompare one thing with another.\nA physical property first arises as a concept based on experience, and\nis formalized by defining a comparison operation for determining whether\ntwo samples of it are equal (A=B) or unequal (A B). (We shall use bold\nsymbols when we are referring not to numerical values, but to actual\nphysical attributes.) This operation, which is an entirely physical\nprocedure, defines the property. Properties of the same kind (or simply, the\nsame properties) are compared by means of the same comparison\noperation. Properties of different kinds cannot be compared because there\nexists no operation that defines equality. Asking whether a particular mass\nis physically equal to a particular length is meaningless: no procedure\nexists for making the comparison.\nIf a property is defined only in terms of a comparison operation, we\nhave a procedure for establishing whether two samples of it are equal or\nunequal, but no concept of what it means for one to be larger or smaller\nthan the other. Shape and color are examples. We have procedures for\n\ndetermining if two objects have the same shape, or the same color. But\nasking whether a square shape is smaller or larger than a circular shape, or\nwhether green is smaller or larger than white, makes no sense. Properties\nlike shape and color are useful for describing things, but cannot play a role\nin any quantitative analysis, which deals with relative magnitudes.\n2.2 Physical quantities and base quantities\nScience begins with observation and description, but its ultimate goal is to\ninfer from those observations laws that express the phenomena of the\nphysical world in the simplest and most general (that is, most economical)\nterms. That the language of mathematics is ideally suited for expressing\nthose laws is not accidental, but follows from the constraints we put on the\ntypes of physical properties that are allowed to appear in quantitative\nanalysis. The allowed types of properties are called \"physical quantities\".\nPhysical quantities are of two types: base quantities and derived\nquantities. The base quantities, which are defined in entirely physical\nterms, form a complete set of basic building blocks for an open-ended\nsystem of \"derived\" quantities that may be introduced as necessary. The\nbase and derived quantities together provide a rational basis for describing\nand analyzing the physical world in quantitative terms.\nA base quantity is defined by specifying two physical operations:\na comparison operation for determining whether two samples A\nand B of the property are equal (A=B) or unequal (A B), and\nan addition operation that defines what is meant by the sum\nC=A+B of two samples of the property.\nBase quantities with the same comparison and addition operations are of\nthe same kind (that is, different examples of the same quantity). The\naddition operation A+B defines a physical quantity C of the same kind as\nthe quantities being added. Quantities with different comparison and\naddition operations cannot be compared or added; no procedures exist for\nexecuting such operations. All physical quantities are properties of\nphysical things or events. They are not themselves physical things or\nevents. The comparison and addition operations involve physical\n\nmanipulations of objects or events that possess the property under\nconsideration (see the examples below).\nThe comparison and addition operations are physical, but they are\nrequired to have certain properties that mimic those of the corresponding\nmathematical operations for pure numbers:\nA=B and\nB=C, then A=C), and\nA+B=B+A), associative\n[A+(B+C)=(A+B)+C], and unique (if A+B=C, there exists no finite\nD such that A+B+D=C).\nThe two operations together define, in entirely physical terms,\nfinite B such that A+B=C, then C>A),\n(2) subtraction of like quantities (if A+B=C, then A C-B),\npure number (if B=A+A+A,\nthen B 3A), and\npure number (if A=B+B+B, then\nB A/3).\nA base quantity is thus a property for which the following mathematical\noperations are defined in physical terms: comparison, addition,\nsubtraction, multiplication by a pure number, and division by a pure\nnumber. Each of these operations is performed on physical properties of\nthe same kind and yields a physical property of that kind, and each\nphysical operation obeys the same rules as the corresponding\nmathematical operation for pure numbers.\nThis sets the stage for not only \"catching the resemblance of things\",\nbut also expressing that resemblance in the language of mathematics.\nIt is important to note that mathematical operations other than the ones\nlisted above are not defined in physical terms. No defining operation exists\nfor forming a tangible entity that represents the product of a mass and a\ntime, for example, or, for that matter, the product of one length and\nanother (more on this later). Nor can we point to some tangible thing that\n\"is\" the cube root of a length, say, or the natural logarithm of a time.\nProducts, ratios, powers, and exponential and other functions such as\n(1) The comparison operation must obey the identity law (if\n(2) the addition operation must be commutative (\n(1) the concept of larger and smaller for like quantities (if there exists a\n(3) multiplication of a physical quantity by a\n(4) division of a physical quantity by a\n\ntrigonometric functions and logarithms are defined for numbers, but have\nno physical correspondence in operations involving actual physical\nquantities.\nFigure 2.1 illustrates the comparison and addition operations of some\nwell-known physical quantities that can be chosen as base quantities. The\nfigure shows them in simplistic, cartoon-like terms, but we are of course\naware that each operation is actually associated with a carefully articulated\nprocedure and a set of concepts that are often quite complex. For our\npresent purpose we take these for granted, much like Dr. Samuel Johnson\nwho, when queried about how he knew that the physical world really\nexisted, satisfied himself by stamping his foot on the pavement.\nFigure 2.1a: The comparison and addition operations of length.\nFigure 2.1b: The comparison and addition operations of mass.\n\nFigure 2.1c: The comparison and addition operations of area.\nFigure 2.1d: The comparison and addition operations of velocity.\nFigure 2.1e: The comparison and addition operations of force.\nThe comparison and addition operations for length and mass are\nfamiliar. Only one comment is necessary: the mass referred to in the figure\nis the \"gravitational mass\", for which equality is defined by the statement\n\nthat two masses are equal if a third mass exerts the same gravitational\nforce on each of them separately at the same relative position.\nTime is omitted from the figure, largely because its defining\noperations defy illustration in such simplistic terms. The concept of time is\ndeeply rooted in our biological beings. It is, after all, the warp of our\nexistence, the stuff, as some wit pointed out, that keeps everything from\nhappening at once. Time characterizes an event, not a thing. Aristotle\nreferred to time as a \"dimension of motion\", which pleases the poet in us,\nbut leaves the scientist unmoved. We do best if we adopt a pragmatic\nnotion of time and think of it as being defined in terms of comparison and\naddition operations involving idealized clocks or stopwatches, much like\nEinstein did in his popular exposition of the theory of relativity (Einstein,\n1952). Whether those clocks are hourglasses or atomic clocks will affect\nthe precision of the operations, but not their intrinsic character. What time\n\"is\" has no relevance in the present context, only the defining operations\nmatter5.\nThe concept of force arises in primitive terms from muscular effort,\nand is formalized based on the observation that a net force on an object\n(the vector sum of all the forces acting on the object) causes a rate of\nchange in its velocity. Directionality is important in the definition: force is\na vector quantity.\nA reader accustomed to considering speed as \"distance divided by\ntime\" and area as \"length squared\" may be surprised to see them included\nin figure 2.1 as (possible) base quantities with their own comparison and\naddition operations. We include them to show that the set of base\nquantities is very much a matter of choice. Velocity (or speed, if direction\nis presumed) is a certain property of motion. A self-propelled toy car\nrunning across a tabletop has a speed, and we can define acceptable\nprocedures for establishing whether two speeds are equal or unequal and\nfor adding two speeds, as in figure 2.1d. Speed can therefore be taken as a\nbase quantity, should we choose to do so. The same goes for area. Note\nthat two areas may be equal without being congruent, provided one of\n5 Sir Arthur Eddinton (1939): \"It has come to be accepted practice in introducing new\nphysical quantities that they shall be regarded as defined by the series of measuring\noperations and calculations of which they are the result. Those who associate with the\nresult a mental picture of some entity disporting itself in a metaphysical realm of\nexistence do so at their own risk; physics can accept no responsibility for this\nembellishment\".\n\nthem can be \"cut up\" and reassembled (added back together) into a form\nwhich is congruent with the other: the addition operation is invoked in\nmaking a comparison, and the comparison operation in addition.\nWe have said that shape and color, though acceptable physical\nproperties, cannot be base quantities because they lack acceptable addition\noperations. That shape is disqualified is obvious: what is the sum of a\nsquare and a circle? But why is color disqualified? We know that color in\nthe form of light can be added according to well-defined rules, as when\nred light added to green produces yellow. Is this not an acceptable\ndefinition of physical addition? The answer is no. Blue equals blue. But\naccording to this addition operation, blue plus blue also equals blue. The\naddition operation is not unique: nA=A for any color A, where n is any\nnumber. This disqualifies color from the ranks of physical quantities (and\nmakes measurement of color in terms of a unit impossible). But, the\npersistent reader may argue, the color of an object can be identified by the\nwavelength of light reflected from it, and wavelength can be added. Is this\nnot acceptable for an addition rule? The answer is again no. This is a rule\nfor adding lengths, not for adding the property we perceive as color.\n2.3 Unit and numerical value\nThe two operations that define a base quantity make it possible to\nexpress any such quantity as a multiple of a standard sample of its own\nkind, that is, to \"measure it in terms of a unit\". The standard sample--the\nunit--may be chosen arbitrarily. The comparison operation allows the\nreplication of the unit, and the addition operation allows the identification\nand replication of fractions of the unit. The measuring process consists of\nphysically adding replicas of the unit and fractions thereof until the sum\nequals the quantity being measured (figure 2.2). A count of the number\nof whole and fractional units required yields the numerical value of\nthe quantity being measured. If a is the unit chosen for quantities of type\nA, the process of measurement yields a numerical value A (a number)\nsuch that\nA = Aa\n(2.1)\nThe measurement process is entirely physical. The only mathematics\ninvolved is the counting of the number of whole and fractional units once\n\nphysical equality has been established between the quantity being\nmeasured and a sum of replicas of the unit and fractions thereof.\nFigure 2.2: Measurement in terms of a unit and numerical value\nIt should be emphasized that numbers can be ascribed to properties in\nmany arbitrary ways, but such numbers will not represent numerical\nvalues of physical quantities unless they are assigned by a procedure\nconsistent with the one defined above.\nThe numerical value of a base quantity depends on the choice of unit.\nA physical quantity exists, independent of the choice of unit. My\nforefinger has the same length, regardless of whether I measure it in\ncentimeters or inches. A quantity A can be measured in terms of a unit a or\nin terms of another unit a', but the quantity itself remains physically the\nsame, that is,\nA = Aa = A'a'.\n(2.2)\nIf the unit a' is n times larger than a,\na' =na,\n(2.3)\nit follows from equation (2.2) that\nA′ = n\n-1A .\n(2.4)\nIf the size of a base quantity's unit is changed by a factor n, the quantity's\nnumerical value changes by a factor n-1 .\nBy convention, all base quantities of the same kind are always\nmeasured in terms of the same unit. All base quantities of the same kind\n\nthus change by the same factor when the size of that quantity's unit is\nchanged. That is, the ratio of the numerical values of any two quantities of\nthe same kind is independent of base unit size.\nNote also that when base quantities of the same kind are added\nphysically (A+B=C), the numerical values satisfy an equation of the same\nform as the physical quantity equation (A+B=C), regardless of the size of\nthe chosen unit. In other words, the numerical value equation mimics the\nphysical equation, and its form is independent of the unit's size.\n2.4 Derived quantities, dimensions, and dimensionless quantities\nIn describing physical things and events quantitatively, we refer to\nnumerical values of base quantities, and also introduce numbers derived\nby inserting these values into certain mathematical formulas. We\ndetermine the distance L that an object moves in time t, for example, and\ncalculate its speed V=Lt-1; or we measure a body's mass m and speed V and\ncalculate its kinetic energy K=mV2/2. These numbers are derived\nquantities of the first kind.\nNot all numbers obtained by inserting base quantities into formulas\ncan be considered physical quantities6. Base quantities have a\ntransparently physical origin, which gives rise to the fact that the ratio of\nany two samples of a base quantity remains constant when the base unit\nsize is changed; an arbitrary choice cannot affect a relative physical\nmagnitude. Bridgman (1931) postulated that this is in fact a defining\nattribute of all physical quantities. This is\nBridgman's principle of absolute significance of relative magnitude:\nA number Q obtained by inserting the numerical values of base\nquantities into a formula is a physical quantity if the ratio of any\ntwo samples of it remains constant when base unit sizes are\nchanged.\nBridgman went on to show (Bridgman, 1931; see also the proof by\nBarenblatt, 1996) that a monomial formula satisfies the principle of\n6 From this point on, the term quantity will be used for the numerical value of a physical\nquantity, unless otherwise noted.\n\nabsolute significance of relative magnitude only if it has the power-law\nform\nA\naB\nbC\nc ...\n(2.5)\nQ =\nwhere A, B, C, etc. are numerical values of base quantities and the\ncoefficient\nand exponents a, b, c, etc. are real numbers whose values\ndistinguish one type of derived quantity from another. All monomial\nderived quantities have this power-law form; no other form represents a\nphysical quantity.\nA derived quantity of the first kind is defined in terms of a numerical\nvalue, which depends on the choice of base units. A derived quantity does\nnot necessarily represent something tangible in the same sense as a base\nquantity, although it may. The square root of time, for example, is a\nderived quantity because it has the required power-law form, but we\ncannot point to any physical thing that \"is\" the square root of time.\nTo avoid talking of \"units\" for quantities that may have no physical\nrepresentation, but whose numerical values nevertheless depend on the\nchoice of base units, we introduce the concept of dimension. Each type of\nbase quantity has by definition its own dimension. If A is the numerical\nvalue of a length, we say it \"has the dimension of length\", and write this as\n[A]=L where the square brackets imply \"the dimension of\" and L\nsymbolizes the concept of length. By this we mean simply that if the\nlength unit size is increased by a factor n, the numerical value A will\nincrease by a factor n-1 .\nThe dimension of a derived quantity conveys the same information in\ngeneralized form, for derived as well as base quantities. Consider a\nquantity defined by the formula\nl 2\nm2\nQ = L\nl\n1 L2 ...M1\nm1 M2 ...t1\n1 t2 ...\n(2.6)\nwhere the Li's are numerical values of certain lengths, Mi's of certain\nmasses, and ti's of certain times, and\nand all exponents are real numbers.\nIf the length unit is changed by a factor nL , the mass unit by a factor nm ,\nand the time unit by a factor nt , it follows from equations (2.4) and (2.6)\nthat the value of Q changes to\nQ′ = n\n-1Q\n(2.7a)\n\nwhere\n∑ li\n∑ mi\n∑ ti\nn = (nL )\n(nm )\n(n )\n.\n(2.7b)\nt\nThis implies that Q transforms like the numerical value of a base quantity\n∑mi\n∑ i\nwith a unit whose size is proportional to L\n∑liM t , where L, M, and t\nrepresent the sizes of the length, mass, and time units, respectively. By\nanalogy with the meaning of dimension for base quantities [see equation\n(2.4)], we therefore say that the derived quantity Q has the dimension\n∑ ti\n[Q] = (L)\n∑ l i (M)\n∑ mi (t)\n.\n(2.8)\nWhether applied to a base or derived quantity, the dimension is simply\na formulaic indication of how the quantity's numerical value transforms\nwhen the sizes of the base units are changed. A derived quantity's\ndimension follows from its defining equation. To obtain the result (2.8) for\nthe quantity defined in equation (2.6), we simply substitute for each base\nquantity in equation (2.6) the symbol for its dimension, omit the numerical\ncoefficient α, and obtain equation (2.8) by algebra. The dimension of a\n-2\nkinetic energy mV\n2 2, for example, is M(\n)\nL t\n= ML\n2t .\nStatements to the effect that a quantity's dimension is an \"expression\nof its essential physical nature\" (Tolman, 1917) are either a meaningless\ntautology (in the case of base quantities) or nonsense (in the case of\nderived quantities). We shall see that a quantity's dimension depends on\nthe choice of the system of units, and is therefore under the control of the\nobserver rather than an inherent attribute of that quantity.\nBy convention, a particular derived quantity is specified by its\nnumerical value followed by the base units upon which that value is based,\nthe latter arranged in a form which reflects the quantity's dimension. The\nstatement Q = 0.021kg s1/2 implies that Q is a quantity with dimension\nMt\n1 2and has a magnitude 0.021 if mass is measured in kilograms and\ntime in seconds. Speaking loosely, it may be said that the quantity Q is\n\"measured in units of kg s1/2\", which implies both its dimension and the\nbase units on which the indicated value is based. In common parlance the\nterms unit and dimension are often used synonymously, but such usage is\nundesirable in a treatise where fundamental understanding is paramount.\n\nSome important points about derived quantities:\n1. The dimension of any derived physical quantity is a product of\npowers of the base quantity dimensions.\n2. Sums of derived quantities with the same dimension are derived\nquantities of the same dimension. Products and ratios of derived quantities\nare also derived quantities, with dimensions which are usually different\nfrom the original quantities.\n3. All derived quantities with the same dimension change their values\nby the same factor when the sizes of the base units are changed.\n4. A derived quantity is dimensionless if its numerical value remains\ninvariant when the base units are changed. An example is\n, where\nVt L\nV =\nis a velocity, t is a time and L is a length. The dimension of a\ndx dt\ndimensionless quantity is unity, the factor by which the quantity's\nnumerical value changes when base units sizes are changed.\n5. Special functions (logarithmic, exponential, trigonometric, etc.) of\ndimensional derived quantities are in general not derived quantities\nbecause their values do not in general transform like derived quantities\nwhen base unit size changes. Only when the arguments of these functions\nare dimensionless will the arguments and therefore the values of the\nfunctions remain invariant when units are changed. Special functions with\ndimensionless arguments are therefore derived quantities with dimension\nunity.\n2.5 Physical equations, dimensional homogeneity, and physical\nconstants\nIn quantitative analysis of physical events one seeks mathematical\nrelationships between the numerical values of the physical quantities that\ndescribe the event. We are not, however, interested in just any\nrelationships that may apply between the values of physical quantities. A\nprimitive soul may find it remarkable, or even miraculous, that his own\nmass in kilograms is exactly equal to his height in inches. We dismiss this\nkind of \"relationship\" as an accidental result of the choice of units.\nScience is concerned only with expressing a physical relationship between\none quantity and a set of others, that is, with \"physical equations.\" Nature\nis indifferent to the arbitrary choices we make when we pick base units.\nWe are interested, therefore, only in numerical relationships that remain\ntrue independent of base unit size.\n\nThis puts certain constraints on the allowable form of physical\nequations. Suppose that, in a specified physical event, the numerical value\nQo of a physical quantity is determined by the numerical values of a set\nQ1...Q other physical quantities, that is,\nn\nQo = f (Q1,Q2,...,Qn ),\n(2.9)\nThe principle of absolute significance of relative values tells us that the\nrelationship implied by equation (2.9) can be physically relevant only if Qo\nand f change by the same factor when the magnitudes of any base units are\nchanged. In other words, a physical equation must be dimensionally\nhomogeneous. Some reflection based on the points summarized at the end\nof Section 2.4 will show that dimensional homogeneity imposes the\nfollowing constraints on any mathematical representation of a relationship\nlike equation (2.9):\n(1) both sides of the equation must have the same dimension;\n(2) wherever a sum of quantities appears in f, all the terms in the sum\nmust have the same dimension;\n(3) all arguments of any exponential, logarithmic, trigonometric or\nother special functions that appear in f must be dimensionless.\nFor example, if a physical equation is represented by\nA = Be\n-C -(D1 + D2) + F ,\n(2.10)\nE\nC must be dimensionless, D1 and D must have the same dimension, and A,\nB, D/E and F must have the same dimension.\nAn important consequence of dimensional homogeneity is that the\nform of a physical equation is independent of the size of the base units.\nThe following example may help to illustrate the reason for\ndimensional homogeneity in physical equations and show how conceptual\nerrors that may arise if homogeneity isn't recognized. Suppose we release\nan object from rest in a uniform gravitational field, in vacuum, and ask\nwhat distance x it will fall in a time t. We know of course that elementary\nNewtonian mechanics gives the answer as\n\nx = gt ,\n(2.11)\nwhere g is the local acceleration of gravity and has the dimension Lt-2 .\nThis equation expresses the result of a general physical law, and is clearly\ndimensionally homogeneous.\nThe physical basis of dimensional homogeneity becomes apparent\nwhen we consider the same phenomenon from a different perspective.\nSuppose we are ignorant of mechanics and conduct a large variety of\nexperiments in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on the time t it takes a body\nwith mass m to fall a distance x from rest in an evacuated chamber. After\nperforming experiments with numerous masses and distances, we find that\nif t is measured in seconds and x in meters, all our data can be accurately\nrepresented, regardless of mass, with the single equation\nx = 4.91t\n2.\n(2.12)\nThis is a perfectly correct equation. It describes and predicts all\nexperiments (in Cambridge, Massachusetts) to a very good accuracy.\nHowever, it appears at first glance to be dimensionally non-homogeneous,\nthe two sides seemingly having different dimensions, and thus appears not\nto be a true physical equation. This impression is, however, based on the\nfalse presumption that the coefficient 4.91 remains invariant when units\nare changed. In fact, the coefficient 4.91 represents not a dimensionless\nnumber, but a particular numerical value of a dimensional physical\nquantity which characterizes the relationship between x and t in the\nCambridge area. That this must be so becomes clear when we consider\nhow equation (2.12) must transform when units are changed. We know\nthat when units are changed, the actual physical distance x remains\ninvariant, and we therefore argue that to obtain the falling distance in feet,\nfor example, the right hand side of equation (2.12), which gives it in\nmeters, must be multiplied by 3.28, the number of feet in one meter.\nThus, if x is measured in feet and t in seconds, the correct version of\nequation (2.12) is\nx = 16.1t\n2 .\n(2.13)\n\nThis same transformation could also have been obtained by arguing that\nequation (2.12), being an expression of a general physical law, must,\naccording to Bridgman's principle of absolute significance of relative\nmagnitude, be dimensionally homogeneous, and therefore should properly\nhave been written\nx = ct\n(c = 4.91ms\n-2 )\n(2.14)\nThis form makes clear that the coefficient c is a physical quantity rather\nthan a numerical coefficient. The units of c indicate its dimension and\nshow that a change of the length unit from meters to feet, with the time\nunit remaining invariant, changes c by the factor 3.28, the inverse of the\nfactor by which the length unit is changed. This gives c=16.1 ft s-2, as in\nequation (2.13).\nEquation (2.14) is the correct way of representing the data of equation\n(2.11). It is dimensionally homogeneous, and makes the transformation to\ndifferent base units straightforward.\nEvery correct physical equation--that is, every equation that expresses\na physically significant relationship between numerical values of physical\nquantities--must be dimensionally homogeneous. A fitting formula\nderived from correct empirical data may at first sight appear dimensionally\nnon-homogeneous because it is intended for particular base units. Such\nformulas can always be rewritten in general, homogeneous form by the\nfollowing procedure (Bridgman, 1931):\n(1) Replace all the numerical coefficients in the equation with unknown\ndimensional constants.\n(2) Determine the dimensions of these constants by requiring that the new\nequation be dimensionally homogeneous.\n(3) Determine the numerical values of the constants by matching them\nwith those in the original equation when the units are the same.\nThis is of course how equation (2.14) was derived from equation\n(2.12).\nAnother example serves to reinforce this point. Suppose it is found that\nthe pressure distribution in the earth's atmosphere over much of the United\nStates can be represented (approximately) by the formula\n\n-0.00012z\np = 1.01x10\n5 e\n(2.15)\nwhere p is the pressure in Nm-2 and z is the altitude in meters. This\nexpression applies only with the cited units. The correct, dimensionally\nhomogeneous form of this equation is\n-bz\n-1)\np = ae\n( a = 1.01× 10\n5 Nm\n-2, b = 0.00012m\n(2.16)\nwhere a and b are physical quantities. In this form the equation is valid\nindependent of the chosen base units. The dimensions of a and b indicate\nhow these quantities change when units are changed.\nThe two quantities a and b in equation (2.16) are physical constants in\nthe sense that their values are fixed once the system of units is chosen. In\nthis case the constants characterize a particular environment⎯the pressure\ndistribution in the earth's atmosphere over the US. Similarly, the\nacceleration of gravity g in equation (2.11) is a physical constant that\ncharacterizes the (local!) gravitational force field at the earth's surface.\nThe basic laws of physics also contain a number of universal physical\nconstants whose magnitudes are the same in all problems once the system\nof units is chosen: the speed of light in vacuum c, the universal\ngravitational constant G, Planck's constant h, Boltzmann's constant kB,\nand many others.\n2.6 Derived quantities of the second kind\nThe classification of quantities as base or derived is not unique. There\nexist general laws that bind different kinds of quantities together in certain\nrelationships, and these laws can be used to transform base quantities into\nderived ones. Such transformations are useful because they reduce the\nnumber of units that must be chosen arbitrarily, and simplify the forms of\nphysical laws.\nArea, for example, may be taken as a base quantity with its own\ncomparison and addition operations, and measured in terms of an\narbitrarily chosen (base) unit: a certain postage stamp, say, to use an\nabsurd example. The floor area of a room may be measured by covering\nthe floor with copies of this postage stamp and parts thereof, and counting\nthe number of whole stamps required. If we adopt this practice we will\neventually find that, regardless of the unit we have chosen for measuring\n\nan area A, its numerical value A will depend on its linear dimensions\naccording to\nA = c∫dxdy\n(2.17)\nwhere the integral is taken over the area and c is a dimensional constant\nthe magnitude of which depends on the choice of base units of area and\nlength. Dimensional homogeneity requires that c be a derived quantity,\nA\nc = ∫dxdy\n(2.18)\nwith dimension AL-2 .\nEquation (2.17) can be thought of as a \"physical law.\" A little\nreflection reveals, however, that it holds simply because the quantity we\nhave symbolized as dxdy is defined by comparison and addition rules that\nhappen to be similar to those we have chosen for area. Equation (2.17) is\nthus not really a law of nature, but one have crafted ourselves.\nDimensional constants like c in Equation (2.17) whose values depend\non the choice of units but are entirely independent of the problem being\nconsidered are called universal constant.\nThe law (2.17) suggests a simplification. If we choose to measure area\nin terms of a unit that is defined by the area of a square with sides equal to\nthe length unit, the physical coefficient c becomes unity, and equation\n(2.17) becomes\nA = ∫dxdy\n(2.19)\nArea, in effect, has become a derived quantity that is defined in terms of\noperations involving length. Equation (2.19) does not imply that area now\n\"is\", in any physical sense, length squared. The physical property that is\narea remains what it was before, quite distinct from length, and for that\nmatter quite distinct from \"length squared\", of which we have no physical\nconcept whatsoever. We have simply noted that, because our concepts of\n\"integral\" and \"area\" are in fact similar, we may choose to measure area\nvia operations involving length, and have made a decision to do so. The\nfact that area now has the dimension L2 simply indicates that the numerical\n\nvalue of any area so defined will change by a factor n\n-2 when the length\nunit is changed by a factor n.\nBy transforming area in this way from a base to a derived quantity, we\nhave accomplished two simplifications: the length unit automatically\ndetermines the area unit, and the dimensional physical constant c in\nequation (2.17) is replaced with unity.\nThere is nothing sacred about choosing c=1 in this kind of\ntransformation. We could have adopted as the unit for area circle with\ndiameter equal to one length unit, in which case area would have been\ndefined by\nhave been perfectly acceptable, but less convenient since it would force us\nto waste a lot of paper writing unnecessary 4/π's. In other instances,\ndimensionless coefficients other than unity are introduced deliberately to\nmake things more convenient. For example, by defining the kinetic energy\nas K = mV\n2 2 instead of K = mV\n2 we make the energy equation for a\npoint mass in a force field read K+U=constant instead of K/2+U=constant,\nwhere U is the force potential. Similarly, the 4π terms that appear in the SI\nsystem of units in the integral forms of Gauss's and Ampere's laws are\nplaced there in order to eliminate numerical coefficients in the differential\nforms (Maxwell's field equations).\nA = ( 4 / )∫dxdy instead of by equation (2.19). This would\nSpeed offers an example similar to area. We may define speed as a\nbase quantity with its own comparison and addition operations, and\nchoose for it a base unit--the speed of a certain very reliable wind-up toy\non a horizontal surface, say, to use again an absurd example. If we take\nthis route we would eventually discover that the quantity we have\nidentified as speed is in fact proportional to the distance covered in unit\ntime. We can then choose to define speed as the derived quantity V=dx/dt,\nwhich is equivalent to choosing a speed unit such that unit distance is\ncovered in unit time.\nA more interesting example arises with force. Force may be taken as a\nbase quantity with an arbitrarily specified unit--the (equilibrium) force\nrequired to extend a standard spring a given distance, say. Newton's\noriginal law of motion states that if a body (a \"point mass\", to be precise)\nof mass m is subjected to a net force F (in the x-direction, say) under non\nrelativistic conditions, it accelerates in the direction of the force and the\nacceleration a = d\n2 x dt\n2 is related to the force F and mass m by\nF = cma\n(2.20)\n\nwhere the coefficient c is a universal constant with dimension Ft2M-1L-1 if\nforce, length, mass and time are all selected as base quantities. Equation\n(2.20) is a general physical law which expresses a relationship between the\nnumerical values of three different physical quantities that are involved in\nthe dynamics of a point mass--force, (gravitational) mass, and\nacceleration.\nWe are at liberty, however, to choose a force unit such that one unit of\nforce will give unit mass unit acceleration under non-relativistic\nconditions. If we do this, we make c=1 in equation (2.20) and throw\nNewton's law into the coefficient-less form\nF = ma\n(2.21)\nwhere force has a dimension MLt-2. Equation (2.21) does not imply that\nforce \"is\" in any physical sense a mass times an acceleration. The product\nof a mass times an acceleration is in fact not defined in physical terms, and\nin any case, a force can exist without there being any mass or acceleration\ninvolved, as for example when I push on an immobile brick wall (and the\nwall exerts an equal and opposite counter-force on me). In contrast with\nthe examples of area and speed, equation (2.21) does not in all cases\nprovide a recipe for directly evaluating a force by making in situ\nmeasurements of base quantities. Instead, we have imparted to force the\ncharacter of a derived quantity by making the force unit depend in a\nparticular way on the units of mass and length.\nQuantities that are transferred into the derived category by choosing a\nunit motivated by a general physical law are called derived quantities of\nthe second kind. Force is one example; heat and electric charge are also\ntreated in this way in the SI system.\n2.7 Systems of units\nA system of units is defined by\n(1) a complete set of base quantities with their defining comparison and\naddition operations,\n(2) the base units, and\n\n(3) all relevant derived quantities, expressed in terms of their defining\nequations (e.g V=dx/dt), if they are of the first kind, or the forms of the\nphysical laws that define their units (e.g. F=ma defines the force unit\nin the SI system), if they are of the second kind.\nThe set of derived quantities is open-ended; new ones may be introduced\nat will in any analysis.\nSystems of units are said to be of the same type if they differ only in\nthe magnitudes of the base units.\nIn the SI system (Systeme International) there are six base quantities\n(table 2.1): length, time, mass, temperature, current, number of elementary\nparticles, and luminous intensity. The units of length, time and mass are\nthe meter (m), the second (s) and the kilogram (kg), respectively. Force is\nmade a derived quantity by writing Newton's law as F=ma.\nThe temperature in any system of units must be a thermodynamic\ntemperature. Numbers read from an arbitrarily constructed thermometer\nscale can be used for establishing whether two temperatures are equal, but\nthey are not numerical values of a physical quantity. (Is 2oC \"twice as hot\"\nas 1oC ? Is 0oC \"zero\" temperature in the sense of there being an absence\nof temperature? For that matter, if temperature is defined in terms of a\nthermometer with an arbitrarily marked temperature scale, is there any\nreason why heat should flow from a \"higher\" to a \"lower\" temperature?)\nThe thermodynamic (or absolute) temperature is, however, defined in\nterms of physical comparison and addition operations appropriate to a base\nquantity7. Measurements via a Carnot engine or equivalent device yield\nthe ratio of two absolute temperatures; the temperature unit (i.e. the size of\nthe \"degree\") must be chosen arbitrarily. The SI temperature unit is the\nkelvin (K), which is defined as the fraction 1/273.16 of the\nthermodynamic temperature of the triple point of water.\nT\n7 The ratio of the numerical values of two physical thermodynamic temperatures T1 and\n2 can for example be defined in terms of the (physically measurable) efficiency η12of a\nCarnot engine which operates between heat reservoirs at the two temperatures. If T1 is the\ntemperature of the reservoir into which heat flows, T1/T2≡1-η12, where η12 is a pure\nnumber. This provides a physical operation for determining the ratio of the numerical\nvalues of T1 and T2, and implies a physical addition for the two quantities: if\nT2=nT1,where n=T2 /T1 , then T1+T2≡T3=(1+n)T1. The temperature T =(1+n)T1 can be\nphysically identified by noting that if a Carnot engine is run between this temperature and\nT1, it will have an efficiency n/(1+n).\n\n- - -\n- - -\n- - -\n- - -\n- - -\n- - -\nTable 2.1: The SI system of units\nBase quantities (complete set)\nQuantity\nSI name\nSI Symbol\nlength, L\nmeter\nm\ntime, t\nsecond\ns\nmass, M\nkilogram\nkg\ntemperature, T\nkelvin\nK\ncurrent, I\nampere\nA\nnumber of elementary particles\nmole\nmol\nluminous intensity\ncandela\ncd\nDerived quantities (incomplete set)\nQuantity\nDefining\nequation/law\nDimension\nDimensional\nSymbol\nName\narea\nvolume\nfrequency\nvelocity\nacceleration\ndensity\nforce\nstress/pressure\nwork/energy\ntorque\npower\nA= ∫dxdy\nV= ∫dxdydz\nf=l/τ\nv=dx/dt\na=d2x/dt2\nρ=M/V\nF=Ma\np=F/A\nW=∫Fdx\nT=Fl\ndW/dt\nL2\nL3\nt-1\nLt-1\nLt-2\nML-3\nMLt-2\nML-1 t-2\nML2t-2\nML2t-2\nML2t-3\nm2\nm3\ns -1\nms-1\nms-2\nkg m-3\nkg m s-2\nN m-2=kg m-1s-2\nN m = kg m2s-2\nN m = kg m2s-2\nJ s-1 = kg m2s-3\nhertz (Hz)\nnewton (N)\npascal (Pa)\njoule (J)\nwatt (W)\ncharge\nQ=∫ldt\nIt\nA s\ncoulomb (C)\nIn SI the electric current is adopted as a base quantity and charge is\nthrown into the derived category (via Q=∫Idt), as are all other electric and\nmagnetic quantities. The unit for current is the ampere (A), which is\n\ndefined as the current which, when passed through each of two infinite,\nparallel conductors in vacuum one meter apart, will produce a force of\n2x10-7 N per unit length on each conductor. The conventional factor 2x10-7\nis introduced for convenience and historical reasons, and appears in the SI\nversion of Ampere's law.\nThe mole unit is retained in SI as an alternative way of specifying\nnumber of things: instead of counting things one by one, one counts them\nin lots of 6.02x1023 (Avagadro's number). One must, however, specify\nwhat things one is counting, e.g. \"one mole of atoms, of molecules, of\ntennis balls\", or whatever. Note that the SI mole is in fact the old \"gram\nmole\".\nLuminous intensity does not refer to radiant energy flow per unit solid\nangle as such, which could be measured in watts per steradian, but only to\nthat portion of it to which \"the human eye\" (as defined by a standard\nresponse curve) is sensitive. At a wavelength of 555 nanometers, where\nthe human eye is most sensitive to light, one candela is equivalent to\n1.46x10-3 watt per steradian.\nAlso included sometimes among the base quantities are two\ndimensionless quantities, plane angle and solid angle, which are measured\nin radians and steradians, respectively. We consider them derived\nquantities because, though dimensionless, they are defined in terms of\noperations involving length, much like area is defined in terms of length\noperations.\nWe note again that the dimension of a derived quantity depends on the\nchoice of system of units, which is under the control of the observer and\nhas nothing to do with the quantity's intrinsic nature. Indeed, quantities\nwith quite different physical meaning, like work and torque, can have the\nsame dimension.\nThe effect of the system of units on the dimensions of quantities is\nillustrated in table 2.2, which shows the dimensions of some mechanical\nquantities in three different types of systems of units. Systems of units are\nof the same type if they have base units of the same kind but different\nmagnitude, and the derived quantities and the basic physical laws have the\nsame mathematical forms, differing only in the values of the physical\nconstants that appear in them.\nIn the first type of system illustrated in the table, length, time and mass\nare base quantities and the force unit is measured in terms of mass and\nacceleration via Newton's law in the form F=ma. The SI and the cgs\n\n(centimeter, gram, second) systems are in this category. In the second\ntype, length, time and force are base, and mass is measured via F=ma. An\nexample is the British Gravitational System, in which the base units are\nthe foot, the second and the pound-force (lbf). The pound-force is the\nforce exerted by standard gravity (32.2 ft/s2) on a standard mass sample,\nthe pound-mass (hence the term \"gravitational system\"). Mass in this\nTable 2.2: Dimensions of some mechanical quantities in different\ntypes of systems of units\nBase quantities and their dimensions in three types of system of units\nType 1\nType 2\nType 3\nBase quantities & dimensions\nL, M, t\nL, F, t\nL, M, F, t\nDimensions of some derived quantities\nvelocity = dx/dt\nLt-1\nLt-1\nLt-1\nacceleration = d2x/dt2\nLt-2\nLt-2\nLt-2\nmass\nM\nFt2L-1\nM\narea=∫dxdy\nL2\nL2\nL2\nforce\nMLt-2\nF\nF\nc=F/ma in Newton's law\nc=l\nc=l\nFM-1L-1t2\nwork = ∫Fdx\nML2t-2\nFL\nFL\nstress = F/A\nML-1t-2\nFL-2\nFL-2\nviscosity=τ/(∂u/∂y)\nML-1t-1\nFL-2t\nFL-2t\nsystem is a derived quantity with dimension Ft2L-1 and a unit (the \"slug\")\nwhich turns out to be g=32.2 times as large as the pound-mass. In the third\ntype, length, time, mass, and force are taken as base quantities, and\nNewton's law reads F=cma, where c is a physical constant with dimension\nFt2M-1L-1. The British Engineering System is an example. In this system\n\nthe base units taken are the foot, the second, the pound-mass (lbm), and\nthe pound-force (lbf), and the constant in Newton's law has the value\nc=1/32.2 lbf s2 lbm-1 ft-1.\nTable 2.2 illustrates the fact that, while an actual physical quantity like\nforce is the same regardless of the (arbitrary) choice of the system of units,\nits dimension depends on that choice. What is more, depending on how\nderived quantities are defined, a given physical law may contain a\ndimensional physical constant the value of which must be specified (as in\nF=cma), or it may contain no physical constant (as in F=ma).\nAn interesting point to note is that only a few of the available universal\nlaws are usually \"used up\" to make base quantities into derived ones of the\nsecond kind. There are many laws left with universal dimensional physical\nconstants that could in principle be set equal to unity: the gravitational\nconstant G, Planck's constant h, Boltzmann's constant kB, the speed of light\nin vacuum c, etc. This leaves us with some interesting possibilities. For\nexample, it is possible to define systems of units that have no base\nquantities at all (see Bridgman, 1931). In such systems all units of\nmeasurement are related to some of the universal constants that describe\nour universe. In effect, there exist in the universe \"natural\" units for all\nbase quantities, based on universal constants such as the speed of light, the\nquantum of energy, etc. Unfortunately, the choice of such \"natural\"\nsystems of units turns out to be far from unique, which renders futile any\nattempt to endow any one of them with unique significance.\n2.8 Recapitulation\n1. A base quantity is a property that is defined in physical terms by\ntwo operations: a comparison operation, and an addition operation. The\ncomparison operation is a physical procedure for establishing whether two\nsamples of the quantity are equal or unequal; the addition operation\ndefines what is meant by the sum of two samples of that property.\n2. Base quantities are properties for which the following concepts are\ndefined in terms of physical operations: equality, addition, subtraction,\nmultiplication by a pure number, and division by a pure number. Not\ndefined in terms of physical operations are: product, ratio, power, and\nlogarithmic, exponential, trigonometric and other special functions of\nphysical quantities.\n\n3. A base quantity can be measured in terms of an arbitrarily chosen\nunit of its own kind and a numerical value.\n4. A derived quantity of the first kind is a product of various powers of\nnumerical values of base quantities. A derived quantity is defined in terms\nof numerical value (which depends on base unit size) and does not\nnecessarily have a tangible physical representation.\n5. The dimension of any physical quantity, whether base or derived, is\na formula that defines how the numerical value of the quantity changes\nwhen the base unit sizes are changed. The dimension of a quantity does\nnot by itself provide any information on the quantity's intrinsic nature. The\nsame quantity (e.g. force) may have different dimensions in different\nsystems of units, and quantities that are clearly physically different (e.g.\nwork and torque) may have the same dimension.\n6. Relationships between physical quantities may be represented by\nmathematical\nrelationships\nbetween\ntheir\nnumerical\nvalues.\nA\nmathematical equation that correctly describes a physical relationship\nbetween quantities is dimensionally homogeneous (see section 2.5). Such\nequations remain valid when base unit sizes are changed arbitrarily.\n7. The categorization of physical quantities as either base or derived is\nto some extent arbitrary. If a particular base quantity turns out to be\nuniquely related to some other base quantities via some universal law, then\nwe can, if we so desire, use the law to redefine that quantity as a derived\nquantity of the second kind whose magnitude depends on the units chosen\nfor the others. All base quantities that are transformed into derived\nquantities in this way retain their original physical identities (i.e. their\ncomparison and addition operations), but their numerical values are\nmeasured in terms of the remaining base quantities, either directly via a\ndefining equation or indirectly by using a unit that is derivable from the\nremaining base units.\n8. A system of units is defined by (a) the base quantities, (b) their\nunits, and (c) the derived quantities, each with either its defining equation\nor the form of the physical law that has been used to cast the quantity into\nthe derived category. Both the type and the number of base quantities are\nopen to choice.\n\n3. Dimensional Analysis\nThis chapter introduces the procedure of dimensional analysis and\ndescribes Buckingham's π-theorem, which follows from it. Section 3.1\nlays down the procedure in general terms and defines the vocabulary.\nSection 3.2 gives an example, which the reader may wish to read in\nparallel with section 3.1 step by step. Section 3.3 discusses the utility of\ndimensional analysis and some of the pitfalls and questions that arise in its\napplication to real problems.\n3.1 The steps of dimensional analysis and Buckingham's\n-theorem\nThe premise of dimensional analysis is that the form of any physically\nsignificant equation must be such that the relationship between the actual\nphysical quantities remains valid independent the magnitudes of the base\nunits. Dimensional analysis derives the logical consequences of this\npremise.\nSuppose we are interested in some particular physical quantity Q0 that\nis a \"dependent variable\" in a well defined physical process or event. By\nthis we mean that, once all the quantities that define the particular process\nor event are specified, the value of Q0 follows uniquely.\nStep 1: The independent variables\nThe first and most important step in dimensional analysis is to identify a\ncomplete set of independent quantities Q1...Qn that determine the value of\nQ0,\nQ0 = f(Q1, Q2, ... , Qn).\n(3.1)\nA set Q1...Qn is complete if, once the values of the members are specified,\nno other quantity can affect the value of Q0, and independent if the value\nof each member can be adjusted arbitrarily without affecting the value of\nany other member.\nStarting with a correct set Q1...Qn is as important in dimensional\nanalysis as it is in mathematical physics to start with the correct\nfundamental equations and boundary conditions. If the starting point is\n\nwrong, so is the answer. We defer to section 3.2 the question of how a\ncorrect set is to be identified.\nThe relationship expressed symbolically in equation (3.1) is the result\nof the physical laws that govern the phenomenon of interest. It is our\npremise that its form must be such that, once the values Q1...Qn are\nspecified, the equality holds regardless of the sizes of the base units in\nterms of which the quantities are measured. The steps that follow derive\nthe consequences of this premise.\nStep 2: Dimensional considerations\nNext we list the dimensions of the dependent variable Q0 and the\nindependent variables Q1...Qn. As we have discussed, the dimension of a\nquantity depends on the type of system of units (see table 2.2), and we\nmust specify at least the type the system of units before we do this. For\nexample, if we use a system of type 1 in table 2.2 and are dealing with a\npurely mechanical problem, all quantities have dimensions of the form\n[Qi ] = L\nli M\nmit\ni\n(3.2)\nwhere the exponents li, mi and\nare dimensionless numbers that follow\ni\nfrom each quantity's definition.\nWe now pick from the complete set of physically independent\nvariables Q1...Qn a complete, dimensionally independent subset Q1...Qk\n(k n), and express the dimension of each of the remaining independent\nvariables Qk+1...Qn and the dependent variable Q0 as a product of powers of\nQ1...Qk. All physical quantities have dimensions which can be expressed\nas products of powers of the set of base dimensions. Alternatively, it is\npossible to express the dimension of one quantity as a product of powers\nof the dimensions of other quantities which are not necessarily base\nquantities. A subset Q1...Qk of the set Q1...Qn is dimensionally independent\nif none of its members has a dimension that can be expressed in terms of\nthe dimensions of the remaining members. And complete if the\ndimensions of all the remaining quantities Qk+1...Qn of the full set can be\nexpressed in terms of the dimensions of the subset Q1...Qk.\nSince equation (3.1) is dimensionally homogeneous, the dimension of\nthe dependent variable Q0 is also expressible in terms of the dimensions of\nQ1...Qk.\n\nThe dimensionally independent subset Q1...Qk is picked by trial and\nerror. Its members may be picked in different ways (see section 3.2), but\nthe number k of dimensionally independent quantities in the full set\nQ1...Qn is unique to the set, and cannot exceed the number of base\ndimensions which appear in the dimensions the quantities in that set. For\nexample, if the dimensions of Q1...Qn involve only length, mass, and time,\nthen k≤3.\nHaving chosen a complete, dimensionally independent subset Q1...Qk,\nwe express the dimensions of Q0 and the remaining quantities Qk+1...Qn in\nterms of the dimensions of Q1...Qk. These will have the form\nNik ]\n[Qi ] = [Q1\nNi 1 Q2\nNi 2 ...Qk\n(3.3)\nif i>k or i=0. The exponents Nij are dimensionless real numbers and can in\nmost cases be found quickly by inspection (see section 3.2), although a\nformal algebraic method can be used.\nThe formal procedure can be illustrated with an example where length,\nmass and time are the only base quantities, in which case all dimensions\nhave the form of equation (3.2). Let us take Q1, Q2, and Q3 as the complete\ndimensionally independent subset. Equating the dimension given by\nequation (3.2) with that of equation (3.3), we obtain three equations\nli = ∑ Nijlj\nj =1\nmi = ∑ Nijm j\n(3.4)\nj =1\nti =∑ Nijtj\nj =1\nwhich can be solved for the three unknowns Ni1, Ni2, and Ni3.\n\nStep 3: Dimensionless variables\nWe now define dimensionless forms of the n-k remaining independent\nvariables by dividing each one with the product of powers of Q1...Qk\nwhich has the same dimension,\nQk +i\nN( k+i ) k ,\n(3.5)\nΠi =\nN(k +i )1 Q2\nN(k +i ) 2...Qk\nQ1\nwhere i=1, 2,..., n-k, and a dimensionless form of the dependent variable\nQ0,\n(3.6)\nΠ0 = Q1\nN01 Q2\nN\nQ\n...Qk\nN 0 k\n.\nStep 4: The end game and Buckingham's -theorem\nAn alternative form of equation (3.1) is\n= f(Q1,Q2, ...., Qk;\n1,\n2 , ...,\nn-k)\n(3.7)\nin which all quantities are dimensionless except Q1...Qk. The values of the\ndimensionless quantities are independent of the sizes of the base units. The\nvalues of Q1...Qk, on the other hand, do depend on base unit size. They\ncannot be put into dimensionless form since they are (by definition)\ndimensionally independent of each other. From the principle that any\nphysically meaningful equation must be dimensionally homogeneous, that\nis, valid independent of the sizes of the base units, it follows that Q1...Qk\nmust in fact be absent from equation (3.7), that is,\n= f( 1,\n2 , ...,\nn-k) .\n(3.8)\nThis equation is the final result of the dimensional analysis, and\ncontains\n\nBuckingham's\n-theorem:\nWhen a complete relationship between dimensional physical\nquantities is expressed in dimensionless form, the number of\nindependent quantities that appear in it is reduced from the original\nn to n-k, where k is the maximum number of the original n that are\ndimensionally independent.\nThe theorem derives its name from Buckingham's use of the symbol\nfor\nthe dimensionless variables in his original 1914 paper. The π-theorem tells\nus that, because all complete physical equations must be dimensionally\nhomogeneous, a restatement of any such equation in an appropriate\ndimensionless form will reduce the number of independent quantities in\nthe problem by k. This can simplify the problem enormously, as will be\nevident from the example that follows.\nThe π-theorem itself merely tells us the number of dimensionless\nquantities that affect the value of a particular dimensionless dependent\nvariable. It does not tell us the forms of the dimensionless variables. That\nhas to be discovered in the third and fourth steps described above. Nor\ndoes the π-theorem, or for that matter dimensional analysis as such, say\nanything about the form of the functional relationship expressed by\nequation (3.7). That form has to be discovered by experimentation or by\nsolving the problem theoretically.\n3.2 An example: Deformation of an elastic ball striking a wall\nSuppose we wish to investigate the deformation that occurs in elastic balls\nwhen they impact on a wall. We might be interested, for example, in\nfinding out what determines the diameter d of the circular imprint left on\nthe wall after a freshly dyed ball has rebounded from it (figure 3.1).\nStep 1: The independent variables\nThe first step is to identify a complete set of independent quantities that\ndetermine the imprint radius d. We begin by specifying the problem more\nclearly. We agree to restrict our attention to (initially) spherical,\nhomogeneous balls made of perfectly elastic material, to impacts at\nperpendicular to the wall, and to walls that are perfectly smooth and flat\n\nand so stiff and heavy that they do not deform or move during the impact\nprocess. We also agree to adopt a system of units of type 1 in table 2.2,\nlike the SI system.\nFig. 3.1: A freshly dyed elastic ball leaving imprint after impact with rigid wall.\nThe numerical value of a dependent variable like d will be depend on\nthe values of all quantities that distinguish one impact event from another.\nExperience suggests that these should include at least the following: the\nball's diameter D and velocity V just prior to contact (the initial\nconditions) and its mass m. The ball's intrinsic material properties will\nalso play a role. Our theoretical understanding of solid mechanics tells us\nthat the quasi-static response of a perfectly elastic material is characterized\nby two material properties, the modulus of elasticity E and Poisson's ratio\n, and that the inertial effects which inevitably come into play during\ncollision and rebound will also depend on the material's density . The\nproperties of the wall are irrelevant if it is indeed perfectly rigid, as we\nassumed. We know, however, by thinking of how the problem would have\nto be set up as a theoretical one, that the answer for the numerical value d\nwill also depend on the values of all universal constants that appear in the\nphysical laws that control the ball's impact dynamics. In this case the\nprocess is governed by Newton's law of motion and the law of mass\nconservation. Having chosen a system of units of type 1 in table 2.2, we\nknow that Newton's law has the form F=ma and contains no universal\n\nconstants8. Nor are there any physical constants in the law of mass\nconservation.\nWe seem to arrive at the conclusion that d depends on six quantities:\nD, V, m, E,\n. This is a complete set, as required, but not an independent\nset: once the ball's mass and diameter are specified, its density follows.\nWe must therefore exclude either the density or the mass. (Other quantities\nlike V2 , DE1/2, etcetera, all involving quantities that affect the value of d,\nare excluded for the same reason: they are not independent of the\nquantities already included.) We conclude that the following relationship\nexpresses the impact diameter in terms of a complete set of independent\nvariables:\nd = d(V,\n(3.9)\n, D, E, ).\nNote that the choice of a complete, independent set for a specified\nproblem is not unique except for the number n of its members (n=5 in this\ncase). One could just as well have chosen V2, , D, E, and\nD, E,\n, say, or V, m,\n--see section 3.3. It should also be noted that further assumptions\nhave been taken for granted in equation (3.9). We have presumed, for\nexample, that the ball's motion is unaffected by the properties of the fluid\nthrough which it approaches the wall (which is certainly OK if the ball\nmoves through vacuum and a good approximation in air, but may not\napply to small balls in viscous liquids), and that gravitational effects play a\nnegligible role. See the discussion in section 3.3.\nStep 2: Dimensional considerations\nIn the type of system of units we have adopted in step 1, the\ndimensions of the quantities in equation (3.9) are:\nindependent:\n[V]=Lt-1\n[ ]=ML-3\n[D]=L\n(3.10)\n[E]=ML-1t-2\n[ ]=1\n8 If, on the other hand, we had decided to use a system of type 3 in Table 2.1, the value of\nthe dimensional constant c=F/ma for the chosen system of units would have to be\nspecified, and would affect the value of d.\n\ndependent:\n[d]=L\nInspection of the above shows that the three quantities V, , and D, for\nexample, comprise a complete, dimensionally independent subset of the\nfive independent variables. The dimension of any one of these three\ncannot be made up of the dimensions of the other two. The dimensions of\nthe remaining independent variables E and and the dependent variable d\ncan, however, be made up of those of V, and D as follows:\n-2\nindependent:\n[E] = ML\n-1t\n= (ML\n-3)(Lt)\n2 = [ V\n2]\n[ ] = 1\n(3.11)\ndependent:\n[d] = L = [D]\nWe have written down these results very simply by inspection.\nAccomplished practitioners seldom use the formal algebraic method of\nsection 3.1. Note again that the dimension of a dimensionless quantity like\nis unity, the factor by which dimensionless numbers change when the\nsizes of the base units are changed.\nStep 3: Dimensionless similarity parameters\nWe non-dimensionalize the remaining independent variables E and and\nthe dependent variable d by dividing them by\nV\n2, D, and unity,\nrespectively, as suggested by equation (3.11):\nED3\nindependent:\nΠ1 = mV\nΠ2 =\n(3.12)\ndependent:\nΠ0 = d\nD\n\nStep 4: The end game\nUsing the logic that led to Buckingham's π-theorem, we now conclude\nthat\nΠ = f (Π1,Π2),\no\nor\nd\n⎛ E\n⎞⎟ .\n(3.13)\n= f ⎜\nV\n2 , ⎠\nD\n⎝\nThe number of independent variables has been reduced from the original\nn=5 that define the problem to n-k =2.\n3.3 On the utility of dimensional analysis, and some difficulties and\nquestions that arise in its application\nSimilarity\nDimensional analysis provides a similarity law for the phenomenon under\nconsideration. Similarity in this context implies a certain equivalence\nbetween two physical phenomena that are actually different. The collisions\nof two different elastic spheres 1 and 2 with a rigid wall, each with its own\nvalues of V, , D, E, and\nunder particular conditions where the parameters of the two events are\nsuch that\n, may appear to be quite different. However,\n1 and\n2 have the same values, that is, where\nE1\nE2\n=\n2V2\n1V1\n(3.14)\n2 =\n1,\nequation (3.13) informs us that\n0 has the same value in both cases, that\nis,\nd1\nd2 =\n.\n(3.15)\nD2\nD1\n\nWhen the relationships in equation (3.14) apply, the two dynamic events\nare similar in the sense of equation (3.15).\nOut-of-scale modeling\nScale modeling deals with the following question: If we want to learn\nsomething about the performance of a full-scale system 1 by testing a\ngeometrically similar small-scale system model 2 (or vice-versa, if the\nsystem of interest inaccessibly small), at what conditions should we test\nthe model, and how should we obtain the full-scale performance from\nmeasurements at the small scale? Dimensional analysis provides the\nanswer.\nSuppose we need to know the deformation diameter of a huge, soft\nrubber ball with a diameter D of 5 meters and properties E1,\nand , as\n,\nit hits the pavement with a speed V2 of 10 m/s, but are unable to compute it\nfrom basic principles. In that case we need only perform one small-scale\ntest with a model 2 of diameter D2, selecting its properties and test\nconditions such that equations (3.14) are satisfied, and measure its imprint\ndiameter d2. The full-scale value d1 of the big ball's imprint diameter at its\n\"design conditions\" can then be obtained from equation (3.15).\nDimensional analysis reduces the number of variables and minimizes\nwork\nDimensional analysis reduces the number of variables that must be\nspecified to describe an event. This often leads to an enormous\nsimplification. In our example of the impacting ball the answer depends on\nfive independent variables (equation 3.9), that is, a particular event may be\nrepresented as a distribution of d defined in a five-dimensional space of\nindependent variables. Suppose we set out to obtain the answer in a certain\nregion (a certain volume) of this variable-space, by either computation or\nexperimentation, and decide that 10 data points will be required in each\nvariable, with the other four being held constant. This would require\nobtaining 105 data points. Dimensional analysis, however, shows us that in\ndimensionless form the answer depends only on two similarity parameters.\nThis two-dimensional space can be explored with similar resolution with\nonly 102 data points, that is, with 0.1% of the effort.\n\nFigure 3.2: Experimental data of d/D vs E/ρV2 for γ=0.3 and γ=0.5.\nFigure 3.2: Plot of \"experimental data\" in dimensionless form.\nTable 3.1 shows some \"experimental data\" for impacts with balls of\nthree materials and various values of impact velocity.

Disregarding the\nscatter, all points fall essentially on a common curve, as predicted by\ndimensional analysis. The influence of the Poisson's ratio turns out to be\nvirtually negligible, given the scatter, and all the data may be curve-fitted\nV\nwith an equation of the form d / D = f (E /\n).\nAn incomplete set of independent quantities may destroy the analysis\nAssuming competence on the part of the analyst, the correctness of the\ndimensional analysis will depend entirely on whether a complete set of\nindependent quantities Q1...Qn is in fact properly identified in step 1. Any\ncomplete set will yield correct results. If, however, the analysis is based on\na set which omits even one independent quantity that affects the value of\nQo, dimensional analysis will give erroneous results.\nSuppose that in our example we had omitted the sphere's modulus of\nelasticity E in equation (3.9). Instead of equation (3.13), we would then\nhave obtained the absurd result\nd = f ( ),\n(3.16)\nD\nwhich implies that the maximum deformation depends on the ball's\nPoisson ratio, but is independent of its elasticity, mass and approach\nvelocity! This single error of omission is clearly fatal to the analysis.\nSuperfluous independent quantities complicate the result unnecessarily\nErrors on the side of excess have a less traumatic effect. Over-\nspecification of independent variables does not destroy the analysis, but\nrobs it of its power. For every superfluous independent quantity included\nin the set, there will be in the final dimensionless relationship a\nsuperfluous dimensionless similarity parameter.\nSuppose we argue (quite reasonably!) that the ball's deformation upon\nimpact will in general also depend on the local gravitational acceleration g\n(which we assume to be in the direction into the wall on which the impact\noccurs). This would change equation (3.13) to\n\nd\n⎛ E\ngD⎞\nD = f ⎜\n⎝ V\n2 , ,\n⎟\n(3.17)\nV 2 ⎠\nwhere\ndeformation is in fact insensitive to gravity, as we implicitly assumed\nearlier, equation (3.17) is \"wrong\" only in the sense that it suggests a\ndependence on g that is not noticeably there, and thus unnecessarily\ncomplicates our thinking. If by experimentation or computation we\neventually discover that there exists a broad range of conditions where the\nsimilarity parameter involving g has in fact no measurable effect on d/D,\nand that the conditions of interest fall into this range6, we omit the\nparameter involving g and arrive at the same simpler conclusion as before,\nbut only after due payment in effort for our lack of insight.\n2 is a dimensionless gravity. Under conditions where the\ngD V\nOn the importance of simplifying assumptions\nThe previous example illustrates an important point about most problems\nin dimensional analysis: Completeness in the set of independent variables\nis not an absolute matter, but depends on how we choose to circumscribe\nthe problem. It is quite conceivable, for example, that there are \"balls\"\nwhose deformation upon impact with a wall is gravity-dependent. This\nwould be the case for balls with such low coefficient of elasticity, or large\ndiameter, or low impact velocity, that their deformation at rest on a wall in\nthe gravitational field would be significant compared with their\ndeformation upon impact. When we say \"the deformation does not depend\non gravity\", we imply that we know with some confidence that there exist\nconditions where this is true, and choose to confine our attention to those\nconditions.\nIf dimensional analysis depended on a truly complete identification of\nthe independent variables that specify a given physical event, we would in\nmost cases be reduced to impotence. Those familiar with the theory of\nchaos and the mechanics of many-body systems may sympathize with the\nview that the wind at a certain street corner in New York, say, may in\n6 To prove this with earthbound experimentation one would have to demonstrate that d/D\nremains constant when m, D and/or V are changed so as to vary gD/V2 while keeping\nED3/mV2 constant.\n\nsome measure have been affected by the wing-beat of a butterfly in Brazil\na month earlier. This kind of fastidiousness elicits a shrug from the\npragmatist, who proceeds with a problem by saying: \"Based on my\nexperience as a scientist and engineer, I argue that this event should be\ncontrolled by the following complete set of independent variables.\nAssuming tentatively that I am correct, what does dimensional analysis\ntell me?\"\nOn choosing a complete set of independent variables\nGiven what has been said above, how does one go about choosing a\ncomplete set of independent variables that define a particular problem?\nIf we know the mathematical forms of all the equations and boundary\n(and initial) conditions that completely specify a particular type of process\nor event, one can deduce from them a complete set of independent\nparameters that define the event. This we do by simply examining all the\nequations and listing all the quantities whose values would have to be\nspecified to define a particular event through all time. The set may include\nposition and time, if the variable of interest depends on them, universal\nphysical constants (e.g. gravitational constant, universal gas constant R,\netc.), material properties (e.g. density, E, etc.) and all other quantities that\nappear not only in the equations but also in the boundary and initial\nconditions that determine the answer to the particular problem at hand.\nThe last point is not as straightforward as it sounds: the question of what\nconstitutes a well-posed mathematical problem is often difficult to answer\nin non-linear systems.\nIf the equations and boundary conditions are not well known, as for\nexample when one is trying to use dimensional analysis to help correlate\nexperimental data for a complex phenomenon that is not well understood,\none has to proceed by trial and error based on an (educated) guess about\nthe physics of the problem at hand. Support for the analysis (and thus for\nthe guess about the physics) may be obtained a posteriori by showing that\nall experimental data can indeed be accurately correlated in the\ndimensionless form suggested by the analysis. There should be sufficient\ndata to be able to show that one has neither missed an important quantity\nnor included one that is irrelevant.\n\nThe result is independent of how one chooses a dimensionally independent\nsubset\nSuppose we had chosen the dimensionally independent subset V, E, and\ninstead of V, D and . Non-dimensionalizing d and D with combinations\nof V, E and , we might have obtained the result\nd\n( V\n2 / E)\n1/3 = F\nD\n(mV\n2 / E)\n1 / 3,\n⎛\n⎝\n⎜\n⎞\n⎠\n(3.18)\nThis can, however, be rewritten as\nd\nD = mV2\nED\n⎛\n⎝\n⎜\n⎞\n⎠\n1 / 3\nF\nED3\nmV\n⎛\n⎝\n⎜\n⎞\n⎠\n1 / 3\n,\n⎛\n⎝\n⎜\n⎞\n⎠\n⎟ = f ED3\nmV\n2 ,\n⎛\n⎝\n⎜\n⎞\n⎠\n(3.19)\nwhere F and f are different functions of their arguments. Equation (3.19) is\nof course identical to equation (3.13).\nThe result is independent of the type of system of units\nThe choice of system of units may affect the dimensions of physical\nquantities as well as the values of the physical constants that appear in the\nunderlying physical laws. What effect, if any, does this have on\ndimensional analysis? Reason dictates there should be no effect on the\n\"bottom line\", since the observer (the analyst) is free to choose or make up\nwhatever system of units he wants, and his arbitrary choice should not\naffect the laws of physics.\nConsider our example of the dyed ball, but viewed in terms of a\nsystem of units like the British Engineering System (type3 in table 2.2),\nwhere mass, length, time and force are taken as base units. In such a\nsystem Newton's law reads F= cma, where c is a physical constant with\ndimension Ft2m-1 L-1. This affects the very first step of the analysis. Since\nthe impact process is controlled by Newton's law, which now contains the\nconstant c, the value of which must be specified, we now have\nd = d(V ,D, E,m, ,c).\n(3.20)\n\nThe number of independent variable (n=6) has increased by one. The\ndimensions of the variable are now:\nindependent:\n[V]=Lt-1\n[D]=L\n[E]=FL-2\n(3.21)\n[m]=M\n[ ]=0\n[c]=Ft2M-1L-1\ndependent:\n[d]=L\nThe quantities V, D, m and c comprise a convenient dimensionally\nindependent subset. The number of this subset has also increased by one\n(k=4). The dimensions of the remaining quantities can be expressed in\nterms of these four as\n[d]=[D]\n[E]=[cV2D-3]\n(3.22)\n[ ]=0\nand the final result of the analysis is\nd = f\n⎛⎜ ED\n⎞⎟\n(3.23)\nD\n⎝ cmV 2 , ⎠\nThis differs from our previous result, equation (3.13), only in that the\nphysical constant c appears in the non-dimensionalization of E. Equations\n(3.13) and (3.23) are, however, functionally identical. Since n-k=2 in both\ncases, both analyses imply that d/D depends on two dimensionless\nparameters, and a dimensionless E. It is just that in the second system of\nunits, E must be non-dimensionalized with cmV2/D3 instead of mV2/D3 ,\nsince the latter no longer has the same dimension as E. In short, the forms\nof some of the dimensional parameters may change with the system of\nunits, but the physical content of analysis remains invariant. This is, of\ncourse, as we expected; the choice of system of units is arbitrary, and\nshould not affect the physical \"bottom line.\"\n\n4. Dimensional Analysis in Problems where Some\nIndependent Quantities Have Fixed Values\nEngineering practice often involves problems where some of the quantities\nthat define the problem have the same fixed values in all the applications\nbeing considered. As a simple example, suppose we are interested in\ndetermining the hydrodynamic drag force D on a fully submerged, very\nlong, neutrally buoyant cable being dragged behind a ship, and propose to\ndo this by making small scale experiments in a water tunnel. Basic fluid\nmechanics tells us that, barring surface roughness effects, the drag force\nshould be completely determined by the cable's length L and diameter d,\nthe ship's (or water's) velocity V, and the water's density\nand viscosity\n. Three of these five quantities are dimensionally independent, and\ndimensional analysis (or Buckingham's pi-theorem) tells us that an\nappropriately defined dimensionless drag is a function of n-k=2\ndimensionless similarity parameters. One way of writing this relationship\nis\nD\nV 2L2 = f Re, d\nL\n⎛\n⎝\n⎞\n⎠\n(4.1)\nwhere\nRe = VL\n4.2)\nis a Reynolds number based on cable length and d/L is the cable's\n\"fineness coefficient,\" which defines its geometry. Equation (4.1) is a\ngeneral relationship for the cable-towing problem as stated.\nWe observe, however, that the density and viscosity have essentially\nthe same values⎯those of sea water at its typical temperature⎯in all the\napplications that are of interest. The number of quantities that actually\nvary from case to case are thus actually three, not five.\nThe question arises, does this lead to a simplification of the similarity\nlaw expressed by equation (4.1), that is, to a reduction in the number of\nindependent similarity parameters? Simply omitting the quantities that\nhave fixed values and performing dimensional analysis on the rest cannot\n\nanswer this question9. Dimensional analysis must be based on a complete\nset of independent quantities that determine the quantity of interest. All the\nquantities whose values determine the quantity of interest must be\nincluded, regardless of whether some of them happen to be the same\nvalues in the problems that are of interest. As we have seen in section 3,\nomitting even one independent variable can fatally damage the analysis.\nThe general question is the following: What reduction, if any, can be\nobtained in the number of similarity parameters if a certain number of the\nindependent quantities that define the problem always have the same fixed\nvalues? This can be answered by the following analysis.\nSuppose we are interested in a quantity Q that is completely\ndetermined by the values of n independent quantities Qi, of which nF are\nheld at fixed values in all the cases that concern us. Let the quantities that\nmay vary be the first (n-nF) of Qi, and designate the nF quantities with\nfixed values by Fi:\nQ = f (Q1,Q2,..,Qn- nF ;F1,F2,..,FkF ,FkF +1,FkF +2,.., F )\n(4.3)\nnF\nChoose a complete, dimensionally independent subset of the set Fi. Let\nthese be the first kF of the fixed set, as indicated in equation (4.3). Using\nthis subset, non-dimensionalize the remaining (nF-kF) fixed quantities and\nwrite the relationship (4.3) in the alternative form\n∗\n∗\n∗\nQ = f (Q1,Q2,...,Qn- nF ;F1,F2,...,FkF ,F ,F ,..., FnF )\n(4.4)\nk+1\nk +1\nwhere the asterisked indicate dimensionless quantities involving only\nquantities with fixed values. These dimensionless quantities thus have the\nsame fixed values in the cases that concern us. For these cases, therefore,\nwe can write (4.4) as\nQ = f (Q1,Q2,...,Qn- nF ;F1,F2,...,FkF )\n(4.5)\nThe value of Q is thus completely determined by a set of n-nF+kF\nindependent quantities consisting of those dependent quantities that are\n9 Were we to simply omit the density and viscosity in the present problem, for example,\nwe would imply a relationship D=f(L,h,V) which is not dimensionally homogeneous and\ntherefore unacceptable. (There is no way of writing the dimension of force in terms of\njust length and velocity).\n\nnot fixed plus the dimensionally independent subset of the fixed\nquantities.\nNow perform dimensional analysis on the relationship in equation\n(4.5). First, select from the set of n-nF+kF independent quantities in\nequation (4.5) a complete, dimensionally independent subset of k\nquantities. Let this subset be the first k of the quantities. Since equation\n(4.5) contains all the variable independent quantities plus the\ndimensionally independent subset of the fixed (independent) quantities,\nthe subset we thus obtain is also complete, dimensionally independent\nsubset for the whole original set of n quantities.\nAccording to equation (4.5), Q depends on n-nF+kF independent\nvariables, of which k are independent. Dimensional analysis thus yields\nthe result\n∗\nQ = f (Π1,Π2,...,ΠN )\n(4.6)\nwhere\nN = (n - k) - (nF - kF ) .\n(4.7)\nWe have arrived at the following theorem:\nTheorem\nIf a quantity Q is completely determined by a set of n\nindependent quantities, of which k are dimensionally\nindependent, and if nF of these quantities have fixed values in\nall the cases being considered, a number kF of these being\ndimensionally independent, then a suitable dimensionless Q\nwill be completely determined by (n-k)-(nF-kF) dimensionless\nsimilarity parameters.\nIn other words, the fact that a number nF of the quantities always have\nfixed values reduces the number of independent similarity parameters by\n(nF-kF). This theorem is a generalization of Buckingham's\n-theorem, and\nreduces to it when nF=0.\nReturning to the cable-towing example, in which nF=2 and kF=2, we\nnow see immediately that no gain in similarity (no reduction in the number\nof similarity parameters) accrues from the fact that the viscosity and\n\ndensity are essentially the same in all the applications that interest us. The\nsimilarity law equation (4.1) cannot be simplified.\nSimplification occurs only when some of the fixed quantities are\ndimensionally dependent on the rest.\n\nCited References\nBarenblatt, G.

      "content": "Chapter 1\nTime Dependent Mechanical\nBehavior of Hydrated Biological\nTissues\n1.1\nSwelling and Deformational Behavior of\nTissues: Experimental Observations\nCharacterization of the swelling of hydrated tissues is often a critical link in under\nstanding the role of individual molecular constituents in the tissue's overall structure\nand mechanical behavior. Measurement of the kinetics of swelling can also help\nto delineate the mechanisms and rate-limiting processes that relate molecular level\nstructure to macro-continuum biomechanics of tissues.\nIt is known that enthalpic and entropic effects, long-range electrostatic forces,\nas well as specific intra- and intermolecular crosslinkages, are among the interactions\nthat can significantly affect the rheological behavior of biological tissues. For exam\nple, proteoglycans (PG) and their ionized glycosaminoglycan (GAG) constituents are\nprimarily responsible for the osmotic swelling pressures of connective tissues at phys\niological pH. This swelling is crucial to the tissue's ability to withstand compressive\nmechanical loads in vivo. Urban et al1 have pointed out that PG concentrations are\nhigher in cartilagenous tissues than other connective tissues: PG account for ∼5% of\nthe net wet weight in human femoral head cartilage and higher in the nucleus of the\ndisc, compared to ∼0.1 - 1% in tendon and the loose connective tissue of umbilical\ncord (Wharton's jelly). Therefore, cartilagenous tissue would be expected to have a\n1Urban, J.P.G., Maroudas, A., Bayliss, M.T., and Dillin, J., Biorheology, 16, 447, 1979.\n\nCHAPTER 1. TIME DEPENDENT TISSUE BEHAVIOR\nhigher osmotic swelling pressure. However, when excised specimens of articular carti\nlage, disc, and umbilical cord are placed in identical physiological saline, the cartilage\nswells by only 1-2%,2 the disc may swell by 100% (annulus) to 250% (nucleus)2 and\nnative umbilical cord strips may well swell 50-100% beyond their in vivo wet weight.\nThus, it is apparent that the content of fixed charge groups alone is only one of many\nfactors that controls tissue swelling. The size and arrangement of collagen fibrils,\nchemical crosslinkages, mechanical entanglements, and other factors all play a role in\ndetermining the ultrastructure and equilibrium volume of a given tissue.\n1.1.1\nMeasurement of Non-Equilibrium Tissue Volumetric\nChanges\nWhile measurement of equilibrium hydration of tissues can lead to significant insight\ninto tissue ultrastructure, non-equilibrium experiments and models are essential to\nthe understanding of the mechanism of tissue volumetric changes and the chemical,\nmechanical and electromechanical rate processes that may govern transient tissue de\nformations. Such experiments have led to new information regarding the interaction\nbetween macromolecular constituents within a tissue. Non-equilibrium swelling be\nhavior has been studied extensively in cornea,3,4,5 tendon and reconstituted collagen\nfibers,6,7, and many other tissues.\nWhen the bath composition (e.g., ion concentrations, pH, etc.) of a specimen\nis altered, several nonequilibrium rate processes may occur simultaneously. The ki\nnetics of each rate process can be approximated by a time constant associated with\na linearized model. Important rate processes and their associated time constants\ninclude:\n1. Diffusion of mobile ions within the matrix: τdiff ∼ δ2/Di; Chemical diffusion ki\nnetics can be characterized by a time constant proportional to the square of the\nspecimen thickness δ and inversely proportional to ion diffusivity Di. 8 .\n2.

Readjustment of local (double layer) electric fields and forces: τch.rel.\n2/σ;\n∼\nReadjustment of local electric fields within the matrix, after an instantaneous\nchange in the ionic content of the interstitial fluid, is proportional to the ratio\nof the interstitial fluid permittivity 2 to its conductivity σ. 10 τch.rel. varies from\n∼ 10-5 - 10-6 sec in bone,11 with its relatively low fluid content, to 10-9 sec in\ntendon24 and cartilage.8 Charge relaxation times are so short that this process\nwill never be rate-limiting for swelling of macroscopic tissues having dimensions\nδ much greater than a Debye length (∼ 1nm)!\n4. Mechanical readjustment (swelling) of the tissue matrix: τmatrix ∼ δ2/(Hk);\nThis process involves elastic reconfiguration of the matrix molecules simultane\nously with relative fluid flow into or out of the matrix. The mechanical swelling\nof polymer gels12 and connective tissues such as cartilage13 and cornea14 has\nbeen described in the small strain limit by a time constant proportional to the\nhydraulic permeability k and the elastic modulus H (tensile, compressive, etc.)\nof the matrix. When the intrinsic viscoelastic behavior of the solid matrix is\nimportant, yet another time constant would be appropriate.\n5. Electrodiffusion: τed ≡ τdiff [1 + (Eoδ/2πVT )2]-1; When an electric field Eo is\napplied across a tissue or a membrane of thickness δ, τed is the time needed for\nthe establishment of a new equilibrium profile of mobile ion concentration within\nthe tissue15 . The new concentration profile represents a competition between\nion migration through an applied voltage drop Eoδ and ion diffusion represented\nby the \"thermal voltage\" VT ≡ RT /F (assuming no binding reactions occur).\nA comparison of the magnitudes of the above time constants can give valuable\ninsight into the mechanism that controls swelling in different tissues. Based upon\npublished experimental data and theoretical observations, The major conclusions are:\n1. In relatively high modulus, soft connective tissues such as tendon and carti\nlage it has been discovered that τmatrix ¿ τdiff .

TIME DEPENDENT TISSUE BEHAVIOR\nosmotic swelling (deswelling) induced by changes in bath neutral salt concen\ntration occurs at least as rapidly as chemical diffusion. It was concluded that\nsalt diffusion appeared to be the rate-limiting mechanism for swelling in such\nexperiments.\n2. In connective tissues with a lower modulus (e.g corneal stroma) and/or lower\npermeability, measurements have shown that Hk ¿ Di (τdiff ¿ τmatrix)18,19,20,21 .\nThe same would be expected for the nucleus of the disc, although this author\nhas not yet seen such data. For tissues in which τdiff ¿ τmatrix, changes in\nexternal bath concentration will chemically equilibrate with the interstitial fluid\nmuch faster than subsequent mechanical swelling (deswelling). In such cases,\nthe observed swelling kinetics provides a direct measure of the product of the\ntissue's elastic modulus and hydraulic permeability, as long as solid phase matrix\nviscoelasticity is not important.\n3. Conversely, for tissues in which τmatrix ¿ τdiff , free swelling kinetics are dom\ninated by chemical processes (i.e. the slowest, rate-limiting process). In such\ncases, the measured swelling kinetics may be invaluable as a quantitative, non\ndestructive measure of certain biochemical properties, such as diffusion-limited\nbinding (τdr) of Ca++ and other ions to connective tissues.\n4. The kinetics of swelling brought about by electrodiffusion-induced changes in\nintra-tissue salt concentration should be governed by τed as long as τmatrix ¿ τed.\nThis was recently demonstrated with collagen membranes: a sinusoidal trans\nmembrane field produced sinusoidal changes in isometric stress whose frequency\nresponse correlated with electrodiffusion-controlled variations in intramembrane\nNaCl concentration.\nA final caution concerning swelling experiments is necessary.\nProlonged\nswelling of connective tissues may lead to proteoglycan loss and other degeneration\nprocesses, even when enzymatic inhibitors are used. A micrograph of corneal stroma\nwith edema (Chapter 1.4) shows an even more drastic matrix degradation. For tissues\nsuch as disc, cornea and umbilical cord which may undergo large changes in hydration,\nthe measured swelling kinetics may be dominated by artifactual tissue breakdown. In\nsuch cases, the H and k predicted from such data would have little meaning.\n1.2\nLinear Poroelastic Behavior of Tissues:\nTheories and Experiments\nWe have seen that the nonequilibirum rheological behavior of biological tissues is the\nresult of complex interactions involving both the interstitial fluid and the extracel\n\n1.2. LINEAR POROELASTIC BEHAVIOR\nlular solid matrix constituents. In some cases, single phase viscoelastic models (e.g.,\nlumped parameter spring/dashpot models) may be able to characterize tissue me\nchanics within limited ranges of stress, strain, and time (frequency). For example,\ncyclic testing of tendons and ligaments in tension has been described by the quasi-\nlinear viscoelastic theory of Fung [Woo et al., 1981, Y.C. Fung, 1982]. Tensile testing\nof connective tissues is sometimes dominated by the solid collagen fiber constituents\nand, therefore, flow of water may be somewhat less important. Similarly, the dynamic\nshear behavior of soft tissues may involve little or now flow of interstitial water rel\native to the solid matrix, especially at very small strains. Hence, any \"viscoelastic\"\nbehavior that may be observed may be ascribed to the solid phase of the tissue.\nHowever, the compressional behavior of hydrated soft tissues must necessarily\ninvolve flow of fluid through the extracellular matrix. The resulting frictional inter\nactions between fluid and solid phases lead to the remarkably different rheological\nproperties of such tissues. We will see that the time dependent \"poroelastic\" dis\nplacement profile is no longer uniform when relative fluid flow is important, as was\nassumed for the case of purely solid phase viscoelasticity (see Chapter 1.2). Thus, in\naddition to a temporal phase delay between stress and strain at any point within the\ntissue, there is also a spatial phase delay between the displacement from one point in\nthe tissue to the next. That is, the displacement profile within the tissue is found,\nin general, to be described by the solution to a partial differential equation in space\nand time.\nVarious poroelastic and mixture theories have been successfully applied to\ndescribe the deformational behavior of soft connective tissues, gels, geophysical ma\nterials, soils, and other materials composed of a multiple of fluid and solid phases.\nThe following discussion will focus on the fundamental laws that can be combined to\nformulate a general model for the mechanical and electromechanical behavior of soft\ntissues. In addition, the influence of the chemical environment on the stress-strain\nand material properties of such tissues will be included. For simplicity, we focus\non isotropic, homogeneous, linear material behavior and, to exemplify a class of ap\nproaches, utilize a simple poroelastic approach similar to that of Biot and coworkers.\n1.2.1\nEquillibrium Total Stress Constitutive Relation\nIn many tissues, there are distinct molecular constituents that are separately respon\nsible for different components of the total swelling stress. For example, in articular\ncartilage at physiological pH, it is accepted that the repulsive interactions between the\ncharge groups of the proteoglycan aggregates provide the positive swelling force, while\nthe elastic recoil of the stretched collagen fibrous network maintains tissue integrity\n(Maroudas, 1979). In what follows, we develop a constitutive relation for the total\n\nCHAPTER 1. TIME DEPENDENT TISSUE BEHAVIOR\nswelling stress. Experiments will also be described that characterize the contribution\nof electrical forces to the material properties that make up this constitutive relation.\nIn general, the total swelling stress is made up of several components that\nresult from distinct physical interactions (Flory, 1953), including:\n1. a component due to stretching of the marcomolecular chains comprising the in\nterconnected solid matrix. This component opposes swelling and its magnitude\nincreases as swelling increases.\n2. a component due to electrostatic (Donnan osmotic) interactions. This com\nponent can be interpreted at the molecular level as the result of double layer\nrepulsive forces between charged constituents of the tissue. Alternatively, at\nthe macro-continuum level, this component can be interpreted as an osmotic\npressure resulting from the increased concentration of counterions that must be\npresent in the tissue to preserve electroneutrality. These are one and the same\nphenomena. The magnitude of this component of the swelling stress decreases\nwith increased swelling, increased external ion concentrations, or decreased fixed\ncharge density.\n3. a component due to interactions between the matrix macromolecules and the\nsolvent. This component accounts for the affinity between the matrix and the\nsolvent. For \"good\" solvents, the matrix tends to imbibe fluid and increase\nswelling. Similarly, the matrix tends to resist swelling in \"poor\" solvents.\n4. a component due to the thermal motion of the matrix macromolecular segments,\noften referred to as polymer excluded volume effects. This component tends to\nswell the network, and its magnitude decreases as swelling increases.\nIn developing a constitutive law for total stress, we will include on tissue\nswelling behavior that is mediated by electrical interactions between the charged\nconstituents of the solid tissue matrix. Changing ion concentrations in the tissue\nbathing solution alters the electrical repulsive forces between these constitutents by\nchanging the electrical interaction distance (Debye length) within the tissue. In an\nexperiment in which the deformation is held constant, the altered electrical repulsive\nforces give rise to a change in swelling stress and a concomitant change in the measured\nstress required to keep the deformation constant. Conversely, when the stress on the\ntissue is held constant, a change in salt concentration results in a change in tissue\ndeformation as the charged constituents alter their relative spacing in response to the\nmodified repulsive forces.\nThe total stress Tij for a homogeneous, isotropic linear tissue sample in equi\nlibrium can be expressed by a modified form of the generalized Hooke's law in terms\n\n1.2. LINEAR POROELASTIC BEHAVIOR\nof the strain 2ij , concentration dependent Lame constants G(c) and λ(c) and the\nchemical stress β(c) as\nTij = 2G(c)2ij + {λ(c)2kk - β(c)} δij\n(1)\nwhere the chemical stress β(c) represents the chemical analog of the thermal stress in\nthe thermoelasticity. It is postulated in Eq. (1) that three concentration dependent\nmaterial properties are required to completely describe the chemical modulation of\nswelling behavior for such a homogeneous, isotropic tissue. (To account for tissue\nanisotropy, Eq. (1) must be generalized and β may vary with direction).\nFor the uniaxial confined compression geometry of Figure 8.2.1, Eq. (1) can\nbe written in terms of two concentration dependent material parameters as\nσ = -Tzz = -[2G(c) + λ(c)]2zz + β(c) = H(c)2 + β(c)\n(2)\nwhere H = 2G + λ is the bulk longitudinal modulus (confined compression modulus),\nand the uniaxial stress σ and strain 2(= -2zz ) are defined positive in compression. For\na homogeneous sample in equilibrium at concentration c, a mechanical stress equal\nto the swelling stress p(c, 2) ≡ H(c)2 + β(c) is required to keep the tissue at a given\nthickness in the configuration of Figure 8.2.1.\nThe bulk longitudinal modulus H can be measured at any concentration co by\napplying an increment in compressive stress, Δσ (strain Δ2), as shown in Figure 8.2.2.\nH varies with salt concentration because the resistance of the tissue to deformation\ndepends on the extent of electrical interaction between the charged macromolecules\nthat comprise the solid tissue matrix.\nThe origin of the concentration dependent chemical stress β can be best un\nderstood in the following way. A tissue sample in equilibrium with a bath whose salt\nconcentration is large enough to shield electrical interactions is used to define the\nreference thickness for the sample, as shown in Figure 8.2.3a. When the bath concen\ntration is decreased, electrical repulsive forces between the charged constituents of the\nsolid matrix are increased. When the tissue sample is allowed to swell in the thickness\ndirection, the thickness of the sample increases (Figure 8.2.3b), thereby stretching the\nconstraining chains of the matrix. Equilibrium is reached when the increased electrical\nrepulsive forces are balanced by the constraining force of the stretched network. The\nstress σ required to compress the sample back to its strain free state (Figure 8.2.3c)\nas defined by the reference thickness λref , defines the chemical stress β(c). β is the\nstress that would be measured in equilibrium if the sample was held at its reference\nthickness while the salt concentration was decreased.\n\n1.2. LINEAR POROELASTIC BEHAVIOR\nAn example of show data for the NaCl concentration dependence of H and β,\nmeasured for bovine corneal stroma and articular cartilage is shown in Figure 8.2.4a,b\n(Eisenberg and Grodzinsky, 1985). The modulus of bovine cartilage disks in uniax\nial confined compression was found to be 1.1 MPa at 0.005 M NaCl, 0.55 MPa at\n0.15 M NaCl, and 0.27 MPa at 1.0 M NaCl. The observed decrease in the modulus\nwith increased concentration can be attributed to the electrostatic shielding of the\nproteoglycan charge groups by counterions. The relative insensitivity of H to changes\nin NaCl concentration at the highest concentrations tested suggests that electrostatic\nand Donnan osmotic forces are almost completely shielded in these specimens in 1.0 M\nNaCl. By comparing the modulus at 0.15 M NaCl to the modulus at 1.0 M NaCl it\ncan be concluded that electrostatic repulsive interactions account for at least half of\nthe modulus at physiological ionic strength in bovine articular cartilage.\nThe chemical stress for bovine articular cartilage shows a more rapid decrease\nwith concentration. Here again, the electrostatic shielding effect of increased NaCl\nconcentration results in less stress being required to keep the tissue at its reference\nvolume. The chemical stress is even more important to the swelling behavior of bovine\ncorneal stroma for the strain levels applied in this study, as can be seen by compar\ning the modulus and chemical stress components of corneal swelling stress. This is\nconsistent with the fact that corneal stroma is known to swell for more extensively\nthan articular cartilage (Hedbys and Dohlman, 1963, and Maroudas, 1980).\nBased on Donnan osmotic theory alone, one would expect that changes in the\nelectrostatic contribution to H and β would begin to decrease significantly as the\nconcentration of the bath exceeded the average fixed charge density of the tissue.\n(The charge density of bovine femoropatellar groove cartilage specimens is about -\n0.2 M while that of bovine corneal stroma is - 0.05 M). While the data of Figure 8.2.4\nqualitatively supports this notion, it is apparent that the concentration dependence\nis more complex. The difference in the concentration dependence of H and β for a\ngiven tissue may be the consequence of tissue ultrastructure.\nSimilarly, the marked difference in the material properties H and β of cartilage\nand corneal stroma cannot be interpreted solely on the basis of fixed charge density.\nWhile corneal stroma has about three times fixed charge than articular cartilage,\ncorneal stroma specimens swell far more than cartilage under no load conditions.\nThis due primarily to the differences in the morphology and ultrastructure of the\nextracellular matrix of these tissues. In normal articular cartilage, the tendency of\nthe proteoglycans to hydrate is well constrained by the collagen network. In corneal\nstroma, the proteoglycans help to organize collagen fibrils in a precise parallel array\nwithin each 2 μm thick lamella, but staggered in orientation from one lamella to the\nnext within the ∼ 800μm stroma. The resulting highly organized collagen structure\nhelps to optimize corneal transparency and prevents radial swelling (in the plane\nof the cornea), but allows such significant swelling in the thickness direction that\n\nCHAPTER 1. TIME DEPENDENT TISSUE BEHAVIOR\nan active endothelial cell pump is required in viiivo to express water and thereby\nmaintain normal corneal hydration (Mishima and Kuda, 1967).\n1.2.2\nDarcy's Law for Fluid Flow in Porous Media\nWe assume that the fluid is incompressible and intrinsically inviscid; frictional (vis\ncous) interactions between the fluid and solid matrix in the tissue are described by\nDarcy's Law, which relates the fluid flux to the gradient in total fluid pressure at\nany point within the material. Because the tissue is charged, osmotic (π) as well as\nhydrostatic (P) pressure gradients must be included in Darcy's law. In equilibrium,\nwhen there is no flow anywhere inside the tissue or across the tissue/bath interface,\n(P - π)tissue = (Po - πo), where Po and πo are the hydrostatic and osmotic pressures in\nthe external bath. The hydrostatic pressure Po can be set equal to zero without loss\nof generality (free draining). However, the osmotic pressure πo cannot be set to zero\nfor finite bath concentrations. Because of this asymmetry between the hydrostatic\npressure P and the osmotic pressure π, it is convenient to define the osmotic pressure\ndifference.\nΔπ(z, t) ≡ π(z, t) - πo\n(3)\nWithin the tissue, fluid flow is related to the gradient in the pressure difference\n(P - Δπ) (Katchalsky and Curran, 1965). With the fluid pressure defined as Pf =\n(P - Δπ), the fluid velocity U is related to the gradient in Pf by Darcy's law:\nU = -krPf\n(4)\n\nwhere U is the total area averaged relative flow of fluid with respect to the solid\nand k is the tissue hydraulic permability. Implicit to the fluid flow law of Eq. (4) is\nthat inertial effects are negligible, a reasonable assumption for the known fluid mass\ndensity, time rates of change (frequencies), and frictional damping forces that are of\ninterest. For the case where inertia is important, Darcy's law would be replaced by a\nmore general statement of conservation of momentum for the fluid (for example, see\nFriedman, 1970, 1971).\n\n1.2. LINEAR POROELASTIC BEHAVIOR\n1.2.3\nNonequilibrium Stress-Strain Constitutive Law\nUnder nonequilibrium conditions, a fluid pressure term must be added to Eq. (1) to\naccount for the effect of fluid flow on the total Tij . The total stress Tij can then be\nexpressed as\nTij = 2G(c)2ij + {λ(c)2kk -β(c) -Pf } δij\n(5)\nThis expression is analogous to the general relations given by Rice and Cleary\nand Biot for porous media in the limit of incompressible fluid and solid constituents,\nalthough the chemical stress β and the chemical dependence of the material constants\nG and λ were not included in those developments. The total stress Tij is also equiv\nij of the solid and Tij of the fluid in the mixture model by Mow\nalent to the sum of T s\nf\net al (1980).\nFor the uniaxial confined compression geometry of Figure 8.2.1, Eq. (2) be\ncomes\nσ = HA(c)2 + β(c) + Pf\n(6)\n1.2.4\nConservation of Mass\nConservation of mass for the case of incompressible solid and fluid consitutents takes\nthe form\n= 0\n(7)\nr · vf + αr · vs\nwhere α is the solid volume to liquid volume ration (Vs/Vf ) and vf and vs are the\nlocal (lab frame) velocities of the fluid and solid constituents defined in terms of the\nrelative velocity U and the porosity φ as:\nU = (vf -vs)φ\n(8)\nIn Eqs. (7) and (8), α and φ are related by φ = 1/(1 + α), since porosity is\njust Vf /(Vf + Vs).\nIn the confined uniaxial geometry of Figure 8.2.1, Eq. (7) becomes\n\nCHAPTER 1. TIME DEPENDENT TISSUE BEHAVIOR\n∂U\n∂2\n=\n(9)\n∂z\n∂t\nSince the strain 2 = -∂u/∂z, with solid displacement u related to vs by vs =\n∂u/∂t, Eq. (9) reduces further for the case when fluid is forced to move in only one\ndirection opposite to the motion of the solid. For example, with an impermeable\nbottom surface at z = δ in Figure 8.2.1, compression of the tissue forces fluid to move\nupward such that equation Eq. (9) takes the form U = -∂u/∂t\nIn the absence of inertial effects, conservation of momentum requires that\n∂Tij /∂xj = 0\n(10)\nThis is an excellent approximation for frequencies and strain rates of physio\nlogical interest. In uniaxial geometry, Eq. (10) becomes\n∂σ = 0\n(11)\n∂z\nEqs. (4) and (11) describe the relation between the total stress, fluid flow,\ndisplacement and swelling stress when the material properties are known. When the\nmaterial properties depend on the ionic concentrations, the kinetics of the transition\nin the material properties induced by a change in the concentration of the external\nbath must also be examined in order to describe the evolution of the mechanical\nresponse. This will be described in a later section.\n1.2.5\nSummary\nFor the case of chemically homogeneous systems (no chemical transport or gradients\nin chemical species), Eqs. (4), (6), (9), and (11) constitute a complete description\nof tissue mechanics in terms of the unknowns σ, 2, U, and Pf in the uniaxial geom\netry of Figure 8.2.1. By extension, Eqs. (4), (5), (7), and (10) describe prorelastic\ndeformations and flows in three dimensions. When the material properties (e.g., H,\nk, and β) depend on chemical environment, constitutive laws for the concentration\ndependence must be derived or measured (e.g., Figure 8.2.4).\nIn the next sections, we use the simple poroelastic model outlined above in a\nseries of examples to describe the nonuniform deformation response and the dynamic\n\n1.3. POROELASTIC MEDIA\nmechanical stiffness of hydrated biological tissues. We then extend the model to incor\nporate electrokinetic transduction interactions such as deformation induced streaming\npotentials and electrical current-induced mechanical stress. Finally, we compare some\nexperimental results and theoretical predictions for the manner in which changes in\nionic environment lead to altered tissue stiffness in compression and tension.\n1.3\nHydraulic Permeability, Dynamic Stiffness,\nand Electrokinetic Behavior of Tissues\nModeled as Hydrated Poroelastic Media\n1.3.1\nMacrocontinuum Approaches\nFluid flow and electrokinetic transduction in biological tissues and natural and syn\nthetic membranes have been modeled by non-equilibrium thermodynamic relations\ncast in the lumped parameter form of Eq. (1) or in the continuum form of Eq. (2).\nEq. (1) relates one dimensional fluid and current flows to transmembrane pressure and\npotential drops (see Chapter 1.4), while Eq. (2) applies to the total area-averaged,\none dimensional flows and pressure and potential gradients within the tissue:\n⎡\n⎢⎣\n~n · (~v - ~vm)\n~n · J~0\n⎡\n⎢⎣\n⎤\n⎥⎦ =\nL11 L12\nL21 L22\n⎡\n⎢⎣\n⎤\n⎥⎦\nΔP\nΔV\n⎤\n⎥⎦\n(1)\n∂P\n∂V\nUz (z) = -k11 ∂z + k12 ∂z\n(2)\n∂P\n∂V\nJz (z) = +k21 ∂z - k22 ∂z\nEqs. (1) and (2) apply to systems having negligible chemical concentration\ngradients. The kij of (2) are intrinsic material properties that depend on the electrical,\nmechanical and chemical properties of the tissue matrix. The matrix is assumed\nto be isotropic, but the kij may vary with z for the case of nonuniform material.\nFor homogeneous, isotropic materials the phenomenological coefficients kij and Lij\nare related by the specimen thickness δ: δLij = kij . The electrokinetic coupling\ncoefficients may be modeled in terms of a macrocontinuum fixed charge density, k12 =\n\nCHAPTER 1. TIME DEPENDENT TISSUE BEHAVIOR\nk21 = ρmk (see Problem ??), where k = (k11 - [k12k21/k22]) is the open-circuit Darcy\npermeability, or in terms of a microcontinuum surface charge or ζ (zeta)-potential\nassociated with individual matrix macromolecules.\nEqs. (1) and (2) constitute a phenomenological description of electrokinetic\ntransduction, including streaming potentials (-k21/k22) first and second electroos\nmotic flow (k12/k22 and k12, respectively), and streaming current (k21/k11), as sum\nmarized by Katchalsky and Curran, (1965).\nMaroudas (1969) was the first to measure steady-state streaming potential in\narticular cartilage, generated by a steady pressure difference applied across 400μm\nslices of tissue. She used a macroscopic, homogeneous fixed charge theory related\nto Eq. (1) to calculate the average charge density within the slab from the data.\nExperimental problems in such a steady-state measurement included concentration\npotentials due to stagnant films, and electrode offset drift. Subsequently, Maroudas\nsuggested that a cation tracer method was simpler and more accurate.\nIt is not always appreciated that Eqs. (1) and (2) may be applied to time vary\ning \"quasistatic\" forces and flows, as well as to the steady state. Several investigators\nhave measured non-steady deformation-induced streaming potentials in connective\ntissues and blood vessel walls. A model of the form (2) can be fit to the data of\nexperiments in sinusoidal steady state compression over a wide frequency range, as\nwill be discussed below.\nThe electrokinetic equations (1) and (2) also demonstrate the very important\ninfluence of tissue fixed charge groups on hydraulic permeability. When there is no\npotential gradient (∂V /∂z = 0) the permeability is just k11 from Eq. (2a), and is\ncalled the \"short circuit permeability\". When fluid flow induces streaming potentials\nso that (∂V /∂z) is not zero, then the permeability under open circuit conditions is\n[k11 - (k12k21/k22)], which can be derived from Eq. (2a,b) with J = 0. The\nk ≡\nbackflow term (k12k21/k22) represents the electrical force exerted by the streaming\npotential (∂V /∂z) on the space entrained by the fluid phase, intending to reduce the\nflow and hence lower the effective permeability. The streaming potential field can\nbe suppressed by increasing the salt concentration of the interstitial fluid. This fact\nprovides an experimental method for testing the significance of the backflow term.\n1.3.2\nCreep and Stress Relaxation Revisited\n(A comparison of single phase lumped element viscoelastic models with the predictions\nof poroelastic models)\n\n1.3. POROELASTIC MEDIA\n1.3.3\nDeformation Induced Streaming Potentials In\nHydrated Tissues\nThe Streaming Potential-Versus-Piezoelectricity Controversy\nYasuda16 first discovered that electrical potentials are generated when bone\nis bent. This property of bone was termed a piezoelectric effect.17 Several extensive\nreviews18,19, have summarized the research on this fundamental electromechanical\nproperty and its possible function in growth and remodeling of tissues.\nThe piezoelectric mechanism received wide attention. Theories were derived\nfor piezoelectricity in dry bone, in which the piezoelectric response was ascribed to\nthe collagen phase since the crystal structure of the mineral hydroxyapetite is not\nof the class of piezoelectrically active materials.20 Experiments characterized the\ndependence of deformation induced potentials in dry bone on frequency (1-1000 Hz),\nand the dependence on relative humidity in moist bone.\nInvestigators began to question whether the piezoelectric mechanism described\nthe observed electromechanical behavior of wet bone under physiological conditions.\nThe relatively fast dielectric charge relaxation times, estimated to be less than 50μsec,\nwere not compatible with observations of slow decay rates for potentials observed\nin wet bone.73 (Deformation-induced polarization charge would be screened by the\nions of the interstitial fluid to within a few Debye lengths (∼ 1nm) within a few\ncharge relaxation time constants). It was then suggested that a streaming potential\nmechanism might be compatible with experimental data in wet bone. The effect of\nthe interstitial fluid's concentration of NaCl, CaCl2, and HCl on the magnitude and\nsign of steady-flow-induced potentials, and on potentials induced in bending beam\nand sinusoidal four-point bending geometries led research groups to suggest that a\nstreaming potential mechanism is dominant. Changes in fluid viscosity also affected\nthe potential in a manner consistent with a streaming mechanism.\nFigure 8.3.1 depicts the streaming potential mechanism in terms of a macro-\ncontinuum (a) and a microcontinuum (b) picture. The material contains fixed nega\ntive charge groups and an interstitial fluid containing an excess of positive counterions\nso that electroneutrality is preserved.

Fluid entrainment of mobile ions produces a slight excess of coun\nterions in the region of the porous electrode and a slight excess of unneutralized fixed\ncharge groups at the other electrode. This charge separation produces the stream\ning potential. The microcontinuum model of Figure 8.3.1b pictures the balance of\nviscous and electrical shear stresses in the electrical double layer at the surface of a\nnegatively charged solid particle. Here, fluid convection of counterions along the sur\nface produces a streaming potential proportional to the double layer surface charge,\nor equivalently, the electrokinetic ζ-potential.\nEXAMPLE: Deformation, Fluid Flow, and Electrokinetic Response of soft\nTissue in Uniaxial Confined Compression\nDeformation-induced potentials in soft tissues such as tendon, cartilage, and\nvessel walls have been measured. A macrocontinuum poroelastic theory for streaming\npotentials in soft tissues is summarized below. This model accounts for the depen\ndence of the potential on the nonuniform fluid velocity profile within the tissue caused\nby dynamic or transient mechanical deformation of the tissue.\nThe theory incorporates the linear, nonequilibrium thermodynamic constitu\ntive laws, Eq. (2), which relate the average fluid velocity Uz (z) and current density\nJz (z) to the local pressure and potential gradients within the tissue. Figure 8.3.1a\nshows the coordinate frame of reference.\nThe current density J in Eq. (2b) is negligible when a high input impedance\nis used to measure the potential. Thus, ∂P/∂z can be written in terms of ∂V/∂z and\nEq. (2a) becomes:\nA k22\n! ∂v\nUz = -k\n(3)\nk21\n∂z\nTo find the streaming potential measured between the positive electrode at\nz = 0 (articular surface) and the negative electrode at z = ω, Eq.

If the velocity profile ˆU(z, ω) can be measured or calculated, then the\nstreaming potential Vˆ(ω) can be computed and compared to experimental results.\n\nCHAPTER 1. TIME DEPENDENT TISSUE BEHAVIOR\nTo estimate the velocity profile, the fundamental equations of poroelasticity\nare combined as described in Section 8.2. As cartilage is deformed, the internal\nelectrical potential and fluid velocity fields will vary with position inside the matrix\nin a manner that must be consistent with the internal deformation and stress fields.\nThe velocity and deformation fields are related by continuity, Eq. (8.2.8) (assuming\nthat the fluid and solid phases are each incompressible),\nU(z, ω) = -jωˆu(z, ω)\n(5)\nThe displacement profile was solved for the case of sinusoidal steady state uni\naxial confined compression to predict the of Eq. (5) for bulk cartilage. In addition, a\nlumped parameter spring constant Ks was included to account for observed proper\nties of the porous platen and the local three-dimensional interdigitation between the\ncartilage surface and the porous filter connected to the load cell:\nA\n(Ks/A)\n! sinh γ(δ - z)\nˆu(z, ω) = uo\n(6)\n(Ks/A) + Hγ coth γδ\nsinh γδ\nwhere A is the specimen cross-sectional area, H is the matrix equilibrium elastic\nmodulus, γ is the complex wavenumber (1 + j)[ω/2Hk]δ is the specimen thickness,\nand uo is the imposed dynamic displacement. For f < 0.01 to 0.1 Hz, it was found\nthat Ks/A A Hγδ coth γδ and the term in brackets in Eq. (6) becomes unity. The\ndisplacement field (6) corresponds to a diffusion wave characterized by the skin depth\n(2Hk/ω). The sinusoidal streaming potential amplitude and phase angle ψ corre\nsponding to the displacement field (6) was obtained by using Eqs. (5) and (6) in\nEq.

(7) and (8) has been com\npared to deformation induced potentials measured across plugs of bovine articular\ncartilage in uniaxial confined compression. Specimens from the femoropatellar groove\nwere tested from 0.001 Hz to 20 Hz. The mechanical stiffness, mechanical phase angle\nbetween stress and displacement, and the electrical potential and its phase angle were\ncompared to the corresponding mechanical theory. By curve fitting the mechanical\ntheory to data, H, k and Ks were computed for each specimen (Figure 8.3.2a). This\n\n1.3. POROELASTIC MEDIA\nis important since the electrical phase angle ψ (Eq. (8)) contains no other adjustable\nparameters. The reasonable fit between experimental and theoretical ψ over the en\ntire frequency range (Figure 8.3.2b) was interpreted as very strong evidence that the\ndeformation-induced potentials were produced by a streaming (electrokinetic) mecha\nnism. Hence, use of the simultaneous measurement of streaming potential can provide\nimportant information on velocity and deformation fields within articular cartilage,\nsubjected to various mechanical deformations.\nA powerful technique for isolating transduction mechanism is to characterize\nits kinetics. Here, the kinetics of the measured potentials are embodied in the electri\ncal phase angle ψ, which was compared to a macrocontinuum theoretical model based\non the flow of fluid relative to a charged matrix. A significant piezoelectric response\nin cartilage would be highly unlikely due to macroscopic symmetry considerations,\nand due to the fast charge relaxation time constants (10-7 to 10-9 sec).\nIt could be hypothesized that pulse-like mechanical deformations in wet bone\nand cartilage may produce an initial piezoelectric spike followed by a more slowly\nvarying streaming potential response. However, successful detection of even nanosec\nond potential spikes is not conclusive evidence of a piezoelectric mechanism because\nthe frequency response of a streaming mechanism in a microporous medium may also\nbe very high. An order of magnitude estimate of the latter can be computed from the\nviscous diffusion time constant τv.d. associated with the onset of full-developed creep\ning flow in a capillary of radius R. Given fluid viscosity η and density ρ, dimensional\nanalysis of the Navier-Stokes equation gives\nρ2\nτv.d.\n(9)\n' η\nwhere τv.d. ∼ 10-6 - 10-10sec for R = 10-6 - 10-8m respectively. Since the streaming\npotential mechanism is usually based on the assumption of viscous dominated creeping\nflow, may be taken as a measure of the frequency response of this mechanism."

The objective of this\nproblem is to obtain an estimate the \"hydraulic permeability\" of this matrix.\na) First, estimate using a scaling analysis how the drag force per unit length acting on\none isolated fiber scales with the velocity of flow perpendicular to its axis (V), the\nfiber diameter (d) and the viscosity of the fluid (m), on the assumption that inertial\neffects can be neglected1.\nb) Now consider a matrix comprised of identical, parallel fibers.

Introduction\nDimensional analysis offers a method for reducing complex physical\nproblems to the simplest (that is, most economical) form prior to obtaining\na quantitative answer. Bridgman (1969) explains it thus: \"The principal\nuse of dimensional analysis is to deduce from a study of the dimensions of\nthe variables in any physical system certain limitations on the form of any\npossible relationship between those variables. The method is of great\ngenerality and mathematical simplicity\".\nAt the heart of dimensional analysis is the concept of similarity. In\nphysical terms, similarity refers to some equivalence between two things\nor phenomena that are actually different. For example, under some very\nparticular conditions there is a direct relationship between the forces\nacting on a full-size aircraft and those on a small-scale model of it. The\nquestion is, what are those conditions, and what is the relationship\nbetween the forces? Mathematically, similarity refers to a transformation\nof variables that leads to a reduction in the number of independent\nvariables that specify the problem. Here the question is, what kind of\ntransformation works? Dimensional analysis addresses both these\nquestions. Its main utility derives from its ability to contract, or make\nmore succinct, the functional form of physical relationships. A problem\nthat at first looks formidable may sometimes be solved with little effort\nafter dimensional analysis.\nIn problems so well understood that one can write down in\nmathematical form all the governing laws and boundary conditions, and\nonly the solution is lacking, similarity can also be inferred by normalizing\nall the equations and boundary conditions in terms of quantities that\nspecify the problem and identifying the dimensionless groups that appear\nin the resulting dimensionless equations. This is an inspectional form of\nsimilarity analysis. Since inspectional analysis can take advantage of the\nproblem's full mathematical specification, it may reveal a higher degree of\nsimilarity than a \"blind\" (less informed) dimensional analysis and in that\nsense prove more powerful. Dimensional analysis is, however, the only\noption in problems where the equations and boundary conditions are not\ncompletely articulated, and always useful because it is simple to apply and\nquick to give insight.\nSome of the basic ideas of similarity and dimensional analysis had\nalready surfaced in Fourier's work in the nineteenth century's first quarter,\n\nbut the subject received more methodical attention only toward the close\nof that century, notably in the works of Lord Rayleigh, Reynolds,\nMaxwell, and Froude in England, and Carvallo, Vaschy and a number of\nother scientists and engineers in France (Macagno, 1971)4. By the 1920's\nthe principles were essentially in place: Buckingham's now ubiquitous\nπ-theorem had appeared (Buckingham, 1914), and Bridgman had\npublished the monograph which still remains the classic in the field\n(Bridgman, 1922, 1931). Since then, the literature has grown prodigiously.\nApplications now include aerodynamics, hydraulics, ship design,\npropulsion, heat and mass transfer, combustion, mechanics of elastic and\nplastic structures, fluid-structure interactions, electromagnetic theory,\nradiation, astrophysics, underwater and underground explosions, nuclear\nblasts, impact dynamics, and chemical reactions and processing (see for\nexample Sedov, 1959, Baker et al, 1973, Kurth, 1972, Lokarnik, 1991),\nand also biology (McMahon & Bonner, 1983) and even economics (de\nJong, 1967).\nMost applications of dimensional analysis are not in question, no\ndoubt because they are well supported by experimental facts. The debate\nover the method's theoretical-philosophical underpinnings, on the other\nhand, has never quite stopped festering (e.g. Palacios, 1964).\nMathematicians tend to find in the basic arguments a lack of rigor and are\ntempted to redefine the subject in their own terms (e.g. Brand, 1957),\nwhile physicists and engineers often find themselves uncertain about the\nphysical meanings of the words in terms of which the analysis cast. The\nproblem is that dimensional analysis is based on ideas that originate at\nsuch a substratal point in science that most scientists and engineers have\nlost touch with them. To understand its principles, we must return to some\nof the very fundamental concepts in science.\nDimensional analysis is rooted in the nature of the artifices we\nconstruct in order to describe the physical world and explain its\nfunctioning in quantitative terms. Einstein (1933) has said, \"Pure logical\nthinking cannot yield us any knowledge of the empirical world; all\nknowledge starts from experience and ends in it. Propositions arrived at by\npurely logical means are completely empty as regards reality.\"\n4 See, for example, the very first page of the first volume of James Clerk Maxwell's A\ntreatise on Electricity and Magnetism (third edition, Clarendon Press, Cambridge, 1891;\nrepublished by Dover, New York, 1954)\n\nThis treatise is an attempt to explain dimensional analysis by tracing it\nback to its physical foundations. We will clarify the terms used in\ndimensional analysis, explain why and how it works, remark on its utility,\nand discuss some of the difficulties and questions that typically arise in its\napplication. One single (unremarkable) application in mechanics will be\nused to illustrate the procedure and its pitfalls. The procedure is the same\nin all applications, a great variety of which may be found in the references\nand in the scientific literature at large.\n\n2. Physical Quantities and Equations\n2.1 Physical properties\nScience begins with the observation and precise description of things and\nevents. It is at this very first step that we face the fact upon which\ndimensional analysis rests: Description in absolute terms is impossible.\nWe can do no more than compare one thing with another, to \"catch the\nresemblance of things\". When we say that something \"is\" a tree, we mean\nsimply that it has a set of attributes that are in some way shared by certain\nfamiliar objects we have agreed to call trees.\nOur brains have evolved to the point where we can recognize trees\nalmost instantly, but describing something like a tree is actually a very\ncomplex business. Physics starts by breaking the descriptive process down\ninto simpler terms. An object or event is described in terms of basic\nproperties like length, mass, color, shape, speed, and time. None of these\nproperties can be defined in absolute terms, but only by reference to\nsomething else: an object has the length of a meter stick, we say, the color\nof an orange, the weight of a certain familiar lump of material, or the\nshape of a sphere. The references may be made more precise, but in\nessence \"description\" is simply a noting of the similarities between one\nthing and a set of others that are known to us. We can do no more than\ncompare one thing with another.\nA physical property first arises as a concept based on experience, and\nis formalized by defining a comparison operation for determining whether\ntwo samples of it are equal (A=B) or unequal (A B). (We shall use bold\nsymbols when we are referring not to numerical values, but to actual\nphysical attributes.) This operation, which is an entirely physical\nprocedure, defines the property. Properties of the same kind (or simply, the\nsame properties) are compared by means of the same comparison\noperation. Properties of different kinds cannot be compared because there\nexists no operation that defines equality. Asking whether a particular mass\nis physically equal to a particular length is meaningless: no procedure\nexists for making the comparison.\nIf a property is defined only in terms of a comparison operation, we\nhave a procedure for establishing whether two samples of it are equal or\nunequal, but no concept of what it means for one to be larger or smaller\nthan the other. Shape and color are examples. We have procedures for\n\ndetermining if two objects have the same shape, or the same color. But\nasking whether a square shape is smaller or larger than a circular shape, or\nwhether green is smaller or larger than white, makes no sense. Properties\nlike shape and color are useful for describing things, but cannot play a role\nin any quantitative analysis, which deals with relative magnitudes.\n2.2 Physical quantities and base quantities\nScience begins with observation and description, but its ultimate goal is to\ninfer from those observations laws that express the phenomena of the\nphysical world in the simplest and most general (that is, most economical)\nterms. That the language of mathematics is ideally suited for expressing\nthose laws is not accidental, but follows from the constraints we put on the\ntypes of physical properties that are allowed to appear in quantitative\nanalysis. The allowed types of properties are called \"physical quantities\".\nPhysical quantities are of two types: base quantities and derived\nquantities. The base quantities, which are defined in entirely physical\nterms, form a complete set of basic building blocks for an open-ended\nsystem of \"derived\" quantities that may be introduced as necessary. The\nbase and derived quantities together provide a rational basis for describing\nand analyzing the physical world in quantitative terms.\nA base quantity is defined by specifying two physical operations:\na comparison operation for determining whether two samples A\nand B of the property are equal (A=B) or unequal (A B), and\nan addition operation that defines what is meant by the sum\nC=A+B of two samples of the property.\nBase quantities with the same comparison and addition operations are of\nthe same kind (that is, different examples of the same quantity). The\naddition operation A+B defines a physical quantity C of the same kind as\nthe quantities being added. Quantities with different comparison and\naddition operations cannot be compared or added; no procedures exist for\nexecuting such operations. All physical quantities are properties of\nphysical things or events. They are not themselves physical things or\nevents. The comparison and addition operations involve physical\n\nmanipulations of objects or events that possess the property under\nconsideration (see the examples below).\nThe comparison and addition operations are physical, but they are\nrequired to have certain properties that mimic those of the corresponding\nmathematical operations for pure numbers:\nA=B and\nB=C, then A=C), and\nA+B=B+A), associative\n[A+(B+C)=(A+B)+C], and unique (if A+B=C, there exists no finite\nD such that A+B+D=C).\nThe two operations together define, in entirely physical terms,\nfinite B such that A+B=C, then C>A),\n(2) subtraction of like quantities (if A+B=C, then A C-B),\npure number (if B=A+A+A,\nthen B 3A), and\npure number (if A=B+B+B, then\nB A/3).\nA base quantity is thus a property for which the following mathematical\noperations are defined in physical terms: comparison, addition,\nsubtraction, multiplication by a pure number, and division by a pure\nnumber. Each of these operations is performed on physical properties of\nthe same kind and yields a physical property of that kind, and each\nphysical operation obeys the same rules as the corresponding\nmathematical operation for pure numbers.\nThis sets the stage for not only \"catching the resemblance of things\",\nbut also expressing that resemblance in the language of mathematics.\nIt is important to note that mathematical operations other than the ones\nlisted above are not defined in physical terms. No defining operation exists\nfor forming a tangible entity that represents the product of a mass and a\ntime, for example, or, for that matter, the product of one length and\nanother (more on this later). Nor can we point to some tangible thing that\n\"is\" the cube root of a length, say, or the natural logarithm of a time.\nProducts, ratios, powers, and exponential and other functions such as\n(1) The comparison operation must obey the identity law (if\n(2) the addition operation must be commutative (\n(1) the concept of larger and smaller for like quantities (if there exists a\n(3) multiplication of a physical quantity by a\n(4) division of a physical quantity by a\n\ntrigonometric functions and logarithms are defined for numbers, but have\nno physical correspondence in operations involving actual physical\nquantities.\nFigure 2.1 illustrates the comparison and addition operations of some\nwell-known physical quantities that can be chosen as base quantities. The\nfigure shows them in simplistic, cartoon-like terms, but we are of course\naware that each operation is actually associated with a carefully articulated\nprocedure and a set of concepts that are often quite complex. For our\npresent purpose we take these for granted, much like Dr. Samuel Johnson\nwho, when queried about how he knew that the physical world really\nexisted, satisfied himself by stamping his foot on the pavement.\nFigure 2.1a: The comparison and addition operations of length.\nFigure 2.1b: The comparison and addition operations of mass.\n\nFigure 2.1c: The comparison and addition operations of area.\nFigure 2.1d: The comparison and addition operations of velocity.\nFigure 2.1e: The comparison and addition operations of force.\nThe comparison and addition operations for length and mass are\nfamiliar. Only one comment is necessary: the mass referred to in the figure\nis the \"gravitational mass\", for which equality is defined by the statement\n\nthat two masses are equal if a third mass exerts the same gravitational\nforce on each of them separately at the same relative position.\nTime is omitted from the figure, largely because its defining\noperations defy illustration in such simplistic terms. The concept of time is\ndeeply rooted in our biological beings. It is, after all, the warp of our\nexistence, the stuff, as some wit pointed out, that keeps everything from\nhappening at once. Time characterizes an event, not a thing. Aristotle\nreferred to time as a \"dimension of motion\", which pleases the poet in us,\nbut leaves the scientist unmoved. We do best if we adopt a pragmatic\nnotion of time and think of it as being defined in terms of comparison and\naddition operations involving idealized clocks or stopwatches, much like\nEinstein did in his popular exposition of the theory of relativity (Einstein,\n1952). Whether those clocks are hourglasses or atomic clocks will affect\nthe precision of the operations, but not their intrinsic character. What time\n\"is\" has no relevance in the present context, only the defining operations\nmatter5.\nThe concept of force arises in primitive terms from muscular effort,\nand is formalized based on the observation that a net force on an object\n(the vector sum of all the forces acting on the object) causes a rate of\nchange in its velocity. Directionality is important in the definition: force is\na vector quantity.\nA reader accustomed to considering speed as \"distance divided by\ntime\" and area as \"length squared\" may be surprised to see them included\nin figure 2.1 as (possible) base quantities with their own comparison and\naddition operations. We include them to show that the set of base\nquantities is very much a matter of choice. Velocity (or speed, if direction\nis presumed) is a certain property of motion. A self-propelled toy car\nrunning across a tabletop has a speed, and we can define acceptable\nprocedures for establishing whether two speeds are equal or unequal and\nfor adding two speeds, as in figure 2.1d. Speed can therefore be taken as a\nbase quantity, should we choose to do so. The same goes for area. Note\nthat two areas may be equal without being congruent, provided one of\n5 Sir Arthur Eddinton (1939): \"It has come to be accepted practice in introducing new\nphysical quantities that they shall be regarded as defined by the series of measuring\noperations and calculations of which they are the result. Those who associate with the\nresult a mental picture of some entity disporting itself in a metaphysical realm of\nexistence do so at their own risk; physics can accept no responsibility for this\nembellishment\".\n\nthem can be \"cut up\" and reassembled (added back together) into a form\nwhich is congruent with the other: the addition operation is invoked in\nmaking a comparison, and the comparison operation in addition.\nWe have said that shape and color, though acceptable physical\nproperties, cannot be base quantities because they lack acceptable addition\noperations. That shape is disqualified is obvious: what is the sum of a\nsquare and a circle? But why is color disqualified? We know that color in\nthe form of light can be added according to well-defined rules, as when\nred light added to green produces yellow. Is this not an acceptable\ndefinition of physical addition? The answer is no. Blue equals blue. But\naccording to this addition operation, blue plus blue also equals blue. The\naddition operation is not unique: nA=A for any color A, where n is any\nnumber. This disqualifies color from the ranks of physical quantities (and\nmakes measurement of color in terms of a unit impossible). But, the\npersistent reader may argue, the color of an object can be identified by the\nwavelength of light reflected from it, and wavelength can be added. Is this\nnot acceptable for an addition rule? The answer is again no. This is a rule\nfor adding lengths, not for adding the property we perceive as color.\n2.3 Unit and numerical value\nThe two operations that define a base quantity make it possible to\nexpress any such quantity as a multiple of a standard sample of its own\nkind, that is, to \"measure it in terms of a unit\". The standard sample--the\nunit--may be chosen arbitrarily. The comparison operation allows the\nreplication of the unit, and the addition operation allows the identification\nand replication of fractions of the unit. The measuring process consists of\nphysically adding replicas of the unit and fractions thereof until the sum\nequals the quantity being measured (figure 2.2). A count of the number\nof whole and fractional units required yields the numerical value of\nthe quantity being measured. If a is the unit chosen for quantities of type\nA, the process of measurement yields a numerical value A (a number)\nsuch that\nA = Aa\n(2.1)\nThe measurement process is entirely physical. The only mathematics\ninvolved is the counting of the number of whole and fractional units once\n\nphysical equality has been established between the quantity being\nmeasured and a sum of replicas of the unit and fractions thereof.\nFigure 2.2: Measurement in terms of a unit and numerical value\nIt should be emphasized that numbers can be ascribed to properties in\nmany arbitrary ways, but such numbers will not represent numerical\nvalues of physical quantities unless they are assigned by a procedure\nconsistent with the one defined above.\nThe numerical value of a base quantity depends on the choice of unit.\nA physical quantity exists, independent of the choice of unit. My\nforefinger has the same length, regardless of whether I measure it in\ncentimeters or inches. A quantity A can be measured in terms of a unit a or\nin terms of another unit a', but the quantity itself remains physically the\nsame, that is,\nA = Aa = A'a'.\n(2.2)\nIf the unit a' is n times larger than a,\na' =na,\n(2.3)\nit follows from equation (2.2) that\nA′ = n\n-1A .\n(2.4)\nIf the size of a base quantity's unit is changed by a factor n, the quantity's\nnumerical value changes by a factor n-1 .\nBy convention, all base quantities of the same kind are always\nmeasured in terms of the same unit. All base quantities of the same kind\n\nthus change by the same factor when the size of that quantity's unit is\nchanged. That is, the ratio of the numerical values of any two quantities of\nthe same kind is independent of base unit size.\nNote also that when base quantities of the same kind are added\nphysically (A+B=C), the numerical values satisfy an equation of the same\nform as the physical quantity equation (A+B=C), regardless of the size of\nthe chosen unit. In other words, the numerical value equation mimics the\nphysical equation, and its form is independent of the unit's size.\n2.4 Derived quantities, dimensions, and dimensionless quantities\nIn describing physical things and events quantitatively, we refer to\nnumerical values of base quantities, and also introduce numbers derived\nby inserting these values into certain mathematical formulas. We\ndetermine the distance L that an object moves in time t, for example, and\ncalculate its speed V=Lt-1; or we measure a body's mass m and speed V and\ncalculate its kinetic energy K=mV2/2. These numbers are derived\nquantities of the first kind.\nNot all numbers obtained by inserting base quantities into formulas\ncan be considered physical quantities6. Base quantities have a\ntransparently physical origin, which gives rise to the fact that the ratio of\nany two samples of a base quantity remains constant when the base unit\nsize is changed; an arbitrary choice cannot affect a relative physical\nmagnitude. Bridgman (1931) postulated that this is in fact a defining\nattribute of all physical quantities. This is\nBridgman's principle of absolute significance of relative magnitude:\nA number Q obtained by inserting the numerical values of base\nquantities into a formula is a physical quantity if the ratio of any\ntwo samples of it remains constant when base unit sizes are\nchanged.\nBridgman went on to show (Bridgman, 1931; see also the proof by\nBarenblatt, 1996) that a monomial formula satisfies the principle of\n6 From this point on, the term quantity will be used for the numerical value of a physical\nquantity, unless otherwise noted.\n\nabsolute significance of relative magnitude only if it has the power-law\nform\nA\naB\nbC\nc ...\n(2.5)\nQ =\nwhere A, B, C, etc. are numerical values of base quantities and the\ncoefficient\nand exponents a, b, c, etc. are real numbers whose values\ndistinguish one type of derived quantity from another. All monomial\nderived quantities have this power-law form; no other form represents a\nphysical quantity.\nA derived quantity of the first kind is defined in terms of a numerical\nvalue, which depends on the choice of base units. A derived quantity does\nnot necessarily represent something tangible in the same sense as a base\nquantity, although it may. The square root of time, for example, is a\nderived quantity because it has the required power-law form, but we\ncannot point to any physical thing that \"is\" the square root of time.\nTo avoid talking of \"units\" for quantities that may have no physical\nrepresentation, but whose numerical values nevertheless depend on the\nchoice of base units, we introduce the concept of dimension. Each type of\nbase quantity has by definition its own dimension. If A is the numerical\nvalue of a length, we say it \"has the dimension of length\", and write this as\n[A]=L where the square brackets imply \"the dimension of\" and L\nsymbolizes the concept of length. By this we mean simply that if the\nlength unit size is increased by a factor n, the numerical value A will\nincrease by a factor n-1 .\nThe dimension of a derived quantity conveys the same information in\ngeneralized form, for derived as well as base quantities. Consider a\nquantity defined by the formula\nl 2\nm2\nQ = L\nl\n1 L2 ...M1\nm1 M2 ...t1\n1 t2 ...\n(2.6)\nwhere the Li's are numerical values of certain lengths, Mi's of certain\nmasses, and ti's of certain times, and\nand all exponents are real numbers.\nIf the length unit is changed by a factor nL , the mass unit by a factor nm ,\nand the time unit by a factor nt , it follows from equations (2.4) and (2.6)\nthat the value of Q changes to\nQ′ = n\n-1Q\n(2.7a)\n\nwhere\n∑ li\n∑ mi\n∑ ti\nn = (nL )\n(nm )\n(n )\n.\n(2.7b)\nt\nThis implies that Q transforms like the numerical value of a base quantity\n∑mi\n∑ i\nwith a unit whose size is proportional to L\n∑liM t , where L, M, and t\nrepresent the sizes of the length, mass, and time units, respectively. By\nanalogy with the meaning of dimension for base quantities [see equation\n(2.4)], we therefore say that the derived quantity Q has the dimension\n∑ ti\n[Q] = (L)\n∑ l i (M)\n∑ mi (t)\n.\n(2.8)\nWhether applied to a base or derived quantity, the dimension is simply\na formulaic indication of how the quantity's numerical value transforms\nwhen the sizes of the base units are changed. A derived quantity's\ndimension follows from its defining equation. To obtain the result (2.8) for\nthe quantity defined in equation (2.6), we simply substitute for each base\nquantity in equation (2.6) the symbol for its dimension, omit the numerical\ncoefficient α, and obtain equation (2.8) by algebra. The dimension of a\n-2\nkinetic energy mV\n2 2, for example, is M(\n)\nL t\n= ML\n2t .\nStatements to the effect that a quantity's dimension is an \"expression\nof its essential physical nature\" (Tolman, 1917) are either a meaningless\ntautology (in the case of base quantities) or nonsense (in the case of\nderived quantities). We shall see that a quantity's dimension depends on\nthe choice of the system of units, and is therefore under the control of the\nobserver rather than an inherent attribute of that quantity.\nBy convention, a particular derived quantity is specified by its\nnumerical value followed by the base units upon which that value is based,\nthe latter arranged in a form which reflects the quantity's dimension. The\nstatement Q = 0.021kg s1/2 implies that Q is a quantity with dimension\nMt\n1 2and has a magnitude 0.021 if mass is measured in kilograms and\ntime in seconds. Speaking loosely, it may be said that the quantity Q is\n\"measured in units of kg s1/2\", which implies both its dimension and the\nbase units on which the indicated value is based. In common parlance the\nterms unit and dimension are often used synonymously, but such usage is\nundesirable in a treatise where fundamental understanding is paramount.\n\nSome important points about derived quantities:\n1. The dimension of any derived physical quantity is a product of\npowers of the base quantity dimensions.\n2. Sums of derived quantities with the same dimension are derived\nquantities of the same dimension. Products and ratios of derived quantities\nare also derived quantities, with dimensions which are usually different\nfrom the original quantities.\n3. All derived quantities with the same dimension change their values\nby the same factor when the sizes of the base units are changed.\n4. A derived quantity is dimensionless if its numerical value remains\ninvariant when the base units are changed. An example is\n, where\nVt L\nV =\nis a velocity, t is a time and L is a length. The dimension of a\ndx dt\ndimensionless quantity is unity, the factor by which the quantity's\nnumerical value changes when base units sizes are changed.\n5. Special functions (logarithmic, exponential, trigonometric, etc.) of\ndimensional derived quantities are in general not derived quantities\nbecause their values do not in general transform like derived quantities\nwhen base unit size changes. Only when the arguments of these functions\nare dimensionless will the arguments and therefore the values of the\nfunctions remain invariant when units are changed. Special functions with\ndimensionless arguments are therefore derived quantities with dimension\nunity.\n2.5 Physical equations, dimensional homogeneity, and physical\nconstants\nIn quantitative analysis of physical events one seeks mathematical\nrelationships between the numerical values of the physical quantities that\ndescribe the event. We are not, however, interested in just any\nrelationships that may apply between the values of physical quantities. A\nprimitive soul may find it remarkable, or even miraculous, that his own\nmass in kilograms is exactly equal to his height in inches. We dismiss this\nkind of \"relationship\" as an accidental result of the choice of units.\nScience is concerned only with expressing a physical relationship between\none quantity and a set of others, that is, with \"physical equations.\" Nature\nis indifferent to the arbitrary choices we make when we pick base units.\nWe are interested, therefore, only in numerical relationships that remain\ntrue independent of base unit size.\n\nThis puts certain constraints on the allowable form of physical\nequations. Suppose that, in a specified physical event, the numerical value\nQo of a physical quantity is determined by the numerical values of a set\nQ1...Q other physical quantities, that is,\nn\nQo = f (Q1,Q2,...,Qn ),\n(2.9)\nThe principle of absolute significance of relative values tells us that the\nrelationship implied by equation (2.9) can be physically relevant only if Qo\nand f change by the same factor when the magnitudes of any base units are\nchanged. In other words, a physical equation must be dimensionally\nhomogeneous. Some reflection based on the points summarized at the end\nof Section 2.4 will show that dimensional homogeneity imposes the\nfollowing constraints on any mathematical representation of a relationship\nlike equation (2.9):\n(1) both sides of the equation must have the same dimension;\n(2) wherever a sum of quantities appears in f, all the terms in the sum\nmust have the same dimension;\n(3) all arguments of any exponential, logarithmic, trigonometric or\nother special functions that appear in f must be dimensionless.\nFor example, if a physical equation is represented by\nA = Be\n-C -(D1 + D2) + F ,\n(2.10)\nE\nC must be dimensionless, D1 and D must have the same dimension, and A,\nB, D/E and F must have the same dimension.\nAn important consequence of dimensional homogeneity is that the\nform of a physical equation is independent of the size of the base units.\nThe following example may help to illustrate the reason for\ndimensional homogeneity in physical equations and show how conceptual\nerrors that may arise if homogeneity isn't recognized. Suppose we release\nan object from rest in a uniform gravitational field, in vacuum, and ask\nwhat distance x it will fall in a time t. We know of course that elementary\nNewtonian mechanics gives the answer as\n\nx = gt ,\n(2.11)\nwhere g is the local acceleration of gravity and has the dimension Lt-2 .\nThis equation expresses the result of a general physical law, and is clearly\ndimensionally homogeneous.\nThe physical basis of dimensional homogeneity becomes apparent\nwhen we consider the same phenomenon from a different perspective.\nSuppose we are ignorant of mechanics and conduct a large variety of\nexperiments in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on the time t it takes a body\nwith mass m to fall a distance x from rest in an evacuated chamber. After\nperforming experiments with numerous masses and distances, we find that\nif t is measured in seconds and x in meters, all our data can be accurately\nrepresented, regardless of mass, with the single equation\nx = 4.91t\n2.\n(2.12)\nThis is a perfectly correct equation. It describes and predicts all\nexperiments (in Cambridge, Massachusetts) to a very good accuracy.\nHowever, it appears at first glance to be dimensionally non-homogeneous,\nthe two sides seemingly having different dimensions, and thus appears not\nto be a true physical equation. This impression is, however, based on the\nfalse presumption that the coefficient 4.91 remains invariant when units\nare changed. In fact, the coefficient 4.91 represents not a dimensionless\nnumber, but a particular numerical value of a dimensional physical\nquantity which characterizes the relationship between x and t in the\nCambridge area. That this must be so becomes clear when we consider\nhow equation (2.12) must transform when units are changed. We know\nthat when units are changed, the actual physical distance x remains\ninvariant, and we therefore argue that to obtain the falling distance in feet,\nfor example, the right hand side of equation (2.12), which gives it in\nmeters, must be multiplied by 3.28, the number of feet in one meter.\nThus, if x is measured in feet and t in seconds, the correct version of\nequation (2.12) is\nx = 16.1t\n2 .\n(2.13)\n\nThis same transformation could also have been obtained by arguing that\nequation (2.12), being an expression of a general physical law, must,\naccording to Bridgman's principle of absolute significance of relative\nmagnitude, be dimensionally homogeneous, and therefore should properly\nhave been written\nx = ct\n(c = 4.91ms\n-2 )\n(2.14)\nThis form makes clear that the coefficient c is a physical quantity rather\nthan a numerical coefficient. The units of c indicate its dimension and\nshow that a change of the length unit from meters to feet, with the time\nunit remaining invariant, changes c by the factor 3.28, the inverse of the\nfactor by which the length unit is changed. This gives c=16.1 ft s-2, as in\nequation (2.13).\nEquation (2.14) is the correct way of representing the data of equation\n(2.11). It is dimensionally homogeneous, and makes the transformation to\ndifferent base units straightforward.\nEvery correct physical equation--that is, every equation that expresses\na physically significant relationship between numerical values of physical\nquantities--must be dimensionally homogeneous. A fitting formula\nderived from correct empirical data may at first sight appear dimensionally\nnon-homogeneous because it is intended for particular base units. Such\nformulas can always be rewritten in general, homogeneous form by the\nfollowing procedure (Bridgman, 1931):\n(1) Replace all the numerical coefficients in the equation with unknown\ndimensional constants.\n(2) Determine the dimensions of these constants by requiring that the new\nequation be dimensionally homogeneous.\n(3) Determine the numerical values of the constants by matching them\nwith those in the original equation when the units are the same.\nThis is of course how equation (2.14) was derived from equation\n(2.12).\nAnother example serves to reinforce this point. Suppose it is found that\nthe pressure distribution in the earth's atmosphere over much of the United\nStates can be represented (approximately) by the formula\n\n-0.00012z\np = 1.01x10\n5 e\n(2.15)\nwhere p is the pressure in Nm-2 and z is the altitude in meters. This\nexpression applies only with the cited units. The correct, dimensionally\nhomogeneous form of this equation is\n-bz\n-1)\np = ae\n( a = 1.01× 10\n5 Nm\n-2, b = 0.00012m\n(2.16)\nwhere a and b are physical quantities. In this form the equation is valid\nindependent of the chosen base units. The dimensions of a and b indicate\nhow these quantities change when units are changed.\nThe two quantities a and b in equation (2.16) are physical constants in\nthe sense that their values are fixed once the system of units is chosen. In\nthis case the constants characterize a particular environment⎯the pressure\ndistribution in the earth's atmosphere over the US. Similarly, the\nacceleration of gravity g in equation (2.11) is a physical constant that\ncharacterizes the (local!) gravitational force field at the earth's surface.\nThe basic laws of physics also contain a number of universal physical\nconstants whose magnitudes are the same in all problems once the system\nof units is chosen: the speed of light in vacuum c, the universal\ngravitational constant G, Planck's constant h, Boltzmann's constant kB,\nand many others.\n2.6 Derived quantities of the second kind\nThe classification of quantities as base or derived is not unique. There\nexist general laws that bind different kinds of quantities together in certain\nrelationships, and these laws can be used to transform base quantities into\nderived ones. Such transformations are useful because they reduce the\nnumber of units that must be chosen arbitrarily, and simplify the forms of\nphysical laws.\nArea, for example, may be taken as a base quantity with its own\ncomparison and addition operations, and measured in terms of an\narbitrarily chosen (base) unit: a certain postage stamp, say, to use an\nabsurd example. The floor area of a room may be measured by covering\nthe floor with copies of this postage stamp and parts thereof, and counting\nthe number of whole stamps required. If we adopt this practice we will\neventually find that, regardless of the unit we have chosen for measuring\n\nan area A, its numerical value A will depend on its linear dimensions\naccording to\nA = c∫dxdy\n(2.17)\nwhere the integral is taken over the area and c is a dimensional constant\nthe magnitude of which depends on the choice of base units of area and\nlength. Dimensional homogeneity requires that c be a derived quantity,\nA\nc = ∫dxdy\n(2.18)\nwith dimension AL-2 .\nEquation (2.17) can be thought of as a \"physical law.\" A little\nreflection reveals, however, that it holds simply because the quantity we\nhave symbolized as dxdy is defined by comparison and addition rules that\nhappen to be similar to those we have chosen for area. Equation (2.17) is\nthus not really a law of nature, but one have crafted ourselves.\nDimensional constants like c in Equation (2.17) whose values depend\non the choice of units but are entirely independent of the problem being\nconsidered are called universal constant.\nThe law (2.17) suggests a simplification. If we choose to measure area\nin terms of a unit that is defined by the area of a square with sides equal to\nthe length unit, the physical coefficient c becomes unity, and equation\n(2.17) becomes\nA = ∫dxdy\n(2.19)\nArea, in effect, has become a derived quantity that is defined in terms of\noperations involving length. Equation (2.19) does not imply that area now\n\"is\", in any physical sense, length squared. The physical property that is\narea remains what it was before, quite distinct from length, and for that\nmatter quite distinct from \"length squared\", of which we have no physical\nconcept whatsoever. We have simply noted that, because our concepts of\n\"integral\" and \"area\" are in fact similar, we may choose to measure area\nvia operations involving length, and have made a decision to do so. The\nfact that area now has the dimension L2 simply indicates that the numerical\n\nvalue of any area so defined will change by a factor n\n-2 when the length\nunit is changed by a factor n.\nBy transforming area in this way from a base to a derived quantity, we\nhave accomplished two simplifications: the length unit automatically\ndetermines the area unit, and the dimensional physical constant c in\nequation (2.17) is replaced with unity.\nThere is nothing sacred about choosing c=1 in this kind of\ntransformation. We could have adopted as the unit for area circle with\ndiameter equal to one length unit, in which case area would have been\ndefined by\nhave been perfectly acceptable, but less convenient since it would force us\nto waste a lot of paper writing unnecessary 4/π's. In other instances,\ndimensionless coefficients other than unity are introduced deliberately to\nmake things more convenient. For example, by defining the kinetic energy\nas K = mV\n2 2 instead of K = mV\n2 we make the energy equation for a\npoint mass in a force field read K+U=constant instead of K/2+U=constant,\nwhere U is the force potential. Similarly, the 4π terms that appear in the SI\nsystem of units in the integral forms of Gauss's and Ampere's laws are\nplaced there in order to eliminate numerical coefficients in the differential\nforms (Maxwell's field equations).\nA = ( 4 / )∫dxdy instead of by equation (2.19). This would\nSpeed offers an example similar to area. We may define speed as a\nbase quantity with its own comparison and addition operations, and\nchoose for it a base unit--the speed of a certain very reliable wind-up toy\non a horizontal surface, say, to use again an absurd example. If we take\nthis route we would eventually discover that the quantity we have\nidentified as speed is in fact proportional to the distance covered in unit\ntime. We can then choose to define speed as the derived quantity V=dx/dt,\nwhich is equivalent to choosing a speed unit such that unit distance is\ncovered in unit time.\nA more interesting example arises with force. Force may be taken as a\nbase quantity with an arbitrarily specified unit--the (equilibrium) force\nrequired to extend a standard spring a given distance, say. Newton's\noriginal law of motion states that if a body (a \"point mass\", to be precise)\nof mass m is subjected to a net force F (in the x-direction, say) under non\nrelativistic conditions, it accelerates in the direction of the force and the\nacceleration a = d\n2 x dt\n2 is related to the force F and mass m by\nF = cma\n(2.20)\n\nwhere the coefficient c is a universal constant with dimension Ft2M-1L-1 if\nforce, length, mass and time are all selected as base quantities. Equation\n(2.20) is a general physical law which expresses a relationship between the\nnumerical values of three different physical quantities that are involved in\nthe dynamics of a point mass--force, (gravitational) mass, and\nacceleration.\nWe are at liberty, however, to choose a force unit such that one unit of\nforce will give unit mass unit acceleration under non-relativistic\nconditions. If we do this, we make c=1 in equation (2.20) and throw\nNewton's law into the coefficient-less form\nF = ma\n(2.21)\nwhere force has a dimension MLt-2. Equation (2.21) does not imply that\nforce \"is\" in any physical sense a mass times an acceleration. The product\nof a mass times an acceleration is in fact not defined in physical terms, and\nin any case, a force can exist without there being any mass or acceleration\ninvolved, as for example when I push on an immobile brick wall (and the\nwall exerts an equal and opposite counter-force on me). In contrast with\nthe examples of area and speed, equation (2.21) does not in all cases\nprovide a recipe for directly evaluating a force by making in situ\nmeasurements of base quantities. Instead, we have imparted to force the\ncharacter of a derived quantity by making the force unit depend in a\nparticular way on the units of mass and length.\nQuantities that are transferred into the derived category by choosing a\nunit motivated by a general physical law are called derived quantities of\nthe second kind. Force is one example; heat and electric charge are also\ntreated in this way in the SI system.\n2.7 Systems of units\nA system of units is defined by\n(1) a complete set of base quantities with their defining comparison and\naddition operations,\n(2) the base units, and\n\n(3) all relevant derived quantities, expressed in terms of their defining\nequations (e.g V=dx/dt), if they are of the first kind, or the forms of the\nphysical laws that define their units (e.g. F=ma defines the force unit\nin the SI system), if they are of the second kind.\nThe set of derived quantities is open-ended; new ones may be introduced\nat will in any analysis.\nSystems of units are said to be of the same type if they differ only in\nthe magnitudes of the base units.\nIn the SI system (Systeme International) there are six base quantities\n(table 2.1): length, time, mass, temperature, current, number of elementary\nparticles, and luminous intensity. The units of length, time and mass are\nthe meter (m), the second (s) and the kilogram (kg), respectively. Force is\nmade a derived quantity by writing Newton's law as F=ma.\nThe temperature in any system of units must be a thermodynamic\ntemperature. Numbers read from an arbitrarily constructed thermometer\nscale can be used for establishing whether two temperatures are equal, but\nthey are not numerical values of a physical quantity. (Is 2oC \"twice as hot\"\nas 1oC ? Is 0oC \"zero\" temperature in the sense of there being an absence\nof temperature? For that matter, if temperature is defined in terms of a\nthermometer with an arbitrarily marked temperature scale, is there any\nreason why heat should flow from a \"higher\" to a \"lower\" temperature?)\nThe thermodynamic (or absolute) temperature is, however, defined in\nterms of physical comparison and addition operations appropriate to a base\nquantity7. Measurements via a Carnot engine or equivalent device yield\nthe ratio of two absolute temperatures; the temperature unit (i.e. the size of\nthe \"degree\") must be chosen arbitrarily. The SI temperature unit is the\nkelvin (K), which is defined as the fraction 1/273.16 of the\nthermodynamic temperature of the triple point of water.\nT\n7 The ratio of the numerical values of two physical thermodynamic temperatures T1 and\n2 can for example be defined in terms of the (physically measurable) efficiency η12of a\nCarnot engine which operates between heat reservoirs at the two temperatures. If T1 is the\ntemperature of the reservoir into which heat flows, T1/T2≡1-η12, where η12 is a pure\nnumber. This provides a physical operation for determining the ratio of the numerical\nvalues of T1 and T2, and implies a physical addition for the two quantities: if\nT2=nT1,where n=T2 /T1 , then T1+T2≡T3=(1+n)T1. The temperature T =(1+n)T1 can be\nphysically identified by noting that if a Carnot engine is run between this temperature and\nT1, it will have an efficiency n/(1+n).\n\n- - -\n- - -\n- - -\n- - -\n- - -\n- - -\nTable 2.1: The SI system of units\nBase quantities (complete set)\nQuantity\nSI name\nSI Symbol\nlength, L\nmeter\nm\ntime, t\nsecond\ns\nmass, M\nkilogram\nkg\ntemperature, T\nkelvin\nK\ncurrent, I\nampere\nA\nnumber of elementary particles\nmole\nmol\nluminous intensity\ncandela\ncd\nDerived quantities (incomplete set)\nQuantity\nDefining\nequation/law\nDimension\nDimensional\nSymbol\nName\narea\nvolume\nfrequency\nvelocity\nacceleration\ndensity\nforce\nstress/pressure\nwork/energy\ntorque\npower\nA= ∫dxdy\nV= ∫dxdydz\nf=l/τ\nv=dx/dt\na=d2x/dt2\nρ=M/V\nF=Ma\np=F/A\nW=∫Fdx\nT=Fl\ndW/dt\nL2\nL3\nt-1\nLt-1\nLt-2\nML-3\nMLt-2\nML-1 t-2\nML2t-2\nML2t-2\nML2t-3\nm2\nm3\ns -1\nms-1\nms-2\nkg m-3\nkg m s-2\nN m-2=kg m-1s-2\nN m = kg m2s-2\nN m = kg m2s-2\nJ s-1 = kg m2s-3\nhertz (Hz)\nnewton (N)\npascal (Pa)\njoule (J)\nwatt (W)\ncharge\nQ=∫ldt\nIt\nA s\ncoulomb (C)\nIn SI the electric current is adopted as a base quantity and charge is\nthrown into the derived category (via Q=∫Idt), as are all other electric and\nmagnetic quantities. The unit for current is the ampere (A), which is\n\ndefined as the current which, when passed through each of two infinite,\nparallel conductors in vacuum one meter apart, will produce a force of\n2x10-7 N per unit length on each conductor. The conventional factor 2x10-7\nis introduced for convenience and historical reasons, and appears in the SI\nversion of Ampere's law.\nThe mole unit is retained in SI as an alternative way of specifying\nnumber of things: instead of counting things one by one, one counts them\nin lots of 6.02x1023 (Avagadro's number). One must, however, specify\nwhat things one is counting, e.g. \"one mole of atoms, of molecules, of\ntennis balls\", or whatever. Note that the SI mole is in fact the old \"gram\nmole\".\nLuminous intensity does not refer to radiant energy flow per unit solid\nangle as such, which could be measured in watts per steradian, but only to\nthat portion of it to which \"the human eye\" (as defined by a standard\nresponse curve) is sensitive. At a wavelength of 555 nanometers, where\nthe human eye is most sensitive to light, one candela is equivalent to\n1.46x10-3 watt per steradian.\nAlso included sometimes among the base quantities are two\ndimensionless quantities, plane angle and solid angle, which are measured\nin radians and steradians, respectively. We consider them derived\nquantities because, though dimensionless, they are defined in terms of\noperations involving length, much like area is defined in terms of length\noperations.\nWe note again that the dimension of a derived quantity depends on the\nchoice of system of units, which is under the control of the observer and\nhas nothing to do with the quantity's intrinsic nature. Indeed, quantities\nwith quite different physical meaning, like work and torque, can have the\nsame dimension.\nThe effect of the system of units on the dimensions of quantities is\nillustrated in table 2.2, which shows the dimensions of some mechanical\nquantities in three different types of systems of units. Systems of units are\nof the same type if they have base units of the same kind but different\nmagnitude, and the derived quantities and the basic physical laws have the\nsame mathematical forms, differing only in the values of the physical\nconstants that appear in them.\nIn the first type of system illustrated in the table, length, time and mass\nare base quantities and the force unit is measured in terms of mass and\nacceleration via Newton's law in the form F=ma. The SI and the cgs\n\n(centimeter, gram, second) systems are in this category. In the second\ntype, length, time and force are base, and mass is measured via F=ma. An\nexample is the British Gravitational System, in which the base units are\nthe foot, the second and the pound-force (lbf). The pound-force is the\nforce exerted by standard gravity (32.2 ft/s2) on a standard mass sample,\nthe pound-mass (hence the term \"gravitational system\"). Mass in this\nTable 2.2: Dimensions of some mechanical quantities in different\ntypes of systems of units\nBase quantities and their dimensions in three types of system of units\nType 1\nType 2\nType 3\nBase quantities & dimensions\nL, M, t\nL, F, t\nL, M, F, t\nDimensions of some derived quantities\nvelocity = dx/dt\nLt-1\nLt-1\nLt-1\nacceleration = d2x/dt2\nLt-2\nLt-2\nLt-2\nmass\nM\nFt2L-1\nM\narea=∫dxdy\nL2\nL2\nL2\nforce\nMLt-2\nF\nF\nc=F/ma in Newton's law\nc=l\nc=l\nFM-1L-1t2\nwork = ∫Fdx\nML2t-2\nFL\nFL\nstress = F/A\nML-1t-2\nFL-2\nFL-2\nviscosity=τ/(∂u/∂y)\nML-1t-1\nFL-2t\nFL-2t\nsystem is a derived quantity with dimension Ft2L-1 and a unit (the \"slug\")\nwhich turns out to be g=32.2 times as large as the pound-mass. In the third\ntype, length, time, mass, and force are taken as base quantities, and\nNewton's law reads F=cma, where c is a physical constant with dimension\nFt2M-1L-1. The British Engineering System is an example. In this system\n\nthe base units taken are the foot, the second, the pound-mass (lbm), and\nthe pound-force (lbf), and the constant in Newton's law has the value\nc=1/32.2 lbf s2 lbm-1 ft-1.\nTable 2.2 illustrates the fact that, while an actual physical quantity like\nforce is the same regardless of the (arbitrary) choice of the system of units,\nits dimension depends on that choice. What is more, depending on how\nderived quantities are defined, a given physical law may contain a\ndimensional physical constant the value of which must be specified (as in\nF=cma), or it may contain no physical constant (as in F=ma).\nAn interesting point to note is that only a few of the available universal\nlaws are usually \"used up\" to make base quantities into derived ones of the\nsecond kind. There are many laws left with universal dimensional physical\nconstants that could in principle be set equal to unity: the gravitational\nconstant G, Planck's constant h, Boltzmann's constant kB, the speed of light\nin vacuum c, etc. This leaves us with some interesting possibilities. For\nexample, it is possible to define systems of units that have no base\nquantities at all (see Bridgman, 1931). In such systems all units of\nmeasurement are related to some of the universal constants that describe\nour universe. In effect, there exist in the universe \"natural\" units for all\nbase quantities, based on universal constants such as the speed of light, the\nquantum of energy, etc. Unfortunately, the choice of such \"natural\"\nsystems of units turns out to be far from unique, which renders futile any\nattempt to endow any one of them with unique significance.\n2.8 Recapitulation\n1. A base quantity is a property that is defined in physical terms by\ntwo operations: a comparison operation, and an addition operation. The\ncomparison operation is a physical procedure for establishing whether two\nsamples of the quantity are equal or unequal; the addition operation\ndefines what is meant by the sum of two samples of that property.\n2. Base quantities are properties for which the following concepts are\ndefined in terms of physical operations: equality, addition, subtraction,\nmultiplication by a pure number, and division by a pure number. Not\ndefined in terms of physical operations are: product, ratio, power, and\nlogarithmic, exponential, trigonometric and other special functions of\nphysical quantities.\n\n3. A base quantity can be measured in terms of an arbitrarily chosen\nunit of its own kind and a numerical value.\n4. A derived quantity of the first kind is a product of various powers of\nnumerical values of base quantities. A derived quantity is defined in terms\nof numerical value (which depends on base unit size) and does not\nnecessarily have a tangible physical representation.\n5. The dimension of any physical quantity, whether base or derived, is\na formula that defines how the numerical value of the quantity changes\nwhen the base unit sizes are changed. The dimension of a quantity does\nnot by itself provide any information on the quantity's intrinsic nature. The\nsame quantity (e.g. force) may have different dimensions in different\nsystems of units, and quantities that are clearly physically different (e.g.\nwork and torque) may have the same dimension.\n6. Relationships between physical quantities may be represented by\nmathematical\nrelationships\nbetween\ntheir\nnumerical\nvalues.\nA\nmathematical equation that correctly describes a physical relationship\nbetween quantities is dimensionally homogeneous (see section 2.5). Such\nequations remain valid when base unit sizes are changed arbitrarily.\n7. The categorization of physical quantities as either base or derived is\nto some extent arbitrary. If a particular base quantity turns out to be\nuniquely related to some other base quantities via some universal law, then\nwe can, if we so desire, use the law to redefine that quantity as a derived\nquantity of the second kind whose magnitude depends on the units chosen\nfor the others. All base quantities that are transformed into derived\nquantities in this way retain their original physical identities (i.e. their\ncomparison and addition operations), but their numerical values are\nmeasured in terms of the remaining base quantities, either directly via a\ndefining equation or indirectly by using a unit that is derivable from the\nremaining base units.\n8. A system of units is defined by (a) the base quantities, (b) their\nunits, and (c) the derived quantities, each with either its defining equation\nor the form of the physical law that has been used to cast the quantity into\nthe derived category. Both the type and the number of base quantities are\nopen to choice.\n\n3. Dimensional Analysis\nThis chapter introduces the procedure of dimensional analysis and\ndescribes Buckingham's π-theorem, which follows from it. Section 3.1\nlays down the procedure in general terms and defines the vocabulary.\nSection 3.2 gives an example, which the reader may wish to read in\nparallel with section 3.1 step by step. Section 3.3 discusses the utility of\ndimensional analysis and some of the pitfalls and questions that arise in its\napplication to real problems.\n3.1 The steps of dimensional analysis and Buckingham's\n-theorem\nThe premise of dimensional analysis is that the form of any physically\nsignificant equation must be such that the relationship between the actual\nphysical quantities remains valid independent the magnitudes of the base\nunits. Dimensional analysis derives the logical consequences of this\npremise.\nSuppose we are interested in some particular physical quantity Q0 that\nis a \"dependent variable\" in a well defined physical process or event. By\nthis we mean that, once all the quantities that define the particular process\nor event are specified, the value of Q0 follows uniquely.\nStep 1: The independent variables\nThe first and most important step in dimensional analysis is to identify a\ncomplete set of independent quantities Q1...Qn that determine the value of\nQ0,\nQ0 = f(Q1, Q2, ... , Qn).\n(3.1)\nA set Q1...Qn is complete if, once the values of the members are specified,\nno other quantity can affect the value of Q0, and independent if the value\nof each member can be adjusted arbitrarily without affecting the value of\nany other member.\nStarting with a correct set Q1...Qn is as important in dimensional\nanalysis as it is in mathematical physics to start with the correct\nfundamental equations and boundary conditions. If the starting point is\n\nwrong, so is the answer. We defer to section 3.2 the question of how a\ncorrect set is to be identified.\nThe relationship expressed symbolically in equation (3.1) is the result\nof the physical laws that govern the phenomenon of interest. It is our\npremise that its form must be such that, once the values Q1...Qn are\nspecified, the equality holds regardless of the sizes of the base units in\nterms of which the quantities are measured. The steps that follow derive\nthe consequences of this premise.\nStep 2: Dimensional considerations\nNext we list the dimensions of the dependent variable Q0 and the\nindependent variables Q1...Qn. As we have discussed, the dimension of a\nquantity depends on the type of system of units (see table 2.2), and we\nmust specify at least the type the system of units before we do this. For\nexample, if we use a system of type 1 in table 2.2 and are dealing with a\npurely mechanical problem, all quantities have dimensions of the form\n[Qi ] = L\nli M\nmit\ni\n(3.2)\nwhere the exponents li, mi and\nare dimensionless numbers that follow\ni\nfrom each quantity's definition.\nWe now pick from the complete set of physically independent\nvariables Q1...Qn a complete, dimensionally independent subset Q1...Qk\n(k n), and express the dimension of each of the remaining independent\nvariables Qk+1...Qn and the dependent variable Q0 as a product of powers of\nQ1...Qk. All physical quantities have dimensions which can be expressed\nas products of powers of the set of base dimensions. Alternatively, it is\npossible to express the dimension of one quantity as a product of powers\nof the dimensions of other quantities which are not necessarily base\nquantities. A subset Q1...Qk of the set Q1...Qn is dimensionally independent\nif none of its members has a dimension that can be expressed in terms of\nthe dimensions of the remaining members. And complete if the\ndimensions of all the remaining quantities Qk+1...Qn of the full set can be\nexpressed in terms of the dimensions of the subset Q1...Qk.\nSince equation (3.1) is dimensionally homogeneous, the dimension of\nthe dependent variable Q0 is also expressible in terms of the dimensions of\nQ1...Qk.\n\nThe dimensionally independent subset Q1...Qk is picked by trial and\nerror. Its members may be picked in different ways (see section 3.2), but\nthe number k of dimensionally independent quantities in the full set\nQ1...Qn is unique to the set, and cannot exceed the number of base\ndimensions which appear in the dimensions the quantities in that set. For\nexample, if the dimensions of Q1...Qn involve only length, mass, and time,\nthen k≤3.\nHaving chosen a complete, dimensionally independent subset Q1...Qk,\nwe express the dimensions of Q0 and the remaining quantities Qk+1...Qn in\nterms of the dimensions of Q1...Qk. These will have the form\nNik ]\n[Qi ] = [Q1\nNi 1 Q2\nNi 2 ...Qk\n(3.3)\nif i>k or i=0. The exponents Nij are dimensionless real numbers and can in\nmost cases be found quickly by inspection (see section 3.2), although a\nformal algebraic method can be used.\nThe formal procedure can be illustrated with an example where length,\nmass and time are the only base quantities, in which case all dimensions\nhave the form of equation (3.2). Let us take Q1, Q2, and Q3 as the complete\ndimensionally independent subset. Equating the dimension given by\nequation (3.2) with that of equation (3.3), we obtain three equations\nli = ∑ Nijlj\nj =1\nmi = ∑ Nijm j\n(3.4)\nj =1\nti =∑ Nijtj\nj =1\nwhich can be solved for the three unknowns Ni1, Ni2, and Ni3.\n\nStep 3: Dimensionless variables\nWe now define dimensionless forms of the n-k remaining independent\nvariables by dividing each one with the product of powers of Q1...Qk\nwhich has the same dimension,\nQk +i\nN( k+i ) k ,\n(3.5)\nΠi =\nN(k +i )1 Q2\nN(k +i ) 2...Qk\nQ1\nwhere i=1, 2,..., n-k, and a dimensionless form of the dependent variable\nQ0,\n(3.6)\nΠ0 = Q1\nN01 Q2\nN\nQ\n...Qk\nN 0 k\n.\nStep 4: The end game and Buckingham's -theorem\nAn alternative form of equation (3.1) is\n= f(Q1,Q2, ...., Qk;\n1,\n2 , ...,\nn-k)\n(3.7)\nin which all quantities are dimensionless except Q1...Qk. The values of the\ndimensionless quantities are independent of the sizes of the base units. The\nvalues of Q1...Qk, on the other hand, do depend on base unit size. They\ncannot be put into dimensionless form since they are (by definition)\ndimensionally independent of each other. From the principle that any\nphysically meaningful equation must be dimensionally homogeneous, that\nis, valid independent of the sizes of the base units, it follows that Q1...Qk\nmust in fact be absent from equation (3.7), that is,\n= f( 1,\n2 , ...,\nn-k) .\n(3.8)\nThis equation is the final result of the dimensional analysis, and\ncontains\n\nBuckingham's\n-theorem:\nWhen a complete relationship between dimensional physical\nquantities is expressed in dimensionless form, the number of\nindependent quantities that appear in it is reduced from the original\nn to n-k, where k is the maximum number of the original n that are\ndimensionally independent.\nThe theorem derives its name from Buckingham's use of the symbol\nfor\nthe dimensionless variables in his original 1914 paper. The π-theorem tells\nus that, because all complete physical equations must be dimensionally\nhomogeneous, a restatement of any such equation in an appropriate\ndimensionless form will reduce the number of independent quantities in\nthe problem by k. This can simplify the problem enormously, as will be\nevident from the example that follows.\nThe π-theorem itself merely tells us the number of dimensionless\nquantities that affect the value of a particular dimensionless dependent\nvariable. It does not tell us the forms of the dimensionless variables. That\nhas to be discovered in the third and fourth steps described above. Nor\ndoes the π-theorem, or for that matter dimensional analysis as such, say\nanything about the form of the functional relationship expressed by\nequation (3.7). That form has to be discovered by experimentation or by\nsolving the problem theoretically.\n3.2 An example: Deformation of an elastic ball striking a wall\nSuppose we wish to investigate the deformation that occurs in elastic balls\nwhen they impact on a wall. We might be interested, for example, in\nfinding out what determines the diameter d of the circular imprint left on\nthe wall after a freshly dyed ball has rebounded from it (figure 3.1).\nStep 1: The independent variables\nThe first step is to identify a complete set of independent quantities that\ndetermine the imprint radius d. We begin by specifying the problem more\nclearly. We agree to restrict our attention to (initially) spherical,\nhomogeneous balls made of perfectly elastic material, to impacts at\nperpendicular to the wall, and to walls that are perfectly smooth and flat\n\nand so stiff and heavy that they do not deform or move during the impact\nprocess. We also agree to adopt a system of units of type 1 in table 2.2,\nlike the SI system.\nFig. 3.1: A freshly dyed elastic ball leaving imprint after impact with rigid wall.\nThe numerical value of a dependent variable like d will be depend on\nthe values of all quantities that distinguish one impact event from another.\nExperience suggests that these should include at least the following: the\nball's diameter D and velocity V just prior to contact (the initial\nconditions) and its mass m. The ball's intrinsic material properties will\nalso play a role. Our theoretical understanding of solid mechanics tells us\nthat the quasi-static response of a perfectly elastic material is characterized\nby two material properties, the modulus of elasticity E and Poisson's ratio\n, and that the inertial effects which inevitably come into play during\ncollision and rebound will also depend on the material's density . The\nproperties of the wall are irrelevant if it is indeed perfectly rigid, as we\nassumed. We know, however, by thinking of how the problem would have\nto be set up as a theoretical one, that the answer for the numerical value d\nwill also depend on the values of all universal constants that appear in the\nphysical laws that control the ball's impact dynamics. In this case the\nprocess is governed by Newton's law of motion and the law of mass\nconservation. Having chosen a system of units of type 1 in table 2.2, we\nknow that Newton's law has the form F=ma and contains no universal\n\nconstants8. Nor are there any physical constants in the law of mass\nconservation.\nWe seem to arrive at the conclusion that d depends on six quantities:\nD, V, m, E,\n. This is a complete set, as required, but not an independent\nset: once the ball's mass and diameter are specified, its density follows.\nWe must therefore exclude either the density or the mass. (Other quantities\nlike V2 , DE1/2, etcetera, all involving quantities that affect the value of d,\nare excluded for the same reason: they are not independent of the\nquantities already included.) We conclude that the following relationship\nexpresses the impact diameter in terms of a complete set of independent\nvariables:\nd = d(V,\n(3.9)\n, D, E, ).\nNote that the choice of a complete, independent set for a specified\nproblem is not unique except for the number n of its members (n=5 in this\ncase). One could just as well have chosen V2, , D, E, and\nD, E,\n, say, or V, m,\n--see section 3.3. It should also be noted that further assumptions\nhave been taken for granted in equation (3.9). We have presumed, for\nexample, that the ball's motion is unaffected by the properties of the fluid\nthrough which it approaches the wall (which is certainly OK if the ball\nmoves through vacuum and a good approximation in air, but may not\napply to small balls in viscous liquids), and that gravitational effects play a\nnegligible role. See the discussion in section 3.3.\nStep 2: Dimensional considerations\nIn the type of system of units we have adopted in step 1, the\ndimensions of the quantities in equation (3.9) are:\nindependent:\n[V]=Lt-1\n[ ]=ML-3\n[D]=L\n(3.10)\n[E]=ML-1t-2\n[ ]=1\n8 If, on the other hand, we had decided to use a system of type 3 in Table 2.1, the value of\nthe dimensional constant c=F/ma for the chosen system of units would have to be\nspecified, and would affect the value of d.\n\ndependent:\n[d]=L\nInspection of the above shows that the three quantities V, , and D, for\nexample, comprise a complete, dimensionally independent subset of the\nfive independent variables. The dimension of any one of these three\ncannot be made up of the dimensions of the other two. The dimensions of\nthe remaining independent variables E and and the dependent variable d\ncan, however, be made up of those of V, and D as follows:\n-2\nindependent:\n[E] = ML\n-1t\n= (ML\n-3)(Lt)\n2 = [ V\n2]\n[ ] = 1\n(3.11)\ndependent:\n[d] = L = [D]\nWe have written down these results very simply by inspection.\nAccomplished practitioners seldom use the formal algebraic method of\nsection 3.1. Note again that the dimension of a dimensionless quantity like\nis unity, the factor by which dimensionless numbers change when the\nsizes of the base units are changed.\nStep 3: Dimensionless similarity parameters\nWe non-dimensionalize the remaining independent variables E and and\nthe dependent variable d by dividing them by\nV\n2, D, and unity,\nrespectively, as suggested by equation (3.11):\nED3\nindependent:\nΠ1 = mV\nΠ2 =\n(3.12)\ndependent:\nΠ0 = d\nD\n\nStep 4: The end game\nUsing the logic that led to Buckingham's π-theorem, we now conclude\nthat\nΠ = f (Π1,Π2),\no\nor\nd\n⎛ E\n⎞⎟ .\n(3.13)\n= f ⎜\nV\n2 , ⎠\nD\n⎝\nThe number of independent variables has been reduced from the original\nn=5 that define the problem to n-k =2.\n3.3 On the utility of dimensional analysis, and some difficulties and\nquestions that arise in its application\nSimilarity\nDimensional analysis provides a similarity law for the phenomenon under\nconsideration. Similarity in this context implies a certain equivalence\nbetween two physical phenomena that are actually different. The collisions\nof two different elastic spheres 1 and 2 with a rigid wall, each with its own\nvalues of V, , D, E, and\nunder particular conditions where the parameters of the two events are\nsuch that\n, may appear to be quite different. However,\n1 and\n2 have the same values, that is, where\nE1\nE2\n=\n2V2\n1V1\n(3.14)\n2 =\n1,\nequation (3.13) informs us that\n0 has the same value in both cases, that\nis,\nd1\nd2 =\n.\n(3.15)\nD2\nD1\n\nWhen the relationships in equation (3.14) apply, the two dynamic events\nare similar in the sense of equation (3.15).\nOut-of-scale modeling\nScale modeling deals with the following question: If we want to learn\nsomething about the performance of a full-scale system 1 by testing a\ngeometrically similar small-scale system model 2 (or vice-versa, if the\nsystem of interest inaccessibly small), at what conditions should we test\nthe model, and how should we obtain the full-scale performance from\nmeasurements at the small scale? Dimensional analysis provides the\nanswer.\nSuppose we need to know the deformation diameter of a huge, soft\nrubber ball with a diameter D of 5 meters and properties E1,\nand , as\n,\nit hits the pavement with a speed V2 of 10 m/s, but are unable to compute it\nfrom basic principles. In that case we need only perform one small-scale\ntest with a model 2 of diameter D2, selecting its properties and test\nconditions such that equations (3.14) are satisfied, and measure its imprint\ndiameter d2. The full-scale value d1 of the big ball's imprint diameter at its\n\"design conditions\" can then be obtained from equation (3.15).\nDimensional analysis reduces the number of variables and minimizes\nwork\nDimensional analysis reduces the number of variables that must be\nspecified to describe an event. This often leads to an enormous\nsimplification. In our example of the impacting ball the answer depends on\nfive independent variables (equation 3.9), that is, a particular event may be\nrepresented as a distribution of d defined in a five-dimensional space of\nindependent variables. Suppose we set out to obtain the answer in a certain\nregion (a certain volume) of this variable-space, by either computation or\nexperimentation, and decide that 10 data points will be required in each\nvariable, with the other four being held constant. This would require\nobtaining 105 data points. Dimensional analysis, however, shows us that in\ndimensionless form the answer depends only on two similarity parameters.\nThis two-dimensional space can be explored with similar resolution with\nonly 102 data points, that is, with 0.1% of the effort.\n\nFigure 3.2: Experimental data of d/D vs E/ρV2 for γ=0.3 and γ=0.5.\nFigure 3.2: Plot of \"experimental data\" in dimensionless form.\nTable 3.1 shows some \"experimental data\" for impacts with balls of\nthree materials and various values of impact velocity.

Fig. 3.2 shows these data as a plot of d/D vs. E/ρV2 with γ as a\nparameter. The simulated \"experimental scatter\" in Fig. 3.2 actually\nresults from the coarseness of the computational grid. Disregarding the\nscatter, all points fall essentially on a common curve, as predicted by\ndimensional analysis. The influence of the Poisson's ratio turns out to be\nvirtually negligible, given the scatter, and all the data may be curve-fitted\nV\nwith an equation of the form d / D = f (E /\n).\nAn incomplete set of independent quantities may destroy the analysis\nAssuming competence on the part of the analyst, the correctness of the\ndimensional analysis will depend entirely on whether a complete set of\nindependent quantities Q1...Qn is in fact properly identified in step 1. Any\ncomplete set will yield correct results. If, however, the analysis is based on\na set which omits even one independent quantity that affects the value of\nQo, dimensional analysis will give erroneous results.\nSuppose that in our example we had omitted the sphere's modulus of\nelasticity E in equation (3.9). Instead of equation (3.13), we would then\nhave obtained the absurd result\nd = f ( ),\n(3.16)\nD\nwhich implies that the maximum deformation depends on the ball's\nPoisson ratio, but is independent of its elasticity, mass and approach\nvelocity! This single error of omission is clearly fatal to the analysis.\nSuperfluous independent quantities complicate the result unnecessarily\nErrors on the side of excess have a less traumatic effect. Over-\nspecification of independent variables does not destroy the analysis, but\nrobs it of its power. For every superfluous independent quantity included\nin the set, there will be in the final dimensionless relationship a\nsuperfluous dimensionless similarity parameter.\nSuppose we argue (quite reasonably!) that the ball's deformation upon\nimpact will in general also depend on the local gravitational acceleration g\n(which we assume to be in the direction into the wall on which the impact\noccurs). This would change equation (3.13) to\n\nd\n⎛ E\ngD⎞\nD = f ⎜\n⎝ V\n2 , ,\n⎟\n(3.17)\nV 2 ⎠\nwhere\ndeformation is in fact insensitive to gravity, as we implicitly assumed\nearlier, equation (3.17) is \"wrong\" only in the sense that it suggests a\ndependence on g that is not noticeably there, and thus unnecessarily\ncomplicates our thinking. If by experimentation or computation we\neventually discover that there exists a broad range of conditions where the\nsimilarity parameter involving g has in fact no measurable effect on d/D,\nand that the conditions of interest fall into this range6, we omit the\nparameter involving g and arrive at the same simpler conclusion as before,\nbut only after due payment in effort for our lack of insight.\n2 is a dimensionless gravity. Under conditions where the\ngD V\nOn the importance of simplifying assumptions\nThe previous example illustrates an important point about most problems\nin dimensional analysis: Completeness in the set of independent variables\nis not an absolute matter, but depends on how we choose to circumscribe\nthe problem. It is quite conceivable, for example, that there are \"balls\"\nwhose deformation upon impact with a wall is gravity-dependent. This\nwould be the case for balls with such low coefficient of elasticity, or large\ndiameter, or low impact velocity, that their deformation at rest on a wall in\nthe gravitational field would be significant compared with their\ndeformation upon impact. When we say \"the deformation does not depend\non gravity\", we imply that we know with some confidence that there exist\nconditions where this is true, and choose to confine our attention to those\nconditions.\nIf dimensional analysis depended on a truly complete identification of\nthe independent variables that specify a given physical event, we would in\nmost cases be reduced to impotence. Those familiar with the theory of\nchaos and the mechanics of many-body systems may sympathize with the\nview that the wind at a certain street corner in New York, say, may in\n6 To prove this with earthbound experimentation one would have to demonstrate that d/D\nremains constant when m, D and/or V are changed so as to vary gD/V2 while keeping\nED3/mV2 constant.\n\nsome measure have been affected by the wing-beat of a butterfly in Brazil\na month earlier. This kind of fastidiousness elicits a shrug from the\npragmatist, who proceeds with a problem by saying: \"Based on my\nexperience as a scientist and engineer, I argue that this event should be\ncontrolled by the following complete set of independent variables.\nAssuming tentatively that I am correct, what does dimensional analysis\ntell me?\"\nOn choosing a complete set of independent variables\nGiven what has been said above, how does one go about choosing a\ncomplete set of independent variables that define a particular problem?\nIf we know the mathematical forms of all the equations and boundary\n(and initial) conditions that completely specify a particular type of process\nor event, one can deduce from them a complete set of independent\nparameters that define the event. This we do by simply examining all the\nequations and listing all the quantities whose values would have to be\nspecified to define a particular event through all time. The set may include\nposition and time, if the variable of interest depends on them, universal\nphysical constants (e.g. gravitational constant, universal gas constant R,\netc.), material properties (e.g. density, E, etc.) and all other quantities that\nappear not only in the equations but also in the boundary and initial\nconditions that determine the answer to the particular problem at hand.\nThe last point is not as straightforward as it sounds: the question of what\nconstitutes a well-posed mathematical problem is often difficult to answer\nin non-linear systems.\nIf the equations and boundary conditions are not well known, as for\nexample when one is trying to use dimensional analysis to help correlate\nexperimental data for a complex phenomenon that is not well understood,\none has to proceed by trial and error based on an (educated) guess about\nthe physics of the problem at hand. Support for the analysis (and thus for\nthe guess about the physics) may be obtained a posteriori by showing that\nall experimental data can indeed be accurately correlated in the\ndimensionless form suggested by the analysis. There should be sufficient\ndata to be able to show that one has neither missed an important quantity\nnor included one that is irrelevant.\n\nThe result is independent of how one chooses a dimensionally independent\nsubset\nSuppose we had chosen the dimensionally independent subset V, E, and\ninstead of V, D and . Non-dimensionalizing d and D with combinations\nof V, E and , we might have obtained the result\nd\n( V\n2 / E)\n1/3 = F\nD\n(mV\n2 / E)\n1 / 3,\n⎛\n⎝\n⎜\n⎞\n⎠\n(3.18)\nThis can, however, be rewritten as\nd\nD = mV2\nED\n⎛\n⎝\n⎜\n⎞\n⎠\n1 / 3\nF\nED3\nmV\n⎛\n⎝\n⎜\n⎞\n⎠\n1 / 3\n,\n⎛\n⎝\n⎜\n⎞\n⎠\n⎟ = f ED3\nmV\n2 ,\n⎛\n⎝\n⎜\n⎞\n⎠\n(3.19)\nwhere F and f are different functions of their arguments. Equation (3.19) is\nof course identical to equation (3.13).\nThe result is independent of the type of system of units\nThe choice of system of units may affect the dimensions of physical\nquantities as well as the values of the physical constants that appear in the\nunderlying physical laws. What effect, if any, does this have on\ndimensional analysis? Reason dictates there should be no effect on the\n\"bottom line\", since the observer (the analyst) is free to choose or make up\nwhatever system of units he wants, and his arbitrary choice should not\naffect the laws of physics.\nConsider our example of the dyed ball, but viewed in terms of a\nsystem of units like the British Engineering System (type3 in table 2.2),\nwhere mass, length, time and force are taken as base units. In such a\nsystem Newton's law reads F= cma, where c is a physical constant with\ndimension Ft2m-1 L-1. This affects the very first step of the analysis. Since\nthe impact process is controlled by Newton's law, which now contains the\nconstant c, the value of which must be specified, we now have\nd = d(V ,D, E,m, ,c).\n(3.20)\n\nThe number of independent variable (n=6) has increased by one. The\ndimensions of the variable are now:\nindependent:\n[V]=Lt-1\n[D]=L\n[E]=FL-2\n(3.21)\n[m]=M\n[ ]=0\n[c]=Ft2M-1L-1\ndependent:\n[d]=L\nThe quantities V, D, m and c comprise a convenient dimensionally\nindependent subset. The number of this subset has also increased by one\n(k=4). The dimensions of the remaining quantities can be expressed in\nterms of these four as\n[d]=[D]\n[E]=[cV2D-3]\n(3.22)\n[ ]=0\nand the final result of the analysis is\nd = f\n⎛⎜ ED\n⎞⎟\n(3.23)\nD\n⎝ cmV 2 , ⎠\nThis differs from our previous result, equation (3.13), only in that the\nphysical constant c appears in the non-dimensionalization of E. Equations\n(3.13) and (3.23) are, however, functionally identical. Since n-k=2 in both\ncases, both analyses imply that d/D depends on two dimensionless\nparameters, and a dimensionless E. It is just that in the second system of\nunits, E must be non-dimensionalized with cmV2/D3 instead of mV2/D3 ,\nsince the latter no longer has the same dimension as E. In short, the forms\nof some of the dimensional parameters may change with the system of\nunits, but the physical content of analysis remains invariant. This is, of\ncourse, as we expected; the choice of system of units is arbitrary, and\nshould not affect the physical \"bottom line.\"\n\n4. Dimensional Analysis in Problems where Some\nIndependent Quantities Have Fixed Values\nEngineering practice often involves problems where some of the quantities\nthat define the problem have the same fixed values in all the applications\nbeing considered. As a simple example, suppose we are interested in\ndetermining the hydrodynamic drag force D on a fully submerged, very\nlong, neutrally buoyant cable being dragged behind a ship, and propose to\ndo this by making small scale experiments in a water tunnel. Basic fluid\nmechanics tells us that, barring surface roughness effects, the drag force\nshould be completely determined by the cable's length L and diameter d,\nthe ship's (or water's) velocity V, and the water's density\nand viscosity\n. Three of these five quantities are dimensionally independent, and\ndimensional analysis (or Buckingham's pi-theorem) tells us that an\nappropriately defined dimensionless drag is a function of n-k=2\ndimensionless similarity parameters. One way of writing this relationship\nis\nD\nV 2L2 = f Re, d\nL\n⎛\n⎝\n⎞\n⎠\n(4.1)\nwhere\nRe = VL\n4.2)\nis a Reynolds number based on cable length and d/L is the cable's\n\"fineness coefficient,\" which defines its geometry. Equation (4.1) is a\ngeneral relationship for the cable-towing problem as stated.\nWe observe, however, that the density and viscosity have essentially\nthe same values⎯those of sea water at its typical temperature⎯in all the\napplications that are of interest. The number of quantities that actually\nvary from case to case are thus actually three, not five.\nThe question arises, does this lead to a simplification of the similarity\nlaw expressed by equation (4.1), that is, to a reduction in the number of\nindependent similarity parameters? Simply omitting the quantities that\nhave fixed values and performing dimensional analysis on the rest cannot\n\nanswer this question9. Dimensional analysis must be based on a complete\nset of independent quantities that determine the quantity of interest. All the\nquantities whose values determine the quantity of interest must be\nincluded, regardless of whether some of them happen to be the same\nvalues in the problems that are of interest. As we have seen in section 3,\nomitting even one independent variable can fatally damage the analysis.\nThe general question is the following: What reduction, if any, can be\nobtained in the number of similarity parameters if a certain number of the\nindependent quantities that define the problem always have the same fixed\nvalues? This can be answered by the following analysis.\nSuppose we are interested in a quantity Q that is completely\ndetermined by the values of n independent quantities Qi, of which nF are\nheld at fixed values in all the cases that concern us. Let the quantities that\nmay vary be the first (n-nF) of Qi, and designate the nF quantities with\nfixed values by Fi:\nQ = f (Q1,Q2,..,Qn- nF ;F1,F2,..,FkF ,FkF +1,FkF +2,.., F )\n(4.3)\nnF\nChoose a complete, dimensionally independent subset of the set Fi. Let\nthese be the first kF of the fixed set, as indicated in equation (4.3). Using\nthis subset, non-dimensionalize the remaining (nF-kF) fixed quantities and\nwrite the relationship (4.3) in the alternative form\n∗\n∗\n∗\nQ = f (Q1,Q2,...,Qn- nF ;F1,F2,...,FkF ,F ,F ,..., FnF )\n(4.4)\nk+1\nk +1\nwhere the asterisked indicate dimensionless quantities involving only\nquantities with fixed values. These dimensionless quantities thus have the\nsame fixed values in the cases that concern us. For these cases, therefore,\nwe can write (4.4) as\nQ = f (Q1,Q2,...,Qn- nF ;F1,F2,...,FkF )\n(4.5)\nThe value of Q is thus completely determined by a set of n-nF+kF\nindependent quantities consisting of those dependent quantities that are\n9 Were we to simply omit the density and viscosity in the present problem, for example,\nwe would imply a relationship D=f(L,h,V) which is not dimensionally homogeneous and\ntherefore unacceptable. (There is no way of writing the dimension of force in terms of\njust length and velocity).\n\nnot fixed plus the dimensionally independent subset of the fixed\nquantities.\nNow perform dimensional analysis on the relationship in equation\n(4.5). First, select from the set of n-nF+kF independent quantities in\nequation (4.5) a complete, dimensionally independent subset of k\nquantities. Let this subset be the first k of the quantities. Since equation\n(4.5) contains all the variable independent quantities plus the\ndimensionally independent subset of the fixed (independent) quantities,\nthe subset we thus obtain is also complete, dimensionally independent\nsubset for the whole original set of n quantities.\nAccording to equation (4.5), Q depends on n-nF+kF independent\nvariables, of which k are independent. Dimensional analysis thus yields\nthe result\n∗\nQ = f (Π1,Π2,...,ΠN )\n(4.6)\nwhere\nN = (n - k) - (nF - kF ) .\n(4.7)\nWe have arrived at the following theorem:\nTheorem\nIf a quantity Q is completely determined by a set of n\nindependent quantities, of which k are dimensionally\nindependent, and if nF of these quantities have fixed values in\nall the cases being considered, a number kF of these being\ndimensionally independent, then a suitable dimensionless Q\nwill be completely determined by (n-k)-(nF-kF) dimensionless\nsimilarity parameters.\nIn other words, the fact that a number nF of the quantities always have\nfixed values reduces the number of independent similarity parameters by\n(nF-kF). This theorem is a generalization of Buckingham's\n-theorem, and\nreduces to it when nF=0.\nReturning to the cable-towing example, in which nF=2 and kF=2, we\nnow see immediately that no gain in similarity (no reduction in the number\nof similarity parameters) accrues from the fact that the viscosity and\n\ndensity are essentially the same in all the applications that interest us. The\nsimilarity law equation (4.1) cannot be simplified.\nSimplification occurs only when some of the fixed quantities are\ndimensionally dependent on the rest.\n\nCited References\nBarenblatt, G.

      "content": "10/25/99\nR. D. Kamm\nPage 1\nDerivation of the Viscous Flow Equations\nTo obtain the equation for viscous-dominated (inertial-free) flow, we need to start\nwith the local force balance in the fluid, which is the same expression we used previously\nin a solid,\n∂τ ij = 0\n(1)\n∂xi\nwhere τij is the stress tensor and the subscripts i,j denote the direction of the normal\nvector corresponding to the surface on which the stress acts and the component of the\nstress, respectively.\nNext, we need to define an appropriate constitutive law for the fluid, analogous to\nHooke's law for a solid. Here, however, an important distinction must be made. A solid,\nwhen subjected to a steady shear stress, deforms an amount proportional to the applied\nstress, then remains fixed in that deformed configuration. A fluid, on the other hand,\nwhen subjected to a steady shear stress, continues to deform, and the rate of shear\ndeformation (rather than its magnitude) depends upon the level of applied stress. Hence,\nwe need a constitutive law of a different form wherein the stresses are related to the rate\nof deformation rather than to the deformation itself.\nU\nFor now, we restrict our attention to a Newtonian fluid, one in which the stress\nand rate of deformation are linearly related. We first need to define the rates of\ndeformation, which, as might be expected, are related to the velocity field within the\nfluid, vi. In the 1-2 plane, a simple shearing deformation is shown in Fig. 1 in which the\n\nR. D. Kamm\n10/25/99\nPage 2\nfluid, contained between two plates, is sheared by the action of a steady force per unit\narea τ21 to the right. If we take the bottom plate to be stationary (u1=0), then the upper\nplate moves to the right at a speed U and the velocity profile in the fluid is found (e.g., by\nexperiment) to be linear with x2. We define a Newtonian fluid as one in which the rate of\ndeformation or the strain rate, dγdt, is linearly related to the applied stress so that\ndγ\nτ21 ∝\n(2)\ndt\nFrom geometry, it can be seen that\ndγ = dv1\n(3)\ndt\ndx2\nso that we can rewrite (2) as an equality by introducing the constant of proportionality\nwhich we call the coefficient of viscosity, μ,\nτ21 = μ dv1\n(4)\ndx2\nFor many common fluids (e.g., air, water) μ is independent of the shear rate γ, and is\ntermed Newtonian. Fluids for which the viscosity varies with dγ/dt are referred to as non-\nNewtonian. Generalizing eqn. (4) to three dimensions, we have:\n⎞\nτ\n∂vj\nij = μ\n⎛\n⎜\n∂vi + ∂xi ⎠⎟\nfor i=j\n(5)\n⎝∂xj\nwhere you should note the strong similarity to Hooke's law for a solid where strain, rather\nthan strain rate, is constitutively related to stress. It will become clear below why we\nhave restricted this equation to cases i=j.\nBefore introducing this into eqn. (1), we need to take into account the fact that a\nuniform normal stress (i.e., a hydrostatic pressure) does not produce any motion in the\nfluid. We therefore define the deviatoric stress that essentially represents that stress with\nthe hydrostatic component separated out. The deviatoric stress is denoted as τ' and is\nrelated to the pressure and total stress through the equation:\n⎛∂vi\n⎞\nτ\n+\n(6)\nτij = -pδ ij + ′ij = -pδ ij + μ\n⎝⎜∂x j\n∂vj ⎟\n∂xi ⎠\n\nR. D. Kamm\n10/25/99\nPage 3\nThe nine components of deviatoric stress comprise the deviatoric stress tensor. Note that\nthe pressure p is defined as the mean of the three normal stresses:\nτ11 + τ22 + τ33\n(7)\np =\nNow, when we combine the overall force balance equation (1) with equation (6),\nwe obtain:\n∇p = μ∇\n2V\n(8)\nwith V = v1i1 + v2i2 + v3i3. This is often called the Stokes Equation.\nWhen we use the Stokes Equation, we will typically make use of only one\ncomponent of the vector equation. For example, we can write, in the x1 direction:\n∂p\n⎛∂v1\n∂v1\n∂v1 ⎞\n∂xi\n= μ⎜\n2 +\n2 +\n2 ⎟\n(9)\n⎝∂x1\n∂x2\n∂x3 ⎠\nOr, expressing (8) in cylindrical coordinates, the axial component for axisymmetric flow,\nis:\n∂p\n⎡1 ∂⎛ ∂vz ⎞⎤\n(10)\n= μ⎢\n∂z\n⎣r ∂r ⎝r ∂r ⎠⎦⎥\nwhere we have also assumed the flow to be fully-developed, i.e., not varying in the axial\n(z) direction."
