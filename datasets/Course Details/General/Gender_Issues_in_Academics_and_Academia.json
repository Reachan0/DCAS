  "syllabus_content": "Course Meeting Times\n\nLectures: 1 session / week, 2 hours / session\n\nFormat\n\nThis course, as part of the\nExperimental Study Group\nSeminar Series, offers students the opportunity to participate in a small discussion-based class taught by an MIT upperclassman under the guidance of a faculty supervisor. Students Laurel Ruhlen (B.S. 06 Physics) and Kayla Jacobs (B.S. 06 Physics, 07 Mathematics) taught this seminar in cooperation with Dr. Holly Sweet, Lecturer and Associate Director of the Experimental Study Group. Seminars taught in this format are all graded Pass/Fail and receive 1/2 of the academic credit assigned to regular academic classes.\n\nCourse Description\n\nDoes it matter in education whether or not you've got a Y chromosome? You bet it does. In this discussion-based seminar, we will explore why males vastly outrank females in math and science and career advancements (particularly in academia), and why girls get better grades and go to college more often than boys. Do the sexes have different learning styles? Are women denied advanced opportunities in academia and the workforce? How do family life and family decisions affect careers for both men and women?\n\nWhile much of the material will deal with the issues of girls and women in academics, boys' experiences will also be addressed. We will also briefly investigate the effects of race and general societal pressures on these issues, and how MIT specifically is addressing gender concerns in its educational and research programs.\n\nClass Structure\n\nThe class will meet for two hours once per week. The seminar is almost entirely discussion-based, guided by the readings assigned for that class.\n\nReadings\n\nEach week will have 25-50 pages of reading to be completed before class. A number of the selections, especially early in the semester, will come from two excellent books:\n\nSadker, Myra, and David Sadker.\nFailing at Fairness\n. New York, NY: Scribner, 1995. ISBN: 9780684800738.\n\nJossey-Bass Publishers.\nThe Jossey-Bass Reader on Gender in Education\n. San Francisco, CA: Jossey-Bass, 2002. ISBN: 9780787960742.\n\nOthers readings will be provided as photocopies or online links. Unless you're using a library book, do mark up the pages with underlining, highlighting, and notes in the margins. Students are encouraged to suggest interesting supplemental topics and readings to the class.\n\nWriting Assignments\n\nJot down your initial thoughts and reactions and questions after each reading (try to include the page number that prompted your idea, so that it can be easily referred to during the discussion). Come with at least one open-ended discussion question every week - something you found particularly interesting, or surprising. Your journal will not be graded or even looked at (unless you'd like the instructors to give you feedback); it's for your own recordings of your thoughts, though you will need to draw from your notes during class discussions.\n\nGrading Policy\n\nThis seminar is graded P/D/F. You will be expected to complete all the assigned readings before class, use your journal regularly, and participate fully and thoughtfully in the discussions. Because the discussion element of the course is so integral, you may miss at most two class sessions; please inform your instructors ahead of time if possible, and let them know if there are any special circumstances.",

New York: Doubleday\n(1994). ISBN: 0385425759.\n(2) FAF chapter 3: \"Missing in Interaction.\"\nDiscussion notes:\n(1) Orenstein: \"Learning Silence\"\n- \"Amy walks to the far side of the room and, as she takes her seat, falls into a typically\nfeminine pose: she crosses her legs, folds her arms across her chest, and hunches forward\ntoward her desk, seeming to shrink into herself. The sauciness of the playground\ndisappears, and, in fact, she says hardly a word during class. Meanwhile, the boys,\nespecially those who are more physically mature, sprawl in their chairs, stretching their\nlegs long, expanding into the available space\" (p.7).\n- \"When the girls... do speak, they follow the rules... When Amy volunteers her sole answer\nof the period, she raises her hand, too. She gives the wrong answer to an easy\nmultiplication problem, turns crimson, and flips her head forward so her hair falls over her\nface. Occasionally, the girls shout out answers, but generally they are the easiest, lowest-\nrisk questions, such as the factors of four or six. And their stabs at public recognition\ndepend on the boys' largesse; when the girls venture responses to more complex questions\nthe boys quickly become territorial, shouting them down with their own answers... [The\nteacher] doesn't say anything to condone the boys' aggressiveness, but she doesn't have to:\nthey insist on--and receive--her attention even when she consciously tries to shift it\nelsewhere in order to make the class more equitable.\" (p. 9).\n- \"I don't raise my hand in my classes because I'm afraid I have the wrong answer and I'll\nbe embarrassed\" (p.11).\n- Classroom interactions as power struggles.\n(2) Failing at Fairness: \"Missing in Interaction\"\n- To preserve order, most teachers use established classroom conventions such as raising\nyour hand if you want to talk. Intellectually, teachers know they should apply this rule\nconsistently, but when the discussion becomes fast-paced and furious, the rule is often\nswept aside. When this happens and shouting out begins, it is an open invitation for male\ndominance. Our research shows that boys call out significantly more often than girls.\n\nMIT ES.242 \"Gender Issues in Academics and Academia\" (Spring 2004) - Laurel Ruhlen & Kayla Jacobs\nSometimes what they say has little or nothing to do with the teacher's questions. Whether\nmale comments are insightful or irrelevant, teachers respond to them. However, when girls\ncall out, there is a fascinating occurrence: Suddenly the teacher remembers the rule about\nraising your hand before you talk. And then the girl, who is usually not as assertive as the\nmale students, is deftly and swiftly put back in her place. Not being allowed to call out like\nher male classmates... will not psychologically scar [her]; however, the system of silencing\noperates covertly and repeatedly. It occurs several times a day during each school week for\ntwelve years, and even longer if [she] goes to college, and, most insidious of all, it happens\nsubliminally. This micro-inequity eventually has a powerful cumulative impact\" (Failing\nat Fairness pp. 43-44).\n- \"On the surface, girls appear to be doing well. They get better grades and receive fewer\npunishments than boys... Reinforced for passivity... As victims of benign neglect, girls are\npenalized for doing what they should\" (Failing at Fairness p. 44).\n- \"When we videotape classrooms and play back the tapes, most teachers are stunned to see\nthemselves teaching subtle gender lessons along with math and spelling.\" (Failing at\nFairness p. 46)\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\nES.242 Gender Issues in Academics and Academia\nSpring 2004\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

(AAUW p. 294)\n- Have you heard of the issue of boys' underenrollment in language and arts classes before?\nHas it struck you as a \"problem\" like girls' underenrollment in physics?\n- Boys and girls are approximately equally represented in the social sciences and APs.\n- Remedial classes and tracking: Good or bad?\no Good for gifted, not for others?\no Is it helpful for slower students, or does it just hold them back?\no Is it the responsibility of the schools to provide for the extremes of the bell curve?\nThe state?\n- Girls identified more than boys in gifted programs in elementary school, but they drop out:\nwhy?\no Suggestions: Geek stereotypes, fitting in, etc.\n- \"U.S. culture often equates higher expenditure of effort with lower ability\" (AAUW p.\n291). What does this say about boys (who often assume/say their success is due to ability)\nand girls (who often assume/say their success is due to effort)? Does this stereotype ring\ntrue? Could girls' efforts be to compensate for lower ability, or perhaps to give the\nimpression of lower ability so as not to be \"too smart\"? (\"Oh, I just studied really hard for\nthat test; it's not that I'm a math genius\"--and thus geeky and unattractive.)\n\nMIT ES.242 \"Gender Issues in Academics and Academia\" (Spring 2004) - Laurel Ruhlen & Kayla Jacobs\n(2) Fine: Sex Education\n- \"Adolescent sexuality â†’ victimization and danger\" theme.\n- \"Sex-negative attitudes do not discourage sexual activity, but they do discourage\nresponsible use of contraception. Teens who believe sexual involvement is wrong deny\nresponsibility for contraception. To accept responsibility would legitimate 'bad' behavior\"\n(Fine p. 377).\n- Personal experience: 9th grade \"Life Skills\" class video on rape had only female victims of\nmale aggressors depicted.\no What does this portrayal say to boys who don't/won't rape?\no What about male victims of rape? (More of 'em than you might think! Though\nstill much smaller than the number of female victims.)\n- Don't get into an argument about abstinence education: rather, focus on academic effects\n(pregnancy, drop outs...) if possible.\n- Surprising that most parents didn't object to sex ed in schools.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\nES.242 Gender Issues in Academics and Academia\nSpring 2004\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

(AAUW p. 294)\n- Have you heard of the issue of boys' underenrollment in language and arts classes before?\nHas it struck you as a \"problem\" like girls' underenrollment in physics?\n- Boys and girls are approximately equally represented in the social sciences and APs.\n- Remedial classes and tracking: Good or bad?\no Good for gifted, not for others?\no Is it helpful for slower students, or does it just hold them back?\no Is it the responsibility of the schools to provide for the extremes of the bell curve?\nThe state?\n- Girls identified more than boys in gifted programs in elementary school, but they drop out:\nwhy?\no Suggestions: Geek stereotypes, fitting in, etc.\n- \"U.S. culture often equates higher expenditure of effort with lower ability\" (AAUW p.\n291). What does this say about boys (who often assume/say their success is due to ability)\nand girls (who often assume/say their success is due to effort)? Does this stereotype ring\ntrue? Could girls' efforts be to compensate for lower ability, or perhaps to give the\nimpression of lower ability so as not to be \"too smart\"? (\"Oh, I just studied really hard for\nthat test; it's not that I'm a math genius\"--and thus geeky and unattractive.)\n\nMIT ES.242 \"Gender Issues in Academics and Academia\" (Spring 2004) - Laurel Ruhlen & Kayla Jacobs\n(2) Fine: Sex Education\n- \"Adolescent sexuality â†’ victimization and danger\" theme.\n- \"Sex-negative attitudes do not discourage sexual activity, but they do discourage\nresponsible use of contraception. Teens who believe sexual involvement is wrong deny\nresponsibility for contraception. To accept responsibility would legitimate 'bad' behavior\"\n(Fine p. 377).\n- Personal experience: 9th grade \"Life Skills\" class video on rape had only female victims of\nmale aggressors depicted.\no What does this portrayal say to boys who don't/won't rape?\no What about male victims of rape? (More of 'em than you might think! Though\nstill much smaller than the number of female victims.)\n- Don't get into an argument about abstinence education: rather, focus on academic effects\n(pregnancy, drop outs...) if possible.\n- Surprising that most parents didn't object to sex ed in schools.\n\nMIT ES.242 \"Gender Issues in Academics and Academia\" (Spring 2004) - Laurel Ruhlen & Kayla Jacobs\nSESSION 4: Title IX\nReadings to complete before class:\n(1) Sandler, Bernice Resnick. \"Too Strong for a Woman: The Five Words that Created Title IX.\"\nChapter 1 in The Jossey-Bass Reader on Gender in Education.

To \"balance\" the amount\nof money the school spends on them, they offer ridiculously specialized and obscure\nwomen's sports that no one really wants. (Similar to Arizona rowing team example.)\n- Could argue that women aren't as interested in sports as men because there aren't enough\nopportunities, encouragement, scholarships, prestige, etc. - which could be helped by\nkeeping the sports interpretation Title IX as is.\n- Or could argue that there's just a statistical fact: that boys like sports more than girls -\nmaybe because of biology, and maybe because of society, and maybe because of a mixture\nof the two - but the fact remains. Thus, spending should be divvied up accordingly.\no But then couldn't you make this argument about non-sports subjects, too? e.g.\n\"Girls just don't like computers as much as boys, so let's not care if they're\noutnumbered in computer science 3-1.\"\n\nMIT ES.242 \"Gender Issues in Academics and Academia\" (Spring 2004) - Laurel Ruhlen & Kayla Jacobs\nSESSION 5: Standardized Tests\nReadings to complete before class:\n(1) Sadker, Myra and David Sadker. \"Designing Tests\" in \"Test Dive.\" Chapter 6 in Failing at\nFairness.

The sauciness of the playground\ndisappears, and, in fact, she says hardly a word during class. Meanwhile, the boys,\nespecially those who are more physically mature, sprawl in their chairs, stretching their\nlegs long, expanding into the available space\" (p.7).\n- \"When the girls... do speak, they follow the rules... When Amy volunteers her sole answer\nof the period, she raises her hand, too. She gives the wrong answer to an easy\nmultiplication problem, turns crimson, and flips her head forward so her hair falls over her\nface. Occasionally, the girls shout out answers, but generally they are the easiest, lowest-\nrisk questions, such as the factors of four or six. And their stabs at public recognition\ndepend on the boys' largesse; when the girls venture responses to more complex questions\nthe boys quickly become territorial, shouting them down with their own answers... [The\nteacher] doesn't say anything to condone the boys' aggressiveness, but she doesn't have to:\nthey insist on--and receive--her attention even when she consciously tries to shift it\nelsewhere in order to make the class more equitable.\" (p. 9).\n- \"I don't raise my hand in my classes because I'm afraid I have the wrong answer and I'll\nbe embarrassed\" (p.11).\n- Classroom interactions as power struggles.\n(2) Failing at Fairness: \"Missing in Interaction\"\n- To preserve order, most teachers use established classroom conventions such as raising\nyour hand if you want to talk. Intellectually, teachers know they should apply this rule\nconsistently, but when the discussion becomes fast-paced and furious, the rule is often\nswept aside. When this happens and shouting out begins, it is an open invitation for male\ndominance. Our research shows that boys call out significantly more often than girls.\n\nMIT ES.242 \"Gender Issues in Academics and Academia\" (Spring 2004) - Laurel Ruhlen & Kayla Jacobs\nSometimes what they say has little or nothing to do with the teacher's questions. Whether\nmale comments are insightful or irrelevant, teachers respond to them. However, when girls\ncall out, there is a fascinating occurrence: Suddenly the teacher remembers the rule about\nraising your hand before you talk. And then the girl, who is usually not as assertive as the\nmale students, is deftly and swiftly put back in her place. Not being allowed to call out like\nher male classmates... will not psychologically scar [her]; however, the system of silencing\noperates covertly and repeatedly. It occurs several times a day during each school week for\ntwelve years, and even longer if [she] goes to college, and, most insidious of all, it happens\nsubliminally. This micro-inequity eventually has a powerful cumulative impact\" (Failing\nat Fairness pp. 43-44).\n- \"On the surface, girls appear to be doing well. They get better grades and receive fewer\npunishments than boys... Reinforced for passivity...

Funds lots of influential research on girls and women in\neducational settings (both pre- and post-university levels). Also has funds female graduate\nstudent stipends and holds national conferences on women in education.\nhttp://www.aauw.org\n\nMIT ES.242 \"Gender Issues in Academics and Academia\" (Spring 2004) - Laurel Ruhlen & Kayla Jacobs\n- Did you recognize the social cues and norms from your own experience? (Does answer\ndiffer depending on gender of student?)\n- Big emphasis on role models\no Really seemed to be a make-or-break factor.\no What does this mean for areas without lots of female (or male!) role models? For\nexample, physics today or medicine in the past for women, full-time homemaking\nor nursing for men.\no Note over 50% of medical school students are female; less than 5% of nurses are\nmale.\no Keep in mind that there's often a big difference between the percentage of a\nprofessional school class being a certain gender and the percentage of a profession\nbeing a certain gender. Practicing professionals went to school years ago, when\nthe percentages were often different (usually reflecting traditional gender roles).\nBrings up \"leaky-pipeline\" issue too.\n- Did you have any difficulties relating to Angela? Why?\n- The \"schoolgirls\" studied were mostly white - would there be different conclusions for\nother racial groups? What would you expect the differences to be?\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\nES.242 Gender Issues in Academics and Academia\nSpring 2004\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

Some criticism recently that\nMIT's efforts have not continued being pursued very vigorously.\n- \"How do these trends project into the future? To double the percentage of MIT women\nfaculty to 35 percent would take 31 years, and to bring it to 50 percent would take 60\nyears--assuming that current faculty size, number of hires per year, percentage of women\nhires and tenure rates remained unchanged, Hopkins said\" (Tech Talk article).\n- Why is gender (racial, economic, cultural...) diversity important, aside from ensuring that\nthose groups are included? What are the benefits to the \"overrepresented majority\"?\no \"A diverse faculty can carry out the mission of our department better than a\nnondiverse one\" (Penfield).\n- Affirmative action: a whole can of worms.\n- MIT undergraduate admissions office defense of why women have a higher acceptance\nrate than men (though since the number of male applicants is much larger, overall more\n\nMIT ES.242 \"Gender Issues in Academics and Academia\" (Spring 2004) - Laurel Ruhlen & Kayla Jacobs\nmen are admitted than women): the women applicants are more self-selecting, with only\nthe very best even applying.\n- \"First and foremost it is essential to set aside the issue of whether these women were badly\ntreated because they were simply not good enough. It must be understood that for these\nparticular women the opposite was undeniably true. Despite discrimination, most of these\nwomen achieved at an outstanding level within their professions... Only people above the\naverage MIT faculty could have succeeded at this level despite the many obstacles the\nsenior women faculty encountered in their careers. Indeed, it should be almost obvious that\nthe first women, the first blacks, the pioneers who break through despite enormous barriers\nmust be exceptional\" (Study on the Status).\n- \"Women are often the harshest critics of other women they deem less than better than most\nfaculty for fear that they will reflect badly on all women\" (Study on the Status).\n- How much of the responsibility for improving diversity is MIT's, and how much is\nsociety's?\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\nES.242 Gender Issues in Academics and Academia\nSpring 2004\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."
