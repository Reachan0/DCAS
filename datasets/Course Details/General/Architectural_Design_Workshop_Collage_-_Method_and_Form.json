  "course_name": "Architectural Design Workshop: Collage - Method and Form",
  "course_description": "This class investigates the theory, method, and form of collage. It studies not only the historical precedents for collage and their physical attributes, but the psychology and process that plays a part in the making of them. The class was broken into three parts, changing scales and methods each time, to introduce and study the rigor by which decisions were made in relation to the collage. The class was less about the making of art than the study of the processes by which art is made.",

  "syllabus_content": "Though the purpose of this workshop was to study and make collages, the underlying project was to alter the methodological and pedagogical rhythms of the architectural studio. The semester, unbeknownst to the student until the final review, was laid out in three parts in which each week a different work ambiance was given as an assignment. It was agreed that all work was to be done out of paper found in the trash.\n\nTo thwart any attempt by the students to think that they were \"making art,\" however, in the first part of the semester they had to endure a process by which they produced work that I destroyed each week. The mode of \"destruction\" changed with each meeting. The class period was used to \"repair\" the damage or reconstitute the authorial presence. This give-and-take eventually involved not only me but the class as well. In the second part of the semester, the students were teamed up and had to design a relationship that gave methodological rigor to the dynamics of adding and subtracting, discovery and recovery, building onto the surface of the collage and digging into it. Only in the last week, were the students \"free\" to work on their collage without interference from others.\n\nBoth political and psychoanalytical ideas were at play. What we notice and what we don't notice in beginning a collage can be seen as both an artistic and a political problem. Furthermore, the continual attempt to demote the ego in the studio challenged the principle of \"ownership\" that is presumed to be such an important part of avant-garde art production. In fact, everything that was made in the semester had multiple and sometime anonymous authors. In some instances it was not clear how to trace all the events that had taken place in the production of a piece. Ownership came into play only at the end of each methodological unit. In other words, the last person to touch and transform it owns it.\n\nMy critique of the work, therefore, was never about a student's intention (in relationship to a \"program\" or a set of desires as it might be in architecture), but about the rigor by the procedural decisions that were made. The message in this was that despite the insistence on method, as a type of game plan, not only did \"art\" arrive, but also each student's individual aesthetic soon came to shine through the work. In fact, as the semester progressed the differences between the students became more obvious and thus more useable in creating new strategies of interaction.\n\nThe semester was also designed around the question of scale. In the first third of the semester we worked toward making something only a few inches square, the idea being to get the students to sharpen their intensity and skills of observation. The second third students made things that could be held by the hand; and in the final part of the semester the students moved to the scale of the wall by working on large door panels. The purpose was to get the students to continually think of the interrelationship of these scales.\n\nThe Syllabus, in Graphic Form (\nPDF\n)",

They\nwere asked to \"do\" a\ncollage in twenty minutes.\nThis was to test their\nassumption that the line\nwas arbitrary and thus\nmeaningless. What is it\nthat we notice in the\nenvironment and what is\nit that we ignore?\n\nExercise 2 SEQUENCE ONE: EXTRACTION\nBack of a collage.\n-Each \"collage\" was cut\nin half and students were\ngiven two pieces\narbitrarily. (Life's Lesson\nnumber Two.) They had\nto unify - or in some way\ncreate a whole - out of\nthe two sides.\n\nExercise 3 SEQUENCE ONE: EXTRACTION\n-I used white house paint\nto cover over and\nobliterate the entire\nsurface of the \"collage\"\nthat the students had\nworked on the previous\nweek. (Life's Lesson\nNumber Three.) Students\nhad to recover their\ndesign and/or in some\nway deal with the\nobliteration of their work.\nOver-painted split collage.\n\nExercise 4 SEQUENCE ONE: EXTRACTION\n-Students, in consultation\nwith each other, had to\ntake cut out small square\nmini-collages out of the\nboards. Using paper and\nmoving it across the\nsurface of the larger work,\nthey extracted as many\nmoments of aesthetic\nquality as they could find.\n\nExercise 5 SEQUENCE ONE: EXTRACTION\n-Students were asked to\nframe the mini-collages in\nany way that they thought\nsuitable. The frame was a\nway to protect and\nenhance works that are\notherwise insubstantial or\nfragmentary. The frame\nalso, obviously, defines\nthe nature of the viewing\ncondition.\nKYLE STEINFELD\n\nExercise 6 SEQUENCE TWO: EXPANSION\n-Students were asked to\nwrite up a description of a\none-inch square piece of\nany painting. The purpose\nhere, as with the previous\nexercises, was to get the\nstudents to look intensely\nand closely at the surface;\nto see details. At stake is\nmore than just the premise\nof observation, but also the\npsychology of intimacy.\nHow close can one get to a\nsurface or color to know\nit?\n\nExercise 7 SEQUENCE TWO: EXPANSION\n-Students were asked to\n\"paint\" a collage using the\ndescriptions from fellow\nstudents as an instruction\nbooklet. The purpose here\nwas to get students who\nmight never have mixed\ncolors before to begin to\nthink with color.The\nlesson was also about the\nproductive\ninsubstantialities that exist\nbetween text and image.\n\nExercise 8 SEQUENCE TWO: EXPANSION\nPABLO WENCESLAO\n-Students were then\ngiven the small paintings\nand asked to interpret\nthem by producing three\ndimensional models of\nthe colors. These models\nwere the end products of\nSequence Two.\n\nExercise 9 SEQUENCE THREE: RELATIONAL\n-At the beginning of\nSequence Three, two\nstudents were asked to\nwork together to produce\na collage. They were only\nallowed to use paper.\nThey had to design the\nspecifics of their\n\"relationship\" beforehand\nin order to be clear about\ntheir methodological\nintentions. The end result\nhad to be framed and\nfinished.\n\n-The class went to the\nFogg Art Museum, where\nthe curators exhibited\ncollages and other works\non paper for the class. We\nalso went to the MIT\nMuseum to look at their\nPeruzzi drawings.\n\nExercise 10 SEQUENCE THREE: RELATIONAL\n-To move from the small\nscale of a few square\ninches to a larger scale,\nthe students, still working\nas a team, began to\nprepare the base for a\ncollage the size of a door.\nThe principles here were\nchaos and addition.\n\nExercise 11 SEQUENCE THREE: RELATIONAL\n-Two students, in\ndifferent combinations\nfrom before, worked on\neach prepared door. They\ntook turns in twenty\nminute intervals playing\n\"king\" and \"worker.\" The\nking instructs and the\nworker performs. The\nprinciple here is economy\nand control. The aesthetic\nchoices have to get harder\nand more nuanced as the\nking struggles to make\nsense of the large picture.\n\nExercise 12 SEQUENCE THREE: RELATIONAL\n-The students held a\nreview of their work with\nvisiting critics and guests."
