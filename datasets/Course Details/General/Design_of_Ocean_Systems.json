  "course_description": "This course covers the complete cycle of designing an ocean system using computational design tools for the conceptual and preliminary design stages. Students complete the projects in teams with each student responsible for a specific subsystem. Lectures cover such topics as hydrodynamics; structures; power and thermal aspects of ocean vehicles; environment, materials, and construction for ocean use; and generation and evaluation of design alternatives. The course focuses on innovative design concepts chosen from high-speed ships, submersibles, autonomous vehicles, and floating and submerged deep-water offshore platforms. Lectures on ethics in engineering practice are included, and instruction and practice in oral and written communication is provided.",

Lecture notes also provide the key reading material. The readings were supplemented by select articles on specific topics, especially on the design of floating offshore structures.\n\nThe following three texts are particularly suggested as references:\n\nLewis, E. V., ed.\nPrinciples of Naval Architecture\n. Jersey City, NJ: Society of Naval Architects and Marine Engineers, 1988. ISBN: 9789991181417.\n\nThis reference provides general information on naval architecture.\n\nPaik, Jeom Kee, and Anil Kumar.\nShip-shaped Offshore Installations: Design, Building, and Operation\n. Cambridge University Press, 2007. ISBN: 9780521859219.\n\nThis reference gives some basic information on the design of special marine structures (i.e. FPSOs).\n\nFaltinsen, O. M.\nSea Loads on Ships and Offshore Structures\n. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 1993. ISBN: 9780521458702.\n\nThis reference helps with understanding of sea-keeping analysis and mooring-system design.\n\nThe following resources may also be helpful:\n\nGillmer, T. C., and Bruce Johnson.\nIntroduction to Naval Architecture\n. Naval Institute Press, 1982. ISBN: 9780870213182.\n\nLamb, Thomas. Chapter 30 in\nShip Design and Construction Vol. 1\n. 1st Impression Publishing, 2003. ISBN: 9780939773404.\n\nTerpstra, T., B. B. d'Hautefeuille, and A. A. MacMillan. \"FPSO Design and Conversion: A Designer's Approach.\" Offshore Technology Conference, 2001.\n\nCoursework\n\nCoursework consists primarily of a three-part term-length Design Project and three homework assignments, all designed to help students better comprehend the basic concepts taught in class. The goal is also to prepare the students for the use of the various pieces of software needed for the Design Project. The Design Project is to be completed in team with each individual responsible for the report and discussion of a separate subject; homework is to be done individually.\n\nHomework\n\nIn the first homework, the students conceptualize their design by doing preliminary calculations and drawing sketches of different ship views and internal subdivisions. For example, they calculate the positions of the collision bulkheads, the size of the tanks, the height of the double bottom, etc. Next, they realize this concept in the PARAMARINETM environment, calculating major geometric particulars such as coefficients of form and preliminary hydrostatic characteristics.\n\nThe second homework is a structural analysis of a generic ship. From the framework of building a ship that can withstand the maximum allowable working stress, students calculate the total load on the ship, shear forces, bending moments, plate thickness, and the dimensions of the midship section structural elements.\n\nThe third homework is an introduction to the panel method of sea-keeping analysis. The students use WAMIT(r) to calculate the added mass and wave damping coefficients as well as wave excitation and RAOs for a floating vertical circular cylinder. The purpose of this homework is to become familiar with the use of WAMIT for sea-keeping analysis.\n\nGrading\n\nACTIVITIES\n\nPERCENTAGES\n\nDesign project\n\n80%\n\nHomework\n\n20%\n\nCalendar\n\nSES #\n\nTOPICS\n\nPROJECT ACTIVITIES\n\nKEY DATES\n\nIntroduction\n\nWork on design 1\n\nShip Design Tool: PARAMARINE\n\nDesign 1 (ship sizing and hydrostatics) out; HW 1 out\n\nShip Hydrostatics and Structures\n\nShip Hydrostatics and Structures (cont.)\n\nHW 1 due\n\nSeakeeping\n\nSeakeeping (cont.)\n\nSeakeeping (cont.)\n\nSeakeeping (cont.)\n\nDesign 1 due; HW 2 out\n\nDrift Loads/Motions\n\nWork on design 2\n\nDesign 1 feedback; Design 2 (seakeeping analysis) out\n\nSlowly-Varying Loads/Motions\n\nHW 2 due\n\nSlowly-Varying Loads/Motions (cont.)\n\nOcean Environment\n\nOcean Environment (cont.)\n\nMooring Dynamics\n\nDesign 2 due; HW 3 out\n\nMooring Dynamics (cont.)\n\nWork on design 3\n\nMooring Design\n\nHW 3 due; Design 3 out\n\nManufacturing/Fabrication\n\nManufacturing/Fabrication (cont.)\n\nShip Resistance\n\nShip Resistance (cont.)\n\nDesign 3 due\n\nShip Slamming\n\nIntegrate final report and prepare for final presentation\n\nDesign 3 feedback; practice presentation\n\nRoll Control\n\nPropulsion\n\nAdvanced Topics\n\nFinal presentations\n\nFinal presentation due\n\nAdvanced Topics (cont.)\n\nWork on final report\n\nSummary and Conclusion\n\nFinal report due",

Short waves\ndecay faster.\nShorter waves are\nsteeper, and easier\nto break\n\nRequired fetch and storm duration:\n-Wind must blow over long\nperiods of time and large\ndistances to reach fully-\ndeveloped state.\n-At fully-developed state,\nUw ~ Vp (i.e. ωlimit ~ g/Uw)\n-Swell: waves are not\ngenerated by local wind\n-Sea: waves generated by\nlocal wind\n\nStandard Wave Spectra\nS(ω)\nBased on measured spectra and theoretical results, standard spectrum forms have been developed:\nBretschneider spectrum:\nS(ω) = 1.25 ω4\nH2\n¡\n¢4\nm\nωm\nω5\ns exp{-1.25\nω\n}\nωm is peak or modal frequency\nHs is significant wave height\nR\n¡\n¢2\ninfS(ω)dω = M0 =\nHs\nFor fully developed sea (Pierson-Moskowitz spectrum):\nq\nωm = 0.4\nH\ng\ns\nJONSWAP Spectrum:\nS(ω) = αg 2 exp{-1.25\n¡ ωp ¢4\nexp{-0.5¡ ω-ωp ¢2 }\nω5\nω\n¡\n} · γ\nσωp\nα = 5.061 ω\n2π\np ¢4 Hs\n2[1 - 0.287 log γ]\nHs: significant wave frequency\nωp: peak frequency\nσ = 0.07 for σ < ωp, and σ = 0.09 for ω ≥ ωp\nγ: peak enhance coefficient\n\nCombined Sea and Swell:\nS(ω) = Sswell(ω) + Ssea(ω)\nSea\nS(ω)\n\nResponse Spectra of a Floating Structure in Irregular Waves\nFor a linear time-invariant (LTI) system:\nInput\noutput\nη (ω)eiωt\nLTI\nζ j (ω)eiωt\n, j = 1, . . . , 6\nζj (ω)\nHj (ω) = η (ω)\nj = 1, . . . , 6\nHj (ω) :Transfer function ( or RAO) of the linear system, determined by the system itself\nSpectra of the response:Sζj (ω) = |Hj (ω)| 2 Sη (ω) ,\nwhere Sη(ω) is wave spectrum\nDesign strategy:\n- To avoid large response, make the peak of Hj(ω) away from the peak of Sη(ω)\n- For wave energy extraction, make the peak of Hj(ω) close to the peak of Sη(ω)\n\nShort-Term Statistics\nS(ω)\nNarrowband\nBroadband\n- Once the spectrum of a random process is\ngiven, the statistics of the random process\ncan be obtained in terms of moments and\nbandwidth of the spectrum.\nZ inf\nMoments:\nm0 =\nS(ω)dω\nZ0\nm2 =\ninf\nω2S(ω)dω\nZ0\nm4 =\ninf\nω4S(ω)dω\n. . . . . .\nBandwidth coefficient:\nq\nm\n2 =\n,\n1 - m0m4\n0 ≤ 2 ≤ 1\nIf ε ≥ ~0.5, called broadband\nIf ε < ~0.5, called narrowband\nIn typical ocean, ε=0.5 ~ 0.6\n\nIssue in Evaluating mn (with n ≥ 4)\nTypically for ocean waves, we have S(ω) ∼ω-5 as ω →inf\nm4 =\nR infω4S(ω)dω =\nR ω1 ω4S(ω)dω +\nR infω4 × ω-5dω\nω1\n(log ω)|inf→inf Diverges !!\nω1\nThere are two solutions for this issue:\n- Truncate the integration up to 3ωm. This has advantage that scaling can be\napplied between model and full-scale tests.\n- Choose a constant upper limit, typically ωmax = 2.0 radian/sec..
