It will deal with the change in perspective imposed by scientific ideas, the general loss of a supernatural or religious perspective upon human events, and the effects for good or ill of the increasing authority of an intelligence uninformed by religion as a guide to life. The readings are roughly complementary to the readings in 21L001, and classroom discussion will stress appreciation and analysis of texts that came to represent the cultural heritage of the modern world.\n\nReadings begin with excerpts from Machiavelli's\nThe Prince\n, which advises the ruler that the end justifies the means and that it is necessary for leaders to \"learn how not to be good.\" We follow with More's\nUtopia\n, an account of life in a \"parallel world\" to the real one, a world in which Christianity never happened. Later we read another book that take place \"Nowhere\", Jonathan Swift's re-imagining of More's text,\nGulliver's Travels\n. More is succeeded by excerpts from the essays of Montaigne, who invented the form that we now call the \"essay\", and who, it is often said to be invented the modern sense of self-consciousness, that is, of simply being our own particular self, regardless of inherited or achieved social identities, in a changeful world. Machiavellianism is put to some examination in\nKing Lear\n, arguably Shakespeare's central tragedy, which examines the sources of political and moral authority in a pre-Christian world. Further readings include: Thomas Hobbes's\nLeviathan\n(1651), an extraordinary account of human beings as nothing but calculating machines, which traces the implications this view for political and ethical life; Rousseau's\nOn the Origins of Inequality\nwhich transformed current ideas about human nature and was an important source for the ideologues of the French Revolution; readings from Wordsworth's\nPrelude\n, perhaps the first thoroughly modern poem and the major source in the nineteenth century for the idea that a right relation to its natural environment was essential for humanity's ethical life; excerpts from Immanuel Kant's\nThe Metaphysical Foundation\nof\nMorals\n, in which Kant argues the case that reason alone is sufficient as guide to the moral life; Jane Austen's classic social novel,\nPride and Prejudice\nand Balzac's\nPere Goriot\n, which makes a case for a-morality in an immoral world. We conclude with two texts: Friedrich Nietzsche's\nGenealogy of Morals\n, an extended argument against the validity of the concept \"evil\" and George Bernard Shaw's\nMajor Barbara\n, a social comedy about the conflict between religious conviction and worldliness.\n\nCourse Format\n\nThe subject meets twice a week for two one-and-a-half sessions. Each session begins with a lecture of varying length, but changes over early into general discussion. Active participation in discussion is essential to the life of the class and the force and cogency of students' remarks will have a marked influence on grades. Readings will total approximately seventy-five pages a week, sometimes more, sometimes less. Much of the grade will also depend upon the quality of the three written assignments required by the course, and spaced fairly evenly over the term: the papers will total twenty pages in entirety, two papers running to at least six pages each and a final paper running to at least eight pages. The papers will each deal with some aspect of the readings and discussion; topics may be invented by the students but an extensive list of suggested topics will be circulated two weeks in advance of each paper's due date for those students who require it. The first of these papers will be rewritten upon its return and resubmitted in a form complaint with corrections made by the instruction on the pages of the first version. The second paper may be treated in the same way, depending upon the instructor's judgment. The subject will also offer students opportunity for oral expression by reason of (a) its discussion format and (b) a division into groups of two or three students (depending upon enrollment), each of which will make two fifteen-minute presentations of materials conducive to the discussion of a given assignment, following the model of such presentations offered by the instructor at the outset of the term. The maximum number of students per section of this subject is 18, except in cases where there are no sections and where a writing fellow is attached to the subject, in which case the enrollment can rise to 25. There will be no final examination.",

      "content": "PAPER ASSIGNMENTS\n\n(a) First paper:\n21L002\nSpring, 2003\nPapers are due by the end of Lecture #11, and should consist of approximately five pages (figure 320\nwords/page), not counting the title-page. I add that choice of large type, triple-spacing and huge margins\nare of no avail; word-count is what matters, and this should be checked with your word-processing\nprogram and the number of words entered on the title-page. Please number the pages; it will help me in\nwriting my comments.\nPlease remember that you are writing an essay, not a book-report. An interpretative essay addresses itself\nto readers who have read the work under discussion and do not require an account of its contents\n(although they may not recall the work in detail). What an essay (as opposed to a book-report) does\nsupply is some reminder of those contents in the context of an argument about them; the reminder is\noffered in the course of explaining how one should understand or interpret the work in question. Any\ngood, short, coherent essay will be arguing something. It will help you to write an essay if you have in\nmind some point that you are trying to make. Such a point should not be self-evident; you should be able\nto state an opposing point (the one that you are denying), which is not so obvious that no one would be\nable to argue in its favor.\nThe following questions and topics are meant to be suggestive. If you wish to modify them or invent a\ntopic of your own, you may do so, but the object of the discussion should be one (or more) of the texts\nread and discussed so far this term.\n**************************************\nMachiavelli says that people will continue to trust someone who breaks his word because (a) you can\nalways give good reasons for breaking your word; (b) people are \"so ready to obey present necessities\"\nthat they allow themselves to be deceived. What is meant by \"present necessities\"? (Don't just say; give\nreasons for your interpretation, in the light of your understanding of the text.) Is the notion of \"allowing\nyourself to be deceived\" a coherent notion? Explain, and in doing so, elucidate what Machiavelli had in\nmind in the light of his whole argument.\nWhy do people need the illusion, if not the reality, of the five qualities the appearance of which\nMachiavelli says that the prince must cultivate: merciful, sincere (keeping your word), humane\n(compassionate), forthright (openness about your intentions, i.e., without a hidden agenda), religious?\n(NB: the qualities differ slightly, depending upon what translation you read.) Machiavelli does not give\nreasons but he comments often upon \"what most people are like\". Do any of these comments explain the\nmatter? Machiavelli did not publish \"The Prince\" but circulated it in a semi-public way, and there is\nample indication that he meant it for such general publication. If the prince is supposed to cultivate the\nillusion of possessing these qualities, doesn't blabbing the need for this rather give the game away?\nMachiavelli's adage, \"The ends justify the means,\" is justly famous, although he evidently did not say this\n(or, rather, its Italian equivalent) precisely. What he did say was that the motives behind anyone=s\nactions are hard to know and that this is especially the case with the actions of princes, who can=t be\nobserved by their subjects at close hand; hence, in the case of princes, actions are usually judged by their\nresults. Despite the inaccuracy, however, the attribution of the phrase Athe ends justify the means@ to\nMachiavelli has stuck (our translation, which dates from two centuries back, uses it), and the reason is,\n\nevidently, that the phrase suits the spirit of Machiavelli=s argument. Comment on this. Further, you\nmight consider whether there is a possible contradiction implied by the phrase: if the ends justify the\nmeans, what sense does it make to say that the Prince has to learn Ahow not to be good@. If the means are\nnecessary for a good end aren't they, therefore, good?\nIn this connection, what does it mean to advise a chief executive that he must \"learn how not to be good\"?\nIn what way is \"learning\" involved? Machiavelli advises the ruler to be both beast and human being. Is\nthis like wearing two hats, one for the office and another for home? Can you put on and take off the hat\nof a beast at will?\nMachiavelli introduces a radical split between the advice that he will give and the advice found in books,\nwhich (he says) is suitable only for imagined republics and principalities, \"for there is such a gap between\nhow one lives and how one ought to live that anyone who abandons what is done for what ought to be\ndone learns his ruin rather than his preservation.\" Would More disagree with this judgement? The Prince\nwas written for those who rule territories that they did not inherit; Utopia was such a territory, conquered\nby King Utopos. What would More have said of Machiavelli's book, could he have read it? More\nappears in his own book, offering judgement about Raphael's praise of Utopian institutions at the end of\npart two. Do you think that this expressed his genuine opinions? If so, what's the point of writing the\nbook?\nThe Utopians value nothing beyond what it is Anaturally@ worth, and this seems connected with its utility,\nin easing the life of mankind. Hence gold and silver, the so-called \"precious\" metals are held to be nearly\nworthless in comparison with iron; ceremonies and public honors, whereby many acknowledge the\nsuperiority of some, are regarded as \"empty gestures which do nobody any good\". Valuing these things is\nsaid to be the result of \"an idiotic notion\" that things that are scarce are better than things that can be\navailable to everyone. Comment in any way that deals with an understanding or response to the praise\nthat Raphael heaps upon utopian life.\nThe Utopians have an argument which says that pleasure is the aim of human life. Is this argument any\ngood? This argument is sometimes advanced by other moralists in order to condemn mankind, but here it\nserves as praise. Does this imply that non-Utopians, like ourselves, do not always act for pleasure? that\nwith non-Utopians (that is, us) the sacrifice of their own interests or pleasures is a reality? And if so,\nshould we be praised for it? Isn=t self-sacrifice a good thing? Give some account of the Utopian notion of\npleasure, paying careful attention to the deatils of the textBe.g., the division of pleasure into kindsBand\nsome account of the idea of Afalse pleasure@ that follows. There are some features of the discussion of\npleasure that might seem contradictoryCin particular, there are two sorts of people, those who want to\nwork extra hours and certain lay brothers (corresponding to monks in Europe) who work hard and deny\nthemselves much of the pleasure enjoyed by others, and these two sorts are honored by the rest of Utopian\nsociety and are obviously useful to others. Is the notion of pleasure consistent? At the same time,\npleasure is not enoughBfor pleasure to be sanctioned as the goal of individual life, Raphael, argues, one\nhas also to believe in a god who will reward us after death for sacrifices of pleasure that are not rewarded\neventually during our lifetimes. How does this affect the argument that pleasure is the ultimate good? Is\nthe need for a belief in eternal reward a valid reason for believing in God? What would Machiavelli say\nof this? What do you think More actually thought of this aspect of Utopian society?\nMore's Utopians do not follow Machiavelli's advice about not keeping one's word when one makes a\ntreaty with a neighbor because they never make treaties; neither do they swear solemnly to do what\nthey've already said they'll do. Solemn promises are useless; either you are someone who would break\nyour word anyway or someone who would keep it, and so there's no point to treaties and solemn\npromises. (You can't really trust anyone who wants to make them--only a villain or an idiot would defend\nthe notion that swearing makes your word more trustworthy.) How sound is the utopian argument?\n\nShow how this sort of issue is characteristic of many practices distinguishing utopians from the rest of\nmankind.\nCompare and contrast some of the features of Utopian life that, in your opinion, were meant to be\noutlandish with those that were meant to be taken seriouslyCe.g., the absence of poverty. Taking all in\nall, do you think that the Utopians way of life was admired by More, the author? (Not as direct a question\nas it looksCMore might have admired them but thought them unsuitable for Europeans.) The text\nconcludes with the character AMore@ dismissing what Raphael has said on grounds that it would simply\nmean the end of aristocracy, dignity, splendor, and glory. Is the character AMore@ to be identified with the\nauthor? Argue for your answer.\nAAny discussion of the constraining features of Utopian society must take into account three aspects of the\nway of life that it affords. First, in the name of equality, it does away completely with the subservience\nthat the institutions of More=s day enjoined upon the mass of the population to an aristocratic group in\npoint of interest, deference of manner, and obedience to command; second, its institutions carefully\ndiffuse authority throughout the whole of society; and third, its impositions are modest (there is relative\nliberty in choosing one=s occupation, for example) in comparison with the life of labor in pre-industrial\nsociety.@ Discuss the issues raised by this statement, paying attention to the details of the text and being\nmindful of the constraints imposed by modern free-market economies upon those less successful that\nothers in the struggle for subsistence.\nCompare and contrast the character of More's Utopians with Montaigne's cannibals in any way that seems\nproductive of illuminating the texts.\nMontaigne says that he may contradict himself but he never contradicts the truth. Is this possible? Take\nany three (apparent or genuine) contradictions in the texts that we have read and examine the extent to\nwhich they contribute to Montaigne's overall purpose.\nMontaigne gives several accounts of his purpose in writing and also has something to say about its\nnovelty. He is not simple and straightforward about justifying this purpose (e.g., to write about an\nunimportant life, etc. etc.). Can you say anything about the inexplict underlying justification, the value\nthat Montaigne thinks his work has, the good that it might do? Why doesn't he speak overtly about it?\nMontaigne has often been accused of ambling, not to say rambling--of writing essays that move about a\ntopic with no apparent cumulative effect or discernable argumentative order. Comment in any way that\nseems pertinent.\nMontaigne=s text is replete with witty maxims, sometimes offered in paradoxical form: e.g., we must lend\nourselves to others but give ourselves only to ourself; act in a circle, not a straight line; we must be\ndeceived so that we do not deceive ourselves (on p. 769.); since we will not reject ambition out of\nconscience, let us reject it out of ambition (p. 783); we have to exercise our souls to feel how it is\ngradually ebbing away; do not neglect the pleasures of copulation but do not strain to do it with your\nfingers and toes. Pick out a few and show how they fit in with the general theme of the essays as a whole.\nComment on any recurrent theme in the EssaysBe.g., the idea of duty to others versus one=s duty to\noneself.\nExposit the first scene in King Lear in connection with what in your view are the central themes of the\nplay. Get the details right. Was Cordelia right or wrong in her resistance to Lear's request? \"Oh, reason\nnot the need,\" exclaims Lear later in the play (when asked why he needs any retainers). Isn't Cordelia's\nanswer, when she finally speaks, reasoning the need? Recall that the Fool and Edgar (disguised as Poor\n\nTom) tease and torment Lear and Gloucester, respectively; they do not flatter. Why do they do this?\nShakespeare's King Lear was a revision of an earlier play, called King Leir, which was based upon a story\nabout ancient Britain in a well-known collection of historical chronicles. The old play ended with\nCordelia and France coming back and winning back King Lear's kingdom for him. Two generations after\nShakespeare, people felt dissatisfied with Shakespeare's ending and produced a version in which Lear gets\nhis kingdom back and then resigns, and Cordelia marries Edgar, Gloucester's good son (the king of\nFrance gave her shelter in exile and support in the war but didn't marry her). This version held the stage\nuntil early in the nineteenth century. Comment in any way on the appropriateness or inappropriateness of\nthe ending as we have it.\nExamine the concern in Lear with the distinction between getting down to essentials and concern with the\ntrappings of life. This starts early, with France's declaration that Cordelia is herself a dowry, runs through\nLear exchange with the disguised Edmund during the storm, and reaches a kind of climax with Lear's\nvision of anarchy in the \"mad scene\" on the heath. Of course, it is involved in Lear's remark about giving\naway the power of the king and yet keeping \"the additions\" and in the great speech beginning \"O reason\nnot the need\", which talks about giving nature (that is, human nature) more than nature needs.\nWhen the disguised Kent tries to enlist himself in Lear's service, he says \"Thou hast that in thy face which\nI would fain call master--authority.\" (I am paraphrasing slightly.) What meaning does \"authority\" seem\nto have in the play?\nHobbes says that perhaps \"there never was such a time\" as the time that mankind lived in a state of nature\n(although \"savage people in many places of America\" come close) but that we can see what kind of life\nthis would be in civil war and also in wars between nations. The \"state of nature,\" then, isn't a historical\nconcept; it does not refer to a historical time, in Hobbes view. What sort of concept is it? Hobbes writes\nof the natural condition of mankind that it is a state war of \"of every man against every man\" in which\n\"nothing can be unjust. The notions of right and wrong, justice and injustice have there no place\".\nHobbes identifies war as a state of nature--is he correct about the absence of right and wrong in war? If\nthe state of nature has no historical location, where is \"there\" in the sentence just quoted?\n\"Of all voluntary acts, the object is to every man his own good,\" writes Hobbes (p. 93.), and this holds for\nacts of benevolence, forgiveness, gratitude--the exercise of all the virtues, that are possible only in the\ncivilized state (which Hobbes calls the \"civic state). The difference between the natural condition and the\ncivilized condition makes no difference to the essentially self-interested nature of all human activity, in\nHobbes's view. (You might also want to recall the passage in Hobbes, where he says that \"in the\ncondition of mere nature\" good and evil are just names for what we like and what we hate, and that this is\nnot changed by the fact that in civil society we all like the moral virtues and hate the vices.) How is this\nview central to Hobbes's argument?\n\nHobbes also believes that to depose the sovereign is unjust--the people may commit injustice\nagainst the sovereign but not vice versa--and that all injustice is \"absurd\", that is to say, a form of\nself-contradiction, like affirming and denying the same proposition. Enlarge upon this notion and\nelucidate its connection with Hobbes=s argument.\nImagine that More's Utopians stumbled upon Hobbes's text, via some kind of time warp. What\nwould they make of it? Alternatively, imagine what Hobbes might have said about More's\ndepiction of Utopian life. (Hobbes actually knew More=s text but never commented upon it.)\n**************************************"

Please number the pages of your essay; it will help me in writing comments. The questions\nand topics listed below are not meant to be addressed directly (although, of course, you may address them\ndirectly if you choose). They are meant to be suggestive, to get you thinking about the materials. If you\nwish to modify them or invent a topic of your own, you may do so. However, it remains the case that the\nsubject of papers should be one (or more) of the texts read and discussed during the second third of this\nterm, covering the readings from Hobbes through Rousseau.\nI repeat some remarks from the first assignment: Please remember that you are writing an essay, not a\nbook-report. An interpretative essay addresses itself to readers who have read the work under discussion\nand do not require an account of its contents (although they may not recall the work in detail).

What I have written should not count as part of the quantity of prose that you are\nsubmitting in satisfaction of this assignment.\n**************************************\n\"O reason not the need. Our basest beggars are in their poorest things superfluous. Ask not\nnature more than nature needs, man's life were cheap as beasts.\" Several of the works we have read may\nbe regarded as concerned with understanding the relationship between human nature=s needs and the\nneeds imposed by physical nature. Discuss the idea of needs in any text read after Lear and show its\ncentrality to the text in question.\nIt has been observed (most notably by the character \"More\" at the end of Utopia) that utopia is\nnot a place for human beings as we know them; and several of you argued that this was the right view in\nyour papers. The view, of course, arguably applies to the land of the Houyhnhnms--the inhabitants are\nhorses, after all, not people. At the end of the tale, however, Gulliver becomes \"infatuated\" with the\nHouyhnhnms way of life; he wants to live as the Houyhnhnms do. Does this invalidate the view of\nhuman beings that he expresses in the last chapter of the book?\nWhat \"nature teaches\" is an underlying subject of some of the texts that we have read. Gulliver's\nmaster in Houyhnhnm-land tells Gulliver that his kind have an equal affection for all young houyhnhnms\nand that Nature teaches them to love the whole of their species. Is this an ethical ideal? What about\n\"family values\"? The word \"houyhnhnm\" means \"the perfection of nature\" in Houyhnhnm-speak. The\nUtopians in More's book also lay claim to living \"naturally\". How valid is the application of the word\n\"nature\" and its derivatives in these cases?\n\nA Houyhnhnm might well approve of Cordelia's reply to Lear's desire for an expression of\nexclusive, all-consuming love: \"I love you according to my bond, no more nor less.\" Discuss.\nSatire is a mode of literary discourse (if the whole text is satirical, one might call it a genre)\nwhich normally has a specifiable target. If the target is a person, the fiction will observe him or her as a\nspecifiable type; and satire therefore generally implies the existence of specifiable norms of behavior, in\nrespect of which the satirical target is in violation. The satirical target in Gulliver is sometimes described\nas \"mankind\", but this is a very large target indeed and hard to identify. It is also not clear which figures\nin the text represents the norm. Discuss.\nIt is possible to describe something (usually a practice of some kind) that is very familiar in terms\nwhich are accurate but which strips the item described of its significance--a process known in literary\nterms as \"defamiliarization\". Elucidate and discuss in relation to several examples drawn from Gulliver's\nTravels--you might devote particular attention to what the horses try to describe by using the phrase\n\"saying the thing which is not\".\nA view of Swift's book has been often forwarded by many of its readers since its first publication-\n-that Swift was a thoroughgoing misanthrope, a man so overcome with disgust at the physical facts of life\nthat he could not see the potential dignity of humankind. To this end, they cite the continuing resort of\nthe text to what is physically repellant--above all, the way in which Swift has taken everything connected\nwith the passionate and erotic nature of mankind and made a kind of trash heap of it, which he called the\nYahoos. In this view, Gulliver's rejection of humankind at the end of the book--his loathing of even so\nhumane a person as Don Pedro--is taken to express Swift's own feelings. Comment.\nCompare or contrast in any way you choose the land of the Houyhnhnms with either Montaigne's\ncannibals or the island of Utopia.\nComment on the statement made by Rousseau at the outset of his text that we must have a true\nidea of the natural state of mankind, even though it is a state that perhaps never existed or could exist.\nHow does this notion relate to the rest of his views expressed in the text? Making judgements about the\nactual world by imagining a better state that perhaps never existed or could exist sounds like a recipe for\nwriting a utopia. Is the idea of a utopia useful in discussing Rousseau's state of nature?\n\"In civilization we lose our authenticity as human beings.\" Rousseau didn't write this sentence,\nnor did he use the term authenticity (or its French equivalent), but the notion that the sentence expresses\nhas often been offered as the meaning of the Second Discourse. How would you assess the validity this\nnotion as a summary of Rousseau's views?\nRousseau actually had to invent the French word for \"perfectibility\" to describe the essential\nquality of mankind in distinction from all other animals. How would you explain this quality? How\nwould you defend the idea that it is central to Rousseau's argument in the Second Discourse?\nRousseau gives a brief account of Hobbes's view of the state of nature. How accurate is his\naccount? How astute are his criticisms of Hobbes? Compare their views of \"mankind in a state of\nnature.\" The view each has of \"the state of nature\" is different from the other's; how different is their\nview of mankind?\nIt has been said that Hobbes's state of nature is very like the Yahoos represented by Swift in\nGulliver's Travels and Swift's Houyhnhnms come close to Rousseau's notion of the earliest stages of\ncivilization, where the capacities for goodness that Rousseau thought were inherent in human nature had\nnot yet been thoroughly corrupted by early forms of socialization. Criticize or amplify either point or\n\nboth.\nWordsworth believes that the best self is a product of unconscious development, but in his case it\nis not fully expressed in the activity of reason, and it is not fostered by interchange with other human\nbeings but by exposure to the influences of something that he calls Nature. Comment.\nThe learned among Wordsworth's first audience found his early verse \"inconclusive\"--it didn't\nseem to be clearly about anything. In The Prelude the poet is fairly explicit about this--he says that he\nmakes breathings for incommunicable powers, that he would needs words unknown to man to present the\nvisionary dreariness of one of the moments in his past that contain a \"renovating virtue\" (this is in Bk 12),\nand so on. The typical Wordsworthian image is of something happening at great depth, psychologically,\nin response to something other or behind what is described, and the response is unwilled, undeliberative,\nsudden, \"mildly shocking\" or \"mildly surprising\"; for all its importance the impact of the experience\ndoesn't reveal itself to an observer and sometimes doesn't reveal itself to the person responding . Take\nany few passages and comment in the light of your view of the overall intention of the poem.\nIn suggesting that Aour heart is with infinitude, and only there. with hope and expectation and\ndesire and something evermore about to be@, Wordsworth touches upon a sense of the endless restlessness\nof the human spirit that is common to many of the Romantic poets. But this endless restlessness is also\nattributed to humanity by Hobbes, for whom it is also a defining feature of humanity. Yet the views of\nHobbes and Wordsworth are diametrically opposed upon this subject, despite the appearance of\nsimilarity, for Wordsworth takes this feature of humanity to be something that gives each individual a\nspiritual depth, whereas for Hobbes it is a mark of the triviality of human desires. Comment.\n\nIn The Prelude, Wordsworth writes that the French Revolution raised hopes of fashioning\nan ideal state in reality (not in \"Utopias\"), wherein mankind would a life fulfilled in public as well\nas private interchange. As a result, Wordsworth, at first plunged into despair but later came to\nrealize that the proper exemplar (role-model) for humanity was not the statesman (the Roman\nrepublican, which the French revolution tried to revive in the figure of the \"citizen\") but the poet.\nIn what sense is the poet an exemplary figure, a model for the best that we can be? In what sense\ndoes Wordsworth believe that everyone is, in essence, a poet? (This notion, which, we recall,\nwent along with his willingness to speak of people who didn't write poetry--including small\nchildren--as \"poetic spirits\", was the occasion for some in his early audience to poke fun at his\nwritings.)\nTake any of the passages descriptive of Wordsworth's boyhood years and discuss their\nsubstance and their place in the overall argument about the lasting effect of early years on the\nmature person.\nIt could be said that Hobbes and Kant see ethics in similar terms, since each thinks in\nterms of laws that people can agree are reasonable. Describe the two theories and indicate the\nextent to which you think that they agree and disagree about the nature of morality.\nOne way (there are many) to describe Kant=s view is to say that he does not think that you\ncan justify an ethical maxim, for example, ANever tell a lie@, but you can show that you cannot\nconsistently will its contrary, ALie whenever it suits you.@ The justification depends upon\naccepting the premise that maxims of ethical conduct are universalBthat is, they are addressed not\nto whoever you happen to be by virtue of natural advantages, social position, lineage, or the\nappetites and aversions that you happen to possess, but simply to you in your capacity as a\nrational agent, which is to say that they apply to just anybody. Discuss.\nKant offers two different formulations of the Categorical ImperativeCone that tests\nwhether it makes sense to express the maxim upon which the agent will act as a universal law, the\nother that enjoins an agent to treat other rational beings never just as a means but always also as\nan end. Explain these two formulations and say something about the connection between them.\nSome philosophers have tried to discredit the first formulation by pointing out that it justifies\ntrivialities (AEveryone must always write with a felt-tipped pen@) or immoralities (AAlways\npersecute those who hold religious beliefs different from your own@) or numerical qualifications\n(ANever tell more than twelve lies a year@).

      "content": "PAPER ASSIGNMENTS\n\n(c) Third Paper:\n21L002\nSpring 2003\nPapers are due at the end of Lecture #25 and should consist of at least eight pages (figure 320\nwords/page). The questions below are not meant to be answered directly (although, of course, you may\nanswer them during the course of your essay); you don't have to answer all or even any of them. They are\nmeant to be suggestive, to get you thinking about the materials. If you wish to modify them or invent a\ntopic of your own, you may do so. However, it remains the case that at least half the paper should be\ndevoted to one (or more) of the texts read and discussed during the last third of this term, covering the\nreadings from Jane Austen onwards.\nSUGGESTED TOPICS\nDiscuss the notion of self-awareness in Pride and Prejudice. The characters exist on a kind of spectrum\n(what it calibrates is the notion of being \"sensible\" as opposed to absurd), with Mr Collins at one end and\nElizabeth at the other. Somewhere in between are Darcy, Mr Bennet, Wickham, Jane. Elizabeth's self-\nawareness is clearly connected with her lively sense of the absurdities of others, their lack of awareness of\nhow they reveal themselves in all their limitations to an astute social observer. Self-awareness goes with\nawareness of how one is seen through the eyes of others, then. Yet Elizabeth is often deceived about\nothers--Bingley, Charlotte Lucas, most of all Darcy. Discovering the extent of her misconceptions, she\nregards them as a failure of self-awareness. \"Until this moment I had never fully known myself.\" Is the\nmost self-aware character the most self-deceived?\nYet Elizabeth does know her self--she can be ironic about her capacity for irony (p. 189) when speaking\nwith Jane, see around herself, so to speak, as can her father's sad ironies about his own sense of\nrepentance, when he rejects the comfort that Elizabeth offers him. The way in which Elizabeth tries to\ncomfort Mr Bennet here is a good example of what the text might mean by \"happy manners\", using the\nphrase that is used of Bingley early on. It also shows the limitation of manners, for manners deal with\nsocial roles and a decent regard for the feelings of others, not with truth. It is important to the text that\naccess to the truth about oneself be available; happy manners are necessary but not sufficient for this, and\n(as in the case of Wickham), happy manners can pose a positive danger. Manners produce some distance\nfrom one's social role, because they take into account the viewpoints of others, the interests of others, and\na regard for the judgments that others make (including their judgments of oneself) on the basis of those\ninterests. Characters who are not \"sensible\" have unhappy manners. They are unaware of the judgments\nof others (or wilfully ignore them) and this cannot help but foster a total occupation with their social role\nand the interests that go with it. But manners are based upon fostering an undisturbed surface--they are\nnot to be trusted so far as access to one's \"true self\" is concerned.\nElizabeth is prejudiced against Darcy because he is apparently disdainful at the ball of Netherfield society\nwhere Elizabeth and her family have a measure of social importance. Here is Pride and Prejudice--the\ntitle justified--at one blow! What exactly is the nature of Elizabeth's prejudice and can it be justified?\nWhat is the nature of Darcy's pride (in relation to Elizabeth) and can it be justified? Could the story have\nbeen written the other way about, with the woman proud and the man prejudiced?\n\"Lydia is lost, lost forever!\" The attitude towards Lydia was not the just expression of sexual prurience.\nIt had to do with the position of women in society at the Bennet's level; in marriage, a woman became\n\nmistress of a household but she also came legally under her husband's tutelage and direction. She\nsubmitted herself to her husband in marriage. But woman who shows herself publicly willing to bestow\nsexual favors upon someone not her husband before marriage gives promise of not submitting to her\nhusband's authority after marriage. Mr Collin's letter is absurd as an expression of condolence but it\nfaithfully conveys the attitude of society. Unless Lydia and Wickham marry, Mr Bennet confronts two\nalternatives--either close the possibility of his remaining daughters finding suitable husbands or disown\nLydia entirely, give up their position in Netherfield society and move somewhere where they are not\nknown, and make a fresh start at gaining social reputation late in life.\nConsider Elizabeth's thoughts about conventional morality when she learns that Lydia is to marry\nWickham, after all. \"And they must marry! Yet he is such a man! . . . How strange this is! And for this\nwe must be thankful.\" How closely does she identify with the values of her society?\nIt is often the response of readers making their first acquaintance with Jane Austen that her subject matter\nis so limited--limited to the manners of a small section of English country gentry who never worry\nintently about deep matters of the spirit but largely accept the surface of things--that it can offer little to\ninterest them. Discuss.\nDiscuss the ethical issues raised by \"the problem of the mandarin\" in Pere Goriot in relation to the plot.\nThe Marquis d'Ajuda-Pinto is about to marry Mlle de Rochefilde, but Eugene's cousin, Madame de\nBeauseant, only suspects this is the last person in the world of fashion to know. When Eugene first visits\nher, the Marquis makes a slight movement when he hears the footman announce that a third party is about\nto make an appearance, and Madame de Beauseant guesses at the truth. \"And so it must be recorded that\nMadame de Beauseant had observed her lover's involuntary movement--slight, but so simple as to be\nfrightening\". (p. 71.) Much of the book is concerned with the way in which Eugene learns to interpret\nsuch trifles--small gestures, subtle alterations of tones, a second meaning lurking beneath the apparent\nmeaning of a phrase. Balzac takes it for granted that the reader will understand perfectly why a tiny\ngesture in these particular circumstances may provide evidence for the vicontesse's conclusion. In part,\nthe book is a chronicle of a young man's education in the ways of fashionable society, penetrating\nappearances and learning how to conceal his own feelings. (\"Never let anyone suspect your real\nfeelings,\" says the Vicontesse to him, \"or you'll be lost.\" [p.82]). Take any instance of subtlety in verbal\nexchange or observation by Eugene and show how it works and what Balzac expects his reader to\nunderstand.\nMme de Beauseant says to Eugene that she will lend him her name, which she asks him not to disgrace,\nand then he appeals to his mother and daughters for the means to acquire \"the weapons\" (suitable clothing\nand transportation). It sounds a bit like a knight-errant starting out on his career. The comparison\nbecomes explicit when Delphine sets him up in his own apartment. (p. 207) \"Success is everything in\nParis; it's the key to power.\" What is meant by \"career\" and \"success\" in the context of this book?\nWhy can women be exploited? They crave respectability, while the respectable aristocracy craves\nmoney. All is appearance--but only in Paris; the countryside remains a possibility. The passage on p. 217\nthat declares this speaks of the \"strength to dominate but how or to what end he did not know\". A\nremarkable idea. Compare Don Quixote with the sentiment that follows: in the absence of a pure love,\npower can be a fine thing in itself if pursued for the glory of country.\nThe mutual courtship of male and female in Balzac's high society is a zero-sum game: there's a winner\nand a loser. In the text, women are largely manipulated by men--they are weaker. This is a feature of\nBalzac's fiction--women who can love at all wind up as victims, because sooner or later their beloved\nexploits or betrays them. Women are constant in love, men love and then fall out of love--that is the\nBalzacian general rule. Eugene's story is one version of this. Discuss the role of women of fashion in\n\nPere Goriot--the ability to patronize young men such as Eugene, their susceptibility to being victimized\nby husbands and/or lovers.\nAfter their confrontation in the garden, Eugene thinks of Vautrin: \"That man must have a brain of iron!\nhe told me bluntly exactly what Madame de Beauseant told me in polite phrases. He told me more about\nvirtue than I've ever learned from men or books.\" What are the teachings of Vautrin? How would you\nelucidate his character and the kind of temptation that he represents? Are his views, indeed, endorsed by\nMme de Beauseant in the speech to which Eugene refers?\nAt one point, Balzac announces the theme of his book as tracing \"the devious ways by which an\nambitious man of the world gets the better of his conscience as he tries to skirt round evil, so as to achieve\nhis aim while preserving appearances . . .\" (pp. 129-30.) Is this the theme? Elucidate.\nVautrin: Virtue is indivisible--hence go all the way to crime. True? Goriot: they are commiting all\ncrimes in this one. True?\nBalzac pretty clearly had King Lear in mind when writing Pere Goriot, but even if he didn=t, the\ncomparison forces itself upon one=s attention. Discuss it in any way that seems useful, perhaps by starting\nfrom the sentiment just cited by Goriot, which was made on his death-bed.\nDiscuss the idea of heroism in any text read so far this term. (Don't ask: what do you mean by \"heroism\"?\nOr: do you mean the hero of a book or heroics in life? Resolving ambiguities is your job.)\nNietzsche says that you need a history of morality to understand it. What does he think you learn about\nmorality from its history? Outline the history that he offers in as much detail as possible. (You can\nderive some clues about this in the next paragraph.) Later he apparently says that knowing the origin of a\nthing and understanding its current purpose are world's apart--the former has no bearing on the latter and\nvice-versa. A careful reading shows that the apparent contradiction here does not run deep. How would\nyou account for it?\nNietzsche is scornful of the \"scientific\" moralists of his dayBhe sometimes calls them Apsychologists@. He\nsees them as unwittingly projecting upon nature characteristics that are late development of social\nexistence. This, in turn, leads him also to refuse to take certain things for granted and to insist that they\nbe posed as problems--something whose existence calls for explanation, even where it looks unlikely that\nwe could ever supply any. Nietzsche wants to take the ability to promise--to go surety for oneself--as\nsuch a puzzle, also the wish to take revenge, the feelings of bad conscience or guilt, above all, as he puts\nit, \"the existence on earth of an animal soul turned against itself, taking sides against itself.\" In the latter,\nparticularly, we can see that he will not accept explanations such as Hobbes offers, which depend upon\nthe notion that being moral is \"at bottom\" or \"really\" a matter of enlightened self-interest. Comment.\nNietzsche sees the pre-reactive man (the blond beast) as affirming himself, deriving his values from his\nsense of his own worth, and the (modern) reactive man as deriving his sense of his self from his denial of\nthe value of another. At the same time, Nietzsche says the reactive man not only hates what is not himself\nbut he hates himself as well, \"takes sides against himself.\" Is there a contradiction here?\nDoes Nietzsche's project of examining the value of values make sense? Is it like asking why some\naccepted value or other is really valuable? Or is Nietzsche trying to examine the value of the idea of\n\"value\" itself? In that case, how is this possible? (In the realm of morality, it may be like asking why we\nought to do what we ought to do.) Other writers after Nietzsche raised this question by way of\nintroducing a general skepticism about moral values--i.e., if values could always be questioned in the\nname of other values, then perhaps there were no universal values, but only particulars masquerading as\n\nuniversal values. Is this Nietzsche's position? In other hands, the skeptical version of the question\n\"What's the good of being good?\" implied straightaway that there was much to be gained from being bad\nand no reason not to be bad except the risk of being found out by one's fellows. (Hobbes puts the matter\nin this way.) Nietzsche has often been accused of licensing this kind of thinking. Does the accusation\nstick?\nOutline the general character of Nietzsche's argument by elucidating the distinction between \"bad\" and\n\"evil\" as Nietzsche presents it. Try to explain where the idea of \"innocence\" (unlike \"guilt\" not a central\ntheme in Nietzsche, but certain present in the text) might fit into his view of things.\nHobbes believes in equality as a value; Nietzsche believes deeply in inequality. Compare Nietzsche's\nviews with those of Hobbes and/or Machiavelli on this point.\nHe is aut Nietzsche looks forward to the coming of a kind of human being who does not follow the\nmorality of custom--that is to say, the dictates of accepted morality--but obeys only his own rules.\nonomous--that is to say, he is free but he is truly responsible, as those who are follow customary morality\nare not, because he can bind himself to his own rules. \"Autonomous\" and \"moral\" are mutually exclusive,\nsays Nietzsche. Does this idea of \"true\" responsibility make sense? How close is Nietzsche-ism to the\nviews that Vautrin expounded to Eugene in Pere Goriot?\nOutline the general character of Nietzsche's argument by elucidating the distinction between \"bad\" and\n\"evil\" as Nietzsche presents it. Try to explain where the idea of \"innocence\" (not a central theme in\nNietzsche) might fit into his view of things.\nNietzsche offers a genealogy--that is, an account of the origin and transmission--of certain values: in the\ncase of Nietzsche, what he takes to be the essence of morality--namely, a set of principles whose\nfundamental premise is that you ought to be a different sort of person. Genealogies normally are offered\nin connection with notion bearing upon honor--namely, one's membership in a group (usually, a family)\nof whose position and accomplishments one is proud and whose values are adopted as an ideal to live up\nto. In the case of Nietzsche, the genealogy is of values that the writer means to discredit, and the\ngenealogy is offered in order to discredit them. Nietzsche sees the present as a time at which individuals\ntypically derive their sense of themselves reactively--that is, in response to the attitudes taken towards\nthem by others. And he sees the time before the present stage of humanity as one at which (to a lesser or\ngreater degree as one moves backwards from the present) human beings were not particularly regardful of\nothers, either positively or negatively. Nietzsche also sees the present as a stage in the development of a\nnew sort of human being, a supra-moral person, who measures up only to himself. Comment.\nNietzsche's project resembles Rousseau's in another sense. Both regard most accounts of human nature as\nunwittingly projecting upon nature characteristics that are actually not natural but late developments of\nsocial existence. This leads them each to regard these characteristics as puzzles--things whose existence\ncalls for explanation, even where it looks unlikely that we could ever supply one. (Rousseau's instances\nwere language, property, metallurgy and farming.) Nietzsche wants to take the ability to promise--to go\nsurety for oneself--as such a puzzle; also the wish to take revenge, the feelings of bad conscience or guilt,\nabove all, as he puts it, \"the existence on earth of an animal soul turned against itself, taking sides against\nitself.\" (p. 1272.) In the latter, particularly, we can see that he will not accept explanations such as\nHobbes offers, which depend upon the notion that being moral is \"at bottom\" or \"really\" a matter of\nenlightened self-interest. Comment.\nNietzsche sees the pre-reactive man (the blond beast) as affirming himself, deriving his values from his\nsense of his own worth, and the (modern) reactive man as deriving his sense of his self from his denial of\nthe value of another. At the same time, Nietzsche says the reactive man not only hates what is not himself\n\nbut he hates himself as well, \"takes sides against himself.\" Is there a contradiction here?\nDiscuss the main themes of Major Barbara as you see them. Undershaft says that religion is the only\ninteresting subject for intelligent people.\nLady Britomart says that it is not a proper subject for\ndiscussion. What does each mean by this? What does Undershaft mean when he says that his religion is\nbeing a millionaire? Or, to put it another way, Undershaft, like Barbara, believes in the need for\nsalvation, but what one has to be saved from is different for each of them.\nUndershaft says that each person has his own true morality--that one person's meat is another's person's\npoison morally as well as physically. Lomax simply agrees, as if everyone knows this, but Stephen\nobjects--there is, he says, only one true morality and anyone who believes otherwise is a scoundrel. Who\nis right, in the view of the play? How does this issue reflect the concerns of the play as a whole?\nUndershaft rejects the values of Christianity--poverty, humility, and turning the other cheek. The play\nshows that this are powerful values; Bill Walker has a hard time standing out against them. Does\nUndershaft represent a superior sort of man?\nUndershaft makes armaments--weapons. This catches a metaphor that runs deep in the Western tradition,\nas when we say that truth is our best weapon. Why do we need weapons? What justifies the metaphor?\nShaw wrote this play before it became clear that weapons of mass destruction would be normally used in\nwarfare against civilian personnel; he still believed that they would be used against other military forces,\nwho were also armed to the teeth and prepared to use their weapons. This fact apart, why is it appropriate\nto the play's concerns that he is a manufacturer of weapons? Why not (like Bodger) a manufacturer of\nsomething else that might be regarded as evil, like whiskey or tobacco? Would that do as well?\nCusins nicknames Undershaft \"Machiavelli\". Why? Lady Britomart says that she couldn't bear the fact\nthat he practiced morality while preaching immorality. What she means is also put by saying that he\nalways gives a bad reason for doing something good--as when he insists that his charitable contribution to\nthe Salvation Army remain anonymous. Practicing morality while preaching immorality sounds the dead\nopposite of Machiavelli's advice to the Prince. Discuss.\nDiscuss or compare the idea of vocation, calling, or career in one or more of the following (at least one\nchosen from the last third of the term): Wordsworth's Prelude, Balzac=s Pere Goriot, Shaw's Major\nBarbara."

      "content": "21L002-2\nSpring 2003\nFoundations of Western Culture II: Renaissance to Modernity\nI. MACHIAVELLI:\na. Text: original translation in the public domain.\nLecture #1 THE PRINCE by Nicolo Machiavelli [1515]\nAdapted from the translation of W. K. Marriott by A. C. Kibel\nCHAPTER XIV:\nTHAT WHICH CONCERNS A PRINCE ON THE SUBJECT OF THE ART OF WAR\nA PRINCE ought to have no other aim or thought, nor select anything else for his study, than war\nand its rules and discipline; for this is the sole art that belongs to him who rules, and it is of such force\nthat it not only upholds those who are born princes, but it often enables men to rise from a private station\nto that rank. And, on the contrary, it is seen that when princes have thought more of ease than of arms\nthey have lost their states. And the first cause of your losing it is to neglect this art; and what enables you\nto acquire a state is to be master of the art. Francesco Sforza, through being martial, from a private person\nbecame Duke of Milan; and the sons, through avoiding the hardships and troubles of arms, from dukes\nbecame private persons. For among other evils which being unarmed brings you, it causes you to be\ndespised, and this is one of those ignominies against which a prince ought to guard himself, as is shown\nlater on. Because there is nothing proportionate between the armed and the unarmed; and it is not\nreasonable that he who is armed should yield obedience willingly to him who is unarmed, or that the\nunarmed man should be secure among armed servants. Because, there being in the one disdain and in the\nother suspicion, it is not possible for them to work well together. And therefore a prince who does not\nunderstand the art of war, over and above the other misfortunes already mentioned, cannot be respected\nby his soldiers, nor can he rely on them. He ought never, therefore, to have out of his thoughts this subject\nof war, and in peace he should addict himself more to its exercise than in war; this he can do in two ways,\nthe one by action, the other by study.\nAs regards action, he ought above all things to keep his men well organized and drilled, to follow\nincessantly the chase, by which he accustoms his body to hardships, and learns something of the nature of\nlocalities, and gets to find out how the mountains rise, how the valleys open out, how the plains lie, and to\nunderstand the nature of rivers and marshes, and in all this to take the greatest care. Which knowledge is\nuseful in two ways. Firstly, he learns to know his country, and is better able to undertake its defence;\nafterwards, by means of the knowledge and observation of that locality, he understands with ease any\nother which it may be necessary for him to study hereafter; because the hills, valleys, and plains, and\nrivers and marshes that are, for instance, in Tuscany, have a certain resemblance to those of other\ncountries, so that with a knowledge of the aspect of one country one can easily arrive at a knowledge of\nothers. And the prince that lacks this skill lacks the essential which it is desirable that a captain should\npossess, for it teaches him to surprise his enemy, to select quarters, to lead armies, to array the battle, to\nbesiege towns to advantage.\n\nPhilopoemen, Prince of the Achaeans, among other praises which writers have bestowed on him,\nis commended because in time of peace he never had anything in his mind but the rules of war; and when\nhe was in the country with friends, he often stopped and reasoned with them: \"If the enemy should be\nupon that hill, and we should find ourselves here with our army, with whom would be the advantage?\nHow should one best advance to meet him, keeping the ranks? If we should wish to retreat, how ought we\nto set about it? If they should retreat, how ought we to pursue?\" And he would set forth to them, as he\nwent, all the chances that could befall an army; he would listen to their opinion and state his, confirming\nit with reasons, so that by these continual discussions there could never arise, in time of war, any\nunexpected circumstances that he could deal with.\nBut to exercise the intellect the prince should read histories, and study there the actions of\nillustrious men, to see how they have borne themselves in war, to examine the causes of their victories\nand defeat, so as to avoid the latter and imitate the former; and above all do as an illustrious man did, who\ntook as an exemplar one who had been praised and famous before him, and whose achievements and\ndeeds he always kept in his mind, as it is said Alexander the Great imitated Achilles, Caesar Alexander,\nScipio Cyrus. And whoever reads the life of Cyrus, written by Xenophon, will recognize afterwards in the\nlife of Scipio how that imitation was his glory, and how in chastity, affability, humanity, and liberality\nScipio conformed to those things which have been written of Cyrus by Xenophon. A wise prince ought to\nobserve some such rules, and never in peaceful times stand idle, but increase his resources with industry\nin such a way that they may be available to him in adversity, so that if fortune changes it may find him\nprepared to resist her blows.\nCHAPTER XV:\nCONCERNING THINGS FOR WHICH MEN, AND ESPECIALLY PRINCES, ARE PRAISED OR\nBLAMED\nIT REMAINS now to see what ought to be the rules of conduct for a prince towards subject and\nfriends. And as I know that many have written on this point, I expect I shall be considered presumptuous\nin mentioning it again, especially as in discussing it I shall depart from the methods of other people. But,\nit being my intention to write a thing which shall be useful to him who apprehends it, it appears to me\nmore appropriate to follow up the real truth of a matter than the imagination of it; for many have pictured\nrepublics and principalities which in fact have never been known or seen, because how one lives is so far\ndistant from how one ought to live, that he who neglects what is done for what ought to be done, sooner\neffects his ruin than his preservation; for a man who wishes to act entirely up to his professions of virtue\nsoon meets with what destroys him among so much that is evil.\nHence it is necessary for a prince wishing to hold his own to know how not to be good, and to use\nthis knowledge or not use it according to the necessity of the case. Therefore, putting on one side\nimaginary things concerning a prince, and discussing those which are real, I say that all men when they\nare spoken of, and chiefly princes for being more highly placed, are remarkable for some of those\nqualities which bring them either blame or praise; and thus it is that one is reputed liberal, another\nmiserly, using a Tuscan term (because an avaricious person in our language is still he who desires to\npossess by robbery, whilst we call one miserly who deprives himself too much of the use of his own); one\nis reputed generous, one rapacious; one cruel, one compassionate; one faithless, another faithful; one\neffeminate and cowardly, another bold and brave; one affable, another haughty; one lascivious, another\nchaste; one sincere, another cunning; one hard, another easy; one grave, another frivolous; one religious,\nanother unbelieving, and the like. And I know that every one will confess that it would be most\npraiseworthy in a prince to exhibit all the above qualities that are considered good; but because they can\nneither be entirely possessed nor observed, for human conditions do not permit it, it is necessary for him\nto be sufficiently prudent that he may know how to avoid the reproach of those vices which would lose\n\nhim his state; and also to keep himself, if it be possible, from those which would not lose him it; but this\nnot being possible, he may with less hesitation abandon himself to them. And again, he need not make\nhimself uneasy at incurring a reproach for those vices without which the state can only be saved with\ndifficulty, for if everything is considered carefully, it will be found that something which looks like\nvirtue, if followed, would be his ruin; whilst something else, which looks like vice, yet followed brings\nhim security and prosperity.\nCHAPTER XVI\nCONCERNING LIBERALITY AND MEANNESS\nCOMMENCING then with the first of the above-named characteristics, I say that it would be\nwell to be reputed liberal. Nevertheless, liberality exercised in a way that does not bring you the\nreputation for it, injures you; for if one exercises it honestly and as it should be exercised, it may not\nbecome known, and you will not avoid the reproach of its opposite. Therefore, any one wishing to\nmaintain among men the name of liberal is obliged to avoid no attribute of magnificence; so that a prince\nthus inclined will consume in such acts all his property, and will be compelled in the end, if he wish to\nmaintain the name of liberal, to unduly weigh down his people, and tax them, and do everything he can to\nget money. This will soon make him odious to his subjects, and becoming poor he will be little valued by\nany one; thus, with his liberality, having offended many and rewarded few, he is affected by the very first\ntrouble and imperilled by whatever may be the first danger; recognizing this himself, and wishing to draw\nback from it, he runs at once into the reproach of being miserly.\nTherefore, a prince, not being able to exercise this virtue of liberality in such a way that it is\nrecognized, except to his cost, if he is wise he ought not to fear the reputation of being mean, for in time\nhe will come to be more considered than if liberal, seeing that with his economy his revenues are enough,\nthat he can defend himself against all attacks, and is able to engage in enterprises without burdening his\npeople; thus it comes to pass that he exercises liberality towards all from whom he does not take, who are\nnumberless, and meanness towards those to whom he does not give, who are few.\nWe have not seen great things done in our time except by those who have been considered mean;\nthe rest have failed. Pope Julius the Second was assisted in reaching the papacy by a reputation for\nliberality, yet he did not strive afterwards to keep it up, when he made war on the King of France; and he\nmade many wars without imposing any extraordinary tax on his subjects, for he supplied his additional\nexpenses out of his long thriftiness. The present King of Spain would not have undertaken or conquered\nin so many enterprises if he had been reputed liberal. A prince, therefore, provided that he has not to rob\nhis subjects, that he can defend himself, that he does not become poor and abject, that he is not forced to\nbecome rapacious, ought to hold of little account a reputation for being mean, for it is one of those vices\nwhich will enable him to govern.\nAnd if any one should say: Caesar obtained empire by liberality, and many others have reached\nthe highest positions by having been liberal, and by being considered so, I answer: Either you are a prince\nin fact, or in a way to become one. In the first case this liberality is dangerous, in the second it is very\nnecessary to be considered liberal; and Caesar was one of those who wished to become pre-eminent in\nRome; but if he had survived after becoming so, and had not moderated his expenses, he would have\ndestroyed his government. And if any one should reply: Many have been princes, and have done great\nthings with armies, who have been considered very liberal, I reply: Either a prince spends that which is\nhis own or his subjects' or else that of others. In the first case he ought to be sparing, in the second he\nought not to neglect any opportunity for liberality. And to the price who goes forth with his army,\nsupporting it by pillage, sack, and extortion, handling that which belongs to others, this liberality is\nnecessary, otherwise he would not be followed by soldiers. And of that which is neither yours nor your\nsubjects' you can be a ready giver, as were Cyrus, Caesar, and Alexander; because it does not take away\n\nyour reputation if you squander that of others, but adds to it; it is only squandering your own that injures\nyou.\nAnd there is nothing wastes so rapidly as liberality, for even whilst you exercise it you lose the\npower to do so, and so become either poor or despised, or else, in avoiding poverty, rapacious and hated.\nAnd a prince should guard himself, above all things, against being despised and hated; and liberality leads\nyou to both. Therefore it is wiser to have a reputation for meanness which brings reproach without hatred,\nthan to be compelled through seeking a reputation for liberality to incur a name for rapacity which begets\nreproach with hatred.\nCHAPTER XVII\nCONCERNING CRUELTY AND CLEMENCY, AND WHETHER IT IS BETTER TO BE LOVED\nTHAN FEARED\nCOMING now to the other qualities mentioned above, I say that every prince ought to desire to\nbe considered clement and not cruel. Nevertheless he ought to take care not to misuse this clemency.\nCesare Borgia was considered cruel; notwithstanding, his cruelty reconciled the Romagna, unified it, and\nrestored it to peace and loyalty. And if this be rightly considered, he will be seen to have been much more\nmerciful than the Florentine people, who, to avoid a reputation for cruelty, permitted Pistoia to be\ndestroyed. Therefore a prince, so long as he keeps his subjects united and loyal, ought not to mind the\nreproach of cruelty; because with a few examples he will be more merciful than those who, through too\nmuch mercy, allow disorders to arise, from which follow murders or robberies; for these are wont to\ninjure the whole people, whilst those executions which originate with a prince offend the individual only.\nAnd of all princes, it is impossible for the new prince to avoid the imputation of cruelty, owing to\nnew states being full of dangers. Hence Virgil, through the mouth of Dido, excuses the inhumanity of her\nreign owing to its being new, saying:\nRes dura, et regni novitas me talia cogunt\nMoliri, et late fines custode tueri.1\nNevertheless he ought to be slow to believe and to act, nor should he himself show fear, but\nproceed in a temperate manner with prudence and humanity, so that too much confidence may not make\nhim incautious and too much distrust render him intolerable.\n1. ...against my will, my fate, / A throne unsettled, and an infant state, / Bid me defend my realms\nwith all my pow'rs, / And guard with these severities my shores.\n\nUpon this a question arises: whether it be better to be loved than feared or feared than loved? It\nmay be answered that one should wish to be both, but, because it is difficult to unite them in one person,\nis much safer to be feared than loved, when, of the two, either must be dispensed with. Because this is to\nbe asserted in general of men, that they are ungrateful, fickle, false, cowardly, covetous, and as long as\nyou succeed they are yours entirely; they will offer you their blood, property, life and children, as is said\nabove, when the need is far distant; but when it approaches they turn against you. And that prince who,\nrelying entirely on their promises, has neglected other precautions, is ruined; because friendships that are\nobtained by payments, and not by greatness or nobility of mind, may indeed be earned, but they are not\nsecured, and in time of need cannot be relied upon; and men have less scruple in offending one who is\nbeloved than one who is feared, for love is preserved by the link of obligation which, owing to the\nbaseness of men, is broken at every opportunity for their advantage; but fear preserves you by a dread of\npunishment which never fails.\nNevertheless a prince ought to inspire fear in such a way that, if he does not win love, he avoids\nhatred; because he can endure very well being feared whilst he is not hated, which will always be as long\nas he abstains from the property of his citizens and subjects and from their women. But when it is\nnecessary for him to proceed against the life of someone, he must do it on proper justification and for\nmanifest cause, but above all things he must keep his hands off the property of others, because men more\neasily forget the death of their father than the loss of their patrimony. Besides, pretexts for taking away\nthe property are never wanting; for he who has once begun to live by robbery will always find pretexts for\nseizing what belongs to others; but reasons for taking life, on the contrary, are more difficult to find and\nsooner lapse. But when a prince is with his army, and has under control a multitude of soldiers, then it is\nquite necessary for him to disregard the reputation of cruelty, for without it he would never hold his army\nunited or disposed to its duties.\nAmong the wonderful deeds of Hannibal this one is enumerated: that having led an enormous\narmy, composed of many various races of men, to fight in foreign lands, no dissensions arose either\namong them or against the prince, whether in his bad or in his good fortune. This arose from nothing else\nthan his inhuman cruelty, which, with his boundless valor, made him revered and terrible in the sight of\nhis soldiers, but without that cruelty, his other virtues were not sufficient to produce this effect. And\nshortsighted writers admire his deeds from one point of view and from another condemn the principal\ncause of them. That it is true his other virtues would not have been sufficient for him may be proved by\nthe case of Scipio, that most excellent man, not of his own times but within the memory of man, against\nwhom, nevertheless, his army rebelled in Spain; this arose from nothing but his too great forbearance,\nwhich gave his soldiers more licence than is consistent with military discipline. For this he was upbraided\nin the Senate by Fabius Maximus, and called the corrupter of the Roman soldiery. The Locrians were laid\nwaste by a legate of Scipio, yet they were not avenged by him, nor was the insolence of the legate\npunished, owing entirely to his easy nature. Insomuch that someone in the Senate, wishing to excuse him,\nsaid there were many men who knew much better how not to err than to correct the errors of others. This\ndisposition, if he had been continued in the command, would have destroyed in time the fame and glory\nof Scipio; but, he being under the control of the Senate, this injurious characteristic not only concealed\nitself, but contributed to his glory.\nReturning to the question of being feared or loved, I come to the conclusion that, men loving\naccording to their own will and fearing according to that of the prince, a wise prince should establish\nhimself on that which is in his own control and not in that of others; he must endeavor only to avoid\nhatred, as is noted.\nCHAPTER XVIII\nCONCERNING THE WAY IN WHICH PRINCES SHOULD KEEP FAITH\n\nEVERY one admits how praiseworthy it is in a prince to keep faith, and to live with integrity and\nnot with craft. Nevertheless our experience has been that those princes who have done great things have\nheld good faith of little account, and have known how to circumvent the intellect of men by craft, and in\nthe end have overcome those who have relied on their word. You must know there are two ways of\ncontesting, the one by the law, the other by force; the first method is proper to men, the second to beasts;\nbut because the first is frequently not sufficient, it is necessary to have recourse to the second. Therefore it\nis necessary for a prince to understand how to avail himself of the beast and the man. This has been\nfiguratively taught to princes by ancient writers, who describe how Achilles and many other princes of\nold were given to the Centaur Chiron to nurse, who brought them up in his discipline; which means solely\nthat, as they had for a teacher one who was half beast and half man, so it is necessary for a prince to know\nhow to make use of both natures, and that one without the other is not durable.\nA prince, therefore, being compelled knowingly to adopt the beast, ought to choose the fox and\nthe lion; because the lion cannot defend himself against snares and the fox cannot defend himself against\nwolves. Therefore, it is necessary to be a fox to discover the snares and a lion to terrify the wolves. Those\nwho rely simply on the lion do not understand what they are about. Therefore a wise lord cannot, nor\nought he to, keep faith when such observance may be turned against him, and when the reasons that\ncaused him to pledge it exist no longer. If men were entirely good this precept would not hold, but\nbecause they are bad, and will not keep faith with you, you too are not bound to observe it with them. Nor\nwill there ever be wanting to a prince legitimate reasons to excuse this nonobservance. Of these endless\nmodern examples could be given, showing how many treaties and engagements have been made void and\nof no effect through the faithlessness of princes; and he who has known best how to employ the fox has\nsucceeded best.\nBut it is necessary to know well how to disguise this characteristic and to be a great pretender and\ndissembler; and men are so simple, and so ready to obey to present necessities, that he who seeks to\ndeceive will always find someone who will allow himself to be deceived. One recent example I cannot\npass over in silence. Alexander VI did nothing else but deceive men, nor ever thought of doing otherwise,\nand he always found victims; for there never was a man who had greater power in asserting, or who with\ngreater oaths would affirm a thing, yet would observe it less; nevertheless his deceits always succeeded\naccording to his wishes, because he well understood this side of mankind.\nTherefore it is unnecessary for a prince to have all the good qualities I have enumerated, but it is\nvery necessary to appear to have them. And I shall dare to say this also, that to have them and always to\nobserve them is injurious, and that to appear to have them is useful; to appear merciful, faithful, humane,\nreligious, forthright, and to be so, but with a mind so framed that should you require not to be so, you may\nbe able and know how to change to the opposite.\nAnd you have to understand this, which a prince, especially a new one, cannot observe all those\nthings for which men are esteemed, being often forced, in order to maintain the state, to act contrary to\nfaith, friendship, humanity, and religion. Therefore it is necessary for him to have a mind ready to turn\nitself accordingly as the winds and variations of fortune force it, yet, as I have said above, not to diverge\nfrom the good if he can avoid doing so, but, if compelled, then to know how to set about it.\n\nFor this reason a prince ought to take care that he never lets anything slip from his lips\nthat is not replete with the above-named five qualities, that he may appear to him who sees and\nhears him altogether merciful, faithful, humane, forthright, and religious. There is nothing more\nnecessary to appear to have than this last quality, inasmuch as men judge generally more by the\neye than by the hand, because it belongs to everybody to see you, to few to come in touch with\nyou. Every one sees what you appear to be, few really know what you are, and those few dare not\noppose themselves to the opinion of the many, who have the majesty of the state to defend them;\nand in the actions of all men, and especially of princes, from which there is no appeal, the end\njustifies the means..\nFor that reason, let a prince have the credit of conquering and holding his state, the means\nwill always be considered honest, and he will be praised by everybody because the vulgar are\nalways taken by what a thing seems to be and by what comes of it; and in the world there are only\nthe vulgar, for the few find a place there only when the many have no ground to rest on.\nOne prince of the present time, whom it is not well to name, never preaches anything else\nbut peace and good faith, and to both he is most hostile, and either, if he had kept it, would have\ndeprived him of reputation and kingdom many a time."

Text: original translation in the public domain.\nLecture #2: UTOPIA\nby SIR THOMAS MORE (1516)\n(Excerpts adapted from the Burnet translation by A. C. Kibel)\nBOOK I\nHENRY VIII, the unconquered King of England, a prince adorned with all the virtues that\nbecome a great monarch, having some differences of no small consequence with Charles, the most serene\nPrince of Castile, sent me into Flanders, as his ambassador, for treating and composing matters between\nthem. I was colleague and companion to that incomparable man Cuthbert Tunstall, whom the King with\nsuch universal applause lately made Master of the Rolls, but of whom I will say nothing; not because I\nfear that the testimony of a friend will be suspected, but rather because his learning and virtues are too\ngreat for me to do them justice, and so well known that they need not my praise. Those appointed by the\nPrince to treat with us met us at Bruges, according to agreement; they were all worthy men. The Mayor of\nBruges was their head, and the chief man among them; but he that was esteemed the wisest, and that\nspoke for the rest, was George Temse, the Provost of Casselsea; both art and nature had concurred to\nmake him eloquent: he was learned in law; and as he had a great capacity, so by a long practice in affairs\nhe was very skillful at unraveling them.\nAfter we had several times met without coming to an agreement, they went to Brussels for some\ndays to know the Prince=s pleasure. And since our business would admit it, I went to Antwerp. While I\nwas there, among many that visited me, there was one that was more acceptable to me than any other,\nPeter Giles, born at Antwerp, who is a man of great honor, and of a good rank in his town, though less\nthan he deserves; for I do not know if there be anywhere to be found a more learned and a better bred\nyoung man: for as he is both a very worthy and a very knowing person, so he is so civil to all men, so\nparticularly kind to his friends, and so full of candor and affection, that there is not perhaps above one or\ntwo anywhere to be found that are in all respects so perfect a friend. He is extraordinarily modest, there is\nno artifice in him; and yet no man has more of a prudent simplicity: his conversation was so pleasant and\nso innocently cheerful, that his company in a great measure lessened any longings to go back to my\ncountry, and to my wife and children, which an absence of four months had quickened very much. One\nday as I was returning home from mass at St. Mary=s, which is the chief church, and the most frequented\nof any in Antwerp, I saw him by accident talking with a stranger, who seemed past the flower of his age;\nhis face was tanned, he had a long beard, and his cloak was hanging carelessly about him, so that by his\nlooks and habit I concluded he was a seaman.\nAs soon as Peter saw me, he came and saluted me; and as I was returning his civility, he took me\naside, and pointing to him with whom he had been discoursing, he said: ADo you see that man? I was just\nthinking to bring him to you.@\nI answered, AHe should have been very welcome on your account.@\nAAnd on his own too,@ replied he, Aif you knew the man, for there is none alive that can give so\n\ncopious an account of unknown nations and countries as he can do; which I know you very much desire.@\nThen said I, AI did not guess amiss, for at first sight I took him for a seaman.@\nABut you are much mistaken,@ said he, Afor he has not sailed as a seaman, but as a traveler, or\nrather a philosopher. This Raphael, who from his family carries the name of Sillysense1, is not ignorant of\nthe Latin tongue, but is eminently learned in the Greek, having applied himself more particularly to that\nthan to the former, because he had given himself much to philosophy, in which he knew that the Romans\nhave left us nothing that is valuable, except what is to be found in Seneca and Cicero. He is a Portuguese\nby birth, and was so desirous of seeing the world that he divided his estate among his brothers, ran the\nsame hazard as AmerigoVespucci, and bore a share in three of his four voyages, that are now published;\nonly he did not return with him in his last, but obtained leave of him almost by force, that he might be one\nof those twenty-four who were left at the farthest place at which they touched, in their last voyage to New\nCastile. The leaving him thus did not a little gratify one that was more fond of traveling than of returning\nhome to be buried in his own country; for he used often to say that the way to heaven was the same from\nall places; and he that had no grave had the heaven still over him. Yet this disposition of mind had cost\nhim dear, if God had not been very gracious to him; for after he, with five Castilians, had traveled over\nmany countries, at last, by strange good-fortune, he got to Ceylon, and from thence to Calcutta, where he\nvery happily found some Portuguese ships, and, beyond all men=s expectations, returned to his native\ncountry.@\nWhen Peter had said this to me, I thanked him for his kindness, in intending to give me the\nacquaintance of a man whose conversation he knew would be so acceptable; and upon that Raphael and I\nembraced each other. After those civilities were passed which are usual with strangers upon their first\nmeeting, we all went to my house, and entering into the garden, sat down on a green bank, and entertained\none another in discourse. He told us that when Vespucci had sailed away, he and his companions that\nstayed behind in New Castile, by degrees insinuated themselves into the affections of the people of the\ncountry, meeting often with them, and treating them gently: and at last they not only lived among them\nwithout danger, but conversed familiarly with them; and got so far into the heart of a prince, whose name\nand country I have forgot, that he both furnished them plentifully with all things necessary, and also with\nthe conveniences of traveling; both boats when they went by water, and wagons when they traveled over\nland: he sent with them a very faithful guide, who was to introduce and recommend them to such other\nprinces as they had a mind to see: and after many days= journey, they came to towns and commonwealths\nthat were both happily governed and well-peopled.\n1The names attributed to Utopian people and institutions in the original Latin text are composed of Greek\nroots, for which this text provides crude English equivalents. Raphael=s last name in the original is Hythloday,\nwhich might be more accurately translated as Asower of nonsense@.\n\nIt seems that under the equator, and as far on both sides of it as the sun moves, there lay vast\ndeserts that were parched with the perpetual heat of the sun; the soil was withered, all things looked\ndismally, and all places were either quite uninhabited, or abounded with wild beasts and serpents, and\nsome few men that were neither less wild nor less cruel than the beasts themselves. But as they went\nfarther, a new scene opened, all things grew milder, the air less burning, the soil more verdant, and even\nthe beasts were less wild: and at last there were nations, towns, and towns, that had not only mutual\ncommerce among themselves, and with their neighbors, but traded both by sea and land, to very remote\ncountries. There they found opportunities to see many countries near and far, for no ship went any voyage\ninto which he and his companions were not very welcome. The first vessels that they saw were\nflat-bottomed, their sails were made of reeds and wicker woven close together, only some were of leather;\nbut afterward they found ships made with round keels and canvas sails, and in all respects like our ships;\nand the seamen understood both astronomy and navigation. He got wonderfully into their favor, by\nshowing them the use of the magnetic compass, of which till then they were utterly ignorant. They sailed\nbefore with great caution, and only in summer-time, but now they count all seasons alike, trusting wholly\nto their compasses, in which they feel perhaps more secure than they are actually safe; so that there is\nreason to fear that this discovery, which was thought would prove so much to their advantage, may by\ntheir imprudence become an occasion of mischief to them.\nBut it were too long to dwell on all that he told us he had observed in every place, it would be too\ngreat a digression from our present purpose: whatever is necessary to be told, concerning those wise and\nprudent institutions which he observed among civilized nations, may perhaps be related by us on a more\nproper occasion. We asked him many questions concerning all these things, to which he answered very\nwillingly; only we made no inquiries after monsters, than which nothing is more common; for everywhere\none may hear of huge, ravenous monsters that gobble down people; but it is not so easy to find citizens\nwho are well and wisely governed.\nAs he told us of many things that were amiss in those new-discovered countries, so he reckoned\nup not a few things to serve as patterns for correcting the errors of our own kingdoms and nations; of\nwhich an account may be given, as I have already promised, at some other time; for at present I intend\nonly to relate those particulars that he told us of the manners and laws of the Utopians; but I will begin\nwith the occasion that led us to speak of that commonwealth. After Raphael had discoursed with great\njudgment on the many errors that were both among us and these nations; had treated of the wise\ninstitutions both here and there, and had spoken as distinctly of the customs and government of every\nnation through which he had passed, as if he had spent his whole life in it, Peter, being struck with\nadmiration, said: AI wonder, Raphael, how it comes that you enter into no king=s service, for I am sure\nthere are none to whom you would not be very acceptable: for your learning and knowledge both of men\nand things, are such that you would not only entertain them very pleasantly, but be of great use to them,\nby the examples you could set before them and the advices you could give them; and by this means you\nwould both serve your own interest and be of great use to all your friends.@\nAAs for my friends,@ answered he, AI need not be much concerned, having already done for them\nall that was incumbent on me; for when I was not only in good health, but fresh and young, I distributed\nthat among my kindred and friends which other people do not part with till they are old and sick, when\nthey then unwillingly give that which they can enjoy no longer themselves. I think my friends ought to\nrest contented with this, and not to expect that for their sake I should enslave myself to any king\nwhatsoever.@\nASoft and fair,@ said Peter, AI do not mean that you should be a slave to any king, but only that\nyou should advise him and be useful.@\nAA change of wording,@ said he, Adoes not change the matter.@\n\n\"But term it as you will,\" replied Peter, \"I do not see any other way in which you can be so useful,\nboth in private to your friends, and to the public, and by which you can make your own condition\nhappier.\"\n\"Happier!\" answered Raphael; \"is that to be managed in a way so abhorrent to my genius? Now I\nlive as I will, to which I believe few courtiers can pretend. And there are so many that court the favor of\ngreat men, that there will be no great loss if they are not troubled either with me or with others of my\ntemper.\"\nUpon this, said I: \"I perceive, Raphael, that you neither desire wealth nor greatness; and indeed I\nvalue and admire such a man much more than I do any of the great men in the world. Yet I think you\nwould do what would well become so generous and philosophical a soul as yours is, if you would apply\nyour time and thoughts to public affairs, even though you may find it a little uncomfortable yourself: and\nthis you can never do with so much good effect as to become counselor to some great prince, encouraging\nhim to noble and worthy actions, which I know you would do if you were in such a post; for the springs\nboth of good and evil flow from the prince as from a lasting fountain over a whole people. So much\nlearning as you have, even without practice in affairs, or so great a practice as you have had, without any\nother learning, would render you a very fit counselor to any king whatsoever.\"\n\"You are doubly mistaken,\" said he, \"Mr. More, both in your opinion of me, and in the judgment\nyou make of things: for as I have not that capacity that you fancy I have, so, if I had it, the public would\nnot be one jot the better, when I had sacrificed my quiet to it. . . . Plato judged right, that except kings\nthemselves became philosophers, they who from their childhood are corrupted with false notions would\nnever fall in entirely with the councils of philosophers, and this he himself found to be true in the person\nof Dionysius. . . . If I should talk philosophy to men that had taken their bias to wealth and greatness, how\ndeaf would they be to all I could say?\"\n\"No doubt, very deaf,\" answered I; \"and no wonder, for one is never to offer at propositions or\nadvice that we are certain will not be entertained. Discourses well out of the listener=s road cannot avail\nanything, or have any effect on men whose minds were prepossessed with different sentiments. A\nphilosophical way of speculation is not unpleasant among friends in a free conversation, but there is no\nroom for it in the courts of princes where great affairs are carried on by authority.\"\n\"That is what I was saying,\" replied he, \"that there is no room for philosophy in the courts of\nprinces.\"\n\"Yes, there is,\" said I, \"but not for speculative philosophy that makes everything to be alike fitting\nat all times: but there is another philosophy that is more pliable, that knows its proper scene,\naccommodates itself to it, and teaches a man with propriety and decency to act that part which has fallen\nto his share. If when one of Plautus's comedies is upon the stage and a company of servants are acting\ntheir parts, you should come out in the garb of a philosopher, and repeat out of 'Octavia,' a discourse of\nSeneca's to Nero, would it not be better for you to say nothing than by mixing things of such different\nnatures to make an impertinent tragi-comedy? For you spoil and corrupt the play that is in hand when you\nmix with it things of an opposite nature, even though they are much better. Therefore go through with the\nplay that is acting, the best you can, and do not confound it because another that is pleasanter comes into\nyour thoughts. It is even so in a commonwealth and in the councils of princes; if ill opinions cannot be\nquite rooted out, and you cannot cure some received vice according to your wishes, you must not\ntherefore abandon the commonwealth; for the same reasons you should not forsake the ship in a storm\nbecause you cannot command the winds. You are not obliged to assault people with discourses that are\nout of their road, when you see that their received notions must prevent your making an impression upon\n\nthem. You ought rather to cast about and to manage things with all the dexterity in your power, so that if\nyou are not able to make them go well they may go as little ill as possible; for except all men were good\neverything cannot be right, and that is a blessing that I do not at present hope to see.\"\n\"According to your arguments,\" answered he, \"all that I could be able to do would be to preserve\nmyself from being mad while I endeavored to cure the madness of others. For if I speak truth, I would\nhave to talk straightforwardly and not in the manner that you advise; and as for lying, whether a\nphilosopher can do it or not, I cannot tell; I am sure I cannot do it. What=s more, although plain speaking\nmay annoy them, I do not see why it should seem so out of the road or an assault upon them. It is not as\nif I should propose such things as Plato has contrived in his commonwealth, or as the Utopians practice in\ntheirs, which are certainly better than our way of doing things but are so different because they are not\nfounded on property, there being no such thing among them.\n. . . And this is all the success that I can have in at Court, for either I must always differ from the\nrest and signify nothing; or I must agree with them and only encourage their madness. I do not\ncomprehend what you mean by your casting about, or by the bending and handling things so dexterously\nthat if they go not well they may do as little harm as possible; for those at Court will not bear a man's\nholding his peace or merely conniving at what others do. No, he must barefacedly approve of the worst\ncounsels and explicitly consent to the blackest designs: he will pass for a spy, or possibly for a traitor, if\nhe did nothing but keep cold silence about wicked practices: and therefore when a man is engaged in such\na society, he will be so far from being able to mend matters by his casting about, as you call it, that he will\nfind no occasions of doing any good: the bad company will sooner corrupt him than be the better for him:\nor if withstanding all, he remains steady and innocent, yet their follies and knavery will be imputed to\nhim; and by mixing counsels with them, he must bear his share of all the blame that belongs wholly to\nothers.\n\"It was no ill simile by which Plato set forth the unreasonableness of a philosopher's meddling\nwith government. If a man, says he, was to see a great company run out every day into the rain, and take\ndelight in being wet; if he knew that it would be to no purpose for him to go and persuade them to return\nto their houses, in order to avoid the storm, and that all that could be expected by his going to speak to\nthem would be that he himself should be as wet as they, it would be best for him to keep within doors;\nand since he had not influence enough to correct other people=s folly, to take care to preserve himself.\nAThough to speak plainly my real sentiments, I must freely own that as long as there is any\nproperty and all things are valued in terms of money, I cannot think that a nation can be governed either\njustly or happily: not justly, because the best things will fall to the share of the worst men; nor happily,\nbecause all things will be divided among a few (and even these are not in all respects happy), the rest\nbeing left to absolute misery. Therefore when I reflect on the wise and good constitution of the Utopians,\namong whom I journeyed and with whom all things are so well governed, and with so few laws; where\nvirtue has its due reward, and yet there is such an equality that every man lives in plentyCwhen I compare\nwith them so many other nations that are always making new laws, and yet can never bring their\nconstitution to a right regulation, where although everyone supposedly has his property; yet all the laws\nthat they invent cannot ensure that anyone gets what is rightly his or preserves it, or even can distinguish\nhis own from another=s; on which point many lawsuits every day break out and are eternally dragging\nonCwhen, I say, I balance all these things in my thoughts, I grow more favorable to Plato, and I wonder\nless that he resolved not to make any laws for such as would not submit to a community of all things: for\nso wise a man could not but foresee that the setting all upon one level was the only way to make a nation\nhappy, which cannot be obtained so long as there is property. For when every man can draw to himself\nall that he can compass, by one title or another, it must needs follow, that how plentiful soever a nation\nmay be at the outset, yet it ends with a few dividing the wealth of it among themselves, and the rest must\nfall into poverty.\n\nASo that there will be two sorts of people among them, who deserve that their fortunes should be\ninterchanged; the former useless, but wicked and ravenous; and the latter, who by their constant industry\nserve the public more than themselves, sincere and modest men. From whence I am persuaded, that till\nproperty is taken away there can be no equitable or just distribution of things, nor can the world be\nhappily governed: for as long as that is maintained, the greatest and the far best part of mankind will be\nstill oppressed with a load of cares and anxieties. I confess without taking it quite away, those pressures\nthat lie on a great part of mankind may be made lighter; but they can never be quite removed. You might\nmake laws to limit how much land and money every man can hand and limit the prince that he might not\ngrow too great, and restrain the people that they might not become too insolent, and make it illegal to buy\npublic offices, which ought neither to be sold, nor made burdensome by a great expense; since otherwise\nthose that serve in them would be tempted to reimburse themselves by cheats and violence, and it would\nbecome necessary to find out rich men for undergoing those employments which ought rather to be\ntrusted to the wise. Such laws, I say, might have such effects, as good diet and care might have on a sick\nman, whose recovery is desperate: they might allay and mitigate the disease, but it could never be quite\nhealed, nor the body politic be brought again to a good habit, as long as property remains; and it will fall\nout as in a complication of diseases, that by applying a remedy to one sore, you will provoke another; and\nthat which removes the one ill symptom produces others, while the strengthening one part of the body\nweakens the rest.@\nAOn the contrary,@ answered I, Ait seems to me that men cannot live prosperously where all\nthings are held in common: how can there be any plenty, where every man will shirk his labor? For where\nthe hope of gain is not an incentive, so the hope of being fed by the labor of others will make him lazy: if\npeople come to be pinched with want, and yet cannot dispose of anything as their own, what can follow\nupon this but perpetual sedition and bloodshed, especially when the reverence and authority due to public\nofficials fall to the ground? For I cannot imagine how respect for authority can be kept up among those\nthat are in all things equal to one another.@\nAI do not wonder,@ said he, Athat it appears so to you, since you have no notion, or at least no\nright one, of such a constitution: but if you had been in Utopia with me, and had seen their laws and rules,\nas I did, for the space of five years, in which I lived among them; and during which time I was so\ndelighted with them, that indeed I should never have left them, if it had not been to tell Europeans about\nthem; you would then confess that you had never seen a people so well constituted as they.@\nAYou will not easily persuade me,@ said Peter, Athat any nation in that new world is better\ngoverned than those among us. For as our understandings are not worse than theirs, so our government, if\nI mistake not, being more ancient, a long practice has helped us to find out many ways for making life\nmore comfortable: and some happy chances have discovered other things to us, which no man=s\nunderstanding could ever have invented.@\nAAs for the antiquity, either of their government or of ours,@ said he, Ayou cannot pass a true\njudgment of it unless you had read their histories; for if they are to be believed, they had towns among\nthem before these parts were so much as inhabited. And as for those discoveries, that have been either hit\non by chance, or made by ingenious men, these might have happened there as well as here. I do not deny\nthat we are more inventive than they are, but they exceed us in industry and application. They knew little\nconcerning us before our arrival among them; they call all Europeans by the general name of\nTransequitorials; for their chronicle mentions a shipwreck that was made on their coast 1,200 years ago;\nand that some Romans and Egyptians that were in the ship, getting safe ashore, spent the rest of their days\namong them; and such was their ingenuity, that from this single opportunity they drew the advantage of\nlearning from those unlooked-for guests, and acquired all the useful arts that were then among the\nRomans, and which were known to these shipwrecked men: and by the hints that they gave them, they\n\nthemselves found out even some of those arts which they could not fully explain; so happily did they\nimprove that accident, of having some of our people cast upon their shore.\nABut if such an accident has at any time brought any from thence into Europe, we have been so\nfar from improving it, that we do not so much as remember it; as in after-times perhaps it will be forgot\nby our people that I was ever there. For though they from one such accident made themselves masters of\nall the good inventions that were among us; yet I believe it would be long before we should learn or put in\npractice any of the good institutions that are among them. And this is the true cause of their being better\ngoverned, and living happier than we, though we come not short of them in point of understanding or\nmanual skill.@\nUpon this I said to him: AI earnestly beg you would describe that island very particularly to us.\nBe not too short, but set out in order all things relating to their soil, their rivers, their towns, their people,\ntheir manners, constitution, laws, and, in a word, all that you imagine we desire to know. And you may\nwell imagine that we desire to know everything concerning them, of which we are hitherto ignorant.@\nAI will do it very willingly,@ said he, Afor I have digested the whole matter carefully; but it will\ntake up some time.@\nALet us go then,@ said I, Afirst and dine, and then we shall have leisure enough.@\nHe consented. We went in and dined, and after dinner came back and sat down in the same place.\nI ordered my servants to take care that none might come and interrupt us. And both Peter and I desired\nRaphael to be as good as his word. When he saw that we were very intent upon it, he paused a little to\nrecollect himself, and began in this manner:\nBOOK II\nTHE island of Utopia is in the middle 200 miles broad, and holds almost at the same width over a\ngreat part of it; but it grows narrower toward both ends. Its figure is not unlike a crescent: between its\nhorns, the sea comes in eleven miles across and spreads itself into a great bay about 500 miles in\ncircumference and is well secured from winds. In this bay there is no great current; the whole coast is one\ncontinued harbor, which gives all that live in the island great convenience for mutual commerce; but the\nentry into the bay, occasioned by rocks on the one hand, and shallows on the other, is very dangerous. In\nthe middle of it there is one single rock which appears above water, and may therefore be easily avoided,\nand on the top of it there is a tower in which a garrison is kept; the other rocks lie under water, and are\nvery dangerous. The channel is known only to the Utopians, so that if any stranger should enter into the\nbay, without one of their pilots, he would run great danger of shipwreck; for even they themselves could\nnot pass it safe, if some marks that are on the coast did not direct their way; and if these should be but a\nlittle shifted, any fleet that might come against them, how great soever it were, would be certainly lost.\nOn the other side of the island there are likewise many harbors; and the coast is so fortified, both\nby nature and art, that a small number of men can hinder the descent of a great army. But they say (and\nthere remain good marks of it to make the story credible) that this was no island at first, but a part of the\ncontinent. It was first conquered by someone called Utopos (whose name it still carries, for Nopants was\nits first name), who brought the rude and uncivilized inhabitants into such a good government, and to that\nmeasure of civilization that they now far excel all the rest of mankind. Having soon subdued them,\nUtopos designed to separate them from the continent and to bring the sea quite round them. To\naccomplish this, he ordered a deep channel to be dug fifteen miles long; and that the natives might not\nthink he treated them like slaves, he not only forced the inhabitants, but also his own soldiers, to labor in\n\ncarrying it on. As he set a vast number of men to work, he beyond all men=s expectations brought it to a\nspeedy conclusion. And his neighbors who at first laughed at the folly of the undertaking, no sooner saw\nit brought to perfection than they were struck with admiration and terror.\nThere are fifty-four large towns on the island, all well built, with the same manners, customs, and\nlaws, and they are all contrived as near in the same manner as the ground on which they stand will allow.\nThe nearest lie at least twenty-four miles distance from one another, and the most remote are not so far\ndistant but that a man can go on foot in one day from it to that which lies next it. Every city sends three of\nits wisest elder citizens once a year to Dreamville, to consult about their common concerns; for that is the\nchief town of the island, being situated near the center of it, so that it is the most convenient place for\ntheir assemblies. The jurisdiction of every town extends at least twenty miles: and where the towns lie\nwider, they have much more ground: no town desires to enlarge its bounds, for the people consider\nthemselves rather as tenants than landlords. They have built over all the country, well-constructed\nfarmhouses furnished with all things necessary for farming. Inhabitants are sent by turns from the towns\nto dwell in them; no country family has fewer than forty men and women in it, besides two slaves. There\nis a master and a mistress set over every family; and over thirty families there is a public official, called\nthe Trybchief.\nEvery year twenty of this family come back to the town, after they have stayed two years in the\ncountry; and in their room there are other twenty sent from the town, that they may learn country work\nfrom those that have been already one year in the country, as they must teach those that come to them the\nnext from the town. By this means such as dwell in those country farms are never ignorant of agriculture,\nand so commit no errors, which might otherwise be fatal, and bring them under a scarcity of grain. But\nthough there is every year such a shifting of the farmers, to prevent any man being forced against his will\nto follow that hard course of life too long, yet many among them take such pleasure in it that they desire\nleave to continue in it many years. These farmers till the ground, breed cattle, hew wood, and convey it to\nthe towns, either by land or water, as is most convenient. They breed an infinite multitude of chickens in a\nvery curious manner; for the hens do not sit and hatch them, but vast numbers of eggs are laid in a gentle\nand equal heat, in order to be hatched, and they are no sooner out of the shell, and able to stir about, but\nthey seem to consider those that feed them as their mothers, and follow them as other chickens do the hen\nthat hatched them.\nThey breed very few horses, but those they have are full of mettle, and are kept only for\nexercising their youth in the art of sitting and riding them; for they do not put them to any work, either of\nploughing or hauling, in which they employ oxen; for though their horses are stronger, yet they find oxen\ncan hold out longer; and as they are not subject to so many diseases, so they are kept upon a less charge,\nand with less trouble; and even when they are so worn out, that they are no more fit for labor, they are\ngood meat at last. They sow no grain, but that which is to be their bread; for they drink either wine, cider,\nor perry, and often water, sometimes boiled with honey or licorice, with which they abound; and though\nthey know exactly how much grain will serve every town, and all that tract of country which belongs to it,\nyet they sow much more, and breed more cattle than are necessary for their consumption; and they give\nthat overplus of which they make no use to their neighbors. When they want anything in the country\nwhich it does not produce, they fetch that from their home town, without carrying anything in exchange\nfor it. And the public officials of the town take care to see it given them; for they meet generally in the\ntown once a month, upon a festival day. When the time of harvest comes, the Trybchiefs in the country\nsend to those in the towns, and let them know how many hands they will need for reaping the harvest; and\nthe number they call for being sent to them, they commonly get all the work done in one day.\nIf you see one of their towns, you=ve seen them all, for they are so like one another, except where\nthe lie of the land makes some difference. I shall therefore describe one of them; and none is so proper as\nDreamville; for as none is more eminent, all the rest yielding in precedence to it, because it is the seat of\n\ntheir Parliament, so there was none of them better known to me, I having lived in it five years altogether.\nIt lies upon the side of a hill, or rather a rising ground: its figure is almost square, for from the one\nside of it, which shoots up almost to the top of the hill, it runs down in a descent for two miles to the river\nDriedup; but it is a little broader the other way that runs along by the bank of that river. The Driedup rises\nabout eighty miles above Dreamville, in a small spring at first, but other brooks falling into it, of which\ntwo are more considerable than the rest. As it runs by Dreamville, it is grown half a mile broad; but it still\ngrows larger and larger, till after sixty miles course below it, it is lost in the ocean, between the town and\nthe sea, and for some miles above the town, it ebbs and flows every six hours, with a strong current. The\ntide comes up for about thirty miles so full that there is nothing but salt water in the river, the fresh water\nbeing driven back with its force; and above that, for some miles, the water is brackish; but a little higher,\nas it runs by the town, it is quite fresh; and when the tide ebbs, it continues fresh all along to the sea.\nThere is a bridge cast over the river, not of timber, but of fair stone, consisting of many stately arches; it\nlies at that part of the town which is farthest from the sea, so that ships without any hindrance lie all along\nthe side of the town.\nThere is likewise another river that runs by it, which, though it is not great, yet it runs pleasantly,\nfor it rises out of the same hill on which the town stands, and so runs down through it, and falls into the\nDriedup. The inhabitants have fortified the fountain-head of this river, which springs a little without the\ntown; so that if they should happen to be besieged, the enemy might not be able to stop or divert the\ncourse of the water, nor poison it; from thence it is carried in earthen pipes to the lower streets; and for\nthose places of the town to which the water of that shall river cannot be conveyed, they have great cisterns\nfor receiving the rain-water, which supplies the want of the other. The town is compassed with a high and\nthick wall, in which there are many towers and forts; there is also a broad and deep dry ditch, set thick\nwith thorns, cast round three sides of the town, and the river is instead of a ditch on the fourth side. The\nstreets are very convenient for all carriage, and are well sheltered from the winds. Their buildings are\ngood, and are so uniform that a whole side of a street looks like one house. The streets are twenty feet\nbroad; there lie gardens behind all their houses; these are large but enclosed with buildings that on all\nhands face the streets; so that every house has both a door to the street, and a back door to the garden.\nTheir doors have all two leaves, which, as they are easily opened, so they shut of their own accord; and\nthere being no property among them, every man may freely enter into any house whatsoever. At every ten\nyears= end they shift their houses by lots.\nThey cultivate their gardens with great care, so that they have vines, fruits, herbs, and flowers in\nthem; and all is so well ordered, and so finely kept, that I never saw gardens anywhere that were both so\nfruitful and so beautiful as theirs. And this humor of ordering their gardens so well is not only kept up by\nthe pleasure they find in it, but also by an emulation between the inhabitants of the several streets, who\nvie with each other; and there is indeed nothing belonging to the whole town that is both more useful and\nmore pleasant. So that he who founded the town seems to have taken care of nothing more than of their\ngardens; for they say, the whole scheme of the town was designed at first by Utopos, but he left all that\nbelonged to the ornament and improvement of it to be added by those that should come after him, that\nbeing too much for one man to bring to perfection. Their records, that contain the history of their town\nand State, are preserved with an exact care, and run backward 1,760 years. From these it appears that their\nhouses were at first low and mean, like cottages, made of any sort of timber, and were built with mud\nwalls and thatched with straw. But now their houses are three stories high: the fronts of them are faced\nwith stone, plastering, or brick; and between the facings of their walls they throw in their rubbish. Their\nroofs are flat, and on them they lay a sort of plaster, which costs very little, and yet is so tempered that it\nis not apt to take fire, and yet resists the weather more than lead. They have great quantities of glass\namong them, with which they glaze their windows. They use also in their windows a thin linen cloth, that\nis so oiled or gummed that it both keeps out the wind and gives free admission to the light.\n\nAs for their system of local government, thirty families elect every year a public official, who was\nanciently called the Styhog, but is now called the Trybchief; and over every ten Styhogs, with the families\nsubject to them, there is another public official, who was anciently called the Greathog, but now the\nSenior Trybchief. All these Styhogs, who number two hundred, choose the Mayor out of a list of four,\nwho are named by the people of the four divisions of the town; but they take an oath before they proceed\nto an election, that they will choose him whom they think most fit for the office. They give their votes\nsecretly, so that it is not known for whom anyone gives his suffrage. The Mayor is for life, unless he is\nremoved upon suspicion of some design to enslave the people. The Trybchiefs are new-chosen every\nyear, but are usually re-elected. All their other public officials are only annual. The Trybchiefs meet every\nthird day, and oftener if necessary, and consult with the Mayor, either concerning the affairs of the State\nin general or such private differences as may arise sometimes among the people; though that seldom\nhappens. There are always two Styhogs called into the council-chamber, and these are changed every day.\nIt is a fundamental rule of their government that no conclusion can be made in anything that relates to the\npublic till it has been first debated for three days in their Council. It is a capital crime for any to meet and\ndiscuss public business, unless it be either in their ordinary Council, or in the Council of the whole island.\nThese things have been so provided among them, that the Mayor and the Trybchiefs may not\nconspire together to change the government and enslave the people; and therefore when anything of great\nimportance is set on foot, it is sent to the Styhogs; who after they have communicated it to the families\nthat belong to their divisions, and have considered it among themselves, make report to the Senate; and\nupon great occasions, the matter is referred to the Council of the whole island. One rule observed in their\nCouncil, is, never to debate a thing on the same day in which it is first proposed; for that is always\nreferred to the next meeting, that so men may not rashly, and in the heat of discourse, engage themselves\ntoo soon, which might bias them so much, that instead of consulting the good of the public, they might\nrather study to support their first opinions, and by a perverse and preposterous sort of shame, hazard their\ncountry rather than endanger their own reputation, or venture the being suspected to have wanted\nforesight in the expedients that they at first proposed. And therefore to prevent this, they take care that\nthey may rather be deliberate than sudden in their motions.\nFarming is so universally understood among them that no person, either man or woman, is\nignorant of it; they are instructed in it from their childhood, partly by what they learn at school and partly\nby practice; they being led out often into the fields, about the town, where they not only see others at\nwork, but are likewise exercised in it themselves. Besides farming, which is so common to them all, every\nman has some peculiar trade to which he applies himself, such as the manufacture of wool, or flax,\nmasonry, smith=s work, or carpenter=s work; for there is no sort of trade that is not in great esteem\namong them. Throughout the island they wear the same sort of clothes without any other distinction,\nexcept what is necessary to distinguish the two sexes, and the married and unmarried. The fashion never\nalters; and as it is neither disagreeable nor uneasy, so it is suited to the climate, and calculated both for\ntheir summers and winters. Every family makes their own clothes; but all among them, women as well as\nmen, learn one or other of the trades formerly mentioned. Women, for the most part, deal in wool and\nflax, which suit best with their weakness, leaving the ruder trades to the men. The same trade generally\npasses down from father to son, inclinations often following descent; but if any man=s genius lies another\nway, he is by adoption translated into a family that deals in the trade to which he is inclined: and when\nthat is to be done, care is taken not only by his father but by the local authorities that he may be put to a\ndiscreet and good family. And if after a person has learned one trade, he desires to acquire another, that is\nalso allowed, and is managed in the same manner as the former. When he has learned both, he follows\nthat which he likes best, unless the public has more occasion for the other.\nThe chief, and almost the only business of the Styhogs, is to take care that nobody sits around\ndoing nothing but that every one gets on with his (or her) job: yet they do not wear themselves out with\nperpetual toil, from morning to night, as if they were beasts of burden, which, as it is indeed a heavy\n\nslavery, so it is everywhere the common course of life among all the working classes except the Utopians;\nbut they dividing the day and night into twenty-four hours, appoint six of these for work; three of which\nare before dinner, and three after. They then sup, and at eight o=clock, counting from noon, go to bed and\nsleep eight hours. The rest of their time besides that taken up in work, eating and sleeping, is left to\neveryone=s discretion; yet they are not to abuse that interval to luxury and idleness, but must employ it in\nsome proper exercise according to their various inclinations, which is for the most part reading. It is\nordinary to have public lectures every morning before daybreak; at which none are obliged to appear but\nthose who are marked out for academic training; yet a great many, both men and women of all ranks, go\nto hear lectures of one sort of other, according to their inclinations. But if others, that are not made for\ncontemplation, choose rather to employ themselves at that time in their trades, as many of them do, they\nare not hindered, but are rather commended, as people who take care to serve their country. After supper,\nthey spend an hour in some diversion, in summer in their gardens, and in winter in the halls where they\neat; where they entertain each other, either with music or discourse. They do not so much as know dice, or\nany such foolish and mischievous games: they have, however, two sorts of games not unlike our chess;\nthe one is between several numbers, in which one number, as it were, Atakes@ another: the other\nresembles a battle between the virtues and the vices, in which the enmity in the vices among themselves,\nand their agreement against the virtues, is not unpleasantly represented; together with the special\noppositions between the particular virtues and vices; as also the methods by which vice either openly\nassaults or secretly undermines virtue, and virtue resists it.\nBut I must say more about the time appointed for labor; otherwise, you may imagine that since\nthere are only six hours appointed for work, they may fall under a scarcity of necessary provisions. But\nthis time is not only sufficient but more than enough for supplying them with plenty of all things, either to\nsustain life or to make it pleasant; and this you will easily apprehend, if you consider how great a part of\nall other nations do no work at all. First, women generally do little, who are the half of mankind; and if\nsome few women are diligent, their husbands are idle: then consider the great company of idle priests, and\nof those that are called religious men; add to these all rich men, chiefly those that have estates in land,\nwho are called noblemen and gentlemen, together with their families, made up of idle persons, that are\nkept more for show than use; add to these, all those strong and lusty beggars, that go about pretending\nsome disease, in excuse for their begging; and upon the whole account you will find that the number of\nthose by whose labors mankind is supplied, is much less than you perhaps imagined. Then consider how\nfew of those that work are employed in labors that are of real service; for we who measure all things by\nmoney, give rise to many trades that are both vain and superfluous, and serve only to support foolish\nentertainment and luxury. For if those who work were employed only in such things as the real\nconveniences of life require, there would be such an abundance of them that the prices of them would\nsink so low that tradesmen could not be maintained by their gains; if all those who labor about useless\nthings were set to more profitable employments, and if all they that languish out their lives in sloth and\nidleness, every one of whom consumes as much as any two of the men that are at work, were made to\nlabor, you may easily imagine that a small proportion of time would serve to supply all the necessities and\ncomforts of lifeBto which you might add all the real and natural forms of pleasure.\nThe existence of Utopia speaks for the truth of all this. For there, in a great town, and in all the\nterritory that lies round it, you can scarce find 500, either men or women, by their age and strength, are\ncapable of labor, that are not engaged in it; even the Styhogs, though excused by the law, yet do not\nexcuse themselves, but work, that by their examples they may excite the industry of the rest of the people.\nThe like exemption is allowed to those who, being recommended to the people by the priests, are by the\nsecret ballot of the Styhogs exempt from physical labor, that they may apply themselves wholly to study;\nand if any of these fall short of those hopes that they seemed at first to give, they are obliged to return to\nwork. And sometimes a manual laborer that so employs his leisure hours as to make a considerable\nadvancement in learning, is eased from practicing a trade and ranked among their academics. Out of these\nthey choose their ambassadors, their priests, their Greathogs, and the Mayor himself, anciently called a\n\nGodson, but now called an Overnone.\nAnd thus from the great numbers among them that are neither suffered to be idle, nor to be\nemployed in any fruitless labor, you may easily make the estimate how much may be done in those few\nhours in which they are obliged to labor. But besides all that has been already said, it is to be considered\nthat the needful arts among them are managed with less labor than anywhere else. The building or the\nrepairing of houses among us employ many hands, because often a thriftless heir suffers a house that his\nfather built to fall into decay, so that his successor must, at a great cost, repair that which he might have\nkept up with a small charge: it frequently happens that the same house which one person built at a vast\nexpense is neglected by another, who thinks he has a more delicate sense of the beauties of architecture;\nand he suffering it to fall to ruin, builds another at no less charge. But among the Utopians all things are\nso regulated that men very seldom build upon a new piece of ground; and are not only very quick in\nrepairing their houses, but show their foresight in preventing their decay: so that their buildings are\npreserved very long, with but little labor, and thus the builders to whom that care belongs are often\nwithout employment, except the hewing of timber and the squaring of stones, that the materials may be in\nreadiness for raising a building very suddenly when there is any occasion for it.\nAs to their clothes, observe how little work is spent in them: while they are at labor, they are\nclothed with jeans or corduroys, which will last seven years; and when they appear in public they put on\ncasual jackets and slacks, all of the natural color of the wool. As they need less woollen cloth than is used\nanywhere else, so that which they make use of is much less costly. They use linen cloth more; but that is\nprepared with less labor, and they value cloth only by the whiteness of the linen or the cleanness of the\nwool, without much regard to the fineness of the thread: while in other places, four or five upper garments\nof woollen cloth, of different colors, and as many shirts or blouses of silk, will scarce serve one person;\nand while those that are flashy types think ten are too few, everyone in Utopia is content with one, which\nvery often serves for two years. Nor is there any temptation to desire more; for no one who had them\nwould be the warmer nor make one jot the better appearance for it. And thus, since they are all employed\nin some useful labor, and since they content themselves with fewer things, it falls out that there is a great\nabundance of all things among them: so that it frequently happens that, for want of other work, vast\nnumbers are sent out to mend the highways. But when no public undertaking is to be performed, the hours\nof working are lessened. The public officials never engage the people in unnecessary labor, since the chief\nend of their economic system is to regulate labor by the necessities of the public, and to allow all the\npeople as much time as possible for the improvement of their minds, in which they think the happiness of\nlife consists.\nBut it is now time to explain to you the mutual intercourse of this people, their social\narrangements, and the rules by which all things are distributed among them. As their towns are composed\nof families, so their families are made up of those that are nearly related to one another. Their women,\nwhen they grow up, are married out; but all the males, both children and grandchildren, live still in the\nsame house, in great obedience to their oldest male relative unless age has weakened his understanding:\nand in that case, he that is next to him in age takes over. But lest any town should become either too great\nor too little, provision is made that none of their towns may contain above 6,000 families, besides those of\nthe country round it. No family may have less than ten and more than sixteen grown-ups in it. Obviously,\nthey cannot predict the number of children, but the rule is easily observed by removing some of the\nchildren, once they come of age, to any other family that does not abound so much in members. By the\nsame rule, they supply towns that do not increase so fast, from others that breed faster; and if there is any\nincrease over the whole island, then they draw out a number of their citizens out of the several towns, and\nsend them over to the neighboring continent; where, if they find that the inhabitants have more land than\nthey can well cultivate, they fix a colony, taking the native inhabitants into their society, if they are\nwilling to live with them; and where they do that of their own accord, they quickly enter into the Utopian\nway of life and conform to its rules, and this proves a happiness to both nations; for according to their\n\nconstitution, such care is taken of the land that it becomes fruitful enough for both, though it might be\notherwise too narrow and barren for any one of them.\nBut if the natives refuse to conform themselves to their laws, they drive them out of those bounds\nwhich they mark out for themselves, and use force if they resist. For they account it a very just cause of\nwar for a nation to hinder others from possessing a part of that land of which they make no use, but which\nis suffered to lie idle and uncultivated; since every man has by the law of nature a right to such a waste\nportion of the earth as is necessary for his subsistence. If an accident has so lessened the number of the\ninhabitants of any of their towns that it cannot be made up from the other towns of the island without\ndiminishing them too much (which is said to have fallen out but twice since they were first a people,\nwhen great numbers were carried off by the plague), the loss is then supplied by recalling as many as are\nwanted from their colonies; for they will abandon these, rather than suffer the towns in the island to sink\ntoo low.\nBut to return to their manner of living in society, the oldest man of every family, as has been\nalready said, is its governor. Wives serve their husbands, and children their parents, and always the\nyounger serves the elder. Every town is divided into four equal parts, and in the middle of each there is a\nwarehouse: what is produced by the several families is carried from thence to comprehensive shopping\ncenters, in which all things of the same kind are laid out together; and thither every father goes and takes\nwhatsoever he or his family needs, without either paying for it or leaving anything in exchange. There is\nno reason for giving a denial to any person, since there is such plenty of everything among them; and\nthere is no danger of a man=s asking for more than he needs, since everyone is sure that they shall always\nbe supplied. It is the fear of want that makes any of the whole race of animals either greedy or ravenous;\nbut besides fear, there is in man a pride that makes him fancy it a particular glory to excel others in pomp\nand excess. But by the laws of the Utopians, there is no room for this. Near the shopping centers there are\nmarkets for all sorts of provisions that come from the farming countryside, where there are not only herbs,\nfruits, and bread, but also fish, fowl, and cattle. Outside their towns, there are places appointed near some\nrunning water, for killing their beasts, and for washing away their filth, which is done by their slaves: for\nthey suffer none of their citizens to kill their cattle, because they think that pity and good-nature, which\nare among the best of those affections that are born with us, are much impaired by the butchering of\nanimals: nor do they suffer anything that is foul or unclean to be brought within their towns, lest the air\nshould be polluted which might prejudice their health.\nIn every street there are large buildings that lie at an equal distance from each other, distinguished\nby particular names. These are the homes of the Styhogs, who, as I said, have jurisdiction over thirty\nfamilies; fifteen of these live one side of the Styhog=s house, and fifteen on the other, and there they\nmeet and eat all their meals. The caterers for the dining-hall of every one of them come to the\nmarket-place at an appointed hour; and carry home provisions according to the number of those that\nbelong to the hall. But the sick have special priority: these are lodged and provided for in the four public\nhospitals that belong tto every town four hospitals. The hospitals are built just outside the city-walls and\nare so large that they may pass for little towns: by this means, if they had ever such a number of sick\npersons, they could lodge them conveniently, and at such a distance, that such of them as are sick of\ninfectious diseases may be kept so far from the rest that there can be no danger of contagion. The\nhospitals are furnished and stored with all things needful for the ease and recovery of the sick; and those\nthat are put in them are looked after with such tender and watchful care, and are so constantly attended by\nskillful physicians, that although none are forced to go there, nearly everyone falling ill would choose\nrather to go there than lie sick at home.\nAfter the steward of the hospitals has taken for the sick whatsoever the physician prescribes, then\nthe best things that are left in the market are distributed equally among the halls, in proportion to their\nnumbers, only, in the first place, they serve the Mayor, the Bishop, the Trybchiefs, visiting diplomats, and\n\nforeigners, if there are any, which indeed falls out but seldom, and for whom there are houses well\nfurnished, particularly appointed for their reception when they come among them. At the hours of dinner\nand supper, the whole Sty being called together by sound of trumpet, they meet and eat together, except\nonly such as are in the hospitals or lie sick at home. Yet after the halls are served, no man is hindered to\ncarry provisions home from the market-place; for they know that none does that but for some good\nreason; for though any that will may eat at home, yet none does it willingly, since it is both ridiculous and\nfoolish for any to give themselves the trouble to make ready an ill dinner at home, when there is a much\nmore plentiful one made ready for him so near at hand. All the rough and dirty work about these halls is\ndone by slaves; but the preparation and cooking is left entirely to the women, all those of every family\ntaking it by turns. The other grown-ups sit at three or more tables, according to their number; the men sit\ntoward the wall, and the women sit on the other side, that if any of them should be taken suddenly ill,\nwhich is no uncommon case among women with child, she may, without disturbing the rest, rise and go to\nthe nursery, to join those breast-feeding children, where there is always clean water at hand, and cradles\nin which they may lay infants, if there is occasion for it, and a fire that they may shift and dress them\nbefore it.\nEvery child is nursed by its own mother, if death or sickness does not intervene; and in that case\nthe Styhogs= wives find a wet-nurse quickly, which is no hard matter; for anyone that can do it offers\nherself cheerfully; for as they are much inclined to that piece of mercy, so the child whom the nurse\nconsiders the nurse as its mother. All the children under five years old eat in the nursery; the rest of the\nyounger sort of both sexes, till they are fit for marriage, either serve those in the main dining-hall or, if\nthey are not strong enough for that, stand by them in great silence, and eat what is given them; nor have\nthey any other formality of dining. In the middle of the first table, which stands across the upper end of\nthe hall, sit the Styhog and his wife; for that is the chief and most conspicuous place: next to him sit the\ntwo oldest diners, for there always din four to a table. If there is a chapel in the Sty, the vicar and his wife\nsit with the Styhog above all the rest: next them there is a mixture of old and young, who are so placed,\nthat as the young are set near others, so they are mixed with the more elderly; which they say was\nappointed on this account, that the gravity of the old people, and the reverence that is due to them, might\nrestrain the younger from all indecent words and gestures. Dishes are not served up to the whole table at\nfirst, but the best are first set before the old, whose seats are distinguished from the young, and after them\nall the rest are served alike. The old men share with the younger any really tasty bits that happen to be set\nbefore them, if there is not such an abundance of them that the whole company may be served alike. Thus\nold men are honored with a particular respect; yet all the rest eat as well as they.\nBoth dinner and supper are begun with some lecture on ethics that is read to them; but it is so\nshort, that it is not tedious nor uneasy to hear it: from hence the old men take occasion to entertain those\nabout them with some useful and pleasant commentary; but they do not engross the whole discourse so to\nthemselves, during their meals, that the younger may not put in for a share: on the contrary, they engage\nthem to talk, that so they may in that free way of conversation find out the force of everyone=s spirit and\nobserve his temper. They eat breakfast quickly but sit long at supper; because they go to work after the\none, and are to sleep after the other, during which they think the stomach carries on the concoction more\nvigorously. They never sup without music; and there is always fruit served up after meat; while they are\nat table, some burn perfumes and sprinkle about fragrant ointments and sweet waters: in short, they want\nnothing that may cheer up their spirits: they give themselves a large allowance that way, and indulge\nthemselves in all such pleasures as are attended with no inconvenience. That=s how they live in the\ntowns; in the country, where they live at great distance, everyone eats at home, and no family wants any\nnecessary sort of provision, for it is from them that provisions are sent to those that live in the towns.\nIf any man has a mind to visit his friends that live in some other town, or desires to travel and see\nthe rest of the country, he obtains leave very easily from the Styhog and Trybchiefs when there is no\nparticular occasion for him at home: such as travel, carry with them a passport from the Mayor, which\nboth certifies the license that is granted for traveling, and limits the time of their return. They are\n\nfurnished with a wagon, and a slave who drives the oxen and looks after them; but unless there are\nwomen in the company, the wagon is sent back at the end of the journey as a needless encumbrance.\nWhile they are on the road, they carry no provisions with them; yet they want nothing, but are everywhere\ntreated as if they were at home. If they stay in any place longer than a night, they are expected to fit in and\ndo their own sort of work and they will be welcomed by those who do it there; but if any man goes out of\nthe town to which he belongs, without leave, and is found rambling without a passport, he is severely\ntreated. He is punished as a fugitive and sent home disgracefully; and if he falls again into the like fault,\nis condemned to slavery. However, anyone who wants to travel only over the local countryside may freely\ndo it, after getting his father=s permission and his wife=s consent; but when he comes into any of the\ncountry houses, if he expects to be entertained by them, he must work with them and conform to their\nrules: and if he does this, he may freely go over the whole precinct; being thus as useful to the town to\nwhich he belongs, as if he were still within it. Thus you see that there are no idle persons among them, nor\npretense of excuse from labor. There are no taverns, no alehouses nor whore-houses among them; nor any\nother occasions of corrupting each other, of getting into corners, or forming themselves into parties.\nEveryone lives in full view, so that all are obliged, both to perform their ordinary tasks, and to employ\nthemselves well in their spare hours. And it is certain that a people thus ordered must live in great\nabundance of all things; and these being equally distributed among them, no man can want, or be obliged\nto beg.\nIn their great annual Parliament at Dreamville, to which there are three sent from every town once\na year, they examine what towns abound in provisions and what are under any scarcity, that so the one\nmay be furnished from the other; and this is done freely, without any sort of exchange; for according to\ntheir plenty or scarcity they supply or are supplied from one another; so that indeed the whole island is, as\nit were, one family. When they have thus taken care of their whole country, and laid up stores for two\nyears, which they do to prevent the ill-consequences of an unfavorable season, they order an exportation\nof the surplus, of grain, honey, wool, flax, wood, wax, tallow, leather, and cattle; which they send out\ncommonly in great quantities to other nations. They order a seventh part of all these goods to be freely\ngiven to the poor of the countries to which they send them, and they sell the rest at moderate rates. And\nby this exchange, they not only bring back those few needful things that they do not produce themselves\n(and indeed they scarce need anything but iron) but also a great deal of gold and silver; and by their\ndriving this trade so long, you cannot imagine how vast a treasure they have got among them, so that now\nthey do not much care whether they sell off their merchandise for cash or credit.\nA great part of their treasure is now in credit of this sort; but in all their contracts no private man\nstands bound, but the writing runs in the name of the town to which the debtor belongs; the town collects\nfrom the debtor when they please and can then use the money or enjoy the profit of it till the Utopians call\nfor it; and the Utopians choose rather to let the greatest part of it lie in their hands who make advantage\nby it, than to call for it themselves: but if they see that any of their other neighbors stand more in need of\nit, then they call it in and lend it to them. Whenever they are engaged in war, which is the only occasion\nin which their treasure can be usefully employed, they make use of it themselves, in hiring foreign\nmercenaries, whom they more willingly expose to danger than their own people: they give them great\npay, knowing well that this will work even on their enemies, that it will engage them either to betray their\nown side, or at least to desert it, and that it is the best means of raising mutual jealousies among them.\nFor this end they have an incredible treasure; but they do not keep it as a treasure, but in such a manner as\nI am almost afraid to tell, lest you think it so extravagant, as to be hardly credible. This I have the more\nreason to apprehend, because if I had not seen it myself, I could not have been easily persuaded to have\nbelieved it upon any man=s report.\nIt is certain that all things appear incredible to us, in proportion as they differ from our own\ncustoms. But one who can judge aright will not wonder to find that, since their arrangement of life differs\nso much from ours, their value of gold and silver should be measured by a very different standard; for\n\nsince they have no use for money among themselves, but keep it as a provision against events which\nseldom happen, and between which there are generally long intervals, they value it no farther than it\ndeserves, that is, in proportion to its use, which is, of course far less than the value of iron. For men can\nno more live without iron than without fire or water, but Nature has marked out no use for the other\nmetals so essential that they could not easily be dispensed with. It is the idiocy of mankind to enhance the\nvalue of gold and silver, simply because of their scarcity. Whereas, on the contrary, it is the Utopian\nopinion that Mother Nature, as an indulgent parent, has freely given us all the best things in great\nabundance, such as water and earth, and has buried and hidden way the things that are vain and useless.\nNow, if these metals were laid up in any tower in the kingdom, it would raise a suspicion among\nthe people that the Mayor and the District Councilors were intending to sacrifice the interest of the public\nto their own private advantage. At the same time, if they should work it into vessels or any sort of plate,\nthey fear that the people might grow too fond of it, and so be unwilling to let the plate be run down if a\nwar made it necessary to employ it in paying their soldiers. To prevent all these inconveniences, they\nhave fallen upon an expedient, which, as it agrees with their other policy, so is it very different from ours,\nand will scarce gain belief among us, who value gold so much and lay it up so carefully. They eat and\ndrink out of vessels of earth, or glass, which make an agreeable appearance though formed of brittle\nmaterials: while they make their toilet-seats and urinals of gold and silver; and that not only in their public\nhalls, but in their private houses: of the same metals they likewise make chains and fetters for their slaves;\nto some of which, as a badge of infamy, they hang an ear-ring of gold, and make others wear a chain or\ncoronet of the same metal; and thus they take care, by all possible means, to render gold and silver a thing\nof contempt. And from hence it is that while other nations part with their gold and silver as unwillingly as\nif one tore out their guts, those of Utopia would look upon giving all they possess of those metals (when\nthere was any use for them) but as the donation of a trifle, much as we would esteem the loss of a penny.\nThey find pearls on their coast, and diamonds and carbuncles on their rocks; they do not seek them, but if\nthey find them by chance they polish them, and with them they adorn their children, who are delighted\nwith them, and glory in them during their childhood; but when they grow to years, and see that none but\nchildren use such baubles, they of their own accord, without being bid by their parents, lay them aside;\nand would be as much ashamed to use them afterward as children among us, when they come to years, are\nof their puppets and other toys.\nI never saw a clearer instance of the opposite impressions that different customs make on people,\nthan I observed in the ambassadors from Fartland, who came to Dreamville when I was there. As they\ncame to treat of affairs of great consequence, the deputies from several towns met together to wait for\ntheir coming. The ambassadors of the nations that lie near Utopia, knowing their customs, and that fine\nclothes are in no esteem among them, that silk is despised, and gold is a badge of infamy, used to come\nvery modestly clothed; but the Fartlanders, lying more remote, and having had little commerce with them,\nunderstanding that they were coarsely clothed, and all in the same manner, took it for granted that they\nhad none of those fine things among them of which they made no use; and they being a self-assertive\nrather than a wise people, resolved to set themselves out with so much splendor that they should look like\ngods, and strike the eyes of the poor Utopians with their appearance. Thus three ambassadors made their\nentry with 100 attendants, all clad in garments of different colors, and the greater part in silk; the\nambassadors themselves, who were of the nobility of their country, were in cloth-of-gold, and adorned\nwith massy chains, ear-rings, and rings of gold: their caps were covered with bracelets set full of pearls\nand other gems: in a word, they were set out with all those things that, among the Utopians, were the\nbadges of slavery, the marks of infamy, or the playthings of children.\nIt would have amused you to see, on the one side, how they looked big, when they compared their\nrich habits with the plain clothes of the Utopians, who were come out in great numbers to see them make\ntheir entry: and, on the other, to observe how much they were mistaken in the impression which they\nhoped their display would have made on them. It appeared so ridiculous a show to all that had never\nstirred out of their country and had not seen the customs of other nations that though they paid some\n\nreverence to those that were the most meanly clad, as if they had been the ambassadors, yet when they\nsaw the ambassadors themselves, so full of gold and chains, they looked upon them as slaves, and\nvirtually ignored them. You might have heard the children, who were grown big enough to despise their\nplaythings and who had thrown away their jewels, call to their mothers, push them gently, and cry out,\nASee that great fool that wears pearls and gems, as if he were yet a child.@ While their mothers very\ninnocently replied, AHold your peace; this, I believe, is one of the ambassador=s court jesters.@ Others\ncensured the fashion of their chains, and observed that they were of no use; for they were too slight to\nbind their slaves, who could easily break them; and besides hung so loose about them that they thought it\neasy to throw them away, and so run free of them.\nBut after the ambassadors had stayed a day among them and saw so vast a quantity of gold in\ntheir houses, which was as much despised by them as it was esteemed in other nations, and beheld more\ngold and silver in the chains and fetters of one slave than all their ornaments amounted to, their plumes\nfell, and they were ashamed of all that glory for which they had formerly valued themselves, and they\naccordingly laid it aside; a resolution that they immediately took, when on their engaging in some free\ndiscourse with the Utopians, they discovered their sense of such things and their other customs. The\nUtopians wonder how any man should be so much taken with the glaring doubtful luster of a jewel or a\nstone, that can look up to a star or the sun; or how any should value himself because his cloth is made of a\nfiner thread: for how fine soever that thread may be, it was once no better than the fleece of a sheep, and\nthat sheep was a sheep still while wearing it. They wonder much to hear that gold which in itself is so\nuseless a thing, should be everywhere so much esteemed, that even men for whom it was made, and by\nwhom it has its value, should yet be thought of less value than this metal. That a man whose brains are\nlead, who has no more sense than a log of wood, and is as bad as he is foolish, should have many wise\nand good men to serve him, only because he has a great heap of that metal; and that if it should happen\nthat by some accident or trick of law (which sometimes produces as great changes as chance itself) all this\nwealth should pass from the master to the meanest varlet of his whole family, he himself would very soon\nbecome one of his servants, as if he were a thing that belonged to his wealth, and so were bound to follow\nits fortune. But they much more admire and detest the folly of those who, when they see a rich man,\nthough they neither owe him anything nor are in any sort dependent on his bounty, yet merely because he\nis rich give him little less than divine honors, even though they know him to be so covetous and\nbase-minded that notwithstanding all his wealth he will not part with one penny of it to them as long as he\nlives.\nThese and such like notions has that people imbibed, partly from their education, being bred in a\ncountry whose customs and laws are opposite to all such foolish maxims, and partly from their learning\nand studies; for though there are but few in any town that are so wholly excused from labor as to give\nthemselves entirely up to their studies, these being only such persons as discover from their childhood an\nextraordinary capacity and disposition for letters; yet their children, and a great part of the nation, both\nmen and women, are taught to spend those hours in which they are not obliged to work, in reading: and\nthis they do through the whole progress of life. All their books are written in the Utopian language,\nwhich is both copious and pleasant to the ear, and one in which a man can fully express his mind. It is\nspoken all over that part of the world but it not always with much facility outside Utopia itself. In this\nlanguage, they have accumulated quite a store of knowledge. They had never so much as heard of the\nnames of any of those philosophers that are so famous in these parts of the world, before we went among\nthem; and yet they had made the same discoveries as the Greeks, in music, logic, arithmetic, and\ngeometry. But as they are almost in everything equal to the ancient philosophers, so they rather fall\nbehind our modern logicians; for they have never yet forced their youths to learn those rules and\nsyllogisms of such desperate importance in our logical schools. They are so far from understanding the\nwhole subject of Intension2 that none of them could comprehend what we meant when we talked to them\n2In logic, the range of properties that determine the general class to which something designated\n\nof Man, whose qualities are common to all particular human beings and who must therefore be bigger and\nmore real than any of them. We spoke of this Colossus universal Man as if he were impossible to\noverlook, and yet none of them could see him.\nby a concept belongs. All things sharing an Intension constitute the Extension of the concept.\n\nYet for all this ignorance of these notions, they knew astronomy, and were perfectly acquainted\nwith the motions of the heavenly bodies, and have many instruments, well contrived and divided, by\nwhich they very accurately compute the course and positions of the sun, moon, and stars. But the frauds\nof astrology have not so much as entered into their thoughts. They have a particular sagacity, founded\nupon much observation, in weather-forecasting, but as to the philosophy of these things, the causes of the\nsaltiness of the sea, of its ebbing and flowing, and of the origin and nature both of the heavens and the\nearth; they dispute of them, partly as our ancient philosophers have done, and partly upon some new\nhypothesis, in which, as they differ from them, so they do not in all things agree among themselves.\nAs to moral philosophy, they have the same disputes among them as we have here: they examine\nwhat are properly good both for the body and the mind, and whether any outward thing can be called truly\ngood, or if that term belong only to the endowments of the soul. They inquire likewise into the nature of\nvirtue and pleasure; but their chief dispute is concerning the happiness of a man, wherein it consists and\nwhether in some one thing or in a great many They seem, indeed, inclined to the opinion that places, if\nnot the whole, yet the chief part of a man=s happiness in pleasure; and, what may seem more strange,\nthey make use of arguments even from religion, notwithstanding its severity and roughness, for the\nsupport of that opinion so indulgent to pleasure; for they never dispute concerning happiness without\nfetching some arguments from the principles of religion, as well as from natural reason, since without\nreligion they reckon that reason=s notions of happiness must be but conjectural and defective.\nThese are their religious principles, that the soul of man is immortal, and that God of his\ngoodness has designed that it should be happy; and that he has therefore appointed rewards for good and\nvirtuous actions, and punishments for vice, to be distributed after this life. Though these are religious\nprinciples, they think that even reason itself determines a man to believe and acknowledge them, and\nfreely confess that if these were taken away no man would be so insensible as not to seek after pleasure\nby all possible means, lawful or unlawful; using only this caution, that a lesser pleasure might not stand in\nthe way of a greater, and that no pleasure ought to be pursued that should draw a great deal of pain after\nit; for they think it the maddest thing in the world to pursue virtue, that is often an uncomfortable thing;\nand not only to renounce the pleasures of life, but willingly to undergo much pain and trouble, if a man\nhas no prospect of a reward. And what reward can there be for one that has passed his whole life, not only\nwithout pleasure, but in pain, if there is nothing to expect after death?\nYet they do not place happiness in all sorts of pleasures, but only in those that in themselves are\ngood and honest. There are a few among them who place happiness simply in virtue itself, but most think\nthat virtue conducts creatures like us to happiness and that happiness, considered as a sum of pleasures, is\nthe summum bonum, that is, the highest good of man. They define virtue thus, that it is a living according\nto nature and think that God made us to do so; they believe, therefore, that in pursuing or avoiding things\naccording to reason one is just following one=s natural inclinations. They also say that reason first\nteaches us to love and reverence for the Divine Majesty, to whom we owe both all that we have and all\nthat we can ever hope for. In the next place, reason directs us to keep our minds as free from passion and\nas cheerful as we can, and that we should consider ourselves as bound by the ties of good-nature and\nhumanity to use our utmost endeavors to help forward the happiness of all other persons.\nFor the most sour and severe pursuer of virtue, the greatest enemy to pleasure, although he sets\nhard rules for everyone to undergo much pain, do without sleep, and endure other discomforts, yet he also\nadvises them to do all they can to relieve the pains and miseries of others, and he will praise those\ndisposed to do so. And the Utopians infer that if a man ought to advance the welfare and comfort of the\nrest of mankindCthere being no virtue more proper and peculiar to our nature than to enhance the pleasure\nof others, free them from trouble and anxiety, and furnish them with the comforts of life, in which\npleasure consistsCwhy, then, nature just as vigorously prompts everyone to do this for himself as well.\nEither a life of pleasure is a real evil, in which case we ought not to assist others in their pursuit of it, but\n\non the contrary, to keep them from it all we can, or else it is a good thing, so that we not only may, but\nought to help others to it; and if this is the case, why, then, ought not a man to begin with himself? No\none can be more bound to look after the good of another than after one=s own; for nature cannot direct us\nto be good and kind to others and then turn around and tell us to be unmerciful and cruel to ourselves.\nThus, as the Utopians define virtue to be living according to nature, so they imagine that nature prompts\nall people to seek after pleasure as the end of all they do. However, they also observe that in order to\nsupport the pleasures of life, nature inclines us to enter into society; for there is no man so much raised\nabove the rest of mankind as to be the only favorite of nature who, on the contrary, seems to have placed\non a level all those that belong to the same species. Upon this they infer that no one ought to seek his own\nconveniences at the expense of other people; and therefore they think that everyone should keep one=s\npromises and also obey the laws regulating the distribution of those conveniences of life that afford us all\nour pleasuresCprovided such laws have been published in due form by a wise ruler or consented to by a\npeople neither oppressed with tyranny nor circumvented by fraud.\nThey think it is an evidence of true wisdom for a man to pursue his own advantages as far as the\nlaws allow it. They account it piety to prefer the public good to one=s private concerns; but they think it\nunjust for a man to seek for pleasure by snatching another man=s pleasures from him. And on the\ncontrary, they think it a sign of a gentle and good soul, for a man to dispense with his own advantage for\nthe good of others; and that by this means a good man finds as much pleasure one way as he parts with\nanother; for he may expect the like from others when he may come to need it, and even if that should fail\nhim, yet the sense of a good action, and the reflections that he makes on the love and gratitude of those\nwhom he has so obliged, gives the mind more pleasure than the body could have found in that from which\nit had restrained itself. They are also persuaded that God will make up the loss of those small pleasures,\nwith a vast and endless joy, of which religion easily convinces a good soul. Thus, upon an inquiry into the\nwhole matter, they reckon that all our actions, and even all our virtues, terminate in pleasure, as in our\nchief end and greatest happiness.\nThey call by the name of pleasure every motion or state, either of body or mind in which nature\nteaches us to delight, but they cautiously limit pleasure only to those appetites and delights to which\nreason as well as sense carries usCthose by which we neither injure any other person nor lose the\npossession of greater pleasures nor otherwise draw troubles after them. Accordingly, they look upon\nthose delights which most peoples by an idiotic but common mistake call pleasure as things that greatly\nobstruct their real happiness instead of advancing itBas if their nature could be easily changed just by the\nuse of words. Such things, they hold, so entirely possess the minds of those that are once captivated by\nthem with a false notion of pleasure that there is no room left for pleasures of a truer or purer kind. They\nbecome prisoners of the many things that in themselves have nothing that is truly delightfulBon the\ncontrary, they have a good deal of bitterness in themBand yet from their perverse appetites after forbidden\nobjects are not only ranked among the pleasures but are made even the great designs of life.\nAmong those who pursue these sophisticated pleasures, they reckon such as I mentioned before,\nwho think themselves really the better for having fine clothes; in which they think they are doubly\nmistaken, both in the opinion that they have of their clothes, and in that they have of themselves; for if\nyou consider the use of clothes, why should a fine thread be thought better than a coarse one? And yet\nthese men, as if they had some real advantages beyond others and did not owe them wholly to their\nmistakes, look big, seem to fancy themselves to be more valuable, and imagine that a respect is due to\nthem for the sake of a rich garment to which they would not have pretended if they had been more meanly\nclothed; they even resent it as an affront, if that respect is not paid them. It is just as idiotic to be taken\nwith outward marks of respect, which signify nothing: for what true or real pleasure can one man find in\nanother=s standing bareheaded, or bending the knee to him? Will the bending another man=s knees cure\nyour rheumatism? And will his head=s being bare cure the madness of yours? And yet it is wonderful to\nsee how this imaginary notion of pleasure bewitches many who delight themselves with the fancy of their\n\nnobility, and are pleased with this conceit, that they are descended from ancestors who have been held for\nsome successions rich, and who have had great possessions; for this is all that makes nobility at present;\nyet they do not think themselves a whit the less noble, even when their immediate parents have left none\nof this wealth to them or they themselves have squandered it away.\nThe Utopians have no better opinion of those who are much taken with gems and precious stones,\nand who account it a degree of happiness, next to a divine one, if they can purchase one that is very\nextraordinary; especially if it be of that sort of stones that is then in greatest request; for the same sort is\nnot at all times universally of the same value; nor will men buy it unless it be dismounted and taken out of\nthe gold; the jeweler is then made to give good security, and required solemnly to swear that the stone is\ntrue, that by such an exact caution a false one might not be bought instead of a true: though if you were to\nexamine it, your eye could find no difference between the counterfeit and that which is true; so that they\nare all one to you as much as if you were blind. Or can it be thought that they who heap up a useless mass\nof wealth, not for any use that it is to bring them, but merely to please themselves with the contemplation\nof it, enjoy any true pleasure in it? The delight they find is only a false shadow. Those are no better whose\nerror is somewhat different from the former, and who hide it, out of their fear of losing it; for what other\nname can fit the hiding it in the earth, or rather the restoring it to it again, it being thus cut off from being\nuseful, either to its owner or to the rest of mankind? And yet the owner having hid it carefully, is glad,\nbecause he thinks he is now sure of it. If it should be stolen, the owner, though he might live perhaps ten\nyears after the theft, of which he knew nothing, would find no difference between his having or losing it;\nfor both ways it was equally useless to him.\nAmong those foolish pursuers of pleasure they reckon all that delight in hunting, in fowling, or\ngaming: of whose idiocy they have only heard, for they have no such things among them. But they have\nasked us, what sort of pleasure is it that men can find in throwing the dice? For if there were any pleasure\nin it, they think the doing of it so often should give one a surfeit of it: and what pleasure can one find in\nhearing the barking and howling of dogs, which seem rather odious than pleasant sounds? Nor can they\ncomprehend the pleasure of seeing dogs run after a hare, more than of seeing one dog run after another;\nfor if the seeing them run is that which gives the pleasure, you have the same entertainment to the eye on\nboth these occasions, since that is the same in both cases: but if the pleasure lies in seeing the hare killed\nand torn by the dogs, this ought rather to stir pity, that a weak, harmless and fearful hare should be\ndevoured by strong, fierce, and cruel dogs. Therefore all this business of hunting is, among the Utopians,\nturned over to their butchers; and those, as has been already said, are all slaves; and they look on hunting\nas one of the basest parts of a butcher=s work: for they account it both more profitable and more decent to\nkill those beasts that are more necessary and useful to mankind than the killing and tearing of so small\nand miserable an animal, which can only attract the huntsman with a false show of pleasure and from\nwhich he can reap but small advantage. They look on the desire of the bloodshed, even of beasts, as a\nmark of a mind that is already corrupted with cruelty, or that at least by the frequent returns of so brutal a\npleasure must degenerate into it.\nThus, though the rabble of mankind look upon these, and on innumerable other things of the same\nnature, as pleasures, the Utopians, on the contrary, observing that there is nothing in them truly pleasant,\nconclude that they are not to be reckoned among pleasures: for though these things may create some\ntickling in the senses (which seems to be a true notion of pleasure), yet they imagine that this does not\narise from the thing itself, but from a depraved custom, which may so vitiate a man=s taste, that bitter\nthings may pass for sweet; as women with child think pitch or tallow tastes sweeter than honey; but as\nanyone=s sense when corrupted, either by a disease or some ill habit, does not change the nature of other\nthings, so neither can it change the nature of pleasure.\nThey reckon up several sorts of pleasures, which they call true ones: some belong to the body and\nothers to the mind. The pleasures of the mind lie in knowledge, and in that delight which the\n\ncontemplation of truth carries with it; to which they add the joyful reflections on a well-spent life, and the\nassured hopes of a future happiness. They divide the pleasures of the body into two sorts; the one is that\nwhich gives our senses some real delight, and is performed, either by supplying those parts which feed the\ninternal heat of life by eating and drinking; or when nature is eased of any excess that oppresses it; as in\nexcreting or scratching or satisfying the appetite which nature has wisely given to lead us to the\npropagation of the species. There is also a pleasure that arises neither from our receiving what the body\nrequires nor its being relieved when overcharged, and yet by a secret, unseen virtue affects the senses,\nraises the passions, and strikes the mind with generous impressions; this is the pleasure that arises from\nmusic. The second kind of bodily pleasure is that which results from an undisturbed and vigorous\nconstitution of body, when life and active spirits seem to actuate every part. This lively health, when\nentirely free from all mixture of pain, of itself gives an inward pleasure, independent of all external\nobjects of delight; and though this pleasure does not so powerfully affect us, nor act so strongly on the\nsenses as some of the others, yet it may be esteemed as the greatest of all pleasures, and almost all the\nUtopians reckon it the foundation and basis of all the other joys of life; since this alone makes the state of\nlife easy and desirable; and when this is wanting, a man is really capable of no other pleasure. They look\nupon any freedom from pain unaccompanied by perfect health to be mere anaesthesia.\nThis subject has been closely discussed among them long ago: should a firm and entire health be\ncalled a pleasure or not? Some have thought that there was no pleasure but what was excited by some\nsensible motion in the body. But this opinion has been long ago excluded from among them, so that now\nthey almost universally agree that health is the greatest of all bodily pleasures; and that as there is a pain\nin sickness, which is as opposite in its nature to pleasure as it is to health, so they hold that health is\naccompanied with pleasure: and if any should say that sickness is not really pain, but only carries pain\nalong with it, they look upon that as a quibble that does not much alter the matter. It is all one, in their\nopinion, whether it be said that health is in itself a pleasure, or that it begets a pleasure, as fire gives heat;\nso it be granted, that all those whose health is entire have a true pleasure in the enjoyment of it: and they\nreason thus--what is the pleasure of eating, but that a man=s well-being, which had been weakened,\ndrives away hunger with food and so recovers its former vigor? And being thus refreshed, it finds a\npleasure in that conflict; and if the conflict is pleasure, the victory must yet breed a greater pleasure. Why\nshould we suppose that it becomes insensible as soon as it has obtained that which it pursued, and so\nneither experiences nor rejoices in its success? If it is said that health cannot be felt, they absolutely deny\nit; for what man is in health that does not perceive it when he is awake? Is there any man that is so dull\nand stupid as not to acknowledge that he feels a delight in health? And what is delight but another name\nfor pleasure?\nBut of all pleasures, they esteem those to be most valuable that lie in the mind, the chief of which\narises out of true virtue, and the witnesses of a good conscience. They account health the chief pleasure\nthat belongs to the body; for they think that the pleasure of eating and drinking, and all the other delights\nof sense, are only so far desirable as they give or maintain health, not pleasant in themselvesCjust as a\nway of resisting decline of one kind or another. For as a wise man desires rather to avoid diseases than to\ntake medicines, and to be freed from pain, rather than to find ease by remedies, so it is more pleasant not\nto hanker after food and drink than to overindulge them. If any man imagines that there is a real happiness\nin these enjoyments, he must then confess that he would be the happiest of all men if he were to lead his\nlife in perpetual hunger, thirst, and itching in order to be perpetually eating, drinking, and scratching\nhimself; which anyone may easily see would be not only a base but a miserable state of life. The bodily\nsatisfactions apart from health itself are indeed the lowest of pleasures and the least pure; for we can\nrelish them only when they are mixed with the contrary pains. The pain of hunger must give us the\npleasure of eating. Here the pain out-balances the pleasure; and as the pain is more vehement, so it lasts\nmuch longer; for as it begins before the pleasure, so it does not cease but with the pleasure that\nextinguishes it, and both expire together.\n\nThey think, therefore, none of those pleasures is to be valued any further than as it is necessary;\nyet they rejoice in them, and with due gratitude acknowledge the tenderness of Mother Nature, who has\nplanted in us appetites, by which those things that are necessary for our preservation are likewise made\npleasant to us. For how miserable a thing would life be, if those chronic illnesses of hunger and thirst\nwere to be carried off by such bitter drugs as we must use for those diseases that come less often upon us?\nAnd thus these pleasant as well as proper gifts of nature maintain the strength and the sprightliness of our\nbodies.\nThey also entertain themselves with the other delights let in at their eyes, their ears, and their\nnostrils, as the pleasant relishes and seasonings of life, which nature seems to have marked out peculiarly\nfor man; since no other sort of animals contemplates the figure and beauty of the universe, nor is\ndelighted with smells, any further than as they can find food by them; nor do they apprehend the concords\nor discords of sound. Yet in all pleasures whatsoever the Utopians take care that a lesser joy does not\nhinder a greater, and that pleasure may never breed pain, which they think always follows dishonest\npleasures. But they think it madness for a man to wear out the beauty of his face, or the force of his\nnatural strength; to corrupt the sprightliness of his body by sloth and laziness, or to waste it by fasting;\nthat it is madness to weaken the strength of his constitution, and reject the other delights of life; unless by\nrenouncing his own satisfaction, he can either serve the public or promote the happiness of others, for\nwhich he expects a greater recompense from God. So that they look upon an ascetic course of life as the\nmark of a mind that is both cruel to itself, and ungrateful to Nature, as if we did not wish to be in her debt\nfor her favors, and therefore reject all her blessings; as one who should torment himself for a pointless\nvirtue; or for no better end than to render himself capable of bearing misfortunes that may never happen.\nWell, that=s their notion of virtue and of pleasure; they think that no man=s reason can carry him\nto a truer idea of them, unless some discovery from heaven should inspire him with sublimer notions. I\nhave not now the leisure to examine whether they think right or wrong in this matter: nor do I judge it\nnecessary, for I have only undertaken to give you an account of their way of life, not to defend it. I am\nsure, that whatsoever may be said of their notions, there is not in the whole world either a better people or\na happier government: their bodies are vigorous and lively; and though they are but of a middle stature,\nand have neither the most fertile soil nor the purest air in the world, yet they fortify themselves by a well-\nbalanced diet so well that they are resistant to bad weather and by their industry they so cultivate their\nsoil, that there is nowhere to be seen a greater increase both of grain and cattle, nor are there anywhere\nhealthier men and freer from diseases: for one may there see reduced to practice, not only all the arts that\nthe farmer employs in manuring and improving an ill soil, but whole woods plucked up by the roots, and\nin other places new ones planted, where there were none before. Their principal motive for this is to make\ntransporting timber easy, by growing it either near their towns or on the banks of the sea or of some\nrivers, so as to be floated to them; for it is a harder work to carry wood at any distance over land, than\ngrain.\nThe people are industrious, apt to learn, as well as cheerful and pleasant; and none can endure\nmore labor, when it is necessary; but otherwise they love their leisure, for it gives them time to use their\nbrains. They are unwearied pursuers of knowledge; for when we had given them some hints of the\nlearning and discipline of the Greeks, concerning whom we only instructed them (for we know that there\nwas nothing among the Romans, except their historians and their poets, that they would value much), it\nwas strange to see how eagerly they were set on learning that language. We began to read a little of it to\nthem, rather in compliance with their importunity, than out of any hopes of their reaping from it any great\nadvantage. But after a very short trial, we found they made such progress, that we saw our labor was like\nto be more successful than we could have expected. They learned to write and speak the language so\nexactly, had so quick an apprehension, remembered it so faithfully, and became so ready and correct in\nthe use of it, that it would have looked like a miracle if the greater part of those whom we taught had not\nbeen men both of extraordinary capacity and of a fit age for instruction. They were for the greatest part\n\nchosen from among their learned men, by their chief Council, though some studied it of their own accord.\nIn three years= time they became masters of the whole language, so that they read the best of the Greek\nauthors very exactly. I am indeed apt to think that they learned that language the more easily, from its\nhaving some relation to their own. I believe that they were a colony of the Greeks; for though their\nlanguage comes nearer the Persian, yet they retain many names, both for their towns and public officials,\nthat are of Greek derivation.\nI happened to carry a great many books with me, instead of merchandise, when I sailed my fourth\nvoyage; for I was so far from thinking of soon coming back, that I rather thought never to have returned at\nall, and I gave them all my books, among which were many of Plato=s and some of Aristotle=s works. I\nhad also Theophrastus=s book on botany, which, to my great regret, was imperfect; for having laid it\ncarelessly by, while we were at sea, a monkey had seized upon it, and in many places torn out the leaves.\nI had no book of grammar but Lascaris, for I did not carry Theodorus with me; nor had I any dictionaries\nbut Hesichius and Dioscorides. They esteem Plutarch highly, and were much taken with Lucian=s wit and\nwith his pleasant way of writing. As for the poets, they now have Aristophanes, Homer, Euripides, and\nSophocles of Aldus=s edition; and for historians Thucydides, Herodotus, and Herodian. One of my\ncompanions, Master Pettytrifle3, happened to carry with him some of Hippocrates=s works, and Galen=s\nAArt of Medicine@, which they hold in great estimation; for though there is no nation in the world that\nneeds medicine so little as they do, yet there is not any that honors it so much: they reckon the knowledge\nof it one of the pleasantest and most profitable parts of natural philosophy, by which, as they search into\nthe secrets of nature, so they not only find this study highly agreeable, but think that such inquiries are\nvery acceptable to the Author of nature; and imagine that as He, like human craftsmen, had constructed\nthe great structure of the universe and exposed it to the view of the only creatures capable of\ncontemplating it, so an exact and curious observer, who admires His workmanship, is much more\nacceptable to Him than one of the herd, who, like a beast incapable of reason, looks on this glorious scene\nwith the eyes of a dull and unconcerned spectator.\n3Mr Tricius Apinatus, in the original. The name is composed of Martial=s expressed opinion of his own\npoems, that they were apinae tricaeque, that is, Atrifles and toys@.\n\nThe minds of the Utopians, when trained by their studies, are very ingenious in discovering all\nsuch arts as are necessary to make life comfortable. Two things they owe to us, the manufacture of paper\nand the art of printing: yet they are not so entirely indebted to us for these discoveries but that a great part\nof the invention was their own. We showed them some books printed by Aldus, we explained to them the\nway of making paper, and the mystery of printing; but as we had never practiced these arts, we described\nthem in a crude and superficial manner. They seized the hints we gave them, and though at first they\ncould not arrive at perfection, yet by making many essays they at last found out and corrected all their\nerrors, and conquered every difficulty. Before this they only wrote on parchment, on reeds, or on the bark\nof trees; but now they have established the manufacture of paper, and set up printing-presses, so that if\nthey had but a good number of Greek authors they would be quickly supplied with many copies of them:\nat present, though they have no more than those I have mentioned, yet by several impressions they have\nmultiplied them into many thousands.\nIf any man was to go among them that had some extraordinary talent, or that by much traveling\nhad observed the customs of many nations (which made us to be so well received), he would receive a\nhearty welcome; for they are very desirous to know the state of the whole world. Very few traders go\namong them, for what can a man carry to them but iron, and the Utopians think it better to manage their\nown exports than to leave it to foreigners, for by this means, as they understand the state of the\nneighboring countries better, so they keep up the art of navigation, which cannot be maintained but by\nmuch practice.\nThey do not make slaves of enemy civilians but only those taken in battle; nor of the offspring of\ntheir slaves, nor of those of other nations: the slaves among them are only such as are condemned to that\nstate of life for the commission of some crime, or, which is more common, such as their merchants find\ncondemned to die in those parts to which they trade, whom they sometimes redeem cheaply and in other\nplaces have them for nothing. They are kept at perpetual labor, and are always chained, but with this\ndifference, that the Utopian slaves are treated much worse than the foreign ones; they are considered as\nmore deplorable than the rest, since they could not be restrained by the advantages of so excellent an\neducation, and are therefore judged worthy of harder usage. Another sort of slaves are the poor of the\nneighboring countries, who offer of their own accord to come and serve them; they treat these still better,\nand use them in all other respects as well as the free Utopians, except for imposing more labor upon them,\nwhich is no hard task to those that have been accustomed to it; and if any of these have a mind to go back\nto their own country, which indeed falls out but seldom, as they do not force them to stay, so they let\nthem go freely and do not send them away empty-handed.\nI have already told you with what care they look after their sick, so that nothing is left undone that\ncan contribute either to their ease or health: and for those who are taken with fixed and incurable diseases,\nthey use all possible ways to cherish them, and to make their lives as comfortable as possible. They visit\nthem often, and take great pains to make their time pass off easily: but when any is taken with a torturing\nand lingering pain, so that there is no hope, either of recovery or ease, the priests and public officials\ncome and exhort them, that since they are now unable to go on with the business of life and have become\na burden to themselves and to all about them, they have really outlived themselves; they should no longer\nnourish a perpetual disease but choose rather to die, since they cannot live but in much misery: being\nassured, that if they thus deliver themselves from torture, or are willing that others should do it, they shall\nbe happy after death. Since by their acting thus, they lose none of the pleasures but only the troubles of\nlife, they think they behave not only reasonably, but in a manner consistent with religion and piety;\nbecause they follow the advice given them by their priests, who are expounders of the will of God. Such\nas are wrought on by these persuasions, either starve themselves of their own accord, or take opium, and\nby that means die without pain. But no man is forced on this way of ending his life; and if they cannot be\npersuaded to it, this does not induce others to fail in their attendance and care of them; but because they\nbelieve that a voluntary death must be reasonable to be honorable, so if you commit suicide for reasons\n\nthe priests and the Greathogs think inadequate, they give you none of the honors of a decent funeral but\njust throw your body into a ditch.\nTheir women are not married before eighteen, nor their men before two-and-twenty, and if any of\nthem run into forbidden embraces before marriage they are severely punished, and the privilege of\nmarriage is denied them, unless they can obtain a special license from the Mayor. Such conduct casts a\ngreat reproach upon the master and mistress of the household in which they happen, for it is supposed that\nthey have failed in their duty. The reason of punishing this so severely is, because they think that if they\nwere not strictly restrained from all vagrant appetites, very few would engage in marriageBa state in\nwhich one risks the quiet of the rest of one=s life, being confined to one person and having to endure all\nthe inconveniences of the arrangement.\nIn choosing their wives they use a method that would appear to us very absurd and ridiculous, but\nit is constantly observed among them, and is accounted perfectly consistent with wisdom. Before\nmarriage some grave matron presents the bride naked, whether she is a virgin or a widow, to the\nbridegroom; and after that some grave man presents the bridegroom naked to the bride. We indeed both\nlaughed at this, and condemned it as very indecent. But they, on the other hand, wondered at the folly of\nthe men of all other nations, who, if they are but to buy a horse of a small value, are so cautious that they\nwill see every part of him, and take off both his saddle and all his other tackle, that there may be no secret\nulcer hid under any of them; and that yet in the choice of a wife, on which depends the happiness or\nunhappiness of the rest of his life, a man should venture upon trust, and only see about a hand=s-breadth\nof the face, all the rest of the body being covered, under which there may lie hid what may be contagious\nas well as loathsome. All men are not so wise as to choose a woman only for her good qualities; and even\nwise men consider the body as that which adds not a little to the mind: and it is certain there may be some\nsuch deformity covered with the clothes as may totally alienate a man from his wife when it is too late to\npart from her. If such a thing is discovered after marriage, a man has no remedy but patience, and a\nwoman likewise. They therefore think it is reasonable that there should be good provision made against\nsuch mischievous frauds.\nThere was so much the more reason for them to make a regulation in this matter, because they are\nthe only people of those parts that neither allow of polygamy nor of divorces, except in the case of\nadultery or insufferable perverseness; for in these cases the Council dissolves the marriage and grants the\ninjured person leave to marry again; but the guilty are made infamous and never allowed the privilege of a\nsecond marriage. None are allowed to divorce their wives against their wills from any great calamity that\nmay have fallen on their persons; for they look on it as the height of cruelty and treachery to abandon\neither of the married persons when they need most the tender care of their comfort, and that chiefly in the\ncase of old age, which as it carries many diseases along with it, so it is a disease of itself. But it frequently\nfalls out that when a married couple do not well agree, they by mutual consent separate and find out other\npersons with whom they hope they may live more happily. Yet this is not done without obtaining leave of\nthe Council, which never admits of a divorce but upon a strict inquiry made, both by the Greathogs and\ntheir wives, into the grounds upon which it is desired; and even when they are satisfied concerning the\nreasons of it, they go on but slowly, for they imagine that too great easiness in granting leave for new\nmarriages would very much shake the tie of married people.\nThey punish adultery severely. If both parties are married they are divorced, and the injured\npersons may marry one another, or whom they please; but the adulterer and the adulteress are condemned\nto slavery. Yet if either of the injured persons cannot shake off the love of the married person, they may\nlive with them still in that state, but they must follow them to that labor to which the slaves are\ncondemned; and sometimes the repentance of the condemned, together with the unshaken kindness of the\ninnocent and injured person, has prevailed so far with the Mayor that he has taken off the sentence; but\nthose that relapse after they are once pardoned are punished with death. Otherwise, their laws do not\n\ndetermine the punishment for crime, but it is left to the Council to temper it according to the\ncircumstances. Husbands have power to correct their wives, and parents to chastise their children, unless\nthe fault is so great that a public punishment is thought necessary for striking terror into others. For the\nmost part, slavery is the punishment even of the greatest crimes, for as that is no less terrible to the\ncriminals themselves than death, so they think the preserving them in a state of servitude is more for the\ninterest of the commonwealth than killing them; as their labor is a greater benefit to the public than their\ndeath could be, so the sight of their misery is a more lasting terror to other men than that which would be\ngiven by their death. If their slaves rebel, and will not bear their yoke and submit to the labor that is\nenjoined them, they are treated as wild beasts that cannot be kept in order by prison or chains and are put\nto death. But those are not out of hope who bear their punishment patiently and are so much worked upon\nby their punishment that it appears they are really more troubled for the crimes they have committed than\nfor the miseries they suffer; for it may happen at last that either the Mayor by his prerogative or the\npeople by their intercession will restore them again to liberty, or at least much mitigate their slavery. He\nthat tempts a married woman to adultery is no less severely punished than he that commits it; for they\nbelieve that a deliberate design to commit a crime is equal to the fact itself: since its not taking effect does\nnot make the person that miscarried in his attempt at all the less guilty.\nThey take great pleasure in people with mental deficiencies, and as it is thought a base and\nunbecoming thing to use them ill, so they do not think it amiss for people to divert themselves with their\nincompetent speech and behavior: and, in the Utopian opinion, this is a great benefit to the defectives: for\nif no one were amused by their ridiculous behavior and foolish sayings, it could not be expected that\nanyone would trouble to look after them or use them so tenderly as they must otherwise be. But if any\nman should reproach another for his being misshaped or imperfect in any part of his body, it would not at\nall be thought a reflection on the person so treated, but it would be accounted stupid in him that had\nupbraided another with what he could not help. At the same time, it is thought a sign of a sluggish and\nsordid mind not to preserve carefully one=s natural beauty; but it is likewise infamous among them to use\ncosmetics. They all see that no beauty recommends a wife so much to her husband as the probity of her\nlife, and her obedience: for some few are caught only by beauty, but all are held only by virtue and a\nrespectful attitude towards themselves.\nAs they fright men from committing crimes by punishments, so they invite them to the love of\nvirtue by public honors: therefore they erect statues to the memories of such worthy men as have deserved\nwell of their country, and set these in their market-places, both to perpetuate the remembrance of their\nactions, and to be an incitement to their posterity to follow their example. But anyone who campaigns for\na public office is forbidden from ever holding one. They all live easily together, for none of the public\nofficials are either insolent or cruel to the people: they affect rather to be called fathers, and by being\nreally so, they well deserve the name; and the people pay them all the marks of honor the more freely,\nbecause none are exacted from them. The Mayor himself has no distinction, either of garments or of a\ncrown; but is only distinguished by a sheaf of grain carried before him; as the high-priest is also known\nby his being preceded by a person carrying a candle.\nThey have but few laws, and such is their constitution that they need not many. They very much\ncondemn other nations, whose laws, together with the commentaries on them, swell up to so many\nvolumes; for they think it an unreasonable thing to oblige men to obey a body of laws that is too prolix for\nan ordinary person to read right through and so complicated that it cannot be understood without special\ntraining. They have no lawyers among them, for they consider them as a sort of people whose profession\nit is to disguise matters and to twist the laws; and therefore they think it is much better that every man\nshould plead his own cause, and trust to the judge, as in other countries the client trusts a counselor. By\nthis means they both cut off many delays and find out truth more certainly: for after the parties have laid\nopen the merits of the cause, without those artifices which lawyers are apt to suggest, the judge examines\nthe whole matter, and assists well-meaning persons too simple to plead their case properly, whom\n\notherwise crafty men would be sure to run down: and thus they avoid those evils which appear very\nremarkably among all those nations that labor under a vast load of laws. Every Utopian has expert legal\nknowledge, for as it is a very short study, so the plainest meaning of which words are capable is always\nthe sense of their laws. And they argue thus: all laws are promulgated for this end, that every man may\nknow his duty; and therefore the plainest and most obvious sense of the words is that which ought to be\nput upon them; since a more refined exposition cannot be easily comprehended, and would only serve to\nmake the laws become useless to the greater part of mankind, and especially to those who need most the\ndirection of them: for it is all one, not to make a law at all, or to couch it in such terms that without a\nquick apprehension, and much study, a man cannot find out the true meaning of it; since the generality of\nmankind are both so dull and so much employed in their several trades that they have neither the leisure\nnor the capacity requisite for such an inquiry.\nSome of their neighbors, who are masters of their own liberties, having long ago been liberated\nfrom tyranny by the Utopians and admiring their good qualities, have come to desire that the Utopians\nsend public officials to govern them; some changing them every year, and others every five years. At the\nend of their government they bring these governors back to Utopia, with great expressions of honor and\nesteem, and carry away others to govern in their place. In this they seem to have fallen upon a very good\nexpedient for their own happiness and safety; for since the good or ill condition of a nation depends so\nmuch upon their public officials, they could not have made a better choice than by pitching on men whom\nno advantages can bias; for wealth is of no use to them, since they must so soon go back to their own\ncountry; and they being strangers among them, are not engaged in any of their heats or animosities; and it\nis certain that when public administration is influenced by money and bias there must follow a dissolution\nof justice, the chief sinew of society.\nThe Utopians call those nations that come and ask public officials from them, neighbors; but\nthose to whom they have been of help to them, friends. But they never make actual treaties with other\nnations. Treaties, they think, are useless things. They believe that all human beings are allies by nature,\nand if anyone is ready to ignore the fundamental bond of humanity, what good will a parcel of words do\nto knit men together? Faith of promises will have no great effect; they are confirmed in this by what they\nsee among the nations round about them, who are no strict observers of leagues and treaties. Of course,\nwe know how religiously they are observed in Europe, more particularly where the Christian doctrine is\nreceived, among whom they are sacred and inviolable; which is partly owing to the justice and goodness\nof our kings and princes, and partly to the reverence they pay to the Popes; who as they are most religious\nobservers of their own promises, so they exhort all other rulers to perform theirs; and when fainter\nmethods do not prevail, they compel them to it by the severity of Papal rebuke, and think that it would be\nthe most indecent thing possible if men who are particularly distinguished by the title of the Afaithful@\nshould not religiously keep the faith of their treaties. But in that newfound world, which is not more\ndistant from us in situation than the people are in their manners and course of life, there is no trusting to\nleagues, even though they were made with all the pomp of the most sacred ceremonies; on the contrary,\nthey are on this account the sooner broken, some slight pretense being found in the words of the treaties,\nwhich are purposely couched in such ambiguous terms that they can never be so strictly bound but they\nwill always find some loophole to escape at; and thus they break both their treaties and their faith.\nAnd this is done with such impudence, that those very men who value themselves on having\nsuggested these tricks to their rulers, would with a haughty scorn declaim against such craft, or, to speak\nplainer, such fraud and deceit, if they found private men making use of it in their bargains, and would\nreadily say that they deserved to be hanged. By this means it is, that all sorts of justice passes in the world\nfor a low-spirited and vulgar virtue, far below the dignity of royal greatness. Or rather, there are set up\ntwo sorts of justice; the one is mean, and creeps on the ground, and therefore becomes none but the lower\npart of mankind, and so must be tethered by many restraints that it may not break out beyond the bounds\nthat are set to it; and the other is the peculiar virtue of those in power, which, because it is more majestic\n\nthan those of ordinary folk, is free to do as it likes. Anyway, that is how kings behave in the new world,\nwhich is why the Utopians make no treaties. Perhaps they would change their mind if they lived among\nus; but yet though treaties were more religiously observed, they would still dislike the custom of making\nthem; for they regard all treaties as wrong in principle As if being separated perhaps by a mountain or a\nriver cut the ties of humanity and everyone were born in a state of hostility, and so might lawfully do\nmischief to their neighbors unless there were a treaty to prevent it! In any case, when treaties are made,\nthey do not cut off enmity or restrain open hostility, if the provisos against them are badly worded. The\nUtopians, in contrast, judge that no man is to be esteemed our enemy that has never injured us; that the\npartnership of the human nature is more effective than a military alliance; and that kindness and\ngood-nature unite men more effectually and with greater strength than any agreements whatsoever; since\nthereby the engagements of men=s hearts become stronger than the bond and obligation of words.\nUtopians detest war as a very brutal thing, which is more practiced by men than beasts, to the\nshame of human nature. They think that there is nothing more inglorious than glory gained by war. And\ntherefore though they accustom themselves daily to military exercises and the discipline of warBin which\nnot only their men but their women are trainedByet they do not rashly engage in war, unless it be to\ndefend themselves or their friends from aggressors; or out of good-nature or in compassion assist an\noppressed nation in shaking off the yoke of tyranny. They indeed help their friends, not only in defense\nbut also in making reprisals for aggressions; but they never do that unless they had been consulted well in\nadvance and are satisfied that all demands of reparation were rejected, so that a war was unavoidable.\nThis they think to be not only just, when one neighbor robs another by force of arms, but also when the\nmerchants of one country are oppressed by legal injustice in another. This they count a better cause of war\nprecisely because unjust laws are used to excuse it .\nThis was how the war between the Seenots and the Cloudfolk started, a little before our time; for\nthe merchants of Seenot had met, so the Utopians thought, great injustice among the Seenots. Whether\nthey were right or wrong, there ensued a terrible war, involving scads of countries; and their keenness in\ncarrying it on being supported by their strength in maintaining it, it not only shook some and very much\nafflicted others, but ended in the entire conquest and slavery of Seenot, who though before the war was\nmuch superior to the Cloudfolk; but though the Utopians had assisted the Cloudfolk in the war, yet they\ntook no share of spoil.\nBut though they so vigorously assist their friends in obtaining reparation for the injuries they have\nreceived in affairs of this nature, yet if any such frauds were committed against themselves, provided no\nviolence was done to their persons, they would simply refuse trading with such a people. This is not\nbecause they favor their neighbors more than their own citizens; but since their neighbors trade everyone\nupon his own stock, fraud is a more sensible injury to them than it is to the Utopians, among whom\neveryone shares the loss. As they expect nothing in return for the merchandise they export but that in\nwhich they so much abound and is of little use to them, the loss does not much affect them; they think\ntherefore it would be too severe to revenge so trivial a loss with the death of many persons. But if any of\ntheir people is either killed or wounded wrongfully, whether it be done by public authority or only by\nprivate men, as soon as they hear of it they send ambassadors, and demand that the guilty persons may be\ndelivered up to them. If that is denied, they declare war; if it be granted, the offenders are condemned\neither to death or slavery.\nThey would be both troubled and ashamed of a bloody victory over their enemies, and think it\nstupid to pay such a high price for anything, whatever its value. And in no victory do they glory so much\nas in that which is gained by diplomacy, without bloodshed. In such cases they appoint public triumphs,\nand erect trophies to the honor of those who have succeeded; for then do they reckon that a man acts\nsuitably to his nature when he conquers his enemy in such a way as that no other creature but a man could\nbe capable of, and that is by the strength of his understanding. Bears, lions, boars, wolves, and dogs, and\n\nall other animals employ their bodily force one against another, in which as many of them are superior to\nmen, both in strength and fierceness, so they are all subdued by his reason and understanding. The only\ndesign of the Utopians in war is to obtain that by force which would have prevented the war if it had been\ngranted in time; or if that cannot be done, to take so severe a revenge on those that have injured them that\nthey may be terrified from doing the like for the time to come. By these ends they measure all their\ndesigns, and so it=s clear that national prestige is never an issue for them.\nAs soon as they declare war, they take care to have a great many posters fixed in the most\nconspicuous places of their enemies= country all at once. In these they promise great rewards to such as\nshall kill the enemy ruler, and lesser in proportion to such as shall kill any other persons on whom the\nruler chiefly depends in case of war. And they double the sum to him that, instead of killing the person so\nmarked out, shall take him alive and put him in their hands. They also offer both pardon and rewards to\nthe persons named in the posters, if they will act against their associates; by this means those that are\nnamed become not only distrustful of their fellow- citizens but of one another, and are much distracted by\nfear and danger; for it has often fallen out that many of them, and even the ruler himself, have been\nbetrayed by those in whom they have trusted most; for the rewards that the Utopians offer are so\nunmeasurably great, that there is no sort of crime to which men cannot be drawn by them. They consider\nthe risk that those run who undertake such services, and offer a recompense proportioned to the danger;\nnot only a vast deal of gold, but great revenues in lands, that lie among other nations that are their friends,\nwhere they may go and enjoy them very securely; and they observe the promises they make of this kind\nmost faithfully.\nThey very much approve of this way of corrupting their enemies, though it appears to others to be\nbase and cruel; but they look on it as a wise course, to make an end of what would be otherwise a long\nwar without so much as hazarding one battle to decide it. They think it likewise an act of mercy and love\nto mankind to prevent the great slaughter of those that must otherwise be killed in the progress of the war,\nboth on their own side and on that of their enemies, by the death of a few that are most guilty; and that in\nso doing they are kind even to their enemies, and pity them no less than their own people, as knowing that\nthe greater part of them do not engage in the, war of their own accord but are forced into by the powers\nthat be. If this method does not succeed with them, then they sow seeds of contention among their\nenemies, and animate the king=s brother, or some of the nobility, to aspire to the crown. If they cannot\ndisunite them by domestic broils, then they engage their neighbors against them, and make them set on\nfoot some old claims, which are never wanting among rival nations when they have occasion for them.\nThey supply the claimant nation with money, though but very sparingly with any auxiliary troops: for\nthey are so tender of their own people, that they would not willingly exchange one of them, even for the\nking of their enemies= country; but they easily part with money for it wouldn=t affect their standard of\nliving to spend all of it. And so they do most of their fighting mercenaries4. . . . Next to these they are\nserved in their wars with those upon whose account they undertake them, and with the auxiliary troops of\ntheir other friends, to whom they join a few of their own people, and send some men of eminent and\napproved virtue to command in chief. There are two sent with him, who during his command are but\nprivate men, but the first is to succeed him if he should happen to be either killed or taken; and in case of\nthe like misfortune to him, the third comes in his place; and thus they provide against ill events, that such\naccidents as may befall their generals may not endanger their armies.\nWhen they conscript their own people for military service abroad, they take only volunteers,\n4Omitted here is a description of the Zapolites, a name constructed out of Greek roots that signify a people\nwho trade heavily in anything. They are the universal mercenaries in More=s imaginary New World, rude and\nsavage barbarians, who never betray a contract for hire but never sign on for any length of time and so, with due\nnotice, will change sides when more money is on offer. Their business is shedding blood. In point of loyalty, the\nupper managerial staff of large corporations resemble the Zapolites.\n\nbecause they think that nervous people make bad soldiers. But if an invasion is made on their country\nthey subject everyone fit for service to the draft and put the cowards aboard their ships or place them on\nthe walls of their towns, that being so posted they may find no opportunity of flying away; and thus either\nshame, the heat of action, or the impossibility of flying, bears down their cowardice; and in the last resort,\nthey often fight well. But as they force no man to go a foreign war, so they do not hinder those women\nwho want to go with their husbands; on the contrary, they encourage and praise them, and they often fight\nbeside of their husbands. They also place together those who are related, parents and children, kindred,\nand those that are mutually allied, near one another; that those whom nature has inspired with the greatest\nzeal for assisting one another, may be the nearest and readiest to do it; and it is matter of great reproach if\nhusband or wife survive one another, or if a child survives his parents, and therefore when they come to\nbe engaged in action they continue to fight to the last man, if their enemies do not run away.\nSo long as they can use mercenaries, the Utopians keep out of battle, but when they must fight,\ntheir courage is equal to their earlier caution. It rises by degrees; and as they continue in action, they\ngrow more obstinate and press harder upon the enemy, insomuch that they will much sooner die than give\nground; for the certainty that their children will be well looked after when they are dead frees them from\nthe anxieties that often undermines courage; and thus they are animated by a noble and invincible\nresolution. Their skill in military affairs helps, too; and the wise sentiments which, according to the laws\nof their country, are instilled into them in their education, give additional vigor to their minds: for as they\ndo not undervalue life so as to throw it away, they are not so indecently fond of it as to preserve it by base\nand unbecoming methods. At the height of battle, the bravest of their youth form a special group to\nknock out the enemy general by every possible means anywhere in the battlefield; and these, when spent\nand wearied out, are relieved by others, who never give over the pursuit; so that unless he secures himself\nby flight, they seldom fail at last to kill or to take him prisoner.\nWhen they have obtained a victory, they prefer taking prisoners to killing the conquered; nor do\nthey ever let their men so loose in pursuit of their enemies, as not to retain an entire body still in order of\nbattle. They are mindful how often they had turned the tide of battle, falling back themselves but\nmanaging to triumph in the end, thanks to the disorder in which the apparently victorious army was\npursuing them. It is hard to tell whether they are more cunning in offense or defense. They sometimes\nseem to fly when it is far from their thoughts; and when they really mean to retreat, you=d never guess it\nfrom looking at them. In any case, it is no less dangerous to fall upon them in a retreat than in an\nadvance. . . . All that are trained up to war practice swimming, so that they can swim rivers with their\narmor on. Both horse and foot make great use of arrows, and are very expert. They have no swords, but\nfight with heavy pole-axes, by which they strike down an enemy. They are very good at inventing warlike\nmachines, and disguise them so well, that the enemy does not perceive them till he feels the use of them;\nso that he cannot prepare such a defense as would render them useless. If they agree to a truce, they\nobserve it so religiously that no provocations will make them break it. They never lay their enemies=\ncountry waste nor burn their grain, and even take care that neither horse nor foot may tread it down, for\nthey do not know but that they may have use for it themselves. They hurt no man whom they find\ndisarmed, unless he is a spy. When a town is surrendered to them, they take it into their protection; and\nwhen they carry a place by storm, they never plunder it, but just kill those who opposed surrender, and\nmake the rest of the army slaves, but for civilians, they do them no hurt; and if any of them had advised a\nsurrender, they give them good rewards out of the estates of those that they condemn, and distribute the\nrest among their auxiliary troops, but they themselves take no share of the spoil.\nWhen a war is ended, they do not oblige their friends to reimburse their expenses; but they obtain\nthem of the conquered, either in money, which they keep for the next occasion, or in lands, out of which a\nconstant revenue is to be paid them; by many increases, the revenue which they draw out from several\ncountries on such occasions, is now risen to above 700,000 ducats a year. They send some of their own\npeople to receive these revenues, who have orders to live magnificently and play-act the role of important\n\npeople, by which means they consume much of it upon the place; and either bring over the rest to Utopia,\nor lend it to the nation which pays it. This they most commonly do, unless some great occasion, which\nfalls out but very seldom, should oblige them to call for it.\nAs for Utopian religious ideas, they have several religions, not only in different parts of the\nisland, but even in every town; some worshiping the sun, others the moon or one of the planets: some\nworship such men as have been eminent in former times for virtue or glory, not only as ordinary gods, but\nas the supreme god: yet the greater and wiser sort of them worship none of these, but believe there is an\ninvisible, infinite, and incomprehensible divine power far above all our apprehensions, that is spread over\nthe whole universe, not as substance but as force. This force they call AFather@, and credit Him with the\norigins, increase, progress, changes, endings of all things; nor do they recognize any other gods. And\nindeed, though they differ concerning other things, yet all agree in this, that they think there is one\nSupreme Being that made and governs the world, whom they call in the language of their country Mithra.\nThey differ in this and that; but they all agree in one principle, that whoever is this Supreme Being, He is\nalso that great Essence to whose glory and majesty all honors are ascribed by the consent of all nations.\nBy degrees, they fall off from the various superstitions among them, and adopt the more\nreasonable ones; and there is no doubt but that all the others would have vanished long ago, if some of\nthose who advised them to lay aside their superstitions had not met with some unhappy accident, which\nbeing considered as inflicted by heaven was looked upon as punishment by the god whose authority had\nbeen denied. But after they had heard from us an account of the doctrine, the course of life, and the\nmiracles of Christ, and of the wonderful constancy of the martyrs whose blood, so willingly offered, was\nmeans of converting so many nations to the Christian faith, you cannot imagine how inclined they were to\nreceive it. Whether this proceeded from any secret inspiration of God, or whether it was because it\nseemed so favorable to that community of goods which they already practiced, I cannot tell; since they\nperceived that Christ and his followers lived by that rule5 and that it was still kept up in some\ncommunities among the sincerest sort of Christians. From whichsoever of these motives it might be, true\nit is that many of them came over to our religion, and were initiated into it by baptism. But as none of us\nwere in priest=s orders; we therefore could only baptize them; so that to our great regret they could not\npartake of the other sacraments, that can only be administered by priests; but they are instructed\nconcerning them, and long most vehemently for them. They have had great disputes among themselves,\nwhether one chosen by them to be a priest would not be thereby qualified to do all the things that belong\nto that character, even though he had no authority derived from the Pope; and they seemed to be resolved\nto choose some for that employment, but they had not done it when I left them.\nThose among them that have not accepted Christianity do not discourage others from it, and use\nnone ill who convert; so that all the while I was there, one man was only punished on this occasion. He\nbeing newly baptized, did, notwithstanding all that we could say to the contrary, dispute publicly\nconcerning the Christian religion with more zeal than discretion; and with so much heat, that he not only\npreferred our worship to theirs, but condemned all their rites as profane; and cried out against all that\nadhered to them, as impious and sacrilegious persons, that were to be damned to everlasting burnings.\nUpon his having frequently preached in this manner, he was seized, and after trial he was condemned to\nbanishment, not for having disparaged their religion, but for disturbing the peace. For this is one of their\nmost ancient laws, that no man ought to be punished for his religion. At the first constitution of their\ngovernment, Utopos having understood that before his coming among them the old inhabitants had been\nengaged in great quarrels concerning religion, by which they were so divided among themselves, that he\nfound it an easy thing to conquer them, after he had subdued them, he made a law that every man might\nbe of what religion he pleased, and might endeavor to draw others to it by reasonable argument, quietly\n5An allusion to Acts, ii, 44-5 and iv, 32, which make clear that communicants of the early Church held\nproperty in common.\n\nand politely, but without bitterness against those of other opinions or violence or personal abuse; and such\nas did otherwise were to be condemned to banishment or slavery.\nThis law was made by Utopos, not only for preserving the public peace, which he saw suffered\nmuch by daily contentions and irreconcilable heats, but because he thought the interest of religion itself\nrequired it. He judged it unfit to determine anything rashly and seemed open to the idea that different\nforms of religion all came from God, who inspired different men in different ways and was pleased with\nthe variety; he certainly thought it stupid for anyone to threaten and terrify a man to make him believe\nwhat did not appear to him true. And supposing that only one religion was really true and the rest\nfalseBUtopos imagined that the native force of truth would at last break forth and shine bright, if\nsupported only by the strength of argument, and attended to with a gentle and unprejudiced mind; while,\non the other hand, if such debates were carried on with violence and tumults, as the most wicked are\nalways the most obstinate, so the best and most holy religion might be choked with superstition, as grain\nis with briars and thorns.\nHe therefore left all free to believe as they should see cause; only he made a solemn and severe\nlaw against such as should so far degenerate from the dignity of human nature as to think that our souls\ndied with our bodies, or that the world was governed by chance, without a wise overruling Providence.\nFor a man of such principles must despise all laws and customs as long as he thinks that he can get away\nwith it: for there is no doubt to be made that a man who is afraid of nothing but the law, and apprehends\nnothing after death, will not scruple to break through all the laws of his country, either by fraud or force,\nwhen by this means he may gain his ends. The Utopian, therefore, never raise any that hold these maxims,\neither to honors or offices, nor employ them in any public trust, but despise them, as men of base and\nsordid minds: yet they do not punish them, because they lay this down as a maxim that a man cannot\nmake himself believe anything he pleases; nor do they drive any to dissemble their thoughts by threats, so\nthat men are not tempted to lie or disguise their opinions; which being a sort of fraud, is abhorred by the\nUtopians. They take care indeed to prevent their arguing in defense of these opinions, especially before\nthe common people; but they suffer, and even encourage them to dispute concerning them in private with\ntheir priests and other persons of learning, being confident that they will be cured of those mad opinions\nby having reason laid before them.\nThere are many among them that run far to the other extreme (though it is neither thought an ill\nnor unreasonable opinion, and therefore is not at all discouraged); I refer to those who think that the souls\nof beasts are immortal, though far inferior to the dignity of the human soul, and not capable of so great a\nhappiness. As for human happiness, almost all Utopians are firmly persuaded that good men will be\ninfinitely happy in another state; so that though they sympathize with sick, yet they lament no one=s\ndeath, unless they see that person unhappy to depart this life; for they look on this as a very ill presage, as\nif the soul, conscious to itself of guilt, and quite hopeless, was afraid to leave the body, from some secret\nhint of approaching misery. Besides, they think that God will not be pleased to see a person who does not\nanswer His call cheerfully, but is backward and unwilling, and is, as it were, dragged to go before Him.\nThey are struck with horror when they see any die in this manner, and carry them out in silence and with\nsorrow, and praying God that he would be merciful to the errors of the departed soul, they lay the body in\nthe ground; but when any die cheerfully and full of hope, they do not mourn them but sing hymns when\nthey carry out their bodies, and commend their souls very earnestly to God: their whole behavior is then\nrather grave than sad, they cremate the body and set up a pillar inscribed in honor of the deceased.\nWhen they come from the funeral, they discourse of his good life and worthy actions, but speak\nof nothing oftener and with more pleasure than of his serenity at the hour of death. They think that this\nkind of respect is the best way of encouraging the living and also the best way pleasing the dead; for they\nbelieve that the dead, though invisible, are present among us, and hear those discourses that pass\nconcerning themselves. They believe it inconsistent with the happiness of departed souls not to be at\n\nliberty where they will and able to see whomever they loved in life; they are persuaded that good men\nafter death have all their affections and good dispositions increased rather than diminished, and therefore\nconclude that they move among the living, and observe all they say or do; and this gives them greater\nconfidence in the success of all their affairs. Further, this opinion of the presence of their ancestors\ndiscourages bad behavior in private.\nThey despise and laugh at omens and the other vain and superstitious ways of telling the future,\nso much observed among other nations; but have great reverence for such miracles as cannot flow from\nany of the powers of nature, and look on them as effects and indications of the presence of the Supreme\nBeing, of which they say many instances have occurred among them; and that sometimes their public\nprayers, which upon great and dangerous occasions they have solemnly put up to God, with assured\nconfidence of being heard, have been answered in a miraculous manner.\nThey think that contemplating God by studying the natural world is a very acceptable piece of\nworship to Him. There are many among them, however, that upon a motive of religion neglect learning,\nand apply themselves to no sort of study; nor do they allow themselves any leisure time, but are\nperpetually employed in good works, believing that the good things a person does secures happiness after\ndeath. Some of these visit the sick; others mend highways, cleanse ditches, repair bridges, or dig turf,\ngravel, or stones. Others fell and cleave timber, and bring wood, grain, and other necessaries on carts into\ntheir towns. Nor do these only serve the public, but they serve even private men, more than the slaves\nthemselves do; for if there is anywhere a rough, hard, and sordid piece of work to be done, from which\nmany are frightened by the labor and loathsomeness of it, if not the despair of accomplishing it, they\ncheerfully and of their own accord, take that to their share; and by that means, as they ease others very\nmuch, so they afflict themselves, and spend their whole life in hard labor; and yet they do not value\nthemselves upon this, nor blame others while boasting about their virtue; but by their stooping to such\nservile employments, they are so far from being despised that they are esteemed by the whole nation.\nOf these there are two sorts; some live unmarried and chaste and are vegetarians; and thus\nweaning themselves from all the pleasures of the present life, which they account hurtful, they pursue,\neven by the hardest and most painful methods possible that blessedness which they hope for hereafter;\nAnother sort is less willing to put themselves to much toil, and therefore prefer a married state to a single\none; and as they do not deny themselves the pleasure of it, so they think the begetting of children is a debt\nwhich they owe to human nature and to their country; nor do they avoid any pleasure that does not hinder\nlabor, and therefore eat meat so much the more willingly, as they find that by this means they are the\nmore able to work; the Utopians look upon these as the wiser sect, but they esteem the others as the more\nholy. They would indeed laugh at any man, who from the principles of reason would prefer an unmarried\nstate to a married or a life of labor to an easy life; but they reverence and admire such as do it from the\nmotives of religion. There is nothing in which they are more cautious than in judging anybody=s religion.\nThe men that lead those severe lives are called in the language of their country Rumenators, which\ncorresponds to those we call religious ordersBmonks, friars, and the like.\nTheir priests are men of eminent piety, which means there aren=t many of them; there are only\nthirteen in every town, one for every church, with one set over the rest as Bishop; but when they go to\nwar, seven of the ordinary priest go out with their forces, and seven others are chosen as temporary\nsubstitutes; those who return get their old jobs back and the substitutes attend upon the local Bishop till\nvacancies fall by death. The priests are chosen by secret ballot as the other public officials are, to prevent\nthe formation of pressure groups; and when they are chosen they are consecrated by their colleagues. The\ncare of all sacred things, the worship of God, and an inspection of the people=s morals are committed to\nthem. It is a reproach to a man to be sent for by any of them or to be admonished by them. All that they\ncan do, of course, is to exhort and admonish; for the power of punishing belongs wholly to the Mayor and\nother public officials. The severest thing that the priest does is excommunicate the wicked from joining in\n\nworship. There is not any sort of punishment more dreaded, for as it loads them with infamy, so it fills\nthem with secret horrors, such is their reverence to their religion; nor will their bodies be long exempted\nfrom their share of trouble; for if they do not very quickly satisfy the priests of the truth of their\nrepentance, they are seized on by the Greathogs and punished for their impiety. The education of youth\nbelongs to the priests, who instruct their pupils in letters and in moral principles; they use all possible\nmethods to infuse very early into the tender and flexible minds of children such opinions as are both good\nin themselves and will be useful to their country. For when deep impressions of these things are made at\nthat age, they follow men through the whole course of their lives, and conduce much to preserve the peace\nof the government, which suffers by nothing more than by vices that rise out of wrong ideas.\nThe wives of their priests are the most highly regarded of the whole country; sometimes the\nwomen themselves are made priests, though that falls out but seldom, nor are any but ancient widows\nchosen into that order. None of the public officials has greater honor paid him than is paid the priests; and\nif any priest should happen to commit any crime, he would not be questioned for it. His punishment is\nleft to God and to his own conscience; for they do not think it lawful to lay hands on any man, how\nwicked soever he is, that has been in a peculiar manner dedicated to God; nor do they find any great\ndifficulty in this, both because they have so few priests, and because these are chosen with much caution,\nso that it must be a very unusual thing to find one who degenerates into corruption and vice. And if such a\nthing should fall out, for man is a changeable creature, yet there being few priests, and these having no\nauthority but what rises out of the respect that is paid them, they pose no danger to the public. The\nnumber of the priests is kept down lest greater numbers sharing in the same honor might make the dignity\nof that order which they esteem so highly to sink in its reputation. They also think it difficult to find out\nmany of such an exalted pitch of goodness, as to be equal to that dignity which demands the exercise of\nmore than ordinary virtues.\nNor are the priests in greater veneration among them than they are among their neighboring\nnations, as you may imagine when I tell you the reason for it. When the Utopians engage in battle, the\npriests who accompany them to the war kneel down during the action a short way off; and lifting up their\nhands to heaven, pray, first for peace, and then for victory to their own side, and particularly that it may\nbe gained without much blood on either side; and when the victory turns to their side, they run in among\ntheir own men to restrain their fury; and if any of their enemies see them, or call to them, they are\npreserved by that means; and such as can come so near them as to touch their garments, have not only\ntheir lives, but their fortunes secured to them. Because all the nations round about consider them so\nmuch, and treat them with such reverence, the Utopian priests have been often just as able to preserve\ntheir own people as to save their enemies ; for it has sometimes fallen out, that when the Utopian army\nhave been in disorder, and forced to fly, so that their enemies were running upon the slaughter and spoil,\nthe priests by interposing have separated them from one another, and stopped the effusion of more blood;\nso that by their mediation a reasonable peace has been concluded. Nor is there any nation about them so\nfierce, cruel, or barbarous as not to look upon their persons as sacred and inviolable.\nThe first and the last days of the month, and of the year, are religious festivals. They measure\ntheir months by the course of the moon, and their years by the course of the sun. The first days are called\nin their language the Newdays, and the last the Oldays; which answers in our language to the first and last\nholidays of the time in question. They have magnificent churches, that are not only nobly built, but\nextremely spacious; which is the more necessary, as they have so few of them; they are a little dark\nwithin, which proceeds not from any error in the architecture, but is done with design; for their priests\nthink that too much light dissipates the thoughts, and that a more moderate degree of it both recollects the\nmind and raises devotion. Though there are many different forms of religion among them, yet all these,\nhow various soever, agree in the main point, which is the worshiping of the Divine Essence; and therefore\nthere is nothing to be seen or heard in their temples in which the several persuasions among them may not\nagree; for every sect performs those rites that are peculiar to it, in their private houses, nor is there\n\nanything in the public worship that contradicts the particular ways of those different sects. There are no\nimages for God in their temples, so that everyone may represent Him to his thoughts, according to the\nway of one=s religion; nor do they call this sole God by any other name than that of Mithra, which is their\ncommon name for the Divine Essence, whatsoever they think it to be; nor are there any prayers among\nthem but such as every one of them may use without prejudice in the churches of any other sect.\nThey fast on Oldays and go to church in the evening, thanking God for their success during the\npast year or month; and the following Newday they meet early in their churches to pray for the year or\nmonth to come. Before church on Turndays, both wives and children kneel before their husbands or\nparents, and confess their sins of omission and commission and beg pardon for them. Thus all little\ngrudges in families are removed, and they may offer up their devotions with a pure and serene mind; for\nthey hold it a great impiety to enter upon them with disturbed thoughts, or with a consciousness of their\nbearing hatred or anger in their hearts to any person whatsoever; and think that they should become liable\nto severe punishments if they presumed to offer sacrifices without cleansing their hearts and reconciling\nall their differences. In the temples, the two sexes are separated, the men go to the right hand, and the\nwomen to the left; and the males and females all place themselves before the head and master or mistress\nof that family to which they belong; so that those who have the government of them at home may see\ntheir deportment in public; but the younger are mixed in with the older, for if the younger all sat together,\nthey might perhaps trifle away the time which they ought to spend in religious aweBthe greatest and\nalmost the only incitement to virtue.\nThey offer up no living creature in sacrifice, nor do they think it suitable to the Divine Being,\nfrom whose bounty it is that these creatures have derived their lives, to take pleasure in their deaths, or the\noffering up of their blood. They burn incense and other sweet odors, and have a great number of wax\nlights during their worship; not out of any imagination that such oblations can add anything to the divine\nnature, which even prayers cannot do; but as it is a harmless and pure way of worshiping God, so they\nthink those sweet savors and lights, together with some other ceremonies, by a secret and unaccountable\nvirtue, elevate men=s souls, and inflame them with greater energy and cheerfulness during the divine\nworship.\nAll the people appear in the temples in white garments, but the priest=s vestments are\nparti-colored, and both the work and colors are wonderful. They are made of no rich materials, for they\nare neither embroidered nor set with precious stones, but are composed of the plumes of several birds,\nlaid together with so much art and so neatly, that the true value of them is far beyond the costliest\nmaterials. They say that in the ordering and placing those plumes some dark mysteries are represented,\nwhich pass down among their priests in a secret tradition concerning them; and that they are as\nhieroglyphics, putting them in mind of the blessings that they have received from God, and of their duties\nboth to Him and to their neighbors. As soon as the priest appears in those ornaments, they all fall prostrate\non the ground, with so much reverence and so deep a silence that such as look on cannot but be struck\nwith it, as if it were the effect of the appearance of a deity. After they have been for some time in this\nposture, they all stand up, upon a sign given by the priest, and sing hymns to the honor of God, some\nmusical instruments playing all the while. These are quite of another form than those used among us: but\nas many of them are much sweeter than ours, so others are made use of by us. Yet in one thing they very\nmuch exceed us; all their music, both vocal and instrumental, is adapted to imitate and express the\npassions, and is so happily suited to every occasion, that whether the subject of the hymn be cheerful or\ntroubling, or to express grief or remorse, the music exactly represents the appropriate emotion and works\nit deep into the hearts of the congregation.\nWhen this is done, both priests and people offer up very solemn prayers to God in a set form of\nwords; and these are so composed, that whatsoever is pronounced by the whole assembly may be likewise\napplied by every man in particular to his own condition. In these prayers, they acknowledge God to be\n\nthe author and governor of the world, and the fountain of all the good they receive, and offer up their\nthanksgiving; they bless Him for His goodness in ordering it so that they are born under the happiest\ngovernment in the world, and are of a religion which they hope is the truest of all others: but if they are\nmistaken, and if there is either a better government or a religion more acceptable to God, they implore His\ngoodness to let them know it, vowing that they resolve to follow Him whithersoever He leads them. But if\ntheir government is the best and their religion is the truest, then they pray that He may strengthen them in\nit, and bring all the world to the same rules of life and to the same opinions concerning Himself; unless,\naccording to the unsearchableness of His mind, He is pleased with a variety of religions. Then they pray\nthat God may give them an easy passage at last to Himself; not presuming to set limits to Him how early\nor late it should be; but if it may be wished for, without derogating from His supreme authority, they\ndesire to be quickly delivered, and to be taken to Himself, though by the most terrible kind of death,\nrather than to be detained longer from seeing Him by the most prosperous course of life. When this prayer\nis ended, they all fall down again upon the ground, and after a little while they rise up, go home to dinner,\nand spend the rest of the day in recreation or military training.\nWell, there you areCI have described to you, as accurately as I could, the make-up of the\ncommonwealth, which I do not only think the best in the world but indeed the only commonwealth that\ntruly deserves that name. In all other places it is visible, that while people talk of a commonwealth, every\nman only seeks his own wealth; but there, where no man has any property, all men zealously pursue the\ngood of the public: and, indeed, it is no wonder to see men act so differently; for in other commonwealths,\nevery man knows that unless he provides for himself, how flourishing soever the commonwealth may be,\nhe must die of hunger; so that he sees the necessity of preferring his own concerns to the public; but in\nUtopia, where every man has a right to everything, they all know that if care is taken to keep the public\nstores full, no private man can want anything; for among them there is no unequal distribution, so that no\nman is poor, none in necessity; and though no man has anything, yet they are all rich; for what can make a\nman so rich as to lead a serene and cheerful life, free from anxieties, neither wanting things himself nor\nvexed with the endless complaints of his wife? He is not afraid of the poverty of his son or worrying\nabout the dowry of his daughter, but is secure in this, that both he and his wife, his children and\ngrandchildren, to as many generations as he can fancy, will all live both plentifully and happily; since\namong them there is no less care taken of those who were once engaged in labor, but grow afterward\nunable to follow it, than there is elsewhere of these that continue still employed.\nI would gladly hear any man compare the justice that is among them with that of all other nations;\namong whom, may I perish if I see anything that looks either like justice or equity. For what justice is\nthere in this, that a nobleman, a goldsmith, a banker, or any other man, that either does nothing at all, or at\nbest is employed in things that are of no use to the public, should live in great luxury and splendor upon\nwhat is so ill acquired; but laborers, carters, blacksmiths, and ploughmen, who work harder even than the\nbeasts themselves and work at things so necessary that no commonwealth could hold out a year without\nthem, can only earn so poor a livelihood and must lead so miserable a life, that the condition of the beasts\nis much better than theirs? The beasts do not work so constantly but feed almost as well, and with more\npleasure, too, because they have no anxiety about what is to come, while these men are depressed by a\nbarren and fruitless employment, and tormented with the apprehensions of want in their old age, since\nwhat they get barely maintain them and is consumed as fast as it comes in, there is no overplus left to lay\nup for old age. Is not that government both unjust and ungrateful, that is so prodigal of its favors to those\nthat are called gentlemen, or goldsmiths, or such others who are idle, or live either by flattery, or by\ncontriving the arts of vain pleasure; and on the other hand, takes no care of those of a meaner sort, such as\nploughmen, colliers, and smiths, without whom it could not subsist? But after the public has reaped all the\nadvantage of their service, and they come to be oppressed with age, sickness, and want, all their labors\nand the good they have done is forgotten; and all the recompense given them is that they are left to die in\ngreat misery. The richer sort are often trying to bring the wages of laborers lower, not only by fraudulent\npractices but also by bribing laws into existence for the purpose. As if it weren=t bad enough to give\n\nsuch small rewards to those who deserve so well of the public, yet they must give these hardships the\nname and color of justice, by procuring laws to be made for regulating them!\nI must say that, as I hope for mercy, I can have no other notion of all the other governments that I\nsee or know than that they are a conspiracy of the rich to advance their interest on a pretense of managing\nsociety. They devise all the trickery they can first, to preserve all that they have so ill acquired without\ndanger, and second to engage the poor to toil and labor for them on the cheap, and oppress them as much\nas they please. And if they can but prevail to get these contrivances established by public authority, which\nis considered as representing the whole people, they are accounted laws. These wicked men have, by\ninsatiable greed, divided among themselves what could supply the needs of the whole society. And yet,\nhow far are they from the happiness enjoyed by the Utopians! For the use as well as the desire of money\nbeing extinguished, much anxiety and great occasions of mischief is cut off with it. And who does not see\nthat the frauds, thefts, robberies, quarrels, tumults, contentions, seditions, murders, treacheries, and\npoisonings, which are indeed punished but not inhibited by the severities of law, would all fall off, if\nmoney were no longer valued by the world? Men=s fears, solicitudes, cares, labors, and watchings, would\nall perish in the same moment with the value of money: even poverty itself, for the relief of which money\nseems most necessary, would fall. But, in order to the apprehending this aright, take one instance.\nConsider any year that has been so unfruitful that many thousands have died of hunger. I=d wager that if\na survey was made of the granaries of all the rich men at the end of that year, you would have found\nenough hoarded up grain to have prevented all that consumption of men who perished in misery; and that\nif it had been distributed among them, none would have felt the terrible effects of that scarcity; so easy a\nthing would it be to supply all the necessities of life, if that blessed thing called money, which is supposed\nto exist for procuring them, was not really the only thing that obstructed their being procured!\nI do not doubt but rich men are sensible of this, and that they well know how much a greater\nhappiness it is to want nothing necessary than to abound in things that you don=t need and to be rescued\nout of so much misery than to crouch behind a barricade of wealth; and I cannot think but the sense of\nevery man=s interest, added to the authority of Christ, who knew what was best for us in his wisdom and\nwas too good to enjoin us to anything else, would have drawn all the world over to the laws of the\nUtopians, if it weren=t for pride, that plague of human nature, that source of so much misery. For pride\ndoes not measure happiness by what you have as by what others have not; and would not be happy in\nparadise, if there were no poor there to gloat over, no miserable people there to deride with their\nunhappiness. Pride thinks its own happiness shines the brighter by comparing it with the misfortunes of\nother persons, and takes its pleasure that by displaying its own wealth, they may feel their poverty the\nmore sensibly. This is that infernal serpent that creeps through human hearts, that monstrous sucking-fish\nthat clings to the ship of state, drawing it always backwards, away from a better life.\nAnd since Pride is so deeply rooted in mankind=s heart that she cannot easily be torn out, I am\nglad that at least one country has fallen upon a way of life that I=d like to see the whole world imitate; for\nthey have indeed laid down a scheme and policy, that as men live happily under it, so it is like to be of\ngreat continuance. They having rooted out of the minds of their people all the seeds of ambition and\npartisan interest, so that there is no danger of internal conflict; which alone has been the ruin of many\nStates that seemed otherwise to be well secured. And as long as they live in peace at home, and are\ngoverned by such good laws, the envy of all their neighboring kings, who have often though in vain\nattempted their ruin, will never be able to put Utopia into commotion or disorder.\n\nWhen Raphael had made an end of speaking, many things occurred to me concerning the\nmanners and laws of that people. Their way of making war seemed quite absurd, as well as their\nnotions of religion and divine matters; together with several other particulars. But chiefly what\nseemed ridiculous was the foundation of all the rest, that is, their system of holding property in\ncommon and living without the use of money, by which all nobility, magnificence, splendor, and\nmajesty, which are generally supposed to be the true glories of a nation, would be quite taken\naway. Yet since I saw that Raphael was weary, and was not sure whether he could easily bear\ncontradiction, . . . I only made polite remarks about their system and the account he had given of\nit; and so taking him by the hand, led him to supper, and told him I would find out some other\ntime for examining this subject more carefully; and indeed I shall be glad to embrace an\nopportunity of doing it. In the meanwhile, though I must admit that he is both a very learned\nman, and a person who has obtained a great knowledge of the world, I cannot perfectly agree to\neverything he has related.\nHowever, there are many things in the Commonwealth of Utopia that I rather wish, than\nhope, to see followed in our governments.\nTHE END"

Text: Original translation in the public domain.\nTHE ESSAYS OF MONTAIGNE\nAdapted from the Cotton translation by A.C. Kibel\nOF CANNIBALS.\nWhen King Pyrrhus invaded Italy, having viewed and considered the order of the army the\nRomans sent out to meet him: AI know not,@ said he, Awhat barbarians these are@ (for so the Greeks\ncalled all other nations), Abut the disposition of thearmy that I see has nothing of barbarism in it.@ The\nGreeks said as much about the troops which Flaminius brought into their country; and Philip, beholding\nfrom an eminence the order and distribution of the Roman camp formed in his kingdom by Publius\nSulpicius Galba, spoke to the same effect. By which it appears how cautious men ought to be of taking\nthings upon trust from vulgar opinion, and that we are to judge by the eye of reason and not from\ncommon report.\nI long had a man in my house that lived ten or twelve years in the New World, discovered in\nthese latter days, and in that part of it where Villegaignon landed, which he called Antarctic France\n[Brazil]. This discovery of so vast a country seems to be of very great consideration. I cannot be sure\nthat hereafter there may not be another, since so many wiser men than we having been deceived in this\none. I am afraid our eyes are bigger than our bellies and that we have more curiosity than capacity; for\nwe grasp at all, but catch nothing but wind.\nPlato brings in Solon, telling a story that be had heard from the priests of Sais in Egypt, that of\nold, and before the Deluge, there was a great island called Atlantis, situated directly at the mouth of the\nStraits of Gibraltar, which contained more countries than both Africa and Asia put together; and that the\nkings of that country, who not only possessed that isle but extended their dominion so far into the\ncontinent that they possessed Africa as far as Egypt, and extended their rule in Europe to Tuscany,\nattempted to encroach even upon Asia, and to subjugate all the nations that border upon the\nMediterranean Sea, as far as the Black Sea; and to that effect overran all Spain, the Gauls, and Italy, so\nfar as to penetrate into Greece, where the Athenians stopped them: but that sometime after, both the\nAthenians, and they and their island, were swallowed by the Flood.\nIt is very likely that this extreme irruption and inundation of water made wonderful changes and\nalterations in the habitations of the earth, as =tis said that the sea then divided Sicily from Italy (as Virgil\ntells), Cyprus from Syria, the isle of Negroponte [Cyprus] from the continent of Boeotia, and elsewhere\nunited lands that were separate before, by filling up the channel between them with sand and mud. But\nthere is no great appearance that this isle was this New World so lately discovered: for that almost\ntouched upon Spain, and it were an incredible effect of an inundation, to have pushed back so prodigious\na mass as far as twelve hundred leagues: besides that our modern navigators have already almost\ndiscovered it to be no island a mainland connected with the East Indies on the one side, and with the lands\nunder the two poles on the other side; or, if it be separate from them, it is by so narrow a strait and\n\nchannel, that it no more deserves the name of an island for that.\nIt should seem that in these great bodies of land there are two sorts of motions, the one natural,\nand the other feverish, as there are in ours. When I consider the impression that our river of Dordogne\nhas made in my time, on the right bank of its descent and that in twenty years it has gained so much and\nundermined the foundations of so many houses, I perceive it to be an extraordinary agitation: for had it\nalways followed this course, or were hereafter to do it, the aspect of the world would be totally changed.\nBut rivers alter their course, sometimes beating against the one side, and sometimes the other, and\nsometimes quietly keeping the channel. I do not speak of sudden inundations, the causes of which\neverybody understands. In Medoc, by the seashore, the Sieur d=Arsac, my brother, sees an estate he had\nthere, buried under the sands which the sea vomits before it: where the tops of some houses are yet to be\nseen, and where his rents and domains are converted into pitiful barren pasturage. The inhabitants of this\nplace affirm, that of late years the sea has driven so vehemently upon them, that they have lost above four\nleagues of land. These sands are her harbingers: and we now see great heaps of moving sand, that march\nhalf a league before her, and occupy the land.\nThe other testimony from antiquity, to which some would apply this discovery of the New World,\nis in Aristotle; at least, if that little book of unheard-of miracles be his. He there tells us, that certain\nCarthaginians, having crossed the Atlantic Sea without the Straits of Gibraltar, and sailed a very long\ntime, discovered at last a great and fruitful island, all covered over with wood, and watered with several\nbroad and deep rivers; far remote from all terra-firma, and that they, and others after them, allured by the\ngoodness and fertility of the soil, went thither with their wives and children, and began to plant a colony.\nBut the senate of Carthage perceiving their people by little and little to diminish, issued out an express\nprohibition, that upon pain of death none should transport themselves thither; and also drove out these\nnew inhabitants; fearing, =tis said, lest in process of time they should so multiply as to supplant Carthage\nitself and ruin its state. But this relation of Aristotle no more agrees with our new-found lands than the\nother.\nThe man that I had in my house (as I said) was a plain, ignorant fellow and therefore the more\nlikely to tell truth: for your better bred sort of men are much more curious in their observation,=tis true,\nand discover a great deal more, but then they interpet upon it, and to give the greater weight to what they\ndeliver and allure your belief, they cannot forbear a little to alter the story; they never represent things to\nyou simply as they are, but rather as they appeared to them, or as they would have them appear to you,\nand to gain the reputation of men of judgment, and the better to induce your faith, are willing to help out\nthe business with something more than is really true, of their own invention. Far better in such a case, to\nhave have a man either of irreproachable veracity or so simple that he has not wherewithal to contrive,\nand to give a color of truth to false relations, and who can have no ends in forging an untruth. Such a one\nwas mine; and besides, he has at different times brought to me several seamen and merchants who at the\nsame time went the same voyage. I shall therefore content myself with his information, without inquiring\nwhat the cosmographers say to the business.\nWe should have topographers to trace out to us the particular places where they have been; but\nfor having had this advantage over us, to have seen the Holy Land, they would have the privilege,\nforsooth, to tell us stories of all the other parts of the world besides. I would have every one write what\nhe knows, and as much as he knows, but no more; and that not in this only, but in all other subjects; for\nsuch a person may have some particular knowledge and experience of the nature of such a river, or such a\nfountain, who, as to other things, knows no more than what everybody does, and yet to put this little\npittance of his into circulation, he will undertake to write the whole body of physics: a vice from which\ngreat inconveniences derive their origin.\nNow, to return to my subject, I find that there is nothing barbarous and savage in that nation, by\n\nanything that I can gather, excepting, that every one gives the title of barbarism to everything that is not in\nuse in his own country. As, indeed, we have no other level of truth and reason than the example and idea\nof the opinions and customs of the place wherein we live, there is always the perfect religion, there the\nperfect government, there the most exact and accomplished usage of all things. They are savages at the\nsame rate that we say fruit are wild, which nature produces of herself and by her own ordinary progress;\nwhereas in truth, we ought rather to call those wild, whose natures we have changed by our artifice, and\ndiverted from the common order. In the former, the genuine, most useful and natural virtues and\nproperties are vigorous and sprightly, which we have helped to degenerate in these, by accommodating\nthem to the pleasure of our own corrupted palate. And yet for all this our taste confesses a flavor and\ndelicacy, excellent even to emulation of the best of ours, in several fruits wherein those countries abound\nwithout art or culture. Neither is it reasonable that art should gain the pre-eminence of our great and\npowerful mother nature. We have so surcharged her with the additional ornaments and graces we have\nadded to the beauty and riches of her own works that we have almost smothered her; yet in other places,\nwhere she shines in her own purity and proper luster, she marvelously baffles and disgraces all our vain\nand frivolous attempts.\nIvy comes readier without our care;\nIn lonely caves the arbutus growns fair;\nNo art with artless birdsong can compare\nPropertius\nOur utmost endeavors cannot arrive at so much as to imitate the nest of the least of birds, its contexture,\nbeauty, and convenience: not so much as the web of a poor spider. All things, says Plato, are produced\neither by nature, by fortune, or by art; the greatest and most beautiful by the one or the other of the\nformer, the least and the most imperfect by the last.\nThese nations then seem to me to be so far barbarous, as having received but very little form and\nfashion from art and human invention, and consequently to be not much remote from their original\nsimplicity. The laws of nature govern them still, not as yet much vitiated with any mixture of ours: but\n=tis in such purity, that I am sometimes troubled we were not sooner acquainted with these people and\nthat they were not discovered in those better times, when there were men much more able to judge of\nthem than we are.\nI am sorry that Lycurgus and Plato had no knowledge of them:\nfor to my\napprehension, what we now see in those nations, does not only surpass all the pictures with which the\npoets have adorned the golden age, and all their inventions in feigning a happy state of man, but,\nmoreover, the fancy and even the wish and desire of philosophy itself.\nSo native and so pure a\nsimplicity, as we by experience see to be in them, could never enter into their imagination, nor could they\never believe that human society could have been maintained with so little artifice and human patchwork.\nI should tell Plato, that it is a nation wherein there is no sort of traffic, no knowledge of letters, no science\nof numbers, no name of magistrate or political superiority; no use of service, no riches or poverty, no\ncontracts, no successions, no dividing of land, no properties, no occupations but those of leisure, no\nrespect of kindred but all in common, no clothing, no agriculture, no metal, no use of wheat or wine; the\nvery words that signify lying, treachery, dissimulation, avarice, envy, detraction, pardon, never heard of.\nHow much would he find his imaginary republic short of his perfection? [AMen sprung fresh from the\ngods@--Seneca]\nThese manners nature first ordained\nVirgil\nAs to the rest, they live in a country very pleasant and temperate, so that, as my witnesses inform\nme,=tis rare to hear of a sick person, and they moreover assure me that they never saw any of the natives\nparalytic, blear-eyed, toothless, or crooked with age. The situation of their country is along the seashore,\n\nenclosed on the other side toward the land, with great and high mountains, having about a hundred\nleagues in breadth between. They have great store of fish and flesh that have no resemblance to those of\nours: which they eat without any other cookery, than plain boiling, roasting and broiling. The first man\nthat rode a horse there, though in several other voyages he had dealings with them, put them into so\nterrible a fright with his centaur appearance, that they killed him with their arrows before they could come\nnear to discover who he was. Their buildings are very long, and of capacity to hold two or three hundred\npeople, made of the barks of tall trees, reared with one end upon the ground, and leaning to and\nsupporting one another, at the top, like some of our barns, of which the coverings hang down to the very\nground and serves for the side walls. They have wood so hard, that they cut with it, and make their\nswords of it, and their grills of it to broil their meat. Their beds are of cotton, hung swinging from the\nroof, like our easman=s hammocks, every man his own, for the wives lie apart from their husbands. They\nrise with the sun, and so soon as they are up, eat for all day, for they have no more meals but that: they do\nnot then drink, as Suidas reports of some other people of the East that never drank at their meals; but\ndrink very often all day after, and sometimes to a rousing pitch. Their drink is made of a certain root, and\nis of the color of our claret, and they never drink it but lukewarm. It will not keep above two or three\ndays; it has a somewhat sharp, brisk taste, is nothing heady, but very comfortable to the stomach;\nlaxative to strangers, but a very pleasant beverage to such as are accustomed to it. They make use, instead\nof bread, of a certain white compound, like Coriander lozenges; I have tasted of it; the taste is sweet and\na little flat.\nThe whole day is spent in dancing. Their young men go a-hunting after wild beasts with bows\nand arrows; one part of their women are employed in preparing their drink the while, which is their chief\nemployment. One of their old men, in the morning before they fall to eating, preaches to the whole\nfamily, walking from the one end of the house to the other, and several times repeating the same sentence,\ntill he has finished the round, for their houses are at least a hundred yards long. Valor toward their\nenemies and love toward their wives, are the two heads of his discourse, never failing in the close, to put\nthem in mind that =tis their wives who provide them their drink warm and well seasoned. The fashion of\ntheir beds, ropes, swords, and of the wooden bracelets they tie about their wrists, when they go to fight,\nand of the great canes, bored hollow at one end, by the sound of which they keep the cadence of their\ndances, are to be seen in several places, and among others, at my house. They shave all over, and much\nmore neatly than we, without other razor than one of wood or stone. They believe in the immortality of\nthe soul and that those who have merited well of the gods are lodged in that part of heaven where the sun\nrises, and the damned in the west.\nThey have I know not what kind of priests and prophets, who very rarely present themselves to\nthe people, having their abode in the mountains. At their arrival, there is a great feast, and solemn\nassembly of many villages: each house, as I have described, makes a village, and they are about a French\nleague distant from one another. This prophet declaims to them in public, exhorting them to virtue and\ntheir duty: but all their ethics are comprised in these two articles, resolution in war and affection to their\nwives. He also prophesies to them events to come, and the issues they are to expect from their\nenterprises, and prompts them to or diverts them from war: but let him look to=t; for if he fail in his\ndivination, and anything happen otherwise than he has foretold, he is cut into a thousand pieces, if he be\ncaught, and condemned for a false prophet: for that reason, if any of them has been mistaken, he is no\nmore heard of. Divination is a gift of God, and therefore to abuse it ought to be a punishable imposture.\nAmong the Scythians, where their diviners failed in the promised effect, they were laid, bound hand and\nfoot, upon carts loaded with furze and bavins, and drawn by oxen, on which they were burned to death.\nSuch as only meddle with things subject to the conduct of human capacity are excusable in doing the best\nthey can: but those other fellows that come to delude us with assurances of an extraordinary faculty,\nbeyond our understanding, ought they not to be punished, when they do not make good the effect of their\npromise and for the boldness of their imposture?\n\nThey have continual war with the nations that live further within the mainland, beyond their\nmountains, to which they go naked, and without other arms than their bows and wooden swords,\nfashioned at one end like the heads of our javelins. The obstinacy of their battles is wonderful, and they\nnever end without great effusion of blood: for as to running away, they know not what it is. Every one\nfor a trophy brings home the head of an enemy he has killed, which he fixes over the door of his house.\nAfter having a long time treated their prisoners very well, and given them all the hospitality they can\nthink of, he to whom the prisoner belongs invites a great assembly of his friends. They being come, he\nties a rope to one of the arms of the prisoner, of which, at a distance, out of his reach, he holds the one end\nhimself, and gives to the friend he loves best the other arm to hold after the same manner; which being\ndone, they two, in the presence of all the assembly, despatch the captive with their swords. After that\nthey roast him, eat him among them, and send some chops to their absent friends. They do not do this, as\nsome think, for nourishment, as the Scythians anciently did, but as a representation of an extreme\nrevenge; as will appear by this: that having observed the Portuguese, who were in league with their\nenemies, to inflict another sort of death upon any of them they took prisoners, which was to set them up\nto the girdle in the earth, to shoot at the remaining part till it was stuck full of arrows, and then to hang\nthem, they thought those people of the other world (as being men who had sown the knowledge of a great\nmany vices among their neighbors, and who were much greater masters in all sorts of mischief than they)\ndid not exercise this sort of revenge without a meaning, and that it must needs be more painful than theirs,\nthey began to leave their old way, and to follow this. I am not sorry that we should here take notice of the\nbarbarous horror of so cruel an action, but that, seeing so clearly into their faults, we should be so blind to\nour own. I conceive there is more barbarity in eating a man alive, than when he is dead; in tearing a body\nthat is yet in perfect sense limb from limb by racks and torments; in roasting it by degrees; in causing it\nto be bitten and worried by dogs and swine (as we have not only read, but lately seen, not among\ninveterate and mortal enemies, but among neighbors and fellow-citizens, and, which is worse, under color\nof piety and religion), than to roast and eat him after he is dead.\nChrysippus and Zeno, the two heads of the Stoic sect, were of opinion that there was no hurt in\nmaking use of our dead carcasses, in what way soever for our necessity, and in feeding upon them too; as\nour own ancestors, who being besieged by Caesar in the city of Alexia, resolved to sustain the famine of\nthe siege with the bodies of their old men, women, and other persons who were incapable of bearing\narms.\nThe Gascons once,=tis said, their life renewed\nBy eating of such food.\nJuvenal\nAnd physicians make no bones of employing human flesh in all sorts of ways, either outwardly or by\ngiving it inwardly for the health of the patient. But there never was any opinion so irregular, as to excuse\ntreachery, disloyalty, tyranny, and cruelty, which are our familiar vices.\nWe may then call these people barbarous, in respect to the rules of reason: but not in respect to\nourselves, who in all sorts of barbarity exceed them. Their wars are throughout noble and generous, and\ncarry as much excuse and fair pretense, as that human malady is capable of; having with them no other\nfoundation than the sole jealousy of valor. Their disputes are not for the conquest of new lands, for these\nthey already possess are so fruitful by nature, as to supply them without labor or concern with all things\nnecessary and in such abundance that they have no need to enlarge their borders. And they are moreover,\nhappy in this, that they only covet so much as their natural necessities require: all beyond that, is\nsuperfluous to them.\nMen of the same age call one another generally brothers, those who are younger, children; and\nthe old men are fathers to all. These leave to their heirs in common the full possession of goods, without\n\nany manner of division, or other title than what nature bestows upon her creatures, in bringing them into\nthe world. If their neighbors pass over the mountains to assault them and obtain a victory, all the victors\ngain by it is glory only, and the advantage of having proved themselves the better in valor and virtue: for\nthey never meddle with the goods of the conquered, but presently return into their own country, where\nthey have no want of anything necessary, nor lack of this greatest of all goods, to know happily how to\nenjoy their condition and to be content. And those in turn do the same; they demand of their prisoners no\nother ransom, than acknowledgment that they are overcome: but there is not one found in an age, who\nwill not rather choose to die than make such a confession, or either by word or look, recede from the\nentire grandeur of an invincible courage. There is not a man among them who had not rather be killed\nand eaten, than so much as to open his mouth to entreat he may not. They use them with all liberality and\nfreedom to the end that their lives may be so much the dearer to them; but frequently entertain them with\nmenaces of their approaching death, of the torments they are to suffer, of the preparations making in order\nto it, of the mangling their limbs, and of the feast that is to be made, where their carcass is to be the only\ndish. All which they do only to extort some fearful or submissive word from them, or to frighten them so\nas to make them run away, to obtain this advantage that they were terrified, and that their constancy was\nshaken; and indeed, if rightly taken, it is in this point only that a true victory consists.\nIt is no victory\nUnless the vanqujished admits your mastery\nClaudian\nThe Hungarians, a very warlike people, never pretend further than to reduce the enemy to their\nsubmission; for having forced this confession from them, they let them go without injury or ransom,\nexcepting, at the most, to make them engage their word never to bear arms against them again. We have\nsufficient advantages over our enemies that are borrowed and not truly our own; it is the quality of a\nporter, and no effect of virtue, to have stronger arms and legs; it is a dead and corporeal quality to stand\nin formation;=tis a turn of fortune to make our enemy stumble, or to dazzle him with the light of the\nsun;=tis a trick of science and art, and that may happen in a mean base fellow, to be a good fencer. The\nestimate and value of a man consist in the heart and in the will: there his true honor lies. Valor is\nstability, not of legs and arms, but of courage and soul; it does not lie in the goodness of our horse or our\nweapons but in our own. He that falls obstinate in his courage if he has fallen, he fights on his knees\n[Seneca], he who in danger of imminent death abates nothing of his assurance; who, dying, yet darts at\nhis enemy a fierce and disdainful look, is overcome not by us, but by fortune; he is killed, not conquered;\nthe most valiant are sometimes the most unfortunate. There are defeats more triumphant than victories.\nNever could those four fairest victories the sun ever beheld, of Salamis, Plataea, Mycale, and Sicily,\nventure to oppose all their united glories, to the single glory of the discomfiture of King Leonidas and his\nmen, at the pass of Thermopylae. Whoever ran with a more glorious desire and greater ambition to the\nwinning of a battle than Captain Iscolas to its certain loss? Who could have found out a more energetic\nway to secure his safety than he did to assure his destruction? He was set to defend a certain pass of\nPeloponnesus against the Arcadians, which, considering the nature of the place and the inequality of\nforces, he found it utterly impossible to do; and seeing that all who were presented to the enemy must\ncertainly be slain upon the field, and also judgint it unworthy of his virtue and magnanimity and of the\nLacedaemonian name to fail in any part of his duty, he chose a mean between these two extremes after\nthis manner: the youngest and most active of his men, he preserved for the service and defense of their\ncountry and sent them back; and with the rest, whose loss would be of less consideration, he resolved to\nmake good the pass, and with the death of them to make the enemy buy their entry as dear as possibly he\ncould; as it fell out, for being presently environed on all sides by the Arcadians, after having made a great\nslaughter of the enemy, he and his were all cut in pieces. Is there any trophy dedicated to the conquerors,\nwhich was not much more due to these who were overcome? The part that true conquering is to play, lies\nin the encounter, not in the coming off; and the honor of valor consists in fighting, not in subduing.\n\nBut to return to my story: these prisoners are so far from discovering the least weakness, for all\nthe terrors presented to them, that, on the contrary, during the two or three months they are kept, they\nalways appear with a cheerful countenance; beg their masters to make haste to bring them to the test,\ndefy, rail at them, and reproach them with cowardice, and the number of battles they have lost against\nthose of their country. I have a song made by one of these prisoners, wherein he bids them Acome all,\nand dine upon him, and welcome, for they shall withal eat their own fathers and grandfathers, whose flesh\nhas served to feed and nourish him. These muscles,@ says he, Athis flesh and these veins, are your own:\npoor silly souls as you are, you little think that the substance of your ancestors= limbs is here yet; notice\nwhat you eat, and you will find in it the taste of your own flesh:@ in which song there is nothing that\nrelishes of the barbarian. Those that paint these people dying after this manner represent the prisoner\nspitting in the faces of his executioners and making wry mouths at them. And >tis most certain, that to\nthe very last gasp, they never cease to brave and defy them both in word and gesture. In plain truth, these\nmen are very savage in comparison of us; of necessity, they must either be absolutely so or else we are\nsavages; for there is a vast difference between their manners and ours.\nThe men there have several wives, and so much the greater number, by how much they have the\ngreater reputation for valor. And it is one very remarkable feature in their marriages, that the same\njealousy our wives have to hinder and divert us from the friendship and familiarity of other women, those\nemploy to promote their husbands= desires, and to procure them many spouses; for being above all\nthings solicitous of their husbands= honor,=tis their chiefest care to seek out, and to bring in as many\nother wives for him they can, forasmuch as it is a testimony of the husband=s virtue. Most of our ladies\nwill cry out, that =tis monstrous; whereas in truth, it is not so; but a truly matrimonial virtue, and of the\nhighest form. In the Bible, Sarah, with Leah and Rachel, the two wives of Jacob, gave the most beautiful\nof their handmaids to their husbands; Livia preferred the passions of Augustus to her own interest; and\nthe wife of King Deiotarus, Stratonice, did not only give up a fair young maid that served her to her\nhusband=s embraces, but moreover carefully brought up the children he had by her, and assisted them in\nthe succession to their father=s crown.\n\nAnd that it may not be supposed, that all this is done by a simple and servile obligation to\ntheir common practice, or by any authoritative impression of their ancient custom, without\njudgment or reasoning and from having a soul so stupid that it cannot contrive what else to do, I\nmust here give you some touches of their sufficiency in point of understanding. Besides what I\nrepeated to you before, which was one of their songs of war, I have another, a love-song, that\nbegins thus: AStay, adder, stay, that by thy pattern my sister may draw the fashion and work of a\nrich ribbon, that I may present to my beloved, by which means thy beauty and the excellent order\nof thy scales shall forever be preferred before other serpents.@ Wherein the first couplet, AStay,\nadder,@ etc., makes the refrain of the song. Now I have conversed enough with poetry to judge\nthus much: that not only, there is nothing of barbarous in this invention, but, moreover, that it is\nperfectly Anacreontic. To which may be added, that their language is soft, of a pleasing accent,\nand something bordering upon the Greek.\nThree of these people, not foreseeing how dear their knowledge of the corruptions of this\npart of the world will one day cost their happiness and repose and that the effect of this commerce\nwill be their ruin, as I presuppose it is begun (miserable men, to suffer themselves to be deluded\nwith desire of novelty and to have left the serenity of their own heaven, to come so far to gaze at\nours!) were at Rouen at the time that the late King Charles IX. was there. The king himself\ntalked to them a good while, and they were made to see our fashions, our pomp, and the form of a\ngreat city. After which, some one asked their opinion and would know of them, what of all the\nthings they had seen they found most to be admired? To which they made answer, three things,\nof which I have forgotten the third, and am troubled at it, but two I yet remember. They said, that\nin the first place they thought it very strange, that so many tall men wearing beards, strong, and\nwell armed, who were about the king (=tis like they meant the Swiss of his guard) should submit\nto obey a child, and that they did not rather choose out one among themselves to command.\nSecondly (they have a way of speaking in their language, to call men the half of one another), that\nthey had observed, that there were among us men full and crammed with all manner of\ncommodities, while, in the meantime, their halves were begging at their doors, lean, and\nhalf-starved with hunger and poverty; and they thought it strange that these necessitous halves\nwere able to suffer so great an inequality and injustice, and that they did not take the others by the\nthroats, or set fire to their houses.\nI talked to one of them a great while together, but I had so ill an interpreter and one who\nwas so perplexed by his own stupidity to apprehend my meaning that I could get little out of the\nman I was trying to question. Asking him what advantage he reaped from the superiority he had\namong his own people (for he was a captain, and our sailors called him king), he told me: to\nmarch at the head of them to war. Demanding of him further how many men he had to follow\nhim he showed me a space of ground, to signify as many as could march in such a compass,\nwhich might be four or five thousand men; and putting the question to him, whether or no his\nauthority expired with the war he told me that this much remained: that when he went to visit the\nvillages dependent on him, they made him paths through the thick of their woods by which he\nmight pass at his ease. All this does not sound very badCbut who cares? They don=t wear pants."

Text: Original translation in the public domain.\nTHE ESSAYS OF MONTAIGNE\nAdapted from the Cotton translation by A.C. Kibel\nLecture #3 - Of Repentance\nOthers form man; I recount him and portray a particular one, very ill-formed, and whom I should\ncertainly make very different from what he is if I had to model him anew: but that=s past recalling.\nNow, though the features of my picture alter and change,it is not, however, unlike: the world eternally\nturns round; all things therein are incessantly moving, the earth, the rocks of Caucasus, and the pyramids\nof Egypt, both with the common motion and their own. Stability itself is no other but a slower and more\nlanguishing motion. I cannot fix my object; it is always tottering and reeling by a natural giddiness. I\ntake it in this condition just as it is at the moment I am considering it. I do not paint its being, I paint its\npassage; not a passing from one age to another, or, as people say, from seven to seven years, but from\nday to day, from minute to minute. I must accommodate my history to the moment: I may presently\nchange, not only by fortune, but also by intention. it is a record of various and changeable accidents, of\nirresolute imaginations, and sometimes contrary ideas: whether it be that I am then another self or that I\ngrasp a subject in other circumstances and see it from a different viewpoint: so it may be that I contradict\nmyself, but, as Demades said, I never contradict the truth. Could my mind take firm footing, I would not\nessay but decide: but it is always apprenticeship and on trial.\nI set forth a life ordinary and without luster: it is all one. All moral philosophy may as well be\napplied to a common and private life, as to one of richer composition: every man carries the entire form\nof human condition. Authors communicate themselves to the people by some especial and extrinsic\nmark; I, the first of any, by my entire being; as Michel de Montaigne, not as a grammarian, a poet, or a\nlawyer. If the world find fault that I speak too much of myself, I find fault that it do not so much as think\nof itself. But is it reasonable, that being so retired in my private life, I should aspire to recommend myself\nto the knowledge of the public? And is it also reasonable that I should produce to the world, where\nartfulness and practices have so much credit and authority, some crude and simple products of nature and\nof a weak nature to boot? Is it not to build a wall without stone or brick, or some such thing, to write\nbooks without learning and without art? The motifs of music are conducted by art; mine by chance. I\nhave this, at least, according to the rules, that never any man treated of a subject he better understood and\nknew, than I what I have undertaken, and that in this I am the most learned man alive: next, that never\nany man penetrated farther into his matter, nor better and more distinctly sifted the parts and sequences of\nit, nor ever more exactly and fully arrived at the end he proposed to himself. To perfect it, I need bring\nnothing but fidelity to the work; and that is there, and the most pure and sincere that is anywhere to be\nfound. I speak truth, not so much as I would, but as much as I dare; and I dare a little the more, as I grow\nolder; for, methinks, custom allows to age more liberty of prating, and more indiscretion of talking of\noneself. That cannot fall out here, which I often see elsewhere, that the work and the artificer contradict\n\none another: ACan a man of such interesting conversation have written sukch a stupid book?@ Or AHow\nhave such learned writings proceeded from a man of such feeble conversation?@ He who talks at a very\nordinary rate and writes rare matter, it is to say that his capacity is borrowed and not his own. A learned\nman is not learned in all things but an accomplished man is accomplished in general, and is accomplished\nin ignorance as well; here my book and I go hand in hand together. Elsewhere men may commend or\ncensure the work, without reference to the workman; here they cannot: who touches the one, touches the\nother. He who shall judge of it without knowing it will more wrong himself than me; he who comes to\nknow it gives me all the satisfaction I desire. I shall be happy beyond my desert, if I can obtain only thus\nmuch from the public approval, as to make men of understanding perceive that I was capable of profiting\nfrom learning, if I had had any; and that I deserved to have been assisted by a better memory.\nLet me here excuse what I often repeat, that I very rarely repent, and that my conscience is\nsatisfied with itself, not as the conscience of an angel, or that of a horse, but as the conscience of a man,\nalways adding this clause, not in ceremony, but in true and real modesty, that I speak as an ignorant\ninquirer, purely and simply referring myself to the common and accepted beliefs for doctrine. I do not\nteach, I only relate.\nThere is no vice that is absolutely a vice which does not offend, and that a sound judgment does\nnot accuse; for there is in it so manifest a deformity and inconvenience, that perhaps they are in the right\nwho say that it is chiefly begotten by stupidity and ignorance, so hard is it to imagine that a man can\nknow it without hating it. Malice sucks up the greatest part of its own venom, and poisons itself. Vice\nleaves repentance in the soul, like an ulcer in the flesh, which is always scratching and lacerating itself;\nfor reason effaces all other grief and sorrows, but it begets that of repentance, which is so much the more\ngrievous, because it springs within, as the cold and heat of fevers are more sharp than those that only\nstrike upon the outward skin. I hold for vices (but each one according to its measure) not only those\nwhich reason and nature condemn but also those which the opinion of men, though false and erroneous,\nhave made such, if authorized by law and custom.\nThere is likewise no virtue which does not gladden a well-born nature; there is a kind of, I know\nnot what, congratulation in well doing that gives us an inward satisfaction, and a generous boldness that\naccompanies a good conscience: a soul daringly vicious may, peradventure, arm itself with security, but\nit cannot supply itself with this complacency and satisfaction. it is no little satisfaction to feel a man=s\nself preserved from the contagion of so depraved an age, and to say to himself: AWhoever could\npenetrate into my soul would not there find me guilty either of the affliction or ruin of any one, or of\nrevenge or envy, or of any offense against the public laws, or of innovation or disturbance, or of failure of\nmy word; and though the license of the time permits and teaches every one so to do, yet have I not\nplundered any Frenchman=s goods, or taken his money, and have lived upon what is my own, in war as\nwell as in peace; neither have I set any man to work without paying him his wages.@ These testimonies\nof a good conscience please, and this natural gladness is very beneficial to us, and the only payment that\nwe can never fail of.\nTo ground the recompense of virtuous actions upon the approbation of others is too uncertain and\nunsafe a foundation, especially in so corrupt and ignorant an age as this, wherein the good opinion of\npeople is a bad sign. Upon whom can you rely to see what is worthy of praise? God defend me from\nbeing an honest man, according to the descriptions of honor I daily see every one make of himself.\n[AWhat were vices are now virtuous practices.@ -- Seneca] Some of my friends have at times schooled\nand scolded me with great sincerity and plainness, either of their own voluntary motion, or by me\nentreated to it as to an office, which to a well-composed soul surpasses not only in utility, but in kindness\nall other offices of friendship: I have always received them with the most open arms, both of courtesy\nand acknowledgment; but, to say the truth, I have often found so much false measure, both in their\nreproaches and praises, that I had not done much wrong to do wrong rather than to do good according to\n\ntheir notions. We, who live private lives, not exposed to any other view than our own, ought chiefly to\nhave a settled pattern within ourselves by which to test our actions; and according to that, sometimes to\nencourage and sometimes to correct ourselves. I have my laws and my court to judge of myself, and\napply myself more to these than to anything else: I do, indeed, restrain my actions according to others;\nbut extend them not by any other rule than my own. You yourself only know if you are cowardly and\ncruel, loyal and devout: others see you not, and only guess at you by uncertain conjectures, and do not so\nmuch see your nature as your art; rely not therefore upon their opinions, but stick to your own: [AYou\nmust use your own judgment; your own conscience weighs heaviest in deciding your virtues. Take it\naway, and everything falls.--Cicero@]\nBut the saying that repentance immediately follows the sin seems not to consider sin in its robes\nof state, lodged in us as if it were master in its own habitation. One may disown and retract the vices that\nsurprise us, and to which we are hurried by passions; but those which by long habit are rooted in a strong\nand vigorous will are not subject to contradiction. Repentance is nothing but a disavowal of our will and\nan opposition to our fancies, which leads us which way it pleases. It makes this person disown his former\nvirtue and continency:\n[AWhy had I not in youth the mind I have today?\nOr why have desires now\ncome when youth has flown away?@ -- Horace]\n=Tis a rare life that maintains itself in due order in private. Every one may juggle his part, and\nrepresent an honest man upon the stage: but within, and in his own bosom, where all may do as they\nwish, where all is concealed, to be regularBthere=s the point. The next degree is to be so in his house,\nand in his ordinary actions, for which we are accountable to none, and where there is no study nor artifice.\nAnd therefore Bias, setting forth the excellent state of a private family, says: Ait is one whose master is\nthe same within, by his own virtue and temper, as he is public, for fear of the laws and report of men.@\nAnd it was a worthy saying of Julius Drusus, to the masons who offered him, for three thousand crowns,\nto put his house in such a posture that his neighbors should no longer be able to see into it as before; AI\nwill give you,@ said he, Asix thousand to make it so that everybody may see into every room.@ it is\nhonorably recorded of Agesilaus, that he used in his journeys always to take up his lodgings in temples, to\nthe end that the people and the gods themselves might pry into his most private actions. Some have been\na miracle to the world, whose wives and servants have never seen anything much remarkable; few men\nhave been admired by their own households.\nNo one was ever a prophet, not merely in his own house, but in his own country, says the\nexperience of histories: it is the same in things of no importance, and in this low example the image of a\ngreater is to be seen. In my country of Gascony, they look upon it as a joke to see me in print; the further\noff I am read from my own home, the better I am esteemed. I am driven to purchase printers in Guienne;\nelsewhere they purchase me. Upon this sort of thing people who conceal themselves present and living\nrest their hopes of obtaining a name when they are absent and dead. I had rather have less of admiration,\nand do not expose myself to the world upon any other account than my present share; when I leave the\nworld, I call it quits for the rest. See this functionary whom the people escort in state, with wonder and\napplause, to his very door; he puts off the pageant with his robe, and falls so much the lower by how\nmuch he was higher exalted: in himself within, all is tumult and degraded. And though all should be\nregular there, it will require a vivid and well-chosen judgment to perceive it in these low and private\nactions; to which may be added, that order is a dull, somber virtue. To brave enemy fire, conduct an\nembassy, govern a people, are actions of renown. To scold, laugh, sell, pay, love, hate, and gently and\njustly converse with a man=s own family, and with himself; not to indulge ourselves, not to be false to\nourselvesBthese are more rare and hard, and less noticeable.\nAll of which means that retired lives, whatever, is said to the contrary, undergo duties of as great\nor greater difficulty than public lives do; and private men, says Aristotle, serve virtue more painfully and\nhighly, than those in authority: we prepare ourselves for eminent occasions, more out of glory than\n\nconscience. The shortest way to arrive at glory, would be to do that for conscience which we do for\nglory: and the virtue of Alexander appears to me of much less vigor in his great theater, than that of\nSocrates in his mean and obscure employment. I can easily conceive Socrates in the place of Alexander,\nbut I cannot imagine Alexander in the place of Socrates.\nIf you ask the one what he can do, he will\nanswer, ASubdue the world:@ if you ask the other, he will say, ACarry on human life conformably with its\nnatural condition;@ a much more general, weighty, and legitimate knowledge than the other.\nThe virtue of the soul does not consist in flying high, but in walking at an orderly pace; its\ngreatness does not exercise itself in greatness but in mediocrity. As they who judge and try us within\nmake no great account of the luster of our public actions and see they are only streaks and rays of clear\nwater springing from a slimy and muddy bottom, so they who judge us by this gallant outward\nappearance draw inferences about our internal constitution and cannot associate ordinary faculties like\ntheir own with these outward faculties that astonish them and are so far beyond their scope.\nIn like\nmanner, we give savage forms to demons: and who does not give Tamerlane great eyebrows, wide\nnostrils, a dreadful visage, and a prodigious stature, according to the imagination he has conceived by the\nreport of his name? Had any one formerly brought me to Erasmus, I should hardly have believed that he\nspoke anything but wisdom and wise sayings to his servant or his hostess. We much more aptly imagine\na workman upon his toilet-seat or upon his wife than a great president, venerable by his bearing and\nauthority. We fancy that such as he, from their high tribunals, will not lower themselves so much as to\nlive.\nAs vicious souls are often incited by some foreign impulse to do well, so are virtuous souls to do\nill; they are therefore to be judged by their settled state, when they are at home, whenever that may be;\nand, at all events, when they are nearer repose, and in their native station. Natural inclinations are much\nassisted and fortified by education: but they are seldom overcome or changed by it. A thousand natures\nof my time have escaped through the bars of training to their inherent virtue or vice.\nSuch original\nqualities are not to be rooted out; they may be covered and concealed. The Latin tongue is as it were\nnatural to me; I understand it better than French, although I have not been used to speak it, nor hardly to\nwrite it these forty years. Yet, upon extreme and sudden emotions which I have fallen into twice or thrice\nin my life, and once, seeing my father in perfect health fall upon me in a swoon, I have always uttered my\nfirst outcries and ejaculations in Latin; nature starting up, and forcibly expressing itself, in spite of so\nlong a discontinuation; and this example is said of many others.\nThey who in my time have attempted to correct the manners of the world by new opinions,\nreform superficial vices but the essential vices they leave as they were, if indeed, they do not increase\nthem; and increase is to be feared.\nWe defer all other well-doing upon the account of these external\nreforms, of less cost and greater show, and thereby offer expiation on the cheap for the natural\nconsubstantial and internal vices. Look a little into our experience: there is no man, if he listen to\nhimself, who does not in himself discover a particular and governing pattern of his own, a ruling pattern\nthat both struggles against his education and also wrestles with the tempest of passions that oppose it. For\nmy part, I seldom find myself agitated with surprises; I always find myself in my place, as heavy and\nunwieldy bodies do. If I am not at home, I am always near at hand; my dissipations do not transport me\nvery far. There is nothing very strange nor extreme about them; and I also have sound and vigorous\nrecoveries.\nThe real condemnation that touches the common practice of men is that their everyday privacy\nitself is full of filth and corruption; the idea of their reformation blurred; their repentance almost as sick\nand faulty as their sin. Some, either from having been tied to vice by natural attachment or long practice,\ncannot see its deformity. Others (and I am one of their body) do indeed feel the weight of vice, but they\ncounterbalance it with pleasure, or some other occasion, and suffer and lend themselves to it for a certain\nprice, but viciously and basely. Yet there might, haply, be imagined so vast a disproportion of measure\nthat the pleasure itself might justly excuse the sin, as we say that utility may, but in this case without\n\ntaking the utility of its gains into accountB a case where the pleasure did not follow from sin, as money\nfrom theft, but lay in the very exercise of sin, as in the enjoyment of women, where the temptation is\nviolent, and, as it is said, sometimes not to be overcome.\nBeing the other day at Armaignac, on the estate of a kinsman of mine, I there saw a country\nfellow who was by every one nicknamed the Thief. He thus related the story of his life; that being born a\nbeggar, and finding that he should not be able, so as to be clear of poverty, to get his living by the sweat\nof his brow, he resolved to turn thief, and by means of his strength of body, had exercised this trade all the\ntime of his youth in great security; for he ever made his harvest and vintage in other men=s grounds, but\na great way off, and in so great quantities, that it was not to be imagined one man could have carried away\nso much in one night upon his shoulders; and, moreover, was careful equally to divide and distribute the\nmischief he did, that the loss was of less importance to every particular man. He is now grown old, and\nrich for a man of his condition, thanks to his trade, which he openly confesses to every one. And to make\nhis peace with God, he says, that he is daily ready by good offices to make satisfaction to the successors\nof those he has robbed, and if he do not finish (for to do it all at once he is not able) he will then leave it in\ncharge to his heirs to perform the rest, proportionably to the wrong he himself only knows he has done to\neach. By this description, true or false, this man looks upon theft as a dishonest action, and hates it, but\nless than poverty; he repents of it by itself, but to the extent he has thus recompensed, he repents not.\nThis is not that habit which incorporates us into vice, and conforms even our understanding itself to it;\nnor is it that impetuous whirlwind that by gusts troubles and blinds our souls and for the time precipitates\nus, judgment and all, into the power of vice.\nI customarily do what I do thoroughly and in a single step; I have rarely any movement that hides\nitself from my reason and that does not proceed in the matter by the consent of all my faculties, without\ndivision or internal sedition. My judgment takes all the blame or all the praise for it; and the blame it\nonce has, it has always; for almost from my infancy it has ever been one; the same inclination, the same\nturn, the same force; and as to universal opinions, I fixed myself from my childhood in the place where I\nresolved to stick. There are some sins that are impetuous, prompt, and sudden; let us set them aside; but\nas for these other sins so often repeated, deliberated, and contrived, whether sins of our make-up or sins\nof profession and vocation, I cannot conceive that they should have so long been settled in the same\nresolution, unless the reason and conscience of him who has them be constant to have them; and the\nrepentance he boasts to be inspired with on a sudden, is very hard for me to imagine or form. I follow not\nthe opinion of the Pythagorean sect, Athat men take up a new soul when they repair to the images of the\ngods to receive their oracles,@ unless he mean that it must indeed be extrinsic, new, and lent just for the\nmoment, our own showing so little sign of purification and cleanness fit for the occasion. They act quite\ncontrary to the Stoical precepts, which do indeed, command us to correct the imperfections and vices we\nknow ourselves guilty of but forbid us therefore to grieve about them and disturb the repose of our souls;\nin contrast, some men make us believe that they have great grief and remorse within; but of amendment,\ncorrection, or interruption, they make nothing appear.\nIt cannot be a cure if the malady be not wholly discharged; if repentance were laid upon the scale\nof the balance, it would weigh down sin. I find no quality so easy to counterfeit as piety, if men do not\nconform their manners and life to it. Its essence is abstruse and occult; its appearances easy and showy.\nFor my own part, I may desire in general to be other than I am; I may condemn and dislike my whole\nform, and beg of Almighty God for an entire reformation, and that He will please to pardon my natural\ninfirmity: but I ought not to call this repentance, methinks, no more, than the being dissatisfied that I am\nnot an angel or Cato. My actions are regular, and conformable with what I am, and to my condition. I\ncan do no better; and repentance does not properly touch things that are not in our power; this is the\ndomain of regret. I imagine an infinite number of natures more elevated and regular than mine; and yet I\ndo not for all that improve my faculties, no more than my arm or mind grows more strong and vigorous\nfor imagining another to be so. If just imagining and wishing a nobler way of acting than ours produced a\n\nrepentance of our own, we must then repent us of our most innocent actions, since as we may suppose\nthat in a more excellent nature they would have been carried on with greater dignity and perfection; and\nwe would that ours were so. When I compare the behavior of my youth with that of my old age, I find\nthat I have commonly behaved myself with equal order in both, according to what I understand: and this\nis all that my resistance can ever do. I do not flatter myself; in the same circumstances I should again do\nwhat I did before. It is not a patch, but rather an universal tincture, with which I am stained. I know no\nrepentance, superficial, half-way and ceremonious; it must sting me all over before I can call it so, and\nmust prick my bowels as deeply and universally as God sees into me.\nAs to business, many excellent opportunities have escaped me for want of good management;\nand yet my deliberations were sound enough, according to the occurrences presented to me: it is their\nway to choose always the easiest and safest course. I find that, in my former resolves, I have proceeded\nwith discretion, according to my own rule, and according to the state of the subject proposed, and should\ndo the same a thousand years hence in similar situations. I do say this in respect of how these things\nappear to me now (in light of how they actually turned out) but in respect of how they appeared then,\nwhen I deliberated on them: the force of all counsel consists in the time; occasions and things eternally\nshift and change. I have in my life committed some important errors, not for want of good understanding,\nbut for want of good luck. There are secret, and not to be foreseen, parts in matters we have in hand,\nespecially in the nature of men; mute conditions, that make no show, unknown sometimes even to the\npossessors themselves, that spring and start up by incidental occasions; if my prudence could not\npenetrate into nor foresee them, I blame it not: it is commissioned no further than its own limits; if the\noutcome be too hard for me, and take the side I have refused, there is no remedy; I do not blame myself, I\naccuse my fortune, and not my work; this cannot be called repentance.\nPhocion, having given the Athenians an advice that was not followed, and the affair nevertheless\nsucceeding contrary to his opinion, some one said to him; AWell, Phocion, art thou content that matters\ngo so well?@ AI am very well content,@ replied he, Athat this has happened so well, but I do not repent\nthat I counseled the other.@ When any of my friends address themselves to me for advice, I give it\ncandidly and clearly, without hesitating, as almost all other men do, at the chance that the things may fall\nout contrary to my opinion and that I may be reproached for my counsel; I am very indifferent as to that,\nfor the fault will be theirs for having consulted me, and I could not refuse them that office.\nI, for my own part, can rarely blame any one but myself for my oversights and misfortunes, for\nindeed I seldom solicit the advice of another, if not by honor of ceremony, or excepting where I stand in\nneed of information, specialized knowledge, or as to matter of fact. But in things wherein I stand in need\nof nothing but judgment, other men=s reasons may serve to fortify my own, but have little power to\ndissuade me; I hear them all with civility and patience: but to my recollection, I never made use of any\nbut my own. With me, they are but flies and atoms, that confound and distract my will. I lay no great\nstress upon my opinions; but I lay as little upon those of others, and fortune rewards me accordingly. If\nI receive but little advice, I also give but little. I am seldom consulted, and still more seldom believed,\nand know no concern, either public or private, that has been mended or bettered by my advice. Even they\nwhom fortune had in some sort tied to my direction have more willingly let themselves be directed by\nanybody=s counsels but mine. And as a man as jealous of my repose as of my authority, I am better\npleased that it should be so; in leaving me there, they humor what I profess, which is to settle and wholly\ncontain myself within myself. I take a pleasure in being uninterested in other men=s affairs, and\ndisengaged from being their warranty and responsible for what they do.\nIn all affairs that are past, be it how it will, I have very little regret; for this idea puts me out of\nmy pain, namely, that they were bound so to fall out; they are in the great revolution of the world, and in\nthe chain of stoical causes: your fancy cannot, by wish and imagination, move one tittle, but that the great\ncurrent of things will not reverse both the past and the future.\n\nAs to the rest, I abominate that incidental repentance which old age brings along with it. He, who\nsaid of old, that he was obliged to his age for having weaned him from pleasure, was of another opinion\nthan I am; I can never think myself beholden to impotency, for any good it can do to me; ANor will\nProvidence be so hostile to her work that debility will be ranked with the best things@ [Quintillian] Our\nappetites are rare in old age; a profound satiety seizes us after the act; in this I see nothing of conscience;\nchagrin and weakness imprint in us a drowsy and rheumatic virtue. We must not suffer ourselves to be so\nwholly carried away by natural alterations as to let them warp our judgments. Youth and pleasure had not\nformerly prevailed so far with me that I did not well enough discern the face of vice in pleasure; neither\ndoes the distaste that years have brought me so far prevail with me that I cannot discern pleasure in vice.\nNow that I am no more in my flourishing age, I judge as well of these things as if I were. I, who narrowly\nand strictly examine it, find my reason the very same it was in my most licentious age, except, perhaps,\nthat it is weaker and more decayed by being grown older; and I find that the pleasure it refuses me upon\nthe account of my bodily health it would no more refuse now in consideration of my spiritual health than\nit would refuse them at any time before. I do not repute it the more valiant for being less able in combat;\nmy temptations are so broken and mortified, that they are not worth its opposition; I can repel them bare-\nhanded. If my reason should have to confront my fomer lustt, I fear it would have less power to resist it\nthan heretofore; I do not discern that in itself it judges anything otherwise now, than it formerly did, nor\nthat it has acquired any new light: wherefore, if there be convalescence, it is an enchanted one.\nMiserable kind of remedy, to owe one=s health to one=s disease! it is not our misfortune that\nshould perform this office, but the good fortune of our judgment. I cannot be made to do anything by\npersecutions and afflictions but to curse them: I am not one of those who can be roused but by a whip.\nMy reason is much more free in prosperity and much more distracted by digesting pains than pleasures: I\nsee best in a clear sky; health admonishes me more cheerfully, and to better purpose, than sickness. I did\nall that in me lay to reform and regulate myself from pleasures, at a time when I had health and vigor to\nenjoy them; I should be ashamed and envious, that the misery and misfortune of my old age should have\ncredit over my good, healthful, sprightly, and vigorous years; and that men should estimate me, not by\nwhat I have been, but by what I have ceased to be.\nIn my opinion, it is the happy living, and not (as Antisthenes said) the happy dying, in which\nhuman felicity consists. I have not made it my business to make a monstrous addition of a philosopher=s\ntail to the head and body of a libertine; nor would I have this wretched remainder give the lie to the\npleasant, sound, and long part of my life: I would present myself uniformly throughout. Were I to live\nmy life over again, I should live it just as I have lived it; I neither complain of the past, nor do I fear the\nfuture; and if I am not much deceived, I have lived the same within me as I have without. it is my main\nobligation to my fortune that the succession of my bodily condition has been carried on according to the\nnatural seasons; I have seen the grass, the blossom, and the fruit; and now see the withering; happily,\nhowever, because naturally. I bear the infirmities I have the better because they came not till I had reason\nto expect them and because also they make me with greater pleasure remember that long felicity of my\npast life. My wisdom may have been just the same in both ages; but it was more active, and of better\ngrace when young and sprightly than now when broken, peevish and uneasy. I repudiate, then, these\ncasual and painful reformations. God must touch our hearts; our consciences must amend of themselves,\nby the aid of our reason, and not by the decay of our appetites; pleasure is, in itself, neither pale nor\ndiscolored, to be discerned by dim and decayed eyes.\n\nWe ought to love self-control both for itself and for the sake of God, who has commanded it and chastity;\nbut if we are lent them by rheumatism and kidney-stones, they are neither self-control nor chastity. A\nman cannot boast that he despises and resists pleasure if he cannot see it, if he knows not what it is, and\ncannot discern its graces, its force, and most alluring beauties; I know both the one and the other and may\ntherefore the better say it. But, methinks, our souls, in old age, are subject to more troublesome maladies\nand imperfections than in youth; I said the same when young and when I was reproached with the want\nof a beard; and I say so now that my gray hairs give me some authority. We call the difficulty of our\nhumors and the disrelish of present things wisdom; but, in truth, we do not so much forsake vices as we\nchange them, and, in my opinion, for worse. Besides a foolish and feeble pride, an impertinent prating,\nfroward and unsociable humors, superstition, and a ridiculous desire of riches when we have lost the use\nof them, I find there more envy, injustice and malice. Age imprints more wrinkles in the mind than it\ndoes on the face; and souls are never or very rarely seen that in growing old do not smell sour and musty.\nMan moves all together, both toward his perfection and decay. In observing the wisdom of Socrates, and\nmany circumstances of his condemnation, I should dare to believe, that he in some sort himself purposely,\nby collusion, contributed to it, seeing that, at the age of seventy years, he might fear to suffer the lofty\nmotions of his mind to be cramped, and his wonted luster obscured. What strange metamorphoses do I\nsee old age make everyk day my acquaintances! it is a potent malady that naturally and imperceptibly\nsteals into us; a vast provision of study and great precaution are required to evade the imperfections it\nloads us with, or at least, to weaken their progress. I find that, notwithstanding all my entrenchments, it\ngets foot by foot upon me; I make the best resistance I can, but I do not know to what at last it will reduce\nme. But fall out what will, I am content the world may know, when I am fallen, from what I fell.\nOF DIVERSION\nI was once employed in consoling a lady truly afflicted (for most of women=s mournings are\nartificial and ceremonious): [AA woman has ever a fountain of tears ready to gush up whenever she\nrequires to make use of them.@--Juvenal, vi. 272.] A man goes the wrong way to work when he opposes\nthis passion; for opposition does but irritate and make those who mourn more obstinate in sorrow; the evil\nis exasperated by discussion. We see this sort of effect in common discourse: what I have indifferently\nlet fall from me, if any one takes it up to controvert it, I justify it with the best arguments I have, and\nmuch more a thing wherein I had a real interest. And besides, in so doing you enter roughly upon your\noperation, whereas the first addresses of a physician to his patient should be gracious, gay, and pleasing;\nfor never did any ill-looking, morose physician do any good. On the contrary, then, a man should, at the\nfirst approaches, encourage their grief and express some approbation of their sorrow. By this intelligence\nyou obtain credit to proceed further, and by a facile and insensible gradation fall into discourses more\nsolid and proper for their cure.\nSince my aim was principally to deceive the company who had their eyes fixed upon me, I took it\ninto my head only to soothe the effects of the disease. And indeed I have found by experience that I have\nan unlucky hand in persuading. My arguments are either too sharp and dry, or pressed too roughly, or not\nhome enough. After I had some time applied myself to her grief, I did not attempt to cure her by strong\nand lively reasons, either because I had them not at hand, or because I thought to do my business better\nanother way; neither did I make choice of any of those methods of consolation which philosophy\nprescribes: that what we complain of is no evil, according to Cleanthes; that it is a light evil, according to\nthe Peripatetics; that to bemoan one's self is an action neither commendable nor just, according to\nChrysippus; nor this of Epicurus, more suitable to my way, of shifting the thoughts from afflicting things\nto those that are pleasing; nor making a bundle of all these together, to make use of upon occasion,\naccording to Cicero; but, gently bending my discourse, and by little and little digressing, sometimes to\nsubjects nearer, and sometimes more remote from the purpose, according as she was more intent on what\nI said, I imperceptibly led her from that sorrowful thought, and kept her calm and in good-humour whilst I\n\ncontinued there. I herein made use of diversion. They who succeeded me in the same service did not, for\nall that, find any amendment in her, for I had not laid axe to the root.\nI may elsewhere in these essays touched upon some sort of public diversions; and the practice of\nmilitary diversions, which Pericles made use of in the Peloponnesian war, and a thousand others in other\nplaces, to withdraw the adverse forces from their own countries, is frequently discussed in histories. It\nwas an ingenious evasion whereby Monseigneur d'Hempricourt saved both himself and others in the city\nof Liege, which the Duke of Burgundy, who kept it besieged, had made him enter to execute the articles\nof their promised surrender. The people, being assembled by night to consider of it, began to mutiny\nagainst the agreement, and several of them resolved to fall upon the commissioners, whom they had in\ntheir power; he, getting wind of the first wave of people who were coming to rush into his lodgings,\nsuddenly sent out to them two of the inhabitants of the city (of whom he had some with him) with new\nand milder terms to be proposed in their council, which he had then and there contrived for his need.\nThese two diverted the first tempest, bringin back the enraged rabble to the town-hall to hear and consider\nwhat they had to say. The deliberation was short; a second storm arose as violent as the other, whereupon\nhe despatched four new mediators of the same quality to meet them, protesting that he had now better\nconditions to present them with, and such as would give them absolute satisfaction, by which means the\ntumult was once more appeased, and the people again turned back to the conclave. In short, by this\ndispensation of amusements, one after another, diverting their fury and dissipating it in frivolous\nconsultations, he laid it at last asleep till the day appeared, which was his aim.\nThis other story that follows is also of the same category. Atalanta, a virgin of excelling beauty\nand of wonderful disposition of body, to disengage herself from the crowd of a thousand suitors who\nsought her in marriage, made this proposition, that she would accept of him for her husband who should\nequal her in running, upon condition that they who failed should lose their lives. There were enough who\nthought the prize very well worth the hazard, and who suffered the cruel penalty of the contract.\nHippomenes, about to make trial after the rest, made his address to the goddess of love, imploring her\nassistance; and she, granting his request, gave him three golden apples, and instructed him how to use\nthem. The race beginning, as Hippomenes perceived his mistress to press hard up to him; he, as it were\nby chance, let fall one of these apples; the maid, taken with the beauty of it, failed not to step out of her\nway to pick it up: [AThe virgin, astonished and attracted by the glittering apple, stops her career, and\nseizes the rolling gold.@ --Ovid, Metam., x. 666.]\nHe did the same, when he saw his time, by the second and the third, till by so diverting her, and\nmaking her lose so much ground, he won the race. When physicians cannot stop a catarrh, they divert and\nturn it into some other less dangerous part. And I find also that this is the most ordinary practice for the\ndiseases of the mind: [AThe mind is sometimes to be diverted to other studies, thoughts, cares, business:\nin fine, we cure by change of place, as we do with sick persons when they do not become\nconvalescent.@--Cicero, Tusc. Quaes., iv. 35.] 'Tis to little effect to jostle a man's infirmities directly; we\nneither make him sustain nor repel the attack; we rather make him decline and evade it.\nThis other lesson is too high and too difficult: 'tis for men of the first form of knowledge purely to\ninsist upon the thing, to consider and judge it; it appertains to one sole Socrates to meet death with an\nordinary countenance, to grow acquainted with it, and to sport with it; he seeks no consolation outside the\nthing itself; dying appears to him a natural and indifferent accident; 'tis there that he fixes his sight and\nresolution, without looking elsewhere. In contrast, the disciples of Hegesias, who starved themselves to\ndeath, inspired in this by his fine lectures, and in such numbers that King Ptolemy ordered he should be\nforbidden to entertain his followers with such homicidal doctrines, did not consider death in itself, neither\ndid they judge of it; it was not there they fixed their thoughts; they ran towards and aimed at a new being.\nThe poor wretches whom we see brought upon the scaffold, full of ardent devotion, and therein,\n\nas much as in them lies, employing all their senses, their ears in hearing the instructions given them, their\neyes and hands lifted up towards heaven, their voices in loud prayers, with a vehement and continual\nemotion, do doubtless things very commendable and proper for such a necessity, and we ought to\ncommend them for their piety. But we should not praise them for their constancy; they shun the\nencounter, they divert their thoughts from the consideration of death, as children are amused with some\ntoy or other when the surgeon is going to give them a prick with his lancet. I have seen some, who,\ncasting their eyes upon the dreadful instruments of death round about, have fainted, and furiously turned\ntheir thoughts another way; such as are to pass a formidable precipice are advised either to shut their eyes\nor to look another way.\nSubrius Flavius, being by Nero's command to be put to death, and by the hand of Niger, both of\nthem great captains, when they lead him to the place appointed for his execution, seeing the grave that\nNiger had caused to be hollowed to put him into ill-made: ANeither is this,@ said he, turning to the\nsoldiers who guarded him, Aaccording to military discipline.@ And to Niger, who exhorted him to keep\nhis head firm: ADo but thou strike as firmly,@ said he. And he correctly guessed at Niger=s failure of\nnerve; for Niger's arm so trembled that he had several blows at his head before he could cut it off. This\nman seems to have had his thoughts rightly fixed upon the subject.\nHe who dies in a battle, with his sword in his hand, does not then think of death; he feels or\nconsiders it not; the ardor of the fight diverts his thought another way. A worthy man of my\nacquaintance, falling as he was fighting a duel, and feeling himself nailed to the earth by nine or ten\nthrusts of his enemy, every one present called to him to think of his conscience; but he has since told me,\nthat though he very well heard what they said, it nothing moved him, and that he never thought of\nanything but how to disengage and revenge himself. He afterwards killed his man in that very duel. He\nwho brought to L. Silanus the sentence of death, did him a very great kindness, in that, having received\nhis answer, that he was well prepared to die, but not by base hands, he ran upon him with his soldiers to\nforce him, and as he, unarmed as he was, obstinately defended himself with his fists and feet, he made\nhim lose his life in the contest, by that means dissipating and diverting in a sudden and furious rage the\npainful apprehension of the lingering death to which he had been condemned.\nWe always think of something else; either the hope of a better life comforts and supports us, or\nthe hope of our children's worth, or the future glory of our name, or the leaving behind the evils of this\nlife, or the vengeance that threatens those who are the causes of our death, administers consolation to us:\n[AI hope, however, if the pious gods have any power, thou wilt feel thy punishment amid the rocks, and\nwill call on the name of Dido; I shall hear, and this report will come to me below.@--Aeneid, iv. 382,\n387.]\nXenophon was sacrificing with a crown upon his head when one came to bring him news of the\ndeath of his son Gryllus, slain in the battle of Mantinea. At the first impact of the news, he threw his\ncrown to the ground; but understanding by the sequel of the narrative how bravely his son had died, he\ntook the crown up again and replaced it upon his head. Epicurus himself, at his death, consoles himself\nupon the utility and eternity of his writings: [AAll labors that are illustrious and famous become\nsupportable.@ --Cicero, Tusc. Quaes., ii. 26.]\nand the same wound, the same fatigue, is not, says Xenophon, so intolerable to a general of an army as to\na common soldier. Epaminondas took his death much more cheerfully, having been informed that the\nvictory remained to him: [AThese are sedatives and alleviations to the greatest pains.@ --Cicero, Tusc.\nQuaes., ii. 23.]\nand such like circumstances amuse, divert, and turn our thoughts from the consideration of the thing in\nitself.\nEven the arguments of philosophy are always edging and glancing on the matter, so as scarce to rub its\n\ncrust; the greatest man of the first philosophical school, and superintendent over all the rest, the great\nZeno, forms this syllogism against death: ANo evil is honorable; but death is honorable; therefore death is\nno evil@; against drunkenness this: A No one commits his secrets to a drunkard; but every one commits\nhis secrets to a wise man: therefore a wise man is no drunkard.@ Is this to hit the bull=s-eye? I love to\nsee that these great and leading souls cannot rid themselves of our human nature: perfect men as they are,\nthey are yet simply men.\nRevenge is a sweet passion, of great and natural impression; I discern it well enough, though I\nhave no manner of experience of it. From this not long ago to divert a young prince, I did not tell him\nthat he must turn the other cheek, upon account of charity; nor did I represent to him the tragical events\nthat poetry attributes to this passion. I left that behind; and I busied myself to make him relish the beauty\nof a contrary image: and, by representing to him what honor, esteem, and goodwill he would acquire by\nclemency and good nature, diverted him to ambition. That is the way to deal with such cases.\nIf your passion of love be too violent, disperse it, they say, and they say true; for I have often\ntried it with advantage: break it into several desires, of which let one be regent, if you will, over the rest;\nbut, lest it should tyrannize and domineer over you, weaken and protract, by dividing and diverting it: and\nprovide for it in time, lest it prove troublesome to deal with, when it has once seized you. I was once\nwounded with a vehement grief, and withal, more just than vehement; I might peradventure have lost\nmyself in it, if I had merely trusted to my own strength. Having need of a powerful diversion to\ndisengage me, by art and study I became amorous, wherein I was assisted by my youth: love relieved and\nrescued me from the evil wherein friendship had engaged me. 'Tis in everything else the same; a violent\nimagination hath seized me: I find it a nearer way to change than to subdue it: I depute, if not one\ncontrary, yet another at least, in its place. Variation ever relieves, dissolves, and dissipates. If I am not\nable to contend with it, I escape from it; and in avoiding it, slip out of the way, and make, my doubles;\nshifting place, business, and company, I secure myself in the crowd of other thoughts and fancies, where\nit loses my trace, and I escape.\nAfter the same manner nature proceeds by the benefit of inconstancy; for time, which she has\ngiven us for the sovereign physician of our passions, chiefly works by this, that supplying our\nimaginations with other and new affairs, it loosens and dissolves the first sensation, no matter how strong.\nA wise man sees his friend dying hardly less vividly at the end of five-and-twenty years than on the first\nyear; and according to Epicurus, no less at all; for he did not attribute any alleviation of afflictions, either\nby reason of foreseing them or by reason of their growing old, but so many other thoughts traverse this\none over the course of time, that it languishes and tires at last.\nAlcibiades, to divert the inclination of common rumours, cut off the ears and tail of his beautiful\ndog, and turned him out into the public place, to the end that, giving the people this vicious action to prate\nabout, they might let his other actions alone. I have also seen, for this same end of diverting the opinions\nand conjectures of the people and to stop their mouths, some women conceal their real affections by those\nthat were only counterfeit; but I have also seen some of them, who in counterfeiting have suffered\nthemselves to be caught indeed, and who have quitted the true and original affection for the one that they\nfeigned to begin with: and so have learned that they who find their affections well placed are fools to\nconsent to this disguise. The public and favourable reception being reserved for this pretended lover, one\nmay conclude him a fellow of very little address and less wit, if he does not in the end put himself into\nyour place you into his; this is precisely to cut out and make up a shoe for another to draw on.\nA little thing will turn and divert us, because it is the little things that hold us. We do not much\nconsider subjects in their entirety and by themselves; it is the little and superficial circumstances, or\nimages that touch us, the outward useless rinds that peel off from the subjects themselves: [AAs husks we\nfind grasshoppers leave behind them in summer.@\n--Lucretius, v. 801.] Even Plutarch himself laments\n\nhis daughter for the little apish tricks of her infancy. The remembrance of a farewell, of the particular\ngrace of an action, of a last recommendation, afflict us. The sight of Caesar's robe troubled all Rome,\nwhich was more than his death had done. Even the sound of names ringing in our ears, as Amy poor\nmaster,@--Amy faithful friend,@--Aalas, my dear father,@ or, Amy sweet daughter,@ afflict us. When these\nrefrains pain me, and that I examine it a little nearer, I find 'tis no other but a grammatical and word\ncomplaint; I am only wounded with the word and tone, as the exclamations of preachers very often work\nmore by affecting hearing than reason, and as the pitiful eyes of a beast killed for my eating; without my\nweighing or penetrating meanwhile into the true and solid essence of my subject:\n[AWith these\nincitements grief provokes itself.@ --Lucretius, ii. 42.] These are the foundations of our mourning.\nThe obstinacy of my kidney-stone to all remedies especially those in my bladder, has sometimes\nthrown me into so long suppressions of urine for three or four days together that it had been folly to have\nhoped or even to have wished to evade death, considering the miseries I endured in those cruel fits. Oh,\nthat good emperor, who caused criminals to be tied that they might die for want of pissing, was a great\nmaster in the hangman's' science! Finding myself in this condition, I considered by how trivial were the\ncauses and objects imagination nourished in me to instill regret for losing life; of what atoms the weight\nand difficulty of dislodging life was composed in my soul; how many idle and frivolous thoughts we give\nway to in so great an affair; a dog, a horse, a book, a glass, and what not, were considered in my loss; to\nothers their ambitious hopes, their money, their knowledge, not less foolish considerations in my opinion\nthan mine. I looked upon death carelessly when I looked upon it universally as nothing more than the end\nof life. I insult over it when I see it as a whole, but in detail it domineers over me: the tears of a footman,\nthe disposing of my clothes, the touch of a friendly hand, a common consolation, discourages me and\nmakes me sorry for myself. So do the complaints in tragedies agitate our souls with grief; and the regrets\nof Dido and Ariadne in works of fiction impassionate those who do not believe in them. 'Tis a symptom\nof an obstinate and obdurate nature not to respond to them in this way, as 'tis reported for a miracle of\nPolemon; but then he did not so much as alter his countenance at the biting of a mad dog that tore away\nthe calf of his leg. No wisdom proceeds so far as to conceive so vivid and entire a cause of sorrow simply\nby exercise of judgment; it has its increase by presence, when the eyes and ears have their share; organs\nthat cannot be moved but by vain and incidental details.\n\nIs it reasonable that the arts themselves should take advantage of our natural stupidity and\nweakness? An orator, says rhetoric, in that farce which his pleading amounts to, shall himself be moved\nwith the sound of his own voice and feigned emotions, and suffer himself to be imposed upon by the\npassion he represents; he will imprint in himself a true and real grief, by means of the part he plays, to\ntransmit it to the judges, who are yet less concerned than he: as they do who are hired at funerals to assist\nin the ceremony of sorrow, who sell their tears and mourning by weight and measure; for although they\nact in a borrowed form, nevertheless, by habituating and settling their countenances to the occasion, 'tis\nmost certain they often are really affected with an actual sorrow. I was one, amongst several friends, who\nconveyed the body of Monsieur de Grammont to Spissons from the siege of La Fere, where he was slain;\nI observed that in all places we passed through we filled the people we met with lamentations and tears by\nthe mere solemn pomp of our convoy, for the name of the defunct was not there so much as known.\nQuintilian reports as to have seen actors so deeply engaged in a mourning part, that they still wept off-\nstage, and who, having taken upon them to stir up passion in another, have themselves espoused it to that\ndegree as to find themselves infected with it, not only to tears, but, moreover, with pallor and the\ncomportment of men really overwhelmed with grief.\nIn a country near our mountains the women play Priest Martin, for as they augment the regret of\nthe deceased husband by the remembrance of the good and agreeable qualities he possessed, they also at\nthe same time make a register of and publish his imperfections; as if of themselves to enter into some\ncomposition, and divert themselves from compassion to disdain. Yet with much better grace than we,\nwho, when we lose an acquaintance, strive to give him new and false praises, and to make him quite\nanother thing when we have lost sight of him than he appeared to us when we did see him; as if regret\nwere an instructive thing, or as if tears, by washing our understandings, cleared them. For my part, I\nhereby renounce all favorable testimonies men would give of me, not because I shall be worthy of them,\nbut because I shall be dead.\nWhoever shall ask a man, AWhat interest have you in this siege?@ he will say: AThe interest of\nsetting a good example and showing obedience to my prince: I aspire to no profit by it; and as for glory, I\nknow how small a part can affect a private man such as I: I have neither passion nor cause in this.@ And\nyet you shall see him the next day quite another man, chafing and red with fury, ranged in battle for the\nassault; 'tis the glittering of so much steel, the fire and noise of our cannon and drums, that have infused\nthis new rigidity and fury into his veins. A frivolous cause, you will say. How a cause? There needs\nnone to agitate the mind; a mere whimsy without body and without subject will rule and agitate it. Let me\nthing of building castles in Spain, my imagination suggests to me conveniences and pleasures with which\nmy soul is really tickled and pleased. How often do we torment our mind with anger or sorrow by such\nshadows, and engage ourselves in fantastic passions that impair both soul and body? What astonished,\nfleeting, confused grimaces does this raving put our faces into! what sallies and agitations both of limbs\nand voice does it inspire us with! Does it not seem that this individual man has false visions amid the\ncrowd of others with whom he has to do, or that he is possessed with some internal demon that persecutes\nhim? Inquire of yourself where is the object of this mutation? is there anything but us in nature which\ninanity sustains, over which inanity has its power?\nCambyses, from having dreamt that his brother should be one day king of Persia, put him to death: a\nbeloved brother, and one in whom he had always confided. Aristodemus, king of the Messenians, killed\nhimself out of a fancy of ill omen, from I know not what howling of his dogs; and King Midas did as\nmuch upon the account of some foolish dream he had dreamed. 'Tis to prize life at its just value to\nabandon it for a dream. And yet hear the soul triumph over the miseries and weakness of the body, which\nis exposed to all attacks and alterations; truly, it has a fine right to talk! [AO wretched clay, first formed\nby Prometheus. In his attempt, what little wisdom did he shew! In framing bodies, he did not apply his\nart to form the mind, which should have been his first concern.@--Propertius, iii. 5, 7.]\n\nOF CONSERVING YOUR WILL\nFew things, in comparison of what commonly affect other men, move me, or, to say better, few\nthings possess me: for 'tis right they should touch a man, provided they do not possess him. I am very\nsolicitous, both by study and argument, to cultivate this privilege of insensibility, which is in me already\nraised to a pretty degree by nature, so that consequently I espouse and am very much moved with very\nfew things. I have a clear sight enough, but I fix it upon very few objects; I have a sense delicate and\ntender enough; but an apprehension and application hard and negligent. I am very unwilling to engage\nmyself; as much as in me lies, I employ myself wholly on myself, and even in that subject should rather\nchoose to curb and restrain my affection from plunging itself over head and ears into it, it being a subject\nthat I possess at the mercy of others, and over which fortune has more right than I; so that even as to\nhealth, which I so much value, 'tis all the more necessary for me not so passionately to covet and heed it,\nthat I should find diseases insupportable. A man ought to moderate himself betwixt the hatred of pain and\nthe love of pleasure: and Plato sets down a middle path of life betwixt the two. But against such\naffections as wholly carry me away from myself and fix me elsewhere, against those, I say, I oppose\nmyself with my utmost power. 'Tis my opinion that a man should lend himself to others, and only give\nhimself to himself. Should my will happen to lend itself out and to be swayed, I should not stick there; I\nam too tender both by nature and practice to engage in hot and obstinate disputes, wherein, if my\nadversary would at last have the better, the issue would vex me to the last degree. Should I set myself to\nit at the rate that others do, my soul would never have the force to bear the emotion and alarms of those\nwho grasp at so much; it would immediately be disordered by the inward agitation that goes with such\nthings.\nIf, sometimes, I have been put upon the management of other men's affairs, I have promised to\ntake them in hand, but not into my lungs and liver; to take them upon me, but not to incorporate them; to\ntake pains, yes, but to be impassioned about it, never; I have a care of them, but I will not sit upon them. I\nhave enough to do to order and govern the domestic throng of those that I have in my own veins and\nbowels, without introducing a crowd of other outward pressures; and am sufficiently concerned about my\nown proper and natural business, without meddling with the concerns of others. Such as know how much\nthey owe to themselves, and how many offices they are bound to of their own, find that nature has cut\nthem out work enough of their own to keep them from being idle. You have enough business home:\ndon=t look away.\nMen let themselves out to hire; their faculties are not for themselves, but for those to whom they\nhave enslaved themselves; 'tis their tenants occupy them, not themselves. This common humor pleases\nnot me. We must be thrifty of the liberty of our souls, and never lend it but upon just occasions, which\nare very few, if we judge aright. Do but observe such as have accustomed themselves to be at every one's\ncall: they do it indiscriminately upon little as well as upon great, occasions; in that which does not\nconcern them as much as in what imports them most. They thrust themselves in indifferently wherever\nthere is work to do and obligation, and are without life when not in tumultuous bustle: [AThey are in\nbusiness for business' sake.@--Seneca, Ep., 22.]\nIt is not so much that they will go, as it is that they cannot stand still: like a rolling stone that\ncannot stop till it can go no further. Occupation, with a certain sort of men, is a mark of understanding\nand dignity: their souls seek repose in agitation, as children do by being rocked in a cradle; they may be\npronounced as serviceable to their friends as they are troublesome to themselves. No one distributes his\nmoney to others, but every one distributes his time and his life: there is nothing of which we are so\nprodigal as of these two things, of which to be thrifty would be both commendable and useful. I am of a\nquite contrary humour; I look to myself, and commonly covet with no great ardor what I do desire, and\ndesire little; and I employ myself and busy myself likewise, rarely and temperately. Whatever they take\n\nin hand, they do it with their utmost will and vehemence. There are so many dangerous steps, that, for the\nmore safety, we must a little lightly and superficially glide over the world, and not rush through it. Even\nsensual pleasure is painful in its depths: [AYou tread on fire, hidden under deceitful ashes.@ --Horace,\nOd., ii. i, 7.]\nThe Parliament of Bordeaux chose me mayor of their city at a time when I was at a distance from\nFrance, and still more remote from any such thought. I entreated to be excused, but I was told by my\nfriends that I had committed an error in so doing, because the king had interposed his command in that\naffair. 'Tis an office that ought to be looked upon so much more honorable, as it has no other salary nor\nadvantage than the bare honor of its execution. It continues two years, but may be extended by a second\nelection, which very rarely happens; it was to me, and had never been so but twice before: some years ago\nto Monsieur de Lansac, and lately to Monsieur de Biron, Marshal of France, in whose place I succeeded;\nand, I left mine to Monsieur de Matignon, Marshal of France also: proud of such noble company. Fortune\nhad a hand in my promotion, by this particular circumstance; for Alexander disdained the ambassadors of\nCorinth, who came to offer him a burgess-ship of their city; but when they proceeded to lay before him\nthat Bacchus and Hercules were also in the register, he graciously thanked them.\nAt my arrival, I faithfully and conscientiously represented myself to them for such as I find\nmyself to be--a man without memory, without vigilance, without experience, and without vigour; but also\nwithout hatred, without ambition, without avarice, and without violence; that they might be informed of\nmy qualities, and know what they were to expect from my service. And whereas the knowledge they had\nhad of my late father, and the honor they had for his memory, had alone incited them to confer this favor\nupon me, I plainly told them that I should be very sorry anything should make so great an impression\nupon me as their affairs and the concerns of their city had made upon him, whilst he held the government\nto which they had preferred me. I remembered, when a boy, to have seen him in his old age cruelly\ntormented with these public affairs, neglecting the soft repose of his own house, to which the declension\nof his age had reduced him for several years before, the management of his own affairs, and his health;\nand certainly despising his own life, which was in great danger of being lost, by being engaged in long\nand painful journeys on their behalf. Such was he; and this humor of his proceeded from a marvelous\ngood nature; never was there a more charitable and public-spirited soul. Yet this course of his, which I\ncommend in others, I do not love to follow myself, and I am not without excuse.\nHe had heard it said that a man should forget himself for his neighbor and that the individual was\nof no manner of consideration in comparison with the general good. Most of the rules and precepts of the\nworld run this way; to drive us out of ourselves into the street for the benefit of public society; they\nthought to do a great feat to divert and remove us from ourselves, assuming we were but too much\nattached to ourselves, and by a too natural inclination; and have said all they could to that purpose: for it\nis no new thing for the sages to preach things as they serve, not as they are. Truth has its disadvantages,\ninconveniences, and incompatibilities with us; we must often be deceived that we may not deceive\nourselves; and shut our eyes and our understandings to redress and amend them: [AFor the ignorant judge,\nand therefore are often to be deceived, to prevent them from judging erroneously.@ --Quintil., Inst. Orat.,\nxi. 17.] When they order us to love three, four, or fifty degrees of things above ourselves, they do like\narchers, who, to hit the bull=s-eye, take their aim a great deal higher than the target; to make a crooked\nstick straight, we bend it the contrary way.\nI believe that in the Temple of Pallas, as we see in all other religions, there were apparent\nmysteries to be exposed to the people; and others, more secret and high, that were only to be shown to\nsuch as were initiated; 'tis likely that in these the true point of friendship that every one owes to himself is\nto be found; not a false friendship, that makes us embrace glory, knowledge, riches, and the like, with a\nprincipal and immoderate affection, as members of our being; nor a languid and indiscriminate friendship,\nwhose effects we see in the case of ivy, which decays and ruins the walls it embraces; but a sound and\n\nregular friendship, equally beneficial and pleasant. He who knows the duties of this friendship to oneself\nand practises them is truly of the cabinet of the Muses and has attained to the height of human wisdom\nand of our happiness; such a one, exactly knowing what he owes to himself, will on his part find that he\nought to apply to himself his experience of the world and of other men; and in order to do this he will\ncontribute to public society the duties and offices that fall to him. He who does not in some way live for\nothers cannot live much for himself: [AHe who is his own friend, is a friend to everybody else.@ --Seneca,\nEp., 6.]\nThe principal responsibility we each have is to rule ourselves; and 'tis for this only that we here\nare. As he who should forget to live a virtuous and holy life, and should think he acquitted himself of his\nduty in instructing and training others up to it, would be a fool; even so he who abandons his own\nparticular healthful and pleasant living to serve others therewith, takes, in my opinion, a bad and\nunnatural course. I would not that men should refuse, in the employments they take upon them, their\nattention, pains, eloquence, sweat, and blood if need be: [AHimself not afraid to die for beloved friends,\nor for his country.@--Horace, Od., iv. 9, 51.] but this is only by way of loan and incidentally; his mind\nbeing always in repose and in health; not without action, but without vexation, without passion. To be\nsimply acting costs the mind so little that it is active even sleeping; but it must be set on going with\ndiscretion, for the body receives the offices imposed upon it just according to what they are but the mind\noften extends and makes them heavier at its own expense, giving them what measure it pleases.\nDifferent men perform like things with different degrees of exertion and different degrees of will\nand the exertion and the will each does well enough without the other; for how many people hazard\nthemselves every day in war without any concern which way it goes; and thrust themselves into the\ndangers of battles, the loss of which will not break their next night's sleep? and such a man may be at\nhome, out of a danger that he would not have had the courage to face, and he may be more passionately\nconcerned for the issue of this war, and his soul more worked up about events than the soldier who stakes\nhis blood and his life. I could have engaged myself in public employments without quitting my own\nmatters a nail's breadth, and have given myself to others without robbing myself of myself. This\nsharpness and violence of desires more hinder than they advance the execution of what we undertake; fill\nus with impatience against slow or contrary events, and with heat and suspicion against those with whom\nwe have to do. We never carry on that thing well which leads and possesses us: [AImpulse manages all\nthings ill.@--Statius, Thebaid, x. 704.] He who therein employs only his judgment and skill proceeds\nmore cheerfully: he counterfeits, he gives way, he defers quite at his ease, according to the necessities of\noccasions; he fails in his attempt without trouble and affliction, ready and entire for a new enterprise; he\nalways walks with the bridle in his hand. In him who is intoxicated with a violent and tyrannical\nintention, we discover, of necessity, much imprudence and injustice; the impetuosity of his desire carries\nhim away; these are rash motions, and, if fortune do not very much assist, of very little fruit.\nPhilosophy directs that, in the revenge of injuries received, we should strip ourselves of deep\nanger; not that the chastisement should be less, but, on the contrary, that the revenge may be the better\nand more heavily laid on, which, it conceives, will be by this impetuosity hindered. For anger not only\ndisturbs, but, of itself, also wearies the arms of those who chastise; this fire benumbs and wastes their\nforce; as in precipitation, Afestinatio tarda est,@ (More haste, less speed)--haste trips up its own heels,\nfetters, and stops itself. For example, according to what I commonly see, avarice has no greater\nimpediment than itself; the more bent and vigorous it is, the less it rakes together, and commonly sooner\ngrows rich when disguised in a visor of liberality.\nA very excellent gentleman, and a friend of mine, ran a risk of impairing his faculties by a too\npassionate attention and affection to the affairs of a certain prince his master; while that very master has\nthus portrayed himself to me; that he foresees the weight of accidents as well as another, but that in those\nfor which there is no remedy, he presently resolves upon suffering; in others, having taken all the\n\nnecessary precautions which by the vivacity of his understanding he can presently do, he quietly awaits\nwhat may follow. And, in truth, I have accordingly seen this master maintain a great indifferency and\nliberty of actions and serenity of countenance in very great and difficult affairs: I find him much greater,\nand of greater capacity in adverse than in prosperous fortune; his defeats are to him more glorious than his\nvictories, and his mourning than his triumph.\nConsider, that even in vain and frivolous actions, as at chess, tennis, and the like, this eager and\nardent engaging with an impetuous desire, immediately throws the mind and members into indiscretion\nand disorder: a man astounds and hinders himself; he who carries himself more moderately, both towards\ngain and loss, has always his wits about him; the less peevish and passionate he is at play, he plays much\nmore advantageously and surely.\nAs to the rest, we hinder the mind's grasp and hold, in giving it so many things to seize upon;\nsome things we should only offer to it; tie it to others, and with others incorporate it. It can feel and\ndiscern all things, but ought to feed upon nothing but itself; and should be instructed in what properly\nconcerns itself what is properly of its own having and substance. The laws of nature teach us what justly\nwe need. When the sages tell us that no one is poor according to nature, and that every one is so\naccording to opinion, they very subtly distinguish between the desires that proceed from her, and those\nthat proceed from the disorder of our own fancy: those of which we can see the end are hers; those that fly\nbefore us, and of which we can see no end, are our own. Poverty of goods is easily cured; poverty of the\nsoul is irreparable: [AFor if what is for man enough, could be enough, it were enough; but since it is not\nso, how can I believe that any wealth can give my mind content?@--Lucilius aped Nonium Marcellinum,\nV. sec. 98.]\nSocrates, seeing a great quantity of riches, jewels, and furniture carried in pomp through his city:\nAHow many things,@ said he, AI do not desire!@--[Cicero, Tusc. Quaes., V. 32.]--Metrodorus lived on\ntwelve ounces a day, Epicurus upon less; Metrocles slept in winter abroad amongst sheep, in summer in\nthe cloisters of churches:\n[ANature provides for all that nature Nature needs.@--Seneca, Ep., 90.]\nCleanthes lived by the labor of his own hands, and boasted that Cleanthes, if he would, could yet maintain\nanother Cleanthes.\nIf what nature directly and originally requires of us for the preservation of our being be too little\n(and in truth how little that is and how cheaply a good life may be maintained, cannot be better expressed\nthan by this consideration, that it is so little that by its littleness it escapes the grip and shock of fortune),\nlet us allow ourselves a little more; let us call every one of our habits and conditions Anature@; let us\nvalue and treat ourselves by this measure; let us stretch our appurtenances and accounts so far; for so far, I\nfancy, we have some excuse. Habit is a second nature, and no less powerful. What is wanting to my\nhabit, I reckon is wanting to me; and I should be almost as well content that they took away my life as cut\nme short in the way wherein I have so long lived. I am no longer in condition for any great change, nor to\nput myself into a new and unwonted course, not even to augmentation. 'Tis past the time for me to\nbecome other than I am; and as I should complain of any great windfall that should now drop into my\nhands, that it came not in time to be enjoyed: [AWhat is the good fortune to me, if it is not granted to me\nto use it.@--Horace, Ep., i. 5, 12.] so should I complain of any inward acquisition.\nIt were almost better never, than so late, to become an honest man, and well fit to live, when one\nhas no longer to live. I, who am about to make my exit out of the world, would easily resign to any\nnewcomer, who should desire it, all the prudence I am now acquiring in the world's commerce; it is\nmustard after meat. I have no need of goods of which I can make no use; of what use is knowledge to him\nwho has lost his head? 'Tis an injury and unkindness in fortune to tender us presents that will only inspire\nus with a just despite that we had them not in their due season. Guide me no more; I can no longer go.\nOf so many parts as make up a sufficiency, patience is the most sufficient. Give the capacity of an\n\nexcellent treble to the chorister who has rotten lungs, and eloquence to a hermit exiled into the deserts of\nArabia. There needs no art to help a fall; the end finds itself by itself at the conclusion of every affair.\nMy world is at an end, my form expired; I am totally of the past, and am bound to admit its authority and\nto conform my outgoing to it. I will here declare, by way of example, that the Pope's late ten days'\ndiminution1 has taken me so aback that I cannot well reconcile myself to it; I belong to the years wherein\nwe counted differently. So ancient and so long a custom calls me back to it, so that I am constrained to be\nsomewhat heretical on that point, and incapable of any innovation, however much it makes things better.\nMy imagination, in spite of my teeth, always pushes me ten days forward or backward, and is ever\nmurmuring in my ears: AThis rule concerns those who are just being born.@ If health itself, sweet as it is,\nreturns to me by fits, 'tis rather to give me cause of regret than possession of it; I have no place left to\nkeep it in. Time leaves me; without which nothing can be possessed. Oh, what little account should I\nmake of those great elective dignities that I see in such esteem in the world, that are never conferred but\nupon men who are taking leave of it; wherein they do not so much regard how well the man will\ndischarge his trust, as how short his administration will be: from the very entry they look at the exit. In\nshort, I am about finishing this man, and not reconstructing another out of him. By long use, this form of\nmine is turned into substance, and chance into nature.\n1 Gregory XIII., in 1582, reformed the Calendar, and the French at once passed from the 9th to\nthe 20th of December.\n\nI say, therefore, that every one of us feeble creatures is excusable in thinking that to be his own\nwhich is comprised under the measure of habit. But withal, beyond these limits, 'tis nothing but\nconfusion; this measure is the largest extent we can grant to our own claims. The more we amplify our\nneed and our possession, so much the more do we expose ourselves to the blows of Fortune and\nadversities. The career of our desires ought to be circumscribed and restrained to a short limit of the\nnearest and most contiguous commodities; and their course ought, moreover, to be performed not in a\nright line, that ends somewhere else, but in a circle, of which the two points, by a short wheel, meet and\nterminate in ourselves.\nActions that are carried on without this reflection (a near and essential reflection, I mean), such as\nthose of ambitious and avaricious men, who run in a straight line and whose career always carries them\nforwardCsuch actions, I say, are erroneous and sickly. Most of our business is farce: The whole world\nplays a part.BPetronius. We must play our part properly, but withal as a part of a borrowed personage;\nwe must not make real essence of a mask and outward appearance; nor of a strange person, our own; we\ncannot distinguish the skin from the shirt: 'tis enough to put make-up on the face, without make-upping\nthe heart. I see some who transform and transubstantiate themselves into as many new shapes and new\nbeings as they undertake new employments; and who strut and fume even to the heart and liver, and carry\ntheir state along with them even to the shit-house: I cannot get them to distinguish the gestures of\ndeference that are made to them from those that are made to their official rank, their subordinates, or their\nmule: [AThey so much give themselves up to fortune, as even to unlearn nature.@--Quintus Curtius, iii.\n2.] They swell and puff up their souls, and their natural way of speaking, according to the height of their\nmagisterial place.\nThe Mayor of Bordeaux and Michel de Montaigne have always been two by very manifest\nseparation. Because we are lawyers or enterprise capitalists, we must not ignore the knavery there is in\nsuch callings; an honest man is not accountable for the vice or absurdity of his employment, and ought\nnot on that account refuse to take the calling upon him: 'tis the usage of his country, and there is money to\nbe got by it; a man must live by the world; and make his best of it, such as it is. But the judgment of an\nemperor ought to be above his empire, and should see and consider it as a foreign accident; and he ought\nto know how to enjoy himself apart from it, and to present himself like any Joe, at least when presenting\nhimself to himself.\nI cannot engage myself so deep and so entire; when my will puts me on one side, 'tis not with so\nviolent an obligation that my judgment is infected with it. In the present broils of this kingdom, my own\ninterest has not made me blind to the laudable qualities of our adversaries, nor to those that are\nreproachable in those men of our party. Others adore all of their own side; for my part, I do not so much\nas excuse most things in those of mine: a good work has never the worst grace with me for being made\nagainst me. The knot of the controversy excepted, I have always kept myself in equanimity and pure\nindifference: [ANor bear particular hatred beyond the necessities of war.@] for which I am pleased with\nmyself; and the more because I see others commonly fail in the contrary direction. Such as extend their\nanger and hatred beyond the dispute in question, as most men do, show that they spring from some other\noccasion and private cause; like one who, being cured of an ulcer, has yet a fever remaining, by which it\nappears that the ulcer had another more concealed beginning. The reason is that the common cause has\nnot engaged them because its adversary is wounding to the state and general interest; they are nettled only\nby reason of their particular concern. This is why they are so especially animated, and to a degree so far\nbeyond justice and public reason: [AEvery one was not so much angry against things in general, as\nagainst those that particularly concern himself.@ --Livy, xxxiv. 36.]\nI would have the advantage on our side; but if it be not, I shall not run mad. I am heartily for the\nright party; but I do not want to be taken notice of as an especial enemy to others, and beyond the general\nquarrel. I marvelously challenge such vicious forms of opinion as these: AHe must be of the League\n\nbecause he admires the graciousness of Monsieur de Guise; he is astonished at the King of Navarre's\nenergy, therefore he must be a Huguenot; he criticizes the king, therefore he is a rebel against France.@\nAnd I did not grant to the Pope himself that he did well in condemning a book because it had placed a\nheretic amongst the best poets of the time. Shall we not dare to say of a thief that he has a handsome leg?\nIf a woman be a strumpet, must it needs follow that she has a foul smell? Did they in the wisest ages\nrevoke the proud title of Capitolinus they had before conferred on Marcus Manlius as conservator of\nreligion and the public liberty, and stifle the memory of his liberality, his feats of arms, and military\nrecompenses granted to his valor, because he, afterwards aspired to the sovereignty, to the prejudice of\nthe laws of his country? If we take a hatred against a lawyer today, we will deny his eloquence tomorrow.\nI have elsewhere spoken of the zeal that pushed on worthy men to the like faults. For my part, I can say,\nASuch an one does this thing ill, and another thing virtuously and well.@ So in foretelling good or bad\noutcomes to events, they would have every one blind or stupid in the party cause, and our persuasion and\njudgment serve not truth but the project of our desires. I should rather incline towards the other extreme;\nso much I fear being suborned by my desire; to which I may add that I am a little tenderly distrustful of\nthings that I wish for.\nI have in my time seen wonders in the indiscreet and prodigious facility of people to be led by the\nnose in suffering their hopes and belief to be manipulatged which way best pleased and served their\nleaders, despite a hundred mistakes one upon another, despite mere dreams and phantasms. I no longer\nwonder at those who have been blinded and seduced by the fooleries of Apollonius and Mahomet. Their\nsense and understanding are absolutely taken away by their passion; their discretion has no more any\nother choice than that which smiles upon them and encourages their cause. I had principally observed this\nin the beginning of our internal discords; that other, which has sprung up since, in imitating, has\nsurpassed it; by which I am satisfied that it is a quality inseparable from popular errors; after the first\nerror, others drive on one another like waves with the wind: a man is not a member of the body, if he\nshows it in his power to criticise it, and if he do not roll the common way. But, doubtless, we wrong the\njust side when we go about to assist it with fraud; I have ever been against that practice: 'tis only fit to\nwork upon weak heads; for the sound, there are surer and more honest ways to keep up their courage and\nto explain adverse accidents.\nHeaven never saw a greater animosity than that betwixt Caesar and Pompey, nor ever shall; and\nyet I observe, methinks, in those brave souls, a great moderation towards one another: it was a jealousy of\nhonor and command, which did not transport them to a furious and indiscreet hatred, and was without\nmalignity and detraction: in their hottest exploits upon one another, I discover some remains of respect\nand good-will: and am therefore of opinion that, had, it been possible, each of them would rather have\ndone his business without the ruin of the other than with it. Take notice how much otherwise matters went\nwith Marius and Sylla. We must not precipitate ourselves so headlong after our affections and interests.\nAs, when I was young, I opposed myself to the progress of love which I perceived to advance too fast\nupon me, and had a care lest it should at last become so pleasing as to force, captivate, and wholly reduce\nme to its mercy: so I do the same upon all other occasions where my will is running on with too warm an\nappetite. I lean opposite to the side it inclines to, as I find it going to plunge and make itself drunk with\nits own wine; I evade nourishing its pleasure beyond the point at which I cannot recover myself without\ninfinite loss.\nSouls that, through their own stupidity, only discern things by halves, have this happiness, that\nhurtful things hurt them less: 'tis a spiritual leprosy that has some show of health, and such a health as\nphilosophy does not altogether condemn; but yet we have no reason to call it wisdom, as we often do.\nAnd after this manner some one anciently mocked Diogenes, who, in the depth of winter and quite naked,\nwent embracing a snowman for a trial of his endurance: the other seeing him in this position, AAre you\nnow very cold?@ said he. ANot at all,@ replied Diogenes. AWhy, then,@ pursued the other, Awhy do you\nthink it so difficult and exemplary to do what your are doing?@ To take a true measure of fortitude, one\n\nmust know what suffering is. But souls that are to meet with adverse events and the injuries of fortune, in\ntheir depth and sharpness, that are to weigh and taste them according to their natural weight and\nbitterness, let them show their skill in avoiding the causes and diverting the blow. What did King Cotys\ndo? He paid liberally for the rich and beautiful vessel that had been presented to him, but, seeing it was\nexceedingly brittle, he immediately broke it, to prevent so easy a matter of displeasure against his\nservants. In like manner, I have willingly avoided all confusion in my affairs, and never coveted to have\nmy estate contiguous to those of my relations, and such with whom I coveted a strict friendship; for\nthence matter of unkindness and falling out often proceeds. I formerly loved hazardous games of cards\nand dice; but have long since left them off, only for this reason that, with whatever good air I carried my\nlosses, I could not help feeling vexed within. A man of honor, who ought to be sensible of the lie or of an\ninsult, and who is not to take a scurvy excuse for satisfaction, should avoid occasions of dispute. I shun\nmelancholy, crabbed men, as I would the plague; and in matters I cannot talk of without emotion and\nconcern I never meddle, if not compelled by my duty: [AThey had better never to begin than to have to\ndesist.@ --Seneca, Ep., 72.]\nThe surest way, therefore, is to prepare one's self beforehand for every occasion. I know very\nwell that some wise men have taken another way, and have not feared to grapple and engage to the utmost\nupon several subjects. These are confident of their own strength, under which they protect themselves in\nall ill successes, making their patience wrestle and contend with disaster: [AAs a rock, which projects\ninto the vast ocean, exposed to the furious winds and the raging sea, defies the force and menaces of sky\nand sea, itself unshaken.@--Virgil, Aeneid, x. 693.]\nLet us not attempt these examples; we shall never come up to them. Having screwed up their will to\ndevote themselves entirely to their country, they set themselves resolutely, and without agitation, to\nbehold its ruin. This is too much, and too hard a task for our commoner souls. Cato gave up the noblest\nlife that ever was upon this account; we meaner spirits must fly from the storm as far as we can; we must\ntry to avoid such devotions, and evade the blows we cannot meet, rather than train up patience in\nsuffering. Zeno, seeing Chremonides, a young man whom he loved, draw near to sit down by him,\nsuddenly started up; and Cleanthes demanding of him the reason why he did so, AI hear,@ said he, Athat\nphysicians especially order repose, and forbid emotion in all kinds of swellings.@ Socrates does not say:\nADo not surrender to the charms of beauty; stand your ground, and do your utmost to oppose it.@ AFly\nit,@ says he; Ashun the fight and encounter of it, as if it were a powerful poison that darts and wounds at a\ndistance.@ And his good disciple, Xenophon, imagining or recounting, but, in my opinion, rather\nrecounting than imagining, the rare perfections of the great Cyrus, makes Cyrus distrustful of his strength\nto resist the charms of the divine beauty of that illustrous Panthea, his captive, and committing the visiting\nand keeping her to another, who could not have so much liberty as himself. And the Holy Ghost in like\nmanner: ALead us not into temptation.@ [St. Matthew, vi. 13.] We do not pray that our reason may\novercome lust, but that it should not be so much as tried by it; that we should not be brought into a state\nwherein we are so much as to suffer the approaches, solicitations, and temptations of sin: and we beg of\nAlmighty God to keep our consciences quiet, fully and perfectly delivered from all commerce of evil.\nSuch as say that they have conquered their passion for revenge, or any other sort of troublesome\nagitation of mind, often say true, as things now are, but not as they were: they speak to us now that the\ncauses of their error have been modified by themselves; but look backward, recall these causes to their\nbeginning, and there you will make them speechless. Will they have their faults less, for being in the past\nand that the sequel of an unjust beginning can be just? Whoever shall desire the good of his country, as I\ndo, without fretting or pining himself, will be troubled, but will not swoon to see it threatening either its\nown ruin, or a no less ruinous continuance; poor vessel, that the waves, the winds, and the pilot toss about\nwith such contray intentions! [Dragged in different ways by master, waves and windsBBuchanan]\nHe who does not gape after the favor of princes, as after a thing he cannot live without, does not\nmuch concern himself at the coldness of their reception and countenance, nor at the inconstancy of their\n\nwills. He who does not brood over his children or his honors with a slavish fondness, manages to get by\nwell enough after their loss. He who does good principally for his own satisfaction will not be much\ntroubled to see men judge of his actions contrary to their merit. A quarter of an ounce of patience will\nprovide sufficiently against such inconveniences. I find ease in this recipe, by myself off in the beginning\nas cheaply as I can; and find that by this means I have escaped much trouble and many difficulties. With\nvery little fuss I stop the first sally of my emotions, and leave the subject that begins to be troublesome\nbefore it transports me. He who stops not their start will never be able to stop their course; he who cannot\nkeep them out will never, get them out when they are once got in; and he who cannot get the better of\nthem at the beginning will never do so at the end. Nor will he bear the fall who cannot sustain the push:\n[AFor they throw themselves headlong when once they lose their reason; and infirmity so far indulges\nitself, and from want of prudence is carried out into deep water, nor finds a place to shelter it.@--Cicero,\nTusc. Quaes., iv. 18.]\nFrom time to time, I become sensible of the little breezes that begin to sing and whistle within,\nforerunners of the storm: [AAs the breezes, pent in the woods, first send out dull murmurs, announcing\nthe approach of winds to mariners.@--Aeneid, x. 97.] How often have I done myself a manifest injustice\nto avoid the hazard of having yet a worse done me by judges, after an age of vexations, dirty and vile\npractices, more enemies to my nature than fire or the rack?\n[AA man should abhor lawsuits as much as\nhe may, and I know not whether not something more; for 'tis not only liberal, but sometimes also\nadvantageous, too, a little to recede from one's right.\n--ACicero, De Offic., ii. 18.] Were we wise, we\nought to rejoice and boast, as I one day heard a young gentleman of a good family do naively, that his\nmother had lost a lawsuit, as if it had been a cough, a fever, or something very troublesome to keep. Even\nthe favors that fortune has given me through relationship or acquaintance with those who have sovereign\nauthority, I have very conscientiously and very carefully avoided using to the prejudice of others or to\nadvance my pretensions above their true right.\nIn short, I have so much succeeded in my labors (knock wood!) that I am to this day a virgin from\nall suits in law; though I have had very fair offers made me, and with very just title would I have\nhearkened to them, and a virgin from quarrels too. I shall soon have passed a long life without giving or\nreceiving any serious offence, or without being called by a worse word than my own name: a rare favor of\nHeaven.\nOur greatest agitations have ridiculous springs and causes: what ruin did our last Duke of\nBurgundy run into about a cartload of sheepskins2! And was not the graving of a seal the first and\nprincipal cause of the greatest commotion that this machine, the world, ever underwent? for Pompey and\nCaesar were but the offsets and continuation of the two others: and I have in my time seen the wisest\nheads in this kingdom assembled with great ceremony, and at the public expense, about treaties and\nagreements, of which the true decision, in the meantime, absolutely depended upon the ladies' cabinet\ncouncil, and the inclination of some bit of a woman. The poets very well understood this when they put\nall Greece and Asia to fire and sword about an apple. Look why that man hazards his life and honor upon\nthe fortune of his rapier and dagger; let him acquaint you with the occasion of the quarrel; he cannot do it\nwithout blushing, the occasion is so idle and frivolous.\nA little thing will engage you in it; but being once embarked, all the ropes need pulling; great\nprovisions are then required, more hard and more important. How much easier is it not to enter in than it\nis to get out? Rather, we should proceed contrary to the reed, which, at its first springing, produces a long\n2A reference to the war between Charles the Bold and the Swiss in 1476. The next sentence\nrefers to the civil war between Marius and Sylla, caused by a seal that Sulla had engraved to\ncommemorate one of his victories. Plutarch regarded this as the start of the disastrous civil wars that\nfollowed.\n\nand straight shoot, but afterwards, as if tired and out of breath, it runs into thick and frequent joints and\nknots, as so many pauses which demonstrate that it has no more its first vigor and firmness; 'twere better\nto begin gently and coldly, and to keep one's breath and vigorous efforts for the height and stress of the\nbusiness. We guide affairs in their beginnings, and have them in our own power; but afterwards, when\nthey are once at work, 'tis they that guide and govern us, and we must follow them.\nYet do I not mean to say that this counsel has discharged me of all difficulty, and that I have not\noften had enough to do to curb and restrain my passions. They are not always to be governed according\nto the measure of occasions, and even their beginnings are often very sharp and violent. But still good\nfruit and profit may be reaped by this plan; except for those who in well-doing are not satisfied with any\nbenefit if reputation be wanting; for, in truth, such an effect is valued only by every one to himself. You\nare better contented, but not more esteemed if you reformed yourself before you got into the whirl of the\ndance and the provocative matter came in sight. Yet not in this only, but in all other duties of life also,\nthe way of those who aim at honor is very different from the one followed by those who aim at order and\nreason. I find some who rashly and furiously rush into the lists and then slow down in the charge.\nPlutarch says that those are ready to grant whatever is desired of them out of weakness are afterwards as\nready to break their word and to recant; just so, he who enters lightly into a quarrel is apt to go as lightly\nout of it. With me it is the opposite: the same difficulty that keeps me from entering into a quarrel would,\nonce I am hot and engaged, incite me to maintain it with great obstinacy and resolution. 'Tis a bad habit;\nwhen a man is once engaged; he must go through with it, or die. AUndertake coolly,@ said Bias, Abut\npursue with ardor.@ For want of prudence, men fall into want of courage, which is still more intolerable.\nMost accommodations of the quarrels of these days of ours are shameful and false; we only seek\nto save appearances, and in the meantime betray and disavow our true intentions; we salve over the fact.\nWe know very well how we said the thing, and in what sense we spoke it, and the company know it, and\nour friends whom we have wished to make sensible of our advantage, understand it well enough too: 'tis\nat the expense of our frankness and of the honor of our courage, that we disown our thoughts, and seek\nrefuge in falsities, to make matters up. We give ourselves the lie, to excuse the lie we have given to\nanother. You are not to consider if your word or action may admit of another interpretation; 'tis your own\ntrue and sincere interpretation, your real meaning in what you said or did, that you are thenceforward to\nmaintain, whatever it cost you. Men speak to your virtue and conscience, which are not things to be put\nunder a mask; let us leave these pitiful ways and expedients to lawyers. The excuses and reparations that\nI see every day made and given to repair indiscretion, seem to me more scandalous than the indiscretion\nitself. It were better to affront your adversary a second time than to offend yourself by giving him so\nunmanly a satisfaction. You have braved him in your heat and anger, and you would flatter and appease\nhim in your cooler and better sense; and by that means lay yourself lower and at his feet, whom before\nyou pretended to overtop. I do not find anything a gentleman can say so vicious in him as unsaying what\nhe has said is infamous, when to unsay it is wrenched from him by authority, since obstinacy is more\nexcusable in a man of honor than pusillanimity.\nPassions are as easy for me to evade, as they are hard for me to moderate: [AThey are more easily\nto be eradicated than governed.@] He who cannot attain the noble Stoical imperturbability, let him secure\nhimself in the bosom of this commonplace callousness of mine; what they performed by virtue, I train\nmyself to do by temperament. The middle region harbors storms and tempests; the two extremes, of\nphilosophers and peasants, concur in tranquillity and happiness: [AHappy is he who could discover the\ncauses of things, and place under his feet all fears and inexorable fate, and the sound of rapacious\nAcheron: he is blesed who knows the country gods, and Pan, and old Sylvanus, and the sister\nnymphs.@--Virgil, Georg., ii. 490.] The births of all things are weak and tender; and therefore we should\nhave our eyes intent on beginnings; for as when, in its infancy, the danger is not perceived, so when it is\ngrown up, the remedy is as little to be found. I might have encountered a million troubles every day,\nharder to digest in the course of ambition than it has been hard for me to curb the natural ambition that\n\ninclined me to it: [AI ever justly feared to raise my head too high.@ --Horace, Od.,iii. 16, 18.]\nAll public actions are subject to uncertain and various interpretations; for too many heads judge\nof them. Some say of this civic employment of mine (and I am willing to say a word or two about it, not\nthat it is worth so much, but to give an account of my manners in such things), that I have behaved myself\nin it as a man who is too supine and of a languid temperament; and they have some excuse for what they\nsay. I endeavoured to keep my mind and my thoughts in repose; [AAs being always quiet by nature, so\nalso now by age.@ --Cicero, De Petit. Consul., c. 2.] and if they sometimes lash out upon some rude and\nsensible impression, 'tis in truth without my prompting. Yet from this natural heaviness of mine, men\nought not to conclude that I am incapable (for want of care and want of sense are two very different\nthings), and much less that I am unmindful or ungratitude of my obligations to those citizens who\nemployed the utmost means they had in their power to show me good will, both before they knew me and\nafter; and who honored me more by re-electing me than they did in conferring the office of mayor upon\nme at first. I wish them all imaginable good; and assuredly had occasion been, there is nothing I would\nhave spared for their service; I did for them as I would have done for myself. 'Tis a good, warlike, and\ngenerous people, capable of obedience and discipline, and of whom the best use may be made, if well\nguided.\nThey say also that my administration passed over without leaving any mark or trace. Good!\nThey accuse me of doing too little in a time when almost everybody was convicted of doing too much. I\nam impatient to be doing where my will spurs me on; but this itself is an enemy to perseverance. Let him\nwho will make use of me according to my own way, employ me in affairs where vigor and liberty are\nrequired, where a direct, short, and, moreover, a hazardous conduct are necessary; I may do something;\nbut if it must be long, subtle, laborious, artificial and intricate, he had better call in somebody else. All\nimportant offices are not necessarily difficult: I came prepared to do somewhat rougher work, had there\nbeen great occasion; for it is in my power to do something more than I do, or than I love to do. I did not,\nto my knowledge, omit anything that my duty really required. I easily forgot those offices that ambition\nmixes with and disguises by the name of duty. These are things that, for the most part, fill the eyes and\nears, and give men the most satisfaction; not reality but the appearance contents them; if they hear no\nnoise, they think we are asleep. My humor is no friend to tumult; I could appease a commotion without\ncommotion, and chastise a disorder without being myself disorderly; if I stand in need of anger and\ninflammation, I borrow it, and put it on. My manners are languid, rather faint than sharp. I do not\ncondemn a magistrate who sleeps, provided the people under his charge sleep as well as he: the laws in\nthat case sleep too. For my part, I commend a gliding, staid, and silent life: [ANeither subject and abject,\nnor obtrusive.@ --Cicero, De Offic., i. 34] My fortune will have it so. I am descended from a family that\nhas lived quietly, without bluster or bustle, and always particularly ambitious of a character for probity.\nOur people nowadays are so bred up to bustle and ostentation, that good nature, moderation,\nequability, constancy, and such like quiet and unapparent qualities, are no more thought on or regarded.\nRough bodies make themselves felt; the smooth are imperceptibly handled: sickness is felt, health little or\nnot at all; no more than the oils that soothe us, in comparison of the pains which call for their application.\n'Tis acting for one's particular reputation and profit, not for the public good, to refer that to be done in the\npublic squares which one may do in the council chamber; and to noon day what might have been done the\nnight before; and to be jealous to do that himself which his colleague can do as well as he. So were some\nsurgeons of Greece wont to perform their operations upon scaffolds in the sight of the people, to draw\nmore practice and profit. They think that good rules cannot be understood but by the sound of trumpet.\nAmbition is not a vice of little people, nor of such modest means as ours. One said to Alexander: AYour\nfather will leave you a great dominion, easy and pacific@, but the youth was envious of his father's\nvictories and of the justice of his government; he would not have enjoyed the empire of the world in ease\nand peace. Alcibiades, in Plato, had rather die young, beautiful, rich, noble, and learned rather than live\nin a lesser condition; this disease may be excusable in so strong and so full a soul. When wretched and\n\ndwarfish little souls cajole and deceive themselves, and try to spread their fame for having given right\njudgment in an affair, or maintained the discipline of the guard of a gate of their city, they think to exalt\ntheir heads but only show their buttocks. This petty well-doing has neither body nor life; it vanishes in\nthe first mouth, and goes no further than from one street to another. Talk of it by all means to your son or\nyour servant, like that old fellow who, having no other auditor of his praises nor witness of his valor,\nboasted to his chambermaid, crying, AO Perette, what a brave, clever man hast thou for thy master! AAt\nthe worst, talk of it to yourself, like a councillor of my acquaintance, who, having disgorged a whole\nshipload of law jargon with great heat and as great folly, coming out of the council chamber to make\nwater, was heard muttering devoutly betwixt his teeth: ANot unto us, O Lord, not to us: but unto Thy\nname be the glory.@ He who gets it of nobody else, let him pay himself out of his own purse.\nFame is not prostituted so cheaply. Rare and exemplary actions, to which it is due, would not\nendure the company of this prodigious crowd of petty daily performances. For having repaired a bit of\npublic wall or cleaned a public gutter, marble may exalt your titles as much as you please but not men of\nsense. Renown does not follow all good deeds, if novelty and difficulty be not conjoined; nay, so much\nas mere esteem, according to the Stoics, is not due to every action that proceeds from virtue; nor will they\nallow him bare thanks who, out of self-control, abstains from an old blear-eyed crone. Those who have\nknown the admirable qualities of Scipio Africanus, deny him the glory that Panaetius attributes to him, of\nrefusing gifts, since it was a glory not so much his as of the times in which he lived. We have pleasures\nsuitable to our lot; let us not usurp those of grandeur: our own are more natural, and by so much more\nsolid and sure, as they are lower. If not for that of conscience, yet at least for ambition's sake, let us reject\nambition; let us disdain that thirst of honor and renown, so low and begging that it makes us beg from all\nsorts of people by abject and degrading means. =Tis dishonor to be so honored. Let us learn to be no\nmore hungry for glory than we are capable of it. To be puffed up with every action that is innocent or of\nuse, is only for those with whom such things are extraordinary and rare: they will value it as it costs them.\nThe more a good deed shines, the more do I abate of its goodness as I suspect that it was more performed\nfor the shine than upon account of the goodness: put upon the shop-counter, 'tis half sold. Those actions\nhave much more grace and luster, that slip from the hand of him that does them, negligently and without\nnoise, and that some honest man thereafter picks up and raises from the shade, to produce it to the light\nupon its own account. All things truly seem more laudable to me that are performed without ostentation,\nand without the testimony of the people, says Cicero, the most ostentatious man that ever lived.\n\nI had but to conserve and to continue, which are silent and insensible effects. Innovation\nis of great luster, but 'tis forbidden in this age, when we are pressed upon and have to defend\nourselves mostly from novelties. To forbear doing is often as generous as to do; but 'tis less in\nthe light, and the little good I have in me is of this kind. In short, opportunities in my terms of\noffice fell in with my humor, and I heartily thank them for it. Is there any who desires to be sick,\nthat he may see his physician at work? and would not the physician deserve to be whipped who\nshould wish the plague amongst us, that he might put his art in practice? I have never been of\nthat wicked humor, and common enough, to desire that troubles and disorders in this city should\nelevate and honor my government; I have ever heartily contributed all I could to their tranquillity\nand ease. He who will not thank me for the order, the sweet and silent calm that has accompanied\nmy administration, cannot, however, deprive me of the share that belongs to me by title of my\ngood fortune. And I am of such a composition, that I would as willingly be lucky as wise, and\nhad rather owe my successes purely to the favor of Almighty God, than to any operation of my\nown.\nI had sufficiently published to the world my unfitness for such public offices; but I have\nsomething in me yet worse than incapacity itself; which is, that I am not much displeased at it,\nand that I do not much go about to cure it, considering the course of life that I have proposed to\nmyself. Neither have I satisfied myself in this employment; but I have very near arrived at what I\nexpected from my own performance, and have much surpassed what I promised them with whom\nI had to do: for I am apt to promise something less than what I am able to do, and than what I\nhope to make good. I assure myself that I have left no offence or hatred behind me; to leave\nregret or desire for me amongst them, I at least know very well that I never much aimed at it:\n[AShould I place confidence in this monster? Should I be ignorant of the dangers of that seeming\nplacid sea, those now quiet waves?@ --Virgil, Aeneid, V. 849.]"

Text: Original translation in the public domain.\nTHE ESSAYS OF MONTAIGNE\nAdapted from the Cotton translation by A.C. Kibel\nLecture #4 - OF Experience\nTHERE is no desire more natural than that of knowledge. We try all ways that can lead us to it; where\nreason fails, we use experience,\nExperience, by example led\nBy varied trials art has bred Manilius\nwhich is a weaker and less dignified means. But truth is so great thing that we ought not to scorn any\nmedium that will guide us to it. Reason has so many forms, that we know not to which to take; experience\nhas no fewer; the consequence we would draw from the likeness of events is unsure, because they are\nalways also unlike. There is no quality so universal in the aspect of things as diversity and variety. Both\nthe Greeks and the Latins, and we usually refer to eggs for a model of likeness: and yet there have been\nmen, particularly one at Delphos, who could distinguish marks of difference among eggs so well that he\nnever mistook one for another; and could tell which among his many hens had laid it. Dissimilitude\nintrudes itself of itself in our works; no art can arrive at perfect similitude: neither Perrozet, nor any other\ncard-maker, can so carefully polish and blanch the backs of his cards that some gamesters will not\ndistinguish them by seeing them even as they are shufflled by another. Resemblance does not so much\nmake things one as difference makes them two. Nature has obliged herself to make nothing separate that\nwas not different.\nAnd so I am not much pleased with the opinion of the man who thought by the multitude of laws\nto curb the authority of judges, in cutting up their meat for them; he was not aware that there is as much\nliberty and latitude in the interpretation of laws as in their form; and they but fool themselves who think\nto lessen and stop our disputes by recalling us to the express words of the Bible: for our mind finds the\nfield no less spacious for converting the sense of another=s words than to produce our own. As if there\nwere less controversy and bitterness in commenting than in inventing! We see how much he was\nmistaken; for we have more laws in France than all the rest of the world put together, and more than\nwould be necessary for the government of all the worlds of Epicurus: As we used to suffer from crimes,\nnow we suffer from laws [Tacitus]. And yet we have left so much to the opinions and decisions of our\njudges, that there never was so much liberty or icense. What have our legislators gained by selecting a\nhundred thousand particular cases and applying to them a hundred thousand laws? This number bears no\nproportion to the infinite diversity of human actions; the multiplication of our inventions will never arrive\nat the variety of examples; add to our inventions a hundred times as many more, it will still not happen,\nthat of events to come, there shall one be found that, in this vast number of millions of events so chosen\nand recorded, shall so tally with any other one, and be so exactly coupled and matched with it that there\n\nwill not remain some difference that will require separate consideration and judgment. There is little\nrelation between our actions, which are in perpetual mutation, and fixed and immutable laws. The most\ndesirable laws are those that are the most rare, most simple and general: and I am even of opinion, that we\nhad better have none at all than to have them in such numbers as we have.\nNature always gives us better and happier than those we make ourselves. Witness the picture of\nthe Golden Age of the poets and the state in we see nations live who have no other laws. Some peoples\nthere are who take for their only judge the first passer-by that travels along their mountains to settle their\nquarrels: and others who on their market day choose some one among them to decide their controversies\non the spot. What would be the danger in having the wisest among us to determine ours according to\noccurrences and at sight without worrying about precedents, past and future? For every foot, its own\nshoe. King Ferdinand, sending colonies to the Indies, wisely provided that they should not carry along\nwith them any students of the law for fear lest lawsuits should get footing in that new world, the science\nof law being naturally the mother of altercation and division: judging with Plato, Athat lawyers and\nphysicians are the pests of a country.@\nWhy does our common language, so easy for all other uses, become obscure, and unintelligible in\nwills and contracts? and why is a man who clearly expresses himself in whatever else he speaks or writes\nunable to find any way of declaring himself in such things that does not fall into doubt and contradiction?\nif it be not that the princes of that art, applying themselves with a peculiar attention to select portentous\nwords and to contrive artificial sentences, have so weighed every syllable, and so thoroughly sifted every\nsort of quirking connection, that they are now confounded and intangled in an infinity of figures and\nminute divisions, and can no more fall within any rule or prescription, nor any certain interpretation: What\nis pulverized to dust becomes confusion [Seneca]. As you see children trying to divide a mass of\nquicksilver to stable of parts; the more they press and work it, and try to constrain it to their will, the more\nthey provoke the liberty of this spirited metal; it evades their efforts and sprinkles itself into so many\nseparate bodies as frustrate all reckoning. The law is the same; for in subdividing these subtleties, we\nteach men to increase their doubts; they put us into a way of extending and diversifying difficulties and\nlengthen and disperse them. In sowing and harvesting questions, they make the world fruitful and increase\nin uncertainties and disputes, as soil is made fertile by being crumbled and dug deep: Learning makes\ndifficulties [Quintillian] We were puzzled by Ulpian and are now more baffled by Bartolus and Baldus.\nWe should efface the traces of this innumerable diversity of opinions; not adorn ourselves with them and\ncram them into the heads of posterity.\nI know not what to say about it; but experience makes it manifest that so many interpretations\ndisperse truth and break it. Aristotle wrote to be understood; if he could not do this, much less will\nsomeone less able and not expressing his own ideas. We open the matter and spill it in pouring out: of\none subject we make a thousand and in multiplying and subdividing them, fall into the infinity of atoms\nof Epicurus. Never did two men make the same judgment of the same thing; and it is impossible to find\ntwo opinions exactly alike, not only in several men, but in the same man at different hours. I often find\nmatter of doubt in things of which the commentary has disdained to take notice; I am most apt to trip on a\nflat surface, like some horses that I have known that stumble most often on a smooth road.\nWho would not say that commentary augments doubts and ignorance? since there=s no book to\nbe found, either human or divine, which the world busies itself with, whose difficulties are cleared by\ninterpretation. The hundredth commentator passes it on to the next, still more knotty and perplexing than\nhe found it. When were we ever agreed among ourselves: Athis book has enough; there is now no more to\nbe said about it?@ This is most apparent in the law; we give the authority of law to infinite commentary,\ninfinite decisions, and as many interpretations: yet do we find any end of the need of interpreting? Is\nthere, for all that, any progress or advancement toward peace, or do we stand in need of any fewer\nlawyers and judges than when this great mass of law was still in its first infancy? On the contrary, we\n\ndarken and bury meaning; we can no longer discover it, but at the mercy of so many fences and barriers.\nMen do not know the natural disease of the mind; it does nothing but ferret and inquire, and is eternally\nwheeling, juggling, and perplexing itself like silkworms, and then suffocates itself in its work, like a\nmouse in a tar-barrel [Erasmus]. It thinks it sees some glimpse light at a great distance, but encounters so\nmany difficulties, obstacles and new questions while running towards it that it loses its way, bewildered:\nnot much unlike Aesop=s dogs, that seeing something like a dead body floating in the sea and not being\nable to approach it, set to work to drink the water and lay the passage dry, and so choked themselves. To\nwhich, what one Crates said of the writings of Heraclitus, falls pat enough, Athat they required a reader\nwho could swim well,@ so that the depth and weight of his doctrine might not overwhelm and drown him.\nIt is just particular weakness that makes us content with what others or ourselves have found out\nin this chase after knowledge. One of better understanding will not rest so content. There is always room\nfor another to follow, nay, even for ourselves; and another road: there is no end of our researches; our end\nis in the other world. It is a sign either that the mind has grown short-sighted when it is satisfied or that it\nhas got weary. No spirited mind can stop by itself; it will always pushing further on, and beyond its\nstrength; it sallies beyond its powers; if it does not advance and press forward, and then retreat, and rush\nand wheel about, it is but half alive: its pursuits are without bound or method; its food is wonder, the\nchase, ambiguity. Apollo revealed this clearly in always speaking to us in a double, obscure, and oblique\nsense; not satisfying us but keeping us teased and puzzled. It is an irregular and perpetual motion,\nwithout model and without aim; its inventions excite, pursue, and produce one another. There is more fuss\nin interpreting interpretations than interpreting things, and more books upon books than upon any other\nsubject. We do nothing but comment upon one another. Every place swarms with commentaries; of\nauthors there is great scarcity. Is it not the principal and most reputed learning of our times to learn to\nunderstand the learned? Is it not the common and final end of all studies? Our opinions are grafted upon\none another; the first serves as a stock to the second, the second to the third, and so forth; thus step by\nstep we climb the ladder. And so it comes to pass that he who is mounted highest, has often more honor\nthan merit, for he is got up but an inch upon the shoulders of the last but one.\nHow often, and perhaps how stupidly have I extended my book to make it speak of itself!\nstupidly, if only for this reason, that it should remind me of what I say of others who do the same; that the\nfrequent amorous glances they cast upon their work show that their hearts pant with self-love; and that\neven the disdainful roughness with which they beat it are just the love-taps and caresses of maternal\naffection; as Aristotle, whose valuing and undervaluing himself often springs from the same sort of\narrogance. My own excuse is, that I ought in this to have more liberty than others, that since I write\nspecifically of myself and my actions, I must write of my writings; that my theme turns upon itself; but I\nknow not whether others will accept this excuse.\nI have observed that in Germany has raised in others as many and even more doubts, divisions\nand disputes about his opinions than he himself raised about the Holy Scriptures. Our contest is verbal: I\nask what Anature@ is, what Apleasure@, Acircle@ and Asubstitution@? the question is about words, and is\nanswered in words. AA stone is a body@.\nBut if a man should further ask: AAnd what is a\nbody?@BASubstance.@BAAnd what is substance?@ and so on, he would drive the respondent to the end of\nhis dictionary. We exchange one word for another, and often for one less understood. I better know what\nman is, than I know what is animal, mortal, and rational; to satisfy one doubt, they pop me in the ear with\nthree. It is the Hydra's head. Socrates asked Menon, AWhat virtue was.@ AThere is,@ says Menon, Athe\nvirtue of a man and of a woman, of a magistrate and of a private person, of an old man and of a child.@\nAVery fine,@ cried Socrates, Awe were looking for one virtue, and you find a whole swarm.@ We put one\nquestion, and they return us a hive of them. As no event, no face, entirely resembles another, so do they\nnot entirely differ: an ingenious mixture on the part of nature. If our faces were not alike, we couldn=t tell\nhumans from animals; if they were not unlike, we could tell one person from another. Any two things can\nbe united by some similarity; every example limps and the relation which is drawn from experience is\nalways faulty and imperfect. We can nonetheless always find a corner to staple a comparison of two\n\nthings together. So do the laws serve, and are fitted to every one of our affairs, by some wrested, biased,\nand forced interpretation.\nSince ethical laws, which concern the particular duty of every one in oneself, are so hard to be\nframed, as we see they are, it is no wonder if those which govern so many individuals are much more so.\nJust consider the form of this justice that governs us; it is a true testimony of human weakness, so full is it\nof error and contradiction. What we find to be leniency and severity in justiceBand we find so much of\nthem both, that I know not whether the medium between is often met withBare sickly and unjust members\nof the very body and essence of justice. Some peasants have run in to tell me that they have just left in a\nforest of mine a man with a hundred wounds upon him, who was still breathing and who begged them\nwater for pity's sake to give him water and carry him to some place of relief; they tell me they dared not\ngo near him, but have run away, lest the officers of justice should catch them there, and, as happens to\nthose found near a murdered person, they should be charged with this accident, to their utter ruin, having\nneither money nor friends to defend their innocence. What could I have said to these people? it is certain\nthat this office of humanity would have brought them into trouble.\nHow many innocent people have we known that have been punished, and this without the judge's\nfault; and how many that have not arrived at our knowledge? This happened in my time: certain men were\ncondemned to die for a murder committed: their sentence, if not pronounced, at least determined and\nconcluded on. The judges, just in the nick, are informed by the officers of an inferior court hard by, that\nthey have some men in custody, who have directly confessed the murder, and made an indubitable\ndiscovery of all the particulars of the fact. Yet it was gravely deliberated whether or not they ought to\nsuspend the execution of the sentence already passed upon the first accused: they considered the novelty\nof the example judicially, and the consequence of reversing judgments; that the sentence was passed, and\nthe judges deprived of repentance; and in the result, the poor devils were sacrificed by the forms of\njustice. Philip, or some other, provided against a like inconvenience, after this manner. He had\ncondemned a man in a great fine toward another by an absolute judgement. The truth some time after\nbeing discovered, he found that he had passed an unjust sentence. On one side was the reason of the\ncause; on the other side, the reason of the judicial forms: he in some sort satisfied both, leaving the\nsentence in the state it was, and out of his own purse recompensing the condemned party. But he had to\ndo with a reparable affair; my men were irreparably hanged. How many condemnations have I seen, more\ncriminal than the crimes themselves?\nAll which makes me remember the ancient opinions AThat it is of necessity a man must do wrong\nby retail, who will do right in gross; and injustice in little things, who would come to do justice in great:\nthat human justice is formed after the model of physic, according to which, all that is useful is also just\nand honest; and of what is held by the Stoics, that Nature herself proceeds contrary to justice in most of\nher works: and of what is received by the Cyrenaics, that there is nothing just of itself, but that customs\nand laws make justice: and what the Theodorians held, that theft, sacrilege, and all sorts of uncleanness,\nare just in a sage, if he knows them to be profitable to him.@ There is no remedy: I am in the same case\nthat Alcibiades was, that I will never, if I can help it, put myself into the hands of a man who may\ndetermine as to my head; where my life and honor shall more depend upon the skill and diligence of my\nattorney than on my own innocence. I would venture myself with such justice as would take notice of my\ngood deeds, as well as my ill; where I had as much to hope as to fear: indemnity is not sufficient pay to a\nman who does better than not to do amiss. Our justice presents to us but one hand, and that the left hand,\ntoo; let him be who be may, he may, be shall be sure to come off with loss.\nIn China, of which kingdom the government and arts, without commerce with, or knowledge of\nours, surpass our examples in several excellent features, and of which the history teaches me how much\ngreater and more various the world is than either the ancients or we have been able to penetrate, the\noffices deputed by the prince to visit the state, of his provinces, as they punish those who behave\n\nthemselves ill in their charge, so do they liberally reward those who have conducted themselves better\nthan the common sort, and beyond the necessity of their duty; these there present themselves, not only to\nbe approved but to get; not simply to be paid, but to have a present made to them.\nNo judge, thank God, has ever yet spoken to me in the quality of a judge, upon any account\nwhatever, whether my own or that of another, whether criminal or civil; nor no prison has ever received\nme, not even as a visitor. Imagination renders the very outside of a jail displeasing to me; I am so\nenamored of liberty, that should I be interdicted the remotest corner of the Indies, I should live a little less\nat my ease; and while I can find earth or air open in any other part of the world, I shall never lurk in any\nplace where I must hide myself. Good God! how ill should I endure the condition wherein I see so many\npeople, nailed to a corner of the kingdom, deprived of the right to enter the principal cities and courts, and\nthe liberty of the public roads, for having quarreled with our laws. If those under which I live should but\nwag a finger at me by way of menace, I would immediately go seek out others, let them be where they\nwould. All my little prudence in the civil wars wherein we are now engaged, is employed that they may\nnot hinder my liberty of coming and going.\nNow, the laws keep up their credit, not for being just, but because they are laws; it is the mystic\nfoundation of their authority; they have no other, and it well answers their purpose. They are often made\nby fools, still oftener by men who, out of hatred to equality, fail in equity; but always by men, vain and\nirresolute authors. There is nothing so much, nor so grossly, nor so ordinarily faulty, as the laws.\nWhoever obeys them because they are just, does not justly obey them as he ought. Our French laws, by\ntheir irregularity and deformity, lend, in some sort, a helping hand to the disorder and corruption that all\nmanifest in their dispensation and execution; the command is so perplexed and inconstant, that it in some\nsort excuses alike disobedience, and defect in the interpretation, the administration and the observation of\nit. What fruit, then, soever we may extract from experience, that will little advantage our institution,\nwhich we draw from foreign examples, if we make so little profit of that we have of our own, which is\nmore familiar to us, and, doubtless, sufficient to instruct us in that whereof we have need.\nI study myself more than any other subject; it is my metaphysics, it is my physics.\nBy what art God controls our home, the world\nWhere the moon rises, where she sets, how shrinks\nHer horns together monthly, and again grows full\nFrom what quarter come the winds that rule the sea,\nWhere Eureus=s blast holds sway; wht the source of rain\nThat ever fills the clouds; whether some day\nThe citadels of the world will pass away\nPropertius\nInqure, you who the laboring world survey\nLucan\nIn this universe of things I suffer myself to be ignorantly and negligently led by the general law of the\nworld; I shall know it well enough when I feel it; my learning cannot make it alter its course; it will not\nchange itself for me; it is folly to hope it, and a greater folly to worry about it, seeing it is necessarily\nuniform, public and common. The goodness and capacity of the governor ought absolutely to discharge us\nof all care of the government.\nPhilosophical inquiries and contemplations serve only to increase our curiosity. The philosophers,\nwith great reason, allude to the rules of nature; but they have nothing to do with so sublime a knowledge;\nthey falsify them, and present us her face painted with too high and too adulterated a complexion, whence\nspring so many different pictures of so uniform a subject. As she has given us feet to walk with, she given\nus wisdom to guide us through life; not so ingenious, robust, and pompous a wisdom as that of their\n\ninvention; but yet one that is easy, quiet, and salutary, performing very well performs the other only\npromises, in anyone with the good luck to know how to live sincerely and regularly, that is to say,\naccording to nature. The more simply we trust in nature, the more wisely. Oh, what a soft, easy, and\nhealthy a pillow is ignorance and incuriosity, to rest a well-made head!\nI had rather understand myself well in studying myself than in studying Cicero. Of the experience\nI have of myself, I find enough to make me wise, if I were but a good scholar. Whoever calls to mind the\nexcess of his past anger and how far that fever transported him will see the ugliness of this passion better\nthan in Aristotle and will hate it more justly. Whoever remembers the evils he has suffered, those that\nhave threatened him, and the slight events that have changed him from one state to another prepares\nhimself for future changes and for the knowledge of his condition. The life of Caesar offers no better\nexample to us than our own: whether ordinary or an Emperor=s, it is still a life subject to all human\naccidents. Let us but listen to it; we will tell ourselves all we really need. Whoever recalls how many,\nmany times he has been mistaken in his own judgment is a great fool if he does not distrust it ever after.\nWhen I find myself convicted of a false opinion by another man=s argument, I do not so much learn what\nis new, and my ignorance on that pointBthis would be no great acquisitionBas I learn my weakness in\ngeneral and the treachery of my understanding, whence I derive reformation of the whole mass. In all my\nother errors, I do the same, and find from this rule great utility to life: I regard not the species and\nindividual as a stone I have tripped over, but I learn to suspect my walking throughout and am careful to\nregulate it. To learn that we have said or done something foolish is nothing; we must learn that we are\nnothing but fools, a much more ample and important instruction. The false steps that my memory has so\noften made, even when it was most secure and confident of itself, are not idly thrown away; memory may\nnow swear to me and assure me as much as it will, I shake my ears, and dare not trust it; the first\nopposition to its testimony makes me pause and I dare not rely upon it in anything important nor trust it in\nanother person's affairs. And were it not that what I do for lapse of memory, others do still more often for\nlapse of good faith, I should always choose to take the truth from another's mouth, than from my own. If\nevery one would pry into the effects and circumstances of the passions that sway him as I have done into\nthose which I am most subject to, he would see them coming and would a little break their impetuosity\nand career. They do not always suddenly seize us by the throat; there is threatening and degrees:\nAs when a rising wind makes white waves fly,\nThe se heaves slowly, raising billows high,\nAnd surges from the depths to meet the sky.\nVirgil\nJudgment holds in me a magisterial seat; at least it carefully trys to. It lets my feelings take their\nown course, hatred and friendship, even the friendship that I have with myself, without being changed or\ncorrupted by them. If it cannot reform the other parts according to its own model, at least it does not\ndeform itself according to theirs, it plays its game apart.\nThat advice to every one, Ato know themselves,@ should have an important effect, since the god\nof wisdom and light caused it to be written on the front of his temple, as comprehending all he had to\nadvise us. Plato says also, that wisdom is nothing but the execution of this command; and Socrates\nminutely verifies it in Xenophon. The difficulties and obscurity in any science are seen only by those who\nare go into it; for a certain degree of intelligence is required to enable a man to know that he does not\nknow: we must push against a door to know that it is bolted against us. Whence this Platonic subtlety\nsprings, that Athose who know do not have to ask, because they know already, and those who do not\nknow cannot ask, because they do not know what to ask for.@ So in this matter of knowing oneself, the\nfact that everyone is self-assured and self-satisfied that he understands himself signifies that everyone\nknows nothing about the matter; as Socrates teaches Euthydemus in Xenophon.\n\nI, who profess nothing else, find so infinite a depth and variety in me that all the fruit I have\nreaped from what I have learned serves only to make me sensible how much more I have to learn. To my\nweakness, so often admitted, I owe my inclination to be modest, to obey the belief prescribed me, to be\nmoderate and cool in my opinions, and to hatre that troublesome and quarreling arrogance that wholly\nbelieves and trusts in itself, the capital enemy of discipline and truth. Hear them laying down the law; the\nfirst stupid things they utter it is in the style of prophets and legislators. Nothing is more shameful than to\nassert and acquiesce before understanding [Cicero] Aristarchus said, that anciently there were scarce\nseven sages to be found in the world; and in his time scarce so many fools; have not we more reason to\nsay so in this age of ours? Affirmation and obstinacy are express signs of stupidity. A fellow has stumbled\nand knocked his nose against the ground a hundred times in a day, and yet he stands on his Atherefore=s@\nas resolute and sturdy as before; so that one would conclude that someone had since infused with soul and\nintellectual vigor, and that he was like that ancient son of the earth, who took fresh courage and strength\nby his fall:\nWhose limbs, however tired,\nBy touching Mother Earth, with energy were fired.\nLucan\nDoes this incorrigible coxcomb think that he picks up a new mind when he picks up a new argument? It\nis by my own experience that I accuse human ignorance, which is the surest part of the world's school, in\nmy opinion. Such as will not conclude their ignorance by so vain an example as mine or theirs, let them\nbelieve it from Socrates, the master of masters; for the philosopher Antisthenes, said to his disciples, ALet\nus go and hear Socrates: I will be a pupil with you;@ and, maintaining this doctrine of the Stoic sect, that\nvirtue was sufficient to make a life completely happy, having no need of any other thing whatever, he\nwould add Aexcept of the strength of Socrates@.\nThe long attention that I employ in considering myself also fits me to judge tolerably of others;\nand there are few things whereof I speak better and with better excuse. I happen very often more exactly\nto see and distinguish the qualities of my friends than they do themselves; I have astonished some with\nthe pertinence of my description, and have informed them about themselves. By having from my youth up\ntrained myself to see my own life mirrored in the lives of others, I have acquired a bent to study those\naround me in that way; and when I am once intent upon it, I let few things escape me, whether\ncountenances, humors, or discourses, that serve to that purpose. I study all, both what I am to flee and\nwhat I am to follow. So from the outward manifestations of my friends I discover their inward natures.\nBut I do not try to arrange this infinite variety of so diverse and unconnected actions into species\nand categories, distributing my parcels and divisions under known heads and classes. The scholars divide\nand mark off their ideas more specifically and in detail; I, who see no further into things than as use\ninforms me, present mine without system, in a general way and tentatively. As in this: I pronounce my\nopinion by disjointed articles, as a thing that cannot be spoken at once in a lump: low, commonplace\nminds like ours cannot connect and relate. Wisdom is a solid and entire building, of which every piece\nkeeps its place and bears its mark; Wisdom alone is wholly directed towards itself [Cicero]. I leave it to\nartists, and I know not whether they will bring it about, in so perplexed, minute, and fortuitous a thing, to\nmarshal into bands this infinite diversity of faces, to settle our inconstancy, and set it in order. I do not\nonly find it hard to piece our actions to one another, but I, moreover, find it hard properly to designate\neach itself by any principal quality, so ambiguous and variform they are, when seen in different light.\nWhat is remarked as rare in Perseus, king of Macedon, that his mind fixing itself to no one\ncondition, wandered into all sorts of living and represented so wild and vagabond a character that neither\nhe nor anyone else knew what kind of man he was, seems to fit nearly everybody, in my opinion; and,\nespecially, I have seen another king since, to whom I think this conclusion might more properly be\n\napplied; no moderate in-between, still running headlong from one extreme to another at moments not to\nbe guessed at; no line of path without turning and shifting direction; no one quality simple and unmixed;\nso that the best portrait of him will ultimately be that he affected and studied to make himself known by\nbeing unknowable. A man has need of sound ears to hear himself frankly criticized; and as there are few\nwho can to hear it without being stung, those who venture to criticize us show a singular act of friendship;\nfor it is to love sincerely indeed to try to wound and offend us for our own good. I think it a harsh\nbusiness to judge a man whose ill qualities are more than his good ones: Plato requires three things in him\nwho will examine the soul of another: knowledge, benevolence, boldness.\nI was once asked what I should have thought myself fit for, had any one designed to make use of\nme in my younger years;\nWhile better blood gave strength, before the snows\nOf envious age were sprinkled on my brows.\nVirgil\nAFor nothing,@ said I; and I am very willing to excuse myself by profess that I do not know how to do\nanything that would enslave me to another. But I had told the truth to that master of mine, and had\nwatched over his conduct if he had so pleased; not in general, by scholarly lessons, which I understand\nnot, and from which I see no true reformation spring in those that do; but by observing it on occasion, at\nall opportunities, and simply and naturally judging them as an eyewitness, distinctly one by one; giving\nhim to how he stood in everyday opinion and not in the words of flatterers. There is none of us who\nwould not be worse than kings, if so continually corrupted as they are by those rascals; and we see that\nAlexander, that great king and philosopher, could not defend himself from them. I should have had\nfidelity, judgment, and freedom enough for that purpose. It would be a nameless office, otherwise it\nwould lose its grace and its effect; and it is not a suitable role for all men: for truth itself does not have the\nprivilege to be spoken at all times and indiscriminately: its use, noble as it is, has its circumscriptions and\nlimits. It often falls out, as the world goes, that a man lets truth slip into the ear of a prince not only to no\npurpose, but moreover injuriously and unjustly; and no man shall make me believe that a virtuous\nremonstrance may not be viciously applied, and that the interest of the substance must not often give way\nto the interest of the form.\nFor such a purpose, I would have a man who is content with his own fortune, Who would be what\nhe is, and nothing else prefers [Martial], and of moderate status; because, on the one hand, he would not\nbe afraid to touch his master's heart to the quick, for fear of losing his preferment and, on the other hand,\nbeing of middle station, he would have easy communication with all sorts of people. I would have this\noffice limited to only one person; for to allow the privilege of this liberty and privacy to many, would\nbeget an inconvenient irreverence; and of that one, I would above all things require the fidelity of silence.\nA king is not to be believed, when he brags of his constancy in standing the shock of the enemy\nfor his glory, if, for his profit and amendment, he cannot stand the liberty of a friend's advice, which has\nno other power but to pinch his ear, the remainder of its effect being still in his own hands. Now, there is\nno condition of men whatever who stand in so great need of true and free advice and warning as kings;\nthey sustain a public life, and have to satisfy the opinion of so many spectators that, as those about them\nconceal from them whatever should hinder their own plans, they insensibly find themselves involved in\nthe hatred and detestation of their people, often upon occasions which they might have avoided without\nany loss to themselves, had they been advised and set right in time. Their favorites commonly have more\nregard to themselves than to their master; and indeed this serves them well, since most offices of real\nfriendship are hard and dangerous when applied to the sovereign, so that they require not only much\naffection and freedom but also great courage.\n\nAt the end of the day, all this hodge-podge I scribble here is nothing but a record of the essays of\nmy life, which, for the internal soundness, is instructive enough, if you take its example in reverse; but as\nto bodily health, no man can offer more profitable experience than I, who present it pure, and no way\ncorrupted and changed by art or opinion. Experience is properly upon its own shit-heap in the subject of\nmedicine, where reason wholly gives way to it. Tiberius said that whoever had lived twenty years ought\nto be responsible to himself for all things that were hurtful or beneficial and know how to order himself\nwithout medical advice; and he might have learned this from Socrates, who, advising his disciples to be\nsolicitous of their health as a chief study, added that it was hard for a man of sense, having a care to his\nexercise and diet, not to know better than a doctor what was good or ill for him. And medicine itself\nprofesses always to take experience as the test of its operations; so Plato was right to say that to become a\ngood physician, one should first have experienced all the diseases one pretends to cure, and through all\nthe accidents and circumstances he is to diagnose. It is but reason they should get the pox, if they would\ntreat it. For my part, I should put myself into such hands; the others but guide us, like him who paints\nseas and rocks and ports sitting at table, and there makes the model of a ship sailing in all security; but put\nhim to the real thing, he knows not at which end to begin. Doctors make such a description of our\ndiseases as a town-crier does of a lost horse or dogBsuch a color, such a height, such an earBbut bring it\nto him, and he knows it not, for all that. If medicine should one day give me some good and visible relief,\nthen, truly, I will cry out in good earnest: At last I yield to an efficient science [Horace].\nThe arts that promise to keep our bodies and souls in health promise a great deal; but, withal,\nthere are none that keep their promise less. And, in our time, those who profess medicine less manifest the\nresults than any other sort of men; one may say of them, at the most, that they sell medicinal drugs but not\nthat they are physicians. I have lived long enough to be able to give an account of the custom that has\ncarried me so far; for him who has a mind to try it, I have made the experiment as his taster. Here are\nsome of the items, as my memory shall supply me with them; I have no habit that has not varied\naccording to circumstances; but I only record those that I have been best acquainted with, and that\nhitherto have had the greatest possession of me.\n==================================\nMy form of life is the same in sickness as in health; the same bed, the same hours, the same meat,\nand even the same drink, serve me in both conditions alike; I add nothing to them but the moderation of\nmore or less, according to my strength and appetite. My health is, to maintain my wonted state without\ndisturbance. I see that sickness puts me off it on one side, and if I will be ruled by the physicians, they\nwill put me off on the other; so that by fortune and by art I am out of my way. I believe nothing more\ncertainly than this, that I cannot be hurt by the use of things to which I have been so long accustomed. it is\nfor custom to give a form to a man's life, such as it pleases him; she is all in all in that: it is the beverage\nof Circe, that varies our nature as she best pleases. How many nations, and but three steps from us, think\nthe fear of the night-dew, that so manifestly is hurtful to us, a ridiculous fancy; and our own watermen\nand peasants laugh at it. You make a German sick if you lay him upon a mattress, as you do an Italian if\nyou lay him on a featherbed; and a Frenchman, if without curtains or fire. A Spanish stomach cannot hold\nout to eat as we can; nor ours to drink like the Swiss. A German made me very merry at Augsburg, by\nfinding fault with our hearths, by the same arguments which we commonly make use of in decrying their\nstoves: for, to say the truth, the smothered heat, and then the smell of that heated matter of which the fire\nis composed, very much offend such as are not used to them; not me; and, indeed, the heat being always\nequal, constant and universal, without flame, without smoke, and without the wind that comes down our\nchimney, they may many ways sustain comparison with ours. Why do we not imitate the Roman\narchitecture? for they say that anciently fires were not made in the houses, but on the outside, and at the\nfoot of them, whence the heat was conveyed to the whole fabric by pipes contrived in the wall, which\nwere drawn twining about the rooms that were to be warmed: which I have seen plainly described\nsomewhere in Seneca. This German hearing me commend the conveniences and beauties of this city,\nwhich truly deserves it, began to compassionate me that I had to leave it; and the first inconvenience he\nalleged to me was, the heaviness of head that the chimneys elsewhere would bring upon me. He had heard\n\nsome one make this complaint, and fixed it upon us, being by custom deprived of the means of perceiving\nit at home. All heat that comes from the fire weakens and dulls me; and yet Evenus said, that fire was the\nbest condiment of life: I rather choose any other way of making myself warm.\nWe are afraid to drink our wines, when toward the bottom of the cask; in Portugal those fumes\nare reputed delicious, and it is the beverage of princes. In short, every nation has many customs and\nusages that are not only unknown to other nations, but savage and miraculous in their sight. What should\nwe do with those people who admit of no evidence that is not in print, who believe not men if they are not\nin a book, nor truth, if it be not of competent age? we dignify our fopperies, when we commit them to the\npress: it is of a great deal more weight to say, AI have read such a thing,@ than if you only say, AI have\nheard such a thing.@ But I, who no more disbelieve a man's mouth than his pen, and who know that men\nwrite as indiscreetly as they speak, and who look upon this age as one that is past, as soon quote a friend\nas Aulus Gellius or Macrobius; and what I have seen, as what they have written. And, as it is held of\nvirtue, that it is not greater for having continued longer, so do I hold of the truth, that for being older it is\nnone the wiser. I often say that it is mere folly that makes us run after foreign and scholastic examples;\ntheir fertility is the same now that it was in the time of Homer and Plato. But is it not that we seek more\nhonor from the quotation, than from the truth of the matter in hand? As if it were more to the purpose, to\nborrow our proofs from the shops of Vascosan or Plantin, than from what is to be seen in our own village;\nor else, indeed, that we have not the wit to cull out and make useful what we see before us, and to judge\nof it clearly enough to draw it into example; for if we say that we want authority to give faith to our\ntestimony, we speak from the purpose; forasmuch as, in my opinion, of the most ordinary, common, and\nknown things, could we but find out their light, the greatest miracles of nature might be formed, and the\nmost wonderful example, especially upon the subject of human actions.\nNow, upon this subject, setting aside the examples I have gathered from books, and what\nAristotle says of Andron the Argian, that he traveled over the arid sands of Lybia without drinking: a\ngentleman, who has very well behaved himself in several employments, said, in a place where I was, that\nhe had ridden from Madrid to Lisbon, in the heat of summer, without any drink at all. He is very healthful\nand vigorous for his age, and has nothing extraordinary in the use of his life, but this, to live sometimes\ntwo or three months, nay, a whole year, as he has told me, without drinking. He is sometimes thirsty, but\nhe lets it pass over, and he holds that it is an appetite which easily goes off of itself; and he drinks more\nout of caprice than either for need or pleasure.\nHere is another example: it is not long ago that I found one of the learnedest men in France, and a\nman of considerable fortune, studying in a corner of a hall that they had separated for him with tapestry,\nand about him a rabble of his servants making all sorts of noise and confusion. He told me, and Seneca\nalmost says the same of himself, he made an advantage of this uproar; that, beaten with this rattle, he so\nmuch the more collected and retired himself into himself for contemplation, and that this tempest of\nvoices repercussed his thoughts within himself; when a student at Padua, he had his study so long situated\namid the rattle of coaches and the tumult of the square, that he not only formed himself to the contempt,\nbut even to the use of noise, for the service of his studies. Socrates answered Alcibiades, who was\nastonished how he could endure the perpetual scolding of his wife, AWhy,@ said he, Aas those do who are\naccustomed to the ordinary noise of wheels drawing water.@ I am quite otherwise; I have a tender head\nand easily discomposed; when it is bent upon anything, the least buzzing of a fly tears it into pieces.\nSeneca in his youth having, by the example of Sextius, put on a positive resolution of eating\nnothing that had had life, and for a whole year dispensed with animal food, and, as he said, with pleasure:\nonly left off, that he might not be suspected of taking up this rule from some new religion by which it was\nprescribed: he adopted, in like manner, from the precepts of Attalus a custom not to lie upon any sort of\nbedding that gave way under his weight, and, even to his old age, made use of such as would not yield to\nany pressure. What the usage of his time made him account roughness, that of ours makes us look upon as\n\neffeminacy.\nDo but observe the difference between the way of living of my laborers and my own; the\nScythians and Indians have nothing more remote both from my capacity and my manners. I have picked\nup boys from begging, to serve me: who soon after have quitted both my kitchen and livery, only that\nthey might return to their former course of life; and I found one afterward, picking mussels out of the\nsewer for his dinner, whom I could neither by entreaties nor threats reclaim from the sweetness he found\nin indigence. Beggars have their magnificences and delights, as well as the rich, and, it is said, their\ndignities and polities. These are effects of custom; she can mold us, not only into what form she pleases\n(the sages say we ought to apply ourselves to the best, which she will soon make easy to us), but also to\nchange and variation, which is the most noble and most useful instruction of all she teaches us. The best\nof my bodily conditions is that I am flexible and not very obstinate: I have inclinations more my own and\nordinary, and more agreeable than others; but I am diverted from them with very little ado, and easily slip\ninto a contrary course. A young man ought to cross his own rules, to awaken his vigor and to keep it from\ngrowing faint and rusty; and there is no course of life so weak and sottish, as that which is carried on by\nrule and discipline;\nAAd primum lapidem vectari quum placet, hora Sumitur ex libro; si prurit frictus ocelli\nAngulus, inspecta genesi, collyria\nquaerit;@\nhe shall often throw himself even into excesses, if he will take my advice; otherwise the least\ndebauch will destroy him, and render him troublesome and disagreeable in company. The worst quality in\na well-bred man is over fastidiousness, and an obligation to a certain particular way; and it is particular, if\nnot pliable and supple. It is a kind of reproach, not to be able, or not to dare, to do what we see those\nabout us do; let such as these stop at home. It is in every man unbecoming, but in a soldier vicious and\nintolerable; who, as Philopoemen said, ought to accustom himself to every variety and inequality of life.\nThough I have been brought up, as much as was possible, to liberty and independence, yet so it is\nthat, growing old, and having by indifference more settled upon certain forms (my age is now past\ninstruction, and has henceforward nothing to do but to keep itself up as well as it can), custom has\nalready, ere I was aware, so imprinted its character in me, in certain things, that I look upon it as a kind of\nexcess to leave them off; and, without a force upon myself, cannot sleep in the day-time, nor eat between\nmeals, nor breakfast, nor go to bed, without a great interval between eating and sleeping, as of three hours\nafter supper; nor get children but before I sleep, nor standing upon my feet; nor endure my own sweat; nor\nquench my thirst either with pure water or pure wine; nor keep my head long bare, nor cut my hair after\ndinner; and I should be as uneasy without my gloves as without my shirt, or without washing when I rise\nfrom table or out of my bed; and I could not lie without a canopy and curtains, as if they were essential\nthings. I could dine without a tablecloth, but without a clean napkin, after the German fashion, very\nincommodiously; I foul them more than the Germans or Italians do, and make but little use either of\nspoon or fork. I am sorry they did not keep up the fashion, begun after the example of kings, to change\nour napkins at every service, as they do our plates. We are told of that laborious soldier Marius, that\ngrowing old, he became nice in his drink, and never drank but out of a particular cup of his own: I, in like\nmanner, have suffered myself to fancy a certain form of glasses, and not willingly to drink in common\nglasses, nor more than from a strange common hand: all metal offends me in comparison of a clear and\ntransparent matter: let my eyes taste too, according to their capacity. I owe several other such niceties to\ncustom. Nature has also, on the other side, helped me to some of hers; as not to be able to endure more\nthan two full meals in one day, without overcharging my stomach, nor a total abstinence from one of\nthose meals without filling myself with wind, drying up my mouth, and dulling my appetite; the finding\ngreat inconvenience from overmuch evening air; for of late years in night marches, which often happen to\nbe all night long, after five or six hours my stomach begins to be queasy, with a violent pain in my head,\nso that I always vomit before the day can break. When the others go to breakfast, I go to sleep; and when I\n\nrise, I am as brisk and gay as before. I had always been told that the night dew never rises but in the\nbeginning of the night; but for some years past, long and familiar intercourse with a lord, possessed with\nthe opinion that the night dew is more sharp and dangerous about the declining of the sun, an hour or two\nbefore it sets, which he carefully avoids, and despises that of the night, he almost impressed upon me, not\nso much his reasoning as his experiences. What, shall mere doubt and inquiry strike our imagination, so\nas to change us? Such as absolutely and on a sudden give way to these propensions, draw total destruction\nupon themselves. I am sorry for several gentlemen who, through the folly of their physicians have in their\nyouth and health wholly shut themselves up; it were better to endure a cough, than, by disuse, forever to\nlose the commerce of common life in things of so great utility. Malignant science to interdict us the most\npleasant hours of the day! Let us keep our possession to the last; for the most part, a man hardens himself\nby being obstinate and corrects his constitution, as Caesar did the falling-sickness, by dint of contempt. A\nman should addict himself to the best rules, but not enslave himself to them, except to such, if there be\nany such, where obligation and servitude are of profit.\nBoth kings and philosophers go to stool, and ladies too; public lives are bound to ceremony;\nmine, that is obscure and private, enjoys all natural dispensation; soldier and Gascon are also qualities a\nlittle subject to indiscretion; wherefore I shall say of this act of relieving nature, that it is desirable to refer\nit to certain prescribed and nocturnal hours, and compel one's self to this by custom, as I have done; but\nnot to subject one's self, as I have done in my declining years, to a particular convenience of place and\nseat for that purpose, and make it troublesome by long sitting: and yet, in the fouler offices, is it not in\nsome measure excusable to require more care and cleanliness? ANatura homo mundum et elegans animal\nest.@ Of all the actions of nature, I am the most impatient of being interrupted in that. I have seen many\nsoldiers troubled with the unruliness of their bellies; whereas mine and I never fail of our punctual\nassignation, which is at leaping out of bed, if some indispensable business or sickness does not molest us.\nI think then, as I said before, that sick men cannot better place themselves anywhere in more\nsafety, than in sitting still in that course of life wherein they have been bred and trained up; change, be it\nwhat it will, distempers and puts one out. Do you believe that chestnuts can hurt a Perigourdin or a\nLucchese, or milk and cheese the mountain people? We enjoin them not only a new, but a contrary,\nmethod of life; a change that the healthful cannot endure. Prescribe water to a Breton of three score and\nten; shut a seaman up in a stove; forbid a Basque footman to walk: you will deprive them of motion, and\nin the end of air and light.\nAAn vivere tanti est? Cogimur a suetis animum suspendere rebus, Atque, ut vivamus, vivere\ndesinimus... Hos superesse reor,\nquibus et spirabilis aer Et lux, qua regimur, redditur ipsa gravis.@\nIf they do no other good, they do this at least, that they prepare patients betimes for death, by little\nand little undermining and cutting off the use of life.\nBoth well and sick, I have ever willingly suffered myself to obey the appetites that pressed upon\nme. I give great authority to my propensions and desires; I do not love to cure one disease by another; I\nhate remedies that are more troublesome than the disease itself. To be subject to the stone and subject to\nabstain from eating oysters, are two evils instead of one: the disease torments us on the one side, and the\nremedy on the other. Since we are ever in danger of mistaking, let us rather run the hazard of a mistake,\nafter we have had the pleasure. The world proceeds quite the other way, and thinks nothing profitable that\nis not painful; it has great suspicion of facility. My appetite, in various things, has of its own accord\nhappily enough accommodated itself to the health of my stomach. Relish and pungency in sauces were\npleasant to me when young but my stomach disliking them since, my taste incontinently followed. Wine\nis hurtful to sick people, and it is the first thing that my mouth then finds distasteful, and with an\ninvincible dislike. Whatever I take against my liking, does me harm; and nothing hurts me, that eat with\nappetite and delight. I never received harm by any action that was very pleasant to me; and accordingly\nhave made all medicinal conclusions largely give way to my pleasure; and I have, when I was young,\n\nAQuem circumcursans huc atque huc saepe Cupido Fulgebat crocina splendidus in tunica,@\ngiven myself the rein as licentiously and inconsiderately to the desire that was predominant in me,\nAEt militavi non sine gloria,@ as any other whomsoever; yet more in continuation and holding out, than in\nsally:\nASex me vix memini sustinuisse vices.@\nit is certainly a misfortune and a miracle at once, to confess at what a tender age I first came\nunder the subjection of love: it was indeed, by chance; for it was long before the years of choice or\nknowledge; I do not remember myself so far back; and my fortune may well be coupled with that of\nQuartilla, who could not remember when she was a maid:\nAInde tragus, celeresque pili, mirandaque matri Barba meae.@\nPhysicians modify their rules according to the violent longings that happen to sick persons,\nordinarily with good success; this great desire cannot be imagined so strange and vicious, but that nature\nmust have a hand in it. And then how easy a thing is it to satisfy the fancy? In my opinion, this part\nwholly carries it, at least, above all the rest. The most grievous and ordinary evils are those that fancy\nloads us with; this Spanish saying mightily pleases in several senses; ADefienda me Dios de my.@ I am\nsorry when I am sick, that I have not some longing that might give me the pleasure of satisfying it; all the\nrules of physic would hardly be able to divert me from it. I do the same when I am well; I can see very\nlittle more to be hoped or wished for. 'Twere pity a man should be so weak and languishing, as not to\nhave even wishing left to him.\nThe art of physic is not so fixed, that we need be without authority for whatever we do; it changes\naccording to climates and moons; according to Fernel and to Scaliger. If your physician does not think it\ngood for you to sleep, to drink wine, or to eat such and such meats, never trouble yourself; I will find you\nanother that shall not be of his opinion; the diversity of medical arguments and opinions embraces all\nsorts of forms. I saw a miserable sick person panting and burning for thirst, that he might be cured, who\nwas afterward laughed at for his pains by another physician, who condemned that advice as prejudicial to\nhim: had he not tormented himself to good purpose? There lately died of the stone, a man of that\nprofession, who had made use of extreme abstinence to contend with his disease: his fellow-physicians\nsay that, on the contrary, this abstinence had dried him up, and baked the gravel in his kidneys.\nI have observed, that both in wounds and sicknesses, speaking discomposes and hurts me, as\nmuch as any irregularity I can commit. My voice pains and tires me, for it is loud and forced; so that\nwhen I have gone to whisper some great persons about affairs of consequence, they have often desired me\nto moderate my voice.\nThis story deserves a place here. Someone in a certain Greek school speaking loud as I do, the\nmaster of the ceremonies sent to him to speak softly: ATell him, then, he must send me,@ replied the\nother, Athe tone he would have me speak in.@ To which the other replied, AThat he should take the tone\nfrom the ears of him to whom he spake.@ It was well said, if to be understood: ASpeak according to the\naffair you are speaking about to your auditor,@ for if it mean, Ait is sufficient that he hear you; or, govern\nyourself by him,@ I do not find it to be reason. The tone and motion of my voice carries with it a great\ndeal of the expression and signification of my meaning, and it is I who am to govern it, to make myself\nunderstood: there is a voice to instruct, a voice to flatter, and a voice to reprehend. I will not only that my\nvoice reach him, but, peradventure, that it strike and pierce him. When I rattle my footman with sharp and\nbitter language, it would be very pretty for him to say, APray, master, speak lower, I hear you very well.@\n\nAEst quaedam vox ad auditum accommodata, non magnitudine, sed proprietate.@ Speaking is half his\nwho speaks, and half his who hears; the latter ought to prepare himself to receive it, according to its bias;\nas with tennis players, he who receives the ball, shifts and prepares, according as he sees him move who\nstrikes the stroke, and according to the stroke itself.\nExperience has, moreover, taught me this, that we ruin ourselves by impatience. Evils have their\nlife and limits, their diseases and their recovery.\nThe constitution of maladies is formed by the pattern of the constitution of animals; they have\ntheir fortune and their days limited from their birth; he who attempts imperiously to cut them short by\nforce in the middle of their course, lengthens and multiplies them, and incenses instead of appeasing\nthem. I am of Brantor's opinion, that Awe are neither obstinately and willfully to oppose evils, nor truckle\nunder them for want of courage; but that we are naturally to give way to them, according to their\ncondition and our own.@ We ought to grant free passage to diseases; I find they stay less with me, who let\nthem alone; and I have lost some, reputed the most tenacious and obstinate, by their own decay, without\nhelp and without art, and contrary to its rules. Let us a little permit Nature to take her own way; she better\nunderstands her own affairs than we. ABut such an one died;@ and so shall you: if not of that disease, of\nanother. And how many have not escaped dying, who have had three physicians always at their tails?\nExample is a vague and universal mirror, and of various reflections. If it be a delicious medicine, take it:\nit is always so much present good. I will never stick at the name nor the color, if it be pleasant and\ngrateful to the palate: pleasure is one of the chiefest kinds of profit. I have suffered colds, gouty\ndefluxions, relaxations, palpitations of the heart, meagrims, and other accidents, to grow old and die in\ntime a natural death; I have so lost them when I was half fit to keep them: they are sooner prevailed upon\nby courtesy than huffing. We must patiently suffer the laws of our condition; we are born to grow old, to\ngrow weak, and to be sick, in despite of all medicine. it is the first lesson the Mexicans teach their\nchildren; so soon as ever they are born they thus salute them: AThou art come into the world, child, to\nendure: endure, suffer and say nothing.@ it is injustice to lament that which has befallen any one, which\nmay befall every one: AIndignare, si quid in te inique proprie constitutum est.@\nSee an old man who begs of God that he will maintain his health vigorous and entire; that is to\nsay, that he restore him to youth:\nAStulte, quid haec frustra votis puerilibus optas?@\nis it not folly? his condition is not capable of it. The gout, the stone, and indigestion are\nsymptoms of long years; as heat, rains, and winds are of long journeys. Plato does not believe that\nAesculapius troubled himself to provide, by regimen to prolong life in a weak and wasted body, useless to\nhis country and to his profession, or to beget healthful and robust children; and does not think this care\nsuitable to the divine justice and prudence, which is to direct all things to utility. My good friend, your\nbusiness is done; nobody can restore you; they can, at the most, but patch you up, and prop you a little,\nand by that means prolong your misery an hour or two:\nNon secus instantem cupiens fulcire ruinam, Diversis contra nititur obiicibus; Donec certa\ndies, omni campage soluta, Ipsum\ncum rebus subruat auxilium.@\nWe must learn to suffer what we cannot evade; our life, like the harmony of the world, is\ncomposed of contrary things- of diverse tones, sweet and harsh, sharp and flat, sprightly and solemn: the\nmusician who should only effect some of these, what would he be able to do? he must know how to make\nuse of them all, and to mix them; and so we should mingle the goods and evils which are consubstantial\nwith our life; our being cannot subsist without this mixture, and the one part is no less necessary to it than\nthe other. To attempt to kick against natural necessity, is to represent the folly of Ctesiphon who\n\nundertook to kick with his mule.\nI consult little about the alterations I feel; for these doctors take advantage; when they have you at\ntheir mercy, they cudgel your ears with their prognostics; and having once surprised me, weakened with\nsickness, injuriously handled me with their dogmas and magisterial fopperies- one while menacing me\nwith great pains, and another with approaching death- by which threats I was indeed moved and shaken,\nbut not subdued nor jostled from my place; and though my judgement was neither altered nor distracted,\nyet it was at least disturbed; it is always agitation and combat.\nNow, I use my imagination as gently as I can, and would discharge it, if I could, of all trouble and\ncontest; a man must assist, flatter, and deceive it, if he can; my mind is fit for that office; it needs no\nappearances throughout; could it persuade as it preaches, it would successfully relieve me. Will you have\nan example? It tells me: Athat it is for my good to have the stone; that the structure of my age must\nnaturally suffer some decay, and it is now time it should begin to disjoin and to confess a breach; it is a\ncommon necessity, and there is nothing in it either miraculous or new; I therein pay what is due to old\nage, and I cannot expect a better bargain; that society ought to comfort me, being fallen into the most\ncommon infirmity of my age; I see everywhere men tormented with the same disease, and am honored by\nthe fellowship, forasmuch as men of the best quality are most frequently afflicted with it; it is a noble and\ndignified disease; that of such as are struck with it, few have it to a less degree of pain; that these are put\nto the trouble of a strict diet and the daily taking of nauseous potions, whereas I owe my better state\npurely to my good fortune; for some ordinary broths of Eringo or burst-wort that I have twice or thrice\ntaken to oblige the ladies who, with greater kindness than my pain was sharp, would needs present me\nhalf of theirs, seemed to me equally easy to take and fruitless in operation, the others have to pay a\nthousand vows to Aesculapius, and as many crowns to their physicians, for the voiding a little gravel,\nwhich I often do by the aid of nature; even the decorum of my countenance is not disturbed in company;\nand I can hold my water ten hours, and as long as any man that is in perfect health. The fear of this\ndisease,@ says mind, Aformerly affrighted thee, when it was unknown to thee; the cries and despairing\ngroans of those who make it worse by their impatience, begot a horror in thee. it is an infirmity that\npunishes the members by which thou hast most offended. Thou art a conscientious fellow:@\nQue venit indigne poena, dolenda venit.@\nAconsider this chastisement; it is very easy in comparison of others, and inflicted with a paternal\ntenderness; do but observe how late it comes; it only seizes on and incommodes that part of thy life,\nwhich is, one way and another sterile and lost; having, as it were by composition, given time for the\nlicense and pleasures of thy youth. The fear and the compassion that the people have of this disease serve\nthee for matter of glory; a quality, whereof if thou hast thy judgment purified, and that thy reason has\nsomewhat cured it, thy friends, notwithstanding, discern some tincture in thy complexion. it is a pleasure\nto hear it said of one's self: what strength of mind, what patience! Thou art seen to sweat with pain, to turn\npale and red, to tremble, to vomit blood, to suffer strange contractions and convulsions, at times to let\ngreat tears drop from thine eyes, to urine thick, black, and dreadful water, or to have it suppressed by\nsome sharp and craggy stone, that cruelly pricks and tears the neck of the bladder, while all the while thou\nentertainest the company with an ordinary countenance; drolling by fits with thy people; making one in a\ncontinuous discourse, now and then making excuse for thy pain, and representing thy suffering less than it\nis. Dost thou call to mind the men of past time, who so greedily sought diseases to keep their virtue in\nbreath and exercise? Put the case that nature sets thee on and impels thee to this glorious school, into\nwhich thou wouldst never have entered of thy own free will. If thou tellest me that it is a dangerous and\nmortal disease, what others are not so? for it is a physical cheat to except any that they say do not go\ndirect to death; what matters if they go thither by accident, or if they easily slide and slip into the path that\nleads us to it? But thou dost not die because thou art sick; thou diest because thou art living; death kills\nthee without the help of sickness; and sickness has deferred death in some, who have lived longer by\n\nreason that they thought themselves always dying; to which may be added, that as in wounds, so in\ndiseases, some are medicinal and wholesome. The stone is often no less long-lived than you; we see men\nwith whom it has continued from their infancy even to their extreme old age; and if they had not broken\ncompany, it would have been with them longer still; you more often kill it than it kills you. And though it\nshould present to you the image of approaching death, were it not a good office to a man of such an age,\nto put him in mind of his end? And, which is worse, thou hast no longer anything that should make thee\ndesire to be cured. Whether or no, common necessity will soon call thee away. Do but consider how\nskillfully and gently she puts thee out of concern with life, and weans thee from the world; not forcing\nthee with a tyrannical subjection, like so many other infirmities which thou seest old men afflicted withal,\nthat hold them in continual torment, and keep them in perpetual and unintermitted weakness and pains,\nbut by warnings and instructions at intervals, intermixing long pauses of repose, as it were to give thee\nopportunity to meditate and ruminate upon thy lesson, at thy own ease and leisure. To give thee means to\njudge aright, and to assume the resolution of a man of courage, it presents to thee the state of thy entire\ncondition, both in good and evil; and one while a very cheerful and another an insupportable life, in one\nand the same day. If thou embracest not death, at least thou shakest hands with it once a month; whence\nthou hast more cause to hope that it will one day surprise thee without menace; and that being so often\nconducted to the water side, but still thinking thyself to be upon the accustomed terms, thou and thy\nconfidence will at one time or another be unexpectedly wafted over. A man cannot reasonably complain\nof diseases that fairly divide the time with health.@\nI am obliged to fortune for having so often assaulted me with the same sort of weapons; she forms\nand fashions me by use, hardens and habituates me, so that I can know within a little for how much I shall\nbe quit. For want of natural memory, I make one of paper; and as any new symptom happens in my\ndisease, I set it down, whence it falls out that, having now almost passed through all sorts of examples, if\nanything astounding threatens me, turning over these little loose notes, as the Sybil's leaves, I never fail of\nfinding matter of consolation from some favorable prognostic in my past experience. Custom also makes\nme hope better for the time to come; for, the conduct of this clearing out having so long continued, it is to\nbe believed that nature will not alter her course, and that no other worse accident will happen than what I\nalready feel. And besides, the condition of this disease is not unsuitable to my prompt and sudden\ncomplexion; when it assaults me gently, I am afraid, for it is then for a great while; but it has, naturally,\nbrisk and vigorous excesses; it claws me to purpose for a day or two. My kidneys held out an age without\nalteration; and I have now almost lived another, since they changed their state; evils have their periods, as\nwell as goods; peradventure, the infirmity draws toward an end. Age weakens the heat of my stomach,\nand its digestion being less perfect sends this crude matter to my kidneys; why, at a certain revolution,\nmay not the heat of my kidneys be also abated, so that they can no more petrify my phlegm, and nature\nfind out some other way of purgation. Years have evidently helped me to drain certain rheums; and why\nnot these excrements which furnish matter for gravel? But is there anything delightful in comparison of\nthis sudden change, when from an excessive pain, I come, by the voiding of a stone, to recover, as by a\nflash of lightning, the beautiful light of health, so free and full, as it happens in our sudden and sharpest\ncolics? Is there anything in the pain suffered, that one can counterpoise to the pleasure of so sudden an\namendment? Oh, how much does health seem the more pleasant to me, after a sickness so near and so\ncontiguous, that I can distinguish them in the presence of one another, in their greatest show; when they\nappear in emulation, as if to make head against and dispute it with one another! As the Stoics say that\nvices are profitably introduced to give value to and to set off virtue, we can, with better reason and less\ntemerity of conjecture, say that nature has given us pain for the honor and service of pleasure and\nindolence. When Socrates, after his fetters were knocked off, felt the pleasure of that itching which the\nweight of them had caused in his legs, he rejoiced to consider the strict alliance between pain and\npleasure; how they are linked together by a necessary connection, so that by turns they follow and\nmutually beget one another; and cried out to the good fellow Aesop, that he ought out of this\nconsideration, to have taken matter for a fine fable.\n\nThe worst that I see in other diseases is, that they are not so grievous in their effect, as they are in\ntheir issue: a man is a whole year in recovering, and all the while full of weakness and fear. There is so\nmuch hazard, and so many steps to arrive at safety, that there is no end on't: before they have unmuffled\nyou of a kerchief, and then of a cap, before they allow you to walk abroad and take the air, to drink wine,\nto lie with your wife, or eat melons, it is odds you relapse into some new distemper. The stone has this\nprivilege, that it carries itself clean off: whereas the other maladies always leave behind them some\nimpression and alteration that render the body subject to a new disease, and lend a hand to one another.\nThose are excusable that content themselves with possessing us, without extending farther, and\nintroducing their followers; but courteous and kind are those whose passage brings us any profitable\nissue. Since I have been troubled with the stone, I find myself freed from all other accidents, much more,\nmethinks, than I was before, and have never had any fever since; I argue that the extreme and frequent\nvomitings that I am subject to, purge me: and, on the other hand, my distastes for this and that, and the\nstrange fasts I am forced to keep, digest my peccant humors, and nature, with those stones, voids\nwhatever there is in me superfluous and hurtful. Let them never tell me that it is a medicine too dear\nbought: for what avail so many stinking draughts, so many caustics, incisions, sweats, setons, diets, and\nso many other methods of cure, which often, by reason we are not able to undergo their violence and\nimportunity, bring us to our graves? So that when I have the stone, I look upon it as physic; when free\nfrom it, as an absolute deliverance.\nAnd here is another particular benefit of my disease; which is, that it always plays its game by\nitself, and lets me play mine, if I have only courage to do it; for, in its greatest fury, I have endured it ten\nhours together on horseback. Do but endure only; you need no other regimen: play, run, dine, do this and\nt'other, if you can; your debauch will do you more good than harm; say as much to one that has the pox,\nthe gout, or hernia. The other diseases have more universal obligations; rack our actions after another kind\nof manner, disturb our whole order, and to their consideration engage the whole state of life: this only\npinches the skin; it leaves the understanding and the will wholly at our own disposal, and the tongue, the\nhands, and the feet; it rather awakens than stupefies you. The soul is struck with the ardor of a fever,\noverwhelmed with an epilepsy, and displaced by a sharp megrim, and, in short, astounded by all the\ndiseases that hurt the whole mass, and the most noble parts; this never meddles with the soul; if anything\ngoes amiss with her, it is her own fault, she betrays, dismounts, and abandons herself. There are none but\nfools who suffer themselves to be persuaded, that this hard and massive body which is baked in our\nkidneys is to be dissolved by drinks; wherefore, when it is once stirred, there is nothing to be done but to\ngive it passage; and, for that matter, it will itself make one.\nI moreover observe this particular convenience in it, that it is a disease wherein we have little to\nguess at: we are dispensed from the trouble into which other diseases throw us by the uncertainty of their\ncauses, conditions, and progress; a trouble that is infinitely painful: we have no need of consultations and\ndoctoral interpretations; the senses well enough inform us both what it is and where it is.\nBy such like arguments, weak and strong, as Cicero with the disease of his old age, I try to rock\nasleep and amuse my imagination, and to dress its wounds. If I find them worse to-morrow, I will provide\nnew stratagems. That this is true: I am come to that pass of late, that the least motion forces pure blood\nout of my kidneys: what of that? I move about, nevertheless, as before, and ride after my hounds with a\njuvenile and insolent ardor; and hold that I have very good satisfaction for an accident of that importance,\nwhen it costs me no more but a dull heaviness and uneasiness in that part; it is some great stone that\nwastes and consumes the substance of my kidneys and my life, which I by little and little evacuate, not\nwithout some natural pleasure, as an excrement henceforward superfluous and troublesome. Now if I feel\nanything stirring, do not fancy that I trouble myself to consult my pulse or my urine, thereby to put myself\nupon some annoying prevention; I shall soon enough feel the pain, without making it more and longer, by\nthe disease of fear. He who fears he shall suffer, already suffers what he fears. To which may be added,\nthat the doubts and ignorance of those who take upon them to expound the designs of nature and her\n\ninternal progressions, and the many false prognostics of their art, ought to give us to understand that her\nways are inscrutable and utterly unknown; there is great uncertainty, variety, and obscurity in what she\neither promises or threatens. Old age excepted, which is an indubitable sign of the approach of death, in\nall other accidents I see few signs of the future, whereon we may ground our divination. I only judge of\nmyself by actual sensation, not by reasoning: to what end, since I am resolved to bring nothing to it but\nexpectation and patience? Will you know how much I get by this? observe those who do otherwise, and\nwho rely upon so many diverse persuasions and counsels; how often the imagination presses upon them,\nwithout any bodily pain. I have many times amused myself, being well and in safety, and quite free from\nthese dangerous attacks, in communicating them to the physicians as then beginning to discover\nthemselves in me; I underwent the decree of their dreadful conclusions, being, all the while quite at my\nease, and so much the more obliged to the favor of God, and better satisfied of the vanity of this art.\nThere is nothing that ought so much to be recommended to youth as activity and vigilance: our\nlife is nothing but movement. I bestir myself with great difficulty, and am slow in everything, whether in\nrising, going to bed, or eating: seven of the clock in the morning is early for me; and where I rule, I never\ndine before eleven, nor sup till after six. I formerly attributed the cause of the fevers and other diseases I\nfell into, to the heaviness that long sleeping had brought upon me; and have ever repented going to sleep\nagain in the morning. Plato is more angry at excess of sleeping, than at excess of drinking. I love to lie\nhard and alone, even without my wife, as kings do; and well covered with clothes. They never warm my\nbed, but since I have grown old, they give me at need warm cloths to lay at my feet and stomach. They\nfound fault with the great Scipio, that he was a great sleeper; not, in my opinion, for any other reason,\nthan that men were displeased, that he alone should have nothing in him to be found fault with. If I am\nanything fastidious in my way of living, it is rather in my lying than anything else; but, generally, I give\nway and accommodate myself, as well as any one, to necessity. Sleeping has taken up a great part of my\nlife, and I yet continue, at the age I now am, to sleep eight or nine hours together. I wean myself to my\nadvantage, from this propension to sloth, and am evidently the better for so doing. I find the change a\nlittle hard indeed, but in three days it is over; and I see but few who live with less sleep, when need\nrequires, and who more constantly exercise themselves, or to whom long journeys are less troublesome.\nMy body is capable of a firm, but not of a violent or sudden agitation. I evade of late violent exercises,\nand such as make me sweat, wherein my limbs grow weary before they are hot. I can stand a whole day\ntogether, and am never weary of walking: but from my youth, I have ever preferred to ride upon paved\nroads; on foot, I get up to the breech in dirt; and little fellows as I am are subject in the streets to be\nelbowed and jostled, for want of presence; I have ever loved to repose myself, whether sitting or lying,\nwith my heels as high or higher than my seat.\nThere is no profession more pleasant than the military, a profession both noble in its execution\n(for valor is the stoutest, proudest, and most generous of all virtues), and noble in its cause: there is no\nutility either more universal or more just, than the protection of the peace and grandeur of one's country.\nThe company of so many noble, young, and active men delights you: the ordinary sight of so many tragic\nspectacles; the freedom of the conversation, without art; a masculine and unceremonious way of living,\nplease you; the variety of a thousand several actions; the encouraging harmony of martial music, that\nravishes and inflames both your ears and souls; the honor of this occupation, nay, even its hardships and\ndifficulties, which Plato holds so light that, in his Republic, he makes women and children share in them,\nare delightful to you. You put yourselves voluntarily upon particular exploits and hazards, according as\nyou judge of their luster and importance; and, a volunteer, find even life itself excusably employed,\nAPulchrumque mori succurrit in armis.@\nTo fear common dangers that concern so great a multitude of men; not to dare to do what so\nmany sorts of souls, what a whole people dare, is for a heart that is poor and mean beyond all measure:\ncompany encourages even children. If others excel you in knowledge, in gracefulness, in strength, or\n\nfortune, you have third causes to blame for that; but to give place to them in stability of mind, you can\nblame no one for that but yourself. Death is more abject, more languishing and troublesome in bed than in\nbattle; fevers and catarrhs as painful and mortal as a musket-shot. Whoever has fortified himself valiantly\nto bear the accidents of common life, need not raise his courage to be a soldier. AVivere, mi Lucili,\nmilitare est.@\nI do not remember that I ever had the itch; and yet scratching is one of nature's sweetest\ngratifications, and nearest at hand; but the smart follows too near. I use it most in my ears, which are often\napt to itch.\nI came into the world with all my senses entire, even to perfection. My stomach is commodiously\ngood, as also is my head and my breath; and, for the most part, uphold themselves so in the height of\nfevers. I have passed the age to which some nations, not without reason, have prescribed so just a term of\nlife, that they would not suffer men to exceed it; and yet I have some intermissions, though short and\ninconstant, so clean and sound as to be little inferior to the health and pleasantness of my youth. I do not\nspeak of vigor and sprightliness; it is not reason they should follow me beyond their limits:\nANon hoc amplius est liminis, aut aquae, Coelestis, patiens latus.@\nMy face and eyes presently discover my condition; all my alteration begin there, and appear\nsomewhat worse than they really are; my friends often pity me, before I feel the cause in myself. My\nlooking-glass does not frighten me: for even in my youth it has befallen me more than once to have a\nscurvy complexion and of ill prognostic, without any great consequence, so that the physicians, not\nfinding any cause within answerable to that outward alteration, attributed it to the mind and to some secret\npassion that tormented me within; but they were deceived. If my body would govern itself as well,\naccording to my rule, as my mind does, we should move a little more at our ease. My mind was then not\nonly free from trouble, but, moreover, full of joy and satisfaction, as it commonly is, half by its\ncomplexion, half by its design:\nANec vitiant artus aegrae contagia mentis.@\nI am of the opinion that this temperature of my soul has often raised my body from its lapses; this\nis often depressed; if the other be not brisk and gay, it is at least tranquil and at rest. I had a quartan ague\nfour or five months, that made me look miserably ill; my mind was always, if not calm, yet pleasant. If\nthe pain be without me, the weakness and languor do not much afflict me; I see various corporal faintings,\nthat beget a horror in me but to name, which yet I should less fear than a thousand passions and agitations\nof the mind that I see about me. I make up my mind no more to run; it is enough that I can crawl along;\nnor do I more complain of the natural decadence that I feel in myself:\nAQuis tumidum guttur miratur in Alpibus?@\nthan I regret that my duration shall not be as long and entire as that of an oak.\nI have no reason to complain of my imagination; I have had few thoughts in my life that have so\nmuch as broken my sleep, except those of desire, which have awakened without afflicting me. I dream but\nseldom, and then of chimeras and fantastic things, commonly produced from pleasant thoughts, and rather\nridiculous than sad; and I believe it to be true that dreams are faithful interpreters of our inclinations; but\nthere is art required to sort and understand them:\nARes, quae in vita usurpant homines, cogitant, curant, vident, Quaeque agunt vigilantes,\nagitantque, ea si cui in somno\naccidunt, Minus mirandum est.@\n\nPlato moreover says, that it is the office of prudence to draw instructions of divination of future\nthings from dreams; I don't know about this, but there are wonderful instances of it that Socrates,\nXenophon, and Aristotle, men of irreproachable authority, relate. Historians say that the Atlantes never\ndream; who also never eat any animal food, which I add, forasmuch as it is, peradventure, the reason why\nthey never dream, for Pythagoras ordered a certain preparation of diet to beget appropriate dreams. Mine\nare very gentle, without any agitation of body or expression of voice. I have seen several of my time\nwonderfully disturbed by them. Theon, the philosopher, walked in his sleep, and so did Pericles' servant,\nand that upon the tiles and top of the house.\nI hardly ever choose my dish at table, but take the next at hand, and unwillingly change it for\nanother. A confusion of meats and a clutter of dishes displease me as much as any other confusion; I am\neasily satisfied with few dishes; and am an enemy to the opinion of Favorinus that in a feast they should\nsnatch from you the meat you like, and set a plate of another sort before you; and that it is a pitiful supper,\nif you do not sate your guests with the rumps of various fowls, the beccafico only deserving to be all\neaten. I usually eat salt meats, and yet I love bread that has no salt in it; and my baker never sends up\nother to my table, contrary to the custom of the country. In my infancy, what they had most to correct in\nme was the refusal of things that children commonly best love, as sugar, sweetmeats, and march-panes.\nMy tutor contended with this aversion to delicate things, as a kind of overnicety; and indeed it is nothing\nelse but a difficulty of taste, in anything it applies itself to. Whoever cures a child of an obstinate liking\nfor brown bread, bacon, or garlic, cures him also of pampering his palate. There are some who affect\ntemperance and plainness, by wishing for beef and ham among pheasant and partridge; it is all very fine;\nthis is delicacy upon delicacies; it is the taste of effeminacy that disrelishes ordinary and accustomed\nthings; APer quae luxuria divitiarum taedio ludit.@ Not to make good cheer with what another is enjoying,\nand to be curious in what a man eats, is the essence of this vice:\nASi modica coenare times olus omne patella.@\nThere is, indeed, this difference, that, it is better to oblige one's appetite to things that are most\neasy to be had, but it is always vice to oblige one's self: I formerly said a kinsman of mine was overnice,\nwho, by being in our galleys, had unlearned the use of beds and to undress when he went to sleep.\nIf I had any sons I should willingly wish them my fortune: the good father that God gave me, who\nhas nothing of me but the acknowledgment of his goodness, but truly it is a very hearty one, sent me from\nmy cradle to be brought up in a poor village of his, and there continued me all the while I was at nurse,\nand still longer, bringing me up to the meanest and the most common way of living: AMagna pars\nlibertatis est bene moratus venter.@ Never take upon yourselves, and much less give up to your wives, the\ncare of their nourishment; leave this to fortune, under popular and natural laws; leave it to custom to train\nthem up to frugality and hardship, that they may rather descend from rigors than mount up to them. This\nhumor of his yet aimed at another end to make me familiar with the people and the condition of men who\nmost need our assistance; considering that I should rather regard them who extend their arms to me, than\nthose who turn their backs upon me; and for this reason it was, that he provided me godfathers of the\nmeanest fortune, to oblige and attach me to them.\nNor has his design succeeded altogether ill: for, whether upon the account of the more honor in\nsuch a condescension, or out of a natural compassion that has a very great power over me, I have an\ninclination toward the meaner sort of people. The faction which I should condemn in our civil wars, I\nshould more sharply condemn, flourishing and successful; it would half reconcile me to it, should I see it\nmiserable and overwhelmed. How much do I admire the generous humor of Chelonis, daughter and wife\nto kings of Sparta! while her husband, Cleombrotus, in the commotion of her city, had the advantage over\nLeonidas, her father, she, like a good daughter, stuck close to her father in all his misery and exile, in\nopposition to the conqueror. But so soon as the chance of war turned, she changed her will with the\n\nchange of fortune, and bravely turned to her husband's side, whom she accompanied throughout where his\nruin carried him; admitting, as it appears to me, no other choice than to cleave to the side that stood most\nin need of her, and where she could best manifest her compassion. I am naturally more apt to follow the\nexample of Flaminius, who rather gave his assistance to those who had most need of him than to those\nwho had power to do him good, than I do to that of Pyrrhus, who was of an humor to truckle under the\ngreat, and to domineer over the poor.\nLong sittings at meat both trouble me and do me harm; for, be it for want of moderation, or that I\nwas so accustomed when a child, I eat all the while I sit. Therefore it is that at my own house, though the\nmeals there are of the shortest, I usually sit down a little while after the rest, after the manner of Augustus:\nbut I do not imitate him in rising also before the rest of the company; on the contrary, I love to sit still a\nlong time after, and to hear them talk, provided I am none of the talkers; for I tire and hurt myself with\nspeaking upon a full stomach, as much as I find it pleasant and very wholesome to argue and to strain my\nvoice before dinner.\nThe ancient Greeks and Romans had more reason than we in sitting apart for eating, which is a\nprincipal action of life, if they were not prevented by other extraordinary business, many hours and the\ngreatest part of the night; eating and drinking more deliberately than we do, who perform all our actions\npost-haste; and in extending this natural pleasure to more leisure and better use, intermixing with their\nmeals pleasant and profitable conversation.\nThey whose concern it is to have a care of me, may very easily hinder me from eating anything\nthey think will do me harm; for in such matters I never covet nor miss anything I do not see; but withal, if\nit once comes in my sight, it is in vain to persuade me to forbear; so that when I design to fast, I must be\nkept apart from the supper-table, and must have only so much given me, as is required for a prescribed\ncollation; for if I sit down to table, I forget my resolution. When I order my cook to alter the manner of\ndressing any dish, all my family know what it means, that my stomach is out of order, and that I shall not\ntouch it.\nI love to have all meats, that will endure it, very little boiled or roasted, and prefer them very\nhigh, and even, as to several, quite gone. Nothing but hardness generally offends me (of any other quality\nI am as patient and indifferent as any man I have known); so that, contrary to the common humor, even in\nfish it often happens that I find them both too fresh and too firm: not for want of teeth, which I ever had\ngood, even to excellence, and which age does but now begin to threaten: I have always been used every\nmorning to rub them with a napkin, and before and after dinner. God is favorable to those whom he\nmakes to die by degrees; it is the only benefit of old age; the last death will be so much the less painful; it\nwill kill but a quarter of a man or but half a one at most. I have one tooth lately fallen out without drawing\nand without pain: it was the natural term of its duration; and that part of my being and several others, are\nalready dead, others half dead, of those that were most active, and in highest esteem during my vigorous\nyears; it is so I melt and steal away from myself. What a folly it would be in my understanding, to\napprehend the height of this fall, already so much advanced, as if it were from the very top! I hope I shall\nnot. I, in truth, receive a principal consolation in meditating my death, that it will be just and natural, and\nthat henceforward I cannot herein either require or hope from destiny any other but unlawful favor. Men\nmake themselves believe that we formerly had, as greater stature, so, longer lives, but they deceive\nthemselves; and Solon, who was of those elder times, limits the duration of life to threescore and ten\nyears. I, who have so much and so universally adored that ariston metron of ancient times; and who have\nconcluded the most moderate measures to be the most perfect, shall I pretend to an immeasurable and\nprodigious old age? Whatever happens contrary to the course of nature, may be troublesome; but what\ncomes according to her, should always be pleasant: AOmnia, quae secundum naturam fiunt, sunt habenda\nin bonis.@ And so Plato likewise says, that the death which is occasioned by wounds and diseases is\nviolent; but that which comes upon us, old age conducting us to it, is of all others the most easy, and in\n\nsome sort delicious. AVitam adolescentibus vis aufert, senibus maturitas.@ Death mixes and confounds\nitself throughout with life; decay anticipates its hour, and shoulders itself even into the course of our\nadvance. I have portraits of myself taken at five and twenty, and five and thirty years of age; I compare\nthem with that lately drawn; how variously is it no longer me; how much more is my present image unlike\nthe former, than unlike that I shall go out of the world with? It is too much to abuse nature, to make her\ntrot so far that she must be forced to leave us, and abandon our conduct, our eyes, teeth, legs, and all the\nrest, to the mercy of a foreign and begged assistance, and to resign us into the hands of art, being weary of\nfollowing us herself.\nI am not very fond either of salads or fruits, except melons. My father hated all sorts of sauces; I\nlove them all. Eating too much hurts me; but, as to the quality of what I eat, I do not yet certainly know\nthat any sort of meat disagrees with my stomach; neither have I observed that either full moon or\ndecrease, spring or autumn, have any influence upon me. We have in us notions that are inconstant and\nfor which no reason can be given: for example, I found radishes first grateful to my stomach, since that\nnauseous, and now again grateful. In several other things, I find my stomach and appetite vary after the\nsame manner; I have changed again and again from white wine to claret, from claret to white.\nI am a great lover of fish, and consequently make my fasts feasts, and feasts fasts: and I believe\nwhat some people say, that it is more easy of digestion than flesh. As I make a conscience of eating flesh\nupon the fish-days, so does my taste make a conscience of mixing fish and flesh; the difference between\nthem seems to me too remote.\nFrom my youth, I have sometimes kept out of the way at meals; either to sharpen my appetite\nagainst the next morning (for, as Epicurus fasted and made lean meals to accustom his pleasure to make\nshift without abundance, I, on the contrary, do it to prepare my pleasure to make better and more cheerful\nuse of abundance); or else I fasted to preserve my vigor for the service of some action of body or mind;\nfor both the one and the other of these is cruelly dulled in me by repletion; and, above all things, I hate\nthat foolish coupling of so healthful and sprightly a goddess with that little belching god, bloated with the\nfumes of his liquor;- or to cure my sick stomach, or for want of fit company; for I say, as the same\nEpicurus did, that one is not so much to regard what he eats, as with whom; and I commend Chilo, that he\nwould not engage himself to be at Periander's feast till he first was informed who were to be the other\nguests; no dish is so acceptable to me, nor no sauce so appetizing, as that which is extracted from society.\nI think it more wholesome to eat more leisurely and less, and to eat oftener; but I would have appetite and\nhunger attended to; I should take no pleasure to be fed with three or four pitiful and stinted repasts a day,\nafter a medicinal manner; who will assure me, that, if I have a good appetite in the morning, I shall have\nthe same at supper? But, we old fellows especially, let us take the first opportune time of eating, and leave\nto almanac makers hopes and prognostics. The utmost fruit of my health is pleasure; let us take hold of\nthe present and known. I avoid the invariable in these laws of fasting; he who would have one form serve\nhim, let him avoid the continuing it; we harden ourselves in it, our strength is there stupefied and laid\nasleep; six months after, you shall find your stomach so inured to it, that all you have got is the loss of\nyour liberty of doing otherwise but to your prejudice.\nI never keep my legs and thighs warmer in winter than in summer; one simple pair of silk\nstockings is all. I have suffered myself, for the relief of my colds, to keep my head warmer; and my belly\non the account of my colic; my diseases in a few days habituated themselves thereto, and disdained my\nordinary provisions; we soon get from a coif to a kerchief over it, from a simple cap to a quilted hat; the\ntrimmings of the doublet must not merely serve for ornament; there must be added a hare's skin or a\nvulture's skin, and a cap under the hat; follow this gradation, and you will go a very fine way to work. I\nwill do nothing of the sort, and would willingly leave off what I have begun. If you fall into any new\ninconvenience, all this is labor lost, you are accustomed to it; seek out some other. Thus do they destroy\nthemselves, who submit to be pestered with these enforced and superstitious rules; they must add\n\nsomething more, and something more after that; there is no end on't.\nFor what concerns our affairs and pleasures, it is much more commodious, as the ancients did, to\nlose one's dinner, and defer making good cheer till the hour of retirement and repose, without breaking up\na day; and so was I formerly used to do. As to health, I since by experience find, on the contrary, that it is\nbetter to dine, and that the digestion is better while awake. I am not very used to be thirsty, either well or\nsick; my mouth is, indeed, apt to be dry, but without thirst; and commonly I never drink but with thirst\nthat is created by eating, and far on in the meal; I drink pretty well for a man of my pitch; in summer, and\nat a relishing meal, I do not only exceed the limits of Augustus, who drank but thrice, precisely; but not to\noffend Democritus' rule who forbade that men should stop at four times as an unlucky number, I proceed\nat need to the fifth glass, about three half-pints; for the little glasses are my favorites, and I like to drink\nthem off, which other people avoid as an unbecoming thing. I mix my wine sometimes with half,\nsometimes with the third part water; and when I am at home, by an ancient custom that my father's\nphysician prescribed both to him and himself, they mix that which is designed for me in the buttery, two\nor three hours before it is brought in. it is said, that Cranaus, king of Athens, was the inventor of this\ncustom of dashing wine with water; whether useful or no, I have heard disputed. I think it more decent\nand wholesome for children to drink no wine till after sixteen or eighteen years of age. The most usual\nand common method of living is the most becoming; all particularity, in my opinion, is to be avoided; and\nI should as much hate a German who mixed water with his wine, as I should a Frenchman who drank it\npure. Public usage gives the law in these things.\nI fear a fog, and fly from smoke as from the plague; the first repairs I fell upon in my own house,\nwere the chimneys and houses of office, the common and insupportable defects of all old buildings; and\namong the difficulties of war, I reckon the choking dust they make us ride in a whole day together. I have\na free and easy respiration; and my colds for the most part go off without offense to the lungs, and\nwithout a cough.\nThe heat of summer is more an enemy to me than the cold of winter; for, besides the\nincommodity of heat, less remediable than cold, and besides the force of the sunbeams that strike upon\nthe head, all glittering light offends my eyes, so that I could not now sit at dinner over against a flaming\nfire.\nTo dull the whiteness of paper, in those times when I was more wont to read, I laid a piece of\nglass upon my book, and found my eyes much relieved by it. I am to this hour ignorant of the use of\nspectacles; and I can see as far as ever I did, or any other. it is true, that in the evening I begin to find a\nlittle disturbance and weakness in my sight if I read; an exercise I have always found troublesome,\nespecially by night. Here is one step back and a very manifest one; I shall retire another; from the second\nto the third, and so to the fourth, so gently, that I shall be stark blind before I shall be sensible of the age\nand decay of my sight; so artificially do the Fatal sisters untwist our lives. And so I doubt whether my\nhearing begins to grow thick; and you will see I shall have half lost it, when I shall still lay the fault on\nthe voices of those who speak to me. A man must screw up his soul to a high pitch, to make it sensible\nhow it ebbs away.\nMy walking is quick and firm; and I know not which of the two, my mind or my body, I have\nmost to do to keep in the same state. That preacher is very much my friend who can oblige my attention a\nwhole sermon through; in places of ceremony, where every one's countenance is so starched, where I\nhave seen the ladies keep even their eyes so fixed, I could never order it so, that some part or other of me\ndid not lash out; so that though I was seated, I was never settled. As the philosopher Chrysippus' maid\nsaid of her master, that he was only drunk in his legs, for it was his custom to be always kicking them\nabout in what place soever he sat; and she said it, when the wine having made all his companions drunk,\nhe found no alteration in himself at all; it may have been said of me from my infancy that I had either\n\nfolly or quicksilver in my feet, so much stirring and unsettledness there is in them, wherever they are\nplaced.\nit is indecent, besides the hurt it does to one's health, and even to the pleasure of eating, to eat so\ngreedily as I do; I often bite my tongue, and sometimes my fingers, in my haste. Diogenes meeting a boy\neating after that manner, gave his tutor a box on the ear. There were men at Rome that taught people to\nchew, as well as to walk, with a good grace. I lose thereby the leisure of speaking, which gives great\nrelish to the dinner-table, provided the discourse be suitable, that is, pleasant and short.\nThere is jealousy and envy among our pleasures; they cross and hinder one another; Alcibiades, a\nman who well understood how to make good cheer, banished even music from the table, that it might not\ndisturb the entertainment of discourse, for the reason, as Plato tells us, Athat it is the custom of ordinary\npeople to call fiddlers and singing men to feasts, for want of good discourse and pleasant talk, with which\nmen of understanding know how to entertain one another.@ Varro requires all this in entertainments:\nAPersons of graceful presence and agreeable conversation, who are neither silent nor babblers; neatness\nand delicacy, both of meat and place; and fair weather.@ The art of dining well is no slight art, the\npleasure not a slight pleasure; neither the greatest captains nor the greatest philosophers have disdained\nthe use or science of eating well. My imagination has delivered three repasts to the custody of my\nmemory, which fortune rendered sovereignly sweet to me, upon several occasions in my more flourishing\nage; my present state excludes me; for every one, according to the good temper of body and mind wherein\nhe then finds himself, furnishes for his own share a particular grace and savor. I, who but crawl upon the\nearth, hate this inhuman wisdom, that will have us despise and hate all culture of the body; I look upon it\nas an equal injustice to loathe natural pleasures as to be too much in love with them. Xerxes was a\ncoxcombical blockhead who, environed with all human delights, proposed a reward to him who could\nfind out others; but he is not much less so who cuts off any of those pleasures that nature has provided for\nhim. A man should neither pursue nor avoid them, but receive them. I receive them, I confess, a little too\nwarmly and kindly, and easily suffer myself to follow my natural propensions. We have no need to\nexaggerate their inanity; they themselves will make us sufficiently sensible of it, thanks to our sick\nwet-blanket mind, that puts us out of taste with them as with itself; it treats both itself and all it receives,\none while better, and another worse, according to its insatiable, vagabond, and versatile essence:\nASincerum est nisi vas, quodcunque infundis, acescit.@\nI, who boast that I so curiously and particularly embrace the conveniences of life, find them,\nwhen I most nearly consider them, very little more than wind. But what? We are all wind throughout; and,\nmoreover, the wind itself, more discreet than we, loves to bluster and shift from corner to corner; and\ncontents itself with its proper offices, without desiring stability and solidity- qualities that nothing belong\nto it.\nThe pure pleasures, as well as the pure displeasures, of the imagination, say some, are the\ngreatest, as was expressed by the balance of Critolaus. it is no wonder; it makes them to its own liking,\nand cuts them out of the whole cloth; of this I every day see notable examples, and, peradventure, to be\ndesired. But I, who am of a mixed and heavy condition, cannot snap so soon at this one simple object, but\nthat I negligently suffer myself to be carried away with the present pleasures of the general human law,\nintellectually sensible, and sensibly intellectual. The Cyrenaic philosophers will have it that as corporal\npains, so corporal pleasures are more powerful, both as double and as more just. There are some, as\nAristotle says, who out of a savage kind of stupidity dislike them; and I know others who out of ambition\ndo the same. Why do they not, moreover, forswear breathing? why do they not live of their own? why not\nrefuse light, because it shines gratis, and costs them neither pains nor invention? Let Mars, Pallas, or\nMercury afford them their light by which to see, instead of Venus, Ceres, and Bacchus. Will they not seek\nthe quadrature of the circle, even when on their wives? I hate that we should be enjoined to have our\nminds in the clouds, when our bodies are at table; I would not have the mind nailed there, nor wallow\n\nthere; I would have it take place there and sit, but not lie down. Aristippus maintained nothing but the\nbody, as if he had no soul; Zeno stickled only for the soul, as if he had no body; both of them faultily.\nPythagoras, they say, followed a philosophy that was all contemplation; Socrates one that was all conduct\nand action; Plato found a mean between the two; but they only say this for the sake of talking. The true\npoint is found in Socrates; and Plato is much more Socratic than Pythagoric, and it becomes him better.\nWhen I dance, I dance; when I sleep, I sleep. Nay, when I walk alone in a beautiful orchard, if my\nthoughts are some part of the time taken up with foreign occurrences, I some part of the time call them\nback again to my walk, to the orchard, to the sweetness of the solitude, and to myself.\nNature has with a motherly tenderness observed this, that the actions she has enjoined us for our\nnecessity should be also pleasant to us; and she invites us to them, not only by reason, but also by\nappetite, and it is injustice to infringe her laws. When I see both Caesar and Alexander in the thickest of\ntheir greatest business, so fully enjoy human and corporal pleasures, I do not hold that they slackened\ntheir souls, but wound them up higher, by vigor of courage, subjecting these violent employments and\nlaborious thoughts to the ordinary usage of life; wise, had they believed the last was their ordinary, the\nfirst their extroardinary vocation. We are great fools. AHe has passed over his life in idleness,@ say we: AI\nhave done nothing to-day.@ What? have you not lived? that is not only the fundamental, but the most\nillustrious of all your occupations. AHad I been put to the management of great affairs, I should have\nmade it seen what I could do.@ Have you known how to meditate and manage your life, you have\nperformed the greatest work of all. For a man to show and set out himself, nature has no need of fortune;\nshe equally manifests herself in all stages, and behind a curtain as well as without one. Have you known\nhow to regulate your conduct, you have done a great deal more than he who has composed books. Have\nyou known how to take repose, you have done more than he who has taken cities and empires.\nThe great and glorious masterpiece of man is to know how to live to purpose; all other things, to\nreign, to lay up treasure, to build, are, at most, but little appendices and props. I delight to see a general of\nan army, at the foot of a breach he is presently to assault, give himself up entire and free at dinner, to talk\nand be merry with his friends; to see Brutus, when heaven and earth were conspired against him and the\nRoman liberty, stealing some hours of the night from his rounds to read and abridge Polybius, in all\nsecurity. it is for little souls, that truckle under the weight of affairs, not from them to know how clearly to\ndisengage themselves, not to know how to lay them aside and take them up again:\nAO fortes, pejoraque passi Mecum saepe viri! nunc vino pellite curas: Cras ingens iterabimus\naequor.@\nWhether it be in jest or earnest, that the theological and Sorbonical wine, and their feasts, are\nturned into a proverb, I find it reasonable they should dine so much more commodiously and pleasantly,\nas they have profitably and seriously employed the morning in the exercise of their schools. The\nconscience of having well spent the other hours, is the just and savory sauce of the dinner-table. The sages\nlived after that manner; and that inimitable emulation to virtue, which astonishes us both in the one and\nthe other Cato, that humor of theirs, so severe as even to be importunate, gently submits itself and yields\nto the laws of the human condition, of Venus and Bacchus; according to the precepts of their sect, that\nrequire the perfect sage to be as expert and intelligent in the use of natural pleasures as in all other duties\nof life: ACui cor sapiat, ei et sapiat palatus.@\nRelaxation and facility, methinks, wonderfully honor and best become a strong and generous\nsoul. Epaminondas did not think that to take part, and that heartily, in songs and sports and dances with\nthe young men of his city, were things that in any way derogated from the honor of his glorious victories\nand the perfect purity of manners that was in him. And among so many admirable actions of Scipio, the\ngrandfather, a person worthy to be reputed of a heavenly extraction, there is nothing that gives him a\ngreater grace than to see him carelessly and childishly trifling at gathering and selecting shells, and\n\nplaying at quoits upon the seashore with Laelius; and, if it was foul weather, amusing and pleasing\nhimself in representing by writing in comedies the meanest and most popular actions of men; or having\nhis head full of that wonderful enterprise of Hannibal and Africa, visiting the schools in Sicily, and\nattending philosophical lectures, improving himself, to the blind envy of his enemies at Rome. Nor is\nthere anything more remarkable in Socrates than that, old as he was, he found time to make himself taught\ndancing and playing upon instruments, and thought it time well spent; but this same man was seen in an\necstasy, standing upon his feet a whole day and a night together, in the presence of all the Grecian army,\nsurprised and ravished with some profound thought. He was the first who, among so many valiant men of\nthe army, ran to the relief of Alcibiades, oppressed with the enemy; shielded him with his own body, and\ndisengaged him from the crowd, by absolute force of arms. It was he who, in the Delian battle, raised and\nsaved Xenophon when fallen from his horse; and who, among all the people of Athens, enraged as he was\nat so unworthy a spectacle, first presented himself to rescue Theramenes, whom the thirty tyrants were\nhauling to execution by their satellites, and desisted not from his bold enterprise but at the remonstrance\nof Theramenes himself, though he was only followed by two more in all. He was seen, when courted by a\nbeauty with whom he was in love, to maintain at need a severe abstinence. He was seen ever to go to the\nwars, and walk upon ice, with bare feet; to wear the same robe winter and summer; to surpass all his\ncompanions in patience of bearing hardships, and to eat no more at a feast than at his own private dinner.\nHe was seen, for seven and twenty years together, to endure hunger, poverty, the indocility of his\nchildren, and the claws of his wife, with the same countenance; and, in the end, calumny, tyranny,\nimprisonment, fetters, and poison. But was this man obliged to drink full bumpers by any rule of civility?\nhe was also the man of the whole army, with whom the advantage in drinking remained. And he never\nrefused to play at cob-nut, nor to ride the hobby-horse with children, and it became him well; for all\nactions, says philosophy, equally become and equally honor a wise man. We have enough wherewithal to\ndo it, and we ought never to be weary of presenting the image of this great man in all the patterns and\nforms of perfections. There are very few examples of life, full and pure; and we wrong our teaching every\nday, to propose to ourselves those that are weak and imperfect, scarce good for any one service, and\nrather pull us back; corrupters rather than correctors of manners. The people deceive themselves; a man\ngoes much more easily indeed by the ends, where the extremity serves for a bound, a stop, and guide, than\nby the middle way, large and open; and according to art, more than according to nature: but withal much\nless nobly and commendably.\nGrandeur of soul consists not so much in mounting and in pressing forward, as in knowing how\nto govern and circumscribe itself; it takes everything for great, that is enough, and demonstrates itself\nbetter in moderate than in eminent things. There is nothing so fine and legitimate as well and duly to play\nthe man; nor science so arduous as well and naturally to know how to live this life; and of all the\ninfirmities we have, it is the most savage to despise our being.\nWhoever has a mind to send his soul abroad, when the body is ill at ease, to preserve it from the\ncontagion, let him, by all means, do it if he can: but, otherwise, let him on the contrary favor and assist it,\nand not refuse to participate of its natural pleasures with a conjugal complacency, bringing to it, if it be\nthe wiser, moderation, lest by indiscretion they should get confounded with pleasure. Intemperance is the\npest of pleasure; and temperance is not its scourge, but rather its seasoning. Eudoxus, who therein\nestablished the sovereign good, and his companions, who set so high a value upon it, tasted it in its most\ncharming sweetness, by the means of temperance, which in them was singular and exemplary.\nI enjoin my soul to look upon pain and pleasure with an eye equally regular, AEodem enim vitio\nest effusio animi in laetitia, quo in dolore contractio,@ and equally firm; but the one gayly and the other\nseverely, and, so far as it is able, to be as careful to extinguish the one, as to extend the other. The judging\nrightly of good brings along with it the judging soundly of evil; pain has something of the inevitable in its\ntender beginnings, and pleasure something of the evitable in its excessive end. Plato couples them\ntogether, and wills that it should be equally the office of fortitude to fight against pain, and against the\n\nimmoderate and charming blandishments of pleasure; they are two fountains, from which whoever draws,\nwhen and as much as he needs, whether city, man, or beast, is very fortunate. The first is to be taken\nmedicinally and upon necessity, and more scantily; the other for thirst, but not to drunkenness. Pain,\npleasure, love, and hatred are the first things that a child is sensible of; if, when reason comes, they apply\nit to themselves, that is virtue.\nI have a special nomenclature of my own; I Apass away time,@ when it is ill and uneasy, but\nwhen it is good I do not pass it away; AI taste it over again and stick to it;@ one must run over the ill, and\nsettle upon the good. This ordinary phrase of pastime, and passing away the time, represents the usage of\nthose wise sort of people who think they cannot do better with their lives than to let them run out and\nslide away, pass them over, and balk them, and, as much as they can, ignore them, and shun them as a\nthing of troublesome and contemptible quality; but I know it to be another kind of thing, and find it both\nvaluable and commodious, even in its latest decay, wherein I now enjoy it; and nature has delivered it into\nour hands in such and so favorable circumstances, that we have only ourselves to blame if it be\ntroublesome to us, or slide unprofitably away: AStulti vita ingrata est, trepida est, tota in futurum fertur.@\nNevertheless, I compose myself to lose mine without regret; but withal as a thing that is perishable by its\ncondition, not that it troubles or annoys me. Nor does it properly well become any not to be displeased\nwhen they die, excepting such as are pleased to live. There is good husbandry in enjoying it; I enjoy it\ndouble to what others do; for the measure of its fruition depends upon the more or less of our application\nto it. Now especially that I perceive mine to be so short in time, I will extend it in weight; I will stop the\npromptitude of its flight by the promptitude of my grasp; and by the vigor of using it compensate the\nspeed of its running away; by how much the possession of living is more short, I must make it so much\ndeeper and more full.\nOthers feel the pleasure of content and prosperity; I feel it too, as well as they, but not as it slides\nand passes by; one should study, taste, and ruminate upon it, to render condign thanks to Him who grants\nit to us. They enjoy the other pleasures as they do that of sleep, without knowing it. To the end that even\nsleep itself should not so stupidly escape from me, I have formerly caused myself to be disturbed in my\nsleep, so that I might the better and more sensibly relish and taste it. I ponder with myself of content; I do\nnot skim over, but sound it; and I bend my reason, now grown perverse and peevish, to entertain it. Do I\nfind myself in any calm composedness? is there any pleasure that tickles me? I do not suffer it to dally\nwith my senses only, I associate my soul to it too; not there to engage itself, but therein to take delight;\nnot there to lose itself, but to be present there; and I employ it, on its part, to view itself in this prosperous\nstate, to weigh and appreciate its happiness, and to amplify it. It reckons how much it stands indebted to\nAlmighty God that its conscience and the intestine passions are in repose; that it has the body in its\nnatural disposition, orderly and competently enjoying the soft and soothing functions, by which He of His\ngrace is pleased to compensate the sufferings wherewith His justice at His good pleasure chastises us. It\nreflects how great a benefit it is to be so protected, that, which way soever it turns its eye, the heavens are\ncalm around it. No desire, no fear or doubt, troubles the air; no difficulty, past, present, or to come, that its\nimagination may not pass over without offense. This consideration takes great luster from the comparison\nof different conditions; and therefore it is that I present to my thought, in a thousand aspects, those whom\nfortune or their own error torments and carries away; and those, who more like to me, so negligently and\nincuriously receive their good fortune. Those are men who pass away their time, indeed; they pass over\nthe present, and that which they possess, to give themselves up to hope, and for vain shadows and images\nwhich fancy puts into their heads:\nAMorte obita quales fama est volitare figuras, Aut quae sopitos deludunt somnia sensus:@\nwhich hasten and prolong their flight, according as they are pursued. The fruit and end of their\npursuit is to pursue; as Alexander said, that the end of his labor was to labor:\n\nANil actum credens, cum quid superesset agendum;@\nFor my part then, I love life, and cultivate it, such as it has pleased God to bestow it upon us. I do\nnot desire it should be without the necessity of eating and drinking; and I should think myself inexcusable\nto wish it had been twice as long: ASapiens divitiarum naturalium quaesitor accerimus:@ nor that we\nshould support ourselves by putting only a little of that drug into our mouths, by which Epimenides took\naway his appetite, and kept himself alive; nor that we should stupidly beget children with our fingers or\nheels, but, rather, with reverence be it spoken, that we might voluptuously beget them with our fingers\nand heels; nor that the body should be without desire, and without titillation. These are ungrateful and\nwicked complaints. I accept kindly, and with gratitude, what nature has done for me; am well pleased\nwith it, and proud of it. A man does wrong to the great omnipotent Giver of all things, to refuse, annul, or\ndisfigure his gift; all goodness Himself, He has made everything good: AOmnia quoe secundum naturam\nsunt, oestimatione digna sunt.@\nOf philosophical opinions, I preferably embrace those that are most solid, that is to say the most\nhuman, and most our own: my discourse is, suitable to my manners, low and humble; philosophy plays\nthe child, to my thinking, when it puts itself upon its Ergos, to preach to us that it is a barbarous alliance\nto marry the divine with the earthly, the reasonable with the unreasonable, the severe with the indulgent,\nthe honest with the dishonest; that pleasure is a brutish quality, unworthy to be tasted by a wise man; that\nthe sole pleasure he extracts from the enjoyment of a fair young wife, is a pleasure of his conscience to\nperform an action according to order, as to put on his boots for a profitable journey. Oh, that its followers\nhad no more right, nor nerves, nor juice, in getting their wives' maidenhoods, than in its lessons.\nThat is not what Socrates says, who is its master and ours: he values, as he ought, bodily pleasure;\nbut he prefers that of the mind, as having more force, constancy, facility, variety, and dignity. This,\naccording to him, goes by no means alone- he is not so fantastic- but only it goes first; temperance, with\nhim, is the moderatrix, not the adversary of pleasure. Nature is a gentle guide, but not more sweet and\ngentle, than prudent and just: AIntrandum est in rerum naturam, et penitus, quid ea postulet,\npervidendum.@ I hunt after her foot throughout; we have confounded it with artificial traces; and that\nacademic and peripatetic good, which is, Ato live according to it,@ becomes, by this means, hard to limit\nand explain; and that of the Stoics, cousin-german to it, which is Ato consent to nature.@ Is it not an error\nto esteem any actions less worthy, because they are necessary? And yet they will not beat it out of my\nhead, that it is not a very convenient marriage of pleasure with necessity, with which, says an ancient, the\ngods always conspire. To what end do we dismember by divorce a building united by so close and\nbrotherly a correspondence? Let us, on the contrary, confirm it by mutual offices; let the mind rouse and\nquicken the heaviness of the body, and the body stay and fix the levity of the soul. AQui, velut summum\nbonum, laudat animoe naturam, et, tanquam malum, naturam carnis accusat, profecto et animam carnaliter\nappetit, et carnem carnaliter fugit; quoniam id vanitate sentit humana, non veritate divina.@ In this present\nthat God has made us, there is nothing unworthy our care; we stand accountable, even to a hair and it is\nno slight commission to man, to conduct man according to his condition; it is express, plain, and the\nprincipal injunction of all, and the Creator has seriously and strictly enjoined it. Authority has alone\npower to work upon common understandings, and is of more weight in a foreign language; therefore let\nus again charge with it in this place: AStultitiae proprium quis non dixerit, ignave et contumaciter facere,\nquae facienda sunt; et alio corpus impellere, alio animum; distrahique inter diversissimos motus?@ To\nmake this apparent, ask any one, some day, to tell you what whimsies and imaginations he put into his\npate, upon the account of which he diverted his thoughts from a good meal, and regrets the time he spends\nin eating: you will find there is nothing so insipid in all the dishes at your table, as this wise meditation of\nhis (for the most part we had better sleep than wake to the purpose we wake); and that his discourses and\nnotions are not worth the worst mess there. Though they were the ecstasies of Archimedes himself, what\nthen? I do not here speak of, nor mix with the rabble of us ordinary men, and the vanity of the thoughts\nand desires that divert us, those venerable souls, elevated by the ardor of devotion and religion, to a\n\nconstant and conscientious meditation of divine things, who, by the energy of vivid and vehement hope,\nprepossessing the use of the eternal nourishment, the final aim and last step of Christian desires, the sole,\nconstant, and incorruptible pleasure, disdain to apply themselves to our necessitous, fluid and ambiguous\nconveniences, and easily resign to the body the care and use of sensual and temporal pasture: it is a\nprivileged study. Between ourselves, I have ever observed supercelestial opinions and subterranean\nmanners to be of singular accord.\n\nAesop, that great man, saw his master make water as he walked: AWhat, then,@ said he,\nAmust we dung as we run?@ Let us manage our time as well as we can, there will yet remain a\ngreat deal that will be idle and ill employed. The mind has not other hours enough wherein to do\nits business, without disassociating itself from the body, in that little space it must have for its\nnecessity. They would put themselves out of themselves, and escape from being men; it is folly;\ninstead of transforming themselves into angels, they transform themselves into beasts; instead of\nelevating, they lay themselves lower. These transcendental humors affright me, like high and\ninaccessible cliffs and precipices; and nothing is hard for me to digest in the life of Socrates but\nhis ecstacies and communication with demons; nothing so human in Plato as that for which they\nsay he was called divine; and of our sciences, those seem to be the most terrestrial and low that\nare highest mounted; and I find nothing so humble and mortal in the life of Alexander, as his\nfancies about his immortalization. Philotas pleasantly quipped him in his answer: he\ncongratulated him by letter concerning the oracle of Jupiter Hammon, which had placed him\namong the gods: AUpon thy account, I am glad of it, but the men are to be pitied who are to live\nwith a man, and to obey him, who exceeds and is not contented with the measure of a man.@\nADiis te minorem quod geris, imperas.@ The pretty inscription wherewith the Athenians honored\nthe entry of Pompey into their city, is conformable to my sense: ABy so much thou art a god, as\nthou confessest thee a man.@ it is an absolute and, as it were, a divine perfection, for a man to\nknow how loyally to enjoy his being. We seek other conditions, by reason we do not understand\nthe use of our own; and go out of ourselves, because we know not how there to reside. it is to\nmuch purpose to go upon stilts, for, when upon stilts, we must yet walk with our legs; and when\nseated upon the most elevated throne in the world, we are but seated upon our buttocks. The\nfairest lives, in my opinion, are those which regularly accommodate themselves to the common\nand human model; without miracle, without extravagance. Old age stands a little in need of a\nmore gentle treatment. Let us recommend it to God, the protector of health and wisdom, but\nwithal, let it be gay and sociable.\nAFrui paratis et valido mihi Latoe, dones, et, precor, integra Cum mente; nec turpem\nsenectam Degere, nec Cithara carentem.@"

Excerpted and adapted into modern English by A.C. Kibel\nLEVIATHAN by Thomas Hobbes (1651)\nINTRODUCTION\nNATURE (the art whereby God hath made and governs the world) is by the art of man, as in many other things, so\nin this also imitated, that it can make an artificial animal. For seeing life is but a motion of limbs, the beginning\nwhereof is in some principal part within, why may we not say that all automata (engines that move themselves by\nsprings and wheels as doth a watch) have an artificial life? For what is the heart, but a spring; and the nerves, but so\nmany strings; and the joints, but so many wheels, giving motion to the whole body, such as was intended by the\nArtificer? Art goes yet further, imitating that rational and most excellent work of Nature, man. For by art is created\nthat great LEVIATHAN called a COMMONWEALTH, or STATE (in Latin, CIVITAS), which is but an artificial\nman, though of greater stature and strength than the natural, for whose protection and defense it was intended; and in\nwhich the sovereignty is an artificial soul, as giving life and motion to the whole body; the magistrates and other\nofficers of judicature and execution, artificial joints; reward and punishment (by which fastened to the seat of the\nsovereignty, every joint and member is moved to perform his duty) are the nerves, that do the same in the body\nnatural; the wealth and riches of all the particular members are the strength; salus populi (the people's safety) its\nbusiness; counselors, by whom all things needful for it to know are suggested unto it, are the memory; equity and\nlaws, an artificial reason and will; concord, health; sedition, sickness; and civil war, death. Lastly, the pacts and\ncovenants, by which the parts of this body politic were at first made, set together, and united, resemble that fiat, or\nthe Let us make man, pronounced by God in the Creation.\nTo describe the nature of this artificial man, I will consider: First, the matter thereof, and the artificer; both which is\nman. Secondly, how, and by what covenants it is made; what are the rights and just power or authority of a\nsovereign; and what it is that preserves and dissolves it. Thirdly, what is a Christian Commonwealth. Lastly, what\nis the Kingdom of Darkness.\nConcerning the first, there is a saying much usurped of late, that wisdom is acquired, not by reading of books, but of\nmen. Consequently whereunto, those persons, that for the most part can give no other proof of being wise, take great\ndelight to show what they think they have read in men, by uncharitable censures of one another behind their backs.\nBut there is another saying not of late understood, by which they might learn truly to read one another, if they would\ntake the pains; and that is, Nosce teipsum, Read thyself: which was not meant, as it is now used, to countenance\neither the barbarous state of men in power towards their inferiors, or to encourage men of low degree to a saucy\nbehavior towards their betters; but to teach us that for the similitude of the thoughts and passions of one man, to the\nthoughts and passions of another, whosoever looks into himself and considers what he doth when he does think,\nopine, reason, hope, fear, etc., and upon what grounds; he shall thereby read and know what are the thoughts and\npassions of all other men upon the like occasions. I say the similitude of passions, which are the same in all men, --\ndesire, fear, hope, etc.; not the similitude of the objects of the passions, which are the things desired, feared, hoped,\netc.: for these the constitution individual, and particular education, do so vary, and they are so easy to be kept from\nour knowledge, that the characters of man's heart, blotted and confounded as they are with dissembling, lying,\ncounterfeiting, and erroneous doctrines, are legible only to him that searches hearts. And though by men's actions we\ndo discover their design sometimes; yet to do it without comparing them with our own, and distinguishing all\ncircumstances by which the case may come to be altered, is to decipher without a key, and be for the most part\ndeceived, by too much trust or by too much diffidence, as he that reads is himself a good or evil man.\n\nBut let one man read another by his actions never so perfectly, it serves him only with his acquaintance, which are\nbut few. He that is to govern a whole nation must read in himself, not this, or that particular man; but mankind:\nwhich though it be hard to do, harder than to learn any language or science; yet, when I shall have set down my own\nreading orderly and perspicuously, the pains left another will be only to consider if he also find not the same in\nhimself. For this kind of doctrine admits no other demonstration.\nCHAPTER I\nOF SENSE\nCONCERNING the thoughts of man, I will consider them first singly, and afterwards in train or dependence upon\none another. Singly, they are every one a representation or appearance of some quality, or other accident of a body\nwithout us, which is commonly called an object. Which object works on the eyes, ears, and other parts of man's\nbody, and by diversity of working produces diversity of appearances.\nThe original of them all is that which we call sense, (for there is no conception in a man's mind which hath not at\nfirst, totally or by parts, been begotten upon the organs of sense). The rest are derived from that original.\nTo know the natural cause of sense is not very necessary to the business now in hand; and I have elsewhere written\nof the same at large. Nevertheless, to fill each part of my present method, I will briefly deliver the same in this place.\nThe cause of sense is the external body, or object, which presses the organ proper to each sense, either immediately,\nas in the taste and touch; or mediately, as in seeing, hearing, and smelling: which pressure, by the mediation of\nnerves and other strings and membranes of the body, continued inwards to the brain and heart, causes there a\nresistance, or counter-pressure, or endeavor of the heart to deliver itself: which endeavor, because outward, seems to\nbe some matter without. And this seeming, or fancy, is that which men call sense; and consists, as to the eye, in a\nlight, or color figured; to the ear, in a sound; to the nostril, in an odor; to the tongue and palate, in a savor; and to the\nrest of the body, in heat, cold, hardness, softness, and such other qualities as we discern by feeling. All which\nqualities called sensible are in the object that causes them but so many several motions of the matter, by which it\npresses our organs diversely. Neither in us that are pressed are they anything else but diverse motions (for motion\nproduces nothing but motion). But their appearance to us is fancy, the same waking that dreaming. And as pressing,\nrubbing, or striking the eye makes us fancy a light, and pressing the ear produces a din; so do the bodies also we see,\nor hear, produce the same by their strong, though unobserved action. For if those colors and sounds were in the\nbodies or objects that cause them, they could not be severed from them, as by glasses and in echoes by reflection we\nsee they are: where we know the thing we see is in one place; the appearance, in another. And though at some\ncertain distance the real and very object seem invested with the fancy it begets in us; yet still the object is one thing,\nthe image or fancy is another. So that sense in all cases is nothing else but original fancy caused (as I have said) by\nthe pressure that is, by the motion of external things upon our eyes, ears, and other organs, thereunto ordained.\nBut the philosophy schools, through all the universities of Christendom, grounded upon certain texts of Aristotle,\nteach another doctrine; and say, for the cause of vision, that the thing seen sends forth on every side a visible\nspecies, (in English) a visible show, apparition, or aspect, or a being seen; the receiving whereof into the eye is\nseeing. And for the cause of hearing, that the thing heard sends forth an audible species, that is, an audible aspect, or\naudible being seen; which, entering at the ear, makes hearing. Nay, for the cause of understanding also, they say the\nthing understood sends forth an intelligible species, that is, an intelligible being seen; which, coming into the\nunderstanding, makes us understand. I say not this, as disapproving the use of universities: but because I am to speak\nhereafter of their office in a Commonwealth, I must let you see on all occasions by the way what things would be\namended in them; amongst which the frequency of insignificant speech is one.\nCHAPTER II\nOF IMAGINATION\nTHAT when a thing lies still, unless somewhat else stir it, it will lie still for ever, is a truth that no man doubts of.\nBut that when a thing is in motion, it will eternally be in motion, unless somewhat else stay it, though the reason be\nthe same (namely, that nothing can change itself), is not so easily assented to. For men measure, not only other men,\n\nbut all other things, by themselves: and because they find themselves subject after motion to pain and lassitude,\nthink everything else grows weary of motion, and seeks repose of its own accord; little considering whether it be not\nsome other motion wherein that desire of rest they find in themselves consists. From hence it is that the schools say,\nheavy bodies fall downwards out of an appetite to rest, and to conserve their nature in that place which is most\nproper for them; ascribing appetite, and knowledge of what is good for their conservation (which is more than man\nhas), to things inanimate, absurdly.\nWhen a body is once in motion, it moves (unless something else hinder it) eternally; and whatsoever hinders it,\ncannot in an instant, but in time, and by degrees, quite extinguish it: and as we see in the water, though the wind\ncease, the waves give not over rolling for a long time after; so also it happens in that motion which is made in the\ninternal parts of a man, then, when he sees, dreams, etc. For after the object is removed, or the eye shut, we still\nretain an image of the thing seen, though more obscure than when we see it. And this is it the Latins call\nimagination, from the image made in seeing, and apply the same, though improperly, to all the other senses. But the\nGreeks call it fancy, which signifies appearance, and is as proper to one sense as to another. Imagination, therefore,\nis nothing but decaying sense; and is found in men and many other living creatures, as well sleeping as waking.\nCHAPTER III\nOF THE CONSEQUENCE OR TRAIN OF IMAGINATIONS\n. . . A sign is the event antecedent of the consequent; and contrarily, the consequent of the antecedent, when the like\nconsequences have been observed before: and the oftener they have been observed, the less uncertain is the sign.\nAnd therefore he that has most experience in any kind of business has most signs whereby to guess at the future\ntime, and consequently is the most prudent: and so much more prudent than he that is new in that kind of business,\nas not to be equaled by any advantage of natural and extemporary wit, though perhaps many young men think the\ncontrary.\nNevertheless, it is not prudence that distinguishes man from beast. There be beasts that at a year old observe more\nand pursue that which is for their good more prudently than a child can do at ten. . . .\n[Excepting prudence,] there is no other act of man's mind, that I can remember, naturally planted in him, so as to\nneed no other thing to the exercise of it but to be born a man, and live with the use of his five senses. Those other\nfaculties, of which I shall speak by and by, and which seem proper to man only, are acquired and increased by study\nand industry, and of most men learned by instruction and discipline, and proceed all from the invention of words and\nspeech. For besides sense, and thoughts, and the train of thoughts, the mind of man has no other motion; though by\nthe help of speech, and method, the same faculties may be improved to such a height as to distinguish men from all\nother living creatures.\nWhatsoever we imagine is finite. Therefore there is no idea or conception of anything we call infinite. No man can\nhave in his mind an image of infinite magnitude; nor conceive infinite swiftness, infinite time, or infinite force, or\ninfinite power. When we say anything is infinite, we signify only that we are not able to conceive the ends and\nbounds of the thing named, having no conception of the thing, but of our own inability. And therefore the name of\nGod is used, not to make us conceive Him (for He is incomprehensible, and His greatness and power are\ninconceivable), but that we may honor Him. Also because whatsoever, as I said before, we conceive has been\nperceived first by sense, either all at once, or by parts, a man can have no thought representing anything not subject\nto sense. No man therefore can conceive anything, but he must conceive it in some place; and endued with some\ndeterminate magnitude; and which may be divided into parts; nor that anything is all in this place, and all in another\nplace at the same time; nor that two or more things can be in one and the same place at once: for none of these things\never have or can be incident to sense, but are absurd speeches, taken upon credit, without any signification at all,\nfrom deceived philosophers and deceived, or deceiving, Schoolmen.\nCHAPTER IV\nOF SPEECH\nTHE INVENTION of printing, though ingenious, compared with the invention of letters is no great matter. But who\n\nwas the first that found the use of letters is not known. . . . But the most noble and profitable invention of all other\nwas that of speech, consisting of names or appellations, and their connection; whereby men register their thoughts,\nrecall them when they are past, and also declare them one to another for mutual utility and conversation; without\nwhich there had been amongst men neither Commonwealth, nor society, nor contract, nor peace, no more than\namongst lions, bears, and wolves. . . .\nThe general use of speech is to transfer our mental discourse into verbal, or the train of our thoughts into a train of\nwords, and that for two commodities; whereof one is the registering of the consequences of our thoughts, which\nbeing apt to slip out of our memory and put us to a new labor, may again be recalled by such words as they were\nmarked by. So that the first use of names is to serve for marks or notes of remembrance. Another is when many use\nthe same words to signify, by their connection and order one to another, what they conceive or think of each matter;\nand also what they desire, fear, or have any other passion for. And for this use they are called signs. Special uses of\nspeech are these: first, to register what by cogitation we find to be the cause of anything, present or past; and what\nwe find things present or past may produce, or effect; which, in sum, is acquiring of arts. Secondly, to show to\nothers that knowledge which we have attained; which is to counsel and teach one another. Thirdly, to make known\nto others our wills and purposes that we may have the mutual help of one another. Fourthly, to please and delight\nourselves, and others, by playing with our words, for pleasure or ornament, innocently.\nTo these uses, there are also four correspondent abuses. First, when men register their thoughts wrong by the\ninconstancy of the signification of their words; by which they register for their conceptions that which they never\nconceived, and so deceive themselves. Secondly, when they use words metaphorically; that is, in other sense than\nthat they are ordained for, and thereby deceive others. Thirdly, when by words they declare that to be their will\nwhich is not. Fourthly, when they use them to grieve one another: for seeing nature hath armed living creatures,\nsome with teeth, some with horns, and some with hands, to grieve an enemy, it is but an abuse of speech to grieve\nhim with the tongue, unless it be one whom we are obliged to govern; and then it is not to grieve, but to correct and\namend.\nThe manner how speech serves to the remembrance of the consequence of causes and effects consists in the\nimposing of names, and the connection of them. Of names, some are proper, and singular to one only thing; as\nPeter, John, this man, this tree: and some are common to many things; as man, horse, tree; every of which, though\nbut one name, is nevertheless the name of diverse particular things; in respect of all which together, it is called a\nuniversal, there being nothing in the world universal but names; for the things named are every one of them\nindividual and singular. . . .\nSeeing then that truth consists in the right ordering of names in our affirmations, a man that seeks precise truth had\nneed to remember what every name he uses stands for, and to place it accordingly; or else he will find himself\nentangled in words, as a bird in lime twigs; the more he struggles, the more belimed. And therefore in geometry\n(which is the only science that it hath pleased God hitherto to bestow on mankind), men begin at settling the\nsignifications of their words; which settling of significations, they call definitions, and place them in the beginning\nof their reckoning.\nBy this it appears how necessary it is for any man that aspires to true knowledge to examine the definitions of\nformer authors; and either to correct them, where they are negligently set down, or to make them himself. For the\nerrors of definitions multiply themselves, according as the reckoning proceeds, and lead men into absurdities, which\nat last they see, but cannot avoid, without reckoning anew from the beginning; in which lies the foundation of their\nerrors. From whence it happens that they which trust to books do as they that cast up many little sums into a greater,\nwithout considering whether those little sums were rightly cast up or not; and at last finding the error visible, and not\nmistrusting their first grounds, know not which way to clear themselves, spend time in fluttering over their books; as\nbirds that entering by the chimney, and finding themselves enclosed in a chamber, flutter at the false light of a glass\nwindow, for want of wit to consider which way they came in. So that in the right definition of names lies the first\nuse of speech; which is the acquisition of science: and in wrong, or no definitions, lies the first abuse; from which\nproceed all false and senseless tenets; which make those men that take their instruction from the authority of books,\nand not from their own meditation, to be as much below the condition of ignorant men as men endued with true\nscience are above it. . . .\nWhat kinds of speeches signify the appetites, aversions, and passions of man's mind, and of their use and abuse, I\n\nshall speak when I have spoken of the passions.\nThe names of such things as affect us, that is, which please and displease us, because all men be not alike affected\nwith the same thing, nor the same man at all times, are in the common discourses of men of inconstant signification.\nFor seeing all names are imposed to signify our conceptions, and all our affections are but conceptions; when we\nconceive the same things differently, we can hardly avoid different naming of them. For though the nature of that we\nconceive be the same; yet the diversity of our reception of it, in respect of different constitutions of body and\nprejudices of opinion, gives everything a tincture of our different passions. And therefore in reasoning, a man must\ntake heed of words; which, besides the signification of what we imagine of their nature, have a signification also of\nthe nature, disposition, and interest of the speaker; such as are the names of virtues and vices: for one man calls\nwisdom what another calls fear; and one cruelty what another justice; one prodigality what another magnanimity;\nand one gravity what another stupidity, etc. And therefore such names can never be true grounds of any\nratiocination. No more can metaphors and tropes of speech: but these are less dangerous because they profess their\ninconstancy, which the other do not.\nCHAPTER V\nOF REASON AND SCIENCE\nWHEN man reasons, he does nothing else but conceive a sum total, from addition of parcels; or conceive a\nremainder, from subtraction of one sum from another: which, if it be done by words, is conceiving of the\nconsequence of the names of all the parts, to the name of the whole; or from the names of the whole and one part, to\nthe name of the other part. And though in some things, as in numbers, besides adding and subtracting, men name\nother operations, as multiplying and dividing; yet they are the same: for multiplication is but adding together of\nthings equal; and division, but subtracting of one thing, as often as we can. These operations are not incident to\nnumbers only, but to all manner of things that can be added together, and taken one out of another. . . Writers of\npolitics add together pacts to find men's duties; and lawyers, laws and facts to find what is right and wrong in the\nactions of private men. In sum, in what matter soever there is place for addition and subtraction, there also is place\nfor reason; and where these have no place, there reason has nothing at all to do.\nOut of all which we may define (that is to say determine) what that is which is meant by this word reason when we\nreckon it amongst the faculties of the mind. For reason, in this sense, is nothing but reckoning (that is, adding and\nsubtracting) of the consequences of general names agreed upon for the marking and signifying of our thoughts; I say\nmarking them, when we reckon by ourselves; and signifying, when we demonstrate or approve our reckonings to\nother men.\nAnd as in arithmetic unpracticed men must, and professors themselves may often, err, and cast up false; so also in\nany other subject of reasoning, the ablest, most attentive, and most practice men may deceive themselves, and infer\nfalse conclusions; not but that reason itself is always right reason, as well as arithmetic is a certain and infallible art:\nbut no one man's reason, nor the reason of any one number of men, makes the certainty; no more than an account is\ntherefore well cast up because a great many men have unanimously approved it. . . .\nThe use and end of reason is not the finding of the sum and truth of one, or a few consequences, remote from the\nfirst definitions and settled significations of names; but to begin at these, and proceed from one consequence to\nanother. For there can be no certainty of the last conclusion without a certainty of all those affirmations and\nnegations on which it was grounded and inferred. As when a master of a family, in taking an account, casts up the\nsums of all the bills of expense into one sum; and not regarding how each bill is summed up, by those that give them\nin account, nor what it is he pays for, he advantages himself no more than if he allowed the account in gross, trusting\nto every of the accountant's skill and honesty: so also in reasoning of all other things, he that takes up conclusions on\nthe trust of authors, and doth not fetch them from the first items in every reckoning (which are the significations of\nnames settled by definitions), loses his labor, and does not know anything, but only believes.\nWhen a man reckons without the use of words, which may be done in particular things, as when upon the sight of\nany one thing, we conjecture what was likely to have preceded, or is likely to follow upon it; if that which he\nthought likely to follow follows not, or that which he thought likely to have preceded it hath not preceded it, this is\ncalled error; to which even the most prudent men are subject. But when we reason in words of general signification,\n\nand fall upon a general inference which is false; though it be commonly called error, it is indeed an absurdity, or\nsenseless speech. For error is but a deception, in presuming that somewhat is past, or to come; of which, though it\nwere not past, or not to come, yet there was no impossibility discoverable. But when we make a general assertion,\nunless it be a true one, the possibility of it is inconceivable. And words whereby we conceive nothing but the sound\nare those we call absurd, insignificant, and nonsense. And therefore if a man should talk to me of a round\nquadrangle; or accidents of bread in cheese; or immaterial substances; or of a free subject; a free will; or any free but\nfree from being hindered by opposition; I should not say he were in an error, but that his words were without\nmeaning; that is to say, absurd. . . .\n[Mankind excels] all other animals in this faculty, that when he conceived anything whatsoever, he was apt to\nenquire the consequences of it, and what effects he could do with it. And now I add this other degree of the same\nexcellence, that he can by words reduce the consequences he finds to general rules, called theorems, or aphorisms;\nthat is, he can reason, or reckon, not only in number, but in all other things whereof one may be added unto or\nsubtracted from another. But this privilege is allayed by another; and that is by the privilege of absurdity, to which\nno living creature is subject, but men only.\nCHAPTER VI\nOF THE INTERIOR BEGINNINGS OF VOLUNTARY MOTIONS, COMMONLY CALLED THE PASSIONS; AND\nTHE SPEECHES BY WHICH THEY ARE EXPRESSED\nTHERE be in animals two sorts of motions peculiar to them: One called vital, begun in generation, and continued\nwithout interruption through their whole life; such as are the course of the blood, the pulse, the breathing, the\nconcoction, nutrition, excretion, etc.; to which motions there needs no help of imagination: the other is animal\nmotion, otherwise called voluntary motion; as to go, to speak, to move any of our limbs, in such manner as is first\nfancied in our minds. . . . And because going, speaking, and the like voluntary motions depend always upon a\nprecedent thought of whither, which way, and what, it is evident that the imagination is the first internal beginning\nof all voluntary motion. And although unstudied men do not conceive any motion at all to be there, where the thing\nmoved is invisible, or the space it is moved in is, for the shortness of it, insensible; yet that doth not hinder but that\nsuch motions are. For let a space be never so little, that which is moved over a greater space, whereof that little one\nis part, must first be moved over that. These small beginnings of motion within the body of man, before they appear\nin walking, speaking, striking, and other visible actions, are commonly called endeavor.\nThis endeavor, when it is toward something which causes it, is called appetite, or desire, the latter being the general\nname, and the other oftentimes restrained to signify the desire of food, namely hunger and thirst. And when the\nendeavor is from ward something, it is generally called aversion. . . . That which men desire they are said to love,\nand to hate those things for which they have aversion. So that desire and love are the same thing; save that by desire,\nwe signify the absence of the object; by love, most commonly the presence of the same. So also by aversion, we\nsignify the absence; and by hate, the presence of the object.\nOf appetites and aversions, some are born with men; as appetite of food, appetite of excretion, and exoneration\n(which may also and more properly be called aversions, from somewhat they feel in their bodies), and some other\nappetites, not many. The rest, which are appetites of particular things, proceed from experience and trial of their\neffects upon themselves or other men. For of things we know not at all, or believe not to be, we can have no further\ndesire than to taste and try. But aversion we have for things, not only which we know have hurt us, but also that we\ndo not know whether they will hurt us, or not.\nThose things which we neither desire nor hate, we are said to contemn: contempt being nothing else but an\nimmobility or contumacy of the heart in resisting the action of certain things; and proceeding from that the heart is\nalready moved otherwise, by other more potent objects, or from want of experience of them.\nAnd because the constitution of a man's body is in continual mutation, it is impossible that all the same things\nshould always cause in him the same appetites and aversions: much less can all men consent in the desire of almost\nany one and the same object.\nBut whatsoever is the object of any man's appetite or desire, that is it which he for his part calls good; and the object\n\nof his hate and aversion, evil; and of his contempt, vile and inconsiderable. For these words of good, evil, and\ncontemptible are ever used with relation to the person that uses them: there being nothing simply and absolutely so;\nnor any common rule of good and evil to be taken from the nature of the objects themselves; but from the person of\nthe man, where there is no Commonwealth; or, in a Commonwealth, from the person that represents it; or from an\narbitrator or judge, whom men disagreeing shall by consent set up and make his sentence the rule thereof. . . .\nAs in sense that which is really within us is, as I have said before, only motion, caused by the action of external\nobjects but in appearance; to the sight, light and color; to the ear, sound; to the nostril, odor, etc.: so, when the action\nof the same object is continued from the eyes, ears, and other organs to the heart, the real effect there is nothing but\nmotion, or endeavor; which consists in appetite or aversion to or from the object moving. But the appearance or\nsense of that motion is that we either call delight or trouble of mind.\nThis motion, which is called appetite, and for the appearance of it delight and pleasure, seems to be a corroboration\nof vital motion, and a help thereunto; and therefore such things as caused delight were not improperly called jucunda\n(a juvando), from helping or fortifying; and the contrary, molesta, offensive, from hindering and troubling the\nmotion vital.\nPleasure therefore, or delight, is the appearance or sense of good; and molestation or displeasure, the appearance or\nsense of evil. And consequently all appetite, desire, and love is accompanied with some delight more or less; and all\nhatred and aversion with more or less displeasure and offence. . . .\nWhen in the mind of man appetites and aversions, hopes and fears, concerning one and the same thing, arise\nalternately; and diverse good and evil consequences of the doing or omitting the thing propounded come\nsuccessively into our thoughts; so that sometimes we have an appetite to it, sometimes an aversion from it;\nsometimes hope to be able to do it, sometimes despair, or fear to attempt it; the whole sum of desires, aversions,\nhopes and fears, continued till the thing be either done, or thought impossible, is that we call deliberation. . . .\nIn deliberation, the last appetite, or aversion, immediately adhering to the action, or to the omission thereof, is that\nwe call the will; the act, not the faculty, of willing. And beasts that have deliberation must necessarily also have will.\nThe definition of the will, given commonly by the Schools, that it is a rational appetite, is not good. For if it were,\nthen could there be no voluntary act against reason. For a voluntary act is that which proceeds from the will, and no\nother. But if instead of a rational appetite, we shall say an appetite resulting from a precedent deliberation, then the\ndefinition is the same that I have given here. Will, therefore, is the last appetite in deliberating. And though we say\nin common discourse, a man had a will once to do a thing, that nevertheless he forbore to do; yet that is properly but\nan inclination, which makes no action voluntary; because the action depends not of it, but of the last inclination, or\nappetite. For if the intervenient appetites make any action voluntary, then by the same reason all intervenient\naversions should make the same action involuntary; and so one and the same action should be both voluntary and\ninvoluntary. . . .\nContinual success in obtaining those things which a man from time to time desires, that is to say, continual\nprospering, is that men call felicity; I mean the felicity of this life. For there is no such thing as perpetual tranquillity\nof mind, while we live here; because life itself is but motion, and can never be without desire, nor without fear, no\nmore than without sense. What kind of felicity God hath ordained to them that devoutly honor him, a man shall no\nsooner know than enjoy; being joys that now are as incomprehensible as the word of Schoolmen, beatifical vision, is\nunintelligible. . . .\nCHAPTER XI\nOF THE DIFFERENCE OF MANNERS\nBY MANNERS, I mean not here decency of behavior; as how one man should salute another, or how a man should\nwash his mouth, or pick his teeth before company, and such other points of the small morals; but those qualities of\nmankind that concern their living together in peace and unity. To which end we are to consider that the felicity of\nthis life consists not in the repose of a mind satisfied. For there is no such finis ultimus (utmost aim) nor summum\nbonum (greatest good) as is spoken of in the books of the old moral philosophers. Nor can a man any more live\nwhose desires are at an end than he whose senses and imaginations are at a stand. Felicity is a continual progress of\n\nthe desire from one object to another, the attaining of the former being still but the way to the latter. The cause\nwhereof is that the object of man's desire is not to enjoy once only, and for one instant of time, but to assure forever\nthe way of his future desire. And therefore the voluntary actions and inclinations of all men tend not only to the\nprocuring, but also to the assuring of a contented life, and differ only in the way, which arises partly from the\ndiversity of passions in diverse men, and partly from the difference of the knowledge or opinion each one has of the\ncauses which produce the effect desired.\nSo that in the first place, I put for a general inclination of all mankind a perpetual and restless desire of power after\npower, that ceases only in death. And the cause of this is not always that a man hopes for a more intensive delight\nthan he has already attained to, or that he cannot be content with a moderate power, but because he cannot assure the\npower and means to live well, which he hath present, without the acquisition of more. And from hence it is that\nkings, whose power is greatest, turn their endeavors to the assuring it at home by laws, or abroad by wars: and when\nthat is done, there succeeds a new desire; in some, of fame from new conquest; in others, of ease and sensual\npleasure; in others, of admiration, or being flattered for excellence in some art or other ability of the mind. . . .\nIgnorance of the causes, and original constitution of right, equity, law, and justice, disposes a man to make custom\nand example the rule of his actions; in such manner as to think that unjust which it hath been the custom to punish;\nand that just, of the impunity and approbation whereof they can produce an example or (as the lawyers which only\nuse this false measure of justice barbarously call it) a precedent; like little children that have no other rule of good\nand evil manners but the correction they receive from their parents and masters; save that children are constant to\ntheir rule, whereas men are not so; because grown strong and stubborn, they appeal from custom to reason, and from\nreason to custom, as it serves their turn, receding from custom when their interest requires it, and setting themselves\nagainst reason as oft as reason is against them: which is the cause that the doctrine of right and wrong is perpetually\ndisputed, both by the pen and the sword: whereas the doctrine of lines and figures is not so; because men care not, in\nthat subject, what be truth, as a thing that crosses no man's ambition, profit, or lust. For I doubt not, but if it had been\na thing contrary to any man's right of dominion, or to the interest of men that have dominion, that the three angles of\na triangle should be equal to two angles of a square, that doctrine should have been, if not disputed, yet by the\nburning of all books of geometry suppressed, as far as he whom it concerned was able. . . .\nCHAPTER XIII\nOF THE NATURAL CONDITION OF MANKIND AS CONCERNING THEIR FELICITY AND MISERY\nNATURE hath made men so equal in the faculties of body and mind as that, though there be found one man\nsometimes manifestly stronger in body or of quicker mind than another, yet when all is reckoned together the\ndifference between man and man is not so considerable as that one man can thereupon claim to himself any benefit\nto which another may not pretend as well as he. For as to the strength of body, the weakest has strength enough to\nkill the strongest, either by secret machination or by confederacy with others that are in the same danger with\nhimself.\nAnd as to the faculties of the mind, setting aside the arts grounded upon words, and especially that skill of\nproceeding upon general and infallible rules, called science, which very few have and but in few things, as being not\na native faculty born with us, nor attained, as prudence, while we look after somewhat else, I find yet a greater\nequality amongst men than that of strength. For prudence is but experience, which equal time equally bestows on all\nmen in those things they equally apply themselves unto. That which may perhaps make such equality incredible is\nbut a vain conceit of one's own wisdom, which almost all men think they have in a greater degree than the vulgar;\nthat is, than all men but themselves, and a few others, whom by fame, or for concurring with themselves, they\napprove. For such is the nature of men that howsoever they may acknowledge many others to be more witty, or\nmore eloquent or more learned, yet they will hardly believe there be many so wise as themselves; for they see their\nown wit at hand, and other men's at a distance. But this proves rather that men are in that point equal, than unequal.\nFor there is not ordinarily a greater sign of the equal distribution of anything than that every man is contented with\nhis share.\nFrom this equality of ability arises equality of hope in the attaining of our ends. And therefore if any two men desire\nthe same thing, which nevertheless they cannot both enjoy, they become enemies; and in the way to their end (which\nis principally their own conservation, and sometimes their delectation only) endeavor to destroy or subdue one\n\nanother. And from hence it comes to pass that where an invader hath no more to fear than another man's single\npower, if one plant, sow, build, or possess a convenient seat, others may probably be expected to come prepared\nwith forces united to dispossess and deprive him, not only of the fruit of his labor, but also of his life or liberty. And\nthe invader again is in the like danger of another.\nAnd from this diffidence of one another, there is no way for any man to secure himself so reasonable as anticipation;\nthat is, by force, or wiles, to master the persons of all men he can so long till he see no other power great enough to\nendanger him: and this is no more than his own conservation requires, and is generally allowed. Also, because there\nbe some that, taking pleasure in contemplating their own power in the acts of conquest, which they pursue farther\nthan their security requires, if others, that otherwise would be glad to be at ease within modest bounds, should not by\ninvasion increase their power, they would not be able, long time, by standing only on their defense, to subsist. And\nby consequence, such augmentation of dominion over men being necessary to a man's conservation, it ought to be\nallowed him.\nAgain, men have no pleasure (but on the contrary a great deal of grief) in keeping company where there is no power\nable to overawe them all. For every man looks that his companion should value him at the same rate he sets upon\nhimself, and upon all signs of contempt or undervaluing naturally endeavors, as far as he dares (which amongst them\nthat have no common power to keep them in quiet is far enough to make them destroy each other), to extort a greater\nvalue from his contemners, by damage; and from others, by the example.\nSo that in the nature of man, we find three principal causes of quarrel. First, competition; secondly, diffidence;\nthirdly, glory.\nThe first makes men invade for gain; the second, for safety; and the third, for reputation. The first use violence, to\nmake themselves masters of other men's persons, wives, children, and cattle; the second, to defend them; the third,\nfor trifles, as a word, a smile, a different opinion, and any other sign of undervalue, either direct in their persons or\nby reflection in their kindred, their friends, their nation, their profession, or their name.\nHereby it is manifest that during the time men live without a common power to keep them all in awe, they are in that\ncondition which is called war; and such a war as is of every man against every man. For war consists not in battle\nonly, or the act of fighting, but in a tract of time, wherein the will to contend by battle is sufficiently known: and\ntherefore the notion of time is to be considered in the nature of war, as it is in the nature of weather. For as the nature\nof foul weather lies not in a shower or two of rain, but in an inclination thereto of many days together: so the nature\nof war consists not in actual fighting, but in the known disposition thereto during all the time there is no assurance to\nthe contrary. All other time is peace.\nWhatsoever therefore is consequent to a time of war, where every man is enemy to every man, the same consequent\nto the time wherein men live without other security than what their own strength and their own invention shall\nfurnish them withal. In such condition there is no place for industry, because the fruit thereof is uncertain: and\nconsequently no culture of the earth; no navigation, nor use of the commodities that may be imported by sea; no\ncommodious building; no instruments of moving and removing such things as require much force; no knowledge of\nthe face of the earth; no account of time; no arts; no letters; no society; and which is worst of all, continual fear, and\ndanger of violent death; and the life of man, solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.\nIt may seem strange to some man that has not well weighed these things that Nature should thus dissociate and\nrender men apt to invade and destroy one another: and he may therefore, not trusting to this inference, made from\nthe passions, desire perhaps to have the same confirmed by experience. Let him therefore consider with himself:\nwhen taking a journey, he arms himself and seeks to go well accompanied; when going to sleep, he locks his doors;\nwhen even in his house he locks his chests; and this when he knows there be laws and public officers, armed, to\nrevenge all injuries shall be done him; what opinion he has of his fellow subjects, when he rides armed; of his fellow\ncitizens, when he locks his doors; and of his children, and servants, when he locks his chests. Does he not there as\nmuch accuse mankind by his actions as I do by my words? But neither of us accuse man's nature in it. The desires,\nand other passions of man, are in themselves no sin. No more are the actions that proceed from those passions till\nthey know a law that forbids them; which till laws be made they cannot know, nor can any law be made till they\nhave agreed upon the person that shall make it.\nIt may peradventure be thought there was never such a time nor condition of war as this; and I believe it was never\n\ngenerally so, over all the world: but there are many places where they live so now. For the savage people in many\nplaces of America, except the government of small families, the concord whereof depends on natural lust, have no\ngovernment at all, and live at this day in that brutish manner, as I said before. Howsoever, it may be perceived what\nmanner of life there would be, where there were no common power to fear, by the manner of life which men that\nhave formerly lived under a peaceful government use to degenerate into a civil war.\nBut though there had never been any time wherein particular men were in a condition of war one against another, yet\nin all times kings and persons of sovereign authority, because of their independency, are in continual jealousies, and\nin the state and posture of gladiators, having their weapons pointing, and their eyes fixed on one another; that is,\ntheir forts, garrisons, and guns upon the frontiers of their kingdoms, and continual spies upon their neighbors, which\nis a posture of war. But because they uphold thereby the industry of their subjects, there does not follow from it that\nmisery which accompanies the liberty of particular men.\nTo this war of every man against every man, this also is consequent; that nothing can be unjust. The notions of right\nand wrong, justice and injustice, have there no place. Where there is no common power, there is no law; where no\nlaw, no injustice. Force and fraud are in war the two cardinal virtues. Justice and injustice are none of the faculties\nneither of the body nor mind. If they were, they might be in a man that were alone in the world, as well as his senses\nand passions. They are qualities that relate to men in society, not in solitude. It is consequent also to the same\ncondition that there be no propriety, no dominion, no mine and thine distinct; but only that to be every man's that he\ncan get, and for so long as he can keep it. And thus much for the ill condition which man by mere nature is actually\nplaced in; though with a possibility to come out of it, consisting partly in the passions, partly in his reason.\nThe passions that incline men to peace are: fear of death; desire of such things as are necessary to commodious\nliving; and a hope by their industry to obtain them. And reason suggests convenient articles of peace upon which\nmen may be drawn to agreement. These articles are they which otherwise are called the laws of nature, whereof I\nshall speak more particularly in the two following chapters.\nCHAPTER XIV\nOF THE FIRST AND SECOND NATURAL LAWS, AND OF CONTRACTS\nTHE right of nature, which writers commonly call jus naturale, is the liberty each man hath to use his own power as\nhe will himself for the preservation of his own nature; that is to say, of his own life; and consequently, of doing\nanything which, in his own judgement and reason, he shall conceive to be the aptest means thereunto.\nBy liberty is understood, according to the proper signification of the word, the absence of external impediments;\nwhich impediments may oft take away part of a man's power to do what he would, but cannot hinder him from using\nthe power left him according as his judgement and reason shall dictate to him.\nA law of nature, lex naturalis, is a precept, or general rule, found out by reason, by which a man is forbidden to do\nthat which is destructive of his life, or takes away the means of preserving the same, and to omit that by which he\nthinks it may be best preserved. For though they that speak of this subject use to confound jus and lex, right and law,\nyet they ought to be distinguished, because right consists in liberty to do, or to forbear; whereas law determines and\nbinds to one of them: so that law and right differ as much as obligation and liberty, which in one and the same\nmatter are inconsistent.\nAnd because the condition of man (as hath been declared in the precedent chapter) is a condition of war of every one\nagainst every one, in which case every one is governed by his own reason, and there is nothing he can make use of\nthat may not be a help unto him in preserving his life against his enemies; it follows that in such a condition every\nman has a right to every thing, even to one another's body. And therefore, as long as this natural right of every man\nto every thing endures, there can be no security to any man, how strong or wise soever he be, of living out the time\nwhich nature ordinarily allows men to live. And consequently it is a precept, or general rule of reason: that every\nman ought to endeavor peace, as far as he has hope of obtaining it; and when he cannot obtain it, that he may seek\nand use all helps and advantages of war. The first branch of which rule contains the first and fundamental law of\nnature, which is: to seek peace and follow it. The second, the sum of the right of nature, which is: by all means we\n\ncan to defend ourselves.\nFrom this fundamental law of nature, by which men are commanded to endeavor peace, is derived this second law:\nthat a man be willing, when others are so too, as far forth as for peace and defense of himself he shall think it\nnecessary, to lay down this right to all things; and be contented with so much liberty against other men as he would\nallow other men against himself. For as long as every man holds this right, of doing anything he likes; so long are all\nmen in the condition of war. But if other men will not lay down their right, as well as he, then there is no reason for\nanyone to divest himself of his: for that were to expose himself to prey, which no man is bound to, rather than to\ndispose himself to peace. This is that law of the gospel: Whatsoever you require that others should do to you, that do\nyou to them. And that law of all men, quod tibi fieri non vis, alteri ne feceris.\nTo lay down a man's right to anything is to divest himself of the liberty of hindering another of the benefit of his\nown right to the same. For he that renounces or passes away his right gives not to any other man a right which he\nhad not before, because there is nothing to which every man had not right by nature, but only stands out of his way\nthat he may enjoy his own original right without hindrance from him, not without hindrance from another. So that\nthe effect which redounds to one man by another man's defect of right is but so much diminution of impediments to\nthe use of his own right original.\nRight is laid aside, either by simply renouncing it, or by transferring it to another. By simply renouncing, when he\ncares not to whom the benefit thereof redounds. By transferring, when he intends the benefit thereof to some certain\nperson or persons. And when a man hath in either manner abandoned or granted away his right, then is he said to be\nobliged, or bound, not to hinder those to whom such right is granted, or abandoned, from the benefit of it: and that\nhe ought, and it is duty, not to make void that voluntary act of his own: and that such hindrance is injustice, and\ninjury, as being sine jure; the right being before renounced or transferred. So that injury or injustice, in the\ncontroversies of the world, is somewhat like to that which in the disputations of scholars is called absurdity. For as it\nis there called an absurdity to contradict what one maintained in the beginning; so in the world it is called injustice,\nand injury voluntarily to undo that which from the beginning he had voluntarily done. The way by which a man\neither simply renounces or transfers his right is a declaration, or signification, by some voluntary and sufficient sign,\nor signs, that he doth so renounce or transfer, or hath so renounced or transferred the same, to him that accepts it.\nAnd these signs are either words only, or actions only; or, as it happens most often, both words and actions. And the\nsame are the bonds, by which men are bound and obliged: bonds that have their strength, not from their own nature\n(for nothing is more easily broken than a man's word), but from fear of some evil consequence upon the rupture.\nWhensoever a man transfers his right, or renounces it, it is either in consideration of some right reciprocally\ntransferred to himself, or for some other good he hopes for thereby. For it is a voluntary act: and of the voluntary\nacts of every man, the object is some good to himself. And therefore there be some rights which no man can be\nunderstood by any words, or other signs, to have abandoned or transferred. As first a man cannot lay down the right\nof resisting them that assault him by force to take away his life, because he cannot be understood to aim thereby at\nany good to himself. The same may be said of wounds, and chains, and imprisonment, both because there is no\nbenefit consequent to such patience, as there is to the patience of suffering another to be wounded or imprisoned, as\nalso because a man cannot tell when he sees men proceed against him by violence whether they intend his death or\nnot. And lastly the motive and end for which this renouncing and transferring of right is introduced is nothing else\nbut the security of a man's person, in his life, and in the means of so preserving life as not to be weary of it. And\ntherefore if a man by words, or other signs, seem to despoil himself of the end for which those signs were intended,\nhe is not to be understood as if he meant it, or that it was his will, but that he was ignorant of how such words and\nactions were to be interpreted.\nThe mutual transferring of right is that which men call contract.\nThere is difference between transferring of right to the thing, the thing, and transferring or tradition, that is, delivery\nof the thing itself. For the thing may be delivered together with the translation of the right, as in buying and selling\nwith ready money, or exchange of goods or lands, and it may be delivered some time after.\nAgain, one of the contractors may deliver the thing contracted for on his part, and leave the other to perform his part\nat some determinate time after, and in the meantime be trusted; and then the contract on his part is called pact, or\ncovenant: or both parts may contract now to perform hereafter, in which cases he that is to perform in time to come,\n\nbeing trusted, his performance is called keeping of promise, or faith, and the failing of performance, if it be\nvoluntary, violation of faith.\nWhen the transferring of right is not mutual, but one of the parties transfers in hope to gain thereby friendship or\nservice from another, or from his friends; or in hope to gain the reputation of charity, or magnanimity; or to deliver\nhis mind from the pain of compassion; or in hope of reward in heaven; this is not contract, but gift, free gift, grace:\nwhich words signify one and the same thing. . . .\nIf a covenant be made wherein neither of the parties perform presently, but trust one another, in the condition of\nmere nature (which is a condition of war of every man against every man) upon any reasonable suspicion, it is void:\nbut if there be a common power set over them both, with right and force sufficient to compel performance, it is not\nvoid. For he that performs first has no assurance the other will perform after, because the bonds of words are too\nweak to bridle men's ambition, avarice, anger, and other passions, without the fear of some coercive power; which in\nthe condition of mere nature, where all men are equal, and judges of the justness of their own fears, cannot possibly\nbe supposed. And therefore he which performs first does but betray himself to his enemy, contrary to the right he\ncan never abandon of defending his life and means of living.\nBut in a civil estate, where there a power set up to constrain those that would otherwise violate their faith, that fear is\nno more reasonable; and for that cause, he which by the covenant is to perform first is obliged so to do.\nThe cause of fear, which makes such a covenant invalid, must be always something arising after the covenant made,\nas some new fact or other sign of the will not to perform, else it cannot make the covenant void. For that which\ncould not hinder a man from promising ought not to be admitted as a hindrance of performing.\nHe that transfers any right transfers the means of enjoying it, as far as lies in his power. As he that sells land is\nunderstood to transfer the herbage and whatsoever grows upon it; nor can he that sells a mill turn away the stream\nthat drives it. And they that give to a man the right of government in sovereignty are understood to give him the\nright of levying money to maintain soldiers, and of appointing magistrates for the administration of justice. . . .\nMen are freed of their covenants two ways; by performing, or by being forgiven. For performance is the natural end\nof obligation, and forgiveness the restitution of liberty, as being a retransferring of that right in which the obligation\nconsisted.\nCovenants entered into by fear, in the condition of mere nature, are obligatory. For example, if I covenant to pay a\nransom, or service for my life, to an enemy, I am bound by it. For it is a contract, wherein one receives the benefit of\nlife; the other is to receive money, or service for it, and consequently, where no other law (as in the condition of\nmere nature) forbids the performance, the covenant is valid. Therefore prisoners of war, if trusted with the payment\nof their ransom, are obliged to pay it: and if a weaker prince make a disadvantageous peace with a stronger, for fear,\nhe is bound to keep it; unless (as hath been said before) there arises some new and just cause of fear to renew the\nwar. And even in Commonwealths, if I be forced to redeem myself from a thief by promising him money, I am\nbound to pay it, till the civil law discharge me. For whatsoever I may lawfully do without obligation, the same I may\nlawfully covenant to do through fear: and what I lawfully covenant, I cannot lawfully break. . . .\nThe force of words being (as I have formerly noted) too weak to hold men to the performance of their covenants,\nthere are in man's nature but two imaginable helps to strengthen it. And those are either a fear of the consequence of\nbreaking their word, or a glory or pride in appearing not to need to break it. This latter is a generosity too rarely\nfound to be presumed on, especially in the pursuers of wealth, command, or sensual pleasure, which are the greatest\npart of mankind. The passion to be reckoned upon is fear; whereof there be two very general objects: one, the power\nof spirits invisible; the other, the power of those men they shall therein offend. Of these two, though the former be\nthe greater power, yet the fear of the latter is commonly the greater fear. . . .\nIt appears also that the oath adds nothing to the obligation. For a covenant, if lawful, binds in the sight of God,\nwithout the oath, as much as with it; if unlawful, binds not at all, though it be confirmed with an oath.\nCHAPTER XV\n\nOF OTHER LAWS OF NATURE\nFROM that law of nature by which we are obliged to transfer to another such rights as, being retained, hinder the\npeace of mankind, there follows a third; which is this: that men perform their covenants made; without which\ncovenants are in vain, and but empty words; and the right of all men to all things remaining, we are still in the\ncondition of war.\nAnd in this law of nature consists the fountain and original of justice. For where no covenant hath preceded, there\nhath no right been transferred, and every man has right to everything and consequently, no action can be unjust. But\nwhen a covenant is made, then to break it is unjust and the definition of injustice is no other than the not\nperformance of covenant. And whatsoever is not unjust is just.\nBut because covenants of mutual trust, where there is a fear of not performance on either part (as hath been said in\nthe former chapter), are invalid, though the original of justice be the making of covenants, yet injustice actually there\ncan be none till the cause of such fear be taken away; which, while men are in the natural condition of war, cannot\nbe done. Therefore before the names of just and unjust can have place, there must be some coercive power to\ncompel men equally to the performance of their covenants, by the terror of some punishment greater than the benefit\nthey expect by the breach of their covenant, and to make good that propriety which by mutual contract men acquire\nin recompense of the universal right they abandon: and such power there is none before the erection of a\nCommonwealth. And this is also to be gathered out of the ordinary definition of justice in the Schools, for they say\nthat justice is the constant will of giving to every man his own. And therefore where there is no own, that is, no\npropriety, there is no injustice; and where there is no coercive power erected, that is, where there is no\nCommonwealth, there is no property, all men having right to all things: therefore where there is no Commonwealth,\nthere nothing is unjust. So that the nature of justice consists in keeping of valid covenants, but the validity of\ncovenants begins not but with the constitution of a civil power sufficient to compel men to keep them: and then it is\nalso that property begins.\nThe fool hath said in his heart, there is no such thing as justice, and sometimes also with his tongue, seriously\nalleging that every man's conservation and contentment being committed to his own care, there could be no reason\nwhy every man might not do what he thought conduced thereunto: and therefore also to make, or not make; keep, or\nnot keep, covenants was not against reason when it conduced to one's benefit. He does not therein deny that there be\ncovenants; and that they are sometimes broken, sometimes kept; and that such breach of them may be called\ninjustice, and the observance of them justice: but he questions whether injustice, taking away the fear of God (for the\nsame fool hath said in his heart there is no God), not sometimes stand with that reason which dictates to every man\nhis own good; and particularly then, when it conduces to such a benefit as shall put a man in a condition to neglect\nnot only the dispraise and revilings, but also the power of other men. The kingdom of God is gotten by violence: but\nwhat if it could be gotten by unjust violence? Were it against reason so to get it, when it is impossible to receive hurt\nby it? And if it be not against reason, it is not against justice: or else justice is not to be approved for good. From\nsuch reasoning as this, successful wickedness hath obtained the name of virtue: and some that in all other things\nhave disallowed the violation of faith, yet have allowed it when it is for the getting of a kingdom. And the heathen\nthat believed that Saturn was deposed by his son Jupiter believed nevertheless the same Jupiter to be the avenger of\ninjustice, somewhat like to a piece of law in Coke's Commentaries on Littleton; where he says if the right heir of the\ncrown be attainted of treason, yet the crown shall descend to him, and eo instante the attainder be void: from which\ninstances a man will be very prone to infer that when the heir apparent of a kingdom shall kill him that is in\npossession, though his father, you may call it injustice, or by what other name you will; yet it can never be against\nreason, seeing all the voluntary actions of men tend to the benefit of themselves; and those actions are most\nreasonable that conduce most to their ends. This specious reasoning is nevertheless false.\nFor the question is not of promises mutual, where there is no security of performance on either side, as when there is\nno civil power erected over the parties promising; for such promises are no covenants: but either where one of the\nparties has performed already, or where there is a power to make him perform, there is the question whether it be\nagainst reason; that is, against the benefit of the other to perform, or not. And I say it is not against reason. For the\nmanifestation whereof we are to consider; first, that when a man doth a thing, which notwithstanding anything can\nbe foreseen and reckoned on tends to his own destruction, howsoever some accident, which he could not expect,\narriving may turn it to his benefit; yet such events do not make it reasonably or wisely done. Secondly, that in a\ncondition of war, wherein every man to every man, for want of a common power to keep them all in awe, is an\n\nenemy, there is no man can hope by his own strength, or wit, to himself from destruction without the help of\nconfederates; where every one expects the same defense by the confederation that any one else does: and therefore\nhe which declares he thinks it reason to deceive those that help him can in reason expect no other means of safety\nthan what can be had from his own single power. He, therefore, that breaks his covenant, and consequently declares\nthat he thinks he may with reason do so, cannot be received into any society that unite themselves for peace and\ndefense but by the error of them that receive him; nor when he is received be retained in it without seeing the danger\nof their error; which errors a man cannot reasonably reckon upon as the means of his security: and therefore if he be\nleft, or cast out of society, he perishes; and if he live in society, it is by the errors of other men, which he could not\nforesee nor reckon upon, and consequently against the reason of his preservation; and so, as all men that contribute\nnot to his destruction forbear him only out of ignorance of what is good for themselves. . . .\nAs justice depends on antecedent covenant; so does gratitude depend on antecedent grace; that is to say, antecedent\nfree gift; and is the fourth law of nature, which may be conceived in this form: that a man which receives benefit\nfrom another of mere grace endeavor that he which gives it have no reasonable cause to repent him of his good will.\nFor no man gives but with intention of good to himself, because gift is voluntary; and of all voluntary acts, the\nobject is to every man his own good; of which if men see they shall be frustrated, there will be no beginning of\nbenevolence or trust, nor consequently of mutual help, nor of reconciliation of one man to another; and therefore\nthey are to remain still in the condition of war, which is contrary to the first and fundamental law of nature which\ncommands men to seek peace. The breach of this law is called ingratitude, and hath the same relation to grace that\ninjustice hath to obligation by covenant. . . .\nThe question who is the better man has no place in the condition of mere nature, where (as has been shown before)\nall men are equal. The inequality that now is has been introduced by the laws civil. I know that Aristotle in the first\nbook of his Politics, for a foundation of his doctrine, makes men by nature, some more worthy to command,\nmeaning the wiser sort, such as he thought himself to be for his philosophy; others to serve, meaning those that had\nstrong bodies, but were not philosophers as he; as master and servant were not introduced by consent of men, but by\ndifference of wit: which is not only against reason, but also against experience. For there are very few so foolish that\nhad not rather govern themselves than be governed by others: nor when the wise, in their own conceit, contend by\nforce with them who distrust their own wisdom, do they always, or often, or almost at any time, get the victory. If\nnature therefore have made men equal, that equality is to be acknowledged: or if nature have made men unequal, yet\nbecause men that think themselves equal will not enter into conditions of peace, but upon equal terms, such equality\nmust be admitted. And therefore for [another] law of nature, I put this: that every man acknowledge another for his\nequal by nature. The breach of this precept is pride.\nOn this law depends another: that at the entrance into conditions of peace, no man require to reserve to himself any\nright which he is not content should he reserved to every one of the rest. As it is necessary for all men that seek\npeace to lay down certain rights of nature; that is to say, not to have liberty to do all they list, so is it necessary for\nman's life to retain some: as right to govern their own bodies; enjoy air, water, motion, ways to go from place to\nplace; and all things else without which a man cannot live, or not live well. If in this case, at the making of peace,\nmen require for themselves that which they would not have to be granted to others, they do contrary to the precedent\nlaw that commands the acknowledgment of natural equality, and therefore also against the law of nature. The\nobservers of this law are those we call modest, and the breakers arrogant men. The Greeks call the violation of this\nlaw pleonexia; that is, a desire of more than their share. . . .\nAnd seeing every man is presumed to do all things in order to his own benefit, no man is a fit arbitrator in his own\ncause: and if he were never so fit, yet equity allowing to each party equal benefit, if one be admitted to be judge, the\nother is to be admitted also; and so the controversy, that is, the cause of war, remains, against the law of nature.\nFor the same reason no man in any cause ought to be received for arbitrator to whom greater profit, or honor, or\npleasure apparently arises out of the victory of one party than of the other: for he hath taken, though an unavoidable\nbribe, yet a bribe; and no man can be obliged to trust him. And thus also the controversy and the condition of war\nremains, contrary to the law of nature.\nAnd in a controversy of fact, the judge being to give no more credit to one than to the other, if there be no other\narguments, must give credit to a third; or to a third and fourth; or more: for else the question is undecided, and left to\nforce, contrary to the law of nature.\n\nThese are the laws of nature, dictating peace, for a means of the conservation of men in multitudes; and which only\nconcern the doctrine of civil society. There be other things tending to the destruction of particular men; as\ndrunkenness, and all other parts of intemperance, which may therefore also be reckoned amongst those things which\nthe law of nature hath forbidden, but are not necessary to be mentioned, nor are pertinent enough to this place.\nAnd though this may seem too subtle a deduction of the laws of nature to be taken notice of by all men, whereof the\nmost part are too busy in getting food, and the rest too negligent to understand; yet to leave all men inexcusable,\nthey have been contracted into one easy sum, intelligible even to the meanest capacity; and that is: Do not that to\nanother which you would not have done to yourself, which shows him that he has no more to do in learning the laws\nof nature but, when weighing the actions of other men with his own they seem too heavy, to put them into the other\npart of the balance, and his own into their place, that his own passions and self-love may add nothing to the weight;\nand then there is none of these laws of nature that will not appear unto him very reasonable.\nThe laws of nature oblige in foro interno; that is to say, they bind to a desire they should take place: but in foro\nexterno; that is, to the putting them in act, not always. For he that should be modest and tractable, and perform all he\npromises in such time and place where no man else should do so, should but make himself a prey to others, and\nprocure his own certain ruin, contrary to the ground of all laws of nature which tend to nature's preservation. And\nagain, he that having sufficient security that others shall observe the same laws towards him, observes them not\nhimself, seeks not peace, but war, and consequently the destruction of his nature by violence. . . .\nThe laws of nature are immutable and eternal; for injustice, ingratitude, arrogance, pride, iniquity, acception of\npersons, and the rest can never be made lawful. For it can never be that war shall preserve life, and peace destroy it.\nThe same laws, because they oblige only to a desire and endeavor, mean an unfeigned and constant endeavor, are\neasy to be observed. For in that they require nothing but endeavor, he that endeavors their performance fulfills them;\nand he that fulfills the law is just.\nAnd the science of them is the true and only moral philosophy. For moral philosophy is nothing else but the science\nof what is good and evil in the conversation and society of mankind. Good and evil are names that signify our\nappetites and aversions, which in different tempers, customs, and doctrines of men are different: and diverse men\ndiffer not only in their judgement on the senses of what is pleasant and unpleasant to the taste, smell, hearing, touch,\nand sight; but also of what is conformable or disagreeable to reason in the actions of common life. Nay, the same\nman, in diverse times, differs from himself; and one time praises, that is, calls good, what another time he dispraises,\nand calls evil: from whence arise disputes, controversies, and at last war. And therefore so long as a man is in the\ncondition of mere nature, which is a condition of war, private appetite is the measure of good and evil: and\nconsequently all men agree on this, that peace is good, and therefore also the way or means of peace, which (as I\nhave shown before) are justice, gratitude, modesty, equity, mercy, and the rest of the laws of nature, are good; that is\nto say, moral virtues; and their contrary vices, evil. Now the science of virtue and vice is moral philosophy; and\ntherefore the true doctrine of the laws of nature is the true moral philosophy. But the writers of moral philosophy,\nthough they acknowledge the same virtues and vices; yet, not seeing wherein consisted their goodness, nor that they\ncome to be praised as the means of peaceable, sociable, and comfortable living, place them in a mediocrity of\npassions: as if not the cause, but the degree of daring, made fortitude; or not the cause, but the quantity of a gift,\nmade liberality.\nThese dictates of reason men used to call by the name of laws, but improperly: for they are but conclusions or\ntheorems concerning what conduces to the conservation and defense of themselves; whereas law, properly, is the\nword of him that by right hath command over others. But yet if we consider the same theorems as delivered in the\nword of God that by right commands all things, then are they properly called laws.\nCHAPTER XVIII\nOF THE RIGHTS OF SOVEREIGNS BY INSTITUTION\nA COMMONWEALTH is said to be instituted when a multitude of men do agree, and covenant, every one with\nevery one, that to whatsoever man, or assembly of men, shall be given by the major part the right to present the\n\nperson of them all, that is to say, to be their representative; every one, as well he that voted for it as he that voted\nagainst it, shall authorize all the actions and judgements of that man, or assembly of men, in the same manner as if\nthey were his own, to the end to live peaceably amongst themselves, and be protected against other men.\nFrom this institution of a Commonwealth are derived all the rights and faculties of him, or them, on whom the\nsovereign power is conferred by the consent of the people assembled.\nFirst, because they covenant, it is to be understood they are not obliged by former covenant to anything repugnant\nhereunto. And consequently they that have already instituted a Commonwealth, being thereby bound by covenant to\nown the actions and judgements of one, cannot lawfully make a new covenant amongst themselves to be obedient to\nany other, in anything whatsoever, without his permission. And therefore, they that are subjects to a monarch cannot\nwithout his leave cast off monarchy and return to the confusion of a disunited multitude; nor transfer their person\nfrom him that bears it to another man, other assembly of men: for they are bound, every man to every man, to own\nand be reputed author of all that already is their sovereign shall do and judge fit to be done; so that any one man\ndissenting, all the rest should break their covenant made to that man, which is injustice: and they have also every\nman given the sovereignty to him that bears their person; and therefore if they depose him, they take from him that\nwhich is his own, and so again it is injustice. Besides, if he that attempts to depose his sovereign be killed or\npunished by him for such attempt, he is author of his own punishment, as being, by the institution, author of all his\nsovereign shall do; and because it is injustice for a man to do anything for which he may be punished by his own\nauthority, he is also upon that title unjust. And whereas some men have pretended for their disobedience to their\nsovereign a new covenant, made, not with men but with God, this also is unjust: for there is no covenant with God\nbut by mediation of somebody that represents God's person, which none doth but God's lieutenant who hath the\nsovereignty under God. But this pretense of covenant with God is so evident a lie, even in the pretenders' own\nconsciences, that it is not only an act of an unjust, but also of a vile and unmanly disposition.\nSecondly, because the right of bearing the person of them all is given to him they make sovereign, by covenant only\nof one to another, and not of him to any of them, there can happen no breach of covenant on the part of the\nsovereign; and consequently none of his subjects, by any pretense of forfeiture, can be freed from his subjection.\nThat he which is made sovereign makes no covenant with his subjects before hand is manifest; because either he\nmust make it with the whole multitude, as one party to the covenant, or he must make a several covenant with every\nman. With the whole, as one party, it is impossible, because as they are not one person: and if he make so many\nseveral covenants as there be men, those covenants after he hath the sovereignty are void; because what act soever\ncan be pretended by any one of them for breach thereof is the act both of himself, and of all the rest, because done in\nthe person, and by the right of every one of them in particular. Besides, if any one or more of them pretend a breach\nof the covenant made by the sovereign at his institution, and others or one other of his subjects, or himself alone,\npretend there was no such breach, there is in this case no judge to decide the controversy: it returns therefore to the\nsword again; and every man recovers the right of protecting himself by his own strength, contrary to the design they\nhad in the institution. It is therefore in vain to grant sovereignty by way of precedent covenant. The opinion that any\nmonarch receives his power by covenant, that is to say, on condition, proceeds from want of understanding this easy\ntruth: that covenants being but words, and breath, have no force to oblige, contain, constrain, or protect any man, but\nwhat it has from the public sword; that is, from the untied hands of that man, or assembly of men, that hath the\nsovereignty, and whose actions are avouched by them all, and performed by the strength of them all, in him united.\nBut when an assembly of men is made sovereign, then no man imagines any such covenant to have passed in the\ninstitution: for no man is so dull as to say, for example, the people of Rome made a covenant with the Romans to\nhold the sovereignty on such or such conditions; which not performed, the Romans might lawfully depose the\nRoman people. That men see not the reason to be alike in a monarchy and in a popular government proceeds from\nthe ambition of some that are kinder to the government of an assembly, whereof they may hope to participate, than\nof monarchy, which they despair to enjoy.\nThirdly, because the major part hath by consenting voices declared a sovereign, he that dissented must now consent\nwith the rest; that is, be contented to avow all the actions he shall do, or else justly be destroyed by the rest. For if he\nvoluntarily entered into the congregation of them that were assembled, he sufficiently declared thereby his will, and\ntherefore tacitly covenanted, to stand to what the major part should ordain: and therefore if he refuse to stand\nthereto, or make protestation against any of their decrees, he does contrary to his covenant, and therefore unjustly.\nAnd whether he be of the congregation or not, and whether his consent be asked or not, he must either submit to\ntheir decrees or be left in the condition of war he was in before; wherein he might without injustice be destroyed by\n\nany man whatsoever.\nFourthly, because every subject is by this institution author of all the actions and judgements of the sovereign\ninstituted, it follows that whatsoever he doth, can be no injury to any of his subjects; nor ought he to be by any of\nthem accused of injustice. For he that doth anything by authority from another doth therein no injury to him by\nwhose authority he acts: but by this institution of a Commonwealth every particular man is author of all the\nsovereign doth; and consequently he that complains of injury from his sovereign complains of that whereof he\nhimself is author, and therefore ought not to accuse any man but himself; no, nor himself of injury, because to do\ninjury to oneself is impossible. It is true that they that have sovereign power may commit iniquity, but not injustice\nor injury in the proper signification.\nFifthly, and consequently to that which was said last, no man that hath sovereign power can justly be put to death, or\notherwise in any manner by his subjects punished. For seeing every subject is author of the actions of his sovereign,\nhe punishes another for the actions committed by himself. . . .\nSixthly, it is annexed to the sovereignty to be judge of what opinions and doctrines are averse, and what conducing\nto peace; and consequently, on what occasions, how far, and what men are to be trusted withal in speaking to\nmultitudes of people; and who shall examine the doctrines of all books before they be published. For the actions of\nmen proceed from their opinions, and in the well governing of opinions consists the well governing of men's actions\nin order to their peace and concord. And though in matter of doctrine nothing to be regarded but the truth, yet this is\nnot repugnant to regulating of the same by peace. For doctrine repugnant to peace can no more be true, than peace\nand concord can be against the law of nature. . . .\n\nThese are the rights which make the essence of sovereignty, and which are the marks whereby a man may\ndiscern in what man, or assembly of men, the sovereign power is placed and resides. For these are\nincommunicable and inseparable. . . .And because they are essential and inseparable rights, it follows\nnecessarily that in whatsoever words any of them seem to be granted away, yet if the sovereign power itself\nbe not in direct terms renounced and the name of sovereign no more given by the grantees to him that\ngrants them, the grant is void: for when he has granted all he can, if we grant back the sovereignty, all is\nrestored, as inseparably annexed thereunto. . . .\nBut a man may here object that the condition of subjects is very miserable, as being obnoxious to the lusts\nand other irregular passions of him or them that have so unlimited a power in their hands. And commonly\nthey that live under a monarch think it the fault of monarchy; and they that live under the government of\ndemocracy, or other sovereign assembly, attribute all the inconvenience to that form of Commonwealth;\nwhereas the power in all forms, if they be perfect enough to protect them, is the same: not considering that\nthe estate of man can never be without some incommodity or other; and that the greatest that in any form of\ngovernment can possibly happen to the people in general is scarce sensible, in respect of the miseries and\nhorrible calamities that accompany a civil war, or that dissolute condition of masterless men without\nsubjection to laws and a coercive power to tie their hands from rapine and revenge . . . For all men are by\nnature provided of notable multiplying glasses (that is their passions and self-love) through which every\nlittle payment appears prospective glasses (namely moral and civil science) to see afar off the miseries that\nhang over them and cannot without such payments be avoided.\nCHAPTER XXI\nOF THE LIBERTY OF SUBJECTS\nLIBERTY, or freedom, signifies properly the absence of opposition (by opposition, I mean external\nimpediments of motion); and may be applied no less to irrational and inanimate creatures than to rational.\nFor whatsoever is so tied, or environed, as it cannot move but within a certain space, which space is\ndetermined by the opposition of some external body, we say it hath not liberty to go further. And so of all\nliving creatures, whilst they are imprisoned, or restrained with walls or chains; and of the water whilst it is\nkept in by banks or vessels that otherwise would spread itself into a larger space . . . But when the words\nfree and liberty are applied to anything but bodies, they are abused; for that which is not subject to motion\nis not to subject to impediment: and therefore . . . from the use of the words free will, no liberty can be\ninferred of the will, desire, or inclination, but the liberty of the man; which consists in this, that he finds no\nstop in doing what he has the will, desire, or inclination to do.\nFear and liberty are consistent: as when a man throws his goods into the sea for fear the ship should sink,\nhe doth it nevertheless very willingly, and may refuse to do it if he will; it is therefore the action of one that\nwas free: so a man sometimes pays his debt, only for fear of imprisonment, which, because no body\nhindered him from detaining, was the action of a man at liberty. And generally all actions which men do in\nCommonwealths, for fear of the law, are actions which the doers had liberty to omit.\nLiberty and necessity are consistent: as in the water that hath not only liberty, but a necessity of descending\nby the channel; so, likewise in the actions which men voluntarily do, which, because they proceed their\nwill, proceed from liberty, and yet because every act of man's will and every desire and inclination\nproceeds from some cause, and that from another cause, in a continual chain (whose first link is in the hand\nof God, the first of all causes), proceed from necessity. So that to him that could see the connection of those\ncauses, the necessity of all men's voluntary actions would appear manifest. And therefore God, that sees\nand disposes all things, sees also that the liberty of man in doing what he will is accompanied with the\nnecessity of doing that which God will and no more, nor less. For though men may do many things which\nGod does not command, nor is therefore author of them; yet they can have no passion, nor appetite to\nanything, of which appetite God's will is not the cause. And did not His will assure the necessity of man's\nwill, and consequently of all that on man's will depends, the liberty of men would be a contradiction and\nimpediment to the omnipotence and liberty of God. And this shall suffice, as to the matter in hand, of that\nural liberty, which only is properly called liberty."

Text: Original translation available on the Web, presumably in the public domain. Adapted and\nexcerpted by A.C. Kibel\nJean Jacques Rousseau (1712B1778). On the Inequality among Mankind.\n(Reply to a topic set by the Academy of Dijon in 1751: A What is the Origin of Inequality among Mankind\nAnd is it justified by Natural Law?@)\n(Translated by G.D.H. Cole. Excerpted and adapted by A.C. Kibel)\nPREFACE\nOF all human sciences the most useful and most imperfect appears to\nme to be that of mankind: and I will venture to say, the single inscription on\nthe Temple of Delphi contained a precept more difficult and more important\nthan is to be found in all the huge volumes that moralists have ever written. I\nconsider the subject of the following discourse as one of the most interesting\nquestions philosophy can propose, and unhappily for us, one of the most\nthorny that philosophers can have to solve. For how shall we know the source\nof inequality between men, if we do not begin by knowing mankind? And\nhow shall man hope to see himself as nature made him, across all the changes\nwhich the succession of place and time must have produced in his original\nconstitution? How can he distinguish what is fundamental in his nature from\nthe changes and additions which his circumstances and the advances he has\nmade have introduced to modify his primitive condition? Like the statue of\nGlaucus, which was so disfigured by time, seas and tempests, that it looked\nmore like a wild beast than a god, the human soul, altered in society by a\nthousand causes perpetually recurring, by the acquisition of a multitude of\ntruths and errors, by the changes happening to the constitution of the body,\nand by the continual jarring of the passions, has, so to speak, changed in\nappearance, so as to be hardly recognisable. Instead of a being, acting\nconstantly from fixed and invariable principles, instead of that celestial and\nmajestic simplicity, impressed on it by its divine Author, we find in it only\n\nthe frightful contrast of passion mistaking itself for reason, and of\nunderstanding grown delirious.\nIt is still more cruel that, as every advance made by the human species\nremoves it still farther from its primitive state, the more discoveries we make,\nthe more we deprive ourselves of the means of making the most important of\nall. Thus it is, in one sense, by our very study of man, that the knowledge of\nhim is put out of our power.\nIt is easy to perceive that it is in these successive changes in the\nconstitution of man that we must look for the origin of those differences\nwhich now distinguish men, who, it is allowed, are as equal among\nthemselves as were the animals of every kind, before physical causes had\nintroduced those varieties which are now observable among some of them.\nIt is, in fact, not to be conceived that these primary changes, however\nthey may have arisen, could have altered, all at once and in the same manner,\nevery individual of the species. It is natural to think that, while the condition\nof some of them grew better or worse, and they were acquiring various good\nor bad qualities not inherent in their nature, there were others who continued\na longer time in their original condition. Such was doubtless the first source\nof the inequality of mankind, which it is much easier to point out thus in\ngeneral terms, than to assign with precision to its actual causes.\nLet not my readers therefore imagine that I flatter myself with having\nseen what it appears to me so difficult to discover. I have here entered upon\ncertain arguments, and risked some conjectures, less in the hope of solving\nthe difficulty, than with a view to throwing some light upon it, and reducing\nthe question to its proper form. Others may easily proceed farther on the\nsame road, and yet no one find it very easy to get to the end. For it is by no\nmeans a light undertaking to distinguish properly between what is original\nand what is artificial in the actual nature of man, or to form a true idea of a\nstate which no longer exists, perhaps never did exist, and probably never will\nexist; and of which, it is, nevertheless, necessary to have true ideas, in order\nto form a proper judgment of our present state. It requires, indeed, more\nphilosophy than can be imagined to enable any one to determine exactly what\nprecautions he ought to take, in order to make solid observations on this\nsubject; and it appears to me that a good solution of the following problem\n\nwould be not unworthy of the Aristotles and Plinys of the present age. What\nexperiments would have to be made, to discover the natural man? And how\nare those experiments to be made in a state of society?\nSo far am I from undertaking to solve this problem, that I think I have\nsufficiently considered the subject, to venture to declare beforehand that our\ngreatest philosophers would not be too good to direct such experiments, and\nour most powerful sovereigns to make them. Such a combination we have\nvery little reason to expect, especially attended with the perseverance, or\nrather succession of intelligence and goodwill necessary on both sides to\nsuccess.\nThese investigations, which are so difficult to make, and have been\nhitherto so little thought of, are, nevertheless, the only means that remain of\nobviating a multitude of difficulties which deprive us of the knowledge of the\nreal foundations of human society. It is this ignorance of the nature of man,\nwhich casts so much uncertainty and obscurity on the true definition of\nnatural right: for, the idea of right, says Burlamaqui, and more particularly\nthat of natural right, are ideas manifestly relative to the nature of man. It is\nthen from this very nature itself, he goes on, from the constitution and state of\nman, that we must deduce the first principles of this science.\nWe cannot see without surprise and disgust how little agreement there\nis between the different authors who have treated this great subject. Among\nthe more important writers there are scarcely two of the same mind about it.\nNot to speak of the ancient philosophers, who seem to have done their best\npurposely to contradict one another on the most fundamental principles, the\nRoman jurists subjected man and the other animals indiscriminately to the\nsame natural law, because they considered, under that name, rather the law\nwhich nature imposes on herself than that which she prescribes to others; or\nrather because of the particular acceptation of the term law among those\njurists; who seem on this occasion to have understood nothing more by it than\nthe general relations established by nature between all animated beings, for\ntheir common preservation. The moderns, understanding, by the term law,\nmerely a rule prescribed to a moral being, that is to say intelligent, free and\nconsidered in his relations to other beings, consequently confine the\njurisdiction of natural law to man, as the only animal endowed with reason.\n\nBut, defining this law, each after his own fashion, they have established it on\nsuch metaphysical principles, that there are very few persons among us\ncapable of comprehending them, much less of discovering them for\nthemselves. So that the definitions of these learned men, all differing in\neverything else, agree only in this, that it is impossible to comprehend the law\nof nature, and consequently to obey it, without being a very subtle casuist and\na profound metaphysician. All which is as much as to say that mankind must\nhave employed, in the establishment of society, a capacity which is acquired\nonly with great difficulty, and by very few persons, even in a state of society.\nKnowing so little of nature, and agreeing so ill about the meaning of\nthe word law, it would be difficult for us to fix on a good definition of natural\nlaw. Thus all the definitions we meet with in books, setting aside their defect\nin point of uniformity, have yet another fault, in that they are derived from\nmany kinds of knowledge, which men do not possess naturally, and from\nadvantages of which they can have no idea until they have already departed\nfrom that state. Modern writers begin by inquiring what rules it would be\nexpedient for men to agree on for their common interest, and then give the\nname of natural law to a collection of these rules, without any other proof\nthan the good that would result from their being universally practised. This is\nundoubtedly a simple way of making definitions, and of explaining the nature\nof things by almost arbitrary conveniences.\nBut as long as we are ignorant of the natural man, it is in vain for us to\nattempt to determine either the law originally prescribed to him, or that which\nis best adapted to his constitution. All we can know with any certainty\nrespecting this law is that, if it is to be a law, not only the wills of those it\nobliges must be sensible of their submission to it; but also, to be natural, it\nmust come directly from the voice of nature.\nThrowing aside, therefore, all those scientific books, which teach us\nonly to see men such as they have made themselves, and contemplating the\nfirst and most simple operations of the human soul, I think I can perceive in it\ntwo principles prior to reason, one of them deeply interesting us in our own\nwelfare and preservation, and the other exciting a natural repugnance at\nseeing any other sensible being, and particularly any of our own species,\nsuffer pain or death. It is from the agreement and combination which the\n\nunderstanding is in a position to establish between these two principles,\nwithout its being necessary to introduce that of sociability, that all the rules of\nnatural right appear to me to be derived C rules which our reason is\nafterwards obliged to establish on other foundations, when by its successive\ndevelopments it has been led to suppress nature itself.\nIn proceeding thus, we shall not be obliged to make man a philosopher\nbefore he is a man. His duties toward others are not dictated to him only by\nthe later lessons of wisdom; and, so long as he does not resist the internal\nimpulse of compassion, he will never hurt any other man, nor even any\nsentient being, except on those lawful occasions on which his own\npreservation is concerned and he is obliged to give himself the preference. By\nthis method also we put an end to the time-honoured disputes concerning the\nparticipation of animals in natural law: for it is clear that, being destitute of\nintelligence and liberty, they cannot recognise that law; as they partake,\nhowever, in some measure of our nature, in consequence of the sensibility\nwith which they are endowed, they ought to partake of natural right; so that\nmankind is subjected to a kind of obligation even toward the brutes. It\nappears, in fact, that if I am bound to do no injury to my fellow-creatures, this\nis less because they are rational than because they are sentient beings: and\nthis quality, being common both to men and beasts, ought to entitle the latter\nat least to the privilege of not being wantonly ill-treated by the former.\nThe very study of the original man, of his real wants, and the\nfundamental principles of his duty, is besides the only proper method we can\nadopt to obviate all the difficulties which the origin of moral inequality\npresents, on the true foundations of the body politic, on the reciprocal rights\nof its members, and on many other similar topics equally important and\nobscure.\nIf we look at human society with a calm and disinterested eye, it seems,\nat first, to show us only the violence of the powerful and the oppression of\nthe weak. The mind is shocked at the cruelty of the one, or is induced to\nlament the blindness of the other; and as nothing is less permanent in life than\nthose external relations, which are more frequently produced by accident than\nwisdom, and which are called weakness or power, riches or poverty, all\nhuman institutions seem at first glance to be founded merely on banks of\nshifting sand. It is only by taking a closer look, and removing the dust and\n\nsand that surround the edifice, that we perceive the immovable basis on\nwhich it is raised, and learn to respect its foundations. Now, without a serious\nstudy of man, his natural faculties and their successive development, we shall\nnever be able to make these necessary distinctions, or to separate, in the\nactual constitution of things, that which is the effect of the divine will, from\nthe innovations attempted by human art. The political and moral\ninvestigations, therefore, to which the important question before us leads, are\nin every respect useful; while the hypothetical history of governments affords\na lesson equally instructive to mankind.\nIn considering what we should have become, had we been left to\nourselves, we should learn to bless Him, whose gracious hand, correcting our\ninstitutions, and giving them an immovable basis, has prevented those\ndisorders which would otherwise have arisen from them, and caused our\n8happiness to come from those very sources which seemed likely to involve\nus in misery.\nA DISSERTATION ON THE ORIGIN AND FOUNDATION OF\nTHE INEQUALITY OF MANKIND\nINTRODUCTION\nIT is of man that I have to speak; and the question I am investigating shows me that it is to men\nthat I must address myself: for questions of this sort are not asked by those who are afraid to honour truth.\nI shall then confidently uphold the cause of humanity before the wise men who invite me to do so, and\nshall not be dissatisfied if I acquit myself in a manner worthy of my subject and of my judges.\nI conceive that there are two kinds of inequality among the human species; one, which I call\nnatural or physical, because it is established by nature, and consists in a difference of age, health, bodily\nstrength, and the qualities of the mind or of the soul: and another, which may be called moral or political\ninequality, because it depends on a kind of convention, and is established, or at least authorised by the\nconsent of men. This latter consists of the different privileges, which some men enjoy to the prejudice of\nothers; such as that of being more rich, more honoured, more powerful or even in a position to exact\nobedience.\nIt is useless to ask what is the source of natural inequality, because that question is answered by\nthe simple definition of the word. Again, it is still more useless to inquire whether there is any essential\nconnection between the two inequalities; for this would be only asking, in other words, whether those\nwho command are necessarily better than those who obey, and if strength of body or of mind, wisdom or\nvirtue are always found in particular individuals, in proportion to their power or wealth: a question fit\nperhaps to be discussed by slaves in the hearing of their masters, but highly unbecoming to reasonable\nand free men in search of the truth.\n\nThe subject of the present discourse, therefore, is more precisely this. To mark, in the progress of\nthings, the moment at which right took the place of violence and nature became subject to law, and to\nexplain by what sequence of miracles the strong came to submit to serve the weak, and the people to\npurchase imaginary repose at the expense of real felicity.\nThe philosophers, who have inquired into the foundations of society, have all felt the necessity of\ngoing back to a state of nature; but not one of them has got there. Some of them have not hesitated to\nascribe to man, in such a state, the idea of just and unjust, without troubling themselves to show that he\nmust be possessed of such an idea, or that it could be of any use to him. Others have spoken of the natural\nright of every man to keep what belongs to him, without explaining what they meant by belongs. Others\nagain, beginning by giving the strong authority over the weak, proceeded directly to the birth of\ngovernment, without regard to the time that must have elapsed before the meaning of the words authority\nand government could have existed among men. Every one of them, in short, constantly dwelling on\nwants, avidity, oppression, desires and pride, has transferred to the state of nature ideas which were\nacquired in society; so that, in speaking of the savage, they described the social man. It has not even\nentered into the heads of most of our writers to doubt whether the state of nature ever existed; but it is\nclear from the Holy Scriptures that the first man, having received his understanding and commandments\nimmediately from God, was not himself in such a state; and that, if we give such credit to the writings of\nMoses as every Christian philosopher ought to give, we must deny that, even before the deluge, men were\never in the pure state of nature; unless, indeed, they fell back into it from some very extraordinary\ncircumstance; a paradox which it would be very embarrassing to defend, and quite impossible to prove.\nLet us begin then by laying facts aside, as they do not affect the question. The investigations we\nmay enter into, in treating this subject, must not be considered as historical truths, but only as mere\nconditional and hypothetical reasonings, rather calculated to explain the nature of things, than to ascertain\ntheir actual origin; just like the hypotheses which our physicists daily form respecting the formation of the\nworld. Religion commands us to believe that, God Himself having taken men out of a state of nature\nimmediately after the creation, they are unequal only because it is His will they should be so: but it does\nnot forbid us to form conjectures based solely on the nature of man, and the beings around him,\nconcerning what might have become of the human race, if it had been left to itself. This then is the\nquestion asked me, and that which I propose to discuss in the following discourse. As my subject interests\nmankind in general, I shall endeavour to make use of a style adapted to all nations, or rather, forgetting\ntime and place, to attend only to men to whom I am speaking. I shall suppose myself in the Lyceum of\nAthens, repeating the lessons of my masters, with Plato and Xenocrates for judges, and the whole human\nrace for audience.\nO man, of whatever country you are, and whatever your opinions may be, behold your history,\nsuch as I have thought to read it, not in books written by your fellow-creatures, who are liars, but in\nnature, which never lies. All that comes from her will be true; nor will you meet with anything false,\nunless I have involuntarily put in something of my own. The times of which I am going to speak are very\nremote: how much are you changed from what you once were! It is, so to speak, the life of your species\nwhich I am going to write, after the qualities which you have received, which your education and habits\nmay have depraved, but cannot have entirely destroyed. There is, I feel, an age at which the individual\nman would wish to stop: you are about to inquire about the age at which you would have liked your\nwhole species to stand still. Discontented with your present state, for reasons which threaten your\nunfortunate descendants with still greater discontent, you will perhaps wish it were in your power to go\nback; and this feeling should be a panegyric on your first ancestors, a criticism of your contemporaries,\nand a terror to the unfortunates who will come after you.\nTHE FIRST PART\n\nIMPORTANT as it may be, in order to judge rightly of the natural state of man, to consider him\nfrom his origin, and to examine him, as it were, in the embryo of his species; I shall not follow his\norganisation through its successive developments, nor shall I stay to inquire what his animal system must\nhave been at the beginning, in order to become at length what it actually is. I shall not ask whether his\nlong nails were at first, as Aristotle supposes, only crooked talons; whether his whole body, like that of a\nbear, was not covered with hair; or whether the fact that he walked upon all fours, with his looks directed\ntoward the earth, confined to a horizon of a few paces, did not at once point out the nature and limits of\nhis ideas. On this subject I could form none but vague and almost imaginary conjectures. Comparative\nanatomy has as yet made too little progress, and the observations of naturalists are too uncertain to afford\nan adequate basis for any solid reasoning. So that, without having recourse to the supernatural\ninformation given us on this head, or paying any regard to the changes which must have taken place in the\ninternal, as well as the external, conformation of man, as he applied his limbs to new uses, and fed\nhimself on new kinds of food, I shall suppose his conformation to have been at all times what it appears to\nus at this day; that he always walked on two legs, made use of his hands as we do, directed his looks over\nall nature, and measured with his eyes the vast expanse of Heaven.\nIf we strip this being, thus constituted, of all the supernatural gifts he may have received, and all\nthe artificial faculties he can have acquired only by a long process; if we consider him, in a word, just as\nhe must have come from the hands of nature, we behold in him an animal weaker than some, and less\nagile than others; but, taking him all round, the most advantageously organised of any. I see him\nsatisfying his hunger at the first oak, and slaking his thirst at the first brook; finding his bed at the foot of\nthe tree which afforded him a repast; and, with that, all his wants supplied.\nWhile the earth was left to its natural fertility and covered with immense forests, whose trees\nwere never mutilated by the axe, it would present on every side both sustenance and shelter for every\nspecies of animal. Men, dispersed up and down among the rest, would observe and imitate their industry,\nand thus attain even to the instinct of the beasts, with the advantage that, whereas every species of brutes\nwas confined to one particular instinct, man, who perhaps has not any one peculiar to himself, would\nappropriate them all, and live upon most of those different foods which other animals shared among\nthemselves; and thus would find his subsistence much more easily than any of the rest.\nAccustomed from their infancy to the inclemencies of the weather and the rigour of the seasons,\ninured to fatigue, and forced, naked and unarmed, to defend themselves and their prey from other\nferocious animals, or to escape them by flight, men would acquire a robust and almost unalterable\nconstitution. The children, bringing with them into the world the excellent constitution of their parents,\nand fortifying it by the very exercises which first produced it, would thus acquire all the vigour of which\nthe human frame is capable. Nature in this case treats them exactly as Sparta treated the children of her\ncitizens: those who come well formed into the world she renders strong and robust, and all the rest she\ndestroys; differing in this respect from our modern communities, in which the State, by making children a\nburden to their parents, kills them indiscriminately before they are born.\nThe body of a savage man being the only instrument he understands, he uses it for various\npurposes, of which ours, for want of practice, are incapable: for our industry deprives us of that force and\nagility, which necessity obliges him to acquire. If he had had an axe, would he have been able with his\nnaked arm to break so large a branch from a tree? If he had had a sling, would he have been able to throw\na stone with so great velocity? If he had had a ladder, would he have been so nimble in climbing a tree? If\nhe had had a horse, would he have been himself so swift of foot? Give civilised man time to gather all his\nmachines about him, and he will no doubt easily beat the savage; but if you would see a still more\nunequal contest, set them together naked and unarmed, and you will soon see the advantage of having all\nour forces constantly at our disposal, of being always prepared for every event, and of carrying one's self,\n\nas it were, perpetually whole and entire about one.\nHobbes contends that man is naturally intrepid, and is intent only upon attacking and fighting.\nAnother illustrious philosopher holds the opposite, and Cumberland and Puffendorf also affirm that\nnothing is more timid and fearful than man in the state of nature; that he is always in a tremble, and ready\nto fly at the least noise or the slightest movement. This may be true of things he does not know; and I do\nnot doubt his being terrified by every novelty that presents itself, when he neither knows the physical\ngood or evil he may expect from it, nor can make a comparison between his own strength and the dangers\nhe is about to encounter. Such circumstances, however, rarely occur in a state of nature, in which all\nthings proceed in a uniform manner, and the face of the earth is not subject to those sudden and continual\nchanges which arise from the passions and caprices of bodies of men living together. But savage man,\nliving dispersed among other animals, and finding himself betimes in a situation to measure his strength\nwith theirs, soon comes to compare himself with them; and, perceiving that he surpasses them more in\nadroitness than they surpass him in strength, learns to be no longer afraid of them. Set a bear, or a wolf,\nagainst a robust, agile, and resolute savage, as they all are, armed with stones and a good cudgel, and you\nwill see that the danger will be at least on both sides, and that, after a few trials of this kind, wild beasts,\nwhich are not fond of attacking each other, will not be at all ready to attack man, whom they will have\nfound to be as wild and ferocious as themselves. With regard to such animals as have really more strength\nthan man has adroitness, he is in the same situation as all weaker animals, which notwithstanding are still\nable to subsist; except indeed that he has the advantage that, being equally swift of foot, and finding an\nalmost certain place of refuge in every tree, he is at liberty to take or leave it at every encounter, and thus\nto fight or fly, as he chooses. Add to this that it does not appear that any animal naturally makes war on\nman, except in case of self-defence or excessive hunger, or betrays any of those violent antipathies, which\nseem to indicate that one species is intended by nature for the food of another.\nThis is doubtless why negroes and savages are so little afraid of the wild beasts they may meet in\nthe woods. The Caraibs of Venezuela among others live in this respect in absolute security and without\nthe smallest inconvenience. Though they are almost naked, Francis Correal tells us, they expose\nthemselves freely in the woods, armed only with bows and arrows; but no one has ever heard of one of\nthem being devoured by wild beasts.\nBut man has other enemies more formidable, against which is is not provided with such means of\ndefence: these are the natural infirmities of infancy, old age, and illness of every kind, melancholy proofs\nof our weakness, of which the two first are common to all animals, and the last belongs chiefly to man in\na state of society. With regard to infancy, it is observable that the mother, carrying her child always with\nher, can nurse it with much greater ease than the females of many other animals, which are forced to be\nperpetually going and coming, with great fatigue, one way to find subsistence, and another to suckle or\nfeed their young. It is true that if the woman happens to perish, the infant is in great danger of perishing\nwith her; but this risk is common to many other species of animals, whose young take a long time before\nthey are able to provide for themselves. And if our infancy is longer than theirs, our lives are longer in\nproportion; so that all things are in this respect fairly equal; though there are other rules to be considered\nregarding the duration of the first period of life, and the number of young, which do not affect the present\nsubject. In old age, when men are less active and perspire little, the need for food diminishes with the\nability to provide it. As the savage state also protects them from gout and rheumatism, and old age is, of\nall ills, that which human aid can least alleviate, they cease to be, without others perceiving that they are\nno more, and almost without perceiving it themselves.\nWith respect to sickness, I shall not repeat the vain and false declamations which most healthy\npeople pronounce against medicine; but I shall ask if any solid observations have been made from which\nit may be justly concluded that, in the countries where the art of medicine is most neglected, the mean\nduration of man's life is less than in those where it is most cultivated. How indeed can this be the case, if\n\nwe bring on ourselves more diseases than medicine can furnish remedies? The great inequality in manner\nof living, the extreme idleness of some, and the excessive labour of others, the easiness of exciting and\ngratifying our sensual appetites, the too exquisite foods of the wealthy which overheat and fill them with\nindigestion, and, on the other hand, the unwholesome food of the poor, often, bad as it is, insufficient for\ntheir needs, which induces them, when opportunity offers, to eat voraciously and overcharge their\nstomachs; all these, together with sitting up late, and excesses of every kind, immoderate transports of\nevery passion, fatigue, mental exhaustion, the innumerable pains and anxieties inseparable from every\ncondition of life, by which the mind of man is incessantly tormented; these are too fatal proofs that the\ngreater part of our ills are of our own making, and that we might have avoided them nearly all by\nadhering to that simple, uniform and solitary manner of life which nature prescribed. If she destined man\nto be healthy, I venture to declare that a state of reflection is a state contrary to nature, and that a thinking\nman is a depraved animal. When we think of the good constitution of the savages, at least of those whom\nwe have not ruined with our spirituous liquors, and reflect that they are troubled with hardly any\ndisorders, save wounds and old age, we are tempted to believe that, in following the history of civil\nsociety, we shall be telling also that of human sickness. Such, at least, was the opinion of Plato, who\ninferred from certain remedies prescribed, or approved, by Podalirius and Machaon at the siege of Troy,\nthat several sicknesses which these remedies gave rise to in his time, were not then known to mankind:\nand Celsus tells us that diet, which is now so necessary, was first invented by Hippocrates.\nBeing subject therefore to so few causes of sickness, man, in the state of nature, can have no need\nof remedies, and still less of physicians: nor is the human race in this respect worse off than other\nanimals, and it is easy to learn from hunters whether they meet with many infirm animals in the course of\nthe chase. It is certain they frequently meet with such as carry the marks of having been considerably\nwounded, with many that have had bones or even limbs broken, yet have been healed without any other\nsurgical assistance than that of time, or any other regimen than that of their ordinary life. At the same time\ntheir cures seem not to have been less perfect, for their not having been tortured by incisions, poisoned\nwith drugs, or wasted by fasting. In short, however useful medicine, properly administered, may be\namong us, it is certain that, if the savage, when he is sick and left to himself, has nothing to hope but from\nnature, he has, on the other hand, nothing to fear but from his disease; which renders his situation often\npreferable to our own.\nWe should beware, therefore, of confounding the savage man with the men we have daily before\nour eyes. Nature treats all the animals left to her care with a predilection that seems to show how jealous\nshe is of that right. The horse, the cat, the bull, and even the ass are generally of greater stature, and\nalways more robust, and have more vigour, strength and courage, when they run wild in the forests than\nwhen bred in the stall. By becoming domesticated, they lose half these advantages; and it seems as if all\nour care to feed and treat them well serves only to deprave them. It is thus with man also: as he becomes\nsociable and a slave, he grows weak, timid and servile; his effeminate way of life totally enervates his\nstrength and courage. To this it may be added that there is still a greater difference between savage and\ncivilised man, than between wild and tame beasts: for men and brutes having been treated alike by nature,\nthe several conveniences in which men indulge themselves still more than they do their beasts, are so\nmany additional causes of their deeper degeneracy.\nIt is not therefore so great a misfortune to these primitive men, nor so great an obstacle to their\npreservation, that they go naked, have no dwellings and lack all the superfluities which we think so\nnecessary. If their skins are not covered with hair, they have no need of such covering in warm climates;\nand, in cold countries, they soon learn to appropriate the skins of the beasts they have overcome. If they\nhave but two legs to run with, they have two arms to defend themselves with, and provide for their wants.\nTheir children are slowly and with difficulty taught to walk; but their mothers are able to carry them with\nease; an advantage which other animals lack, as the mother, if pursued, is forced either to abandon her\nyoung, or to regulate her pace by theirs. Unless, in short, we suppose a singular and fortuitous\n\nconcurrence of circumstances of which I shall speak later, and which would be unlikely to exist, it is plain\nin every state of the case, that the man who first made himself clothes or a dwelling was furnishing\nhimself with things not at all necessary; for he had till then done without them, and there is no reason why\nhe should not have been able to put up in manhood with the same kind of life as had been his in infancy.\nSolitary, indolent, and perpetually accompanied by danger, the savage cannot but be fond of\nsleep; his sleep too must be light, like that of the animals, which think but little and may be said to\nslumber all the time they do not think. Self-preservation being his chief and almost sole concern, he must\nexercise most those faculties which are most concerned with attack or defence, either for overcoming his\nprey, or for preventing him from becoming the prey of other animals. On the other hand, those organs\nwhich are perfected only by softness and sensuality will remain in a gross and imperfect state,\nincompatible with any sort of delicacy; so that, his senses being divided on this head, his touch and taste\nwill be extremely coarse, his sight, hearing and smell exceedingly fine and subtle. Such in general is the\nanimal condition, and such, according to the narratives of travellers, is that of most savage nations. It is\ntherefore no matter for surprise that the Hottentots of the Cape of Good Hope distinguish ships at sea,\nwith the naked eye, at as great a distance as the Dutch can do with their telescopes; or that the savages of\nAmerica should trace the Spaniards, by their smell, as well as the best dogs could have done; or that these\nbarbarous peoples feel no pain in going naked, or that they use large quantities of piemento with their\nfood, and drink the strongest European liquors like water.\nHitherto I have considered merely the physical man; let us now take a view of him on his\nmetaphysical and moral side.\nI see nothing in any animal but an ingenious machine, to which nature hath given senses to wind\nitself up, and to guard itself, to a certain degree, against anything that might tend to disorder or destroy it.\nI perceive exactly the same things in the human machine, with this difference, that in the operations of the\nbrute, nature is the sole agent, whereas man has some share in his own operations, in his character as a\nfree agent. The one chooses and refuses by instinct, the other from an act of free-will: hence the brute\ncannot deviate from the rule prescribed to it, even when it would be advantageous for it to do so; and, on\nthe contrary, man frequently deviates from such rules to his own prejudice. Thus a pigeon would be\nstarved to death by the side of a dish of the choicest meats, and a cat on a heap of fruit or grain; though it\nis certain that either might find nourishment in the foods which it thus rejects with disdain, did it think of\ntrying them. Hence it is that dissolute men run into excesses which bring on fevers and death; because the\nmind depraves the senses, and the will continues to speak when nature is silent.\nEvery animal has ideas, since it has senses; it even combines those ideas in a certain degree; and\nit is only in degree that man differs, in this respect, from the brute. Some philosophers have even\nmaintained that there is a greater difference between one man and another than between some men and\nsome beasts. It is not, therefore, so much the understanding that constitutes the specific difference\nbetween the man and the brute, as the human quality of free-agency. Nature lays her commands on every\nanimal, and the brute obeys her voice. Man receives the same impulsion, but at the same time knows\nhimself at liberty to acquiesce or resist: and it is particularly in his consciousness of this liberty that the\nspirituality of his soul is displayed. For physics may explain, in some measure, the mechanism of the\nsenses and the formation of ideas; but in the power of willing or rather of choosing, and in the feeling of\nthis power, nothing is to be found but acts which are purely spiritual and wholly inexplicable by the laws\nof mechanism.\nHowever, even if the difficulties attending all these questions should still leave room for\ndifference in this respect between men and brutes, there is another very specific quality which\ndistinguishes them, and which will admit of no dispute. This is the faculty of self-improvement, which, by\nthe help of circumstances, gradually develops all the rest of our faculties, and is inherent in the species as\n\nin the individual: whereas a brute is, at the end of a few months, all he will ever be during his whole life,\nand his species, at the end of a thousand years, exactly what it was the first year of that thousand. Why is\nman alone liable to grow into a dotard? Is it not because he returns, in this, to his primitive state; and that,\nwhile the brute, which has acquired nothing and has therefore nothing to lose, still retains the force of\ninstinct, man, who loses, by age or accident, all that his perfectibility had enabled him to gain, falls by this\nmeans lower than the brutes themselves? It would be melancholy, were we forced to admit that this\ndistinctive and almost unlimited faculty is the source of all human misfortunes; that it is this which, in\ntime, draws man out of his original state, in which he would have spent his days insensibly in peace and\ninnocence; that it is this faculty, which, successively producing in different ages his discoveries and his\nerrors, his vices and his virtues, makes him at length a tyrant both over himself and over nature.1 It would\nbe shocking to be obliged to regard as a benefactor the man who first suggested to the Oroonoko Indians\nthe use of the boards they apply to the temples of their children, which secure to them some part at least\nof their imbecility and original happiness.\nSavage man, left by nature solely to the direction of instinct, or rather indemnified for what he\nmay lack by faculties capable at first of supplying its place, and afterwards of raising him much above it,\nmust accordingly begin with purely animal functions: thus seeing and feeling must be his first condition,\nwhich would be common to him and all other animals. To will, and not to will, to desire and to fear, must\nbe the first, and almost the only operations of his soul, till new circumstances occasion new developments\nof his faculties.\nWhatever moralists may hold, the human understanding is greatly indebted to the passions,\nwhich, it is universally allowed, are also much indebted to the understanding. It is by the activity of the\npassions that our reason is improved; for we desire knowledge only because we wish to enjoy; and it is\nimpossible to conceive any reason why a person who has neither fears nor desires should give himself the\ntrouble of reasoning. The passions, again, originate in our wants, and their progress depends on that of our\nknowledge; for we cannot desire or fear anything, except from the idea we have of it, or from the simple\nimpulse of nature. Now savage man, being destitute of every species of intelligence, can have no passions\nsave those of the latter kind: his desires never go beyond his physical wants. The only goods he\nrecognises in the universe are food, a female, and sleep: the only evils he fears are pain and hunger. I say\npain, and not death: for no animal can know what it is to die; the knowledge of death and its terrors being\none of the first acquisitions made by man in departing from an animal state.\nIt would be easy, were it necessary, to support this opinion by facts, and to show that, in all the\nnations of the world, the progress of the understanding has been exactly proportionate to the wants which\nthe peoples had received from nature, or been subjected to by circumstances, and in consequence to the\npassions that induced them to provide for those necessities. I might instance the arts, rising up in Egypt\nand expanding with the inundation of the Nile. I might follow their progress into Greece, where they took\nroot afresh, grew up and lowered to the skies, among the rocks and sands of Attica, without being able to\ngerminate on the fertile banks of the Eurotas: I might observe that in general, the people of the North are\nmore industrious than those of the South, because they cannot get on so well without being so: as if nature\nwanted to equalise matters by giving their understandings the fertility she had refused to their soil.\nBut who does not see, without recurring to the uncertain testimony of history, that everything\nseems to remove from savage man both the temptation and the means of changing his condition? His\nimagination paints no pictures; his heart makes no demands on him. His few wants are so readily\nsupplied, and he is so far from having the knowledge which is needful to make him want more, that he\ncan have neither foresight nor curiosity. The face of nature becomes indifferent to him as it grows\nfamiliar. He sees in it always the same order, the same successions: he has not understanding enough to\n1See Appendix\n\nwonder at the greatest miracles; nor is it in his mind that we can expect to find that philosophy man needs,\nif he is to know how to notice for once what he sees every day. His soul, which nothing disturbs, is\nwholly wrapped up in the feeling of its present existence, without any idea of the future, however near at\nhand; while his projects, as limited as his views, hardly extend to the close of day. Such, even at present,\nis the extent of the native Caribbean's foresight: he will improvidently sell you his cotton-bed in the\nmorning, and come crying in the evening to buy it again, not having foreseen he would want it again the\nnext night.\nThe more we reflect on this subject, the greater appears the distance between pure sensation and\nthe most simple knowledge: it is impossible indeed to conceive how a man, by his own powers alone,\nwithout the aid of communication and the spur of necessity, could have bridged so great a gap. How many\nages may have elapsed before mankind were in a position to behold any other fire than that of the\nheavens. What a multiplicity of chances must have happened to teach them the commonest uses of that\nelement! How often must they have let it out before they acquired the art of reproducing it? and how often\nmay not such a secret have died with him who had discovered it? What shall we say of agriculture, an art\nwhich requires so much labour and foresight, which is so dependent on others that it is plain it could only\nbe practised in a society which had at least begun, and which does not serve so much to draw the means\nof subsistence from the earth C for these it would produce of itself C but to compel it to produce what is\nmost to our taste? But let us suppose that men had so multiplied that the natural produce of the earth was\nno longer sufficient for their support; a supposition, by the way, which would prove such a life to be very\nadvantageous for the human race; let us suppose that, without forges or workshops, the instruments of\nhusbandry had dropped from the sky into the hands of savages; that they had overcome their natural\naversion to continual labour; that they had learnt so much foresight for their needs; that they had divined\nhow to cultivate the earth, to sow grain and plant trees; that they had discovered the arts of grinding corn,\nand of setting the grape to ferment C all being things that must have been taught them by the gods, since it\nis not to be conceived how they could discover them for themselves C yet after all this, what man among\nthem would be so absurd as to take the trouble of cultivating a field, which might be stripped of its crop\nby the first comer, man or beast, that might take a liking to it; and how should each of them resolve to\npass his life in wearisome labour, when, the more necessary to him the reward of his labour might be, the\nsurer he would be of not getting it? In a word, how could such a situation induce men to cultivate the\nearth, till it was regularly parcelled out among them; that is to say, till the state of nature had been\nabolished?\nWere we to suppose savage man as trained in the art of thinking as philosophers make him; were\nwe, like them, to suppose him a very philosopher capable of investigating the sublimest truths, and of\nforming, by highly abstract chains of reasoning, maxims of reason and justice, deduced from the love of\norder in general, or the known will of his Creator; in a word, were we to suppose him as intelligent and\nenlightened, as he must have been, and is in fact found to have been, dull and stupid, what advantage\nwould accrue to the species, from all such metaphysics, which could not be communicated by one to\nanother, but must end with him who made them? What progress could be made by mankind, while\ndispersed in the woods among other animals? and how far could men improve or mutually enlighten one\nanother, when, having no fixed habitation, and no need of one another's assistance, the same persons\nhardly met twice in their lives, and perhaps then, without knowing one another or speaking together?\nLet it be considered how many ideas we owe to the use of speech; how far grammar exercises the\nunderstanding and facilitates its operations. Let us reflect on the inconceivable pains and the infinite space\nof time that the first invention of languages must have cost. To these reflections add what preceded, and\nthen judge how many thousand ages must have elapsed in the successive development in the human mind\nof those operations of which it is capable.\nI shall here take the liberty for a moment, of considering the difficulties of the origin of\n\nlanguages, on which subject I might content myself with a simple repetition of the Abbe Condillac's\ninvestigations, as they fully confirm my system, and perhaps even first suggested it. But it is plain, from\nthe manner in which this philosopher solves the difficulties he himself raises, concerning the origin of\narbitrary signs, that he assumes what I question, viz., that a kind of society must already have existed\namong the first inventors of language. While I refer, therefore, to his observations on this head, I think it\nright to give my own, in order to exhibit the same difficulties in a light adapted to my subject. The first\nwhich presents itself is to conceive how language can have become necessary; for as there was no\ncommunication among men and no need for any, we can neither conceive the necessity of this invention,\nnor the possibility of it, if it was not somehow indispensable. I might affirm, with many others, that\nlanguages arose in the domestic intercourse between parents and their children. But this expedient would\nnot obviate the difficulty, and would besides involve the blunder made by those who, in reasoning on the\nstate of nature, always import into it ideas gathered in a state of society. Thus they constantly consider\nfamilies as living together under one roof, and the individuals of each as observing among themselves a\nunion as intimate and permanent as that which exists among us, where so many common interests unite\nthem: whereas, in this primitive state, men had neither houses, nor huts, nor any kind of property\nwhatever; every one lived where he could, seldom for more than a single night; the sexes united without\ndesign, as accident, opportunity or inclination brought them together, nor had they any great need of\nwords to communicate their designs to each other; and they parted with the same indifference. The\nmother gave suck to her children at first for her own sake; and afterwards, when habit had made them\ndear, for theirs: but as soon as they were strong enough to go in search of their own food, they forsook her\nof their own accord; and, as they had hardly any other method of not losing one another than that of\nremaining continually within sight, they soon became quite incapable of recognising one another when\nthey happened to meet again. It is farther to be observed that the child, having all his wants to explain,\nand of course more to say to his mother than the mother could have to say to him, must have borne the\nbrunt of the task of invention, and the language he used would be of his own device, so that the number of\nlanguages would be equal to that of the individuals speaking them, and the variety would be increased by\nthe vagabond and roving life they led, which would not give time for any idiom to become constant. For\nto say that the mother dictated to her child the words he was to use in asking her for one thing or another,\nis an explanation of how languages already formed are taught, but by no means explains how languages\nwere originally formed.\nWe will suppose, however, that this first difficulty is obviated. Let us for a moment then take\nourselves as being on this side of the vast space which must lie between a pure state of nature and that in\nwhich languages had become necessary, and, admitting their necessity, let us inquire how they could first\nbe established. Here we have a new and worse difficulty to grapple with; for if men need speech to learn\nto think, they must have stood in much greater need of the art of thinking, to be able to invent that of\nspeaking. And though we might conceive how the articulate sounds of the voice came to be taken as the\nconventional interpreters of our ideas, it would still remain for us to inquire what could have been the\ninterpreters of this convention for those ideas, which, answering to no sensible objects, could not be\nindicated either by gesture or voice; so that we can hardly form any tolerable conjectures about the origin\nof this art of communicating our thoughts and establishing a correspondence between minds: an art so\nsublime, that far distant as it is from its origin, philosophers still behold it at such an immeasurable\ndistance from perfection, that there is none rash enough to affirm it will ever reach it, even though the\nrevolutions time necessarily produces were suspended in its favour, though prejudice should be banished\nfrom our academies or condemned to silence, and those learned societies should devote themselves\nuninterruptedly for whole ages to this thorny question.\nThe first language of mankind, the most universal and vivid, in a word the only language man\nneeded, before he had occasion to exert his eloquence to persuade assembled multitudes, was the simple\ncry of nature. But as this was excited only by a sort of instinct on urgent occasions, to implore assistance\nin case of danger, or relief in case of suffering, it could be of little use in the ordinary course of life, in\n\nwhich more moderate feelings prevail. When the ideas of men began to expand and multiply, and closer\ncommunication took place among them, they strove to invent more numerous signs and a more copious\nlanguage. They multiplied the inflections of the voice, and added gestures, which are in their own nature\nmore expressive, and depend less for their meaning on a prior determination. Visible and movable objects\nwere therefore expressed by gestures, and audible ones by imitative sounds: but, as hardly anything can\nbe indicated by gestures, except objects actually present or easily described, and visible actions; as they\nare not universally useful C for darkness or the interposition of a material object destroys their efficacy C\nand as besides they rather request than secure our attention; men at length bethought themselves of\nsubstituting for them the articulate sounds of the voice, which, without bearing the same relation to any\nparticular ideas, are better calculated to express them all, as conventional signs. Such an institution could\nonly be made by common consent, and must have been effected in a manner not very easy for men whose\ngross organs had not been accustomed to any such exercise. It is also in itself still more difficult to\nconceive, since such a common agreement must have had motives, and speech seems to have been highly\nnecessary to establish the use of it.\nIt is reasonable to suppose that the words first made use of by mankind had a much more\nextensive signification than those used in languages already formed, and that ignorant as they were of the\ndivision of discourse into its constituent parts, they at first gave every single word the sense of a whole\nproposition. When they began to distinguish subject and attribute, and noun and verb, which was itself no\ncommon effort of genius, substantives were first only so many proper names; the present infinitive was\nthe only tense of verbs; and the very idea of adjectives must have been developed with great difficulty; for\nevery adjective is an abstract idea, and abstractions are painful and unnatural operations.\nEvery object at first received a particular name without regard to genus or species, which these\nprimitive originators were not in a position to distinguish; every individual presented itself to their minds\nin isolation, as they are in the picture of nature. If one oak was called A, another was called B; for the\nprimitive idea of two things is that they are not the same, and it often takes a long time for what they have\nin common to be seen: so that, the narrower the limits of their knowledge of things, the more copious\ntheir dictionary must have been. The difficulty of using such a vocabulary could not be easily removed;\nfor, to arrange beings under common and generic denominations, it became necessary to know their\ndistinguishing properties: the need arose for observation and definition, that is to say, for natural history\nand metaphysics of a far more developed kind than men can at that time have possessed.\nAdd to this, that general ideas cannot be introduced into the mind without the assistance of words,\nnor can the understanding seize them except by means of propositions. This is one of the reasons why\nanimals cannot form such ideas, or ever acquire that capacity for self-improvement which depends on\nthem. When a monkey goes from one nut to another, are we to conceive that he entertains any general\nidea of that kind of fruit, and compares its archetype with the two individual nuts? Assuredly he does not;\nbut the sight of one of these nuts recalls to his memory the sensations which he received from the other,\nand his eyes, being modified after a certain manner, give information to the palate of the modification it is\nabout to receive. Every general idea is purely intellectual; if the imagination meddles with it ever so little,\nthe idea immediately becomes particular. If you endeavour to trace in your mind the image of a tree in\ngeneral, you never attain to your end. In spite of all you can do, you will have to see it as great or little,\nbare or leafy, light or dark, and were you capable of seeing nothing in it but what is common to all trees,\nit would no longer be like a tree at all. Purely abstract beings are perceivable in the same manner, or are\nonly conceivable by the help of language. The definition of a triangle alone gives you a true idea of it: the\nmoment you imagine a triangle in your mind, it is some particular triangle and not another, and you\ncannot avoid giving it sensible lines and a coloured area. In order to form general ideas, we must make\nuse of propositions and of language, for imagination ceases to operate as soon as understanding proceeds\nonly by the use of words. If then the first inventors of speech could give names only to ideas they already\nhad, it follows that the first substantives could be nothing more than proper names.\n\nBut when our new grammarians, by means of which I have no conception, began to extend their\nideas and generalise their terms, the ignorance of the inventors must have confined this method within\nvery narrow limits; and, as they had at first gone too far in multiplying the names of individuals, from\nignorance of their genus and species, they made afterwards too few of these, from not having considered\nbeings in all their specific differences. It would indeed have needed more knowledge and experience than\nthey could have, and more pains and inquiry than they would have bestowed, to carry these distinctions to\ntheir proper length. If, even to-day, we are continually discovering new species, which have hitherto\nescaped observation, let us reflect how many of them must have escaped men who judged things merely\nfrom their first appearance! It is superfluous to add that the primitive classes and the most general notions\nmust necessarily have escaped their notice also. How, for instance, could they have understood or thought\nof the words matter, spirit, substance, mode, figure, motion, when even our philosophers, who have so\nlong been making use of them, have themselves the greatest difficulty in understanding them; and when,\nthe ideas attached to them being purely metaphysical, there are no models of them to be found in nature?\nBut I stop at this point, and ask my judges to suspend their reading a while, to consider, after the\ninvention of physical substantives, which is the easiest part of language to invent, that there is still a great\nway to go, before the thoughts of men will have found perfect expression and constant form, such as\nwould answer the purposes of public speaking, and produce their effect on society. I beg of them to\nconsider how much time must have been spent, and how much knowledge needed, to find out numbers,\nabstract terms, aorists and all the tenses of verbs, particles, syntax, the method of connecting propositions,\nthe forms of reasoning, and all the logic of speech. For myself, I am so aghast at the increasing difficulties\nwhich present themselves, and so well convinced of the almost demonstrable impossibility that languages\nshould owe their original institution to merely human means, that I leave, to any one who will undertake\nit, the discussion of the difficult problem, which was most necessary, the existence of society to the\ninvention of language, or the invention of language to the establishment of society. But be the origin of\nlanguage and society what they may, it may be at least inferred, from the little care which nature has\ntaken to unite mankind by mutual wants, and to facilitate the use of speech, that she has contributed little\nto make them sociable, and has put little of her own into all they have done to create such bonds of union.\nIt is in fact impossible to conceive why, in a state of nature, one man should stand more in need of the\nassistance of another, than a monkey or a wolf of the assistance of another of its kind: or, granting that he\ndid, what motives could induce that other to assist him; or, even then, by what means they could agree\nabout the conditions. I know it is incessantly repeated that man would in such a state have been the most\nmiserable of creatures; and indeed, if it be true, as I think I have proved, that he must have lived many\nages, before he could have either desire or an opportunity of emerging from it, this would only be an\naccusation against nature, and not against the being which she had thus unhappily constituted. But as I\nunderstand the word miserable, it either has no meaning at all, or else signifies only a painful privation of\nsomething, or a state of suffering either in body or soul. I should be glad to have explained to me, what\nkind of misery a free being, whose heart is at ease and whose body is in health, can possibly suffer. I\nwould ask also, whether a social or a natural life is most likely to become insupportable to those who\nenjoy it. We see around us hardly a creature in civil society, who does not lament his existence: we even\nsee many deprive themselves of as much of it as they can, and laws human and divine together can hardly\nput a stop to the disorder. I ask, if it was ever known that a savage took it into his head, when at liberty, to\ncomplain of life or to make away with himself. Let us therefore judge, with less vanity, on which side the\nreal misery is found. On the other hand, nothing could be more unhappy than savage man, dazzled by\nscience, tormented by his passions, and reasoning about a state different from his own. It appears that\nProvidence most wisely determined that the faculties, which he potentially possessed, should develop\nthemselves only as occasion offered to exercise them, in order that they might not be superfluous or\nperplexing to him, by appearing before their time, nor slow and useless when the need for them arose. In\ninstinct alone, he had all he required for living in the state of nature; and with a developed understanding\nhe has only just enough to support life in society.\n\nIt appears, at first view, that men in a state of nature, having no moral relations or determinate\nobligations one with another, could not be either good or bad, virtuous or vicious; unless we take these\nterms in a physical sense, and call, in an individual, those qualities vices which may be injurious to his\npreservation, and those virtues which contribute to it; in which case, he would have to be accounted most\nvirtuous, who put least check on the pure impulses of nature. But without deviating from the ordinary\nsense of the words, it will be proper to suspend the judgment we might be led to form on such a state, and\nbe on our guard against our prejudices, till we have weighed the matter in the scales of impartiality, and\nseen whether virtues or vices preponderate among civilised men; and whether their virtues do them more\ngood than their vices do harm; till we have discovered, whether the progress of the sciences sufficiently\nindemnifies them for the mischiefs they do one another, in proportion as they are better informed of the\ngood they ought to do; or whether they would not be, on the whole, in a much happier condition if they\nhad nothing to fear or to hope from any one, than as they are, subjected to universal dependence, and\nobliged to take everything from those who engage to give them nothing in return.\nAbove all, let us not conclude, with Hobbes, that because man has no idea of goodness, he must\nbe naturally wicked; that he is vicious because he does not know virtue; that he always refuses to do his\nfellow-creatures services which he does not think they have a right to demand; or that by virtue of the\nright he truly claims to everything he needs, he foolishly imagines himself the sole proprietor of the whole\nuniverse. Hobbes had seen clearly the defects of all the modern definitions of natural right: but the\nconsequences which he deduces from his own show that he understands it in an equally false sense. In\nreasoning on the principles he lays down, he ought to have said that the state of nature, being that in\nwhich the care for our own preservation is the least prejudicial to that of others, was consequently the best\ncalculated to promote peace, and the most suitable for mankind. He does say the exact opposite, in\nconsequence of having improperly admitted, as a part of savage man's care for self-preservation, the\ngratification of a multitude of passions which are the work of society, and have made laws necessary. A\nbad man, he says, is a robust child. But it remains to be proved whether man in a state of nature is this\nrobust child: and, should we grant that he is, what would he infer? Why truly, that if this man, when\nrobust and strong, were dependent on others as he is when feeble, there is no extravagance he would not\nbe guilty of; that he would beat his mother when she was too slow in giving him her breast; that he would\nstrangle one of his younger brothers, if he should be troublesome to him, or bite the arm of another, if he\nput him to any inconvenience. But that man in the state of nature is both strong and dependent involves\ntwo contrary suppositions. Man is weak when he is dependent, and is his own master before he comes to\nbe strong. Hobbes did not reflect that the same cause, which prevents a savage from making use of his\nreason, as our jurists hold, prevents him also from abusing his faculties, as Hobbes himself allows: so that\nit may be justly said that savages are not bad merely because they do not know what it is to be good: for it\nis neither the development of the understanding nor the restraint of law that hinders them from doing ill;\nbut the peacefulness of their passions, and their ignorance of vice: tanto plus in illis proficit vitiorum\nignoratio, quam in his cognitio virtutis.2\n2Justin, Hist. ii. 2. So much more does the ignorance of vice profit the one sort than the\nknowledge of virtue the other.\n\nThere is another principle which has escaped Hobbes; which, having been bestowed on mankind,\nto moderate, on certain occasions, the impetuosity of egoism, or, before its birth, the desire of\nself-preservation, tempers the ardour with which he pursues his own welfare, by an innate repugnance at\nseeing a fellow-creature suffer.3 I think I need not fear contradiction in holding man to be possessed of the\nonly natural virtue, which could not be denied him by the most violent detractor of human virtue. I am\nspeaking of compassion, which is a disposition suitable to creatures so weak and subject to so many evils\nas we certainly are: by so much the more universal and useful to mankind, as it comes before any kind of\nreflection; and at the same time so natural, that the very brutes themselves sometimes give evident proofs\nof it. Not to mention the tenderness of mothers for their offspring and the perils they encounter to save\nthem from danger, it is well known that horses show a reluctance to trample on living bodies. One animal\nnever passes by the dead body of another of its species: there are even some which give their fellows a\nsort of burial; while the mournful lowings of the cattle when they enter the slaughter-house show the\nimpressions made on them by the horrible spectacle which meets them. We find, with pleasure, the author\nof the Fable of the Bees obliged to own that man is a compassionate and sensible being, and laying aside\nhis cold subtlety of style, in the example he gives, to present us with the pathetic description of a man\nwho, from a place of confinement, is compelled to behold a wild beast tear a child from the arms of its\nmother, grinding its tender limbs with its murderous teeth, and tearing its palpitating entrails with its\nclaws. What horrid agitation must not the eyewitness of such a scene experience, although he would not\nbe personally concerned! What anxiety would he not suffer at not being able to give any assistance to the\nfainting mother and the dying infant!\nSuch is the pure emotion of nature, prior to all kinds of reflection! Such is the force of natural\ncompassion, which the greatest depravity of morals has as yet hardly been able to destroy! for we daily\nfind at our theatres men affected, nay shedding tears at the sufferings of a wretch who, were he in the\ntyrant's place, would probably even add to the torments of his enemies; like the bloodthirsty Sulla, who\nwas so sensitive to ills he had not caused, or that Alexander of Pheros who did not dare to go and see any\ntragedy acted, for fear of being seen weeping with Andromache and Priam, though he could listen without\nemotion to the cries of all the citizens who were daily strangled at his command.\n3Egoism must not be confused with self-respect: for they differ both in themselves and in their\neffects. Self-respect is a natural feeling which leads every animal to look to its own preservation, and\nwhich, guided in man by reason and modified by compassion, creates humanity and virtue. Egoism is a\npurely relative and factitious feeling, which arises in the state of society, leads each individual to make\nmore of himself than of any other, causes all the mutual damage men inflict one on another, and is the real\nsource of the \"sense of honour.\" This being understood, I maintain that, in our primitive condition, in the\ntrue state of nature, egoism did not exist; for as each man regarded himself as the only observer of his\nactions, the only being in the universe who took any interest in him, and the sole judge of his deserts, no\nfeeling arising from comparisons he could not be led to make could take root in his soul; and for the same\nreason, he could know neither hatred nor the desire for revenge, since these passions can spring only from\na sense of injury: and as it is the contempt or the intention to hurt, and not the harm done, which\nconstitutes the injury, men who neither valued nor compared themselves could do one another much\nviolence, when it suited them, without feeling any sense of injury. In a word, each man, regarding his\nfellows almost as he regarded animals of different species, might seize the prey of a weaker or yield up\nhis own to a stronger, and yet consider these acts of violence as mere natural occurrences, without the\nslightest emotion of insolence or despite, or any other feeling than the joy or grief of success or failure.\n\nNature avows she gave the human race the softest hearts, who gave them tears.\nMandeville well knew that, in spite of all their morality, men would have never been better than\nmonsters, had not nature bestowed on them a sense of compassion, to aid their reason: but he did not see\nthat from this quality alone flow all those social virtues, of which he denied man the possession. But what\nis generosity, clemency or humanity but compassion applied to the weak, to the guilty, or to mankind in\ngeneral? Even benevolence and friendship are, if we judge rightly, only the effects of compassion,\nconstantly set upon a particular object: for how is it different to wish that another person may not suffer\npain and uneasiness and to wish him happy? Were it even true that pity is no more than a feeling, which\nputs us in the place of the sufferer, a feeling, obscure yet lively in a savage, developed yet feeble in\ncivilised man; this truth would have no other consequence than to confirm my argument. Compassion\nmust, in fact, be the stronger, the more the animal beholding any kind of distress identifies himself with\nthe animal that suffers. Now, it is plain that such identification must have been much more perfect in a\nstate of nature than it is in a state of reason. It is reason that engenders self-respect, and reflection that\nconfirms it: it is reason which turns man's mind back upon itself, and divides him from everything that\ncould disturb or afflict him. It is philosophy that isolates him, and bids him say, at sight of the misfortunes\nof others: \"Perish if you will, I am secure.\" Nothing but such general evils as threaten the whole\ncommunity can disturb the tranquil sleep of the philosopher, or tear him from his bed. A murder may with\nimpunity be committed under his window; he has only to put his hands to his ears and argue a little with\nhimself, to prevent nature, which is shocked within him, from identifying itself with the unfortunate\nsufferer. Uncivilised man has not this admirable talent; and for want of reason and wisdom, is always\nfoolishly ready to obey the first promptings of humanity. It is the populace that flocks together at riots and\nstreet-brawls, while the wise man prudently makes off. It is the mob and the market-women, who part the\ncombatants, and hinder gentle-folks from cutting one another's throats.\nIt is then certain that compassion is a natural feeling, which, by moderating the violence of love\nof self in each individual, contributes to the preservation of the whole species. It is this compassion that\nhurries us without reflection to the relief of those who are in distress: it is this which in a state of nature\nsupplies the place of laws, morals and virtues, with the advantage that none are tempted to disobey its\ngentle voice: it is this which will always prevent a sturdy savage from robbing a weak child or a feeble\nold man of the sustenance they may have with pain and difficulty acquired, if he sees a possibility of\nproviding for himself by other means: it is this which, instead of inculcating that sublime maxim of\nrational justice. Do to others as you would have them do unto you, inspires all men with that other maxim\nof natural goodness, much less perfect indeed, but perhaps more useful; Do good to yourself with as little\nevil as possible to others. In a word, it is rather in this natural feeling than in any subtle arguments that we\nmust look for the cause of that repugnance, which every man would experience in doing evil, even\nindependently of the maxims of education. Although it might belong to Socrates and other minds of the\nlike craft to acquire virtue by reason, the human race would long since have ceased to be, had its\npreservation depended only on the reasonings of the individuals composing it.\nWith passions so little active, and so good a curb, men, being rather wild than wicked, and more\nintent to guard themselves against the mischief that might be done them, than to do mischief to others,\nwere by no means subject to very perilous dissensions. They maintained no kind of intercourse with one\nanother, and were consequently strangers to vanity, deference, esteem and contempt; they had not the\nleast idea of meum and tuum, and no true conception of justice; they looked upon every violence to which\nthey were subjected, rather as an injury that might easily be repaired than as a crime that ought to be\npunished; and they never thought of taking revenge, unless perhaps mechanically and on the spot, as a\ndog will sometimes bite the stone which is thrown at him. Their quarrels therefore would seldom have\nvery bloody consequences; for the subject of them would be merely the question of subsistence. But I am\naware of one greater danger, which remains to be noticed.\n\nOf the passions that stir the heart of man, there is one which makes the sexes necessary to each\nother, and is extremely ardent and impetuous; a terrible passion that braves danger, surmounts all\nobstacles, and in its transports seems calculated to bring destruction on the human race which it is really\ndestined to preserve. What must become of men who are left to this brutal and boundless rage, without\nmodesty, without shame, and daily upholding their amours at the price of their blood?\nIt must, in the first place, be allowed that, the more violent the passions are, the more are laws\nnecessary to keep them under restraint. But, setting aside the inadequacy of laws to effect this purpose,\nwhich is evident from the crimes and disorders to which these passions daily give rise among us, we\nshould do well to inquire if these evils did not spring up with the laws themselves; for in this case, even if\nthe laws were capable of repressing such evils, it is the least that could be expected from them, that they\nshould check a mischief which would not have arisen without them.\nLet us begin by distinguishing between the physical and moral ingredients in the feeling of love.\nThe physical part of love is that general desire which urges the sexes to union with each other. The moral\npart is that which determines and fixes this desire exclusively upon one particular object; or at least gives\nit a greater degree of energy toward the object thus preferred. It is easy to see that the moral part of love is\na factitious feeling, born of social usage, and enhanced by the women with much care and cleverness, to\nestablish their empire, and put in power the sex which ought to obey. This feeling, being founded on\ncertain ideas of beauty and merit which a savage is not in a position to acquire, and on comparisons which\nhe is incapable of making, must be for him almost non-existent; for, as his mind cannot form abstract\nideas of proportion and regularity, so his heart is not susceptible of the feelings of love and admiration,\nwhich are even insensibly produced by the application of these ideas. He follows solely the character\nnature has implanted in him, and not tastes which he could never have acquired; so that every woman\nequally answers his purpose.\nMen in a state of nature being confined merely to what is physical in love, and fortunate enough\nto be ignorant of those excellences, which whet the appetite while they increase the difficulty of\ngratifying it, must be subject to fewer and less violent fits of passion, and consequently fall into fewer and\nless violent disputes. The imagination, which causes such ravages among us, never speaks to the heart of\nsavages, who quietly await the impulses of nature, yield to them involuntarily, with more pleasure than\nardour, and, their wants once satisfied, lose the desire. It is therefore incontestable that love, as well as all\nother passions, must have acquired in society that glowing impetuosity, which makes it so often fatal to\nmankind. And it is the more absurd to represent savages as continually cutting one another's throats to\nindulge their brutality, because this opinion is directly contrary to experience; the Caribbeans, who have\nas yet least of all deviated from the state of nature, being in fact the most peaceable of people in their\namours, and the least subject to jealousy, though they live in a hot climate which seems always to inflame\nthe passions.\nWith regard to the inferences that might be drawn, in the case of several species of animals, the\nmales of which fill our poultry-yards with blood and slaughter, or in spring make the forests resound with\ntheir quarrels over their females; we must begin by excluding all those species, in which nature has\nplainly established, in the comparative power of the sexes, relations different from those which exist\namong us: thus we can base no conclusion about men on the habits of fighting cocks. In those species\nwhere the proportion is better observed, these battles must be entirely due to the scarcity of females in\ncomparison with males; or, what amounts to the same thing, to the intervals during which the female\nconstantly refuses the advances of the male: for if each female admits the male but during two months in\nthe year, it is the same as if the number of females were five-sixths less. Now, neither of these two cases\nis applicable to the human species, in which the number of females usually exceeds that of males, and\namong whom it has never been observed, even among savages, that the females have, like those of other\nanimals, their stated times of passion and indifference. Moreover, in several of these species, the\n\nindividuals all take fire at once, and there comes a fearful moment of universal passion, tumult and\ndisorder among them; a scene which is never beheld in the human species, whose love is not thus\nseasonal. We must not then conclude from the combats of such animals for the enjoyment of the females,\nthat the case would be the same with mankind in a state of nature: and, even if we drew such a\nconclusion, we see that such contests do not exterminate other kinds of animals, and we have no reason to\nthink they would be more fatal to ours. It is indeed clear that they would do still less mischief than is the\ncase in a state of society; especially in those countries in which, morals being still held in some repute, the\njealousy of lovers and the vengeance of husbands are the daily cause of duels, murders, and even worse\ncrimes; where the obligation of eternal fidelity only occasions adultery, and the very laws of honour and\ncontinence necessarily increase debauchery and lead to the multiplication of abortions.\nLet us conclude then that man in a state of nature, wandering up and down the forests, without\nindustry, without speech, and without home, an equal stranger to war and to all ties, neither standing in\nneed of his fellow-creatures nor having any desire to hurt them, and perhaps even not distinguishing them\none from another; let us conclude that, being self-sufficient and subject to so few passions, he could have\nno feelings or knowledge but such as befitted his situation; that he felt only his actual necessities, and\ndisregarded everything he did not think himself immediately concerned to notice, and that his\nunderstanding made no greater progress than his vanity. If by accident he made any discovery, he was the\nless able to communicate it to others, as he did not know even his own children. Every art would\nnecessarily perish with its inventor, where there was no kind of education among men, and generations\nsucceeded generations without the least advance; when, all setting out from the same point, centuries\nmust have elapsed in the barbarism of the first ages; when the race was already old, and man remained a\nchild.\nIf I have expatiated at such length on this supposed primitive state, it is because I had so many\nancient errors and inveterate prejudices to eradicate, and therefore thought it incumbent on me to dig\ndown to their very root, and show, by means of a true picture of the state of nature, how far even the\nnatural inequalities of mankind are from having that reality and influence which modern writers suppose.\nIt is in fact easy to see that many of the differences which distinguish men are merely the effect of\nhabit and the different methods of life men adopt in society. Thus a robust or delicate constitution, and the\nstrength or weakness attaching to it, are more frequently the effects of a hardy or effeminate method of\neducation than of the original endowment of the body. It is the same with the powers of the mind; for\neducation not only makes a difference between such as are cultured and such as are not, but even\nincreases the differences which exist among the former, in proportion to their respective degrees of\nculture: as the distance between a giant and a dwarf on the same road increases with every step they take.\nIf we compare the prodigious diversity, which obtains in the education and manner of life of the various\norders of men in the state of society, with the uniformity and simplicity of animal and savage life, in\nwhich every one lives on the same kind of food and in exactly the same manner, and does exactly the\nsame things, it is easy to conceive how much less the difference between man and man must be in a state\nof nature than in a state of society, and how greatly the natural inequality of mankind must be increased\nby the inequalities of social institutions.\nBut even if nature really affected, in the distribution of her gifts, that partiality which is imputed\nto her, what advantage would the greatest of her favourites derive from it, to the detriment of others, in a\nstate that admits of hardly any kind of relation between them? Where there is no love, of what advantage\nis beauty? Of what use is wit to those who do not converse, or cunning to those who have no business\nwith others? I hear it constantly repeated that, in such a state, the strong would oppress the weak; but what\nis here meant by oppression? Some, it is said, would violently domineer over others, who would groan\nunder a servile submission to their caprices. This indeed is exactly what I observe to be the case among\nus; but I do not see how it can be inferred of men in a state of nature, who could not easily be brought to\n\nconceive what we mean by dominion and servitude. One man, it is true, might seize the fruits which\nanother had gathered, the game he had killed, or the cave he had chosen for shelter; but how would he\never be able to exact obedience, and what ties of dependence could there be among men without\npossessions? If, for instance, I am driven from one tree, I can go to the next; if I am disturbed in one\nplace, what hinders me from going to another? Again, should I happen to meet with a man so much\nstronger than myself, and at the same time so depraved, so indolent, and so barbarous, as to compel me to\nprovide for his sustenance while he himself remains idle; he must take care not to have his eyes off me for\na single moment; he must bind me fast before he goes to sleep, or I shall certainly either knock him on the\nhead or make my escape. That is to say, he must in such a case voluntarily expose himself to much greater\ntrouble than he seeks to avoid, or can give me. After all this, let him be off his guard ever so little; let him\nbut turn his head aside at any sudden noise, and I shall be instantly twenty paces off, lost in the forest,\nand, my fetters burst asunder, he would never see me again.\nWithout my expatiating thus uselessly on these details, every one must see that as the bonds of\nservitude are formed merely by the mutual dependence of men on one another and the reciprocal needs\nthat unite them, it is impossible to make any man a slave, unless he be first reduced to a situation in which\nhe cannot do without the help of others: and, since such a situation does not exist in a state of nature,\nevery one is there his own master, and the law of the strongest is of no effect.\nHaving proved that the inequality of mankind is hardly felt, and that its influence is next to\nnothing in a state of nature, I must next show its origin and trace its progress in the successive\ndevelopments of the human mind. Having shown that human perfectibility, the social virtues, and the\nother faculties which natural man potentially possessed, could never develop of themselves, but must\nrequire the fortuitous concurrence of many foreign causes that might never arise, and without which he\nwould have remained for ever in his primitive condition, I must now collect and consider the different\naccidents which may have improved the human understanding while depraving the species, and made\nman wicked while making him sociable; so as to bring him and the world from that distant period to the\npoint at which we now behold them.\nI confess that, as the events I am going to describe might have happened in various ways, I have\nnothing to determine my choice but conjectures: but such conjectures become reasons, when they are the\nmost probable that can be drawn from the nature of things, and the only means of discovering the truth.\nThe consequences, however, which I mean to deduce will not be barely conjectural; as, on the principles\njust laid down, it would be impossible to form any other theory that would not furnish the same results,\nand from which I could not draw the same conclusions.\nThis will be a sufficient apology for my not dwelling on the manner in which the lapse of time\ncompensates for the little probability in the events; on the surprising power of trivial causes, when their\naction is constant; on the impossibility, on the one hand, of destroying certain hypotheses, though on the\nother we cannot give them the certainty of known matters of fact; on its being within the province of\nhistory, when two facts are given as real, and have to be connected by a series of intermediate facts,\nwhich are unknown or supposed to be so, to supply such facts as may connect them; and on its being in\nthe province of philosophy when history is silent, to determine similar facts to serve the same end; and\nlastly, on the influence of similarity, which, in the case of events, reduces the facts to a much smaller\nnumber of different classes than is commonly imagined. It is enough for me to offer these hints to the\nconsideration of my judges, and to have so arranged that the general reader has no need to consider them\nat all.\nTHE SECOND PART\n\nTHE first man who, having enclosed a piece of ground, bethought himself of saying This is mine,\nand found people simple enough to believe him, was the real founder of civil society. From how many\ncrimes, wars and murders, from how many horrors and misfortunes might not any one have saved\nmankind, by pulling up the stakes, or filling up the ditch, and crying to his fellows, \"Beware of listening\nto this impostor; you are undone if you once forget that the fruits of the earth belong to us all, and the\nearth itself to nobody.\" But there is great probability that things had then already come to such a pitch,\nthat they could no longer continue as they were; for the idea of property depends on many prior ideas,\nwhich could only be acquired successively, and cannot have been formed all at once in the human mind.\nMankind must have made very considerable progress, and acquired considerable knowledge and industry\nwhich they must also have transmitted and increased from age to age, before they arrived at this last point\nof the state of nature. Let us then go farther back, and endeavour to unify under a single point of view that\nslow succession of events and discoveries in the most natural order.\nMan's first feeling was that of his own existence, and his first care that of self-preservation. The\nproduce of the earth furnished him with all he needed, and instinct told him how to use it. Hunger and\nother appetites made him at various times experience various modes of existence; and among these was\none which urged him to propagate his species C a blind propensity that, having nothing to do with the\nheart, produced a merely animal act. The want once gratified, the two sexes knew each other no more;\nand even the offspring was nothing to its mother, as soon as it could do without her.\nSuch was the condition of infant man; the life of an animal limited at first to mere sensations, and\nhardly profiting by the gifts nature bestowed on him, much less capable of entertaining a thought of\nforcing anything from her. But difficulties soon presented themselves, and it became necessary to learn\nhow to surmount them: the height of the trees, which prevented him from gathering their fruits, the\ncompetition of other animals desirous of the same fruits, and the ferocity of those who needed them for\ntheir own preservation, all obliged him to apply himself to bodily exercises. He had to be active, swift of\nfoot, and vigorous in fight. Natural weapons, stones and sticks, were easily found: he learnt to surmount\nthe obstacles of nature, to contend in case of necessity with other animals, and to dispute for the means of\nsubsistence even with other men, or to indemnify himself for what he was forced to give up to a stronger.\nIn proportion as the human race grew more numerous, men's cares increased. The difference of\nsoils, climates and seasons, must have introduced some differences into their manner of living. Barren\nyears, long and sharp winters, scorching summers which parched the fruits of the earth, must have\ndemanded a new industry. On the seashore and the banks of rivers, they invented the hook and line, and\nbecame fishermen and eaters of fish. In the forests they made bows and arrows, and became huntsmen\nand warriors. In cold countries they clothed themselves with the skins of the beasts they had slain. The\nlightning, a volcano, or some lucky chance acquainted them with fire, a new resource against the rigours\nof winter: they next learned how to preserve this element, then how to reproduce it, and finally how to\nprepare with it the flesh of animals which before they had eaten raw.\nThis repeated relevance of various beings to himself, and one to another, would naturally give\nrise in the human mind to the perceptions of certain relations between them. Thus the relations which we\ndenote by the terms, great, small, strong, weak, swift, slow, fearful, bold, and the like, almost insensibly\ncompared at need, must have at length produced in him a kind of reflection, or rather a mechanical\nprudence, which would indicate to him the precautions most necessary to his security.\nThe new intelligence which resulted from this development increased his superiority over other\nanimals, by making him sensible of it. He would now endeavour, therefore, to ensnare them, would play\nthem a thousand tricks, and though many of them might surpass him in swiftness or in strength, would in\ntime become the master of some and the scourge of others. Thus, the first time he looked into himself, he\nfelt the first emotion of pride; and, at a time when he scarce knew how to distinguish the different orders\n\nof beings, by looking upon his species as of the highest order, he prepared the way for assuming\npre-eminence as an individual.\nOther men, it is true, were not then to him what they now are to us, and he had no greater\nintercourse with them than with other animals; yet they were not neglected in his observations. The\nconformities, which he would in time discover between them, and between himself and his female, led\nhim to judge of others which were not then perceptible; and finding that they all behaved as he himself\nwould have done in like circumstances, he naturally inferred that their manner of thinking and acting was\naltogether in conformity with his own. This important truth, once deeply impressed on his mind, must\nhave induced him, from an intuitive feeling more certain and much more rapid than any kind of\nreasoning, to pursue the rules of conduct, which he had best observe towards them, for his own security\nand advantage.\nTaught by experience that the love of well-being is the sole motive of human actions, he found\nhimself in a position to distinguish the few cases, in which mutual interest might justify him in relying\nupon the assistance of his fellows; and also the still fewer cases in which a conflict of interests might give\ncause to suspect them. In the former case, he joined in the same herd with them, or at most in some kind\nof loose association, that laid no restraint on its members, and lasted no longer than the transitory\noccasion that formed it. In the latter case, every one sought his own private advantage, either by open\nforce, if he thought himself strong enough, or by address and cunning, if he felt himself the weaker.\nIn this manner, men may have insensibly acquired some gross ideas of mutual undertakings, and\nof the advantages of fulfilling them: that is, just so far as their present and apparent interest was\nconcerned: for they were perfect strangers to foresight, and were so far from troubling themselves about\nthe distant future, that they hardly thought of the morrow. If a deer was to be taken, every one saw that, in\norder to succeed, he must abide faithfully by his post: but if a hare happened to come within the reach of\nany one of them, it is not to be doubted that he pursued it without scruple, and, having seized his prey,\ncared very little, if by so doing he caused his companions to miss theirs.\nIt is easy to understand that such intercourse would not require a language much more refined\nthan that of rooks or monkeys, who associate together for much the same purpose. Inarticulate cries,\nplenty of gestures and some imitative sounds, must have been for a long time the universal language; and\nby the addition, in every country, of some conventional articulate sounds (of which, as I have already\nintimated, the first institution is not too easy to explain) particular languages were produced; but these\nwere rude and imperfect, and nearly such as are now to be found among some savage nations.\nHurried on by the rapidity of time, by the abundance of things I have to say, and by the almost\ninsensible progress of things in their beginnings, I pass over in an instant a multitude of ages; for the\nslower the events were in their succession, the more rapidly may they be described.\nThese first advances enabled men to make others with greater rapidity. In proportion as they grew\nenlightened, they grew industrious. They ceased to fall asleep under the first tree, or in the first cave that\nafforded them shelter; they invented several kinds of implements of hard and sharp stones, which they\nused to dig up the earth, and to cut wood; they then made huts out of branches, and afterwards learnt to\nplaster them over with mud and clay. This was the epoch of a first revolution, which established and\ndistinguished families, and introduced a kind of property, in itself the source of a thousand quarrels and\nconflicts. As, however, the strongest were probably the first to build themselves huts which they felt\nthemselves able to defend, it may be concluded that the weak found it much easier and safer to imitate,\nthan to attempt to dislodge them: and of those who were once provided with huts, none could have any\ninducement to appropriate that of his neighbour; not indeed so much because it did not belong to him, as\nbecause it could be of no use, and he could not make himself master of it without exposing himself to a\n\ndesperate battle with the family which occupied it.\nThe first expansions of the human heart were the effects of a novel situation, which united\nhusbands and wives, fathers and children, under one roof. The habit of living together soon gave rise to\nthe finest feelings known to humanity, conjugal love and paternal affection. Every family became a little\nsociety, the more united because liberty and reciprocal attachment were the only bonds of its union. The\nsexes, whose manner of life had been hitherto the same, began now to adopt different ways of living. The\nwomen became more sedentary, and accustomed themselves to mind the hut and their children, while the\nmen went abroad in search of their common subsistence. From living a softer life, both sexes also began\nto lose something of their strength and ferocity: but, if individuals became to some extent less able to\nencounter wild beasts separately, they found it, on the other hand, easier to assemble and resist in\ncommon.\nThe simplicity and solitude of man's life in this new condition, the paucity of his wants, and the\nimplements he had invented to satisfy them, left him a great deal of leisure, which he employed to furnish\nhimself with many conveniences unknown to his fathers: and this was the first yoke he inadvertently\nimposed on himself, and the first source of the evils he prepared for his descendants. For, besides\ncontinuing thus to enervate both body and mind, these conveniences lost with use almost all their power\nto please, and even degenerated into real needs, till the want of them became far more disagreeable than\nthe possession of them had been pleasant. Men would have been unhappy at the loss of them, though the\npossession did not make them happy.\nWe can here see a little better how the use of speech became established, and insensibly improved\nin each family, and we may form a conjecture also concerning the manner in which various causes may\nhave extended and accelerated the progress of language, by making it more and more necessary. Floods or\nearthquakes surrounded inhabited districts with precipices or waters: revolutions of the globe tore off\nportions from the continent, and made them islands. It is readily seen that among men thus collected and\ncompelled to live together, a common idiom must have arisen much more easily than among those who\nstill wandered through the forests of the continent. Thus it is very possible that after their first essays in\nnavigation the islanders brought over the use of speech to the continent: and it is at least very probable\nthat communities and languages were first established in islands, and even came to perfection there before\nthey were known on the mainland.\nEverything now begins to change its aspect. Men, who have up to now been roving in the woods,\nby taking to a more settled manner of life, come gradually together, form separate bodies, and at length in\nevery country arises a distinct nation, united in character and manners, not by regulations or laws, but by\nuniformity of life and food, and the common influence of climate. Permanent neighbourhood could not\nfail to produce, in time, some connection between different families. Among young people of opposite\nsexes, living in neighbouring huts, the transient commerce required by nature soon led, through mutual\nintercourse, to another kind not less agreeable, and more permanent. Men began now to take the\ndifference between objects into account, and to make comparisons; they acquired imperceptibly the ideas\nof beauty and merit, which soon gave rise to feelings of preference. In consequence of seeing each other\noften, they could not do without seeing each other constantly. A tender and pleasant feeling insinuated\nitself into their souls, and the least opposition turned it into an impetuous fury: with love arose jealousy;\ndiscord triumphed, and human blood was sacrificed to the gentlest of all passions.\nAs ideas and feelings succeeded one another, and heart and head were brought into play, men\ncontinued to lay aside their original wildness; their private connections became every day more intimate\nas their limits extended. They accustomed themselves to assemble before their huts round a large tree;\nsinging and dancing, the true offspring of love and leisure, became the amusement, or rather the\noccupation, of men and women thus assembled together with nothing else to do. Each one began to\n\nconsider the rest, and to wish to be considered in turn; and thus a value came to be attached to public\nesteem. Whoever sang or danced best, whoever was the handsomest, the strongest, the most dexterous, or\nthe most eloquent, came to be of most consideration; and this was the first step towards inequality, and at\nthe same time towards vice. From these first distinctions arose on the one side vanity and contempt and\non the other shame and envy: and the fermentation caused by these new leavens ended by producing\ncombinations fatal to innocence and happiness.\nAs soon as men began to value one another, and the idea of esteem had got a footing in the mind,\nevery one put in his claim to it, and it became impossible to refuse it to any with impunity. Hence arose\nthe first obligations of civility even among savages; and every intended injury became an affront;\nbecause, besides the hurt which might result from it, the party injured was certain to find in it a contempt\nfor his person, which was often more insupportable than the hurt itself.\nThus, as every man punished the contempt shown him by others, in proportion to his opinion of\nhimself, revenge became terrible, and men bloody and cruel. This is precisely the state reached by most of\nthe savage nations known to us: and it is for want of having made a proper distinction in our ideas, and\nsee how very far they already are from the state of nature, that so many writers have hastily concluded\nthat man is naturally cruel, and requires civil institutions to make him more mild; whereas nothing is\nmore gentle than man in his primitive state, as he is placed by nature at an equal distance from the\nstupidity of brutes, and the fatal ingenuity of civilised man. Equally confined by instinct and reason to the\nsole care of guarding himself against the mischiefs which threaten him, he is restrained by natural\ncompassion from doing any injury to others, and is not led to do such a thing even in return for injuries\nreceived. For, according to the axiom of the wise Locke, There can be no injury, where there is no\nproperty.\nBut it must be remarked that the society thus formed, and the relations thus established among\nmen, required of them qualities different from those which they possessed from their primitive\nconstitution. Morality began to appear in human actions, and every one, before the institution of law, was\nthe only judge and avenger of the injuries done him, so that the goodness which was suitable in the pure\nstate of nature was no longer proper in the new-born state of society. Punishments had to be made more\nsevere, as opportunities of offending became more frequent, and the dread of vengeance had to establish\nthe place later occupied by the rigour of the law. Thus, though men had become less patient, and their\nnatural compassion had already suffered some diminution, this period of expansion of the human\nfaculties, keeping a just mean between the indolence of the primitive state and the petulant activity of our\negoism, must have been the happiest and most stable of epochs. The more we reflect on it, the more we\nshall find that this state was the least subject to revolutions, and altogether the very best man could\nexperience; so that he can have departed from it only through some fatal accident, which, for the public\ngood, should never have happened. The example of savages, most of whom have been found in this state,\nseems to prove that men were meant to remain in it, that it is the real youth of the world, and that all\nsubsequent advances have been apparently so many steps towards the perfection of the individual, but in\nreality towards the decrepitude of the species.\nSo long as men remained content with their rustic huts, so long as they were satisfied with clothes\nmade of the skins of animals and sewn together with thorns and fish-bones, adorned themselves only with\nfeathers and shells, and continued to paint their bodies different colours, to improve and beautify their\nbows and arrows and to make with sharp-edged stones fishing boats or clumsy musical instruments; in a\nword, so long as they undertook only what a single person could accomplish, and confined themselves to\nsuch arts as did not require the joint labour of several hands, they lived free, healthy, honest and happy\nlives, so long as their nature allowed, and as they continued to enjoy the pleasures of mutual and\nindependent intercourse. But from the moment one man began to stand in need of the help of another;\nfrom the moment it appeared advantageous to any one man to have enough provisions for two, equality\n\ndisappeared, property was introduced, work became indispensable, and vast forests became smiling fields,\nwhich man had to water with the sweat of his brow, and where slavery and misery were soon seen to\ngerminate and grow up with the crops.\nMetallurgy and agriculture were the two arts which produced this great revolution. The poets tell\nus it was gold and silver, but, for the philosophers, it was iron and corn, which first civilised men, and\nruined humanity. Thus both were unknown to the savages of America, who for that reason are still\nsavage: the other nations also seem to have continued in a state of barbarism while they practised only\none of these arts. One of the best reasons, perhaps, why Europe has been, if not longer, at least more\nconstantly and highly civilised than the rest of the world, is that it is at once the most abundant in iron and\nthe most fertile in corn.\nIt is difficult to conjecture how men first came to know and use iron; for it is impossible to\nsuppose they would of themselves think of digging the ore out of the mine, and preparing it for smelting,\nbefore they knew what would be the result. On the other hand, we have the less reason to suppose this\ndiscovery the effect of any accidental fire, as mines are only formed in barren places, bare of trees and\nplants; so that it looks as if nature had taken pains to keep that fatal secret from us. There remains,\ntherefore, only the extraordinary accident of some volcano which, by ejecting metallic substances already\nin fusion, suggested to the spectators the idea of imitating the natural operation. And we must further\nconceive them as possessed of uncommon courage and foresight, to undertake so laborious a work, with\nso distant a prospect of drawing advantage from it; yet these qualities are united only in minds more\nadvanced than we can suppose those of these first discoverers to have been.\nWith regard to agriculture, the principles of it were known long before they were put in practice;\nand it is indeed hardly possible that men, constantly employed in drawing their subsistence from plants\nand trees, should not readily acquire a knowledge of the means made use of by nature for the propagation\nof vegetables. It was in all probability very long, however, before their industry took that turn, either\nbecause trees, which together with hunting and fishing afforded them food, did not require their attention;\nor because they were ignorant of the use of corn, or without instruments to cultivate it; or because they\nlacked foresight to future needs; or lastily, because they were without means of preventing others from\nrobbing them of the fruit of their labour.\nWhen they grew more industrious, it is natural to believe that they began, with the help of sharp\nstones and pointed sticks, to cultivate a few vegetables or roots around their huts; though it was long\nbefore they knew how to prepare corn, or were provided with the implements necessary for raising it in\nany large quantity; not to mention how essential it is, for husbandry, to consent to immediate loss, in\norder to reap a future gain C a precaution very foreign to the turn of a savage's mind; for, as I have said,\nhe hardly foresees in the morning what he will need at night.\nThe invention of the other arts must therefore have been necessary to compel mankind to apply\nthemselves to agriculture. No sooner were artificers wanted to smelt and forge iron, than others were\nrequired to maintain them; the more hands that were employed in manufactures, the fewer were left to\nprovide for the common subsistence, though the number of mouths to be furnished with food remained\nthe same: and as some required commodities in exchange for their iron, the rest at length discovered the\nmethod of making iron serve for the multiplication of commodities. By this means the arts of husbandry\nand agriculture were established on the one hand, and the art of working metals and multiplying their uses\non the other.\nThe cultivation of the earth necessarily brought about its distribution; and property, once\nrecognised, gave rise to the first rules of justice; for, to secure each man his own, it had to be possible for\neach to have something. Besides, as men began to look forward to the future, and all had something to\nlose, every one had reason to apprehend that reprisals would follow any injury he might do to another.\n\nThis origin is so much the more natural, as it is impossible to conceive how property can come from\nanything but manual labour: for what else can a man add to things which he does not originally create, so\nas to make them his own property? It is the husbandman's labour alone that, giving him a title to the\nproduce of the ground he has tilled, gives him a claim also to the land itself, at least till harvest, and so,\nfrom year to year, a constant possession which is easily transformed into property. When the ancients,\nsays Grotius, gave to Ceres the title of Legislatrix, and to a festival celebrated in her honour the name of\nThesmophoria, they meant by that that the distribution of lands had produced a new kind of right: that is\nto say, the right of property, which is different from the right deducible from the law of nature.\nIn this state of affairs, equality might have been sustained, had the talents of individuals been\nequal, and had, for example, the use of iron and the consumption of commodities always exactly balanced\neach other; but, as there was nothing to preserve this balance, it was soon disturbed; the strongest did\nmost work; the most skilful turned his labour to best account; the most ingenious devised methods of\ndiminishing his labour: the farmers wanted more iron, or the blacksmiths more corn, and, while all\nlaboured equally, some gained a great deal by his work, while others could hardly support themselves.\nThus natural inequality unfolds itself insensibly with that of combination, and the difference between\nmen, developed by their different circumstances, becomes more sensible and permanent in its effects, and\nbegins to have an influence, in the same proportion, over the lot of individuals.\nMatters once at this pitch, it is easy to imagine the rest. I shall not detain the reader with a\ndescription of the successive invention of other arts, the development of language, the trial and utilisation\nof talents, the inequality of fortunes, the use and abuse of riches, and all the details connected with them\nwhich the reader can easily supply for himself. I shall confine myself to a glance at mankind in this new\nsituation.\nBehold then all human faculties developed, memory and imagination in full play, egoism\ninterested, reason active, and the mind almost at the highest point of its perfection. Behold all the natural\nqualities in action, the rank and condition of every man assigned him; not merely his share of property\nand his power to serve or injure others, but also his wit, beauty, strength or skill, merit or talents: and\nthese being the only qualities capable of commanding respect, it soon became necessary to possess or to\naffect them.\nIt now became the interest of men to appear what they really were not. To be and to seem became\ntwo totally different things; and from this distinction sprang insolent pomp and cheating trickery, with all\nthe numerous vices that go in their train. On the other hand, free and independent as men were before,\nthey were now, in consequence of a multiplicity of new wants, brought into subjection, as it were, to all\nnature, and particularly to one another; and each became in some degree a slave even in becoming the\nmaster of other men: if rich, they stood in need of the services of others; if poor, of their assistance; and\neven a middle condition did not enable them to do without one another. Man must now, therefore, have\nbeen perpetually employed in getting others to interest themselves in his lot, and in making them,\napparently at least, if not really, find their advantage in promoting his own. Thus he must have been sly\nand artful in his behaviour to some, and imperious and cruel to others; being under a kind of necessity to\nill-use all the persons of whom he stood in need, when he could not frighten them into compliance, and\ndid not judge it his interest to be useful to them. Insatiable ambition, the thirst of raising their respective\nfortunes, not so much from real want as from the desire to surpass others, inspired all men with a vile\npropensity to injure one another, and with a secret jealousy, which is the more dangerous, as it puts on the\nmask of benevolence, to carry its point with greater security. In a word, there arose rivalry and\ncompetition on the one hand, and conflicting interests on the other, together with a secret desire on both\nof profiting at the expense of others. All these evils were the first effects of property, and the inseparable\nattendants of growing inequality.\nBefore the invention of signs to represent riches, wealth could hardly consist in anything but\n\nlands and cattle, the only real possessions men can have. But, when inheritances so increased in number\nand extent as to occupy the whole of the land, and to border on one another, one man could aggrandise\nhimself only at the expense of another; at the same time the supernumeraries, who had been too weak or\ntoo indolent to make such acquisitions, and had grown poor without sustaining any loss, because, while\nthey saw everything change around them, they remained still the same, were obliged to receive their\nsubsistence, or steal it, from the rich; and this soon bred, according to their different characters, dominion\nand slavery, or violence and rapine. The wealthy, on their part, had no sooner begun to taste the pleasure\nof command, than they disdained all others, and, using their old slaves to acquire new, thought of nothing\nbut subduing and enslaving their neighbours; like ravenous wolves, which, having once tasted human\nflesh, despise every other food and thenceforth seek only men to devour.\nThus, as the most powerful and the most miserable both considered their might or misery as a\nkind of right to the possessions of others, equivalent, in their opinion, to that of property, the destruction\nof equality was attended by the most terrible disorders. Usurpations by the rich, robbery by the poor, and\nthe unbridled passions of both, suppressed the cries of natural compassion and the still feeble voice of\njustice, and filled men with avarice, ambition and vice. Between the title of the strongest and that of the\nfirst occupier, there arose perpetual conflicts, which never ended but in battles and bloodshed. The\nnew-born state of society thus gave rise to a horrible state of war; men thus harassed and depraved were\nno longer capable of retracing their steps or renouncing the fatal acquisitions they had made, but,\nlabouring by the abuse of the faculties which do them honour, merely to their own confusion, brought\nthemselves to the brink of ruin.\nBoth rich and poor, shocked at their new-found ills,\nWould fly from wealth, and lose what they had sought.\nOvid, Metamorphoses, xi. 127.\nIt is impossible that men should not at length have reflected on so wretched a situation, and on\nthe calamities that overwhelmed them. The rich, in particular, must have felt how much they suffered by a\nconstant state of war, of which they bore all the expense; and in which, though all risked their lives, they\nalone risked their property. Besides, however speciously they might disguise their usurpations, they knew\nthat they were founded on precarious and false titles; so that, if others took from them by force what they\nthemselves had gained by force, they would have no reason to complain. Even those who had been\nenriched by their own industry, could hardly base their proprietorship on better claims. It was in vain to\nrepeat, \"I built this well; I gained this spot by my industry.\" Who gave you your standing, it might be\nanswered, and what right have you to demand payment of us for doing what we never asked you to do?\nDo you not know that numbers of your fellow-creatures are starving, for want of what you have too much\nof? You ought to have had the express and universal consent of mankind, before appropriating more of\nthe common subsistence than you needed for your own maintenance. Destitute of valid reasons to justify\nand sufficient strength to defend himself, able to crush individuals with ease, but easily crushed himself\nby a troop of bandits, one against all, and incapable, on account of mutual jealousy, of joining with his\nequals against numerous enemies united by the common hope of plunder, the rich man, thus urged by\nnecessity, conceived at length the profoundest plan that ever entered the mind of man: this was to employ\nin his favour the forces of those who attacked him, to make allies of his adversaries, to inspire them with\ndifferent maxims, and to give them other institutions as favourable to himself as the law of nature was\nunfavourable.\nWith this view, after having represented to his neighbours the horror of a situation which armed\nevery man against the rest, and made their possessions as burdensome to them as their wants, and in\nwhich no safety could be expected either in riches or in poverty, he readily devised plausible arguments to\nmake them close with his design. \"Let us join,\" said he, \"to guard the weak from oppression, to restrain\nthe ambitious, and secure to every man the possession of what belongs to him: let us institute rules of\n\njustice and peace, to which all without exception may be obliged to conform; rules that may in some\nmeasure make amends for the caprices of fortune, by subjecting equally the powerful and the weak to the\nobservance of reciprocal obligations. Let us, in a word, instead of turning our forces against ourselves,\ncollect them in a supreme power which may govern us by wise laws, protect and defend all the members\nof the association, repulse their common enemies, and maintain eternal harmony among us.\"\nFar fewer words to this purpose would have been enough to impose on men so barbarous and\neasily seduced; especially as they had too many disputes among themselves to do without arbitrators, and\ntoo much ambition and avarice to go long without masters. All ran headlong to their chains, in hopes of\nsecuring their liberty; for they had just wit enough to perceive the advantages of political institutions,\nwithout experience enough to enable them to foresee the dangers. The most capable of foreseeing the\ndangers were the very persons who expected to benefit by them; and even the most prudent judged it not\ninexpedient to sacrifice one part of their freedom to ensure the rest; as a wounded man has his arm cut off\nto save the rest of his body.\nSuch was, or may well have been, the origin of society and law, which bound new fetters on the\npoor, and gave new powers to the rich; which irretrievably destroyed natural liberty, eternally fixed the\nlaw of property and inequality, converted clever usurpation into unalterable right, and, for the advantage\nof a few ambitious individuals, subjected all mankind to perpetual labour, slavery and wretchedness. It is\neasy to see how the establishment of one community made that of all the rest necessary, and how, in order\nto make head against united forces, the rest of mankind had to unite in turn. Societies soon multiplied and\nspread over the face of the earth, till hardly a corner of the world was left in which a man could escape the\nyoke, and withdraw his head from beneath the sword which he saw perpetually hanging over him by a\nthread. Civil right having thus become the common rule among the members of each community, the law\nof nature maintained its place only between different communities, where, under the name of the right of\nnations, it was qualified by certain tacit conventions, in order to make commerce practicable, and serve as\na substitute for natural compassion, which lost, when applied to societies, almost all the influence it had\nover individuals, and survived no longer except in some great cosmopolitan spirits, who, breaking down\nthe imaginary barriers that separate different peoples, follow the example of our Sovereign Creator, and\ninclude the whole human race in their benevolence.\nBut bodies politic, remaining thus in a state of nature among themselves, presently experienced\nthe inconveniences which had obliged individuals to forsake it; for this state became still more fatal to\nthese great bodies than it had been to the individuals of whom they were composed. Hence arose national\nwars, battles, murders, and reprisals, which shock nature and outrage reason; together with all those\nhorrible prejudices which class among the virtues the honour of shedding human blood. The most\ndistinguished men hence learned to consider cutting each other's throats a duty; at length men massacred\ntheir fellow-creatures by thousands without so much as knowing why, and committed more murders in a\nsingle day's fighting, and more violent outrages in the sack of a single town, than were committed in the\nstate of nature during whole ages over the whole earth. Such were the first effects which we can see to\nhave followed the division of mankind into different communities. But let us return to their institutions.\nI know that some writers have given other explanations of the origin of political societies, such as\nthe conquest of the powerful, or the association of the weak. It is, indeed, indifferent to my argument\nwhich of these causes we choose. That which I have just laid down, however, appears to me the most\nnatural for the following reasons. First: because, in the first case, the right of conquest, being no right in\nitself, could not serve as a foundation on which to build any other; the victor and the vanquished people\nstill remained with respect to each other in the state of war, unless the vanquished, restored to the full\npossession of their liberty, voluntarily made choice of the victor for their chief. For till then, whatever\ncapitulation may have been made being founded on violence, and therefore ipso facto void, there could\nnot have been on this hypothesis either a real society or body politic, or any law other than that of the\nstrongest. Secondly: because the words strong and weak are, in the second case, ambiguous; for during\n\nthe interval between the establishment of a right of property, or prior occupancy, and that of political\ngovernment, the meaning of these words is better expressed by the terms rich and poor: because, in fact,\nbefore the institution of laws, men had no other way of reducing their equals to submission, than by\nattacking their goods, or making some of their own over to them. Thirdly: because, as the poor had\nnothing but their freedom to lose, it would have been in the highest degree absurd for them to resign\nvoluntarily the only good they still enjoyed, without getting anything in exchange: whereas the rich\nhaving feelings, if I may so express myself, in every part of their possessions, it was much easier to harm\nthem, and therefore more necessary for them to take precautions against it; and, in short, because it is\nmore reasonable to suppose a thing to have been invented by those to whom it would be of service, than\nby those whom it must have harmed.\nGovernment had, in its infancy, no regular and constant form. The want of experience and\nphilosophy prevented men from seeing any but present inconveniences, and they thought of pr\ning against others only as they presented themselves. In spite of the endeavours of the wisest\nlegislators, the political state remained imperfect, because it was little more than the work of chance; and,\nas it had begun ill, though time revealed its defects and suggested remedies, the original faults were never\nrepaired. It was continually being patched up, when the first task should have been to get the site cleared\nand all the old materials removed, as was done by Lycurgus at Sparta, if a stable and lasting edifice was to\nbe erected. Society consisted at first merely of a few general conventions, which every member bound\nhimself to observe; and for the performance of covenants the whole body went security to each\nindividual. Experience only could show the weakness of such a constitution, and how easily it might be\ninfringed with impunity, from the difficulty of convicting men of faults, where the public alone was to be\nwitness and judge: the laws could not but be eluded in many ways; disorders and inconveniences could\nnot but multiply continually, till it became necessary to commit the dangerous trust of public authority to\nprivate persons, and the care of enforcing obedience to the deliberations of the people to the magistrate.\nFor to say that chiefs were chosen before the confederacy was formed, and that the administrators of the\nlaws were there before the laws themselves, is too absurd a supposition to consider seriously.\nIt would be as unreasonable to suppose that men at first threw themselves irretrievably and\nunconditionally into the arms of an absolute master, and that the first expedient which proud and\nunsubdued men hit upon for their common security was to run headlong into slavery. For what reason, in\nfact, did they take to themselves superiors, if it was not in order that they might be defended from\noppression, and have protection for their lives, liberties and properties, which are, so to speak, the\nconstituent elements of their being? Now, in the relations between man and man, the worst that can\nhappen is for one to find himself at the mercy of another, and it would have been inconsistent with\ncommon-sense to begin by bestowing on a chief the only things they wanted his help to preserve. What\nequivalent could he offer them for so great a right? And if he had presumed to exact it under pretext of\ndefending them, would he not have received the answer recorded in the fable: \"What more can the enemy\ndo to us?\" It is therefore beyond dispute, and indeed the fundamental maxim of all political right, that\npeople have set up chiefs to protect their liberty, and not to enslave them. If we have a prince, said Pliny\nto Trajan, it is to save ourselves from having a master.\nPoliticians indulge in the same sophistry about the love of liberty as philosophers about the state\nof nature. They judge, by what they see, of very different things, which they have not seen; and attribute\nto man a natural propensity to servitude, because the slaves within their observation are seen to bear the\nyoke with patience; they fail to reflect that it is with liberty as with innocence and virtue; the value is\nknown only to those who possess them, and the taste for them is forfeited when they are forfeited\nthemselves. \"I know the charms of your country,\" said Brasidas to a satrap, who was comparing the life at\nSparta with that at Persepolis, \"but you cannot know the pleasures of mine.\"\n\nAn unbroken horse erects his mane, paws the ground and starts back impetuously at the sight of\nthe bridle; while one which is properly trained suffers patiently even whip and spur: so savage man will\nnot bend his neck to the yoke to which civilised man submits without a murmur, but prefers the most\nturbulent state of liberty to the most peaceful slavery. We cannot therefore, from the servility of nations\nalready enslaved, judge of the natural disposition of mankind for or against slavery; we should go by the\nprodigious efforts of every free people to save itself from oppression. I know that the former are for ever\nholding forth in praise of the tranquillity they enjoy in their chains, and that they call a state of wretched\nservitude a state of peace: miserrimam servitutem pacem appellant.4 But when I observe the latter\nsacrificing pleasure, peace, wealth, power and life itself to the preservation of that one treasure, which is\nso disdained by those who have lost it; when I see free-born animals dash their brains out against the bars\nof their cage, from an innate impatience of captivity; when I behold numbers of naked savages, that\ndespise European pleasures, braving hunger, fire, the sword and death, to preserve nothing but their\nindependence, I feel that it is not for slaves to argue about liberty.\nWith regard to paternal authority, from which some writers have derived absolute government\nand all society, it is enough, without going back to the contrary arguments of Locke and Sidney, to\nremark that nothing on earth can be further from the ferocious spirit of despotism than the mildness of\nthat authority which looks more to the advantage of him who obeys than to that of him who commands;\nthat, by the law of nature, the father is the child's master no longer than his help is necessary; that from\nthat time they are both equal, the son being perfectly independent of the father, and owing him only\nrespect and not obedience. For gratitude is a duty which ought to be paid, but not a right to be exacted:\ninstead of saying that civil society is derived from paternal authority, we ought to say rather that the latter\nderives its principal force from the former. No individual was ever acknowledged as the father of many,\ntill his sons and daughters remained settled around him. The goods of the father, of which he is really the\nmaster, are the ties which keep his children in dependence, and he may bestow on them, if he pleases, no\nshare of his property, unless they merit it by constant deference to his will. But the subjects of an arbitrary\ndespot are so far from having the like favour to expect from their chief, that they themselves and\neverything they possess are his property, or at least are considered by him as such; so that they are forced\nto receive, as a favour, the little of their own he is pleased to leave them. When he despoils them, he does\nbut justice, and mercy in that he permits them to live.\nBy proceeding thus to test fact by right, we should discover as little reason as truth in the\nvoluntary establishment of tyranny. It would also be no easy matter to prove the validity of a contract\nbinding on only one of the parties, where all the risk is on one side, and none on the other; so that no one\ncould suffer but he who bound himself. This hateful system is indeed, even in modern times, very far\nfrom being that of wise and good monarchs, and especially of the kings of France; as may be seen from\nseveral passages in their edicts; particularly from the following passage in a celebrated edict published in\n1667 in the name and by order of Louis XIV.\n\"Let it not, therefore, be said that the Sovereign is not subject to the laws of his State; since the\ncontrary is a true proposition of the right of nations, which flattery has sometimes attacked but good\nprinces have always defended as the tutelary divinity of their dominions. How much more legitimate is it\nto say with the wise Plato, that the perfect felicity of a kingdom consists in the obedience of subjects to\ntheir prince, and of the prince to the laws, and in the laws being just and constantly directed to the public\ngood!\"5\n4Tacitus, Hist. iv. 17. The most wretched slavery they call peace.\n5Of the Rights of the Most Christian Queen over Various States of the Monarchy of Spain, 1667.\n\nI shall not stay here to inquire whether, as liberty is the noblest faculty of man, it is not degrading\nour very nature, reducing ourselves to the level of the brutes, which are mere slaves of instinct, and even\nan affront to the Author of our being, to renounce without reserve the most precious of all His gifts, and to\nbow to the necessity of committing all the crimes He has forbidden, merely to gratify a mad or a cruel\nmaster; or if this sublime craftsman ought not to be less angered at seeing His workmanship entirely\ndestroyed than thus dishonoured. I will waive (if my opponents please) the authority of Barbeyrac, who,\nfollowing Locke, roundly declares that no man can so far sell his liberty as to submit to an arbitrary power\nwhich may use him as it likes. For, he adds, this would be to sell his own life, of which he is not master. I\nshall ask only what right those who were not afraid thus to debase themselves could have to subject their\nposterity to the same ignominy, and to renounce for them those blessings which they do not owe to the\nliberality of their progenitors, and without which life itself must be a burden to all who are worthy of it.\nPuffendorf says that we may divest ourselves of our liberty in favour of other men, just as we\ntransfer our property from one to another by contracts and agreements. But this seems a very weak\nargument. For in the first place, the property I alienate becomes quite foreign to me, nor can I suffer from\nthe abuse of it; but it very nearly concerns me that my liberty should not be abused, and I cannot without\nincurring the guilt of the crimes I may be compelled to commit, expose myself to become an instrument\nof crime. Besides, the right of property being only a convention of human institution, men may dispose of\nwhat they possess as they please: but this is not the case with the essential gifts of nature, such as life and\nliberty, which every man is permitted to enjoy, and of which it is at least doubtful whether any have a\nright to divest themselves. By giving up the one, we degrade our being; by giving up the other, we do our\nbest to annul it; and, as no temporal good can indemnify us for the loss of either, it would be an offence\nagainst both reason and nature to renounce them at any price whatsoever. But, even if we could transfer\nour liberty, as we do our property, there would be a great difference with regard to the children, who\nenjoy the father's substance only by the transmission of his right; whereas, liberty being a gift which they\nhold from nature as being men, their parents have no right whatever to deprive them of it. As then, to\nestablish slavery, it was necessary to do violence to nature, so, in order to perpetuate such a right, nature\nwould have to be changed. Jurists, who have gravely determined that the child of a slave comes into the\nworld a slave, have decided, in other words, that a man shall come into the world not a man.\nI regard it then as certain, that government did not begin with arbitrary power, but that this is the\ndepravation, the extreme term, of government, and brings it back, finally, to just the law of the strongest,\nwhich it was originally designed to remedy. Supposing, however, it had begun in this manner, such\npower, being in itself illegitimate, could not have served as a basis for the laws of society, nor,\nconsequently, for the inequality they instituted.\nWithout entering at present upon the investigations which still remain to be made into the nature\nof the fundamental compact underlying all government, I content myself with adopting the common\nopinion concerning it, and regard the establishment of the political body as a real contract between the\npeople and the chiefs chosen by them: a contract by which both parties bind themselves to observe the\nlaws therein expressed, which form the ties of their union. The people having in respect of their social\nrelations concentrated all their wills in one, the several articles, concerning which this will is explained,\nbecome so many fundamental laws, obligatory on all the members of the State without exception, and one\nof these articles regulates the choice and power of the magistrates appointed to watch over the execution\nof the rest. This power extends to everything which may maintain the constitution, without going so far as\nto alter it. It is accompanied by honours, in order to bring the laws and their administrators into respect.\nThe ministers are also distinguished by personal prerogatives, in order to recompense them for the cares\nand labour which good administration involves. The magistrate, on his side, binds himself to use the\npower he is entrusted with only in conformity with the intention of his constituents, to maintain them all\nin the peaceable possession of what belongs to them, and to prefer on every occasion the public interest to\nhis own.\n\nBefore experience had shown, or knowledge of the human heart enabled men to foresee, the\nunavoidable abuses of such a constitution, it must have appeared so much the more excellent, as those\nwho were charged with the care of its preservation had themselves most interest in it; for magistracy and\nthe rights attaching to it being based solely on the fundamental laws, the magistrates would cease to be\nlegitimate as soon as these ceased to exist; the people would no longer owe them obedience; and as not\nthe magistrates, but the laws, are essential to the being of a State, the members of it would regain the right\nto their natural liberty.\nIf we reflect with ever so little attention on this subject, we shall find new arguments to confirm\nthis truth, and be convinced from the very nature of the contract that it cannot be irrevocable: for, if there\nwere no superior power capable of ensuring the fidelity of the contracting parties, or compelling them to\nperform their reciprocal engagements, the parties would be sole judges in their own cause, and each\nwould always have a right to renounce the contract, as soon as he found that the other had violated its\nterms, or that they no longer suited his convenience. It is upon this principle that the right of abdication\nmay possibly be founded. Now, if, as here, we consider only what is human in this institution, it is certain\nthat, if the magistrate, who has all the power in his own hands, and appropriates to himself all the\nadvantages of the contract, has none the less a right to renounce his authority, the people, who suffer for\nall the faults of their chief, must have a much better right to renounce their dependence. But the terrible\nand innumerable quarrels and disorders that would necessarily arise from so dangerous a privilege, show,\nmore than anything else, how much human government stood in need of a more solid basis than mere\nreason, and how expedient it was for the public tranquillity that the divine will should interpose to invest\nthe sovereign authority with a sacred and inviolable character, which might deprive subjects of the fatal\nright of disposing of it. If the world had received no other advantages from religion, this would be enough\nto impose on men the duty of adopting and cultivating it, abuses and all, since it has been the means of\nsaving more blood than fanaticism has ever spilt. But let us follow the thread of our hypothesis.\nThe different forms of government owe their origin to the differing degrees of inequality which\nexisted between individuals at the time of their institution. If there happened to be any one man among\nthem pre-eminent in power, virtue, riches or personal influence, he became sole magistrate, and the State\nassumed the form of monarchy. If several, nearly equal in point of eminence, stood above the rest, they\nwere elected jointly, and formed an aristocracy. Again, among a people who had deviated less from a\nstate of nature, and between whose fortune or talents there was less disproportion, the supreme\nadministration was retained in common, and a democracy was formed. It was discovered in process of\ntime which of these forms suited men the best. Some peoples remained altogether subject to the laws;\nothers soon came to obey their magistrates. The citizens laboured to preserve their liberty; the subjects,\nirritated at seeing others enjoying a blessing they had lost, thought only of making slaves of their\nneighbours. In a word, on the one side arose riches and conquests, and on the other happiness and virtue.\nIn these different governments, all the offices were at first elective; and when the influence of\nwealth was out of the question, the preference was given to merit, which gives a natural ascendancy, and\nto age, which is experienced in business and deliberate in council. The Elders of the Hebrews, the\nGerontes at Sparta, the Senate at Rome, and the very etymology of our word Seigneur, show how old age\nwas once held in veneration. But the more often the choice fell upon old men, the more often elections\nhad to be repeated, and the more they became a nuisance; intrigues set in, factions were formed, party\nfeeling grew bitter, civil wars broke out; the lives of individuals were sacrificed to the pretended\nhappiness of the State; and at length men were on the point of relapsing into their primitive anarchy.\nAmbitious chiefs profited by these circumstances to perpetuate their offices in their own families: at the\nsame time the people, already used to dependence, ease, and the conveniences of life, and already\nincapable of breaking its fetters, agreed to an increase of its slavery, in order to secure its tranquillity.\nThus magistrates, having become hereditary, contracted the habit of considering their offices as a family\nestate, and themselves as proprietors of the communities of which they were at first only the officers, of\n\nregarding their fellow-citizens as their slaves, and numbering them, like cattle, among their belongings,\nand of calling themselves the equals of the gods and kings of kings.\nIf we follow the progress of inequality in these various revolutions, we shall find that the\nestablishment of laws and of the right of property was its first term, the institution of magistracy the\nsecond, and the conversion of legitimate into arbitrary power the third and last; so that the condition of\nrich and poor was authorised by the first period; that of powerful and weak by the second; and only by the\nthird that of master and slave, which is the last degree of inequality, and the term at which all the rest\nremain, when they have got so far, till the government is either entirely dissolved by new revolutions, or\nbrought back again to legitimacy.\nTo understand this progress as necessary we must consider not so much the motives for the\nestablishment of the body politic, as the forms it assumes in actuality, and the faults that necessarily\nattend it: for the flaws which make social institutions necessary are the same as make the abuse of them\nunavoidable. If we except Sparta, where the laws were mainly concerned with the education of children,\nand where Lycurgus established such morality as practically made laws needles C for laws as a rule, being\nweaker than the passions, restrain men without altering them C it would not be difficult to prove that\nevery government, which scrupulously complied with the ends for which it was instituted, and guarded\ncarefully against change and corruption, was set up unnecessarily. For a country, in which no one either\nevaded the laws or made a bad use of magisterial power, could require neither laws nor magistrates.\nPolitical distinctions necessarily produce civil distinctions. The growing equality between the\nchiefs and the people is soon felt by individuals, and modified in a thousand ways according to passions,\ntalents and circumstances. The magistrate could not usurp any illegitimate power, without giving\ndistinction to the creatures with whom he must share it. Besides, individuals only allow themselves to be\noppressed so far as they are hurried on by blind ambition, and, looking rather below than above them,\ncome to love authority more than independence, and submit to slavery, that they may in turn enslave\nothers. It is no easy matter to reduce to obedience a man who has no ambition to command; nor would the\nmost adroit politician find it possible to enslave a people whose only desire was to be independent. But\ninequality easily makes its way among cowardly and ambitious minds, which are ever ready to run the\nrisks of fortune, and almost indifferent whether they command or obey, as it is favourable or adverse.\nThus, there must have been a time, when the eyes of the people were so fascinated, that their rules had\nonly to say to the least of men, \"Be great, you and all your posterity,\" to make him immediately appear\ngreat in the eyes of every one as well as in his own. His descendants took still more upon them, in\nproportion to their distance from him; the more obscure and uncertain the cause, the greater the effect: the\ngreater the number of idlers one could count in a family, the more illustrious it was held to be.\nIf this were the place to go into details, I could readily explain how, even without the intervention\nof government, inequality of credit and authority became unavoidable among private persons, as soon as\ntheir union in a single society made them compare themselves one with another, and take into account the\ndifferences which they found out from the continual intercourse every man had to have with his\nneighbours.6 These differences are of several kinds; but riches, nobility or rank, power and personal merit\n6Distributive justice would oppose this rigorous equality of the state of nature, even were it\npracticable in civil society; as all the members of the State owe it their services in proportion to their\ntalents and abilities, they ought, on their side, to be distinguished and favoured in proportion to the\nservices they have actually rendered. It is in this sense we must understand that passage of Isocrates, in\nwhich he extols the primitive Athenians, for having determined which of the two kinds of equality was\nthe most useful, viz., that which consists in dividing the same advantages indiscriminately among all the\ncitizens, or that which consists in distributing them to each according to his deserts. These able\npoliticians, adds the orator, banishing that unjust inequality which makes no distinction between good and\n\nbeing the principal distinctions by which men form an estimate of each other in society, I could prove that\nthe harmony or conflict of these different forces is the surest indication of the good or bad constitution of\na State. I could show that among these four kinds of inequality, personal qualities being the origin of all\nthe others, wealth is the one to which they are all reduced in the end; for, as riches tend most immediately\nto the prosperity of individuals, and are easiest to communicate, they are used to purchase every other\ndistinction. By this observation we are enabled to judge pretty exactly how far a people has departed from\nits primitive constitution, and of its progress towards the extreme term of corruption. I could explain how\nmuch this universal desire for reputation, honours and advancement, which inflames us all, exercises and\nholds up to comparison our faculties and powers; how it excites and multiplies our passions, and, by\ncreating universal competition and rivalry, or rather enmity, among men, occasions numberless failures,\nsuccesses and disturbances of all kinds by making so many aspirants run the same course. I could show\nthat it is to this desire of being talked about, and this unremitting rage of distinguishing ourselves, that we\nowe the best and the worst things we possess, both our virtues and our vices, our science and our errors,\nour conquerors and our philosophers; that is to say, a great many bad things, and a very few good ones. In\na word, I could prove that, if we have a few rich and powerful men on the pinnacle of fortune and\ngrandeur, while the crowd grovels in want and obscurity, it is because the former prize what they enjoy\nonly in so far as others are destitute of it; and because, without changing their condition, they would cease\nto be happy the moment the people ceased to be wretched.\nbad men, adhered inviolably to that which rewards and punishes every man according to his deserts.\nBut in the first place, there never existed a society, however corrupt some may have become,\nwhere no difference was made between the good and the bad; and with regard to morality, where no\nmeasures can be prescribed by law exact enough to serve as a practical rule for a magistrate, it is with\ngreat prudence that, in order not to leave the fortune or quality of the citizens to his discretion, it prohibits\nhim from passing judgment on persons and confines his judgment to actions. Only morals such as those\nof the ancient Romans can bear censors, and such a tribunal among us would throw everything into\nconfusion. The difference between good and bad men is determined by public esteem; the magistrate\nbeing strictly a judge of right alone; whereas the public is the truest judge of morals, and is of such\nintegrity and penetration on this head, that although it may be sometimes deceived, it can never be\ncorrupted. The rank of citizens ought, therefore, to be regulated, not according to their personal merit C\nfor this would put it in the power of the magistrate to apply the law almost arbitrarily C but according to\nthe actual services done to the State, which are capable of being more exactly estimated.\n\nThese details alone, however, would furnish matter for a considerable work, in which the\nadvantages and disadvantages of every kind of government might be weighed, as they are related to man\nin the state of nature, and at the same time all the different aspects, under which inequality has up to the\npresent appeared, or may appear in ages yet to come, according to the nature of the several governments,\nand the alterations which time must unavoidably occasion in them, might be demonstrated. We should\nthen see the multitude oppressed from within, in consequence of the very precautions it had taken to\nguard against foreign tyranny. We should see oppression continually gain ground without it being\npossible for the oppressed to know where it would stop, or what legitimate means was left them of\nchecking its progress. We should see the rights of citizens, and the freedom of nations slowly\nextinguished, and the complaints, protests and appeals of the weak treated as seditious murmurings. We\nshould see the honour of defending the common cause confined by statecraft to a mercenary part of the\npeople. We should see taxes made necessary by such means, and the disheartened husbandman deserting\nhis fields even in the midst of peace, and leaving the plough to gird on the sword. We should see fatal and\ncapricious codes of honour established; and the champions of their country sooner or later becoming its\nenemies, and for ever holding their daggers to the breasts of their fellow-citizens. The time would come\nwhen they would be heard saying to the oppressor of their country C\nIf you order me to plunge my sword into my brother=s breast and my\nfather=s throat and into the vitals of my pregnant wife, I shall do it, even\nthough my hand is unwilling.\nLucan, Pharsalia, i. 376\nFrom great inequality of fortunes and conditions, from the vast variety of passions and of talents,\nof useless and pernicious arts, of vain sciences, would arise a multitude of prejudices equally contrary to\nreason, happiness and virtue. We should see the magistrates fomenting everything that might weaken men\nunited in society, by promoting dissension among them; everything that might sow in it the seeds of\nactual division, while it gave society the air of harmony; everything that might inspire the different ranks\nof people with mutual hatred and distrust, by setting the rights and interests of one against those of\nanother, and so strengthen the power which comprehended them all.\nIt is from the midst of this disorder and these revolutions, that despotism, gradually raising up its\nhideous head and devouring everything that remained sound and untainted in any part of the State, would\nat length trample on both the laws and the people, and establish itself on the ruins of the republic. The\ntimes which immediately preceded this last change would be times of trouble and calamity; but at length\nthe monster would swallow up everything, and the people would no longer have either chiefs or laws, but\nonly tyrants. From this moment there would be no question of virtue or morality; for despotism cui ex\nhonesto nulla est spes, wherever it prevails, admits no other master; it no sooner speaks than probity and\nduty lose their weight and blind obedience is the only virtue which slaves can still practise.\nThis is the last term of inequality, the extreme point that closes the circle, and meets that from\nwhich we set out. Here all private persons return to their first equality, because they are nothing; and,\nsubjects having no law but the will of their master, and their master no restraint but his passions, all\nnotions of good and all principles of equity again vanish. There is here a complete return to the law of the\nstrongest, and so to a new state of nature, differing from that we set out from; for the one was a state of\nnature in its first purity, while this is the consequence of excessive corruption. There is so little difference\nbetween the two states in other respects, and the contract of government is so completely dissolved by\ndespotism, that the despot is master only so long as he remains the strongest; as soon as he can be\nexpelled, he has no right to complain of violence. The popular insurrection that ends in the death or\ndeposition of a Sultan is as lawful an act as those by which he disposed, the day before, of the lives and\nfortunes of his subjects. As he was maintained by force alone, it is force alone that overthrows him. Thus\neverything takes place according to the natural order; and, whatever may be the result of such frequent\n\nand precipitate revolutions, no one man has reason to complain of the injustice of another, but only of his\nown ill-fortune or indiscretion.\nIf the reader thus discovers and retraces the lost and forgotten road, by which man must have\npassed from the state of nature to the state of society; if he carefully restores, along with the intermediate\nsituations which I have just described, those which want of time has compelled me to suppress, or my\nimagination has failed to suggest, he cannot fail to be struck by the vast distance which separates the two\nstates. It is in tracing this slow succession that he will find the solution of a number of problems of\npolitics and morals, which philosophers cannot settle. He will feel that, men being different in different\nages, the reason why Diogenes could not find a man was that he sought among his contemporaries a man\nof an earlier period. He will see that Cato died with Rome and liberty, because he did not fit the age in\nwhich he lived; the greatest of men served only to astonish a world which he would certainly have ruled,\nhad he lived five hundred years sooner. In a word, he will explain how the soul and the passions of men\ninsensibly change their very nature; why our wants and pleasures in the end seek new objects; and why,\nthe original man having vanished by degrees, society offers to us only an assembly of artificial men and\nfactitious passions, which are the work of all these new relations, and without any real foundation in\nnature. We are taught nothing on this subject, by reflection, that is not entirely confirmed by observation.\nThe savage and the civilised man differ so much in the bottom of their hearts and in their inclinations, that\nwhat constitutes the supreme happiness of one would reduce the other to despair. The former breathes\nonly peace and liberty; he desires only to live and be free from labour; even the ataraxia of the Stoic falls\nfar short of his profound indifference to every other object. Civilised man, on the other hand, is always\nmoving, sweating, toiling and racking his brains to find still more laborious occupations: he goes on in\ndrudgery to his last moment, and even seeks death to put himself in a position to live, or renounces life to\nacquire immortality. He pays his court to men in power, whom he hates, and to the wealthy, whom he\ndespises; he stops at nothing to have the honour of serving them; he is not ashamed to value himself on\nhis own meanness and their protection; and, proud of his slavery, he speaks with disdain of those, who\nhave not the honour of sharing it. What a sight would the perplexing and envied labours of a European\nminister of State present to the eyes of a Caribbean! How many cruel deaths would not this indolent\nsavage prefer to the horrors of such a life, which is seldom even sweetened by the pleasure of doing good!\nBut, for him to see into the motives of all this solicitude, the words power and reputation, would have to\nbear some meaning in his mind; he would have to know that there are men who set a value on the opinion\nof the rest of the world; who can be made happy and satisfied with themselves rather on the testimony of\nother people than on their own. In reality, the source of all these differences is, that the savage lives\nwithin himself, while social man lives constantly outside himself, and only knows how to live in the\nopinion of others, so that he seems to receive the consciousness of his own existence merely from the\njudgment of others concerning him. It is not to my present purpose to insist on the indifference to good\nand evil which arises from this disposition, in spite of our many fine works on morality, or to show how,\neverything being reduced to appearances, there is but art and mummery in even honour, friendship, virtue,\nand often vice itself, of which we at length learn the secret of boasting; to show, in short, how, always\nasking others what we are, and never daring to ask ourselves, in the midst of so much philosophy,\nhumanity and civilisation, and of such sublime codes of morality, we have nothing to show for ourselves\nbut a frivolous and deceitful appearance, honour without virtue, reason without wisdom, and pleasure\nwithout happiness. It is sufficient that I have proved that this is not by any means the original state of\nman, but that it is merely the spirit of society, and the inequality which society produces, that thus\ntransform and alter all our natural inclinations.\nI have endeavoured to trace the origin and progress of inequality, and the institution and abuse of\npolitical societies, as far as these are capable of being deduced from the nature of man merely by the light\nof reason, and independently of those sacred dogmas which give the sanction of divine right to sovereign\nauthority. It follows from this survey that, as there is hardly any inequality in the state of nature, all the\ninequality which now prevails owes its strength and growth to the development of our faculties and the\nadvance of the human mind, and becomes at last permanent and legitimate by the establishment of\n\nproperty and laws. Secondly, it follows that moral inequality, authorised by positive right alone, clashes\nwith natural right, whenever it is not proportionate to physical inequality; a distinction which sufficiently\ndetermines what we ought to think of that species of inequality which prevails in all civilised, countries;\nsince it is plainly contrary to the law of nature, however defined, that children should command old men,\nfools wise men, and that the privileged few should gorge themselves with superfluities, while the starving\nmultitude are in want of the bare necessities of life.\nAPPENDIX\nA FAMOUS author, reckoning up the good and evil of human life, and comparing the aggregates,\nfinds that our pains greatly exceed our pleasures: so that, all things considered, human life is not at all a\nvaluable gift. This conclusion does not surprise me; for the writer drew all his arguments from man in\ncivilisation. Had he gone back to the state of nature, his inquiries would clearly have had a different\nresult, and man would have been seen to be subject to very few evils not of his own creation. It has indeed\ncost us not a little trouble to make ourselves as wretched as we are. When we consider, on the one hand,\nthe immense labours of mankind, the many sciences brought to perfection, the arts invented, the powers\nemployed, the deeps filled up, the mountains levelled, the rocks shattered, the rivers made navigable, the\ntracts of land cleared, the lakes emptied, the marshes drained, the enormous structures erected on land,\nand the teeming vessels that cover the sea; and, on the other hand, estimate with ever so little thought, the\nreal advantages that have accrued from all these works to mankind, we cannot help being amazed at the\nvast disproportion there is between these things, and deploring the infatuation of man, which, to gratify\nhis silly pride and vain self-admiration, induces him eagerly to pursue all the miseries he is capable of\nfeeling, though beneficent nature had kindly placed them out of his way.\nThat men are actually wicked, a sad and continual experience of them proves beyond doubt: but,\nall the same, I think I have shown that man is naturally good. What then can have depraved him to such\nan extent, except the changes that have happened in his constitution, the advances he has made, and the\nknowledge he has acquired? We may admire human society as much as we please; it will be none the less\ntrue that it necessarily leads men to hate each other in proportion as their interests clash, and to do one\nanother apparent services, while they are really doing every imaginable mischief. What can be thought of\na relation, in which the interest of every individual dictates rules directly opposite to those the public\nreason dictates to the community in general C in which every man finds his profit in the misfortunes of\nhis neighbour? There is not perhaps any man in a comfortable position who has not greedy heirs, and\nperhaps even children, secretly wishing for his death; not a ship at sea, of which the loss would not be\ngood news to some merchant or other; not a house, which some debtor of bad faith would not be glad to\nsee reduced to ashes with all the papers it contains; not a nation which does not rejoice at the disasters that\nbefall its neighbours. Thus it is that we find our advantage in the misfortunes of our fellow-creatures, and\nthat the loss of one man almost always constitutes the prosperity of another. But it is still more pernicious\nthat public calamities are the objects of the hopes and expectations of innumerable individuals. Some\ndesire sickness, some mortality, some war, and some famine. I have seen men wicked enough to weep for\nsorrow at the prospect of a plentiful season; and the great and fatal fire of London, which cost so many\nunhappy persons their lives or their fortunes, made the fortunes of perhaps ten thousand others. I know\nthat Montaigne censures Demades the Athenian for having caused to be punished a workman who, by\nselling his coffins very dear, was a great gainer by the deaths of his fellow-citizens; but, the reason\nalleged by Montaigne being that everybody ought to be punished, my point is clearly confirmed by it. Let\nus penetrate, therefore, the superficial appearances of benevolence, and survey what passes in the inmost\nrecesses of the heart. Let us reflect what must be the state of things, when men are forced to caress and\ndestroy one another at the same time; when they are born enemies by duty, and knaves by interest. It will\nperhaps be said that society is so formed that every man gains by serving the rest. That would be all very\nwell, if he did not gain still more by injuring them. There is no legitimate profit so great, that it cannot be\n\ngreatly exceeded by what may be made illegitimately; we always gain more by hurting our neighbours\nthan by doing them good. Nothing is required but to know how to act with impunity; and to this end the\npowerful employ all their strength, and the weak all their cunning.\nSavage man, when he has dined, is at peace with all nature, and the friend of all his\nfellow-creatures. If a dispute arises about a meal, he rarely comes to blows, without having first compared\nthe difficulty of conquering his antagonist with the trouble of finding subsistence elsewhere: and, as pride\ndoes not come in, it all ends in a few blows; the victor eats, and the vanquished seeks provision\nsomewhere else, and all is at peace. The case is quite different with man in the state of society, for whom\nfirst necessaries have to be provided, and then superfluities; delicacies follow next, then immense wealth,\nthen subjects, and then slaves. He enjoys not a moment's relaxation; and what is yet stranger, the less\nnatural and pressing his wants, the more headstrong are his passions, and, still worse, the more he has it in\nhis power to gratify them; so that after a long course of prosperity, after having swallowed up treasures\nand ruined multitudes, the hero ends up by cutting every throat till he finds himself, at last, sole master of\nthe world. Such is in miniature the moral picture, if not of human life, at least of the secret pretensions of\nthe heart of civilised man.\nCompare without partiality the state of the citizen with that of the savage, and trace out, if you\ncan, how many inlets the former has opened to pain and death, besides those of his vices, his wants and\nhis misfortunes. If you reflect on the mental afflictions that prey on us, the violent passions that waste and\nexhaust us, the excessive labour with which the poor are burdened, the still more dangerous indolence to\nwhich the wealthy give themselves up, so that the poor perish of want, and the rich of surfeit; if you\nreflect but a moment on the heterogeneous mixtures and pernicious seasonings of foods; the corrupt state\nin which they are frequently eaten; on the adulteration of medicines, the wiles of those who sell them, the\nmistakes of those who administer them, and the poisonous vessels in which they are prepared; on the\nepidemics bred by foul air in consequence of great numbers of men being crowded together, or those\nwhich are caused by our delicate way of living, by our passing from our houses into the open air and back\nagain, by the putting on or throwing off our clothes with too little care, and by all the precautions which\nsensuality has converted into necessary habits, and the neglect of which sometimes costs us our life or\nhealth; if you take into account the conflagrations and earthquakes, which, devouring or overwhelming\nwhole cities, destroy the inhabitants by thousands; in a word, if you add together all the dangers with\nwhich these causes are always threatening us, you will see how dearly nature makes us pay for the\ncontempt with which we have treated her lessons.\nI shall not here repeat, what I have elsewhere said of the calamities of war; but wish that those,\nwho have sufficient knowledge, were willing or bold enough to make public the details of the villainies\ncommitted in armies by the contractors for commissariat and hospitals: we should see plainly that their\nmonstrous frauds, already none too well concealed, which cripple the finest armies in less than no time,\noccasion greater destruction among the soldiers than the swords of the enemy.\nThe number of people who perish annually at sea, by famine, the scurvy, pirates, fire and\nshipwrecks, affords matter for another shocking calculation. We must also place to the credit of the\nestablishment of property, and consequently to the institution of society, assassinations, poisonings,\nhighway robberies, and even the punishments inflicted on the wretches guilty of these crimes; which,\nthough expedient to prevent greater evils, yet by making the murder of one man cost the lives of two or\nmore, double the loss to the human race.\nWhat shameful methods are sometimes practised to prevent the birth of men, and cheat nature;\neither by brutal and depraved appetites which insult her most beautiful work-appetites unknown to\nsavages or mere animals, which can spring only from the corrupt imagination of mankind in civilised\ncountries; or by secret abortions, the fitting effects of debauchery and vitiated notions of honour; or by the\n\nexposure or murder of multitudes of infants, who fall victims to the poverty of their parents, or the cruel\nshame of their mothers; or, finally, by the mutilation of unhappy wretches, part of whose life, with their\nhope of posterity, is given up to vain singing, or, still worse, the brutal jealousy of other men: a mutilation\nwhich, in the last case, becomes a double outrage against nature from the treatment of those who suffer it,\nand from the use to which they are destined. But is it not a thousand times more common and more\ndangerous for paternal rights openly to offend against humanity? How many talents have not been thrown\naway, and inclinations forced, by the unwise constraint of fathers? How many men, who would have\ndistinguished themselves in a fitting estate, have died dishonoured and wretched in another for which they\nhad no taste! How many happy, but unequal, marriages have been broken or disturbed, and how many\nchaste wives have been dishonoured, by an order of things continually in contradiction with that of\nnature! How many good and virtuous husbands and wives are reciprocally punished for having been\nill-assorted! How many young and unhappy victims of their parents' avarice plunge into vice, or pass their\nmelancholy days in tears, groaning in the indissoluble bonds which their hearts repudiate and gold alone\nhas formed! Fortunate sometimes are those whose courage and virtue remove them from life before\ninhuman violence makes them spend it in crime or in despair. Forgive me, father and mother, whom I\nshall ever regret: my complaint embitters your griefs; but would they might be an eternal and terrible\nexample to every one who dares, in the name of nature, to violate her most sacred right.\nIf I have spoken only of those ill-starred unions which are the result of our system, is it to be\nthought that those over which love and sympathy preside are free from disadvantages? What if I should\nundertake to show humanity attacked in its very source, and even in the most sacred of all ties, in which\nfortune is consulted before nature, and, the disorders of society confounding all virtue and vice,\ncontinence becomes a criminal precaution, and a refusal to give life to a fellow-creature, an act of\nhumanity? But, without drawing aside the veil which hides all these horrors, let us content ourselves with\npointing out the evil which others will have to remedy.\nTo all this add the multiplicity of unhealthy trades, which shorten men's lives or destroy their\nbodies, such as working in the mines, and the preparing of metals and minerals, particularly lead, copper,\nmercury, cobalt, and arsenic: add those other dangerous trades which are daily fatal to many tilers,\ncarpenters, masons and miners: put all these together and we can see, in the establishment and perfection\nof societies, the reasons for that diminution of our species, which has been noticed by many philosophers.\nLuxury, which cannot be prevented among men who are tenacious of their own convenience and\nof the respect paid them by others, soon completes the evil society had begun, and, under the pretence of\ngiving bread to the poor, whom it should never have made such, impoverishes all the rest, and sooner or\nlater depopulates the State. Luxury is a remedy much worse than the disease it sets up to cure; or rather it\nis in itself the greatest of all evils, for every State, great or small: for, in order to maintain all the servants\nand vagabonds it creates, it brings oppression and ruin on the citizen and the labourer; it is like those\nscorching winds, which, covering the trees and plants with devouring insects, deprive useful animals of\ntheir subsistence and spread famine and death wherever they blow.\nFrom society and the luxury to which it gives birth arise the liberal and mechanical arts,\ncommerce, letters, and all those superfluities which make industry flourish, and enrich and ruin nations.\nThe reason for such destruction is plain. It is easy to see, from the very nature of agriculture, that it must\nbe the least lucrative of all the arts; for, its produce being the most universally necessary, the price must\nbe proportionate to the abilities of the very poorest of mankind.\nFrom the same principle may be deduced this rule, that the arts in general are more lucrative in\nproportion as they are less useful; and that, in the end, the most useful becomes the most neglected. From\nthis we may learn what to think of the real advantages of industry and the actual effects of its progress.\n\nSuch are the sensible causes of all the miseries, into which opulence at length plunges the most\ncelebrated nations. In proportion as arts and industry flourish, the despised husbandman, burdened with\nthe taxes necessary for the support of luxury, and condemned to pass his days between labour and hunger,\nforsakes his native field, to seek in towns the bread he ought to carry thither. The more our capital cities\nstrike the vulgar eye with admiration, the greater reason is there to lament the sight of the abandoned\ncountryside, the large tracts of land that lie uncultivated, the roads crowded with unfortunate citizens\nturned beggars or highwaymen, and doomed to end their wretched lives either on a dunghill or on the\ngallows. Thus the State grows rich on the one hand, and feeble and depopulated on the other; the\nmightiest monarchies, after having taken immense pains to enrich and depopulate themselves, fall at last a\nprey to some poor nation, which has yielded to the fatal temptation of invading them, and then, growing\nopulent and weak in its turn, is itself invaded and ruined by some other.\nLet any one inform us what produced the swarms of barbarians, who overran Europe, Asia and\nAfrica for so many ages. Was their prodigious increase due to their industry and arts, to the wisdom of\ntheir laws, or to the excellence of their political system? Let the learned tell us why, instead of\nmultiplying to such a degree, these fierce and brutal men, without sense or science, without education,\nwithout restraint, did not destroy each other hourly in quarrelling over the productions of their fields and\nwoods. Let them tell us how these wretches could have the presumption to oppose such clever people as\nwe were, so well trained in military discipline, and possessed of such excellent laws and institutions: and\nwhy, since society has been brought to perfection in northern countries, and so much pains taken to\ninstruct their inhabitants in their social duties and in the art of living happily and peaceably together, we\nsee them no longer produce such numberless hosts as they used once to send forth to be the plague and\nterror of other nations. I fear some one may at last answer me by saying, that all these fine things, arts,\nsciences and laws, were wisely invented by men, as a salutary plague, to prevent the too great\nmultiplication of mankind, lest the world, which was given us for a habitation, should in time be too small\nfor its inhabitants.\n\nWhat, then, is to be done? Must societies be totally abolished? Must meum and tuum be\nannihilated, and must we return again to the forests to live among bears? This is a deduction in\nthe manner of my adversaries, which I would as soon anticipate as let them have the shame of\ndrawing. O you, who have never heard the voice of heaven, who think man destined only to live\nthis little life and die in peace; you, who can resign in the midst of populous cities your fatal\nacquisitions, your restless spirits, your corrupt hearts and endless desires; resume, since it\ndepends entirely on ourselves, your ancient and primitive innocence: retire to the woods, there to\nlose the sight and remembrance of the crimes of your contemporaries; and be not apprehensive of\ndegrading your species, by renouncing its advances in order to renounce its vices. As for men like\nme, whose passions have destroyed their original simplicity, who can no longer subsist on plants\nor acorns, or live without laws and magistrates; those who were honoured in their first father with\nsupernatural instructions; those who discover, in the design of giving human actions at the start a\nmorality which they must otherwise have been so long in acquiring, the reason for a precept in\nitself indifferent and inexplicable on every other system; those, in short, who are persuaded that\nthe Divine Being has called all mankind to be partakers in the happiness and perfection of\ncelestial intelligences, all these will endeavour to merit the eternal prize they are to expect from\nthe practice of those virtues, which they make themselves follow in learning to know them. They\nwill respect the sacred bonds of their respective communities; they will love their fellow-citizens,\nand serve them with all their might: they will scrupulously obey the laws, and all those who make\nor administer them; they will particularly honour those wise and good princes, who find means of\npreventing, curing or even palliating all these evils and abuses, by which we are constantly\nthreatened; they will animate the zeal of their deserving rulers, by showing them, without flattery\nor fear, the importance of their office and the severity of their duty. But they will not therefore\nhave less contempt for a constitution that cannot support itself without the aid of so many\nsplendid characters, much oftener wished for than found; and from which, notwithstanding all\ntheir pains and solicitude, there always arise more real calamities than even apparent advantages."

Texts: Public domain.\nWILLIAM WORDSWORTH (1770-1850)\nLINES\nComposed a Few Miles above Tintern Abbey on\nRevisiting the Wye During a Tour. July 13, 1798\nFive years have past; five summers, with the length\nOf five long winters! and again I hear\nThese waters, rolling from their mountain-springs\nWith a soft inland murmur.--Once again\nDo I behold these steep and lofty cliffs,\nThat on a wild secluded scene impress\nThoughts of more deep seclusion; and connect\nThe landscape with the quiet of the sky.\nThe day is come when I again repose\nHere, under this dark sycamore, and view\nThese plots of cottage-ground, these orchard-tufts,\nWhich at this season, with their unripe fruits,\nAre clad in one green hue, and lose themselves\n'Mid groves and copses. Once again I see\nThese hedge-rows, hardly hedge-rows, little lines\nOf sportive wood run wild: these pastoral farms,\nGreen to the very door; and wreaths of smoke\nSent up, in silence, from among the trees!\nWith some uncertain notice, as might seem\nOf vagrant dwellers in the houseless woods,\nOr of some Hermit's cave, where by his fire\nThe Hermit sits alone.\nThese beauteous forms,\nThrough a long absence, have not been to me\nAs is a landscape to a blind man's eye:\nBut oft, in lonely rooms, and 'mid the din\nOf towns and cities, I have owed to them\nIn hours of weariness, sensations sweet,\nFelt in the blood, and felt along the heart;\nAnd passing even into my purer mind,\nWith tranquil restoration:--feelings too\nOf unremembered pleasure: such, perhaps,\n\nAs have no slight or trivial influence\nOn that best portion of a good man's life,\nHis little, nameless, unremembered, acts\nOf kindness and of love. Nor less, I trust,\nTo them I may have owed another gift,\nOf aspect more sublime; that blessed mood,\nIn which the burthen of the mystery,\nIn which the heavy and the weary weight\nOf all this unintelligible world,\nIs lightened:--that serene and blessed mood,\nIn which the affections gently lead us on,--\nUntil, the breath of this corporeal frame\nAnd even the motion of our human blood\nAlmost suspended, we are laid asleep\nIn body, and become a living soul:\nWhile with an eye made quiet by the power\nOf harmony, and the deep power of joy,\nWe see into the life of things.\nIf this\nBe but a vain belief, yet, oh! how oft-\nIn darkness and amid the many shapes\nOf joyless daylight; when the fretful stir\nUnprofitable, and the fever of the world,\nHave hung upon the beatings of my heart-\nHow oft, in spirit, have I turned to thee,\nO sylvan Wye! thou wanderer thro' the woods,\nHow often has my spirit turned to thee!\nAnd now, with gleams of half-extinguished thought,\nWith many recognitions dim and faint,\nAnd somewhat of a sad perplexity,\nThe picture of the mind revives again:\nWhile here I stand, not only with the sense\nOf present pleasure, but with pleasing thoughts\nThat in this moment there is life and food\nFor future years. And so I dare to hope,\nThough changed, no doubt, from what I was when first\nI came among these hills; when like a roe\nI bounded o'er the mountains, by the sides\nOf the deep rivers, and the lonely streams,\nWherever nature led: more like a man\nFlying from something that he dreads, than one\nWho sought the thing he loved. For nature then\n(The coarser pleasures of my boyish days,\nAnd their glad animal movements all gone by)\nTo me was all in all.--I cannot paint\nWhat then I was. The sounding cataract\nHaunted me like a passion: the tall rock,\nThe mountain, and the deep and gloomy wood,\nTheir colours and their forms, were then to me\n\nAn appetite; a feeling and a love,\nThat had no need of a remoter charm,\nBy thought supplied, nor any interest\nUnborrowed from the eye.--That time is past,\nAnd all its aching joys are now no more,\nAnd all its dizzy raptures. Not for this\nFaint I, nor mourn nor murmur, other gifts\nHave followed; for such loss, I would believe,\nAbundant recompense. For I have learned\nTo look on nature, not as in the hour\nOf thoughtless youth; but hearing oftentimes\nThe still, sad music of humanity,\nNor harsh nor grating, though of ample power\nTo chasten and subdue. And I have felt\nA presence that disturbs me with the joy\nOf elevated thoughts; a sense sublime\nOf something far more deeply interfused,\nWhose dwelling is the light of setting suns,\nAnd the round ocean and the living air,\nAnd the blue sky, and in the mind of man;\nA motion and a spirit, that impels\nAll thinking things, all objects of all thought,\nAnd rolls through all things. Therefore am I still\nA lover of the meadows and the woods,\nAnd mountains; and of all that we behold\nFrom this green earth; of all the mighty world\nOf eye, and ear,--both what they half create,\nAnd what perceive; well pleased to recognise\nIn nature and the language of the sense,\nThe anchor of my purest thoughts, the nurse,\nThe guide, the guardian of my heart, and soul\nOf all my moral being.\nNor perchance,\nIf I were not thus taught, should I the more\nSuffer my genial spirits to decay:\nFor thou art with me here upon the banks\nOf this fair river; thou my dearest Friend,\nMy dear, dear Friend; and in thy voice I catch\nThe language of my former heart, and read\nMy former pleasures in the shooting lights\nOf thy wild eyes. Oh! yet a little while\nMay I behold in thee what I was once,\nMy dear, dear Sister! and this prayer I make,\nKnowing that Nature never did betray\nThe heart that loved her; 'tis her privilege,\nThrough all the years of this our life, to lead\nFrom joy to joy: for she can so inform\nThe mind that is within us, so impress\nWith quietness and beauty, and so feed\nWith lofty thoughts, that neither evil tongues,\n\nRash judgments, nor the sneers of selfish men,\nNor greetings where no kindness is, nor all\nThe dreary intercourse of daily life,\nShall e'er prevail against us, or disturb\nOur cheerful faith, that all which we behold\nIs full of blessings. Therefore let the moon\nShine on thee in thy solitary walk;\nAnd let the misty mountain-winds be free\nTo blow against thee: and, in after years,\nWhen these wild ecstasies shall be matured\nInto a sober pleasure; when thy mind\nShall be a mansion for all lovely forms,\nThy memory be as a dwelling-place\nFor all sweet sounds and harmonies; oh! then,\nIf solitude, or fear, or pain, or grief,\nShould be thy portion, with what healing thoughts\nOf tender joy wilt thou remember me,\nAnd these my exhortations! Nor, perchance-\nbe where I no more can hear\nThy voice, nor catch from thy wild eyes these gleams\nOf past existence--wilt thou then forget\nThat on the banks of this delightful stream\nWe stood together; and that I, so long\nA worshipper of Nature, hither came\nUnwearied in that service: rather say\nWith warmer love--oh! with far deeper zeal\nOf holier love. Nor wilt thou then forget,\nThat after many wanderings, many years\nOf absence, these steep woods and lofty cliffs,\nAnd this green pastoral landscape, were to me\nMore dear, both for themselves and for thy sake!\nexcerpts from THE PRELUDE; OR THE GROWTH OF A POET=S MIND\nBOOK FIRST\nINTRODUCTION--CHILDHOOD AND SCHOOL-TIME\nOH there is blessing in this gentle breeze,\nA visitant that while it fans my cheek\nDoth seem half-conscious of the joy it brings\nFrom the green fields, and from yon azure sky.\nWhate'er its mission, the soft breeze can come\nTo none more grateful than to me; escaped\nFrom the vast city, where I long had pined\nA discontented sojourner: now free,\nFree as a bird to settle where I will.\nWhat dwelling shall receive me? in what vale\nShall be my harbour? underneath what grove\nShall I take up my home? and what clear stream\n\nShall with its murmur lull me into rest?\nThe earth is all before me. With a heart\nJoyous, nor scared at its own liberty,\nI look about; and should the chosen guide\nBe nothing better than a wandering cloud,\nI cannot miss my way. I breathe again!\nTrances of thought and mountings of the mind\nCome fast upon me: it is shaken off, 20\nThat burthen of my own unnatural self,\nThe heavy weight of many a weary day\nNot mine, and such as were not made for me.\nLong months of peace (if such bold word accord\nWith any promises of human life),\nLong months of ease and undisturbed delight\nAre mine in prospect; whither shall I turn,\nBy road or pathway, or through trackless field,\nUp hill or down, or shall some floating thing\nUpon the river point me out my course? 30\nDear Liberty! Yet what would it avail\nBut for a gift that consecrates the joy?\nFor I, methought, while the sweet breath of heaven\nWas blowing on my body, felt within\nA correspondent breeze, that gently moved\nWith quickening virtue, but is now become\nA tempest, a redundant energy,\nVexing its own creation. Thanks to both,\nAnd their congenial powers, that, while they join\nIn breaking up a long-continued frost, 40\nBring with them vernal promises, the hope\nOf active days urged on by flying hours,--\nDays of sweet leisure, taxed with patient thought\nAbstruse, nor wanting punctual service high,\nMatins and vespers of harmonious verse!\nThus far, O Friend! did I, not used to make\nA present joy the matter of a song,\nPour forth that day my soul in measured strains\nThat would not be forgotten, and are here\nRecorded: to the open fields I told\nA prophecy: poetic numbers came\nSpontaneously to clothe in priestly robe\nA renovated spirit singled out,\nSuch hope was mine, for holy services.\nMy own voice cheered me, and, far more, the mind's\nInternal echo of the imperfect sound;\nTo both I listened, drawing from them both\nA cheerful confidence in things to come.\nContent and not unwilling now to give\nA respite to this passion, I paced on 60\n\nWith brisk and eager steps; and came, at length,\nTo a green shady place, where down I sate\nBeneath a tree, slackening my thoughts by choice\nAnd settling into gentler happiness.\n'Twas autumn, and a clear and placid day,\nWith warmth, as much as needed, from a sun\nTwo hours declined towards the west; a day\nWith silver clouds, and sunshine on the grass,\nAnd in the sheltered and the sheltering grove\nA perfect stillness. Many were the thoughts\nEncouraged and dismissed, till choice was made\nOf a known Vale, whither my feet should turn,\nNor rest till they had reached the very door\nOf the one cottage which methought I saw.\nNo picture of mere memory ever looked\nSo fair; and while upon the fancied scene\nI gazed with growing love, a higher power\nThan Fancy gave assurance of some work\nOf glory there forthwith to be begun,\nPerhaps too there performed. Thus long I mused, 80\nNor e'er lost sight of what I mused upon,\nSave when, amid the stately grove of oaks,\nNow here, now there, an acorn, from its cup\nDislodged, through sere leaves rustled, or at once\nTo the bare earth dropped with a startling sound.\nFrom that soft couch I rose not, till the sun\nHad almost touched the horizon; casting then\nA backward glance upon the curling cloud\nOf city smoke, by distance ruralised;\nKeen as a Truant or a Fugitive,\nBut as a Pilgrim resolute, I took,\nEven with the chance equipment of that hour,\nThe road that pointed toward the chosen Vale.\nIt was a splendid evening, and my soul\nOnce more made trial of her strength, nor lacked\nAeolian visitations; but the harp\nWas soon defrauded, and the banded host\nOf harmony dispersed in straggling sounds,\nAnd lastly utter silence! \"Be it so;\nWhy think of anything but present good?\"\nSo, like a home-bound labourer, I pursued\nMy way beneath the mellowing sun, that shed\nMild influence; nor left in me one wish\nAgain to bend the Sabbath of that time\nTo a servile yoke. What need of many words?\nA pleasant loitering journey, through three days\nContinued, brought me to my hermitage.\nI spare to tell of what ensued, the life\nIn common things--the endless store of things,\nRare, or at least so seeming, every day110\nFound all about me in one neighbourhood--\n\nThe self-congratulation, and, from morn\nTo night, unbroken cheerfulness serene.\nBut speedily an earnest longing rose\nTo brace myself to some determined aim,\nReading or thinking; either to lay up\nNew stores, or rescue from decay the old\nBy timely interference: and therewith\nCame hopes still higher, that with outward life\nI might endue some airy phantasies\nThat had been floating loose about for years,\nAnd to such beings temperately deal forth\nThe many feelings that oppressed my heart.\nThat hope hath been discouraged; welcome light\nDawns from the east, but dawns to disappear\nAnd mock me with a sky that ripens not\nInto a steady morning: if my mind,\nRemembering the bold promise of the past,\nWould gladly grapple with some noble theme,\nVain is her wish; where'er she turns she finds 130\nImpediments from day to day renewed.\nAnd now it would content me to yield up\nThose lofty hopes awhile, for present gifts\nOf humbler industry. But, oh, dear Friend!\nThe Poet, gentle creature as he is,\nHath, like the Lover, his unruly times;\nHis fits when he is neither sick nor well,\nThough no distress be near him but his own\nUnmanageable thoughts: his mind, best pleased\nWhile she as duteous as the mother dove140\nSits brooding, lives not always to that end,\nBut like the innocent bird, hath goadings on\nThat drive her as in trouble through the groves;\nWith me is now such passion, to be blamed\nNo otherwise than as it lasts too long.\nWhen, as becomes a man who would prepare\nFor such an arduous work, I through myself\nMake rigorous inquisition, the report\nIs often cheering; for I neither seem\nTo lack that first great gift, the vital soul, 150\nNor general Truths, which are themselves a sort\nOf Elements and Agents, Under-powers,\nSubordinate helpers of the living mind:\nNor am I naked of external things,\nForms, images, nor numerous other aids\nOf less regard, though won perhaps with toil\nAnd needful to build up a Poet's praise.\nTime, place, and manners do I seek, and these\nAre found in plenteous store, but nowhere such\nAs may be singled out with steady choice;\n\nNo little band of yet remembered names\nWhom I, in perfect confidence, might hope\nTo summon back from lonesome banishment,\nAnd make them dwellers in the hearts of men\nNow living, or to live in future years.\nSometimes the ambitious Power of choice, mistaking\nProud spring-tide swellings for a regular sea,\nWill settle on some British theme, some old\nRomantic tale by Milton left unsung;\nMore often turning to some gentle place170\nWithin the groves of Chivalry, I pipe\nTo shepherd swains, or seated harp in hand,\nAmid reposing knights by a river side\nOr fountain, listen to the grave reports\nOf dire enchantments faced and overcome\nBy the strong mind, and tales of warlike feats,\nWhere spear encountered spear, and sword with sword\nFought, as if conscious of the blazonry\nThat the shield bore, so glorious was the strife;\nWhence inspiration for a song that winds\nThrough ever-changing scenes of votive quest\nWrongs to redress, harmonious tribute paid\nTo patient courage and unblemished truth,\nTo firm devotion, zeal unquenchable,\nAnd Christian meekness hallowing faithful loves.\nSometimes, more sternly moved, I would relate\nHow vanquished Mithridates northward passed,\nAnd, hidden in the cloud of years, became\nOdin, the Father of a race by whom\nPerished the Roman Empire: how the friends\nAnd followers of Sertorius, out of Spain\nFlying, found shelter in the Fortunate Isles,\nAnd left their usages, their arts and laws,\nTo disappear by a slow gradual death,\nTo dwindle and to perish one by one,\nStarved in those narrow bounds: but not the soul\nOf Liberty, which fifteen hundred years\nSurvived, and, when the European came\nWith skill and power that might not be withstood,\nDid, like a pestilence, maintain its hold\nAnd wasted down by glorious death that race\nOf natural heroes: or I would record\nHow, in tyrannic times, some high-souled man,\nUnnamed among the chronicles of kings,\nSuffered in silence for Truth's sake: or tell,\nHow that one Frenchman, through continued force\nOf meditation on the inhuman deeds\nOf those who conquered first the Indian Isles,\nWent single in his ministry across\nThe Ocean; not to comfort the oppressed,\nBut, like a thirsty wind, to roam about\n\nWithering the Oppressor: how Gustavus sought\nHelp at his need in Dalecarlia's mines:\nHow Wallace fought for Scotland; left the name\nOf Wallace to be found, like a wild flower,\nAll over his dear Country; left the deeds\nOf Wallace, like a family of Ghosts,\nTo people the steep rocks and river banks,\nHer natural sanctuaries, with a local soul\nOf independence and stern liberty.\nSometimes it suits me better to invent\nA tale from my own heart, more near akin\nTo my own passions and habitual thoughts;\nSome variegated story, in the main\nLofty, but the unsubstantial structure melts\nBefore the very sun that brightens it,\nMist into air dissolving! Then a wish,\nMy last and favourite aspiration, mounts\nWith yearning toward some philosophic song\nOf Truth that cherishes our daily life;230\nWith meditations passionate from deep\nRecesses in man's heart, immortal verse\nThoughtfully fitted to the Orphean lyre;\nBut from this awful burthen I full soon\nTake refuge and beguile myself with trust\nThat mellower years will bring a riper mind\nAnd clearer insight. Thus my days are past\nIn contradiction; with no skill to part\nVague longing, haply bred by want of power,\nFrom paramount impulse not to be withstood,\nA timorous capacity, from prudence,\nFrom circumspection, infinite delay.\nHumility and modest awe, themselves\nBetray me, serving often for a cloak\nTo a more subtle selfishness; that now\nLocks every function up in blank reserve,\nNow dupes me, trusting to an anxious eye\nThat with intrusive restlessness beats off\nSimplicity and self-presented truth.\nAh! better far than this, to stray about\nVoluptuously through fields and rural walks,\nAnd ask no record of the hours, resigned\nTo vacant musing, unreproved neglect\nOf all things, and deliberate holiday.\nFar better never to have heard the name\nOf zeal and just ambition, than to live\nBaffled and plagued by a mind that every hour\nTurns recreant to her task; takes heart again,\nThen feels immediately some hollow thought\nHang like an interdict upon her hopes. 260\nThis is my lot; for either still I find\nSome imperfection in the chosen theme,\n\nOr see of absolute accomplishment\nMuch wanting, so much wanting, in myself,\nThat I recoil and droop, and seek repose\nIn listlessness from vain perplexity,\nUnprofitably travelling toward the grave,\nLike a false steward who hath much received\nAnd renders nothing back.\nWas it for this\nThat one, the fairest of all rivers, loved\nTo blend his murmurs with my nurse's song,\nAnd, from his alder shades and rocky falls,\nAnd from his fords and shallows, sent a voice\nThat flowed along my dreams? For this, didst thou,\nO Derwent! winding among grassy holms\nWhere I was looking on, a babe in arms,\nMake ceaseless music that composed my thoughts\nTo more than infant softness, giving me\nAmid the fretful dwellings of mankind\nA foretaste, a dim earnest, of the calm280\nThat Nature breathes among the hills and groves.\nWhen he had left the mountains and received\nOn his smooth breast the shadow of those towers\nThat yet survive, a shattered monument\nOf feudal sway, the bright blue river passed\nAlong the margin of our terrace walk;\nA tempting playmate whom we dearly loved.\nOh, many a time have I, a five years' child,\nIn a small mill-race severed from his stream,\nMade one long bathing of a summer's day;\nBasked in the sun, and plunged and basked again\nAlternate, all a summer's day, or scoured\nThe sandy fields, leaping through flowery groves\nOf yellow ragwort; or, when rock and hill,\nThe woods, and distant Skiddaw's lofty height,\nWere bronzed with deepest radiance, stood alone\nBeneath the sky, as if I had been born\nOn Indian plains, and from my mother's hut\nHad run abroad in wantonness, to sport\nA naked savage, in the thunder shower. 300\nFair seed-time had my soul, and I grew up\nFostered alike by beauty and by fear:\nMuch favoured in my birth-place, and no less\nIn that beloved Vale to which erelong\nWe were transplanted;--there were we let loose\nFor sports of wider range. Ere I had told\nTen birth-days, when among the mountain slopes\nFrost, and the breath of frosty wind, had snapped\nThe last autumnal crocus, 'twas my joy\nWith store of springes o'er my shoulder hung\n\nTo range the open heights where woodcocks run\nAlong the smooth green turf. Through half the night,\nScudding away from snare to snare, I plied\nThat anxious visitation;--moon and stars\nWere shining o'er my head. I was alone,\nAnd seemed to be a trouble to the peace\nThat dwelt among them. Sometimes it befell\nIn these night wanderings, that a strong desire\nO'erpowered my better reason, and the bird\nWhich was the captive of another's toil320\nBecame my prey; and when the deed was done\nI heard among the solitary hills\nLow breathings coming after me, and sounds\nOf undistinguishable motion, steps\nAlmost as silent as the turf they trod.\nNor less, when spring had warmed the cultured Vale,\nMoved we as plunderers where the mother-bird\nHad in high places built her lodge; though mean\nOur object and inglorious, yet the end\nWas not ignoble. Oh! when I have hung 330\nAbove the raven's nest, by knots of grass\nAnd half-inch fissures in the slippery rock\nBut ill sustained, and almost (so it seemed)\nSuspended by the blast that blew amain,\nShouldering the naked crag, oh, at that time\nWhile on the perilous ridge I hung alone,\nWith what strange utterance did the loud dry wind\nBlow through my ear! the sky seemed not a sky\nOf earth--and with what motion moved the clouds!\nDust as we are, the immortal spirit grows\nLike harmony in music; there is a dark\nInscrutable workmanship that reconciles\nDiscordant elements, makes them cling together\nIn one society. How strange, that all\nThe terrors, pains, and early miseries,\nRegrets, vexations, lassitudes interfused\nWithin my mind, should e'er have borne a part,\nAnd that a needful part, in making up\nThe calm existence that is mine when I\nAm worthy of myself! Praise to the end!350\nThanks to the means which Nature deigned to employ;\nWhether her fearless visitings, or those\nThat came with soft alarm, like hurtless light\nOpening the peaceful clouds; or she would use\nSeverer interventions, ministry\nMore palpable, as best might suit her aim.\nOne summer evening (led by her) I found\nA little boat tied to a willow tree\n\nWithin a rocky cave, its usual home.\nStraight I unloosed her chain, and stepping in 360\nPushed from the shore. It was an act of stealth\nAnd troubled pleasure, nor without the voice\nOf mountain-echoes did my boat move on;\nLeaving behind her still, on either side,\nSmall circles glittering idly in the moon,\nUntil they melted all into one track\nOf sparkling light. But now, like one who rows,\nProud of his skill, to reach a chosen point\nWith an unswerving line, I fixed my view\nUpon the summit of a craggy ridge,\nThe horizon's utmost boundary; far above\nWas nothing but the stars and the grey sky.\nShe was an elfin pinnace; lustily\nI dipped my oars into the silent lake,\nAnd, as I rose upon the stroke, my boat\nWent heaving through the water like a swan;\nWhen, from behind that craggy steep till then\nThe horizon's bound, a huge peak, black and huge,\nAs if with voluntary power instinct,\nUpreared its head. I struck and struck again, 380\nAnd growing still in stature the grim shape\nTowered up between me and the stars, and still,\nFor so it seemed, with purpose of its own\nAnd measured motion like a living thing,\nStrode after me. With trembling oars I turned,\nAnd through the silent water stole my way\nBack to the covert of the willow tree;\nThere in her mooring-place I left my bark,--\nAnd through the meadows homeward went, in grave\nAnd serious mood; but after I had seen 390\nThat spectacle, for many days, my brain\nWorked with a dim and undetermined sense\nOf unknown modes of being; o'er my thoughts\nThere hung a darkness, call it solitude\nOr blank desertion. No familiar shapes\nRemained, no pleasant images of trees,\nOf sea or sky, no colours of green fields;\nBut huge and mighty forms, that do not live\nLike living men, moved slowly through the mind\nBy day, and were a trouble to my dreams.\nWisdom and Spirit of the universe!\nThou Soul that art the eternity of thought\nThat givest to forms and images a breath\nAnd everlasting motion, not in vain\nBy day or star-light thus from my first dawn\nOf childhood didst thou intertwine for me\nThe passions that build up our human soul;\nNot with the mean and vulgar works of man,\n\nBut with high objects, with enduring things-\nnature--purifying thus 410\nThe elements of feeling and of thought,\nAnd sanctifying, by such discipline,\nBoth pain and fear, until we recognise\nA grandeur in the beatings of the heart.\nNor was this fellowship vouchsafed to me\nWith stinted kindness. In November days,\nWhen vapours rolling down the valley made\nA lonely scene more lonesome, among woods,\nAt noon and 'mid the calm of summer nights,\nWhen, by the margin of the trembling lake,\nBeneath the gloomy hills homeward I went\nIn solitude, such intercourse was mine;\nMine was it in the fields both day and night,\nAnd by the waters, all the summer long.\nAnd in the frosty season, when the sun\nWas set, and visible for many a mile\nThe cottage windows blazed through twilight gloom,\nI heeded not their summons: happy time\nIt was indeed for all of us--for me\nIt was a time of rapture! Clear and loud\nThe village clock tolled six,--I wheeled about,\nProud and exulting like an untired horse\nThat cares not for his home. All shod with steel,\nWe hissed along the polished ice in games\nConfederate, imitative of the chase\nAnd woodland pleasures,--the resounding horn,\nThe pack loud chiming, and the hunted hare.\nSo through the darkness and the cold we flew,\nAnd not a voice was idle; with the din\nSmitten, the precipices rang aloud; 440\nThe leafless trees and every icy crag\nTinkled like iron; while far distant hills\nInto the tumult sent an alien sound\nOf melancholy not unnoticed, while the stars\nEastward were sparkling clear, and in the west\nThe orange sky of evening died away.\nNot seldom from the uproar I retired\nInto a silent bay, or sportively\nGlanced sideway, leaving the tumultuous throng,\nTo cut across the reflex of a star\nThat fled, and, flying still before me, gleamed\nUpon the glassy plain; and oftentimes,\nWhen we had given our bodies to the wind,\nAnd all the shadowy banks on either side\nCame sweeping through the darkness, spinning still\nThe rapid line of motion, then at once\nHave I, reclining back upon my heels,\nStopped short; yet still the solitary cliffs\n\nWheeled by me--even as if the earth had rolled\nWith visible motion her diurnal round! 460\nBehind me did they stretch in solemn train,\nFeebler and feebler, and I stood and watched\nTill all was tranquil as a dreamless sleep.\nYe Presences of Nature in the sky\nAnd on the earth! Ye Visions of the hills!\nAnd Souls of lonely places! can I think\nA vulgar hope was yours when ye employed\nSuch ministry, when ye, through many a year\nHaunting me thus among my boyish sports,\nOn caves and trees, upon the woods and hills, 470\nImpressed, upon all forms, the characters\nOf danger or desire; and thus did make\nThe surface of the universal earth,\nWith triumph and delight, with hope and fear,\nWork like a sea?\nNot uselessly employed,\nMight I pursue this theme through every change\nOf exercise and play, to which the year\nDid summon us in his delightful round.\nWe were a noisy crew; the sun in heaven\nBeheld not vales more beautiful than ours;\nNor saw a band in happiness and joy 480\nRicher, or worthier of the ground they trod.\nI could record with no reluctant voice\nThe woods of autumn, and their hazel bowers\nWith milk-white clusters hung; the rod and line,\nTrue symbol of hope's foolishness, whose strong\nAnd unreproved enchantment led us on\nBy rocks and pools shut out from every star,\nAll the green summer, to forlorn cascades\nAmong the windings hid of mountain brooks.\n--Unfading recollections! at this hour 490\nThe heart is almost mine with which I felt,\nFrom some hill-top on sunny afternoons,\nThe paper kite high among fleecy clouds\nPull at her rein like an impetuous courser;\nOr, from the meadows sent on gusty days,\nBeheld her breast the wind, then suddenly\nDashed headlong, and rejected by the storm.\nYe lowly cottages wherein we dwelt,\nA ministration of your own was yours;\nCan I forget you, being as you were 500\nSo beautiful among the pleasant fields\nIn which ye stood? or can I here forget\nThe plain and seemly countenance with which\nYe dealt out your plain comforts? Yet had ye\n\nDelights and exultations of your own.\nEager and never weary we pursued\nOur home-amusements by the warm peat-fire\nAt evening, when with pencil, and smooth slate\nIn square divisions parcelled out and all\nWith crosses and with cyphers scribbled o'er, 510\nWe schemed and puzzled, head opposed to head\nIn strife too humble to be named in verse:\nOr round the naked table, snow-white deal,\nCherry or maple, sate in close array,\nAnd to the combat, Loo or Whist, led on\nA thick-ribbed army; not, as in the world,\nNeglected and ungratefully thrown by\nEven for the very service they had wrought,\nBut husbanded through many a long campaign.\nUncouth assemblage was it, where no few520\nHad changed their functions: some, plebeian cards\nWhich Fate, beyond the promise of their birth,\nHad dignified, and called to represent\nThe persons of departed potentates.\nOh, with what echoes on the board they fell!\nIronic diamonds,--clubs, hearts, diamonds, spades,\nA congregation piteously akin!\nCheap matter offered they to boyish wit,\nThose sooty knaves, precipitated down\nWith scoffs and taunts, like Vulcan out of heaven:\nThe paramount ace, a moon in her eclipse,\nQueens gleaming through their splendour's last decay,\nAnd monarchs surly at the wrongs sustained\nBy royal visages. Meanwhile abroad\nIncessant rain was falling, or the frost\nRaged bitterly, with keen and silent tooth;\nAnd, interrupting oft that eager game,\nFrom under Esthwaite's splitting fields of ice\nThe pent-up air, struggling to free itself,\nGave out to meadow grounds and hills a loud\nProtracted yelling, like the noise of wolves\nHowling in troops along the Bothnic Main.\nNor, sedulous as I have been to trace\nHow Nature by extrinsic passion first\nPeopled the mind with forms sublime or fair,\nAnd made me love them, may I here omit\nHow other pleasures have been mine, and joys\nOf subtler origin; how I have felt,\nNot seldom even in that tempestuous time,\nThose hallowed and pure motions of the sense\nWhich seem, in their simplicity, to own\nAn intellectual charm; that calm delight\nWhich, if I err not, surely must belong\nTo those first-born affinities that fit\n\nOur new existence to existing things,\nAnd, in our dawn of being, constitute\nThe bond of union between life and joy.\nYes, I remember when the changeful earth,\nAnd twice five summers on my mind had stamped\nThe faces of the moving year, even then560\nI held unconscious intercourse with beauty\nOld as creation, drinking in a pure\nOrganic pleasure from the silver wreaths\nOf curling mist, or from the level plain\nOf waters coloured by impending clouds.\nThe sands of Westmoreland, the creeks and bays\nOf Cumbria's rocky limits, they can tell\nHow, when the Sea threw off his evening shade,\nAnd to the shepherd's hut on distant hills\nSent welcome notice of the rising moon,570\nHow I have stood, to fancies such as these\nA stranger, linking with the spectacle\nNo conscious memory of a kindred sight,\nAnd bringing with me no peculiar sense\nOf quietness or peace; yet have I stood,\nEven while mine eye hath moved o'er many a league\nOf shining water, gathering as it seemed,\nThrough every hair-breadth in that field of light,\nNew pleasure like a bee among the flowers.\nThus oft amid those fits of vulgar joy\nWhich, through all seasons, on a child's pursuits\nAre prompt attendants, 'mid that giddy bliss\nWhich, like a tempest, works along the blood\nAnd is forgotten; even then I felt\nGleams like the flashing of a shield;--the earth\nAnd common face of Nature spake to me\nRememberable things; sometimes, 'tis true,\nBy chance collisions and quaint accidents\n(Like those ill-sorted unions, work supposed\nOf evil-minded fairies), yet not vain 590\nNor profitless, if haply they impressed\nCollateral objects and appearances,\nAlbeit lifeless then, and doomed to sleep\nUntil maturer seasons called them forth\nTo impregnate and to elevate the mind.\n--And if the vulgar joy by its own weight\nWearied itself out of the memory,\nThe scenes which were a witness of that joy\nRemained in their substantial lineaments\nDepicted on the brain, and to the eye 600\nWere visible, a daily sight; and thus\nBy the impressive discipline of fear,\n\nBy pleasure and repeated happiness,\nSo frequently repeated, and by force\nOf obscure feelings representative\nOf things forgotten, these same scenes so bright,\nSo beautiful, so majestic in themselves,\nThough yet the day was distant, did become\nHabitually dear, and all their forms\nAnd changeful colours by invisible links\nWere fastened to the affections.\nI began\nMy story early--not misled, I trust,\nBy an infirmity of love for days\nDisowned by memory--ere the breath of spring\nPlanting my snowdrops among winter snows:\nNor will it seem to thee, O Friend! so prompt\nIn sympathy, that I have lengthened out\nWith fond and feeble tongue a tedious tale.\nMeanwhile, my hope has been, that I might fetch\nInvigorating thoughts from former years;\nMight fix the wavering balance of my mind,\nAnd haply meet reproaches too, whose power\nMay spur me on, in manhood now mature\nTo honourable toil. Yet should these hopes\nProve vain, and thus should neither I be taught\nTo understand myself, nor thou to know\nWith better knowledge how the heart was framed\nOf him thou lovest; need I dread from thee\nHarsh judgments, if the song be loth to quit\nThose recollected hours that have the charm\nOf visionary things, those lovely forms\nAnd sweet sensations that throw back our life,\nAnd almost make remotest infancy\nA visible scene, on which the sun is shining?\nOne end at least hath been attained; my mind\nHath been revived, and if this genial mood\nDesert me not, forthwith shall be brought down\nThrough later years the story of my life.\nThe road lies plain before me;--'tis a theme\nSingle and of determined bounds; and hence\nI choose it rather at this time, than work\nOf ampler or more varied argument,\nWhere I might be discomfited and lost:\nAnd certain hopes are with me, that to thee\nThis labour will be welcome, honoured Friend!\nOOK SECOND\nSCHOOL-TIME (continued)\n\nTHUS far, O Friend! have we, though leaving much\nUnvisited, endeavoured to retrace\nThe simple ways in which my childhood walked;\nThose chiefly that first led me to the love\nOf rivers, woods, and fields. The passion yet\nWas in its birth, sustained as might befall\nBy nourishment that came unsought; for still\nFrom week to week, from month to month, we lived\nA round of tumult. Duly were our games\nProlonged in summer till the daylight failed:\nNo chair remained before the doors; the bench\nAnd threshold steps were empty; fast asleep\nThe labourer, and the old man who had sate\nA later lingerer; yet the revelry\nContinued and the loud uproar: at last,\nWhen all the ground was dark, and twinkling stars\nEdged the black clouds, home and to bed we went,\nFeverish with weary joints and beating minds.\nAh! is there one who ever has been young,\nNor needs a warning voice to tame the pride\nOf intellect and virtue's self-esteem?\nOne is there, though the wisest and the best\nOf all mankind, who covets not at times\nUnion that cannot be;--who would not give\nIf so he might, to duty and to truth\nThe eagerness of infantine desire?\nA tranquillising spirit presses now\nOn my corporeal frame, so wide appears\nThe vacancy between me and those days\nWhich yet have such self-presence in my mind,\nThat, musing on them, often do I seem\nTwo consciousnesses, conscious of myself\nAnd of some other Being. A rude mass\nOf native rock, left midway in the square\nOf our small market village, was the goal\nOr centre of these sports; and when, returned\nAfter long absence, thither I repaired,\nGone was the old grey stone, and in its place\nA smart Assembly-room usurped the ground\nThat had been ours. There let the fiddle scream, 40\nAnd be ye happy! Yet, my Friends! I know\nThat more than one of you will think with me\nOf those soft starry nights, and that old Dame\nFrom whom the stone was named, who there had sate,\nAnd watched her table with its huckster's wares\nAssiduous, through the length of sixty years.\nWe ran a boisterous course; the year span round\nWith giddy motion. But the time approached\nThat brought with it a regular desire\nFor calmer pleasures, when the winning forms\n\nOf Nature were collaterally attached\nTo every scheme of holiday delight\nAnd every boyish sport, less grateful else\nAnd languidly pursued.\nWhen summer came,\nOur pastime was, on bright half-holidays,\nTo sweep along the plain of Windermere\nWith rival oars; and the selected bourne\nWas now an Island musical with birds\nThat sang and ceased not; now a Sister Isle\nBeneath the oaks' umbrageous covert, sown\nWith lilies of the valley like a field;\nAnd now a third small Island, where survived\nIn solitude the ruins of a shrine\nOnce to Our Lady dedicate, and served\nDaily with chaunted rites. In such a race\nSo ended, disappointment could be none,\nUneasiness, or pain, or jealousy:\nWe rested in the shade, all pleased alike,\nConquered and conqueror. Thus the pride of strength,\nAnd the vain-glory of superior skill, 70\nWere tempered; thus was gradually produced\nA quiet independence of the heart;\nAnd to my Friend who knows me I may add,\nFearless of blame, that hence for future days\nEnsued a diffidence and modesty,\nAnd I was taught to feel, perhaps too much,\nThe self-sufficing power of Solitude.\nOur daily meals were frugal, Sabine fare!\nMore than we wished we knew the blessing then\nOf vigorous hunger--hence corporeal strength\nUnsapped by delicate viands; for, exclude\nA little weekly stipend, and we lived\nThrough three divisions of the quartered year\nIn penniless poverty. But now to school\nFrom the half-yearly holidays returned,\nWe came with weightier purses, that sufficed\nTo furnish treats more costly than the Dame\nOf the old grey stone, from her scant board, supplied.\nHence rustic dinners on the cool green ground,\nOr in the woods, or by a river side\nOr shady fountains, while among the leaves\nSoft airs were stirring, and the mid-day sun\nUnfelt shone brightly round us in our joy.\nNor is my aim neglected if I tell\nHow sometimes, in the length of those half-years,\nWe from our funds drew largely;--proud to curb,\nAnd eager to spur on, the galloping steed;\nAnd with the courteous inn-keeper, whose stud\nSupplied our want, we haply might employ\n\nSly subterfuge, if the adventure's bound\nWere distant: some famed temple where of yore\nThe Druids worshipped, or the antique walls\nOf that large abbey, where within the Vale\nOf Nightshade, to St. Mary's honour built,\nStands yet a mouldering pile with fractured arch,\nBelfry, and images, and living trees;\nA holy scene!--Along the smooth green turf\nOur horses grazed. To more than inland peace,\nLeft by the west wind sweeping overhead\nFrom a tumultuous ocean, trees and towers\nIn that sequestered valley may be seen,\nBoth silent and both motionless alike;\nSuch the deep shelter that is there, and such\nThe safeguard for repose and quietness.\nOur steeds remounted and the summons given,\nWith whip and spur we through the chauntry flew\nIn uncouth race, and left the cross-legged knight,\nAnd the stone-abbot, and that single wren\nWhich one day sang so sweetly in the nave\nOf the old church, that--though from recent showers\nThe earth was comfortless, and, touched by faint\nInternal breezes, sobbings of the place\nAnd respirations, from the roofless walls\nThe shuddering ivy dripped large drops--yet still\nSo sweetly 'mid the gloom the invisible bird\nSang to herself, that there I could have made\nMy dwelling-place, and lived for ever there\nTo hear such music. Through the walls we flew\nAnd down the valley, and, a circuit made\nIn wantonness of heart, through rough and smooth 130\nWe scampered homewards. Oh, ye rocks and streams,\nAnd that still spirit shed from evening air!\nEven in this joyous time I sometimes felt\nYour presence, when with slackened step we breathed\nAlong the sides of the steep hills, or when\nLighted by gleams of moonlight from the sea\nWe beat with thundering hoofs the level sand.\nMidway on long Winander's eastern shore,\nWithin the crescent of pleasant bay,\nA tavern stood; no homely-featured house,\nPrimeval like its neighbouring cottages,\nBut 'twas a splendid place, the door beset\nWith chaises, grooms, and liveries, and within\nDecanters, glasses, and the blood-red wine.\nIn ancient times, and ere the Hall was built\nOn the large island, had this dwelling been\nMore worthy of a poet's love, a hut,\nProud of its own bright fire and sycamore shade.\n\nBut--though the rhymes were gone that once inscribed\nThe threshold, and large golden characters,\nSpread o'er the spangled sign-board, had dislodged\nThe old Lion and usurped his place, in slight\nAnd mockery of the rustic painter's hand-\no me is dear\nWith all its foolish pomp. The garden lay\nUpon a slope surmounted by a plain\nOf a small bowling-green; beneath us stood\nA grove, with gleams of water through the trees\nAnd over the tree-tops; nor did we want\nRefreshment, strawberries and mellow cream.\nThere, while through half an afternoon we played\nOn the smooth platform, whether skill prevailed\nOr happy blunder triumphed, bursts of glee\nMade all the mountains ring. But, ere night-fall,\nWhen in our pinnace we returned at leisure\nOver the shadowy lake, and to the beach\nOf some small island steered our course with one,\nThe Minstrel of the Troop, and left him there,\nAnd rowed off gently, while he blew his flute\nAlone upon the rock--oh, then, the calm170\nAnd dead still water lay upon my mind\nEven with a weight of pleasure, and the sky,\nNever before so beautiful, sank down\nInto my heart, and held me like a dream!\nThus were my sympathies enlarged, and thus\nDaily the common range of visible things\nGrew dear to me: already I began\nTo love the sun; a boy I loved the sun,\nNot as I since have loved him, as a pledge\nAnd surety of our earthly life, a light180\nWhich we behold and feel we are alive;\nNor for his bounty to so many worlds-\nause, that I had seen him lay\nHis beauty on the morning hills, had seen\nThe western mountain touch his setting orb,\nIn many a thoughtless hour, when, from excess\nOf happiness, my blood appeared to flow\nFor its own pleasure, and I breathed with joy.\nAnd, from like feelings, humble though intense,\nTo patriotic and domestic love\nAnalogous, the moon to me was dear;\nFor I could dream away my purposes,\nStanding to gaze upon her while she hung\nMidway between the hills, as if she knew\nNo other region, but belonged to thee,\nYea, appertained by a peculiar right\nTo thee and thy grey huts, thou one dear Vale!\nThose incidental charms which first attached\n\nMy heart to rural objects, day by day\nGrew weaker, and I hasten on to tell 200\nHow Nature, intervenient till this time\nAnd secondary, now at length was sought\nFor her own sake. But who shall parcel out\nHis intellect by geometric rules,\nSplit like a province into round and square?\nWho knows the individual hour in which\nHis habits were first sown, even as a seed?\nWho that shall point as with a wand and say\n\"This portion of the river of my mind\nCame from yon fountain?\" Thou, my Friend! art one210\nMore deeply read in thy own thoughts; to thee\nScience appears but what in truth she is,\nNot as our glory and our absolute boast,\nBut as a succedaneum, and a prop\nTo our infirmity. No officious slave\nArt thou of that false secondary power\nBy which we multiply distinctions, then\nDeem that our puny boundaries are things\nThat we perceive, and not that we have made.\nTo thee, unblinded by these formal arts,\nThe unity of all hath been revealed,\nAnd thou wilt doubt, with me less aptly skilled\nThan many are to range the faculties\nIn scale and order, class the cabinet\nOf their sensations, and in voluble phrase\nRun through the history and birth of each\nAs of a single independent thing.\nHard task, vain hope, to analyse the mind,\nIf each most obvious and particular thought,\nNot in a mystical and idle sense,\nBut in the words of Reason deeply weighed,\nHath no beginning.\nBlest the infant Babe,\n(For with my best conjecture I would trace\nOur Being's earthly progress,) blest the Babe,\nNursed in his Mother's arms, who sinks to sleep\nRocked on his Mother's breast; who with his soul\nDrinks in the feelings of his Mother's eye!\nFor him, in one dear Presence, there exists\nA virtue which irradiates and exalts\nObjects through widest intercourse of sense.\nNo outcast he, bewildered and depressed:\nAlong his infant veins are interfused\nThe gravitation and the filial bond\nOf nature that connect him with the world.\nIs there a flower, to which he points with hand\nToo weak to gather it, already love\nDrawn from love's purest earthly fount for him\nHath beautified that flower; already shades\n\nOf pity cast from inward tenderness\nDo fall around him upon aught that bears\nUnsightly marks of violence or harm.\nEmphatically such a Being lives,\nFrail creature as he is, helpless as frail,\nAn inmate of this active universe:\nFor, feeling has to him imparted power\nThat through the growing faculties of sense\nDoth like an agent of the one great Mind\nCreate, creator and receiver both,\nWorking but in alliance with the works\nWhich it beholds.--Such, verily, is the first 260\nPoetic spirit of our human life,\nBy uniform control of after years,\nIn most, abated or suppressed; in some,\nThrough every change of growth and of decay,\nPre-eminent till death.\nFrom early days,\nBeginning not long after that first time\nIn which, a Babe, by intercourse of touch\nI held mute dialogues with my Mother's heart,\nI have endeavoured to display the means\nWhereby this infant sensibility,\nGreat birthright of our being, was in me\nAugmented and sustained. Yet is a path\nMore difficult before me; and I fear\nThat in its broken windings we shall need\nThe chamois' sinews, and the eagle's wing:\nFor now a trouble came into my mind\nFrom unknown causes. I was left alone\nSeeking the visible world, nor knowing why.\nThe props of my affections were removed,\nAnd yet the building stood, as if sustained\nBy its own spirit! All that I beheld\nWas dear, and hence to finer influxes\nThe mind lay open to a more exact\nAnd close communion. Many are our joys\nIn youth, but oh! what happiness to live\nWhen every hour brings palpable access\nOf knowledge, when all knowledge is delight,\nAnd sorrow is not there! The seasons came,\nAnd every season wheresoe'er I moved\nUnfolded transitory qualities,\nWhich, but for this most watchful power of love,\nHad been neglected; left a register\nOf permanent relations, else unknown.\nHence life, and change, and beauty, solitude\nMore active ever than \"best society\"--\nSociety made sweet as solitude\nBy silent inobtrusive sympathies,\nAnd gentle agitations of the mind\n\nFrom manifold distinctions, difference\nPerceived in things, where, to the unwatchful eye,\nNo difference is, and hence, from the same source,\nSublimer joy; for I would walk alone,\nUnder the quiet stars, and at that time\nHave felt whate'er there is of power in sound\nTo breathe an elevated mood, by form\nOr image unprofaned; and I would stand,\nIf the night blackened with a coming storm,\nBeneath some rock, listening to notes that are\nThe ghostly language of the ancient earth,\nOr make their dim abode in distant winds.\nThence did I drink the visionary power;\nAnd deem not profitless those fleeting moods\nOf shadowy exultation: not for this,\nThat they are kindred to our purer mind\nAnd intellectual life; but that the soul,\nRemembering how she felt, but what she felt\nRemembering not, retains an obscure sense\nOf possible sublimity, whereto\nWith growing faculties she doth aspire,\nWith faculties still growing, feeling still\nThat whatsoever point they gain, they yet\nHave something to pursue.\nAnd not alone,\n'Mid gloom and tumult, but no less 'mid fair\nAnd tranquil scenes, that universal power\nAnd fitness in the latent qualities\nAnd essences of things, by which the mind\nIs moved with feelings of delight, to me\nCame strengthened with a superadded soul,\nA virtue not its own. My morning walks\nWere early;--oft before the hours of school\nI travelled round our little lake, five miles\nOf pleasant wandering. Happy time! more dear\nFor this, that one was by my side, a Friend,\nThen passionately loved; with heart how full\nWould he peruse these lines! For many years\nHave since flowed in between us, and, our minds\nBoth silent to each other, at this time\nWe live as if those hours had never been.\nNor seldom did I lift our cottage latch\nFar earlier, ere one smoke-wreath had risen\nFrom human dwelling, or the vernal thrush\nWas audible; and sate among the woods\nAlone upon some jutting eminence,\nAt the first gleam of dawn-light, when the Vale,\nYet slumbering, lay in utter solitude.\nHow shall I seek the origin? where find\nFaith in the marvellous things which then I felt?\nOft in these moments such a holy calm\n\nWould overspread my soul, that bodily eyes\nWere utterly forgotten, and what I saw 350\nAppeared like something in myself, a dream,\nA prospect in the mind.\n'Twere long to tell\nWhat spring and autumn, what the winter snows,\nAnd what the summer shade, what day and night,\nEvening and morning, sleep and waking, thought\nFrom sources inexhaustible, poured forth\nTo feed the spirit of religious love\nIn which I walked with Nature. But let this\nBe not forgotten, that I still retained\nMy first creative sensibility;\nThat by the regular action of the world\nMy soul was unsubdued. A plastic power\nAbode with me; a forming hand, at times\nRebellious, acting in a devious mood;\nA local spirit of his own, at war\nWith general tendency, but, for the most,\nSubservient strictly to external things\nWith which it communed. An auxiliar light\nCame from my mind, which on the setting sun\nBestowed new splendour; the melodious birds,\nThe fluttering breezes, fountains that run on\nMurmuring so sweetly in themselves, obeyed\nA like dominion, and the midnight storm\nGrew darker in the presence of my eye:\nHence my obeisance, my devotion hence,\nAnd hence my transport.\nNor should this, perchance,\nPass unrecorded, that I still had loved\nThe exercise and produce of a toil,\nThan analytic industry to me\nMore pleasing, and whose character I deem\nIs more poetic as resembling more\nCreative agency. The song would speak\nOf that interminable building reared\nBy observation of affinities\nIn objects where no brotherhood exists\nTo passive minds. My seventeenth year was come\nAnd, whether from this habit rooted now\nSo deeply in my mind, or from excess\nIn the great social principle of life\nCoercing all things into sympathy,\nTo unorganic natures were transferred\nMy own enjoyments; or the power of truth\nComing in revelation, did converse\nWith things that really are; I, at this time,\nSaw blessings spread around me like a sea.\nThus while the days flew by, and years passed on,\nFrom Nature and her overflowing soul,\n\nI had received so much, that all my thoughts\nWere steeped in feeling; I was only then\nContented, when with bliss ineffable 400\nI felt the sentiment of Being spread\nO'er all that moves and all that seemeth still;\nO'er all that, lost beyond the reach of thought\nAnd human knowledge, to the human eye\nInvisible, yet liveth to the heart;\nO'er all that leaps and runs, and shouts and sings,\nOr beats the gladsome air; o'er all that glides\nBeneath the wave, yea, in the wave itself,\nAnd mighty depth of waters. Wonder not\nIf high the transport, great the joy I felt,\nCommuning in this sort through earth and heaven\nWith every form of creature, as it looked\nTowards the Uncreated with a countenance\nOf adoration, with an eye of love.\nOne song they sang, and it was audible,\nMost audible, then, when the fleshly ear,\nO'ercome by humblest prelude of that strain\nForgot her functions, and slept undisturbed.\nIf this be error, and another faith\nFind easier access to the pious mind, 420\nYet were I grossly destitute of all\nThose human sentiments that make this earth\nSo dear, if I should fail with grateful voice\nTo speak of you, ye mountains, and ye lakes\nAnd sounding cataracts, ye mists and winds\nThat dwell among the hills where I was born.\nIf in my youth I have been pure in heart,\nIf, mingling with the world, I am content\nWith my own modest pleasures, and have lived\nWith God and Nature communing, removed 430\nFrom little enmities and low desires-\nyours; if in these times of fear,\nThis melancholy waste of hopes o'erthrown,\nIf, 'mid indifference and apathy,\nAnd wicked exultation when good men\nOn every side fall off, we know not how,\nTo selfishness, disguised in gentle names\nOf peace and quiet and domestic love\nYet mingled not unwillingly with sneers\nOn visionary minds; if, in this time 440\nOf dereliction and dismay, I yet\nDespair not of our nature, but retain\nA more than Roman confidence, a faith\nThat fails not, in all sorrow my support,\nThe blessing of my life--the gift is yours,\nYe winds and sounding cataracts! 'tis yours,\nYe mountains! thine, O Nature! Thou hast fed\n\nMy lofty speculations; and in thee,\nFor this uneasy heart of ours, I find\nA never-failing principle of joy\nAnd purest passion.\nThou, my Friend! wert reared\nIn the great city, 'mid far other scenes;\nBut we, by different roads, at length have gained\nThe selfsame bourne. And for this cause to thee\nI speak, unapprehensive of contempt,\nThe insinuated scoff of coward tongues,\nAnd all that silent language which so oft\nIn conversation between man and man\nBlots from the human countenance all trace\nOf beauty and of love. For thou hast sought\nThe truth in solitude, and, since the days\nThat gave thee liberty, full long desired,\nTo serve in Nature's temple, thou hast been\nThe most assiduous of her ministers;\nIn many things my brother, chiefly here\nIn this our deep devotion.\nFare thee well!\nHealth and the quiet of a healthful mind\nAttend thee! seeking oft the haunts of men,\nAnd yet more often living with thyself,\nAnd for thyself, so haply shall thy days\nBe many, and a blessing to mankind.\nBOOK THIRD\nRESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE\nIT was a dreary morning when the wheels\nRolled over a wide plain o'erhung with clouds,\nAnd nothing cheered our way till first we saw\nThe long-roofed chapel of King's College lift\nTurrets and pinnacles in answering files,\nExtended high above a dusky grove.\nAdvancing, we espied upon the road\nA student clothed in gown and tasselled cap,\nStriding along as if o'ertasked by Time,\nOr covetous of exercise and air;\nHe passed--nor was I master of my eyes\nTill he was left an arrow's flight behind.\nAs near and nearer to the spot we drew,\nIt seemed to suck us in with an eddy's force.\nOnward we drove beneath the Castle; caught,\nWhile crossing Magdalene Bridge, a glimpse of Cam;\nAnd at the \"Hoop\" alighted, famous Inn.\n\nMy spirit was up, my thoughts were full of hope;\nSome friends I had, acquaintances who there\nSeemed friends, poor simple schoolboys, now hung round\nWith honour and importance: in a world\nOf welcome faces up and down I roved;\nQuestions, directions, warnings and advice,\nFlowed in upon me, from all sides; fresh day\nOf pride and pleasure! to myself I seemed\nA man of business and expense, and went\nFrom shop to shop about my own affairs,\nTo Tutor or to Tailor, as befell,\nFrom street to street with loose and careless mind.\nI was the Dreamer, they the Dream; I roamed\nDelighted through the motley spectacle;\nGowns grave, or gaudy, doctors, students, streets,\nCourts, cloisters, flocks of churches, gateways, towers:\nMigration strange for a stripling of the hills,\nA northern villager.\nAs if the change\nHad waited on some Fairy's wand, at once\nBehold me rich in monies, and attired\nIn splendid garb, with hose of silk, and hair\nPowdered like rimy trees, when frost is keen.\nMy lordly dressing-gown, I pass it by, 40\nWith other signs of manhood that supplied\nThe lack of beard.--The weeks went roundly on,\nWith invitations, suppers, wine and fruit,\nSmooth housekeeping within, and all without\nLiberal, and suiting gentleman's array.\nThe Evangelist St. John my patron was:\nThree Gothic courts are his, and in the first\nWas my abiding-place, a nook obscure;\nRight underneath, the College kitchens made\nA humming sound, less tuneable than bees,\nBut hardly less industrious; with shrill notes\nOf sharp command and scolding intermixed.\nNear me hung Trinity's loquacious clock,\nWho never let the quarters, night or day,\nSlip by him unproclaimed, and told the hours\nTwice over with a male and female voice.\nHer pealing organ was my neighbour too;\nAnd from my pillow, looking forth by light\nOf moon or favouring stars, I could behold\nThe antechapel where the statue stood 60\nOf Newton with his prism and silent face,\nThe marble index of a mind for ever\nVoyaging through strange seas of Thought, alone.\nOf College labours, of the Lecturer's room\n\nAll studded round, as thick as chairs could stand,\nWith loyal students, faithful to their books,\nHalf-and-half idlers, hardy recusants,\nAnd honest dunces--of important days,\nExaminations, when the man was weighed\nAs in a balance! of excessive hopes, 70\nTremblings withal and commendable fears,\nSmall jealousies, and triumphs good or bad-\nore speak as they know.\nSuch glory was but little sought by me,\nAnd little won. Yet from the first crude days\nOf settling time in this untried abode,\nI was disturbed at times by prudent thoughts,\nWishing to hope without a hope, some fears\nAbout my future worldly maintenance,\nAnd, more than all, a strangeness in the mind, 80\nA feeling that I was not for that hour,\nNor for that place. But wherefore be cast down?\nFor (not to speak of Reason and her pure\nReflective acts to fix the moral law\nDeep in the conscience, nor of Christian Hope,\nBowing her head before her sister Faith\nAs one far mightier), hither I had come,\nBear witness Truth, endowed with holy powers\nAnd faculties, whether to work or feel.\nOft when the dazzling show no longer new90\nHad ceased to dazzle, ofttimes did I quit\nMy comrades, leave the crowd, buildings and groves,\nAnd as I paced alone the level fields\nFar from those lovely sights and sounds sublime\nWith which I had been conversant, the mind\nDrooped not; but there into herself returning,\nWith prompt rebound seemed fresh as heretofore.\nAt least I more distinctly recognised\nHer native instincts: let me dare to speak\nA higher language, say that now I felt 100\nWhat independent solaces were mine,\nTo mitigate the injurious sway of place\nOr circumstance, how far soever changed\nIn youth, or 'to' be changed in after years.\nAs if awakened, summoned, roused, constrained,\nI looked for universal things; perused\nThe common countenance of earth and sky:\nEarth, nowhere unembellished by some trace\nOf that first Paradise whence man was driven;\nAnd sky, whose beauty and bounty are expressed 110\nBy the proud name she bears--the name of Heaven.\nI called on both to teach me what they might;\nOr, turning the mind in upon herself,\nPored, watched, expected, listened, spread my thoughts\nAnd spread them with a wider creeping; felt\n\nIncumbencies more awful, visitings\nOf the Upholder of the tranquil soul,\nThat tolerates the indignities of Time,\nAnd, from the centre of Eternity\nAll finite motions overruling, lives 120\nIn glory immutable. But peace! enough\nHere to record that I was mounting now\nTo such community with highest truth-\nA track pursuing, not untrod before,\nFrom strict analogies by thought supplied\nOr consciousnesses not to be subdued.\nTo every natural form, rock, fruits, or flower,\nEven the loose stones that cover the highway,\nI gave a moral life: I saw them feel,\nOr linked them to some feeling: the great mass 130\nLay bedded in a quickening soul, and all\nThat I beheld respired with inward meaning.\nAdd that whate'er of Terror or of Love\nOr Beauty, Nature's daily face put on\nFrom transitory passion, unto this\nI was as sensitive as waters are\nTo the sky's influence in a kindred mood\nOf passion; was obedient as a lute\nThat waits upon the touches of the wind.\nUnknown, unthought of, yet I was most rich--\nI had a world about me--'twas my own;\nI made it, for it only lived to me,\nAnd to the God who sees into the heart.\nSuch sympathies, though rarely, were betrayed\nBy outward gestures and by visible looks:\nSome called it madness--so indeed it was,\nIf child-like fruitfulness in passing joy,\nIf steady moods of thoughtfulness matured\nTo inspiration, sort with such a name;\nIf prophecy be madness; if things viewed\nBy poets in old time, and higher up\nBy the first men, earth's first inhabitants,\nMay in these tutored days no more be seen\nWith undisordered sight. But leaving this,\nIt was no madness, for the bodily eye\nAmid my strongest workings evermore\nWas searching out the lines of difference\nAs they lie hid in all external forms,\nNear or remote, minute or vast; an eye\nWhich, from a tree, a stone, a withered leaf, 160\nTo the broad ocean and the azure heavens\nSpangled with kindred multitudes of stars,\nCould find no surface where its power might sleep;\nWhich spake perpetual logic to my soul,\nAnd by an unrelenting agency\nDid bind my feelings even as in a chain.\n\nAnd here, O Friend! have I retraced my life\nUp to an eminence, and told a tale\nOf matters which not falsely may be called\nThe glory of my youth. Of genius, power,\nCreation and divinity itself\nI have been speaking, for my theme has been\nWhat passed within me. Not of outward things\nDone visibly for other minds, words, signs,\nSymbols or actions, but of my own heart\nHave I been speaking, and my youthful mind.\nO Heavens! how awful is the might of souls,\nAnd what they do within themselves while yet\nThe yoke of earth is new to them, the world\nNothing but a wild field where they were sown. 180\nThis is, in truth, heroic argument,\nThis genuine prowess, which I wished to touch\nWith hand however weak, but in the main\nIt lies far hidden from the reach of words.\nPoints have we all of us within our souls\nWhere all stand single; this I feel, and make\nBreathings for incommunicable powers;\nBut is not each a memory to himself,\nAnd, therefore, now that we must quit this theme,\nI am not heartless, for there's not a man\nThat lives who hath not known his god-like hours,\nAnd feels not what an empire we inherit\nAs natural beings in the strength of Nature.\nBOOK FOURTH\nSUMMER VACATION\nBRIGHT was the summer's noon when quickening steps\nFollowed each other till a dreary moor\nWas crossed, a bare ridge clomb, upon whose top\nStanding alone, as from a rampart's edge,\nI overlooked the bed of Windermere,\nLike a vast river, stretching in the sun.\nWith exultation, at my feet I saw\nLake, islands, promontories, gleaming bays,\nA universe of Nature's fairest forms\nProudly revealed with instantaneous burst,\nMagnificent, and beautiful, and gay.\nI bounded down the hill shouting amain\nFor the old Ferryman; to the shout the rocks\nReplied, and when the Charon of the flood\nHad staid his oars, and touched the jutting pier,\nI did not step into the well-known boat\nWithout a cordial greeting. Thence with speed\nUp the familiar hill I took my way\n\nTowards that sweet Valley where I had been reared;\n'Twas but a short hour's walk, ere veering round 20\nI saw the snow-white church upon her hill\nSit like a throned Lady, sending out\nA gracious look all over her domain.\nYon azure smoke betrays the lurking town;\nWith eager footsteps I advance and reach\nThe cottage threshold where my journey closed.\nGlad welcome had I, with some tears, perhaps,\nFrom my old Dame, so kind and motherly,\nWhile she perused me with a parent's pride.\nThe thoughts of gratitude shall fall like dew\nUpon thy grave, good creature! While my heart\nCan beat never will I forget thy name.\nHeaven's blessing be upon thee where thou liest\nAfter thy innocent and busy stir\nIn narrow cares, thy little daily growth\nOf calm enjoyments, after eighty years,\nAnd more than eighty, of untroubled life;\nChildless, yet by the strangers to thy blood\nHonoured with little less than filial love.\nWhat joy was mine to see thee once again,\nThee and thy dwelling, and a crowd of things\nAbout its narrow precincts all beloved,\nAnd many of them seeming yet my own!\nWhy should I speak of what a thousand hearts\nHave felt, and every man alive can guess?\nThe rooms, the court, the garden were not left\nLong unsaluted, nor the sunny seat\nRound the stone table under the dark pine,\nFriendly to studious or to festive hours;\nNor that unruly child of mountain birth,50\nThe famous brook, who, soon as he was boxed\nWithin our garden, found himself at once,\nAs if by trick insidious and unkind,\nStripped of his voice and left to dimple down\n(Without an effort and without a will)\nA channel paved by man's officious care.\nI looked at him and smiled, and smiled again,\nAnd in the press of twenty thousand thoughts,\n\"Ha,\" quoth I, \"pretty prisoner, are you there!\"\nWell might sarcastic Fancy then have whispered, 60\n\"An emblem here behold of thy own life;\nIn its late course of even days with all\nTheir smooth enthralment;\" but the heart was full,\nToo full for that reproach. My aged Dame\nWalked proudly at my side: she guided me;\nI willing, nay--nay, wishing to be led.\n--The face of every neighbour whom I met\nWas like a volume to me; some were hailed\nUpon the road, some busy at their work,\n\nUnceremonious greetings interchanged 70\nWith half the length of a long field between.\nAmong my schoolfellows I scattered round\nLike recognitions, but with some constraint\nAttended, doubtless, with a little pride,\nBut with more shame, for my habiliments,\nThe transformation wrought by gay attire.\nNot less delighted did I take my place\nAt our domestic table: and, dear Friend!\nIn this endeavour simply to relate\nA Poet's history, may I leave untold 80\nThe thankfulness with which I laid me down\nIn my accustomed bed, more welcome now\nPerhaps than if it had been more desired\nOr been more often thought of with regret;\nThat lowly bed whence I had heard the wind\nRoar, and the rain beat hard; where I so oft\nHad lain awake on summer nights to watch\nThe moon in splendour couched among the leaves\nOf a tall ash, that near our cottage stood;\nHad watched her with fixed eyes while to and fro 90\nIn the dark summit of the waving tree\nShe rocked with every impulse of the breeze.\nAmong the favourites whom it pleased me well\nTo see again, was one by ancient right\nOur inmate, a rough terrier of the hills;\nBy birth and call of nature pre-ordained\nTo hunt the badger and unearth the fox\nAmong the impervious crags, but having been\nFrom youth our own adopted, he had passed\nInto a gentler service. And when first 100\nThe boyish spirit flagged, and day by day\nAlong my veins I kindled with the stir,\nThe fermentation, and the vernal heat\nOf poesy, affecting private shades\nLike a sick Lover, then this dog was used\nTo watch me, an attendant and a friend,\nObsequious to my steps early and late,\nThough often of such dilatory walk\nTired, and uneasy at the halts I made.\nA hundred times when, roving high and low,\nI have been harassed with the toil of verse,\nMuch pains and little progress, and at once\nSome lovely Image in the song rose up\nFull-formed, like Venus rising from the sea;\nThen have I darted forwards to let loose\nMy hand upon his back with stormy joy,\nCaressing him again and yet again.\nAnd when at evening on the public way\nI sauntered, like a river murmuring\n\nAnd talking to itself when all things else\nAre still, the creature trotted on before;\nSuch was his custom; but whene'er he met\nA passenger approaching, he would turn\nTo give me timely notice, and straightway,\nGrateful for that admonishment, I hushed\nMy voice, composed my gait, and, with the air\nAnd mien of one whose thoughts are free, advanced\nTo give and take a greeting that might save\nMy name from piteous rumours, such as wait\nOn men suspected to be crazed in brain.130\nThose walks well worthy to be prized and loved--\nRegretted!--that word, too, was on my tongue,\nBut they were richly laden with all good,\nAnd cannot be remembered but with thanks\nAnd gratitude, and perfect joy of heart-\nme back\nLike a returning Spring. When first I made\nOnce more the circuit of our little lake,\nIf ever happiness hath lodged with man,\nThat day consummate happiness was mine,140\nWide-spreading, steady, calm, contemplative.\nThe sun was set, or setting, when I left\nOur cottage door, and evening soon brought on\nA sober hour, not winning or serene,\nFor cold and raw the air was, and untuned:\nBut as a face we love is sweetest then\nWhen sorrow damps it, or, whatever look\nIt chance to wear, is sweetest if the heart\nHave fulness in herself; even so with me\nIt fared that evening. Gently did my soul\nPut off her veil, and, self-transmuted, stood\nNaked, as in the presence of her God.\nWhile on I walked, a comfort seemed to touch\nA heart that had not been disconsolate:\nStrength came where weakness was not known to be,\nAt least not felt; and restoration came\nLike an intruder knocking at the door\nOf unacknowledged weariness. I took\nThe balance, and with firm hand weighed myself.\n--Of that external scene which round me lay,\nLittle, in this abstraction, did I see;\nRemembered less; but I had inward hopes\nAnd swellings of the spirit, was rapt and soothed,\nConversed with promises, had glimmering views\nHow life pervades the undecaying mind;\nHow the immortal soul with God-like power\nInforms, creates, and thaws the deepest sleep\nThat time can lay upon her; how on earth,\nMan, if he do but live within the light\n\nOf high endeavours, daily spreads abroad\nHis being armed with strength that cannot fail.\nNor was there want of milder thoughts, of love,\nOf innocence, and holiday repose;\nAnd more than pastoral quiet, 'mid the stir\nOf boldest projects, and a peaceful end\nAt last, or glorious, by endurance won.\nThus musing, in a wood I sate me down\nAlone, continuing there to muse: the slopes\nAnd heights meanwhile were slowly overspread\nWith darkness, and before a rippling breeze\nThe long lake lengthened out its hoary line,\nAnd in the sheltered coppice where I sate,\nAround me from among the hazel leaves,\nNow here, now there, moved by the straggling wind,\nCame ever and anon a breath-like sound,\nQuick as the pantings of the faithful dog,\nThe off and on companion of my walk;\nAnd such, at times, believing them to be,\nI turned my head to look if he were there;\nThen into solemn thought I passed once more.\nA freshness also found I at this time\nIn human Life, the daily life of those\nWhose occupations really I loved;\nThe peaceful scene oft filled me with surprise\nChanged like a garden in the heat of spring\nAfter an eight-days' absence. For (to omit\nThe things which were the same and yet appeared\nFar otherwise) amid this rural solitude,\nA narrow Vale where each was known to all,\n'Twas not indifferent to a youthful mind\nTo mark some sheltering bower or sunny nook\nWhere an old man had used to sit alone,\nNow vacant; pale-faced babes whom I had left\nIn arms, now rosy prattlers at the feet\nOf a pleased grandame tottering up and down;\nAnd growing girls whose beauty, filched away\nWith all its pleasant promises, was gone\nTo deck some slighted playmate's homely cheek.\nYes, I had something of a subtler sense,\nAnd often looking round was moved to smiles\nSuch as a delicate work of humour breeds;\nI read, without design, the opinions, thoughts,\nOf those plain-living people now observed\nWith clearer knowledge; with another eye\nI saw the quiet woodman in the woods,\nThe shepherd roam the hills. With new delight,\nThis chiefly, did I note my grey-haired Dame;\nSaw her go forth to church or other work\n\nOf state equipped in monumental trim;\nShort velvet cloak, (her bonnet of the like), 220\nA mantle such as Spanish Cavaliers\nWore in old times. Her smooth domestic life,\nAffectionate without disquietude,\nHer talk, her business, pleased me; and no less\nHer clear though shallow stream of piety\nThat ran on Sabbath days a fresher course;\nWith thoughts unfelt till now I saw her read\nHer Bible on hot Sunday afternoons,\nAnd loved the book, when she had dropped asleep\nAnd made of it a pillow for her head. 230\nNor less do I remember to have felt,\nDistinctly manifested at this time,\nA human-heartedness about my love\nFor objects hitherto the absolute wealth\nOf my own private being and no more;\nWhich I had loved, even as a blessed spirit\nOr Angel, if he were to dwell on earth,\nMight love in individual happiness.\nBut now there opened on me other thoughts\nOf change, congratulation or regret, 240\nA pensive feeling! It spread far and wide;\nThe trees, the mountains shared it, and the brooks,\nThe stars of Heaven, now seen in their old haunts-\nglittering o'er the southern crags,\nOrion with his belt, and those fair Seven,\nAcquaintances of every little child,\nAnd Jupiter, my own beloved star!\nWhatever shadings of mortality,\nWhatever imports from the world of death\nHad come among these objects heretofore,\nWere, in the main, of mood less tender: strong,\nDeep, gloomy were they, and severe; the scatterings\nOf awe or tremulous dread, that had given way\nIn later youth to yearnings of a love\nEnthusiastic, to delight and hope.\nAs one who hangs down-bending from the side\nOf a slow-moving boat, upon the breast\nOf a still water, solacing himself\nWith such discoveries as his eye can make\nBeneath him in the bottom of the deep, 260\nSees many beauteous sights--weeds, fishes, flowers,\nGrots, pebbles, roots of trees, and fancies more,\nYet often is perplexed, and cannot part\nThe shadow from the substance, rocks and sky,\nMountains and clouds, reflected in the depth\nOf the clear flood, from things which there abide\nIn their true dwelling; now is crossed by gleam\n\nOf his own image, by a sunbeam now,\nAnd wavering motions sent he knows not whence,\nImpediments that make his task more sweet;\nSuch pleasant office have we long pursued\nIncumbent o'er the surface of past time\nWith like success, nor often have appeared\nShapes fairer or less doubtfully discerned\nThan these to which the Tale, indulgent Friend!\nWould now direct thy notice. Yet in spite\nOf pleasure won, and knowledge not withheld,\nThere was an inner falling off--I loved,\nLoved deeply all that had been loved before,\nMore deeply even than ever: but a swarm280\nOf heady schemes jostling each other, gawds\nAnd feast and dance, and public revelry,\nAnd sports and games (too grateful in themselves,\nYet in themselves less grateful, I believe,\nThan as they were a badge glossy and fresh\nOf manliness and freedom) all conspired\nTo lure my mind from firm habitual quest\nOf feeding pleasures, to depress the zeal\nAnd damp those yearnings which had once been mine-\nrldly-minded youth, given up\nTo his own eager thoughts. It would demand\nSome skill, and longer time than may be spared\nTo paint these vanities, and how they wrought\nIn haunts where they, till now, had been unknown.\nIt seemed the very garments that I wore\nPreyed on my strength, and stopped the quiet stream\nOf self-forgetfulness.\nYes, that heartless chase\nOf trivial pleasures was a poor exchange\nFor books and nature at that early age.\n'Tis true, some casual knowledge might be gained 300\nOf character or life; but at that time,\nOf manners put to school I took small note,\nAnd all my deeper passions lay elsewhere.\nFar better had it been to exalt the mind\nBy solitary study, to uphold\nIntense desire through meditative peace;\nAnd yet, for chastisement of these regrets,\nThe memory of one particular hour\nDoth here rise up against me. 'Mid a throng\nOf maids and youths, old men, and matrons staid, 310\nA medley of all tempers, I had passed\nThe night in dancing, gaiety, and mirth,\nWith din of instruments and shuffling feet,\nAnd glancing forms, and tapers glittering,\nAnd unaimed prattle flying up and down;\nSpirits upon the stretch, and here and there\nSlight shocks of young love-liking interspersed,\n\nWhose transient pleasure mounted to the head,\nAnd tingled through the veins. Ere we retired,\nThe cock had crowed, and now the eastern sky\nWas kindling, not unseen, from humble copse\nAnd open field, through which the pathway wound,\nAnd homeward led my steps. Magnificent\nThe morning rose, in memorable pomp,\nGlorious as e'er I had beheld--in front,\nThe sea lay laughing at a distance; near,\nThe solid mountains shone, bright as the clouds,\nGrain-tinctured, drenched in empyrean light;\nAnd in the meadows and the lower grounds\nWas all the sweetness of a common dawn--\nDews, vapours, and the melody of birds,\nAnd labourers going forth to till the fields.\nAh! need I say, dear Friend! that to the brim\nMy heart was full; I made no vows, but vows\nWere then made for me; bond unknown to me\nWas given, that I should be, else sinning greatly,\nA dedicated Spirit. On I walked\nIn thankful blessedness, which yet survives.\nStrange rendezvous! My mind was at that time\nA parti-coloured show of grave and gay,340\nSolid and light, short-sighted and profound;\nOf inconsiderate habits and sedate,\nConsorting in one mansion unreproved.\nThe worth I knew of powers that I possessed,\nThough slighted and too oft misused. Besides,\nThat summer, swarming as it did with thoughts\nTransient and idle, lacked not intervals\nWhen Folly from the frown of fleeting Time\nShrunk, and the mind experienced in herself\nConformity as just as that of old\nTo the end and written spirit of God's works,\nWhether held forth in Nature or in Man,\nThrough pregnant vision, separate or conjoined.\nWhen from our better selves we have too long\nBeen parted by the hurrying world, and droop,\nSick of its business, of its pleasures tired,\nHow gracious, how benign, is Solitude;\nHow potent a mere image of her sway;\nMost potent when impressed upon the mind\nWith an appropriate human centre--hermit,\nDeep in the bosom of the wilderness;\nVotary (in vast cathedral, where no foot\nIs treading, where no other face is seen)\nKneeling at prayers; or watchman on the top\nOf lighthouse, beaten by Atlantic waves;\nOr as the soul of that great Power is met\n\nSometimes embodied on a public road,\nWhen, for the night deserted, it assumes\nA character of quiet more profound\nThan pathless wastes.\nOnce, when those summer months\nWere flown, and autumn brought its annual show\nOf oars with oars contending, sails with sails,\nUpon Winander's spacious breast, it chanced\nThat--after I had left a flower-decked room\n(Whose in-door pastime, lighted up, survived\nTo a late hour), and spirits overwrought\nWere making night do penance for a day\nSpent in a round of strenuous idleness-\nMy homeward course led up a long ascent,\nWhere the road's watery surface, to the top\nOf that sharp rising, glittered to the moon\nAnd bore the semblance of another stream\nStealing with silent lapse to join the brook\nThat murmured in the vale. All else was still;\nNo living thing appeared in earth or air,\nAnd, save the flowing water's peaceful voice,\nSound there was none--but, lo! an uncouth shape,\nShown by a sudden turning of the road,\nSo near that, slipping back into the shade\nOf a thick hawthorn, I could mark him well,\nMyself unseen. He was of stature tall,\nA span above man's common measure, tall,\nStiff, lank, and upright; a more meagre man\nWas never seen before by night or day.\nLong were his arms, pallid his hands; his mouth\nLooked ghastly in the moonlight: from behind,\nA mile-stone propped him; I could also ken\nThat he was clothed in military garb,\nThough faded, yet entire. Companionless,\nNo dog attending, by no staff sustained,\nHe stood, and in his very dress appeared\nA desolation, a simplicity,\nTo which the trappings of a gaudy world\nMake a strange back-ground. From his lips, ere long,\nIssued low muttered sounds, as if of pain\nOr some uneasy thought; yet still his form\nKept the same awful steadiness--at his feet\nHis shadow lay, and moved not. From self-blame\nNot wholly free, I watched him thus; at length\nSubduing my heart's specious cowardice,410\nI left the shady nook where I had stood\nAnd hailed him. Slowly from his resting-place\nHe rose, and with a lean and wasted arm\nIn measured gesture lifted to his head\nReturned my salutation; then resumed\nHis station as before; and when I asked\n\nHis history, the veteran, in reply,\nWas neither slow nor eager; but, unmoved,\nAnd with a quiet uncomplaining voice,\nA stately air of mild indifference, 420\nHe told in few plain words a soldier's tale-\nopic Islands he had served,\nWhence he had landed scarcely three weeks past;\nThat on his landing he had been dismissed,\nAnd now was travelling towards his native home.\nThis heard, I said, in pity, \"Come with me.\"\nHe stooped, and straightway from the ground took up\nAn oaken staff by me yet unobserved-\nmust have dropped from his slack hand\nAnd lay till now neglected in the grass.\nThough weak his step and cautious, he appeared\nTo travel without pain, and I beheld,\nWith an astonishment but ill suppressed,\nHis ghostly figure moving at my side;\nNor could I, while we journeyed thus, forbear\nTo turn from present hardships to the past,\nAnd speak of war, battle, and pestilence,\nSprinkling this talk with questions, better spared,\nOn what he might himself have seen or felt.\nHe all the while was in demeanour calm,440\nConcise in answer; solemn and sublime\nHe might have seemed, but that in all he said\nThere was a strange half-absence, as of one\nKnowing too well the importance of his theme,\nBut feeling it no longer. Our discourse\nSoon ended, and together on we passed\nIn silence through a wood gloomy and still.\nUp-turning, then, along an open field,\nWe reached a cottage. At the door I knocked,\nAnd earnestly to charitable care\nCommended him as a poor friendless man,\nBelated and by sickness overcome.\nAssured that now the traveller would repose\nIn comfort, I entreated that henceforth\nHe would not linger in the public ways,\nBut ask for timely furtherance and help\nSuch as his state required. At this reproof,\nWith the same ghastly mildness in his look,\nHe said, \"My trust is in the God of Heaven,\nAnd in the eye of him who passes me!\" 460\nThe cottage door was speedily unbarred,\nAnd now the soldier touched his hat once more\nWith his lean hand, and in a faltering voice,\nWhose tone bespake reviving interests\nTill then unfelt, he thanked me; I returned\nThe farewell blessing of the patient man,\n\nAnd so we parted. Back I cast a look,\nAnd lingered near the door a little space,\nThen sought with quiet heart my distant home.\nBOOK FOURTH\nSUMMER VACATION\nBRIGHT was the summer's noon when quickening steps\nFollowed each other till a dreary moor\nWas crossed, a bare ridge clomb, upon whose top\nStanding alone, as from a rampart's edge,\nI overlooked the bed of Windermere,\nLike a vast river, stretching in the sun.\nWith exultation, at my feet I saw\nLake, islands, promontories, gleaming bays,\nA universe of Nature's fairest forms\nProudly revealed with instantaneous burst,\nMagnificent, and beautiful, and gay.\nI bounded down the hill shouting amain\nFor the old Ferryman; to the shout the rocks\nReplied, and when the Charon of the flood\nHad staid his oars, and touched the jutting pier,\nI did not step into the well-known boat\nWithout a cordial greeting. Thence with speed\nUp the familiar hill I took my way\nTowards that sweet Valley where I had been reared;\n'Twas but a short hour's walk, ere veering round 20\nI saw the snow-white church upon her hill\nSit like a throned Lady, sending out\nA gracious look all over her domain.\nYon azure smoke betrays the lurking town;\nWith eager footsteps I advance and reach\nThe cottage threshold where my journey closed.\nGlad welcome had I, with some tears, perhaps,\nFrom my old Dame, so kind and motherly,\nWhile she perused me with a parent's pride.\nThe thoughts of gratitude shall fall like dew\nUpon thy grave, good creature! While my heart\nCan beat never will I forget thy name.\nHeaven's blessing be upon thee where thou liest\nAfter thy innocent and busy stir\nIn narrow cares, thy little daily growth\nOf calm enjoyments, after eighty years,\nAnd more than eighty, of untroubled life;\nChildless, yet by the strangers to thy blood\nHonoured with little less than filial love.\nWhat joy was mine to see thee once again,\nThee and thy dwelling, and a crowd of things\nAbout its narrow precincts all beloved,\n\nAnd many of them seeming yet my own!\nWhy should I speak of what a thousand hearts\nHave felt, and every man alive can guess?\nThe rooms, the court, the garden were not left\nLong unsaluted, nor the sunny seat\nRound the stone table under the dark pine,\nFriendly to studious or to festive hours;\nNor that unruly child of mountain birth,50\nThe famous brook, who, soon as he was boxed\nWithin our garden, found himself at once,\nAs if by trick insidious and unkind,\nStripped of his voice and left to dimple down\n(Without an effort and without a will)\nA channel paved by man's officious care.\nI looked at him and smiled, and smiled again,\nAnd in the press of twenty thousand thoughts,\n\"Ha,\" quoth I, \"pretty prisoner, are you there!\"\nWell might sarcastic Fancy then have whispered, 60\n\"An emblem here behold of thy own life;\nIn its late course of even days with all\nTheir smooth enthralment;\" but the heart was full,\nToo full for that reproach. My aged Dame\nWalked proudly at my side: she guided me;\nI willing, nay--nay, wishing to be led.\n--The face of every neighbour whom I met\nWas like a volume to me; some were hailed\nUpon the road, some busy at their work,\nUnceremonious greetings interchanged 70\nWith half the length of a long field between.\nAmong my schoolfellows I scattered round\nLike recognitions, but with some constraint\nAttended, doubtless, with a little pride,\nBut with more shame, for my habiliments,\nThe transformation wrought by gay attire.\nNot less delighted did I take my place\nAt our domestic table: and, dear Friend!\nIn this endeavour simply to relate\nA Poet's history, may I leave untold 80\nThe thankfulness with which I laid me down\nIn my accustomed bed, more welcome now\nPerhaps than if it had been more desired\nOr been more often thought of with regret;\nThat lowly bed whence I had heard the wind\nRoar, and the rain beat hard; where I so oft\nHad lain awake on summer nights to watch\nThe moon in splendour couched among the leaves\nOf a tall ash, that near our cottage stood;\nHad watched her with fixed eyes while to and fro 90\nIn the dark summit of the waving tree\nShe rocked with every impulse of the breeze.\n\nAmong the favourites whom it pleased me well\nTo see again, was one by ancient right\nOur inmate, a rough terrier of the hills;\nBy birth and call of nature pre-ordained\nTo hunt the badger and unearth the fox\nAmong the impervious crags, but having been\nFrom youth our own adopted, he had passed\nInto a gentler service. And when first 100\nThe boyish spirit flagged, and day by day\nAlong my veins I kindled with the stir,\nThe fermentation, and the vernal heat\nOf poesy, affecting private shades\nLike a sick Lover, then this dog was used\nTo watch me, an attendant and a friend,\nObsequious to my steps early and late,\nThough often of such dilatory walk\nTired, and uneasy at the halts I made.\nA hundred times when, roving high and low,\nI have been harassed with the toil of verse,\nMuch pains and little progress, and at once\nSome lovely Image in the song rose up\nFull-formed, like Venus rising from the sea;\nThen have I darted forwards to let loose\nMy hand upon his back with stormy joy,\nCaressing him again and yet again.\nAnd when at evening on the public way\nI sauntered, like a river murmuring\nAnd talking to itself when all things else\nAre still, the creature trotted on before;\nSuch was his custom; but whene'er he met\nA passenger approaching, he would turn\nTo give me timely notice, and straightway,\nGrateful for that admonishment, I hushed\nMy voice, composed my gait, and, with the air\nAnd mien of one whose thoughts are free, advanced\nTo give and take a greeting that might save\nMy name from piteous rumours, such as wait\nOn men suspected to be crazed in brain.130\nThose walks well worthy to be prized and loved--\nRegretted!--that word, too, was on my tongue,\nBut they were richly laden with all good,\nAnd cannot be remembered but with thanks\nAnd gratitude, and perfect joy of heart-\nThose walks in all their freshness now came back\nLike a returning Spring. When first I made\nOnce more the circuit of our little lake,\nIf ever happiness hath lodged with man,\nThat day consummate happiness was mine,140\nWide-spreading, steady, calm, contemplative.\nThe sun was set, or setting, when I left\n\nOur cottage door, and evening soon brought on\nA sober hour, not winning or serene,\nFor cold and raw the air was, and untuned:\nBut as a face we love is sweetest then\nWhen sorrow damps it, or, whatever look\nIt chance to wear, is sweetest if the heart\nHave fulness in herself; even so with me\nIt fared that evening. Gently did my soul\nPut off her veil, and, self-transmuted, stood\nNaked, as in the presence of her God.\nWhile on I walked, a comfort seemed to touch\nA heart that had not been disconsolate:\nStrength came where weakness was not known to be,\nAt least not felt; and restoration came\nLike an intruder knocking at the door\nOf unacknowledged weariness. I took\nThe balance, and with firm hand weighed myself.\n--Of that external scene which round me lay,\nLittle, in this abstraction, did I see;\nRemembered less; but I had inward hopes\nAnd swellings of the spirit, was rapt and soothed,\nConversed with promises, had glimmering views\nHow life pervades the undecaying mind;\nHow the immortal soul with God-like power\nInforms, creates, and thaws the deepest sleep\nThat time can lay upon her; how on earth,\nMan, if he do but live within the light\nOf high endeavours, daily spreads abroad\nHis being armed with strength that cannot fail.\nNor was there want of milder thoughts, of love,\nOf innocence, and holiday repose;\nAnd more than pastoral quiet, 'mid the stir\nOf boldest projects, and a peaceful end\nAt last, or glorious, by endurance won.\nThus musing, in a wood I sate me down\nAlone, continuing there to muse: the slopes\nAnd heights meanwhile were slowly overspread\nWith darkness, and before a rippling breeze\nThe long lake lengthened out its hoary line,\nAnd in the sheltered coppice where I sate,\nAround me from among the hazel leaves,\nNow here, now there, moved by the straggling wind,\nCame ever and anon a breath-like sound,\nQuick as the pantings of the faithful dog,\nThe off and on companion of my walk;\nAnd such, at times, believing them to be,\nI turned my head to look if he were there;\nThen into solemn thought I passed once more.\nA freshness also found I at this time\nIn human Life, the daily life of those\n\nWhose occupations really I loved;\nThe peaceful scene oft filled me with surprise\nChanged like a garden in the heat of spring\nAfter an eight-days' absence. For (to omit\nThe things which were the same and yet appeared\nFar otherwise) amid this rural solitude,\nA narrow Vale where each was known to all,\n'Twas not indifferent to a youthful mind\nTo mark some sheltering bower or sunny nook\nWhere an old man had used to sit alone,\nNow vacant; pale-faced babes whom I had left\nIn arms, now rosy prattlers at the feet\nOf a pleased grandame tottering up and down;\nAnd growing girls whose beauty, filched away\nWith all its pleasant promises, was gone\nTo deck some slighted playmate's homely cheek.\nYes, I had something of a subtler sense,\nAnd often looking round was moved to smiles\nSuch as a delicate work of humour breeds;\nI read, without design, the opinions, thoughts,\nOf those plain-living people now observed\nWith clearer knowledge; with another eye\nI saw the quiet woodman in the woods,\nThe shepherd roam the hills. With new delight,\nThis chiefly, did I note my grey-haired Dame;\nSaw her go forth to church or other work\nOf state equipped in monumental trim;\nShort velvet cloak, (her bonnet of the like), 220\nA mantle such as Spanish Cavaliers\nWore in old times. Her smooth domestic life,\nAffectionate without disquietude,\nHer talk, her business, pleased me; and no less\nHer clear though shallow stream of piety\nThat ran on Sabbath days a fresher course;\nWith thoughts unfelt till now I saw her read\nHer Bible on hot Sunday afternoons,\nAnd loved the book, when she had dropped asleep\nAnd made of it a pillow for her head. 230\nNor less do I remember to have felt,\nDistinctly manifested at this time,\nA human-heartedness about my love\nFor objects hitherto the absolute wealth\nOf my own private being and no more;\nWhich I had loved, even as a blessed spirit\nOr Angel, if he were to dwell on earth,\nMight love in individual happiness.\nBut now there opened on me other thoughts\nOf change, congratulation or regret, 240\nA pensive feeling! It spread far and wide;\n\nThe trees, the mountains shared it, and the brooks,\nThe stars of Heaven, now seen in their old haunts-\nglittering o'er the southern crags,\nOrion with his belt, and those fair Seven,\nAcquaintances of every little child,\nAnd Jupiter, my own beloved star!\nWhatever shadings of mortality,\nWhatever imports from the world of death\nHad come among these objects heretofore,\nWere, in the main, of mood less tender: strong,\nDeep, gloomy were they, and severe; the scatterings\nOf awe or tremulous dread, that had given way\nIn later youth to yearnings of a love\nEnthusiastic, to delight and hope.\nAs one who hangs down-bending from the side\nOf a slow-moving boat, upon the breast\nOf a still water, solacing himself\nWith such discoveries as his eye can make\nBeneath him in the bottom of the deep, 260\nSees many beauteous sights--weeds, fishes, flowers,\nGrots, pebbles, roots of trees, and fancies more,\nYet often is perplexed, and cannot part\nThe shadow from the substance, rocks and sky,\nMountains and clouds, reflected in the depth\nOf the clear flood, from things which there abide\nIn their true dwelling; now is crossed by gleam\nOf his own image, by a sunbeam now,\nAnd wavering motions sent he knows not whence,\nImpediments that make his task more sweet;\nSuch pleasant office have we long pursued\nIncumbent o'er the surface of past time\nWith like success, nor often have appeared\nShapes fairer or less doubtfully discerned\nThan these to which the Tale, indulgent Friend!\nWould now direct thy notice. Yet in spite\nOf pleasure won, and knowledge not withheld,\nThere was an inner falling off--I loved,\nLoved deeply all that had been loved before,\nMore deeply even than ever: but a swarm280\nOf heady schemes jostling each other, gawds\nAnd feast and dance, and public revelry,\nAnd sports and games (too grateful in themselves,\nYet in themselves less grateful, I believe,\nThan as they were a badge glossy and fresh\nOf manliness and freedom) all conspired\nTo lure my mind from firm habitual quest\nOf feeding pleasures, to depress the zeal\nAnd damp those yearnings which had once been mine-\nrldly-minded youth, given up\nTo his own eager thoughts.

At the door I knocked,\nAnd earnestly to charitable care\nCommended him as a poor friendless man,\nBelated and by sickness overcome.\nAssured that now the traveller would repose\nIn comfort, I entreated that henceforth\nHe would not linger in the public ways,\nBut ask for timely furtherance and help\nSuch as his state required. At this reproof,\nWith the same ghastly mildness in his look,\nHe said, \"My trust is in the God of Heaven,\nAnd in the eye of him who passes me!\" 460\nThe cottage door was speedily unbarred,\nAnd now the soldier touched his hat once more\nWith his lean hand, and in a faltering voice,\nWhose tone bespake reviving interests\nTill then unfelt, he thanked me; I returned\nThe farewell blessing of the patient man,\nAnd so we parted. Back I cast a look,\nAnd lingered near the door a little space,\nThen sought with quiet heart my distant home.\n.\n.\n.\nThere was a boy: ye knew him well, ye cliffs\nAnd islands of Winander!--many a time\nAt evening, when the earliest stars began\nTo move along the edges of the hills,\nRising or setting, would he stand alone\nBeneath the trees or by the glimmering lake,\nAnd there, with fingers interwoven, both hands 370\nPressed closely palm to palm, and to his mouth\nUplifted, he, as through an instrument,\nBlew mimic hootings to the silent owls,\nThat they might answer him; and they would shout\nAcross the watery vale, and shout again,\nResponsive to his call, with quivering peals,\nAnd long halloos and screams, and echoes loud,\nRedoubled and redoubled, concourse wild\nOf jocund din; and, when a lengthened pause\nOf silence came and baffled his best skill,\nThen sometimes, in that silence while he hung\nListening, a gentle shock of mild surprise\n\nHas carried far into his heart the voice\nOf mountain torrents; or the visible scene\nWould enter unawares into his mind,\nWith all its solemn imagery, its rocks,\nIts woods, and that uncertain heaven, received\nInto the bosom of the steady lake.\nThis Boy was taken from his mates, and died\nIn childhood, ere he was full twelve years old. 390\nFair is the spot, most beautiful the vale\nWhere he was born; the grassy churchyard hangs\nUpon a slope above the village school,\nAnd through that churchyard when my way has led\nOn summer evenings, I believe that there\nA long half hour together I have stood\nMute, looking at the grave in which he lies!\nEven now appears before the mind's clear eye\nThat self-same village church; I see her sit\n(The throned Lady whom erewhile we hailed)\nOn her green hill, forgetful of this Boy\nWho slumbers at her feet,--forgetful, too,\nOf all her silent neighbourhood of graves,\nAnd listening only to the gladsome sounds\nThat, from the rural school ascending, play\nBeneath her and about her. May she long\nBehold a race of young ones like to those\nWith whom I herded!--(easily, indeed,\nWe might have fed upon a fatter soil\nOf arts and letters--but be that forgiven)--\nA race of real children; not too wise,\nToo learned, or too good; but wanton, fresh,\nAnd bandied up and down by love and hate;\nNot unresentful where self-justified;\nFierce, moody, patient, venturous, modest, shy;\nMad at their sports like withered leaves in winds;\nThough doing wrong and suffering, and full oft\nBending beneath our life's mysterious weight\nOf pain, and doubt, and fear, yet yielding not\nIn happiness to the happiest upon earth.\nSimplicity in habit, truth in speech,\nBe these the daily strengtheners of their minds;\nMay books and Nature be their early joy!\nAnd knowledge, rightly honoured with that name-\nby the loss of power!\nWell do I call to mind the very week\nWhen I was first intrusted to the care\nOf that sweet Valley; when its paths, its shores,\nAnd brooks were like a dream of novelty\nTo my half-infant thoughts; that very week,\nWhile I was roving up and down alone,\n\nSeeking I knew not what, I chanced to cross\nOne of those open fields, which, shaped like ears,\nMake green peninsulas on Esthwaite's Lake:\nTwilight was coming on, yet through the gloom\nAppeared distinctly on the opposite shore\nA heap of garments, as if left by one\nWho might have there been bathing. Long I watched,\nBut no one owned them; meanwhile the calm lake\nGrew dark with all the shadows on its breast, 440\nAnd, now and then, a fish up-leaping snapped\nThe breathless stillness. The succeeding day,\nThose unclaimed garments telling a plain tale\nDrew to the spot an anxious crowd; some looked\nIn passive expectation from the shore,\nWhile from a boat others hung o'er the deep,\nSounding with grappling irons and long poles.\nAt last, the dead man, 'mid that beauteous scene\nOf trees and hills and water, bolt upright\nRose, with his ghastly face, a spectre shape\nOf terror; yet no soul-debasing fear,\nYoung as I was, a child not nine years old,\nPossessed me, for my inner eye had seen\nSuch sights before, among the shining streams\nOf faery land, the forest of romance.\nTheir spirit hallowed the sad spectacle\nWith decoration of ideal grace;\nA dignity, a smoothness, like the works\nOf Grecian art, and purest poesy.\nA precious treasure had I long possessed,\nA little yellow, canvas-covered book,\nA slender abstract of the Arabian tales;\nAnd, from companions in a new abode,\nWhen first I learnt, that this dear prize of mine\nWas but a block hewn from a mighty quarry-\nes, laden all\nWith kindred matter, 'twas to me, in truth,\nA promise scarcely earthly. Instantly,\nWith one not richer than myself, I made\nA covenant that each should lay aside 470\nThe moneys he possessed, and hoard up more,\nTill our joint savings had amassed enough\nTo make this book our own. Through several months,\nIn spite of all temptation, we preserved\nReligiously that vow; but firmness failed,\nNor were we ever masters of our wish.\nAnd when thereafter to my father's house\nThe holidays returned me, there to find\nThat golden store of books which I had left,\nWhat joy was mine! How often in the course\n\nOf those glad respites, though a soft west wind\nRuffled the waters to the angler's wish,\nFor a whole day together, have I lain\nDown by thy side, O Derwent! murmuring stream,\nOn the hot stones, and in the glaring sun,\nAnd there have read, devouring as I read,\nDefrauding the day's glory, desperate!\nTill with a sudden bound of smart reproach,\nSuch as an idler deals with in his shame,\nI to the sport betook myself again. 490\nA gracious spirit o'er this earth presides,\nAnd o'er the heart of man; invisibly\nIt comes, to works of unreproved delight,\nAnd tendency benign, directing those\nWho care not, know not, think not, what they do.\nThe tales that charm away the wakeful night\nIn Araby, romances; legends penned\nFor solace by dim light of monkish lamps;\nFictions, for ladies of their love, devised\nBy youthful squires; adventures endless, spun 500\nBy the dismantled warrior in old age,\nOut of the bowels of those very schemes\nIn which his youth did first extravagate;\nThese spread like day, and something in the shape\nOf these will live till man shall be no more.\nDumb yearnings, hidden appetites, are ours,\nAnd 'they must' have their food. Our childhood sits,\nOur simple childhood, sits upon a throne\nThat hath more power than all the elements.\nI guess not what this tells of Being past,\nNor what it augurs of the life to come;\nBut so it is; and, in that dubious hour-\nt begin to see\nThis dawning earth, to recognise, expect,\nAnd, in the long probation that ensues,\nThe time of trial, ere we learn to live\nIn reconcilement with our stinted powers;\nTo endure this state of meagre vassalage,\nUnwilling to forego, confess, submit,\nUneasy and unsettled, yoke-fellows\nTo custom, mettlesome, and not yet tamed\nAnd humbled down--oh! then we feel, we feel,\nWe know where we have friends. Ye dreamers, then,\nForgers of daring tales! we bless you then,\nImpostors, drivellers, dotards, as the ape\nPhilosophy will call you: 'then' we feel\nWith what, and how great might ye are in league,\nWho make our wish, our power, our thought a deed,\nAn empire, a possession,--ye whom time\nAnd seasons serve; all Faculties to whom\n\nEarth crouches, the elements are potter's clay,\nSpace like a heaven filled up with northern lights,\nHere, nowhere, there, and everywhere at once.\n.\n.\n.\nHere must we pause: this only let me add,\nFrom heart-experience, and in humblest sense\nOf modesty, that he, who in his youth\nA daily wanderer among woods and fields\nWith living Nature hath been intimate,\nNot only in that raw unpractised time\nIs stirred to ecstasy, as others are, 590\nBy glittering verse; but further, doth receive,\nIn measure only dealt out to himself,\nKnowledge and increase of enduring joy\nFrom the great Nature that exists in works\nOf mighty Poets. Visionary power\nAttends the motions of the viewless winds,\nEmbodied in the mystery of words:\nThere, darkness makes abode, and all the host\nOf shadowy things work endless changes,--there,\nAs in a mansion like their proper home,600\nEven forms and substances are circumfused\nBy that transparent veil with light divine,\nAnd, through the turnings intricate of verse,\nPresent themselves as objects recognised,\nIn flashes, and with glory not their own.\nBOOK SIXTH\nCAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS\nWhen the third summer freed us from restraint,\nA youthful friend, he too a mountaineer,\nNot slow to share my wishes, took his staff,\nAnd sallying forth, we journeyed side by side,\nBound to the distant Alps. A hardy slight,\nDid this unprecedented course imply,\nOf college studies and their set rewards;\nNor had, in truth, the scheme been formed by me\nWithout uneasy forethought of the pain,330\nThe censures, and ill-omening, of those\nTo whom my worldly interests were dear.\nBut Nature then was sovereign in my mind,\nAnd mighty forms, seizing a youthful fancy,\nHad given a charter to irregular hopes.\nIn any age of uneventful calm\nAmong the nations, surely would my heart\nHave been possessed by similar desire;\nBut Europe at that time was thrilled with joy,\nFrance standing on the top of golden hours,\n\nAnd human nature seeming born again.\nLightly equipped, and but a few brief looks\nCast on the white cliffs of our native shore\nFrom the receding vessel's deck, we chanced\nTo land at Calais on the very eve\nOf that great federal day; and there we saw,\nIn a mean city, and among a few,\nHow bright a face is worn when joy of one\nIs joy for tens of millions. Southward thence\nWe held our way, direct through hamlets, towns, 350\nGaudy with reliques of that festival,\nFlowers left to wither on triumphal arcs,\nAnd window-garlands. On the public roads,\nAnd, once, three days successively, through paths\nBy which our toilsome journey was abridged,\nAmong sequestered villages we walked\nAnd found benevolence and blessedness\nSpread like a fragrance everywhere, when spring\nHath left no corner of the land untouched;\nWhere elms for many and many a league in files 360\nWith their thin umbrage, on the stately roads\nOf that great kingdom, rustled o'er our heads,\nFor ever near us as we paced along:\nHow sweet at such a time, with such delight\nOn every side, in prime of youthful strength,\nTo feed a Poet's tender melancholy\nAnd fond conceit of sadness, with the sound\nOf undulations varying as might please\nThe wind that swayed them; once, and more than once,\nUnhoused beneath the evening star we saw\nDances of liberty, and, in late hours\nOf darkness, dances in the open air\nDeftly prolonged, though grey-haired lookers on\nMight waste their breath in chiding.\nUnder hills-\nThe vine-clad hills and slopes of Burgundy,\nUpon the bosom of the gentle Saone\nWe glided forward with the flowing stream.\nSwift Rhone! thou wert the 'wings' on which we cut\nA winding passage with majestic ease\nBetween thy lofty rocks. Enchanting show\nThose woods and farms and orchards did present,\nAnd single cottages and lurking towns,\nReach after reach, succession without end\nOf deep and stately vales! A lonely pair\nOf strangers, till day closed, we sailed along\nClustered together with a merry crowd\nOf those emancipated, a blithe host\nOf travellers, chiefly delegates, returning\nFrom the great spousals newly solemnised\n\nAt their chief city, in the sight of Heaven.\nLike bees they swarmed, gaudy and gay as bees;\nSome vapoured in the unruliness of joy,\nAnd with their swords flourished as if to fight\nThe saucy air. In this proud company\nWe landed--took with them our evening meal,\nGuests welcome almost as the angels were\nTo Abraham of old. The supper done,\nWith flowing cups elate and happy thoughts\nWe rose at signal given, and formed a ring\nAnd, hand in hand, danced round and round the board;\nAll hearts were open, every tongue was loud\nWith amity and glee; we bore a name\nHonoured in France, the name of Englishmen,\nAnd hospitably did they give us hail,\nAs their forerunners in a glorious course;\nAnd round and round the board we danced again.\nWith these blithe friends our voyage we renewed\nAt early dawn. The monastery bells\nMade a sweet jingling in our youthful ears;\nThe rapid river flowing without noise, 410\nAnd each uprising or receding spire\nSpake with a sense of peace, at intervals\nTouching the heart amid the boisterous crew\nBy whom we were encompassed. Taking leave\nOf this glad throng, foot-travellers side by side,\nMeasuring our steps in quiet, we pursued\nOur journey, and ere twice the sun had set\nBeheld the Convent of Chartreuse, and there\nRested within an awful 'solitude':\nYes, for even then no other than a place\nOf soul-affecting 'solitude' appeared\nThat far-famed region, though our eyes had seen,\nAs toward the sacred mansion we advanced,\nArms flashing, and a military glare\nOf riotous men commissioned to expel\nThe blameless inmates, and belike subvert\nThat frame of social being, which so long\nHad bodied forth the ghostliness of things\nIn silence visible and perpetual calm.\n--\"Stay, stay your sacrilegious hands!\"--The voice\nWas Nature's, uttered from her Alpine throne;\nI heard it then and seem to hear it now-\npious work forbear, perish what may,\nLet this one temple last, be this one spot\nOf earth devoted to eternity!\"\nShe ceased to speak, but while St. Bruno's pines\nWaved their dark tops, not silent as they waved,\nAnd while below, along their several beds,\nMurmured the sister streams of Life and Death,\nThus by conflicting passions pressed, my heart 440\n\nResponded; \"Honour to the patriot's zeal!\nGlory and hope to new-born Liberty!\nHail to the mighty projects of the time!\nDiscerning sword that Justice wields, do thou\nGo forth and prosper; and, ye purging fires,\nUp to the loftiest towers of Pride ascend,\nFanned by the breath of angry Providence.\nBut oh! if Past and Future be the wings\nOn whose support harmoniously conjoined\nMoves the great spirit of human knowledge, spare 450\nThese courts of mystery, where a step advanced\nBetween the portals of the shadowy rocks\nLeaves far behind life's treacherous vanities,\nFor penitential tears and trembling hopes\nExchanged--to equalise in God's pure sight\nMonarch and peasant: be the house redeemed\nWith its unworldly votaries, for the sake\nOf conquest over sense, hourly achieved\nThrough faith and meditative reason, resting\nUpon the word of heaven-imparted truth,460\nCalmly triumphant; and for humbler claim\nOf that imaginative impulse sent\nFrom these majestic floods, yon shining cliffs,\nThe untransmuted shapes of many worlds,\nCerulean ether's pure inhabitants,\nThese forests unapproachable by death,\nThat shall endure as long as man endures,\nTo think, to hope, to worship, and to feel,\nTo struggle, to be lost within himself\nIn trepidation, from the blank abyss 470\nTo look with bodily eyes, and be consoled.\"\nNot seldom since that moment have I wished\nThat thou, O Friend! the trouble or the calm\nHadst shared, when, from profane regards apart,\nIn sympathetic reverence we trod\nThe floors of those dim cloisters, till that hour,\nFrom their foundation, strangers to the presence\nOf unrestricted and unthinking man.\nAbroad, how cheeringly the sunshine lay\nUpon the open lawns! Vallombre's groves480\nEntering, we fed the soul with darkness; thence\nIssued, and with uplifted eyes beheld,\nIn different quarters of the bending sky,\nThe cross of Jesus stand erect, as if\nHands of angelic powers had fixed it there,\nMemorial reverenced by a thousand storms;\nYet then, from the undiscriminating sweep\nAnd rage of one State-whirlwind, insecure.\n'Tis not my present purpose to retrace\nThat variegated journey step by step. 490\n\nA march it was of military speed,\nAnd Earth did change her images and forms\nBefore us, fast as clouds are changed in heaven.\nDay after day, up early and down late,\nFrom hill to vale we dropped, from vale to hill\nMounted--from province on to province swept,\nKeen hunters in a chase of fourteen weeks,\nEager as birds of prey, or as a ship\nUpon the stretch, when winds are blowing fair:\nSweet coverts did we cross of pastoral life,\nEnticing valleys, greeted them and left\nToo soon, while yet the very flash and gleam\nOf salutation were not passed away.\nOh! sorrow for the youth who could have seen,\nUnchastened, unsubdued, unawed, unraised\nTo patriarchal dignity of mind,\nAnd pure simplicity of wish and will,\nThose sanctified abodes of peaceful man,\nPleased (though to hardship born, and compassed round\nWith danger, varying as the seasons change),\nPleased with his daily task, or, if not pleased,\nContented, from the moment that the dawn\n(Ah! surely not without attendant gleams\nOf soul-illumination) calls him forth\nTo industry, by glistenings flung on rocks,\nWhose evening shadows lead him to repose.\nWell might a stranger look with bounding heart\nDown on a green recess, the first I saw\nOf those deep haunts, an aboriginal vale,\nQuiet and lorded over and possessed 520\nBy naked huts, wood-built, and sown like tents\nOr Indian cabins over the fresh lawns\nAnd by the river side.\nThat very day,\nFrom a bare ridge we also first beheld\nUnveiled the summit of Mont Blanc, and grieved\nTo have a soulless image on the eye\nThat had usurped upon a living thought\nThat never more could be. The wondrous Vale\nOf Chamouny stretched far below, and soon\nWith its dumb cataracts and streams of ice,\nA motionless array of mighty waves,\nFive rivers broad and vast, made rich amends,\nAnd reconciled us to realities;\nThere small birds warble from the leafy trees,\nThe eagle soars high in the element,\nThere doth the reaper bind the yellow sheaf,\nThe maiden spread the haycock in the sun,\nWhile Winter like a well-tamed lion walks,\nDescending from the mountain to make sport\n\nAmong the cottages by beds of flowers. 540\nWhate'er in this wide circuit we beheld,\nOr heard, was fitted to our unripe state\nOf intellect and heart. With such a book\nBefore our eyes, we could not choose but read\nLessons of genuine brotherhood, the plain\nAnd universal reason of mankind,\nThe truths of young and old. Nor, side by side\nPacing, two social pilgrims, or alone\nEach with his humour, could we fail to abound\nIn dreams and fictions, pensively composed:\nDejection taken up for pleasure's sake,\nAnd gilded sympathies, the willow wreath,\nAnd sober posies of funereal flowers,\nGathered among those solitudes sublime\nFrom formal gardens of the lady Sorrow,\nDid sweeten many a meditative hour.\nYet still in me with those soft luxuries\nMixed something of stern mood, an underthirst\nOf vigour seldom utterly allayed:\nAnd from that source how different a sadness\nWould issue, let one incident make known.\nWhen from the Vallais we had turned, and clomb\nAlong the Simplon's steep and rugged road,\nFollowing a band of muleteers, we reached\nA halting-place, where all together took\nTheir noon-tide meal. Hastily rose our guide,\nLeaving us at the board; awhile we lingered,\nThen paced the beaten downward way that led\nRight to a rough stream's edge, and there broke off;\nThe only track now visible was one\nThat from the torrent's further brink held forth\nConspicuous invitation to ascend\nA lofty mountain. After brief delay\nCrossing the unbridged stream, that road we took,\nAnd clomb with eagerness, till anxious fears\nIntruded, for we failed to overtake\nOur comrades gone before. By fortunate chance,\nWhile every moment added doubt to doubt,\nA peasant met us, from whose mouth we learned\nThat to the spot which had perplexed us first 580\nWe must descend, and there should find the road,\nWhich in the stony channel of the stream\nLay a few steps, and then along its banks;\nAnd, that our future course, all plain to sight,\nWas downwards, with the current of that stream.\nLoth to believe what we so grieved to hear,\nFor still we had hopes that pointed to the clouds,\nWe questioned him again, and yet again;\n\nBut every word that from the peasant's lips\nCame in reply, translated by our feelings,\nEnded in this,--'that we had crossed the Alps'.\nImagination--here the Power so called\nThrough sad incompetence of human speech,\nThat awful Power rose from the mind's abyss\nLike an unfathered vapour that enwraps,\nAt once, some lonely traveller. I was lost;\nHalted without an effort to break through;\nBut to my conscious soul I now can say-\n\"I recognise thy glory:\" in such strength\nOf usurpation, when the light of sense 600\nGoes out, but with a flash that has revealed\nThe invisible world, doth greatness make abode,\nThere harbours; whether we be young or old,\nOur destiny, our being's heart and home,\nIs with infinitude, and only there;\nWith hope it is, hope that can never die,\nEffort, and expectation, and desire,\nAnd something evermore about to be.\nUnder such banners militant, the soul\nSeeks for no trophies, struggles for no spoils\nThat may attest her prowess, blest in thoughts\nThat are their own perfection and reward,\nStrong in herself and in beatitude\nThat hides her, like the mighty flood of Nile\nPoured from his fount of Abyssinian clouds\nTo fertilise the whole Egyptian plain.\nThe melancholy slackening that ensued\nUpon those tidings by the peasant given\nWas soon dislodged. Downwards we hurried fast,\nAnd, with the half-shaped road which we had missed,\nEntered a narrow chasm. The brook and road\nWere fellow-travellers in this gloomy strait,\nAnd with them did we journey several hours\nAt a slow pace. The immeasurable height\nOf woods decaying, never to be decayed,\nThe stationary blasts of waterfalls,\nAnd in the narrow rent at every turn\nWinds thwarting winds, bewildered and forlorn,\nThe torrents shooting from the clear blue sky,\nThe rocks that muttered close upon our ears,\nBlack drizzling crags that spake by the way-side\nAs if a voice were in them, the sick sight\nAnd giddy prospect of the raving stream,\nThe unfettered clouds and region of the Heavens,\nTumult and peace, the darkness and the light-\none mind, the features\nOf the same face, blossoms upon one tree;\n\nCharacters of the great Apocalypse,\nThe types and symbols of Eternity,\nOf first, and last, and midst, and without end.\n.\n.\n.\nBut here I must break off, and bid farewell\nTo days, each offering some new sight, or fraught\nWith some untried adventure, in a course\nProlonged till sprinklings of autumnal snow\nChecked our unwearied steps. Let this alone\nBe mentioned as a parting word, that not\nIn hollow exultation, dealing out\nHyperboles of praise comparative,\nNot rich one moment to be poor for ever;\nNot prostrate, overborne, as if the mind\nHerself were nothing, a mere pensioner\nOn outward forms--did we in presence stand\nOf that magnificent region. On the front\nOf this whole Song is written that my heart\nMust, in such Temple, needs have offered up\nA different worship. Finally, whate'er\nI saw, or heard, or felt, was but a stream\nThat flowed into a kindred stream; a gale,\nConfederate with the current of the soul,\nTo speed my voyage; every sound or sight,\nIn its degree of power, administered\nTo grandeur or to tenderness,--to the one\nDirectly, but to tender thoughts by means\nLess often instantaneous in effect; 750\nLed me to these by paths that, in the main,\nWere more circuitous, but not less sure\nDuly to reach the point marked out by Heaven.\nOh, most beloved Friend! a glorious time,\nA happy time that was; triumphant looks\nWere then the common language of all eyes;\nAs if awaked from sleep, the Nations hailed\nTheir great expectancy: the fife of war\nWas then a spirit-stirring sound indeed,\nA blackbird's whistle in a budding grove.\nWe left the Swiss exulting in the fate\nOf their near neighbours; and, when shortening fast\nOur pilgrimage, nor distant far from home,\nWe crossed the Brabant armies on the fret\nFor battle in the cause of Liberty.\nA stripling, scarcely of the household then\nOf social life, I looked upon these things\nAs from a distance; heard, and saw, and felt,\nWas touched, but with no intimate concern;\nI seemed to move along them, as a bird 770\nMoves through the air, or as a fish pursues\nIts sport, or feeds in its proper element;\n\nI wanted not that joy, I did not need\nSuch help; the ever-living universe,\nTurn where I might, was opening out its glories,\nAnd the independent spirit of pure youth\nCalled forth, at every season, new delights,\nSpread round my steps like sunshine o'er green fields.\nBOOK NINTH\nRESIDENCE IN FRANCE\nAmong that band of Officers was one,\nAlready hinted at, of other mould-\nnce rejected by the rest,\nAnd with an oriental loathing spurned, 290\nAs of a different caste. A meeker man\nThan this lived never, nor a more benign,\nMeek though enthusiastic. Injuries\nMade 'him' more gracious, and his nature then\nDid breathe its sweetness out most sensibly,\nAs aromatic flowers on Alpine turf,\nWhen foot hath crushed them. He through the events\nOf that great change wandered in perfect faith,\nAs through a book, an old romance, or tale\nOf Fairy, or some dream of actions wrought\nBehind the summer clouds. By birth he ranked\nWith the most noble, but unto the poor\nAmong mankind he was in service bound,\nAs by some tie invisible, oaths professed\nTo a religious order. Man he loved\nAs man; and, to the mean and the obscure,\nAnd all the homely in their homely works,\nTransferred a courtesy which had no air\nOf condescension; but did rather seem\nA passion and a gallantry, like that 310\nWhich he, a soldier, in his idler day\nHad paid to woman: somewhat vain he was,\nOr seemed so, yet it was not vanity,\nBut fondness, and a kind of radiant joy\nDiffused around him, while he was intent\nOn works of love or freedom, or revolved\nComplacently the progress of a cause,\nWhereof he was a part: yet this was meek\nAnd placid, and took nothing from the man\nThat was delightful. Oft in solitude 320\nWith him did I discourse about the end\nOf civil government, and its wisest forms;\nOf ancient loyalty, and chartered rights,\nCustom and habit, novelty and change;\nOf self-respect, and virtue in the few\n\nFor patrimonial honour set apart,\nAnd ignorance in the labouring multitude.\nFor he, to all intolerance indisposed,\nBalanced these contemplations in his mind;\nAnd I, who at that time was scarcely dipped\nInto the turmoil, bore a sounder judgment\nThan later days allowed; carried about me,\nWith less alloy to its integrity,\nThe experience of past ages, as, through help\nOf books and common life, it makes sure way\nTo youthful minds, by objects over near\nNot pressed upon, nor dazzled or misled\nBy struggling with the crowd for present ends.\nBut though not deaf, nor obstinate to find\nError without excuse upon the side\nOf them who strove against us, more delight\nWe took, and let this freely be confessed,\nIn painting to ourselves the miseries\nOf royal courts, and that voluptuous life\nUnfeeling, where the man who is of soul\nThe meanest thrives the most; where dignity,\nTrue personal dignity, abideth not;\nA light, a cruel, and vain world cut off\nFrom the natural inlets of just sentiment,\nFrom lowly sympathy and chastening truth;\nWhere good and evil interchange their names,\nAnd thirst for bloody spoils abroad is paired\nWith vice at home. We added dearest themes-\nnoble nature, as it is\nThe gift which God has placed within his power,\nHis blind desires and steady faculties\nCapable of clear truth, the one to break\nBondage, the other to build liberty\nOn firm foundations, making social life,\nThrough knowledge spreading and imperishable, 360\nAs just in regulation, and as pure\nAs individual in the wise and good.\nWe summoned up the honourable deeds\nOf ancient Story, thought of each bright spot,\nThat would be found in all recorded time,\nOf truth preserved and error passed away;\nOf single spirits that catch the flame from Heaven,\nAnd how the multitudes of men will feed\nAnd fan each other; thought of sects, how keen\nThey are to put the appropriate nature on,\nTriumphant over every obstacle\nOf custom, language, country, love, or hate,\nAnd what they do and suffer for their creed;\nHow far they travel, and how long endure;\n\nHow quickly mighty Nations have been formed,\nFrom least beginnings; how, together locked\nBy new opinions, scattered tribes have made\nOne body, spreading wide as clouds in heaven.\nTo aspirations then of our own minds\nDid we appeal; and, finally, beheld 380\nA living confirmation of the whole\nBefore us, in a people from the depth\nOf shameful imbecility uprisen,\nFresh as the morning star. Elate we looked\nUpon their virtues; saw, in rudest men,\nSelf-sacrifice the firmest; generous love,\nAnd continence of mind, and sense of right,\nUppermost in the midst of fiercest strife.\nOh, sweet it is, in academic groves,\nOr such retirement, Friend! as we have known\nIn the green dales beside our Rotha's stream,\nGreta, or Derwent, or some nameless rill,\nTo ruminate, with interchange of talk,\nOn rational liberty, and hope in man,\nJustice and peace. But far more sweet such toil-\nr it leads to thoughts abstruse-\nbe standing on the brink\nOf some great trial, and we hear the voice\nOf one devoted,--one whom circumstance\nHath called upon to embody his deep sense\nIn action, give it outwardly a shape,\nAnd that of benediction, to the world.\nThen doubt is not, and truth is more than truth,--\nA hope it is, and a desire; a creed\nOf zeal, by an authority Divine\nSanctioned, of danger, difficulty, or death.\nSuch conversation, under Attic shades,\nDid Dion hold with Plato; ripened thus\nFor a Deliverer's glorious task,--and such\nHe, on that ministry already bound, 410\nHeld with Eudemus and Timonides,\nSurrounded by adventurers in arms,\nWhen those two vessels with their daring freight,\nFor the Sicilian Tyrant's overthrow,\nSailed from Zacynthus,--philosophic war,\nLed by Philosophers. With harder fate,\nThough like ambition, such was he, O Friend!\nOf whom I speak. So Beaupuis (let the name\nStand near the worthiest of Antiquity)\nFashioned his life; and many a long discourse, 420\nWith like persuasion honoured, we maintained:\nHe, on his part, accoutred for the worst,\nHe perished fighting, in supreme command,\nUpon the borders of the unhappy Loire,\n\nFor liberty, against deluded men,\nHis fellow-countrymen; and yet most blessed\nIn this, that he the fate of later times\nLived not to see, nor what we now behold,\nWho have as ardent hearts as he had then.\nAlong that very Loire, with festal mirth\nResounding at all hours, and innocent yet\nOf civil slaughter, was our frequent walk;\nOr in wide forests of continuous shade,\nLofty and over-arched, with open space\nBeneath the trees, clear footing many a mile-\nn region. Oft amid those haunts,\nFrom earnest dialogues I slipped in thought,\nAnd let remembrance steal to other times,\nWhen, o'er those interwoven roots, moss-clad,\nAnd smooth as marble or a waveless sea,440\nSome Hermit, from his cell forth-strayed, might pace\nIn sylvan meditation undisturbed;\nAs on the pavement of a Gothic church\nWalks a lone Monk, when service hath expired,\nIn peace and silence. But if e'er was heard,--\nHeard, though unseen,--a devious traveller,\nRetiring or approaching from afar\nWith speed and echoes loud of trampling hoofs\nFrom the hard floor reverberated, then\nIt was Angelica thundering through the woods\nUpon her palfrey, or that gentle maid\nErminia, fugitive as fair as she.\nSometimes methought I saw a pair of knights\nJoust underneath the trees, that as in storm\nRocked high above their heads; anon, the din\nOf boisterous merriment, and music's roar,\nIn sudden proclamation, burst from haunt\nOf Satyrs in some viewless glade, with dance\nRejoicing o'er a female in the midst,\nA mortal beauty, their unhappy thrall. 460\nThe width of those huge forests, unto me\nA novel scene, did often in this way\nMaster my fancy while I wandered on\nWith that revered companion. And sometimes-\neadow green,\nBy a brook-side, we came, a roofless pile,\nAnd not by reverential touch of Time\nDismantled, but by violence abrupt-\nng colloquies,\nIn spite of real fervour, and of that 470\nLess genuine and wrought up within myself-\not but bewail a wrong so harsh,\nAnd for the Matin-bell to sound no more\nGrieved, and the twilight taper, and the cross\n\nHigh on the topmost pinnacle, a sign\n(How welcome to the weary traveller's eyes!)\nOf hospitality and peaceful rest.\nAnd when the partner of those varied walks\nPointed upon occasion to the site\nOf Romorentin, home of ancient kings, 480\nTo the imperial edifice of Blois,\nOr to that rural castle, name now slipped\nFrom my remembrance, where a lady lodged,\nBy the first Francis wooed, and bound to him\nIn chains of mutual passion, from the tower,\nAs a tradition of the country tells,\nPractised to commune with her royal knight\nBy cressets and love-beacons, intercourse\n'Twixt her high-seated residence and his\nFar off at Chambord on the plain beneath;\nEven here, though less than with the peaceful house\nReligious, 'mid those frequent monuments\nOf Kings, their vices and their better deeds,\nImagination, potent to inflame\nAt times with virtuous wrath and noble scorn,\nDid also often mitigate the force\nOf civic prejudice, the bigotry,\nSo call it, of a youthful patriot's mind;\nAnd on these spots with many gleams I looked\nOf chivalrous delight. Yet not the less,\nHatred of absolute rule, where will of one\nIs law for all, and of that barren pride\nIn them who, by immunities unjust,\nBetween the sovereign and the people stand,\nHis helper and not theirs, laid stronger hold\nDaily upon me, mixed with pity too\nAnd love; for where hope is, there love will be\nFor the abject multitude, And when we chanced\nOne day to meet a hunger-bitten girl,\nWho crept along fitting her languid gait\nUnto a heifer's motion, by a cord\nTied to her arm, and picking thus from the lane\nIts sustenance, while the girl with pallid hands\nWas busy knitting in a heartless mood\nOf solitude, and at the sight my friend\nIn agitation said, \"'Tis against 'that'\nThat we are fighting,\" I with him believed\nThat a benignant spirit was abroad\nWhich might not be withstood, that poverty\nAbject as this would in a little time 520\nBe found no more, that we should see the earth\nUnthwarted in her wish to recompense\nThe meek, the lowly, patient child of toil,\nAll institutes for ever blotted out\nThat legalised exclusion, empty pomp\n\nAbolished, sensual state and cruel power\nWhether by edict of the one or few;\nAnd finally, as sum and crown of all,\nShould see the people having a strong hand\nIn framing their own laws; whence better days 530\nTo all mankind. But, these things set apart,\nWas not this single confidence enough\nTo animate the mind that ever turned\nA thought to human welfare? That henceforth\nCaptivity by mandate without law\nShould cease; and open accusation lead\nTo sentence in the hearing of the world,\nAnd open punishment, if not the air\nBe free to breathe in, and the heart of man\nDread nothing?\nBOOK TENTH\nRESIDENCE IN FRANCE (continued)\nIn this frame of mind,\nDragged by a chain of harsh necessity,\nSo seemed it,--now I thankfully acknowledge,\nForced by the gracious providence of Heaven,--\nTo England I returned, else (though assured\nThat I both was and must be of small weight,\nNo better than a landsman on the deck\nOf a ship struggling with a hideous storm)\nDoubtless, I should have then made common cause\nWith some who perished; haply perished too,\nA poor mistaken and bewildered offering,--\nShould to the breast of Nature have gone back,\nWith all my resolutions, all my hopes,\nA Poet only to myself, to men\nUseless, and even, beloved Friend! a soul\nTo thee unknown!\nTwice had the trees let fall\nTheir leaves, as often Winter had put on\nHis hoary crown, since I had seen the surge\nBeat against Albion's shore, since ear of mine\nHad caught the accents of my native speech\nUpon our native country's sacred ground.\nA patriot of the world, how could I glide\nInto communion with her sylvan shades,\nErewhile my tuneful haunt? It pleased me more\nTo abide in the great City, where I found\nThe general air still busy with the stir\nOf that first memorable onset made\nBy a strong levy of humanity\nUpon the traffickers in Negro blood;\n\nEffort which, though defeated, had recalled\nTo notice old forgotten principles,\nAnd through the nation spread a novel heat\nOf virtuous feeling. For myself, I own\nThat this particular strife had wanted power\nTo rivet my affections; nor did now\nIts unsuccessful issue much excite\nMy sorrow; for I brought with me the faith\nThat, if France prospered, good men would not long\nPay fruitless worship to humanity,\nAnd this most rotten branch of human shame,\nObject, so seemed it, of superfluous pains\nWould fall together with its parent tree.\nWhat, then, were my emotions, when in arms\nBritain put forth her free-born strength in league,\nOh, pity and shame! with those confederate Powers!\nNot in my single self alone I found,\nBut in the minds of all ingenuous youth,\nChange and subversion from that hour. No shock\nGiven to my moral nature had I known\nDown to that very moment; neither lapse270\nNor turn of sentiment that might be named\nA revolution, save at this one time;\nAll else was progress on the self-same path\nOn which, with a diversity of pace,\nI had been travelling: this a stride at once\nInto another region. As a light\nAnd pliant harebell, swinging in the breeze\nOn some grey rock--its birth-place--so had I\nWantoned, fast rooted on the ancient tower\nOf my beloved country, wishing not\nA happier fortune than to wither there:\nNow was I from that pleasant station torn\nAnd tossed about in whirlwind. I rejoiced,\nYea, afterwards--truth most painful to record!--\nExulted, in the triumph of my soul,\nWhen Englishmen by thousands were o'erthrown,\nLeft without glory on the field, or driven,\nBrave hearts! to shameful flight. It was a grief,--\nGrief call it not, 'twas anything but that,--\nA conflict of sensations without name, 290\nOf which 'he' only, who may love the sight\nOf a village steeple, as I do, can judge,\nWhen, in the congregation bending all\nTo their great Father, prayers were offered up,\nOr praises for our country's victories;\nAnd, 'mid the simple worshippers, perchance\nI only, like an uninvited guest\nWhom no one owned, sate silent, shall I add,\nFed on the day of vengeance yet to come.\n\nOh! much have they to account for, who could tear,\nBy violence, at one decisive rent,\nFrom the best youth in England their dear pride,\nTheir joy, in England; this, too, at a time\nIn which worst losses easily might wean\nThe best of names, when patriotic love\nDid of itself in modesty give way,\nLike the Precursor when the Deity\nIs come Whose harbinger he was; a time\nIn which apostasy from ancient faith\nSeemed but conversion to a higher creed;\nWithal a season dangerous and wild,\nA time when sage Experience would have snatched\nFlowers out of any hedge-row to compose\nA chaplet in contempt of his grey locks.\nWhen the proud fleet that bears the red-cross flag\nIn that unworthy service was prepared\nTo mingle, I beheld the vessels lie,\nA brood of gallant creatures, on the deep;\nI saw them in their rest, a sojourner\nThrough a whole month of calm and glassy days 320\nIn that delightful island which protects\nTheir place of convocation--there I heard,\nEach evening, pacing by the still sea-shore,\nA monitory sound that never failed,--\nThe sunset cannon. While the orb went down\nIn the tranquillity of nature, came\nThat voice, ill requiem! seldom heard by me\nWithout a spirit overcast by dark\nImaginations, sense of woes to come,\nSorrow for human kind, and pain of heart.\nIn France, the men, who, for their desperate ends,\nHad plucked up mercy by the roots, were glad\nOf this new enemy. Tyrants, strong before\nIn wicked pleas, were strong as demons now;\nAnd thus, on every side beset with foes,\nThe goaded land waxed mad; the crimes of few\nSpread into madness of the many; blasts\nFrom hell came sanctified like airs from heaven.\nThe sternness of the just, the faith of those\nWho doubted not that Providence had times\nOf vengeful retribution, theirs who throned\nThe human Understanding paramount\nAnd made of that their God, the hopes of men\nWho were content to barter short-lived pangs\nFor a paradise of ages, the blind rage\nOf insolent tempers, the light vanity\nOf intermeddlers, steady purposes\nOf the suspicious, slips of the indiscreet,\n\nAnd all the accidents of life--were pressed\nInto one service, busy with one work. 350\nThe Senate stood aghast, her prudence quenched,\nHer wisdom stifled, and her justice scared,\nHer frenzy only active to extol\nPast outrages, and shape the way for new,\nWhich no one dared to oppose or mitigate.\nDomestic carnage now filled the whole year\nWith feast-days; old men from the chimney-nook,\nThe maiden from the bosom of her love,\nThe mother from the cradle of her babe,\nThe warrior from the field--all perished, all-- 360\nFriends, enemies, of all parties, ages, ranks,\nHead after head, and never heads enough\nFor those that bade them fall. They found their joy,\nThey made it proudly, eager as a child,\n(If like desires of innocent little ones\nMay with such heinous appetites be compared),\nPleased in some open field to exercise\nA toy that mimics with revolving wings\nThe motion of a wind-mill; though the air\nDo of itself blow fresh, and make the vanes\nSpin in his eyesight, 'that' contents him not,\nBut with the plaything at arm's length, he sets\nHis front against the blast, and runs amain,\nThat it may whirl the faster.\nAmid the depth\nOf those enormities, even thinking minds\nForgot, at seasons, whence they had their being\nForgot that such a sound was ever heard\nAs Liberty upon earth: yet all beneath\nHer innocent authority was wrought,\nNor could have been, without her blessed name. 380\nThe illustrious wife of Roland, in the hour\nOf her composure, felt that agony,\nAnd gave it vent in her last words. O Friend!\nIt was a lamentable time for man,\nWhether a hope had e'er been his or not:\nA woful time for them whose hopes survived\nThe shock; most woful for those few who still\nWere flattered, and had trust in human kind:\nThey had the deepest feeling of the grief.\nMeanwhile the Invaders fared as they deserved: 390\nThe Herculean Commonwealth had put forth her arms,\nAnd throttled with an infant godhead's might\nThe snakes about her cradle; that was well,\nAnd as it should be; yet no cure for them\nWhose souls were sick with pain of what would be\nHereafter brought in charge against mankind.\nMost melancholy at that time, O Friend!\n\nWere my day-thoughts,--my nights were miserable;\nThrough months, through years, long after the last beat\nOf those atrocities, the hour of sleep 400\nTo me came rarely charged with natural gifts,\nSuch ghastly visions had I of despair\nAnd tyranny, and implements of death;\nAnd innocent victims sinking under fear,\nAnd momentary hope, and worn-out prayer,\nEach in his separate cell, or penned in crowds\nFor sacrifice, and struggling with fond mirth\nAnd levity in dungeons, where the dust\nWas laid with tears. Then suddenly the scene\nChanged, and the unbroken dream entangled me\nIn long orations, which I strove to plead\nBefore unjust tribunals,--with a voice\nLabouring, a brain confounded, and a sense,\nDeath-like, of treacherous desertion, felt\nIn the last place of refuge--my own soul.\nWhen I began in youth's delightful prime\nTo yield myself to Nature, when that strong\nAnd holy passion overcame me first,\nNor day nor night, evening or morn, was free\nFrom its oppression. But, O Power Supreme!\nWithout Whose call this world would cease to breathe\nWho from the fountain of Thy grace dost fill\nThe veins that branch through every frame of life,\nMaking man what he is, creature divine,\nIn single or in social eminence,\nAbove the rest raised infinite ascents\nWhen reason that enables him to be\nIs not sequestered--what a change is here!\nHow different ritual for this after-worship,\nWhat countenance to promote this second love! 430\nThe first was service paid to things which lie\nGuarded within the bosom of Thy will.\nTherefore to serve was high beatitude;\nTumult was therefore gladness, and the fear\nEnnobling, venerable; sleep secure,\nAnd waking thoughts more rich than happiest dreams.\nBut as the ancient Prophets, borne aloft\nIn vision, yet constrained by natural laws\nWith them to take a troubled human heart,\nWanted not consolations, nor a creed 440\nOf reconcilement, then when they denounced,\nOn towns and cities, wallowing in the abyss\nOf their offences, punishment to come;\nOr saw, like other men, with bodily eyes,\nBefore them, in some desolated place,\nThe wrath consummate and the threat fulfilled;\n\nSo, with devout humility be it said,\nSo, did a portion of that spirit fall\nOn me uplifted from the vantage-ground\nOf pity and sorrow to a state of being 450\nThat through the time's exceeding fierceness saw\nGlimpses of retribution, terrible,\nAnd in the order of sublime behests:\nBut, even if that were not, amid the awe\nOf unintelligible chastisement,\nNot only acquiescences of faith\nSurvived, but daring sympathies with power,\nMotions not treacherous or profane, else why\nWithin the folds of no ungentle breast\nTheir dread vibration to this hour prolonged? 460\nWild blasts of music thus could find their way\nInto the midst of turbulent events;\nSo that worst tempests might be listened to.\nThen was the truth received into my heart,\nThat, under heaviest sorrow earth can bring,\nIf from the affliction somewhere do not grow\nHonour which could not else have been, a faith,\nAn elevation, and a sanctity,\nIf new strength be not given nor old restored,\nThe blame is ours, not Nature's. When a taunt 470\nWas taken up by scoffers in their pride,\nSaying, \"Behold the harvest that we reap\nFrom popular government and equality,\"\nI clearly saw that neither these nor aught\nOf wild belief engrafted on their names\nBy false philosophy had caused the woe,\nBut a terrific reservoir of guilt\nAnd ignorance filled up from age to age,\nThat could no longer hold its loathsome charge,\nBut burst and spread in deluge through the land.\nBOOK ELEVENTH\nFRANCE (concluded)\nIt hath been told\nThat I was led to take an eager part\nIn arguments of civil polity,\nAbruptly, and indeed before my time:\nI had approached, like other youths, the shield\nOf human nature from the golden side, 80\nAnd would have fought, even to the death, to attest\nThe quality of the metal which I saw.\nWhat there is best in individual man,\nOf wise in passion, and sublime in power,\nBenevolent in small societies,\n\nAnd great in large ones, I had oft revolved,\nFelt deeply, but not thoroughly understood\nBy reason: nay, far from it; they were yet,\nAs cause was given me afterwards to learn,\nNot proof against the injuries of the day;\nLodged only at the sanctuary's door,\nNot safe within its bosom. Thus prepared,\nAnd with such general insight into evil,\nAnd of the bounds which sever it from good,\nAs books and common intercourse with life\nMust needs have given--to the inexperienced mind,\nWhen the world travels in a beaten road,\nGuide faithful as is needed--I began\nTo meditate with ardour on the rule\nAnd management of nations; what it is 100\nAnd ought to be; and strove to learn how far\nTheir power or weakness, wealth or poverty,\nTheir happiness or misery, depends\nUpon their laws, and fashion of the State.\nO pleasant exercise of hope and joy!\nFor mighty were the auxiliars which then stood\nUpon our side, us who were strong in love!\nBliss was it in that dawn to be alive,\nBut to be young was very Heaven! O times,\nIn which the meagre, stale, forbidding ways\nOf custom, law, and statute, took at once\nThe attraction of a country in romance!\nWhen Reason seemed the most to assert her rights\nWhen most intent on making of herself\nA prime enchantress--to assist the work,\nWhich then was going forward in her name!\nNot favoured spots alone, but the whole Earth,\nThe beauty wore of promise--that which sets\n(As at some moments might not be unfelt\nAmong the bowers of Paradise itself) 120\nThe budding rose above the rose full blown.\nWhat temper at the prospect did not wake\nTo happiness unthought of? The inert\nWere roused, and lively natures rapt away!\nThey who had fed their childhood upon dreams,\nThe play-fellows of fancy, who had made\nAll powers of swiftness, subtilty, and strength\nTheir ministers,--who in lordly wise had stirred\nAmong the grandest objects of the sense,\nAnd dealt with whatsoever they found there\nAs if they had within some lurking right\nTo wield it;--they, too, who of gentle mood\nHad watched all gentle motions, and to these\nHad fitted their own thoughts, schemers more mild,\nAnd in the region of their peaceful selves;--\n\nNow was it that 'both' found, the meek and lofty\nDid both find, helpers to their hearts' desire,\nAnd stuff at hand, plastic as they could wish,--\nWere called upon to exercise their skill,\nNot in Utopia,--subterranean fields,-- 140\nOr some secreted island, Heaven knows where!\nBut in the very world, which is the world\nOf all of us,--the place where, in the end,\nWe find our happiness, or not at all!\nWhy should I not confess that Earth was then\nTo me, what an inheritance, new-fallen,\nSeems, when the first time visited, to one\nWho thither comes to find in it his home?\nHe walks about and looks upon the spot\nWith cordial transport, moulds it and remoulds, 150\nAnd is half-pleased with things that are amiss,\n'Twill be such joy to see them disappear.\nAn active partisan, I thus convoked\nFrom every object pleasant circumstance\nTo suit my ends; I moved among mankind\nWith genial feelings still predominant;\nWhen erring, erring on the better part,\nAnd in the kinder spirit; placable,\nIndulgent, as not uninformed that men\nSee as they have been taught--Antiquity160\nGives rights to error; and aware, no less\nThat throwing off oppression must be work\nAs well of License as of Liberty;\nAnd above all--for this was more than all-\nnow and then\nBlow keen upon an eminence that gave\nProspect so large into futurity;\nIn brief, a child of Nature, as at first,\nDiffusing only those affections wider\nThat from the cradle had grown up with me,\nAnd losing, in no other way than light\nIs lost in light, the weak in the more strong.\nIn the main outline, such it might be said\nWas my condition, till with open war\nBritain opposed the liberties of France.\nThis threw me first out of the pale of love;\nSoured and corrupted, upwards to the source,\nMy sentiments; was not, as hitherto,\nA swallowing up of lesser things in great,\nBut change of them into their contraries;\nAnd thus a way was opened for mistakes\nAnd false conclusions, in degree as gross,\nIn kind more dangerous. What had been a pride,\n\nWas now a shame; my likings and my loves\nRan in new channels, leaving old ones dry;\nAnd hence a blow that, in maturer age,\nWould but have touched the judgment, struck more deep\nInto sensations near the heart: meantime,\nAs from the first, wild theories were afloat,\nTo whose pretensions, sedulously urged,190\nI had but lent a careless ear, assured\nThat time was ready to set all things right,\nAnd that the multitude, so long oppressed,\nWould be oppressed no more.\nBut when events\nBrought less encouragement, and unto these\nThe immediate proof of principles no more\nCould be entrusted, while the events themselves,\nWorn out in greatness, stripped of novelty,\nLess occupied the mind, and sentiments\nCould through my understanding's natural growth 200\nNo longer keep their ground, by faith maintained\nOf inward consciousness, and hope that laid\nHer hand upon her object--evidence\nSafer, of universal application, such\nAs could not be impeached, was sought elsewhere.\n.\n.\n.\nThis was the time, when, all things tending fast\nTo depravation, speculative schemes-\nThat promised to abstract the hopes of Man\nOut of his feelings, to be fixed thenceforth\nFor ever in a purer element-\nFound ready welcome. Tempting region 'that'\nFor Zeal to enter and refresh herself,\nWhere passions had the privilege to work,\nAnd never hear the sound of their own names.\nBut, speaking more in charity, the dream\nFlattered the young, pleased with extremes, nor least\nWith that which makes our Reason's naked self\nThe object of its fervour. What delight!\nHow glorious! in self-knowledge and self-rule,\nTo look through all the frailties of the world,\nAnd, with a resolute mastery shaking off\nInfirmities of nature, time, and place,\nBuild social upon personal Liberty, 240\nWhich, to the blind restraints of general laws,\nSuperior, magisterially adopts\nOne guide, the light of circumstances, flashed\nUpon an independent intellect.\nThus expectation rose again; thus hope,\nFrom her first ground expelled, grew proud once more.\nOft, as my thoughts were turned to human kind,\nI scorned indifference; but, inflamed with thirst\nOf a secure intelligence, and sick\n\nOf other longing, I pursued what seemed250\nA more exalted nature; wished that Man\nShould start out of his earthy, worm-like state,\nAnd spread abroad the wings of Liberty,\nLord of himself, in undisturbed delight--\nA noble aspiration! 'yet' I feel\n(Sustained by worthier as by wiser thoughts)\nThe aspiration, nor shall ever cease\nTo feel it;--but return we to our course.\nEnough, 'tis true--could such a plea excuse\nThose aberrations--had the clamorous friends\nOf ancient Institutions said and done\nTo bring disgrace upon their very names;\nDisgrace, of which, custom and written law,\nAnd sundry moral sentiments as props\nOr emanations of those institutes,\nToo justly bore a part. A veil had been\nUplifted; why deceive ourselves? in sooth,\n'Twas even so; and sorrow for the man\nWho either had not eyes wherewith to see,\nOr, seeing, had forgotten! A strong shock\nWas given to old opinions; all men's minds\nHad felt its power, and mine was both let loose,\nLet loose and goaded. After what hath been\nAlready said of patriotic love,\nSuffice it here to add, that, somewhat stern\nIn temperament, withal a happy man,\nAnd therefore bold to look on painful things,\nFree likewise of the world, and thence more bold,\nI summoned my best skill, and toiled, intent\nTo anatomise the frame of social life; 280\nYea, the whole body of society\nSearched to its heart. Share with me, Friend! the wish\nThat some dramatic tale, endued with shapes\nLivelier, and flinging out less guarded words\nThan suit the work we fashion, might set forth\nWhat then I learned, or think I learned, of truth,\nAnd the errors into which I fell, betrayed\nBy present objects, and by reasonings false\nFrom their beginnings, inasmuch as drawn\nOut of a heart that had been turned aside\nFrom Nature's way by outward accidents,\nAnd which was thus confounded, more and more\nMisguided, and misguiding. So I fared,\nDragging all precepts, judgments, maxims, creeds,\nLike culprits to the bar; calling the mind,\nSuspiciously, to establish in plain day\nHer titles and her honours; now believing,\nNow disbelieving; endlessly perplexed\nWith impulse, motive, right and wrong, the ground\n\nOf obligation, what the rule and whence300\nThe sanction; till, demanding formal 'proof',\nAnd seeking it in every thing, I lost\nAll feeling of conviction, and, in fine,\nSick, wearied out with contrarieties,\nYielded up moral questions in despair.\nBOOK TWELFTH\nIMAGINATION AND TASTE, HOW IMPAIRED AND RESTORED\nLONG time have human ignorance and guilt\nDetained us, on what spectacles of woe\nCompelled to look, and inwardly oppressed\nWith sorrow, disappointment, vexing thoughts,\nConfusion of the judgment, zeal decayed,\nAnd, lastly, utter loss of hope itself\nAnd things to hope for! Not with these began\nOur song, and not with these our song must end.\nYe motions of delight, that haunt the sides\nOf the green hills; ye breezes and soft airs,\nWhose subtle intercourse with breathing flowers,\nFeelingly watched, might teach Man's haughty race\nHow without Injury to take, to give\nWithout offence; ye who, as if to show\nThe wondrous influence of power gently used,\nBend the complying heads of lordly pines,\nAnd, with a touch, shift the stupendous clouds\nThrough the whole compass of the sky; ye brooks,\nMuttering along the stones, a busy noise\nBy day, a quiet sound in silent night; 20\nYe waves, that out of the great deep steal forth\nIn a calm hour to kiss the pebbly shore,\nNot mute, and then retire, fearing no storm;\nAnd you, ye groves, whose ministry it is\nTo interpose the covert of your shades,\nEven as a sleep, between the heart of man\nAnd outward troubles, between man himself,\nNot seldom, and his own uneasy heart:\nOh! that I had a music and a voice\nHarmonious as your own, that I might tell\nWhat ye have done for me. The morning shines,\nNor heedeth Man's perverseness; Spring returns,--\nI saw the Spring return, and could rejoice,\nIn common with the children of her love,\nPiping on boughs, or sporting on fresh fields,\nOr boldly seeking pleasure nearer heaven\nOn wings that navigate cerulean skies.\nSo neither were complacency, nor peace,\nNor tender yearnings, wanting for my good\n\nThrough these distracted times; in Nature still 40\nGlorying, I found a counterpoise in her,\nWhich, when the spirit of evil reached its height,\nMaintained for me a secret happiness.\n.\n.\n.\nThere are in our existence spots of time,\nThat with distinct pre-eminence retain\nA renovating virtue, whence--depressed 210\nBy false opinion and contentious thought,\nOr aught of heavier or more deadly weight,\nIn trivial occupations, and the round\nOf ordinary intercourse--our minds\nAre nourished and invisibly repaired;\nA virtue, by which pleasure is enhanced,\nThat penetrates, enables us to mount,\nWhen high, more high, and lifts us up when fallen.\nThis efficacious spirit chiefly lurks\nAmong those passages of life that give 220\nProfoundest knowledge to what point, and how,\nThe mind is lord and master--outward sense\nThe obedient servant of her will. Such moments\nAre scattered everywhere, taking their date\nFrom our first childhood. I remember well,\nThat once, while yet my inexperienced hand\nCould scarcely hold a bridle, with proud hopes\nI mounted, and we journeyed towards the hills:\nAn ancient servant of my father's house\nWas with me, my encourager and guide: 230\nWe had not travelled long, ere some mischance\nDisjoined me from my comrade; and, through fear\nDismounting, down the rough and stony moor\nI led my horse, and, stumbling on, at length\nCame to a bottom, where in former times\nA murderer had been hung in iron chains.\nThe gibbet-mast had mouldered down, the bones\nAnd iron case were gone; but on the turf,\nHard by, soon after that fell deed was wrought,\nSome unknown hand had carved the murderer's name.240\nThe monumental letters were inscribed\nIn times long past; but still, from year to year\nBy superstition of the neighbourhood,\nThe grass is cleared away, and to this hour\nThe characters are fresh and visible:\nA casual glance had shown them, and I fled,\nFaltering and faint, and ignorant of the road:\nThen, reascending the bare common, saw\nA naked pool that lay beneath the hills,\nThe beacon on the summit, and, more near,\nA girl, who bore a pitcher on her head,\nAnd seemed with difficult steps to force her way\nAgainst the blowing wind. It was, in truth,\n\nAn ordinary sight; but I should need\nColours and words that are unknown to man,\nTo paint the visionary dreariness\nWhich, while I looked all round for my lost guide,\nInvested moorland waste and naked pool,\nThe beacon crowning the lone eminence,\nThe female and her garments vexed and tossed\nBy the strong wind. When, in the blessed hours\nOf early love, the loved one at my side,\nI roamed, in daily presence of this scene,\nUpon the naked pool and dreary crags,\nAnd on the melancholy beacon, fell\nA spirit of pleasure and youth's golden gleam;\nAnd think ye not with radiance more sublime\nFor these remembrances, and for the power\nThey had left behind? So feeling comes in aid\nOf feeling, and diversity of strength 270\nAttends us, if but once we have been strong.\nOh! mystery of man, from what a depth\nProceed thy honours. I am lost, but see\nIn simple childhood something of the base\nOn which thy greatness stands; but this I feel,\nThat from thyself it comes, that thou must give,\nElse never canst receive. The days gone by\nReturn upon me almost from the dawn\nOf life: the hiding-places of man's power\nOpen; I would approach them, but they close.\nI see by glimpses now; when age comes on,\nMay scarcely see at all; and I would give,\nWhile yet we may, as far as words can give,\nSubstance and life to what I feel, enshrining,\nSuch is my hope, the spirit of the Past\nFor future restoration.--Yet another\nOf these memorials:--\nOne Christmas-time,\nOn the glad eve of its dear holidays,\nFeverish, and tired, and restless, I went forth\nInto the fields, impatient for the sight\nOf those led palfreys that should bear us home;\nMy brothers and myself. There rose a crag,\nThat, from the meeting-point of two highways\nAscending, overlooked them both, far stretched;\nThither, uncertain on which road to fix\nMy expectation, thither I repaired,\nScout-like, and gained the summit; 'twas a day\nTempestuous, dark, and wild, and on the grass\nI sate half-sheltered by a naked wall;\nUpon my right hand couched a single sheep,\nUpon my left a blasted hawthorn stood;\nWith those companions at my side, I watched\nStraining my eyes intensely, as the mist\n\nGave intermitting prospect of the copse\nAnd plain beneath. Ere we to school returned,--\nThat dreary time,--ere we had been ten days\nSojourners in my father's house, he died;\nAnd I and my three brothers, orphans then,\nFollowed his body to the grave. The event,\nWith all the sorrow that it brought, appeared 310\nA chastisement; and when I called to mind\nThat day so lately past, when from the crag\nI looked in such anxiety of hope;\nWith trite reflections of morality,\nYet in the deepest passion, I bowed low\nTo God, Who thus corrected my desires;\nAnd, afterwards, the wind and sleety rain,\nAnd all the business of the elements,\nThe single sheep, and the one blasted tree,\nAnd the bleak music from that old stone wall, 320\nThe noise of wood and water, and the mist\nThat on the line of each of those two roads\nAdvanced in such indisputable shapes;\nAll these were kindred spectacles and sounds\nTo which I oft repaired, and thence would drink,\nAs at a fountain; and on winter nights,\nDown to this very time, when storm and rain\nBeat on my roof, or, haply, at noon-day,\nWhile in a grove I walk, whose lofty trees,\nLaden with summer's thickest foliage, rock\nIn a strong wind, some working of the spirit,\nSome inward agitations thence are brought,\nWhate'er their office, whether to beguile\nThoughts over busy in the course they took,\nOr animate an hour of vacant ease.\nBOOK FOURTEENTH\nCONCLUSION\nIN one of those excursions (may they ne'er\nFade from remembrance!) through the Northern tracts\nOf Cambria ranging with a youthful friend,\nI left Bethgelert's huts at couching-time,\nAnd westward took my way, to see the sun\nRise, from the top of Snowdon. To the door\nOf a rude cottage at the mountain's base\nWe came, and roused the shepherd who attends\nThe adventurous stranger's steps, a trusty guide;\nThen, cheered by short refreshment, sallied forth.10\nIt was a close, warm, breezeless summer night,\nWan, dull, and glaring, with a dripping fog\n\nLow-hung and thick that covered all the sky;\nBut, undiscouraged, we began to climb\nThe mountain-side. The mist soon girt us round,\nAnd, after ordinary travellers' talk\nWith our conductor, pensively we sank\nEach into commerce with his private thoughts:\nThus did we breast the ascent, and by myself\nWas nothing either seen or heard that checked\nThose musings or diverted, save that once\nThe shepherd's lurcher, who, among the crags,\nHad to his joy unearthed a hedgehog, teased\nHis coiled-up prey with barkings turbulent.\nThis small adventure, for even such it seemed\nIn that wild place and at the dead of night,\nBeing over and forgotten, on we wound\nIn silence as before. With forehead bent\nEarthward, as if in opposition set\nAgainst an enemy, I panted up 30\nWith eager pace, and no less eager thoughts.\nThus might we wear a midnight hour away,\nAscending at loose distance each from each,\nAnd I, as chanced, the foremost of the band;\nWhen at my feet the ground appeared to brighten,\nAnd with a step or two seemed brighter still;\nNor was time given to ask or learn the cause,\nFor instantly a light upon the turf\nFell like a flash, and lo! as I looked up,\nThe Moon hung naked in a firmament\nOf azure without cloud, and at my feet\nRested a silent sea of hoary mist.\nA hundred hills their dusky backs upheaved\nAll over this still ocean; and beyond,\nFar, far beyond, the solid vapours stretched,\nIn headlands, tongues, and promontory shapes,\nInto the main Atlantic, that appeared\nTo dwindle, and give up his majesty,\nUsurped upon far as the sight could reach.\nNot so the ethereal vault; encroachment none\nWas there, nor loss; only the inferior stars\nHad disappeared, or shed a fainter light\nIn the clear presence of the full-orbed Moon,\nWho, from her sovereign elevation, gazed\nUpon the billowy ocean, as it lay\nAll meek and silent, save that through a rift-\nthe shore whereon we stood,\nA fixed, abysmal, gloomy, breathing-place-\nhe roar of waters, torrents, streams\nInnumerable, roaring with one voice! 60\nHeard over earth and sea, and, in that hour,\nFor so it seemed, felt by the starry heavens.\n\nWhen into air had partially dissolved\nThat vision, given to spirits of the night\nAnd three chance human wanderers, in calm thought\nReflected, it appeared to me the type\nOf a majestic intellect, its acts\nAnd its possessions, what it has and craves,\nWhat in itself it is, and would become.\nThere I beheld the emblem of a mind\nThat feeds upon infinity, that broods\nOver the dark abyss, intent to hear\nIts voices issuing forth to silent light\nIn one continuous stream; a mind sustained\nBy recognitions of transcendent power,\nIn sense conducting to ideal form,\nIn soul of more than mortal privilege.\nOne function, above all, of such a mind\nHad Nature shadowed there, by putting forth,\n'Mid circumstances awful and sublime, 80\nThat mutual domination which she loves\nTo exert upon the face of outward things,\nSo moulded, joined, abstracted, so endowed\nWith interchangeable supremacy,\nThat men, least sensitive, see, hear, perceive,\nAnd cannot choose but feel. The power, which all\nAcknowledge when thus moved, which Nature thus\nTo bodily sense exhibits, is the express\nResemblance of that glorious faculty\nThat higher minds bear with them as their own. 90\nThis is the very spirit in which they deal\nWith the whole compass of the universe:\nThey from their native selves can send abroad\nKindred mutations; for themselves create\nA like existence; and, whene'er it dawns\nCreated for them, catch it, or are caught\nBy its inevitable mastery,\nLike angels stopped upon the wing by sound\nOf harmony from Heaven's remotest spheres.\nThem the enduring and the transient both\nServe to exalt; they build up greatest things\nFrom least suggestions; ever on the watch,\nWilling to work and to be wrought upon,\nThey need not extraordinary calls\nTo rouse them; in a world of life they live,\nBy sensible impressions not enthralled,\nBut by their quickening impulse made more prompt\nTo hold fit converse with the spiritual world,\nAnd with the generations of mankind\nSpread over time, past, present, and to come, 110\nAge after age, till Time shall be no more.\nSuch minds are truly from the Deity,\nFor they are Powers; and hence the highest bliss\n\nThat flesh can know is theirs--the consciousness\nOf Whom they are, habitually infused\nThrough every image and through every thought,\nAnd all affections by communion raised\nFrom earth to heaven, from human to divine;\nHence endless occupation for the Soul,\nWhether discursive or intuitive;\nHence cheerfulness for acts of daily life,\n\nEmotions which best foresight need not fear,\nMost worthy then of trust when most intense.\nHence, amid ills that vex and wrongs that crush\nOur hearts--if here the words of Holy Writ\nMay with fit reverence be applied--that peace\nWhich passeth understanding, that repose\nIn moral judgments which from this pure source\nMust come, or will by man be sought in vain."

Text: original translation in the public domain.\nFundamental Principles of the Metaphysic of Morals (1785)\nby Immanuel Kant\n(Adapted from the translation of T. K. Abbott by A.C. Kibel)\nfrom Section One\nNothing can possibly be conceived in the world, or even out of it, which can be called good, without\nqualification, except a good will. Intelligence, wit, judgement, and the other talents of the mind, however\nthey may be named, or courage, resolution, perseverance, as qualities of temperament, are undoubtedly\ngood and desirable in many respects; but these gifts of nature may also become extremely bad and\nmischievous if the will which is to make use of them, and which, therefore, constitutes what is called\ncharacter, is not good. It is the same with the gifts of fortune. Power, riches, honor, even health, and the\ngeneral well-being and contentment with one's condition which is called happiness, inspire pride, and\noften presumption, if there is not a good will to correct the influence of these on the mind, and with this\nalso to rectify the whole principle of acting and adapt it to its end. The sight of a being who is not\nadorned with a single feature of a pure and good will, enjoying unbroken prosperity, can never give\npleasure to an impartial rational spectator. Thus a good will appears to constitute the indispensable\ncondition even of being worthy of happiness.\nThere are even some qualities which are of service to this good will itself and may facilitate its\naction, yet which have no intrinsic unconditional value, but always presuppose a good will, and this\nqualifies the esteem that we justly have for them and does not permit us to regard them as absolutely\ngood. Moderation in the affections and passions, self-control, and calm deliberation are not only good in\nmany respects, but even seem to constitute part of the intrinsic worth of the person; but they are far from\ndeserving to be called good without qualification, although they have been so unconditionally praised by\nthe ancients. For without the principles of a good will, they may become extremely bad, and the coolness\nof a villain not only makes him far more dangerous, but also directly makes him more abominable in our\neyes than he would have been without it.\nA good will is good not because of what it performs or effects, not by its aptness for the\nattainment of some proposed end, but simply by virtue of the volition; that is, it is good in itself, and\nconsidered by itself is to be esteemed much higher than all that can be brought about by it in favor of any\ninclination, nay even of the sum total of all inclinations. Even if it should happen that, owing to special\ndisfavor of fortune, or the niggardly provision of a step-motherly nature, this will should wholly lack\npower to accomplish its purpose, if with its greatest efforts it should yet achieve nothing, and there should\nremain only the good will (not, to be sure, a mere wish, but the summoning of all means in our power),\nthen, like a jewel, it would still shine by its own light, as a thing which has its whole value in itself. Its\nusefulness or fruitfulness can neither add nor take away anything from this value. It would be, as it were,\nonly the setting to enable us to handle it the more conveniently in common commerce, or to attract to it\nthe attention of those who are not yet connoisseurs, but not to recommend it to true connoisseurs, or to\n\ndetermine its value.\nThere is, however, something so strange in this idea of the absolute value of the mere will, in\nwhich no account is taken of its utility, that notwithstanding the thorough assent of even common reason\nto the idea, yet a suspicion must arise that it may perhaps really be the product of mere high-flown fancy,\nand that we may have misunderstood the purpose of nature in assigning reason as the governor of our\nwill. Therefore we will examine this idea from this point of view.\nIn the physical constitution of an organized being, that is, a being adapted suitably to the purposes\nof life, we assume it as a fundamental principle that no organ for any purpose will be found but what is\nalso the fittest and best adapted for that purpose. Now in a being which has reason and a will, if the\nproper object of nature were its conservation, its welfare, in a word, its happiness, then nature would have\nhit upon a very bad arrangement in selecting the reason of the creature to carry out this purpose. For all\nthe actions which the creature has to perform with a view to this purpose, and the whole rule of its\nconduct, would be far more surely prescribed to it by instinct, and that end would have been attained\nthereby much more certainly than it ever can be by reason. Should reason have been communicated to\nthis favored creature over and above, it must only have served it to contemplate the happy constitution of\nits nature, to admire it, to congratulate itself thereon, and to feel thankful for it to the beneficent cause, but\nnot that it should subject its desires to that weak and delusive guidance and meddle bunglingly with the\npurpose of nature. In a word, nature would have taken care that reason should not break forth into\npractical exercise, nor have the presumption, with its weak insight, to think out for itself the plan of\nhappiness and of the means of attaining it. Nature would not only have taken on herself the choice of the\nends, but also of the means, and with wise foresight would have entrusted both to instinct.\nAnd, in fact, we find that the more a cultivated reason applies itself with deliberate purpose to the\nenjoyment of life and happiness, so much the more does the man fail of true satisfaction. And from this\ncircumstance there arises in many, if they are candid enough to confess it, a certain degree of misology,\nthat is, hatred of reason, especially in the case of those who are most experienced in the use of it, because\nafter calculating all the advantages they derive, I do not say from the invention of all the arts of common\nluxury, but even from the sciences (which seem to them to be after all only a luxury of the\nunderstanding), they find that they have, in fact, only brought more trouble on their shoulders. rather than\ngained in happiness; and they end by envying, rather than despising, the more common stamp of men\nwho keep closer to the guidance of mere instinct and do not allow their reason much influence on their\nconduct. And this we must admit, that the judgement of those who would very much lower the lofty\neulogies of the advantages which reason gives us in regard to the happiness and satisfaction of life, or\nwho would even reduce them below zero, is by no means morose or ungrateful to the goodness with\nwhich the world is governed, but that there lies at the root of these judgements the idea that our existence\nhas a different and far more worthy end, for which, and not for happiness, reason is properly intended,\nand which must, therefore, be regarded as the supreme condition to which the private ends of man must,\nfor the most part, be postponed.\nFor as reason is not competent to guide the will with certainty in regard to its objects and the\nsatisfaction of all our wants (which it to some extent even multiplies), this being an end to which an\nimplanted instinct would have led with much greater certainty; and since, nevertheless, reason is\nimparted to us as a practical faculty, i.e., as one which is to have influence on the will, therefore,\nadmitting that nature generally in the distribution of her capacities has adapted the means to the end, its\ntrue destination must be to produce a will, not merely good as a means to something else, but good in\nitself, for which reason was absolutely necessary. This will then, though not indeed the sole and complete\ngood, must be the supreme good and the condition of every other, even of the desire of happiness. Under\nthese circumstances, there is nothing inconsistent with the wisdom of nature in the fact that the cultivation\nof the reason, which is requisite for the first and unconditional purpose, does in many ways interfere, at\n\nleast in this life, with the attainment of the second, which is always conditional, namely, happiness. Nay,\nit may even reduce it to nothing, without nature thereby failing of her purpose. For reason recognizes the\nestablishment of a good will as its highest practical destination, and in attaining this purpose is capable\nonly of a satisfaction of its own proper kind, namely that from the attainment of an end, which end again\nis determined by reason only, notwithstanding that this may involve many a disappointment to the ends of\ninclination.\nWe have then to develop the notion of a will which deserves to be highly esteemed for itself and is good\nwithout a view to anything further, a notion which exists already in the sound natural understanding,\nrequiring rather to be cleared up than to be taught, and which in estimating the value of our actions always\ntakes the first place and constitutes the condition of all the rest. In order to do this, we will take the notion\nof duty, which includes that of a good will, although implying certain subjective restrictions and\nhindrances. These, however, far from concealing it, or rendering it unrecognizable, rather bring it out by\ncontrast and make it shine forth so much the brighter. . . .\nI omit here all actions which are already recognized as inconsistent with duty, although they may\nbe useful for this or that purpose, for with these the question whether they are done from duty cannot arise\nat all, since they even conflict with it. I also set aside those actions which really conform to duty, but to\nwhich men have no direct inclination, performing them because they are impelled thereto by some other\ninclination. For in this case we can readily distinguish whether the action which agrees with duty is done\nfrom duty, or from a selfish view. It is much harder to make this distinction when the action accords with\nduty and the subject has besides a direct inclination to it. For example, it is always a matter of duty that a\ntradesman should not over charge an inexperienced purchaser; and wherever there is much commerce the\nprudent tradesman does not overcharge, but keeps a fixed price for everyone, so that a child buys of him\nas well as any other. Men are thus honestly served; but this is not enough to make us believe that the\ntradesman has so acted from duty and from principles of honesty: his own advantage required it; it is out\nof the question in this case to suppose that he might besides have a direct inclination in favor of the\nbuyers, so that, as it were, from love he should give no advantage to one over another. Accordingly the\naction was done neither from duty nor from direct inclination, but merely with a selfish view.\nLikewise, where self-interest and inclination coincide: it is a duty to maintain one's life; and, in\naddition, everyone has also a direct inclination to do so. But on this account the of anxious care which\nmost men take for it has no intrinsic worth, and their maxim has no moral import. They preserve their life\nas duty requires, no doubt, but not because duty requires. On the other hand, if adversity and hopeless\nsorrow have completely taken away the relish for life; if the unfortunate one, strong in mind, indignant at\nhis fate rather than desponding or dejected, wishes for death, and yet preserves his life without loving it--\nnot from inclination or fear, but from duty-- then his maxim has a moral worth. . . .\nTo be beneficent when we can is a duty;\nand besides this, there are many minds so\nsympathetically constituted that, without any other motive of vanity or self-interest, they find a pleasure\nin spreading joy around them and can take delight in the satisfaction of others so far as it is their own\nwork. But I maintain that in such a case an action of this kind, however proper, however amiable it may\nbe, bas nevertheless no true moral worth, but is on a level with other inclinations, e.g., the inclination to\nhonor, which, if it is happily directed to that which is in fact of public utility and accordant with duty and\nconsequently honorable, deserves praise and encouragement, but not esteem. For the maxim lacks the\nmoral import of actions done from duty, not from inclination. Put the case that the mind of that\nphilanthropist were clouded by sorrow of his own, extinguishing all sympathy with the lot of others, and\nthat, while he still has the power to benefit others in distress, he is not touched by their trouble because he\nis absorbed with his own; and now suppose that he tears himself out of this dead insensibility, and\nperforms the action without any inclination to it, but simply from duty, only then has his action its\ngenuine moral worth. Further still; if nature has put little sympathy in the heart of this or that man; if he,\n\nsupposed to be an upright man, is by temperament cold and indifferent to the sufferings of others, perhaps\nbecause in respect of his own he is provided with special gifts of patience and fortitude and supposes, or\neven requires, that others should have the sameBand such a man would certainly not be the meanest\nproduct of natureBbut if nature had not specially framed him for a philanthropist, would he not still find\nin himself a source from which to give himself a far higher worth than that derived from good-natured\ntemperament? Unquestionably. It is just in this that the moral worth of the character is brought out which\nis incomparably the highest of all, namely, that he is beneficent, not from inclination, but from duty. . . .\nIt is in this manner, undoubtedly, that we are to understand those passages of Scripture also in\nwhich we are commanded to love our neighbor, even our enemy. For love, as an affection, cannot be\ncommanded, but beneficence for duty's sake may; even though we are not impelled to it by any\ninclination-- nay, are even repelled by a natural and unconquerable aversion. This is practical love and\nnot pathological-- a love which is seated in the will, and not in the propensities of feeling-- in principles\nof action and not of tender sympathy; and it is this love alone which can be commanded.\n[Thus the first proposition of morality is that to have moral worth an action must be done from\nduty.] The second proposition is: That an action done from duty derives its moral worth, not from the\npurpose which is to be attained by it, but from the maxim by which it is determined, and therefore does\nnot depend on the realization of the object of the action, but merely on the principle of volition by which\nthe action has taken place, without regard to any object of desire. It is clear from what precedes that the\npurposes that direct our actions, or their aims regarded as motives and incentives1 of the will, cannot give\nto actions any unconditional or moral worth. In what, then, can their worth lie, if it is not to consist in the\nwill and in reference to its expected effect? It cannot lie anywhere but in the principle of the will without\nregard to the ends which can be attained by the action. For the will stands between its a priori principle,\nwhich is formal, and its a posteriori motive2, which is material, as between two roads, and as it must be\ndetermined by something, it that it must be determined by the formal principle of volition when an action\nis done from duty, in which case every material principle has been withdrawn from it.\n1The word incentive throughout translates Triebfeder, a drive-stimulant or impulse-trigger.\nMotive translates Bewegungsgrund, the basis of an action. In ordinary usage, both of the German words\nand the words used to translate them can bear the same meaning. A good way to capture the opposition\nthat Kant means to draw is to call the first an Aimpulse@ and the second Athe aim of action@ .\n2a priori judgments follow simply from the use of concepts and are not derived from or justified\nby appeals to experience; a posteriori judgments are derived and justified empirically. AAll bachelors\nare unmarried@ is an instance of an a priori judgement; in Kant=s view F=ma is also a priori, derived\nfrom the concepts of force, mass and acceleration, respectively, and it would be foolish to try\ndisconfirming the formula by experiment. AAll professors are intelligent@ is an a posteriorijudgement; it\ndoes not follow from the concept Aprofessor@. In his ethical philosophy, Kant extends the distinction\nbetween a priori and a posteriori from judgements to the rules that determine courses of action.\n\nThe third proposition, which is a consequence of the two preceding, I would express thus: Duty\nis the necessity of acting from respect for the law. I may have inclination for an object as the effect of my\nproposed action, but I cannot have respect for the object just for this reason, that it is an effect [a state or\ncondition produced by action] and not an energy of will. Similarly I cannot have respect for inclination,\nwhether my own or another's; I can at most, if my own, approve it; if another's, sometimes even love it;\ni.e., look on it as favorable to my own interest. It is only what is connected with my will as a principle,\nby no means as an effect-- what does not subserve my inclination, but overpowers it, or at least in case of\nchoice excludes it from its calculation-- in other words, simply the law of itself, which can be an object of\nrespect, and hence a command. Now an action done from duty must wholly exclude the influence of\ninclination and with it every object of the will, so that nothing remains which can determine the will\nexcept objectively the law, and subjectively pure respect for this practical law, and consequently the\nmaxim3 that I should follow this law even to the thwarting of all my inclinations.\nThus the moral worth of an action does not lie in the effect expected from it, nor in any principle of action\nwhich requires to borrow its motive from this expected effect. For all these effectsCagreeableness of\none's condition and even the promotion of the happiness of othersCcould have been also brought about by\nother [sorts of] causes, so that for this there would have been no need of the will of a rational being;\nwhereas it is in this alone that the supreme and unconditional good can be found. The pre-eminent good\nwhich we call moral can therefore consist in nothing else than the conception of law in itself, which\ncertainly is only possible in a rational being, in so far as this conception, and not the expected effect,\ndetermines the will. This is a good which is already present in the person who acts accordingly, and we\nhave not to wait for it to appear first in the result.4\n3Kant has used the word Amaxim@ several times already. Here he adds a footnote, prompted by\nthe word subjective. AA maxim is the subjective principle of volition. The objective principle (i.e., that\nwhich would serve all rational beings also subjectively as a practical principle if reason had full power\nover the faculty of desire) is the practical law.@ In Kant=s terminology, maxims are rules of conduct,\nsome of which correspond to principles; principles are conceptions of laws; and laws are universal rules\nof conduct, valid for all rational beings.\n4It might be objected that I take refuge in an obscure feeling behind the word respect, instead of\ngiving a cleerly resolving the question by a concept of the reason. But although respect is a feeling, it is\nnot a feeling received hrough [external] influence but is self-wrought by a rational concept, and,\ntherefore, is specifically distinct from all feelings of the former kind, which may be referred either to\ninclination or fear, What I recognize immediately as a law for me, I recognize with respect, which merely\nsignifies the consciousness that my will is subordinate to a law, without the intervention of other\ninfluences on my mind. The direct determination of the will by the law, and the consciousness of this, is\ncalled respect, which is regarded as an effect of the law on the subject rather than as the cause of it.\nRespect is properly the conception of a worth which thwarts my self-love. Accordingly it is something\nwhich is considered neither as an object of inclination nor of fear, although it has something analogous to\nboth. . . .\n\nBut what sort of law can that be, the conception of which must determine the will, even without\npaying any regard to the effect expected from it, in order that this will may be called good absolutely and\nwithout qualification? As I have deprived the will of every impulse which could arise to it from obedience\nto any law, there remains nothing but the universal conformity of its actions to law in general, which\nalone is to serve the will as a principle, i.e., I am never to act otherwise than so that I could also will that\nmy maxim should become a universal law. Here, now, it is the simple conformity to law in general,\nwithout assuming any particular law applicable to certain actions, that serves the will as its principle and\nmust so serve it, if duty is not to be a vain delusion and a chimerical notion. The common reason of men\nin its practical judgements perfectly coincides with this and always has in view the principle here\nsuggested.\nLet the question be, for example: May I when in distress make a promise with the intention not to\nkeep it? I readily distinguish here between the two significations which the question may have: Whether it\nis prudent, or whether it is right, to make a false promise? The former may undoubtedly of be the case. I\nsee clearly indeed that it is not enough to extricate myself from a present difficulty by means of this\nsubterfuge, but it must be well considered whether there may not hereafter spring from this lie much\ngreater inconvenience than that from which I now free myself, and as, with all my supposed cunning, the\nconsequences cannot be so easily foreseen but that credit once lost may be much more injurious to me\nthan any mischief which I seek to avoid at present, it should be considered whether it would not be more\nprudent to act herein according to a universal maxim and to make it a habit to promise nothing except\nwith the intention of keeping it. But it is soon clear to me that such a maxim will still only be based on\nthe fear of consequences.\nNow to be truthful from duty wholly different thing from being truthful from fear of injurious\nconsequences. In the first case, the very notion of the action already implies a law for me; in the second\ncase, I must first look about elsewhere to see what results may be combined with it which would affect\nmyself. For to deviate from the principle of duty is beyond all doubt wicked; but to be unfaithful to my\nmaxim of prudence may often be very advantageous to me, although to abide by it is certainly safer. The\nshortest way, however, and an unerring one, to discover the answer to this question whether a lying\npromise is consistent with duty, is to ask myself, AShould I be content that my maxim (to extricate myself\nfrom difficulty by a false promise) should hold good as a universal law, for myself as well as for others?\nand should I be able to say to myself, AEvery one may make a deceitful promise when he finds himself in\na difficulty from which he cannot otherwise extricate himself?@ Then I presently become aware that\nwhile I can will the lie, I can by no means will that lying should be a universal law. For with such a law\nthere would be no promises at all, since it would be in vain to allege my intention in regard to my future\nactions to those who would not believe this allegation, or if they over hastily did so would pay me back in\nmy own coin. Hence my maxim, as soon as it should be made a universal law, would necessarily destroy\nitself.\nI do not, therefore, need any far-reaching penetration to discern what I have to do in order that my\nwill may be morally good. Inexperienced in the course of the world, incapable of being prepared for all\nits contingencies, I only ask myself: Canst thou also will that thy maxim should be a universal law? If not,\nthen it must be rejected, and that not because of a disadvantage accruing from it to myself or even to\nothers, but because it cannot enter as a principle into a possible universal legislation, and reason extorts\nfrom me immediate respect for such legislation. I do not indeed as yet discern on what this respect is\nbased (this the philosopher may inquire), but at least I understand this, that it is an estimation of the worth\nwhich far outweighs all worth of what is recommended by inclination, and that the necessity of acting\nfrom pure respect for the practical law is what constitutes duty, to which every other motive must give\nplace, because it is the condition of a will being good in itself, and the worth of such a will is above\neverything.\n\nThus, then, without quitting the moral knowledge of common human reason, we have arrived at\nits principle. And although, no doubt, common men do not conceive it in such an abstract and universal\nform, yet they always have it really before their eyes and use it as the standard of their decision. Here it\nwould be easy to show how, with this compass in hand, men are well able to distinguish, in every case\nthat occurs, what is good, what bad, conformably to duty or inconsistent with it, if, without in the least\nteaching them anything new, we only, like Socrates, direct their attention to the principle they themselves\nemploy; and that, therefore, we do not need science and philosophy to know what we should do to be\nhonest and good, yea, even wise and virtuous. Indeed we might well have conjectured beforehand that\nthe knowledge of what every man is bound to do, and therefore also to know, would be within the reach\nof every man, even the commonest. Here we cannot forbear admiration when we see how great an\nadvantage the practical judgement has over the theoretical in the common understanding of men. . . .\nInnocence is indeed a glorious thing; sad to say, it cannot well maintain itself and is easily led astray. On\nthis account even wisdomBwhich otherwise consists more in conduct than in knowledgeBstill needs\nscience, not to learn from it, but to make its precepts admissible and permanent. . . . In this respect,\ncommon human reason is compelled to go out of its sphere and to take a step into practical philosophy,\nnot to satisfy any speculative want [but] to attain information and clear instruction respecting the source\nof its principle, and the correct determination of it in opposition to maxims based on needs and [ever-\npowerful] inclinations. It seeks this information to escape the perplexity of opposite claims and not run\nthe risk of losing all genuine moral principles through the equivocation into which common human\nreasons easily falls. Thus, when practical reason cultivates itself . . . it will find rest nowhere but in a\nthorough critical examination of our reason.\nfrom Section Two\nOne could not give poorer counsel to morality than to attempt to derive it from examples.\nFor each\nexample of morality exhibited to me must itself have been previously judged according to principles of\nmorality to see whether it is worthy to serve as an original example. Even the Holy One of the Gospel\nmust be compared with our ideal of moral perfection before we can recognize him as such. . . . For the\npure conception of duty and the moral law generally, with no admixture of empirical inducements, has an\ninfluence on the human heart so much more powerful than all other incentives which may be derived\nfrom the empirical field that reason, in the consciousness of its dignity, despises them and gradually\nbecomes master over them. . . .\nEverything in nature works according to laws. Rational beings alone have the faculty of acting\naccording to the conception of laws, that is according to principles, i.e., have a will. This capacity is will.\nSince reason is required for the derivation of actions from laws, will is nothing else than practical reason.\nIf reason infallibly determines the will, the actions which such a being recognizes as objectively necessary\nare also subjectively necessary.\nThat is, the will is a faculty of choosing only that which reason,\nindependently of inclination, recognizes as practically necessary, i.e., as good.\nBut if reason of itself\ndoes not sufficiently determine the will, and if the will is subjugated to subjective conditions (motives,\nincentives) which do not always agree with objective conditionsCin other words, if the will is not of itself\nin complete accord with reason, which is the case with human beings, then the actions which are\nrecognized as objectively necessary are subjectively contingent, and the determination of such a will\naccording to objective laws is constraint, to which this will is not necessarily obedient.\nThe conception of an objective principle, in so far as it is obligatory for a will, is called a\ncommand (of reason), and the formula of the command is called an imperative.\nAll imperatives are\nexpressed by the word Aought@, and thereby indicate the relation of an objective law of reason to a will,\nwhich from its subjective constitution is not necessarily determined by it.\nSuch a will is under an\n\nobligation, which is constraint. Imperatives say that something would be good to do or to forbear, but\nthey say it to a will which does not always do a thing simply because it is presented as a good thing to do.\nThat is practically good, however, which determines the will by means of the conceptions of reason, and\nconsequently not from subjective causes, but objectively, that is on principles which are valid for every\nrational being as such. It is distinguished from the pleasant, which influences the will only by means of\nsensation from merely subjective causes, valid only for the sense of this person or that person, and not as\na principle of reason, which holds for everyone.\nThe dependence of the faculty of desire on sensations is called inclination, [which determines the\nwill according to contingencies having to do with need]. The dependence of the contingently determined\nwill on principles of reason, however, is called interest. Interest is present only in a dependent will,\nwhich is not of itself always in accord with reason. A perfectly good will would be just as subject to\nobjective laws (the laws of the good) as a contingently dependent will, but could not be conceived as\nobliged to act lawfully, because it can be determined only of itself [and never by contingent circumstance]\nin accord with the conception of good. Therefore no imperatives hold for the Divine will, or in general\nfor a holy will; Aought@ is here out of place, because the volition is already of itself necessarily in unison\nwith the law. (Likewise, in divine will we cannot conceive an interest.) It follows that imperatives are\nonly formulas expressing the relation of objective laws of all volition to the subjective imperfection of the\nwill of this or that rational being, e.g., the human will.\nNow, all imperatives command either hypothetically or categorically. The former represent the\npractical necessity of a possible action as means to something else that is willed (or at least which one\nmight possibly will). The categorical imperative would be that which represented an action as necessary\nof itself without reference to another end, i.e., as objectively necessary.\nSince every practical law\nrepresents a possible action as good and therefore necessary for a subject practically determinable by\nreason, all imperatives are formulas determining an action which is necessary according to the principle\nof a will good in at least some respects. If now the action is good only as a means to something else, then\nthe imperative is hypothetical; but if it is conceived as good in itself and consequently as being necessary\nin a will which of itself conforms to reason, then it is categorical.\nThus the imperative declares what action possible by me would be good and presents the practical\nrule in relation to the kind of will that does not forthwith perform an action simply because it is good,\nwhether because the subject does not always know that it is good, or because, even if it know this, yet its\nmaxims might be opposed to the objective principles of practical reason. Accordingly, the hypothetical\nimperative only says that the action is good for some purpose, possible or actual. In the first case it is a\nproblematical principle [i.e., of the sort, Aif you want to, etc., then you should CA], in the second an\nassertorial practical principle [i.e., of the sort, Asince in fact you do want to, etc., you must CA here the\nprinciple is dependent upon an assertion of fact]. The categorical imperative declares an action to be\nobjectively necessary in itself without reference to any purpose, i.e., without any other end; it is valid as\nan apodeictic5 (practical) principle. . . .\n5Without reference to any designated time or place; universal in reference.\n\nThere is one end which we may suppose that all rational beings have by necessity of nature. This\npurpose is happiness; and one might therefore think that the hypothetical imperative which represents the\npractical necessity of action as means to the promotion of happiness is assertorial. But it is a misfortune\nthat the concept of happiness is so indefinite that although each person wishes to attain it, he can never\ndefinitely and self-consistently state what it is that he really wishes and wills. The reason for this is that\nall the elements which belong to the notion of happiness are altogether empirical, i.e., they must be\nborrowed from experience, while the idea of happiness requires an absolute whole, a maximum of\nwelfare in all present and future circumstances. Now it is impossible that a finite being, even the most\nclear-sighted and powerful should frame to himself a definite conception of what he really wills in this;\nbecause to do so he would need to be omniscient. . . . Happiness is not an ideal of reason but of\nimagination, resting solely on empirical grounds, and it is vain to expect that these should define an action\nby which one could attain the totality of a series of consequences which is really endless. It is impossible\nfor any finite being to form here a definite concept of what he really wills, and so the imperatives of\nprudence do not, strictly speaking, command at all, because they cannot present actions objectively as\npractically necessary; they are to be regarded as counsels rather than precepts of reason. . . .\nWhen I conceive a hypothetical imperative, in general I do not know beforehand what it will\ncontain until I am given the condition under which it becomes an imperative. But when I conceive a\ncategorical imperative, I know at once what it contains. For as the imperative contains besides the law\nonly the necessity that maxims shall conform to this law, while the law [itself] contains no conditions\nrestricting it, there remains nothing but the general statement that the maxim of the action should conform\nto a universal law, and it is this conformity alone that the imperative properly represents as necessary.\nThere is therefore but one categorical imperative, namely, this: Act only on that maxim which you can at\nthe same time will that it should become a universal law.\nNow if all imperatives of duty can be derived from this one imperative as from their principle, we\ncan show what we understand by the concept duty and what it means, even before we have determined\nwhat in particular counts as duty.\nThe universality of law according to which effects are produced\nconstitutes what is properly called nature in the most general sense (as to form), that is, the existence of\nthings so far as it is determined by general laws; by analogy, then, the imperative of duty may be\nexpressed thus: Act as if the maxim of your action were to become by your will a universal law of nature.\nWe will now enumerate a few duties, adopting the usual division of them into duties to ourselves\nand ourselves and to others, and into perfect and imperfect duties.\n1. A man reduced to despair by a series of misfortunes feels wearied of life, but is still so far in\npossession of his reason that he can ask himself whether it would not be contrary to his duty to himself to\ntake his own life. Now he inquires whether the maxim of his action could become a universal law of\nnature. His maxim is: AFrom self-love I adopt it as a principle to shorten my life when its longer duration\nis likely to bring more evil than satisfaction.@ But it is questionable whetherthis principle founded on self-\nlove can become a universal law of nature, for we see immediately that a system of nature whose law\nwould be to destroy life by the very feeling whose special nature is to impel its improvement would\ncontradict itself. Such a nature could not exist as a system; hence that maxim cannot possibly exist as a\nuniversal law of nature and, consequently, would be wholly inconsistent with the supreme principle of all\nduty.\n2. Another finds himself forced by necessity to borrow money. He knows that he will not be\nable to repay it, but sees also that nothing will be lent to him unless he promises firmly to repay it in a\ndefinite time. He desires to make this promise, but he has still so much conscience as to ask himself: AIs\nit not unlawful and inconsistent with duty to get out of a difficulty in this way?@ Suppose however that he\nresolves to do so: then the maxim of his action would be expressed thus: AWhen I think myself in want of\n\nmoney, I will borrow money and promise to repay it, although I know that I never can do so.@ Now this\nprinciple of self-love or of one's own advantage may perhaps be consistent with my whole future welfare;\nbut the question now is, AIs it right?@ I change then the suggestion of self-love into a universal law, and\nstate the question thus: AHow would it be if my maxim were a universal law?@ Then I see at once that it\ncould never hold as a universal law of nature, but would necessarily contradict itself. For supposing it to\nbe a universal law that everyone in difficulty should be able to promise whatever he pleases, with the\npurpose of not keeping his promise, the promise itself would become impossible, as well as what it is\nsupposed to accomplish, since no one would consider that anything was promised to him, but would\nridicule all such statements as vain pretenses.\n3. A third finds in himself a talent which might if cultivated make him a useful man in many\nrespects. But he finds himself in comfortable circumstances and prefers to indulge in pleasure rather than\nto take pains in enlarging and improving his happy natural capacities. He asks, however, whether his\nmaxim of neglect of his natural gifts, besides agreeing with his inclination to indulgence, agrees also with\nwhat is called duty. He sees then that a system of nature could indeed subsist with such a universal law\nalthough men (like the South Sea islanders) should let their talents rest and resolve to devote their lives\nmerely to idleness, amusement, and propagation of their species-- in a word, to enjoyment; but he cannot\npossibly will that this should be a universal law of nature, or be implanted in us as such by a natural\ninstinct. For, as a rational being, he necessarily wills that his faculties be developed, since they are given\nhim for all sorts of possible purposes.\n4.\nA fourth, who is in prosperity, while he sees that others have to contend with great\nwretchedness and that he could help them, thinks: AWhat concern is it of mine? Let everyone be as happy\nas Heaven pleases, or as be can make himself; I will take nothing from him nor even envy him, only I do\nnot wish to contribute anything to his welfare or to his assistance in distress!@ Now no doubt if such a\nmode of thinking were a universal law, the human race might very well subsist and doubtless even better\nthan in a state in which everyone talks of sympathy and good-will, or even takes care occasionally to put\nit into practice, but, on the other side, also cheats when he can, betrays the rights of men, or otherwise\nviolates them. But although it is possible that a universal law of nature might exist in accordance with\nthat maxim, it is impossible to will that such a principle should have the universal validity of a law of\nnature. For a will which resolved this would contradict itself, inasmuch as many cases might occur in\nwhich one would have need of the love and sympathy of others, and in which, by such a law of nature,\nsprung from his own will, he would deprive himself of all hope of the aid he desires.\nThese are a few of the many actual duties, or at least what we regard as such, which obviously\nfall into two classes on the one principle that we have laid down. We must be able to will that a maxim of\nour action should be a universal law. This is the canon of the moral appreciation of the action generally.\nSome actions are of such a character that their maxim cannot without contradiction be even conceived as\na universal law of nature, far from it being possible that we should will that it should be so. In others this\nintrinsic impossibility is not found, but still it is impossible to will that their maxim should be raised to\nthe universality of a law of nature, since such a will would contradict itself.\nIt is easily seen that the\nformer violate strict or rigorous (inflexible) duty; the latter only laxer (meritorious) duty. Thus it has\nbeen completely shown how all duties depend as regards the nature of the obligation (not the object of the\naction) on the same principle. . . .\nThe will is conceived as a faculty of determining oneself to action in accordance with the conception of\ncertain laws. Such a faculty can be found only in rational beings. Now that which serves the will as the\nobjective ground of its self-determination is an end, and, if this is assigned by reason alone, it must hold\nfor all rational beings. On the other hand, that which merely contains the ground of possibility of the\naction whose effect is the end is the means. The subjective ground of the desire is the incentive, the\nobjective ground of the volition is the motive; hence the distinction between subjective ends which rest\n\non incentives, and objective ends which depend on motives valid for every rational being. Practical\nprinciples are formal when they disregard all subjective ends; they are material when they have particular\nincentives to action. The ends which a rational being arbitrarily proposes to himself as effects of his\nactions (material ends) are all only relative, for it is only their relation to the particular desires of the\nsubject that gives them their worth, and this worth cannot furnish principles universal and necessary for\nall rational beings and for every volition, that is to say, they cannot give rise to practical laws. Hence all\nthese relative ends can give rise only to hypothetical imperatives.\nSupposing, however, that there were something whose existence has in itself an absolute worth,\nsomething which, being an end in itself, could be a source of definite laws; then in this and this alone\nwould lie the source of a possible categorical imperative, i.e., a practical law. Now I say: man and\ngenerally any rational being exists as an end in himself, not merely as a means to be arbitrarily used by\nthis or that will. In all his actions, whether they concern himself or other rational beings, he must be\nalways regarded at the same time as an end. All objects of inclinations have only a conditional worth, for\nif the inclinations and the wants founded on them did not exist, then their object would be without value.\nBut the inclinations, themselves being sources of want, are so far from having an absolute worth for\nwhich they should be desired that on the contrary it must be the universal wish of every rational being to\nbe wholly free from them. Thus the worth of any object which is to be acquired by our action is always\nconditional. Beings whose existence depends not on our will but on nature's, have nevertheless, if they\nare irrational beings, only a relative value as means, and are therefore called things; rational beings, on\nthe contrary, are called persons, because their very nature points them out as ends in themselves, that is as\nsomething which must not be used merely as means, and so far therefore restricts freedom of action (and\nis an object of respect). These beings, therefore, are not merely subjective ends whose existence has a\nworth for us as an effect of our action, but objective ends, that is, things whose existence is an end in\nitself, an end of the sort for which no other end can be substituted, in relation to which they should count\nmerely as means. For otherwise nothing whatever would possess absolute worth; and if all worth is\nconditional and thus contingent, no supreme practical principle for reason could be found anywhere.\nIf then there is a supreme practical principle or, in respect of the human will, a categorical\nimperative, it must be one which, being drawn from the conception of that which is necessarily an end for\neveryone because it is an end in itself, constitutes an objective principle of will, and can therefore serve as\na universal practical law. The foundation of this principle is: rational nature exists as an end in itself.\nMan necessarily conceives his own existence as being so; so far then this is a subjective principle of\nhuman actions. But every other rational being regards its existence similarly, just on the same rational\nprinciple that holds for me: so that it is at the same time an objective principle, from which as a supreme\npractical law all laws of the will must be capable of being deduced. Accordingly the practical imperative\nwill be as follows: So act as to treat humanity, whether in your own person or in that of any other, in\nevery case as an end, never as means only. . . .\nThe conception of the will of every rational being as one which must consider itself as giving in all the\nmaxims of its will universal laws, so as to judge itself and its actions from this point of view--this\nconception leads to another which depends on it and is very fruitful, namely that of a kingdom of ends.\nBy a kingdom I understand the union of different rational beings in a system by common laws.\nNow since it is by laws that ends are determined as regards their universal validity, hence, if we abstract\nfrom the personal differences of rational beings and likewise from all the content of their private ends, we\nshall be able to conceive all ends combined in a systematic whole (including both rational beings as ends\nin themselves, and also the special ends which each may propose to himself), that is to say, we can\nconceive a kingdom of ends, which on the preceding principles is possible. For all rational beings come\nunder the law that each of them must treat itself and all others never merely as means, but in every case at\nthe same time as ends in themselves. Hence results a systematic union of rational being by common\n\nobjective laws, i.e., a kingdom which may be called a kingdom of ends, since what these laws have in\nview is just the relation of these beings to one another as ends and means. It is certainly only an ideal.\nA rational being belongs as a member to the kingdom of ends when, although giving universal\nlaws in it, he is also himself subject to these laws. He belongs to it as sovereign when, while giving laws,\nhe is not subject to the will of any other. A rational being must always regard himself as giving laws\neither as member or as sovereign in a kingdom of ends which is rendered possible by the freedom of will.\nHe cannot, however, maintain the latter position merely by the maxims of his will, but only in case he is a\ncompletely independent being without wants and with unrestricted power adequate to his will. [And no\nhuman being in the natural world meets this criterion.]\nMorality consists then in the reference of all action to the legislation which alone can render a\nkingdom of ends possible. This legislation must be capable of existing in every rational being and of\nemanating from his will, so that the principle of this will is never to act on any maxim which could not\nwithout contradiction be also a universal law and, accordingly, always so to act that the will could at the\nsame time regard itself as giving in its maxims universal laws. If now the maxims of rational beings are\nnot by their own nature coincident with this objective principle, then the necessity of acting on it is called\npractical constraint, i.e., duty. Duty does not apply to the sovereign in the kingdom of ends, but it does to\nevery member of it and to all in the same degree. The practical necessity of acting on this principle, i.e.,\nduty, does not rest at all on feelings, impulses, or inclinations, but solely on the relation of rational beings\nto one another, a relation in which the will of a rational being must always be regarded as legislative,\nsince otherwise it could not be conceived as an end in itself. Reason then refers every maxim of the will,\nregarding it as legislating universally, to every other will and also to every action towards oneself; and\nthis not on account of any other practical motive or any future advantage, but from the idea of the dignity\nof a rational being, obeying no law but that which he himself also gives.\nIn the kingdom of ends everything has either value or dignity. Whatever has a value can be\nreplaced by something else which is equivalent; whatever, on the other hand, is above all value, and\ntherefore admits of no equivalent, has a dignity. Whatever has reference to the general inclinations and\nwants of mankind has a market value; whatever, without presupposing a want, corresponds to a certain\ntaste, that is to a satisfaction in the mere purposeless play of our faculties, has an affective (sentimental)\nvalue; but that which constitutes the condition under which alone anything can be an end in itself does\nnot have merely relative worth, i.e., value, but an intrinsic worth, that is, dignity.\nNow morality is the condition under which alone a rational being can be an end in himself, since\nby this alone is it possible that he should be a legislating member in the kingdom of ends. Thus morality,\nand humanity as capable of it, is that which alone has dignity. Skill and diligence in labor have a market\nvalue; wit, lively imagination, and humor, have affective (sentimental) value; in contrast to both, fidelity\nto promises and benevolence from principle (not from instinct) have an intrinsic worth. Neither nature\nnor art contains anything which in default of these it could put in their place, for their worth consists not\nin the effects which spring from them nor in the use and advantage which they secure but in the\ndisposition of mind, that is, in maxims of the will, which are ready to manifest themselves in such actions,\neven though they should not have the desired effect. These actions need no recommendation from any\nsubjective taste or sentiment, that they may be looked on with immediate favor and satisfaction: they need\nno immediate propensity or feeling for them; they exhibit the will that performs them as an object of an\nimmediate respect, and nothing but reason is required to impose them on the will; the will is not to be\nflattered into them, which, in the case of duties, would be a contradiction. This esteem shows that the\nworth of such a disposition is dignity and places it infinitely above all value, with which it cannot for a\nmoment be brought into comparison or competition without as it were violating its sanctity.\nWhat then is it which justifies virtue or the morally good disposition, in making such lofty\n\nclaims? It is nothing less than the privilege it secures to the rational being of participating in the giving of\nuniversal laws, by which it qualifies him to be a member of a possible kingdom of ends, a privilege to\nwhich he was already destined by his own nature; as an end in himself he is destined to be legislative in\nthe kingdom of ends, free from all laws of physical nature, and obeying those only which he himself\ngives; his maxims can belong to a system of universal law, to which at the same time he submits himself.\nFor nothing has any worth [as opposed to value] except what the law assigns it. Therefore, the legislation\nthat determines the worth of everything must possess dignity, that is, an unconditional and incomparable\nworth; and the word Arespect@ alone supplies a becoming expression for the esteem which a rational\nbeing must have for it. Autonomy then is the basis of the dignity of human and of every rational nature. .\n. .\nAutonomy of the will is the property that the will has of being a law to itself, independently of\nany property of the objects of volition. The principle of autonomy is this: Always choose in such a way\nthat in the same volition the maxims of the choice are also comprehended as universal law. If the will\nseeks the law that is to determine it anywhere but in the fitness of its maxims for its own legislation of\nuniversal laws and thus goes outside of itself and seeks the law in the character of any of its objects, then\nheteronomy always results.\nThe will in that case does not give itself the law, but the object does so\nbecause of its relation to the will. This relation, whether it rests on inclination or on representations of\nreason, admits only of hypothetical imperatives: I ought to do this because I will that. In contrast, the\nmoral, and hence categorical, imperative says that I ought to act this way or that way, in any case. . . .\nfrom Section Three\n[The bulk of Section Three develops the idea that nature and freedom constitute two\nindependent aspects of the world and are viewed from two independent Astandpoints@.\nTheoretical reason deals with what we can know about the natural world by way of the\nlaws governing empirical events but offers no insight into the >mechanics= of freedom.\nCorrespondingly, while rational beings must understand the world through understanding\nits mechanical principles, they can never think freedom away, for positing its freedom is\nan a priori condition of any rational being knowing the world at all.]\n\nThe will is a kind of causality belonging to living beings in so far as they are rational, and\nfreedom would be the property attributed to such causality of being effective independently of\nforeign causes determining it; just as physical necessity is the property attributed to the kind of\ncausality that determines the activity of all irrational beings by the influence of foreign causes. .\n. . What else then can freedom of the will be but autonomy, that is, the property of the will to be\na law to itself? The proposition: AThe will is in every action a law to itself,@ only expresses the\nprinciple: ATo act on no other maxim than that which can also have as an object itself as a\nuniversal law.@ Now this is precisely the formula of the categorical imperative and is the\nprinciple of morality, so that a free will and a will subject to moral laws are one and the same. . .\n.\nIt is not enough to attribute freedom to our own will, from whatever reason, if we have\nnot sufficient grounds for predicating the same of all rational beings. For as morality serves as a\nlaw for us only as we are rational beings, it must also hold valid for all rational beings; and as it\nmust derive exclusively from the property of freedom, freedom must be shown to be a property of\nall rational beings. It is not enough, then, to derive freedom from certain supposed experiences of\nhuman nature (which indeed is quite impossible, and it can only be shown a priori), but we must\nshow that it belongs to the activity of all rational beings endowed with a will. Now I say every\nbeing that cannot act except under the idea of freedom is thereby really free from the standpoint\nof practical reason. That is to say, all laws which are inseparably connected with freedom have\nthe same force for that being as if its will had been shown to be free in itself by a theoretically\nconclusive proof. Now I affirm that we must grant that every rational being who has a will has\nalso the idea of freedom and acts entirely under this idea. For in such a being we conceive a\nreason that is practical, that is, has causality in reference to its objects. [But the objects of reason,\npractical or theoretical, are judgements.] Now we cannot possibly conceive a reason consciously\nreceiving a bias from any other quarter with respect to its judgements, for then the subject would\nascribe the determination of its judgement [whether of theoretical matters or of questions of\npractice] not to its own reason, but to an impulse. Reason must regard itself as the author of its\nprinciples independent of foreign influences. Consequently as practical reason or as the will of a\nrational being it must regard itself as free, that is to say, the will of a rational being cannot be a\nwill of its own except under the idea of freedom. This idea must therefore from the standpoint of\npractical reason be ascribed to every rational being."
