  "syllabus_content": "Course Meeting Times\n\nLectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session\n\nSyllabus Archive\n\nThe following syllabi come from a variety of different terms. They illustrate the evolution of this course over time, and are intended to provide alternate views into the instruction of this course.\n\nFall 2002, Christopher Capozzola (\nPDF\n)\n\nIntroduction\n\nWriting in the wake of the Civil War, poet Walt Whitman insisted that \"the real war will never get in the books.\" Throughout American history, the experience of war has fundamentally shaped the ways that Americans think about themselves, their fellow Americans, and the meanings of national citizenship. War has also posed challenges of representation, both for those who fought as well as those who did not. This subject examines how Americans have told the stories of modern war in history, literature, and popular culture, and interprets them in terms of changing ideas about American national identity.\n\nRequirements\n\nThe success of this class depends on the active participation of all students. Classroom participation (15%) represents a substantial portion of the grade, and will be evaluated in terms of preparation, participation, active listening, collaboration, and overall contributions to the class experience during the term. Needless to say, if you do not attend a class it is impossible for you to contribute to it. In addition, all students will choose reading assignments and lead discussion (10%) during the last two weeks of the semester.\n\nWriting assignments are frequent, but short: the first 1-2 pp. paper is ungraded, and is followed by three essays of 4-5 pp. (25% each). Writing assignments should be handed in on paper in person at the beginning of the class in which they are due. Extensions will be granted only for good reasons explained well in advance; computer malfunctions are never an acceptable excuse for a late submission. Please be sure to familiarize yourself with MIT's regulations on academic honesty and ask questions if anything is unclear.\n\nBooks\n\nCopies of required books for the class have been placed on reserve at the Humanities Library. A number of readings will also be made available through the library's electronic reserve system (accessible through the class website) or by handout. Readings should be completed by the beginning of the class under which they appear, unless otherwise stated. At times, homework assignments require you to watch films. Course films are on reserve at the Film Office of the Comparative Media Studies Program; they can also easily be found at commercial video rental stores in the area.",

Extensions will be granted only for good reasons explained well in advance. Computer\nmalfunctions are never an acceptable excuse for a late submission. Proper academic citation is required,\nbut you may use whichever standard style you prefer. I will make comments and put a check, check plus,\nor check minus to give you a sense of how you've done, but that mark does not count toward your final\ngrade--unless you don't do it at all or turn it in late.\nThe assignment is relatively open-ended. Consider the original documents by Abraham Lincoln that you\nare reading for class today. In conjunction with the historical account of the Civil War era in Mark E.\nNeely, Jr., The Last Best Hope of Earth: Abraham Lincoln and the Promise of America, write a response\npaper on a topic of your choosing.\nYou may focus on any aspect of the war and its intersection with Lincoln's texts that you wish: political,\nmilitary, social, even literary. You may wish to examine a particular theme or issue - civil liberties,\nwartime presidential leadership, the question of slavery - and use the documents to make a claim. Or you\nmay wish to juxtapose two documents that share something in common. Whatever you do, be clear in\nyour view on the theme you choose, state it clearly in the opening paragraph, and use direct quotations\nfrom the original works to demonstrate your points."

It is due in\nclass in Class #18 unless you make alternate arrangements. As I said in class, I am amenable to a\ndifferent due date, but I encourage you to choose Class#17 just to give you more time to focus on\nother classes at the end of term. Any changes in due date must be arranged in advance.\nFor a variety of reasons, the Vietnam War is often described as an exception in the history of\nAmerican war. Write an essay in which you consider whether the readings and films that we\nhave considered support or challenge this interpretation.\nDo you see continuities between representations of the Vietnam War and previous wars that we\nhave studied? If so, explain what patterns of continuity you see, giving specific examples from\ndifferent works to support your point.\nOr do you see a sharp break in the representations of the Vietnam War? If you take this position,\nbe sure to explain the nature of the differences you see as most important between Vietnam\nnarratives and those of earlier wars, giving specific examples from different works to support\nyour point.\nThe focus of this essay is primarily on the Vietnam War, but you may choose to write about the\nPersian Gulf War or the current war in Afghanistan if you think these represent a more\nsignificant turning point. If you choose to do this, I will definitely be open to an alternate due\ndate for the paper."

The aim of this\nassignment is to use give historical and cultural context to contemporary events. You will be reporting on\ncurrent events, but analyzing them with the critical tools and historical awareness that your knowledge of\nAmerican history provides. Think about it in a larger time frame: how will history students twenty or fifty\nyears from now analyze these sources? What do they reveal about how war has shaped Americans, and\nhow Americans have shaped war?\nThere will be a few different presentations on the following days: Class #22, Class #23, Class #24. Each\nperson can present for as long as they wish, but certainly for at least fifteen minutes and no more than\ntwenty minutes. Your task is to present us with an overview of the issues surrounding your particular\ntopic, and to lead a discussion on a topic and document or set of documents that future students of\nAmerican history might turn to as they study these events. It is completely up to you what these document\nare, but in your presentation, your task will be not so much to give a presentation as to provoke and guide\na discussion of the material and issues raised by it. The class will be in your capable hands during that\ntime.\nIn advance, you should let me know what you would like the rest of the class to examine on your topic.\nThis can be a website that you have uncovered, or an article, ideally nothing too long. If you would like to\ncirculate a published article, you need to get it to me in advance so that I can scan it and put it on the class\nhomepage. Possible topics include:\nDebates on the war within conservative publications.\nDebates on the war within left-wing publications.\nResponses of Arab-Americans to the war.\nResponses of American Jewish groups to the war and the crisis in Israel.\nResponses of women's organizations to the war and to women under the Taliban.\nResponses of Christian fundamentalists.\nLegal issues surrounding civil liberties, military tribunals, the USA Patriot Act, etc.\nPresident Bush as statesman: his speeches, etc.\nBaseball (or other sports) respond to September 11.\nImpact of the war on college campuses and debates within universities.\nMemory and American culture: proposals for a September 11 memorial.\nCoverage of America and the war in the foreign press."
