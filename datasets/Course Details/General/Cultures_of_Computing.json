Students read classic texts in computer science along with cultural analyses of computing history and contemporary configurations. It explores the history of automata, automation and capitalist manufacturing; cybernetics and WWII operations research; artificial intelligence and gendered subjectivity; robots, cyborgs, and artificial life; creation and commoditization of the personal computer; the growth of the Internet as a military, academic, and commercial project; hackers and gamers; technobodies and virtual sociality. Emphasis is placed on how ideas about gender and other social differences shape labor practices, models of cognition, hacking culture, and social media.",

Students read cultural analyses of historical and contemporary computing worlds alongside influential texts in computer science. Students explore the history of automation and capitalist manufacturing; cybernetics and WWII operations research; artificial intelligence and gendered subjectivity; the creation and commoditization of the personal computer; the growth of the Internet as a military, academic, and commercial project; the making of new social and economic forms online; the worlds of hackers and gamers; technobodies and virtual sociality; robots and new material substrates for computing. Emphasis is placed on how ideas about gender and other social differences shape labor practices, models of cognition, and material and symbolic practices of networking.\n\nRequirements\n\nStudents will write three 7-page papers. For the third paper, students choose an artifact from the history of computing or from the contemporary world of computing and write an essay about the social meaning of this artifact; appropriate examples include the punch card, the listserv, iCloud, Kinect. Students deliver an in-class presentation on their third paper, on the last day of class. Each of the three assignments represents 25% of the subject grade. No extensions without a documented medical or personal excuse. Late papers lose a full grade a day. Students will also be evaluated on class participation, including discussion and in-class writing exercises (25% of grade). Punctual attendance obligatory. There is no final.\n\nGrading\n\nACTIVITY\n\nPERCENTAGE\n\nPaper 1\n\n25%\n\nPaper 2\n\n25%\n\nPaper 3 and Presentation\n\n25%\n\nIn-class Participation\n\n25%\n\nCalendar\n\nSES #\n\nTOPICS\n\nKEY DATES\n\nIntroduction\n\nMedieval & Renaissance Cosmology, Clockwork, Cross-Cultural Connections\n\nThe Industrial Revolution and Calculating Engines: Analytics of Capital and Gender Difference in the Work of Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace\n\nWorld War Two and the Cold War: Cybernetics, Communication, and Control\n\nArtificial Intelligence, Artificial Life, Cognition, Gender\n\nPaper 1 due\n\nComputing and Proof\n\nGuest lecture: Stephanie Dick, Harvard University History of Science\n\nComputing Countercultures: Early PCs, Hacking, Opensources, Wikiworlds\n\nComputer Graphics and Simulation\n\nGuest lecture: Alma Steingart\n\nPaper 2 due\n\nSocial Networks, Media, and Gaming\n\nMaterialities of Networks and Wireless Connections\n\nRobots, DNA Computing, Quantum Computing, Beyond\n\nClass Conference\n\nPaper 3 due",
