In studying animals we can learn about our\nown nature as well.\n-\nAnimals are important for humans in many ways; in basic\nscience, they serve as models--stand-ins for humans.\n(More about this later.)\n\nAnimal Behavior: getting started\n-\nWe begin the class at the undergraduate survey level.\n-\nIn the second half, we will reach the level of a\n\"special topics\" seminar, with student reports during\nthe last group of classes.\nBe sure you have access to the course web site.\nCheck all online documents regularly.\n\n9.20 Organization\n1.\nOrganization, requirements\n-\nQuizzes; homework\n-\nMidterm exam\n-\nReport: Written Powerpoint document; oral presentation\n-\nFinal exam\n2.\nKey concepts in studies of animal behavior, emphasizing\nethology\n\nReadings from Scott (2005), supplemented by selections from other\nbooks, especially from classics in the field (Tinbergen, Lorenz)\n\nSelected videos\n3.\nKey concepts in sociobiology\n\nReadings from Alcock (2001), supplemented by selections from other\nbooks and some video presentations.\n\nKey ideas from E.O. Wilson.\n4.\nStudent reports\n\nExamples of specific topics\n- Habitat selection; nest site selection; territoriality; dispersal;\nmigration.\n- Feeding. Foraging or stalking; prey capture; storage/hoarding.\n- Antipredator behavior. Detection; tricking the predator;\ndefenses -- individual, social; other adaptations.\n- Sexuality. Dimorphisms in body and behavior; social\norganization, dominance structures; evolution of sexual signals\nwith emancipation from original uses.\n- Mating and reproduction. Pair bonding varieties and\nadvantages; brood tending and its evolution; similarities of\nemancipated actions across widely different species.\n- Animal communication and social organization\n- Cooperation among conspecifics\n- Tool use\n\nExamples of specific questions & concepts\n- What is instinctive behavior?\n- How is a fixed action pattern organized?\n- Why do some animals migrate very long distances every year?\n- What is the meaning of sexual selection and natural selection?\n- What is the evolutionary origin of kissing?\n- Why would an animal behaviorist engage in gene counting?\n- What is a \"Darwinian puzzle\"?\n- Why is infanticide common in some animals? Explain how it\ncan be adaptive.\n- Why might a worker ant behave differently depending on\nwhether its queen is monogamous or not?\n\nStudent reports\n-\nSome but not all student projects will be\non topics not covered in class. However:\n-\nStudents are expected to interpret the\nbehaviors they study for their reports in\nterms of principles and concepts discussed\nin class.\n\nReadings\n1.\nList of books (posted on course website): 2 small textbooks\nplus books for selected readings; many others we will not\nhave time to read despite their value.\n2.\nEffort expected outside of class: readings, study questions.\n\nPosted study questions are often used on quizzes and for\nhomework assignments\n\nTry to answer the study Qs prior to class time if possible.\n3.\nRead for key concepts & their illustration in specific\nexamples.\n4.\nSelections from a book by Jim Corbett are posted under\nsession 1 (today's session): These illustrate the knowledge\nand contributions of amateur naturalists to animal behavior\n5.\nAssignments for next session (posted on course website):\n-\nGraham Scott ch 1.\n-\nChapter 11 from Tinbergen's book Curious Naturalists.\n-\nStudy questions on these readings.\n\nSession plan\n1.\nLecture/discussion of key concepts in readings,\nusually beginning with the study questions.\n2.\nSome sessions will include viewing of selected\nvideos.\n3.\nStudent observations, questions, discussion\n4.\nFinal sessions: student reports using Powerpoint\nslides. Plan: divide class into three parts. Reports\nwill be evaluated by an instructor and by other\nstudents.\n\n`\n-\nPets, hobbies, encounters in nature and at zoological parks\nand in films\n-\nAnimals in folklore have a long history\n*\nThe \"medieval bestiaries\"--more imagination than\nreality, but more accurate knowledge of animals was present\nin the medieval period according to recent historical studies.\n*\nBeliefs about rats: See examples in R. Hendrikson, More\nCunning Than Man: A Social History of Rats and Men,\nDorset Press, N.Y., 1983.\n-\nExamples of how rats have caused people to hate them,\nand sometimes animals in general\n-\nAnimals have also been blamed falsely for spread of\ndisease: e.g., stories of the bubonic plague (How was\nplague actually spread?)\n-\nNot all rodents are hated so much, e.g., hamsters, gerbils\nHow have we learned of animals and their behavior?\n\nHow have we learned of animals and their behavior?\n(continued)\nPets, other personal encounters\nFolklore\n- Human uses of animals\n- Meat, leather industries\n- Knowledge of animal behavior has improved the treatment of\nanimals in the slaughterhouses--e.g., the influence and consulting\nby Temple Grandin\n- Sports; hunting; some religions\n- Uses by scientists (Biology; comparative psychology;\npharmacology; toxicology; neuroscience; neuro-\nengineering)\n\nHow have we learned of animals and their behavior?\ncontinued\n-\nHumane society; \"animal rights\" movement:\nHuman oriented in a different way\n→Anthropomorphism re cognition and feelings\n(\"anthropomentism\", \"anthropaffectism\")\n→Regard for apparent consciousness, in humans and other\nanimals (necessarily subjectively assessed)\n-\nContrasting attitudes in different religions. The\nextremes of Judaism/Christianity and Jainism.\n-\nBasic science approaches in this class:\n-\nBoth descriptive and experimental,\n-\nwith the perspective of evolution.\n\nScientific approaches to the study of\nanimal behavior\n1.\nFocus on the individual organism\n2.\nFocus on societies\n3.\nFocus on habitat and the species it supports, and\ninteractions (\"balance\")\n4.\nFocus on single species or groups of species in a\nbroad way that includes ecology and behavior\n5.\nThe amateur \"naturalists\": The disciplined\nhobbyist's contributions\n\nScientific approaches to the study of\nanimal behavior\n1. Focus on the individual organism\na.\n\"Comparative Psychology\" in America: history\n*\nThe real focus was/is on humans. Learning was the main\ntopic of study, using (mostly) rats and mice as models.\n*\nThis was encouraged by popularity of the ideas of John\nDewey (1859-1952) and universal education in America.\nEmphasis on practicality, and on the shaping of the\nindividual through learning.\n*\nThe idea of the blank slate at birth. The learning theorists\nand their goals.\n*\nCf. contrasting attitudes in Europe, with a different\nhistory.\n\nScientific approaches to the study of animal behavior\n1. Focus on the individual organism\na.\n\"Comparative psychology\" in America\nb. Ethology\n-\nDefinition by Konrad Lorenz: see The Foundations of\nEthology\n\np.1: \"...it is the discipline which applies to the behavior of\nanimals and humans all those questions asked and those\nmethodologies used as a matter of course in all the other\nbranches of biology since Charles Darwin's time.\"\n\np. 101: \"Ethology, or the comparative study of behavior, is\nbased on the fact that there are mechanisms of behavior\nwhich evolve in phylogeny exactly as organs do, so that the\nconcept of homology can be applied to them as well as to\nmorphological structures.\" (Also see p 3, 65.)\n-\nOrigins in ornithology [next]\n\n- Origins in ornithology:\n\nWhitman and Heinroth (Stories from Lorenz,\nibid., p.100, 107)\n-\nCharles Otis Whitman (1898, 1919) kept a\ncollection of doves and pigeons in aviaries.\n-\nOskar Heinroth (1910, 1928, 1930) studied the rich\ncollection of waterfowl kept at the Berlin Zoo.\n-\nThey independently discovered that motor\npatterns, just like morphological characteristics,\ncan be inherited, and can be homologous across\ndifferent species.\n\n-\nCf. Charles Darwin: Illustrations from his book\n\nEthology, continued:\n\nFrom Charles Darwin, The Expression of the Emotions in\nMan and Animals\nDog approaching another dog with hostile intentions (fig 5)\nImage is in public domain.\n\nFrom Charles Darwin, The Expression of the Emotions\nin Man and Animals\nThe same dog in a humble and affectionate frame of mind (fig. 6)\nImage is in public domain.\n\nFrom Charles Darwin,\nThe Expression of the\nEmotions in Man and\nAnimals\n\nThe idea of inherited\nmovement patterns was\napplied to human\nbehavior also.\nPhotos are in public domain.\n\nScientific approaches to the study of animal behavior\n1.\nFocus on the individual organism\nb.\n\"Ethology\"\n-\nDefinition by K. Lorenz: see The Foundations of Ethology\n-\nWhitman and Heinroth\n-\nCf. Charles Darwin: Illustrations from his book\n-\n\"Human ethology\" of Eibl-Eibesfeldt (book, 1989)\n-\nSee K.L., pp.10-11\n-\nNote the popular \"body language\" craze...\n-\n\"Neuroethology\"-- an approach that goes two ways:\n-\nEthology informs brain & behavior studies.\n-\nBrain manipulation effects provide new info. on behavioral\norganization.\n»\nExamples: multiple kinds of aggression; evidence of\nprimitive vs. advanced behavioral elements\n(spinal/brainstem vs. forebrain localization).\n\n2. Focus on societies\na.\n\"Sociobiology\" (E.O. Wilson, 1975, 1980): study of the\nbiological basis of social behavior in every species. See\nSociobiology, The Abridged Edition, pp. 3-5.\n-\nWilson envisioned the field very broadly, \"compounded of\nroughly equal parts of invertebrate zoology, vertebrate\nzoology, and population biology.\"\n-\nAs an empirical science, it has focused largely on studies of\nadaptive functions of animal behaviors of all sorts. (Adaptation\nmeans promoting gene survival and proliferation.)\nb. Cf. sociology and cultural anthropology\n-\n\"Sociology...still stands apart from sociobiology because of its\nlargely structuralist and nongenetic approach.\" (E.O. Wilson,\nIbid., p.4)\nScientific approaches to the study of animal behavior\n\n\"Behavioral Biology\"\n\nFrom E. O. Wilson (1975),\nSociobiology (See The Abridged\nEdition (1980), p. 4)\n\n*Concerning Wilson's\nprediction: By 2013, these fields\nhave not diminished much but they\nhave been more integrated with\nsociobiology. Brain-behavior\nstudies (neuropsychology,\ncognitive neuroscience) have\nbecome more influenced by studies\nof evolution.\nDiagram removed due to copyright restrictions.\n\nScientific approaches to the study of animal behavior\n3.\nFocus on habitat and the species it supports, and\ntheir interactions (\"balance\")\na.\n\"Ecology\": for example,\n-\nTropical rainforest (wet forest) (see Tropical Nature, by A.\nForsyth and K. Miyata)\n-\nOther eco-regions: Tropical savannah; temperate rain forest\n(wet forest); Alaska tundra; warm deserts; cold deserts; etc.\n-\nAnimals are a part of each habitat.\nb. The problem of breadth: Knowing too little about\neverything.\n-\nHence, people often think of ecology as focused on\n\"conservation\".\n-\nBut there are good examples of ecology as a science that\nincludes animal behavior: See books on modern \"behavioral\necology\".\n-\nWhen the behavior of animals becomes critical: \"Upsetting the\nbalance of nature.\" Examples: African elephants and the acacia\ntrees. Human hunting, pollution effects, pleasures that\nencourage poaching, conversion of forests to farmland. Wolf\npredation in cattle ranches.\n\n4. Focus on single species or groups of species\nin a broad way that includes ecology and\nbehavior\n-\n\"Mammalogy\" (origins, characteristics, classifications,\nbehavior, ecology)\n-\n\"Primatology\", \"cetology\", \"entymology\", etc.\nScientific approaches to the study of animal behavior\n\nExample topics from a mammalogy book\n(Francois Bourliere, The Natural History of Mammals)\n- Running speeds of land mammals\n- Submersion times of aquatic mammals and\namphibians\n- Tunnel structures of burrowing mammals\n- Composition of milk in various mammals\n- Biomass of animals in various habitats\n\n5.\nThe amateur \"naturalists\": The disciplined\nhobbyist's contributions (cf. astronomy)\n-\nDetails, when amassed, have been important in the\ndevelopment of ideas about behavioral evolution.\n-\nSee Lorenz's comments about the contributions of\namateur ornithologists -- bird watchers -- to early\nethology: Charles Otis Whitman & Oskar Heinroth\n-\nJim Corbett's stories (Jungle Lore, Oxford Univ. Press,\n1953)\n\nExamples from the life of a hunter who cared about animals:\nStudents should read the two selections posted on the web\nsite, under the first class.\nScientific approaches to the study of animal behavior\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n9.20 Animal Behavior\nFall 2013\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

Hawks and other raptors are seen\nrelatively rarely in comparison to birds with goose and duck\nshapes. The most novel stimulus patterns are the ones that cause the anti-predator\nresponses.\n\nIn addition, these birds are able to learn from experience to fear\ncertain birds and other animals.\n\nScott ch 2,\n\"Controlling behavior: the role of the nervous system\"\n1.

Give\nexamples. (Scott uses \"reflex\" to mean automatic and at least initially\nunlearned.)\n\nKonrad Lorenz' term \"Action Specific Potential\" is an internal level of\nactivation of a drive. It has been called a \"central motive state\" by Peter Milner\n(Canadian physiological psychologist), and a \"drive\" by many others.\n\nAn ASP builds up over time, increasing the probabilility of discharge of the\nmotor action. Stimulus thresholds for eliciting the fixed motor pattern become\nlowered more and more as the ASP increases.\n\nThis happens for FAPs, not for reflexes. The threshold for triggering a reflex\ncan change, but it does not become lowered over time as some internal state\nchanges by an endogenous build-up.\n\nThe \"mantle of reflexes\" are something an animal is always \"wearing\" -- it is\npart of the routine maintenance activity of the nervous system. Reflexes do not\nhave an underlying motivation that builds up inexorably over time.\n\nScott ch 2,\n\"Controlling behavior: the role of the nervous system\"\n3.\nGive an example of a \"supernormal stimulus\" that\nacts as a releaser of a fixed action pattern in herring\ngull chicks.

The text mentions\nanother possible measure, in terms of levels of\ncertain hormones. From the text description, could\nthese levels be an adequate explanation of hunger?\nWhy or why not?\n\nCorrelates of hunger\n- Two hormones: leptin and ghrelin, are found in humans and other\nmammals.\n- Leptin is released by adipocytes, and can indicate the level of\nstored energy in fat. High levels suppress appetite (by influences\non hypothalamus).\n- Low levels of leptin cause stomach to secrete ghrelin, which\nstimulates appetite by action on hypothalamus.\n\n- Explanation of hunger motivation?\nLasker Award, 2010: Jeffrey M. Friedman, M.D., has been awarded the prestigious Albert\nLasker Award for Basic Medical Research. Dr. Friedman is head of the Laboratory of\nMolecular Genetics at Rockefeller University and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute\nInvestigator.\nDr. Friedman shares the award with Douglas L. Coleman, emeritus scientist at The Jackson\nLaboratory, for the pair's discovery of leptin, a hormone that regulates food intake and body\nweight.\n\nDoes this explain hunger motivation?\n- It is a means of long-term regulation, but the levels\ndo not change rapidly enough to explain many\naspects of feeding behavior.\n- There are also various short-term regulators, e.g., of\nmeal size and timing.\nSignals from throat, stomach and intestines reach the brain\nvia the glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves (cranial nerves\n9 and 10)\nExperimental studies of the role of these signals in feeding\nbehavior\n- Esophagus fistula: Food does not reach stomach but the animal\nstill eats meals of a limited size.\n- Subdiaphragmatic vagotomy in rats made hyperphagic by lesions of\nthe ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus can abolish the overeating\n(at least when the rats are fed on lab chow).\n\nResearch on leptin (from HHMI 2003)\n- Many hoped that simple injections would control obesity, but this\nworked, to some degree at least, in only 15-20% of obese\nhumans. Amgen gave up on it.\n- However, it proved to be useful in treating rarer diseases:\n- Administration to very obese children who constantly crave food, and have\na defective leptin gene: They respond dramatically, and become much\nmore normal.\n- Effective in treating the insulin resistance that occurs in some type 2\ndiabetics.\n- One speculation: The many, seemingly unrelated effects of\nleptin... may have evolved to provide a \"link between the\nnutritional state and the physiology and behavior of an animal,\"\nenabling it to adapt to starvation.\n\n- Thus, even though leptin did not live up to initial expectations\nthat it would cure obesity, it has since proved to be an\ninvaluable research and therapeutic tool. Peter J. Havel, a\nnutrition researcher at the University of California, Davis, says\nthat by \"demonstrating that body weight is a physiological\nparameter regulated by hormones, leptin opened up the whole\nfield of obesity research.\" Leptin experiments, O'Rahilly adds,\nhave debunked the notion that obesity results from people's\n\"immorality, behavior and gluttony.\"\n- There is a recently updated article on leptin in Wikipedia (2011)\n- Recent scholarly review of research:\n- Berthoud H, Lenard NR, Shin AC (2011) Food reward, hyperphagia, and\nobesity.

(1981) The Foundations of Ethology\n1.\nIn early writings and discussions concerning fixed\nmotor patterns (fixed action patterns, or FAPs), the\nconcept embraced three physiologically different\nfunctions. What are they? (Section 1)\n\nSee p 108\n\nThe \"fixed action pattern\":\nThree distinct processes, normally integrated:\n1.\nThe motivation--or \"drive\"--to search for a certain\nstimulus situation.\n-\nLorenz' term: the action-specific potential (ASP)\n2.\nThe selective response to it: its \"innate recognition\"\nvia the innate releasing mechanism (IRM)\n3.\nThe discharge of an innate motor activity coping\nwith the situation: the fixed motor pattern\nTry drawing simple information-flow models of\na) a reflex, and b) a fixed action pattern\n\nLowest\nthreshold\nHighest\nthreshold\nEndogenous\ninput\n\nLorenz, K.Z. (1981) The Foundations of Ethology\n2.\nWhat are \"intention movements\" in relation to fixed\naction patterns? Give an example from animal\nbehavior. Also describe human intention\nmovements with at least one example. (Section 2)\n\nSee p 110-111\nMovements made prior to a full fixed motor pattern,\nthat give away the intention of the animal (or person) to\ncarry out the movement.\n\nOn the evolution of social signals:\n- Intention movements can evolve \"on their\nown\" if they come to serve as important social\nsignals.\n- Ritualized aggression among conspecifics\nmust have arisen this way.\n\nRemember the jackdaws and the kittiwakes\nThey have evolved into elaborate courtship rituals in\nsome bird species.\n\nLorenz, K.Z. (1981) The Foundations of Ethology\n3.\nIn the case of complex FAPs involving a series of\ndifferent movements, how can we be sure that we\nare dealing with a single FAP rather than a series of\ndifferent ones? Give two or three of Lorenz'\narguments. (Section 4; see p 113-115)\n\nLorenz on the unity of motivation\n1.\nConsistent predictability: The experienced ethologist can reliably predict\nthe next movement in a series, e.g., Seitz' demonstrations of cichlid\nfighting behavior.\n2.\nAs intensity increases, there may occur quick switches between two\npatterns, but the sequence is always clear. Intention movements\nanticipating the next stage can mix with the actions of the previous stage.\n3.\nOne stage moves smoothly to the next without the inertia normally shown\nin switching between FAPs.\n4.\nThe same stimulus configuration elicits all the motor patterns. (Also, in\nbrain stimulation studies, the whole sequence can be elicited from the\nsame locus.)\n5.\nThe organism's readiness to perform any one part of the sequence of\nmovements fluctuates in parallel with its readiness to perform any other.\nOne never sees a higher intensity movement immediately followed by one\nof lower intensity. If a strong stimulus can elicit only the earlier, weaker\nmovements, no stimulus will be able to elicit the later, higher intensity\npatterns.\nThe unity may not be present early in development; it may increase with experience.\nThe same \"mood\" is behind all of the movements.\n\nLorenz, K.Z. (1981) The Foundations of Ethology\n4.\nSummarize Seitz' method of dual quantification, used to\nassess the effectiveness of a dummy stimulus. Seitz used\nthis method in studies of fighting behavior of one species of\nmale fish, and it has been used for other studies as well.\n(Section 5, p 115-117)\n\nThe key to his method is that there are two variables in any\nexperiment using dummy stimuli: a readiness (the ASP) which\ndecreases with every performance, and a varying efficacy of\ndifferent stimulus configurations.\n\nAssuming these two variable, what was his method?\n\nThe method allows one to test for effectiveness of dummy stimuli\nusing animals with various levels of internal readiness (drive,\nASP level)\n\nSeitz' method of dual quantification\n-\nPresent the dummy stimulus; observe the response.\n-\nThen, present a stimulus known to be maximally effective.\nHow much drive is left?\n-\n\"The greater the effect of the dummy, the weaker was the subsequent\nresponse to the maximum stimulation\"\n-\nNote that the same actions could be produced by\n-\na strong internal readiness (ASP) and a weak external stimulation,\n-\na weaker ASP and a stronger stimulus.\n\nRequired: extensive knowledge of the FAP, so that some\nlevel of quantification of drive intensity level is possible\n\nLorenz, K.Z. (1981) The Foundations of Ethology\n5. One of Seitz' findings was the \"law of\nheterogenous summation\". What does this\nphrase mean?\n\n(p 117; see also p 116 on innate recognition\nof another animal of the same species.)\n\nSeitz' law of heterogenous summation\nEffectiveness of the stimulus is the linear sum of the\neffectiveness of the three key stimuli (or another\nnumber) acting separately\n\nLorenz, K.Z. (1981) The Foundations of Ethology\n6.\nContrast \"action specific fatigue\" and \"habituation\".\n(Section 6)\n\nThis was demonstrated particularly clearly by Prechtl (1949)\nin studies of the releasing of the gaping movements of\nyoung chaffinches (p 119).\n\nIn each case, there is a decrease in the response with\nrepeated presentations of a stimulus.\n\nLorenz, K.Z. (1981) The Foundations of Ethology\n\nPrechtl showed that \"fatigue\" occurs not only on the \"motor\nside\" with performance of the FAP, but also on the receptor\nside.\n\nEach part of the stimulus configuration that can elicit\ngaping could be separately habituated. (Habituation occurs\ncloser to the input side.)\n\nLater in the book, beginning on p 265 when he is dealing with\nlearning, Lorenz reviews habituation.\n\n\"Action-specific fatigue\"\n- \"Fatigue\" is not the best term for what Lorenz is\ndiscussing. He means the decrease in motivational\nlevel (ASP) that occurs each time the FAP is\nperformed. It can appear to be \"fatigue.\"\n\nHabituation: examples\n- Selectivity of habituation demonstrated by Syrian\nhamster behavior\n- Orienting of head & eyes toward novel visual, auditory and\nwhisker stimili--when the movement does not lead to reward.\n- Escape into tunnel in response to novel sounds.\n- In each case, there is a progressive decrease in response\nintensity (or the probability of a response) with decreasing\nnovelty (with repeated presentations of the stimulus).\n- A stimulus that can trigger the FAP can become less and less\neffective with repetitions, while a separate key stimulus\nremains fully effective. There is habituation to that first\nstimulus; this habituation is lost over time.\n- The response is also strongly affected by the modality and the\nspecific situation.\n\nLorenz, K.Z. (1981) The Foundations of Ethology\n7.\nWhat are \"tool activities\" as defined by Lorenz.\nGive examples.\n\nHow is their underlying motivation - their ASP -\ndifferent?

Locomotion with searching, stalking, pouncing, killing bite.\n- How frequently does a cat perform each of these behaviors?\n- Cat must search much more than stalk, stalk more than pounce, etc.\n- The thresholds for stimuli to initiate searching (locomotion) are\nlowered the most quickly.\n- This can result in a quick lowering of thresholds for very\nfrequently performed actions (see next questions)\n\nLorenz, K.Z. (1981) The Foundations of Ethology\n8.\nGive examples of threshold lowering of releasing stimuli,\nand its cause. Include at least one example from human\nbehavior. (Section 7, p 123-125)\n\nHunger and feeding\n-\n\"When in need, the devil eats flies.\" (Goethe)\n\nBreeding and sexual attraction\n-\nMales become less and less selective as they are deprived of\nmating longer and longer. (In animal breeding, including cross-\nbreeding, males are brought to a receptive female.)\n-\nLorenz' example from human behavior\n\n9.\nClosely related is the phenomenon of vacuum activity, or\n\"in vacuo\" reactions. Define and give examples. (See\nsection 9, p 127-129)\n\nHis story about a sea captain's perception of women when he returned from a voyage.\n\n\"Vacuum activity\"\n- Lorenz' pet starling: catching and feeding on non-\nexistent insects.\n- Canary or rat: nest building with own feathers, or tail.\n- Mallard drakes attacking own tails\n- Ostrich plucking grass, even if non-existent\n- Rodent gnawing...\n\nEven very minimal stimuli become effective with\nvery strong drive. The internal reservoir appears\nto spill over. These are examples of extreme\nthreshold lowering.\n\nLorenz, K.Z. (1981) The Foundations of Ethology\n10. What phenomenon which is a major component of most\ninstinctive behavior (FAPs) was defined by Wallace Craig in\n1918? (Section 10) Define and give an example. P 129-130\n\n11. Describe examples of an \"appetite for aggression\" and the\nemotional reactions to this concept that people have shown.\n(Section 11, p 130-133)\n\nAppetitive behavior\n\nAn appetite for aggression?\n- Examples of an appetite for aggression\"\n- A young man \"looking for trouble\"\n- A graylag gander likewise may behave this way.\n- Experiments with marine Jewel Fish (see p 132):\n- A male in fighting mood will learn a simple maze where the reward\nis a visual encounter with a slightly smaller male. (The encounter is\nan aggressive one.)\n\nAn appetite for aggression?\n- Why some scientists, and other persons, have reacted\nstrongly against such an appetite, and against the\nspontaneity of aggressive behavior in general:\n\n- For a long time (especially in America and in Russia) there was a\nstrong bias against the idea that any behavior could not be explained in\nterms of a stimulus-response model.\n- As we have discussed previously, there was a bias against instinctive\nbehavior in general, especially with regard to humans (and especially in\nAmerica).\n\nLorenz, K.Z. (1981) The Foundations of Ethology\n12. Describe how the internal readiness, or ASP, varies\namong different FAPs. (Section 12, p 133-136)\n\nVariations in internal readiness (ASP)\namong different FAPs\n- It builds up at a rate proportional to how often the\naction is needed.\n- When it builds up faster, it appears less susceptible\nto fatigue, and the action is more likely to be\ndischarged in vacuo.\n- Examples:\n- Flying in various small birds vs flying in greylag geese\n(p 134): How fast does the ASP build up?\n- The various motor patterns involved in prey-catching by\ncat-like carnivores (p 134-135)\n- Paul Leyhausen's studies. What does a cat do in a room full of\nmice? (if the cat is a hunter)\n\nLorenz, K.Z. (1981) The Foundations of Ethology\n13. Is it true that cats and dogs hunt only in order to\neat? Describe evidence for your answer.\np 134-135\nDescribe a simple experiment.\nA cat motivated to hunt may be well fed already, and ignore its favorite food in\norder to be able to hunt mice or other small animals.\n\n14.

(1981) The Foundations of Ethology\n1.\n\"The innate releasing mechanism responds to\ncomplex stimulus configurations and triggers a\nbehavioral response from the organisms.\"\n\nCriticize this false statement, using one or two\nexamples.\n\nLorenz, K.Z. (1981) The Foundations of Ethology\n1.\n\"The innate releasing mechanism responds to complex\nstimulus configurations and triggers a behavioral response\nfrom the organisms.\"\n\nCriticize this statement, using one or two examples.\n\n-\nFirst, the stimulus configuration is usually simple.\n-\nSecond, \"triggers\" can be misleading, as it depends\non the level of the action specific potential (the\nlevel of motivation). (It is not a reflex.)\n\nExamples of the simplicity of key stimuli\n- Examples from Tinbergen's studies of gulls and\nstickleback fish (reviewed earlier)\n- Examples from Lorenz p 156:\n- The stinging response of the female common tick\n(example used by Jakob von Uexkull in 1909):\n- Body temperature of about 37 degrees (see next slide)\n- Smell of butyric acid\n- Common cricket female's response to courting\nmale:\n- She responds to specific pitch of male's courtship song.\n- Males of some mosquitoes:\n- Respond to the specific frequencies of the female's\nwingbeats\n\nThe stinging response of the female common tick:\n- The tick probably does not detect a surface temperature at a\ndistance. It may respond to the odor of an animal walking below\nit, but most likely it simply falls from a branch when the branch\nis moved by an animal.\n- Its stinging response, however, is triggered by the surface\ntemperature plus the odor.\nDeer ticks\nPhoto removed due to copyright restrictions.\nImage is in public domain.

Reference: Figure 1 from Baker, Myron C.\n\"Bird song research: the past 100 years.\" Bird Behavior 14, no. 1 (2001): 3-50.\n\nGiven the time constraints of this presentation, I'll focus on one type of vocal music\nbehavior in animals: the birdsong.\nWhy does the bird sing?\nWe can examine this question through Tinbergen's four questions on Causation,\nDevelopment, Evolution, and Functionality.\n1.\nCausation\n-\nIn other words, what is the proximate cause of birdsong.\n-\nBirds have a complex vocal organ, as well as neural circuits in their brains that\nare activated when their hormonal levels are high. These neural circuits\nsynapse onto the vocal muscles, causing a \"song\" to be produced.\n2.\nDevelopment\n-\nIn terms of how the birdsong develops in each bird, birds are raised in an\nenvironment full of songs particular to their conspecifics (that is, birds of the\nsame species as them)\n-\nThere are many studies that show that birdsong is, to a large extent, learned by\nyoung chicks at a young age, by mimicking their mothers or other conspecifics.\n-\nPractice and learning establishes the neural connections we discussed in\n\"Causation\".\n3.\nEvolution\n-\nSyrinx = in the chest, at base of trachea and between lungs. Devoted entirely to\nsound making. (Suthers 1999)\n\n-\nAll birds share a similarly shaped syrinx. Possessing a syrinx distinguishes them\nfrom other vertebrates (a feature that all birds have, and that only birds have)\n-\nindicates that this unique vocal organ evolved near the beginning of bird\nevolution.\nBut the question that has been subject to more debate, and the question we'll be delving\ninto today, is: What is the function of birdsong?\n\nA diagram of the bird syrinx. Located in between lungs. Syrinx is critical for song production,\nas McDonald 1989 demonstrate (this experiment will be explained later in the\npresentation).\nImage is in public domain.\n\n-\nWhat is the function of birdsong? In other words, what is the ultimate cause?\n-\nIn terms of what we know about evolution and Darwinian selection, birds most likely\nsing because their ancestors who sang out-reproduced those who didn't.\n-\nBut \"WHY\" did singers out-reproduce the non-singers is the big question.\n-\nUntil recently, it had been believed that sexual selection was the only reason for\nbirdsong (i.e. males sing to attract females).\n-\nHowever, more recent research has indicated that vocal music in birds may have more\nfar-reaching purposes, including strengthening pair bonds, cementing other social bonds\n(family, group bonds), and territorial defense.\n-\nLet's examine the evidence supporting each hypothesis, to determine which is most\ncompelling.\n-\nWhere does sexual selection fall, in comparison with other possible adaptive functions?\n\nSexual Selection as the function of birdsong\n-\nPast researchers, including Darwin, have claimed that vocal music behavior developed in\nanimals as an adaptive function for sexual selection (Darwin 1871)\n-\nEthological research has supported Darwin's hypothesis that most birdsong functions as\na courtship display to attract mates (Catchpole & Slater)\n-\n(this was a big step beyond previous unscientific, unfounded theories by natural\ntheologians such as William Paley, who claimed that birdsong had no function for the\nanimals themselves, but were only \"miracles\" bestowed to humans by some higher\ndivine force)\n-\nThe hypothesis that sexual selection is the main function of birdsong is supported by the\nfollowing points of evidence:\n-\nMale birds sing much more than females\n-\nSongs are sung mostly in breeding season\n-\nmale singing ability is a good predictor of their fitness\n-\nMales sometimes drop dead from exhaustion from singing too much during\nbreeding season - this male sacrifice suggests that the function of birdsong is\nnot to enhance survival but to increase their likelihood of leaving offspring\n\n-\nSome researchers took a broader approach, and asked whether general social\ncommunication and bonding may be the main function of birdsong.\n-\nBirdsong signals, sent between conspecifics, tend to fall within a small number of\ndistinct categories (Hauser 1996)\n-\nWarning calls exchanged between kin (to signal a dangerous predator)\n-\nContact calls between group members (so that the group stays together when\nflying)\n-\nDominance/submission signals between conspecifics\n-\nHow do these functions compare to sexual selection, the function we just discussed\nearlier?\n-\nBirdsong specific to courtship purposes is more prolonged in duration, more complex\nand varied in pitches, and more energetically expensive (expensive enough that males\ncan die of exhaustion).\n-\nSexual selection appears more significant, as a function for birdsong, than other broader\nsocial communication signals.\n\n-\nTwo pieces of supporting evidence\n-\n1.\n-\nRemove male from territory. If nothing is done, other males will rapidly invade\nthe now-empty territory. (Falls 1988)\n-\nHowever, if replace place a loudspeaker playing the male's song, his empty\nterritory will be invaded less rapidly by other males.\n-\n(However, this study is not completely compelling because its comparing silence\nwith song. It could very well may be that other males do not invade the\nloudspeaker-placed territory simply because it would be more difficult to invade\na space they think is occupied by another male)\n-\n2. More compelling study: \"selective muting experiment\" (McDonald 1989)\n-\nMake a tiny puncture in air sac surrounding syrinx of sparrows. Makes them\nunable to produce full song, but their ability to produce normal calls is intact.\n-\nThese males were slower at obtaining territories, and were less able to retain\ntheir territories.\n-\nThese disadvantages are reversed when the muted males regain their singing\nabilities.\n-\nConvincing evidence that one function of birdsong is territorial defense.\n-\nHow important is this function, compared to that of sexual selection?\nCourtesy of Eugene Archer on\nFlickr.

License\nCC\n\nBY-NC.\n.\n\n-\nNow that we've discussed the competing theories of what the function of birdsong is,\nit's worth stopping to think and put everything together.\n-\nWe started this discussion with the question of to what extent Sexual Selection was the\nprimary function of birdsong, in comparison to other potential functions (ultimate\ncauses)\n-\nWe looked at three possible functions: sexual selection (courtship), within-group\ncommunication, and territorial defense.\n-\nWe saw that there were various calls and songs that communicate set messages to kin\n(e.g. warning, staying together, hierarchy, passwords). However, evidence suggests that\nwithin-group communication may not the primary function of birdsong, given that\ncourtship songs are much more complex and costly.\n-\nWe also saw that territorial defense is one of the functions of birdsong. But is it the main\none? The evidence is convincing, however another way to look at it is: a male who is\ncapable of gaining and protecting is territory from other males is viewed as\n\"masculine/reliable\": an attractive trait to females. So in the end, territorial defense may\nfall under the umbrella of sexual selection as well.\n-\nThus, I'd like to come to the conclusion that sexual selection is indeed probably the\nprimary function of birdsong. There is undeniably other functions, but the importance of\ncourtship appears to override that of the others.\n\nFuture Directions\n-\nFurther studies may shed more light on the adaptive function of birdsong\n-\nStudying the role of birdsong in female birds (e.g. repeating Falls and McDonald's studies\nbut with females) may provide more insight into the role of birdsong in sexual selection.\n-\nIf female subjects yield same result as males did, sexual selection may not play\nas significant a role as previously believed.\n-\nStudying the correlation between a male's ability to defend his territory and how\nattractive he is to females (i.e. how many females he mates with, how many off spring\nhe leaves, his genetic fitness) may confirm our suspicion that territorial defense (as a\nfunction of birdsong) is in fact under the larger umbrella of sexual selection.\n-\nHow may this enlighten us on the nature of human music?\n-\nDarwin: human musical abilities are \"amongst the most mysterious with which\nhe is endowed\"\n-\nBecause music is a human universal that does not have an obvious, practical\nfunction.\n-\nThus, understanding the function of music in animals may lead to a clearer\nunderstanding of what function music may have in humans like ourselves\n-\nAnalogies between:\n-\nAnimal vocal music vs. Human music\n-\nAnimal vocal music vs. Human language\n-\nVocal learning is a prerequisite of both song and speech\n-\nStudying vocal learning in animals may shed light on both song and\n\nspeech in human behavior\n\n20% Relevance to class: Cite specific ideas or principles of ethology and sociobiology\n.\n.\n20% Sources: search effort, reading effort, adequacy for the report and accuracy of\nunderstanding\n.\n.\n20% Organization of ideas with helpful use of headings; clarity of descriptions\n.\n.\n20% Examples used to explain the topic clearly and effectively; interest shown by\nstudent and generated in audience\n.\n.\n20% Critique of studies read and future directions (your ideas about relevant work\nyou think should be done if you were working in this field).\n.\n.\nRecency of reports: there are a few in more recent years you should include.\nAlso, there are studies of non-bird vocalizations that are relevant, as in howler monkeys.\nI liked your report very much. Just remember, it is the males that sing in most species.\nIt would be interesting to study more the songs of dueting species (both sexes contribute\nto the song trains).\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n9.20 Animal Behaviour\nFall 2013\n\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

Because a subordinate is less likely to survive on their own,\nand also very unlikely to be high-ranking an another group\n\nThis structure benefits the species - better genes are passed on. However,\ndominance is never perfect, and other individuals want to pass on their genes too, so\nthat's why the disparity is created. Animals must find clever ways to mate while\navoiding the dominant male/female in controlling species.\nCourtesy of Ivan Teage on Flickr.

Because of this,\nmore resources can be dedicated to egg-laying. Less conflicts also means less stress\nand injuries, so the probability of healthy offspring is higher.\n\nThe alpha position is only good for short periods of time - eventually age, stress, and\nhigh energy expenditure catch up and a replacement is brought in.

      "content": "9.20\nMidterm review notes, questions, topics\n\nTOPICS FOR REVIEW\n\nClass 1: Introduction\n1. What is the \"blank slate\"? In what fields did this idea flourish?\n2. Contrast the attitudes about this idea in America and in Europe.\n3. What were the big new ideas of Charles Darwin, Charles Whitman, and Oskar\nHeinroth in the study of animal behavior?\n4. Describe the importance of animal behavior in the field of ecology.\n5. Who was Jim Corbett, and how did he contribute to knowledge of animal\nbehavior?\n6. Other names from various classes: Konrad Lorenz, Niko Tinbergen, John Garcia,\nJohn Dewey, Jerry Lettvin (at MIT). Paul Leyhausen, Edward O. Wilson: How\ndid each of these persons contribute to the field of animal behavior? Which one of\nthem was not a scientist?\n7. Contributions of amateur naturalists to studies of animal behavior: Whitman,\nHeinroth, Jim Corbett, Monty Roberts.\n8. Give an example of a topic likely to be found in a mammalogy book but not in a\ncomparative psychology or ethology book.\n\nClass 2-3: Introduction to ethology\n\n1. The science of animal behavior developed in different academic departments in\nEurope and America. What was the difference?\n2. What was the work of Eibl-Eibesfeldt in establishing \"human ethology\"? (two\nkinds of studies, and a major book)\n3. Tinbergen's 4 questions: Different answers to the question, \"Why does the animal\ndo this?\" Discussed in video on stickleback fish, in Scott book, and in class.\n4. Why does a male stickleback fish try to attract a female to his nest, and then later\ntry to prevent her from coming to his nest? What is his \"zig-zag dance\" and its\nfunction?\n5. How have \"dummy stimuli\" been used to study the sensory cues that attract a\nmale stickleback fish to a female for mating purposes?\n6. Describe experiments by Tinbergen and his students to obtain evidence for innate\ndifferences between newly hatched Kittiwake gulls and black-headed gulls. Why\nhave these two species evolved such differences in behavior? Also, describe a\ndifference in adult behavior in these species.\n7. How could an innate behavior pattern become maladaptive? Describe an example\nfrom animal behavior.\n8. Related question: Describe an example of a human \"vice\" that constitutes\nmaladaptive responses to \"key stimuli\" --i.e., instinctive behavior that, at least in\nthe modern world, is maladaptive.\n9. Why did removal of eggshells from their nest evolve in black-headed gulls,\naccording to experiments by Niko Tinbergen?\n10. Describe imprinting in geese (or in other species including Jackdaws--see next\nclasses)\n\nClass 3-4: Konrad Lore nz' jackdaws\n\n1. What are properties of jackdaws that made them so interesting for study by the\n22-year old Konrad Lorenz? (Three properties were mentioned in class.)\n2. What are adaptive functions of play? Which animals do it?\n3. \"Like the stones of a mosaic, the inherited and acquired elements of a young\nbird's behaviour are pieced together to produce a perfect pattern. But, in a bird\nthat has been reared by hand, the natural harmony of this design is necessarily\nsomewhat disturbed.\" Describe an example of this.\n4. Why should we expect care of young to be largely innate in animals? How could\nyou look for learned components of this behavior?\n5. How do jackdaws recognize predators? Distinguish innate and acquired\ncomponents.\n6. Describe two kinds of evidence for recognition of individuals by jackdaws.\n7. Describe a behavior pattern that indicates a pairing of jackdaws. How long before\nactual mating does this occur? How long do such pairs remain paired? What\nbehaviors occur frequently between members of a mature pair?\n\nKonrad Lorenz and his students: studies of geese (video & discussion)\n\n1. Imprinting: Describe its unique properties. Give an example of how it can lead to\ndisturbances in \"the natural harmony\" of nature when an animal is reared by a\nhuman.\n- Student -\"The goose doesn't develop it's natural behaviors?\"\n- Imprinting: it is unique in that there is a sensitive or critical period in which it occurs,\nand it is irreversible after it happens. The goose does develop its natural behaviors but\nit may respond to abnormal stimuli, e.g., it may try to mate with humans.\n2. Mobbing--describe for two species, and indicate its functions.\n- We saw mobbing responses in geese and in meerkats, in response to predators. It\ncommunicates to the predator that it has been detected and that they can most likely\nget away from him. It also communicates that he is outnumbered and may get injured.\n3. How do young geese learn their social rank, according to experiments by\nLorenz and his students at Seewiesen, Germany?\n- Geese learn social rank from observing how their mother interacts with other geese.\nThey learn her rank and assume a similar rank.\n4. How is a young goose that is imprinted on a human \"parent\" taught to fly by the\nhuman? Compare with learning to walk.\n\n- How is a young goose that is imprinted on a human \"parent\" taught to fly by the\nhuman? Compare with learning to walk.\n\nClass 5-6: Ethology and the CNS\n\n1. A recent analysis (published in 2011) of studies of whether geese have innate\nanti-predator responses to hawks reached conclusions that differed from those of\nearlier claims. What was the main conclusion?\n2. FAPs in humans? Give examples. How do we know they are largely innate?\n3. FAP vs reflex: How do they differ? [see also class 8]\n\n4. What are sign stimuli, or key stimuli, in animal behavior? Are they complex or\nsimple? (See also class 9.)\n5. What are \"supernormal stimuli\"? Examples in studies of birds. Examples of how\nsuch stimuli are used to influence human behavior.\n6. Neuron types: primary sensory, secondary sensory, and motor neurons. Where do\ninterneurons fit in?\n7. Neuroethology of vision: role of midbrain tectum (discussed for frog and toad,\nand for hamster)\n8. See class 9 for the contribution of Lettvin at MIT. He studied \"IRMs\" in frogs.\nSummarize a major finding of his work on frogs.\n9. How the Brazilian wandering spider catches prey in the air without using vision:\nthe key stimulus.\n10. Contrast \"command neuron\" and \"motor neuron\"?\n11. Advantage of giant axons in squid or crayfish?\n12. What is an \"ethogram\"? [Class notes, beginning of class 6; discussed more\nextensively in class 12]\n\n- A recent analysis (published in 2011) of studies of whether geese have innate anti-\npredator responses to hawks reached conclusions that differed from those of earlier\nclaims. What was the main conclusion?\n- Neuroethology of vision: role of midbrain tectum (discussed for frog and toad, and\nfor hamster)\n- Jerry Lettvin's contribution at MIT to the study of IRMs\n- Contrast \"command neuron\" and \"motor neuron\"?\n\nClass 6-7: Motivational states\n\n1. Homeostatic mechanisms, including behavior: specific examples\n2. Temperature regulations: contrast the roles of behavior in a reptile and in a\nmammal.\n3. Appetitive and consummatory behavior (distinct components of any FAP):\ncontrast them with examples from animal behavior.\n4. Two major types of thirst, with different sensory inputs that cause the thirst\n5. The hormone leptin: What is it? Can it explain hunger?\n6. Short-term vs long-term regulators of feeding behavior: specific examples.\nExperiments that demonstrated the role of certain short-term regulators, including\nstimuli from the mouth and throat.\n7. \"Hedonic...regulation can override the homeostatic pathway during periods of\nrelative energy abundance....\" What is meant by \"hedonic regulation\"? It can\nlead to specific addictions, including food addictions.\n8. Types of motivational control of behaviors: cyclic and episodic types. Give\nexamples of each.\n9. Endogenous and exogenous controllers of activity rhythm (the \"circadian\nrhythm\"). Discovery of a specific biological clock that regulates activity cycles.\n\n10. Definitions of \"free running\" rhythm; \"entrainment\" of a rhythm.\n11. Why do animals sleep? Answers can be of different types: the adaptive functions\nthat caused it to evolve; a behavioral instinct (FAP) with specific key stimuli;\nbrain mechanisms.\n12. Ultradian rhythms.\n13. Describe adaptive functions of sleep, each of which may have influenced its\nevolution.\n14. Biphasic sleep; multiphasic sleep. Describe a specific example.\n\n- Short-term vs long-term regulators of feeding behavior: specific examples.\nExperiments that demonstrated the role of certain short-term regulators including\nstimuli from the mouth and throat.\n- Endogenous and exogenous controllers of activity rhythm (the \"circadian rhythm\")\n\nClass 8: Lorenz' Fundament al s of Ethology\n\n1. Three distinct processes involved in a Fixed Action Pattern: Note the difference\nbetween the concepts of a fixed action pattern and a fixed motor pattern. What are\nthe other components of the FAP?\n2. Intention movements: What are they? In the evolution of behavior, some\nintention movements have become \"ritualized\" to serve as social signals. Major\nexample: ritualized aggression/fighting among conspecifics. Why is such\nritualized behavior so important, more for some species than for others?\n3. A fixed action pattern can involve a series of actions. How can we know that it is\na single FAP and not several? (We discussed Lorenz on the \"unity of\nmotivation.\") What are two of the arguments? (Class 8 slide 8)\n4. Define an \"IRM\" and the role of key stimuli. Seitz produced evidence from\nstudies of fish that the effects of key stimuli are additive (his law of heterogenous\nsummation).\n5. Threshold lowering: Describe specific examples.\n6. What is \"in vacuo\" behavior?\n7. What are three multipurpose actions (tool activities) that are used in a great many\nfixed action patterns? (See also class 12.)\n8. What is an Action Specific Potential (ASP), and how, without external\nstimulation, does the speed of its build-up vary among different FAPs? (Recall\nthe study of cats by Paul Leyhausen.)\n9. Seitz' law of heterogenous summation: What, specifically, is summated?\n10. Define \"action-specific fatigue.\" Is it really fatigue?\n11. In contrast to action-specific \"fatigue,\" How can one demonstrate that habituation\nof an innate response depends on central changes that are not on the motor side of\nthe pathway of information flow?\n12. List responses, overt and not-so-overt, to novel stimuli. Separate behavioral\nresponses and responses resulting from autonomic nervous system activity. (See\nalso chapter 12.)\n13. Hunting and feeding: Describe evidence that they are distinct FAPs using specific\nexamples.\n\n- What is \"in vacuo\" behavior?\n- Define \"action-specific fatigue.\" Is it really fatigue?\n\nClass 9: Innate releasing mechanisms; other topics from Lorenz\n\n1. Jerry Lettvin's contribution at MIT to the study of IRMs\n2. The simplicity of key stimuli can be indicated by maladaptive responses (in\nanimals or in humans). Describe examples. See also class 13.\n3. What is the \"dummy rule\"?\n4. But why do some FAPs require complex stimuli to elicit them?\n5. How does the European cuckoo or the Whydah bird (both \"social parasites\")\nexploit properties of IRMs of other species?\n6. Studies of interactions between Great Spotted Cuckoo birds and Magpies in Spain\nhas yielded evidence for what has been called the \"Mafia hypothesis.\" Briefly,\nwhat is this hypothesis? (It concerns attempts of magpies to resist the brood\nparasitism by the cuckoos, and the cuckoos' responses.)\n7. Releaser: definition and examples. (It is not an IRM, but an IRM responds to it. It\nhas evolved to provide key stimuli for eliciting a fixed action pattern.)\n8. Releasers and key stimuli that affect human behavior; how they are exploited for\ncommercial purposes.\n9. Automimicry in evolution: meaning and examples\n\n- What are sign stimuli, or key stimuli, in animal behavior? Are they complex or\nsimple? (See also class 9.)\n- Define an \"IRM\" and the role of key stimuli. Seitz produced evidence from studies\nof fish that the effects of key stimuli are additive (his law of heterogenous\nsummation).\n- Why do some FAPs require complex stimuli to elicit them?\n\nClass 10-11: More from Konrad Lorenz\n\n1. The Tinbergen and the Lorenz models of FAP organization: What are key\ndifferences? What are the major strengths of each model?\n2. Give examples of the \"inertia of excitation\" in human and animal behavior.\n3. In what ways can innate behaviors (instincts), called fixed action patterns, be\nflexible? (Recall the parental behavior of the female digger wasp, studied by\nTinbergen. Also, remember the learning by cats to link various FAPs for hunting\nbehavior.)\n4. Closely related: Examples of how certain behavior patterns that serve as\nappetitive behavior in feeding may have ASPs independent of the FAP they\nnormally serve (e.g., in feeding by ducks, cactus finches, in hunting by cats or\ndogs). I.e., they are independent FAPs, but in normal experience they usually\nbecome linked (via learning).\n\n5. What does Lorenz claim to be the main reason a head had to evolve in evolution?\nExplain an additional reason.\n6. How, in general, has the function of the \"head ganglion\" changed in higher\nvertebrates, with respect to FAPs? (p 209)\n7. How can reflexes conceal the rigidity of fixed motor patterns?\n8. Ability to solve a detour problem: Why it is not always a good test of\nintelligence?\n9. Describe how facial expressions of threat by dogs appear to have evolved from\nsuperpositions.\n10. Multiple simultaneous motivations: consequences if very strong. Describe 3 ways\nof dealing with the conflict that have been studied in animal behavior. Give\nexamples of each way.\n11. Insight in apes: What is it, and what is the evidence?\n12. How can one distinguish between higher and lower animals using behavioral\nabilities?\n\nAbility to solve a detour problem: why it is not always a good test of intelligence\n- Animals differ in their reflexes and FAPs. Some can solve the problem using\ninnate responses alone.\nWhat does Lorenz claim to be the main reason a head had to evolve in evolution?\n- In class you learned of additional reasons.\nHow can one distinguish between higher and lower animals using behavioral abilities?\nWhat does Lorenz claim to be the main reason a head had to evolve in evolution.\n- In class you learned of additional reasons.\nIn Lorenz' view, why did the head, containing the \"locus of superior command\", have to\nbe invented in evolution? (p 206-207)\n- To limit behavior to one motor pattern at a time.\n- Setting priorities among motivational states\n- To embody the IRMs for selection of a motor pattern (FAP). [Most stimuli\ncome into the brain through the cranial nerves.]\n- System-wide modulation, \"states\"\nHow, in general, has the function of the \"head ganglion\" changed in higher vertebrates,\nwith respect to FAPs? (p 209)\n- Increased linkage between innate and learned aspects of behavior.\n- Initiation of behavior patterns driven by learned motivations and cognitive\ndecisions.\n- Cognitive level: at the top of the neural hierarchy but not always dominant\n- More centralized planning; stronger executive functions\nHow can one distinguish between higher and lower animals using behavioral abilities?\n- Examples from chimp and gorilla problem solving\no Evidence for the formation of plans within an internal model, within\nwhich places and events can be anticipated and alternatives can be\nconsidered.\n- \"Higher\" may be answered in terms of anticipation abilities: A unique role of\nthe neocortex.\no Special role of the prefrontal association areas of the neocortex in\nplanning\n\n- What animal has, in relative terms, the largest prefrontal cortex?\no A brain system superimposed on others: the grammatical language\nsystem (dependent on both frontal and posterior multimodal\nassociation areas of the neocortex)\no Superimposed on, and highly interconnected with, systems\nembodying both spatial and object memories.\no The associations allow symbolic representations and reasoning\no Weakly developed, if developed at all, in most animal species\n\nClass 12-13: Evolution; development and plasticity of behavior\n\n1. Three basic multipurpose behaviors (tool movements) of almost all animals. In\nvertebrates, outputs of the midbrain control each of these behaviors. (Also\nmentioned in class 8)\n2. The \"mantle of reflexes\" for the background support of behavior, enables stability\nof the internal mileau and stability in space\n3. The regulators, or controllers, of behavior are the \"drives\", associated with FAPs\nand learned habits. In vertebrates, midbrain mechanisms are involved, but the\nforebrain mechanisms have become more dominant.\n4. Write a partial outline of the regulators of behavior--basic drives (associated with\nFAPs)--i.e., start an outline of an ethogram.\n5. What are some drives, with their own ASPs, related to ingestion behaviors but\nnevertheless distinct from hunger and thirst?\n6. Responses to novel stimuli have been discussed. There is a motivation to seek\nnovelty (the curiosity drive), most pronounce in advanced, large-brained\nvertebrates. See also above, chapter 8.\n7. Lie detection uses the same measures used to measure aspects of the orienting\nresponse (to novel stimulation). What is the similarity between reactions to\nnovelty and reactions to a lie?\n8. Describe the roles of genes and environment in the behavior of hygienic bees.\n9. If you are asked, about any specific behavior, \"Is it due to nature or nurture ?\"--\ni.e., genes or environment--what is nearly always the correct answer?\n10. Why have investigators investigated learning in sea slugs or snails or insects?\n11. Imitation and mimicry: Give examples from animal behavior studies\n12. Directional cues in animal navigation or migration; examples from Tinbergen and\nfrom Scott. (Landmark orientation in female sand wasp. Homing pigeons. Long-\ndistance bird migrations.)\n13.

How can a desert ant find its way back to\na nest without visual landmarks?\n15. \"Compass\" and \"map\" senses: How are they different? Cues used for each by\nhoming pigeons? Birds flying very long distances: cues used at night?\n\n16. Evidence for innateness of migration in animals\n17. What cues does a rat or mouse use to solve the Morris water maze? Describe an\nexperiment that can give evidence for this.\n18. How are marsh tits and blue tits (small birds) different in their navigational\nabilities? Why do marsh tits have a larger hippocampus?\n19. What are the major benefits and costs of very long-distance migrations in various\nspecies?\n\n\"Compass\" and \"map\" senses: How are they different?\n-\nBoth concern sense of direction\n-\nBut a compass sense means direction with respect to earth's axis\n-\nMap sense: directions with respect to environmental landmarks, usually sensed\nby means of the visual system\nCues used by homing pigeons?\nBirds flying very long distances: cues used at night?\n\nClass 14-15: Communication\n\n1. Example of visual communication in animals and in humans; Panamanian golden\nfrogs; blue tits during agonistic encounters (Graham Scott's studies); wild horses\n(Monty Roberts).\n2. Sensory exploitation in evolution of courtship signals (water mites, water strider,\nswordtail fish), and in the evolution of flowering plants\n3. Sexual selection: examples, e.g., those seen in videoclips shown in class. What limits\nit? Examples in the video: the male superb lyre bird of Australia (the incredible\nimitator); the male palm cockatoo of Australia (drumming with a tool as well as\nsinging); male jumping spider's (\"singing\"); Reifel bird (courtship call, dance and\nvisual display).\n4. Ritualized fighting: why did it evolve? Species differences, as in birds? (See also\nclass 8.)\n5. Auditory communication in whales and dolphins: advantages?\n6. Multiple functions of bird song: four listed in class\n7. Electrical signals for communication and for localization: Mormorid and Gymnotid\nfish. How is this related to the evolution of the taste system in catfish?\n8. Why was olfactory communication, most likely, so important in the early evolution of\nmammals?\n9. What was the basic finding in the study of lorikeets concerning ritualized fighting vs\nactual, overt fighting? (study by James Serpell, described by Scott)\n10. Alarm calls in animals: examples from bird behavior and from mammalian behavior.\nSome of them convey specific information about the type of predator. Give examples.\n11. Why might a bird emit a fake alarm call, i.e., a deceptive call?\n12. Discoveries about the behavior of wild mustangs by Monty Roberts, who is not a\nscientist but an accomplished horse trainer: see the questions based on the online\nvideo.\n\nElectrical signals for communication and for localization:\nMormorids and Gymnotids (fish). How is this related to the evolution of the taste\nsystem in catfish?\n-\nElectroreception and the elaborate system of taste receptors both are useful\nWhy was olfactory communication, most likely, so important in the early evolution of\nmammals?\nHow can it be used for functions other than communication?\n\n-\nEarliest mammals had reduced vision and enlarged olfactory and auditory\nsystems, as they were night-active, living on the forest floor and avoiding the\ndominant predators, various reptiles including the dinosaurs.\n-\nOlfaction is used for identification and memory for both objects and places\n\nVideo on Meerkats of the Kalahari Desert\n1. What inter-species interactions were indicated, not specifically involving\npredation by the meerkats?\n2. Give examples of communications among the meerkats.\n3. Describe two examples of \"altruistic\" helping behaviors.\n4. What is the major FAP used in foraging by meerkats?\n5. What is the major adaptation of this species to predators?\n\nWhat inter-species interactions were indicated, not specifically involving predation\nby the meerkats?\nGive examples of communications among the meerkats.\n-\nAuditory\n-\nVisual\n-\nOlfactory--not depicted\n-\nTactile\nDescribe two examples of \"altruistic\" helping behaviors.\nWhat is the major FAP used in foraging by meerkats?\nWhat is the major adaptation of this species to predators?\n\nClass 16: Foraging\n\n1. Conditioned taste aversion (the poisoned bait effect): What is it? How is it\ndifferent from classical conditioning? How was this kind of learning described by\nLorenz?\n2. Information transfer about food sources by animals living in colonies: ospreys vs\nblack-headed gulls.\n3. Role of neophobia in feeding, and how it can change.\n4. Group vs solitary foraging or hunting: advantages and costs.\n5. Optimizing foraging: gains and costs; examples from Scott. What is being\noptimized?\n\n6. Why do marine iguanas fall into two different groups according to their foraging\nstrategies?\n7. Why do crabs select intermediate sized mussels rather than larger mussels in their\nfeeding behavior?\n8. Ideal free distribution in group foraging of birds--example of redshanks. The\nmodel explains why foraging redshanks (or other species) visit less productive\npatches of food although most of their time is spent at the most productive patch\nin the area. Explain why such behavior has evolved.\n9. Population control: What happens to rats subjected to extreme crowding?\n10. Alarm calls: not only altruistic but also selfish (see next class)\n\nClass 17: Antipredator behavior\n\n1. Primary and secondary defense strategies\n2.

Two types of mimicry.\n5. How group foraging can help\n6. How mobbing can help\n7. Adaptive function of stotting in Thompson's gazelles? What explains why\ngazelles that show stotting are caught the least by big cats?\n8. How alarm calls can help: But why would an animal (e.g., a bird) give a warning\ncall that betrays its location to predators? How can you explain this? Are such\nbirds caught more often than birds that do not give warning calls?\n9. Why do ground-nesting birds make nests on relatively open ground?\n10. The plovers' defense strategies: examples\n11. Lizards' special defense strategy\n12. Hamster strategies for avoiding predation\n13. Tonic immobility in chicks and in opossum (also in hamsters and rabbits)\n14. \"Great Escapes\": What did the rabbit do to escape the clutches of the bobcat?\nWhat is a likely reason that the bobcat did not succeed in killing the prairie\nchicken?\n15. The innate escape response of a kangaroo rat to an attacking rattlesnake\n16. Are the instincts of antipredatory behavior really \"fixed action patterns\" as\ndefined by Konrad Lorenz? Or would you call them reflexes? Or behaviors with\nproperties of both reflexes and FAPs?\n\nAdaptive function of stotting in Thompson's gazelles?\nWhat explains why gazelles\nthat show stotting are caught the least by big cats?\n-\nGazelles that stot are usually far enough from the cat to escape an attack by running,\nand are the ones that show the most stotting.\nHow alarm calls can help: But why would an animal (e.g., a bird) give a warning call\nthat betrays its location to predators? Are such birds caught more often than birds\nthat do not give warning calls? How can you explain this?\n-\nThese birds are caught less often than non-callers. Those that are caught are also the\n\nslowest to initiate flight from the predator.\n\nVideo: \"Great Escapes\"\nWhat did the rabbit do to escape the clutches of the bobcat? What is a likely reason that\nthe bobcat did not succeed in killing the prairie chicken?\n-\nRecall the discussions of Lorenz, in particular his review of Paul Leyhausen's\nstudies of cats\n\nWhat were the strategies used by the rabbit in escaping from the bobcat in a\nsnow-covered forest area?\n-\nThe rabbit escaped the bobcat by running very fast, with sudden changes in\ndirection which caused the bobcat to lose traction in the snow and hence its speed.\nAlso, when the cat landed on top of him, the rabbit burrowed under the snow to get\naway.\nWhy was the prairie chicken not killed when caught by a bobcat?\n-\nThe prairie chicken was not killed because the level of motivation (drive\nlevel, ASP quantity) was not high enough for the final step in the series of\nfixed motor patterns--the killing bite. Apparently the cat had attacked and\nkilled other prey fairly recently. Lack of hunger was probably not the major\nreason.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n9.20 Animal Behavior\nFall 2013\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

What is the adaptive function of play? Which animals do it?\n\n2. What property of jackdaws made them such interesting pets for the young Konrad\nLorenz, beginning in 1925 when he was 22 years old? What other species that people\nkeep as pets are similar in this regard?\n\n3. \"Like the stones of a mosaic, the inherited and acquired elements of a young bird's\nbehaviour are pieced together to produce a perfect pattern. But, in a bird that has been\nreared by hand, the natural harmony of this design is necessarily somewhat disturbed.\"\nDescribe examples of this (two or three).\n\n4. Why should we expect care of young (brood tending) to be largely innate in many\nanimal species? How could you look for learned components of this behavior?\n\n5. How do young jackdaws come to recognize predators? Distinguish innate and\nacquired (learned) components.\n\n6. Describe evidence for individual recognition among jackdaws of a colony (flock).\nHow do we know that they can recognize individual humans?\n\n7. The male jackdaw lacks colorful plumage for displaying towards a female. When a\nyoung male jackdaw falls in love, how does he try to get the attention of his favorite\nfemale and win a positive response? (p 155f)\n\n8. How does the female jackdaw respond in the way that signals an engagement? This\nhappens 12 months before sexual maturity and actual mating. (p 157)\n\n9. Describe two behaviors that occur frequently between a betrothed or \"married\" pair of\njackdaws. How long do such pairings last? (p 159)\n\n10. Most conflicts among jackdaws are settled by posturing - postures that display\naggressive or defensive intent. Defense of a nest site is done this way with the\naccompaniment of loud calling (\"zick, zick\") that becomes, in Altenberg, Germany,\nmost intense and nearly continuous in a colony in February and March. What ensues if\na defending jackdaw is actually attacked? (p 166-168)\n\n11. Describe how an older jackdaw can entice a young one to return home.

Describe the chain of behavior patterns shown by newborn kittens in nursing\nbehavior. Note how an innate motor pattern acts as appetitive behavior for another\ninnate motor pattern, in a \"functionally consistent chain.\" (p 192)\n\n6. Such chains of behavior are very common, and were described by Tinbergen as\nexamples of a \"hierarchical organization of instinct.\" Such a hierarchy can be\ndepicted diagrammatically as in figures 19a and 19b (often reproduced in textbooks).\nNote how Tinbergen's diagrams show a view of IRMs and FAPs that differ from the\nLorenz model. What is the major difference?\n\n7. What is the major point made by Lorenz in his description of Baerends' (1956)\nanalysis of the parental behavior of the female digger wasp? (pp 198-202)\n\n8. What is the \"upending\" behavior of ducks and geese? In what abnormal\ncircumstance would such birds be \"feeding for the sake of upending instead of\nupending for the sake of feeding - as is usually done\"? Such an example shows how\nmotivation at one level in a hierarchy may be stronger than that from a higher level,\nand thus indicating some independence. (p 202)\n\n9. In Lorenz' view, why did the head, containing the \"locus of superior command,\"\nhave to be invented in evolution?

Study questions, pp 235-241: Taxis and reflexes; spatial orientation and thinking\nin higher animals\n\n10. Explain how the \"mantle of reflexes\" (term from von Holst) tends to conceal the\nrigidity of fixed motor patterns. (pp 235-236)\n\n11. How does a goldfish solve the problem of reaching a bit of food it can see behind an\nimpenetrable obstacle? (p 237) It can do this without the need for learning.\n\n12. How do human languages give clues to the nature of \"insight\"?\n\n13. Describe evidence for thinking in apes, from studies of \"insight\" learning.\n\n14. Note Lorenz' hypothesis of a higher control center in \"higher\" animals,\n\"superimposed on all these orienting mechanisms\" and remembering changes in the\nenvironment and judging \"the priority of incoming insight information\" (p 241).\nHow can we distinguish higher and lower animals?\n\nPart D. Study questions, pp 242-253: Multiple motivations: compromises; ritualization.\n\n15. Briefly list the various ways animals deal with the simultaneous activation of two (or\nmore) motivational states. How is the conflict resolved, or not resolved?\n\n16. Give an example of how superposition of approach and avoidance FAPs occur in\ngeese or in fish. (p 243-244)\n\n17. Describe evidence that gestures of threat have originated from superpositions. (p\n244)\n\n18. Mutual inhibition usually occurs between action patterns at the same level of\norganization (p 247), so that only one will be expressed at any one time. However,\none action pattern may be given absolute priority. Explain.\n19. Mutual inhibition an also cause oscillations between two FAPs. Give an example of\nhow such oscillations can become \"ritualized\" in evolution, so they become social\nsignals.\n\n20. Define \"displacement activity.\" In what two situations do displacement activities\noccur?

With reference to Q16 and Q17, for what abilities is the hippocampal formation in\nthe brain most needed? (Read the boxes on p 86 and p 87.)\n\nE. Migration, pp 86-91.\n\n19. Describe benefits and costs of long-distance migrations.\n\n20. How do you think evidence has been obtained that the stars are used to guide long-\ndistance migrations of birds? Describe a practical method.\n\n21. What cues besides the stars are used by such birds?\n\n22. How do we know that migration behavior is innate?\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n9.20 Animal Behavior\nFall 2013\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

      "content": "9.20\nClasses #14-15: Communication\n\nStudy questions: Scott ch 5\n\nA. Introduction, pp 93-96\n\n1. Discuss with examples: adaptive and maladaptive effects of signals intended for\ncommunication.\n\nB. Evolution and design of signals, pp 96-109\n\n2. Most species of frog and toad communicate by auditory signals. However, one\nspecies of frog in Panama does not. How does the Panamanian golden frog\ncommunicate with its own kind, and why did this method evolve?\n3. Explain why the courtship display of the male water mite Neumania pupillator\nprobably evolved. It involves his creating vibrations that resemble those of a prey\nanimal.\n\n4. Why do female swordtail fish prefer males with a long tail extension? (See box on pp\n99-100.) Try to give at least one example of the same kind of phenomenon in human\nbehavior. (There are many.)\n\n5. Why have a great many species evolved ritualized fighting behavior? The author,\nGraham Scott, has studied this in the birds called blue tits.\n\n6. What are the distinct advantages of auditory communication in the case of whales,\nsong birds, and marmoset monkeys? For each species, explain at least one advantage\nover visual communication.\n\n7. What are two distinct functions of birdsong?\n\n8. In what situation does communication by electrical signals have a clear advantage? It\nis used by African mormyrid fishes and South American gymnotid fishes.\n\n9. Describe advantages and disadvantages of olfactory communication. Olfaction\nappears to have been of major importance in early mammalian evolution, and remains\nso for many mammals.\n\nC. Alarm calls, pp 109-115.\n\n10. What are two functions of alarm calls: one obvious, and the other not so obvious?\n\n11. Why do some foraging birds sometimes emit a fake alarm call?\n\n12. Explain how ground squirrels and vervet monkeys convey specific information about\npredators to other members of their species (conspecifics).\n\nD. Individual recognition, pp 115-117\n\n13. Describe at least two functions of individual recognition.\n\n14. In what species other than humans may \"names\" for individuals be used?\n\nStudy questions: Monty Roberts on his observations of wild mustangs, and on his\nprocedure he calls \"join up\"\n\n15. Describe the leader of the group of mustangs observed by the thirteen-year-old Monty\nRoberts in Nevada.\n\n16. What does it mean to call the horse an \"into pressure\" animal? Give examples.\n\n17. At what time of the day/night were the observations of wild horses by Monty Roberts\nmost successful?\n\n18. What is the nature of the language called \"Equus\" by Roberts? What was the incident\nthat first led him to begin to learn this language?\n\n19. What is \"join up\" as the term is used by Roberts?\n\nBrief outline with things to watch for in \"Meerkats of the Kalahari\" video:\n\nThe meerkat is a social mammal, a small mongoose, living in the Kalahari Desert in\nsouthern Africa. The video shows some of this species' adaptations to life in this hot and\narid habitat. It also shows\n-\nsome interesting inter-species interactions not involving predation,\n-\ncompetition between groups of meerkats,\n-\ncommunications within a group (auditory, tactile, and likely visual as well)\n-\nvarious altruistic helping behaviors, and\n-\nexamples of teaching and learning behavior. Note the clearly suggested FAPs,\ninvolving:\n-\nforaging and feeding, and\n-\navoidance and escape from aerial and ground predators, with some evident\nroles of communication and of learning.\n\nQuestions:\n\n1. What inter-species interactions were indicated, not specifically involving predation?\n\n2. Give at least two examples of communication among the meerkats.\n\n3. Describe two examples of \"altruistic\" helping behaviors. For one of these, what\nevidence would support the conclusion that this behavior is a fixed action pattern?\n\n4. Describe at least two behaviors that appear to be FAPs used in foraging by meerkats.\n\n5. What is the major adaptation of this species to predators?\n\n6. There are some inaccuracies in the portrayal of meerkat behavior in the video and the\nnarration by George Page. Describe one, using reports in the literature (use Google\nScholar).\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n9.20 Animal Behavior\nFall 2013\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."
