  "syllabus_content": "Course Meeting Times\n\nLectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session\n\nRecitations (discussion sections): 1 session / week, 1 hour / session\n\nCourse Overview\n\nThis subject provides an outline of the history of architecture and urbanism, from the first societies to the present. Students analyze buildings and the built environment as the products of culture and in relation to the special problems of architectural design and the history of architecture, with an urbanist perspective that stresses the cultural and political context from which building arises. The course develops critical tools for the analysis and appreciation of architecture, for its role in the intellectual environment in which we conduct our lives. Instruction and practice in oral and written communication are provided.\n\nThis particular instance of the course is titled\nA Global History of Architecture\n. It considers both western and eastern traditions, and spans from the prehistoric to the sixteenth century.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nThere are no prerequisites for this course.\n\nTextbook\n\nChing, Francis, Mark Jarzombek, and Vikram Prakash.\nA Global History of Architecture\n. 2nd ed. John Wiley & Sons, 2010. ISBN: 9780470402573.\n\nGoogle Earth\n\nGoogle Earth\nis an important resource for this course, and will be used during lectures. The textbook comes with many Google Earth .kmz files, and some assignments will also require its use.\n\nRequirements and Policies\n\nRequirements include attendance at lectures and sections, a midterm exam, a final exam, and 3 papers.\n\nReadings are to be completed before lecture. A short quiz is given at the start of most lecture sessions on the prior lecture and associated reading. These quizzes are not officially graded, but the answers are reviewed in class as part of the discussion.\n\nThe teaching assistants for your section and the instructor are available to discuss the material of the class. You can rewrite your papers to improve your grade, in accordance with a schedule that you must work out with the TA. Unexcused lateness in handing in assignments will affect your grade. If you cannot make a class, you should email your TA in advance so as to not damage your attendance record. More than 3 unexplained absences will result in an automatic letter grade reduction.\n\nGrading\n\nACTIVITIES\n\nPERCENTAGES\n\nTwo exams\n\n50%\n\nThree papers\n\n40%\n\nSection participation\n\n10%\n\nCalendar\n\nSession Key\n\nL=Lecture\n\nR=Recitation (discussion section)\n\nSES #\n\nTOPICS\n\nKEY DATES\n\nL1\n\nFirst societies\n\nL2\n\nThe Gravettians and the hunting tradition of the north\n\nPaper 1 assigned\n\nL3\n\nThe Holocene and the agro-pastoral emergence\n\nR1\n\nDiscussion: first societies\n\nL4\n\nGrains, animals and the village world\n\nL5\n\nCities, gods and empires\n\nR2\n\nDiscussion: The MIT Chapel\n\nL6\n\nPits and granaries: the sacred section\n\nL7\n\n1500 BCE: After the Cataclysm: Knossos and Karnak\n\nR3\n\nDiscussion: buildings and representations in time\n\nL8\n\n800 BCE: Iron and the New World Order: Greeks, Etruscans, Assyrians\n\nPaper 1 due\n\nPaper 2 assigned\n\nL9\n\n500 BCE: Persia and Central Asia\n\nR4\n\nDiscussion: the pyramids\n\nL10\n\nFire, water and chariots\n\nL11\n\nBuddhism: Out of India\n\nR5\n\nDiscussion: architecture history textbooks\n\nL12\n\nChang'an\n\nL13\n\nRome\n\nR6\n\nDiscussion: Timgad and Roman urbanism\n\nL14\n\nRome (continued)\n\nMidterm review\n\nMidterm exam\n\nL15\n\nThe Americas\n\nL16\n\nEarly Christian transitions\n\nPaper 2 due\n\nPaper 3 assigned\n\nR7\n\nDiscussion: ritual plans\n\nL17\n\nEarly Islam: 800 CE\n\nL18\n\nFrom Armenia to Borobudur\n\nL19\n\nEarly Hindu architecture\n\nR8\n\nDiscussion: the profession of the architect in classical antiquity\n\nL20\n\nSoutheast Asia and Angkor Wat\n\nL21\n\nGothic architecture: Cistercians & cathedrals\n\nR9\n\nDiscussion: the plan of St. Gall\n\nL22\n\nLate medieval Europe: Renaissance in perspective\n\nL23\n\nHistory and time\n\nUNESCO & cultural nationalism\n\nPaper 3 due\n\nL24\n\nColonial worlds\n\nL25\n\nReview session\n\nFinal Exam",

The Batammaliba, for example,\nwho reside in Togo east of the town of Kante are thought to have migrated into\nthe area in the seventeenth and eighteenth century. But whether their\narchitecture was brought with them or developed in contact with other peoples\nis not clear. Their architecture revolves around the direct relationship between\ngrain, family structure and the universe.\nFor the Batammaliba, architecture is deeply rooted in the concept of the\nuniverse and in their understanding of what it means to be a human. The house\nin fact is treated like the anatomy of the human in that it has eyes and doors and\nfront and a back. Houses are also aligned to the sunset of the winter solstice.\n\nWhen the sun entering the house through the west-facing door symbolizes the\nreturn of Kuiye, who is considered the sun deity and who is also understood as\nthe first architect who built the earth and constructed the first domicile here for\nhimself and his first sons. He is both male and female. Kuiye's village is placed in\nthe western sky as well as the village of the dead. Each house in the village of the\nliving is a replica of that house. In addition to the door alignment a hole is put in\nthe roof of the second floor which allows Kuiye to enter the bedroom when the\nsun transits the zenith directly over head. Kuiye is also understood as the first\narchitect who built the earth and constructed the first domicile here for\nhim/herself and his/her first sons.\nThe hole is known as tabote hole under which take place funeral rites and\nbirth. The tabote is sealed with a flat circular stone (kubotan) which symbolizes\nthe continuum of life, death and rebirth, the power of the gods Kuiye and Butan,\nand the life force of the house. Butan is the complementary power of Kuiye. She\nprovides coolness and moisture and has both a corporal and a spiritual essence.\nShe has an important role in house nourishing, protection, fertility, human\npregnancy and delivery. She is also closely identified with the circle derived\nfrom the shape of the earth.\nThe corners of the facade are marked by two elevated, straw-covered\ngranaries, each supported by a tall, earthen support tower. The main interior\nchamber, \"the cattle room\", is a dark, low-ceiling room that serves as a sleeping\nplace for elder men and as a chapel and barn. The house altar is positioned at the\nback of this room along the wall that joins the two granaries. This place is\ndefined as \"the place of the dead.\" The roof is supported by a forked post and\nbeam framework covered with wooden crosspieces and earth, forming a roof\nterrace. The remaining rooms are used for storage and for housing the domestic\nanimals. The central sleeping room for women and children is located on the\nupper level. The kitchen is placed to its left. The roof level positioned above the\ncattle room incorporates at its center the tabote hole. Besides the hole is a dry-\nseason fireplace. Here the family usually eats dinner. The rest of the house\nterrace is employed for work and recreation. Smaller terrace roofs above the\nkitchen and other rooms are used for drying crops and for sleeping during the\nhot months of late winter. During cold nights, a fire is lighted in the downstairs\ncattle room with the tabote hole serving as a chimney.\nDaily life in the house reinforces the overlapping symbolisms. The\nbedroom is the womb that provides the house with children. After birth the child\nis brought to this secure space and will spend most of its first two years there.\nWhenever a person visits a friend, he or she must greet that person's house by\noffering a salutation to the mouth of the house. The house's two drainage pipes\nare conceived as penis and anus and direct potentially dangerous rain water\noutside during a rainstorm and during daily terrace baths.\nJust as the interior is identified with the inner self and the ancestors, the\nfront of the house represents the projection of the person in the community with\n\nthe.i There, near the door, one finds an earthen altar called lisenpo mound\ndedicated to Kuiye, Butan, and the village ancestors, and it is said to contain the\nessence of Batammaliba knowledge, history, economy, religion, and life,\nembodies food, divinities (Butan), future children and women necessary for life\nto continue. Near the door there is an open-sided, flat-roofed shelter, used for\ninformal meetings and for daytime naps as well as drying sorghum. The north-\nsouth gender division within each house is reinforced by gender-related\nactivities, rituals, and the placement of the deities' shrines. The second house\ndivision is the use of upstairs, female space and downstairs, male space. Finally\nthe house is divided into the front and outside, men part and into the back and\ninterior, women part. What becomes clear is that, in this spatial inversion, the\nhouse is defined primarily as a residence of the gods and deceased elders. Only\nsecondarily is the house identified with humans.\nThe village is perceived as an oval, though it is designed as such and seen\nto represent a person through the distribution of shrines to Butan. The village\nlandscape is ordered by paths which represent the pathways of the gods. The\ncemetery is modeled on the settlement and the tomb locations correspond to\nthose of the house in the village.ii The tombs are similar to the house, but are\ncarved into the earth as opposed to being built on top of it. Like the house it is a\nraised and plastered terrace with a circular roof defined by an overturned jar.\nThey also have a west-facing portal and an interior sleeping chamber.\nEach house is constructed by a master architect called otammali which\nmanes \"one who creates or builds well with earth.\" An otammali undergoes a\nlengthy apprenticeship. And only someone who has overseen the construction of\nmore ten structures oversees the design of the ground plan of every new\nstructure in the community. These masters, can even demand that part of a\nstructure be rebuilt. House construction is generally undertaken between the\ndry-season months of December and February with an architect usually\nundertaking one house per season. Apprentices and even the house owner might\nhelp, but the architect is responsible for the layout and all its associated ritual\nsignificances. The house is only ready for occupation once the doorstep has been\nritually installed.\n\ni Suzanne Preston Blier, \" Moral Architecture: Beauty and Ethics in Batammaliba\nBuilding Design,\" Dwellings Settlements and Traditions, Cross-Cultural Perspectives\n335-355\nii 20-21 Michael Parker Pearson, Colin Richards, \"Ordering the World, Perception\nof Architecture, Space and Time,\" Architecture and Order: Approaches to Social\nSpace, Edited by Michael Parker Pearson, Colin Richards, (New York: Routledge,\n1994)\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n4.605 Introduction to the History and Theory of Architecture\nSpring 2012\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

The ancient history of the Kalahari peoples is, however, rela\ntively obscure since little is known about them archaeologically, but from linguistic and other\nevidences, it is generally assumed that their ancestors had spread out over south African territory\nperhaps having moved southward from east Africa. Digging implements that date to about\n15,000 BP prove that al least by that date they had begun to add edible tubers into their diet and\nin doing so fashioned an approach to subsistence that was extraordinarily resilient in the dry cli\nmate.\nFor those !Kung who have held out, it is not surprising that their culture has not changed over\nthousands of years as it is perfectly tuned to arid conditions. The women have detailed knowl\nedge of the desert environment and they use special sticks to unearth the bulbs and tubers that\nserve as a source of both food and water. One food needs no implements at all. It is the nut of the\nMongongo tree. This tree exists in large linear groves several hundred meters wide and several\nkilometers long, that stretch intermittently virtually coast to coast between the latitudes 15-21\ndegrees. The trees produce a huge amount of nuts. In a good year, they can be knee deep. The\nnuts are an excellent nutritional source, and can be eaten raw, but are even more delicious when\nroasted. They store well, and remain edible for much of the year.\n\n4.605 Global History of Architecture - MIT Spring 2012 - Prof. Mark Jarzombek\nTAs: Mohamad A. Chakaki, Igor Demchenko, Michael Kubo\nThe !Kung are not want of meat. In fact, they are perfectly positioned in the overlap of areas\nwhere the kudu, wildebeest, giraffe and antelope migrate. Since these herds need water just as\nmuch as humans their movements are predictable. There are, after all, just so many water holes\nand springs. The bows and arrows of the hunters may not be big, but the poisoned tips are lethal.\nOnce dazed by the poison, the animals are swiftly dispatched with spears and axes. The meat,\nincluding liver and heart, is roasted immediately with parts of the animal brought back to the\ncamp including the head, which is cooked communally.\nAborigines of Australia\nAt the time of the landing of the Europeans, it is thought that there were some 300,000 people on\nthe continent, but there were probably more. Though there are numerous different tribes and\ngroupings, the basic family unit is always a man, his wife or wives, and their children. Strong\nbonds also exist, however, between its members and members of the local group. Though much\nof life is spent in the context of family units, occasionally people gather in larger groups of doz\nens or perhaps even hundreds of people for special purposes. Hunting and gathering techniques\nvary depending on the local ecology. In the arid interior of the continent, hunters use little in the\nway of equipment so as not to be burdened in their search. Near the sea and along the big inland\nrivers where it is possible to lead a much more settled existence, people use nets, fishing lines\nand canoes. Food ranges from bird eggs, small mammals, lizards, edible grubs, palm nuts, honey,\nand, when possible, fish. The hunt has important cultural significance for the men, but women\nare often the chief food-suppliers.\nThough often described as nomads, in actuality, Australian people move between a number of\ncontiguous ecological systems to exploit seasonal foods and resources; furthermore, the geo\ngraphical range of the various groups is in most areas are restricted by territorial rules. People are\nconscious of their place within their local territory, intimate with its geography and spiritually\nattached to its sacred sites and histories. People often prefer to live and sleep in the open when\npossible, but are very adept in making shelters and in places where there are abundant food re\nsources. There is a strong tendency toward permanent settlements. This has led to a great deal of\ndifferentiation. The native Australians speak over two hundred different languages and hundreds\nof associated dialects.\nThe !Kung and Aborigines, contrasted\nDifferences between Aborigines and the !Kung are profound. For the !Kung, a hut was a rela\ntively generic device, whereas for the Aborigines, the windbreaker, as informal as it might seem,\ndefined a piece of social geography designed around the specific set of people it protects. It\ncould be bigger or smaller. Furthermore, the central fire which played such an important sym\nbolic role for the !Kung, is not as prominent for the Australians. A fire was set up in front of the\n\n4.605 Global History of Architecture - MIT Spring 2012 - Prof. Mark Jarzombek\nTAs: Mohamad A. Chakaki, Igor Demchenko, Michael Kubo\nwindbreaker, but there was no common fire at the conceptual center of the group. Separate shel\nters are commonly used for diurnal and nocturnal activities. During the day, men and women\ncongregate apart, while the families resided together at night protected by huts or windbreakers.\nDuring the dry season, people sleep on the ground in a row between small fires. The windbreak\ners, and when needed their associated huts, are designed close enough for visual and aural com\nmunication, but far enough to allow for the personal and social activities around each area.\nCamps are often sited near a source of water and firewood. A site is also chosen on a clear area\nwhere there is good visibility to guard against intruders. Warm and sandy ground is preferred.\nThere are also different types of camps, serving various economic, social or ceremonial func\ntions.\nAdditional Bibliography\nPaul Memmott, Gunyah, Goondie and Wurley: The Aboriginal Architecture of Australia\n(Queensland, University of Queensland Press, 2007) pp. 22-41, 58-63, 112-118.\nChristopher Ehret, The Civilizations of Africa, (Charlottesville, The University of Virginia Press,\n2002) pp. 26-58.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n4.605 Introduction to the History and Theory of Architecture\nSpring 2012\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

The designs for both buildings we to be distinctive as landmarks\ntestifying to MIT's commitment to arts and humanities and were to figure prominently into a\nmuch more extensive campus plan to the west of Massachusetts Ave. including graduate student\nhousing, more dormitory space and a student center. Separated from the classrooms to the east of\nMass Ave., the chapel and the auditorium were to become the centerpieces of the non-academic\nprecinct of the MIT campus and marked the first stages of a new building effort to contribute to\nthe character of MIT as well as to provide for the increasingly diverse curricula or the Institute.\nConstruction of the MIT Chapel began in May 1954, initial occupation in May 1955.\nArchitect:\nEaro Saarinen shared the same birthday as his father, Eliel Saarinen. Saarinen emigrated to the\nUnited States 01 America In 1923 at the age of thirteen. He grew up in Bloomfield Hills,\nMichigan, where his father was a teacher at the Cranbrook Academy of Art where he took\ncourses in sculpture and furniture design. He had a close relationship with fellow students\nCharles and Ray Eames and became good friends with Florence Knoll (nee Schust).\nBeginning in September 1929, he studied sculpture at the Academie de la Grande Chaumiere in\nParis, France. He then went on to study at the Yale School of Architecture, completing his studies\nin 1934. Subsequently, he toured Europe and North Africa for a year and returned for a year to\nhis native Finland, after which he returned to Cranbrook to work for his father and teach at the\nacademy. He became a naturalized citizen of the U.S. in 1940. Saarinen was recruited by his\nfriend, who was also an architect, to join the military service in the Office of Strategic Services\n(OSS). Saarinen was assigned to draw illustrations for bomb disassembly manuals and to provide\ndesigns for the Situation Room in the White House. Saarinen worked full time for the OSS until\n1944. After his father's death in t950, Saarinen founded his own architect's office. \"Eero Saarinen\nand Associates\".\nSculptor:\nThe chapel's curving spire and bell tower was designed by the sculptor Theodore Roszak and\nwas added in 1956.\nTheodore Roszak (May 1, 1907 - September 3, 1981) was an American sculptor and painter. He\nwas born in Posen. Prussia (German Empire), now Poznan, Poland, as a son of Polish parents,\nand emigrated to the United States at the age of two. From 1925 to 1926 he studied at the School\nof the Art Institute of Chicago, in 1930 he won the Logan Medal of the Arts, then moved to New\nYork City to take classes at the National Academy of Design with George Luks and at Columbia\nUniversity, where he studied logic and philosophy before going back to Chicago to teach at the\nArt Institute. He taught at Sarah Lawrence College throughout the 1940s and 1950s. He was a\nparticipating artist at the documenta II in Kassel in 1959 and at the Venice Biennale in 1960.\n\n4.605 Global History of Architecture - MIT Spring 2012 - Prof. Mark Jarzombek\nTAs: Mohamad A. Chakaki, Igor Demchenko, Michael Kubo\nRoszak's sculpture at first closer to Constructivism and displaying an Industrial aesthetic,\nchanged around 1946 to a more expressionistic style. Roszak was also an accomplished\nviolinist, and liked to use musical references in his artworks.

Chakaki, Igor Demchenko, Michael Kubo\nSection 9\nThe Medieval Monastery: The Plan of St. Gall\nTopics\n--the liturgical and social organization of a medieval monastic community, as expressed in plan\n--the graphic representation of three-dimensional forms; the logic of signification\n--how a plan may be interpreted as a construction document coding information, an expression\nof values and beliefs, or as an intellectual tool for study and reflection upon higher purposes\nBackground\nThe plan of St. Gall is drawn in red ink on a 30.5 inch x 44 inch sheet of vellum sewn together\nfrom five separate pieces. Latin inscriptions in dark brown ink identify the buildings. A dedica-\ntory legend is located to the east, i.e. the top margin above the cemetery/orchard. It reads:\nFor thee, my sweetest son Gozbertus, have I drawn this brief annotated copy of the layout\nof the monastic buildings with which you may exercise your ingenuity and recognize my\ndevotion, whereby I trust you do not find me slow to satisfy your wishes. do not imagine\nthat I have undertaken this task supposing you to stand in need of our instruction but rather\nbelieve that out of love of God and in the friendly zeal of brotherhood I have depicted this\nfor you alone to scrutinize. Farewell in Christ, always mindful of us. Amen.\nThe plan of St. Gall is referred to as a copy, exempla ta, suggesting that it is a tracing of an original\nprototype. The circumstances under which the original was produced are unknown. The copy,\ni.e. the plan of St. Gall, was made in the monastery of Reichenau, possibly by Haito, Bishop of\nBasel and Abbot of Reichenau. It was presented to Gozbert, Abbot of St. Gall (816-836) who\nplanned to rebuild the entire monastery; only the church was actually constructed (830-836). The\nprototype probably dates from 817. The St. Gall plan was copied c. 820.\nThe plan was not made for a specific site. It is an ideal plan incorporating the monastic reforms\npromulgated at the synods he ld at Louis the Pious' palace in Aachen in 816 and 817. Those re-\nforms acknowledged in the plan of St. Gall are the inclusion of houses for workmen within the\nmonastic enclave (they previously lived extramurally); the provision of a special dormitory on\nthe side of the church for visiting monks; and the transfer of the school for laymen and secular\npriests from the cloister which is preserved unique for the monks.\nThe plan of St. Gall was a statement of policy drawn up on the highest levels of political\nand ecclesiastical administration and conceived within the framework of a monastic reform\nmovement whose overriding preoccupati on was to establish unity (unitas) where life had\nbeen controlled by disparate traditions (diversitas), to put a single rule (una regula, una\nconsuetudo) in the place of the mixed tradition (regula mixta).

Chakaki, Igor Demchenko, Michael Kubo\nAt the end of the 12th century, the blank back side of the plan was used for the inscription of the\nLife of St. Martin. having exhausted this space, the scribe erased the building in the northwest\ncorner of the plan in order to complete his text. This building probably was intended to house the\nvassals and knights in the emperor's retinue. The hagiographical text obscured the importance of\nthe plan until the 17th century when Henricus Canisius (1604) and Jean Mabiollon (1704) pub-\nlished the explanatory captions.\nTerms\nclaustrum: the main cloister in the monastery.

This plain\nvaried in width from a few hundred meters in the south to 22km wide in Middle Egypt. Life\ndepended on the annual Nile flood, which takes place from mid-August to early October. This\nmeant one crop a year in autumn, after the flood, that was harvested in the spring. The irrigation\nsystem was based on lateral earth banks or dykes between levees to create agricultural basins,\nwith canals conducting the water from the river as the flood peaked (see figure below). The\nsystem of basins was interconnected so excess water was drained with 'siphon canals' into lower\nbasins and eventually returned to the Nile after the flood had subsided. Each basin was\nsufficiently moistened by the flood that no further irrigation was necessary. Crops were harvested\nin the spring, leaving a long summer period when only kitchen gardens and livestock needed\ntending. The labor of the Egyptian population was thus available for other purposes.\nIt has been estimated that already by the third millennium BCE, the Nile Valley produced three times\nits own domestic requirements. From very early on, plenty of labor was available, because people\nwere not tied to constant year-round labor to draw water off of the river. Soon, huge workforces of\nslaves, laborers, technicians, bureaucrats, and cooks were employed solely for royal projects. And\nthere was no shortage of building material. Stone was abundant all up and down the Nile: red granite\nfrom Aswan, white marble from Gebel Rokham, black basalt from Faiyum, plus the various types of\nsoft sandstone brought downriver from Nubia.\nTerritory: In the Egyptian Old Kingdom a larger, consolidated region was governed by a single\nruler through a multi-leveled hierarchy of administrative centers. Within the territory there was\nlittle conflict between different cities. A diagram of this regional system would show a larger\ntotal area under control of a single ruler, but the cities were themselves less populous than in\nMesopotamia, consisting solely of the ruling elite, their retainers, and elite craft workers. With\nlittle conflict within the territory, the majority of the population could live in smaller village\nnetworks adjacent to their fields. More differentiation between rural agriculture and urban ruling\nelites and a larger total population led to larger surpluses that allowed the creation of art and\narchitecture of a more massive scale, luxury goods, and symbols of authority. Hence, the\nmonumental scale of architectural projects like the Giza pyramids during the Old Kingdom (see\nfigure below).\n\n4.605 Global History of Architecture · MIT Spring 2012 · Professor Mark Jarzombek\nTeaching Assistants: Mohamad A. Chakaki, Igor Demchenko, Michael Kubo\nArchitecture and Food: For Egyptian society (and not unlike those of Mesopotamia), food was not\nonly the sustenance of humans but also of the gods. In the Old Kingdom, offerings of food were laid\nout on an \"offering table\" in front of the Ka statue in the mortuary temple at the base of the pyramid, in\norder to provide for the difficult journey that lay ahead. Offerings consisted of meat, roasted fowl,\nbread, fruit, vegetables, beer, and wine, all delivered out of the temple's own agricultural estates.\nWhereas the Mesopotamians rarely sacrificed animals, which were not plentiful in the alluvial plain,\nfor the Egyptians animal sacrifices were not uncommon, with offerings--especially of gazelles,\nantelopes, geese, ducks, and pigeons--coming mainly from hunting. The Egyptians did not perform\nthe actual killing and bloodletting in \"sight\" of the gods; the Ka was visualized as alive and sensitive,\nor at least as coaxed back to life by tasty morsels.\nImages removed due to copyright restrictions.\n1) Fig. 14.2 in Trigger, B.
