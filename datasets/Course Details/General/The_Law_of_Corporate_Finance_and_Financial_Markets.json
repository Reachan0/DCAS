  "syllabus_content": "Course Meeting Times\n\nLectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session\n\nTopics\n\n15.617 is an introduction to business law which covers the fundamentals, including contracts, liability, regulation, employment, and corporations, with an in-depth treatment of the law of finance, including law-sensitive aspects of M&A transactions, national and international financial and securities markets, venture capital and private equity, the financial structure of the corporation and other business entities, antitrust, bankruptcy and reorganization, the regulation of financial service providers, and the regulatory and liability risks associated with innovative financial products and services.\n\nSome Advice from John Akula on Picking a Law Course\n\nI offer the following three law courses at Sloan:\n\n15.615/15.647\n, Law for the Entrepreneur and Manager (fall and spring) (615 is the full-semester course; 647 is the first half)\n\n15.616, Innovative Businesses and Breakthrough Technologies - The Legal Issues (fall only)\n\n15.617, The Law of Corporate Finance and Financial Markets (spring only)\n\nBased on my experience as a practicing lawyer, I recommend that students at Sloan take a law course. Managers face many law-sensitive issues that are crucial to the welfare of their companies and their own careers. These issues often arise suddenly and outside the normal course of business. Each of my courses is designed to give you the understanding you will need to exercise good judgement and leadership in those situations. Each course will also provide you with the foundation in law that you will need to make effective use of legal advisors, and to develop later in your careers a more sophisticated understanding of any legal issues that are central to your particular responsibilities.\n\nHowever, I do not expect students to take more than one law course. Thus my courses are designed as an array of choices, not a sequence, and there is substantial overlap with respect to legal fundamentals. You should pick the one that interests you most.\n\nRequirements\n\nClass Attendance\n\nStudents should attend class, since material is covered that is not in the readings. Attendance is taken. Absences for good cause (such as job hunting or family obligations) are excused. You should e-mail the TA before or shortly after the class in question, with a \"cc\" to the instructor, to request an excused absence. You do not need to include any personal details with the request.\n\nClass Participation and \"On-deck\" Preparation\n\nAll students are expected to participate in class discussion. In addition, for each class, some students will be assigned in advance to be \"on-deck.\" \"On-deck\" students should make certain that they prepare with special care and are ready to respond to questions about the readings. Guest lecturers are invited to call on the on-deck students. Each student will be \"on-deck\" approximately three times.\n\nTake-home Exercises\n\nThere are two take-home exercises. Students have three hours for an exercise, and some choice as to the particular three-hour period. The exercises have been scheduled to be available during the periods shown on the\nassignments\npage. For each exercise, each student will make arrangements with the TA to receive the exam by e-mail at a mutually determined time during the availability period, and will e-mail back the completed exam within three hours of receiving it. The second exercise will cover only material not covered by the first.\n\nDuring the period the exercises are available, students may not consult any other person about the content of the course.\n\nThe exercises heavily emphasize the required readings. The questions and format will be similar to previous years (although the exercises from some past years were of different lengths.) Past exercises and a sample answer will be made available to students.\n\nIt is not expected that students will need the full three hours to complete the exercise. I use this format so that a student does not have to write fast to do well. This may be of special importance to students for whom English is a second language.\n\nStudents Who Take More Than One of My Courses\n\nIf you take more than one of my courses, an additional research paper will be required in the second course, on a topic to be determined in discussions with the instructor.\n\nGrading\n\nGrading is not tied to a formula, but will be based approximately as shown below:\n\nACTIVITIES\n\nPERCENTAGES\n\nFirst Take-home Exercise\n\n30%\n\nSecond Take-home Exercise\n\n40%\n\nClass Attendance/Participation\n\n30%\n\nTextbook and Course Readers\n\nStudents should purchase: Bagley, Constance E., and Craig E. Dauchy.\nThe Entrepreneur's Guide to Business Law\n. 2nd ed. South-Western College Publishing, 2002. ISBN: 0324042914. We will read most of this book. There will also be a course-reader available at the MIT copy center later in the semester.\n\nChanges from Last Year\n\nThis is the first year this course is offered. It is replacing a half semester course (\n15.649\n) given in past years on the law of M&A.",

Schedule and timing. Make arrangements with the TA to have the exam e-mailed to you at a\nmutually convenient time, and then within three hours e-mail back to the TA the completed\nexam. Keep a hard and computer-readable copy of your exam.\n2. Sources and communication among students: During the period the exercise is available,\nstudents may not consult with each other about the course. For the exercise, you may consult the\ntext, the readings, and any notes prepared by you, but no other sources. (Since your answers will\nbe evaluated in terms of the course readings and the lectures, especially the readings, consulting\nother sources would not likely do much good.)\n3. Weighting and strategy: There are two questions. Answer both. They will be weighted\nequally. Each particular point you should address appears in a sentence ending with a \"?\" Don't\nneglect to respond to each \"?\"\n4. Format and submission of answers: Your answer should have a cover sheet which includes\nyour name, \"ESL\" if English is your second language, and the exact word count for the entire\ndocument. Start the answer to each question on a fresh sheet. Your entire submission should\nnot exceed 1,000 words.\n5. Some general advice (READ THIS CAREFULLY): You are not supposed to be a lawyer, and\nI don't expect you to have definite answers to legal questions. You are supposed to be a manager\nwith the ability to make a preliminary assessment of legal problems. Each question will ask you\nto address legal issues in a business context from the point of view of a manager. It doesn't\nmatter much if I don't agree with your judgment as to how serious a risk or problem is, so long\nas you spot it and understand the legal and managerial implications of it. Your answers should\ndemonstrate your understanding of and ability to express broad legal concepts, and your ability\nto spot where and how the law will have an impact on a business problem and the individuals\ninvolved. It will not be necessary to cite specific cases or statutes. Make sure that your answer\nfocuses on how general legal principles apply to the facts you have been given. To the extent\nthat the facts are not as specific as you would like them to be for your assessment, point that out.\nYou shouldn't concern yourself with implausible possibilities. I don't try to \"trick\" people in\nthese exams. Look for the main issues suggested by the facts, and get right to them. Be\nresponsive in your answer; that is, answer the specific questions that have been asked from\nthe perspective you have been asked to assume. (For example, if you are asked to provide\nsome alternative courses of action, do so. If you are asked to assess risk from the perspective of a\nparticular party, do that.) Your answers should be well-organized and clearly written. The length\nlimit is tight, so you will probably have to edit your answers carefully to cover the necessary\npoints in the limited space allowed.\n6. Grading: If your exam is over the length limit, or submitted late, there will be a downward\nadjustment to your grade.\n7. Originality: Your answer must be in your own words, unless you use quotations and give a\nsource. Do not copy (or copy with only a change in a word or two) material from the readings\ninto your answer.\nNOTE TO ESL STUDENTS: If English is your second language, and you are having\ntrouble understanding the wording of a question, you can try to call me or the TA for help.\n\nQuestion #1.\nYou are Smarty Aleck, and you graduated from Sloan 12 years ago. You are now a senior\nmanager at BigCo, a publicly-traded corporation that manufactures medical devices, and that has\nexpanded its business lines significantly in recent years but has never acquired another company.\nThe CEO at BigCo is Ms. Top Dog, an engineer by training and very strong on the product\ndesign side of the business but weaker on finance. One of the reasons Top hired you is your\nexpertise in acquisitions.\nTop is thinking seriously about acquiring LittleCo, a privately held medical devices firm. She is\nsomewhat unsure that she fully understands how the deal might be structured, and she wishes to\nbegin clarifying her thinking on this issue without spreading word internally at this time. She\ntherefore has called a meeting with you to discuss the matter in confidence before deciding to\nengage other parties.\nTop believes that approximately two-thirds of LittleCo's product line presents \"numerous\nsynergies\", yet she is open to buying the entire business. Since BigCo very recently spent a\nsignificant amount of cash on a major expansion, Top would prefer to purchase LittleCo solely\nfor stock. In considering this potential acquisition, however, Top has become concerned that\nBigCo remain as insulated as possible from liabilities arising from LittleCo's existing medical\ndevice products. She also wants LittleCo's rights under its existing contracts to carry over to\nBigCo. Finally, Top desires that any proposed acquisition of LittleCo close quickly with as little\nback-and-forth over the purchase price as possible.\nGiven Top's above objectives, what are the non-tax tradeoffs that you would advise her to\nconsider when deciding between an asset purchase, a stock purchase, and a merger transaction?\n\nQuestion #2.\nYou are still Smarty Aleck, working for BigCo. It is one month since BigCo acquired LittleCo.\nAfter the acquisition, a decision was made to completely integrate the production facilities and\npersonnel acquired from LittleCo into BigCo, and you are in charge of that process.\nYesterday Ned Nervous, who is in charge of quality control systems for BigCo and is assisting in\nthe integration, came into your office. Ned said he had some bad news. Last week, Ned was\nreviewing some of LittleCo's internal quality control reports from the few months prior to the\nacquisition, and discovered a troubling pattern. The FDA requires that quality control problems\nbe reported to the FDA. Failure to make a required report is always treated as a serious matter\nand sometimes as a criminal matter if the lapse is significant enough. However, the regulations\nare not clear on how significant a problem must be to trigger the requirement of a report.\nNed believes that LittleCo., on at least three occasions during the few months prior to the\nacquisition, did not report certain quality control problems to the FDA of a kind which it had\nbeen reporting earlier and which BigCo would report. However, Ned is not sure that this was a\nviolation of FDA standards, since the standards are not clear. Ned also does not know if the\nunreported quality control problems had any impact on the quality of LittleCo's products. He\nsays he thinks such an impact would be unlikely because there was probably no impact at all on\nproduction and, in any event, other quality screens would probably have pulled out any defective\nitems, but he can't be sure. Although you generally have confidence in Ned, you are worried that\nsince he was heavily involved in the evaluation of LittleCo's quality controls during the due\ndiligence process, he may be inclined to minimize this latest problem.\nIf there were any defects in the products produced by LittleCo, the products liability exposure to\nBigCo would be substantial. Moreover, the question of whether a defect exists and how it\noriginated is not always clear in the kind of litigation which LittleCo's products have generated\nin the past, so even a showing of a lapse in quality controls without any clear evidence of a\ncausal link to a clearly defective product could hurt BigCo in litigation. Any quality control-\nrelated reports to the FDA become a matter of public record and will give the lawyers for any\nplaintiffs a road-map to the problem Ned has uncovered.\nRight after speaking with Ned, you called Top on the phone and will be meeting with her later\ntoday. Top made clear that the integration of the LittleCo assets into BigCo is too far along to\nreverse, so that process will continue to go forward, and she is prepared to assume for the\nmoment that BigCo cannot insulate itself from any products liability that may arise. She also\nmade clear that she is putting you in charge of coming up with a plan to deal with the problem\nwhich Ned uncovered. Given her initial comments, you know you are going to have to address\nthree points at the meeting, and you are preparing your thoughts:\nWhat should BigCo do to manage and minimize the risk of liability to consumers who might\nallege that they were harmed by any lapses in quality control?\nWhat should BigCo do with respect to the potential concerns of the FDA about possible lapses in\nreporting?\nWhat other steps should BigCo take to manage this problem?"

Dick is a computer scientist. Jane is a radiologist (a\nphysician who reads X-rays and other diagnostic scans). A few years ago, Dick and Jane\n(\"D&J\") formed a corporation called ScanTech, and since then have been working on the\nproblem of developing a computer-driven system for comparing diagnostic scans. Such a system\nwould be an important advance, but the development presents many problems.\nD&J have solved some key development problems, but other problems remain. Solving the\nremaining problems will be expensive. Having invested all of their personal savings into\nScanTech, D&J are seeking to raise working capital from investors. In exchange for your\nfrequent business advisory services, D&J have provided you with a 10% stake in ScanTech and\nnow wish to receive your advice on the following three concerns.\nA.\nD&J are considering venture capital financing. However, they are not willing to commit\nto a timetable for the completion of product development. (D&J believe they probably will\ncomplete the project within 5 years, but they wish to take even 15 years if necessary.) D&J have\nheard that a venture capitalist (VC) usually pushes a portfolio company for significant financial\nreturns over a short time period. They have asked you what general legal provisions a VC would\ntypically use to establish a time period for return on investment, and how effective these\nprovisions are likely to be. What would be your response? Given D&J's approach to timing,\ndo you believe they are likely to find a VC investor, and why or why not?\nB.\nD&J are also considering contracting with a \"strategic investor\". They have had some\npreliminary conversations with Blondie, a large Swedish corporation that manufactures medical\ndevices for sale throughout Europe. Blondie may be willing to invest substantial funds in a joint\nresearch and development effort, so long as Blondie is granted full intellectual property rights in\nEurope for the work which D&J have already done and for any further advances that grow out of\nthe joint venture. D&J are willing to permit this, but they want assurances that Blondie will not\nbe able to take over the U.S. market. What is your assessment of the risks under the U.S.\nantitrust laws of attempting to protect ScanTech from penetration of the U.S. market by\nBlondie, and why?\nC.\nIf they proceed with a joint venture with Blondie, D&J want the main activities to take\nplace in the U.S. Blondie will accept this if the joint venture is established as a separate entity.\nThe parties have begun referring to this proposed separate entity as \"JVE\" (joint venture entity).\nD&J have expressed three concerns about the structure of JVE. First, they are worried that the\ncollaboration might fail or that Blondie may figure out a way to stop funding, in either case\nleaving JVE with substantial liabilities. D&J want to protect ScanTech as much as possible from\nliabilities that might attach to JVE. Second, if JVE is doing well, D&J think it is likely that JVE\nwill take on an increasingly broad operational role and might eventually in effect \"take over\"\nmost of what ScanTech does as the primary base for all U.S. activities. Third, everyone\nanticipates that JVE will suffer substantial losses throughout its early years, and D&J would like\nto have the immediate tax benefits of those losses. In light of these concerns, what form of\nlegal entity would you suggest for JVE? If all of these concerns cannot be realized by a\nsingle kind of entity, what are the main tradeoffs among the possible alternatives?\n\nQuestion 2\nYou are the CEO of HotCo, a privately-held company. HotCo was organized five years ago to\ncommercialize a new approach to manufacturing the WhatIsIt, a component in electronic\ndevices. It is now clear that, using HotCo's technology, the WhatIsIt can be produced for $5.\nHotCo's most efficient competitor can only make a WhatIsIt for $6.\nInvestor interest is high because of this price advantage, and HotCo is planning its initial public\noffering. The effective date of the public offering is three weeks away, and right now you are on\nthe \"road show\" with the underwriters.\nHowever, you just received a phone call from Back Slapper, your Vice President for Human\nResources, with some troubling news about Whiz Kid, HotCo's head of research. Whiz's\nsecretary is Tess Truthful. Back Slapper has just told you that earlier today Tess came into his\noffice and told Back Slapper the following story.\nAccording to Tess, ten days ago Whiz drafted a progress report on his research. He writes such\nreports from time to time, whenever he thinks it is appropriate. Tess typed and edited Whiz's\ndraft. The report stated that the research team is now almost certain that, with some small\nchanges in the manufacturing approach, HotCo could produce the WhatIsIt for only $3.\nHowever, right after Tess finished typing the report, Whiz called her into his office. He first\nconfirmed that Tess had not discussed the report with anyone else. Then he asked for \"all\ncopies.\" He told Tess to delete the report from her computer hard drive, and \"forget everything\nabout that report.\" A few days later, Tess told Whiz that she felt uncomfortable, because she\ndidn't like to lie to co-workers and she would probably be getting questions about when the next\nprogress report would be coming out. Whiz told her that if she was smart, she would \"do what I\nam going to do and my brothers are going to do\" and buy up as much stock in HotCo as soon as\nshe could right after the public offering, because a few weeks later HotCo's stock would \"really\nshoot up.\" Tess left the meeting even more uncomfortable, and a few days later came to talk to\nBack Slapper.\nYou are about to call Lucy Lawyer, the partner at HotCo's outside law firm to whom you turn\nwhen you think you may have a serious problem.\nWhat do you think Lucy is going to advise you to do in connection with the insider trading\nlaws, and why?\nWhat do you think Lucy is going to advise you to do in connection with the public offering\nprocess, and why?"

GONE, (won't survive indictment).\n- Board of Directors of SB\n-\nGet rid of everyone who was involved\n-\nMake public statement that you are going to revamp\n-\nGrovel (turn themselves inside out)\n-\nPrograms of compliance\n-\nWaive turning-client privately\n-\nSqueaky-clean team\n- Internal investigation: Moser did it again a couple of times. Perhaps he had tacit\npermission.\n- Investigation turns out clean except for Moser.\n- Adequate supervision.\n- Nobody goes to jail. They are just forced to retire.\n- How could this have been better?\n\n-\nInside council has problem when it comes to compliance \"boss pushing boss\"\n-\nBut if they had called outside law firm, this wouldn't have happened.\n- No such thing as a quiet withdrawal.\n- What should the CEO have done to Moser?\n-\nPut him under supervision?\n-\nDemote him?\n-\nDisclose?\no 1st: fix it internally\no 2nd: Hit the bad people\no 3rd: Tidy things up\no 4th: reevaluate situation\no 5th: Then go to regulators. And explain to them what you've' done and\nensure that it won't ever happen again.\nOutside council gives you leverage.\nStaying Out of Trouble:\n1.) Company you keep is key:\n- Stay away form ethically-challenged people.\n- People who enforce white collar crime have harder times. It's opaque. So you end\nup processing minor and major stuff.\n- Consultants (people come to you when they are in trouble)\n- Tell clients in the beginning:\no Make an assessment early on (set clear expectations)\no No cover-ups\no 100% compliant\n2.) Don't do anything stupid. (ex. Arthur Anderson shredding documents)\n- give us full disclosure\n- if you've lied to us, we will send you to jail policy holds\n- 99/100 times tell the truth (if you lie, you will get caught)\n- Evaluate your instincts\nContracts: (law of the Deal)\n* Freedom of contract: you agree then law enforces it.\nEx. Marriage: \"I do\" (law then tells you what you have to do)\nEx. Doctor-patient\nHOW DO YOU GET A CONTRACT?\n1.) Agreement \"Meeting of the minds\"\n2.) Consideration: \"You scratch my back, and I'll scratch yours\", \"reciprocity\",\ncourts don't' like bosses who overreach.\n3.) Legal capacity. 2 parties should have the capacity to enter the contract.\n\n4.) Formalities (i.e. written, handshake--evidence that there was a contract.)\n5.) Intent to be bound (3 hours walk w/ friend example)"

He is not in the business to sell\nvans or computers.\n- Therefore, you can rely on agent's apparent authority, but ONLY\nREASONABLY.\n- If corporation wants to sell substantially all of its assets, it needs to get permission\nfrom shareholders or Board of Directors. (One doesn't have the capacity to do\nthis)\nBUYER:\n- Risk averse. How does he figure out if seller has capacity to sell the factory?\n- Try to figure out if it will have an impact? Factors? Sales? Financial Matters?\nHow do you find out about these things?\n1.) Get access to information about, due diligence Æ look at files.\n2.) But, what happens if the company doesn't have that many records, and\nyou are scared to go to the seller (you don't trust him)\n3.) Ask for certain kinds of statements/premises in the documents. But you\nhave the problem that you are still taking risks.\n4.) Objective Third Party opinion.\n5.) I want seller to say to its law firm, \"Write a letter addressed to the buyer\".\nIt's called an OPINION LETTER.\ni. It says, \"No outstanding taxes, etc\"\nii. CEO has capacity to do the deal\n\niii. Therefore, you want Seller's law firm to say, \"Based on\ninvestigations, we represent to you that CEO has capacity to do\nthis deal.\"\niv. This law firm will be conservative\nv. If all steps are clean, you can do the deal.\nFormalities:\nPenzoil.\nWhat is the purpose of formalities?\n1.) Gives specifics/evidence\n1.) Intent to bound/clear line\nGetty Case:\nTexaco vs. Penzoil.\n- Penzoil claims that Getty made an agreement to sell the company to Penzoil.\n- Announced to public\n- Texaco offers a better offer, and Getty takes it.\n- Penzoil claims that Getty and them had a contract\n- Texaco may be liable for damages\n- Key Question: Was there a binding agreement?\n- If the parties intended to have a contract before the signing maybe there was a\ndeal.\n- How does the court decide if the jury was right?\n- What does the court look at? Æ Look at page 63, last full paragraph.\n- Court says, \"Was there partial period that the party disclaiming the contract\naccepted?\"\n- Penzoil says start period, I was hustling. We won't tell Getty \"you can have your\ncake and eat it too.\"\n- You can't manipulate formalities.\n- Court spends time looking at press release. Looking for some clear expression of\neach of the parties.\n- Make reasonable inferences.\nCourt looks at grammar.\n- A reasonable jury would have said, \"We have a deal.\"\n- Express agreement: we can infer\n- Implicit agreement: from general commercial practice.\n- Contracts have to have legal purpose.\n- Indemnification\n- If you get into legal trouble, as the corporation, the company will pay the lawyers.\n- But corporation may not be doing well and have little cash.\n- So: Insurance Company will support you. It is important protection. Almost all\ncorporations will provide indemnification insurance.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nInterpretation:\n- Filanto case in Italy\n- Chilwich selling boots to Ranzoexport in NYC\n- Deal falls apart\n- Chilwich gives paper to Filanto (who doesn't sign it)\n- Can Chilwich say to Filanto that we have to settle this in Russia?\n- Filanto says \"NO\"\n- Goes to Russia. Most persuasive court looks at it and says this is a \"mess.\" Filanto\nshould have taken action.\n- Court evaluates \"how reasonable is the clause to go to Russia?\"\n- The end customer is from Russia\n- What is a reasonable delay? Answer: \"reasonable\" time.\n- When you go into a contract dispute, you need \"clean hands.\""

The speed of which people are\ntrying to do things is causing careless errors.\n- If one doesn't fall covenants, one get sued.\n- It takes 30-45 days between signing and closing, because you're getting\nregulatory approvals (filing papers, mechanical nature things)."

Then, if it goes to\nshareholders, they are taxed as well.\n- According to Badge: there is asset acquisition, stock acquisition, and merger. But,\nMartin thinks there are only 2 kinds: asset acquisition and stock acquisition.\nWhen smoke clears, target has disappeared, and buyer has all of the assets.\n- discussed forward triangular mergers\n- taxable transactions\n- What are tax objective's of partners\n- Buyer's objective: acquire assets of a target company with the most beneficial tax\nattributes as possible.\n- If NBV < fair value, then buyer wants to take it with a stepped-up basis so they\ncan claim tax on this basis\n- Tax sheltered cash discussion\n- The buyer in the transaction wants a stepped-up basis\n- C-Corp (basic corp.) Example: GM. treated as a separate tax payer. 35% of\ndividends are taxed.\n- It's hard to buy NOL's around election-time; politicians want to close tax\nloopholes.\n- Seller's (in class he used Gibson as an example) goals\n-\nhe wants to pay as little tax as possible\n-\nwants as much money as he can get\n\n-\nmay want to defer tax if he wants to pay for it\n-\nIf Gibson set up a C corp. and Allen wants to buy it...what happens?\nAllen refers to example 1:\nHe states, what if Gibson doesn't want to sell assets, but stocks?\n-\nBuyer's investment is $13,000. Gibson gets $11,000- 10,000 + tax (.15).\n-\nGibson wants $9500\n- Stand alone corporation: not part of a group\nAllen talked about how to value corporations? What should you consider?\n- one way to value equity, is after tax-value\n- Suppose someone wants to buy a subsidiary of United Tech. Co.\n-\nIntroduces possibility of getting a stepped-up tax basis (to get rapid\ndepreciation) when you buy assets.\n- Buyer will allocate a lot for depreciation and a little to goodwill\n- It is difficult for subsidiary to sell asset by asset by asset.\n- It would be easier to buy stock of the subsidiary. (assume depreciation bookvalue\n= 0)\n- Section 338: Election:\n-\nWhen a corporate buyer buys a C-Corp, the seller and the buyer can elect\nto treat the transaction as an asset transaction even though the buyer\nbought the stock.\n-\nSelling Corp. would have generated a profit on the sale (as if it sold assets)\n-\nThis election would make sense if subsidiary had way to absorb the gain\n- Section 338 - H-10 Election\n-\nThe deemed asset sale is treated as it happened the moment before the\nsale.\n-\nTherefore, UT pays tax, not subsidiary.\n-\nUT is in the same position had it sold stocks (illustrated in Example 2)\n- Forward triangular asset transaction: no need for Section 338.\n- Reverse Triangular merger: has more limitations than a direct merger.\nNon-Taxable reorganizations:\n- entitled to special tax things\n- Allowed to swap tax, without paying current tax... \"carry-over\" basis\n- there is no step-up (swap parent stock for business's asset)\n- sellers don't' get cashÆ they get stock for the new stock or promissory notes\ncalled \"boot\"\n\n- ABC (companies)\n-\nA: assets for stock subject to liabilities\n-\nB: stock for stock swayÆi.e. tender offer\n-\nC: merger forward or direct or triangular\n1.) Limitation to \"boot\" in C corp.\n- if you swap target's assets for stock + cash then this treated as \"boot\"\n- boot makes it hard to qualify a transaction\n2.) substantially \"all\" requirements there will be buyers that may not want to buy al\nof the \"target\"\n- By not taking B, you lost qualification but buyer buys A and B, not C of the\ntarget.\n- Direct mergers are the most permissive.\n- Target mergers entice buyers.\n- 50% needs to be stock and 50% needs to be cash\n- Gain is realized at the extent of the boot that is received.\nB-reorganization:\n* Share stock of B for T\n* Only voting stock can be used (this is a tax problem, so no boot can be used)\n* Difficult to do with a widely-held company, because you may not get all of the shares.\n* This is a tender offer (usually followed by a squeeze-out merger to get 20%)\n* You need 80%\nl"

How do we figure out price\n-\nvalue of assets\n-\ngrowth potential (needs to generate earnings)\n-\nmultiple of cash flows (earnings)\n- The buyer wants to put as many conditions as it can.\n- Seller wants no conditions.\n- If you breach a covenant you get sued.\n- Reps (representation) ties into the conditions to close.\n- Page 37: \"We're in conditions to closing.\"\n- Look at 3:1.A\n- Reps are true on the day you sign and close (w/o taking into account disclosure on\npg. 56)\n- Page 56: Look at Representation: \"The last Rep made by the seller says that the\nabove will be true on the closing date, unless I tell you otherwise in writing.\"\n- The buyer is saying I came up with a price based on the information you gave me\nÆ this is trueÆ if not it's a different game.\n- It's given the buyer a chance to regenerate. If we come to closing, and the\ncompany blows up, then Rep isn't true.\n- These conditions have no material adverse effect.\n- These covenants try to tackle this.\n- Buyer knows that things change.\n- Avoid \"cock-tail\" with the bankers.\n- It is difficult for both the buyer and seller. It is based on the fate of your\nopponents (do they have a good history?)\n- Obligation of good faith: it covers cocktail with bankers. Did the people operate\nin and above the Board's manners?\n\nCovenants:\n* Seller is alert here!\n- Buyer wants seller to take good care of the assets. Why would seller cross this\nout?\n- Once the seller signs, that's it.\n- Seller must continue to conduct its business in the ordinary course.\n- Any time you have 2 provisions dealing with the same stuff it is bad because\ncourt will want to give it more \"power.\" Since they will say what was covered in\n\"E\" was covered in \"A.\"\n- Why is \"material\" so important?\no Without material, if Xerox says \"no\" buyer could say I don't want to close\nbecause you didn't' get every single 3rd parties' consent.\n- Page 46, Figure 5.7\n- Be in accordance with GAAP.\n- Tell us everything you know. Don't hold back secrets.\n- Buyer vies this as a risk-allocation provision. IF something \"crops up\" it is your\n(seller) problem.\n- For example: Should B assume warranty obligations Æ B says NO, but warranty\nexpense is an ongoing expense, and you should have a reserve of it.\nHow do you determine the proper multiple?\n- Market multiple ( you get all of the junk with it)\n- Page 56, Section 5-23.\n- Everything you tell us should be true.\n- If this was a honesty clause, and not a risk clause, then you can't burn anything.\n- IF business went south Æ WHY?\n-\nB/c of market?\n-\nOther competition?\n-\nPricing pressures?\n-\nIs it the seller's job to teach buyer about the market?\n- Everyone should do their homework.\n- Page 62: Indemnification Clause: If you breech a covenant or Rep, I, the Buyer\nget to sue the Seller. Without this clause you can still sue people. It allows you to\nrecover your attorney's fees.\n- There is a risk business people take to buy an asset, because someone else will\nbuy it. That's why if you state 80M, you'll take 40M.\n- If people think that something went wrong, they will sue.\n- How do you defend \"80M\"? Perhaps historical basis or relative?\n- Legal fees: 1-2% of purchase price Æ driven by practice (powerful!)"

The civil penalties are the highest ever\npaid in a case of this type known as --gun jumping.\"\nThe Department today filed a civil antitrust complaint in U.S. District Court for the\nDistrict of Columbia along with a proposed consent decree that, if approved by the Court, would\nresolve the lawsuit.\nThe Department's complaint alleges that, starting in mid 1999, Gemstar and TV Guide\nagreed to stop competing for customers, decided together on prices and terms to be offered, and\njointly managed their interactive program guide business during the mandatory pre-merger\nwaiting period of the Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) Act of 1976. Under the Act, the parties are\nrequired to keep their operations separate so that the Department of Justice can review the\nmerger. The Department said that their --gun jumping\" conduct violated the HSR Act, as well as\nSection 1 of the Sherman Act.\n\n- 2 -\n--Merging parties must remain separate and independent until the end of the statutory\nwaiting period,\" said R. Hewitt Pate, Acting Assistant Attorney General in charge of the\nDepartment's Antitrust Division. --A plan to merge in the future does not justify price fixing,\ncustomer allocation, or otherwise combining their businesses, while the Justice Department is\ninvestigating the competitive effects of the transaction.\"\nThe proposed consent decree prevents Gemstar-TV Guide from engaging in similar\nconduct in the future, and gives customers that signed contracts with TV Guide during the pre-\nmerger period a chance to rescind those contracts.\nPrior to mid-1999, Gemstar and TV Guide competed to provide interactive program\nguides, or IPGs, to cable and satellite television service providers. IPGs allow television\nviewers to use the television remote to view program schedule information and select programs\nfor viewing.\nThe complaint alleged that Gemstar and TV Guide stopped competing for some\ncustomers in June 1999, while they were negotiating a possible joint venture between their two\ncompanies. They subsequently announced that they would merge in October 1999, and filed a\npre-merger notification under the HSR Act. Pending consummation of the transaction, and\nwhile the Department of Justice conducted its review of the transaction, Gemstar and TV Guide\nsecretly agreed to allocate markets and customers between them, agreed on the prices and\nmaterial terms that customers would be offered, and began jointly conducting their IPG business.\nThe complaint alleged that this conduct lessened competition between TV Guide and Gemstar in\nviolation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act, and gave Gemstar premature control over TV Guide\nin violation of the HSR Act.\n\n- 3 -\nThe HSR Act requires companies planning acquisitions or mergers that meet certain\nthresholds to file pre-merger notification documents with the Justice Department and the Federal\nTrade Commission. The HSR Act also requires that the merging parties observe a mandatory\nwaiting period, after which the companies may go ahead with the transaction. The purpose of\nthe waiting period is to give the antitrust agencies an opportunity to investigate proposed\ntransactions, and determine whether they would violate the antitrust laws, so that if the\ngovernment determines that a transaction violates the antitrust laws, it may seek to block that\ntransaction before the waiting period expires. Parties are subject to a maximum civil penalty of\n$11,000 per day for each day they have been found to be in violation of the HSR Act.\nThe proposed Final Judgment, filed along with the complaint, seeks a total civil penalty\nof $5.67 million, reflecting the maximum civil penalties of $11,000 per day per company.\nGemstar-TV Guide, a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in\nPasadena, California, was formed when Gemstar merged with TV Guide in July 2000. It had\nannual revenues of about $1.4 billion for the year ending December 31, 2001, and revenues for\nthe fiscal year ending March 31, 2000, of about $241 million.\nTV Guide Inc., now a wholly-owned subsidiary of Gemstar-TV Guide International Inc.,\nis a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in Tulsa, Oklahoma. For the fiscal\nyear ending December 31, 1999, TV Guide reported revenue of about $1.1 billion.\nAs required by the Tunney Act, the proposed consent decree will be published in the\nFederal Register, along with the Department's competitive impact statement. Any person may\nsubmit comments concerning the proposed decree during a 60-day waiting period to James R.\nWade, Chief, Litigation III, Antitrust Division, U.S. Department of Justice, 325 7th Street, N.W.,\n\n- 4 -\nWashington, D.C. 20530.

Fenn, Nellie Liang, and Stephen Prowse\nThe Federal Reserve Board\nDecember 1995\nSummary: The private equity market has become an important source of funds for start-\nup firms, private middle-market firms, firms in financial distress, and public firms\nseeking buyout financing. Between 1980 and 1994, the amount of private equity\noutstanding rose from less than $5 billion to $100 billion. Despite the market's\nextraordinary growth and its importance to many types of firms, it has received little\nattention in the financial press or the academic literature.\nThis study examines the economic foundations of the private equity market and discusses\nin detail the market's organizational structure. Drawing on publicly available data and\nextensive fieldwork, it describes the major issuers, intermediaries, investors, and agents\nin the market and their interactions with each other. It examines the reasons for the\nmarket's explosive growth over the past fifteen years and highlights the main\ncharacteristics of that growth. Finally, the study provides data on returns to private equity\ninvestors and analyzes the major secular and cyclical influences on returns.\nThe study emphasizes two major themes. One is that the growth of private equity is a\nclassic example of the way organizational innovation, aided by regulatory and tax\nchanges, can ignite activity in a particular market. In this case, the innovation was the\nwidespread adoption of the limited partnership. Until the late 1970s, private equity\ninvestments were undertaken mainly by wealthy families, industrial corporations, and\nfinancial institutions that invested directly in issuing firms. Much of the investment since\n1980, by contrast, has been undertaken by professional private equity managers on behalf\nof institutional investors. The vehicle for organizing this activity is the limited\npartnership, with the institutional investors serving as limited partners and investment\nmanagers as general partners.\nThe emergence of the limited partnership as the dominant form of intermediary is a result\nof the extreme information asymmetries and potential incentive problems that arise in the\nprivate equity market. The specific advantages of limited partnerships are rooted in the\nways in which they address these problems. The general partners specialize in finding,\nstructuring, and managing equity investments in closely held private companies. Because\nthey are among the largest and most active shareholders, partnerships have significant\nmeans of exercising both formal and informal control, and thus they are able to direct\ncompanies to serve the interests of their shareholders. At the same time, partnerships use\norganizational and contractual mechanisms to align the interests of the general and\nlimited partners.\n\nThe second theme of the study is that the growth of the private equity market has\nexpanded access to outside equity capital for both classic start-up companies and\nestablished private companies. Some observers have characterized the growth of non-\nventure private equity as a shift away from traditional venture capital. They attribute the\nshift of investment funds to several factors, including the presence of large institutional\ninvestors that do not want to invest in small funds or small deals, a change in the culture\nof private equity firms, and a decline in venture opportunities. Although these factors\nmay have played a role, the argument that non-venture private equity has driven out\nventure capital seems insupportable, as both types of investment have grown rapidly. We\nargue that the increase in non-venture private equity investment has been due principally\nto an abundance of profitable investment opportunities. Moreover, the available data on\nreturns on private equity investments indicate that during the 1980s, non-venture\ninvesting generated higher returns than did venture investing, suggesting that private\nequity capital has flowed to its most productive uses."

Introduction\nThe private equity market is an important source\nof funds for start-up firms, private middle-market\nfirms, firms in financial distress, and public firms\nseeking buyout financing. Over the past fifteen\nyears it has been the fastest growing market for\ncorporate finance, by an order of magnitude over\nother markets such as the public equity and bond\nmarkets and the market for private placement\ndebt. Today the private equity market is roughly\none-sixth the size of the commercial bank loan\nand commercial paper markets in terms of out-\nstandings, and in recent years private equity\ncapital raised by partnerships has matched, and\nsometimes exceeded, funds raised through initial\npublic offerings and gross issuance of public\nhigh-yield corporate bonds.\nDespite its dramatic growth and increased\nsignificance for corporate finance, the private\nequity market has received little attention in the\nfinancial press or the academic literature.1 The\nlack of attention is due partly to the nature of the\ninstrument itself. A private equity security is\nexempt from registration with the Securities and\nExchange Commission by virtue of its being\nissued in transactions ''not involving any public\noffering.'' Thus, information about private transac\ntions is often limited, and analyzing developments\nin the market is difficult.\nThis study examines the economic foundations\nof the private equity market, analyzes the market's\ndevelopment and current role in corporate finance,\nand describes the market's institutional structure.\nIt examines the reasons for the market's explosive\ngrowth over the past fifteen years and highlights\nthe main characteristics of that growth. And it\ndescribes the important issuers, intermediaries,\ninvestors, and agents in the market and their\ninteractions with each other. Drawing on data from\ntrade journals, the study also estimates the\nmarket's size. Finally, it provides data on returns\nto private equity investors and analyzes the major\nsecular and cyclical influences on returns.\nThe study emphasizes two themes. One is that\nthe growth of private equity is a classic example\nof how organizational innovation, aided by regu\n1. Some studies have been made of particular sectors of the\nmarket, such as venture capital and leveraged buyouts of large\npublic companies. For studies on venture capital, see Sahlman\n(1990) and special issues of Financial Management (Autumn\n1994) and The Financier (May 1994). For a summary of the\nliterature on leveraged buyouts, see Jensen (1994).\nlatory and tax changes, can ignite activity in a\nparticular market. In this case, the innovation was\nthe widespread adoption of the limited partnership\nas the means of organizing private equity invest\nments. Until the late 1970s, private equity invest\nments were undertaken mainly by wealthy\nfamilies, industrial corporations, and financial\ninstitutions investing directly in issuing firms. By\ncontrast, much of the investment since 1980 has\nbeen undertaken by professional private equity\nmanagers on behalf of institutional investors. The\nvehicle for organizing this activity is a limited\npartnership, with the institutional investors as\nlimited partners and the investment managers\nas general partners.\nThe emergence of the limited partnership as the\ndominant form of intermediary is a result of the\nextreme information asymmetries and potential\nincentive problems that arise in the private equity\nmarket. The specific advantages of limited partner\nships are rooted in the ways in which they address\nthese problems. The general partners specialize in\nfinding, structuring, and managing equity invest\nments in closely held private companies. Because\nthey are among the largest and most active\nshareholders, partnerships have significant means\nof exercising both formal and informal control,\nand thus they are able to direct companies to serve\nthe interests of their shareholders. At the same\ntime, partnerships employ organizational and\ncontractual mechanisms that align the interests of\nthe general and limited partners.\nThe development of limited partnerships arose\nfrom the need for greater institutional participation\nin private equity. Few investors had the skills\nnecessary to invest directly in this asset class, and\nthose that did found it difficult to use their skills\nefficiently. Partnership growth was also fostered\nby regulatory changes that permitted greater\nprivate equity investment by pension funds. The\nresults of these changes are telling: From 1980\nto 1994, the amount of capital under management\nby the organized private equity market increased\nfrom roughly $4.7 billion to about $100 billion,\nand limited partnerships went from managing less\nthan 50 percent of private equity investments to\nmanaging more than 80 percent (chart 1).2 Most\n2. The emergence of limited partnerships is actually more\ndramatic than these figures indicate. As recently as 1977,\nlimited partnerships managed less than 20 percent of the\nprivate equity stock.\n\n1.

Venture Economics and staff estimates.\nof the remaining private equity stock is held\ndirectly by investors, but even much of this\ndirect investment activity is the result of knowl\nedge that limited partners have gained investing\nin and alongside partnerships.\nThe second theme of the study is that the\nexpansion of the private equity market has\nincreased access to outside equity capital for both\nclassic start-up companies and established private\ncompanies. Venture capital outstanding increased\ntenfold over 1980-94, from $3 billion to $30 bil\nlion (chart 1). Non-venture private equity out\nstanding, meanwhile, grew from less than $2 bil\nlion to more than $70 billion. Clearly, the growth\nof the private equity market has made it easier not\nonly for start-up companies to acquire adequate\nfinancing through successive stages of growth, but\nalso for middle-market private firms to acquire\nfinancing for expansion.\nWe argue that the increase in non-venture\nprivate equity investment has been due principally\nto an abundance of profitable investment opportu\nnities. Others have characterized the growth of\nnon-venture private equity as a shift away from\ntraditional venture capital. They attribute the shift\nto a variety of factors, including the presence of\nlarge institutional investors that do not want to\ninvest in small funds or small deals; risk-aversion\nand shorter investment horizons among these\ninstitutional investors; a shift in the culture of\nprivate equity firms as general partners who have\nbackgrounds in investment banking replace general\npartners who have entrepreneurial backgrounds;\nand a decline in venture opportunities.3 Although\nthese factors may have played a role, it seems\ndifficult to argue that non-venture private equity\nhas driven out venture capital, as both have grown\nrapidly. Moreover, the available data on returns on\nprivate equity investments indicate that during the\n1980s, non-venture investing generated higher\nreturns than did venture investing. Although such\ndata are tentative, they suggest that private equity\ncapital has flowed to its most productive uses.\nWhat Is the Private Equity Market?\nOur study focuses on the organized private equity\nmarket--professionally managed equity invest\nments in the unregistered securities of private and\npublic companies.4 Professional management is\nprovided by specialized intermediaries and, to a\nlimited extent, by institutional investors. Private\nequity managers acquire large ownership stakes\nand take an active role in monitoring and advising\nportfolio companies. In many cases they exercise\nas much control as company insiders, or more.\nPrivate equity encompasses other markets that\nare distinct from the organized market we\nexamine. One is the market for angel capital--\ninvestments in small, closely held companies by\nwealthy individuals, many of whom have experi\nence operating similar companies. Angel capital\nists may have substantial ownership stakes and\nmay be active in advising the company, but they\ngenerally are not as active as professional man\nagers in monitoring the company and rarely\nexercise control. Many angel investments are\narranged by informal matchmakers, such as\nlawyers or accountants, who only occasionally put\ndeals together and are not full-time agents.5\nAnother distinct market is what we call the\ninformal private equity market. In the informal\nmarket, in which unregistered securities are sold to\ninstitutional investors and accredited individuals,\nthe number of investors in any one company\ntypically is larger, and minimum investments\nsmaller, than in either the organized private equity\nmarket or the angel capital market.

The most common forms are\ncommon stock, convertible preferred stock, and subordinated\ndebt with conversion privileges or warrants.\n5. For a more complete description of the angel capital\nmarket, see Wetzel (1983) and Freear and Wetzel (1990).\n\ntant, ownership is not concentrated among outside\ninvestors; insiders remain the largest and only\nconcentrated group of shareholders. Nor is there a\nlead investor that takes an active role in negotiat\ning the terms of the investment. In certain\nrespects, the informal private equity market\noperates more like the public market for small-cap\nstocks than like the private equity market. Indeed,\nequity issued in the informal private equity market\nis typically shopped around by an agent whose\nrole is similar to that of an underwriter marketing\nsecurities on a best-efforts basis.\nA final distinct market is the Rule 144A private\nequity market. Rule 144A, adopted in 1990 by the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission, establishes\nrules and conditions under which private securities\nmay be freely traded among certain classes of\ninstitutional investors. The rule has spawned a\nmarket for underwritten private equity offerings\nthat are largely bought by the public trading desks\nof institutional investors. The vast majority of\nissues in the Rule 144A market are issued by\npublic firms that want to issue quickly and avoid\nthe delays associated with a registered offering.\nThe market is structured much more like the\npublic equity market than the private market.\nBy some estimates, the angel capital and\ninformal private equity markets are several times\nlarger than the organized private equity market,\nand angel capital in particular is regarded as a\ncritical source of seed capital. However, the lack\nof an institutional infrastructure to support these\nmarkets makes it nearly impossible to obtain\nreliable and comprehensive information about\nthem.\nOverview of the Organized\nPrivate Equity Market\nThe organized private equity market has three\nmajor players and an assortment of minor players\n(diagram 1). The major players are private equity\nissuers, intermediaries, and investors.\nIssuers\nIssuers in the private equity market vary widely in\nsize and their reasons for raising capital as well as\nin other ways. They do share a common trait,\nhowever: Private equity being one of the most\nexpensive forms of finance, issuers generally are\nfirms that cannot raise financing in the debt market\nor the public equity market.\nIssuers of traditional venture capital are young\nfirms, most often firms that are developing\ninnovative technologies and are projected to show\nvery high growth rates in the future. They may be\nearly-stage companies, those still in the research\nand development stage or the earliest stages of\ncommercialization, or later-stage companies, those\nthat have several years of sales but are still trying\nto grow rapidly.\nSince the mid-1980s, non-venture private equity\ninvestment has outpaced venture investment.\nMiddle-market companies, roughly defined as\ncompanies with annual sales of $25 million to\n$500 million, have become increasingly attractive\nto private equity investors. Many of these compa\nnies are stable, profitable businesses in low-\ntechnology manufacturing, distribution, services,\nand retail industries. They use the private equity\nmarket to finance expansion--through new capital\nexpenditures and acquisitions--and to finance\nchanges in capital structure and in ownership (the\nlatter increasingly the result of owners of private\nbusinesses reaching retirement age).\nPublic companies also are issuers in the private\nequity market. Public companies that go private\nissue a combination of debt and private equity\nto finance their management or leveraged buyout.\nIndeed, between the mid- and late 1980s such\ntransactions absorbed most new non-venture\nprivate equity capital. Public companies also issue\nprivate equity to help them through periods of\nfinancial distress and to avoid the registration costs\nand public disclosures associated with public\nofferings.\nIntermediaries\nIntermediaries--mainly limited partnerships--\nmanage an estimated 80 percent of private equity\ninvestments. Under the partnership arrangement,\ninstitutional investors are the limited partners and\nprofessional private equity managers, working as a\nteam, serve as the general partners. In most cases\nthe general partners are associated with a partner\nship management firm, such as the venture capital\nfirm Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield, and Byers or the\nbuyout group Kohlberg, Kravis, and Roberts.\nSome of the management firms are affiliates of a\nfinancial institution (an insurance company, bank\nholding company, or investment bank); the\naffiliated firms generally are structured and\nmanaged no differently than independent partner\nship management firms.\n\nDiagram 1.

Two characteristics of partnerships act\nto reduce these conflicts. If partnership managers\nare to raise new partnerships in the future, they\nmust establish favorable track records. In addition,\nthey receive a significant amount of their compen\nsation in the form of shares of the partnership's\nprofits.\nIntermediaries not organized as limited\npartnerships--Small Business Investment Compa\nnies (SBICs), publicly traded investment compa\nnies, and other companies--today play only a\nmarginal role in the private equity market. SBICs,\nestablished in 1958 as a means of encouraging\ninvestment in private equity, can leverage their\n- Locate equity investors\nprivate capital with loans from, or guaranteed by,\nthe Small Business Administration. In the 1960s\nand 1970s they accounted for as much as one-third\nof private equity investment, but today they\naccount for less than $1 billion of the $100 billion\nmarket. Their reduced role has resulted in part\nfrom their inability to make long-term equity\ninvestments when they themselves are financed\nwith debt. Publicly traded investment companies\nalso played a role in the past, but today fewer than\na dozen such companies are active, and together\nthey manage less than $300 million. It has become\napparent that the long-term nature of private\nequity investing is not compatible with the\nshort-term investment horizons of stock analysts\nand public investors.\nTwo other types of private equity organizations\nare SBICs owned by bank holding companies and\nventure capital subsidiaries of nonfinancial cor\n\nporations. Organizations of both types were\nextremely important in the 1960s, and they still\nmanage significant amounts of private equity.\nHowever, these organizations invest only their\ncorporate parent's capital. In this sense, neither\nis really an intermediary, but rather a conduit for\ndirect investments. We treat the investments by\nthese organizations as direct investments, not as\ninvestments by intermediaries.\nInvestors\nA variety of groups invest in the private equity\nmarket. Public and corporate pension funds are the\nlargest investor groups, together holding roughly\n40 percent of capital outstanding and currently\nsupplying close to 50 percent of all new funds\nraised by partnerships.6 Public pension funds make\nup the fastest growing group and recently overtook\nprivate pension funds in terms of the amount\nof private equity held. Pension funds are followed\nby endowments and foundations, bank holding\ncompanies, and wealthy families and individuals,\neach of which holds about 10 percent of total\nprivate equity. Insurance companies, investment\nbanks, nonfinancial corporations, and foreign\ninvestors are the remaining major investor groups.\nOver the 1980s the investor base within each\ninvestor group broadened dramatically, but still\nonly a minority of institutions within each group\n(generally the larger institutions) hold private\nequity.\nMost institutional investors invest in private\nequity for strictly financial reasons, specifically\nbecause they expect the risk-adjusted returns on\nprivate equity to be higher than the risk-adjusted\nreturns on other investments and because of the\npotential benefits of diversification.7 Bank holding\ncompanies, investment banks, and nonfinancial\ncorporations may also choose to invest in the\nprivate equity market to take advantage of econo\nmies of scope between private equity investing\nand their other activities.\n6. These and other figures in this section are our estimates\nbased on information from a variety of sources. Methods of\nestimation are discussed in the appendix.\n7. Private equity is often included in a portfolio of ''alterna\ntive assets'' that also includes distressed debt, emerging market\nstocks, real estate, oil and gas, timber and farmland, and\neconomically targeted investments.\nAgents and Advisers\nAlso important in the private equity market is a\ngroup of ''information producers'' whose role has\nincreased significantly in recent years. These are\nthe agents and advisers who place private equity,\nraise funds for private equity partnerships, and\nevaluate partnerships for potential investors. They\nexist because they reduce the costs associated with\nthe information problems that arise in private\nequity investing. Agents facilitate the search by\nprivate companies for equity capital and the search\nby limited partnerships for institutional investors;\nthey also advise on the structure, timing, and\npricing of private equity issues and assist in\nnegotiations. Advisers facilitate the evaluation by\ninstitutional investors of limited partnerships in\nwhich to invest; they appear to be particularly\nvaluable to financial institutions that are unfamiliar\nwith the workings of the private equity market.\nSources of Data\nAny analysis of the private equity market is\nhandicapped by a lack of readily available infor\nmation. Because private equity securities are not\nregistered with the Securities Exchange Commis\nsion, only limited data about private equity\nofferings are publicly available. Further, many of\nthe firms that issue private equity securities are\nprivate, and they do not disclose financial and\noperating data about themselves. In addition,\nrelatively little has been written about the market.\nTo the extent possible we have relied on public\nsources of data, primarily organizations that\ncollect data and publish newsletters and reports for\nthe private equity community. We have also held\nextensive interviews with market participants. Our\ninterviewees are active participants in the market\nand include staff members of corporate and public\npension funds, life insurance companies, major\nendowments, investment banks, commercial bank\nholding companies, and a variety of private\nlimited partnerships that cover the spectrum of\nprivate equity investing. Where publicly available\ndata are lacking we rely heavily on the informa\ntion obtained from these interviews, but our\nconclusions are not based on any single source\nof information.\n\n2. Development of the Private Equity Market\nThis chapter describes the development of the\norganized private equity market from its origins as\na small, informal market devoted exclusively to\nthe provision of venture finance in the early post-\nWorld War II period to the much larger, more\nheterogeneous market of today. Also presented are\ndata documenting the growth of the private equity\nmarket in the 1980s.\nThe Early Stages: 1946 to 1969\nOrganized and professionally managed investments\nin private equity can be dated to 1946 and the\nformation of the American Research and Devel\nopment Corporation (ARD), a publicly traded,\nclosed-end investment company. The formation of\nARD grew out of the intense concern in the 1930s\nand early 1940s about the inadequate rate of new\nbusiness formation and the unavailability of\nlong-term financing for new ventures (Liles,\n1977). Throughout the period there were repeated\ncalls for government programs of various types,\nsome proposing the use of existing New Deal\nagencies such as the Reconstruction Finance\nCorporation and others suggesting the creation\nof new agencies and programs.\nA major goal of ARD's founders--who\nincluded Ralph Flanders, President of the Federal\nReserve Bank of Boston, and General Georges\nDoriot, a Harvard Business School professor--was\nto devise a private-sector solution to the lack of\nfinancing for new enterprises and small businesses.\nThe founders recognized that a growing proportion\nof the nation's wealth was becoming concentrated\nin the hands of financial institutions rather than\nindividuals, who had traditionally been the major\nsource of funds for small businesses. Thus, they\nhoped to design a private-sector institution that\nattracted institutional investors. A second major\ngoal of ARD's founders was to create an institu\ntion that provided managerial expertise as well as\ncapital to new businesses. This objective reflected\ntheir belief that management skill and experience\nwere as critical as adequate financing to the\nsuccess or failure of a new business. Finally,\nARD sought to develop, among its own staff,\nprofessional managers of new venture investments.\nIn this respect, the development of ARD paral\nleled the postwar creation of professional organi\nzations to manage the venture capital investments\nof wealthy families such as the Paysons,\nRockefellers, and Whitneys.\nHowever, ARD failed to attract much interest\namong institutional investors, despite persistent\npromotional efforts by its officers and directors.\nThe company initially raised only $3.5 million of\nthe $5 million it hoped to raise in 1946. It needed\nto raise additional funds in 1949 because its initial\ninvestments depleted its capital before its portfolio\ncompanies started to generate profits. Partly\nbecause investors did not fully appreciate the\nfinancing needs of new companies and partly\nbecause stock analysts focused on current earn\nings, ARD raised only $1.7 million of the addi\ntional $4 million it sought, and only in a private\noffering. In 1951, it finally succeeded in obtaining\nan underwriting and raised an additional $2.3 mil\nlion. However, over the next eight years ARD\nstock often sold at a discount of 20 percent or\nmore, and the company had to rely on the sale\nof portfolio companies for liquidity rather than\nsuffer dilution by issuing additional stock.\nARD eventually was profitable, providing its\noriginal investors with a 15.8 percent annual rate\nof return over its twenty-five years as an indepen\ndent firm.8 It was also highly successful in\nproviding firms with managerial assistance, as\nindicated by the small number of its investments\nthat lost money.9 However, because the company\nwas regarded as, at best, a modest success over its\nearly life, there was no effort to imitate it. No\nother publicly traded venture capital companies\nwere formed until the first publicly traded Small\nBusiness Investment Companies (SBICs) were\norganized thirteen years later.10\nSome private venture capital companies were\nformed during the period. The largest of these\nwere established to manage the venture capital\ninvestments of wealthy families and did not\nfunction as intermediaries investing institutional\ncapital.11 Many private equity investments in the\n1950s were funded on an ad hoc, deal-by-deal\n8. Excluding its $70,000 investment in Digital Equipment\nCorporation--which accounted for less than 0.2 percent of its\ntotal investment of $48 million--ARD's return was only\n7.4 percent (Liles, 1977, p. 83). The return on the Dow Jones\nIndustrial Average over the same period was 12.8 percent.\n9. In its twenty-five years, ARD reported losses of only\n$5.5 million, less than 12 percent of its total investment (Ibid.,\np. 84).\n10. Ibid., p. 9.\n11. Ibid., p. 3.\n\nbasis by syndicates of wealthy individuals, corpo\nrations, and institutional investors organized by\ninvestment bankers (Investment Bankers Associa\ntion of America, 1955).\nPartly because of the absence of a visible insti\ntutional infrastructure for financing new ventures,\nthe impression that private equity capital was in\nshort supply persisted throughout the 1950s.12 This\nperception was reinforced by such events as the\nSoviet Union's launching of Sputnik in 1957.\nTo remedy the situation, Congress took steps to\npromote venture capital investments by individu\nals. One of the steps was passage of section 1244\nof the Internal Revenue Code to allow individuals\nwho invested $25,000 in small new businesses\nto write off any capital losses against ordinary\nincome. The major piece of legislation, however,\nwas the Small Business Investment Act of 1958,\nwhich established Small Business Investment\nCompanies.\nSBICs are private corporations licensed by the\nSmall Business Administration (SBA) to provide\nprofessionally managed capital to risky companies.\nTo encourage their formation, SBICs were allowed\nto supplement their private capital with SBA loans\nand were eligible for certain tax benefits. In\nreturn, SBICs were subject to certain investment\nrestrictions, including limitations on the size of the\ncompanies in which they invested and restrictions\non taking controlling interests in companies.\nIn response to the government's active promo\ntion of SBICs and the availability of low-cost\nmoney, 692 SBIC licenses were granted during the\nprogram's first five years.13 These firms managed\n$464 million of private capital and included\nforty-seven publicly owned SBICs that raised\n$350 million through public offerings.14 By\ncomparison, ARD raised only $7.4 million in its\nfirst thirteen years. The SBIC program suffered\nfrom several defects, however.\nFirst, not all SBICs provided equity financing to\nnew ventures. In particular, SBICs that took\nadvantage of the leverage provided by SBA loans\nwere themselves required to make interest pay\n12. In 1958 the Federal Reserve conducted a comprehensive\nreview of the existing research on small business finance\n(Board of Governors, 1958). On the basis of this review and its\nown surveys of potential institutional investors, the Board\nconcluded that the availability of long-term loan and equity\ncapital was inadequate. For dissenting views, see Schweiger\n(1958) and George and Landry (1959).\n13. Liles, 1977, p. 4.\n14. ''SBICs After 25 Years: Pioneers and Builders of\nOrganized Venture Capital,'' Venture Capital Journal, October\n1983; Liles, 1977, p. 94.\nments, and thus they concentrated on providing\ndebt financing to small businesses that had\npositive cash flows. Second, SBICs attracted\nmainly individual rather than institutional inves\ntors, especially the publicly traded SBICs, which\nwere among the largest in the program's early\nyears. These individual investors did not fully\nappreciate the risks and difficulty of private equity\ninvesting. Indeed, bearish sentiment during 1963\ncaused public SBICs to trade at an average\ndiscount of 40 percent, making them attractive\ntargets for takeovers and liquidations.15\nA third defect of the SBIC program, and the\nmost damaging, was that the program did not\nattract investment managers of the highest caliber.\nIn June 1966, an outgoing deputy administrator of\nthe SBA startled the venture capital community\nand the Congress by declaring that the SBA was\nlikely to lose $18 million because of the ''wrong\npeople who operate SBICs.''16 He went on to\nestimate that, as a result of ''dubious practices and\nself dealing,'' 232 of the nation's 700 SBICs were\n''problem companies.'' This revelation led to an\nSBA promise to audit all SBICs within a four-\nmonth period and to passage of legislation later\nthat year giving the SBA broad new enforcement\nand supervisory powers.17 By 1977 the number of\nSBICs had fallen to 276.18\nDespite their difficulties, SBICs channeled\nrecord amounts of equity financing to small,\nfast-growing companies. Among the larger SBICs\nthat operated throughout the 1960s were about\ntwenty-three that were subsidiaries of bank\nholding companies.19 These organizations used\ntheir SBIC licenses to invest their holding compa\nnies' capital in small companies, an activity that\nmight otherwise have violated bank holding\ncompany regulations regarding equity invest-\nments.20 On the whole, SBICs owned by bank\nholding companies were managed more soundly\nthan were independent SBICs, and because they\ndid not borrow funds from the SBA, they could\nmake pure equity investments. Indeed, they\nprovided a training ground for many venture\n15. Liles, 1977, p. 124.\n16. Ibid.\n17. Ibid., p. 125-26. The SBA went on record saying that it\nintended to strictly enforce all regulatory requirements and that\nit aimed to pare the industry down to 250 good companies.\n18. ''SBICs After 25 Years.''\n19.

Their principal\ndrawback was that they were subject to the same\ninvestment restrictions that applied to independent\nSBICs.\nSeeds for Future Growth: The 1970s and\nthe Limited Partnership\nA hot new-issues market in 1968-69 brought to\na successful conclusion many of the new venture\ninvestments made during the 1960s. Though they\nhad gained valuable experience and enjoyed\nmodest personal rewards, private equity profes\nsionals saw an opportunity to improve upon\nexisting arrangements. This provided the impetus\nfor the formation of a significant number of\nventure capital limited partnerships.21\nAt Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette (DLJ), for\nexample, a venture capital partnership manage\nment unit, Sprout Group, was formed to centralize\nand professionalize the firm's private equity\nactivities. DLJ had been active in organizing\nindividual deals in the 1960s, with the result that\n''people in every department were dabbling in\nventure capital.'' 22 Limited partnerships also were\nattractive to many private equity professionals as\na way of addressing the problem of compensation.\nUnder the Investment Company Act of 1940,\nmanagers of publicly traded venture capital firms\n(including publicly held SBICs) could not receive\nstock options or other forms of performance-based\ncompensation.23 Even where there were no legal\nrestrictions--at bank-affiliated SBICs and on the\nstaffs of institutional investors, for example--\nmost private equity professionals received only\na salary.24 These salaries seemed especially\ninadequate compared with the earnings of the\ngeneral partners at the handful of existing venture\n21. Bygrave and Timmons (1992) credit Tommy Davis and\nArthur Rock with developing the first limited partnership in\n1961. According to Harvard Business School professor Josh\nLerner, the firm Draper, Gaither, and Anderson was first in\n1958. Another early partnership was Greylock's $10 million\nfund, organized in 1965 by former ARD Senior Vice President\nWilliam Elfers.\n22. Ann M. Morrison, ''The Venture Capitalist Who Tries\nTo Win Them All,'' Fortune, January 28, 1980.\n23. Liles, 1977, pp. 73-82. This restriction led to the\ndeparture of several key ARD staff members in the 1950s and\nagain in the mid-1960s.\n24. See Ned Heizer's discussion of his departure from\nAllstate in ''I Remember 1969,'' Venture Capital Journal,\nDecember 1994. See also ''Bank Venture Capital Groups--\nTen Years of Changing Participants and Structures,'' Venture\nCapital Journal, March 1988.\ncapital partnerships. Finally, limited partnerships\nwere attractive as a way of avoiding SBIC-type\ninvestment restrictions and attracting investors\nmore sophisticated than the retail shareholders of\npublicly traded SBICs.\nIn 1969, newly formed venture capital partner\nships raised a record $171 million.25 In general,\nthese partnerships were small ($2.5 million to\n$10 million) and raised money from individual\ninvestors; however, one, Heizer Corporation,\nraised $80 million from thirty-five institutional\ninvestors. Between 1969 and 1975, approximately\ntwenty-nine limited partnerships were formed,\nraising a total of $376 million.26 Organized\nventure capital financing through limited part\nnerships was beginning to be recognized as an\nindustry, and in 1973 the National Venture Capital\nAssociation was formed.\nInvestment Activity\nIronically, soon after these early venture capital\npartnerships were formed, several factors con\nverged to slow venture capital investment for\nnearly a decade. In the mid-1970s the market for\ninitial public offerings virtually disappeared,\nespecially for smaller firms.27 Russell Carson,\npresident of Citicorp's venture unit, noted: ''Five\nor ten years ago, you could take a bright idea,\nbuild up a $5 million-a-year business, and quickly\ntake it public. Those days are over.''28 At the same\ntime, a recession and a weak stock market damp\nened the investment and acquisition activities of\ncorporations, shutting off acquisitions as an\nalternative means of cashing out private equity\ninvestments. Given the poor exit conditions,\nprivate equity managers became extremely\nreluctant to finance new ventures. Moreover, they\nwere forced to invest additional time and funds in\ncompanies already in their portfolios, leaving\nfewer resources available for new investments.\n25. Among the important organizations that formed first-\ntime partnerships in 1969 were TA Associates (Advent I),\nPatricof and Company (Decahedron Partners), the Mayfield\nFund (Mayfield I), and the Sprout Group (Sprout I). See Stan\nPratt, ''The Long Road From 1969: A 25 Year Rollercoaster,''\nVenture Capital Journal, December 1994.\n26. Venture Economics (1994b).\n27. During 1973-75, only 81 IPOs raised $5 million or\nless; in contrast, in 1969, 548 IPOs raised $5 million or less\n(Ibbotson, Sindelar, and Ritter, 1988; and U.S. Small Business\nAdministration, 1977).\n28. Philip Revzin, ''Fledgling Firms Find Risk Capital Still\nFlies Far Out of Their Reach,'' Wall Street Journal, Novem\nber 9, 1976.\n\nAnother important factor slowing venture capital\ninvestment, according to industry participants,\nwas a shortage of qualified entrepreneurs to run\nstart-up companies.29 Contributing to the shortage\nwas a series of tax changes that made stock-based\ncompensation less attractive: Capital gains tax\nrates increased sharply in 1969,30 and the tax\ntreatment of employee stock options was changed\nso that tax liabilities were incurred when options\nwere exercised rather than when the stock was\nsold.31\nAs a result, relatively few start-ups were\nfinanced in the 1970s. For example, only one of\nfive companies in which Institutional Venture\nAssociates (IVA), a newly organized partnership,\ninvested between mid-1974 and November 1976\nwas a true start-up.32 A survey by the National\nVenture Capital Association found that in 1974-75\nonly a quarter of its members' investments, or\n$74 million out of $292 million, went to start-ups\nand other first-round financings.33 However,\nbecause only the start-ups with the greatest growth\nprospects were financed and because these\ncompanies received a great deal of attention from\nexperienced venture capitalists, they yielded\nreturns that were sometimes extraordinary and that\non average were very high. Such returns helped\npave the way for the industry's explosive growth\nin the 1980s.\nConditions during the 1970s not only discour\naged investments in start-ups but also forced fund\nmanagers and other venture capitalists to develop\nstrategies for non-venture private equity investing.\nNarragansett, a publicly traded SBIC, began\nacquiring divisions of large conglomerates after\nhaving spent the 1960s backing new ventures.\nBetween 1971 and 1979, Narragansett made\nsixteen acquisitions through leveraged buyouts,\nand only two of the sixteen yielded disappointing\nresults.34 Many of the newly formed partnerships\n29.

The company split its equity interest\n50-50 with company managers, who had to pay cash for their\nshares and in many cases had to ''hock their homes to make\nthe ante.'' See Royal Little, ''How I'm Deconglomerating the\nConglomerates,'' Fortune, July 16, 1979.\nfollowed a similar strategy: Between 1970 and\n1979, only $13 million of Sprout's $62 million\nin investments were in start-ups; much of the\nremainder was in leveraged buyouts (LBOs).35\nIn spite of the burst of fund raising in 1969, the\norganized private equity market grew little over\nthe next eight years. Total capital, measured at\ncost, remained unchanged at about $2.5 billion to\n$3.0 billion between 1969 and 1977. Private\nequity investments ranged between $250 million\nand $450 million a year over the period, and, as\nsuggested above, a large proportion of the funds\nwent to larger, more established companies.\nBetween 1970 and 1977, investors committed less\nthan $100 million a year in new funds to the\nprivate equity market, most of it to partnerships.36\nRegulatory and Tax Changes\nBy 1977, public concern had focused once again\non the shortage of capital available to finance new\nventures. In an SBA task force report (U.S. Small\nBusiness Administration, 1977) and in congres\nsional testimony, members of the venture capital\nindustry recommended changes in Employee\nRetirement Income Security Act (ERISA) regu\nlations, taxes, and securities laws as a way of\nrevitalizing the venture capital industry. Several\nof the recommendations were implemented during\n1978-80 and appear to have been instrumental in\nfueling the rapid growth in venture capital and\nprivate equity that followed.\nWithout question the most significant change\nwas the Department of Labor decision pertaining\nto the ''prudent man'' provision of ERISA\ngoverning pension fund investing. This provision\nrequires that pension fund investments be based on\nthe judgment of a ''prudent man'' and had been\nwidely interpreted as prohibiting pension fund\ninvestments in securities issued by small or new\ncompanies and venture capital funds. The Labor\nDepartment ruled that such investments are\npermitted, provided they do not endanger an entire\nportfolio.37 This interpretation, which was pro\nposed in September 1978 and was adopted nine\n35.

The difference between new investments in\nportfolio companies, $250 million to $450 million a year, and\nnew investor commitments to venture capital organizations,\n$100 million a year, represents funds that were reinvested by\nexisting venture capital organizations.\n37. Wall Street Journal, June 21, 1979.\n\nmonths later, almost immediately triggered a\nresponse in the market for small-company stocks\nand the new-issues market.38 The reinvigorated\nnew-issues market enabled partnerships to exit\nmore of their investments, return funds to inves\ntors, and raise new partnerships. It also made\ninvestments in new ventures more attractive to\npartnership managers. Indeed, the National\nVenture Capital Association reported that in 1979,\n80 percent of its members' investments were in\nventure capital rather than in leveraged buyouts\nor other established firms.39\nAlthough the Labor Department decision's\ninitial impact was to reinvigorate the new-issues\nmarket, its long-run impact was to encourage\ninvestments by pension funds in private equity\npartnerships. Pension fund managers had long\nregarded venture capital investments as a poten\ntial violation of their fiduciary responsibilities.\nERISA's passage in 1974 only reinforced this\nconservative attitude. Between 1976 and 1978,\nventure capital partnerships raised less than\n$5 million a year from ERISA pension plans.\nIn the first six months of 1979, by contrast, they\nraised $50 million from such plans.40\nBefore ERISA-plan investments increased\nfurther, several other regulatory hurdles were\nraised. In August 1979, the Department of\nLabor ruled that limited partnership investments\nare ERISA ''plan assets.'' This ruling had\nsignificant implications because, under ERISA,\noutside managers of ''plan assets'' must be\nregistered as advisers under the Investment\nAdvisers Act of 1940. Registered advisers are\nprohibited from receiving performance-related\ncompensation, a key feature of private equity\nlimited partnerships. Moreover, under the ruling\ngeneral partners would be considered fiduciaries of\nERISA plan assets, subjecting them to ''prohibited\ntransactions'' rules that would make structuring\npartnership investments more difficult.41\nThe venture capital community fought hard\nagainst the ruling. The following year, the Depart\nment of Labor reversed its ruling and granted\npartnerships, as venture capital operating compa\nnies, a ''safe harbor'' exemption from plan asset\n38.

According to congressional\ntestimony, venture capital fund managers had\nnever been compelled to register under the\nInvestment Advisers Act because ''the plain\nlanguage of the Act distinguishes the activities\nof an investment adviser from those of a venture\ncapital fund manager.'' Nonetheless, during the\n1970s various members of the Securities and\nExchange Commission suggested that venture\ncapital fund managers may in fact be investment\nadvisers, in which case ''the advisee is not the\nlimited partnership itself, but each of the limited\npartners.'' Because registration under the Invest\nment Advisers Act is not required when an adviser\nhas fourteen or fewer clients, many partnerships\nhad restricted their size to fourteen limited\npartners. The Small Business Investment Incentive\nAct of 1980 rendered this limitation unnecessary\nby redefining private equity partnerships as\nbusiness development companies, thus exempting\nthem from the Investment Advisers Act.44\nThese regulatory changes were critical in\nincreasing the flow of venture capital. Congress\nalso sought to increase the flow by reducing the\ncapital gains tax. The maximum capital gains tax\nrate was cut from 491⁄2 percent to 28 percent in\n1978, and to 20 percent in 1981. Also, passage of\nthe Incentive Stock Option Law in 1981 allowed\nthe resumption of the earlier practice of using\nstock options as compensation by deferring the tax\nliability to when the stocks were sold rather than\nwhen the options were exercised.\nExplosive Growth: The 1980s and 1990s\nThe evolution of the limited partnership in com\nbination with the numerous favorable regulatory\nand tax changes spurred the flow of capital to the\n42.

Under the safe harbor\nexemption, pension plan investments in private equity partner\nships are treated the same as investments in ordinary operating\ncompanies provided the partnership meets certain conditions.\nThese conditions pertain mainly to a partnership having\n''management rights'' in the firms in which it invests. As Todd\nnotes in ''Labor Department Limits Initial Takedowns,'' final\nadoption of these regulations did not come until 1986.\n43. ''Venturing into Limbo,'' The Economist, April 5, 1980.\n44.

Commitments to private\nequity partnerships during 1980-82 totaled more\nthan $3.5 billion (chart 2), two and one-half times\nthe commitments to private equity during the\nentire decade of the 1970s.45 Over the next three\nyears, commitments surged to more than $4 billion\nannually. In 1986 and 1987 commitments more\nthan doubled each year, reaching a 1987 peak\n45. Note that two-thirds of commitments during the 1970s\nwere raised in 1978-79 (Pratt, 1982).\nWe rely on two sources of data for partnership commitments\nsince 1980: The Private Equity Analyst (PEA) and Venture\nEconomics Investor Services (VE), which is affiliated with the\npublishers of Venture Capital Journal. Both sources construct\ndata on commitments to limited partnerships by collecting\ninformation from institutional investors and private equity\nfirms. However, because commitments are private, the sources'\nestimates invariably differ. Their estimates also differ because\nthey use different dating conventions: PEA records commit\nments to partnerships in the year in which the commitments are\nmade, whereas VE records commitments in the year in which\nthe partnerships are formed.\nof $17.8 billion. Since then, commitments have\nfollowed a cyclical pattern, reaching a low of\n$6.4 billion in 1990 and a high of $19.4 billion\nin 1994.\nAlthough capital committed to venture capital\npartnerships increased at a healthy rate throughout\nthe 1980s, the lion's share of the growth was in\npartnerships dedicated to non-venture financing.\nThe growth of capital since 1980 in each of these\nsectors--venture and non-venture--is discussed\nbelow.\nVenture Capital\nIn the early 1980s, the surge in private equity\ncommitments was mainly toward venture capital\npartnerships. From 1980 to 1984 venture capital\npartnership commitments increased fivefold, from\n$600 million to $3 billion (chart 2). The increase\nwas due in part to the success of several partner\nships established in the 1970s. These partnerships\nwere, by the late 1970s, reporting annual returns\nin excess of 20 percent, driven by successful\ninvestments in Apple Computer, Genentech, Intel,\nFederal Express, Qume Corporation, and Tandem\nComputers among other firms. These high returns\nattracted the attention of institutional investors,\nespecially pension funds, many of which had\nexperienced sluggish public equity returns\nthroughout the 1970s. Commitments to venture\ncapital partnerships also grew as investors in the\noriginal partnerships reinvested their gains when\nthese partnerships were liquidated.\nFollowing the 1980-84 surge, commitments\nto venture capital partnerships leveled off and\nfluctuated between approximately $2 billion and\n$3 billion over the next five years. Commitments\nfell during the 1990-91 recession, reflecting not\nonly the reduced demand for venture capital but\nalso the asset-quality problems of a number of\nlarge institutional investors, notably banks and\ninsurance companies. Commitments rebounded\nduring 1992-93, however, and in 1994 they\nreached a new high of $4.2 billion.\nThis level of partnership commitments during\nthe 1980s resulted in an eightfold increase in the\nventure capital stock, from $4.5 billion in 1980\nto $36 billion in 1990 (table 1). As the venture\ncapital stock grew, partnerships managed an\nincreasing share. In 1980, partnerships managed\nonly 40 percent of the $4.5 billion in outstanding\nventure capital, while venture capital subsidiaries\nof financial and industrial companies (including\nbank-affiliated SBICs) managed 31 percent and\nindependent SBICs 29 percent.

The percentage of new\npartnerships focusing on investments in early-stage\ncompanies exhibited no clear trend but fluctuated\nconsiderably around its long-run average (36 per\ncent in terms of the number of funds, 26 percent\nin terms of dollars raised). The fluctuations were\ndue partly to changes in the mix of partnerships\n(early-stage or later-stage) that happened to be\nbeginning a new fund-raising cycle each year.\nMany market participants suggest that as the\nsize of partnerships increases, increasing the\naverage size of investments is more efficient than\nincreasing the number of investments. They also\nemphasize that later-stage investments require less\nwork for the general partners than investments in\nstart-up firms and early-stage new ventures. These\nobservations underlie the widespread perception\nthat the increase in average fund size has been\naccompanied by a shift toward larger and later-\nstage investments.\n46. For tables 2 and 3, we use data from Venture Economics\nexclusively because that source provides data on the investment\nfocus of venture capital partnerships and the actual investments\nmade by those partnerships.\n2. Leveraged buyout investments by venture capital partner\nships as a percentage of total investments; included in numbers\nfor later-stage investments.\nSource. Venture Capital Journal.\nSomewhat surprisingly, data on investments\nsuggest only moderate shifts toward larger\ninvestments and investments in later-stage new\nventures (table 3). Average investment size\nincreased 40 percent from the early 1980s to the\nearly 1990s, significantly less than the increase in\naverage fund size. Over the same period, the ratio\nof early-stage investments to total investments\ndeclined only slightly and remained near 30 per\ncent even during 1987-88, peak years of LBO\nfinancing by venture capital partnerships. More\nrecently, early-stage investments accounted for\na record high 37 percent of total investments in\n1994.\nNon-Venture Private Equity\nUntil the early 1980s, funds for non-venture\nprivate equity investments came from venture\ncapital partnerships and informal investor groups\norganized by investment banks and other agents.\nDuring the 1980s, however, a sizable number of\nlarge partnerships were created specifically to\nprovide equity capital for non-venture financing\nneeds. Non-venture partnerships received commit\nments of about $1.8 billion in 1983, and roughly\nthe same amount was raised in each of the next\ntwo years (chart 2). In 1986, however, non-venture\npartnerships raised more than $6.8 billion, well\n\nsurpassing the $2 billion raised by venture capital\npartnerships that year, and in 1987 non-venture\npartnership commitments soared to $14.6 billion.\nPartnerships raised in 1987 included Kohlberg,\nKravis, and Roberts' record $5.6 billion fund,\nwhich by itself was almost twice the total commit\nments to all venture capital partnerships that year.\nFund raising for non-venture partnerships\ndropped substantially in 1990 and 1991 as public\nbuyout activity slowed and the recession reduced\nthe demand for new investment financing. Since\n1992, however, fund raising has increased steadily\nas the economic recovery and the accompanying\nincrease in activity in the IPO and junk bond\nmarkets has increased the demand for non-venture\nprivate equity. In 1994, non-venture partnership\ncommitments reached a new high of $15.1 billion.\nNon-venture partnerships are generally much\nlarger than venture partnerships, with a number\nexceeding $1 billion. Partnerships of this size\nare especially attractive to public pension funds,\nwhich often invest in minimum amounts of\n$10 million to $25 million so as to reduce moni\ntoring burdens on their limited staffs. Also, public\npension funds typically operate under a restriction\nthat their investment in any one limited partner\nship not constitute more than 10 percent of the\npartnership's total funds; a partnership in which\na public pension fund invests $15 million, for\nexample, must raise at least $150 million to\naccommodate the public pension fund investor. In\n1994, the median size of non-venture partnerships\nwas $175 million, compared with $61 million for\nventure partnerships.47\nAs non-venture financing grew over the mid-\nand late 1980s, partnerships developed specialized\ninvestment practices. Among the largest and most\npublicized partnerships were those that specialized\nin leveraged buyouts of large public companies.\nParallelling their growth was the formation of\npartnerships that provided mezzanine financing\nto firms undergoing leveraged buyouts. Mezzanine\nfinancing, which takes the form of subordinated\ndebt with equity conversion privilege or warrants,\nwas often provided in conjunction with equity\nfrom a related buyout partnership. Commitments\nto both LBO and mezzanine funds peaked in the\nlate 1980s.\nAs the mix of investment opportunities has\nchanged, so too has the investment focus of the\nspecialized funds. Several prominent buyout\npartnerships, for example, have recently expanded\ntheir financing activities to include a ''buy and\n47. The Private Equity Analyst, January 1995.\nbuild'' strategy in industries that are experiencing\npressures to consolidate.48 For the purpose of\nmaking strategic acquisitions, the partnership\nprovides equity capital to a firm that has the\npotential to be a market leader in the newly\nstructured industry. This investment strategy has\ntaken hold in such diverse industries as publish\ning, cable TV, radio, and basic manufacturing.\nMore recent examples of specialization include\npartnerships that invest in firms in financial\ndistress, take minority positions in middle-market\nfirms, or invest in a single industry. As of 1993,\nfor example, at least ten partnerships were focus\ning on financially distressed firms that managed\nabout $4 billion in capital.49 Partnerships that\nspecialize in taking minority interests typically\ntarget companies that have less than $1 billion\nin market capitalization and equity capital needs\nof $10 million to $50 million; targeted companies\ninclude public middle-market firms that, for one of\nmany reasons, do not wish to access public equity.\nIndustry funds are formed to invest in industries\nin which a high level of activity is anticipated and\nin which industry expertise is thought to be\nespecially important. Over the past several years\nsuch funds have been formed to invest in the\ninsurance and communications industries.50\nPrivate Equity Outstanding Today\nCumulative commitments to private equity\npartnerships over 1980-94 totaled $127 billion\n(chart 2). Of this total, $33 billion was committed\nto partnerships dedicated to venture capital\nfinancing while a much greater amount, $94 bil\nlion, was committed to partnerships dedicated to\nnon-venture investments.\nPrivate equity capital outstanding at year-end\n1994 was $100.4 billion.51 This amount is less\nthan cumulative commitments over 1980-94\nbecause some commitments made to partnerships\nhave been distributed back to investors.52 The\ndistribution of private equity holdings among\nmajor investor groups is described in chapter 5.\n48. See ''KKR, Forstmann Adapt Strategies to New Mar\nket,'' The Private Equity Analyst, March 1994.\n49. The Private Equity Analyst, December 1992.\n50. See ''Media Strategies Come Into Focus,'' The Private\nEquity Analyst, March 1995.\n51. Estimated private equity outstanding is at cost; details\nare provided in the appendix.\n52. Offsetting these distributions are direct investments made\nby some of the more experienced investors, such as bank-\naffiliated SBICs and venture capital subsidiaries of nonfinancial\ncorporations.\n\n3. Issuers in the Private Equity Market\nPrivate equity is one of the most expensive forms\nof finance. Thus, firms that raise private equity\ntend to be those that are unable to raise funds\nin other markets such as the bank loan, private\nplacement, or public equity market. Many of these\nfirms are simply too risky to be able to issue debt.\nAlso, investment in these firms may require a\nlarge amount of due diligence on the part of\npotential investors because little public information\nis available and because of the unique risks\ninvolved. The firms may also need investor guid\nance and expertise in developing their business.\nThe private equity market, where a large investor\ncan take the time and effort to understand pre\ncisely such risks and may exert some influence\nover management in return for its investment, may\nbe the only viable alternative for these firms.\nIn this chapter we present a taxonomy of firms\nthat issue in the private equity market based on\nsuch firm characteristics as age, size, and reason\nfor raising capital. Our characterizations of groups\nof issuers are based primarily on evidence from\ninterviews with market participants, because many\nfirms that issue private equity are private corpora\ntions for which data are largely unavailable. We\ndo, however, supplement the evidence from\ninterviews with information on two groups of\nfirms that issue private equity: firms that issued\nprivate equity before going public and firms that\nissue private equity through an agent.\nA Taxonomy of Issuers\nOur taxonomy lists the types of firm that issue\nprivate equity, their reasons for doing so, their\nmajor investors, and other characteristics (table 4).\nWe do not claim that our taxonomy is exhaustive\nor that there is no overlap between the groups, but\nwe do believe that the groups account for the bulk\nof the issuers of private equity and that the\ndifferences between groups are substantial enough\nto be meaningful.\nFirms Seeking Venture Capital\nThe industry has no standard terminology for\ndescribing the different firms in the venture capital\nmarket. Plummer (1987) and Sahlman (1990)\nidentify seven types of firms that seek venture\ncapital finance.53 However, our interviews with\nmarket participants did not reveal enough preci\nsion or consistency in the classification of firms\nto justify a breakdown into seven neat categories.\nMost market participants we talked to made a\ndistinction merely between ''early-stage'' and\n''later-stage'' venture capital. Early-stage new\nventures fit the conventional image of a firm\nseeking venture capital: They are firms that have\na substantial risk of failure because the technology\nbehind their production method or the logic behind\ntheir marketing approach has yet to be proved.\nLater-stage new ventures have a more proven\ntechnology behind their product and a more\nproven market for it; their risk comes less from\nuncertainties about the feasibility of their business\nconcepts than from the myriad uncertainties that\naffect all small businesses. The groups do have a\ncommon objective, however: to grow fast enough\nthat they will ultimately be able to go public or be\nsold to another company.\nEarly-Stage New Ventures\nEarly-stage firms vary somewhat in size, age, and\nreasons for seeking external capital. The smallest\ntype of venture in this category is the entrepreneur\nwho needs financing to conduct research and\ndevelopment to determine whether a business\nconcept deserves further financing.54 The concept\nmay involve a new technology or merely a new\nmarketing approach. Financing may be needed to\nbuild a prototype, conduct a market survey, or\nbring together a formal business plan and recruit\nmanagement.\nA somewhat more mature type of firm in the\nearly-stage category already has some evidence\nthat production on a commercial scale is feasible\nand that there is a market for the product. Such\nfirms need financing primarily to establish operat\ning companies, by setting up initial manufacturing\nand distribution capabilities, so they can sell their\nproduct on a commercial scale. Slightly more\n53. These seven types range from firms seeking ''seed''\ncapital to determine the feasibility of a business idea to firms\nnearly mature enough to be sold to another company or to\nissue equity in the public markets.\n54.

The most mature of the early-stage\nfirms are those that are starting to turn profits but\nwhose demand for working capital and capital for\nfurther expansion is rising faster than their cash\nflow.\nEarly-stage venture investments are by their\nnature small and illiquid. A typical early-stage\ninvestment might range from $500,000 to fund\nthe development of a prototype, for example, to\n$2 million to finance the start-up of an operating\ncompany. Investors in early-stage ventures recog\nnize that their investments are for the long term\nand that they may be unable to liquidate them for\nmany years, even if the venture is successful.\nBecause of their high risk and low liquidity,\nearly-stage venture investments carry high required\nreturns. The discount rate that investors apply to\nsuch investments may range as high as 35 percent\nto 70 percent per annum.55\n55. The discount rates cited here and later in this section are\nfrom Plummer (1987) and from interviews with market\nparticipants. The rates are used to convert an estimated termi\nnal value of the company after a certain period (say, five to\nseven years) to a present value. These discount rates may seem\nhigh compared with the actual returns reported by the venture\ncapital partnerships analyzed in chapter 7. The differences have\ntwo explanations. First, these discount rates are gross rates of\nreturn to the partnership, not to the limited partners, as dis\ncussed in chapter 7; returns to limited partners are gross\npartnership returns, less management fees and the general\npartners' carried interest. Second, as discussed in chapter 4,\nthese discount rates are required returns conditional on the\nsuccess of an investment rather than required unconditional\nexpected rates of return.\n\nEarly-stage new ventures obtain capital from\nearly-stage limited partnerships. Angel capital is\nalso important to this group of firms. As discussed\nin chapter 1, angel capital is provided somewhat\ninformally, usually at the very early stages of the\nfirm's development, by individuals who have high\nnet worth. The most mature early-stage firms may\nalso have access to bank finance to meet their\nliquidity needs, particularly if they are generating\na profit on existing operations and have some\ncollateral, such as inventories, receivables, or other\nfixed assets, that can be used to secure a loan.\nLater-Stage New Ventures\nFirms that need later-stage venture funds have less\nuncertainty associated with the feasibility of their\nbusiness concept. They have a proven technology\nand a proven market for their product. They are\ntypically growing fast and generating profits. Such\nfirms need private equity financing to add capacity\nor to update their equipment to sustain their fast\ngrowth. If the firms' original investors (manage\nment, or venture capital limited partnerships)\nneed liquidity before issuance of an IPO or sale\nto another company, such firms may also seek\nlater-stage private equity financing to support a\nlimited cash-out of the original investors or a\nrestructuring of positions among the venture\ncapital investors.\nGenerally, later-stage venture investments are\nlarger than early-stage investments, ranging from\n$2 million to $5 million, and are held for a shorter\nterm, simply because the firm is closer to being\nsold publicly or to another firm. Because the risk\nis generally lower and the liquidity higher, later-\nstage investments carry somewhat lower required\nreturns than early-stage investments. The discount\nrate used to convert an estimated terminal value to\na present value may be 25 percent to 40 percent.\nMiddle-Market Private Firms\nOver the 1980s, middle-market private firms found\nincreasing opportunities to raise private equity as\nthe market looked beyond pure venture capital\ninvestment. These firms differ in a number of\nways from firms seeking venture financing. First,\nthey are generally well established, having been\nfounded decades, rather than years or months,\nearlier. Second, with annual revenues ranging from\n$25 million to $500 million, they are typically\nmuch larger than early-stage new ventures and are\nin most cases larger than later-stage new ventures.\nThird, they are typically not in high technology\nsectors, but are more often than not in basic retail\nand manufacturing industries.56 Fourth, most have\nmuch more stable cash flows and much lower\ngrowth rates than firms seeking venture finance,\nand they are typically profitable, generating any\nwhere from $5 million to $25 million in annual\noperating earnings. Finally, they typically have a\nsignificant asset base to borrow against (such as\ninventories or receivables) and consequently\nalmost always have access to bank loans. Some\nof the larger firms in this category may also have\naccess to the private placement bond market.\nThese firms' reasons for seeking external equity\nfinancing are also quite different from those of\nfirms seeking venture capital. Many are family-\nowned enterprises that have no desire to go public.\nSuch firms generally seek private equity to achieve\none of two objectives: to effect a change in\nownership or capital structure, or to finance an\nexpansion (an acquisition of another firm or the\npurchase of additional plant and equipment).\nAlthough these firms typically have access to bank\nloans, or even to private placements, they often\ncannot meet their financing needs entirely through\nsuch debt instruments.\nChange in Ownership or Capital Structure. All\nfamily-owned and closely held private companies\neventually face the issue of succession of the\ncurrent management team or the liquidity needs of\nexisting owners. Resolution of the issue typically\nrequires that the company be sold to the heirs\nof the founding family or to a new management\nteam. In either case, funds must be available to\ncash out the existing owners. Typically, a private\nequity limited partnership organizes the financing\nof an ownership change, in many instances with\na combination of private equity and subordinated\ndebt. Depending on the proportions of debt and\nequity used, a change in capital structure (a lever\naged buyout) may accompany the ownership\nchange. The new owners typically are the heirs,\nthe new management, and the private equity\nlimited partnership that provided the financing.\nMarket participants have remarked that this reason\nfor tapping the private equity market has become\nmore common in recent years as the many private\nbusinesses that were started soon after World\nWar II require a change of ownership from the\nfounder to the heirs.\n56. Study by Pathway Capital Management, reported in\nVenture Capital Journal, June 1993, p. 7.\n\nExpansion by Acquisition or Purchase of New\nPlant. Middle-market firms that want to expand\ntheir plant and equipment or to acquire related\nbusinesses appear to be an important class of\nissuer in the private equity market. The wide\nspread move to consolidate a number of basic\nretail and manufacturing industries in the United\nStates over the past decade has contributed to such\nacquisition activity. Market participants point\nparticularly to the increasing tendency of large\nmanufacturers to reduce the number of suppliers\nas a spur to consolidation among small manufac\nturers of intermediate goods. In addition, the\npressure for large-scale consolidation in a number\nof end-product manufacturing industries has forced\nmany middle-market private firms to consider\nmaking acquisitions in order to survive.\nNon-venture partnerships are a major source of\nprivate equity for middle-market firms, although\npartnerships that specialize in later-stage ventures\nalso appear to finance such deals on a regular\nbasis. Just as the typical middle-market firm is\nsomewhat larger than a firm seeking venture\ncapital, the investments in middle-market firms\nare larger, typically ranging from $10 million to\n$100 million. Required returns are lower than for\nventure capital financing, reflecting the greater\nstability of the firms' cash flows and the busi\nnesses they are in. Discount rates for middle-\nmarket private equity investors may range from\n15 percent to 25 percent.\nFirms in Financial Distress\nPrivate and public firms that are in financial\ndistress make up another group of issuers in the\nprivate equity market.\nPrivate Firms\nFor private firms in financial distress, most private\nequity is supplied by specialized ''turnaround''\npartnerships that hope to restore the firm to\nprofitability and then sell it. Reflecting this\nspecialization, most limited partnerships that\nprovide private equity to distressed firms do not\nalso invest in venture firms or in other middle-\nmarket firms. Most turnaround partnerships target\nprivate firms that have already triggered a default\nprovision on their outstanding loans. Firms are\ntypically in the manufacturing or distribution\nsector and have annual sales of $25 million to\n$200 million. In addition, most turnaround\npartnerships target firms with financial problems\nthat arose simply from being overleveraged--that\nis, they show positive earnings before interest and\ntaxes (EBIT); a smaller number also invest in\nfirms with definable operating and management\nproblems that are showing negative EBIT.\nIn return for its injection of new capital, the\nturnaround partnership usually receives controlling\ninterest in the firm, with the former owners and\ncurrent management making up the minority\ninterest. The firm renegotiates terms with existing\nlenders, offering to restructure or pay off loans at\na discount. Typically the firm's postacquisition\ndebt-to-equity ratio ranges between 1 and 3. The\nturnaround partnership then uses its expertise to\nfind new markets for the firm's product and to\nadvise on cost cutting. If the firm's financial\nproblems are due to current management rather\nthan capital structure, new management is\nbrought in.\nRequired returns are high, reflecting the risky\nnature of the activity, and discount rates vary from\nperhaps 30 percent to 35 percent.\nPublic Firms\nPublic firms in financial distress are unlikely to\nbe able to issue public equity except at a large\ndiscount, and they are typically shut out of the\ndebt markets (the bank loan, private placement,\nand public bond markets). For these firms the\neasiest course may be to persuade a large investor\nwho has the time and resources to understand the\nrisks to make a substantial private equity invest\nment. In return, the investor may be given some\ncontrol or influence over the direction of the firm.\nPublic Buyouts\nAlong with venture capital, buyouts of public\nfirms are probably the most familiar, most publi\ncized uses of private equity. This familiarity stems\nfrom the surge in leveraged buyout (LBO) activity\nin the 1980s. Whereas in the 1970s a few large\ninsurance companies invested in small LBOs, in\nthe mid-1980s limited partnerships managed by\nfirms specializing in LBOs became major inves\ntors, and both transaction size and the amount of\nleverage employed increased dramatically. In\n1988, for example, the total value of the 214 buy\nouts of public companies and divisions exceeded\n\n$77 billion--nearly one-third the value of all\nmergers and acquisitions in that year. In 1978, in\ncontrast, total LBO activity was less than $1 bil-\nlion.57\nCompanies that have undergone public buyouts\ntypically have moderate or even slow growth\nrates, stable cash flows, and management that was\nmisusing the discretionary cash flows for negative\npresent value acquisitions or other activities. Opler\nand Titman (1993), for example, found that firms\nthat have undergone LBOs tend to have less-\nfavorable growth opportunities and higher levels\nof cash flow than firms that have not undergone\nLBOs. After an LBO, the need to pay out large\namounts of cash to debtholders reduces the ability\nof management to misuse firm assets and results in\nan increase in firm value.\nOther Public Firms\nA number of public firms that issue equity in the\nprivate market apparently are not in financial\ndistress. Their reasons for issuing in the private\nmarket seem to be many and varied. One is cost:\nSome public firms are issuing very small amounts\nof equity (less than $5 million), and the all-in cost\nof such small issues may be less in the private\nmarket than in the public market.58 Other public\nfirms are raising funds to finance activities, such\nas planned acquisitions, that they want to keep\nconfidential. Also, some are planning merger or\nacquisition activity involving complex business\nstrategies that public retail investors would not be\ncomfortable with and that require analysis by a\nlarge, sophisticated private investor. Other firms\nissue in the private market because it is conve\nnient: Funds can usually be raised more quickly\nand with less paperwork than in the public market.\nA final reason that some public firms issue in\nthe private equity market is a temporary interrup\ntion of access to the public equity market. Market\nparticipants attribute such interruptions to the\nsusceptibility of retail and institutional investors to\na herd mentality in viewing the prospects of\nparticular industrial sectors or even the entire\nmarket. For example, companies that service oil\n57. See Jensen (1989). Of course, these numbers measure\nthe total value of the companies and divisions purchased in\nLBOs, not the amount of private equity used to finance the\npurchase, which was typically a small fraction of the total\npurchased value.\n58. Although they may get a lower price for their shares in\nthe private market, these firms are not burdened with the large\nfixed costs involved in a public market issuance.\nfields found it almost impossible to issue equity\npublicly in 1989. Banks faced similar conditions\nin 1991, and cable television companies in 1992.\nMany firms in these industries would have been\nforced to turn to the private market to meet their\nneeds.\nEmpirical Examination of Issuers\nof Private Equity\nIn this section we provide some empirical infor\nmation on two types of firms that issue private\nequity: public firms that received private equity\nfinancing before going public, and firms that issue\nprivate equity through agents.\nIPO Firms that Received\nPrivate Equity Backing\nTo examine IPO firms that received private equity\nbacking before going public, we first identified\nfirms that had made initial public offerings of at\nleast $1.5 million in 1991-93 listed in Security\nData Company's (SDC) database of public equity\nissues. We then identified from that group two sets\nof firms: one set that had received venture financ\ning (identified using Venture Capital Journal's list\nof IPO firms that had previously received institu\ntional venture capital) and another set that had\npreviously gone private in an LBO.59 For each\nfirm we collected balance sheet and income data\nfrom COMPUSTAT for the quarter just before the\nfirm went public. COMPUSTAT data were\navailable for 346 venture-backed firms and\n125 reverse-LBO firms.\nVenture-Backed New Firms\nThe 346 firms that had received venture financing\nare not representative of all firms that access\nventure capital. They are only the ''success\nstories''--those venture-backed firms that suc\nceeded in growing fast enough to make an IPO\npossible.60 Indeed, they are only a portion of the\n59. The latter set of firms satisfied two criteria: They were\nidentified in the SDC database as reverse-LBOs, and they were\nidentified by Moody's Investor Service as public firms taken\nprivate.\n60. Firms that go public likely represent a small fraction of\nall firms that receive seed and early-stage financing, as the\nsuccess rate of these investments is estimated to be only\n10 percent to 30 percent.\n\n5. Distribution of new venture-backed and\nVenture-backed firms also appear to have higher\nnot-venture-backed IPO firms, by industry,\nratios of research and development expenditures to\n1991-931\nassets, and to have lower ratios of debt to assets\nIndustry\nVenture-\nbacked\nNot-venture-\nbacked\nNumber Percent Number Percent\nComputer-related .......\nSoftware ..............\nHardware .............\nMedical and health .....\nBiotechnology ........\nMedical instruments . .\nHealth services .......\nManufacturing (not\ncomputer-related) . .\nRetail and wholesale ....\nTelecommunications ....\nOther business services .\nOther ....................\nTotal ....................\n1.

Of the\n635 portfolio companies that venture capitalists\nexited successfully in 1991-93, merger and\nacquisition transactions accounted for 191 deals\nand IPOs for 444 deals.61\nTable 5 shows the distribution of new IPO firms\nin 1991-93 by industry--the 346 venture-backed\nfirms and 440 new firms that had not received\nventure backing. The venture-backed firms were\nconcentrated in very different industries than the\nnew firms that had not received venture backing.\nApproximately 65 percent of venture-backed firms\nwere in the computer-related and medical and\nhealth sectors (particularly the biotechnology\nindustry), compared with only 26 percent of the\nfirms without previous venture backing. The not-\nventure-backed firms were especially concentrated\nin the manufacturing and retail and wholesale\nsectors. Consistent with our characterization, the\nventure-backed new firms tend to be concentrated\nin technology and research-intensive activities.\n61. Venture Capital Journal, April 1995. Over a longer\nperiod, 1983-94, mergers and acquisitions of venture-backed\nfirms accounted for half of all exits, 1,104 out of a total of\n2,200.\nand fixed assets to total assets, consistent with\ntheir technology-intensive orientation (table 6).\nFurther, despite being smaller, venture-backed\nfirms raised considerably more capital through the\nIPO. The greater proceeds could be indicative of\nthese firms' higher growth potential.\nThe differences in firm size indicated by the\ndata in table 6 are due largely to differences in\nindustry concentration. Table 7 presents data on\nthe financial characteristics of firms in the five\nindustry sectors that make up the computer and\nmedical-related categories. Biotechnology and\nmedical instruments firms, which together\naccounted for 29 percent of venture-backed new\nIPO firms in 1991-93, typically had assets of only\nabout $8 million just before going public and\nalmost no sales. These firms are considerably\nsmaller than the typical IPO firm and bring down\nthe size of the typical venture-backed firm. Other\nimportant distinctions remain after holding\nindustry sector constant--namely, venture-backed\n6.

The amount raised by the\nmedian reverse-LBO firm through the IPO,\n$49 million, is about 25 percent of total assets,\nquite modest compared with the ratio of IPO\nproceeds to total assets for venture-backed new\nfirms, which in many cases exceeds 100 percent.\nThe lower proportion of proceeds relative to assets\nlikely is a reflection of the most common use of\nproceeds from IPO: Reverse-LBO firms often use\nthem to reduce debt, whereas new firms use them\nto fund growth.\nFirms that Issue Agented Private Equity\nData on firms that use agents to issue private\nequity were obtained from Securities Data\nCompany (SDC), which bases its data on reports\nsubmitted by agents.

Agent-assisted private equity issues,\nFor the eighty-nine public firms that used agents\nto issue private equity, we have balance sheet and\nincome statement data from COMPUSTAT.

One such characteristic was financial\ndistress. We classified a firm as being in financial\ndistress if it reported an interest coverage ratio of\nless than 1 in the year it made a private equity\nissue.64 Forty-six of the eighty-nine firms satisfied\nthis criterion, suggesting that more than half were\nin financial distress at the time they issued private\nequity. These firms likely were forced to raise\nfunds privately because their financial condition\nmade it impossible, or very costly, to issue public\nequity.\nWhat motivated the forty-three firms not in\nfinancial distress to issue equity privately? One\nfactor may have been the size of their issues, ten\nof which were for $5 millon or less. These firms\nmay have found it less costly to issue in the\nprivate market; though they may have gotten a\nlower price for their small issues, they avoided the\nhigher fixed costs associated with the public\nmarket. Another factor prompting these firms to\nissue private equity may have been a desire for\nprivacy: They did not have to reveal private\ninformation or business plans, as they would have\nwith a public issue. Six firms had sought funds\nspecifically to finance a planned acquisition.\nWhy the remaining twenty-seven firms issued\nequity privately instead of publicly is not clear.\nSome, of course, may have been in financial\ndistress or wanted to protect the confidentiality of\ntheir business in ways not discerned by our simple\nmeasures. For other firms, special legal or regula\ntory circumstances may have prompted them to\nissue privately.\n63. Mean asset size was considerably larger, $3.8 billion,\nbecause one public firm that issued private equity during the\nperiod, Chrysler Financial Corporation, had assets ($213 bil\nlion) an order of magnitude larger than the next largest firm in\nthe sample.\n64.

Intermediaries in the Private Equity Market:\nThe Role of Partnerships\nAccompanying the growth of the private equity\nmarket in the 1980s was the rise of professionally\nmanaged limited partnerships as intermediaries. In\ncertain respects, the success of limited partnerships\nis paradoxical. Interests in such partnerships are\nilliquid over the partnership's life, which in some\ncases runs more than ten years. During the period,\ninvestors have little control over the way their\nfunds are managed. At the same time, partnership\nmanagement fees and performance-based compen\nsation raise the cost of private equity to issuers\nabove the already high rates of return required by\ninvestors as compensation for risk and illiquidity.\nNevertheless, the increasing dominance of limited\npartnerships suggests that they benefit both\ninvestors and issuers.\nIn this chapter we examine the organizational\nstructure of partnerships and the ways in which\nthey permit the private equity market to function\nmore efficiently. We begin by discussing the\nreasons some form of specialized intermediary is\nindispensable to the private equity market. Next\nwe examine the reasons limited partnerships are an\nespecially effective form of intermediary: We look\nat the ways general partners manage the sorting\nand incentive problems that arise between them\nselves and the managers of their portfolio compa\nnies, and then describe the special organizational\nand contractual features of private equity partner\nships and the means of aligning the interests of the\nlimited and general partners. We conclude the\nchapter by examining the role of direct invest\nments in the private equity market.65\nRationale for Intermediation\nin the Private Equity Market\nUntil the late 1970s, private equity investments\nwere undertaken mainly by wealthy families,\n65. Our discussion closely follows Sahlman's (1990) but\ndiffers in several respects. First, we emphasize the adaptability\nof the limited partnership structure to all segments of the\nprivate equity market, venture and non-venture capital alike.\nSecond, we place greater emphasis on the role of reputation in\nthe private equity market. In emphasizing the role of reputation\nand the importance of establishing a favorable track record,\nwe also focus on the problems of performance measurement.\nFinally, we emphasize that private equity partnerships remain\na relatively recent development and that the terms of the\npartnerships--especially those pertaining to general partner\ncompensation--continue to evolve. Here we are able to benefit\nfrom recent research in this area, especially that by Gompers\nand Lerner (1994a, 1994b, 1995).\nfinancial institutions, and industrial corporations\ninvesting directly in the securities of issuing firms.\nToday, about 80 percent of private equity invest\nments flow through specialized intermediaries,\nalmost all of which are in the form of limited\npartnerships.66 Before describing the specific\nadvantages of this organizational form, we discuss\nthe reasons intermediaries are used at all in the\nprivate equity market.\nTwo types of problems frequently arise when\noutsiders finance the investment activity of a\nfirm--sorting problems and incentive problems.\nSorting problems arise in the course of selecting\ninvestments: Firm owners and managers typically\nknow much more about the condition of their\nbusiness than outsiders, and it is in their interest\nto accent the positive while downplaying potential\ndifficulties. Sorting problems and their implica\ntions for corporate finance were first analyzed by\nLeland and Pyle (1977) and Ross (1977). Their\npapers stress that firms minimize their information\nadvantage by issuing debt; higher-quality firms\nrely more heavily on debt than on equity for\nexternal financing.\nIncentive problems arise in the course of the\nfirm's operations. Firm managers have many\nopportunities to take actions that benefit them\nselves at the expense of outside investors. In\ntheir pioneering treatment of this issue, Jensen\nand Meckling (1976) stress that a combination\nof methods is usually needed to align the\nincentives of firm managers and investors; these\nmethods include the selection of an appropriate\ncapital structure, the use of collateral and secu\nrity covenants, and direct monitoring. Diamond\n(1991) highlights the role of reputation in miti\ngating incentive problems. However, these and\nmany subsequent studies view debt as central\nto providing incentives to those who control\nbusinesses.\nFinancing situations in which private equity is\nused are those in which the sorting and incentive\nproblems are especially severe and in which\n66. As explained in chapter 1, we treat the direct private\nequity investments of bank-affiliated SBICs (Small Business\nInvestment Companies) and venture capital subsidiaries of\nnonfinancial companies as direct investments rather than as\ninvestments by non-partnership intermediaries. That is how we\narrive at the statement that almost all intermediated private\nequity finance now flows through limited partnerships.\n\nissuance of debt is impractical.67 Resolving the\nextensive sorting and incentive problems in such\nsituations requires that investors engage in\nintensive pre-investment due diligence and post-\ninvestment monitoring. These activities are not\nefficiently performed by large numbers of inves\ntors; there can be too much of both types of\nactivities because investors duplicate each others'\nwork, or too little of each owing to the tendency\nof investors to free-ride on the efforts of others.\nThus, delegating these activities to a single\nintermediary is potentially efficient.\nThe efficiency of intermediation depends on\nhow effectively the sorting and incentive problems\nbetween investors and intermediaries can be\nresolved.68 In the private equity market, reputation\nplays a key role in addressing these problems\nbecause the market is composed of a small\nnumber of actors that interact with each other\nrepeatedly. For example, partnership managers\nthat fail to establish a favorable track record\nmay subsequently be unable to raise funds or\nparticipate in investment syndicates with other\npartnerships.\nThe importance of delegated monitoring in\nexplaining the emergence of private equity\nintermediaries is suggested by the remarks of an\ninsurance company executive who had managed a\nsmall direct private equity portfolio in the 1960s.\nBy 1982, the company was investing exclusively\nthrough limited partnerships. The company official\nexplained: ''The results [of direct investing] were\nnot bad at all when the returns were in . . . [but\nwe were] annoyed by the amount of time every\nbody ended up spending on little companies. We\nwere persuaded that [direct] venture investing is\ninherently awkward.'' 69\nIntermediaries are also important because\nselecting, structuring, and managing private equity\ninvestments requires considerable expertise.\n67. Firms that need venture capital, for example, have no\ncash flow, few physical assets to serve as collateral, and little\ncapital in the form of reputation. Any debt issued by such firms\nwould be extremely difficult to price owing to the riskiness of\nthe firm's activities and uncertainty among investors about how\ngreat the true level of risk was. Middle-market firms encounter\nsimilar difficulties: They have either exceeded their debt\ncapacity or are undertaking an expansion that is too risky, or\nwhose risks are too uncertain, to finance with debt. Firms that\nare undergoing leveraged buyouts have already taken on a\nlarge debt load.\n68. If, for example, investors must investigate the intermedi\nary to the same extent that they would investigate the invest\nments that the intermediary makes on their behalf, using an\nintermediary may be less efficient rather than more efficient\n(see Diamond, 1984).\n69. See Thomas P. Murphy, ''The Odd Couple,'' Forbes,\nApril 26, 1982.\nGaining such expertise requires a critical mass of\ninvestment activity that most institutional investors\ncannot attain on their own. Managers of private\nequity intermediaries are able to acquire such\nexpertise through exposure to and participation in\na large number of investment opportunities. They\nrefine their skills through specialization--focusing\non companies in specific industries and at specific\nstages of business development. Although institu\ntional investors could also specialize in this way,\nthey would lose the benefits of diversification.\nFinally, intermediaries play an important role\nin furnishing business expertise to the firms they\ninvest in. Reputation, learning, and specialization\nall enhance an intermediary's ability to provide\nthese services. For example, a reputation for\ninvesting in well-managed firms is valuable in\nobtaining the services of underwriters. Likewise,\nspecialization allows an intermediary to more\neffectively assist its portfolio companies in hiring\npersonnel, dealing with suppliers, and carrying out\nother operations-related activities.\nOverview of Private Equity Partnerships\nPrivate equity partnerships are limited partnerships\nin which the senior managers of a partnership\nmanagement firm serve as the general partners and\ninstitutional investors are the limited partners.70\nWell-known management firms include Kleiner,\nPerkins, Caufield, and Byers, a traditional venture\ncapital firm, and Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts, a\nbuyout group. The general partners are responsible\nfor managing the partnership's investments and\ncontributing a very small proportion of the\npartnership's capital (most often, 1 percent); the\nlimited partners provide the balance of the\ninvestment funds.\n70. For tax and liability reasons, the actual arrangement is\nmore complicated. Typically, a second limited partnership\nserves as the general partner of the private equity limited\npartnership. The partnership management firm is the general\npartner of the second partnership, and the senior managers of\nthe partnership management firm are the limited partners of the\nsecond partnership.\nThe senior managers of the partnership management firm are\noften referred to as ''general partners'' of the private equity\npartnership, even though in a legal sense they are employees\nof the partnership management firm and limited partners of the\nsecond partnership. As employees of the partnership manage\nment firm, they manage the private equity partnership; as\nlimited partners of the second partnership, they provide the\ngeneral partner's share of capital to the private equity partner\nship and receive the general partner's share of profits. Through\nout this study we adopt the convention of referring to these\nsenior managers as general partners.\n\nEach partnership has a contractually fixed\nlifetime, generally ten years, with provisions to\nextend the partnership, usually in one- or two-year\nincrements up to a maximum of four years.\nDuring the first three to five years the partner-\nship's capital is invested. Thereafter, the invest\nments are managed and gradually liquidated. As\nthe investments are liquidated, distributions are\nmade to the limited partners in the form of cash\nor securities. The partnership managers typically\nraise a new partnership fund at about the time the\ninvestment phase for an existing partnership has\nbeen completed. Thus, the managers are raising\nnew partnership funds approximately every three\nto five years and at any one time may be manag\ning several funds, each in a different phase of its\nlife. Each partnership is legally separate, however,\nand is managed independently of the others.\nPrivate equity partnerships vary greatly both in\nthe total amount invested and in the number of\nlimited partners. Some early-stage venture capital\npartnerships and regionally focused non-venture\npartnerships are as small as $10 million. At the\nother extreme, some leveraged buyout partnerships\nare as large as $1 billion or more. A partnership\ntypically invests in ten to fifty portfolio companies\n(two to fifteen companies a year) during its three-\nto five-year investment phase. The number of\nlimited partners is not fixed: Most private equity\npartnerships have ten to thirty, though some have\nas few as one and others more than fifty.71 The\nminimum commitment is typically $1 million, but\npartnerships that cater to wealthy individuals may\nhave a lower minimum and larger partnerships\nmay have a $10 million to $20 million minimum.\nMost partnership management firms have six to\ntwelve senior managers who serve as general\npartners, although many new firms are started by\ntwo or three general partners and a few large firms\nhave twenty or more. Partnership management\nfirms also employ associates--general partners in\ntraining--usually in the ratio of one associate to\nevery one or two general partners. Many private\nequity professionals argue that an apprenticeship is\nessential to success as a general partner. However,\ngeneral partners also have backgrounds as entre\npreneurs and senior managers in industries in\nwhich private equity partnerships invest and, to\na lesser extent, in investment and commercial\n71. Many partnerships that have a single limited partner\nhave been initiated and organized by the limited partner rather\nthan by the general partner. Such limited partners are in many\ncases nonfinancial corporations that want to invest for strategic\nas well as financial reasons--a corporation that wants exposure\nto emerging technologies in its field, for example.\nbanking. A partnership management firm evolves\nas associates are promoted, younger general\npartners split off to form their own firms, and the\nmore senior general partners retire.\nRelationship between a Partnership\nand its Portfolio Companies\nA partnership's investment activities are divided\ninto four stages. The first is selecting investments,\nwhich includes obtaining access to high-quality\ndeals and evaluating potential investments. This\nstage involves the acquisition of a large amount of\ninformation and the sorting and evaluation of the\ninformation. The second stage is structuring\ninvestments. ''Investment structure'' refers to the\ntype and number of securities issued as equity by\nthe portfolio company and to other substantive\nprovisions of investment agreements. These\nprovisions affect both managerial incentives at\nportfolio companies and the partnership's ability to\ninfluence a company's operations. The third stage,\nmonitoring investments, involves active participa\ntion in the management of portfolio companies.\nThrough membership on boards of directors and\nless formal channels, general partners exercise\ncontrol and furnish the portfolio companies with\nfinancial, operating, and marketing expertise as\nneeded. The fourth stage is exiting investments,\nwhich involves taking portfolio companies public\nor selling them privately. Because partnerships\nhave finite lives and investors expect repayment\nin cash or marketable securities, an exit strategy\nis an integral part of the investment process.\nSelecting Investments\nAccess to information about high-quality invest\nment opportunities--deal flow--is crucial to a\nprivate equity partnership. General partners rely\non relationships with investment bankers, brokers,\nconsultants, lawyers, and accountants to obtain\nleads; they also count on referrals from firms they\nsuccessfully financed in the past. Economies of\nscale apparently play an important role in deal\nflow: The larger the number of investments a\npartnership is involved in, the larger the number\nof investment opportunities it is exposed to.\nPartnerships compete directly with agents to\nlocate candidate firms. Deals brought to partner\nships by agents are less attractive than deals\npartnerships locate themselves because agent-\narranged deals involve additional fees and tend\n\nto get bid up in price by competing investors.72\nNonetheless, a portion of partnership investments\nare generated by agents (see chapter 6).\nDue Diligence\nPartnership managers receive hundreds of invest\nment proposals. To be successful, they must be\nable to select efficiently the approximately 1 per\ncent of these proposals that they invest in each\nyear.73 Efficient selection is properly regarded as\nmore art than science and depends on the acumen\nof the general partners acquired through experi\nence operating businesses as well as experience\nin the private equity field.\nInvestment proposals are first screened to\neliminate those that are unpromising or that fail to\nmeet the partnership's investment criteria. Private\nequity partnerships typically specialize by type of\ninvestment as well as by industry and location of\nthe investment.74 Specialization reduces the\nnumber of investment opportunities considered and\nalso reflects the degree of specialized knowledge\nrequired to make successful investment decisions.\nThis initial review takes only a few hours and\nresults in the rejection of up to 90 percent of the\nproposals a partnership receives. In many cases,\nthe remaining proposals are subjected to a second\nreview, which may take several days. Critical\ninformation included in the investment proposal is\nverified and the major assumptions of the business\nplan are scrutinized. As many as half the propos\nals that survived the initial screening are rejected\nat this stage.\nProposals that survive these preliminary reviews\nbecome the subject of a more comprehensive due\ndiligence process that can last up to six weeks.\nThis phase includes visits to the firm; meetings\nand telephone discussions with key employees,\ncustomers, suppliers, and creditors; and the\n72. There is a general perception among partnerships that\nthe winning bid on an agent-placed deal suffers ''the winner's\ncurse.''\n73. Silver (1985) suggests that venture capital firms invest in\none deal for every one hundred business plans they receive.\nOur discussions with fund managers indicate that this ratio is\nequally valid for non-venture partnerships. Interestingly, the\nratio was roughly the same for the first organized private\nequity firm, American Research and Development Corporation\n(ARD). In its first four years (1946-49), ARD received 3,000\napplications for financial assistance. Half were eliminated in\nthe course of a preliminary review, the remaining 1,500 were\nexamined in detail, and 16 were eventually funded (Schmidt,\n1951).\n74. Types of investments include early- and later-stage\nventure capital and the entire range of non-venture private\nequity.\nretention of outside lawyers, accountants, and\nindustry consultants. For proposals that involve\nnew ventures, the main concerns are the quality of\nthe firm's management and the economic viability\nof the firm's product or service (see Premus, 1984;\nSilver, 1985; and Gladstone, 1988). For proposals\ninvolving established firms, the general objective\nis to gain a thorough understanding of the existing\nbusiness. The precise focus of the investigation,\nhowever, varies with the type of investment: In the\ncase of distressed companies, efforts are focused\non discussions with the company's lenders; in the\ncase of a buyouts of family-owned businesses,\nmanagement succession issues warrant greater\nattention; and in the case of highly leveraged\nacquisitions, efforts focus on developing detailed\ncash flow projections.\nExtensive due diligence in the private equity\nmarket is needed because little, if any, information\nabout issuers is publicly available and in most\ncases the partnership has had no relationship with\nthe issuer. Thus, the partnership must rely heavily\non information that it is able to produce de novo.\nMoreover, managers of the issuing firm typically\nknow more than outsiders about many aspects of\ntheir business. This information asymmetry,\ncombined with the fact that issuing private equity\nis very expensive, has the potential to create\nsevere adverse selection problems for investors.76\nIn the private equity market, the problem of\nadverse selection is mitigated by the extensive\namount of due diligence conducted and by the fact\nthat alternative sources of finance for private\nequity issuers are limited.\nSyndication\nThough partnerships compete intensely to locate\npotential investment opportunities, they also\n75. Due diligence is more extensive in the private equity\nmarket than in either the public securities or private placement\ndebt market, in part because the information problems are more\nsevere. Also, due diligence in the private equity market is\nperformed by those who have a direct stake in the outcome of\nthe investment: the private equity partnership. By contrast, due\ndiligence in the public securities market is performed by the\nunderwriter. In the private placement debt market, due dili\ngence is performed by the issuer's agent or financial adviser\nin the course of preparing the offering memorandum; potential\ninvestors then perform due diligence of a more limited sort,\nessentially verifying the information furnished by the agent\n(see Carey and others, 1993).\n76. Adverse selection problems arise when investors\nsystematically invest in companies that have undisclosed\nproblems and risks because ''better'' companies either obtain\nless-expensive financing elsewhere or forgo financing\naltogether.\n\ncooperate with one another, most often through\nsyndication.77 The most common reasons for\nsyndication are deal size and location. Partnerships\nteam up to finance larger deals because of restric\ntions on the percentage of a partnership fund that\nmay be invested in a single deal. The geographic\nrationale for syndication is related to the value of\nlocal monitoring. A third, less common, reason for\nsyndication is that it permits the validation of one\npartnership's judgment by another. Finally, by\nallowing other partnerships to participate in its\ndeals, a partnership informally obliges others to\nreturn the favor in the future, thereby increasing\nits access to profitable deals.\nWhen deals are syndicated, the lead investor--\ngenerally the partnership that finds and initiates\nthe deal--structures the deal and performs the\nlion's share of the due diligence. In return, it can\nset terms and conditions that more closely meet\nits needs, although it rarely gets preferential terms.\nIt appears that because of their size, the majority\nof later-stage venture capital and middle-market\nbuyout investments are syndicated. Conversely,\nearly-stage new ventures are more likely to be\nfinanced entirely by a single partnership, reflecting\nnot only the more manageable size of early-stage\ninvestments but also the greater value of the\nservices performed by the lead investor.78 The\nlargest buyouts also tend to involve a single\ninvestor, a mega-buyout fund; the managers of\nthese funds appear to be less collaborative and less\nwilling to share information than the managers of\nother types of funds, and the funds are large\nenough to finance large deals entirely by them\nselves. There may also be a secular trend at work:\nAs the size of new partnership funds has grown\nover time, reliance on syndication apparently has\ndiminished.\nStructuring Investments\nIf after due diligence the partnership remains\ninterested in investing in a firm, the partnership\nand the firm begin negotiating an investment\nagreement setting forth the financial and gover\n77. To a lesser extent, partnerships refer deals to each other\nwhen an attractive investment opportunity located by one\npartnership does not meet its investment criteria.\n78. Nonetheless, Lerner (1994a) reports that the average\nnumber of venture capitalists participating in first-round\nfinancings of biotechnology firms during 1978-89 was more\nthan two, suggesting that a significant percentage of early-stage\ninvestments are syndicated. Lerner does not report the percent\nage, however.\nnance aspects of the deal. The main financial issue\nis the amount of ownership the partnership will\nacquire; two main governance issues are manage\nrial incentives at the portfolio company and the\npartnership's ability to exert control over the\ncompany, especially in the event that its perfor\nmance suffers.\nThe Partnership's Ownership Stake\nThe partnership's ownership share is determined in\nessentially the same manner regardless of the type\nof equity issued--by projecting the company's\nvalue on some future date and backing out the\npercent ownership that provides the partnership\nwith its required rate of return.79 The value is\ntypically based on multiples of projected after-tax\nearnings, earnings before interest and taxes, or\ncash-flow. Required rates of return vary by\ninvestment type: Venture capital partnerships\nreport required returns of 50 percent on early-\nstage investments and 25 percent on later-stage\ninvestments, whereas required returns on most\nnon-venture investments are in the range of\n15 percent to 25 percent. Because riskier invest\nments generally require more attention and\nmonitoring, their higher required rates of return\nreflect both a risk premium and compensation for\nthe general partners' time and effort.\n''Required'' rates of return on private equity\ninvestments of 15 percent to 50 percent are much\nhigher than average partnership returns, which are\nin the mid-teens (see chapter 7). The discrepancy\nsuggests that partnerships consistently fail to earn\ntheir required rates of return or that private equity\nis systematically overpriced. The more likely\nexplanation is that the ''required'' rate of return is\nthe return the partnership expects to earn if the\ninvestment is a success.80 In other words, it is a\nconditional expected return.\nThis conditional expected return approach to\npricing deals reflects the fact that returns on\nprivate equity investments are highly skewed:\nMore than half of all investments produce below-\naverage returns, and a small number of invest\nments yield extraordinarily high returns that raise\n79. The three principal types of private equity securities are\ncommon stock, convertible preferred stock, and subordinated\ndebt with conversion privileges or warrants. For pricing\npurposes, it is generally assumed that the conversion privilege\nor warrants will be exercised.\n80. This possibility is suggested by Kenneth Froot in Baty\nand others (1992).\n\nthe average.81 Under such a distribution of\noutcomes, the investment's return if it is a success\nwill largely determine its unconditional expected\nrate of return. It is therefore natural for a partner\nship and an issuing firm to focus on a conditional\nreturn in pricing a deal.\nNot surprisingly, agreeing on the future value\nof the firm is difficult. It is in the firm's interest to\nproject a high future value, as a high future value\nmeans that the firm will have to give less stock to\nthe partnership. On the other hand, it is in the\npartnership's interest to adopt a more conservative\nforecast. This conflict is often resolved by offering\nthe firm's managers the opportunity to increase\ntheir share holdings if certain performance objec\ntives are met (see next section). Besides address\ning what may be genuine differences of opinion,\nsuch an approach may also prompt firm managers\nto present a more realistic view of the firm's\nfuture earnings potential and provides strong\nperformance incentives.82\nManagerial Incentives\nInformation asymmetries between investors and\nmanagers of the issuing firm give rise to a poten\ntial ''moral hazard,'' whereby management pursues\nits own interests at the expense of investors. Pri\nvate equity partnerships rely on various mecha\nnisms to align the interests of managers and\ninvestors, including the level of managerial stock\nownership, the type of private equity issued to\ninvestors, and the terms of management employ\nment contracts.\nManagerial Stock Ownership. Unlike the situation\nat many public corporations, senior managers of\ncompanies in which private equity partnerships\ninvest typically own a significant share of their\ncompany's stock, and stock ownership in many\ncases accounts for a large part of managers' total\n81. Sahlman (1990) reports the results of one survey of\nportfolio returns for venture capital investments showing that\n34.5 percent of invested capital resulted in a loss and another\n30 percent resulted in returns in the low to middle single\ndigits. Conversely, less than 7 percent of invested capital\nresulted in payoffs of more than ten times the original amount\ninvested, and the payoff on these investments accounted for\nmore than 50 percent of the total ending value of all the\ninvestments.\n82. Another response to overvaluation of the firm by firm\ninsiders is to raise the required rate of return on the investment\n(see Sahlman, 1990).\ncompensation.83 A common provision in both\nventure and non-venture financing is an equity\n''earn-out'' (see Golder, 1983). This arrangement\nallows management to increase its ownership share\n(at the expense of investors) if certain performance\nobjectives are met. Performance objectives can be\nstated in terms of earnings, the market value of\nthe firm, or a combination of the two.\nType of Equity Issued to Investors. Convertible\npreferred stock is the type of private equity\nsecurity most frequently issued to investors. The\nmajor difference between convertible preferred\nstock and common stock is that holders of pre\nferred stock are paid before holders of common\nstock in the event of liquidation. From the partner-\nship's standpoint, the issuance of preferred stock\noffers two advantages. First, it reduces the partner-\nship's investment risk. Second, and more impor\ntant, it provides strong performance incentives to\nthe company's management, because management\ntypically holds common stock, or warrants to\npurchase common stock; if the company is only\nmarginally successful, its common stock will be\nworth relatively little. Subordinated debt with\nconversion privileges or warrants also provides\na liquidation preference to investors, and thus a\nperformance incentive to management.84\nManagement Employment Contracts. In principle,\nmanagement's equity position in the firm could\ninduce excessive risk-taking. However, manage\nment compensation can be structured to include\nprovisions that penalize poor performance, thereby\noffsetting incentives for risk-taking. Such provi\nsions often take the form of employment contracts\nthat specify conditions under which management\ncan be replaced and buyback provisions that allow\nthe firm to repurchase a manager's shares in the\nevent that he or she is replaced.\n83. Few data are available on managerial share ownership.\nWith venture capital, the share varies widely depending on\nmanagement's financial resources, the company's financing\nneeds, and the company's projected future value. It also\ndepends on the number of rounds of financing, as the share\ntypically is diluted with each round. Even in later-stage\ncompanies, however, management ownership of 20 percent\nis not unusual. For non-venture companies, managerial share\nownership in many cases is between 10 percent and 20 percent.\n84. In addition to eliciting managerial effort, convertible\npreferred and convertible debt can also mitigate excessive risk\ntaking (see Gompers, 1993).\n\nMechanisms of Control\nAlthough managerial incentives are an important\nmeans of aligning the interests of management and\ninvestors, a private equity partnership also relies\non its ability to exercise control over the firm in\norder to protects its interests. Mechanisms of con\ntrol include the general partners' representation on\nthe firm's board of directors, the allocation of\nvoting rights, and control of access to additional\nfinancing.\nBoard Representation. General partners can be\nextremely influential and effective outside direc\ntors. As large shareholders, they have an incentive\nto incur the expense necessary to monitor the firm.\nMoreover, they have the resources to be effective\nmonitors--their own staff members, information\nacquired during the due diligence process, and\nexpertise acquired while monitoring similar\ncompanies.\nPrivate equity partnerships in many cases\ndominate the boards of their portfolio companies.\nLerner (1994c) reports that general partners hold\nmore than one-third of the seats on the boards of\nventure-backed biotechnology firms--more than\nthe number held by management or other outside\ndirectors.85 Baker and Wruck (1989) describe a\nbuyout firm whose partnerships typically control\na majority of the board seats at their portfolio\ncompanies. Even if it is a minority investor, a\nprivate equity partnership usually has at least one\nboard seat and is able to participate actively in a\ncompany's management, with timely access to\ninformation.\nAllocation of Voting Rights. For early-stage new\nventures, leveraged buyouts, and financially\ndistressed firms, a partnership's investment is\noften large enough to confer majority ownership.\nIn other situations, the partnership may obtain\nvoting control even if it is not a majority share\nholder. Even if the partnership lacks voting\ncontrol, however, it is generally the largest\nnonmanagement shareholder. Thus, it has a\ndisproportionate degree of influence on matters\nthat come to a shareholder vote.\nIn general, a partnership's voting rights do not\ndepend on the type of stock issued. For example,\nholders of convertible preferred stock may be\nallowed to vote their shares on an as-converted\nbasis. Similarly, subordinated debt can be designed\n85. Barry and others (1990) report similar findings for\nventure-backed firms in other industries.\nso that investors have voting rights. The issue of\nvoting control can also be addressed by creating\nseparate classes of voting and nonvoting stock.\nControl of Access to Additional Financing. Seating\non boards of directors and voting control are not\nthe only ways partnerships can exercise control\nwithin their portfolio companies. Their ability to\nprovide a company with continued access to funds\nis also a powerful lever. This is especially the case\nfor new ventures. Venture capital is typically\nprovided to portfolio companies in several rounds\nat fairly well defined development stages, gener\nally with the amount provided just enough for the\nfirm to advance to the next stage of development.\nEven if diversification provisions in the partner\nship agreement prevent the partnership itself from\nproviding further financing, the general partners\nhave the power, through their extensive contacts,\nto bring in other investors. Conversely, if the\noriginal partnership is unwilling to arrange for\nadditional financing, it is unlikely that any other\npartnership will choose to do so; the reluctance of\nthe original partnership is a strong signal that the\ncompany is a poor investment.\nNon-venture capital is also provided in stages,\nthough to a lesser extent. For example, middle-\nmarket firms that embark on a strategy of acquisi\ntions periodically require capital infusions to\nfinance growth; that capital is not provided all at\nonce. Similarly, companies that undergo leveraged\nbuyouts are forced to service debt out of free cash\nflow and subsequently must justify the need for\nany new capital (see Palepu, 1990).\nOther Mechanisms. Other mechanisms by which\npartnerships control and monitor the activities of\nthe companies in which they invest include cove\nnants that give the partnership the right to inspect\nthe company's facilities, books, and records and to\nreceive timely financial reports and operating\nstatements. Other covenants require that the com\npany not sell stock or securities, merge or sell the\ncompany, or enter into large contracts without the\npartnership's approval.\nManaging Investments\nAfter investments are made, general partners are\nactive not only in monitoring and governing their\nportfolio companies but also in providing an array\nof consulting services. Private equity partnerships\nargue that their ability to ''add value'' by furnish\ning managerial assistance is a defining characteris\n\ntic of their enterprise that distinguishes them from\nother outside investors.86\nIn their monitoring and governance role, general\npartners help design compensation packages for\nsenior managers, replace senior managers as\nnecessary, and stay abreast of the company's\nfinancial condition through regular board meetings\nand interim financial reports. They also remain\ninformed through informal contacts with second-\nand third-level managers that they established\nduring the due diligence process. General partners\nprovide assistance by helping companies arrange\nadditional financing, hire top management, and\nrecruit knowledgeable board members. General\npartners also may become involved in solving\nmajor operational problems, evaluating capital\nexpenditures, and developing the company's\nlong-term strategy.\nNaturally, the degree of involvement varies with\nthe type of investment. Involvement is greatest in\nnew ventures--for which the quality of manage\nment is viewed as a key determinant of success or\nfailure--and in certain non-venture situations--\nfor which improving managerial performance is\none of the primary purposes of the investment\n(for example, leveraged buyouts). For these two\ntypes of firms, private equity investors typically\nare also majority owners, so the investors have\neven greater incentive, as well as authority, to\nbecome involved in the company's decision-\nmaking. Gorman and Sahlman (1989) report that\nventure capitalists on average visit each portfolio\nfirm for which they are the lead investor nineteen\ntimes a year and spend more than one hundred\nhours a year with each firm. Baker and Wruck\n(1989) suggest a similar level of involvement by\nthe buyout firm they examine.87 Even when the\ndegree of partnership involvement is lowest--for\nexample, when a partnership is a minority investor\nin large private or public companies--general\npartners may spend as much as a third of their\ntime with portfolio companies. A partnership\nrarely is a completely passive investor; an excep\ntion is the case of syndication, when other partner\nships may allow the lead investor to take the\nactive role.\n86. The joint production of ownership and consulting\nservices distinguishes partnerships not only from other outside\ninvestors, but also from other management consultants; unlike\nother management consultants, partnerships are paid exclu\nsively for performance (through carried interest paid to general\npartners).\n87. For every deal, the partnership designates one of the\ngeneral partners who has a background in operations to be a\nliaison to the firm. This general partner is in touch with the\nfirm daily and visits regularly.\nBecause venture investments require intensive\noversight, venture capital partnerships tend to\nspecialize by industry and geographic area to a\ngreater extent than other private equity partner\nships. Industry focus permits the partnership to\nbenefit from the expertise acquired assisting\nsimilar companies, while geographic proximity is\nnecessary to permit frequent visits to the company.\nIndeed, Lerner (1994c) documents that geographic\nproximity is an important determinant of board\nmembership for venture partnerships, and it\npresumably is an important determinant of man\nagerial oversight as well. Lerner also documents\nthat the number of general partners serving as\ncompany directors increases when the CEO lacks\nentrepreneurial experience and increases around\nthe time of CEO turnover, amplifying the point\nthat partnership involvement in management is\nmost extensive where the need for its participa\ntion is greatest. The high level of general partner\nparticipation in the management of young\ncompanies--along with the more demanding\nnature of the due diligence process for these\ncompanies--is thought by some to account for the\nprogression of some partnership management firms\nfrom venture investments to non-venture invest\nments after one or two funds as the partnership\nmanagers succumb to venture capital ''burnout.''\nExiting Investments\nAn important element of limited partnerships is\nthe contractual agreement to end the partnership\nand repay the limited partners within a specified\nperiod of time. Though repayment of the limited\npartners with illiquid securities of the portfolio\ncompanies is sometimes unavoidable, it is highly\nundesirable, as the limited partners then have\nneither liquidity nor control. Consequently, there\nmust be a clear route for the partnership to exit\nthe firm. The three possible exit routes are a\npublic offering, a private sale, and a share repur\nchase by the company.\nEach exit route has different ramifications for\nthe limited partners, the general partners, and the\ncompany's management. A public offering\ngenerally results in the highest valuation of a\ncompany and, thus, is often the preferred exit\nroute. In addition, company management favors an\nIPO because it preserves the firm's independence\nand provides it with continued access to capital by\ncreating a liquid market for the firm's securities.\nHowever, a public offering, unlike a private sale,\nusually does not end the partnership's involvement\n\nwith the firm. The partnership may be restricted\nfrom selling any or a portion of its shares in the\noffering by Rule 144, which requires that private\nplacements be held for an initial period of two\nyears. The partnership may also be restricted from\nselling its shares by agreement with the under\nwriter of the IPO. As a result, following a public\noffering there may be very little change in the\nnumber of shares or board seats held by the\npartnership (see Barry and others, 1990; and\nMuscarella and Vetsuypens, 1990). Gompers and\nLerner (1994b) suggest that in many cases general\npartners remain actively involved with portfolio\nfirms until the company's stock is eventually sold\nor distributed to the limited partners.\nA private sale has very different consequences.\nFor the limited and general partners, a private sale\nis attractive, as it provides payment in cash or\nmarketable securities and ends the partnership's\ninvolvement with the firm. For the company's\nmanagement, in contrast, a private sale is poten\ntially unwelcome, to the extent that the company\nis merged with or acquired by a larger company\nand cannot remain independent.\nThe third exit route is a put of stock back to the\nfirm, in the case of common stock, or a mandatory\nredemption, in the case of preferred shares. With\nputs of common stock, a valuation algorithm is\nagreed to in advance. For minority investments, a\nguaranteed buyout provision is essential, as it is\nthe only means by which the partnership firm can\nbe assured of liquidity. For many investments,\nhowever, buybacks by the firm are considered a\nbackup exit route and are used primarily when the\ninvestment has been unsuccessful.\nPartnerships add value to investments by\nchoosing how and when to exit and by obtaining\nthe maximum value for the firm in connection\nwith any given exit strategy. Several studies\ndocument the valuable role that partnerships play\nin connection with public offerings. Megginson\nand Weiss (1991) find that companies backed by\nventure capital are underpriced by a smaller\namount than companies that are not venture\nbacked; similarly, Barry and others (1990) find\nthat the degree of underpricing of venture-backed\nfirms is negatively related to the size of the\nventure capitalists' ownership stake, the age of the\nlead partnership management firm, and the length\nof time the lead partnership has served on the\nfirm's board. Less underpricing may reflect a\ncertification premium--reputable partnerships do\nnot bring lemons to market--as well as the value\nof the partnership's ongoing management activi\nties. As noted earlier, partnerships in many cases\nretain their ownership stake and board positions\nfor some period after companies are taken public.\nLess underpricing has also been found in the case\nof reverse leveraged buyouts (see Muscarella and\nVetsuypens, 1989), possibly also a result of their\naffiliation with private equity partnerships.\nAlso of value in the process of going public is\na partnership's ability to time the market. Lerner\n(1994b) examines the behavior of prices of\nbiotechnology shares around the IPO issue dates\nfor venture-backed biotechnology firms. He\ndocuments a strong run-up in share prices before\nthe offering date and a fall in prices after the\noffering date, with more experienced general\npartners showing a greater ability to time the\nmarket peak. Although the partnership sells few, if\nany, shares at the offering--and therefore does not\nbenefit directly from the higher prices--it benefits\nindirectly by suffering less dilution.\nRelationship between the Limited Partners\nand the General Partners\nBy investing through a partnership rather than\ndirectly in issuing firms, investors delegate to the\ngeneral partners the labor-intensive responsibilities\nof selecting, structuring, managing, and eventually\nliquidating private equity investments. However,\nlimited partners must be concerned with how\neffectively the general partners safeguard their\ninterests. Among the more obvious ways in which\ngeneral partners can further their own inter\nests at the expense of the limited partners are\nspending too little effort monitoring and advising\nportfolio firms; charging excessive management\nfees; taking undue investment risks; and reserving\nthe most attractive investment opportunities for\nthemselves and their associates.\nResolution of these problems lies in the nature\nof partnerships themselves and in the structure of\nthe partnership agreement. First, partnerships have\nfinite lives; to remain in business, private equity\nmanagers must regularly raise new funds, and\nfund raising is less costly for more reputable\nfirms. Second, the general partners' compensation\nis closely linked to the partnership's performance.\nFund Raising and the Role of Reputation\nBecause partnerships have finite lives, the private\nequity managers who serve as general partners\n\nmust regularly raise new funds in order to stay in\nbusiness. In fact, to invest in portfolio companies\non a continuing basis, managers must raise a new\npartnership once the funds from the existing part\nnership are fully invested, or about once every\nthree to five years.\nThe raising of partnerships is very time con\nsuming and costly, involving presentations to\ninstitutional investors and their advisers that can\ntake from two months to well over a year\ndepending on the general partners' reputation\nand experience.88 A favorable track record is\nimportant because it conveys some information\nabout ability and suggests that partnership\nmanagers will take extra care to protect their\nreputation, and because experience itself is\nregarded as an asset.\nTo minimize their fund-raising expenses, part\nnership managers generally turn first to those that\ninvested in their previous partnerships--assuming,\nof course, that their previous relationships were\nsatisfactory. In addition, funds are often raised in\nseveral stages, referred to as ''closings.'' This\napproach appears to be primarily a device for\ncommunicating to the investment community that\na fund is being successfully raised, implying a\nfavorable evaluation of the fund by those that have\nalready committed.\nBecause of the difficulties of raising partner\nships, general partners are not indifferent to the\ntype of investors that invest with them; they prefer\ninvestors that have a long-term commitment to\nprivate equity investing.89 Because past investors\nare most familiar with a general partner's ability,\ngeneral partners face greater difficulties when\nexperienced investors withdraw from the market.\nThe instability of institutional investors has been\ndemonstrated several times recently. For instance,\ninsurance companies drastically reduced their\ncommitments to private equity and other illiquid\nand risky classes of assets in 1990 owing to\n88. The industry press frequently offers accounts of fund\nraising efforts, both successful and unsuccessful. In spring\n1994, for example, the $225 million seventh fund of Kleiner\nPerkins Caufield & Byers (KPCB) was oversubscribed when it\nwas launched despite the above-average profit share (30 per\ncent) retained by its managers. KPCB had to ration commit\nments among its existing limited partners and was extremely\nselective about taking on new ones. Around the same time,\nHamilton Robinson and Co. scrapped its $100 million second\nfund after nearly two years of unsuccessful fund raising efforts.\nAmong its difficulties was an inability to secure commitments\nfrom investors in its first fund (Venture Capital Journal,\nAugust/September 1994).\n89. Wealthy individuals, university endowments, and\nfoundations are regarded as among the most stable investors in\nprivate equity.\nconcerns among the public about insurance\ncompanies' financial condition. More recently,\nIBM, a major corporate pension fund investor,\nwithdrew from the private equity market as part of\na broad reduction in pension staff. Looking ahead,\nthere is concern that the interest of public pension\nplans, currently the largest investor group in terms\nof amount of private equity held, will not prove to\nbe stable; for this reason, some general partners\nregard public pension plans as less desirable\ninvestors and may avoid them if possible.90\nPerformance Measurement\nBecause reputation plays such a critical role in\nprivate equity markets, reliable methods for\nmeasuring the past performance of partnerships\nand their managers are essential. Market partici\npants use a variety of quantitative and qualitative\nmethods to measure performance.\nThe most commonly used performance measure\nis internal rate of return. Internal rates of return\ncan be calculated at any stage of a partnership's\nlife. However, the internal rate of return of a\n''young'' partnership depends on the accounting\nmethods used to value the partnership's illiquid\nassets. Venture capitalists have developed a fairly\nstandard set of accounting principles, but the\naccounting methods used to value non-venture\ninvestments are reportedly less uniform. In the\ncase of venture capital, investments are recorded\nat cost unless they have been marked down at the\ndiscretion of the general partner or marked up as a\nresult of a significant third-party transaction (for\nexample, a subsequent round of financing involv\ning a third party). In the case of non-venture\ninvestments, the appropriate markups are more\ndifficult to determine because there are typically\nfewer follow-on investments from which invest\nment values can be updated. For both types of\ninvestments, more weight is given to the cash\nreturn of a mature fund than to the accounting\nreturn of a younger fund.\nInvestors rely only partly on internal rates of\nreturn to measure past performance, not only\nbecause the accounting returns of younger partner\nships are difficult to verify and interpret but also\nbecause partnership returns are highly variable.\nAn exceptional return on a single investment can\n90. A corollary is that general partners that rely on public\npension funds could be less interested in accumulating reputa\ntional capital, and thus have somewhat weaker performance\nincentives.\n\nsignificantly boost the performance of an entire\nfund. Consequently, high cash returns on earlier\npartnerships may reflect good luck more than good\njudgment and thus may be an unreliable indicator\nof the general partners' skills.\nPotential investors and their advisers often\nconduct a detailed empirical analysis of partner\nship returns. Among the factors that can be exam\nined are the distribution of individual investment\nreturns. For example, to address the possibility\nthat one stellar investment masks many poor ones,\npartnership returns based on all but the highest-\nyielding investment can be calculated. Even more\nimportant than an examination of the distribution\nof returns is an analysis of the relationship, if any,\nbetween individual investment returns and invest\nment characteristics, such as the industry, size, and\nlocation of the portfolio companies. Such an\nanalysis is relevant, for example, if a partnership\nis raising funds to invest in specific industries.\nFinally, investors can examine the relationship\nbetween investment returns and the general\npartners responsible for managing the investments;\nthis is especially important if the partnership\nmanagement firm has recently lost some key\npersonnel.\nAnother approach to measuring past perfor\nmance is to make a purely qualitative assessment\nof a partnership management firm's skills. In some\ninstances potential limited partners have co-invested\nalongside an earlier partnership, and this experi\nence has given them an opportunity to observe\nhow the general partners structure and manage\ntheir investments, providing insights into the\ngeneral partners' management skills. Potential\nlimited partners that have not co-invested along\nside an earlier partnership may consult others that\nhave and may even contact companies in which\nthe general partners have invested.91\nGathering and analyzing information on partner\nships and their returns is costly. As the private\nequity market expanded in the 1980s, a market\nfor investment advisory services developed, and\ninstitutional investors, especially those new to the\nmarket, increasingly rely on private equity advis\ners to evaluate partnerships. Advisers have played\nan important role in devising new approaches to\nmeasuring partnership performance.\n91. The possibility of using information gathered from\nco-investments to evaluate partnership managers illustrates an\nimportant complementarity between partnership and direct\ninvesting. This is discussed in the section on direct investments\nlater in this chapter.\nTransparency of the Partnership Structure\nCertain features of the structure of a partnership\nenhance the ability of the general partners to\nestablish a reputation. These features essentially\nmake both the partnership's performance and\nthe managers' activities more transparent to\ninvestors than might be the case for other finan\ncial intermediaries.\nOne such feature is segregated investment\npools, whereby the investments of each partner\nship are kept separate. By comparing one partner-\nship's investment returns with the returns on other\npartnerships raised at the same time, it is easier to\naccount for factors that are beyond the control of\nthe general partners, such as the stage of the\nbusiness cycle or the condition of the IPO market\nand the mergers and acquisitions markets. If\nprivate equity intermediaries did not maintain\nsegregated investment pools, earnings would\nrepresent a blend of investment returns that occur\nat different stages of the business cycle or under\ndifferent market conditions.\nAnother important feature of the partnership\nstructure is the separation of management\nexpenses and investment funds. In a limited\npartnership, management fees are specified in the\npartnership agreement (see next section), so the\namount of investment capital that can be con\nsumed in the form of manager salaries and other\nperquisites is capped. The transparency of such\nexpenses makes comparisons of expenses across\npartnerships easier. Other types of financial\nintermediaries pay expenses and finance invest\nments out of the same funds raised from investors;\nalthough expenses are reported, they are difficult\nto control before the fact and not always transpar\nent after the fact.\nSahlman (1990) and Gompers and Lerner\n(1994a) note that some partnerships do not set\nmanagement fees in advance; rather they negotiate\nan expense budget with the limited partners\nannually. This arrangement provides flexibility\nbut preserves most of the desirable features of\nprearranged management fees--investor control\nand transparency.\nThe Partnership Agreement\nThe general partners' need to establish a favorable\ntrack record with investors and their advisers\nmitigates, but does not eliminate, potential\nconflicts between the limited and general partners.\nThe effectiveness of reputation as an incentive to\n\nsafeguard the limited partners' interests is espe\ncially uncertain when general partners are near\nthe beginning or end of their careers. In the\nformer case, a general partner's ''reputational\ncapital'' may be insufficient to deter him or her\nfrom opportunistic behavior; in the latter case, the\nvalue of that capital may be diminished by the\nprospect that the general partner will not be\nraising another partnership fund.\nThe provisions of the partnership agreement\nitself also offer protection for limited partners. The\nagreement sets forth not only the broad terms of\nthe general partners' compensation structure--such\nas their share of the profits--but also important\ndetails on how management fees and profit shares\nare calculated. Such details can significantly affect\nthe general partners' incentive to engage in\nbehavior that does not maximize value for inves\ntors. The partnership agreement also includes\ncovenants that restrict the general partners from\nengaging in certain activities and provides the\nlimited partners with limited oversight over the\ngeneral partners.\nGeneral Partner Compensation\nGeneral partners earn a management fee and a\nshare of a partnership's profits, the latter referred\nto as carried interest. For a partnership that yields\naverage returns, carried interest may be several\ntimes larger than the management fees (Sahlman,\n1990).92 This arrangement--providing limited\ncompensation for making and managing invest\nments and significant compensation in the form\nof profit sharing--lies at the heart of the partner-\nship's incentive structure.\nManagement Fees. In setting annual management\nfees, the general and limited partners must agree\non both the fee percentage and the base on which\nthe fee is assessed. Management fees are fre\nquently set at a fixed percentage of committed\n92. Sahlman's (1990) calculations assume that the general\npartners receive only half of all management fees--the other\nhalf are used to pay expenses--and that the general partners\nuse the same discount rate to value management fees and\ncarried interest. Gompers and Lerner (1994a) use the actual\nterms of 441 venture capital partnership agreements and more\nconservative discounting assumptions to simulate the composi\ntion of the general partners' compensation structure. Their\nsimulations indicate that carried interest accounts for more than\nhalf of the general partners' total compensation, even if carried\ninterest is discounted at twice the rate of management fees\n(assuming, as Sahlman does, that the general partners receive\nhalf of all management fees.)\ncapital and remain at that level over the partner-\nship's life. Fee percentages range from 1 percent\nto 3 percent; the majority of venture funds charge\n2 percent to 2.5 percent (Sahlman, 1990; Gompers\nand Lerner, 1994a), but some larger venture part\nnerships as well as many non-venture partnerships\ncharge less, owing, perhaps, to economies of\nscale.93\nIn recent years there has been a trend toward\nlower and variable management fees. Investors\nargue that management fees ought to reflect more\nclosely the activities of the general partners. The\ngeneral partners are usually busiest in the early\nand middle years of the partnership as they screen\npotential investments, structure deals, and oversee\nportfolio companies. Their involvement declines in\nthe partnership's later years as portfolio companies\nare taken public or sold and as the general\npartners turn toward raising their next partnership.\nTo reflect the different degrees of involvement,\nmany partnership agreements now specify higher\nfee percentages in years two through five of the\nfund and lower fee percentages thereafter. In many\ncases the general partners are paid no management\nfees after the partnership's original termination\ndate, even if the limited partners vote to extend\nthe partnership's life. This fee structure encour\nages the general partners to get money back to\ninvestors quickly and to start raising a new\npartnership.\nThe trend toward lower fees and a more ''hump\nshaped'' fee structure is also reflected in changes\nin the fee base. Fees during the investment period\nare now often quoted as a percentage of invested\ncapital rather than committed capital.94 This\n93. Gompers and Lerner (1994a) find strong evidence that\nmanagement fees, as a percentage of committed capital,\ndecrease with venture fund size, but they interpret the relation\ndifferently. Their model indicates that older, more reputable\nfirms should receive more variable compensation and less fixed\ncompensation because such firms are not motivated by the need\nto establish reputation. Because the oldest partnership organiza\ntions in their data set raised the largest funds, they interpret the\nnegative relation between fund size and management fees as\nconsistent with their model's predictions. However, because\nfund size and organization age are so highly correlated in their\nsample, they cannot accurately distinguish size and age effects.\nFew data are available on the terms of non-venture private\nequity partnerships. Our conversations with partnership spon\nsors, and occasional references to partnership terms in the trade\npress, suggest that the larger non-venture partnerships charge\nsubstantially less than 2.5 percent, regardless of the organiza-\ntion's age. See, for example, The Private Equity Analyst,\nMarch 1992, which discusses three buyout partnerships, each\napproximately $1 billion in size, that charge management fees\naveraging around 1 percent.\n94. Committed capital is the full amount that investors have\ncommitted to a partnership fund; invested capital is the amount\nof committed capital that the partnership has invested in\nportfolio companies.\n\npractice both results in lower fees and encourages\nthe general partners to invest committed capital as\nsoon as possible; it also lessens the general\npartners' incentive to obtain more commitments\nthan can be profitably invested, as excess commit\nments will not result in higher management fees.\nThe practice of basing fees on the current value of\nthe partnership's investments rather than on their\noriginal cost--which can result in steadily increas\ning fees until near the end of a partnership's\nlife--has been virtually eliminated; it enabled\ngeneral partners to earn higher fees merely by\ninflating investment values.95\nFinally, although partnership agreements\ngenerally treat all limited partners identically, it is\nnot uncommon for the largest limited partners to\nnegotiate separately to reduce their management\nfees. The rationale for special treatment is that by\ninvesting large amounts, large investors reduce the\ncosts of fund raising. Moreover, because certain\ninstitutional investors are widely acknowledged\nas having developed expertise in private equity\ninvesting, their investment serves as a positive\nsignal to other institutional investors, further\nreducing fund-raising costs; indeed, their invest\nment may carry more weight with other investors\nthan an endorsement by a third-party investment\nadviser.\nThe recent trend toward lower management fees\nand the adoption of new methods of calculating\nthem to some extent reflect the competitive con\nditions in the private equity market in the early\n1990s, when many of these changes were initiated.\nDisappointing partnership returns in the late 1980s\nwere followed by a lower level of partnership\ncommitments in the early 1990s. The resulting\ncompetition for funds put downward pressure on\nmanagement fees and, to a lesser extent, on\ncarried interest. Many of these changes persisted\ninto 1993-94 despite the record level of fund\nraising, however, suggesting that they evolved\npartly because limited partners were becoming\nmore sophisticated in negotiating with general\npartners.96\n95. Gompers and Lerner (1994a) document the near elimina\ntion of such fee arrangements from venture capital partnerships.\nIn their sample, 21 percent of the funds established during\n1978-83 had fees based on current asset value; the percentage\ndeclined to 8 percent for funds established during 1984-89 and\n2 percent for funds established during 1990-92. They also find\nsome evidence that such arrangements resulted in more\naggressive valuations of fund assets by the general partners.\n96. Gompers and Lerner (1994a) address this possibility.\nThey make the point that because private equity partnerships\nare a relatively recent development, and because returns are\nrealized over a long period of time, it is sensible to view such\norganizations in an evolutionary framework.\nCarried Interest. Carried interest--the general\npartners' share of a partnership's profits--is most\noften set at 20 percent of the partnership's net\nreturn. Gompers and Lerner (1994a) report a\nstriking degree of uniformity in the carried inter\nest for venture capital partnerships: More than\n80 percent of their sample use an ''80/20 profit-\nsharing rule.'' Carried interest among non-venture\npartnerships appears to be somewhat less uniform.\nAlthough the percentage devoted to carried\ninterest has been remarkably stable, the rules for\ncalculating net return have recently evolved in\nfavor of the limited partners. Under earlier\nagreements, particularly those for LBO partner\nships, carried interest was based on the returns on\nindividual investments; now it is typically based\non the return on the partnership's entire portfolio.\nOther things equal, this change favors the limited\npartners when a single investment results in a loss.\nMore important, it harmonizes the investment\nobjectives of the partnership's managers with\nthose of the limited partners. Under the earlier\narrangement, partnership managers were less\nconcerned with total returns than with maxi\nmizing the returns of the most successful indi\nvidual investments. It was in their interest to\nconcentrate their resources on the partnership's\nemerging ''home runs'' while neglecting invest\nments whose performance was average or below\naverage.\nTo implement the change in calculating carried\ninterest, it has been necessary to adopt ''claw\nback'' provisions. Distributions of cash and\nsecurities to the limited and general partners are\nmade as the partnership's investments are liqui\ndated and may begin as early as the second or\nthird year; later, the limited partners' return may\nbecome negative owing to losses on remaining\ninvestments. Clawback provisions preserve the\nlimited partners' right to recover their capital and\nmanagement fees before the general partners\nreceive carried interest by requiring the general\npartners to give back their earlier distributions.\nWithout such provisions, the general partners\ncould augment their returns by distributing gains\nearly and holding on to losing investments.\nOther factors that affect the limited and general\npartners' profit shares are the partnership's\naccounting and distribution policies. In the past,\npartnerships typically valued the stock of IPO\nfirms that they distributed at the current market\nprice and based carried interest on this valuation.\nHowever, given that many IPO shares have limited\nliquidity, the limited partners may drive the\nstock's price down against themselves when they\n\nattempt to sell the stock for cash. Many lim\nited partners have attempted to insert into\ntheir partnership agreements clauses forcing\ngeneral partners to distribute cash instead of\nstock or to discount the value of their stock\ndistributions.97\nFinally, some general partners offer limited\npartners priority returns of 5 percent to 10 per\ncent. This provision requires that investors receive\na priority return before the general partners begin\nto receive a share of the partnership's profits.\nIn some cases, the general partners simply receive\na fixed percentage of all returns in excess of the\npriority return. In other cases, the general partners\nreceive all returns in excess of the priority return\nup to 20 percent of the partnership's cumulative\nprofits (assuming an 80/20 profit sharing rule);\nat that point they receive 20 percent of all addi\ntional returns. In either case, the priority return\nprovision ensures that the general partners realize\na gain only if the fund outperforms traditional\ninvestments. In this respect, it links general\npartner compensation to the investment objectives\nof private equity investors.98\n97. The latter requirement may seem both unnecessary and\nunreasonable. If shares of stock are distributed pro rata among\nthe limited and general partners, the valuation of those shares\nshould not matter. Furthermore, general partners will experi\nence the same difficulties selling their shares on the open\nmarket as the limited partners. Valuation will matter, however,\nif their initial investments have not been returned to the limited\npartners; in that case, the higher the valuation of a stock\ndistribution, the closer it will bring the general partners to\ndrawing their carried interest. Moreover, even if the general\npartners are already drawing their carry and the securities are\ndistributed pro rata, the general partners may have an opportu\nnity to sell their shares before the limited partners do, and at\nhigher prices. Preliminary evidence reported by Gompers and\nLerner (1994b) suggests that general partners time their\ndistributions to take advantage of high market valuations:\nCumulative abnormal returns over the two days following a\ndistribution--the approximate length of time it takes the shares\nto reach the limited partners--are negative and statistically\nsignificant. However Gompers and Lerner do not address the\nissue of whether general partners actually sell their shares\nimmediately. Finally, it may simply be the case that limited\npartners do not feel comfortable managing these stock distri\nbutions and believe that general partners could do a better\njob.\n98. Priority return provisions have become especially\ncommon in LBO funds and other large non-venture partner\nships (The Private Equity Analyst, July 1991), possibly a\nconsequence of the similarity of returns on non-venture\npartnerships and the returns available on traditional invest\nments. For such partnerships, it is especially important that\nfund managers have a strong incentive to outperform these\nbenchmarks. In contrast, venture capital partnerships tend to\nperform either much better than or significantly worse than\ntraditional investments, and giving venture capital managers\nadditional incentives to outperform the market is not as\ncritical.\nPartnership Covenants\nPartnership agreements also protect the interests of\nthe limited partners through covenants that place\nrestrictions on a partnership's investments and on\ncertain other activities of the general partners.99\nRestrictions on investments are especially impor\ntant because a significant portion of the general\npartners' compensation is in the form of an\noption-like claim on the fund's assets. This form\nof compensation can lead to excessive risk-taking\n(see Jensen and Meckling, 1976); in particular, it\nmay be in the interest of the general partners to\nmaximize the partnership's risk--and hence the\nexpected value of their carried interest--rather\nthan the partnership's risk-adjusted expected rate\nof return. As Sahlman (1990) notes, recent\ninnovations such as offering investors priority\nreturns can, in principle, increase the incentives\nfor risk-taking, as they place the general partners'\nstake farther ''out of the money.''\nTo address the problems of excessive risk-\ntaking, partnership covenants usually set limits on\nthe percentage of the partnership's capital that\nmay be invested in a single firm or on the aggre\ngate size of the partnership's two or three largest\ninvestments. Covenants may also specifically\npreclude investments in publicly traded and for\neign securities, derivatives, and other private\nequity funds and private equity investments that\ndeviate significantly from the partnership's\nprimary focus (for example, LBO investments in\nthe case of venture capital funds). Finally, cov\nenants usually restrict the fund's use of debt and\nin many cases require that cash from the sale of\nportfolio assets be distributed to investors immedi\nately. Each of these restrictions is intended\nprimarily to limit the general partners' ability to\nundertake greater risk in ways that benefit them\nselves at the expense of the limited partners.\nBesides taking excessive risks, general part\nners can further their interests at the expense of\ninvestors in other ways. For example, the general\npartners may make investments in order to\ngenerate fee income for themselves or their\naffiliates; invest in companies in which other\npartnerships that they manage have equity stakes\nin order to boost the valuation of those companies;\nor use personal funds to co-invest in only the\npartnership's most attractive investments. Partner\nship agreements address these potential problems\n99. The following discussion of partnership covenants and\ntheir economic motivation is based largely on Sahlman (1990),\nWeinberg (1994), and Gompers and Lerner (1995).\n\nby limiting deal fees (fees paid to general partners\nupon completion of individual investments) or\nrequiring that deal fees be offset against manage\nment fees; by restricting co-investment with the\ngeneral partners' earlier or later funds; and by\nrestricting the ability of general partners and their\nassociates to co-invest selectively in the partner-\nship's deals.\nIn an examination of the evolution of covenants\nin venture capital partnerships, Gompers and\nLerner (1995) find that investment restrictions,\nboth general and specific, increased markedly after\n1988, roughly the same time new methods for\ndetermining management fees and carried interest\nwere evolving. Both developments can be viewed\nas resulting from greater investor understanding of\nthe way partnerships operate.\nOversight and Control Rights\nFinally, partnership agreements protect limited\npartners by allowing them some degree of over\nsight over the partnership. Most partnerships have\nan advisory board composed of the largest limited\npartners. These boards are intended to help resolve\nsuch matters as conflicts involving deal fees and\nconflict-of-interest transactions. They typically\ndo so by approving exemptions from partnership\ncovenants. Special committees are also created\nto help determine the value of the partnership's\ninvestments. However, these two types of bodies\ndo not provide the kind of management oversight\nthat a board of directors can provide for a cor\nporation; indeed, their power is limited by the\nlegal nature of the partnership, which prohibits\nlimited partners from taking an active role in\nmanagement.\nAnother other form of control sometimes\navailable to investors is the ability to vote on such\nmatters as removing a general partner or ending\nthe partnership before its termination date. These\ndecisions usually require a supermajority vote\n(Sahlman, 1990). Weinberg (1994) maintains that\nonly ''an organized and determined group of\nlimited partners\"''can obtain such provisions,\nas general partners strongly resist such terms.\nDirect Investment\nWe conclude this chapter by examining the role\nof direct investments in the private equity market.\nLimited partnerships account for 80 percent of\nprivate equity investments and virtually all\ninvestments by intermediaries. However, approxi\nmately 20 percent of private equity investments\nare made directly by institutional investors. This\nsection describes the benefits of direct investment\nand the complementarity between direct and\npartnership investments. We note that direct\ninvesting is feasible for institutional investors in\npart because partnerships generate a high level of\ninvestment activity, which provides opportunities\nfor institutional investors, and because institutional\ninvestors are able to learn of these opportunities\nthrough their relationships with general partners.\nCo-investment\nCo-investments are direct investments in portfolio\ncompanies by limited partners alongside private\nequity partnerships. In the usual case, limited\npartners acquire the securities on the same terms\nas the partnership but pay no management fee or\ncarried interest. Co-investors essentially obtain the\nbenefits of the general partners' management\nactivities at no cost. If it were possible to\nassemble a well-diversified portfolio of\nco-investments, co-investing would dominate\npartnership investing. In practice, however,\nco-investment opportunities are limited and are\noutside the control of institutional investors.\nCo-investment opportunities arise when gen\neral partners need additional investors to close a\ndeal. For this reason, co-investments are viewed\nby investors as a means of enhancing partnership\nreturns rather than as an alternative to partnership\ninvestments. Many institutional investors regard\nthe opportunity to co-invest as a key factor in\ndeciding which partnerships to invest in.\nSome institutional investors view co-investment\nas an entree to direct investing. Their ultimate\nobjective is direct investment in private equity,\nand for them co-investing is an opportunity to gain\nexposure and acquire expertise in private equity\ninvesting--in effect, a form of apprenticeship\nnormally provided by the position of associate\nwithin a partnership management firm. For such\ninvestors, a primary reason for continuing to\ninvest in partnerships is to retain access to\nco-investments.\nTo general partners, limited partners that stand\nready to co-invest represent a flexible source of\nfunds for closing deals. In this respect, syndication\nand co-investment are substitutes. The benefits of\nsyndication to the general partners were noted\nearlier: One is that the general partners of other\npartnerships in the syndicate are active investors\n\ncapable of critically reviewing a deal beforehand\nand of providing valuable post-investment moni\ntoring and advisory services; another is that\nsyndication represents a favor that other general\npartners may feel obliged to return, improving the\noriginating general partners' future investment\nopportunities. Co-investment, on the other hand,\ncreates goodwill with limited partners, improving\nthe chances that they will commit promptly to the\ngeneral partners' next fund. Also, limited partners\nare less demanding co-investors than are other\npartnerships, as the latter usually have a voice in\nhow deals are structured. Thus, the choice between\nsyndication and bringing in limited partners as\nco-investors depends on (1) the ability and\nwillingness of limited partners to co-invest, (2) the\nvalue of reciprocal future benefits that limited\npartners and other general partners can offer, and\n(3) the general partners' primary need--funds only\nor value-added investment services (for example,\nlocal monitoring).100\nDirect Investment Other than Co-investment\nIn contrast to co-investments, other direct invest\nments require institutional investors to perform all\nthe activities normally performed by the general\npartners of a private equity partnership: originating\ndeals and structuring, monitoring, and exiting\ninvestments. To become a direct investor, an\ninstitution must have on its staff individuals who\nperform the same functions as the staff of a\npartnership management firm. Moreover, to\nmaintain sufficient diversification, adequate deal\nflow, and ties with other private equity investors\n(including private equity partnerships), a direct\ninvestor must invest continuously, unlike the\nco-investor, who invests only as the opportunity\narises. In many ways, a direct investor behaves\nlike a private equity partnership.\nWe observed earlier that, other things equal,\nexpected returns on co-investments exceed\nexpected returns on partnership investments. This\nis not true for direct investments. Although a\n100. We noted earlier that general partners prefer limited\npartners with whom they can establish a long-term relationship.\nThese are the limited partners to whom general partners are\nmost likely to offer co-investments. There are, however, other\nfactors that influence the suitability of a limited partner for\nco-investing. One is the limited partner's ability to make a\nquick decision. Public pension plans are not well suited to\nco-investing, as their investments typically are subject to a\nslow and cumbersome approval process.\ndirect investor avoids the expense of management\nfees and carried interest, it bears the investment\nexpenses normally incurred by general partners.\nThus, the return on direct investments depends\non the skill and efficiency of the investment staff.\nIn many instances, it is the belief that their staffs\nhave superior skills that motivates institutions to\ninvest directly.\nEven if an institutional investor has highly\nskilled individuals on its staff, the institution\nmay not benefit directly. If the compensation of\nthese individuals is the same as the compensation\nthey would receive as general partners, the\nindividuals, and not the institution, will earn\nexcess profits.101\nThere are several other reasons, however,\nwhy direct investing may be more profitable to\nan institution than investing through an inde\npendent intermediary. First, because the institu\ntion is investing only its own funds, it has no\nfund-raising expenses; unlike a private equity\npartnership, the staff can focus on its invest\nments. Second, investment decisions are not\nconstrained by restrictions normally imposed\nby partnership agreements. Third, there may be\ngains to risk-sharing between the institution and\nits staff: The staff's compensation may be tied\nto the performance of the portfolio firms, but\nnot to the same extent as for independent private\nequity fund managers; because the staff bears\nless risk, it may require less in (expected)\nremuneration.102\nFinancial institutions occasionally sponsor and\ninvest in their own private equity partnerships.\nThey do so primarily to take advantage of comple\nmentarities between private equity investing and\ntheir other activities (underwriting in the case of\ninvestment banks, for example, and lending in the\ncase of commercial banks). Also, sponsoring a\npartnership may generate some of the cost savings\nof direct investing: Because financial institutions\nare frequently large investors in their own partner\nships, their partnerships may have lower fund\nraising costs than independent partnerships of the\nsame size.\n101. If the individuals are not compensated at the same level\nas the general partners of a private equity partnership, they will\nmost likely leave and form their own private equity firm.\n102. This last point was suggested to us by several institu\ntional investors. They indicated that their compensation\nstructure was similar to that of an independent private equity\norganization, although the base salary and bonus given to\ninvestment staff members was somewhat higher, and the carried\ninterest somewhat lower.\n\nSimultaneous Direct Investment\nand Partnership Investment\nMost private equity investors that invest directly\nalso invest through partnerships. In part, this\ncan be understood as the result of diminishing\nmarginal returns to each activity where the two\nforms of investment compete directly for a share\nof the investors' portfolios. Like private equity\npartnerships, institutional investors that invest\ndirectly must specialize by type and stage of\ninvestment, industry, and region, as it is not\neconomical to maintain a staff of private equity\nspecialists that have expertise in all areas. Part\nnership investments allow an investor to diversify.\nA common arrangement, for example, is direct\ninvestment in later-stage venture capital combined\nwith partnership investments in early-stage venture\ncapital.\nSimultaneous direct investment and partnership\ninvestment is also a result of complementarity\nbetween the two areas. Partnership investment, on\nthe one hand, permits an investor to personally\nmeet with many private equity fund managers and\nto co-invest with them. These relationships build\na bridge to the private equity community and help\nthe investor gain access to syndicated deals. In\nventure capital, these deals are frequently later\nrounds of equity financing to firms in the port\nfolios of venture capital partnerships. Direct\ninvestment, on the other hand, provides an\nopportunity for an institutional investor to invest\nalongside a private equity manager and to observe\nfirsthand the manager's effectiveness. Among\ninstitutional investors, such firsthand experience\nis an important source of information used in\ndeciding which partnerships to invest in.103\n103. Insurance companies are a particularly interesting\nexample of directing investing leading to partnership investing.\nUnlike most institutional investors, which first invest in private\nequity funds and then progress up the learning curve to\nco-investments and direct investments, many insurance compa\nnies began investing in private equity directly in the form of\nmezzanine debt. Because they were accustomed to making their\nown investment decisions, they were initially reluctant to invest\nin partnerships. Eventually, they found themselves investing in\nmezzanine debt alongside private equity partnerships; on the\nbasis of relationships forged in these investments they began to\ninvest in private equity funds.\nConclusion\nAmong the most interesting aspects of the private\nequity market is the manner in which the extreme\nsorting and incentive problems are resolved.\nBecause little information about firms that issue\nprivate equity is publicly available, outside\ninvestors must engage in a significant amount of\ndue diligence and post-investment monitoring.\nThese activities are not efficiently performed if the\noutside equity is widely held; consequently, most\noutside equity is held by private equity intermedi\naries. Such intermediaries specialize in finding,\nstructuring, and managing private equity invest\nments in private companies, in which they are\namong the largest and most active shareholders.\nHowever, this arrangement gives rise to equally\nsevere information and incentive problems\nbetween institutional investors (the investors that\nprovide the intermediary with its funds) and the\nintermediary's managers. Private equity limited\npartnerships have emerged as the best organiza\ntional form for addressing these problems, and\nmany current features of the private equity market\ncan be viewed as resulting from the evolution of\nthis organizational structure.\nSahlman (1990) emphasizes the similarities of\nthe mechanisms used to resolve the sorting and\nincentive problems between a partnership and its\nportfolio companies, on the one hand, and between\nthe partnership and its investors, on the other.\nAlthough the similarities are numerous and\nimportant, especially regarding the compensation\nstructure for portfolio company managers and\ngeneral partners, the differences are also important.\nGeneral partners provide extensive oversight over\nthe companies they invest in. Majority investors,\nin particular, are able to intervene quickly, should\ncompany performance suffer, through positions on\nboards of directors and, to a lesser extent, through\nvoting control. In this sense, they are able to keep\nportfolio companies on a ''short leash.'' The\nprovision of capital in stages amplifies their\ncontrol. Limited partners are not--and indeed\ncannot be--similarly empowered. Instead, they\nrely heavily on the mechanism of reputation,\nwhich derives from the general partners' knowl\nedge that they will need to raise money from these\ninstitutions on a regular basis, and on incentives in\nthe partnership agreement that encourage general\npartners to maximize returns to limited partners.\n\n5. Investors in the Private Equity Market\nThe number of institutions that invest in private\nequity has grown substantially since the 1970s.\nThe growth has been particularly strong among\npension funds and endowments and foundations,\nwhich are the largest investors: One recent survey\nindicates that 54 percent of large pension funds\nand endowments and foundations committed\ncapital to private equity in 1992, compared with\nonly 11 percent in 1975.104 It is still generally the\ncase, however, that only the largest institutions\nhold private equity.\nIn this chapter we describe the investment\npatterns of the major investor groups. For each\nmajor group, the largest institutions tend to invest\nboth directly and through limited partnerships.\nInvestors generally begin investing in private\nequity through limited partnerships. Those that\nbroaden their activities to direct investment may\nbegin by co-investing alongside partnerships to\ngain experience in structuring, monitoring, and\nexiting deals. For example, corporate pension\nfunds and endowments, among the first investors\nin limited partnerships, are large co-investors. The\ncontinued development of a direct investment\nprogram then depends on an institution's ability\nto generate, select, and manage investments on its\nown. Public pension funds, with limited access to\ndeal flow and little experience, are the least likely\nto invest directly.\nCorporate Pension Funds\nCorporate pension funds began investing\nheavily in private equity limited partnerships in\nthe early 1980s. Their reasons for investing are\nalmost purely financial: They are attracted by the\nmarket's high returns and diversification benefits\nand are, market participants note, effectively\nprohibited by ERISA laws from making strategic\ninvestments that benefit their parent companies.\nSince the early 1980s corporate pension funds\nhave consistently provided roughly one quarter\nof total commitments to private equity partnerships\n(table 9).\n104. 1992 survey of alternative investments conducted by\nGoldman, Sachs & Co. and Frank Russell Co. Survey results\nare based on 194 investors that had collective assets of\n$1.5 trillion.\nAlthough most corporate pension funds, like\nother investor groups, invest mainly through\npartnerships, some of the largest funds have\n9.

These funds consider themselves\nsophisticated investors and tend to use advisers\nless than other investors do. They rely, instead,\non their own staff of experienced investment\nprofessionals to evaluate investment strategies\nand manage their investments. General partners\nin limited partnerships consider corporate pen\nsion funds valuable investors because their\ncommitment to a partnership often conveys\nto other potential limited partners a positive\nmessage about the quality of that partnership.\nExperienced corporate pension funds can\nsometimes exploit their ''lead'' investor status\nby negotiating slightly lower management fees\nor carried interest.\nA survey by The Private Equity Analyst of the\nfifty largest private pension funds that invest in\nprivate equity suggests that at the end of 1992\nthese funds, on average, had approximately\n4.3 percent of their assets allocated to private\nequity.105 The eight largest investors (table 10)\nhad allocations of between $500 million and more\nthan $2 billion, representing about 6 percent or\n7 percent of each fund's total assets.\nCorporate pension funds likely will to continue\nto invest in private equity as they receive distribu\ntions from previous investments, but the amount\nof commitments probably will not grow as quickly\nas the overall market. Contributing to the rela\ntively slower growth is the ongoing shift at many\ncorporations from defined benefit pension plans to\ndefined contribution pension plans, which gener\nally must invest in assets that are more liquid than\nprivate equity; defined benefit plans may also\nfocus more on liquid assets, owing to corporate\nrestructurings and other events that could increase\nlayoffs and early retirements.\nPublic Pension Funds\nPublic pension funds are relative newcomers to\nprivate equity investing. Over the course of the\n1980s, public pension fund commitments to\nprivate equity partnerships increased sharply, and\nin recent years they have displaced corporate\npension funds as the largest investor group\n(table 9). Like corporate pension funds, their\nmotive is almost purely financial; some, however,\n105.

The Private Equity Analyst.\nmay be under pressure to invest in firms in their\nown region.106\nPublic pension funds that invest in private\nequity are, on average, larger than corporate\npension funds that do so. As of 1991, the average\nassets of the ten largest public funds with private\nequity investments was $32.3 billion, while the\naverage size of the ten largest corporate funds was\n$21.3 billion.107 Although they are larger, public\npension funds operate under tighter budgets than\ntheir private counterparts and employ fewer invest\nment professionals. This combination of\ncharacteristics--limited staffs and large sums\nof capital to invest--has the effect of raising\nthe minimum investment size, in many cases to\nbetween $10 million and $25 million. Because\nthey generally operate under the additional\nconstraint that they not account for more than\n10 percent of the capital of a single partnership,\npublic pension funds tend to invest in larger\npartnerships.\nOwing to their nature, public pension funds and\ntheir investment decisions are likely to be held up\nto public scrutiny; indeed, elected officials often\n106. Both the California Public Employees Retirement\nSystem (CalPERS) and the Pennsylvania School Employee\nRetirement Program have recently initiated programs of direct\ninvestment in firms in their states. The programs are managed\nby private equity advisers.\n107. ''Public Funds Earmark $9.3 Billion for Investment in\nPrivate Equity,'' The Private Equity Analyst, February 1992.\n\nserve on fund boards of trustees and investment\ncommittees. The funds may be especially con\ncerned about the public's reaction to losses on\ninvestments that the public is unfamiliar with,\nsuch as private equity. They may also require\nevidence of satisfactory investment performance\non a more regular basis than is possible with\nprivate equity investments.108 As a result, public\npension funds tend to be somewhat more risk\naverse and to have shorter time horizons than\ncorporate pension funds. Although aversion to risk\nand illiquidity has not stopped public funds from\nbecoming a major investor group in the private\nequity market, it has influenced the types of\npartnerships in which public funds invest. In\nparticular, public pension funds apparently\nstrongly prefer later-stage venture and non-venture\npartnerships over early-stage venture partnerships\nbecause the former may be somewhat less risky\nand tend to generate returns more quickly.\nPublic pension funds tend to rely on outside\nadvisers to evaluate and ''certify'' potential\npartnership investments. They undertake fewer\ndirect investments and co-investments than\ncorporate funds, for several reasons. One is that\noutside advisers, on whom the funds rely, gener\nally do not evaluate potential direct investments.\nAlso, the lengthy process of reviewing investment\ndecisions limits the ability of public funds to\nrespond quickly to investment opportunities,\nwhich, market participants stress, is a key to\nsuccessful direct investing and co-investing.\nAccording to a Private Equity Analyst survey of\nthe fifty-six largest public pension funds investing\nin private equity, public funds, as of year-end\n1991, had allocated approximately 4.3 percent of\ntotal assets to private equity. Nine public pension\nfunds had allocations to private equity of between\n$800 million and $2 billion (table 10).\nEndowments and Foundations\nEndowments and foundations were among the\nearliest investors in venture capital. Most invest\nthrough partnerships, but some of the largest\nuniversity endowments also have active direct\ninvestment programs that were started in associa\ntion with research programs at their own universi\n108. The problem of performance measurement is exacer\nbated by the way some public funds measure internal rates of\nreturn on private equity partnerships. They do so strictly on a\ncash basis; thus, investments register large negative internal\nrates of return until distributions are made.\nties. Currently, they provide about 12 percent of\ntotal commitments to private equity partnerships\n(table 9).\nThe typical endowment or foundation is small\nrelative to pension funds, and only a few commit\nsubstantial amounts to private equity. Of the fifty\nlargest college and university endowments, only\nnine had nonmarketable investments of more than\n$60 million as of 1991 (the investment class\nincludes oil and gas partnerships as well as private\nequity partnerships).109 However, the three\nuniversity endowments with the largest private\nequity investments (table 10) had a total of more\nthan $1 billion in such investments. Overall,\nnonmarketable investments account for about\n5.3 percent of all financial assets managed by the\nfifty largest endowments. Little information is\navailable on private equity investments by founda\ntions and other types of endowments; however,\nsome of the larger foundations are reported to\nmake significant investments.110\nBank Holding Companies\nBank holding companies (BHCs) were also early\ninvestors in venture capital, and they are estimated\nto be the largest direct investors in the private\nequity market. Although they have, as a group,\nbeen active in private equity investing since the\n1960s, the specific BHCs involved have varied\nconsiderably, in many cases because the parent\nholding company lacks a strong commitment to\nsuch activity. Some of the BHCs with the largest\nprivate equity investments are relative newcomers,\nhaving entered the market when the affiliated\nbanks set up subsidiaries to manage equity\nreceived in exchange for developing country debt\nin the mid- to late 1980s. In addition, many BHCs\nhave become involved in the market to take\nadvantage of economies of scope between private\nequity investing and the provision of other\ncommercial bank products, especially loans: As\nlenders to small and middle-market companies,\nBHCs have contact with a large number of firms\nin which they might make private equity invest\nments; conversely, by investing in a private equity\npartnership, they may be able to generate lending\n109. See ''Endowments Moving into Limelight as Other\nInstitutions Withdraw,'' The Private Equity Analyst, August\n1992.\n110. See, for example, ''Ford Foundation Raises Venture\nCommitment,'' Venture Capital Journal, September 1993, p. 7;\nand ''Rockefeller Foundation Quickens Pace, Diversifies\nPortfolio,'' Venture Capital Journal, December 1994, p. 29.\n\nto portfolio companies in which the partnership\ninvests.111\nBecause their equity ownership of commercial\nenterprises is restricted, BHCs invest in private\nequity through separately capitalized bank holding\ncompany subsidiaries. Direct investments are made\nthrough licensed Small Business Investment\nCompanies (SBICs), and investments in limited\npartnerships are made through separate subsidi\naries. A Private Equity Analyst survey suggests\nthat of the twenty BHCs with the largest private\nequity investments, the five largest (table 10)\naccounted for two-thirds of the total.112\nWealthy Families and Individuals\nWealthy families and individuals still invest a\nsubstantial amount in private equity, but the\ngrowth of investment by pension funds and\nendowments has reduced this investor group's\nrelative importance in the market. In addition to\nthe wealthy families that were among the first\nventure capital investors, the group includes\nformer CEOs and executives recruited by partner\nships as limited partners for their business acumen\nas well as their money. The group also includes\nwealthy clients of commercial and investment\nbanks.113 According to market participants,\nwealthy individuals make commitments of\nbetween $50,000 and $1 million, amounts gener\nally smaller than commitments made by institu\ntional investors.\nLike the other groups, this investor group is\nattracted to private equity by its high returns.\nWealthy families and individuals may have longer\ntime horizons than investors in some other groups\nand thus may seem more suited to investing in\nilliquid assets such as private equity. Market par\nticipants also note that individuals seem to be\nmore willing to fund first-time partnerships.\nUnlike pension funds and endowments, which\nare tax exempt, wealthy families and individuals\nmay be affected by changes in tax codes. Market\nparticipants argue that the numerous changes in\n111. According to market participants, these economies may\nnot be exploited in practice because, for example, account\nofficers of commercial banks are not trained to identify good\nprivate equity clients. Further, a commercial bank is unlikely to\nbe a large enough investor in a fund to direct the lending\nbusiness toward itself.\n112.

For example, 25 percent of JP Morgan's $1 billion\nCorsair fund came from JPM's clients.\nthe capital gains tax since 1969 have affected\ninvestments by this investor group.\nInsurance Companies\nInsurance company involvement in the private\nequity market grew out of the companies' private\nplacement debt activities. For many years, insur\nance companies financed their riskier client firms\nby purchasing debt that had an equity feature.\nThey also provided mezzanine debt to finance\nsome of the earliest leveraged buyouts, before the\nemergence of the public junk bond market. As\nthey developed expertise, insurance companies,\nto generate deal flow for their mezzanine financing\nactivities, began investing in limited partnerships\ninvolved in the private equity market. Thus, some\ninsurance companies provided equity through a\nlimited partnership and directly provided mezza\nnine financing to the same firm. Through the early\n1980s, however, insurance companies restricted\nmost of their private equity activities to their own\nmezzanine financing, because of resistance to\n''blind pool'' investing associated with private\nequity partnerships. In addition, several insurance\ncompanies formed their own private equity\npartnerships to invest their own funds alongside\nmoney raised from outside investors. Since the\nmid-1980s, insurance company investments have\nbeen weighted more toward outside partnerships\nas insurance companies have become more\ncomfortable with partnership investing.\nInvestment Banks\nInvestment banks most often participate in the\nprivate equity market through partnerships in\nwhich they themselves serve as general partners.\nRaising partnerships became popular in the\nmid-1980s as part of merchant banking activities\nthat were aimed at providing financing and\nservices to assist large buyouts. It remains the case\ntoday that investment bank-sponsored partnerships\nare directed toward later-stage venture and non-\nventure investments in established companies, and\nthat financings by these partnerships share econo\nmies of scope with other investment banking\nservices. For example, an investment bank-\nsponsored partnership may make a bridge or\nmezzanine equity investment in a firm prior to its\ngoing public, in anticipation of the bank under\nwriting the IPO and providing other financial\nservices to the firm. In the case of large buyout\n\ntransactions, the investment bank may also provide\nunderwriting services and merger and acquisition\nadvice. Direct investment other than through the\npartnership is uncommon.\nNonfinancial Corporations\nNonfinancial corporations, like bank holding\ncompanies, were significant backers of venture\ncapital during the 1960s, often setting up special\nsubsidiaries to carry out these activities. Many\nnonfinancial companies remain active investors.\nVenture Economics estimated in 1993 that there\nare 73 corporate venturing programs. They invest\nmainly through their own direct venture capital\nprograms rather than through limited partnerships.\nNonfinancial corporations typically invest in\nrisky early-stage developmental ventures that may\nfit into their competitive and strategic objectives.\nAlmost three-quarters of the firms they invest in\nare in the medical and health care, industrial\nproducts and chemicals, and electronics and\ncommunications industries.114\nPrivate Equity Holdings\nof Major Investor Groups\nAs noted in chapter 2 and described in the\nappendix, we estimate that private equity capital\n114.

Corporate pension funds were the\nsecond largest investor group, with holdings of\nalmost $20 billion, followed by endowments and\nfoundations, with about $11 billion. The remaining\nprivate equity stock was divided about equally\nbetween financial institutions--bank holding\ncompanies, insurance companies, and investment\nbanks--and other investor groups.\n\n6. The Role of Agents and Advisers\nBecause of the market's rapid growth during the\n1980s and the entry of large numbers of new\npartnerships and investors, participants in the\nprivate equity market in many cases have not had\ndealings with one another. This lack of direct\nexperience has increased search and evaluation\ncosts for participants on both sides of the market.\nInvestors may have difficulty evaluating new\npartnerships, partnerships may not be familiar with\nthe decisionmaking processes of potential new\ninvestors, and firms seeking finance, though they\nmay have a larger pool of potential investors, may\nhave difficulty finding those willing to invest on\nthe most favorable terms. The situation has created\na market for agents and advisers, whose role is to\nmitigate these information problems.\nWe look at three major groups of agents and\nadvisers in the private equity market, defined by\nthe type of client they serve: Those that help\nportfolio firms raise private equity from limited\npartnerships or directly from institutional inves\ntors; those that help limited partnerships raise\nfunds from institutional investors; and those that\nadvise institutional investors on the placement of\nthe funds they have allocated to the private equity\nmarket. The number of agents and advisers in the\nlatter two groups has grown severalfold over the\npast decade, and the expanding market for their\nservices is one of the more dynamic aspects of the\nprivate equity market.\nAgents for Portfolio Firms\nAgents for portfolio firms help raise equity capital\nfrom limited partnerships or directly from institu\ntional investors, and negotiate terms with potential\ninvestors on behalf of portfolio firms. These\nagents, mainly investment and commercial banks,\nwere prominent in the deal-by-deal private equity\nfinancing that preceded the development of limited\npartnerships; with an increasing share of private\nequity funding going through limited partnerships,\nthey now play a more modest role. Agents are\nused most frequently by larger non-venture firms,\nin part because agent fees (as a percentage of\nissue size) decrease as the size of the issue\nincreases, making the use of an agent relatively\nmore expensive for smaller issuers, and also\nbecause larger firms are more likely to have\nestablished relationships with commercial and\ninvestment banks that provide agent services. No\nquantitative evidence is available, but remarks by\nmarket participants suggest that agents assist in\n20 percent to 35 percent of non-venture private\nequity issues.\nWhat Do Agents for Portfolio Firms Do?\nAgents for portfolio firms perform two functions.\nFirst, they provide search and evaluation services:\nThey identify firms that are potential candidates\nfor a private equity investment, compile informa\ntion about the firm, and distribute it to potential\ninvestors. Second, agents provide negotiating\nservices: They negotiate terms with potential\ninvestors on behalf of their client firms and use\ntheir knowledge of current market conditions to\nobtain better terms.\nSearch and Evaluation\nInvestment banks generate most of their private\nequity clients through relationship officers and\nequity analysts. Relationship officers obtain clients\nfrom a bank's existing client base in the course of\nreviewing a client's financing needs. Equity\nanalysts, by contrast, obtain clients in the course\nof searching for potential IPO candidates in the\nindustry in which they specialize. Among the\nfirms they evaluate they occasionally identify one\nthat is not quite ready to go public but has a need\nfor equity financing. Investment banks are keen to\nact as agents for such firms in hopes of underwrit\ning their IPOs in the future. Commercial banks\ngenerate a large number of leads from commercial\nloan officers, especially those involved in lending\nto small businesses.\nOnce a firm has been identified as a possible\ncandidate for a private equity issue, the agent\ndiscusses the advisability of such financing with\nthe firm. The managers of some firms know little,\nif anything, about the private equity market and\nneed information about the likely cost in terms of\nboth the price their shares might sell for and the\ninfluence investors will expect to exert over the\nfirm's general policies. Although many firms may\nregard the cost as high, many will have already\ntried and failed to secure other types of financing.\n\nAt this point, the agent conducts an initial\nevaluation of the firm's operating and financial\ncharacteristics to determine whether an offering\nwould be successful. This initial evaluation, which\nlasts three to five days, is critical to the agent's\nsuccess because agents are paid only a nominal\nretainer fee unless a private equity offering is\ncompleted successfully. If the evaluation is\nfavorable and the firm is comfortable with the\nidea of issuing private equity, the agent is given\na mandate to conduct further due diligence and\nto begin marketing the issue.\nHaving won an issuer's business, the agent\nbegins the labor-intensive process of compiling\ninformation about the firm and distributing it to\npotential investors. The first step is writing an\noffering memorandum--often called a ''book''--\nfor the firm. The book contains information on the\nnature of the firm's business, its financial and\noperating history, and its management gathered\nduring visits to and extensive discussions with\nmanagement. It also contains detailed five-year\nprojections of operating earnings, cash flows, and\nmarket valuation (based on standard multiples of\nforecast earnings before interest and taxes) and a\ndescription of the securities being offered and the\nintended use of the proceeds. The book often takes\nas long as six weeks to prepare and may be two\nhundred pages long. Because it is written for a\nprivate offering of securities, the book differs\nsomewhat from a prospectus issued for a public\noffering. In particular, it contains projections and\nforecasts, which are prohibited in descriptions of\npublic offerings.\nThe book is distributed to twenty to one\nhundred potential investors. Identifying potential\ninvestors is an important part of the agent's work.\nMost agents maintain a large database in which\npotential investors are listed by preference for\nindustry, location, type of securities, and stage\nof investment. The majority of potential investors\nare private equity limited partnerships, but a\nnumber of institutional investors, such as pension\nfunds and endowments, may also be on the\nagent's list. For some firms seeking private equity,\ncorporate buyers are also among the potential\ninvestors.115\nAfter the books are distributed, the agent and\nthe firm's senior managers typically prepare a\n115. Indeed, market participants indicate that corporate\nbuyers are often preferred over all other types of investors\nbecause they generally are willing to pay a higher price for the\nfirm, in anticipation of synergies between the two firms'\noperations.\n''road show'' and visit potential investors, one at\na time, to discuss the proposed offering in detail.\nThe visits are an opportunity for investors and\ninvestment advisers to question firm managers\nin detail about the contents of the offering\nmemorandum and to size up management quality\nand character. The road show typically goes to\ncities where investors are concentrated, such as\nNew York, Hartford, Boston, and Chicago, and\nmay last three or four weeks.\nNegotiation\nAfter the road show, interested investors often\nconduct additional due diligence before submitting\nterms sheets to the agent. These sheets state the\nterms under which the investor will invest,\nincluding price, the stake the investor will take\nat that price, covenants, and other terms, such\nas whether the investor will be the lead investor\nin the deal. The agent then negotiates with these\ninterested investors. Once the client is comfortable\nwith the terms of the bids, including the non-\nprice-related terms covering such matters as the\ncontrol the investor will have over the firm's\npolicies, a deal can be struck. The process of\nnegotiating price and non-price terms often takes\na month. Typically, fewer than half a dozen\ninvestors are in on the deal at the close, and in\nmany cases only one or two.\nPrivate equity deals typically take three months\nfrom start to finish, but more complicated issues\nmay take as long as a year. The considerable time\nand effort expended on behalf of the client is\nreflected in the agent's fee, which typically is\n5 percent to 6 percent of the gross funds raised.\nFees as a percentage of issue size increase as issue\nsize decreases, reflecting the agent's large fixed\ncosts. Fees for agents that match buyers and\nsellers but do not negotiate or place securities are\nsomewhat lower and may follow the Lehman\nformula.116 In general, agent fees are much higher\nthan those in the market for privately placed debt,\nwhich average less than 1 percent of issue size.\nThe charge for private equity is higher because\npotential equity investors need much more\ninformation than potential lenders when they\n116. The Lehman formula for calculating fees gives the\nagent a declining percentage for successive tranches of the\nissue, for example, 5 percent on the first $1 million issued,\n4 percent on the second, 3 percent on the third, 2 percent on\nthe fourth, and 1 percent on the remaining amount of the issue\nabove $4 million.\n\nevaluate investment opportunities.117 The typical\n11. Selected characteristics of major agents that\nprivate equity placement fee is generally some-\nplace private equity, 1992-93\nwhat lower than the 7 percent to 8 percent charged\nby an investment bank to underwrite an IPO, but\nthe investment bank also provides formal under\nwriting services, which are subject to market\nprice risks.\nAlthough private equity agents do not bear\nunderwriting risks, they do bear other risks. First,\napart from a small retainer fee paid by issuers at\nthe beginning of the process, agents are paid only\nfor successful placements; thus, their investment\nin a particular transaction in terms of staff time\nand other resources is at risk until closing. The\nagent's reputation with investors also is at risk:\nInvestors spend considerable time evaluating\noffering memorandums, and if they find those\nfrom a particular agent to be materially incomplete\nor inaccurate, they will be less likely in the future\nto evaluate offering memorandums from that\nagent. Agents control these risks through careful\nexamination of a client's business and financial\nstanding during the initial evaluation and the\nwriting of the offering memorandum.\nLimited partnerships and agents both overlap\nand compete in the services they provide to issuers\nof private equity. Indeed, competition between\nagents and limited partnerships in finding suitable\nportfolio firms appears to be intense. However,\nlimited partnerships, unlike agents, are investors\nthemselves and act on their own behalf, and thus\nthey are unlikely to share their knowledge of other\npotential investors or prevailing market conditions\nwith portfolio firms. Because they have less\ninformation, portfolio firms that issue equity\ndirectly to a limited partnership may obtain a\nlower price than they would have had they used\na formal agent; however, they recoup some of that\nloss by not having to pay a formal agent fee.\nWho Are the Agents for Portfolio Firms?\nAccording to a database supplied by Securities\nData Company (SDC), a total of 81 agents\narranged 256 private equity deals in 1992 and\n1993.118 Table 11 lists the top twenty agents in\n117. Lenders are interested mainly in a borrower's ability to\nservice the debt, whereas equity investors are concerned about\nthe growth potential of revenue and earnings.\n118. The numbers exclude agent-assisted fund raising for\nlimited partnerships and Rule 144A issues. Agent-assisted\nlimited partnership fund raising is discussed in the next section.\nAs discussed in chapter 1, we do not consider Rule 144A\nprivate equity issuers part of the private equity market.\nAgent\nNumber\nof deals\narranged\nTotal\ndeal\nvolume\n(millions\nof\ndollars)\nAverage\ndeal\nsize\n(millions\nof\ndollars)\nRank by\nnumber\nof\nIPOs\nunder\nwritten\nJP Morgan* ........\nDH Blair ............\nPaineWebber .......\nJosephthal ..........\nCS FirstBoston .....\nLehman .............\nDonaldson, Lufkin\nand Jenrette . . .\nKidder Peabody ....\nContinental* ........\nChase Manhattan* .\nGoldman, Sachs ....\nNatWest* ...........\nChemical* ..........\nSalomon ............\nMontgomery ........\nDean Witter ........\nMerrill Lynch ......\nSmith Barney .......\nVector ...............\nFirst Chicago* ......\n27.1\n. . .\n2.5\n. . .\n29.2\n3.0\n. . .\n1,267\n126.7\n63.8\n40.9\n31.4\n16.7\n. . .\n8.2\n. . .\n88.9\n30.5\n. . .\n15.0\n. . .\n27.6\n18.2\n16.6\n165.8\n27.8\n8.5\n. . .\n29.7\n. . .\n* Denotes commercial bank; all others are investment banks.\n. . .

These twenty agents accounted for\nalmost two-thirds of the deals arranged by agents\nand nearly four-fifths of the total volume arranged\nby agents; the top five arranged 26 percent of all\ndeals arranged by agents. Among agents that are\ncontinuously competing for clients the concentra\ntion is even higher, as a large number of agents\napparently operate in the market only infrequently.\nThe SDC database lists more than fifty firms that\nwere involved in only one or two deals during\n1992 and 1993.\nOf the top twenty agents, fourteen are invest\nment banks. The predominance of investment\nbanks is consistent with the notion that there are\nsignificant economies of scope between arranging\nprivate equity issues and other investment banking\nactivities, such as underwriting public equity\nissues (particularly IPOs). These economies of\nscope appear to be focused in the prospecting\nstage of the agenting business: Investment banks\nThe SDC data are likely very incomplete. In particular, the\ntotal number of deals arranged by agents is unknown because\nmany small agents do not report their transactions to SDC.\n\nthat develop relationships with small firms by\nacting as agents for their private equity issues may\nbe more likely to be chosen by the firm to\nunderwrite any future public offerings of securi\nties. Indirect evidence of these economies of scope\ncan be seen in the rankings of the top twenty\nprivate equity agents according to number of IPOs\nunderwritten: Of the fourteen investment banks\namong the top twenty private equity agents, eleven\nare also among the top twenty IPO underwriters.\nThe remaining top twenty private equity agents\nare commercial banks. Their presence on the top-\ntwenty list may also reflect some economies of\nscope, in this case between arranging private\nequity issues and providing loans to small busi\nnesses. Commercial banks that have substantial\nsmall-business-loan operations are likely to come\ninto contact with a large number of firms that are\npotential candidates for private equity issues and\ncan take advantage of their contacts by having a\nprivate-equity-agenting operation.\nAgents appear to vary widely in the size of\nprivate equity deals in which they specialize,\nreflecting the wide variation in the size of firms\nthat issue in the private equity market. Among the\ntop agents, some--such as JP Morgan, DH Blair,\nPaine Webber, and Josephthal--specialize in small\nissues (less than $50 million) by smaller firms,\nwhile a number of the larger investment banks--\nsuch as CS First Boston, Goldman Sachs, and\nMerrill Lynch--specialize in large deals.\nAgents for Limited Partnerships\nA different set of agents help limited partnerships\nraise funds. Although most limited partnerships\ndo not use agents to raise funds, those that are\nattempting to raise very large sums ($1 billion or\nmore), that have no track record, or that specialize\nin investments that are less familiar to institutional\ninvestors than traditional venture capital investing\noften turn to agents for help. Agents' activities in\nthis sector of the market are thus naturally\nconfined to large partnerships that are dedicated\nto non-venture investments such as buyouts and\ndistressed debt. Such partnerships often target as\nprincipal investors public pension funds. The\ndecisionmaking process at public pension funds\ninvolves investment officers, trustees, and pension\nadvisers (''gatekeepers''), and relationships with\nthese individuals must be carefully developed.\nThus, even a limited partnership that has experi\nenced and well-respected general partners may\nprefer to take advantage of an agent's contacts and\nexperience in raising money from large pension\nfunds rather than do the fund raising itself. Some\npartnerships may also use agents for fund raising\nsimply to avoid diverting the general partners'\ntime from investment activities.\nAgents are rarely used to raise money for\ntraditional venture capital partnerships whose\ngeneral partners have an established track record.\nIndeed, market participants observe that potential\ninvestors would not look favorably on general\npartners using an agent to raise money for a\nfollow-on fund, as such a move would indicate\nthat they were having trouble raising money from\ninvestors in earlier funds.\nAgents for limited partnerships are a fairly\nrecent phenomenon. Before 1985 there were only\nfive established limited partnership agents. Since\nthen the number of agents has more than tripled,\nto sixteen in 1994.119 Of these, seven have each\nhelped raise more than $1 billion of private equity\nfor partnerships.\nAgents for partnerships perform activities\nsimilar to those performed by agents on behalf of\nportfolio firms, though they do not need to put\nmuch effort into looking for clients because they\nregularly receive a large number of proposals from\nlimited partnerships that are looking for help in\nraising money. They provide extensive evaluation\n(or certification) services for potential investors.\nBecause their success appears to rest critically on\na reputation among institutional investors for\nconsistently bringing them high-quality offerings,\nthey are very selective about which funds they\nraise money for.120 Once they have agreed to\nassist a particular partnership, agents prepare the\noffering memorandum for the fund and distribute\nit to potential investors, organize a road show, and\nconduct one-on-one meetings with potential\ninvestors. On average, partnership funds take\naround nine months to raise. Drawing on their\nknowledge of current market conditions, agents for\npartnerships also negotiate terms on behalf of\nfunds.\nAgents for limited partnerships charge high\nfees, reflecting the specialized nature of the task\nof raising money from public pension funds and\nperhaps the limited number of agents that compete\nin this market. The current rate appears to be\nabout 2 percent of funds raised and a carried\n119. See ''Placement Agents Multiply as Market for Funds\nSwells,'' The Private Equity Analyst, April 1994.\n120. One agent we talked to receives as many as five\nproposals a week but chooses to raise money for only four or\nfive partnership funds a year.\n\ninterest in the partnership. Thus, an agent's fees\non a $1 billion fund, not counting the carried\ninterest, may amount to $20 million. Attracted\nby such returns, several investment banks have\nrecently created fund-raising groups. Market\nparticipants expect the market to become more\ncompetitive as a result of these new entrants. They\nexpect the role of fund-raising agents to diminish\nsomewhat over the longer term as public pension\nfunds become more familiar with the market and\nas the large limited partnerships become more\nfamiliar with the individuals who have discretion\nary power over the pension fund assets that are\nallocated to private equity.\nAdvisers to Institutional Investors\nAdvisers to institutional investors make up the\nfinal group of agents in the private equity market.\nAdvisers specialize in evaluating and recommend\ning partnership investments for institutional\ninvestors, but they evaluate some co-investment\nopportunities in portfolio firms as well. Advisers\nhave a somewhat longer history than do agents for\nlimited partnerships, some having been advising\ninstitutional investors on the placement of their\nfunds among venture capital partnerships since the\nearly 1970s. In 1985, nine such advisers were in\noperation. As the number of institutional investors\nthat allocate capital to the private equity market\nhas grown, so too has the number of advisers. In\n1994, twenty-six advisory firms were in operation;\nin the 1990s alone, ten new firms entered the\nfield.121\nAdvisers' major clients are pension funds,\nendowments, and foundations. These institutions\nvalue the services provided by advisers mainly\nbecause they either have little experience in\ninvesting in the private equity market and need\nsome guidance or do not have the staff resources\nto adequately evaluate investment opportunities.\nIn 1994, the twenty-six advisory firms had discre\ntionary power over at least $9.7 billion and non\ndiscretionary power over another $8.6 billion.122\nThe structure of an advisory firm varies. Some\noperate within a full-service money management\nfirm, while others are independent. Advisers in\nthe former group tend to have discretionary power\nover assets, while those in the latter do not.\nIncreasingly, advisory firms operate as a ''fund\n121. See ''As Competition Increases, Gatekeepers Expand\nRange of Services,'' The Private Equity Analyst, October 1994.\n122. Ibid.\nof funds'' in which advisers function as general\npartners of a limited partnership that invests in\nother limited partnerships. Of the twenty-six\nadvisory firms operating in 1994, nine operated\na fund of funds and another five were in the\nprocess of raising their first fund of funds.\nBecause advisers direct, or influence the\ndirection of, such large sums of money, they\nroutinely receive a large number of offering\nmemorandums from private partnerships that are\nin the process of raising funds. Thus, like agents\nfor limited partnerships, they need not expend\nmany resources to find investment opportunities\nbut do perform extensive screening and evaluation\nservices for their clients.\nTheir screening and evaluation involve exten\nsive review of the partnership managers' track\nrecord: Advisers typically request the audited\nfinancial statements of all of the partnership\nmanagers' previous partnerships and a large\namount of supplemental information, including\nthe cash flows from each of the investments in\nthe managers' previous partnerships. From this\ninformation, rates of return for each investment\nare calculated and used to verify the previous\npartnerships' overall rates of return.123 Information\nis also obtained on the region and industry of each\ninvestment, the percent ownership held by the\npartnerships in each portfolio company, the\nnumber of board seats held by the partnerships,\nand other investment characteristics. From this\ninformation the advisory firm attempts to infer\nwhether the managers' previous record reflects\npredominantly skill or luck. For example, if a\npartnership is raising a new fund to invest in the\nhealth care industry and the general partners tout\ntheir expertise in this industry, the advisory firm\ninvestigates whether earlier health care invest\nments were successful. Similarly, if partnership\nmanagers attribute their earlier successes to their\npositive influence, through board seats, on the\noperations of the partnership's portfolio compa\nnies, the advisory firm investigates whether there\nis a positive correlation between returns on earlier\ninvestments and the number (or percentage) of\nboard seats held.\n123. Although partnerships of all types are evaluated in\nbasically the same way, partnerships dedicated to non-venture\ninvestments, especially those that are only several years old,\ncan be more difficult to evaluate because there often are not\nsubsequent rounds of financing upon which to establish new\ninvestment values. Advisory firms sometimes compare the\nvaluation assumptions used by different partnership manage\nment firms to determine whether a particular set of assumptions\nis reasonable.\n\nThe organizational structure and incentives\nwithin the proposed partnership are also examined.\nOf critical importance is whether the general\npartners who generated the past returns are still\nwith the partnership. Also of interest are compen\nsation arrangements. Arrangements that insuffi\nciently compensate younger general partners who\nare expected to carry the workload, for example,\nmay signal future problems. Some advisers are\nconcerned with whether a partnership is affiliated\nwith an institution and, if so, whether the general\npartners' compensation is tied to the performance\nof the fund or is a drawn salary.\nAnother focus of attention is partnership size.\nSome growth over the managers' previous partner\nships is normal and can be justified if the number\nof general partners has increased, if the partner\nship is taking larger stakes in the companies in\nwhich it invests, or if the partnership is syndicat\ning fewer deals. However, advisory firms are alert\nfor situations in which the partnership may be\ninvesting in more projects than the general\npartners can effectively monitor. Of a more subtle\nnature, having a greater amount under manage\nment may simply result in higher valuations on the\ninitial investments: When an issuer knows that a\npartnership has a large amount to invest, it may\nbe able to negotiate a more favorable price.\nAdvisers also typically provide negotiation\nservices for their clients. They evaluate the terms\nof the offering (such provisions as general partner\nfees and rules regarding the calculation of carried\ninterest) in the context of current market condi\ntions. In deciding whether to recommend investing\nin the partnership, the advisory firm takes into\naccount other partnership investment opportunities\nthat might arise in the near future; it may recom\nmend against investing in a partnership that\nappears fairly attractive, for example, if it knows\nthat an outstanding partnership will be raising\nfunds in six months.\nUntil a few years ago, the standard annual fee\ncharged for advisory services was 1 percent of\nassets under discretionary management. However,\npricing has come under pressure from new\nentrants to the field, and fees today are generally\nbetween 50 and 70 basis points, and sometimes\nlower. Increased competition has also forced many\nadvisory groups to expand the range of services\nthey provide to their clients. New services include\nevaluating international limited partnership\nofferings, direct investments in portfolio firms, and\nsecondary offerings of limited partnership inter\nests. Advisory firms have also expanded into\nadvising institutional investors on managing the\nsecurities that are distributed by limited partner\nships. This activity has been spurred by the\ngrowing volume of stock distributions as partner\nships are maturing and winding down. Many\ninvestors, lacking the expertise or resources to\nevaluate these securities, direct the partnership to\ndistribute the securities to an advisory firm, which\nthen decides whether the investor should hold,\nsell, or even purchase additional shares, a service\nthat shares scope economies with money managers\nthat specialize in small-capitalization stocks.\n\n7. The Returns on Private Equity Investments and their Determinants\nA major reason for the explosive growth of the\nprivate equity market since 1980 has been the\nanticipation by institutional investors of returns\nsubstantially higher than can be earned in alterna\ntive markets. Of course, private equity investments\nare regarded as substantially more risky and more\nilliquid than other assets. For those institutional\ninvestors that can bear such risk and illiquidity,\nhowever, the high expected returns are a major\nattraction. In this chapter we use publicly available\ndata on the returns to the limited partners of\nprivate equity limited partnerships to examine\nreturns to private equity over the past two\ndecades.\nThe data indicate that returns to private equity\nhave at times substantially exceeded returns in the\npublic market. To a certain extent, returns are\ndriven by capital availability: For both venture\nand non-venture investments, returns have been\ngreatest on investments made during periods when\nrelatively small amounts of capital were available,\nthough other factors can also explain the high\nreturns during these periods. Conversely, there is\nconcern, if not a large amount of evidence, that\nperiods of greater capital availability depress\nfuture returns. The data also indicate that returns\ngenerally have been higher for non-venture and\nlater-stage venture capital partnerships than for\nearly-stage partnerships, a pattern that may partly\nexplain the faster growth of the later-stage and,\nparticularly, non-venture sectors of the private\nequity market over the past fifteen years.\nData from Venture Economics\nThe most comprehensive information on returns\nto venture and non-venture partnerships is avail\nable from the commercial firm Venture Economics\nInvestor Services, which provides summary\ninformation on returns to limited partners in\norganized venture capital partnerships formed in\n1969-89 and in organized non-venture partner\nships formed in 1980-89. Returns are measured\nby the internal rate of return (IRR).124 IRRs for\neach partnership are based on capital contributions\n124. Venture Economics constructs internal rates of return\nusing cash flow information from the audited financial state\nments of partnerships provided to Venture Economics by\npartnership management companies and limited partners.\n(negative cash flows), distributions to limited\npartners (positive cash flows), and a valuation of\nthe assets that remain in the partnership (terminal\nvalue). Distributions to limited partners, and hence\nIRRs, are net of management fees and other\npartnership expenses. We present a capitalization-\nweighted IRR, which weights the partnership IRR\nby the size of the partnership, as well as a median\nIRR.\nIt should be noted that returns to partnerships\nthat have not yet been liquidated--a group that\nincludes the majority of partnerships formed since\n1980--reflect the valuation of a residual compo\nnent comprising investments whose market values\nare unknown but are often reported at cost. The\ninclusion of such a valuation presents less of a\nproblem for funds formed in the early 1980s,\nwhich have a relatively low residual value compo\nnent, than for funds formed in the late 1980s.\nEven for the younger funds, however, the\n''interim'' IRRs reported may still be good\nindicators of final IRRs, particularly given that the\nIPO market in 1991-93 was hot, allowing for\nsuccessful exits by some of the more promising\nportfolio companies.\nReturns data are reported separately for three\ngroups of funds: 30 venture capital partnerships\nformed between 1969 and 1982 that had been\nliquidated by year-end 1993; 351 venture capital\npartnerships at least four years old and still in\nexistence at year-end 1993; and 86 active non-\nventure equity partnerships formed between 1980\nand 1989.125\nIRRs of Liquidated Funds\nDespite a partnership's scheduled life of ten years,\nonly 30 of 139 venture capital partnerships formed\nbetween 1969 and 1982 in Venture Economics's\nsample had been liquidated by year-end 1993.126\nOf these, twelve were formed during 1969-75,\n125. The venture funds together accounted for $18.8 billion\nof the estimated total of $23.6 billion raised by venture capital\nlimited partnerships over 1969-89; the non-venture funds\naccounted for only 36 percent of the estimated non-venture\npartnership universe.\n126. Most of these funds were dissolved between years 10\nand 14, with a range of 8 to 19. At least one fund formed\nduring 1969-75 is still outstanding and continues to invest\nrealized gains.\n\n12.

The\nlatter were dragged down by six funds formed\nduring 1982 that had an average IRR of only\n1.6 percent.\nWith the exception of the partnerships formed\nin 1982, limited partners in these venture capital\npartnerships earned returns that substantially\nexceeded those in the public equity market. For\nexample, whereas the IRRs on venture capital\npartnerships formed during 1976-79 averaged\nnearly 30 percent, the average annual return on\na portfolio of small-company stocks over the\nten-year period 1979-88 was approximately\n18.9 percent.127\nThis group of liquidated partnerships, especially\nthose raised before 1980, were formed at a time\nwhen general partners were highly selective,\nfinancing only start-up firms with the most\npromising growth prospects--those expected to\ngrow to more than $20 million in annual sales.\nAlthough partnerships formed in both the early\nand late 1970s benefited from this selectivity,\npartnerships formed in the latter period were able\nto exit investments more quickly (through the hot\nIPO markets of 1981 and 1983) and thus showed\neven higher returns. The experience of the 1970s\n127. Ibbotson (1994). Partnerships formed during 1976-79\ninvested most of their capital during 1976-82, with peak\ninvestment likely occurring between 1979 and 1981. Most\nof their distributions had occurred by 1988. Thus, 1979-88\ncorresponds to the period during which partnerships earned\nreturns on most of their capital.\nshows that, at times, private equity offers returns\nthat substantially exceed those available from\npublicly traded securities.\nIRRs as of 1993\nof Active Venture Capital Partnerships\nThe preceding section examined the returns to\nliquidated partnerships. A much larger number\nof venture capital partnerships are still active.\nAs of 1993, the capitalization-weighted average\nIRR of 351 active venture capital partnerships\nformed during the 1980s was 9.4 percent\n(table 13).128 The median IRR was only 6.3 per\ncent, with a lower-quartile rate of -0.3 percent and\nan upper-quartile rate of 12.5 percent. The residual\nvalue as a proportion of total value is large--\nalmost 50 percent--reflecting the long investment\nperiods for private equity. To the extent that\nresidual value is biased downward because some\ninvestments are recorded at cost and because\ninvestments exited through the public market are\ndiscounted 20 percent to 30 percent, total returns\nare underestimated.129\nReturns to active partnerships formed during the\n1980s were substantially lower than returns to\npartnerships formed during the 1970s. Judged\nagainst the returns on publicly traded small stocks,\nhowever, the returns do not seem quite so low.\nFor example, the returns on small stocks over\nthe ten year period 1984-93 averaged only\n10 percent.130\nIRRs as of 1993 by Year of Formation\nLike the partnerships formed during the 1970s, the\nsixteen partnerships formed during 1980 and still\nactive had a capitalization-weighted average IRR\nas of 1993 of nearly 20 percent (table 13). Returns\nfor partnerships formed after 1980 were sharply\nlower; for example, capitalization-weighted\naverage IRRs for active partnerships formed\nbetween 1981 and 1984 were in the mid-single\n128. IRRs for an additional sixty partnerships raised during\n1990-93 are not included in the data because the partnerships\nare less than four years old and very few of their investments\nhave been exited.\n129. Partnerships generally discount the value of assets\nexited through the public market because they do not believe\nthey could sell their substantial stakes in these firms without\ndepressing the price.\n130. Again, we choose the period over which we measure\nreturns on publicly issued stock to conform to those years\nduring which the partnerships earned their returns.\n\n13.

Although these partnerships still have\ninvestments that have not been liquidated, their\nfinal IRRs will not differ significantly from their\nIRRs as of 1993 unless the remaining assets are\nsold for substantially more than their current book\nvalue--an unlikely scenario, as many of these\ninvestments are more than ten years old.

Further, the larger funds were\nmore likely to have been formed in the late 1980s,\nmaking it difficult to distinguish the effects of size\nand other factors that may have led to higher\nreturns on funds formed during this period. If\nin fact the observed differences represent a true\nsuperiority of returns to larger and later-stage\npartnerships over this period, one explanation may\nbe that these partnerships represent follow-on\nfunds raised by experienced general partners,\nwhereas smaller and early-stage funds are\nmanaged by less-experienced general partners.\nIRRs as of 1993 of Active Non-Venture\nCapital Partnerships\nAs of 1993, the capitalization-weighted average\nIRR for Venture Economics's sample of eighty-six\nactive non-venture private equity partnerships\nformed during the 1980s was 14.4 percent (table\n15).131 The median IRR was 11.2 percent, and the\nIRRs for the lower-quartile and the upper-quartile\n131.

Capitalization-weighted average IRRs for\nfunds formed through 1986 exceeded the com\nposite average of 14.4 percent, while those for\nfunds formed after 1986 were below the average.\nThe decline in rates of return is consistent with\nstudies that find that LBOs undertaken during the\nlate 1980s underperformed those undertaken in the\nearly 1980s (see Kaplan and Stein, 1993). The\nlower returns on the later deals have been attrib\nuted to breakdowns in both buyout pricing and\nstructure.\nDeterminants of Private Equity Returns\nThe highest returns to venture capital partnerships\nwere those to partnerships formed during periods\nwhen small amounts of capital were raised\n(chart 6). For example, returns to venture capital\npartnerships formed during the late 1970s, when\nlittle capital was raised, were relatively high.\nConversely, returns to partnerships formed during\nthe early 1980s, when greater amounts of capital\nwere raised, fell to single digits. The pattern of\nreturns for non-venture partnerships is similar:\nNon-venture partnerships formed during the early\n6.

As discussed\npreviously, general partners of venture capital\npartnerships were very selective in the mid-1970s\nabout their investments in new ventures out of\nconcern that only firms that grew to a certain size\ncould be taken public. The development of new\ninvestment strategies--for example, non-venture\ninvestments by venture capital partnerships in the\n1970s (see chapter 2)--also temporarily boosted\nreturns. A more striking example were the\nleveraged buyouts of public companies, such as\nGibson Greetings, by non-venture partnerships in\nthe early 1980s.132\n132. Gibson Greetings was taken private in January 1982\nat a purchase price of $80 million. Sixteen months later the\ncompany was taken public at a value of $290 million. The\npartnership backing the deal--Wesray, headed by former\ntreasury secretary William Simon--earned a profit of $210 mil\nlion on an equity investment of only $1 million.\n\nMarket participants are concerned that returns\nto partnerships formed during periods of high\ncommitments, such as 1994, will fall below the\nlevel needed to compensate investors for the risk\nand illiquidity of private equity investments. For\nvarious reasons, greater capital availability could\nlead to a breakdown in discipline in deal pricing\nand structuring and, hence, to lower returns.\nDuring periods of high commitments, the competi\ntion for locating deals intensifies, and deals that\nare found may also have been found by other\npartnerships eager to invest. This intense competi\ntion makes it more likely that general partners will\npay a higher price to reduce the risk of losing the\ndeal. Thus, under conditions of intensified compe\ntition for a limited supply of investment opportuni\nties, the incentive to put capital to work may\noutweigh the incentive to invest in only fairly\npriced deals.\nIn conjunction with the possible incentive to\nmake overpriced investments, general partners\nmay have less information on which to base\nvaluations during periods of intensified competi\ntion because deals close more quickly than usual.\nThe quick closure does not allow time for suffi\ncient due diligence and careful deal structuring,\nwhich are considered the heart of private equity\ninvesting, increasing the likelihood of investing\nin ventures that yield lower returns.\nFinally, when commitments to partnerships are\nample, less experienced general partners manage\nlarger amounts of capital. These general partners\nmay have both fewer concerns about reputation\nand less ability, making them especially likely\nto overpay for deals, and by greater amounts.\nGiven that periods of high commitments could\nbe associated with lower returns, why would\nlimited partners commit capital at times when\nother limited partners are also investing large\namounts? One explanation is that the high level\nof commitments is triggered by favorable exit\nconditions, such as a hot IPO market or a robust\nmergers and acquisitions market, which substan\ntially increases returns on earlier partnerships.\nSuch periods, especially those associated with hot\nIPO markets, produce returns to private equity that\nare not only high for this asset class, but also high\ncompared with returns on other assets.133 There is\nevidence that even in the public market investors\n133. A study by Venture Economics of 442 investments\nmade over 1970-82 shows that gains realized through IPOs\nwere five times greater than gains realized through private\nsales. See ''Exiting Venture Capital Investments,'' Venture\nCapital Journal, October 1988.\nallocate funds on the basis of recent performance\n(see Lakonishok, Shleifer, and Vishny, 1992). In\nthe case of private equity investments, the pattern\nof allocating funds to private equity on the basis\nof recent performance may be amplified by other\nfactors: When exit conditions are favorable,\ninvestors receive distributions in cash or stock,\nreducing some uncertainty about returns; returns\nreported at this time provide new information\nabout the valuation of existing assets. General\npartners, recognizing that limited partners are\nmore inclined to invest when exit conditions are\ngood, may time their fund raising accordingly.\nBeing approached by general partners, in turn,\ngives limited partners another reason to invest,\nas the opportunity to invest with any specific set\nof general partners comes only once every three\nto five years.\nOutlook for Future Returns\nCapital commitments to both venture and non-\nventure partnerships reached new highs in 1994.\nThe increase followed higher reported returns to\nprivate equity, which got a lift from the receptive\nIPO market in 1991-93. Lagging returns to public\nequity may also have prompted some investors to\nreallocate funds to private equity.\nThe high levels of commitments raises the\nquestion of whether low returns will follow. The\nrisks arising from greater capital availability are\napparent to market participants, as evidenced by\nthe frequent reporting of investment activity and\ndeal prices.134 At least one major public pension\nfund abruptly curtailed its commitments to\nnon-venture partnerships as result of the apparent\nsurplus of capital, and general partners have\nreportedly detected heightened caution among\nother investors.135 If more institutional investors\nallocate investment funds to private equity on the\nbasis of factors other than recent performance, the\nrisk of a cycle of high commitments followed by\nlower returns will decrease. Moreover, to the\nextent that general partners continue to develop\nnew investment strategies, competition for deals is\nreduced, making it less likely that general partners\nwill invest in overpriced deals.\n134. See, for example, ''Buy-out Funds Put Money To Work\nat Steady Pace, Despite Big Inflow,'' The Private Equity\nAnalyst, March 1995, and ''Pricing Discipline Appears To\nWeaken in Venture Market,'' The Private Equity Analyst,\nApril 1995.\n135. See ''Oregon Steps Back from Alternatives,'' Venture\nCapital Journal, December 1994.\n\nThe way private equity returns evolve over\nthe longer term will depend, we believe, on the\nrelative importance of two secular influences\non returns. One is the degree to which limited\npartners move up the learning curve in terms of\nselecting and funding partnerships and negotiating\nterms with general partners. Today's private equity\nmarket is still not very mature: Many institutional\ninvestors have been dealing with the limited\npartnership, a fairly complex organizational\nstructure, for little more than ten years. Market\nparticipants note that as investors have gained\nexperience, they have become much more sophis\nticated in their performance of these functions.\nMoreover, limited partners now have greater\naccess to independent advisers. These develop\nments should benefit institutional investors in\nterms of the returns on their private equity\ninvestments.\nThe second secular influence on future returns\nis the degree to which the private equity market\nbecomes more efficient, less risky, and less illiquid\nin the future. The expected returns investors earn\nin this market are intended to compensate them\nfor illiquidity and greater risk. As the market\ndevelops, however, and investors are able to make\ninvestments through a greater number of part\nnerships, idiosyncratic risks will be diversified\naway. Further, development of a secondary\nmarket for partnership interests, though limited\nto date, could reduce somewhat the liquidity\npremium.\n\nAppendix. Estimation of Private Equity Capital\nThis appendix presents an estimate of the total\namount of capital held by the professionally\nmanaged private equity market at the end of 1994,\nboth commitments to limited partnerships and\ndirect investments.\nBasic Estimation Method\nThe total amount of capital held was estimated\nby summing the estimated amounts contributed\nby each investor group. To estimate capital held\nin limited partnerships, we began with data on\ncumulative commitments to partnerships by each\ninvestor group during 1986-94, as reported by the\nThe Private Equity Analyst (PEA), and then\nadjusted the amount down 25 percent to reflect\nthat some capital had been returned to investors\nas investments were exited.136 Our adjustment was\nbased on PEA surveys of corporate and public\npension fund holdings of private equity as of\n1992; the ratio of pension fund holdings of limited\npartnership interests at the end of 1992 to cumula\ntive commitments by pension funds to limited\npartnerships over 1986-92 was 0.75.137\nOur estimate of direct investment by each\ninvestor group made use of qualitative information\nabout the investment process typical of the group.\nGenerally, for investor groups in which a few\nlarge investors have direct investment or active\nco-investment programs, such as corporate pension\nfunds, we assumed that 80 percent of the total\ncapital committed to private equity by the group\nwas through limited partnerships and 20 percent\nwas through direct investments and co-investments\n(table A.1).138 For the most experienced investors,\nsuch as bank holding companies, we assumed that\n60 percent of their private equity capital was\ninvested directly. For the other investor groups,\nsuch as public pension funds and investment\n136. We assumed that all capital committed to partnerships\nbefore 1986 had been returned to investors.\n137. This adjustment assumed that 75 percent of new\ncommitments in 1993-94 represented net additions to partner\nships.\n138.

Of that amount,\n$81.6 billion was invested through limited partner\nships and $18.8 billion was invested directly.\nVenture Economics estimates that venture\ncapital outstanding at year-end 1994 was\n$34.1 billion--a figure that likely overstates\nventure capital investment because several of the\nlarger venture capital partnerships that Venture\nEconomics tracks have shifted toward mainly\nnon-venture investments. Alternatively, commit\nments to venture capital partnerships accounted for\n26 percent of commitments to all private equity\npartnerships during 1980-94 (see chart 2), imply\ning venture capital outstanding of $26 billion--\n\na figure that likely understates venture capital\ninvestment because commitments to such partner\nships are likely to be distributed less quickly than\ncommitments to non-venture partnerships owing\nto the longer time horizons of venture capital\ninvestments. We pick the midpoint to approximate\nventure capital holdings--$30 billion--leaving\n$70 billion allocated to non-venture capital.\n\nReferences\nBaker, George P., and Karen H. Wruck.

      "content": "TORT LAW IN A PEANUT\nJohn L. Akula\nCopyrighted by John L. Akula\n[Note: This Peanut provides a brief, non-technical introduction to a complex area of the\nlaw. In the interest of brevity, generalizations are made without the qualifications needed\nto make them accurate. This Peanut is intended for use as an instructional aid, and does\nnot replace the advice of an attorney.]\nI. PRIVATE AND PUBLIC LAW\nOne of the distinctive characteristics of the legal systems associated with Western\nsocieties is the extensiveness of \"PRIVATE LAW\". Private law is law that regulates the\nrights and duties of private citizens and institutions towards one another, in contrast to\n\"PUBLIC LAW\", which concerns itself with government and the relationship of private\ncitizens and institutions to government.\nWhile there are no rigid divisions between private and public law, or within the\nsystem of private law, there are several distinctive bodies of doctrine representing the\nmajor threads in the private law system. Probably the two most important bodies of\nprivate law for relationships outside the family (FAMILY LAW and the related law of\ninheritance are also major threads in private law) are the law of \"TORTS\" and the law of\n\"CONTRACTS\". A century ago, the law of PROPERTY, another body of private law,\nwould probably have been ranked as high as tort law or contract law, but the importance\nof property law has declined with the decline of the significance of rights in \"real\nproperty\" (i.e., land and buildings) for general social ordering.\nII. TORTS AND CONTRACTS COMPARED\nA basic understanding of the roles of tort and contract law can be gained by\ncontrasting them.\nTHE LAW OF CONTRACTS.\nContract law is concerned primarily with the ways in which private agreements or\n\"deals\" will be enforced, especially in commercial settings. The paradigmatic \"contract\" is\na deal between two parties, in which there is an AGREEMENT (sometimes called a\n\"MEETING OF THE MINDS\") between the PARTIES, who voluntarily agree to exchange\nwith one another some form of VALUE (sometimes called \"CONSIDERATION\"), which is\n\ntypically money, property, services, or promises. Complex arrangements are typically in\nthe form of a WRITTEN CONTRACT. There are certain contractual FORMALITIES,\nsuch as the signing of a contract (or the \"handshake\" in simpler deals), which provide\nparties with a clear decision point on whether to enter the deal and also provide\nunambiguous evidence of the intent of the parties to be bound.\nContracts are thus typically entered into voluntarily, and reflect the preferences of\nthe individuals involved. Because of the broad individual autonomy recognized by contract\nlaw, this system is often said to embody the principle of FREEDOM OF CONTRACT. It\nis typically considered ethical for each of the parties to a commercial contract to bargain\nhard for his own interests, and the extent to which the law of contracts is used as an\nordering principle for certain relationships often reflects society's level of comfort with\nself-interested behavior in those relationships. Contractual relationships are at the heart of\nwhat economists call \"free markets\".\nContract law can apply outside of commercial arrangements, but typically subject\nto qualifications. (For example, the marriage relationship has some contractual aspects,\nbut most of the terms of the \"deal\" are set by law, and not open to the parties to negotiate.)\nEven in commercial settings, the parties to a contract do not have the power to create a\nlegally binding arrangement on any terms they decide. Contracts may not be contrary to\nPUBLIC POLICY, and in many arenas the permissible terms of contracts are quite closely\nregulated, especially where it is felt that untrammelled freedom of contract is likely to\nresult in exploitative relationships. For example, most states specify many of the terms\nthat must be included in life or health insurance policies.\nContracts represent private law in the sense that the law will enforce them. For\nexample, if you put a down payment on a car and the car dealer promises to hold it for you,\nbut later refuses to let you buy the car, you can go to court, and a court will normally treat\nthe contract as legally binding. The dealer would be said to have BREACHED or\nDEFAULTED on the contract, and you would be the non-defaulting party.\nFurthermore, the law as enforced by the courts, and not the parties themselves,\ndetermine what RELIEF will be granted to the non-defaulting party against the defaulting\nparty. Typically, a court will grant DAMAGES, which is a money award. The rules on\ndamages are quite complex, but the central idea is typically to put the non-defaulting party\nin as good a position financially as he or she would have been in had the deal gone through.\nIn pure commercial relationships, there is generally no \"punitive\"element to contract\ndamages. It is not considered \"wrong\" to breach a contract: each party has the option of\neither performing or paying damages.\nTHE LAW OF TORTS.\nIf contracts is the law of deals, torts is the law of duties. The law of torts is much\nmore internally diverse than the law of contracts, but the central idea is that people have\ncertain interests which others have the obligation or duty to respect. The existence of these\n\ninterests and the duty of others to respect them do not depend upon promises or\nagreements: they are broader-gauged social obligations. With respect to many such\ninterests, the violation of the duty to respect it is called a \"tort,\" and the tort law is that\nbody of principles which defines these interests, duties, and the remedies available when\nthe duties have not been met.\nThe interests protected by tort law are diverse and changing. Some of the key ones,\nbut by no means all, are the following:\n-\nThe interest in bodily integrity, and in particular the right to be free from\noffensive or harmful touchings. The commonest violation of this interest is\nthe tort of ASSAULT (posing a threat of an offensive or harmful touching) or\nBATTERY (the offensive or harmful touching itself). If the interest\nthreatened is life itself, the violation is the tort of WRONGFUL DEATH.\n-\nThe interest in being free to move about, the violation of which is the tort of\nFALSE IMPRISONMENT.\n-\nThe interest in one's reputation. The violation of this interest is\nDEFAMATION, which may take the form of LIBEL (written defamation) or\nSLANDER (spoken defamation).\n-\nThe interest in controlling access to one's home or place of business. The\nviolation of this interest is TRESPASS.\n-\nThe interest against unreasonable interference with the use and enjoyment of\none's residence or place of business, which would be the tort of NUISANCE.\nSince tort law has been around a long time, much of its terminology sounds archaic,\nbut as social expectations have changed, torts have been expanded, or new torts have\narisen.\nThe more \"modern\" torts include:\n-\nINVASION OF PRIVACY;\n-\nThe infliction of EMOTIONAL DISTRESS; and\n-\nPRODUCTS LIABILITY, designed to protect the interest of consumers in\nprotection from bodily harm from consumer products.\nIn fact, as society's sense of duties changes, these changes are almost always reflected in\ntort law, which is the most elastic of the major bodies of private law.\nThe torts mentioned above all have very broad applicability. There are also many\nmore specific duties, arising under more narrowly defined circumstances, which are\n\nenforced by tort law. One especially important group of such duties are referred to\ngenerically as FIDUCIARY DUTIES. A person subject to these duties is called a\nFIDUCIARY. Broadly speaking, a fiduciary relationship is one in which the fiduciary is\ncharged with putting the interests of the other party to the relationship ahead of his own in\ncertain respects. The fiduciary is not only precluded from acting in a self-interested\nmanner: he is required to act in the interests of the other party. Physicians are fiduciaries\nfor their patients. Members of a board of directors are fiduciaries for their corporations.\nTrustees are fiduciaries for those whose assets they hold in trust.\nFiduciary duties highlight another aspect of the relationship of torts to contracts.\nThere are some duties enforced by tort law which we owe to everybody we encounter in\nlife, such as the duty to use the public ways in a manner that doesn't endanger the safety of\nothers. However, many of the more refined duties enforced by tort law arise only in\ncertain relationships which are first established by contract. For example, you do not\nsimply find yourself to be a director of a corporation, or, as a doctor, find yourself to have\na patient. These relationships are typically contractual in origin; the parties involved\nagree to form the relationship and, to some extent, agree upon its terms. However, insofar\nas the law imposes fiduciary duties (or other tort duties), it is generally not left to the\nparties to negotiate the terms of these duties. They are imposed by law. In fact, a fiduciary\nwho tried to negotiate out of his fiduciary duties would typically by that act alone be\ndeemed to be in breach of his fiduciary duty. For example, it would be wrong for a doctor\nto seek a patient's agreement to the provision of sub-standard care, or for the directors of a\ncorporation to seek the corporations's agreement to unreasonably high compensation for\ndirectors.\nTort law thus has more pronounced moral overtones than contract law. To violate a\ncontractual obligation, especially in a purely commercial setting between parties of equal\nbargaining power, may be a matter of moral indifference. To violate a duty enforced by\ntort law is wrong, and, with respect to some torts (especially fiduciary duties), a very\nserious moral matter.\nTort law is extremely complex, and distinctive bodies of doctrines have grown up\naround different tort interests. For example, there is a complex interplay between the tort\nof defamation and the constitutionally protected right of freedom of expression, especially\nas to public figures. The law of trespass blends into the complex law of real property and\nits dense collection of rights and relationships, with tenants, mortgages, sub-leases,\ncondominiums, etc. However, there are certain themes that run through much of tort law.\nThe most important of these are discussed below.\nIII. CONSENT.\nThe interests protected by tort law are often rightfully intruded upon in day-to-day\nlife, for reasons which the law recognizes and that preclude tort liability. Broadly\nspeaking, there are two grounds for such rightful intrusions: consent, discussed in this\n\nsection, and privilege, discussed in the next.\nWe routinely consent to conduct that would otherwise be tortious, i.e., of the kind\nthat would give rise to tort liability. For example, although tort law generally protects an\nindividual against bodily contact, we play at sports in which we bump into one another; get\ncrushed against others in crowded elevators; and are examined, and sometimes cut open,\nby doctors and nurses. The law approves of these contacts because there has been\nCONSENT, either EXPRESS (spoken or written and explicitly granting consent) or\nIMPLIED (inferred from other conduct).\nIf an intrusion into a protected interest is especially significant and is based upon\nconsent, the scope and validity of the consent becomes a more sensitive issue. Often, this\nsensitivity is reflected in a concern that there be INFORMED CONSENT, i.e., consent\nbased upon full information and deliberation. In fiduciary relationships, it is often the\nduty of the fiduciary to make sure that consent by the other party is adequately informed.\nSo, for example, physicians have the duty to discuss medical procedures and options\nadequately with patients, and obtain the patient's informed consent to treatment. A\ncorporate officer who seeks corporate approval for a business transaction between the\ncorporation and that officer has the duty of sharing with the corporation any information\nor insights he possesses bearing upon why the deal might be to the corporation's\ndisadvantage.\nIV. PRIVILEGE.\nThe doctrine of PRIVILEGE is an acknowledgment that intrusions upon protected\ninterests are often reasonable in the pursuit of other important social goals. A fireman who\nsees smoke coming from a building at night is supposed to smash in the front door and go\ncharging through the house dragging people out of bed. When he does so, it is not trespass\nor battery. Likewise, a peer review committee of a hospital may have the responsibility of\nunearthing and discussing even flimsy allegations about professional misconduct, and this\nis not defamation.\nPrivileges are typically quite narrowly bounded, and conduct that exceeds the\nboundaries of the privilege is tortious even if related conduct within it is not. In the above-\ncited example of a hospital peer review committee, a committee member who discussed\nsuch allegations outside of the committee and when not on committee business would likely\nbe liable for defamation. In the corporate setting, activities which would be tortious but\nfor the existence of a privilege must be carefully managed to insure that the privilege is not\nexceeded.\nV. IMMUNITY\nAnother limiting principle to the application of tort law is the concept of\n\nIMMUNITY. Consent and privilege typically carve out limited exceptions to the\nobligations enforced by tort law. Tort law immunities are typically much broader carve-\nouts, reflecting the view that for certain institutional domains, tort principles are\ninappropriate. Traditionally, there were three major immunities in tort law. One was\nactually a group of immunities clustered around FAMILY relationships, that together\nmade it very difficult for family members to sue one another in tort. That immunity has\nseriously eroded in recent years. The second was CHARITABLE IMMUNITY.\nInstitutions which were \"public charities\", such as community hospitals, were substantially\nprotected from tort liability on the theory that the protection of the charitable assets upon\nwhich the continued existence of such institutions depended was more important than\nindividual rights of recovery under tort law. However, charitable immunity has been\neither abolished or severely cut back in most states in the United States.\nThe one major immunity which is thriving is SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY, the\ndoctrine that the federal or a state government cannot be sued in tort without that\ngovernment's consent. In fact, the federal government and most state governments have\npassed statutes that permit suits under certain circumstances. However, much of\ngovernment's activities, especially those involving policy decisions, is typically still immune\nfrom tort liability. As government's role has expanded, this immunity has become more\nimportant.\nVI. THE STANDARD OF CARE AND NEGLIGENCE.\nGenerally, for a person to be liable under tort law principles, he must fail to fulfill a\nduty owed another. Often this duty is expressed as a STANDARD OF CARE. Not every\nunfortunate result or accident represents a failure by someone to meet the applicable\nstandard of care. If two people are driving their cars carefully, but nevertheless have an\naccidental collision, there will typically be no tort liability even if there has been serious\ninjury. If a doctor exercises due care with respect to a surgical procedure for a patient,\nthere is typically no tort liability even if the patient dies as a result of the procedure, and\neven if, in light of facts that later become clear, retrospect, the decision to operate was a\nmistake. Typically, conduct is not tortious in the absence of a failure to meet the\napplicable standard of care.\nThe most common standard of care is the so-called REASONABLE PERSON or\nREASONABLE MAN standard, which is the general duty to take reasonable precautions\nto protect the interests of others from harm. The reasonableness of precautions is\nevaluated under all the circumstances, including the costs of the precautions, and the social\nutility of the conduct at issue. For example, it may be unreasonable for me to drive down a\ncity street at 40 miles per hour, but not unreasonable for the emergency repair vehicle\nfrom the local gas company to do the same if it is responding to a report about a gas leak.\nThe failure to exercise reasonable care is typically referred to in law as\nNEGLIGENCE, and negligence is the most common basis of tort liability. A person who is\n\nnegligent does not necessarily intend to cause harm, and typically is simply inadvertent or\ninattentive to a risk. Tort liability generally requires FAULT, and the law considers\nnegligence a form of fault, although a relatively weak form.\nVII. INTENTIONAL TORTS.\nSometimes tortious conduct is INTENTIONAL, i.e., the party committing the\ntortious act intends to inflict the harm, or has acted in reckless disregard of the likelihood\nof harm. Some torts can be committed either negligently or intentionally, while others can\nonly be committed by intentional conduct. For example, the tort of battery must be\nintentional: it is not a battery if I accidentally trip and fall on someone else, even though\nthat other person is hurt. An INTENTIONAL TORT involves a morally more culpable\nform of fault than negligence. The damages available to victims of intentional torts are\noften broader than those available to victims of torts based on negligence. Many\nintentional torts are also CRIMES, and a person who commits such an act may find\nhimself both the defendant in a CIVIL ACTION in which he is being sued in tort by the\nvictim seeking damages, and also the defendant in a separate CRIMINAL ACTION in\nwhich the state is seeking punishment.\nVIII. CORPORATE LIABILITY FOR TORTS\nCorporations, like other legal actors, are liable for the torts they commit. However,\nsince corporations can only act through flesh-and-blood persons, the question that arises in\napplying this principle is: Whose conduct, and which of their actions, are we going to\nconsider conduct of the corporation ? There is no simple answer to this question, but it is\ngenerally true that the more responsibility an individual has in the corporate structure, the\nmore likely his acts will be considered to be acts of the corporation. So, for example, if the\nBoard of Directors, or senior management, decides on a course of conduct that is later\ndeemed tortious, the corporation will typically be considered to have committed the tort,\nand be liable under the same principles applicable to individuals.\nHowever, if an individual with less responsibility, such as a truck driver, has an\naccident on the roadway in which the driver was negligent, the analysis is more complex.\nThe truck driver would of course be negligent in his own right, but injured parties will be\nmuch more interested in suing the corporation's \"deep pocket\" than suing the driver. The\ncorporation would probably be negligent if any of its policies contributed to the negligent\nact of the driver. For example, the company might have a policy which strongly pressured\ndrivers to drive too fast, or for longer periods than a person can remain alert. Or the\ncorporation may have been negligent in the manner it selected, trained, or supervised its\ntruck drivers. Any of these acts would probably amount to corporate negligence. There\nwould be many other factors to be considered in determining corporate negligence, such\nas: Was the negligent act contrary to corporate policy ? (which makes a finding of\ncorporate negligence less likely); and, Was the act within a zone of discretion or judgment\n\ngranted to this individual by the corporation ? (which makes a finding of corporate\nnegligence more likely). Very generally, the negligent acts of employees such as truck\ndrivers, in contrast, say, to the acts of the CEO, are less likely to be considered to be the\nnegligent acts of the corporation.\nIn fact, a person injured in an accident with a corporation's truck would probably\nnot bother trying to establish corporate liability by an analysis such as sketched above.\nThere are doctrines in tort law that have developed primarily in the context of corporate\naccountability which make it possible to establish corporate liability on simpler bases. The\ntwo most important are the doctrines of \"vicarious liability\" and \"strict liability\", each of\nwhich is discussed below. Although neither is in theory limited to the corporate context, it\nis in fact within that context that both doctrines have had their most significant\ndevelopment.\nIX. STRICT LIABILITY AND CORPORATE ACCOUNTABILITY\nThe statement made earlier that tort liability generally requires fault (in the form of\neither negligence or intent) is subject to a major qualification. There is an expanding body\nof so-called STRICT LIABILITY tort law, in which a party is held responsible for certain\nkinds of harm that is caused by its conduct without a showing that it was at fault in either\nof the traditional senses. That is, even if it did not intend the harm, and took all reasonable\nprecautions to prevent it (i.e., were not negligent), it is nevertheless held responsible in tort\nand must pay tort-like damages to whomever was harmed. The most dramatic expansion\nof strict liability has been in the area of PRODUCTS LIABILITY law, which protects\nconsumers against physical injury caused by the manufacturers (and sometimes the\ndistributors) of consumer products.\nHowever, even under \"strict liability\" principles, the party being held liable is not\nliable for any and all consequences of its actions. Typically, there are limiting principles.\nFor example, in the products liability area, a manufacturer bound by strict liability\nprinciples is not responsible for every harm a product causes. If an acquaintance of mine\ngives me a concussion by banging me over the head with a coffee pot, I can't sue the\nmanufacturer of the pot. There is a requirement that the injury be due to a \"DEFECT\" in\nthe product. Without exploring here the complexities of the concept of \"defect\", it should\nbe noted that the fact that a manufacturer exercised due care in the design of the product\nwill not preclude a finding that there was a defect. However, the requirement of a defect\nalso keeps manufacturers from in effect insuring that under no circumstances will their\nproducts cause harm.\nThe policy justifications offered for strict liability in the consumer products area\ninclude the themes most often found in strict liability proposals generally: that strict\nliability avoids the difficulties of proving fault; that it can be designed to put legal\nresponsibility where it will provide the most effective incentives to avoid future harm; and\nthat it can function as a form of social insurance by placing the costs of harm on a party\n\nthat can both afford and spread these costs.\nThe principles of strict liability are rarely applied to conduct by individuals. It has\ndeveloped primarily in the business context, and been applied to corporations.\nX. VICARIOUS LIABILITY AND CORPORATE ACCOUNTABILITY\n\"VICARIOUS LIABILITY\" is present when one person (and that term is used here\nto include both natural, flesh-and-blood persons, and \"legal persons\" such as corporations)\nis, as a matter of law, held liable for the tortious conduct of another person. Vicarious\nliability (in which the law says \"A\" is responsible for the tortious conduct of \"B\") should\nnot be confused with strict liability (in which the law says \"A\" is responsible for certain\ninjurious consequences of its actions without the need to find that A's conduct involved\n\"fault\").\nThe broadest application of vicarious liability in tort law is to corporations, in the\ncircumstances discussed in VIII above, where we considered the example of the corporate\nemployee who was a truck driver and who caused an accident by driving negligently.\nUnder the doctrine of \"vicarious liability\", corporations are generally responsible for the\ntorts of all of their employees, whether or not there was any corporate fault. This is\nsometimes referred to as the doctrine of \"RESPONDEAT SUPERIOR\" (in which the\nMASTER - the archaic term for an employer - must respond for the torts of its\nSERVANTS - the archaic term for employees). Not everyone who works for a corporation\nis an employee for purposes of vicarious liability. A person who is hired under an\narrangement under which he is expected to exercise independent judgment and operate\nlargely free of the employer's supervision is sometimes an INDEPENDENT\nCONTRACTOR. The doctrine of Respondeat Superior does not apply to independent\ncontractors, although, of course, there might be employer negligence if due care was not\nexercised in the selection or monitoring of the work of an independent contractor. Doctors\nare often considered independent contractors of the hospitals with which they are\naffiliated.\nBoth strict liability (liability without fault) and vicarious liability (liability for the\ntorts of others) have expanded primarily in the area of corporate liability. These two\ntrends, combined with the expansion of tort law generally, have markedly increased tort\nexposure for corporations.\nXI. CAUSATION.\nComplex tort issues often turn on an analysis of CAUSATION, since a failure to\nperform a duty or conform to a standard of care generally gives rise to responsibility only\nfor harms that are caused by that failure. In fact, the doctrines relating to \"causation\" in\ntort law are a complex mix of two kinds of judgments. The first is what the laws calls\n\nCAUSATION IN FACT, or \"BUT-FOR\" cause (but for the act in question, the harm\nwould not have occurred). This type of cause is factually oriented, and is close to what a\nscientist would mean by cause. Causation-in-fact of the plaintiff's harm by the defendant's\nbreach of a standard of care is a necessary but not sufficient grounds for tort liability.\nThe defendant's conduct must also be the \"PROXIMATE CAUSE\"or LEGAL\nCAUSE of the plaintiff's harm. The principles of \"proximate\" or \"legal\" cause are more\nnormative, and reflect moral judgments about the scope of responsibility which society\nwishes to attach to certain acts. For example, if the defendant's negligent act caused\nadverse consequences which were not reasonably foreseeable, the law may conclude that\nresponsibility should not attach. This conclusion would be expressed by saying that there\nwas no \"legal cause.\" In one famous case, a railroad porter was negligent in assisting a\npassenger who, as a result, dropped a package. The package contained explosives, and\nanother passenger at the far end of the platform was injured by some equipment knocked\nover by the explosion. It was held that the porter's negligence was not the \"legal cause\" of\nthe second passengers's injuries.\nXII. CONTRIBUTORY AND COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE.\nIt often occurs that when a complaining party (called the PLAINTIFF) brings a\nlawsuit alleging that a harm he suffered was due to the tortious conduct of another (the\nDEFENDANT), the defendant will argue that, even though the defendant might have been\nnegligent, the plaintiff was also negligent and that the plaintiff's negligence also\ncontributed to the plaintiff's harm. Negligence by the plaintiff which increased his own\nrisk or aggravated his own harm is called CONTRIBUTORY NEGLIGENCE or\nCOMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE. If contributory or comparative negligence is found, it\nmay bar the plaintiff's suit, or reduce the plaintiff's recovery.\nThe doctrines of contributory and comparative negligence are afforded differing\ndegrees of scope in different areas of tort law. For example, if there is a dispute among the\ndifferent parties which participated in the design and building of a skyscraper about who\nwas at fault for a defect in the final structure, any party that was sued in tort would have a\nbroad opportunity to attempt to establish that the negligence of the suing party also\ncontributed to the problem. By contrast, in medical malpractice, health care providers can\nraise only a very limited issues that relate to the role of the patient in contributing to the\nhazards that resulted in injury. For example, it would be legally relevant that a patient did\nnot take prescribed medication, but conduct of the patient that caused the condition that\nrequired treatment would not be relevant, no matter how foreseeable and clear the risks of\ntreatment.\nXIII. CIVIL LITIGATION.\n\nTort law is, for the most part, judge-made law. Civil litigation is not just a forum\nfor enforcing principles of tort law: it is the primary forum in which the principles\ndevelop. The flexibility of tort law, and it's heavy reliance on open-textured standards such\nas negligence and reasonableness, reflect in part the primary role of courts and juries in\ndeveloping tort law. However, the traditional characterization of tort law as \"judge-made\"\nis subject to an increasingly important qualification concerning the role of statutes and\nregulations, as discussed below.\nXIV. STATUTES, REGULATIONS, AND \"NEGLIGENCE PER SE\".\nTraditionally, the application of standards of care under tort law have been very\nopen-textured, circumstantial, and driven by the facts of particular cases. However, when\nthere is law or regulation concerned with preventing the same harms for which tort law\nprovides a remedy, those laws or regulations will be looked to in determining the standard\nof care, at least in the sense that a failure to meet the statutory or regulatory standard will\ncreate a strong presumption of negligence. For example, if it is alleged that a driver was\ngoing unreasonably fast, the fact that the posted maximum speed was 25 mph and he was\ngoing 45 mph will probably, in the absence of special circumstances, come close to\ndetermining the appropriate standard. A finding of negligence based on a statutory or\nregulatory standard is said to be \"NEGLIGENCE PER SE\".\nAs regulation has become more common, the negligence per se doctrine has become\nmore important. It is one of the major ways in which tort law keeps \"up to date.\"\nFurthermore, it adds some very effective remedies to regulatory schemes that might, taken\njust on their own terms, appear deficient with respect to enforcement. So, for example,\nwhen there is an expansion of regulation into a new area, such as environmental risks, this\nis usually complemented by a growth of tort liability based in part on the new regulatory\nstandards.\nRev. 3/7/99"
