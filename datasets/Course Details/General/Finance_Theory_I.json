Bonds with coupons always have a maturity that\nis lower than its maturity date. They accelerate cash\nflows received from the investment reducing the\nduration. On the other hand, zero-coupon bonds that,\nfor example, mature in 3 years will necessarily have a\nmaturity of 3 years. This is determined by the formula:\n-\n\nZero-Coupons have a duration of \"T\"\nsince there is only one CF:\n-\n\nCoupon Bonds maturing in \"T\"\n\nhave a\nduration of less than \"T\"\n\nsince there\nare cash flows occurring at T-1, T-2,\netc.\nT\nT\ny\nCF\nB\n)\n1( +\n=\n\nQ1\nQ1 --\nTrue or False\nTrue or False\nb) The market price of a share of stock equals the\ndiscounted value of the stream of future\nearnings per share\nAdvice:\ny Look for relevant formulas Æ DCF\ny Read carefully. For example:\n‒\n\nEarnings =\n\nDividends\n‒\n\nRevenues =\n\nProfits\n‒\n\nFace Value =\n\nPresent Value\n\nQ1\nQ1 --\nTrue or False\nTrue or False\nb) The market price of a share of stock equals the\ndiscounted value of the stream of future\nearnings per share\nAnswer:\nFALSE. The market value of a share of stock equals the\ndiscounted value of the stream of future dividends\nper share. It \"works\"\n\nwith earnings if and only if the\nplowback (b) ratio = 0, making the payout (p) ratio =\n1 and thus EPS = Dividends. Mathematically:\nWhere D1\n\n= Dividends, not EPS\n\nQ1\nQ1 --\nTrue or False\nTrue or False\nc) Growth stocks must have a plowback ratio > 1\nAdvice:\ny Clearly lay out the definition of a growth stock\n\nQ1\nQ1 --\nTrue or False\nTrue or False\nc) Growth stocks must have a plowback ratio > 1\nAnswer:\nFALSE. Recall that Stocks of companies that have access to\ngrowth opportunities are considered growth stocks,\nGrowth opportunities are investment opportunities that\nearn expected returns higher than the required rate of\nreturn on capital. By this definition, a growth stock has:\nROE > r\nThe plowback ratio does not need to be greater than 1\n\nQ1\nQ1 --\nTrue or False\nTrue or False\nd) If a commercial airline wants to hedge its risk\nagainst oil prices, it should go short in oil\nfutures\nAdvice:\ny Think of examples and counterexamples\ny Remember class and definitions!\n\nQ1\nQ1 --\nTrue or False\nTrue or False\nd) If a commercial airline wants to hedge its risk\nagainst oil prices, it should go short in oil\nfutures\nAnswer:\nFALSE. One can argue that airlines are short fuel cost. So to hedge that they\nhave to go long\n\noil future. On the other hand, they can pass down the\ncost of higher fuel prices to their clients so it is equally likely that they\ndon't need to hedge 100% of their exposure (recall they will be in a\n\ndisadvantage if they hedge and their competition did not hedge and prices\nfall as they have done recently).\nIn general, entering into a futures contract does not provide a hedge in itself.\nThis is why not all airlines hedge all their gas purchases. Actually, the range\nvary widely from 0% of gas bought on futures to 100% of gas bought on\nfutures, with notorious examples such as Southwest Airlines.\n\nQ1\nQ1 --\nTrue or False\nTrue or False\ne) The value of an American call option is always\nequal to the value of a European call option\nAdvice:\ny Read carefully, and seek to understand the difference\nbetween American and European options:\n‒\n\nEuropean Æ Can only be exercised at expiration\n‒\n\nAmerican Æ Can be exercised on or before\nexpiration\ny Use your logic: Would you pay the same? Is there an\neffect due to time value of money?\n\nQ1\nQ1 --\nTrue or False\nTrue or False\ne) The value of an American call option is always\nequal to the value of a European call option\nAnswer:\nFALSE. American Call options can be worth more than\nEuropean options as they can be exercised before\nexpiration. Therefore, the person who exercises the\noption could benefit from having the money early as\nwell from not taking the risk of a reduction in the price\nof the underlying asset. Ultimately, this is related to the\nissue of dividend payment but we will not get into that\nhere\n\nQ1\nQ1 --\nTrue or False\nTrue or False\nf) Holding everything else constant, the price of a\nEuropean call option is increasing with\nincreasing risk free interest rate.\nAdvice:\ny Look for formulas or other content in your\n\"cheat sheet\" that may help you to answer the\nquestion.

According to the call-put parity, if\neverything else stays constant, when the risk-\nfree rate increases the value of a call will\nnecessarily have to increase:\n(\n)\nS\nP\nr\nK\nC\nT\n+\n↓\n=\n↑\n+\n+\n↑\n\nQ1\nQ1 --\nTrue or False\nTrue or False\ng) Investors do not get rewarded for bearing\nidiosyncratic risk.\nAdvice:\ny Carefully read the language - there is an\nimportant difference between \"idiosyncratic\"\nrisk (also called non-systematic risk) and\n\"systematic\" risk\ny If you do not know the answer for this one,\nstudy a lot from here until tomorrow!!!\n\nQ1\nQ1 --\nTrue or False\nTrue or False\ng) Investors do not get rewarded for bearing\nidiosyncratic risk.\ny TRUE. Investors only get rewarded for bearing the\nsystemic risk, which is directly tied to the β of a stock.\nNotice that:\nAccording to portfolio theory/CAPM, the idiosyncratic\nrisk can be easily diversified and therefore it is not\nexpected that you will get compensated for this:\n(CAPM)\n\nQ1\nQ1 --\nTrue or False\nTrue or False\nh) CAPM implies that all risky assets must have a\npositive risk premium.\nAdvice:\ny Use the direct cue that the question is giving:\nThis can be explained though CAPM!\n\nQ1\nQ1 --\nTrue or False\nTrue or False\nh) CAPM implies that all risky assets must have a\npositive risk premium.\nAnswer:\ny FALSE.

Liquidity premium is only one component of the term structure, which also\ndepends on investors' expectation of future spot rates. If investors expect spot\nrates to fall, the term structure could be flat or downward-sloping.\n(b) True. Modified duration measures the sensitivity of a bond's price to a change\nin the yield. If a bond's coupon rate move with the interest rate, its price is less\nsensitive to a change in the yield. For example, when the yield increases, the\nprice of a regular bond would decrease. A floater, however, would have its coupon\npayments increased to offset the decrease in price. It would therefore have a lower\nmodified duration.\n2.

(a) The firm's COGS is negatively correlated with the price of salmon in six months\n(-ST ), so it is similar to shorting futures contracts (payoff = FT - ST ). The\nfirm's revenue, however, is not directly related to the price of salmon. It depends\non the pricing rule the firm uses and the demand condition for its products. For\nexample, if the firm raises price in response to higher cost and the price elasticity\nof demand is sufficiently small, revenue would be positively correlated with the\nprice of salmon in six months, so it would be similar to a long position in futures\n(payoff = ST - FT ).\n(b) Spot-futures parity:\nFT = S0(1 + r - y)T\n4800 = 5000(1 + 0.25% - y)6\ny = 0.9281% per month\n5.

When ROE > r, the firm can generate a higher return on\na given investment than the investors can, so the value of the additional reinvest\nment is higher than the value of the loss dividend. The net effect is an increase\nin firm value and a higher stock price.\nTo see this result mathematically, we note that\nEP S1×(1-b)\nP0\nr-g\n1 - b\nPE =\n=\n=\nEP S1\nEP S1\nr - g\nSince g = ROE × b,\n1 - b\n1 - b\nPE =\n=\nROE\nr - ROE × b\nr 1 -\nr b\nSince ROE > r, an increase in b reduces the denominator more than it does the\nnumerator, so the ratio increases.\n6.

Since $104 > $102.31, Bond C is overval\nued. The strategy should be to short C and long A and B. Suppose we short 1 C.\nwe can offset the positive cashflow at t = 2 by buying 1.07 B. We can offset the\npositive cashflow at t = 1 by buying 0.07 A. An arbitrage portfolio is as follows:\nlong 0.07 of Bond A; long 1.07 of Bond B; short 1 of Bond C.\nCF at 0 = -95 × 0.07 - 89.4 × 1.07 + 104 × 1 = $1.69\nCF at 1 = 100 × 0.07 + 7 × (-1) = $0\nCF at 2 = 100 × 1.07 + 107 × (-1) = $0\nAny portfolio that has the form (0.07k, 1.07k, -k), k > 0 is an arbitrage portfolio\nthat generates $1.69k at time 0 and no cashflow at any other time.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n15.401 Finance Theory I\nFall 2008\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

Lo\nCourse Summary\n\nKey Points: Options and Other Derivatives\n15.401\nSlide 11\n\nOptions have nonlinear payoffs, as diagrams show\n\nSome options can be viewed as insurance contracts\n\nOption strategies allow investors to take more sophisticated bets\n\nValuation is typically derived via arbitrage arguments (e.g., binomial)\n\nOption-pricing models have a long and illustrious history\n(c) 2007-2008 by Andrew W. Lo\nCourse Summary\n\nKey Points: Introduction to Risk and Return\n\n15.401\nSlide 12\nAnomalies:\n\nSize Effect: Smaller stocks typically outperform larger stocks,\nespecially in January.\n\nJanuary Effect: Returns in January tend to be abnormally high.\n\nValue Effect: Low P/B (value) stocks typically outperform high P/B\n(growth) stocks.\n\nMomentum: Stocks with high returns over the past 12 months\ntypically continue to outperform stocks with low past returns.\n\nAccruals and Issuances: Stocks with high past accruals and/or\nrecent stock offerings typically underperform stocks with low past\naccruals and no stock offerings.\n(c) 2007-2008 by Andrew W. Lo\nCourse Summary\n\nKey Points: Portfolio Theory\n\n15.401\nSlide 13\n\nDiversification reduces risk. The standard deviation of a portfolio is\nalways less than the average standard deviation of the individual\nstocks in the portfolio.\n\nIn diversified portfolios, covariances among stocks are more\nimportant than individual variances. Only systematic risk matters.\n\nInvestors should try to hold portfolios on the efficient frontier.\nThese portfolios maximize expected return for a given level of risk.\n\nWith a riskless asset, all investors should hold the tangency\nportfolio. This portfolio maximizes the trade-off between risk and\nexpected return.\n(c) 2007-2008 by Andrew W. Lo\nCourse Summary\n\nKey Points: The CAPM\n\nTangency portfolio is the market portfolio\n\nThis yields the capital market line (efficient portfolios)\n\nThe CAPM generalizes this relationship for any security or portfolio:\n\nThe security market line yields a measure of risk: beta\n\nThis provides a method for estimating a firm's cost of capital\n\nThe CAPM also provides a method for evaluating portfolio managers\n- Alpha is the correct measure of performance, not total return\n- Alpha takes into account the differences in risk among managers\n\nEmpirical research is mixed, but the framework is very useful\n(c) 2007-2008 by Andrew W. Lo\nCourse Summary\n15.401\nSlide 14\n\nKey Points: Capital Budgeting\n*\nUse the NPV rule for capital budgeting decisions: take all projects with\npositive NPV, or take highest-NPV project if mutually exclusive\n*\nConsider project interactions separately\n*\nUse after-tax cashflows for NPV calculations, not accounting earnings\n*\nUse the CAPM to estimate cost of capital with project beta\n*\nBe careful about risks that change over time or across different stages\n*\nBe wary of alternative to NPV:\n- Payback rule, discounted payback rule\n- Profitability index\n- Internal rate of return\n\n(c) 2007-2008 by Andrew W.

Lo\nLecture 7: Equities\n15.401\nSlide 10\nThe Dividend Discount Model\nThe Dividend Discount Model\nExample:\nDividends are expected to grow at 6% per year and the current dividend\nis $1 per share. The expected rate of return is 20%. What should the\ncurrent stock price be?\n\nNote: DDM with constant growth gives a relation between current\nstock price, current dividend, dividend growth rate and the expected\nreturn. Knowing three of the variables determines the fourth.\n\n(c) 2007-2008 by Andrew W.

Lo\nLecture 7: Equities\n15.401\nSlide 12\nDDM with Multiple\nDDM with Multiple--Stage Growth\nStage Growth\nFirms May Have Multiple Stages of Growth\n\nGrowth Stage: rapidly expanding sales, high profit margins, and\nabnormally high growth in earnings per share, many new investment\nopportunities, low dividend payout ratio\n\nTransition Stage: growth rate and profit margin reduced by\ncompetition, fewer new investment opportunities, high payout ratio\n\nMature Stage: earnings growth, payout ratio and average return on\nequity stabilizes for the remaining life of the firm\nExample:\nA company with D0 = $1 and r = 20% grows at 6% for the first 7 years\nand then drops to zero thereafter. What should its current price be?\n\n(c) 2007-2008 by Andrew W. Lo\nLecture 7: Equities\n15.401\nSlide 13\nEPS and P/E\nEPS and P/E\nDividend Forecasts Involve Many Practical Challenges\n\nTerminology:\n- Earnings: total profit net of depreciation and taxes\n- Payout Ratio p: dividend/earnings = DPS/EPS\n- Retained Earnings: (earnings - dividends)\n- Plowback Ratio b: retained earnings/total earnings\n- Book Value BV: cumulative retained earnings\n- Return on Book Equity ROE: earnings/BV\n\nUsing these concepts, different valuation formulas may be derived\n\nNote: these are mostly based on accounting data, not market values\n\n(c) 2007-2008 by Andrew W. Lo\nLecture 7: Equities\n15.401\nSlide 14\nEPS and P/E\nEPS and P/E\nExample:\n(Myers) Texas Western (TW) is expected to earn $1.00 next year. Book\nvalue per share is $10.00 now. TW plans an investment program\nwhich will increase net book assets by 8% per year. Earnings are\nexpected to grow proportionally. The investment is financed by\nretained earnings. The discount rate is 10%, which is assumed to be\nthe same as the rate of return on new investments. Price TW's share\nprice if\n- TW expands at 8% forever\n- TW's expansion slows down to 4% after year 5\n\nObserve that\n- Plowback Ratio b = (10)(0.08)/(1) = 0.8\n- Payout Ratio p = (1-0.8)/(1) = 0.2\n- ROE = 10%\n\n(c) 2007-2008 by Andrew W.

Lo\nLecture 7: Equities\n15.401\nSlide 17\nGrowth Opportunities and Growth Stocks\nGrowth Opportunities and Growth Stocks\nWhat Are Growth Stocks?\n\nStocks of companies that have access to growth opportunities are\nconsidered growth stocks\n\nGrowth opportunities are investment opportunities that earn\nexpected returns higher than the required rate of return on capital\n\nExample: IBM in the 60's and 70's.\n\nNote: The following may not be growth stocks\n- A stock with growing EPS\n- A stock with growing dividends\n- A stock with growing assets\n\nNote: The following may be growth stocks\n- A stock with EPS growing slower than required rate of return\n- A stock with DPS growing slower than required rate of return\n\n(c) 2007-2008 by Andrew W. Lo\nLecture 7: Equities\n15.401\nSlide 18\nGrowth Opportunities and Growth Stocks\nGrowth Opportunities and Growth Stocks\nExample:\nABC Software has: Expected EPS next year of $8.33; Payout ratio of\n0.6; ROE of 25%; and, cost of capital of r=15%\n\nFollowing a no-growth strategy (g=0,p=1), its value is\n\nFollowing a growth strategy, its price is\n\nDifference of $100 - $55.56 = $44.44 comes from growth\nopportunities, which offers a return of 25%, higher than the required\nrate of return 15%\n\n(c) 2007-2008 by Andrew W. Lo\nLecture 7: Equities\n15.401\nSlide 19\nGrowth Opportunities and Growth Stocks\nGrowth Opportunities and Growth Stocks\nExample (cont):\n\nAt t = 1: ABC can invest (0.4)(8.33)=$3.33 at a permanent 25% rate of\nreturn. This investment generates a cash flow of (0.25)(3.33) = $0.83\nper year starting at the t=2. Its NPV at t=1 is\n\nAt t = 2: Everything is the same except that ABC will invest $3.67,\n10% more than at t = 1 (the growth is 10%). The investment is made\nwith NPV being\n\nThe total present value of growth opportunities (PVGO) is\n\nThis makes up the difference in value between growth and no-growth\n\n(c) 2007-2008 by Andrew W. Lo\nLecture 7: Equities\n15.401\nSlide 20\nGrowth Opportunities and Growth Stocks\nGrowth Opportunities and Growth Stocks\nStock Price Can Be Decomposed Into Two Components\n1. Present value of earnings under a no-growth policy\n2. Present value of growth opportunities\n\nTerminology*:\n- Earnings yield: E/P = EPS1/P0\n- P/E ratio: P/E = P0/EPS1\n*Note: In newspapers, P/E ratios are often computed with the most recent earnings, but investors\nare more concerned with price relative to future earnings.\n\n(c) 2007-2008 by Andrew W. Lo\nLecture 7: Equities\n15.401\nSlide 21\nGrowth Opportunities and Growth Stocks\nGrowth Opportunities and Growth Stocks\n\nIf PVGO = 0, P/E ratio equals inverse of cost of capital\n\nIf PVGO > 0, P/E ratio becomes higher:\n\nPVGO is positive only if the firm earns more than its cost of capital\n\n(c) 2007-2008 by Andrew W.

Our business and risk strategy was to buy\npools of assets, mainly bonds; warehouse them on our own\nbalance-sheet and structure them into CDOs; and finally distribute\nthem to end investors. We were most eager to sell the non-\ninvestment-grade tranches, and our risk approvals were\nconditional on reducing these to zero. We would allow positions\nof the top-rated AAA and super-senior (even better than AAA)\ntranches to be held on our own balance-sheet as the default risk\nwas deemed to be well protected by all the lower tranches, which\nwould have to absorb any prior losses.\n(c) The Economist.

From a risk-management point of view, this was perfect:\nhave a long position in the low-risk asset, and a short one in the\nhigher-risk one. But the reverse happened of what we had\nexpected: AAA tranches went down in price and non-\ninvestment-grade tranches went up, resulting in losses as we\nmarked the positions to market.\nThis was entirely counter-intuitive. Explanations of why this had\nhappened were confusing and focused on complicated cross-\ncorrelations between tranches. In essence it turned out that there\nhad been a short squeeze in non-investment-grade tranches,\ndriving their prices up, and a general selling of all more senior\nstructured tranches, even the very best AAA ones.\n(c) The Economist.

Prices are quoted in each country's\ncurrency, so fluctuations in the € / $ and R / $ exchange rates have a\nbig impact on the firm's revenues. How can the firm reduce (or\n'hedge') these risks?\n\nYour firm is thinking about issuing 10-year convertible bonds. In the\npast, the firm has issued straight debt with a yield-to-maturity of 8.2%.\nIf the new bonds are convertible into 20 shares of stocks, per $1,000\nface value, what interest rate will the firm have to pay on the bonds?\n\nYou have the opportunity to buy a mine with 1 million kgs of copper for\n$400,000. Copper has a price of $2.2 / kg, mining costs are $2 / kg,\nand you can delay extraction one year. How valuable is the option to\ndelay? Is the mine a good deal?\n\n(c) 2007-2008 by Andrew W.

In effect, the author resorts to a comparison with the\nanalytical theory of the propagation of heat. A little reflection shows that the analogy is\nreal and the comparison legitimate. Fourier's reasoning is applicable almost without\nchange to this problem, which is so different from that for which it had been created.

The standard deviation of a portfolio is\nalways less than the average standard deviation of the individual\nstocks in the portfolio.\n\nIn diversified portfolios, covariances among stocks are more\nimportant than individual variances. Only systematic risk matters.\n\nInvestors should try to hold portfolios on the efficient frontier.\nThese portfolios maximize expected return for a given level of risk.\n\nWith a riskless asset, all investors should hold the tangency\nportfolio. This portfolio maximizes the trade-off between risk and\nexpected return.\n\n(c) 2007-2008 by Andrew W.

Real interest rate has been slightly positive on average.\n2. Return on more risky assets has been higher on average than return\non less risky assets.\n3. Returns on risky assets can be highly correlated to each other.\n4.

The standard deviation of returns for the overall\nmarket is 4.5% monthly (16.4% annually).\n\nIndividual stocks are much riskier. The average monthly standard\ndeviation of an individual stock is around 17% (or 50% annually).\n\nStocks tend to move together over time: when one stock goes up, other\nstocks are likely to go up as well. The correlation is far from perfect.\n\nStock returns are nearly unpredictable. For example, knowing how a stock\ndoes this month tells you very little about what will happen next month.\n\nMarket volatility changes over time. Prices are sometimes quite volatile.\nThe standard deviation of monthly returns varies from roughly 2% to 20%.\n\nFinancial ratios like DY and P/E ratios vary widely over time. DY hit a\nmaximum of 13.8% in 1932 and a minimum of 1.17% in 1999. The P/E ratio\nhit a maximum of 33.4 in 1999 and a minimum of 5.3 in 1917.\n\n(c) 2007-2008 by Andrew W. Lo\nLecture 12: Intro to Risk and Return\n15.401\nSlide 34\nKey Points\nKey Points\nAnomalies:\n\nSize Effect: Smaller stocks typically outperform larger stocks,\nespecially in January.\n\nJanuary Effect: Returns in January tend to be abnormally high.\n\nValue Effect: Low P/B (value) stocks typically outperform high P/B\n(growth) stocks.\n\nMomentum: Stocks with high returns over the past 12 months\ntypically continue to outperform stocks with low past returns.\n\nAccruals and Issuances: Stocks with high past accruals and/or\nrecent stock offerings typically underperform stocks with low past\naccruals and no stock offerings.\n\n(c) 2007-2008 by Andrew W.

True, false or \"it depends\" (give a brief explanation): PV is sometimes calculated by\ndiscounting free cash flow for several years, say from year 1 to T, and then discounting\na forecasted terminal value at horizon date T. The choice of the horizon date can hae\na significant effect on PV, particularly for rapidly growing firms.\n7. Suppose you invest $10,000 per year for 10 years at an average return of 5.5%. The\naverage future inflation rate is 2% per year.\n(a) The first investment is made immediately. What is your ending investment bal-\nance?\n(b) What is its purchasing power in todays dollars?\n8.

You have just inherited an office building. You expect the annual rental income (net\nof maintenance and other cost) for the building to be $100,000 for the next year and\nto increase at 5% per year indefinitely. A expanding internet company offers to rent\nthe building at a fixed annual rent for 5 years. After year 5, you could re-negotiate\nor rent the building to another tenant. What is the minimum acceptable fixed rental\npayments for this five-year agreement? Use a discount rate of 12%.\n10. Two dealers compete to sell you a new Hummer with a list price of $45,000. Dealer\nC offers to sell it for $40,000 cash. Dealer F offers \"0-percent financing:\" 48 monthly\npayments of $937.50.

Your sales are $10 million this and expected to grow at 5% in real terms for the next\nthree years. The appropriate nominal discount rate is 10%. The inflation is expected\nto be 2% per year during the same period. What is the present value of your sales\nrevenue for the next three years?\nFall 2008\nPage 2 of 66\n\n12. Company ABC's after-tax cash flow is $10 million (at the end of) this year and expected\nto grow at 5% per year forever. The appropriate discount rate is 9%. What is the value\nof company ABC?\n13. You own three oil wells in Vidalia, Texas. They are expected to produce 7,000 barrels\nnext year in total, but production is declining by 6 percent every year after that.\nFortunately, you have a contract fixing the selling price at $15 per barrel for the next\n12 years. What is the present value of the revenues from the well during the remaining\nlife of the contract? Assume a discount rate of 8 percent.\n14. A geothermal power station produces cash flow at a current rate of $14 million per\nyear, after maintenance, all operating expenses and taxes. All the cash flow is paid\nout to the power stations owners. The cash flow is expected to grow at the inflation\nrate, which is forecasted at 2% per year. The opportunity cost of capital is 8%, about\n3 percentage points above the long-term Treasury rate. (Assume this is an annually\ncompounded rate.)\nThe power station will operate for a very long time. Assume for simplicity that it will\nlast forever.\n(a) What is the present value of the power station? Assume the first cash flow is\nreceived one year hence.\n(b) Now assume that the power stations cash flow is generated in a continuous stream,\nstarting immediately. What is the present value?\n15. A foundation announces that it will be offering one MIT scholarship every year for an\nindefinite number of years. The first scholarship is to be offered exactly one year from\nnow. When the scholarship is offered, the student will receive $20,000 annually for a\nperiod of four years, beginning from the date the scholarship is offered. This student\nis then expected to repay the principal amount received ($80,000) in 10 equal annual\ninstallments, interest-free, starting one year after the expiration of her scholarship.\nThis implies that the foundation is really giving an interest-free loan under the guise of\na scholarship. The current interest is 6% for all maturities and is expected to remain\nunchanged.\n(a) What is the PV of the first scholarship?\n(b) The foundation invests a lump sum to fund all future scholarships. Determine\nthe size of the investment today.\n16. You signed a rental lease for an office space in the Back Bay for five years with an\nannual rent of $1 million, paid at the beginning of each year of the lease. Just before\nyou pay your first rent, the property owner wants to use the space for another purpose\nand proposes to buy back the lease from you. The rent for similar space is now $1.25\nmillion per year. What would be the minimum compensation that you would ask from\nthe property owner? Assume the interest rate to be 6%.\nFall 2008\nPage 3 of 66\n\n17. The annual membership fee at your health club is $750 a year and is expected to\nincrease at 5% per year. A life membership is $7,500 and the discount rate is 12%.\nIn order to justify taking out the life membership, what would be your minimum life\nexpectancy?\n18. You are considering buying a car worth $30,000. The dealer, who is anxious to sell the\ncar, offers you an attractive financing package. You have to make a down-payment of\n$3,500, and pay the rest over 5 years with annual payments. The dealer will charge\nyou interest at a constant annual interest rate of 2%, which may be different from the\nmarket interest rate.\n(a) What is the annual payment to the dealer?\n(b) The dealer offers you a second option: you pay cash, but get a $2,500 rebate.\nShould you go for the loan or should you pay cash? Assume that the market\nannual interest rate is constant at 5%.\nNote: the tradeoffbetween the two options is that in the first case, you can finance\nyour purchase at a relatively low rate of interest. In the second case, you receive a\nlump-sum cash rebate.\n19. Your brother-in-law asks you to lend him $100,000 as a second mortgage on his vacation\nhome. He promises to make level monthly payments for 10 years, 120 payments in all.\nYou decide that a fair interest rate is 8% compounded annually. What should the\nmonthly payment be on the $100,000 loan?\n20. Your cousin is entering medical school next fall and asks you for financial help. He\nneeds $65,000 each year for the first two years. After that, he is in residency for two\nyears and will be able to pay you back $10,000 each year.

I f he goes to a business school, he\ngives up his income for two years and, in addition, pays $20,000 per year for tuition.\nIn return, John expects an increase in his salary after his MBA is completed. Suppose\nthat the post-graduation salary increases at a 5% per year and that the discount rate\nis 8%. What is miminum expected starting salary after graduation that makes going\nto a business school a positive-NPV investment for John?

Your salary is\n$100,000, and your contract is for 5 years. Your salary will stay the same during the 5\nyears and, since you are at the IMF, you are not subject to taxes. If you do well (which\nwe assume will happen with certainty), you will get a permanent contract. Under this\ncontract, your salary will grow at the rate of 3% per year, until retirement. Retirement\nwill occur in 30 years after your contract becomes permanent.\nFor simplicity, assume that your salary is paid at the end of each year.

Retirement planning: Mr. Jones is contemplating retirement. He is 55 and his net\nworth now is $2 million. He hopes that after retirement he can maintain a lifestyle\nthat costs him $100,000 per year in today's dollars (i.e., real dollars, inflation adjusted).\nIf he retires, he will invest all his net worth in government bonds that yield a safe\nannual return of 5%.

The Reborn VW Beetle.\nYou are considering the purchase of a new car, the reborn VW Beetle, and you have\nbeen offered two different deals from two different dealers. Dealer A offers to sell you\nthe car for $20,000, but allows you to put down $2,000 and pay back $18,000 over 36\nmonths (fixed payment each month) at a rate of 8% compounded monthly. Dealer\nB offers to sell you the car for $19,500 but requires a down payment of $4,000 with\nrepayment of the remaining $15,500 over 36 months at 10% compounded monthly.\nWhich deal would you choose? (Hint: Find ranges of market interest rates that make\none deal more attractive than the other.)\n33. Dear Financial Adviser,\nMy spouse and I are each 62 and hope to retire in 3 years. After retirement we will\nreceive $5,000 per month after taxes from our employers pension plans and $1000 per\nmonth after taxes from Social Security. Unfortunately our monthly living expenses are\n$15,000. Our social obligations preclude further economies.\nWe have $1,200,000 invested in a high-grade corporate-bond mutual fund. Unfortu-\nnately the after-tax return on the fund has dropped to 3.5% per year. We plan to\nmake annual withdrawals from the fund to cover the difference between our pension\nand social security income and our living expenses. How long will the money last?\nSincerely,\nLuxury Challenged\nMarblehead, MA\n34. The annually compounded discount rate is 5.5%. You are asked to calculate the present\nvalue of a 12-year annuity with payments of $50,000 per year. Calculate PV for each\nof the following cases.\n(a) The annuity payments arrive at one-year intervals. The first payment arrives one\nyear from now.\n(b) The first payment arrives in 6 months. Following payments arrive at one-year\nintervals, at 18 months, 30 months, etc.\n35. IRA Accounts and Taxes.\nAn Individual Retirement Account (IRA) allows you to set aside a limited amount\nof money each year for retirement. These funds will have a special tax status that\nFall 2008\nPage 7 of 66\n\ndepends on several factors. (These factors include your marital status, whether you\nhave other sources of retirement savings, your income, etc.)\nSuppose that you have $2,000 in pretax income to contribute to the IRA at the end of\neach year (starting with the end of the current year, i.e., year 1). You will retire in 30\nyears, and your marginal tax rate will be 28% for all years. Suppose that the account\nreturns a fixed 6% each year until you retire. For simplicity, assume that you withdraw\nall money at your retirement, and any tax-deferred income is taxed at that time.\n(a) How much money will you have in year 30 if neither the contribution nor the in-\nterest income is tax-deferred? (In this case, you can withdraw the money without\npaying any additional tax at year 30.)\n(b) How much money will you have in 30 years if the contribution is not tax-deferred\nbut the interest income is? (In this case, only the cumulative interest is taxed at\nyear 30.)\n(c) How much money will you have in 30 years if both the contribution and the\ninterest income are tax-deferred?\n(d) Would you expect the benefit of tax deferral to increase or decrease as the tax\nrate increases? Why?\nFall 2008\nPage 8 of 66\n\nFixed Income Securities\n1. True or False? Briefly explain (or qualify) your answers.\n(a) The duration of a coupon bond maturing at date T is always less than the duration\nof a zero-coupon bond maturing on the same date.\n(b) When investing in bonds, we should invest in bonds with higher yields to maturity\n(YTM) because they give higher expected returns.\n(c) The phrase \"On the run\" refers to junk bonds that have recently defaulted.\n2. True or false? Briefly explain (or qualify) your answers.\n(a) Investors expect higher returns on long-term bonds than short-term bonds because\nthey are riskier. Thus the term structure of interest rates is always upward sloping.\n(b) Bonds whose coupon rates fall when the general level of interest rates rise are\ncalled reverse floaters. Everything else the same, these bonds have a lower modi-\nfied duration than their straight bond counterparts.\n3. True, false or \"it depends\" (give a brief explanation):\n(a) Term structure of interest rates must be always upward sloping because longer\nmaturity bonds are riskier.\n(b) Bonds with higher coupon rates have more interest rate risk.\n4. True, false (give a brief explanation): The term structure of interest rates is always\nupward sloping because bonds with longer maturities are riskier and earn higher re-\nturns.\n5. True or false (give a brief explanation): A flat term structure (identical spot rates for\nall maturities) indicates that investors do not expect interest rates to change in the\nfuture.\n6. True or false (give a brief explanation): To reduce interest rate risk, an over-funded\npension fund, i.e., a fund with more assets than liabilities, should invest in assets with\nlonger duration than its liabilities.\n7. Which security has a higher effective annual interest rate?\n(a) A three-month T-bill selling at $97, 645 with face value of $100, 000.\n(b) A coupon bond selling at par and paying a 10% coupon semi-annually.\n8.

The first zero coupon bond matures in exactly 6 years, and the second zero\ncoupon bond matures in exactly 16 years. Both of these bonds are currently selling\nfor a market price of $100. Suppose that the yield curve is flat at 7.5%. Is it possible\nfor Valerie to construct a bond portfolio having a duration of 9 years using these two\ntypes of zero coupon bonds? If so, how? (Describe the actual portfolio.) If not, why\nnot?\n36. Given the bond prices in the question above, you plan to borrow $15 million one year\nfrom now (end of year 1). It will be a two-year loan (from year 1 to year 3) with\ninterest paid at the ends of year 2 and 3. The cash flow is as follows:\nYear 1\nYear 2\nYear 3\nBorrow $15M\nPay interest\nPay interest plus principal of 15M\nExplain how you could arrange this loan today and \"lock in\" the interest rate on the\nloan. What transactions today would be required? What would the interest rate be?\nYou can buy or sell any of the bonds listed above (in the previous question).\n37. You purchased a 3 year coupon bond one year ago. Its par value is $1,000 and coupon\nrate is 6%, paid annually. At the time you purchased the bond, its yield to maturity\nwas 6.5%. Suppose you sell the bond after receiving the first interest payment.\nFall 2008\nPage 18 of 66\n\n(a) What is the total rate of return from holding the bond for the year if the yield to\nmaturity remains at 6.5% when you sell it?\n(b) What if the yield to maturity becomes 6.0% when you sell it?\n38. You manage a pension fund, which provides retired workers with lifetime annuities.\nThe fund must pay out $1 million per year to cover these annuities.\nAssume for\nsimplicity that these payments continue for 20 years and then cease. The interest rate\nis 4% (flat term structure). You plan to cover this obligation by investing in 5- and\n20-year maturity Treasury strips.\n(a) What is the duration of the funds 20-year payout obligation?\n(b) You decide to minimize the funds exposure to changes in interest rates. How\nmuch should you invest in the 5- and 20- year strips? What will be the par value\nof your holdings of each strip?\n(c) After three months, you reexamine the pension funds investment strategy. Interest\nrates have increased. You still want to minimize exposure to interest rate risk.\nWill you invest more in 20-year strips and less in 5-year strips? Explain briefly.\n39.

What will be your real return?\n(b) Suppose inflation jumps to 3% right after you buy the bond and stay at 3% for\nthe next 5 years. What would your real return be?\n(c) TIPS are government risk-free bond that provides protection for inflation. Let's\nlook at a 5-year TIPS with 2% real coupon (and $100 principal). The way TIPS\nwork is that the $100 principal is expressed in real terms. Therefore in nominal\n(dollar), the principal increases each year with inflation. Therefore if inflation\nis 2% each year, then the principal becomes $102 (100*(1+2%))in year 1, and\n$102*1.02 = $104.04 in year 2, etc. The coupon payment each year is based on\nthe new principal adjusted for inflation. For this 5-year TIPS, calculate the cash\nflow from the bond each year if inflation is (i)2%, and (ii) 3%, respectively.\nFall 2008\nPage 27 of 66\n\nCommon Stock\n1. True or False?

Bonds with longer duration have usually higher yield to maturity (YTM) as a\nresult of increasing yield curve.\n2. Bonds with higher probability of default have higher YTM to compensate for\ncredit risk.\nFull answer must mention at least one of these two points. Many students con-\ncentrated on reinvestment risk only.\n(c) FALSE\n\"On the run\" refers to a newly issued bond. These bonds are usually more liquid\nand trade at a premium.\n2.\n(a) False: yield of longer term bond also incorporates the expectation of future short\nterm interest rates and depending on the this factor, the term structure may be\nup- or down-ward sloping.\n(b) False: If interest rates rise, future coupons of such bonds fall, and so their price\n(which is the present value of future coupons) falls more than the price of its\nstraight bond counterpart. If interest rates fall, future coupons of such bonds\nrise, and so their price (which is the present value of future coupons) rises more\nthan the price of its straight bond counterpart. So these bonds are more interest\nrate sensitive.\n3.\n(a) False. The term structure of interest rates depends on expected future interest\nrates, if short term interest rates are expected to decrease substantially, the term\nstructure can be inverted, flat, or downward sloping even when there is a liquidity\npremium for long term interest rates.\n(b) False. Bonds with higher duration are more sensitive to changes in interest rates.\nIf we examine coupon bonds, all things equal a bond with a higher coupon rate\nwill have a lower duration and thus be less sensitive to changes in interest rates.\n4. False. The term structure depends on the expected path of interest rates (among other\nfactors): if interest rates are expected to fall, the term structure will slope downward.\n5. False. If there is liquidity premium, then a flat term structure means that investors\nexpect interest rates to fall.\nFall 2008\nPage 43 of 66\n\n6. No. To minimize interest rate risks, we want MD(A)×V(A) -MD(L)×V(L) = 0. If\nV(A)>V(L), we want MD(A) < MD(L).

The amount should\nbe based on how much you enter into a contract with the TA for.\nIf you follow these steps you will have more than enough to cover the short position\nin year 4 (since the rate you lend at is higher than the fair forward rate). Hence,\nthis is an arbitrage. The risks you are exposed are contract and counter-party\nrisk, for example the TA may go bankrupt before year 3 if he continues to enter\ninto contracts of this form and may not be able to honor his/her end.

Let the annual interest payment for the two-year forward loan be C. You can arrange\nthe loan and lock in the forward interest rate loan as follows\n- Buy $15M in par value of 1-year zero, costing (15M)(943.40/1000) = $14,151,000.\n- Sell $C in par value of 2-year zero, receiving $C × (898.47/1000)\n- Sell $C + 15M in par value of 3-year zero, receiving $(C + 15M)(847.62/1000)\n- Choose C such that proceeds from the selling of 2-year and 3-year zeros just cover\nthe cost of buying the 1-year zero.\nThus,\n(15M)(943.40/1000) = C(898.47/1000) + (C + 15M)(847.62/1000)\nwhich gives C = $822, 810. The CF's of the transactions are:\nTransaction\nCF today\nCF in year 1\nCF in year 2\nCF in year 3\nBuy 1-year zero\n-14,151,000\n15,000,000\nSell 2-year zero\n739,270\n-822,810\nSell 3-year zero\n13,411,730\n-15,822,810\nNet\n15,000,000\n-822,810\n-15,822,820\nThe forward interest rate for the 2-year forward loan is\nf = 822, 810/15, 000, 000 = 5.4854%\nwhich is locked in now.\n37.\n(a) The current price of the bond is\nP0 = $60\n1.065 +\n$60\n1.0652 + $1060\n1.0653 = $986.76\nYou can sell it in one year for\nP1 = $60\n1.065 + $1060\n1.0652 = $990.90\nBut there is also the $60 of coupon. So the total return is\nRoR = ($990.90 + $60)/$986.76 -1 = 6.5%\n(b) The bond now has the same coupon rate as the yield to maturity so it is trading\nat par. So the new price P1 = $1, 000 and\nRoR = ($1, 000 + $60)/$986.76 -1 = 7.4%\nFall 2008\nPage 51 of 66\n\n38.\n(a) D =\nP i=120\ni\n1.04i\nP i=120\n1.04i = 9.21 years\n(b) Need to match the duration and also the value of investment today should be\nequal to the total liabilities.

Bond underwriting\nIf the underwriter purchases the bonds from the corporate client, then it assumes\nthe full risk of being unable to resell the bonds at the stipulated offering price. In\nother words, the underwriter bears the risk of interest rate movement between the\ntime of purchase and the time of resale. For long maturity bonds, it is generally true\nthat its duration is also long. Thus, bonds with long maturities are more exposed\nto interest rate movement risk. Therefore, the underwriter demands a larger spread\n(higher underwriting fees) between the purchase price and stipulated offering price.\n48.\n(a) Use the formula that\nD =\nT\nX\nt=1\nt × wt where wt = CFt/(1 + y)t\nBondPrice\nDurations are 1.97, 4.61, 8.35, 14.13 for A through D, respectively.\n(b) You can either do this question by aggregating the cashflows as each time and\nusing an approach identical to what we did in part a. Here is an alternative.\nTo calculate the duration of a portfolio, it is easier to calculate its modified\nduration first.\nRecall that modified duration if MD = D/(1 + y) and that\n∆P/P = -MD × ∆y\nIs is not have to show that the modified duration of a portfolio is simply the\nweighted sum of the modified durations of the individual bonds where the weights\nare proportional to the value of the bond to the total value.\nFall 2008\nPage 53 of 66\n\nIn this case, the modified durations A through D are 1.85, 4.35, 7.88, and 13.33,\nrespectively.

The growth rate of dividend after year 4 is g2 = 0.10 · (1 -0.6) = 0.04.\nThe following tables give answers to part (a) (b) and (c). We see that today's price in\npart (a) is the same as that in part (c), but higher than that in part (b). The reason is\nthat the ROE after year 4 is the same as the cost of capital (both at 0.10). Therefore,\nafter year 4, it does not matter what the payout ratio is, and the price will remains the\nsame. However, since from year 1 to year 3, the ROE is higher than cost of capital,\na increase in payout ratio will reduce the growth rate of earnings (and dividends),\ntherefore, the price in part (b) is lower.\nFall 2008\nPage 59 of 66\n\nPrice and P/E\nYear\nBVPS0\nEPS\nDivPS\nBVPS1\nPrice\nP/E\n-\n-\n-\n100.000\n113.698\n-\n100.000\n15.000\n4.500\n110.500\n120.568\n7.274\n110.500\n16.575\n4.972\n122.103\n127.653\n6.970\n122.103\n18.315\n5.495\n134.923\n134.923\n10.000\n134.923\n13.492\n8.095\n140.320\n140.320\n10.000\nPayout Ration for the first three years is 0.3000, and is 0.600 after year 4.\nPrice and P/E\nYear\nBVPS0\nEPS\nDivPS\nBVPS1\nPrice\nP/E\n-\n-\n-\n100.000\n113.147\n-\n100.000\n15.000\n9.000\n106.000\n115.461\n7.262\n106.000\n15.900\n9.540\n112.360\n117.467\n6.970\n112.360\n16.854\n10.112\n119.102\n119.102\n10.000\n119.102\n11.910\n7.146\n123.866\n123.866\n10.000\nPayout Ration for the first three years is 0.6000, and is 0.600 after year 4.\nPrice and P/E\nYear\nBVPS0\nEPS\nDivPS\nBVPS1\nPrice\nP/E\n-\n-\n-\n100.000\n113.698\n-\n100.000\n15.000\n4.500\n110.500\n120.568\n7.274\n110.500\n16.575\n4.972\n122.103\n127.653\n6.970\n122.103\n18.315\n5.495\n134.923\n134.923\n10.000\n134.923\n13.492\n12.143\n136.272\n136.272\n10.000\nPayout Ration for the first three years is 0.3000, and is 0.900 after year 4.\n17.

Not available. We have at least two other questions very similar to this.\n26. The analyst uses a constant growth one-stage DCF model: P0 = DIV1/(r -g)\nBut the growth rate is actually going to decline over the next years. The analyst should\nuse a two-stage DCF analysis to value the company; assuming constant growth rate\nleads to overestimating the cost of capital. For example, if we assume that growth rate\nstays at 16% next year, but falls at 10% starting year 2, then the right discount rate\nis r such as $62 = 0.5/(1 + r) + 0.55/(r -0.1)/(1 + r) which leads to r = 10.81%\nFall 2008\nPage 63 of 66\n\n27.\n(a) The company should issue 200,000 shares.\n(b) The company's value with the new project is 50 +\n1.2\n0.12-0.03 = $63.3333 million.\nThe share price is then 63.3333\n1+0.2 = $52.78.\n(c) The NPV of the new project is\n1.2\n0.12-0.03 -10 = $3.3333 million.

It is not a fair offer. If you have market prices you should use them. NPV is just a\ntool to estimate market prices when they do not exist or market anomalies occur.\nValue per share from your aunt = share price-dividend foregone = 22-1.4/1.08 = $20.7\nMajor mistakes: a.

From the original valuation, we can find r = EPS/P = 12.5%\nNow if the earnings grow forever at 2.5%, then the new value is\nEPS1/(r-g) = 2.5*(1+2.5%)/(12.5%-2.5%) = 25.625 million\nSo the value of the company will increase by 5.625 million\n*Here we assumed the company always payout all the earnings as dividend.\n33.\n(a) g = ROE*b = 12%.

No. EPS is only growing at 12.7% for the next three years, not forever. The expected\nrate of return can only increase by less than that amount. In addition, there may be\na cost to the rapid growth (e.g. part of the current earnings may be retained), so the\nrate of return is lowered further.\n35. We will calculate the price of the stock a year from today. At that point, the firm can\neither not take the project or if it does, the project will reduce the current EPS by $3\nbut as a result the EPS moving forward will be higher by $3 × 20% = $0.6.\nIn the first case, the price is the PV of the perpetuity of $5 discounted at 10%. So\nP = $55 (note that the first earning is at time zero, but this is more of less a timing\nassumption and other assumption as long as clearly markes would be valid as well).\nIn the second case, the price is $2 plus the PV of a perpetuity of $5.6 starting in 1\nyear discounted at 10%. So price will be P = $58\n36. We assume that dividends are paid continuously and discounting is also done continu-\nously. We will divide each year into N parts each with length of 1/N.
