  "course_description": "This course applies the tools of anthropology to examine biology in the age of genomics, biotechnological enterprise, biodiversity conservation, pharmaceutical bioprospecting, and synthetic biology. It examines such social concerns such as bioterrorism, genetic modification, and cloning. It offers an anthropological inquiry into how the substances and explanations of biology—ecological, organismic, cellular, molecular, genetic, informatic—are changing. It examines such artifacts as cell lines, biodiversity databases, and artificial life models, and using primary sources in biology, social studies of the life sciences, and literary and cinematic materials, and asks how we might answer Erwin Schrodinger’s 1944 question, “What Is Life?” today.",

  "syllabus_content": "Course Meeting Times\n\nLectures: 1 session / week, 3 hours / session\n\nDescription\n\nIf the twentieth century was the century of physics, the twenty-first is becoming the century of biology. This subject examines the cultural, political, and economic dimensions of biology in the age of genomics, biotechnological enterprise, biodiversity conservation, pharmaceutical bioprospecting, and synthetic biology. Although we examine such social concerns as bioterrorism, genetic modification, and cloning, this is not a class in bioethics, but rather an anthropological inquiry into how the substances and explanations of biology--increasingly cellular, molecular, genetic, and informatic--are changing, and with them broader ideas about the relationship between \"nature\" and \"culture.\" Looking at such cultural artifacts as cell lines, biodiversity databases, and artificial life models, and using primary sources in biology, social studies of the life sciences, and literary and cinematic materials, we rephrase Erwin Schrodinger's famous 1944 question, \"What Is Life?\" to ask, in the early 2000s, \"What Is Life Becoming?\"\n\nPrerequisites\n\nNone.\n\nRequirements\n\nStudents will write three 7-page papers, choosing from a selection of topics to be provided by the instructor for each paper. Each paper represents 25% of the subject grade. Late papers lose a full grade a day. Students will also be evaluated on class participation, including the preparation of occasional reading notes to prompt class discussion as well as contribution to classroom conversation (25% of subject grade). Punctual attendance is obligatory. There is no final.\n\nGrading\n\nACTIVITIES\n\nPERCENTAGES\n\nPaper One\n\nPaper Two\n\nPaper Three\n\nClass Participation\n\nRequired Books\n\nKeller, Evelyn Fox.\nThe Mirage of a Space between Nature and Nurture\n.
