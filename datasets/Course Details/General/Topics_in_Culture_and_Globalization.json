  "syllabus_content": "Course Meeting Times\n\nLectures: 1 session / week, 3 hours / session\n\nCourse Description\n\nThe concept of globalization fosters the understanding of the interconnectedness of cultures and societies geographically wide apart. Subject scans existing debates over globalization throughout the world. Explores how globalization impacts everyday life in the First and Third World; how globalization leads to a common cosmopolitan culture; the emergence of a global youth culture; and religious, social, and political movements that challenge globalization. Materials examined include pop music, advertisements, ethnographic films, and journalistic accounts.\n\nTopics\n\nTopics for Fall 2003 include precursors to globalization, world hip-hop, media power, and consumer activism. Students will also have the opportunity to explore projects of their own design.\n\nCourse Requirements\n\nACTIVITIES\n\nPERCENTAGES\n\nDUE DATE\n\nDiscussion, Attendance\n\n15%\n\nEssay 1 (3 pages) - Cultural Power\n\n10%\n\nWeek 3\n\nEssay 2 (5 pages) - Global Hip-Hop\n\n15%\n\nWeek 8<\n\nEssay 3 (5 pages) - Media Worlds\n\n15%\n\nWeek 1\n\nIndividual Presentations\n\n15%\n\nWeeks 10-13\n\nFinal Paper (6-8 pages)\n\n25%\n\nast Class\n\nThere will be\nno final exam\n.\n\nGraduate students are required to do extra work as determined by the instructor. Extra work will usually take the form of extra reading and writing.\n\nCourse Dynamics\n\nThe course meets once a week and is structured by reading, films, lectures, discussions, and student presentations. In general, class will begin with lecture, then move to films, discussions, and presentations.\n\nCourse Requirements\n\nWriting\n\nThere will be four significant writing assignments: Two 5-page essays (due in Weeks 5 and 9), and a 7-8 page final project due on the last day of class. You will have a choice of essay topics, or with the approval of the instructor, they may be developed from the issues raised in the weekly discussions. I am happy to look at preliminary drafts of papers, but except for unusual circumstances, I do not accept rewrites. I would also encourage people to make use of the Writing Center as it is an excellent resource.\n\nGrading\n\nPapers will be graded according to three criteria:\n\nArgument\nIs this thesis clearly stated? Do the steps of the argument make sense and lead logically to the conclusion?\n\nEvidence\nHow well does the essay use the evidence available from the class materials (readings, lectures, films)? Are there contradictory examples that should be discussed to eliminate doubts? How well are the examples used to support the argument?\n\nStyle\nHow well is the paper written? Has it been carefully proofread? Are there clever turns of phrase, interesting transitions, a catchy opening and conclusion? Does the paper length match the assignment?\n\nShort Weekly Assignments\n\nDepending on how the class is progressing, I reserve the right to assign short weekly assignments, such as brief writing exercises, or to ask certain students to prepare discussion questions, or to lead discussion of the readings.\n\nAttendance and Class Participation\n\nBecause this class meets only once a week,\nyour attendance is required every single class period.\nBarring sickness or unavoidable family emergencies, I expect you in class. If you are going to miss class, I would like an email explanation prior to class.\nMore than two (2) unexcused absence will result in a reduction of your final grade.\nI do not give warnings in the event that you are in danger of such a penalty. That said, if emergencies or health situations arise, please let me know, if possible beforehand, and in most situations that will count as an excuse. Your health, and your commitments to family, should take priority over coursework.\n\nStudent Presentations\n\nI would also stress that student presentations form a key component of the course. Students will be asked to make short presentations, either formally or as part of discussion, throughout the term as a way of delving into the readings, films, and lectures. I encourage you to use such opportunities to introduce the class as a whole to examples of culture and globalization that may not be directly treated in the reading assignments or lectures.\n\nWith a topic like \"Culture and Globalization,\" there is clearly no way for a one-semester class to be comprehensive, nor give a full overview of the issues involved. Instead, we will focus on developing the analytical tools necessary to unravel some of the complex economic, political and cultural changes of the contemporary world with respect to globalization. In order to accomplish this, the course will rely to a large extent on the work of you, the students, to bring concrete, up-to-date examples which we can use to assess the theoretical readings and reconsider their conclusions in light of our examples.\n\nSpecial Class Meetings\n\nOnce or twice during the term, I may try to schedule special events related to the course. If these events fall outside of the regular class meeting times, they will be recommended, but optional. If your schedule precludes you from attending, I will design alternative assignments on a case-by-case basis.",

One after another, newcomer rappers grab the\nmic and shout a minute or two of their rhymes before someone else dives in and\nstarts it again. Most of the rappers, in their late teens to mid-twenties, are men,\nbut a couple women try out too. It's a free for all, ruled by the ability to hold the\nstage through a clever turn of phrase and a catchy delivery. Then there's a pause\nas one of the more well-known rappers takes the front. The scritch-scratch of the\nDJ's turntable counts time as Gaku-MC holds the microphone to his lips:\n\"Moriagatten no ka?\" (\"Are you having fun yet?\"). Gaku tries to move the crowd\nby screaming \"Yo!\" but we've been exhorted by the previous 15 freestyle MCs to\nyell \"Ho!\" a few too many times. Gaku has his work cut out for him. \"Do you\nECD, \"Intro\" on his album Big Youth (1997, Cutting Edge, CTCR-14075). Although spoken on\nthe album by ECD, the lyrics were written by Egaitsu Hiroshi, a writer and DJ.\n\nIntroduction -- 2\nknow what FG stands for?\" he yells. \"Funky Grammar!\" yells the crowd. This is\nthe name of the hip-hop collective which organized this event. \"Eeh?\" says Gaku.\nThe crowd, louder: \"Funky Grammar!!\" Still not enough, Gaku demands another\nresponse. Then he signals to DJ Yoggy that he's ready and the opening riff of the\nJackson Five's \"ABC\" starts up, looped over and over as the DJ switches back and\nforth between two records on parallel turntables. Gaku gets his freestyle going,\nsyncopating his rhymes against the catchy track, referring to the club, the heat,\nand the sweat drenching everyone's clothes. The flow of his lyrics gives us all a\nbounce, as he says he's going \"show us his manhood,\" punning on \"sweat\" as a\nreference to sex, threatening to take of his clothes, then saying, \"if you feel like I\ndo, bring your voice together with mine and yell!\" Now we're all moving, and\nwith an explosive yell, we throw our hands forward and scream. Gaku says, \"Yo,\npeace, I'm out\" and he leaves the stage. We in the audience smile and nod to each\nother. This is what we came for.\nAlthough we will explore the history of hip-hop in Japan in more detail as\nthe book progresses, it is worth noting that the style has undergone momentous\nchanges since being introduced to Tokyo audiences with the showing of the film\nWild Style in 1983, a movie depicting New York City graffiti artists, breakdancers,\nrappers and DJs. Inspired by that film, and bolstered by breakdance images in\nthe film Flashdance, some Tokyo youth began gathering every Sunday at Yoyogi\nPark, where musicians and others perform on the streets every weekend.\nThrough the 1980s, a growing number of clubs and some radio slots began\nfocusing on hip-hop and by the end of the 1980s, some rap albums in Japanese\nwere appearing on record store shelves. But at that time, many Japanese\nquestioned with hip-hop would ever take root in the land of the rising sun. When\n\nIntroduction -- 3\nI began this research during a summer trip to Tokyo in 1994, I interviewed music\nmagazine editors, record company representatives, and some musicians, many of\nwhom doubted that hip-hop could ever catch on in Japan. According to the\nskeptics, the Japanese language was ill-suited to rapping, there was no true street\nculture, the musicians were simply trying to be little New Yorkers, and their\nunderstanding of the urban, largely African-American social and cultural settings\nout of which hip-hop emerged was superficial if not completely misguided. Hip-\nhop in Japan was simply faddish consumerism, they said, and, like any passing\nfashion, would disappear like bell-bottom jeans. They were wrong. In 2003, hip-\nhop is one of the fastest growing genres of music in Japan, and it has spawned a\nwidespread engagement with hip-hop performers and fans in the U.S., in Asia,\nand around the world. Some hip-hop musicians who spent a decade or more\nworking day jobs while pursuing their music careers can now make a living as\nmusicians, appearing on TV shows, in commercials, and finally garnering major\nrecord label contracts and promotion. In the early 1990s, rappers and DJs were\nstruggling to educate their audiences about what hip-hop is, explaining at shows\nand in magazines the \"four elements\" of breakdance, graffiti, rap and DJing, its\norigins in New York City in the 1970s, the characteristics of rap flow and\nrhyming, and the musical production style based largely on sampling and mixing.\nBut by the end of the 1990s, as one DJ said to me, \"Even old grandmothers have a\nnotion of what a DJ is.\" In 2003, some Japanese rappers are bragging about\ndriving in Cadillac SUVs and wearing platinum chains, while others condemn\n\"pop idol\" rappers as a discredit to the music. In the early years of the twenty-\nfirst century, there has been an explosion of different styles, an emergence of\ndiverse regional takes on the music, and a burgeoning underground scene is\n\nIntroduction -- 4\nproviding a new perspective on Japan, as rappers criticize the status quo and\nimagine a better future. Over time, hip-hop has become a central feature of the\nJapanese popular culture scene, and having studied it for close to 10 years, I\nwould argue that it tells us something about the emerging dynamics of\ntransnational cultures, and suggests ways that cultural politics may be\nincreasingly important for understanding the workings of power in the economy,\ngovernment, and society in today's world.\nAlthough it may seem strange to some people that there are hip-hop\nmusicians in Japan, it is hardly unusual. In cities around the world, youth are\nadopting the fashion and the musical style as their own. One can now hear rap\nmusic in dozens of languages, including French, Italian, German, Korean, and\nJapanese. There are even Basque separatists, Maori tribesmen, Australian\naboriginals, young Tanzanians, and Native Americans producing their own rap\nmusic. 2 Although distinctive features of each group's, indeed each artist's, style\ncan be identified, it is difficult to ignore the apparent dominance of American\npop culture. After all, these musicians call themselves MCs and DJs, and they\nidentify themselves as part of a global hip-hop culture that originated in the\nUnited States. In some ways, foreign appropriations of hip-hop seem to prove\nthat American entertainment industries have the power to determine other\npeople's expressive styles, if not in terms of what they say, at least in terms of\nhow they present themselves and how they evaluate others. In Japan, local\nrappers clearly adopt the clothing, body language, and sometimes even the\nheavy jewelry of American rappers they see on MTV. If some kind of \"world\n2 See Mitchell (2001). Tanzanian rap is discussed in Weiss (2002).\n\nIntroduction -- 5\nculture\" is developing, it does seem to be appearing in clothing, music genres,\nand leisure styles among relatively well-to-do urban youth around the globe.\nEven so, the assertion of American dominance begs the question: To what\nextent is hip-hop in Japan \"American\"? As a growing number of people in Japan\nand elsewhere conceive of themselves as part of a global hip-hop movement,\nthere are ways in which the Americanness of hip-hop is becoming increasingly\nattenuated, in part because hip-hoppers everywhere express the importance of\ngrounding their music in the realities of one's language, one's crew and one's\n'hood. Moreover, for the Japanese who are attached to the music, hip-hop is\nviewed as \"black culture\" not \"American culture,\" which highlights the racial\nand ethnic dimensions of the music much more than its national origin. America\nis still a central reference point, with New York City of the late 1970s recognized\nas the origin (genten) of hip-hop. The American market also remains the most\ncommercially successful and the largest productive center for the genre today.\nBut as time goes by, the younger generation of Japanese listeners are increasingly\nhearing hip-hop in the Japanese language, speaking to issues and topics of their\nown lives, and raising the possibility that eventually hip-hop will be seen as\nJapanese as karaoke. This tension between hip-hop as black and American and\nhip-hop as transracial and transnational highlights one dimension of its\nimportance, namely, as a window on the character of cultural dialogue in today's\nworld.\nTo some people, this dialogue is little more than shoplifting. A writer for\nVibe magazine, based in the U.S., discusses Japanese reggae and hip-hop with a\njaundiced eye, asking, \"Where is the line between cultural appropriation and\ncultural theft?\" (Dreisinger 2002: 134). In Japan as well, some commentators\n\nIntroduction -- 6\nview the attempts to make hip-hop more Japanese paramount to promoting a\ndangerous nationalism that denies the racially charged underpinnings of the\nmusic (Asahi-Shimbun 1999). Such attitudes point to the importance of looking\nat popular culture not merely as an example of media power, but as a window\non some of the things that are most meaningful to the daily lives of Japanese. As\nhip-hop grows in visibility and popularity in Japan, we can use this as a case\nstudy to evaluate the music's social and cultural ramifications. A series of\nquestions suggests some of the ways this debate relates to race, language,\nnationalism, and globalization in trying to evaluate the power of transnational\npopular culture. Is Japanese hip-hop innovative cultural production or merely\nimitation? Is this resistance to, or complicity with, entertainment industry\ncapitalism? Is this the emergence of a \"global hip-hop culture,\" or merely the\nlatest foreign cultural style to be seamlessly integrated into \"Japanese culture\"? Is\nthis the spread of \"Western-style consumerism\" or a process of\n\"Americanization\"? Is it the mark of a new, emerging \"Empire\" that is\ntransnational in scope but not centered in any particular nation? What kind of\nsocial and cultural effects are associated with the spread of music styles? What\ndrives the spread of these styles, and to what extent is it \"top-down\" or \"bottom\nup\"? (Indeed, what is the \"top\"? America? Media conglomerates? Dr. Dre?) If\nit is \"bottom-up,\" organically emerging from local artists, lifeways, and politics,\ndoes this mean we have nothing to fear from the consolidation of media\nbusinesses and the transnational spread of popular culture? One premise of this\nbook is that we cannot decide these questions by abstract reasoning alone. The\nsignificance of Japanese hip-hop emerges from the actual practices of the\nproducers and consumers, from what the music communicates, and through its\n\nIntroduction -- 7\ncirculation, both as business and as cultural form. Not surprisingly, the uses of\npopular culture in society are perhaps best characterized by a deep ambivalence,\na foundational questioning of the relationships between identities and\nexpression, between conflicted histories and imagined futures, and between\ndiverse, contested local arenas swept up in the currents of global flows.\nThis case study of Japanese hip-hop, through an approach based on\nfieldwork and ethnography, can help us answer these and other key questions\nfor cultural studies suited to today's world. If the twentieth century\ndemonstrated the power of the nation-state as ideology and organization with\nboth destructive and creative potential, it seems as if this new century demands\nthat we grapple with the interconnections that cross national borders, whether as\ndiffuse terrorist networks and military complexes, multinational corporations,\ninternational non-governmental organizations, global media conglomerates, or\nas transnational social and cultural movements. It is clear that cultural\nconnections do not end at national boundaries, yet to understand what these new\nconnections mean requires extending our understanding of culture in new\ndirections. Studying Japan through the voices of hip-hop music provides a stage\nfrom which to unravel the kinds of gestures toward dialogue that create new\nbridges and define new boundaries.\nJapan provides a key locale for studying these problems in part because it\nis a key nexus for the consumption and production of popular culture styles, but\nalso because of its central position in international political economy. Japan is\nthe second largest economy, and the second largest music market, in the world,\nyet it is facing a crisis in capitalism and challenges to its democracy that\nilluminate problems which people around the world face. Japan provokes\n\nIntroduction -- 8\ndebate in part because of its contradictory character as a non-Western, capitalist,\npost-industrial nation, the envy of Asia during its postwar economic boom, but\nnow suffering a debilitating, decade-long recession. Despite an aging\npopulation, affected by low birth rates and a long life expectancy, Japan boasts a\nvibrant youth culture that is often at the center of arguments about how Japan is\nchanging. To a striking degree the question of the place of consumerism among\nyouth has become a lightening rod for anxieties about Japan as the land of the\nsetting sun. Although today's twentysomethings grew up during the economic\nheyday of the 1980s \"bubble economy,\" they witnessed the steady decline of\nJapan's economic fortunes during the 1990s, and are now facing troubling job\nprospects. Youth are paradoxically viewed as both a cause and a product of\ndifficult economic times, and as symbolic of some disturbing relationships\ntowards capitalism. A relatively new social category, that of the \"freeter\"\n(furiitaa), which refers to youthful part time workers in dead end service industry\njobs, has been regarded in the media and government reports as a symbol of\n\"lack of commitment\" to working, while these people also exhibit a slavish\ndevotion to crass consumerism. Although the audience for Japanese hip-hop is\nrapidly spreading into the mainstream, most of the fans at live shows tend to be\ncollege students or self-described freeter. Teenage girls in the 1990s were also the\nfocus of a moral panic, as high school prostitution rings, teen girls' \"paid dates\"\nwith older men (not necessarily including sex), and a rash of brand name\nconsumerism made headlines. Youth, consumerism, and a discomforting\nentrepreneurial spirit among girls who, in their school uniforms, considered\nthemselves a \"brand name\" item, all came together as symbols a crisis in the\neconomic realm that was seen to have as much to do with an unsettling\n\nIntroduction -- 9\ncommodification of youth vitality and sexuality as with non-performing bank\nloans (Iida 2000; Miyadai 1994). While the media focused on the failure of\nparents and the dubious morals of these young women, youth throughout Japan\nwere facing declining job prospects, an uncertain future, and the broken promise\nthat years of hard studying would result in a comfortable adulthood. In this\nsetting, Japanese hip-hoppers sought to stake out a space of performance that\ndrew inspiration from hip-hop's outsider status and oppositional spirit, in effort\nto speak to an audience that had grown disillusioned with the pop icons\ndominating the mainstream media. In some ways, they seek to reclaim their\nidentity by proclaiming that it is not what they sell, nor what they consume that\ndefines who they are; rather, it is what they have to say.\nWhat I have learned from these musicians is that their creative approaches\nto expressing themselves can help us develop new ways of thinking about the\nrelationships between culture and place, culture and the economy, and culture\nand power. It is these three dimensions of cultural analysis that animate the\nargument which follows. Japanese hip-hop illustrates that these concerns are not\nsimply the province of academic cultural theorists, but are also actively debated\nin the construction of identities that seek to build on the ground of changing\nsocieties, while drawing on a wide array of cultural resources to imagine a\ndifferent future. My strategy is to work outwards from the particular practices\nand understandings that motivate Japanese rappers. My hope is that this project\ncan awaken us to the kinds of transnational cultural politics that offer new\npossibilities in a world that, for better and worse, is becoming increasingly\ninterconnected.\n\nIntroduction -- 10\nPLACE\n\"The Power from the Sky\" (King Giddra, 1996)\nWhen the rappers Zeebra and K Dub Shine along with DJ Oasis were\nthinking about a name for their group, they wanted something with an\ninternational cachet, a Japanese flavor, and also a specific perspective towards\nmainstream Japanese society. Zeebra describes in a music magazine interview\nwhy they settled on King Giddra, a three-headed space monster that battles\nGodzilla in one of the many films of that series.\nFirst, we realized Godzilla is an international character that would\nrepresent (repurezento) an international Japan. But Godzilla himself, he's\ntoo much everywhere, so we settled on King Giddra. It's exactly us as a\nthree-person group. Also, in the movie King Giddra is the bad guy, but as\na public enemy (paburikku enamii) he's doing an extremely positive thing,\nright? That is, as an enemy of the public, we are an enemy of the system\nthat oppresses us. We see the system as the enemy, and for us, Godzilla is\nthe system. We're like \"planetary defense forces\" (laughs). For those who\ndon't understand, we've come to tell the truth. (Kido 1996: 42)\nFor them, King Giddra offered a symbol that is both international and Japanese.\nIt is becoming a truism to assert that the local and the global are not exclusive\ncategories but that they operate in a dialectical relationship, each informing the\nother. As Jennifer Robertson (1997) finds in her analysis of the interactive\nrelationship between Japan's efforts to internationalize and at the same time to\nrevitalize rural towns as furusato, or nostaligic repositories of native Japan. She\nquotes a Japanese sociologist, Kurita Isamu, who makes the following\n\nIntroduction -- 11\nconnection: \"the international-ness of the lifestyle makes the traditional Japanese\narts appear quite alien and exotic. We look at our tradition the way a foreigner\ndoes, and we are beginning to love it\" (Robertson 1997: 97). Other scholars have\nanalyzed Japan's distinctive understandings of cultural change in terms of\nlooking forward and back in terms of \"rationalization and nostalgia\" (Kelly\n1986), or as a discourse of vanishing cultural forms (Ivy 1988). But for King\nGiddra, they recognize that the border between \"foreign\" and \"Japanese\" is\nprecisely what is being drawn into question by their efforts as Japanese rappers,\nas well as in the style of producing music which relies on samples from other\npeople's recordings.\nZeebra: The idea is that we are not looking at the world as if we are on the\nplanet, but from the perspective of being apart from it and looking down.\nWith that meaning, we chose the title \"power from the sky.\" . . .\nK Dub Shine: There was also an element of the unexpected in choosing\nthe title and the name King Giddra. Partly it was just that when we were\ndoing some scratches of a Public Enemy song, \"Black Steel in the Hour of\nChaos,\" we took the part \"power from the sky / From the tower shots\nrang out.\" (Interview with the author, April 1996)\nThe practices of sampling as a new model of cultural creativity, and the\nunderstanding that Japan is not the only source for their identity, nor the only\ntarget for their expressions, illustrates two aspects of the rethinking of the\nrelationship between identity and place in Japanese hip-hop. George Marcus\nsuggests the term \"the activist imaginary\" to describe how indigenous groups\ncan use media in part out of a desire for \"emancipatory projects . . . raising fresh\nissues about citizenship and the shape of public spheres\" (Marcus 1996) quoted\n\nIntroduction -- 12\nin (Ginsburg, et al. 2002a: 8). Yet the liberation that is sampled from and the\nliberation imagined by King Giddra is quite different. The Public Enemy song\ndetails a prison escape from death row, and \"power of the sky\" refers to\ngunshots from the guard towers. For King Giddra, they are the power from the\nsky, celebrating their movement above and beyond the boundaries of nation as\nthey imagine and articulate a new Japan, and perhaps eventually even speaking\nto fans beyond Japan's borders.\nWhat is \"the system\" that they seem themselves opposing? On their 1995\nalbum, they have sharp words for Japan's \"credentials society\" that emphasizes\nrote learning for school entrance exams. Saying it \"crushes the dreams of\nchildren,\" they criticize both the \"education mamas\" who force their kids to\nstudy and the students themselves who buy into the idea that educational\nperseverance will land them a good job after college. Zeebra even raps about\nrecent government statistics showing that one in four college grads remain\nunemployed. In a live show held outside in 1996, K Dub Shine calls on the\naudience to scream at the Ministry of Health, which was visible from\namphitheater, to protest the scandal surrounding blood tainted with HIV that the\nMinistry tried to cover up. The themes, and the at times hectoring attitude this\nalbum takes towards its audience, suggests some of the ways that the global style\nof hip-hop is used to engage local concerns, but to conclude that this is simply\nanother way that globalization does not lead to simple homogenization is to\noversimplify the dialogue that produces rap in Japan.\nOne of the recent challenges for cultural studies has been reconceiving the\nrelationship between culture and place, as processes of globalization intensify the\ncontacts and collisions between cultural practices. It is worth noting that the\n\nIntroduction -- 13\nmovement of cultural forms across geographical boundaries has a long history,\nas long, no doubt, as the history of humanity. Yet the rise of the nation-state, and\nthe linkage of the imagined communities of nation with the institutions of state\ngovernments, has solidified ways of thinking about culture as bounded\ngeographically, and as part of the instrumentality that lends coherence to the\nworld system (Anderson 1991; Wallerstein 1976). The oft-cited homogeneity of\nJapan, which carries troubling racial overtones and is problematic for smoothing\nover the diversity within the society, is nonetheless still used as explanation for\nboth domestic politics and attitudes towards other nations, for example with\nrespect to immigration and trade policies. This linking of place and national\ncharacter is promoted by Japanese as well, in a large body of writing known as\nnihonjinron (\"theory of Japanese people\") (Befu 2001). According to this line of\nwriting, Japan is characterized by homogeneity, in race and in national character,\nand as such is best understood through its contrasts with the West. Ironically,\nthe Japanese rappers who work to highlight the social injustices disguised by\nsuch assertions of homogeneity are criticized by pundits for not having any\nground to stand on because they are just middle class kids, like everyone else in\nJapan, and their use of hip-hop is simple as a fashion statement. \"To the youth\nwho are flocking to hip-hop culture simply as a style, in Shibuya and Harajuku, I\nfeel strongly this sense of incompatibility. And even if one sticks up one's\nmiddle finger with a big 'fuck you,' it only leaves a chill.\" (Tachikawa 2002).\nWhen Japanese youth express their affiliation with hip-hop culture, and their\nenchantment with black expressive styles in film, music videos, and on TV, it is\nclear that this transnational and transracial imaginary disrupts our linkage of\nculture to place and specific people. Yet one wonders about the extent to which\n\nIntroduction -- 14\nthis imagined affiliation is actualized in changing social and cultural patterns of\norganization?\nOne element of the debate about the deterritorialization of cultural forms\nconcerns the question of whether some kind of cultural homogenization is\nunderway. On one hand, it seems as if diverse locales are becoming increasingly\nthe same. It is more than a little eerie to fly from New York to Tokyo and see\nteenagers in both places wearing the same kinds of fashion characteristic of rap\nfans: baggy pants with boxers on display, floppy hats or baseball caps, and\nimmaculate space-age sneakers. In Shibuya, Tokyo's trendy shopping district for\nyouth, rap music is the background sound of choice. Graffiti styled after the\nNew York City aerosol artists dons numerous walls, posters, and the interiors of\nstores. In public parks, it is common to see breakdancers practicing their styles\neither in the afternoon or late in the evening. In all-night dance clubs throughout\nTokyo, Japanese rappers and DJs take to the stage and declare that they have\nsome \"extremely bad shit\" (geki yaba shitto) -- meaning \"good music\" -- to share\nwith the audience. In music magazines, on the radio and more recently on TV,\nJapanese rappers discuss how \"hip-hop culture\" can interact with Japanese\nidentity, thus drawing on the past while creating something new in a\ntranscultural arena. For many urban youth, hip-hop is the defining style of the\nera. In the 1970s, the paradigm of high school cool was long hair and a blistering\nsolo on lead guitar. Today, trendsetters are more likely to sport \"dread\" hair and\nshow off their scratch techniques with two turntables and a mixer. But at the\nsame time, there are reasons to think that such surface appearances of sameness\ndisguise differences at some deeper levels.\n\nIntroduction -- 15\nIndeed, there is growing body of scholarship demonstrating that initial\nfears of cultural imperialism were misplaced. Even the leading icons of\nAmericanization - McDonald's and Disneyland - are reinterpreted when\ntransposed to Asian settings (Brannen 1992; Raz 1999; Watson 1997). In Taiwan,\nstudents appropriate McDonalds as a youth hangout, undermining any\nsemblance of \"fast food.\" In Beijing, McDonalds is a luxury restaurant of sorts,\nand in Japan, children who have grown up with Makudonarudo, as it is called,\nseldom recognize its American origins. There is even a verb in Japanese \"to go to\nMcDonalds\" (makudoru). Visitors to Tokyo Disneyland meet a vastly expanded\nshopping area, compared to Disneyland in the U.S., in part because the Japanese\nare culturally obligated to buy more gifts for family and friends than is common\nfor American visitors. Moreover, the narrative that dominates the layout of\nDisneyland in the U.S. is subtly transformed in the Tokyo version. One might\nthink that the question of whether a given phenomena represents \"global\nhomogenization\" or \"local heterogenization\" is primarily a matter of scale. But\nwhile it is true that any supposedly global phenomena will reveal local\ncharacteristics if one simply \"zooms in\" for a more fine-grained perspective, it\nshould also become apparent that the question of whether something is \"global\"\nor \"local\" ignores the important question of the nature and consequences of the\nmixture that occurs. In other words, it is becoming clear that the importation of\nAmerican cultural products does not lead to a simple Americanization, but how\nthen can we understand the influence?\nTo return to the example of King Giddra's first album, their themes\nsuggest a \"local\" perspective appropriate to Japanese hip-hop, yet at the same\ntime the music and the lyrics are also mixed with foreign elements. The backing\n\nIntroduction -- 16\ntrack features samples from Public Enemy (\"the power from the sky\") and the\nBeastie Boys (\"Get ready, 'cause this ain't funny\"), as well as other Western\nmusic, thus making explicit the connection to a larger hip-hop world. King\nGiddra's lyrics portray their discovery of American hip-hop in underground\nTokyo record shops and their desire to spread the culture in Japan, which they\nsee as involving \"planetary defense\" through the use of \"the bullet of truth that\nredirects brain cells.\" In contrast to much Japanese popular music which\nfrequently incorporates English words into the chorus, these rappers' use of only\nthe Japanese language suggests a strongly national orientation, and yet the\nJapanese they use is altered from standard Japanese by adding rhythmic stress\nthat the language does not ordinarily possess. Their dense rhyming style,\ncommon to almost all Japanese rappers, is a feature of largely absent from\nJapanese poetics. Neither wholly global nor entirely local, the music enacts a\ncertain kind of engagement with Japanese language and cultural politics that\ngains its force from both global and local references. It would be a mistake,\ntherefore, to view all localizing practices as \"resistance\" to global\nhomogenization, because what is of significance is how both local and global\ndynamics are interwoven. Moreover, these global and local contexts are\nchanging as the interest in hip-hop from other countries expands, and as cross-\nfertilization among diverse scenes becomes more widespread. Even American\nrappers are increasingly adding Japanese words to their raps, after years of\ntouring in Japan have generated a familiarity with the language.\nJonathan Friedman argues that an adequate \"global anthropology\" must\nmaintain a perspective in which \"cultural processes are understood as embedded\nin life worlds, life spaces, and social experiences that are themselves susceptible\n\nIntroduction -- 17\nto analysis\" (1994: vii). The point is that even though we can be amazed by the\nspectacular hybridity of transnational cultural forms and identities, they do not\nappear out of nowhere, but are produced by particular people living out their\nlives at the crossroads of both global and local forces. It is clear that cultures and\nplaces are still related, but the relationship cannot be characterized simply by\ndrawing new geographical boundaries. Indeed, what is particularly striking\nabout the global hip-hop nation is that it overlaps (or tunnels through) other\ncultural groupings in a way that challenges to distinguish the ways that \"local\" is\nnot always \"Japanese,\" as when K Dub Shine represents his Shibuya\nhomeground, or Zeebra, as in later solo efforts, calls himself as the \"Jonan\nhustler,\" referring to a rather upscale section of Tokyo. These situated references\n- the local within the national within the global - point to the importance of\ndeveloping readings of culture that move beyond an \"area studies\" approach, in\nthe sense that there are overlapping cultural orientations within and across areas.\nThis is one of the burning questions for cultural analysis, not only in the interest\nof deepening our understanding of culture, but also for giving us the analytical\ntools to approach a shrinking world with ever increasing points of cultural\ncontact, exchange, and conflict.\nIf culture is no longer bound to specific geographical locations or even\nspecific groups of people, then how are we to conceive of culture? It is becoming\nmore widely accepted that culture is not something seamlessly inherited from\none's forbears, but rather is constructed through processes of reproduction and\ntransformation. Instead of viewing culture as a bounded, coherent totality,\nshared more or less equally by all members of a group, it makes more sense to\nview culture as a field of negotiated meanings. These meanings are shared only\n\nIntroduction -- 18\nto some extent and are shot through with contradictions and ambiguity. Rather\nthan rehearsing the various critiques of the \"culture concept,\" I would simply\nlike to point out that the culture cannot be defined in a way that will please all,\nand this should be clear for hip-hop fans as well, who constantly debate the true\nmeaning of hip-hop culture. What is important is that a focus on culture allows\nus to see a certain dimension of human existence, one that is given too little\nattention in fields of economics and politics, especially in an era where the media\nand entertainment capitalism increasingly revolve around cultural meanings.\nJean and John Comaroff offer a working definition of culture as\nthe space of signifying practice, the semantic ground on which human\nbeings seek to construct and represent themselves and others - and hence,\nsociety and history. . . . It has form as well as content; is born in action as\nwell as thought; is a product of human creativity as well as mimesis; and,\nabove all, is empowered. But it is not all empowered in the same way, or\nall of the time (Comaroff and Comaroff 1991: 21)\nThus, if we consider the ways that culture draws our attention to the meanings\nthat guide people's actions, and the ways practices and experiences reinforce (or\ncontradict) those meanings, we can see how cultural studies provides a certain\ncontext for analysis. What is clear is that in some ways this space of signifying\npractice is less and less constrained by the limits of geography, and in this sense,\nthe deterritorialization of culture is a very real phenomenon. Japanese\nmusicians hear the latest music from the U.S. within weeks of releases in New\nYork and L.A. They follow closely the styles of the different producers,\ncomparing themselves to DJ Premier, Swizz Beats, Timbaland, and the RZA.\nThere is a global connectivity in this sonic realm, mediated on vinyl, but inspired\n\nIntroduction -- 19\nby the recombinatory potential of digital remixing equipment. The challenge is\nto find ways of characterizing culture without relying exclusively on the\ntautology that the culture of a place (e.g., Japan) is that which happens in that\nplace (e.g., the Japanese islands). It is also worth underscoring that the ways\nculture empowering is one of the more pressing concerns for cultural theory.\nThis helps explain some of the importance in Arjun Appadurai's\nformulation for analyzing global cultural flows. In moving beyond an analysis of\n\"political, economic, and cultural\" globalization, he focuses instead on media\nand migration as two globalized features of modernity. As Louisa Schein (1999)\nhas written,\nhis emphasis is on the mobility - of persons, of signs - effected through\nthese contemporary modes . . . His key point is not that people live\nincreasingly similar lives under modernity but, rather, that they can\nimagine - and sometimes actualize - more and more different lives\nthrough the potentials of media consumption and geographic mobility.\n(Schein 1999: 362-363)\nI would like to draw attention to the term \"actualize\" because this seems to me to\nbe the central question. For Schein, the rural Miao minority in China actualize\nmodernity through contradictory performances, at weddings for example, which\nshow how their assigned identity as \"traditional\" by majority Chinese is\nnegotiated and transformed to incorporate symbols of modernity. Schein's\ninnovation is to draw our attention to how a focus on modernity as something\nperformed can help us understand how people actualize their identity through\nspecific, contextualized uses of global styles and practices. Most importantly,\n\nIntroduction -- 20\nperhaps, she demonstrates that understanding these signs of modernity requires\nsituating their uses in the everyday lives of the Miao.\nAppadurai maps the mobility, through media and migration, by\nintroducing the idea of a disjuncture between different \"-scapes\" of global flows,\nwhich he divides into people, media, technology, finance, and ideologies. His\nmodel emphasizes the disjunctures between these \"-scapes\" by arguing that they\nare \"non-isomorphic.\" In other words, flows of money (financescapes) do not\nnecessarily entail flows of ideas (ideoscapes). Appadurai's goal was to suggest\nthat different locales and topics entail a different mix in the importance of each of\nthese \"-scapes.\" He pointed out, for example, that the Japanese are very open to\nflows of ideas, but fairly closed to immigration. Unfortunately, few people have\ntaken up this insight, and instead the main use of Appadurai has been to choose\na single \"-scape\" and focus on it, or, alternatively, to invent new -scapes, such as\n\"sacriscapes\" for religious diasporas (Waters 1995), \"sportscapes\" of professional\nsports, \"foodscapes,\" and so on. The point that these phenomena spread beyond\nnational boundaries, and the desire to map these emerging formations is fine in\nand of itself, but the proliferation of such -scapes raises the question: Is there\nsome way these different dimensions of flows be connected together?\nResponding to this challenge requires shifting the emphasis in our interest\nin the deterritorialization of cultural forms away from identifying \"global\" and\n\"local\" features of transnational styles and instead turn our attention to\nanalyzing the ways in which such styles are embedded in certain social contexts.\nUnderstanding this embeddedness should not solely depend upon bringing out\nthe \"local\" elements, but could better serve our understanding of cultural power\nby interrogating the ways that commercialism and cultural politics of Japanese\n\nIntroduction -- 21\nhip-hop engage with broader social, political, and economic changes within\nJapan, and even beyond Japan's borders. In other words, while the efforts to\nshow how cultural globalization is not leading to a simple homogenization of\nculture have been important, the burning question for today's cultural analysis\nrevolves around the question of how the new cultural movements articulate with\ncapitalism and politics in a globally networked world.\nECONOMICS\n\"Protect Him (from what he wants)\" -- Scha Dara Parr (1993)\nFor improving our understanding of the link between culture and\ncapitalism, I would highlight two main issues. The first concerns the accusation\nthat Japanese youth have turned hip-hop culture merely into a fashion statement.\nAs critics like Yvonne Bynoe assert (2002), \"getting real\" about global hip-hop\nmeans acknowledging that the Japanese have largely turned hip-hop into an\nobject for consumption. A second, and related, question is how we can better\nunderstand the feedback loop between cultural production and consumption.\nFor if it is true that consumers increasingly drive today's entertainment\nindustries, how is this power exercised and what kind of power is it?\nOne perspective on the links between culture and capitalism in Japan's\nhyperconsumerist youth culture comes from a three-person group out of Tokyo.\nScha Dara Parr is one of the more successful Japanese hip-hop groups, building a\nstrong following through their distinctive style of wordplay and amusing songs.\nEven the name of their group is basically nonsense sounds, but which suggest\nsomeone with an empty head just wasting time. Composed of two brothers, Ani\n(MC) and Shinco (DJ) and frontman MC Bose, SDP has managed to keep\n\nIntroduction -- 22\nproducing albums, and touring successfully, throughout the 1990s, when most\nother Japanese rappers were struggling to make ends meet with day jobs.\nDuring the mid-1990s, Bose was one of the hosts of a popular TV show for\nchildren called \"Ponkiki Kids,\" and even the hardcore Japanese acts that take\nissue with SDP's humorous style give the group credit for bringing rap style to a\nvery young audience. The group's name is made of nonsense sounds SDP, as\nthe group is also known, express a more playful look at youth culture when\ncompared the dire portrayals of King Giddra, but their playfulness does not\npreclude a questioning of the consumerist obsessions of their fellow youth. In\none song called \"Protect Him (From What He Wants)\" (title in English), the\nprotagonist can't help himself from buying records, a music sampler, CDs and T-\nshirts at shows, and \"even more than he can carry.\" They rap, \"his basic\nprinciple: just buy it!\" (toriaezu katchau, sore ga kihon). That the SDP members\ncriticize blind consumerism may seem hypocritical, given that they are quite\nfashion-conscious themselves, but what is significant is the way that, through\ntheir music, they invent a world in which buying things may be important, but\nonly to the extent that it invigorates friendships with their peers. It is this theme\nwhich offers one of the more important entry points into a deeper understanding\nof Japanese rap music, namely, the question of defining alternative values in a\nworld in which capitalist exchange is increasingly viewed as the prime arbiter of\nvalue.\nCommercialism is an important topic for analyzing Japanese hip-hop in\npart because these Japanese B-Boys and B-Girls are most often dismissed by\noutside observers for turning hip-hop culture primarily into an object to\nconsume. With high-priced vinyl record boutiques, hair salons charging\n\nIntroduction -- 23\nupwards of $400 to create \"dread hair,\" nightclubs that cost around $30 to enter,\nand CDs made in Japan that cost almost double what they cost in the U.S., it is\neasy to say that the middle- and upper-middle-class youth who are attracted to\nhip-hop fail the test of \"keeping it real\" precisely because all the money changing\nhands lays bare the commercial backbone of the movement. Even to the extent\nthat hip-hop in the U.S. is \"all about the Benjamins\" in an era of \"bling bling\"\nmaterialism, as in the conspicuous display of platinum and diamond accessories,\nthere is an ethic of performance and lifestyle commitment that rejects spending\nmoney as the prime indicator of engagement with hip-hop. But as even this one\nexample from SDP illustrates, the Japanese are concerned with the dangerous\nrole of consumerism in youth culture as well. In some ways, the quickness with\nwhich American observers of Japanese hip-hop dismiss their efforts as \"merely\nconsumerist\" is best related to this stereotype of Japanese youth.\nConcerns about the place of economic relations replacing fuller, more\nmeaningful social relations is not unique to Japan, but Japanese youth are caught\nup in these debates in instructive ways. Japanese youth in the U.S. media are\ncurrently represented in a somewhat paradoxically as obsessive consumers and\nas lackadaisical laborers, perhaps representing a larger shift in our\nunderstanding of contemporary capitalism as driven increasingly driven by\nconsumption rather than production. In Japan, a term that captures the dual\ncharacter of youth and the economy is \"freeter\" (furiitaa) which comes from the\nword arubaito, meaning part-time work and derived from the German arbeit, and\nthe English \"free.\" In attending hip-hop club events, I found that most of the\nclubbers were college students, and a few high school students, but a large\nproportion of the rest referred to themselves as \"freeter.\" Although the clubbers\n\nIntroduction -- 24\ncould express some pride in being a freeter, after all, they were unconstrained by\nthe rigid tracking of large corporations, this self-confidence would evaporate\nwhen I asked what they really did. It was not uncommon for these fans to\nhesitate, or look sheepish as they explained their no future jobs as waitresses,\nconvenience store clerks, sewer workers, construction workers, welcome girls at\ndepartment stores, and so on. It was clear that freeter, with its emphasis on\nfreedom was attractive for diverting attention from their otherwise dull and,\nfrom the youths' point of view, subservient jobs.\nJapanese youth may tend to be dissatisfied with their labor positions, but\nthey are also represented as world-class consumers, among the few who can\nrival America's youth in their choosiness. Consider this excerpt from a New\nYork Times article about a global beverage company's marketing efforts in Japan,\nbecause it captures one image of the burgeoning, new era, transnational\nconsumer.\nAbove all, the world's consumers are getting choosier. It is truer in richer\nnations than in poor ones, but almost everywhere consumers are\nbecoming more demanding. We want more options. We want bottled\nwater. We want health drinks. We want a brand-new thing we have\nnever seen before, and three months later we want another one. We want\nendless choices, in dozens of categories, and it wouldn't hurt if you let us\nbuy drinks with our phones. In short, we are all becoming Japanese\nteenagers. (Stevenson 2002)\nThis desire for the \"brand new thing\" is fueled, of course, by various \"lifestyle\nindustries\" and their constant drive for new markets and styles, but it is\ninteresting that Japanese ethnicity is increasingly defined by this consumer\n\nIntroduction -- 25\nsensitivity. Each issue of Wired magazine even has a \"Japanese schoolgirl watch\"\npage, where they report on the latest fad from these J-Girls (e.g., multiple cell\nphone straps as fashion accessory, August 2002). This characterization of Japan\nalso highlights the tension between hip-hop as consumer item and hip-hop as\ncultural production that plays itself out in a variety of ways. The question this\nraises, however, is how ideas of youth are incorporated into these visions of\ncultural capitalism. That is, as consumerism, contra mass production, is\nincreasingly viewed as the linchpin to the global economy, does this not change\nthe dynamic of evaluating \"fashion\" and \"leisure\" as central, while moving\nquestions of production to the secondary status of \"responding to demand\"?\nJapanese teens, therefore, provide a test case for evaluating these dual changes in\nthe post-industrial economy, namely, an increasingly flexible labor force.\nFredric Jameson is one of the leading theorists in thinking about the\nintersection of culture and capitalism. He asks whether \"in our time, the\nrelationship between culture and economics has fundamentally altered. At any\nrate it does seem to me that fresh cultural production and innovation - and this\nmeans in the area of mass-consumed culture - are the crucial index of the\ncentrality of a given area and not its wealth or productive power\" (Jameson 1999:\n67). This idea of \"fresh cultural production,\" which he clarifies as \"\"new and\noriginal, better still, new forms\" (personal communication), is useful for drawing\nattention to the production of culture, but it introduces another conundrum:\nFresh in what way? And for whom? For record companies, \"fresh\" means\nreaching a wide market, perhaps even creating a new genre of music. A few\nmillion selling hits can do a lot to shift the orientation of large record companies\neager to catch the wave of the next rising fad. And \"fresh\" for fans of hip-hop in\n\nIntroduction -- 26\nthe U.S., as I'm often told by people who ask questions at my talks, seems to\nrequire that the Japanese be more explicitly Japanese, perhaps incorporating\ntraditional instrumentation. But \"fresh\" for the artists and fans in Japan means a\nwide variety of things - catchy lyrics, socially-pointed topics, a distinctive flow\nand phat beats - which may or may not be the same things that attract Japanese\nrecord company executives or foreign listeners.\nJameson uses the example of Japanese companies buying U.S.\nentertainment companies in the 1990s, when Matsushita bought MCA and Sony\nbought Columbia Pictures. This \"invasion\" of Hollywood was, at the time, seen\nas a test case for evaluating the creativity of American and Japanese companies.\nFor several years, Sony's failure to produce a big hit in Hollywood suggested\nthat \"even despite ownership itself and private property, the Japanese were\nunable to master the essentially cultural productivity required to secure the\nglobalization process for any given competitor\" (Jameson 1999: 67). But in 2002,\nSony's Columbia Pictures produced the number one film of the year in box office\nreceipts: Spiderman. The film's commercial success, but dubious cinematic value\n(in my humble opinion), seems to me to force a reconsideration of this debate.\nAlthough we may agree that \"fresh cultural production\" is a key measure of a\nnation's centrality, we should be cautious in equating commercial success with\nfreshness. The role of record companies is important, in this regard, but as we\nwill see in Chapter 3, although these entertainment companies exert tremendous\ncontrol in terms of gatekeeping, that is, deciding which artists and which songs\nwill get support, nevertheless the creative content of the music itself is most often\ngenerated by the artists themselves. Understanding this process requires looking\nat the Japanese rap world from a variety of perspectives, as the different chapters\n\nIntroduction -- 27\nof the book will attempt to do. The key question is, how do we evaluate the\ncommercialization of hip-hop culture? Or, to put it another way, how do we\nuntangle the pull of commercialization and the push of cultural creativity in the\nmaking of products that generate a meaningful difference?\nOne dimension of debate, for example, concerns whether producers or\nconsumers are the central agents in constructing the meaning of mass culture\ntexts. Elizabeth Traube (1996) draws attention to some shortcomings of work that\nfocuses on either the production or the consumption end of popular culture.\nYet both productionist and consumptionist approaches to mass-produced\npopular culture have tended to represent its ideological influence in terms\nof homogenization, differing only in their assessments of how successful\nthe culture industries are in shaping social consciousness. Where the\nolder, production-centered approach emphasized the ideological\neffectivity of mass culture, reception studies found active \"resistant\"\naudiences who use mass-cultural forms to define themselves against\ndominant norms and values. Neither view adequately accounts for the\noperation of culture industries. On the one hand, the receptionist\nassumption that asserted cultural differences have oppositional political\nvalue needs to be reconsidered in light of the culture industries'\nheightened interest in marketing diverse forms of distinction . . . . On the\nother hand, industrial cultural production has never been a seamless\nprocess, and it can be argued that under the prevailing structural\nconditions, contestation and contradiction are becoming part of the\nroutine. (Traube 1996: xiv)\n\nIntroduction -- 28\nThis move in cultural studies to develop more nuanced understandings of both\nproduction and reception leads us to consider different national settings for\nunderstanding this process. While the commodification of culture on the part of\nthe entertainment industries is turned around into the culturalization of\ncommodities by consumers, what is still missing from our analysis a deeper\nunderstanding of the ways the consumers and the producers condition each\nother. In the hip-hop world, this includes a deeper investigation the processes\ninvolved in the commodification of culture, as digital technology, copyright\nlaws, artistic practices of sampling and remixing, increasingly draw into question\ntraditional media business practices. But it also means that fans have a\nsomewhat different array of resources to draw upon in giving meaning to the\nmusic, particularly in the densely packed lyrics and the intertextuality of the\nmusic as it arises through sampling and remixing. The key question regarding\ncommodification in Japanese hip-hop is this: How can we grasp the business\npractices, the performances turned into commodities and the experiential\npleasures that together generate the emergent character of Japanese hip-hop?\nRather than seeking some underground space that is removed from money\nchanging hands, we must examine the ways that commodification tells only part\nof the story. It is this that brings us to the cultural politics of hip-hop in Japan as\na way of refocusing our efforts in a way that situates the value of the music in the\nsettings where the music makes a difference.\nPOLITICS\n\"It's true, we lost the war / But don't dis us on scene today\"\n-- Zeebra (1999)\n\nIntroduction -- 29\nThe axes of global versus local, and of economics versus culture, lead us to\nevaluating Japanese hip-hop in terms of a more diverse array of cultural politics.\nThere is no single \"Japanese\" approach to hip-hop, and instead we find a wide\nrange of styles, some more pointedly political, others aimed at the polymorphous\npleasures of music in general. The \"freshness\" of the Japanese styles should not\nbe evaluated simply on the basis of whether they are sufficiently Japanese, which\nwould require us to determine what exactly might be \"Japanese\" beyond using\nthe language: using traditional instruments, or talking about samurai, geisha\nand sushi? In terms of commercialism, it also makes no sense to fetishize the\n\"underground\" sound as opposed to major releases, in other words, to start with\nwhat is often taken to be more \"real\" versus more \"commercial\" because, as we\nwill see, the production of both types of music may differ little, and the character\nof the songs themselves do not map neatly into one or the other category. What\nthis suggests is that while we consider the Japaneseness of the music, and the\nways in which the music and the identities are commodified, we want to work\noutwards to clarify the ways the music brings to life an array of political\nsubjectivities. The two examples I use in this section illustrate that hip-hop in\nJapan leads neither to blind adoration of things American, nor a simple\nfetishization of things Japanese. Again, it is the shifting character of the middle\nground, recirculating through the world of hip-hop that can help us understand\nthe significance of the broad ranging networks of global popular culture.\nOne of the assumptions worth examining about American popular culture\noverseas is the degree to which it makes people \"want to be like us.\" As King\nGiddra rapped about the dangers of believing in a fantasy of the life of the\ncelebrity, \"just to be able to sing in front of people,\" so too does the image of a\n\nIntroduction -- 30\nhip-hop world on MTV contain a certain kind of appeal. But this appeal, which\nthe rappers describe as \"a dope feeling from the streets,\" may not entail a love of\nall things American. A recent film by Kitano Takeshi called \"Brother\" plays on\nthe idea of the kinship between Asians and African-Americans, with Kitano's\nstarring role as a Japanese mobster (yakuza) exiled from his organization, who\ngoes to see his brother living in L.A. with an African-American played by Omar\nEpps. The story follows Takeshi, his brother and Epps who violently take over\nthe L.A. drug dealing business, gunning down everyone and anyone who gets in\nthe way. The mobster himself speaks almost no English, and this is one of the\nfilm's conceits as Takeshi bursts into ultra-violence instead of speaking. Sadly,\nperhaps the true global language is not English, but violence. The three\nentrepreneurs kill their way up the ladder, gunning down all \"the Mexicans\"\nwho formerly ran the area's drug trade. In one of the movie's pivotal scenes,\nTakeshi and his brother meet with the higher ups, ostensibly to make a deal to\ntake over the Mexicans' place. The scene is sampled (and slightly edited) in a\nsong by Zeebra that is inspired by the film. The sampled scene opens with one of\nthe mobster's challenging Takeshi and his brother for the recent killings.\nAmerican Mobster 1: \"So you think you can get away with what you\ndid?\"\nMob Boss: \"Just relax, okay? Let's discuss this like gentlemen. [Speaking\nto Takeshi and his brother] From now on, you're going to be in charge,\njust as it always was.\"\n[In the film, Takeshi's brother leaves the room, and the mobsters speak in front of\nTakeshi, assuming he understands no English.]\n\nIntroduction -- 31\nMobster 1, challenging the boss: \"You telling them you're going to let\nthem have the territory? Now why would you do that for these fucking\nJaps.\"\nTakeshi sits smiling as if oblivious. Takeshi's brother returns to the room, and\nsitting down, he and Takeshi pull out guns they have previously hidden under\nthe table, and they proceed to gun down all the mobsters. Looking over the\ncarnage, Takeshi gets the last word, \"I can understand 'fucking Jap,' asshole.\"3\nThis story of a Japanese mobster going to L.A. and winning the battle there with\nlots of gun play resonates with a postwar history of relationship between\nAmerica and Japan, such that Japan's expected role is one of being a grateful for\nall the help America has provided. But by the late 1980s, those days seemed\nnumbered, with right-wing politician Ishihara Shintaro and the head of Sony,\nMorita Akio, penning the diatribe The Japan that Can Say No (Ishihara 1991).\nZeebra, in his song inspired by the film Brother makes a similar kind of assertion:\ntashika ni maketa ze, senso jya\nit's true we lost the war\nda kedo DISrarenee, ima no genjo wa\nbut don't dis us now\norera tafu de, haado na kokusaiha\nwe are tough, hard internationalists\nmasa ni erabinukareta toppu faitaa\nthe top fighters who made it through\n-- \"Neva Enuff\"(Zeebra featuring Aktion) 1999\nIt is important to recognize that Zeebra is rapping from the perspective of the\nJapanese mobster, and this is not necessarily Zeebra's own opinion, but\nnevertheless it is striking to see the ways that \"American\" popular culture can be\nIn the film, bakayaro is translated as \"asshole,\" though in Japanese, the word is more literally\ntranslated as \"stupid idiot.\"\n\nIntroduction -- 32\nused to undermine the attractiveness of Americanness. Later in the song, fellow\nrapper Aktion laughs, \"I can't even understand your English - ha ha!\"\nThe political place of American cultural forms in Japan goes through\nwaves of transformations. The historian Carol Gluck points out that twentieth\ncentury Japan witnessed two concentrated phases of Americanization, one in the\n1920s and another in the decade following WWII. In her words,\nThe influence of the United States took diverse forms in the 1920s,\nincluding Fordism and Taylorism in industry, flappers, jazz, and\nHollywood movies in popular culture, and the rationalization of\nhousehold management and creation of a new women's culture. Many in\nthe urban middle classes welcomed American influence as speedy and\nefficient, others as empowering and emancipatory. But in the face of their\nenthusiasm for American ways, most of the public talk focused instead on\nthe negative impact of a culture its critics regarded as superficial,\nmaterialistic, and a threat national values and social order alike. (Gluck\n1997: 578-79)\nBy the 1930s this Americanization was being replaced by a rising tide of nativist\nideology, backed up by violence and coercion, both at home and abroad. In the\nimmediate postwar period, Japan embraced America again as a model of wealth\nand democracy that would bring Japan out of the \"dark valley\" of war (Dower\n1999). But this love affair with things American began to take on the character of\na love-hate relationship, with the opposite poles moving further apart. In the\nentertainment world, the desire for Western music was gradually replaced by\nhomegrown artists, and from 1968 onwards, sales of Japanese artists steadily\noutpaced those of Western musicians. As the 1980s and 1990s progressed, a\n\nIntroduction -- 33\nwidening array of media choices, and a more cosmopolitan perspective seems to\nhave introduced a greater distance between American and Japanese people, one\nthat is being sorely tested at the time of writing by opposition to American forces\nin Okinawa and questioning of the Bush administration's policy towards North\nKorea. In this setting, hip-hop can even be used to question the military\ndominance, as K Dub Shine raps about the international trade in weapons \"made\nin goddamn USA\" (meedo in fuzaketa U.S.A.) in a song called \"Organized Crime.\"\nIt is widely argued that postmodernism and globalization are bringing about a\nchange in the relationship between societies of the world, and this new fluidity,\nand emergent forms of political organization and transnational citizenship are\nillustrated in a variety of ways through Japanese hip-hop.\nOne might think that with this anti-Americanism, there would be a\nparallel emphasis on the beauty and originality of Japanese culture, but here too,\nthe lessons are mixed. Take the case of the rapper Kohei Japan. On the surface,\nhe appropriates cliche aspects of Japanese culture, actively parodying both\nJapaneseness and hip-hop. On the cover of recent CD, rapper Kohei Japan is\nshown as woodblock print, giving the \"funk sign.\" The funk sign on his kimono\nas well.\n\nIntroduction -- 34\nFigure 1: Creative Localization? Kohei Japan (2000) CD jacket\nKohei is the younger brother of a more established rapper. They both grew up in\nYokohama, and Kohei lived with his parents until his late 20s. While he has been\npursuing a music career with a rap group named Mellow Yellow, he has been\nworking as a chef in Yokohama. An excerpt from a song by Kohei from his solo\ndebut album \"The Adventures of Kohei Japan\" (2000, File Records) exemplifies\none approach of Japanese rappers in playful lyrics that contrast Japan with the\nWest:\nalways all-natural completely Yoga\nnot bread, but rice; not ramen, but soba\nnot meat, but fish not cooked, but raw\nnot flowers, but dango my cap is from Kangol\n\nIntroduction -- 35\nwearing a hunting cap, it's my time\nK-O-H-E-I, the Japonica\nThese lyrics show how \"global\" hip-hop is used to emphasize a kind of Japanese\nnational identity. He likes it raw, not cooked; soba (Japanese noodles) not ramen\n(Chinese noodles); and so on. Here again we can see that \"global\" and \"local\"\nare not best viewed as dichotomies, but rather that they are mutually implicated\nin producing each other. But this approach is not, in fact, the mirror image of\ndissing the U.S. by praising Japan, because an important facet of Kohei's\napproach is the use of parody, which offers a contrast to the direct, in-your-face\nstyle of Zeebra.4 Parody, in this example, also illustrates the drawback of\ninterpreting this kind of song as a reassertion of the local. Kohei is clearly\ndrawing on images of essential Japaneseness, the food preferences, the kimono\nhe wears in the woodblock print cover of his CD, even his decision to add\n\"Japan\" to his name. As an anthropologist, my initial reaction was to see this as\nan illustration of the ways that a foreign style, hip-hop, can be used to reinforce\ntraditional elements of Japanese culture, and, at a superficial level this is the case.\nKohei is partly saying that being Japanese is cool. But if we consider the\nperspective of his audience, what becomes clear is that he is not so much\nrebutting assertions of an emerging homogenized world culture, so much as a\ntongue-in-cheek style to contrast with the sincere, tough guy assertiveness of\nZeebra's style. Here we begin to see the usefulness of situating cultural texts in\nthe context of the audience that is interpreting the music. A fan of Kohei's said\nThanks go to Bret De Bary for suggesting this connection.\n\nIntroduction -- 36\nshe like his style because he was \"fun\" and, unlike the more hard core style of\nZeebra, he is not just putting on a tough stance (kakko tsukete).\nPlacing the song in the context of his audience gives us a further insight into his\nuse of the term \"hungry,\" which has an intriguing double meaning. Kohei is\nhungry for certain things (a desire to consume), but \"hungry\" is also a common\nway of describing musicians who really want to make it in the music world. This\nis a hunger to be recognized, to be a successful artist, and to become a\n\"phenomenon\" (gensho) among a large group of fans. One of the things I want to\nsuggest is that power of popular culture comes in part from the two-sidedness of\nthis hunger: to consume selectively, and to produce something noteworthy.\nThese examples of Zeebra and Kohei Japan, therefore, begin to give us a sense of\nthe dynamics of the cultural politics of Japanese hip-hop.\nThis suggests that analyzing culture depends on identifying not the\npatterns that characterize all Japanese, but rather the lines of debate that produce\nshifting notions of what it means to be Japanese. Where as nihonjinron (theory of\nJapanese people) encourages a focus on the foreign/domestic dichotomy,\nJapanese hip-hop forces us to develop a more nuanced analysis of the dynamics\nproducing contemporary Japan emerges. Along these lines, we may gain a\ndeeper appreciation of the relationship between culture and place by seeing how\nglobal, national, and local provide certain axes of identity. This brings us to a\nview of transnationalism is emerging in specific interconnected spaces, rather\nthan being characterized as \"forces\" from outside affecting \"local places\" (Tsing\n2000).\nFrom its inception, cultural studies has been concerned with the activities\nof marginalized groups, often in an effort to map the ways that studying\n\nIntroduction -- 37\nsubaltern groups can expose the injustices of the mainstream, hegemonic\ncultures. An important strategy in cultural studies is showing the ways that\nmarginal groups can deny authority to the authorities. But this focus on\nresistance becomes complicated by the fact that resistances can often lead to\ndifferent kinds of complicity. Just as \"local hip-hop\" helps build interest in\nforeign forms, so too can efforts of communities to become \"self-sufficient\" lead\nto an increasing integration into dependence on the global economy. This is not\nto say that every progressive aim is hopeless, but rather that we need to develop\nmore subtle ways of understanding cultural politics.\nMy aim is to work towards developing a model of engagement that can\nattend to the cross-cutting dimensions of interaction that produce shifting modes\nof complicity and resistance, and to develop appropriate ways of characterizing\nthis new world disorder. Lawrence Grossberg (1996: 88) argues that cultural\nstudies needs to move beyond models of oppression, \"both the 'colonial model'\nof oppressor and oppressed, and the 'transgression model' of oppression and\nresistance.\" Instead, he argues, we need to move the concept of identity towards\n\"a model of articulation as 'transformative practice,' as a singular becoming of a\ncommunity.\" This notion of \"transformative practice\" is important because it\ndraws attention to the ways that identity is not something merely inherited in\none's genes nor something fully defined by elites, but rather something that\nemerges over time through day-to-day activities, which entail engagement with a\nvariety of moral projects. This view suggests that identity is shifting and\ncontextual, built on the past, but actively constructed with a vision towards the\nfuture. Thus, we might conceive of identity in ways analogous to freestyle\nsessions which unfold according to certain genre conventions, but which also\n\nIntroduction -- 38\ndepend for their success on unexpected innovation that, over time, can become\ntransformative. Moreover, it is the participation in the cipher, as freestyle\nsessions are also called, that, for a brief period at least, characterizes this notion\nof a \"singular becoming of a community.\"\nBut how do we proceed? How can we capture the global/local dynamics,\nattend to the processes of commodification, and work outwards from hip-hop in\nJapan to evaluate the cultural politics of contemporary Japan that make a\ndifference?\nGENBA POWER\nEthnography and Fieldwork on Global Popular Culture\nInterestingly, the question of how to do this is similar to the problem I\nfaced in beginning to study Japanese hip-hop. As a Ph.D. candidate in cultural\nanthropology, I set out to find an appropriate fieldwork site where I could\nengage in participant-observation, tracking the lifeways and perspectives of the\nnatives I had chosen to study, namely, the B-Boys and B-Girls (hip-hop\nenthusiasts) of Tokyo. In the fall of 1995 I began a year and a half of intensive\nfieldwork in Tokyo. I wanted to understand the various aspects of Japanese hip-\nhop, but the number of potential sites was daunting. There were places where\nthe music was produced: record companies, recording studios, home studios,\nand even on trains with handheld synthesizers. There were places where the\nmusic was promoted: music magazines, fashion magazines, TV and radio\nshows, nightclubs, and record stores. There was the interaction between\nmusicians and fans at live shows, or in mediated form on cassettes, CDs and 12\"\nLPs. To complicate things further, rap music is part of the larger category of\n\nIntroduction -- 39\n\"hip-hop,\" which also includes breakdance, DJ, graffiti, as well as fashion. One of\nthe tenets of anthropological fieldwork is that you cannot understand a people\nwithout being there, but in the case of a music genre, where is \"there\"?\nAs I began interviewing rappers, magazine writers, and record company\npeople, I found a recurring theme that provided a partial answer. Everyone\nagreed that you cannot understand Japanese rap music without going regularly\nto the clubs. Clubs were called the \"actual site\" (genba) of the Japanese rap\nscene. It was there that rappers performed, DJs learned which songs elicit\nexcitement in the crowd, and breakdancers practiced and competed for attention.\nClubbing is an odd combination of excitement and lull, focused attention on the\nstage and mobile circulation among the crowd. I was also surprised to learn\nhow much networking and business planning goes on in the clubs. Magazine\nwriters covered club events, and often conducted interviews before or after the\nshows. Going to the clubs also revealed how, over time, the music and the social\nnetworks evolved together, with different \"families\" of Japanese rap groups\nperforming together for years, and developing a distinctive style, as well as a\ncohort of artists and fans. In sum, these all-night clubs offered an entry point for\ntrying grasp the experiential pleasures of the participants within a variety of\nbusiness practices.\nLive shows are central for understanding the paths that Japanese hip-hop\nhas taken, and they also are the events around which many musicians' lives\nrevolve, at least, the musical part of their lives. At the same time, it was clear\nthat artists, magazines, and, of course record companies, also measured\ndevelopments in terms of CD releases. After attending various artists events for\nseveral months, and as they became aware of my interests, I got the chance to\n\nIntroduction -- 40\nobserve recording sessions. Recording studios offered a different but also\nrevealing genba of musical, cultural, and business interactions. This is the\nmaterial objectification and commodification of performance. Moreover, the\nmaking of recordings, because it is in the transformation of the performances into\nrecords and CDs that is, for now at least, the path to widespread success, both in\nterms of financial rewards and public recognition. Therefore, I use the recording\nstudio as a second \"actual site\" for understanding the character of hip-hop in\nJapan.\nThis notion of the genba (pronounced with a hard \"g\" as in given) suggests\nthat the power of popular culture can be understood to some degree by looking\nat the intersecting relationships in the nightclubs and recording studios. Such an\napproach is part of a broader move within anthropology to move away from\nseeing fieldwork as situated in bounded, geographical locales. Akhil Gupta and\nJames Ferguson (1997) argue that it is important to see anthropology's distinctive\ntrademark not as a commitment to \"the local\" (as in the people of some local\ncommunity) but rather to emphasize anthropology's \"attentiveness to\nepistemological and political issues of location\" (p. 39). In their words,\n\"Ethnography's great strength has always been the explicit and well-developed\nsense of location, of being set here-and-not-elsewhere. This strength becomes a\nliability when notions of 'here' and 'elsewhere' are assumed to be features of\ngeography, rather than sites constructed in fields of unequal power relations\" (p.\n35). To this end, Gupta and Ferguson stress the importance of foregrounding\nquestions of \"location, intervention, and the construction of situated\nknowledges\" and to focus on \"shifting locations\" rather than \"bounded fields\"\n(Gupta and Ferguson 1997: 5, 39). It is this approach which to me offers a way of\n\nIntroduction -- 41\nreconsidering cultural studies an era in which area studies is being reshaped by\ntransnational connections.\nBy focusing on nightclubs and recording studios as genba, or actual sites,\nwe may be able to develop ways of moving beyond the clash between\nconsumptionist and productionist perspectives to a more careful reading of the\ndifferent kinds of power that actors have. As I discuss more fully in Chapter 3, I\nwould propose thinking about power in the culture industry of music in terms of\nfour groups: artist-entrepreneurs, record companies, media outlets (retail and\npublications), and fans (or, consumers and audience). Each of these actors has a\ndifferent kind of power, yet the power of each depends in part on the power of\nthe others, not unlike a socially diffuse game of rock-paper-scissors. One's\npower depends on one's location, the reactions of the other participants, and the\nbreadth of circulation that cultural products attain. What's more, a notion of\nlocation helps us grasp the ways that global and local, as commercial and\ncultural, are intertwined. Moreover, a growing number of people are mapping\ndifferent approaches to an \"ethical cosmopolitanism\" which may offer some\npossibilities for new kinds of cultural politics of the future (Ginsburg, et al.\n2002b; Tomlinson 1999). .\nWhat this book does and doesn't do\nThe goal of this book then is to develop an understanding of the nuanced\ncultural politics of Japanese hip-hop. We will consider the ways ideas of\nglobality intersect with ideas of nation, region and locality, but what we find is\nthat a singular \"Japanese\" understanding of hip-hop is impossible to define.\nWhat does emerge, however, is a quite distinctive range of debates, about the\n\nIntroduction -- 42\nrole of economics in cultural life, about the power of expressions, and about the\nproblems facing Japanese society and the world at large. Each chapter discusses\na different aspect of these cultural politics, including race, language, history, the\nclub scene, the recording industry, digital technology and copyright in recording\nstudios, and the social contexts for rap fandom. [This section will be expanded to\ninclude somewhat more detailed descriptions for each chapter.] In sum, this\nbooks aims to give a broad overview of the cultural politics that enliven the\nJapanese hip-hop scene, and to use this as a case study for rethinking today's key\nquestions for cultural studies.\nMy research methods are based on extended fieldwork among the\nmusicians and fans, focused primarily on nightclubs and recording studios in\nTokyo. After my first research trip to Japan during the summer of 1994, I began\nextended fieldwork between September 1995 and February 1997. I have made\nbrief return trips almost every year since then, most recently in January 2003. I\nhave attended more than 120 club events, mostly in Tokyo, though some in\noutlying suburbs. I have also witnessed over 50 recording sessions, from small\nhome studios to multimillion dollar studios. I interviewed numerous musicians,\nfans, event organizers, and club owners at the club events, or arranged times to\nmeet at a more quiet location. I supplemented this fieldwork with interviews\nwith record company representatives, record store owners, and music magazine\nwriters. During my extended fieldwork, I also attended monthly editorial\nmeetings of Remix magazine, which covers a wide range of club music.\nI have chosen to focus on the musicians of Japanese hip-hop, with\nparticular emphasis on the rappers and the things they talk about in their songs.\nMy initial inspiration for studying Japanese hip-hop was hearing some of the\n\nIntroduction -- 43\nearly CDs by Rhymester and Scha Dara Parr, for example, which convinced me\nthat introducing American audiences to their view of Japan would be a worthy\ngoal in and of itself, and to a large extent this remains one of the goals of this\nbook. There could easily be books written about the breakdance scene, the\nturntablism scene and DJ competitions, and the graffiti art scenes. Although I\nwill talk some about each of these, my focus is on the music and particularly the\nwords of the MCs, because it is here that the intersection of ideas, media and\nculture come out most strongly for me.\nThat said, there are many other sides of Japanese hip-hop that will receive\nonly scant attention. I do not, for example, engage in a close comparison of the\nscenes in Japan and the U.S. This could be a very interesting project, but I believe\nthe most important first step for understanding Japanese hip-hop is to hear it in\nits own terms. Too often a Japanese group is likened to an American group, or\nthe scene is likened to some era (always in the past) in the U.S., and this tends to\nreinforce an ethnocentric reading of the Japanese scene as always a little less, and\na little behind, \"us.\" Although I have attended about a dozen shows of\nAmerican artists in Japan (EPMD, Snoop Dogg, Das EFX, and Nas, to name a\nfew), I also leave this side of the Japanese hip-hop world to a later study.\nIn short, I hope to introduce the readers to the world of Japanese hip-hop,\nwhile exploring its implications for understanding the emergent cultural\nformations of the present, their intersection with business practices, and their\npotential for a diverse range of politics. In many ways, I see the example of\nGaku-MC, described at the beginning of this chapter, trying to build up the\nenergy at Club Family, and then succeeding, as analogous to the ways the youth\nculture movements are produced through a collective excitement that, when they\n\nIntroduction -- 44\nwork, create something new, and potentially something greater than the sum of\nthe original parts. This may open us to rethinking the boundaries implicated in\ndividing diverse peoples, and for understanding the connections that are\nreconstituting today's world. It may also lead us closer to an as yet unfulfilled\npromise of globalization, namely, a richer dialogue based on mutual respect and\nsympathy among the peoples of the world.\n\nIntroduction -- 45\nREFERENCES\nAnderson, Benedict\n1991 Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origin and Spread of\nNationalism.
