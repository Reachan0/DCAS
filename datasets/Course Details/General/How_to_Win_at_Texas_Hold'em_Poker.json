This roughly translates to\n\"points\".\n\nThe total points awarded for a qualified tournament are exactly equal to the number of players in the\ntournament. So a 20-player tournament awards 20 points and a 50-player tournament awards 50\npoints. The points awarded are spread across the top third of participants, with a higher proportion\ngoing to higher placements in the finish order. (Rounding may occur to ensure that total points equal\ntotal players and top third of players is a whole number.)\n\niPad Air Wi-Fi 16GB, courtesy of Jane Street Capital\n$200 Amazon gift certificate, courtesy of Akuna Capital\n(9) subscriptions to poker training website Cardrunners, with\ndurations (in months) 6,4,3,2,2,1,1,1,1\n(2) one-hour private coaching sessions from Mike \"Timex\"\nMcDonald, and myself\n(2) ifidelity Groove Bluetooth Speakers, courtesy of Jane Street\nCapital\n(2) BOOMPODS headpods, courtesy of Jane Street Capital\n(2) $50 Amazon gift certificates, courtesy of Akuna Capital\n(10) $20 Amazon gift certificates, courtesy of Akuna Capital\n(will be given during class and office hours)\n\n6:00 PM - Daily 6-handed (2 hrs)\n7:00 PM - Daily Major (3 hrs)\n8:00 PM - Daily Turbo (2 hrs)\n9:00 PM - Daily Deepstack (3 hrs)\n10:00 PM - Daily Shortstack (2 hrs)\n11:00 PM - Daily Hyper-turbo (1 hr)\nLate registration for 1 hour\nCan multi-table\nCould change / have specials; talk to the\nLeague Manager\n\nAlthough this is a play money league for\nbeginners, we want to see people trying to\nlearn, playing their best poker.\nIf we see regular behavior that suggests\notherwise, we may kick you out of the league\n(and thus the class)\nEg.

If we lose,\nour net result from this decision is -8000. If we\nwin, we get our 8000 back, as well as the 21000\nin the pot, resulting a net of 21000.\nTherefore our win:lose ratio needs to be at least\n8000:21000 for calling to be +EV.\n\nAK, AQ, AJ, A8 8 combos each.

Need equity 1/3.56 ~ 28% to call\n\nHand reading is about using the\nopponent's past actions and your\nknowledge of their tendencies to\ntweak your probabilities on their hand\nHand reading is not about pegging\nyour opponent on a specific hand\nThe sunglasses and ear-plugs are\nmostly a marketing scheme\n\nYou can go very far with Level 2 reasoning, if\nyou can build reasonable models for your\nopponent's range and correctly compute the\nequities of hands.\nLevel 2 reasoning is best targeted towards\nindividual opponents with specific tendencies\nthat you are trying to take advantage of.\n\nYour opponent does not play according to a\nfixed static algorithm.\nThey are an intelligent entity who is also\nbuilding models for you, and adapting their\nstrategy to beat you!\n\nLevel 1: My hand vs. your hand\nLevel 2: My hand vs. your range of hands\n(\"Exploitative Play\")\nLevel 3: My range of hands vs. your range of\nhands (\"Optimal Play\")\n\nGiven my previous actions in this hand, I will\nend up in this spot with the range AJ-A7,\n\nI know my opponent's propensity is to bet 1/1.6\nof pot on the river, ie. in this situation they are\nrisking 8000 to win 13000 with their bluffs.\nI must call with a frequency such that their EV\nfrom bluffing is 0.\nMy call:fold ratio needs to be 1.6:1, ie. I must call\n1.6/2.6~61.5% of the time. AJ is definitely in the\ntop 61.5% of hands I can have, so I call.\n\nExploitative Play: \"Since my opponent just\nplayed Rock 3 times in a row, I think their\nchances from playing Rock a 4th time is\ndiminished. Therefore, I will play Scissors.\"\nOptimal Play: \"I will memorize a sequence of\nrandom bits and always play each of Rock,\nPaper, Scissors with probability 1/3.\"\n\nIn RPS, you don't.\nIn poker, there are enough opportunities to\nbe inconsistent (eg. call 65s but sometimes\nfold 76s in the same spot, eg. check-raise a\nstrictly inferior range than optimal), that the\ntheoretical \"optimal\" strategy will slowly\nextract money from even the best players.\n\nOptimal Play\n-Play R, P, S all with 33%\nprobability (memorize a sequence\nof random bits?)\n-You are indifferent to your\nopponent's move\n-Make money only when your\nopponent does something strictly\nsuboptimal\n-Good vs. opponents you respect\n-Need to train your mentality\nExploitive Play\n-Select between R, P, S by\nobserving patterns in your\nopponent's play\n-You are susceptible to being out-\nread by your opponent\n-Make a lot of money when you\nare winning the mind games; lose\na lot when you are losing them\n-Good vs. beginners\n-Intuitive\n\nAnyone can join the contest for $1\nThe tallest person who joined gets the entire\npot\n(also known as k-beauty game)\n\nPoker without blinds would be like the Who's\nTaller game.\nThe motivation of every hand starts with\nstealing the money that was forced into the\npot. Without the blinds, there is no game.\nYou would always fold KK pre-flop if there\nwere no blinds.\n\nYour stack size is always measured relative to\nthe blinds. Having $400 in front of you in a\ngame where the blinds are $1/$2 is, for our\npurposes, completely equivalent to having\n$4000 in front of you in a $10/$20 game.\nIn both situations above, we say that you\nhave \"200 bets\", or \"200 big blinds\", or\n\"200BB\".\n\nWhy is stack size important? It essentially\ntells you \"how much you're playing for\",\nrelative to the blinds.\n\nWhat we actually care about is effective stack\nsize, which takes into account the stack sizes\nof the people remaining in the pot as well.\n\nWe are only\nwagering up to\n12.5BB (the Big\nBlind's stack\nsize).\nSure, we could\nhave wagered\nour entire 21BB\nvs. UTG+1 or\nUTG+2, but\nthey have\nalready folded.\nScreenshsots of PokerStars (c) PokerStars.com.

Raise to\ngive yourself a chance of winning the blinds\nwithout seeing a flop.\n\nThis is definitely beginner mistake #1.\n\nThe minimum raise is to raise to 2BB. However,\nthis is a bit small. You give the blinds the odds\nto make a profitable call.\nOn the other hand, if you raise to an amount too\nlarge (say all-in), you are risking more than\nnecessary to make your steal.\nYou want to hit that \"sweet spot\" between the\nminimum raise size of 2BB and all-in.\nReasonable rule of thumb: raise to 2.25BB in\ntournaments.\n\nIf you have 12BB or less (and there are antes),\njust go all-in, instead of raising to 2.25BB.\nRecall: rationale for raising big is to prevent\nblinds (and others) from calling for cheap;\nrationale for raising small is to lose less if we get\nre-raised and have to fold.\nBut 12BB is little enough that you never really\nwant to fold after committing 2.25BB, so all the\nbenefits of raising small have disappeared\nChange rule to 10BB without antes\n\nBeing too scared to go all-in preflop is\ndefinitely beginner mistake #2.\n\nBeginners tend to make all decisions based\non their cards, ignoring what effective stack\nsize they would be wagering, and position.\nExperienced players are willing to raise the\nblinds with much weaker hands from good\npositions, and risk going all-in a lot more\nfrequently when their stack size is low. Their\ncards are almost the least important factor.\n\nAlmost all beginners make the mistake of\nplaying too many hands, especially from early\nposition.\n\nRemember, only the best out of 9 hands wins\nthe pot. When there's 9 hands, that hand will\nbe very good! Second best gets nothing. So\ndon't play a hand unless you think it can be\nthe best of 9 hands.\n\nLet's compare opening from the small blind to\nopening from the button.\nOpening from the small blind, you have to get\nthrough one fewer person\nYou also have to wager less to raise, since half a\nbet has automatically been put in already.\nHowever, you are out of position.\nAll in all, these factors balance out and you can\nopen the same range from the small blind as you\nwould from the button.\nThe fact that you are out of position hurts less\nand less as stacks get shallower.\n\nWhen the effective stack size is closer to the\nminimum needed to be going all-in, your all-\nin range should be similar to the opening\nranges I suggested\n\nWhen the effective stack size is much smaller\n(eg. 5BB), your all-in range can be a bit\nbigger, but not a lot bigger\n\nA straight up pot odds calculation says\n*Getting 23 to 20 = 1.15 to 1 odds\n*Thus need 1/2.15 ~ 46.5%\n\nBut 2 players behind who can wake up with\nmonster hands, so in reality we need a bit\nmore\n\nPot odds calculation:\n*Getting 43 to 18 = 2.39 to 1 odds\n*Thus need 1/3.39 ~ 29.5%\n\nThere are no more players behind, so we\nneed only this equity to call\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu\n15.S50 How to Win at Texas Hold'em\nIAP 2016\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: https://ocw.mit.edu/terms."
