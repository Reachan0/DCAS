      "content": "6.730 PHYSICS FOR SOLID STATE APPLICATIONS\nDepartment of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\n\"REAL\" SEMICONDUCTOR PROJECT\n\nPart III: Electronic Band Structure (DUE IN CLASS, DAY 38)\nIn this part of the project, you will be developing an LCAO picture for the valence and conduction bands of\nyour semiconductor. As in the phonon part of the project, you will first develop a general form for the\nsolution. You will then apply that form to your material, compare your calculated results with results\nreported in the literature, and use your results to evaluate physically interesting material properties.\nA. Background Questions - Before developing the Hamiltonian matrix, answer the following general\nquestions about the LCAO method:\n1. For our LCAO model we construct our trial wave function typically using only the outermost (highest\nprincipal quantum number) orbitals (atomic wave functions). In other words, in a system with b atoms\nin the basis and n outermost orbitals per atom, the total number of orbitals in the LCAO wave function\nis nb. How many atomic orbitals will you have for your material? Why?\n2. Conceivably one could also construct the LCAO wave function out of core orbitals as well as valence\norbitals. If you did so, how many atomic wave functions would you have to use for your material?\nHow large would your Hamiltonian matrix be in this case? How do you expect your results would\ndiffer from those you would get with just valence orbitals? What if we used higher (totally unoccupied)\norbitals, too? How many orbitals per atom would we have to use to get an \"exact\" band structure?\nWhy?\nB. Construction of Hamiltonian Matrix\n1. What are the atomic configurations of the two atoms in your material? Which orbitals do you expect to\nplay a significant role in bonding?\n2. Draw all the atoms in the basis and all their nearest neighbors with appropriate orbitals on each atom.\nLabel the orbitals according to their lattice vector, basis vector, orbital type, and the type atom they are\nassociated with (cation or anion). For example, the s orbital on the cation at lattice vector R, basis\nvector τ would be labeled |φsc(R+τ)>\n3. Show that one can approximate all the nearest neighbor interactions with one of the following (to\nwithin a sign). Pictorial arguments (with accompanying explanation) are acceptable.\nEss=<φsc(0)|H|φsa(a/4,a/4,a/4)>\nEsp=<φsc(0)|H|φpxa(a/4,a/4,a/4)>\nExx=<φpxc(0)|H|φpxa(a/4,a/4,a/4)>\nExy=<φpxc(0)|H|φpya(a/4,a/4,a/4)>\nIs this approximation reasonable? Comment on the validity of\n<φsc(0)|H|φpxa(a/4,a/4,a/4)> = <φsa(0)|H|φpxc(a/4,a/4,a/4)>\nGiven this approximation, can we write\n<φsc(0)|H|φsc(0)> = <φsa(a/4,a/4,a/4)|H|φsa(a/4,a/4,a/4)> ?\nCalculate values for Ess, Esp, Exx, and Exy in terms of Vssσ, Vspσ, etc.\n\n4. Write your trial wave function as a linear combination of these extended orbitals. Be explicit about\nyour choice of phase factors.\n5. Find the Hamiltonian matrix for the nearest neighbor approximation. Your answer should contain only\nEss, Esp, Exx, Exy, the s and p energies of the anion and cation (Esa, Esc, Epa, and Epc) and phase factors.\nNOTE: You will be able to find this matrix in the literature. However, several of the sources\n(including Harrison, 1980 and Slater and Koster, 1954) have minor errors in their matrices or matrix\nelements, so check your answer carefully.\nC. Band Calculations\n1. Look up a \"real\" energy band diagram for your material. Include a copy in your report.\n2. Write a matlab program to plot the free-electron band structure for your material along the same\ndirections as used in the energy band you found in the literature [Note: neglecting factors of π/a, the\nsymmetry points are Γ =(0,0,0); X=(1,0,0); L = (1/2, 1/2, 1/2); K=(3/4, 3/4, 0); and W=(1, 1/2, 0)].\nIndicate the degeneracies of the different bands. Where is the Fermi level located? How does the free\nelectron band structure compare to the real band structure?\n3. Algebraically diagonalize the Hamiltonian matrix at the Γ point. What are the different energies and\neigenvectors, and what do they correspond to physically? Using Harrison's Solid State Table (attached)\nfind numerical values for Esa, Esc, Epa, Epc, Ess, Esp, Exx, and Exy. Compare your calculated energies at\nthe Γ point with values from the literature.\n4. Write a matlab program to plot the LCAO energy bands along the same directions as above, along with\nthe approximate location of the Fermi level. How do your results compare (qualitatively) with the band\nstructure you found in the literature? If you wish, optimize the matrix elements for your material.\n5. Where are the valence band maximum and the conduction band minimum located? What is the energy\ngap? Is your material direct or indirect?\nD. Effective Masses, Constant Energy Surfaces, Density of States\n1. Plot constant energy contours near the valence and conduction band edges for \"appropriate\" planes.\nFor example, if your minimum is at kmin along Γ-X, you should probably plot an energy contour for the\nkx-ky plane, and for the plane parallel to ky-kz that contains kmin. For a minimum along Γ-L, the plane\ncontaining the Γ-L direction and the plane perpendicular to that direction would make sense.\n2. Solve for the energy at a number of k points near the valence and conduction band edges. Fit these\npoints using a quadratic polynomial (be sure to think about your results from D1 when you do this).\nUse your results to find the effective masses for both the valence bands and the conduction band. How\ndo your results compare with results from the literature? How would you improve your results?\n3. Plot the total density of states (histogram method, include all bands) versus energy. Use your calculated\neffective masses to determine an approximate expression for the density of states near the valence and\nconduction band edges. How does this calculation compare with the total density of states?\n4. Using your total density of states, calculate the electronic specific heat of your material as a function of\ntemperature. Compare this with your calculations for the phonons, and comment.\n5. Use the band structure you found in the literature to discuss the characteristics of your material. What\nelectronic/optical applications would your material be good/bad for? Why?"

      "content": "6.730\n\"Real\" Semiconductor Project\nGaAs\n\nPart 1\n\nJanice Lee\nJuan Montoya\nBhuwan Singh\nCorina Tanasa\n\nFriday, March 09, 2001\n\n1. What is the crystal structure?\n\nThe crystal is a cubic sphalerite or zincblende structure, which consists of a face centered\ncubic lattice and a basis. The conventional basis consists of one GaAs molecule at the\norigin of the lattice. The basis is defined by a vector from one atom of the molecule at\n(0,0,0) to the other atom at (1⁄4, 1⁄4, 1⁄4). The crystal can also be viewed as two FCC\nlattices, one of Ga and the other of As, offset by the basis vector. [1] The crystal\nstructure is shown below in Fig. 1. Gallium atoms are shown in black and arsenic atoms\nare shown in red. There are 14 gallium atoms shown, but only 4 arsenic atoms.\nHowever, given that 8 cells share each corner atom and 2 cells share each face atom, it is\nseen that there are actually 4 arsenic and 4 gallium atoms per cubic unit cell, i.e. 4 basis\nmolecules per cell.\n\nFigure 1. FCC cubic unit cell of GaAs\n\n1. What is the lattice constant?\n\nAt T=300 K, the lattice constant, i.e. the length along any side of the cube, is A=5.6325A\n[1].\n\n2. What is the basis?\n\nAs stated earlier, the basis consists of one Ga atom and one As atom. The basis vector\nfor GaAs is\n\n(\n)z\ny\nx\nA\nb\nˆ\nˆ\nˆ\n+\n+\n=\nr\n\n(1)\nwhere xˆ , yˆ , zˆ are the cartesian unit vectors [2]. Fig. 2 shows the cubic unit cell again\nand a magnified view of the Ga-As basis.\n\nFigure 2. GaAs lattice with a magnified view of the basis\n\n3. What are the primitive lattice vectors?\n\nSince the lattice is face-centered cubic, the primitive lattice vectors are those of an fcc\nlattice. They are:\n)ˆ\nˆ\n(\ny\nx\nA\na\n+\n=\nr\n\n(2)\n)ˆ\nˆ\n(\nz\ny\nA\na\n+\n=\nr\n\n(3)\n)ˆ\nˆ\n(\nx\nz\nA\na\n+\n=\nr\n\n(4)\nThe angle between any two primitive lattice vectors is\no\n60 .\n1ar ,\nar and\nar span a\nrhombohedron of volume\n)\n(\nA\na\na\na\n=\n×\n⋅\nr\nr\nr\n. Earlier, it was noted that there are 4 basis\nmolecules per cubic unit cell. Since a primitive unit cell has only 1 basis molecule, its\nvolume should be 1⁄4 of the cubic unit cell, which is exactly what the calculation indicates.\nFig. 3 shows the primitive lattice vectors for an fcc lattice [3].\n\nFigure 3. Primitive lattice vectors with and without lattice points\n\n4. What is the structure of the reciprocal lattice?\n6. What are the primitive reciprocal lattice vectors?\n\nFrom the primitive lattice vectors defined above, the reciprocal lattice vectors are\ncalculated as [2]\na\na\na\na\na\nb\nr\nr\nr\nr\nr\nr\n×\n⋅\n×\n= π\n\n(5)\na\na\na\na\na\nb\nr\nr\nr\nr\nr\nr\n×\n⋅\n×\n= π\n\n(6)\na\na\na\na\na\nb\nr\nr\nr\nr\nr\nr\n×\n⋅\n×\n= π\n\n(7)\nPerforming the calculations indicated in Eq. (5), (6), and (7) with the values given in Eq.\n(2), (3), and (4) gives the following primitive reciprocal lattice vectors:\n)ˆ\nˆ\nˆ\n(\nz\ny\nx\nA\nb\n-\n+\n= π\nr\n\n(8)\n)ˆ\nˆ\nˆ\n(\nz\ny\nx\nA\nb\n+\n+\n-\n= π\nr\n\n(9)\n)ˆ\nˆ\nˆ\n(\nz\ny\nx\nA\nb\n+\n-\n= π\nr\n\n(10)\nHowever, these are simply the primitive lattice vectors for a bcc lattice. Thus, it is\napparent that the structure of the reciprocal lattice is body-centered cubic.\n\nThe structure of the primitive reciprocal lattice can also be described in terms of\nits Wigner-Seitz cell. The Wigner-Seitz cell is built in the following way. Consider all 8\nvectors of the form\n)ˆ\nˆ\nˆ\n(\nz\ny\nx\nA\n±\n±\n±\nπ\n. These are all reciprocal lattice vectors. Draw 8\nplanes normal to these 8 vectors at their midpoints. The smallest volume enclosed in this\nmanner is an octahedron. The corners of the octahedron thus formed are also cut by the\nplanes that are the perpendicular bisectors of 6 other reciprocal lattice vectors:\n)ˆ\n(\nx\nA ±\nπ\n;\n)ˆ\n(\ny\nA ±\nπ\n;\n)ˆ\n(\nz\nA ±\nπ\n(these vectors are sums of vectors\nib\nr\nand\njb\nr\nfrom above). These\nplanes form a cube, and therefore the Wigner-Seitz cell is a truncated octahedron in this\ncube. This Wigner-Sietz cell is usually referred to as the first Brillouin zone [3].\n\nThe surface of the truncated octahedron has 6 square faces (the intersections with\nthe 6 faces of the cube), and 8 hexagonal faces. The article, Huisinga, M., \"Ultraviolet\nphotoelectron spectroscopy and electron stimulated desorption from CaF2\", FU Berlin\nDigitale Dissertation shows the first Brillouin zone, with important points of symmetry\non it.\n\n7. What are the atomic form factors for your material?\n\nThe atomic form factor is the amplitude of the wave scattered by an atom normalized by\nthe amplitude of the wave scattered by one electron. The atomic form factor, f, is\ncalculated as\n( )\ndr\n\nsin\n0∫\ninf\n=\nξ\nπ\nρ\nξ\nr\nr\nr\nf\n\n(11)\nwhere ρ is the electron density and\nλ\nθ\nξ\nsin\n=\n(θ is the angle of diffraction) [5]. It is\nclear from Eq. (11) that\n\n=\nλ\nθ\nsin\nf\nf\n. The atomic form factors for Ga and As for\ndifferent values of\n\nλ\nθ\nsin\nare given in Table 1 [6].\n\nTable 1.

The phenomenon can\nbe explained by noting that in the molecule GaAs the \"ions\" Ga - and As + have the same\nnumber Z of electrons.\n\n1.

Reciprocal lattice in the [100], [110], and [111] planes\n\n2. Calculate the structure factors.\n\nThe structure factor for a lattice of atoms is given as [6]\n(\n)\n(\n)\n∑\n=\n+\n+\n=\nN\nn\nn\nn\nn\nn\nhkl\nlw\nkv\nhu\ni\nf\nF\nexp π\n\n(12)\nwhere the summation is over the atoms in the unit cell; h, k, l are the Miller indices; and\nu, v, w are the fractional coordinates with respect to the cubic cell lattice vectors. Eq.\n(12) can be further simplified by separating out the basis and the lattice. For GaAs, this\nyields\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n[\n]\n(\n)\n\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n=\nl\nk\nh\ni\nf\nf\nl\nk\ni\nl\nh\ni\nk\nh\ni\nF\nAs\nGa\nhkl\nexp\nexp\nexp\nexp\nπ\nπ\nπ\nπ\n\n(13)\nThe structure factor in Eq. (13) is separated into two terms. The first term is based only\non the geometry of the lattice. It is observed that if h, k, and l are mixed in terms of even\nand odd, this term will be identically zero; otherwise, it will be 4. The second term is\nbased on the basis. The coefficient on the gallium form factor is either 1, i, -1, or -i,\ndepending on the sum of h, k, and l. Thus, the structure factor can take on the values:\n(\n)\nAs\nGa\nf\nf\n±\n, (\n)\nAs\nGa\nif\nf\n±\n, and 0. As mentioned earlier, the form factors will be angle\ndependent and thus vary for the different reciprocal lattice vectors. The structure factors\nfor the reciprocal lattice vectors of interest are shown in Table 3 under Question 4.\n\n3. Describe qualitatively an experimental set-up you could use to\ndetermine the crystal structure of your material by x-ray\ndiffraction.\n\nSummary of experimental method:\n\nX-ray method:\nPowder diffraction method\n\nOperating wavelength:\n1.5418A from Kα emission of Cu source\n\nPossible CMSE facilities:\nRIGAKU 18kW Watt Rotating Anode X-ray Generator (Copper anode) Port #2\nRIGAKU 12kW Watt Rotating Anode X-ray Generator (Copper anode) Port #1\n\nCommonly used x-ray diffraction methods include the Laue method, the rotating-crystal\nmethod and the powder method. The Laue method was the first diffraction method ever\nused, and it satisfies the Bragg condition by continuously varying the wavelength of the\nincident beam during the experiment. The incident angle is fixed. On the other hand, the\nrotating-crystal and the powder methods use a monochromatic source but have the\nincident angle vary from 0° to 90°. Because of the different experimental setups, the\nLaue method usually serves to determine crystal orientation and assess crystal quality.\nThe single crystal and the powder methods are generally used to determine unknown\ncrystal structures.\nAlthough the single crystal method is more powerful and sophisticated, it is also\nmore complicated to use. A single scan with the crystal rotated only about one axis does\nnot cover the Bragg angle from 0° to 90° for all possible planes, such as those\nperpendicular to the rotation axis. A more complete analysis would require successive\nrotation about other axes. It is therefore easier to use the powder diffraction method,\nwhich can also determine the structure of GaAs.\nThe powderized specimen of GaAs is placed in a holder, which rotates about an\naxis. The random orientation of the individual crystals in the specimen ensures the\nexposure of all possible planes during a single scan. The angle θ between the\nmonochromatic incident beam and the lattice planes varies because of the random\norientation of the planes. At particular instances, a set of lattice planes will make the\ncorrect Bragg angle with the incident beam to satisfy the diffraction condition\nθ\nλ\nsin\n,\n,\nl\nk\nh\nd\nn\n=\n\n(14)\nwhere n is equal to 1 for first order diffraction, and d is the spacing between the lattice\nplanes with Miller indices [hkl]. The schematic of the diffractometer is shown in Fig. 7.\nIt should be noted that while the crystal axis is rotated by θ, the detector arm is moved by\n2θ.\n\nFigure 7: Experimental setup of the powder method. Angle θ varies from 0° to 90°. [7]\n\n3. Specify what wavelength(s) of x-ray is (are) necessary in your\nset-up.\n\nThe wavelength of the incident beam λ should satisfy the condition\nλ < 2dh,k,l\n\n(15)\nThis follows naturally from the Bragg condition in Eq. (14) since sinθ is always less than\n1. Here, the lattice spacing d will range from 1 to 6A, which means λ should not exceed\n2A. Some commonly used x-ray sources and the corresponding wavelengths are listed in\nTable 2 [6].\n\nTable 2. Commonly used x-ray K wavelengths\n\nSources\nWavelength [A]\n\nKα1\nKα2\nKα (weighed average)\nCr\n2.28970\n2.293606\n2.29100\nFe\n1.936042\n1.939980\n1.937355\nCo\n1.788965\n1.792850\n1.790260\nCu\n1.540562\n1.544390\n1.541838\nMo\n0.709300\n0.713590\n0.710730\n\nCopper is a suitable choice for this experiment because its Kα characteristic wavelength\nat 1.5418A satisfies the requirements. In addition, it is the most commonly used. JCPDS\nfiles for a copper source are readily available, and the diffractometers in the CMSE are all\nfitted with a copper anode.\n\nθ\nθ\nθ\nIncident beam\ndetector\nrotating samples\n\n3. What centrally shared facilities in the Center for Materials\nScience and Engineering would be good for your material .\n\nSince it is assumed that the GaAs is in bulk form, it is not necessary to have a\ndiffractometer that can perform glancing angle/small angle analysis. The RIGAKU\n18kW Watt unit (Port #2) or the RIGAKU 12kW Watt unit (Port #1) fitted with a copper\nanode would be a good choice.\n\n4. Calculate the ratio of the intensities expected for the following\nlines of the diffraction pattern with respect to the [111] line:\n[100], [200], [220], [311] and [400].\n\nThe relative intensity of the diffraction lines are determined by three major factors:\n(1) the structure factor F described earlier\n(2) the Lorentz factor, which arises due to the fact that the intensity of\ndiffraction is still appreciable at angles slightly different from the Bragg\nangle\n(3) the multiplicity factor p, which accounts for the fact that planes with\ndifferent orientation can give rise to the same reflection if they have equal\nspacing. For instance, in a cubic structure, both [010] and [001] will\ncontribute to the [100] reflection.\nThe intensity relation is given in Eq. (16) [6].\n\n+\n=\nθ\nθ\nθ\ncos\nsin\ncos\n|\n|\n2 p\nF\nI\n\n(16)\n\nwhere I is the integrated intensity, F is the structure factor, p is the multiplicity factor,\nand θ is the Bragg angle. The ratio in parenthesis is the Lorentz factor. It should be\nnoted that two other factors, the temperature and absorption factors, that affect the\nintensity are not included in Eq. (16). Their effects have opposite dependence on θ and\nthus, to a first approximation, cancel each other. Table 3 shows the calculated GaAs\nintensities for the different lines.\n\nTable 3.

The form factors fGa and fAs are\nobtained from Appendix 12 [6]. The actual numbers used here are obtained through a\nlinear interpolation between values in the appendix table. The multiplicity factor p is\ngiven in Appendix 13 [6]. In the literature, the line intensities for GaAs are normalized\nwith respect to the [111] line as it is in Table 3.\n\n5. What are the ratios if the material were Si? How could you use\nthis information to distinguish Si from your material by x-ray\ndiffraction?\n\nTable 4 shows the experimental line intensities for silicon [8] as well as the\npreviously calculated intensities for gallium arsenide. It is clear that the experimental\nline intensities for Si and GaAs are not drastically different. The relative ordering of\nthe line intensities is the same and the relative magnitudes are somewhat similar as\nwell.\n\nTable 4.

However,\nthis level of precision may be obtained in a laboratory, and thus the two crystals could\nbe distinguished by comparing line intensities. The line intensity depends quite\nstrongly on the geometry of the crystal lattice. Like GaAs, Si also has an fcc lattice\nwith a lattice constant of 5.4309A, compared to 5.6325A for GaAs. This similarity\nhelps to explain why the two crystals have such similar line intensities.\n\n6. Compare your calculations of the x-ray ratios with experimental\ndata for your material. Comment on the comparison.\n\nTable 6 shows the comparison between experimental and calculated line intensities.\n\nTable 6.

As\nmentioned earlier, the temperature and absorption factors have been neglected. These\nfactors become increasingly important as the Bragg angle increases. Therefore, the error\nin this first order calculation should increase with θ, which is what is observed here.\nThere are many other factors that have not been taken into account. In addition, there is\nsome variation in the published experimental data. With this in mind, one can see that\nthe agreement between calculated and experiment line intensities is acceptable.\n\nReferences\n\n[1] Blakemore, J.S.

How many force constants are required for each bond? Why?\n\nIn the Born force constant model, each bond can stretch and bend. These two degrees of\nfreedom correspond to two arbitrary constants. Thus, two force constants are required for\neach bond. These force constants are\nS\nα , the elastic constant for stretching, and\nφ\nα , the\nelastic constant for bending. Different types of bonds will have different\nS\nα and\nφ\nα\nconstants, but regardless of the number of different bond types present, there will still be\ntwo force constants for each bond.\n\n2. What is the energy of a single bond in the Born model?\n\nThe energy of a single bond in the Born model, between atom 1 at R\nr\nand atom 2\nat\n1a\nR\nr\nr\n+\n, is given as\n\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n]\n[\n]\n[\n]\n[\n]\n[\n]\n[\n]\n[\n)\n,\n(\nR\nu\na\nR\nu\na\nR\nu\na\nR\nu\nR\nu\na\nR\nu\na\na\nR\nR\nE\nS\nv\nv\nv\nv\nv\nv\nv\nv\nv\nv\nv\nv\nv\nv\nv\nv\nv\nv\nr\nr\n-\n+\n⋅\n-\n-\n+\n+\n-\n+\n⋅\n=\n+\nφ\nα\nα\n(1)\n\nwhere\nS\nα is the elastic constant for stretching of the bond,\nφ\nα is the elastic constant for\nbending of the bond,\nv\na 1 is a vector from atom 1 to atom 2,\nv\nR is a vector from the origin\nto atom 1 (and correspondingly\nv\nR + v\na 1 is a vector from the origin to atom 2), and\nv\nu [\nv\nR ]\nand\nv u [\nv\nR + v a 1] are the displacements from equilibrium of atoms 1 and 2, respectively.\n\n3. The model assumes that the bond is only slightly displaced\nfrom equilibrium. How would you modify the model to make the\nbond energy more realistically dependent on displacement from\nequilibrium - what order would the corrections be, and of what\nsign? Justify your answer physically; include sketches if\nappropriate.\n\nThe Born model implicitly incorporates the assumption that the atoms are only slightly\ndisplaced from equilibrium. This assumption affects the expressions for both the bending\nenergy Eφ and the stretching energy ES. In particular, the expression that was used for Eφ\n\nassumes small angular displacement and the expression for ES assumes small distance\ndisplacement. An exact treatment for the two energies is presented below; these results\nare then compared to the Born approximation answers.\n\nBond Bending\n\nFigure 1 illustrates the bending of a bond. The Born model assumes that for small angles\nφ, the arc length s can be approximated by the perpendicular distance x.\n\nFigure 1: Bond bending: atom with an equilibrium spacing L is bent by an angle φ\n\nThe exact calculation is shown in Eq. (2)\n(Exact)\n\nφ\nα\nα\nφ\nφ\nφ\nL\ns\nE\n=\n=\n\n(2)\nEquations (3) and (4) show the approximation steps used in the Born model\n(Born model)\n\n|\n|\nx\nu\nu\nE\njy\niy\nφ\nφ\nφ\nα\nα\n=\n-\n=\n\n(3a)\n\n)\n(\nsin\nφ\nαφ L\n=\n\n(3b)\n\n...)\n!3\n(\n+\n-\n=\nφ\nφ\nαφ L\n\n(3c)\n\n...)\n(\n+\n-\n=\nφ\nφ\nαφ L\n\n(4)\nBy comparing Eq. (2) and (4), one can see that the required correction to the bending\nenergy in the Born model is\n2 φ\nαφ L\n, which is a positive correction to the fourth order\nin φ.\ns\nx\nL\nφ\n\nBond Stretching\n\nFigure 2 illustrates the stretching of a bond.\n\nFigure 2: Bond stretching: ui and uj are the displacements of the atoms.\nIn the Born model, the component of u perpendicular to the b direction is assumed to be small.\n\n(Exact)\n\n|)\n|\n|\n(|\n|)\n|\n|\n(|\nb\nu\nu\nb\nb\na\nE\ni\nj\nS\nS\nS\nr\nr\nr\nr\nr\nr\n-\n-\n+\n=\n-\n=\nα\nα\n\n(5)\n(Born model)\n\n)]\n(\n[\ni\nj\nS\nu\nu\nb\nE\nr\nr\nr\n-\n-\n=\nα\nφ\n\n(6)\n\nThe stretching energy from the Born model assumes the component\n)\n(\ni\nj\nu\nu\nb\n-\n×\nr\nis\nsmall and is therefore ignored. For the exact solution, it has to be incorporated into the\ncalculations.\n\nThese corrections make the energy expressions more exact under the assumption\nthat the bonds can be accurately modeled as springs. This approximation may be valid for\nsmall displacements, but it is not valid for considerably larger displacements. The actual\npotential is not harmonic; it just appears harmonic around the minimum of the well.\n\n4. How many force constants will your model require and how\nlarge will the dynamical matrix be for nearest-neighbor\ncouplings? What if you use next-nearest neighbor couplings?\n\nIf you use nearest neighbor coupling or next-nearest neighbor coupling the dynamical\nmatrix will be a 6x6 matrix. The size of the dynamical matrix is determined by the\ndimensions in the problem, in this case 3, and the number of atoms per basis in the\nproblem, two in this case.\nui\nuj\nb\na\n\nOne bending constant and one stretching constant will be required for the nearest\nneighbor model since a Ga atom bonding with an As atom will require a spring stretch\nconstant αs and its associated bending constant αφ. In contrast, a next-nearest neighbor\nmodel in combination with the nearest neighbor model will require a total of six\nconstants. There will be three different types of bonds: Ga-Ga, Ga-As, and As-As. Three\nof the constants will be due to stretching in the three different types of bonds. The other\nthree constants are associated with the bending of these bonds. The dynamical matrix will\nstill be a 6 x 6 matrix in this case as formerly mentioned.\n\n5. How many independent elastic constants does your material\npossess?\n\nFor the cubic lattice of GaAs, the elastic response tensor simplifies to only three\nindependent second-order moduli given in Table 1. [1]\n\nTable 1: Elastic constants for GaAs at T = 77K and 300K\n\nElastic Constants\n[1010dynes/cm2]\nTemperature\n\nT = 300K\nT = 77K\nC11\n119.0 + 0.1\n122.1 + 0.3\nC12\n53.8 + 0.1\n56.6 + 0.3\nC44\n59.5 + 0.1\n59.9 + 0.1\n\nHow well the Born model predicts the actual elastic constant values is measured by the\nso-called \"Born ratio\". In particular, the Born ratio is required to be unity for the GaAs\nstructure, but it turns out to be 1.05 (5% discrepancy). This suggests that the nearest\nneighbor approach does not provide a general solution for cubic materials. This is\nbecause the effect from the remote neighbors in a cubic structure cannot be safely\nignored. Firstly, the next-nearest neighbors are in fact not too much further away in\nposition than the nearest neighbors. Secondly, the number of atoms increases\nsignificantly as one moves out and counts the nearest, the next-nearest, the next-next\nnearest neighbors and so on. So even though the next-nearest neighbors may not have as\n\nintimate an effect as the nearest neighbors, the fact that there are more of those types of\natoms may still give a significant effect.\n\n1. The attached drawing labels all the atoms in the basis and all\ntheir nearest neighbors. For each atom labeled A-H, verify that\nthe lattice vectors Rp to each unit cell, taking atom of type 1 in\ncell A as the origin, is given by the vectors labeled cell B, etc.\n\nGaAs has a zincblende structure, as was discussed in the first part of the project. The\nlattice is fcc with the cubic lattice constant a . Without loss of generality, one can assume\nthat the As atom is at the origin. Around this atom, there are 4 Ga atoms all at an equal\ndistance from the As atom. The coordinates of these Ga atoms as well as the unit vectors\nfrom the As atom to the Ga atoms are given in Table 2.\n\nTable 2: Positions of Ga atoms neighboring As atom at origin\nNeighboring\nAtom\nx-coordinate\n(a)\ny-coordinate\n(a)\nz-coordinate\n(a)\nUnit vector from\nAs atom to Ga atom\n1⁄4\n1⁄4\n1⁄4\na A = 1\n3 ( ˆ x + ˆ y + ˆ z )\n-1⁄4\n-1⁄4\n1⁄4\na B = 1\n3 (-ˆ x -ˆ y + ˆ z )\n1⁄4\n-1⁄4\n-1⁄4\na C = 1\n3 ( ˆ x -ˆ y -ˆ z )\n-1⁄4\n1⁄4\n-1⁄4\na D = 1\n3 (-ˆ x + ˆ y -ˆ z )\n\nAround each Ga atom, there are 4 As atoms at an equal distance from the Ga atom. For\nexample, around the (1\n4 , 1\n4, 1\n4) ⋅a Ga atom, there are 4 equally spaced As atoms. The\nlocations of these As atoms as well as the unit vectors from the Ga atom are given in\nTable 3.\n\nTable 3: Positions of As atoms neighboring Ga atom at (1⁄4, 1⁄4, 1⁄4)a\nNeighboring\nAtom\nx-coordinate\n(units of a)\ny-coordinate\n(units of a)\nz-coordinate\n(units of a)\nUnit vector from\nGa atom to As atom\n)ˆ\nˆ\nˆ\n(\nz\ny\nx\naE\n-\n-\n-\n=\n1⁄2\n1⁄2\n)ˆ\nˆ\nˆ\n(\nz\ny\nx\naF\n-\n+\n=\n\n1⁄2\n1⁄2\n)ˆ\nˆ\nˆ\n(\nz\ny\nx\naG\n+\n+\n-\n=\n1⁄2\n1⁄2\n)ˆ\nˆ\nˆ\n(\nz\ny\nx\naH\n+\n-\n=\n\n2. Attached is a general expression for the potential energy of all\nthe atoms in the crystal in terms of their displacements from\nequilibrium. A Born force model was used which considers only\nnearest neighbor interactions to simplify this expression.\n\nThe basis of the lattice is an As atom at (0,0,0)⋅a and a Ga atom at (1\n4 , 1\n4, 1\n4) ⋅a . The\nbasis is at a location\nv\nR from an arbitrary origin. The following cells will be considered:\n(1) cells which have as origins the 4 As atoms specified in Table 3.\nThese cells will have displacement vectors u 1[R ], u 1[R + cellF ],\nu 1[R + cellG ], and u 1[R + cellH ] where cellF = ( 1\n2 , 1\n2 ,0) ⋅a = a\n2 ( ˆ x + ˆ y ),\ncellG = (0, 1\n2 , 1\n2) ⋅a = a\n2 ( ˆ y + ˆ z ) , and cellH = (1\n2 ,0, 1\n2) ⋅a = a\n2 ( ˆ x + ˆ z ).\n(2) cells which contain the 4 Ga atoms specified in Table 2.\nThe origins of these cells are at (0,0,0)⋅a ,\ncellB = (-1\n2, -1\n2 ,0) ⋅a = a\n2 (-ˆ x -ˆ y ) , cellC = (0, -1\n2 ,-1\n2) ⋅a = a\n2 (-ˆ y -ˆ z ),\nand cellD = (-1\n2 ,0,-1\n2) ⋅a = a\n2 (-ˆ x -ˆ z ).\n\nThe total elastic potential energy for the collection of these cells and atoms will be:\n\n{\n}\n{\n}\n{\n}\n{\n}\n{\n}\n{\n}\n{\n}\n])\n[\n]\n[\n(\n]\n[\n]\n[\n])\n[\n]\n[\n(\n]\n[\n]\n[\n])\n[\n]\n[\n(\n]\n[\n]\n[\n])\n[\n]\n[\n(\n])\n[\n]\n[\n(\n])\n[\n]\n[\n(\n])\n[\n]\n[\n(\n]\n[\n]\n[\n])\n[\n]\n[\n(\n]\n[\n]\n[\n])\n[\n]\n[\n(\n]\n[\n]\n[\n])\n[\n]\n[\n(\n]\n[\n]\n[\n])\n[\n]\n[\n(\n])\n[\n]\n[\n(\n])\n[\n]\n[\n(\n])\n[\n]\n[\n(\nH\ncell\nR\nu\nR\nu\na\nH\ncell\nR\nu\nR\nu\nG\ncell\nR\nu\nR\nu\na\nG\ncell\nR\nu\nR\nu\nF\ncell\nR\nu\nR\nu\na\nF\ncell\nR\nu\nR\nu\nH\ncell\nR\nu\nR\nu\na\nG\ncell\nR\nu\nR\nu\na\nF\ncell\nR\nu\nR\nu\na\nD\ncell\nR\nu\nR\nu\na\nD\ncell\nR\nu\nR\nu\nC\ncell\nR\nu\nR\nu\na\nC\ncell\nR\nu\nR\nu\nB\ncell\nR\nu\nR\nu\na\nB\ncell\nR\nu\nR\nu\nR\nu\nR\nu\na\nR\nu\nR\nu\nD\ncell\nR\nu\nR\nu\na\nC\ncell\nR\nu\nR\nu\na\nB\ncell\nR\nu\nR\nu\na\nR\nu\nR\nu\na\nV\nD\nC\nB\nD\ns\nC\ns\nB\ns\nD\nc\nB\nA\nD\ns\nC\ns\nB\ns\nA\ns\n+\n-\n⋅\n-\n-\n+\n-\n+\n+\n-\n⋅\n-\n-\n+\n-\n+\n+\n-\n⋅\n-\n-\n+\n-\n+\n+\n-\n⋅\n-\n+\n+\n-\n⋅\n-\n+\n+\n-\n⋅\n-\n+\n+\n-\n⋅\n-\n+\n-\n+\n+\n-\n⋅\n-\n+\n-\n+\n+\n-\n⋅\n-\n+\n-\n+\n-\n⋅\n-\n-\n+\n+\n-\n⋅\n+\n+\n-\n⋅\n+\n+\n-\n⋅\n+\n-\n⋅\n=\nφ\nφ\nφ\nφ\nφ\nφ\nφ\nα\nα\nα\nα\nα\nα\nα\nα\nα\nα\nα\nα\nα\nα\n(7)\nwhere the first 4 terms are stretching with the As atom at the origin, the next 4 terms are\nbending with this atom, the next 3 terms are stretching with the Ga atom, and the last 3\nterms are bending with the Ga atom.\n\n3. Use the expression for the potential energy to determine the\nforce on a given atom in the crystal in terms of its displacement\nand its neighbor's displacements. Check your answers by\ndirectly calculating the force from the spring constants and\ndisplacements.\n\nCalculating the force on a given atom using the expression for the potential\nenergy requires careful calculation of partial derivatives. In the model that is considered\nhere, it is only necessary that the force on one atom of the basis be calculated with respect\nto its neighbors, because the force on the other atom of the basis can be determined\nthrough symmetry considerations, etc. The force on atom 1 at the origin will be\n\ncalculated. Thus, attention will be restricted to those terms in the potential energy that\ncontain\n]\n[\n1 R\nu\n. The potential energy is broken up into four separate parts as described\nearlier. The first part is the stretching energy for atoms connected to atom 1 at the origin.\nThe second part is the bending energy for atoms connected to atom 1 at the origin. The\nother two terms describe energy due to atom 2 and are therefore unimportant here.

Write a Matlab code to find the phonon spectra for general\nvalues of your force constants and atomic masses. Plot the\nphonon dispersion in appropriate units along the Γ-X, X-L, and\nΓ-L directions using force constants of αS =1, αφ =0.25, and\nM1=M2=1.\n\nOnce the dynamical matrix has been specified, the calculation of phonon dispersion is\nrelatively straightforward. For each value of k, the corresponding frequencies are related\nto the eigenvalues of the matrix\n)\n(\nk\nD\nM -\n(the eigenvalues actually being the squares of\nthe frequencies). In this way, there is a relation from k to ω. If there were exactly one ω\nfor each k, the relation would simply be a function. For a free particle, each k\ncorresponds to exactly one frequency ω, and thus ω=f(k).\nTo actually obtain the dispersion curves along the desired directions, the path in\nk-space was sampled at a finite number of points. At each sample point, representing a\nspecific k value, the eigenvalues of\n)\n(\nk\nD\nM -\nwere numerically calculated. Since the\nmatrix is 6x6, there were 6 (perhaps non-distinct) ω values for each k. In this calculation,\nthe physical parameters that are ordinarily material specific are the lattice spacing a, the\nmasses of the Ga (M1) and As (M2) atoms, and the spring constants αstretch and αbend. In\n\nthis part however, the values M1=M2=1 and αstretch=1 and αbend=0.25 were used. Since all\nthe groups used the same values for mass and spring constants, this part served as a\nmeans of checking the accuracy of the numerical Matlab code. The lattice spacing used\nhere was a = 5.6325A, the actual value for GaAs. Since units were not specified in the\noriginal definition of constants, it was assumed that standard SI units were implied. Thus,\nthe mass of the atoms used in the calculation was (the extremely large value of) 1kg each,\nand the spring constants used were αstretch=1 N/m and 0.25 N/m for αstretch and αbend,\nrespectively. The only adjustable parameter in this computation was the number of\nsample points along the path.\nThe graph of the dispersion relation is shown in Fig. 3. In this figure, the three\ndifferent colors represent the three different arcs of the path. The dispersion relation for\nthe arc from Γ to X is shown in red. The dispersion relation for the direct path from X to L\nis shown in green. The arc from L to Γ is shown in blue. Notice that although the paths\nfrom Γ to X and L to Γ represent movements along the Brillouin zone, the segment from\nX to L actually passes through the interior of the Brillouin zone. The portion in green,\ntherefore, does not represent a symmetry direction. It is not surprising therefore that only\nfour lines are seen on the paths from Γ to X and L to Γ (because the two transverse\ndirections are degenerate) whereas six lines are seen on the X to L path because the\nsymmetry is broken in this direction.\nThe numbers on the x-axis give the total distance traveled in q-space from the\nstarting point at Γ. Thus, it is clear that the total trip from Γ to X to L back to Γ is a\ndistance of approximately 2.75 units in q-space. The y-axis is frequency. The particular\nscaling of the frequency axis results from the initial choice of constants and their\nassociated units. The fact that the shape matches the expected shape (as given by the\nother groups) gives some validation to the Matlab code that generated it and further\nresults. The M-file that calculates phonon spectra for a general values of force constants\nand atomic masses is called JJCB_B5.m, the first part of the name being the first initials\nof the group members and the second part for the question.\n\nFigure 3: Phonon dispersion curves with standard mass and spring coefficients\n\n6. For these values of force constants and masses, determine the\natomic displacements for all the modes at Γ, and for the highest\noptic and lowest acoustic modes at X and L. Provide drawings\nof the atomic motion of these modes. How many modes are\nthere at Γ?\n\nDetermination of atomic displacements requires that the eigenvectors of\n)\n(\nk\nD\nM -\nbe\ncalculated along with the eigenvalues. The results of these calculations are shown in\nTables 4, 5, and 6 for the atomic motion at Γ, X, and L, respectively. The eigenvalues and\neigenvectors were calculated in Matlab.\n\nTable 4: All frequencies and atomic displacements for phonon modes at Γ\nFreq. ω\n(Hz)\nx\nu1\ny\nu1\nz\nu1\nx\nu2\ny\nu2\nz\nu2\n-0.7071\n-0.7071\n-0.7071\n-0.7071\n-0.7071\n-0.7071\n-0.7071\n0.7071\n0.7071\n-0.7071\n-0.7071\n0.7071\n\nThe first three modes in Table 4 correspond to simple translations and thus do not\nreally represent vibrational modes. The other three modes are optical modes. The movies\nfor these modes can be accessed by running the M-files: Gamma_opt_1.m,\nGamma_opt_2.m, and Gamma_opt_3.m, respectively. From the movies, it is clear that\nthe motion of each individual molecule is repeated throughout the crystal, i.e. there is no\nvariation in the motion across the crystal. In the movies, the lines are used to indicate the\nbonds between the Ga and As atoms when the atoms are in equilibrium and serve to\nidentify an inertial frame.\n\nTable 5: Frequencies and atomic displacements for highest optical and lowest acoustic modes at X=[1 0 0]\nFreq. ω\n(Hz)\nx\nu1\ny\nu1\nz\nu1\nx\nu2\ny\nu2\nz\nu2\n1.7321\n-0.7071\n0.7071\n1.7321\n0.7071\n-0.7071\n-0.7071\n-0.7071\n-0.7071\n-0.7071\n\nThe first two modes in Table 5 are the two (degenerate) highest optical modes.\nThe movies for these modes can be accessed by running the M-files: X_opt_1.m and\nX_opt_2.m, respectively. The last two modes in Table 5 are the two (degenerate) lowest\nacoustic modes. The movies for these modes can be accessed by running X_ac_1.m and\n\nX_ac_2.m, respectively. From the movies, it is clear that the motion of the atoms varies\nacross the crystal, in particular along the x-direction. The atoms that are at the midpoint\nin the x-direction move in the opposite direction to those that are at the two ends of the x\naxis in the cubic cell.\n\nTable 6: Frequencies and atomic displacements for highest optical and lowest acoustic modes\nat\n\n=\n\nL\n\nFreq. ω\n(Hz)\nx\nu1\ny\nu1\nz\nu1\nx\nu2\ny\nu2\nz\nu2\n1.8708\n0.5000\n-0.5000\n0.5000\n-0.5000\n1.8708\n-0.2887\n-0.2887\n0.5774\n-0.2887\n-0.2887\n0.5774\n0.7071\n-0.5000\n0.5000\n0.5000\n-0.5000\n0.7071\n0.2887\n0.2887\n-0.5774\n-0.2887\n-0.2887\n0.5774\n\nAs was true in the previous case, the first two modes in Table 6 are the two\nhighest optical modes. The Matlab files are L_opt_1.m, and L_opt_2.m, respectively. The\nother two modes are the two lowest acoustic modes. The corresponding movies are in\nL_ac_1.m and L_ac_2.m, respectively. The variation of the motion across the crystal is\nconsiderably more complicated than in previous cases. This fact is to be expected since\nall components of the k-vector are nonzero here.\n\nModel Optimization and Comparison to Macroscopic Properties\n\nTo determine appropriate values for the spring constants, it is necessary to fit some form\nof calculated data with experimental data. It is known beforehand that the Born model\napproximation used here cannot match the experimental data perfectly because the model\nused here has only two adjustable parameters whereas the real crystal has three\nindependent elastic constants. The estimation of the spring constants was done by\nmatching calculated zone edge frequencies with experimental values.\nOne can observe that all of the terms in the dynamical matrix can be written in\nterms of the ratio of the two spring constants and a scaling factor. Thus, first the ratio of\nthe spring constants\nφ\nα\nα S was estimated. This ratio was estimated by searching for the\nvalue that minimized the error between the calculated and experimental ratio of\nfrequencies at\n\n=\n\nL\n. At L, there are four frequencies. Normalizing these\nfrequencies, the best least squares fit was found for the ratio\nφ\nα\nα S using a simple\nsearch. Once the ratio of the two constants was found, the appropriate scaling factor\nneeded to be determined. To estimate the scaling factor, the magnitude of the highest\nfrequencies at Γ and L were used. In the experimental data, there are two optical\nfrequencies at Γ. However, in the nearest-neighbor model used here, there will always be\nonly one optical frequency at Γ. Therefore, the average of these two values was used as\nthe experimental optical frequency at Γ. A least-squares fit gave an estimate for the\nnecessary scaling factor, again using a simple search.\nWith the scaling factor and the ratio, the two spring constants were determined.\nWith an estimate for these spring constants, other macroscopic properties could be\ncalculated. The calculated and experimental zone-edge frequencies are shown in Table 7.\nThe zone-edge frequencies are calculated from the eigenvalues of\n)\n(\nk\nD\nM -\nfor the\nspecific values of k that correspond to the zone-edges. The table shows that the\ncalculated and experimental values have fairly good agreement, with only one of the\nentries having a percent difference larger than 20%.\n\nTable 7: Measured and calculated zone-edge frequencies\n\nMode Description\nMeas.

In fact, the calculations consistently underestimate these values. This\nfact indicates one or more of the following: the spring constants chosen are not the true\noptimum, the wave speeds are being calculated incorrectly, or the underspecified Born is\nnot useful for accurate estimates of the wave speed.\n\n1. Plot a comparison of your calculated phonon dispersion with\ntheoretical and/or experimental results along the Γ-X, X-L, and\nΓ-L directions.\n\nFig. 4 shows the calculated phonon dispersion curves; the experimental phonon\ndispersion curves are shown in: Blakemore, J.S., \"Semiconducting and other major\nproperties of gallium arsenide.\" J. Appl. Phys. 53(10), Oct. 1982.\n\nFigure 4: Calculated phonon dispersion curves for GaAs\n\nThe calculated and experimental phonon dispersion curves have the same general\nshape and share many features. There is a gap at X and the general shape of the Γ-X\nand Γ-L regions are the same. The path from X-L is not shown because it is not along\na symmetry direction as discussed earlier.\n\n2. Plot the total density of states (histogram method, include all\nmodes) versus frequency.\n\nFigure 6 shows the total density of states as determined through the histogram method. In\norder to obtain a total density of states, periodic boundary conditions are applied. The\napplication of periodic boundary conditions discretizes the k values and correspondingly\nthe ω values as well. Thus, to do the actual calculation, the k-space is sampled and the ω\nvalues are determined for every sample point. Once one knows all the ω values, a simple\nhistogram gives the required total density of states.\n\nThe density of states shown in Fig. 6 below agrees well with the published\nexperimental figure for the density of states in Blakemore, J.S., \"Semiconducting and\nother major properties of gallium arsenide.\" J. Appl. Phys. 53(10), Oct. 1982.\n\nFigure 6: Calculated density of states for GaAs\n\n3.

The\n( ) ω\nω\nσ\nd\ng\nterm is simply the number of states in each bin with center at ω.

The integral given in Eq.\n(26) can be found tabulated in [2] for T between 0 and ΘD. For the range beyond ΘD a\nstraight line approximation was made from T= ΘD to T= 3ΘD, where at T= 3ΘD, Cv was\nset to 2, corresponding to the high temperature approximation that Cv=3nkBT (n referring\nto density of atoms here).\n\nFor the combined model, the Debye equation is used for the acoustic modes and\nthe Einstein specific heat is used for optical modes.

It makes sense to choose the frequency that has the\nhighest density of modes, which is what has been done here. In this combined model,\nsince the Debye approximation is only being used for the acoustic modes, the specific\nheat just due to the Debye part should be half of what it was earlier.\n\nFigure 8: Specific heat calculated a number of ways.\n(Note that n refers to the density of molecules, not atoms.)\n\nIt can be seen that both the Debye alone and the combined Debye-Einstein\napproximations match up very closely with the calculated specific heat using the\ncalculated density of modes. Starting at T ≈ 0, it is clear that the calculated\nspecific heat does not display the T 3 dependence that actually exists. This\ndependence is correctly captured by both the Debye and the Debye-Einstein\nmodels. The general shape of all the curves is the same and all come very close to\nthe high temperature limit value of Cv=2 (for the units chosen on this plot). The\nDebye model underestimates the specific heat throughout the entire temperature\nrange. This result is in fact to be expected because the Debye model cannot take\ninto account the peak in the density of modes at a large ω value. The Debye-\nEinstein model on the other hand does a much better in this respect. Since the\nmode chosen for the Einstein model was at a very high frequency, adding in the\n\nEinstein model increases the estimate of the specific heat. From the author's\nperspective, the only thing really surprising about Fig. 8 is that the\napproximations seem to match up too well to the calculated specific heat. It is not\nclear to this author why the agreement should be so good when it seems that the\napproximations made are rather crude in some sense!\n\nReferences\n\n[1] Blakemore, J.S.

For our LCAO model we construct our trial wave function\ntypically using only the outermost orbitals. In other words, in a\nsystem with b atoms in the basis and n outermost orbitals per\natom, the total number of orbitals in the LCAO wave function is\nnb. How many atomic orbitals will you have for your material?\nWhy?\n\nOur material is gallium arsenide (GaAs). The electronic structures of atomic Ga (31\nelectrons) and As (33 electrons) are given as:\nGa:\np\ns\nd\np\ns\np\ns\ns\n\n(1)\nAs:\np\ns\nd\np\ns\np\ns\ns\n\n(2)\nThe valence, or outermost, electrons of Ga and As are the ones with principal quantum\nnumber n=4. In GaAs, the wave functions for these valence electrons are well described\nby the 4s and 4p wave functions of each atom, i.e., by the\ns\n4 ,\nx\np\n,\ny\np\n, and\nzp\n\norbitals of Ga and As.\nThe basis of the GaAs crystal has 2 atoms (one Ga and one As). If the valence\nelectrons are shared equally between the two, there are 4 outermost orbitals per atom, so\nthe total number of orbitals in the LCAO wave function is\n2×\n=8. Thus, the\nHamiltonian will be an\n8× matrix. Here, a linear combination of atomic orbitals has\nbeen assumed. We know from elsewhere that the tetrahedral structure of GaAs leads to\nsp3 hybridization. The sp3 hybrid orbitals can however be expressed as linear\ncombinations of the atomic s and p orbitals. Therefore, the LCAO approximation used\nhere is fairly good.\n\n2. Conceivably, one could also construct the LCAO wave function\nout of core orbitals as well as valence orbitals. If you did so,\nhow many atomic wave functions would you have to use for\nyour material? How large would your Hamiltonian matrix be in\nthis case? How do you expect your results would differ from\n\nthose you would get with just valence bands? What if we used\nhigher orbitals, too? How many orbitals per atom would we\nhave to use to get an \"exact\" band structure? Why?\n\nThe atomic electronic structures of Ga and As were listed above in Eq. (1) and (2). From\nthese equations, it is seen that Ga and As both have 14 core atomic orbitals. There are one\n1s, 2s, and 3s orbitals each; there are three 2p and 3p orbitals each; and there are five 3d\norbitals for each atom. Combining the 28 total core orbitals with the 8 total valence\norbitals gives 36 orbitals. Thus, 36 orbitals will be needed if both core and valence\norbitals are included in the LCAO model for GaAs. The Hamiltonian matrix will\ncorrespondingly be\n36×\n.\nOriginally, when only the valence orbitals were included, only 8 bands were\nfound. If all the core orbitals were also taken into account, then 36 bands would be\ncalculated. These extra bands would lie below the previously calculated bands.\nConsequently, we would now have estimates for energies of lower lying bands. The\noriginal 8 bands would be only slightly affected by using a much larger Hamiltonian\nmatrix. Since more basis functions are being used, we would expect that the calculated\nstructure for the original 8 valence and conduction bands would improve, albeit only\nslightly, over the band structure determined when only the valence orbitals were used in\nthe LCAO.\nWe can also include totally unoccupied orbitals. Since there are an infinite\nnumber of energy levels up to the 0 (free) energy, we could use an infinite number of\nunoccupied levels. Of course, adding unoccupied orbitals will increase the size of the\nHamiltonian matrix and therefore increase the number of bands calculated. The extra\nbands would lie above the conduction bands calculated with valence orbital LCAO.\nThese bands are almost completely empty at any moderate temperature, so they would\nnot have a strong influence on the valence and conduction bands. However, they should\nimprove the valence and conduction band calculations marginally because as more\norbitals are added, the finite basis expansion more closely approximates a complete basis.\nTo get an exact answer, we would have to have a complete basis, which requires that all\nthe orbitals, an infinite number, be used (core, valence and unoccupied).\n\n1.

Look up a \"real\" energy band diagram for your material\nThe experimentally determined band diagram for GaAs is shown in: Blakemore, J.S.\nSemiconducting and other major properties of gallium arsenide. J. Appl. Phys. 53(10),\nOct. 1982.\n\n2. Write a Matlab program to plot the free-electron band structure\nfor your material along the same directions as used in the\nenergy band you found in the literature. Indicate the\ndegeneracies of the different bands. Where is the Fermi level\nlocated? How does the free electron band structure compare to\nthe real band structure?\n\nA substantial amount of information can be obtained about the Bloch electron assuming\nthe electron experiences zero potential energy. In the free-electron model, we solve the\nSchrodinger's Equation by setting the potential V(r) to be zero. The solution consists of\nplane waves with a continuous wave vector k and energies given by Eq. (35). The\nrelationship between E and k is parabolic.\n)\n(\nk\nm\nk\nE\nv\nh\nv\n=\n\n(35)\nThe free-electron energy bands can be represented in the reduced zone scheme. The\nwave vector k is reduced to the first Brillouin zone by a suitable choice of reciprocal\nlattice vector G:\nG\nk\nk\nv\nv\nv\n+\n=\n'\n\n(36)\n\nwhere G is defined by the linear superposition of primitive reciprocal lattice vectors b1, b2\nand b3:\nbl\nb\nq\nb\nh\nG\nv\nv\nv\nv\n+\n+\n=\n\n(37)\n\nFor a face-centered cubic lattice, it is much more convenient to rewrite G in terms of the\northogonal unit vectors:\n\n]ˆ\n)\n(\nˆ\n)\n(\nˆ\n)\n[(\nz\nl\nk\nh\ny\nl\nq\nh\nx\nl\nq\nh\na\nG\n-\n+\n+\n+\n-\n+\n+\n+\n-\n=\nπ\nv\n\n(38)\nwhere a is the conventional lattice constant and is 5.65325A for GaAs. We can now\nrewrite the energies in the reduced zone scheme notation:\n)\n'\n(\n)\n(\nG\nk\nm\nk\nE\nv\nv\nh\nv\n+\n=\n\n(39)\nwhere k' is restricted within the first Brillouin zone. The corresponding energy band\ndiagram for a face-centered cubic is shown in Fig. 8. The bands from L to Γ were plotted\nin pink, Γ to X in blue, X to (K ,U) in red, and K to Γ in green. Consider the Γ point with\nk' = [0 0 0]. The lowest energy band is given by setting G in Eq. (38) to zero (h= q= l=\n0). The minimum of the point is E = 0 which increases parabolically until it reaches the\nzone boundaries at the X-point on the right (\n)\n(\na\nm\nE\nπ\nh\n=\n) and L-point on the left\n(\n)\n(\na\nm\nE\nπ\nh\n=\n). The next energy value at the Γ-point occurs by setting either one of\nh, q or l to be +1. With the same idea, the complete energy bands were computed by\nincreasing the indices h, q and l and evaluating E at the different symmetry points.\n\n-0.5\n0.5\n1.5\nFree-Electron Energy Bands\nW ave Vector k (arb. unit)\nEnergy (eV)\n\nFigure 8: Free-electron band structures along symmetry directions for GaAs. (applied to any face-centered\ncubic structure) The dotted line shows the approximate Fermi energy level at T=0.\n\nThe accepted free-electron band structure is shown in: Kittel, C., Introduction to Solid\nState Physics, 1986. The computed results agree extremely well with literature. An\ninteresting point to note is that we computed the bands from X to U [1 1/4 -1/4] instead of\nX to K [3/4 3/4 0] in order to match the results from the literature.\n\nAt zero temperature the Fermi energy for free electrons is given by:\n/\n)\n(\nn\nm\nEF\nπ\nh\n=\n\n(40)\nwhere n is the electron number density. For GaAs, n ~ 5 x 1022/cm3, and thus EF ~4.9eV.\nThe Fermi level is shown in Fig. 8.\n\nThe energies are degenerate if different combinations of (h,q,l) give the same energy\nvalues. Referring to the Γ point example mentioned before, the next energy value at the\nΓ-point will be 6-fold degenerate since either one of h, q or l being +1 will give the same\nL Γ X K,U Γ\n\nenergy.

The first observation is that although the free-electron band structure gives a\nfairly good approximation to the shape of the bands, it shows no evidence of energy gaps.\nIn addition, a lot of the degeneracy is removed in the real band structure.\n\n3. Algebraically diagonalize the Hamiltonian matrix at the G point.\nWhat are the different energies and eigenvectors, and what do\nthey correspond to physically?

To diagonalize a symmetric matrix like this, you use the eigenvalue equation\nHV=VE\n\n(42)\nWhere V is a matrix of eigenvectors, and E is a diagonal matrix of eigenvalues, which\nhappen to be the energies. Pre-multiplying both sides of the equation gives\nV-1HV=E\n\n(43)\nThus, diagonalizing the H matrix gives the energies along the diagonal. The eigenvectors\nand eigenvalues for this system can be found from inspection. As an example, to find two\nof the eigenvalues, we solve the pair of simultaneous equations\nEs1ε1 + 4Essε5 = E ε1\n\n(44)\n4Essε1 + Es2ε5 = E ε5\n\n(45)\nThis set of equations can be solved analytically for E as\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\nss\ns\ns\ns\ns\ns\ns\nE\nE\nE\nE\nE\nE\nE\nE\n-\n-\n+\n±\n+\n=\n\n(46)\nThus, Eq. (45) gives us two values for the energy. Once we have the energy, we can\ncalculate the corresponding eigenvectors. We simply substitute the two values of E\n\nobtained from Eq. (46) into Eq. (44) and (45) and get two eigenvectors. The results of\nthis process are given in Tables 1 and 2 below. Table 1 shows the calculated eigenvalues\nor energies for this matrix along with a comparison with literature values [1]. The\ncalculated energy values have been scaled so that zero corresponds to the top of the\nvalence band.\nTable 1: Calculated vs Experimental Values for Energy at G point [1]\nCalculated Energy (eV)\nMeasured Energy (eV)\n-12.64\n-12.6\n-0.5\n3.12\n1.4\n3.12\n4.7\n3.12\n4.7\n6.42\n4.7\n\nThe table shows that the calculated and experimental values for the energy levels at the\nΓ point are reasonably close.

It is seen that all of the eigenvectors have only two non-\nzero components. We already knew this from before when we demonstrated the\ncalculation of energies and eigenvalues analytically. With these eigenvectors, the energy\ncan actually be estimated as well because if the eigenvector is mainly weighting one of\nthe atomic orbital functions, then the corresponding energy for that eigenvector will\napproximately be equal to the energy of the atomic orbital.\n\n4. Write a Matlab program to plot the LCAO energy bands along\nthe same directions as above, along with the approximate\nlocation of the Fermi level. How do your results compare\nqualitatively with the band structure you found in the literature?\nOptimize the matrix elements for your material if you wish.\n5. Where are the valence band maximum and conduction band\nminimum located? What is the energy gap? Is your material\ndirect or indirect?\n\nThe Hamiltonian matrix obtained in part B was used to find the energy bands. Recall that\nwe chose the trial wave function to be a linear combination of 4s, 4px, 4py, 4pz orbitals\nfrom each Ga and As atoms. The resulting 8x8 Hamiltonian matrix should give 8\neigenenergies for each [kx ky kz], thus we expect to get 8 energy bands. The values for\nthe physical parameters used in the computation were from the Solid State table [3] and\nare summarized in Table 3. The LCAO band diagram along the same symmetry points is\nshown in Fig. 11. The zero energy point was taken to be the maximum of the valence\n\nband.\n-0.5\n0.5\n1.5\n2.5\n-14\n-12\n-10\n-8\n-6\n-4\n-2\nLCA O E nergy B ands\nW ave V ector k (arb. unit)\nEnergy (eV)\n\nFigure 11: LCAO energy bands for GaAs. The zero energy point is chosen to be the maximum of the\nvalence band (at the Γ point).\n\nThe 8 energy bands are best evidenced along the K-Γ direction. The 3rd and 4th bands and\nthe 7th and 8th bands are degenerate for X-Γ and L-Γ. Although there is a band gap\nbetween the first two bands, it is not of main interest since they are all filled up and\ndoesn't contribute to the semiconducting properties. The actual semiconductor gap is\nlocated between the 4th (valence band) and the 5th (conduction band). The energy gap is\nthe difference between the maximum of the valence band (EV= 0eV) and the minimum of\nthe conduction band (EC =2.91eV). The resulting band gap of 2.91 eV is much higher\nthan the accepted value of 1.43eV for GaAs. This discrepancy naturally posed a need to\noptimize the matrix elements. We fudged the four overlap parameters Vssσ, Vspσ, Vppσ\nand Vppπ since they are the most crucial matrix elements. The optimized values are\nsummarized in Table 3.\n\nTable 3: The numerical values of the physical parameters used in the computation. The first set was\nobtained from the solid state table [3] and the second set was the optimized values. The band gaps\ncomputed with each set of values are also shown.

[3]. The improved LCAO band structure is shown in Figure 12.\nIt can be seen that the shapes of the band structures agree more with the literature (Fig. 7)\nand the corresponding band gap is 1.88eV. The discrepancy is reduced from 103% to\n31%. It should be noted that the optimization process did not only take into account the\nenergy gap but also the shape of the bands as well.\n\n-0.5\n0.5\n1.5\n-14\n-12\n-10\n-8\n-6\n-4\n-2\nLCA O E nergy B and (with optim ized m atrix elem ents)\nW ave V ector k (arb. unit)\nEnergy (eV)\n\nFigure 12: Improved LCAO energy bands with optimized matrix elements for GaAs. The locations of the\nvalence band minimum and conduction band maximum both occur at the Γ point, indicating that GaAs has\na direct band gap. The Fermi energy level at T = 0 is mid-way between the band gap (dotted line).\n\nThe Fermi energy level as a function of temperature is given by\n)\nln(\nNc\nNv\nkT\nEv\nEc\nEF\n+\n+\n=\n\n(47)\nwhere k is Boltzmann constant, Nv and NC are the degeneracy at Ev and Ec respectively.\nAt zero temperature, it is mid-way between the energy gap and is approximately EF0\n~0.94eV with Ev being the zero energy point. At higher temperature, it will be slightly\nshifted towards the valence band.\nThe energy bands obtained using the LCAO method compares well with the real\nenergy bands. The LCAO approach is particularly useful in providing information about\nthe presence and location of the energy gaps, and the general trend of the bands.\nHowever its limitation lies in the inability to predict some band features including the\ndips and also the fine separation of some of the nearly degenerate bands.\nNevertheless, the LCAO band diagram accurately predicts the locations of the\nvalence band minimum and the conduction band maximum; they both occur at the Γ\npoint. Therefore GaAs is a direct band gap material, with a band gap computed to be\n1.88eV (31% discrepancy).\nL Γ X K Γ\n\nNevertheless, the LCAO band diagram accurately predicts the locations of the\nvalence band minimum and the conduction band maximum; they both occur at the Γ\npoint.

Plot constant energy contours near the valence and conduction\nband edges for \"appropriate\" planes. Fig13, Eq48\n\nThe constant energy contours along selected planes are shown below. Since the\nmaximum energy in the conduction band and the minimum energy in the valence band\noccur at Γ = (0,0,0) for our direct material, a plot of the energy contours along the kx-ky\nplane (kz=0) and along the kx-kz plane (ky=0) will be a suitable choice to capture the\nenergy content about the band gap of our material.\n\nFigure 13: Constant energy contours along selected planes\n\n2.

This would allow for more curvature in the energy band\ndispersion relationship, and therefore improve the estimation for the effective mass\ncalculations.\nTable 5: Valence band effective mass\nEffective Mass\nLiterature Values [1]\nCalculated Values\nConduction Band\nmc0 = 0.067m0\nmc=.2 m0\nLight Hole Band\nml = .082 m0\nml = .33m0\nSplit Off Band\nms0=0.154 m0\nms0=0.15 m0\nHeavy Hole Band\nmh = 0.51m0\nmh = 1.41m0\n\n3. Plot the total density of states versus energy. Use your\ncalculated effective masses to determine an approximate\nexpression for the density of states near the valence and\nconduction band edges. How does this calculation compare\nwith the total D.O.S.?\n\nFigure 16 shows the calculated density of states using the histogram method.\n\nFigure 16: Density of States\nAn approximation for the total density of states could be made by using the calculated\nvalues for the effective mass in the conduction and valence band and the equations shown\nbelow\n*\n*\n)\n(\n)\n(\nh\nE\nE\nm\nm\nE\ng\nc\nc\nc\nc\nπ\n-\n=\n\n(54)\n/\n/\n*\n/\n*\n*\n]\n)\n(\n)\n(\n[\nv\nv\nveff\nm\nm\nm\n+\n=\n\n(55)\n*\n*\n)\n(\n)\n(\nh\nE\nE\nm\nm\nE\ng\nv\nveff\nveff\nv\nπ\n-\n=\n\n(56)\nThe 2 in front of the first term results from the fact that the first band is doubly\ndegenerate [5]\n\nUsing our calculated values for mveff\n* = .576 and mc\n* = .2 m0, we obtain the plots\nshown in the figure below where the solid lines represent the analytical expression using\nthe calculated effective masses.\n\nFigure 16: Density of states near the conduction and valence band edges\nand effective mass approximation\n\n4. Using your total D.O.S., calculate the electronic specific heat of\nyour material as a function of temperature. Compare this with\nyour calculations for the phonons, and comment.\n\nIn calculating the specific heat of GaAs, a numerical integration technique is utilized in\norder to use the numerical density of states.

It is still unclear to us what the relevant temperature range should be and how the\nexact specific heat calculation should be done. Initially, we tried to calculate the energy\ndensity using the valence and conduction bands. However, this appeared to give us a\nspecific heat of zero due to some type of cancellation. Then, upon the (perhaps nebulous)\nadvice of a former student, we tried calculating the specific heat using only the\nconduction bands. This idea seemed to make sense because the valence band is pretty\nmuch full, so there is not much room for the valence electrons to increase in energy while\nstill staying in the valence bands. The conduction band electrons, however, have access to\na seemingly infinite number of free states to which they can be excited by thermal\nenergy. Therefore, the specific heat was calculated using only the conduction band\ndensity of states. Perhaps this approximation becomes less valid as the temperature\nincreases and there are a greater fraction of available states in the valence bands,\nimplying that the specific heat due to valence band electrons cannot be ignored.\nWe expect the semiconductor to behave as an insulator at low temperatures and a\nconductor at high temperatures. In an insulator, there are no available energy levels to\nwhich electrons can transition (that are of the same order of magnitude as the thermal\nenergy). Therefore, the electronic specific heat should be zero for the insulator. In a\n\nmetal, the electronic specific heat has a linear variation with temperature. We therefore\nexpect that the electronic specific heat will start at zero and become linear at some point.\nInitially, we plotted Fig. 17 shown below.\n\nFigure 17: Electronic specific heat up to 300K\n\nFrom this plot, it seemed like the \"knee\" for the transition between nonzero specific\nheat and linear specific heat occurred around 275K. In order to compare the electronic\nspecific heat to the phonon specific heat, we decided to plot over a much larger\ntemperature range. This plot is shown as Fig. 18. Figure 18 seems to indicate that the\n\"knee\" is around 2500K. Upon some consideration, this latter temperature seemed\nmore reasonable because 2500K ~ 0.2 eV and the bandgap is on the order of an\nelectron-Volt.\n\nFigure 18: Electronic specific heat up to 1000K\n\nWe already know that the phonon specific heat dominates over the electronic specific\nheat for high temperatures. We also know that the total specific heat saturates at high\ntemperatures. Obviously then, the electronic specific heat cannot continue to grow\nindefinitely. In a metal, the phonons freeze out below some temperature and only\nelectrons contribute to total specific heat. Here, however, it seems that the electrons\nalso \"freeze out\" because they are virtually all in the valence band and do not have\nenough energy to jump into the conduction band. So, it is not necessarily true that\nelectrons are dominant for very small temperature either, even though the phonon\nspecific heat displays a T3 dependence around T=0. However, these are issues that the\nauthors have not fully understood at this point.\n\n5. Use the band structure you found in the literature to discuss the\ncharacteristics of your material. What electronic / optical\napplications would your material be good / bad for? Why?\n\nThere are two main characteristics of the GaAs band structure which can be exploited for\nelectronic and/or optical applications. They are the fact that GaAs has a direct bandgap at\nΓ and that the effective mass of the electron is far less than it is for silicon (0.067m\ncompared to 0.19m for light electrons in Si). In addition, the light holes in GaAs are\n0.074m compared to 0.16m for Si.\n\nA direct bandgap occurs when the minimum of the conduction band occurs at the\nsame point in k-space as the maximum of the valence band. In semiconductors with a\ndirect bandgap, an electron can make a transition from the valence band to the conduction\nband with simply a change in energy. In indirect bandgap semiconductors, the electron\nmust also change its momentum when it transitions. In indirect bandgap semiconductors,\na third particle is required for momentum conservation. Silicon has an indirect bandgap.\nBecause only an energy change is required for direct bandgaps, an electron can make\ntransitions between the conduction and valence bands by emitting or absorbing a single\nphoton. No other particles are needed. For this reason, GaAs is a very useful material for\nmaking light-emitting or light-detecting devices. Thus, GaAs is often used for LEDs as a\nlight source and CCDs as a light detector.\n\nThe effective mass of electrons and holes in GaAs can also be exploited for\ncommercial purposes. Since the charge carriers are \"lighter\" than they are in silicon, one\nwould suppose that they could be accelerated faster and perhaps to higher velocities\n(although the latter does not necessarily hold). However, it does turn out that GaAs has a\nhigher electron mobility than silicon by a factor of six and a half. The increased mobility\nallows for faster electronics because electrons move through transistor channels and\njunctions much quicker. In practical terms, this corresponds to faster switching speeds for\ndigital electronics and higher operational frequency for both analog and digital\ncomponents. Indeed GaAs is very commonly used for applications that place such\ndemands.\n\n6. Plot the 3D constant energy surfaces near the top of the\nvalence band and bottom of the conduction band.\n\nThe figure below shows constant energy surfaces near the bottom of the conduction band.\n\nReferences\n\n[1] Blakemore, J.S.

      "content": "6.730 PHYSICS FOR SOLID STATE APPLICATIONS\n\nDepartment of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\n\n\"REAL\" SEMICONDUCTOR PROJECT\n\nIntroduction\n\nThis is an extensive project intended to introduce you to something approximating the real world of solid\nstate calculations. Because this is a \"real\" problem, you are encouraged to collaborate with classmates and\nwork in teams if you so desire. However, everyone must turn in their own project.\nEach team will be assigned a different semiconductor material to use throughout the project. The project\nconsists of the following three parts: First, you will be asked to describe fully a material's crystal structure,\nand to determine x-ray diffraction patterns for it. The second section of the project involves development of\na model for the material's vibrational properties (phonon dispersion relationships, elastic constants, specific\nheat, etc.). In the final part of the project, you will use an LCAO model to calculate the material's\nelectronic band structure (energy gap, whether the material is direct or indirect, effective densities of states\nfor the valence and conduction bands, etc.). Throughout the project you are expected to check how\ngood/bad your calculations are on the basis of real experimental and theoretical results. In general, your\ncalculations should yield reasonable (within 20-30%) answers, so these experimental checks are a good way\nto ensure that you're on the right track.\nThis project does involve both library research and significant matlab coding. Much of the information you\nneed can be found in the books that are on reserve. All literature sources you use must be documented\nappropriately. All matlab code must be sent by email, as well as included, with comments, as an appendix\nto the project.\n\nPart I: Crystal Structure\n\nThis part of the project is relatively simple, but it does lay important ground work for the second and third\nparts of the project. When you do the research for this section, be sure to make copies of any information\nyou find on your material--it will come in handy for parts II and III.\n\nDo appropriate research to answer the following questions about your material:\n\n1. What is the crystal structure?\n2. What is the lattice constant?\n3. What is the basis?\n4. What are the primitive lattice vectors?\n5. What is the structure of the reciprocal lattice?\n6. What are the primitive reciprocal lattice vectors?\n7. What are the atomic form factors for your material?\n\nThe following can be done by hand, or by using matlab where appropriate:\n\n1. Provide pictures of the crystal and of the reciprocal lattice in the [100], [110], and [111] planes.\nIndicate the vertical positions of atoms with respect to the plane (see, for example, Kittel p. 19).\n2. Calculate the structure factor for all reciprocal lattice vectors G of magnitude |G|2 < 16(2π/a)2. Be sure\nto include the atomic form factors.\n3. Describe in detail an experimental setup you could use to determine the crystal structure of your\nmaterial by x-ray diffraction. Provide appropriate figures. Specify what wavelength(s) of x-ray is(are)\nnecessary in your setup. Suggest possible sources.\n4. Calculate and draw the expected x-ray diffraction pattern(s) from your setup. Discuss (with\ncalculations) how the pattern(s) would be used to determine the crystal structure.\n5. Try to find experimental results for x-ray diffraction on your material. Compare with your predicted\nresults and comment on any discrepancies you find.\n\n6.730 PHYSICS FOR SOLID STATE APPLICATIONS\n\nDepartment of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\n\n\"REAL\" SEMICONDUCTOR PROJECT\n\nPart II: Phonons\n\nIn this part of the project, you will be developing a simple model for the phonon spectra of your\nsemiconductor. The game plan here is to develop a general model for the phonon dispersion relationship, in\nterms of some unknown force constants, and then to use experimental data to fit the force constants to the\nmaterial. The model you will be using is a Born force constant model that incorporates bond bending and\nbond stretching, as we discussed in class.\nA. Background Questions\nFor the Born force constant model, we can consider just nearest neighbor interactions, or we can make the\nmodel more accurate (and more complicated) by including next nearest neighbors, next-next nearest\nneighbors, etc. Before beginning on your calculation, answer the following general questions about the\nBorn model:\n1. How many force constants are required for each bond? Why?\n2. What is the energy of a single bond in the Born model?\n3. The model assumes that the bond is only slightly displaced from equilibrium. How would you modify\nthe model to make the bond energy more realistically dependent on displacement from equilibrium--\nwhat order would the corrections be, and of what sign? Justify your answer physically; include\nsketches if appropriate.\n4. If you use only nearest-neighbor couplings, how many force constants will your model require for your\nmaterial? How large will the dynamical matrix be? What if you use nearest neighbor and next nearest\nneighbor couplings?\n5. How many independent elastic constants does your material possess? What are they (give numbers)?\nWhy will a nearest-neighbor approach not provide the most general solution for a cubic material?\nB. Construction of Dynamical Matrix\nIn fact, a nearest neighbor calculation that accounts for bond bending actually does a good job (within\n20%), and is significantly more tractable than the next nearest neighbors approach. We will therefore start\nout with a nearest neighbors approach; next nearest neighbors will be left as an extra credit bonanza for the\ndiligent among you.\n1. Draw all the atoms in the basis and all their nearest neighbors. Label the atoms according to their\nlattice vector and basis vector.\n\n2. Write a general expression for the potential energy of all the atoms in the crystal in terms of their\ndisplacement from equilibrium. Use a Born force model which considers only nearest neighbor\ninteractions to simplify this expression (your expression should contain force constants and\ndisplacements at this point).\n3. Use your simplified expression for the potential energy to determine the force on a given atom in the\ncrystal in terms of its displacement and its neighbors' displacements. Check your answer by directly\ncalculating the force from the spring constants and displacements.\n4. Use your simplified expression for the potential energy to calculate the dynamical matrix. Is it\nHermitian?\n5. Write a matlab code to find the phonon spectra for general values of your force constants and atomic\nmasses. Plot the phonon dispersion in appropriate units along the Γ-X, X-L, and Γ -L directions using\nforce constants of αBEND=1, αφ=0.25, and M1=M2=1.\n6. For these values of force constants and masses, determine the atomic displacements for all the modes at\nΓ, and for the highest optic and lowest acoustic modes at X and L. Provide drawings of the atomic\nmotion of these modes. How many modes are there at Γ?\nC. Model Optimization and Comparison to Macroscopic Properties\nLook up experimental results for phonon dispersion in your material. Using whatever criteria you deem\nappropriate (sound velocities, elastic constants, zone edge frequencies, etc.), determine optimum values of\nyour force constants to match measured results. Calculate sound velocities, zone edge frequencies, and\nelastic constants (c11, c12, and c44) using your model and compare with values from the literature. Show all\nyour calculations.\nUsing your model, do the following:\n1. Plot a comparison of your calculated phonon dispersion with theoretical and/or experimental results\nalong the Γ-X, X-L, and Γ -L directions.\n2. Plot the total density of states (histogram method, include all modes) versus frequency.\n3. Calculate the specific heat of your material versus temperature using (a) your calculated density of\nstates, (b) a Debye model, and (c) a combined Debye-Einstein model (Debye for acoustic modes,\nEinstein for optical modes). Plot your results for temperatures between 0 K and 3ΘD.\nComment on the strengths and weaknesses of your model. If you so desire, extend it to next nearest\nneighbors (this is not required, but if you're bored one Saturday night...)\n\n6.730 PHYSICS FOR SOLID STATE APPLICATIONS\nDepartment of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\n\"REAL\" SEMICONDUCTOR PROJECT\n\nPart III: Electronic Band Structure\nIn this part of the project, you will be developing an LCAO picture for the valence and conduction bands of\nyour semiconductor. As in the phonon part of the project, you will first develop a general form for the\nsolution. You will then apply that form to your material, compare your calculated results with results\nreported in the literature, and use your results to evaluate physically interesting material properties.\nA. Background Questions - Before developing the Hamiltonian matrix, answer the following general\nquestions about the LCAO method:\n1. For our LCAO model we construct extended orbital basis functions, |χα(k)>, which are in turn used to\nconstruct our trial wave function, |ψ(k)>. Typically use only the outermost (highest principal quantum\nnumber) orbitals to construct our different |χα(k)>, so that in a system with b atoms in the basis and n\noutermost orbitals per atom, the total number of extended orbital basis functions is nb. How many\nextended orbital basis functions will you have for your material? Why?\n2. Conceivably one could also construct |χα(k)> out of core orbitals as well as valence orbitals. If you did\nso, how many extended orbital basis functions would you have to use for your material? How large\nwould your Hamiltonian matrix be in this case? How do you expect your results would differ from\nthose you would get with just valence orbitals? What if we used higher (totally unoccupied) orbitals,\ntoo? How many orbitals per atom would we have to use to get an \"exact\" band structure? Why?\nB. Construction of Hamiltonian Matrix\n1. What are the atomic configurations of the two atoms in your material? Which orbitals do you expect to\nplay a significant role in bonding?\n2. Draw all the atoms in the basis and all their nearest neighbors with appropriate orbitals on each atom.\nLabel the orbitals according to their lattice vector, basis vector, orbital type, and the type atom they are\nassociated with (cation or anion). For example, the s orbital on the cation at lattice vector R, basis\nvector τ would be labeled |φsc(R+τ)>\n3. Show that one can approximate all the nearest neighbor interactions with one of the following (to\nwithin a sign). Pictorial arguments (with accompanying explanation) are acceptable.\nEss=<φsc(0)|H|φsa(a/4,a/4,a/4)>\nEsp=<φsc(0)|H|φpxa(a/4,a/4,a/4)>\nExx=<φpxc(0)|H|φpxa(a/4,a/4,a/4)>\nExy=<φpxc(0)|H|φpya(a/4,a/4,a/4)>\nIs this approximation reasonable? Comment on the validity of\n<φsc(0)|H|φpxa(a/4,a/4,a/4)> = <φsa(0)|H|φpxc(a/4,a/4,a/4)>\nGiven this approximation, can we write\n<φsc(0)|H|φsc(0)> = <φsa(a/4,a/4,a/4)|H|φsa(a/4,a/4,a/4)> ?\nCalculate values for Ess, Esp, Exx, and Exy in terms of Vssσ, Vspσ, etc. (see PS 6).\n4. Construct a set of extended atomic orbitals. Be explicit about your choice of phase factors. Write your\ntrial wave function as a linear combination of these extended orbitals.\n\n5. Find the Hamiltonian matrix for the nearest neighbor approximation. Your answer should contain only\nEss, Esp, Exx, Exy, the s and p energies of the anion and cation (Esa, Esc, Epa, and Epc) and phase factors.\nNOTE: You will be able to find this matrix in the literature. However, several of the sources\n(including Harrison, 1980 and Slater and Koster, 1954) have minor errors in their matrices or matrix\nelements, so check your answer carefully. If you are really motivated, find H for next-nearest\nneighbors, too...\nC. Band Calculations\n1. Look up a \"real\" energy band diagram for your material. Include a copy in your report.\n2. Write a matlab program to plot the free-electron band structure for your material along the same\ndirections as used in the energy band you found in the literature [Note: neglecting factors of π/a, the\nsymmetry points are Γ =(0,0,0); X=(1,0,0); L = (1/2, 1/2, 1/2); K=(3/4, 3/4, 0); and W=(1, 1/2, 0)].\nIndicate the degeneracies of the different bands. Where is the Fermi level located? How does the free\nelectron band structure compare to the real band structure?\n3. Algebraically diagonalize the Hamiltonian matrix at the Γ point. What are the different energies and\neigenvectors, and what do they correspond to physically (hint: look back at PS 1)? Using Harrison's\nSolid State Table (attached) find numerical values for Esa, Esc, Epa, Epc, Ess, Esp, Exx, and Exy. Compare\nyour calculated energies at the Γ point with values from the literature.\n4. Write a matlab program to plot the LCAO energy bands along the same directions as above, along with\nthe approximate location of the Fermi level. How do your results compare (qualitatively) with the band\nstructure you found in the literature? If you wish, optimize the matrix elements for your material.\n5. Where are the valence band maximum and the conduction band minimum located? What is the energy\ngap? Is your material direct or indirect?\nD. Effective Masses, Constant Energy Surfaces, Density of States - Since you are working in 3D, it will\nprobably prove rather challenging to plot the 3D constant energy surfaces near the valence band and\nconduction band edges. If you can figure out a good way to do this (that doesn't involve making an\neffective mass approximation) you will be rewarded with many bonus points and a Toscanini's gift\ncertificate. Failing that,\n1. Plot constant energy contours near the valence and conduction band edges for \"appropriate\" planes.\nFor example, if your minimum is at kmin along Γ-X, you should probably plot an energy contour for the\nkx-ky plane, and for the plane parallel to ky-kz that contains kmin. For a minimum along Γ-L, the plane\ncontaining the Γ-L direction and the plane perpendicular to that direction would make sense.\n2. Solve for the energy at a number of k points near the valence and conduction band edges. Fit these\npoints using a quadratic polynomial (be sure to think about your results from D1 when you do this).\nUse your results to find the effective masses for both the valence bands and the conduction band. How\ndo your results compare with results from the literature? How would you improve your results?\n3. Plot the total density of states (histogram method, include all bands) versus energy. Use your calculated\neffective masses to determine an approximate expression for the density of states near the valence and\nconduction band edges. How does this calculation compare with the total D.O.S.?\n4. Using your total D.O.S., calculate the electronic specific heat of your material as a function of\ntemperature. Compare this with your calculations for the phonons, and comment.\n5. Use the band structure you found in the literature to discuss the characteristics of your material. What\nelectronic/optical applications would your material be good/bad for? Why?\n\n6.730 PHYSICS FOR SOLID STATE APPLICATIONS\n\nDepartment of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\n\n\"REAL\" SEMICONDUCTOR PROJECT\n\nYour assigned material is:\n\n3C-SiC AlAs\n\nGaP-I\nGaAs\nInP\n\nInAs\n\nGaSb-I"
