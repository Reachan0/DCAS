The purpose of this course is to find ways to deal with the vast array of information we have about Congress. The two basic questions we will be asking are (1) what does Congress do and why, and (2) what are the various ways of studying congressional behavior?\n\nTo accomplish these goals, this subject is organized around two major learning modules: Lectures / discussion and paper / problems. The lecture / discussion part will expose you to the basic social facts about Congress: What it takes to get elected, how Congress works internally, and how the relationships between Congress and the rest of the federal government are organized. The paper will focus on the 2016 congressional election and its aftermath. It will allow you to analyze the outcomes of this important national election in light of the research on elections and internal politics you will learn about. The problems will help you internalize spatial models as applied to legislatures. There will also be a take-home exercise that will allow you to explore how gerrymandering affects election outcomes.\n\nThis subject introduces students to Congress, primarily undergraduates, but graduate students who have never studied Congress are welcome, too. It is more empirical than theoretical, although theory encroaches here and there.\n\nGrading\n\nACTIVITIES\n\nPERCENTAGES\n\nClass attendance and discussion (including roundtable contributions)\n\n20%\n\nProblem sets\n\n20%\n\nMidterm exam\n\n15%\n\nRedistricting exercise\n\n15%\n\nPaper\n\n15%\n\nFinal exam\n\n15%",

Wade,\" the 1973 decision\nlegalizing abortion.\nBush might like the idea of having O'Connor, the swing vote\non the court, as chief justice for just two to three years, after\nwhich she likely would retire -- giving the Republican\npresident another crack at altering the court's makeup,\nTotenberg said.\nFrom The Buffalo News, May 16, 2002, p. b4.\nThese images are in the public domain.\n\nThese images are in the public domain.\nIn seven years on the Supreme Court, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy has been neither ideological\nleader nor political strategist. His writings have drawn little attention from law reviews, and it is\npart of court lore that he's so little known a group of tourists once asked him to take their picture.\nWhile Kennedy may lack the bold personality or compelling background of other justices,\nhe has earned one important distinction: On a closely divided court, he holds the decisive\nvote.\nAlong with Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, Kennedy will be the justice to watch as the court\nin the weeks ahead decides major cases involving free speech rights, the separation of church\nand state and the constitutionality of government policies based on race. More often than\nO'Connor, however, it is Kennedy who casts the fifth -- and deciding -- vote and in recent years\nhe has been in the majority on important cases more than any other justice.\nMany of Kennedy's prominent \"fifth votes\" have led to liberal rulings. But Kennedy is overall a\nconservative jurist, refusing to expand the role of the courts in American life and believing\nsocial policy is best left to elected officials.\nFrom Washington Post, June 11, 1995, p. a2\n\nThese images are in the public domain.\nTo be sure, the chief justice considers himself the custodian of the Supreme Court's prestige,\nauthority and legitimacy, and he is often its voice in major cases. There was reason, then, to\nthink he might have provided a sixth vote to uphold the law had Justice Anthony M. Kennedy\njoined the court's four-member liberal wing. That would have allowed Chief Justice Roberts, the\nthinking went, to write a narrow, grudging majority opinion. But almost no one thought that he\nwould provide the fifth vote, joining only the liberals, to uphold a Democratic president's signal\nlegislative achievement.\n...\nThe court Chief Justice Roberts leads is not leaving the national spotlight. The next term already\nincludes a major case on affirmative action in higher education, and cases on voting rights and\nsame-sex marriage are likely to follow. All will test the chief justice's leadership, and the novel\nalignment in Thursday's case is unlikely to be repeated. In cases concerning the role of race in\nadmissions and voting, he is likely to take his usual place with the court's conservatives. In\ncases on gay rights, Justice Kennedy is likely to be the swing vote.\nFrom the New York Times, June 29, 2012, p. A1\n\nThese images are in the public domain.\nX\nWhile state officials have suffered legal setbacks in North Carolina, Texas and Wisconsin -- here\nfederal courts restored some early-voting opportunities, seen as beneficial to African Americans\n-- only North Carolina has tried to get the Supreme Court to put the lower-court decisions on\nhold. But without Scalia, who died in February, to provide a fifth vote for conservatives, the\nhigh court deadlocked 4 to 4 and the lower-court rulings remained in place.\nFrom the Washington Post, September 5, 2016\n\nThese images are in the public domain.\nX\nWhile state officials have suffered legal setbacks in North Carolina, Texas and Wisconsin -- here\nfederal courts restored some early-voting opportunities, seen as beneficial to African Americans\n-- only North Carolina has tried to get the Supreme Court to put the lower-court decisions on\nhold.

Scheduling in the Senate by Complex\nUnanimous Consent Agreements\n-UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--H.R. 1191\n- Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at a time to be determined by the majority leader, with the concurrence\nof the Democratic leader, the Senate proceed to vote on the motion to proceed to calendar No. 30, H.R. 1191, and that if the motion to\nproceed is agreed to, Senator Corker or his designee be recognized to offer a substitute amendment, which is the text of S. 615 as\nreported by the Foreign Relations Committee.\n- The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n- The minority leader.\n- Mr. REID. Mr. President, I reserve my right to object, ... [says nice things about Democrats involved in negotiating the bill.] But we\nare not there yet. Remember, we had a problem with this initially because of the language in the bill. So every word is going to have to\nbe read with this new language that is drawn up, and then we will see if we can make it to the finish line. I think we can, but we are\ncertainly not there yet. But progress has been made.\n-[More kind words for Senators Cardin and Corker]\n- But I note that the majority leader is once again choosing not to move to the nomination of Loretta Lynch as Attorney General. It has\nbeen more than 5 months--it will be 6 months in a week or 10 days--since President Obama nominated her. Her nomination has been on\nthe Senate calendar for 49 days, longer than the last 7 Attorney General nominations combined.\n-[Asks that the Lynch nomination be added to the UA]\n- The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the majority leader so modify his request?\n- Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, as I have indicated, gosh, at least for 6 weeks now, we are going to deal with the Lynch nomination\nright after we finish trafficking. [Say more things about getting the trafficking bill passed.]\n- Therefore, I object to the modification.\n- The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection to the modification is heard.\n- Mr. REID. Mr. President, continuing my reservation, [capitulates].\n- The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\nHR 1191 was Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of 2015\n\n11.

The\npriority value is determined by multiplying the population\nof a state by a 'multiplier.' For example, following the\n1990 census, each of the 50 states was given one seat out\nof the current total of 435. The next, or 51st seat, went to\nthe state with the highest priority value and thus became\nthat state's second seat.\nSource: https://www.census.gov/topics/public-sector/congressional-apportionment.html\n\nPriority values after 2010\nSeat # State\nPriority #\n51 California Seat 2\n26,404,773\n52 Texas Seat 2\n17,867,469\n53 California Seat 3\n15,244,803\n54 New York Seat 2\n13,732,759\n55 Florida Seat 2\n13,364,864\n. . .\n431 Florida Seat 27\n713,363\n432 Washington Seat 10\n711,867\n433 Texas Seat 36\n711,857\n434 California Seat 53\n711,308\n435 Minnesota Seat 8\n710,230\n436 North Carolina Seat 14\n709,062\n437 Missouri Seat 9\n708,459\n438 New York Seat 28\n706,336\n439 New Jersey Seat 13\n705,164\n440 Montana Seat 2\n703,158\nThanks to http://www.thegreenpapers.com/Census10/ApportionMath.phtml\n\nReapportionment Change in 2010\nCourtesy of the U.S. Department of Commerce.

His position is one of anomalous insignificance and\ncurious uncertainty. Apparently he is not, strictly speaking, a part of the legislature,--he\nis clearly not a member,--yet neither is he an officer of the executive. It is one of the\nremarkable things about him, that it is hard to find in sketching the government any\nproper place to discuss him. He comes in most naturally along with the Senate to which\nhe is tacked; but he does not come in there for any great consideration. He is simply a\njudicial officer set to moderate the proceedings of an assembly whose rules he has had\nno voice in framing and can have no voice in changing. His official stature is not to be\ncompared with that of the Speaker of the House of Representatives. So long as he is\nVice-President, he is inseparable officially from the Senate; his importance consists in\nthe fact that he may cease to be Vice-President. His chief dignity, next to presiding over\nthe Senate, lies in the circumstance that he is awaiting the death or disability of the\nPresident. And the chief embarrassment in discussing his office is, that in explaining how\nlittle there is to be said about it one has evidently said all there is to say.\nThis quote is in the public domain.\nFrom Woodrow Wilson, Congressional Government, chap. 4\n\n114th House\nPosition\nRep\nDem\nConstitutional head\nSpeaker\nJohn Boehner (OH)\nFloor leader\nMajority.
