  "course_description": "This course is an intensive introduction to Old English (also called Anglo-Saxon), the ancestor of modern English that was spoken in England ca. 600–1100. In the first half of the term, students use short prose texts to study the basics of Old English grammar. They go on to read short poems, and conclude by tackling portions of the epic Beowulf in the last third of the term. Assessment is based upon translation work, daily vocabulary quizzes, and three exams.",

The language of Rohan in the novels of Tolkien, Old English speaks of long, cold, and lonely winters; of haunting beauty found in unexpected places; and of unshakable resolve in the face of insurmountable odds. It is, in short, the perfect language for MIT students.\n\nAfter quickly learning the basics of grammar and vocabulary, we will read greatest (bloodiest) hits from the epic\nBeowulf\nas well as moving laments, the personified Cross's first-person account of the Crucifixion, and riddles whose solutions range from the sacred to the obscene.\n\nBook List\n\nRequired\n\nPeter Baker,\nIntroduction to Old English,\nrd\nedition.

[Preview with\nGoogle Books\n]\n\nComments about These Books\n\nOur main textbook will be Baker's\nIntroduction to Old English\n(IOE), but I am asking you to get Mitchell and Robinson (M&R) as well because their handling of the grammar is more detailed and technical; that may appeal to some of you, and all of us will benefit from having the same grammatical principles laid out in different ways. (M&R also includes several texts we will be working with that IOE inexplicably does not, including\nBeowulf).\n\nWord-Hoard\nis a wonderful guide to the most common word-groups of the Old English poetic corpus. Its word-groups are organized with attention to shared etymologies that will help anyone who has studied another Indo-European language, and will interest anyone with any degree of native curiosity (which you clearly have, or you wouldn't have signed up for Old English). Its word-groups will also serve as the basis of your daily vocabulary quizzes.\n\nFinally, I am assigning Seamus Heaney's translation of\nBeowulf,\nwhose popularity is well-deserved despite its occasional idiosyncrasies. (The version that I assign also includes the Old English text, which will prove handy when we come to work with the original.)\n\nYou may acquire any edition of these textbooks that has the assigned readings, but it is YOUR responsibility to make sure that it does indeed have them (consult the\nReadings\nsection); one thing editors sometimes do between editions is change up reading selections.\n\nI have also assigned two optional texts.\nThe Word Exchange\nis a very cool set of loose, poetic renderings of the entire Old English poetic corpus (save\nBeowulf,\nof which many translations exist). We will discuss a few of these early in the semester while we're knee-deep in grammar, but those who are interested (or completionists) may be interested in the whole volume. Finally, Clark-Hall is the standard \"intermediate\" dictionary if you want a hard copy.\n\nYour final resource is not a book but a website,\nOld English Aerobics\n, which is a set of online exercises keyed to Baker's IOE. I have not formally assigned anything from here, but I've played around with it and found it useful, especially for drilling verb forms. Poke around at it according to your interest and sense of your own needs in terms of paradigm reinforcement.\n\nGrading Policy\n\nACTIVITIES\n\nPERCENTAGES\n\nExams 1, 2, and 3\n\n25% each or increasing gradually in weight (15, 25, and 35%), whichever benefits you more. We move extremely quickly early in the semester, the on-ramp to this material is steep, and not everyone will start with the same linguistic background. I am committed to making the class accessible to all, however, and the variable exam weighting is one way of doing so without penalizing anyone (since this subject is not graded on a curve, a practice that MIT has long rightly prohibited).\n\nDaily vocab quizzes\n\n10%\n\nAttendance, participation, and preparation\n\n15%\n\nCalendar\n\nUnit One: Old English Grammar and Short Prose\n\nSession 1\n\nCourse introduction; preliminary discussion of case system and pronunciation.\n\nSession 2\n\nVocab quiz.\n\nSession 3\n\nVocab quiz.\n\nIn-class translation: Minitext A.\n\nSession 4\n\nVocab quiz.\n\nIn-class translation: Minitext B.\n\nSession 5\n\nVocab quiz.\n\nIn-class translation: excerpts from the Old English prose translation of Genesis.\n\n[I strongly urge you to use\nOld English Aerobics\nto drill verb forms over the weekend!]\n\nSession 6\n\nVocab quiz.\n\nIn-class translation: Genesis, continued.\n\nSession 7\n\nVocab quiz.\n\nSession 8\n\nVocab quiz.\n\nMock Exam 1 (PDF)\ndistributed (complete and bring to class for session 9).\n\nSession 9\n\nDiscussion of mock exams.\n\nSession 10\n\nExam 1 (on cases, declension of pronouns, noun and verb form recognition, principles of syntax, and WH groups 1-60; will also include basic assisted and sight translation).\n\nUnit Two: Longer Prose and Short Poems\n\nSession 11\n\nVocab quiz.\n\nSession 12\n\nVocab quiz.\n\nSession 13\n\nVocab quiz.\n\nSession 14\n\nVocab quiz.\n\nMock Exam 2 distributed (to be discussed during session 16).\n\nSession 15\n\nVocab quiz.\n\nSession 16\n\nVocab quiz.\n\nDiscussion of mock exams.\n\nSession 17\n\nExam 2 (Vocabulary, WH groups 1-135, and translation, assisted and sight)\n\nUnit Three: Longer Poems\n\nSession 18-24\n\nVocab quizzes.\n\nSession 25\n\nVocab quiz.\n\nDiscussion of Exam 3; subject evaluations to be completed in class.\n\nSession 26\n\nExam 3 (covering all of\nWord-Hoard\nand translation, assisted and sight).",

(28)\nSection 3: Grammatical principles (36 points; ca. 10 minutes; bullet-point answers fine!)\n1. Briefly explain the semantic difference between the two forms of the verb beon (2 pts).\nThe \"b\"-forms of the verb (e.g., beo, bist, biþ) are used to express either futurity or a constant,\n\"always true\" state of affairs, like \"the sun is a distant star\"; the other, verb-initial forms (e.g.,\neom, eart, is) designate a current but changeable state of affairs, like \"the sun is shining,\" which\nmight or might not be the case at any given time (Baker 67).\n2.

Briefly explain when you can expect to see the strong forms of adjective and when the weak\n(4 pts).\n\nArthur Bahr\nOld English and Beowulf Mock Exam Key\nAdjectives take the weak form if they follow a demonstrative pronoun or possessive adjective [or\ngenitive noun or noun phrase]; otherwise they take the strong form (Baker 89 vs. M&R ₴64).\n4. What two words can you expect to see serving as a relative pronoun? What is the key\ndifference between them? (4 points)\nThe two possible words are þe and a form of se/seo/þæt. The former is indeclinable, while the\nlatter agrees in case and number with the role that it serves in the following clause (Baker 47-48).\n5. List at least three situations in which you would expect to find the subjunctive form of a given\nverb (3 pts; extra credit for providing more than 3).\n1. Contrary-to-fact clauses (e.g., \"if I were rich,\" implying that I'm not)\n2. In clauses following verbs of commanding and desiring (e.g., \"I insisted that he go home\")\n3. To express doubt or ignorance (e.g., \"he wondered if she were wise\") or in reported action of\nwhich the speaker has no direct knowledge (where it may alternate with the indicative)\n4. In concessive clauses (those that begin with words like although, despite, even if)\n5. Hortatory subjunctive (e.g., let them eat cake; may he be damned)\n(Baker 85-88)\n6. What is unusual about the 2nd- and 3rd-person singular forms of Old English strong verbs? Is\nthe distinctiveness of these forms related to the vowel gradations that govern the strong verb\nclasses? (2 pts)\nThey display i-mutation, but this vowel shift is not related to the vowel gradations that define\nother strong verb forms (Baker 75).\n7. What are three possibilities about a given word that should occur to you upon seeing the -um\nending? (3 pts)\n1. Dative singular strong adjective\n2. Dative plural adjective\n3. Dative plural noun\n8. What are three possibilities about a given word that should occur to you upon seeing the -an\nending? (3 pts)\n1. Infinitive\n2. One of many weak noun forms\n3. One of many weak adjective forms\n\nArthur Bahr\nOld English and Beowulf Mock Exam Key\n9. What are two possibilities about a given word that should occur to you upon seeing the -ra\nending? (2 pts)\n1. Genitive plural of many nouns, adjectives, and pronouns\n2. Comparative adjective (e.g., heardra)\n10. Many Old English prepositions can take both the dative and the accusative. What is the\nsemantic suggestion of using one as opposed to the other? (2 pts)\nThe dative implies rest or stability; the accusative implies motion or purpose.\n11. What is a preterite-present verb? List at least four common ones (5 pts).\nPreterite-present verbs use what look like strong-verb preterite forms to express present-tense\nmeaning. Common such verbs include cunnan, magan, motan, sculan, þurfan, and witan (Baker\n80-81).\n12. What are two frequent complications with how compound subjects are handled in Old\nEnglish? (2 pts)\n1. The two (or more) parts of the compound noun may be separated from one another (see\nexamples on Baker 108-09).\n2. When this happens, the verb typically agrees with the first part of the subject (Baker 108).\nSection 4: Sight Translation (50 points; ca. 25-30 minutes)\n1. Þa bær1 se goda mann hringas2 in þæs dryhtnes healle.\nThen the good man bore rings into the lord's hall.\n1 From beran\n2 Hring, strong masc. noun: ring and/or suit of (ring-mail) armor\n\nArthur Bahr\nOld English and Beowulf Mock Exam Key\n2.
