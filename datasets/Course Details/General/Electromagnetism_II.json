Either hand it in at the lecture, or by 5:00\npm in the 8.07 homework box.\nREADING ASSIGNMENT: Chapter 1 of Griffiths: Vector Analysis.\nPROBLEM 1: VECTOR IDENTITIES INVOLVING CROSS PRODUCTS\n(20 points)\nIn manipulating cross products, it is useful to define εijk (the Levi-Civita antisym\nmetric symbol) to be:\n\n+1 if ijk = (123, 231, 312)\nεijk =\n-1 if ijk = (213, 321, 132)\n(1.1.1)\n\n0 otherwise .\nThat is, εijk is nonzero only when all three indices are different; it is then equal to +1\nif ijk is a cyclic permutation of 123, and -1 if ijk is an anti-cyclic permutation. Note\nthat εijk is totally antisymmetric, in the sense that it changes sign if any two indices are\ninterchanged:\nεijk = -εikj = εkij .\n(1.1.2)\nWith this definition, the ith component of the cross product of two vectors AB and B can\nbe written as\n\nAB × BB\n= εijkAj Bk ,\n(1.1.3)\ni\nwhere we have used the summation convention that repeated indices are summed over\n\n(that is, εijk AjlBkm =\nεijk AjlBkm). For the rest of this problem set, we will\nj=1 k=1\nalways assume that this summation convention is implied, unless explicitly stated other\nwise.\n(a) From the definition in Eq. (1.1.1), show that\nεijk εinm = δjnδkm - δjmδkn ,\n(1.1.4)\nwhere of course there is an implied sum over the i index in Eq. (1.1.4), but the\nindices j, k, n, and m are free.\n(b) Using Eqs. (1.1.3) and (1.1.4), show that for any vectors AB, B, and CB,\nAB × (BB × CB) = BB (BA · CB) - CB (BA · BB)\n(1.1.5)\n\n8.07 PROBLEM SET 1, FALL 2012\np. 2\n(c) Using Eqs.

(1.31), p. 11, is\n\nA i =\nRij Aj .\nj=1\nIf we use the convention that repeated indices are summed over, then this can be written\nas\n\nA i = Rij Aj .\n(1.2.1)\n(a) Show that the elements (Rij ) of the three-dimensional rotation matrix must satisfy\nthe constraint\nRij Rik = δjk\n(1.2.2)\nin order to preserve the length of AB for all AB. Matrices satisfying Eq. (1.2.2) are\ncalled orthogonal. Here δjk is the Kronecker delta (δjk is 1 if j = k and 0 otherwise),\nand we use the summation convention above.\n(b) Using the orthogonality constraint (1.2.2), show that\n\nAi = RjiA j .\n(1.2.3)\nNote that we can now show that RjiRki = δjk using this relation, in a manner similar\nto the procedure in (a) (you do not have to show this).\n(c) Using the chain rule for partial differentiation and the results of (b), show that if f\nis scalar function of Br ≡ (x1, x2, x3), then B\nr) transforms as a vector; i.e., show\n∇f(B\nthat if\n\nf( x1, x 2, x 3) = f(x1, x2, x3) ,\n(1.2.4)\nwhere xi = Rij xj , then\n∂f\n∂f\n= Rij\n.\n(1.2.5)\n∂x i\n∂xj\n\n8.07 PROBLEM SET 1, FALL 2012\np. 3\nPROBLEM 4: USE OF THE GRADIENT (10 points)\nGriffiths Problem 1.12 (p.15), Griffiths Problem 1.13 part (a) only (p.15).\nPROBLEM 5: THE DIRAC DELTA FUNCTION AND ∇2(1/4πr) (20 points)\nOne of the most used identities in this course is be the relation\nrˆ\nB\n-∇2\n= -B\n∇\n= ∇·\nB\n= δ3(r) = δ(x) δ(y) δ(z) .\n(1.5.1)\n∇·\n4πr\n4πr\n4πr2\nIt turns out of course (see Griffiths 1.5.1, p. 45) that\n-∇2\n4πr\nis zero everywhere except at the origin, and ill-defined there. To get a better feel for the\nfact that\n-∇2\n4πr\nis a delta function, let's look at a different function which approaches -(1/4πr) in some\nlimit, but which is well-behaved everywhere. The function is\nfa(r) = -\n√\n.\n(1.5.2)\n4π\n2 + a2\nr\nFor a nonzero, fa(r) is well-behaved everywhere, and\nlim fa(r) = -\n(1.5.3)\na→0\n4πr\n(a) Calculate ga(r) = ∇2fa(r) and show that it is also well behaved for all r.

Express the volume\ncharge density using a delta function in spherical coordinates. Repeat for a ring of\nradius R with charge Q lying in the xy plane.\n(b) In cartesian coordinates, we can write δ3(Br -Br') = δ(x -x')δ(y -y')δ(z -z'). How\nwould one express δ3(Br -Br') in cylindrical coordinates (s, φ, andz).\n(c) A charge λ per unit length is distributed uniformly over a cylindrical surface of radius\nb. Give the volume charge density using a delta function in cylindrical coordinates\nJ\n(d) What is ∇2 ln r in two dimensions? (Here r is the radial coordinate, r =\nx2 + y2.)\nPROBLEM 7: COROLLARIES OF THE FUNDAMENTAL INTEGRAL\nTHEOREMS (15 points)\nThis problem is closely related to Problem 1.60, p. 56 of Griffiths. You will find\nuseful hints there- but try without hints first!!. Show that:\n\nB\n(a)\n∇ψ d3x =\nψ dBa, where S is the surface bounding the volume V .

Either hand it in at the lecture, or by 6:00\npm in the 8.07 homework boxes.\nREADING ASSIGNMENT: Chapter 2 of Griffiths: Electrostatics.\nGRADING OF THIS PROBLEM SET: The problem set is worth 85 points plus\n20 points extra credit. It is therefore time to clarify the operational definition of\n\"extra credit\". We will keep track of the extra credit grades separately, and at the\nend of the course I will first assign provisional grades based solely on the regular\ncoursework. I will consult with Prof. Chen and Ahmet Demir, and we will try to\nmake sure that these grades are reasonable. Then I will add in the extra credit,\nallowing the grades to change upwards accordingly. Finally, we will look at each\nstudent's grades individually, and we might decide to give a higher grade to some\nstudents who are slightly below a borderline. Students whose grades have improved\nsignificantly during the term, and students whose average has been pushed down by\nsingle low grade, will be the ones most likely to be boosted.\nThe bottom line is that you should feel free to skip the extra credit problems,\nand you will still get an excellent grade in the course if you do well on the regular\nproblems. However, if you are the kind of student who really wants to get the\nmost out of the course, then I hope that you will find these extra credit problems\nchallenging, interesting, and educational. (As described in the solutions to Problem\nSet 1, the problem sets in the course will not be graded in full, but instead only\nselected problems will actually be graded. The extra credit problems will never be\namong the graded problems.)\nPROBLEM 1: THE LAPLACIAN AS THE ANTI-LUMPINESS OPERA\nTOR (15 points)\nIn this problem you will prove a relation that was stated in lecture. Le φ(fr) be any\nscalar function of position fr. We are interested in relating the value of φ at an arbitrary\npoint fr0 to the average value of φ on a sphere that is centered at fr0. While the point fr0\nis arbitrary, we can simpify our notation by choosing a coordinate system so that fr0 is\nthe origin f0. Then the relation to be proved can be written\n\nφ(f0) - φ (R) = -\nd3 x\n-\n∇2φ .\n(1.1)\n4π\nr<R\nr\nR\nHere φ(R) represents the average value of φ on the surface of a sphere of radius R, which\ncan be written explicitly as\n\n2π\nπ\nφ (R) =\nφ(R, θ, φ) sin θ dθ dφ.\n(1.2)\n4π\n\n8.07 PROBLEM SET 2, FALL 2012\np. 2\nThe integration in Eq. (1.1) is over the volume of a sphere of radius R, centered at the\norigin. The relation to lumpiness can be seen by thinking of φ as the density of a pudding.\nThe equation implies that if ∇2φ = 0, then the value of φ at the origin is the same as\nthe average value of its surroundings (no lumpiness). But if ∇2φ < 0, then the value of\nφ at the origin is higher than the average value of its surroundings (i.e., there is a lump).\n(a) Defining\ng(r) ≡\n-\n(1.3)\nr\nR\nfor compactness, use the divergence theorem to show that\n\nd3 x ∇·\nf\ng f\n= 0 .\n∇φ\n(1.4)\nr<R\n(b) Use index notation (i.e., f\ne\ni) to show that for arbitrary scalar functions g(fr)\n∇≡ ˆi∂\nand φ(fr)\n∇· (g\n) = f\n∇φ + g ∇\nf\n∇f φ\n∇g · f\n2φ .\n(1.5)\n(c) Use the identity in part (b) to rewrite the integrand of the integral of Eq. (1.4), and\nevaluate each term separately. We suggest that the integral of ∇f g · f∇φ be expressed\nin spherical polar coordinates. Show that the vanishing of the integral in Eq. (1.4),\nre-expressed in this way, implies Eq. (1.1).\nPROBLEM 2: CAPACITANCE OF A CYLINDRICAL CAPACITOR (10\npoints)\nA very long conducting cylinder (length e\nand radius a) carrying a total charge +q is sur\nrounded by a thin conducting cylindrical shell\n(length e and radius b) with total charge -q, as\nshown in cross section in the sketch.\n(a) Using Gauss's law, find an expression for the\nelectric field Ef(fr) at points a < r < b. Ne\nglect end effects due to the finite length of\nthe capacitor.\n(b) Using your expression for Ef from part (a),\nfind the potential difference ∆V between the\nouter shell and the inner cylinder.\n(c) Derive an expression for the capacitance of this capacitor in terms of the quantities\ngiven. What is the capacitance per unit length?\n(d) Let the gap d = b -a between the cylinders be small compared to the radii, a and\nb. Show that in this case your answer for part (c) reduces to that for a parallel plate\ncapacitor (see Griffiths Eq. (2.54) on p. 105).\n\n8.07 PROBLEM SET 2, FALL 2012\np. 3\nPROBLEM 3: THE ELECTRIC FIELD, POTENTIAL, AND ENERGY OF\nA UNIFORM SPHERE OF CHARGE (15 points)\n(a) A uniformly charged sphere of charge has radius R and total charge Q. Using Gauss's\nlaw, calculate the electric field Ef(fr) everywhere.\n(b) Using the electric field you calculated in part (a), find the electric potential V (fr)\neverywhere.\n(c) Using the expression\nW = 1\n2 0\nall space\n| fE|2 d3 x ,\n(3.1)\nfor the total work needed to assemble the charge configuration, calculate W using\nyour expressions above.\n(d) Using the expression\nW =\nρV d3 x ,\n(3.2)\nall space\ncalculate W again using your expressions above.\nPROBLEM 4: CALCULATING FORCES USING VIRTUAL WORK (10\npoints)\nUse \"virtual work\" to calculate the attractive force between conductors in the parallel\nplate capacitor (area A, separation d). That is, use conservation of energy to determine\nhow much work must be done to move one plate by an infinitesimal amount, and then\nuse the value of the work to determine the force. Do your virtual work computations in\ntwo ways:\n(a) keeping fixed the charges on the plates, and,\n(b) keeping a fixed the voltage between the plates.\nPROBLEM 5: MUTUAL CAPACITANCE (15 points)\nIn lecture we discussed relations of the form\nn\n\nQi =\nCij Vj ,\ni, j\n\n= 1, 2, . . ., n .\n(5.1)\nj=1\ngoverning the potentials and charges of n conductors (with the potential taken to be zero\nat spatial infinity).\n(a) Prove that Cij = Cji. [Hint: Consider how much energy is needed to start with the\nsystem uncharged, then add charge Qi to conductor i, and then add charge Qj to\n\n8.07 PROBLEM SET 2, FALL 2012\np. 4\nconductor j. Then consider starting again with the system uncharged, and perform\ning these operations in the opposite order. That is, add charge Qj to conductor j,\nand then Qi to conductor i. Then think about how to use your answers to prove the\ndesired result.]\n(b) Consider a two-conductor configuration. Calculate the conventional capacitance C\nin terms of C11, C12, C21, and C22.\n(c) Consider two concentric spherical conducting shells of radii a and b with a < b.\nCall the inner shell conductor 1, and the outer shell conductor 2. Calculate the\nmatrix of capacitances Cij and use your result from part (b) to infer the conventional\ncapacitance C. Compare your answer with Example 2.11 in Griffiths, p. 105.\nPROBLEM 6: SPACE CHARGE, VACUUM DIODES, AND THE CHILD\nLANGMUIR LAW (20 points)\nGriffiths Problem 2.48 (p. 107). Challenging! For part (e), you can solve the dif\nferential equation either by guessing a solution and showing that it works, or by finding\na first integral by the same method that is used in mechanics to go from Newton's 2nd\norder equation of motion to the first order equation for the conservation of mechanical\nenergy.\nPROBLEM 7: ∇2(1/r) IN THE LANGUAGE OF DISTRIBUTIONS (20\npoints extra credit)\nThis problem will have a longwinded pedagogical introduction, since it concerns an\napproach which was discussed in lecture, but is not discussed in the textbook.\nIn Problem 5 of Problem Set 1, you evaluated -∇2(1/4πr) by replacing 1/r by\n√\n√\n1/\nr2 + a . After calculating ga(r) ≡-∇2(1/4π\nr2 + a2), you showed that its integral\nover all space is 1, and that for any r = 0 it approaches 0 as a → 0. This exercise was\nintended to convey a useful intuition about δ-functions, and about the relation\n-∇2\n= δ3(fr) .\n(7.1)\n4πr\nHowever, from the standpoint of a mathematically rigorous treatment, there is a short\ncoming to this and all similar treatments of the δ-function as a limit of a sequence of\nfunctions. While the sequence of functions leads to reliable intuition, the precise math\nematical picture is complicated by the ordering of limits. That is, you showed in your\n\nproblem set solutions that\nga(r) d3x = 1 for any a > 0, and hence\nall space\nlim\nga(r) d3 x = 1 .\n(7.2)\na→0 all space\n\n8.07 PROBLEM SET 2, FALL 2012\np. 5\nHowever, if we had taken the limit first, we would have found\nif r = 0\nlim ga(r) =\n(7.3)\na→0\ninf if r = 0 ,\nand we showed in lecture that the integral of this function, defined as the area under\nthe curve, is in fact zero. So we cannot quite say that ga(r) approaches a δ-function as\na → 0. Instead, we have to keep in mind the slightly more complicated picture in which\nga(r) acts like a δ-function when a is very very small, and behaves exactly as a δ-function\nif we take the limit a → 0 after any integrations have been carried out.\nSince the integral of the function described in Eq. (7.3) vanishes, there is no normal\nfunction that behaves as a Dirac δ-function. Thus the δ-function is technically not a\nfunction, but rather what the mathematicians call a generalized function, or a distribution.\nIt is really the concept of integration that is being generalized, and a distribution is\nthe integrand of a generalized integral. Starting with functions of one variable, we can\nconsider an arbitrary function φ(x). Its integral,\ninf\nφ(x) dx ,\n(7.4)\n-inf\nmaps the function φ(x) into a single real number, the value of its integral. It is a linear\nmap, in the sense that\ninf\ninf\ninf\n[φ1(x) + λφ2(x)] dx =\nφ1(x) dx + λ\nφ2(x) dx ,\n(7.5)\n-inf\n-inf\n-inf\nwhere λ is a constant. A distribution defines a generalized integral, which is an arbitrary\nlinear map from the space of smooth \"test\" functions φ(x) to real numbers. These test\nfunctions are required not only to be smooth, but also to fall off rapidly at large values\nof |x|.* The distribution that corresponds to a δ-function is the map which takes the\nfunction φ(x) to φ(x0), its value at some particular point x0. While there is no function\nthat behaves as a Dirac δ-function, it is perfectly clear that this map from functions to\nreal numbers is well-defined. Thinking of this map as a generalization of integration, we\ncan write it as\nφ(x) δ(x - x0) dx ≡ φ(x0) .\n(7.6)\n* Various choices can be made for the precise restrictions on the space of test func\ntions. A frequently used choice is the space of Schwartz functions, which are infinitely\ndifferentiable, and which have the property that the function and all its derivatives fall\noff faster than any power at large |x|. The distributions associated with this definition of\nsmoothness are called tempered distributions.\n\n8.07 PROBLEM SET 2, FALL 2012\np. 6\nBut remember that the integral sign here does not describe the area under a curve; instead\nit denotes a linear map from the function φ(x) to a real number, and the symbol δ(x-x0)\nindicates the particular linear map which maps φ(x) to its value at x0, namely φ(x0).\nMathematically, Eq. (7.6) defines the δ-function, which is defined solely as a prescription\nfor a generalized type of integration.\nThe derivative of a distribution is defined so that generalized integration is consistent\nwith the usual procedure of integration by parts:\nd\ndφ(x)\nφ(x)\nδ(x -x0) dx ≡-\nδ(x -x0) dx ≡-φ'(x0) ,\n(7.7)\ndx\ndx\nwhere φ'(x) ≡dφ(x)/dx. Note that we do not include any boundary terms, as φ(x) is\nrequired to fall off at large |x| fast enough to cause any boundary terms to vanish.\nWe are now ready to evaluate ∇2(1/r) in the language of distributions. Note that\nin the language of functions ∇2(1/r) is ill-defined, because 1/r is not differentiable at\nr = 0. But we can promote 1/r to a distribution by defining it as a mapping from test\nfunctions φ(fr) to numbers, where the mapping is given by the (ordinary) integral\n1 d3 x .\n(7.8)\nφ(fr)\nNote that even though 1/r is singular at r = 0, this integral is perfectly well defined,\nsince in spherical polar coordinates we have\nd3 x = r dr sin θ dθ dφ .\n(7.9)\nr\nBy defining the derivative of a distribution by integration by parts, as in Eq. (7.7), we\ncan write the distribution corresponding to ∇2(1/r), which I will call F [φ(fr)] for future\nreference:\nφ(fr) ∇\nd3 x =\nφ(fr) ∂i∂i\nd3 x\n(7.10a)\nr\nr\n= -\n∂iφ(fr) ∂i\nd3 x\n(710b)\n=\n∇2φ(fr)\nd3 x ,\n(7.10c)\nr\nr\nr\nso\nF [φ(fr)] ≡\n∇2φ(fr)\nd3 x .\n(7.11)\nr\n\n8.07 PROBLEM SET 2, FALL 2012\np. 7\nNote that the square brackets used for the argument of F is a common notation for a\nfunctional, i.e., a function of a function. Here F maps the function φ(fr) to the number\ngiven by the (ordinary) integral on the right-hand side of Eq. (7.11).\nAT LAST: THE HOMEWORK PROBLEM:\n(a) Evaluate F[φ(fr)] (as defined by Eq. (7.11)) for an arbitrary smooth test function\nφ(fr) which falls off rapidly for large |fr|. Show that\nF[φ(fr)] = -4πφ(f0) .\n(7.12)\nSince\nφ(fr) δ3(fr) = φ(f0) ,\n(7.13)\nEq. (7.12) is equivalent to writing\n∇2\n= -4πδ3(fr)\n(7.14)\nin the sense of distributions, which is the result we seek. [Hint: Although Eq. (7.11)\nis the defining equation, there is nothing that prevents you from integrating by parts\nonce to retrieve the integral in the form of Eq. (7.10b). Write this in spherical polar\ncoordinates, and then try to evaluate it.]\n(b) Use the language of distributions to evaluate ∇2 ln r in two dimensions.

Griffiths felt (and I agree) that the answers\nto this problem are sufficiently subtle that he should give the answers in the statement\nof the problem. Your job, then, is to explain these answers.\n(c) (10 points extra credit) Note that Griffiths found the δ-function term in the expres\nsion for the electric field of a dipole by starting with an ill-defined expression (i.e.,\nVdip(r, θ) = p cos θ/(4πE0r2) is not differentiable at r = 0), then calculating a wrong\nanswer, and then noticing that the answer violated a general theorem. He then asked\nwhat could be changed in the answer to avoid claiming a result which is demonstrably\nfalse. He got the right answer, but one might hope to find a way to make everything\n\n8.07 PROBLEM SET 5 REVISED, FALL 2012\np. 4\nwell-defined from the start. The method of distributions, or generalized functions,\nis exactly that.\nTo define Vdip as a distribution, we define it in terms of what happens when we\nmultiply it by a test function φ(r) and then integrate over all space:\np cos θ\nFVdip[φ(r)] ≡\n\nφ(r)\n\nd3x .\n(5.1)\n4πε\n0r\n\nThe test function is required to be smooth, and to fall offrapidly at large |r|. Note\nthat the integral is well-defined in spite of the factor of 1/r2, since the singularity is\ncanceled by the measure d3x = r2 dr sin θ dθ dφ. The derivative ∂iVdip ≡∂Vdip/∂xi\nis defined in the sense of distributions by formally integrating by parts. That is, one\nmight naively differentiate by writing\np cos θ\nF∂iVdip[φ(r)]\n=\nφ(r)∂i\nd3x ,\n(5.2)\nnaively\n\n4πε0r\n\nbut this integral is ill-defined. The real definition in the sense of distributions is\ngiven by\np cos θ\nF∂iVdip[φ(r)] = -\n\n∂iφ(r)\n\nd3x .\n(5.3)\n4πε0r2\nBy definition there is no surface term associated with the integration by parts. One\ncan intuitively justify this by the assumption that φ(r) falls of rapidly with |r|, but\nin the logic of distribution theory, Eq. (5.3) is simply the definition of the derivative\nof the distribution Vdip.\nThe integral on the right-hand side of Eq. (5.3) is a well-defined, ordinary integral.\nThe goal is to show that this gives Griffith's expression (Eq. (3.106, p. 157)) for the\nelectric field of a dipole, δ-function term included. One way to do this is to separate\nthe integral into two pieces, r < ε and r > ε, where ε is a positive number which will\nin the end be taken to zero. Then\nF∂iVdip[φ(r)] =\n(1)\n(2)\nF∂V\nφ\ndip[ (r)] + F\ni\n∂iVdi [φ\n,\np\n(r)]\n(5.4)\nwhere\n(1)\nθ\nF∂V\n[φ(r)] = -\n\np cos\n∂iφ(r\ni\ndip\n)\nr>ε\n\n4πε0r2\n\nd3x\n(5.5)\n(2)\np cos θ\nF∂iVdip[φ(r)] = -\n\n∂φ(r)\n\nd3\ni\nx .\nr<ε\n4πε0r2\nLooking at\n(2)\nF∂V\n[φ(r)], one can see that it vanishes in the limit ε\nwrite\ni\ndip\n→0.

We\nalso used the facts that | sin θ| ≤1 and | cos θ| ≤1. Since we will evaluate Eq. (5.4)\nin the limit ε →0, we can forget about\n(2)\nF∂iVdip[φ(r)].\nSince the integral in\n(1)\nF∂iVdip[φ(r)] has a lower limit > 0, we can evaluate it by\nintegrating by parts.

In part (b), you are expected to use Eq. (5.89), from\nProblem 5.57, without proving it in any way. In part (c), where you are asked to find the\napproximate vector potential, you are expected to find it in the dipole approximation.\nPROBLEM 7:\nA DELTA FUNCTION IDENTITY AND ITS CONSE\nQUENCES (20 points plus 10 points extra credit):\nEssentially every E&M equation involving δ-functions can be derived from the identity\n\nrˆj\n( xj )\nδij -3ˆrirˆj\n4π\n∂i\n≡∂i\n=\n+\nδij δ3(jr) .\n(7.1)\nr2\nr3\nr3\nTo make sure the definitions are clear, I remind you that jr ≡xieˆi ≡xeˆx + yeˆy + zeˆz ,\nr ≡|jr|, ˆr ≡jr/r, ˆri ≡xi/r, and ∂i ≡∂/∂xi. (Despite the usefulness of this identity, I\nhave not seen it in the literature. If anyone has, please tell me (Alan Guth) where.)\n(a) (5 points) Show that the famous identity,\n\n∇\n= -4πδ3(jr) ,\n(7.2)\nr\nfollows immediately from Eq. (7.1). (Hint: recall that xj /r3 = -∂j (1/r).)\n(b) (5 points) Using this identity, show that the potential for an electric dipole,\n1 rˆ · pj\nVdip(jr) =\n,\n(7.3)\n4πE0 r2\ncan be differentiated straightforwardly to give the electric field of a dipole,\n1 3(pj · rˆ) ˆr -pj\nj\np δ3(j\n(7.4)\nEdip(jr) = -∇j Vdip =\n-\nj\nr) .\n4πE0\nr\n3E0\n\n8.07 PROBLEM SET 7, FALL 2012\np. 3\n(c) (5 points) Again using this identity, show that the vector potential for a magnetic\ndipole,\nμ m\nAdip(r) =\n× rˆ ,\n(7.5)\n4π\nr2\ncan be used to find immediately that the magnetic field of a magnetic dipole is given\nby\nμ\nr\nBdip(r) =\nA =\n0 3(m· ˆ) ˆr -m\n2μ\n∇×\n+\n0 m δ\n\n3(r) .\n(7.6)\n4π\nr3\n(d) (5 points) Demonstrate that the identity holds by first showing that it is valid for\nr = 0, and then verifying the δ-function by integrating over a small sphere of radius\nε about the origin. Use the identity of Problem 1.60 part (a), p. 56, to convert\n\n∂i\nr<ε\nrˆj\nr2\n\nd3x\n(7.7)\ninto a surface integral on a sphere of radius ε. (Here the integrand has an extra\nvector index j, but the identity in Problem 1.60(a) holds for any function T(r); if\nthe function happens to be the j'th component of a vector, the identity still applies.)\nEvaluate the surface integral to show that the δ-function term in Eq. (7.1) is correct.\n(e) (10 points extra credit) Prove the identity (7.1), using the mathematical definitions\nof distribution theory. The calculation will not be much different from that of part\n(d), but the justification needs to be phrased more carefully. In particular, math-\nematicians would criticize the calculation in part (d) by saying that the integral in\nEq. (7.7) was ill-defined from the beginning, since (rˆ\nj/r ) is not differentiable at\nr = 0.\nMathematicians give a rigorous meaning to the identity (7.1) by defining both sides\nas distributions, which means that they are defined by the result of multiplying them\nby an arbitrary test function φ(r) (which is assumed to be smooth and to fall off\nrapidly as r →inf) and then integrating both sides over all space. (The distribution\nis thus a mapping from the test function φ(r) to a number, the value of the integral.)\nIf the integrals obtained on each side of the equation are equal, then the identity\n(7.1) is valid -- i.e., the two sides of Eq. (7.1) are said to be equal in the sense of\ndistributions.* For the right-hand side (RHS),\nRHS =\n\nδ\nˆ\n4π\nφ(\nij\n3ˆrirj\nr)\n\n-\n+\nδ\n\nd3\nij δ3(r)\nx\nr3\n(7.8)\n=\n\nδ\nφ(r)\nij -3ˆrirˆj\n4π\nd3x +\nδ\nr3\nij φ(0) .\n* Note, however, that \"equal in the sense of distributions\" might not correspond com-\npletely to your intuitive sense of \"equal\". For example, a function of x that is equal to\n1 at x = 0 and zero everywhere else is equal in the sense of distributions to the function\nthat is zero everwhere.\n\n8.07 PROBLEM SET 7, FALL 2012\np. 4\nThe integral above is singular, but may be defined precisely by\n\nδij -3ˆrirˆj\n\nδij -3ˆr rˆ\nφ(r)\nd x ≡lim\nφ(r)\ni j d3x .\n(7.9)\nr3\nε→0\nr>ε\nr3\nIn this form the integral is well-defined, since the measure d3x = r2dr sin θ dθ dφ\ncancels two factors of r in the denominator, and the remaining factor of r is harmless\nbecause δij -3ˆrirˆj vanishes when integrated over angles.\nTo evaluate the left-hand side (LHS), integrate by parts:\nLHS =\n\nφ(r)∂i\nrˆj\n\nd3x\n(7.10a)\nr2\n= -\n\n∂iφ(r)\nrˆj\nd3x .\n(7.10b)\nr2\n\nNote that Eq. (7.10a) involves the same ill-defined derivative as Eq. (7.7), but the\nmathematicians give it unambiguous meaning by defining the derivative of a distri-\nbution by integration by parts: all the derivatives are applied to the test function\nφ(r). Thus the LHS is defined by Eq. (7.10b).\nTo manipulate Eq. (7.10b), we first write it as\nLHS = -lim\n\nrˆj\n∂\niφ(r)\n→\nε\nr>ε\n\nr\n\nd x .\n(7.11)\nThe restriction of the integral to r > ε makes no difference in the limit ε →0, since\nthe integrand behaves smoothly (recall that d3x = r2 dr sin θ dθ dφ). By writing it\nthis way, however, we can separate it into pieces which individually will not behave\nsmoothly as r →0. Specifically, we can integrate by parts:\nLHS = -lim\n\nrˆ\n(\nj\nrˆj\n∂i φ r)\nφ(r)∂i\nd3x .\n(7.12)\nε→0\nr>ε\n\nr\n\n-\n\nr\n\nHere's where you take over. Show that the second term in the integrand reproduces\nEq. (7.9), and that the first term can be converted to a surface integral that evaluates\nto (4π/3)δij φ(r).\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n8.07 Electromagnetism II\nFall 2012\n\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

I recommend that you consult the \"Delta\nFunctions\" section of the Quiz 2 Formula Sheet to remind yourself of the key definitions.\n(a) The Heaviside step function is defined by\nif\n\nx > 0\nθ(x) =\n(8.1)\nif x < 0 ,\nwhere θ(0) is often defined to be . If we think of θ(x) as a distribution, an object\nthat is defined only by the result of multiplying by a test function φ(x) and then\nintegrating, the value of θ(0) is irrelevant. Treating θ(x) as a distribution, prove the\nidentity\ndθ(x) = δ(x) .\n(8.2)\ndx\nThat is, assume that φ(x) is an arbitrary smooth test function which falls off rapidly\nas |x| →inf. (The mathematicians often restrict φ(x) to belong to the space of\nSchwartz functions, which are infinitely differentiable, and which have the property\nthat the function and all its derivatives fall off faster than any power at large |x|.\nHere we do not expect any rigorous mathematical analysis, but instead we expect\nyou to simply trust the standard manipulations of calculus.) Furthermore, recall\nthat if Ψ(x) is a distribution defined in terms of the integral\ninf\nφ(x)Ψ(x) dx ,\n-inf\nthen its derivative is defined by\n\ninf\ninf\ndΨ(x)\ndφ(x)\nφ(x)\ndx ≡-\nΨ(x) dx .\n(8.3)\n-inf\ndx\ndx\n-inf\nWith these definitions, show that\n\ninf\ninf\ndθ(x)\nφ(x)\ndx =\nφ(x)δ(x) dx .\n(8.4)\ndx\n-inf\n-inf\n\n8.07 PROBLEM SET 9, FALL 2012\np. 3\n(Hint: Once you figure out what you are really being asked to prove, it takes only\none or two lines.)\n(b) Show that\nθn(x) = θ(x) ,\n(8.5)\nin the sense of distributions, for any positive integer n. (That is, show that if each\nside of the above equation is multiplied by an arbitrary smooth test function φ(x),\nand then integrated from -inf to inf, the two results are always equal.)\n(c) The derivative of a distribution is always well-defined, by Eq. (8.3). Thus we might\nexpect that we could differentiate Eq. (8.5), obtaining\n?\nnθn-1(x)δ(x) = δ(x) .\n(8.6)\nShow that when combined with Eq. (8.5), Eq. (8.6) can lead to a contradiction. The\nbottom line is that while the derivative of a distribution is always well-defined, the\nproduct of two distributions, such θ(x)δ(x) or δ2(x), is generally not well-defined.\n(δ3(r ) ≡ δ(x)δ(y)δ(z) is however okay, because the arguments of the delta functions\nare independent coordinates -- δ3(r ) can be thought of as a single δ-function defined\nas a distribution for functions on three-dimensional space.) What is\nd θn(x) ?\ndx\n(d) Show that for any smooth function f(x),\nf(x)δ(x - x0) = f(x0)δ(x - x0) ,\n(8.7)\nin the sense of distributions.\n(e) If we differentiate the above identity, we find\ndf(x)\ndδ(x - x0)\ndδ(x - x0)\nδ(x - x0) + f(x)\n= f(x0)\n.\n(8.8)\ndx\ndx\ndx\nThe two sides do not look like they are equal, but show that they are.\n(f) Evaluate\ninf\nG[φ(x)] ≡\nφ(x)δ(x 2 - a 2) dx ,\n(8.9)\n-inf\nwhere a is a positive constant.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n8.07 Electromagnetism II\nFall 2012\n\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

Explicit formulas\nfor Si and Tij are given on p. 13 of the formula sheets. The goal of this problem is to\nextend the result to include the possibility that magnetic charges also exist, as described\nby the extended version of Maxwell's equations shown in the formula sheets on p. 11. To\nsimplify the algebra, however, we will consider the case where ONLY magnetic charge\ndensity ρm and magnetic current density Jm are present, but ρe = Je = 0.\n(a) (5 points) If the magnetic charges are discrete, then the rate of change of the total\nmechanical momentum in the region is just the sum of the forces acting on the\nmagnetic monopoles:\ndPmech,i =\n\n(n)\nF\nq n)\ni\n=\n\n(\nm\n\nB -\n\nv × E\n,\ndt\nc2\nn\nn\n\n(2.2)\ni\nwhere\n(n)\nFi\nis the i'th component of the force on the n'th monopole, and\n(n)\nqm\nis the\nmagnetic charge of the n'th monopole.

(3.2).)\n(c) (5 points) Find also the magnetic field B that the observer will measure at the same\ntime.\nPROBLEM 4: A ROTATING MAGNETIC DIPOLE (20 points)\nA rotating magnetic dipole can be thought of as the su-\nperposition of two oscillating magnetic dipoles, one along the\nx axis, and the other along the y axis (see figure at the right),\nwith the latter out of phase by 90*:\nm= m0[cos(ωt) ˆx + sin(ωt) ˆy] .\n(4.1)\n(a) (10 points) Suppose that an observer is located along the z axis, at (0, 0, z0). Find\nthe electric and magnetic fields that she measures, as a function of time. (Remember\nthat the electric and magnetic fields are vectors, not numbers.)\n(b) (5 points) Find the Poynting vector measured by the observer in part (a), as a\nfunction of time, and also find the time-averaged value of the Poynting vector.\n(c) (5 points) Now suppose that the observer was located along the x axis, at (x0, 0, 0).\nFind the electric and magnetic fields that she would measure at this point, as a\nfunction of time.\n\nPROBLEM 5: SHORT QUESTIONS (25 points)\n(a) (5 points) Suppose I invented a function VAlan(r, t), and defined the Alan gauge as\nthe gauge for which V (r, t) = VAlan(r, t) for all r and all t. Is it always possible to\nwrite the electromagnetic potentials in Alan gauge? If so, give a recipe for finding\nthe gauge function Λ that takes one to Alan gauge, where the gauge transformation\nis written as\n∂Λ\nA′ = A + ∇Λ ,\nV ′ = V -\n.\n(5.1)\n∂t\nIf not, give an argument why not.\n(b) (5 points) Suppose I invented a vector function\nAAlan(r, t), and defined the\nvector-Alan gauge as the gauge for which A(\n\nr, t) = AAlan(r, t) for all r and all\nt. Is it always possible to write the electromagnetic potentials in vector-Alan gauge?\nIf so, give a recipe for finding the gauge function Λ that takes one to Alan gauge,\nand if not, give an argument why.\n(c) (7 points) The potential energy function for an ideal (static) electric quadrupole is\ngiven by\nrˆi\nV (r) =\nj\nQij\n,\n(5.2)\n8πε0\nr3\nwhere Qij is the quadrupole moment tensor, which is traceless and symmetric. Use\nPoisson's equation to find the charge density ρ(r) for an ideal quadrupole. Your\nanswer should be expressed in terms of Qij, and some kind of derivative of a delta\nfunction. (Hint: Start by using the identity\nδij -3ˆrirˆj\n4π\n-∂i∂j\n=\n+\nδ\nij δ (r)\n(5.3)\nr\nr3\nfrom the formula sheet to express rˆirˆj/r3 in terms of other quantities.)\n(d) (8 points) Accelerating charges normally radiate, but that is not always the case.\nConsider a sphere with a total charge Q uniformly spread on its surface, with a\nradius R(t) which pulsates:\nR(t) = R0 + R1 sin ωt ,\n(5.4)\nwhere 0 < R1 < R0, so R(t) is always positive. Show that this system does not\nradiate, even though the charges are accelerating.\n(Hint: take advantage of the\nsymmetry of the system to write down an exact solution to Maxwell's equations.)\nrˆ\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n8.07 Electromagnetism II\nFall 2012\n\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

The second image charge, combined\nwith the original charge but ignoring the first image charge, produces a potential\nthat is zero on the y = 0 plane, but the potential varies with y on the x = 0 plane.\nThe final image charge fixes these remaining problems. For any point on the y-z\nplane (the x = 0 plane) the original charge and q1 pair to give zero potential, and\nsimilarly q2 and q3 pair to give zero potential. For points on the x-z plane (where\ny = 0), the original charge and q2 give canceling potentials, as do q1 and q3.\nHaving found the image charges, we can write the force as\nF = Fq1 + Fq2 + Fq3\nwhere Fqi is defined as the force of charge qi on charge q.

The moral:\nPLEASE REVIEW IMAGE CHARGES!\nPROBLEM 2: ELECTRIC FIELDS IN A CYLINDRICAL GEOMETRY (20\npoints)\nA very long cylindrical object consists of an inner cylinder of radius a, which has a\nuniform charge density ρ, and a concentric thin cylinder, of radius b, which has an equal\nbut opposite total charge, uniformly distributed on the surface.\n(a) (7 points) Calculate the electric field everywhere.\n(b) (6 points) Calculate the electric potential everywhere, taking V = 0 on the outer\ncylinder.\n(c) (7 points) Calculate the electrostatic energy per unit length of the object.\n\n8.07 QUIZ 1 SOLUTIONS, FALL 2012\np. 3\nPROBLEM 2 SOLUTION:\n(a) This problem has enough symmetry to allow a solution by Gauss's law. In particular,\nsymmetry considerations imply that the electric field will point radially outward, and\nwill have a magnitude that depends only on the distance from the axis. Following\nGriffiths, we use s for the distance from the z-axis, and sˆ for a unit vector pointing\nradially outward from the axis, and of course we choose the z-axis to be the axis of\nthe cylindrical object. Then\nE = E(s) ˆs .\n(2.1)\nTo evaluate E(s), we apply Gauss's law to a Gaussian cylinder of length l, concentric\nwith the z-axis. Then\n\nQ\nE · da =\nenc = 2πslE(s) .\n(2.2)\nε0\nFor s < a, the Gaussian cylinder is filled with charge density ρ, so\nQenc = πs2\nρs\nlρ\n=⇒\nE(s) =\n.\n(2.3)\n2ε0\nFor a < s < b the enclosed charge is\nQenc = πa2\nρa2\nlρ\n=⇒\nE(s) =\n.\n(2.4)\n2ε0s\nFinally, for s > b the enclosed charge is zero, so E(s) = 0. Putting this together,\nρ\ns sˆ\nif s < a\n\na2\nE =\nsˆ\nif a < s < b\n(2.5)\n2ε0\n\ns\nif s > a .\n(b) To find the potential from the electric field, we can use\nr\n\nV (r) = V (r 0) -\n\nE(\n\nr ′) d\nr 0\n· l′\n(2.6)\nfrom the formula sheet.

To find the magnetic moment of sphere we can divide\nthe sphere into infinitesimal charges. Using spherical polar coordinates, we can take\ndq = ρ dτ = ρ r2 dr sin θ dθ dφ, with the contribution to the dipole moment given by\ndm = 1r\n× J dτ. One method would be to write down the volume integral directly,\nusing J = ρv = ρω ×r. We can, however, integrate over φ before we start, so we are\nbreaking the sphere into rings, where a given ring is indicated by its coordinates r\nand θ, and its size dr and dθ. The volume of each ring is dτ = 2πr2 dr sin θ dθ. The\ncurrent dI in the ring is given by dq/T, where T = 2π/ω is the period, so\ndq\nωρdτ\ndI =\n=\n= ωρr2 dr sin θ dθ .\n(1.2)\nT\n2π\n\n8.07 QUIZ 2 SOLUTIONS, FALL 2012\np. 2\nThe magnetic dipole moment of each ring is then given by\ndmring =\n\nr × J dτ =\ndI\n\nr ×\ndl= dI(πr2 sin2 θ) ˆz .\n(1.3)\nring\nring\nThe total magnetic dipole moment is then\nm=\n\nωρr2 sin θ (πr2 sin2 θ) dr dθ zˆ\n= πωρ\nR\nπ\nr4 dr\n\n(1\n-cos2 θ) sinθ dθ zˆ\nQ\nR5 4\n= πω 4\n=\nQωR2 z .\nˆ\n(1.4)\nπR3 5 3\n(b) The vector potential in dipole approximation is,\nμ0 m× r\nμ0 |msi\nA =\n=\n4π\nr3\n|\nn θ φˆ\nμ\n=\n0 QωR2 sin θ φ .\nˆ\n(1.5)\n4π\nr2\n4π\nr2\n(c) To calculate the exact vector potential inside the sphere, we split the sphere into\nshells.\nLet r′ be the integration variable and the radius of a shell, moreover let\ndr′ denote the thickness of the shell. Then we can use the results of Example 5.11\n(pp. 236-37) in Griffiths, if we replace σ by its value for this case. The value of σ is\nfound equating charges\nσ(4πr′2\nQ\n) = 4\n(4πr′2)dr′\n(1.6)\nπR3\nand therefore we must replace\nQ\nσ →\ndr .\n′\nπR3\nMaking this replacement in Griffiths' Eq.

If I defined a Guth-dot product by\n\nA\nA\nA · B\n≡|AA||BA| sin θ ,\nGuth\nand hired a really good advertising agency, could my product (note the\npun!) compete?\nTentative answer: Maybe a really good advertising agency can do anything, but\nI would have a serious marketing problem. My dot product would not be\ndistributive. In fact, one can show that if AA · BA obeys rotational invariance\nand the distributive law, then\nA\nA\nA · B = const|AA||BA| cos θ .\nWe'll come back to this later.\n\n8.07 LECTURE NOTES 1, FALL 2012\np. 3\nCross product of two vectors:\nAA × BA ≡|AA||BA| sin θ ˆn ,\nwhere ˆn is a unit vector perpendicular to AA and perpendicular to BA. The choice\nof the two (opposite) directions that are perpendicular to both AA and BA is\ndetermined by the right-hand rule:\n(Source: Modified from chortle.ccsu.edu/vectorlessons/vch12/rightHandRule.gif.)\nProperties:\nRotational invariance: If both vectors are rotated by the same rotation R, then\nthe result of the cross product is also rotated by R.\nA\nAnticommutative: A × BA = -BA × AA.\nDistributive: AA × (BA + CA) = AA × BA + AA × CA.\nScalar multiplication: (aAA) × BA = a(AA × BA).\nQuery: Why sin θ???\nAnswer: Again, the function of θ is required for rotational invariance and dis\ntributivity. If these two properties hold, then one can show that\nAA × BA = const|AA||BA| sin θ ˆn .\nCOMPONENT FORM:\nAA = Axeˆx + Ayeˆy + Az eˆz ,\nwhere ˆex is a unit vector in the direction of the positive x-axis.

But then the distributive law implies\nthat\neˆx · eˆy + ˆex · (-eˆy ) = ˆex · (ˆey + (-eˆy )) = ˆex · A0 = 0 .\nSimilarly the dot product of any two distinct basis vectors must vanish,\nso\nAA · BA = const (AxBx + Ay By + Az Bz) .\nThis had better be equivalent to const|AA||BA| cos θ, but we can see it\nexplicitly by using the rotational invariance to orient AA along the pos\nitive x-axis, so Ax = |AA|, and Ay = Az = 0. Then the above formula\nA\nA\ngives A · B = const AxBx, but Bx = |BA| cos θ, where θ is the angle\nbetween BA and the x-axis, but that is also the angle between BA and\nAA.\n\n8.07 LECTURE NOTES 1, FALL 2012\np. 5\nVector cross product:\nAA × BA = (Axeˆx + Ay eˆy + Az eˆz ) × (Bxeˆx + By eˆy + Bzeˆz ) ,\nwhere\neˆx × eˆx = ˆey × eˆy = ˆez × eˆz = 0 ,\nand\neˆx × eˆy = ˆez , and cyclic permutations,\neˆy × eˆz = -eˆz , and cyclic permutations.\nExpanding,\nAA × BA = (Ax\n)ˆ + (Ay\n)ˆ + (Az\n)ˆ\nBy - AyBx\nBz - Az\nez\nBy\nBx - Ax\nex\nBz ey .\nEquivalently, one can write\n\nˆex\nˆey\nˆez\nAA × AB = det Ax\nAy\nAz .\nBx\nBy\nBz\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n8.07 Electromagnetism II\nFall 2012\n\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

      "content": "MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY\nPhysics Department\nPhysics 8.07: Electromagnetism II\nSeptember 7, 2012\nProf. Alan Guth\nLECTURE NOTES 2\nROTATIONS IN INDEX NOTATION\nThese notes will be an elaboration of a topic that I discussed very hastily at the\nend of the lecture of Friday, September 7, 2012. How does one describe the rotation of a\nvector in index notation?\nRotations can be described in an active sense, or a passive sense, where active refers\nto rotating the object being described, while passive refers to rotating the coordinate\nsystem. I have always found it easier to visualize an active rotation, probably because\nit is easier to imagine an object rotating than it is to imagine one's own head spinning.\nEspecially when one tries to think about successive rotations about different axes, the\nactive description seems much easier to visualize. So here I will describe the rotations as\nactive.\n(I have to admit, however, that the idea of a passive rotation is easier to rigorously\ndefine. If you rotate the coordinate system, you don't need to say anything about the\nobject. If we are rotating the object, however, we have to imagine that we can cause the\nobject to rotate without affecting it in any other way. For a rigid object, like a block of\nwood, this sounds easy, as long as one does not care about microscopic vibrations. But\nif we had to rotate a stream of water falling from a faucet, it would be hard to figure out\nhow to do it. So, if anybody asks what we are really talking about, it is probably best\nto say that we are rotating the coordinate system. But I still find it most convenient\nto describe it actively, in terms of what happens to the object. The counterclockwise\nrotation of an object by an angle φ about the z-axis corresponds to a clockwise rotation\nof the coordinate system by the same amount.)\nSo, as an example, let us consider what happens to a vector if we rotate it counter\nclockwise by an angle φ about the z-axis. We consider an arbitrary vector A, which can\nbe expanded in unit vectors as\nAA = Aj eˆj .\n(2.1)\nWe let Aj denote the result of rotating A as described above. If A is expanded in basis\nvectors as in Eq. (2.1), then Aj can be expressed by using the same expansion coefficients\nAj , but with rotated basis vectors. That is, we can write\nj\nAAj = Aj eˆj ,\n(2.2)\nj\nwhere ˆej is the result of rotating ˆej counterclockwise by an angle φ about the z-axis. The\nj\nvectors ˆej can be expressed in terms of the basis vectors ˆej by drawing a diagram:\n\n8.07 LECTURE NOTES 2, FALL 2012\np. 2\nOne can read from the diagram that\neˆj\nx = ˆex cos φ + ˆey sin φ\njeˆ = -eˆx sin φ + ˆey cos φ\n(2.3)\ny\neˆj = ˆ .\nz\nez\nWe can rewrite the above equation by defining a matrix Rij , writing\njeˆ = ˆei Rij ,\n(2.4)\nj\nwhere in this case we call the rotation matrix Rz(φ), with\nj=1\nj=2\nj=3\n\ni=1\ncos φ - sin φ\n\n=\ni=2 sin φ\ncos φ\n0 .\n(2.5)\nRz(φ)ij\n\ni=3\nWhen Rij is written as a matrix, the first index (in this case i) labels the rows, and the\nsecond index (j in this case) labels the columns. By substituting Eq. (2.4) into Eq. (2.2),\nwe find\nAAj = Aj eˆi Rij ,\nor, by reordering the factors,\nAAj = (Rij Aj ) ˆei .\n(2.6)\nThe components Aj of the vector AAj are defined by\ni\nAAj = Aj\nieˆi ,\n(2.7)\nso by comparing Eq. (2.6) with Eq. (2.7), we see that\nAj\ni = Rij Aj ,\n(2.8)\n\n8.07 LECTURE NOTES 2, FALL 2012\np. 3\nwhere of course j is summed from 1 to 3, since it is a repeated index.\nNote that if the repeated indices are adjacent, as in Eq. (2.8), and if the number of\nindices on any one factor is not larger than two, then the index notation is just another\nway of writing matrix multiplication. That is, Eq. (2.8) could also be written as an\nexplicit matrix equation,\n\nAj\n\nR11\nR12\nR13 A1\n\nAj = R21\nR22\nR23 A2 ,\n(2.9)\n\nAj\nR31\nR32\nR33\nA3\nwhere the rules for matrix multiplication are equivalent to the sum over j.\nAs an aside,* I mention that it is not difficult to generalize Eq. (2.5) to describe a\nrotation about the direction of ˆn, where ˆn is an arbitrary unit vector. Eq. (2.5) describes\nrotations for ˆni = δi3, so we can try to rewrite Eq. (2.5) in terms of ˆn. If we start with\nthe matrix elements on the diagonal, we can get those right by writing\nRz (φ)ij = δij cos φ + ˆninˆj (1 - cos φ) + off-diagonal terms.\nThe off-diagonal elements are not so obvious. We want R21 = -R12 = sin φ, while the\nother off-diagonal terms should vanish. With a little thought, we see that we can build\nsuch an expression out of ˆn and the Levi-Civita symbol:\nR(ˆn, φ)ij = δij cos φ + ˆninˆj (1 - cos φ) - εijk nˆk sin φ .\n(2.10)\nBy inspection, we can see that Eq. (2.10) agrees with Eq. (2.5) for the special case ˆn = ˆez .\nBut any other case is just a rotation of this case. If we knew just a little more about\nrotational invariance than we are going to include in this course, we would be able to\nconclude that both sides of Eq. (2.10) behave the same way under rotations; that is,\nthey behave as tensors. Thus, if the equation is valid for the coordinate system in which\nthe rotation axis is the z-axis, then it is also valid in any rotated system, where ˆn is an\narbitrary unit vector.\n* An \"aside\" means that if you have trouble following this part, you can safely ignore\nit. It will not be needed for the rest of the course, and will not appear on any exams.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n8.07 Electromagnetism II\nFall 2012\n\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

      "content": "MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY\nPhysics Department\nPhysics 8.07: Electromagnetism II\nSeptember 21, 2012\nProf. Alan Guth\nLECTURE NOTES 4\nCONDUCTORS: SURFACE FORCES AND CAPACITANCE\nThese notes are an addendum to Lecture 7, Wednesday September 19, 2012. The\nnotes will not repeat what I said in class, but rather will explain two topics that I did not\nhave time to discuss in class: surface forces in conductors, and capacitance. The material\nin these notes will complete our class discussion of Chapter 2 of Griffiths, and it should\nbe useful to you in completing Problem Set 2.\nSURFACE FORCES COMPUTED USING VIRTUAL WORK:\nThe method of virtual work is simply the use of conservation of energy to determine\na force -- in this case, the force on the surface of a conductor. The work is virtual in\nthe sense that the entire system is static, so no work is actually done. Instead one asks\nhow much the energy of a system would change if the surface were moved an infinitesimal\namount, and this change in energy is then used to compute the force.\nTo illustrate the method, consider a solid ball of\nconductor with radius R, and charge Q. The charge\nwill flow to the surface, and by spherical symmetry the\ncharge must distribute itself uniformly on the sphere,\nwith surface charge density\nQ\nσ =\n.\n(4.1)\n4πR2\nOur goal is to calculate the force on the surface. Since\nthe forces depend only on the charges, the answer we\nget will hold for any spherical shell of charge, whether\na conductor is involved or not.\nTo calculate the total electrostatic energy of this configuration, note that Gauss's\nlaw implies\nE =\n\nQ\n\nrˆ\nfor r > R\n4πε0r2\n(4.2)\nfor r < R .\nTaking V = 0 at\nwe\n\ninf, for r > R\nhave\nV (r) = -\nr\nE · dl\ninf\n(4.3)\ninf\n= +\n\nQ\nE · dl= 4πε0\ninfdr\nQ\n=\n.\nr2\nr\nr\n4πε0r\n\n8.07 LECTURE NOTES 4, FALL 2012\np. 2\nThe potential on the surface is therefore Q/(4πε0R, and the potential inside the sphere\nis constant, with this value:\nV (r) = V (R) -\nr\nQ\nE dl= V (R) =\n,\n(4.4)\nR\n·\n4πε0R\nsince E = 0 inside the sphere. The total electrostatic energy can be found from\nQ\nW =\n\nρV d3\nx =\nV (R)\nρd3x =\nV (R)Q =\n.\n(4.5)\n\n8πε0R\nNow we can apply the method of virtual work. Consider a element of surface with\narea da. By spherical symmetry the force on it will be proportional to rˆ, and it must also\nbe proportional to da, since dq = σ da. So we can write the force on the surface element\nas\ndF = P da r ,\nˆ\n(4.6)\nwhere we have called the constant of proportionality P, because it is a force per area,\nalso known as a pressure. Now imagine that the sphere is allowed to expand to radius\nR + dR. The surface element will undergo a displacement rˆdR, so the mechanical work\nthe electric field does on it is\ndWmech = dF · (ˆr dR) = P da dR .\n(4.7)\nIntegrating over the surface, the total mechanical work done is\ndWmech = P dR\n\nda = 4πR2P dR .\n(4.8)\nEven though we have integrated, I am still calling the work dWmech, since it is an in-\nfinitesimal quantity proportional to dR. From Eq. (4.5), the change in the total potential\nenergy is given by\ndW\nQ2\ndW =\ndR = -\ndR .\n(4.9)\ndR\n8πε0R2\nBy conservation of energy, this must equal the negative of the amount of mechanical work\ndone. So\nQ2\n-\ndR =\nπR\nd\n0R2\n-4\n2P\nR ,\n(4.10)\n8πε\nand then\nQ2\n1 σ2\nP =\n=\n=\n\nσ E\n,\n(4.11)\n2(4\n|\nout\nπ)2ε0R4\n2 ε0\n|\n\n8.07 LECTURE NOTES 4, FALL 2012\np. 3\nwhere Eout = (σ/ε0)ˆr is the electric field just outside the surface.\nEq. (4.11) implies that the surface charge density σ experiences a force equivalent to\nan electric field 1 Eout\n, which is the average of the field outside and the vanishing electric\nfield inside.\nThe factor of 1\n2 in the force law is easy to understand from a microscopic model\nof the charge distribution. While the approximation of an idealized conductor implies a\nsurface charge layer of zero thickness, the idealization breaks down on the scale of atomic\ndimensions, so we expect that the real charge layer will have some nonzero thickness.\nIf we model the charge density as being uniform over this thickness, the situation is\ndescribed in the following diagram:\nGauss's law implies that the electric field at any point is proportional to the enclosed\ncharge, so the electric field varies linearly with distance, as shown. (We are treating the\nsurface as if it is a plane, since the thickness of the surface charge layer is far smaller\nthan R.) Thus, the average piece of charge in the surface experiences an electric field\nthat is midway between the value outside and the vanishing value inside, as we found\nby the method of virtual work. The description here is based on the assumption that\nthe charge density is uniform within the surface layer, but in fact the answer does not\ndepend on this simplification. No matter how the charge density is distributed in space,\nwe can always divide the thin layer into N thinner layers, each containing a fraction 1/N\nof σ. We can think about the limit N →inf. Gauss's law implies that the n'th layer\nwill experience the electric field of the first n -1 layers, no matter how the layers are\ndistributed in space. Thus, the total force is independent of how the charge density is\ndistributed in space, as long as we can assume that the thickness is small compared to\nR, so that the planar geometry is a valid approximation.\n\n8.07 LECTURE NOTES 4, FALL 2012\np. 4\nCAPACITANCE:\nTo describe capacitance in the most general possible context, we consider a system\nof N isolated conductors, with arbitrary shape and position:\nEach conductor is an equipotential, so we can let Vi be the potential of the i'th conductor,\ndefining the potential at |r| = infas zero.\nIf we specify the charge Qi on the i'th conductor, for each i, and if we know the\ngeometry of the conductors, we can in principle calculate the electric field everywhere.\nThe equations would be\n∇×\n\nE = 0\n(4.12)\noutside the conductors, and on the boundaries of each conductor\nσ\n\nE\n=\nn ,\nˆ\nE = 0 ,\n(4.13)\n⊥\nε0\n∥\nwhere E\nis the normal contribution of the electric field, E is the tangential contribution,\n⊥\n∥\nand nˆ is a unit outward normal vector to the surface. The total charges on each conductor\ni would be specified by\n\nσ da = Qi .\n(4.14)\nSi\nThe charges on each conductor will distribute themselves so that the field inside the\nconductor is zero, and we will prove later that this condition determines the distribution\nof charge uniquely. Thus, the potential on each conductor can be calculated, once all the\nQi are specified.\nSuppose we put a charge Q1 on conductor 1.\nThe net charges on all the other\nconductors will remain zero, but nonetheless a surface charge density will be induced\non the surfaces of each conductor, so that E inside each conductor will remain 0. If\nwe doubled the charge on conductor 1, the linearity of the equations of electrostatics\ntells us that the electric field everywhere would double, and hence the potential on each\nconductor would double. The surface charge densities would also double.\nThe linearity of the equations also implies that if we put charges on two conductors,\nthe electric field will be just the vector sum of the fields that would have been created by\nQ1 and Q2 separately. In general, then, the electric fields and hence also the potentials\nare linear in the charges Qi. Thus we can write\nVi =\n\nPijQj ,\n(4.15)\nj\n\n8.07 LECTURE NOTES 4, FALL 2012\np. 5\nwhere the constants Pij are determined by the geometry of the conductors. This matrix\ncan be inverted, so we can write\nQi =\n\nCijVj ,\n(4.16)\nj\nwhere as a matrix,\nC = P -1 , or equivalently\n\nCijPjk = δik .\n(4.17)\nj\nCij is called the capacitance matrix, while Pij is called either the elastance matrix, or\nsimply the reciprocal capacitance matrix. In my experience the word \"elastance\" is seldom\nused.\nThe most commonly discussed situation involves just\ntwo conductors, with charges that are equal in magnitude\nbut opposite in sign. Here V is used to denote the poten-\ntial difference between the two conductors. This pair of\nconductors is called a capacitor. In this case we define the\ncapacitance C by\nQ = CV .\n(4.18)\nNote that the charges for this case are related simply to the notation of the general case,\nwith Q1 = Q and Q2 = -Q, but the potential V is related in a more complicated way,\nV = V1 -V2. Thus the relation between C and the matrix Cij is nontrivial -- you will\ncalculate it in Problem 5 of Problem Set 2.\nThe unit of capacitance is a coulomb/volt, which is defined to be a farad.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n8.07 Electromagnetism II\nFall 2012\n\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

Here I will start it from the beginning, for completeness.\nThe problem comes from J.D. Jackson, Classical Electrodynamics, 3rd Edition, Problem\n3.2, p. 135.\nThe problem: Suppose that a spherical surface of radius R has a surface charge\ndensity σ0 =\nQ\n4πR2 uniformly distributed over its surface except for a spherical cap on the\nnorth pole, defined by the cone θ = α. Find the potential V (r) everywhere.\nWe choose a coordinate system with the center of the sphere at the origin, and the\nnorth pole (with its cap) along the positive z-axis. The problem then has azimuthal\nsymmetry, which brings it within the context discussed in Griffiths. If we start with the\nmore general formalism, however, just to show how it works, we can initially write the\nmost general solution to Laplace's equation as\ninf\n( ) =\n(\n) =\n\n( )\n(l)\nV r\nV r, θ, φ\nRlr Ci1...i ni . . . ni ,\nlˆ 1\nˆ l\n(7.1)\nl=0\nwhere\n(l)\nCi1...i is a traceless symmetric tensor, n\nl\nˆ is a unit vector in the direction of (θ, φ),\nand i1 through ilare repeated Cartesian indices which are summed from 1 to 3. The\nradial functions Rl(r) are constrained by Laplace's equation to take the form\nB\nRl(\nl\nr) = A\nl\nlr +\n.\n(7.2)\nrl+1\nFor the case of azimuthal symmetry, we insist that\n(l)\nCi1...i be invariant under rotations\nabout the z-axis.\nWe have not proven it, but the mos\nlt general such tensor can be\nconstructed by starting with zˆ, the only unit vector that is invariant under rotations\nabout the z-axis.\nOne can then construct the product zˆi1 . . . zˆil, and then take the\ntraceless symmetric part of this product. Using curly brackets { } to denote \"the traceless\nsymmetric part of,\" we have\n(l)\nCi1...i nˆi1 . . . nˆi\nl\nl= const { zˆi1 . . . zˆil} nˆi1 . . . nˆil∝Pl(cos θ) ,\n(7.3)\nwhere Pl(cos θ) is the standard Legendre polynomial. Absorbing the constants of pro-\nportionality into the constants Aland Bl, we can write\ninf\nV (r, θ, φ) =\n\nRl(r) Pl(cos θ) .\n(7.4)\nl=0\n\n8.07 LECTURE NOTES 7, FALL 2012\np. 2\nFor this problem there is a surface charge density at r = R, at least for some angles,\nso at r = R Laplace's equation does not hold. Thus we expect V (r, θ, φ) to have the form\nof Eq. (7.4) for r < R and r > R, but we are likely to need different functions Rl(r) for\neach region. We therefore write\ninf\nVin =\n\nAin\nlrl\nBin\n+\nl\nPl(cos θ)\nrl+1\nl=0\n\n(7.5)\ninf\nVout =\n\nAout\nl\nrl\nBout\n+\nl\n\nPl(cos θ) ,\nrl+1\nl=0\nwhere \"in\" and \"out\" refer to the values inside (r < R) and outside (r > R) the sphere.\nSince the Bin\nl\nterms would be singular at r = 0, they are not allowed: Bin\nl= 0. Simi-\nlarly, the Aout\nl\nterms would diverge at infinity, which is not possible for a finite charge\ndistribution, so Aout\nl\n= 0. At the surface r = R we expect the electric field to be dis-\ncontinuous, but it will not be infinite -- we have calculated the electric field of a surface\ncharge layer, and it is finite. The potential difference between a point just inside the\nsurface and a point just outside the surface is given by a line integral from one point to\nthe other,\nE ·dl. Since the integrand is finite and the length of the path is infinitesimal,\nthe integral vanishes. The potential is thus required to be continuous at r = R, which\nimplies that\nAin\nlRl\nBout\n=\nl\n(7.6)\nRl+1\nfor all l. (The terms have to match for each l, because the Legendre polynomials Pl(cos θ)\nare orthogonal, so a mismatch at one value of lcannot be compensated by other values\nof l.) Thus Bout\nl\n= R2l+1 Ain\nl. The expression for V can be written very compactly by\ndefining\nA l= Rl+1Ain\nl= R-lBout\nl\n,\n(7.7)\nand then\ninf\nrl\nA l\nPl(cos θ)\nfor r < R\nRl+1\nl=0\nV (r, θ, φ) =\n\n(7.8)\ninf\n\nAl\nPl\nθ\nr > R\n\nrl+1\nl=0\nIf we now define\n\nr> ≡larger(r, R) and r< ≡smaller(r, R) ,\n(7.9)\nthen Eq.

We could have written Rl(r) as\nrl\nRl\nRl(r) = Al\n+ Bl\n,\n(7.2\nRl+1\nrl+1\n′)\nwhere the extra factors of R do nothing more than redefine the as yet unknown parameters\nAland Bl. Eq. (7.2′) has the virtue that Aland Blhave the same units. With this\nstarting point, the argument used above leads to the conclusion that Bout\nin\nl\n= Al, with\nno factors of R to complicate the equation. It is easy to see that Alin this approach is\nequal to A lin the approach that we used.)\nTo finish the problem, we need to calculate the A l. They are clearly determined by\nthe presence of the charge, and we can account for the surface charge density by imposing\nthe discontinuity in the normal component of the electric field that is required by Gauss's\nlaw:\nσ(θ)\nEr|R+ -Er|R\n=\n,\n(7.11)\n-\nε0\nwhere\nσ0\nif θ > α\nσ(θ) =\n(7.12)\nif θ < α .\nEq.

The\nnotes will describe a topic that I did not have time to include in the lecture: the relation\nbetween the traceless symmetric tensor expansion and the standard spherical harmonics.\nUsing traceless symmetric tensors, we can expand any function of angle as\ninf\ninf\nF(ˆn) =\n\n(l)\nCi\nn\n1i2...i n\nlˆi1 ˆi2 . . . nˆil≡\n\nFl(ˆn)\nl=1\nl=0\n(8.1)\n= C(0) +\n(1)\nCi\nnˆi +\n(2)\nCij nˆinˆj +\n(3)\nCijk nˆinˆjnˆk + . . . ,\nwhere the\n(l)\nCi1i2...ilare traceless symmetric tensors, the indices i1, i2, . . . ilare summed\nfrom 1 to 3 as Cartesian indices, and\nnˆ(θ, φ) = sin θ cos φ eˆ1 + sin θ sin φ eˆ2 + cos θ eˆ3 ,\n(8.2)\nwhere eˆ1, ˆe2, and eˆ3 can also be written as eˆx, ˆey, and eˆz.\nIn the more standard approach, an arbitrary function of (θ, φ) is expanded in spher-\nical harmonics:\ninf\nl\nF(ˆn) =\n\nl=1 m\n\nalmYlm(θ, φ) .\n(8.3)\n=-l\nWe have shown that\n∇2\n(l)\nθ Ci1i2...i n\nlˆi1nˆi2 . . . nˆ\nl\ni\n\n(\nl\n= -l(l+ 1)\n)\nCi1i2...i n\nlˆi1nˆi2 . . . nˆil,\n(8.4)\nwhere\n∇2\n∂\n∂\n∂2\nθ =\n\nsin θ\n+\n.\nsin θ ∂θ\n∂θ\n\nsin2\n(8.5)\nθ ∂φ2\nIn the standard approach one would show that\n∇2\nθ Ylm(θ, φ) = -l(l+ 1)Ylm(θ, φ) ,\n(8.6)\nso lapparently has the same meaning in both formalisms. (I am not trying here to de-\nrive the standard formalism, but instead I will simply adopt the equations from standard\ntextbooks, and show that we can express these functions in terms of traceless symmetric\n\n8.07 LECTURE NOTES 8, FALL 2012\np. 2\ntensors. A good example of such a standard textbook is J.D. Jackson, Classical Elec-\ntrodynamics, 3rd Edition (John Wiley & Sons, 1999), Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.5, and 3.6.\nThat means that there must be some particular traceless symmetric tensor, which we will\ncall\n(l,m)\nCi1...i\nYlm θ, φ\nlwhich is equivalent to\n(\n). That is,\n(l,m)\nCi1...i nˆi1 . . . nˆil= Ylm(θ, φ\nl\n) .\n(8.7)\nOur goal is to construct\n(l,m)\nCi1...ilexplicitly. We have already shown that the number of\nlinearly independent traceless symmetric tensors of rank l(i.e., with lindices) is given\nby 2l+ 1, which is not surprisingly equal to the number of Ylm functions for a given l.\nThe quantity m is an integer from -lto l, so there are 2l+ 1 possible values.\nWe consider first the case of azimuthal symmetry, where F(ˆn) is invariant under\nrotations about the z-axis, and hence independent of φ. In that case, within the standard\ntreatment, the most general function can be expanded in Legendre polynomials,\ninf\nF(ˆn) =\n\nalPl(cos θ) .\n(8.8)\nl=0\nThe Plfunctions are the same as the Yl0 functions, except that they are normalized\ndifferently:\n\n2l+ 1\nYl0(θ, φ) =\nP\nl(cos θ) .\n(8.9)\nπ\nThe Legendre polynomials can be written explicitly using Rodrigues' formula:\nd\nl\nP (x) =\n\n(x2\nl\nl\n2ll!\ndx\n-1)\n\n.\n(8.10)\nIn the traceless symmetric tensor formalism, the azimuthal symmetry case must be de-\nscribed by traceless symmetric tensors that are invariant under rotations about the z-axis.\nIt is easiest to begin by thinking about l= 1, where we are seeking a tensor\n(1)\nCi\n. Since\n(1)\nCi\nhas one index, it is a vector, which is the same as a tensor of rank 1. It is obvious\nthat the only vector that is invariant under rotations about the z-axis is a vector that\npoints along the z axis. I will let zˆ be a unit vector in the z-direction (which I have also\ncalled eˆz and eˆ3), and then for azimuthal symmetry we have\n(1)\nCi\n= const zˆi ,\n(8.11)\nwhere zˆi = δi3 is the i'th component of zˆ. The resulting function of nˆ is then\nF1(ˆn) =\n(1)\nCi\nnˆi = const zˆinˆi = const zˆ · nˆ = const cos θ ,\n(8.12)\n\n8.07 LECTURE NOTES 8, FALL 2012\np. 3\nwhich certainly agrees with P1(cos θ) = cos θ.\nTo generalize to arbitrary l, we can construct a tensor of rank lthat is invariant\nunder rotations about the z-axis by considering the product zˆi1zˆi2 . . . zˆil. This is clearly\nsymmetric, but it is not traceless. However, we can make it traceless by taking its traceless\npart, which I denote by curly brackets.\n{ zˆi1zˆi2 . . . zˆil} ≡traceless symmetric part of zˆi1zˆi2 . . . zˆil.\n(8.13)\nThe traceless symmetric part is constructed by starting with the original expression and\nthen subtracting terms proportional to one or more Kronecker δ-functions, where the\nsubtractions are uniquely determined by the requirement that the expression be traceless.\nFor example,\n{ 1 } = 1\n{ zˆi } = ˆzi\n{ zˆizˆj } = ˆzizˆj -1δij\n(8.14)\n{ zˆ zˆ zˆ } = ˆz zˆ zˆ -1\ni j k\ni j k\nz\n5 ˆiδjk + ˆzjδik + ˆzkδij\n{ zˆ z\niˆjzˆkzˆm } = ˆzizˆjzˆkzˆm -\n\nzˆizˆjδkm + ˆzizˆkδmj\n\n+ ˆzizˆmδjk + ˆzjzˆkδim\n+ ˆzjzˆmδik + ˆz\nkzˆmδij +\nδijδkm + δikδjm\n+ δimδjk\n,\nwhere the coefficients are all determined b\n\ny the\n\nrequirement of tracelessness.\n\nWe will\nargue later that Eq. (8.14) gives the only traceless symmetric tensors that are invariant\nunder rotations about the z-axis, and therefore the function\nFl(ˆn) = { zˆi1 . . . zˆil} nˆi1 . . . nˆil\n(8.15)\nis the only function, up to a multiplicative constant, that is azimuthally symmetric and\nsatisfies ∇2\nθ\nl\nl\nl\n∇2\nθPl(cos θ) = -l(l+ 1)Pl(cos θ), we must have\nPl(cos θ) = const{ zˆi1 . . .zˆil} nˆi1 . . . nˆil,\n(8.16)\nwhere the constant is yet to be determined.\nBoth sides of Eq. (8.16) are polynomials in cos θ, where the highest power is coslθ.\nIf we can find the coefficients of this highest power on each side of the equation, we\ncan determine the constant. On the right-hand side, the highest power comes entirely\nfrom the zˆi1 . . . zˆilterm in { zˆi1 . . . zˆil}, since all the other terms contain Kronecker δ-\nfunctions which result in factors of the form nˆ · nˆ = 1, reducing the number of nˆ factors\navailable to give powers of cos θ. So, the leading term on the right-hand side is simply\nF (ˆn) = -l(l+1)F (ˆn). Since P (cos θ) is azimuthally symmetric and satisfies\n\n8.07 LECTURE NOTES 8, FALL 2012\np. 4\nconst(zˆ · nˆ)l= const coslθ. For the left-hand side, we can use Rodrigues' formula to\nextract the highest power:\nPl(x) = 2ll!\nd\nl\n(x2\n1)l\ndx\n\n-\n\n=\nd l\nx2l+ (lower powers)\n2ll!\ndx\nl\n\nd\n-1\n=\n\n(2l)x2l-1 + (lower powers)\n2ll!\ndx\n\n(8.17)\n= 2ll!\nd\nx\nl-2\n(2l)(2l\nd\n-1)x2l-2 + (lower powers)\n\n=\n(2l)(2l\n1) . . .(l+ 1)xl+ (lower powers)\n2ll!\n\n-\n(2l)!\n\n=\nxl+ (lower powers) .\n2l(l!)2\nMatching these coefficients, we see that\n(2l)!\nPl(cos θ) =\n{ zˆi1 . . .zˆil} nˆ\n. . .\n2l(l!)\ni\nnˆil.\n(8.18)\nNow we can return to the general case, in which there is no azimuthal symmetry,\nand the expansion requires the spherical harmonics, Ylm. The Ylm are chosen to have a\nvery simple dependence on φ, namely\nYlm(θ, φ) ∝eimφ .\n(8.19)\nThis property can be described in terms of how the functions transform under a rotation\nof the coordinate system about the z-axis. Under a rotation by an angle ψ about the\nz-axis, the angle φ changes by ψ, and Ylm changes by a factor eiψ. I have not been\ncareful here about specifying the sign of this rotation, because it will be easy to fix the\nsign conventions at the end. The important point here is that if we want to match the\nconventions of the spherical harmonics, we need to construct traceless symmetric tensors\nthat are modified by a rotation only by a multiplicative phase factor. That is, we are\nlooking for tensors that are complex, and that are eigenvectors of the rotation operator.\nNaturally we begin by considering a vector (a tensor with one index, or a rank 1\ntensor), which under a rotation about the z-axis transforms as\nvx\n′ = vx cos ψ -vy sin ψ\n(8.20)\nvy\n′ = vx sin ψ + vy cos ψ .\n\n8.07 LECTURE NOTES 8, FALL 2012\np. 5\nWe thus seek an eigenvector of the matrix\nR =\n\ncos ψ\n-sin ψ\nsin ψ\ncos ψ\n\n.\n(8.21)\nThe eigenvalues λ of the matrix are determined by the characteristic equation\ndet(R -λI) = 0 ,\n(8.22)\nwhere I is the identity matrix, which can be expanded as\ndet\n\ncos ψ -λ\n-sin ψ\n\n= 0\n=⇒\nλ2\nsin ψ\ncos ψ -λ\n-λ cos ψ + 1 = 0 ,\n(8.23)\nfor which the solutions are\nλ = cos ψ ±\n\ncos2 ψ -1 = cos ψ ± i sin ψ = e±iψ .\n(8.24)\nThe eigenvectors then satisfy\n\ncos ψ -e±iψ\n-sin ψ\nsin ψ\ncos ψ -e±iψ\n\nvx\nvy\n\n= 0 ,\n(8.25)\nwhich simplifies to\n\n∓i sin ψ\n-sin ψ\nvx\n= 0 ,\n(8.26)\nsin ψ\n∓i sin ψ\n\nvy\n\nfrom which we see that vy = ∓ivx. Constructing normalized eigenvectors, we can define\nuˆ(1) ≡uˆ+\n= √(ˆex + ieˆ\ny)\n(8.27)\nuˆ(2)\n≡uˆ-= √(ˆe\nx -ieˆy) ,\nwhich are orthonormal in the sense that\nuˆ(i)∗· uˆ(j) = δij .\n(8.28)\nWe can complete a basis for three-dimensional vectors by adding\nuˆ(3) ≡zˆ = ˆez .\n(8.29)\nYou might ask how one should visualize a vector with imaginary components. What\ndirection does it point?\nIt certainly points in a definite direction in complex three-\ndimensional space, which is equivalent to a six-dimensional real-valued space, but for our\n\n8.07 LECTURE NOTES 8, FALL 2012\np. 6\npurposes we do not need to have any geometric picture of these vectors. We are simply\ngoing to use them to form dot products to construct (complex-valued) functions of θ and\nφ.\nNote that complex conjugation, as used in Eq. (8.28), is essential for defining a\npositive definite norm for complex vectors. The quantities uˆ(+) · uˆ(+) and uˆ(-) · uˆ(-), by\ncontrast, are in fact equal to zero. This leads to the convenient fact that\nuˆ+\ni1 . . . uˆ+\nil\n(8.30)\nis both traceless and symmetric.\nSince\nuˆ+\n· nˆ = √sin θeiφ ,\n(8.31)\nwe can construct functions proportional to eimφ, for m > 0, by including m factors of\nuˆ+, and arranging for each of them to be dotted into nˆ. This can be done by considering\nthe function defined by\nFlm(θ, φ) ≡{ uˆ+\ni1 . . . uˆ+\nimzˆim+1 . . .zˆil} nˆi1 . . . nˆil.\n(8.32)\nTo see that in this expression every uˆ+ is dotted into an nˆ, recall that uˆ+·zˆ = ˆu+·uˆ+ = 0.\nSo, when the right-hand side is expanded and all the indices are summed to give dot\nproducts, the only terms that survive are those for which every uˆ+ is dotted into zˆ.\nThus, the right-hand side of Eq. (8.32) is proportional to eimφ. From Eq. (8.4), we know\nthat the right-hand side of Eq. (8.32) is an eigenfunction of ∇2\nθ with eigenvalue -l(l+1).\nI will argue below that any such eigenvector that is proportional to eimφ is necessarily\nproportional to Ylm. We will return to the question of uniqueness, but let us first assume\nthat uniqueness holds, so that\nFlm(θ, φ) ∝Ylm(θ, φ) .\n(8.33)\nAs in the previous derivation for Legendre polynomials, we can determine the constant\nof proportionality by matching the leading term in the expansions of both sides of the\nequation. Flm(θ, φ) can be written as (sin θ)m eimφ times a polynomial in cos θ, so we\ncan use the highest power of cos θ to determine the matching.\nIt is easy to extract the leading term from Eq. (8.32), because it comes from the first\nterm in the expansion of\n{ uˆ+\ni . . .uˆ+\ni zˆim+1 } = ˆu+\nˆ+\ni . . . ui zi\nm\nm ˆ m+1 . . . zˆil+ terms ∝δipiq .\n(8.34)\nThe first term gives the highest power of cos θ, because the Kronecker δ-functions that\nappear in all later terms cause one or more nˆ's to dot with other nˆ's, reducing the number\nof nˆ's available to appear in the form nˆ · zˆ = cos θ. Thus,\nFlm(θ, φ) = 2-m/2(sin θ)meimφ\n(cos θ)l-m + (lower powers of cos θ)\n\n.\n(8.35)\n\n8.07 LECTURE NOTES 8, FALL 2012\np. 7\nTo compare Eq. (8.35) with the leading term in the expansion for the standard\nfunction Ylm, we need a formula for Ylm(θ, φ).\nIt is given in Jackson as Eq. (3.53),\np. 108, as\nYlm(θ, φ) =\n\n2l+ 1 (l-m)! P m\nl(cos θ)eimφ ,\n(8.36)\n4π\n(l+ m)!\nwhere P m\nl(cos θ) is the associated Legendre function, which can be defined by Jackson's\nEq.

(l-m)!\nIt is worth mentioning that the curly brackets indicating \"traceless symmetric part\"\ncan be put on either factor or both in expressions such as Eq. (8.32). That is,\n{ uˆ+\ni . . . uˆ+\ni zˆim+1 . . . zˆil} nˆi1 . . . nˆil= { uˆ+\ni . . . uˆ+\ni zˆi\n. . .\nm\nm\nm\n+1\nzˆil} { nˆi1 . . . nˆil} (8.44a)\n= ˆu+\ni . . . u\nˆ+\ni z\nm ˆim+1 . . . zˆil{ nˆi1 . . . nˆil} ,\n(8.44b)\n|\n| ∗\n\n8.07 LECTURE NOTES 8, FALL 2012\np. 8\nwhere the top line is justified because { nˆi1 . . . nˆil} differs from nˆi1 . . . nˆilonly by terms\nproportional to Kronecker δ-functions, which give no contribution when summed with\nthe traceless symmetric tensor { uˆ+\ni . . . uˆ+\ni zˆi\nm+1 . . . zˆil}.\nSimilarly, once the second\nfactor is written in traceless symmetric fo\nm\nrm, there is no longer a need to take the\ntraceless symmetric part of the first term, since { uˆ+\ni . . .u+ zi\n. . . zi\nˆim ˆ m+1\nˆ l} differs from\nuˆ+\n+\ni . . . u\nˆi z\nm ˆim+1 . . . zˆilonly by terms proportional to Kronecker δ-functions, which vanish\nwhen summed with the traceless symmetric tensor { nˆi1 . . . nˆil}.\nFinally, we can return to the question of uniqueness. In asserting that Flm(θ, φ) ∝\nYlm(θ, φ), we knew that both functions are proportional to eimφ, and that both are\neigenfunctions of ∇2\nθ with eigenvalue -l(l+ 1). We claimed that, up to a multiplicative\nconstant, there is only one function that has these properties. Assuming that the power\nseries representation of Eq. (8.1) always exists, the uniqueness that we need is easy to\nsee. We showed in lecture that the number of linearly independent traceless symmetric\ntensors of rank\n(l,m)\nlis 2l+1, and now we have constructed 2l+1 such tensors: the Ci1...i\nm = -l, . . ., l. These are clearly linearly independent, since they are each eigenfunc\nl\ntions\nof rotations about the z-axis with different eigenvalues. Thus, any traceless symmetric\ntensor of rank lmust be a linear sum of the tensors in our basis. When we also specify\nthat the tensor being sought is an eigenvector of rotations about the z-axis, with a specific\neigenvalue, then only one of the tensors in our basis can contribute.\nThe above argument is solid, but one might still wonder what happens if we try,\nfor example, to construct a different tensor by using both uˆ+'s and uˆ-'s in the same\nexpression. For example, we might consider { uˆ+\ni uˆ-\nj } , which is invariant under rotations\nabout the z-axis. With a little work, however, one can show that\n{ uˆ+\ni uˆ-\nj } = -2{ zˆizˆj } .\n(8.45)\n, for\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n8.07 Electromagnetism II\nFall 2012\n\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

The solutions will involve Legendre polyno-\nmials for cases with azimuthal symmetry, and more generally they will involve spherical\nharmonics.\nI will construct these solutions using traceless symmetric tensors, but in\nLecture Notes 8 I describe how the solutions in this form relate to the more standard ex-\npressions in terms of Legendre polynomials and spherical harmonics. (Logically Lecture\nNotes 8 should come after these notes, although they were posted first.) If you are start-\ning from scratch, I think that the traceless symmetric tensor method is the simplest way\nto understand this mathematical formalism. If you already know spherical harmonics, I\nthink that you will find the traceless symmetric tensor approach to be a useful addition\nto your arsenal of mathematical methods. The symmetric traceless tensor approach is\nparticularly useful if one needs to extend the formalism beyond what we will be doing --\nfor example, there are analogues of spherical harmonics in higher dimensions, and there\nare also vector spherical harmonics that are useful for expanding vector functions of angle.\nVector spherical harmonics are used in the most general treatments of electromagnetic\nradiation, although we will not be introducing them in this course.\nI don't know a reference for the traceless symmetric tensor method, which is the main\nreason I am writing these notes. For the standard method, limited to the case of azimuthal\nsymmetry, our textbook by Griffiths should be sufficient. If you would like to see an\nadditional reference on spherical harmonics, which are needed when there is no azimuthal\nsymmetry, then I would recommend J.D. Jackson, Classical Electrodynamics, 3rd\nEdition (John Wiley & Sons, 1999), Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.5, and 3.6.\n1.

If such a function F can be found, we say that F is an\neigenfunction of the operator ∇2\nθ, with eigenvalue Cθ.\nA function of angles (θ, φ) can equivalently be thought of as a function of the unit\nvector nˆ that points in the direction of θ and φ, which can be written explicitly as\nnˆ = sin θ cos φ eˆ1 + sin θ sin φ eˆ2 + cos θ eˆ3 ,\n(9.9)\nwhere eˆ1, ˆe2, and eˆ3 can also be written as eˆx, ˆey, and eˆz. I am labeling the unit vectors\nusing the numbers 1, 2, and 3 when I am thinking about summing over the indices, and\notherwise I use x, y, and z.\nI now claim that the most general function of (θ, φ) can be written as a power series\nin nˆ, or more precisely as a power series in the components of nˆ. I will not prove this,\n\n8.07 LECTURE NOTES 9, FALL 2012\np. 3\nbut it is true at least for square-integrable piece-wise continuous functions F(θ, φ). Such\na power series can be written as\nF(ˆn) = C(0) +\n(1)\nCi\nnˆi +\n(2)\nCij nˆinˆ\n(\nj + . . . +\nl)\nCi1i2...i n\nlˆi1nˆi2 . . . nˆil+ . . . ,\n(9.10)\nwhere repeated indices are summed from 1 to 3 (as Cartesian coordinates). Note that\n(l)\nCi1i2...i ni\nlˆ 1nˆi2 . . .nˆilrepresents the general term in the series, where the first three terms\ncorrespond to l= 0, l= 1, and l= 2. The indices i1, i2, . . . , ilrepresent ldifferent\nindices, like i and j; since they are repeated, they are each summed from 1 to 3.\nThe coefficients\n(l)\nCi1i2...ilare called tensors, and the number of indices is called the\nrank of the tensor. Note that\n(0),\n(1)\nC\nCi\n, and\n(2)\nCij\nare special cases of tensors, although\nthey can also be considered a scalar, a vector, and a matrix.\nIt is possible to impose restrictions on the coefficients of Eq. (9.10) without actually\nrestricting what can appear on the right-hand side of the equations. In particular, we\nwill insist that\n1) The tensors\n(l)\nCi1i2...ilare symmetric under any reordering of the indices:\n(l)\n(l)\nCi1i\nC\n2...il=\nj1j2...j ,\nl\n(9.11)\nwhere {j1, j2, . . ., jl} is any permutation of {i1, i2, . . ., il}.\n2) The tensors\n(l)\nCi1i2...i are traceless, in the sense that if any two indices are set equal\nto each other and summed,\nl\nthe result is equal to zero. Since the tensors are already\nassumed to be symmetric, it does not matter which indices are summed, so we can\nchoose the last two:\n(l)\nCi1i2...i\n.\nl\n2jj\n-\nTo explain why these restrictions on the C(l)'s do not impose any restriction on the right-\nhand side of Eq. (9.10), I will use the example of\n(2)\nCij , but I think you will be able to see\nthat that the argument applies to all l. The insistence that\n(2)\nCij\nis symmetric can be seen\nto make no difference to the right-hand side of Eq. (9.10), because\n(2)\nCij\nmultiplies the\nsymmetric tensor nˆinˆj. Thus, if\n(2)\nCij\nhad an antisymmetric part, it would not contribute\nto the right-hand side of Eq. (9.10). The requirement of tracelessness is less obvious, but\nsuppose that\n(2)\nCij\nwere not traceless. Then we could write\n(2)\nCii\n= λ = 0 .\n(9.13)\n= 0\n(9.12)\n\n8.07 LECTURE NOTES 9, FALL 2012\np. 4\nWe could then define a new quantity,\nC (2)\nij\n=\n(2)\nCij -\nλδij .\n(9.14)\nIt follows that C (2)\nij\nis traceless:\n(2)\nCii\n=\n(2)\nCii\n-\nλδ\nii = λ -\nλδ\nii = 0 ,\n(9.15)\nsince δii = 3. The original term\n(2)\nCij nˆinˆj can then be expressed in terms of C (2)\nij :\n(2)ˆ ˆ =\n\n(2)\nCij ninj\nCij +\nλδ\nij\n\nnˆinˆ\n(2)\nj = Cij nˆinˆj +\nλ ,\n(9.16)\nwhere we used the fact that δijnˆinˆj = 1, since nˆ is a unit vector. The extra term, 1λ\n3 ,\ncan then be absorbed into a redefinition of C(0):\nC (0) = C(0) +\nλ .\n(9.17)\nFinally, we can write\nC(0) +\n(1)\n)\nC\nnˆi +\n(2)\n(1)\n(2\ni\nCij nˆ nˆj = C (0)\ni\n+ Ci\nnˆi + C ij nˆinˆj ,\n(9.18)\nso we can insist that the tensor that multiplies nˆinˆj be traceless with no restriction on\nwhat functions can be expressed in this form.\nI will call the l'th term of this expansion Fl(ˆn), so\nFl\ni1i2...i\ni\nl\ni2\nil\n3. EVALUATION OF ∇2F\nθ\nl(ˆn):\nTo evaluate ∇2\nθFl(ˆn), we are going to take advantage of a convenient trick. Instead\nof dealing directly with Fl(ˆn), we will instead introduce a radial variable r, using it to\ndefine a coordinate vector\nr = rn .\nˆ\n(9.20)\nFollowing the notation of Griffiths (see his Eq. (1.19)), I will denote the coordinates of r\nby x, y, and z, or in index notation I will call them xi. So\nr = xieˆi = x1eˆ1 + x2eˆ2 + x3eˆ3 .\n(9.21)\n(ˆn) =\n(l)\nC\nnˆ nˆ\n. . . nˆ\n.\n(9.19)\n\n8.07 LECTURE NOTES 9, FALL 2012\np. 5\nThen, given any Fl(ˆn) of the form given in Eq. (9.19), we can define a function F l(r) by\nF\n(l)\nl\nl(r) = Ci1i2...i xi\nl\n1xi2 . . . xil= r Fl(ˆn) .\n(9.22)\nNote that\n(l)\nCi i ...i\nis the same rank l\nF\n1 2\nl\ntraceless symmetric tensor used to define\nl(ˆn),\nbut we are defining F l(r) by multiplying\n(l)\nCi i ...i by xi1xi2 . . .xi and then summing over\nindices, instead of multiplying by ˆ\n1 2\nl\nl\nni1nˆi2 . . . nˆiland then summing.\nNow we can make use of Eq. (9.1), which relates the full Laplacian ∇2 to the angular\nLaplacian, ∇2\nθ. We will find that in this case the full Laplacian and the radial derivative\npiece of Eq. (9.1) will both be simple, so we will be able to determine the angular Laplacian\nby evaluating the other terms in Eq. (9.1).\nTo evaluate ∇2F l(r), we start with l= 0. Clearly\n∇2F 0(r) = ∇2C(0) = 0 ,\n(9.23)\nsince the derivative of a constant vanishes. Similarly for l= 1,\n∇2F\n(1)\n1(r) = ∇Ci\nxi = 0 ,\n(9.24)\nsince the first derivative produces a constant, so the second derivative vanishes. The first\nnontrivial case is l= 2:\n∇2F (r) = ∇2\n(2)\nCij xixj\n=\n(2)\n∂\n∂\nCij\n(xixj)\n∂xm ∂xm\n(9.25)\n(2\n∂\n=\n)\nCij\n[δimxj + δjmxi]\n∂xm\n= 2\n(2)\nC\n[\n(2)\nij\nδimδjm] = 2Cii\n= 0 ,\nwhere in the last step we used the all-important fact that\n(2)\nCij\nis traceless. We will look\nat one more case, and then I hope it will be clear that it generalizes. For l= 3,\n∇2F3 r\n∇2Cijkxixjxk\n=\n(3)\n∂\n∂\nCijk\n(xixjxk)\n∂xm ∂xm\n∂\n=\n(3)\nCijk\n\nδimxjxk + (terms that symmetrize in ijk)\n∂xm\n\n(9.26)\n=\n(3)\nCijk\n\nδimδjmxk + (terms that symmetrize in ijk)\n\n=\n(3)\nCijk\n\nδijxk + (terms that symmetrize in ijk)\n\n=\n(3)\nCiik xk + (terms that symmetrize in ijk) = 0 ,\n( ) =\n(3)\n\n8.07 LECTURE NOTES 9, FALL 2012\np. 6\nwhere again it is the tracelessness of\n(l)\nCi1i2...ilthat caused the term to vanish. Thinking\nabout the general term, one can see that after the derivatives are calculated, there are\nl-2 factors of xi that remain, but there are still lindices on\n(l)\nCi1i2...il. Since all indices are\nsummed, there are always two indices on\n(l)\nCi1i2...i which are contracted (i.e., set equal to\neach other) and summed, which causes the result\nl\nto vanish by the tracelessness condition.\nThe bottom line, then, is that\n∇2F l(r) = 0\nfor all l.\n(9.27)\nTo see what this says about ∇2\nl\nθFl(ˆn), recall that F l(r) = r Fl(ˆn). Using Eq. (9.1),\nwe can write\n1 ∂\n\n∂F\n\n0 =\n\n∇Fl(r) =\nl(r)\nr\n\n+\n∇2\nθ F l(r)\nr2 ∂r\n∂r\nr2\n1 d\nl\n=\n\nr2 dr\nFl(ˆn) +\nrl\nr2 dr\ndr\nr2\n∇2\nθ Fl(ˆn)\n= rl-2\nl(l+ 1)Fl(ˆn) + ∇2\nθ Fl(ˆn)\n\n,\nand therefore\n∇2\nθ Fl(ˆn) = -l(l+ 1)Fl(ˆn) .\n(9.28)\nThus, we have found the eigenfunctions\n\n(ˆ) =\n(l)\nFln\nCi1i2...i nˆi1nˆi2 . . . nˆi\nl\nl\nand eigen-\nvalues\n\n-l(l+ 1)\n\nof the differential operator ∇2\nθ. This is a very useful resul\n\nt!\n4. GENERAL SOLUTION TO LAPLACE'S EQUATION IN SPHERICAL\nCOORDINATES:\nNow that we know the eigenfunctions of ∇2\nθ, we can return to the solution to Laplace's\nequation by the separation of variables in spherical coordinates. We now know that in\nEq. (9.6), the only allowed values of Cθ are -l(l+ 1), where lis an integer.\nThus,\nEq. (9.7) becomes\nd\nr2 dR\n= l(l+ 1)R ,\n(9.29)\ndr\n\ndr\n\nand we can look for solutions by trying R(r) = rp. We find consistency provided that\np(p + 1) = l(l+ 1) ,\n(9.30)\n\n8.07 LECTURE NOTES 9, FALL 2012\np. 7\nwhich is a quadratic equation with two roots, p = land p = -(l+ 1). Since we found\ntwo solutions to a second order linear differential equation, we know that any solution\ncan be written as a linear sum of these two. Thus we can write\nRl(r) = Alrl\nB\n+\nl\n,\n(9.31)\nrl+1\nallowing for different values of Aland Blfor each l.\nThe most general solution to\nLaplace's equation, in spherical coordinates, can then be written as\ninf\nΦ(r) =\n\nl\nB\nAlr +\nl\n\n(l)\nCi\ni nˆi\n1i2... l\n1nˆi2 . . . nˆil,\n(9.32)\nrl+1\nl=0\nwhere the Al's and Bl's are arbitrary constants, and each\n(l)\nCi1i2...ilis an arbitrary traceless\nsymmetric tensor.\nIn Lecture Notes 8 it is shown explicitly that the l'th term here, when compared\nwith the standard expansion in the spherical harmonic functions Ylm(θ, φ), corresponds\nto the sum of all terms with the same l, but for all m. The Ylm's are defined for integer\nvalues of m from -lto l, so there are 2l+ 1 terms for each value of l.\n5. COUNTING THE NUMBER LINEARLY INDEPENDENT TRACELESS\nSYMMETRIC TENSORS:\nUsing the fact that\n(l)\nCi1i2...i is traceless and symmetric, we can determine how many\nlinearly independent such tenso\nl\nrs exist, for any given l. In other words, how many real\nconstants are needed to parameterize the most general traceless symmetric tensor of rank\nl\nWe begin by calculating Nsym(l), the number of linearly independent symmetric\ntensors of rank l. Note that we are postponing the consideration of tracelessness. For\ngrounding, we can start by saying that it takes one number to specify S(0), a rank 0\nsymmetric tensor, because it is just a number. (I am using S for symmetric tensors,\nwhile reserving C for traceless symmetric tensors.) It takes 3 numbers to specify\n(1)\nSi\n,\nsince the 3 values\n(1)\n(1)\n(1)\nS1 ,\n(2)\nS2 , and S3\ncan each be specified independently. For Sij ,\nhowever, we see the constraints of symmetry:\n(2) has to equal\n(2)\nSij\nSji , so there are fewer\nthan 9 independent values; there are 6, which can be taken to be\n(2)\n(2\nS\n,\n(2)\n(2\n12 ,\n)\nS\nS13 ,\n)\nS22 ,\n(2)\nS23 ,\n(2)\nS33 , with\n(2)\nS21 ,\n(2)\nS31 , and\n(2)\nS32 determined by symmetry. Since the order of the\nindices does not matter, we can always list the indices in ascending order (as I did for\n?\n\n8.07 LECTURE NOTES 9, FALL 2012\np. 8\n(2)\nSij ) and then each independent entry will occur once. When the indices are so written\nin ascending order, then the index values are completely determined if we just specify\nhow many indices are equal to 1, how many are equal to 2, and how many are equal to 3.\nIf it helps, we can imagine three hats, labeled 1, 2, and 3, and lindistinguishable balls,\nrepresenting the lindices of a rank ltensor. There is then a 1:1 correspondence between\nindependent tensor elements and the different ways that the balls can be put into the\nhats. For example, if there are 9 balls, with 3 in the first hat, 2 in the second, and 4 in\nthe third, then this arrangement of balls corresponds to\n(9)\nS111223333. So now we just have\nto figure out how many different ways we can put lindistinguishable balls into 3 hats.\nOne way of counting the balls-in-hats problem is to imagine first labeling each ball\nwith a number, so they are no longer indistinguishable. We also introduce 2 dividers,\nwhere 2 is one less than the number of hats. Initially we will also assign numbers to the 2\ndividers. Thinking of the balls and dividers together, we have l+2 distinguishable objects.\nWe can imagine listing them in all possible orderings, and with l+ 2 distinguishable\nobjects there are (l+ 2)! orderings. For each ordering there is an equivalent balls-in-\nhats assignment. The balls to the left of the left-most divider are assigned to hat 1, the\nballs between the two dividers are assigned to hat 2, and the balls to the right of the\nright-most divider are assigned to hat 3. We have of course overcounted, since many\ndifferent orderings of our l+ 2 objects will lead to the same number of balls in each hat.\nHowever, we can see exactly by how much we have overcounted. We can re-order the l\nballs without changing the number of balls in each hat, and we can interchange the two\ndividers. So we have overcounted by a factor of 2l!. Thus,\n(l+ 2)!\nNsym(l) =\n=\n(l+ 1)(l+ 2) .\n(9.33)\n2l!\nIt is easily checked that this gives Nsym(0) = 1, Nsym(1) = 3, and Nsym(2) = 6, consistent\nwith the examples we started with.\nTo impose tracelessness, we require that our traceless tensors also satisfy\n(l)\nSi1...il-2jj = 0 .\n(9.34)\nHow many conditions is this? One can see that the tensor on the left is a symmetric tensor\nof rank l-2, with free indices i1 . . . il\n2. The number of conditions is then N\n-\nsym(l-2).\nThe number of linearly indendent traceless symmetric tensors is then given by\nNtraceless\nsym(l) = Nsym(l) -Nsym(l\n-\n-2) =\n(l+ 1)(l+ 2) -\n(l\n-1)l\n(9.35)\n=\n2l+ 1 .\nSo the correspondence with the standard Ylm's is consistent, as it would have to\nbe. The spherical harmonic expansion is just a rewriting of Eq. (9.32), with a particular\nchoice of basis for the 2l+ 1 independent traceless symmetric tensors of rank l.\n\n8.07 LECTURE NOTES 9, FALL 2012\np. 9\n6. SPECIAL CASE: AZIMUTHAL SYMMETRY:\nAzimuthal symmetry means symmetry under rotation about an axis, which we will\ntake to be the z-axis. Equivalently, we can say that a problem is azimuthally symmetric\nif nothing depends on the coordinate φ. To specialize the general expansion (9.10) for a\nfunction of (θ, φ) to the azimuthally symmetric case, we need to construct traceless sym-\nmetric tensors which are invariant under rotations about the z-axis. One straightforward\nway to this is to build the traceless symmetric tensor from the vector zˆ, the unit vector in\nthe z direction. Note that the x-, y-, and z- components of zˆ are 0, 0, and 1, respectively,\nso zˆi = δi3.\n[You may have noticed an inconsistency in my notation, as earlier (e.g., Eq. (9.9))\nI used eˆ3 or eˆz for the unit vector in the z direction. In this case my inconsistency was\nintentional, with two motivations. First, previously we never needed a notation for the\ncomponents of a unit basis vector, but here we will. It would be a real pain to write\n(ˆez)i. Second, in Lecture Notes 8 I describe a convenient way to construct a basis for the\ntraceless symmetric tensors, which involves the use of a basis for vectors consisting of zˆ\nand two complex vectors uˆ+ and uˆ-. So, the use of zˆ rather than eˆz will remind us that\nwe are thinking about the (uˆ+, uˆ-, zˆ) basis, rather than the (eˆx, eˆy, eˆz) basis.]\nA rank ltensor can be constructed from zˆ simply by taking the product zˆi1zˆi2 . . . zˆil.\nThis is symmetric, and can be made traceless by extracting the traceless part. Extracting\nthe traceless part means subtracting terms proportional to one or more Kronecker δ-\nfunctions in such a way that the result is traceless. It gets rather complicated to describe\nhow this can be done for a general symmetric tensor of arbitrary rank, so I will just\nillustrate it by example. Tensors of rank 0 and 1 (i.e., scalars and vectors) are by definition\ntraceless. I will use curly brackets { . . .} to denote the traceless symmetric part of . . ..\nThus,\n{ 1 } = 1 ,\n(9.36)\n{ zˆi } = ˆzi .\nBut for rank 2, the trace of zˆizˆj is equal to zˆizˆi = ˆz · zˆ = 1. But we can subtract a\nconstant times δij so that the result is traceless:\n{ zˆizˆj } = ˆzizˆj -1δij .\n(9.37)\nThe coefficient is 1/3, because the trace of δij is\nδii = 3 .\n(9.38)\n\n8.07 LECTURE NOTES 9, FALL 2012\np. 10\nFor rank 3, zˆizˆjzˆk has trace zˆizˆizˆk = ˆzk, but we can make it traceless with a subtraction\n{ zˆizˆjzˆk } = ˆzizˆjzˆk -1\n\nzˆiδjk + ˆzjδik + ˆzkδij\n\n.\n(9.39)\nThe subtraction must of course be symmetrized, as shown, since we are trying to construct\na traceless symmetric tensor.\nTo verify that 1/5 is the right coefficient to make the\nexpression traceless, we can take its trace. Since it is symmetric we can sum over any\npair of indices. I will choose to sum over i and j:\nδij{ zˆizˆjzˆk } = ˆzizˆizˆk -1\nzi\n5 ˆ δik + ˆziδik + ˆzkδii\n(9.40)\n= ˆzk -1(ˆzk + ˆzk + 3zˆk) = 0 .\n\nFor rank 4 there is the option of subtracting terms with either one or two Kronecker\nδ-functions, and both are needed to give a traceless result. We can start with arbitrary\ncoefficients, and see what they have to be:\n{ zˆizˆjzˆkzˆm } = ˆzizˆjzˆkzˆm + c1\n\nzˆizˆjδkm + ˆzizˆkδmj + ˆzizˆmδjk + ˆzjzˆkδim\n(9.41)\n+ ˆzjzˆmδik + ˆzkzˆmδij\n\n+ c2\n\nδijδkm + δikδjm + δimδjk\n.\nWithin each set of parentheses, the terms are chosen to make the expressi\n\non symmetric\nin i, j, k, and m. If we calculate the trace over i and j, we find\nδij{ zˆizˆjzˆkzˆm } = ˆzkzˆm + c1\n\nδkm + ˆzkzˆm + ˆzkzˆm + ˆzkzˆm\n+ ˆzkzˆm + 3zˆkzˆm\n\n+ c2\n\n3δkm + δkm + δkm\n(9.42)\n= 1 + 7c1 zˆkzˆm + c1 + 5c2 δkm .\n\nFor the expression to vanish fo\n\nr all k an\n\nd m, the\n\ntwo terms\n\nmust vanish separately, so\nc1 = -1/7 and c2 = 1/35. Thus,\n{ zˆ\nizˆjzˆkzˆm } = ˆzizˆjzˆkzˆm -\n\nzˆizˆjδkm + ˆzizˆkδmj + ˆzizˆmδjk + ˆzjzˆkδim\n(9.43)\n+ ˆzjzˆmδik + ˆzkzˆmδij\n\n+ 1 δijδkm\nδikδjm\nδimδjk\n.\n\n+\n+\n\nIt can be shown that any traceless symmetric tensor of rank lthat is invariant\nunder rotations about the z-axis is proportional to { zˆi1 . . . zˆil}. (To see this, note that\nin Lecture Notes 8 we construct a complete (2l+ 1)-dimensional basis for the traceless\nsymmetry tensors of rank l. They depend on the azimuthal angle φ as zm(φ) ≡eimφ,\nwith m taking integer values from -lto l. Since these functions of φ are orthogonal in\n\n8.07 LECTURE NOTES 9, FALL 2012\np. 11\nthe sense that\n2π zm\n∗(φ)zm\n′\n(φ) dφ = 2πδm′m, any traceless symmetric tensor of rank l\nthat is independent of φ must proportional to the m = 0 basis tensor.) Since Eq. (9.10)\ntells us how to expand an arbitrary function of θ and φ in terms of traceless symmetric\ntensors, we can now say that functions of θ alone (i.e., azimuthally symmetric functions\nof nˆ) can be expanded as\nF(θ) = c0 + c1{ zˆi }nˆi + c2{ zˆizˆj } nˆinˆj + . . . + cl{ zˆi1 . . . zˆil} nˆi1 . . .nˆil+ . . . ,\n(9.44)\nwhere the cl's are constants. This corresponds to what is standardly called an expansion\nin Legendre polynomials. In Lecture Notes 8 I show exactly how to relate these terms to\nthe standard conventions for normalizing the Legendre polynomials, but we can see here\nexactly what these functions are. Using zˆ · nˆ = cos θ, we have\n{ 1 } = 1\n{ zˆi } nˆi = cos θ\n{ zˆ zˆj } nˆ\ni\ninˆj = cos θ -3\n(9.45)\n{ zˆizˆjzˆk } nˆinˆjnˆk = cos3 θ -\ncos θ\n{ zˆizˆjzˆkzˆm } nˆ nˆ\ni\njnˆknˆm = cos θ -\ncos θ +\n.\nUp to a normalization convention described in Lecture Notes 8, these are the Legendre\npolynomials Pl(cos θ).\n7. THE MULTIPOLE EXPANSION:\nThe most general solution to Laplace's equation, in spherical coordinates, was given\nas Eq. (9.32). We now wish to apply that result to a common situation: suppose we have\na charged object, and we wish to describe the potential outside of the object. Let's say for\ndefiniteness that the charge of the object is entirely contained within a sphere of radius\nR, centered at the origin. In that case Laplace's equation will hold for all r > R, so there\nshould be a solution of the form of Eq. (9.32) that is valid throughout this region. At\ninfinity the potential of a localized charge distribution will always approach a constant,\nwhich we can take to be zero, we can see that the Alcoefficients that appear in Eq. (9.32)\nmust all vanish. The Blfactors can be absorbed into the definition of\n(l)\nCi ...i , so we can\nwrite the expansion as\nl\ninf\nΦ(\n(l)\nr) =\n\nC\nrl+1\ni1...i n\nlˆi1 . . . nˆil.\n(9.46)\nl=0\n\n8.07 LECTURE NOTES 9, FALL 2012\np. 12\nSince each successive term comes with an extra factor of 1/r, at large distances the sum\nis dominated by the first term or maybe the first few terms. All the information about\nthe charge distribution of the object is contained in the\n(l)\nCi1...il, so knowledge of the first\nfew\n(l)\nCi\nthe ob\n1...ilis enough to describe the field at large distances, no matter how complicated\nject.\nThe first few terms of this series have special names: the l= 0 term is the monopole\nterm, the l= 1 term is the dipole, the l= 2 term is the quadrupole, and the l= 3 term\nis the octupole.\nIf we want to calculate the\n(l)\nCi1...ilin terms of the charge distribution, we can start\nwith the general equation for the potential of an arbitrary charge distribution:\nρ(r ′)\nV (r) = 4πε0\n\nd3x .\n(9.47)\n|r -r ′|\nThe multipole expansion can then be derived by expanding 1/ |r -r ′| in a power series\nin r ′.\nI'll begin by doing it as Griffiths does, which gives the simplest -- but not the most\nuseful -- form of the multipole expansion. Griffiths rewrote the denominator as\n=\n= √\n,\n(9.48)\n|r -r ′|\n\n|\n2 +\n|2 -2 ·\nr2 + r′2 -2rr′ cos\n|\n|\nθ\nr\nr\nr\nr\n′\n′\n′\nwhere r and r′ are the lengths of the vectors r and r ′, respectively, and θ is the angle\nbetween these vectors.\nNext he used the fact that the Legendre polynomials can be\ndefined by the generating function\ng(x, λ) = √\n,\n(9.49)\n1 + λ2 -2λx\nwhich means that the Legendre polynomials Pl(x) can be obtained by expanding g(x, λ)\nin a power series in λ\ninf\ng(x, λ) = √\n=\nλlP\n1 +\n-2\n\nl(x) .\n(9.50)\nλ2\nλx\nl=0\nEq. (9.50) is sometimes taken as the definition of the Legendre polynomials, and some-\ntimes it is derived from another definition. In any case, if we accept Eq.

(9.47), we find\ninf\n′l\nV (r) = 4\n\nr ρ(r ′)P\nl(cos θ′) d x .\n(9.52)\nπε\nl\nr +1\nl=0\nThis is the easiest way that I know to show that there is an expansion of V (r) in powers of\n1/r, but the complication is that cos θ′ appears inside the integral. If we could implement\nEq. (9.46), we would be able to calculate (or maybe measure) a small number of the\nquantities\n(l)\nCi1...il, and then we would be able to evaluate V (r) at large distances in any\ndirection. To use Eq. (9.52) directly, however, one would have to repeat the integration\nfor every direction of r. Griffiths works around this problem by massaging the formula\nto extract the monopole and dipole terms, and in Problem 3 of Problem Set 5 you had\nthe opportunity to carry this out for the quadrupole and octupole terms.\nThe standard method of \"improving\" Eq. (9.52) is to use spherical harmonics, but\nhere I will derive the equivalent relations using the traceless symmetric tensor approach.\nInstead of expanding 1/ |r -r ′| in powers of r′, we will think of it as a function of\nthree variables -- the components r ′\ni of r ′, and we will expand it as a Taylor series in 3\nvariables. To make the formalism clear, I will define the function\nf(r ′) ≡\n.\n(9.53)\n|r -r ′|\nThe function can then be expanded in a power series using the standard multi-variable\nTaylor expansion:\n∂f\n∂2f\nf(r ′) = f(0) +\n\nx′\ni +\nx′\nix′ + . . . ,\n(9.54)\n∂x′\ni\n∂x ∂x\nj\nr ′=0\n2!\ni\n′\n′\nj\n\nr ′=0\nwhere the repeated indices are summed. To separate the\n\nangular behavior, we write\nx′\ni = r′nˆ′\ni ,\n(9.55)\nso Eq. (9.54) becomes\n∂f\nr′2\n∂2f\nf(r ′) = f(0) + r′\n\nn n + . . . .\n∂x′\ni\n\nnˆi\n′ +\nˆ′ ˆ′\n(9.56)\n\n2! ∂x ∂x\nr ′=0\n′\ni\n′\nj\n\ni\nj\nr ′=0\nThe notation can now be simplified by noting that since\n\nf is a function of r -r ′, the\nderivatives with respect to x′\ni can be replaced by derivatives with respect to xi with a\nchange of sign:\n∂f\n∂\n=\n∂x′\ni\n∂x′\ni\n\n∂\n∂\n=\n=\n.\n(9.57)\n|r -r ′\n\n-\n|\n\nr ′=0\n∂xi\n\n|r -r ′|\n\n∂x\n\n-\n\nr ′=0\ni\n|r|\n\n8.07 LECTURE NOTES 9, FALL 2012\np. 14\nThis allows us to write the derivatives in the expansion (9.56) much more simply. The\nl'th derivative is found by repeating the above operation ltimes:\n∂lf\n\n∂l\nl\n= (-1)\n.\n(9.58)\n∂x′\ni . . . ∂x\n′\nilr =\n∂xi1 . . .∂xil|r\n′\n|\nCombining Eqs. (9.58) with (9.56),\n\nwe can write\ninf(\n∂\n=\n-1)lr′l\nl\nnˆ′ . . . nˆ′ .\n(9.59)\n|r -r ′|\n\nl!\n\n∂x\n. . . ∂x\n|r|\n\ni1\nil\ni1\ni\nl=0\nl\nNote that the quantity in parentheses in the equation above is traceless, because\n\n∂l\n∂\n=\n∂xi∂xi∂xi+2 . . .∂xil|r|\n\nl\n∇2\n∂xi+2 . . . ∂xil|r|\n(9.60)\n∂l\n= ∂xi+2 . . .∂xil\n∇2\n= 0 ,\n|r|\nbecause ∇2(1/|r|) = 0 except at r = 0. So we can see the traceless symmetric tensor\nformalism emerging.\nTo evaluate this quantity, we will work out the first several terms until we recognize\nthe pattern. We write\nr ≡rn ,\nˆ\n(9.61)\nand adopt the abbreviation\n∂\n∂i ≡\n.\n(9.62)\nxi\nIt is useful to start by evaluating the derivatives of the basic quantities r and nˆi:\n∂r = ∂\n/\ni(xjxj)1 2\nx\ni\n=\n(\ni\nx\nkxk)-/2∂i(xjxj) =\n2x\njδij =\n= ˆni ,\nr\nr\n(9.63)\nxj\nδij\n∂i\nj\ni\nj\ni\nij\ni\nj\nr\nr\nr2\nr\nIt is then straightforward to show that\n∂i\n= -\nnˆi ,\nr\nr2\n∂i∂j\n\nr\n\n= r3 { nˆinˆj } ,\n(9.64)\n5 3\n∂i∂j∂k\n\n=\n·\nr\n-\nn\nr\n{ nˆiˆjnˆk } ,\nnˆ = ∂\n=\nx ∂r =\nδ\nnˆ nˆ\n.\n\n-\n-\n\n8.07 LECTURE NOTES 9, FALL 2012\np. 15\nwhere { } denotes the traceless symmetric part, and the relevant cases are shown explicitly\nin Eqs. (9.36) - (9.39). It becomes clear that the general formula, which can be proven\nby induction, is\n∂l\n(-1)l(2l-1)!!\n=\n{ nˆii . . . nˆi\n∂x\nl\ni1 . . . ∂x\n\nr +1\nl\nilr\n} ,\n(9.65)\n| |\nwhere\n(2l)!\n(2l-1)!! ≡(2l-1)(2l-3)(2l-5) . . .1 =\n, with ( 1)!!\n2ll!\n-\n≡1 .\n(9.66)\nInserting this result into Eq.

(9.67), one can if one wishes drop the curly brackets around either factor (but not\nboth!).\nInserting this expression for 1/|r -r ′| into Eq.
