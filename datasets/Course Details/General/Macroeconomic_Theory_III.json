Now (1-)1 is the elasticity of intertemporal substitution\nwhile captures risk aversion. This will be important when discussing the\nresults of the problem set.\n1. In this question you are asked to proof that if {vt} is implied by {ct}, then\n{vt} is implied by {ct}. To do that we only need to verify our guess.\nAssume this is true for t + j, j > 0. Substitute in our lifetime utility and\ncheck that it also holds for time t.\nh\ni 1\n\ne\n) + (Et vt\n\n+1)\n\n=\nvt = (1\nct\n\nis constant\nh\ni 1\nh\ni 1\n\n(1\n) c\nt + (Et vt\n\n+1)\n\n= (1\n)c\nt + (Et vt\n\n+1)\n\n=\n\n= vt\nQ.E.D.\nTo proof the next part, do the same thing,\nh\ni 1\n\nvet = (1 )# + (Et#)\n=\n[(1\n)# + # ]\n\n# is constant\n\n= #[(1\n) + ]\n= #\nQ.E.D.\n\n2. Now we want to build a measure of the cost of fluctuations as the one\ndescribed in the lecture. will be our measure and tells us how much do we\n\nhave to increase the consumption of the agent every period to compensate\nhim for having variability, both because he does not like uncertainty and\nhe does not like to substitute over time. When you have a deterministic\nand constant path of consumption {c}, the ex ante lifetime utility is given\nby u(c) = (Etc)\n1 = c given the definition of u() and the second result\n\nderived in 1.The ex ante lifetime utility of (1+ )c, given our first result,\nis given by [Et{(1+ )vt(ct)}]\n1 = (1+ )[Et{vt(ct)}]\n1 = (1+ )u0. For\n\nthe individual to be indierent it has to be the case that\nu(c)\n=\nu((1 + )ct) /\nc =\n(1 +\n\n)u0 /\nc\n(1 + )\n=\n\nQ.E.D.\nu0\n3. To solve this part, write our ex post lifetime utility for all periods with\n= ,\n\nv0\n=\n[(1\n)c\n0 + (E0v1\n)]\n\nv1\n=\n[(1\n)c\n1 + (E1v2\n)]\n\n...\nSubstitute v1 in v0 to get\nh\ni 1\n\nv0 = (1 )c\n0 + {E0 [(1\n)c\n1 + (E1v2\n)] }\n\n£\n¤ 1\n= (1 )c0\n+ (1\n)E0c1\n+ 2E0v2\n\n,\n\nwhere I have used the law of iterated expectations to replace E1 with E0.If\nwe keep replacing for v2, v3, ...we get to the general expression for a given time\nt\n·\nt\n\nv0 = (1\n){c0 + E0c1 + E0v2 + ... + 1\nE0vt\n,\n\nand taking the limit when t $ 4\n\"\nA\n\n!#\n\nX\nv0 =\n(1\n) c\n0 + E0\nt c\nt\n.\n\nt=1\ngiven that < 1 and that vt is finite, which is a monotonic transformation\nof\n\nA\n!\n\nX\n\nc0\nt ct\nv0 =\n+ E0\n\n...Q.E.D.\n\nt=1\nThe intuition for this is clear. When we assume = , we no longer have a\ndistinction between the coe!cients that capture risk aversion and intertemporal\nsubstitution and thus, we are back to the standard expected utility framework\nwith CRRA preferences.\n4. Now our consumption path is deterministic and intuitively the coe!cient\nthat captures risk aversion should not play any role, lifetime utility should\nnot depend on risk aversion if there isn't any. That is the reason why,\neven without assuming = we get the same expression than before.\nAlgebraically, note that the cancel in our expression as we know that v\nis deterministic. Thus we have\n£\n¤ 1\nvt = (1 )c\nt + vt\n\n+1\n,\n\nwhich is the same expression we had in 3.(without the expectation term), so\ndoing the same steps we get to the same result,\nA\n!\n\nX\n\nc0\nt ct\nv0 =\n+\n\n.\n\nt=1\nNow we have to compute the lifetime utility for clh = {cl, ch, cl, ch, ...} and\nchl = {ch,cl, ch, cl, ch, ...}. I'll solve the first case, the second can be found fol\nlowing the same steps. From our expression we have\n£\n¡\n¢¤ 1\nv0(clh) = (1 ) c\nl + c\nh + 2 c\nl + ...\n=\n\n£\n¡\n¢¤ 1\n(1\n) c\nl + c\nh)(1 + 2 + 4 + ...\n=\n\n·\n\n(1\n)\n\n2 (cl + ch)\n= v0lh\n\nand symmetrically,\n·\n\nv0hl = (1\n)(c\nh + c\nl )\n.\n\nAs it was noticed before, the solution does not depend on because the\nconsumption path is deterministic.\nBut as we still have dierent consumption levels every period, it depends on\nthe elasticity of substitution.\nWhen we take the limit as $ 1, the intuition is clear. The individual does\nnot discount the future any more, he likes it as much as the present. So for\nhim it does not make any dierence in which order he gets the consumption\n\nlevels and thus both paths of consumption give the same level of utility. Note\nthat as we still have variability in consumption over time, the utility levels will\ndepend on the elasticity of intertemporal substitution. Algebraically, applying\nL'Hopital Rule, lim 1\n2 = lim\n1 = 1 and then\n$1 1\n\n$1\n\n·\n\nlim\nlim\n\nv0 =\nv0hl =\nv0lh =\n(ch + cl )\n...Q.E.D.\n$ 1\n$ 1\nUsing our equation for the welfare loss for c = 1\n2 (ch + cl) and u0 = v0\nobtained in 2 we get\n1 (ch + cl)\n(1 + ) = £\n¤ 1\n\n(c + c )\nh\nl\nAgain the answer does not depend on . Notice that if the individual has\n4 elasticity of intertemporal substitution ( $ 1) then there is no loss at all.\nThis is reasonable since it does not matter to him that the consumption varies\nover time. And the less willing he is to substitute over time, the bigger the loss.\nIf instead of a deterministic path we have uncertainty, the parameter will\nplay a role. This is the case when we assume that consumption path can take\nany of the two ex ante with probability 1\n2 .\n\nu0 = [E0{v0}]\n=\n\"\n# 1\nμ\n¶\nμ\n¶\n\n(1\n)\n(1\n)\n\n(c + c )\n+\n\n(c + c )\n.\nh\nl\nl\nh\n\nWhen $ 1 is totally indierent between the two paths. So u0 won't\ndepend on as he is not facing any uncertainty. Algebraically\n\"\n# 1\nμ\n¶\nμ\n¶\n\nlim\n\nu0 =\n(ch + cl )\n+\n(cl + ch)\n=\n$ 1\n·\n\n2(ch + cl )\n.\n5. Now we have the opposite case. Once uncertainty is resolved in time 0,\nwe have a deterministic and constant path of consumption. Intuitively, ex\nante lifetime utility should not depend on the elasticity of intertemporal\nsubstitution but should depend on risk aversion as we have ex ante uncer\ntainty. And it shouldn't depend on the discount factor as present is the\nsame than future. Algebraically, we now that v0h and v0l are, using the\nresult derived in the first part of the exercise,\nv0h = ch and v0l = cl.\nThis implies\n\nu0 = [E0{v0}] =\n·\n(c\nh + c\nl )\n\n6. Now we have both uncertainty and variability over time and thus, lifetime\nutility should depend on both parameters, and . Write the expression\nfor u0,\n\nu0\n=\n[E0{v0}] =\n·\nv0(cl) + v0(ch)\n\n=\n·\n2 {(1 )c\nl + (E0v1\n) } + 2 {(1 )c\nh + (E0v1\n) }\n,\nwhere I used the expression for v0 given initially. Given that consumption\nis i.i.d. we have that\n\n(E0v1\n) = (E1v1\n)\n= u1\nBecause of stationary of the process and infinite horizon, the problem is the\nsame in 0 and 1, i.e. u0 = u1.\nThus we can write\n\nu0 =\n·\n2 {(1 )cl + u0} + 2 {(1 )ch + u0}\n...Q.E.D.\nAnd as argued before, it depends on both parameters because the individual\nfaces both uncertainty and fluctuations in consumption.\n7. Solving with excel or mathlab, we obtain the following results for :\n\\\n.5\n-1\n\n0.0000%\n0.0096%\n0.0384%\n.5\n0.0004\n0.0100\n0.0388%\n-1\n0.0016\n0.0112%\n0.0400%\nWhen the agent is risk neutral ( = 1) and has a elasticity of intertemporal\nsubstitution of infinite ( = 1), there is no loss. for a given , the more risk\navert (smaller ), the bigger the loss. And for a given , the less willing to\nsubstitute, the bigger the loss. Notice that the results vary more with , that is,\nthe consumer is aected more by variability on the path of consumption than\nfor uncertainty when the tolerance to any of those things is small."

Think of this equation as defining a stochastic process for {vt} given\na stochastic process for {ct}. In any period t before the resolution of current consumption\nwe can define lifetime utility by ut as:\nut = (Etvt\nα)\nα\n(2)\n!# 1\nρ\n(a) Show that if {vt} is implied by {ct} using (1) then {λvt} is implied by {λct} using (1)\nfor any λ > 0. Show that if ct = ψ for some constant ψ then vt and ut are also constant\nand equal to ψ. 1\n(b) For any stationary process c = {ct} , with associated utility u0, let c denote the deter\nministic and constant sequence of consumption (Ect, Ect,\n). Define our measure of\n· · ·\nwelfare loss from the variability of {ct} to be that constant percentage increase, η, in\nthe process c that is required to make the individual indifferent between (1 + η) c and\nc .\nUse your results in (a) to show that:\nEct\n1 + η = u0\n(c) Show that if α = ρ then:\nρ\ninf\nβt ρ\n0 + E0\nX\nc\n(1 - β)\n(3)\nv0 =\nc\nt\nt=1\nwhich is just a monotonic transformation of the more familiar\nc ρ\ninf\nc ρ\n0 + E0\nX\nβt\nt\nρ\nρ\nt=1\nutility specification.\n1Given these results we could say that vt (ut) represents the \"certainty equivalent constant consumption\"\nfrom t on, after (before) the resolution of time t consumption.\n\n(d)\n(i) Show that if {ct} is deterministic then (3) holds (without the need for the ex\npectation operator of course). Use this to compute the value of utility ob\ntained if clh = (cl, ch, cl, ch, ...), denote this lifetime utility by v0,l. and v0,h,\nchl = (ch, cl, ch, cl, ...) . How does your answer depend on the parameters α and ρ?\n(ii) It is useful to think of the limit as β\n1. Show that v0,h and v0,l converge to the\n→\nα\nsame value. What is the intuition for this? Compute the welfare loss as a fraction\nof the constant consumption stream that equals the average c ≡ 1\n2 ch + 1\n2 cl. How\ndoes your answer depend on the parameters α and ρ?\n(iii) Compute the value of u0 if the sequences clh and chl occur with probability 1/2\n(which is revealed at the beginning of period 0) as β\n1. This should be very\n→\neasy given your answer to (ii). How does your answer depend on the parameters\nα and ρ?\n(e) (note: we no longer work with the limit β\n1 here, we are back to β bounded away\n→\nfrom 1) Find an expression for utility, u0, when {ct} is such that c = (ch, ch, ...) with\nprobability 1/2 and c = (cl, cl, ...) with probability 1/2. How does your answer depend\non the parameters α, ρ?\n(f) Let ct be i.i.d. distributed over time with outcomes cl and ch each with probability\n1/2. Combine (1) and (2) and the fact that with i.i.d. consumption ut = u0 to show\nthat u0 must solve of the form:\n·1\nα\nα\nρ + βuρ\n0]\nρ + βuρ\n0]\n[(1 - β) c\n[(1 - β) c\n(4)\nρ +\nρ\nu0 =\nl\nh\nThink of this equation as implicitly defining u0 (whether it does so uniquely is an\ninteresting question I am not asking). Why does this equation involve both of the\nparameters α and ρ?\n(g) Use the equation (4) found in part (f) to compute u0 and then the welfare loss, η, as\ndefined in (b) of consuming the i.i.d. sequence described in (f).\nSet the rest of the parameters in all cases as follows: β = .95 and log ch = 1.02 and\nlog cl = 0.98. Using a computer find the welfare loss for all nine combinations of the\nparameters: α = 1, 1/2, -1 and ρ = 1, 1/2, -1. Display your results for η on a table.\nHint. To solve you can iterate on this equation: plug in a good initial guess (such\nas u0 = 1) on the right hand side and compute the LHS, then use this new number\non the right hand side. Repeat this process until the numbers converge (when there\nabsolute value difference is less than 10-10 say). You can work with any program for\nthis: Matlab or Excel will certainly do."

Let utility for individual i be given by\nPinf βt\ni (ct)\nE\nt=0\nu\nwhich under our assumption on uncertainty is,\ninf\n\nβt u ct s t\nPr s t .\nt=0\nst\nParts (a) and (b) are just a refresher from the lectures.\n(a) Assume that there is no aggregate savings technology, that the state of nature is\nobservable and that there are no commitment problems.\nWrite out the Pareto problem for given Pareto weights {λi}i∈I. Show that at the optimum\nconsumption for individual i, ci\nt (st) , can be written as depending only on aggregate income\nin that period - once we control for Yt (st) consumption does not depend additionally on st .\n(b) We now generalize the previous result. Assume there is a \"storage technology\": if in\nperiod t -1 an amount St (st-1) ≥ 0 was put aside for storage, then in period t an amount\n(1 + rt (st)) St (st-1) is available (for consumption or storage) in addition to any current\nincome Yt (st). Show that a similar result as in (a) holds but that now we must condition on\ntotal consumption C (st) ≡ P\ni∈I ci\nt (st). (note that we impose the non-negativity constraint\non storage, thus our result in a can be thought as a special case where rt ≡ 0 so that at the\noptimum St = 0 and thus Ct = Yt).\n(c) Let the utility function be of the CARA form\n-1\n\nu i (c) = γi exp -γi c\nshow that consumption takes the form: ct\ni = aiCt + bi where ai and bi are constants and\nai = 1 and\nbi = 0. How does the distribution of γi affect ai and bi? How does the\ndistribution of Pareto weights λi affect ai and bi?\n1 Note that st summarizes the entire distribution of current income and possibly contains additional\ninformation, e.g. forecasts of future income.\n\nZ\nZ\n(d) Let the utility function be of the CRRA form\n1-σ\nu i (c) = c\n1 -σ\nwhere the risk aversion σ is assumed to be the same for all individuals. Show that consump\ntion takes the form ci\nt = αiCt with the constants αi satisfying P\ni∈I αi = 1. How do the\nconstants αi depend on the Pareto weights λi?\nRisk Sharing Productivity: Consumption and Labor\nConsider a social planner who maximizes the utility of a continuum of agents of measure\none ex-ante identical, with preferences over consumption and leisure\nu (c, l)\nwhere we assume that utility function u (.) is strictly concave, continuously differentiable\nand increasing in both its arguments.\nAgents are heterogeneous ex-post according to their productivity. They draw one non\nnegative productivity parameter ω ∈ Ω independently from a known continuous distribution\nfunction F. We assume that the support Ω = [ωmin, ωmax] is compact and the density function\ndensity function f (ω) is bounded above and bounded away from zero.\nThe resource constraint in this economy is\nc(ω)f(ω)dω ≤\n(1 -l(ω))ωf(ω)dω + e\nfor some endowment e ≥ 0.\nLet us assume that agents' productivity is ex-post publicly observable, so that consump\ntion and leisure can be conditioned on their ability, i.e. c (ω) and l (ω).\n(a) Write down the social planner problem, noting that, given that the agents are a\ncontinuum of measure one, by the law of large number, the ex-ante probability coincides\nwith the ex-post distribution.\n(b) Show that, under the given assumptions, leisure is a decreasing function of the pro\nductivity parameter ω. Discuss.\n(c) Show that the dependence of consumption on the productivity parameters depends on\nthe assumption on the sign of the cross-derivative ucl (short notation for ∂2u(.) ). Comment.\n∂c∂l\n(d) Show that assuming that leisure is a normal good is sufficient (for any sign of ucl) to\nhave the utility function decreasing in the productivity. Discuss the role of risk sharing.\n\n(e) Assume now that agents' productivity is not ex-post observable anymore. Given your\nresult in the previous point, is the previous allocation implementable? Comment.\nOverlapping Generations\nIn this problem we study an overlapping generations model under two market interpretations\nand isolate the conditions for Pareto optimality.\nAll individuals live for only two periods. Generation t (denoted by the superscript) has\nutility function:\nu c t\nt + βu c t\nt+1\nwhere u : R+ → R is strictly concave and increasing in the single consumption good c.\nIndividuals are endowed with one unit of labor in the first period of their lives and supply\nit inelastically. Capital is owned by individuals and rented out to firms. Competitive firms\nrent capital and labor at prices rt and wt (in terms of time t consumption goods). At time\nzero all initial capital is held by the old (i.e. generation t = -1).\nThe resource constraint is,\nkt+1 + ct\nt + ct\nt-1 ≤ F (kt, 1) + (1 -δ) kt,\nwhere F is a constant returns to scale (CRS) production function and δ ∈ (0, 1].\n(a) Sequential Trade. Consider the sequential competitive market arrangement where\nindividuals in generation t face the budget constraints,\nct\nt + kt+1 =\nwt\nct\nt\n+1 =\nRt+1kt+1\nwith Rt ≡ (1 -δ + rt).\nGiven k0, define a competitive equilibrium for this market arrangement for c0\nt ,\nct\nt, ct\nt+1 , kt+1\ninf\nt=0\nand prices {rt, wt}inf\nt=0.\n(b) Time-0 trade. Now consider the complete market arrangement where we imagine all\ngenerations (the born and yet unborn) and firms meeting at time zero and competitively\ntrading in claims for future consumption, labor and capital. We generalize the notation and\nspecialize it to interpret our overlapping generations model.\n\nX X\nX\nX\nGeneration t faces the budget constraint:\ninf\ninf\nX\n\nX\nt\nqs c s\nt + ks\nt\n+1 -Rsks\nt\n≤\nqs\n0 wsn s + R0k 0\nt\ns=0\ns=0\nwhere we have normalize q0\n0 = 1 and Rs is as before.\nNotation: nt\ns and k 0\nt represent endowment of labor in period s and initial capital owned\ns\ns\n=\nby generation t. Thus, in our OLG model: nt = 1 for s = t and nt = 0 for s = t; k 0\n-1\nk0\nand k 0\ns = 0 for s\n-1.\n=\nThink of each generation-t as having a utility function U t defined over the entire con-\nt\nt\nt\nt\nsumption stream {cs}inf\ns=0. Of course, in our OLG model: U t ({cs}inf\ns=0) ≡ u (ct) + βu\n\nct+1\n\n.\n0 t\nt\n\ninf\n0 inf\nDefine an equilibrium for ct ,\nct, ct+1 , kt+1 t=0 and prices {qt }t=0 and {rt, wt}inf\nt=0 using\nthe standard Walrasian setup.\nShow that equilibria must satisfy the arbitrage condition: qt\n0/qt\n+1 = Rt+1. Argue that\nthe sequential market equilibrium in part (a) is a time-0 market equilibrium, as outlined\nhere, for appropriately chosen prices {qt\n0}.\n(c) Consider the special case of log utility, u (c) = log c, and Cobb-Douglas production\nfunction F (nt, kt) = Akt\nαn 1\nt\n-α . Characterize the entire equilibrium allocation c0\nt ,\n\nct\nt, ct\nt+1\n\n, kt+1\ninf\nt=0\nand prices {rt, wt}inf\nt=0. Solve for the steady state level of capital kss.\nShow that the equilibrium is not Pareto efficient if steady state capital higher than the\ngolden rule kg = arg maxk{F(k, 1) -δk}. Show that there are parameters values for which\nkg < kss.\n(Hint: construct an allocation that increases everyone's consumption for all periods t\nhigh enough such that at the original equilibrium allocation capital remains higher than the\ngolden rule, i.e. ks > kg for s ≥ t).\n(d) In terms of the time-0, complete-market arrangement. Why does the First Welfare\nTheorem fail to apply? (Hint: argue that the condition\ninf\ninf\nqt\n0 wtn s\nt < inf\ns=0 t=0\nis necessary for the proof of the first welfare theorem and that it is not satisfied here). Show\nthat the welfare theorem does apply if kss ≤ kg.\n(e) The previous points show that if kss ≤ kg then there are Pareto weights {λt} for\ngenerations such that the equilibrium allocation maximizes:\ninf\ninf\nλt\n\nu\n\nc t\nt\n\n+ βu\n\nc t\nt+1\n\n+ λ-1βu\n\nc 0\n\n=\n\nλtu\n\nc t\nt\n\n+ λt-1βu\n\nc t\nt\n-1\nt=0\nt=0\n\nX\nsubject to ct\nt + ct\nt-1 + kt+1 ≤ F (kt, 1) + (1 -δ) kt.\nShow that if k0 = kss then λt/λt-1 = α for some α < 1.\n(f) Show that,\nU (C)\n≡\nmax [αu (cy) + βu (c o)] = φu (C)\ns.t. cy + c o = C\nfor some φ > 0.\nUse this and the results above to show that when kss ≤ kg the equilibrium allocation\nwith k0 = kss solves the representative agent problem,\ninf\nmax\nαt u(Ct)\nC,k′\nt=0\nsubject to, Ct + kt+1 ≤ F(kt, 1) + (1 -δ) kt and k0 = kss.\nHow does α compare to β?"

Assume the standard intertemporal budget constraint\nγ\nAt+1 = (1 + r) (At + yt - ct) .\n(note: we do not necessarily impose β (1 + r) = 1 here). Assume that yt is i.i.d. across time\nand agents. Let yt = y + εt where εt is i.i.d. and Et-1εt = 0. We do not impose a borrowing\nconstraint on this problem, At can take any value, although a no-Ponzi condition should be\nthought as being implicitly imposed for the problem to be well defined (you will not have to\nthink about this no-Ponzi condition explicitly for solving the problem though).\n(a) Show that the consumption function,\nr\n·\nct =\nAt + yt + y - π (r, γ)\n1 + r\nr\nfor some π (r, γ) implies,\nr\nΔct =\n[yt - y ] + rπ (r, γ)\n1 + r\n[note that the functional form of the consumption function, as a function of At and current\nand expected income, is like the CEQ-PIH except for the constant π (r, γ)]\n(b) Use the Euler equation and your results in (a) to show that the consumption function\nin (a) is optimal for some π (hint: use the Euler equation to guess and verify the optimality\nof the above consumption function) which depends on r and the distribution of ε.\n(c) Show that π (r, γ) > 0 if r is such that β (1 + r) = 1. Compare this to the CEQ-PIH\ncase. How does π depend on the uncertainty in yt?\n(d) Assume there is a constant measure 1 of individuals in the population. Argue that\nfor aggregate consumption and assets to be constant and finite in the long run (in the limit\nas t\nwe require that π (r, γ) = 0. What does this imply about average long-run\n→inf)\nasset holdings as a function of r and γ(denote this by A (r, γ))? What is happening to the\ncross-section of consumption? Does this distribution converge?\n(e) Use your results in (d) to compute the equilibrium interest rate re as a function of γ for\nβ = .97, y = 1. Assume ε distributed normal with mean zero and standard deviation equal\n\nto σ (this distributional assumption allows you to find an explicit expression for E exp (-ε)).\nCompute re for two cases σ = 0.2 and 0.4 , fixing γ =1. Compare this to the interest rate\nthat prevails without uncertainty.\n(f) Briefly discuss how you would think of calibrating γ if you really believed that pref\nerences are CRRA c1-σ/ (1 - σ) for some known value of σ, but you want to work with this\nmodel as an approximation (because of its analytical tractability).\nSpeculate on whether this is likely to be a good approximation for learning about re .\nCan this be a good approximation for learning about the long-run (invariant) distribution\nof asset holdings?\nIncome Fluctuation Problem - Numerical Computa\ntion\nThis exercise asks you to compute numerically an income fluctuations problem. The problem\nis\ninf\nct\n1-σ\nmax E0\nX\nβt\nt=0\n1 - σ\nsubject to:\nxt+1 = (1 + r) (xt - ct) + yt+1\nwhere xt represents \"cash in hand\" and yt labor income. Consider the following two alter\nnative income processes:\nProcess I yt is assumed to be i.i.d. with only two possible realizations yl = 1.7w and\nyh = .5w with 1/2 probability each.\nProcess II yt follows a two-state Markov process with transition matrix\n· πHH πHL\n\nΠ =\nπLH\nπLL\nwhere again yl = 1.7w and yh = .5w and πHH = .9 and πLL = .5.\nSet β = .97, r = 2% and w = 1.\nYou are given the basic matlab codes that should allow you to understand how to compute\nthe solution to the income fluctuation problem. In fact you are given two codes, one that\nuses the simple grid method (explained in SL ch.4) and the other which uses splines which\nsometimes is more efficient, but you are not required to look at it. You are supposed to\nmodify the simple code in order to match the new parameters and the two different income\nprocesses. You are required to hand in your code.\nPerform all calculations below for both the alternative income processes and\nfor σ = .8 and σ = 1.8.\nWe solve this problem by iterating on the Bellman equation\n(\n((1 + r) a + y - a )1-σ\n)\nv (a, y) = max\n+ βE [v (a0, y0) y]\na≥0\n1 - σ\n|\n\nNotice that in the i.i.d. we could have simplified the problem by reducing the state at cash-\nin-hand only, but since we are working also with a permanent process for income, we need a\ntwo dimensional state vector anyway.\n(a) Solve the optimal consumption problem obtaining the consumption function c (x) .\nPlot the function for consumption, asset holdings a0 (z) = z - c (z) , and cash-in-hand for to\nmorrow (for both realizations of tomorrow's income shock), that is, z0 (a, y0) = (1 + r) a0 (z)+\ny0 for both possible values of y0. How do your results differ between the two alternative in\ncome processes?\n(b) Use this policy function together with random shocks to simulate the evolution of\ncash-in-hand, income, consumption and assets for 200 periods. Plot the simulated series for\nconsumption, income and assets. Is consumption smoother than income? How high are asset\nholdings? For what fraction of periods is the agent liquidity constrained (i.e. xt - ct = 0)?\nHow do your results depend on σ? Compare the two alternative income processes\n(c) Compute a longer simulation (around 11001 periods), throw away the first 1001\nperiods (that is, from t = 0 to t = 1000 included) and calculate the average asset holdings\nwith the remaining periods. That is, based on the simulated sequence for {zt} 11000 compute\nP11000 a (zt) where a (z) is the policy function found in a.\nt=0\nt=1001\n(d) (Carroll, 1997) Modify the income process to have the following characteristic: there\nis a small probability π of income being zero. If this event does not occur income is drawn\nfrom the same distribution as before.\nArgue that, with the preferences above, the borrowing constraint will never bind: we\nalways have at = xt - ct > 0 (you do not have to compute. If we allow for some borrowing,\nso that we replace the constraint at ≥ 0 with at ≡ xt - ct ≥-b for some positive b > 0,\nargue that this condition will never bind and that in fact at > 0.\n(e) Now you will compute the equilibrium for this model as in Aiyagari (1994). Using\nthe Cobb-Douglas technology F (K, L) = KαL1-α solve the following system for K (r) and\nw (r):\nr = Fk (K, 1) - δ\n(1)\nw = FL (K, 1)\nHere K (r) and w (r) represent the level of capital demanded by firms and the associated\nwage if the interest rate at a steady state were equal to r and labor supply and demand are\nequal.\nFor any proposed value of r (equivalently one can propose a value for K and obtain the\nimplied proposed r using (1)) we can use the implied value for the wage w (r) and solve the\nindividual's income fluctuations problem given r and w (r). Then using the method in (c) we\ncan calculate the average asset holdings, denote this by A (r). Think of A (r) as representing\nthe steady state supply of capital by individuals when the interest rate equals to r and the\nwage is w (r).\nWe are looking for a value for r such that K (r) = A (r), i.e. that the quantity demanded\nand supplied of capital at a steady state are equal. Using α = .33, δ = 8% and the parameters\ngiven above plot A (r) against K (r) by computing A (r) for several values of r (pick values\nin the interval 0 ≤ r < 1/β - 1). Find the value of r and K at which both curves intersect."

The issue\nturns out to be quantitative in the sense that to match the equity premium\nthat emerges form the data we need a γ much higher than how it seems to be\nfrom empirical studies. This comes from the fact that the covariance term is\nbounded by the variance of consumption. The standard model implies that\nwhat matters is the variance of aggregate consumption, but if we introduce\n\nidiosyncratic shocks as in this exercise we can take into account the fact that\nconsumption is much more volatile. Note that from part (c) we can express\nour Euler Equation as observationally equivalent to the standard one, where\nthe new parameters are γˆ and βˆ. And note that for B > 0 and A > 0 we have\nthat γ < γˆ and β < βˆ, which both make the premium larger! In particular,\nthe usual Mehra and Prescott calculation now implies that what is required\nto be very high to match the data is now γˆ which allows for some B to have\na much slower γ since\nγˆ = γ + γ (1 + γ) B\nProblems\n\nThere is an handout for this in my mail box in front of the office.\nProblem\n\n3.1\nPart (a)\nLet us define the expected profits of the firm if it undertakes the investment\nin period 1 Π (1) and the expected profits of the firm if it does not undertake\nthe investment Π (0). Then we have\nΠ (1) = π1 + E (π2) - I\nand\nΠ (0) = 0\nIt is then clear that the firm will prefer to undertake investment at period 1\nthan not to undertake it iff Π (1) > Π (0), i.e.\nπ1 + E (π2) > I\n3.2\nPart (b)\nLet us define the expected profits of the firm if it undertakes the investment\nin period 2 Π (2).

Let utility take the form u (c) = c1-σ/ (1 - σ) show that if σ is sufficiently\nclose to 0 full risk is not feasible.\n(e) If full risk sharing is not attainable we are interested in the best allocation that is feasible.\nUsing your results from part (b) show that if (5) is not satisfied the best symmetric allocation\nsatisfies\nc + c = e\nω\n£\nu\n¡\nc 1¢\n- u\n¡\ny 1¢¤\n+ (1 - ω)\n£\nu\n¡\nc 2¢\n- u\n¡\ny 2¢¤\n= 0\nand y2 ≤ c2 ≤ c1 ≤ y1 (i.e. satisfies the above two equations and has less variability than\nautarky).\n(f) Here we compute numerically the optimal allocation for the case where the utility function\nis of the CRRA form: u (c) = c1-σ/ (1 - σ).\nUse the following parameters1 β = .65, p = 0.75, y1 = 0.641 and y2 = 0.359. Plot the\noptimal c1 and c2 as functions of σ for the range σ ∈ [1, 5] (i.e. use a grid over σ with enough\npoints between 1 and 5) 2 .\nInvestment with Fixed Costs\nConsider the following problem of a firm under uncertainty in discrete time. At time t\ncurrent profits net of user costs of capital are given by π (kt, zt) where zt ∈ Z is the current\nshock to profits and kt is the amount of capital used during period t. The function π (k, z)\nis assumed to be strictly concave in k. Assume zt follows a Markov process.\nAt the beginning of the period the current shock zt is realized and the firm observes it.\n1These parameters imply a standard deviation for log-output of .29 and a first-order autocorrelation of\n.5, matching findings by Heaton and Lucas (1996) using the PSID.\n2Hint: Make sure you first check for perfect risk sharing. If full risk sharing is available take that\nallocation. Otherwise compute the allocation that satisfies the requirements in part (e), which may imply\nautarky or some insurance (watch out: do not compute an allocation with more variability than autarky!).\n\nThe firm then decides whether or not to adjust its capital stock.\nIf the firm decides not to adjust its capital then its capital remains at the previous level\nkt-1 - we assume no depreciation. If instead the firm chooses to adjust its capital then it\npays a fixed cost c (zt) and selects a new capital level kt. The costs may depend on the shock\nzt but do not depend on the new level of capital kt chosen.\nThe firms objective is to maximize expected discounted profits net of any costs incurred\nfor changing its capital stock. The firm discounts profits using a constant interest rate r.\na. Argue that kt-1, zt is the relevant state variable for a firm trying to decide whether or\nnot to adjust capital. Set up the Bellman equation for the value of the firm v (k-, z) where\nk\nrepresents the previous period's capital stock and z represents the current shock.\n-\nb. Use your Bellman equation from (a) to argue that the optimal policy can be summa\nrized by a region of inaction K (z) and an optimal adjustment policy k∗ (z). For each z ∈ Z\nthe region of inaction K (z) is a subset of R+ such that adjustment occurs in the current\nperiod if and only if k- ∈/ K (z) . If adjustment occurs then the firm chooses k∗ (z) as its\nnew capital stock. (note: you are not asked to actually solve for K (z) or k∗ (z) just to show\nthat the solution takes this form).\nc. Is k∗ (z) equal to the unconstrained optimum level of capital, i.e. k∗ (z) = arg maxk π (k, z)?\nd. Can the region of inaction K (z) always be summarized by \"sS rules\", that is that\nfor each state of the world the inaction region is a single closed interval so that there exists\nfunctions k (z) and k (z) such that\nK (z) =\n(c)\nk- : k (z) ≥ k- ≥ k (z)\na\n?\nWhy or why not?\ne. Show that if the growth rate of z is i.i.d. (so that z0/z = ε i.i.d.) and π (k, z) and c (z)\nare homogenous of degree one (constant returns to scale) so that π (k, z) = sπ (k/z, 1) and\nc (z) = cs then v (k-, z) , k∗ (z) , K (z) are homogenous of degree one.\nDefine kˆ\n= k /z. What do these results imply about the region of inaction Kˆ (z) and\n-\n-\nthe optimum adjustment kˆ∗ (z) for kˆ ?\n-\nf. Consider an industry with a continuum of ex-ante identical firms facing their own\nidiosyncratic z-shocks that are independent over time and across firms. Suppose these firms\nuse sS rules for k\nas described in part (d). Briefly discuss how you would think of a steady\n-\nstate in such an economy - what kind of object is a possible equilibruim and what does it\nhave to satisfy? What determines the steady state level of aggregate investment?"

      "content": "Final Exam: Macroeconomics 14 -453\nI v h Werning\nOctober Zlst, 2003\nYou have 2 hours to complete the exam. Do all the short questions\nand choose 2 out of the 3 longer questions - do not turn in answers\nto =ore than 2 nf the longer question!\nPlease write your answer to the Shorter qnestions in the space provided\nand use your blue book to answer the 2 longer problems. Good luck!\n1 Shorter Questions (40 miliutes)\n1. True or False? Justify your answer. Consider a consumer with uncertain\nfuture income that can save at a constant interest rate T and has a concave\nutility function u (c) satisfying u\"' (c) > 0. Suppose the individual experi-\nences an unexpected windfalI increase in assets. Then due to precautionary\nsavings this consumer would save a higher fraction of this windfall than the\nCEQ-PIH ~~.l~uld\npredict.\n2. True or False? Justify your answer. Consider sunning the cross sec-\n\ntional regression:\nlogg' = aoicullog(l+rZ) +ui\nwhere gi is gross consumption growth and ri is the net interest rate between\ntwo dates for individual i. Assume net interest rates differ permanently\nacross individuals or groups because of exogenous tax differences. The hope\nis that al identifies the elasticity of substitution preference parameter, o.\nHowever, an income fluctuations model as in Aiyagari (1994) implies that\nthis regression, at a steady state, should yield a1 = 0, independently of the\nvalue 0. Thus, in this sense, estimating this equation does not identify o.\n3. Consider a representative agent endowment economy with preferences\nE C:\"=,'u\n(ct) with a stochastic endowment process { y t } . At time t the only\ninformation available is the history of income shocks.\n(a) Find a formula for the gross short term interest rate process Rt = l+rt\nin terms of the { y t } process. In general, is F& constant?\n(b) Assuming preferences are CRRA u (c) = el-\"/ (1 - o) find conditions\non the {y,} process that ensure that & is constant.\n\n(c) Suppose we attempted to test the Euler equation prediction for this\neconoiny but assumed in our calculations a constant real interest rate. That\nis, we test whether or not:\nholds for some R. Should we expect to accept or reject this equation?\n4. Suppose preferellees are given by,\nwith y < 1, and where ht is the stock of habits accumulated up to time t,\n1-6\nht = ht-1 ct-1\n(note that if consumption is constant then eventuaily & converges to this\nconstant value). Show that these preferences are cquivalent to\nas long as P, y are low enough or 6 is high enough.\n\nInvestment with Fixed Costs (40 minutes)\nConsider the following problem of a firm under uncertainty in discrete time.\nAt time t current profits net of user costs of capital are given by .rr (kt, z,)\nwhere zt E Z is the current shock to profits and kt is the amount of capital\nused during period t. The function .rr (k, z ) is assumed to be strictly concave\nin k. Assume zt follows a Mziskov process.\nAt the beginning of the period the current shock zt is realized and tlie\nfirm observes it. The firm then decides whether or not to adjust its capital\nstock.\nIf the firm decides not to adjust its capital then its cap~tal remains at the\nprevious level kt-l - we assume no depreciation. If instead the firm chooses\nto adjust its cap~tal then it pays a fixed cost c (zt) and selects a new capital\nlevel kt. The costs may depend on the shock zt but do not depend on the\nnew level of capital kt chosen.\nThe firms objective is to maximize expected discounted profits net of any\ncosts incurred for changing its capital stock. The firm discounts profits using\na constant interest rate r.\na. Argue that kt-l, st is the relevant state variable for a firm trying to\ndecide whether or not to adjust capital. Set up the Beliman equation for the\n\nvalue of the firm v (k-. z) where k- represents the previous period's capital\nstockland z represents the current shock.\nb. Use your Bellman equation from (a) to argue that the optimal policy\ncan be summarized by a region of inaction K (z) and an optimal adjustment\npolicy k* (z). For each z E Z the region of inaction K (z) is a subset of R+\nsuch that adjustment occurs in the current period if and only if k- $ K (z) .\nIf adjustment occurs then the h m chooses k\" (z) as its new capital stock.\n(note: you are not asked to actually solve for K (z) or k* (z) just to show\nthat the solution takes this form).\nc. Is k* (z) equal to the unconstrained optimum level of capital, i.e.\nk* (z) = arg ma-\nr (k, z)?\nd. Can the region of inaction I< (z) always be summarized by \"sS rules\",\nthat is that for each state of the world the inaction region is a single closed\ninterval so that there exists functions x (z) and\n(z) such that\nK (z) = {k- : x (z) 2 k- > & (z))?\nWhy or why not?\ne. Show that if the growth rate of z is i.i.d. (so that zl/z = E i.i.d.) and\nn (k, z ) and c (2) are homogenous of degree one (constant returns to scale)\nso that .rr (k, z ) = s.rr (klz, 1) and c (z) = b then v (k-, z) , k\" (z) , K (z) are\nhomogenous of degree one.\nDefine k- = k-lz. What do these results imply about the region of inac-\ntion K (z) and the optimum adjustment k (z) for k-?\nf. Consider an industry with a continuum of ex-ante identical firms facing\ntheir own idiosyncratic z-shocks that are independent over time and across\nfirms. Suppose these firms use sS rules for k- as descnbed in part (d). Briefly\ndiscuss how you would think of a steady state in such an economy - what\nkind of object is a possible equilibruim and what does it have to satisfy?\nWhat determines the steady state level of aggregate investment?\n3 The American Dream (40 minutes)\nA consumer has preferences:\n\nwhere u (c) is an increasing concave differentiable utility function over non-\ndurable consumption c. Here T represents the moment the agent buys a\nhouse - an indivisable durable good which yields a stock utility V from its\nownership. We allow \"T\n= oo\" and interpret this as never buying a house.\nThe value of a house is constant over time and equal to H > 0. The\nconsumer receives a constant labor income flow y, owns initial assets a. and\nfaces a constant interest rate r = p. We assume initially that the consumer\ncan borrow and lend freely at this interest rate.\n(a) Derive the present value budget constraint that the consumption path,\nc (t) , and the time of the house purchase, T, must satisfy.\n(b) Using the change in variables x = ePT so that x E [ O , l ] set up the\nLagrangian for the consumer's problem over s and c (t). Characterize fully\nthe optimal x E [ O , l ] and path c (t) as a function of the parameters y and\nan.\n\"\n(c) W-e now impose the following borrowing constraint: if the consumer\nbuys a house at time T then his accumulated wealth at time T must be\ngreater or equal to H. Write this constraint as an inequality involving T and\nc(t) for t < T only (as well as the parameters r, y and H). Rewrite this\nconstraint in terms of x and c (t) for t 5 T.\n(d) Using the change in variable s = e-rT set up the the consumer's\nproblem as maximizing utility subject to the present value constraint found\nin (a) and the borrowing constraint derived in (c).\nSet up the associated Lagrangian and derive the necessary first order\nconditions for x E [ O , l ] and for an interior c (t). For 0 < x < 1 be careful to\nconsider separately the f.0.c. for c (t) for (i) t < T (before buying a house);\n(ii) t 2 T (after buying the house).\n(e) Show that there is always a solution to the first order condtions with\nx = 0 and that there may be another solution with x > 0. Characterize\nthese paths as much as possible. Show that solutions with x t 0 involve a\ndiscontinuity in consumption at T. Why?\n(f) We now compare the two possible solutions to the first order conditions\nfound in (a). For some given y, let V (ao) and W (ao) denote the lifetime\nutility attained as a function of a0 of using the x = 0 plan and the x > 0\nplan (if one exists given a. and y), respectively.\nCharacterize V (ao) and W (ao) and show that there exists a cutoff level\nof initial assets a; such that V (ao) 5 W (ao) if and only if a. 1 a;. Thus,\nthe consumer buys a house eventually if a. 2 a; and never buys a house if\na0 < a: (note: aF, depends on y and may he zero).\n\n4 Hand-to-Mouth Workers and Growth\n(40 minutes)\nConsider the following variation of the standard neoclassical growth model.\nHalf of the population, the 'hand-to-mouth' consumers (type I), simply con-\nsume any labor income they earn each period - they never own any assets\nwhatsoever. The other half, the 'savers' (type 2), have preferences and choices\nas in the standard neoclassical model. There is no populatioil growth and we\nconveniently normalize the total population to be (a continuum) of size 2.\nThe preferences for the savers are standard:\nfor some p < 1, and u twice continuously differentiable, increasing and\nstrictly concave with the INADA condition lirn,,o u' (c) = oo.\nTechnology is given by the production function Y, = K;L:-*.\nLabor,\nLt, is supplied inelastically by both types of agents with total labor supply\nnormalized to 1 - the savers and the hand-to-mouth agents each supply 112\nunit. The resource constraint is,\nwhere Ct = ct + cf is aggregate consumption and c1 and cZ represents con-\nsumption of hand to mouth consumers savers, respectively.\n(a) Set up the standasd description of markets for labor and capital,\nstat,ing the budget constraints faced by savers and hand to mouth consumers,\nthe (static) problem of the firm. Define a competitive equilibrium.\n(b) Show that in equilibrium the labor income and consumption of the\nhand-to-mouth agents is a constant fraction X of output Y,. Determine A.\n(c) Argue that the competitive equilibrium is not optimal for the 'savers'\nin the following sense. It does not maximize (1) subject to, < + Kt+l =\n(1 - A) Kf+(1 - 6) Kt. Here X is the constant fraction of output that goes to\nthe hand-to-mouth agents found in (b). [Hint: compare what the competitive\nequilbrium and the above optimization imply for u' (c:)\n/put (c:+,)]\n(d) How does the steady state level of capital with hand-to-mouth work-\ners compare with the steady state level in the standasd neoclassical growth\nmodel?\n\n(e) Consider the case with u (c) = log (c) and 6 = 1. Guess and verify that\nat the equilibrium Kt-l = sK,\". Determines. [Hint: substitute this guess into\nthe relevant Euler equation and solve for s]. How does the introduction of the\nhand-to-mouth consumers affect the equilibrium dynamics of consumption,\noutput and capital in this case?"
