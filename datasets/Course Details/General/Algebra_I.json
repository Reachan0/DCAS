  "syllabus_content": "Course Meeting Times\n\nLectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session\n\nPrerequisites\n\nLinear Algebra (18.700)\n,\nAnalysis I (18.100)\n, or permission of instructor.\n\nStudents should have some familiarity with proofs. And though students need to be comfortable with matrix operations, the course won't go over the first chapter on matrices systematically. Students should plan to study this chapter on their own.\n\nTextbook\n\nArtin, M.\nAlgebra (2nd Edition)\n. Addison Wesley, 2010. ISBN: 9780132413770.\n\nDescription\n\nThis undergraduate level Algebra I course covers groups, vector spaces, linear transformations, symmetry groups, bilinear forms, and linear groups.\n\nFormat and Grading\n\nStudents are expected to prepare for each class meeting by completing the assigned readings and exercises for each topic prior to class. However, the exercises will not be turned in or graded.\n\nGrading for the course will be based on the following:\n\nACTIVITIES\n\nPERCENTAGES\n\nHomework problems\n\n25%\n\nThree quizzes (25% each)\n\n75%\n\n*Please note: the quizzes are not available for this version of the course.\n\nHomework Problems\n\nThe homework problems are the most important part of the course. Many of the problems are extensive and difficult, and require hard work. They are not meant to be completed in one sitting. Students are encouraged to get together with other students to work on these assignments. However, in the solutions, please list your collaborators at the top of your assignment.",
