  "course_name": "Introduction to Musical Composition",
  "course_description": "Through a progressive series of composition projects, students investigate the sonic organization of musical works and performances, focusing on fundamental questions of unity and variety. Aesthetic issues are considered in the pragmatic context of the instructions that composers provide to achieve a desired musical result, whether these instructions are notated in prose, as graphic images, or in symbolic notation. No formal training is required. Weekly listening, reading, and composition assignments draw on a broad range of musical styles and intellectual traditions, from various cultures and historical periods.",

  "syllabus_content": "Course Meeting Times\n\nLectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session\n\nForums and Concerts: 6 required events outside regular class times\n\nCourse Description\n\nMusic making (composing, improvising, performing, listening) is a fundamental vehicle for human expression, taking on myriad forms in different times and places. This course is principally concerned with improving access to musical creativity, with providing and enhancing tools and techniques. The focus of written assignments will be to develop musical ideas and notation methods that effectively transmit them to performers. The computer will be used as a tool to explore these and related issues.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nThere is no prerequisite for the class. All musical backgrounds are welcomed, including students without prior musical training.\n\nThis is\nnot\nthe class for you if you want to learn:\n\nHow to read music (try\n21M.051 Fundamentals of Music\n)\n\nAbout music theory (try\n21M.301 Harmony and Counterpoint I\n)\n\nHow to read and write lead sheets (try\n21M.340 Jazz Harmony and Arranging\n)\n\nWestern music literature (try\n21M.011 Introduction to Western Music\n)\n\nJazz (try\n21M.026 Jazz\n)\n\nWorld music (try\n21M.030 Introduction to World Music\n)\n\nThis is the class for you if you want to be creative with sound and performance. We will be experimenting with the fundaments of music making. Our inquiry will examine music from all time periods, as well as all cultures and regions. Nothing is assumed!\n\nPartial Listing of Topics\n\nListening\n\nSilence, Sound, Music, and Environment\n\nSound Walk\n\nPerforming\n\nNotation / Rhythm\n\nCollective Music Making\n\nThe Voice\n\nText-Sound\n\nOrganizing\n\nMusique Concrete\n\nAnalysis / Resynthesis\n\nForm\n\nRequirements and Policies\n\nThis is a\nHASS Arts Distribution\nundergraduate subject. Instead of term papers, you will be writing music to meet the writing requirement. All music that you write will be performed in-class by your fellow students, or will be presented on computer.\n\nIn addition to your composition assignments, you will also have frequent reading and listening assignments.\n\nThe final project will be a significant composition, to be assigned later in the semester. This composition will be performed during the last few weeks of the semester.\n\nLate assignments will not be accepted. Attendance is mandatory.\n\nYou will never need your cellphone during class, unless it is used in a composition as a sound source. Please keep your cellphones stored away. We will eventually be using your laptops for creating music, but not for the first month or so of the semester. Please keep your laptops stored away when we are not using them.\n\nRequired Forums & Concerts\n\nYou must attend these six events during semester, including four events with MIT artists-in-residence\nEither/Or\n. If you are unable to attend any of them due to a scheduling conflict, then we will find substitute events for you to go to. You must let me know by the beginning of the second week of class if you cannot attend any of these events.\n\nWEEKS\n\nEVENTS\n\nForum with Either/Or: the music of Alvin Lucier\n\nConcert by Either/Or: the music of Alvin Lucier\n\nForum with Charles Shadle\n\nForum with Either/Or: the music of Keeril Makan\n\nConcert by Either/Or: the music of Keeril Makan\n\nForum with Florian Hollerweger\n\nGrading\n\nACTIVITIES\n\nPERCENTAGES\n\nComposition assignments\n\nIn-class participation\n\nFinal project\n\nOne-page responses to listening / reading\n\nCalendar\n\nSession Key\n\nL = Lecture\n\nF = Forum\n\nC = Concert\n\nSES\n\nTOPICS\n\nKEY DATES\n\nL1\n\nIntroduction: silence, sound, music, and environment\n\nAssignment 1 (silent day) out\n\nL2\n\nSoundwalks\n\nAssignment 1 (silent day) due\n\nAssignment 2 (soundwalk) out\n\nL3\n\nEither/Or residency\n\nAssignment 2 (soundwalk) due\n\nF1\n\nForum with Either/Or\n\nL3\n\nAlvin Lucier\n\nC1\n\nEither/Or concert: Alvin Lucier\n\nL4\n\nNotation: Visualizing music\n\nEarle Brown\n\nAssignment 3 (visualizing music) out\n\nL5\n\nReview visualizing music assignment\n\nText-sound\n\nAssignment 3 (visualizing music) due\n\nAssignment 4 (text-sound composition) out\n\nL6\n\nWestern notation\n\nL7\n\nChoral music\n\nText-sound performances\n\nAssignment 4 (text-sound composition) due\n\nF2\n\nForum with Charles Shadle: discussing\nWestern Saddlebag\n, a newly composed suite of arrangements of traditional cowboy melodies for piano\n\nL8\n\nText-sound performances\n\nL9\n\nInstrument building\n\nAssignment 5 (instrumental building proposal) out\n\nL10\n\nInstrument building (cont.)\n\nAssignment 5 (instrumental building proposal) due\n\nAssignment 6 (SPEAR sounds) out; due 1 day later\n\nL11\n\nInstrument building (cont.)\n\nL12\n\nIn class performances with your instruments\n\nAssignment 7 (Audacity 1) out\n\nSpring Break week - no classes\n\nL13\n\nMusique Concrete\n\nAssignment 7 (Audacity 1) due\n\nL14\n\nEither/Or residency\n\nAssignment 8 (tabula rasa) out\n\nF3\n\nForum with Keeril Makan\n\nC2\n\nEither/Or concert: music of Keeril Makan\n\nL15\n\nTabula rasa assignment\n\nAssignment 8 (tabula rasa) due\n\nAssignment 9 (Audacity 2) out\n\nL16\n\nListen to and discuss tabula rasa compositions\n\nL17\n\nListen to and discuss tabula rasa compositions\n\nL18\n\nDiscuss Audacity 2 compositions; introduce final project\n\nAssignment 9 (Audacity 2) due\n\nL19\n\nListen to and discuss Audacity 2 compositions\n\nAssignment 10 (Audacity 2 response) out; due 5 days later\n\nL20\n\nNo lecture; individual meetings on project\n\nAssignment 11 (final project draft) due\n\nF4\n\nForum with Florian Hollerweger: \"The Revolution is Hear!
