The focus of the course is on standard usage, on reading in both traditional and simplified characters, and on writing. The course is conducted entirely in Chinese.\n\nCharacters and Pinyin\n\nStudents are expected to be able to read texts written in either the traditional or simplified sets of Chinese characters, and are free to choose either one in writing.\n\nRequired Learning Materials\n\nThere are two versions of this textbook:\n\nA simplified character version:\n\nLi, Duanduan. _A Primer for Advanced Beginners of Chinese, Simplified Character: Vol 2.

ISBN: 9780195911510.\n\n[Note: This dictionary has more entries than the previous dictionary, and is with English-to-Chinese.]\n\nMany online resources, available in\nTools / Resources\n.\n\nClass\n\nClassroom activities will include discussing the content of the texts, using the texts as the basis for short role playing and presentation, practicing some of the relevant grammatical patterns, and almost daily quizzes.\n\nWriting\n: You will be asked to learn a selection of the characters introduced in the lesson, but not all of them (see \"Dictations\" in \"Grading\"). And you will be asked to learn to recognize both simplified and full form characters from memory. For writing, you may choose one, full form or simplified, as you prefer.\n\nGrading\n\nA = 100-94; A- = 93-90; B+ = 89-87; B = 86-83; B- = 82-80\n\nC+ = 79-76; C = 75-70; C- = 69-60; F = below 60\n\nACTIVITIES\n\nPERCENTAGES\n\nClass Performance (Attendance 5%, Preparedness 5%, and Participation 10%)\n\n20%\n\nWritten Assignments\n\n20%\n\nLingt Assignments\n\n5%\n\nOnline Project (BFA)\n\n5%\n\n5 Tests\n\n25%\n\nGroup Presentations\n\n10%\n\nEnd-of-term Essay (a 2-page Double-spaced typewritten paper using Microsoft Word; 16-point font\nOr\nno less than 4 full pages, using the calligraphy sheet provided in\nStudy Materials\ninstructions on how to input Chinese characters using\npinyin\nis available in\nTools and Resources\n.)\n\n5%\n\nDictations and T / F Preview Questions\n\n10%\n\nAttendance and promptness is assumed; more than three unexcused absences (a week's worth) lowers your grade one letter; significant lateness will add up to absences--Twice during the semester, if you are late for class without telling your instructor in advance. If you miss a quiz in the beginning of the class, you are allowed to take the quiz at the end of the class.\n\nOther factors may come into play, for example improvement versus stagnation or deterioration over the course of the semester, and progress relative to starting level. Academic Integrity is extremely important in this class. Cheating on homework and tests, and plagiarizing will be reported.\n\nThere are\nNo Make-Ups\nfor quizzes and tests if you do not notify your instructor about your absence first but however, your lowest two quiz grades will be dropped. If you cannot take the quizzes on time, you should talk to the instructor to make arrangements for you to take the quizzes before your classmates do.\n\nThere is no final examination this term.\n\nHomework handed in late will not receive full credit. You will lose one point per day of lateness. (For example: 9 out 10 points if you turn it in next day)\n\nEnd-of-term Essay\n\nGrading (5% of class grade):\n\nContent: 2 points (convincing / engaging)\n\nDegree of sophistication of the language: 1.5 points (when appropriate, incorporate the grammar, sentence patterns, and vocabulary of the textbook into your essay)\n\nOver-all structure: 1.5 points (pay attention to coherence and cohesiveness; make sure each paragraph has a focus and the paragraphs relate to one another in a logical way)\n\nDue: By the last day of classes. E-attachments are accepted. E-submissions will be acknowledged by email. Early submissions are welcome.\n\nLength: No less than 2 full double-spaced typewritten pages using Word with 16-point font and 1-inch margins,\nOr\nno less than 4 full pages using the calligraphy sheet. Do not try to fill up the pages by adding spaces between characters or lines--the content is more important. Learn to install Chinese IME (Input Method Editor) and input Chinese characters (find the link under the section of\nTools and Resources\n) with pinyin if you do not already know how.\n\nTopic: You have three options.\n\nOption 1: Cong Zhongguoren Zhongshi de Pin'ge Kan ZhongGuo Wenhua\n\nBased on what you have learned from the textbook (you may also use examples in Vol. 1 of Daxue Yuwen), summarize some of the characteristics of Chinese culture by looking at the qualities (=pin'ge) Chinese people value highly.\n\nOption 2: Zhongguoren Dui Shijie de Gongxian\n\nUsing examples from the textbook (you may also use examples in Vol. 1 of Daxue Yuwen), write about the contributions Chinese have made to our world.\n\nOption 3: Creative writing\n\nAdvice on Approaching the Class\n\nEngaging in a language class should not feel like a chore that you resent having to do. If it does, you should probably do some serious thinking about why you are enrolled. A foreign language is a discipline to be studied with attention and dedication. It requires a high level of concentration, and a systematic, steady approach. It is, in fact, a never-ending process, which involves a consistent accumulation of data (vocabulary) to be applied within a complex framework (grammar). As such, learning a language is often frustrating and so it should be dealt with patiently. But the results provide lifelong satisfaction. If you approach this course by wondering how little work you can do and still get by, or if you approach this course by thinking only about what grade you are getting instead of what you are learning, then you will not succeed. If, however, you approach this class with dedication and a positive attitude you will be rewarded with the satisfaction that comes from the genuine acquisition of knowledge and skill.\n\nPresentation Rubric\n\nEXECELLENT (A)\n\nGOOD (B)\n\nAVERAGE (C)\n\nNEEDS IMPROVEMENT (D)\n\nPresentation Style (Overall)\n\nSmooth transitions; comprehensible with very few minor errors in grammar, vocabulary, pronunciation; consistently maintains good eye contact, appropriate speech rate and volume.\n\nTransitions mostly smooth; comprehensible with infrequent errors in grammar, vocabulary, pronunciation; almost always maintains good eye contact, appropriate speech rate and volume.\n\nTransitions fairly smooth; comprehensible with noticeable errors in grammar, vocabulary, pronunciation; eye contact, speech rate and volume adequate.\n\nTransitions awkward; nearly or completely incomprehensible; eye contact, speech rate and volume inconsistently maintained.\n\nGroup Participation\n\nAll team members worked together efficiently and effectively.\n\nMost team members worked together efficiently and effectively.\n\nStudents needed occasional teacher assistance to work together efficiently and effectively.\n\nOne or two students did all the work; little or no group interaction.",
