      "content": "| i\n| i\n| i\nh | 0i\n| i\nZ\n| i\nChapter 4\nBoson systems\nA boson system is the simplest system in nature. It demonstrates a wide variety of physical\nphenomena, such as superfluidity, magnetism, crystals, etc. We can also use boson system to study\nmany different phase transitions. Despite (or due to) its simplicity, a boson system may also be\nthe deep fundamental structure that produces all the elementary particles including photons and\nelectrons [Wen 2003b]. If this is true, a boson system will actually be a theory of everything.\nIn this chapter, we will study interacting bosons using a classical picture. We first develop a\nclassical field theory that describes the bosons. Then we consider the collective vibration modes\nof the field. After quantizing those vibration modes, we gain a understanding of the low energy\nproperties of the quantum interacting bosons.\n4.1\nA first look at a free boson system\nnboson Hamiltonian and nboson energy eigenstates for a free boson\n-\nsystem.\nThere are two kinds of particles in nature, bosons and fermions. Photons and Hydrogen\nmolecules are two examples of bosons. Photons hardly interact with each other. So the pho\nton system is a noninteracting boson system, or a free boson system. Hydrogen molecules have\na short range interaction. For a dilute Hydrogen gas there is little chance for two molecules to\nbe close to each other. Thus the interaction between the Hydrogen molecules can also be ignored\nand we can treat the Hydrogen gas as a system of free bosons. In this section, we will study such\nfree boson systems. To simplify our discussion even further, we will consider free bosons in one\ndimension. The generalization to higher dimension is often straight forward.\nTo construct a quantum theory for many bosons, let us start with the simplest case: the state\nwith no particle. Such a state is called a vacuum state and is denoted by 0 . The energy of such\na state is zero.\nThe next simplest state is a state with one particle. Actually there are many different one\nparticle states. Those states form a Hilbert space H1. One set of bases vectors for H1 is x which\ndescribe a particle at x. x 's are normalized according to\nx x\n= δ(x - x0).\nA generic oneparticle state ψ is described by a complex wave function ψ(x):\n|ψi =\ndx ψ(x) x\n\n| i\n|\ni\n|\ni\n|\ni\ni\n|\ni\n|\ni\n|\ni\n|\ni\n|\ni\nZ\n|\ni\ni\nLet us assume that the particle is relativistic and is described by the oneparticle Hamiltonian\nˆ\n2∂2 + m2c4\n(4.1.1)\nH1 =\np\n-c\nx\nwhere m is the mass of the particle and c the speed of light. The energy eigenstates of such a\nHamiltonian are plane waves\ni kx\n|ki =\nZ\ndxe\nx\nwith energy Ek =\n√\nc2k2 + m2c . Certainly the statistics is not important here. The oneparticle\nstates for a boson or a fermion are identical.\nFor a particle in three dimensions, ˆH1 becomes\nH1 =\nq\nc2(-∂2\nˆ\nx - ∂y 2 - ∂z 2) + m2c\nThe wave vector will have three components k = (kx, ky , kz ) and the energy of a 3D plain wave\nstate |ki will be Ek =\np\nc2k2 + m2c4. If we take m to be the mass of the Hydrogen molecule, Ek\nwill be the energy of of single Hydrogen molecule. For a single massless photon, the energy can be\nobtained by taking m = 0 and is given by Ek = c k .\n| |\nThe twoparticle states form a bigger Hilbert space H2. One set of bases vectors for H2 is x1x2\nwith a understanding that x1x2 and x2x1 are the two names for the same physical state. So we\nhave\n|x1x2 = x2x1\n(4.1.2)\nThe equivalence of x1x2 and x2x1 is very important. It means that there is only one state with\none particle at x1 and one particle at x2. If x1x2 and x2x1 describe two different quantum states,\nthen there are two different states with one particle at x1 and one particle at x2. In this case the\nsystem will be a system of nonidentical particles. The condition that there is only a single state\nwith one particle at x1 and one particle at x2 makes the particles in our system identical particles.\nA generic twoparticle state is given by\nψtwoparticlesi =\ndx1 dx2 ψ(x1, x2) x1x2\n(4.1.3)\n|\nx16x2\n|\ni\nNote that the integration is only over the region x1 6 x2 to avoid double counting, since x1x2 and\n|x2x1 represent the same state. So the the twoparticle wave function ψ(x1, x2) is only defined for\nx1 6 x2.\nUsing eqn (4.1.2), we can extend the wave function ψ(x1, x2) to the region with x1 > x2 through\nthe relation\nψ(x1, x2) = ψ(x2, x1)\nThis allows us to rewrite eqn (4.1.3) as\n1 Z\nψtwoparticlesi =\ndx1 dx2 ψx1,x2 x1x2\n|\n|\ni\nwhere the integration is over the whole 2D plane (x1, x2). We see that the states of two identical\nparticles can be described by symmetric wave functions ψ(x1, x2) = ψ(x2, x1).\nA careful reader may note that so far we only specified that the two particles are identical parti\ncles. We did not specify if the two particles are bosons or fermions. So the above reasoning implies\nthat both bosonic and fermionic identical particles are described by symmetric wave functions.\n\n|\ni\n|\ni\n|\ni\nBut what determines the statistics of the identical particles? It turns out that the statistics\nis not determined by the symmetry or antisymmetry property of the wave function, but by the\nHamiltonian that governs the dynamics of the two particles.\nIf we choose the Hamiltonian that acts on the twoparticle state ψtwoparticlesi to be the sum of\n|\ntwo oneparticle Hamiltonian (4.1.1)\nˆ\nq\n-c2∂2\nq\n-c2∂2\n2 4\nH2 =\nx1 + m2c4 +\n+ m c\n(4.1.4)\nx2\nthen the two identical particles will be bosons. Further more such a Hamiltonian also implies that\nthere is no interaction between the two particles. So ˆH2 describes our free 1D boson system with\ntwo bosons.\nˆ\nWe note that H2 is invariant under the exchange x1\nx2. So when it acts on a symmetric\nˆ\n↔\nwave function ψ(x1, x2), H2 will generate another symmetric wave function. Since the identical\nparticles (bosons or fermions) are always described by symmetric wave functions, the twoparticle\nHamiltonian for identical particles are always invariant under the exchange, so that the action of\nthe Hamiltonian on the allowed wave functions can only generate allowed wave functions.\nThe energy eigenstates of ˆH2 are plain waves ψ(x1, x2) = e i (k1x1+k2x2) + e i (k1x2+k2x1 ) (which is\nsymmetric under the exchange of x1 and x2) or\nZ\ndx1 dx2\ne i (k1x1+k2x2) + e i (k1x2+k2x1 )\nx1x2\nk1k2 =\n|\ni\nx16x2\n|\ni\nWe note that k1k2\n= k2k1 . So k1k2 's are also redundant names: |k1k2\nand k2k1\nare two\n|\ni\n|\ni\n|\ni\ni\n|\ni\nnames for the same plain wave state. The energy of the plain wave state is Ek1k2 = 2k1 + 2k2 where\n2k =\np\nc2k2 + m2c4 .\n(4.1.5)\nThe above discussion can be easily generalized to nparticles.

The statistics of the identical particles is determined by nparticle\nHamiltonians. This provides a unified way to understand Bose, Fermi,\nand fractional statistics.\nWe have stressed that both bosons and fermions can be described by symmetric wave functions.\nThe statistics of the identical particles are determined by the manyparticle Hamiltonian. The\nparticular twoparticle Hamiltonian (4.1.4) gives rise to Bose statistics. A curious reader may\nwonder what kind of twoparticle Hamiltonian gives rise to Fermi statistics. As an example, let me\njust write a twoparticle Hamiltonian that gives rise to Fermi statistics in 2D (in nonrelativistic\n\nx\n(x,y)\nΘ\ny\nFigure 4.1: The definition of the function Θ(x, y).\nlimit):\nHferm\n(∂\n+ i ax)2 + (∂y1 + i ay )2\n(∂\n- i ax)2 + (∂y2 - i ay )2\nx1\nx2\nˆ\n=\n-\n2m\n-\n2m\nax =\ny1 - y2\nay =\nx1 - x2\n(x1 - x2)2 + (y1 - y2)2 ,\n- (x1 - x2)2 + (y1 - y2)2 ,\n(4.2.1)\nWe note that ˆ2\nHferm is still invariant under the exchange x1\nx2. Such a twoparticle Hamiltonian\n↔\nwhen acting on symmetric wave functions ψ(x1, y1, x2, y2) = ψ(x2, y2, x1, y1) describes two fermions\nin two dimensions.\nˆHferm can be simplified by the following transformation\nψ(x1, y1, x2, y2) = e i Θ(x1-x2 ,y1 -y2) ψ(x1, y1, x2, y2)\nHferm\ne i Θ(x1-x2 ,y1 -y2)\nˆ\n=\nHferm e- i Θ(x1-x2 ,y1 -y2)\nˆ\n(4.2.2)\nwhere Θ(x, y) is the angle between the vector (x, y) and the positive x direction (see Fig. 4.1).\nFor positive x and y, Θ(x, y) = arctan\n¡ y ¢\n. Although Θ(x, y) is discontinuous on the positive\nx\nxaxis with a discontinuity of 2π, the function e i Θ(x,y) is a smooth function of (x, y) (except at\n(x, y) = (0, 0)). Using the relation\ne i Θ(x,y)∂x e- i Θ(x,y)\nx2 + y2 ,\ne i Θ(x,y)∂y e- i Θ(x,y) = - i\nx\n= i\ny\nx2 + y2 ,\nˆ\nwe find that the transformed Hamiltonian\nHferm has a simple form\n\nHferm\nˆ\n= - 2m (∂2 + ∂y\n1 ) - 2\nm (∂2 + ∂2 ).\nx1\nx2\ny2\nFrom e i Θ(x,y) = - e i Θ(-x,-y), we can show that the transformed wave function is antisymmetric\n\nψ (x1, y1, x2, y2) = -ψ(x2, y2, x1, y1).\n\nSo the simple twoparticle Hamiltonian ˆHferm when acting on antisymmetric wave functions\nψ (x1, y1, x2, y2) describes two fermions in two dimensions. This way we recover the usual result\nthat fermions are described by antisymmetric wave functions.\nIn the standard way to understand fermions, fermions are defined as particles described by\nantisymmetry wave functions. Through the above discussion, we see that this standard under\nstanding of fermions did not capture the essence of Fermi statistics. This is because fermions can\nbe described by both symmetric wave functions (with a complicated manyparticle Hamiltonian)\nor antisymmetric wave functions (with a simpler manyparticle Hamiltonian).\nI personally believe that symmetric wave functions plus complicated manyparticle Hamiltonian\nis a correct way to understand fermions, at least physically. The standard understanding using\n\nantisymmetric wave function is very formal and misleading despite its mathematical simplicity.\nThe confusion cause by the standard understanding is reflected in the following conversation:\nA: I have two fermions. One at x1 and the other at x2. I wonder what is the amplitude of such a\nstate.\nB: Well it depends on how you say it. If you say one fermion at x1 and one fermion at x2, the\namplitude will be ψ. If you say one fermion at x2 and one fermion at x1, the amplitude will be\n-ψ.\nA: This is ridiculous. The two ways of saying mean exactly the same thing. How come it leads to\ntwo different results.\nB: Well, it is not that ridiculous. You know that two wave functions differ by a total phase factor\ne i θ actually describe the same quantum state. So the amplitudes ψ and -ψ actually correspond to\nthe same physical state. There is no contradiction.\nA: But then why is the minus sign important? Why does the minus sign characterize the Fermi\nstatistics? Saying one particle at x2 and the other at x1 may very well leads to an amplitude e i θ ψ\ninstead of -ψ. The phase θ should have no physical meaning, less to determine the statistics of\nthe identical particles.\nB: Well, we should look at the wave function of identical particles ψ(x1, x2, ..., xn) as a whole.\nImposing an arbitrary exchange phase, say ψ(x1, x2, ..., xn) = e i θ ψ(x2, x1, ..., xn), may result in a\ndiscontinuous manyparticle wave function ψ(x1, x2, ..., xn). Only when θ = 0 or π can we have a\ncontinuous wave function.\nA: But the continuity of the wave function should not be essential. If the identical particles are\ndefined on a lattice, the continuity of the wave function will be meaningless. On the other hand,\nidentical particles on lattice still have well defined statistics (and even fractional statistics in 2D).\nI hope that I have made my point. The statistics of identical particles is a very tricky subject.\nUsing exchange symmetry of manyparticle wave function to understand statistics is formal and\nmisleading. It misses the essence of statistics. If we understand the statistics that way, the origin\nof statistics will appear to be very mysterious. Such a understanding does not tell us how to make\nidentical particles with different statistics. It does not encourage us to think how to make identical\nparticles with different statistics. It suggests that the statistics is fundamental and is given. We\njust have to accept it.\nIn contrast, the description of identical particle using symmetric wave function and encoding\nthe statistics in the manyparticle Hamiltonian leads to completely different picture. I believe it is\na more correct picture that captures more essence of statistics despite its mathematical complexity.\nWithin such a picture, statistics of identical particles is a dynamical property determined by many\nparticle Hamiltonian. We can change the Hamiltonian to obtain different statistics. We can also\nnaturally obtain fractional statistics in two dimensions. Such an understanding tells us how to\nmake different statistics. We can also have phase transitions that change the statistics of particles.\nWe will have a more detailed discussion of Fermi statistics later.\nProblem 4.2.1\nBy rescaling ax and ay in eqn (4.2.1), we can obtain the Hamiltonian that describes two particles with fractional\nstatistics. The following Hamiltonian, when acting on symmetric wave functions, describes two such particles\nconfined by a harmonic potential K\n2 (x2 + y2):\nHfrac\nˆ\n= - 2\nm (∂x1 + iax)2 - 2m (∂y1 + iay )2\n(∂x2 - iax)2\n(∂y2 - iay )2\n- 2m\n- 2m\nK\n+ 2 (x + y 2 + x + y2 )\nax = θ\nπ\ny1 - y2\n(x1 - x2)2 + (y1 - y2)2 ,\nay = - θ\nπ\nx1 - x2\n(x1 - x2)2 + (y1 - y2)2 ,\n(4.2.3)\nwhere θ is the statistical angle. θ = 0 correspond to bosons and θ = π correspond to fermions.\n(a) Find the ground state energy of ˆHfrac for θ = 0, π/2, and π.\n\ny\ny\nx\nx\nFigure 4.2: Exchanging two particles.\n(b) The ground state energy for two bosons/fermions in the harmonic potential K\n2 (x2 + y2) can also be obtained\nby filling energy levels. Check the correctness of your results in (a) against the results obtained by filling energy\nlevels.\n(c) Can we still use a transformation similar to eqn (4.2.2) to encode the fractional statistics in the exchange\nsymmetry of the wave function?\nProblem 4.2.2\n(a) Find a 3particle Hamiltonian that acts on symmetric wave functions and describes Fermi statistics.

(Try to choose the 3particle Hamiltonian in (a) such that the transformed\n3particle Hamiltonian is a sum of three oneparticle Hamiltonians.)\n4.3\nA second look at the free boson system\n- The bosons states with different numbers of bosons can all be labeled by\noccupation numbers.\n- A free boson system is equivalent to collection of harmonic oscillators.\nIn the section 4.1, we have viewed vacuum as an empty stage. The bosons are actors on the\nstage. In this picture, the existence and the origin of identical particles are very mysterious. To\nappreciate this point, let us consider a state with particle 1 at x and particles 2 at y. After\nexchanging the two particles we get another state with particle 1 at y and particles 2 at x (see\nFig. 4.2). If the two states are different, then the two particles are not identical. If the two states\nbefore and after the exchange are actually the same state, then the two particles are called identical\nparticles\nBut why the two states have to be the same? It appears that we can always follow the trajec\ntories of the particles in time history to distinguish the two states before and after the exchange.\nThis is the source of the mystery of identical particles, if we view particles are somethings placed in\nan empty vacuum. We wonder where do identical particles come from? Why do they have to exist?\nThe mystery of identical particles is one of most fundamental mystery of our nature. It reflects\ncertain deep structures in physics law and the properties of our vacuum. But what is the message?\nWhat does the existence of identical particle tell us about the physics laws and the properties of\nvacuum? In this section, we will try to provide an answer to those fundamental questions. We will\nuse the 1D free boson system to illustrate our points.\nWe assume the bosons live on circle of length L. In this case, the wave vectors k are quantized:\n2π\nk = κn ≡\nn\nL\nwhere n is an integer. The total Hilbert space of arbitrary number of bosons is formed by the\nnoboson state, oneboson states, twoboson states, etc:\n=\n, k1 , k1k2\nH = H0 ⊕H1 ⊕H2 · · ·\n{|0i |\ni |\ni, · · · }\n\n|\ni\nκ\nκ\nκ\nκ\nκ\nκ κ κ κ\nk\nε\nk\n-4\n-3\n-2\n-1\nFigure 4.3: The circles on the dispersion curve 2k correspond to allowed klevels labeled by κn. The\nempty dots represent unoccupied klevels with nκn = 0, and the filled dots occupied klevels with\nnκn = 1. Two filled dots together represent doubly occupied levels with nκn = 2. The state in the\nabove graph is described by\nnκ-1 nκ0 nκ1\n= 1, nκ2 = 2 and other nκn = 0 in\nnκ2 · · ·i with nκ-3\n| · · ·\nthe occupationnumber notation. It is a threeboson state described by k1k2k3 with k1 = -6π/L\nand k2 = k3 = 4π/L in the wavevector notation.\nInstead of using ki that describes the momentum of each boson, we can use a set of the occu\npation numbers nκn to label each bosonic state in H\nnκ0 nκ1 nκ2 · · ·i. nκn is the number of\nnκ-1\n| · · ·\nbosons in the level with momentum k = κn (see Fig. 4.3). Such an level will be called klevel. The\nvacuum state 0 is given by the state with all nκn = 0: 0 =\n0000 · · ·i. The oneboson state k1\n| i\n| i\n| · · ·\n|\ni\nis given by the state with all nκn = 0, except nk1 = 1. A more general state is represented in Fig.\n4.3. In this way, all the states in H are labeled by\nnκ-1 nκ0 nκ1 nκ2 · · ·i with nκn =\n.\n| · · ·\n0, 1, 2, · · ·\nFrom the relation between the two ways of labeling states, |k1k2 · · ·i and | · · · nκ-1 nκ0 nκ1\none can show that P\ni 2ki = P\nn nκn 2κn . So if the bosons are free, the state | · · · nκ-1 nκ0 nκ1\nnκ2 · · ·i,\nnκ2 · · ·i\nis an energy eigenstate with an energy\nEtot =\nX\nnκn 2κn .\n(4.3.1)\nn\nWe like to show that the above free boson system can be viewed as a collection of harmonic\noscillators. The different oscillators in the collection are labeled by κn. The eigenstates of the\n|\ni\n2 )~ωκn where ωκn is the oscillation\noscillator κn are labeled by nκn . The energy of nκn is (nκn + 1\nangular frequency of the oscillator κn. If we put the oscillators together, a state of the collection\nwith the oscillator κn in the nκn th excited state can be denoted as\nnκ-1 nκ0 nκ1 nκ2 · · ·i. The\nenergy of such a state is P\nn(nκn + 1\n| · · ·\n2 )~ωκn . We see that if we choose ~ωκn = 2κn , then the above\nenergy will reproduce the boson energy P\nn nκn 2κn apart from an overall constant 1 P\nn 2κn . Also\nthe oscillator states and the manyboson states have an onetoone correspondence. Thus the free\nmanyboson system can be viewed as a collection of harmonic oscillators.\n4.4\nA vibratingstring picture of 1D boson system\n- A 1D boson system is equivalent to quantized vibrating string.\n- A classical vibrating string provides a classical picture of 1D bosons.\nThe vibrating string has a more formal name - 1D field theory.\nThe collection of the oscillators with frequency ωκn = 2κn =\np\nc2κ2 + m2c4 can be shown to\nn\nbe the vibration modes of a string. This leads to a vibratingstring picture or a field theory of the\nbosons. Let us consider a string whose dynamics is described by the following wave equation\nh(x, t) = c 2∂2h(x, t) -m c 4h(x, t)\n(4.4.1)\nx\n\nwhere h(x, t) is the vibration amplitude of the string and we assume the string form a loop of length\nL:\nh(x, t) = h(x + L, t).\nTo show that the vibration modes of the above wave equation reproduce the collection of the\noscillators labeled by κn, we rewrite the wave equation as\nh(x, t) =\np\n-c2∂2 + m2c4 p(x, t)\nx\n-p (x, t) =\np\n-c2∂2 + m2c4 h(x, t)\n(4.4.2)\nx\nIntroducing a complex amplitude\nh(x, t) + i p(x, t)\nφ(x, t) =\n√\n(4.4.3)\nthe wave equation (4.4.2) becomes\ni φ (x, t) =\np\n-c2∂2 + m2c4 φ(x, t)\n(4.4.4)\nx\nwhich has a form of Schr odinger equation! Now we do mode expansion by writing\ni κnx\nφ(x, t) =\nX\nφκn (t)L-1/2 e\nκn\nThe wave equation (4.4.4) becomes\ni φ κn (t) =\np\nc2κ2 + m2c4 φκn (t)\n(4.4.5)\nn\nLet Xκn and Pκn be the real and imaginary parts of φκn = Xκn + i Pκn . We rewrite eqn (4.4.5) as\nXκn (t) =\np\nc2κ2 + m2c4 Pκn (t)\nn\nPκn (t) = -\np\nc2κ2 + m2c4 Xκn (t)\n(4.4.6)\nn\nWe recognize that that eqn (4.4.6) is the equation of motion of an oscillator with Xκn as the\ncoordinate and Pκn as the momentum. There is one oscillator for every κn = 2πn/L. The mass of\n2κ2\nthe oscillator is Mκn = 1/\np\nc\n+ m2c4 and the spring constant is Kκn =\np\nc2κ2 + m2c . So the\nn\nn\ntotal (classical) energy of the oscillators is\n¶\nEtot =\nX μ\n2Mκn\nPκ\nn + 2 Kκn X2\nκn\nκn\n=\nZ\ndx φ∗(x)\np\n-c2∂2 + m2c4 φ(x)\nx\n=\nZ\ndx\nA\n1 h\nh + 1 h\np\n-c\n+ m2c4 h\n!\n(4.4.7)\n2∂2\n+ m2c\nx\n2 p\n-c\nx\n2∂2\nThe expression of the energy and the equation of motion (4.4.1) or (4.4.4) provide a complete\ndescription of the oscillators as a classical system. Such a system of vibrating string is also called\na classical field theory (in one dimension) where h or φ is the field. From the order of the time\nderivative, we find that eqn (4.4.1) is a coordinatespace equation of motion while eqn (4.4.4) is a\nphasespace equation of motion.\nFor oscillator κn, the oscillation frequency is ωκn =\np\nKκn /Mκn =\np\nc2κ2 + m2c4. We see that\nn\n~ωκn = 2κn (note that ~ = 1). So indeed the vibration modes of the string give rise to the collection\n\n(a)\n(b)\nε k\nk\nk\nk\n(b)\n(a)\n(c)\nFigure 4.4: Three pictures of a twoboson state where both bosons have the same momentum\nk = 2 2π . (a) The momentum picture, (b) the occupation picture, and (c) the vibratingstring\nL\npicture.\nFigure 4.5: (a) A boson gas and (b) the same boson gas as a vibrating string.\nof the oscillators that describes the bosons with dispersion relation 2k =\n√\nc2k2 + m2c4 (see Fig.\n4.4).\nThe above result is quite amazing. The quantum theory of a vibrating string described by\neqn (4.4.1) is the same as the quantum theory of bosons described by eqn (4.1.6)! So instead of\nusing the picture Fig. 4.5a to describe a quantum boson gas, we can also use the picture Fig. 4.5b\nto describe the same quantum boson gas. The picture Fig. 4.5b represents a field theory description\nof the boson gas.\nThe vibratingstring picture of the boson gas only works in 1D. In 2D, we need to replace\nstring by membrane: a boson gas in 2D can also be regarded a vibrating membrane. Similarly in\nddimensions, a boson gas is equivalent to a vibrating dbrane (a ddimensional membrane).\nProblem 4.4.1\nFollowing the example of Fig. 4.4, draw three pictures for a twoboson state with one boson carrying momentum\nk = 4π/L and the other k = 6π/L.\n4.5\n*The second quantized description of free bosons\n- Quantization of the vibrating string.\n- A Hamiltonian without fixing the number of bosons.\n- Boson creation and annihilation operators.\nThe vibrating string discussed in the last section is a classical theory. Such a classical theory\ndoes not directly describe the quantum boson gas. Only quantized vibrating string describe the\nquantum bosons. To quantize the vibrating string, we note that a vibrating string is a collection\nof oscillators described by (Xκn , Pκn ). Since (Xκn , Pκn ) is a canonical coordinatemomentum pair,\na quantized theory can be obtained by replacing (Xκn , Pκn ) by a pair of operators ( ˆXκn , Pˆκn ) that\nsatisfy\nˆ\n[Xκn , Pˆκn ] = i\n\nSo after quantization, the classical modes φκn and the classical field φ(x) all become operators:\nφκn\nφˆκn = √1\n2( ˆXκn + i Pˆκn )\n→\nˆ\ni xκn ˆ\nφ(x) → φ(x) =\nX\nL-1/2 e\nψκn\nκn\nOne can check that φˆκn and φˆ(x) satisfy the following algebra\n[φˆκn , φˆ+ ] = δκnκm ,\n[φˆκn , φˆκm ] = 0.\n(4.5.1)\nκm\nand\nˆ\n[φˆ(x), φ+(x0)] = δ(x -x0),\n[φˆ(x), φˆ(x0)] = 0,\nThe Hamiltonian of the quantized vibrating string can be obtained from the classical energy\nEtot = P\nκn\n1 2κn (P 2 + X2 ) (see eqn (4.4.7))\nκn\nκn\nˆ\n1 2κn (Pˆ2\nX2\nH0 =\nX\nκn + ˆκn )\nκn\nφ+ ˆ\n=\nX\n2κn (ˆκn φκn + 2)\n(4.5.2)\nκn\nwhere 2k is given by eqn (4.1.5). Let nκn be the eigenvalues of φˆκ\n+\nn φˆκn . The eigenstates of ˆH0 has\na form\nnκ-1 nκ0 nκ1 nκ2 · · ·i which has an eigenvalue P\nκn nκn 2κn . So the above Hamiltonian can\n| · · ·\nalso be regarded as the Hamiltonian of the free quantum manyboson system. Such a description\nof the bosons is called the second quantized description.\nFrom eqn (4.5.1) and eqn (4.5.2), we see that φˆκ\n+\nn and φˆκn are the raising and the lowing\noperators of the oscillator κn. Since the eigenvalues of φˆ+\nκn φˆκn correspond to occupation numbers,\nthe total boson number operator is given by\nˆN =\nX\nφˆ+ ˆ\n=\nZ\ndx φˆ+(x)φˆ(x)\nκn φκn\nκn\nThus we may interpret φˆ+(x)φˆ(x) as the boson numberdensity operator. One can also show that\nˆ\nˆ\nˆ\n[N, φˆ+] = φˆ+,\n[N, φˆ] = -φ.\nwhere φˆ is φˆ(x) or φˆκn . Thus φˆ+ increases the boson number by one while φˆ decreases the boson\nnumber by one. For this reason we also call φ+ the creation operator and φ the annihilation operator\nIn contract to the Hamiltonian (4.1.6) in the particle picture which only acts on nparticle states,\nthe Hamiltonian (4.5.2) in the second quantized description acts on states with any numbers of\nbosons.\n4.6\nVacuum as a dynamical medium and the Casimir effect\n- The differences between the two views of bosons: the particle picture and\nthe vibratingstring picture.\n- Vacuum is not empty. It is a dynamical medium just like any materials\nencountered in condensed matter physics.\n\nWe have discussed two ways to view a manyboson system: the particle picture (which include\nboth the momentum picture k1 k2 · · ·i and the occupation picture\nnκ0 nκ1 nκ2 · · ·i) and the\nnκ-1\n|\n| · · ·\nvibratingbrane picture. The essence of the particle picture is the assumption that the vacuum is\nempty. In this picture, bosons are thing placed on the empty vacuum. However, in the vibrating\nbrane picture, the vacuum is regarded as a dynamical nonempty medium. The vibration of such a\nmedium gives rise to bosons in the vacuum. In the last section, we have stressed the mathematical\nequivalence of the two pictures. However, the two pictures are not equivalent in physical sense.\nFirst, the vibratingbrane picture (or the field theory picture) provides an origin and an expla\nnation of identical particles. The particles arising from the vibrations of a dbrane are naturally\nand always identical bosons. Actually, it is impossible to obtain nonidentical particles from the\nvibrations of the brane. In contrast, particles do not have to be identical particles in the particle\npicture. In this case, the existence and the appearance of identical particles is very mysterious.\nWe can also turn our argument around. The very existence of identical particles in our vacuum\nsuggests that we should not view particles as things placed in an empty vacuum. We should instead\nview our vacuum as a 3brane and the particles as the vibrations of the 3brane. Our vacuum is\nnot empty. It is a dynamical medium whose collective motion give rise to elementary particles. So\nour vacuum just like a material studied on condensed matter physics. The theory of elementary\nparticles is actually a theory about one material - the vacuum material.\nHere we would like to remark that the vibratingbrane only reproduce a particular kind of identical particles -\nscaler bosons. The photons in our vacuum are actually vector bosons (or gauge bosons) due to its two polarizations\nand electrons are fermions. Those particles cannot arise from vibrating 3branes. However, as we will see later in\nthis book, the above philosophy is still correct. We should not view our vacuum as an empty stage. We should\nview it as a dynamical medium whose collective motion can even give rise to photons and electrons. The vacuum\nmaterial has a more complicated internal structure than the simple 3brane. It is this more complicated internal\nstructure that leads to photons, electrons, gluons, quarks,[Wen 2002, 2003b] and possibly all other elementary\nparticles observed in our vacuum. In this chapter, for simplicity, we treat photons as massless scaler bosons and\nregard them as vibrations of a 3brane.\nThe above discussion about the advantage of the vibratingbrane picture sounds philosophical.\nActually, the vibratingbrane picture has a measurable consequence - Casimir effect.[Casimir 1948]\nThe Casimir effect has been observed in our vacuum, confirming that the vibratingbrane picture\nis a correct picture while the particle picture is an incorrect picture for bosons.\nTo understand the Casimir effect, we start with the energy of vacuum. In the particle picture,\nthe vacuum is just a empty stage or a reference point. We naturally assign a zero energy to it and\ndefine the reference point of energy. In contrast, the vacuum energy in the vibratingbrane picture\nis naturally nonzero and is given by the zeroenergies 1 ~ωk = 2 2k of the oscillators. For 1D free\nboson system, the vacuum energy is given by\nUvac =\nX\n2κn\nκn\nwhere 2k is the dispersion of the bosons. One may say that Uvac is just a constant term in the total\nenergy which define the reference point of the energy. Such a constant term has no measurable\neffect. Indeed, Uvac cannot be measured directly. However, if we change the dispersion 2k and/or\nchange the distribution of quantized momentum κn, then the change in Uvac has physical effects\nand can be measured.\nBefore discussing how to calculate the change of Uvac , let us calculate Uvac itself. At first sight,\nthe calculation of Uvac appear to be very simple since Uvac = 2\nP\nκn 2κn = +inf. Certainly, such a\nsimple result of infinity is meaningless. The infinite Uvac is the famous infinity problem that plague\nall forms of field theories. It is so annoying that it once led people to abandon field theories. One\ncan use this infinity problem to argue that the vibratingbrane picture for bosons is wrong.\n\nlP\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure 4.6: According to quantum gravity, a continuous string cannot be a physical reality. A real\nstring may look more like a sequence discrete beads.\nFigure 4.7: (a) A boson gas between two hard walls. (b) The same boson gas is described by a\nvibrating string with boundary condition h(0) = h(L) = 0.\nActually, the problem of the infinity is not the problem of the vibratingbrane picture but the\nproblem of regarding space (or the vibratingbrane) as a continuous manifold. As has been argued\nin section 2.2, continuous manifold simply does not exist in our universe. It is meaningless and\nimpossible to have two points separated by a distance less the Planck length lP . Similarly, a wave\nvector larger than 1/lP is also meaningless. So it is more correct to view the string as a sequence\ndiscrete beads (see Fig. 4.6). I would like to stress that this is a quantum gravity effect (see section\n2.2). Our vibratingbrane picture is meaningful only for wave vectors less then Λ ∼ 1/lP if we take\ninto account the quantum gravity effect. The momentum scale Λ is called the cutoff scale. So\nwe should limit the Wave vector summation P\nκn to over the meaningful wave vectors |κn < Λ.\n|\nTherefore, the vacuum energy is really finite\nUvac =\nX\n2κn\nκn=0,±2π/L,±4π/L,··· ,±Λ\nCertainly, we are not sure that the energy levels should suddenly disappear for k above Λ as implied\nby the above formula. We may very well have a softer cutoff\n/Λ\nUvac =\nX\n2κn e-|κn|\nκn =0,±2π/L,±4π/L,···\nBut what is the right way to calculate Uvac? The physics at short distance is still unknown\nto us (since we still do not have a theory of quantum gravity). So it is not clear what is the\ncorrect way to cutoff the wave vector summation P\nκn . However, we will see later that the low\nenergy and long distance effects do not depend on how we cutoff the momentum summation. This\nallows us to make prediction without a complete understanding of the theory. The ignorance of the\nshort distance physics does not prevent us from gaining a (partial) understanding of long distance\nphysics.\nLet us consider a 1D mass m boson system between two hard walls (see Fig. 4.7a). One wall\nis at x = 0 and the other at x = L. Such a boson system is described by a string (4.4.1) that\nsatisfy the boundary condition h(0) = h(L) = 0 (see Fig. 4.7b).1 In contrast to the periodic\nboundary condition h(0) = h(L), the string vibration modes for the hardwall case has a form\nh(x) ∝ sin(nπx/L) and are labeled by κn = nπ/L, n = 0, 1, 2, · · · . In this case, the vacuum energy\nThe connection between the hard wall and the boundary condition h(0) = h(L) = 0 will be discussed in section\n4.7.\n\na\nL\nFigure 4.8: The vibrating string with h(0) = h(a) = h(L) = 0 describes a boson gas between three\nhard walls.\nis different from that for periodic boundary condition\nU hw\nκn e-| |\nvac(L) =\nX\nκn /Λ\nκn=0,π/L,2π/L,···\n| | U hw\nFor massless particles, 2k = c k .\nvac(L) can be calculated easily.

The third hard wall modifies the\ndistribution of the vibration modes which changes the vacuum energy. Using the result (4.6.1), we\nfind the modified vacuum energy to be\nΛ2L\ncπ\ncπ\nU hw\nvac(a, L) = 4cπ - 24(L - a) - 24a + O(Λ-2)\nWhen L is very large (i.e. L A a), we find that the total vacuum energy depends on the separation\ncπ\nbetween the two walls at x = 0 and a: U hw\nvac (a, L) = -\n+Const. This causes an attractive force\n24a\nbetween the two walls separated by a distance a\nπ~c\nF =\n24a\nThis force between two walls in vacuum is called the Casimir effect.[Casimir 1948] It is interesting to\nnote that the force does not depend on the cutoff.\nThe above result is for massless bosons in 1D. For massless photons in 3D, the attractive force\nbetween two plates separated by a is\nπ2~c\nF =\nA\n240a\nwhere A is the area of the plates. Such a force was measured by Spamaay, 1958 and Lamoreaux,\n1997, indicating that our vacuum is really a dynamical medium. The study of our vacuum and its\nelementary particles is really a material science.\n4.7\nClassical field theory for nonrelativistic free bosons\n- Phasespace Lagrangian for the classical field theory that describes free\nbosons.\nIn the section 4.4, we discussed the classical field theory (or the vibratingstring picture) of\nrelativistic bosons. The same calculation also apply to a ddimensional nonrelativistic bosons in a\npotential U . Such nonrelativistic bosons have a dispersion\nk2\n2k =\n+ U\n2m\n\nμ\n¶\nZ\nμ\n¶\nZ\nZ\nμ\nμ\n¶ ¶\nand are described by an nparticle Hamiltonian\nn\nˆ\n=\nX\n(-\nHn\n∂xi + U)\n(4.7.1)\n2m\ni=1\nFollowing the discussion in the last section, we can show that the quantum system (4.7.1) is related\nto a classical system - a classical field theory or a vibrating brane.

A hard wall in a certain region can be realized\nby an inifinite potential U(x) in that region. In order for the total energy (4.7.3) to be finite, an\ninifinite potential in a region will force φ(x) to be zero in that region. This is why a hard wall can\nbe represented by the boundary condition φ(x) = 0 or h(x) = 0.\nProblem 4.7.1\nDerive eqn (4.7.2) and eqn (4.7.3) from the phasespace Lagrangian (4.7.4).\n4.8\n*The second quantized description of interacting bosons\n- The manybody Hamiltonian that describes interacting bosons.\n- The boson density operator.\nNow let us turn to a more complicated problem of interacting bosons.

What is the second\nquantized description (or the oscillator description) of the interacting bosons?\nAgain the second quantized description is written in terms of the boson creation/annihilation\noperators φˆ and φˆ+. To obtain the form of the second quantized Hamiltonian for interacting bosons,\nwe first note that the total potential energy can be rewritten in terms of the boson density\nX\nV (xi - xj ) =\nZ\ndd xdd x0\n2 n(x)V (x - x0)n(x0)\ni<j\nSince the boson density operator is given by ˆn(x) = φˆ+(x)φˆ(x) as discussed in section 4.5, the\ninteraction Hamiltonian is given by\nˆ\n2 ˆ\nn(x0)\nHint =\nZ\ndd xdd x 1 n(x)V (x - x0)ˆ\nˆ\nˆ\n= 2V\nX\nφˆ\nk\n+\n+q φˆkVq φ+\nk0-q φk0\nq,k,k\nwhere\nZ\ndd x e- i q·xV (x)\nVq =\nHere we have assumed that our system is a ddimensional cube of volume V = Ld.

Naively, one expects 2k describes the boson dispersion and should\n2k = 2m + U . As we will see below, this naive expectation is incorrect. We need to\nbe taken to be\nk2\nchoose a different 2k in order to reduce the singleboson dispersion k2 + U .\n2m\nTo determine the proper form of\nH in eqn (4.8.3).\n2k, let us discuss a few known eigenstates of ˆ\nOne eigenstate |0i of ˆH is defined by the algebraic relation\nφˆk|0i = 0\n(4.8.4)\nˆ\nSuch a state is an eigenstate of the boson number operator with zero eigenvalue N 0 = 0.

Another class of the\neigenstates is given by\n|ki = φˆ+ 0\nk\nTo show |ki is an eigenstate, we commute φˆ through φˆ+ in ˆH using the commutation relation (4.8.2)\nto put all a to the right of a+. Such a procedure is called normal ordering.

Using eqn (4.8.5), we easily see that k is an eigenstate of H with\neigenvalue Ek = 2k + E0. k is a state with one boson that carries a momentum k. The excitation\nenergy of such a oneboson state is Ek - E0 = 2k. We see that the singleboson dispersion is given\nV (0)\n2k to be\n|\nby 2k. To reproduce the dispersion 2k = k|2 + U, we need to choose\n2k = |\nk\nm\n2 + U -\n.\n|\n2m\nA generic state described by a collection of boson occupation numbers {nk} can be created by\nthe boson creation operators φˆ+ from the vacuum state |0i:\nk\nY\n(φˆ\nk\n+ )nk |0i\n|{nk}i ∝\nk\nSuch a state is an eigenstate of the total boson number operator ˆN = P\nk φˆ+ φˆk.

Since H is not quadratic in φˆk and φˆ\nk\n+ , H describes a collection of\nanharmonic quantum oscillators.

We do not need a classical vibrating brane\npicture to understand and to visualize the behavior of free bosons. However, an interacting boson\nsystem described by\n=\nX\n(-\ni + U) +\nX\nˆHn\n∂x\nV (xi - xj )\n(4.9.1)\n2m\ni\ni<j\n(or eqn (4.8.5)) is entirely a different matter. The interacting Hamiltonian eqn (4.9.1) is so hard\nto solve that we have no clue what do the low energy eigenstates and the eigenvalues look like. So\nhow can we understand the properties of the interacting bosons without being able to diagonalize\nthe Hamiltonian eqn (4.9.1)?\nOne way to understand interacting bosons is to find the corresponding classical system and\nstudy its low energy collective motions. Then we can quantize those low energy classical motions\nto obtain low energy quantum properties. This way, we can gain a understanding of the low energy\nproperties of the quantum interacting boson system.\nTo obtain the corresponding classical system for interacting bosons, let us first find out how to\nrepresent the boson density in the classical field theory. We know that if the potential U by δU,\nthe change in the total energy of the bosons will be δEtot = NδU where N is the total number of\nthe bosons. From eqn (4.7.3) we see that δEtot =\nR\nddx φ∗φδU. So the total number of the bosons\nis given by N =\nR\nddx φ∗φ in field theory and the boson density is\nn(x) = φ∗(x)φ(x)\nThe total potential energy can be rewritten in terms of the boson density\nX\nV (xi - xj ) =\nZ\ndd xdd x0\n2 n(x)V (x - x0)n(x0)\ni<j\nThis allows us to guess that the classical field theory for interacting bosons to have a modified total\nenergy\nZ\ndd xdd x0 φ(x) 2 V (x - x0)\n∂x\ndd\nφ(x0)\n(4.9.2)\nx φ∗\n+ U\nφ +\nEtot =\n-\n|\n|\n|\n|\n2m\nand hence a modified Lagrangian\nφ - φ∗\nφ\nx i φ∗φ - Etot\ni φ∗\ndd\ndd\n∂x + U\nL =\n=\n-\nx\n2m\n-\nZ\ndd xdd x0 |φ(x)|2 V (x\n- x0) |φ(x0)|\n(4.9.3)\nThe corresponding equation of motion can be obtained from L and is given by\ni φ (x, t) =\n∂x + Ueff(x)\nφ(x, t)\n- 2m\ndd x0\n0) φ(x0)\nUeff(x) = U +\nV (x - x\n(4.9.4)\n|\n|\nWe note that eqn (4.9.4) is a nonlinear equation.

In fact the\nclassical wave equation (4.9.4) can be \"derived\" using the equationofmotion approach described in section 2.6.1\nH ˆ\nH\nfrom the second quantized Hamiltonian (4.8.7).

Replace φˆ and φˆ+ by φˆ = φ and hφˆ+i = φ∗ to obtain the corresponding classical\nequation of motion.\n4.10\nA quantum phase transition in interacting boson system\nInstead of directly studying the very difficult quantum interacting boson system (4.9.1), in the\nnext a few sections, we will study the corresponding classical field theory (or the nonharmonic\nbrane) described by eqn (4.9.3). The classical field theory is much easier to deal with. The physical\nproperties of the classical field theory will give us some good ideas about the physical properties of\nthe quantum interacting bosons.\nSince it encodes both coordinates and momenta, the complex field φ describes a classical state\nin the classical field theory. That is each different complex function φ(x) correspond to different\nclassical state. So looking for a classical ground state is equivalent to looking for a complex function\nthat minimize the total energy (4.9.2).\nx\n∂xφ∗∂xφ\nWe note that a constant function minimize the kinetic energy term\nR\nddx φ∗-∂2 φ =\nR\nddx\n.\n2m\n2m\nSo if the interaction V is not too large, we may assume the function that minimize the total energy\nis a constant. In this case the energy density becomes\nu = U|φ|2 + 1 V φ 4\n2 | |\n\nwhere V ≡\nR\nddx V (x).\n\nWhen V < 0, we note that the total energy Etot =\nR\nddx u is not bound from below and has\nno minimum. So the ground state of boson gas with attractive interaction is well defined.3 When\n\nV > 0, we find that the total energy is minimized by the following field (or the classical state)\n(\n0,\nU > 0\nφgrnd =\n\n(4.10.1)\np\n-U/V , U < 0\nThis field corresponds to the classical ground state of the system. The ground state energy density\nis\n(\n0,\nU > 0\nu =\n\n(4.10.2)\n- 1 U2/V , U < 0\n3Here we just pointed out a mathematical inconsistence of a particular mathematical description of an attractive\nboson gas. It is interesting to think physically what really going to happen to a chamber of boson gas with an\nattractive interaction?\n\nRemember that U is the potential experienced by a boson and V characterize the interaction\nbetween two bosons. eqn (4.10.2) tells that how the ground state energy density depends on those\nparameters. Because the ground state is the state at zero temperature, how ground state energy\ndepends on those parameters will tell us if there are quantum phase transitions4 or not. As we\nchange the parameters that characterize a system, if the ground state energy changes smoothly,\nwe will say that there is no quantum phase transition. If the ground state energy encounter a\nsingularity, the singularity will represent a quantum phase transition. From eqn (4.10.2) we see\n\nthat there is a quantum phase transition at U = 0 if V > 0. Since it is the second order derivative\n∂2u/∂U2 that has a discontinuity, the phase transition is a second order phase transition. The\nphase for U > 0 contains no bosons since it cost energy have a boson. The phase for U < 0 has a\nnonzero boson density n = -U/V . This is because for negative U the system can lower its energy\nby having more bosons. But if there are too many bosons, there will be large cost of interaction\nenergy due to the repulsive interaction between the bosons. So the density n = -U/V is a balance\nbetween the potential energy due to U and the interaction energy due to V . Later we will see that\nthe phase with nonzero φ is a superfluid phase. It is also called the boson condensed phase.\nWe would like to remark that the eqn (4.10.2) is really the ground state energy density of\nthe classical field theory. It is an approximation of the real ground state energy density of the\ninteraction boson system. So we are not sure if the real ground state energy density contains a\nsingularity or not. Even if the singularity does exist, we are not sure if it is the same type as\ndescribed by eqn (4.10.2). A more careful study indicates that the real ground state energy density\nof the interaction boson system does have a singularity that is of the same type as in eqn (4.10.2)\nif the dimensions of the space is 2 or above. In 1D, the real ground state energy density has a\nsingularity at U = 0 but the form of the singularity is different from that in eqn (4.10.2).\n4.11\nContinuous phase transition and symmetry\n- Two mechanisms for phase transitions.\n- A continuous phase transition is a symmetry breaking transition.\n- The concept of order parameter.\nWe know that ground state energy (4.10.2) is obtained by minimizing the energy functional\n(4.9.2). U and V are the parameters in the energy functional. Can we have a more general and\na deeper understanding when the minimum of an energy functional has a singular dependence on\nthe parameters in the energy functional?\nLet us consider a simpler question: when the minimum of an energy function has a singular\ndependence on the parameters in the energy function? To be concrete, let us consider a real function\nparameterized by a, b, c, d (where d > 0):\nEabcd(x) = ax + bx2 + cx 3 + dx4\n(4.11.1)\nLet E0(a, b, c, d) be the minimum of Eabcd(x). How can the minimum E0(a, b, c, d) to have a singular\ndependence on a, b, c, d, knowing that the function Eabcd(x) itself has no singularity.\nOne mechanism for generating singularity in E0(a, b, c, d) is through the \"minima switching\" as\nshown in Fig. 4.9. When Eabcd(x) has multiple local minima, a singularity in the global minimum\nE0(a, b, c, d) is generated when the global minimum switch from a local minimum to another. The\nsingularities generated by \"minimumswitching\" always correspond to first order phase transitions\nsince the first order derivative of of the ground state energy E0 is discontinuous at the singularities.\n4A quantum phase transition, by definition, is a phase transition at zero temperature.\n\nx\nx\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\nb < 0\nb > 0\nb\nE 0\nE 0\nE 0\nE\nE\nb\nb\nx\nb\nE a\nE a\nE A\nE B\nE A\nE B\nE A\nE B\nx\nx\na\na < 0\na > 0\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\nFigure 4.9: The energy function Ea(x) ≡Ea,-1,0,1(x) = ax-x2 + x4 with b = -1, c = 0, and d = 1.\n(a) Ea(x) for a > 0 and (b) for a < 0. EA and EB are the energies of the two local minima. The\nglobal minimum switch from one local minima to the other as a passes 0. (c) The global minimum\nE0(a) has a singularity at a = 0.\nFigure 4.10: The energy function Eb(x) ≡E0,b,0,1(x) = bx2 + x4 with a = 0, c = 0, and d = 1 has\nx symmetry. (a) Eb(x) for b > 0 and (b) for b < 0. (c) The global minimum E0(b) has a\na x →-\nsingularity at b = 0.\nWhen energy function has a symmetry, there can be another mechanism for generating sin\ngularities in the ground state energy. The energy function Eabcd(x) has a x →-x symmetry if\na = c = 0. For such a symmetric energy function, the single minimum at the symmetric point x = 0\nfor positive b splits into two minima at x0 and -x0 as b decreases below 0 (see Fig. 4.10). The\nshifting from the single minimum to one of the two minima generate the singularity in ground state\nenergy E0(b) at b = 0. We will call such a mechanism \"minimumsplitting\". \"Minimumsplitting\"\nalways generate continuous phase transitions. This is because the minima before and after the\ntransition are connected continuously (see Fig. 4.11).\nWe would like to stress that the x →-x symmetry in the energy function E0b0d(x) is crucial\nfor the existence of the continuous transition caused by the \"minimumslitting\". Even a small\nsymmetry breaking term, such as the ax term, will destroy the continuous transition by changing\nit into a smooth crossover or a first order phase transition.\nWhen the energy function has a symmetry, one may expect that the minimum (i.e. the ground\nFigure 4.11: Trace of the positions of the minimum/maximum of Eb(x) as we vary b. The solid\nlines represent minima and the dash line represents the maximum. The single minimum for b > 0\nsplits continuously into two minima when b is lower below zero. The solid curve also shows how\nthe order parameter x becomes non zero after the phase transition.\n\nφ\nφ\nE( )\nFigure 4.12: The shape of the energy function (4.9.2) for a uniform φ when U < 0. The dot\n\nrepresents one ground state φ =\np\n-U/V and the think circle represents the infinitely many\n\ndegenerate ground states φ = e i θ p\n-U/V , 0 < θ < 2π.\nstate) also has the symmetry. In our example Fig. 4.10, when b > 0 the ground state of Eb (given\nby x = 0) indeed has the x →-x symmetry (see Fig. 4.10a). However, after the phase transition\n(i.e. when b < 0), the new ground state no longer have the x →-x symmetry despite the energy\nfunction continues to have the same symmetry. Under the x →-x transformation, the new ground\nstate is changed into another degenerate ground state (see Fig. 4.10b). This phenomenon of ground\nstate having less symmetry than the energy function is called spontaneous symmetry breaking. Our\nexample suggests that the continuous phase transition (caused by the \"minimumsplitting\") always\nchanges the symmetry of the ground state. So such a transition is also called symmetry breaking\ntransition.\nOur simple example (4.11.1) reflects a general phenomenon. The picture described above also\napplies to more general energy functional such as eqn (4.9.2). It is a deep insight by Landau [Landau\n1937; Landau and Lifschitz 1958] that the singularity in the ground energy (or the free energy) is intimately\nrelated to the spontaneous symmetry breaking. This leads to a general theory of phase and phase\ntransition based on symmetry and symmetry breaking. Within such a theory, we can introduce an\norder parameter to characterize different phases. The order parameter must transform nontrivially\nunder the symmetry transformation. In our example Fig. 4.10, we may choose x or x3 as the order\nparameter, since they both change signs under x →-x transformation. In the symmetry unbroken\nphase, the order parameter x = 0. In the symmetry breaking phase, the order parameter is non\nzero x = 0. The continuous phase transition is characterized by the order parameter acquiring a\nnonzero value. Landua's symmetry breaking theory is so general and so successful that for a long\ntime it was believed that all continuous phase transitions are described by symmetry breaking.\nIn our field theory description of interacting bosons, the energy functional (4.9.2) has many\nsymmetries, which include a U(1) symmetry φ\ne i θ φ and a translation symmetry x\nx + a.\n→\nThe phase φ = 0 (for U > 0) is invariant under both the transformations φ\ne i θ φ and x\n→\nx + a.\n\n→\n→\nThus the φ = 0 break no symmetries.

Under the U(1) transformation, φ =\np\n-U/\nV is changed to\n\nφ = e i θ p\n-U/V which corresponds to one of the infinitely many degenerate ground states (see Fig.\n4.12). According to Landau's symmetry breaking theory, the two phases, φ = 0 and φ = 0, having\ndifferent symmetries, must be separated by a phase transition.\nAfter understanding the above two mechanism which generate first order phase transitions and\ncontinuous phase transitions, one may wonder \"is there a third mechanism for the singularity in\nthe ground state energy?\" If you do find the third mechanism, it will represent a new type of phase\ntransitions beyond Landau's symmetry breaking theory!\nProblem 4.11.1\n\nμ\n¶\nZ\nμ\n¶\nZ\nμ\n¶\nμ\n¶\nShow that if we include a term h\nR\nddx (φ + φ∗) in the energy functional (4.9.2) to explicitly break the U(1)\nsymmetry, 5 the continuous transition cause by changing U will change into a smooth crossover no matter how\nsmall h is.\nProblem 4.11.2\nAdding h\nR\nddx (φ + φ∗) term in eqn (4.9.2) completely breaks the U(1) symmetry and destroys the continuous\nphase transition.

Those fluctuations are called sound waves.\nFor our interacting boson system (4.9.2), the (classical) ground states in the symmetric phase\n\nφgrnd = 0 and in the symmetry breaking phase φgrnd =\np\n-U/V are very different. As a result, the\ncollective excitations above the ground states are also very different.\nThe collective fluctuations around the ground state are described δφ = φ-φgrnd. The equation of\nmotion for δφ that describes the classical dynamics of the fluctuations can be obtain by substituting\nφ = δφ + φgrnd into eqn (4.9.4).\nTo simplify our calculation, we assume the interaction potential V (x -x0) is short ranged and\napproximate it by V (x -x0) = gδ(x -x0).

Substituting φ = δφ +\np\n-U/g into eqn (4.12.1),\nwe find\ni δφ =\n∂x -U δφ -Uδφ∗\n-2m\nSince we are interested in low lying fluctuations, we can assume δφ to be small. So in the above\nequation, we have only kept the terms linear in δφ. Separating δφ into real and imaginary part:\nChanging the symmetry of the energy functional (or the Hamiltonian) is called explicit symmetry breaking, which\nshould not be confused with the spontaneous symmetry breaking. A spontaneous symmetry breaking refers a change\nin the symmetry of the ground state with the symmetry of the energy functional (or Hamiltonian) unchanged.\n\n¶\nφ = √\n2 (δh + i δp), we rewrite the above equation as\nμ\n1 ∂2\n¶\n-δp =\nx -2U\nδh\n-2m\nδh = -2\nm∂2\nxδp\n\nFrom δh = - 1 ∂2 δp, we find\n2m x\nμ\n1 ∂2\n¶\n\nδh = 2m∂2\n-2m x -2U\nδh\n(4.12.4)\nx\nWe see that the equation of motion that describe the weak fluctuations is a linear wave equation.\nThe solutions of eqn (4.12.4) are of form δh = Re(C e i k x- i ωkt).

At the end, we\nω\nfind the low energy excitations of the interacting boson system are described by a free boson system.\nThe distinguish the two kinds of bosons, we will call the free bosons that describe the low lying\nexcitations emergent bosons.\nBut what are the emergent bosons? In the symmetric phase, the emergent bosons have the\nk\n| |\n2m\ndispersion ω\n+ U, which is exactly the same is the dispersion of the original bosons. In fact,\n=\nk\nin the symmetric phase, the emergent bosons are the original bosons. This is because the ground\nph\nk\nph\nk\nstate for the symmetry phase, |{n\nis identical to the occupation number n\n0}i is the state with no original bosons.\nof the original bosons. For the low energy excitations,\nin this case\n=\nn\nk\nph\nk\nonly few n\n's are nonzero, which correspond to a dilute gas of the original bosons. In this limit,\nthe interactions between the original bosons can be ignore and the original bosons become the free\nemergent bosons.\nHowever, in the symmetry breaking phase, the emergent bosons have a linear dispersion for\nph\nk\nof the\nsmall k's, which is very different from the original bosons. The occupation numbers n\nemergent bosons is not related to the occupation numbers nk of the original bosons. In fact, since\nφgrnd = 0 and the original bosons have a finite density, the interaction between the original bosons\ncannot be ignored. In this case, the occupation numbers nk of the original bosons are not even well\ndefined, i.e. the energy eigenstates do not have a definite occupation numbers nk (although they\nph\nk\ndo have a definite occupation numbers n\nfor the emergent bosons). Since the emergent bosons\nare completely different from the original bosons, we will give the emergent bosons a new name:\nphonons.\nWe note that phonons are gapless excitations above the superfluid ground state. We like to\n\npointed out that Gapless excitations are very rare in nature and in condensed matter systems.\nTherefore, if we see gapless excitations, we should to ask why do they exists?\nOne mechanism for gapless excitations is spontaneously breaking of a continuous symmetry. As\ndiscussed in section 4.11, the superfluid phase spontaneously break the U (1) symmetry: the energy\nfunctional has the U (1) symmetry: Etot[φ(x)] = Etot[e i θ φ(x)] while the ground state does not:\nφgrnd = e i θ φgrnd. Only in this case, do the gapless excitations exist.\nIntuitively if a symmetry (continuous or discrete) is spontaneously broken, then the ground\nstates must be degenerate (see Figs. 4.10b and 4.12). The different ground states are related by\nthe symmetry transformations. So the spontaneous breaking of continuous symmetry gives rise to a\ncontinuous manifold of degenerate ground states. The fluctuations between the degenerate ground\nstates correspond to the gapless excitations (see Fig. 4.13). Nambu and Goldstone have proved\na general theorem: if a continuous symmetry is spontaneously broken in a phase, the phase must\ncontain gapless excitations [Nambu 1960; Goldstone 1961]. Those gapless excitations are usually called the\nNambuGoldstone modes. The gapless phonon in the superfluid is a NambuGoldstone mode. In\nthe next section, we will give a explicit discussion of the relation between the spontaneous U (1)\nsymmetry breaking and the gapless phonons.\n4.14\n*An oscillator picture for the sound wave\n- A derivation of the oscillator picture for the sound wave allows us to\nexpress the physical quantities of the original bosons, such the boson den\nsity, in terms of the oscillator variables. This will allow us to calculate\nphysical properties of interacting bosons using simple oscillators.\nThe sound waves in the symmetry breaking phase are described by a collection of oscillators.\nTo show the explicit relation between the sound waves and a collection of oscillators, we start with\nthe field theory Lagrangian (4.12.3) for interacting bosons. Since the sound waves are described\nby the small fluctuations δφ = φ - φgrnd, we can rewrite (4.12.3) in terms of δφ to obtain the\nLagrangian for the sound waves. However, to make the U (1) symmetry: φ\ne i φφ more explicit,\n→\nwe will instead use (θ, ρ) to describe the fluctuations around the ground state φgrnd =\np\n-U/g.\n(θ, δn) are defined through\nφ(x, t) =\np\nn0 + δn(x, t) e i θ(x,t)\nwhere n0 = -U/g is the boson density in the ground state.\nTo the quadratic order in (θ, δn), eqn (4.12.3) becomes\nn0(∂xθ)2\n(∂xδn)2\ng\nL =\nZ\ndd x [-(n0 + δn)∂tθ -\n- 8mn0\n- 2 δn 2].\n(4.14.1)\n2m\nThe invariance of eqn (4.12.3) under the U (1) transformation φ\ne i φφ implies that eqn (4.14.1)\n→\nis invariant under θ(x, t) → θ(x, t) + φ. This is why the Lagrangian (4.14.1) contains no θ2 term.\nThe absence of the θ2 term, as implied by the U (1) symmetry, will leads to gapless excitations.\nIntroducing7\nδφ = 2√n0\nδn + i √n0θ\nwe can rewrite eqn (4.14.1) as\nμ ∂2\n¶\n¶\nx\nL =\nZ\ndd x\nμ\ni δφ∗δφ - δφ∗ - 2m + gn0 δφ - gn0Re(δφ2)\n.\n(4.14.2)\n7δφ defined this way is equal to δφ up to the linear order in δφ: δφ = δφ + O(δφ2).\n\n¶\n¶\nwhere we have dropped some total time derivative terms. The equal coefficient in the front of the\ntwo terms δφ∗δφ and Re(δφ2) is a consequence of the U(1) symmetry.\nLet us expand the above Lagrangian in terms of kmodes. We can expand φ(x) as\ni k\nδφ(x) =\nX\nV-1/2 e\n·xδφk\nk\nIn terms of φk, the Lagrangian for the sound wave takes a form\nL =\nX μ\ni δφ∗\nk\nμ |k| + gn0\n¶\nδφk - gn0 (δφ-kδφk + δφ∗\nk)\n.\n(4.14.3)\nkδφ k - δφ∗\n-kδφ∗\n2m\nk\nIf we ignore the term gn0 (δφ-kδφk + δφ∗ δφ∗\nk), then each term in the sum P\nk\n-k\nkδφ k - δφ∗\nLk = i δφ∗\nk\nμ |k| + gn0 δφk\n(4.14.4)\n2m\nwill describe a decoupled harmonic oscillator where the real part of δφk corresponds to the coor\ndinate and the imaginary part of δφk corresponds to the momentum of the oscillator. The term\ng\n2 (δφ-kδφk + δφ∗ δφ∗\n-k\nk) couples the oscillator k to the oscillator -k. So eqn (4.14.3) describes a\ncollection of coupled oscillators.\nBut we can choose a different set of variables to obtain a set of decoupled oscillators.

      "content": "Chapter 1\nStatistical Ensembles\n1.1\nPrinciple of statistical physics and ensembles\nKey points:\nAll possible states appear with an equal probability.\n-\nStatistical systems are complex systems. We do not know all the information that is needed to\ncompletely characterize the systems. For example, the liter of gas may contain 1022 atoms. The\ncompletely characterize such a system we need to known the three components of the velocity for\neach atoms and the three components of the position for each atoms. It is impossible to obtain\n6 × 1022 real numbers to completely characterize the gas.\nHowever, not knowing all the information needed to characterize gas does not prevented us to\ndevelop a theory of gas. This is because we are only interested in some average properties of gas\nsuch as the pressure, volume, temperature. Those properties do not depend on every little details of\neach atoms. Not knowing every thing about the atoms does not prevent us from calculating those\nproperties. This is the kind of problems facing statistical physics. In statistical physics we try to\nunderstand the properties of a complex system without know all the information of the systems.\nThis is possible since the properties we are interested in do not depend on the details of the system.\nIn statistical physics there is only one principle: All possible states appear with an equal proba\nbility. Let us explain what do we mean by the above statement. Suppose we know certain properties\nof a complex systems. But those properties do not characterize the system completely. That means\nthe system has a numbers of states that all have the same properties. Thus even after knowing\nthose properties, we still do not know, among those possible states, which state the system is in.\nAccording to the principle of statistical physical, we say all the possible states are equally likely.\nBut the system can only be in one state at a given time. What do we mean by \"all the possible\nstates are equally likely\"? There are two points of view. In the first point of view, we may imagine\nwe have many copies of the system, all have the same properties. But each copy may be in a\ndifferent possible states. Then \"equally likely\" means that each possible state appear the same\nnumber of times among the copies of the system. The copies of the system is called ensemble. We\nhave to have an ensemble to even define the probabilities. Under the first interpretation, statistical\nphysical is a science that deal with ensembles, rather than individual systems.\nThe second point of view only apply to the situation where the properties of the system is\nindependent of time. In this case we interpret \"equally likely\" as that all the possible states appear\n\nfor the same amount of time during a long period of time. The second point of view is related to\nthe first point of view if we view the system at different times as the different copies of the system.\nThe second point of view may be equivalent to the first point of view. The two points of view\nare equivalent only when the system can visit all the possible states, many times, during the long\nperiod of time. This is the ergodic hypothesis. Not all systems are ergodic. In this class, we will\ntake the first point of view. We regard the statistical physics as a theory for ensembles. We will\napply the theory for ensembles to individual systems, assuming the systems are ergodic.\n1.2\nMicrocanonical ensemble\nA microcanonical ensemble is an ensemble formed by isolated systems. All the systems in the\nensemble have the same energy (and possibly some other properties). Here by \"same energy\" we\nreally mean all systems has an energy which lies within a small window between E and E + ΔE.\n1.2.1\nNumber of states and entropy\nA simple example: N spins in magnetic field.

This is the Curie's law (see Fig. 1.4).\n1.2.4\nProperties of entropy\nEntropy is an extensive quantity\nFrom\nk-1S(E) =N\n£\n-(1 +\n) ln(\n+\n) -(2 -20\n) ln(\n(1.2.15)\nB\n2 -20\n)\n¤\nwe see that entropy is proportional to N, the size of system. Thus S is extensive quantity. In\ncontrast, 2, as the average energy per spin, is intensive quantity. The total energy E is a extensive\nquantity and the temperature T is an intensive quantity.\nEntropy and energy window\nFrom the definition of entropy\nS(E, ΔE) = kB ln(number of states with energy between E and E + ΔE)\n(1.2.16)\nwe see that entropy also depend on the energy window ΔE. However, in the thermodynamical\nlimit N →inf, such a dependence can be dropped and we can regard S as a function of E only.\nTo see this, we consider\nS(E, αΔE) =kB ln(number of states with energy between E and E + αΔE)\n=kB ln[α × (number of states with energy between E and E + αΔE)]\n=S(E, ΔE) + kB ln α\n(1.2.17)\nSince S(E, ΔE) ∼N, as long as α = O(Nn), kB ln α term can be dropped.\n\nE\nE\nE2\nE1\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\n2 E\nE\nE1\nE\nΓ(\n)\nE\nΓ(\n)\nE1\nΓ(\n) Γ(\n)\nE2\nFigure 1.5: Total entropy of combined systems.\nFigure 1.6: Total numbers of states in the combined system with the total energy 2 E and the\nsystem 1 energy E1.\nAdditive property of entropy\nConsider two systems both with N spins. The first system has total energy E1 and the second E2.\nE2/20\nThe first system has Γ1 =\nE1/20 ≡ Γ(E1) possible states and the second Γ2 =\n= Γ(E2)\nCN\nCN\npossible states.\nIf we put the two systems together, but forbid any exchange of energy between them (see Fig.\n1.5a), then the combined system will has Γ = Γ1Γ2 possible states. The entropy of the combined\nsystem S = kB ln Γ is the sum of the sub systems\nS = S1 + S2\n(1.2.18)\nIf we allow the two system to exchange energy, the two systems will reach an equilibrium state.\n\nThe subsystem will have the same average energy E = (E1 + E2)/2 in the equilibrium state. The\nequilibrium state of the combined system will have a total energy 2 E. The number of possible states\n2E/20\n\nE - E1), it is clear that the\nbecome Γ = C2N\n. Since Γ = P\nE1 Γ(E1)Γ(2\nΓ > Γ = Γ(E1)Γ(E2)\nand the equilibrium state has a higher entropy (see Fig. 1.6). Thus reaching equilibrium always\nincrease entropy (the second law of thermodynamics).\nAfter the two systems reach the equilibrium, we now forbid the energy exchange. The total\nnumber states is then reduced to\n\nE). We like to show that ln Γ( E)Γ(\nΓ in the\nΓ0 = Γ(E)Γ(\n\nE) = ln\nthermodynamical limit, ie the system Fig. 1.5b and the system Fig. 1.5c have the same entropy.\n\nΓ0\n\nAs the maximum of the Γ(E1)Γ2(E - E1), we find > Γ/2N, where 2N is the number of possible\ndistinct values of E1. We also have < Γ. Thus\nΓ0\n\nln\nΓ0 > ln(\nΓ > ln\nΓ/2N)\n(1.2.19)\nor\n\nS > S0 > S - kB ln(2N)\n(1.2.20)\n\nE\n4 states\n7 states\n4 states\n4 states\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure 1.7: The lines represent possible states. The thick lines represent states that actually appear\nin the ensembles.\n\nSince SS and S0 is of order N. In large N limit, we can regard S = S0.\nFrom Fig. 1.6 we also see that as system go from Fig. 1.5a to the equilibrium state Fig. 1.5b\nor Fig. 1.5c, the entropy of the system is maximized. Or equilibrium state has maximum entropy.\nReversible and irreversible processes\nThe system in Fig. 1.5b is evolved from that in Fig. 1.5a. Thus there are only Γ(E1)Γ(E2) possible\ninitial states, and there will be only Γ(E1)Γ(E2) possible final states. Those the system Fig. 1.5b\n\nhas Γ states with energy 2E, it will only be in one of Γ(E1)Γ(E2) possible final states. But we have\nno clue about which are the Γ(E1)Γ(E2) possible final states. We lost the information. We only\n\nknow the total energy of the system, and we only know the state can be in one of the Γ states.\nThis is how the entropy get increased.\nThe evolution from Fig.\n1.5a to Fig.\n1.5b is also presented in Fig.\n1.7a.\nThe Fig.\n1.7b\nrepresent a reversible (or adiabatic) evolution, say, caused by a change in 20. We see that reversible\n(or adiabatic) processes do not change the entropy, since the number of possible states is not\nchanged.\n1.3\nApplication to classical ideal gas\nEach degree of freedom is described by a point in phase space (q, p). A particle has three degrees\nof freedom and its state is described by (x, px, y, py , z, pz ).\nConsider a Nparticle system. How many states with total energy below E. The answer is\ninfinity. We need quantum physics to get a sensible result. Each state in a degree freedom occupies\na finite area ΔqΔp = h. For the N particle system, the phase space is 6N dimensional. Each h3N\nvolume in the 6N dimensional phase space correspond to one state. Thus the number of states\nwith total energy below E is given by\nV N S3N (\n√\n2mE)3N /3N\n(1.3.1)\np\nN<(E) = h3\nN\nZ\nP\nd3N qd3N p =\ni /2m<E\nh3N\n\nwhere Sn is the solid angle in n dimension and\nR R Snrn-1dr = SnRn/n is the volume of a n\ndimensional ball of radius R. The number states between E and E + ΔE is\nΓ(E) = N<(E + ΔE) - N<(E) = V N S3N (\n√\n2mE)3N -2\nΔE\n(1.3.2)\n2h3N\nTo obtain Sn, we note\nZ\ndn xe-x2 =\nZ\nSnr n-1dre-r\n= Sn\nZ\n(r 2)(n-2)/2dr2 e-r2\n= SnΓ(n/2) = πn/2\n(1.3.3)\nWe find that\n2πn/2\nSn =\n(1.3.4)\nΓ(n/2)\nThe entropy can now be calculated as\nk-1S(E)\nB\n3N\n=N ln N + N ln v +\nln N + 3N ln((2m2)1/2/h) + 3N ln √π - 3\nN ln(3N/2) + 3N/2 + ln ΔE\nv(2m2)3/2\n2π\n=N ln N + N ln\n+ N (\nln 3 + 2) + ln ΔE\n(1.3.5)\nh3\nwhere v = V /N is the volume per particle and 2 = E/N is the average energy per particle.\nA big problem, the entropy is NOT extensive due to the N ln N term.
