Would you like to try teaching, but are nervous about whether you will be any good at it? Are you interested in new research on science education? If so, 7.391 is the course for you!\n\n7.391 is a weekly seminar on science education open to both graduate and undergraduate students. Participants will read primary literature on science education, uncover basic concepts often overlooked when teaching biology, and lead a small weekly discussion session for students in MIT course 7.02. Students will be encouraged to review lecture material posted on the web for 7.014 or attend review sessions for 7.02 to obtain a first-hand view of the material being covered. Current students will be paired with mentors from last semester's course.\n\nResearch in science education shows that the greatest obstacle to student learning is the failure to identify and confront the misconceptions with which the students enter the class or those that they acquire during their studies. This course focuses on developing the participants' ability to uncover and confront student misconceptions and to foster student understanding and retention of key concepts.\n\nParticipants are encouraged to remain in the program as mentors for the fall semester.\n\nCourse Format\n\nThe course will have three components, reading primary literature in science education, discussing key concepts in select areas of biology, and leading a discussion group for the students taking Introductory Biology lab or lecture (7.014 or 7.02).\n\nWe will discuss at least one original paper each week. The papers must be read in advance of the class. Our goal will be to critically analyze these papers. To help us achieve that goal, each of you will be expected to email to the instructor two discussion questions for the article covered that day by the morning of the class. In discussing the papers, we will focus on articulating the main points of the paper, identifying conditions under which the data was collected and assumptions used in interpreting the data, and discussing how the results could be applied to the teaching environment at MIT.\n\nStarting in the third week of class, seminar participants will lead a small (no more than 5 students) discussion groups for students enrolled in 7.014 or 7.02. There will be one session of each discussion group a week and each session will last approximately an hour. A mentor from last semester's class will be partnered with you to help facilitate the discussion. Students leading discussions for 7.02 will be required to attend bi-weekly meetings with the 7.02 staff to orient themselves with the material to be presented. Students leading discussions for 7.014 will be asked to attend lecture if possible or review old lecture material.\n\nAttendance\n\nThis is a discussion class, so attendance is mandatory. You are allowed to miss one of the 15 sessions of the class, but please notify the instructors ahead of time. You will also need to arrange to pick up the paper for the next week from the course instructor. If you need to miss a second class, you must talk to the instructors ahead of time so we can arrange an appropriate make-up assignment.\n\nAssignments\n\nClass participants are required to lead a discussion session with currently enrolled introductory biology students. There are writing assignments based on preparation work for these discussion sessions. Participants will also be required to give several oral presentations on class readings and run a selected concept discussion during a portion of the seminar.\n\nGrading\n\nThe course is pass/fail. Participation in class discussion, completion of the assignments above, and satisfactory attendance will result in a passing grade.",

The MIT BCF\n\n1. Should students be given this framework of organized topics? Why or why not?\n\n2. Is this framework useful for others outside the realm of MIT? Why or why not?\n\n3. How is this method of topic organization useful? What is problematic about it?\n\n4. The suggestion was made to increase the scope of the BCF to include upper level\nclasses like genetics, biochemistry and molecular biology? How feasible is this\nplan? Do you think having a BCF for upper level classes would be useful?\n\nII. Using the Concept Framework idea in the outside world\n\n1. How do you chose what concepts should be included? Is the list exhaustive in\nterms of details or does it just deal with major concepts and issues?\n\n2. Who should provide input as to what gets included in the framework? Do you\nthink the input of nonbiologists is useful? If not, why? If so, in what way(s)?\n\n3. Producing a framework like this seems like a really good exercise for\ninstructors to do to make themselves tease apart the many concepts they want\nto teach, prioritize them, and communicate them to their fellow teachers,\nbut it is also a lot of work. Can you reach most of the same goals\nby conceptual teaching without an organized framework or not? How?\n\nMSKC 2006\n\n4. Should we have a national biology curriculum? If so, what topics should a\nnational curriculum include? How would we assess that all of our students were\ngetting all the information?\n\n5. Should all students be required to learn the same \"core\" group of biology topics?\n\n6. People have begun to suggest standardized tests should be used at the\nlevel. Could frameworks like this be used as the foundation for better\nstandardized tests, ones that could focus on conceptual learning rather than\nregurgitation? How hard would it be to get a broad consensus on what biological\nconcepts students should master if, say, a national college-level biology exam\nwere to be written?\n\n7. Is it valuable to have a majors class and non-majors class? Would the non-majors\nbe better served by getting the hierarchical concepts in a class that relates to\neveryday life and how it relates to biology?\n\n8. Is it better to test cross-referenced concepts together or to test concepts in a\nhierarchical manner? Is there a preference for students to learn in one particular\nmanner?\n\n9. As students many of us have been condition to learn my memorization, Do\nstudents have a hard time adjusting to learning by this concept-mapping\ntechniques?"

Are the assessment methods\nappropriate?\n\n3. How were the questions to test misconceptions formulated? How do you pin-\npoint misconceptions if you do not know what your students do not understand?\n\n4. Because different scientific disciplines teach the same processes, like diffusion\nand osmosis, from different angles, can we write exams that keep in mind all the\ndifferent views of the same processes?\n\n5. How could we apply the conceptual change method to larger classroom settings?\n\n6. Is the conceptual change method a new way of teaching, or just a way of\nsystematically doing what effective teachers do automatically?\n\n7. Can such a method be used by high school teachers that were only forced to\n\"know\" material in college, and never really came to \"understand\" the material\nthemselves?\n\n8. How do you delineate between what people \"know\" and what they \"understand\"?"
