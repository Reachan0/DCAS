      "content": "The Dual Ladder\n:Review and personal perspective\nCheolmin Park\nDhiman Bhattacharjee\n\nWhy do we need the Dual Ladder?\nProfessional specialists have own set of attitudes\nand aspirations\nTheir values and definitions differ from traditional\nmanagerial setting\nDilemma with companies to develop compensation\nand career systems that recognize both employee\nand corporate needs\nCompanies adopt dual-ladder to provide career\npaths for professionals separately from those for\nmanagers or administrators.\n\nDo all professionals prefer a technical\nladder?\nDegree of preference\nvaries with the nature of work\nperformed by the individual\nprofessional\nvaries with the level of education of the\nindividual (B.S., M.S., Ph.D.)\nVaries with the age of the professional\n\nAre companies implementing the dual\nladder?\nSelected 2 companies of 2 different industry\nComputer product and services firm\nChip design and manufacturing firm\nSent questionnaire with 6 questions to the\nHR of those firms\nFollowed it up with interviews with the HR\nrepresentatives\n\nQ1: Describe the Dual ladder mechanism.\nWhy do we want it?\nComputer services firm's HR\n\nThere is no fixed ladder for technical persons.\n\nThe company tries to identify key talents within every business unit\n\nExposes them to areas of the business.\n\nThis gives opportunities to the technical people to develop skills needed for\nthe next step\nChip design and manufacturing firm's HR (only focus on the difference)\n\nTradition has been valuing technical persons higher than traditional business\ntype of employee by\n\nTechnical department has more power\n\nPromoting engineers faster than business unit's employee\n\nMore general managers with engineering background than business background\n\nMany of high profile technical position peoples does managements\n\nNot only normal business persons in the technical department but also entire\ncompany's business persons need paths to grow up\n\nQ2. Why do we want the dual ladder?\nComputer services firm's HR\n\nIt depends upon skills and requirements.\n\nThe company recognizes the senior individual contributors.\n\nThere are people who like to work on cutting edge staff and that are what\nthey are most interested on.\n\nCompany values their contribution and encourages them further by\nrecognizing their contributions.\nChip design and manufacturing firm's HR (only focus on the difference)\n\nWe need a growth opportunity in the organization as engineers do.\n\"Many other tracks simply stop at a much lower level (e.g., QA, support,\noperations, tech writing)\"\n\"I have looked at the Principal Engineers in my area. And they are all almost\nwithout exception managers - and have been managers of large groups (20\n100) - I feel like I should be able to be a leader and a technical expert\nwithout having to do that\"\n\nQ3: How should it be run?\nComputer services firm's HR\n\nNeed to look at the business and business model.\n\nIt is only from there that you can determine how to handle people skills and\ntheir individual requirements.\n\nSome people view a career path as higher salary and promotion\n\nSome see a career path as being involved in cutting edge technology.\n\nLadder should be aligned with the requirement of the business model in\nmind.\nChip design and manufacturing firm's HR & technical persons\ndiscussion\n\n\"The evaluation processor is inconsistent since we may have super group A\nand inferior group B but ranked with the group\" (technical person)\n\n\"There is no way to accommodate this. You may not agree with how the org\nwas sliced/diced into these rank groups, just as you may not agree with the\nlatest & greatest re-org, but there is reason behind the madness\" (HR\nmanager)\n\nQ4. Do we deviate from the ideal?\nComputer services firm's HR\nOur goal is to support the business by hiring and retaining\nthe best and the brightest people working for the\norganization.\nSo employees would also look into the requirements of the\nbusiness and give their best for the organization\nChip design and manufacturing firm's HR &\ntechnical persons discussion\n\"Just because there is a \"documented\" technical ladder\ndoesn't mean it is functional\" (technical person)\n\"statement there is no technical ladder is flat out wrong as\nPrincipal Engineers are in all organizations.\" (HR manager)\n\nQ5. Do you think that people are\nsatisfied?\nComputer services firm's HR\nDo not feel extremely qualified to answer this.\nI know of people who are very happy in their jobs and have been\nwith the company for a long time and enjoy what they do.\nI also know that some are not so happy.\nThe not so happy is for a variety of reasons, not necessarily only\ncareer path\nChip design and manufacturing firm's HR & technical persons\ndiscussion\n\"if there is so much confidence from HR teams on the managers\npracticing fair promotion, why don't they attempt to conduct a\nemployee satisfaction survey\" (individual contributor)\n\"Without this process, We would not be the company it is today.\nAnyway, you guys are valued higher\" (HR manager)\n\nQ6. If you think we should change\nanything, what would be that?\nComputer services firm's HR\nThings look good as it stands with scope of improvement.\nOne proposal is to identify key talents at every business\nunit and nurture them to gain skills needed for the next\nstep.\nThe other is to create better opportunities for technical\npeople to train themselves in the latest technologies as\nmay be required by their job function.\nThe third is to create a process to constantly review\nbenefits and pay structures so that employees are self\nmotivated.\n\nTakeaways\nComputer services firm\nThis company understands the requirement of dual ladder\nVery focused on alignment with the business needs\nLadders are often found in organizations where research is highly\nvisible or strategically important\nSince this is a computer services firm, more emphasis on\nmanagement ladder.\nChip design and manufacturing firm\nTechnical department has been at the powerful position but\npower seems to move to finance and marketing department\nUnderstand the need of dual ladder but slightly different\ninterpretation between HR and engineering\nMay need more research on dual ladder regarding how it is\nimplemented, what level of satisfaction upon people's desire and\nso on."

Groups produce more creative\nideas than individuals do.\n- 2. Groups produce more creative\nideas than individuals do.\n\n15.980J/ESD.933J\nSpring 2007\nTwo Conclusions\n- Groups produce more creative ideas\nthan individuals do.\n- Groups produce more creative

in which it is developed.\n- Technical problems are thus defined in terms\nof that culture and its system of values.\n\n15.980J/ESD.933J\nSpring 2007\nThe Local Nature of Technology\n- This implies that:\n- Anyone outside of the organization cannot fully\nunderstand the way that those within the\norganization define technical problems without\nunderstanding the organization's culture.\n- This difficulty in understanding the problem is the\nprincipal barrier to technology transfer.\n- Barriers of this sort arise any time that we try to\ntransfer knowledge across organizational\nboundaries.\n- It thus holds true for internal communication as well\nas communication with other organizations.\n- It is one of the causes of poor interfunctional\nrelations in organizations.\n\n15.980J/ESD.933J\nSpring 2007\nInternal Problems\n- There are boundaries inside the\norganization that can cause as much\ndifficulty (sometimes more) as the\nexternal boundary:\n-

there are really only two basic structures\nthat can be combined in many ways.\n- Product Development managers have been very\ninnovative in combining these two forms into very\nelaborate organizational structures.\n- There has, however, been very little rational\nbasis for choosing among these structures.\n\nDepartmental Organization\nD1\nD6\nD2\nD3\nD4\nD5\nTechnology\nMarket\nWeak

managed to lessen\ncoordination needs by extending\ndevelopment time.\n\nTime & Coordination\n- The biggest problem with departmental\norganization is the difficulty in\ncoordinating the work across the\ndifferent departments.\n- But coordination is less necessary,\ngiven sufficient time.\n- Some industries have managed to lessen\ncoordination needs by extending\ndevelopment time.\n\nD1\nD2\nD3\nD4\nD5\nTechnology\nMarket\nOne Approach to Managing Departmental Organization\n\nTime & Coordination\n\nTime & Coordination\n\nAn Alternative Approach\n- Beginning with Aerospace
