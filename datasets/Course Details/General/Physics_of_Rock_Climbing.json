  "course_description": "SP.255 is a lecture, discussion, and project based seminar about the physics of rock climbing. Participants are first exposed to the unsolved problems in the climbing community that could be answered by research and then asked to solve a small part of one of these problems. The seminar provides an introduction to engineering problems, an opportunity to practice communication skills, and a brief stab at doing some research. This seminar explicitly does not include climbing instruction nor is climbing/mountaineering experience a prerequisite.",

      "content": "Experimental Verification of a Simple Model for Transverse Vibration in a\nTensioned Rope\n\nDave Custer's write-up of ES255 experimental work\nconducted by Dany, Rod, and Elizabeth\n\nSummary To verify the model of rope oscillation developed in ES255 class on Feb 13, a rope\nwas tensioned and plucked like a guitar string. The rope length and weight, the length of the\ntensioned rope segment, the tension, and the number of cycles were recorded. The measured\nfrequency was then compared to the frequency predicted by the model. Even though these\ntests were conducted at tensions well below those expected during climber fall arrest, 60 %\n(1 σ) of the experimental results are were within 6% of the prediction and no results differed\nby more than 13%. The close match between the model and the experimental data suggests\nthat the model provides an accurate enough prediction of the frequency of oscillation to\nmake recommendations on fall geometries that might be prone to coupling energy from an\noscillating rope into a carabiner gate.\n\nIntroduction\nIn order to determine whether oscillating ropes can couple energy into carabiner gates to\nprecipitate open gate carabiner failure, it would be handy to be able to predict the oscillation\nfrequency of a length of rope under the conditions expected during climber fall arrest. A\nsimple model has been developed to predict rope oscillation frequency\n(available with the first session in the lecture notes section ); this research\ndetermines how close the model is to experimental results.\n\nMethods\n\nBasically, lengths of rope were tensioned with weights and plucked like a guitar strings. The\nrope length, tensioning weight, time, and number of oscillations were recorded. The rope's\nlinear density was determined by measuring the rope's weight and length and then dividing.\nWith only slight modifications, 4 different combinations of weight and length were tested:\n25 lbs/284 in, 50 lbs/288 in, 25 lbs/448 in, and 25 lbs/446 in. (Would be nice to have a figure\nhere.)\n\nResults\n\nThe linear density, recorded lengths, tensions, times, & cycles are listed in Appendix 1 along\nwith the resulting measured frequency of oscillation, which is compared with the model. In\ngeneral the measured results are close to the predicted results. The standard deviation of the\nratio of measured to predicted frequency is 6%; thus, one would expect 99% of measured\nfrequencies to be within 18% of the predicted frequency.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe model for rope oscillation frequency is pretty good. We can use it to predict fall\ngeometries that are prone to coupling rope oscillations into carabiner gate oscillation.\nRope Oscillation, Experimental Results\n\npage 1 of 2\n\nAppendix 1: spread sheet results\n\nanalysis of rope oscillation data taken on Monday, March 20, 2006 by Dany, Rod, & Elizabeth\nrope linear density = 0.07 kg/m (7.25 lbs/155.5 ft)\nLength (in)\nWeight\n(lbs)\nTime (s)\nCycles\nObserved ω\nObserved/\nModel ω\n16.98\n0.978\n18.85\n1.085\n18.22\n1.049\n17.59\n1.013\n17.80\n1.025\n16.55\n0.966\n17.17\n1.003\n16.34\n0.954\n22.83\n0.939\n21.99\n0.905\n23.04\n0.948\n21.15\n0.870\n23.04\n0.948\n21.57\n0.887\n21.99\n0.905\n11.10\n1.008\n10.26\n0.932\n11.52\n1.046\n11.73\n1.065\n11.94\n1.084\n11.52\n1.046\n11.52\n1.046\n11.52\n1.046\n15.29\n0.977\n15.08\n0.964\n14.87\n0.951\n14.66\n0.937\n16.13\n1.031\n15.08\n0.964\n15.08\n0.964\n15.29\n0.977\n14.66\n0.937\n\nRope Oscillation, Experimental Results\n\npage 2 of 2\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\nES.255 Physics of Rock Climbing\nSpring 2006\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

      "content": "Development of a Simple Model for Transverse Vibration in a Tensioned Rope\nDave Custer's post class thoughts for Feb 13, 2006\n\nFigure 1a shows an oscillation in a top rope. I suspect the photo was taken right as slack\nwas pulled in; as the camera-man, my intention was to photograph the climber, not the\noscillation.\n\nThe basic premise for calculating the frequency of oscillation is the one that I set up in\nclass is used here. I look at the tiny little piece of the rope in the middle (Figure 1b) and\npresume that the oscillation is the fundamental or first harmonic (Figure 1c). I invoke\nNewton's 2nd law, F=ma. The distance the middle of the rope is from the vertical line is\nproportional to the acceleration & the signs are opposite. The math is developed in\nTable 2. Differences between the result developed in class and the result presented here\nare due to the assumption in class that the shape of the \"plucked\" rope is \"triangular.\"\nHere, the \"shape\" of the oscillating rope is assumed to be sinusoidal.\n\nFig 1a Rope oscillation\nrecorded in situ\nFig 1b Forces on the tiny middle\nof the rope\nFig 1c Assumed\n\"shape\" of oscillation\n\nSome observations on this text: The genre is not clear, but it might be an example of what\nyou might produce in this seminar, something akin to a problem set solution.

      "content": "A Summary of ES.255 Class 3, Feb 27, 2006\n\nWe did was some brainstorming on all three aspects, modeling, gate oscillation\nmeasurement, and rope oscillation measurement. The blackboard as it was at the end of\nclass is shown in Fig. 1. I apologize if I did not give specific credit where it is due; if such\noccurs it is because I am reconstructing the conversation from memory.\n\nPhilippe observes that if this work shows the possibility that the oscillating rope can\ncouple energy into the carabiner gate then he will quit climbing. Dave C says there may\nbe other alternatives, for instance increasing the open gate strength of carabiners or\neducating climbers about the situations that lead to coupling.\n\nExisting Data from the Literature:\n\nThere is some data from drop tests available in the literature. It would be handy to eyeball\nthe data and compare it to the modeling results.\n\nModeling:\n\nSo far, Dave C had only been thinking about the frequency at which resonance occurs;\nDany suggests that the carabiner gate damping might produce a lower Q value and thus\nextend the range of frequencies over which coupling is significant. A model ought to\ninclude info on resonant frequency, Q, and the number of cycles during which a\nsignificant amount of energy can be transmitted from the rope to the carabiner gate.\nIncluding the damping suggests that carabiners that get dirty or corroded (& thus better\ndamped) might be more prone to chattering open.\n\nOne expects that if this coupling is to cause problems, then it must occur at about the\npoint where the carabiner gate locks up under load.\n\nThere are two parts of the carabiner gate chatter cycle. In one part, the oscillation is\ngoverned by the spring and the gate inertia; in the other, the gate impacts the carabiner\nbody and rebounds. How these two spring parts combine into one \"frequency\" is not\nclear.\n\nDave C says he expects carabiner frequencies on the order of a 10th of a second to a 60th\nof a second, based on having observed high speed video & done some spread sheet\nestimates.\n\nRope Oscillation Measurement:\n\nRod suggests use of piezos to measure oscillation, but is not sure how to incorporate them\ninto a rope. They are easy to salvage from headphone speakers or perhaps keyboards.\nRequires preamp and amplifier to boost 10 mV signals.\n\nHigh speed video? How high does the speed need to be?\nES.255 Class 3 Summary\n\n1 of 4\n\nIt will be important to be able to control the conditions, perhaps hard for drop situation.\n\nTension measurement: If doing drop tests, it would be nice to measure tension vs. time.\n\nThe tension in the rope can be measured with a load cell. The change in tension due to\nthe rope vibration is so small compared to the tension in the rope that the vibration is\nprobably not measurable from the tension data.\n\nFor a static test (like a guitar string, not like a drop), the tension can be controlled by\ntying known weights to the bottom of a suspended rope.\n\nCarabiner Gate Oscillation Measurement:\n\nPiezzos might work well here.\n\nPerhaps wiring up an ohmic contact (switch or variable resistance) between the carabiner\nbody and the gate to detect chatter.\n\nPerhaps glue accelerometer to the carabiner during a drop to measure oscillations of the\ncarabiner. High speed video might be grand too.\n\nPerhaps drive a carabiner with a speaker coil. Allows frequency sweeping.\nPerhaps drive the carabiner with a stepper motor or other motor.\n\nAnother idea would be to use faraday's law & eddy currents to determine whether the\ngate is open or not. Capacitive sensing might work too. Doing so might make it possible\nto not mount the measurement device on the carabiner.\n\nQuick Low Speed Video of Carabiner Gate Opening:\n\nWe took 60 frame/sec video footage of carabiners being thwacked against the table. In\nmost of the footage, we could identify a single frame in which the carabiner gate is open\n(Fig. 2). We conclude that the frequency of gate oscillation is a little higher than 60 Hz.\nOne implication is that we'll need a higher frame rate to actually measure opening times\nand to see when/whether gates are open.\n\nES.255 Class 3 Summary\n\n2 of 4\n\nFigure 1 The blackboard at the end of class, Feb 27, 2006\nES.255 Class 3 Summary\n\n3 of 4\n\nFigure 2 Video frame with carabiner gate open\n\nES.255 Class 3 Summary\n\n4 of 4\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\nES.255 Physics of Rock Climbing\nSpring 2006\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

      "content": "Analytical model of a rope and karabiner system\nBy Philippe Bertreau and Chris Pipe\n1. Introduction\nVarious climbing accidents involving the failure of karabiners with their gate open have\nbeen reported. Karabiner gates are kept closed by the restoring force of a mechanical\nspring, and, in the case of locking karabiners, with the additional mechanism of a\nthreaded sleeve that 'locks' the gate shut (see below). Karabiners that fail with their gate\nopen clearly either belong to the former category or the latter in an unlocked position.\nThere is also another class of karabiners with wire gates instead of solid gates, although\nwe have no information on whether they have been found to fail with their gate open in a\nclimbing environment.\nThat karabiners fail with their gate open is not surprising given that the tensile strength of\na karabiner with an open gate is typically 7 kN as opposed to 25 kN for a karabiner with\nthe gate closed. What is less obvious is how the gate was open when the karabiner failed.\nThe two possible scenarios involve the gate being open before the fall which caused\nfailure of the karabiner, or whether the act of falling itself in some way led to the opening\nof the gate and the subsequent failure of the karabiner. The aim of this analytical study is\nto investigate whether the karabiner gate could by excited and induced to open by\noscillation of the rope.\nStraight gate karabiner\nLocking karabiner\nWire gate karabiner\n3. Estimate of physical properties\n3.1 Natural frequency of a karabiner gate\nThe restoring force in the karabiner gate is assumed to be perfectly elastic and the natural\nfrequency of the system, i.e. the frequency at which the response of the system is greatest\nin relation to the forcing function, is found from the equation of motion:\n\nAnalytical model of a rope and karabiner system\nMay 2006\n,\nwhere J0 is the moment of inertia and C is the spring constant. This second order\ndifferential equation with constant coefficients has a solution of the form:\n,\nwhere θmax is the amplitude of oscillation, ω is the natural frequency, and φ is the phase\nshift. Thus we can calculate ω :\n.\nEstimate of spring constant C\nThe strength of the spring was found by measuring the force F=Mg required to hold the\nspring open at an angle θ0. This was carried out by attaching a known mass M to the end\nof the karabiner gate using dental floss and θ0 was estimated from a digital photo using\nAdobe Photoshop. Thus C is estimated as:\ncos(\n)\n0.63\n0.8\nMgL\nC\n!\n!\n=\n=\n±\n-1\nNm.rad\nO\nθ\nM\nL\nFigure\nEstimate of moment of inertia J0\nThe moment of inertia J0 of the gate about the hinge (point 0 shown in figure 1) is given\nby:\nas we take the gate to be a cylinder in first approximation.\n\nl is the length of the solid cylinder part of the karabiner gate. l=4.0cm±0.1mm\n\nAnalytical model of a rope and karabiner system\nMay 2006\n\nThe mass m of the solid cylinder is given by\nm\nl r\n!\n\"\n=\nwith r the radius of the\ngate, and ρ its density. r=6mm±0.5mm and for the gate we took ρ =ρA l= 2,700\nkg/m3. We thus get m=12.2±2.5 g\nl\nL\nFigure 2: top view of karabiner gate\nEventually, JO=6.51±1.72 10-6 kg.m2 and using the formula\nO\nC\nJ\n! =\nwe calculate ω =\n49.5±10 Hz.\n3.2 Natural frequency of a rope\nPlucked string analogy\nThe natural frequency ω of a thin plucked string can be found from :\nwhere l is the length of the rope, T is the tension and λ is the mass per unit length. For a\ntypical climber of 80 kg falling 3 m (i.e. from 1.5 m above the last point of protection) on\na 60 m rope weighing 10 kg, this suggests a natural frequency of 72 rad⋅s-1. By reducing\nthe distance fallen, the natural frequency can be increased : therefore for a fall of distance\n0.7 m the natural frequency is around 311 rad⋅s-1.\nClimbing rope as a Hookean spring\nA climber - climbing rope system could also be modeled as a mass on the end of a\nHookean spring. Here the natural frequency ω is given by :\nwhere k is the elastic stiffness of the rope and (mclimber + mrope) is the total mass of the\nsystem. A standard 60 m sports climbing rope which specified a 7% extension for the\nfirst fall of force 0.8 kN was used to estimate the spring constant, giving k = 187 N⋅m-1.\nFor an 80 kg climber, this gives us a natural frequency ω ~ 1.5 rad⋅s-1. It can be\nimmediately seen that this gives a natural frequency which is an order of magnitude less\nthan when the rope is plucked.\n\nAnalytical model of a rope and karabiner system\nMay 2006\n4. Discussion of results\nThe key results are summarized in Table 1. As can be seen the natural frequency of a\nrope can coincide with that of the karabiner although it is unlikely that such a small fall\nwould dissipate enough energy to cause a karabiner to fail, even if the gate were open.\nHowever, the calculation presented in the previous section are only approximate and\nmaybe for a larger fall the gate and rope frequencies are sufficiently close for the two to\ninteract, opening the karabiner and making it fail.\nIt is clear from our results that the frequencies likely to open a karabiner gate are caused\nby a plucking motion rather than the Hookean spring mode of oscillation.\nTable 1. Key results\nNatural frequency of karabiner gate\n311 rad⋅s -1\nNatural frequency of rope (plucked string, 0.7m)\n311 rad⋅s -1\nNatural frequency of rope (Hookean spring)\n1.5 rad⋅s -1\nFrom the calculations of the gate frequency it can be seen that the natural frequency of a\nwire gate karabiner is significantly higher due to the lower mass. From this point of view\na wire gate is less likely to open due to rope oscillations in falls with significant loading.\n5. Conclusions\nThat a karabiner gate can be opened and then the karabiner fail due to the oscillatory\nmotion of a climbing rope during a fall is not conclusively shown in this study. However,\nwhat is seen is that the natural frequency of the rope and karabiner gate can become close\nin certain fall geometries. Perhaps this is sufficient to leave reasonable doubt and warrant\nfurther research in this area in order to reach a better understanding of karabiner - rope\ninteractions. Meanwhile, it is suggested that climbers use wire gate karabiners!\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\nES.255 Physics of Rock Climbing\nSpring 2006\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."
