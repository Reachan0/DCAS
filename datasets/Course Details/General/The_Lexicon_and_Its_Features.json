  "course_description": "This course provides an overview of the distinctive features which distinguish sound categories of languages of the world. Theories which relate these categories to their acoustic and articulatory correlates, both universally and in particular languages, are covered. Models of word recognition by listeners, features, and phonological structure are also discussed. In addition, the course offers a variety of perspectives on these issues, drawn from Electrical Engineering, Linguistics and Cognitive Science.",

Kirchner 1997).\n- I.e. representations can encode unattested contrasts, but\nthey are excluded by constraints.\n- Dispersion Theory of Contrast (Flemming 2004, 2006):\n- Select an inventory of contrasts that best satisfies a\nranked set of constraints:\n- Maximize the distinctiveness of contrasts (MinDist)\n- Maximize the number of contrasts.\n- Minimize Effort.\n\nDispersion Theory of Contrast - OT implementation\n- Integration of differences on multiple dimensions is not well understood\n- here assume distance = largest distance on any dimension.\nF2\ni\ni\ny\n\nu\n\ne\nø\n\no\ne\nø\n\no\n4 F\n\næ\n\na\na\nMINDIST\n= 2\nMINDIST\n= 3\nMAXIMIZE\nCONTRASTS\nMINDIST\n= 4\nMINDIST\n= 5\na.\ni\na\nu\n3!\nb.\ni\ne\na\nu\no\n***\n*****\nc.\ni\ne\n\na\nu\no\n\n*!*****\n******** ********\n*******\nd.\ni\ne\na\nu\no\na\n*!\n*\n******\n********\ne.\ni\ne\n\na\nu\no\n*!\n*******\n********\n*\nf.\ni\ne\na\n\no\n***\n******!*\n\nConstraint-based theories of contrast\n- Preference for maximally distinct contrasts.\n- Some distinctiveness constraints are undominated.\n- E.g. even if phonological representations distinguish\n25% and 50% nasalized vowels, this may never be the\nsole basis for a contrast because it violates an inviolable\nMinimum Distance constraint.\n\nProblems with the representational theory of contrast\n- All theories allow for the representation of universally non-\ncontrastive properties, e.g. syllable structure, prosodic\nstructure (Steriade 1993).\n- Real criterion: representational elements are justified by\nevidence that they play a role in the formulation of\nphonological rules/constraints.\n- Non-contrastive features are necessary for the formulation\nof phonological generalizations. E.g. ejectives [t'] vs.\n(pre-)glottalized stops [ʔt].\n- Lombardi (1995) represents both as [+constricted\nglottis] because they never contrast minimally.\n\nProblems with the representational theory of contrast\nEjectives [t'] vs. (pre-)glottalized stops [ʔt].\n- Lombardi (1995) represents both as [+constricted glottis]\nbecause they never contrast minimally.\n- But these sounds pattern very differently:\n- Ejectives commonly neutralize with plain stops in\n'coda', e.g. Klamath, Shapsug, Peruvian Aymara,\nMaidu (Steriade 1997).\ntʼa ta\nat *atʼ\n- Glottalized stops are commonly restricted to coda, e.g.\nEnglish, Cantonese, Thai.\nta *ʔta\naʔt *at\n- These generalizations cannot be formulated if the two types\nof sounds are not distinguished.\n\nLimitations of the representational theory of contrast\n- The representational theory does not account for\ncombinatorial restrictions on feature contrasts.\n- [nasal] can be contrastive on vowels and stops, but not\non glottal stops or ejectives.\n- Front, central and back vowels can contrast [y ʉ u], but\nthese differences are not contrastive as secondary\narticulations on consonants.\n- These restrictions plausibly follow from minimum\ndistinctiveness requirements.\n\nPossible vs. Preferred Contrasts\n- The representational theory of contrast only seeks to\ndistinguish possible contrasts from impossible contrasts.\n- There are many generalizations about relative preferences\nfor contrasts, e.g. [i] vs. [u] is less marked than [y] vs. [u].\n- A theory of preferred contrasts can also account for\nrestrictions on possible contrasts.\n\nBackness and rounding in vowels\n- Non-low vowels are generally front and unrounded or back\nand rounded (86% of the vowels in the UPSID database of\nphonological inventories).\ni\nu\ne\no\na\n- Every language has a front unrounded vowel.\n- Every language has a back rounded vowel.\n- One reported exception: Jaqaru (Hardman 1966). Listen at:\nhttp://www.quechua.org.uk/Eng/Sounds/Home/HomeWords.htm\nand decide for yourself.\n- Not every language has front rounded (y, ø, etc), central (ɨ,\nə etc) or back unrounded (ɯ, ɤ etc) vowels.\n\nBackness and rounding in vowels\n- Explanation based on preference for maximizing distinctiveness of\ncontrasts:\n- Covarying backness and rounding in this way maximizes the F2\ndifference between front and back vowels (Liljencrants & Lindblom\n1972, Stevens, Keyser & Kawasaki 1986).\nF2\ni\ny\nɨ\nɯ\nu\n- MinDist = F2:6 >> Max Contrasts >> Mindist = F2:5\n- No non-peripheral vowels\n- More distinct contrasts are preferred, some differences are insufficiently\ndistinct to provide an adequate contrast.\n- Representational theory has nothing to say about preferences\ndistinctiveness constraints also necessary.\n\nContrasts on multiple dimensions\n- Consonantal contrasts are typically based on differences on\nmultiple dimensions.\n- Stop place: quality of burst spectrum, F2 & F3 transitions\n(closure and release).\n- Stop voicing: VOT, preceding vowel duration, f0 in\npreceding and following vowels, burst intensity, etc.\n- A contrast may be adequately distinct as a result of the\ncombined contributions of multiple cues.\n- e.g. pre-pausal fricative voicing contrasts in English.\n- A contrast may be neutralized because it is not possible to\nrealize sufficient cues in the context (Steriade 1997 etc).\n- e.g. Lithuanian stop voicing contrasts are neutralized\nwhere VOT cannot be realized.\n\nNatural Classes\n- McCarthy (1994) asserts that an adequate theory of\nphonological features 'must be able to characterize all and\nonly the natural classes of sounds that recur in the\nphonological phenomena of different languages'\n- Not clear how this is supposed to work. Perhaps every\nconjunction of feature values must specify a natural class.\n- If so, increasing the number of features risks predicting too\nmany natural classes.\n- Are [F2 12] or [F2 9, +coronal] natural classes?\n- Not clear that standard small feature sets come anywhere\nnear to meeting this criterion.\n- Does any constraint need to refer to [+high tone, +round]?\n\nNatural Classes\n- An alternative approach to possible natural classes:\n- Possible natural classes are those that are mentioned in\nthe universal set of constraints.\n- There is no reason why any particular combination of\nfeatures has to be mentioned in a constraint - depends on\nthe theory of constraints.\n- There are distinct constraint families that regulate different\naspects of phonological form:\n- Perceptual distinctiveness (MinDist)\n- Articulatory effort\n- Correspondence\n\nNatural Classes\n- Each constraint family refers to different aspects of phonological\nrepresentation in particular ways:\n- Distinctiveness constraints refer to perceptual distance only - not to\narticulatory features, and not to particular values of perceptual\nfeatures.\n- Effort constraints refer to (certain aspects) of articulatory\nrepresentations.\n- Correspondence constraints may also refer to perceptual distance (cf.\nSteriade 2001).\n- I.e. strong restrictions on reference to features.\n- Examining the set of features independently of the constraint families\nwith which they are associated is uninformative.\n\nSummary\n- The fundamental criterion for proposing that a feature (or\nrepresentational distinction) is part of phonological\nrepresentation is evidence that a constraint is sensitive to\nthat difference.\n- The evidence suggests that constraints can be sensitive to\nphonetic differences that never serve as the sole basis for a\ncontrast.\n- E.g. correspondence to burst strength.\n- Limitations on possible contrasts derive from constraints on\nwhat constitutes a good constrast - particularly\ndistinctiveness constraints.\n\nEnd"

Usually the glottis forms a narrow\nopening so that the acoustic coupling between the subglottal and supraglottal system is small.\nHowever, the air from the lungs passes through the trachea and the glottis and there is a pressure\ndrop across the glottis. Thus the glottis plays an important role in regulating airflow. The\nvelopharyngeal port usually remains closed at all times except in the vicinity of a nasal\nconsonant (in English).\nSource: Stevens, K. N. Acoustic Phonetics.

The dashed lines indicate that the vocal-tract walls can\nyield or move in response to changes in the intraoral pressure Pm. The subglottal pressure in ps\nand the opening to the nasal cavity is an.

N. 6.543J Lecture 1 02/08/07\n\nThis figure schematizes the respiratory system. When we take a breath in preparation for\nspeaking, we expand the lungs by contracting intercostal muscles and by lowering the\ndiaphragm. Following the inspiration the lung volume decreases in part due to passive return to\na smaller volume, but with continued adjustment of the muscles of inspiration and inspiration.\nThe net result is that the tracheal pressure remains roughly constant through much of the\nexpiration, except for creating special prominences or inserting pauses. A typical subglottal\npressure during normal speaking is in the range 6-8 cm H2O.\n\nSource: Stevens, K. N. Acoustic Phonetics. MIT Press, 1998.\nCourtesy of MIT Press.

N. 6.543J Lecture 1 02/08/07\nA very simple schematization of the respiratory system during speech production, together with\nsome rough values of components is shown below.\n\nDuring phonation, the action of the subglottal pressure on the vocal folds can set these structures\ninto vibration. A section through the larynx (Figure 1.4) shows the vocal folds. The subglottal\npressure below the vocal folds (in the trachea) will cause them to vibrate. Pulses of air pass\nbetween the folds.\nSource: Stevens, K. N. Acoustic Phonetics. MIT Press, 1998.\nCourtesy of MIT Press. Used with permission.\n\nStevens, K. N. 6.543J Lecture 1 02/08/07\n\nA typical waveform of the volume velocity through the glottis (the space between the vocal\nfolds) is shown below in Figure 1.27. In this example, the airflow is zero for about one-half of a\ncycle and the airflow has a peak value of about 600 cm3/s. The average value is about 150 cm3/s.\n\nDuring a typical respiratory cycle in speech, the lung volume might fluctuate by about 1000 cm3\n(1 liter). Thus during phonation like that in Figure 1.27, a steady phonation could be maintained\nfor about 7 seconds. During this kind of phonation for a vowel, there is just one narrow\nconstriction in the airway --- the constriction at the glottis (although during phonation it is a\ntime-varying phonation). Phonation of this kind, with just one major constriction, also occurs for\nsome consonants, like nasal consonants, liquids (/l/ and /r/), and glides (/w/ and /j/). These are\ncalled sonorant consonants.\n\nThe flows, pressures, and the sound become more complicated when there is a constriction in the\nvocal tract above the glottis as well as a constriction at the glottis. This situation was represented\nSource: Stevens, K. N. Acoustic Phonetics. MIT Press, 1998.\nCourtesy of MIT Press. Used with permission.\nSource: Stevens, K. N. Acoustic Phonetics.

In\nFigure 1.36, the additional constriction is at the lips.\n\nFigure 1.36 shows the subglottal pressure Ps, the glottal constriction Zg, the supraglottal\nconstriction Zc, and some other circuit elements representing the yielding walls of the vocal tract\n(Rw, Mw, Cw), the acoustic compliance Cv of the air between the two constrictions, and a\n\"source\" Ua that represents active expansion of the volume between the constrictions (or\ncontraction if Ua is negative). All of these components can play a role in producing consonants\nthat involve a pressure increase (or decrease?) in the oral cavity. These are the so-called\nobstruent consonants. For these consonants, the vocal folds no longer vibrate freely wit no\nsupraglottal pressure, but either vibrate less strongly or not at all. Also for these consonants,\nthere is a pressure drop across the supraglottal constriction, equal to the interaural pressure Pm.\nAs a consequence there is a rapid flow of air through this constriction, and turbulence in this\nflow can generate a source of sound. This generation of noise (or sometimes a transient sound)\nis a kind of defining acoustic attribute of an obstruent consonant. Also when producing an\nobstruent consonant, a speaker senses the buildup of pressure in the mouth, and hence such a\nconsonant has a somatosensory component.\n\n[Sonorant]\n\nWith regard to the distinctive feature [sonorant], then, we have the following defining attributes:\nFor the feature value [+sonorant]:\n(a) The glottal source can be generated with full amplitude without forming a downstream\npressure increase.\nSource: Stevens, K. N. Acoustic Phonetics. MIT Press, 1998.\nCourtesy of MIT Press. Used with permission.\n\nStevens, K. N. 6.543J Lecture 1 02/08/07\n(b) There is no noise generated by turbulent airflow at a supraglottal constriction.\n(c) There is no excitation of somatosensory receptors due to a pressure increase.\nFor the feature value [-sonorant]:\n(a) The glottal source is attenuated or obliterated due to a reduced transglottal pressure.\n(b) Noise is generated due to turbulent airflow in the vicinity of a supraglottal constriction.\n(c) Pressure is built up in the oral cavity behind the constriction; this pressure buildup\nproduces a distinctive somatosensory response in the speaker's oral cavity.\n\nSound sources for speech\n\nThe defining attributes for the distinctive feature [sonorant] are concerned with sound sources\nthat are produced in speech --- a noise source due to turbulence in the airflow near a constriction\nin the vocal tract, and a periodic source arising from vocal-fold vibration. We'll discuss these\nsources briefly before we move on to other features.\n\nA general model of speech sound production is given below.\n\nGlottal source:\n\nSource: Fig. 1.27 and Fig. 3.1 in Stevens, K. N. Acoustic Phonetics. MIT Press, 1998.\nCourtesy of MIT Press. Used with permission.\n\nStevens, K. N. 6.543J Lecture 1 02/08/07\n\nTurbulence noise source:\n\nSource: Fig. 3.1 in Stevens, K. N. Acoustic Phonetics. MIT Press, 1998.\nCourtesy of MIT Press. Used with permission.\n\nThe filtering of these sources modifies the spectrum by introducing peaks in particular frequency\nranges. One way of looking at it is that the sources excite the resonances or \"natural frequencies\"\nof the vocal tract. In the case of a noise source near a constriction, it will tend to excite the\nresonances of the part of the vocal tract anterior to the constriction. Usually, much of the noise is\nproduced by a jet of air from the constriction impinging on an obstacle, such as the lower teeth.\n\nThere are a few things about the glottal source and the noise source that are relevant to the\ndiscussion of distinctive features.\n\nThe glottal source is produced by setting the vocal folds into vibration by applying a subglottal\npressure. The vocal folds will only vibrate when certain conditions are met. If they are too far\napart, they will not vibrate. If they are pushed too tightly together, the subglottal pressure will\nnot be enough to start them vibrating. For an intermediate spacing, a glottal source with\nmaximum amplitude will be generated. Also the stiffness of the vocal folds affects their ability\nto vibrate. When they are stiff, a greater transglottal pressure is needed to set them into\nvibration. When they are more slack, they will vibrate with a lower transglottal pressure. And\nthere is a minimum transglottal pressure below which vibration cannot occur. When there is\nSource: Stevens, K. N. Acoustic Phonetics. MIT Press, 1998.\nCourtesy of MIT Press. Used with permission.\n\nStevens, K. N. 6.543J Lecture 1 02/08/07\nvibration, the amplitude of the volume-velocity source is roughly proportional to the transglottal\npressure to the power 3/2.\n\nThe amplitude of the turbulence noise source in the vicinity of a narrow constriction is roughly\nproportional to\n.A\nP\nΔ\n, where P\nΔ\nis the pressure drop across the constriction and A is the cross-\nsectional area of the constriction. Turbulence noise can also be generated at the glottal\nconstriction, and is called aspiration noise.\n\n[Continuant] and [Strident]\n\nA [-sonorant] or obstruent consonant is produced by creating a narrow constriction in the airway,\nusually in the oral cavity, and by building up pressure behind this constriction. The constriction\ncan form a complete closure to generate a stop consonant, or can form a narrow opening to\nproduce a fricative consonant. The contrast between these two types of obstruent consonants is\ncaptured by the distinctive feature. [continuant]: + for fricatives, - for stops. In the case of a\n[+continuant] segment, there is continuous generation of noise during the constricted interval.\nFor a [-continuant] segment, no sound is generated during the closure interval, and then a short\nburst of noise is produced at the time the closure is released. The pressure behind the\nconstriction for these obstruent consonants creates forces on the surface of the articulator that is\nforming the constriction, and these forces influence the positioning of the articulator both during\nthe fricative and in the time interval following the release.\n\nWithin the class of [+continuant] consonants, there are some consonants, produced by forming a\nconstriction with the tongue blade, for which the amplitude of the noise spectrum at high\nfrequencies (in the range of the third formant or higher) is greater than the amplitude of the\nspectrum in the adjacent vowel in the same frequency range. These consonants have been\nclassified as [+strident]. For other fricative consonants the spectrum amplitude of the noise in\nthis frequency range is much less.\n\nThe special characteristic of the production of [+strident] consonants can be illustrated with the\nmodels in Figure B.\n\na\n\nb\n\nSchematic representations of the\nfront cavity in a sound like /s/\n(part a), and like // (part b).\nFigure B\n\nThe model in Part a is intended to represent a sound like /s/ where there is constriction and an\nopening into a front cavity. The model in part b shows a shorter front cavity and a source closer\nto the constriction, as might exist in the fricative //. Estimates of the sound pressure of the\nradiated sound show that the amplitude is much greater in a than in b. The difference is about 15\ndB, assuming the same source amplitudes in the two cases. In a the source is located at a place\nwhere it is more effective in exciting the front cavity resonance. Thus it appears that the\n\nStevens, K. N. 6.543J Lecture 1 02/08/07\n[+strident] consonant achieves its high amplitude at high frequencies because of the relative\nposition of the source.\n\n[Stiff vocal folds]\n\nWe turn next to the voicing distinction for obstruents. All obstruent consonants in English can\nbe either voiced or voiceless. One defining attribute of obstruent consonants is that they are\nproduced with a raised intraoral pressure. This means that the transglottal pressure (the pressure\ndrop across the glottis) is reduced relative to the subglottal pressure.\n\nThe various conditions are schematized in Figure C, where the phonation amplitude is plotted\nagainst vocal-fold stiffness for several values of intraoral pressure (assuming a fixed subglottal\npressure of 8 cm H2O). For an intraoral pressure of more than 6 cm H2O, the transglottal\npressure is 2 cm H2O, and is below the threshold of phonation, and hence there will be no\nphonation. For smaller values of intraoral pressure (say 4 cm in the figure), phonation will occur\nover a range in which the vocal folds are slack, but for greater stiffness phonation will not occur.\nThere is a value of stiffness where there is an abrupt change from phonation to no phonation.\nThe name [stiff vocal folds] has been used to identify this feature: for [+stiff vocal folds] glottal\nvibration is inhibited, and for [-stiff vocal folds] glottal vibration is facilitated within the\nconsonant region. Other articulator actions can also be implemented to inhibit vibration, such as\nspreading of the glottis. These matters relating to enhancing gestures for features will be\ndiscussed later.\nThe voicing feature [stiff vocal folds]\nFor a given intraoral pressure, increase in vocal-fold\nstiffness causes an abrupt termination of glottal\nvibration a particular threshold of transglottal pressure.\nSubglottal pressure assumed to be 8 cm H2O\nFigure C"

Cambridge Handbook)\n\nDeletion, insertion in rule-based\nunderspecification\n- Underspecified segments more likely to be\ndeleted because they have fewer or no\nfeatures.\n- More likely to be inserted because you only\ninsert their X slots, not the features: the\nlatter come from the application of context-\nfree redundancy rules.\n\nUnderspecification and faithfulness\n- In a grammar with a faithfulness component, a value\nthat is identified as [0F] is more deletable than [αF]:\nno MAX F violation\n- But any feature inserted will cause a DEP F violation,\nso to distinguish between features more or less likely\nto be inserted we need rankings of DEP F, not\nunderspecification.\n\nN-ary scales and underspecification\n- Binary differences can be characterized, with\nunderspecification, as [αF]-[0F]:\n- Catalan coda t, d assimilates to p, b and k, g:\n- p and k do not assimilate to each other or to t, d.\n- so [0Place] assimilates to [αPlace]\n- But for n-ary scales (n >3) of assimilation, deletability\nor epenthesis, underspecification explains only a\nfragment of the data to be analyzed.\n\nUnmarked = underspecified\n- 3+-step hierarchies in assimilation, deletion and insertion\n- Korean Place Assimilation (Jun 1995, 2004): K > P > T\n- tp, tk -> pp, kk\npt, kt intact.\n- pk -> kk ~ pk\nkp intact\n- Coalescence/F-Sensitive Elision in hiatus (Casali 1997): a > e > i\n- Japanese epenthesis(Ito&Mester 1995): o/t, d_; i/tS, k_; /other\nC_ > other V\n- coronal = [0 place]: explains 1/2 of Korean pattern of assimilation.\n-\n= [0 high, 0back]: does nor explain i, o vs. other preference\n- Other hierarchies of deletion and assimilation cannot be recoded as\n[αF]-[0F]: root vs. affix segment, initial vs. non-initial.\n\nUnmarked = underspecified\n- The hierarchies are analyzable with MAX/DEP rankings:\n- MAX F/root >> MAX F/affix\n- MAX Dorsal >> MAX Labial >> MAX Coronal\n- MAX/DEP [+Low] >> MAX/DEP [-High] >> MAX/DEP [+High]\n- Perhaps all the necessary MAX/DEP rankings can be predicted from\neffects of input-output similarity.\n- Preference for [o] over [ ] in epenthesis after t, d_ in Japanese is\nindirectly aimed at preventing DEP [strident] IO violations.\n- Then the uses of underspecification are subsumed by mechanisms\nneeded independently.\n- Maybe not all that is clear as yet. What is clear is that under-\nspecification accounts for just a fragment of the patterns it was\ndesigned to explain."

But which?\n- Dimensions that contrast for just some features:\n- timing of oral constriction to [nasal]:\n{mb, m, b}\n- timing of oral constriction to aspiration: *{hp, (h)ph, p}\n- timing of closure to frication phase: *{pf, fp, p, f}\nIntrasegmental timing is not a phonological property.\nThen how do we characterize {mb, m, b}?\n3/23/07\n\nExplaining sound patterns with an\nimpoverished feature set\n- Release controls the realization of contrasts (McCawley 1967)\n- Th vs. T, Ts vs. T, ɾ vs. t, ɾ vs. l contrasts in Korean are\nneutralized where stops are unreleased. In the right grammar,\nunrelease triggers neutralization rules, but this requires [±release]\nto be mentioned in phonology.\n- Prenasal C's are nasal only on their left side (Anderson 1976)\n- nasality can only spread left from [mb]\n- nasality can spread left and right from [m]\n- Affricates are fricatives only on their right (Steriade 1992)\n- English, Romanian disallow [sʃ, ss, sz, ʃz]\n- but allow [stʃ, ʃtʃ]\n3/23/07\n\n3/23/07\nMcCawley 1967:528\n\nHow many distinctive features?\n- Standard answer: there must be very few, because there are few\nphones types (McCawley: cca 2K) and many fewer phoneme types.\n- McCawley (1967:526):\n- SPE's features yield, when freely combined, 29, 434, 432\nphones.\n- The difference between 29, 434, 432 and 2K is made up by\nconstraints on combinations of feature values.\n- Then it doesn't matter that the actual number of features is, say, 20\nand not 200. Rather what matters are the constraints on feature\ncombinations.\n- To understand what the phonological features are we need to look\nnot at inventories but at properties referenced in phonological rules-\nconstraints. These are frequently non-contrastive properties.\n3/23/07\n\nThe phonological relevance of\nnon-contrastive properties\n- Some never-contrastive properties of speech sounds:\n- release, burst (Albright 2006)\n- timing of oral constriction to other F's (Steriade 1997)\n- small duration/closure degree differences (Fougeron and Steriade 1997)\n- We can show two things:\n- Non-contrastive properties are cyclically transmitted from base to\nderivative, just like features. This has effects on morphology.\n- The distribution of contrasts depends on the distribution of non-\ncontrastive properties: phonology can't characterize the former\nwithout referring to the latter as well.\n3/23/07\n\nThe cycle: review\n- [saɪkl ] vs. [saɪkl ɪŋ], [saɪklɪŋ]\n\n- Syllabic C's are generally disallowed: *C[+syll]\n- Except to avoid impossible syllables:\nSonority Sequencing >> *C[+syll],\n[saɪkl ] > [saɪkl]; Kar[l] > Kar[l]\n\n- V-initial suffixes should allow optimal syllabification:\n[saɪklɪŋ] > [saɪkl ɪŋ]\n\n- Βut for the preference for Base-Derivative similarity:\n{[saɪkl ]-[saɪkl ɪŋ]} > {[saɪkl ][saɪklɪŋ]}\n\n- Ident [syllabic] BD >> *C[+syll],\n- The right analysis of cyclic effects involves explicit and\n3/23/07\ndetailed identity conditions of this sort.\n\nHow this bears on distinctive features\n- Bases and derivatives prefer to be identical.\n- What counts as identical?\na. If phonology never accesses some phonetic properties\n(release, timing, duration), then identity for those could\nnever be enforced,\nb. unless the phonetic implementation component does\nthe same job of enforcing Base-Derivative identity, only\nfor non-contrastive features.\n- We now look at cases that disconfirm (a) - showing that\nphonology does access never-contrastive properties - or\nforce us to accept the task duplication inherent in (b).\n3/23/07\n\nPhonetic cyclicity:\nAlbright 2006 on transmission of\nunrelease in -ee derivatives\nIf you have the contrasts below, the paper is\nabout you:\n3/23/07\n\nOutline of argument\n- Faithfulness to quality of final releases determines\n- how the -ee derivative is realized\n- whether any -ee derivative is ok from a given form\n- What kind of thing is the \"quality of final releases\"?\n- [released], a never-contrastive feature.\n- not only [±spread glottis], not the syllable position of the stop\nconflict: DEP [released] BD vs.*unreleased/_'V\nconflict causes paradigm gaps (*eat-ee): no way to satisfy both.\n3/23/07\n\nWhy just -ee?\n- Poverty of stimulus situation (very few or\nno lexicalized stop-final -ee items)\n- Allows speaker preferences to emerge\nwithout interference. Better attested affixes\n(-eer, etc) have established patterns, which\nspeakers must follow.\n3/23/07\n\nIdentity between degree of aspiration\nof final C in Base and Derivative\nThis is not failure

A C that does not contrast for aspiration can be realized\n(or recorded) as either C or as Ch\n- Reasons:\n(a) VOT increases as the oral constriction goes towards the\nback.

More on this later.\n- Preference for maximal use of MOD:\nA priori, one wouldn't expect just 21% of the languages that have a\nC/Ch contrast to restrict C's with naturally long VOT's from using it. If\none constraint favors the contrast and one goes against it in some class\nof C's, one would expect an even distribution of aspiration-restricted\nand unrestricted languages. So there is maybe an additional factor that\nfavors the across-the-board use of MOD contrasts: cf. Clements 2005.\n3/19/07\n\nTransition to Mielke\n- There are lawful gaps in the classes of C's that express a\nspecific MOD.\n- This suggests that the surface inventory of C's arises from\nthe interaction of constraints promoting use of MOD\n(Flemming's 1995 MAX Contrast) and specific constraints prohibiting\na MOD contrast in some subclass (Flemming's 1995 MIN Dist).\n- The key point now: the surface inventory does not\nprovide an unobstructed view into the grammar: one has\nto unravel the interactions to recover the natural classes.\n- Next: what conclusions about natural classes and features\nfollow when this point is not heeded.\n3/19/07\n\nE.

Introduction\n\nQuestions raised by the process of iterative rounding spread in Tlingit [Lingit] :\n\n- What does it mean for a feature to be contrastive in a given environment?\n- What does it mean for two segments to contrast with respect to a given feature?\n\nWhat's the problem?\n\n- Consonantal segments behave differently from non-consonantals with respect to\nLingit's process of iterative rounding spread. There is a \"very natural intuition\"\nthat the difference is due to a subtle difference in how consonantals and non-\nconsonantals are organized into contrasting pairs.\n\n- More specifically, I seek a principled explanation of why consonantal and non-\nconsonantal segments behave differently with respect to Lingit's process of\niterative rounding spread. Interestingly, it's very difficult to state such an account\nwithin the language of serious, contemporary phonological theories of features\nand featural composition of segments. This is despite the fact that the rule is a\nsimple one to state intuitively, and is a very easy part of the Lingit accent to pick\nup on and mimic.\n\n2.

The Rule of Iterative Rounding Spread\n\nA. Stated as a Simple, Intuitive Rule:\n\nIf a rounded segment precedes a segment S with a rounded \"counterpart\", then S is\nreplaced with its rounded counterpart. (iterate until it can no longer apply)\n\nB. Stated as a Surface Generalization:\n\nNo sequences S1S2 where S1 is rounded and S2 is unrounded, and either\n(i)\nS2 can bear rounding,\n(ii)\nS2 is a high vowel,\n(iii)\nS2 is a palatal glide.\n\nIf (i) occurs in the input, then spread the rounding feature to S2. If (ii) occurs in the\ninput, then S2 is made back and supplied with rounding. If (iii) occurs in the input, then\nS2 is replaced with the labio-velar glide.\n\nC. Stated as a Structure Preserving Process:\n\nRounding spreads as far to the right as possible. However, this spreading process will\nnot make segments which do not independently exist in the Lingit inventory. How\nconsonantals and non-consonantals satisfy the structure-preservingness of the process\ndiffer. A consonantal (obstruent) which cannot bear rounding will not undergo the\nprocess, and will halt any further rightward spread of rounding. A vowel or glide,\nhowever, will change their value of backness in order to facilitate the rightward spread\nof rounding. No segment changes its height value in order to facilitate rightward\nrounding spread.\n\n4. The Rule of Iterative Rounding Spread in Action\n\n4.1. Suffixal Allomorphy\n\nMany nominal and verbal suffixes have the form V(C), where after rounded segments the\nV is realized as \"oo\" and after all other segments the V is realized as \"ee\".\n\n(1)\na. Haat ga-gud-een.\nhere imperf-walk-contingent\nWhenever he comes here...\n\nb. Haat gut ga-noogw-oon.\nhere walk imperf-AUX-contingent\nWhenever he comes here...\n\n(Story 1966; p. 106)\n\nThe most natural interpretation is that the V is underlyingly \"ee\" and undergoes rounding\nspread. Furthermore, there is no suffix surfacing as \"ee(C)\" which does not become\n\"oo(C)\" when following a rounded segment.\n\nSome suffixes are simple Cs which can bear rounding ( \"-k\" iterative ; \"-k'\" diminutive ).\nFollowing rounded segments, they also become rounded.\n\n(2) Ax yaakw - k' - ee\nI\nAx yaakw-k'w-oo.\nmy boat - dim - poss\nMy little boat (Story 1966; p. 18)\n\nThis example also illustrates the continued spread of rounding onto the following\npossessive suffix.\n\nSuffixes of the form Cee where C is a segment without a rounded counterpart are such\nthat their vowel \"ee\" is never a target of rounding spread. The 'conditional suffix' is\nalways of the form \"nee\", even after rounded segments.\n\n(3) A kaa-x at-xaa nukw-nee.\nits surface-from indef-eat AUX-conditional\nIf he eats from it...\n\n(Story 1966; p. 106)\n\nSimilarly, if a suffix of the form C, where C is a segment without a rounded counterpart,\noccurs after a rounded segment, then no suffix after it will undergo a change in rounding\ninduced by that rounded segment.\n\n(4) A-kaheix noo-j-een.\n\n3Ob-plant AUX-habitual-decessive\nHe always used to plant.\n\n(Story 1966; p. 103)\n\nExamples (1), (3) and (4) illustrate the fact that obstruents lacking a rounded\n\"counterpart\" will block the rightward spread of rounding.\n\n4.2 The Form of Epenthetic Segments\n\nVowels are epenthesized to break up illicit tri-consonantal sequences within certain\ndomains. If the preceding consonant is rounded, then the epenthetic vowel is \"oo\"; if the\npreceding consonant is unrounded, then the form of the epenthetic vowel is \"ee\".\n\n(5)\na. taakl - ch\n\nI\ntaakl-ee-ch\n\nhammer - instr\nwith a hammer\n\nb. ts'itskw tlein\nI\nts'itsg-oo tlein\n\nsongbird big\nbig songbird\n\n(Story 1966; p. 13)\n\nConsonants are inserted to break up hiatus sequences. If the preceding vowel is rounded,\nthen the epenthetic C is \"w\"; if the preceding V is unrounded, then the form of the\nepenthetic C is \"y\".\n\n(6)\na. du saa - ee\nÆ\ndu saa-y-ee\n\nhis name-poss\nhis name\n\n(Story 1966; p. 18)\n\nb. haa too - ee Æ\nhaa too-w-oo\nour inside-poss\nour spirit / our feeling\n\n(Naish 1966; p. 15)\n\n4.3 Generalizations Regarding the Base\n\nThere is a phonotactic constraint active in Lingit which bans from the base (lexicon) all\nsequences S1S2 where S1 is rounded and S2 is an unrounded segment with a rounded\n\"counterpart.\" In other words, there is strictly progressive rounding harmony 'in the\nbase'.\n\nSupporting Facts 1:\n\nThere are many roots - both nominal and verbal - that contain syllables whose\nonsets are rounded consonants: \"xwaal\" (shake); \"kwaan\" (people, nation). There\nare also many roots containing syllables whose nuclei are high unrounded vowels:\n\"seew\" (rain); \"neekw\" (to feel bad, to be sick). However, there is no nominal or\nverbal root in Lingit containing a syllable whose nucleus is high and unrounded,\n\n1 The following claims about the phonological form of Tlingit roots are supported by a careful examination\nof the following works: Story & Naish 1973 and Naish, Story, Davis & Leer 1996.\n\nand whose onset is rounded. Where C1 is any consonant, there are no roots\ncontaining the syllables C1\nwee(C) , C1\nwi(C) , wee(C) , or wi(C).2\n\nMany roots in Lingit have syllables whose nuclei are rounded: \"woon\" (maggot);\n\"goot\" (walk). There are also many roots containing syllables whose codas are\nunrounded consonants with rounded \"counterparts\": \"teey\" (patch); \"naak\" (to\nstand). Nevertheless, there is no nominal or verbal root containing a syllable\nwhose nucleus is rounded and whose coda is an unrounded consonant with a\nrounded \"counterpart.\" Where C1 is a roundable consonant, there are no roots\ncontaining the syllables (C)ooC1 , (C)uC1 , (C)ooy, (C)uy 3.\n\nNevertheless, it is possible for a root in Lingit to contain a syllable with a rounded\nnucleus and an onset which is a unrounded consonant with a rounded counterpart.\nThat is, where C1 is a roundable consonant, there are plenty of roots containing\nthe syllables C1oo(C) , C1u(C) , yoo(C), yu(C). Furthermore, Tlingit does not\ndisallow its roots from containing syllables with high, front nuclei and rounded\ncodas. Roots of the form (C)eew , (C)iw , (C)eeCw , (C)iCw are widely attested.\n\n5. Analyses\n\n5.1 A Purely Descriptive, Uninteresting Account\n\nComponent Hypotheses:\n\n1. Rounding Spreads Rightward\n\nAlign( [round] , R , Tail ) >> Dep(Link)\n\n2. Structure Preservation\n\n*[round, -back] >> Align( [round] , R , Tail )\n\n3. Rounding Spread Induces Place Change in Non-Consonantals\n\nIdentOBST(back) >> Align( [round] , R , Tail ) >> Ident(back)\n\n4. Rounding Spread Never Induces a Change in Height\n\nIdent(high) >> Align( [round] , R , Tail )\n\n2 There exists one possible counterexample. The word \"wink\" is a late borrowing for commercially\npurchased milk. We shall return to this form later on.\n3 A point of clarification is necessary here. There are many words in Lingit whose orthographic\nrepresentation would make them appear to be counterexamples to this claim. For example, the verbal root\nmeaning \"to soften\" is written as \"chook\". However, the Lingit orthography has the convention of not\nindicating rounding on obstruents which is the result of rounding spread. That is, Lingit orthography only\nindicates rounding on obstruents when it is contrastive. Ironically, it is the fact that there are no roots\nwritten as \"CooCw\" which indicates that rounding is not distinctive on obstruents in this environment.\n\nWhy this is a terrible story\n\n- Constraint \"Align( [round], R, Tail )\" is very suspect in this context. Kaun's\nperceptual theory can't be what's behind rounding spread in Lingit.\n- Difference in behavior of consonantals and non-consonantals is stipulated.\n- Structure preservation is stipulated by highly ranked inventory constraint.\n\n5.2 Contrast-Based Analyses\n\n5.2.1 Enhancement Motivates the Rounding Spread (Cable 2004)\n\nComponent Hypotheses:\n\n1. In order to accentuate the contrast between rounded and unrounded back\nobstruents, an enhancing gesture of 'distinctly wide lip spread' is employed. All\nthe unrounded obstruents which can bear rounding (unrounded back obstruents)\nare pronounced with a much wider lip spread than (a) their English correlates, (b)\nthe unrounded obstruents which cannot bear rounding (unrounded front\nobstruents).\n\n2. The palatal glide \"y\" is also produced with 'distinctly wide lip spread'. This\ngesture may either be a simple primitive of the phone, or it may be in place to\naccentuate the contrast between \"y\" and \"w\". (until very recently, \"y\" was an\nunrounded velar glide)\n\n3. The high front vowels \"ee\" and \"i\" are produced with 'distinctly wide lip spread'.\nThis gesture may either be a simple primitive of the phone, or it may be in place\nto accentuate the contrast between \"ee\" and \"oo\", and between \"i\" and \"u\".\n\n4. There exists a constraint \" *[round][spread] \" which bans sequences where\nrounded segments are directly followed by segments with wide lip spread. A\nphonetic grounding for this constraint may be found in the especially great\n'distance' between the gesture for rounding and the gesture for wide lip spread.\n\n5. The constraint \" *[round][spread] \" is undominated in Lingit.\n\nBenefits of this Story:\n\n- Much of the structure-preservingness of this process follows from the distribution\nof the enhancement 'smiling'. Front obstruents do not undergo the process of\nrounding spread because (i) they do not contrast with another segment in\nrounding, so (ii) they are not produced with enhancement 'smiling', so (iii) they\nmay follow rounded segments without incurring a violation of the constraint\n*[round][spread]. The same story holds for non-high vowels.\n\n- The difference between consonantals and non-consonantals follows from the\ndistribution of the enhancement 'smiling'. Front obstruents do not change their\nbackness in order to facilitate rounding spread because they simply aren't\nmotivated to undergo rounding spread. However, front vowels and glides do\nchange their backness in order to facilitate rounding spread, because of their being\npronounced with enhancement 'smiling'. In short, we may suppose that generally\n*[round][spread] outranks Ident(back). Front consonants never change their\nbackness value because there is never any motivation to do so.\n\n- We needn't appeal to an alignment constraint for rounding. Rounding spreads\nsimply to eliminate abrupt changes in lip posture (why it spreads rightward and\nnot leftward is unexplained).\n\nProblems with this Story:\n\n- There is reason to doubt that the hypothesized enhancement gesture exists.\n\nIt's never been reported before.\nIan Maddieson doesn't remember seeing (or measuring) such a thing when\nhe and his team studied the phonetics of Lingit.\nTheir \"k\"s sure don't sound 'smiley'.\n\n- How does one test whether it does exist without access to an informant (at the\nmoment)?\n\nThere are videotapes of spoken Lingit at the ANLC, but they are poorly\norganized. One would have to call Jeff Leer (preeminent Lingit and Na-\nDene scholar) and ask him for a favor.\nI have several hours of spoken Lingit on CD (part of a beginners level\nLingit textbook). Perhaps one could acoustically measure whether the\nunrounded \"k\"s are 'smiley'? What could the acoustic signature of\n'smileyness' be? What are the comparisons that are to be made?\n\n5.2.2 Rounding Spread Occurs Because Min-Dist Will Not Allow Labial\nCoarticulation of \"k\" to Co-Exist with \"kw\"\n\nComponent Hypotheses:\n\n1. In Lingit there is much preservatory coarticulation of rounding, but not nearly so\nmuch anticipatory coarticulation of rounding. The constraints enforcing\npreservatory coarticulation of rounding are undominated in the language.\n\n2. Let us represent rounded S as \"Sw\", and let us represent a S subject to rounding\ncoarticulation as \"Sw\". There is active in Lingit a Min-Dist constraint preventing\n\nthese three segment-types from contrasting. The Min-Dist constraint preventing\nthe contrast of S, Sw and Sw outranks Ident(round).\n\n3. The consequence is that when a S that contrasts in rounding with Sw follows a\nrounded segment, the only way to satisfy the needs of the preservatory\ncoarticulation constraint and the Min-Dist constraint is to change the value of S's\nrounding.\n\nBenefits of this Story:\n\n- Much of the structure-preservingness of this process follows from the set of\ncontrasting segments in the language. Since \"tw\" is absent from Lingit, the Min-\nDist constraints do not ban the surfacing of \"tw\". Thus, there is no motivation for\n\"t\" to undergo rounding spread.\n\n- Again, the difference between consonantals and non-consonantals follows from\nthe inventory of Lingit. Front obstruents do not change their backness value to\nfacilitate rounding spread because they do not contrast with another segment in\nrounding.\n\n- We needn't appeal to an alignment constraint for rounding. Rounding spreads\nbecause Lingit speakers will not tolerate so fine a distinction as that between\n\"kw\" and \"kw\".\n\nProblems with this Story:\n\n- We don't immediately have a handle on why rounding spread transforms \"iw\" into\n\"u\". Perhaps \"iw\" in Lingit ends up sounding very much like \"u\" and some\nindependent Min-Dist constraint governing the inventory of Vs stamps it out? (In\na somewhat different form, this difficulty also holds for the analysis in 5.2.1)\n\n- Long high vowels such as \"ee\" undergo rounding spread to transform into \"oo\".\nIs this really because a Min-Dist constraint won't permit the contrast between\n\"ewe\" and \"oo\"? Speakers must still be able to perceive the difference between\nthese two segments.\n\nA Strategy for Research:\n- Using my corpus of spoken Lingit, determine first the extent to which there is\nlengthy preservatory coarticulation in the language.\n- Using that measure of rounding preservation, estimate the quality of hypothetical\nLingit \"ukw\"; from this quality estimate, estimate/test the 'perceptibility' of the\ncontrast between \"uk\", \"ukw\" and \"ukw\".\n- Do the same for \"kwee\", \"kwewe\" and \"kwoo\".\n\nWhat has been Obtained Thus Far:\n\nI have compiled an organized database of 315 Lingit sound files. The files within this\ndatabase contain the following sorts of syllables:\n\n- Rounded nucleus - Front coda\n- Unrounded nucleus - Front coda\n\n- Rounded nucleus - Back coda\n- Unrounded nucleus - Unrounded back coda\n- Unrounded nucleus - Unrounded back coda\n\n- Rounded onset - Non-high Vowel\n- ( Unrounded onset - Non-high Vowel ; not added yet)\n\n- Rounded onset - High Vowel (one token)\n\nThus (when fully completed), this database will permit measures of the severity of\npreservatory coarticulation in Lingit. No measures have yet been formally carried out,\nbut once they are, one can begin to truly pursue the research strategy laid out above.\n\nReferences\n\nCable, Seth. 2004. \"Rounding Harmony in Tlingit: Towards an Articulatory Analysis.\" Ms. MIT\n\nFlemming, Edward. 2001. \"Contrast and Perceptual Distinctiveness.\" Hayes, B., R.

      "content": "QUANTAL THEORY, ENHANCEMENT AND OVERLAP\nKenneth N. Stevens and Samuel Jay Keyser\nDecember 5, 2006\n1. INTRODUCTION\nA number of years ago (Stevens1972) it was observed that the relations between the\nacoustic and articulatory attributes of several distinctive features appeared to have\nquantal characteristics. That is, when a particular articulatory dimension is manipulated\nthrough a range of values, there is a nonlinear relation between this dimension and its\nacoustic consequence. The acoustic parameter is relatively insensitive to the change in\nthe articulatory parameter over one portion of its range and shows a relatively rapid\nchange with articulation over another part of its range. It was proposed that regions of\ninsensitivity of acoustic attributes to changes in articulation could provide a quantitative\nbasis for defining distinctive features.\nOver the years this initial quantal proposition has been observed to apply to a number\nof distinctive features across a range of languages (Stevens 1989, Keyser & Stevens\n2006). Based on these observations, we have attempted in Section 2 of this paper to\ndefine more clearly some of the general properties of the quantal relations and to indicate\nhow the \"quantal theory\" is one aspect of a more general theory that links the discrete\nabstract phonological representation to human production and perception of the speech\nsignal.\nEdward Flemming, David Gow, Stefanie Shattuck-Hufnagel, Kenneth Stevens, course materials for\n24.941J/6.543J/HST.727J/9.587J The Lexicon and Its Features, Spring 2007. MIT OpenCourseWare (http://ocw.mit.edu/),\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology. Downloaded on [DD Month YYYY].\n\nIn Section 3 we motivate the need to postulate additional acoustic and articulatory\nattributes that are superimposed on the attributes defined by the quantal relations in order\nto enhance the perceptual saliency of the underlying features. These enhancing gestures\nand the resulting acoustic cues are shown to take several forms. Section 4 describes how\nthe overlap of articulatory gestures in running speech can weaken some of the cues\navailable to the listener. Examples are given to show that, in spite of this overlap, enough\ncues usually remain to permit the listener to uncover the distinctive features intended by\nthe speaker. A summary of the principal points in the paper is given in Section 5.\n2. QUANTAL THEORY\nFigure 1 gives an example of a relation between an acoustic parameter in the sound\nradiated from the vocal tract when an articulatory parameter is varied continuously\nthrough a range of values. For this idealized articulatory/acoustic relation, there is a\nrange of values of the articulatory parameter, designated I, over which there is only a\nsmall variation in the acoustic parameter in the sound. Over an adjacent range II, there is\na relatively abrupt change in the parameter describing the acoustic result. Over this range\nthe acoustic parameter is quite sensitive to variations in articulation. In the adjacent\nregion III the acoustic parameter, once again, becomes relatively insensitive to\narticulatory changes. It is hypothesized that an articulatory/acoustic relation of this type\ndefines a distinctive feature. In region I the articulatory and relatively stable acoustic\nattributes are associated with the minus value for the feature, i.e., [-F], and region III\ndefines [+F].\nEdward Flemming, David Gow, Stefanie Shattuck-Hufnagel, Kenneth Stevens, course materials for\n24.941J/6.543J/HST.727J/9.587J The Lexicon and Its Features, Spring 2007. MIT OpenCourseWare (http://ocw.mit.edu/),\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology. Downloaded on [DD Month YYYY].\n\nIt is important to note that the feature-defining articulatory/acoustic relation in Figure\n1 is the result of a hypothetical experiment in which just one articulatory parameter is\nmanipulated, with all other articulatory parameters remaining constant. For example, if\nthe articulatory parameter represents the degree of vocal-tract constriction formed by the\ntongue blade, it is assumed that all other parameters, such as glottal opening, vocal-fold\nstiffness, stiffness of vocal-tract walls, subglottal pressure, etc. remain constant. An\narticulatory/acoustic relation is difficult to measure experimentally under such\nconstraints. Consequently the exploring of defining articulatory/acoustic relations is\nusually done by modeling the acoustic consequences of various articulatory movements.\nWith proper interpretation, however, the nature of certain articulatory/acoustic relations\ncan be inferred experimentally.\nThe canonical articulatory/acoustic relation in Figure 1 can take various forms. In\none form, already displayed in Figure 1, the relation shows two regions (I and III) within\nwhich the acoustic attribute is relatively stable over a range of articulatory displacements,\nand one region (II) in which small changes in articulation lead to relatively large changes\nin the acoustic parameter. An example of a quantal relation that takes this form is the\ninfluence of acoustic coupling between the second subglottal resonance and the second\nformant F2 of the vocal tract proper, which leads to avoidance of a particular range of F2\nfrequencies --- a range that separates vowels that are [-back] from vowels that are [+back]\n(Chi and Sonderegger 2004). Another example is the relatively abrupt relation between\nEdward Flemming, David Gow, Stefanie Shattuck-Hufnagel, Kenneth Stevens, course materials for\n24.941J/6.543J/HST.727J/9.587J The Lexicon and Its Features, Spring 2007.

Downloaded on [DD Month YYYY].\n\nformant number (e.g., F4 and F3) as the length of the front cavity for obstruent\nconsonants changes to form a [+anterior] to a [-anterior] feature (Stevens 2003).\nSome articulatory/acoustic relations exhibit a more abrupt change or threshold in the\nacoustic parameter in region II, so that a very minor change in articulation in effect\ncreates a different acoustic state, as shown in Figure 2a. An example of such an abrupt\nchange is the threshold of vocal-fold vibration as the stiffness of the vocal folds increases\nfrom a slack configuration (i.e., [-stiff vocal folds]) to a more stiff configuration ([+stiff\nvocal folds]) (Halle and Stevens 1971).\nIn another form, displayed in Figure 2b, the acoustically stable region is relatively\nflat, usually representing a maximum in an acoustic parameter such as the turbulence\nnoise generated at a constriction (Stevens 1998). To the left of this maximum, as the\nconstriction area becomes small, there is a gradual decrease in the amplitude of the noise,\nuntil, for zero area, there is no airflow and no turbulence noise. The same comment\napplies to the nasal opening; in this case, however, the nasal resonance disappears when\nthe area of the velopharyngeal port decreases to zero. This illustrates cases in which\nsetting a constriction area to zero, including flattening of an articulator that creates this\nconstriction in order to guarantee a complete closure, leads to a stable \"region\" with zero\narea. In Figure 2b this creation of a closure with pressure as for a stop consonant, is\nrepresented by zero constriction size. The articulatory/acoustic relations that define the\nfeatures [± continuant] and [± nasal] are of this type. One end of a continuum represents\nthe closure or end-point of an articulator, and the other end defines a maximum or\nEdward Flemming, David Gow, Stefanie Shattuck-Hufnagel, Kenneth Stevens, course materials for\n24.941J/6.543J/HST.727J/9.587J The Lexicon and Its Features, Spring 2007.

These defining attributes are properties of the\nhuman speech production system and are expected to be universal in language. It is\nhypothesized that the human speech production system is structured in such a way that\nthe sounds that it can generate and the articulatory attributes that produce these sounds\ndefine a set of quantal states. As will be noted later, additional acoustic and articulatory\nattributes may be added in certain contexts to enhance the perceptual saliency of the\ndefining acoustic attribute.\nThe distinctive features that emerge from the quantal relations are of two types (Halle\n1990). For one type, called articulator-free features, the \"articulator\" in the\nEdward Flemming, David Gow, Stefanie Shattuck-Hufnagel, Kenneth Stevens, course materials for\n24.941J/6.543J/HST.727J/9.587J The Lexicon and Its Features, Spring 2007. MIT OpenCourseWare (http://ocw.mit.edu/),\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology. Downloaded on [DD Month YYYY].\n\nacoustic/articulatory relation specifies a class of articulatory actions independent of the\narticulator that performs the actions. These include the features [vowel], [consonant] and\n[glide], and, within the consonant class, the features [sonorant] and [continuant]. The\ndefining acoustic attribute for segments with the consonantal feature is an abrupt change\nin the spectrum. The defining acoustic attribute for the articulator-free feature for vowels\nis a maximum in low-frequency amplitude in the region of the first formant. These\nattributes of abrupt spectrum change or maximum amplitude are called landmarks.\nA second type of feature, called articulator-bound, specifies actions of articulators.\nSome of these articulators are peripheral to the vocal-tract proper. These include the\nfeatures [stiff vocal folds], [spread glottis], [constricted glottis], and [nasal]. The defining\nacoustic attributes for these features are manifested in the speech signal in the vicinity of\nlandmarks, usually in the low-frequency region. Other articulator-bound features specify\nactions of articulators that are part of the vocal-tract proper. They are frequently called\nplace features. These specify the place of articulation of a constriction and the shaping of\nthe articulator that forms the constriction. The defining acoustic attributes for these\nfeatures describe the spectrum shape in the vicinity of the consonant landmark in the\nmiddle- and high-frequency region of 1 kHz to 8 kHz.\nThe distinctive features in a lexical item are typically represented in terms of a\nbranching tree diagram. In the discussion to follow we dispense with the tree\nrepresentation for ease of exposition. We focus instead on the aggregation of features\nthat make up the terminal symbols of any phonological tree, using a feature matrix for\nEdward Flemming, David Gow, Stefanie Shattuck-Hufnagel, Kenneth Stevens, course materials for\n24.941J/6.543J/HST.727J/9.587J The Lexicon and Its Features, Spring 2007.

Consider the matrix representation of the lexical item 'seem', given in\nTable 1.\n/s/\n/i/\n/m/\n+continuant\n+syllabic\n+sonorant\n+stiff\n-back\n+nasal\n+anterior\n+high\n+labial\n-dental\n+tense\nTable 1. Distinctive feature bundles that are required for the lexical representation of the\nword seem.\nThe bold-faced features in the second row are the articulator-free features. (Every\nphonological tree contains one such feature.) Depending on the articulator-free feature\nfor a segment, there are constraints on the possible articulator-bound features. For\nexample a fricative consonant has one articulator-free feature ([+continuant]) but is not\nspecified for [nasal]. And a stop consonant may have only certain contrasts in features\nrelating to place and laryngeal activity (voicing). Most segments, then, may have\nrelatively sparse inventories of features that are distinctive or contrastive.\nFor the most part, the defining articulatory attribute for a given articulator-bound\ndistinctive feature remains constant regardless of whatever articulator-free feature might\nco-occur with it in the same feature bundle. For example, for the labial nasal consonant\nEdward Flemming, David Gow, Stefanie Shattuck-Hufnagel, Kenneth Stevens, course materials for\n24.941J/6.543J/HST.727J/9.587J The Lexicon and Its Features, Spring 2007.

Downloaded on [DD Month YYYY].\n\n/m/, which is [+sonorant], the defining acoustic attribute for its place of articulation is\ndifferent from that for a labial stop consonant. The defining articulatory gesture for the\nplace feature, however, is the same for the nasal and the stop. Another example is the\nfeature [stiff vocal folds], which defines a contrast for obstruent consonants (i.e. specifies\nthe presence or absence of glottal vibration) and a different kind of acoustic contrast for\nvowels (i.e. specifies a high tone in contrast to a lower tone). Again, however, the\ndefining articulatory gesture is essentially the same.\nThere are other approaches to lexical representation. For example, Browman and\nGoldstein (1992) take the view that articulatory gestures are, in fact, primary and that\nlexical representations exist in terms of gestures rather than features. While we disagree\nwith the status they accord articulatory gestures, we agree that articulatory gestures are an\nimportant part of a full description of lexical representation.\n3. ENHANCEMENT\nQuantal theory seeks to explain why the inventory of distinctive features that make up\nthe phonologies of the languages of the world are what they are. It specifies defining\narticulatory and acoustic attributes for those distinctive features. It is not intended to be\nthe principal basis of a model that describes how human speakers generate running\nspeech or how listeners extract words from continuous speech. The surface\nrepresentation of words and word sequences includes not only the feature-defining\nEdward Flemming, David Gow, Stefanie Shattuck-Hufnagel, Kenneth Stevens, course materials for\n24.941J/6.543J/HST.727J/9.587J The Lexicon and Its Features, Spring 2007. MIT OpenCourseWare (http://ocw.mit.edu/),\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology. Downloaded on [DD Month YYYY].\n\nacoustic and articulatory attributes but also an array of articulatory gestures (and their\nacoustic consequences) that enhance the perceptual saliency of the defining attributes.\nThere are two general ways in which enhancement gestures may be added to a\ndefining gesture for a particular feature in a particular language.\n(1) An articulatory gesture is superimposed on the defining gesture, and thereby\nenhances the perceptual saliency of the feature. In effect the acoustic attribute\nresulting from the enhancing gesture increases the perceptual distance between\nthe feature and its neighbors. The enhancing gesture is not the defining gesture\nfor a distinctive feature in that language, and thus by itself does not represent a\ncontrast in the language. This type of enhancing gesture can be graded. It makes\nan adjustment to the defining acoustic attribute, and is implemented in all contexts\nin which the feature occurs. When a vowel is adjusted in this way, it has been\nsaid that the vowels are adjusted to give a uniform dispersion in the vowel space\n-- the so-called dispersion theory (Liljencrants & Lindblom 1972, Lindblom 1986,\nDiehl 1991).\nAn example of this type of enhancement for consonants is the rounding of the lips in\nthe production of /_/. This rounding tends to lower the natural frequency of the anterior\nportion of the vocal tract, so that the frequency of the lowest major spectrum prominence\nin the fricative spectrum is in the F3 range, well below the F4 or F5 range for the lowest\nspectrum prominence for the contrasting fricative consonant /s/. Another enhancing\nEdward Flemming, David Gow, Stefanie Shattuck-Hufnagel, Kenneth Stevens, course materials for\n24.941J/6.543J/HST.727J/9.587J The Lexicon and Its Features, Spring 2007. MIT OpenCourseWare (http://ocw.mit.edu/),\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology. Downloaded on [DD Month YYYY].\n\nadjustment that achieves a similar effect is the shaping of the tongue blade to assume a\ndomed configuration, thereby creating a longer narrow section in the oral cavity. Both of\nthese gestures create a configuration that strengthens the spectrum prominence in the F3\nrange.\nOther examples can be observed in vowels. In a five-vowel system, the nonlow back\nvowels are often produced with lip rounding, presumably to enhance the contrast with\nvowels having the feature [-back] (Stevens & Keyser 1989, Keyser & Stevens 2006).\nSimilarly, the nonlow front vowels are often produced with lip spreading, thereby\nstrengthening the acoustic attribute that defines [-back]. For these types of enhancement,\nthe enhancing gesture itself does not create the contrast. These enhancements are usually\nimplemented for all contexts in which the feature occurs.\n(2) A second possible type of enhancement for a feature introduces a new acoustic\nattribute that is separate from the defining acoustic attribute for the feature. The\nnew acoustic attributes created by this type of enhancement introduces additional\nperceptual cues to the feature. The form this enhancement takes can depend on\nthe context in which the feature occurs. These types of enhancement are\nintroduced in regions of the speech signal that are adjacent to the times when the\ndefining acoustic attributes appear. The enhancements can be time-varying\nattributes, as opposed to the defining attributes which consist of target acoustic\nmeasures.\nEdward Flemming, David Gow, Stefanie Shattuck-Hufnagel, Kenneth Stevens, course materials for\n24.941J/6.543J/HST.727J/9.587J The Lexicon and Its Features, Spring 2007. MIT OpenCourseWare (http://ocw.mit.edu/),\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology. Downloaded on [DD Month YYYY].\n\nA typical example of this second type of enhancement is the movement of the\nformant frequencies at the release of an obstruent consonant. These formant transitions\nmay indicate the starting frequency of a formant at the time of consonant release and the\nfrequency of the formant in the following vowel. Or the time course of the formant\nmovements may play a role. Another example is the formant movements that may be\nintroduced toward the end of a vowel, as in the nonlow vowels in English. In this case,\nthe tense vowels often are produced with F2 movements toward more extreme values,\nand the lax vowels show movements toward more central values. These offglides can be\nregarded as enhancements of the vowel features [high] and [tense]. A number of\nexamples of this second type of enhancement are given in Keyser and Stevens (2006).\nThere are some articulatory gestures for consonants that produce a particular defining\nacoustic property during the consonant and a different acoustic property in the vowel\ninterval adjacent to the consonant. We consider the acoustic property in the vowel region\nto be an enhancement. This property provides a cue that is used by a listener to help to\nidentify the consonantal segment. Examples of this kind include the feature [+stiff vocal\nfolds] which causes an inhibition of glottal vibration in the consonant obstruent region\nand an increased fundamental frequency of glottal vibration in the following vowel\nadjacent to the consonant (House and Fairbanks 1953). Another example is the feature\n[+nasal] for a consonant which has a particular defining acoustic attribute in the nasal\nmurmur and a somewhat different enhancing attribute in the adjacent vowel region. There\nis evidence, however, that in cases like these, the timing and extent of the attribute in the\nadjacent vowel is not completely automatic, but rather, depending upon the language, is\nEdward Flemming, David Gow, Stefanie Shattuck-Hufnagel, Kenneth Stevens, course materials for\n24.941J/6.543J/HST.727J/9.587J The Lexicon and Its Features, Spring 2007.

In some cases, it may be influenced by prosodic\nfactors (Hanson 2004).\nThe acoustic manifestations of alveolar consonants in English (particularly the\nvoiceless /t/) exhibit a much wider range of variability than that observed for other places\nof articulation for consonants. In some contexts these alveolar consonants have acoustic\nproperties (and corresponding articulatory attributes) that appear to be related only\nindirectly to the defining attributes for the place and voicing features for the tongue-blade\nconsonants. For example, the flap that is often used in unstressed context (like writer or\nrider) signals the place feature, but often without a burst, although there is still evidence\nfor a coronal place of articulation. Or, in word-final position like /t/ in that boy, there\nmay be no alveolar closure for /t/, but often a glottal stop is produced in that position. Or\nagain, in a word like Alvin, the alveolar lateral consonant /l/ is often produced with no\ntongue blade closure.\nIt has often been suggested that the alveolar places of articulation (at least for stops)\nbe given special status (cf. Paradis & Prunet 1991, Butcher 2006). One proposal is that\nthis stop place be considered as a sort of default place of articulation. In this view cues\nfor labial and velar stops follow the normal pattern of defining gestures supplemented by\nenhancements, whereas the alveolar consonants are segments that do not have the\nattributes expected of labials and velars, but nonetheless are stops (cf. Lahiri and Reetz\n2002).\nEdward Flemming, David Gow, Stefanie Shattuck-Hufnagel, Kenneth Stevens, course materials for\n24.941J/6.543J/HST.727J/9.587J The Lexicon and Its Features, Spring 2007.

OVERLAP\nWe have observed that multiple cues may be available to a listener to help identify\nthe distinctive features that underlie the segments in an utterance. Some of these cues are\ndirectly related to the definition of the feature based on quantal articulatory/acoustic\nrelations. Other cues can be regarded as having an enhancing role that contributes to the\nperceptual saliency of the feature. These various cues for a given feature may be\ndistributed over time. Some can be \"internal\" to the segment and not strongly influenced\nby neighboring segments, and others are more associated with the edges of the segments,\nand may be more context-dependent. In running speech, there is often overlap of the\narticulatory gestures that produce these various acoustic cues in adjacent segments. A\nconsequence of this overlap is a weakening of some cues and sometimes a masking or\nobliteration of cues.\nA simple example of articulatory overlap occurs in an utterance containing a\nsequence of two stop consonants, as in the casually produced utterance top tag. A\nspectrogram of this utterance is shown in Figure 3. Each of the stop consonants like /p/\nand /t/ is normally defined by a particular type of noise burst --- a relatively flat spectrum\nfor /p/ and a spectrum with greater amplitude in the high-frequency range for /t/. If a\nconsonant like /p/ were in intervocalic position, some enhancing attributes would be\ngenerated as the articulators move from the region associated with the preceding vowel to\nthe region of the defining gesture. Other enhancing gestures occur during the transition\nto the following segment. In this example, the transition toward the labial closure for /p/\nEdward Flemming, David Gow, Stefanie Shattuck-Hufnagel, Kenneth Stevens, course materials for\n24.941J/6.543J/HST.727J/9.587J The Lexicon and Its Features, Spring 2007. MIT OpenCourseWare (http://ocw.mit.edu/),\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology. Downloaded on [DD Month YYYY].\n\ngenerates enhancing cues for the labial place of articulation. However, the noise burst\nthat would normally signal the labial place of articulation is obliterated because the\ntongue blade closure for /t/ occurs before the lip closure for /p/ is released. Any cue for\nthe labial place of articulation immediately prior to the /t/ release is probably also\nobscured. In the case of /t/, there is little direct evidence of the presence of the alveolar\nplace during the time preceding the /t/ release. The alveolar burst, however, provides\nstrong evidence for alveolar place, as does the transition from this burst into the\nfollowing vowel /Q/. Thus some cues exist for /t/, but only weaker cues for /p/. The\n\"defining\" cue for /p/ is actually obliterated.\nPerhaps a more extreme example of gestural overlap occurs with a casual production\nof the sequence I can't go (see Figure 4). Such a sequence can sometimes be produced\nwith no alveolar closure to provide evidence for the cluster /nt/. However, the vowel /Q/\nis nasalized over much of its length, and the vowel ends with glottalization. In spite of\nthese apparent modifications or deletions of significant cues for the features [nasal],\n[tongue blade] (for nasal consonant), [-continuant] (for alveolar consonant), and [tongue\nblade] (for alveolar consonant), there are still sufficient cues for a listener to decode the\nutterance. The nasalization of the vowel /Q/ can be interpreted as an enhancing attribute\nindicating the presence of a nasal consonant; the glottalization is an enhancing attribute\nfor a syllable-final /t/; and phonotactics require that the preceding nasal consonant be /n/.\nThus for this sequence of three syllables and six segments, the defining attributes are\nobliterated for features in two of the segments, but the enhancing attributes for these\nfeatures contain sufficient cues to preserve intelligibility of the phrase.\nEdward Flemming, David Gow, Stefanie Shattuck-Hufnagel, Kenneth Stevens, course materials for\n24.941J/6.543J/HST.727J/9.587J The Lexicon and Its Features, Spring 2007. MIT OpenCourseWare (http://ocw.mit.edu/),\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology. Downloaded on [DD Month YYYY].\n\nAnother common example is the overlap of a sequence of a reduced vowel / / and a\nfollowing nasal consonant /n/, to produce a syllabic /n/ as in the word lesson. This\nsyllabic nasal contains acoustic cues for the presence of a vowel (a maximum in low-\nfrequency amplitude) and for a nasal consonant (a nasal murmur). However, the low-\nfrequency spectrum prominence for the syllabic nasal is below the frequency normally\nrequired for a vowel, and there is no abrupt spectrum discontinuity that is a defining\nattribute for a consonant. Nevertheless there are sufficient enhancing cues that the\nsyllabic nasal can be identified as a sequence of reduced vowel plus nasal consonant.\nExamples of a different kind involve the various acoustic manifestations of the\nsegment /D/ in English, usually in function words. These include the apparent stop-like\nversion in a sequence like back the team, or the nasal version in the sequence win those\ngames, or the apparent lateral manifestation in will they come (Manuel 1995). In these\ncases the [+continuant] feature for the obstruent consonant is not realized as such and\nappears as stop-like or nasal-like or lateral-like. However, we think that the place feature\nfor /D/ should be classified as [+dental], which distinguishes /D/ from the [-dental] /s/.\nAn enhancing gesture for this feature appears in the second formant prominence at the\nrelease of the consonant into the following vowel. This frequency is lower than what\nwould be observed if the consonant were produced as an alveolar consonant such as /t/ or\n/n/.\nEdward Flemming, David Gow, Stefanie Shattuck-Hufnagel, Kenneth Stevens, course materials for\n24.941J/6.543J/HST.727J/9.587J The Lexicon and Its Features, Spring 2007.

CONCLUSION\nThe theoretical framework presented above rests upon the following:\n1. The anatomy and physiology of the human sound generating system assumes a\nset of discrete \"states\" based on \"quantal\" relations between certain articulatory\nparameters and their resulting acoustic properties. Each of these states defines\nthe basic articulatory/acoustic attributes for the distinctive features that make up\nthe universal inventory of phonemic contrasts available for use in language.\n2. These defining acoustic and articulatory attributes may be augmented by the\nintroduction of additional gestures that increase the perceptual saliency of the\nfeature. The enhancing gestures may be language dependent and may depend\non the context in which the feature appears.\n3. In running speech the acoustic manifestations of a given distinctive feature for\nan underlying segment in an utterance may be modified by gestural overlap.\nEnhancing acoustic cues usually preserves evidence for the distinctive feature,\neven though the defining acoustic cue is weakened or even obliterated.\n6.

Stevens and Samuel Jay Keyser\nDecember 5, 2006\n1. INTRODUCTION\nA number of years ago (Stevens1972) it was observed that the relations between the\nacoustic and articulatory attributes of several distinctive features appeared to have\nquantal characteristics. That is, when a particular articulatory dimension is manipulated\nthrough a range of values, there is a nonlinear relation between this dimension and its\nacoustic consequence. The acoustic parameter is relatively insensitive to the change in\nthe articulatory parameter over one portion of its range and shows a relatively rapid\nchange with articulation over another part of its range. It was proposed that regions of\ninsensitivity of acoustic attributes to changes in articulation could provide a quantitative\nbasis for defining distinctive features.\nOver the years this initial quantal proposition has been observed to apply to a number\nof distinctive features across a range of languages (Stevens 1989, Keyser & Stevens\n2006). Based on these observations, we have attempted in Section 2 of this paper to\ndefine more clearly some of the general properties of the quantal relations and to indicate\nhow the \"quantal theory\" is one aspect of a more general theory that links the discrete\nabstract phonological representation to human production and perception of the speech\nsignal.\n\nIn Section 3 we motivate the need to postulate additional acoustic and articulatory\nattributes that are superimposed on the attributes defined by the quantal relations in order\nto enhance the perceptual saliency of the underlying features. These enhancing gestures\nand the resulting acoustic cues are shown to take several forms. Section 4 describes how\nthe overlap of articulatory gestures in running speech can weaken some of the cues\navailable to the listener. Examples are given to show that, in spite of this overlap, enough\ncues usually remain to permit the listener to uncover the distinctive features intended by\nthe speaker. A summary of the principal points in the paper is given in Section 5.\n2. QUANTAL THEORY\nFigure 1 gives an example of a relation between an acoustic parameter in the sound\nradiated from the vocal tract when an articulatory parameter is varied continuously\nthrough a range of values. For this idealized articulatory/acoustic relation, there is a\nrange of values of the articulatory parameter, designated I, over which there is only a\nsmall variation in the acoustic parameter in the sound. Over an adjacent range II, there is\na relatively abrupt change in the parameter describing the acoustic result. Over this range\nthe acoustic parameter is quite sensitive to variations in articulation. In the adjacent\nregion III the acoustic parameter, once again, becomes relatively insensitive to\narticulatory changes. It is hypothesized that an articulatory/acoustic relation of this type\ndefines a distinctive feature. In region I the articulatory and relatively stable acoustic\nattributes are associated with the minus value for the feature, i.e., [-F], and region III\ndefines [+F].\n\nIt is important to note that the feature-defining articulatory/acoustic relation in Figure\n1 is the result of a hypothetical experiment in which just one articulatory parameter is\nmanipulated, with all other articulatory parameters remaining constant. For example, if\nthe articulatory parameter represents the degree of vocal-tract constriction formed by the\ntongue blade, it is assumed that all other parameters, such as glottal opening, vocal-fold\nstiffness, stiffness of vocal-tract walls, subglottal pressure, etc. remain constant. An\narticulatory/acoustic relation is difficult to measure experimentally under such\nconstraints. Consequently the exploring of defining articulatory/acoustic relations is\nusually done by modeling the acoustic consequences of various articulatory movements.\nWith proper interpretation, however, the nature of certain articulatory/acoustic relations\ncan be inferred experimentally.\nThe canonical articulatory/acoustic relation in Figure 1 can take various forms. In\none form, already displayed in Figure 1, the relation shows two regions (I and III) within\nwhich the acoustic attribute is relatively stable over a range of articulatory displacements,\nand one region (II) in which small changes in articulation lead to relatively large changes\nin the acoustic parameter. An example of a quantal relation that takes this form is the\ninfluence of acoustic coupling between the second subglottal resonance and the second\nformant F2 of the vocal tract proper, which leads to avoidance of a particular range of F2\nfrequencies --- a range that separates vowels that are [-back] from vowels that are [+back]\n(Chi and Sonderegger 2004). Another example is the relatively abrupt relation between\n\nformant number (e.g., F4 and F3) as the length of the front cavity for obstruent\nconsonants changes to form a [+anterior] to a [-anterior] feature (Stevens 2003).\nSome articulatory/acoustic relations exhibit a more abrupt change or threshold in the\nacoustic parameter in region II, so that a very minor change in articulation in effect\ncreates a different acoustic state, as shown in Figure 2a. An example of such an abrupt\nchange is the threshold of vocal-fold vibration as the stiffness of the vocal folds increases\nfrom a slack configuration (i.e., [-stiff vocal folds]) to a more stiff configuration ([+stiff\nvocal folds]) (Halle and Stevens 1971).\nIn another form, displayed in Figure 2b, the acoustically stable region is relatively\nflat, usually representing a maximum in an acoustic parameter such as the turbulence\nnoise generated at a constriction (Stevens 1998). To the left of this maximum, as the\nconstriction area becomes small, there is a gradual decrease in the amplitude of the noise,\nuntil, for zero area, there is no airflow and no turbulence noise. The same comment\napplies to the nasal opening; in this case, however, the nasal resonance disappears when\nthe area of the velopharyngeal port decreases to zero. This illustrates cases in which\nsetting a constriction area to zero, including flattening of an articulator that creates this\nconstriction in order to guarantee a complete closure, leads to a stable \"region\" with zero\narea. In Figure 2b this creation of a closure with pressure as for a stop consonant, is\nrepresented by zero constriction size. The articulatory/acoustic relations that define the\nfeatures [± continuant] and [± nasal] are of this type. One end of a continuum represents\nthe closure or end-point of an articulator, and the other end defines a maximum or\n\nminimum in an acoustic attribute, but the intervening region may not be as abrupt as that\nschematized in Figures 1 and 2a.\nBy defining a quantal acoustic property in the manner illustrated in the above\nexamples, it is implied that this defining attribute has a particular numerical value or has\na value in a particular range, possibly with appropriate normalization to the speaker.\nThus a defining quantal property does not specify an acoustic change or contour, such as\nthe movement of a formant frequency over a particular range or with a certain trajectory.\nThe role of time-varying parameters as enhancing cues to phonological contrasts will be\ndiscussed in the following section on enhancement.\nWe hypothesize that a quantal acoustic/articulatory relation underlies each distinctive\nfeature, and consequently each feature can be said to be based on a defining acoustic\nattribute and a defining articulatory range. These defining attributes are properties of the\nhuman speech production system and are expected to be universal in language. It is\nhypothesized that the human speech production system is structured in such a way that\nthe sounds that it can generate and the articulatory attributes that produce these sounds\ndefine a set of quantal states. As will be noted later, additional acoustic and articulatory\nattributes may be added in certain contexts to enhance the perceptual saliency of the\ndefining acoustic attribute.\nThe distinctive features that emerge from the quantal relations are of two types (Halle\n1990). For one type, called articulator-free features, the \"articulator\" in the\n\nacoustic/articulatory relation specifies a class of articulatory actions independent of the\narticulator that performs the actions. These include the features [vowel], [consonant] and\n[glide], and, within the consonant class, the features [sonorant] and [continuant]. The\ndefining acoustic attribute for segments with the consonantal feature is an abrupt change\nin the spectrum. The defining acoustic attribute for the articulator-free feature for vowels\nis a maximum in low-frequency amplitude in the region of the first formant. These\nattributes of abrupt spectrum change or maximum amplitude are called landmarks.\nA second type of feature, called articulator-bound, specifies actions of articulators.\nSome of these articulators are peripheral to the vocal-tract proper. These include the\nfeatures [stiff vocal folds], [spread glottis], [constricted glottis], and [nasal]. The defining\nacoustic attributes for these features are manifested in the speech signal in the vicinity of\nlandmarks, usually in the low-frequency region. Other articulator-bound features specify\nactions of articulators that are part of the vocal-tract proper. They are frequently called\nplace features. These specify the place of articulation of a constriction and the shaping of\nthe articulator that forms the constriction. The defining acoustic attributes for these\nfeatures describe the spectrum shape in the vicinity of the consonant landmark in the\nmiddle- and high-frequency region of 1 kHz to 8 kHz.\nThe distinctive features in a lexical item are typically represented in terms of a\nbranching tree diagram. In the discussion to follow we dispense with the tree\nrepresentation for ease of exposition. We focus instead on the aggregation of features\nthat make up the terminal symbols of any phonological tree, using a feature matrix for\n\nour purposes. Consider the matrix representation of the lexical item 'seem', given in\nTable 1.\n/s/\n/i/\n/m/\n+continuant\n+syllabic\n+sonorant\n+stiff\n-back\n+nasal\n+anterior\n+high\n+labial\n-dental\n+tense\nTable 1. Distinctive feature bundles that are required for the lexical representation of the\nword seem.\nThe bold-faced features in the second row are the articulator-free features. (Every\nphonological tree contains one such feature.) Depending on the articulator-free feature\nfor a segment, there are constraints on the possible articulator-bound features. For\nexample a fricative consonant has one articulator-free feature ([+continuant]) but is not\nspecified for [nasal]. And a stop consonant may have only certain contrasts in features\nrelating to place and laryngeal activity (voicing). Most segments, then, may have\nrelatively sparse inventories of features that are distinctive or contrastive.\nFor the most part, the defining articulatory attribute for a given articulator-bound\ndistinctive feature remains constant regardless of whatever articulator-free feature might\nco-occur with it in the same feature bundle. For example, for the labial nasal consonant\n\n/m/, which is [+sonorant], the defining acoustic attribute for its place of articulation is\ndifferent from that for a labial stop consonant. The defining articulatory gesture for the\nplace feature, however, is the same for the nasal and the stop. Another example is the\nfeature [stiff vocal folds], which defines a contrast for obstruent consonants (i.e. specifies\nthe presence or absence of glottal vibration) and a different kind of acoustic contrast for\nvowels (i.e. specifies a high tone in contrast to a lower tone). Again, however, the\ndefining articulatory gesture is essentially the same.\nThere are other approaches to lexical representation. For example, Browman and\nGoldstein (1992) take the view that articulatory gestures are, in fact, primary and that\nlexical representations exist in terms of gestures rather than features. While we disagree\nwith the status they accord articulatory gestures, we agree that articulatory gestures are an\nimportant part of a full description of lexical representation.\n3. ENHANCEMENT\nQuantal theory seeks to explain why the inventory of distinctive features that make up\nthe phonologies of the languages of the world are what they are. It specifies defining\narticulatory and acoustic attributes for those distinctive features. It is not intended to be\nthe principal basis of a model that describes how human speakers generate running\nspeech or how listeners extract words from continuous speech. The surface\nrepresentation of words and word sequences includes not only the feature-defining\n\nacoustic and articulatory attributes but also an array of articulatory gestures (and their\nacoustic consequences) that enhance the perceptual saliency of the defining attributes.\nThere are two general ways in which enhancement gestures may be added to a\ndefining gesture for a particular feature in a particular language.\n(1) An articulatory gesture is superimposed on the defining gesture, and thereby\nenhances the perceptual saliency of the feature. In effect the acoustic attribute\nresulting from the enhancing gesture increases the perceptual distance between\nthe feature and its neighbors. The enhancing gesture is not the defining gesture\nfor a distinctive feature in that language, and thus by itself does not represent a\ncontrast in the language. This type of enhancing gesture can be graded. It makes\nan adjustment to the defining acoustic attribute, and is implemented in all contexts\nin which the feature occurs. When a vowel is adjusted in this way, it has been\nsaid that the vowels are adjusted to give a uniform dispersion in the vowel space\n-- the so-called dispersion theory (Liljencrants & Lindblom 1972, Lindblom 1986,\nDiehl 1991).\nAn example of this type of enhancement for consonants is the rounding of the lips in\nthe production of /_/. This rounding tends to lower the natural frequency of the anterior\nportion of the vocal tract, so that the frequency of the lowest major spectrum prominence\nin the fricative spectrum is in the F3 range, well below the F4 or F5 range for the lowest\nspectrum prominence for the contrasting fricative consonant /s/. Another enhancing\n\nadjustment that achieves a similar effect is the shaping of the tongue blade to assume a\ndomed configuration, thereby creating a longer narrow section in the oral cavity. Both of\nthese gestures create a configuration that strengthens the spectrum prominence in the F3\nrange.\nOther examples can be observed in vowels. In a five-vowel system, the nonlow back\nvowels are often produced with lip rounding, presumably to enhance the contrast with\nvowels having the feature [-back] (Stevens & Keyser 1989, Keyser & Stevens 2006).\nSimilarly, the nonlow front vowels are often produced with lip spreading, thereby\nstrengthening the acoustic attribute that defines [-back]. For these types of enhancement,\nthe enhancing gesture itself does not create the contrast. These enhancements are usually\nimplemented for all contexts in which the feature occurs.\n(2) A second possible type of enhancement for a feature introduces a new acoustic\nattribute that is separate from the defining acoustic attribute for the feature. The\nnew acoustic attributes created by this type of enhancement introduces additional\nperceptual cues to the feature. The form this enhancement takes can depend on\nthe context in which the feature occurs. These types of enhancement are\nintroduced in regions of the speech signal that are adjacent to the times when the\ndefining acoustic attributes appear. The enhancements can be time-varying\nattributes, as opposed to the defining attributes which consist of target acoustic\nmeasures.\n\nA typical example of this second type of enhancement is the movement of the\nformant frequencies at the release of an obstruent consonant. These formant transitions\nmay indicate the starting frequency of a formant at the time of consonant release and the\nfrequency of the formant in the following vowel. Or the time course of the formant\nmovements may play a role. Another example is the formant movements that may be\nintroduced toward the end of a vowel, as in the nonlow vowels in English. In this case,\nthe tense vowels often are produced with F2 movements toward more extreme values,\nand the lax vowels show movements toward more central values. These offglides can be\nregarded as enhancements of the vowel features [high] and [tense]. A number of\nexamples of this second type of enhancement are given in Keyser and Stevens (2006).\nThere are some articulatory gestures for consonants that produce a particular defining\nacoustic property during the consonant and a different acoustic property in the vowel\ninterval adjacent to the consonant. We consider the acoustic property in the vowel region\nto be an enhancement. This property provides a cue that is used by a listener to help to\nidentify the consonantal segment. Examples of this kind include the feature [+stiff vocal\nfolds] which causes an inhibition of glottal vibration in the consonant obstruent region\nand an increased fundamental frequency of glottal vibration in the following vowel\nadjacent to the consonant (House and Fairbanks 1953). Another example is the feature\n[+nasal] for a consonant which has a particular defining acoustic attribute in the nasal\nmurmur and a somewhat different enhancing attribute in the adjacent vowel region. There\nis evidence, however, that in cases like these, the timing and extent of the attribute in the\nadjacent vowel is not completely automatic, but rather, depending upon the language, is\n\nunder speaker control (Butcher 1999). In some cases, it may be influenced by prosodic\nfactors (Hanson 2004).\nThe acoustic manifestations of alveolar consonants in English (particularly the\nvoiceless /t/) exhibit a much wider range of variability than that observed for other places\nof articulation for consonants. In some contexts these alveolar consonants have acoustic\nproperties (and corresponding articulatory attributes) that appear to be related only\nindirectly to the defining attributes for the place and voicing features for the tongue-blade\nconsonants. For example, the flap that is often used in unstressed context (like writer or\nrider) signals the place feature, but often without a burst, although there is still evidence\nfor a coronal place of articulation. Or, in word-final position like /t/ in that boy, there\nmay be no alveolar closure for /t/, but often a glottal stop is produced in that position. Or\nagain, in a word like Alvin, the alveolar lateral consonant /l/ is often produced with no\ntongue blade closure.\nIt has often been suggested that the alveolar places of articulation (at least for stops)\nbe given special status (cf. Paradis & Prunet 1991, Butcher 2006). One proposal is that\nthis stop place be considered as a sort of default place of articulation. In this view cues\nfor labial and velar stops follow the normal pattern of defining gestures supplemented by\nenhancements, whereas the alveolar consonants are segments that do not have the\nattributes expected of labials and velars, but nonetheless are stops (cf. Lahiri and Reetz\n2002).\n\n4. OVERLAP\nWe have observed that multiple cues may be available to a listener to help identify\nthe distinctive features that underlie the segments in an utterance. Some of these cues are\ndirectly related to the definition of the feature based on quantal articulatory/acoustic\nrelations. Other cues can be regarded as having an enhancing role that contributes to the\nperceptual saliency of the feature. These various cues for a given feature may be\ndistributed over time. Some can be \"internal\" to the segment and not strongly influenced\nby neighboring segments, and others are more associated with the edges of the segments,\nand may be more context-dependent. In running speech, there is often overlap of the\narticulatory gestures that produce these various acoustic cues in adjacent segments. A\nconsequence of this overlap is a weakening of some cues and sometimes a masking or\nobliteration of cues.\nA simple example of articulatory overlap occurs in an utterance containing a\nsequence of two stop consonants, as in the casually produced utterance top tag. A\nspectrogram of this utterance is shown in Figure 3. Each of the stop consonants like /p/\nand /t/ is normally defined by a particular type of noise burst --- a relatively flat spectrum\nfor /p/ and a spectrum with greater amplitude in the high-frequency range for /t/. If a\nconsonant like /p/ were in intervocalic position, some enhancing attributes would be\ngenerated as the articulators move from the region associated with the preceding vowel to\nthe region of the defining gesture. Other enhancing gestures occur during the transition\nto the following segment. In this example, the transition toward the labial closure for /p/\n\ngenerates enhancing cues for the labial place of articulation. However, the noise burst\nthat would normally signal the labial place of articulation is obliterated because the\ntongue blade closure for /t/ occurs before the lip closure for /p/ is released. Any cue for\nthe labial place of articulation immediately prior to the /t/ release is probably also\nobscured. In the case of /t/, there is little direct evidence of the presence of the alveolar\nplace during the time preceding the /t/ release. The alveolar burst, however, provides\nstrong evidence for alveolar place, as does the transition from this burst into the\nfollowing vowel /Q/. Thus some cues exist for /t/, but only weaker cues for /p/. The\n\"defining\" cue for /p/ is actually obliterated.\nPerhaps a more extreme example of gestural overlap occurs with a casual production\nof the sequence I can't go (see Figure 4). Such a sequence can sometimes be produced\nwith no alveolar closure to provide evidence for the cluster /nt/. However, the vowel /Q/\nis nasalized over much of its length, and the vowel ends with glottalization. In spite of\nthese apparent modifications or deletions of significant cues for the features [nasal],\n[tongue blade] (for nasal consonant), [-continuant] (for alveolar consonant), and [tongue\nblade] (for alveolar consonant), there are still sufficient cues for a listener to decode the\nutterance. The nasalization of the vowel /Q/ can be interpreted as an enhancing attribute\nindicating the presence of a nasal consonant; the glottalization is an enhancing attribute\nfor a syllable-final /t/; and phonotactics require that the preceding nasal consonant be /n/.\nThus for this sequence of three syllables and six segments, the defining attributes are\nobliterated for features in two of the segments, but the enhancing attributes for these\nfeatures contain sufficient cues to preserve intelligibility of the phrase.\n\nAnother common example is the overlap of a sequence of a reduced vowel / / and a\nfollowing nasal consonant /n/, to produce a syllabic /n/ as in the word lesson. This\nsyllabic nasal contains acoustic cues for the presence of a vowel (a maximum in low-\nfrequency amplitude) and for a nasal consonant (a nasal murmur). However, the low-\nfrequency spectrum prominence for the syllabic nasal is below the frequency normally\nrequired for a vowel, and there is no abrupt spectrum discontinuity that is a defining\nattribute for a consonant. Nevertheless there are sufficient enhancing cues that the\nsyllabic nasal can be identified as a sequence of reduced vowel plus nasal consonant.\nExamples of a different kind involve the various acoustic manifestations of the\nsegment /D/ in English, usually in function words. These include the apparent stop-like\nversion in a sequence like back the team, or the nasal version in the sequence win those\ngames, or the apparent lateral manifestation in will they come (Manuel 1995). In these\ncases the [+continuant] feature for the obstruent consonant is not realized as such and\nappears as stop-like or nasal-like or lateral-like. However, we think that the place feature\nfor /D/ should be classified as [+dental], which distinguishes /D/ from the [-dental] /s/.\nAn enhancing gesture for this feature appears in the second formant prominence at the\nrelease of the consonant into the following vowel. This frequency is lower than what\nwould be observed if the consonant were produced as an alveolar consonant such as /t/ or\n/n/.\n\n5. CONCLUSION\nThe theoretical framework presented above rests upon the following:\n1. The anatomy and physiology of the human sound generating system assumes a\nset of discrete \"states\" based on \"quantal\" relations between certain articulatory\nparameters and their resulting acoustic properties. Each of these states defines\nthe basic articulatory/acoustic attributes for the distinctive features that make up\nthe universal inventory of phonemic contrasts available for use in language.\n2. These defining acoustic and articulatory attributes may be augmented by the\nintroduction of additional gestures that increase the perceptual saliency of the\nfeature. The enhancing gestures may be language dependent and may depend\non the context in which the feature appears.\n3. In running speech the acoustic manifestations of a given distinctive feature for\nan underlying segment in an utterance may be modified by gestural overlap.\nEnhancing acoustic cues usually preserves evidence for the distinctive feature,\neven though the defining acoustic cue is weakened or even obliterated.\n6.
