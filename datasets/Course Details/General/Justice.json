  "syllabus_content": "Course Meeting Times\n\nLectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session\n\nPrerequisites\n\nNone\n\nCourse Description\n\nThis course explores the ideal of social justice. What we want to know is what makes a society just. Must a society protect individual liberties in order to be just? Which ones? Must a society ensure equality in order to be just? What kind? Can a society ensure both liberty and equality? We will approach these questions by studying three opposing theories of justice--utilitarianism, libertarianism, and egalitarian liberalism--each foundational to contemporary political thought and discourse.\n\nCourse Requirements\n\nPapers\n\nThis course is a HASS-D/H and Communication Intensive (CI) subject; you must write three papers of 6-7 (double-spaced) pages each. You must also revise and resubmit at least one paper. The procedure for rewriting a paper is as follows. Once your first paper has been graded, it will be returned to you with comments. You may then decide whether you wish to rewrite the first paper. If you choose to do so, you must ensure that your rewrite is responsive to the comments on the first version. The grade on the rewrite will depend on how well you have addressed the comments. The grade on the rewrite may be lower than the original grade if the rewrite is not responsive to the comments.\n\nYou are not required to rewrite the first paper. You may rewrite the second paper instead. Or you may rewrite both the first paper and the second paper. However, there are no rewrites on the third paper. When you submit a rewrite, you must also include the original version with the grader's comments.\n\nThe final grade for papers that are rewritten will be a weighted combination of the grade on the first version and the rewrite, with the rewrite counting twice as much as the first version. The paper topics will be given out ahead of time. If you wish to write on a topic of your own design, please submit a short proposal for approval. Papers on unapproved topics will not be accepted.\n\nQuizzes\n\nThere will be three quizzes. The questions are designed to help you prepare for writing your papers. For each quiz, you must submit a response of no more than 1-2 (double-spaced) pages.\n\nParticipation\n\nThe remainder of your grade will be based on your oral participation--the oral communications part of the class. To pass this requirement, you must regularly attend lecture and recitation. To do well, you must participate thoughtfully in class discussions, in lecture and in recitation. The best way to prepare yourself to make informed and thoughtful contributions is to devote time to careful study of the assigned texts. You will need time and effort to understand and be able to evaluate the claims and arguments in them. To help you, there are questions listed after each reading assignment. Think about these questions as you are reading.\n\nGrading\n\nACTIVITIES\n\nPERCENTAGES\n\nFirst paper\n\n15%\n\nSecond paper\n\n20%\n\nThird paper\n\n25%\n\nQuizzes (3)\n\n15%\n\nOral participation\n\n25%",

First, he tries to undermine the\nargument for more extensive redistribution. He does this by challenging all\nprinciples of justice that require a \"pattern,\" whether a pattern of income, or\nof well-being, or of opportunity, etc. Second, he argues for a historical\nconception of justice, according to which \"[w]hatever happens from a just\nsituation by just steps is itself just,\" no matter what the resulting pattern of\nproperty, opportunity, well-being, etc.\nDoes Nozick succeed in showing that all redistribution, other than to return\nstolen goods, is unjust?

Not because the pains of those who are forced to conform always outweigh the pains of the\nmajority distressed by seeing unconventional conduct\n\nb. Because the most important costs of \"the despotism of custom\" fall on the entire community\n\n5. What are the costs to everyone when conventional norms and prevailing practices are enforced?\n\na. Prevailing customs may be based on misunderstanding of what makes people happy; to\ndiscover the best customs/ways of living, there must be room for \"experiments in living\"\n\nb. Not every good custom is suited to every character or every person; if (most) persons are to\nbe happy, there must be great \"variety of characters,\" each with their own supporting customs\n\nc. Accepting even a good, suitable character or custom merely \"as custom\" does not deploy or\ndevelop a human being's distinctive faculties\n\nd. Developing one's own character, and living a life that is the product of one's own reasoned,\nchoices--i.e., \"individuality\"--requires having the freedom to depart from prevailing\ncustom; and \"individuality\" is \"one of the principal ingredients in human happiness\"\n\n6. Two potential objections to Mill's argument:\n\na. Are all restrictions on offensive or hateful speech impermissible? Are they impermissible\nbecause they pose a threat to a people being \"intellectually active\"?\n\nb. Are all paternalist restrictions on conduct impermissible? Are they impermissible because\nthey pose a threat to \"individuality\"?\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n24.04J / 17.01J Justice\nSpring 2012\n\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

      "content": "JUSTICE\nLecture 8 - The Utility of Democracy\n1. So far:\n\na. We have considered the Principle of Utility as the ultimate principle of justice\n\nb. We have explored some of its implications for the content of laws and social practices\n\nc. But the Principle of Utility also has implications for the form of government\n\n2. Utilitarianism as a theory of democracy\n\na. Everyone should have rights of political participation, including the right to vote\n\nb. Not because there is an \"inalienable\" right to participate in collective decision-making\n\nc. But because popular government has \"the greatest amount of beneficial consequences\"\n\n3. Why does representative government have better results than non-representative government?\n\na. Influence on the content of laws: participation provides better protection against oppression\n\nb. Influence on the character of the governed: participation has important educative effects\n\n4. Mill on the beneficial educative effects of participation\n\na. Having the vote gives people the sense that the laws to which they are subject are\nchangeable by them, not merely \"visitations of Nature\" or unchangeable obstacles\n\nb. Political discussion expands people's thoughts beyond their daily tasks and wants; they are\nled to form opinions on larger matters of common concern\n\nc. Participation in the exercise of public functions (voting, serving on a jury, holding a public\noffice) develops the ability and desire to act impartially and to pursue the common good\n\n5. Government should be organized so as to enhance these beneficial educative effects, through e.g.:\n\na. Opportunities for ordinary citizens to participate in the exercise of public functions\n\nb. Norms of open, public discussion by government officials and elected representatives\n\nc. The Single Transferable Vote\n\n6. But mass participation can also have bad consequences, since at present the majority has\n\na. Low \"technical competence\"\n\nb. Low \"moral competence\"\n\n7. These \"dangers of incompetence\" must somehow be addressed if popular government is to be\njustified by appealing to its results\n\n8. Mill's proposal\n\na. No group should be permanently excluded from political participation: this would forgo\nthe beneficial educative consequences of participation\n\nb. But, a basic literacy and numeracy test should be required of all persons who wish to vote\n\nc. And, multiple votes should be given to persons of greater mental competence\n\n9. A potential objection to the utilitarian justification of democracy\n\na. It be wrong to give educated persons more votes even if doing so would have the best results\n\nb. Therefore, the utilitarian justification of democracy is defective\n\nc. And, the Principle of Utility itself must be mistaken\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n24.04J / 17.01J Justice\nSpring 2012\n\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

The minimal state is the most extensive state that can be justified\n\nb. Any state more extensive than the minimal state violates people's rights\n\n2. Nozick's argument against a more extensive, redistributive state\n\na. The typical justification for a redistributive state rests on some patterned principle\n\nb. But, patterned principles should be rejected, because\n\ni. \"liberty upsets patterns\"\n\nii. \"taxation of income from labor is on a par with forced labor\"\n\n3. Nozick's Entitlement Theory of distributive justice:\n\na. Nozick's Entitlement Theory is not patterned, but \"historical\": the justice of people's\nholdings - i.e., whether what people have, they have justly - \"depends upon what has\nactually happened\"\n\nb. The theory consists of three principles\n\ni. First principle specifies how unowned things can come to be owned justly\n\nii. Second principle specifies how (justly owned) things can be transferred justly\n\niii. Third principle says what to do about unjust acquisitions & unjust transfers\n\nc. According to the theory:\n\ni. A thing is owned justly if it was originally acquired justly & always transferred justly\n\nii. A person is \"entitled\" to the resources he or she possesses if and only if he or she\nacquired these resources through\n\n1. a just original acquisition (as specified by the first principle) OR\n\n2. a just transfer (as specified by the second principle) OR\n\n3. as compensation for previous injustice (as specified by the third principle)\n\niii. A given \"distribution\" of resources is just if everyone is entitled to the resources\nthey possess under the distribution\n\n4. Nozick on the (first) principle of just original acquisition:\n\na. How can one justly come to own a previously unowned thing?\n\ni. By \"mixing one's labor\" with it?\n\nii. By leaving \"enough and as good\" for others?\n\niii. By not making others worse off through one's act of appropriation\n\n5. Nozick on the (second) principle of just transfers:\n\na. A transfer of resources involving force or fraud is unjust\n\nb. Why? Because such a transfer violates a person's ownership of himself and his goods,\ninsofar as he no longer decides what he will do, or what will happen to his goods\n\n6. The (third) principle of rectification of injustice:\n\na. Applies to cases of unjust original acquisitions and cases of unjust transfers\n\nb. Asks what would have happened if the unjust acquisition/transfer had not occurred\n\nc. Calls for measures (e.g., restitution, compensation) that return the victim to the\ncondition in which he or she would have been if the injustice had not occurred\n\nd. But does not allow compensatory measures that would violate rights of unconnected\nthird-parties\n\n7. What are the implications of the Entitlement Theory for contemporary societies?\n\na. According to the Entitlement Theory, is the current distribution of property just?\n\nb. Does the current distribution reflect historical injustices that haven't yet been rectified?\n\ni. Who are the present-day victims of historical injustice? Who are its beneficiaries?\n\nii. Are the victims worse off than they would have been had the injustice not occurred?\n\nc. If there are as-yet uncompensated victims of historical injustice, what measures would\nbe sufficient to compensate them?\n\nd. Of these measures, which ones may the state use without violating the ownership rights\nof third parties (people who neither committed nor benefited from the injustice)?\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n24.04J / 17.01J Justice\nSpring 2012\n\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

Nozick's negative argument against extensive redistribution\n\nWILT CHAMBERLAIN: At t1, property is distributed according to a patterned\nprinciple, D1. en, a million people pay 25 cents each to watch Wilt Chamberlain\nplay basketball. At t2, Wilt is very rich; the distribution of property is D2.\n\nNozick argues that because D2 resulted from D1 plus a series of permissible transfers, D2\nis just. But since D2 is not D1, D1 must not be the only just distribution of holdings.\n\n2. Nozick's positive argument\n\nWILT CHAMBERLAIN is an example of (intuitively) j ust actions that \"patterned\" principles\ncan't account for. Nozick says that t he right theory of just holdings must recognize\nindividuals' rights to do what they want with what they (justly) o wn.\n\nA transfer is in accordance with the principle only if the parties enter the transaction\nvoluntarily, and there is no fraud or theft.\n\nNozick argues that any distribution of holdings is just, as long as the distribution comes\nabout from just original acquisition and a series of just transfers.\n\n3. Possible Objections (these are just a few ideas... use any or none of them in your paper!)\n\nObjection 1. Nozick says that his principle of Justice in Transfer is the right explanation of\nwhy WILT CHAMBERLAIN is just. Is his principle right?\n\n-Nozick says that a transfer is just if and only if the two parties act freely. But\nCohen argues that you can be forced to do something and do it freely.\n\n[Presentation question: explain why. What's an example of a transfer that is undertaken\nfreely, but is unjust?]\n\n-If that's right, we should replace Nozick's principle with something more\nrestricted.\n\n-Further question: what would be a better principle of just transfer? (We want one\nthat allows Wilt Chamberlain, but rules out the counterexample.)\n\nJUSTICE IN TRANSFER: \"A person who acquires a holding in accordance with the\nprinciple of justice in transfer, from someone else entitled to the holding, is entitled\nto the holding.\" (p. 151)\n\nObjection 2. Nozick says that the transfers in WILT CHAMBERLAIN are just because\neveryone owns their 25 cents, and so should have exclusive rights over it. Is that right?\n\n-Cohen argues that if everything is jointly owned, we never have exclusive rights\nover anything -\nwe always have some say over what others do with their property.\n\n-If Cohen is right, Nozick's Justice in Transfer principle will never apply; so it can't\nexplain what's going on in WILT CHAMBERLAIN.\n\nObjection 3. Nozick says that in WILT CHAMBERLAIN, D2 is just. Is it really?\n\n-Suppose everyone in the town where Wilt plays works in a mine. Wilt gets so rich\nthat he can afford to buy the mine. He does so, and fires all the workers. He then\noffers to hire them back for a much lower wage than before. Would that be just?\n\n-Further questions: Is there a difference between a case where Wilt gets very rich\nand a case where Wilt gets only slightly richer? What is the difference? When does\nit become unjust, if it ever does?\n\nObjection 4. Nozick says that in WILT CHAMBERLAIN, D2 breaks the pattern. Could we\nrelax our characterization of a \"pattern\", and come up with one that D2 doesn't violate?\n\n-Consider some distribution schemes that might still be in place after everyone\ngives Wilt a quarter. For example:\n\nNO STARVATION: If people are starving, redistribute holdings so that they\nare not starving. Otherwise, don't redistribute.\n\nNO MONOPOLIES: If a monopoly develops, redistribute to eliminate the\nmonopoly. Otherwise, don't redistribute.\n\nNO RACISM: If a distribution leaves a certain racial group significantly\npoorer than other groups, redistribute. Otherwise, don't redistribute.\n\n...etc.\n\n-ese principles say that we should only redistribute under certain conditions. So\nthey (probably) w\non't say that we should redistribute in Wilt's case.\n\n-If one of these schemes is the right \"patterned principle\", patterned principles could\naccount for individuals' rights to do what they want with what they own - at least in\nmost cases. ey will just place restriction on what end states are allowed.\n\n-Further question: what would Nozick say about these patterned principles?

      "content": "Justice\n\nTA: Sophie Horowitz\n4/6/2012\n\nSome motivations for Egalitarian Liberalism:\n1. A purely consequentialist conception of justice won't work; people's basic rights and liberties\nshould be protected.\n(Remember the Survival Lottery, or chopping up Ryan to redistribute his organs.)\n\n2. A purely historical conception of justice won't work; we need some constraints on the end state.\n-Resources shouldn't be distributed on the basis of arbitrary, morally irrelevant factors like\nrace, gender, sex, etc. - or even on the basis of natural talents or aptitudes. It should be fair.\n(Remember the sexist shopkeeper who only hires men.)\n\nRawls' two principles:\n\n1. Each person is to have an equal right to the most extensive scheme of equal\nbasic liberties compatible with a similar scheme for all.\n\n2. \"Social and economic inequalities\" are to be arranged so that they are:\n(a) attached to positions open to all under conditions of \"fair equality of\nopportunity\"\nand\n(b) to the greatest possible benefit of the least advantaged members of\nsociety (the \"Difference Principle\")\n\n-(1) g uarantees that we won't have survival lottery cases.\n-But (1) b y itself would allow discriminatory practices that systematically disadvantage certain\ngroups; (2a) p revents that.\n-And even with (1) a nd (2a), naturally talented people could still end up with a huge advantage,\nwhich Rawls thinks is unfair. (2b) p revents that.\n\nNote: e first principle takes \"lexical priority\" over the second. at means that the first principle\nmust be satisfied before we even worry about satisfying the second principle; there can't be\ntradeoffs between them. No inequalities are justified if the first principle is not satisfied.\n\ne Original Position and the Veil of Ignorance:\nIn addition to thinking his two principles are independently plausible, Rawls also gives another\nargument for them: he argues that these principles would be the result of a particular process that\nguarantees a just outcome.\n\nRawls' method:\nImagine that we are all rational agents in the \"original position\", behind the \"veil of\nignorance\". is means that we don't know what many things about ourselves: for\nexample, age, race, sex, physical abilities, mental abilities, religious values, and \"conception\nof the Good\". How would we agree to structure our society? Whatever principles we agree\non are the right principles of justice.\n\ne original position thought experiment is designed to do two things:\n\n(a) Ensure that the principles are ones that rational agents would all accept.\n(Rawls' view is a social contract theory; for him, society is something we enter into\nfor mutual benefit and it should be structured in a way that we can all agree to.)\n\n(b) Ensure that irrelevant factors don't influence the distribution.\n\nAccording to Rawls, his two principles are what we'd agree on from the original position.\n\nRawls thinks that the fact that this method yields plausible outcomes provides support for the\nmethod; the fact that a plausible method yields Rawls' principles provides support for Rawls'\nprinciples. e process of balancing the method and its outcomes against one another, and revising\neach in light of the other, is called \"reflective equilibrium\".\n\nQuestions to think about:\n1. Do Rawls' principles seem plausible on their own?\n\n2. Is Rawls' thought experiment a good way to determine the right principles?\n\n-Does the original position abstract away from the right features?\n-Does it abstract away from too much? How can we agree on anything when we know so\nlittle about ourselves?\n\n3. Would rational agents behind the veil of ignorance actually agree to Rawls' principles?\n\n-Why wouldn't they agree to maximize expected utility, for example?\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n24.04J / 17.01J Justice\n\nSpring 2012\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

We have also seen, in Rawls' theory, arguments for the\nclaim that certain arbitrary factors like race, sex, etc. shouldn't influence the distribution of\nholdings in society. is general thought s eems to be explained by:\n\nEQUAL OPPORTUNITY:\n\nHow well off we are shouldn't depend on factors outside our control.\n\nHere is another plausible idea: we should be held responsible for our decisions. Good\nchoices should be rewarded; bad choices should be punished. If you work hard, you deserve\nto prosper. If you commit a crime, you deserve to go to jail. is seems to be explained by:\n\nMORAL DESERT:\n\nHow well off we are should depend on how good our choices have been.\n\nQuestions:\n1. Are EQUAL OPPORTUNITY and MORAL DESERT mutually exclusive? What are some\nreasons to think that they can't both be true?\n\n2) If the two principles are incompatible, which one should we give up? Could we amend\none of them instead of giving it up entirely?\n\nRawls' Difference Principle\n\nRawls thinks that EQUAL OPPORTUNITY is not enough; if we just had EQUAL\nOPPORTUNITY, some members of society might still be very badly off. We also need:\n\nDIFFERENCE:\nInequalities in holdings are only just if they benefit the worst off.\n\nImagine two societies, X and Y. In both communities there is a job, engineering, that's\ndifficult and unpleasant to do, but rewards the whole community - and only the people\nwho work hard and succeed at school can do it. e engineers X are good-natured, and will\nwork hard at their jobs for an average salary. e engineers in Y are self-centered and will\nonly work hard at their jobs if they have a very high salary.\n\nAccording to DIFFERENCE, the engineers in X should receive an average salary while the\nengineers in Y should receive a very high salary.\n\nQuestions:\n1. Does this seem fair to you? Should the engineers in X get paid less just because they are\ngood-natured?\n\n2. Who deserves more money: the engineers in X, or those in Y?

But sometimes practices in\nprivate life can systematically make some group of people worse off than another group. So\nif we really care about fairness, arguably we should care about those practices just as we care\nabout the basic structures of society.\n\nExample from Okin: Women are systematically underrepresented in positions of\nwealth and power. Okin says this is caused by our current family structure - the\ndifferent roles mothers and fathers play; the different ways daughters and sons are\nraised, etc.\n\n1. Suppose Okin is right that the underrepresentation of women is caused by our current\n(typical) f amily structure. What should we do about it?\nA. Introduce stronger anti-discrimination laws, better parental leave policies, etc.?\n\nB. Suppose A doesn't work (remember Sweden - men and women get equal\nparental leave, but women tend to take it much more than men). Should the\ngovernment try to change the culture, through education, advertising, etc?\n\nC. Suppose B doesn't work. Should the government ban certain kinds of family\nstructures?\n\n2.
