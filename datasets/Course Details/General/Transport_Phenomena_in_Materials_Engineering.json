The first is coupling conservation and constitutive equations to give closed-form (partial) differential equation(s) in one or more field variables. The second is dimensional analysis, which identifies the key dimensionless parameters in a given problem and allows us to quickly characterize all of its possible solutions using as few parameters as possible. The mass transfer Biot number will be used to illustrate this process.\n\nHeat Conduction and Radiation\n\nThis section will take advantage of the mathematical similarity between diffusion and heat conduction to introduce you to a new phenomenon. Building on the principle of conservation of thermal energy, we will introduce new solutions to the (thermal) diffusion equation, define the heat transfer Biot number, and examine conduction in a solid with moving boundaries. Heat transfer by radiation will also be covered at some length, and coupled with conduction as a boundary condition. This section will close with an introduction to convection using a moving solid as an example.\n\nFluid Dynamics\n\nThis section will attempt to present Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluid dynamics using principles of conservation of mass and momentum in the same methodology as was used for diffusion and heat conduction. We will present the complete Navier-Stokes equations describing fluid flow, and use them to solve problems in which flow velocity varies in just one direction. The Reynolds number will be defined and related to the transition to turbulence. Boundary layer descriptions of flow near surfaces will be developed, and used to calculate the drag force on simple bodies moving relative to a fluid. Turbulence will be described qualitatively, and modeling methods based on Reynolds stresses will be developed and related to effective turbulent viscosity and eddy length scales. Finally we will discuss overall mass and momentum balances on large control volumes.\n\nHeat and Mass Transfer\n\nThis section will begin by applying the same large control volume methodology to thermal energy and species transport, and discuss batch/continuous reactor design in this context. It will then return to the Navier-Stokes equations, and their coupling with species diffusion and heat conduction to describe heat and mass transfer in fluids. We will calculate heat and mass transfer coefficients under steady laminar and turbulent flow conditions in simple geometries, driven both by external forces and thermal/solutal buoyancy, and discuss application to materials process engineering. At least four new dimensionless parameters will be introduced to describe all of the coupling phenomena involved.\n\nABET Statements for 3.185 (\nPDF\n)",

      "content": "p\n3.185 Problem Set 4\nIntroduction to Heat Transfer\nSolutions\n1. Thermal properties and optimal materials selection\n-k dT\n(a) The steady flux is given by Fourier's law: q =\ndx . If we have a hot body and a cold body at\ncertain temperatures and a certain distance apart, then dT is fixed, and we want to minimize k.\ndx\nTherefore, silica is by far the best choice.\n(b) We want a long timescale, so that the heat bursts are damped by the heat shield. Since the\ntimescale is L2 , we want to minimize α, and the best material is again silica.\nα\n(c) Here, we want short timescale, so we maximize α (and exclude diamond), giving us silver as the\noptimal material.\n(d) All we need to do is maximize heat energy per unit weight per degree, and the heat capacity cp\nmeasures just that. So, we maximize cp, which gives us aluminum as the material of choice. (Note\nJ\nthat in these units water has a heat capacity of 4184 kg·K , which is over four times better.)\n(e) We want to minimize ΔT for a given q. If we solve Fourier's 1st law for ΔT , we find it is equal\nto qΔx . With q and Δx fixed, minimizing ΔT means maximizing k, and the choice is diamond.\nk\n(f) Here, we want to maximize the flux for an unsteady problem. If we look at the erfc solution,\nwhich is valid for the time of initial contact between the molten metal and the rotating wheel, we\ny\nfind that T = Ti + (T0 - Ti)erfc\n√\nαt , where y is the distance from the wheel's outer surface. If\n-k dT\nwe evaluate the flux through the surface using q =\ndy , this gives us q = -k(T0 - Ti) √π\n.\n√\nαt\nk\nThe flux is proportional to √α , which is equal to\nkρcp. The nondiamond material with the\nlargest value of this parameter is copper. (Perhaps as diamond films fall in price they too will be\nused in this application.)\nCandidate materials:\nMaterial\nk, W\nm·K\nρ,\ng\ncm3\ncp,\nJ\nkg·K\naluminum\n2.7\ncopper\n8.96\ngold\n315.5\n19.3\nsilver\n10.5\ndiamond\n3.5\ngraphite\n2.25\nlime (CaO)\n15.5\n3.32\nsilica (SiO2)\n1.5\n2.32\nalumina (Al2O3)\n3.96\nα, cm\ns\n0.96\n1.14\n1.26\n1.73\n12.8\n0.225\n0.0623\n0.0094\n0.122\np\nW√s\nkρcp, m2 K\n·\n2.43 × 104\n3.71 × 104\n2.81 × 104\n3.23 × 104\n6.49 × 104\n1.00 × 104\n6.21 × 103\n1.55 × 103\n1.11 × 104\n\n2. Layered furnace wall and British units\nSet R1 to the inner radius and T1 to the temperature there, which equals the melt temperature of\n2000*F. Set the radius of the graphitebrick interface to R2, and the temperature there to T2 (not\ngiven). Set the outer radius of the brick later to R3, the outer brick temperature to T3 (also not given),\nand the environment temperature to T4 (70*F).\n(a) This is a sum of resistances problem, with the linear solution for the top and bottom given in\nclass:\nT1 - T4\nqz = L1 + L2 + 1\nk1\nk2\nh\nThe first material is graphite, L1 is 1.5 ft and k1 is 63 W\nK × 0.557 = 35.1 BTU ; for brick, L2 = 4\nm·\nhr·ft·* F\nBTU\nft and k2 = 16 hr·ft·* F ; h = 4\nBTU . So this gives us\nhr·ft2 ·* F\n1930*F\nBTU\nqz =\n= 3556\n0.543 hr·ft2 ·* F\nhr · ft2\nBTU\nThe area of the top and bottom are πR2, or 314 ft2 each, so twice this times the flux gives\n2.23 × 106 BTU .\nhr\nIn the radial direction, the equivalent is written in terms of Q, the fluxarea product:\n2πL(T1 - T4)\nQ =\n.\n1 ln R2 + 1 ln R3 +\nk1\nR1\nk2\nR2\nhR3\nWith our parameters, this gives us\n1.82 × 105ft ·* F = 4.69 × 106 BTU\nft·* F\nhr\n0.0388 hr·\nBTU\nAdding the power through the sides to that through the top and bottom gives a total power of\n6.92 × 106 BTU . You could convert the units using 1 BTU=1055 J, and 1 hr=3600 s, so the total\nhr\npower is 2030 kW (but you didn't have to).\n(b) By ignoring the corners, we treat them as perfect insulators. In a real furnace, they too would\nconduct heat away, so our power number is an underestimate.\n(c) We can just use the equation above with our known Q and a single layer at a time, e.g. for the\ngraphite layer:\n2πL(T1 - T2)\nQ =\n1 ln R2\nk1\nR1\nSolve for T2:\n\nQ\nk1 ln R2\nR1\nT2 = T1 -\n2πL\nFor our parameters and Q, we arrive at T2 = T1 - 198*F = 1802*F. Doing the same for the brick\nlayer gives T3 = T2 - 929*F = 873*F. Finally, the analogue for the outer heat transfer coefficient\nis\nQ\nT4 = T3 - 2πLhR3\nThis gives T4 = T3 - 803*F = 70*F, which is the outside temperature, as it should be.\n3. Polymer extrusion and thermal stress\n(a) The Biot number is given by:\nW\n0.01m\nBi = hR = 130 m2 ·K ·\n= 2.03\nk\nW\nm·K\n\n(b) For the Fourier number, we first convert z to time:\nz\nz\nuz = , so t =\nt\nuz\nFourier number definition:\nFo = αt\nR2 =\nkt\nρcpR2\nThe length scale here is the radius; this was shown on the graphs on pages 715-716 of W3C.\nDistance z\ntime t\nFourier number\n0.33 m\n1.0 m\n3.3 m\n3.3 s\n10 s\n33 s\n∼ 0.01\n∼ 0.03\n∼ 0.1\n(c) Since the Biot number is about 2, m = Bi-1 = 0.5, so we use the m = 0.5 curve in the graphs\nwith n = 0 (center) and n = 1 (surface), which give the dimensionless temperatures and real\ntemperatures as follows:\nDistance\nFourier number\nCenter T -Tf\nTi -Tf\nCenter T\nSurface T -Tf\nTi -Tf\nSurface T\n0.33 m\n1.0 m\n3.3 m\n0.01\n0.03\n0.10\n1.0\n1.0\n0.95\n160*C\n160*C\n∼ 155*C\n0.8\n0.7\n0.5\n∼ 135*C\n∼ 135*C\n100*C\nThe third of these, at z = 3.3m, obviously has the largest temperature difference.\n(d) This is a Biot number issue, since lower Biot numbers correspond to more uniformity in the solid.\nIndeed, for a Biot number below 0.1, we have a \"Newtonian cooling\" a.k.a. \"lumped parameter\"\nsituation where temperature is approximately uniform.\nTo reduce the Biot number hR , we can:\nk\n- use a different material with higher thermal conductivity k, though that would require, well,\nusing a different material, but we have orders for HDPE rods.\n- reduce the radius R, though that would require, well, reducing the radius, but we have orders\nfor 2 cm diameter rods.\n- reduce the heat transfer coefficient by turning off or slowing down some or all of the cooling\nfans, though this would require longer cooling time for the extruded rods, and therefore a\nlonger line in the factory or a slower production rate. Either way, the product will be more\ncostly, but that's better than shipping bad or outofspec product.\nIt's probably obvious that I was looking for the last of these three answers, but the question\nwording was vague enough that any of them would do.\nNote however that slowing down the line alone would not improve temperature uniformity, it\nwould just, well, slow down the line.\n4. Cooling of a little plastic widget\nNote that the ten seconds of free fall corresponds to 500 meters of height, so that part of the problem\nwas just a bit unrealistic. Oh well.\n(a) The Biot number is simply\nW\n0.005m\nBi = hL = 40 m2 ·K ·\n= 0.1.\nW\nk\n2.0 m·K\nThe Newtonian Cooling assumption therefore applies, with uniform temperature across the widget.\n\n!\n(b) The Fourier number is\nkt\nW\n10s\nFo = αt =\n=\n2.0 m·K ·\n= 0.356.\nJ\nL2\nρcpL2\n900 kg 2500 kg·K · (0.005m)2\nm ·\n(c) Because the Biot number is so small, the Newtonian cooling equation should apply; this equation\nis very accurate even for complex geometries like this one.\nAht\nT - Tfl = exp\nt\nTi - Tfl\n- V ρcp\nAht\nT = Tfl + (Ti - Tfl) exp - V ρcp\nW\n2 × 10-4m2 40\n10s\n·\nm2 K ·\nT = 20*C + (160*C - 20*C) exp -\n5 × 10-8m3 900 kg\n·\n2500 J\nm\nkg·K\n·\n3 ·\nT = 20*C + 140*C exp(-0.711) = 88.8*C\nThis temperature is the uniform temperature of the whole widget, and thus applies in the \"center\"\nand everywhere else.\n(d) The thermal conductivity does not enter into the Newtonian cooling equation in part 4c, so it\nwould appear that the final temperature would be unchanged.\nHowever, lowering the thermal conductivity increases the Biot number (since k is in the denom\ninator), which in part 4a was shown to be just at the Newtonian cooling threshold. The final\ntemperature in this case will thus be slightly higher than was predited in part 4c.\nThen again, a better estimate of the Biot number than in part 4a would use the volume/surface\narea ratio of 0.25 mm for L instead of the maximum dimension. In this case, the Biot number\nwould go from 0.005 to 0.01, still raising the center temperature, but only very slightly."

      "content": "3.185 Final Exam Overview\nComprehensive Coverage\nMonday December 8, 2002\nThe 3.185 final, which will take place on Monday December 15 in room 4149, will be comprehensive, covering\nall of the material in the subject, but with a focus on the last section. Part A will be closedbook and largely\nqualitative; when you turn it in you may open your books to work on Part B, which will be openbook,\nopennotes, openeverything (except other students), and focused on problem solving. Each part will be\nworth 100 points, and they will be designed to take the same amount of time. There may be an essay or\nother writing assignment.\nIn addition to the lists for the two midterm tests, you will be expected to know (i.e. memorize):\n1. Functional relationship for forced convection boundary layer thickness, friction factor and entrance\nδu\nlength: x = f1(Re), f = f2(Re), Le = f3(Re). You do not have to memorize the functions themselves.\nH\nu`\n2. Reynolds number in the smallest turbulent eddies: ν ∼ 1.\nν\n3. Prandtl number: heat transfer Pr = ν , mass transfer Pr = D .\nα\nνt\n4. Approximate turbulent Prandtl numbers: αt\nDt\n' νt ∼ 1.\nhx\n5. Nusselt number: heat transfer Nux = kfl , mass transfer Nux = hDx ; NuL variations.\nDfl\n6. Functional dependence of thermal (solutal) boundary layer thickness and Nusselt number in forced\nconvection: δT = f1(Rex, Pr), Nux = f2(Rex, Pr); same for NuL.\nx\n7. Functional dependence of Nusselt number in natural convection: Nux = f (Grx, Pr); same for NuL.\nYou need not memorize the Grashof number.\nu\n8. Velocity and streamlines: |~| ∝\n.\nstreamline spacing\n9. Bernoulli equation: along a streamline, K + P + ρgz = constant, or:\n10. Continuous flow reactors: Cout/Cin = f (kV /Q) (homogeneous) or f (kA/Q) (heterogeneous).\nYou can find example problems on the Bernoulli equation in the final exams from 2000 and 2002, which\nshould be on the old website; the 2000 and 2001 final exams also have sample problems on batch and\ncontinuous flow reactors.\nIn terms of length, I consider last year's final to be around the right length, though part B was quite difficult\n(particularly problem B1); in 2001, it was about the right length; in 2000, part A was a good length and\npart B a bit too long."

      "content": "~\n\n3.185 Test 1 Overview\nDiffusion and Heat Conduction\nFriday October 3, 2003\nThe first test, which will take place from Friday October 10 (first sitting during lecture time, in 2143)\nto ThursdayFriday October 1617 (second sitting in recitation), will include all of the diffusion material,\nand heat conduction through Newtonian Cooling. You will be allowed to use a calculator, and extra scratch\npaper will be provided if you need it.\nBetween the first and second sittings, you may consult with any resources you like, including other\nstudents, tutors, faculty, myself and the TA (though Albert and I will give you only conceptual answers,\nnot test question answers). We strongly encourage you to discuss the test material with other students, it\ncan make a large difference in your learning of the material and ability to demonstrate that learning in the\nsecond sitting. For the second sitting, you will be given your original scored answers, a new test booklet, and\na new answer booklet for questions you answered incorrectly the first time; you may not use other materials\nor consult with other students during the second sitting.\nYou will be expected to know (i.e. memorize):\n1. Fick's first law: J = -DrC\n∂C\n2. Conservation of species: ∂t =\nJ + G\n-r · ~\n∂C\n3. The \"diffusion equation\" for constant D: ∂t = Dr2C + G\n4. Its steadystate solution in 1D with no species generation: C = Ax + B\nx\n5. Its erf(c) solution in general form: C = A + Berf(c)\n√\nDt\n6. Firstorder chemical reaction boundary condition: Jn = ±k(C - Ceq)\n7. The (mass transfer) Biot number kL\nD\n8. Timescale for steadystate: tSS = L2/D\n9. The Buckingham pi theorem: n variables, r base units ⇒ i = n - r dimensionless parameters\n10. Fourier's first law: ~q = -krT\n∂T = αr2T + q\n11. The energy equation for constant k and ρcp: ∂t\nρcp\n12. Convective heat transfer boundary condition: qn = ±h(Ts - Tfl)\n13. The (heat transfer) Biot number: Bi = hL\nk\n14. Timescale for steadystate: tSS = L2/α\n15. The (heat transfer) Fourier number: Fo = αt/L2\nIf you need any equations beyond these to solve problems on the test, they will be provided on an Equation\nSheet handed out with the test, and if not there and not here, you may request additional equations during\nthe test which will be written on the board.\nYou should also be able to use a mass balance to derive the diffusion and energy conservation (i.e. heat\nconduction) equations in cylindrical or spherical coordinates.\nTests from the last years should give you several good practice problems. All of those materials are\navailable on last year's website; click on \"Assignments... solutions are available here\"."

As such, it reads\nvery poorly, but does contain all of the equations and derivations presented in the course.\nThis document is copyright 2003 by Adam Powell, and as part of MIT Open CourseWare (OCW), is li\ncensed in the same manner as other OCW documents (see http://ocw.mit.edu/global/termsofuse.html\nfor licensing terms).\n\nContents\n1 Introduction\n1.1 September 3, 2003 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n2 Diffusion\n2.1 September 5, 2003: 1D Cartesian and Cylindrical SteadyState . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n2.2 September 8, 2003: SteadyState with Homogeneous Chemical Reaction . . . . . . . . . . . .\n2.3 September 10, 2003: UnsteadyState Diffusion . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n2.4 September 12, 2003: 9/11 remembered, ABET . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n2.5 September 15, 2003: Wrapup unsteady, boundary conditions . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n2.6 September 17, 2003: Boundary conditions, layer growth . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n2.7 September 19, 2003: Layer Growth, Dimensional Analysis . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n3 Heat Conduction\n3.1 September 24, 2003: Wrap up dimensional analysis, start heat conduction . . . . . . . . . . .\n3.2 September 26, 2003: Heat conduction: boundary layers, multilayer wall . . . . . . . . . . . .\n3.3 September 29, 2003: Finally, the graphs! . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n3.4 October 1, 2003: Math Quiz, Graphs Wrapup, Newtonian Cooling . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n3.5 October 3, 2003: Moving on... . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n3.6 October 6, 2003: Finite Differences . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n3.7 October 8, 2003: More Finite Differences . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n3.8 October 15, 2003: Moving Body . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n3.9 October 17, 2003: Phase Change . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n3.10 October 20, 2003: Radiation . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n3.11 October 22, 2003: More Radiation . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n4 Fluid Dynamics\n4.1 October 24, 2003: Intro, Newtonian Fluids . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n4.2 October 27: Simple Newtonian Flows . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n4.3 October 29: 1D Laminar Newtonian Wrapup, Summary . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n4.4 October 31: Mechanics Analogy Revisited, Reynolds Number, Rheology . . . . . . . . . . . .\n4.5 November 3, 2003: NavierStokes Equations! . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n4.6 November 5, 2003: Using the NavierStokes Equations . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n4.7 November 7, 2003: Drag Force . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n4.8 November 12, 2003: Drag Force on a Sphere . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n4.9 November 14, 2003: Boundary Layers Part I . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n4.10 November 17, 2003: Boundary Layers Part II . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n4.11 November 21, 2003: Turbulence . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n4.12 November 24, 2003: Turbulence, cont'd . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n\n5 Coupled Fluids with Heat and Mass Transfer\n5.1 November 26, 2003: Coupled Fluids, Heat and Mass Transfer! . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n5.2 December 1, 2003: Nusselt Number, Heat and Mass Transfer Coefficients . . . . . . . . . . .\n5.3 December 3: Natural Convection . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n5.4 December 5: Wrapup Natural Convection . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n5.5 December 8: Wrapup Natural Convection, Streamfunction and Vorticity . . . . . . . . . . . .\n5.6 December 10, 2003: Bernoulli, Semester Wrapup . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n\nChapter 1\nIntroduction\n1.1\nSeptember 3, 2003\nHandouts: syllabus, ABET, Diffusion, PS1 due Monday 9/8.\nCirculate signup sheet: name, username, year, course\n- Introductions: me, Albert.\n- What is covered: review stuff on general overview. Lots of complexity: from single ODE to five\nfullycoupled nonlinear secondorder PDEs in five field variables.\n- Intro to the general transport methodology: conservation and constitutive equations\naccumulation = in - out + generation\n(1.1)\nDiscuss the \"terms\", with a flying eraser.\nMicroscopic and macroscopic.\n- Necessary for all classes of materials, ask how many are interested in each:\n- Polymers: synthesis, injection molding, membranes (Bo)\n- Bio: drug delivery, anisotropic diffusion, blood flow (cool)\n- Ceramics: powder synthesis, separation, drying, sintering\n- Electronic: crystal growth, CVD, diffusion\n- Metals: smelting, refining, casting, heat treatment\n- Why 3.185 is important: processing(structure)propertiesperformance. We do lowcost, highquality\nprocessing, low environment overhead, which is one of the two important aspects of this triad/tetrahedron.\nSponsors of our work care about two things: lowcost highquality processes and high performance.\nThey don't care about structure. Andy Groves, chairman of Intel, could care less about the electronic\nstructure of titanium silicidetitanium aluminide diffusion barriers in aluminum interconnects, he wants\ncheap highquality processes that result in high performance. Closer to home, parents' eyes glaze over\nat talk of \"Kinetics of eta phase precipitation in nickel superalloys,\" but not at \"Avoiding catastrophic\nfailure of jet engine turbine blades in service.\" Structure provides an important way to model the\nrelationship between processing and properties, without which a black box, not a science.\n\nZ\nZ\n\n+ ~\nMechanics\n- Discuss grading: HW points and collab, doublesession tests, mixed final.\n- Get test conflict dates, aim for Weds. 10/15-17, 11/19-21.\n- Make sure everyone has a recitation.\nSchedule office hours.\n-\n- Discuss travel: three trips, none of which should impact 3.185. If one more, tradition of having previous\nTA give a lecture.\nRequired math\n- Vector arithmetic (dot product, cross product, outer product)\n- Vector calculus (gradient, divergence, curl)\n- Solving homogeneous linear ordinary differential equations, e.g.\ny00 = k, or y00 -ky = 0\n(1.2)\n- What partial differential equations look like, e.g.\nr2C = 0\n(1.3)\nThe error function and derivatives:\n-\nx\ne-ξ2\nerf(x)\ndξ\n(1.4)\n=\n√π\nx\nd\nd\ne-ξ2\nerf(x)\ne-x\n(1.5)\ndξ = √π\n=\ndx √π\ndx\n- The substantial derivative: the time derivative in a moving frame.\nD\n∂\nDt = ∂t\nu · r\n(1.6)\nKind of like moving vector x(t), y(t), z(t):\ndC\ndx\n∂C\n∂C ∂x\n∂C ∂y\n∂C ∂z\n=\n+\n+\n+\n.\n(1.7)\n∂t\n∂x ∂t\n∂y ∂t\n∂z ∂t\n(x,y,z)\nPrevious feedback\n- Prof. Powell is cool, lectures are great, double tests are neat!\n- This course spent way too much time on diffusion. Okay, will cut a bit shorter this time. But non3.01s\nwill be lost, need to see TA or me.\n- Too much busy algebra on problem sets. Okay, will cut quite a bit, some computer.\n- Problem sets should be due on Friday instead of Monday, for lastminute recitation help. Poll class,\nincl. PS1 Mon or Weds?\n- Textbook is awful. It covers things in the wrong order, and is hard to read. Changing to new textbook,\nbetter readings, but still wrong order. Also see Incropera and DeWitt, in Reading Room; old text there\ntoo.\n\n- TLL: \"muddiest part\", index cards for each lecture from Friday, started last year, need more.\n- Too much online. But taking it off would only hurt those without Bibles. Sorry, won't do.\n- Prof. Powell lets \"dumb\" questions slow things down. No dumb questions. Very often correct mistakes\nor omissions, ten others have the same question. If anything, MIT juniors and seniors need to be much\nmore vocal! (Last midterm evaluation, dreadful lecture...)\n\nChapter 2\nDiffusion\n2.1\nSeptember 5, 2003: 1D Cartesian and Cylindrical Steady\nState\nTODO:\n- Check reading room to make sure texts are there.\n- Bring: cards, class list.\n- Check text to make sure chap 25 units are consistent with mine.\nOpener: Colleen's facility with names... my advisee!\nMechanics:\n- Diffusion handout typo: should be erfc(y) = 1-erf(y).\nChoose new recitation times!\n-\nFinalize test dates.\n-\n- Invite example processes.\n- Index cards for muddiest part.\n- Try names.\nDiffusion Stuff they've learned before, new twist. Steady state 1D cartesian, cylindrical coordinates.\nSteadystate: accumulation=0. In today's case, species isn't generated or consumed inside the glass, so\nin-out=0. (Monday: generation by homogeneous chemical reaction.)\n1D: concentration varies only in one direction.\nMy style: start with a motivating example, introduce the physics along the way. When we're done, we\nhave the physics, and an example of how to use it.\nYesterday: 3.185 is about lowcost highquality processes. Here a process, not for material but for helium,\nmaximize productivity a.k.a. throughput subject to process constraints.\nExample: helium diffusion through pyrex glass, enormously higher D than any other gas (25x hydro\ngen!). Some helium in natural gas, can flow through pyrex tubes to separate, 2mm OD 1mm ID. Generally\ndiffusionlimited. Want to calculate the production rate, more important understand how works, because\nfrom understanding flows design recommendations. ASSUME diffusionlimited, so this is the slowstep, not\nadsorption/desorption etc.\nSimple solution: unroll to a plate, with Cin on one side (equilibrium with partial pressure in natural gas)\nand Cout on the other (pumped away into tanks), be sure to use thickness δ. We know how to do this:\n\nConstitutive law: Fick's first, gradient points up, diffusion goes down, proportionality constant\nD:\n∂C\nJ~ = -DrC, Jx = -D\n(2.1)\n∂x\nUnits of each term.\n1D: no difference in y or zdirection, so those partials are zero. When varies in only one direction\nand not time, not partial but total dC/dx.\nConservation with no accumulation or generation: dJx/dx = 0, substitute to get\nd\ndC\nD\n= 0,\n(2.2)\ndx\ndx\nASSUME constant D this is\nd2C = 0.\n(2.3)\ndx2\nGeneral solution in 1D:\nC = Ax + B.\n(2.4)\nBoundary conditions (limited by diffusion):\nx = 0\nC = Cin, x = δ\nC = Cout.\n(2.5)\n⇒\n⇒\nResult: flux\nΔC\nJ = -DdC/dx = -D\n.\n(2.6)\nδ\ng\nAt 500*C, DHe-pyrex = 2 × 10-8 cm , for some steady gas/helium mixture Cin = 10-5\ncm3 ,\ns\nsay Cout ' 0. For δ = 0.5mm = 0.05cm, this gives\ng\n10-5\ncm\nJ = 2 × 10-8 cm2\n3 = 4 × 10-12\ng\n.\n(2.7)\ns · 0.05cm\ncm2 s\n·\nTube array with total length 10m=1000cm (e.g. 100 tubes each 10 cm long), R2 = OD/2 = 0.1cm,\nso throughput is\nJ A = 2πR2LJ = 8 × 10-10π = 2.5 × 10-9 g\n(2.8)\ns\nOr do we use R1? That would give 1.2 × 109 . How far off is the flux? A dilemma.\nTimescale: δ2 ' Dt ⇒ steady state. Here t ' δ2/D = 125000 seconds, about a day and a half.\nDesign: what to do to improve throughput?\n- Smaller δ: possible breakage\n- Higher D: change glass, raise temperature\n- Higher ΔC: raise/lower temperature, change glass\nOkay, that was the braindead 1D solution. What about the real cylinder?\nCylindrical coordinates So, Cout at outside, Cin at inside, what to do between? Use R1 and R2 for\ninner, outer radii. Fick's first, assume 1D, so C is function of r only.\ndC\nJr = -D\n(2.9)\ndr\nConservation: in at r + Δr, out at r, no gen or accum, area 2πrL:\n0 = [2πrLJr ]r - [2πrLJr ]r+Δr ,\n(2.10)\n\ndivide by 2πL, Δr → 0:\n0 = - d\ndr [rJr ]\n(2.11)\nPlug in flux:\n\n0 = d\ndr\nrD dC\ndr\n.\n(2.12)\nNow solve:\nA0\n= rD dC\ndr\n(2.13)\nA0\nDr\n=\ndC\ndr\n(2.14)\nC\n= A ln r + B\n(2.15)\nwhere A = A0/D. From BCs:\nC - Cin\nCout - Cin\n= ln(r/R1)\nln(R2/R1)\n(2.16)\nCheck at R1 and R2, units.\nFlux= -DdC/dr:\ndC\nJr = -D\n= -D d\nCin + (Cout - Cin) ln(r/R1)\n= DCin - Cout 1 .\n(2.17)\ndr\ndr\nln(R2/R1)\nln(R2/R1) r\nImportant result: not flux, but flux times area.\ndC\nAJr = -2πrLD\n= 2πrLDCin - Cout 1 .\n(2.18)\ndr\nln(R2/R1) r\nNote rs cancel, so AJr is constant for all r. Make sure units work. Cool.\nNumbers, result: 1.8×10-9 . Between the 1D estimates. Overestimated flux, at R2 is really 1.44 × 10-12 ,\ntwice that at R1, so R1 value is closer.\nMore important: cartesian gave wrong design criterion! Not minimize δ, but minimize R2/R1! Double\nproduction by going from 2 to\n√\n2 because ln(\n√\n2) = 1\n2 ln(2), e.g. 3 mm OD with no change in thickness!\nOther design issues: helium on inside or outside? Inside means glass is in tension, outside compression. But\nif gas is dirty, inside is easier to clean.\nNote: on problem set 2, will derive this for a sphere for a drug delivery device. Pretty cool.\n\n2.2\nSeptember 8, 2003: SteadyState with Homogeneous Chemi\ncal Reaction\nMechanics:\n- New recitations: R12, F2, both in 8306.\n- Fri: very different lecture, ABET stuff.\nNames.\nMuddy stuff:\n- Recitations. :)\n- Dislike cgs units.\n- Clearer writing and neater presentation. (Big chalk...)\n- Why both ways? One is simple but wrong, other is complex and right.\n- Flux in cylindrical coordinates. Give full gradient. (Next time.)\n- Integrating to get solution: d/dr(rdC/dr) = 0 ⇒ C = A0 ln r + B.\n- General-→ particular solution in cylindrical coords. Start with general, plug in BCs:\nCin\nCout\nCout - Cin\nA0\nCin\nB\nC\nC - Cin\nC - Cin\nCout - Cin\nC = A ln r + B\n= A0 ln R1 + B\n= A0 ln R2 + B\n= A0(ln R2 - ln R1)\nCout - Cin\n=\nln(R2/R1)\nCout - Cin\n=\nln R1 + B\nln(R2/R1)\nCout - Cin\n= Cin - ln(R2/R1) ln R1\nCout - Cin ln r + Cin -\n=\nln(R2/R1)\nCout - Cin\n=\nln(R2/R1) ln(r/R1)\nln(r/R1)\n=\nln(R1/R2)\n(2.19)\n(2.20)\n(2.21)\n(2.22)\n(2.23)\n(2.24)\n(2.25)\nCout - Cin\nln(R2/R1) ln R1\n(2.26)\n(2.27)\n(2.28)\n- Didn't finish: timescale to steadystate τ ∼ L2/D, in this case 125,000 seconds, about a day and a\nhalf. Will explore this more rigorously on Friday.\nSummarize: illustrates 3.185 methodology\n- Problem statement: maximize throughput = flux× area\n- Conservation equation\n- Constitutive equation\n- Combine to give (partial) differential equation\n\np\nq\n- General solution with integration constants\n- Boundary conditions give values of integration constants\n- Use solution to get problem objective: flux×area\n- Design recommendation follows from solution\nLike p. 465 of W3R.\nGeneration Homogeneous chemical reactions. RCC carbon fiberreinforced graphite composite! Very\nhightemperature, highstrength. Carbon fiber preform, model as a porous material, diffusion of acetylene\nto the surfaces of the fibers, at high temp it decomposes and deposits graphite.\nProblem: as it deposits, it seals off the entrances, nonconstant diffusivity. Generation of acetylene G = -kC.\nUNITS!\nSet up problem in center, symmetry, sheet of material. 1D equation:\nd2C\nd2C\n0 = D dx2 + G = D dx2 - kC\n(2.29)\nGeneral solution, using polynomials eRx , R = ± k/D, so\nr\n!\n\nr\n!\nk\nk\nC = A exp x\n+ B exp -x\n(2.30)\nD\nD\nBCs: at x = ± L C\n,\n= C0, so A = B,\n\"\n\nr\n!\n\nr\n!#\n\nr\n!\nL\nk\nL\nk\nL\nk\nC0 = A exp\n+ exp - 2\nD\n= A cosh\n(2.31)\nD\nD\nResult:\nq\ncosh x\nC\nk\nD\n=\nq\n(2.32)\nC0\ncosh\nk\nD\nL\nD\n, or more generally, L2\nor VERY nonuniform, uniform if that number is small (thin sheet, slow reaction, fast diffusion), nonuniform\nif it's large (thick sheet, fast reaction, slow diffusion). Makes sense.\nSo, have process, want to double thickness with same uniformity, can't change D much, how much change\nk? Drop by factor of 4. Problem: takes four times as long!!\nThe real solution: blow acetylene through it!\nWhat does this look like? Pay attention to\nk\nL\nk . Can either be sorta uniform,\nD\n\n2.3\nSeptember 10, 2003: UnsteadyState Diffusion\nTODO:\n- Check reading room to make sure texts are there.\n- Bring: cards, class list.\n- Check W3R pages for this lecture.\nNAMES!\nMechanics:\n- Get office hours together.\n- Pump the zephyr instance.\n- Fri: very different lecture, ABET stuff.\nMuddy stuff:\n- Cylindrical gradient (W3R appendices AB, p. 695-700):\n∂C\nrC =\nrˆ + 1 ∂C θˆ+ dC z,\n(2.33)\nˆ\n∂r\nr ∂θ\ndz\n∂2C\n1 ∂C\n1 ∂2C\n∂2C\n=\n+\n+\n(2.34)\nr2C\n∂r2\nr ∂r\nr2 ∂θ2 + ∂z2 , or\n∂2C\n∂2C\n∂\n∂C\n(2.35)\n=\nr\n+ r2 ∂θ2 + ∂z2 , or\nr ∂r\n∂r\n(2.36)\n- During derivations, important points are obscured. \"What we've learned\" summaries help. Basi\ncally following outline mentioned before, on p. 465 of W3R. Also feel free to snooop around Athena\ndirectory...\n- How to draw exponentials in concentration profile?\n- Plotting hyperbolic trig functions--necessary? No. If needed, use calc/table.\n- Too quick jump from integ consts to carbon fiber material, missed lots.\n- Keep C2H2 conc constant for constant rate? Not quite, keep it uniform.\n- How to calculate C2H2 consumption rate? Use concentration (or partial pressure) and reaction con\nstant. But often don't know reaction constant, need to try at various temperatures, or just do what\nwe did--find something which works, and use this methodology to understand why and how to make\nwork for new designs.\n- How do we get:\ndC\ndC\nd2C\nx -\ndx\ndx x+Δx\nlim\nΔx→\n+ G?\n(2.37)\n+ G = D\n0 -D\nΔx\ndx2\nDerivative of the derivative is the second derivative?\n- Arrhenius plot: which part is diffusionlimited, which part reactionlimited? Can't really compare\nbecause of different units. But can sort of make a plot of log(kL2/D) vs. 1/T , look at different\nparts. Want: lowtemperature reactionlimited case, with fast diffusion to wipe out conc gradients.\nDiffusionlimited means it doesn't diffuse in very far.\nNext Monday: reaction and diffusion in series, which dominates is more straightforward, can easily\ncompare the different coefficient.\n\np\np\n\n- How did\nk/DL/2 become kL2/D? What's important for design: if two designs have the same kL2/D,\nthen have the same\nk/DL/2, same uniformity. So use the simpler one to guide design decisions. Get\ninto further with dimensional analysis next week.\n- Why no flux at x = 0? Because of symmetry: on left, flux goes right; on right, flux goes left; in middle,\nflux goes... nowhere! Symmetry, or zeroflux boundary condition, like PS2 #3.\nUnsteady Diffusion Last two times: stories to take home: increasing production rate of helium from\nnatural gas, highquality manufacturing of reinforced carboncarbon for space shuttle wing, nose leading\nedge tiles. This time: math first, examples later, because three different solutions to the diffusion equation,\nexamples can use one or more.\nNow accumulation != 0, rate also in mol/sec = V ∂C/∂t. Chapter 27 material. Resulting equation in\n1D:\n∂C\n∂2C\n= D\n+ G.\n(2.38)\n∂t\n∂x2\nPhysical intuition: concentration curvature is either due to generation, or leads to time evolution, or both.\nUpward curvature means neighbors diffuse in, either G negative or C increases; downward means diffuse out,\neither G positive or C decreases.\nToday focus on zerogeneration solutions which you've seen before, to be used in this class (book derives\nthem using Laplace transforms...):\nError function:\n-\nx\nC\n= Aerf(c)\n+ B,\n(2.39)\n√\nDt\n∂C\nx\nx2\n∂t\n= -\n√\nπDt3 exp -4DT\n,\n(2.40)\n∂C\nx\n∂x\n=\n√π 2\n√\nDt\nexp -4DT\n,\n(2.41)\n∂2C\n2x\nx\n=\nexp\n∂x2\n-√\nπDt 4Dt\n-4DT\n(2.42)\nx\nx\n= -\n√\nπD3t3 exp -4DT\n.\n(2.43)\nSo this satisfies equation 2.38.\nWhat it looks like: graph erf, erfc; discuss constant C BC x = 0\nC = C0, uniform C IC t = 0\n⇒\n⇒\nC = Ci. Results:\nx\nCi > Cs ⇒C = Cs + (Ci -Cs)erf\n√\nDt\n(2.44)\nx\nCs > Ci ⇒C = Ci + (Cs -Ci)erfc\n√\nDt\n(2.45)\nSemiinfinite. But what if your part is not semiinfinite, but thickness L? (Not many parts are semi\nL\ninfinite...) Since erf(2)=0.995 and erfc(2)=0.005, we can approximate inf' 2, if 2\n√\nDt > 2, then erf is\nabout 1 and erfc about 0, can consider semiinfinite. Solve for t:\nL2\nt < 16D ⇒semi -infinite.\n(2.46)\n(Recall t > L2/D ⇒steadystate...)\n\n- \"Shrinking Gaussian\":\nAδ\nx2\nC\n=\nexp - 4Dt\n+ B\n(2.47)\n√\nπDt\n∂C\n= ...\n(2.48)\n∂t\nGraph: initial layer of height A + B in background of B, spreads out.

Note onesided, twosided; either way, BC at\nx = 0 ⇒ ∂C/∂x = 0.\nNot necessarily square initial condition! Can even start with erf, drive in to shr Gaussian.\n\n2.4\nSeptember 12, 2003: 9/11 remembered, ABET\nTODO: Bring ABET handout!\nSchedule office hours.\nSeptember 11. The day meant a lot of things to a lot of people. Yesterday the occasion was commemorated\nin a number of ways, here in Boston, in my hometown of New York City, and around the country and the\nworld. I can't hope to be as profound as some of the speakers at those services, but can talk about a few\nthings it meant to me personally, in particular as I have reflected on my decision to become an engineer,\nand my purpose in the profession. Perhaps some of it will resonate with one or two of you; I invite your\ncomments or questions, and we'll take as long for this as we have to.\nI'd like to start nine days before the tragedy, when I was in New York for my sisterinlaw's wedding. My\nwife's parents live in Brooklyn, which is where the ceremony was held, but we were staying with her aunt\nand uncle in Long Island. At least twice a day in the few days beforehand, we drove the Belt Parkway and\nBrooklynQueens Expressway, wrapping around Brooklyn, passing under the Verazzano bridge and entering\nNew York Harbor, with the view of the Statue of Liberty and the majestic buildings rising ahead, the skyline\ndominated, of course, by the World Trade Center.\nDuring those drives, I recalled the experience of my High School French teacher Mr. Schwartzbart, an\nAustrian Jew who survived World War II in a rural Belgian boys' camp which, unknown to him at the\ntime, was made up entirely of Jewish boys, and in fact, was set up to keep them safe throughout the Nazi\noccupation. He described the terror he felt under the occupation, and then the arrival of the American\nsoldiers, \"All of them giants,\" he said, then pointed to me, \"like Adam,\" they had come to set the continent\nfree.\nAnd he described the journey to America as a young teenager, a transforming experience. Most amazing\nwas the entry of his ship carrying scores of poor immigrants like himself into New York Harbor, this impossibly\nenormous bridge which just got bigger and bigger as they approached (the Verazzano was the longest span\nin the world for about 50 years), the tranquility of the harbor within, with the great buildings visible\nahead including the Empire State, and the Statue of Liberty to his left as they steamed toward Ellis Island\n(the World Trade Center's construction was still 20 years away). There was an aweinspiring sense of the\nmagnitude of this great nation of impossible size which had overwhelmed some of the greatest evil the world\nhad ever known, and his heart swelled with joy at the thought that there was such power on the side of\nliberty.\nThese days in is fashionable to reflexively cringe at the identification of this country with freedom,\nand this teacher in particular very frequently commented cynically on the deficiencies in American culture\nand education. Having come to know this side of him, when we asked why he came to this country, Mr.\nSchwartzbart's reply surprised us: \"The land of the free and the home of the brave.\" Then after a pause,\n\"It really is true.\" His personal experience of this gave great weight to these words.\nDuring these drives along the Belt Parkway, my thoughts also turned toward the fragility of the grand\nedifices, and in particular to the 1993 bombing of the underground parking lot of one of the Twin Towers.\nFortunately the towers withstood that attempt to destroy them, but there would surely be more attempts,\nand no amount of devastation was too horrible for the perpetrators to dream up. Should anything happen, I\nwas grateful for the opportunity to see this beauty, and even to feel a small piece of what Paul Schwartzbart\nhad felt some fifty years earlier. I thought of how fortunate is his generation which came through the\nDepression, fought that terrible war, and lived to see the nation preside over such a long and prosperous\npeacetime as the world had perhaps never before known.\nSo you can imagine my shock when just nine days later, as I sat in my office, my wife called from home\nto say that while watching CNN, they announced that a plane had crashed into the World Trade Center.\nWell, I thought, about 60 years ago a small plane hit the Empire State building, I'm sure there was a lot\nof damage and many people killed, but the rest of the building should be fine. Just a few minutes later\nshe called again to tell me about the second plane, and suddenly I was afraid. Then the Pentagon, and the\nmissing plane in Pennsylvania. My thoughts turned to the MidEast, and this administration's policy of\ndeliberate neglect in the IsraeliPalestinian peace process. Then the last call, one tower had collapsed. With\nher voice choking from the tears, she described its fall as \"like a house of cards,\" and could say little more.\n\nImmediately, I logged out, got on my bike, and pedaled home as fast as I could.\nI'm sure each of us can tell a story about where we were when it happened. Being from New York, I was\nimmediately concerned for friends and family. My wife's grandmother went to the roof of her building in\nQueens, from where she saw the second plane hit the south tower, and that tower's collapse. I had shared\nthis view every day growing up as I rode the Roosevelt Island tramway to school and saw these buildings\nwhich seemed as permanent as mountains. My wife's best friend in College, who lives in the Prospect Heights\nsection of Brooklyn and works in the southern tip of Manhattan, noticed people in his neighborhood looking\nup and saw some smoke, but rushed into the subway as he was late for work; the packed subway stopped\nafter it left Brooklyn and waited in the tunnel for about 20 minutes before it turned back and he got out\nand learned what had happened. My Elementary School best friend worked in the 17th floor of Tower 1,\nand had a bad back which would have made it painful and difficult to get out--if he hadn't been home sick\nthat day.\nThen there was my father's friend whom I know well and whose business had just finished moving into\nthe 89th floor of Tower 1. His staff had been told not to come in that morning until 10 AM, because their\ncarpets, freshly washed during the 17 AM shift, would need to finish drying. As he drove north on the New\nJersey Turnpike, he saw the first plane crash right through the windows of his new office, then took the next\nexit and went right back to his daughter's kindergarten class.\nThe previous Spring and Summer I had a course 6 UROP student in my group. His brother worked\nabove the 90th floor of Tower 2, and on the first and second day afterward without a word to anyone in his\nfamily, my student grew panicked, then desparate, then increasingly hopeless. His brother finally called to\nsay that a friend had literally dragged him from the office after the first plane hit, and they ran out of the\nbuilding together just as the second plane smashed into it. He described bits of the hell that was the area\naround him, but at the time had no other thought than to get away, go home and lie down in shock, not\neven thinking about his relatives who were trying to reach him. My student described the moment when\nthey connected as one of the happiest of his life.\nAnother friend was not so fortunate. Her father worked in an upper floor of Tower 2, and was one of\njust two in his company who didn't make it out. To make matters worse, she was trapped in L.A. because\nof grounded planes, unable to get back and try to locate him, so day upon day she was not only uncertain\nand hurting but frustrated at being far from anyone who could help her. She is still grieving, as it's hard to\naccept that she lost the closest person to her in the world because a handful of maniacs decided to crash a\nplane into his building.\nThere are of course tens of thousands more stories like these, so many people were affected directly or\nknew someone who was. But even if you were not so directly involved, if you're like me, the tragedy didn't\nend on that day, but played out over and over again in your mind. I can't count how many mornings in the\nensuing months I woke up at 3 AM thinking about the towers' collapse, feeling hurt, afraid, angry, and much\nas I hate to admit it, somewhat vindictive as we learned of the total destruction of the Al Queda camps and\ncave complexes in Afghanistan.\nThen thoughts turned to my own life. What can I do, what's my role in the world, how can I help?\nI turned to the motivations I had for entering science and engineering, and materials science in particular,\nwhich I came up with in High School. Motivations for studying these things vary greatly, from interest in\nthe subject matter, elegance of the equations, beauty of nature etc., to being able to earn a stable income\nand support a household, or perhaps a large income, to serving society in some way. My own motivations\nfell somewhat in the first category, but if I had followed that alone I would have been 63 (computer science);\nit was the last of these categories, serving society, which steered me into Materials Science.\nAs a high school student, I verbalized this service as follows. As a scientist or engineer, I would be helping\nto solve the world's little problems, which I listed as:\n- Agriculture, to feed a growing planet.\n- Medicine, allowing people to lead longer, healthier lives.\n- Transportation and communications, to bring people together and lessen the chances of conflict. For\nexample, much of the reason war between France and Germany today is unthinkable is because there\nare so many more personal crossborder relationships now than in 1940 or 1914, it's very difficult for a\npropagandist to castigate an entire people as \"the enemy\" and it's becoming more difficult every year.\n\n- Human interactions with the environment, for sustainable living.\n- A recent addition, information access, with implications for democracy, as the biggest enemy of an\nauthoritarian state is the truth.\nAll of these are important in themselves, but even more important, if we do our jobs well and make a\ndifference in these areas, we help the artists, politicians, economists, philosophers and theologians to solve\nthe big problems, which I would list as:\n- World peace.\n- Averting famines, and their relief. Almost all famines can be avoided without resort to international\naid, and are the result of poor resource management or hoarding.\n- Real public health, made available to those who need it around the world.\n- Justice, including somewhat equitable economic distribution.\n- Truth in journalism and history.\n- Human happiness and fulfillment.\n- Purpose and meaning for our lives.\n- Artistic expression of emotions, of values, of that purpose and meaning.\n- Last year Ross Benson added: Tolerance of differences.\nAn important consequence of this understanding of \"little problems\" and \"big problems\" is that being a\nscientist or engineer requires a lot of faith, faith that our knowledge and our inventions will be used wisely,\nfor good and not for evil. The more \"sciencey\" our contributions, the more faith is necessary, with the\nultimate example perhaps being nuclear science, which can be used to produce lots of cheap power or cure\ndiseases, or destroy entire cities in an instant. If we work on weapons, they can of course be used for defense\nor for aggression.\nBut even if we're not working on nuclear science or weaponry, one of the lessons of September 11 for me\nis that no matter how careful we are to focus on purely nonmilitary technologies, this tragedy showed that\neven a civilian jetliner--built to bring people together--can be abused by people with sufficient hatred as a\nweapon of mass destruction. This is truly frightening for us, and requires us to have that much more faith\nin the people, institutions and systems surrounding the technology in whose development we participate.\nSo what should we do? Shall we abandon technology altogether and go back to rubbing sticks together?\nPerhaps we should join the peace corps? For some of us that will be the answer, but I think there's a lot\nmore that can be done with the little problems that can help to make a real impact on the big ones. So how\ncan we put ourselves in positions to do as much good as possible?\nI can think of a few ways, but at your age and even at mine, perhaps the most important is to take a\nstep back and examine what we're doing and why. I have an advisee taking this class now who took off all\nof last Spring for that very purpose, and ended up returning to MIT (and in fact to Materials Science) that\nmuch more focused than the previous December for the experience. Of course, you don't have to take off a\nsemester to do this, there are very good ways to do some of this right here.\nFirst, the HASS and HASSD subjects present outstanding opportunities for this kind of exploration.\nMIT is no longer just about training technology leaders, but also about training world leaders who know\nabout technology, and this school has put enormous resources into building world class departments in the\nHumanities, Arts and Social Sciences. For example, I've heard tremendous things about our Anthropology\ndepartment from a variety of external sources, and even within our department we offer a HASS subject\ncalled Materials in the Human Experience (3.094) every Spring.\nSecond, I've made a point of suggesting to all of my advisees that they get to know the MISTI programs\n(I think that stands for MIT Internships in Science, Technology and Industry), which do an outstanding job\nnot just of sending students to companies, universities and government labs in foreign countries, but also\npreparing them for the trip, even culturally and psychologically.\n\nThird, develop a habit of using your wealth to support organizations and causes which effectively promote\nwhat you view as positive values. You may not have much now, but you will later, and getting into this habit\nis not hard; furthermore, membership in many of these organizations requires a contribution of as little as\n$30. If you like I can discuss offline some of the organizations I've given to since my undergraduate years,\none even since high school.\nFourth, look for opportunities to participate in the process of improving lives yourselves. Whether\ntutoring or mentoring, or working in a social justice organization, or writing to Congress, participating\nin society in a meaningful way is important to making it all work, and I believe important to improving\nourselves too. Believe it or not, time is actually one resource which you will not have more of later in life\nthan you have now, particularly if children become part of your life.\nFifth and perhaps most importantly, get to know your fellow students. This buzzword is repeated over\nand over again, but it's worth repeating yet again: because MIT attracts the best and brightest from all over\nthe world, the diversity of the students on this campus is truly extraordinary, it's almost certainly broader\nand deeper than anything you've experienced before college, and almost certainly broader and deeper than\nanything you will ever experience later in life. That goes for Cambridge as well, and many other universities,\nthough much less so on the graduate level and beyond. And by getting to know your colleagues, I don't just\nmean hanging out and eating pizza, nor even getting to know what spices they use to cook lamb, though\nfood is of course an important part of social interaction. I'd encourage you to learn something about your\nfriends' lives, their families, their values--and be willing to discuss these aspects of yourselves too.\nAnd given its importance, I'd encourage you to learn something about your friends' faith. Human\ninstitutions, organizations, systems and even nations are terrific, but never perfect, as we learned in a\npowerful way on September 11. Participating in and strengthening them is an important and honorable\nactivity, but I believe that placing all of our hope on them is not viable in the long term. At some point\nthey're going to let us down, as this country has in some ways let down my French teacher Mr. Schwartzbart.\nFurthermore, evidence abounds for forces at work in the universe beyond those of physics, and even grows\nwith the increase of human knowledge about this universe; perhaps the most significant example is the\nAnthropic Principle in Cosmology, which some of you may have heard of and I'd be happy to discuss offline.\nThat concludes what I said last year: the tragedy reminds us that our work here is very important, but\nmust be viewed in context, and done with faith that it will be used for the broad purposes for which we\nintend it. Since last year, time has passed and some of the emotions have subsided just a bit, also several\nimportant things have happened, or have not happened, causing my own feelings about this to be somewhat\nmore complicated.\nFor one thing, the message from Washington continues to urge us to live out lives as if nothing had\nhappened, because if we changed anything, we'd be giving the terrorists what they want. But this is\nfoolishness, important things have changed, and as citizens there are things we can do on a daily basis to\nimprove our country's security, and the silence from Washington has been deafening.\nA few months ago I saw a book provocatively titled, \"When you ride alone, you ride with bin Laden.\"\nThe cover art was derived from a World War II poster, \"When you ride alone, you ride with Hitler,\" whose\npoint was that the practices of avoiding driving, carpooling, and using public transportation save gasoline\nneeded for the war effort. In that vein, an important thing which has not happened is that there has been no\neffort whatsoever on a national level to reduce our dependence on imported oil, which has been a huge factor\nin our problems in the Middle East. In fact, we've seen the opposite in this administration's rollback in fuel\neconomy standards, and heard talk about the costs to the auto manufacturers and consumers of requiring\nincreases in efficiency, with no mention whatsoever of the multitude of costs of continuing to burn fossil fuels\nas extravegantly as we like.\nAnother thing which has changed my view of the world was the war in Iraq. For months, the administra\ntion hyped any evidence at all for Iraqi connections to Al Qaeda and possession or development of weapons\nof mass destruction. Then inspections were allowed (to be fair, largely due to U.S. pressure, and no thanks\nto the posturing of certain countries like France), and onebyone the inspections eliminated every piece of\npurported WMD evidence save the rumor about uranium purchase from Niger. And so with that one rumor\nas justification, we sent an invasion force to Kuwait, and used technological superiority to destroy the Iraqi\narmy in about four weeks.\nI believe that the war was wrong for a number of reasons. First, as mentioned, it was completely\n\nunjustified. There was no correlation to terrorism, none to weapons of mass destruction, and there are a\ndozen dictators around the world whose human rights violations could similarly motivate action. If violation\nof U.N. resolutions was the motive, then it's up to the U.N. to act.\nSecond, this war was an extremely imprudent waste of resources. It is unwise to spend a couple of hundred\nbillion dollars on a flimsilyjustified war in a time of record deficits, and even more imprudent to tie down\nfifteen of the U.S. Army's thirtythree combat brigades in that occupation during a time of multiple threats\nfrom WMD in North Korea and Iran, to shaky stability in Afghanistan, to lowlevel al Qaeda activity from\nIndonesia to Somalia. And most significant is the loss of hundreds of American and thousands of Iraqi lives,\nvery nearly including that of my own brother, a Captain in the U.S. Army third infantry division's second\nbrigade, whose unit was hit by an Iraqi missile just after their capture of downtown Baghdad. Like my\nCourse 6 UROP student two years ago, the days between learning of the attack and confirming my brother's\nsafety were some of the longest of my life. I cannot imagine the terror and grief of hundreds of thousands of\nloved ones of Iraqi soldiers who did not know for weeks or months whether their sons, brothers, husbands or\nfathers were dead or alive, nor the pain of those whose worst fears were in the end confirmed.\nFinally, the war has cost us diplomatically, and will continue to cost us potentially for many genera\ntions. The arrogance with which the administration shrugged off overwhelming international opposition was\nshocking, prticularly as it involved three of the five Security Council permanent members, some of our most\nimportant allies, and both of our neighbors. Even more shocking was the pathetically childish pettiness with\nwhich the administration spoke of \"punishing\" the opponents to the war--particularly the French--and then\nturned around to ask them to contribute money and troops to the occupation and reconstruction to reduce\nthe resource burden on us. But in the long term, the most diplomatically destructive aspect of the war is\nthe precedent it sets for accusing a nation of violations of one sort or another, putting aside international\noutcry for restraint, and using military superiority to crush the weaker victim. This precedent can easily\nbe abused by, say, Turkey, Syria, Egypt, Jordan and Saudi Arabia against Israel, North Korea against the\nSouth, Russia against the former Soviet Republics, China against Taiwan--any nation with a fight to pick\ncan say, \"But of course it's been done before, by the Land of the Free and Home of the Brave!\"\nAnd so we are reminded of our duty as citizens to speak out about matters of importance to our country.\nAnd in particular, as scientists and engineers we have the duty to speak out with authority on certain issues\nsuch as the small cost of reducing energy consumption, and the enormous costs of not doing so. Most of\nall, in the changed world our need for faith is greater than ever, in our work as well as our outlook for the\nfuture. I welcome any comments, contributions, or questions.\nABET Sheet Review See the ABET sheet.\nUnsteady Diffusion Continued Muddy stuff:\n- Symbol conventions: Ci is initial, C0 I use as surface and sometimes other things; Cs always surface\nconcentration.\n- Physical meaning of graphs, interpretation of these things: coming soon.\nExact criteria for each solution: will be summarized.\n-\n- Semiinfinite and erf validity. First, semiinfinite applies to onesided erf and onesided shrinking\nGaussian. Fully infinite applies to twosided both.

Apologies to those affected, particularly language.\nForms a strong part of 9/11 feelings, particularly as administration has done its best to tie them\ntogether. Uncomfortable with talking about one side and not the other. War must always be a last\nresort when other means e.g. negotiation have been tried. Defining objectives as narrowly as \"regime\nchange\" with neither aggression nor clear and present danger (Bush and Clinton) is as misguided and\nwrong as extremists in the region who call for destrurction of a certain state \"by any means necessary\".\nOpen for last words...\nContinuing where we left off last time (did the erf and shrinking Gaussian):\nFourier Series:\n-\nC\n= a exp(-b2Dt) sin(bx)(or cos),\n(2.55)\n∂C\n= -ab2D exp(-b2Dt) sin(bx),\n(2.56)\n∂t\n∂C\n= ab exp(-b2Dt) cos(bx),\n(2.57)\n∂x\n∂2C\n= -ab2 exp(-b2Dt) sin(bx).\n(2.58)\n∂x2\n(2.59)\nElegant and simple.

Note linearity of diffusion equation: any sum of solutions is also a\nsolution. So we can add sine waves to get something more useful, use that.\nFourier transform: express any initial condition as sum of sine waves. We'll do one: square wave of\nperiod 2L for multilayer material annealing, each term has period 2L/n so bn = nπ/L:\ninf\n\nX\nn2π2Dt\nnπx\nC =\nan exp -\nL2\nsin\n.\n(2.61)\nL\nn=0\nThe Fourier transform:\nan =\n, n odd, 0, n even.\n(2.62)\nnπ\nIllustrate different sine functions, how they add to a square wave.

Graph\namplitude vs. time, show n = 3 drops out nine times faster, n = 5 twentyfive times faster. Do it as\nt/τ , where τ = L2/π2D, so first term is exp(-t/τ ), second exp(-9t/τ ). One term remains real fast.\nConsider: t = L2/D...

Added to lecture notes, in my home directory.\nDiffusion boundary conditions Types:\nConstant C: what's that C?\n-\n- Constant flux: sealed means zero, sometimes ion beams, etc. (not often)\n- Flux vs. C, for chemical reaction or mass transfer coefficient. J = k(C - Ceq ) (note ChemEs' k00...)\nUnits: k in cm/s. Also mass transfer coefficient through fluid film: J = hD (C - Ceq ), where hD = δ/D.\nExample: gas diffusion in metal. Oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen in metals: diffuses monoatomically,\n2O(m) ⇔ O2(g), equation:\npO2 .\n(2.66)\nKeq = [O]\nSo oxygen concentration at equilibrium is proportional to the square root of pressure. (Not the same for\nhelium, argon, etc.) Then if flux is proportional to difference in concentrations, it's proportional to square\nroot of difference in partial pressures!\nMisconception 1: Equilibrium is NOT steadystate. Global equilibrium here would be a brick of SiO2. Local\nequilibrium gives concentrations at interface sometimes. Can be out of local equilibrium and at steady state\ntoo.\nMisconception 2: kinetic reaction rate order is NOT thermodynamic order.\nLayer growth Motivating example: silicon oxidation (example W3R pp. 487489). Electronic components,\nthis is the \"gate oxide\" in MOSFETs, draw pnp structure. Thickness must be tightly controlled for the\nFET to work--to switch at the right voltage. How to make the oxide? Expose it to air, and it just grows.\nCool. Wet oxidation too: expose it to steam and it grows differently (slower?). How much does it grow, how\nlong to leave it there?\nGo to the phase diagram, this one is pretty simple. Start with equilibrium. Many times, can use the\nphase diagram. Others, with impure phases (like air), or partial pressure or total pressure dependency, need\nactivity to get equilibrium concentration at interface.\nOut of equilibrium, but interfaces at local equilibrium: diffusionlimited, explain the concept of pseudo\nsteadystate. Growth is really slow because, although D might be high leading to steadystate, C3 - C1 is\nreally small, leading to slow flux, really slow growth of the layer.

The steadystate equation reduces\nto:\n∂2ux\n0 = μ\n+ Fx\n∂z2\nFxz2\nux = - 2μ + Az + B\n\nBCs: zero velocity at bottom plate at z = 0, free surface with zero shear stress at z = L, Fx = ρgx =\nρg sin θ, result: B=0, get\nux = g sin θ (2Lz - z 2)\n2ν\nShear stress:\n\n∂ux\n∂uz\nτzx = -μ\n+\n= ρg sin θ(L - z)\n∂z\n∂x\nThis is the weight of the fluid per unit area on top of this layer!\nShear stress as the mechanism of momentum flux, each layer pushes on the layer next to it.

For erfs, they can start at 0, or somewhere else (zinc\ndiffusion couple), and go \"forward\" or \"backward\". Graph the normal way. Also:\nux = U 1 + erf\nz - L\n√\nνt\n- Weight of fluid: consider layer of fluid from z to L, it has force in x and zdirections Fg = V ρg sin θ\nand - cos θ respectively. In xdirection, shear goes the other way: Fτ = -τzxA. So force balance for\nsteadystate (no acceleration):\nV\nV ρg sin θ - Aτzx = 0 ⇒ τzx =\nρg sin θ = (L - z)ρg sin θ.\nA\nIn zdirection, this is balanced by pressure:\nP = Patm + ρg cos θ(L - z).\nNice segue into pressuredriven flows. Suppose fluid in a cylinder, a pipe for example of length L and radius\nR, P1 on one end, P2 on other. Net force: (P1-P2)Axs, force per unit volume is (P1-P2)V/Axs = (P1-P2)/L.\nCan shrink to shorter length, at a given point, force per unit volume is ΔP/Δz → ∂P/∂z.

For part b, think about what\nhappens to glasses as they cool...\n- In problem 5, think about conduction through a multilayer wall, in terms of the interface condition.\nAlso, just as the multilayer wall has two layers with different values of A and B in the temperature\ngraph T=Ax+B, here we have two fluid layers with different values of A and B in the falling film\nsolution given in class (that solution is the answer to part a). The Reynolds number will be discussed\nin tomorrow's lecture.\nMuddy from last time:\nCrossbar on z.\n-\nP1 -P2\n- Why is A = 0, B =\n4μL R2 in tube? General solution:\nP1 - P2\nuz = - 4μL r 2 + A ln r + B,\nboundary conditions: r = 0\nuz not infinite, r = R\nuz = 0. So, nonzero A in A ln r gives infinite\n→\n→\nuz at r = 0, use B to exactly cancel first term at r = R.\nNote: at axis of symmetry, ∂uz /∂r = 0, like temperature and conc; this too would give A = 0.\n- Mechanics analogy: very rushed, deserves better treatment, even though not a part of this class.\nReynolds number Like other dimensionless numbers, a ratio, this time of convective/diffusive momentum\ntransfer, a.k.a. inertial/viscous forces.

Water modeling...\n- Air: 10-5N · s/m2, density 1.9kg/m3, kinematic viscosity (momentum diffusivity) 5 × 10-6m2/s, close\nto water!\nBut, very different effect on surroundings, drag force. So even though might flow similarly over a hill,\ngeologists can tell the difference between water and wind erosion damage.\nLiquids: generally inverse Arrhenius; gases (forgot).\nNonNewtonian: graphs of τyx vs. ∂ux/∂y. Categories:\n- Dilatant (shearthickening), example: fluid with highaspect ratio solid bits; blood. More mixing,\nmomentum mixing, acts like viscosity. Platelet diffusivity, concentration near walls...\nModel: powerlaw, n > 1.\n- Pseudoplastic (shearthinning), examples: heavilyloaded semisolid, many polymers get oriented then\nshear more easily.\nModel: power law, n < 1.\nNext time: Wierd shearthinning behavior at low strain rates due to fibrinogen content, extremely\nsensitive to fibrinogen and measures risk of cardiovascular disease better than smoking! (Gordon\nLowe)\n- Bingham plastic: finite yield stress, beyond that moves okay, but up to it nothing. Some heavilyloaded\nliquids, polymer composites, toothpaste; semisolid metals bond together then break free.\nModel: yield stress τ0, slope μP .\nPower law relation:\n\nn\n∂ux\nτyx = μ0\n∂y\nMore than 1D leads to wierd Tresca, von Mises criteria, etc.\n\n~\n4.5\nNovember 3, 2003: NavierStokes Equations!\nMechanics:\n- Weds 11/5: 3B Symposium!\nPS7 material last on Test 2... Due next Weds.\n-\n- Today: midterm course evaluations!\nMuddy from last time:\n- In fluids, is τ a shear or normal stress? Equating it to σ is confusing... It's a shear stress. It might\nhave \"normal\" components, but if you rotate it right, it's all shear.\n- What's the difference between a liquid and a Newtonian fluid? Liquids are fluids, as are gases, and\nplasmas. Definition: finite (nonzero) shear strain rate for small stresses. Bingham plastic not tech\nnically a fluid, nor in a sense is a strict powerlaw pseudoplastic (though tends to break down near\n0).\nThe NavierStokes equations! Pinnacle of complexity and abstraction in this course. From here, we\nexplain, we see more examples, we fill in more details. Probably last time without a motivating process...\nSo don't be surprised if you don't understand all of this just now, it's a bunch of math but should be clearer\nas we go on.\n3.21 \"Are you ready for momentum convection?\"\nConservation of mass 2D NavierStokes: two equations for three unknowns!

If axisymmetric and flow is mostly θ, then can use this as \"fullydeveloped\".\nEdge effects: flow direction, large variation direction, third direction is \"edge\" direction. For tube flow,\nwas θ, so axisymm is equiv to \"no edge effects\". For rodcup, will be something else.\nDrag force Integrated traction (force per unit area) in one direction. For tubes, it's in the zdirection,\nuse the shear traction (stress) times area: Fd = τ · A. Here, looking at τrz :\n∂uz\nuz = P1 - P2 (R2 - r 2) ⇒ τrz = -μ\n= P1 - P2 r.\n4μL\n∂r\n2L\nFd = 2πRL · τrz r=R = 2πRLP1 - P2 R = πR2(P1 - P2).\n|\n2L\nNeat result: this is just the net pressure force.

In terms of uav :\numax\nuav =\n= (P1 - P2)R2\n,\n8μL\n\n(P1 - P2)R2\nFd =\n8πμL = 8πμLuav .\n8μL\n·\nFor any laminar flow, this is the drag force. Drag is shear traction times area:\nFd\n8πμLuav = 4μ\n8μ\nFd = τrz · 2πRL\nτrz = 2πRL =\n2πRL\nR uav =\nuav .\n⇒\nd\nOkay, using uav to correlate with flow rate whether laminar or turbulent. So what about turbulent?\nDensity plays a role because of convective terms. Dimensional analysis:\nτ = f (U, μ, d, ρ)\nFive parameters, three base units, so two dimensionless parameters. Four different nondimensionalizations!\nKeep\nπτ\nπother\nτ\nτ , μ\nρU 2\nπμ =\nμ\nρU d\nτ d\nπρ = ρU d\nτ , ρ\nμU\nμ\nτ d2 ρ\nπU = ρU d\nτ , U\nμ\nμ\nτ\nπd = ρU d\nτ , d\nρU 2\nμ\nFirst and last are essentially the same, though last is more familiar (Reynolds number), so ignore the first.\nThird is just a mess, so throw it out. Second is a great fit to what's above. So use last, or second?\nWith turbulence, there are different curves with different surface roughnesses, roughly proportional to\nU 2 . If use second, get one flat πτ laminar, multiple lines for turbulent πτ . If use first/last, one line for\nlaminar, multiple flats for turbulance (p. 188). So this is generally more convenient.\nDimensionless πτ is called (fanning) friction factor f (ff ). The denominator 2 ρU 2 is the approximate\nkinetic energy density, we'll call it K, a.k.a. dynamic pressure. So:\nτ\nτ = f K, Fd = f KA, f = 1\n= f (Re).\nρU 2\nLaminar flow friction factor:\nτ\n=\nd\nμ uav\n16μ = 16\nf =\n=\n1 ρU 2\n1 ρU 2\nρU d\nRe .\nTo calculate drag force: Reynolds number (and surface roughness) → friction factor f\nτ = f K, Fd = f KA.\n→\n\n4.8\nNovember 12, 2003: Drag Force on a Sphere\nMechanics:\n- Test 2 11/19 in 2143, preview handout today.\n- PS7 extended to Friday.\nMuddy from last time:\n- How is f = 16μ/ρU d?\n8μ\nτrz\n16μ = 16\nτrz =\nuav\nf = 1\n= 8μuav /d = ρuav d\nRe .\nd\n⇒\nρu2\nρu2\nav\nav\n- What's the point of defining f ? We just need τ , right? Well, f is easy for laminar flow, for turbulence\nit's more complicated. This gives us a parameter to relate to the Reynolds number for calculating drag\nforce in more general situations. More examples on the way.\nˆ\n- Or was it ~t, not f ? In that case, traction ~t =\nn, force per unit area. In this case, with n = rˆ,\nσ ·\n~t = (τrr + p, τrθ , τrz ). The relevant one for the zdirection is τrz , but traction is more general, see an\nexample later today.\n- Why was option #4 the \"better\" graph?

Mystery of the universe:\nhow does liquid Ti sit in contact with solid Cu? Main purpose: removal of hard TiN inclusions often several\nmilimeters across which nucleate cracks and bring down airplanes! (1983 Sioux City, Iowa.)\nSet up problem: sphere going one way usphere, fluid other way uinf, local disturbance but relative velocity\nU = uinf - usphere, relative veloc of fluid in sphere frame. Drag force is in this direction.\nFor a sphere, drag force is slightly different: it has not only shear, but pressure component as well.\nˆ\nTraction ~t = σ · n. Stokes flow: ingore the convective terms, result (pp. 6871):\nFd = 3πμdurel.\nAt high velocity, similar friction factor concept to tube:\nFd = f KA = f · ρU 2\nπd2 .\n· 4\nAgain, f (Re), but not really πτ because τ is all over the place, more of an average. This time, low Re (<0.1)\nmeans Stokes flow, can ignore all convective terms; analytical result in 3.21 notes, drag force:\nFd = 3πμU d = f · ρU 2\nπd2 ⇒ f = 24μ = 24 .\n· 4\nρU d\nRe\n\nIf faster, though not turbulent, f becomes a constant. Graph on W3R p. 153 of f (they call cD ) vs. Re.\nConstant: about 0.44, that's what I've known as the drag coefficient. Cars as low as 0.17, flat disk just\nabout 1, making dynamic pressure a good estimate of pressure difference.\nFor rising/sinking particles, set drag force to buoyancy force, solve for velocity. If not Stokes flow, you're\nin trouble, way to do it but it's complicated.\nCan NOT use this for bubbles. For those, Fd = 2πμUd all the way out to Re=105!\nSo, what about precipitation? Buoyancy force and weight vs. drag force, all sum to zero:\nFw = πd3ρsphere, Fb = πd3ρf luid, Fd = what we just calculated.\nAfter all, if you're not part of the solution, you're part of the precipitate.

For a phenomenon that is literally\nubiquitous, remarkably little of a quantitative nature is known about it. Richard Feynman, the\ngreat Nobel Prizewinning physicist, called turbulence \"the most important problem of classical\nphysics.\" Its difficulty was wittily expressed in 1932 by the British physicist Horace Lamb, who,\nin an address to the British Association for the Advancement of Science, reportedly said, \"I am\nan old man now, and when I die and go to heaven there are two matters on which I hope for\nenlightenment. One is quantum electrodynamics, and the other is the turbulent motion of fluids.\nAnd about the former I am rather optimistic.\"\n\nr\nThat article goes on to talk about direct numerical simulation of all of the details of turbulent flows, of\nwhich I am not a great fan. Why? as pointed out in my JOM article \"3D or not 3D\", even if computers\ncontinue to double in computational power every eighteen months, the fifthpower scaling of complexity with\nlengthscale in three dimensions (cubic in space times quadratic in time) means that the resolution of these\nsimulations will double only every sevenandahalf years!\nTo take a simple illustrative example, direct numerical simulation of turbulence in continuous casting\ninvolves Reynolds numbers on the order of one million, and the smallest eddies are a fraction of a millimeter\nacross and form and decay in a few milliseconds. One must account for interaction with the free surface,\nincluding mold powder melting and entrainment, as well as mold oscillation, and surface roughness of the\nsolidifying metal, since with turbulent flow, the details of these boundary conditions can make a large\ndifference in macroscopic behavior. The formulation alone is daunting, and computational work required to\nsolve all of the equations on each of the tens of trillions of grid points over the millions of timesteps required\nto approach steadystate will be prohibitively costly for many years, perhaps until long after Moore's law\nhas been laid to rest (indeed, the roughly four petabytes of memory required to just store a single timestep\nwould cost about two billion dollars at the time this is being written). Furthermore, postprocessing that\nmany degrees of freedom would not only be computationally difficult, but it is not clear that our minds\nwould be able to comprehend the resulting complexity in any useful way, and further, the exercise would\nbe largely pointless, as one really cares only about coarsegrained averages of flow behavior, and detailed\nbehavior perhaps at certain interfaces.\nAnalysis: for 1 m flow through the nozzle 0.1 m in diameter, with kinematic viscosity of .005/7000' 10-6\ns\nm , this gives us Red ' 105 . Using the larger lengthscale H of the caster, around 1 m, this gives ReH ' 106 ,\ns\nthis is given in the paragraph above. Using standard enengy cascade/Kolmogorov microscale analysis, the\nenergy dissipation rate for the largest turbulent eddies in a tube is given by\n\nU\n,\n∼ μt\nd\nwhere μt is the turbulent viscosity, U the eddy velocity estimated by the average velocity, and d the eddy\nsize estimated by the tube diameter. Combining this with the wellknown Kolmogorov result for the smallest\neddy lengthscale `:\ns\nμ3\n` ∼\nρ2\n(ρ is density) gives the smallest eddy lengthscale as\nμ .\n` ∼ d √Red\nμt\nEven using the conservative estimate of μt = 30μ gives ` ∼ 0.1 mm, in 1 meter cubed this gives a trillion\ngrid points, but you want a few grid points across each smallest eddy which means about a few3 ' 100 times\nmore grid points, hence \"tens of trillions\".\nPut slightly differently, the total rate of energy dissipated in a jet at steadystate is the rate of kinetic\nenergy input, which is the product of volumetric kinetic energy given by dynamic pressure and the flow rate:\nπ\nV = ρU 2 π d2U =\nρU 3d2\n· 4\nm\nTaking the volume as 1 m3, average velocity of 1 s , nozzle diameter of 0.1 m and density of 7000 kg gives\nm\n' 30 W Putting this into the Kolmogorov lengthscale expression again gives ` ∼ 0.1 mm.\n3 .\nm\n\nr\nr\n\n4.12\nNovember 24, 2003: Turbulence, cont'd\nMechanics:\n- Turbulence movie: QC151.T8; guide QC145.2.F5 Barker Media.\nMuddy from last time:\n- Difference between uav and Uinf?

Largest eddy Re=U L/ν, smallest eddy Reynolds number\nu`/ν ∼ 1. Energy dissipation, W/m3; in smallest eddies:\n\ndu\nu\n= η\ndx\n∼ η `2\nAssuming most energy dissipation happens there, we can solve these two equations, get smallest eddy size\nand velocity from viscosity, density and dissipation:\n\nρ`2\n\nu ∼ `\nη ⇒ η\nη ∼ 1\nη3\n` ∼\nρ2\nThis defines the turbulent microscale. For thermal or diffusive mixing, turbulence can mix things down\nto this scale, then molecular diffusion or heat conduction has to do the rest. Time to diffusive mixing in\nturbulence is approximately this `2/D.\nSo suppose we turn off the power, then what happens? Smallest eddies go away fast, then larger ones,\nuntil the whole flow stops. Timescale of smallest is `2/ν, largest is L2/νt, turbulent effective viscosity.

They are: the real velocity, the timesmoothed component of\nvelocity, and the fluctuating component of velocity.\n- What timescale can you find from the lengthscale of the smallest eddies? How would one go about this?\nTwo timescales are relevant here: one is diffusion timescale `2/D, which gives mixing time, and the\ntimescale of formation and elimination of these little eddies `2/ν. When attempting direct numerical\nsimulation of turbulence, this tells how small a timestep one will need (actually, a fraction of this for\naccuracy); this also describes how long the eddies will last after the mixing power is turned off.\nThermal and solutal boundary layers Types: forced, natural convection; forced today, natural later.\nRecall first BL thought experiment on thick polymer sheet extrusion, hot polymer sheet T\nand cold\ninf\nwater Ts.

Here:\nδC /δu or δT /δu = 0.72Pr-1/2 .\nPhysical meaning: grows as sqrt of diffusivity, so ratio is ratio of square roots of diffusivity, which is\ninverse sqrt(Pr).\n- Case 2: smaller thermal(/concentration) boundary layer (Pr>5 or so): consider T/C BL to have linear\nvelocity, smaller velocity means thicker T/C BL. Here:\nδC /δu or δT /δu = 0.975Pr-1/3 .\n- Moving on, back to case 1, calculated q|y=0 from erf solution:\nU\nqy = k(Ts - Tinf)\ninf = hx(Ts - Tinf) ⇒ hx =\nkρcpUinf .\n√π\nαx\nπx\nLikewise for mass transfer:\nr\nDU\nhDx =\ninf .\nπx\nSince that's the local, let's integrate for average, neglecting edge effects:\nZ L\nqav =\nhx(Ts - Tinf)W dx = hL(Ts - Tinf)\nW L\nx=0\nL\n2(Ts - Tinf) q\nkρcpUinfx/π\n= hL(Ts - Tinf)\nL\nx=0\nhL = 2\nkρcpUinf = 2hx|x=L\nπL\nNow for case 2 (highPrandtl), need different formulation.

Can also fill in the table...\nConditions:\n- No shear or other losses (not nearly fullydeveloped)\n- No interaction with internal solids, etc.\n- No heat in or out, mechanical work on fluid (pumps, etc.)\n- No sudden expansion (jet-→ turbulent dissipation, separation complicates stuff)\nNo turbulence\n-\n- No combustion (mixing-→ effective viscosity)\nYes sudden contraction.\n-\nNote timetodrain problem on final of three years ago (that was the \"derive and solve a new equation\"\nproblem of 2000), tendency for diff eqs and thought problems...\n\nSemester summary You've come a very long way! Mentioned linear to multiple nonlinear PDEs, un\nderstanding of solution. More generally, learned to start with a simple conservation relation: accum = in\nout + gen, turn into really powerful results, on macro or micro scale, for diffusion, thermal energy, mass,\nmomentum, even kinetic energy.\nCovered all topics in fluid dynamics and heat and mass transfer, in MechE, ChemE, aeroastro. If want\nto go on, take graduate advanced fluid dynamics or heat/mass transfer, will be bored in undergrad class.\nAlso done some computation; for more depth with or without programming experience, try 22.00J/3.021J!\n(Shameless plug...)\nThank Albert for a terrific job as a TA!\nLast muddy questions\n- What is the relevance of the boundary layer thickness to the Bernoulli equation? The boundary layer\nis a region where there is quite a bit of shear, and sometimes turbulence. If it is thin relative to the size\nof the problem (e.g. relative to the diameter of the tube), then most of the fluid will have negligible\nshear.\n- Why such a wierd coordinate system in Bernoulli example 2? Why not just make z = 0 at the bottom\nof the tube? You could do that too, and it would work equally well, it just differs by a constant in the\npotential energy; the way we did it is just more consistent with the first example:\nPoint\nKE\nP\nPE\n∼ 0\npatm\nρg(h1 + h2)\n∼ 0\npatm + ρgh1\nρgh2\nρg(h1 + h2)\npatm - ρgh2\nρgh2\nρg(h1 + h2)\npatm\nBatch and Continuous Flow Reactors For those interested.\nBasic definitions, motivating examples. Economics: batch better for flexibility, continuous for quality\nand no setup time (always on).\nTwo types: volumetric and surface reactors. Volume V, generation due to chemical reaction; we'll discuss\nfirstorder A -→ B, so\nG = - kCA\nFor a volume batch reactor, start with CA,in, dump into reactor, it goes:\naccum = generation\ndCA\nV\n= - V kCA\ndt\nln(CA) = - kt + A\nCA,out = exp (- kt)\nCA,in\nFor mass transferlimited surface batch reactor, say\naccum = out\ndCA,out\nV\n= - AhdCA\ndt\nCA,out\nhD A\n= exp\nt\nCA,in\n- V\nTwo extremes in continuous reactor behavior with flow rate Q: plug flow and perfect mixing.\n\nPlug flow is like a minibatch with tR = V/Q, draw plug in a pipe, derive:\nCA,out\nkV\n= exp\nCA,in\n- Q\nWith a surface, the V s cancel, left with\nCA,out\nhD A\n= exp\nCA,in\n- Q\nPerfect mixing: in, out, gen, no accum, out at CA,out reactor conc:\n0 = QCA,in - QCA,out - kV CA,out\nCA,out =\nQ\n=\nCA,in\nQ + kV\n1 + kV\nQ\nWith area:\nCA,out =\nCA,in\n1 + hD A\nQ\nSay target conversion is 0.01, given volume V , homogeneous with constant k.\nBatch:\n-\n4.6\ntR =\nln(CA,in/CA,out) =\nk\nk\nprodection rate is\nV\nkV\n=\n4.6\nk + tchange\n4.6 + ktchange\n- Plug:\nkV\nkV\nQ =\n=\nln(CA,in/CA,out)\n4.6\nBetter than batch, likely better quality too, less flexible.\n- Perfect mixing:\nkV\nkV\nQ =\n=\nCA,in/CA,out - 1\nMuch smaller than either of the others!\nDead zones and effective volumes!\nHow to tell: tracers, Peclet number.\nOther examples: catalytic combustion (that dimensional analysis problem in PS3), alveoli/breathing\n(continuous/batch mixed). Batch: generally better conversion in same volume (see why); continuous: con\nsistent quality, no setup time.\nSteelmaking: batch, but folk want to make continuous."

We do lowcost, highquality\nprocessing, low environment overhead, which is one of the two important aspects of this triad/tetrahedron.\nSponsors of our work care about two things: lowcost highquality processes and high performance.\nThey don't care about structure. Andy Groves, chairman of Intel, could care less about the electronic\nstructure of titanium silicidetitanium aluminide diffusion barriers in aluminum interconnects, he wants\ncheap highquality processes that result in high performance. Closer to home, parents' eyes glaze over\nat talk of \"Kinetics of eta phase precipitation in nickel superalloys,\" but not at \"Avoiding catastrophic\nfailure of jet engine turbine blades in service.\" Structure provides an important way to model the\nrelationship between processing and properties, without which a black box, not a science.\n\nZ\nZ\n\n+ ~\nMechanics\n- Discuss grading: HW points and collab, doublesession tests, mixed final.\n- Get test conflict dates, aim for Weds. 10/15-17, 11/19-21.\n- Make sure everyone has a recitation.\nSchedule office hours.\n-\n- Discuss travel: three trips, none of which should impact 3.185.

      "content": "Chapter 2\nDiffusion\n2.1\nSeptember 5, 2003: 1D Cartesian and Cylindrical Steady\nState\nTODO:\n- Check reading room to make sure texts are there.\n- Bring: cards, class list.\n- Check text to make sure chap 25 units are consistent with mine.\nOpener: Colleen's facility with names... my advisee!\nMechanics:\n- Diffusion handout typo: should be erfc(y) = 1-erf(y).\nChoose new recitation times!\n-\nFinalize test dates.\n-\n- Invite example processes.\n- Index cards for muddiest part.\n- Try names.\nDiffusion Stuff they've learned before, new twist. Steady state 1D cartesian, cylindrical coordinates.\nSteadystate: accumulation=0. In today's case, species isn't generated or consumed inside the glass, so\nin-out=0. (Monday: generation by homogeneous chemical reaction.)\n1D: concentration varies only in one direction.\nMy style: start with a motivating example, introduce the physics along the way. When we're done, we\nhave the physics, and an example of how to use it.\nYesterday: 3.185 is about lowcost highquality processes. Here a process, not for material but for helium,\nmaximize productivity a.k.a. throughput subject to process constraints.\nExample: helium diffusion through pyrex glass, enormously higher D than any other gas (25x hydro\ngen!). Some helium in natural gas, can flow through pyrex tubes to separate, 2mm OD 1mm ID. Generally\ndiffusionlimited. Want to calculate the production rate, more important understand how works, because\nfrom understanding flows design recommendations. ASSUME diffusionlimited, so this is the slowstep, not\nadsorption/desorption etc.\nSimple solution: unroll to a plate, with Cin on one side (equilibrium with partial pressure in natural gas)\nand Cout on the other (pumped away into tanks), be sure to use thickness δ. We know how to do this:\n\nConstitutive law: Fick's first, gradient points up, diffusion goes down, proportionality constant\nD:\n∂C\nJ~ = -DrC, Jx = -D\n(2.1)\n∂x\nUnits of each term.\n1D: no difference in y or zdirection, so those partials are zero. When varies in only one direction\nand not time, not partial but total dC/dx.\nConservation with no accumulation or generation: dJx/dx = 0, substitute to get\nd\ndC\nD\n= 0,\n(2.2)\ndx\ndx\nASSUME constant D this is\nd2C = 0.\n(2.3)\ndx2\nGeneral solution in 1D:\nC = Ax + B.\n(2.4)\nBoundary conditions (limited by diffusion):\nx = 0\nC = Cin, x = δ\nC = Cout.\n(2.5)\n⇒\n⇒\nResult: flux\nΔC\nJ = -DdC/dx = -D\n.\n(2.6)\nδ\ng\nAt 500*C, DHe-pyrex = 2 × 10-8 cm , for some steady gas/helium mixture Cin = 10-5\ncm3 ,\ns\nsay Cout ' 0. For δ = 0.5mm = 0.05cm, this gives\ng\n10-5\ncm\nJ = 2 × 10-8 cm2\n3 = 4 × 10-12\ng\n.\n(2.7)\ns · 0.05cm\ncm2 s\n·\nTube array with total length 10m=1000cm (e.g. 100 tubes each 10 cm long), R2 = OD/2 = 0.1cm,\nso throughput is\nJ A = 2πR2LJ = 8 × 10-10π = 2.5 × 10-9 g\n(2.8)\ns\nOr do we use R1? That would give 1.2 × 109 . How far off is the flux? A dilemma.\nTimescale: δ2 ' Dt ⇒ steady state. Here t ' δ2/D = 125000 seconds, about a day and a half.\nDesign: what to do to improve throughput?\n- Smaller δ: possible breakage\n- Higher D: change glass, raise temperature\n- Higher ΔC: raise/lower temperature, change glass\nOkay, that was the braindead 1D solution. What about the real cylinder?\nCylindrical coordinates So, Cout at outside, Cin at inside, what to do between? Use R1 and R2 for\ninner, outer radii. Fick's first, assume 1D, so C is function of r only.\ndC\nJr = -D\n(2.9)\ndr\nConservation: in at r + Δr, out at r, no gen or accum, area 2πrL:\n0 = [2πrLJr ]r - [2πrLJr ]r+Δr ,\n(2.10)\n\ndivide by 2πL, Δr → 0:\n0 = - d\ndr [rJr ]\n(2.11)\nPlug in flux:\n\n0 = d\ndr\nrD dC\ndr\n.\n(2.12)\nNow solve:\nA0\n= rD dC\ndr\n(2.13)\nA0\nDr\n=\ndC\ndr\n(2.14)\nC\n= A ln r + B\n(2.15)\nwhere A = A0/D. From BCs:\nC - Cin\nCout - Cin\n= ln(r/R1)\nln(R2/R1)\n(2.16)\nCheck at R1 and R2, units.\nFlux= -DdC/dr:\ndC\nJr = -D\n= -D d\nCin + (Cout - Cin) ln(r/R1)\n= DCin - Cout 1 .\n(2.17)\ndr\ndr\nln(R2/R1)\nln(R2/R1) r\nImportant result: not flux, but flux times area.\ndC\nAJr = -2πrLD\n= 2πrLDCin - Cout 1 .\n(2.18)\ndr\nln(R2/R1) r\nNote rs cancel, so AJr is constant for all r. Make sure units work. Cool.\nNumbers, result: 1.8×10-9 . Between the 1D estimates. Overestimated flux, at R2 is really 1.44 × 10-12 ,\ntwice that at R1, so R1 value is closer.\nMore important: cartesian gave wrong design criterion! Not minimize δ, but minimize R2/R1! Double\nproduction by going from 2 to\n√\n2 because ln(\n√\n2) = 1\n2 ln(2), e.g. 3 mm OD with no change in thickness!\nOther design issues: helium on inside or outside? Inside means glass is in tension, outside compression. But\nif gas is dirty, inside is easier to clean.\nNote: on problem set 2, will derive this for a sphere for a drug delivery device. Pretty cool.\n\n2.2\nSeptember 8, 2003: SteadyState with Homogeneous Chemi\ncal Reaction\nMechanics:\n- New recitations: R12, F2, both in 8306.\n- Fri: very different lecture, ABET stuff.\nNames.\nMuddy stuff:\n- Recitations. :)\n- Dislike cgs units.\n- Clearer writing and neater presentation.

RCC carbon fiberreinforced graphite composite! Very\nhightemperature, highstrength. Carbon fiber preform, model as a porous material, diffusion of acetylene\nto the surfaces of the fibers, at high temp it decomposes and deposits graphite.\nProblem: as it deposits, it seals off the entrances, nonconstant diffusivity.

Makes sense.\nSo, have process, want to double thickness with same uniformity, can't change D much, how much change\nk? Drop by factor of 4. Problem: takes four times as long!!\nThe real solution: blow acetylene through it!\nWhat does this look like? Pay attention to\nk\nL\nk . Can either be sorta uniform,\nD\n\n2.3\nSeptember 10, 2003: UnsteadyState Diffusion\nTODO:\n- Check reading room to make sure texts are there.\n- Bring: cards, class list.\n- Check W3R pages for this lecture.\nNAMES!\nMechanics:\n- Get office hours together.\n- Pump the zephyr instance.\n- Fri: very different lecture, ABET stuff.\nMuddy stuff:\n- Cylindrical gradient (W3R appendices AB, p. 695-700):\n∂C\nrC =\nrˆ + 1 ∂C θˆ+ dC z,\n(2.33)\nˆ\n∂r\nr ∂θ\ndz\n∂2C\n1 ∂C\n1 ∂2C\n∂2C\n=\n+\n+\n(2.34)\nr2C\n∂r2\nr ∂r\nr2 ∂θ2 + ∂z2 , or\n∂2C\n∂2C\n∂\n∂C\n(2.35)\n=\nr\n+ r2 ∂θ2 + ∂z2 , or\nr ∂r\n∂r\n(2.36)\n- During derivations, important points are obscured. \"What we've learned\" summaries help. Basi\ncally following outline mentioned before, on p. 465 of W3R. Also feel free to snooop around Athena\ndirectory...\n- How to draw exponentials in concentration profile?\n- Plotting hyperbolic trig functions--necessary? No. If needed, use calc/table.\n- Too quick jump from integ consts to carbon fiber material, missed lots.\n- Keep C2H2 conc constant for constant rate? Not quite, keep it uniform.\n- How to calculate C2H2 consumption rate? Use concentration (or partial pressure) and reaction con\nstant. But often don't know reaction constant, need to try at various temperatures, or just do what\nwe did--find something which works, and use this methodology to understand why and how to make\nwork for new designs.\n- How do we get:\ndC\ndC\nd2C\nx -\ndx\ndx x+Δx\nlim\nΔx→\n+ G?\n(2.37)\n+ G = D\n0 -D\nΔx\ndx2\nDerivative of the derivative is the second derivative?\n- Arrhenius plot: which part is diffusionlimited, which part reactionlimited? Can't really compare\nbecause of different units. But can sort of make a plot of log(kL2/D) vs. 1/T , look at different\nparts. Want: lowtemperature reactionlimited case, with fast diffusion to wipe out conc gradients.\nDiffusionlimited means it doesn't diffuse in very far.\nNext Monday: reaction and diffusion in series, which dominates is more straightforward, can easily\ncompare the different coefficient.\n\np\np\n\n- How did\nk/DL/2 become kL2/D? What's important for design: if two designs have the same kL2/D,\nthen have the same\nk/DL/2, same uniformity. So use the simpler one to guide design decisions. Get\ninto further with dimensional analysis next week.\n- Why no flux at x = 0? Because of symmetry: on left, flux goes right; on right, flux goes left; in middle,\nflux goes... nowhere! Symmetry, or zeroflux boundary condition, like PS2 #3.\nUnsteady Diffusion Last two times: stories to take home: increasing production rate of helium from\nnatural gas, highquality manufacturing of reinforced carboncarbon for space shuttle wing, nose leading\nedge tiles. This time: math first, examples later, because three different solutions to the diffusion equation,\nexamples can use one or more.\nNow accumulation != 0, rate also in mol/sec = V ∂C/∂t. Chapter 27 material. Resulting equation in\n1D:\n∂C\n∂2C\n= D\n+ G.\n(2.38)\n∂t\n∂x2\nPhysical intuition: concentration curvature is either due to generation, or leads to time evolution, or both.\nUpward curvature means neighbors diffuse in, either G negative or C increases; downward means diffuse out,\neither G positive or C decreases.\nToday focus on zerogeneration solutions which you've seen before, to be used in this class (book derives\nthem using Laplace transforms...):\nError function:\n-\nx\nC\n= Aerf(c)\n+ B,\n(2.39)\n√\nDt\n∂C\nx\nx2\n∂t\n= -\n√\nπDt3 exp -4DT\n,\n(2.40)\n∂C\nx\n∂x\n=\n√π 2\n√\nDt\nexp -4DT\n,\n(2.41)\n∂2C\n2x\nx\n=\nexp\n∂x2\n-√\nπDt 4Dt\n-4DT\n(2.42)\nx\nx\n= -\n√\nπD3t3 exp -4DT\n.\n(2.43)\nSo this satisfies equation 2.38.\nWhat it looks like: graph erf, erfc; discuss constant C BC x = 0\nC = C0, uniform C IC t = 0\n⇒\n⇒\nC = Ci.

(Not many parts are semi\nL\ninfinite...) Since erf(2)=0.995 and erfc(2)=0.005, we can approximate inf' 2, if 2\n√\nDt > 2, then erf is\nabout 1 and erfc about 0, can consider semiinfinite.

The day meant a lot of things to a lot of people. Yesterday the occasion was commemorated\nin a number of ways, here in Boston, in my hometown of New York City, and around the country and the\nworld. I can't hope to be as profound as some of the speakers at those services, but can talk about a few\nthings it meant to me personally, in particular as I have reflected on my decision to become an engineer,\nand my purpose in the profession. Perhaps some of it will resonate with one or two of you; I invite your\ncomments or questions, and we'll take as long for this as we have to.\nI'd like to start nine days before the tragedy, when I was in New York for my sisterinlaw's wedding. My\nwife's parents live in Brooklyn, which is where the ceremony was held, but we were staying with her aunt\nand uncle in Long Island. At least twice a day in the few days beforehand, we drove the Belt Parkway and\nBrooklynQueens Expressway, wrapping around Brooklyn, passing under the Verazzano bridge and entering\nNew York Harbor, with the view of the Statue of Liberty and the majestic buildings rising ahead, the skyline\ndominated, of course, by the World Trade Center.\nDuring those drives, I recalled the experience of my High School French teacher Mr. Schwartzbart, an\nAustrian Jew who survived World War II in a rural Belgian boys' camp which, unknown to him at the\ntime, was made up entirely of Jewish boys, and in fact, was set up to keep them safe throughout the Nazi\noccupation. He described the terror he felt under the occupation, and then the arrival of the American\nsoldiers, \"All of them giants,\" he said, then pointed to me, \"like Adam,\" they had come to set the continent\nfree.\nAnd he described the journey to America as a young teenager, a transforming experience. Most amazing\nwas the entry of his ship carrying scores of poor immigrants like himself into New York Harbor, this impossibly\nenormous bridge which just got bigger and bigger as they approached (the Verazzano was the longest span\nin the world for about 50 years), the tranquility of the harbor within, with the great buildings visible\nahead including the Empire State, and the Statue of Liberty to his left as they steamed toward Ellis Island\n(the World Trade Center's construction was still 20 years away). There was an aweinspiring sense of the\nmagnitude of this great nation of impossible size which had overwhelmed some of the greatest evil the world\nhad ever known, and his heart swelled with joy at the thought that there was such power on the side of\nliberty.\nThese days in is fashionable to reflexively cringe at the identification of this country with freedom,\nand this teacher in particular very frequently commented cynically on the deficiencies in American culture\nand education. Having come to know this side of him, when we asked why he came to this country, Mr.\nSchwartzbart's reply surprised us: \"The land of the free and the home of the brave.\" Then after a pause,\n\"It really is true.\" His personal experience of this gave great weight to these words.\nDuring these drives along the Belt Parkway, my thoughts also turned toward the fragility of the grand\nedifices, and in particular to the 1993 bombing of the underground parking lot of one of the Twin Towers.\nFortunately the towers withstood that attempt to destroy them, but there would surely be more attempts,\nand no amount of devastation was too horrible for the perpetrators to dream up. Should anything happen, I\nwas grateful for the opportunity to see this beauty, and even to feel a small piece of what Paul Schwartzbart\nhad felt some fifty years earlier. I thought of how fortunate is his generation which came through the\nDepression, fought that terrible war, and lived to see the nation preside over such a long and prosperous\npeacetime as the world had perhaps never before known.\nSo you can imagine my shock when just nine days later, as I sat in my office, my wife called from home\nto say that while watching CNN, they announced that a plane had crashed into the World Trade Center.\nWell, I thought, about 60 years ago a small plane hit the Empire State building, I'm sure there was a lot\nof damage and many people killed, but the rest of the building should be fine. Just a few minutes later\nshe called again to tell me about the second plane, and suddenly I was afraid. Then the Pentagon, and the\nmissing plane in Pennsylvania. My thoughts turned to the MidEast, and this administration's policy of\ndeliberate neglect in the IsraeliPalestinian peace process. Then the last call, one tower had collapsed. With\nher voice choking from the tears, she described its fall as \"like a house of cards,\" and could say little more.\n\nImmediately, I logged out, got on my bike, and pedaled home as fast as I could.\nI'm sure each of us can tell a story about where we were when it happened. Being from New York, I was\nimmediately concerned for friends and family. My wife's grandmother went to the roof of her building in\nQueens, from where she saw the second plane hit the south tower, and that tower's collapse. I had shared\nthis view every day growing up as I rode the Roosevelt Island tramway to school and saw these buildings\nwhich seemed as permanent as mountains. My wife's best friend in College, who lives in the Prospect Heights\nsection of Brooklyn and works in the southern tip of Manhattan, noticed people in his neighborhood looking\nup and saw some smoke, but rushed into the subway as he was late for work; the packed subway stopped\nafter it left Brooklyn and waited in the tunnel for about 20 minutes before it turned back and he got out\nand learned what had happened. My Elementary School best friend worked in the 17th floor of Tower 1,\nand had a bad back which would have made it painful and difficult to get out--if he hadn't been home sick\nthat day.\nThen there was my father's friend whom I know well and whose business had just finished moving into\nthe 89th floor of Tower 1. His staff had been told not to come in that morning until 10 AM, because their\ncarpets, freshly washed during the 17 AM shift, would need to finish drying. As he drove north on the New\nJersey Turnpike, he saw the first plane crash right through the windows of his new office, then took the next\nexit and went right back to his daughter's kindergarten class.\nThe previous Spring and Summer I had a course 6 UROP student in my group. His brother worked\nabove the 90th floor of Tower 2, and on the first and second day afterward without a word to anyone in his\nfamily, my student grew panicked, then desparate, then increasingly hopeless. His brother finally called to\nsay that a friend had literally dragged him from the office after the first plane hit, and they ran out of the\nbuilding together just as the second plane smashed into it. He described bits of the hell that was the area\naround him, but at the time had no other thought than to get away, go home and lie down in shock, not\neven thinking about his relatives who were trying to reach him. My student described the moment when\nthey connected as one of the happiest of his life.\nAnother friend was not so fortunate. Her father worked in an upper floor of Tower 2, and was one of\njust two in his company who didn't make it out. To make matters worse, she was trapped in L.A. because\nof grounded planes, unable to get back and try to locate him, so day upon day she was not only uncertain\nand hurting but frustrated at being far from anyone who could help her. She is still grieving, as it's hard to\naccept that she lost the closest person to her in the world because a handful of maniacs decided to crash a\nplane into his building.\nThere are of course tens of thousands more stories like these, so many people were affected directly or\nknew someone who was. But even if you were not so directly involved, if you're like me, the tragedy didn't\nend on that day, but played out over and over again in your mind. I can't count how many mornings in the\nensuing months I woke up at 3 AM thinking about the towers' collapse, feeling hurt, afraid, angry, and much\nas I hate to admit it, somewhat vindictive as we learned of the total destruction of the Al Queda camps and\ncave complexes in Afghanistan.\nThen thoughts turned to my own life. What can I do, what's my role in the world, how can I help?\nI turned to the motivations I had for entering science and engineering, and materials science in particular,\nwhich I came up with in High School. Motivations for studying these things vary greatly, from interest in\nthe subject matter, elegance of the equations, beauty of nature etc., to being able to earn a stable income\nand support a household, or perhaps a large income, to serving society in some way. My own motivations\nfell somewhat in the first category, but if I had followed that alone I would have been 63 (computer science);\nit was the last of these categories, serving society, which steered me into Materials Science.\nAs a high school student, I verbalized this service as follows. As a scientist or engineer, I would be helping\nto solve the world's little problems, which I listed as:\n- Agriculture, to feed a growing planet.\n- Medicine, allowing people to lead longer, healthier lives.\n- Transportation and communications, to bring people together and lessen the chances of conflict. For\nexample, much of the reason war between France and Germany today is unthinkable is because there\nare so many more personal crossborder relationships now than in 1940 or 1914, it's very difficult for a\npropagandist to castigate an entire people as \"the enemy\" and it's becoming more difficult every year.\n\n- Human interactions with the environment, for sustainable living.\n- A recent addition, information access, with implications for democracy, as the biggest enemy of an\nauthoritarian state is the truth.\nAll of these are important in themselves, but even more important, if we do our jobs well and make a\ndifference in these areas, we help the artists, politicians, economists, philosophers and theologians to solve\nthe big problems, which I would list as:\n- World peace.\n- Averting famines, and their relief. Almost all famines can be avoided without resort to international\naid, and are the result of poor resource management or hoarding.\n- Real public health, made available to those who need it around the world.\n- Justice, including somewhat equitable economic distribution.\n- Truth in journalism and history.\n- Human happiness and fulfillment.\n- Purpose and meaning for our lives.\n- Artistic expression of emotions, of values, of that purpose and meaning.\n- Last year Ross Benson added: Tolerance of differences.\nAn important consequence of this understanding of \"little problems\" and \"big problems\" is that being a\nscientist or engineer requires a lot of faith, faith that our knowledge and our inventions will be used wisely,\nfor good and not for evil. The more \"sciencey\" our contributions, the more faith is necessary, with the\nultimate example perhaps being nuclear science, which can be used to produce lots of cheap power or cure\ndiseases, or destroy entire cities in an instant. If we work on weapons, they can of course be used for defense\nor for aggression.\nBut even if we're not working on nuclear science or weaponry, one of the lessons of September 11 for me\nis that no matter how careful we are to focus on purely nonmilitary technologies, this tragedy showed that\neven a civilian jetliner--built to bring people together--can be abused by people with sufficient hatred as a\nweapon of mass destruction. This is truly frightening for us, and requires us to have that much more faith\nin the people, institutions and systems surrounding the technology in whose development we participate.\nSo what should we do? Shall we abandon technology altogether and go back to rubbing sticks together?\nPerhaps we should join the peace corps? For some of us that will be the answer, but I think there's a lot\nmore that can be done with the little problems that can help to make a real impact on the big ones. So how\ncan we put ourselves in positions to do as much good as possible?\nI can think of a few ways, but at your age and even at mine, perhaps the most important is to take a\nstep back and examine what we're doing and why. I have an advisee taking this class now who took off all\nof last Spring for that very purpose, and ended up returning to MIT (and in fact to Materials Science) that\nmuch more focused than the previous December for the experience. Of course, you don't have to take off a\nsemester to do this, there are very good ways to do some of this right here.\nFirst, the HASS and HASSD subjects present outstanding opportunities for this kind of exploration.\nMIT is no longer just about training technology leaders, but also about training world leaders who know\nabout technology, and this school has put enormous resources into building world class departments in the\nHumanities, Arts and Social Sciences. For example, I've heard tremendous things about our Anthropology\ndepartment from a variety of external sources, and even within our department we offer a HASS subject\ncalled Materials in the Human Experience (3.094) every Spring.\nSecond, I've made a point of suggesting to all of my advisees that they get to know the MISTI programs\n(I think that stands for MIT Internships in Science, Technology and Industry), which do an outstanding job\nnot just of sending students to companies, universities and government labs in foreign countries, but also\npreparing them for the trip, even culturally and psychologically.\n\nThird, develop a habit of using your wealth to support organizations and causes which effectively promote\nwhat you view as positive values. You may not have much now, but you will later, and getting into this habit\nis not hard; furthermore, membership in many of these organizations requires a contribution of as little as\n$30. If you like I can discuss offline some of the organizations I've given to since my undergraduate years,\none even since high school.\nFourth, look for opportunities to participate in the process of improving lives yourselves. Whether\ntutoring or mentoring, or working in a social justice organization, or writing to Congress, participating\nin society in a meaningful way is important to making it all work, and I believe important to improving\nourselves too. Believe it or not, time is actually one resource which you will not have more of later in life\nthan you have now, particularly if children become part of your life.\nFifth and perhaps most importantly, get to know your fellow students. This buzzword is repeated over\nand over again, but it's worth repeating yet again: because MIT attracts the best and brightest from all over\nthe world, the diversity of the students on this campus is truly extraordinary, it's almost certainly broader\nand deeper than anything you've experienced before college, and almost certainly broader and deeper than\nanything you will ever experience later in life. That goes for Cambridge as well, and many other universities,\nthough much less so on the graduate level and beyond. And by getting to know your colleagues, I don't just\nmean hanging out and eating pizza, nor even getting to know what spices they use to cook lamb, though\nfood is of course an important part of social interaction. I'd encourage you to learn something about your\nfriends' lives, their families, their values--and be willing to discuss these aspects of yourselves too.\nAnd given its importance, I'd encourage you to learn something about your friends' faith. Human\ninstitutions, organizations, systems and even nations are terrific, but never perfect, as we learned in a\npowerful way on September 11. Participating in and strengthening them is an important and honorable\nactivity, but I believe that placing all of our hope on them is not viable in the long term. At some point\nthey're going to let us down, as this country has in some ways let down my French teacher Mr. Schwartzbart.\nFurthermore, evidence abounds for forces at work in the universe beyond those of physics, and even grows\nwith the increase of human knowledge about this universe; perhaps the most significant example is the\nAnthropic Principle in Cosmology, which some of you may have heard of and I'd be happy to discuss offline.\nThat concludes what I said last year: the tragedy reminds us that our work here is very important, but\nmust be viewed in context, and done with faith that it will be used for the broad purposes for which we\nintend it. Since last year, time has passed and some of the emotions have subsided just a bit, also several\nimportant things have happened, or have not happened, causing my own feelings about this to be somewhat\nmore complicated.\nFor one thing, the message from Washington continues to urge us to live out lives as if nothing had\nhappened, because if we changed anything, we'd be giving the terrorists what they want. But this is\nfoolishness, important things have changed, and as citizens there are things we can do on a daily basis to\nimprove our country's security, and the silence from Washington has been deafening.\nA few months ago I saw a book provocatively titled, \"When you ride alone, you ride with bin Laden.\"\nThe cover art was derived from a World War II poster, \"When you ride alone, you ride with Hitler,\" whose\npoint was that the practices of avoiding driving, carpooling, and using public transportation save gasoline\nneeded for the war effort. In that vein, an important thing which has not happened is that there has been no\neffort whatsoever on a national level to reduce our dependence on imported oil, which has been a huge factor\nin our problems in the Middle East. In fact, we've seen the opposite in this administration's rollback in fuel\neconomy standards, and heard talk about the costs to the auto manufacturers and consumers of requiring\nincreases in efficiency, with no mention whatsoever of the multitude of costs of continuing to burn fossil fuels\nas extravegantly as we like.\nAnother thing which has changed my view of the world was the war in Iraq. For months, the administra\ntion hyped any evidence at all for Iraqi connections to Al Qaeda and possession or development of weapons\nof mass destruction. Then inspections were allowed (to be fair, largely due to U.S. pressure, and no thanks\nto the posturing of certain countries like France), and onebyone the inspections eliminated every piece of\npurported WMD evidence save the rumor about uranium purchase from Niger. And so with that one rumor\nas justification, we sent an invasion force to Kuwait, and used technological superiority to destroy the Iraqi\narmy in about four weeks.\nI believe that the war was wrong for a number of reasons. First, as mentioned, it was completely\n\nunjustified. There was no correlation to terrorism, none to weapons of mass destruction, and there are a\ndozen dictators around the world whose human rights violations could similarly motivate action. If violation\nof U.N. resolutions was the motive, then it's up to the U.N. to act.\nSecond, this war was an extremely imprudent waste of resources. It is unwise to spend a couple of hundred\nbillion dollars on a flimsilyjustified war in a time of record deficits, and even more imprudent to tie down\nfifteen of the U.S. Army's thirtythree combat brigades in that occupation during a time of multiple threats\nfrom WMD in North Korea and Iran, to shaky stability in Afghanistan, to lowlevel al Qaeda activity from\nIndonesia to Somalia. And most significant is the loss of hundreds of American and thousands of Iraqi lives,\nvery nearly including that of my own brother, a Captain in the U.S. Army third infantry division's second\nbrigade, whose unit was hit by an Iraqi missile just after their capture of downtown Baghdad. Like my\nCourse 6 UROP student two years ago, the days between learning of the attack and confirming my brother's\nsafety were some of the longest of my life. I cannot imagine the terror and grief of hundreds of thousands of\nloved ones of Iraqi soldiers who did not know for weeks or months whether their sons, brothers, husbands or\nfathers were dead or alive, nor the pain of those whose worst fears were in the end confirmed.\nFinally, the war has cost us diplomatically, and will continue to cost us potentially for many genera\ntions. The arrogance with which the administration shrugged off overwhelming international opposition was\nshocking, prticularly as it involved three of the five Security Council permanent members, some of our most\nimportant allies, and both of our neighbors. Even more shocking was the pathetically childish pettiness with\nwhich the administration spoke of \"punishing\" the opponents to the war--particularly the French--and then\nturned around to ask them to contribute money and troops to the occupation and reconstruction to reduce\nthe resource burden on us. But in the long term, the most diplomatically destructive aspect of the war is\nthe precedent it sets for accusing a nation of violations of one sort or another, putting aside international\noutcry for restraint, and using military superiority to crush the weaker victim. This precedent can easily\nbe abused by, say, Turkey, Syria, Egypt, Jordan and Saudi Arabia against Israel, North Korea against the\nSouth, Russia against the former Soviet Republics, China against Taiwan--any nation with a fight to pick\ncan say, \"But of course it's been done before, by the Land of the Free and Home of the Brave!\"\nAnd so we are reminded of our duty as citizens to speak out about matters of importance to our country.\nAnd in particular, as scientists and engineers we have the duty to speak out with authority on certain issues\nsuch as the small cost of reducing energy consumption, and the enormous costs of not doing so. Most of\nall, in the changed world our need for faith is greater than ever, in our work as well as our outlook for the\nfuture. I welcome any comments, contributions, or questions.\nABET Sheet Review See the ABET sheet.\nUnsteady Diffusion Continued Muddy stuff:\n- Symbol conventions: Ci is initial, C0 I use as surface and sometimes other things; Cs always surface\nconcentration.\n- Physical meaning of graphs, interpretation of these things: coming soon.\nExact criteria for each solution: will be summarized.\n-\n- Semiinfinite and erf validity. First, semiinfinite applies to onesided erf and onesided shrinking\nGaussian. Fully infinite applies to twosided both.

Apologies to those affected, particularly language.\nForms a strong part of 9/11 feelings, particularly as administration has done its best to tie them\ntogether. Uncomfortable with talking about one side and not the other. War must always be a last\nresort when other means e.g. negotiation have been tried. Defining objectives as narrowly as \"regime\nchange\" with neither aggression nor clear and present danger (Bush and Clinton) is as misguided and\nwrong as extremists in the region who call for destrurction of a certain state \"by any means necessary\".\nOpen for last words...\nContinuing where we left off last time (did the erf and shrinking Gaussian):\nFourier Series:\n-\nC\n= a exp(-b2Dt) sin(bx)(or cos),\n(2.55)\n∂C\n= -ab2D exp(-b2Dt) sin(bx),\n(2.56)\n∂t\n∂C\n= ab exp(-b2Dt) cos(bx),\n(2.57)\n∂x\n∂2C\n= -ab2 exp(-b2Dt) sin(bx).\n(2.58)\n∂x2\n(2.59)\nElegant and simple.

Note linearity of diffusion equation: any sum of solutions is also a\nsolution. So we can add sine waves to get something more useful, use that.\nFourier transform: express any initial condition as sum of sine waves. We'll do one: square wave of\nperiod 2L for multilayer material annealing, each term has period 2L/n so bn = nπ/L:\ninf\n\nX\nn2π2Dt\nnπx\nC =\nan exp -\nL2\nsin\n.\n(2.61)\nL\nn=0\nThe Fourier transform:\nan =\n, n odd, 0, n even.\n(2.62)\nnπ\nIllustrate different sine functions, how they add to a square wave.

Graph\namplitude vs. time, show n = 3 drops out nine times faster, n = 5 twentyfive times faster. Do it as\nt/τ , where τ = L2/π2D, so first term is exp(-t/τ ), second exp(-9t/τ ). One term remains real fast.\nConsider: t = L2/D...

Then linear\nplus Fourier series, with odd and even n; even so, at t = L2/D, first term, max conc is a tiny fraction\nof original. So, very close to steadystate!\nWhich to use?

At very small times,\ncan consider even the zinc as semiinfinite. Also, at small times t < δ2/D, shrinking Gaussian doesn't\nwork, goes to infinitely tall and thin.\n- What to use in example 3 between δ2/16D < t < δ2/D? Nothing covered here; perhaps another\nFourier transform...\n- Write down initial conditions for examples... Added to lecture notes, in my home directory.\nDiffusion boundary conditions Types:\nConstant C: what's that C?\n-\n- Constant flux: sealed means zero, sometimes ion beams, etc. (not often)\n- Flux vs. C, for chemical reaction or mass transfer coefficient. J = k(C - Ceq ) (note ChemEs' k00...)\nUnits: k in cm/s. Also mass transfer coefficient through fluid film: J = hD (C - Ceq ), where hD = δ/D.\nExample: gas diffusion in metal. Oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen in metals: diffuses monoatomically,\n2O(m) ⇔ O2(g), equation:\npO2 .\n(2.66)\nKeq = [O]\nSo oxygen concentration at equilibrium is proportional to the square root of pressure. (Not the same for\nhelium, argon, etc.) Then if flux is proportional to difference in concentrations, it's proportional to square\nroot of difference in partial pressures!\nMisconception 1: Equilibrium is NOT steadystate. Global equilibrium here would be a brick of SiO2. Local\nequilibrium gives concentrations at interface sometimes. Can be out of local equilibrium and at steady state\ntoo.\nMisconception 2: kinetic reaction rate order is NOT thermodynamic order.\nLayer growth Motivating example: silicon oxidation (example W3R pp. 487489). Electronic components,\nthis is the \"gate oxide\" in MOSFETs, draw pnp structure. Thickness must be tightly controlled for the\nFET to work--to switch at the right voltage. How to make the oxide? Expose it to air, and it just grows.\nCool. Wet oxidation too: expose it to steam and it grows differently (slower?). How much does it grow, how\nlong to leave it there?\nGo to the phase diagram, this one is pretty simple. Start with equilibrium. Many times, can use the\nphase diagram. Others, with impure phases (like air), or partial pressure or total pressure dependency, need\nactivity to get equilibrium concentration at interface.\nOut of equilibrium, but interfaces at local equilibrium: diffusionlimited, explain the concept of pseudo\nsteadystate. Growth is really slow because, although D might be high leading to steadystate, C3 - C1 is\nreally small, leading to slow flux, really slow growth of the layer.

Then introduce C2 between C1 and C3, say the rate is proportional\nto C2 - C1, proportionality constant is the reaction rate coefficient which we call k.

Want to keep T - Tfl, t, r; choose h also. Eliminate R, Ti - Tfl, k, ρcp.\n5. πT is easy, as is πr. πh: eliminated by k and R. πt is funny, use k for seconds, ρcp for Joules, R for\nremaining meters. Result is the Fourier number, the ratio of t/tSS.\nNote: could have used h to eliminate seconds, but result wouldn't have been as cool: πt = ht/ρcpR.\n6.

Sorry about that.\n- What's this bit about applying to different shapes? We left everything general, with volume and area,\nso whether a sphere, rod, plate, or crumpled up piece of paper, it just works.\nThe book takes a different approach to the graphs in Appendix F: πT vs. πt for various πh, graphs at\ndifferent πr.

Because at low Biot number, T is uniform, not a function of r or\nh\nπr .\nFinite differences Very often no analytical solution to a system. (Or if there is one, it's impossibly\ncomplex.) So, use a computer, make some approximations.\n- Discretize space: calculate temperature at a finite number of points on a grid (here 1D). Choose xi,\ncalculate Ti. For simplicity, we'll choose evenlyspaced points, so xi+1 - xi = Δx.\n- Discretize time: calcluate temperature at a finite number of \"timesteps\" at times tn, so with both, we\nhave Ti,n.

Brief introduction to rich topic, of which people spend lifetimes studying one small\npart. You will likely be confused at the end of this lecture, come to \"get it\" over the next two or three.\nCategories: laminar, turbulent; tubes and channels; jets, wakes. Compressible, incompressible.\nOutcomes: flow rates (define), drag force (integral of normal stress), mixing. Later couple with diffusion\nand heat conduction for convective heat and mass transfer.\nStart: the 3.185 way. Momentum field, \"momentum diffusion\" tensor as shear stress. Show this using\nunits: momentum per unit area per unit time:\nkg m\nkg\n= N\ns =\nm2 s\nm · s2\nm2\n·\nTwo parallel plates, fluid between, zero and constant velocity. xmomentum diffusing in zdirection, call\nit τzx, one component of 2ndrank tensor. Some conservation of math:\naccumulation = in - out + generation\nTalking about momentum per unit time,\nkg\ns2 , locally momentum per unit volume ρ~u. Here suppose ux\nm·\nvaries only in the zdirection, no τxx or τyx, no uy or uz. Three conservation equations for three components\nof momentum vector, here look at xmomentum:\n∂(ρux)\nV\n= A · τzx\nτzx|z+Δz + V\nFx\n·\n∂t\n|z - A ·\n·\n\nDo this balance on a thin layer between the plates:\nWxWzΔz ∂(ρux) = WxWzτzx z - WxWzτzx z+Δz + WxWzΔzFx\n∂t\n|\n|\nCancel WxWz and divide by Δz, let go to zero:\n∂(ρux) =\n∂τzx + Fx\n∂t\n- ∂z\nWhat's generation? Body force per unit volume, like gravity. Units: N/m3 (like τ has N/m2), e.g. ρg.\nWhat's the constitutive equation for τzx? Newtonian fluid, proportional to velocity gradient:\n∂ux\n∂uz\nτzx = -μ\n+\n∂z\n∂x\nThis defines viscosity μ, which is the momentum diffusivity. Units: N · s/m2 or kg/m · s, Poiseuille. CGS\nunits: g/cm · s, Poise = 0.1 Poiseuille. Water: .01 Poise = .001 Poiseuille.\nSo, sub constitutive equation in the conservation equation, with uy = 0:\n∂(ρux) =\n∂\n∂ux\n+ Fx\n-μ\n∂t\n- ∂z\n∂z\nWith constant ρ and μ:\n∂ux\n∂2ux\nρ\n= μ\n+ Fx\n∂t\n∂z2\nIt's a diffusion equation!\nSo at steady state, with a bottom plate at rest and a top plate in motion in the xdirection at velocity\nU, we have: a linear profile, ux = Az + B.\nAaliyah tribute: innovative complex beats, rhythmic singing, great performing.

Too late to register though :(\nMuddy from last time:\n- Is the velocity in the xdirection, or the zdirection? xdirection, but it is quite confusing, τzx is\nflux of xmomentum in zdirection. Momentum is a vector, so we have three conservation equations:\nconservation of xmomentum, ymomentum, zmomentum. This vector field thing is a bit tricky,\nespecially the vector gradient.\n- I left out: a Newtonian fluid exhibits linear stressstrain rate behavior, proportional. Lots of nonlinear\nfluids, nonNewtonian; we'll get to later.\nIntro: may be confused after last time. This time do a couple more examples with confined flow, including\none cylindrical, hopefully clear some things up.\nFrom last time: parallel plates, governing equation\n∂ux\n∂2ux\nρ\n= μ\n+ Fx\n∂t\n∂z2\n∂ux\n∂2ux\nFx\n= ν\n+\n∂t\n∂z2\nρ\nWe have the diffusion equation! ν is the momentum diffusivity, like the thermal diffusivity k/ρcp before it.\nkg/m·s\nNote: units of momentum diffusivity ν = μ/ρ: kg/m3 = m2/s! Kinematic (ν), dynamic (μ) viscosities.\nNote on graphics: velocities with arrows, flipping the graphs sideways to match orientation of the problem.\nCases:\n- Steadystate, no generation, bottom velocity zero, top U:\nU\nU\nux =\nz, τzx = -μ\nL\nL\nShear stress:\n\n∂ux\n∂uz\nU\nτzx = -μ\n+\n= -μ\n∂z\n∂x\nz\nThus the drag force is this times the area of the plate.\n- Unsteady, no generation, different velocities from t = 0.\n(L - z)2\nux = Uerfc L - z\n, τzx = - 2\n√\nνt\n√π exp\n√\nνt\n-\n4νt\n- New: steadystate, generation, like book's falling film in problem 4.15 of W3R, with θ the inclination\nangle offnormal so gx = g sin θ, z is the distance from the plane. The steadystate equation reduces\nto:\n∂2ux\n0 = μ\n+ Fx\n∂z2\nFxz2\nux = - 2μ + Az + B\n\nBCs: zero velocity at bottom plate at z = 0, free surface with zero shear stress at z = L, Fx = ρgx =\nρg sin θ, result: B=0, get\nux = g sin θ (2Lz - z 2)\n2ν\nShear stress:\n\n∂ux\n∂uz\nτzx = -μ\n+\n= ρg sin θ(L - z)\n∂z\n∂x\nThis is the weight of the fluid per unit area on top of this layer!\nShear stress as the mechanism of momentum flux, each layer pushes on the layer next to it. Think of it as\nmomentum diffusion, not stress, and you'll get the sign right.\nFlow rate: Q, volume per unit time through a surface. If width of the falling film is W , then flow rate is:\nZ\nZ L\n\nW g sin θ Lz2\nz\n= W g sin θ L3\nQ =\n~\nˆ\nu · ndA =\nuxW dz =\nν\n2 - 6\nν\nS\nz=0\nAverage velocity is Q/A, in this case Q/LW :\nQ\ng sin θL2\nuav =\n=\n;\nLW\n3ν\ng sin θL2\numax = ux|z=L =\n2ν\n.\nSo average velocity is 2/3 of maximum for falling film, channel flow, etc.\n\n4.3\nOctober 29: 1D Laminar Newtonian Wrapup, Summary\nMechanics:\n- Next Weds 11/5: 3B Symposium!\nMuddy from last time:\n- Erf solution: why\nux = Uerfc L - z ?\n√\nνt\nAs long as it's semiinfinite, it's an erf/erfc solution (uniform initial condition, constant velocity bound\nary condition), so this works for t ≤ L2/16ν. For erfs, they can start at 0, or somewhere else (zinc\ndiffusion couple), and go \"forward\" or \"backward\". Graph the normal way. Also:\nux = U 1 + erf\nz - L\n√\nνt\n- Weight of fluid: consider layer of fluid from z to L, it has force in x and zdirections Fg = V ρg sin θ\nand - cos θ respectively. In xdirection, shear goes the other way: Fτ = -τzxA. So force balance for\nsteadystate (no acceleration):\nV\nV ρg sin θ - Aτzx = 0 ⇒ τzx =\nρg sin θ = (L - z)ρg sin θ.\nA\nIn zdirection, this is balanced by pressure:\nP = Patm + ρg cos θ(L - z).\nNice segue into pressuredriven flows. Suppose fluid in a cylinder, a pipe for example of length L and radius\nR, P1 on one end, P2 on other. Net force: (P1-P2)Axs, force per unit volume is (P1-P2)V/Axs = (P1-P2)/L.\nCan shrink to shorter length, at a given point, force per unit volume is ΔP/Δz → ∂P/∂z. This is the pressure\ngeneration term.\nSo, flow in tube: uniform generation throughout (P1 - P2)/L (prove next week), diffusion out to r = R\nwhere velocity is zero.

With these two simplifications, velocity profile between the cylinder and\nram is linear, making the problem a lot simpler.\n- In problem 4a, Arrhenius means proportional to exp(-ΔGa/RT ). For part b, think about what\nhappens to glasses as they cool...\n- In problem 5, think about conduction through a multilayer wall, in terms of the interface condition.\nAlso, just as the multilayer wall has two layers with different values of A and B in the temperature\ngraph T=Ax+B, here we have two fluid layers with different values of A and B in the falling film\nsolution given in class (that solution is the answer to part a). The Reynolds number will be discussed\nin tomorrow's lecture.\nMuddy from last time:\nCrossbar on z.\n-\nP1 -P2\n- Why is A = 0, B =\n4μL R2 in tube?

It might\nhave \"normal\" components, but if you rotate it right, it's all shear.\n- What's the difference between a liquid and a Newtonian fluid? Liquids are fluids, as are gases, and\nplasmas. Definition: finite (nonzero) shear strain rate for small stresses. Bingham plastic not tech\nnically a fluid, nor in a sense is a strict powerlaw pseudoplastic (though tends to break down near\n0).\nThe NavierStokes equations!

If axisymmetric and flow is mostly θ, then can use this as \"fullydeveloped\".\nEdge effects: flow direction, large variation direction, third direction is \"edge\" direction. For tube flow,\nwas θ, so axisymm is equiv to \"no edge effects\". For rodcup, will be something else.\nDrag force Integrated traction (force per unit area) in one direction. For tubes, it's in the zdirection,\nuse the shear traction (stress) times area: Fd = τ · A.

So what about turbulent?\nDensity plays a role because of convective terms. Dimensional analysis:\nτ = f (U, μ, d, ρ)\nFive parameters, three base units, so two dimensionless parameters. Four different nondimensionalizations!\nKeep\nπτ\nπother\nτ\nτ , μ\nρU 2\nπμ =\nμ\nρU d\nτ d\nπρ = ρU d\nτ , ρ\nμU\nμ\nτ d2 ρ\nπU = ρU d\nτ , U\nμ\nμ\nτ\nπd = ρU d\nτ , d\nρU 2\nμ\nFirst and last are essentially the same, though last is more familiar (Reynolds number), so ignore the first.\nThird is just a mess, so throw it out. Second is a great fit to what's above. So use last, or second?\nWith turbulence, there are different curves with different surface roughnesses, roughly proportional to\nU 2 . If use second, get one flat πτ laminar, multiple lines for turbulent πτ . If use first/last, one line for\nlaminar, multiple flats for turbulance (p. 188). So this is generally more convenient.\nDimensionless πτ is called (fanning) friction factor f (ff ). The denominator 2 ρU 2 is the approximate\nkinetic energy density, we'll call it K, a.k.a. dynamic pressure.

This gives us a parameter to relate to the Reynolds number for calculating drag\nforce in more general situations. More examples on the way.\nˆ\n- Or was it ~t, not f ? In that case, traction ~t =\nn, force per unit area. In this case, with n = rˆ,\nσ ·\n~t = (τrr + p, τrθ , τrz ). The relevant one for the zdirection is τrz , but traction is more general, see an\nexample later today.\n- Why was option #4 the \"better\" graph?

Main purpose: removal of hard TiN inclusions often several\nmilimeters across which nucleate cracks and bring down airplanes! (1983 Sioux City, Iowa.)\nSet up problem: sphere going one way usphere, fluid other way uinf, local disturbance but relative velocity\nU = uinf - usphere, relative veloc of fluid in sphere frame. Drag force is in this direction.\nFor a sphere, drag force is slightly different: it has not only shear, but pressure component as well.\nˆ\nTraction ~t = σ · n.

This time, low Re (<0.1)\nmeans Stokes flow, can ignore all convective terms; analytical result in 3.21 notes, drag force:\nFd = 3πμU d = f · ρU 2\nπd2 ⇒ f = 24μ = 24 .\n· 4\nρU d\nRe\n\nIf faster, though not turbulent, f becomes a constant. Graph on W3R p. 153 of f (they call cD ) vs. Re.\nConstant: about 0.44, that's what I've known as the drag coefficient. Cars as low as 0.17, flat disk just\nabout 1, making dynamic pressure a good estimate of pressure difference.\nFor rising/sinking particles, set drag force to buoyancy force, solve for velocity. If not Stokes flow, you're\nin trouble, way to do it but it's complicated.\nCan NOT use this for bubbles. For those, Fd = 2πμUd all the way out to Re=105!\nSo, what about precipitation? Buoyancy force and weight vs. drag force, all sum to zero:\nFw = πd3ρsphere, Fb = πd3ρf luid, Fd = what we just calculated.\nAfter all, if you're not part of the solution, you're part of the precipitate.

For a phenomenon that is literally\nubiquitous, remarkably little of a quantitative nature is known about it. Richard Feynman, the\ngreat Nobel Prizewinning physicist, called turbulence \"the most important problem of classical\nphysics.\" Its difficulty was wittily expressed in 1932 by the British physicist Horace Lamb, who,\nin an address to the British Association for the Advancement of Science, reportedly said, \"I am\nan old man now, and when I die and go to heaven there are two matters on which I hope for\nenlightenment. One is quantum electrodynamics, and the other is the turbulent motion of fluids.\nAnd about the former I am rather optimistic.\"\n\nr\nThat article goes on to talk about direct numerical simulation of all of the details of turbulent flows, of\nwhich I am not a great fan. Why? as pointed out in my JOM article \"3D or not 3D\", even if computers\ncontinue to double in computational power every eighteen months, the fifthpower scaling of complexity with\nlengthscale in three dimensions (cubic in space times quadratic in time) means that the resolution of these\nsimulations will double only every sevenandahalf years!\nTo take a simple illustrative example, direct numerical simulation of turbulence in continuous casting\ninvolves Reynolds numbers on the order of one million, and the smallest eddies are a fraction of a millimeter\nacross and form and decay in a few milliseconds. One must account for interaction with the free surface,\nincluding mold powder melting and entrainment, as well as mold oscillation, and surface roughness of the\nsolidifying metal, since with turbulent flow, the details of these boundary conditions can make a large\ndifference in macroscopic behavior. The formulation alone is daunting, and computational work required to\nsolve all of the equations on each of the tens of trillions of grid points over the millions of timesteps required\nto approach steadystate will be prohibitively costly for many years, perhaps until long after Moore's law\nhas been laid to rest (indeed, the roughly four petabytes of memory required to just store a single timestep\nwould cost about two billion dollars at the time this is being written). Furthermore, postprocessing that\nmany degrees of freedom would not only be computationally difficult, but it is not clear that our minds\nwould be able to comprehend the resulting complexity in any useful way, and further, the exercise would\nbe largely pointless, as one really cares only about coarsegrained averages of flow behavior, and detailed\nbehavior perhaps at certain interfaces.\nAnalysis: for 1 m flow through the nozzle 0.1 m in diameter, with kinematic viscosity of .005/7000' 10-6\ns\nm , this gives us Red ' 105 . Using the larger lengthscale H of the caster, around 1 m, this gives ReH ' 106 ,\ns\nthis is given in the paragraph above. Using standard enengy cascade/Kolmogorov microscale analysis, the\nenergy dissipation rate for the largest turbulent eddies in a tube is given by\n\nU\n,\n∼ μt\nd\nwhere μt is the turbulent viscosity, U the eddy velocity estimated by the average velocity, and d the eddy\nsize estimated by the tube diameter. Combining this with the wellknown Kolmogorov result for the smallest\neddy lengthscale `:\ns\nμ3\n` ∼\nρ2\n(ρ is density) gives the smallest eddy lengthscale as\nμ .\n` ∼ d √Red\nμt\nEven using the conservative estimate of μt = 30μ gives ` ∼ 0.1 mm, in 1 meter cubed this gives a trillion\ngrid points, but you want a few grid points across each smallest eddy which means about a few3 ' 100 times\nmore grid points, hence \"tens of trillions\".\nPut slightly differently, the total rate of energy dissipated in a jet at steadystate is the rate of kinetic\nenergy input, which is the product of volumetric kinetic energy given by dynamic pressure and the flow rate:\nπ\nV = ρU 2 π d2U =\nρU 3d2\n· 4\nm\nTaking the volume as 1 m3, average velocity of 1 s , nozzle diameter of 0.1 m and density of 7000 kg gives\nm\n' 30 W Putting this into the Kolmogorov lengthscale expression again gives ` ∼ 0.1 mm.\n3 .\nm\n\nr\nr\n\n4.12\nNovember 24, 2003: Turbulence, cont'd\nMechanics:\n- Turbulence movie: QC151.T8; guide QC145.2.F5 Barker Media.\nMuddy from last time:\n- Difference between uav and Uinf? I messed up last time, for the entrance length situaiton, we we take\naverage velocity as Uinf, the initial \"free stream\" velocity. Sorry to confuse you last time.\n- On that note, just as we have the dimensionless boundary layer thickness, we also have the dimensionless\nentrance length:\nH2uav\nLe\nReH\nLe =\n=\n100ν ⇒ H\n100 .\nSo a large Reynolds number means a long entrance length (1000 means ten times the channel width),\nand vice versa.\nEnergy cascade and the Kolmogorov microscale. Largest eddy Re=U L/ν, smallest eddy Reynolds number\nu`/ν ∼ 1. Energy dissipation, W/m3; in smallest eddies:\n\ndu\nu\n= η\ndx\n∼ η `2\nAssuming most energy dissipation happens there, we can solve these two equations, get smallest eddy size\nand velocity from viscosity, density and dissipation:\n\nρ`2\n\nu ∼ `\nη ⇒ η\nη ∼ 1\nη3\n` ∼\nρ2\nThis defines the turbulent microscale. For thermal or diffusive mixing, turbulence can mix things down\nto this scale, then molecular diffusion or heat conduction has to do the rest. Time to diffusive mixing in\nturbulence is approximately this `2/D.\nSo suppose we turn off the power, then what happens? Smallest eddies go away fast, then larger ones,\nuntil the whole flow stops. Timescale of smallest is `2/ν, largest is L2/νt, turbulent effective viscosity.

They are: the real velocity, the timesmoothed component of\nvelocity, and the fluctuating component of velocity.\n- What timescale can you find from the lengthscale of the smallest eddies? How would one go about this?\nTwo timescales are relevant here: one is diffusion timescale `2/D, which gives mixing time, and the\ntimescale of formation and elimination of these little eddies `2/ν. When attempting direct numerical\nsimulation of turbulence, this tells how small a timestep one will need (actually, a fraction of this for\naccuracy); this also describes how long the eddies will last after the mixing power is turned off.\nThermal and solutal boundary layers Types: forced, natural convection; forced today, natural later.\nRecall first BL thought experiment on thick polymer sheet extrusion, hot polymer sheet T\nand cold\ninf\nwater Ts. Now it's happening in a liquid, competing thermal and fluid boundary layers with thicknesses δu\nand δT .\nFluid:\nr νx\nδu = 5.0\nUinf\nThermal if flow uniform, same criterion:\nr αx\nδT = 3.6\nUinf\nDimensionless:\nδT\n3.6\n3.6\nx\nUinf x\n√RexPr\nα\nWhen is flow uniform? In a solid, or for much larger thermal boundary layer than fluid, so α >> ν, Pr<< 1.\n\np\nr\nr\nr\nr\nAnother way to look at it:\nδT = 0.72Pr-1/2\nδu\nLarge Prandtl number (>.5) means\nδT = 0.975Pr-1/3\nδu\nLiquid metals (and about nothing else) have small Pr; mass transfer Pr is almost always large. E.g.\nwater ν = 10-6 m = 10-2 cm , but D is typically around 10-5 cm .\ns\ns\ns\nNote: blood platelets diffuse at around D = 10-9, but tumbling blood cells not only stir and increase\ndiffusivity, but somehow platelets end up on the sides of blood vessels, where they're needed. I don't fully\nunderstand...\nHeat and Mass Transfer Coefficients What about h? Start with hx, then hL, as before with fx and\nfL. Let βT = y\nUinf/αx, θ = T - Ts/Tinf - Ts, graph θ vs. βT gives θ = erf(βT /2).\nHeat conduction into the liquid:\n∂T\ndT dθ ∂βT\nqy = -k ∂y = -k dθ dβT ∂y\nU\nqy = k(Ts - Tinf)\ninf = hx(Ts - Tinf)\n√π\nαx\nk\nUinf =\nkρcpU\nhx = √π\nαx\nπx\ninf\nLikewise for mass transfer, ρcp is effectively one, so:\nDU\nhDx =\ninf\nπx\nNext time: average, dimensional analysis, δT < δu case.\n\np\nr\nr\nr\n5.2\nDecember 1, 2003: Nusselt Number, Heat and Mass Transfer\nCoefficients\nMechanics:\n- Evals Wednesday.\nMuddy from last time:\n- In the thermal boundary layer with constant velocity, why is ∂2T /∂x2 << ∂2T /∂y2? That's because\nδ x, so graph T vs. x and vs. y, show yderiv is larger.\nIs there a physical meaning behind δT /δu ∝ Pr-1/2 and δC /δu ∝ Pr-1/3? Yes, see below.\n-\nHeat and mass transfer coefficients Recap last time:\n- Flow and heat/mass transfer: weakly coupled. So far, all laminar.\n- Case 1: much larger thermal(/concentration) boundary layer (Pr<0.1): consider T/C BL to have\nuniform velocity, use same BL formulation as moving solid motivating example: erf solution, δT =\n3.6 αx/Uinf. Here:\nδC /δu or δT /δu = 0.72Pr-1/2 .\nPhysical meaning: grows as sqrt of diffusivity, so ratio is ratio of square roots of diffusivity, which is\ninverse sqrt(Pr).\n- Case 2: smaller thermal(/concentration) boundary layer (Pr>5 or so): consider T/C BL to have linear\nvelocity, smaller velocity means thicker T/C BL. Here:\nδC /δu or δT /δu = 0.975Pr-1/3 .\n- Moving on, back to case 1, calculated q|y=0 from erf solution:\nU\nqy = k(Ts - Tinf)\ninf = hx(Ts - Tinf) ⇒ hx =\nkρcpUinf .\n√π\nαx\nπx\nLikewise for mass transfer:\nr\nDU\nhDx =\ninf .\nπx\nSince that's the local, let's integrate for average, neglecting edge effects:\nZ L\nqav =\nhx(Ts - Tinf)W dx = hL(Ts - Tinf)\nW L\nx=0\nL\n2(Ts - Tinf) q\nkρcpUinfx/π\n= hL(Ts - Tinf)\nL\nx=0\nhL = 2\nkρcpUinf = 2hx|x=L\nπL\nNow for case 2 (highPrandtl), need different formulation. Dimensional analysis of mass transfer:\nhD = f (Df l, U, x, ν)\nFive parameters, two base units (cm, s), so three dimensionless. Eliminate x and D. Then one dimensionless\nis Reynolds (πU ), one is Prandtl (πν ), what's the third?\nhDx\nπhD = Dfl\n\nLooks like the Biot number, right?

Far from it, velocity\nis zero.\n- Why δu ≥δT ? Hot region lifts (or cold region sinks) fluid, so all of the hot/cold region (thermal BL)\nwill be moving (in the velocity BL).

If want\nto go on, take graduate advanced fluid dynamics or heat/mass transfer, will be bored in undergrad class.\nAlso done some computation; for more depth with or without programming experience, try 22.00J/3.021J!\n(Shameless plug...)\nThank Albert for a terrific job as a TA!\nLast muddy questions\n- What is the relevance of the boundary layer thickness to the Bernoulli equation? The boundary layer\nis a region where there is quite a bit of shear, and sometimes turbulence. If it is thin relative to the size\nof the problem (e.g. relative to the diameter of the tube), then most of the fluid will have negligible\nshear.\n- Why such a wierd coordinate system in Bernoulli example 2? Why not just make z = 0 at the bottom\nof the tube? You could do that too, and it would work equally well, it just differs by a constant in the\npotential energy; the way we did it is just more consistent with the first example:\nPoint\nKE\nP\nPE\n∼ 0\npatm\nρg(h1 + h2)\n∼ 0\npatm + ρgh1\nρgh2\nρg(h1 + h2)\npatm - ρgh2\nρgh2\nρg(h1 + h2)\npatm\nBatch and Continuous Flow Reactors For those interested.\nBasic definitions, motivating examples. Economics: batch better for flexibility, continuous for quality\nand no setup time (always on).\nTwo types: volumetric and surface reactors. Volume V, generation due to chemical reaction; we'll discuss\nfirstorder A -→ B, so\nG = - kCA\nFor a volume batch reactor, start with CA,in, dump into reactor, it goes:\naccum = generation\ndCA\nV\n= - V kCA\ndt\nln(CA) = - kt + A\nCA,out = exp (- kt)\nCA,in\nFor mass transferlimited surface batch reactor, say\naccum = out\ndCA,out\nV\n= - AhdCA\ndt\nCA,out\nhD A\n= exp\nt\nCA,in\n- V\nTwo extremes in continuous reactor behavior with flow rate Q: plug flow and perfect mixing.\n\nPlug flow is like a minibatch with tR = V/Q, draw plug in a pipe, derive:\nCA,out\nkV\n= exp\nCA,in\n- Q\nWith a surface, the V s cancel, left with\nCA,out\nhD A\n= exp\nCA,in\n- Q\nPerfect mixing: in, out, gen, no accum, out at CA,out reactor conc:\n0 = QCA,in - QCA,out - kV CA,out\nCA,out =\nQ\n=\nCA,in\nQ + kV\n1 + kV\nQ\nWith area:\nCA,out =\nCA,in\n1 + hD A\nQ\nSay target conversion is 0.01, given volume V , homogeneous with constant k.\nBatch:\n-\n4.6\ntR =\nln(CA,in/CA,out) =\nk\nk\nprodection rate is\nV\nkV\n=\n4.6\nk + tchange\n4.6 + ktchange\n- Plug:\nkV\nkV\nQ =\n=\nln(CA,in/CA,out)\n4.6\nBetter than batch, likely better quality too, less flexible.\n- Perfect mixing:\nkV\nkV\nQ =\n=\nCA,in/CA,out - 1\nMuch smaller than either of the others!\nDead zones and effective volumes!\nHow to tell: tracers, Peclet number.\nOther examples: catalytic combustion (that dimensional analysis problem in PS3), alveoli/breathing\n(continuous/batch mixed).

We assume that\nthe solution for the diffusion equation can be written as a\nproduct of two functions, each depended on only one\nvariable.

The only condition under which the\nequality between the LHS and the RHS is satisfied is if they both evaluate\nto a constant.

This solution leads to a Fourier series due to\nthe periodicity of sinusoidal functions. Hence, the X function can be\nexpressed as a summation of the set of sine/cosine curves that satisfies the\ninitial condition.

Is the system in a (quasi) steady state or in a transient state?\n2. Define the boundary of the system.\n3. Which type of boundary conditions does the system have?\na. Constant concentration\nb. Constant flux\nc. Surface flux depends on surface concentration\n4. What is the initial condition? (esp. important in transient problems)\n5. What is the most appropriate coordinate system (Cartesian, cylindrical or\nspherical) for representing the physical system?\n\nIf the system is in a (quasi) steady state...\n6. Is there any reaction/production occurring within the boundary of the system?\n7. Can you write the mass or mole balance equation for the system (i.e. Flux in -\nFlux out + Reaction/Production = 0)?\n8. Can you express the mass/mole balance equation into a differential equation and\nthen solve it?\n9. Can you determine the integration constants with the boundary conditions\nidentified earlier?\n\nIf the system in a transient state...\n6. Can the system be approximated as having an infinite or semi-infinite\ndomain? If yes, until when is the solution valid?\n7. For systems with (semi-) infinite domain, does the initial concentration profile\nresemble that of a step function or a delta function?\n8. If the initial concentration profile resembles a delta function, does the \"point\nsource\" on the boundary changes with time or remains constant with time?\n9. For systems with finite domain, can an infinite domain solution be applied for\nsmall time t?\n10. If the Fourier series solution is needed, is it possible to modify the standard\nsquare wave solution given in class to correctly depict the actual system?\n11. In all cases, when will steady state be achieved?"

Disposable mold: Sand casting, expanded polystyrene process, investment casting\n2. Permanent mold: Gravity permanent mold casting, low pressure permanent mode\ncasting, high pressure die casting, squeeze casting\n3. Ingot casting\n\nIn certain applications such as aerospace components manufacturing, an acceptable\ncasting means very small grain size and porosity-free. Reason?\n1. Grain size: Hall-Petch relationship\n2. Porosity: Reduce UTS and elongation, increase brittleness, stress concentration\naround pores, assist in fatigue crack initiation and propagation.\n\nPores are formed by dissolved gas and shrinkage upon solidification\n\nMeasures in gas control:\n- Directional solidification\n- Vacuum degassing\n- Chemical combination\n- Gas purging, etc.\nDissolved gas alone is usually not the main problem unless having very high gas content\n(considering the surface energy to nucleate a gas bubble).\nShrinkage is the number one enemy in casting. How can we control shrinkage?\n\nCertain elements shrink less than others during solidification, so alloys made with these\nelements can reduce overall shrinkage (e.g. Al-Si). However, the extent of alloying is\nalways limited by concerns over mechanical properties. Therefore, shrinkage is the\nreality in the casting business. The designer of a casting mold must make sure that\nshrinkage does not occur within the final product. How would you design such as mold?\n\nThe basic idea is to have a reservoir of liquid metal (called riser) above the casting that\nsupplies the metal needed to fill the voids. The challenge now is to ensure the reservoir\nsolidifies last as well as making sure that path from the reservoir to the part in need is\nnever blocked.\n\nSand mold\n-\nassume uniform and constant temperature (Tm) in liquid and solid metal\n(heat is released during solidification); the surface of the mold has the\nsame temperature as the liquid metal\n-\nneed to find thickness of solid metal, M\n\nThe energy balance equation is:\nHeat flux through mold surface = Latent heat released during solidification\nH\ndt\ndM\nx\nT\nk\nH\ndt\ndV\nx\nT\nkA\nx\nx\n∆\n-\n=\n∂\n∂\n-\n∆\n-\n=\n∂\n∂\n-\n=\n=\nρ\nρ\n\nLooking at the temperature profile in the mold, it is obvious that T is an error function\nsolution (for now assume semi-infinite mold) with boundary conditions:\nm\no\nT\nx\nT\nT\nx\nT\n=\n=\n=\n-inf\n=\n)\n(\n;\n)\n(\n\nt\nT\nT\nx\nT\nt\nx\nerfc\nT\nT\nT\nT\no\nM\nx\no\nm\no\nπα\nα\n-\n=\n∂\n∂\n⎟⎟\n⎠\n⎞\n⎜⎜\n⎝\n⎛-\n-\n+\n=\n=0\n)\n(\n\nremember the chain rule term!\n\nPutting back into the energy balance equation\ndt\ndM\nH\nt\nT\nT\nk\no\nM\n∆\n-\n=\n-\n-\nρ\nπα\n\nInitial conditions: at t = 0, M = 0\n)\n(\nt\nH\nT\nT\nk\nM\no\nM\n∆\n-\n=\nρ\nπα\n\nTherefore to prevent the reservoir from solidifying prematurely, the minimum dimension\nof the riser can be estimated with the solidification time of the casting.\n\nWhat is the minimum dimension of the mold for the solution to be valid?\nt\nL\nL\nt\nα\nα\n>\n→\n<\n\nIs it sufficient to simply make the riser's dimension larger than the \"thickest\" section of\nthe product and avoid this calculation?\nNot always, because of the presence of hot spots within the mold and the casting.\n\nCan we just make a huge riser and forget about the calculation?\nYes you can, but your boss will not be happy. First, the riser even with the minimum\ndimension is usually large. Making it any larger unnecessarily means more waste of\nmetal and energy. Second, the larger the riser the more machining needed to be done\nafter casting to remove the riser.\n\nHow do we determine the solidification time?\nExperience, I guess.\n\nInvestment Casting\nIs the solution easier or harder?"

In the second case, the laboratory\nobserver sees no change in density with time because we specified that\n=\n∂\n∂\nt\nρ\n. The\nparticle also sees no change in density as it moves around because\n=\n∂\n∂\nx\nρ\n. Suppose we\nstill maintain the conservation of mass, but instead the density is a function of time, i.e.\n=\n∂\n∂\nt\nρ\n. For the laboratory observer, the density is changing with time. In order to satisfy\nthe conservation of mass and since there is no diffusion, the particle and the density\ngradient\nx\n∂\n∂ρ must be in a certain configuration. For example, let the density inside the\ndifferential element increases with time, then the\nproduct\nx\nux ∂\n∂ρ must be negative. For fluid/body moving\nin a positive x-direction, the density gradient must be\nnegative. Following the trajectory of the particle with\ntime (denoted by the vertical lines), it is shown here\nthat the density remains the same from the particle's\nframe of reference. Is this just a coincident?\nx\nρ\n\nHere's a quick demonstration.\n\nSuppose we take a very small differential element. As the particle enters the element, the\ndensity at x = x is at ρi,x and ρf,x is the density at x = x when the particle leaves the\nelement after time to. Clearly, the change in density with time is give by\no\nx\ni\nx\nf\nt\nt\n,\n,\nρ\nρ\nρ\n-\n≈\n∂\n∂\n. If the length of the differential element is ∆x, then the velocity of the\n\nparticle is\no\nx\nt\nx\nu\n∆\n=\n. According to the conservation equation derived earlier,\nx\nt\nx\nt\nx\nt\nu\nx\nx\nu\nt\nx\nf\nx\ni\no\nx\ni\nx\nf\no\nx\nx\n∆\n-\n=\n-\n∆\n-\n=\n∂\n∂\n∂\n∂\n-\n=\n∂\n∂\n∂\n∂\n-\n=\n∂\n∂\n,\n,\n,\n,\nρ\nρ\nρ\nρ\nρ\nρ\nρ\nρ\nρ\n\nρi,x\nx+∆x\nx\nρf,x\nAt time t = to, we know that the density at x = x is ρf,x, and we want to know the density\nat x = x+∆x. The slope of the density profile can also be written as\nx\nx\nx\nf\nx\nx\nf\n∆\n-\n≈\n∂\n∂\n∆\n+\n,\n,\nρ\nρ\nρ\n.\nComparing the last two equations, it is evident that ρf,x+∆x = ρi,x; therefore, the density is\nthe same from the particle's frame of reference. The above demonstration assumes a\nlinear density profile; however, it is conceptually straightforward that any curves can be\napproximated as linear when the differential element is sufficiently small. Hence, this\nshould be a rather general result and not a coincident. One last note...\n\nSince the substantial derivative of density is zero by conservation equation and we have\nshown that the change in density with time is also zero from the particle's frame of\nreference, it is therefore reasonable to think of the substantial derivative as the change in\ndensity with time from the particle's point of view.\n\nNow imagine the \"stuff\" for which the conservation of mass has been derived are actually\nlots of tiny carriers capable of carrying such quantities like energy, momentum or money.\nIf we assume the flow of these quantities is only possible through the tiny carriers, then\nwe can write a conservation equation that has such general forms:\n\nTotal accumulation = massin * amt carried per carrier - massout * amt carried per\ncarrier\n\nThis is a general conservation equation for moving body/fluid without any diffusive\ncomponent or body force. In the case of energy, the amount carried per carrier is given by\nthe enthalpy per mass and multiplying this with massin/massout gives the flux of enthalpy\ninto/out of the differential volume due to the migration of these tiny carriers.\n\nThe same is true for momentum. Since momentum is the product of mass and velocity,\nthe flux of momentum into/out of the differential element is given by the product of\nmassin/massout and velocity, u. Note that momentum flux has the same dimension as\nforce. Hence, the balance of momentum flux is also a force balance. It is important to\nremember both definitions when you are writing the differential equation for a fluid\nsystem. A typical force balance for a fluid element takes into account the following\ncontributions:\n\n- Rate of momentum in/out across surfaces on the side by momentum diffusion\n- Rate of momentum in/out across cross-sectional surface by convective transport\n- Pressure force acting on the cross-sectional surface\n- Body force such as gravity\n\nHappy Halloween!"

In this case, the change in velocity with\ntime can be considered as the acceleration felt by a particle. By Newton's law of\nmotion, acceleration in a body is caused by a non-zero net force, which is given by\nthe product of mass and acceleration. The left hand side of the momentum equation\nis a product of mass (per unit volume) and acceleration; therefore, it is reasonable to\nlook at the right hand side as a sum of forces acting on the particle in a fluid. Hence\nthe similarity in solution of the momentum balance and the Navier Stokes'\napproach is not surprising. In fact, the Navier Stokes' equation is derived using the\nmomentum balance approach for the general case. Recall from our discussion\nduring last recitation, a steady state flow, i.e.\n=\n∂\n∂\nt\nv\n, does not require the velocity\nto be constant with time from a particle's frame of reference as long as there is a\nnon-zero net force acting on the particle."
