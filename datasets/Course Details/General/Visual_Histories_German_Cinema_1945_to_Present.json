We will investigate how German cinema captured the atmosphere of the immediate post-war years and discuss extensively major works of the \"New German Cinema\" of the sixties and seventies. We will also look at examples of East Germany's film production and finally observe the very different roads German cinema has been taking from the 1990's into the present. The course has several objectives:\n\nto provide basic tools of film analysis which allow us to discuss questions like: How are movies constructed? How do we perceive films? How can we describe specific aesthetic qualities of a film?\n\nto present an introduction to the history of German cinematic production, to introduce the work of major film directors;\n\nto reflect on German film making as an artistic reaction and comment on German history;\n\nto draw on intercultural analyses to understand German cinema not only in its own terms, but also vis-a-vis the Hollywood cinematic tradition. In other words: what is so\ndifferent\nabout German Cinema, and how can we appreciate it precisely for the ways in which it veers from the \"dominant\" convention?\n\nOne meeting a week will be mostly taken up by first screenings and a brief discussion afterwards. Different short readings will give us additional material for discussion in our second meeting. Most films have to be watched a second time.\n\nThis class fulfills the requirements of a communication-intensive course. Therefore, we will focus especially on ways to improve our communication through presentations, discussions, and writing assignments.\n\nRequirements\n\nactive class participation contributes to 25% of final grade.\n\nreading assignments.\n\na 15 page film journal.\n\nan oral presentation contribute to 15% of final grade.\n\nthree papers (7 pages each), of which at least one has to be revised and resubmitted each contributes to 20% of final grade.\n\nReadings for this Course\n\nCorrigan, Timothy.\nA Short Guide to Writing About Film,\n4th ed. Essex: Pearson Longman, 2000.\n\nHake, Sabine.\nGerman National Cinema.\nNew York: Routledge, 2001.",
