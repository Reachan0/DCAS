  "syllabus_content": "Course Meeting Times\n\nLectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session\n\nScope of the Subject\n\nAn introductory subject which presents the main outlines of human evolution, both physical and cultural. The subject's scope encompasses our immediate pre-hominid ancestors of the Miocene, dating to between 6 and 22 million years ago, and all subsequent hominids including anatomically modern\nHomo sapiens\nwho first appear within the past 150,000 years. The class charts hominid evolution from savanna/woodland dwelling primates with a distribution in tropical Africa to modern humans whose mental abilities and complex technology have enabled them to colonize all corners of the world. The class includes a survey of the late Pleistocene human cultural adaptations which formed the basis for the subsequent development of agricultural and pastoral based economies and urbanization which are the hallmarks of many human societies of the past 10,000 years. The subject concludes with discussion of modern human morphological variation and races.\n\nThe subject integrates recent research in human palaeontology and archaeology to examine the interconnections between human physical and cultural development during the course of human evolution. Beginning with the Oligocene and Miocene primate substratum, the subject examines the five subsequent major stages of hominid evolution: 1) the earliest hominids (australopithecines), 2) the earliest\nHomo\n, 3)\nHomo erectus\n, 4)\nHomo heidelbergensis\nand\nneanderthalensis\n, and 5) modern\nHomo sapiens\n. For each stage a synopsis of the historical highlights of previous research will be presented, as will a description of the hard fossil evidence contributing to our knowledge of the hominid's physical form. The archaeological evidence for the cultural behavior (including symbolic behavior, subsistence patterns, and the level of technological capabilities) represented in each stage will be discussed using the format of mini-case studies using selected archaeological sites including Olduvai Gorge, East Turkana, Olorgesailie, Terra Amata, Dolni Vestonice and Abu Hureyra.\n\nBy the very nature of the fossil and archaeological record the detailed history of human evolution can never be certainly known, but it is the subject's aim to provide students with an appreciation of what is reliably known (the \"facts\") about human evolution, what must remain informed speculation, and what avenues still remain to be investigated.\n\nSubject Mechanics\n\nTwo meetings per week: a combination of lectures, discussions, and practical handling of fossil casts and artifactual materials.\n\nRequired work: includes a midterm exam, several short lab exercises, quizzes, two reading commentaries and two 4-5 page response papers, a group based presentation in class and a second midterm exam given during exam period.\n\nN.B.\nattendance at lectures and participation in the discussions will be considered in evaluating your performance in this class.\n\nOverall Weight of Assignments\n\nACTIVITIES\n\nPERCENTAGES\n\nReading Response - Waal and Mitani\net al\nPapers (3 Pages)\n\n6%\n\nOsteology Quiz\n\n5%\n\nEarly Hominid Variation Discussion\n\n12%\n\nIsaac / Lovejoy / Bingham Reading Discussion (4-5 Pages)\n\n11%\n\nFirst Midterm Examination\n\n22%\n\nShipman\net al\nReading - Logic Evaluation - 1 Page Outline\n\n4%\n\nBinford - Mousterian Critique (4-5 Pages)\n\n11%\n\nReading Response - Diamond / Molleson Papers (3 Pages)\n\n6%\n\nSecond Midterm Examination (Exam Period)\n\n23%\n\nCalendar\n\nSES #\n\nTOPICS\n\n1-2\n\nIntroduction: The Search for Human Ancestors, Approaches to the Study of Human Evolution and an Introduction to Human Osteology\n\n3-4\n\nEvolutionary Processes and Time Scales\n\nModern Primates and Their Relevance to Understanding Human Origins\n\nTertiary Higher Primates: Our Pre-Hominid Predecessors\n\n7-8\n\nEarliest Hominids: The Australopithecines and Affines\n\nEarly Hominids - Variations and Taxonomy - Presentations\n\nHominid / Human Origins: Hypotheses and Speculation\n\nEarly\nHomo\n: How Should\nHomo\nBe Defined?\n\n12-13\n\nThe Archaeology of the Early Hominids I: Olduvai Gorge and Koobi Fora\n\nThe Archaeology of the Early Hominids II: Interpreting Early Hominid Behavior and Current Research Directions\n\nMidterm Exam\n\nHomo ergaster\nand\nerectus\n: Emerging Modern Morphology\n\nSlowly Emerging Modern Behaviors: Early Stone Age / Lower Palaeolithic Age\n\nHomo heidelbergensis\nand\nneanderthalensis\nor Early \"Archaic\"\nH. sapiens\n?\n\n19-20\n\n\"Archaics\": Not Quite Us Physically, Not Quite Us Mentally\n\nOrigin of Modern\nHomo sapiens\n: Morphology and Genetic Evidence\n\n22-23\n\nModern\nHomo sapiens\nI: Cultural Diversity Becomes the Norm\n\nModern\nHomo sapiens\nII: To the Threshold of Civilization\n\n25-26\n\nModern Human Diversity: Distribution, Morphological Variation and \"Races\"",

      "content": "------------------------\n3.987\n-\nHuman Origins and Evolution\nSpring, 2006\n\"Discussion\" project: Early hominid (hominin) variation and species identification\nBackground:\nOver the past three decades an increasing number of early hominid and putative early hominid fossils\nhave been found in northern and eastern Africa. These fossils range between 7.0 and 1.75 million years ago.\nMoreover, there has been a proliferation of new names to describe these fossils. Some of these new taxa of\naustralopithecines include:\nmajor issues of controversy\nAustralopithecus afarensis\nhomogeneity of specimens referred to the taxa\nAustralopithecus anamensis\ndifference from A. afarensis and other australopiths\nAustralopithecus garhi\ndifference from all other australopiths\nAustralopithecus bahrelghazali\ndifference from A. afarensis\nKenyanthropus platyops\nvalidity of genus and difference from all other australopiths\nParanthropus aethiopicus (aka Australopithecus) differences between one another\nParanthropus boisei\nArdipithecus ramidus\ndifferences from A afarenis and one another\nArdipithecus kadabba\nSahelanthropus tchadensis\nevidence for status as hominid\nOrrorin tugenensis\nevidence for status as hominid\nThe issues are, to what extent are these taxa actually different from one another, and is the\nestablishment of so many separate species either justified or useful? What are the researchers trying to\naccomplish by naming new genera and species?\nIn this particular case we are going to examine the Paranthropus taxa. Notice too that many\nresearchers do not recognize Paranthropus as a distinct genus here, but call it Australopithecus.\nFor your short paper compile a table which lists the diagnostic features which are said to distinguish\nthe taxa boisei and aethiopicus. (Appendix III in your textbook is great for this purpose.) Whenever\npossible also include those basic features which distinguish the taxa from panids (chimps) as well as those\nfeatures which distinguish it from the other early hominids. (This may also require you to check the\ndescriptions of some of the other hominids - see Asfaw et al. 1999 for such a list.) Write a commentary\nwhich considers generally what the problems may be in recognizing fossil genera and species in human\npalaeontology. Consider whether recognition of this particular genus and these two species seems justified,\n(both by definition and by amount of material) and separated enough in time and space to be useful in\npalaeoanthropological research. Limit your discussion to 4 (double spaced) pages, plus your table.\nDue:\nMarch 8\nP.T.O.\n\nReferences for the early hominid variability discussion\nFor a general reference and discussion see your textbook.\nCampbell, B.G., J.D.

Then write a 4-5 page (double spaced) paper in\nresponse to these readings. (Remember to reference your sources and please do not exceed 7 pages.) Please\nthink about and address the following issues and questions in your paper.\nHumans in general, tend to look for simple, single causal explanations of the complex phenomena\naround them. Certainly there has been no dearth of this type of explanation in palaeoanthropology.\nHistorically, numerous single factors have been cited as the primary or triggering force behind the origins of\nhominids and of humans, even if a somewhat more integrated multi-factor approach has gradually emerged\nrecently. The papers by Bingham, Isaac, and Lovejoy represent some of the more recent views and arguments\nconcerning \"human\" origins. Lovejoy deals largely with the origin of hominids and bipedalism in the 7 - 4\nmyr. time range. Isaac and Bingham with the origins of larger brained modern humans, essentially post -2.5\nmyr.\n1)\nBriefly review the central points of each model, paying close attention to what types of evidence and\narguments are used to support the models. To what extent are the models in marked opposition and to\nwhat extent are they complementary?\n2)\nHow would you go about testing the data and assumptions in each of these models? Can you suggest\nany such tests or predictions? Can such models be tested scientifically?\n3)\nDoes any one of these models seem particularly compelling to explain why either hominids or larger\nbrained humans evolved in the directions they did? And if so, why? For the others what seems to be\ntheir principal weaknesses.\nFor additional ideas and views, read Chapter 9 of either the 9th or 8th ed. of the text for Campbell and Loy's\ndiscussion of the ideas presented in Lovejoy and Isaac.\nReadings:\nBingham, P.M. 2000.

Please\nthink about and address the following issues and questions in your paper.\nHumans in general, tend to look for simple, single causal explanations of the complex phenomena\naround them. Certainly there has been no dearth of this type of \"explanation\" in palaeoanthropology.\nHistorically, numerous single factors have been cited as the primary or triggering force behind the origins of\nhominins and of humans, even if a somewhat more cautious and nuanced multi-factor approach has gradually\nemerged recently.

[Chapters 14 and 15 in Humankind Emerging (8th ed)] for\nbackground information on later Middle Pleistocene and early Upper Pleistocene hominids. In the past many\nresearchers (the lumpers) have considered them generally as \"archaic\" H. sapiens. The splitters, including Campbell\net al., see them as representing multiple species, variously classified as H. antecessor, H. heidelbergensis, H.\nneanderthalensis and H. sapiens (although the known scant fossil record for the last only begins about 120,000 years\nago).\nDespite the splitters' view that Neandertals represent a separate species, the absence of a significant\narchaeological record for the earliest H. sapiens (before about 50,000 years ago), encourages many researchers to view\nNeandertal behavior, for which we have a pretty good record, as prototypic of early modern sapiens behaviors.\nCampbell et al.'s view is typical of the consensus view. In sharp contrast are the views of archaeologist Lewis\nBinford, presented in the journal article by Fischman referenced below. Binford postulates a very distinctive\n?hunting? and gathering adaptation for Neandertals based on a gender based division of labor (or lack thereof).\nAfter reflecting on the behaviors of the very large brained Neandertals that Campbell et al. describe, prepare\na 4 page (double spaced) paper in response to Campbell and Loy's and Binford's discrepant views. Please think\nabout and address the following issues in your paper. What are the Neandertal behaviors that still appear archaic, and\nwhich appear to verge on modernity and may likely have been shared with early modern Homo sapiens? What kind\nof adaptation is Binford proposing? In view of Isaac's and Lovejoy's arguments that food sharing and provisioning\nexist much earlier, not to mention Bingham's view that large brains reflect complex coalitions!, how reasonable do\nyou think Binford's arguments about Neandertal social and economic behaviors may be? Can you think of\nalternative behavioral patterns that Neandertals might have exhibited that could have created the patterning in the\nartifacts and bones that Binford observed in the Combe Grenal sites?\nReadings:\nFischman, J. 1992.\nHard Evidence.

Well here it is.\nAs I mentioned one of the really interesting recent discoveries is that there may have been another genus of now\nextinct apes which independently developed bipedalism. The candidate is Oreopithecus a 9 to 7 million year old\ngenus of European ape, however, your textbook authors don't provide any real discussion of this evidence or this\npossibility. The genus Oreopithecus has been recognized for over 130 years, it being one of the first fossil apes to be\ndiscovered and described. Below are several references and abstracts of relatively recent papers which have reanalyzed\nthe Oreopithecus remains and have somewhat controversially proposed that Oreopithecus was a habitual biped. It is\nclear that even if Oreopithecus turns out to be a biped, other physical features strongly suggest that it wasn't in the\nancestral lineage leading to humans.\nKohler, Meike and Salvador Moya-Sola\nApe-like or hominid-like? The positional behavior of Oreopithecus bambolii reconsidered.\nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA Vol. 94, pp. 11747-11750, October 1997.\nAbstract: Comparative morphological and functional analyses of the skeletal remains of Oreopithecus bambolii, a\nhominoid from the Miocene Mediterranean island of Tuscany-Sardinia (Italy), provides evidence that bipedal activities\nmade up a significant part of the positional behavior of this primate. The mosaic pattern of its postcranial morphology is\nto some degree convergent with that of Australopithecus and functionally intermediate between apes and early hominids.\nSome unique traits could have been selected only under insular conditions where the absence of predators and the\nlimitation of trophic resources play a crucial role in mammalian evolution.\nRook, Lorenzo, Luca Bondioli, Meike Kohler, Salvador Moya-Sola and Roberto Macchiarelli\nOreopithecus was a bipedal ape after all: evidence from the iliac cancellous architecture.\nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA Vol. 96, Issue 15, 8795-8799, July 20, 1999.\nAbstract: Textural properties and functional morphology of the hip bone cancellous network of Oreopithecus bambolii, a\n9- to 7-million-year-old Late Miocene hominoid from Italy, provide insights into the postural and locomotor behavior of\nthis fossil ape. Digital image processing of calibrated hip bone radiographs reveals the occurrence of trabecular features,\nwhich, in humans and fossil hominids, are related to vertical support of the body weight, i.e., to bipedality.\nMoya-Sola, Salvador, Meike Kohler and Lorenzo Rook\nEvidence of hominid-like precision grip capability in the hand of the Miocene ape Oreopithecus.\nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA Vol. 96, Issue 1, 313-317, January 5, 1999.\nAbstract: Functional and allometric analyses of the hand of the late Miocene ape Oreopithecus bambolii (Tuscany,\nItaly) reveal a series of features that reflect an improved grasping capability including firm pad-to-pad precision\ngripping that apes are unable to perform. Related features such as hand length, relative thumb length, a deep and large\ninsertion area for the tendon of the long thumb flexor, and the form of the metacarpal 2/capitate articulation are not\npresent in extant or fossil apes. In these features, the Oreopithecus hand closely matches the pattern of early hominids,\npresumably as a response to similar functional demands.\nFYI #2 - more about hominid tooth formation than you probably wanted to know\nDate: 3/8/06\nI think an important part of your education in 3.987 should be for you to be aware of some of the amazing \"high tech\"\nstudies that have been undertaken recently in palaeoanthropology, even if we don't manage to discuss them in detail in\nlecture and your text barely mentions them.\nRemember on Monday I mentioned the age of the Taung australopithecine child at death and it's dental developmental\nsequence, the following article and abstract is a follow up. - The paper referenced below has a good general description\nof the technique of analyzing daily enamel formation increments, although it deals specifically with determining the\nages of two more recent Homo erectus individuals.\n\n--------------------------\n--------------------------\nThe paper dealing directly with the Taung child is by Bromage, T.G. and Dean, M.C. 1985, Re-evaluation of the age at\ndeath of immature fossil hominids. Nature 317:525-527.\nThe following is an elegant analytical study.\nDean, C., M.G. Leakey, D. Reid, F. Schrenk, G.T. Schwartz, C. Stringer & A. Walker.\nGrowth processes in teeth distinguish modern humans from Homo erectus and earlier hominins.\nNature 414:628-631.\nAbstract: A modern human-like sequence of dental development, as a proxy for the pace of life history, is regarded as\none of the diagnostic hallmarks of our own genus Homo. Brain size, age at first reproduction, lifespan and other life-\nhistory traits correlate tightly with dental development . Here we report differences in enamel growth that show the\nearliest fossils attributed to Homo do not resemble modern humans in their development. We used daily incremental\nmarkings in enamel to calculate rates of enamel formation in 13 fossil hominins and identified differences in this key\ndeterminant of tooth formation time. Neither australopiths nor fossils currently attributed to early Homo shared the slow\ntrajectory of enamel growth typical of modern humans; rather, both resembled modern and fossil African apes. We then\nreconstructed tooth formation times in australopiths, in the,1.5-Myr old Homo erectus skeleton from Nariokotome,\nKenya, and in another Homo erectus specimen, Sangiran S7-37 from Java. These times were shorter than those in\nmodern humans. It therefore seems likely that truly modern dental development emerged relatively late in human\nevolution.\nFYI #4 - The gluteus maximus\nDate: 3/20/06\nThis is a definite read! There's a news commentary , 'Faster Than a Hyena? Running May Make Humans Special' by\nCarl Zimmer in Science 306:1283 (19 Nov. 2004) that deals with recent research on the possible connections\nbetween the emergence of striding gait bipedalism, long distance endurance running and hunting. But more to your\nnext assignment - when you get around to evaluating Bingham's view of the role of the gluteus maximus muscle in\nhuman evolution, you might want to consider other possible functions for it, as reported herein. In fairness to\nBingham, he wrote in 2000 relying on older research, and this more detailed study came out in 2004.\nThe original article by Bramble and Lieberman which deals with their view of early hominid locomotion is:\nBramble, D.M. & D.E. Lieberman\nEndurance running and the evolution of Homo. Nature 432:345-352.\nAbstract: Striding bipedalism is a key derived behaviour of hominids that possibly originated soon after the divergence\nof the chimpanzee and human lineages. Although bipedal gaits include walking and running, running is generally\nconsidered to have played no major role in human evolution because humans, like apes, are poor sprinters compared to\nmost quadrupeds. Here we assess how well humans perform at sustained long-distance running, and review the\nphysiological and anatomical bases of endurance running capabilities in humans and other mammals. Judged by several\ncriteria, humans perform remarkably well at endurance running, thanks to a diverse array of features, many of which\nleave traces in the skeleton. The fossil evidence of these features suggests that endurance running is a derived capability\nof the genus Homo, originating about 2 million years ago, and may have been instrumental in the evolution of the human\nbody form.\n\n--------------------------\nFYI #5 - On the diet of australopithecines\nDate: 3/2006\nMore palaeoanthropological spam. We got into a discussion of the possibility of using isotopes to investigate diet\nsimilarity and food sharing in Isaac's Lower Pleistocene sites. While practically that would be a very long shot due to a\nlack of skeletal material, I mentioned it has been possible to look at diet of the australopithecines and paranthropines\nin southern Africa.\nIn recent years it has sometimes become possible to study the isotopic ratios of carbon, nitrogen and strontium in\nancient bone and teeth. This allows researchers to determine the types of plants and animals that may have been eaten\nby these creatures. References to three such studies of South African australopithecines and their diets are below. -\nObviously all of the australopithecines seem to have had fairly nutritious, widely variable, and potentially omnivorous\ndiets.\nSponheimer, Matt and Julia A. Lee-Thorp\nIsotopic evidence for the diet of an early hominid, Australopithecus africanus.\nScience 283:368-70\nAbstract: Current consensus holds that the 3-million-year-old hominid Australopithecus africanus subsisted on fruits and\nleaves, much as the modern chimpanzee does. Stable carbon isotope analysis of A. africanus from Makapansgat\nLimeworks, South Africa, demonstrates that this early hominid ate not only fruits and leaves but also large quantities of\ncarbon-13- enriched foods such as grasses and sedges or animals that ate these plants, or both. The results suggest that\nearly hominids regularly exploited relatively open environments such as woodlands or grasslands for food. They may\nalso suggest that hominids consumed high-quality animal foods before the development of stone tools and the origin of the\ngenus Homo.\nvan der Merwe, N.J., J. F. Thackeray, J. A. Lee-Thorp and J. Luyt\nThe carbon isotope ecology and diet of Australopithecus africanus at Sterkfontein, South Africa.\nJournal of Human Evolution 44 :581-597.\nAbstract: The stable carbon isotope ratio of fossil tooth enamel carbonate is determined by the photosynthetic systems of\nplants at the base of the animal's foodweb. In subtropical Africa, grasses and many sedges have C4 photosynthesis and\ntransmit their characteristically enriched 13C/12C ratios (more positive 13C values) along the foodchain to consumers.\nWe report here a carbon isotope study of ten specimens of Australopithecus africanus from Member 4, Sterkfontein (ca.\n2.5 to 2.0 Ma), compared with other fossil mammals from the same deposit. This is the most extensive isotopic study of an\nearly hominin species that has been achieved so far. The results show that this hominin was intensively engaged with the\nsavanna foodweb and that the dietary variation between individuals was more pronounced than for any other early\nhominin or non-human primate species on record. Suggestions that more than one species have been included in this\ntaxon are not supported by the isotopic evidence. We conclude that Australopithecus africanus was highly opportunistic\nand adaptable in its feeding habits.\nLee-Thorp, Julia A., van der Merwe, N.J. and C.K. Brain\nDiet of Australopithecus robustus at Swartkrans from stable carbon isotopic analysis.\nJournal of Human Evolution 27:361-372.\nAbstract:\nDietary adaptations of early hominids are generally understood to have played a crucial role in hominid\nevolution. The dietary habits of Australopithecus robustus are of special interest because the robust masticatory\napparatus and characteristic dental features point to a distinctive dietary niche. Suggestions have ranged anywhere\nbetween carnivory and specialist herbivory, but current consensus has focused mainly on small hard items within the\ncontest of a vegetarian diet, and more particularly, frugivory. Few studies have challenged this perspective, although the\nresults of a recent Sr/Ca study of A. robustus ar Swartkrans were found to be inconsistent with herbivory. ----- Results\nfor A. robustus, compared with other fauna from Swartkrans, show a mixed diet including both C3 and C4 foods. Since\nthe C4 contribution must derive from consumption of grass or grazing animals, the data do not support either a specialist\nfrugivorous or graminivorous niche for A. robustus, rather, they suggest a more generalized or omnivorous diet.\n\n--------------------------\n--------------------------\nFYI #6 - on early stone tool use\nDate: 3/ 22 /06\nLike you didn't have enough to read or do. More palaeoanthropological spam. Following up on the issue of visibility\nof early stone tool use, you might want to refer to the paper below for a discussion of possible behavioral changes that\nmight have triggered the appearance of discernible \"archaeological sites\" around 2.6 myr.\nPanger, M.A., A.S. Brooks, B.G. Richmond and B. Wood\nOlder than the Oldowan? rethinking the emergence of hominin tool use.\nEvolutionary Anthropology 11:235-245.\nAbstract: Intentionally modified stone tools first appear in the hominin archeological record about 2.5 mya. Their\nappearance has been variously interpreted as marking the onset of tool use by hominins or, less restrictively, the origin of\nhominin lithic technology. Although the 2.5 mya date has persisted for two decades, several related but distinct questions\nabout the origin and evolution of hominin tool use remain to be answered: Did hominins use tools before 2.5 mya? Did\nhominins use unmodified stones as tools before 2.5 mya? Does the earliest appearance of stone tools in the archeological\nrecord represent the earliest use of intentionally modified stones as tools?\nFYI #7 - headstrong hominids\nDate: 4/12/06\nTry this URL for an interesting discussion of skull thickness and Homo erectus behavior. If this is all about male\ncompetition, why are female skulls so thick too?\nhttp://www.naturalhistorymag.com/0204/0204_feature.html\n\n--------------------------\nFYI #9 - Tan-Tan Acheulian figurine\nDate: 4/25/06\nI threatened you with some palaeoanthropological spam yesterday. Here are illustrations of the only other known\npossible figurine of Acheulian age . It comes from the Tan-Tan Acheulian site in Morocco. The original article which\ndescribes this find and its setting is:\nBednarik, R.G.\nA figurine from the African Acheulian.

Here's an image and close-up of the point of one of the three spruce spears from\nthe Schoningen site in Germany. According to the textbook this may be a product of H. heidelbergensis.\nThe\noriginal article is:\nThieme, H.\nLower Palaeolithic hunting spears from Germany.\nNature 385:807-810.\nImage removed due to copyright restrictions.\nThe photograph showed spear II, which is 2.30m long. The spear was shown at the left of an incomplete horse pelvis,\nwith the base broken off.\n\n--------------------------\n--------------------------\nFYI #11 - The role of cooking in human evolution\nDate: 4/26/06\nYet more cooked (?) spam. There is an extremely interesting article by Wrangham and Conklin-Brittain on the role of\ncooking in human evolution, that argues, given the human gut length,dentition and the nutritional value of raw food,\nthat cooking has to have been an important evolutionary factor from the time of the emergence of Homo\nerectus/ergaster. They basically argue that there wasn't time enough in a day to chew and digest enough food to support\nthe large body size of erectus without cooking. The abstract of the article is below.\nWrangham, R. and N.L. Conklin-Brittain\n'Cooking as a biological trait'.\nComparative Biochemistry and Physiology Part A 136 (2003) 35-46.\nAbstract: No human foragers have been recorded as living without cooking, and people who choose a 'raw-foodist' life\nstyle experience low energy and impaired reproductive function. This suggests that cooking may be obligatory for\nhumans. The possibility that cooking is obligatory is supported by calculations suggesting that a diet of raw food could not\nsupply sufficient calories for a normal hunter-gatherer lifestyle. In particular, many plant foods are too fiber-rich when\nraw, while most raw meat appears too tough to allow easy chewing. If cooking is indeed obligatory for humans but not\nfor other apes, this means that human biology must have adapted to the ingestion of cooked food (i.e. food that is tender\nand low in fiber) in ways that no longer allow efficient processing of raw foods. Cooking has been practiced for ample\ntime to allow the evolution of such adaptations. Digestive adaptations have not been investigated in detail but may include\nsmall teeth, small hind-guts, large small intestines, a fast gut passage rate, and possibly reduced ability to detoxify. The\nadoption of cooking can also be expected to have had far-reaching effects on such aspects of human biology as life-\nhistory, social behavior, and evolutionary psychology. Since dietary adaptations are central to understanding species\nevolution, cooking appears to have been a key feature of the environment of human evolutionary adaptedness. Further\ninvestigation is therefore needed of the ways in which human digestive physiology is constrained by the need for food of\nrelatively high caloric density compared to other great apes\nFYI #12 - Early sapiens mtDNA in Australia\nDate: 5/1/06\nThe paper below reports the occurrence of an archaic mtDNA pattern among early Australians. The implication being\nperhaps that early H.s.s populations may have had a more complex geographic origin than that suggested by the 'out\nof Africa' scenario.\nAdcock, G.J., E.S. Dennis, S. Easteal, G.A. Huttley, L.S. Jermiin, W.J. Peacock and A. Thorne.\nMitochondrial DNA sequences in ancient Australians: Implications for modern human origins.\nProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA 98(2):537-542.\nAbstract: DNA from ancient human remains provides perspectives on the origin of our species and the relationship\nbetween molecular and morphological variation. We report analysis of mtDNA from the remains of 10 ancient\nAustralians. These include the morphologically gracile Lake Mungo 3 ['60 thousand years (ka) before present] and\nthree other gracile individuals from Holocene deposits at Willandra Lakes (<10 ka), all within the skeletal range of\nliving Australians, and six Pleistocene/early Holocene individuals (15 to <8 ka) from Kow Swamp with robust\nmorphologies outside the skeletal range of contemporary indigenous Australians.\nLake Mungo 3 is the oldest\n(Pleistocene) ''anatomically modern'' human from whom DNA has been recovered. His mtDNA belonged to a lineage\nthat only survives as a segment inserted into chromosome 11 of the nuclear genome, which is now widespread among\nhuman populations. This lineage probably diverged before the most recent common ancestor of contemporary human\nmitochondrial genomes. This timing of divergence implies that the deepest known mtDNA lineage from an anatomically\nmodern human occurred in Australia; analysis restricted to living humans places the deepest branches in East Africa.\nThe other ancient Australian individuals we examined have mtDNA sequences descended from the most recent common\nancestor of living humans. Our results indicate that anatomically modern humans were present in Australia before the\ncomplete fixation of the mtDNA lineage now found in all living people. Sequences from additional ancient humans may\nfurther challenge current concepts of modern human origins.\n\nFYI #13 - possible Neandertal/sapiens hybrid?\nDate: 5/1/06\nI mentioned the Abrigo do Lagar Velho skeleton today. Here's the abstract and an illustration of the burial. At 24,500\nbp, it is one of the earlier burials of H. s. s. known in westernmost Europe. It's attribution as a result of long term\ngenetic admixture between Neandertals and H.s.s. controversial.\nDuarte, C., J. Maurice, P.B. Petite, P. Soot, E. Trunks, H. Van Deer Plight, and J. Zilhao\nThe early Upper Paleolithic human skeleton from the Abrigo do Lagar Velho (Portugal) and modern\nhuman emergence in Iberia.\nProceeding of the National Academy of Sciences USA 96:7604-7609.\nAbstract: The discovery of an early Upper Paleolithic human burial at the Abrigo do Lagar Velho, Portugal, has\nprovided evidence of early modern humans from southern Iberia. The remains, the largely complete skeleton of a '4\nyear-old child buried with pierced shell and red ochre, is dated to ca. 24,500 years B.B. The cranium, mandible, dentition,\nand post crania present a mosaic of European early modern human and Neandertal features. The temporal bone has an\nintermediate-sized juxtamastoid eminence. The mandibular mentum osseum and the dental size and proportions,\nsupported by mandibular ramal features, radial tuberosity orientation, and diaphyseal curvature, as well as the pubic\nproportions align the skeleton with early modern humans. Body proportions, reflected in femorotibial lengths and\ndiaphyseal robusticity plus tibial condylar displacement, as well as mandibular symphyseal retreat and thoracohumeral\nmuscle insertions, align the skeleton with the Neandertals. This morphological mosaic indicates admixture between\nregional Neandertals and early modern humans dispersing into southern Iberia. It establishes the complexities of the Late\nPleistocene emergence of modern humans and refutes strict replacement models of modern human origins\n\nImage removed due to copyright restrictions.\n\nThe photograph showed Lagar Velho 1 in situ, with damaged skull and left forearm elements already removed.\n\nFYI #14 - Neandertal mobility patterns\nDate: 5/1/06\nOn the issue of Neandertal mobility patterns. There is a really elegant piece of research by Lieberman and Shea\n(abstract below) that examines the problem. It used a really novel technique of studying cementum increments on\ngazelle tooth roots to determine the season of death of the animals found in the sites. The abstract of the paper\npresenting this research is below, as is an illustration of the two basic residential mobility patterns for\nhunter/gatherers. - The Neandertals are thought to practice the one on the right, radiating, while our ancestors are\nthought to have practiced the circulating pattern on the left.\nLieberman, D. and Shea, J.J.\nBehavioral differences between archaic and modern humans in the Levantine Mousterian.\nAmerican Anthropologist 96(2):300-332.\nAbstract: Early modern and archaic humans are associated with similar lithic industries in the Middle Paleolithic of the\nsouthern Levant, but new data suggest that they used the environment in different ways. Evidence from analyses of\nseasonally deposited increments of the teeth of the animals they hunted suggests that modern humans primarily practiced\na strategy of circulating seasonal mobility, while archaic humans in the same region 30,000 years later were more\nresidentially mobile. Analyses of their lithic hunting technology further suggest that archaic humans hunted more\nfrequently than did modern humans.

The occurrence of\nanatomic variants in all three skeletons gave rise to speculations that the buried individuals may have been closely\nrelated. To test this hypothesis the skeletons were submitted to a systematic kinship analysis based on odontologic and\nother non-metric traits. Statistical tests showed that the coincident occurrence of several rare traits in the individuals is\nhighly unlikely to occur at random. This and further data included in the analysis therefore suggest that the three\nindividuals buried together were genetically related and actually belonged\nto one family.\nImage removed due to copyright restrictions.\nThe photograph showed the upper palaeolithic triple burial that was discovered in the Pavlov hills above the village\nof Dolni Vestonice, Moravia, Czech Republic.

Merrick\"\nSubject: 3.987 FYI #1 - Oreopithecus\n\nHi folks,\n\nI threatened you with some spam about Oreopithecus, a possible Miocene bipedal\nape. Well here it is.\n\nAs I mentioned one of the really interesting recent discoveries is that there\nmay have been another genus of now extinct apes which independently developed\nbipedalism. The candidate is Oreopithecus a 9 to 7 million year old genus of\nEuropean apes, however, your textbook authors don't provide any real discussion\nof this evidence or this possibility. The genus Oreopithecus has been\nrecognized for over 130 years, it being one of the first fossil apes to be\ndiscovered and described. Below are several references and abstracts of\nrelatively recent papers which have reanalyzed the Oreopithecus remains and\nhave somewhat controversially proposed that Oreopithecus was a habitual biped.\nIt is clear that even if Oreopithecus turns out to be a biped, other physical\nfeatures strongly suggest that it wasn't in the ancestral lineage leading to\nhumans.\n\nH. Merrick\n\n------------\n\nKohler, Meike and Salvador Moya-Sola\n\nApe-like or hominid-like? The positional behavior of Oreopithecus bambolii\n\nreconsidered.\n\nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA Vol. 94, pp. 11747-11750, October 1997\nAbstract:\n\nComparative morphological and functional analyses of the skeletal remains of Oreopithecus\nbambolii, a hominoid from the Miocene Mediterranean island of Tuscany-Sardinia (Italy), provides evidence\nthat bipedal activities made up a significant part of the positional behavior of this primate. The mosaic\npattern of its postcranial morphology is to some degree convergent with that of Australopithecus and\nfunctionally intermediate between apes and early hominids. Some unique traits could have been selected\nonly under insular conditions where the absence of predators and the limitation of trophic resources play a\ncrucial role in mammalian evolution.\n\nRook, Lorenzo, Luca Bondioli, Meike Kohler, Salvador Moya-Sola and Roberto Macchiarelli\n\nOreopithecus was a bipedal ape after all: Evidence from the iliac cancellous\n\narchitecture.\n\nProc.

Digital image processing of calibrated hip bone radiographs reveals the\noccurrence of trabecular features, which, in humans and fossil hominids, are related to vertical support of\nthe body weight, i.e., to bipedality.\n\nMoya-Sola, Salvador, Meike Kohler and Lorenzo Rook\n\nEvidence of hominid-like precision grip capability in the hand of the Miocene ape\n\nOreopithecus.\n\nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Related features such as hand length, relative\nthumb length, a deep and large insertion area for the tendon of the long thumb flexor, and the form of the\nmetacarpal 2/capitate articulation are not present in extant or fossil apes. In these features, the\nOreopithecus hand closely matches the pattern of early hominids, presumably as a response to similar\nfunctional demands."

Merrick\"\nSubject: 3.987 - FYI #2 - more about hominid tooth formation than you\nprobably wanted to know\n\nHi,\n\nI think an important part of your education in 3.987 should be for you to be\naware of some of the amazing \"high tech\" studies that have been undertaken in\npalaeoanthropology, even if we don't manage to discuss them in detail in\nlecture and your text barely mentions them.\n\nRemember on Monday I mentioned the age of the Taung australopithecine child at\ndeath and it's dental developmental sequence, the following article and\nabstract is a follow up. - This paper has a good general description of the\ntechnique of analyzing daily enamel formation increments, although it deals\nspecifically with determining the ages of two more recent Homo erectus\nindividuals.\n\nThe paper dealing directly with the Taung child is by Bromage, T.G. and Dean,\nM.C. 1985, Re-evaluation of the age at death of immature fossil hominids.\nNature 317:525-527.\n\nHM.\n\nThe following is an elegant analytical study.\n\n-----------------------------\nDean, Christopher, Meave G.

Brain size, age at first reproduction,\nlifespan and other life-history traits correlate tightly with dental development . Here we report differences in\nenamel growth that show the earliest fossils attributed to Homo do not resemble modern humans in their\ndevelopment. We used daily incremental markings in enamel to calculate rates of enamel formation in 13\nfossil hominins and identified differences in this key determinant of tooth formation time. Neither\naustralopiths nor fossils currently attributed to early Homo shared the slow trajectory of enamel growth\ntypical of modern humans; rather, both resembled modern and fossil African apes. We then reconstructed\ntooth formation times in australopiths, in the,1.5-Myr old Homo erectus skeleton from Nariokotome, Kenya,\nand in another Homo erectus specimen, Sangiran S7-37 from Java. These times were shorter than those in\nmodern humans. It therefore seems likely that truly modern dental development emerged relatively late in\nhuman evolution."

Recent discoveries in a broad range of disciplines have raised important\nquestions about the influence of ecological factors in early human evolution. Here we trace the cranial and dental\ntraits of the early australopithecines through time, to show that between 4.4 million and 2.3 million years ago, the\ndietary capabilities of the earliest hominids changed dramatically, leaving them well suited for life in a variety of\nhabitats and able to cope with significant changes in resource availability associated with long-term and short-term\nclimatic fluctuations.\n) Foraging postures - Recently Jonathan Kingdon (2003) in Lowly Origin suggests that bipedalism\narises as a condition from preadaptations evolved among Miocene \"squat feeding ground apes\".\nFeatures such as stable flexed leg, broad pelvis, flexible waist, vertical spine, good head balance and\nmobile shoulders evolve before bipedalism.\n)\nHabitat Variability/Instability -\nR.
