This course has four central themes: (1) How to think analytically about designing organizational systems, (2) How leaders, especially founders, play a critical role in shaping an organization's culture, (3) What really needs to be done to build a successful organization for the long-term; and (4) What you can do to improve your personal likelihood of success.\n\nThis is not a survey course in entrepreneurship or in leadership. Instead, this course addresses the principles of organizational architecture, group behavior and performance, interpersonal influence, leadership and motivation in entrepreneurial settings. A primary goal is to develop your competencies in organizational design, human resources management, leadership and organizational behavior in the context of a new, small firm.\n\nFor many entrepreneurs, the most pressing questions (aside from those about financing) are about how to locate and recruit talented people, and how to manage and keep them, and how to build a high-growth, long-term, sustainable firm. This course will address these questions and will provide you with a number of critical concepts and competencies that will be useful to you in both the short and long term. Throughout the course there will be a dual emphasis on thinking systematically and strategically about aspects of managing a rapidly growing organization, and on the actual implementation challenges associated with management and leadership.\n\nThe primary course material will be a series of cases illustrating both successes and failures. You will also be provided with supplementary readings and lectures that will supply concepts and frameworks. It is important that we take advantage of the experience of class members. So, where relevant, please feel free to bring your own experiences and illustrations into class discussion. Throughout the course-virtually in every session-we will consider how what we are discussing differs across settings. Students with global experiences are especially encouraged to bring this knowledge into the classroom. The employment relationship in the U.S. is different in many respects from many other countries, so it is important that as managers we appreciate these differences in how human resources might be framed differently in other cultures. If we are to meet our goal of increasing your effectiveness in leading and managing, it is important to explore how, why, and under what circumstances various approaches work. Your previous experience, both positive and negative, is a valuable source of data for this learning.\n\nThe course is organized into three main modules: Setting Direction, Building Skills & Capabilities, and Sustaining Momentum. In each module there will be a series of cases and readings. The course opens with a two-day case series that will foreshadow each of the topics covered in the course. Similarly, the course ends with a two-day capstone case-series that will allow students to apply the lessons learned.\n\nCourse Requirements\n\nClass Participation: 50% of grade\n\nCourse Project: 50% of grade\n\nOptional Case Write-ups: extra credit toward class participation\n\nNote: All written submissions for this course must be professionally prepared, well-researched and documented, with reasonable fonts and margins.\n\nCourse Project\n\nFor complete description, see\nProjects\nsection.\n\nClass Participation\n\nBecause this is a case-based class, each student is required to be an active participant in case discussions. Your participation grade will reflect my assessment of your total contribution to the learning environment. This includes not only the frequency of your contributions in class, but also their quality. Quality, includes, among other things: (1) sound, rigorous, and insightful diagnosis (e.g. sharpening of key issues, depth and relevance of analysis); (2) ability to draw on course materials and your own experience productively; (3) ability to advance or sharpen in-class discussion and debate, willingness to take risky or unpopular points of view, use of logic, precision, and evidence in making arguments; (4) professionalism of your conduct (attendance, punctuality, preparedness, and showing respect to all section members and their class contributions). Unexcused absences and lack of preparation will be counted heavily against your grade.\n\nCase Write-ups\n\nSome students may be more comfortable demonstrating their mastery of core course concepts in written rather than in oral form. To accommodate those students, there are two opportunities for students to submit written case analyses (no more than 5 pages long).\n\nCase Write-up 1:\n\nApple Computer (A) (Abridged): Corporate Strategy and Culture, HBS# 495-044\n\nDue before class, session 8.\n\nCase Write-up 2:\n\nWolfgang Keller at Konigsbrau-Hellas A. E. (A), HBS # 498-045\n\nDue before class, session 16.\n\nCase write-ups are entirely optional and will be counted as extra credit towards class participation grades. The write-ups will be evaluated according to how well you have demonstrated your mastery of the course material. This includes the application of appropriate conceptual materials; the effective use of evidence to develop your arguments; explicit assumptions and clear logical inferences; and a coherent and integrated analysis and assessment. In addition the written work must be clear and well-organized. Case write-ups should be typed, with reasonable fonts and margins.",

And really care for them. We are still pretty much like\nfamily. We try to keep as much of that as possible even as the\ncompany is bigger. That's one think I learned from HP\n[Hewlett-Packard]. Bill Hewlett still flipped hamburgers for us at\nthe company picnic.\"\n\nThe Engineering Model\nAttachment to challenging work\nSelect for current competence\nPeer control\n\"We were very committed. It was a skunk-works mentality and\nthe binding energy was very high.\"\n\"We wanted to assemble teams of people who are turned on by\ndifficult problems. The emphasis was to build an environment\nof individuals who are performance driven, achievement\noriented, customer focused, feel relatively at ease to join and\ndisband from specific teams, skilled at interdisciplinary problem\nsolving irrespective of culture or discipline.\"\n\nThe Bureaucracy Model\nAttachment to work\nSelect for current competence\nControl by formal procedures\n\"We're not hierarchical as much as we are procedures,\nmethodologies, and systems. I really try to see that everybody\nin the company maintains procedures rather than just hand\nwave and do things any way. We don't want to be so\nhierarchical as to be startling, nor do we want to be so flat as to\nhave everybody poking into everybody else's business.\"\n\"We make sure things are documented, have job descriptions\nfor people, project descriptions, and pretty rigorous project\nmanagement techniques.\"\n\nThe Autocracy Model\nAttachment to compensation\nSelect for current competence\nDirect monitoring\n\"One thing we wanted to avoid was consensus management. I\nthink it lends itself to major slow-downs in development\nschedules. We have good communication around a core group,\nbut we certainly know who makes the call on things... We don't\nhave the resources available to spend a lot of time getting\neveryone warm and fuzzy rather than to a decision.\"\n\"You work, you get paid.\"\n\nEmployment Models\nDimensions\nAttachment\nSelection\nControl\nEmployment\nModel\nWork\nPotential\nProfessional\nStar\nWork\nSkill\nCultural\nEngineering\nLove\nFit\nCultural\nCommitment\nWork\nSkill\nFormal\nBureaucracy\nMoney\nSkill\nDirect\nAutocracy\n\nEmployment Models\nModel\nFounder\nCEO\nStar\nCommitment\nEngineering\nBureaucracy\nAutocracy\nHybrids\n9%\n6%\n13%\n12%\n32%\n25%\n7%\n20%\n6%\n5%\n33%\n32%\n\nEmployment Models\nBlueprint\nAdvantages\nDisadvantages\nStar\nCommitment\nEngineering\nBureaucracy\nAutocracy\nHybrid\n\nEmployment Models\nModel\nFounder\nCEO\nStar\nCommitment\nEngineering\nBureaucracy\nAutocracy\nHybrids\n9%\n6%\n13%\n12%\n32%\n25%\n7%\n20%\n6%\n5%\n33%\n32%\n\nBusiness Strategies\nRadical Innovation\n49%\nTechnology Enhancement\n20%\nSales, Marketing or Service\n14%\nCost Minimization\n7%\nHybrid\n10%\nWhich strategy \"fits\" which model?\n\nSTAR\nCOMMITMENT\nENGINEERING\nAUTOCRACY\nBUREAUCRACY\nInnovation\nEnhancement\nSales,\nMarketing\nor Service\nCost\nAlignment with Strategy\n\nStrategy/Model Alignment\n?

Star firms have the largest post-IPO increases in market cap,\nfollowed closely by commitment firms.\n? Autocracy firms perform the worst, followed by engineering.\n\nEffects of Changing the Model\n? Changing the Founder's Model\n? Is most likely to occur when the CEO is replaced\n? Is more likely to occur with star and commitment models\n? Is most likely to change toward a bureaucracy\n? Is associated with a lower probability of IPO\n? Increases the likelihood of failure\n? Has less growth in market cap after going public\n? Tends to have more disruptive effects when the move is away\nfrom one of the basic blueprints.\n? Is higher when models shift toward a bureaucracy or hybrid and\nlower in a shift to an engineering model.\n\nImplications?\n? Compelling evidence of the benefits of having a\nconsistent employment model.\n? Entrepreneurs (and change agents) should be sensitive\nto the impact of different models:\n? The effects of history (the founder's model)\n? Issues of \"lock-in\" and scalability\n? The need for measured growth\n? The importance of clarity about what the model is\n?
