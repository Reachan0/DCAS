      "content": "Solution for Homework #1: Manufacturing Overview\n2.008 Design and Manufacturing II\nSpring 2004\nOut: February 4th\nDue: February 11th\nProblem 1:\nDo review question 5 of the handout, Chapter 1 of Benhabib's book.\n\"Compare Ford's passenger car manufacturing and marketing strategies in the early 20th\ncentury to those implemented by GM. Elaborate on the continuing use of these\ncompetitive practices in today's manufacturing industries.\"\nSolution:\nIn the early 20th century, car manufacturing at Ford as well as at GM was a\ncapital-intensive activity, driven by the forces of mass production. A specialized\nworkforce in which the individuals performed small tasks over and over again reduced\nproduction costs dramatically. This manufacturing and assembly process was made\npossible by product standardization.\nThe Ford Motor Company pushed this manufacturing technique to its extreme by\napplying Taylor s \"scientific management\" concept to its assembly lines. This included a\nlack of customer choices by selling only one or very few products in high volumes. The\nmarketing strategy behind this concept was to sell cars by their low price\n(competitiveness-via-price strategy).\nGM used standardization techniques as well as Ford to cut down manufacturing\ncosts. But with standardized components (platforms), different models were built,\ncovering multiple pricing categories. Using the same parts for different models helped to\nmaintain low prices and to sell high volumes while different models addressed a wide\nfield of customers by offering some choice. In addition minor changes were introduced in\nfrequent intervals, which kept the products up to date.\nCurrent manufacturing is still driven by low-cost mass production as well as by a\nneed for flexibility. As industrial design (color, style) a mainstream issue, the technology\ngap between different manufacturers becomes small, and companies keep decreasing the\nproduct lifecycle to attract more customers. In order to maintain a balance between the\ncost and flexibility, new techniques have been developed, such as MRP, JIT as well as\nthe flexible manufacturing systems. Extensive use of IT-systems and computer-based\ntools throughout the complete manufacturing process is a necessity in order to stay\ncompetitive.\n\nProblem 2:\nDo discussion question 9 of the same handout.\n\"Fast food outlets have been managed via familiar manufacturing strategies that have\nbeen evolved over the past century, moving from a mass-production environment to mass\ncustomization. Discuss and compare the manufacturing strategies of McDonalds and\nSubway (or Chinese food truck at Mass Ave. and LaVerde). Sketch the process flow of\neach case.\nName engineering products which are produced by a similar manufacturing strategy for\neach case.\"\nSolution:\nMcDonalds/food truck offer standardized products with an apparent pull\nproduction system (when an order comes in or when the storage level of specific product\nfalls below some number, the production (assembly) starts). Products with a high demand\nmight even be pre-made and ready to go. High throughput and low cost are the main\ntarget. Every product is \"assembled\" in a standardized sequence, using always the same\nset of ingredients. Some ingredients are a part of more than one product, though (the\ncircles in the process flow overlap each other).\nMost of the mass production systems and batch production systems have similar natures\nas seen in McDonalds/food truck. They include automobiles and computers (DELL: order\none, produce one with a near complete product.).\ntriggers\nOrder\nproduction\nOne possible process flow for McDonalds/Food Truck\n\nSubway/La Verde offer a variety of choices, which can be customized as the\nproduct is made upon demand. Target is high quality and high customer satisfaction. For\nthis higher value, the customer has to pay a higher price and/or their patience. This type\nof production is the same as many job shops, which produce fully custom ordered\nproducts, such as airplanes, lithography machines, and custom-designed houses.\nOne possible process flow for Subway/La Verde"

      "content": "Solution Homework #2: Injection Molding\n2.008 Design and Manufacturing II\nSpring 2004\nOut: February 18th\nDue: February 25th\nProblem 1:\nWhat are the design considerations in replacing a metal container for carbonated\nbeverages with plastic bottles? Think about the functional requirements and explain how\nthe design of a plastic container differs from that of a metal can.\nSolution\nWhile the functional requirements, naturally, are almost the same for metal and plastic\ncontainers (remember: functional requirements are \"what you want\" and solution-\nneutral), the design parameters to fulfill the functional requirements may differ.\nIn particular the following differences can be stated:\no Since plastic is a cheap material and less dense than metal, the urge for a material-\nsaving design is not as strong as when using aluminum.\no Special attention has to be paid to the permeability of plastic. In order to conserve\nthe gas for a long period of time (less than 15% loss in 120 days, from the\nlecture), a special processing with low permeability plastic is necessary.\no Plastic is not as strong as metal. The wall thickness can be increased, small\ncorrugation or, better, a wavy structure (like small coke bottles) can be used. The\nbottom is usually thick to provide rigidity and a save stand.\no Because plastic is easier to form into complicated shapes than cans, it became\nmore feasible to make them more aesthetically and ergonomically pleasing;\nhence, soda in bottles again, but now with grippy sides. Also scaling up the size is\nfeasible.\no In principle, plastic didn't eat that much of Al cans, but replaced most of the glass\nbottles.\n\nProblem 2:\nConsider the injection molded L-bracket made of Polycarbonate shown in Figure 1. You\nare asked to find the mold design with the parting line that leads to the minimum possible\nclamping force to mold the part.\n10mm\n∅\nx\nz\ny\nPlane B\nGate\nC\n6 mm\n6 mm\n1 mm\n1 mm\n3 mm\nPlane A\nFigure 1: L-bracket part drawings\na) What would be the minimum clamping force required for this part? Indicate the\nlocation of gate and the location of parting line/plane for the minimum clamping\nforce design. Assume that the peak injection pressure is 6,000 psi. Also discuss\nthe potential problems in producing the part with this design.\nb) You soon realize that the minimum clamping force is not as important as the\nquality of the part and productivity of the process (as long as the machine has\nenough clamping force). i) What would be a better position of the parting\nline/plane and gate and direction of injection molding? Why? ii) What is the\nclamping force required for the new design?\nSolution a)\nThe minimum cross-sectional area projected on the parting plane A will require the\nminimum clamping force.\nAmin=62-52=11mm2\nFmin=PxAmin=6000 x 11/(25.4)2=102.3 lbs=0.05 ton\n\nHowever, this parting line is not a good choice due to the following potential\nproblems.\nPotential Problems\na) The hole on the vertical wall from the parting plane needs a sliding core, which\nmakes it costly in mold machining and injection molding operations.\nb) High aspect ratio deep groove machining on the cavity plate is needed, which may\nrequire the use of very expensive machines, like: EDM (Electro Discharge\nMachining) machine. If you move the parting line along the z-axis, you need to\nmachine both the cavity plate and core plate, which is also costly.\nc) High aspect ratio and little/no draft angle in vertical (or injection) direction will\nmake it very difficult to eject the molded part.\nSolution b)\nNormally, the clamping capacity of injection molding machines is over 10 tons and\nthe magnitude of it is not an important parameter with few exceptions. Mold design\nfor better quality of parts and lower cost process is much more important than the\nminimum clamping force. When you choose a parting line or plane, the direction of\ninjection is of more importance, in general.\ni) Parting plane B and C are much better choices than plane A, with a gate location\nmarked in Figure 1 above. Because,\nii) The injection direction normal to the parting plane B/C does not require any\nsliding core to form the whole feature at the bottom. Also, slight draft angle can\nbe given to the side of cavity, with a conventional milling machine. With the gate\nposition marked in the figure, a weld line will be formed across the hole from the\ngate. Since the weld line is formed while the melt temperature is still hot, quite\nstrong weld line will be formed and remain as strong as the bulk.\niii) Projected area on the plane B=6x10 - 3.14(1.5)2= 52.9 mm2 (it s the same for C),\nClamping force is F=6000 x 52.9/(25.4)2= 492 lbs = 0.5 ton\nProblem 3:\nThe following pictures show one half of an injection molded housing. With the basic\ndesign rules for injection molding in mind, is this a good design? Explain why/why not\nand suggest any improvements you might want to make. If you would like to, you can\nmake a sketch to explain your thoughts.\n\nSolution\nInjection Molding Design Guidelines\nMuch has been written regarding design guidelines for injection molding. Yet, the design\nguidelines can be summed up in just a few design rules.\n- Use uniform wall thicknesses throughout the part. This will minimize sinking,\nwarping, residual stresses, and improve mold fill and cycle times.\n- Use generous radius at all corners. The inside corner radius should be a minimum of\none material thickness.\n- Use the least thickness compliant with the process, material, or product design\nrequirements. Using the least wall thickness for the process ensures rapid cooling,\nshort cycle times, and minimum shot weight. All these result in the least possible\npart cost.\n\n- Design parts to facilitate easy withdrawal from the mold by providing draft (taper)\nin the direction of mold opening or closing.\n- Use ribs or gussets to improve part stiffness in bending. This avoids the use of thick\nsection to achieve the same, thereby saving on part weight, material costs, and cycle\ntime costs.\nFor the case of figure 2/3, the points to note are the radii (missing!) and thickness (not\nuniform!). Also, on closer inspection a draft angle is missing.\na) Radii\no Sharp corners greatly increase the stress concentration. This high amount\nof stress concentration can often lead to failure of plastic parts.\no Sharp corners can come about in non-obvious places. Examples of this are\na boss attached to a surface, or a strengthening rib. These corners need to\nbe radiused just like all other corners. The stress concentration factor\nvaries with radius, for a given thickness.\no In addition to reducing stresses, fillet radiuses provide streamlined flow\npaths for the molten plastic resulting in easier fills.\nb) Thickness\no Parts should have a uniform wall thickness. Thick sections cool slower\nthan thin sections. The thin section first solidifies, and the thick section is\nstill not fully solidified. As the thick section cools, it shrinks and the\nmaterial for the shrinkage comes only from the unsolidified areas, which\nare connected, to the already solidified thin section.\no Parts should be designed with a minimum wall thickness consistent with\npart function and mold filling considerations. The thinner the wall the\nfaster the part cools, and the cycle times are short, resulting in the lowest\npossible part costs.\no Also, thinner parts weight less, which results in smaller amounts of the\nplastic used per part which also results in lower part costs.\no This builds stresses near the boundary of the thin section to thick section.\nSince the thin section does not yield because it is solid, the thick section\n(which is still liquid) must yield. Often this leads to warping or twisting. If\nthis is severe enough, the part could even crack.\nc) Draft angle\no Drafts (or taper) in a mold, facilitates part removal from the mold. The\namount of draft angle depends on the depth of the part in the mold, and its\nrequired end use function.\no The draft is in the offset angle in a direction parallel to the mold opening\nand closing.\n\nProblem 4:\nYou are going to make tools for your Yo-Yo in two weeks. You should define your\nfunctional requirements first before you seek design parameters, which meet the\nrequirements. Please define the functional requirements of your own Yo-Yo and try to\nfind design parameters that fulfill those requirements. Show the mapping process in-\nbetween \"What\" and \"How\" at the top two levels. This is not a single solution problem.\nIn the world of design, you, as a designer, have all the power to explore any possible\ndesign (at least until it is proven to be a poor one). Feel free to sketch your design on a\npiece of paper.\nSolution\nThis is a progressive type problem you will find your own solution during the course of\n2.008 laboratory sessions. Discuss you design with your lab group members before the\nlab session IV and try to synthesize a better design solution for your group's Yo-Yo.\nThe following paragraph gives an overview of how your functional requirements,\nmanufacturing restrictions and design parameters might look like.\nFunctional requirements (FR)\no FR1: playability (the yo-yo has to work in the end)\no FR2: additional requirements set up by your group (e.g. exchangeable parts, looks\ncool, good lab grade with nice presentation, etc.)\no FR3: pass drop test could be another FR for your Yo-Yo\no Remember that the functional requirements are the WHAT you want the yo-yo to\naccomplish. \"Has a radio tracking device embedded in it\" is a design parameter;\n\" Is easy to find\" would be the functional requirement.\nDesign parameters (DP)\no Top level\nTo meet FR1, you need to have a DP1: the device should look like a Yo-Yo (a\nrounded mass around the rim to transform potential energy to rotational energy,\nand vice versa). If you have additional FR, for example \"FR2: Easy to find\", you\nneed to find a solution to meet the FR2 such as, DP2: Embedded radio tracking\ndevice. DP3 for FR3 could be a rigid design with no thin parts sticking out.\nSince you are supposed to make your product with the processes available at the shop, we\nneed to think about the mapping process between DP domain and Process Domain.\no 2nd level\nTo meet DP1 in the process domain, PV1 should be moldability of your DP1.\nPV2 may be the possibility to integrate the radio device into your Yo-Yo. Since\nwe don't have a detailed design yet, we cannot go further down at this process\ndomain and need to go back to the FR domain one level down (zig-zagging).\n\nFor a given DP1 and PV1, FR1 needs to be further broken down to fulfill what\nyou want. You may need to have a bigger rotational moment of inertia (more\nweight into the rim of the yo-yo (FR11), which will conserve more energy while\nrotating), to have a bigger radius of rotation for the string windings (FR12), a nice\nfit to average size hands either for lefty and righty (FR13), safety for young kids\n(FR14), etc. (These may differ for each designer.) FR31 might be that the Yo-Yo\ndoesn t fall apart when dropped by a certain distance, FR 32 that it doesn t break\nwhen dropped.\nDP11 may be the cross sectional shape of the Yo-Yo. DP12: Gap for string (about\n1.5 of the string diameter.), DP13: Outer dimension of Yo-Yo. (look, this will be\nconstrained by the machine and mold size, when you map this one to the process\ndomain.) DP14: Kind of plastic material or non-sharp edges. When you map\nbetween DP's to PV's, the design for injection molding needs to be considered,\nsuch as; thinnest possible uniform thickness, etc. DP31 can be the overlapping of\nthe different parts, DP32 the wall thickness or the inclusion of ribs.\nIf you have FR2 in your design, you then need to map between FR2 and DP2 by\ndefining children of FR2 for a chosen DP2."

      "content": "Solution Homework #3: Metal Cutting\n2.008 Design and Manufacturing II\nSpring 2004\nProblem 1:\n(a) Consider the Merchant's Cutting Force diagram in Figure 1 and the chip-workpiece\ninterface during orthogonal cutting in Fig. 2.\nα\nφ\nR\nFt\nFc\nFn\nFs\nF\nN\nα\nβ\nβ-α\nFig 1. Merchant's diagram\nFig 2. Cutting FBD\nMerchant's hypothesis is that the shear plane is located to minimize the cutting force, or\nwhere the shear stress is maximum. Derive the Merchant's relationship between shear\nangle, rake angle, and friction angle as below from the diagram above.\no\nα\nβ\nφ = 45\n+\n-\n(b) Consider the directions of the cutting force and the thrust force. Fc, cutting force, is\nalways positive, since the material is removed. Is the thrust force, Ft, also positive at all\ntimes? If not, explain why. Also explain how you can make Ft = 0 for a given friction\ncoefficient between the tool and the work piece.\nSolution\n(a)\nFrom the Force diagram (we discussed it in class so you know how each of the elements\ncame in), we know that\nFs = Fc*cosφ - Ft*sinφ\n(1)\nFn = Fc*sinφ + Ft*cosφ\n(2)\nWhere\nFc = net horizontal cutting force\nFt = net vertical thrust force\n\nFs = shear force along shear plane\nFn = shear force normal to shear plane\nThere are two ways to derive Merchant s Relationship: find the minimum of the cutting\nforce or the maximum of the shear stress. We will have a look at both.\ni) Find the minimum of the cutting force Fc\nA\nt0 iw\n(3)\nF = σ iA = σ\n= σ\ns\ns\ns\ns\ns\nsin φ\nsin φ\nFt = tan( β -α)\n(4)\nFc\nWith σs as the shear stress and As the shear area; t0 is the thickness of the uncut chip,\ncalled the depth of cut, w is the width of the work.\n(3) and (4) in (2):\nt w\ni\nσ\n= F cos φ - F sin φtan(β -α)\ns\nc\nc\nsin φ\nt w\ni\niσ\n⇔F = 0\ns i\n\n(5)\nc\nsin φ\ncos φ -\n\nsin φtan(β -α\n\n)\nIn order for the cutting force to be minimum at angle φ , the first derivative has to be\nzero:\n∂F c = 0\n∂φ\nSubstituting equation (5) and solving:\n!\n∂F\ni\niσs ⎢\n⎡- cos φ\n-sin φ - cos φtan(β -α) ⎤\nc = t w\ni\n-\n=0\n∂φ\n⎣ sin2 φ cos φ - sin φtan(β -α)\nsin φ i (cos φ - sin φtan( β -α ))2 ⎥⎦\n⇔cos φi[cos φ -sin φtan( β -α)] = sin φi[sin φ + cos φtan( β -α)]\n⇔cos φ - sin2 φ = 2 cos φsin φtan(β -α)\nWith the trigonometric expressions\ncos φ -sin2 φ = cos 2 φ\n2cos φsin φ =\n\nsin 2 φ\n\nwe get\ncos 2 φ = sin 2 φtan(β -α)\n⇔tan 2 φ = cot( β -α)\nAnd another trigonometric expression: tan 2 φ = cot(π/ 2 -\n\nφ\n\n)\nWhich leads us to\nπ\n- φ = β -α\n⇒\no\nα\nβ\nφ = 45\n+\n-\nii) Find the maximum of the shear stress\nThe shear stress is given by\nσs =\n\nFs/Area\n\n(6)\nIf the width of the work is given by w, and the uncut chip thickness is to, the area along\nwhich Fs acts is\nArea = to*w/sinφ\n(7)\nEquation (6) then becomes with (1) and (7)\nσs = (Fc*cosφ - Ft*sinφ) / (to*w/sinφ)\n(8)\nFrom the force diagram we also know that\nFt/Fc = tan(β-α)\n(9)\nSubstituting (9) in (8), we have\nσs = [Fc*sinφ(cosφ - tan(β-α)*sinφ)] / (to*w)\n(10)\nNow, in order for the shear stress to be maximum at angle φ\n∂σs /∂φ = 0\nSubstituting equation (10) and solving\n\n∂σs /∂φ = 1/to*w[Fc(cos2φ - sin2φ) - Fc(tan(β-α)*2*sinφ*cosφ)]\ncos φ -sin2 φ =\n\ncos 2 φ\nFrom trigonometry we know\n2cos φsin φ = sin 2 φ\nSubstituting and equating to zero, we have\nFc*cos2φ = Fc*sin2φ*tan(β-α)\n→\ntan2φ = cot(β-α)\n(11)\nAgain, from trigonometry: tan 2 φ = cot( π/ 2 - φ )\nThe principal solution is\nπ/2 - 2φ = β-α\n→\n2φ = π/2 + α - β\n→\nφ = π/4 + α/2 - β/2\n(b)\nWe know that\nFt = R sin(β - α) and Ft = Fc tan(β - α)\nThe magnitude of Fc is always positive (since the direction of the feed is always towards\nthe material); the sign of Ft can be either positive or negative, depending on the relative\nmagnitudes of β and α. When β > α, the sign of Ft is positive (downward) and when β <\nα, it is negative (upward). Therefore, in order to make the thrust force = 0, we make β =\nα. This can be achieved in two ways:\n1) Change the rake angle of the tool, α.\n2) By adding lubricant, effectively changing the friction angle β.\nIt is the second step that we most commonly employ in machining when something is\n\"wrong\" in the cut.\n\nProblem 2:\nYour lab group decided to make fancy transparent-look Yo-Yos and designed the body of\nthe Yo-Yo to be injection molded as follows. For a solid look, two identical parts are\nsupposed to be assembled with an insert-molded bolt and nut.\n2.5\"\n0.25\"\n0.8\"\nFigure 1. Injection molded YoYo body\na) After learning about polymer materials and processes, you now know this design\nis not good for injection molding. Make necessary design changes on the figure\nbelow and explain why you chose to make them.\nb) The material provided by Dave and Pat is Polypropylene, which is translucent.\nExplain in one sentence why Polypropylene (PP) is not transparent. After\nsearching for crystal clear and high impact resistant materials, you find out that\npolycarbonate (PC) is the right one for your nude Yo-Yo. Why is PC transparent?\n(1 sentence) Are those materials thermosetts or thermoplastic? How you can\nprove that?\nc) From the manufcaturer of the Polycarbonate resin, you received the modulus-\ntemperature curves shown below. Which is the right M-T curve of Polycarbonate?\n(A or B?) What is the approximate Tg of PC?\nd) What would be the clamping force required for this part? Choose a proper parting\nline and assume the injection pressure is 1000 psi with a packing process which\nrequires a packing pressure about twice the injection pressure.\nf) The cycle time of the part (after making necessary design changes in (a)) is still\nmeasured as 2 minute. It is composed of mold filling (10%), part cooling (75%),\nejecting and mold closing, etc. This cycle time cannot justify the selling price at\nthe market. Therefore you redesigned it with 40% reduction of the thickness of\nthe part. Assume that the thickness is changed uniformly over the whole part.\nPlease estimate the new cycle time.\n\n2.008 spring 2002\nModulus-temperature of PC\nΕ, N/m2\nA\nB\nT, 0C\nSolution\na)\nparting line\nReasons for the design changes:\n- Use uniform wall thicknesses throughout the part. This will minimize sinking,\nwarping, residual stresses, and improve mold fill and cycle times.\n- Use generous radius at all corners. The inside corner radius should be a minimum of\none base wall thickness??\n- Use the least thickness compliant with the process, material, or product design\nrequirements. Using the least wall thickness for the process ensures rapid cooling,\nshort cycle times, and minimum shot weight. All these result in the least possible\npart cost.\n\nb)\nPP is translucent because it is a crystalline material. PC is transparent because it is\namorphous.\nPP and PC are both thermoplastics. A method to find out if this is true would be to reheat\nthe finished product to processing temperature. If it melts it is a thermoplastic.\nc)\nCurve B is clearly a temperature-modulus curve for an amorphous material and therefore\napplies to PC. Tg is approximately 90 - 100° C.\nd)\nA packing pressure of twice the injection pressure means that after the first injection with\n1000 Psi an additional stroke with 2000 Psi is applied in order to pack more material to\ncompensate the shrinkage. The required clamping force is area*pressure. With the parting\nline as indicated in the figure in a) the clamping force becomes:\n2000 Psi * 3.14*1.252 = 9812.5 lbs =about 5 tons\ne)\nA reduction of the wall thickness and therefore of the volume of material injected will\nreduce the injection time as well as the cooling time. The new cycle time can be\ncalculated according to the following equation:\n(1) The filling time will be decreased by 40%: the new filling time = 0.6x (0.1x120\nsec) = 7.2 sec\n(2) The cooling time is be proportional to the square of the thickness decrease: new\ncooling time = (0.6)2 x (0.75 x 120) = 32.4 sec\n(3) Ejecting, mold closing time will be the same = 0.15 x 120 = 18sec\nThe new cycle time: 57.6 sec (52% reduction !!!)"

(5\npoints)\nThe shear plane adjusts its location to minimize the cutting force or maximize the shear\nstress.\n\nThe tool given is HSS material with a rake angle of 10 o. The friction coefficient between\nthe tool and the material given is 0.5. What is the shear angle, φ? (5 points)\nThe angle, β can be found from the relationship,\n\nμ = tan(β)\n\nThat means that\n\nβ = arctan(0.5) = 26.6°\n\nFrom the problem statement,\n\nrake angle = 10° = α\n\nTherefore, from Merchant's relationship,\n\nφ = 45° + 10°/2 - 26.6°/2 = 36.7°\n\nd) Now you set the turning parameters as below. Rotational speed, N=400 rpm, Tool travel\nspeed along the work piece length, 12 inch/min, and the machining is going to be done by\none pass. (15 points + 5 bonus points)\n\nIf the specific energy of the steel given is 1.47 hp. min/in3, what is the cutting force?

Assume the\npower index n = 0.2 in the tool life equation. (7 points)\n\nLook at the relationship when T = 1 min. This makes V = C. If you trace along the 1\nmin. line in Figure 1-4, you'll see that V = 500 = C at the red mark. Now you can predict\nthe life of the tool with n = 0.2 and V = 1860 in./min. as you found above.\n\nFirst converting V to have units of ft./min.\n\n1860/12 = 155 ft./min.\n\nNow solving for T,\n\nT0.2 = 500/155\n\nT = 350 min.\n\nIf you use the same HSS tool for machining of softer materials, like aluminum, is the tool\nlife curve moving to the left of curve b (such as a) or to the right (such as curve e)?(3\npoints)\n\nMachining a softer material would push the life curve to the right, towards point e.\n\nProblem 2: (30 points)\nFrom the injection molding lecture, you learned that the design for injection molding includes\nthe following points.\n-\nUse uniform wall thicknesses throughout the part. This will minimize sink\nmarks, warpage, and improve general performance of the molded part.\n-\nUse generous radius at all corners and enough draft angles for the sides.\n-\nUse the least wall thickness to ensure rapid cooling, short cycle times, and\nminimum shot weight.\nYou have designed and machined successfully the outer shell of your Yo-Yo as below.\n\nFig. 2-1 Yo-Yo outer shell design for injection molding\n\nNow you are running the injection molding machine at the shop with the mold for the above part.\nMaterial supplied is PP (polypropylene), and the molding machine parameters were set already\nby someone whom you don't think reliable.\n\na) You first ran the machine for 50 shots. All the shots produced had a lot of flashes.\n\nWhat would be the first guess on the cause of this trouble and the possible remedy of it? (5\npoints)\n\nThe injection pressure may be too high. To prevent flashes, the pressure may be reduced.\n\nPmax\nPmin\nTmin\nTmax\nD\nB\nA\nC\nBetter weld\nLow cost\nGood\nmolding\ncondition\n\nFig. 2-2 Injection molding process window\n\nb) You changed the settings randomly, but didn't know exactly which knob is for which\nparameter. Therefore, you have observed different kind of defects for different\ncombinations of the melt temperature and the injection pressure.\n\nWhat kind of defect do you see for each region (A, B, C, D) of the process window? (5 points)\n(The question in (a) will be repeated, but answer them shortly.)\n\nA: poor quality\n\nB: flash\n\nC: burn, degradation\n\nD: short shot\n\nc) After settling down the process conditioning, the cycle time of the part is measured as 1\nminute. It is composed of mold filling (10%), part cooling (70%), ejecting and mold\nclosing, and etc. (20%). This cycle time cannot justify the selling price at the market. So,\nyou need to reduce the thickness of the part further (30%) and to increase the injection\nspeed 100%.\n\nExplain why you need to increase the speed of injection? (3 points)\n\nWith thinner walls the flow path ratio (L/t) may become too high and result a short shot. In\norder to prevent a short shot, the injection speed needs to be increased to fill the cavity before\nthe melt freezes.\n\nEstimate the new cycle time. (7 points) Assume the thickness change uniformly over the\nwhole part.\n\nThe filling time will be reduced to one half due to the increased filling speed:\n\n60 sec - 0.1 - 0.7- 0.5 = 2.1 sec\n\nThe cooling time depends on the thickness squared:\n\n60 sec - 0.7 - 0.72 = 20.6 sec\n\nThe time for ejecting, mold closing, etc. will remain the same:\n\n60 sec - 0.2 = 12 sec\n\nNew cycle time: t = 3 + 20.6 + 12 sec = 34.7 sec, which is quite close to the economic\nproduction rate.\n\nd) During one process cycle of injection molding, draw the cavity pressure history on the\nfigure below, during one cycle of injection molding . (5 points)\n\nExplain the sudden increase of the pressure after the mold cavity is completely filled and\nwhy it is needed. (5 points)\n\nThe pressure peak after the mold is filled is due to the packing pressure which is applied\nin order to compensate the differential shrinkage between the metal mold and the plastic\npart.\n\nCavity pressure during a cycle of molding\n\nProblem 3: (20 points)\n\nThe first high volume production of a pressure sensor began in 1974 at National Semiconductor,\nand the volume of the market has grown to 45 million units in 1998. Nearly all pressure sensors\nare produced using bulk micromachining technology. The technology is available through the\nKOH bulk micromachining of the silicon wafer, and the MAP sensor and disposable blood\npressure sensor are the two largest applications. Fig 3. shows the bulk micromachined silicon\nbonded on top of pyrex with a back side hole. The membrane deflection is measured by four\npiezoresistors forming a Wheatstone bridge to get the pressure from the back side hole.\n\nFigure 3\n\na) In order to make the membrane, the bottom of the wafer is coated with silicon nitride\nfirstly and then etched to form a square opening. As KOH etching proceeds, the exposed\n{100} planes of p-type silicon etch rapidly while the {111} planes etch slowly, which\nmakes angle θ with the plane of the wafer.\n\nWhat is the angle θ? (3 points)\n\nθ = 54.7°\n\nb) The KOH solution etches the (100) silicon at 1.4 μm/min and stops when it reaches the\ntop layer of n-type silicon. The remaining n-type silicon forms the membrane. The\nthickness of the wafer is 650 micron and the top 50 μm layer of the wafer is n-type\nsilicon.\nIf the membrane size is 300 μm by 300 μm, what should be the size of the silicon nitride\nopening and how long does it take to KOH etch a membrane? (7 points)\n\nFrom the figure we get:\n\nw = 600/tan(54.7°)\nL = 300 + 2 - w = 300 + 2 - 600/tan(54.7°) = 1149.6 μm\n\nWhere L is the length of one side of the silicon nitride opening according to the following\nfigure:\n\nThe etching time can be calculated according to the following equation:\n\nt = 600/1.4 = 428.6 min\n\nIf you can develop a surface micromachined pressure sensor of the same membrane size\nand sensing circuitry, what would be the most outstanding benefit you can get in\ncomparison to the bulk micromachined sensors? (5 points)\n\nYou saw from above that the size of the back side opening is much bigger than the size of\nthe top membrane (15 times larger). A surface micromachined device will be much more\ncompact, and therefore more products can be produced per one wafer.\n\nc) In order to bulk micromachine silicon wafer as described above, you need to select a p-\ntype (100) silicon from the stock of many different wafers.\n\nWhich wafer is the right one among the four types below? (5 points)\n\nAnswer: __d__________________ (among a, b, c, d)\n\nPrimary\nflat\na\nc\nb\nd\n\nProblem 4.\n\nDesign for manufacturing or design for assembly is one of the core themes, which 2.008 is trying\nto deliver to you. (10 points)\n\nDescribe one clear example of DFM or DFA you have seen around you. An illustration of the\nexample and adequate explanation will make the answer. (10 points.) Do not over describe your\nanswer. Less than a half page is the maximum length.\n\nLiterally, most of the industrial products around us are well designed for manufacturing. Why?\nOtherwise, they cannot survive and stay at the market. I wish you well consider this aspect of\ndesign in your Yo-Yo project."

In the end (lab III) you will produce a machined paperweight with your own unique inscription. You will\nbecome familiar with a CNC lathe and a CNC mill, as well as Mastercam, a computer-aided manufacturing software\npackage. You will also learn G-code, the alphanumeric programming language used to control CNC machine tools.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nProcess planning is an engineering activity that determines the appropriate procedures for transforming raw\nmaterials into a final product as specified by an engineering design. Engineering designs are conventionally\ndocumented using detailed diagrams indicating important design characteristics such as dimensions, tolerances,\nmaterials, and other pertinent specifications. Even though these diagrams convey a large amount of information\nabout a design, they are incomplete in that they do not describe the manufacturing steps necessary to produce the\nfinal part. Effective process plans provide this information. In practice, design, process planning, and\nmanufacturing are interrelated since the capabilities and characteristics of available equipment, manufacturing\nprocesses, and personnel can have a significant impact on the final design of a product.\nG-code\n\nWhen the designed product is produced using CNC machine tools, the machine tool controller needs explicit\ninstructions describing the type and order of individual steps required to perform a given task. These instructions\nare provided to the controller in the form of alphanumeric codes (G-code) and are usually called a part program. A\ncomplete listing of G-code commands and a set of example code/part pairs can be found in the appendices.\n\nG-code itself can be written with any number of text editors, including the Windows notepad and, of course, emacs.\nAfter the code is verified with a simulation, it is loaded into one of the CNC machines.\nMastercam\n\nMastercam is a commercial Computer Aided Manufacturing software package. CAM is the process that links CAD\n(computer-aided design) with machine tools by automatically producing CNC code from a drawing. Mastercam\nincludes a CAD environment, a geometry-to-G-code translator, and a G-code simulator. It is possible to import\ngeometry from other drawing tools like AutoCAD, SolidWorks, or Pro/ENGINEER.\n\n2.008 - Design & Manufacturing II\n2 of 8\nThe CAD/CAM Labs\n\nLAB EXERCISES\n\nIn the next two labs, you will obtain an aluminum disc 3\" in diameter and .5\" thick (Fig. 1). Inscribe your own\nunique pattern on the top with the CNC milling machine (Fig. 2), and turn a custom border/facial profile on the\nremainder of the disk with the CNC lathe (Fig. 3).\n\nAll exercises will be conducted with a partner - each pair must turn in only one part and will receive a common\ngrade.1 You and your lab mate may need to meet outside of class in order to complete some of these assignments.\nIf you are feeling adventurous, you and your lab mate may produce two different paperweights. They will be\ngraded separately.\n\nFig. 1\n\nFig. 2\n\nFig. 3\n\nDuring Lab I, you and your lab mate will:\n-\nlearn how to write G-code so that you can manually create your own part programs\n-\nrun a series of tutorials designed to teach you how to use Mastercam Lathe\n-\nsee Mastercam create the G-code for a similar profile as shown in Fig. 3\n-\nuse Mastercam to draw the lathe profile of your paperweight (the top drawing can be done by hand or any\nsoftware)\n-\nuse Mastercam to run a toolpath on the profile\n-\nprepare for next week's lab\n\nDuring Lab II you and your lab mate will:\n-\nlearn how to use Mastercam Mill\n-\ncheck your pre-prepared handwritten G-code program for the mill portion of your paperweight\n-\nprepare for next week's lab\n\nDuring Lab III you and your lab mate will:\n-\nfinalize the drawings (combining top and side views)\n-\nfinalize your pre-prepared handwritten G-code program for the mill portion of your paperweight\n-\nrun your program on the CNC mill to inscribe your unique symbol into the center of your disc\n-\nuse the CNC lathe to run the profile program to turn/face the shape on your paperweight\n\n1 If you feel that your lab mate is not performing his/her fair share of the work please contact the TA to discuss\ngrading arrangements.\n2.008 - Design & Manufacturing II\n3 of 8\nThe CAD/CAM Labs\n\nDELIVERABLES\n\nThis page explains what you must have completed by a week after each lab session. See the \"Grading Procedures\"\nsection of the webpage for more details.\n\nDELIVERABLE - Lab I\n\n1) A 2-D drawing of the inscription to be machined on the top of your paperweight. This should be either hand-\ndrawn on graph paper or computer-drawn and dimensioned.\n2) A handwritten G-code program of your unique inscription. A Mastercam Mill generated program is cheating!\n3) A separate detailed cross-sectional sketch of the side view showing the profile shape that will be machined on\nthe lathe. This should also be properly dimensioned and neat.\n\nThings to think about:\n\n-\nYou should have the handwritten program on a 3.5\" floppy, or a Zip disk, (100MB, or 250MB) if you work on\nit at home so that you will be ready to debug and run at the beginning of Lab III.\n-\nThe program should be typed in using Windows Notepad. It must have a filename extension \".txt\".\n-\nKeep in mind that your inscription should fit within a 2.0\" diameter circle to allow for machining of the profile\non the perimeter.\n-\nYour milled inscription and profile shape must be unique.\n-\nWhen dimensioning, be sure to reference everything from the center and top of the disk.\n-\nDon't forget Z depths!\n-\nYour inscription must have at least one arc or circle - all straight lines are not allowed.\n-\nRemember the diameter of the end mill (it must fit between features) before you try anything too fine and\ndetailed.\n-\nRemember to consider how the disk will be held in the chuck on the lathe so that you don't machine into the\njaws of the chuck - leave at least .200\" of uncut material at the bottom.\n-\nRemember to consider the shape of the bit and the angle from which it will cut.\n-\nAn isometric view of your part is purely optional.\n\nDELIVERABLE - Lab II\n\n1) Finalized handwritten G-code for mill.\n2) Mastercam generated lathe toolpath for the profile view.\n\nDELIVERABLE - Lab III\n\n1) A completed paperweight, with both the milled inscription and turned profile.\n2) A hardcopy of the final handwritten program of the milled inscription if it was changed since Lab II.\n3) A Mastercam drawing of the final output of the entire paperweight, with both the top view and the side view on\nthe same drawing, completely dimensioned.\n\n2.008 - Design & Manufacturing II\n4 of 8\nThe CAD/CAM Labs\n\nAPPENDIX A: Producing the Sample Part\n\nStep I: Milled Inscription\n\nIn this example the Z0 has been established below the top of the raw stock by .010\". The first tool in the program is\na 1.5\" diameter end mill (T11) that will face off the top of the raw stock to establish a plane at Z0. It will remove all\nimperfections from the original rough surface to create a uniform flat surface parallel to the machine's X, and Y\nplanes. It is important to note that the parallelism of the surface to the machine's axes is critical for the engraving to\nbe uniform in depth and width of cut. The engraving tool (T14) is then used to engrave the letters \"KC\" at a depth\nof -.007\" into the face, followed by a 1/4\" ball end mill (T8) to machine a circular groove around the letters \"KC\".\n\nThe following is the program. The 2nd column is only to describe what each line, or \"block\" is doing and is not used\nby the control on the machine.\n\n2.008 - Design & Manufacturing II\n5 of 8\nThe CAD/CAM Labs\n\nN1M26T11S2000\nReturn the X, Y, and Z-axes to a predetermined clearance point for changing tools.\nInstall tool T11 (1.5\" end mill) for facing top surface, spindle speed 2000RPM\nN2G0G55G90X-2.0Y-1.3\nRapid positioning mode, designate work coordinate system 1, absolute positioning\nmode, move to the X, and Y values,\nN3Z.1\nRapid position Z to the clearance plane, .100\" above the part.\nN4G1Z0.F5.\nLinear feed to Z0 at 5\" per minute\nN5X2.0F10.\nLinear feed to X value at 10\" per minute\nN6X2.4Y0.\nCompound linear feed movement, still at 10\" per minute\nN7X-2.4\nFeed to next point\nN8X-2.0Y1.3\nFeed to next point\nN9X2.0\nFeed to next point\nN10G0Z.1\nRapid position Z up to clearance plane\nN11M26T14S4000\nReturn the X, Y, and Z-axes to a predetermined clearance point for changing tools.

These instructions can be commands to: turn\nthe spindle on, move on an axis, turn the coolant on, select a tool, or execute an entire pattern of movements. A\nletter followed by digits is called a 'word' and each program line is termed a 'block'. The commands are executed\nin order, one 'block' at a time.\n\nMachine tool programming began from a common starting point. The current common character set derives from\nthe first standard NC machining data communication standard - one-inch wide paper tape. In this standard, letters\nare used to define specific program elements:\n\nAddress\nMeaning\n\nAddress\nMeaning\nO\n\nprogram number\n\nF\n\nfeed rate\nN\n\nsequence number\n\nE\n\nthread lead\nG\n\npreparatory function\n\nS\n\nspindle speed\nX, Y, Z\ncoordinate axis motion\n\nT\n\ntool number\nR\n\narc/corner radius, or rapid plane\n\nM\n\nmisc./machine functions\nI\n\nabsolute center of arc in x-axis\n\nJ\n\nabsolute center of arc in y-axis\n\nDue to the power and frequent use of the preparatory functions, CNC control programs are often called G-code.\n\nLogically, different types of machines require different G-code programs. A lathe has different requirements than a\nmill or a grinder. In addition, as products have become more advanced and manufacturers have wished to\ndifferentiate their products from their competitors, custom commands have proliferated and made certain programs\nincompatible with different machines. It is therefore important to learn which codes are available on which\nmachines.\n\nCOMMONLY USED G-CODE FOR MILLING\n\nG00\nrapid linear motion\nG01\nlinear motion at preset feedrate F\nG02\ncircular feed motion - CW\nG03\ncircular feed motion - CCW\nG04\ndwell for time (P seconds)\n\nG40\ncutter compensation off\nG41\ncutter compensation left\nG42\ncutter compensation right\nG70\ninch units\nG75\nmulti-quadrant circles (EZ-Trak machine)\nG80\ncanned drill cycle cancel\nG81\nstandard canned drilling cycle (no pecking)\nG83\npeck drill cycle\nG90\nabsolute values\nG91\nincremental values\nG92\nestablish zero point\nG55\nWorkshift 1 (WS1) EZ-Trak machine, Paperweight, and Thermoform mold origin\n2.008 - Design & Manufacturing II\n7 of 8\nThe CAD/CAM Labs\n\nG56\nWorkshift 2 (WS2) EZ-Trak machine, Core mold origin\nG57\nWorkshift 3 (WS3) EZ-Trak machine, Cavity mold origin\n\nS\nspindle speed (RPM)\nF\nfeed rate (IPM)\nT\ntool number\nR\nHeight for rapid positioning in drilling cycles, or arc radius value when in G02, or G03\n\nM00\nprogram stop\nM01\nplanned optional stop, can be turned on or off at machine control\nM02\nend program (Cincinnati Milacron 7vc machine)\nM03\nspindle on (CW)\nM04\nspindle on (CCW)\nM05\nspindle off\nM06\nchange tool\nM08\ncoolant on\nM09\ncoolant off\nM13\ncoolant & spindle on (Cincinnati Milacron 7vc machine)\nM25\nreturn Z-axis to machine home (EZ-Trak machine)\nM26\nreturn X, Y, and Z axes to a predetermined clearance position for tool change (EZ-Trak)\nM30\nend program\nH\ntool height offset\n\nLeading zeros are commonly left out to help reduce the size of the programs.\n\nComputer notes:\n\nThe computers are networked to the ME server in bldg. 3.

The steps include:\n\n1) Designing a product to be manufactured,\n2) Designing the tooling to be used to form the parts for the product,\n3) Machining the tooling with computer numerically controlled (CNC) machine tools,\n4) Optimizing (tuning) the manufacturing processes,\n5) Manufacturing a batch of product, and\n6) Characterizing the manufactured products.\n\nThese exercises provide an opportunity to apply what you have learned about CAD/CAM, to learn about commonly used\nmanufacturing processes, and to recognize some issues concerning the optimization of a manufacturing process. One of the\nlessons that can be learned by going through this progression is that the process and the tooling impose limitations on the part\ndesign. As an example, whether the part is thermoformed or injection molded, it must be easily removable from the forming\ntool. Thus, we will see that for best results the product and the process (in this case the tooling) must be considered\nsimultaneously.\nINTRODUCTION\nForming processes are used to produce a tremendous variety and quantity of parts. Examples of forming processes for metal\ninclude casting and sheet metal forming. Two forming processes for polymeric materials, injection molding and\nthermoforming, will be the focus of this laboratory sequence. The lessons learned from examining injection molding and\nthermoforming will be applicable not only to plastic materials, but to metals and ceramics as well.\n\nAll forming processes have one essential ingredient in common. They all rely on a tool, die, or mold to create the geometry\nof the finished part. In general, each new part design demands the creation of a new tool or die. This situation contrasts\ngreatly with machining, where a set of cutting tools can be used to create a wide variety of finished shapes. Thus, we see that\nforming processes are less flexible to design changes than machining processes. However, forming processes result in net\nshape or near net shape parts. Thus, the use of forming processes is a balance between the cost and time associated with\ncreating the tool or die and lower cost per part when making a large number of parts.\nORGANIZATION\nSince the project will take several weeks to complete, we have broken the exercise into small segments: Labs IV, V, VI, VII,\nand VIII. During these labs students are organized into groups. Each group will design its product together and should\ndelegate responsibility to specific individuals/teams for the manufacture of each of the component parts you intend to\nproduce.\nLab IV: PRODUCT DESIGN\nEach yo-yo group will design a yo-yo that has two, or three injection molded parts, and one, or two thermoformed parts. The\ndesigns, which you submit, are required to specify the increment of interference that you intend, and the dimensional\ntolerance that you anticipate will provide adequate service.\nAn example of an exploded assembly drawing of a yo-yo can be found in the 'Lab Handouts' folder in the course locker.\nMold blank dimensions can be found in the 'Mill Injection Molding Blanks', and 'Lathe Injection Molding Blanks' folders.\nPrints of the 'Punch and Die Set' blanks, as well as a 'Thermoform Mold Blank' are in their respective folders.\n\n2.008 - Design & Manufacturing II -2- The Discrete Parts Manufacturing\n\nDesign requirements:\n\n-\nYo-Yos should be made of 2-3 injection-molded parts that snap fit together, and at least 1 thermoformed part\n\n-\nA set of ejector pins can be used if the injection-molded parts are not easily removable from the two-piece molds\n\n-\nEach injection-molded part cannot exceed 2.7 cubic inches in volume\n\n-\nThe maximum outside diameter of the injection-molded parts cannot exceed 2.5\" in diameter\n\n-\nHigh impact polystyrene 'HIPS' sheet of .020\", .030\", and .040\" thickness is provided for thermoformed parts\n\n-\nPolypropylene is provided for the injection-molded parts, various colors are available\n\n-\nAppropriate spec ranges (tolerances) must be specified for the dimensional features of each part\nLab V: TOOLING DESIGN\nTeam members will design the molds needed to produce the required parts and use Mastercam to generate \"G\" code to direct\nthe motion of the machine tools to produce these molds. Team members must confer with teammates to reach agreement on\ncommon dimensions and intended interferences to ensure snap-fits. All molds will be machined from aluminum. Ejector\npins can be used if the design warrants the need for them. Team members responsible for the thermoformed part will\nmachine their designed shape into a mold blank measuring 3.0\" in diameter X .625\" thick. They will also have an option to\ndesign, and machine a punch-and-die set for trimming the finished part from the material. The punch-and-die set will be\nmade from low carbon steel. Prints for all the blanks, including the punch-and-die blanks are posted in the course locker, as\nwell as a print showing the location and size of the ejector pin holes for the injection-molding blanks.\n\nBe sure, when importing your design to the mold blank templates, that you locate the center of the product in the center of the\nblanks.\nLab VI: TOOLING FABRICATION\nStudents will machine their molds using the CNC machine tools in the laboratory.\nLab VII: PARTS PRODUCTION\nStudents will use the injection molding and the thermoforming machine to produce enough parts for fifty assembled products.\nStudents are expected to optimize the process for the desired quality features and to become proficient in the operation of the\ninjection molding and thermoforming machines before beginning the production run. Student teams will divide\nresponsibilities to permit molding, trimming and sequence numbering for the creation of a run chart. During the production,\nat about fifty pieces, a process parameter (e.g. cooling time, or sheet thickness) is to be altered to simulate a process\ndisturbance to induce a mean shift of a part feature dimension.\nLab VIII: PRODUCT INSPECTION\nInjection molded parts should be allowed to cool for a minimum of 30 minutes before measuring. Select one dimension on\neach injection molded part and one dimension on each thermoformed part to study the dimensional variation in\nmanufacturing. Preferably the critical feature dimensions involved with the snap-fit aspect of the design.\nDELIVERABLES\nYou are required to submit 4 reports as indicated below during the Discrete Parts Manufacturing progression. A statement\nshould accompany each report attributing authorship, by section, to an individual student, and a joint evaluation of the\nrelative contribution of each group/team member to the entire Discrete Parts Manufacturing exercise. Each group/team\nmember must sign this statement. Your statement should appear as:\n\nStudent A\n20%\n\nStudent C\n25%\n\nStudent E 30%\n\nStudent B\n15%\n\nStudent D\n10%\n\n2.008 - Design & Manufacturing II -3- The Discrete Parts Manufacturing\n\nDefinitions: A 'Group' is the entire Yo-yo group. A 'Team' is a pair of students within the group responsible for their\nassigned parts. Grading: The entire 'Group' will receive a common grade on group reports. Each 'Team' will receive a\ngrade on their particular team report.\n\nDo not forget to include the agenda and minutes for each meeting.\n\nEach report should contain the following:\n\nReport 1: (10 points) Group report, due one week after the lab, at the beginning of the\nnext lab session.\n1. An outline of the planned division of labor for the complete lab progression (i.e. who's doing what\nfor Labs V, VI, VII, VIII)\n2. Fully dimensioned drawings of each of the parts using Mastercam, or Solidworks.\n3. An assembly drawing.\n4. An explanation of how you incorporated the design requirements into the features of your product\ndesign.\nReport 2: (10 points) Team report, due one week after the lab, at the beginning of the\nnext lab session.\n1. A fully dimensioned Mastercam, or Solidworks drawing of the molds.\n\n2. The complete set of G-code programs for machining the mold component. Send the completed\nprograms to the appropriate folders on crossshop1, or crossshop2, identify by including your Athena\nusername in the file name. Please do not print the code.\n\n3. A justification for the dimensions you have established for your mold contours (i.e. how did you\ncalculate your shrinkage allowances?)\n\n4. Select any 10 blocks of the G-code from one of your programs, the blocks must be in sequence. Print\njust the 10 blocks and submit an explanation of what the blocks of code are doing. For the lathe\nselect movement blocks since the meaning of some of the lathe code isn't covered in lab.\n\nReport 3: (15 points) Team report, due April 9th by 5PM for all lab groups.\n\n1. Justification and discussion of the process optimization and possible mold redesign.\n\nReport 4: (10 points) Group Report, due April 30th by 5PM for all lab groups.\n1. A run chart showing the relevant dimensional features of each component part. (i.e. a run chart for\nthe dimension measured during production. A separate chart for each part.)\n2. A histogram of the critical dimensions which you monitored during your production run.\n3. Plot a Shewhart X-bar chart. Explain how you chose the size of your \"rational subgroup.\" Where did\nyou place the control limits and why? Can you detect the step change induced by the parameter\nchange you made midway through your production run? Why or why not?\n4. What is the process capability, Cp, for your process, given the spec range you indicated in the\nexercise undertaken in Lab IV?\n\n5. What were the restrictions (number of components, material, process limitation, etc.) on the part\ndesign? Suggest an alternative design when there are no restrictions (mechanical drawings are not\nrequired).\n\n2.008 - Design & Manufacturing II -4- The Discrete Parts Manufacturing"

The molten polymer has too low viscosity.\nInjection pressure is too high, or clamping force is too weak.\nSolution\nAvoiding excessive difference in thickness is most effective.\nSlow down the injection speed.\nApply well-balanced pressure to the mold to get consistent clamping force, or\nincrease the clamping force.\nEnhance the surface quality of the parting lines, ejector pins and holes.\n2.008-spring-2004 S.

Kim\nMold cooling\nMolding cycle can be shortened by reducing time for cooling and\nsolidification of molten plastics.\nSolidification time, t thickness2/α, thermal diffusitivity\nWarpage or stress in a part can be generated when mold shrinkage\nvaries due to different thickness, leading internal residual stress\ndifference.\nEven cooling\n2.008-spring-2004 S. Kim\nWarpage\nThis deformation appears when the part is removed from the mold and\npressure is released.\nCause\nUneven shrinkage due to the mold temperature difference (surface\ntemperature difference at cavity and core), and the thickness difference in\nthe part. Injection pressure was too low and insufficient packing.\nSolution\nTake a longer cooling time and lower the ejection speed. Adjust the ejector\npin position or enlarge the draft angle. Examine the part thickness or\ndimension. Balance cooling lines. Increase packing pressure.\n2.008-spring-2004 S.
