  "syllabus_content": "Course Meeting Times\n\nLectures: 6 sessions / 12 weeks, 2 hours / session\n\nGood Scientific Communication\n\nIf the goal of science is to contribute to our understanding of the natural world, then the goal of scientific writing is to communicate that understanding with precision, accuracy, and economy.\n\nIn this portion of the course, you will develop your skills as a writer of scientific research, skills that will contribute to your learning of course material and to creating your identity as a scientist. Writing exercises - both in class and out - will have you explore the genre of the research article and its components and develop your grasp of the material you are learning in the 7.02 laboratory.\n\nIn this way, writing will be both a tool of communicating and a tool of learning. In addition, you will develop your skills as a writer, reviser, and editor - working with your peers and your instructor - and, ultimately, develop a solid foundation for writing up your future independent research.\n\nCourse syllabus (\nPDF\n)\n\nInstructors and Class Meetings\n\nStudents in 7.02, Experimental Biology and Communication select a Scientific Communications (\"SciComm\") section, each taught by an instructor from the Program in Writing and Humanistic Studies department at MIT. SciComm sections meet six times over the course of the semester. Each session consists of lectures and in-class activities as described in the Class Methods section below.\n\nClass Objectives\n\nAt the conclusion of this class, students will be able to:\n\nUnderstand the seven components (title, abstract, introduction, methods, results, discussion/conclusion, tables/figures) of a laboratory research paper.\n\nUnderstand the writing process and its application to scientific writing.\n\nUnderstand the importance of communicating in writing as a scientist.\n\nApply an understanding of scientific writing to their subsequent independent research.\n\nClass Methods\n\nIn-class Activities\n\nDuring each class session you will be engaged in a variety of writing activities that use self-editing, peer-editing, and instructor feedback to develop your skills. The goal of these exercises is to limber you up and make you more flexible as writers, revisers, and editors. They will also prepare you for the out-of-class writing assignments.\n\nIn addition, during each session three or four students will be responsible for a brief (no more than 5 minutes each) oral presentation on a particular aspect of an assigned research article. The four assigned roles for these presentation are to 1) summarize the article, 2) analyze the article according to the goals of that particular component of a scientific research paper, 3) analyze the article according to the pitfalls of that particular component of a scientific research paper, 4) act as a discussion leader and ask two to three open-ended questions to class.\n\nOut-of-Class Writing\n\nOut-of-class exercises will put in-class experience to work on scientific content. You will experiment with the relationship between audience and style/format, as well as explore and critique writing the readings assigned for each class. Further descriptions of out-of-class exercises will be provided during each class meeting.\n\nLong-Term Project\n\nIn addition to various in-class and out-of-class exercises, you will be asked to choose one on-going writing project. Each choice will require that you turn in sections of the whole at each class meeting and regularly revise those sections based on instructor and peer feedback. You will then hand in a final version of your project at the end of the semester.\nPlease note:\nThe first section to your long-term project - the introduction - will be due before the second class meeting and some preliminary work on your project will be done at the first class meeting; thus, please make your topic choice as soon as possible.\n\nGrading\n\nAcTIVITIES\n\nPERCENTAGES\n\nIn-class Work\n\nAttendance and Participation (In Discussion and In Writing Activities)\n\nOral Presentation\n\nProvides Useful Feedback on his/her Peers' Writing (Peer Tutoring)\n\n20%\n\nOut-of-class Work\n\nA) Professional Improvement\n\nB) Five Non-long Term Project Writing Assignments (To be Announced)\n\n30%\n\nLong-Term Project\n\nA) Long-term Project (LTP) Drafts (25%)\n\n1. LTP Intro Draft\n\n2. LTP Methods Draft\n\n3. LTP Results Draft\n\n4. LTP Figures draft\n\n5. LTP Discussion draft\n\nB) Long-term Project Title and Abstract (5%)\n\nC) Long-term Project Final Draft (20%)\n\n50%\n\nRevision Policy and Grading Schemes\n\nRevision policy\n\nA major part of the scientific writing process is revision, and thus you will have the opportunity to rewrite your SciComm \"out of class\" assignments and your LTP drafts. Revision will improve not only your writing but also your score on that assignment. The following guidelines govern rewrites in 7.02 / 10.702 SciComm:\n\nOne\nrewrite is allowed for each assignment.\n\nRewrites must be turned in by\none week\nafter assignment is returned.\n\nHigher score of the two is recorded.\n\nGrading of Oral Presentations\n\nGRADE\n\nPRESENTATION QUALITY INFORMATION\n\n+\n\nSuperior presentation. Talk has structure/organization; presenter has good eye contact/rapport with audience; speaks clearly and correctly. Uses visuals where appropriate.\n\n√+\n\nGood presentation. Requires only minor improvements in any of the areas above.\n\n√\n\nAcceptable presentation. Requires moderate improvements in one or more of the areas above.\n\n√-\n\nPoor presentation (doesn't care or prepare)\n\nFails to complete oral presentation.\n\nGrading of Writing Assignments\n\nGRADE\n\nQUALITY OF WRITING EMBODIED BY THIS SCORE\n\n+\n\nThoroughly superior work. A model of good scientific writing.\n\n√+\n\nGood work. Requires only minor improvements in any of the following areas: organization of ideas; economy of expression; diction (word choice); grammar/punctuation/spelling.\n\n√\n\nAcceptable work. Requires moderate revision in one or more of the areas above.\n\n√-\n\nAcceptable but rough work. Requires substantial revision in all areas.\n\n-\n\nUnacceptable work.\n\nAssignment not handed in.\n\nAdditional Information\n\nPolicy on Absences\n\nStudents are required to attend all class meetings. In accordance with MIT policy, students unable to attend classes or participate in any exam, study, or work requirement on a particular day because of their religious beliefs are excused from such activities. Students who need to miss a class session must attend another section meeting (with prior permission of the instructor) covering the same material (Introduction, Methods, etc). Absence from class due to illness requires documentation from the Counseling Dean's Office.\n\nLate Work\n\nAll work is due on announced date except in the event of a documented medical excuse. For all final drafts, one letter grade will be deducted for each day late until a grade of\nF\nis reached.\n\nAcademic Honesty\n\nPlagiarism is intentionally or unintentionally using the ideas or writings of another person without properly documenting and giving credit to the source. It will\nnot\nbe tolerated. Plagiarized work will receive zero credit and may result in the student failing the course. If you have any questions about what constitutes plagiarism, see one of the Instructors.",

      "content": "7.02/10.702 Spring 2005\nLong Term Project Choices\n7.02/10.702--Scientific Communication (SciComm)\nLONG TERM PROJECT CHOICES\nIn addition to various in-class and out-of-class exercises, you will be asked to choose\none on-going writing project. Each choice will require that you turn in sections of the\nwhole at each class meeting and regularly revise those sections based on instructor and\npeer feedback. You will then hand in a final version of your project at the end of the\nsemester by May 6. Please note: The first section to your long-term project--the\nintroduction--will be due before the second class meeting and some preliminary work on\nyour project will be done at the first class meeting; thus, please make your choice as soon\nas possible!\nChoices are as follows:\n#1--7.02/10.702 Experience: Write a reflective research article on yourself as a student learning\nthe laboratory techniques and biological content of 7.02/10.702.\nYour own learning is the subject of inquiry or data set for this research project, and you\nwill apply the features of biological research writing to report on--and better\nunderstand--what it is you are learning in 7.02/10.702 lecture and lab. The idea here is\nof reflective learning; your 7.02/10.702 experience will be enhanced if you go beyond\ntreating your learning as mere dictation or rote imitation. By writing about your\nlearning--and thus gaining a measure of control over what you know and what you\nstill need to know--you will ultimately learn more. This process also mimics the\nthinking process required of any researcher, whether in biology or other fields. You do\nnot merely generate lists of potential experiments, or interesting questions to pursue, or\nexperimental data, but instead you constantly question why you are making those\nchoices, what the potential and actual results might be, and what those results might\nmean in the context of what we already know about the \"problem.\" You will study and\npresent your learning using the structure of a scientific research article, and for each\nclass session a writing assignment will be due under these headings:\nIntroduction: Establish the context for yourself as a learner coming in to\n7.02/10.702, justify the course in some larger sense (how does it fit within\nyour \"bigger picture\"), establish specific goals for your learning and describe\nhow you will measure that learning (i.e., what your learning will look like).\nMethods: Focus on how you've learned the lecture and lab material. What has\nyour studying looked like (e.g., in groups, alone, specific procedures,\nstrategies)? What has your performance in lab looked like? Be sure you\nclearly define what you mean by \"learning\" and how you've measured it.\nIllustrations: Create at least two illustrations (figures or tables) to demonstrate\nthe methods or results of your study of your learning in 7.02/10.702.\nResults: Present the results of your learning in 7.02/10.702. What have you\nlearned in terms of scientific content? What have you learned about yourself\nas a learner?\nDiscussion/Conclusion: Were your results as you expected (i.e., match the\nspecific goals you established in your introduction)? Why or why not? How\n\n7.02/10.702-SciComm Syllabus\np. 2\nSpring 2005\nmight you have designed your study differently to accomplish your\nintentions? What are the larger implications of your results?\nTitle and Abstract: Create a succinct, descriptive title and a comprehensive\nabstract for your study.\nThe final graded project will be a research article of 10-15 double-spaced pages in\nlength, along with a title page, and a summary letter of transmittal describing your\nproject and its construction.\n#2--Mendel Paper: Use selected data and related aspects of the experimental design from\nMendel's original paper to write a shortened, more contemporary scientific paper. *\nYou are Gregor Mendel at the completion of his famous experiments with pea plants.\nUse the knowledge you gain in this course about scientific writing to create a shortened\nversion of Mendel's work. Your paper should focus only on the findings in pea plants\nthat support of the law of segregation (monohybrid crosses) and the law of\nindependent assortment (dihybrid crosses). Do not paraphrase Mendel's original\npaper. Write a completely new paper. Use Mendel's original paper only as a resource\nfor the experimental design and his original data. Keep in mind that Mendel did not\nknow about chromosomes, genes, alleles, or DNA.\nMendel's original paper and other resources describing what scientists thought about\ninheritance in the late 1800's can be found on MendelWeb: http://www.mendelweb.org.\nThese include a chapter on Mendelian genetics, an essay entitled \"Mendel, Mendelism,\nand Genetics\" by Robert C. Olby, an essay entitled \"What Did Gregor Mendel Think He\nDiscovered?\" by Daniel L. Hartl and Vitezslav Orel, and materials related to Darwin's\ntheory of evolution, which was introduced at about the same time.\nMendel's original paper is over 40 pages long. Your final draft should be about 10-15\npages double-spaced. Revisions are a crucial part of the project. At each class meeting\nyou will receive feedback on your previously submitted section. It will be your\nresponsibility to incorporate this feedback and adjust other sections to make a final\npaper that is coherent and flows from beginning to end. Please include a title page and\na cover letter with your final draft. All figures should be grouped at the end of the\ndocument.\n*Variants of this choice are welcome, but subject to instructor approval, e.g., Thomas\nHunt Morgan's work with fruit flies that led to linkage analysis.\n#3--Oswald Avery paper: Use selected data and related aspects of the experimental design from\nAvery et al.'s original paper isolating DNA as the \"active principle\" involved in transfer of\ngenetic material and write a shortened, more persuasive, and more contemporary scientific paper.\nIn his essay, \"The Birth of Molecular Biology,\" S. Michael Halloran points to the 1944\nAvery et al. Journal of Experimental Medicine article as an example of a groundbreaking\nscientific finding that reached a very limited audience primarily due to the ways in\nwhich the paper was written. According to Halloran, \"[a] characteristic point of [the\nauthors'] argumentative strategy is that the paper does not state its thesis in the\n\n7.02/10.702-SciComm Syllabus\np. 3\nSpring 2005\nintroductory section and in fact does not even mention the substance DNA until\nroughly half-way through its 7500 word length.\" Halloran goes on to describe the paper\nas \"rhetorically weak.\"\nIn this long-term project, your task is to make Avery et al.'s argument \"rhetorically\nstrong\" by re-fashioning their experimental work in an updated form.\nBackground on Oswald Avery's life and work, as well as his notes surrounding the 1944\npaper, can be found at the National Library of Medicine's Profiles in Science website:\nhttp://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/CC/. The Journal of Experimental Medicine article itself can\nbe found at that website and on the SciComm \"Writing Lectures\" page.\nYour final graded project will be a research article of 10-15 double-spaced pages in\nlength, along with a title page, and a summary letter of transmittal describing your\nproject and its construction.\n#4--UROP: Use the data and experimental design from your independent research to compose a\nresearch article suitable for publication in a scholarly journal.\nWrite a formal research article presenting your undergraduate research. You must have\nsufficient data at the beginning of the semester to undertake this project. Specifically,\nyou must have enough data to develop a substantial results section with convincing\nillustrations. Students who have just begun their undergraduate research should make\nanother choice.\nThis exercise is intended to be on going and iterative. Revisions are a crucial part of the\nproject. At each class meeting you will turn in a new section and receive instructor\nfeedback on your previously submitted section. It will be your responsibility to\nincorporate instructor feedback and to make your own modifications to previous\nsections so the end result is coherent and flows from beginning to end.\nYour final paper should be about 10-15 pages double-spaced. Please include a title page\nand a cover letter with your final draft. All figures should be grouped at the end of the\ndocument. Consult the BCM Guide for Authors for other details.\n#5--Interviews: Investigate the process of writing scientific research and the \"norms\" of well-\nwritten research articles by interviewing working scientists and collecting examples.\nStudents choosing this project will \"go out into the field\" in the manner of an\nanthropologist or social scientist in order to investigate the research article from the\nperspective of working scientists. For each section (introduction, materials and\nmethods, illustrations, results, conclusion/discussion, title and abstract) you will need\nto interview three our four scientific professionals in terms of the following:\n-\nWhat does the scientist see as the criteria for a well-written introduction (or\nmethods, etc.)?\n-\nHow does that scientist describe his or her process for writing that particular\n\n7.02/10.702-SciComm Syllabus\np. 4\nSpring 2005\nsection?\n-\nHave the scientist point you to one or two specific examples of well-written\nresearch articles that you will present in your report.\nFor each section, you will then present your findings from those you interviewed,\nnoting similarities and differences in responses, and also present your analysis of what\nmakes the textual examples particularly effective.\nThe final graded project will be a research article of 10-15 double-spaced pages in\nlength, along with a title page, and a summary letter of transmittal describing your\nproject and its construction.\n#6--Textual Analysis: Conduct a textual analysis of a series of scientific research articles on a\nsingle topic.\nFor a topic that particularly interests you, find at least four research articles that you can\nunderstand and present to a lay reader. For each section of the research article\n(introduction, materials and methods, illustrations, results, conclusion/discussion, title\nand abstract), you will conduct a textual analysis of how the authors \"do the work\" of\nwriting up scientific research (for examples of this sort of analysis, see S. Michael\nHalloran's \"The Birth of Molecular Biology: An Essay in the Rhetorical Criticism of\nScientific Discourse,\" and Gopen and Swan's \"The Science of Scientific Writing, both\navailable on the SciComm web page). Keep in mind that for each section of your paper,\nyou will be presenting to your reader both the content of the research articles or what\nthe authors have to say about the topic and the rhetoric of the articles or how the authors\nhave constructed their arguments.\nOverall, your approach to this task should be governed by the content and arguments\nof the articles themselves. For example, some topics lend themselves to an analysis of\nhow the writing up of the research has changed over time. Another variation is to offer\nanalysis of each section of the four articles, e.g., comparing/contrasting the\nintroductions, the methods, the results, the discussion/conclusions, the title and\nabstract. With this approach it is essential that you provide appropriate examples to\nsupport your analysis.\nStill another variation is to write your analysis in a more \"traditional\" way: In your\nintroduction, you'll need to introduce your reader to your project--Why you chose that\ntopic and why it is important, how you've generally approached the analysis, and what\nyou hope to gain. In your methods, you would describe in detail your means of\nanalysis. In your results, you'd offer the comparison/contrast of the articles themselves.\nIn your discussion, you would offer explanations for the similarities and differences.\nThe final graded project will be a research article of 10-15 double-spaced pages in\nlength, along with a title page, and a summary letter of transmittal describing your\nproject and its construction."
