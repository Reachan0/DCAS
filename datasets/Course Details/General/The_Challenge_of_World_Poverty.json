  "course_name": "The Challenge of World Poverty",
  "course_description": "This is a course for those who are interested in the challenge posed by massive and persistent world poverty, and are hopeful that economists might have something useful to say about this challenge. The questions we will take up include: Is extreme poverty a thing of the past? What is economic life like when living under a dollar per day? Why do some countries grow fast and others fall further behind? Does growth help the poor? Are famines unavoidable? How can we end child labor—or should we? How do we make schools work for poor citizens? How do we deal with the disease burden? Is micro finance invaluable or overrated? Without property rights, is life destined to be “nasty, brutish and short”? Has globalization been good to the poor? Should we leave economic development to the market? Should we leave economic development to non-governmental organizations (NGOs)? Does foreign aid help or hinder? Where is the best place to intervene?\nMITx Online Version\nThis course is part of the Micromaster’s Program in Data, Economics, and Design of Policy through MITx Online. The course is entirely free to audit, though learners have the option to pay a fee, which is based on the learner’s ability to pay, to take the proctored exam, and earn a course certificate.

  "syllabus_content": "Course Meeting Times\n\nLectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session\n\nRecitations: 1 session / week, 1 hour / session\n\nInstructors\n\nProf. Esther Duflo (first half of semester)\n\nProf. Abhijit V. Banerjee (second half of semester)\n\nPrerequisites\n\nThere are no prerequisites for this course. However, economics is a mathematical science so math will appear, in small doses, in two forms. First, this course is empirically-oriented, so almost all of the required readings and lectures will, at times, use elementary statistics to describe the world. In addition, a handful of the required readings will use more advanced statistical tools (such as correlations and regressions) to dig deeper into the data. However, the recitations for this course will go over these more advanced concepts in detail, so no prior knowledge is required. Second, the lectures will occasionally discuss simple mathematical models that economists find helpful to describe some aspects of the data. The intuition behind these models will, however, always be made clear, and can be used as a substitute (for the purposes of your understanding, and when answering exam questions) for mathematics.\n\nText, Films, and Readings\n\nRequired Textbook\n\nBanerjee, Abhijit, and Esther Duflo.\nPoor Economics: A Radical Rethinking of the Way to Fight Global Poverty\n. PublicAffairs, 2011. ISBN: 9781586487980.\n\nWe will also rely on articles and chapters of other books. Required readings are starred and need to be read\nbefore\nthe lecture that they are listed under. Additional readings are not required, but will aid your understanding of the lecture material. Lecture notes will be distributed at each lecture. They are\nnot\na substitute for attending the class, but rather a study aide. In order to motivate some of the issues discussed in the lectures and readings, we will watch a handful of short films during some of the lectures, listed in the calendar.\n\nGrading\n\nACTIVITIES\n\nPERCENTAGES\n\nPop quizzes\n\n30%\n\nFinal exam\n\n40%\n\nWritten assignments\n\n30%\n\nGrading rubric for written assignments (PDF)\n\nPop Quizzes\n\nThirty points of the grade will be based on pop quizzes, which will take place in the lectures on randomly chosen occasions. These will be short, multiple-choice quizzes that are designed to test that you have completed the required reading for each lecture before each lecture. Attendance at lectures is compulsory and any missed quizzes will receive a grade of zero.\n\nFinal Exam\n\nForty points of the grade will be based on a final exam to be administered in final exam week. The exam will be based on the required readings throughout the year as well as the lecture material covered in class and recitations. It will be a mixture of multiple choice and written questions, and take three hours or less.\n\nWritten Assignments\n\nThirty points of the grade will be based on five short written assignments that you will be expected to hand in to the TA at recitations. Each written assignment will be approximately 500 words in length, and should be focused on a lecture's required reading material. The course material described above is broken down into 26 lectures organized around 10 topics (Introduction, Consumption, Education, Health, Family, Insurance, Credit, Savings, Entrepreneurship, and Political economy). There will be one written assignment proposed, therefore, per topic. The assignment for each topic is due by the first recitation to occur after the last lecture that covers that topic. Your grade on these written assignments will be based on the best five written assignments that you submit over the year.\n\nThe subject of these written assignments can be either: (a) your answer to a question that has been suggested by the TA on each lecture's required reading; or (b), an opinion piece on a topic of your choice (be sure it's something you find interesting) related to the lecture's required reading (feel free to discuss this in advance with your TA if you like). In either case, you are expected to state a thesis up front, discuss why your reader should care about the topic you've chosen, and argue in favor of it. A book report or other type of non-critical summary is not acceptable. These assignments are to be completed individually and in your own words.\n\nBecause 500 words is very short your written argument should be concise and punchy, and be high on content and opinion. It will take some time to compose one possible strategy is to write a 1000 word piece and edit it down to 500 words so that you are left with only the essential argument.\n\nExamples of Potential Paper Topics\n\nForeign aid should be limited to countries with good governance.\n\nThe one dollar-a-day poverty standard is misleading and should be abandoned.\n\nLocal accountability is critical to providing effective education.\n\nNational standards, funding, and accountability are the keys to improving education.\n\nMicrofinance institutions need to be closely regulated.\n\nExcessive regulation will kill microfinance.",

Two NGOs try to get funding for their program. One NGO provides a\nfipchart in its schools. It costs only 3 dollars per classroom (of about 50\nchildren) and lasts 3 years. Another NGO provides a laptop per child: it\n\ncosts 200 per child and is also expected to last for 3 years.

State two explanations for why better enforcement of property rights may\nraise incomes, and discuss some of the challenges faced in obtaining em\npirical evidence that would test these explanations.\n21. Acemoglu, Johnson and Robinson present three correlations in the data on\nexcolonies: (i) the correlation between good property rights in 1995 and\nGDP in 1995 is positive; (ii) the correlation between good property rights\nin 1995 and settler mortality is negative; and (iii), the correlation between\nGDP in 1995 and settler mortality is negative. Explain how these authors\nuse these three correlations to argue that good property rights in 1995\ncause high GDP in 1995. Describe the key assumption that the authors\nare making and provide one criticism of this assumption.\n22. State the main reason, according to Anne Krueger, for the World Bank's\ncreation and compare this to what you see as the principal activity of the\nWorld Bank in the past 20 years.

And\neven harder to predict what population increase\nwould do to the planet...\n\nAre large families worst off?\n- Perhaps we can say more about the family\n- Note that this is not necessarily the entire answer to\nwhat population growth does to countries or the\nworld:\n- Families may not fully take into account the impact of their\nfertility on others in the community (local, country,\nworld...)\n- However, it is still an important question:\n- If true, could give a reason to subsidize/encourage family\nplanning, for the sake of children (who do not decide)\n- We need to understand the cost and benefits of large\nfamily to design effective policies\n\nThe quality-Quantity Trade off\n- Becker and Tommes (1976) describe the\n\"quality quantity\" trade-off parents face\n- Siblings compete for resources (parental attention,\nmoney etc.) so more children means that each get\nfewer\n- The paper observed that if \"quality\" is a normal\ngood, then poor parents will tend to want to have\nmore children.\n\nIs there a quality quantity trade off\n- We cannot look at children in large and small\nfamilies: in Becker's world, family size is a\nchoice and it is the family who cares less\nabout quality that will go for large family.\n- Look at exogenous changes in family size.\n- \"Fertility shocks\"\n- Exogenous reduction in family size\n\nFertility shocks\n- Twins:\n- 2 kids when you expected just one!\n- Will increase family size but not one for one\n(why?)\n- However:\n- We cannot look at the twins themselves. Why?\n- Even looking at other kids may be misleading, if kids\ndemand more attention than other kids.\n\nFertility shocks\n- Gender:\n- In the US, parents want mixed family: Families\nthat have had one boy and one girl are less likely\nto have a third child than family who had two boys\nor two girls.\n- In developing countries: further shock due to\ngender of the child- if parents have a preference\nfor having a boy. Girls will tend to be born in large\nfamilies.\n- However, sex may not be random any more due to sex-\nselective abortion.\n\nEvidence from Israel\n- Angrist, Lavy, Schlosser\n- The evidence comes from using both twins\nand gender composition\n- It includes Israeli Arabs who are quite poor.\n- Find no effect at all!\n\nImpact of Forced reduction: China One\nchild policy\n- Since 1978-79, Chinese government severely\nrestricts the number of a children a family can\nhave\n- Each couple can have only one child, or is\nsubjected to heavy fine\n- However, since mid 1980s, relaxation in some\nareas if the first child is a girl.\n- She compares girls, in areas had a relaxation\npolicy, after the policy was put in places\n\nGirls live in larger families in relaxed\nareas\nFigure 3A: The Effect of Relaxation on Family Size\nCoefficients of the Interactions between\nBorn in a Relaxed Area * Birth Regions\n0.05\n0.1\n0.15\n0.2\n0.25\n0.3\n0.35\n0.4\n0.45\n0.5\n1973 1974 1975 1976 1977 1978 1979 1980 1981\nBirth Year\nGirls\nBoys\n\n(c) Nancy Qian.

However:\n- May be the trade off kicks off later?\n- May be it is good for girls to have a sibling (who is\nall too often a brother...): both kids gets educated\n\nOne more \"normal\" example\n- The Matlab program, in Bengladesh, provided\nwomen in treatment areas with regular access to\ncontraceptive, a Community Health Worker that\nvisited women at home, etc.\n- Initially, there was a fairly large decline in fertility\nin the treatment areas:\n- By 1996 women in Treatment areas had 1.2 fewer\nchildren.\n- However, by 1996 no difference in height, weight,\nschool enrollment, years of education of children\nborn in T and C areas...\n\nIs contraception availability the key\nbarrier?\n- The other part of the conventional wisdom on\npopulation policy is that lack of availability of\ncontraceptive is way to reduce fertility\n- Concept of \"unmet demand\" for\ncontraceptive.\n- But what is the impact of making\ncontraceptive available on reducing family\nsize?\n\nEvidence from Colombia\n- A family planning program was introduced in\nColombia by a a young doctor.\n- The program did reduce fertility\n\nCourtesy of Grant Miller. Used with permission.\n\nEvidence from Colombia\n- A family planning program was introduced in\nColombia by a a young doctor.\n- The program did reduce fertility\n- But the effects were low:\n- 5% more kids per woman\n- 1/10 of the total fertility decline in Colombia over\nthe 1960s\n\nWhat about Matlab?\n- Matlab was a succesful program to reduce\nfertility\n- However the effects became lower over time\nas fertility declined in the country overall\n- It may have accelerated a trend, by changing\npreferences, rather than reducing the cost of\ncontraception per se.\n- What determine preferences on family size?\n\nWhat determine preferences on\nfertility\n- Social norms\n- What your neighbor do (Matlab)\n- But also, what you see in Television:\n- In Brazil, fertility declined faster in regions where\nTelenovelas became available first\n- Telenovelas present the image of a \"small, happy\nfamily\"\n- Costs and benefits of both sex and\npregnancies.\n\nHIV prevention and teen pregnancy in\nKenya\n- Adolescents are the \"window of hope\" in the\nprevention of HIV:\n- Still uninfected\n- Their sexual pattern may not be set yet.\n- Programs are developed for schools, with help of\nUNICEF only, but they are a little bit limited by\nsocial norms of what can be taught in school\n- ABCD strategy. But really, only A and B in schools\nin Keny: abstain till marriage.\n- Danger: that kids will decide to get married!\n\nA test: Duflo, Dupas, Kremer\n- In 2002-2003 376 schools were randomly\nassigned to one of 4 groups:\n- CONTROL\n- Teacher training for HIV education: official\ncuriculum\n- Free uniform for all children in grade 7 and 8\n- Kids were followed several years later (until\n2011)\n\nMain Finding: Education, girls\n\n0.81\n0.82\n0.83\n0.84\n0.85\n0.86\n0.87\n0.88\nControl\nUniforms\nTeacher Training\nBoth\nCompleted primary school\n\nMain finding: Pregnancy\n\n0.22\n0.23\n0.24\n0.25\n0.26\n0.27\n0.28\n0.29\n0.3\n0.31\nControl\nUniforms\nTeacher Training\nBoth\nEver pregnant\n\nMain Finding: HSV2\n\n0.02\n0.04\n0.06\n0.08\n0.1\n0.12\nControl\nUniforms\nTeacher Training\nBoth\nHSV2 positive\n\nThe explanation\n- What is the explanation for these curious\nfindings?\n- Why is the combined program the most\neffective at reducing HSV2, but in between for\npregnancies?\n- What does it tell us about girls's ability to \"say\nno\" (or other form of control...).\n\nUnderstanding family decisions\n- Since it now clear that fertility, like other decision, is a\ndecision, we need to understand why it is the best idea\nfor a poor family to have many children\n- Affecting those factors is more likely to affect fertility\nrates and teenage pregnancies than just distributing\ncontraceptive\n- It does not mean that contraceptives is not a good\nidea! It allows people to control the timing of their\nfertility and live a happier lives. Also, even if on average\nfertility is not very much affected by contraception\nability, it may make a big difference to an individual's\nlife.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n14.73 The Challenge of World Poverty\nSpring 2011\n\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

      "content": "Education: The Man Made Trap\nAbhijit Banerjee and Esther Duflo\n14.73, Lecture 11\n\nWhat we have seen so far\n- There are clear benefits of education, both\nmonetary and non-monetary.\n- These benefits are experienced even by those\nwho complete just some more years of\nprimary education (like in Indonesia)\n\nWhat we have seen so far\n- However, the quality of education is very\npoor: schools deliver little to the poor\n- And yet, it does not seem that difficult to\nimprove quality a lot: Pratham's programs\nshow tremendous progress with high school\ngraduates.\n\nWhat could be going on?\n\nAn illusory S-Shape\n- Parents tend to believe that education is a lottery\nticket:\n- In Madagascar, 70% of parents thought that a\nsecondary education could lead to a government job.\nIn fact, 33% of secondary school graduates get one.\n- Parent tend to believe that returns to primary\neducation are low, and returns to higher\neducation higher\n- Madagascar: 6% per year for primary education, 12%\nper year for secondary education, 20% for tertiary\neducation\n\nMadagascar: real and perceived\nreturns to education\n7.9\n8.1\n8.3\n8.5\n8.7\n8.9\n9.1\n9.3\n9.5\nPreceived earnings\nActual earnings\n\nConsequence of Elite Bias in Education\n- The parents\n- The teachers\n- The students\n\nThe Parents\n1. Parents believe that a little bit of education\nmay not be worth the cost: unless the child\ncan get enough education to get a lottery\nticket, it is not worth it.\n2. If they have several children, they may decide\nto treat them unequally: make sure that one\ngets enough education, even if this means\nthat the other gets very little\n\nParents: Evidence\n- Parents are sensitive to perceived returns to\neducation when they make their education\ndecision.\n- In Madagascar, when they were shown the\nreturns to education in a simple way, parents\nwho were initially overestimating the returns\nreduced effort, and those who were\nunderstimating increased effort.\n\nCourtesy of Trang Nguyen. Used with permission.\n\nParents: Evidence\n- Parents discriminate between their children\n- In Burkina Faso, a study found that children are\nmore likely to be in school if they do well on a\ncognitive test, but less likely if their sibling's do\nwell (conditional on their own cognitive score)\n- In Colombia, another study found that when some\nkids were given a conditional cash transfer to stay\nin school, other kids were less likely to attend.\n\nParents: Evidence\n- Parents are sensitive to actual job\nopportunities that education open, but\nincreasing the opportunity may actually\nincrease inequality\n- Experiment in India (Robert Jensen): for 3\nyears, recruiters when to recruit boys and girls\nwho had english education for BPO centers.\n\nThe results of the BPO experiment\n- The results\n- BPO recruitment increased girls education\n- No average effect on boys BUT unequal effect:\n- Increase in education for boys whose parents said at\nbaseline they wanted to send them to the city\n- Decrease in education for boys whse parents said at\nbaseline they wanted to keep them in the farm.\n\nConsequence of Elite Bias in Education\n- The parents\n- The teachers\n- The students\n\nTeachers\n1. Teachers will teach to the top of the class,\neven when the majority of the students\ncannot follow what is going on\n2. If teachers feel that the majority of their\nstudents are not \"up to the mark\" they will\ntend to blame the students, or the parents,\nand lose motivation: low effort\n3. It will be difficult to convince teachers to\nchange their practices, even with training\n\nTeachers: The Evidence\n- The Pratham experiments provide evidence in\nthis direction:\n- The program was effective in teaching all children,\nbut teachers were not very interested in taking it\nup, except in the remedial summer camps\n- They can teach the basic, but they are not very\ninterested to do it....\n\nTeacher: The Evidence\n- An experiment in Kenya provides clear evidence\nof most of these points (Duflo, Dupas, Kremer)\n- 120 schools in Kenya were provided with an extra\nteacher to cut class 1 in two\n- In 60 schools teachers were randomly assigned to a\nclass\n- In 60 schools, students were divided into 2 groups\nbased on prior achievement.\n- What do we expect to see if teachers tend to\nteach to the top: the story in picture\n\nNo Tracking: Student Ability and Teaching Level\n\nNo Tracking: Student Ability and Teaching Level\n\nTracking: Low Student Ability and Teaching Level\n\nTracking: Low Student Ability and Teaching Level\n\nTracking: High Student Ability and Teaching Level\n\nTracking: High Student Ability and Teaching Level\n\nExpected results if teacher have elite\nbias\n- Teachers would teach at a lower level in the\nbottom track, so closer to what the low ability\nchildren can understand: that will help them\n- In the top track, students will not benefit from\nbetter targeting however:\n- They will have better peers\n- The teacher may work harder because he now mainly\nhas students he care about\n- So it is possible that everyone benefits from\ntracking\n\nThe results: Effect on teacher effort\n\n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\n(4)\n(5)\n(6)\nTeacher in\nschool\nIf in school,\nfound in\nclass\nteaching\nTeacher\nfound in\nclass\nteaching\n(uncon-\nditional on\npresence)\nTeacher in\nschool\nIf in school,\nfound in\nclass\nteaching\nTeacher\nfound in\nclass\nteaching\n(uncon-\nditional on\npresence)\nTracking School\n0.041\n0.079\n0.096\n0.054\n0.094\n0.112\n(0.021)**\n(0.039)**\n(0.038)**\n(0.025)**\n(0.047)**\n(0.044)**\nBottom Half x Tracking School\n-0.049\n-0.034\n-0.062\n-0.073\n-0.036\n-0.076\n\n(0.029)*\n(0.042)\n(0.040)\n(0.034)**\n(0.059)\n(0.053)\nObservations\nMean in Non-Tracking Schools\n0.837\n0.609\n0.510\n0.825\n0.545\n0.450\nF test\n2.718\n7.693\n9.408\n2.079\n4.414\n5.470\nProb >F\n0.011\n0.000\n0.000\n0.050\n0.000\n0.000\nAll Teachers\nCivil-Service Teachers\nCourtesy of Bureau for Research and Economic Analysis of Development.

The relationship become less and\nless strong for younger cohorts, and is about zero for the youngest cohorts\nCourtesy of Hoyt Bleakley and American Economic Association.

So what can it be?\n\nDo people care about their health?\n- Yes, they do:\n- Large amount of money spent on health care (up\nto 7% per month in the Udaipur survey)\n- But most of these is spent on curative care.\n- Large expenses\n- Often for care that is very invasive and of poor\nquality: too much treatment.\n\nAre governments to blame?\n- In a certain measure, yes:\n- Nurses are often absent: 35% on average in a survey\nconducted by the world bank.\n- Even when they are there, governments doctors and\nnurses do not treat patient very well\n- 3 minutes, 3 questions, 3 medicines!\n- But even when services are good, people do not\nalways get them: for example in the\nimmunization camps, only 12% of people got all\nthe shots: there is something about demand, not\nonly about supply!\n\nWhy the low demand\n- Two difficulties with preventive care:\n- It is difficult to learn what works\n- Benefits are in the future, and the cost is now.\n\nLearning about Health Care\n- Most diseases are self-limiting: they get better\nafter being worst.\n- If you start from the theory that a shot is needed,\nand someone is willing to give you that shot, then\nyou will usually feel better, and attribute it to the\nshot.\n- It will be harder to attribute it to nothing...\ntendency to overmedicate is always present (in\nrich and poor countries), and needs to be\nregulated away.\n\nPreventive care is worst\n- You take an action that prevents something from\nhappening.... A long time after the fact. Drawing\nthe link is difficult\n- If this is against a contagious disease, you may\nsee many non-immunized children who are not\nfalling sick either (same effect as with the\ndeworming).\n- You need to trust what you are told, and this trust\nis fragile:\n- MMR vaccine and autism in the US\n- Polio vaccine and sterilization in India\n\nNow or later\n- Another problem is that preventive health care costs\nare incurred today, but benefits are in the future.\n- Human beings tend to put too much weight on the\npresent, relative to the entire future:\n- You have no time to do your essay for this deadline\n- .... But you will (surely) have time later in the semester\n- Same thing for exercising, savings, etc.\n- Same problem with preventive care: parents may feel\nevery month that they will get the immunization next\nmonth.... But something else comes up, and they don't\nend up doing it.\n\nWhat this means for policy\n- Large benefits from making things\neasy/automatic for people:\n- Free Chlorin dispenser right where you collect\nyour water\n- Small incentives for immunization/compulsory\nimmunization if you can pull it off...\n- In many cases, the superficial cost benefit analysis\ngives you the wrong answer.\n- Charging a small amount may be counter-productive\n- Giving people small incentives may save you money\n\nSustainability is not what you think it is\n\n1.4\n4.26\n100%\nSubsidy\n90%\nSubsidy\nWith\nLentils\nWithout\nLentils\nNo Cost\nSharing\nWith cost\nsharing\nBednets: cost per life saved\n($)\nImmunization: Cost per\nimmunization ($)\nDeworming: Cost\nper Child treated\n($)\n\nWhat this means for policy\n- The role of learning and trust is key\n- There can be further benefit to early subsidies, if this\nleads to learning about benefits.\n- For example bednets (Dupas, 2010)\n- People who got them were more likely to pay for a second\none in the future\n- Neighbors of people who got one for free were more likely\nto pay for one if they had to pay.\n- Because preventive care is hard to teach, need to\nmaintain trust: important for governments to chose\ntheir battles. India lost credibility by lying to people\nabout sterilization, and recovering from this is very\ndifficult.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n14.73 The Challenge of World Poverty\nSpring 2011\n\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

      "content": "How do families decide?\n14.73 lecture 13\nAbhijit Banerjee and Esther Duflo\n\nDecisions...\n- We have seen in the previous lecture that\nfamilies appear to be quite in control of their\nfertility decision\n- But when we say \"families\" what do we\nmean?\n- The dad?\n- The mom?\n- The mother in law?\n\nThe family as a decision maker\n- This question is relevant for fertility, but of\ncourse for many other decisions as well:\n- How much food to buy?\n- Whether to go immunize a child?\n- How much to spend on a kid's education?\n- All these decisions are taken jointly by\nparents. Siblings, grand-parents, and even the\nconcerned child, may have a role as well...\n\nWhat model for the family\n- In all our discussions so far we have assumed\nthat \"the family\" decided like an individual:\nthe family was treated like a black box.\n- But that is surely not correct...\n- When can we ignore the family dynamics?\n- When one person decides for everyone\n- When everybody has exactly the same\npreferences\n\nWhat model for the family\n- In all our discussions so far we have assumed\nthat \"the family\" decided like an individual:\nthe family was treated like a black box.\n- But that is surely not correct...\n- When can we ignore the family dynamics?\n- When one person decides for everyone\n- When everybody has exactly the same\npreferences\n\nNeither of this seems very likely\n- Women and men have different preferences:\n- For example, women and men have often very different\nviews about how many children they want to have.\n- That is not very surprising since women bear the physical\nrisks and cost of having children.\n- Within a given family, people are different (e.g. one\ncould be more or less patient, more or less interested\nin education, etc.).\n- While the family is patriarchal in many developing\ncountries, women still make a number of decisions or\nparticipate in them.\n\nHow can we test the model?\n- In the \"unitary\" model of the family, the only things\nthat should matter for decision should be\n- Family overall income\n- Prices of things (including opportunity costs etc.)\n- Information available to anyone in the famil\n- However, if the family is not unitary, and instead the\nmembers bargain between themselves for a bigger\nshare of the pie, we should see other things appear:\n- Private Information (if people hide some things from each\nother)\n- Factors that affect the bargaining power of individual\nfamily members.\n\nDoes private information matter?\n- The case of fertility: Lusaka, Zambia (Ashraf, Field,\nVoenna)\n- Many women report hiding contraceptive from\ntheir husbands\n- Would an intervention that involves men and\nwomen together have a larger or smaller effect\nthan an intervention that involves just women?\nOr would they be the same\n- Important policy question: should men be\ninvolved or left out?\n\nExperimental design\n- Randomly assigned a voucher for a quick\nappointment with family planning nurse either\n- To wife alone\n- To wife and husband together.\n- Are women more likely to take up the voucher\nwhen they are spoken to alone?

Of migration?\n\nThe limits of informal insurance\n- Aggregate shocks:\n- Farmers can only insure each other if they know\nthemselves relatively well (close together,\nrelatives). It means that they only have limited\nscope for insurance\n- Limited size of the arrangement\n- In practice most insurance seems limited to\nbilateral relationship, not a pool: not very well\ndesigned to deal with large shock such as illness.\n\nHow about formal insurance ?\n- Forbes called microinsurance an\n\"unpenetrated natural market\"\n- The poor need insurance\n- They cannot pay much but there are many of\nthem\n- There should be money to be made!!\n\nWhere are the insurance companies?\n- And yet the attempts have been disappointing\n- Very low demand at actuarially fair price\n- And the insurance company charge more than a\nfair price!!

What if\nthey had insurance\n- Too little preventive care already\n- Adverse selection:\n- People who know to be sick may sign up: if insurer\ndoes not know\n- Fraud:\n- How to prevent doctors for charging for services they\ndo not perform?\n\nThe solution: Simple products\n- To avoid moral hazard and fraud:\n- Offer only catastrophic health insurance :\nhospitalization insurance, usually in a networked\nhospital which has been vetted\n- To avoid adverse selection\n- Make the insurance compulsory for a pre-selected\ngroup of people (e.g. clients of a microcredit\norganization)\n\nAnother example: crop insurance\n- Crop insurance is subject to moral hazard and\nadverse selection:\n- Taking care of your crop\n- Choosing insurance for a field that you know prone to\ndisaster\n- Offer weather insurance instead:\n- Based on an rainfall index at a nearby weather station\n- People can buy as much or as little as they can\n- No fraud, little administrative cost, no adverse\nselection, no moral hazard!\n\nAn offer in search of a demand\n- But the poor have little interest in these products\n- Lack of understanding (?)\n- Mistrust: how to explain the rules when they are at\nthe advantage of the insurer?\n- The product is not what they actually need or want:\n- Difficult to think ahead about a negative event:\n- few young people have burial insurance in South Africa, even\nthough burial is a major cost for their surviving relatives!\n\nCatch 22\n- The market is limited in what it can offer...\n- And it limited precisely in ways that makes\nwhat it can offer relatively unattractive to the\npoor\n- A very different situation then for microcredit,\nwhere the market is also very limited in what\nit can offer, but what it can offer suits at least\nsome people\n\nWhat role for public policy?\n- This opens an obvious role for public policy: step\nin to complement the market to insure social\nprotection.\n- But this could take several forms:\n- Food aid\n- Cash transfers\n- Free primary health care\n- Offer publicly provided insurance\n- Subsidize insurance offered by the market: perhaps\npeople will learn\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n14.73 The Challenge of World Poverty\nSpring 2011\n\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."
