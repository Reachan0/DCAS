  "syllabus_content": "Course Meeting Times\n\nLectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session\n\nCourse Objectives\n\nThe focus of Product Design and Development is integration of the marketing, design, and manufacturing functions of the firm in creating a new product. The course is intended to provide you with the following benefits:\n\nCompetence with a set of tools and methods for product design and development.\n\nConfidence in your own abilities to create a new product.\n\nAwareness of the role of multiple functions in creating a new product (e.g. marketing, finance, industrial design, engineering, production).\n\nAbility to coordinate multiple, interdisciplinary tasks in order to achieve a common objective.\n\nReinforcement of specific knowledge from other courses through practice and reflection in an action-oriented setting.\n\nEnhanced team working skills.\n\nExpectations\n\nThis is a 12-unit graduate course. Accordingly, the course has been designed to demand approximately 12 hours per week of your time. It is expected that each student will prepare for and attend all of the class sessions and will regularly enhance class discussions. Most important though are substantial and continuous contributions to the progress of the team project. Experience with project-based design courses is that students often develop high expectations for their projects and devote substantially more time than is required by the instructors. Faculty applaud this enthusiasm, but this course will not penalize students who establish a twelve hour per week average time constraint for their efforts.\n\nGrading\n\nACTIVITIES\n\nPERCENTAGES\n\nClass Participation\n\n20%\n\nIndividual Project Proposal\n\n10%\n\nTeam Assignments\n\n35%\n\nFinal Project Presentation\n\n35%\n\nCourse Materials\n\nUlrich, Karl, and Steven Eppinger.\nProduct Design and Development\n.\n3rd ed.

      "content": "Better Book Crate\n\nName, Degree graduation year, email, phone\n\nShelves built from crates have the huge advantage that they can be disassembled, moved,\nstored and assembled, leaving the contents (books, CDs, DVDs, ...) in the crates. This\nmakes moving much easier and cheaper than de-shelving books, placing them in separate\nboxes, disassembling the shelves, moving everything, building shelves and shelving\nbooks.\n\nHowever, none of the existing crates allows building a sturdy shelf. They start to cave in\nor lean once the third layer is stacked on top. Many crates can also not be carried easily\nonce filled. Some crates are too large making them too heavy when filled. Many crates do\nnot protect contents from dust or dirt, which is important for storing crates.\n\nHere is a list of needs:\n\nMust Have\n- Sturdy enough, possibly with some kind of locking mechanism, to allow building\nof large shelves (at least 5 levels high)\n- Comfortable handles to allow carrying of individual crates filled with heavy\ncontents (books, CDs)\n- Stackable for transportation and storage\n\nNice to Have\n- Protects as much as possible contents from dirt and dust\n- Allows disassembling of individual crates for easy shipping and storage of empty\ncrates\n- Allows moderate flexibility in shelf sizes and spacing to provide efficient stirage\nfor books, CDs, DVDs,...\n- Different colors to allow matching to existing furniture or wallpaper\n\nThe market for such a universal crate is huge, since every household in the US has\ntypically several shelves. There are about 150 million households in the US. The core\nmarket segment is people who move frequently, for example students or singles. Also\nstartup companies that frequently have to move to larger and larger offices might be a\nparticularly profitable customer segment.\n\nSimple wooden crates (apple crates) cost $15-$20. Crates made out of plastic can be had\nfrom $3-$15. As I mentioned above, all these crates suffer severe design flaws. A better\ncrate could command a price of $30-$50.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu\n15.783J / 2.739J Product Design and Development\nSpring 2006\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: https://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

The team members turned to various possible\nmarket segments to gather information - both current Cadillac owners and potential target market members (such\nas families with children, business users, etc.).\n-\nThe group is rather satisfied with the list of needs compiled. It addresses a wide range of needs that our target\nmarket would ideally answer with our product. Some of the needs already suggest the trade-offs we will have to\ndeal with in deciding on our product specifications.

Dealership observations listed in Appendix\n\nProcess Comments\nGroup Meeting - 2/24/2004\n-\nDiscussed general concept categories - various attachment points for the tray, deployment technologies, tray dimensions,\netc.\n-\nReviewed list of needs from interviews, and members stressed the needs they believed to be critical - those that should be\naddressed in the sketches.\n-\nIdentified the \"sketch-capable\" team members - others would forward their ideas/initial sketches to them for representation.\nGroup meeting - 2/26/2004\n-\nTo begin the session all identified needs where placed on board using post-it notes. The entire group then began grouping\nneeds into eight categories using consensus. After about 30 minutes the group had agreed upon the categories of needs.\nThe group then came up with a central need each group addressed.\n-\nIn preparation for concept-sketching, the team discussed the needs in more depth. Important needs were pointed out, to\nmake sure team members keep them in mind while generating concepts.\n-\nIt was decided to survey the importance of the needs. Each team member would collect feedback from respondents that\npreviously stated their needs in order to assess their importance (sample survey in Appendix).\nGM Conference Call - 2/26/2004\n-\nDiscussed Unigraphics training, math data transfer and usage, confidentiality agreements, SRX Market Data and general\ninformation, Escalade market data, deliverable forwarding to GM, seating buck, and questions and general discussion\nDealership Tour - 3/1/2004\n-\nSeveral team members visited a local Cadillac dealership to look at the vehicle first-hand. They took digital photos, took\ndimensions, and discussed the project with the sales associates. Much insight was gathered this way regarding the market\nfor the Escalade and SRX and the willingness of customers to purchase various features. The team members wrote emails\nwith their impressions to the rest of the GM1 and GM2 teams (observations in Appendix).\n-\nWith this information, we hope to further tailor our concept generation to the constraints of the vehicles and market.\nProcess Reflection:\n-\nWe discussed possible attachment points / deployment options in the initial meeting, before we began with concept\ngeneration. While this might have restricted our solution space, we believed a team debate was worthwhile for identifying\nbenefits and limitations of solution directions. Saving time and converging on viable solutions motivated us to do so.\n-\nSelecting our 3 critical customer needs for this deliverable proved to be quite an involved task. In identifying and grouping\nprimary and secondary needs, the process of putting all of the customer needs on post-it notes was especially useful in\nreaching consensus.\n-\nAlso, as the project becomes more involved and complex, we have found it not only useful to \"divide and conquer\" but also\nto overlap resources so that team members are leading some tasks and supporting several others.\n\nAppendix\n- Sample needs ranking team survey\n- Cadillac dealership observations\n\nSample needs ranking team survey\nTHE LOWER THE NUMBER, THE MORE IMPORTANT THE NEED\nFill in only boxed areas and/or replace question marks\nRank in Category\n1.

Therefore, our concept selection matrix only displays \"high level\" designs.\nFurther customer research will determine which features are included.\n-\nThe concept selection matrix addresses how well the design answers each of the customer needs. However, in our case,\nthe choice of design is highly constrained by the car interior. Although some dimensions are known, we will have to\npotentially reevaluate concept design when detailed dimensional data is available.\nGroup Meeting - 3/2/2004\n-\nWe discussed the next deliverables and distributed responsibilities among team members.\n-\nWe decided to follow the book's method regarding the concept selection matrix, even though we had some reservations\nregarding it. (see process reflection above)\n-\nEach design was presented by its creator, and reviewed in higher detail by the team. Similar designs were consolidated,\nresulting in the categories at the top of the concept selection matrix.\n-\nIt was decided that the concept selection matrix will separately score each design by how it answers the needs of different\npopulations - the first being families with children, the second being business users.\nGroup Meeting - 3/4/2004\n-\nThe concept selection matrix was presented, and the weight of each need was discussed. As mentioned above, a different\nweight was assigned to the need importance for \"Family\" and \"Business\" users.\n-\nA preliminary Gantt-chart was presented to the team and reviewed.\n-\nTeam members brought forth other lingering concerns that they thought the team should address. In addition, every team\nmember was requested to think of the ensuing days.\nGM Conference Call and Email Correspondence - 3/4/2004\n-\nDiscussed GM Visit and Project Status Review\n-\nBoth GM teams will present to Gary Cowger on Monday March 29th from 1:00 - 1:30. Each team will have 15\nminutes to\ndo their presentation.\n-\nRequired Follow-up - Teams to forward the names of the presenters from each group once they are available\n-\nReceived faculty approval to sign GM confidentiality agreement\n-\nReviewed our market research findings that a higher weighting should be placed on the family purchaser with young children\n-\nGM is working to provide seats, additional market data, and dimensional data. In the interim, we are taking measurements at\nCadillac dealerships and conducting market research\n\nAppendix\n- Concept Selection Matrix Data\n\nFamily\nBusiness\nPrimary Need\nSelection Criteria\nWeight\nWeight\nRating\nNotes\nWtd 1\nWtd2\nRating\nNotes\nWtd 1\nWtd\nRating\nNotes\nWtd 1\nWtd\n1.

Richard Wagoner, Jr.\n\nProcess Comments\nProcess Reflection\n-\nThe major reasoning was the lack of knowledge of the team regarding the structure of the rear-seat passenger\nsurroundings. Since we didn't have access to detailed drawings of the seats and passenger areas, as well as the\nphysical seats, the design which allows the least interference with the existing structures was most appealing.\nWe were advised by the Cadillac dealers and Lear engineers that the rear-armrest would be easy to remove and\nreplace. Considering all these factors, the team decided to pursue the rear-armrest idea.\n-\nWe came up with 2 rather promising final concepts. One would be categorized as more technologically innovative\nand a more integral design. The other would be categorized as more technologically conservative - yet more\nrobust in its implementation. Ideally, we would have created mock-ups and even prototypes for both. This\nexperimentation would've helped us get a better \"feel\" for the potential product, and enabled us to collect user\nopinions. However, due to the time restrictions we are under, we decided to go with the \"safer\" design - that is -\nthe one we were more confident we could implement in practice.\nGroup Meeting - 3/8/2004\n-\nThe team reviewed the results of concept selection matrix, from which 2 general design ideas stood out. The first was the\nrear-armrest location and the second was the back of the front seats.\n-\nA decision was made to pursue the rear-armrest location (see process comments above).\nGroup Meeting - 3/11/2004\n-\nTeam members brought to the table more concept ideas they had generated for the rear-armrest. These were discussed,\nand it was decided that an additional meeting was needed to finalize a concept decision. For this meeting some promising\ndesigns would be drawn and described in higher detail.\nGroup Meeting - 3/13/2004 - Final Concept Generation\n-\nTwo final concepts were analyzed in greater detail, and the merits of each were discussed at length. The team converged\nand agreed on a single final concept. Drawings and descriptions were to be generated.\nAdvisor Meeting - 3/16/2004\n-\nOn March 15th Amber and Lane met with Professor Whitney to discuss the status of our current concept. He was impressed\nwith the engineering nature of or design, but was curious on how we plan to make it ascetically pleasing. He also had some\nconcern on the safety aspect of keeping tray tables in front seat map pocket. These concerns were passed on to members\nof the team.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu\n15.783J / 2.739J Product Design and Development\nSpring 2006\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: https://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

Our main concern is for the flexure\nof the system during usage.\nThe rods and table are each unlikely to show much bending, as\nshown by the calculations below:\nThe deflections derived are quite insignificant for our product.\nInstead, we believe that the real danger for the table \"giving\"\nunder loading are the interfaces between the components. We\npaid special attention to these in our detailed design, and\nintend to build the prototype in a way that will prove this\nphysically.\nAssuming a 50 Newton force (~5kg weight) spread along a line\nparallel to the sides of the table, 25cm from attachment point\nComments / Formulas / Sources\nLoad\n50 Newtons\n(at center of mass of table)\nTable\nLength\n0.5 Meters\n(runs L-R for passenger)\nW idth\n0.2 Meters\nThickness\n0.0125 Meters\nRod\nRadius\n0.005 Meters\nLength\n0.2 Meters\nMax table flex (assuming only table flexes)\nBeam bending (simply supported, loaded in the middle)\nMoment of inertia\n3.2552E-08 kg*m^2\n=W idth*Thickness^3/12\nW ood Young's Modulus\n1.5E+10 Pa\nwww.physics.usyd.edu.au/teach_res/db/d0004c.htm\nY (max deflection)\n-0.000267 Meters\nwww.polymorf.net/engineer19.htm\nfor bar loaded in center\n-0.0267 Cm\n= - F*L^3/(48*E*I)\nMax rod flex (assuming only rod flexes)\nRod bending (simply supported, loaded at the end)\nMoment of inertia\n4.9087E-10 kg*m^2\n=pi*r^4/4\nwww.efunda.com/math/areas/Circle.cfm\nSteel Young's Modulus\n2E+11 Pa\nY max deflection\n-0.0001698 Meters\nwww.polymorf.net/engineer19.htm\n-0.0170 Cm\n= - F*L^3/(48*E*I)\n\nPart\nNumber\nPart Name\nQuantity\nImage\nPrototype Material\nPrototype\nManufacture\nPivot Bar\nAlumimun Round Stock\nMill\nRatchet Post\nSteel\nRatchet\nABS\nMill\nRoll Pin\nSteel\nPurchased\nCompression Spring\nSteel\nPurchased\nUpper Bracket\nAlumimun Billet\nMill\nRelease Handle\nRen\nMachined\nPivot Bracket\nSteel\nPurchased\nArm Bottom\nArm\nPurchased\nArm Top\nArm\nPurchased\nExecutive Tray\nWood\nActivity Tray\nWood\nBill of Materials (BOM)\n\nPrototype Work\nSummary of important decisions\nSince assignment 5, we have made a few key decisions. We thoroughly investigated developing\na tray table system that stows entirely within the armrest - the team performed a feasibility\nanalysis, and worked to mock up possible solutions. We decided however to continue with the\nexisting design due to continued customer interviews and the constraints of the integral design.\nThe Bill of Materials (BOM) includes the required manufacturing processes. We have purchased\na standard Cadillac SRX armrest, and plan to manufacture most of the rest of the pieces, as\nnoted in the BOM.\nWeb resources:\nMcMaster offers a wide range of products and supplies:\nhttp://www.mcmaster.com\nWe purchased an arm rest from a Cadillac dealer found on the Cadillac corporate web site. The\npurchase was necessary because we have yet to receive parts directly from GM.\nhttp://www.cadillac.com/\n\nProduction Sketch\n\nProduction Sketch\nProduction Version Changes Include\n- Material Choices\n- upper bracket inj mold glass filled\n- handle inj mold w/burl\n- Finished Detail of Arm\n- Second Tray Option\n- Cup Holders Added\n\nApril\nMay\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 91011121314151617181920212223242526272829301 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9101112\nPage 1 of 1\n4/12/04\nGM Lap Tray - Team #2\nTASK\nDetailed Design\nAssembly Drawings Complete\nRedesign\nStress Calcualtion Complete\nMaterials and Component\nBill of Materials Complete\nVendor Selection\nProcurement of Materials and\nPrototype & Testing\nAlpha prototype build\nFunctional Testing\nConstruct Financial Model\nFinal Presentation\nPreparation\nDry-Run\nFinal Pitch\n4/1\n4/23\n4/13\n4/8\n4/23\n4/13\n4/13\n4/1\n4/21\n4/13\n4/3\n4/6\n4/21\n4/1\n5/5\n4/13\n4/29\n4/29\n5/5\n4/13\n4/27\n4/29\n5/9\n4/29\n5/6\n5/6\n5/8\nUpdated Schedule\n\nProcess Reflection\n-\nThe major difficulty in this period was to decide whether to stay with the original concept idea of detachable table after receiving critique during\nboth the GM presentation and advisor meetings. To assist the decision making, the team conducted yet another customer survey focusing on\ntarget customer market of \"soccer mums\". The results showed, that nobody in our target market would not buy the table because it is detachable.\nThe table would mainly be used during longer trips, in which case slightly more complicated \"assembly\" was not seen as a problem. Customers\nnoted that a detachable table would be easy to clean and replace if broken. Customers also mentioned that the concept would enable different\ntray tops for different purposes. The main disadvantage was the fear of loosing the table.\n-\nWhile the team realizes the many challenges, it was unanimously decided to stay with the selected concept. The reasons were:\n-\nlack of time and resources to come up with an attached mechanism within the armrest that would meet the \"must have\" customer needs,\nsuch as aesthetically pleasing, durable, and useful for children\n-\nImportance of providing GM an alternative concept different from that of the other team's\n-\nencouraging feedback from target customer market\n-\nthe ability to accommodate big enough tray table, as indicated by the customer surveys\n-\nFor the product to be accepted by target market, it needs to have the feel of German quality, low enough price and good functionality (large\nenough table to fit a coloring book). The team also faces the challenge how to convince the audience during final presentations. The major risk for\nthe selected concept is therefore uncertainty in customer survey information accuracy.\n-\nAnother issue, which is typical of the product development process, was lack of perfect information. To address this, the team purchased an\narmrest from a Cadillac dealer.\nGroup Meetings 3/30, 4/1/2004\n-\nTeam was not in full strength due to holidays and illnesses. However, feedback from the GM presentation was seriously discussed, and viability of\nour concept questioned. It was decided to conduct a customer survey with concept pictures, to compare the feedback from GM with input from the\ntarget market.\n-\nIndividual tasks for the next lengthy assignment were divided.\nGroup Meeting - 4/6/2004\n-\nPaul reviewed customer survey and interview feedback. After lengthy discussion of pros and cons the team members decided to stay with the\nexisting concept.\n-\nThe materials for final prototype were discussed; team decided to make a prototype that would provide the \"wow\" factor from an aesthetics\nstandpoint, but also provide enough functionality to demonstrate the concept. The team had not yet identified a machine shop to do the final\nprototype.\nGroup Meeting - 8/4/2004\n-\nTomer managed to secure us the opportunity to use graduate students' mechanical workshop.\n-\nThe schedule for assignment was checked and the team reviewed the status of the CAD drawings.\n-\nSeats were still not available, but the team remained hopeful to receive a sample arm rest to use in building the final prototype.\nAdvisor Meeting - 8/4/2004\n-\nThe team met with Roemer, Kressy and Whitney to discuss the status of the project. Roemer and Kressy questioned the feasibility of the\ndetachable concept, but understood our reasoning to go forward with it. However, they highlighted the importance of convincing our audience\nduring the final presentation. Whitney gave good ideas for how to mechanically lock-in the table top.\nProcess Notes\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu\n15.783J / 2.739J Product Design and Development\nSpring 2006\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: https://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

phase. We used our\nmeetings during the week to review the progress of the build team, and address questions and problems.\nPrototype Production Status:\n- Purchased armrest from dealer, decomposed it, and evaluated what can be used for the prototype and what will\nbe made at the shop or outsourced.\n- The frame and leatherette covering will be used for the final prototype.\n- Several components have already been outsourced to outside manufacturers.\n- We also reviewed the financial model as a group, commenting on critical factors to the projected financial\nperformance (discount rate, supplier, dealer and GM margins, etc.).\nFinancial Model:\n- The last three weeks were also used to develop our financial model and conduct sensitivity analysis\nConference Call with GM representatives\n- We found the responses of the representatives at the GM conference call (with the Cadillac Accessories Manager\nand one Cadillac Program Manger) very supportive of our efforts and design. They also:\n- Liked the possibility of very quick installation (way below the 45 min. limit)\n- Liked the fact that changes to other interior components was minimal.\n- Confirmed that the deliverables we are producing (these reports, the customer data, the concept drawings\nand prototype) are in-line with their expectations.\n- Confirmed that our retail price goals were reasonable for the accessories market and our product in\nparticular ($400 for both tray tables)\n- Additionally, the GM executives did not see the detachability as an immediate concern, as long as it is well made,\neasy to use, and easily storable (will fit well in rear map pocket or behind the back seats).\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu\n15.783J / 2.739J Product Design and Development\nSpring 2006\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: https://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

Being ranked among the top 10 cyclists in the United States, he\nputs great emphasis on staying healthy and having the right gear. Especially during\nracing season, he cannot afford the hassles of contaminated water and therefore\nalways carries his water filter with him. However, since his hikes are mainly day\nhikes, overall usage of the water filter is limited.\n-\nAs a successful designer of new products, who runs his own company and who\nteaches at two of the most prestigious institutions in the country, he is very\ndemanding on the products he purchases and is often an opinion leader heard on the\ninternet and among his friends, acquaintances and business contacts.\n-\nEnjoying a great deal of financial freedom, he only purchases products that truly\nimpress him and whose functionality is at their core. He favors air cooled Porsches\nand original Land Rovers over designs from Versace or Graves.\n-\nIn summary, Matt K. can be considered a typical \"high end\" customer for water filters\nwith great influence among his peers.\n-\nSo what is going on in his brain?\n\nEvaluating Products\n- Products are Bundles of Attributes\n- Buyers assign Values to the Realization of\nthese Attributes\n- Buyers combine Attribute Values to\nGenerate Product Values\n\nWater Filter Example\n- 4 Attributes\n- 3 Levels Each\n- Each Level has a (Part Worth) Utility\nPump Rate\nUtility\nWeight\nUtility\n0.8

USE NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENTS !!\n-\n(Then it's not a public disclosure.)\n\nApril 4th , 2006\nStephen Brown, MIT TLO\nCriteria for practicing a patent\n- The patent owner can prevent others from\n\"making, using, selling, or importing\"\n- No dominating patents\n- Another patent dominates yours if you practice at least\none claim of theirs\n- OK if you have permission to infringe from the\nowner of the dominating patent, i.e., a license\n- NB: You may need this anyway\n\nApril 4th , 2006\nStephen Brown, MIT TLO\nDeciding to file\n- Is it Incremental, Disruptive, or Platform Technology?\n- Number of potential markets and their sizes?\n- What resources are needed to commercialize?\n- Who would fund, license, or partner?\n- Can claims be written to capture the value created?\n- Will prior art limit potential claims available?\n- Can claims be written to prevent \"design around\" patents?\n- Can you identify potential infringers easily?\n- How is value created counted?...by whom?\n- How dependence is it on other technology, legislation,\nresearch\n\nApril 4th , 2006\nStephen Brown, MIT TLO\nTypes of patents\n- Provisional\n- Utility\n- Machine\n- Process\n-
