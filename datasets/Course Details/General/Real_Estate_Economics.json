Solve\nfor the new values. You should describe how and why rents, asset prices, construction, and\nthe stock of space change in each scenario. (Note that each of the scenarios builds upon the\nprevious ones - i.e. in C, assume that A and B have already occurred).\n\nA Global capital starts to flow into real estate. As a consequence cap rates are driven down from\n.10 all the way to .05. What happens to prices and rents in the short run - if the stock and\nconstruction do not change. That is, calculate new values for {P, R} given old values for S,C.\n\nB In the long run construction and the stock adjust. What happens to the price of real estate and\nspace per worker in the long-run (i.e. after the stock has fully adjusted).\n\nC. A credit crisis now ensues. Cap rates rise back to 10% and office employment (heretofore\nfixed) now contracts by 10% from 10m to 9m. What happens now in the short run - where the\nstock is fixed at the level in B? What happens in the long run if the credit constraints continue\nwith construction and the stock now adjusting?"

A developer, Mr. F, in the town of Hamilton outside of Boston is\ndebating with the county zoning committee. He recently bought a 10 acre land parcel, and plans\nto develop single-family housing. Currently this land is zoned at 1 unit per acre. Mr. F feels that\nhigher density is more profitable, but the zoning committee believes that the \"market\" is very\nstrong for the density of 1 unit per acre. To resolve this debate, Mr. F hires you as a consultant to\nwrite a report to the zoning committee (not to exceed 5-pages, double spaced, excluding\nregression output or other attachments) to provide a professional opinion regarding the optimal\n\"market\" density for residential development in the town. The report should include an\nintroduction, a description of your methodology, including both your theoretical model or\nassumptions and your statistical results, an analysis or interpretation of these results, and\nconclusions or recommendations.\n\n(Please note that this assignment and the data you have been given, are, like the real world,\nmessy. There are outliers, and you can certainly obtain counter intuitive results if you try.\nHowever, in general, the data are consistent with what you might expect, i.e. there are no \"tricks\"\nin this assignment. Nonetheless, you may find it helpful to make assumptions regarding the data,\nthe market, the time period, or the technological constraints involved in development. If you do,\nplease state all of your assumptions up front and be realistic, all assumptions are not equal.)\n\nIn order to approach this problem using statistical analysis, you collected recent lot transaction\ndata in Hamilton (data attached). You recorded 40 transactions in 1992-97, with the YEAR and\nMONTH when the transaction occurred (month 11 means November, etc.), SQFT as the area of\nthe lot (in 1,000 sqft), and SALE$ as the amount of money the lot was sold (in $1,000). For\nexample, the data shows that in November 1996, a lot with 72,000 sf was sold at $220,000. Note\nthat each lot represents the land for one single-family house.\n\nStep 1: Using these data, you try to estimate the relationship between Sale$ per lot and density.\nYou need to convert the lot size into a density variable (DENSITY) that measures lots per acre.\nPay attention to the measurement units in the conversion. You might also think that lot prices\ngenerally, though not necessarily, appreciate over time. Therefore you should create a discrete\ntime variable TIME that measures the months from the beginning of the data period to capture the\nappreciation effect over time. Specify a simple linear relationship (model) between price and\ndensity (and time) and estimate that model. What are your regression results, and how should you\ninterpret the parameters and R2?\n\nStep 2: Using your model, and assuming developers maximize profit, derive a formula for the\noptimal density as a function of time. Derive the optimal density that Mr. F would use in 1992.6?\nIn 1997.6? In 1998.6?\n\n11.433/15.021\nProject #2\nPage 2\n\nStep 3: With your optimal density formula, you can calculate the value of Mr. F's 10 acres if he\nhas to follow the zoning proposed by the town, 1 lot per acre. What is the difference between this\nvalue and what his land is worth if he develops it at your suggested density? What is the loss if\nMr F uses the Board's 1 acre rule in 1998.6? What limitations might there be in the applicability\nof your analysis. Can you make any statements as to the possible sources, directions, or\nmagnitudes of bias in your estimates?\n\nStep 4: To confirm your results, consider another approach to estimating price appreciation. If the\nmarket does not move smoothly over time, an alternative model may be estimated using dummy\nvariables for the years 1993 (D93), 1994 (D94), 1995 (D95), 1996(D96), and 1997 (D97) (not for\n1992!). For example, D93 = 1 if year equals 1993, but zero otherwise. Construct these variables\nand run the regression. What are the regression results, and how do you interpret the parameters\nand R2? Repeat Steps 1,2 and 3 using your new parameters - estimating what the dummy value\nfor 1998 is. Compare results. Are they the same? Why/why not? Which model provides a better\nestimate of optimal density?\n\nData\n\n(Note: 1 acre = 43,560 sf)\n\nYear Month Sqft (1000s) Sale Price ($1000s)\nYear\nMonth Sqft (1000s) Sale Price ($1000s)"

This assignment draws on the model described in pages 143-146 of DiPasquale and\nWheaton, and developed in lecture. The point of this assignment is to use a simulation\nmodel, based on actual data plus assumptions, to determine the effects on patronage at\nshopping centers in the Boston metro area of changing either (1) shopping center\ncharacteristics or (2) the costs and patterns of travel costs.\n\nII. In the assignments section, you will find a folder of files entitled \"shares.zip,\" which you\nwill need to download to a PC (not a Mac) and then unzip into a separate directory. How\ndo you unzip files? Use WinZip, which should be decently self-explanatory. Once the\nfolder is unzipped, delete the file \"report1.dat\" if it exists. Report1.dat is the default\nname for output files, and the program doesn't work if there is already such a file\ndetected. The way around this is that every time you are done executing the program,\nrename report1.dat as something else, like \"report2.dat\".\n\nIII. In the directory there are a bunch of input data files and a file labeled shares.exe. This\nis the program. How do you run an .exe file?\nStep 1: You have to run it in the DOS environment. In window start menu click \"RUN\"\nand type in \"cmd\". A DOS Window will pop up.\nStep 2: Change the directory to where you unzipped your files.\nE.g. \"CD H:\\WinData\\My Documents\\ps31\" if that's where you put your files.\nStep 3: Then type \"shares\".\nWhen you open the file, you will be confronted with a menu of choices. The only choices\nthat are relevant here are execute the model, observe and save results. To do each of these\nyou type the number of the choice and then hit enter. Hitting enter by itself moves you\nback up the decision tree.\n\nIV. By carefully toggling under the first option \"modify input data\" you can actually\ninspect the center characteristics, utility coefficients, etc. - and in theory change them.\nThe current version of the program however does not allow you to change all of the\nutility coefficients - hence below we instruct you to do this directly by altering the input\nfile, parm.ssi.\n\n[This program was written in Fortran in the early 1980s when mainframes were widely\nused. It involves much computation and cannot be easily adapted to a window's friendly\nenvironment. Anyone who wants to reprogram it in C++ is welcome to the source code -\nit will take a few weeks! ]\n\nAssignment. The last few years have seen gas prices skyrocket. The media reports that\npeople are not shopping as much and when they do - they do it closer to home. As a\nconsultant for a major retail investor you have been charged with assessing the impact of\n\nrising gasoline prices on the retail patronage at Boston's regional malls. The assumption\nis that people will not stop coming to malls (and for example use neighborhood and\ncommunity centers more), but rather re-align which malls they patronize.\n\nIn this model there is no \"gasoline\" variable. There is only the disutility that each group\nof consumers experiences for travel, and then the distances between consumers and each\nof the retail malls. What you will change is the disutility parameters for all consumer\ngroups - to reflect the higher costs of travel. You should undertake two experiments in\naddition to the base or \"no change\" case.\n\nThe first experiment you should do is change the disutility coefficient for everyone from\n-.37500 to -.67500. This is done by altering the file parm.ssi with a text editor (be sure\nand copy the digits above exactly and be careful not to alter any other elements of the\nfile. The coefficient is about midway down in the file. This change increases everyone's\ndisutility for travel, but maintains the tendency of wealthier household to \"not mind travel\nas much\".\n\nThe second experiment adds to this change by also altering the .0081647 coefficient (just\nbelow to -.008164. Again be sure the use exactly these digits (Fortran is a very finicky\n\"high level\" programming language). What this does is reverse the relationship between\nhousehold income and travel disutility by making higher income households mind travel\n\"more\" (their cars presumably get worse mpg!)\n\nTo do all of this you will need to run the program 3 times (note that restarting the\nprogram clears your changes). Each time:\n(a). Erase the file report1.dat (or rename it)\n(b). Make the changes to parm.ssi\n(c). Execute the program, run the model, save the results.\n(d). Go back and rename the output file from report1.dat to whatever.\n\nWrite up your conclusions about what explains the results and why they come out the\nway they do. This is as important to your grade as getting the simulated outcomes\ncorrectly."

On each of 250 annual work days, 1.2 million commuters\nmade 2 (one way) trips - each trip averaging 15 miles. The operating costs of\nthese trips was 20 cents per mile on average, and the average value of time\nwas then about $10 per hour. The time per mile (hours) that it took each\ndriver to traverse the full 15 miles obeyed the following time/volume\nrelationship:\ntime = .05 (volume/1,200,000)2\nwhere: volume is the total number of (1way) commuter trips.\na). What was the total value of time and money cost then spent on\ntravel in the metro area assuming that every driver was \"average\"?\nA public rapid transit system was then proposed which would provide an\nalternative way of satisfying the commuting pattern of the area. It would\nhave a capital cost of 5 billion dollars, and variable operating costs of\n$1.25 per trip (for the average 15 mile). It was proposed that the fares of\nthe system would be set at these operating costs. The system would provide\nits riders with a speed of 20 mph over the same 15mile average commute.\nb). How many riders would use the system if drivers chose that mode\nwith the cheapest combined time and money costs?\nc). What would the total value of time and money costs spent traveling\non both modes be now?\nd). At what discount rate would it pay to build the system, assuming\nthat it lasts forever without any depreciation or maintenance {use the\ninverse perpetuity rule}.\ne). Write out the full expression for total travel costs as a function\nof how many travelers use the transit system. Either mathematically or by\nusing trial and error numerical simulation, determine what is the level of\nridership that minimizes total travel costs for the Washington D.C. area.\nf). If this number could be forced to use the system at what discount\nrate would it pay to build the system?\ng). As a planner - how could you get the \"right\" number of people to\nuse the system.

Wheaton\nDecember 2-11, 2008\nDue December 11, 2008\nThe Problem and the Data\nSuppose that you wish to forecast future rental housing conditions in Atlanta for a client.\nSuppose further that you are given the following quarterly data for the period 1985:1 to 2008:3\n(The data can be found in assignments section: ATLANT_08Q3.xls).\n3⁄4 EMP: Total employment in the Atlanta MSA (in thousands);\n3⁄4 POP: Population (in thousands);\n3⁄4 INC: Nominal aggregate personal income ;\n3⁄4 STOCK: Total stock of multifamily units in 5+ structures\n3⁄4 PRMT: Total number of (5+) multi-family housing units permitted;\n3⁄4 RENT: An index of average apartment rent in Atlanta from MPF Inc. (nominal, not real)\ndollars);\n3⁄4 VAC: The MSA vacancy rate (available only starting 1993.4)\n3⁄4 CPI: Consumer price index;\nYou should also construct several variables in real dollars (inflation adjusted) - namely RENT\n(call it RRENT), INC (call it RINC) and real income per worker WAGE = RINC / EMP.\nIn the data file you will find that there is a forecast through 2018:4 of the Atlanta economy in\nterms of the variables: INC, EMP, POP (as well as the national CPI). These incorporate a\nrecession over 2009 as well as a recovery and are the result of a US Macro Economic Model\nproduced by Economy.com (now a subsidiary of Moody's).\nPart 1: Univariate (demand only based) forecasts\nYou have to make a univariate forecast of real dollar (inflation adjusted) rents using lagged\nvalues of rent and some economic variables reflecting demand (ex ante). This equation should\nlook like the following.\nRRENTt = α + β0WAGEt + β1EMPt + β2 RRENTt-1 + β3 RRENTt-2 ...\n(a). Note that your equation should not start until 1986:4 if (for example) you were to use 4 lags\non RRENT - so as to avoid the zero value of rents in the first few periods. How many lags to\ninclude? Should they be adjacent periods or every 4th?\n\n(b). Now with this model(s) forecast rents forward for 10 years (40 quarters). Note that this\nforecast is conditional on the economic outlook provided by Economy.com. What do these\nforecasts look like? Do rents stabilize? Grow/fall infinitely?\nPart 2: Rent/Permit Bivariate structural Model.\nStart by Estimating the following system of three \"structural\" equations:\nRRENTt = a + b * RRENTt-1 + c*EMPt + d*STOCKt-1 + e*WAGEt\n(1)\nPERMITt = a + b * RRENTt-n + c* PERMITt-4\n(2)\nSTOCKt = STOCKt-1 + PERMITt-4\n(3)\nThe last of these equations of course is simply an identity and not a statistical model. WAGE is\nagain the real value of personal income/employment. In this model the 4-period lag on permits in\nequation (2) accounts for the seasonality of the latter. Permits in each quarter are best related to\nthe same quarter a year ago. Rent, however does not seem to have any seasonality.\n(a): From the first equation, how many units per additional thousand workers does it take to keep\nRRENT constant? Does this seem reasonable given the definition of the stock? What is the sign\non the wage variable? Why?\n(b). Now with this model system of equations forecast rents, permits and stock forward for 10\nyears (40 quarters). Note that this forecast is again conditional on the economic outlook provided\nby Economy.com. What do these forecasts look like in comparison to the previous model?\nPart 3: Back testing.\nHere, you will re-estimate the models above using only the data from 1985:1 through 2003:3.\nThen you will generate a 5-year forecast with each model for the period 2003:3 through 2008:3.\nIn each case you use the actual values of EMP and WAGE over the forecast period. This is a test\nof which model best captures how the economy drives the Atlanta Apartment market.\na). How close does each come to forecasting actual 2008:3 real rent levels?\nPart 4: Alternative Scenarios with different economic outlooks.\nHere, you will ascertain a \"worst-worst\" case for your client - based on a dismal outlook for\nAtlanta's economy in reaction to the US financial crisis.\n1). Generate a new forecast for Atlanta that assumes the current forecasts for INC and EMP (and\nWAGE) hold for the next 12 months (through 2009.3). Thereafter assume that the EMP grows at\nonly 1% annually and WAGE also grows at the rate of 1% annually (from dismal productivity).\n2). With this bleak economic outlook generate forecasts using the second (Bivariate) model -\nhow does this compare with the forecast using the Economy.com outlook?"

Switching over to the rental apartment market, what would happen\nover time to apartment rents, new construction and the stock of rental units.\n\n[Use graphs and not equations to illustrate the impacts]\n\n4). (30 points) As an industrial REIT you operate in two markets. To\nbetter understand the movement of rents in each of your markets, you gather\nsome data and statistically estimate the following relationship between\nvacancy and rents. Each market currently has 8% vacancy (V=8.0) and $6 rents.\n\nMarket A: Rt = 1.2 - .05 Vt-1 + .9 Rt-1\n\nMarket B: Rt = 2.0 - .10 Vt-1 + .8 Rt-1\n\nWhat will happen to rents in each market over the next few years if\nthere is no change in the vacancy rate? Suspecting that new development will\nraise vacancy in each market by 4% (to V=12.0) next year what will happen in\neach market to rents? If the increase in vacancy remains \"permanently\", where\nwill rents decrease the most after \"many years have elapsed\". Explain the\ndifferences.\n\nSubstitute for question for #2) on the make-up.\n\n2). (20 points) As a portfolio manager, you notice that the volatility\n(standard deviation) of your retail shopping centers' income has been less\nthan in previous decades. You also notice that the appraised values of the\ncenters are exhibiting recent volatility similar to past decades. Questioning\nyour accountant/appraiser, he says this is because the market is becoming more\nefficient in pricing. Do you agree? If so why?"

(40 points) You have purchased the land and lifts of an older ski\nresort. You are upgrading the lifts and are master planning the real estate\ndevelopment of the ski resort. After studying other resorts you come up with\nthe following (back of the envelope) regression for the sales price per square\nfoot of residential real estate in similar resorts:\n\nP = 300 - 100d - 20F\n\nWhere d is distance in miles to the lifts and F is FAR.\n\nYou ascertain that construction costs will be 140 per square foot\nregardless of FAR.\n\na). What does your \"optimal\" density or FAR gradient look like?\n\nb). How far should you extend development?\n\nc). What is land worth along this gradient?\n\n2). (20 points) It now seems likely that in the future travel costs are\nlikely to undergo long term increases - rather than the decreases of the last\ncentury. Oil prices and limited ability to expand highway capacity will all\ngenerate rising travel costs. What will be the impact on urban land use?\n\na). In a Monocentric model, what happens to land prices, employment, and\nresidential density as travel costs increase?\n\nb). In a polycentric model, what happens to land prices, employment, and\nresidential density as travel costs increase?\n\nCarefully explain you answer to each.\n\n3). (20 points) As retail developer you have acquired land next to an\nexisting shopping center and are seeking financing for a second Center. Your\nlender is very skeptical, but you argue that the existence of a center at a\nlocation does not mean that this site is a poor choice for developing an\n(additional) new center.\nUsing retail market concepts, carefully explain, generally, when\ndoubling the square footage of retail space at a particular location should\nlead to (more than/less than) a doubling of retail sales in the area?\nAs a lender what would you propose that the developer do in the way of\ngathering data to prove his case, configuring the center and insuring its\nsuccess?\n\n4). (20 points) The department of transportation is planning a major\nexpansion of capacity (adding 1-2 lanes each way) on a region's primary\ncircumferential highway. You are evaluating two investment opportunities.\na). At one intersection there has been lots of office development, the\ncongestion is horrible, and there is some land left for further development in\nresponse to the highway expansion.\nb). At another intersection, there exists a zoning cap on commercial\ndevelopment, and as a consequence current congestion is very modest.\nEvaluate these opportunities - in terms of how rents and hence prices\nare likely to react to the new highway expansion."

A $60000000 office park, that will require $7000000 in new capital outlays by the town\n(financed with 10% bonds that never mature - hint: the 1/r rule).\n\nWhat is the town's current tax rate? What would it be after each project? Which project will\nthe town likely select and why?\n\n2). Using a dynamic \"stock-flow\" model of commercial real estate analyze how both\nrents and prices each react to a positive demand shock, such as would occur if there was a\nsudden and unexpected increase in employment. Just Graph your answers - no need for\nequations. What happens to the ratio of prices/rents.\na). Your answers will depend on what you assume about price formation in the market.\nConduct the analysis separately for the case where prices are perfectly informed and forward\nlooking, as opposed to myopically backward looking.\n\n3). Over the last 30 years, the Atlanta MSA has increased in population and employment\nby almost 200%. During this same period, the real price of housing (inflation adjusted) has risen\nonly 15%. By contrast, the population and employment growth numbers for the Chicago MSA\nare 35% and the real house price inflation has been 85%. Using a 3-sector model of a region's\neconomic growth, what explains these results. Why are there these differences?\n\n4).You are comparing two MSA hotels markets with an eye towards an investment. From\nSTR and FW Dodge you obtain the following information.\n\nMarket A\n\nMarket B\nCurrent Rooms Available:\n5,000,000\n10,000,000\nRooms sold (2008)\n\n3,500,000\n\n8,000,000\nHotel rooms under construction\n(to be delivered in next 12 months): 1000\n\nProjected aggregate annual\nRegional GDP growth:\n\n2%\n4%\nAverage Daily Room Rate (ADR) 160 220\n\nYou know econometrically that the following relationship holds in the market place\nbetween the growth in room rates and occupancy:\n\nADRt = 10 + 100 OCt +.5ADRt-1\n\na). What is current occupancy in each market and how will it likely change over the next 12\nmonths and what assumptions is this based upon? [express Occupancy (OC) as a fraction, e.g. 0.70]\nb).

Consider a simple single employment center city. Where within this\ncity is the volatility in the price of residential land likely to be the\ngreatest, assuming that such volatility tends to arises from:\na). Expansions and contractions in what people expect the rate of growth\nof population to be for the city.\nb). Rises and falls in the price of oil and gasoline.\nExplain your answer with graphs or diagrams.\n2). In neighborhood and community retail centers, the anchor\nsupermarket typically pay $20 rent. Smaller stores, such as pharmacies,\ncleaners, video rentals pay typically $30 rent.\nIn regional centers, the anchors (mostly department stores) typically\npay $2 rents, while smaller stores pay on average rents in the $40 range.\na). Carefully explain why rents differences exist between stores within\ncenters.\nb). Why do you think the rent differential is so much greater in\nregional malls versus neighborhood/community centers.\n3). A newer city has grown rapidly over the years with a modern housing\nstock that has almost a constant FAR of .5 from its center to the edge at 20\nmiles. A regression equation has estimated the following relationship for the\nprice/sqft of housing floor area:\nP = 120 2t 2FAR\nwhere:\nP: price/sqft of floor area\nFAR: floor/land area ratio\nt: distance from the CBD\nIf construction costs are 80/sqft, what is a square foot of vacant land\npotentially worth at the center?\nSince there is no vacant land currently, would it be profitable to\nredevelop sites at the center? If so, how profitable is redevelopment?\nIs redevelopment profitable in some of the older suburbs where t=10?\n4). You are contemplating buying property in one of two areas of\nChicago: the downtown CBD and the region's major suburban node. You gather\nthe following information.\nCBD\nSuburb\nNet Rent\n$30\n$35\nDevelopment costs\n$45\n$30\nAverage commute time\n50min\n20min\nWorkers in each area use roughly 200 square feet for offices and\naverage Chicago wages are $100,000. Your partner argues that the CBD will\nhave significant rent rises ahead since it is below replacement costs and you\nshould buy there. Is she correct? Which area is likely to grow in terms of\njobs? Which will have the best rent increase? Carefully explain why?"

Extensions: travel distortions.\n- People drive too often and should double up\n- Trips are too long (land uses too spread out)\n- Transit and other less congestion-prone\nmodes are not used enough\n- Peak periods of travel need to be broadened: work\nhours need to be spread out.\n- When development creates traffic it needs to be\ntaxed/regulated (!) Not only for local infrastructure, but for\nregional Traffic impacts as well.\n- Impacts beyond local jurisdiction borders suggests\nbargaining between town-Developer is not enough."

Why?\n\nMIT Center for Real Estate\nMaintenance, Improvements, and\nexpansions as \"Supply\"\n- It is rational to let buildings eventually deteriorate.\nWith discounting, the net benefits of maintenance\ndecline over time.\n- Major improvements, expansions constitute a huge\nannual market (30% as large as new\ndevelopment).\n- Improvements are \"rational\" and are more likely\nto occur when housing is a \"good investment\" (i.e.\nlow P and high expected ΔP/P ).\n- The Elderly improve less = another way of\nconsuming your housing equity!
