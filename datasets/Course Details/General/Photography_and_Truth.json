We will discuss the uses and functions of pictures; how they are to be understood and interpreted; whether they have clear-cut content and meanings; how they shape and are shaped by politics, economics, and social life.\n\nTopics covered include photographs of the human face; spirit photography and deception; everyday vernacular photography (snapshots, postcards, scrapbooks, studios, itinerant photographers), both in our own society and elsewhere; imperial and colonial photography of non-western peoples; photography in anthropology; gender in advertising photography; political uses of photography in documentation and propaganda, particularly in the Great Depression of the 1930s.\n\nA good deal of time, both in class and in \"reading\" assignments, will be devoted to examining and interpreting photographs. We will also see a number of videos concerned with still photography.\n\nBooks, Articles, and Photographs\n\nThe following three books are available for purchase and on library reserve.\n\nEdwards, Steve.\nPhotography: A Very Short Introduction\n. New York, NY: Oxford University Press, 2006. ISBN: 9780192801647.\n\nWright, Richard.\n12 Million Black Voices\n. New York, NY: Basic Books, 2002. ISBN: 9781560254461.\n\nSontag, Susan.\nRegarding the Pain of Others\n. New York, NY: Picador, 2004. ISBN: 9780312422196.\n\nOther reading assignments can be found in the\nreadings\nsection.\n\nFor most weeks, \"reading\" assignments will include images to examine. Viewing assignments will be made week by week. For some, you may be directed to one or two other Web sites. See the\nphotos\npage for more information.\n\nAs supplementary sources for writing assignments (and just for browsing), the following three excellent volumes are on library reserve for this subject. All three are interesting, readable, and jargon-free. Most of the articles are brief and, in the Frizot and Marien volumes, profusely illustrated.\n\nLenman, Robin.\nThe Oxford Companion to the Photograph\n. New York, NY: Oxford University Press, 2005. ISBN: 9780198662716.\n\nFrizot, Michel.\nA New History of Photography\n. Koln, Germany: Konemann, 1998. ISBN: 9783829013284.\n\nMarien, Mary Warner.\nPhotography: A Cultural History\n. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Prentice Hall, 2006. ISBN: 9780132219068.\n\nThe MIT Library has a huge collection of books of photographs and books about photography.\n\nWriting and Class Assignments\n\nWhat matters most is staying up with reading and viewing assignments and participating actively in class. Several papers will be due during the semester, with details available on the\nassignments\npage.",

Include a photograph if relevant.\n\nChoose two from A and one from B or vice-versa:\n\nA. Some aspect of photography in \"real life\" that you read about or observe.\n\nIt can be a recent practice, such as having a photographer hide in the bushes\n\nto record a marriage proposal, or a recent event in which photography played\n\na part, or claims made about photography or a photograph, or the impact of an\n\nexhibit, or....\n\nB. Photography or a photograph as it appears in a novel, short story, play, or film.\n\nThe first week's reading in Edwards has several examples. Often a photograph\n\nwill play a key role in a detective story or a novel of another sort, talking about\n\nfacts, or hidden truths, or family relationships.\n\nFor both A and B, you are to consider questions (but not all of them at once) such as:\n\n-why effects does photography (or a photograph) have or are attributed to it?\n\n-how is photography understood or constituted?\n\n-what is photography connected with in life?\n\n-what does photography mean?\n\nIn any case, try to briefly make sense of the example, hopefully at least partly in terms of\nideas from the course. Choose examples because they are interesting and you can say\ninteresting things about them. (You can always try them out on me ahead of time.)\n\nDeadlines for the mini-essays are spaced out over the first three-quarters of the term.\n\n1. Week 4\n\n2. Week 7\n\n3. Week 9\n\nYou are encouraged, however, to write your examples up and turn them in as soon as you\nfind them. We will discuss some of the cases or examples in class."
