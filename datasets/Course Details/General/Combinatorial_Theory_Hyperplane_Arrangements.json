  "syllabus_content": "Course Meeting Times\n\nLectures: 3 sessions / week, 1 hour / session\n\nCourse Information\n\nAbout half the course will be based on notes from a previous lecture series. Some of the topics covered in the course involve connections with topology, representation theory, and commutative algebra. Those with insufficient backgrounds in these topics should still be able to follow most of the course.\n\nTextbook\n\nThere is no required text, although I have included an extensive\nbibliography\n.\n\nThe main text on hyperplane arrangements is: Orlik, P., and H. Terao.\nArrangements of Hyperplanes.\nNew York: Springer-Verlag, 1992.\n\nThis book has more emphasis on algebra and topology and less on combinatorics than will be presented in the course. There is no real reason to purchase this book for the course, but those who want to look deeper into the subject can do so.\n\nGrading\n\nGrading will be based on problem sets due approximately once every two weeks.",

SEPARATING HYPERPLANES (PRELIMINARY VERSION)\nExercises 6\n(1) Let A be a central arrangement in Rn with distance enumerator DA(t) (with\nrespect to some base region R0). Define a graph GA on the vertex set R(A)\nby putting an edge between R and R⊆ if #sep(R, R⊆) = 1 (i.e., R and R⊆ are\nseparated by a unique hyperplane).\n(a) [2-] Show that GA is a bipartite graph.\n(b) [2] Show that if #A is odd, then DA(-1) = 0.\n(c) [2] Show that if #A is even and r(A) 2 ( mod 4), then DA(-1) 2 (\nmod 4) (so DA(-1) ∈= 0).\n(d) [2] Give an example of (c), i.e., find A so that #A is even and r(A) 2 (\nmod 4).\n(e) [2] Show that (c) cannot hold if A is supersolvable. (It is not assumed that\nthe base region R0 is canonical. Try to avoid the use of Section 1.6.4.)\n(f) [2+] Show that if #A is even and r(A) 0 ( mod 4), then it is possible for\nDA(-1) = 0 and for DA(-1) ∈= 0. Can examples be found for rank(A) ∼3?\n(2) [2-] Show that a sequence (c1, . . . , cn) ≤ Nn is the inversion sequence of a per\nmutation w ≤Sn if and only if ci ∼i -1 for 1 ∼i ∼n.\n(3) [2] Show that all cars can park under the scenario following Definition 1.1 if\nand only if the sequence (a1, . . . , an) of preferred parking spaces is a parking\nfunction.\n(4) [5] Find a bijective proof of Theorem 1.2, i.e., find a bijection ' between the set\nof all rooted forests on [n] and the set PFn of all parking functions of length\nn satisfying inv(F) = n+1 -a1 -· · · -an when '(F) = (a1, . . . , an). Note.\nIn principle a bijection ' can be obtained by carefully analyzing the proof of\nTheorem 1.2. However, this bijection will be of a messy recursive nature. A\n\"nonrecursive\" bijection would be greatly preferred.\n(5) [5] There is a natural two-variable refinement of the distance enumerator (9)\nof Sn. Given R ≤ R(Sn), define d0(R0, R) to be the number of hyperplanes\nxi = xj separating R0 from R, and d1(R0, R) to be the number of hyperplanes\nxi = xj + 1 separating R0 from R. (Here R0 is given by (7) as usual.) Set\nq d0 (R0 ,R)td1 (R0 ,R)\nDn(q, t) =\n.\nR≤R(Sn )\nWhat can be said about the polynomial Dn(q, t)? Can its coefficients be inter\npreted in a simple way in terms of tree or forest inversions? Are there formulas\nor recurrences for Dn(q, t) generalizing Theorem 1.1, Corollary 1.1, or equation\ni\n(5)? The table below give the coefficients of q tj in Dn(q, t) for 2 ∼n ∼4.\nt\\q\nt\\q\n0 1\n1 1\nt\\q\n0 1 2 3\n\nR. STANLEY, HYPERPLANE ARRANGEMENTS\nSome entries of these table are easy to understand, e.g., the first and last\nentries in each row and column, but a simple way to compute the entire table is\nnot known.\n(6) [5-] Let Gn denote the generic braid arrangement\nxi - xj = aij , 1 ∼ i < j ∼ n,\nin Rn . Can anything interesting be said about the distance enumerator DGn (t)\n(which depends on the choice of base region R0 and possibly on the aij 's)? Gen\neralize if possible to generic graphical arrangments, especially for supersolvable\n(or chordal) graphs.\n(7) [3-] Let A be a real supersolvable arrangement and R0 a canonical region of A.\nShow that the weak order WA (with respect to R0) is a lattice.\n(8) (a) [2+] let A be a real central arrangement of rank d. Suppose that the weak\norder WA (with respect to some region R0 ≤ R(A)) is a lattice. Show that\nR0 is simplicial, i.e., bounded by exactly d hyperplanes.\n(b) [3-] Let A be a real central arrangement. Show that if every region R ≤\nR(A) is simplicial, then WA is a lattice."
