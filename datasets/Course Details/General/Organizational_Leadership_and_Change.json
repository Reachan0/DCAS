A boy's life\nhangs on the outcome. As the movie begins, all courtroom evidence has been presented and the jury is given its charge\nby the judge. While work groups in business differ from a jury, nevertheless many of the issues and problems raised in\nthe film are characteristic of all groups whatever their formal purpose.\n\nBelow is a seating chart which will aid in observing the film. The Jury Foreman is located at the front end of the table.\nHe is an assistant coach. To his left is the Bank Teller who can be recognized by his high pitched voice. Next is the\nMessenger Service Owner, who shows pictures of his boy. To his left is the Stockbroker, who wears glasses and is\nreading the stock report in the newspaper. The next man is the Man from the Slums. He is dressed in a suit. The\nperson at the end of the table is the Baseball Fan. He is wearing a straw hat and he makes wise cracks as the jury\ndeliberations get underway. At his left is Henry Fonda, who is an architect.\n\nTo Fonda's left is the Old Man. He is in the men's room when the foreman starts to call the meeting to order and is the\nlast man to sit at the table. Next is the Garage Owner who is bothered with a summer cold. Next is the Watchmaker\nwho has a small mustache.

LGO taught me that\nleadership is not that different from any other skill;\nyou have to practice to get better. This sounds so\nsimplistic, but the idea of actively trying to improve\nmy leadership skills instead of just hoping that they\nimproved on their own over time was actually a new\nidea to me.\n\nA Two Year Journey\nSummer\nFall\nIAP\nSpring\nReflection and\nMoving Forward\nCross Class\nExchange\nLeadership Webcasts and Coaching\nCross Class Exchange\nInternship\nTiger Teams\nSummer\nFall\nIAP\nSpring\nUniverse Within\nLeadership\nFoundations\nOrganizational\nProcesses\nCommunications\nLearning\nfrom SYs\nPlant Tour\nLeadership\nDebrief\nLGO Leadership\n& Ethics\nSeminar\nTiger Teams\nSloan Leadership\nElectives\nPersonal Leadership\nDevelopment Plan\nInternship Prep\nLGO Committees and Activities\nCore\nElective\nPractice Field\nFirst\nYear\nSecond\nYear\nLeadership Journals\nLGO Seminar - Leading\nfrom the Middle\nLGO ProSem - Leadership Speakers\nLGO Seminar - Leading\nfrom the Middle\n\nLeadership Committee\n- Coordination of LGO Leadership seminars\n- Ethics and Leadership with Don Davis & Bill Hanson\n- Leading from the Middle\n- Tiger Teams\n- Curriculum review & improvement recommendations\n- Leadership Reaction Course\n- Leading from the Middle\n- Leadership Lab\n- ROTC IAP seminar\n- Alumni mentoring program\n- Coordination with SDM and Sloan leadership activities\n\n15.317\n- Spans the entire two years\n- This Summer and Spring 2011 classroom sessions\n- Internship prep sessions\n- Webcasts and deliverables during the internship\n- Midstream and Knowledge Review reflection sessions\n- Receive one grade in Spring 2011\n- 1/3 Summer 2009 course (receive ―J‖ grade for summer units)\n- 40% participation\n- 40% individual paper\n- 20% team activities (peer feedback + team paper)\n- 1/3 Spring 2011 course\n- 1/3 Leadership Practice Fields\n- Internship + other activities\n\nLGO Leadership Challenge*\nAll students will challenge themselves\nto develop their leadership potential\nthrough experimenting and growing\noutside their comfort zone and leaving\na sustainable legacy.\n* Developed by the LFM07 Leadership Committee\n\nLeadership Reflections from Prior Classes\nI did not approach LGO as an opportunity to learn\nleadership. In fact I explicitly decided that I was not going\nto work on leadership while in the program. I was in the\ncamp of \"leadership can't be learned\", I assumed I had\nenough experience, and I didn't see a lot of relevance to\nmy learning objectives. This was a terrible perspective for\nme to take... The frameworks that I now have at my\ndisposal, the action skills I have developed, the reflection\nthat this time has afforded and the guidance through this\nprocess that the leadership curriculum has provided has\nmade me a better human. I will draw from this experience\nfor the rest of my life.\n\nLeadership Frameworks\n\nWangari Maathai\n- Born: 1940 in Nyeri, Kenya\n- Outside and inside formal education\n- B.S. Biology, Mount St. Scholastica College, Atchison, Kansas,\n- M.S. Biological Sciences, Univ. of Pittsburg, 1966\n- Doctoral studies in Germany\n- PhD Anatomy, Univ. of Nairobi, 1971\n- Chair, Department of Veterinary Anatomy, Univ. of Nairobi, 1976\n- Introduced idea of planting trees using ordinary people in\n- Launched Green Belt Movement (GBM) in 1977\n- Over 30 million trees planted across Kenya\n- Similar initiatives successfully launched in other countries\n- Nobel peace prize in 2004\n\nBackground\n- Kenya\n- Colonized and ruled by the British from late 19th\ncentury to early 1960's\n- Won independence in 1963\n- 30 million people\n- 2/3 of population live in abject poverty with high rates\nof malnutrition\n- Land is primarily semi-desert with forested area < 2%\n\nDistributed Leadership\nI'm very conscious of the fact that you\ncan't do it alone. It's teamwork. When\nyou do it alone you run the risk that when\nyou are no longer there nobody else will\ndo it.\n* Wangari Maathai, The Green Belt Movement: Sharing the Approach & the Experience,\nLantern Books, 2004, p. 136\n\nHistorical Perspective of Leadership\n- Personal Characteristics & Values\n- Individual Attributes/Traits\n- Not necessarily hard-wired; reflects lifetime\nexperiences & development\n- One's moral code\n- Situational Leadership\n- Critical situations provide an opportunity for\nleadership to be tested & displayed\n- Different situations call for different kinds of\nleadership\n\nTechnical vs. Adaptive Work\nSituation Problem\ndefinition\nSolution &\nimplementation\nPrimary locus of\nresponsibility for\nthe work\nKind of work\n\nType I\n\nClear\n\nClear\n\nLeader\n\nTechnical\nType II\nClear\nRequires\nlearning\nLeader\nand followers\nTechnical\nand adaptive\nType III\nRequires\nlearning\nRequires\nlearning\nLeader as\nfacilitator\nAdaptive\n\nAdapted from Ronald Heifetz, Leadership Without Easy Answers, 1994\n\nTransformational Leadership\n- Inspire followers toward vision and goals\n- Build trust between leaders and followers\n- Develop creative solutions to problems\n- Coach and mentor followers\nLeading change\n\nVisioning\nRelating\nInventing\nSense-\nmaking\nSloan 4 Capabilities Model\n\nVisioning\nRelating\nInventing\nSensemaking\nSloan Leadership Model\n> Seek many types & sources of data\n> Involve others in your sensemaking\n> Do not simply apply your existing frameworks &\noverlay them on the situation\n> Move beyond stereotypes\n> Learn from small experiments\n> Use images, metaphors, or stories to try to\ncapture & communicate critical elements of your\nmap\n> Understand the perspective of others within the\norganization & withhold judgment while listening\nto them\n> Encourage others to voice their opinions\n> Be clear about your stand and how you\nreached it\n> Think about how others might react to your\nidea & how you might best explain it to them\n> Think about your connections\n> Develop a vision about something that excites\nyou or that you think is important\n> Frame the vision with an ideological goal\n> Use stories, metaphors and analogies to paint\na vivid picture of what the vision will accomplish\n> Practice creating a vision in many arenas\n> Enable co-workers by pointing out that they\nhave the skills & capabilities needed to realize\nthe vision\n> Embody the key values & ideas contained in\nthe vision--―walk the talk‖\n> Maintain focus on improving the ways that\npeople work together in your team/organization\n> When a new task or change effort emerges,\nthink through how it will get done--who will do\nwhat, by when, and in what configuration\n> Play with new & different ways of organizing\nwork--examine alternative ways of grouping\npeople together, organizing their internal\ninteraction, & linking across different groups\n> Blend sensemaking & inventing\n\nLeading Change\n-\nUnintended development activities\n- LGO experience challenges your existing mental models and\nhelp you see gaps between prior assumptions and the root\ncause of problems\n-\n―System‖ implies you are a change agent\n- Do you really want to be a change agent?\n\nThe World as ―Insiders‖ See It\nOrganizational Assumptions\nWhat we see\nHow we see it\nWhat we do about what we see\n* J.

Interestingly, sometimes a stand-out leader was not the\nappointed leader for the iteration. Often, these stand-out leaders were\nable to assimilate the observations, warnings, and suggestions from the\nindividuals in the team, then make a firm decision on a single course of\naction, and focus the team's energy on completing the task through that\none course of action. Once the team got moving, these leaders also\nprovided \"distraction management\" to keep the team focused, made\nconsecutive decisions as more information about the problem was\ndiscovered, and consistently communicated guidance to the rest of the\nteam so that each individual knew his or her role in the solution.\nConversely, teams who did not complete the tasks on-time seemed to not\nhave one or more of these stand-out leaders. Often, they would expend\n75% of their allotted time in formulating a solution to the LRC task, leaving\nvery little time to make actual progress in applying the solution.\n\nSummer Teams\n- Think about the following questions individually for\n5 min., then as teams take 25 min. to prepare one\nFlipchart to share (no powerpoint!):\n- What do I want to carry forward to new teams (e.g., in\nthe Fall)? What will I practice, improve, master, become\nan artist at?\n- What do I want to leave behind? What will I (or my\nteammates) get rid of, not repeat?\n- Teams will report back for 3 min. each (MAX!)\n\nWhat I Wish I had Done (Alumni '91-01)\n-\nIn the last 11 years I've really come to appreciate that having a better\nunderstanding of myself is key to being a leader. (1993)\n-\nI think I was too caught up in doing coursework related activities\n(projects, homework, thesis, etc.) to take on informal leadership roles\nthat would have improved the LGO community. Some of my\nclassmates did a better job with this and I think they got a lot out of it.\n(1996)\n-\nI wish I'd have spent more time building networks both within LGO and\nthe broader MIT community. (1998)\n-\nUnderstood my own personal style and strengths more fully. (1999)\n-\nI think one thing that I've learned as a leader since LGO is that leaders\nneed to listen. LGO is so full of A-type personalities, that listening is\nsometimes in short supply. So I guess the one answer is that I wish I\nwould have listened more...(2000)\n\nWhat I Wish I had Done (Alumni '02-04)\n-\nIf I have one recommendation, it would be to somehow force people to\nget more involved... while the class work is indeed important, I felt they\nmissed out on some greater learnings, including a lot of networking\npractice. (2002)\n-\nI wish that we would have had a chance to really, I mean really, give each\nother some tough feedback... we need to discuss the un-mentionables\nwith each other - things that are not polite or easy to discuss, but which\ncould pose serious threats to our careers and leadership abilities. These\ninclude work habits, language, style, technical skills, etc. We need to\ndiscover and understand our weaknesses in the relatively safe\nenvironment of LGO so that we can have time to work on them. (2003)\n-\nLGO is a essentially a risk-free environment for learning more about one's\nleadership style, and I didn't take advantage of the opportunities available\n(including seeking active feedback from my peers). (2004)\n\nTransitions To New Teams\nConsider how your new teams will be different in\ncomposition, purpose, context!\n- You will be the lone LGO on an MBA team in OP,\nCommunications, Team Project, First Year Challenge, etc.\n- Are MBAs similar to or different from LGOs?\n- They may expect you to be the \"expert\"... summer at MIT,\nengineer, etc.\n- They may think you are \"pampered\" with tuition breaks, cushy\noffices, etc.\n- In what ways do you want to be \"special\" or \"one of them\"?\nWhat do you want from them? To give them?\n\nSteve Jobs\n#1 - dropping out of school & calligraphy class\nLesson: impossible to connect the dots looking\nforward... have to trust that the dots will connect\nin the future\n#2 - fired by Apple Board\nLesson: you have got to find what you love doing\n#3 - cancer\nLesson: don't be trapped by dogma\n\nLegacy Projects\n- LGO Committee Activity\n- CLFM\n- Knowledge sharing\n- International/domestic plant treks\n- Admissions/new partners\n- Mentoring undergraduates/youths\n- Volunteer/Service to the community\n- Sustainability (environment/alternative energy)\n- Healthcare\n- Entrepreneurship\n- Charity fundraisers\n\nThis Fall\n- Mid-stream review\n- Joint leadership session with 10's\n- Prosem speakers\n- Probe for leadership lessons\n- Don Davis/Bill Hanson seminar\n- 1-on-1's with Bill\n- LGO alumni mentor (contact Jan if you want one)\n- Leadership Labs\n- Plant trek prep sessions\n- 1-on-1's with Jan\n\nLearning to Lead\nPreparing\n- values\n- learning styles\n- coaching\nPreserving\n- self-insight\n- perspective\n- coaching\nExperience\nMeaning\nCrucible\n\"Experience is not so much what happens to you as what you make\nof what happens to you.\" Aldous Huxley\n\nLGOs in Sloan Teams\nYou are a network that connects the MBA\nteams.

      "content": "15.317\nBackground for Leadership Debates, Session 2\n\nAs we discussed the first day of class, historically, there have been two schools of thought on\nleadership. On Friday, we further explore these two views.\n\n1. Characteristic or Trait-Based Leadership - This theory argues that there are certain\npersonal characteristics or traits that leaders share in common, e.g., ambition &\nenergy, desire to lead, self-confidence, honesty & integrity, intelligence, ethical\nvalues, etc. Proponents believe that they are able to identify certain people in\nadvance as to their leadership abilities based on these traits. Some leaders are born\nwith these characteristics; others develop them over their lifetime.\n\n2. Situational Leadership - This theory argues that the situation within which the\nleadership takes place is as pivotal as the individual's characteristics. It assumes that\nleaders can and should change their leadership style to fit the personality of the\nfollowers, the task, their power, etc. The situation also provides a platform for\nleadership - it is up to the individual to grasp that opportunity and display leadership.\n\nIn class we will debate these two points of views through an in-depth look at two leaders.\nEveryone should read the background material on both leaders - Bono and Dr. Rene Favaloro.\n\nIn class we will watch a short video of each leader prior to each debate. I will then ask two\nstudents to take each side of the debate for each leader. Your debating position is determined by\nwhere you sit in the classroom:\nRight side (as you walk into classroom):\nDebate 1: Bono was an effective leader based on his personal traits or\ncharacteristics\nDebate 2: Dr. Favaloro was an effective leader based on his ability to adapt to or\ntake advantage of the circumstances he faced\n\nLeft side (as you walk into classroom):\nDebate 1: Bono was an effective leader based on his ability to adapt to or take\nadvantage of the circumstances he faced\nDebate 2: Dr. Favaloro was an effective leader based on his personal traits or\ncharacteristics\n\nThere will be two debates (one for each leader), each 20 minutes in length, with two-person\ndebate teams for each side of the argument for each leader. The format will be:\n-\nOne student will have three minutes to present the traits side of the argument, followed\nby another student presenting the situation side of the argument\n-\nThe second member of the debate teams will be given two minutes follow up for their\nside of the debate\n-\nThere will be seven minutes of Q&A by class\n-\nThe class will then vote on which team presented the most compelling argument (three\nminutes)\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n15.317 Organizational Leadership and Change\nSummer 2009\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."
