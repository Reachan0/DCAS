Threaded mechanisms\nIn many threaded mechanisms where low force and lubrication are used, the energy loss due to\nfriction and the energy stored in the bolt due to stretching are negligible compared to the\nwork done on the threaded mechanism. IF we can disregard the loss and stored energy, we\ncan develop an important relationship between the applied torque and exerted force.\nHowever, it is not good practice to simply ignore the energy loss and stored energy in our\ncalculations, we must make sure they are small compared to the other quantities involved.\nMathematically, we need:\nΣEloss + ΣEstretch <<< 1\nΣEexerted\n\"How much smaller\" than 1 depends on our desired accuracy. The smaller this ratio is, the more\naccurate our answer will be. Typically, the ratio should be less than 5%.\na). [5] Assume the preceding ratio is small enough so that the loss and stored energy may be\nneglected, derive the following relationship using an energy balance and the relationship\nbetween lead and travel for a single thread threaded mechanism: x = θ l\n(l = lead)\n2π\nProve: Fexert = 2πTapplied\nl\nb).

      "content": "CAD Tutorial - 1\nPurpose:\nIntroduce you to solid modeling and basic solid modeling\nfunctions.\nImportance:\nSolid Modeling is a way for scientists and engineers to\ngeometrically model their work, check for fit and function. The\n3D geometry created during Solid Modeling can be used to make\nblue prints, perform computer analysis (FEA or CFD), and create\nvisualizations.\nWhat to hand in:\nN/A\nGoals:\nAfter this activity, you will be able to:\n-\nLearn why Solid Modeling is important\n-\nLearn the process for creating good Solid Models\n- Learn the basic types of solid modeling 3D geometry\ncreations commands\n- Learn how to customize the Solid Modeling files for\nhanding in\nSoftware:\nThough you do not need to do this for lab, you may load\nSolidWorks(r) or Pro/ENGINEER(r) on your home/dorm computer.\nThis might save trips to campus late at night.\nSECTION 1: Introduction to Solid Modeling\nThe design and modeling processes are interdependent! It is difficult and irresponsible to\ndesign processes, machines, or other products without modeling how they will look and\nperform. Solid Modeling is one of the major steps in making machines and machine\ncomponents.\n1. Customer Modeling\n2. Requirement Modeling\n3. Analytic Modeling\n\n4. Solid Modeling (Geometric Modeling)\n5. Functional Modeling\nParametric Solid Modeling (PSM) is a useful tool, which will help you geometrically\nmodel your design(s). Solid modeling is not an easy skill to learn. You must know:\n-\nHow to run the software:\n-\nHow to use the software to get the results that you want (design intent)\nEventually, as you learn how to build models with the correct design intent, you will find\nthat solid modeling will:\n- Allow you to change your\ndesign with little effort\n- Help illustrate your designs\nto others\n-\nMake sure parts fit together\n-\nCheck for proper function\n-\nCheck for interference\n-\nMake drawings / blue prints\nThe introduction of PSM does not mean the demise of sketching!!! Sketching is one\nof the most valuable skills a designer can have to quickly convey ideas and layout a\ndesign. As a matter of fact, it is often a GOOD idea to sketch out your designs before\nyou proceed with PSM so that you can start to recognize the major shapes that make up\nyour part. This is important as robust solid models are made of the fewest and least likely\nto change features one need. You will come to learn that the process of rough sketching is\nvery similar to the process of solid modeling.\nSECTION 2: PSM Process\nLike the design process, PSM is best done when following a process. The general steps\nare listed below, you will learn them as you go through the tutorials.\n1. Determine what you want to do/make\n2. Develop concepts for getting the job done (i.e. what are the best\nshapes to model this?)\n3. Determine your design intent\n4. Draw/input any supporting geometry or sketches needed\n5. Draw a 2-D sketch\n6. Extrude, Revolve, Sweep, or Loft the 2-D sketch to make a 3-D\nobject\n7. Combine these objects into assemblies\n8. Make drawing of individual parts and assemblies with dimensions\n& tolerances\n\n9. Make files for use with:\n-\nComputer aided manufacturing (CAM) software\n-\nFEA (finite element analysis) software\n-\nDynamic modeling software\n-\nPhotographic rendering software\n-\nOthers\nSECTION 3: Basic Functions in Parametric Solid Modeling\nBefore discussing PSM in more detail, the reader should be familiar with the basic\noperations which can be used to make a solid model of a part/product. Note that when\napplicable, the illustrations below start out with a 2D sketch, then they are transformed\ninto 3-D geometry. The basic process may differ somewhat, depending on the CAD\nprogram you use.\nFunction\nWhat it's good for\nProcess\nSolid Extrusion\nSolid Extrusions are\noften used to:\n-\nMake the base\npart of a model\n-\nAdding\nbosses/features to\na model\n1. Pick/make a\nsketch plane\n2. Draw &\ndimension a 2-D\nsketch\n3. Issue \"extrude\nboss\" command\n4. Define extrusion\ntype (blind,\nmidplane, etc....)\n5.

Draw &\ndimension a 2D\nsketch\n3. Issue \"extrude\ncut/slot\"\ncommand\n4. Define extrusion\ntype\n5. Enter extrusion\ndepth if\nnecessary\nTo view, go to the Animations section\n\nRevolved Extrusion\nAdding features to a\nmodel which can best be\ndescribed in R-θ\ncoordinates. These\nfeatures include:\n-\nBase of a model\n-\nExternal\npipes/ducts\n-\nTorous shaped\nfeatures\n-\nAnnular\nfeatures/ribs\n1. Pick/make a\nsketch plane\n2. Draw &\ndimension a 2D\nsketch\n3.

      "content": "Excel Tutorial - Part I\nPurpose:\nIntroduce you to a powerful analytic, organization, and data\nlogging tool.\nImportance:\nMany times, research involves the organization and manipulation\nof information. There are many ways to do this, including\nprogramming, spreadsheets, and custom applications. We will\nuse Microsoft ExcelTM.\nWhat to hand in:\nN/A\nGoals:\nAfter this activity, you will be able to:\n-\nOpen and save files\n-\nInsert and organize data\n-\nInsert functions and calculations\n-\nPlot data\nSoftware:\nMicrosoft Excel\n\nSECTION 1: INTRODUCTION TO SPREAD SHEETS:\nWithin most spread sheet programs, you can:\n-\nInsert and organize data\n-\nInsert pictures/diagrams\n-\nDo simple and \"steroid\" engineering calculations\n-\nPlot the results\n-\nUse a built in optimization program\n-\nOtherwise manipulate your data\nThe working area of a spread sheet file consists of cells which are designated by which\nrow and column they fall into. For example there are 72 cells in the 12 rows and 6\ncolumns in the figure below. Although only 72 cells are shown, I have made spread\nsheets containing over 10,000 cells. Things to note:\n-\nCells can contain text, equations, images, and other useful things.\n- The gray boxes are not cells, they are the headings for the rows (1 - 12) and\ncolumns (A - F.)\n\nSECTION 2: MICROSOFT EXCEL GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE\n(GUI)\nExcel is a spread sheet program which is menu and icon based. The GUI is shown below.\nFollowing are short explanations of some of the menu items we will use in class.\n\nFILE MENU\nThe file menu is used to manage files. This includes:\n-\nOpen/save\n-\nPrinting\n\nEDIT MENU\nThe edit menu is mainly used to edit the content of your spread sheet, for purposes of this\nclass, you will find it most useful for using the copy/paste functions and the find function\n(will find text/numbers in large spread sheets.)\n\nINSERT MENU\nFrom the insert menu, you can choose to insert/add extra columns, rows, cells, and\nCHART/PLOTS!!! We will be using the plotting function to analyze and share the\nresults of your data. The next section will discuss this, but first....\nYou can use this menu to insert functions/equations (you could type them by hand.)\nTypical functions/equations would include trigonometric, averages, and sums of rows or\ncolumns. There are also logical (and/if/or) functions, statistical functions, and many other\nequations.\n\nSECTION 3: PLOTTING DATA WITH EXCEL\nSay you wanted to plot the equation y= x2.\nTo get the results (see graphic below,) I followed these steps:\n1. Click on cell A2 and type \"x\"\n2. Click on cell B2 and type \"y\"\n3. Click on A4 and enter \"1\"\n4. Click on A5 and enter \"2\"\n5. Continue adding numbers (as seen in graphic below) up to A8\n6. In Cell B4 type equation \"=A4*A4\" (you could also have typed A4^2)\n7. Copy cell B4 to B5 (B5 contents will now reference cells A5, not A4)\n8. Continue to copy this cell through B8\nYour results should look like this\n\nin the insert menu.\nTo make a plot, highlight the cells you want to pick. Then click on\nExcel will prompt you for the type of chart you wish to make; we will be using mostly\nscatter plots (#4.) To choose this type, highlight XY (Scatter) in the left window, then\nhighlight the chart type labeled #4 in the graphic.\n\nWith respect to why we are using the #4 chart type and not the others, consider the\nfollowing about each chart type:\n1. This type hard to see and communicate trends\n2. This type may lead others to make conclusions about trends, slopes, or at points for\nwhich you have no real data\n3. This type hard for some to see original data points\n4. This type works well; you should be able to say why considering types 1 -3...\nYou can finish the rest of the process by following the on screen instructions.\n\nSECTION 4: EXCERCISE EXCEL-1:\nMaximum fiber stress in a homogenous cantilevered beam:\nSpread sheets are very useful for playing what if games, iterative calculations, and\noptimizing designs. You can \"program\" the spread sheet to calculate say for instance, the\napproximate normal stress in a cantilever beam.\nThe stress depends on the INPUTS:\n-\nForce, F\n-\nBeam Length, L\n-\nBeam Thickness, t\n-\nBeam Width, w\nThe maximum stress in the beam occurs at the base of the beam (near where it is\nattached). The equation for the maximum fiber stress in the beam is:\nσ = M c / I\nEquation (1)\nWhere:\n- M = Moment at any point x, along the beam. M = F (L - x); x = distance from\nthe base.\n-\nc = Half thickness of the beam = 0.5 t\n-\nI = 2nd Area moment of inertia = (1/12) w t3\nDeliverable:\nYour task for this exercise is to develop a spreadsheet that will tabulate the maximum\nfiber stress at any point along the beam. The user should have the ability to change the\nfollowing variables: (F, L, t, w). When any change is made, the graphs should\nautomatically update. An example of a spreadsheet is provided below. You do not have to\nformat (borders, colors, etc) your spread sheet. Save your spreadsheet. You will need it\nlater."

You use FTP to transfer files from/to your\ncomputer to/from a server. You can also use FTP to transfer files from one computer to\nanother provided you have the right access privileges on both computers. This tutorial\ndeals with transferring the files that make up your web page to the server that contains\nyour personal accounts.\nAt the time you created your account, you were given some space on the server to use as\nyou wish. You can use some of this space to save your html files. In this way, anyone\nwith Internet access can view your html file by typing the appropriate address.\n\nFTP From the Laptops\nDuring the HTML tutorial you set up a directory in your server account to host your web\nfiles. Now you are about to transfer these files from the laptop you are using right now, to\nthat directory on the server.\n1. Click on the Start button\n2. Click on Programs\n3. Click on WS_FTP\n4. Click on WS_FTP95 LE\n5. When the program opens, fill in the blanks as shown and provide your username\nand password.\n6. Click on Ok\n7. A new window appears. On the left side, browse to the directory that contains\nyour web files and select them. You can selectively pick a group of files by\nholding down the ctrl key on the keyboard as you click on each file.\n8. On the right side, browse to the directory on the server in which you want to put\nyour web files (www).\n9. Now transfer the files by clicking on the corresponding button.\n10. You are done transferring your files. Now try browsing your web page on Internet\nExplorer or Netscape by going to your URL. It should be:\nhttp://web.mit.edu/username/www/home.html\n11.

      "content": "HTML tutorial\nPurpose:\nIntroduce you to basic web page coding. This is a basic tutorial which\nwill prepare you for the use of more sophisticated HTML editing tools.\nImportance: Very few people code HTML by hand anymore. There are a multiplicity\nof programs such as DreamWeaver and Microsoft Front Page which help\nmake the process of web page creation easier. BEFORE you learn to use\nthese tools, it is important to learn the basic structure and components of\nthe code/language. This will come in handy when you need to\ntroubleshoot code which editing tools can't fix.\nGoals:\nAfter this activity, you will be able to:\n-\nSet up your server account to serve your personal web page\n-\nBuild a basic text web page\n-\nFormat and stylize your web page font\n-\nAdd images to your web page\n-\nAdd and control hyperlinks\n\nSTEP 1: SETTING UP YOUR SERVER ACCOUNT TO HOST YOUR\nWEB FILES\nYou will be creating HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) documents. These are the\nfiles/instructions a browser (i.e. Netscape/Internet Explorer) reads and uses to show web\npages. In order to create your own home you need to place your HTML (Hyper Text\nMarkup Language) documents in a world readable directory named \"www\" in your home\ndirectory (on your server account). This directory is automatically created for new\naccounts, so in most cases you should not need to create it. If it DOES NOT exist (You\ndo not have to do this right now, but can hop over on one of the server machines if you\nwould like to check/do this), open the server and create this directory, using the following\ncommands:\ncd\nmkdir -p www\nfs sa www system:anyuser rl\nThis creates a directory named www into which you will place all file relating to your\nhomepage. Now, within that directory, you have to create a file (home.html) written in\nhtml format. Note that HTML documents MUST end in \".html\" or \".htm\". We will use\n\".html\" as our standard. Once you have created your home.html file, the URL for that\npage (your home page) would be: http://web.mit.edu/username/www/home.html. Anyone\nin the world can view this web page with a browser.\nSTEP 2: MAKING THE \"HTML\" WEB FILES\nHTML files are text files which contain the code of a web page. Today you will learn\nhow to program some basic HTML code. When beginning, it is best to use a simple text\neditor such as notepad or emacs. You can open notepad in the following way:\n1. Click on the Start Button\n2. Click on Run\n3. Type in: notepad\n4. Press ENTER on the keyboard\nThe notepad window should pop up, if not, ask for help.\n\nSTEP 3: LAYING OUT THE BASIC STRUCTURE OF THE PAGE\nHTML files have a basic structure that you MUST work within. Before you begin the\ntutorial you should type or copy/paste the following 8 lines from this screen into the text\nfile (file you have open in notepad):\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>MY HOME PAGE NAME</title>\n</head>\n<body>\nTHIS IS WHERE THE CODE FOR BODY (WHAT YOU SEE IN\nNETSCAPE/INTERNET EXPLORER) OF THE WEB PAGE GOES.\n</body>\n</html>\nThe text/bracket combinations are called tags. Note they come in pairs. There is always a\nbeginning tag (<title>) and an end tag (</title>). The beginning tag signals Netscape /\nInternet Explorer that a new tag/task is starting. The end tag tells Netscape / Internet\nExplorer that the tag/task has ended. You will learn more about these in the tutorial. Save\nthe above file to the desk top of your computer as: home.html. Make sure to add the\nextension \".html\" to the end of the file!!!!!\nSTEP 4: OPENING THE HTML FILE IN NETSCAPE/INTERNET\nEXPLORER\nNow you can view the results of your work:\n1. Go to or open Netscape/Internet Explorer\n2. File > Open or Open Page\n3. Press the Choose or Browse button\n4. Browse to the desktop and double click on home.html\n5. Click Open/OK to load the file\nIf this did not work, ask for help.\n\nSTEP 5: MAKING YOUR FILES READABLE ON THE WWW\nTo make your files accessible to the world (later on), you must store them in your server\naccount (You do not have to do right now, but you could ftp the file to the server if you\nwanted) within the www file. Later on, you can use Emacs or other text editor on the\nserver to edit the home.html file.\nSTEP 6: USING NETSCAPE/INTERNET EXPLORER AND THE TEXT\nEDITOR TO UPDATE AND VIEW THE RESULTS\nVERY IMPORTANT!!!!!\nInstead of copying and pasting the text from the tutorial into the Netscape/Internet\nExplorer browser text window (as suggested in the \"TRY IT YOURSELF SECTIONS!\"\nof the tutorial), you should paste the code into your home.html (inside notepad) file.\nYou can then reload the file into Netscape/Internet Explorer to see the results:\n1. Select the text from the tutorial you wish to copy\n2. Copy the text by pressing: Ctrl+C (the control and c key simultaneously)\n3. Switch to notepad\n4. Place the cursor where you want to paste the text\n5. Paste the text by pressing Ctrl+V\n6. Modify the text/code if you need to\n7. Save the file\n8. Load the file into Netscape/Internet Explorer, OR if you are already viewing the\nfile in Netscape/Internet Explorer, press the reload (called refresh in Internet\nExplorer) button to view the page with changes.\nUse this procedure to obtain experience in using a text editor and Netscape / Internet\nExplorer to write and debug your pages.\n\nSTEP 7: RUN THE TUTORIAL\nStart the tutorial at: http://www.davesite.com/webstation/html/index.shtml. Your job\ntoday is to finish chapters 1 - 5 of the tutorial on HTML. Chapter 0 is not necessary.\nYOU WILL HAVE TO MOVE FAST TO FINISH THIS!!!\n- Ch. 1: The Basics [What a tag is, Document Structure]\n- Ch. 2: The Common Tags [Headings and Horizontal Ruled Lines]\n- Ch. 3: More Common Tags [Paragraphs, Text Formatting, ALIGN, and\nLine Break]\n- Ch. 4: Links and Images\n- Ch. 5: A Little More Tags [Centering, BODY, etc.]"

      "content": "Project management tutorial\nPurpose:\nTo provide the basic skills and knowledge needed to effectively manage a\ngroup project.\nImportance: Project scheduling and understanding/handling risk is crucial to success in\nscience and engineering.\nGoals:\nAfter this activity, you will be able to:\n-\nBreak a complex project into manageable sub-projects\n-\nAssign responsibility/ownership of project components\n-\nSet reasonable milestone's for the completion of major tasks\n-\nPerform a risk analysis and integrate mitigation into your planning\n-\nDevelop and complete a project plan\nFiles:\nProject Management\n(Link provided on the section page)\n\nSECTION 1: INTRODUCTION TO PROJECT MANAGEMENT\nProject management is the art of matching a project's goals, tasks, and resources to\naccomplish a goal as needed. We say \"as needed\" because one has limited time, money,\nand resources (human and machinery) with which to accomplish a goal. One can think of\na project as a process. Figure 1 shows this process as a simplified block diagram.\nFigure 1: Simple Project Management System\nThe process involves inputs and outputs. Successful projects \"do the right things, with the\nright tools, and in the right way\".\n\nSECTION 2: STAGES OF A PROJECT AND HOW TO COMPLETE\nTHEM\nStage 1: Defining the goals of the project:\nGarbage in equals garbage out. If you do not start a project with the correct goal(s), it is\nnot likely you will accomplish the goal(s). This must be a team activity to ensure that\neveryone is given the opportunity to contribute and \"buy-in\" to what is going to happen.\nAt the end of this stage, every team member should have an understanding of what must\nbe accomplished.\nThis part of the project should end with a document that lists the goals with a short\nstatement providing some detail. The statement should include a definition of success.\nThis is a statement that provides a description of the vital few requirements that define\nthe goal as accomplished. Vital few implies the minimum required to do a good job.\nDefining success is necessary to make sure there is no ambiguity as to whether the goal\nhas been accomplished or not. It also prevents teams from performing unnecessary\niteration and improvement on a goal which has been sufficiently accomplished.\nStage 2: Define project tasks/activities:\nEach goal or sub-set of goals should be matched to the tasks required to accomplish them.\nThis is best done by listing the goals on the left side of a sheet of paper, then writing the\ntasks to their right. The group should agree that the specify task will accomplish the goals\nas per required in the definitions for success the team laid out in the previous stage.\nStage 3: Determine and verify resource requirements:\nResources are those things which are needed to accomplish the project goals. Resources\nmay include, but are not limited to:\n-\nPeople\n-\nTime\n-\nMoney\n-\nSpace\n-\nComputers\n-\nSoftware\n-\nOthers.....\n\nThe most important component of determining resource requirements is to be realistic.\nOne of the most common mistakes project managers make is to underestimate the amount\nand type of resources required. This leads to projects that run over budget and fall behind\nschedule. DO NOT attempt to do any of the following:\n-\nSqueeze a project into a shorter time frame to please your boss\n-\nCut corners to minimize resource requirements\n- Plan on a best-case basis, i.e. \"If everything goes correctly, we will finish on\ntime.\"\nDetermine what you need to get the job done correctly, on time, and on budget. It is not a\nbad idea to build in a safety margin here. This is often referred to as \"padding\". For\ninstance, one might multiply the estimated time to complete a task/project by say 20% to\nallow for additional time to deal with unexpected occurrences. The amount of padding\nusually depends on the certainty one has as to how effectively the resources can be used.\nOne should keep padding to a minimum.\nOnce the requirements have been set, it is important to verify that the team will have\naccess to them. If not, then it is not likely the project will be accomplished as required. In\nsome instances it may be necessary to acquire resources as the project progresses. This is\nrisky business and should be avoided if possible. This is risky business. Speaking of\nrisk...\nStage 4: Identify risks and develop mitigation (backup) plans:\nProjects always involve a finite amount of uncertainty (risk) that may lead to problems\nand surprises during the project. Dealing with surprises requires more time, energy, and\nmoney than originally planned. Risk management can help reduce the likelihood and\naffects of risks. Risk management is important as it helps the team accomplish the project\nwith as little trouble as possible.\nAs a professional scientist, engineer, or project manager, you will be required to help get\nthe job done. Excuses (whether real or imaginary) generally don't buy any sympathy. For\ninstance, in the event of a surprise problem which causes project delays, it is all to easy to\ndeflect responsibility with victim phrases such as, \"I did my part, but the other guy did\nnot.\" or \"We had an unexpected problem which caused us to fall behind.\" Managers,\nprofessors, CEOs typically do not look favorably on people who invoke victim phrases.\nAs a result, people who fall back on these types of phrases, even if they are true, typically\ndo not go far in this world. You must learn how to deal with surprises and adversity, not\nbe pushed around by them.\n\nBy becoming a member of a team, each member dedicates themselves to the success of\nthe TEAM. If you are waiting on a team member to accomplish a task and they are\nbehind, it is your responsibility to help them in any way you can. If you cannot help\nthem, you must make sure they get the help to accomplish their task. The victim phrase\ndoes not absolve you of any responsibility, rather it makes you look like you are not a\nteam player.\nRisk management can be a complex process, for our purposes, we will use a simple\nmanagement for dealing with the risk. Identify and list the practical risks for your tasks in\na column to the right of the tasks. For each risk, develop a back up plan that when\nimplemented will keep you on schedule. You may want to pay special attention to risks\nthat are so great, that they could \"kill\" the whole project. A member of the group should\nbe responsible for monitoring this risk throughout the project.\nStage 5: Develop a schedule\nA gant chart is a schedule which plots the tasks, people responsible for these tasks, and a\ntimeline. Gant charts are useful as they allow the team to look at the architecture\n(structure) of the project and easily identify responsibilities. The gant chart can serve as a\ndocument that people use in their planning as a visualization tool to see how tasks depend\non each other. The basic format of a gant chart consists of a listing of tasks on the left\nhand side, followed by the start date, number of days to complete, and a finish date. Each\ntask should be assigned one or more owners. To the right of the text listing is a graphical\nrepresentation of the task duration in the context of the project time line. A sample gant\nchart is shown in Figure 2.\nFigure 2: Sample Gant Chart\n\nAfter the chart is made, look for conflicts of resources. For instance, make sure that team\nmembers are not assigned too many tasks during a given time period. For instance, in the\nschedule above, Lisa appears to be busier than her team mates on July 02nd and 03rd.\nAlso make sure that different tasks which require the same machines or rooms are not\nscheduled for use at the same time. Make the changes and obtain agreement from the\ngroup that this is the schedule that is to be followed. It might be wise to review the risks\nduring this time and adjust parts of the schedule if it would help.\nStage 6: Execute the schedule\nJust do it! Every team member should know what they have to do and should have the\nright resources to get the job done.. They should know what the risks are and have back\nup plans in case of trouble. During this stage, the project manager is responsible for\ncoordinating, though group members should communicate among themselves as required.\nIf a group member feels he is going to go overtime/budget, it is their responsibility to\nbring it up to the group as soon as possible. This way, resources can temporarily be\nshifted to help keep the team member on schedule.\nEach group member should document their activities. This is important as human\nmemory is shaky at best and it is likely that each team member will be required to recall\ndetails of their activity. There is nothing more frustrating to a manager than to hear an\nemployee say, \"I can't remember what I did.\" If one can't remember, how can the team\ntrust that what they did was correct? Documentation is the responsibility of the team\nmembers and will often be a saving grace for them.\nIt is likely that surprises and conflicts may occur during the course of the project. It is\nimportant to remember that it is the team's responsibility to make the project happen. If\nthere are problems, the team should help figure them out. If there are conflicts, the team\nshould act together to resolve them. This can be facilitated by regular meetings (daily,\nweekly, monthly, whatever is practical) of the team. At the meetings the team should\nreview the schedule and the status (complete or not complete) of the project goals. Once\nthe goals are accomplished, the project is complete.\nStage 7: Finish the project and assessing performance\nAfter the goals have been achieved, it is good practice to evaluate the performance of the\nproject team. In the last group meeting the team should discuss ways in which the\nexperience could have been improved. This is where a good deal of learning and\nexperience is gained. It will help prevent similar problems in future projects.\n\nSECTION 3: PROJECT MANAGEMENT IN OUR ACTIVITIES.\nProject management is in large part about being responsible. Today's high school and\ncollege programs rarely force young people to exert their discipline. Most people say it is\nimpossible for young adults to manage themselves. I do not agree. Consider World War\nII. People between the ages of 17 and 22 formed the bulk of the force that fought in the\nwar. They were responsible for flying fighter planes, bombers, driving tanks, and steering\nships. These are huge responsibilities. If they can do this so can you.\nYou will be responsible for developing (with our help), implementing, and executing\nyour own project schedule. There will be no \"mercy\" for falling behind, except in the\nmost extreme of circumstances. Basically, it is your turn to step up to the plate and get\nthe job done.\nSECTION 4: ACTIVITY - START YOUR PROJECT\nThis is an incredibly open ended task. You are now charged with developing your project\nplan. Follow the steps above and proceed as best you can. Ask the staff for help if you\nhave questions.\nAt the beginning of this document, you can download a template for a project\ndevelopment sheet and a gant chart. All that is required of the user is to fill in the yellow\ncells. The gant chart will automatically plot out the task/project time line for you. This is\na required part of your project management activities."

      "content": "Microsoft PowerPoint tutorial\nPurpose:\nIntroduce you to a powerful software tool in order to create clear\nand meaningful presentations\nImportance:\nMicrosoft PowerPoint has basically become the industry standard\nfor giving presentations. You will need to become proficient in it\nduring the NASA RISE program in order to give weekly\npresentations on scientists of color, and a final presentation on the\nresearch\nproject\nthat\nyou\nwill\nbe\nworking\non.\nWhat to hand in:\nN/A\nGoals:\nAfter this activity, you will be able to:\n-\nEffectively organize a presentation\n-\nCreate aesthetically pleasing slides\n-\nInsert images and charts\nSoftware:\nMicrosoft PowerPoint\nSECTION 0: PREPARING FOR A PRESENTATION:\nWhy do we give presentations:\nThe scientific world revolves around sharing information. This can be done in written,\ngraphic, or verbal form. It is ULTRA important that you be able to communicate in all\nforms. This can make or break your career. You need to understand the factors that\ninfluence your preparation. Your purpose, the audience, and the context in which you are\nto deliver your presentation should determine the content, organization, tone, and the\nmediums (slides, video, etc...) you use.\nFigure 1: Factors Affecting Presentation Planning\n\nWhat is critical for success in a good presentation?\nGood content - If your presentation has the right content, you are half way to making a\ngreat presentation. The ability to include the correct content is a strong function:\n-\nHow well you know your audience\n-\nHow your presentation is organized. Is it logical?\nInterest - Is the content worthy of the audience's time?\n- It is easier to give a presentation to 5 interested people than to 100 people who are\nbored stiff. Make sure you have targeted the correct audience to avoid this\nsituation.\n- Even if you \"peg\" your audience correctly the first time, you should make sure\nyou emphasize the reason(s) why your presentation is important.\nClarity - Your ability to explain clearly with words, text, and graphics determines how\nclearly your message comes across.\n- Use your storyboard (you will learn about this in a few sections below) to\norganize and experiment with the best means (pictures, tables, charts) to get your\ninformation across.\n-\nShow your storyboard to a peer and have them provide feedback on the content.\nPoise and confidence - Stage fright is not a laughing matter. Uncertainty leads to stage\nfright. Sooo..... minimize the uncertainty you have about your presentation. I recommend\nthe following when preparing for a presentation:\n- Go to the room where you are to present and become familiar with the\nsurroundings.\n- Identify any cords (tripping is embarrassing), furniture, equipment, or other items\nwhich may get in your way. Move them before your presentation if you can. If\nthey cannot be moved, make sure you anticipate their position when you practice.\n- Make sure the lighting is adequate. Know how to turn the lights off and on. You\ndo not want to be stuck trying to figure out how to turn a light bulb on in front of\n100 people....\n- Get sleep! It is hard to be at your best if you stayed up the entire night getting\nready... To avoid this, have all your slides and materials you will need for the\npresentation ready 1 - 2 days before your presentation.\n- Stage fright is usually most intense in the first 20 -30 seconds. Use your first 20 -\n30 seconds in front of your audience to get set up (i.e. place your slides, position\nyour equipment, etc...).\n- Memorize what you are going to say for the first 1-2 slides. This will help ensure\nyou get off to a smooth start. If you feel comfortable after the first couple of slide,\nyou will feel better as you proceed through the presentation. Remember though, it\nis not practical to memorize you entire presentation; just the first couple slides is\nenough.\n\n- PRACTICE!!! I recommend 1-2 \"run-throughs\" where you sit and read through\nthe slides organizing the main points and phrases you want to say. Practice 2-3\ntimes \"in the real\" where you stand up and either use an overhead or projector.\nThen practice 1-3, timing yourself each time, to ensure that you will not go\novertime.\n- DO NOT BE AFRAID to start over. If you get into the first slide and get tripped\nup, you might feel better sayings, \"Sorry, let me start over again.\" This is quite\ncommon, use it if you need it.\nSECTION 1: BASIC GUIDELINES FOR PRESENTATIONS:\nNo matter what type of presentation it is, you must:\n- Obey all copyright rules and reference where you get images, data, or quotes. For\ntext, this will require an author's last name and page number in parenthesis. For\nimages, you must obtain permission first!!! If you use an image that is not of your\nown creation, we will require and email or fax providing permission. Once you\nhave obtained permission, you must place a caption recognizing the maker/owner\nof the graphic. For web-based materials/photos/images, a URL will suffice.\nExample: \"The NASA RISE program provided me with a unique perspective on\nprecision engineering.\" (Ascher 57)\nFigure 1.1: Name?\n-\nTalk to your audience and relate relevant discussion topics to them\n-\nMake eye contact with your entire audience.\n-\nBody language is important. Stay relaxed.\n-\nAnnunciate with a clear voice. Do not mumble.\n-\nPractice at least twice before giving actual presentation\n-\nAlways time yourself\n- Keep in mind the lighting of the room. This will affect the audience's ability to\nview screen.\n\nSECTION 2: CREATE A \"STORY BOARD\"\nBefore starting a to input information into PowerPoint, it is often helpful to create a story\nboard. This is basically an outlined schematic of the major points of your presentation. It\nshould give a general idea of where pictures or charts will go, and the order in which you\nwill talk about them. NOTE: You should sketch this by hand on paper. This is much\nfaster than drawing with a ruler, CAD, or inside PowerPoint. You do not need to use\nrulers, just make sure your sketches are legible and convey the point.\nFigure 2.1: Example Storyboard\n\nSECTION 3: MICROSOFT POWERPOINT GRAPHICAL USER\nINTERFACE\n(GUI)\nPowerPoint creates presentations using slides. The GUI is menu and icon based and is\nshown below. Following are short explanations of some of the menu items we will use in\nclass.\nFigure 3.1 : MicroSoft PowerPoint GUI\n\nFILE MENU\nThe file menu is used to manage files.\nThis includes:\n-\nOpen/save\n-\nPrinting\nFigure 3.2 : MicroSoft PowerPoint File Menu\n\nEDIT MENU\nThe edit menu is mainly used to edit the\ncontent of your slides. For purposes of this\nclass, you will find it most useful for using\nthe copy/paste functions. It will copy and\npaste virtually any element of a slide.\nFigure 3.3 : MicroSoft PowerPoint Edit Menu\n\nINSERT MENU\nFrom the insert menu, you can choose to\ninsert/add new slides, images (.jpeg and\n.gif), movie files (.avi and .mpeg), charts\nand plots, and objects (Excel, Word, and\nSolidWorks files).\nFigure 3.4 : MicroSoft PowerPoint Insert Menu\nFORMAT MENU\nFrom this menu, you can add colorful\ntemplates and background colors to make\nyour\npresentation\nvery\naesthetically\npleasing.\nHOWEVER, you must be careful that they\nare not \"so colorful\" that they become\ndistracting.\nIn darker rooms, a lighter background with\ndark text will be easier on the audience's\nvision than a dark background with light\ntext. In a well-lit room, both work equally\nwell.\nFigure 3.5 : MicroSoft PowerPoint Format Menu\n\nSLIDE SHOW MENU\nHere, Sounds and Animation can be added to words, objects, and images in your slides\nby selecting Action Settings and Custom Animation respectively. It can also be reached by\nselecting the element and right clicking.\nThere is also a Rehearse Timings command which allows you to time your presentation.\nDRAWING TOOLBAR\nFigure 3.7 : Drawing Toolbar\nThis is located in the lower left-hand side of your screen. It will allow you to draw\nimages yourself using the Draw, AutoShapes, and other icons. This will allow you to\ncreate schematics, flowcharts, and many other useful images, such as the example below.\nFigure 3.8 : Examples of AutoShapes Available Via Sketch Toolbar\n\nYou can ALSO USE PowerPoint to annotate pictures for your presentation and report!!!\nThis is an ULTRA STEROID useful tool and will save you a lot of time. For instance, the\nfollowing figure was imported into PowerPoint, then lines and text were added using the\ndrawing tools.\nFigure 3.9: Figure Annotated In PowerPoint\nAnother useful command is the Group / Ungroup option, which allows you to group a lot\nof smaller images into one large image. This often facilitates moving things around on\nthe slide. This option is reached by selecting the images and right clicking.\n\nSECTION 4: THINGS TO KEEP IN MIND\n- Do Not Crowd Slides\nA rule of thumb is approximately 15-20 words per slide. If you stray too far from this,\neither your audience will not read it, or they will read it and become too preoccupied and\nnot listen to you. When giving presentations, the slides act as a guide to summarize the\nmajor points, and what you say should provide all the pertinent details.\nFigure 4.1 : Example Plot\n- IMPORTANT: All graphics, sounds and animation should never interfere with\nyour ability to communicate information. They should always HELP this process.\nBe wary of using these options in excess; overkill is possible.\n\nSECTION 5: Generic Layout of a Presentation\nHere is an example of a Presentation done by MIT Freshmen at the end of a two-week\nProduct Design\nPowerPoint Presentation\nThe layout of a presentation depends on the goal of the presentation. If you are giving an\ninformation based presentation which is a conglomeration of facts (i.e. your Friday\npresentations) then you\nHere is a Generic outline of presentation elements:\n1) Title Page\na) Identify yourself and your affiliation, the project title, and the date\nb) This page typically has a photo or some other graphic\n2)Introduction\na) State the purpose of the discussion. You should answer the question: \"Why are we\nall here?\"\nb) Engineers and scientists are not fond of \"mystery stories\" in presentations. In this\nslide you should have identified:\n- The problem/purpose/challenge\n- The solution and how well it does the job\n- Why this presentation/work is important\n3) Topics of Discussion\na) State the main ideas you'll be talking about\n4) Topic One\na) Details about this topic\nb) Supporting information and examples\nc) How it relates to your audience\n\n5) Topic Two\na) Details about this topic\nb) Supporting information and examples\nc) How it relates to your audience\n6) Topic Three\na) Details about this topic\nb) Supporting information and examples\nc) How it relates to your audience\n7) Real Life\na) Give an example or real life anecdote\nb) Sympathize with the audience's situation if appropriate\n8) What This Means\na) Add a strong statement that summarizes how you feel or think about this topic\nb) Summarize key points you want your audience to remember\n9) Next Steps\na) Summarize any actions required of your audience\nSummarize any follow up action items required of you\nSECTION 6: TODAY'S ACTIVITIES:\nWork on creating your presentation for Friday. Start with the story board, then ask the\nstaff to look at/review it. After this, you may start on your PowerPoint files for Friday.\nTry to get finished today so that you may practice tonight/tomorrow before the \"real\nthing\"."
