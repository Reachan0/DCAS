This problem set\ngives you some experience in using these exchange and formation reactions.\n\n1) The equation for the Fe-Mg exchange reaction (KD\nFe-Mg ) is found in the course notes.\nSimplify the exchange reaction by substituting an ideal model for the activities of Fe and\nMg in the olivine and the melt.\n\nThus: aFo\noliv = XFo oliv and aMgO liq = X MgO liq\n\nNow use these expressions. the value of KD\nFe-Mg and the relations: XMgO = 1 - XFeO to\ndevelop expressions that allow you to predict XFo oliv in terms of X MgO liq and X MgO liq in\nterms of XFo oliv .\n\n2) With your newly derived expression for olivine and melt Fe-Mg characteristics carry\nout the following tasks:\n\na) Predict the Mg# (this is a commonly used expression that is = X MgO liq) of a\n\nliquid in equilibrium with Fo90 olivine.\n\nb). Calculate the Fo content of the liquidus olivine for a melt with an Mg# = 0.83.\n\n3) Table 1 of Baker et al. gives the composition of a lava and the most Fo-rich olivine\nfound in the lava.\n\na) Use the expressions given by Roeder and Emslie to calculate the\ncrystallization\n\ntemperature.**\n\nb) We usually use this temperature as an estimate of the liquidus temperature for\n\nthe rock. Why is this a good assumption?\n\nc) What test should you always perform before you use the olivine and rock\n\ncomposition to calculate a crystallization temperature?\n** Note that you will have to use the appropriate units for the Roeder and Emslie\nexpressions. These are mole % of the oxides in mineral and melt. The compositions of\nthe rock and olivine are given in wt. %. Transform to mole % by dividing by gram\nformula weight of each oxide and renormalizing to 100%.\n\nReferences:\n\nBaker et al. \"Origin of compositional zonation (high-alumina basalt to basaltic andesite)\nin the Giant Crater lava field, Medicine Lake volcano, northern Calfornia.\" Journal of\nGeophysical Research 96 (1991), 21819-21842.\n\nRoeder, P.

For a bulk composition that is 20 wt. % Cr2O3 describe\nthe equilibrium crystallization path and subsolidus behavior from above the liquidus\n(~2800 oC) to 1400 oC.

Start from above the liquidus (>1400 oC) and give the\ntemperature and nature of all reactions that will occur during this process. Also, identify\nthe temperature and composition of the last liquid that will be the end product of a\nfractional crystallization process. Now, contrast the fractional crystallization path with\nan equilibrium crystallization path.\n\n2) For the system Fo - Di - An construct isothermal sections at 1500, 1400, 1300 and\n1200 oC.

      "content": "12.109\nPetrology\nProblem Set #3\n1. Geothermometry and Geobarometry - an example using mineral solutions.\nThis exercise illustrates how you can use mineral compositions in metamorphic rocks to\nobtainestimates of the P-T conditions under which rocks form in the earth's interior. This\nexample is discussed in Spear's book on p. 515-536 and is a metamorphic rock from New\nEngland that contains the phases: biotite, plagioclase, garnet, quartz, and the mineral\nkyanite. In addition, rocks in the immediate vicinity of this sample contain andalusite\nand sillimanite. So, this implies that the conditions of formation of the sample are very\nnear the pressure and temperature of the invariant equilibrium in the Al2SiO5 one-\ncomponent system (the triple point).\nThe accompanying Table from Spear contains the compositions of the minerals that are\nfound in this rock. Two equilibria are used to estimate the conditions. They are:\nAnorthite = Grossular + Kyanite + Quartz\n(1)\n3 CaAl2Si2O8 = Ca3Al2Si3O12 + 2 Al2SiO5 + SiO2\nThis reaction is called the GASP reaction and the expression of the equilibrium constant\nis:\n0 = -48357 + 150.66 T (oK) + (P-1) (bars) (-6.608) + RTlnKeq\nand\nFe3Al2Si3O12 + KMg3AlSi3O10(OH)2 = Mg3Al2Si3O12 + KFe3AlSi3O10(OH)2\nAlmandine\n+ Phlogopite\n=\nPyrope\n+ Annite (2)\nThis is an exchange reaction and the symbol used for the equilibrium constant is KD. The\nacronym for this reaction is GARB.\nThe expression for this equilibrium is:\n52,112 - 19.51 T (oK) + 0.238 P (bars) + 3 RTln KD = 0\nApply these two thermometers and determine the conditions of P and T indicated by the\nminerals. Assume that the mineral solutions are ideal.\nFor example, that means the for the GASP reaction, the activity of grossular in garnet is:\naGross\nGarnet = (XGross\nGarnet 3)\naAn\nPlag = XAn\nPlag\n\na\nFor the GARB reaction the activities of the components are given by their Fe/(Fe+Mg)\nand Mg/(Mg+Fe) values:\nAlm\nGarnet = XFe\nGarnet = Fe/Fe+Mg\nand\naPyr\nGarnet = XMg\nGarnet= (1-[Fe/Fe+Mg]).\nSo, work through this example and calculate P and T using both expressions. How close\ncan you get to the aluminosilicate triple point?"

      "content": "12.109 Lab 6\n13 Oct., 2005\nDue 20 Oct., 2005\nBasalts\nWe, as geologists, care about basalts for many reasons. One is that they contain more\ninformation about mantle magmatic processes than any other rock-type. Therefore, a\nhuge amount of work has been done on them, and this work shows that, in fact, mantle\nmagmatic processes are incredibly complicated. This lab is meant to introduce you to a\nfew different types of basalts from dfferent tectonic settings. Also, you will be exposed\nto some of the techniques petrologists use to explore crustal and mantle processes by\nlooking at basalts. Many of the more open-ended questions below require more than a\nsentence answer to discuss in any meaningful detail.\n1. Look at ANTUCO, LLIAMA, ML1907, MEX, 528-1-1, and ALV 824-3.\nFill out petrographic reports for these samples.\nQuestions 2-6 refer to 528-1-1 and ALV 824-3 only.\n2. Using the CIPW norms given on the attached sheet, plot and classify 528-1-1 and\nALV 824-3 in the Basalt Tetrahedron. Why is this a useful thing to do?\n3. Assume for the moment that these basalts are primary liquids derived from olivine-\nrich mantle sources. What do the compositions of these basalts tell us about the\ncomposition of their source regions? (Use the olivine/melt KD (Fe/Mg))\nNow for the more important question. Are the assumptions you made above valid?\nWhy or why not? How does this affect the validity of your calculation? Write a\nparagraph or two on this one.\n4. Do these samples represent quenched liquids? How can you tell? Why is this\nimportant?\n5. Based on their textures, do the olivine phenocrysts in these samples appear to be in\nequilibrium with the surrounding matrix? What does this tell you?\n6. Given that we believe the Earth's upper mantle is 60-80% Forsterite rich olivine (of\ncomposition Fo88-90) and assuming these samples do represent quenched liquids, are\nthese basalts probably primary magmas?\n\n12.109 Lab 6\n13 Oct., 2005\nDue 20 Oct., 2005\n7. Look at thin section (2)129-KB and its associated hand sample. These are Komatiites\ndisplaying spinifex texture. Sketch an example of this texture as seen in thin section.\n8. Of the basalt thin sections in the box, find and sketch examples of intergranular,\nintersertal, and hyalopolitic textures. Arrange the samples in order of cooling rate,\nfastest cooled first.\n9. ANTUCO and LLIAMA are basalts from a continental arc setting. Compare and\ncontrast these rocks with ML1907 (a hawaiian basalt) and 528-1-1 (a MORB). Could\nyou tell what tectonic setting the basalt came from simply by looking at a thin-\nsection? If not, then what techniques would you use (I ask this because in many non-\nmodern volcanic rocks, learning more about the tectonic setting is the goal of the\nstudy, and not a given)? What might you expect to find?"

      "content": "12.109 Lab 7\nArc Volcanoes - A case study of Mt. Doom\nOn our fieldtrip the other day, you witnessed physical evidence for processes such as magma-\nmixing and assimilation, and fractional crystallization was discussed (if you need a refresher on what\nthese processes are, do some reading). The importance of these processes in magma genesis and\nevolution beneath volcanic arcs cannot be stressed enough. As an illustration, I give you real samples\nfrom a continental setting and place them into a fictitious setting for your enjoyment. Welcome to Mt.\nDoom - a typical calc-alkaline volcano (\"raining down doom since 2003\").\nFigure 1 is a figurative cross-section through Mt. Doom, vaguely illustrating the growth-history\nof the volcano as a series of volcanic eruptions of various compositions. Blown-up to the right of the\nvolcano is stratigraphic-section A, which is composed of six lava flows which all erupted from the same\nvent (i.e. each flow came from the same hole). The goal of this lab is to examine the macroscopic,\nmicroscopic and geochemical characteristics of these rocks so that you can better understand the\nmagmatic processes occurring at depth. Undoubtedly, the progressive evolution of these lava flows will\nsomehow involve fractional crystallization, assimilation and magma-mixing, but our goal is to figure\nout whether or not we can discern which processes are dominating over the course of these eruptions.\n1. The normal way to investigate a series of rocks of known stratigraphic relation is from the bottom up\n- oldest to youngest. We will do the same here. Examine both the hand sample and thin section for 79-\n35d, 79-33b and 79-8a.\na. For each of these, do the following: Identify the phenocrysts, and estimate their abundances (and I\nmean estimate). Keep this in the back of your mind: which phases were on the liquidus at the time of\neruption? Make sure that you are convinced that each of the phases you identify are in equilibrium with\nthe magma - if they are not, make a note of it.\nb. Now look at table 1 and examine the geochemical composition of these rocks. Based on the\nmineralogy you saw in thin section and the major-element chemistry, give each of the rocks a name (if\nyou don't know how to name a rock based on its geochemistry, read about it).\nc. Examine the chemical composition of these rocks in more depth. Compare the abundances of each\nof the major elements in each of the rocks to one another. Are there any striking trends in the\ngeochemistry as you move up stratigraphically (pay particular attention to MgO, CaO, and Al2O3)?\nd. Using what you saw in thin-section, and taking the geochemistry into account, what is the simplest\nexplanation for the relationship of these three magmas? Explain your answer.\n2. Now that we have that figured out, we can move upwards. Examine the hand sample and thin\nsection for sample 79-26.\na. Again, identify the phenocrysts, estimate their abundances and using the information in table 2, name\nthe rock. Are all the phenocrysts in equilibrium with the magma?\n\n12.109 Lab 7\nb. Pay particular attention to the plagioclase in this sample - yes, many of them show wonderful zoning.\nFigure 6.1 at the back of this handout has the Ab-An phase diagram, which you are all familiar with.\nUse this diagram and table 2 to explain the observed zoning. Is this story consistent with the one you\ncame up with for the lava flows stratigraphically below? In what ways is it, and in what ways isn't it?\n3. There is additional information that we can retrieve from this lava flow. Samples 97-8 and -9 were\ncollected as enclaves within this flow. An enclave is essentially a cognate xenolith, but the implication\nis that it coexisted as a magma at the same time as its host rock. In other words, the enclave is an\nimmiscible liquid within the host magma. These particular enclaves are somewhat misleading, because\nthey are coarse-grained, perhaps implying that they are simply xenoliths. However, their rims exhibit\nquenched texture, showing that they were at least partially-molten when they became included in the\nmagma represented by 79-26.\na. How do you think that these enclaves ended up in the magma represented by sample 79-26?\nb. Identify the phenocrysts present in the enclaves (don't bother estimating their percentages). What\ndoes their texture tell you about their history?\nc. Using the mineralogy and table 2, give 97-8 and 97-9 names.\nd. Finally, does the presence of these enclaves help explain the textures and the geochemistry of sample\n79-26? Why and/or why not?\n4. I think you get the picture - I have asked enough leading questions. For the next three samples,\nconduct similar tests by looking at their thin-sections, the geochemistry, and their stratigraphic\nrelationships. You decide what the interesting information is and tell it to me (this is what geology is -\nusing tools to distil lots of information into bite-size stories). You should be able to sum it up in a\ncouple of paragraphs with any lists or sketches you deem necessary.\n5. The final step in any igneous petrology paper which tries to explain magma-chamber processes is to\ndraw little box diagrams with magma-chambers and dikes and little crystals leading to other magma-\nchambers, and eventually with a dike leading to the bottom of a smoking volcano. Now you should do\nthat (this is your reward for having done all that work). The basic idea is to take the relative-timing of\nthe processes you described above and drawing sketches that make the information easier to understand.\nIt should also give us some physical sense of what is happening beneath Mt. Doom. Attached to the\nback of this handout are some examples from some of Tim's papers and one from Bair's senior thesis.\nThe biggest mistake people make is over-interpreting what they actually have evidence for."

The tetrahedron is\nconstructed using the normative components olivine, quartz, clinopyroxene, and\nnepheline.\n\nThere are six volumes in the tetrahedron that define the different groups:\n\nName\n\nNormative components\nI\nQuartz tholeiite\nOversaturated\nQuartz and hypersthene\nII\nTholeiite\nSaturated\nHyp\nIII Olivine tholeiite\nUndersaturated\nOlivine and hyp\nIV Transitional basalt or\nolivine basalt\n\nNo normative hyp, only oliv\nV\nAlkaline oliv basalt\nCritically undersaturated\nOliv and nepheline\nVI High Al basalt\nHigh Al from plag\nPlagioclase\n\nNote that there is a low pressure thermal divide (oliv-plag-cpx) that separates alkali\nolivine basalts from tholeiites.\n\nBasalt series - We can think of three end member series, which represent the major types\nof basalt magmas and their fractionation products.\n\nAlkali olivine basalt series\n\nAOB > hawaiite > mugearite > trchyte > phonolite (pantellerite)\n\nRock series characteristic of oceanic islands and continental rift environments\n\nTholeiite basalt series\n\nTholeiite > andesite > dacite > rhyolite\n\nRock series characteristic of ocean floor and continental arc or island arc settings\nAlso, high alumina basalt can be the parent of this series\n\nAre basalts produced by melting a single source? Or melting source regions of\nvariable composition?\n\nMelting experiments on simple systems and on natural basalts showed that the range of\nobserved basalts could be derived by melting a single source region - IF melts were\nproduced at different pressures\nAlkali olivine basalts come from deep\nOlivine tholeiites come from melting at shallower depths\n\nEvidence - shrinking of olivine primary phase volume with increasing pressures. Melts\nat the olivine + high-Ca pyroxene (cpx) + low Ca pyroxene (opx) become more olivine\nrich as P increases\n\nMultiple saturation hypothesis - where liquidus of a basalt is saturated with more than\none mineral = multiple saturation point given T, P, and residue of melt generation\n\nOlder (1960s-1970s) model for basalt genesis involved melting in a single stage of\nmantle source of fixed composition. This model was generally successful but had several\nshortcomings:\nI.\nBasalts in nature never saturated with all the phases that would be expected to\nbe present in a mantle source. E.g. usually a basalt has olivine and hi-Ca\npyroxene on its high pressure liquidus - it should also have low-Ca pyroxene\n(opx) as this is the second most abundant solid phase in a mantle peridotite\nsource and an aluminous phase.\nII.\nBasalt magmas rarely have MgO and FeO that are in equilibrium with Mg and\nFe in mantle phases. The minerals in basalts are richer in FeO and poorer in\nMgO, indicating that melt has cooled, crystallized, and become modified\nduring process of ascent and after melting from the original source.\nModifying processes could include aggregation/mixing of multiple partial\nmelts and differentiation.\n\nMORB (Mid Ocean Ridge Basalt) genesis - two inseparable processes:\n1. melt generation 2. melt modification\n\n1. partial melting -\n- near fractional\n- occurs during adiabatic ascent\n- mantle cools, melts, and continually changes composition\n\n2. fractional crystallization\n- deep and/or shallow?\n- melt compositional variation provides evidence\n- minerals in MORB provide evidence\n\nmelting by adiabatic ascent:\nq\nP\ndT\ngT\ndP\nC\nα\n⎞=\n⎟⎠\n∼1oC/kbar or 0.3o/km (see Hess, p. 102)\n\nDynamics of melting: melt forms an interconnected network at low melt fractions, along\ngrain boundaries\n\nGlobal trends of Na-Fe @ 8.0% MgO show high Na % associated with low Fe % and\nvice versa\nNa reflects % fractional melting because Na is an incompatible element.\nFe reflects depth of melting - high FeO Æ high olivine content\n{Depth to spreading center, crustal thickness, MORB chemistry} all interrelated"

XVII.\nMarmo (1967) Earth Sci Rev 3:7-29.\n\nProposed origins of granite problem and misconceptions\n\n1) Metasomatic granitization on a large scale without participation of a silicate\nmelt... Origin by hydrothermal replacement or solid diffusion\n\n2) Granites' derivative liquids produced by fractional crystallization of basalt...\nOrigin as magmatic liquids.\n\n3) What are sources of magmas? Where are these located?\n\n4) Enormous \"granite\" batholiths are not granite. Much of the plutonic rock is\ngranodiorite - tonalite - quartz diorite.\n\nTuttle and Bowen's (1958) [GSA Memoir 74] experimental work distinguished between\nhypotheses 1) and 2). Bowen and Tuttle showed that the system Ab-Or-Qtz-H2O\ncontained a ternary minimum and that all granites plotted near that minimum. The\neasiest way to produce such a clustering is by fractional crystallization.\n\nToday's major granite problem is source for the large continental batholiths.\n\nInformation contained in granitic rocks\n\nCompositions of spatially and temporally related granitic rocks may record a \"liquid line\nof descent\" at some P, T, and PH2O.\n\nSome strange textures in granites have also intrigued petrologists. Rapakivi = plagioclase\nfeldspar overgrowths on alkali feldspar. Anti-rapakivi = alkali feldspar overgrowths on\nplagioclase. The proposals for the origin of these different textures center around the role\nof variable T, P, and H2O on the termination of the two feldspar + liquid (2 fsp + liq)\nboundary curve.\n\nAnti-rapakivi, the mantling of plagioclase by alkali feldspar, is found in many rocks...\nfrom absarokite to shoshonite to syenite (these are rocks with low aSiO2 and PH2O).\nUsually low-pressure environments. Experiments at low P show that the 2 fsp + liq curve\nlies on the alkali feldspar side of the solvus-solidus intersection. Therefore, one can\nexplain the alkali feldspar rims on plagioclase as a consequence of low P fractional\ncrystallization. This is the equivalent to a peritectic reaction,\n\nPlag + Liq = Kspar\n\nSometimes (Often) there is no reaction overgrowth relation in two feldspar rocks. This\nobservation is consistent with increasing aSiO2 and PH2O. Experimental results show that\nincreases in H2O and SiO2 make the 2 fsp + liq boundary a cotectic.\n\nRapakivi textures are harder to explain. Quartz is present in rapakivi associations. There\nis no evidence from phase relations that the 2 fsp + liq curve lies on the plag side of the\nsolidus-solvus intersection under any P or aH2O conditions. The experiments show that\nthe 2 fsp + liq boundary is either plagioclase peritectic or cotectic all the way.\n\nWhat is the explanation, then? Degassing - a decrease in PH2O causes the 2 fsp + liq\nboundary to move toward the alkali feldspar corner. This movement decreases the area\nof the alkali feldspar liquidus field, and a liquid on the 2 fsp + liq boundary at higher\npressures will find itself in the plag primary phase volume after a pressure drop. An\nintriguing thought is that rapakivi granites may be the recorders of catastrophic silicic\nvolcanic eruptions!"

For the example\nbelow, b/(a+b) = % liquid and a/(a+b) = % anorthite.\n\nBinary system with a eutectic\n\nThis is an example of congruent melting. The idea is that the two things melt to some\nintermediate composition, but you need to know the phase diagram or the thermodynamic\nproperties to determine the composition of the melt. Eutectic means \"occurring\ntogether.\"\n\nSystem showing incongruent melting\n\nIn this system, enstatite melts incongruently to forsterite and liquid. This type of melting\nreaction is called a peritectic reatction. Peritectic means \"built around\".\n\nA peritectic is not a point terminal to the coexistence of liquid and crystals. Instead, one\nof the solids disappears. This type of reaction is also referred to as a discontinuous\nreaction, because one of the solid phases reacts out.\n\nSystem showing continuous solid solution\n\nA continuous change in compositions of crystal and coexisting liquid occurs with\ndecreasing temperature.\n\nMore on 2 component Systems\n\nSolution exhibiting critical behavior - solvus\nMiscibility gaps\n\nSeveral mineral solutions exhibit this behavior -\n\nAlkali feldspars\nKAlSi3O8 - NaAlSi3O8\nOrthoclase - Albite\n\nPyroxenes\n\nMgSiO3 - FeSiO3 - CaSiO3\n\nFeldspathoids\nKAlSiO4 - NaAlSiO4\n\nKalsilite - Nepheline\n\nMethods of Melting\n\nBatch melting - an equilibrium process - a bulk composition is raised to a specific\ntemperature above its solidus, the system comes to equilibrium, and the melt is removed.\n\nFractional fusion - the opposite of fractional crystallization - melt is removed from\ncontact with solid residue as it is produced.\n\nContinuous melting with incomplete melt withdrawal - in this case, melt is generated by\npartial melting, then some of the melt is removed, but some is left in contact with the\nsolid residue.\n\nIn both the fractional fusion and continuous melting with incomplete melt withdrawal\ncases, the composition of the residue changes continuously as melt is withdrawn.\n\nFractional Crystallization\n\nTypes of fractional crystallization\n\nPerfect fractionation - Crystals are removed from contact with melt as soon as they are\nformed.\n\nOvergrowth zoning fractionation - Crystal grows from melt and overgrown rims on\ncrystals remove the interior of the crystal from reaction with the melt. The extent to\nwhich this process can occur will be governed by diffusion rates in the crystal, because\nthese rates are generally much slower than diffusion in the liquid.\n\nIn contrast, during equilibrium crystallization, crystals and liquid continually react.\n\nSome examples - In ex. 1, composition A (under equilibrium conditions) crystallizes\ncompletely to Fo and En at the reaction point. All liquid is used up in reacting Fo + liq\nÆ En. Under conditions of fractionation, liquid can each the En + Trid eutectic.\n\nIn ex. 2 (under equilibrium conditions), composition A crystallizes initial feldspar B. The\nplagioclase and the liquid change composition continually as temperature drops until the\nliquid reaches C and the feldspar reaches A. Here all liquid is used up and we are left\nwith a homogenous solid with composition A.\n\nFor fractionation, feldspar is removed from contact with liquid and zoning develops.

      "content": "Sediments and Sedimentary Rocks\n\nSedimentary rocks accumulate from the operation of surface properties over time. The\ncrust comprises only the outer 0.3% of the radius of the earth, and sedimentary rocks\nmake up a relatively minor proportion of the crust. Nevertheless, sediments cover more\nthan 80% of the Earth's surface and they record important information on surface\nconditions and processes over Earth history. Information about climate, sea level rise and\nfall, chemistry of the oceans, tectonics, meteorite impacts, etc. are preserved in\nsediments.\n\nSedimentary processes are also responsible for the redistribution of chemical elements\nover the Earth's surface, and the chemical differentiation associated with weathering and\nsedimentation provides a basis for sedimentary rock classification.\n\nPrinciple Sedimentary Rock Types\n\nSedimentary rocks can be grouped very broadly into two categories: siliciclastic rocks\nand carbonates + evaporates (chemical precipitates). Siliciclastics rocks are residues of\nthe weathering process (just like peridotites are residues of mantle melting processes) and\ncarbonates + evaporates are precipitates from aqueous solution (you can think of the\nocean as a huge aqueous lava lake undergoing fractional crystallization...).\n\nSiliciclastics\n\nSiliciclastic rocks are classified based on the sizes of their constituent particles (clasts):\n\nConglomerate\n>5 mm\nSandstone\n\n1/16-2mm\nShale\n\n<1/16 mm\n\nConglomerates are composed of large rock fragments and make up a minor fraction of\nthe total sedimentary rock mass (<1% by weight).\n\nSandstones are composed primarily of quartz, feldspar, and rock fragments. They can be\nsubclassified in terms of \"sorting\" (basically, the width of the clast size distribution;\nnarrow size distribution = well-sorted) and the intensity of the chemical weathering to\nwhich they have been subjected.\n\nGraywackes are the least altered by chemical weathering and have bulk\ncompositions similar to their source rocks. They are not well sorted and contain\nabundant clay minerals. Graywackes are usually deposited relatively near their\nsource--they are characteristic of foreland basin deposits.\n\nLithic sandstones are composed primarily of lithic fragments (rock fragments)\nalong with quartz and feldspars. They are better sorted than graywackes and\nhence have less clay. Clay minerals are enriched in aluminum, and the chief\n\ncompositional difference between lithic sandstones and their source rocks is\ndepletion in Al.\n\nArkoses are composed primarily of quartz and feldspars. They have been\nsubjected to more intense weathering than lithic sandstones or graywackes, and\nmost of the mafic minerals are gone. Arkoses are enriched in K-feldspar relative\nto plagioclase because K-spar dissolves more slowly then plagioclase in water.\nFrom the pink K-spar and hematite left by the dissolved mafic minerals, arkosic\nsandstones are often known as \"red beds.\"\n\nQuartzites, also known as quartz arenites, are composed primarily of quartz,\nwhich is the most resistand to weathering of the major rock forming minerals.\nThey are products of intense weathering and are well sorted, which usually\nimplies that they have been transported far from their source.\n\nShales are composed primarily of clay minerals, along with some fine-grained quartz and\nfeldspar. Clay minerals are products of the incongruent dissolution of rock-forming\nminerals by aqueous solutions. For example, albite dissolves incongruently in water to\nform kaolinite [Al2Si2O5(OH)4]--an important clay mineral + solutes:\n\n2 NaAlSi3O8 +CO2 + 11H2O = Al2Si2O5(OH)4 + 2Na+ + 2HCO3\n- + 4H4SiO4(aq)\n\nOther important clay minerals are montmorillonite [(Al,Mg)8(Si4O10)4(OH)8*12H2O] and\nillite, a mica that has significant Ca and Mg substitution for K. Shales are enriched in Al,\nMg and K relative to their source rocks. They are the most abundant sedimentary rocks,\ncomposing ~70% of the entire sedimentary rock mass.\n\nCarbonates\n\nCarbonates (e.g. limestones) are composed primarily of the carbonate minerals calcite,\naragonite, and dolomite. Most calcite and aragonite (polymorphs, both with composition\nCaCO3) is precipitated from seawater by organisms. Dolomite (Ca,Mg)CO3 is a\nsecondary mineral that forms during diagenesis--after burial, calcite and aragonite react\nwith fluids and dolomite precipitates. The dolomite content of carbonate rocks increases\nsteadily with the age of the rock, and the oldest carbonate rocks have very little primary\ncalcite remaining.\n\nThe particles that compose carbonate sediments can be grouped into several categories:\n\nCarbonate mud - microcrystalline carbonate, usually less than 5μm in diameter.\nSome carbonate mud is formed by the mechanical or biological abrasion of larger\nparticles, but most is precipitated directly, either as aragonite crystals precipitated\ninorganically from seawater (whether this happens in nature is controversial) or as\naragonite needles produced within the tissues of calcareous algae.\n\nSkeletal particles - the whole and broken skeletons of invertebrates and\ncalcareous algae.\n\nOoids - subspherical sand-size carbonate particles that have concentric rings of\ncalcium carbonate surrounding a nucleus of another particle. The usually form in\na tidal setting--the surfaces of rolling grains on the bottom provide heterogeneous\nnucleation sites for the inorganic precipitation of aragonite.\n\nPeloids - small (30 to 100 μm in diameter) rounded aggregates of carbonate mud.\nMost of these are fecal pellets that have passed through the digestive systems of\nbottom-feeding marine organisms like polychaete worms, gastropods, and\ncrustaceans.\n\nCarbonates are deposited both in carbonate reefs, which are shallow-water, usually warm\nenvironments and in the deep seas as calcareous oozes, which are composed of the tests\n(shells) of planktonic microorganisms like foraminifera and coccoliths (coccolith tests are\nthe constituents of blackboard chalk).\n\nCarbonate accumulates on the ocean floor only above a certain depth, called the\ncarbonate compensation depth (CCD). The solubility of calcite and aragonite increase\nwith depth, and below the CCD all carbonate minerals are dissolved. We can rationalize\nthe increasing solubility of carbonate minerals with depth by examining the calcite\ndissolution reaction:\n\nCaCO3 + CO2(aq) + H2O = Ca2\n+\n(aq) + 2HCO3\n-\n(aq)\n\nThe solubility of CO2 in water increases with pressure and increasing concentration of\nCO2(aq) causes the reaction to proceed to the right. In modern oceans the CCD varies\nbetween 4 and 7 km depth, depending mostly on the rate of calcite and aragonite\nproduction in surface waters (higher carbonate production increases the depth of the\nCCD).\n\nEvaporites\n\nEvaporites are inorganic precipitates from aqueous solutions, composed primarily of the\nminerals anhydrite (CaSO4), gypsum (CaSO4*2H2O) and halite (NaCl). They are\ndeposited mainly in arms of the sea that have limited communication with the open\nocean. The bottom of the Mediterranean Sea, for example, is draped by a thick sequence\nof evaporites. Evaporite minerals become saturated only in solutions that are\nconsiderably more concentrated than the water in the open ocean. Gypsum is the first\nmineral to saturate from evaporating seawater--it crystallizes from solutions ~3X as\nconcentrated as seawater. Halite is saturated in solutions ~10X the concentration of\nseawater."

In\naddition, the following magmatic processes are important:\n\nMagma mixing - natural consequence of periodicity or episodicity of volcanic/plutonic\neruptions, usually mixing between magmas in different stages of evolution by fractional\ncrystallization\n\nAssimilation of wall rock - heat up and melt rock in close proximity to magma. This\nrequires a LOT of heat, so the periodic recharge of magma is important\n\nEx. Imagine a crustal intrusion of basalt, geotherm 30oC/km. At 6 km depth, 200oC\ngranite wall rock (melts at 900oC). Intrude basalt at 1200oC. To heat the country rock\nand melt it cools the basalt. The specific heat of the granite is about .3 cal/gram/oC, and\nthe latent heat of fusion is about 100 cal/gramÆrequires 310 cal/gram to melt from\n200oC. Basalt cools and crystallizes at solidus 1000oC. With similar specific heat and\nlatent heat of fusion, the basalt will lose only 160 cal/gram of heat before it solidifies. If\nthe basalt is solidified before the granite is melted, the melts can't mix.\nBUT if magmas continue to intrude, there will be enough heat to mix melts.\n\nSoret diffusion - temperature gradient effect (non-equilibrium process), elements\nrearrange to minimize entropy production. Rates of diffusion are slow relative to heat\ntransfer rate, by about an order of 5.\n\nMetasomatize - to change composition in the solid state, usually by fluid exchange with\nrock\n\nGranites\nIgneous processes, phase equilibrium evidence (1958)... see handout.\nThe old granite problem has been solved.\n\nNew problem - granite batholiths (with granidiorites and diorites) - how could a large\nscale batholith form by fractional crystallization from a basalt parent? There is no\nevidence for other crystals underneath the batholiths. Where are the accumulated\nproducts of fractional crystallization?\n\nTuttle and Bowen showed that granites are best visualized as products of fractional\ncrystallization. They plotted the compositions of natural granites to show that ONLY\nfractional crystallization after H2O saturated melting could explain granites--the\ncompositions are all nearly the same. He explained this with the phase diagram of the\ngranite system, which has a ternary minimum.\nIf there is a ternary minimum...\n\n--the first melt composition depends on bulk composition\n--you cannot make liquids of similar composition by melting solids with different\ncompositions\n--you can make solids with composition at the ternary minimum by taking\ncompositionally variable materials and allowing fractional crystallization to occur\n\nHowever, Bowen didn't know that at higher pressures, the phase diagram for granite has\na eutectic, not a minimum."

      "content": "6.436/15.085, Fall 2005.\nBackground\n1.1 SETS\nA set is a collection of objects, which are the elements of the set. If A is\na set and x is an element of A, we write x ⊇ A. If x is not an element of A, we\nwrite x /\n. A set can have no elements, in which case it is called the empty\n⊇ A\nset, denoted by Ø.\nSets can be specified in a variety of ways. If A contains a finite number of\nelements, say x1, x2, . . . , xn, we write it as a list of the elements, in braces:\nA = {x1, x2, . . . , xn}.\nFor example, the set of possible outcomes of a die roll is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, and the\nset of possible outcomes of a coin toss is {H, T}, where H stands for \"heads\"\nand T stands for \"tails.\"\nMore generally, we can consider the set of all x that have a certain property\nP, and denote it by\nx satisfies P}.\n{x |\nVersion of 9/6/05\n\n6.436/15.085, Fall 2005. Background\nChap. 1\n(The symbol \" \" is to be read as \"such that.\") For example, the set of even\n|\nintegers can be written as {k k/2 is integral}. Similarly, the set of all real\n|\nnumbers x in the interval [0, 1] can be written as {x 0 · x · 1}.\n|\nIf A contains infinitely many elements x1, x2, . . ., that can be enumerated in\na list (so that the elements are in a one-to-one correspondence with the positive\nintegers), we write\nA = {x1, x2, . . .},\nand we say that A is countably infinite. For example, the set of even inte\ngers can be written as {0, 2, -2, 4, -4, . . .}, and is countably infinite. The term\ncountable is sometimes used to refer to a set which is either finite or countably\ninfinite. A set which is not countable is said to be uncountable.\nIf every element of a set A is also an element of a set B, we say that A is\na subset of T, and we write A ∪ B or B inf A.+ If A ∪ B and A ∪ B, the two\nsets are equal, and we write A = B. It is sometimes expedient to introduce a\nuniversal set, denoted by , which contains all objects that could conceivably\nbe of interest in a particular context. Having specified a context in terms of a\nuniversal set , one then only considers sets A that are subsets of .\n1.2 SET OPERATIONS\nThe complement of a set A, with respect to a universal set , is the set\nx /⊇ A} of all elements of that do not belong to A, and is denoted by\n{x ⊇\nc\n|\nA . Note that c = Ø.\nThe union of two sets A and B is the set of all elements that belong to A\nor B (or both), and is denoted by A≥ B. The intersection of two sets A and B\nis the set of all elements that belong to both A and B, and is denoted by A ≤ B.\nThus,\nA ≥ B = {x x ⊇ A or x ⊇ B},\n|\nand\nA ≤ B = {x x ⊇ A and x ⊇ B}.\n|\nWe will often deal with the union or the intersection of several, even in\nfinitely many sets, defined in the obvious way. In particular, if I is a (possibly\ninfinite) index set, and for each i ⊇ I we have a set Ai, the union of these sets is\ndefined as\n[\nAi = {x x ⊇ Si for some i ⊇ I},\n|\ni2I\n+ In some texts, the notation A ∩ B is used to indicate that A is a subset\nof B, whereas in other texts, A ∩ B indicates that A is a proper subset of B,\nthat is, A ∪ B and A = B.\n⊆\n\nSec. 1.3\nNotation: Some common sets\nand their intersection is defined as\n\nSi = x x ⊇Si for all i ⊇I}.\n{ |\ni2I\nIn case we are dealing with the union or intersection of countably many sets Sn,\nthe notation ≥1 Sn and ≥1 Sn, respectively, is used.\nn=1\nn=1\nTwo sets are said to be disjoint if their intersection is empty. More gen\nerally, several sets are said to be disjoint if no two of them have a common\nelement. A collection of sets is said to be a partition of a set A if the sets in\nthe collection are disjoint and their union is A.\nThe Algebra of Sets\nSet operations have several properties, which are elementary consequences of the\ndefinitions. Some examples are:\nA ≥B = B ≥A,\nA ≤(B ≥C) = (A ≤B) ≥(A ≤C),\n(Ac)c = A,\nA ≥ = ,\nA ≥(B ≥C) = (A ≥B) ≥C,\nA ≥(B ≤C) = (A ≥B) ≤(A ≥C),\nA ≤Ac = Ø,\nA ≤ = A.\nTwo particularly useful properties are given by De Morgan's laws which\nstate that\n!c\nA\n!c\nA[\nAi\n=\n\nAc\ni ,\n\nAi\n=\n[\nAc\ni .\ni2I\ni2I\ni2I\ni2I\nTo establish the first law, suppose that x ⊇(≥i2I Ai)c . Then, x /\ni2I Ai, which\n⊇≥\nimplies that for every i ⊇I, we have x /⊇Ai. Thus, x belongs to the complement\nof every Ai, and x ⊇≤i2I Ac\ni . This shows that (≥i2I Ai)c\ni2I Ai\nc . The reverse\n∪≤\ninclusion is established by reversing the above argument, and the first law follows.\nThe argument for the second law is similar.\n1.3 NOTATION: SOME COMMON SETS\nWe now take introduce the notation that will be used to refer to some common\nsets:\n(a) ⊂ denotes the set of all real numbers;\n(b) ⊂ denotes ⊂≥{-→, →}, the set of extended real numbers.\n(c) Z denotes the set of all integers;\n(d) N denotes the set of natural numbers (the positive integers).\nAlso, for any a, b ⊇⊂, we use the following notation:\n\n6.436/15.085, Fall 2005. Background\nChap. 1\n(a) [a, b] denotes the set {\na · x · b};\nx ⊇⊂|\n(b) (a, b) denotes the set {\na < x < b};\nx ⊇⊂|\n(c) [a, b) denotes the set {\na · x < b};\nx ⊇⊂|\n(d) (a, b] denotes the set {\na < x · b}.\nx ⊇⊂|\nOur last set of definitions follows.\n(a) The Cartesian product of n sets A1, . . . , An, denoted by A1 × A2 × · · · ×\nAn, or Qn\ni=1 Ai for short, is the set of all n-tuples that can be formed by\npicking one element from each set, that is,\nn\nY\nAi = {(a1, . . . , an) ai ⊇Ai, 8 i}.\n|\ni=1\nThe set A × A is also denoted by A2 . The notation An is defined similarly.\n(b) The Cartesian product Q1 Ai of an infinite sequence of sets Ai is defined\ni=1\nas the set of all sequences (a1, a2, . . .) where ai ⊇Ai for each i. The simpler\nnotation A1 is used if Ai = A for all i.\n(c) The set of all subsets of a set A is denoted by 2A .\n(d) Given two sets A and B, AB stands for the set of functions from B to A.\nAs defined above, a sequence (a1, a2, . . .) of elements of a set A belongs to\nA1. However, such a sequence can also be viewed as a function from N into A,\nwhich belongs to AN . Thus, there is a one-to-one correspondence between A1\nand AN .\nIn the special case where A = {0, 1}, a sequence (a1, a2, . . .) can be iden\ntified with a subset of N, namely the set {\nan = 1}. We conclude that\nn ⊇N |\nthere is a one-to-one correspondence between {0, 1}1, {0, 1}N and 2N .\n1.4 SOME PROPERTIES OF SETS\nWe collect here some useful properties.\n\nSec. 1.4\nSome properties of sets\nA\nn\nA\nn .\n{0, 1}1\nA\nA\n⊂\nTheorem 1.\n(a) The union of countably many countable sets is a countable set.\n(b) If\nis finite, of cardinality , then 2\nhas cardinality 2\n(c) The Cartesian product of finitely many countable sets is countable.\n(d) The set of rational numbers is countable.\n(e) The set\nis uncountable.\n(f) The Cartesian product of infinitely many sets (with at least two ele\nments each) is uncountable.\n(g) If\nis infinite, then 2\nis uncountable.\n(h) An interval of real numbers of the form [a, b], with a < b, is uncount\nable, and the same is true for the set\nof real numbers.\nProof:\n(a) Left as an exercise.\n(b) When choosing a subset of A, there are two choices for each element of A:\nwhether to include it in the subset or not. Since there are n elements, with\ntwo choices for each, the total number of choices is 2n .\n(c) Suppose that A and B are countable sets, and that A =\na1, a2, . . .},\n{\nB = {b1, b2, . . .}. We observe that\nA × B =\n[ ¡\n{ai} × B\n¢\n.\ni=1\nFor any i, there is a one-to-one correspondence between elements of B and\nelements of {\nTherefore {ai} × B is countable. Using part (i) of\nai} × B.\nthe theorem, it follows that A × B is countable.\nWe continue by induction. We fix some k ∀2 and use the induction hypoth\nesis that the Cartesian product of k or fewer countable sets is countable.\nSuppose that the sets A1, . . . , Ak+1 are countable. We observe that the set\nA1 × · · · × Ak+1 is essentially the same as the set (A1 × · · · × Ak) × Ak+1,\nwhich is a Cartesian product of two sets. The first is countable, by the\ninduction hypothesis; the second is countable by assumption. The result\nfollows.\n(d) Left as an exercise.\n(e) Suppose, in order to derive a contradiction, that the elements of {0, 1}1\n(each of which is a binary sequences) can be arranged in a sequence s1, s2, . . ..\nConsider the binary sequence s whose kth entry is chosen to be different\n\n6.436/15.085, Fall 2005. Background\nChap. 1\nfrom the kth entry of the sequence sk . This sequence s is certainly an\nelement of {0, 1}1 but is different from each of the sequences sk , by con\nstruction. This means that the sequence s1, s2, . . . cannot exhaust all of\nthe elements of {0, 1}1 and therefore the latter set is uncountable.\n(f) Follows from (e).\n(g) Follows from (e) since 2A has at least as many elements as 2N , which can\nbe identified with {0, 1}1.\n(h) Consider the set of sequences (a1, a2, . . .) with values in {0, 1}. This set\nis uncountable by part (v). To any sequence, we associate the number\nP1\n. Note that every sequence results in a different number. It\ni=1 ai3-i\nfollows that the set of numbers of this form is also uncountable. This set\nof numbers is contained in [0, 1]; hence [0, 1] is uncountable. Any interval\n[a, b] has a one-to-one correspondence with the interval [0, 1] and is also\nuncountable.\nLet us take the idea in the proof of part (h) one step further. Let a =\n(a1, a2, . . .) be a binary sequence (with elements in {0, 1}). To any sequence a,\nwe associate the real number\n1 ai\nf(a) =\nX\n.\n2i\ni=1\nGiven that every real number on the interval [0, 1] can be expressed in binary, it\nfollows that f maps {0, 1}1 onto [0, 1]. This mapping is not one-to-one because,\nfor example, the sequences (0, 1, 1, . . .) and (1, 0, 0, . . .) map to the same number;\nthat is, the real number 1/2 has two different binary expansions. It can be verified\nthat this phenomenon occurs whenever we have a binary sequence that ends with\nan infinite string of ones, and only then. It follows that there is a one-to-one\ncorrespondence between the set [0, 1) and the set of sequences that do not end\nwith an infinite string of ones. Furthermore, it can be checked that the set of\nexcluded sequences is countable. We have therefore established a one-to-one\ncorrespondence between the set [0, 1) and a set of binary sequences (namely, the\nset of all binary sequences except for the excluded ones). This correspondence\nturns out to be useful in linking together some seemingly different probabilistic\nmodels.\nNotice that in the proof of part (h) we used 3i instead of 2i. By doing so,\nwe avoided the difficulty of multiple expansions of the same number, but on the\nother hand the numbers so constructed do not cover the interval [0, 1).\n1.5 SEQUENCES AND LIMITS\nFormally, a sequence of elements of a set A is a mapping f : N ! A. Let\nai = f(i). The corresponding sequence is often written as (a1, a2, . . .) or {ak }\nfor short.\n\nSec. 1.5\nSequences and Limits\nGiven a sequence {ak } and an increasing sequence of real numbers {ki},\nwe can construct a new sequence whose ith element is aki . This new sequence\nis called a subsequence of {ak}. Informally, a subsequence of {ak } is obtained\nby skipping some of the elements of the original sequence.\nDefinition\n(a) A sequence {xk} of real numbers (also called a \"real sequence\") is said to\nconverge to a real number x if for every 2 > 0 there exists some (positive\ninteger) K such that xk - x < 2 for every k ∀ K.\n|\n|\n(b) A real sequence {xk} is said to converge to → (respectively, -→) if for\nevery real number c there exists some K such that xk ∀ c (respectively,\nxk · c) for all k ∀ K.\n(c) If a real sequence converges to some x (possibly infinite), we say that x is\nthe limit of xk ; symbolically, limk!1 xk = x.\n(d) A real sequence {xk } is called a Cauchy sequence if for every 2 > 0, there\nexists some K such that xk - xm < 2 for all k ∀ K and m ∀ K.\n|\n|\n(e) A real sequence {xk} is said to be bounded above (respectively, below)\nif there exists some real number c such that xk · c (respectively, xk ∀ A)\nfor all k.\n(f) A real sequence {xk} is called bounded if the sequence {|xk } is bounded\n|\nabove.\n(g) A real sequence is said to be nonincreasing (respectively, nondecreas\ning) if xk+1 · xk (respectively, xk+1\nk) for all k. A sequence that is\n∀ x\neither nonincreasing or nondecreasing is called monotonic.\nThe following result is a fundamental property of the real-number system,\nand is presented without proof.\nTheorem 2. Every monotonic real sequence converges to an extended real\nnumber. If the sequence is also bounded, then it converges to a real number.\nDefinition\n(a) The supremum (or least upper bound) of a set A of real numbers,\ndenoted by sup A, is defined as the smallest extended real number x such\nthat x ∀ y for all y ⊇ A.\n(b) The infimum (or greatest lower bound) of a set A of real numbers,\ndenoted by inf A, is defined as the largest extended real number x such\nthat x · y for all y ⊇ A.\n(c) Given a sequence {xk } of real numbers, the supremum of the sequence,\ndenoted by supk xk , is defined as sup{xk k = 1, 2, . . .}. The infimum of a\n|\n\n6.436/15.085, Fall 2005.

Similarly, if\nit has arbitrarily small elements (that is, no finite lower bound), then the\ninfimum is equal to -→.\n(b) A strict application of the definitions shows that sup Ø = -→ and inf Ø =\n→. On the other hand, if a set is nonempty, then inf A · sup A.\n(c) The infimum or supremum of a set need not be an element of a set. For\nexample, the infimum of the set {1/k k ⊇ N} = 0.\n|\n(d) A sequence need not have a limit (e.g., consider the sequence xn = (-1)n.\nOn the other hand, the upper and lower limits of a real sequence are\nalways defined. To see this, let ym = sup{xk\n. The sequence\nk ∀ m}\n|\n{ym} is nonicreasing and therefore has a (possibly infinite) limit. We have\nlim supm!1 xk = limm!1 ym, and the latter limit is guaranteed to exist,\nby Theorem 2. A similar argument applies to the lower limit.\nLet {xk}\ninf\nk xk ·\nk!1 xk ·\nk!1\nxk · sup\nk\nxk.\n{xk}\nk!1 xk =\nk!1 xk\nxk .\nTheorem 3.\nbe a real sequence.\n(a) There holds\nlim inf\nlim sup\n(b) The sequence\nconverges (to an extended real number) if and only\nif lim inf\nlim sup\nand, in that case, both of these\nquantities are equal to the limit of\n1.5.1\nConvergence of vectors\nThe next definition refers to convergence of finite-dimensional real vectors.\nDefinition\nn\n(a) A sequence {xk} of vectors in ⊂\nis said to converge to some x ⊇ ⊂n if the\nith coordinate of xk converges to the ith coordinate of x, for every i.

There are various\nways of defining what it means for the sequence to converge to some limiting set.\nThe definitions that will be most useful for our purposes are given below.\nDefinition\n(a) We define lim supn!1 An as the set of all elements ! that belong to in\nfinitely many of the sets An. Formally,\nlim sup An =\n\n[\nAn\n\n.\nk=1\nn=k\nn!1\n(b) We define lim infn!1 An as the set of all ! that belong to all but finitely\nmany of the sets An.

A or\nlimn!1 An = A) if A = lim infn!1 An = lim supn!1 An.\nNote that a sequence of sets An need not have a limit, but lim supn!1 An\nand lim infn!1 An are always well defined.\nIn order to parse the formal definition above, note that ! ⊇≥1\nAn if and\nn=k\nonly if there exists some n ∀k such that ! ⊇An.

For each i, let ai be the probability that the process\neventually enters R, given that it starts at i. Then, the ai are the unique solution\nto the system of equations\n⎧\n⎨ 1,\ni ∈R,\nai =\n0,\ni recurrent, i /\n,\n⎩P\nj pijaj,\ni transient.\n∈R\nSee [BT, problem 29] for a proof of uniqueness.\nExpected time to absorption\nLet μi be the expected time until the process enters a recurrent state, starting\nfrom state i. Then, the μi are the unique solution to the system of equations\n0,\ni recurrent, .\nμi =\n1 + P\nj pijμj,\ni transient\nFirst passage times\nSuppose there is a single recurrent class and that s is a recurrent state. Let ti\nbe the expected time until the state first becomes s, starting from state i. Then,\nthe ti are the unique solution to the system of equations\n0,\nP\nif i = s,\nti =\n1 +\nj pijtj,\ni = s.\nMean recurrence time\nLet s be a recurrent state. Let t∗\ns be the mean time between successive visits to\nthe state s. Then,\nX\nt∗\ns = 1 +\npsjtj.\nj\n\nX\nSteadystate behavior\nTheorem:\n(a) There exists a nonnegative vector π such that\nX\nX\nπj =\nπkpkj,\n∀j,\nπi = 1.\n(1)\nk\ni\n(We call such a vector π, an invariant distribution.)\n(b) One particular invariant distribution can be constructed as follows. Let\nR be a recurrent class and fix some state s ∈ R. Let πi = 0 for i /∈ R. For\ni ∈ R, let\nE[# of transitions into i in a cycle that starts and ends at s]\nπi =\nE[# of transitions in a cycle that starts and ends at s]\n.\n(In particular, πs = 1/t∗, where t∗ is the mean recurrence time of state\ns\ns\ns.)\n(c) If π is an invariant distribution and i is a transient state, then πi = 0.\n(d) If there is a single recurrent class, then\nn\nlim\nrij(t) = πj,\n∀ i, j.\nn\nn→inf\nt=1\n(e) If there is a single recurrent class, which is aperiodic, then\nlim rij(n) = πj,\n∀i, j.\nn→inf\n(f) There exists only one invariant distribution if and only if there is a single\nrecurrent class.\n(g) There exists only one solution to the system (1) if and only if there is a\nsingle recurrent class.\n\nProof pointers.\n(a) Use Brouwer's fixed point theorem: if S ⊆<n is closed, bounded, and\nconvex, and f : S →S is continuous, there exists some x ∈S such that\nf(x) = x. Apply this to the map πT 7→πT P, with S being the set of all\nnonnegative vectors whose components sum to 1.\n(b) See [BT, Problem 32].\n(c) If P(X0 = i) = πi for all i, then P(Xn = i) = πi for all i. But for transient\nstates i, the latter probability goes to zero.\n(d) Omitted.\n(e) The coupling argument in [BT, Problem 17] shows that rij(n) -rkj(n) →\n0. Use this to show that maxn≥m(rij(n) -rij(m)) →0 as\n.\nm →inf\nThus rij(n) is a \"Cauchy sequence\", which guarantees that it converges\nto something. This limit must be the same for all i because of the previous\nfact.\n(f) See [BT, Problem 18].\n(g) Proof of the \"if\" part. Let π be a nonnegative solution (exists by part (a)\nand πi > 0 when i is recurrent, by part (c)). Let π be another solution.\nCheck that πi = 0 for i transient. If α is a large enough positive number,\nthen απ + π (normalized so that its components sum to 1) is a second\nnonnegative solution, contradicting part (f).\nThe \"only if\" part is an immediate consequence of part (f)."

      "content": "MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY\nFall 2005\n6.436J/15.085J\nNotes from the 9/12 lecture.\nIntroduction\nWe first establish that probability measures have a certain continuity property.\nWe then move to the construction of two basic probability models: (a) A\nmodel involving an infinite sequence of independent tosses of a fair coin; (b) A\nmodel in which the outcome is \"uniformly distributed\" over the unit interval\n[0, 1].\nThese two models are often encountered in elementary probability and used\nwithout further discussion. Rigorously speaking, however, one needs to be sure\nthat these models are wellposed and consistent with the axioms of probability.\nIn other words, one needs to establish that there exist probability spaces that\ncorrespond to these models.\nThe complete proof of the existence of such probability spaces requires quite\na bit of technical development (see [W]). In this handout, we go through the\nsteps of this development, omitting most of the proofs.\nContinuity of probabilities\nConsider a probability model in which Ω = <. We would like to be able to\nassert that the probability of the event [1/n, 1] converges to the probability of\nthe event (0, 1], as n →inf. This is accomplished by the following theorem.\nTheorem 1: Let F be a σfield of subsets (called \" Fmeasurable sets\") of a\nsample space Ω. Let P be a function on F such that P(Ω) = 1, P(A) ≥ 0\nfor every A ∈F, and such that P(A ∪B) = P(A) + P(B) whenever A, B are\ndisjoint elements of F. [This latter property of P is called \"finite additivity.\"]\nThe following are equivalent:\n(a) P is a probability measure (that is, it also satisfies countable additivity).\n(b) If Ai ∈ F is an increasing family of sets (Ai ⊆ Ai+1, for all i), and\nA = ∪inf\ni=1Ai, then limn→inf P(Ai) = P(A).\n(c) If Ai ∈F is a decreasing family of sets (Ai ⊇Ai+1, for all i), and A =\nAi, then limn→inf P(Ai) = P(A).\ni=1\n∩inf\n(d) If Ai ∈F is a decreasing family of sets (Ai ⊇Ai+1, for all i) and ∩infAi\ni=1\nis empty, then limn→inf P(Ai) = 0.\nProof: That (b) follows from (a) is Lemma 5 in [GS]. To establish (c) from (b),\njust use de Morgan's law. Statement (d) follows from (c) because it is just a\nspecial case in which A is empty. It remains to show that (d) implies (a).\n\nX\n\n!\n\n!\nP\nLet Bi ∈ F be disjoint events.\nLet An =\nBi.\nNote that An is a\ni=n\n∪inf\ndecreasing sequence of events and converges to the empty set. [Intuitively, any\nelement of A1 belongs to some Bn, which means that it does not belong to\nAn+1. So, every element of A1 is outside some An+1, so the intersection of the\nlatter sets is empty.]\nAssume that property (d) holds. Using finite additivity for the finitely many\n(n + 1) sets B1, B2, . . . , Bn, ∪inf\ni=n+1Bi, we have\nn\ninf\ninf\nP\nBi\n=\nP(Bi) + P\nBi\n.\ni=1\ni=1\ni=n+1\nThis equality holds for any n. Now let n → inf. The first term on the right\nhand side converges to\ninfP(Bi). The second term converges to zero, because\ni=1\nAn = ∪inf\nBi converges to the empty set and statement (d) applies. q.e.d.\ni=n+1\nThis theorem tells us that when checking for countable additivity, it is\nenough to check that P behaves \"continuously\" along a decreasing sequence\nof events with empty intersection.\nThe infinite coin toss model\nConsider an infinite sequence of fair coin tosses, with each toss being equally\nlikely to result in heads or tails (recorded as 1 and 0, respectively).\nThe\nsample space for this experiment is the set {0, 1}inf of all infinite sequences\nω = (ω1, ω2, . . .) of zeroes and ones.\nLet Fn be the set of events whose occurrence can be decided by looking at\nthe results of the first n tosses. For example, the event {ω\nω1 = 1 and ω2 = ω4}\n|\nn .\nbelongs to F4 (as well as to Fk for every k ≥4). Let A be a subset of {0, 1}\nConsider the event\n(ω1, ω2, . . . , ωn) ∈A}.\n{ω ∈{0, 1}inf |\nThis event belongs to Fn and all elements of Fn are of this form, for some A.\nLet An = {ω\nωn = 1}. The event A = ∪infAn is the event that there is at\ni=1\n|\nleast one \"1\" in the infinite toss sequence. We would like to be able to assign a\nprobability to the event A. Note that An ∈Fn for all n, but A does not belong\nto Fn for any n.\nWe define F0 =\ni=1Fi. So, an event B belongs to F0 if and only if it\n∪inf\nbelongs to Fn for some n. In particular, the event A above does not belong to\n0, even though A is the union of events in F0. Thus, F0 is not a σfield.\nF\nNote: The union ∪inf\ni=1Fi = F0 is not the same as the collection of sets of the\nform ∪infBi, for Bi ∈ Fi. For example, the set A discussed earlier is of the\ni=1\nlatter form but is not in F0. For a more concrete example, if F1 =\n, {b, c}}\n{{a}\nand F2 = {{d}}, then F\n2 =\n, {b, c}, {d}}, so that {b, c, d} is not in\n1 ∪F\n{{a}\n2.\nF1 ∪F\n\nP\nWe would like to have a probability model that assigns probabilities to all of the\nevents in the collections Fn. This means that we need a σfield that includes\nF0. But we would like to keep our σfield as small as possible. (If it is too large,\nwe may run into trouble when trying to assign a legitimate probability to all of\nthe events in the field.) This is accomplished next.\nThe σfield generated by a collection of sets.\nTheorem 2: Given a collection C of subsets of Ω, there exists a σfield F\n[also denoted σ(C) and called the σfield generated by C] which is the smallest\npossible σfield that includes all elements of C. [That is, if G is any other σfield\nand C ⊆G, then F ⊆G.]\nProof: Consider all σfields G that contain C. [There is at least one such G,\nnamely, the set of all subsets of Ω.] Let F be the intersection of all such G.\n[That is, a subset A of Ω belongs to F if and only if it belongs to every σfield\nG such that C ⊆G.]\nWe first verify that F is indeed a σfield. Fix any σfield G that includes all\nof C. If A1, A2, . . . ∈F, then Ai ∈G, for all i. Since G is a σfield, it follows that\nc\nAi ∈G and that ∪inf\n. Since such complements and unions belong to\ni=1Ai ∈G\nevery σfield G that includes the elements of C, it follows that such complements\nand unions are also in F, as required. Thus F is indeed a σfield.\nIf H is any other σfield that contains C, then by definition F ⊆H (since\nF was defined as the intersection of various σfields, one of which is just H).\nq.e.d.\nThe extension theorem\nTheorem 3: Suppose that F0 is a field. [That is, ∅∈F0. And if A, B ∈F0,\nc\nthen A\n0 and A ∪B ∈F0. A field is not necessarily a σfield, as it is not\n∈F\nclosed under countable unions.]\nSuppose that P0 is a mapping from F0 to [0, 1] with the following properties:\n(i) P0(Ω) = 1 and (ii) if Ai ∈F0 are disjoint sets such that ∪inf\n0, then\ni=1Ai ∈F\nP0(∪inf\n=\ninfP0(Ai). [In other words P0 satisfies all the axioms required\ni=1Ai)\ni=1\nof probability measures, but is just defined on sets A in F0.]\nThen, there exists a unique probability measure P on (Ω, σ(F0)), which is\nconsistent with P0 on F0 [that is, P(A) = P0(A) for every\n0].\nA ∈F\nRemark 1: The general scheme is that we start with a collection F0 of \"in\nteresting\" sets for which probabilities are defined. We extend F0 to make it a\nσfield, which is required in order to have a legitimate probability space. And\nwe then assign probabilities to every event in the σfield, in a manner which is\nconsistent with the probabilities for events in F0. The theorem states that (un\nder the stated assumptions on F0 -- it is a field -- and on P0 -- it is countably\nadditive on F0), this is can be done, and it can be done in a unique way.\n\nRemark 2: The proof of the extension theorem is long and involved.\nRenark 3: To apply the theorem one needs to verify countable additivity of\nP0 on F0. Alternatively, in the spirit if Theorem 1, one need only check that\nP0 is finitely additive, and that if Ai is a decreasing sequence of sets in F0 that\nconverges to the empty set, then P(Ai) converges to zero.\nBack to the coin tossing model\nRecall that F0 was defined to be ∪inf\nn=1Fn. Thus, a set A is in F0 if and only\nif there is some n such that the occurrence of the event can be decided on the\nbasis of the first n flips. It is easily checked that F0 is a field. [Indeed, if A ∈F0,\nc\nthen A ∈Fn for some n, and then A ∈Fn for that same n, which implies that\nc\nA\n0. Furthermore, if A, B ∈F0, there is some m and n such that A ∈Fm\n∈F\nand B ∈Fn. This implies that A ∪B ∈Fmax{m,n} ⊂F0.]\nIf A ∈F0, then A is an event whose occurrence can be decided by the first\nn coin tosses, for some n. We let every ntoss sequence be equally likely (with\nprobability 1/2n). It can be verified that this leads to a welldefined probability\nP0(A) for every A ∈F0. [Verifying this fact involves the following: If a set A\nbelongs to Fm and also to Fn, the probability P0(A) is defined in terms of the\nmodel that lets all ntoss sequences be equally likely, but also in terms of the\nmodel that lets all mtoss sequences be equally likely. Thus, we have to check\nthat these alternative definitions are consistent, tht is, lead to the same value\nfor P0(A).] It can be checked (though it is not trivial) that P0 is countably\nadditive on F0.\nThen, the extension theorem implies that there is a welldefined probability\nspace that agrees with the elementary coin tossing probabilities P0(A) for events\nA that relate to a finite number of tosses. It confirms that the intuitive process of\nan infinite sequence of coin flips can be captured rigorously within the framework\nof probability theory.\nThe uniform distribution on the unit interval\nAs with the coin tossing model, we now wish to define a uniform probability\ndistribution on the unit interval. For simplicity of exposition, we consider the\ninterval (0, 1] (that is, the left endpoint is missing). The uniform probability\ndistribution is meant to correspond to P(A) = length(A). For this, we need\na family of sets which is a σfield, and for which \"length\" can be welldefined.\nLength is of course welldefined for nice and simple sets like (1/4, 1/2] (its length\nis 1/4), but what about more complicated sets?\nLet F0 consist of all sets that are unions of finitely many intervals of the\nform (a, b]. Given a set of the form A = (a1, b1] ∪· · · ∪(an, bn], where 0 ≤a1 <\nn < bn ≤1 (which is the typical set in F0), we define\nb1 ≤a2 < b2 ≤· · · ≤ a\nP0(A) = (b1 -a1) + · · · + (bn -an) which is its total length.\nThe family F0 is a field. Indeed, for the set A above, its complement (in\n\nP\nX\n\n(0, 1]) is (b1, a2]∪· · ·∪(bn, 1] which is also in F0. And the union of two sets that\nare unions of finitely many intervals is also a union of finitely many intervals.\n(For example, if A = (1/8, 2/8] ∪(4/8, 7/8] and B = (3/8, 5/8], then A ∪B =\n(1/8, 2/8] ∪(3/8, 7/8].)\nIt turns out that P0 is countably additive on F0. This essentially boils down\nto checking the following. If (a, b] = ∪inf\ni=1(ai, bi], where the intervals (ai, bi] are\ninf\ndisjoint, then b -a =\ni=1(bi -ai). This may appear intuitively obvious, but\na formal proof is nontrivial.\nLet F = σ(F0), which is the smallest σfield containing F0. Sets in F are\ncalled Borel sets and F is called the Borel σfield.\nUsing the extension\ntheorem and the earlier assertions, it follows that there is a probability measure\nP which agrees with P0 for sets A that are in F0 (union of finitely many disjoint\nintervals). This probability measure is called the Lebesgue measure.\nBy augmenting the sample space Ω to include 0, and assigning zero prob\nability to it, we obtain a new probability model with sample space Ω = [0, 1].\n(Exercise: define formally the sigmafield on [0, 1], starting from the σfield on\n(0, 1]).\nAny set that can be formed by starting with intervals [a, b) using a countable\nnumber of settheoretic operations (taking complements of previously formed\nsets, or forming countable unions of previously formed sets) is a Borel set. For\nexample, singleelement sets {a} are Borel sets, and so is the set of rational\nnumbers in [0, 1). Furthermore, intervals [a, b] are also Borel since they are of\nthe form [a, b) ∪{b}, which is the union of two Borel sets. More generally, any\nset you may be able to construct will be a Borel set, as long as your construction\nis not \"exotic.\"\nHaving defined Lebesgue measure (\"length\") for Borel subsets of [0,1], it is\nstraightforward to define the Lebesgue measure μn for Borel subsets of [n, n+1].\nThis leads to a construction of Lebesgue measure on Borel subsets of the real\nline. (To define the Borel subsets, we consider the σfield generated by sets of\nthe form (a, b]. We then define μ, by letting\ninf\nμ(A) =\nμ A ∩(n, n + 1] ,\nA ∈F,\nn=-inf\nand verify that μ is indeed a measure (need to use the countable additivity of\nμn to establish the countable additivity of μ).\nCompletion of a probability space\nConsider a probability space (Ω, F, P). Suppose that A ⊆B, B ∈F, P(B) = 0.\n(Any set B with this property is called a null set. Note that in this context,\n\"null\" is not the same as \"empty.\") If the set A is not in F, it does not have\na probability assigned to it, but it would seem that one can safely assign zero\nprobability to it.\nThe first step is to augment our σfield so that it contains all the subsets\nof null sets. This is done by letting F∗ = σ(F ∪N), where N is the collection\n\nof all subsets of null sets, and then extending P in a natural manner to obtain\na new probability measure P∗ that applies to all sets in F ∗.\n[This is also\ndiscussed briefly in pp. 1415 of [GS].] The resulting probability space is said to\nbe complete. It has the property that all subsets of null sets are included in\nthe σfield and are also null sets.\nWhen this completion is carried out for the model of the preceding section\n(Ω = [0, 1), F =Borel sets, P=Lebesgue measure), we obtain a new probability\nspace with the same Ω, an augmented σfield F ∗, and a measure on (Ω, F ∗).\nThe sets in F ∗ are called Lebesgue measurable sets; the new measure still\nhas the same name (\"Lebesgue measure\").\nInteresting facts\n(a) There exist sets that are Lebesgue measurable but not Borel measurable,\nso in this context F is a proper subset of F ∗.\n(b) There are as many Borel measurable sets as there are points on the real\nline (this is the \"cardinality of the continuum\"), but there are as many\nLebesgue measurable sets as there are subsets of the real line (which is a\nhiger cardinality).\n(c) There exist subsets of (0, 1] that are not Lebesgue measurable. [W, pp.\n1415, 192].\n(d) It is not possible to construct a probability space in which the σfield\nincludes all subsets of (0, 1], with the property that P({x}) = 0 for every\nx ∈ (0, 1]. [B, pp. 4546]\nReferences\nEssentially all of this discussion (plus proofs and much more) is in [B]. Reference\n[W] (Chapters 1 and 2) is more concise and closer to our development.\nIt\nincludes most of the proofs (hard ones are in appendices). But the countable\nadditivity assertion for P0 in Section 5 of this handout is not in [W].\n[B] Billingsley, Probability and Measure.\n[W] Williams, Probability with Martingales."

      "content": "MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY\nFall 2005\n6.436J/15.085J\nNotes from the 9/26 lecture\nThe material in Sections 16 below serves two purposes: first, to introduce some notation and\nterminology, with which one should be familiar, and second, to provide a compendium of mostly\nelementary but commonly used facts. This material is also covered in Chapter 3 of [W]. A short\nsummary would be that a \"nice\" function of a set of random variables is a random variable, and the\nsame is true when one considers various kinds of limits of a sequence of random variables.\nBorel σfields\n- Recall that the σfield of Borel sets in (0, 1] (also known as the Borel σfield) is the σfield\ngenerated by the collection of all intervals of the form (a, b], where 0 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 1. We will use\nB to denote it.\n- A Borel σfield can also be defined when dealing with the entire real line, <. (It is denoted\nagain by B, by a slight abuse of notation.) This is the σfield generated by the collection of\nintervals of the form (a, b], but without any restrictions on a, b.\n- Sometimes, instead of dealing with the set < of real numbers, we may want to deal with the\nset < = [\n] of extended real numbers. The Borel σfield on < can be defined as the\n-inf, inf\nsmallest σfield that contains all Borel subsets of <, as well as the sets {-inf} and {inf}.\n- The σfield of Borel subsets of <k, denoted by Bk can be defined in several ways, which turn\nout to be equivalent:\n- It is the smallest σfield that contains all sets of the form {(x1, . . . , xk)\nx1 ≤ c1, . . . , xk ≤\nck}, where c1, . . . , ck can be any real numbers.\n|\n- It is the smallest σfield that contains all sets of the form A1 × A2 × · · · × Ak, where each\nAi is a Borel subset of <.\n- The second definition above is the one given in p. 15 of [GS]. But the first definition is sometimes\neasier to use.\n- The notation Bk is misleading. The set Bk is not the Cartesian product of k copies of B.\nk\n- Let λ1 be the Lebesgue measure on (<, B). We then define the Lebesgue measure λ on (< , Bk)\nas follows. If Ai ∈ B for each i, then we let λ(A1 × · · · × Ak) = λ1(A1)\nλ1(Ak). (This\n· · ·\ncorresponds to the elementary formula for the volume of a \"rectangle\"). We then use the\nextension theorem to obtain the measure λ(A) for any A ∈ B.\nMeasurable functions\n- Let (Ω, F) be a sample space together with a σfield of subsets of Ω. Such a pair is called a\nmeasurable space, and the elements of F are Fmeasurable sets. When F is clear from\nthe context, we just call them \"measurable sets.\" If we also have a probability measure on\n(Ω, F), then we have a probability space (Ω, F, P).\n- Definition of a random variable. Let X be a function from Ω to <, the set of real numbers.\nWe say that X is a random variable, or that X is Fmeasurable, if the set {ω\nX(ω) ≤ c}\nis Fmeasurable for every c ∈ <.\n|\nWe are sometimes interested in functions from Ω that can also take infinite values. In such\n-\ncases, we repeat the above definition but with (<, B) replaced by (<, B), and we say that X is\nan extendedvalued random variable.\n\nP\nX\n- Because the intervals of the form (-inf, c] \"generate\" the Borel σfield in <, it can be shown that\nif X is a random variable, then for any Borelmeasurable set B, the set X-1(B) = {ω\nX(ω) ∈\nB} is Fmeasurable set. Because of this, the probability P(X ∈B) = P({ω\nX(ω)\n|\n∈B}) is\nwelldefined, and is actually a probability measure on (<, B).\n|\n- A more elegant definition of a random variable. Because of the previous remark, we\nmight as well define a random variable as a function from Ω to < such that X-1(B) ∈F for\nevery B ∈B. Still, whenever we need to check this condition, we only need to check it for sets\nB of the special form B = (-inf, c].\n- The distribution function of a random variable X. The function F : < →[0, 1] defined\nby F(c) = P(X ≤c) is called the distribution function of X, or sometimes the cumulative\ndistribution function of X (CDF).\n- For every Borel subset B of the real line, we define PX(B) = P(X ∈B). [Note that P is a\nmeasure on (Ω, F), whereas PX is a measure on (<, B).] This probability measure is called\nthe probability law of X, or sometimes the distribution of X.\nFacts about measurability\n- If A is a subset of Ω, we define its indicator function IA : Ω →< by IA(ω) = 1 if ω ∈A,\nand IA(ω) = 0 if ω /∈A.\n- If A1, . . . , An are Fmeasurable sets, and λ1, . . . , λn are real numbers, the function X =\nn\nλiIAi , or in more detail,\ni=1\nn\nX(ω) =\nλiIAi(ω),\n∀ω ∈Ω,\ni=1\nis Fmeasurable, i.e., a random variable. Such a random variable is called a simple random\nvariable.\n- Let each fn be a function from Ω into <. Consider a new function f = infn fn defined by\nf(ω) = infn fn(ω) for every ω ∈ Ω. The functions supn fn, lim infn fn, and lim supn fn are\ndefined similarly. Note that even if the fn are everywhere finite, the above defined functions\nmay turn out to be extendedvalued.\n- Measurability of limits: If each fn is Fmeasurable, then infn fn, supn fn, lim infn fn, and\nlim supn fn are Fmeasurable (extendedvalued) functions. Furthermore, if limn→inf(fn(ω))\nexists for all ω, then the limit function f defined by f(ω) = limn→inf(fn(ω)) is also measurable.\nThis limit function is called the pointwise limit of the sequence of functions fn, because we\nconsider separately each different \"point\" ω and take the limit as n →infto obtain f(ω). For\nexample, suppose that ω ∈ [0, 1] and that fn(ω) = ωn . Then, the pointwise limit f exists,\nwith f(1) = 1 and f(ω) = 0 for ω ∈[0, 1).\n- According to the previous item, a pointwise limit of simple functions is measurable. It turns\nout that the converse is also true. Namely, every measurable function is the pointwise limit\nof simple functions. And every nonnegative measurable function is the pointwise limit of a\nnondecreasing sequence of simple functions (that is, fn(ω) ≤ fn+1(ω) for every n and ω).\nThese facts will be revisited when we study expected values of random variables.\n- A function g : < →< is called measurable if g-1(B) ∈B for every B ∈B. (The proper term\nwould be \"Borelmeasurable,\" but the Borel σfield is the default choice unless the contrary is\nstated).\n- Composition of measurable functions. If f : Ω →< is Fmeasurable, and g : < →< is\nmeasurable, then the composition g *f of these two functions, defined by (g *f)(ω) = g(f(ω)),\nis also Fmeasurable.\n\nX\nMeasurability and continuity\n- Continuity implies measurability. If f is a continuous function from < to <, then f is\nmeasurable.\n- Remark: We can define continuity of f by requiring that whenever xn →x, we must also have\nf(xn) →f(x). It turns out that this is equivalent to the following more abstract condition:\nfor every open subset U of <, the set f -1(U) is also open. Since every open subset of < is\nBorel (Homework 1), this discussion outlines a proof of the preceding claim, that continuity\nimplies measurability.\n- Since continuity implies measurability, and since the composition of measurable functions is\nmeasurable, we obtain the following. If X is a random variable and f is a continuous function\nfrom < into itself, then f(X) is also a random variable.\nMultiple random variables\n- If X and Y are random variables, then so are X + Y , XY , max{X, Y }.\n- If Y (ω) =6\n0 for every ω, then X/Y is also a random variable.\n- Generalizing the first fact of this section, the following is true.\nIf X1, . . . , Xn are random\nvariables and f is a continuous function from <n to <, then f(X1, . . . , Xn) is a random\nvariable.\nA more economical development\nMost of the above discussion and facts can be expressed in a more economical manner, as follows.\nThe statements below are crisper, but more abstract, and somewhat harder to parse.\nSuppose that we have three measurable spaces (Ω1, F1), (Ω2, F2), (Ω3, F3).\n- A function f : Ω1 →Ω2 is called F1/F2measurable if f -1(B) ∈F1 for every B ∈F2.\n- With this definition, if Ω2 = <, then a random variable is just a F1/Bmeasurable function.\n- The composition of a F1/F2measurable function and a F2/F3measurable function is F1/F3\nmeasurable.\n- If (Ω2, F2) = (<k , Bk), (Ω3, F3) = (<m , Bm), and g : Ω2 → Ω3 is continuous, then g is\n2/F3measurable.\nF\n- If X1, . . . , Xk are random variables, then the mapping f : Ω1 → <k defined by f(ω) =\n(X1(ω), . . . , Xk(ω)) is F1/Bkmeasurable.\n- By combining the last two facts, we recover the last fact of the previous section.\nThe Cantor set and a singular measure\n- Every number x ∈[0, 1] has a ternary expansion of the form\ninfxi\nx =\n3i ,\nwith xi ∈{0, 1, 2}.\n(1)\ni=1\nThis expansion is not unique. For example, 1/3 admits two expansions, namely .10000 · · · and\n.022222 · · ·. Nonuniqueness occurs only for those x that admit an expansion that ends with\nan infinite sequence of 2's. The set of such unusual x is countable, and therefore has Lebesgue\nmeasure zero.\n\nR\n- The Cantor set C is the set of all x that have a ternary expansion that uses only 0's and 2's\n(no 1's allowed). The set C is constructed as follows. Start with the interval [0, 1] and remove\nthe \"middle third\" (1/3, 2/3). Then, from each of the remaining closed intervals [0, 1/3] and\n[2/3, 1] remove their middle thirds, (1/9, 2/9) and (7/9, 8/9), resulting in four closed intervals,\nand continue similarly.\nNote that C is measurable, since it is constructed by removing a\ncountable sequence of intervals. Also, the length (Lebesgue measure) of C is 0, since at each\nstage its length is mutliplied by a factor of 2/3.\n- Consider an infinite sequence of rolls of a 3sided die, whose faces are labeled 0, 1, and 2.\nAssume that rolls are independent, and that at each roll each of the three possible results has\nprobability 1/3. If we use the sequence of these rolls to form a number x, then the probability\nlaw of the resulting random variable is the Lebesgue measure (i.e., picking a ternary expansion\n\"at random\" leads to a uniform random variable).\n- The Cantor set can be identified with those roll sequences in which a \"1\" never occurs. (These\nroll sequences have zero probability which is consistent with the fact that C has zero Lebesgue\nmeasure.)\n- The set C has the same cardinality as the set {0, 2}inf, which is uncountable.\n- Consider an infinite sequence of coin tosses. If the ith flip results in tails, record xi = 0; if it\nresults in heads, record xi = 2. Use the xi's to form a number x, using Eq. (1). This defines\na random variable X whose range is the set C. The probability law of this random variable is\ntherefore concentrated on the \"zerolength\" set C. At the same time P(X = x) = 0 for every\nx, because any particular sequence of heads and tails has zero probability.\nDecomposition of measures on (<, B)\n- A probability measure P on (<, B) is discrete if there is a countable set A ⊂< such that\nP(A) = 1.\n- A probability measure P has no point mass if P({x}) = 0 for every x.\n- A probability measure P on (<, B) is absolutely continuous if P(A) = 0 for every Borel set\nA that has Lebesgue measure zero.\n- It turns out that absolutely continuous probability laws admit a density f, i.e., there exists\na measurable function f so that P(X ≤c) =\nc\nf(x) dx, for every c. This is a deep and\n-inf\ndifficult result. Furthermore, it requires a proper definition of an integral, when the integrand\nis measurable but discontinuous.\n- A probability measure P on (<, B) is singular if there is a set A that has zero Lebesgue\nmeasure and such that P(A) = 1. (A discrete distribution is singular. The probability law in\nthe last item of the preceding section, which is concentrated on the Cantor set, is also singular.)\n- If P1, P2 are two probability measures on (<, B), and λ1, λ2 are nonnegative numbers that\nsum to 1, we define P(A) = λ1P1(A)+λP2(A), for every Borel set A. It is easily checked that\nP is also a probability measure. It is referred to as a mixture of P1 and P2.\n- Lebesgue decomposition theorem. Every probability measure P on (<, B) is of the form\nP = λ1P1 +λ2P2 +λ3P3, where P1 is discrete, P2 is absolutely continuous, and P3 is singular\nwithout any point mass, and the λi are nonnegative numbers that sum to 1. Furthermore, this\ndecomposition is unique.\n- The decomposition theorem is also true for measures on (<k , Bk)."
