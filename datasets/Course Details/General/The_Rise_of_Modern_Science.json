      "content": "MIT Student\nSTS.003\nPaper 1\n\nAlchemistry\n\nDespite the many aspects of each field which distinguish alchemy and chemistry, when viewed\nin sequential order as part of the larger historical context, the two seem natural neighbors in the\ntransition from religious mysticism to scientific inquiry. Their consanguinity is evidenced here by our\nexamination of two sources, Starkey's Alchemical Laboratory Notebooks and Correspondence and\nBoyle's New Experiments Physico-Mechanicall, and the motivations behind these pieces, one of which\nis the search by people throughout the ages to understand the universe. Claiming that this search is a\nvalid motivation for thousands of developments doesn't explain how these developments were able to\noccur, but it does immediately unite chemistry and alchemy as tools through which people attempted to\nunderstand the universe out of a deep-seated need**. In any case, chemistry and alchemy at their best\nseem to have this as a common starting point.\n\nAlchemy predates chemistry; Boyle, in fact, the \"Father of Modern Chemistry,\" was the student\nof alchemists - in particular, the student of Starkey himself. That alchemy is the older field can be\nviewed as an explanation of its more religious nature; the secret signs, the semi-magical transmutations\nare the relics of the pre-scientific world left extant as it transitions. Traces of this mysticism are found\nin Starkey's lab notes, as in his use of a symbol of his own invention for regulus of antimony1. Starkey\nis not writing in such a way that his notebooks seem intended to help others understand and build upon\nwhat he has himself discovered - evidence of this is he does not describe, in the final entry, the\nmysteries of alkehest which he feels have been revealed to him2. Here he differs starkly from Boyle,\nbut part of that may be due to the circumstances under which each piece was written; Boyle's was, after\nall, intended for publication. However, that Boyle intended his work for publication and that Starkey.\n\n.\n1Starkey, George. 2004 [1656]. Alchemical Laboratory Notebooks and Correspondence, ed. William R. Newman and\n\ndid not may be important distinctions between chemistry and alchemy. Alchemy may seem less suited1\nto the search for understanding, and therefore less likely to be a valuable step in the road from\nmysticism to science, because of its secrecy, but that may be unfair; the Pythagoreans, after all, were\nextremely secretive, lay on the border between mysticism and science, and would, nevertheless,\ncertainly be considered a step taken towards science and understanding. Alchemy was secret in part\nbecause he who discovered the mystery of transmutation could make himself - and his funders - rich,\nand because, since it sought answers to two main questions (is matter transmutable and can we make a\nphilosopher's stone), the man to solve either of these puzzles would win immortal glory. However,\nalchemy was also secretive because its results were considered too dangerous to be played with by the\nuninitiated and because, in later times, to be an alchemist was considered a sign of foolishness. The\nhuge pay offs to any man who unlocked the secrets of alchemy, evidenced by Starkey's agreement to\nwork for Captain Watson for half a year on the derivation of noble metals from the baser ones in return\nfor monetary remuneration3, and the belief that the alchemist could uncover dangerous information,\nmight therefore be looked at as explanations of its secrecy that still allow it to retain its status as one of\nthe ways through which human beings sought to uncover the mysteries of the universe.\n\nAlchemy, at least as taken from Starkey, might also seem less exact, and thus less scientific,\nthan chemistry (as taken from Boyle). Starkey's results are certainly related in qualitative and\nsometimes anthropomorphic (as in the \"vinous spirit\" which is \"friendly to that of urine\" 4) terms.\nTake, for example, his statement that the vinegar (when added to his urine/brandywine mixture)\n\"mortifies in a moment and advances into a deep color, and that the spirits attack one another with a\ncertain fuming and a sensible heat.\"5 However, he still tells us that the reaction is chemical, resulting in\na color change and release of heat, and that gases are produced as a byproduct. He also, in general,\n\nLawrence M. Principe, 127 - 129, 170 - 175. Chicago: The University of Chicago Press. (127)\n\n2 Starkey, 175.\n3 Starkey, 175.\n\n4 Starkey, 174.\n\n5 Starkey, 172.\n\nrelates the quantities of each amount of mixture he is adding. His experiments might be reproducible\nand his results verifiable, then, except that he does not always give a clear treatment of his methods (as\nwhen he refers to the \"perhaps six pints of phlegm\" he has removed6 - what exactly the \"phlegm\" is\nand how one ought to go about its removal goes unspecified). However, it is possible that Starkey\nincluded fewer exact specifications because his were private records and he considered himself able to\nremember any other relevant details. And, if he perhaps considered what the heirs to his notes would\ngain from them, he almost certainly assumed anyone reading his notes would also be an alchemist -\nperhaps the details he did not include he assumed any alchemist would be able to infer. Or, perhaps he\ndid not want any rivals to be able to use his results to beat him to finding a means of transmuting the\nbase to noble metals, although this seems unlikely - first, because his notebooks were private records,\nand second, because if he was so concerned, it seems he might have obfuscated more than just a few\ndetails here and there, especially details he seems to consider peripheral (as with the \"phlegm\" - he\nseems to consider it and its removal an unimportant sideline). His notes seem more like those of a man\nto himself, recording his experiments so that he could rely upon them in the future (as with his detailed\ndescription of the flammable properties of his urine mixture7). Looking only at Starkey's lab notebooks,\nit seems that Starkey may have undertaken his research with the intent to discover a solvent that could\nfurther some larger project, perhaps the transmutation of base metals to noble, in other words, spurred\nby material interests more than Boyle, but it is certainly true that he was excited and awed to discover\nthe secrets of (what he termed) alkehest, attributing his discoveries to the glory of God.\n\nThe main differences between the general form of Starkey's notes and the sort of notes we might\ntoday identify with scientific research are his assumptions and his reference to God (God's revelation of\nthe secret of Alkehest8. This admixture of religion and science seems to make sense if we cast alchemy\nas part of a transition from mysticism to science. However, Boyle was also a religious man and\n\nmentions God at least in his Preface9; even. today, religious beliefs are not a barrier to a profession in\nthe sciences - we have, though, imposed a. barrier between our religious and scientific publications.\nThe assumptions underlying Starkey's research, that metals could probably be transmuted, may seem\nakin to arbitrary beliefs by today's standards, but they were probably based on the belief that this\nknowledge had been possessed by the ancient Greeks and somehow lost, or at least that, by the nature\nof the observable world around him, it would be reasonable to predict transmutation. This isn't entirely\ndifferent than many of the intuitions that guide science today, although we have had hundreds of years\nto refine our concept of proper scientific method and to delineate patterns upon which to base our\nintuitions; the assumptions which underlie research, which form our questions, are controlled perhaps\nmore than any other factor, by the state of knowledge available to us at the time. Wider proof of this,\nnot just derived from two sources, is easily found in the history of math, for example in Russell's\ncriticisms* of the false assumptions in Euclid's Elements.\n\nChemistry, as taken from Boyle, seems closer to what today we call science than does alchemy,\nalthough it shares some of the same scientific \"shortcomings\" as Starkey's alchemy. For example,\nalthough the apparatus (the \"Engine\") being used to carry out the experiments is described in some\ndetail10, we are not given a diagram of the equipment or detailed instructions as to how to build it and\nthen carry out the experiments ourselves, although all of these may be included later in the work. Part\nof this, as Boyle himself says, is due to the expense of such undertakings, and to the inadequacy of one\npublished letter to allow someone to accurately reproduce his experiments in an era without\nstandardized equipment or supplies11. Perhaps Boyle is concerned that if he tries to detail exactly his\nexperimental set-up, because of the inadequacy aforementioned anyone who tried to recreate the\n\n.\n6 Starkey, 172.\n\n7 Starkey, 171.\n\n8 Starkey, 175.\n\n9 Boyle, Robert. 1660.

Hall, Printer to the University. (A7)\n.\n10 Boyle, 20.\n\n11 Boyle, Preface.\n\nexperiment would fail to reproduce his results; perhaps his own results would be discredited as a result.\nMaybe, then, he considered it in everyone's best interest to run his own experiment in such a way that\nhe and his observers were satisfied with its validity, and then to publish his results as an addition to the\ncanon of accepted knowledge12. Here, even though Boyle has brought up the importance of validating\none's results, in this case by saying that many ingenious men observed his experiment and found it\nconvincing12, and even though he intends to release his discoveries for others to build upon13, he has\nnot provided what today we would consider \"proof\" that the results of his experiments are valid.\nAlthough we've already noted that Boyle's and Starkey's works must be taken in context as,\nrespectively, intended for publication and intended for personal record-keeping, Boyle includes in his\ntext a key element of the modern scientific process entirely lacking in Starkey's: the intent to teach, to\nproffer his own work as a foundation upon which other mean might build14. Proof of his genuine intent\nto broaden the knowledge of his readers is in his use of metaphor. As we use our conception of modern\nscience today to improve our understanding of the human mind, the importance of the metaphor in\nlearning and even conceiving of new ideas has become more and more apparent15. The metaphor seems\nto be a tool which we use for much of our communication and especially our communication of new or\nabstract ideas. Therefore, when Boyle introduces the metaphor of sheep's wool for the air corpuscles16,\nand he uses it to explain the behaviour of air and the relation between air and its environment, he is\nclearly writing with the intent of bringing to his audience the understanding of something new.\n\nBy examining Starkey's Alchemical Laboratory Notebooks and Correspondence and Boyle's\nNew Experiments Physico-Mechanicall, we see that although alchemy and chemistry differ in some\nrespects, it is not the case that a clear fault-line runs between the two, separating chemistry from\nalchemy and science from religion, where we take \"science\" and \"religion\" to be defined not so much\nby what we take to be scientific or religious content, but by the methodologies of thinking they\nembody. Instead, it seems that both lie along the path from science to religion, that both sought to aid\nthe search for understanding.\n\n.\n\n.\n12 Boyle, A4.\n\n13 Boyle, A8.\n\n14 Boyle, Preface.\n\n15 Pinker, Steven. 2007.

      "content": "MIT Student\nProfessor David Jones & Professor David Kaiser\nSTS.003 The Rise of Modern Science\nPaper 1\nAlchemy & Chemistry; A Rose by Any Other Name.\nMost people today consider alchemy to be some sort of archaic black art; sorcerers\nworking in secret chambers to transmute lead into gold. Chemistry, on the other hand, is\nregarded as one of the most important branches of experimental science. Is this discrepancy\nhistorically accurate or has the classic portrayal given us a distorted view of the past? Evidence\nfrom primary sources seems to paint a slightly different picture. Alchemy and chemistry are two\nterms currently used to describe the nearly identical activities of various experimenters in the\n16th and 17th centuries who were later separated into two groups based on assessments of their\nalleged motives.\nWhen one begins to examine the similarities and differences between the excerpts from\nGeorge Starkey's Alchemical Laboratory Notebooks and Correspondence, and Robert Boyle's\nNew Experiments Physico-Mechanicall it becomes immediately apparent that the comparison\nwill be (in some respects) fundamentally flawed. Starkey's writings were taken mostly from a\nnotebook he used in the laboratory for recording the results of his daily experiments;1 Boyle's\nNew Experiments was a document he prepared intentionally for publication and circulation.2\n1 George Starkey, \"A Laboratory Notebook,\" in Alchemical Laboratory Notebooks and Correspondence, ed.\nWilliam R. Newman and Lawrence M. Principe (Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 2005), 127-129 & 170\n175, on 127.\n2 Boyle, Robert, \"New Experiments: Physico-Mechanicall, preface and pp. 20-37.\"\n\nStarkey's and Boyles works represent two entirely different classes of writing so attempting to\ndirectly compare these two documents is not a reasonable proposition. However, one can glean a\ngreat deal about the authors from their respective writings and use that knowledge to make an\nindirect comparison of their attitudes and methods.\nIt may be argued from Starkey's notes that he was not terribly concerned about the\nprecision of his measurements. He continually used phrases such as \"perhaps seven gallons\", \"I\nrectified the spirit three or four times\", and \"about nine pints\".3 These statements do not seem to\nmatch up to the careful measurements employed in modern labs, carried out to three or more\nsignificant figures. However, the context in this case is very important. Starkey was not\nattempting to determine how much of each ingredient was needed to result in a predetermined\namount of end product. He was in the process of discerning what that end product would be. This\nintent is clearly demonstrated by his detailed description of the 'spirit' at each stage of the\nprocess. In contrast he mentions the volume in passing, perhaps for the sake of completeness. It\nis also worth noting that he disposes of the unwanted by-products of each distillation and\nobserved at times that some portion of the vapors escaped through the joints of the apparatus,\nfurther lowering the significance of the volume of the original ingredients.4 Any accusation that\naccurate measurements were not important to Starkey can be definitively invalidated by the\nemphasis he places on exactness in his other writings. His concern with final and initial weights,\nhis quantitative analysis (borrowed from an influential mentor, Van Helmont), and his\ngravimetric technique all demonstrate that he was closer to an obsession with precision than an\nindifference towards it.5\n3 Starkey, \"A Laboratory Notebook,\" 170-171.\n4 Starkey, \"A Laboratory Notebook,\" 172\n5 William R. Newman and Lawrence M. Principe, Alchemy Tried in the Fire: Starkey, Boyle, and the Fate of\nHelmontian Chymistry, (Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 2002), 121\n\nStarkey's focused lab notes are starkly contrasted by the preface to Boyle's New\nExperiments. Boyle introduces his work with broad rhetoric--speaking of the spread of\n\"Experimental and Useful Philosophy\" and the hope that \"ingenious men\" would use his\ndiscoveries to benefit humanity.6\nBoyle goes to great length to convince his reader that the experiments he conducted with\na 'new pneumatical engine' (essentially an early vacuum pump) are rigorous, repeatable and\ntrustworthy. Based on these experiments he poses two alternate hypotheses to explain the nature\nof air pressure.7\nThe first hypothesis he presents consists mainly of the notion that the air consists of\nfibers similar to those of wool. They can bend and be compressed but always seek to regain their\noriginal size and shape. However, he does not seem to favor this approach to dealing with the\nproblem.\nBoyle's second hypothesis is one that he borrowed from Des Cartes; that air consists of\nsmall particles (corpuscles) which continually spin and push off of one another and any solid\nobject they encounter. The force of them jostling with one another accounts for air pressure. Of\ncourse this second proposition is much closer to our current understanding of how atoms in a\ngaseous state behave.\nBoyle presented two opposing ideas and offered both support and counter-arguments for\neach of them. This approach allowed him to earn a reputation for open-mindedness and honesty.\nIn addition, the methods employed by Boyle in his experiments are consistent with modern ideas\nof how such tests should be carried out. He used clearly explained equipment and procedures\n6 Boyle, Robert, \"New Experiments,\" preface\n7 Boyle, Robert, \"New Experiments,\" 22-25\n\nwhich could be reproduced by other natural philosophers or even a resourceful lay-person.8 This\nopenness has been heralded by many as ushering in the era of modern, collaborative science and\nis seen as an anti-type of secretive alchemy.\nAlchemists have often been condemned for their strict adherence to secrecy. Modern\ninvestigators live in a culture where academia is marked by a free exchange of information. This\nmakes them automatically suspicious of the methods and motives of anyone who works (or\nworked) secretly. However, once again context can provide us with a clearer understanding of\nthe intention of early alchemists. These men truly believed that while simultaneously working to\nsolve more practical problems, they were striving towards a comprehensive understanding of\nmatter itself along with the ability to manipulate it. This knowledge was therefore something\nwhich had to be guarded at all costs, lest it be revealed to an individual who would use such\nknowledge to cause great harm. Their purpose in silence may have been the same as the purpose\nof those who kept the Manhattan Project a secret. Indeed the two groups had the same ultimate\ngoal: absolute control over matter.\nAn important point to remember is that the terminology 'alchemy' and 'chemistry' are\nmore recent than the pursuits they describe. Both words are thought to have originally been\nderived from the Greek word khymeia which was used mostly to refer to what we now call\npharmaceutical chemistry.9 The more recent terms alchemia and chemia (Latin) were used\ninterchangeably by most authors in the 17th century.10 There seems to be no historically accurate\nand consistent distinction between chemistry and alchemy.

      "content": "MIT Student\n\nWeighing the Climate Change Scales\nToday in America, no unanimous conclusion exists on the state of global warming. According to a Gallup\npoll, the majority of Americans still believe global warming is a firmly established phenomenon, but as for what is\ncausing global warming, \"50% say temperature increases are due to human activities, and 46% say they are not,\"1\nand a portion of that forty-six percent doesn't believe climate change is happening at all. When looking at each\npopulation, different emphases and motivations become apparent, particularly that climate change 'supporters'\nfocus on environmental issues, and that climate change 'deniers' focus on economic, or financial, issues. The\ndebate over which impact is of greater concern can be represented as a set of scales, with environmental impacts\non one side, and financial impacts on the other. A through-and-through environmentalist assigns all the weight to\nthe environmental impacts with no regard for the financial repercussions. The denial community is represented\nwhen the majority of the weight is given to the financial impacts, and the reason for this will soon be apparent.\nThe particular examples that will illustrate this split between supporters and deniers involve the Irish film-maker,\nAnn McElhinney, and the Canadian military historian, Gwynne Dyer. The debate on climate change is strongly\ninfluenced by which impact, economic or environmental, is given more weight, and there are political and\neconomic forces that affect the way people distribute this weight.\nA method of identifying how economic, political, and financial factors influence the climate change denial\nmovement is developed by Naomi Oreskes and Erik Conway in their article, \"Challenging Knowledge: How Climate\nScience Became a Victim of the Cold War.\" The authors try to understand why a few rogue physicists, working\nunder the guise of the Marshall Institute, took a stance opposite to the majority of other scientists of their time,\nand their investigation reveals that these physicists actively denied the links between cigarette smoke and lung\ncancer, pollution and acid rain, CFCs and the ozone, and greenhouse gases and global warming. Oreskes and\nConway believe that the Cold War, anticommunist, pro-capitalism mentality was the motivation behind the\ndenials. \"Marshall Institute initiatives make sense when read as an expression of an uncompromising commitment\nto market capitalism - indeed, market fundamentalism - and a willingness to do whatever is necessary to prevent\n\n1 Frank Newport, \"Americans' Global Warming Concerns Continue to Drop\"\nhttp://www.gallup.com/poll/126560/americans-global-warming-concerns-continue-drop.aspx\n\ncreeping government control.\"2 This notion of 'market fundamentalism,' and the implied disapproval of\ngovernment regulation, is key to understanding the climate change denial trend. When market fundamentalism is\napplied to the environmental versus financial scales, almost all the weight goes with the financial impacts.\nAnn McElinney's basic approach to climate change can be summed up in one simple quote: \"There is no\nscientific basis for the current climate hysteria.\"3 She consistently argues throughout her article, entitled \"Kansas\nshould not repeat Europe's mistakes,\" a reference to the recent cap-and-trade legislation passed in Europe, that\nany proposed solution to climate change will result in a financial detriment for everyday, average Americans. The\nevidence she quotes to support these arguments is derived solely from predicted economic impacts of various\nproposed actions such as climate change legislation. Here is a typical piece of evidence in her essay, this time\nsupporting the construction of a new coal-fired power plant: \"It will boost the economy and create thousands of\njobs in construction and during many many years of operation. That's real money for real people - and income in\nthe form of tax revenue for the state.\"4 In addition to appealing to the economic advantages of inaction to global\nwarming, McElhinney also uses evidence to demonstrate that \"environmentalists use alarmism to win support for\neconomically devastating rules.\"5 McElhinney's opinions can be applied to the scales metaphor by placing\n\"potential or doubtful environmental impacts\" on one side, and the word \"self-imposed economic hindrance\" on\nthe other. If there are no environmental impacts, then there are no advantages to implementing a solution to\nthose impacts - instead there are only negative financial impacts. With this view of her arguments in mind, her\nstrategies become clear. McElhinney is trying to reach her audience on a personal level by appealing to the\nfinancial impacts individuals will feel in their everyday lives.\nIn the article, McElhinney quotes a study done by the Heritage foundation claiming the cap-and-trade\nlegislation being proposed in the Senate will cause the price of electricity in Kansas to jump by $928 a year, and\n\n2 Naomi Oreskes and Erik Conway, \"Challenging Knowledge: How Climate Science Became a Victim of the\nCold War\" in Agnotology: The Making and Unmaking of Ignorance ed. Robert Proctor and Londa\nSchiebinger (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2008), 76, 80\n3 Ann McElhinney, \"Kansas should not repeat Europe's mistakes\" available at http://wichitaliberty.org/\n\nenvironment/kansas-should-not-repeat-europes-mistakes/ (accessed 10 Nov 2010)\n4 McElhinney\n5 McElhinney\nMIT Student\n\nMIT Student\n\n\"gas would cost $1.31 more per gallon.\" 6 Notice how she quotes the price of gasoline per gallon rather than the\nprice of a barrel of oil, as is heard in most news outlets. This is an example of her strategy to appeal to individuals\nrather than to the country as a whole. Her audience is everyday Americans, and in particular, conservative\nAmericans of the Republican Party. The Heritage foundation, the source of the previous quote, is a Republican\norganization, as stated on their website. McElhinney has also spoken at the Conservative Political Action\nConference (CPAC), a conference that is billed as the largest annual gathering of conservatives in the United\nStates.7 Another tie between McElhinney and the Republican Party comes from the \"Kansas should not repeat\nEurope's mistakes\" article itself. I found the article posted on a blog run by a Kansas conservative, and at the top\nof the website ran the tagline: \"Individual liberty, limited government, and free markets in Wichita and Kansas.\"8\nMcElhinney's message of climate change denial is being supported and promoted by Republicans across the\ncountry. An article in the Washington Post said that, \"Few causes unite the conservatives of the newly elected\n112th Congress as unanimously as their opposition to government action on climate change.\"9 The Oreskes and\nConway methodology would describe the Republicans as the 'market fundamentalists' who strongly believe in\ncapitalism and its ability to produce economic prosperity. When this ideology is applied to the metaphorical scales\nof economic impacts versus environmental impacts, nearly all the weight goes to the economic impacts, and\nenvironmental impacts become secondary. The final step toward denying climate change outright may be thought\nof as an attempt to keep all the weight with economic impacts.\n\nThe second article, \"Climategate and Disbelief\" by historian Gwynne Dyer, stands in direct opposition to\nthe climate skeptics such as McElhinney. Dyer believes \"the weight of the evidence rests overwhelmingly on the\nside of those who argue that climate change is real and dangerous,\"10 which ties in perfectly to the scale\nmetaphor, that is, that the environmental impacts far outweigh any financial incursions. He likes to quote\n\n6 Ann McElhinney\n7\" Donegal-born film-maker slams blockbuster 'Avatar'\" available at http://www.donegaldemocrat.ie/\ndonegalnews/Donegalborn-filmmaker-slams-blockbuster-39Avatar39.6135188.jp\n8 Bob Weeks, \"Voice for Liberty In Wichita\", available at http://wichitaliberty.org/ (accessed 10 Nov 2010)\n9 Bracken Hendricks, \"Don't believe in global warming? That's not very conservative\"\nhttp://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/11/05/AR2010110503155.html?\nhpid=opinionsbox1 (accessed 10 Nov 2010)\n10 Gwynne Dyer, \"'Climategate' and Disbelief,\" available at http://gwynnedyer.com/2010/climategate%e2%80%9d-and-disbelief/\n\n(accessed 10 Nov 2010)\n\nMIT Student\n\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports for evidence, and one such piece of evidence is, \"Not all the\nHimalayan glaciers will be gone by 2035, but a lot of the ones at lower altitudes will be- including some of the ones\nthat keep the great rivers of Asia full in the summertime. That is important, because when they are gone, people\nstart to starve.\" When comparing this evidence with McElhinney's, it becomes clear that the two authors are\nindeed quoting evidence from two very different standpoints - environmental versus economic, and the fight over\nwhich one is more important is, perhaps, central to the climate change debate. Recently, the IPCC had a few\nscandals in which the integrity of the research being done proved to be subpar. Dyer comments that, \"This sort of\nthing happens from time to time, because we are dealing with human beings. But it does not (as the denial\nbrigade insists) discredit the whole enterprise in which they are engaged.\"11 This is a perfect example of the split\nbetween deniers and supporters of climate change. Many deniers of climate change often use the scandals as\nevidence that the research is flawed, which makes sense when one considers the market fundamentalism\nhypothesis. In order to defend and build an argument for their economic beliefs, they must minimize the negative\nimpacts of global warming. On the other hand, Dyer is predisposed to play down this possible flaw in the\npredicted environmental impacts because he ultimately is convinced that climate change is real, and therefore\nneeds to make the environmental impacts as strong as possible.\n\nTo get an idea of the audience Dyer is writing to, it is important to get a background on the historian.\nGwynne Dyer has worked as a freelance journalist, columnist, broadcaster and lecturer on international affairs for\nmore than 20 years, but he was originally trained as an historian. He received degrees from Canadian, American\nand British universities, served in three navies, and held academic appointments at the Royal Military Academy\nSandhurst and Oxford University. His articles are published by over 175 papers in some 45 countries.12 Dyer writes\nto a global audience about a very broad spectrum of topics. His most recent projects are a book and a radio series\ncalled 'Climate Wars', dealing with the geopolitics of climate change.13 This is contrasted with McElhinney's appeal\nto the individual, and her documentary on climate change, \"Not Evil, Just Wrong.\" One is left to wonder how these\ndifferent audiences, styles, and perspectives affect the message. Dyer's geopolitical, global, highly educated\n\n11 Dyer\n12 \"Gwynne Dyer\" bio at bottom of page, available at http://www.gwynnedyer.com/ (accessed 10 Nov 2010)\n13 Dyer's website\n\nMIT Student\n\nbackground has lead him to believe climate change is very real and that government regulation must be used to\nstop it; McElhinney focuses on effects individuals will feel and appeals to a conservative audience predisposed to\nagree with her message which protects the free market.\nDyer has a few comments in his article that express his own opinion of the climate change denial\nmovement: \"From being one of the least ideological countries fifty years ago, when much of the rest of the planet\nwas drunk on Marxist theories, [the United States] has become the most ideological today. Disbelief in climate\nchange has been turned into an ideological badge worn by the right, and evidence is no longer relevant.\"14 This\nideology Dyer speaks of could likely be based on the 'market fundamentalism' proposed by Oreskes and Conway.\nThese two ideas, when combined, assert that climate change denial is driven solely by economic motivations, and\nthis is demonstrated clearly by McElhinney and Dyer's opinions on the relationship between China and US.\nMcElhinney believes that climate change legislation is \"nothing more than a stimulus bill for China, a country that\nwill continue to emit carbon regardless [of US action].\"15 McElhinney cannot see any reason why China would try\nto prevent global warming, but can clearly see that the US will be at an economic disadvantage. Dyer, in contrast,\nbelieves that \"if the United States is out of the game, then China is out too,\" indicating that if the US does attempt\nto mitigate greenhouse gases, China will do the same because climate change is a global threat with negative\nconsequences for the planet. The two authors are clearly approaching the issue with different opinions.\n\nThe climate change debate is fundamentally split between those who believe the environment is worth\nprotecting, and those who believe that they are defending the economy and their own financial prosperity. The\nenvironmental impacts, derived from years of neutral, scientific research, have massive effects on the global\ncommunity, including economic effects. As Dyer points out, it is likely that the environmental impacts of climate\nchange, such as the rivers in India drying up, will translate into massive economic impacts. Market\nfundamentalists, on the other hand, do not consider these types of long term, potential economic impacts, nor do\nthey consider any scientific facts. They are concerned with the immediate repercussions individual Americans will\nfeel, and how specific sectors of the economy will respond to government regulations of climate change solutions.\n\n14 Dyer\n15 McElhinney\n\nMIT Student\n\nTo be more specific, McElhinney does not take economist's approach of factoring in all the economic\ndisadvantages and advantages. In fact, she failed to quote a single economic advantage climate change solutions\nmight bring, such as a boost in the green technologies sector. One is left to wonder where an ideology that avidly\ndefends the use of coal, oil, and natural gas originated from.\n\nMIT Student\n\nWorks Cited\nConway, Erik and Naomi Oreskes. \"Challenging Knowledge: How Climate Science Became a Victim of the\nCold War\" in Agnotology: The Making and Unmaking of Ignorance ed.

      "content": "MIT Student\nSTS.003 Fall 2010\nThe Impossible Climate Consensus\nIt was Pope Pius IX who said, \"A system which is repudiated by history...by\nexact science, by the observation of facts... would seem to have no need at all of\nrefutation.\" 1 He was speaking out against the then- revolutionary theory of evolution that\nhad recently been introduced by Darwin's 1859 publication of \"On the Origin of\nSpecies\". His statement seems an obvious one, and the converse seems equally as\nredundant; that a claim with the support of history, science, and fact, should have no need\nto further prove itself. Yet today, the theory of global warming (now termed \"climate\nchange\") faces constant controversy despite substantial factual evidence in its favor.\nEven in instances where observations regarding climate change cannot be denied, much\ndebate still takes place regarding whether the change is attributable to human causes, and\nwhether human reaction to the changes can make a difference. There are numerous\nopinions backing all sides of the dispute, most with educated sources providing\nconvincing arguments for their own views. Yet the question of why such a hotly\ncontested debate continues at all provides an interesting topic for examination.\nAccording to an article by Naomi Oreskes and Erik M. Conway, the\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has effectively stated that the debate\nshould be over, saying, \"most of the warming observed over the past 50 years is\nattributable to human activities.\"2 This implies both a certainty that warming has\n\n1 Professor David Jones, class lecture in STS.003, MIT, 04 October 2010.\n2 Naomi Orsekes and Erik M. Conway, \"Challenging Knowledge: How Climate Science Became a\nVictim of the Cold War\" in Agnotology the Making and Unmaking of Ignorance, ed. Robert N. Proctor and\nLonda Schiebinger (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2008), 55-89, on 55.\n\noccurred and that humans have been a large contributing factor. If the IPCC, an\nauthoritative source on the issue, has issued such unambiguous statements, how then can\nthe debate continue? The same Oreskes and Conway article goes on to cite polls\nindicating the general belief of the public that scientists continue to be in disagreement\nover the facts, with only a third of those polled believing global warming is caused by\nhumans. Due to the fact that the climate change issue deals with future consequences on\na global scale, the debate is not an easy one to reach public consensus on. Predictions\nfrom computer models, which provide a majority of data regarding climate change, can\nseem like abstractions to the general public. Additionally, direct effects of global changes\naren't easily seen on an individual basis, especially when compared with an issue like\nsmoking. The climate change debate is also susceptible to competing views of\nindividuals or corporations. However, perhaps more interesting is the justification of\nconflicting viewpoints with different interpretations of science itself.\nAustralian paleo-climatologist Robert M. Carter provides a polarizing view on the\nissue of climate change in his article, \"The Futile Quest for Climate Control\". Carter's\ngeneral claim is that there is no evidentiary support for human caused global warming,\nand that the observed climate changes of the past decade are merely part of a natural\ncycle. He attacks the scientific methods of the IPCC, and goes on to note the failure of\nthe IPCC to utilize the entire geological context in their climate analysis, thereby\ninvalidating their results. He further claims that; \"...the proper null hypothesis that the\nglobal climatic changes that we observe today are natural in origin has yet to be\n\ndisproven.\"3 Carter is a skeptic regarding the use of projections from computer climate\nmodels by the IPCC in their data regarding climate change. He claims that these models\nhave not been able to successfully predict trends, are overly reliant on highly variable\nparameters, and should not be used as impetus for policy making regarding climate\nchange. He clearly does not feel that carbon dioxide emission limitations should be\nimposed.\nAn article presenting an opinion contrary to Carter's is the position statement of\nthe Geological Society of America, revised as recently as April 2010. While\nacknowledging the occurrence of natural climate variation, the Geological Society states\nthat it agrees with the research of the IPCC and believes that \"...global climate has\nwarmed and that human activities (mainly greenhouse-gas emissions) account for most of\nthe warming since the middle 1900s.\"4 They further state agreement with the proposal to\nglobally reduce human carbon dioxide emissions in order to prevent further undesirable\nanthropogenic climate change from taking place. In an interesting counterargument to\nCarter's claim of lack of geological data, this report cites geologic sources which provide\ndata in evidence of definite higher temperatures in the end of the 1900s than during the\nprevious four hundred years.5 Furthermore, the Geological Society outlines the\nmethodology used to assess today's climate models which includes utilizing\npaleoclimatic studies of the earth's history. They however, did not come to the same\nconclusion as Carter, that today's trends are a natural and cyclic occurrence. In fact the\n\n3 Robert M. Carter, \"The Futile Quest for Climate Control,\" available at\nhttp://www.quadrant.org.au/magazine/issue/2008/451/the-futile-quest-for-climate-control (accessed 10\nOct 2010).\n4 The Geological Society of America, \"GSA Position Statement,\" available at\nhttp://www.geosociety.org/positions/pos10_climate.pdf (accessed 10 Oct 2010).\n5 The Geological Society of America, \"Position Statement\".\n\nGeological Society gives evidence to eliminate many long term natural causes that would\notherwise be potential causes for warming trends, including changes to Earth's orbit and\nsolar irradiance changes. The Society lists numerous effects they believe will come about\nas a result of this anthropogenic climate change, including loss of arctic ice,\ndisappearance of glaciers and subsequent lack of runoff, stress on farm crops, increased\nsoil erosion, ocean acidification, and ecosystem destabilization.6 They go on to\nrecommend public policy that reduces greenhouse gas emissions and invests in planning\nfor adaptation to whatever adverse effects could come about as a result of the emissions\nalready in the atmosphere.\nIn reading two sources on the same topic, especially two that both have such\ngeologically based arguments, the chasm between the two opinions is remarkable.\nExamining the sources in more depth elucidates competing political and economic\ninterests. To derail potential arguments of corrupt research funding or political tainting,\nCarter makes the interesting statement; \"An idea is not responsible for those who believe\nin it, and neither is the validity of a scientific hypothesis determined by the character or\nbeliefs of the person who funded the research.\"7 This simple statement is Carter's way of\nconveniently trying to protect his climate change views from being criticized due to his\nown affiliations.\nRobert Carter currently works as a research professor, having obtained a PhD in\n1968 from Cambridge University. He has published numerous papers and in August of\n2010 published a book titled Climate: The Counter Consensus. Carter presents his ideas\n\n6 The Geological Society of America, \"Position Statement\".\n7 Carter, \"Futile Quest\".\n\nin a convincing manner, and is obviously an educated scientist, well versed in his fields.\nWhy then, does he produce arguments so contrary to widely believed scientific authority?\nWhile the IPCC, at least under Carter's analysis, could be called corrupt, \"...the IPCC\nconclusions have been ratified by every major scientific society in the United States with\npertinent expertise, including the American Geophysical Union, the American\nMeteorological Society, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science.\nOutside the United States, they have been affirmed by the Royal Society...and by a joint\nstatement by the National Academies of Science of eleven nations...\"8 Thus it would\nseem that Carter's views must at least partially be in his own best interests, to so radically\ncontradict such a wide agreement. Looking more into Carter's affiliations, potential\nmotivations become clearer. For example, he is a science policy advisor for the Institute\nof Public Affairs, a conservative think-tank whose donors have included Exxon Mobile,\nand various Mining companies.9 These donors have obvious interests in the climate\nchange debate, as policy changes that limit or heavily tax fossil fuel use would severely\nhurt their businesses. However, perhaps most interesting is that \"...his [Carter's] more\ngeneral stratigraphic work contributes towards the research base which underpins the\nexploration for and development of sedimentary mineral deposits, including the\nimportant energy resources of coal, oil, gas and uranium.\"10 So while Carter claims that\nideas and the motivations of those who support them should not be co-considered, it very\n\n8 Oreskes, Conway, \"Challenging Knowledge,\" 57.\n9 On IPA funding, see http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/11/26/1101219743320.html\n(accessed 10 Oct 2010).\n\n10 On the biography of Robert Carter, see http://myprofile.cos.com/glrmc (accessed 10 Oct\n2010).\n\nwell may be that he has a vested economic interest in continued research and use of fossil\nfuels.\nThe Geological Society of America was founded in 1888 by some of the early\nmembers of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, a group cited in a\nquote above to be in agreement with the IPCC conclusions on climate change today.11\nTheir current president, Joaquin Ruiz, received a PhD in Geology, and has worked as the\nassociate editor of the American journal of science, been a member of the National\nResearch Council, and been a panel member of the National Sciences Foundation.12 The\nprime sponsor of the GSA, as listed on their website, is Subaru of America.13 Though\none might expect car companies to have a vested interest in the opposite viewpoint,\nperhaps Subaru is attempting to portray an image of climate friendliness, to help their\nown public opinion.\nIt seems that the differences between these sources' views arise not from real\ndifferences in data, but from competing economic motivations, and the arguments are\njustified by opposing interpretations of valid science. The GSA readily accepts the widely\nbelieved theories proposed by the IPCC and related organizations, including the\nprojections from computer models. Much of Carter's paper, however, is dedicated to\nhighlighting the corruption of the study of climate change, including use of \"selective\nscience\" to emphasize only certain data, and political biases. Carter also goes out of his\nway to bring up many of the arguments made against his viewpoint to try and disprove\n\n11 On the Founding of the Geological Society of America, see\nhttp://www.geosociety.org/aboutus/intro.htm (accessed 16 Oct 2010).\n12 On the resume of Joaquin Ruiz, see http://www.geo.arizona.edu/web/Ruiz/JR_CV_9-04.pdf\n(accessed 16 Oct 2010).\n13 On the sponsorship of the Geological Society of America, see\nhttp://www.geosociety.org/aboutus/sponsor.htm (accessed 16 Oct 2010).\n\nthem. He believes that there can never be a consensus on an issue of science, because\nscience by nature is constant skepticism and testing. Carter seems to treat the fact that\nthere is such a consensus as a reason to not believe the same theories. He even references\nthe time of Galileo, when the \"scientific consensus\" was based on the desires of the\nchurch instead of real research. Carter believes all scientists must be skeptics, and feels\nthat those in the position of the GSA are blindly following the herd. Carter is very\nstringent in his definition of a scientific truth, which he says stands only when \"...it is\nformulated as a rigorous hypothesis that has survived testing by many different\nscientists.\"14 This is why, when defending his own point of view, Carter purposefully\nemphasizes the most how there is no evidence to directly disprove it. However, a reading\nof the GSA position statement using Carter's own definition of science seems to validate\nthe GSA's stance. Their claim that anthropogenic climate change has occurred is\ncertainly a hypothesis, and they cite many different sources of data that do seem to\nconfirm their argument and invalidate Carter's. They reference not only climate models,\nbut the geological record, ground station measurements, and satellite data.\nThe climate change debate continues to exist in the face of wide consensus\nbecause there are those who want it to exist. There are groups and people like Robert\nCarter, who for reasons varying from differing views on the nature of science itself to\ndifferent economic motivations, want the public to remain unsure of what to believe.\nUltimately the public decides who is voted into political office, where policy changes can\nbe made. Thus, affecting public opinion and causing uncertainty (much like the Marshall\n\n14 Carter, \"Futile Quest\".\n\nInstitute of the Cold War era) can truly change what is done about global issues such as\nclimate change.\n\nWorks Cited\nCarter, Robert M. 2008. \"The Futile Quest for Climate Control.\" The Quadrant 451\nCarter, Robert M. 2009. \"Individual Expertise Profile of Robert M.

Here is a template for\nhow to format footnote and bibliography entries. These are neither \"suggestions\" nor\n\"guidelines,\" but rather unyielding, sacrosanct rules. Failure to follow these rules will\nlead, in all likelihood, to anarchy--cats and dogs living together, time flowing backward,\nthe works. Do not risk even the slightest deviation. Exceptions will not be tolerated.\nAlthough not as potent in its destructive powers as bad citation practice, the lack\nof page numbers is the demonic half-sibling of mangled footnote and bibliography\nentries. Use page numbers on your documents, and do your part to hold the forces of\ndarkness at bay.\nFOOTNOTES\nGeneral information\nThe first time an item appears in a footnote, you must provide the full and\ncomplete citation for it. Whenever the same item appears in later footnotes, you should\nuse only the author's last name and an abbreviated title, along with the appropriate page\nreferences for the specific point you are either paraphrasing or quoting. The abbreviated\ntitle may be as short as one word, or as long as a phrase. The point is that the form of\nyour footnote should allow your reader to identify uniquely the source you are citing.\nExamples may be found below.\nSometimes you will want to cite an item in its entirety, without specifying\nparticular pages or chapters; other times you will need to be more specific in your\ncitation. Make certain your footnote conveys all of the required information: if you\nmean to cite a particular portion or section or page of the item, then do so.\nIf you are quoting directly from a source in the body of your text, then your\nfootnote must include the specific page number on which the quotation appears.\nFootnotes should be indented by one tab. Note also where periods and commas\nappear, what is capitalized and what is not, as well as the order in which authors' names\nappear.\nIf an item has more than three authors, you may list the first author followed by\n\"et al.\" \"Et\" has no period; \"al.\" does: it is an abbreviation for \"alia.\"\nSome journals now require that the month (and sometimes also date) be given in\njournal citations, in addition to year. Feel free to include such information, although I do\nnot require it. If you do include it, it should be in standard abbreviated-date format, as\nindicated below in sample footnotes 16 and 18.\nPublishers often have offices in more than one city, and may list several cities on\nthe title or copyright pages of their books. In your references, it is common to use only\nthe city closest to where you are working (a holdover from pre-global-market days, no\ndoubt). For instance, in Boston it is common to write \"New York\" when citing books\npublished by Cambridge University Press, rather than Cambridge, England. [Note: the\n\nFootnotes, Bibliographies, and the Good Life\nChicago Manual of Style still recommends using only city name and not publisher name\nin both footnote and bibliography entries. This is a sign of madness, especially given the\ndispersal of publishers: city name alone offers little to no information that can be used to\nidentify the publisher. Ignore the much-vaunted Manual on this point. They are just\nplain wrong.]\nOften the sources you cite will be reprints or later editions of a work that had\nappeared much earlier. The page numbers, and even chapter ordering, can change\nbetween various editions, so it is imperative that you cite the exact edition from which\nyou have found your quotation or material. Additionally, even if you are citing a\nfacsimile reproduction of an older source, it is usually important to include the original\ndate of publication, even if the page numbers in your version have not changed from the\noriginal. Your reader will be much better informed if you indicate that Thomas Sprat's\nThe History of the Royal Society was published originally in 1667, even though you\nhappen to be working from an edition published in 1958.\nIf citing a web-based source, you should aim to make the citation as close as\npossible to that for an ordinary journal article. If the web content has a signed author\n(individual or collective), include that author name. If the web content has a specific\ntitle, include that title. In addition, you should include enough of the URL so that any\nreasonable user could re-trace your steps and find the same material. You need not\nreproduce the entire URL, which can often run several lines long, if the URL in question\nis an obvious link off of a main page, such as the web exhibitions available at the\nAmerican Institute of Physics's Center for History of Physics page\n(http://www.aip.org/history). Since web material can float in and out of accessibility, you\nmust also include the date on which you accessed that material.\nWhen more than one item appears in a footnote, separate each entry with a\nsemicolon, as in sample footnote 25.\nBooks:\n1Lorraine Daston and Katherine Park, Wonders and the Order of Nature, 1150\n1750 (New York: Zone Books, 1998), chaps. 2, 3.\n2Daston and Park, Wonders, 455.\n3Alison Winter, Mesmerized: Powers of Mind in Victorian Britain (Chicago:\nUniversity of Chicago Press, 1998), 132.\n4Robert Kohler, Lords of the Fly: Drosophila Genetics and the Experimental Life\n(Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1994).\n5Daniel Kevles, The Physicists: The History of a Scientific Community in Modern\nAmerica, 3rd ed.

General classes of phenomena\n3. Self-consistent theories\n4. Critical debate\n\nSome Caveats\nWe have infinitely more documents from the\n―prescientific‖ Babylonians and Egyptians than from the\n―proto-scientific‖ Presocratics!\nThere does not exist a single original document from the\nPresocratics. All of our information about them comes\nfrom (much) later commentaries.\n\"Others say that the earth rests on water. For this is the most ancient\naccount we have received, which they say was given by Thales the\nMilesian, that it stays in place through floating like a log or some other\nsuch thing (for none of these rests by nature on air, but on water) -- as\nthough the same argument did not apply to the water supporting the\nearth as to the earth itself.\" (R, 9)\n-- Aristotle de caelo B 13, 294a28.\n\nConstructing Legacies\nThe later commentators, such as Aristotle, arranged the\nPresocratics into neat and tidy genealogies: A taught B, B\ntaught C' -- at a remove of 300 years!\nMoreover, the later commentators had a stake in\nreconstructing the past to make things appear to lead\nstraight to them.\nImage of \"Newton's Principia For the Common Reader,\" S.

Chandrasekhar removed due to copyright restrictions.\n\nIonians or Milesians\nEast coast of modern-day Turkey, fl. 580-530 BCE\nAthens\nMiletus\n\nThales\nAristotle: ―Thales, the founder of this type of\nphilosophy, says that it [the original principle\nof all things] is water, perhaps taking this\nsupposition from seeing the nature of all things\n(like seeds) to be moist.‖\nThales attributed the unity of the cosmos\nto a substance of ordinary experience,\nrather than to the activity of the gods.\nPerhaps he chose water because of its mutability: it can\nappear as a solid, liquid, or vapor.\nProblem: How are non-wet things\nrelated to water? Over-specificity.\n\nAnaximander\nSimplicius: ―Anaximander, the successor and\npupil of Thales, said that the principle and\nelement of existence was the apeiron\n[Boundless], from which come into being all\nthe heavens and the worlds in them.‖\nThe raw material (apeiron) is\nindestructible and everlasting.\n(Iocane powder, anyone?)\nSolved Thales's problem of over-specificity by\nbeginning with a non-ordinary substance. But\nhe still left the nature of apeiron vague.\nImage of Wallace Shawn as Vizzini in \"The Princes Bride\"\n(1987) removed due to copyright restrictions.\n\nAnaximenes\nTheophrastus: ―Anaximenes, a companion of\nAnaximander, also says, like him, that the\nunderlying nature is one and infinite, but not\nundefined as Anaximander said but definite,\nfor he identifies it as air; and it differs in its\nsubstantial nature by rarity and density. Being\nmade finer it becomes fire, being made thicker\nit becomes wind, then cloud, then water, then\nearth, then stones; and the rest come into being\nfrom these.‖\nCritical debate': Anaximenes is presented as\nengaging with Thales's and Anaximander's ideas,\ntrying to strengthen their weaknesses.\n\nAtomists\nAbdera\nLeucippus and Democritus,\nfl. 440-400 BCE\n―atom‖: indivisible\nThe variety of matter we\nsee around us arises from\nchanges in the shape, arrangement, and position of atoms.\nThe atoms themselves are eternal and unchanging.\nshape:\nA vs. M\narrangement:\nAM vs. MA\nposition:\nM vs. W\n\nPlato's Academy\nSocrates\nPlato\nAristotle\nPlato's Academy in Athens (founded\n387 BCE) became one of the first\nstatic' educational institutions, with\nregular faculty teaching a variety of\nsubjects.\nNot like today's universities: no\ndegrees, no requirements, no term\nlimits.' Aristotle arrived at age 17 and\nstayed for 20 years!\nPlato (428 - 347 BCE) was a disciple\nof Socrates, and the principal defender\nof Socrates's legacy following his\nexecution for ―impiety‖ in 399.\n\nThe Allegory of the Cave\nJan Saenredam engraving, 1604\n\nPlato's World\nPlato held that a god-like\ncraftsman (not omnipotent)\ncreated all material things\nby (imperfectly) impressing\nthe ideal forms into a kind\nof malleable clay: the\n―Receptacle of Becoming,‖\nakin to Anaximander's\napeiron.\nMedieval manuscript, translation and commentary\non the Timaeus, ca. AD 900\nPhilosophers should only concern themselves with\nthe ideal forms: only those are perfect and unchanging.\n\n―The Peripatetic‖\nAristotle (384 - 321\nBCE) hailed from\nMacedonia. He studied at\nPlato's Academy from 367\n- 347. After Plato died,\nAristotle fled Athens for\nthe island of Lesbos.\nIn 343, the king of\nMacedonia asked Aristotle\nto tutor his son, Alexander\n(the Great).\nAthens\nMiletus\nAbdera\nMacedonia\nLesbos\nAristotle returned to Athens ca. 335 and founded his\nLyceum, which flourished until Alexander's death in 322.\nAristotle again fled Athens, and died one year later.\n\n―The Philosopher‖\nAristotle's works\ndefined what it meant\nto be a scholar for\nnearly 2000 years. He\nwrote on everything\nfrom logic, rhetoric,\nand aesthetics to\nnatural philosophy,\nmetaphysics, politics,\nethics, and more.\nAncient sources credit Aristotle with writing\nabout 150 books, totaling about 6000 (modern)\npages. About one-third of his works have survived.\nMedieval Latin translation, ca. 1400\nLondon edition, 1753\n\nConvoluted Provenance\nAfter Aristotle's death, his\nstudent Theophrastus\ngathered the manuscripts and\ngave them to his nephew,\nwho buried them in a cave in\nScepsis (modern-day Turkey)\n-- to keep them out of the\nhands of angry Athenians.\nThey remained there for two centuries until they were re-\ndiscovered; transfered to Athens and then to Rome. The\nphilosopher Andronicus prepared an edition ca. 50 BCE.\n―Our‖ Aristotle is almost entirely the product of\nAndronicus's filtering, editing, and compiling.\nPhoto courtesy of ImagesFromBulgaria.com.\n\n―Like Eating Dried Hay‖\nAristotle's writings seem particularly strange to modern eyes.\nThey were likely lecture notes from the Lyceum (his own plus\nsome of his students'), not meant for broad circulation.\nArchimedes Palimpsest: 10th century manuscript\noverwritten with 12th century religious text.\n-skips steps in arguments\n-repetition or minor\nvariations\n-outright contradictions\n\nEverything in its Place\nTerrestrial sphere: everything is\nmade of 4 elements. Compound\nbodies always undergo change and\ndecay, as the proportions of the 4\nelements change.\nCelestial sphere: everything is\nmade of just 1 element,\n―quintessence.‖ Since there is\nonly one type of stuff, there can\nbe no change: the heavens are\neternal and unchanging.\nVincenzo Coronelli, Terrestrial and Celestial Globes, 1688 - 1693\nPhotos of Vincenzo Coronelli's terrestrial and celestia\nglobes removed due to copyright restrictions.\nl\n\nThe Four Elements\nClear lineage from the Milesian school;\nand some borrowing from the Atomists.\nPhoto courtesy of Blaz Vizjak\non Flickr.\nPhoto courtesy of kevindooley\non Flickr.\nPhoto courtesy of Snap(r) on Flickr.\nPhoto courtesy of Loving Earth on Flickr.\n\nWhy the Greeks?\nEgotism? Later Greek philosophers\nattributed the birth of natural philosophy\nto the ―miracle of the Greek mind.‖\nWealth? Maybe they could afford\na group of people whose job it was\nto speculate all day. But others at\nthe time had ―leisure classes,‖ too.\nLiteracy? Written texts permit critical\ninspection of ideas. But others had earlier\nalphabets, and most Presocratic\ncommunication was oral, not written.\nPhoto courtesy of Mr G's Travels on Flickr.\nImage of \"Nice Work If You Can Get It\" by George Gershwin and\nIra Gershwin (1937) removed due to copyright restrictions.\n\nThe Role of Politics\nInternational trade made Miletus a\nleading city by 700 BCE. Mercantile\nwealth broke the political power of the\nlanded aristocracy. Merchants, in turn,\nneeded laws to guarantee contracts:\nfirst Milesian constitution ca. 594 BCE.\nThese societal changes created an\natmosphere of reasoned debate; they\ncreated a culture of critique and\ndiscussion.\n―Reason‖ was invented in politics, and then\napplied to nature. What we call ―science‖ might have\nits earliest roots in politics.\nImages of \"Adversaries and Authorities: Investigations Into\nAncient Greek and Chinese Science\" and \"The Ambitions of\nCuriosity: Understanding the World in Ancient Greece and China,\"\nboth G.E.R.

France\nwas fighting wars against Prussia and\nAustria, and internal factions divided\nthe country. The Legislature\nappointed a 12-person \"Committee\non Public Safety,\" which quickly\nimposed martial law.\nBetween September 1793 and\nJuly 1794, tens of thousands of\npeople were charged with \"treason\"\nand sent to the guillotine.\nExecu7on of Louis XVI, January 1793 \n\nPriestley: Dissenting Chemist\nEllen Sharples, Joseph Priestley, 1794 \nJoseph Priestley (1733 - 1804) was\nbarred from Oxbridge because of his\nreligious beliefs. He was educated in\nDissenting Academies outside\nLondon, with their mix of abstract\ntheory and practical application. His\nwork was principally supported by\nnew institutions like the Lunar Society\nof Birmingham, rather than the Royal\nSociety.\nA master experimentalist and writer,\nPriestley discovered more new gases than any\nof his contemporaries.\n\nPhlogiston\nJ. Priestley, Experiments and Observa(ons on \nDifferent Kinds of Air, 1774 \nwood + common air\n\nash + phlogisticated air\nCommon air can only absorb so\nmuch phlogiston before it becomes\nsaturated. Thus the flame of a\nburning candle placed in a sealed jar\nwill go out. The air that remains inside the container\n(\"phlogisticated air\") will support neither combusion nor\nrespiration (poor mouse).\nImmediate public health applications: test the\n\"goodness\" of air in prisons, mines, hospitals, and\nschools.\n\nDephlogisticated Air\nPriestley found that when he\nheated mercury in ordinary air,\nit formed a red precipitate.\nUpon heating the precipitate, a\nnew kind of air was released that\ncould revive asphyxiated mice.\nFlames burned brigher in the new\nair as well. Priestley called it \"vital air\" or \"dephlogisticated air\":\nthe new air was able to absorb even more phlogiston than\ncommon air.\nIn 1774, Priestley traveled to Paris and told the\nLavoisiers about his experiments.\nImage of calx of mercury removed due to copyright restrictions.\n\nJacques‐Louis David, Monsieur de \nLavoisier and his wife, Marie‐Anne Paulze, \nAntoine-Laurent Lavoisier (1743 -\n1794) was born into an aristocratic\nfamily. He was elected at an early age\nto the Academie Royale des\nSciences, and also served as a royal\ntax collector.\nHis wife trained herself to assist in the laboratory. She\nalso learned English to be able to read and correspond with\nEnglish chemists like Priestley. And she drew detailed\nillustrations to accompany Lavoisier's publications.\nLavoisier: Aristocratic Chemist\n\nMass Balance\nLavoisier, Traite elementaire de chimie, 1789 \nInspired by advances in physics,\nLavoisier sought precision and\nquantification. He carefully weighed\nreactants before and after\ncombustion to ensure that total mass\nwas conserved. When he re-did\nPriestley's experiment with mercury,\nhe found that the precipitate weighed\nmore than the original sample. How\ncould that be, if combustion involved the release of phlogiston?\nPriestley was skeptical in part because Lavoisier's\napparatus was too elaborate. Few others could afford\ncomparable equipment or replicate the results.\n\nPriority Dispute\nLavoisier contined to\nexperiment with the special air.\nBy the late 1770s, he found that\nnitrogen, and phosphorus all\nthe acids of sulfur, carbon,\nImage of \"Oxygen,\" Carl Djerassi and Roald Hoffmann,\nremoved due to copyright restrictions.\ncontained \"eminently respirable\nair.\" He concluded that all acids\nmust come from that air, so he\nnamed it \"oxygen\" (acid\ngenerating).\nTo Lavoisier, combustion arose when a burning\nsubstance combined with oxygen from the air--hence\nthe weight gain. But why was heat released? \"Caloric\": a\nfluid of pure heat, with no weight of its own.\n\nReform Nomenclature\nLavoisier, Elements of Chemistry, 1790 \nChemical nomenclature was a mess:\nsubstances were named for their\ncomposition, or the site they were found,\nor their discoverer, ... No order, no\nsystem.\nInspired by Condillac and the\nEncyclopedie, Lavoisier introduced a\n\"rational order\" based on analysis: start\nwith the simplest substances that cannot\nbe further broken down, and build up\nfrom there.\n\nReform Teaching\nLavoisier aimed to reform chemical\ntraining in the same way: students\nshould begin with the simplest\nsubstances and proceed to complex\nones. The new names meant that\nstudents no longer needed to re-do\nevery experiment along the way.\nThe goal was to make it possible to\ntrain chemists in a year or two rather\nthan via lifetime apprenticeships.\n\nIgnoble Ends\nPriestley's home laboratory\nwas attacked by an angry mob in\n1791 because of his outspoken\nsupport of the French\nRevolution. He fled to the US\nin 1794.\nLavoisier was arrested\nbecause of his work as a\nroyal tax collector. He was\ntried, convicted, and\nexecuted by guillotine on\nthe same day: 8 May 1794.\nC. J. Hullmandel, Destruc(on of Joseph Priestley's \nHome and Laboratory, 1791 \nLavoisier arrested in his laboratory, 1793 \n\nW. H. Worthington, John Dalton, 1895 \nDalton and Vapors\nJohn Dalton (1766 - 1844)\nwas a Quaker. Like Priestley,\nhe was educated in Dissenting\nAcademies; he was largely self-\ntaught in natural philosophy.\nDalton was fascinated by the\nsoggy climate of England's Lake\nDistrict. He studied vapor\npressure.\nLaw of Partial Pressures, 1801: in a mixture of gases,\neach gas contributes pressure as if it were alone. The\ntotal vapor pressure is the sum of each partial pressure.\n\nChemical and Physical Atoms\nDalton, A New System of Chemical \nPhilosophy, 1808 \nDalton explained his result by assuming\nthat every substance consists of atoms. The\natoms of a given substance are identical to\neach other, but different from those of\nother substances.\nDalton believed that atoms of different\nelements had different weights. The ratios\nby weight of constituents in chemical\ncompounds arose from the different\nrelative weights of the underlying atoms.\n\nAtoms or Elements?\nLavoisier had assumed that any list\nof elements was temporary. An\n\"element,\" to him, meant a substance\nthat chemists had not yet further\nreduced to simpler substances.\nDalton thought otherwise:\nthe world is made of \"solid,\nmassy, hard, impenetrable,\nmoveable Particles\" or\natoms. They were eternal\nand unchanging, and they\ncorresponded uniquely to\nchemical elements.\n\nSerfs and Substances\nS. Ivanov, A Peasant Leaving his Landlord on \nYuriev Day, ca. 1890 \nIn 1861, the Russian Tsar\nemancipated the serfs\nthroughout the Russian empire.\nThe universities were flooded\nwith new students. Dmitri\nMendeleev (1834 - 1907), a\nyoung chemistry professor in St.\nPetersburg, began writing a new\ntextbook.\nLavoisier had identified 33 elements. By Mendeleev's\nday, 63 were known. He eschewed chemical theory and\nfocused on laboratory techniques: how do chemists\nlearn about simple substances?\n\nMendeleev's first dra_ of the table, Feb. 1869 \nClassify!\nBy late January 1869, Mendeleev\nhad finished volume 1 of his\ntextbook, having only treated 8\nelements -- that left 55 to go!\nHe latched on to atomic\nweight: it was numerical, not\nrandom, and it offered some\nsystem for plowing through\nthe rest of the material.\nMendeleev's first published periodic table, 1869 \n\nFrom Classroom to Nature\nMendeleev left gaps in his table to be\nfilled in: he predicted the weights and\nchemical properties of three new\nelements.\nThe discovery of those \"missing\"\nelements in the 1870s helped to\nestablish Mendeleev's reputation and\nthat of his periodic table.\nThe discoveries also helped to solidify the association\nbetween chemical elements and physical atoms.\nImage of \"A Well Ordered Thing: Dimitrii Mendeleev and\nthe Shadow of the Periodic Table,\" Michael D.

      "content": "From Physics, by Aristotle\nWritten 350 B.C.E\nTranslated by R. P. Hardie and R. K. Gaye (now in public domain)\nText source: http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/physics.html\nBook II\nOf things that exist, some exist by nature, some from other causes.\n'By nature' the animals and their parts exist, and the plants and the simple bodies (earth, fire, air, water)\nfor we say that these and the like exist 'by nature'.\nAll the things mentioned present a feature in which they differ from things which are not constituted by\nnature. Each of them has within itself a principle of motion and of stationariness (in respect of place, or of\ngrowth and decrease, or by way of alteration). On the other hand, a bed and a coat and anything else of\nthat sort, qua receiving these designations i.e. in so far as they are products of art-have no innate impulse\nto change. But in so far as they happen to be composed of stone or of earth or of a mixture of the two,\nthey do have such an impulse, and just to that extent which seems to indicate that nature is a source or\ncause of being moved and of being at rest in that to which it belongs primarily, in virtue of itself and not\nin virtue of a concomitant attribute.\nI say 'not in virtue of a concomitant attribute', because (for instance) a man who is a doctor might cure\nhimself. Nevertheless it is not in so far as he is a patient that he possesses the art of medicine: it merely\nhas happened that the same man is doctor and patient-and that is why these attributes are not always\nfound together. So it is with all other artificial products. None of them has in itself the source of its own\nproduction. But while in some cases (for instance houses and the other products of manual labour) that\nprinciple is in something else external to the thing, in others those which may cause a change in\nthemselves in virtue of a concomitant attribute-it lies in the things themselves (but not in virtue of what\nthey are).\n'Nature' then is what has been stated. Things 'have a nature'which have a principle of this kind. Each of\nthem is a substance; for it is a subject, and nature always implies a subject in which it inheres.\nThe term 'according to nature' is applied to all these things and also to the attributes which belong to\nthem in virtue of what they are, for instance the property of fire to be carried upwards-which is not a\n'nature' nor 'has a nature' but is 'by nature' or 'according to nature'.\nWhat nature is, then, and the meaning of the terms 'by nature' and 'according to nature', has been stated.\nThat nature exists, it would be absurd to try to prove; for it is obvious that there are many things of this\nkind, and to prove what is obvious by what is not is the mark of a man who is unable to distinguish what\nis self-evident from what is not. (This state of mind is clearly possible. A man blind from birth might\nreason about colours. Presumably therefore such persons must be talking about words without any\nthought to correspond.)\n\nSome identify the nature or substance of a natural object with that immediate constituent of it which taken\nby itself is without arrangement, e.g. the wood is the 'nature' of the bed, and the bronze the 'nature' of the\nstatue.\nAs an indication of this Antiphon points out that if you planted a bed and the rotting wood acquired the\npower of sending up a shoot, it would not be a bed that would come up, but wood-which shows that the\narrangement in accordance with the rules of the art is merely an incidental attribute, whereas the real\nnature is the other, which, further, persists continuously through the process of making.\nBut if the material of each of these objects has itself the same relation to something else, say bronze (or\ngold) to water, bones (or wood) to earth and so on, that (they say) would be their nature and essence.\nConsequently some assert earth, others fire or air or water or some or all of these, to be the nature of the\nthings that are. For whatever any one of them supposed to have this character-whether one thing or more\nthan one thing-this or these he declared to be the whole of substance, all else being its affections, states, or\ndispositions. Every such thing they held to be eternal (for it could not pass into anything else), but other\nthings to come into being and cease to be times without number.\nThis then is one account of 'nature', namely that it is the immediate material substratum of things which\nhave in themselves a principle of motion or change.\nAnother account is that 'nature' is the shape or form which is specified in the definition of the thing.\nFor the word 'nature' is applied to what is according to nature and the natural in the same way as 'art' is\napplied to what is artistic or a work of art. We should not say in the latter case that there is anything\nartistic about a thing, if it is a bed only potentially, not yet having the form of a bed; nor should we call it\na work of art. The same is true of natural compounds. What is potentially flesh or bone has not yet its own\n'nature', and does not exist until it receives the form specified in the definition, which we name in\ndefining what flesh or bone is. Thus in the second sense of 'nature' it would be the shape or form (not\nseparable except in statement) of things which have in themselves a source of motion. (The combination\nof the two, e.g. man, is not 'nature' but 'by nature' or 'natural'.)\nThe form indeed is 'nature' rather than the matter; for a thing is more properly said to be what it is when\nit has attained to fulfilment than when it exists potentially. Again man is born from man, but not bed from\nbed. That is why people say that the figure is not the nature of a bed, but the wood is-if the bed sprouted\nnot a bed but wood would come up. But even if the figure is art, then on the same principle the shape of\nman is his nature. For man is born from man.\nWe also speak of a thing's nature as being exhibited in the process of growth by which its nature is\nattained. The 'nature' in this sense is not like 'doctoring', which leads not to the art of doctoring but to\nhealth. Doctoring must start from the art, not lead to it. But it is not in this way that nature (in the one\nsense) is related to nature (in the other). What grows qua growing grows from something into something.\nInto what then does it grow? Not into that from which it arose but into that to which it tends. The shape\nthen is nature.\n'Shape' and 'nature', it should be added, are in two senses. For the privation too is in a way form. But\nwhether in unqualified coming to be there is privation, i.e. a contrary to what comes to be, we must\nconsider later.\n\nWe have distinguished, then, the different ways in which the term 'nature' is used.\nThe next point to consider is how the mathematician differs from the physicist. Obviously physical bodies\ncontain surfaces and volumes, lines and points, and these are the subject-matter of mathematics.\nFurther, is astronomy different from physics or a department of it? It seems absurd that the physicist\nshould be supposed to know the nature of sun or moon, but not to know any of their essential attributes,\nparticularly as the writers on physics obviously do discuss their shape also and whether the earth and the\nworld are spherical or not.\nNow the mathematician, though he too treats of these things, nevertheless does not treat of them as the\nlimits of a physical body; nor does he consider the attributes indicated as the attributes of such bodies.\nThat is why he separates them; for in thought they are separable from motion, and it makes no difference,\nnor does any falsity result, if they are separated. The holders of the theory of Forms do the same, though\nthey are not aware of it; for they separate the objects of physics, which are less separable than those of\nmathematics. This becomes plain if one tries to state in each of the two cases the definitions of the things\nand of their attributes. 'Odd' and 'even', 'straight' and 'curved', and likewise 'number', 'line', and\n'figure', do not involve motion; not so 'flesh' and 'bone' and 'man'-these are defined like 'snub nose',\nnot like 'curved'.\nSimilar evidence is supplied by the more physical of the branches of mathematics, such as optics,\nharmonics, and astronomy. These are in a way the converse of geometry. While geometry investigates\nphysical lines but not qua physical, optics investigates mathematical lines, but qua physical, not qua\nmathematical.\nSince 'nature' has two senses, the form and the matter, we must investigate its objects as we would the\nessence of snubness. That is, such things are neither independent of matter nor can be defined in terms of\nmatter only. Here too indeed one might raise a difficulty. Since there are two natures, with which is the\nphysicist concerned? Or should he investigate the combination of the two? But if the combination of the\ntwo, then also each severally. Does it belong then to the same or to different sciences to know each\nseverally?\nIf we look at the ancients, physics would to be concerned with the matter. (It was only very slightly that\nEmpedocles and Democritus touched on the forms and the essence.)\nBut if on the other hand art imitates nature, and it is the part of the same discipline to know the form and\nthe matter up to a point (e.g. the doctor has a knowledge of health and also of bile and phlegm, in which\nhealth is realized, and the builder both of the form of the house and of the matter, namely that it is bricks\nand beams, and so forth): if this is so, it would be the part of physics also to know nature in both its\nsenses.\nAgain, 'that for the sake of which', or the end, belongs to the same department of knowledge as the\nmeans. But the nature is the end or 'that for the sake of which'. For if a thing undergoes a continuous\nchange and there is a stage which is last, this stage is the end or 'that for the sake of which'. (That is why\n\nthe poet was carried away into making an absurd statement when he said 'he has the end for the sake of\nwhich he was born'. For not every stage that is last claims to be an end, but only that which is best.)\nFor the arts make their material (some simply 'make' it, others make it serviceable), and we use\neverything as if it was there for our sake. (We also are in a sense an end. 'That for the sake of which' has\ntwo senses: the distinction is made in our work On Philosophy.) The arts, therefore, which govern the\nmatter and have knowledge are two, namely the art which uses the product and the art which directs the\nproduction of it. That is why the using art also is in a sense directive; but it differs in that it knows the\nform, whereas the art which is directive as being concerned with production knows the matter. For the\nhelmsman knows and prescribes what sort of form a helm should have, the other from what wood it\nshould be made and by means of what operations. In the products of art, however, we make the material\nwith a view to the function, whereas in the products of nature the matter is there all along.\nAgain, matter is a relative term: to each form there corresponds a special matter. How far then must the\nphysicist know the form or essence? Up to a point, perhaps, as the doctor must know sinew or the smith\nbronze (i.e. until he understands the purpose of each): and the physicist is concerned only with things\nwhose forms are separable indeed, but do not exist apart from matter. Man is begotten by man and by the\nsun as well. The mode of existence and essence of the separable it is the business of the primary type of\nphilosophy to define.\nNow that we have established these distinctions, we must proceed to consider causes, their character and\nnumber. Knowledge is the object of our inquiry, and men do not think they know a thing till they have\ngrasped the 'why' of (which is to grasp its primary cause). So clearly we too must do this as regards both\ncoming to be and passing away and every kind of physical change, in order that, knowing their principles,\nwe may try to refer to these principles each of our problems.\nIn one sense, then, (1) that out of which a thing comes to be and which persists, is called 'cause', e.g. the\nbronze of the statue, the silver of the bowl, and the genera of which the bronze and the silver are species.\nIn another sense (2) the form or the archetype, i.e. the statement of the essence, and its genera, are called\n'causes' (e.g. of the octave the relation of 2:1, and generally number), and the parts in the definition.\nAgain (3) the primary source of the change or coming to rest; e.g. the man who gave advice is a cause, the\nfather is cause of the child, and generally what makes of what is made and what causes change of what is\nchanged.\nAgain (4) in the sense of end or 'that for the sake of which' a thing is done, e.g. health is the cause of\nwalking about. ('Why is he walking about?' we say. 'To be healthy', and, having said that, we think we\nhave assigned the cause.) The same is true also of all the intermediate steps which are brought about\nthrough the action of something else as means towards the end, e.g. reduction of flesh, purging, drugs, or\nsurgical instruments are means towards health. All these things are 'for the sake of' the end, though they\ndiffer from one another in that some are activities, others instruments.\nThis then perhaps exhausts the number of ways in which the term 'cause' is used.\n\nAs the word has several senses, it follows that there are several causes of the same thing not merely in\nvirtue of a concomitant attribute), e.g. both the art of the sculptor and the bronze are causes of the statue.\nThese are causes of the statue qua statue, not in virtue of anything else that it may be-only not in the same\nway, the one being the material cause, the other the cause whence the motion comes. Some things cause\neach other reciprocally, e.g. hard work causes fitness and vice versa, but again not in the same way, but\nthe one as end, the other as the origin of change. Further the same thing is the cause of contrary results.\nFor that which by its presence brings about one result is sometimes blamed for bringing about the\ncontrary by its absence. Thus we ascribe the wreck of a ship to the absence of the pilot whose presence\nwas the cause of its safety.\nAll the causes now mentioned fall into four familiar divisions. The letters are the causes of syllables, the\nmaterial of artificial products, fire, &c., of bodies, the parts of the whole, and the premisses of the\nconclusion, in the sense of 'that from which'. Of these pairs the one set are causes in the sense of\nsubstratum, e.g. the parts, the other set in the sense of essence-the whole and the combination and the\nform. But the seed and the doctor and the adviser, and generally the maker, are all sources whence the\nchange or stationariness originates, while the others are causes in the sense of the end or the good of the\nrest; for 'that for the sake of which' means what is best and the end of the things that lead up to it.\n(Whether we say the 'good itself or the 'apparent good' makes no difference.)\nSuch then is the number and nature of the kinds of cause.\nNow the modes of causation are many, though when brought under heads they too can be reduced in\nnumber. For 'cause' is used in many senses and even within the same kind one may be prior to another\n(e.g. the doctor and the expert are causes of health, the relation 2:1 and number of the octave), and always\nwhat is inclusive to what is particular. Another mode of causation is the incidental and its genera, e.g. in\none way 'Polyclitus', in another 'sculptor' is the cause of a statue, because 'being Polyclitus' and\n'sculptor' are incidentally conjoined. Also the classes in which the incidental attribute is included; thus 'a\nman' could be said to be the cause of a statue or, generally, 'a living creature'. An incidental attribute too\nmay be more or less remote, e.g. suppose that 'a pale man' or 'a musical man' were said to be the cause\nof the statue.\nAll causes, both proper and incidental, may be spoken of either as potential or as actual; e.g. the cause of\na house being built is either 'house-builder' or 'house-builder building'.\nSimilar distinctions can be made in the things of which the causes are causes, e.g. of 'this statue' or of\n'statue' or of 'image' generally, of 'this bronze' or of 'bronze' or of 'material' generally. So too with the\nincidental attributes. Again we may use a complex expression for either and say, e.g. neither 'Polyclitus'\nnor 'sculptor' but 'Polyclitus, sculptor'.\nAll these various uses, however, come to six in number, under each of which again the usage is twofold.\nCause means either what is particular or a genus, or an incidental attribute or a genus of that, and these\neither as a complex or each by itself; and all six either as actual or as potential. The difference is this\nmuch, that causes which are actually at work and particular exist and cease to exist simultaneously with\ntheir effect, e.g. this healing person with this being-healed person and that house-building man with that\nbeing-built house; but this is not always true of potential causes -- the house and the housebuilder do not\npass away simultaneously.\n\nIn investigating the cause of each thing it is always necessary to seek what is most precise (as also in\nother things): thus man builds because he is a builder, and a builder builds in virtue of his art of building.\nThis last cause then is prior: and so generally.\nFurther, generic effects should be assigned to generic causes, particular effects to particular causes, e.g.\nstatue to sculptor, this statue to this sculptor; and powers are relative to possible effects, actually operating\ncauses to things which are actually being effected.\nThis must suffice for our account of the number of causes and the modes of causation.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\nSTS.003 The Rise of Modern Science\nFall 2010\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

      "content": "Antoine Lavoisier (1743-1794). \"Preface of the Author\" from Elements of Chemistry.1789.\nTranslation by Robert Kerr (Edinburgh, 1790).\nBased on Dover facsimile edition (1965), pp. xiii-xxxvii.\n***\nWhen I began the following Work, my only object was to extend and explain more fully the Memoir\nwhich I read at the public meeting of the Academy of Science in the month of April 1787, on the\nnecessity of reforming and completing the Nomenclature of Chemistry. While engaged in this\nemployment, I perceived, better than I had ever done before, the justice of the following maxims of the\nAbbe de Condillac, in his System of Logic, and some other of his works.\n\"We think only through the medium of words. --Languages are true analytical methods. --Algebra, which\nis adapted to its purpose in every species of expression, in the most simple, most exact, and best manner\npossible, is at the same time a language and an analytical method. --The art of reasoning is nothing more\nthan a language well arranged.\"\nThus, while I thought myself employed only in forming a Nomenclature, and while I proposed to myself\nnothing more than to improve the chemical language, my work transformed itself by degrees, without my\nbeing able to prevent it, into a treatise upon the Elements of Chemistry.\nThe impossibility of separating the nomenclature of a science from the science itself, is owing to this, that\nevery branch of physical science must consist of three things; the series of facts which are the objects of\nthe science, the ideas which represent these facts, and the words by which these ideas are expressed. Like\nthree impressions of the same seal, the word ought to produce the idea, and the idea to be a picture of the\nfact. And, as ideas are preserved and communicated by means of words, it necessarily follows that we\ncannot improve the language of any science without at the same time improving the science itself; neither\ncan we, on the other hand, improve a science, without improving the language or nomenclature which\nbelongs to it. However certain the facts of any science may be, and, however just the ideas we may have\nformed of these facts, we can only communicate false impressions to others, while we want words by\nwhich these may be properly expressed.\nTo those who will consider it with attention, the first part of this treatise will afford frequent proofs of the\ntruth of the above observations. But as, in the conduct of my work, I have been obliged to observe an\norder of arrangement essentially differing from what has been adopted in any other chemical work yet\npublished, it is proper that I should explain the motives which have led me to do so.\nIt is a maxim universally admitted in geometry, and indeed in every branch of knowledge, that, in the\nprogress of investigation, we should proceed from known facts to what is unknown. In early infancy, our\nideas spring from our wants; the sensation of want excites the idea of the object by which it is to be\ngratified. In this manner, from a series of sensations, observations, and analyses, a successive train of\nideas arises, so linked together, that an attentive observer may trace back to a certain point the order and\nconnection of the whole sum of human knowledge.\nWhen we begin the study of any science, we are in a situation, respecting that science, similar to that of\nchildren; and the course by which we have to advance is precisely the same which Nature follows in the\nformation of their ideas. In a child, the idea is merely an effect produced by a sensation; and, in the same\n\nmanner, in commencing the study of a physical science, we ought to form no idea but what is a necessary\nconsequence, and immediate effect, of an experiment or observation. Besides, he that enters upon the\ncareer of science, is in a less advantageous situation than a child who is acquiring his first ideas. To the\nchild, Nature gives various means of rectifying any mistakes he may commit respecting the salutary or\nhurtful qualities of the objects which surround him. On every occasion his judgments are corrected by\nexperience; want and pain are the necessary consequences arising from false judgment; gratification and\npleasure are produced by judging aright. Under such masters, we cannot fail to become well informed;\nand we soon learn to reason justly, when want and pain are the necessary consequences of a contrary\nconduct.\nIn the study and practice of the sciences it is quite different; the false judgments we form neither affect\nour existence nor our welfare; and we are not forced by any physical necessity to correct them.\nImagination, on the contrary, which is ever wandering beyond the bounds of truth, joined to self-love and\nthat self-confidence we are so apt to indulge, prompt us to draw conclusions which are not immediately\nderived from facts; so that we become in some measure interested in deceiving ourselves. Hence it is by\nno means to be wondered, that, in the science of physics in general, men have often made suppositions,\ninstead of forming conclusions. These suppositions, handed down from one age to another, acquire\nadditional weight from the authorities by which they are supported, till at last they are received, even by\nmen of genius, as fundamental truths.\nThe only method of preventing such errors from taking place, and of correcting them when formed, is to\nrestrain and simplify our reasoning as much as possible. This depends entirely upon ourselves, and the\nneglect of it is the only source of our mistakes. We must trust to nothing but facts: These are presented to\nus by Nature, and cannot deceive. We ought, in every instance, to submit our reasoning to the test of\nexperiment, and never to search for truth but by the natural road of experiment and observation. Thus\nmathematicians obtain the solution of a problem by the mere arrangement of data, and by reducing their\nreasoning to such simple steps, to conclusions so very obvious, as never to lose sight of the evidence\nwhich guides them.\nThoroughly convinced of these truths, I have imposed upon myself, as a law, never to advance but from\nwhat is known to what is unknown; never to form any conclusion which is not an immediate consequence\nnecessarily flowing from observation and experiment; and always to arrange the fact, and the conclusions\nwhich are drawn from them, in such an order as shall render it most easy for beginners in the study of\nchemistry thoroughly to understand them. Hence I have been obliged to depart from the usual order of\ncourses of lectures and of treatises upon chemistry, which always assume the first principles of the\nscience, as known, when the pupil or the reader should never be supposed to know them till they have\nbeen explained in subsequent lessons. In almost every instance, these begin by treating of the elements of\nmatter, and by explaining the table of affinities, without considering, that, in so doing, they must bring the\nprincipal phenomena of chemistry into view at the very outset: They make use of terms which have not\nbeen defined, and suppose the science to be understood by the very persons they are only beginning to\nteach. It ought likewise to be considered, that very little of chemistry can be learned in a first course,\nwhich is hardly sufficient to make the language of the science familiar to the ears, or the apparatus\nfamiliar to the eyes. It is almost impossible to become a chemist in less than three or four years of\nconstant application.\n\nThese inconveniencies are occasioned not so much by the nature of the subject, as by the method of\nteaching it; and, to avoid them, I was chiefly induced to adopt a new arrangement of chemistry, which\nappeared to me more consonant to the order of Nature. I acknowledge, however, that in thus\nendeavouring to avoid difficulties of one kind, I have found myself involved in others of a different\nspecies, some of which I have not been able to remove; but I am persuaded, that such as remain do not\narise from the nature of the order I have adopted, but are rather consequences of the imperfection under\nwhich chemistry still labours. This science still has many chasms, which interrupt the series of facts, and\noften render it extremely difficult to reconcile them with each other: It has not, like the elements of\ngeometry, the advantage of being a complete science, the parts of which are all closely connected\ntogether: Its actual progress, however, is so rapid, and the facts, under the modern doctrine, have assumed\nso happy an arrangement, that we have ground to hope, even in our own times, to see it approach near to\nthe highest state of perfection of which it is susceptible.\nThe rigorous law from which I have never deviated, of forming no conclusions which are not fully\nwarranted by experiment, and of never supplying the absence of facts, has prevented me from\ncomprehending in this work the branch of chemistry which treats of affinities, although it is perhaps the\nbest calculated of any part of chemistry for being reduced into a completely systematic body. Messrs\nGeoffroy, Gellert, Bergman, Scheele, De Morveau, Kirwan, and many others, have collected a number of\nparticular facts upon this subject, which only wait for a proper arrangement; but the principal data are still\nwanting, or, at least, those we have are either not sufficiently defined, or not sufficiently proved, to\nbecome the foundation upon which to build so very important a branch of chemistry. This science of\naffinities, or elective attractions, holds the same place with regard to the other branches of chemistry, as\nthe higher or transcendental geometry does with respect to the simpler and elementary part; and I thought\nit improper to involve those simple and plain elements, which I flatter myself the greatest part of my\nreaders will easily understand, in the obscurities and difficulties which still attend that other very useful\nand necessary branch of chemical science.\nPerhaps a sentiment of self-love may, without my perceiving it, have given additional force to these\nreflections. Mr de Morveau is at present engaged in publishing the article Affinity in the Methodical\nEncyclopedia; and I had more reasons than one to decline entering upon a work in which he is employed.\nIt will, no doubt, be a matter of surprise, that in a treatise upon the elements of chemistry, there should be\nno chapter on the constituent and elementary parts of matter; but I shall take occasion, in this place, to\nremark, that the fondness for reducing all the bodies in nature to three or four elements, proceeds from a\nprejudice which has descended to us from the Greek Philosophers. The notion of four elements, which, by\nthe variety of their proportions, compose all the known substances in nature, is a mere hypothesis,\nassumed long before the first principles of experimental philosophy or of chemistry had any existence. In\nthose days, without possessing facts, they framed systems; while we, who have collected facts, seem\ndetermined to reject them, when they do not agree with or prejudices. The authority of these fathers of\nhuman philosophy still carry great weight, and there is reason to fear that it will even bear hard upon\ngenerations yet to come.\nIt is very remarkable, that, notwithstanding of the number of philosophical chemists who have supported\nthe doctrine of the four elements, there is not one who has not been led by the evidence of facts to admit a\ngreater number of elements into their theory. The first chemists that wrote after the revival of letters,\n\nconsidered sulphur and salt as elementary substances entering into the composition of a great number of\nsubstances; hence, instead of four, they admitted the existence of six elements. Beccher assumes the\nexistence of three kinds of earth, from the combination of which, in different proportions, he supposed all\nthe varieties of metallic substances to be produced. Stahl gave a new modification to this system; and\nsucceeding chemists have taken the liberty to make or to imagine changes and additions of a similar\nnature. All these chemists were carried along by the influence of the genius of the age in which they lived,\nwhich contented itself with assertions without proofs; or, at least, often admitted as proofs the slightest\ndegrees of probability, unsupported by that strictly rigorous analysis required by modern philosophy.\nAll that can be said upon the number and nature of elements is, in my opinion, confined to discussions\nentirely of a metaphysical nature. The subject only furnishes us with indefinite problems, which may be\nsolved in a thousand different ways, not one of which, in all probability, is consistent with nature. I shall\ntherefore only add upon this subject, that if, by the term elements, we mean to express those simple and\nindivisible atoms of which matter is composed, it is extremely probable we know nothing at all about\nthem; but, if we apply the term elements, or principles of bodies, to express our idea of the last point\nwhich analysis is capable or reaching, we must admit, as elements, all the substances into which we are\ncapable, by any means, to reduce bodies by decomposition. Not that we are entitled to affirm, that these\nsubstances we consider as simple may not be compounded of two, or even of a greater number of\nprinciples; but, since these principles cannot be separated, or rather since we have not hitherto discovered\nthe means of separating them, they act with regard to us as simple substances, and we ought never to\nsuppose them compounded until experiment and observation has proved them to be so.\nThe foregoing reflections upon the progress of chemical ideas naturally apply to the words by which these\nideas are to be expressed. Guided by the work which, in the year 1787, Messrs de Morveau, Berthollet, de\nFourcroy, and I composed upon the Nomenclature of Chemistry, I have endeavoured, as much as\npossible, to denominate simple bodies by simple terms, and I was naturally led to name these first. It will\nbe recollected, that we were obliged to retain that name of any substance by which it had been long\nknown in the world, and that in two cases only we took the liberty of making alterations; first, in the case\nof those which were but newly discovered, and had not yet obtained names, or at least which had been\nknown but for a short time, and the names of which had not yet received the sanction of the public; and,\nsecondly, when the names which had been adopted, whether by the ancients or the moderns, appeared to\nus to express evidently false ideas, when they confounded the substances, to which they were applied,\nwith others possessed of different, or perhaps opposite qualities. We made no scruple, in this case, of\nsubstituting other names in their room, and the greatest number of these were borrowed from the Greek\nlanguage. We endeavoured to frame them in such a manner as to express the most general and the most\ncharacteristic quality of the substances; and this was attended with the additional advantage both of\nassisting the memory of beginners, who find it difficult to remember a new word which has no meaning,\nand of accustoming them early to admit no word without connecting with it some determinate idea.\nTo those bodies which are formed by the union of several simple substances we gave new names,\ncompounded in such a manner as the nature of the substances directed; but, as the number of double\ncombinations is already very considerable, the only method by which we could avoid confusion, was to\ndivide them into classes. In the natural order of ideas, the name of the class or genus is that which\nexpresses a quality common to a great number of individuals: The name of the species, on the contrary,\nexpresses a quality peculiar to certain individuals only.\n\nThese distinctions are not, as some may imagine, merely metaphysical, but are established by Nature. \"A\nchild,\" says the Abbe de Condillac, \"is taught to give the name tree to the first one which is pointed out to\nhim. The next one he sees presents the same idea, and he gives it the same name. This he does likewise to\na third and a fourth, till at last the word tree, which he first applied to an individual, comes to be\nemployed by him as the name of a class or a genus, an abstract idea, which comprehends all trees in\ngeneral. But, when he learns that all trees serve not the same purpose, that they do not all produce the\nsame kind of fruit, he will soon learn to distinguish them by specific and particular names.\" This is the\nlogic of all the sciences, and is naturally applied of chemistry.\nThe acids, for example, are compounded of two substances, of the order of those which we consider as\nsimple; the one constitutes acidity, and is common to all acids, and, from this substance, the name of the\nclass or the genus ought to be taken; the other is peculiar to each acid, and distinguishes it from the rest,\nand from this substance is to be taken the name of the species. But, in the greatest number of acids, the\ntwo constituent elements, the acidifying principle, and that which it acidifies, may exist in different\nproportions, constituting all the possible points of equilibrium or of saturation. This is the case in the\nsulphuric and the sulphurous acids; and these two states of the same acid we have marked by varying the\ntermination of the specific name.\nMetallic substances which have been exposed to the joint action of the air and of fire, lose their metallic\nlustre, increase in weight, and assume an earthy appearance. In this state, like the acids, they are\ncompounded of a principle which is common to all, and one which is peculiar to each. In the same way,\ntherefore, we have thought proper to class them under a generic name, derived from the common\nprinciple; for which purpose, we adopted the term oxyd; and we distinguish them from each other by the\nparticular name of the metal to which each belongs.\nCombustible substances, which in acids and metallic oxyds are a specific and particular principle, are\ncapable of becoming, in their turn, common principles of a great number of substances. The sulphurous\ncombinations have been long the only known ones in this kind. Now, however, we know, from the\nexperiments of Messrs Vandermonde, Monge, and Berthollet, that charcoal may be combined with iron,\nand perhaps with several other metals; and that, from this combination, according to the proportions, may\nbe produced steel, plumbago, &c. We know likewise, from the experiments of M. Pelletier, that\nphosphorus may be combined with a great number of metallic substances. These different combinations\nwe have classed under generic names taken from the common substance, with a termination which marks\nthis analogy, specifying them by another name taken from that substance which is proper to each.\nThe nomenclature of bodies compounded of three simple substances was attended with still greater\ndifficulty, not only on account of their number, but, particularly, because we cannot express the nature of\ntheir constituent principles without employing more compound names. In the bodies which form this\nclass, such as the neutral salts, for instance, we had to consider, 1st, The acidifying principle, which is\ncommon to them all; 2d, The acidifiable principle which constitutes their peculiar acid; 3d, The saline,\nearthy, or metallic basis, which determines the particular species of salt. Here we derived the name of\neach class of salts from the name of the acidifiable principle common to all the individuals of that class;\nand distinguished each species by the name of the saline, earthy, or metallic basis, which is peculiar to it.\nA salt, though compounded of the same three principles, may, nevertheless, by the mere difference of\ntheir proportion, be in three different states. The nomenclature we have adopted would have been\n\ndefective, had it not expressed these different states; and this we attained chiefly by changes of\ntermination uniformly applied to the same state of the different salts.\nIn short, we have advanced so far, that from the name alone may be instantly found what the combustible\nsubstance is which enters into any combination; whether that combustible substance be combined with the\nacidifying principle, and in what proportion; what is the state of the acid; with what basis it is united;\nwhether the saturation be exact, or whether the acid or the basis be in excess.\nIt may be easily supposed that it was not possible to attain all these different objects without departing, in\nsome instances, from established custom, and adopting terms which at first sight will appear uncouth and\nbarbarous. But we considered that the ear is soon habituated to new words, especially when they are\nconnected with a general and rational system. The names, besides, which were formerly employed, such\nas powder of algaroth, salt of alembroth, pompholix, phagadenic water, turbith mineral, colcothar, and\nmany others, were neither less barbarous nor less uncommon. It required a great deal of practice, and no\nsmall degree of memory, to recollect the substances to which they were applied, much more to recollect\nthe genus of combination to which they belonged. The names of oil of tartar per deliquium, oil of vitriol,\nbutter of arsenic and of antimony, flowers of zinc, &c. were still more improper, because they suggested\nfalse ideas: For, in the whole mineral kingdom, and particularly in the metallic class, there exists no such\nthing as butters, oils, or flowers; and, in short, the substances to which they give these fallacious names,\nare nothing less than rank poisons.\nWhen we published our essay on the nomenclature of chemistry, we were reproached for having changed\nthe language which was spoken by our masters, which they distinguished by their authority, and handed\ndown to us. But those who reproach us on this account, have forgotten that it was Bergman and Macquer\nthemselves who urged us to make this reformation. In a letter which the learned Professor of Upsala, M.\nBergman, wrote, a short time before he died, to M. de Morveau, he bids him spare no improper names;\nthose who are learned, will always be learned, and those who are ignorant will thus learn sooner.\nThere is an objection to the work which I am going to present to the public, which is perhaps better\nfounded, that I have given no account of the opinion of those who have gone before me; that I have stated\nonly my own opinion, without examining that of others. By this I have been prevented from doing that\njustice to my associates, and more especially to foreign chemists, which I wished to render them. But I\nbeseech the reader to consider, that, if I had filled an elementary work with a multitude of quotations; if I\nhad allowed myself to enter into long dissertations on the history of the science, and the works of those\nwho have studied it, I must have lost sight of the true object I had in view, and produced a work, the\nreading of which must have been extremely tiresome to beginners. It is not to the history of the science, or\nof the human mind, that we are to attend in an elementary treatise: Our only aim ought to be ease and\nperspicuity, and with the utmost care to keep every thing out of view which might draw aside the\nattention of the student; it is a road which we should be continually rendering more smooth, and from\nwhich we should endeavour to remove every obstacle which can occasion delay. The sciences, from their\nown nature, present a sufficient number of difficulties, though we add not those which are foreign to\nthem. But, besides this, chemists will easily perceive, that, in the fist part of my work, I make very little\nuse of any experiments but those which were made by myself: If at any time I have adopted, without\nacknowledgment, the experiments or the opinions of M. Berthollet, M. Fourcroy, M. de la Place, M.\nMonge, or, in general, of any of those whose principles are the same with my own, it is owing to the\n\ncircumstance, that frequent intercourse, and the habit of communicating our ideas, our observations, and\nour way of thinking to each other, has established between us a sort of community of opinions, in which it\nis often difficult for every one to know his own.\nThe remarks I have made on the order which I thought myself obliged to follow in the arrangement of\nproofs and ideas, are to be applied only to the first part of this work. It is the only one which contains the\ngeneral sum of the doctrine I have adopted, and to which I wished to give a form completely elementary.\nThe second part is composed chiefly of tables of the nomenclature of the neutral salts. To these I have\nonly added general explanations, the object of which was to point out the most simple processes for\nobtaining the different kinds of known acids. This part contains nothing which I can call my own, and\npresents only a very short abridgment of the results of these processes, extracted from the works of\ndifferent authors.\nIn the third part, I have given a description, in detail, of all the operations connected with modern\nchemistry. I have long thought that a work of this kind was much wanted, and I am convinced it will not\nbe without use. The method of performing experiments, and particularly those of modern chemistry, is not\nso generally known as it ought to be; and had I, in the different memoirs which I have presented to the\nAcademy, been more particular in the detail of the manipulations of my experiments, it is probable I\nshould have made myself better understood, and the science might have made a more rapid progress. The\norder of the different matters contained in this third part appeared to me to be almost arbitrary; and the\nonly one I have observed was to class together, in each of the chapters of which it is composed, those\noperations which are most connected with one another. I need hardly mention that this part could not be\nborrowed from any other work, and that, in the principal articles it contains, I could not derive assistance\nfrom any thing but the experiments which I have made myself.\nI shall conclude this preface by transcribing, literally, some observations of the Abbe de Condillac, which\nI think describe, with a good deal of truth, the state of chemistry at a period not far distant from our own.\nThese observations were made on a different subject; but they will not, on this account, have less force, if\nthe application of them be thought just.\n\"Instead of applying observation to the things we wished to know, we have chosen rather to imagine\nthem. Advancing from one ill founded supposition to another, we have at last bewildered ourselves\namidst a multitude of errors. These errors becoming prejudices, are, of course, adopted as principles, and\nwe thus bewilder ourselves more and more. The method, too, by which we conduct our reasonings is as\nabsurd; we abuse words which we do not understand, and call this the art of reasoning. When matters\nhave been brought this length, when errors have been thus accumulated, there is but one remedy by which\norder can be restored to the faculty of thinking; this is, to forget all that we have learned, to trace back our\nideas to their source, to follow the train in which they rise, and, as my Lord Bacon says, to frame the\nhuman understanding anew.\n\"This remedy becomes the more difficult in proportion as we think ourselves more learned. Might it not\nbe thought that works which treated of the sciences with the utmost perspicuity, with great precision and\norder, must be understood by every body? The fact is, those who have never studied any thing will\nunderstand them better than those who have studied a great deal, and especially those who have written a\ngreat deal.\"\n\nAt the end of the fifth chapter, the Abbe de Condillac adds: \"But, after all, the sciences have made\nprogress, because philosophers have applied themselves with more attention to observe, and have\ncommunicated to their language that precision and accuracy which they have employed in their\nobservations: In correcting their language they reason better.\"\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\nSTS.003 The Rise of Modern Science\nFall 2010\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

      "content": "Atomic Energy for Military Purposes\nThe Official Report on the Development of the Atomic Bomb Under the Auspices\nof the United States Government\n(The Smyth Report)\nBy Henry De Wolf Smyth\nPublished 1945\nCHAPTER XII: THE WORK ON THE ATOMIC BOMB\nTHE OBJECTIVE\n12.1. The entire purpose of the work described in the preceding chapters was to explore the\npossibility of creating atomic bombs and to produce the concentrated fissionable materials which\nwould be required in such bombs. In the present chapter, the last stage of the work will be\ndescribed - the development at Los Alamos of the atomic bomb itself. As in other parts of the\nproject, there are two phases to be considered: the organization, and the scientific and technical\nwork itself. The organization will be described briefly; the remainder of the chapter will be\ndevoted to the scientific and technical problems. Security considerations prevent a discussion of\nmany of the most important phases of this work.\nHISTORY AND ORGANIZATION\n12.2. The project reorganization that occurred at the beginning of 1942, and the subsequent\ngradual transfer of the work from OSRD auspices to the Manhattan District have been described\nin Chapter V. It will be recalled that the responsibilities of the Metallurgical Laboratory at\nChicago originally included a preliminary study of the physics of the atomic bomb. Some such\nstudies were made in 1941; and early in 1942 G. Breit got various laboratories (see Chapter VI,\nparagraph 6.38) started on the experimental study of problems that had to be solved before\nprogress could be made on bomb design. As has been mentioned in Chapter VI, J. R.\nOppenheimer of the University of California gathered a group together in the summer of 1942\nfor further theoretical investigation and also undertook to coordinate this experimental work.\nThis group was officially under the Metallurgical Laboratory but the theoretical group did most\nof its work at the University of California. By the end of the summer of 1942, when General L.\nR. Groves took charge of the entire project, it was decided to expand the work considerably, and,\nat the earliest possible time, to set up a separate laboratory.\n12.3. In the choice of a site for this atomic-bomb laboratory, the all-important considerations\nwere secrecy and safety. It was therefore decided to establish the laboratory in an isolated\nlocation and to sever unnecessary connection with the outside world.\n12.4. By November 1942 a site had been chosen - at Los Alamos, New Mexico. It was located on\na mesa about 30 miles from Santa Fe. One asset of this site was the availability of considerable\n\narea for proving grounds, but initially the only structures on the site consisted of a handful of\nbuildings which once constituted a small boarding school. There was no laboratory, no library,\nno shop, no adequate power plant. The sole means of approach was a winding mountain road.\nThat the handicaps of the site were overcome to a considerable degree is a tribute to the\nunstinting efforts of the scientific and military personnel.\n12.5. J. R. Oppenheimer has been director of the laboratory from the start. He arrived at the site\nin March 1943, and was soon joined by groups and individuals from Princeton University,\nUniversity of Chicago, University of California, University of Wisconsin, University of\nMinnesota, and elsewhere. With the vigorous support of General L. R. Groves, J. B. Conant, and\nothers, Oppenheimer continued to gather around him scientists of recognized ability, so that the\nend of 1944 found an extraordinary galaxy of scientific stars gathered on this New Mexican\nmesa. The recruiting of junior scientific personnel and technicians was more difficult, since for\nsuch persons the disadvantages of the site were not always counterbalanced by an appreciation of\nthe magnitude of the goal; the use of Special Engineer Detachment personnel improved the\nsituation considerably.\n12.6. Naturally, the task of assembling the necessary apparatus, machines, and equipment was an\nenormous one. Three carloads of apparatus from the Princeton project filled some of the most\nurgent requirements. A cyclotron from Harvard, two Van de Graaff generators from Wisconsin,\nand a Cockcroft-Walton high-voltage device from Illinois soon arrived. As an illustration of the\nspeed with which the laboratory was set up, we may record that the bottom pole piece of the\ncyclotron magnet was not laid until April 14, 1943, yet the first experiment was performed in\nearly July. Other apparatus was acquired in quantity, subsidiary laboratories were built. Today\nthis is probably the best-equipped physics research laboratory in the world.\n12.7. The laboratory was financed under a contract between the Manhattan District and the\nUniversity of California.\nSTATE OF KNOWLEDGE IN APRIL 1943\nGENERAL DISCUSSION OF THE PROBLEM\n12.8. In Chapter II we stated the general conditions required to produce a self-sustaining chain\nreaction. It was pointed out that there are four processes competing for neutrons: (1) the capture\nof neutrons by uranium which results in fission; (2) non-fission capture by uranium; (3) non-\nfission capture by impurities; and (4) escape of neutrons from the system. Therefore the\ncondition for obtaining such a chain reaction is that process (1) shall produce as many new\nneutrons as are consumed or lost in all four of the processes. It was pointed out that (2) may be\nreduced by removal of U-238 or by the use of a lattice and moderator, that (3) may be reduced by\nachieving a high degree of chemical purity, and that (4) may be reduced (relatively) by\nincreasing the size of the system. In our earlier discussions of chain reactions it was always taken\nfor granted that the chain reacting system must not blow up. Now we want to consider how to\nmake it blow up.\n\n12.9. By definition, an explosion is a sudden and violent release of a large amount of energy in a\nsmall region. To produce an efficient explosion in an atomic bomb, the parts of the bomb must\nnot become appreciably separated before a substantial fraction of the available nuclear energy\nhas been released, since expansion leads to increased escape of neutrons from the system and\nthus to premature termination of the chain reaction. Stated differently, the efficiency of the\natomic bomb will depend on the ratio of (a) the speed with which neutrons generated by the first\nfissions get into other nuclei and produce further fission, and (b) the speed with which the bomb\nflies apart. Using known principles of energy generation, temperature and pressure rise, and\nexpansion of solids and vapors, it was possible to estimate the order of magnitude of the time\ninterval between the beginning and end of the nuclear chain reaction. Almost all the technical\ndifficulties of the project come from the extraordinary brevity of this time interval.\n12.10. In earlier chapters we stated that no self-sustaining chain reaction could be produced in a\nblock of pure uranium metal, no matter how large, because of parasitic capture of the neutrons by\nU-238. This conclusion has been borne out by various theoretical calculations and also by direct\nexperiment. For purposes of producing a non-explosive pile, the trick of using a lattice and a\nmoderator suffices - by reducing parasitic capture sufficiently. For purposes of producing an\nexplosive unit, however, it turns out that this process is unsatisfactory on two counts. First, the\nthermal neutrons take so long (so many micro-seconds) to act that only a feeble explosion would\nresult. Second, a pile is ordinarily far too big to be transported. It is therefore necessary to cut\ndown parasitic capture by removing the greater part of the U-238 - or to use plutonium.\n12.11. Naturally, these general principles - and others - had been well established before the Los\nAlamos project was set up.\nCRITICAL SIZE\n12.12. The calculation of the critical size of a chain-reacting unit is a problem that has already\nbeen discussed in connection with piles. Although the calculation is simpler for a homogeneous\nmetal unit than for a lattice, inaccuracies remained in the course of the early work, both because\nof lack of accurate knowledge of constants and because of mathematical difficulties. For\nexample, the scattering, fission, and absorption cross sections of the nuclei involved all vary with\nneutron velocity. The details of such variation were not known experimentally and were difficult\nto take into account in making calculations. By the spring of 1943 several estimates of critical\nsize had been made using various methods of calculation and using the best available nuclear\nconstants, but the limits of error remained large.\nTHE REFLECTOR OR TAMPER\n12.13. In a uranium-graphite chain-reacting pile the critical size may be considerably reduced by\nsurrounding the pile with a layer of graphite, since such an envelope \"reflects\" many neutrons\nback into the pile. A similar envelope can be used to reduce the critical size of the bomb, but\nhere the envelope has an additional role: its very inertia delays the expansion of the reacting\nmaterial. For this reason such an envelope is often called a tamper. Use of a tamper clearly\nmakes for a longer lasting, more energetic, and more efficient explosion. The most effective\ntamper is the one having the highest density; high tensile strength turns out to be unimportant. It\n\nis a fortunate coincidence that materials of high density are also excellent as reflectors of\nneutrons.\nEFFICIENCY\n12.14. As has already been remarked, the bomb tends to fly to bits as the reaction proceeds and\nthis tends to stop the reaction. To calculate how much the bomb has to expand before the\nreaction stops is relatively simple. The calculation of how long this expansion takes and how far\nthe reaction goes in that time is much more difficult.\n12.15. While the effect of a tamper is to increase the efficiency - both by reflecting neutrons and\nby delaying the expansion of the bomb, the effect on the efficiency is not as great as on the\ncritical mass. The reason for this is that the process of reflection is relatively time-consuming and\nmay not occur extensively before the chain reaction is terminated.\nDETONATION AND ASSEMBLY\n12.16. As stated in Chapter II, it is impossible to prevent a chain reaction from occurring when\nthe size exceeds the critical size. For there are always enough neutrons (from cosmic rays, from\nspontaneous fission reactions, or from alpha-particle-induced reactions in impurities) to initiate\nthe chain. Thus until detonation is desired, the bomb must consist of a number of separate pieces\neach one of which is below the critical size either by reason of small size or unfavorable shape.\nTo produce detonation, the parts of the bomb must be brought together rapidly. In the course of\nthis assembly process the chain reaction is likely to start - because of the presence of stray\nneutrons - before the bomb has reached its most compact (most reactive) form. Thereupon the\nexplosion tends to prevent the bomb from reaching that most compact form. Thus it may turn out\nthat the explosion is so inefficient as to be relatively useless. The problem, therefore, is two-fold:\n(1) to reduce the time of assembly to a minimum; and (2) to reduce the number of stray\n(predetonation) neutrons to a minimum.\n12.17. Some consideration was given to the danger of producing a \"dud\" or a detonation so\ninefficient that even the bomb itself would not be completely destroyed. This would, of course,\npresent the enemy with a supply of highly valuable material.\nEFFECTIVENESS\n12.18. In Chapters II and IV it was pointed out that the arnount of energy released was not the\nsole criterion of the value of a bomb. There was no assurance that one uranium bomb releasing\nenergy equal to the energy released by 20,000 tons of TNT would be as effective in producing\nmilitary destruction as, say, 10,000 two-ton bombs. In fact, there were good reasons to believe\nthat the destructive effect per calorie released decreases as the total amount of energy released\nincreases. On the other hand, in atomic bombs the total amount of energy released per kilogram\nof fissionable material (i.e., the efficiency of energy release) increases with the size of the bomb.\nThus the optimum size of the atomic bomb was not easily determined. A tactical aspect that\ncomplicates the matter further is the advantage of simultaneous destruction of a large area of\nenemy territory. In a complete appraisal of the effectiveness of an atomic bomb, attention must\n\nalso be given to effects on morale.1 The bomb is detonated in combat at such a height above the\nground as to give the maximum blast effect against structures, and to disseminate the radioactive\nproducts as a cloud. On account of the height of the explosion practically all the radioactive\nproducts are carried upward in the ascending column of hot air and dispersed harmlessly over a\nwide area. Even in the New Mexico test, where the height of explosion was necessarily low, only\na very small fraction of the radioactivity was deposited immediately below the bomb.\nMETHOD OF ASSEMBLY\n12.19. Since estimates had been made of the speed that would bring together subcritical masses\nof U-235 rapidly enough to avoid predetonation, a good deal of thought had been given to\npractical methods of doing this. The obvious method of very rapidly assembling an atomic bomb\nwas to shoot one part as a projectile in a gun against a second part as a target. The projectile\nmass, projectile speed, and gun caliber required were not far from the range of standard ordnance\npractice, but novel problems were introduced by the importance of achieving sudden and perfect\ncontact between projectile and target, by the use of tampers, and by the requirement of\nportability. None of these technical problems had been studied to any appreciable extent prior to\nthe establishment of the Los Alamos laboratory.\n12.20. It had also been realized that schemes probably might be devised whereby neutron\nabsorbers could be incorporated in the bomb in such a way that they would be rendered less\neffective by the initial stages of the chain reactions. Thus the tendency for the bomb to detonate\nprematurely and inefficiently would be minimized. Such devices for increasing the efficiency of\nthe bomb are called auto-catalytic.\nSUMMARY OF KNOWLEDGE AS OF APRIL 1943\n12.21. In April 1943 the available information of interest in connection with the design of atomic\nbombs was preliminary and inaccurate. Further and extensive theoretical work on critical size,\nefficiency, effect of tamper, method of detonation, and effectiveness was urgently needed.\nMeasurements of the nuclear constants of U-235, plutonium, and tamper material had to be\nextended and improved. In the cases of U-235 and plutonium tentative measurements had to be\nmade using only minute quantities until larger quantities became available.\n12.22. Besides these problems in theoretical and experimental physics, there was a host of\nchemical, metallurgical, and technical problems that had hardly been touched. Examples were\nthe purification and fabrication of U-235 and plutonium, and the fabrication of the tamper.\nFinally, there were problems of instantaneous assembly of the bomb that were staggering in their\ncomplexity.\nTHE WORK OF THE LABORATORY\nINTRODUCTION\n1 The rest of this paragraph is from a War Department release subsequent to the first use of atomic\nbombs against Japan.\n\n12.23. For administrative purposes the scientific staff at Los Alamos was arranged in seven\ndivisions, which have been rearranged at various times. During the spring of 1945 the divisions\nwere: Theoretical Physics Division under H. Bethe, Experimental Nuclear Physics Division\nunder R. R. Wilson, Chemistry and Metallurgy Division under J. W. Kennedy and C. S. Smith,\nOrdnance Division under Capt. W. S. Parsons (USN), Explosives Division under G. B.\nKistiakowsky, Bomb Physics Division under R. F. Bacher, and an Advanced Development\nDivision under E. Ferrni. All the divisions reported to J. R. Oppenheimer, Director of the Los\nAlamos Laboratory who has been assisted in coordinating the research by S. K. Allison since\nDecember 1944. J. Chadwick of England and N. Bohr of Denmark spent a great deal of time at\nLos Alamos and gave invaluable advice. Chadwick was the head of a British delegation which\ncontributed materially to the success of the laboratory. For security reasons, most of the work of\nthe laboratory can be described only in part.\nTHEORETICAL PHYSICS DIVISION\n12.24. There were two considerations that gave unusual importance to the work of the\nTheoretical Physics Division under H. Bethe. The first of these was the necessity for effecting\nsimultaneous development of everything from the fundamental materials to the method of\nputting them to use - all despite the virtual unavailability of the principal materials (U-235 and\nplutonium) and the complete novelty of the processes. The second consideration was the\nimpossibility of producing (as for experimental purposes) a \"small-scale\" atomic explosion by\nmaking use of only a small amount of fissionable material. (No explosion occurs at all unless the\nmass of the fissionable material exceeds the critical mass.) Thus it was necessary to proceed\nfrom data obtained in experiments on infinitesimal quantities of materials and to combine it with\nthe available theories as accurately as possible in order to make estimates as to what would\nhappen in the bomb. Only in this way was it possible to make sensible plans for the other parts of\nthe project, and to make decisions on design and construction without waiting for elaborate\nexperiments on large quantities of material. To take a few examples, theoretical work was\nrequired in making rough determinations of the dimensions of the gun, in guiding the\nmetallurgists in the choice of tamper materials, and in determining the influence of the purity of\nthe fissionable material on the efficiency of the bomb.\n12.25. The determination of the critical size of the bomb was one of the main problems of the\nTheoretical Physics Division. In the course of time, several improvements were made in the\ntheoretical approach whereby it was possible to take account of practically all the complex\nphenomena involved. It was at first considered that the diffusion of neutrons was similar to the\ndiffusion of heat, but this naive analogy had to be forsaken. In the early theoretical work the\nassumptions were made that the neutrons all had the same velocity and all were scattered\nisotropically. A method was thus developed which permitted calculation of the critical size for\nvarious shapes of the fissionable material provided that the mean free path of the neutrons was\nthe same in the tamper material as in the fissionable material. This method was later improved\nfirst by taking account of the angular dependence of the scattering and secondly by allowing for\ndifference in mean free path in core and tamper materials. Still later, means were found of taking\ninto account the effects of the distribution in velocity of the neutrons, the variations of cross\nsections with velocity, and inelastic scattering in the core and tamper materials. Thus it became\npossible to compute critical sizes assuming almost any kind of tamper material.\n\n12.26. The rate at which the neutron density decreases in bomb models which are smaller than\nthe critical size can be calculated, and all the variables mentioned above can be taken into\naccount. The rate of approach to the critical condition as the projectile part of the bomb moves\ntoward the target part of the bomb has been studied by theoretical methods. Furthermore, the best\ndistribution of fissionable material in projectile and target was determined by theoretical studies.\n12.27. Techniques were developed for dealing with set-ups in which the number of neutrons is so\nsmall that a careful statistical analysis must be made of the effects of the neutrons. The most\nimportant problem in this connection was the determination of the probability that, when a bomb\nis larger than critical size, a stray neutron will start a continuing chain reaction. A related\nproblem was the determination of the magnitude of the fluctuations in neutron density in a bomb\nwhose size is close to the critical size. By the summer of 1945 many such calculations had been\nchecked by experiments.\n12.28. A great deal of theoretical work was done on the equation of state of matter at the high\ntemperatures and pressures to be expected in the exploding atomic bombs. The expansion of the\nvarious constituent parts of the bomb during and after the moment of chain reaction has been\ncalculated. The effects of radiation have been investigated in considerable detail.\n12.29. Having calculated the energy that is released in the explosion of an atomic bomb, one\nnaturally wants to estimate the military damage that will be produced. This involves analysis of\nthe shock waves in air and in earth, the determination of the effectiveness of a detonation\nbeneath the surface of the ocean, etc.\n12.30. In addition to all the work mentioned above, a considerable amount of work was done in\nevaluating preliminary experiments. Thus an analysis was made of the back-scattering of\nneutrons by the various tamper materials proposed. An analysis was also made of the results of\nexperiments on the multiplication of neutrons in subcritical amounts of fissionable material.\nEXPERIMENTAL NUCLEAR PHYSICS DIVISION\n12.31. The experiments performed by the Experimental Nuclear Physics group at Los Alamos\nwere of two kinds: \"differential\" experiments as for determining the cross section for fission of a\nspecific isotope by neutrons of a specific velocity, and \"integral\" experiments as for determining\nthe average scattering of fission neutrons from an actual tamper.\n12.32. Many nuclear constants had already been determined at the University of Chicago\nMetallurgical Laboratory and elsewhere, but a number of important constants were still\nundetermined - especially those involving high neutron velocities. Some of the outstanding\nquestions were the following:\n1. What are the fission cross sections of U-234, U-235, U-238 Pu-239, etc.? How do they vary\nwith neutron velocity?\n2. What are the elastic scattering cross sections for the same nuclei (also for nuclei of tamper\nmaterials)? How do they vary with neutron velocity?\n\n3. What are the inelastic cross sections for the nuclei referred to above?\n4. What are the absorption cross sections for processes other than fission?5. How many neutrons\nare emitted per fission in the case of each of the nuclei referred to above?\n6. What is the full explanation of the fact that the number of neutrons emitted per fission is not a\nwhole number?\n7. What is the initial energy of the neutrons produced by fission?\n8. Does the number or energy of such neutrons vary with the speed of the incident neutrons?\n9. Are fission neutrons emitted immediately?\n10. What is the probability of spontaneous fission of the various fissionable nuclei?\n12.33. In addition to attempting to find the answers to these questions the Los Alamos\nExperimental Nuclear Physics Division investigated many problems of great scientific interest\nwhich were expected to play a role in their final device. Whether or not this turned out to be the\ncase, the store of knowledge thus accumulated by the Division forms an integral and invaluable\npart of all thinking on nuclear problems.\n12.34. Experimental Methods. The earlier chapters contain little or no discussion of experimental\ntechniques except those for the observing of fast (charged) particles (See Appendix 1.). To obtain\nanswers to the ten questions posed above, we should like to be able to:\n(1) determine the number of neutrons of any given energy;\n(2) produce neutrons of any desired energy;\n(3) determine the angles of deflection of scattered neutrons;\n(4) determine the number of fissions occurring;\n(5) detect other consequences of neutron absorption, e.g., artificial radioactivity.\nWe shall indicate briefly how such observations are made.\n12.35. Detection of Neutrons. There are three ways in which neutrons can be detected: by the\nionization produced by light atomic nuclei driven forward at high speeds by elastic collisions\nwith neutrons, by the radioactive disintegration of unstable nuclei formed by the absorption of\nneutrons, and by fission resulting from neutron absorption. All three processes lead to the\nproduction of ions and the resulting ionization may be detected using electroscopes, ionization\nchambers, Geiger-Muller counters, Wilson cloud chambers, tracks in photographic emulsion, etc.\n\n12.36. While the mere detection of neutrons is not difficult, the measurement of the neutron\nvelocities is decidedly more so. The Wilson cloud chamber method and the photographic\nemulsion method give the most direct results but are tedious to apply. More often various\ncombinations of selective absorbers are used. Thus, for example, if a foil known to absorb\nneutrons of only one particular range of energies is inserted in the path of the neutrons and is\nthen removed, its degree of radioactivity is presumably proportional to the number of neutrons in\nthe particular energy range concerned. Another scheme is to study the induced radioactivity\nknown to be produced only by neutrons whose energy lies above a certain threshold.\n12.37. One elegant scheme for studying the effects of neutrons of a single, arbitrarily-selected\nvelocity is the \"time of flight\" method. In this method a neutron source is modulated, i.e., the\nsource is made to emit neutrons in short \"bursts\" or \"pulses.\" In each pulse there are a great many\nneutrons - of a very wide range of velocities. The target material and the detector are situated a\nconsiderable distance from the source (several feet or yards from it). The detector is \"modulated\"\nalso, and with the same periodicity. The timing or phasing is made such that the detector is\nresponsive only for a short interval beginning a certain time after the pulse of neutrons leaves the\nsource. Thus any effects recorded by the detector (e.g., fissions in a layer of uranium deposited\non an inner surface of an ionization chamber) are the result only of neutrons that arrive just at the\nmoment of responsivity and therefore have travelled from the source in a certain time interval. In\nother words, the measured effects are due only to the neutrons having the appropriate velocity.\n12.38. Production of Neutrons. All neutrons are produced as the result of nuclear reactions, and\ntheir initial speed depends on the energy balance of the particular reaction. If the reaction is\nendothermic, that is, if the total mass of the resultant particles is greater than that of the initial\nparticles, the reaction does not occur unless the bombarding particle has more than the\n\"threshold\" kinetic energy. At higher bombarding energies the kinetic energy of the resulting\nparticles, specifically of the neutrons, goes up with the increase of kinetic energy of the\nbombarding particle above the threshold value. Thus the Li7(p, n)Be7 reaction absorbs 1.6 Mev\nenergy since the product particles are heavier than the initial particles. Any further energy of the\nincident protons goes into kinetic energy of the products so that the maximum speed of the\nneutrons produced goes up with the speed of the incident protons. However, to get neutrons of a\nnarrow range of speed, a thin target must be used, the neutrons must all come off at the same\nangle, and the protons must all strike the target with the same speed.\n12.39. Although the same energy and momentum conservation laws apply to exothermic nuclear\nreactions, the energy release is usually large compared to the kinetic energy of the bombarding\nparticles and therefore essentially determines the neutron speed. Often there are several ranges of\nspeed from the same reaction. There are some reactions that produce very high energy neutrons\n(nearly 15 Mev).\n12.40. Since there is a limited number of nuclear reactions usable for neutron sources, there are\nonly certain ranges of neutron speeds that can be produced originally. There is no difficulty\nabout slowing down neutrons, but it is impossible to slow them down uniformly, that is, without\nspreading out the velocity distribution. The most effective slowing-down scheme is the use of a\nmoderator, as in the graphite pile; in fact, the pile itself is an excellent source of thermal (i.e.,\nvery low speed) or nearly thermal neutrons.\n\n12.41. Determination of Angles of Deflection. The difficulties in measuring the angles of\ndeflection of neutrons are largely of intensity and interpretation. The number of neutrons\nscattered in a particular direction may be relatively small, and the \"scattered\" neutrons nearly\nalways include many strays not coming from the intended target.\n12.42. Determination of Number of Fissions. The determination of the number of fissions which\nare produced by neutrons or occur spontaneously is relatively simple. Ionization chambers,\ncounter tubes, and many other types of detectors can be used.\n12.43. Detection of Products of Capture of Neutrons. Often it is desirable to find in detail what\nhas happened to neutrons that are absorbed but have not produced fission, e.g., resonance or\n\"radiative\" capture of neutrons by U-238 to form U-239 which leads to the production of\nplutonium. Such studies usually involve a combination of microchemical separations and\nradioactivity analyses.\n12.44. Some Experiments on Nuclear Constants. By the time that the Los Alamos laboratory had\nbeen established, a large amount of work had been done on the effects of slow neutrons on the\nmaterials then available. For example, the thermal-neutron fission cross section of natural\nuranium had been evaluated, and similarly for the separated isotopes of uranium and for\nplutonium. Some data on high-speed-neutron fission cross sections had been published, and\nadditional information was available in project laboratories. To extend and improve such data,\nLos Alamos perfected the use of the Van de Graaff generator for the Li7(p, n)Be7 reaction, so as\nto produce neutrons of any desired energy lying in the range from 3,000 electron volts to two\nmillion electron volts. Success was also achieved in modulating the cyclotron beam and\ndeveloping the neutron time-of-flight method to produce effects of many speed intervals at once.\nSpecial methods were devised for filling in the gaps in neutron energy range. Particularly\nimportant was the refinement of measurement made possible as greater quantities of U-235, U\n238 and plutonium began to be received. On the whole, the value of the cross section for fission\nas a function of neutron energy from practically zero electron volts to three million electron volts\nis now fairly well known for these materials.\n12.45. Some Integral Experiments. Two \"integral experiments\" (experiments on assembled or\nintegrated systems comprising fissionable material, reflector, and perhaps moderator also) may\nbe described. In the first of these integral experiments a chain reacting system was constructed\nwhich included a relatively large amount of U-235 in liquid solution. It was designed to operate\nat a very low power level, and it had no cooling system. Its purpose was to provide verification\nof the effects predicted for reacting systems containing enriched U-235. The results were very\nnearly as expected.\n12.46. The second integral experiment was carried out on a pile containing a mixture of uranium\nand a hydrogenous moderator. In this first form, the pile was thus a slow-neutron chain reacting\npile. The pile was then rebuilt using less hydrogen. In this version of the pile, fast-neutron fission\nbecame important. The pile was rebuilt several more times, less hydrogen being used each time.\nBy such a series of reconstructions, the reaction character was successively altered, so that\nthermal neutron fission became less and less important while fast neutron fission became more\nand more important - approaching the conditions to be found in the bomb.\n\n12.47. Summary of Results on Nuclear Physics. The nuclear constants of U-235, U-238, and\nplutonium have been measured with a reasonable degree of accuracy over the range of neutron\nenergies from thermal to three million electron volts. In other words, questions 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5\nof the ten questions posed at the beginning of this section have been answered. The fission\nspectrum (question 7) for U-235 and Pu-239 is reasonably well known. Spontaneous fission\n(question 10) has been studied for several types of nuclei. Preliminary results on questions 6, 8,\nand 9, involving details of the fission process, have been obtained.\nCHEMISTRY AND METALLURGY DIVISION\n12.48. The Chemistry and Metallurgy Division of the Los Alamos Laboratory was under the\njoint direction of J. W. Kennedy and C. S. Smith. It was responsible for final purification of the\nenriched fissionable materials, for fabrication of the bomb core, tamper, etc., and for various\nother matters. In all this division's work on enriched fissionable materials especial care had to be\ntaken not to lose any appreciable amounts of the materials which are worth much more than\ngold. Thus the procedures already well-established at Chicago and elsewhere for purifying and\nfabricating natural uranium were often not satisfactory for handling highly-enriched samples of\nU-235.\nORDNANCE, EXPLOSIVES, AND BOMB PHYSICS DIVISIONS\n12.49. The above account of the work of the Theoretical Physics, Experimental Nuclear Physics,\nand Chemistry and Metallurgy Divisions is very incomplete because important aspects of this\nwork cannot be discussed for reasons of security. For the same reasons none of the work of the\nOrdnance, Explosives, and Bomb Physics Divisions can be discussed at all.\nSUMMARY\n12.50. In the spring of 1943 an entirely new laboratory was established at Los Alamos, New\nMexico, under J. R. Oppenheimer for the purpose of investigating the design and construction of\nthe atomic bomb, from the stage of receipt of U-235 or plutonium to the stage of use of the\nbomb. The new laboratory improved the theoretical treatment of design and performance\nproblems, refined and extended the measurements of the nuclear constants involved, developed\nmethods of purifying the materials to be used, and, finally, designed and constructed operable\natomic bombs.\n\nCHAPTER XIII: GENERAL SUMMARY\nPRESENT OVERALL STATUS\n13.1. As the result of the labors of the Manhattan District organization in Washington and in\nTennessee, of the scientific groups at Berkeley, Chicago, Columbia, Los Alamos, and else-\nwhere, of the industrial groups at Clinton, Hanford, and many other places, the end of June 1945\nfinds us expecting from day to day to hear of the explosion of the first atomic bomb devised by\nnan. All the problems are believed to have been solved at least well enough to make a bomb\npracticable. A sustained neutron chain reaction resulting from nuclear fission has been demon-\nstrated; the conditions necessary to cause such a reaction to occur explosively have been\nestablished and can be achieved; production plants of several different types are in operation,\nbuilding up a stock pile of the explosive material. Although we do not know when the first\nexplosion will occur nor how effective it will be, announcement of its occurrence will precede\nthe publication of this report. Even if the first attempt is relatively ineffective, there is little doubt\nthat later efforts will be highly effective; the devastation from a single bomb is expected to be\ncomparable to that of a major air raid by usual methods.\n13.2. A weapon has been developed that is potentially destructive beyond the wildest nightmares\nof the imagination; a weapon so ideally suited to sudden unannounced attack that a country's\nmajor cities might be destroyed overnight by an ostensibly friendly power. This weapon has been\ncreated not by the devilish nspiration of some warped genius but by the arduous labor of\nthousands of normal men and women working for the safety of their country. Many of the\nprinciples that have been used were well known to the international scientific world in 1940. To\ndevelop the necessary industrial processes from these principles has been costly in time, effort,\nand money, but the processes which we selected for serious effort have worked and several that\nwe have not chosen could probably be made to work. We have an initial advantage in time\nbecause, so far as we know, other countries have not been able to carry out parallel develop-\nments during the war period. We also have a general advantage in scientific and particularly in\nindustrial strength, but such an advantage can easily be thrown away.\n13.3. Before the surrender of Germany there was always a chance that German scientists and\nengineers might be developing atomic bombs which would be sufficiently effective to alter the\ncourse of the war. There was therefore no choice but to work on them in this country. Initially\nmany scientists could and did hope that some principle would emerge which would prove that\natomic bombs were inherently impossible. This hope has faded gradually; fortunately in the same\nperiod the magnitude of the necessary industrial effort has been demonstrated so that the fear of\nGerman success weakened even before the end came. By the same token, most of us are certain\nthat the Japanese cannot develop and use this weapon effectively.\nPROGNOSTICATION\n\n13.4. As to the future, one may guess that technical developments will take place along two lines.\nFrom the military point of view it is reasonably certain that there will be improvements both in\nthe processes of producing fissionable material and in its use. It is conceivable that totally\ndifferent methods may be discovered for converting matter into energy since it is to be remem\nbered that the energy released in uranium fission corresponds to the utilization of only about one-\ntenth of one per cent of its mass. Should a scheme be devised for converting to energy even as\nmuch as a few percent of the matter of some common material, civilization would have the\nmeans to commit suicide at will.\n13.5. The possible uses of nuclear energy are not all destructive, and the second direction in\nwhich technical development can be expected is along the paths of peace. In the fall of 1944\nGeneral Groves appointed a committee to look into these possibilities as well as those of military\nsignificance. This committee (Dr. R. C. Tolman, chairman; Rear Admiral E. W. Mills (USN)\nwith Captain T. A. Solberg (USN) as deputy, Dr. W. K. Lewis, and Dr. H. D. Smyth) received a\nmultitude of suggestions from men on the various projects, principally along the lines of the use\nof nuclear energy for power and the use of radioactive by-products for scientific, medical, and\nindustrial purposes. While there was general agreement that a great industry might eventually\narise, comparable, perhaps, with the electronics industry, there was disagreement as to how\nrapidly such an industry would grow; the consensus was that the growth would be slow over a\nperiod of many years. At least there is no immediate prospect of running cars with nuclear power\nor lighting houses with radioactive lamps although there is a good probability that nuclear power\nfor special purposes could be developed within ten years and that plentiful supplies of\nradioactive materials can have a profound effect on scientific research and perhaps on the\ntreatment of certain diseases in a similar period.\nPLANNING FOR THE FUTURE\n13.6. During the war the effort has been to achieve the maximum military results. It has been\napparent for some time that some sort of government control and support in the field of nuclear\nenergy must continue after the war. Many of the men associated with the project have recognized\nthis fact and have come forward with various proposals, some of which were considered by the\nTolman Committee, although it was only a temporary advisory committee reporting to General\nGroves. An interim committee at a high level is now engaged in formulating plans for a\ncontinuing organization. This committee is also discussing matters of general policy about which\nmany of the more thoughtful men on the project have been deeply concerned since the work was\nbegun and especially since success became more and more probable.\nTHE QUESTIONS BEFORE THE PEOPLE\n13.7. We find ourselves with an explosive which is far from completely perfected. Yet the future\npossibilities of such explosives are appalling, and their effects on future wars and international\naffairs are of fundamental importance. Here is a new tool for mankind, a tool of unimaginable\ndestructive power. Its development raises many questions that must be answered in the near\nfuture.\n\n13.8. Because of the restrictions of military security there has been no chance for the Congress or\nthe people to debate such questions. They have been seriously considered by all concerned and\nvigorously debated among the scientists, and the conclusions reached have been passed along to\nthe highest authorities. These questions are not technical questions; they are political and social\nquestions, and the answers given to them may affect all mankind for generations. In thinking\nabout them the men on the project have been thinking as citizens of the United States vitally\ninterested in the welfare of the human race. It has been their duty and that of the responsible high\ngovernment officials who were informed to look beyond the limits of the present war and its\nweapons to the ultimate implications of these discoveries. This was a heavy responsibility. In a\nfree country like ours, such questions should be debated by the people and decisions must be\nmade by the people through their representatives. This is one reason for the release of this report.\nIt is a semi-technical report which it is hoped men of science in this country can use to help their\nfellow citizens in reaching wise decisions. The people of the country must be informed if they\nare to discharge their responsibilities wisely.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\nSTS.003 The Rise of Modern Science\nFall 2010\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

'Beagle,' as naturalist, I was much struck with certain facts in the\ndistribution of the inhabitants of South America, and in the geological relations of the present to\nthe past inhabitants of that continent. These facts seemed to me to throw some light on the origin\nof species--that mystery of mysteries, as it has been called by one of our greatest philosophers.\nOn my return home, it occurred to me, in 1837, that something might perhaps be made out on\nthis question by patiently accumulating and reflecting on all sorts of facts which could possibly\nhave any bearing on it. After five years' work I allowed myself to speculate on the subject, and\ndrew up some short notes; these I enlarged in 1844 into a sketch of the conclusions, which then\nseemed to me probable: from that period to the present day I have steadily pursued the same\nobject. I hope that I may be excused for entering on these personal details, as I give them to show\nthat I have not been hasty in coming to a decision.\nMy work is now nearly finished; but as it will take me two or three more years to complete it,\nand as my health is far from strong, I have been urged to publish this Abstract. I have more\nespecially been induced to do this, as Mr. Wallace, who is now studying the natural history of the\nMalay archipelago, has arrived at almost exactly the same general conclusions that I have on the\norigin of species. Last year he sent to me a memoir on this subject, with a request that I would\nforward it to Sir Charles Lyell, who sent it to the Linnean Society, and it is published in the third\nvolume of the Journal of that Society. Sir C. Lyell and Dr. Hooker, who both knew of my\nwork--the latter having read my sketch of 1844--honoured me by thinking it advisable to\npublish, with Mr. Wallace's excellent memoir, some brief extracts from my manuscripts.\nThis Abstract, which I now publish, must necessarily be imperfect. I cannot here give references\nand authorities for my several statements; and I must trust to the reader reposing some\nconfidence in my accuracy. No doubt errors will have crept in, though I hope I have always been\ncautious in trusting to good authorities alone. I can here give only the general conclusions at\nwhich I have arrived, with a few facts in illustration, but which, I hope, in most cases will\nsuffice. No one can feel more sensible than I do of the necessity of hereafter publishing in detail\nall the facts, with references, on which my conclusions have been grounded; and I hope in a\nfuture work to do this. For I am well aware that scarcely a single point is discussed in this\nvolume on which facts cannot be adduced, often apparently leading to conclusions directly\nopposite to those at which I have arrived. A fair result can be obtained only by fully stating and\nbalancing the facts and arguments on both sides of each question; and this cannot possibly be\nhere done.\nI much regret that want of space prevents my having the satisfaction of acknowledging the\ngenerous assistance which I have received from very many naturalists, some of them personally\nunknown to me. I cannot, however, let this opportunity pass without expressing my deep\nobligations to Dr. Hooker, who for the last fifteen years has aided me in every possible way by\nhis large stores of knowledge and his excellent judgment.\n\nIn considering the Origin of Species, it is quite conceivable that a naturalist, reflecting on the\nmutual affinities of organic beings, on their embryological relations, their geographical\ndistribution, geological succession, and other such facts, might come to the conclusion that each\nspecies had not been independently created, but had descended, like varieties, from other species.\nNevertheless, such a conclusion, even if well founded, would be unsatisfactory, until it could be\nshown how the innumerable species inhabiting this world have been modified, so as to acquire\nthat perfection of structure and coadaptation which most justly excites our admiration.\nNaturalists continually refer to external conditions, such as climate, food, etc., as the only\npossible cause of variation. In one very limited sense, as we shall hereafter see, this may be true;\nbut it is preposterous to attribute to mere external conditions, the structure, for instance, of the\nwoodpecker, with its feet, tail, beak, and tongue, so admirably adapted to catch insects under the\nbark of trees. In the case of the misseltoe, which draws its nourishment from certain trees, which\nhas seeds that must be transported by certain birds, and which has flowers with separate sexes\nabsolutely requiring the agency of certain insects to bring pollen from one flower to the other, it\nis equally preposterous to account for the structure of this parasite, with its relations to several\ndistinct organic beings, by the effects of external conditions, or of habit, or of the volition of the\nplant itself.\nThe author of the 'Vestiges of Creation' would, I presume, say that, after a certain unknown\nnumber of generations, some bird had given birth to a woodpecker, and some plant to the\nmisseltoe, and that these had been produced perfect as we now see them; but this assumption\nseems to me to be no explanation, for it leaves the case of the coadaptations of organic beings to\neach other and to their physical conditions of life, untouched and unexplained.\nIt is, therefore, of the highest importance to gain a clear insight into the means of modification\nand coadaptation. At the commencement of my observations it seemed to me probable that a\ncareful study of domesticated animals and of cultivated plants would offer the best chance of\nmaking out this obscure problem. Nor have I been disappointed; in this and in all other\nperplexing cases I have invariably found that our knowledge, imperfect though it be, of variation\nunder domestication, afforded the best and safest clue. I may venture to express my conviction of\nthe high value of such studies, although they have been very commonly neglected by naturalists.\nFrom these considerations, I shall devote the first chapter of this Abstract to Variation under\nDomestication. We shall thus see that a large amount of hereditary modification is at least\npossible, and, what is equally or more important, we shall see how great is the power of man in\naccumulating by his Selection successive slight variations. I will then pass on to the variability of\nspecies in a state of nature; but I shall, unfortunately, be compelled to treat this subject far too\nbriefly, as it can be treated properly only by giving long catalogues of facts. We shall, however,\nbe enabled to discuss what circumstances are most favourable to variation. In the next chapter\nthe Struggle for Existence amongst all organic beings throughout the world, which inevitably\nfollows from their high geometrical powers of increase, will be treated of. This is the doctrine of\nMalthus, applied to the whole animal and vegetable kingdoms. As many more individuals of\neach species are born than can possibly survive; and as, consequently, there is a frequently\nrecurring struggle for existence, it follows that any being, if it vary however slightly in any\nmanner profitable to itself, under the complex and sometimes varying conditions of life, will\n\nhave a better chance of surviving, and thus be NATURALLY SELECTED. From the strong\nprinciple of inheritance, any selected variety will tend to propagate its new and modified form.\nThis fundamental subject of Natural Selection will be treated at some length in the fourth\nchapter; and we shall then see how Natural Selection almost inevitably causes much Extinction\nof the less improved forms of life and induces what I have called Divergence of Character. In the\nnext chapter I shall discuss the complex and little known laws of variation and of correlation of\ngrowth. In the four succeeding chapters, the most apparent and gravest difficulties on the theory\nwill be given: namely, first, the difficulties of transitions, or in understanding how a simple being\nor a simple organ can be changed and perfected into a highly developed being or elaborately\nconstructed organ; secondly the subject of Instinct, or the mental powers of animals, thirdly,\nHybridism, or the infertility of species and the fertility of varieties when intercrossed; and\nfourthly, the imperfection of the Geological Record. In the next chapter I shall consider the\ngeological succession of organic beings throughout time; in the eleventh and twelfth, their\ngeographical distribution throughout space; in the thirteenth, their classification or mutual\naffinities, both when mature and in an embryonic condition. In the last chapter I shall give a brief\nrecapitulation of the whole work, and a few concluding remarks.\nNo one ought to feel surprise at much remaining as yet unexplained in regard to the origin of\nspecies and varieties, if he makes due allowance for our profound ignorance in regard to the\nmutual relations of all the beings which live around us. Who can explain why one species ranges\nwidely and is very numerous, and why another allied species has a narrow range and is rare? Yet\nthese relations are of the highest importance, for they determine the present welfare, and, as I\nbelieve, the future success and modification of every inhabitant of this world. Still less do we\nknow of the mutual relations of the innumerable inhabitants of the world during the many past\ngeological epochs in its history. Although much remains obscure, and will long remain obscure, I\ncan entertain no doubt, after the most deliberate study and dispassionate judgment of which I am\ncapable, that the view which most naturalists entertain, and which I formerly entertained--\nnamely, that each species has been independently created--is erroneous. I am fully convinced\nthat species are not immutable; but that those belonging to what are called the same genera are\nlineal descendants of some other and generally extinct species, in the same manner as the\nacknowledged varieties of any one species are the descendants of that species. Furthermore, I am\nconvinced that Natural Selection has been the main but not exclusive means of modification.\n\n3. STRUGGLE FOR EXISTENCE.\nBears on natural selection. The term used in a wide sense. Geometrical powers of increase. Rapid\nincrease of naturalised animals and plants. Nature of the checks to increase. Competition\nuniversal. Effects of climate. Protection from the number of individuals. Complex relations of all\nanimals and plants throughout nature. Struggle for life most severe between individuals and\nvarieties of the same species; often severe between species of the same genus. The relation of\norganism to organism the most important of all relations.\nBefore entering on the subject of this chapter, I must make a few preliminary remarks, to show\nhow the struggle for existence bears on Natural Selection. It has been seen in the last chapter that\namongst organic beings in a state of nature there is some individual variability; indeed I am not\naware that this has ever been disputed. It is immaterial for us whether a multitude of doubtful\nforms be called species or sub-species or varieties; what rank, for instance, the two or three\nhundred doubtful forms of British plants are entitled to hold, if the existence of any well-marked\nvarieties be admitted. But the mere existence of individual variability and of some few well-\nmarked varieties, though necessary as the foundation for the work, helps us but little in\nunderstanding how species arise in nature. How have all those exquisite adaptations of one part\nof the organisation to another part, and to the conditions of life, and of one distinct organic being\nto another being, been perfected? We see these beautiful co-adaptations most plainly in the\nwoodpecker and missletoe; and only a little less plainly in the humblest parasite which clings to\nthe hairs of a quadruped or feathers of a bird; in the structure of the beetle which dives through\nthe water; in the plumed seed which is wafted by the gentlest breeze; in short, we see beautiful\nadaptations everywhere and in every part of the organic world.\nAgain, it may be asked, how is it that varieties, which I have called incipient species, become\nultimately converted into good and distinct species, which in most cases obviously differ from\neach other far more than do the varieties of the same species? How do those groups of species,\nwhich constitute what are called distinct genera, and which differ from each other more than do\nthe species of the same genus, arise? All these results, as we shall more fully see in the next\nchapter, follow inevitably from the struggle for life. Owing to this struggle for life, any variation,\nhowever slight and from whatever cause proceeding, if it be in any degree profitable to an\nindividual of any species, in its infinitely complex relations to other organic beings and to\nexternal nature, will tend to the preservation of that individual, and will generally be inherited by\nits offspring. The offspring, also, will thus have a better chance of surviving, for, of the many\nindividuals of any species which are periodically born, but a small number can survive. I have\ncalled this principle, by which each slight variation, if useful, is preserved, by the term of Natural\nSelection, in order to mark its relation to man's power of selection. We have seen that man by\nselection can certainly produce great results, and can adapt organic beings to his own uses,\nthrough the accumulation of slight but useful variations, given to him by the hand of Nature. But\nNatural Selection, as we shall hereafter see, is a power incessantly ready for action, and is as\nimmeasurably superior to man's feeble efforts, as the works of Nature are to those of Art.\n\nWe will now discuss in a little more detail the struggle for existence. In my future work this\nsubject shall be treated, as it well deserves, at much greater length. The elder De Candolle and\nLyell have largely and philosophically shown that all organic beings are exposed to severe\ncompetition. In regard to plants, no one has treated this subject with more spirit and ability than\nW. Herbert, Dean of Manchester, evidently the result of his great horticultural knowledge.\nNothing is easier than to admit in words the truth of the universal struggle for life, or more\ndifficult--at least I have found it so--than constantly to bear this conclusion in mind. Yet unless\nit be thoroughly engrained in the mind, I am convinced that the whole economy of nature, with\nevery fact on distribution, rarity, abundance, extinction, and variation, will be dimly seen or quite\nmisunderstood. We behold the face of nature bright with gladness, we often see superabundance\nof food; we do not see, or we forget, that the birds which are idly singing round us mostly live on\ninsects or seeds, and are thus constantly destroying life; or we forget how largely these songsters,\nor their eggs, or their nestlings, are destroyed by birds and beasts of prey; we do not always bear\nin mind, that though food may be now superabundant, it is not so at all seasons of each recurring\nyear.\nI should premise that I use the term Struggle for Existence in a large and metaphorical sense,\nincluding dependence of one being on another, and including (which is more important) not only\nthe life of the individual, but success in leaving progeny. Two canine animals in a time of dearth,\nmay be truly said to struggle with each other which shall get food and live. But a plant on the\nedge of a desert is said to struggle for life against the drought, though more properly it should be\nsaid to be dependent on the moisture. A plant which annually produces a thousand seeds, of\nwhich on an average only one comes to maturity, may be more truly said to struggle with the\nplants of the same and other kinds which already clothe the ground. The missletoe is dependent\non the apple and a few other trees, but can only in a far-fetched sense be said to struggle with\nthese trees, for if too many of these parasites grow on the same tree, it will languish and die. But\nseveral seedling missletoes, growing close together on the same branch, may more truly be said\nto struggle with each other. As the missletoe is disseminated by birds, its existence depends on\nbirds; and it may metaphorically be said to struggle with other fruit-bearing plants, in order to\ntempt birds to devour and thus disseminate its seeds rather than those of other plants. In these\nseveral senses, which pass into each other, I use for convenience sake the general term of\nstruggle for existence.\nA struggle for existence inevitably follows from the high rate at which all organic beings tend to\nincrease. Every being, which during its natural lifetime produces several eggs or seeds, must\nsuffer destruction during some period of its life, and during some season or occasional year,\notherwise, on the principle of geometrical increase, its numbers would quickly become so\ninordinately great that no country could support the product. Hence, as more individuals are\nproduced than can possibly survive, there must in every case be a struggle for existence, either\none individual with another of the same species, or with the individuals of distinct species, or\nwith the physical conditions of life. It is the doctrine of Malthus applied with manifold force to\nthe whole animal and vegetable kingdoms; for in this case there can be no artificial increase of\nfood, and no prudential restraint from marriage. Although some species may be now increasing,\nmore or less rapidly, in numbers, all cannot do so, for the world would not hold them.\n\nThere is no exception to the rule that every organic being naturally increases at so high a rate,\nthat if not destroyed, the earth would soon be covered by the progeny of a single pair. Even slow-\nbreeding man has doubled in twenty-five years, and at this rate, in a few thousand years, there\nwould literally not be standing room for his progeny. Linnaeus has calculated that if an annual\nplant produced only two seeds--and there is no plant so unproductive as this--and their\nseedlings next year produced two, and so on, then in twenty years there would be a million\nplants. The elephant is reckoned to be the slowest breeder of all known animals, and I have taken\nsome pains to estimate its probable minimum rate of natural increase: it will be under the mark to\nassume that it breeds when thirty years old, and goes on breeding till ninety years old, bringing\nforth three pair of young in this interval; if this be so, at the end of the fifth century there would\nbe alive fifteen million elephants, descended from the first pair.\nBut we have better evidence on this subject than mere theoretical calculations, namely, the\nnumerous recorded cases of the astonishingly rapid increase of various animals in a state of\nnature, when circumstances have been favourable to them during two or three following seasons.\nStill more striking is the evidence from our domestic animals of many kinds which have run wild\nin several parts of the world: if the statements of the rate of increase of slow-breeding cattle and\nhorses in South America, and latterly in Australia, had not been well authenticated, they would\nhave been quite incredible. So it is with plants: cases could be given of introduced plants which\nhave become common throughout whole islands in a period of less than ten years. Several of the\nplants now most numerous over the wide plains of La Plata, clothing square leagues of surface\nalmost to the exclusion of all other plants, have been introduced from Europe; and there are\nplants which now range in India, as I hear from Dr. Falconer, from Cape Comorin to the\nHimalaya, which have been imported from America since its discovery. In such cases, and\nendless instances could be given, no one supposes that the fertility of these animals or plants has\nbeen suddenly and temporarily increased in any sensible degree. The obvious explanation is that\nthe conditions of life have been very favourable, and that there has consequently been less\ndestruction of the old and young, and that nearly all the young have been enabled to breed. In\nsuch cases the geometrical ratio of increase, the result of which never fails to be surprising,\nsimply explains the extraordinarily rapid increase and wide diffusion of naturalised productions\nin their new homes.\nIn a state of nature almost every plant produces seed, and amongst animals there are very few\nwhich do not annually pair. Hence we may confidently assert, that all plants and animals are\ntending to increase at a geometrical ratio, that all would most rapidly stock every station in\nwhich they could any how exist, and that the geometrical tendency to increase must be checked\nby destruction at some period of life. Our familiarity with the larger domestic animals tends, I\nthink, to mislead us: we see no great destruction falling on them, and we forget that thousands\nare annually slaughtered for food, and that in a state of nature an equal number would have\nsomehow to be disposed of.\nThe only difference between organisms which annually produce eggs or seeds by the thousand,\nand those which produce extremely few, is, that the slow-breeders would require a few more\nyears to people, under favourable conditions, a whole district, let it be ever so large. The condor\nlays a couple of eggs and the ostrich a score, and yet in the same country the condor may be the\nmore numerous of the two: the Fulmar petrel lays but one egg, yet it is believed to be the most\n\nnumerous bird in the world. One fly deposits hundreds of eggs, and another, like the hippobosca,\na single one; but this difference does not determine how many individuals of the two species can\nbe supported in a district. A large number of eggs is of some importance to those species, which\ndepend on a rapidly fluctuating amount of food, for it allows them rapidly to increase in number.\nBut the real importance of a large number of eggs or seeds is to make up for much destruction at\nsome period of life; and this period in the great majority of cases is an early one. If an animal can\nin any way protect its own eggs or young, a small number may be produced, and yet the average\nstock be fully kept up; but if many eggs or young are destroyed, many must be produced, or the\nspecies will become extinct. It would suffice to keep up the full number of a tree, which lived on\nan average for a thousand years, if a single seed were produced once in a thousand years,\nsupposing that this seed were never destroyed, and could be ensured to germinate in a fitting\nplace. So that in all cases, the average number of any animal or plant depends only indirectly on\nthe number of its eggs or seeds.\nIn looking at Nature, it is most necessary to keep the foregoing considerations always in mind--\nnever to forget that every single organic being around us may be said to be striving to the utmost\nto increase in numbers; that each lives by a struggle at some period of its life; that heavy\ndestruction inevitably falls either on the young or old, during each generation or at recurrent\nintervals. Lighten any check, mitigate the destruction ever so little, and the number of the species\nwill almost instantaneously increase to any amount. The face of Nature may be compared to a\nyielding surface, with ten thousand sharp wedges packed close together and driven inwards by\nincessant blows, sometimes one wedge being struck, and then another with greater force.\nWhat checks the natural tendency of each species to increase in number is most obscure. Look at\nthe most vigorous species; by as much as it swarms in numbers, by so much will its tendency to\nincrease be still further increased. We know not exactly what the checks are in even one single\ninstance. Nor will this surprise any one who reflects how ignorant we are on this head, even in\nregard to mankind, so incomparably better known than any other animal. This subject has been\nably treated by several authors, and I shall, in my future work, discuss some of the checks at\nconsiderable length, more especially in regard to the feral animals of South America. Here I will\nmake only a few remarks, just to recall to the reader's mind some of the chief points. Eggs or\nvery young animals seem generally to suffer most, but this is not invariably the case. With plants\nthere is a vast destruction of seeds, but, from some observations which I have made, I believe\nthat it is the seedlings which suffer most from germinating in ground already thickly stocked\nwith other plants. Seedlings, also, are destroyed in vast numbers by various enemies; for\ninstance, on a piece of ground three feet long and two wide, dug and cleared, and where there\ncould be no choking from other plants, I marked all the seedlings of our native weeds as they\ncame up, and out of the 357 no less than 295 were destroyed, chiefly by slugs and insects. If turf\nwhich has long been mown, and the case would be the same with turf closely browsed by\nquadrupeds, be let to grow, the more vigorous plants gradually kill the less vigorous, though\nfully grown, plants: thus out of twenty species growing on a little plot of turf (three feet by four)\nnine species perished from the other species being allowed to grow up freely.\nThe amount of food for each species of course gives the extreme limit to which each can\nincrease; but very frequently it is not the obtaining food, but the serving as prey to other animals,\nwhich determines the average numbers of a species. Thus, there seems to be little doubt that the\n\nstock of partridges, grouse, and hares on any large estate depends chiefly on the destruction of\nvermin. If not one head of game were shot during the next twenty years in England, and, at the\nsame time, if no vermin were destroyed, there would, in all probability, be less game than at\npresent, although hundreds of thousands of game animals are now annually killed. On the other\nhand, in some cases, as with the elephant and rhinoceros, none are destroyed by beasts of prey:\neven the tiger in India most rarely dares to attack a young elephant protected by its dam.\nClimate plays an important part in determining the average numbers of a species, and periodical\nseasons of extreme cold or drought, I believe to be the most effective of all checks. I estimated\nthat the winter of 1854-55 destroyed four-fifths of the birds in my own grounds; and this is a\ntremendous destruction, when we remember that ten per cent. is an extraordinarily severe\nmortality from epidemics with man. The action of climate seems at first sight to be quite\nindependent of the struggle for existence; but in so far as climate chiefly acts in reducing food, it\nbrings on the most severe struggle between the individuals, whether of the same or of distinct\nspecies, which subsist on the same kind of food. Even when climate, for instance extreme cold,\nacts directly, it will be the least vigorous, or those which have got least food through the\nadvancing winter, which will suffer most. When we travel from south to north, or from a damp\nregion to a dry, we invariably see some species gradually getting rarer and rarer, and finally\ndisappearing; and the change of climate being conspicuous, we are tempted to attribute the whole\neffect to its direct action. But this is a very false view: we forget that each species, even where it\nmost abounds, is constantly suffering enormous destruction at some period of its life, from\nenemies or from competitors for the same place and food; and if these enemies or competitors be\nin the least degree favoured by any slight change of climate, they will increase in numbers, and,\nas each area is already fully stocked with inhabitants, the other species will decrease. When we\ntravel southward and see a species decreasing in numbers, we may feel sure that the cause lies\nquite as much in other species being favoured, as in this one being hurt. So it is when we travel\nnorthward, but in a somewhat lesser degree, for the number of species of all kinds, and therefore\nof competitors, decreases northwards; hence in going northward, or in ascending a mountain, we\nfar oftener meet with stunted forms, due to the DIRECTLY injurious action of climate, than we\ndo in proceeding southwards or in descending a mountain. When we reach the Arctic regions, or\nsnow-capped summits, or absolute deserts, the struggle for life is almost exclusively with the\nelements.\nThat climate acts in main part indirectly by favouring other species, we may clearly see in the\nprodigious number of plants in our gardens which can perfectly well endure our climate, but\nwhich never become naturalised, for they cannot compete with our native plants, nor resist\ndestruction by our native animals.\nWhen a species, owing to highly favourable circumstances, increases inordinately in numbers in\na small tract, epidemics--at least, this seems generally to occur with our game animals--often\nensue: and here we have a limiting check independent of the struggle for life. But even some of\nthese so-called epidemics appear to be due to parasitic worms, which have from some cause,\npossibly in part through facility of diffusion amongst the crowded animals, been\ndisproportionably favoured: and here comes in a sort of struggle between the parasite and its\nprey.\n\nOn the other hand, in many cases, a large stock of individuals of the same species, relatively to\nthe numbers of its enemies, is absolutely necessary for its preservation. Thus we can easily raise\nplenty of corn and rape-seed, etc., in our fields, because the seeds are in great excess compared\nwith the number of birds which feed on them; nor can the birds, though having a superabundance\nof food at this one season, increase in number proportionally to the supply of seed, as their\nnumbers are checked during winter: but any one who has tried, knows how troublesome it is to\nget seed from a few wheat or other such plants in a garden; I have in this case lost every single\nseed. This view of the necessity of a large stock of the same species for its preservation, explains,\nI believe, some singular facts in nature, such as that of very rare plants being sometimes\nextremely abundant in the few spots where they do occur; and that of some social plants being\nsocial, that is, abounding in individuals, even on the extreme confines of their range. For in such\ncases, we may believe, that a plant could exist only where the conditions of its life were so\nfavourable that many could exist together, and thus save each other from utter destruction. I\nshould add that the good effects of frequent intercrossing, and the ill effects of close\ninterbreeding, probably come into play in some of these cases; but on this intricate subject I will\nnot here enlarge.\nMany cases are on record showing how complex and unexpected are the checks and relations\nbetween organic beings, which have to struggle together in the same country. I will give only a\nsingle instance, which, though a simple one, has interested me. In Staffordshire, on the estate of a\nrelation where I had ample means of investigation, there was a large and extremely barren heath,\nwhich had never been touched by the hand of man; but several hundred acres of exactly the same\nnature had been enclosed twenty-five years previously and planted with Scotch fir. The change\nin the native vegetation of the planted part of the heath was most remarkable, more than is\ngenerally seen in passing from one quite different soil to another: not only the proportional\nnumbers of the heath-plants were wholly changed, but twelve species of plants (not counting\ngrasses and carices) flourished in the plantations, which could not be found on the heath. The\neffect on the insects must have been still greater, for six insectivorous birds were very common\nin the plantations, which were not to be seen on the heath; and the heath was frequented by two\nor three distinct insectivorous birds. Here we see how potent has been the effect of the\nintroduction of a single tree, nothing whatever else having been done, with the exception that the\nland had been enclosed, so that cattle could not enter. But how important an element enclosure\nis, I plainly saw near Farnham, in Surrey. Here there are extensive heaths, with a few clumps of\nold Scotch firs on the distant hill-tops: within the last ten years large spaces have been enclosed,\nand self-sown firs are now springing up in multitudes, so close together that all cannot live.\nWhen I ascertained that these young trees had not been sown or planted, I was so much surprised\nat their numbers that I went to several points of view, whence I could examine hundreds of acres\nof the unenclosed heath, and literally I could not see a single Scotch fir, except the old planted\nclumps. But on looking closely between the stems of the heath, I found a multitude of seedlings\nand little trees, which had been perpetually browsed down by the cattle. In one square yard, at a\npoint some hundred yards distant from one of the old clumps, I counted thirty-two little trees;\nand one of them, judging from the rings of growth, had during twenty-six years tried to raise its\nhead above the stems of the heath, and had failed. No wonder that, as soon as the land was\nenclosed, it became thickly clothed with vigorously growing young firs. Yet the heath was so\n\nextremely barren and so extensive that no one would ever have imagined that cattle would have\nso closely and effectually searched it for food.\nHere we see that cattle absolutely determine the existence of the Scotch fir; but in several parts\nof the world insects determine the existence of cattle. Perhaps Paraguay offers the most curious\ninstance of this; for here neither cattle nor horses nor dogs have ever run wild, though they\nswarm southward and northward in a feral state; and Azara and Rengger have shown that this is\ncaused by the greater number in Paraguay of a certain fly, which lays its eggs in the navels of\nthese animals when first born. The increase of these flies, numerous as they are, must be\nhabitually checked by some means, probably by birds. Hence, if certain insectivorous birds\n(whose numbers are probably regulated by hawks or beasts of prey) were to increase in\nParaguay, the flies would decrease--then cattle and horses would become feral, and this would\ncertainly greatly alter (as indeed I have observed in parts of South America) the vegetation: this\nagain would largely affect the insects; and this, as we just have seen in Staffordshire, the\ninsectivorous birds, and so onwards in ever-increasing circles of complexity. We began this\nseries by insectivorous birds, and we have ended with them. Not that in nature the relations can\never be as simple as this. Battle within battle must ever be recurring with varying success; and\nyet in the long-run the forces are so nicely balanced, that the face of nature remains uniform for\nlong periods of time, though assuredly the merest trifle would often give the victory to one\norganic being over another. Nevertheless so profound is our ignorance, and so high our\npresumption, that we marvel when we hear of the extinction of an organic being; and as we do\nnot see the cause, we invoke cataclysms to desolate the world, or invent laws on the duration of\nthe forms of life!\nI am tempted to give one more instance showing how plants and animals, most remote in the\nscale of nature, are bound together by a web of complex relations. I shall hereafter have occasion\nto show that the exotic Lobelia fulgens, in this part of England, is never visited by insects, and\nconsequently, from its peculiar structure, never can set a seed. Many of our orchidaceous plants\nabsolutely require the visits of moths to remove their pollen-masses and thus to fertilise them. I\nhave, also, reason to believe that humble-bees are indispensable to the fertilisation of the\nheartsease (Viola tricolor), for other bees do not visit this flower. From experiments which I have\ntried, I have found that the visits of bees, if not indispensable, are at least highly beneficial to the\nfertilisation of our clovers; but humble-bees alone visit the common red clover (Trifolium\npratense), as other bees cannot reach the nectar. Hence I have very little doubt, that if the whole\ngenus of humble-bees became extinct or very rare in England, the heartsease and red clover\nwould become very rare, or wholly disappear. The number of humble-bees in any district\ndepends in a great degree on the number of field-mice, which destroy their combs and nests; and\nMr. H. Newman, who has long attended to the habits of humble-bees, believes that \"more than\ntwo thirds of them are thus destroyed all over England.\" Now the number of mice is largely\ndependent, as every one knows, on the number of cats; and Mr. Newman says, \"Near villages\nand small towns I have found the nests of humble-bees more numerous than elsewhere, which I\nattribute to the number of cats that destroy the mice.\" Hence it is quite credible that the presence\nof a feline animal in large numbers in a district might determine, through the intervention first of\nmice and then of bees, the frequency of certain flowers in that district!\n\nIn the case of every species, many different checks, acting at different periods of life, and during\ndifferent seasons or years, probably come into play; some one check or some few being generally\nthe most potent, but all concurring in determining the average number or even the existence of\nthe species. In some cases it can be shown that widely-different checks act on the same species in\ndifferent districts. When we look at the plants and bushes clothing an entangled bank, we are\ntempted to attribute their proportional numbers and kinds to what we call chance. But how false\na view is this! Every one has heard that when an American forest is cut down, a very different\nvegetation springs up; but it has been observed that the trees now growing on the ancient Indian\nmounds, in the Southern United States, display the same beautiful diversity and proportion of\nkinds as in the surrounding virgin forests. What a struggle between the several kinds of trees\nmust here have gone on during long centuries, each annually scattering its seeds by the thousand;\nwhat war between insect and insect--between insects, snails, and other animals with birds and\nbeasts of prey--all striving to increase, and all feeding on each other or on the trees or their\nseeds and seedlings, or on the other plants which first clothed the ground and thus checked the\ngrowth of the trees! Throw up a handful of feathers, and all must fall to the ground according to\ndefinite laws; but how simple is this problem compared to the action and reaction of the\ninnumerable plants and animals which have determined, in the course of centuries, the\nproportional numbers and kinds of trees now growing on the old Indian ruins!\nThe dependency of one organic being on another, as of a parasite on its prey, lies generally\nbetween beings remote in the scale of nature. This is often the case with those which may strictly\nbe said to struggle with each other for existence, as in the case of locusts and grass-feeding\nquadrupeds. But the struggle almost invariably will be most severe between the individuals of\nthe same species, for they frequent the same districts, require the same food, and are exposed to\nthe same dangers. In the case of varieties of the same species, the struggle will generally be\nalmost equally severe, and we sometimes see the contest soon decided: for instance, if several\nvarieties of wheat be sown together, and the mixed seed be resown, some of the varieties which\nbest suit the soil or climate, or are naturally the most fertile, will beat the others and so yield\nmore seed, and will consequently in a few years quite supplant the other varieties. To keep up a\nmixed stock of even such extremely close varieties as the variously coloured sweet-peas, they\nmust be each year harvested separately, and the seed then mixed in due proportion, otherwise the\nweaker kinds will steadily decrease in numbers and disappear. So again with the varieties of\nsheep: it has been asserted that certain mountain-varieties will starve out other mountain-\nvarieties, so that they cannot be kept together. The same result has followed from keeping\ntogether different varieties of the medicinal leech. It may even be doubted whether the varieties\nof any one of our domestic plants or animals have so exactly the same strength, habits, and\nconstitution, that the original proportions of a mixed stock could be kept up for half a dozen\ngenerations, if they were allowed to struggle together, like beings in a state of nature, and if the\nseed or young were not annually sorted.\nAs species of the same genus have usually, though by no means invariably, some similarity in\nhabits and constitution, and always in structure, the struggle will generally be more severe\nbetween species of the same genus, when they come into competition with each other, than\nbetween species of distinct genera. We see this in the recent extension over parts of the United\nStates of one species of swallow having caused the decrease of another species. The recent\nincrease of the missel-thrush in parts of Scotland has caused the decrease of the song-thrush.\n\nHow frequently we hear of one species of rat taking the place of another species under the most\ndifferent climates! In Russia the small Asiatic cockroach has everywhere driven before it its\ngreat congener. One species of charlock will supplant another, and so in other cases. We can\ndimly see why the competition should be most severe between allied forms, which fill nearly the\nsame place in the economy of nature; but probably in no one case could we precisely say why\none species has been victorious over another in the great battle of life.\nA corollary of the highest importance may be deduced from the foregoing remarks, namely, that\nthe structure of every organic being is related, in the most essential yet often hidden manner, to\nthat of all other organic beings, with which it comes into competition for food or residence, or\nfrom which it has to escape, or on which it preys. This is obvious in the structure of the teeth and\ntalons of the tiger; and in that of the legs and claws of the parasite which clings to the hair on the\ntiger's body. But in the beautifully plumed seed of the dandelion, and in the flattened and fringed\nlegs of the water-beetle, the relation seems at first confined to the elements of air and water. Yet\nthe advantage of plumed seeds no doubt stands in the closest relation to the land being already\nthickly clothed by other plants; so that the seeds may be widely distributed and fall on\nunoccupied ground. In the water-beetle, the structure of its legs, so well adapted for diving,\nallows it to compete with other aquatic insects, to hunt for its own prey, and to escape serving as\nprey to other animals.\nThe store of nutriment laid up within the seeds of many plants seems at first sight to have no sort\nof relation to other plants. But from the strong growth of young plants produced from such seeds\n(as peas and beans), when sown in the midst of long grass, I suspect that the chief use of the\nnutriment in the seed is to favour the growth of the young seedling, whilst struggling with other\nplants growing vigorously all around.\nLook at a plant in the midst of its range, why does it not double or quadruple its numbers? We\nknow that it can perfectly well withstand a little more heat or cold, dampness or dryness, for\nelsewhere it ranges into slightly hotter or colder, damper or drier districts. In this case we can\nclearly see that if we wished in imagination to give the plant the power of increasing in number,\nwe should have to give it some advantage over its competitors, or over the animals which preyed\non it. On the confines of its geographical range, a change of constitution with respect to climate\nwould clearly be an advantage to our plant; but we have reason to believe that only a few plants\nor animals range so far, that they are destroyed by the rigour of the climate alone. Not until we\nreach the extreme confines of life, in the arctic regions or on the borders of an utter desert, will\ncompetition cease. The land may be extremely cold or dry, yet there will be competition between\nsome few species, or between the individuals of the same species, for the warmest or dampest\nspots.\nHence, also, we can see that when a plant or animal is placed in a new country amongst new\ncompetitors, though the climate may be exactly the same as in its former home, yet the\nconditions of its life will generally be changed in an essential manner. If we wished to increase\nits average numbers in its new home, we should have to modify it in a different way to what we\nshould have done in its native country; for we should have to give it some advantage over a\ndifferent set of competitors or enemies.\n\nIt is good thus to try in our imagination to give any form some advantage over another. Probably\nin no single instance should we know what to do, so as to succeed. It will convince us of our\nignorance on the mutual relations of all organic beings; a conviction as necessary, as it seems to\nbe difficult to acquire. All that we can do, is to keep steadily in mind that each organic being is\nstriving to increase at a geometrical ratio; that each at some period of its life, during some season\nof the year, during each generation or at intervals, has to struggle for life, and to suffer great\ndestruction. When we reflect on this struggle, we may console ourselves with the full belief, that\nthe war of nature is not incessant, that no fear is felt, that death is generally prompt, and that the\nvigorous, the healthy, and the happy survive and multiply.\n\n14. RECAPITULATION AND CONCLUSION.\nRecapitulation of the difficulties on the theory of Natural Selection. Recapitulation of the general\nand special circumstances in its favour. Causes of the general belief in the immutability of\nspecies. How far the theory of natural selection may be extended. Effects of its adoption on the\nstudy of Natural history. Concluding remarks.\nAs this whole volume is one long argument, it may be convenient to the reader to have the\nleading facts and inferences briefly recapitulated.\nThat many and grave objections may be advanced against the theory of descent with\nmodification through natural selection, I do not deny. I have endeavoured to give to them their\nfull force. Nothing at first can appear more difficult to believe than that the more complex organs\nand instincts should have been perfected, not by means superior to, though analogous with,\nhuman reason, but by the accumulation of innumerable slight variations, each good for the\nindividual possessor. Nevertheless, this difficulty, though appearing to our imagination\ninsuperably great, cannot be considered real if we admit the following propositions, namely,--\nthat gradations in the perfection of any organ or instinct, which we may consider, either do now\nexist or could have existed, each good of its kind,--that all organs and instincts are, in ever so\nslight a degree, variable,--and, lastly, that there is a struggle for existence leading to the\npreservation of each profitable deviation of structure or instinct. The truth of these propositions\ncannot, I think, be disputed.\nIt is, no doubt, extremely difficult even to conjecture by what gradations many structures have\nbeen perfected, more especially amongst broken and failing groups of organic beings; but we see\nso many strange gradations in nature, as is proclaimed by the canon, \"Natura non facit saltum,\"\nthat we ought to be extremely cautious in saying that any organ or instinct, or any whole being,\ncould not have arrived at its present state by many graduated steps. There are, it must be\nadmitted, cases of special difficulty on the theory of natural selection; and one of the most\ncurious of these is the existence of two or three defined castes of workers or sterile females in the\nsame community of ants; but I have attempted to show how this difficulty can be mastered.\nWith respect to the almost universal sterility of species when first crossed, which forms so\nremarkable a contrast with the almost universal fertility of varieties when crossed, I must refer\nthe reader to the recapitulation of the facts given at the end of the eighth chapter, which seem to\nme conclusively to show that this sterility is no more a special endowment than is the incapacity\nof two trees to be grafted together, but that it is incidental on constitutional differences in the\nreproductive systems of the intercrossed species. We see the truth of this conclusion in the vast\ndifference in the result, when the same two species are crossed reciprocally; that is, when one\nspecies is first used as the father and then as the mother.\nThe fertility of varieties when intercrossed and of their mongrel offspring cannot be considered\nas universal; nor is their very general fertility surprising when we remember that it is not likely\nthat either their constitutions or their reproductive systems should have been profoundly\n\nmodified. Moreover, most of the varieties which have been experimentised on have been\nproduced under domestication; and as domestication apparently tends to eliminate sterility, we\nought not to expect it also to produce sterility.\nThe sterility of hybrids is a very different case from that of first crosses, for their reproductive\norgans are more or less functionally impotent; whereas in first crosses the organs on both sides\nare in a perfect condition. As we continually see that organisms of all kinds are rendered in some\ndegree sterile from their constitutions having been disturbed by slightly different and new\nconditions of life, we need not feel surprise at hybrids being in some degree sterile, for their\nconstitutions can hardly fail to have been disturbed from being compounded of two distinct\norganisations. This parallelism is supported by another parallel, but directly opposite, class of\nfacts; namely, that the vigour and fertility of all organic beings are increased by slight changes in\ntheir conditions of life, and that the offspring of slightly modified forms or varieties acquire from\nbeing crossed increased vigour and fertility. So that, on the one hand, considerable changes in the\nconditions of life and crosses between greatly modified forms, lessen fertility; and on the other\nhand, lesser changes in the conditions of life and crosses between less modified forms, increase\nfertility.\nTurning to geographical distribution, the difficulties encountered on the theory of descent with\nmodification are grave enough. All the individuals of the same species, and all the species of the\nsame genus, or even higher group, must have descended from common parents; and therefore, in\nhowever distant and isolated parts of the world they are now found, they must in the course of\nsuccessive generations have passed from some one part to the others. We are often wholly unable\neven to conjecture how this could have been effected. Yet, as we have reason to believe that\nsome species have retained the same specific form for very long periods, enormously long as\nmeasured by years, too much stress ought not to be laid on the occasional wide diffusion of the\nsame species; for during very long periods of time there will always be a good chance for wide\nmigration by many means. A broken or interrupted range may often be accounted for by the\nextinction of the species in the intermediate regions. It cannot be denied that we are as yet very\nignorant of the full extent of the various climatal and geographical changes which have affected\nthe earth during modern periods; and such changes will obviously have greatly facilitated\nmigration. As an example, I have attempted to show how potent has been the influence of the\nGlacial period on the distribution both of the same and of representative species throughout the\nworld. We are as yet profoundly ignorant of the many occasional means of transport. With\nrespect to distinct species of the same genus inhabiting very distant and isolated regions, as the\nprocess of modification has necessarily been slow, all the means of migration will have been\npossible during a very long period; and consequently the difficulty of the wide diffusion of\nspecies of the same genus is in some degree lessened.\nAs on the theory of natural selection an interminable number of intermediate forms must have\nexisted, linking together all the species in each group by gradations as fine as our present\nvarieties, it may be asked, Why do we not see these linking forms all around us? Why are not all\norganic beings blended together in an inextricable chaos? With respect to existing forms, we\nshould remember that we have no right to expect (excepting in rare cases) to discover\nDIRECTLY connecting links between them, but only between each and some extinct and\nsupplanted form. Even on a wide area, which has during a long period remained continuous, and\n\nof which the climate and other conditions of life change insensibly in going from a district\noccupied by one species into another district occupied by a closely allied species, we have no\njust right to expect often to find intermediate varieties in the intermediate zone. For we have\nreason to believe that only a few species are undergoing change at any one period; and all\nchanges are slowly effected. I have also shown that the intermediate varieties which will at first\nprobably exist in the intermediate zones, will be liable to be supplanted by the allied forms on\neither hand; and the latter, from existing in greater numbers, will generally be modified and\nimproved at a quicker rate than the intermediate varieties, which exist in lesser numbers; so that\nthe intermediate varieties will, in the long run, be supplanted and exterminated.\nOn this doctrine of the extermination of an infinitude of connecting links, between the living and\nextinct inhabitants of the world, and at each successive period between the extinct and still older\nspecies, why is not every geological formation charged with such links? Why does not every\ncollection of fossil remains afford plain evidence of the gradation and mutation of the forms of\nlife? We meet with no such evidence, and this is the most obvious and forcible of the many\nobjections which may be urged against my theory. Why, again, do whole groups of allied species\nappear, though certainly they often falsely appear, to have come in suddenly on the several\ngeological stages? Why do we not find great piles of strata beneath the Silurian system, stored\nwith the remains of the progenitors of the Silurian groups of fossils? For certainly on my theory\nsuch strata must somewhere have been deposited at these ancient and utterly unknown epochs in\nthe world's history.\nI can answer these questions and grave objections only on the supposition that the geological\nrecord is far more imperfect than most geologists believe. It cannot be objected that there has not\nbeen time sufficient for any amount of organic change; for the lapse of time has been so great as\nto be utterly inappreciable by the human intellect. The number of specimens in all our museums\nis absolutely as nothing compared with the countless generations of countless species which\ncertainly have existed. We should not be able to recognise a species as the parent of any one or\nmore species if we were to examine them ever so closely, unless we likewise possessed many of\nthe intermediate links between their past or parent and present states; and these many links we\ncould hardly ever expect to discover, owing to the imperfection of the geological record.\nNumerous existing doubtful forms could be named which are probably varieties; but who will\npretend that in future ages so many fossil links will be discovered, that naturalists will be able to\ndecide, on the common view, whether or not these doubtful forms are varieties? As long as most\nof the links between any two species are unknown, if any one link or intermediate variety be\ndiscovered, it will simply be classed as another and distinct species. Only a small portion of the\nworld has been geologically explored. Only organic beings of certain classes can be preserved in\na fossil condition, at least in any great number. Widely ranging species vary most, and varieties\nare often at first local,--both causes rendering the discovery of intermediate links less likely.\nLocal varieties will not spread into other and distant regions until they are considerably modified\nand improved; and when they do spread, if discovered in a geological formation, they will appear\nas if suddenly created there, and will be simply classed as new species. Most formations have\nbeen intermittent in their accumulation; and their duration, I am inclined to believe, has been\nshorter than the average duration of specific forms. Successive formations are separated from\neach other by enormous blank intervals of time; for fossiliferous formations, thick enough to\nresist future degradation, can be accumulated only where much sediment is deposited on the\n\nsubsiding bed of the sea. During the alternate periods of elevation and of stationary level the\nrecord will be blank. During these latter periods there will probably be more variability in the\nforms of life; during periods of subsidence, more extinction.\nWith respect to the absence of fossiliferous formations beneath the lowest Silurian strata, I can\nonly recur to the hypothesis given in the ninth chapter. That the geological record is imperfect all\nwill admit; but that it is imperfect to the degree which I require, few will be inclined to admit. If\nwe look to long enough intervals of time, geology plainly declares that all species have changed;\nand they have changed in the manner which my theory requires, for they have changed slowly\nand in a graduated manner. We clearly see this in the fossil remains from consecutive formations\ninvariably being much more closely related to each other, than are the fossils from formations\ndistant from each other in time.\nSuch is the sum of the several chief objections and difficulties which may justly be urged against\nmy theory; and I have now briefly recapitulated the answers and explanations which can be\ngiven to them. I have felt these difficulties far too heavily during many years to doubt their\nweight. But it deserves especial notice that the more important objections relate to questions on\nwhich we are confessedly ignorant; nor do we know how ignorant we are. We do not know all\nthe possible transitional gradations between the simplest and the most perfect organs; it cannot\nbe pretended that we know all the varied means of Distribution during the long lapse of years, or\nthat we know how imperfect the Geological Record is. Grave as these several difficulties are, in\nmy judgment they do not overthrow the theory of descent with modification.\nNow let us turn to the other side of the argument. Under domestication we see much variability.\nThis seems to be mainly due to the reproductive system being eminently susceptible to changes\nin the conditions of life; so that this system, when not rendered impotent, fails to reproduce\noffspring exactly like the parent-form. Variability is governed by many complex laws,--by\ncorrelation of growth, by use and disuse, and by the direct action of the physical conditions of\nlife. There is much difficulty in ascertaining how much modification our domestic productions\nhave undergone; but we may safely infer that the amount has been large, and that modifications\ncan be inherited for long periods. As long as the conditions of life remain the same, we have\nreason to believe that a modification, which has already been inherited for many generations,\nmay continue to be inherited for an almost infinite number of generations. On the other hand we\nhave evidence that variability, when it has once come into play, does not wholly cease; for new\nvarieties are still occasionally produced by our most anciently domesticated productions.\nMan does not actually produce variability; he only unintentionally exposes organic beings to new\nconditions of life, and then nature acts on the organisation, and causes variability. But man can\nand does select the variations given to him by nature, and thus accumulate them in any desired\nmanner. He thus adapts animals and plants for his own benefit or pleasure. He may do this\nmethodically, or he may do it unconsciously by preserving the individuals most useful to him at\nthe time, without any thought of altering the breed. It is certain that he can largely influence the\ncharacter of a breed by selecting, in each successive generation, individual differences so slight\nas to be quite inappreciable by an uneducated eye. This process of selection has been the great\nagency in the production of the most distinct and useful domestic breeds. That many of the\n\nbreeds produced by man have to a large extent the character of natural species, is shown by the\ninextricable doubts whether very many of them are varieties or aboriginal species.\nThere is no obvious reason why the principles which have acted so efficiently under\ndomestication should not have acted under nature. In the preservation of favoured individuals\nand races, during the constantly-recurrent Struggle for Existence, we see the most powerful and\never-acting means of selection. The struggle for existence inevitably follows from the high\ngeometrical ratio of increase which is common to all organic beings. This high rate of increase is\nproved by calculation, by the effects of a succession of peculiar seasons, and by the results of\nnaturalisation, as explained in the third chapter. More individuals are born than can possibly\nsurvive. A grain in the balance will determine which individual shall live and which shall die,--\nwhich variety or species shall increase in number, and which shall decrease, or finally become\nextinct. As the individuals of the same species come in all respects into the closest competition\nwith each other, the struggle will generally be most severe between them; it will be almost\nequally severe between the varieties of the same species, and next in severity between the species\nof the same genus. But the struggle will often be very severe between beings most remote in the\nscale of nature. The slightest advantage in one being, at any age or during any season, over those\nwith which it comes into competition, or better adaptation in however slight a degree to the\nsurrounding physical conditions, will turn the balance.\nWith animals having separated sexes there will in most cases be a struggle between the males for\npossession of the females. The most vigorous individuals, or those which have most successfully\nstruggled with their conditions of life, will generally leave most progeny. But success will often\ndepend on having special weapons or means of defence, or on the charms of the males; and the\nslightest advantage will lead to victory.\nAs geology plainly proclaims that each land has undergone great physical changes, we might\nhave expected that organic beings would have varied under nature, in the same way as they\ngenerally have varied under the changed conditions of domestication. And if there be any\nvariability under nature, it would be an unaccountable fact if natural selection had not come into\nplay. It has often been asserted, but the assertion is quite incapable of proof, that the amount of\nvariation under nature is a strictly limited quantity. Man, though acting on external characters\nalone and often capriciously, can produce within a short period a great result by adding up mere\nindividual differences in his domestic productions; and every one admits that there are at least\nindividual differences in species under nature. But, besides such differences, all naturalists have\nadmitted the existence of varieties, which they think sufficiently distinct to be worthy of record\nin systematic works. No one can draw any clear distinction between individual differences and\nslight varieties; or between more plainly marked varieties and sub-species, and species. Let it be\nobserved how naturalists differ in the rank which they assign to the many representative forms in\nEurope and North America.\nIf then we have under nature variability and a powerful agent always ready to act and select, why\nshould we doubt that variations in any way useful to beings, under their excessively complex\nrelations of life, would be preserved, accumulated, and inherited? Why, if man can by patience\nselect variations most useful to himself, should nature fail in selecting variations useful, under\nchanging conditions of life, to her living products? What limit can be put to this power, acting\n\nduring long ages and rigidly scrutinising the whole constitution, structure, and habits of each\ncreature,--favouring the good and rejecting the bad? I can see no limit to this power, in slowly\nand beautifully adapting each form to the most complex relations of life. The theory of natural\nselection, even if we looked no further than this, seems to me to be in itself probable. I have\nalready recapitulated, as fairly as I could, the opposed difficulties and objections: now let us turn\nto the special facts and arguments in favour of the theory.\nOn the view that species are only strongly marked and permanent varieties, and that each species\nfirst existed as a variety, we can see why it is that no line of demarcation can be drawn between\nspecies, commonly supposed to have been produced by special acts of creation, and varieties\nwhich are acknowledged to have been produced by secondary laws. On this same view we can\nunderstand how it is that in each region where many species of a genus have been produced, and\nwhere they now flourish, these same species should present many varieties; for where the\nmanufactory of species has been active, we might expect, as a general rule, to find it still in\naction; and this is the case if varieties be incipient species. Moreover, the species of the larger\ngenera, which afford the greater number of varieties or incipient species, retain to a certain\ndegree the character of varieties; for they differ from each other by a less amount of difference\nthan do the species of smaller genera. The closely allied species also of the larger genera\napparently have restricted ranges, and they are clustered in little groups round other species--in\nwhich respects they resemble varieties. These are strange relations on the view of each species\nhaving been independently created, but are intelligible if all species first existed as varieties.\nAs each species tends by its geometrical ratio of reproduction to increase inordinately in number;\nand as the modified descendants of each species will be enabled to increase by so much the more\nas they become more diversified in habits and structure, so as to be enabled to seize on many and\nwidely different places in the economy of nature, there will be a constant tendency in natural\nselection to preserve the most divergent offspring of any one species. Hence during a long-\ncontinued course of modification, the slight differences, characteristic of varieties of the same\nspecies, tend to be augmented into the greater differences characteristic of species of the same\ngenus. New and improved varieties will inevitably supplant and exterminate the older, less\nimproved and intermediate varieties; and thus species are rendered to a large extent defined and\ndistinct objects. Dominant species belonging to the larger groups tend to give birth to new and\ndominant forms; so that each large group tends to become still larger, and at the same time more\ndivergent in character. But as all groups cannot thus succeed in increasing in size, for the world\nwould not hold them, the more dominant groups beat the less dominant. This tendency in the\nlarge groups to go on increasing in size and diverging in character, together with the almost\ninevitable contingency of much extinction, explains the arrangement of all the forms of life, in\ngroups subordinate to groups, all within a few great classes, which we now see everywhere\naround us, and which has prevailed throughout all time. This grand fact of the grouping of all\norganic beings seems to me utterly inexplicable on the theory of creation.\nAs natural selection acts solely by accumulating slight, successive, favourable variations, it can\nproduce no great or sudden modification; it can act only by very short and slow steps. Hence the\ncanon of \"Natura non facit saltum,\" which every fresh addition to our knowledge tends to make\nmore strictly correct, is on this theory simply intelligible. We can plainly see why nature is\n\nprodigal in variety, though niggard in innovation. But why this should be a law of nature if each\nspecies has been independently created, no man can explain.\nMany other facts are, as it seems to me, explicable on this theory. How strange it is that a bird,\nunder the form of woodpecker, should have been created to prey on insects on the ground; that\nupland geese, which never or rarely swim, should have been created with webbed feet; that a\nthrush should have been created to dive and feed on sub-aquatic insects; and that a petrel should\nhave been created with habits and structure fitting it for the life of an auk or grebe! and so on in\nendless other cases. But on the view of each species constantly trying to increase in number, with\nnatural selection always ready to adapt the slowly varying descendants of each to any\nunoccupied or ill-occupied place in nature, these facts cease to be strange, or perhaps might even\nhave been anticipated.\nAs natural selection acts by competition, it adapts the inhabitants of each country only in relation\nto the degree of perfection of their associates; so that we need feel no surprise at the inhabitants\nof any one country, although on the ordinary view supposed to have been specially created and\nadapted for that country, being beaten and supplanted by the naturalised productions from\nanother land. Nor ought we to marvel if all the contrivances in nature be not, as far as we can\njudge, absolutely perfect; and if some of them be abhorrent to our ideas of fitness. We need not\nmarvel at the sting of the bee causing the bee's own death; at drones being produced in such vast\nnumbers for one single act, and being then slaughtered by their sterile sisters; at the astonishing\nwaste of pollen by our fir-trees; at the instinctive hatred of the queen bee for her own fertile\ndaughters; at ichneumonidae feeding within the live bodies of caterpillars; and at other such\ncases. The wonder indeed is, on the theory of natural selection, that more cases of the want of\nabsolute perfection have not been observed.\nThe complex and little known laws governing variation are the same, as far as we can see, with\nthe laws which have governed the production of so-called specific forms. In both cases physical\nconditions seem to have produced but little direct effect; yet when varieties enter any zone, they\noccasionally assume some of the characters of the species proper to that zone. In both varieties\nand species, use and disuse seem to have produced some effect; for it is difficult to resist this\nconclusion when we look, for instance, at the logger-headed duck, which has wings incapable of\nflight, in nearly the same condition as in the domestic duck; or when we look at the burrowing\ntucutucu, which is occasionally blind, and then at certain moles, which are habitually blind and\nhave their eyes covered with skin; or when we look at the blind animals inhabiting the dark caves\nof America and Europe. In both varieties and species correlation of growth seems to have played\na most important part, so that when one part has been modified other parts are necessarily\nmodified. In both varieties and species reversions to long-lost characters occur. How inexplicable\non the theory of creation is the occasional appearance of stripes on the shoulder and legs of the\nseveral species of the horse-genus and in their hybrids! How simply is this fact explained if we\nbelieve that these species have descended from a striped progenitor, in the same manner as the\nseveral domestic breeds of pigeon have descended from the blue and barred rock-pigeon!\nOn the ordinary view of each species having been independently created, why should the specific\ncharacters, or those by which the species of the same genus differ from each other, be more\nvariable than the generic characters in which they all agree? Why, for instance, should the colour\n\nof a flower be more likely to vary in any one species of a genus, if the other species, supposed to\nhave been created independently, have differently coloured flowers, than if all the species of the\ngenus have the same coloured flowers? If species are only well-marked varieties, of which the\ncharacters have become in a high degree permanent, we can understand this fact; for they have\nalready varied since they branched off from a common progenitor in certain characters, by which\nthey have come to be specifically distinct from each other; and therefore these same characters\nwould be more likely still to be variable than the generic characters which have been inherited\nwithout change for an enormous period. It is inexplicable on the theory of creation why a part\ndeveloped in a very unusual manner in any one species of a genus, and therefore, as we may\nnaturally infer, of great importance to the species, should be eminently liable to variation; but, on\nmy view, this part has undergone, since the several species branched off from a common\nprogenitor, an unusual amount of variability and modification, and therefore we might expect\nthis part generally to be still variable. But a part may be developed in the most unusual manner,\nlike the wing of a bat, and yet not be more variable than any other structure, if the part be\ncommon to many subordinate forms, that is, if it has been inherited for a very long period; for in\nthis case it will have been rendered constant by long-continued natural selection.\nGlancing at instincts, marvellous as some are, they offer no greater difficulty than does corporeal\nstructure on the theory of the natural selection of successive, slight, but profitable modifications.\nWe can thus understand why nature moves by graduated steps in endowing different animals of\nthe same class with their several instincts. I have attempted to show how much light the principle\nof gradation throws on the admirable architectural powers of the hive-bee. Habit no doubt\nsometimes comes into play in modifying instincts; but it certainly is not indispensable, as we see,\nin the case of neuter insects, which leave no progeny to inherit the effects of long-continued\nhabit. On the view of all the species of the same genus having descended from a common parent,\nand having inherited much in common, we can understand how it is that allied species, when\nplaced under considerably different conditions of life, yet should follow nearly the same\ninstincts; why the thrush of South America, for instance, lines her nest with mud like our British\nspecies. On the view of instincts having been slowly acquired through natural selection we need\nnot marvel at some instincts being apparently not perfect and liable to mistakes, and at many\ninstincts causing other animals to suffer.\nIf species be only well-marked and permanent varieties, we can at once see why their crossed\noffspring should follow the same complex laws in their degrees and kinds of resemblance to their\nparents,--in being absorbed into each other by successive crosses, and in other such points,--as\ndo the crossed offspring of acknowledged varieties. On the other hand, these would be strange\nfacts if species have been independently created, and varieties have been produced by secondary\nlaws.\nIf we admit that the geological record is imperfect in an extreme degree, then such facts as the\nrecord gives, support the theory of descent with modification. New species have come on the\nstage slowly and at successive intervals; and the amount of change, after equal intervals of time,\nis widely different in different groups. The extinction of species and of whole groups of species,\nwhich has played so conspicuous a part in the history of the organic world, almost inevitably\nfollows on the principle of natural selection; for old forms will be supplanted by new and\nimproved forms. Neither single species nor groups of species reappear when the chain of\n\nordinary generation has once been broken. The gradual diffusion of dominant forms, with the\nslow modification of their descendants, causes the forms of life, after long intervals of time, to\nappear as if they had changed simultaneously throughout the world. The fact of the fossil\nremains of each formation being in some degree intermediate in character between the fossils in\nthe formations above and below, is simply explained by their intermediate position in the chain\nof descent. The grand fact that all extinct organic beings belong to the same system with recent\nbeings, falling either into the same or into intermediate groups, follows from the living and the\nextinct being the offspring of common parents. As the groups which have descended from an\nancient progenitor have generally diverged in character, the progenitor with its early descendants\nwill often be intermediate in character in comparison with its later descendants; and thus we can\nsee why the more ancient a fossil is, the oftener it stands in some degree intermediate between\nexisting and allied groups. Recent forms are generally looked at as being, in some vague sense,\nhigher than ancient and extinct forms; and they are in so far higher as the later and more\nimproved forms have conquered the older and less improved organic beings in the struggle for\nlife. Lastly, the law of the long endurance of allied forms on the same continent,--of marsupials\nin Australia, of edentata in America, and other such cases,--is intelligible, for within a confined\ncountry, the recent and the extinct will naturally be allied by descent.\nLooking to geographical distribution, if we admit that there has been during the long course of\nages much migration from one part of the world to another, owing to former climatal and\ngeographical changes and to the many occasional and unknown means of dispersal, then we can\nunderstand, on the theory of descent with modification, most of the great leading facts in\nDistribution. We can see why there should be so striking a parallelism in the distribution of\norganic beings throughout space, and in their geological succession throughout time; for in both\ncases the beings have been connected by the bond of ordinary generation, and the means of\nmodification have been the same. We see the full meaning of the wonderful fact, which must\nhave struck every traveller, namely, that on the same continent, under the most diverse\nconditions, under heat and cold, on mountain and lowland, on deserts and marshes, most of the\ninhabitants within each great class are plainly related; for they will generally be descendants of\nthe same progenitors and early colonists. On this same principle of former migration, combined\nin most cases with modification, we can understand, by the aid of the Glacial period, the identity\nof some few plants, and the close alliance of many others, on the most distant mountains, under\nthe most different climates; and likewise the close alliance of some of the inhabitants of the sea\nin the northern and southern temperate zones, though separated by the whole intertropical ocean.\nAlthough two areas may present the same physical conditions of life, we need feel no surprise at\ntheir inhabitants being widely different, if they have been for a long period completely separated\nfrom each other; for as the relation of organism to organism is the most important of all relations,\nand as the two areas will have received colonists from some third source or from each other, at\nvarious periods and in different proportions, the course of modification in the two areas will\ninevitably be different.\nOn this view of migration, with subsequent modification, we can see why oceanic islands should\nbe inhabited by few species, but of these, that many should be peculiar. We can clearly see why\nthose animals which cannot cross wide spaces of ocean, as frogs and terrestrial mammals, should\nnot inhabit oceanic islands; and why, on the other hand, new and peculiar species of bats, which\ncan traverse the ocean, should so often be found on islands far distant from any continent. Such\n\nfacts as the presence of peculiar species of bats, and the absence of all other mammals, on\noceanic islands, are utterly inexplicable on the theory of independent acts of creation.\nThe existence of closely allied or representative species in any two areas, implies, on the theory\nof descent with modification, that the same parents formerly inhabited both areas; and we almost\ninvariably find that wherever many closely allied species inhabit two areas, some identical\nspecies common to both still exist. Wherever many closely allied yet distinct species occur,\nmany doubtful forms and varieties of the same species likewise occur. It is a rule of high\ngenerality that the inhabitants of each area are related to the inhabitants of the nearest source\nwhence immigrants might have been derived. We see this in nearly all the plants and animals of\nthe Galapagos archipelago, of Juan Fernandez, and of the other American islands being related in\nthe most striking manner to the plants and animals of the neighbouring American mainland; and\nthose of the Cape de Verde archipelago and other African islands to the African mainland. It\nmust be admitted that these facts receive no explanation on the theory of creation.\nThe fact, as we have seen, that all past and present organic beings constitute one grand natural\nsystem, with group subordinate to group, and with extinct groups often falling in between recent\ngroups, is intelligible on the theory of natural selection with its contingencies of extinction and\ndivergence of character. On these same principles we see how it is, that the mutual affinities of\nthe species and genera within each class are so complex and circuitous. We see why certain\ncharacters are far more serviceable than others for classification;--why adaptive characters,\nthough of paramount importance to the being, are of hardly any importance in classification; why\ncharacters derived from rudimentary parts, though of no service to the being, are often of high\nclassificatory value; and why embryological characters are the most valuable of all. The real\naffinities of all organic beings are due to inheritance or community of descent. The natural\nsystem is a genealogical arrangement, in which we have to discover the lines of descent by the\nmost permanent characters, however slight their vital importance may be.\nThe framework of bones being the same in the hand of a man, wing of a bat, fin of the porpoise,\nand leg of the horse,--the same number of vertebrae forming the neck of the giraffe and of the\nelephant,--and innumerable other such facts, at once explain themselves on the theory of descent\nwith slow and slight successive modifications. The similarity of pattern in the wing and leg of a\nbat, though used for such different purpose,--in the jaws and legs of a crab,--in the petals,\nstamens, and pistils of a flower, is likewise intelligible on the view of the gradual modification of\nparts or organs, which were alike in the early progenitor of each class. On the principle of\nsuccessive variations not always supervening at an early age, and being inherited at a\ncorresponding not early period of life, we can clearly see why the embryos of mammals, birds,\nreptiles, and fishes should be so closely alike, and should be so unlike the adult forms. We may\ncease marvelling at the embryo of an air-breathing mammal or bird having branchial slits and\narteries running in loops, like those in a fish which has to breathe the air dissolved in water, by\nthe aid of well-developed branchiae.\nDisuse, aided sometimes by natural selection, will often tend to reduce an organ, when it has\nbecome useless by changed habits or under changed conditions of life; and we can clearly\nunderstand on this view the meaning of rudimentary organs. But disuse and selection will\ngenerally act on each creature, when it has come to maturity and has to play its full part in the\n\nstruggle for existence, and will thus have little power of acting on an organ during early life;\nhence the organ will not be much reduced or rendered rudimentary at this early age. The calf, for\ninstance, has inherited teeth, which never cut through the gums of the upper jaw, from an early\nprogenitor having well-developed teeth; and we may believe, that the teeth in the mature animal\nwere reduced, during successive generations, by disuse or by the tongue and palate having been\nfitted by natural selection to browse without their aid; whereas in the calf, the teeth have been\nleft untouched by selection or disuse, and on the principle of inheritance at corresponding ages\nhave been inherited from a remote period to the present day. On the view of each organic being\nand each separate organ having been specially created, how utterly inexplicable it is that parts,\nlike the teeth in the embryonic calf or like the shrivelled wings under the soldered wing-covers of\nsome beetles, should thus so frequently bear the plain stamp of inutility! Nature may be said to\nhave taken pains to reveal, by rudimentary organs and by homologous structures, her scheme of\nmodification, which it seems that we wilfully will not understand.\nI have now recapitulated the chief facts and considerations which have thoroughly convinced me\nthat species have changed, and are still slowly changing by the preservation and accumulation of\nsuccessive slight favourable variations. Why, it may be asked, have all the most eminent living\nnaturalists and geologists rejected this view of the mutability of species? It cannot be asserted\nthat organic beings in a state of nature are subject to no variation; it cannot be proved that the\namount of variation in the course of long ages is a limited quantity; no clear distinction has been,\nor can be, drawn between species and well-marked varieties. It cannot be maintained that species\nwhen intercrossed are invariably sterile, and varieties invariably fertile; or that sterility is a\nspecial endowment and sign of creation. The belief that species were immutable productions was\nalmost unavoidable as long as the history of the world was thought to be of short duration; and\nnow that we have acquired some idea of the lapse of time, we are too apt to assume, without\nproof, that the geological record is so perfect that it would have afforded us plain evidence of the\nmutation of species, if they had undergone mutation.\nBut the chief cause of our natural unwillingness to admit that one species has given birth to other\nand distinct species, is that we are always slow in admitting any great change of which we do not\nsee the intermediate steps. The difficulty is the same as that felt by so many geologists, when\nLyell first insisted that long lines of inland cliffs had been formed, and great valleys excavated,\nby the slow action of the coast-waves. The mind cannot possibly grasp the full meaning of the\nterm of a hundred million years; it cannot add up and perceive the full effects of many slight\nvariations, accumulated during an almost infinite number of generations.\nAlthough I am fully convinced of the truth of the views given in this volume under the form of\nan abstract, I by no means expect to convince experienced naturalists whose minds are stocked\nwith a multitude of facts all viewed, during a long course of years, from a point of view directly\nopposite to mine. It is so easy to hide our ignorance under such expressions as the \"plan of\ncreation,\" \"unity of design,\" etc., and to think that we give an explanation when we only restate a\nfact. Any one whose disposition leads him to attach more weight to unexplained difficulties than\nto the explanation of a certain number of facts will certainly reject my theory. A few naturalists,\nendowed with much flexibility of mind, and who have already begun to doubt on the\nimmutability of species, may be influenced by this volume; but I look with confidence to the\nfuture, to young and rising naturalists, who will be able to view both sides of the question with\n\nimpartiality. Whoever is led to believe that species are mutable will do good service by\nconscientiously expressing his conviction; for only thus can the load of prejudice by which this\nsubject is overwhelmed be removed.\nSeveral eminent naturalists have of late published their belief that a multitude of reputed species\nin each genus are not real species; but that other species are real, that is, have been independently\ncreated. This seems to me a strange conclusion to arrive at. They admit that a multitude of forms,\nwhich till lately they themselves thought were special creations, and which are still thus looked\nat by the majority of naturalists, and which consequently have every external characteristic\nfeature of true species,--they admit that these have been produced by variation, but they refuse\nto extend the same view to other and very slightly different forms. Nevertheless they do not\npretend that they can define, or even conjecture, which are the created forms of life, and which\nare those produced by secondary laws. They admit variation as a vera causa in one case, they\narbitrarily reject it in another, without assigning any distinction in the two cases. The day will\ncome when this will be given as a curious illustration of the blindness of preconceived opinion.\nThese authors seem no more startled at a miraculous act of creation than at an ordinary birth. But\ndo they really believe that at innumerable periods in the earth's history certain elemental atoms\nhave been commanded suddenly to flash into living tissues? Do they believe that at each\nsupposed act of creation one individual or many were produced? Were all the infinitely\nnumerous kinds of animals and plants created as eggs or seed, or as full grown? and in the case\nof mammals, were they created bearing the false marks of nourishment from the mother's womb?\nAlthough naturalists very properly demand a full explanation of every difficulty from those who\nbelieve in the mutability of species, on their own side they ignore the whole subject of the first\nappearance of species in what they consider reverent silence.\nIt may be asked how far I extend the doctrine of the modification of species. The question is\ndifficult to answer, because the more distinct the forms are which we may consider, by so much\nthe arguments fall away in force. But some arguments of the greatest weight extend very far. All\nthe members of whole classes can be connected together by chains of affinities, and all can be\nclassified on the same principle, in groups subordinate to groups. Fossil remains sometimes tend\nto fill up very wide intervals between existing orders. Organs in a rudimentary condition plainly\nshow that an early progenitor had the organ in a fully developed state; and this in some instances\nnecessarily implies an enormous amount of modification in the descendants. Throughout whole\nclasses various structures are formed on the same pattern, and at an embryonic age the species\nclosely resemble each other. Therefore I cannot doubt that the theory of descent with\nmodification embraces all the members of the same class. I believe that animals have descended\nfrom at most only four or five progenitors, and plants from an equal or lesser number.\nAnalogy would lead me one step further, namely, to the belief that all animals and plants have\ndescended from some one prototype. But analogy may be a deceitful guide. Nevertheless all\nliving things have much in common, in their chemical composition, their germinal vesicles, their\ncellular structure, and their laws of growth and reproduction. We see this even in so trifling a\ncircumstance as that the same poison often similarly affects plants and animals; or that the\npoison secreted by the gall-fly produces monstrous growths on the wild rose or oak-tree.\nTherefore I should infer from analogy that probably all the organic beings which have ever lived\non this earth have descended from some one primordial form, into which life was first breathed.\n\nWhen the views entertained in this volume on the origin of species, or when analogous views are\ngenerally admitted, we can dimly foresee that there will be a considerable revolution in natural\nhistory. Systematists will be able to pursue their labours as at present; but they will not be\nincessantly haunted by the shadowy doubt whether this or that form be in essence a species. This\nI feel sure, and I speak after experience, will be no slight relief. The endless disputes whether or\nnot some fifty species of British brambles are true species will cease. Systematists will have only\nto decide (not that this will be easy) whether any form be sufficiently constant and distinct from\nother forms, to be capable of definition; and if definable, whether the differences be sufficiently\nimportant to deserve a specific name. This latter point will become a far more essential\nconsideration than it is at present; for differences, however slight, between any two forms, if not\nblended by intermediate gradations, are looked at by most naturalists as sufficient to raise both\nforms to the rank of species. Hereafter we shall be compelled to acknowledge that the only\ndistinction between species and well-marked varieties is, that the latter are known, or believed, to\nbe connected at the present day by intermediate gradations, whereas species were formerly thus\nconnected. Hence, without quite rejecting the consideration of the present existence of\nintermediate gradations between any two forms, we shall be led to weigh more carefully and to\nvalue higher the actual amount of difference between them. It is quite possible that forms now\ngenerally acknowledged to be merely varieties may hereafter be thought worthy of specific\nnames, as with the primrose and cowslip; and in this case scientific and common language will\ncome into accordance. In short, we shall have to treat species in the same manner as those\nnaturalists treat genera, who admit that genera are merely artificial combinations made for\nconvenience. This may not be a cheering prospect; but we shall at least be freed from the vain\nsearch for the undiscovered and undiscoverable essence of the term species.\nThe other and more general departments of natural history will rise greatly in interest. The terms\nused by naturalists of affinity, relationship, community of type, paternity, morphology, adaptive\ncharacters, rudimentary and aborted organs, etc., will cease to be metaphorical, and will have a\nplain signification. When we no longer look at an organic being as a savage looks at a ship, as at\nsomething wholly beyond his comprehension; when we regard every production of nature as one\nwhich has had a history; when we contemplate every complex structure and instinct as the\nsumming up of many contrivances, each useful to the possessor, nearly in the same way as when\nwe look at any great mechanical invention as the summing up of the labour, the experience, the\nreason, and even the blunders of numerous workmen; when we thus view each organic being,\nhow far more interesting, I speak from experience, will the study of natural history become!\nA grand and almost untrodden field of inquiry will be opened, on the causes and laws of\nvariation, on correlation of growth, on the effects of use and disuse, on the direct action of\nexternal conditions, and so forth. The study of domestic productions will rise immensely in\nvalue. A new variety raised by man will be a far more important and interesting subject for study\nthan one more species added to the infinitude of already recorded species. Our classifications\nwill come to be, as far as they can be so made, genealogies; and will then truly give what may be\ncalled the plan of creation. The rules for classifying will no doubt become simpler when we have\na definite object in view. We possess no pedigrees or armorial bearings; and we have to discover\nand trace the many diverging lines of descent in our natural genealogies, by characters of any\nkind which have long been inherited. Rudimentary organs will speak infallibly with respect to\nthe nature of long-lost structures. Species and groups of species, which are called aberrant, and\n\nwhich may fancifully be called living fossils, will aid us in forming a picture of the ancient forms\nof life. Embryology will reveal to us the structure, in some degree obscured, of the prototypes of\neach great class.\nWhen we can feel assured that all the individuals of the same species, and all the closely allied\nspecies of most genera, have within a not very remote period descended from one parent, and\nhave migrated from some one birthplace; and when we better know the many means of\nmigration, then, by the light which geology now throws, and will continue to throw, on former\nchanges of climate and of the level of the land, we shall surely be enabled to trace in an\nadmirable manner the former migrations of the inhabitants of the whole world. Even at present,\nby comparing the differences of the inhabitants of the sea on the opposite sides of a continent,\nand the nature of the various inhabitants of that continent in relation to their apparent means of\nimmigration, some light can be thrown on ancient geography.\nThe noble science of Geology loses glory from the extreme imperfection of the record. The crust\nof the earth with its embedded remains must not be looked at as a well-filled museum, but as a\npoor collection made at hazard and at rare intervals. The accumulation of each great fossiliferous\nformation will be recognised as having depended on an unusual concurrence of circumstances,\nand the blank intervals between the successive stages as having been of vast duration. But we\nshall be able to gauge with some security the duration of these intervals by a comparison of the\npreceding and succeeding organic forms. We must be cautious in attempting to correlate as\nstrictly contemporaneous two formations, which include few identical species, by the general\nsuccession of their forms of life. As species are produced and exterminated by slowly acting and\nstill existing causes, and not by miraculous acts of creation and by catastrophes; and as the most\nimportant of all causes of organic change is one which is almost independent of altered and\nperhaps suddenly altered physical conditions, namely, the mutual relation of organism to\norganism,--the improvement of one being entailing the improvement or the extermination of\nothers; it follows, that the amount of organic change in the fossils of consecutive formations\nprobably serves as a fair measure of the lapse of actual time. A number of species, however,\nkeeping in a body might remain for a long period unchanged, whilst within this same period,\nseveral of these species, by migrating into new countries and coming into competition with\nforeign associates, might become modified; so that we must not overrate the accuracy of organic\nchange as a measure of time. During early periods of the earth's history, when the forms of life\nwere probably fewer and simpler, the rate of change was probably slower; and at the first dawn\nof life, when very few forms of the simplest structure existed, the rate of change may have been\nslow in an extreme degree. The whole history of the world, as at present known, although of a\nlength quite incomprehensible by us, will hereafter be recognised as a mere fragment of time,\ncompared with the ages which have elapsed since the first creature, the progenitor of\ninnumerable extinct and living descendants, was created.\nIn the distant future I see open fields for far more important researches. Psychology will be based\non a new foundation, that of the necessary acquirement of each mental power and capacity by\ngradation. Light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history.\nAuthors of the highest eminence seem to be fully satisfied with the view that each species has\nbeen independently created. To my mind it accords better with what we know of the laws\n\nimpressed on matter by the Creator, that the production and extinction of the past and present\ninhabitants of the world should have been due to secondary causes, like those determining the\nbirth and death of the individual. When I view all beings not as special creations, but as the lineal\ndescendants of some few beings which lived long before the first bed of the Silurian system was\ndeposited, they seem to me to become ennobled. Judging from the past, we may safely infer that\nnot one living species will transmit its unaltered likeness to a distant futurity. And of the species\nnow living very few will transmit progeny of any kind to a far distant futurity; for the manner in\nwhich all organic beings are grouped, shows that the greater number of species of each genus,\nand all the species of many genera, have left no descendants, but have become utterly extinct.\nWe can so far take a prophetic glance into futurity as to foretel that it will be the common and\nwidely-spread species, belonging to the larger and dominant groups, which will ultimately\nprevail and procreate new and dominant species. As all the living forms of life are the lineal\ndescendants of those which lived long before the Silurian epoch, we may feel certain that the\nordinary succession by generation has never once been broken, and that no cataclysm has\ndesolated the whole world. Hence we may look with some confidence to a secure future of\nequally inappreciable length. And as natural selection works solely by and for the good of each\nbeing, all corporeal and mental endowments will tend to progress towards perfection.\nIt is interesting to contemplate an entangled bank, clothed with many plants of many kinds, with\nbirds singing on the bushes, with various insects flitting about, and with worms crawling through\nthe damp earth, and to reflect that these elaborately constructed forms, so different from each\nother, and dependent on each other in so complex a manner, have all been produced by laws\nacting around us. These laws, taken in the largest sense, being Growth with Reproduction;\nInheritance which is almost implied by reproduction; Variability from the indirect and direct\naction of the external conditions of life, and from use and disuse; a Ratio of Increase so high as\nto lead to a Struggle for Life, and as a consequence to Natural Selection, entailing Divergence of\nCharacter and the Extinction of less-improved forms. Thus, from the war of nature, from famine\nand death, the most exalted object which we are capable of conceiving, namely, the production\nof the higher animals, directly follows. There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several\npowers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet\nhas gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless\nforms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\nSTS.003 The Rise of Modern Science\nFall 2010\n\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

      "content": "From Physics, by Aristotle\nWritten 350 B.C.E\nTranslated by R. P. Hardie and R. K. Gaye (now in public domain)\nText source: http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/physics.html\nBook III\nPart 1\nNature has been defined as a 'principle of motion and change', and it is the subject of our inquiry.\nWe must therefore see that we understand the meaning of 'motion'; for if it were unknown, the\nmeaning of 'nature' too would be unknown.\nWhen we have determined the nature of motion, our next task will be to attack in the same way\nthe terms which are involved in it. Now motion is supposed to belong to the class of things\nwhich are continuous; and the infinite presents itself first in the continuous-that is how it comes\nabout that 'infinite' is often used in definitions of the continuous ('what is infinitely divisible is\ncontinuous'). Besides these, place, void, and time are thought to be necessary conditions of\nmotion.\nClearly, then, for these reasons and also because the attributes mentioned are common to, and\ncoextensive with, all the objects of our science, we must first take each of them in hand and\ndiscuss it. For the investigation of special attributes comes after that of the common attributes.\nTo begin then, as we said, with motion.\nWe may start by distinguishing (1) what exists in a state of fulfilment only, (2) what exists as\npotential, (3) what exists as potential and also in fulfilment-one being a 'this', another 'so much', a\nthird 'such', and similarly in each of the other modes of the predication of being.\nFurther, the word 'relative' is used with reference to (1) excess and defect, (2) agent and patient\nand generally what can move and what can be moved. For 'what can cause movement' is relative\nto 'what can be moved', and vice versa.\nAgain, there is no such thing as motion over and above the things. It is always with respect to\nsubstance or to quantity or to quality or to place that what changes changes. But it is impossible,\nas we assert, to find anything common to these which is neither 'this' nor quantum nor quale nor\nany of the other predicates. Hence neither will motion and change have reference to something\nover and above the things mentioned, for there is nothing over and above them.\nNow each of these belongs to all its subjects in either of two ways: namely (1) substance-the one\nis positive form, the other privation; (2) in quality, white and black; (3) in quantity, complete and\n\nincomplete; (4) in respect of locomotion, upwards and downwards or light and heavy. Hence\nthere are as many types of motion or change as there are meanings of the word 'is'.\nWe have now before us the distinctions in the various classes of being between what is full real\nand what is potential.\nDef. The fulfilment of what exists potentially, in so far as it exists potentially, is motion-namely,\nof what is alterable qua alterable, alteration: of what can be increased and its opposite what can\nbe decreased (there is no common name), increase and decrease: of what can come to be and can\npass away, coming to he and passing away: of what can be carried along, locomotion.\nExamples will elucidate this definition of motion. When the buildable, in so far as it is just that,\nis fully real, it is being built, and this is building. Similarly, learning, doctoring, rolling, leaping,\nripening, ageing.\nThe same thing, if it is of a certain kind, can be both potential and fully real, not indeed at the\nsame time or not in the same respect, but e.g. potentially hot and actually cold. Hence at once\nsuch things will act and be acted on by one another in many ways: each of them will be capable\nat the same time of causing alteration and of being altered. Hence, too, what effects motion as a\nphysical agent can be moved: when a thing of this kind causes motion, it is itself also moved.\nThis, indeed, has led some people to suppose that every mover is moved. But this question\ndepends on another set of arguments, and the truth will be made clear later. is possible for a thing\nto cause motion, though it is itself incapable of being moved.\nIt is the fulfilment of what is potential when it is already fully real and operates not as itself but\nas movable, that is motion. What I mean by 'as' is this: Bronze is potentially a statue. But it is not\nthe fulfilment of bronze as bronze which is motion. For 'to be bronze' and 'to be a certain\npotentiality' are not the same.\nIf they were identical without qualification, i.e. in definition, the fulfilment of bronze as bronze\nwould have been motion. But they are not the same, as has been said. (This is obvious in\ncontraries. 'To be capable of health' and 'to be capable of illness' are not the same, for if they\nwere there would be no difference between being ill and being well. Yet the subject both of\nhealth and of sickness-whether it is humour or blood-is one and the same.)\nWe can distinguish, then, between the two-just as, to give another example, 'colour' and visible'\nare different-and clearly it is the fulfilment of what is potential as potential that is motion. So\nthis, precisely, is motion.\nFurther it is evident that motion is an attribute of a thing just when it is fully real in this way, and\n\nneither before nor after. For each thing of this kind is capable of being at one time actual, at\nanother not. Take for instance the buildable as buildable. The actuality of the buildable as\nbuildable is the process of building. For the actuality of the buildable must be either this or the\nhouse. But when there is a house, the buildable is no longer buildable. On the other hand, it is the\nbuildable which is being built. The process then of being built must be the kind of actuality\nrequired But building is a kind of motion, and the same account will apply to the other kinds\nalso.\nPart 2\nThe soundness of this definition is evident both when we consider the accounts of motion that\nthe others have given, and also from the difficulty of defining it otherwise.\nOne could not easily put motion and change in another genus-this is plain if we consider where\nsome people put it; they identify motion with or 'inequality' or 'not being'; but such things are not\nnecessarily moved, whether they are 'different' or 'unequal' or 'non-existent'; Nor is change either\nto or from these rather than to or from their opposites.\nThe reason why they put motion into these genera is that it is thought to be something indefinite,\nand the principles in the second column are indefinite because they are privative: none of them is\neither 'this' or 'such' or comes under any of the other modes of predication. The reason in turn\nwhy motion is thought to be indefinite is that it cannot be classed simply as a potentiality or as an\nactuality-a thing that is merely capable of having a certain size is not undergoing change, nor yet\na thing that is actually of a certain size, and motion is thought to be a sort of actuality, but\nincomplete, the reason for this view being that the potential whose actuality it is is incomplete.\nThis is why it is hard to grasp what motion is. It is necessary to class it with privation or with\npotentiality or with sheer actuality, yet none of these seems possible. There remains then the\nsuggested mode of definition, namely that it is a sort of actuality, or actuality of the kind\ndescribed, hard to grasp, but not incapable of existing.\nThe mover too is moved, as has been said-every mover, that is, which is capable of motion, and\nwhose immobility is rest-when a thing is subject to motion its immobility is rest. For to act on\nthe movable as such is just to move it. But this it does by contact, so that at the same time it is\nalso acted on. Hence we can define motion as the fulfilment of the movable qua movable, the\ncause of the attribute being contact with what can move so that the mover is also acted on. The\nmover or agent will always be the vehicle of a form, either a 'this' or 'such', which, when it acts,\nwill be the source and cause of the change, e.g. the full-formed man begets man from what is\npotentially man.\nPart 3\n\nThe solution of the difficulty that is raised about the motion-whether it is in the movable-is plain.\nIt is the fulfilment of this potentiality, and by the action of that which has the power of causing\nmotion; and the actuality of that which has the power of causing motion is not other than the\nactuality of the movable, for it must be the fulfilment of both. A thing is capable of causing\nmotion because it can do this, it is a mover because it actually does it. But it is on the movable\nthat it is capable of acting. Hence there is a single actuality of both alike, just as one to two and\ntwo to one are the same interval, and the steep ascent and the steep descent are one-for these are\none and the same, although they can be described in different ways. So it is with the mover and\nthe moved.\nThis view has a dialectical difficulty. Perhaps it is necessary that the actuality of the agent and\nthat of the patient should not be the same. The one is 'agency' and the other 'patiency'; and the\noutcome and completion of the one is an 'action', that of the other a 'passion'. Since then they are\nboth motions, we may ask: in what are they, if they are different? Either (a) both are in what is\nacted on and moved, or (b) the agency is in the agent and the patiency in the patient. (If we ought\nto call the latter also 'agency', the word would be used in two senses.)\nNow, in alternative (b), the motion will be in the mover, for the same statement will hold of\n'mover' and 'moved'. Hence either every mover will be moved, or, though having motion, it will\nnot be moved.\nIf on the other hand (a) both are in what is moved and acted on-both the agency and the patiency\n(e.g. both teaching and learning, though they are two, in the learner), then, first, the actuality of\neach will not be present in each, and, a second absurdity, a thing will have two motions at the\nsame time. How will there be two alterations of quality in one subject towards one definite\nquality? The thing is impossible: the actualization will be one.\nBut (some one will say) it is contrary to reason to suppose that there should be one identical\nactualization of two things which are different in kind. Yet there will be, if teaching and learning\nare the same, and agency and patiency. To teach will be the same as to learn, and to act the same\nas to be acted on-the teacher will necessarily be learning everything that he teaches, and the\nagent will be acted on. One may reply:\n(1) It is not absurd that the actualization of one thing should be in another. Teaching is the\nactivity of a person who can teach, yet the operation is performed on some patient-it is not cut\nadrift from a subject, but is of A on B.\n(2) There is nothing to prevent two things having one and the same actualization, provided the\nactualizations are not described in the same way, but are related as what can act to what is acting.\n\n(3) Nor is it necessary that the teacher should learn, even if to act and to be acted on are one and\nthe same, provided they are not the same in definition (as 'raiment' and 'dress'), but are the same\nmerely in the sense in which the road from Thebes to Athens and the road from Athens to Thebes\nare the same, as has been explained above. For it is not things which are in a way the same that\nhave all their attributes the same, but only such as have the same definition. But indeed it by no\nmeans follows from the fact that teaching is the same as learning, that to learn is the same as to\nteach, any more than it follows from the fact that there is one distance between two things which\nare at a distance from each other, that the two vectors AB and Ba, are one and the same. To\ngeneralize, teaching is not the same as learning, or agency as patiency, in the full sense, though\nthey belong to the same subject, the motion; for the 'actualization of X in Y' and the\n'actualization of Y through the action of X' differ in definition.\nWhat then Motion is, has been stated both generally and particularly. It is not difficult to see how\neach of its types will be defined-alteration is the fulfillment of the alterable qua alterable (or,\nmore scientifically, the fulfilment of what can act and what can be acted on, as such)-generally\nand again in each particular case, building, healing, &c. A similar definition will apply to each of\nthe other kinds of motion.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\nSTS.003 The Rise of Modern Science\nFall 2010\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

XVIII. Of the Schematisme or Texture of Cork, and of the Cells and\nPores of some other such frothy Bodies.\nI took a good clear piece of Cork, and with a Pen-knife sharpen'd as keen as a Razor, I cut a\npiece of it off, and thereby left the surface of it exceeding smooth, then examining it very\ndiligently with a Microscope, me thought I could perceive it to appear a little porous; but I could\nnot so plainly distinguish them, as to be sure that they were pores, much less what Figure they\nwere of: But judging from the lightness and yielding quality of the Cork, that certainly the\ntexture could not be so curious, but that possibly, if I could use some further diligence, I might\nfind it to be discernable with a Microscope, I with the same sharp Penknife, cut off from the\nformer smooth surface an exceeding thin piece of it, and placing it on a black object Plate,\nbecause it was it self a white body, and casting the light on it with a deep plano-convex Glass, I\ncould exceeding plainly perceive it to be all perforated and porous, much like a Honey-comb, but\nthat the pores of it were not regular; yet it was not unlike a Honey-comb in these particulars.\nFirst, in that it had a very little solid substance, in comparison of the empty cavity that was\ncontain'd between, as does more manifestly appear by the Figure A and B of the XI. Scheme, for\nthe Interstitia, or walls (as I may so call them) or partitions of those pores were neer as thin in\nproportion to their pores, as those thin films of Wax in a Honey-comb (which enclose and\nconstitute the sexangular celts) are to theirs.\nNext, in that these pores, or cells, were not very deep, but consisted of a great many little Boxes,\nseparated out of one continued long pore, by certain Diaphragms, as is visible by the Figure B,\nwhich represents a sight of those pores split the long-ways.\nI no sooner discern'd these (which were indeed the first microscopical pores I ever saw, and\nperhaps, that were ever seen, for I had not met with any Writer or Person, that had made any\nmention of them before this) but me thought I had with the discovery of them, presently hinted to\nme the true and intelligible reason of all the Phænomena of Cork; As,\nFirst, if I enquir'd why it was so exceeding light a body? my Microscope could presently inform\nme that here was the same reason evident that there is found for the lightness of froth, an empty\nHoney-comb, Wool, a Spunge, a Pumice-stone, or the like; namely, a very small quantity of a\nsolid body, extended into exceeding large dimensions.\nNext, it seem'd nothing more difficult to give an intelligible reason, why Cork is a body so very\nunapt to suck and drink in Water, and consequently preserves it self, floating on the top of Water,\nthough left on it never so long: and why it is able to stop and hold air in a Bottle, though it be\nthere very much condens'd and consequently presses very strongly to get a passage out, without\nsuffering the least bubble to pass through its substance. For, as to the first, since our Microscope\ninforms us that the substance of Cork is altogether fill'd with Air, and that that Air is perfectly\nenclosed in little Boxes or Cells distinct from one another. It seems very plain, why neither the\nWater, nor any other Air can easily insinuate it self into them, since there is already within them\n\nan intus existens, and consequently, why the pieces of Cork become so good floats for Nets, and\nstopples for Viols, or other close Vessels.\n\nAnd thirdly, if we enquire why Cork has such a springiness and swelling nature when\ncompress'd? and how it comes to suffer so great a compression, or seeming penetration of\ndimensions, so as to be made a substance as heavie again and more, bulk for bulk, as it was\nbefore compression, and yet suffer'd to return, is found to extend it self again into the same\nspace? Our Microscope will easily inform us, that the whole mass consists of an infinite\ncompany of small Boxes or Bladders of Air, which is a substance of a springy nature, and that\nwill suffer a considerable condensation (as I have several times found by divers trials, by which I\nhave most evidently condens'd it into less then a twentieth part of its usual dimensions neer the\nEarth, and that with no other strength then that of my hands without any kind of forcing Engine,\nsuch as Racks, Leavers, Wheels, Pullies, or the like, but this onely by and by) and besides, it\nseems very probable that those very films or sides of the pores, have in them a springing quality,\nas almost all other kind of Vegetable substances have, so as to help to restore themselves to their\nformer position.\nAnd could we so easily and certainly discover the Schematisme and Texture even of these films,\nand of several other bodies, as we can these of Cork; there seems no probable reason to the\ncontrary, but that we might as readily render the true reason of all their Phænomena; as namely,\nwhat were the cause of the springingess, and toughness of some, both as to their flexibility and\nrestitution. What, of the friability or brittleness of some others, and the like; but till such time as\nour Microscope, or some other means, enable us to discover the true Schematism and Texture of\nall kinds of bodies, we must grope, as it were, in the dark, and onely ghess at the true reasons of\nthings by similitudes and comparisons.\nBut, to return to our Observation. I told several lines of these pores, and found that there were\nusually about threescore of these small Cells placed end-ways in the eighteenth part of an Inch in\nlength, whence I concluded there must be neer eleven hundred of them, or somewhat more then a\nthousand in the length of an Inch, and therefore in a square Inch above a Million, or 1166400.\nand in a Cubick Inch, above twelve hundred Millions, or 1259712000. a thing almost incredible,\ndid not our Microscope assure us of it by ocular demonstration; nay, did it not discover to us the\npores of a body, which were they diaphragm'd, like those of Cork, would afford us in one\nCubick Inch, more then ten times as many little Cells, as is evident in several charr'd Vegetables;\nso prodigiously curious are the works of Nature, that even these conspicuous pores of bodies,\nwhich seem to be the channels or pipes through which the Succus nutritius, or natural juices of\nVegetables are convey'd, and seem to correspond to the veins, arteries and other Vessels in\nsensible creatures, that these pores I say, which seem to be the Vessels of nutrition to the vastest\nbody in the World, are yet so exceeding small, that the Atoms which Epicurus fancy'd would go\nneer to prove too bigg to enter them, much more to constitute a fluid body in them. And how\ninfinitely smaller then must be the Vessels of a Mite, or the pores of one of those little\nVegetables I have discovered to grow on the back-side of a Rose-leaf, and shall anon more fully\ndescribe, whose bulk is many millions of times less then the bulk of the small shrub it grows on;\nand even that shrub, many millions of times less in bulk then several trees (that have heretofore\ngrown in England, and are this day flourishing in other hotter Climates, as we are very credibly\ninform'd) if at least the pores of this small Vegetable should keep any such proportion to the\nbody of it, as we have found these pores of other Vegetables to do to their bulk. But of these\npores I have said more elsewhere.\n\nTo proceed then, Cork seems to be by the transverse constitution of the pores, a kind of Fungus\nor Mushrome, for the pores lie like so many Rays tending from the center, or pith of the tree,\noutwards; so that if you cut off a piece from a board of Cork transversly, to the flat of it, you\nwill, as it were, split the pores, and they will appear just as they are express'd in the Figure B of\nthe XI. Scheme. But if you shave off a very thin piece from this board, parallel to the plain of it,\nyou will cut all the pores transversly, and they will appear almost as they are express'd in the\nFigure A, save onely the solid Interstitia will not appear so thick as they are there represented.\nSo that Cork seems to suck its nourishment from the subjacent bark of the Tree immediately, and\nto be a kind of excrescence, or a substance distinct from the substances of the entire Tree,\nsomething analogus to the Mushrome, or Moss on other Trees, or to the hairs on Animals. And\nhaving enquir'd into the History of Cork, I find it reckoned as an excrescency of the bark of a\ncertain Tree, which is distinct from the two barks that lie within it, which are common also to\nother trees; That 'tis some time before the Cork that covers the young and tender sprouts comes\nto be discernable; That it cracks, flaws, and cleaves into many great chaps, the bark underneath\nremaining entire; That it may be separated and remov'd from the Tree, and yet the two under-\nbarks (such as are also common to that with other Trees) not at all injur'd, but rather helped and\nfreed from an external injury. Thus Jonstonus in Dendrologia, speaking de Subere, says, Arbor\nest procera, Lignum est robustum, dempto cortice in aquis non fluitat, Cortice in orbem detracto\njuvatur, crascescens enim præstringit & strangulat, intra triennium iterum repletur: Caudex ubi\nadolescit crassus, cortex superior densus carnosus, duos digitos crassus, scaber, rimosus, & qui\nnisi detrahatur dehiscit, alioque subnascente expellitur, interior qui subest novellus ita rubet ut\narbor minio picta videatur. Which Histories, if well consider'd, and the tree, substance, and\nmanner of growing, if well examin'd, would, I am very apt to believe, much confirm this my\nconjecture about the origination of Cork.\nNor is this kind of Texture peculiar to Cork onely; for upon examination with my Microscope, I\nhave found that the pith of an Elder, or almost any other Tree, the inner pulp or pith of the Cany\nhollow stalks of several other Vegetables: as of Fennel, Carrets, Daucus, Bur-docks, Teasels,\nFearn, some kinds of Reeds, &c. have much such a kind of Schematisme, as I have lately shewn\nthat of Cork, save onely that here the pores are rang'd the long-ways, or the same ways with the\nlength of the Cane, whereas in Cork they are transverse.\nThe pith also that fills that part of the stalk of a Feather that is above the Quil, has much such a\nkind of texture, save onely that which way soever I set this light substance, the pores seem'd to\nbe cut transversly; so that I ghess this pith which fills the Feather, not to consist of abundance of\nlong pores separated with Diaphragms, as Cork does, but to be a kind of solid or hardned froth,\nor a congeries of very small bubbles consolidated in that form, into a pretty stiff as well as tough\nconcrete, and that each Cavern, Bubble, or Cell, is distinctly separate from any of the rest,\nwithout any kind of hole in the encompassing films, so that I could no more blow through a piece\nof this kinde of substance, then I could through a piece of Cork, or the sound pith of an Elder.\nBut though I could not with my Microscope, nor with my breath, nor any other way I have yet\ntry'd, discover a passage out of one of those cavities into another, yet I cannot thence conclude,\nthat therefore there are none such, by which the Succus nutritius, or appropriate juices of\nVegetables, may pass through them; for, in several of those Vegetables, whil'st green, I have\n\nwith my Microscope, plainly enough discover'd these Cells or Poles fill'd with juices, and by\ndegrees sweating them out; as I have also observed in green Wood all those long Microscopical\npores which appear in Charcoal perfectly empty of any thing but Air.\nNow, though I have with great diligence endeavoured to find whether there be any such thing in\nthose Microscopical pores of Wood or Piths, as the Valves in the heart, veins, and other passages\nof Animals, that open and give passage to the contain'd fluid juices one way, and shut\nthemselves, and impede the passage of such liquors back again, yet have I not hitherto been able\nto say any thing positive in it; though, me thinks, it seems very probable, that Nature has in these\npassages, as well as in those of Animal bodies, very many appropriated Instruments and\ncontrivances, whereby to bring her designs and end to pass, which 'tis not improbable, but that\nsome diligent Observer, if help'd with better Microscopes, may in time detect.\nAnd that this may be so, seems with great probability to be argued from the strange Phænomena\nof sensitive Plants, wherein Nature seems to perform several Animal actions with the same\nSchematism or Orginization that is common to all Vegetables, as may appear by some no less\ninstructive then curious Observations that were made by divers Eminent Members of the Royal\nSociety on some of these kind of Plants, whereof an account was delivered in to them by the\nmost Ingenious and Excellent Physician, Doctor Clark, which, having that liberty granted me by\nthat most Illustrious Society, I have hereunto adjoyn'd.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\nSTS.003 The Rise of Modern Science\nFall 2010\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."
