  "syllabus_content": "Course Meeting Times\n\nLectures: 2 sessions / 4 weeks, 2 hours/ session\n\nLabs: 3 sessions / week, 2 hours / session\n\nPurpose of Course\n\nThis one-week Independent Activities Period (January) class will provide an introductory-level introduction to mammalian neuroanatomy. You will be taught through lectures (the introductory lecture focusing on structure, and the concluding lecture focusing on function), and through hands-on lab experience.\n\nThe course will consist of two lectures and three labs. The labs will include:\n\nsheep brain dissection\n\nhuman brain slice viewing\n\nneuroimaging anatomy\n\nStudents will be divided into groups and assigned to a lab section at the end of the first class.\n\nRequirements\n\nLab questions to guide the dissection\n\nClass attendance\n\nQuizzes\n\nYou will need not only to attend class and lab, but also to do a bit of homework.\n\nWe have provided you with a list of\nuseful web sites\n, and will also give you handouts to review.\n\nWe expect that you will have visited these web sites and read through the handouts before showing up at your section.\n\nThe questions for the lab are designed to be answered during the dissection of the sheep brain.",
