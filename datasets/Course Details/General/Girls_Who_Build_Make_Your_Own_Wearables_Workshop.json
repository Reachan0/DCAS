  "course_description": "The Girls Who Build: Make Your Own Wearables workshop for high school girls is an introduction to computer science, electrical and mechanical engineering through wearable technology. The workshop, developed by MIT Lincoln Laboratory, consists of two major hands-on projects in manufacturing and wearable electronics. These include 3D printing jewelry and laser cutting a purse, as well as programming LEDs to light up when walking. Participants learn the design process, 3D computer modeling, and machine shop tools, in addition to writing code and building a circuit.",

  "syllabus_content": "Workshop Meeting Time\n\nOne seven-hour session\n\nDescription\n\nWhat is the Make Your Own Wearables program?\n\nThe Lincoln Laboratory\nMake Your Own Wearables\nprogram is an introduction to engineering through wearable technology. The full day workshop developed and hosted by\nMIT Lincoln Laboratory\nconsists of two major hands-on projects in manufacturing and wearable electronics.\n\nIts mission is to introduce high-school girls to what engineering is, how it is used in many different applications, and to gain key engineering skills such as computer programming and computer aided design (CAD). This workshop aims to help girls entering college have a clear depiction of what an engineer does and have the hands-on skills required to be successful in this field.\n\nWhat will participants do?\n\nHigh-school girls will spend the day learning the design process, 3D computer modeling, how to write code, and how to build a circuit. Participants tour a rapid prototyping machine shop and see how 3D printed jewelry and laser-cut purses are created. They will design a bracelet using\nSolidWorks\n(r)\nand code a\nFLORA\nin Arduino for a wearable circuit with pressure sensor and LEDs.\n\nGrading\n\nThere are no grades for this workshop.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThe curriculum and workshop were made possible by the\nMIT Lincoln Laboratory's Community Outreach initiative\n,\nSolidWorks\n, and the\nSociety of Women Engineers\n.
