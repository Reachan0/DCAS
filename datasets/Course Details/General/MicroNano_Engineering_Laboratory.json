  "syllabus_content": "Course Meeting Times\n\nLectures: 1 session / week, 1 hour / session\n\nLabs: 1 session / week, 3 hours / session\n\nPrerequisites\n\n2.001 Mechanics & Materials I\n;\n3.091SC Introduction to Solid State Chemistry\nor\n5.111 Principles of Chemical Science\nor permission of the instructor.\n\nCorequisite\n\n2.005 Thermal-Fluids Engineering I\n\nCourse Highlights\n\nThis is a laboratory intensive course designed for undergraduates who want to study emerging topics in micro / nano technology. This course will encourage design thinking via lab modules of building, observing and manipulating micro- and nano-scale objects and structures. Students will learn about underlying science and engineering principles and possible applications through hands-on lab modules. Throughout the semester, students will go through 11 lab modules in three streams of micro / nano engineering (MEMS, microfluidics, and nanomaterials). This is a 6-unit subject with one lecture (1 hour) and one lab session (3 hours) per week.\n\nLectures\n\nOne-hour lecture per week provides background material pertinent to the accompanying lab modules. Combining alternating lecture and laboratory segments, students will have the opportunity to continually take concepts introduced in lecture to the laboratory bench top.\n\nLab Modules\n\nThere are eleven labs roughly falling into five categories.\n\nFun with molding (Labs 1 and 2)\n\nMicrofluidic hydrodynamics (Labs 3, 4 and 5)\n\nSelf-assembly and surface Engineering (Lab 6)\n\nGrowing, building and observing micro and nanostructures (Labs 7, 8 and 9)\n\nScanning nanosurfaces with AFM cantilevers (Labs 10 and 11)\n\nThe lab modules will have students\ntouch, see, build\nmicro-and nano-scale objects and\nthink\nabout their design implications and the underlying science through lab sessions. For each lab module,\na comprehensive reader containing background material\n, laboratory protocols and lab write-up questions will be distributed in lecture. Suggested background reading material is very useful for the completion of the lab write-up material.\n\nLab Reports\n\nEach lab module requires a lab report, in which the students complete the lab write-up questions within the module reader, due at the beginning of the laboratory session for the subsequent lab module. Late submission of reports / assignments will lead to a 10% decrease in points per day.\n\nIn the Laboratory\n\nStudents are highly encouraged to maintain a separate lab notebook for recording any observations, results, or comments while performing the experiments. You will also find it helpful to carry a USB drive to download data, or a camera to record images. To ensure that there are no injuries or accidents,\nlab safety training is mandatory\n. Lab attire includes close-toed shoes; no shorts or loose clothing / hair. Follow common sense in the lab-running around, jumping, etc. can be potentially dangerous!\n\nGrading Policy\n\nClass participation in highly encouraged, and will be reflected in your final grade.\n\nCommunication with the instructors and staff helps us get to know you, and is a valuable skill for working through problems and maximizing your laboratory experience.\n\nACTIVITIES\n\nPOINTS\n\n11 lab reports\n\n20 points each, 220 points total\n\nClass / Lab participation\n\n30 points\n\nQuiz (a short one at the end of the semester)\n\n50 points\n\nTotal\n\n300 points",

What is MEMS and comparison with microelectronics\nMicro Electro Mechanical Systems or MEMS is a term coined around 1989 by Prof.\nR. Howe [1] and others to describe an emerging research field, where mechanical\nelements, like cantilevers or membranes, had been manufactured at a scale more akin to\nmicroelectronic circuit than to lathe machining. But MEMS is not the only term used to\ndescribe this field and from its multicultural origin it is also known as Micromachines, a\nterm often used in Japan, or as Microsystem Technology (MST), in Europe.\nHowever, if the etymology of the word is more or less well known, the dictionaries are\nstill mum about an exact definition. Actually, what could link an inkjet printer head, a\nvideo projector DLP system, a disposable bio-analysis chip and an airbag crash sensor -\nyes, they are all MEMS, but what is MEMS?\nIt appears that these devices share the presence of features below 100 μm that are not\nmachined using standard machining but using other techniques globally called micro-\nfabrication technology. Of course, this simple definition would also include\nmicroelectronics, but there is a characteristic that electronic circuits do not share with\nMEMS. While electronic circuits are inherently solid and compact structures, MEMS\nhave holes, cavity, channels, cantilevers, membranes, etc, and, in some way, resemble\n'mechanical' parts.\nThis has a direct impact on their manufacturing process. Actually, even when MEMS are\nbased on silicon, microelectronics process needs to be adapted to cater for thicker layer\ndeposition, deeper etching and to introduce special steps to free the mechanical structures.\nThen, many more MEMS are not based on silicon and can be manufactured in polymer, in\nglass, in quartz or even in metal...\nThus, if similarities between MEMS and microelectronics exist, they now clearly are two\ndistinct fields. Actually, MEMS needs a completely different set of mind, where next to\nelectronics, mechanical and material knowledge plays a fundamental role.\n1.2. Why MEMS technology\n1.2.1. Advantages offered\nThe development of a MEMS component has a cost that should not be misevaluated but\nthe technology has the possibility to bring unique benefits. The reasons that prompt the\nuse of MEMS technology can be classified broadly in three classes:\n- miniaturization of existing devices, like for example the production of silicon based\ngyroscope which reduced existing devices weighting several kg and with a volume of\n1000cm3 to a chip of a few grams contained in a 0.5cm3 package.\n- development of new devices based on principles that do not work at larger scale. A\ntypical example is given by the biochips where electrical field are use to pump the\nreactant around the chip. This so called electro-osmotic effect based on the existence of a\ndrag force in the fluid works only in channels with dimension of a fraction of one mm,\nthat is, at micro-scale.\n- development of new tools to interact with the micro-world. In 1986 H. Rohrer and G.\nBinnig at IBM were awarded the Nobel price in physics for their work on scanning\ntunneling microscope. This work heralded the development of a new class of microscopes\n(atomic force microscope, scanning near-field optical microscope...) that shares the\npresence of micromachined sharp micro-tips with radius below 50nm. This micro-tool\nwas used to position atoms in complex arrangement, writing Chinese character or helping\n\nverify some prediction of quantum mechanics. Another example of this class of MEMS\ndevices at a slightly larger scale would be the development of micro-grippers to handle\ncells for analysis.\nBy far miniaturization is often the most important driver behind MEMS development. The\ncommon perception is that miniaturization reduces cost, by decreasing material\nconsumption and allowing batch fabrication, but an important collateral benefit is also in\nthe increase of applicability. Actually, reduced mass and size allow placing the MEMS in\nplaces where a traditional system won't have been able to fit. Finally, these two effects\nconcur to increase the total market of the miniaturized device compared to its costlier and\nbulkier ancestor. A typical example is brought by the accelerometer developed as a\nreplacement for traditional airbag triggering sensor and that is now used in many\nappliances, as in digital cameras to help stabilize the image or even in the contact-less\ngame controller integrated with the latest handphones.\nHowever often miniaturization alone cannot justify the development of new MEMS. After\nall if the bulky component is small enough, reliable enough, and particularly cheap then\nthere is probably no reason to miniaturize it. Micro-fabrication process cost cannot usually\ncompete with metal sheet punching or other conventional mass production methods.\nBut MEMS technology allows something different, at the same time you make the\ncomponent smaller you can make it better. The airbag crash sensor gives us a good\nexample of the added value that can be brought by developing a MEMS device. Some\nnon-MEMS crash sensors are based on a metal ball retained by a rolling spring or a\nmagnetic field. The ball moves in response to a rapid car deceleration and shorts two\ncontacts inside the sensor. A simple and cheap method, but the ball can be blocked or\ncontact may have been contaminated and when your start your engine, there is no easy\nway to tell if the sensor will work or not. MEMS devices can have a built-in self-test\nfeature, where a micro-actuator will simulate the effect of deceleration and allow checking\nthe integrity of the system every time you startup the engine.\nAnother advantage that MEMS can bring relates with the system integration. Instead of\nhaving a series of external components (sensor, inductor...) connected by wire or soldered\nto a printed circuit board, the MEMS on silicon can be integrated directly with the\nelectronics. Whether it is on the same chip or in the same package it results in increased\nreliability and decreased assembly cost, opening new application opportunities.\nAs we see, MEMS technology not only makes the things smaller but often makes them\nbetter.\n1.2.2. Diverse products and markets\nThe previous difficulty we had to define MEMS stems from the vast number of products\nthat fall under the MEMS umbrella. The MEMS component currently on the market can\nbe broadly divided in six categories (Table 1.1), where next to the well-known pressure\nand inertia sensors produced by different manufacturer like Motorola, Analog Devices,\nSensonor or Delphi we have many other products. The micro-fluidic application are best\nknown for the inkjet printer head popularized by Hewlett Packard, but they also include\nthe burgeoning bioMEMS market with micro analysis system like the capillary\nelectrophoresis system from Agilent or the DNA chips.\nOptical MEMS includes the component for the fiber optic telecommunication like the\nswitch based on a moving mirror produced by Sercalo. They also include the optical\nswitch matrix that is now waiting for the recovery of the telecommunication industry.\n\nThis component consists of 100s of micro-mirror that can redirect the light from one input\nfiber to one output fiber, when the fibers are arranged either along a line (proposed by the\nnow defunct Optical Micro Machines) or in a 2D configuration (Lambda router from\nLucent). Moreover MOEMS deals with the now rather successful optical projection\nsystem that is competing with the LCD projector. The MEMS products are based either on\nan array of torsional micro-mirror in the Texas Instrument Digital Light Processor (DLP)\nsystem or on an array of controllable grating as in the Grating Light Valve (GLV) from\nSilicon Light Machines.\nRF MEMS is also emerging as viable MEMS market. Next to passive components like\nhigh-Q inductors produced on the IC surface to replace the hybridized component as\nproposed by MEMSCAP we find RF switches and soon micromechanical filters.\nBut the list does not end here and we can find micromachined relays (MMR) produced for\nexample by Omron, HDD read/write head and actuator or even toys, like the autonomous\nmicro-robot EMRoS produced by EPSON.\nProduct category\nPressure sensor\nInertia sensor\nMicrofluidics /\nbioMEMS\nOptical MEMS /\nMOEMS\nRF MEMS\nOthers\nExample\nManifold pressure (MAP), tire pressure, blood pressure...\nAccelerometer, gyroscope, crash sensor...\nInkjet printer nozzle, micro-bio-analysis systems,\nDNA chips...\nMicro-mirror array for projection (DLP), micro-grating array for\nprojection (GLV), optical fiber switch, adaptive optics...\nHigh Q-inductor, switches, antenna, filter...\nRelays, microphone, data storage, toys...\nTable 1.1: MEMS products example\nIn 2002 these products represented a market of about 3.2B$, with roughly one third in\ninkjet printer nozzle, one third in pressure sensor and the rest split between inertia sensors,\nRF MEMS, optical MEMS, projection display chip and bioMEMS [2]. Of course the\nMEMS market overall value is still small compared to the 180B$ IC industry - but there\nare two aspects that still make it very interesting:\n- it is expected to grow at an annual rate of 18% for the foreseeable future, much\nhigher than any projection for IC industry;\n- MEMS chips have a large leveraging effect, and in the average a MEMS based\nsystems will have 8 times more value than the MEMS chip price (e.g., a DLP\nprojector is about 10 times the price of a MEMS DLP chip).\nThis last point has created very large difference between market studies, whether they\nreported market for components alone or for systems. The number cited above are in the\naverage of other studies and represent the market for the MEMS components alone.\n1.2.3. Economy of MEMS manufacturing and applications\nHowever large the number of opportunities is, it should not make companies believe that\nthey can invest in any of these fields randomly. For example, although the RF MEMS\nmarket seems to be growing fuelled for the appetite for smaller wireless communication\ndevices, it seems to grow mostly through internal growth. Actually the IC foundries are\n\ndeveloping their own technology for producing, for example, high-Q inductors, and it\nseems that an external provider will have a very limited chance to penetrate the market.\nThus, market opportunities should be analyzed in detail to eliminate the false perception\nof a large market, taking into consideration the targeted customer inertia to change and the\npossibility that the targeted customer himself develop MEMS based solution. In that\naspect, sensors seems an easy target being simple enough to allow full development\nwithin small business unit and having a large base of customers - however, an optical\nswitch matrix is riskier because its value is null without the system that is built by a\nlimited number of customers, which most probably have the capabilities to develop in\nhouse the MEMS component anyway.\nSome MEMS products already achieve high volume and benefit greatly from the batch\nfabrication technique. For example more than 100 millions MEMS accelerometers are\nsold every year in the world - and with newer use coming, this number is still growing\nfast. But large numbers in an open market invariably means also fierce competition and\nultimately reduced prices. Long are gone the days where a MEMS accelerometer could be\nsold 10$ a piece - it is now less than 2$ and still dropping. Currently, the next target is a\n3-axis accelerometer in a single package for about 4$, so that it can really enter the toys\nindustry. Note that there may be a few exceptions to this rule. Actually, if the number of\nunit sold is also very large, the situation with the inkjet printer nozzle is very different.\nCanon and Hewlett Packard developed a completely new product, the inkjet printer,\nwhich was better than earlier dot matrix printer, creating a captive market for its MEMS\nbased system. This has allowed HP to repeatedly top the list of MEMS manufacturer with\nsales in excess of 600M$. This enviable success is unfortunately most probably difficult\nto emulate.\nBut these cases should not hide the fact that MEMS markets are essentially niche markets.\nFew product will reach the million unit/year mark and currently among the more than 300\ncompanies producing MEMS only a dozen have sales above 100m$/year. Thus great care\nshould be taken in balancing the research and development effort, because the difficulty\nof developing new MEMS from scratch can be daunting and the return low. For example,\nalthough Texas Instrument is now reaping the fruit of its Digital Light Processor selling\nbetween 1996 and 2004 more than 4 millions chips for a value now approaching\n200m$/year, the development of the technology by L. Hornbeck took more than 10 years\n[3]. Few startup companies will ever have this opportunity.\nActually it is not clear for a company what the best approach for entering the MEMS\nbusiness is, and we observe a large variety of business model with no clear winner. For\nmany years in microelectronics industry the abundance of independent foundries and\npackaging companies has made fabless approach a viable business model. However it is\nan approach only favored by a handful of MEMS companies, and it seems for good\nreasons.\nA good insight in the polymorphism of MEMS business can be gained by studying the\ncompany MemsTech, now a holding listed on the Kuala Lumpur Mesdaq (Malaysia) and\nhaving office in Detroit, Kuala Lumpur and Singapore.\nSingapore is actually where everything started in the mid-90's for MemsTech with the\ndesire from an international company (EG&G) to enter the MEMS sensor market. They\nfound a suitable partner in Singapore at the Institute of Microelectronics (IME), a research\ninstitute with vast experience in IC technology.\nThis type of cooperation has been a frequent business model for MNC willing to enter\nMEMS market, by starting with ex-house R&D contract development of a component.\n\nEG&G and IME designed an accelerometer, patenting along the way new fabrication\nprocess and developing a cheap plastic packaging process. Finally the R&D went well\nenough and the complete clean room used for the development was spun-off and used for\nthe production of the accelerometer.\nHere, we have another typical startup model, where IP developed in research institute and\nuniversity ends up building a company. This approach is very typical of MEMS\ndevelopment, with a majority of the existing MEMS companies having been spun-off\nfrom a public research institute or a university.\nA few years down the road the fab continuously produced accelerometer and changed\nhands to another MNC before being bought back in 2001 by its management. During that\nperiod MemsTech was nothing else but a component manufacturer providing off-the-shelf\naccelerometer, just like what Motorola, Texas Instrument and others are doing.\nBut after the buyout, MemsTech needed to diversify its business and started proposing\nfabrication services. It then split in two entities: the fab, now called Sensfab, and the\npackaging and testing unit, Senzpak. Three years later, the company had increased its\n'off-the-shelf' product offering, proposing accelerometer, pressure sensor, microphones\nand one IR camera developed in cooperation with local and overseas university.\nThis is again a typical behaviour of small MEMS companies where growth is fuelled by\ncooperation with external research institutions. Still at the same time MemsTech proposes\nwafer fabrication, packaging and testing services to external companies. This model\nwhere products and services are mixed is another typical MEMS business model, also\nfollowed by Silicon Microstructures in the USA, Colybris in Switzerland, MEMSCAP in\nFrance and some other. Finally, in June 2004 MemsTech went public on the Mesdaq\nmarket in Kuala Lumpur.\nThe main reason why the company could survives its entire series of avatar, is most\nprobably because it had never overgrown its market and had the wisdom to remain a small\ncompany, with staff around 100 persons. Now, with a good product portfolio and a solid\nbase of investor it is probably time for expansion.\n1.3. Major drivers for MEMS technology\nFrom the heyday of MEMS research at the end of the 1960s, started by the discovery of\nsilicon large piezoresisitive effect by C. Smith [4] and the demonstration of anisotropic\netching of silicon by J. Price [5] that paved the way to the first pressure sensor, one main\ndriver for MEMS development has been the automotive industry. It is really amazing to\nsee how many MEMS sensor a modern car can use! From the first oil pressure sensors,\ncar manufacturer quickly added manifold and tire pressure sensors, then crash sensors,\none, then two and now up to five accelerometers. Recently the gyroscopes made their\napparition for anti-skidding system and also for navigation unit - the list seems without\nend.\nMiniaturized pressure sensors were also quick to find their ways in medical equipment for\nblood pressure test. Since then biomedical application have drained a lot of attention from\nMEMS developer, and DNA chip or micro-analysis system are the latest successes in the\nlist. Because you usually sell medical equipment to doctors and not to patients, the\nbiomedical market has many features making it perfect for MEMS: a niche market with\nlarge added value.\nActually cheap and small MEMS sensors have many applications. Digital cameras have\nbeen starting using accelerometer to stabilize image, or to automatically find image\norientation. Accelerometers are also being used in new contactless game controller or\nmouse.\n\nThese two later products are just a small part of the MEMS-based system that the\ncomputer industry is using to interface the arid beauty of digits with our human senses.\nThe inkjet printer, DLP based projector, head-up display with MEMS scanner are all\nMEMS based computer output interfaces. Additionally, computer mass storage uses a\ncopious amount of MEMS, for example, the hard-disk drive nowadays based on\nmicromachined GMR head and dual stage MEMS micro-actuator. Of course in that last\nfield more innovations are in the labs, and most of them use MEMS as the central\nreading/writing element.\nThe telecommunication industry has fuelled the biggest MEMS R&D effort so far, when\nat the turn of the millennium, 10s of companies started developing optical MEMS switch\nand similar components. We all know too well that the astounding 2D-switch matrix\ndeveloped by Optical Micro Machines (OMM) and the 3D-matrix developed in just over\n18 months at Lucent are now bed tale stories. However within a few years they placed\noptical MEMS as a serious contender for the future extension of the optical network,\nwaiting for the next market rebound. Wireless telecommunications are also using more\nand more MEMS components. MEMS are slowly sipping into handphone replacing\ndiscrete elements one by one, RF switch, microphone, filters - until the dream of a 1mm3\nhandphone becomes true (with vocal recognition for numbering of course!). The latest\ncraze seems to be in using accelerometers (again) inside handphone to convert them into\ngame controller, the ubiquitous handphone becoming even more versatile.\nLarge displays are another consumer product that may prove to become a large market for\nMEMS. Actually, if plasma and LCD TV seems to become more and more accepted, their\nprice is still very high and recently vendors start offering large display based on MEMS\nprojector at about half the price of their flat panel cousin. Projector based system can be\nvery small and yet provide large size image. Actually, for the crown of the largest size the\nDLP projecting system from TI is a clear winner as evidenced by the digital cinema\ntheaters that are burgeoning all over the globe. For home theater the jury is still debating -\nbut MEMS will probably get a good share at it and DLP projector and similar\ntechnologies won't be limited to PowerPoint presentation.\nFinally, it is in the space that MEMS are finding an ultimate challenge and already some\nMEMS sensors have been used in satellite. The development of micro (less than 100kg)\nand nano (about 10kg) satellites is bringing the mass and volume advantage of MEMS to\ngood use and some project are considering swarms of nanosatellite each replete with\nmicromachined systems.\n1.4. Mutual benefits between MEMS and microelectronics\nThe synergies between MEMS development and microelectronics are many. Actually\nMEMS clearly has its roots in microelectronics, as H. Nathanson at Westinghouse\nreported in 1967 the \"resonant gate transistor\" [6], which is now considered to be the first\nMEMS. This device used the resonant properties of a cantilevered beam acting as the gate\nof a field-effect transistor to provide electronic filtering with high-Q. But even long after\nthis pioneering work, the emphasis on MEMS based on silicon was clearly a result of the\nvast knowledge on silicon material and on silicon based microfabrication gained by\ndecades of research in microelectronics. Even quite recently the SOI technology\ndeveloped for ICs has found a new life with MEMS.\nBut the benefit is not unilateral and the MEMS technology has indirectly paid back this\nhelp by nurturing new electronic product. MEMS brought muscle and sight to the\nelectronic brain, enabling a brand new class of embedded system that could sense, think\nand act while remaining small enough to be placed everywhere.\n\nAs a more direct benefit, MEMS can also help keep older microelectronics fab running.\nActually MEMS devices most of the times have minimum features size of a several μm,\nallowing the use of older generation IC fabrication equipment that otherwise will have just\nbeen dumped. It is even possible to convert a complete plant and Analog Devices has\nredeveloped an older BiCMOS fabrication unit to successfully produce their renowned\nsmart MEMS accelerometer. Moreover, as we have seen, MEMS component often have\nsmall market and although batch fabrication is a must, a large part of the MEMS\nproduction is still done using 4\" (100 mm) and 6\" (150 mm) wafers - and could use 5-6\nyears old IC production equipment.\nBut this does not mean that equipment manufacturer cannot benefit from MEMS. Actually\nMEMS fabrication has specific needs (deeper etch, double side alignment, wafer bonding,\nthicker layer...) with a market large enough to support new product line. For example,\nfirms like STS and Alcatel-Adixen producing MEMS deep RIE or EVGroup and Suss for\ntheir wafer bonder and double side mask aligner have clearly understood how to adapt\ntheir know-how to the MEMS fabrication market.\n\n2. Fundamentals of MEMS design and technology\n2.1. Physical scaling laws\nThe large decrease in size during miniaturization, that in some case can reach 1 or 2\norders of magnitude, has a tremendous impact on the behavior of micro-object when\ncompared to their larger size cousin. We are already aware of some of the most visible\nimplications of miniaturization. Actually nobody will be surprised to see a crumb stick to\nthe rubbed surface of a plastic rod, whereas the whole bread loaf is not. Everybody will\ntell that it works with the crumb and not with the whole loaf because the crumb is lighter.\nActually it is a bit more complicated than that.\nThe force that is attracting the crumb is the electrostatic force, which is proportional to the\namount of charge on the surface of the crumb, which in turn is proportional to its surface.\nThus when we shrink the size and go from the loaf to the crumb, we not only decrease the\nvolume and thus the mass but we also decrease the surface and thus the electrostatic force.\nHowever, because the surface varies as the square of the dimension and the volume as the\ncube, this decrease in the force is relatively much smaller than the drop experienced by\nthe mass. Thus finally not only the crumb mass is smaller, but, what is more important, ,\nthe force acting on it becomes proportionally larger - making the crumb really fly!\nFigure 2.1: Scaling effect on volume, surface and volume/surface ratio.\nTo get a better understanding, we can refer to Figure 2.1 and consider a cube whose side\ngoes from a length of 10 to a length of 1. The surface of the bigger cube is 6×10×10 = 600\nwhereas its volume is 10×10×10=1000. But now what happen to the scaled down cube?\nIts surface is 6×1×1=6 and has been divided by 100 but its volume is 1×1×1 =1 and has\nbeen divided by 1000. Thus the volume/surface ratio has also shrunk by a factor of 10,\nmaking the surface effect proportionally 10 times larger with the smaller cube than with\nthe bigger one.\nThis decrease of volume/surface ratio has profound implications for the design of MEMS.\nActually it means that at a certain level of miniaturization, the surface effect will start to\nbe dominant over the volume effects. For example, friction force (proportional to surface)\nwill become larger than inertia (proportional to mass hence to volume), heat dissipation\nwill become quicker and heat storage reduced: energy storage will become less attractive\nthan energy coupling... This last example is well illustrated by one of the few ever built\nmicromachines, the EMRoS micro-robot from Epson. The EMRoS (Epson Micro Robot\nSystem) is not powered with a battery (which stores energy proportional to its volume and\nbecomes less interesting at small scale) but with solar cells whose output is clearly\nproportional to surface.\nThen of course we can dwell into a more elaborate analysis of nature laws and try to see\napart from geometrical factor what happens when we shrink the scale? Following an\nanalysis pioneered by W. Trimmer [7], we may describe the way physical quantities vary\n\nwith scale as a power of an arbitrary scale variable, s. We have just seen that volume scale\nas s3, surface as s2 and the volume/surface ratio as s1. In the same vein we may have a\nlook at different forces and see how they scale down (Table 2.1).\nForce Scaling\nlaw\nSurface tension\ns1\nElectrostatic, Pressure, Muscle\ns2\nMagnetic\ns3\nGravitational\ns4\nTable 2.1: Scaling of nature forces.\nFrom this table it appears that some forces that are insignificant at large scale becomes\npredominant at smaller scale. For example we see that gravity, which scales as s4 (that is\ndecrease by a factor 10,000 when the scale is shrunk by 10) is relatively weak at micro-\nscale. However a more favorable force will be the tension force, which decrease as s1\nmaking it an important (and often annoying for non-fluidic application) force at micro-\nscale. The table also reveals that the electrostatic force will become more interesting than\nthe magnetic force as the scale goes down. Of course this simple description is more\nqualitative than quantitative. Actually if we know that as the size shrinks the electrostatic\nforce will finally exceed the magnetic force, a more detailed analysis is needed to find if it\nis at a size of 100μm, 1μm or 10nm. In that particular case it has been shown that the\nprediction becomes true when the dimensions reach a few μm, right in the scale of MEMS\ndevices. This has actually been the driver behind the design of the first electrostatic\nmotors by R. Howe and R. Muller [8].\nA more surprising consequence of miniaturization is that, contrary to what we would\nthink at first, the relative manufacturing accuracy is sharply decreasing. This was first\nformalized by M. Madou [9] and it is indeed interesting to see that the relative accuracy of\na MEMS device is at a few % not much better than standard masonry. Actually, if it is\ntrue that the absolute accuracy of MEMS patterning can reach 1μm, the MEMS size is in\nthe 10μm-100μm, meaning a relative patterning accuracy of 1%-10% or even less. We are\nhere very far from single point diamond turning or the manufacturing of large telescope\nmirror that can both reach a relative accuracy of 0.0001%.\nSo, ok, we have a low relative accuracy, but what does that mean in practice? Let's take\nas an example the stiffness of a cantilever beam. From solid mechanics the stiffness, k,\ndepends on the beam cross-section shape and is proportional to,\nw\nk ∝ Eh\nL\nwhere E is the elasticity modulus, h is the beam thickness, w its width and L its length. As\nwe can see here if the beam width accuracy is ±10%, then the stiffness, varying as a\npower of 3, will have an accuracy of ±30%. For a stiffness nominal value of 1N/m, it\nmeans that the expected value can be between 0.7N/m and 1.3N/m - this is almost a\nvariation by a factor of two! Our design needs to be tolerant to such variation, or the yield\nwill be very low. In this particular case, one approach to alleviate this problem would be\nto improve the relative accuracy, for example, by increasing the nominal width of the\nbeam to 4μm - of course it also means doubling its length if one wants to keep the same\nspring constant.\n\n2.2. The principles of design and reliability\nSince the first days of pressure sensor development, MEMS designers have had to face the\ncomplexity of designing MEMS. Actually if IC design relies on an almost complete\nseparation between fabrication process, circuit layout design and packaging, the most\nsuccessful MEMS have been obtained by developing these three aspects simultaneously.\nFigure 2.2: IC and MEMS design paradigms.\nActually MEMS fabrication process is so much intertwined with the device operation that\nMEMS design often involve a good deal of process development. If it is true that some\nstandard processes are proposed by a few foundries (e.g, SOI process, and 3 layer surface\nmicromachining by MEMSCap, epitaxy with buried interconnect by Bosch...), there is in\nMEMS nothing as ubiquitous as the CMOS process.\nThe success of the device often depends on physics, material property and the choice of\nfabrication techniques. Actually some industry observers are even claiming that in MEMS\nthe rule is \"One Product, One Process\" - and many ways to achieve the same goal.\nActually we are aware of at least five completely different processes that are used to\nfabricate commercial MEMS accelerometer and sell them at about the same price - and\nfor at least two companies the accelerometer is their only MEMS product.\nAnd what about packaging then, the traditional back-end process? In MEMS it can\naccount for more than 50% of the final product price and obviously should not be ignored.\nActually the designer has to consider the packaging aspect too, and there are horror stories\nmurmured in the industry where products had to be completely redeveloped after trials for\npackaging went unsuccessful. The main issues solved by MEMS packaging are less\nrelated with heat dissipation than with stress, hermetic sealing and often chip alignment\nand positioning. If chip orientation for IC is usually not a concern, it becomes one for\nsingle-axis MEMS accelerometer where the chip has to be aligned precisely with respect\nto the package. This may imply the use of alignment mark, on the MEMS and in the\npackage. In other case the chip may need to be aligned with external access port. Actually\nMEMS sensors often need an access hole in the package to bring air or a liquid in contact\nwith the sensing chip, complicating substantially the packaging. One of the innovative\napproaches to this problem has been to use a first level packaging during the fabrication\nprocess to shield the sensitive parts, finally linking the back-end with the front-end. Even\nfor MEMS that do not need access to the environment, packaging can be a complex issue\nbecause of stress. MEMS often use stress sensitive structure to measure the deformation\nof a member and the additional stress introduced during packaging could affect this\nfunction. Motorola solved this problem with its line of pressure sensor by providing\ncalibration of the device after packaging - then any packaging induced drift will be\nautomatically zeroed.\nThis kind of solution highlights the need to practice design for testing. In the case of\nMotorola this resulted in adding a few more pins in the package linked to test point to\n\nindependently tweak variable gain amplifier. This cannot be an afterthought, but need to\nbe taken into consideration early. How will you test your device? At wafer level, chip\nlevel or after packaging? MEMS require here again much different answers than ICs.\nUnderstandably it will be difficult to find all the competence needed to understand these\nproblems in one single designer, and good MEMS design will be teamwork with\nbrainstorming sessions, trying to find the best overall solution. MEMS design cannot\nsimply resume to a sequence of optimized answer for each of the individual process,\ndevice and packaging tasks - success will only come from a global answer to the\ncomplete system problem.\nAn early misconception about MEMS accelerometer was that these small parts with\nsuspension that were only a few μm wide would be incredibly fragile and break with the\nfirst shock. Of course it wasn't the case, first because silicon is a wonderful mechanical\nmaterial tougher than steel and then because the shrinking dimension implied a really\ninsignificant mass, and thus very little inertia forces. But sometime people can be\nstubborn and seldom really understand the predictive nature of the law of physics,\npreferring to trust their (too) common sense. Analog Device was facing the hard task to\nconvince the army that their MEMS based accelerometer could be used in military system,\nbut it quickly appeared that it had to be a more direct proof than some equations on a\nwhite board. They decided to equip a mortar shell with an accelerometer and a telemetry\nsystem, and then they fired the shell. The accelerometer was quickly measuring a varying\nacceleration that was later traced back to the natural spin of the shell during flight. And\nthen the shell hit his target and exploded. Of course the telemetry system went mum and\nthe sensor was destroyed. However, the 'fragile' sensing part was still found in the\ndebris... and it wasn't broken.\nIn another example, the DLP chip from Texas Instrument has mirrors supported by torsion\nhinge 1 μm wide and 60 nm thick that clearly seems very prone to failure. TI engineers\nknew it wasn't a problem because at this size the slippage between material grains\noccurring during cyclic deformation is quickly relieved on the hinge surface, and never\nbuild-up, avoiding catastrophic failure. But, again, they had to prove their design right in a\nmore direct way. TI submitted the mirrors of many chips through 3 trillion (1012) cycles,\nfar more that what is expected from normal operation... and again not one single of the\n100 millions tested hinges failed.\nOf course some design will be intrinsically more reliable than other and following a\ntaxonomy introduced by P. McWhorter, at Sandia National Laboratory [10], MEMS can\nbe divided in four classes, with potentially increasing reliability problems.\nClass\nI\nII\nIII\nIV\nType\nNo moving part\nMoving part, no\nrubbing and\nimpacting part\nMoving part,\nimpacting\nsurfaces\nMoving part,\nimpacting and\nrubbing surfaces\nExample\nAccelerometer,\nPressure sensor,\nHigh-Q inductor,\nInkjet nozzle...\nGyroscopes,\nResonator, Filter\nTI DLP,\nRelay, Valve,\nPump\nOptical switch,\nscanner, locking\nsystem\nTable 2.2: Taxonomy for evaluating MEMS devices reliability\nBy looking at this table it becomes clearer why developing the Texas Instrument DLP\ntook many more years than developing accelerometer - the reliability of the final device\nwas an issue and for example, mirrors had originally a tendency to stick to the substrate\n\nduring operation. TI had to go through a series of major improvements in the material and\nin the design to increase the reliability of their first design.\n2.3. MEMS design tools\nAs we have seen miniaturization science is not always intuitive. What may be true at large\nscale may become wrong at smaller scale. This translates into an immediate difficulty to\ndesign new MEMS structure following some guts feeling. Our intuition may be\ncompletely wrong and will need to be backed up by accurate modeling. However\nsimulation of MEMS can become incredibly complex and S. Senturia describes a multi-\ntiered approach that is more manageable [11].\nFigure 2.3: MEMS multi-tiered simulation.\nSome simulation tools like Intellisuite by Intellisense or Coventorware by Coventor have\nbeen specifically devised for MEMS. They allow accurate modeling using meshing\nmethod (FEM, BEM) to solve the partial different equation that describe a device in\ndifferent physical domains. Moreover, they try to give a complete view of the MEMS\ndesign, which, as we said before, is material and process dependent, and thus they give\naccess to material and process libraries. In this way it is possible to build quickly 3D\nmodel of MEMS from the mask layout using simulated process. However MEMS process\nsimulation is still in its infancy and the process simulator is used as a simple tool to build\nquickly the simulation model from purely geometrical consideration, but cannot yet be\nused to optimize the fabrication process. One exception will be the simulation of\nanisotropic etching of silicon and some processes modeled for IC development (oxidation,\nresist development...) where the existing TCAD tools (SUPREM, etc) can be used.\nComplete MEMS devices are generally too complex to be modeled entirely ab initio, and\ngenerally reduced models have to be used. For example, behavioral simulation is used by\nMEMSPro from MemsCap where ANSYS is used to generate the reduced model, which\nthen is run in circuit-analysis software like Spice. Sugar from C. Pister's group at UC\nBerkeley is also based on lumped analysis of behavioral model, but the decomposition of\nthe structure in simpler element is left to the designer. Still, although the actual tendency\nis to use numerical modeling extensively, it is our opinion that no good device modeling\ncan be devised without a first analytic model based on algebraic equation. Developing a\nreduced order model based on some analytic expression help our intuition regains some of\nits power. For example, seeing that the stiffness varies as the beam width to the cube\nmakes it clearer how we should shrink this beam: if the width is divided by a bit more\nthan two, the stiffness is already ten times smaller. This kind of insight is invaluable. The\n\nanalytic model devised need of course to be verified with a few examples using numerical\nsimulation.\nFinally the system level simulation is often not in the hand of the MEMS designer, but\nhere block diagram and lumped model can be used, with only a limited set of key state\nvariable. This model may then include the electronics and the MEMS device will be\nrepresented by one or more blocks, reusing the equation derived for the behavioral model.\n2.4. MEMS system partitioning\nAt the early stage of MEMS design an important question to be answered will be: hybrid\nor monolithic? Actually the decision to integrate the MEMS with its electronics or to\nbuild two separate chips has a tremendous impact on the complete design process. Most\nMEMS observer will advocate the use of separate chips and only in the case of a definite\nadvantage (performance, size, cost) should a MEMS be integrated together with its\nelectronics.\nFrom past industry examples, only a handful of companies, like Analog Device for its\nrange of accelerometer or Motorola for its pressure sensors, have promoted the integrated\nprocess - and all are big companies having market reaching millions of chips. The hybrid\napproach in the other hand is used by many more companies on the market. For example\nFigure 2.4 shows a hybrid solution from SensoNor, the pressure sensor SP15.\nFigure 2.4: Hybrid integration in a pressure sensor (Courtesy SensoNor AS - An Infineon\nTechnologies Company).\nThe MEMS chip on the left is wire bonded to the ASIC on the right and both are mounted\nin a lead frame before encapsulation in the same package. The advantage of this solution\nis that both chips can use the best process without compromise and may achieve a better\noverall yield. However compactness and reliability suffers from the additional elements\nand the packaging becomes slightly more complicated. Moreover the electronic is\nsomewhat further from the sensing element and this may introduce additional noise if the\nsignal is small. It is this last argument that has pushed AD to develop its integrated\naccelerometer range.\n2.5. Sensors technology\nSensing is certainly a quality that we associate with living being. A stone does not sense,\nbut can a silicon circuit do it? Of course, the answer is yes, and MEMS have increased\ntremendously the number of physical parameters that are sensed by silicon.\n\nSensing can be formally defined by the ability to transform energy in the environment to\nenergy inside a system. An example will be to convert the air temperature to an electrical\nsignal by using a thermo-couple. At the heart of the sensor is the ability to perform the\nenergy transformation, a process usually called transduction. MEMS sensor ability to\nmeasure different parameters as pressure, acceleration, magnetic field, force, chemical\nconcentration, etc is based on a limited number of transduction principles compatible with\nminiaturization.\nThe oldest MEMS sensor that gained huge popularity was the pressure sensor and it was\nbased on the piezoresistive effect. Piezoresistivity can be described by the change of\nresistance of a material when it is submitted to stress. This effect is known since the 19th\ncentury in metals, but it was only in the mid 1950s that it was recognized that\nsemiconductor and particularly silicon had huge piezoresistive coefficient compared to\nmetal [4]. The MEMS designer will place resistors obtained by doping silicon where the\nstress variation is maximal, for example at the edge of a membrane in the case of a\npressure sensor. Then a simple Wheatstone bridge circuit (Figure 2.5) could be used to\nconvert the resistance change to a voltage difference. Actually, it is simple to show that if\nthere is a single variable resistor in the bridge and if ∆R << R then\nVin\nVout ≈ 4R ∆R .\nMoreover, if a judicious choice of variable resistors allows reaching the configuration\nshown in the right (where the variation of two variable resistors is opposite to the\nvariation of the two other), then the sensitivity of the bridge increases fourfold and\nVin\nVout =\n∆R .\nR\nVout\nVo ut\nVi n\nVi n\n+\n+\n+\n+\n-\n-\n-\n-\nR\nR\n∆\nR+ R\n∆\nR+\nR\n∆\nR+ R\n∆\nR\nR\n∆\nR\nR\nR\nFigure 2.5: Resistors in a Wheatstone bridge with (left) one variable resistor, or (right)\nfour variable resistors.\nThe difficulty of relating stress with resistance change in silicon, and actually in most\ncrystals, has to do with their anisotropy. Actually, all the physical parameter of silicon,\nlike Young's modulus or conductivity, depends on the direction with respect to the crystal\naxes in which they are measured. Thus, a complete treatment of piezoresistivity will\ninvolve complex mathematical object called tensors. However for the most important\ncases the equation describing the relative change of resistance can be cast in a simple form:\n∆R = π σ + π σ\nl\nl\nt\nt\nR\nwhere πi is the piezoresistive coefficient and σi the stress component along the direction\nparallel to the current flow (l longitudinal) or perpendicular to it (t transverse). The\npiezoresistive coefficients in silicon depend on the type of doping and are larger for p\n\ntype resistors. For resistors placed along the (110) direction, that is, parallel to the wafer\n-11\n-11\nflat in (100) wafers, we have πl ≈ 71.8 ⋅ 10\nPa-1 and πt ≈-66.3 ⋅ 10\nPa-1.\nFigure 2.6: Typical position of piezoresistors for a square membrane on (100) Si wafer.\nOn a square membrane, for symmetry reasons, the stress in the middle of a side is\nessentially perpendicular to that side. Piezoresistor placed parallel or perpendicular to the\nside at that point will be, respectively, under transverse or longitudinal stress. As the πl\nand πt are about the same magnitude but of opposite sign, the resistance of the two upper\nand lower resistor in Figure 2.6 will increase when the membrane deforms while the\nresistance of the right and left resistors will decrease. It is thus possible to connect the four\nidentical resistors in a full bridge configuration, as shown in Figure 2.5, and the bridge\nsensitivity simplifies to:\n70⋅10-11Vin\nVout ≈\nσ\nR\nmax\nwhere Vin is the bridge polarization voltage, σmax the maximum stress in the membrane\nand R the nominal value of the piezoresistors.\nPiezoresitivity is not only used for pressure sensor but find also application in acceleration\nor force sensors. Unfortunately, the simplicity of the method is counterbalanced by a\nstrong dependence on temperature that has to be compensated for most commercial\nproducts by more complex circuitry that the elementary Wheatstone bridge.\nCapacitive sensing is independent of the material used and is simply based on the\nvariation of capacitance that happens when the geometry of a capacitor is changing.\nCapacitance is generally proportional to\nA\nC ∝ε0εr g\nwhere A is the area of the electrodes, g the distance between them and εr the permittivity\nof the material separating them (actually, for a plane capacitor as shown above, the\nproportionality factor is 1). A change in any of these parameters will be measured as a\nchange of capacitance and all three variables have been used in MEMS sensing. For\nexample, whereas chemical or humidity sensor may be based on a change of εr, some\naccelerometers have been based on a change in g or in A.\nIf the dielectric in the capacitor is air, capacitive sensing is essentially independent of\ntemperature but contrary to piezoresitivity, capacitive sensing requires complex readout\nelectronics. Still the sensitivity of the method can be very large and, for example, Analog\n\nDevice used for his range of accelerometer a comb capacitor having a suspended electrode\nwith varying gap. Measurement showed that the integrated electronics circuit could\nresolve a change of the gap distance of only 20 pm, a mere 1/5th of the silicon inter-atomic\ndistance.\nA third commonly used transduction mechanism is based on piezoelectricity.\nPiezoelectricity occurs when stress applied on a material induces the apparition of charge\non its surface. Silicon does not present piezoelectricity but crystalline quartz has a large\npiezoelectric coefficient and other material like ZnO or PZT can be deposited in thin films\npossessing piezoelectric properties. The advantage of piezoelectricity is that it can be used\nto sense stress but also as an actuator too. Actually a difference of potential applied on\ntwo sides of a piezoelectric layer will induce its deformation. Thus piezoelectric material\ncan be excited in vibration and the vibration sensed with the same structure. This has been\nthe heart of the quartz watch since its invention in the 1970's, but it is also used for\ndifferent inertial MEMS sensor like gyroscope.\nMagnetic sensing, although less often used, has its supporters mainly because it is a non-\ncontact sensing mechanism with a fairly long range. Its main application has to be found\nin the (giant)magnetoresistive effect used inside the hard-disk head. However other uses\nof magnetic sensing have been tested and for example some sensors have been based on\nthe Hall effect, taking advantage of the simplicity to manufacture this sensing element.\n2.6. Actuator technology\nSince the industrial revolution humans know that machines can perform task with more\nforce and endurance that them. Bulldozers moving around with their huge engine and\npushing big rocks with their powerful pneumatic actuators are probably a good example\nof what a big machine can do. But what will be the function of a micro-sized actuator?\nType\nForce\nStroke\nEfficiency\nProcessability\nElectromagnetic\n+\n+\n-\n-\nGap\n-\n+\n+\nclosing\nElectrostatic Comb\n-\n+\n+\n+\ndrive\nSDA\n+\n+\nPiezoelectric\n+\n-\n+\n-\nBimorph\n+\n+\nHeatuator\n+\nThermal\nShape\nmemory\nalloy\nThermo\nfluidic\n+\n+\n\n+\n-\n+\n-\nTable 2.3: Comparison of common micro-mechanical actuators.\nThe main parameters useful to describe an actuator are its force and its stroke. However\nwe have seen previously all forces decrease with the scale, thus we can not expect to\nmove big rocks around - but only micro-rocks. The micro-actuators are currently used to\n\nact on micro-object, typically one part of a MEMS device. It would interesting to have\nenough force and stroke to allow actuator to help interface human and machine by\nproviding force feedback for example, but micro-actuators are still unable to do that\nproperly.\nStill a wide range of possibilities exists that transform internal energy of a system (usually\nelectrical energy) to energy in the environment (in the case of MEMS, generally\nmechanical energy). Sometime the conversion from electric energy to mechanical energy\nis direct but often another intermediate energy form is used. For example, the heatuator, a\nform of thermal actuator, uses current to generate heat which in turn becomes strain and\ndisplacement.\nThe MEMS actuators can be conveniently classified according to the origin of their main\nenergy form. In Table 2.3 comparison of the most common MEMS actuators, efficiency\nrefers to the loss existing in the actuator conversion of electrical energy to mechanical\nenergy and processability to the easiness of fabrication for the type of actuator considered.\n2.6.1. Magnetic actuator\nElectromagnetic actuation is well known for providing the actuator used in house\nappliances, toys, watches, relays... The principle of electromagnetic motor is well known\nand it is tempting to miniaturize such a versatile device to use it in the micro-world.\nHowever an electromagnetic motor with its coils, armature and bearings prove a\ntremendous task for micro-fabrication and so far nobody has been able to batch produced\na motor less than 1mm diameter.\nStill magnetic actuation has many proponents and some version of linear actuator have\nbeen used in different devices. Such a mobile armature actuator is shown in Figure 2.7,\nwhere by increasing the current in the coil the mobile armature is attracted along the x\ndirection to align with the fixed armature.\nFigure 2.7: Mobile armature magnetic actuator\nThe magnetic force produced on the mobile armature is linked to the change of reluctance\nand is given approximately by [11] :\n⎛\n⎞\n( )\nnI\n⎜\n⎜\nμ0A\n⎟\n⎟\nFma =\n⎜\nμ L ⎟\n2w\n⎜ gμ +\n⎟\n⎝\n⎠\nμ\nFrom this equation it is clear that the force is non linear with the current, and assuming a\nconstant resistance for the coil, the force will also depend on the square of the coil voltage.\nAlthough this force does not scale very favorably, the possibility to increase the current at\nsmall scale, because the heat can be dissipated more quickly, still allows producing\nrelatively strong force. However the main difficulty that prevent the wide spread use of\nthis type of actuator in a MEMS component is the fabrication of the coil. In that case the\n\nmost convincing approach proposed so far are most probably those using a hybrid\narchitecture, where the magnetic circuit is fabricated using micro-fabrication but the coil\nis obtained with more conventional techniques and later assembled with the MEMS part.\nActually some design have shown that the coil does not need to be microfabricated at all\nand can be placed in the package, taking benefit of the long range action of the magnetic\nfield.\nFinally it should be noted that magnetic actuation can used in conjunction with ferro\nmagnetic material to provide bistable actuator where two positions can be maintained\nwithout power consumption. A permanent magnet placed in the package is used to\nmaintain the magnetized ferro-magnetic material in place. Then, when we send a current\npulse of the right polarity in a coil wound around the ferro-magnetic material we invert its\nmagnetization and the actuator switch to its second state. NTT has been producing since at\nleast 1995 a fiber optic switch based on a moving fiber with a ferro-nickel sleeve that has\ntwo stable positions in front of two output fibers [12]. The device will consume power\nonly during the brief time where the current pulse is sent and can maintain its position for\nyears.\n2.6.2. Electrostatic actuator\nA physical principle that leads itself well to integration with MEMS technology is\nelectrostatics. Actually by applying a potential difference between two elements, they\ndevelop opposite charges and start attracting each other. This principle has known several\napplication among which, the comb-drive actuator, the gap-closing actuator and the\nscratch drive actuator are the most commonly used (Figure 2.8).\nThe force developed between two electrodes is proportional to the change (derivative) of\ntheir capacitance multiplied by the square of the voltage ( F ∝ dC / dx V2 ). Thus\nelectrostatic actuators develop force basically non-linear with the voltage.\nFigure 2.8: Different type of electrostatic actuators.\nThe comb-drive actuator was invented by W. Tang [13] at UC Berkeley and it generally\nallows motion in the direction parallel to the finger length. The force produced by n\nfingers in the rotor is approximately given by\nh\nF\n≈ nε\nV\ncd\n0 g\nwhere we see the expected dependence with the square of the voltage and notice that it is\nindependent of the displacement x. The proportionality factor is ε0, a small quantity\nindeed, hinting to a small force generated per finger, in the order of a few 10nN. Of\ncourse the number of fingers can reach 100 or more and the actuator can be made thicker\n(larger h) to increase the force proportionally. This actuator has been used repeatedly in\nMEMS component, for example in the original Analog Devices accelerometer or in the\nfiber optic switch from Sercalo.\n\nThe gap-closing actuator usually delivers larger force (proportional to A) again non linear\nwith the applied voltage, but additionally the force now depends on the displacement x.\nA\nF\n= ε\nV\ngc\n2x\nIt can be shown that, when the actuator is used in conjunction with a spring to retain the\nrotor electrode, the rotor electrode position can only be controlled over a limited range.\nActually as soon as the rotor electrode has moved by one third of the original gap width,\nsnap-in suddenly occurs and the rotor comes into contact with the stator. This behavior\ncan be advantageous if the actuator is used for bi-stable operation, but preventive\nmeasures should be taken to avoid electrodes short-circuit. Actually, the actuator behind\nthe Texas Instruments' DLP is a gap-closing electrostatic actuator working in torsion with\nthe two stable states position fixed by resting posts.\nThe scratch drive actuator is a more recent invention by T. Akiyama [14] and although it\nis actuated by electrostatic force, the friction force is the real driving force. As we can see\nin the diagram, the electrostatic energy is stored in the SDA strain while its front part, the\nbushing tilts. When the electrostatic force is released, the strain is released which produce\ndisplacement when the bushing return to its rest orientation.\nThe main advantage of this actuator is that it is able to produce a rather large force\n(100μN), which can be even increased by connecting multiple actuators together. Actually\nthe SDA has been used as an actuator in the 2D optical switch matrix that was developed\nby Optical Micro Machines (OMM) and which received the stringent Telcordia\ncertification.\n2.6.3. Thermal actuator\nThe thermal energy used by this class of MEMS actuator comes almost invariably from\nthe Joule effect when a current flows through a resistive element. These actuators are\ngenerally relatively strong and their main drawback is most probably their speed, although\nat micro-scale the heat is quickly radiated away and operating frequency up to 1 kHz can\nbe achieved.\nBimorph actuators are the most common type of thermal actuator. The bimaterial actuator,\nwell known from the bimetallic version used in cheap temperature controller, and the\nheatuator (Figure 2.9) are both bending actuator where bending is induced by a difference\nof strain in two members connected together.\nFigure 2.9: Thermal bimorph actuators\nThe bimaterial actuator obtains this effect by using two different materials with different\nexpansion coefficients that are placed at the same temperature. The heatuator [15] uses a\n\nsingle material, simplifying its fabrication, and obtain different strain by maintaining a\ndifference of temperature between the two arms. Actually as the current flow through the\nactuator the wider 'cold' arm will have a lower resistance and thus generate less heat than\nthe other narrow 'hot' arm. It should be noted that the force produced by these two\nactuators decreases with the deformation. At maximum displacement all the energy is\nused to bend the actuator and no external force is produced. One heatuator can produce\nforce in the 10 μN range and they can be connected together or made thicker to produce\nlarger force.\nThe thermo-pneumatic actuator is another actuator where the expansion of a heated fluid\ncan bulge a membrane and produce a large force. This principle has been used to control\nvalve aperture in micro-fluidic components.\nFinally the shape memory effect is also controlled by temperature change and traditionally\nbelongs to the class of thermal actuator. The shape memory effect appears in single crystal\nmetal like copper and in many alloys among which the more popular are NiTi (nitinol) or\nNixTiyCuz. In such shape memory alloys (SMA) after a high temperature treatment step\ntwo solid phases will appear one at low temperature (martensite phase) and the other at\nhigh temperature (austenite phase). The alloy is rather soft and can be easily deformed at\nlow temperature in the martensite phase. However, upon heating the alloy above its phase\ntransition temperature it will turn to austenite phase and returns to its original shape. This\nprocess creates large recovery forces that can be used in an actuator. The temperature\ndifference between the two phases can be as low as 10°C and can be controlled by\nchanging the composition of the alloy. In principle the alloy can be 'trained' and will then\nshift from a high temperature shape to a low temperature shape and vice-versa when the\ntemperature is changed. In practice training is difficult and micro-actuators based on SMA\nare one way actuator, the restoring force being often brought by an elastic member,\nlimiting the total deformation. The most common application of such material has been\nfor various micro-grippers, but its use remains limited because of the difficulty in\ncontrolling the deposition of SMA thin-films.\n\n3. How MEMS are made\n3.1. Overview of MEMS fabrication process\nMicro-fabrication is the set of technologies used to manufacture micro-sized mechanical\ndevices. This task can unfortunately not rely on the traditional mechanical fabrication\ntechniques such as milling, drilling, turning, forging and casting because of the small\nfeatures. The fabrication techniques had thus to come from another source. As MEMS\ndevices have about the same feature size as integrated circuits, MEMS fabrication\ntechnology quickly took logically inspiration from microelectronics. Techniques like\nphotolithography, thin film deposition by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) or physical\nvapor deposition (PVD), thin film growth by oxidation and epitaxy, doping by ion\nimplantation or diffusion, wet etching, dry etching, etc have all been adopted by the\nMEMS technologists. Other chapters have already described in details these techniques.\nHowever, as MEMS and IC fabrication are different, these techniques have often evolved\nas they were applied to MEMS and we report their new capabilities. Moreover, MEMS\nhas spurred many unique fabrication techniques that we will also describe in our\npanorama of MEMS fabrication where we will introduce bulk micromachining, surface\nmicromachining, LIGA, etc [16].\nMEMS fabrication often tries to be a batch process to benefit from the same potential low\ncost as IC. As such it often starts with a wafer (silicon, polymer, glass...) that may play an\nactive role in the final device or may only be a substrate on which the MEMS is built. The\nwafer is processed with a succession of thin film deposition, doping, photolithography and\nwet/dry etching steps to form the device. The devices have then to pass through a special\nstep to free the mechanical parts called 'release step' which can be done before or after the\ndicing. Finally the components are assembled, packaged and tested.\n3.2. The MEMS materials\nThe choice of a good material for MEMS application is no more based on carrier mobility,\nbut on more mechanical aspect: small or controllable internal stress, low processing\ntemperature, compatibility with other materials, thick layer deposition and patterning\npossibilities... In addition, depending on the field of application, the material often needs\nto have extra properties. RF MEMS will want to be based on material with small loss\ntangent (for example high resistivity silicon), optical MEMS may need a transparent\nsubstrate, BioMEMS will need bio-compatibility, if not for the substrate, for a coating\nadhering well to the substrate, sensor application will need a material showing\npiezoresistance or piezoelectricity...\nActually, because the issue of material contamination is much less important in MEMS\nthan in IC fabrication, the MEMS designer often tries to use the material presenting the\nbest properties for his unique application.\nStill, from its microelectronics' root MEMS has retained the predominant use of silicon\nand its compounds, silicon (di)oxide (SiO2) and silicon nitride (SixNy). But actually, it was\nnot purely coincidental, silicon is, as K. Petersen claimed in a famous paper [17], an\nexcellent mechanical material. Actually, silicon is almost as strong but lighter than steel,\nhas large critical stress and no elasticity limit at room temperature as it is a perfect crystal\nensuring that it will recover from large strain. Unfortunately it is brittle and this may pose\nproblem in handling wafer, but it is rarely a source of failure for MEMS components. For\nsensing application silicon has a large piezoresitive coefficient, and for optical MEMS it\nis transparent at the common telecommunication wavelengths.\n\nIn addition silicon has a stable oxide easy to grow at elevated temperature that is\ntransparent and thermally and electrically insulating. Actually this oxide has the smallest\ncoefficient of thermal expansion of all known materials. Those properties are often put to\ngood use during MEMS fabrication, where oxide support will be used to thermally\ninsulate a pixel of an IR camera for example.\nRecently, a new substrate based on silicon and coming from IC industry has made its\nentry in the MEMS material list: the SOI (Silicon on Insulator) wafer. This substrate is\ncomposed of a thick silicon handle of several hundred μm, a thin layer of oxide of 1 or 2\nμm and on top the silicon device layer. The thickness of this last layer is what differentiate\nthe IC and the MEMS SOI wafers: in the first case it will reach at most a few μm where in\nthe later case, the thickness can reach 100μm or more. The presence of the sandwiched\noxide layer allows producing fully functioning device like the Sercalo's optical switch,\ncomplete with actuator and alignment feature, with one single etch!\nAnother interesting compound is silicon nitride (SixNy), which is stronger than silicon and\ncan be deposited in thin layer with an excellent control of stress to produce 1μm thick\nmembrane of several cm2. In general stoichiometric nitride film (Si3N4) will show tensile\nstress, but increasing the Si content will invariably ends in obtaining a compressive stress.\nA good control of stress is also obtained during deposition of poly-crystalline silicon.\nDuring LPCVD deposition, increasing the temperature from 560°C to 620°C lowers the\nas-deposited stress, changing the compressive stress usually present in polysilicon films to\ntensile stress [18]. A subsequent high temperature (>950°C) anneal result in layer with\nvery low stress, making Poly-Si the material of choice for building multi-layered structure\non silicon surface. For example the Sandia National Lab's Summit V process stacks five\nlayer of poly-silicon allowing an unparalleled freedom of design for complex MEMS\nstructure. Closing the list of silicon compound we can add a newcomer, silicon carbide\nSiC. SiC has unique thermal properties (albeit not yet on par with diamond) and has been\nused in high temperature sensor.\nBut silicon and its derivative is not the only choice for MEMS, many other materials are\nalso used because they posses some unique properties. For example, other semiconductors\nlike InP have also been micromachined mainly to take advantage of their photonics\ncapabilities and serve as tunable laser source. Quartz crystal has strong piezoelectric effect\nthat has been put into use to build resonant sensors like gyroscope or mass sensors.\nBiocompatibility will actually force the use of a limited list of already tested and approved\nmaterial, or suggest the use of durable coating.\nGlass is only second to silicon in its use in MEMS fabrication because it can easily form\ntight bond with silicon and also because it can be used to obtain bio-compatible channels\nfor BioMEMS.\nPolymers are also often used for BioMEMS fabrication where they can be tailored to\nprovide biodegradability or bioabsorbability. The versatility of polymers makes them\ninteresting for other MEMS application, and for example the reflow appearing at\nmoderate temperature has been used to obtain lenses in optical MEMS. This reflow\nproperty allows also molding, making polymer MEMS a cheap alternative to silicon based\nsystem, particularly for micro-fluidic application. Recently the availability of\nphotosensitive polymers like SU8 [19] than can be spun to thickness exceeding 100 μm\nand patterned has broadly increased the possibility to build polymer structure.\nThis quick introduction to MEMS materials needs to mention metals. If their conductivity\nis of course a must when they are used as electrical connection like in IC, metals can also\nbe used to build structures. Here, their ability to be grown to moderate thickness at a\nmoderate temperature by electroplating is what spurred Texas Instrument to base their\n\nDLP process on aluminum mirrors. In other applications, micro-mold are often built in\nelectroplated nickel, whereas gold may be used for its reflective properties in optical\nMEMS, while nitinol (NiTi), presenting a strong shape memory effect, will become\nactuator.\n3.3. Bulk micromachining, wet and dry etching\n3.3.1. Introduction\nBulk micromachining refers to the formation of micro structures by removal of materials\nfrom bulk substrates. The bulk substrate in wafer form can be silicon, glass, quartz,\ncrystalline Ge, SiC, GaAs, GaP or InP. The methods commonly used to remove excess\nmaterial are wet and dry etching that yield profile that can be orientation-independent\n(isotropic) or orientation-dependent (anisotropic).\nFigure 3.1 shows a simplified process of bulk micromachining to build MEMS structures\non silicon-on-oxide (SOI) wafer by deep reactive ion etching (DRIE), a MEMS dry etch\ntechnique. Unlike the thin device layer of SOI wafers for IC, the SOI wafers used in\nMEMS usually have a device layer thickness between 10 and 200μm used here as bulk\nsubstrate. After photolithography, the wafer is etched with DRIE to form high aspect ratio\nsilicon structures, and the buried silicon dioxide is used as an effective etching stop.\nStripping off the resist by O2 plasma and sacrificial etch of the oxide using HF to release\nthe microstructure finish the device. This simple, yet powerful, technique needs only one\nmask to obtain working devices, and it is understandably used in commercial products.\nThe best known example is the optical switch produced by Sercalo, a company founded\nby the inventor of the technique C. Marxer.\nFigure 3.1: Bulk micromachining of SOI wafer by DRIE\n3.3.2. Isotropic and anisotropic wet etching\nWet etching is obtained by immersing the material in a chemical bath that dissolves the\nsurface not covered by a protective layer. The main advantage of the technique is that it\ncan be quick, uniform, very selective and cheap. The etching rate and the resulting profile\n\ndepend on the material, the chemical, the temperature of the bath, the presence of\nagitation, and the etch stop technique used if any.\nFigure 3.2: Isotropic and Anisotropic wet etching\nWet etching is divided between isotropic etching and anisotropic etching. Isotropic etch\nhappens when the chemical etches the bulk material at the same rate in all directions,\nwhile anisotropic etch sees different etching rate along different directions. For substrates\nmade of homogeneous and amorphous material, like glass, wet etching must be isotropic,\nalthough an increased surface etching is sometimes observed. However, for materials that\nare not isotropic, e.g. crystalline silicon, the etching can either be isotropic or anisotropic,\ndepending on the chemical used. Isotropic etchants are usually acidic, while anisotropic\netchants are alkaline.\nFigure 3.2 compares the isotropic and anisotropic wet etching of silicon. Top-left inset\nshows isotropic etching of silicon when the bath is agitated assuring fresh chemical\nconstantly reaches the bottom of the trench and resulting in a truly isotropic etch. The\netchant can be HNA, which is a mixture of hydrofluoric acid (HF), nitric acid (HNO3),\nand acetic acid (CH3COOH). The etching rate for silicon can be as high as 80μm/min, and\noxide can be used as mask material as its etch rate is only 30 to 80nm/min. Isotropic wet\netching is used for thin layer or when the rounded profile is advantageous, to obtain\nchannels for fluids for example. In a HNA system, nitric acid acts as an oxidant, and HF\ndissolves the oxide by forming the water soluble H2SiF6. The two step of the simplified\nreaction are:\nSi + HNO3 + H2O → SiO2 + HNO2 + H2\nSiO2 + 6HF → H2SiF6 + 2 H2O\nEtching under the mask edge or underetch is unavoidable with isotropic wet etching.\nMoreover, the etch rate and profile are sensitive to solution agitation and temperature,\nmaking it difficult to control the geometries of the deep etch usually needed for MEMS.\nAnisotropic etching developed in the late 60s can overcome these problems.\nThe lower part of Figure 3.2 shows features obtained by etching a (100) wafer with a\nKOH solution. The etched profile is clearly anisotropic, reveling planes without rounded\nshape and very little underetch. Potassium hydroxide (KOH), tetramethyl ammonium\nhydroxide (TMAH) and ethylene diamine pyrocatechol (EDP) are common chemicals\nused for anisotropic etching of silicon. The anisotropy has its source in the different etch\nrate existing between the different crystal planes because they have different electronic\n\ndensity. Three important crystal planes, the (100) plane, (110) plane and (111) plane have\nbeen illustrated in Figure 3.3. The three orientations <100>, <110>, and <111> are the\nrespective directions normal to these planes.\nFigure 3.3: Main planes in the cubic lattice of silicon\nThe anisotropy can be very large and for example, for silicon and KOH, the etching rate\nratio can reach 400 between (100) and (111) planes and 600 between (110) and (111)\nplanes - effectively allowing to consider the (111) plane as an etch stop. With different\ncombinations of wafer orientations and mask patterns, very sophisticated structures such\nas cavities, grooves, cantilevers, through holes and bridges can be fabricated. For example,\nif the (100) wafers in Figure 3.2 shows an angle of 54.7° between the (111) plane and the\nsurface, typically producing V-grooves, (110) oriented wafer will present an angle of 90°\nbetween these planes resulting in vertical walls U-grooves. To obtain these grooves, the\nmask pattern edges need to be aligned with the edge of the (111) planes. For a (100) wafer\nit is simple because the groove edge are along the <110> direction, that is parallel to the\nmain wafer flat. Moreover a rectangular pattern will expose four sloping (111) planes and\nprovide a simple way to obtain precisely defined pits and membrane. (110) wafers are\nmore difficult to handle, and to obtain a U-groove the side should be tilted by an angle of\n125.26° with respect to the <110> wafer flat. In addition to obtain a four-sided pit, the\ntwo other sides should make a 55° angle with the flat direction - defining a non-\nrectangular pit that is seldom used for membranes.\nIf the control of the lateral etching by using the (111) planes is usually excellent,\ncontrolling the etching depth is more complicated. The first possibility is to use the self\nlimiting effect appearing when two sloping (111) planes finally contact each other,\nproviding the typical V-grooves of Figure 3.2. However producing the flat membranes of\nprecise thickness needed for pressure sensors required a better approach that what can be\nachieved by simply controlling the etching time. MEMS technologist have tackled this\nproblem by developing different etch stop techniques that allow reducing by one or two\norder of magnitude the etch speed when the solution reach a particular depth.\nThe electrochemical etch stop works by first creating a diode junction for example by\nusing epitaxial growth or doping of a n-layer over a p-substrate. Proper polarization of the\nsubstrate and the chemical bath allows for the etching to completely stop at the junction.\nThis process yields an excellent control over the final membrane thickness that is only\ndetermined by the thickness of the epitaxial layer, and thus can be better than 1% over a\nwhole wafer. Another popular method that does not require epitaxial growth is to heavily\ndope the surface of silicon with boron by diffusion or implantation, triggering a decrease\nof the etch rate by at least one order of magnitude. However, note that if diffusion is used,\nthe high boron concentration (>1019 cm-3) at the surface will decrease substantially the\npiezoresistive coefficient value making piezoresistors less sensitive. Ion implantation can\novercome this problem by burying the doped layer a few μm under the surface, leaving a\nthin top layer untouched for the fabrication of the piezoresistors.\nActually, the seemingly simple membrane process requires two tools specially designed\nfor MEMS fabrication. Firstly, to properly align the aperture of the backside mask with\n\nthe piezoresistor or other features on the front side (Figure 2.5) a double-side mask aligner\nis required. Different approaches have been used (infrared camera, image storage, folded\noptical path...) by the various manufacturers (Suss Microtec, OAI, EVGroup...) to tackle\nthis problem, resulting in a very satisfying registration accuracy that can reach 1μm for\nthe best systems. Secondly, etching the cavity below the membrane needs a special\nprotection tool, that in the case of electrochemical etch stop is also used for insuring the\nsubstrate polarization. Actually the presence of this cavity inevitably weakens the wafer\nand to avoid wafer breakage, the membrane is usually etched in the last step of the process.\nAt that time, the front side will have already received metallization which generally\ncannot survive the prolonged etch and needs to be protected. This protection can be\nobtained by using a thick protective wax, but more often a cleaner process is preferred\nbased on a mechanical chuck. The chuck is designed to allow quick loading and unloading\noperation, using O-ring to seal the front-side of the wafer and spring loaded contact to\nprovide bias for electrochemical etch-stop.\nThe chemical used during anisotropic etching are strong bases and it needs to rely on hard\nmask to protect the substrate. Some metals can be used here but generally silicon oxide is\npreferred with TMAH, while silicon nitride is used with KOH. Table 3.1 summarizes the\ncharacteristics of some anisotropic etching solution.\nSolution\nTemp\n(°C)\nSi (100)\netch rate\n(μm/min)\nEtching\nrate ratio\nMask\netch rate\n(nm/min)\nBoron\netch stop\n(cm-3\netch rate)\nRemarks\nKOH/water\n44g/100ml\n(30 wt.%)\n1.4\n400 for\n(100)/(111)\n600 for\n(110)/(111)\nSiO2 (3.5)\nSi3N4 (<0.01)\n>1020\nrate / 20\n+ largest etching\nrate ratio\n- K ion degrades\nCMOS perf.\n- etch SiO2 fast\nTMAH/water\n28g/100ml\n(22 wt.%)\n30 for\n(100)/(111)\n50 for\n(110)/(111)\nSiO2 (0.2)\nSi3N4 (<0.01)\n4-1020\nrate / 40\n+ SiO2 mask\n+CMOS compat.\n- large overtech\nEDP (Ethylene\ndiamine\n/pyrocatechol\n/water)\n750ml/120g\n/240ml\n1.25\n35 for\n(100)/(111)\nSiO2\n(0.2~0.5)\nSi3N4 (0.1)\nAu, Cr, Ag,\nCu, Ta\n(negligible)\n7-1019\nrate / 50\n+ SiO2 mask\n+ no metal etch\n+CMOS compat.\n- large overtech\n- toxic\nTable 3.1: Characteristics of some anisotropic etchants.\nOf course anisotropic wet etching has its limitation. The most serious one lies with the\nneed to align the sides of the pattern with the crystal axes to benefit from the (111) plane\netch-stop, severely limiting the freedom of layout. A typical example is when we want to\ndesign a structure with convex corners - that is instead of designing a pit, we now want an\nisland. The island convex corners will inevitably expose planes which are not the (111)\nplanes and will be etched away slowly, finally resulting in the complete disappearance of\nthe island. Although techniques have been developed to slow down the etch rate of the\ncorner by adding protruding 'prongs', these structures take space on the wafer and they\nfinally cannot give the same patterning freedom as dry etching techniques.\n\n3.3.3. Dry etching\nDry etching is a series of methods where the solid substrate surface is etched by gaseous\nspecies. Plasma is usually involved in the process to increase etching rate and supply\nreacting ions and radicals. The etching can be conducted physically by ion bombardment\n(ion etching or sputtering and ion-beam milling), chemically through a chemical reaction\noccurring at the solid surface (plasma etching or radical etching), or by mechanisms\ncombining both physical and chemical effects (reactive ion etching or RIE). These\nmethods have various etching selectivity and achieve different etching profiles. Usually\nthe etching is more anisotropic and vertical when the etching is more physical, while it is\nmore selective and isotropic when it is more chemical. Most of these methods have\nalready been discussed in earlier chapters, but they take a different twist when they are\napplied to MEMS fabrication because in general MEMS necessitates deep (>5μm) etching.\nSeveral techniques have been developed to address this issue, like the SCREAM process\ndeveloped in Cornell University or the cryogenic process based on the sidewall\npasssivation that appear at low temperature in a SF6/O2 plasma. However, nowadays,\nthese processes seem superseded by the deep reactive ion etching (DRIE). DRIE has\nreached a large popularity in recent years among MEMS community and the tools\nproduced by Adixen (Alcatel), Surface Technology Systems (STS) and Oxford System\ncan make high aspect ratio structures (>25) with vertical sidewalls (>89°) at a decent\netching rate (6μm/min or more).\nA standard DRIE setting uses high density inductively coupled plasma (ICP) as the\nplasma source, and usually adopts the patented \"Bosch process\". The Bosch process is a\nrepetition of two alternating steps: passivation and etching. In the passivation step, C4F8\ngas flows into the ICP chamber forming a polymer protective layer (n (-CF2-)) on all the\nsurfaces. In the following etching step, the SF6 gas in the plasma chamber is dissociated to\nF-radicals and ions. The vertical ion bombardment sputters away the polymer at the trench\nbottom, while keeping the sidewalls untouched and still protected by the polymer. Then\nthe radicals chemically etch the silicon on the bottom to make the trench deeper. By\ncarefully controlling the duration of the etching and passivation steps, trenches with\naspect ratio as high as 25:1 have been routinely fabricated. Figure 3.4 is a SEM picture of\nsome structures fabricated by DRIE on a SOI wafer.\nFigure 3.4: 50μm thick structures fabricated by DRIE on SOI.\nThe main issues with DRIE are the presence of ripple with an amplitude over 100nm on\nthe vertical edge due to the repetition of etching and passivating steps, and the severe\nsilicon undertech that happens when the etching reach the buried oxide layer of SOI.\n\nHowever, the most recent DRIE tools have managed to tackle these two problems\nsatisfactorily, by tweaking the recipe and usually trading a bit of etching speed for\nimproving another etching parameter.\n3.4. Surface micromachining\nUnlike bulk micromachining in which microstructures are formed by etching into the bulk\nsubstrate, surface micromachining builds up structures by adding materials, layer by layer,\non the surface of the substrate. The thin film layers deposited are typically 1~5μm thick,\nsome acting as structural layer and others as sacrificial layer. Dry etching is usually used\nto define the shape of the structure layers, and a final wet etching step releases them from\nthe substrate by removing the supporting sacrificial layer.\nFigure 3.5: Basic process sequence of surface micromachining\nA typical surface micromachining process sequence used to build a micro bridge is shown\nin Figure 3.5. Phosphosilicate glass (PSG) is first deposited by LPCVD to form the\nsacrificial layer. After the PSG layer has been patterned, a structural layer of low-stress\npolysilicon is added. Then the polysilicon layer is patterned with another mask in CF4 +\nO2 plasma. Finally, the PSG sacrificial layer is etched away by an HF solution and the\npolysilicon bridge is released.\nStructural material\nSacrificial material\nEtchant\nPolysilicon\nOxide(PSG, LTO, etc)\nBuffered HF\nSi3N4\nPoly-Si\nKOH\nSiO2\nPoly-Si\nEDP/TMAH\nAluminum\nPhotoresist\nAcetone/O2 plasma\nPolyimide\nCu\nFerric chloride\nTi\nAu\nAmmonium iodide\nSiO2, Si3N4, metal\nPoly-Si\nXeF2\nTable 3.2: Combination of material and etchants for surface micromachining.\n\nThe selection of suitable sacrificial material depends on the structural material used and\non the availability of an etchant that can selectively etch the sacrificial material without\nsignificantly etching the structural materials or the substrate. Some combinations of\nstructural material and etchant are shown in table 3.2.\nAs a large variety of materials such as polysilicon, oxide, nitride, PSG, metals, diamond,\nSiC and GaAs can be deposited as thin film and many layers can be stacked, surface\nmicromachining can build very complicated micro structures. For example Sandia\nNational Laboratories is proposing a process with four polysilicon structural layers and\nfour oxide sacrificial layers, which has been used for fabricating complex locking\nmechanism for defense application. Figure 3.6 demonstrates surface micromachined\nmicro-mirrors fabricated using two polysilicon structural layers and an additional final\ngold layer to increase reflectivity. They have been assembled in 3D using\nmicromanipulator on a probe-station..\nFigure 3.6: A micro optical stage built by surface micromachining\nYet surface micromachining has to face several unique problems that need addressing to\nobtain working devices. During layer deposition, a strict control of the stress in the\nstructural layer has to be exerted. Compressive stress in a constrained member will cause\nit to buckle, while a gradient of stress across a cantilevered structure causes it to warp,\nresulting in both case in probable device failure.\nThe possibility to stack several layers brings freedom but also adds complexity. Actually\nthere is large chance that the topography created by the pattern on underlying layer will\ncreate havoc with the upper layer, as illustrated in Figure 3.7.\nFigure 3.7: Common surface micromachining issues.\n\nA common problem is the formation of strings of structural material, called 'stringers',\nduring the patterning of the upper layer. Actually the high anisotropy of the etching by\nRIE leaves some material where the layer is thicker because of the conformal deposition\nof the structural material. To avoid the problem during fabrication, the RIE etching time\nneeds to be substantially increased to fully etch the layer where it is thicker. For example\nthe MUMPS surface micromachining process proposed by the foundry MEMSCAP is\nusing an overteching of 100%, that is, the etching lasts twice the time needed to clear the\nmaterial in the flat zone. Another common issue is the likelihood of structure interference\nbetween the stacked layers. In Figure 3.7 we see that the topography creates an\nunintended protrusion below the top structural layer that will forbid it to move freely\nsideway - probably dooming the whole device. This problem can be tackled during layout,\nparticularly when the layout editor has a cross-section view, like L-Edit from Tanner\nResearch. However even a clever layout won't be able to suppress this problem\ncompletely and it will need to be addressed during fabrication. Actually polishing using\nCMP the intermediate sacrificial layer to make it completely flat, will avoid all\ninterference problems. For example, Sandia National Laboratory uses oxide CMP of the\nsecond sacrificial layer for their four layers SUMMiT V process.\nHowever, sometimes the interference may be a desired effect and for example the so\ncalled 'scissors' hinge [20] design shown in Figure 3.8 benefits greatly from it. As we see\nhere the protrusion below the upper layer helps to hold the hinge axis tightly. If we had to\nrely on lithography only, the gap between the axis and the fixed part in the first structural\nlayer would be at best 2μm, as limited by the design rules, and the axis will have too\nmuch play. However the protrusions below the staple reduce the gap to 0.75μm, the\nthickness of the second sacrificial layer, and the quality of the hinge is greatly increased.\nFigure 3.8: Tight clearance obtained by layer interference in a hinge structure.\nThe final step in surface macromachining process is the release - and this critical step has\nalso a fair amount of issues that need to be considered.\n3.5. Microstructure release\nThe release step, which is common to surface micromachining process and DRIE on SOI\ntechnology, is source of much technologist woes. Release is usually a wet process that is\nused to dissolve the sacrificial material under the structure to be freed. However the\n\nremoval rate is usually relatively slow because the sacrificial layer is only a few μm thick\nand the reaction becomes quickly diffusion limited. Then the depth of sacrificial layer\ndissolved under the structure will increase slowly with the etching time as\nd\n∝\nrelease\netch\nt\n.\nSimply said, releasing a structure twice as wide will take 4 times more time. However if\nthe etching lasts too long the chemical may start attacking the device structural material\ntoo. A first measure to avoid problems is to use compatible material and chemical, where\nthe sacrificial layer is etched quickly but other material not at all. A typical example is\ngiven by the DLP (Digital Light Processing) from Texas Instrument, where the structural\nlayer is aluminum and the sacrificial layer is a polymer. The polymer is removed with\noxygen plasma, and even prolonged release time won't affect the metal.\nThis ideal case is often difficult to reach and for example metals have often a finite etch\nrate in HF, which is used to remove PSG sacrificial layer. Thus to decrease the release\ntime we have to facilitate etching of the sacrificial layer by providing access hole for the\nchemical through the structural layer. In the case of Figure 3.6 for example, the mirror\nmetal starts to peel off after about 10 minutes in HF. However in about 5 minutes HF can\nonly reach 40 μm under a plate, thus we introduced 'release holes' spaced by roughly\n30μm in the middle of the mirror that can be seen as white dots here.\nFigure 3.7: Stiction phenomenon during release\nThe problems with wet release continue when you need to dry your sample. The meniscus\ncreated by the receding liquid/air interface tends to pull the structure against the substrate.\nThis intimate contact give rise to other surface forces like Van der Walls force, which will\nirremediably pin your structure to the substrate when the drying is complete, effectively\ndestroying your device. This phenomenom is referred as stiction (Figure 3.7). Strategies\nthat have been used to overcome this problem have tackled it at design and fabrication\nlevel. In surface micromachining the idea has been to reduce the contact surface by\nintroducing dimples under the structure. From the fabrication side, super-critical drying,\nwhere the liquid changes to gas without creating a receding meniscus, has also been\napplied successfully. Coating the structure with non-sticking layer (fluorocarbon,\nhydrophobic SAM...) has also proved successful and this method, albeit more complex,\nhas the added advantage to provide long lasting protection again sticking that could arise\nduring use.\nFinally, a completely different approach is to avoid wet release altogether and instead\nperform a dry release with a gas suppressing completely the sticking concern. In Table 3.2\n\nwe describe two popular methods, dissolving polymer sacrificial layer with O2 plasma,\nand using xenon difluoride (XeF2) to etch sacrificial silicon. The xenon difluoride is a gas\nshowing an excellent selectivity, having etching rate ratio close to 1000 with metal and up\nto 10000 with oxide. The gas has thus been used successfully to release very compliant or\nnano-sized oxide structures where silicon was used as the sacrificial material. The process\ndoes not use plasma, making the chamber rather simple, and several manufacturers like\nXactiX (in cooperation with STS), in the USA or PentaVacuum in Singapore are\nproposing tools to exploit the technology.\n3.6. Other microfabrication techniques\n3.6.1. Wafer bonding\nA review of MEMS fabrication technique cannot be complete without mentioning wafer\nbonding. Wafer bonding is an assembly technique where two or more precisely aligned\nwafers are bonded together. This method is at the frontier between a fabrication method\nand a packaging method and belong both to front-end and back-end process, another\nspecificities of MEMS, but at this stage it is not surprising anymore!\nWafer bonding has the potential to simplify fabrication method because structures can be\npatterned on both wafers and after bonding they will be part of the same device, without\nthe need for complex multi-layer fabrication process. Of course epoxy bonding can be\nused to bond wafers together but much better MEMS techniques exist.\nIntermediate-layer eutectic bonding is based on forming a eutectic alloy that will diffuse\ninto the target wafer and form the bond. For silicon-to-silicon bonding the intermediate\nlayer is often gold which form a eutectic alloy with silicon at 363°C.\nSilicon-to-silicon fusion bonding allows bonding two silicon wafers directly effectively\nachieving seamless bond possessing an exceptional strength and hermeticity. However the\ntechnique requires excellent flatness and high temperature, two hurdles that limit its use.\nThe most commonly used MEMS bonding methods is probably anodic bonding which is\nmainly used to bond silicon wafers with glass wafers. The technique work by applying a\nhigh voltage to the stacked wafers that induce migration of ion from glass to silicon,\nallowing a strong field assisted bond to form. This technique is commonly used to\nfabricate sensors allowing for example to obtain cavities with controlled pressure for\npressure sensor as shown in Figure 3.8. At the same time, the glass wafer provides wafer\nlevel packaging, protecting sensitive parts before back-end process. Another important\nuse of the method is to fabricate MEMS substrates such as SOI and SOG (silicon on glass)\nwafers.\nFigure 3.8: Silicon pressure sensor SP15 bonded with glass cover (Courtesy SensoNor AS\n- An Infineon Technologies Company).\n\n3.6.2. Micro-molding and LIGA\nOther methods exist where no material is removed but this time molded to achieve the\ndesired pattern. LIGA, a German acronym for lithography (LIthographie), electroforming\n(Galvanoformung), and molding (Abformung) is the mother of these methods.\nLIGA makes very high aspect ratio 3-D microstructures with non-silicon materials such as\nmetal, plastic or ceramics using replication or molding. LIGA process begins with X-ray\nlithography using a synchrotron source (e.g. energy of 2.4GeV and wavelength of 2A) to\nexpose a thick layer of X-ray photoresist (e.g. PMMA). Because of the incredibly small\nwavelength, diffraction effects are minimized and thick layer of photoresist can be\npatterned with sub-micron accuracy. The resist mold is subsequently used for\nelectroforming and metal (e.g. nickel in NiCl2 solution) is electroplated in the resist mold.\nAfter the resist is dissolved, the metal structure remains. This structure may be the final\nproduct but to lower down the costs, it usually serves as a mold insert for injection\nmolding or hot embossing. The possibility to replicate hundreds of part with the same\ninsert opens the door to cheap mass production. When the sub-micrometer resolution is\nnot much of a concern, pseudo-LIGA processes can be advantageously used. These\ntechniques avoid using the high cost X-ray source for the mold fabrication by replacing it\nby the thick photoresist SU8 and a standard UV exposure or even by fabricating a silicon\nmold using DRIE.\n3.6.3. Polymer MEMS\nBulk and surface micromachining can be classified as direct etch method, where the\ndevice pattern is obtained by removing material from the substrate or from deposited\nlayers. However, etching necessitates the use of lithography, which already includes\npatterning the photoresist, then why would we want to etch the lower layer when the\npattern is already here?\nActually lithography for MEMS has seen the emergence of ultra-thick photoresist that can\nbe spun up to several 100 μm and exposed with a standard mask aligner, providing a\nquick way to the production of micro-parts. SU8, a high-density negative photoresist can\nbe spun in excess of 200 μm and allows the fabrication of mechanical parts [19] of good\nquality. It is used in many applications ranging from bioMEMS with micro-parts for\ntissue scaffold or channels, for example to packaging, where it is used as buffer layer.\nAnother application of thick photo-patternable polymer is the fabrication of microlenses\nusing reflow at elevated temperature of thick positive photoresist pillars (e.g. AZ9260).\nNext to these major techniques, other microfabrication processes exist and keep emerging.\nThey all have their purpose and advantages and are often used for a specific application.\nFor example, quartz micromachining is based on anisotropic wet etching of quartz wafers\nto take benefit of its stable piezoelectric properties and build sensors like gyroscopes.\n3.7. MEMS packaging, assembly and test\nMEMS packaging, assembly and test problems are the aspects of the MEMS technology\nthat are the less mature. Actually, although the bookshelves seems to be replete with\nbooks discussing all the aspect of MEMS technology, we had to wait until 2004 to finally\nhave a reference book really discussing these three issues with real life examples [21].\nThe main problem faced by MEMS testing is that we now have to handle signal that are\nnot purely electrical, but optical, fluidic, inertial, chemical... Then, verifying the absence\nof defect needs the development of specialized system and new strategies. Texas\nInstruments' DLP chip may have as many a 2 millions mirrors and simple math shows\nthat testing them one by one during 1s would take approximately three weeks at 24h/day -\n\nclearly not a manageable solution. TI has thus developed a series of test that allows testing\nmirrors by group and still detect individual defect, like a sticking mirror. After testing at\nwafer level the chip are diced, put into packages and then goes through a burn-in\nprocedure. They are then tested again before being finally approved. TI noticed that\npackaging introduced new problems if the environment wasn't clean enough and they\nnow use a class 10 clean- room for the packaging of their DLP chips.\nActually, unlike the well-established and standardized IC packaging technology, MEMS\npackaging is still largely an ad-hoc development. The main efforts have been conducted\nwithin each MEMS manufacturer companies, and they have jealously kept their secret\nconsidered, with reason, as the most difficult step to bring MEMS to market. For inertial\nsensors, such as accelerometers and gyroscopes, the packaging problem is not so severe\nbecause they can be fully sealed and still probe the effects that they measure. In that case,\nthe use of stress relieving submount and a maybe a wafer-level bonded cap is all what's\nneeded to be able to use modified IC packaging procedure. However the major hurdle will\noften be that MEMS needs interfacing to the external environment. The diversity of issue\nencountered has for the moment received no standard solution and the packages are then\ndesigned case by case.\nStill, some tendencies are starting to emerge and for example sensitive component use\nfirst level packaging where a glass or silicon wafer is bonded on the chip, helping to\nmaintain the MEMS integrity during dicing and further mounting in the package.\nMoreover this may help maintain tight hermeticity by using bonding technologies with\nlimited permeability to gas, like glass to silicon anodic bonding or metal to silicon eutectic\nbond. The issue of water condensation during use just at the bad place inside the package,\nas foretold by Murphy 's Law, is what makes hermetic package a must and not only for\npressure sensor. Texas Instrument DLP's packaging is complex because the tiny mirror\nwon't survive harsh elevated temperature treatment including glass bonding. Thus a full\nindependent hermetic package in metal with a transparent glass window had to be\ndesigned, including a getter for removing the last trace of humidity. The package is sealed\nunder a dry nitrogen atmosphere with some helium to help check leaks.\nFor chemical and biological sensors, which must be exposed to liquids, the task is even\nmore complex and the package can represent as much as 90% of the final cost.\n\n4. Challenges, trends, and conclusions\n4.1. MEMS current challenges\nAlthough some products like pressure sensors have been produced for 30 years, MEMS\nindustry in many aspects is still a young industry. The heavily segmented market is\nprobably the main reason why a consortium like SEMI is still to appear for MEMS.\nHowever everybody agrees that better cooperation and planning has to happen if the cost\nof the assembly, test and packaging is to come down. MEMS can currently only look with\nenvy as IC industry seriously considers producing RFID chips for cents - including\npackaging.\nAgain the path shown by the IC industry can serve as a model, and standardization to\ninsure packaging compatibility between different MEMS chip manufacturers seems the\nway to go. Considering the smaller market size of most MEMS component, standard is\nthe only way to bring the numbers where unit packaging price is reduced substantially.\nThis implies of course automating assembly by defining standard chip handling procedure,\nand probably standard testing procedure.\nOf course, the diversity of MEMS market makes it impracticable to develop a one-fit-all\npackaging solution and the division in a few classes (inertia, gas, fluidic) is to be expected.\nFor example, several proposals for a generic solution to fluidic interfacing have been\nproposed and could become a recommendation in the future.\nIn the other hand it is not clear if standardization of MEMS fabrication process a la\nCMOS will ever happen - and is even possible. But currently most of the cost for MEMS\ncomponent happens during back-end process, thus it is by standardizing interfaces that\nmost savings can be expected.\nThe relatively long development cycle for a MEMS component is also a hurdle that needs\nto be lowered if we want more company to embrace the technology.\nOne answer lies with the MEMS designing tool providers. The possibility to do software\nverification up to the component level would certainly be a breakthrough that is now only\npossible for a limited set of cases.\nBut it is also true that the answer to proper design is not solely in the hand of better\ncomputer software but also in better training of the design engineer. In particular we hope\nthat this short introduction has shown that specific training is needed for MEMS engineers,\nwhere knowledge of mechanical and material engineering supplements electronic\nengineering. Actually, experience has often revealed that an electronic engineer with no\nunderstanding of physical aspect of MEMS is a mean MEMS designer.\n4.2. Future trend of MEMS\nLooking in the crystal ball for MEMS market has shown to be a deceptive work, but\ncurrent emerging tendencies may help foresee what will happen in the medium term.\nFrom the manufacturer point of view, a quest for lowering manufacturing cost will\nhopefully result in standardization of the MEMS interfacing as we discussed earlier, but\nfinally will lead to pursue less expensive micro-fabrication method than photolithography.\nDifferent flavors of soft-lithography are solid contenders here and micro-fluidic and\nBioMEMS are already starting to experience this change. Another possibility for reducing\ncost will be integration with electronics - but, as we already discussed, the system-on-a\nchip approach may not be optimal in many cases. Still, one likely good candidate for\nintegration will be the fabrication of a single-chip wireless communication system, using\nMEMS switch and surface high-Q component.\n\nFrom the market side, MEMS will undoubtedly invade more and more consumer products.\nThe recent use of accelerometer in cameras, handphone or in the Segway is a clear\ndemonstration of the larger applicability of the MEMS solutions - and as the prices drop,\nthis trend should increase in the future. Of course medical application can be expected to\nbe a major driver too, but here the stringent requirements make the progress slow. In the\nmid-term, before micromachines can wade in the human body to repair or measure,\nbiomedical sensors to be used by doctors or, more interesting, by patients are expected to\nbecome an important market.\nA farthest opportunity for MEMS lies probably in nanotechnology. Actually,\nnanotechnology is bringing a lot of hope - and some hype - but current fabrication\ntechniques are definitely not ready for production. MEMS will play a role by interfacing\nnano-scale with meso-scale systems, and by providing tools to produce nano-patterns at\nan affordable price.\n4.3. Conclusion\nThe MEMS industry thought it had found the killer application when at the turn of the\nmillennium 10's of startups rushed to join the fiber telecommunication bandwagon. Alas,\nthe burst of the telecommunication bubble has reminded people that in business it is not\nenough to have a product to be successful - you need customers.\nNow the industry has set more modest goals, and if the pace of development is no more\nexponential it remains solid at 2 digits, with MEMS constantly invading more and more\nmarkets. Although the MEMS business with an intrinsically segmented structure will\nmost probably never see the emergence of an Intel we can be sure that the future for\nMEMS is bright. At least because, as R. Feynman [22] stated boldly in his famous 1959\ntalk, which inspired some of the MEMS pioneers, because, indeed, \"There's plenty of\nroom at the bottom\"!\n5.

Depending on the\ncontext, mixing may refer to the concentration of a particular component or set of components\nin the fluid.\nOverview\nImportance of mixing\nA mixer is one of the basic building blocks in microfluidics, along with components such as\npumps and valves, and is a critical component in several microfluidic devices. For example,\nmixing of reaction components is essential for providing homogeneous reaction environments\nfor chemical and biological reactions. The efficiency of many devices such as biosensors\ndepends on mixing. In other applications, rapid and controlled mixing is essential for studying\nreaction kinetics with much better time resolution as compared to microscale techniques.\nMicrofluidic mixers are thus integral components essential for proper functioning of\nmicrofluidic devices for a wide range of applications.\nFundamentals of mixing\nIn the context of microfluidics, mixing is the process through which uniformity of\nconcentration is achieved. Depending on the application, the concentration may refer to\nthat of solutes (ions, small molecules, biomolecules, etc.), solvents, or suspended particles\nsuch as colloids. Microfluidics typically involves incompressible aqueous or organic\nsolutions, and we will consider only these systems here.\nMolecules in solution undergo random motions, giving rise to the process of diffusion.\nUnder a concentration gradient, diffusion results in flux (J) of molecules that tends to\nhomogenize the concentration (c) of that molecular species.\nJ = -D∇c\n\n(1)\n\nHere D is diffusivity of the species under consideration, and varies from approximately 10\n9 m2/s for small molecules and ions to 10-11 m2/s for large biomolecules. Therefore, an\nisolated system with non-uniform concentrations ultimately achieves a state of uniform\nconcentration, i.e. it will be completely mixed. The mixing time depends on the diffusivity\n(D) and length scale over which diffusion must act in order to homogenize the\nconcentration, known as the striation length (lst). The mixing time is then given by\n2lst\ntmix ~\n\n(2)\n\nD\n\nFrom this equation, it is clearly seen that for rapid mixing, it is necessary to reduce the\nstriation length (Figure 1). This concept leads to two ideas intimately connected with the\nprocess of mixing: (a) the process of decreasing the distance over which diffusion must act,\nand (b) the process of diffusion itself. The former process of decreasing the striation length\nis accomplished by stretching and folding of the fluid or by breakup and rejoining. These\nprocesses decrease striation length and increase the area across which diffusion takes\nplace, thus enabling diffusion to rapidly homogenize the solution.\ntime\nlst\nlst\n(a)\n(b)\ntime\nlst\nlst\ntime\nlst\nlst\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure 1. Striation length (lst) and mixing time. The striation length characterizes the distance over which\ndiffusion must act in order to homogenize the solution. (a) An unmixed solution with a large striation length\ntakes time to mix by diffusion alone. (b) A 5-fold reduction in the striation length decreases the mixing time\n25-fold.\nMathematically, the concept of mixing is rather unwieldy, and is built upon the concepts of\nergodicity and dynamical systems theory. The reader is referred to Wiggins and Ottino [1]\nfor an introduction to the mathematical treatment of mixing, and to Ottino [2] for a\ncomprehensive treatment. Here we describe two types of flows or transformations with a\nmathematical basis that aid in understanding and designing mixers: The Baker's\ntransformation is useful for understanding mixing involving the process of breakup, and\nblinking flows are useful for understanding the process of mixing in designs that do not\ninvolve breakup.\nConsider a rectangular domain, with half of the domain marked with black points (Figure\n2a). The Baker's transformation consists of stretching, cutting, and rejoining such that the\nstriation length decreases uniformly everywhere in the domain. In the first step, the domain\nis stretched uniformly in one direction. In the second step, the domain is cut and rejoined.\nThe striation length decreases by a factor of two each time the transformation is applied,\ntherefore an exponential decrease in the striation length is achieved (Figure 2b). Mixing\nachieved in this transformation satisfies the strongest mathematical definition of mixing\nand is therefore highly desirable [1]. The Baker's transformation illustrates how the\nprocess of breakup can be used to exponentially decrease the striation length, and is useful\nfor designing systems where fluid streams or droplets split and rejoin.\nIn a seminal paper in 1984, Aref [3] pointed out that simple time-varying two-dimensional\nflows can result in non-integrable particle trajectories, beautifully illustrated in the book by\nOttino [2] (Figure 2c). This concept was the starting point of what is now widely called chaotic\nadvection. While chaotic advection is not precisely defined, it is associated with exponential\nstretching and folding of the fluid. Aref considered mixing in an idealized bounded two-\ndimensional domain with blinking flows. Blinking flows switch instantaneously from one\n\notic advection in blinking flows\n+\n\nstreamline pattern to another in a periodic fashion. The relevance of this idealized concept to\ncontinuous-flow mixing in microfluidics is that flows transverse to the primary flow direction\ncan be made to switch between two patterns as the fluid travels along the channel. Thus, a\nthree-dimensional steady flow with periodicity in space may be understood in terms of a two-\ndimensional blinking flow with periodicity in time. An intuitive design criterion for such flows\nis that effective mixing corresponds to maximum crossing of streamlines of the two flows of\nthe blinking flow. The mathematical basis of this design criterion is the linked twist map,\ndescribed by Wiggins and Ottino [1]. Proper design of mixers incorporating the principles of\nchaotic advection can result in striation lengths that exponentially decrease in time.\nRejoin\n(b) Successive application of Baker's transformation\nStretch\nCut\n(a) Baker's transformation\nFlow pattern 1\nFlow pattern 2\nBlinking flow\n(c) Cha\n+\n=\n=\n(b) Successive application of Baker's transformation\nStretch\nCut\n(a) Baker's transformation\nFlow pattern 1\nFlow pattern 2\nBlinking flow\n(c) Chaotic advection in blinking flows\n+\n+\n=\n=\nFigure 2.

While each flow pattern exhibits simple streamlines and particle trajectories, the\nblinking flow itself exhibits chaotic advection and non-integrable particle trajectories.

The small length scale leads to different physical phenomena being\ndominant at the microscale: First, inertial effects that typically result in turbulence and good\nmixing on the macroscale are weak in microfluidics, while methods of actuation based on\nelectrokinetics, surface tension or other phenomena that are not relevant on the macroscale\nbecome feasible on the microscale. Secondly, many mechanical designs such as stirrers that\ncan be easily implemented on the macroscale are very difficult to implement on the\nmicroscale. A useful mixer is therefore often the one that is simple to fabricate and integrate\nwith other microfluidic components.\nThe Reynolds number (Re) characterizes the relative importance of inertial to viscous forces,\nand is given by\n\nρUl\nRe\n\n=\n\n(3)\n\nη\nHere ρ is the density, U is flow velocity, l is the characteristic length scale (e.g., channel\nheight), and η is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid.\nIn macroscale systems, the effect of inertia is often significant, resulting in a large Re and\nturbulence, which can be harnessed for mixing. However, due to the small channel size (l),\nmicrofluidic flows are characterized by a low Reynolds number, typically in the range of 0.01\nto 100, and the effects of inertia are often negligible. Turbulence is therefore typically not\nencountered and microfluidic flows are usually laminar. Mixing due to diffusion alone is also\nnot sufficient for rapid mixing in microfluidics. For example, a small molecule with a\ndiffusivity of 10-9 m2/s will take approximately 10 s to diffuse across a 100 μm microchannel,\nwhile a large macromolecule with a diffusivity of 10-11 m2/s will require about 1000 s.\nThe Peclet number (Pe), a dimensionless number that characterizes the relative importance of\ndiffusion to convection, is often used in the context of mixing of continuously flowing streams.\nThe Peclet number is given by\nl 2 D\ntdiff\nlU\nPe =\n=\n=\n\n(4)\n\nl U\nτ conv\nD\nHere D is diffusivity, l is the characteristic length scale (typically channel height) and U is the\nflow velocity. The Peclet number can thus be viewed as the ratio of characteristic time for\ndiffusion (tdiff) to the characteristic convection time (τconv). When mixing occurs only via\ndiffusion in a microchannel, tmix = tdiff = τ convPe . The channel length required for mixing (lmix)\nis then given by\nl\n= Ut\n= lPe\n\n(5)\n\nmix\nmix\nA linear relationship between the mixing time and the Peclet number implies that the channel\nlength needed for mixing increases linearly as the flow velocity is increased, or as the\ndiffusivity is decreased (for different species). In order to minimize the channel length required\nfor mixing, it is desirable to design mixers in which the mixing time increases only weakly\nwith the Peclet number. For a microchannel with l = 100 μm, the Peclet number is 1000 for\ndiffusivity (D) of 10-9 m2/s (typical of small molecules) and flow speed of 1 mm/s. If mixing\noccurs purely due to diffusion, the channel length must be 1000 times the channel height for\ntwo streams to mix in the channel, i.e. the channel length must be 10 cm. However, if larger\nbiomolecules with a diffusivity of 10-11 m2/s are to be mixed, the required channel length\nincreases 100-fold to 10 m!\nClearly, in the absence of turbulence, other methods of microfluidic mixing must be\ndevised. Since mixing ultimately occurs by diffusion, the goal of all mixers must be to\ndecrease the striation length across which diffusion takes place in order to mix more\nefficiently.\nMixer Performance\nThe criteria used to measure mixing vary widely. One of the more common measures for\nmixing known as the mixing variance coefficient (MVC) [4] is based on the concentration\ndistribution inside the channel or volume. For this purpose, the volume under consideration\nis divided into sub-volumes, and the deviation of concentrations in each sub-volume from\nthe average concentration in the volume is computed as follows:\n\nMVC = ∑(ci - cavg )\n\n(6)\n\nN\nHere N is the number of sub-domains, ci is the concentration in the ith sub-domain, and cavg\nis the average concentration for the entire domain. MVC approaches zero when mixing is\ncomplete. Division of the domain into sub-domains for computing the MVC is shown in\nFigure 4a.\nExperimentally, a commonly used method for characterizing mixing uses chemical\nreactions with fast kinetics. Such reactions may include reactions such as ion-binding\nfluorescent dyes that change fluorescence intensity upon binding the ion or pH indicators\nthat change color. However, it must be noted that mixing characterized using these\nmethods depends on reactant concentrations as well as diffusivities. Therefore, care must\nbe exercised when attempting to evaluate mixing of the molecular species of interest using\nother species as indicators.\nThe criteria for evaluating the performance of microfluidic mixers vary widely depending\non the application. However, for many applications, the most important criterion that\ndetermines the usefulness of the mixer is ease of fabrication. Mixers that can be easily\nincorporated with other microfluidic components are more likely to be used than those that\nrequire special fabrication procedures. Active mixers are generally more difficult to\nfabricate than passive mixers, and therefore find use only in certain applications. Apart\nfrom ease of fabrication, different applications may have different requirements that may\nbe used to judge the performance of the mixer. Applications such as study of reaction\nkinetics demand rapid mixing and ease of observation of the ensuing reaction. Here, the\nprimary consideration is usually mixing time. For combinatorial synthesis or other\napplications, it may be necessary to have a small space footprint and ease of integration\nwith other components. In certain cases, pressure drop in the mixer may be important.\nKey Research Findings\nMixer classification\nMixers are broadly classified as active or passive mixers based on the method of actuation.\nActive mixers employ \"active\" elements such as external pressure perturbations, small\nactuators, or other methods in addition to the applied pressure that drives flow. Passive mixers\nrely solely on the pressure gradient (or other mechanisms such as electroosmosis) that drives\nthe flow in combination with \"passive\" elements such as channel geometry or other properties\nin order to achieve mixing. Note that the definition of passive mixers applies only to\ncontinuous flow systems, and mixers that mix stationary and bounded volumes of fluid are\ntypically active mixers. Some passive mixers may operate at moderate Reynolds numbers and\nuse inertial effects for mixing, while others use channel geometry or other effects to mix\neffectively at low Reynolds numbers. Typically, passive mixers are easy to fabricate and more\nrobust than active mixers, and are therefore more widely used by researchers. Other methods\nof classification may be based on the physical phenomena driving the flow (electrokinetics,\nmagnetohydrodynamics, ultrasound, inertia, etc.), single phase or multi-phase flows,\nfabrication complexity, continuous flow versus discrete volumes, etc. The following sections\nclassify mixers as active/passive and further based on flow patterns, and other classifications\nare either self-evident or pointed out in specific cases of interest.\n\nPassive Mixers\nPassive mixers may be broadly classified as focusing/injection mixers, lamination mixers,\nand chaotic advection mixers. Focusing/injection mixers rely on diffusion alone to cause\nmixing. These mixers are effective if one stream with a small flow rate is to be diluted into\nanother stream with a large flow rate. Lamination mixers typically split the streams to be\nmixed into multiple streams that are then interdigitated and brought together. Splitting into\nseveral streams decreases the striation length and therefore enhances mixing. In these\ncases, the striation length remains fixed during the process of mixing, and mixing time is\napproximately independent of the flow rate. Chaotic advection mixers, on the other hand,\ncause exponential thinning of the striation length. Achieving chaotic flows in passive\nmicrofluidic mixers typically requires three-dimensional channel geometry, use of weak\ninertial effects, or two-phase flows.\n(a) Hydrodynamic flow focusing\n\nl\nWf\nInlet\n\n(d) Staggered herringbone\n\nmixer\n(b) Parallel lamination\nTwo parallel\nstreams\nMultiple parallel\nstreams\n\nDirection of flow\n\n(e) Plug serpentine\n\nmixer\n\n(c) Cross\n\nflow mixer incorporating splitting and recombination\nFigure 3.

Inset cartoon depicts alternating flow patterns inside individual plugs as\nthey traverse through the channel. Reproduced from Song et al. [8] with permission of Wiley Interscience.\nFocusing/Injection Mixers\nFocusing or injection mixers are not true mixers; rather, they are very efficient at diluting\none stream in another. In the hydrodynamic focusing mixer, three streams converge and\nflow into one microfluidic channel. Figure 2a shows a cartoon of the hydrodynamic\nfocusing mixer reported by Knight et al. [5]. The inlet stream can be focused into a very\nthin stream by the adjoining side streams, either by controlling pressures of the three\n\nstreams or by controlling the flow rates of each stream using a syringe pump. Sub-micron\nfocusing of the inlet stream enables species from the side streams to rapidly diffuse into the\nfocused stream. Homogeneity of concentration is achieved as far as species in the\nadjoining streams are concerned. However, species in the focused stream take much longer\nto distribute uniformly across the channel cross section. Mixing time in this mixer depends\nonly upon the width (wf) of the central focused stream, which defines the striation length in\nthis case:\nw f\nw f\ntmix ~ D =\nl τ convPe\n\n(7)\n\nIt is seen that mixing time scales linearly with the Peclet number. However, the mixing\ntime is decreased dramatically since wf << l. For D = 10-9 m2/s (typical of small molecules\nor ions) and wf = 100 nm, the mixing time is only 10 μs. This mixer is a very effective tool\nfor rapidly changing the chemical environment of species in the central focused stream, at\nthe same time consuming a smaller sample due to the low flow rate of the inlet stream.\nHydrodynamic focusing mixers find applications in the study of fast kinetics such as\nprotein folding.\nInjection mixers are similar to flow focusing mixers in that they also dilute one stream into\nanother stream; however they differ from focusing mixers in that a small aperture is used\nto inject a thin stream into another stream. These mixers enable multiple flow streams to be\ninjected, and may be more desirable when flow rates or pressures cannot be controlled.\nMixing time depends on the method of injection and device geometry. However,\nconstruction of small apertures or the use of a membrane with apertures is required,\nmaking injection mixers harder to fabricate compared with focusing mixers.\nLamination mixers\nLamination mixers employ parallel lamina across which diffusion can take place. The simplest\nmixer is the classic T-mixer that brings together two fluid streams and allows diffusive mixing\nas they flow parallel in a channel. In the absence of turbulence, the effective striation length is\nof the order of the channel size. Therefore, the mixing time in this case is given by\nl 2\ntmix ~\n= τ convPe\n\n(8)\n\nD\nMixing time scales linearly with the Peclet number, and mixing time is equal to the\ncharacteristic time for diffusion across the channel cross-section. This mixer requires long\nmixing times, but is very simple to implement and hence becomes a practical multi-purpose\nmixer in cases where there are no severe demands on mixing time and channel length. An\nimprovement over the T-mixer is the parallel lamination mixer (Figure 2b). This mixer splits\nthe streams to be mixed into multiple streams, which are interdigitated and recombined. If each\nstream is split into N streams, the striation length is decreased by a factor of N and mixing time\nis consequently decreased by a factor of N2.\n(l N )2\nτ conv Pe\nmix\n=\n\n(9)\n\nt\n~\nD\nN\nFor example, with D = 10-9 m2/s, l = 100 μm, and N = 10, the mixing time decreases from\napproximately 10 seconds to just 100 ms, and the channel length required for mixing also\ndecreases by two orders of magnitude. This mixer is therefore more effective than the T-mixer,\neven though mixing time scales linearly with the Peclet number. However, interdigitation\ninvolves crossing over of channels, requiring a two-level fluidic architecture that is harder to\nfabricate than the single-level fluidic architecture of the T-mixer.\n\nPassive chaotic advection mixers\nProper design of mixers incorporating the principles of chaotic advection can result in striation\nlengths that exponentially decrease in time. Since steady two-dimensional flows cannot exhibit\nchaotic advection [1], passive chaotic advection mixers need either three-dimensional\ngeometries or use of weak inertial effects in order to achieve chaotic advection. Alternatively,\nflow in the third dimension can be imparted using two-phase flows in channels with two-\ndimensional geometries (i.e. obtained by extrusion of a two-dimensional pattern). Continuous\nflow chaotic advection mixers usually consist of repeating units that perform stretching and\nfolding or breakup and rejoining operations in each unit. After each unit, the striation length\ndecreases by a constant factor (e.g. by a factor of 2), and exponential decrease in the striation\nlength is achieved as the fluid stream traverses multiple units. The mixing length scales only as\nthe logarithm of the Peclet number, making chaotic advection mixers highly effective in\nmixing at high Peclet numbers (low diffusivity or high velocity). For example, consider a\nmixer in which the striation length decreases by a factor of two after every unit. If τconv is the\ntime required to traverse one unit of the mixer,\n2-t /τ conv\nlst = l\n\n(10)\n\nMixing may be said to be complete when the time required for diffusion across the striation\nlength equals the time required to traverse one unit of the mixer [6].\n2lst ~ τ conv\n\n(11)\n\nD\nThe mixing time and mixing length are then given as follows:\n2lst ~ τ conv\nD\ntmix ~ τ conv log Pe\n\n(12)\n\nlmix ~ l log Pe\nIt is thus seen that mixing time now scales logarithmically with the Peclet number instead of\nlinearly as in the case of the T-mixer or flow focusing mixer.\nLow Reynolds number chaotic advection mixers\nMicrofluidic mixers can be designed to mix using the principles of chaotic advection even in\nthe purely viscous flow regime. Xia et al. [7] reported a mixer that splits, reorients and\nrecombines flows using crossing channels (Figure 3c). While several mixers with three-\ndimensional geometries mix flows at intermediate Reynolds numbers, this mixer is one of the\nfew mixers that can mix in the regime of purely viscous flow. The three-dimensional\narchitecture is essential for reorienting the fluid elements before recombination. The mixer was\nfabricated using two-level microchannels using PDMS, a silicone polymer commonly used for\nfabrication of microfluidic devices. Good mixing was possible at very small Reynolds\nnumbers down to 0.01.\nStroock et al. [8] reported a staggered herringbone mixer that uses grooves on channel walls to\ndrive transverse flows. An asymmetric herringbone groove structure results in two asymmetric\ncirculating flows in the channel. Circulating flows that alternate periodically along the channel\n\nare established by alternating the herringbone pattern (Figure 3d). Effectively, it results in a\ntime-dependent two-dimensional blinking flow with intersecting streamlines, resulting in\nchaotic advection. In this mixer, the mixing length was shown to scale logarithmically with\nPeclet number over a range of 6 orders of magnitude of the Peclet number. Unlike other\nchaotic advection mixers that require a two-level fluid architecture, this mixer only requires\ngrooves on the substrate, greatly simplifying the fabrication process. This mixer has therefore\nfound wide application in microfluidics.\nTwo-phase flow mixers\nThree-dimensional geometries are inherently more difficult to fabricate than two-dimensional\nchannel geometries. However, steady two-dimensional viscous flows are inherently integrable,\nand chaotic advection is not possible. Two-phase flows overcome this obstacle by introducing\ncirculating flows inside fluid segments or droplets, which can be used to convert the inherently\ntwo-dimensional flows to three-dimensional chaotic flows under suitable conditions. The\nserpentine mixer reported by Song et al. [9] is the most prominent mixer in this category\n(Figure 3e). This mixer consists of a wiggly serpentine channel in which droplets of one phase\n(usually aqueous) flow in another continuous phase (usually oil). When the droplets occupy\nnearly the entire channel cross-section, they are termed as plugs. As a plug traverses a\nserpentine channel, the flow inside each plug alternates between two flow patterns with\ncrossing streamlines. This flow pattern results in chaotic advection and rapid mixing. The\nsame principle can be applied to mix liquid segments separated by gas bubbles. Millisecond\nmixing timescales are possible with this mixer, and sub-millisecond timescale kinetics can be\nprobed, making the it one of the fastest mixers for mixing fluid streams in any given flow\nratio. While increasing flow speed can decrease mixing time, this mixer is limited by break-up\nof the plugs/fluid segments that occurs at high flow speeds. In order to sustain plug flows\nwithout breakup of the plug or bubble, surface tension (γ) must be sufficiently large compared\nto shear forces. This phenomenon is characterized by the Capillary number:\nηlU\nCa =\n\n(13)\n\nγ\nFor Ca>1, plugs may be sheared into smaller droplets that destroy proper flow in the mixer.\nTwo-phase mixers are well-suited for studying reaction kinetics because each plug or fluid\nsegment acts as an individual reactor, and there is no dispersion along the flow direction. With\nincreasing use of two-phase systems, this mixer has found wide application in areas ranging\nfrom chemical synthesis to biochemistry.\nIntermediate Reynolds number mixers based on weak inertial effects\nWhile turbulence sets in at Reynolds numbers greater than about 2300, even at low Reynolds\nnumbers inertial effects can induce transverse flows that impart three-dimensionality to a flow\nthat is otherwise two-dimensional at lower Reynolds numbers. At still higher Reynolds\nnumbers, inertial effects can produce flow separation, vortex formation, and vortex shedding.\nThese effects can be harnessed for mixing, and proper design can even lead to chaotic\nadvection at intermediate Reynolds numbers. The simplest mixer in this category is the\nserpentine mixer that consists of a zigzag channel. Sharp bends in the mixer create cross-flows\nthat enhance mixing. Mixing is due to diffusion alone at Reynolds numbers below about 80,\nand it improves at higher Reynolds numbers [5]. Another class of mixers based on Tesla\nstructures employ in-plane splitting and recombination of streams and can mix at Re>5 [5].\nLiu et al. [5] reported a three-dimensional serpentine mixer that uses C-shaped segments. The\ndevice has two fluidic layers, and was fabricated in silicon and glass. Chaotic advection was\nfound to occur at Reynolds numbers higher than 20. Mixers operating at intermediate to high\nReynolds numbers are especially useful when comparatively high flow rates are required, such\n\nas in chemical synthesis. However, these mixers are typically not used for biological\napplications, where the samples are usually smaller and more expensive.\nMixers based on other instabilities\nMixing in turbulent flows that occur at high Reynolds numbers is an illustration of mixing due\nto instability induced in the flow by inertial effects. Similarly, other phenomena may lead to\ninstabilities in microfluidic flows and may be harnessed for mixing. The only known examples\nof mixing using other instabilities are the electrokinetic instability mixer and the viscoelastic\ninstability mixer [6]. The electrokinetic instability mixer uses instabilities induced in the\ncharged region at the junction of two fluid streams with differing ionic compositions when an\nelectric field is applied parallel to the junction. The viscoelastic intability mixer exploits non-\nNewtonian fluid properties in order to achieve mixing.\nActive Mixers\nIn addition to pressure gradients and inertial effects, several other mechanisms can be used to\ndrive fluid flow for mixing. These mechanisms can range from simple pressure disturbances to\nmore complicated systems utilizing miniature actuators.\n(a) Shear\n\nsuperposition mixer\n\n(c) Rotary mixer\n\n(b) Mixer based\n\non\n\nAC electroosmosis\n\nFigure 4.

(c) A\nrotary mixer uses pumps to drive flow in a circular microchannel. Algebraic stretching of the fluid results in a\nrapid decrease in the striation length (heff) and thus enables mixing. Reproduced from Squires et al. [9] with\npermission of the American Physical Society.\n\nPressure/velocity field disturbance mixers\nThese mixers rely on external pressure or velocity disturbances to change the flow pattern\ninside the channel and thereby enable faster mixing. Bottausci et al. [4] reported a shear\nsuperposition mixer that employs actuating side channels that are perpendicular to the main\nchannel (Figure 4a). An oscillating pressure or velocity disturbance in these channels affects\nflow in the main channel and causes mixing. With the correct choice of driving frequencies\nand amplitudes in the side channels, it is possible to induce chaotic advection and rapid\nmixing. Another simple design is a modification of the T-mixer. Instead of a steady flow in the\ntwo input channels, the driving pressure or flow rates are oscillated so that the mixing channel\nreceives alternating longitudinal bands of fluid from each input channel. The parabolic flow\nthen stretches these bands, algebraically decreasing the striation length and enabling faster\nmixing.\nRotary mixer\nRotary mixers [6] are very useful in integrated microfluidics, pioneered by the group of\nStephen Quake. This microfluidic architecture uses a control layer of fluidic channels that can\nsqueeze an underlying layer of channels, just as stepping on a garden hose clamps it shut. The\noperation of such elements requires a flexible material such as PDMS for device fabrication. A\nsingle element can function as a valve, and three elements operating together can function as a\npump. With this basic design of externally actuated valves and pumps, it is possible to perform\ncomplex multiplexed fluidic manipulation. The mixer works by driving fluid flow in a circular\nmicrochannel using a pump. Fluid volumes to be mixed are first metered into the circular\nchannel, forming bands shaped like arcs in the circular microchannel. Driving fluid flow\naround the circular channel results in linear stretching of the fluid inside the channel and the\nstriation length decreases algebraically with time. Complete mixing can be achieved within\none second. Rotary mixers are useful in such architectures for mixing metered volumes of\nfluid in a serial fashion or for continuous stirring in confined volumes, and have found\napplications in chemical synthesis and combinatorial screening.\nInduced field electroosmosis mixers\nInduced field electroosmosis (sometimes known as AC electroosmosis) is electroosmotic flow\ngenerated under AC excitation in an electrolyte solution due to tangential migration of induced\ncharges at the electrode-solution interface. This method is relatively simple for driving fluid\nflow because it does not involve any moving parts and planar electrodes can be easily\nfabricated using conventional lithographic techniques. Sasaki et al. [10] demonstrated one such\nmixer that involves asymmetric patterned electrodes inside a mixing microchannel. AC\nelectroosmosis drives asymmetric circulating flow that results in rapid mixing. Mixing was\nobserved to occur in 0.18 s, approximately independent of the flow velocity and 20 times\nfaster than that in the absence of AC electroosmosis. While this mixer was not designed for\nchaotic advection, induced field electroosmosis offers a wide variety of design possibilities by\nchanging the device geometry. The main drawback of induced field electroosmosis is that it is\nsensitive to the presence of buffers and biomolecules in the solution.\nOther types of mixers\nApart from the methods described above, there are several different ways in which\nmicrofluidic flows can be driven [5]. Several of these methods have been used for microfluidic\nmixing including dielectrophoresis (migration of polarizable particles under an electric field\ngradient), electrokinetics (fluid flow driven by migration of charges at microchannel surfaces\nunder an electric field along the channel), acoustic actuation, thermally generated bubbles,\nmagnetohydrodynamics (flow in a current-carrying fluid in a magnetic field induced by\n\nLorentz forces) among others. Most of these mixers are highly specialized and do not find\nbroad applications.\nFuture Directions for Research\nRecent years have seen rapid progress in application of the theory of mixing as well as in\nthe innovative design of new microfluidic mixers. The design space available for\ninnovation in this field is vast, and new mixers are constantly being developed. The\nmathematical foundations of mixing are being used to optimize the design of mixers.\nTheorists have developed models and guidelines for mixer design that can be easily\nadapted by researchers who use microfluidic mixers, but are typically not involved in the\ntheory of mixing. In the future, we may see innovative mixer designs that are effective yet\neasy to implement, and rest on the mathematical foundations of mixing.\nCross-references\nActive Mixing\nBrowning Motion and Diffusion\nChaotic Flow\nChaotic Mixing Based on Viscoelasticity\nCompute Mixing Efficiency\nCurved Microchannel Flow\nDroplet Based Lab-on-chip Devices\nPassive Mixing\nFurther Reading\n1.\nWiggins S, Ottino JM Foundations of chaotic mixing (2004) Philosophical Transactions of the\nRoyal Society of London Series A-Mathematical Physical and Engineering Sciences 362(1818):\n937-970\n2.\nOttino JM (1997) The kinematics of mixing: stretching, chaos and transport.
