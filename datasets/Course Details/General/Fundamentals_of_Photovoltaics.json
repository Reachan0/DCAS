  "syllabus_content": "Class Meeting Times\n\nLectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session\n\nRecitations: 1 session / week, 1 hour / session\n\nSynopsis\n\nIn this course, you will learn about the fundamentals of photoelectric conversion: charge excitation, conduction, separation, and collection. You will become familiar with commercial and emerging photovoltaic (PV) technologies and various cross-cutting themes in PV: conversion efficiencies, loss mechanisms, characterization, manufacturing, systems, reliability, life-cycle analysis, and risk analysis. Other topics covered include photovoltaic technology evolution in the context of markets, policies, society, and environment.\n\nCourse Objectives\n\nBy the year 2030, several hundred gigawatts of power must be generated from low-carbon sources to cap atmospheric CO\nconcentrations at levels deemed \"lower-risk\" by the current scientific consensus. The necessity to develop low-carbon energy sources represents not only an awesome technological and engineering challenge, but also an equally large economic opportunity in a trillion-dollar energy market.\n\nStudents will learn how solar cells convert light into electricity, how solar cells are manufactured, how solar cells are evaluated, what technologies are currently on the market, and how to evaluate the risk and potential of existing and emerging solar cell technologies. We examine the potential & drawbacks of currently manufactured technologies (single- and multicrystalline silicon, CdTe, CIGS, CPV), as well as pre-commercial technologies (organics, biomimetic, organic / inorganic hybrid, and nanostructure-based solar cells). Hands-on laboratory sessions explore how a solar cell works in practice. We will learn how to enhance solar cell performance and reduce cost, and the major hurdles-technological, economic, and political-towards widespread adoption. Students will apply this knowledge towards developing a class project on the solar-related topic of their choosing.\n\nCourse Learning Objectives\n\nDescribe (phenomenologically) the principal phenomena governing the function (and conversion efficiency) of a PV device.\n\nList currently commercialized technologies, and list strengths, weaknesses of each, and develop a cost model.\n\nIdentify limitations to terrawatt-scale deployment, and possible enabling strategies and technologies.\n\nApply the above to a real-world project, evaluating complex trade-offs between technology, economics, policy, and social aspects.\n\nCourse Structure\n\nThe course is divided into three parts: Fundamentals, Technologies, and Cross-Cutting Themes. This structure is represented by the following figure and reflected in the course\ncalendar\n.\n\nFor the first half of the term, the course will operate in a \"flipped classroom\" mode. For lectures 2 to 12, before each class period, you will watch the assigned MIT OpenCourseWare video lecture recorded during the Fall 2011 term. Our class meetings will be devoted to further discussion and in-class activities.\n\nGoogle+ Community\n\nWhen this course was taught at MIT, it used a\nGoogle+ Community\nto keep alumni in touch with current students.\n\nGrading\n\nACTIVITIES\n\n% of FINAL GRADES\n\nConcept Quizzes\n\n15%\n\nHomework\n\n10%\n\nClassroom, field trip, and Google community participation\n\n10%\n\nManufacturing line challenge\n\n10%\n\nQuiz 1\n\n10%\n\nQuiz 2\n\n15%\n\nTeam Project\n\n30%\n\nStudent-Professor Contract\n\nI recognize there are many students coming from a diverse range of backgrounds and academic levels. My objective is to make the course as meaningful and interesting as possible, and as challenging as appropriate, without leaving folks behind or causing more experienced students to get bored. While teaching domain-specific knowledge, I intend to convey an approach one can employ towards\nany\nmultidisciplinary field in which technology, policy, and economics are closely entwined. This professional skill is highly transferable to other industries and problems.\n\nIn turn, I expect each student to do her / his part: attend and participate in lectures, labs, and field trips; actively read materials\nbefore\nclass; attend TA's and Professor's office hours\nbefore\nyou start falling behind, and pick a project about which you're passionate. I expect complete adherence to MIT's code of academic conduct.\n\nStaffing\n\nThis class is primarily taught by Prof. Tonio Buonassisi and with TAs Stephanie Scott and Dr. Tim Kirkpatrick. Other members of the\nMIT PVLab\noccasionally teach labs and deep dive tutorials.\n\nProf. Buonassisi's research is focused on bringing photovoltaics mainstream via technology innovations. Prior to joining the faculty at MIT, Prof. Buonassisi worked at a local solar energy start-up (Evergreen Solar, Inc.), and he continues to interact with a wide range of companies today. Buonassisi co-developed a similar semester-long course on photovoltaics at UC Berkeley, and month-long mini-courses during the MIT IAP periods of 2006 and 2007, which attracted over fifty participants across various disciplines. For more information about Buonassisi and the PVLab, see the\nPVLab website\n.\n\nStephanie is a second-year graduate student in Mechanical Engineering. Her research focuses on modeling impurity evolution during high-temperature processing in silicon-based photovoltaic materials. Stephanie received a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from the University of California at Berkeley in 2012.\n\nDr. Tim Kirkpatrick's research interests are in the device physics of non-planar photovoltaic junctions. He joined the PVLab in September 2012 and is researching ways of increasing power conversion efficiency of thin film silicon solar cells through material processing and junction design. He completed his PhD in condensed matter physics at Boston College in August 2012.\n\nVisiting lecturers may be drawn from surrounding companies, universities, analyst, consulting, and venture capital firms, as well as all segments of the PV value chain (wafer, cell, and module manufacturing, installation, systems integration).\n\nTextbook\n\nHonsberg, C., and S.

Normalizing for geometry makes it easier to\ncompare the performance of two or more devices of\nsimilar semiconductor materials but different sizes.\n- The variable \"I\" is typically used to represent \"current\",\nwhile the variable \"J\" represents \"current density\". Thus,\nyou may well see \"JV curves\" reported in the literature.\n\nBuonassisi (MIT) 2011\nKey Concept:\n\n\"Conversion efficiency\" of a solar cell device can be determined\nby measuring the IV curve. Just three IV-curve parameters are\nneeded to calculate conversion efficiency: Short-circuit current\ndensity (Jsc, the maximum current density of the device in short-\ncircuit conditions), open-circuit voltage (Voc, the maximum\nvoltage produced by the device, when the two terminals are not\nconnected), and fill factor (ratio of \"maximum power\" to the\nJsc*Voc product).\n\nBuonassisi (MIT) 2011\nJ Jo eqV /kT 1\n\nJL\nEfficiency Calculations\nCurrent Density (J)\nIlluminated JV Curve\n\nBuonassisi (MIT) 2011\nEfficiency Calculations\nVoc\nJsc\nMPP\nIlluminated JV Curve\nCurrent Density (J)\nJ Jo eqV /kT 1\n\nJL\n\nBuonassisi (MIT) 2011\nEfficiency Calculations\nVoc\nJsc\nMPP\nOpen-circuit\nvoltage (maximum\nvoltage, zero\ncurrent, zero\npower)\nMaximum Power\nPoint (maximum\npower, i.e., current-\nvoltage product)\nJ Jo eqV /kT 1\n\nJL\nIlluminated JV Curve\nCurrent Density (J)\nShort-circuit\ncurrent (maximum\ncurrent, zero\nvoltage, zero\npower)\n\nBuonassisi (MIT) 2011\nVoc\nJsc\nMPP Power Density\nCurrent Density\nIndustry Convention: Quadrant flipped!\nEfficiency Calculations\nIlluminated JV Curve\nCurrent Density (mA/cm2)\nPower Density (mW/cm2)\n\nBuonassisi (MIT) 2011\nEfficiency Calculations\nVoc\nJsc\nMPP Power Density\nCurrent Density\nEfficiency Power Out\nPower In VmpJmp\n\nCurrent Density (mA/cm2)\nPower Density (mW/cm2)\nIlluminated JV Curve\n\nBuonassisi (MIT) 2011\nEfficiency Calculations\nVoc\nJsc\nMPP Power Density\nCurrent Density\nEfficiency Power Out\nPower In VmpJmpA\n\nSunlight (Input)\nSolar Cell\nOutput Power\nat MPP\nCurrent Density (mA/cm2)\nPower Density (mW/cm2)\nIlluminated JV Curve\n\nBuonassisi (MIT) 2011\nEfficiency Calculations\nMPP Power\nFill Factor FF VmpJmp\nVocJsc\nJmp*Vmp\nJsc*Voc\nIlluminated JV Curve\nCurrent Density (mA/cm2)\nPower Density (mW/cm2)\n\nBuonassisi (MIT) 2011\nEfficiency Calculations\nMPP Power\nFill Factor FF VmpJmp\nVocJsc\nJmp*Vmp\nJsc*Voc\nRatio of areas\nof two boxes,\ndefined by\nJscxVoc, and\nJmpxVmp.\nIlluminated JV Curve\nCurrent Density (mA/cm2)\nPower Density (mW/cm2)\n\nBuonassisi (MIT) 2011\nEfficiency Power Out\nPower In VmpImp\n\nFill Factor FF VmpImp\nVocIsc\nVmpJmp\nVocJsc\nEfficiency Calculations\nBy combining equations 1 and 2...\nWe obtain:\nEfficiency Power Out\nPower In VmpImp\n\nFFVocIsc\n\nBuonassisi (MIT) 2011\nWhy does Efficiency matter?\n\nBuonassisi (MIT) 2011\nKey Concept:\n\n\"Conversion efficiency\" effectively determines the area of solar\ncollectors needed to produce a given amount of power.\n\nSince many costs scale with area (e.g., glass, encapsulants,\nlabor, mounting, framing... pretty much everything but the\ninverter), increasing conversion efficiency is a highly leveraged\nway to reduce the cost of solar.\n\nBuonassisi (MIT) 2011\nThe Area Needed to Produce A Certain Amount of Power\nScales with Efficiency\n100% efficiency\n(impossible to achieve)\n33% efficiency\n(space-grade solar cells)\n20% efficiency\n(monocrystalline\nsilicon solar cells)\n10% efficiency\n(thin film material)\nVery\nExpensive\nmaterial\nExpensive\nmaterial\nRelatively Inexpensive material\n\nBuonassisi (MIT) 2011\nThe Cost of Materials (Glass, Encapsulants...)

The solar resource is abundant.\n3. The solar resource distribution is well matched to growing human\nenergy demand.\n4. Solar is renewable, and is a 5-10x lower-carbon energy source than\nfossil fuels. [1]\nHow Solar?\n1. Solar is on a rapid path to convergence with conventional fossil-fuel-\nbased energy sources, both in cost and scale.\n2. Many challenges inhibiting wide-scale solar adoption are identified.\n3. Solutions to these challenges are rooted in PV technology,\nmanufacturing, and deployment innovations.\n4. To train future leaders to develop these solutions, a solid fundamental\nunderstanding of the science, technology, and cross-cutting themes is\nnecessary.\n[1] V.M.

      "content": "Team\nVendor Name\nWafer Recipe Code Name\nPrice ($/100pcs)\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\nManufacturing Science/Engineering of Solar Cells\nAssignment - Hypothesis Testing of New Wafer Suppliers\nYour Manufacturing Engineering team is evaluating multiple second-source silicon wafer suppliers in order to\ndiversify Virtual Solar Inc.'s wafer supply chain. Having multiple qualified suppliers both de-risks potential supply\nand-logistics issues and puts pressure on our suppliers to lower their prices. Eight new suppliers are under\nconsideration - of principle concern are (1) wafer price, (2) wafer power performance, and ultimately, (3) $/watt cost\nchanges in the product. Of course, each supplier promises better cost, performance, quality, reliability, yield ...\nPricing data is provided courtesy of VSI's Purchasing Department, which has been in preliminary negotiation with\neach supplier. Purchasing also acquired evaluation samples from each of the new wafer suppliers - 2000 wafers,\nwhich is enough to process 20 \"lots\" of 100 wafers in the fab. The table below summarizes the preliminary pricing\ndata for each supplier.\nOps\nTrusted Wafer Co.\nBaseline Wafer\n$207.99 / 100 pcs\nLine 1\nVirtuawafer Pty.\nA\n$208.00 / 100 pcs\nLine 2\nPremium Wafer Inc.\nB\n$214.81 / 100 pcs\nLine 3\nSi4U Pty.\nC\n$206.01 / 100 pcs\nLine 4\nDiscount Wafer Co.\nD\n$201.23 / 100 pcs\nLine 5\nNot Silicone Inc.\nE\n$205.62 / 100 pcs\nLine 6\nAcme Co.\nF\n$209.99 / 100 pcs\nLine 7\nSunpun Solar Gmbh.\nG\n$214.27 / 100 pcs\nLine 8\nAce Co.\nH\n$214.48 / 100 pcs\nYour team will evaluate one wafer type on your production line, and we will compare notes between teams as a class.\nTo complete the evaluation, your team needs power performance data. However, with only a limited supply of\nevaluation wafers, \"luck of the draw\" and \"common cause variance\" will surely introduce uncertainty into your\nevaluation. So, you will use a statistical hypothesis test approach to quantify and communicate this uncertainty. In\nparticular, your team will use a \"Two-tailed, 95% Confidence, Hypothesized Mean, Z-hypothesis Test About Lot-\nMean Maximum Power (Pmp).\" This type of test has been stipulated by the Director of Manufacturing Engineering.\nHer rationale is\nTest\nDesign\nConsideration\nRational\nAssociated Info\nTwo-tailed\nWe care both about detecting higher and lower power\nperformance in the evaluation\nZcrit = 1.960\n95% Confidence\nThe\nFMEA\nlists\ncontains\nno\npotential\nrisks\nwith\nSeverity/Consequence greater than 7\nC = 95%\nα = 0.05\nHypothesized Mean\nManufacturing Operations has a very precise estimate of the\nmean power performance of Trusted Wafer Co. wafers (from\nmultiple months of solar production data)\nμ0 = 2.4772337\n(watts)\nZ-hypothesis Test\nManufacturing Operations also has a very precise estimate of\nthe standard deviation of power performance of Trusted Wafer\nCo wafers.\nσ0 = 0.017852534\n(watts)\nLot-Mean\nMaximum\nPower (Pmp)\nLot-mean data are Normally distributed and are not auto-\ncorrelated, two necessary conditions for hypothesis tests.\n(Individual wafer data are non-Normal and highly auto-\ncorrelated.)\nQuery Output Params:\n\"Lot-level Data\"\n\"Mean\"\n\"PmP\n\nAssignment Objectives:\n1. Use the VMES Engineering > Data Query and Export feature to query lot-mean Pmp data from 4 initial\nengineering lots pertaining to your assigned wafer type (type A-H). These lots that have already been\nfabricated by Jeff and are ready for evaluation. See the Helpful Tips section at the end of this handout.\n2. Use statistical hypothesis testing to evaluate the data pertaining to your assigned wafer type, against the\ncurrent baseline (see the table above for baseline data). Start with data from the initial 4 lots already prepared\nin the VMES. Report your findings (Zstat, p-value and conclusion) to the class.\n3. Use the VMES Engineering > Action Planner > Eng Lots feature to create 16 additional engineering lots in\nthe VMES. There's an easy shortcut, Jeff will show you in class. When the VMES updates again (around late\no'clock in the night), these lots will be fully fabricated and ready for data query and further analysis.\n4. Repeat the statistical hypothesis testing to evaluate 20 lots of data. Report your findings (Zstat, p-value and\nconclusion) to the class.\n5. Compute the potential performance cost change (delta $/watt against the baseline performance cost) for your\nwafer type.\nWhat to Submit:\n1. One report per team, not more than 1 page in length.\n2. A concise table of your hypothesis test results for the 4-sample and 20-sample evaluations: Zstat, p-value,\nconclusion. Be sure to state your conclusion properly (eg. \"Fail to Reject with 95% confidence and a p-value\nof 0.345\")\n3. Compute the delta in performance cost ($/watt to the 100th of a cent) compared to the baseline case. Make the\nbest possible estimate from your available data. For example, report a savings as -$0.0123/watt and an\nincrease as +$0.0098/watt.\n4. Recommend whether your assigned supplier should be considered as a supplier to Virtual Solar Inc. Make a\nconcise recommendation with support from your data and analyses.\n5. Consider the results from the rest of the class. Recommend the best supplier to consider for Virtual Solar Inc.\nMake a concise recommendation with support from your data and analyses.\n\nHelpful Tips\n1. Getting the Virtual Manufacturing Execution System (VMES) Software\na. The VMES software is free. Download it from https://sites.google.com/site/virtualsolarcellsinc/\nb. After downloading, run the installer. NB: the software runs well on Windows PC, but may have difficulty\non Mac emulators.\n2. Logging Into the Virtual Cell Factory (VCF) using the VMES Software\na. The Virtual Cell Factory is in the cloud, you access it using the VMES software.\nb. Select Account > Login and enter your team's Login Name and Password. Login Name and Password are\nthe same for the MIT class, depending on your assigned line number (\"mitline1\"/\"mitline1\",\n\"mitline2\"/\"mitline2\", etc).\nc. Click Connect, then Select, then Login (your class VCF is \"University/MIT VCF 2013\").\n3. Setting up a Query\na. Select Engineering>Data Query and Export, and then fill up the appropriate query parameters on the\nform. See the illustration below.\nb. Click the Query button. From the resulting table, you can use ctrl-c to copy the pertinent data.\nour line here\n4. Creating 16 additional engineering lots\na. Select Engineering>Action Plan>Eng Lots, and then select one of the previously completed engineerin g\nlots by right clicking on the row header at the left-most position of the Eng Lot table.\nb. Right click again and select Duplicate Multiple.\nc. Enter 16 and click ok.\nd. This will create 16 duplicate engineering lots, all highlighted in red with a Status of \"New\"\nNB: ONLY ONE PERSON SHOULD ENTER THE DUPLIATES, TO AVOID UNNEEDED DUPLICATES!!!!!\nRight click here first to\nselect an engineering lot\nRight click here a second time\nand select \"Duplicate Multiple\"\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n2.627 / 2.626 Fundamentals of Photovoltaics\nFall 2013\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

If methodology is not\npresented, then answers will receive no credit. Additionally, clearly circle all\nfinal answers.\n\nQuestion #1\n\nIn this problem, you will estimate efficiency limits for solar cells as a function of\ntheir band gap energy.\n\na. The short-circuit current density of a solar cell can be calculated from the\nmeasured external quantum efficiency ( ) using the expression\n\n∫ ( ) ( ) ( )\n\nwhere ( ) is the spectral irradiance incident upon the cell, is the\nincident photon energy, and is the band gap of the solar cell.\n\n-\nFind the functional form of in the integral given above that will make\nthe above integral true. (Hint: unit analysis will, again, be helpful).\n\nb. Using the functional fit for the AM0 spectral irradiance ( ) found in\nHW1 - problem 1, plot the short-circuit current density from part (a) as a\nfunction of band gap energy in units of . Be careful with unit\nconversions! Typical band gap energies may range from 0.0 - 5.0 eV.\nAssume an external quantum efficiency of 1.0 (that is, for every absorbed\nphoton, an electron-hole pair is created).\n\n-\nRecall: The functional fit for AM0 spectral irradiance ( ) has the\nform\n\n( )\n\n( )\n\nc. Using the information calculated in part (b) above, estimate how solar cell\nefficiency changes as a function of band gap energy . To do so, assume that\nthe output voltage of the device is equal to the band gap energy per\nfundamental unit of charge (i.e.\n\n).\n\n-\nPlot this estimated device efficiency vs. band gap energy .\n\nd. On the plot created in part (c), please mark the estimated maximum\nefficiencies of the following materials according to their band gap energy: c-\nSi, Ge, a-Si:H.\n\ne. Grad Students Only: Repeat part (c) and part (d), numerically, using data for\nthe AM1.5 spectral irradiance.\n\nQuestion #2\n\nIn this problem, you will explore silicon doping and the diode equation by creating a\nPN junction using two semiconductors of different doping concentrations.\n\na. An n-type material has a 1e20 cm-3 phosphorous concentration and a p-type\nmaterial has a 1e17 cm-3 boron concentration.\n\n-\nEstimate the chemical potential { } (known ubiquitously in solar cell\nphysics as the \"Fermi Energies\") of both materials.

Now combine the two materials together and draw the resulting band\ndiagram on the graph below, assuming thermodynamic equilibrium has been\nreached. Label the intrinsic chemical potential , chemical potential (i.e.\nFermi energy) valence band maximum, conduction band minimum, vacuum\nlevel energy, and width of the space-charge region.\n\nc.

If you require Excel or Matlab, please write-\nout the formulas or methodology used to calculate your answer in a clear and\nconcise manner. If methodology is not presented, then answers will receive no\ncredit. Additionally, clearly circle all final answers.\n\nQuestion #1: Calculate basic performance parameters (20 pts.)\n\nIn this question, we'll have you calculate many of the performance parameters of a\nsolar cell given both the dark and illuminated I-V curves. Assume the illumination is\ndone under AM1.5G illumination. The I-V curves are provided in a separate\nspreadsheet. The measured cell is similar to the one we investigated in class and has\nan area of 3 cm2.\n\na. (11 pts) Plot the following on a single chart with two different y-axes (one for\ncurrent density [mA/cm2], the other for output power [mW/cm2]):\ni. illuminated J-V curve\nii. dark J-V curve\niii. power output of illuminated device as a function of voltage\n\nb. (3 pts.) On the plot created in (a), please label the following:\ni. open-circuit voltage (Voc)\nii. short-circuit current density (Jsc)\niii. maximum power point.\n\nc. (6 pts.)

Current at maximum power point\nv. Fill factor\nvi. Efficiency\n\nQuestion #2: Effect of series resistance (30 pts.)\nThe \"engineering goal\" of your thesis is to make a laboratory-scale solar cell with a\nnew absorber material, \"Wundermaterial.\" You just spent three years optimizing the\ncarrier mobility and lifetime in Wundermaterial by carefully tailoring deposition\nconditions. You're ecstatic that your advisor is satisfied with your results and\nsupports your efforts to make a solar cell device. After using PC1D to calculate\nenergy band diagrams for various Wundermaterial/buffer-layer heterojunctions,\nyou opt to use aluminum-doped zinc oxide (ZnO:Al, or AZO for short) as your buffer\nlayer, since this material combination has large Voc potential. Since you can purchase\nAZO-coated glass (AZO layer thickness = 300 nm), you opt to use a superstrate\nconfiguration shown below, wherein light enters the device from the top (through\nthe glass):\n\nYour devices have an area of 1×1 cm2, since that's a convenient size for your\ndeposition system.\nYou are disappointed when your first solar cell IV curves look like straight lines, i.e.,\nOhmic resistors. Recalling Liebig's Law of the Minimum, you set about trying to\nidentify the root cause of the low efficiency, which you think might be high series\nresistance.\na. (10 pts.) You measure the resistivity of the bare AZO layer on glass using a\nfour-point-probe tool, and find that it has a resistivity of 5×10-3 Ω-cm.\nCalculate the sheet resistance of this 300 nm thick AZO layer. (NB: units of\nsheet resistance are typically given in terms of \"Ohms per square,\" i.e., Ω/☐ .)\n\nb. (10 pts.) From your PC1D simulation (a 1-D simulation tool for solar cells,)\nyou determine that your solar cell should operate at 35 mA/cm2 and 0.62 V\nat the maximum power point. Calculate the fraction of power lost due to\nemitter sheet resistance. Hint: See Slides 76-81 of Lecture 6.\n\nc. (10 pts.) You call your AZO manufacturer and ask for lower resistivity AZO or\nthicker layers. They are out of stock of the good stuff, and your conference\npresentation is fast approaching. What parameter can you change, to reduce\nthe power loss associated with sheet resistance to below 4% of output\npower?\n\nQuestion #3: Diffusion length and Device Performance (30 pts.)\nFor this problem, we will try to understand the effect of lifetime on device\nperformance, mainly IQE and EQE.\n\na. (5 pts.) Let's assume we're illuminating our solar cell with\nmonochromatic light. Given the photon flux incident on the surface is\nsome value Jphoton (in units of photons per area per second,) and the\nreflectivity is R, and the absorption coefficient α, please come up with an\nexpression for the generation rate, G(x), of free carriers as a function of\nposition, x. Assume that each absorbed photon generates one free carrier.\nPlease express G(x) as a function of x, R, Jphoton, and α.\n\nb. (5 pts.) If a carrier is generated at a position x, what is the probability of\nthe carrier reaching the junction? We'll call this value the collection\nprobability. Recall that the distance a carrier can travel is often\ncharacterized by some representative diffusion length, Ldiff. Please report\nthe collection probability, CP(x), as a function of x and Ldiff. Hint: see\nMartin Green's Ch.8!\n\nc. (5 pts.) From the results of both (a) and (b), please write an equation that\nrelates the probability that a photon that is incident on the device surface\ngenerates a carrier that diffuses to the junction. This value is known as\nthe EQE, or external quantum efficiency. For this problem, please make\nthe following assumption:\n- 1/α << cell thickness\n- junction depth from surface << 1/α\n\nd. (1 pt.) Given your answer in part (c), write out an equation for IQE, or\ninternal quantum efficiency.\n\ne. (5 pts.) The solution in part (c) is only valid for certain wavelengths and\nvalues of α. For what wavelength range are the assumption in part (c)\nvalid for a crystalline silicon device that has a 0.5 micron thick emitter\nand a the overall device is 200 microns thick. Please explain your\nreasoning. Recall that optical properties of silicon are posted on\nPVCDROM.\n\nf. (9 pts.) Impurities in silicon can greatly decrease the lifetime of photon-\nexcited carriers. Let's explore just how bad one contaminant, iron, can\nhave on our device. The plot given below shows the lifetime of free\ncarriers in silicon as a function of different iron contaminants. For this\nproblem you may assume the base is p-type and the diffusivity at room\ntemperature of free electrons (minority carriers) is 36 cm2/sec. The\ndiffusion length is calculated by the following: Ldiff = sqrt(D*τ), where τ is\nthe lifetime of the carriers. Please answer the following:\n- What lifetime will bring the IQE (not EQE!) below 90%?\n- What concentration of iron interstitial atoms to reduce the lifetime\nso that the IQE (not EQE!) of 900nm light drops to 90%? Please\nnote that the black markers on the plot below represent the iron\ninterstitial concentration, which is reported in atoms/cm3.\n- If a solar cell uses silicon that is 200 μm thick, what amount of iron\n(in grams) does this translate to for a 1m×1m panel? Does this\nnumber surprise you?\n\nA. A. Istratov, H. Hieslmair, and E.R. Weber, Appl. Phys. A, 70, 489 (2000)\n(c) Springer. All rights reserved.

      "content": "2.626/\nProf. Tonio Buonassisi\n\nQUIZ 2: Design Your Own Solar Cell:\nOptimizing $/W\n\nIntroduction\nFor this quiz, we'll be making our own solar cells. The quiz will be split up into 3\nsections over 3 weeks: design, fabrication, and analysis. The goal is to minimize the\ndollars per watt ($/W) of your cell, and a small fraction of your grade will be\ndecided by this metric. The first section (outlined below) describes the different\nprocesses that go into the fabrication of a simple solar cell design. You're asked to\nchoose between two different options for each processing step. The first deliverable,\ndue 10/20, will be your selection of the different processing steps and a (short)\njustification as to your choices. The next week we'll be fabricating the cells in the\nlab, and will require your attendance in the laboratory to aid in the different steps.\nThe third week will focus on the analysis and testing of the cells. You'll be able to\nmeasure the efficiency of your cell as well as use different analysis techniques to\ntroubleshoot any efficiency-limiting issues in your cell.\n\nOutline Of Fabrication Processes and Associated Costs\n1. Si Wafer\nChoosing a starting wafer for your process is probably one of the most influential\nfactors on the final efficiency for your device. A material that is free of defects or\nimpurities will result in a wafer that has a high minority carrier lifetime, and can\nlead to high efficiency, but will often cost much more. For this class, we have decided\nto just give you one choice of wafer, so we can focus on the different processing\ntechniques to see how that affects the performance. The wafers provided will be\nhigh lifetime (τ>10μs) CZ-grown wafers, and will cost $1 each.\n\n2. Light Management\nAs outline in HW#1, the optical losses can be quite substantial. In order to maximize\nthe number of photons that are absorbed by your device, surface texturing or an\nanti-reflection coating are often used. For light management, you'll be able to choose\nwhether or not to use surface texturing. This will be done by using an alkaline\nchemical etch (KOH or NaOH.) The process results in a random pyramidal structure\nand can effectively increase the photon path length through the device and decrease\n2.627Fall 2011\nFundamentals\n_\nof Photovoltaics\n\nthe reflectivity1 (of note is figure 3.) The etch, which is an optional step, will be\n$0.15 per wafer. We will etch for approx 40 minutes, according to the procedure\nprovided by the paper in the footnote.\n\n3. Phosphorous Diffusion\nTo create the emitter of your solar cell, you dope the surface layer with\nphosphorous, which creates a thin n-type layer. This process is done in a large\nfurnace where silicon wafers are heated to very high temperatures in the presence\nof a phosphorous-bearing gas (POCl3.) The high temperatures allow the diffusion of\nphosphorous into the surface layer of the silicon wafer. This process can take\nseveral hours and is an expensive step of the processing. A longer diffusion process\nwill create a deep n-type layer or emitter, while a short diffusion process will result\nin a shallow n-type layer or emitter. The depth of your emitter has an impact on the\nimpurity gettering that occurs during the cool-down process after diffusion.\nImpurity gettering during cool-down allows many of the metal impurities present in\nyour wafer to be \"sucked up\" by the emitter where they are less detrimental and\nresults in a higher minority carrier lifetime. The emitter depth is often estimated by\nmeasuring the resistance of the surface layer. A thick emitter will have a lower\nresistance (recall the 1/thickness dependence on resistance of a thin film) while a\nshallow emitter will have a high resistance. You will have two options for emitter\nthickness, with the advantages for each approach listed below:\n\n-\nDeep emitter (30 Ohms/sq)\no Improved gettering of metal impurities\no Lower resistance on surface layer, can decrease series resistance\no A thick layer will help prevent against shunts forming from front\ncontacts that can spike through the emitter and effectively short-\ncircuits the junction.\n-\nShallow emitter (80 Ohms/sq)\no Increased IQE of short wavelengths, which can lead to a larger Jsc.\no Cheaper: a shorter diffusion time decreases process time and reduces\nthe energy costs per wafer (running a furnace uses a lot of electricity!)\n\nA shallow emitter will cost $1 while a deep emitter will cost $1.50.\n\n4. Metallization\nThe final step will be to put the front and back contacts onto our solar cell. This\nprocess involves screen-printing a paste that contains small metal particles onto the\nfront and back surfaces of the wafer. After the screen printing, the wafers are fired\nin a furnace that reaches temperature >800C for less than 8 seconds. This process\nallows the metal particles to form a completely interconnected network of metal\nand forms an Ohmic contact with the front and back surfaces. A good Ohmic contact\nis formed because some of the metal atoms diffuse into the surface layer. If the metal\n1 P.K. Singh, R. Kumar, M. Lal, S.N. Singh, B.K. Das, Solar Energy Materials & Solar\nCells, 70, 103 (2001)\n\natoms diffuse to a depth that is deeper than the emitter, you form a shunt (as\nmentioned in process step 3.) For the metallization, you'll have two options for your\nfinger spacing on your front contact. One option is to use fingers that are spaced\n2mm apart, and the other is to use ones that are 4mm apart. Closer finger spacing\nwill decrease the series resistance losses, but increase the shadowing losses, while\nthe wider finger spacing decreases shadowing and increases series resistance\nlosses. Because adding more fingers increases the amount of silver paste used,\nnarrow finger spacing is a slightly more expensive option at $0.40 per wafer as\nopposed to $0.30 per wafer for wider spacing. Diagrams indicating the front contact\npatterns are presented on the following pages.\n\nFlow Chart for Fabrication Process\n\nFront Contact Pattern\n\nQUIZ 2.1 Deliverable (Due 10/20)\n\nThe following questions should be completed and handed in during class on 10/20.\nClearly, the information given is not perfect or complete, so make an educated guess\nas to what the best parameters will be! Each step also affects subsequent steps as\nwell, so please elaborate on any interactions. There are no \"right\" answers here. We\nmainly want to see some good reasoning behind all your educated guesses. This\ndeliverable is only worth 20% of the quiz grade, so don't fret too much about it!\nRemember, we are optimizing for $/W, not efficiency! Busbar widths are 1.5mm and\nfingers are 150 microns wide.\n\nQuestion 1:\n\nA) Please indicate if you would like to perform a surface texturing etch.\nB) Justify your selection by providing a rough, back-of-the-envelope calculation\nthat estimates the relative increase in Jsc for your cell with and without a\nchemical etch. Indicate (briefly) how you think this affects your cost to\nefficiency ratio ($/W) and provide some estimate to this metric.\n\nQuestion 2:\n\nA) Please indicate if you would like a deep or shallow emitter.\nB) Justify your selection briefly by weighing the impacts of impurity gettering,\nsheet resistance, and IQE of short-wavelengths. You may assume that the\nconcentration of diffused phosphorous is around 1×1021cm-3.\n\nQuestion 3:\n\nA) Please indicate your desired finger spacing for your cell.\nB) Justify your selection by making some estimate of series resistance losses in\nyour cell and how that relates to your efficiency to cost ratio ($/W). This\nanswer depends on your selection of emitter depth as well.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n2.627 / 2.626 Fundamentals of Photovoltaics\nFall 2013\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."
