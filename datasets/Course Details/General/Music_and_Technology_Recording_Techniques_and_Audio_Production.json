  "syllabus_content": "Course Meeting Times\n\nMix of lectures, workshops, and recording sessions: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session\n\nDescription\n\nIn this course, you will be introduced to music recording and audio production from a practical and theoretical perspective. You will learn about the physical nature and human perception of sound, how it is transformed to and from electrical signals by means of microphones and loudspeakers, and how it can be creatively modeled through mixing consoles, signal processors, and digital audio workstations. You will learn to make informed choices about microphone selection and positioning, and we will cover various editing, mixing, and mastering techniques.\n\nIntended Learning Outcomes\n\nA student who has successfully completed this course should have demonstrated:\n\nAn understanding of basic principles of acoustics and auditory perception\n\nA practical and theoretical understanding of basic audio recording and production techniques\n\nThe ability to use digital audio workstation (DAW) software for the purpose of manipulating audio data\n\nA critical awareness regarding the cultural, social, and historical context of music technology\n\nPrerequisites\n\nThere are no specific prerequisites for this course.\n\nCourse Entrance Questionnaire\n\nBecause the course has a cap on maximum enrollment, students are selected for admission into the course based on a\nsurvey (PDF)\n.\n\nRecording Equipment at MIT\n\nOur main vehicle for getting hands-on recording experience will be Music and Theater Art's\nMObile Sound System (MOSS)\ndesigned by Chris Ariza, which later in the course we will use to record various bands and ensembles in Killian Hall. While the MOSS will be available only for in-class use, you can borrow one of five Zoom H4n portable audio recorders from the Lewis Music Library's front desk overnight for smaller recording jobs.\n\nRequired Hardware and Software\n\nYou must have reliable access to additional audio editing hardware and software to work on your assignments. See the\nTools\npage for details. Please ensure you have this access by Session 4, including testing the installation of all software packages.\n\nRecommended Textbooks\n\nPurchase of these books is not mandatory, but if you intend to pursue your interest in music technology beyond this course, they should serve you as useful references for years to come.\n\nRayburn, Ray A.\nEargle's Microphone Book: From Mono to Stereo to Surround, A Guide to Microphone Design and Application\n. 3rd ed.

Email submissions will not be accepted under any circumstances, even if the MIT system is down.\n\nYou can help me make the grading process much more efficient by sticking closely to the submission guidelines given in each assignment's instructions: for instance, a .zip containing files whose names strictly follow the guideline.\n\nYou need to complete all assignments and quizzes in order to pass this course, and you are expected to submit all assignments on time. Late submissions will initially incur a penalty of one letter grade per 24 hours. Repeat offenders will eventually receive zero scores until the situation improves.\n\nYour responses to reading assignments will be checked for completeness, but they will not be graded. All other assignments will receive letter grades (without + and - modifiers) per the table above. This grading scheme also applies to your final grade for the course, except that your internal grade report might include a + or - modifier with an A, B, or C letter grade. Corrected quizzes will be returned with the numeric score in addition to the letter grade.\n\nGrading will be conducted in accordance with\nMIT Academic Procedures and Institute Regulations\n.\n\nThere is no final exam for this course.\n\nWorkload\n\nThis is a 12-unit class, which means you should expect to invest about 9 hours of work per week beyond the 3 class hours.\n\nAttendance\n\nYou are expected to attend all class meetings in this course.\n\nAny absences have to be communicated to and approved by the instructor ahead of time, so please email me as soon as you know about any scheduling conflicts. If you will miss an in-class quiz, you need to simultaneously arrange an in-lieu oral exam with the instructor.\n\nUnexcused absences from any in-class presentations will not be tolerated and result in a failing grade for the course. Otherwise, you are entitled to a single unexcused absence without penalty. Any further unexcused absences will negatively affect your final grade.\n\nIn-class quizzes missed due to an unexcused absence cannot be repeated and will receive a zero score.\n\nUse of Electronic Devices in Class\n\nIf you have a laptop, please bring it along to all class meetings that are marked accordingly in the calendar. The use of laptops is only permitted for actual coursework, and I will announce when this is the case. The use of cell phones in class is not permitted.",

In the low frequency range up to 100 Hz, which two frequencies\nwould you expect to be particularly problematic in this room?\nShow how you derived these numbers in the page margin.\n- First frequency: 50\nHz\n- Second frequency: 100\nHz\n2. What makes these frequencies 'problematic' - what does that\neven mean in this context?\nThe fact that modes at these frequencies occur along both di\nmensions, which will raise the likelihood for standing waves at\nthose frequencies. Ideally, modal frequencies are more evenly\ndistributed across the audible spectrum.\n3. Which geometrical property of the room (as we have assumed\nthem above) emphasizes this problem, and how could one re\nduce the likelihood of 'problematic' frequencies?\nRoom's width and height relate to each other in a simple 2:1\nratio, which naturally supports modes between both pairs of\nwalls. To reduce likelihood, choose non-integer ratio.\n2.2 Check all statements that are true (5%)\nWhy is the critical distance dc of interest to recording engineers?\nq Because it informs our decision where on the left-right axis of\nan ensemble to place a stereo microphone.\n7q Because it allows us to estimate the ratio of direct sound to diffuse\nreverberation in a recording.\nq Because it defines the recording angle of a stereo microphone.\n7q Because it informs our decision at which distance from the en\nsemble to position a stereo microphone.\nq Because it tells us where the proximity effect becomes negligible.\nn\nh = 3.4 m\nw = 6.8 m\n340⋅1 = 50 Hz\n2⋅3.4\n340⋅2 = 100 Hz\n2⋅3.4\n340⋅3 = 150 Hz\n2⋅3.4\n340⋅4 = 200 Hz\n2⋅3.4\n340⋅1 = 25 Hz\n2⋅6.8\n340⋅2 = 50 Hz\n2⋅6.8\n340⋅3 = 75 Hz\n2⋅6.8\n340⋅4 = 100 Hz\n2⋅6.8\n2 of 8\n\nInitials:\n.\n.\n21m.380 · Third quiz · Mon, 11/21/2016\n2.3 Room acoustic effects (5%)\nYou will hear a sound example.\n1.

Will you be able to hear the effect of\nyour eq on the headphones? 7m Yes\nm No\nArgue in favor of your answer: The pfl (pre-fader listening) solo\nbus is post-EQ.\n3. Would the guitarist her-/himself likely hear the effect of the\nsame eq on her/his monitoring loudspeaker? m Yes\n7m No\nArgue in favor of your answer: Monitor speakers use pre-fader\naux sends, but pre-fader auxes 1+2 are also pre-eq on this mixer\n4. You use this console to mix a live show. The band has brought\ntheir favorite 19\" mix-in effects: an external reverb unit, a chorus\neffect, and the world's biggest flanger. You explain that even\nthough this mixer has 4 auxiliary sends, it will be tricky to\naccommodate all three effects if the band requires even just a\nsingle monitoring loudspeaker. Why?\nAux 3+4 are post-fader, aux 1+2 can be switched together between\npre- & post-fader. Two possible configs: 4 post-fader, or 2 pre\n$ 2 post-fader aux. But we'd need 3 post-fader (effects) and 1\npre-fader aux (monitor).\n((c) Loud Technologies Inc. With\nedits. All rights reserved. This\ncontent is excluded from our\nCreative Commons license.

What is the name of the physical phenomenon that allows a\nribbon microphone to function? Electromagnetic induction\n2. Describe how this phenomenon works in general terms (not lim\nited to microphones). What happens under which physical\ncircumstances?\nA current will be induced in a conductor that moves relative to\na magnetic field.\n3. How is this general principle applied to microphones? What\nhappens when one records sound with a ribbon mic?\nSound pressure waves move the metal ribbon (conductor), which\nis freely suspended in a magnetic field. This induces a current\nin the ribbon, whose amplitude as a function of time resembles\nthat of the recorded sound pressure.\n4. Does a ribbon microphone generally require phantom power?\nExplain why or why not.\nNo. The primary use of phantom power is to charge the capacitor\nin a condenser microphone, but that capacitor is absent here.\n5 of 6\n((c) Schalltechnik\nDr.-Ing.

Use a high ratio (e.g., 4:1) and fast release time (e.g., 100 ms)\n2. Find useful threshold around the music's 'action point'\n3. Reduce ratio (e.g., to 1.2:1)\n4. Increase release time (e.g., to 250 ms)\n5. Listen and fine-tune attack time, release time, and ratio\n7.2 Side chain manipulation\n- A compressor's side chain includes the envelope follower that measures\nthe level of the input signal (cf., figure 7).\n- Several interesting ways in which side chain can be manipulated:\n- Feed with other instrument (aux in; e.g., bass 'makes room' for kick)\n- Side chain eqing (cf., figure 8): de-essing; prevent kick drum from\n'bringing down' rest of band; etc.\n- Stereo compression: link side chains of l and r inputs\n- Lookahead function: delay main against side chain (peak limiting)\n7.3 Multiband compression\n- Idea: Different transfer functions for different frequency bands\n- Blurs border between compression and eqing\n- Applications:\n- De-essing (ca. 2 kHz to 10 kHz; cf., Katz 2014b, p. 97)\n- Selective compression of individual instruments in a completed mix\n7.4 Parallel compression\n- Idea: Compression as a mix-in effect (cf., figure 9)\n- Motivation: Compress while preserving transients (rapid signal changes)\n- Recipe (Katz 2014c, p. 103):\n- Threshold: -50 dB\n- Ratio: 2.5⁄1\n- Attack time: very short\n- Release time: 250 ms to 350 ms\n6 of 8\ninput\nside chain\nEnvelope\nfollower\nmain chain\noutput\nFigure 7.

Schedule\n2 Session preparation\n- The groups for today's workshop already represent the sound engi\nneering teams for the upcoming recording sessions\n- Each team is expected to:\n1. autonomously prepare their recording session, and\n2. present a session plan in class on the due date of the sr1 assignment.\n- Sit down together as a team right now to start this process.\n- Use the sr1 assignment instructions as a guideline.\n1 of 6\n\n21m.380 · Workshop: Headphone monitoring · Wed, 10/19/2016\n3 Mic task\nNote that the daw team and monitoring team both rely on you!\n1. Set up one dynamic mic (Shure Beta 58a, Shure sm57, or Blue encore\n200) for each of you. A stand is not required, but you can set one up if\nyou feel you need more practice.\n2. Each of you should then identify a suitable preamp such that you\ncould conveniently compress and eq the mic signal while recording.\n3. Do not power up the preamp yet, but connect the mic to the preamp\nfirst. Use the moss patchbay schematics to determine which input on\nthe Switchcraft xlr patchbay you need to use in order to avoid any\nadditional patching.\n4. Identify on the moss patchbay schematics where the preamp's outputs\nwill be routed to by default. How will the signal eventually reach the\ndaw session? Which devices will it pass through? Try to identify those\nin the rack.\n5. Power up the preamp, apply phantom power if needed, and adjust the\npreamp's gain. Verify by eye on the preamp's level meter that you are\nactually getting a signal.\n6. Once the daw team is ready, verify that they are getting a signal from\nall your mics.\n4 Monitor task\nSet up headphone monitoring for two perfomers.\n1. Identify the Hear Back Hub in the small moss road case and the four\naccompanying headphone mixers in the large road case.\n2. Ensure the Hear Back Hub's front panel is set to analog (not adat or\nhearbus).\n3. Connect two headphone mixers to the hub. Which kind of cables do\nyou need for the purpose? Identify and connect them.\n4. In an actual recording session, how would you make sure that the\nmusicians can comfortably operate the headphone mixers?\n5. Connect one pair of Direct Sound ex-29 headphones to each of the two\nheadphone mixers.\n6. On the main patchbay, route all 4 outputs of the two twinq preamps\nsequentially to inputs 3-6 on the Hear Back Hub.\n7. Once the mic team is ready, verify that you receive two mic signals on\neach of the headphone mixers.\n2 of 6\n\n21m.380 · Workshop: Headphone monitoring · Wed, 10/19/2016\nFigure 1.

Power up in the following sequence:\n(a) Rme adi-8 ds (ad/da converter)\n(b) Rme Fireface 800 (audio interface)\n(c) Macbook Pro (login password: md421)\n2. Set the rme adi-8 ds front panel settings to those shown in figure 1.\n3. Open the Fireface Settings application from the dock (at the bottom of\nthe desktop). Compare the settings to figure 2 to make sure the device\nis running as Master at 44.1 kHz.\n4. Open the Fireface Mixer application from the dock, set it to preset 4\n(with inputs muted; cf., figure 3), and leave it running.\n5. Open up Logic Pro from the dock and create a new 16-channel-input\nLogic session:\nNew...\nMy Templates\nrecord16\nFile\n6. Save the session to a new folder on the scratch harddrive (not to the\nDesktop or Home folder):\nscratch 2016-10-19 2016-10-19.logic\n7. Cannot see the Logic mixer (cf., figure 4)?

Import test file: File\nImport Audio File...\nDesktop\ntest.wav .2 Play it back\nin a loop as a test signal for you and the monitoring team.\n10. Patch the Fireface's first two outputs into the Headamp 6 Pro head\nphone amplifier. Are they connected by default?\n11. Connect one Audio-Technica ath-m40 headphone pair for each of you\nto the headphone amp's front panel (starting at channel 1).\n12. Once the mic team is ready, verify that you are getting a signal from\ntheir mics. Monitor the signals throughout their journey:3\n(a) Visually on the adi-8 ds front panel (cf., figure 1)\n(b) On the Fireface Mixer application's input meters (cf., figure 3)4\n(c) On the input channel meters in the Logic session (cf., figure 4)\n(d) On all the headphone amplifier's input channel meters\n(e) By ear on all the headphone amplifier's outputs.\nReferences & further reading\nAriza, Christopher (2012a).

When is it well balanced?\n- When it conveys a sense of unity, of a meta-instrument (coherence)\n- When one can focus on each individual element in it (transparency)\n- Goal: Always allow listener to switch between detail and big picture\n- Regular shift of focus is also a good strategy for mixing itself!\n- Balance must be achieved in many dimensions: levels, spectrum, space\n- But how to judge whether a mix is well balanced? Useful guidelines:\n- Jecklin (2003) defines evaluation factors sound, image, space\n- Ebu defines similar evaluation criteria (Linkwitz 2015)\n1 This is the approach that we will\nadopt for our upcoming in-class\nrecording sessions.\nFigure 1.

Why?\n- Transparency: Different instruments occupy different parts of spectrum\n- Coherence:\n- Spectral separation should not result in mix 'falling apart'\n- Avoid over- or underemphasis on specific frequency bands\n3 of 9\n\n21m.380 · Mixing strategies · Wed, 11/2/2016\n- Consider all frequency bands in the audible spectrum\n- Don't cramp too much into 2 kHz to 5 kHz range (Eargle 2003, p. 330)\n- Roads (2015, p. 380) lists \"magic frequencies\" for mixing purposes\n7.3 Spatial balance\n- Technical means: Panpots, stereo recording techniques, reverb\n- Always do a \"mono reality check\" (Eargle 2003, p. 330)\n- Transparency:\n- Does each phantom source appear from a stable direction?3\n- Consistent phantom source localization at all frequencies?\n- Does each source occupy a credible width, depth4 & height?\n- Coherence:\n- Avoid over- or underemphasis on specific locations\n- Otherwise might result in I mix, V mix, or W mix (Izhaki 2011e))\n- Spatial separation should not jeopardize balance of stereo image\nThe essence of stereo is a sense of spatiality, not a set of\nmono images panned to different positions on the stereo\nstage. (Eargle 2003, p. 330)\n- Stereo image properly centered? (phase correlation meters)\n- Frequency response of diffuse reverberation?\n- Depth of reverberation? (Some reverbs can sound rather flat.)\n- Useful criteria to evaluate spatial balance:\n- Envelopment: \"experience of being surrounded by sound\" (Kendall\nand Ardila 2008, pp. 129 f.)\n- Presence: \"sense of being inside of an (enclosed) space\" (Kendall\nand Ardila 2008, pp. 129 f.)\n- Spaciousness (Blauert 1996)\n- Liveness (Rumsey 2002)\n- Rumsey (2002) distinguishes between source, ensemble, room & scene\n8 Decision making strategies\n- Make decisions quickly, but be prepared to revise them.\n- Comparative listening usually leads to decisions more effectively\n- Usually hard to judge whether X \"sounds good\" in absolute terms\n- Much easier to say whether X sounds better or worse than Y (c)\n4 of 9\nFigure 3.

W mix (after Izhaki 2011d,\nfig. 6.7)\n3 Try also off-sweet-spot listening\npositions to reliably judge phantom\nsource stability.\n4 Depth is a very real factor in stereo\nproduction, starting with the ten\ndency of coincident and binaural\nstereo recording techniques to convey\na better sense of depth than spaced\nor mixed techniques. Katz (2014b)\ndiscusses how to achieve depth and\ndimension in recording, mixing, and\nmastering. Eargle (2003, pp. 330 ff.)\nsuggests to approach a mix in terms\nof layers between foreground and\nbackground. Jecklin (2003, pp. 6 f.)\ndefines (in German) four specific\nsuch layers through which to assess\na mix.\n\n21m.380 · Mixing strategies · Wed, 11/2/2016\n- We always can find a Y to compare X to, since mixing unfolds over time.\n- Example of such iterative editing by Roger Nichols (Senior 2011, sec. 8.2):\n- Turn bass up by +1 dB. Does the mix sound worse?\n- If yes, retreat to original fader position\n- Now, turn bass down by -1 dB. Does the mix sound worse again?\n- If yes, then the original fader position was probably pretty good. (c)\n- Keep the mix simple and never commit to an edit\n- which does not noticeably improve the mix, or:\n- whose effect you cannot hear at all.\n9 Mixing scenarios\n9.1 Main stereo, spot & ambience mics\n- Common in classical music production\n- Raise faders in following order:5\n5 Cf., Eargle 2003, p. 331.\n1. Main stereo mic\n2. Outrigger mics (if applicable)\n3. Ambience mics\n4. Spot mics\n- Use real-world situation as guideline for direction, width & depth\n- How to pan a spot mic with respect to a main stereo mic:\n1. Bring up faders of main stereo mic (panned hard left/right)\n2. Determine direction of instrument in main stereo image\n3. Bring up fader of spot mic to be panned (at relatively low level)\n4. Pan spot mic until it 'locks' with main stereo mic phantom source\n- Optional: Delay spot mics\n- Idea: Compensate runtime differences to main stereo mic\n- Exercise: How to quantify the required delay time?\n9.2 Spot mics only\n- Common in pop, rock & jazz production\n- Eargle (2003, p. 328) suggests to raise faders in following order:\n1. Rhythm tracks (drums, bass, rhythm guitar)\n2. Lead tracks (lead guitar, vocals)\n3. Sweetening (strings, synths)\n5 of 9\n\n21m.380 · Mixing strategies · Wed, 11/2/2016\n- Eargle (2003, p. 328) suggests to process in order of:6\n1. Basic mix (level balance & panning)\n2. Eqing & dynamics\n3. Reverb & other effects\n- Flexible stereo imagery (no main stereo mic to match). Rules of 👍:\n- Center-pan bass, kick drum & solo lead instruments (e.g., vocals)\n- Large instruments use more stereo width (e.g., drumkit, piano, choir)\n- Aim for a well-centered stereo image\n- Look for symmetry (e.g., pan lead guitar half left, lead sax half right)\n- Eargle (2003, p. 332) provides examples of how to layer along depth\n10 Daw parameter automation\nOff\nNeither read nor write\nRead\nRead\nTouch\nRead\nWrite\nRead\nLatch\nRead\nWrite\nWrite\nWrite\nt\nStart\nTouch\nRelease\nStop\nplayback\ncontrol\ncontrol\nplayback\n- Basic idea: Record fader movements to make mix dynamic\n- Can be extended to include all parameters of a mix. Examples:\n- Automate filter cut-off frequency\n- Automate decay time of a reverb plugin\n- Different automation modes support different workflows (cf., figure 6)\n- Read mode completely disregards pre-playback fader positions\n- Touch and latch mode particularly useful; allow for iterative mixing (c)\n- Particularly convenient with external midi controller (rather than mouse):\n- Write, touch, and latch require motorized faders\n- Touch and latch require touch-sensitive controls\n6 of 9\n6 This order has to be taken with a\ngrain of salt. If you eq an instrument\nspecifically to fit it into the overall\nmix, it makes sense to do so after the\nbasic mix has been established. But if\nyou eq to fix instrument-specific prob\nlems regardless of balance with other\ninstruments (e.g., remove a hum from\na guitar amp), you may want to ad\ndress this before worrying about the\nmix. Likewise, if you are working\nexclusively with close-miked signals\nand need to build all reverberation\nfrom scratch, it might make sense to\napply artificial reverb to individual\ninstruments before mixing them.\nFigure 6. Five common automation\nmodes (after Izhaki 2011d, fig. 27.2)\n\n21m.380 · Mixing strategies · Wed, 11/2/2016\n11 Automation in Reaper\n11.1 Overview of Reaper automation modes\n- Reaper offers standard read, touch, latch & write modes\n- Additional trim/read mode (default mode in lieu of off mode)\n- Applies automation envelope relative to pre-playback fader position\n- Pre-playback fader position serves as 'master' level\n- Envelope adds changes 'on top of fader'\n- Additional latch preview mode\n- Like latch, but does not actually write changes\n- Useful for rehearsing complex edits before recording them\n- Switching between modes:\n- Per track: Envelope button in track control panel ( trim by default)\n- Global: Envelope button right of transport bar (overrides per-track)\n11.2 Recording automation data\n1. Click automation icon for target track in track control panel\n2. Select parameters to be automated (try Volume and Pan first)\n3. Envelopes for selected parameters appear beneath audio track\n4. Envelopes need to be armed (analogous to audio) for data to be written\n5. Hit play button (no need to record audio to capture automation data)\n11.3 Editing automation envelopes offline by mouse\nPreferable for coarse edits (e.g., adding +3 dB to the bridge):\n1. Set automation mode to Trim/Read (which is Reaper's default)\n2.\n+ left-click on automation envelope to create a new point\n3. Drag points around while holding left mouse button\nReferences & further reading\nBlauert, Jens (1996). Spatial Hearing. The Psychophysics of Human Sound\nLocalization. Revised edition.
