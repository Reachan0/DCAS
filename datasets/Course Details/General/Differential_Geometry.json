We write\ndet(X, Y ) for the determinant of the matrix with column vectors X, Y ∈ R2 .\nEquivalently,\ndet(X, Y ) = hJX, Y i\nor\nhX, Y i = det(X, JY ).\nFinally, suppose that X ∈ R2 is any vector, and Y ∈ R2 is a vector of length\none. Then\nX = hY, XiY + det(Y, X)JY.\nTerminology from calculus: a map is called smooth if it is infinitely differ\nentiable.\nLemma 1.1. Let I ⊂ R be an interval, and f : I\nR2 a smooth map such\nthat kf(t)k = 1 for all t. Then\n→\nf0(t) = det(f(t), f0(t))Jf(t).\nDefinition 1.2. A regular curve is a smooth map c : I\nR2, where I ⊂ R\nis an interval, satisfying c0(t) = 0 for all\nt. The curvature\n→\nof c at t is\ndet(c0(t), c00(t))\nκ(t) =\n.\nkc0(t)k3\nIn physics terminology, if distance in R2 is measured in meters m, and time\non I in seconds s, then κ is of type 1/m. For instance, a circle of radius R\nhas curvature 1/R if it is parametrized in an anticlockwise way, and -1/R\nif it is parametrized in a clockwise way.\nProposition 1.3 (Frenet equation of motion). For a regular curve c,\nd\nc0(t)\nc0(t)\ndt\nkc0(t)k\n= kc0(t)kκ(t)J kc0(t)k = κ(t) Jc0(t).\nCorollary 1.4. If κ(t) = 0 for all t, then c(I) ⊂ R2 is part of a straight\nline.\nCorollary 1.5. Suppose that κ(t) = 1/R is a nonzero constant. Then\nc + RJ k\nc\nc\n0k is constant, and therefore c is part of a circle of radius |R|.\n\nLecture 2\nA graph is a curve of the form c(t) = (t, f(t)).\nLemma 2.1. The curvature of a graph is\nf00(t)\nκ(t) =\n.\n(1 + f0(t)2)3/2\nA unit speed curve is a curve c such that kc0(t)k = 1.\nLemma 2.2. The curvature of a unit speed curve is\nκ(t) = det(c0(t), c00(t)).\nMoreover, we have\nc00(t) = κ(t) Jc0(t),\nand in particular |κ(t)| = kc00(t)k.\nOne can think of this as the motion of a charged particle in a magnetic field\npointing \"out of the plane\", with strength κ(t).\nProposition 2.3. For every κ : I\nR there is a unit speed curve c : I\nR\n→\n→\nwhose curvature is κ. Moreover, c is unique up to translations and rotations.\nIt is often useful to change the way in which a curve is parametrized. Let\nc : I\nR2 be a regular curve, and ψ : I\nI a smooth function such that\n→\n→\nψ0(t) > 0 for all t. Then c(t) = c(ψ(t)) is again a regular curve, called a\npartial reparametrization of c.\nProposition 2.4. If c(t) = c(ψ(t)) is a partial reparametrization, their\ncurvatures are related by κc (t) = κc(ψ(t)).\nIf ψ : I\nI is onto, we call c a reparametrization of c. Such changes of\n→\nparameter can be inverted, as the following well-known statement shows.\nLemma 2.5 (from calculus). Let I ⊂ R be an interval, and ψ : I → R a\nsmooth function such that ψ0(t) > 0 for all t. Then ψ(I ) = I is an interval,\nand ψ is a one-to-one map from I to I . Moreover, its inverse map φ = ψ-1\nis again smooth, and by the chain rule φ0(t) = 1/ψ0(φ(t)).\nLemma 2.6. Let d = (d1, d2) be a curve such that d0\n1(t) > 0 for all t. One\ncan then reparametrize it to a graph.\nLemma 2.7. Every curve d admits a reparametrization which is a unit speed\ncurve.\n\nLecture 3\nLet c, d be two unit speed curves. We say that c and d osculate at t0 if they\nare both defined at that point and satisfy\nc(t0) = d(t0),\nc0(t0) = d0(t0),\nc00(t0) = d00(t0).\nBecause the curves are unit speed, c00(t0) = d00(t0) is equivalent to saying\nthat κc(t0) = κd(t0).\nProposition 3.1. Let c be a unit speed curve, and t0 a point where κ(t0) =6\n0. Then there is a unique circle which osculates c at t0 (the osculating circle).\nThe curvature |κ(t0)| is then the inverse radius of the osculating circle at\nthat point. If the curvature is zero, there is no osculating circle, and instead\nthe curve osculates its tangent line.\nProposition 3.2. Let f : U\nR be a smooth function, defined on an open\nsubset U ⊂ R2 . Let c : I →\n→\nU be a regular curve, which is contained in\nits level set {f(x) = a}. Then, at every point t such that x = c(t) satisfies\nrf(x) = 0, we have\n±κ(t) = hJrf(x), D2f(x)Jrf(x)i.\nkrf(x)k3\nHere, D2f(x) is the Hessian (the matrix of second derivatives).\nThe sign is determined as follows. If det(rf(x), c0(t)) > 0, then κ(t) is the\nright hand side of the equation above. Otherwise, -κ(t) is the right hand\nside.\nExample 3.3. Let f : R2\nR be a function with f(0) = 0, Df(0) = 0, and\n→\nD2f(0) positive definite (so that the origin is a local minimum). Then as\none gets closer and closer to the origin, the curvature of the level sets goes\nto infinity.\n\n!\nLecture 4\nAs the first of our two generalizations, we look at the Minkowski plane,\nwhich is R2 with the indefinite bilinear form hX, Y iMin = X1Y1 - X2Y2.\nThe role of J is played by the matrix\nK =\n.\nIn particular hX, KXiMin = 0, which is the analogue of det(X, X) = 0 in\nthe Minkowski context. Take two vectors X, Y where hY, Y iMin = 1. One\ncan then write\nX = hY, XiMinY -hKY, XiMinKY.\nA regular curve c : I → R2 is called spacelike if hc0(t), c0(t)iMin > 0 for all t.\nWe define the curvature of c to be\nhc0(t), Kc00(t)iMin\nκ =\n.\nkc0(t)k3\nThe equation of motion is then\nd\nc0\n= -κ(t)Kc0.\ndt\nhc0, c0i 1/2\nMin\nThe curvature is reparametrization invariant. Every spacelike curve admits\na reparametrization c = c(ψ) such that hc 0(t), c 0(t)iMin = 1 (for the opposite\ncase of timelike curves, this would be called proper time parametrization).\nFor curves with this property, the equation of motion simplifies to\nc00(t) = -κ(t)Kc0(t).\nExample 4.1. c(t) = (cosh(t), sinh(t)) is the analogue of a circle. It is\nparametrized with unit speed, and its curvature is constant equal to -1.\n\nz\n}|\n{\nLecture 5\nOur second generalization is to curves in higher-dimensional Euclidean space.\nA regular curve in Rn is a smooth map c : I → Rn, where I ⊂ R is an\ninterval, such that c0(t) =6\n0 for all t. The naive generalization of our two-\ndimensional definition would be\ndet(c0, c00, . . . , c(n))\nkc0(t)kn(n+1)/2\n,\nwhere det is the determinant of the matrix with given column vectors. This\nis reparametrization invariant. Physically it's of type m-n(n-1)/2, where m\nis the unit of distance in Rn . Frenet theory decomposes this as a product of\ncurvatures, each carrying different information.\nLemma 5.1 (Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization). Let (v1, . . . , vk) be linearly\nindependent vectors. There are unique orthonormal vectors (e1, . . . , ek) of\nthe form\nX\nei =\nfij vj\nj≤i\nwhere fii > 0. Note that in particular, each (e1, . . . , ei) spans the same\nsubspace as (v1, . . . , vi). An explicit inductive formula is\nei = vi -hvi, e1ie1 -· · · -hvi, ei-1iei-1 .\nkvi -hvi, e1ie1 -· · · -hvi, ei-1iei-1k\nLemma 5.2. Let E(t) be a family of orthogonal matrices, depending differ\nentiably on t. Write\nd E(t) = E(t)A(t).\ndt\nThen the matrices A(t) are skewsymmetric, A(t)tr = -A(t).\nDefinition 5.3. c : I\nRn is a Frenet curve if for all t, the vectors\n→\n(c0(t), c00(t), . . . , c(n-1)(t)) are linearly independent.\nOne then defines the Frenet frame (e1(t), . . . , en(t)) as follows. First, ap\nply Gram-Schmidt to (v1(t) = c0(t), . . . , vn-1(t) = c(n-1)(t)), which yields\n(e1(t), . . . , en-1(t)). Then, take the unique vector en(t) which is orthogonal\nto (e1(t), . . . , en-1(t)) and satisfies det(e1(t), . . . , en(t)) = 1.\nThe components of the last vector are\nj-th unit vector\nen,j = det(e1, . . . , en-1, (0, . . . , 1, . . . , 0) ).\nLemma 5.4. Frenet frames are reparametrization invariant. Explicitly, if c\nis a Frenet curve and d(t) = c(φ(t)) a reparametrization, then d is again\nFrenet, and its Frenet frame is related to that of c by\nfi(t) = ei(φ(t)).\n\nY\nLecture 6\nTake a Frenet curve c in Rn.

A regular plane curve is always Frenet. The Frenet basis is\ne1(t) = c0(t)/kc0(t)k, e2(t) = Jc0(t)/kc0(t)k. κ = κ1 is the ordinary curva\nture, and the Frenet equations of motion reduce to Proposition 1.3.\nExample 6.4. Let c : I\nR3 be a space curve, parametrized with unit\n→\nspeed. This is Frenet if and only if c00(t) = 0.

One can write f(t) = (cos θ(t), sin θ(t)), where θ : R\nR is\n→\na smooth function, unique up to adding constant integer multiples of 2π.\nSpecifically, all such functions are of the form\nt\nθ(t) = θ0 +\ndet(f(τ), f0(τ )) dτ.\nt0\nwhere (cos θ0, sin θ0) = f(t0).\nDefinition 7.2. The degree of f is\nZ T\ndeg(f) = 2π (θ(T ) - θ(0)) = 2π\ndet(f(τ ), f0(τ)) dτ ∈ Z.\nInstead of [0, T ], one can take any other interval [t0, t0 + T ].\nLemma 7.3. If deg(f) = 0,\nf is a surjective (onto) map to the unit circle.\nProposition 7.4. Let kpk = 1 be a point on the circle with the following\nproperties: (i) There are only finitely many 0 ≤ t1 < t2 <\n< tm < T for\n· · ·\nwhich f(tk) = p; (ii) each such tk satisfies f0(tk) = 0. In that case,\nm\ndeg(f) =\nsign det(p, f0(tk)).\nk=1\nHere is a popular application of degrees. Let f be more generally a T\nperiodic function R → R2 , and q ∈ R2 a point not on its image. The\nwinding number of f around p is the degree of the map f(t) - q/kf(t) - qk.\n\nX\nLecture 8\nDefinition 8.1. A closed curve of period T is a regular curve c : R\nR2\n→\nsuch that c(t + T ) = c(t) for all t. We say that c is simple if it has no\nselfintersections. This means that for all 0 ≤ s < t < T , we have c(s) =6\nc(t).\nTheorem 8.2 (Jordan curve theorem; very sketchy proof). Let c be a simple\nclosed curve. Then, the complement of the image of c is the disjoint union of\ntwo connected open subsets, one bounded (the inside) and one unbounded\n(the outside)\nThe hard step in the proof is to show that the inside and outside are not\nconnected to each other. For that, one uses winding numbers. Points in the\ninside have winding number =6\n0, and points in the outside have winding\nnumber 0. On the other hand, the winding number is locally constant.\nDefinition 8.3. The total curvature of a closed curve is defined to be\nZ T\nκtot(c) =\nκ(t) kc0(t)k dt.\nPhysically, κtot is a dimensionless quantity.\nLemma 8.4 (partial proof). Let c be a closed curve of period T , and set\nL =\nR T kc0(t)k dt. Let d be the unit speed reparametrization of c. Then d is\nagain a closed curve, of period L. Moreover, the total curvature of d is the\nsame as that of c.\nProposition 8.5. κtot(c)/2π is the degree of f(t) = c0(t)/kc0(t)k. In par\nticular, it is always an integer. We call it the rotation number of the curve\n(not to be confused with the winding number: the rotation number is the\nwinding number of c0(t) around 0).\nCorollary 8.6. Let c be a closed curve of period T . Suppose that there\nare only finitely many points 0 ≤ t1 < t2 <\n< tm < T where c0\n2(tk) = 0,\n· · ·\n(tk) > 0, and that any such point satisfies κ(tk) = 0. Then, the rotation\nnumber is\nc0\nm\nκtot(c)/2π =\nsign(κ(tk)).\nk=1\n\nX\nLecture 9\nTheorem 9.1 (Hopf Umlaufsatz; sketch proof). Let c be a simple closed\ncurve. Then κtot(c) = ±2π.\nThe sign here can be determined as follows. Let t be a point where c2(t)\nreaches its (global) minimum. Then the sign of κtot(c) equals that of c0\n1(t).\nDefinition 9.2. Let c be a simple closed curve. We say that c is convex if the\nfollowing holds. Whenever c is tangent to some line {a1x1 +a2x2 = b} in the\nplane, it is entirely contained in one of the two half-planes {a1x1 +a2x2 ≤ b},\n{a1x1 + a2x2 ≥ b}.\nProposition 9.3 (partial proof). A simple closed curve is convex if and\nonly if its curvature never changes sign.\nCorollary 9.4 (sketch proof). Let c be a closed curve of period T . Then\nZ T\n|κ(t)| kc0(t)k dt ≥ 2π.\nHere is a useful generalization of the Umlaufsatz. Take a closed curve c of\nperiod T . Suppose that c takes on the same value at most twice in [0, T ).\nMoreover, for any 0 ≤ s < t < T such that c(s) = c(t), we also require c0(s)\nand c0(t) to be linearly independent. In that case, we say that c has normal\nself-intersections.\nTheorem 9.5 (Whitney; no proof). Let c be a closed curve with normal\nself-intersections. Assume that it is parametrized in such a way that c2(t)\nreaches a global minimum at t = 0. Then\nκtot(c)/2π = sign c0 (0) -\nsign det(c0(s), c0(t)),\n(s,t)\nwhere the sum is over all 0 ≤ s < t < T with c(s) = c(t).\n\nLecture 10\nLemma 10.1 (Sturm-Hurwitz). Let f : R\nR be a continuous 2π-periodic\n→\nfunction such that\nZ 2π\nZ 2π\nZ 2π\nf(t) dt = 0,\nf(t) cos(t) dt = 0,\nf(t) sin(t) dt = 0.\nThen f has at least four zeros in the region [0, 2π).\nLemma 10.2. Let h be a smooth 2π-periodic function. Then h(t) + h00(t)\nhas at least four critical points (points where its derivative vanishes) in the\nregion [0, 2π).\nLemma 10.3. Take a simple closed curve whose curvature is everywhere\npositive. By reparametrizing in a suitable way, one can achieve that the\ncurve has period 2π and satisfies\nc0(t)\nkc0(t)k = (cos(t), sin(t)).\nIn that case,\nκ(t) =\n.\nkc0(t)k\nTheorem 10.4 (Four Vertex theorem, strictly convex version). Take a sim\nple closed curve whose curvature is everywhere positive. Then there are at\nleast four points where κ0(t) = 0."

We say that\nI is an inner product if I(x, x) > 0 for all nonzero x, or equivalently if A is\npositive definite.\nSuppose from now on that I is an inner product. A basis (e1, . . . , en) is\ncalled orthogonal with respect to I if\nI(ei, ei) = 1,\nI(ei, ej ) = 0 for i =6\nj.\nSuch bases always exist. In particular, by passing from the standard basis\nto the basis given by such vectors, one reduces standard about I to ones\nabout the standard inner product h·, ·i. A linear map L : Rn → Rn is\ncalled selfadjoint with respect to I if I(x, Ly) is a symmetric bilinear form.\nEquivalently, this is the case iff AL is symmetric, which means that\nAL = LtrA.\nSuch a matrix L always has a basis of eigenvectors, which is an orthogonal\nbasis with respect to I.\nBackground from multivariable calculus: the derivative or Jacobian of a\nsmooth map f : Rm\nRn at a point x is a linear map Dfx : Rm\nRn . In\n→\n→\nterms of partial derivatives,\nDfx(X) = (\nj ∂xj f1 · Xj ,\nj ∂xj f2 · Xj , . . . ).\nThe chain rule is D(f\ng)x = Dfg(x) Dgx, where the right hand side is\n*\n·\nmatrix multiplication. The second derivative is a symmetric bilinear map\nD2fx : Rm × Rm → Rn (for n = 1, this is a symmetric bilinear form, called\nthe Hessian of the function f). Again explicitly,\nD2fx(X, Y ) = (\ni,j ∂x\nixj f1 · XiYj ,\ni,j ∂x\nixj f2 · XiYj , . . . ).\n\nz\n}|\n{\nLecture 12\nDefinition 12.1. A hypersurface patch is a smooth map f : U\nRn+1 ,\n→\nwhere U ⊂ Rn is an open subset, such that the derivatives ∂x1 f, . . . , ∂xn f ∈\nRn+1 are linearly independent at each point x. Equivalently, the Jacobian\nDfx : Rn\nRn+1 is injective (one-to-one).\n→\nDefinition 12.2. Let f be a hypersurface patch. There is a unique ν : U\nRn+1\n→\nsuch that ν(x) is of length one, is orthogonal to ∂x1 f, . . . , ∂xn f, and\nsatisfies det(∂x1 f, . . . , ∂xn f, ν(x)) > 0. It is automatically smooth. We call\nν(x) the Gauss normal vector of f at the point x.\nLike in Frenet theory, we have an explicit formula. First, define N by\ni-th unit vector\nNi = det(∂x1 f, . . . , ∂xn f, (0, . . . , 1, . . . , 0) ).\nThen ν = N/kNk. For a curve in R2, this simplifies to ν = Jf0/kf0k. For a\nsurface in R3 , N = ∂x1 f × ∂x2 f, hence\nν = ∂x1 f × ∂x2 f/k∂x1 f × ∂x2 fk.\nDefinition 12.3. Define Gij (x) = h∂xi f, ∂xj fi. Equivalently, the matrix\nwith entries Gij (x) is Gx = Dfx\ntr\nDfx. The associated inner product,\n·\nIx(X, Y ) = hX, GxY i = hDfx(X), Dfx(Y )i, is called the first fundamental\nform.\nDefinition 12.4. Define Hij (x) = -h∂xi ν, ∂xj fi = h∂xi ∂xj f, ν(x)i. Equiva\nlently, the matrix with entries Hij (x) is Hx = -Dνtr Dfx. The associated\nx ·\nsymmetric bilinear form, IIx(X, Y ) = hX, HxY i = -hDνx(X), Dfx(Y )i =\nhν(x), D2fx(X, Y )i, is called the second fundamental form.\nG-1\nG-1)tr\nDefinition 12.5. Define a matrix Lx by Lx =\nx Hx = (Hx\nx\n. We\ncall this the shape operator. Equivalently, this is characterized by the prop\nerty that\nIIx(X, Y ) = Ix(LxX, Y ).\nLemma 12.6. Dν = -Df L (matrix multiplication). More explicitly, each\n·\npartial derivative ∂xi ν lies in the linear span of {∂x1 f, . . . , ∂xn f}, and the\nshape operator allows us to express it as a linear combination of these vec\ntors:\nX\n∂xi ν = -\nLji(x)∂xj f.\nj\nExample 12.7. Suppose that f(x) = (x, h(x)), where h is a smooth function\nof n variables. Let p ∈ U be a point where h and Dh both vanish. At that\npoint, G = 1 is the identity matrix, and H (as well as L) is the Hessian\nD2h.\n\nLecture 13\nHere's a summary. Let f : U\nRn+1 be a hypersurface patch, and ν : U\n→\n→\nRn+1 its Gauss map.

It is interesting to\nask to what extent they can be integrated back to determine the hypersurface\nitself.\nExample 13.2. Let f : U\nRn+1 be a hypersurface patch such that L is\n→\n1/R times the identity matrix, for some R =6\n0. Then f + Rν is constant,\nand therefore, the image f(U) is contained in a radius |R| sphere in Rn+1 .\nRn+1\nProposition 13.3. Let f, f : U\nbe two hypersurface patches,\n→\ndefined on the same connected set U ⊂ Rn . Suppose that their first and\nsecond fundamental forms coincide. Then f (x) = Af(x) + c, where A is an\northogonal matrix with determinant +1, and c some constant.\n\nX\nLecture 14\nBy definition Lx is selfadjoint with respect to the inner product Ix. Hence,\nit has a basis of eigenvectors which are orthonormal with respect to Ix. Note\nthat X is an eigenvector of Lx iff HxX = λGxX. Hence, the eigenvalues λ\nare the solutions of det(G - λH) = 0.\nDefinition 14.1. The eigenvalues (λ1, . . . , λn) of Lx are called the principal\ncurvatures of the hypersurface patch f at x. The corresponding eigenvectors\n(X1, . . . , Xn) are called the principal curvature directions.\nIf f = f(φ) is a partial reparametrization of f, then the principal curvatures\nof f at x are equal to the principal curvatures of f at φ(x).\nExample 14.2. Suppose that f is such that f1 achieves its maximum at the\npoint p. Then ν(p) = (±1, 0, . . . , 0). In the + case, all principal curvatures\nat p are ≤ 0. In the - case, all principal curvatures at p are ≥ 0.\nExample 14.3. Suppose that f is such that kfk achieves its maximum at\nthe point p, where kf(p)k = R. Then ν(p) = ±f(p)/kf(p)k. In the + case,\nall principal curvatures at p are ≤-1/R < 0. In the - case, all principal\ncurvatures at p are ≥ 1/R > 0.\nDefinition 14.4. Let λ1, . . . , λn be the principal curvatures of f at x.

Let c be a Frenet curve in R3, parametrized with unit speed.\nConsider the surface patch f(x1, x2) = c(x1)+x2c0(x1), where x2 > 0. Then\nκgauss = 0 and\nτ (x1)\nκmean = -x2\n· κ(x1),\nwhere τ and κ are the torsion and curvature of c as a Frenet curve.\nExample 15.2. Let c : I\nR2 be a curve, parametrized with unit speed,\n→\nwhose first component c1 is always positive. The associated surface of rota\ntion is f : I × R → R3 ,\nf(x1, x2) = (c1(x1) cos x2, c1(x1) sin x2, c2(x1)).\nThe first and second fundamental forms of f are given by\nG =\n2 ,\nH = -c00\n1c0\n2 + c0\n1c2\n;\nc1\nc1c0\nIn particular, κgauss = -c1\n00/c1.\nThis can be used to construct surfaces with constant Gauss curvature, by\nsolving the corresponding equation. For instance, the pseudo-sphere with\nGauss curvature -1 is obtained by setting\nZ t p\nc1(t) = e t , c2(t) =\n1 - e2τ dτ,\nwhere t ∈ (-inf, 0).\n\nX\n\nX\nLecture 16\nDefinition 16.1.

Let f : U\nRn+1 be a hypersurface patch. A moving\n→\nbasis for f is a collection (X1, . . . , Xn) of vector-valued functions Xi : U →\nRn which are linearly independent at each point. If the Xi are orthonormal\nwith respect to the first fundamental form, we call (X1, . . . , Xn) a moving\nframe.\nLet X be the matrix whose columns are (X1, . . . , Xn), and define the con\nnection matrices and their curvature matrices to be, respectively,\nAj = X-1(∂xj X) + X-1ΓjX,\nFkj = ∂kAj - ∂j Ak + AkAj - Aj Ak.\nLemma 18.2. For any moving basis, Fkj = X-1Rkj X.\nLemma 18.3. If the moving basis is a frame, the Aj and Fkj are skew-\nsymmetric matrices.\nLet's specialize to the case of surfaces, n = 2, and take X to be a moving\nframe. Then, F12 is necessarily a multiple of J.

If f is a doubly-periodic surface patch, then the Gauss\ncurvature must be > 0 at some point, and < 0 at some other point.\n\nLecture 19\nBefore continuing, we need more linear algebra preliminaries: write Λ2(Rn)\nfor the space of skewsymmetric matrices of size n. This is a linear subspace\nof Rn2 of dimension n(n - 1)/2. Given v, w ∈ Rn, we denote by v ∧ w the\nskewsymmetric matrix with entries\n(v ∧ w)ij = 1 (viwj - wivj ).\nThis satisfies the rules\nw ∧ v = -v ∧ w,\nw ∧ (u + v) = w ∧ u + w ∧ v.\nLemma 19.1. If (vi)1≤i≤n is any basis of Rn, then (vi ∧ vj )1≤i<j≤n is a basis\nof the space of antisymmetric matrices.\nGiven any linear map L : Rn\nRn, there is an associated map\n→\nΛ2L : Λ2Rn -→ Λ2Rn ,\n(Λ2L)(S) = LSLtr .\nThis satisfies (and is characterized by)\nΛ2L(v ∧ w) = Lv ∧ Lw.\nExample 19.2. If n = 2, then Λ2R2 is one-dimensional, and Λ2L is just\nmultiplication with det(L).\nLemma 19.3. We have\ntrace(Λ2L) = 1 (trace(L)2 - trace(L2)),\ndet(Λ2L) = det(L)n-1 .\nLemma 19.4. Suppose that L, L : Rn\nRn are two linear maps, with\n→\nrank(L) ≥ 3. Then, if Λ2L = Λ2L , it also follows that L = ±L .\nThis is easiest to see if L is a diagonal matrix with entries (1, . . . , 1, 0, . . . , 0),\nand the general case follows from that.\n\nX\nLecture 20\nAn expression is called intrinsic if it depends only on the first fundamental\nform and its derivatives. For instance, G is intrinsic, but H is not intrinsic.\nLess obviously, the Christoffel symbols are intrinsic, and so are the Rs . The\nikj\nlast-mentioned observation deserves to be formulated in a more conceptual\nway.\nLet Λ2L : Λ2Rn\nΛ2Rn be the second exterior product of the shape oper\n→\nator. We call this the Riemann curvature operator, and denote it by R. By\ndefinition\nR(ej ∧ ek) = Lej ∧ Lek =\nLij Lskei ∧ es =\nis\nX\nX X\n\niuRs\n(Lij Lsk - Lsj Lik)ei ∧ es =\ng\nukj ei ∧ es.\ni<s\ni<s\nu\nUnder reparametrization f = f\nφ, the Riemann curvature operators satisfy\n*\nR (x) = (Λ2Dψ(x))-1 · R(ψ(x)) · (Λ2Dψ(x)).\nTheorem 20.1. (Generalized theorema egregium) R is intrinsic.\nCorollary 20.2. The unordered collection of n(n - 1)/2 numbers λiλj is\nintrinsic.\nCorollary 20.3. κscalar and κn-1 are intrinsic. In particular, κgauss is\ngauss\nintrinsic for n even, and |κgauss| is intrinsic for n ≥ 3 odd.\nCorollary 20.4. Let f : U\nRn+1 be a hypersurface patch, defined on a\n→\nconnected set. Suppose that for each point in U, the matrix Hx has rank\n≥ 3. In that case, the intrinsic geometry of f determines the extrinsic one.\nRn+1\nThis means that if f : U\nis another hypersurface patch with the\n→\nsame first fundamental form as f, then necessarily f (x) = Af(x) + c with\nA an orthogonal matrix, and c a constant.\n\nLecture 21\nTo get some intuition for the intrinsic viewpoint, let's look at the problem\nof simplifying the first fundamental form by a local change of coordinates.\nMore precisely, let f : U\nRn+1 be a hypersurface patch, and p a point of\n→\nU\n\n. A local reparametrization near p is a partial reparametrization f = f *φ :\nU → Rn+1, where p ∈ U and ψ(p) = p. Such local reparametrizations are\neasy to find, because det(Dφ(p)) > 0 implies positivity of that determinant\nfor points close to p.\nLemma 21.1. For any point p, there is always a local reparametrization such\nthat in the new coordinates, G p = 1 is the identity matrix.\nLemma 21.2. Suppose that we have numbers Sijk (the indices i,j,k run from\n1 to n) such that Sijk = Sjik. Then there are numbers Tijk with Tijk = Tkji\nsuch that\nSijk = Tijk + Tjik.\nCorollary 21.3. For any point p, there is always a local reparametrization\nsuch that in the new coordinates, G p = 1 and ∂xk G p = 0 for all k.\n\nLecture 22\nOur first generalization is to hypersurfaces in Minkowski space. Take Rn+1\nwith the Minkowski form hX, Y iMin = X1Y1+X2Y2+\n+XnYn-Xn+1Yn+1.\n· · ·\nDefinition 22.1. A spacelike hypersurface in Minkowski space is a smooth\nmap f : U\nRn+1, where U ⊂ Rn is an open subset, such that at every\npoint x ∈ U\n→\n, the derivatives (∂x1 f, . . . , ∂xn f) are linearly independent and\nspan a subspace of Rn+1 on which h·, ·iMin is positive definite.\nMore concretely, f is spacelike if the matrices G(x) with entries Gij (x) =\nh∂xi f, ∂xj fiMin are positive definite for all x. We define this to be the first\nfundamental form of the hypersurface. Using the usual intrinsic formulae, we\ncan now define the Christoffel symbols Γk and the Rs , hence the Riemann\nij\nujk\ncurvature operator R.\nDefinition 22.2. The Gauss normal vector of a spacelike hypersurface\nis the unique ν = ν(x) such that hν, νiMin = -1, hν, ∂xi fiMin = 0, and\ndet(∂x1 f, . . . , ∂xn f, ν) > 0.\nGiven that, we now define H by Hij = -h∂xi ν, ∂xj fiMin = hν, ∂2\nfiMin\nxixj\nand L = G-1H. Some of the usual equations pick up additional signs, for\ninstance:\n∂2f\nX\n=\nΓk\n∂xi∂xj\nij ∂xk f - Hij ν.\nk\nSimilarly, the theorema egregium says that R = -Λ2(L). In particular,\nfor spacelike surfaces, the Gauss curvature is κgauss = - det(H)/ det(G) =\n- det(L).\nLemma 22.3 (no proof). If X ∈ Rn+1 has hX, XiMin < 0, then its Minkowski\northogonal complement X⊥ = {Y ∈ Rn+1 : hX, Y iMin = 0} has the prop\nerty that h·, ·iMin restricted to X⊥ is positive definite.\nExample 22.4. Hyperbolic n-space is defined to be Hn = {X ∈ Rn+1 :\nXn+1 > 0, hX, XiMin = -1}.\nSuppose that f : U\nRn+1 is some\n→\nparametrization of Hn . Since hf, ∂xi fi = 0, it follows from the Lemma\nthat f is spacelike. It has Gauss normal vector ν = ±f. Hence H = G\nand L = 1. Hence, κgauss = -1.\nTwo explicit parametrizations of hyperbolic n-space: the first is the Poincar e\nor conformal ball model\nf : U\n,\n= {x ∈ Rn : kxk < 1} -→ Rn+1\nf(x) =\n(2x1, . . . , 2xn, 1 + kxk2).\n1-kxk2\n\n(\nGeometrically, this corresponds to taking a disc in Rn × {0}, and then pro\njecting radially from the point (0, . . . , -1). In this model,\n=\n(1-k\nxk2)2\ni = j,\nGij\ni =6\nj.\nThe second is the Klein or projective ball model\nf : U = {x ∈ Rn : kxk < 1} -→ Rn+1 ,\nf (x) =\n(x1, . . . , xn, 1).\n√\n1-kxk2\nGeometrically, one takes the disc tangent to Hn at the point (0, . . . , 0, 1),\nand then projects radially from the origin. The resulting first fundamental\nform is\n(\n+\nxi\ni = j,\nG ij =\n1-k\nx\nx\nix\nk\nj\n(1-kxk2)2\ni = j.\n(1-kxk2)2\n\nX\nX\nX\nLecture 23\nOur second generalization is to submanifolds which are not hypersurfaces.\nLet U ⊂ Rn be an open subset. A regular map (or immersion) f : U →\nRn+m is a smooth map such that the partial derivatives ∂x1 f, . . . , ∂xn f are\nlinearly independent at each point. The first fundamental form is then\ndefined as usual by\nG = Dftr Df.\n·\nDefinition 23.1. A set of Gauss normal vectors for f consists of maps\nν1, . . . , νm : U\nRn+m satisfying\n→\nhνw, νwi = 1,\nhνv, νwi = 0 for u =6\nw,\nhνw, ∂xi fi = 0,\ndet(∂x1 f, . . . , ∂xn f, ν1, . . . , νm) > 0.\nSuch maps may not necessarily exist over all of U, but they can be defined\nlocally near any given x ∈ U by the Gram-Schmidt method. Moreover, any\ntwo choices defined on the same subset are related by\nν w =\navwνv ,\nv\nwhere avw are the coefficients of an orthogonal matrix A = A(x) with\ndet(A) = 1.\nDefinition 23.2. Given a set of Gauss normal vectors, we define the second\nfundamental forms Hw , w = 1, . . . , m, by\nHw = -h∂iνw, ∂j fi = hνw, ∂2f/∂xi∂xj i.\nij\nThe corresponding shape operators are Lw = G-1Hw .\nOne then has\n∂2f\nX\nX\n=\nΓij\nk ∂xk f +\nHij\nwν,\n∂xi∂xj\nk\nw\nwhere the Christoffel symbols Γk are given by the usual intrinsic formulae.\nij\nThe Gauss equation says that\nHw\nΓt Γs\nΓs\nsk - Hw\nsj\nij - ∂j Γs\nij\nik\nw\nt\nij Lw\nikLw = ∂kΓs\nik +\nkt - Γt\njt.\nIt is easy to check explicitly that the left hand side is independent of the\nchoice of νw . The Riemann curvature operator, given by the usual intrinsic\nformulae, now reads\nX\nR =\nΛ2(Lw).\nw\n\nZ\np\nIts eigenvalues are now less constrained than in the hypersurface case, hence\nthe connection between intrinsic and extrinsic geometry is somewhat weaker.\nOur final generalization is to a completely intrinsic viewpoint. A Riemann\nian metric on U ⊂ Rn is a family Gx of positively definite symmetric nxn\nmatrices, depending smoothly on x ∈ U. For any such metric, and indepen\ndently of any embedding of U into another space, one can define Christoffel\nsymbols, the Riemann curvature operator, and all its dependent quantities\n(scalar curvature, for instance). The proof of Corollary 18.6, for instance, is\npurely intrinsic and shows the following:\nCorollary 23.3. Take any Riemannian metric on R2 which is doubly-\nperiodic, G(x1+T1,x2) = G(x1,x2) = G(x1,x2+T2). Then\nκtot\ngauss =\nκgauss\ndet(G)dx1dx2 = 0.\n[0,T1]×[0,T2]"

A hypersurface is a subset M ⊂ Rn+1 with the following\nproperty. For every y ∈ M there is an open subset V ⊂ Rn+1 containing y,\nand a function ψ : V → R whose zero set ψ-1(0) is precisely M ∩ V , and\nwhose derivative is nonzero at any point of M ∩ V .\nExample 24.2. M = {x1x2x3 = 0} ⊂ Rn+1 is not a hypersurface.\nWe call ψ a local defining function for M near y. We are looking for prop\nerties of M that are independent of how it is presented as a zero set. The\nfollowing is useful:\nProposition 24.3 (L'Hopital's rule; proof postponed). Let ψ : V\nR be a\n→\nlocal defining function for M, and φ : V\nR another smooth function which\n→\nvanishes along V ∩ M. Then there a unique smooth function q : V → R\nsuch that φ = qψ.\nCorollary 24.4. Let ψ, ψ : V\nR be two local defining functions for M.\n→\nThen there is a unique smooth nowhere vanishing function q : V\nR such\nthat ψ = qψ.\n→\nLet M be a hypersurface, ψ : V → R a local defining function, and y ∈ V ∩M\nany point. The derivative Dψy is independent of the choice of ψ up to\nmultiplication with a nonzero real number. Hence, its nullspace\nTMy = kerDψy = {Y ∈ Rn+1 | Dψy · Y = hrψy, Y i = 0}\nis independent of ψ. We call it the tangent space of M at y.\nExample 24.5. The unit sphere Sn = {ky|2 = 1} ⊂ Rn+1 is a hypersurface,\nand TSy\nn = y⊥.\n\nX\nLecture 25\nLet M ⊂ Rn+1 be a hypersurface. If ψ is a local defining function for M,\nthen the map rψ/krψk : M ∩ V → Sn is independent of the choice of ψ\nup to sign. This ambiguity will be further discussed later. Similarly, for all\ny ∈ M ∩ V , the linear map\nLy : TMy -→ TMy, Ly(Y ) = -D(rψ/krψk)y · Y\nis independent of the choice of ψ up to sign. We call it the shape operator\nof M at y.\nExample 25.1. Take the hyperboloid M = {y1\n2 = y2\n2 + y3\n2 + 1} in R3 (this\nis Euclidean space, and not to be confused with curvature computations in\nMinkowski space). The tangent space at any point y is spanned by Y1 =\n(y2, y1, 0) and Y2 = (y3, 0, y1). The matrix of D(rψ/krψk)y : TMy → TMy\nwith respect to this basis is\ny1\n2 - y2\n2 + y2\n-2y2y3\nkyk3\n-2y2y3\ny1\n2 - y3\n2 + y2\nLemma 25.2. For X, Y ∈ TMy,\nhX, Ly · Y i = -\nψkhX, D2ψy · Y i.\nkry\nThis proves that Ly is selfadjoint with respect to the standard inner product\nh·, ·i on TMy. In particular, it has real eigenvalues, which we call the prin\ncipal curvatures. The mean, Gauss, and scalar curvature are then defined\nas usual. Finally, the Riemann curvature operator is defined to be\nRy = Λ2(Ly) : Λ2(TMy) -→ Λ2(TMy).\nNote that Λ2(Ly) = Λ2(-Ly), so the Riemann curvature operator does not\nsuffer from sign ambiguities. The same applies to the Gauss curvature if n\nis even.\nExample 25.3. The Gauss curvature of the hyperboloid discussed above is\nthe determinant of Ly, which is (2y1\n2 - 1)/kyk6 .\nProposition 25.4. Let M ⊂ Rn+1 be a hypersurface. Take a point y ∈ M,\na local defining function ψ for M near y, and an orthonormal basis Y1, . . . , Yn\nof the tangent space TMy.\nn\nκmean = ±\nhYi, D2ψy · Yii,\nkrψyk i=1\ndet(D2ψy · Y1, . . . , D2ψy · Yn, rψy)\nκgauss = ±\nkrψykn+1\n.\n\nLecture 26\nLet M ⊂ Rn+1 be a hypersurface.\nDefinition 26.1. A function f : M\nR if smooth if for every point y ∈ M\nthere is an open subset V ⊂ Rn+1\n→\ncontaining y, and a smooth function\nf : V → R, such that f|M ∩ V = f |M ∩ V . We call f a local extension of f.\nThe derivative Dfy is the linear map TMy → R defined by Dfy = Df y | TMy.\nThis is independent of the choice of local extension.\nThis generalizes to several functions, which means to maps f : M\nRk+1 .\n→\nIf M ⊂ Rn+1 and N ⊂ Rk+1 are hypersurfaces, and f : M → Rk+1 a smooth\nmap whose image lies in N, then the image of the derivative Dfy lies in the\ntangent space to N at f(y). Hence, Dfy is a linear map TMy → TNf (y).\nDefinition 26.2. A Gauss map for M is a smooth map ν : M\nRn+1 such\nthat for all y, ν(y) is of unit length and orthogonal to TMy.\n→\nWe also call a Gauss map a choice of orientation. Suppose that such a ν is\ngiven. If ψ is a local defining function for M, we have ν = ±rψ/krψk on\nM ∩ V , where the sign is locally constant. If the sign is positive everywhere,\nwe say that ψ is compatible with the choice of orientation.\nConsider the derivative of the Gauss map, which is\nDνy : TMy -→ T (Sn)ν(y) = ν(y)⊥ = TMy.\nWe re-define the shape operator to be Ly = -Dνy. This agrees with the\nprevious definition, except that the sign ambiguity has been removed by the\nchoice of orientation.\nRemark 26.3. In Proposition 25.4, assume that M is oriented, and ψ com\npatible with the choice of orientation. Then the sign in κmean is -1. Assume\nin addition that the basis is chosen in such a way that det(Y1, . . . , Yn, rψy) >\n0. Then the sign in κgauss is (-1)n .\n\nV\nLecture 27\nDefinition 27.1. Let U, V be open subsets of Rn+1 . A smooth map φ :\nU is a diffeomorphism if it is one-to-one and the inverse φ-1 is also\n→\nsmooth (it is in fact enough to check that φ is one-to-one and that Dφy is\ninvertible for all y, since that ensures smoothness of the inverse).\nOne can think of diffeomorphisms as curvilinear coordinate changes.\nTheorem 27.2 (Inverse function theorem; no proof). Let V ⊂ Rn+1 be an\nRn+1\nopen subset, y ∈ V a point, and φ : V →\na smooth map such that\nDφy is invertible. Then there is an open subset V ⊂ V , still containing y,\nsuch that: U = φ(V ) is open, and φ|V : V → U is a diffeomorphism.\nCorollary 27.3 (Implicit function theorem, special case). Let V ⊂ Rn+1\nbe an open subset, ψ : V → R a smooth function, and y ∈ V a point such\nthat ψ(y) = 0, Dψ(y) 6= 0. Then there are: an open subset V ⊂ V , still\ncontaining y; an open subset U ⊂ Rn+1 containing 0; and a diffeomorphism\nφ : U\nV such that φ(0) = y, and ψ(φ(x)) = xn+1 for all x.\n→\nThe informal meaning is that in the curvilinear local coordinate system φ,\nψ looks like a linear function.\n\nLecture 28\nLet M ⊂ Rn+1 be a hypersurface. Take a local defining function ψ : V → R,\ndefined near some point y ∈ V . The derivative Dψy : Rn+1 → R depends\non ψ, but its nullspace\nker(Dψy) = {X ∈ Rn+1 | Dψy · X = hrψy, Xi = 0}\ndoes not, since it is the tangent space TMy. Now assume that M comes\nwith a Gauss vector, which on V ∩ M agrees with rψ/krψk. The Hessian\nRn+1 × Rn+1 → R, (X, Y ) 7→ hX, D2ψyY i depends on Y , but the map\nTMy × TMy -→ R, (X, Y ) 7-→ krψkhX, D2ψyY i\nis independent of ψ, since it can be written as -hX, LY i where L : TMy →\nTMy is the shape operator.\nExample 28.1. Take the hyperboloid M = {y1\n2 = y2\n2 + y3\n2 + 1} in R3 (this\nis Euclidean space, and not to be confused with curvature computations in\nMinkowski space). A Gauss normal is\nν(y) =\n(-y1, y2, y3).\nkyk\nThe tangent space at any point y is spanned by Y1 = (y2, y1, 0) and Y2 =\n(y3, 0, y1). The matrix of Dνy : TMy → TMy with respect to this basis is\ny1\n2 - y2\n2 + y2\n-2y2y3\nkyk3\n-2y2y3\ny1\n2 - y3\n2 + y2\nThe Gauss curvature is its determinant, which is (2y1\n2 - 1)/kyk6 . In partic\nular, it's always positive.\nLet U, V be open subsets of Rn+1 . A smooth map φ : V\nU is a diffeo\n→\nmorphism if it is one-to-one and the inverse φ-1 is also smooth (it is in fact\nenough to check that φ is one-to-one and that Dφy is invertible for all y, since\nthat ensures smoothness of the inverse). One can think of diffeomorphisms\nas curvilinear coordinate changes.\nTheorem 28.2 (Inverse function theorem; no proof). Let V ⊂ Rn+1 be an\nRn+1\nopen subset, y ∈ V a point, and φ : V →\na smooth map such that\nDφy is invertible. Then there is an open subset V ⊂ V , still containing y,\nsuch that: U = φ(V ) is open, and φ|V : V → U is a diffeomorphism.\n\nLecture 29\nCorollary 29.1 (Implicit function theorem, special case). Let V ⊂ Rn+1\nbe an open subset, ψ : V\nR a smooth function, and y ∈ V a point such\nthat ψ(y) = 0, Dψ(y) = 0. Then there are: an open subset V\nV , still\n→\n⊂\ncontaining y; an open subset U ⊂ Rn+1 containing 0; and a diffeomorphism\nφ : U\nV such that φ(0) = y, and ψ(φ(x)) = xn+1 for all x.\n→\nThe informal meaning is that in the curvilinear local coordinate system φ,\nψ looks like a linear function.\nLemma 29.2. Let U ⊂ Rn+1 be an open subset contaning the origin, and\nψ : U → R a smooth function which vanishes at all points x ∈ U whose last\ncoordinate xn+1 is zero. Then there is a unique smooth function q such that\nψ = qxn+1.\nThis and the previous Corollary together imply our version of l'Hopital's\ntheorem (Lemma 20.2).\nDefinition 29.3. Let M be a hypersurface. A partial parametrization of\nM consists of an open subset V ⊂ Rn+1, an open subset U ⊂ Rn, and a\nhypersurface patch f : U\nRn+1 which is one-to-one (injective), and whose\nimage is precisely M ∩ V .\n→\nCorollary 29.4. For every point y ∈ M, there is a partial parametrization\nsuch that y ∈ f(U) = M ∩ V .\nIf f is a partial parametrization, the ∂xi f form a basis of TMf(x) for all x.\nEquivalently, Dfx : Rn\nTMf (x) is an isomorphism (an invertible linear\n→\nmap). In the case where M comes with a Gauss vector field ν : M\nRn+1 ,\n→\none can always choose these partial parametrizations to be compatible with\nit, which means that det(∂x1 f, . . . , ∂xn f, ν(f(x))) > 0.\nProposition 29.5. Let f be a partial parametrization. Denote by If its first\nfundamental form, and by Sf its shape operator. Under the identification\nDf : Rn\nTMf(x), If turns into the ordinary scalar product, and Sf into\n→\nthe shape operator S of M.\nExplicitly, the second part of this says that S : TMf(x)\nTMf (x) and\n→\nSf : Rn\nRn are related by\n→\nSf = Df-1 S Df.\n·\n*\n\nX\nLecture 30\nProposition 30.1. Let M ⊂ Rn+1 be a hypersurface. Take a point y ∈ M,\na local defining function ψ for M near y, and an orthonormal basis Y1, . . . , Yn\nof the tangent space TMy.\nn\nκmean = ±\nhYi, D2ψy · Yii,\nkrψyk i=1\ndet(D2ψy · Y1, . . . , D2ψy · Yn, rψy)\nκgauss = ±\nkrψykn+1\n.\nAssume that ν(y) = rψy/krψyk. Then the sign in κmean is -1. Assume in\naddition that the basis is chosen in such a way that det(Y1, . . . , Yn, rψy) > 0.\nThen the sign in κgauss is (-1)n .\nDefinition 30.2. A hypersurface M ⊂ Rn+1 is compact if it is bounded\nand closed (closedness means that if a sequence yn ∈ M converges to some\npoint yinf ∈ Rn+1, then that point must also lie in M).\nDefinition 30.3. A hypersurface M ⊂ Rn+1 is connected if every smooth\nfunction φ : M\nR whose derivative is identically zero is actually constant.\n→\nTheorem 30.4 (from topology; no proof). A connected compact hypersur\nface is always orientable (in fact, there are precisely two choices of Gauss\nvectors, differing by a sign).\nTake a connected compact hypersurface, oriented inwards. Then there is\na point where all principal curvatures are > 0. Similarly, for the outwards\norientation, there is a point where all principal curvatures are < 0. This\nfollows from Example 14.3.\nTheorem 30.5 (from topology; no proof). Let M ⊂ Rn+1 be a connected\ncompact hypersurface, with n ≥ 2, and φ : M → Sn a smooth map such\nthat Dφy : TMy → TSn\nis an isomorphism for all y. Then φ is bijective\nφ(y)\n(one-to-one and onto).\nDefinition 30.6. A hypersurface M is convex if for all y ∈ M, the whole\nof M lies on one side of the hyperplane y + TMy.\nWe already know from Example 14.2 that if M is compact connected and\nconvex, its principal curvatures any any point are either ≥ 0 (for the orien\ntation pointing inwards) or ≤ 0 (for the orientation pointing outwards).\nTheorem 30.7 (Hadamard). Let M ⊂ Rn+1 , n ≥ 2, be a compact connected\nhypersurface, whose Gauss curvature is everywhere nonzero. Then M is\nconvex.\n\nRemark 30.8. For a compact connected hypersurface M ⊂ Rn+1 , n ≥ 2, the\nfollowing are equivalent: (i) the Gauss curvature is everywhere nonzero; (ii)\nthe Riemann curvature operator has only positive eigenvalues everywhere;\n(ii) the principal curvatures are either everywhere > 0 or everywhere < 0.\n\nX\nX\nq\nR\nP\nLecture 31\nLet M ⊂ Rn+1 be a compact hypersurface, and φ : M\nR a smooth\n→\nfunction. We want to quickly sketch the definition of the integral of φ. Recall\nthat the support supp(φ) ⊂ M is the closure of the set of points where φ is\nnonzero. First suppose that φ has small support, which means that supp(φ)\nis contained in the image of a partial parametrization f : U\nM, and write\nφf = φ * f : U → R\nZ\n. In that case,\nZ\nq\n→\ndef\nφ(y) dvoly =\nφf\ndet(Gf ) dx,\nM\nU\nThis makes sense because it's invariant under diffeomorphisms. For general\nφ, there are two equivalent ways: either write it as φ = φ1 +\n+ φm where\n· · ·\neach φi has small support.

The volume of M is defined as vol(M) = M 1dvol.\nLet M, M be hypersurfaces in Rn+1 , and φ : M\nM a smooth map.\n→\nSuppose that both our hypersurfaces come with Gauss normal vectors ν, ν .\nWe then define det(Dφy) by writing Dφy : TMy → TM φ(y) in terms of\northonormal bases of those vector spaces which are compatible with the\norientation. This means:\nDefinition 31.3. In the situation above, let (X1, . . . , Xn) be a basis of TMy\nsuch that det(X1, . . . , Xn, ν(y)) > 0, and (Y1, . . . , Yn) a basis of TM φ(y) such\nthat det(Y1, . . . , Yn, ν (φ(y))) > 0. Take the matrix A such that Dφy(Xi) =\nAjiYj , and define det(Dφy) = det(A). This is independent of the choices\nj\nof bases.\n\nExample 31.4.

Suppose that φ is bijective (one-to-one and\nonto), and that det(Dφ) is everywhere positive (or everywhere negative).\nThen deg(φ) = 1 (or -1).\nTheorem 32.5 (No proof). The degree is always an integer.\n\nZ\nZ\nX\nLecture 33\nExample 33.1. Let M ⊂ R3 be a torus, parametrized by\nf(x1, x2) = ((cos x1)(2 + cos x2), (sin x1)(2 + cos x2), sin x2)\nIn this parametrization, the first fundamental form is\n(2 + cos x2)2 0\nG =\n,\nhence\n√\ndet G = 2 + cos x2 and\nvol(M) = 8π2 .\nTake the map φ : M\nM which wraps the torus twice around itself, sending\n→\nf(x1, x2) to f(2x1, x2). Then det(Dφ) = 2 everywhere, hence deg(φ) = 2.\nNow consider the map φ : M\nM wrapping the other way, which means\n→\nthat it sends f(x1, x2) to f(x1, 2x2). With respect to the orthonormal basis\n(∂x1 f/(2 + cos x2), ∂x2 f), we have\n2+cos 2x2\nDφ f(x1,x2)\n2+cos x2\n=\n,\nhence det(Dφ )f(x1,x2) = 41+cos x2 , and\n2+cos x2\ndet(Dφ ) dvol =\n4(1 + cos x2) = 16π2 ,\nM\n[0,2π]×[0,2π]\nwhich means that again deg( φ ) = 2. One can get the same integral formula\na little more easily by using Proposition 26.3.\nSince the degree is an integer, it is constant under smooth deformations of\na map. By applying this idea (called the homotopy method), we get:\nLemma 33.2. Let M ⊂ Rn+1 be a compact hypersurface with a Gauss map,\nand φ : M → Sn a smooth map. If deg(φ) = 0, then\nφ is necessarily onto.\nThe result generalizes to targets other than Sn, and there is an even more\ngeneral formula:\nTheorem 33.3 (no proof). Let M, M ⊂ Rn+1 be compact connected hy\npersurfaces with orientations, and φ : M\nM a smooth map. Suppose\n→\nthat p ∈ M is a point with the following properties: (i) there are only\nfinitely many y1, . . . , yk ∈ M such that φ(yi) = p; (ii) at each yi, we have\ndet(Dφyi ) = 0. Then\nk\ndeg(φ) =\nsign(det(Dφyi )).\ni=1\n\nZ\nDefinition 33.4. Let M be a compact hypersurface with an orientation.\nThe total Gauss curvature is\nκtot\ngauss =\nκgauss dvol.\nM\nFor even-dimensional hypersurfaces, the choice of orientation is actually ir\nrelevant. If we take φ = ν : M\nSn to be the Gauss map, and orient Sn\n→\npointing outwards, then det(Dφy) = det(-Ly) = (-1)nκgauss, hence:\nCorollary 33.5. Let M be a compact hypersurface with an orientation.\nThen\nκtot\n= (-1)nvol(Sn) deg(ν).\ngauss\nIn particular, the total Gauss curvature is always an integer multiple of\nvol(Sn).\n\np\nP\nLecture 34\nWe already saw that if M ⊂ R3 is a torus, then κtot\n= 0, irrespective of\ngauss\nhow it's embedded. To generalize this to other surfaces, we need to return\nto our discussion of moving frames.\nDefinition 34.1. Let f : U\nR3 be a surface patch, whose domain con\n→\ntains the origin. Let (X1, X2) be a moving frame defined on U \\ {0}. We\nsay that the frame has a singularity of multiplicity m ∈ Z at 0 if it can be\nwritten as\nX1 = cos(mθ)X 1 - sin(mθ)X 2,\nX2 = sin(mθ)X 1 + cos(mθ)X 2\nwhere θ is the angular coordinate, and ( X 1, X 2) is a moving frame which\nextends smoothly over x = 0. Passing to the matrices whose column vectors\nare the Xk and X k, one can write the relation as\nX = X exp(mθJ),\nwhere J =\n-\n1 as usual.\nLet X be a moving frame with a singularity of order m. Last time we\nconsidered the vector field\nα = ((A1)12, (A2)12) : U \\ {0} → R2 ,\nwhich was such that curl(α) = κgauss\ndet(G). A computation shows that\nα = m(x2, -x1)/kxk2 + something bounded in x,\nand therefore:\nLemma 34.2.\nI\nlim\nρ\nα = -2πm.\n→\n|x|=ρ\nDefinition 34.3. Let M ⊂ R3 be a compact surface. A moving frame with\nsingularities is given by a finite set of points {p1, . . . , pk} on M, together\nwith maps Y1, Y2 : M \\ {p1, . . . , pk} → R3 which at each point y form a\npositively oriented orthonormal basis of TM, and such that around each pk\nthere is a partial parametrization in which Yj = Df(Xj ) for some frame\nwith singularity of order m(pi) at p.\nTheorem 34.4 (no proof). Moving frames with singularities always exist.\nMoreover, for any choice of such frame, the sum\ni m(pi) is the same. It\nagrees with a topological invariant of M, called the Euler characteristic\nχ(M).\nThe torus has Euler characteristic 0. More interestingly, the sphere has\nEuler characteristic 2.\n\nR\nCorollary 34.5 (Gauss-Bonnet theorem; sketch proof). For any compact\nsurface M ⊂ R3 , κtot\n= 2π χ(M).\ngauss\n·\nCorollary 34.6. The Gauss map ν of a compact surface M ⊂ R3 satisfies\nχ(M) = 2 deg(ν). In particular, χ(M) is always even.\nThere is also a direct topological proof of this, avoiding curvature. Note that\nthere exist abstract compact surfaces (compact topological spaces locally\nhomeomorphic to R2) with odd Euler characteristic, but those do not admit\norientations, hence cannot be realized inside R3 .\nCorollary 34.7 (sketch proof). For any compact surface M ⊂ R3 , M kκkdvolM ≥\n4π.\n\nX\nP\nLecture 35\nThe Euler characteristic χ(M) is defined for all sufficiently nice topological\nspaces, and in particular for compact hypersurfaces M of any dimension. It\nis an intrinsic quantity (a homeomorphism invariant). We do not give the\ndefinition here, except to mention that if M admits a moving frame without\nany singularities, then the Euler characteristic is zero.\nTheorem 35.1 (Hopf; no proof). Let M ⊂ Rn+1 be a closed hypersurface of\neven dimension n, and ν : M\nSn a Gauss map. Then deg(ν) = χ(M)/2.\n→\nCorollary 35.2 (Generalized Gauss-Bonnet). In the same situation as\nabove, κtot\n= χ(M)vol(Sn)/2.\ngauss\nNo such result exists for odd n, which means that κtot\nis not intrinsic in\ngauss\nthose dimensions (it depends on how the hypersurface sits in Rn+1).\nDefinition 35.3. A compact combinatorial surface consists of a finite col\nlection {Pi} of flat convex polygons in R3, with the following properties:\nany two Pi are either disjoint or share a common edge; (ii) any edge of any\ngiven Pi belongs to precisely one other Pj , j =6\ni.\nS\nWe usually think of M =\nPi as the surface. Write {Ej } for the set\ni\nof edges, and {Vk} for the set of vertices. The combinatorial Gauss map\nassigns to each Pi a normal vector ν(Pi) ∈ S2, uniquely determined by the\nrequirement that it should point outwards (if M is connected, this means\npointing into the component of R3 \\ M which is not bounded). For each\nedge Ej we then get a great circle segment ν(Ej ) ⊂ S2 connecting the\nnormal vectors associated to its endpoints. Similarly, for each vertex Vk we\nget a \"region\" ν(Vk) ⊂ S2 whose boundaries are the great circle segments\nassociated to the edges adjacent to each vertex. The combinatorial Gauss\ncurvature is the spherical area\nκcomb (Vk) = \"area(ν(Vk))\".\ngauss\nThis has to be approached with some care, since the \"region\" can have self-\noverlaps, and the area should be counted with sign. In the case of a convex\nvertex, one really gets the ordinary positive area. More generally, one can\nuse some spherical trigonometry to get\nκcomb (Vk) = 2π -\nangles of corners adjacent to our vertex,\ngauss\nwhere the angles are counted with signs. Define the Euler characteristic to\nbe χ(M) = #polygons -#edges+#vertices (for a polygonal approximation\nof a smooth surface, this agrees with our previous definition). By applying\nspherical trigonometry, one obtains\nκcomb\nTheorem 35.4 (combinatorial Gauss-Bonnet; sketch proof).\nk\ngauss(Vk) =\n2πχ(M)."

Straight lines are distinguished by\nbeing the shortest lines joining two points. More precisely,\nLemma 36.1. Let γ : [a, b]\nRn be a smooth path, with γ(a) = p and\nR→\nb\nγ(b) = q. Its length L(γ) = a kγ0(t)k dt is ≥kq - pk, and equality holds iff\nγ0(t) is always a nonnegative multiple of q - p.\nStraight lines also appear in mechanics, from three equivalent viewpoints:\n- From a Newtonian point of view, a unit mass particle moves ac\ncording to x00(t) = F . If the force F vanishes, the solution γ(t) is\na constant speed straight line.\nFrom a Lagrangian point of view, the straight line comes about be\n-\nR b\ncause we are trying to minimize the Lagrange functional a L(x, x0) dt.\nFor free motion L(x, x0) = 1\n2 kx0k2, which produces the same equa\ntions of motion as before (this viewpoint is closely related to length\nminimization).\n- From the Hamiltonian (conjugate variable) point of view, the par\nticle position and momentum (x(t), p(t)) satisfy x0\ni(t) = ∂pi H(x, p),\np0\ni(t) = -∂xi H(x, p). In the free case the Hamiltonian is H(x, p) =\n2 .\n2 kpk\nDefinition 36.2. Let M ⊂ Rn+1 be a hypersurface. A smooth map γ : I →\nM, where I ⊂ R is an interval, is called a geodesic if γ00(t) is perpendicular\nto TMγ(t) for all t.\nRemember that γ0(t) ∈ TMγ(t), essentially by definition of tangent space.\nGeodesics are curves held to M by a constraint force.\nLemma 36.3. If γ is a geodesic, the speed kγ0(t)k is constant.\nProposition 36.4. Let f : U\nRn+1 be a partial parametrization of M,\n→\nand c : I\nU a smooth curve on its domain. Then γ = f(c) is a geodesic\n→\niff c itself satisfies the geodesic equation\nd2ck\nX\ndci dcj\n+\nΓk\n= 0.\ndt2\nij dt dt\nij\nImportantly, this equation contains only intrinsic quantities.\nCorollary 36.5 (proof sketched). Two geodesics γ, γ : I\nM with γ(0) =\nγ (0) and γ0(0) = γ0(0) agree.\n→\nCorollary 36.6 (proof sketched). Given any point y ∈ M and any tangent\nvector Y ∈ TMy, there is an interval I ⊂ R containing 0 and a geodesic\n\nγ : I\nR such that γ(0) = y, γ0(0) = Y . If M is a closed subset of Rn+1 ,\n→\none can take I = R, which means that geodesics are defined for all times.\nExamples 36.7. (i) The nontrivial geodesics on Sn are just the great circles,\nparametrized with arbitrary constant speed. More explicitly, take u, v ∈ Sn\nwhich are orthogonal to each other, and write γ(t) = cos(αt)u + sin(αt)v,\nwhere α ∈ R is any constant.\n(ii) Take the infinite cylinder M = {x ∈ R3 : x2\n2 + x3\n2 = 1}. Geodesics on\nthis are just spirals, γ(t) = (a1t + b1, cos(a2t + b2), sin(a2t + b2)).\n(iii) If the hypersurface M contains a straight line, that straight line is a\ngeodesic.\n\nLecture 37\nExample 37.1. Let M ⊂ R3 be a surface which is invariant under the\nreflection x 7→ (x1, x2, -x3), and is not contained in the plane x3 = 0. Then\nany path in M which is contained in the plane x3 = 0 and parametrized\nwith constant speed, is a geodesic.\nExample 37.2. Let M ⊂ R3 be a surface of rotation, parametrized by\nf(x1, x2) = (l1(x1) cos x2, l1(x1) sin x2, l2(x1)), where l is a unit speed curve\nin the plane. Then the geodesic equation is\nc00\n1(t) - l1(c1)l1\n0 (c1)c0\n2(t)2 = 0,\nc2\n00(t) + 2 l\nl\n(\n(\nx\nc1\n)\n)c0\n1(t)c0\n2(t) = 0.\nParticular solutions are where x2 is constant, or where x1 is constant at a\nvalue where l1\n0 (x1) = 0.\nConsider a hypersurface M ⊂ Rn+1, but where now Rn+1 carries the Minkowski\ninner product. We assume that M is space-like, which means that the re\nstriction of h·, ·iMin to TMy is positive definite for all y. A geodesic is then\na curve γ(t) such that γ00(t) is Minkowski-orthogonal to TMγ(t) for all t. In\na local parametrization, this satisfies the same geodesic equation as before.\nConsider the hyperbolic plane H2 = {x1 > 0, hx, xiMin = -x1\n2 + x2\n2 + x3\n2 =\n-1}. Take two vectors u, v ∈ R3 which satisfy u1 > 0, hu, uiMin = -1,\nhv, viMin = +1, hu, viMin = 0. Then\nγ(t) = cosh(αt)u + sinh(αt)v\nfor any α ∈ R, is a geodesic, and these are all the geodesic on the hyperbolic\nplane. If α = 0, the image of\nγ is just the intersection of Hn with the plane\nspanned by u, v. Note that unlike the sphere, non-constant geodesic go to\ninfinity as t →inf.\nIf we parametrize projective space as in the Klein or projective ball model,\nthe geodesics become straight line segments (their speed, obviously, is not\nconstant). In the parametrization by the Poincar e ball model, they become\ncircle segments which intersect the boundary of ball perpendicularly (on, in\nthe limiting case, a line segment through the center of our ball).\n\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nLecture 38\nThis lecture covers the \"Lagrangian\" and \"Hamiltonian\" viewpoints on\ngeodesics, each of which is important in its own right. Let M ⊂ Rn+1\nbe a hypersurface, and γ : [a, b]\nM a path. We define its energy to be\n→\n1 Z b\nE(γ) =\nkγ0(t)k2 dt.\n2 a\nThen the following variational principle holds:\nTheorem 38.1 (proof sketched). A curve γ : [a, b]\nM is a geodesic if and\n→\nonly if the following holds. For any smooth family of paths (γs), - < s < ,\nwith the same endpoints γs(a) = p, γs(b) = q and with γ0 = γ, we have\n= 0.\n∂ E(γs)\n∂s\ns=0\nCorollary 38.2. A path which is an absolute minimizer of the energy\n(over all paths γ : [a, b]\nM with fixed endpoints γ(a) = p, γ(b) = q), is\nnecessarily a geodesic.\n→\nNote that the converse to the Corollary does not hold. There are geodesics\n(on the sphere, for instance) which are not absolute energy minimizers.\nTheorem 38.3 (no proof). Suppose that M is closed and connected. Then,\nfor any given p, q and any interval [a, b], there is a geodesic γ : [a, b]\nM\nwhich is an absolute minimizer of the energy.\n→\nThis provides a practical way of finding geodesics numerically, by applying\nsome minimization method to the energy functional.\nNow consider a partial parametrization f : U\nRn+1 of M, and its associ\n→\nated first fundamental form G = (gij ). In this local coordinate system, the\ngeodesic equations (using the intrinsic formula for Christoffel symbols) can\nbe written as\n=\ngklx00\nl\nx0\nix0\nj ∂xl gij -\nx0\nix0\nj ∂xi gjl.\nk\nij\nij\nDecoupling them by introducing new variables v1, . . . , vn yields\nx0\nk = vk,\ngklvl\n0 = 2\nvivj ∂xl gij -\nvivj ∂xi gjl.\nk\nij\nij\n\nP\nP\nProposition 38.4.

The length of a path γ : [a, b] → M is\nZ b\nL(γ) =\nkγ0(t)k dt.\na\nDefine the distance dist(p, q) = infγ L(γ), where the infimum is taken over\nall paths from p to q.\nLemma 39.1. If M is a connected hypersurface, then (M, dist) is a metric\nspace. By this we mean that it satisfies the following axioms:\ndist(p, q) ≥ 0, with equality if and only if p = q.\ndist(p, q) = dist(q, p),\ndist(p, q) ≤ dist(p, r) + dist(r, q).\nProposition 39.2 (part of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality; no proof). Let\nf : [a, b]\nR be a function. Then\n→\ns\nZ b\nZ b\nf(t) dt ≤\n√\nb - a\nf(t)2 dt,\na\na\nwith equality if and only if f is constant.\nCorollary 39.3. For any path γ : [a, b] → M, we have L(γ) ≤ 21/2(b -\na)1/2E(γ)1/2, with equality if and only if γ has constant speed.\nCorollary 39.4. If we fix the endpoints γ(a) = p, γ(b) = q, a path is an\nabsolute energy-minimizer if and only if it is an absolute length-minimizer\nand is parametrized with constant speed.\nCorollary 39.5. Let M be a closed connected hypersurface. Then, for any\ntwo points p, q there is a path γ connecting them, such that L(γ) = dist(p, q).\nIn other words, the infimum in the definition of distance is always attained.\nGiven a parametrization f : U\nM with first fundamental form I, one can\ndefine the lengths of paths c : [\n→\na, b]\nU to be equal to the length of their\nimage γ = f(c). Concretely,\n→\nZ b q\nL(c) =\nIc(t)(c0(t), c0(t)) dt.\na\nAs before, there is an associated notion of distance. As an example, consider\nthe Poincar e parametrization of the hyperbolic plane. We identify R2 = C,\nwith one complex coordinate z = x1 + ix2, so that U = {z ∈ C , |z| < 1}.\nThen\nG(z) =\n( 1 0 ) .\n(1 -|z|2)2\n0 1\n\nLemma 39.6 (partial proof). For z, w ∈ U, the distance in the hyperbolic\nmetric is\ndist(z, w) = 2arctanh |z - w| .\nwz - 1|\n|\nThere is an interesting connection with complex geometry.\nTheorem 39.7. (Schwarz-Pick) Let h : U\nU be a holomorphic (complex\n→\ndifferentiable) function. Then at every point z ∈ U,\n|h0(z)| ≤ 1\n-\n-\n|h\n|\n(\nz\nz\n|\n)\n|2\n.\nCorollary 39.8. For h as before,\nIh(z)(Dh(z)X, Dh(z)X) ≤ Iz(X, X).\nCorollary 39.9. Any holomorphic function h : U\nU is distance-non\nincreasing for the hyperbolic metric: dist(h(p), h(q)) ≤\n→\ndist(p, q).\n\nLecture 40\nLet (X, d) be a metric space. This means that X is a set, and d : X ×X → R\na function satisfying the three axioms from the last lecture. In particular,\nthis allows one to define continuous functions, maps, etc.\nDefinition 40.1. A continuous path γ : [a, b]\nX is called a metric geo\ndesic if d(γ(s), γ(t)) = |s - t| for all s, t ∈ [a, b].\n→\nExample 40.2. In the traditional case of hypersurfaces, metric geodesics\nare precisely unit speed geodesics which are absolute distance-minimizers.\nA metric space is called geodesic if any two points can be joined by a metric\ngeodesic.\nDefinition 40.3. Let X be a geodesic metric space. X is called nonpos\nitively curved in the sense of Busemann (or a Busemann space) if it has\nthe following property. Whenever γ1, γ2 : [0, l]\nX are metric geodesics\n→\nstarting at the same point γ1(l) = γ2(l), then we have\nd(γ1(t), γ2(t)) ≤ (t/l) d(γ1(l), γ2(l)).\nExample 40.4. Euclidean space Rn, as well as hyperbolic space Hn, are\nnonnegatively curved in the sense of Busemann. For the latter, the distance\nfunction along two geodesics with the same starting point is\nd(γ1(t), γ2(t)) = α arctanh(1/ tanh(t)).\nfor some constant α, which is a convex function.\nExample 40.5. Any metrized tree is nonnegatively curved in the sense of\nBusemann.\nExample 40.6. A combinatorial surface in R3 is Busemann if and only if it\nis topologically simply-connected (any continuous loop can be filled in by a\ncontinuous disc), and the total angle at any vertex is ≥ 2π.\nLemma 40.7. Any two points in a Busemann space are joined by a unique\nmetric geodesic.\nThere is also a stronger and more useful notion, due to Alexandrov. For\nany geodesic triangle Δ in X with corners p, q, r, consider the comparison\ntriangle Δ0 in R2 with corners p0, q0, r0, characterized by having sides of the\nsame length: d(p, q) = kp0 - q0k, d(p, r) = kp0 - r0k, d(q, r) = kq0 - r0k. For\nany point on any of the sides of Δ, there is a unique corresponding point\nof Δ0, characterized by having the same distance from the two adjacent\ncorners.\nDefinition 40.8. Let X be a geodesic metric space. X is called nonpos\nitively curved in the sense of Cartan-Alexandrov-Topogonov (or an CAT\n\nspace) if for all Δ, Δ0 and all points x, y on the boundary of Δ, with com\nparison points x0, y0, we have dist(x, y) ≤ dist(x0, y0).\nAll examples listed above are in fact CAT (which implies Busemann). There\nare also important local versions of all the notions in this lecture, where the\nconditions are assumed to hold only locally (\"for every point x ∈ X there\nexists an open subset U ⊂ X containing x, such that...\").\nReferences: Burago-Burago-Ivanov, A course in metric geometry; Bridson-\nHaefliger, Metric spaces of non-positive curvature; Papadopoulos, Metric\nspaces, convexity, and nonpositive curvature.\n\nZ\nZ\nZ\nLecture 41\nLet M ⊂ R3 be a surface, with a Gauss map ν : M → S2 . Suppose that\nγ : I → M is a regular curve, which as usual means γ0(t) = 0 for all\nt ∈ I.\nDefinition 41.1. The geodesic curvature of γ is defined by\nκgeod(t) = det(γ0(t), γ00(t), ν(γ(t))) .\nkγ0(t)k3\nThe geodesic curvature is reparametrization invariant. If M = R2 ×{0} with\nν(x1, x2, 0) = (0, 0, 1), it specializes to the ordinary curvature of a plane\ncurve. On the other hand, if we only look at curves which are parametrized\nwith constant speed. Then κgeod vanishes identically iff γ is a geodesic.\nSuppose that we have, at each point of M, a positively oriented orthonormal\nbasis (Y1(y), Y2(y), Y3(y)) such that Y3 = ν everywhere, and Y1(γ(t)) =\nγ0(t)/kγ0(t)k. Then\nκgeod(t) = hY2(γ(t)), (d/dt)Y1(γ(t))i.\nkγ0(t)k\nLemma 41.2. Take a partial parametrization f : U → M ⊂ R3 which\nis compatible with our choice of orientation, and let γ = f(c). Suppose\nthat we have a moving frame (X1(x), X2(x)) which is positively oriented,\nand such that X1(c(t)) = c0(t)/Ic(t)(c0(t), c0(t))1/2 . Then, in terms of the\nassociated connection matrices,\nκgeod(t) = (A1)12c0\n1(t) + (A2)12c0\n2(t) .\nIc(t)(c0(t), c0(t))1/2\nTheorem 41.3 (Gauss-Bonnet with boundary, for discs; proof sketched).\nLet M ⊂ R3 be a surface, and f : U → M a partial parametrization, and\nD ⊂ U a curvilinear disc. Take the simple closed curve c which parametrizes\nthe boundary of D, and consider the total geodesic curvature of γ = f(c).\nThis satisfies\nκtot =\nκgeod(t)Ic(t)(c0(t), c0(t))1/2 dt = 2π -\nκgauss\n√\ndet G dx,\ngeod\nD\nwhere G is the first fundamental form.\nFor a more general domain with boundary S ⊂ M, one gets an equality\nκtot = 2πχ(S) -\ndvol.\ngeod\nκgauss\nS\nMore classical is the case of a geodesic triangle with corners:\n\nZ\nCorollary 41.4 (proof sketched). Let M ⊂ R3 be a surface, f : U → M a\npartial parametrization, and T ⊂ U a curvilinear triangle, whose sides map\nto geodesics in M. Let α1, α2, α3 be the angles at the corners of the triangle,\nmeasured with respect to the first fundamental form. Then\nα1 + α2 + α3 = π +\nκgauss\n√\ndet G dx.\nT"
