  "syllabus_content": "Course Meeting Times\n\nLectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session\n\nCourse Overview\n\nIntroduction to Transportation Systems has two major goals:\n\nTo teach an understanding of the world of traveler and freight transportation:\n\nHow it works and how to think about analyzing and designing transportation systems?\n\nTo teach an appreciation of the multi-dimensionality of transportation issues, emphasizing:\n\nTechnology\n\nSystems\n\nInstitutions\n\nand how transportation fits into a broader social/political/economic context involving:\n\nEnvironmental Issues\n\nEnergy Issues\n\nEconomic Development\n\nSustainability\n\nUrban Structure\n\nLand Use\n\nEquity\n\nEtc.\n\nThe subject focuses on fundamental principles of transportation systems, introduces transportation systems components and networks, and addresses how one invests in and operates them effectively. The tie between transportation and related systems is emphasized.\n\nWe discuss operating characteristics of various modes and intermodal combinations (transportation supply) and offer a perspective on \"customers\" (e.g., freight shippers, travelers) of transportation services and how they make transportation decisions (transportation demand).\n\nWe introduce quantitative modeling ideas and various techniques and philosophies of modeling complex transportation enterprises. Also, conceptual \"frameworks\" for qualitative analysis are introduced (e.g., framework for strategic regional planning, institutional change analysis, new technology development and deployment).\n\n1.201J/11.545J/ESD.210J strives to be an interdisciplinary systems subject in the \"open\" sense. We look at transportation as a CLIOS (complex, large-scale, interconnected, open sociotechnical) system, where \"interconnected\" suggests transportation is linked to many other related societal systems, and recognize the broad impact of transportation system design and deployment decisions.\n\n1.201J/11.545J/ESD.210J is required for all first-year Master of Science in Transportation students. It would be of interest to, as well as accessible to, students in Urban Studies and Planning, Political Science, Technology and Policy, Management, and various engineering departments. It is a good subject for those who plan to take only one subject in transportation and serves as an entry point to other transportation subjects as well.\n\nWhile conducted as a graduate subject, motivated undergraduates interested in transportation and a broad perspective on large-scale systems are welcome.\n\nGrading\n\nACTIVITIES\n\nPERCENTAGES\n\nAssignments\n\n60%\n\nFinal Exam\n\n30%\n\nClass Participation\n\n10%\n\nWe have six assignments, spread out over the semester. Assignments are of unequal weight, reflecting the amount of work for each.\n\nAcademic Honesty\n\nThe Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering adheres to the strictest standards of academic honesty. An important aspect of achieving these standards is to be sure that students are aware of expectations of faculty as regards academic honesty. This statement clarifies the faculty's expectations in 1.201J/11.545J/ESD.210J.\n\nAssignments\n\nAssignments performed by students for submission have a dual purpose. They are intended as educational devices, including the teaching of skills such as working in teams. They are also evaluation tools for the faculty in judging the quality of performance of individual students. Our policies are intended to balance these two purposes and, unless otherwise stated, these policies apply to all assignments.\n\nStudents\ncurrently\ntaking this class can work together to conceptualize general approaches to assignments. However, unless otherwise specified for a particular assignment, the work you submit should be done completely on your own. This includes text, numerical calculations, mathematical derivations, diagrams, graphs, computer programs and output.\n\nReference any written source you use in your submission, including Web sites.\n\nIt is inappropriate to use assignments submitted in previous years as a source.\n\nIn-Class Exams\n\nAll work on in-class exams should be performed only by you. Materials you can bring into the examination will be specified by the faculty for each exam.",

The overall\nintent is to give you an in-depth experience with a particular transportation\nconcept -The US Interstate System- and its relationship to other transportation\nsystems and societal issues.\nLecture 4 will be devoted in large part to a class discussion of the US Interstate\nSystem. In preparation, we ask you to read the R6 papers under Additional\nReadings listed in the syllabus. Then in Assignment 2A, we ask you to write\nseveral short responses, to be handed in at the beginning of Lecture 4. Think of it\nas a \"ticket of admission\" to Lecture 4.

Both members on the team should work collaboratively on all\nparts of the assignment. Dividing the work and working separately on different\nquestions or different parts of questions is not appropriate. Both team members will be\nresponsible for the final answers.\n\nQuestion 3A (60%)\n\nConsider the following urban travel choice situation: MIT students are attending a subject taught\nat the Kennedy School of Government in the spring semester which meets Tuesday and\nThursday mornings from 10:30 to noon. These students do not have access to\nautomobiles and in any case would be unable to park close to the Kennedy School in mid-\nmorning so their choices for getting to and from the Harvard class are:\n\n1. Access MBTA bus route #1, alight at Harvard Square, and walk from there to the\nKennedy School.\n2. Walk to Kendall Square, take the MBTA Red Line to Harvard and walk from there.\n3. Walk from MIT to the Kennedy School.\n\nA recent study has estimated the following utility function for mode choice which could be\napplied to this choice scenario:\n\nCOST\nWT\nTA\nIVTT\nVi\n*\n.2\n*\n.0\n*\n.0\n*\n.0\n-\n-\n-\n-\n=\n\nIVTT: In-vehicle travel time (minutes)\nTA: Access or walk time (minutes)\nWT: Wait time (minutes)\nCOST: Fare (dollars)\n\nNote:\n1) Mean in-vehicle travel times (IVTT) and wait times (WT) were used to estimate this utility\nfunction.\n2) The shape parameter in the logit function μ, is 1.0\n\nData has been analyzed to derive the following level of service attributes for the relevant services\nat the time of day on interest:\n\nFunction A: PDF of in-vehicle travel time (IVTT) for MBTA bus route #1\n\n0.2\nProbability\nMinutes\n\nFunction B: PDF of wait time for MBTA bus route #1\n\nProbability\nMinutes\n0.1\n\nFunction C: PDF of in-vehicle travel time (IVTT) for MBTA Red Line\n\n0.4\nProbability\nMinutes\n\nFunction D: PDF of wait time for MBTA Red Line\n\n0.2\nProbability\nMinutes\n\nAnswer the following questions: (all questions have equal credit: 7.5%)\n\n1. What are the choice probabilities for each of the three defined alternatives above? Make\nall necessary assumptions, including walking travel times and state them clearly.\n2. How do the choice probabilities change if a student has\na. An MBTA Rail monthly pass?\nb. An MBTA Bus monthly pass?\nc. An MBTA Bus/Rail Combo monthly pass?\n(Note: a pass means that you can ride as many times as you want once you have\nbought the pass)\n3. How do the choice probabilities change if the MBTA adopts a new fare structure of $1.75\nfor both bus and rail?\n4. What are the departure times and route choice probabilities if the student must be on time\n(i.e. arrive with probability 1 at or before the start of class)?\n5. Critically access the utility function given above.\n6. Are there likely to be any equilibrium effects which might affect this particular problem -\nin other words is the performance of the services likely to be sensitive to the choices?\n7. Which of these alternatives would you choose and explain why?\n8. What would you expect the overall share of trips for these alternatives for a set of\nstudents facing these choices, and explain why?\n\nQuestion 3B (40%)\n\nRegulatory Effects on Carrier Costs & Decisions: in a regulated transportation system, a public\nagency often determines whether or not to grant operating authority to additional firms to serve a\nparticular market. In such a system operating authorities can have substantial value, because\nthey tend to limit competition and allow carriers to make a reasonable return on their investment.\nIn such a system, a company may decide if it no longer wants to serve a market. It might then be\nable to sell its operating authority (just the piece of paper - not any equipment or facilities!) for a\nconsiderable sum of money, as illustrated in this example. The new operator can then determine\nhow best to serve the market.\n\n(All questions have equal credit: 10%)\n\n1. The year is 1970 and your father would very much like to enter the highly profitable\ntrucking market between Boston and New York. He figures that he could transport\napples and fresh fish using refrigerated trucks from Boston to New York, a distance of\nroughly 200 miles, for a cost of $1/mile loaded (for either commodity) and $0.75/mile for\nthe empty return trip. Current transportation rates, which have been approved by a\nregulatory process, are $500 per truckload for fresh fish and $600 per truckload for\napples. He would like to start with a small operation involving 5 trucks, which he can buy\nfor $50,000 each. With an operation of this size, he expects that he would easily be able\nto obtain enough loads to keep his trucks busy making roughly 125 2-day round-trips per\nyear each. However, he needs regulatory approval to enter this market, and the Interstate\nCommerce Commission believes that there is no need for additional carriers. Hence, his\nonly option is to buy the operating authority from another carrier. Assuming that all of his\nassumptions are correct, how much should he be willing to pay for this authority given\nthat he would like to make a good return on his investment of $250,000 for the five\ntrucks?\n\n2. Now it is 1985 and trucking has been deregulated. Your father eventually did acquire the\nnecessary operating rights (for much less than he was willing to pay), and quickly\nbecame rich sending fish and apples to the Big Apple (American slang for New York\nCity). He retired in 1978, leaving the company to your elder brother to manage. Almost\nimmediately, however, deregulation of the transport rates for fresh food drastically\nchanged the trucking business, allowing almost anyone with a truck to enter the business.\nYour brother, who lacked the benefit of an MIT education (which you are fortunate\nenough to have), responded too slowly, and barely avoided bankruptcy. He has laid off\nall of his employees and sold all but one of his trucks. He would like to try to make a\nliving as an owner-operator (driving the truck himself), using the one, nearly brand new\ntruck that he managed to salvage from the financial disaster. He tells you that the cause\nof his problems was that the market rates for transporting fresh fish and apples dropped to\n$400 per truckload, while operating costs of refrigerated trucks rose to $1.50/mile loaded\nand $1.00/mile empty.\n\nThe most recent statistics from the company showed that variable costs (fuel, tolls,\nservicing, meals, lodging, and maintenance) accounted for half of the average costs,\n\nwhile the remainder was used to cover equipment ownership costs and drivers' wages.\nYour brother says that since he already owns his truck, he can earn $0.75/mile on the\nloaded trip and $0.50/mile on the empty trip, which would amount to nearly $40,000 per\nyear, which would be plenty for him to live on, since his wife divorced him and took the\nkids when the trucking business started to fall apart. How much would your brother\nreally earn in his first year, if he continued operating in the same way that the firm had in\nthe past?\n\n3. After deflating your brother's expectations (and mentioning that he had forgotten about\nhis alimony payments of $1,000 per month to his ex-wife), you try to give him some\nadvice on how to improve his operation. In particular, you tell him that he needs to\nutilize his equipment more effectively, either by making more trips/year, by getting\nbackhauls (a loaded revenue-generating return trip) from New York to Boston, or by\ngetting into another market. To get a backhaul will require additional time and expense\nfor loading, unloading, and repositioning equipment. Write equations for i) the total cost\nof a round-trip from Boston to New York and ii) the time required. Using these\nequations, calculate for your brother the minimum amount he should accept for bringing\na load of pastrami back to Boston if the return trip requires 200 loaded miles, 50 empty\nmiles, and an extra day (3 rather than 2 days for the round-trip)?\n\n4. How would getting into another market (different O-D pairs or commodities) affect your\nbrother's prospects? What do you recommend that he do?"

We would prefer you find\ndifferent partners than you had on A3 and A4, but won't mandate that.\n\nTo set the stage, we quote from a New York Times article from October 23, 2006 titled\n\"Panamanians Vote Overwhelmingly to Expand Canal\"\n\n\"Panamanians on Sunday overwhelmingly endorsed the plan to modernize the country's\naging canal, won over by government arguments that the $5.25b project would generate\njobs and keep the canal relevant for future generations\"\n\n\"The overhaul to begin next year will double the canal's capacity by adding a third set of\nlocks that are 40% longer and 60% wider than the current ones constructed by the\nUnited States in 1914. The canal these days is congested and too small to handle the\nworld's largest container vessels and tankers.\"\n\nSince being constructed in 1914, the Panama Canal has proven to be a vital link in the\nglobal freight transportation system, facilitating transportation of freight between many\ncountries, and because of its strategic position, avoiding circuitous routes involving ships\ngoing around the southern tip of South America to access their destinations. The Canal\nhas been expanded and upgraded over time.\n\nConsider the following situation: you are a shipper in the New York metropolitan area on\nthe East Coast of the United States shipping containers to a customer in the Los Angeles\nmetropolitan area on the West Coast of the United States. You have four transportation\noptions:\n\n1. You can transport overland by truck\n2. You can transport overland using an intermodal combination of truck and rail\nusing a truck, rail, truck sequence\n\n3. You can transport using container ships that can use the current-day Panama Canal\nfrom the Port of New York and New Jersey to the Port of Long Beach.\n4. You can transport using the new larger container ships from the Port of New York\nand New Jersey to the Port of Long Beach. However, since these ships cannot pass\nthrough the current-day Panama Canal, they must travel around Cape Horn on the\nsouthern tip of South America in order to go from the East Coast of the U.S. to the West\nCoast.\n\nAssume that the shipper and the receiver have only truck access. For Options 3 and 4,\nassume a truck move is needed to move the containers from the shipper to the\ncontainerships and to the receiver from the containerships.\n\nPlease respond to the following questions, using the number of points for each to guide\nyour level of effort.\n\na) Discuss the way you would go about choosing among these four transportation options\nstating your results both in text and in a series of algebraic equations. You don't have to\nindicate your choice but rather just make clear how you would choose. You will have to\nmake various assumptions about the operation of these various transportation links and\nthe logistics systems of the shipper and receiver of the goods. Please document them\ncarefully. (3 points)\n\nb) Now suppose we fast forward ten years into the future, and the Panama Canal has been\nexpanded as planned. Now the larger ships of Option 4 can pass through the canal. This\nwill change some of the parameters in your algebraic equations from a) above. Discuss\nwhich ones will change and the direction of that change and the implications for your\nmode choice, reflecting the new realities of East Coast to West Coast freight\ntransportation services. Again, document any assumptions. (2 points)\n\nc) Now consider this from the point of view of the containership operator. Explain how\nthe expansion of the Panama Canal would impact on the fleet composition decisions the\nfleet owner would make. In this case, simply use text. Please note that, of course, the fleet\nowner has customers other than the one above and serves other origin-destination pairs.\n(1 point)"

      "content": "1.201J / 11.545J / ESD.210J Transportation Systems\n\nFALL 2006\n\nASSIGNMENT 6: Expanding the Panama Canal (Part A)\n\nDate assigned: November 17, 2006\nDate due: Friday, December 1, 2006\n\nValue: 10 points for Part A; 4 points for Part B\n\nAssignment 6 will have two parts.\n\nPart A addresses issues related to the capacity, performance, and demand for the Panama\nCanal. You have been assigned to a team of three to work on this assignment. The teams\nmay split up the work in whatever way they wish, and they must report how each\nmember contributed to the assignment. This is not a \"pull an all-nighter the day before it\nis due\" kind of assignment. You need to get your team organized quickly and work\nuniformly over the next two weeks to be successful.\n\nPart B is an individual assignment (to be handed out on November 28th). It will ask you\nto consider policy issues from the perspective of various actors based on the numerical\nresults you developed in Part A.\n\nBackground\n\nMap of t\nhe Panama C anal\nregio\nn.\nFigure by MIT OCW.\nBy 1990, the Panama Canal was operating close to capacity, and it was clear that major\ninvestments would be needed to keep pace with demand. The Canal, which had been\ndesigned for the largest ships envisioned at the beginning of the 20th century, was no\nlonger able to handle the largest ships afloat at the end of the century. While the Canal\ncertainly offered a cheaper and quicker route for many commodities and trade routes, it\nwas less attractive to others because of the added costs imposed by the Canal tolls, the\npotential for delays if the Canal were to become congested, and the restrictions on vessel\nsize.\n\nControl of the Panama Canal was to be transferred from the U.S. to Panama on December\n31, 1999. In preparing for the transfer, the Panama Canal Commission undertook a\n\nvariety of engineering and transportation systems studies to determine how best to\nrespond to the growing demand. While under U.S. control, the Canal had always been\noperated on a self-sufficient basis, i.e. the Panama Canal Commission (PCC) used\nrevenue from tolls to pay for operations and maintenance (approximately $250 million)\nand capital investment (also on the order of $200 million). It did not borrow any money\n(nor did it ever have to repay the U.S. government for the original cost of construction\npaid for by the U.S.). The annual revenue from tolls was also sufficient to make a $200\nmillion contribution to the Government of Panama (GOP) ($100 million per year in\n1990). U.S. policy sought to maintain a high level of service for users of the Canal\nwithout seeking to maximize either profits for the PCC or contribution to the GOP.\n\nThese policies would not necessarily be maintained once the PCC was controlled by\nPanama (and renamed the Panama Canal Authority (APC)). In particular, they would be\nable to borrow funds in order to increase the rate of investment, and they would be able to\nincrease the amount of money that went to the GOP. They would also be able to raise\ntolls or adopt schemes to auction capacity should congestion become a problem.\n\nIn this part of the assignment, your team is acting as an advisor to the PCC and the GOP.\nIt is 1993, and no major decisions have yet been made as to whether, when or how to\nexpand the capacity of the Canal. You have been asked to consider issues related to the\nsupply and demand for Canal services and to conduct analyses concerning the benefits\nand costs associated with various options for expanding the canal.\nTable 1 describes the existing performance of the Panama Canal as of the early 1990s.\nAt that time, the Canal was approaching capacity, as evidenced by increasing delays.\nWhile the minimum time required for a complete transit of the canal was 9 hours, the\naverage time was 12 hours. Projections indicated that average transit times would reach\n15-20 hours within a few years; during peak periods, transit times would exceed 32\nhours. Delays could be even worse during periods when lock maintenance was being\nperformed. Capacity of the canal was limited by three major factors:\n\n- The size of ships that could use the canal\n- The time required for one lock cycle (i.e. the time to raise or lower a ship or\nships1 in a lock)\n- The geometry of the Cut2, which was too narrow to allow bi-directional\noperations of Panamax vessels3.\n\nTable 1 also shows some statistics related to the option of using the US rail system as\na \"landbridge\" for containers moving from the Pacific Rim to points in the eastern\nUnited States. The \"landbridge\" option was very attractive for high-valued freight,\nand it captured 84% of the containerized trade between Japan, Taiwan and South\nKorea and the eastern US in the early 1990s.\n\n1 Each lock was large enough to hold two or more smaller vessels.\n2 The Cut is the 8-mile portion of the Canal that was excavated through the hills in Central Panama. The\nrest of the \"Canal\" crosses lakes or tidal inlets that are much wider than the Cut.\n3 A \"Panamax\" vessel is the largest that can move through the Canal. \"Post-Panamax\" vessels are too large\nto go through the Canal; they are attractive because they offer substantial economies in operation.\n\nTable 1: Base Case\n\nNumber of lanes for each\nset of locks\nNumber of locks per lane\nAverage time per lock\n50 minutes\nMinimum transit time\n9 hours\nAverage transit time\n12 hours\nTransits per year\n14,000\nTonnage per year\n170 million\nToll\n$3/ton\nTotal rail intermodal\nshipments per year in US\n7 million\nTime saved by using\nlandbridge\n5-10 days\nAdded cost of using\nlandbridge\n$200-500/container\n\nQuestion 1: Supply Analysis (3 points)\n\nVarious options were available for increasing the capacity of the Canal:\na. Upgrade the navigational system to include GPS and digital communications\nso that it would be possible to implement algorithms that would optimize the\nsequencing of ships through the locks and through the Cut.\nb. Replace and expand the fleet of PCC locomotives that are used to improve the\nefficiency of lock operations. The fleet was originally sized to maximize the\nutilization of the locomotives; expanding the fleet would allow operations to\nminimize the time required for each lock cycle.\nc. Widen the Cut to allow larger ships to pass and to operate 24 hours/day (two\nlarge ships need ample room to pass, especially at night; if there is not enough\nroom to pass, then the largest ships will be delayed so that they can be\nscheduled to move single file through the cut. This work can be staged first to\nallow Panamax ships, then to allow Post-Panamax ships. It is also possible to\nprovide one or more locations within the Cut where the ships can pass, which\nwould allow some capacity benefits before the entire Cut is widened.)\nd. Add a 3rd set of locks that would be large enough to handle the largest Post-\nPanamax ships\ne. Add a 4th set of locks\n\nSome of the major characteristics of these options are shown in Table 2. Some of these\noptions were expected to require only a year or two to implement, but major increases in\ncapacity would require many years to implement. The table also shows the approximate\noperating costs for the base case Canal and the added costs for operating additional locks\nor a new Canal.4 For these options, the time to implement is shown as a range between a\nminimum feasible time and an extended interval reflecting a decision to proceed more\nslowly with the projects (i.e. the range of times reflects options for the Canal Authority,\nnot a lack of precision in the estimates). Two numbers are also shown for capacity: the\nfirst represents the capacity assuming an average delay of 6 hours (and an average transit\ntime of 15 hours); the second represents an average delay of 10 hours. The numbers\nshown in the Table reflect the results of simulation analyses conducted for the PCC. The\nCanal is operated 24/7/365, and traffic volumes do not display any major daily, weekly,\nor seasonal peaks. The volume/delay curve therefore peaks sharply as traffic volumes\napproach capacity (the \"hockey stick\" phenomena). Additional locks would be large\nenough to handle larger ships. The so-called Post-Panamax ships include the largest that\nare able to use the Suez Canal (\"Suezmax\") and the largest bulk carriers that are used in\nservice around Africa (\"Capemax\").\n\n4 The operating costs shown in the table represent the costs of operating the facilities at full capacity (i.e.\noperations experiencing an average delay of 10-hours). Assume that half of these operating costs are\nfixed, while the other half would vary with the number of transits.\n\nTable 2: Options for Expanding Capacity of the Canal (as of 1993)\n\nOption\nInvestment\nCost\n($ millions)\nTime to\nImplement\n(Years)\nImpact on\nProductivity and\nCapacity\n\nCapacity\nBase Case\nNo investment;\n$250\nmillion/year for\noperations\nN.A.\n38-39 ships/day\nor about14,000\nper year)\nNavigation\nSystem\n$40 million\nIncrease capacity of\nthe cut by 1 ship/day\n39-40\nPCC\nLocomotives\n$100 million\nReduce cycle time\nfor locks from 50 to\n40 minutes\n41-42 (capacity\nwould still be\nlimited by\noperations in\nthe Cut)\nWiden the Cut\nfor Panamax\nShips\n$2,000 million\n5-10\nEnable 24-hour bi-\ndirectional operation\nof Panamax Ships\n44-45\nFurther widen\nthe Cut for\nPost-Panamax\nShips\n$1,000 million\n3-6\nEnable 24-hour bi-\ndirectional operation\nof Post-Panamax\nShips\n44-45\nThird Set of\nLocks\n$4,300 million\nplus $100\nmillion/year for\noperations once\nopened\n10-20\nAllow Post-Panamax\nships (up to 12,000\nTEU container ships\nand 200,000 DWT\nbulk vessels)and\nmore transits\n60-62\nFourth Set of\nLocks\n$3,500 million\nplus $100\nmillion/year for\noperations\n5-10\nAllow more Post-\nPanamax ships and\nmore transits/day\n75-78\nSea Level\nCanal (Instead\nof 3rd and 4th\nsets of locks)\n$15,000 million\nplus $50\nmillion/year for\noperations\n15-30\nAllow more Post-\nPanamax ships\n80-83\n\na. Create a chart or table showing the cost/transit as a function of volume as this\nseries of capacity enhancements are implemented. Assume that the navigation\nand locomotive projects have a life of 20 years, while the other projects have a\nlife of 50 years. Use constant dollars. Convert the investment costs to an\nequivalent annual cost assuming an 8% discount rate. The cost per transit should\ninclude both operating and capital costs.\n\nb. Create a chart showing the estimated average delay per vessel as a function of\ntransits as the various capacity enhancements are implemented. (Approximate\nnumbers based upon the information given above will be fine - explain your\nreasoning.)\n\nc. Summarize your results and discuss the implications for future expansion of the\nPanama Canal (max 1 page)\n\nQuestion 2: Demand Analysis (3 points)\n\nCustomers will route shipments through the Panama Canal only if this routes minimizes\ntheir Total Logistics Costs (TLC). If the landbridge route or the Suez Canal route or a\nroute around Cape Horn is cheaper, they will use that route. If commodities can be\nobtained more cheaply from another source, then they will avoid supply chains that\ninclude the Panama Canal.\n\nTable 3 provides base case cost and service factors for rail and ocean carriers. The costs\ndo not include the toll for the Panama Canal, and the travel time assumes 12 hours per\ntransit of the Canal.\n\nTable 3: Base Case Assumptions Concerning Cost and Service\nMode\nFixed Cost/ton-\nmile\nVariable Cost\nTravel Time\nRail Intermodal\n$200\n$0.25/container-\nmile\n2 days plus 40 mph\nplus 1 day if trip\ngoes past Chicago\nRail Bulk\n$2/ton\n$0.01/net ton-mile\n2 days plus 20mph\nInland Waterway\n$2/ton\n$0.005/net ton-mile\n4 days plus 4 mph\nPanamax Vessels\n\nOcean Liner Service\n(Containers)\n$50,000 per day\n(6,000 TEU)\n$0.10/container-\nmile\n500 miles per day\nOcean Carrier -\nBulk\n$40,000 per day\n100,000 tons\n$0.002/ton-mile\n400 miles per day\nPost-Panamax\nVessels\n\nOcean Liner Service\n(Containers)\n$60,000 per day\n(9,000 TEU)\n$0.09/container-\nmile\n500 miles per day\nOcean Carrier -\nBulk\n$50,000 per day\n200,000 tons\n$0.0015/ton-mile\n400 miles per day\n\nRapid growth is projected for international trade in general and for container shipping in\nparticular. Containerized freight moving between Asia and the United States is therefore\na critical market for the Panama Canal. Two key factors influence whether this trade\ngoes by rail from West Coast ports or by the Panama Canal direct to East Coast ports:\n\n- The cost, service and capacity of the U.S. ports and the intermodal rail system.\nDelays in the U.S. ports or rail system could add as much as 4-7 days to the land\noptions, and railroads could increase their rates by 50-100% in an attempt to limit\ndemand and maximize their profits\n- The tolls, transit times and types of ships that can be handled by the Panama\nCanal\n\nThere is also an opportunity for freight to move via the Suez Canal if costs and delays\nincreased on the U.S. rail system and the Panama Canal. .\n\na. Create a spreadsheet model for estimating the differences in total logistics costs\nof the main routing and supply chain options available to the following classes\nof shippers:\n- Container (land-bridge vs PCC vs. Suez Canal for moves between Asia and US\n& Canadian EC (value per ton averages $2000 and ranges from less than $500\nto more than $10,000; container loads are assumed to average 13 tons in\ncalculating tolls for the Panama Canal)\n- Grain (grain moving from Iowa or Saskatchewan to Asia via rail to west coast\nports or via Mississippi River to NOLA and via PC to Asia) (value per ton\naverages $200). Assume that the grain would move in the same sized-ship\nwhether it shipped via Panama or via west coast ports.\n- Coal destined to Brazil from Australia, South Africa, Appalachia (Kentucky &\nW. Virginia) or Brazil to Japan (Value per ton at originating port averages $10-\n$30, largely dependent upon the cost of rail transportation from the mine to the\nport). Assume the Pacific Routes use Post Panamax vessels, while the Panama\nCanal can only use the Post-Panamax if the third set of locks or a new canal is\nconstructed.)\n\nThe difference in the TLC will be a function of the tolls and delays at the canal, as\nwell as the differences in distance and transportation rates between the canal route\nand the other routes. Estimate in-transit inventory costs by assuming an annual\nrate of 10% per year.\n\nb. Use your spreadsheet to determine how each traffic class might respond to\nincreases in tolls, increases in delays, or increases in the size of ships that can\nuse the canal. Note: Once you have your model, it will be easy to conduct\nsensitivity analysis or to look at other situations. You may therefore want to look\nat additional movements within one or more of these traffic classes. As you\nreview your results, you may find other interesting issues to explore. The results\nfrom this section should be presented in one or more well-organized tables with\nappropriate titles plus a description of your method.\n\nc. Summarize your results and discuss the implications for future demand for the\nPanama Canal (max 1 page)\n\nQuestion 3: Equilibrium Analysis (4 points)\n\nThe APC has the ability to manage demand by adjusting tolls and by offering multiple\nlevels of service. Raising tolls will tend to divert some traffic to other routes and cause\nshifts in some supply chains (e.g. different sources of bulk products). Capacity could be\nallocated via various mechanisms, including higher tolls for \"1st class service\" or capacity\nauctions. In the absence of any action on the part of the APC, demand will rise to the\npoint that congestion and unreliability cause customers to seek other routes or other\nsources of commodities. Your group has been asked to develop insight into the strategies\nthat APC might pursue and the effects that these strategies might have upon demand and\nrevenue.\n\na. Develop a model for estimating the traffic volume that would move through the\ncanal as a function of the toll charged and the timing of the expansion (using\nthe results of parts 1 & 2 as needed). Table 4 shows the actual tonnage for\nselected commodities for 1990 plus projected traffic through the canal. The\nprojections to 2020 and 2060 were made based upon a simplifying assumption\nthat there were no tolls and no delays at the canal (and no capacity problems on\nthe rail systems). Obviously, if the capacity investments are not made, then the\ntraffic volumes will be much lower. Also, if substantial tolls are charged, then\ntraffic will be diverted from the canal.\n\nTable 4: Annual Cargo Flows through the Panama Canal\n(Actual for 1990; projected for 2020 and 2060 assuming third set of locks that allow\n200,000 DWT ships with no tolls and no delays)\nAnnual Tonnage (Millions)\nCommodity\nAnnaul\nGrowth\n1990-2020\nSelected Commodities\n\n- Containers\n20.8\n50.6\n67.2\n3.0%\n- Coal & Coke\n11.0\n63.8\n82.8\n6.0%\n- Bulk Grains\n23.5\n44.4\n66.9\n1.0%\n\nTotal\n157.5\n363.3\n494.8\n2.8%\nSource: The WEFA Group, Executive Summary, Part 8, \"Commodity and Traffic\nProjection Study\", Final Report of the Commission for the Study of Alternatives to the\nPanama Canal, 1993\n\nb. Based upon your analysis of supply and demand issues, identify 3 strategies that\ncould be pursued. Each strategy should be defined in terms of a toll policy (of\nyour design) and a capacity level (defined as in Table 2).\n\nc. Estimate toll revenues, traffic volume, and traffic mix that will result from each\nstrategy during the period from 2010 to 2060. To simplify the analysis, assume\nthat 30% of the projected traffic (tonnage) for 2020 can be represented by the\nresults for containers, 40% by the results for grain, and 30% by the results for\n\ncoal. The results from this section should be presented in several well-organized\ntables or charts with appropriate titles plus a description of your method.\n\nd. Summarize your results and discuss the implications for expansion of the\nPanama Canal (max 1 page)\n\nNote: the descriptions and numbers used in this assignment are intended to be\nrealistic and representative rather than exact. This assignment will require you to\nexercise considerable judgment concerning what to investigate, what level of detail\nto use, and how best to present your results. The purpose of the various analyses is\nto provide insight into the key issues related to the nature and pace of expansion of\nthe canal. Part B will explore these and other issues from the perspective of\ncustomers, carriers, and other governments, as well as from the perspective of the\nAPC and the GOP. There is no unique \"right\" answer, but there is clearly a role for\nanalysis in helping to understand and evaluate the various options for expanding the\nCanal."

In Assignment 6B, we ask you to\nconsider the policy implications of these various strategies from three different\nperspectives.\n\nThis is an individual assignment. Each member of your group will write a policy memo\nfrom one of three perspectives described below. It is acceptable to begin by\nbrainstorming in a session or two within your group of three about approaches to the\nthree memos. Your group should then self-select such that one member of your group is\nindividually writing one of the policy papers. We will assume that you will be able to\nequitably select topics--if worse comes to worse, you should draw straws if it doesn't\nnaturally come out of your discussion.\n\nThen, each member of the group should individually write the policy memo associated\nwith a particular perspective with no further discussions with your fellow group members.\nCollaboration with members of other groups is not appropriate at any time.\n\nThe policy memo for each of the three perspectives is limited to five pages.\n\nPlease recognize that 6B is worth 4 points (4% of your grade) and that you have only one\nweek to prepare your response--and 6B is doubtless competing with other academic\ndemands on your time. So be realistic and pragmatic in choosing how much time to\nallocate to this effort. Clarity of thought and exposition will be valued more than detailed\nquantitative analysis beyond what you have already performed in 6A.\n\nGood luck!\n\nHere are the three perspectives:\n\n1. The nation of Panama - You are a special assistant to the President of Panama\nand he has asked you to put together a policy memo describing the implications\non Panama of various strategic alternatives for the Panama Canal studied in 6A.\nYou recognize that how Panama chooses to advance will have important\neconomic implications but will likely have some environmental implications as\nwell. Please write the policy memo discussing these issues, as well as other\nperspectives you feel may be important. Recommend to the President what is the\nappropriate way forward for Panama.\n\n2. The Union Pacific Railroad (UP) - The UP is among the largest railroads in the\nUnited States. While it does not itself provide coast-to-coast transportation\nservice, it, together with other railroad and trucking partners, does provide\nservices of that nature. Clearly what Panama decides to do relative to the Panama\nCanal will have implications on the market for freight transportation and for the\nUP.\n\nAs a special assistant to the president of the UP, you are asked to write a memo\nthat discusses the implications of various strategies undertaken by Panama on\nyour market, what strategic alternatives are available for you to consider from the\nrailroad's point of view, and what you recommend UP should do.\n\n3. The World Trade Organization. The WTO is directly concerned with the\ndevelopment of the global economy and also other globally scaled issues,\nincluding climate change. The WTO has publicly espoused the concept of\nsustainability, which requires the balanced consideration of economic\ndevelopment, environmental impact, and social equity.\n\nYou are the special assistant to the chief executive officer of the WTO. She asks\nyou to write a policy memo that discusses the sustainability implications of the\nvarious Panama Canal strategies and recommends what the public posture of the\nWTO should be relative to this major initiative."

Support congestion charging as it would probably give\nthem more funds for public transportation, and increase demand for their services\nc) Memo to Mayor Bloomberg on how to spend toll revenues (7 points):\n1) To collect tolls i.e. invest in the technology and implementation of the congestion\ncharging scheme. If the system is cumbersome, and/or has errors, then the whole scheme\nfails. From London's example over half of toll revenues go in operating costs of\ncollecting tolls\n2) Improve public transportation, all over the city and especially to/from outer boroughs\n3) Improve bike and pedestrian transportation\n4) Encourage transit oriented development, transit accessible affordable housing\n\n5) Improve/increase taxi services\n6) Educate people\n7) Some modest improvement in vehicular transportation to reduce opposition\n\nQuestion 1B (12.5 points)\na) 3 out of 30 key points with justification (2.5 points)\n1) #1, Behavior\n2) #2, Transportation as part of a broader system\n3) #8, Capacity\n4) #9, Supply\n5) #11, Infrastructure shape\n6) #16, Lumpy investment\n7) #17, Capacity, cost and level-of-service\n8) #21, Different time scales\n9) #27, Transportation, economic development, and land-use\n10) #28, Performance measures\nb) 5 stakeholders (3points):\n1) Large corporations.

Worried about impact of congestion on their delivery needs, and so on\ntheir costs\n3) Public transportation, environmental, and smart-growth advocates and planners.

Worried about state of the transportation system including\npublic, private and freight transportation\nc) 3 strategies for relieving congestion in the context of sustainability (7 points):\n1) Only add highway capacity: economic mostly good, environmental mostly bad, equity\nmostly bad\n2) Only improve public transportation: economic both good and bad, environmental good,\nequity mostly good\n3) Improve both highways and public transportation: economic mostly good, environmental\nmostly good, equity mostly good\n4) Congestion charging, with possibly variable rates for freight v. passenger vehicular\ntraffic: economic good, environmental good, equity both good and bad\n5) Variable parking rates for freight v. passenger vehicles: economic mostly good,\nenvironmental good, equity both good and bad\n\n6) Investing in non-truck freight options: economic mostly good, environmental mostly\ngood, equity mostly neutral\n\nQuestion 2 (25 points)\na) Data requirements for mode choice analysis (5 points):\n1) Binary choice: bus and metro\n2) Best path for bus and metro for each origin-destination pair.\n3) Revealed preference survey data between bus and metro\ni) Home interview surveys\nii) On-board surveys\niii) Stated preference surveys could be helpful for supplemental data\n4) Need socio-economic characteristics of the individual e.g. income, gender, education etc.\n5) Need their selected path definition i.e. links making up path, and attributes of selected\nmode e.g. travel time (access, wait and in-vehicle travel times), travel cost, frequency,\ncomfort, reliability, level of service, etc. and transfer/interchange attributes\n6) Need their actual choice\nb) Reasons for model estimation results (5 points):\n1) Two types of explanations:\ni) Modeling assumptions\nii) Actual behavior\n2) Assumes that all individuals are aware about all alternatives (paths and attributes), but\nknowledge about bus paths and attributes is likely to be much lower than for metro paths\nfor some individuals. This alone could explain the results.\n3) Also, finding the best path for buses is likely much harder than for metro, so some\nindividuals may be comparing inferior bus paths to the truly best metro path.\n4) Often stopping and starting (in traffic, at stop lights and to pick up passengers) in buses\nas compared to metro\n5) Real and perceived unreliability in terms of in-vehicle travel time in buses as compared to\nmetro\n6) Real and perceived crowding, exposure to the weather, discomfort, lack of safety etc. in\nbuses as compared to metro\n7) Real or perceived negative connotation of bus versus rail (especially in the US)\nc) Implications for investment (5 points):\n1) The key issue is that the old assumption (note: not the result of estimation) will have\nallocated more passengers to buses and fewer to metro than in fact occurs in reality. Thus\nbuses will have more capacity than required and metro will have less capacity than\nrequired, and so actual crowding on metro will be higher than on buses. This will tend to\nincrease value of additional investment in metro as compared to buses. This means that\nthe capacity constraint on metro (if capacity cannot be increased, or if it is very expensive\nto do so) may in fact be binding (in the real world) when the model suggests it is not.\n2) A second but less key issue is that the old model underestimates the importance of in-\nvehicle travel time for buses. For example the old model estimates that an investment that\nreduces travel time for buses by 10 minutes is considered the same as one that that\nreduces travel time for metro by 10 minutes. However, in reality the 10 minutes reduction\n\nin travel time for buses has a much bigger effect on travel behavior, and so on mode\nchoice than a similar reduction for metro. Consequently, the current model\nunderestimates the importance of investment in bus modes to reduce in-vehicle travel\ntimes. An updated model using the new estimated coefficients for bus versus metro in-\nvehicle travel times will tend to increase value of in-vehicle time reducing investment in\nbuses as compared to metro.\nd) Changes to the structure of the model for a path choice analysis (5 points):\n1) The key issue is that this is no longer a binary mode choice model but a multi-nominal\npath choice model with correlation across some paths\n2) Alternate paths have a number of links and modes, which might overlap\n3) Introduces the complexity of bus-metro transfers for the first time\ne) How to deal with issues of path overlap i.e. violation of iid assumption (5 points):\n1) Alternative paths are not always independent (i.e. there is correlation) as some paths\nmight share same links\n2) Use a nested logit model structure (need some discussion of alternative ways of\nstructuring the nests i.e. tree structure)\n3) Common portions of paths (links and modes) separate from the overlapped portions\n\nQuestion 3 (25 points)\na) Train cycle for options A and B (1 point):\n1) Option A: (1.5+.5+1.5+.5)*2=8 hours\n2) Option B: (2.5+.5)*2=6 hours\nb) Number of trains for 12 trains/day i.e. one every 2 hours, for Option B (1 point):\n1) Option B: 6 hours/2 hours per train=3 trains\nc) Frequency for Option A, with same number of trains as Option B (1 point):\n1) Option A: Headway=8 hours/3 trains=2.67 hours per train, Frequency=24/2.67=9\ntrains/day\nd) Demand between all city pairs (2 points):\nK\n\nOpt A\nOpt B\n\nB-NH\n\nNH-NYC\n\nB-NYC\n\nFare\n\nOpt A\nOpt B\n\nB-NH\n\nNH-NYC\n\nB-NYC\n\nT\n\nOpt A\nOpt B\n\nB-NH\n1.5\n\nNH-NYC\n1.5\n\nB-NYC\n3.5\n2.5\n\nOpt A\nOpt B\nOptions\nFreq\n\nDemand\n\nOpt A\nOpt B\n\nB-NH\n\nNH-NYC\n\nB-NYC\n\nTotal\n\nRevenue\n\nOpt A\nOpt B\n\nB-NH\n\nNH-NYC\n\nB-NYC\n\nTotal\ne) Should the train company stop at New Haven (9 points):\n1) Total demand (potential ridership) is 11571 for Option A v. 4800 for Option B (double if\nconsidering both directions)\n2) Total revenue is $1,414,286 for Option A v. $960,000 for Option B (double if\nconsidering both directions) (make explicit assumption that train company captures all\ndemand i.e. ridership = demand)\n\n3) The train company's evaluation criteria: could be revenue maximizing or ridership\nmaximizing or both (be explicit about this; remember this is a 9 point question)\n4) Yes, would stop at New Haven i.e. Option A, as it has more revenue and more ridership\n5) Option: maybe have some trains stopping at New Haven and some going directly\nf) Explore some changes to Option B, and suggest which are a good idea (7 points):\n1) K and T are fixed. Cannot change\n2) Reduce fares. This will increase demand, but will have no effect on revenues due to the\nmodel structure - demand is inversely proportional (demand=f(1/fare)) to fares, and so\nrevenue (demand*fare) stays the same. So don't reduce fares if revenue maximizing,\nreduce fares if ridership maximizing. Realize that capacity must be sufficient.\n3) Increase frequency, add another train. This will increase demand and revenue - demand is\ndirectly proportional (demand=f(frequency)) to frequency, and so revenue (demand*fare)\nincreases. So increase frequency if revenue maximizing or ridership maximizing. Realize\nthat costs will increase (remember this is a 7 point question)\ng) Some shortcomings in the model (4 points):\n1) Considers the relationship between demand and frequency, and between demand and\nfares as linear, when it should follow the law of diminishing returns\n2) Does not consider seasonal and hourly variations in demand\n3) Does not consider capacity limits\n4) Does not consider other level-of-service variables besides fare and frequency\n5) Does not consider alternatives, competitors, substitutes' level-of-service\n6) Is a deterministic model. Should be probabilistic\n\nQuestion 4 (25 points)\na) Complaints or objections (5 points), and b) Response to complaints or objections (5 points)\n1) Politicians in Panama: They will undoubtedly want a share of the increased revenue from\nthe tolls. This is a matter of negotiation. Key questions are how quickly to build the third\nset of locks, how much (if any) to borrow, and how much to give to GOP now and in the\nfuture. Like the international construction companies, they might want a bigger project\nsooner, especially since they aren't directly paying for it. On the other hand, they might\nwant to defer investment by charging even higher tolls and having more going to GOP\nright away. They may also see this major project as an indication that the Panama Canal\nis more profitable than they realized - so that they might push for related projects, e.g. a\nnew bridge or better development of the waterfront by the Canal.\ni) Want more revenue from tolls. Response:\n(1) Increase contribution to GOP\nii) Want more benefits for Panamanian citizens. Response:\n(1) Show number of jobs will increase\n(2) Promise jobs to citizens\n(3) Reduce foreign workforce\niii) Want bigger project sooner. Response:\n(1) Show that toll revenues will not support it\niv) Want to defer investment, charge higher tolls now, and get greater share of revenue.\nResponse:\n(1) Show that this is unsustainable\n(2) Congestion will increase\n(3) Will lose demand in the long run\nv) Environmental concerns. Response:\n(1) Start environmental impact study\n(2) Propose mitigation measures\n2) Bulk shippers: From Assignment 6A, it is clear that the bulk shippers will be most hurt\nby higher tolls, while they have the most to gain from larger ships. They could argue for\ntolls based upon ability to pay and they might push for a per-ship toll, since they have the\nmost tons/ship. They presumably would push for a faster timetable, as they are unable to\nmake use of the canal right now (because of competitive reasons, as addressed in\nAssignment 6A)\ni) Want lower tolls esp. lower per ton toll. Response:\n(1) Refuse\n(2) Give some discount to larger ships\nii) Want per ship toll. Response:\n(1) Partially accept\niii) Want faster project i.e. increased capacity sooner. Response:\n(1) Show that toll revenues will not support it\n\n3) International construction companies that have the ability to finance and construct multi-\nbillion-dollar infrastructure projects: a case could be made that the Canal Authority is\ngoing too slowly, so that they should be urged to increase the pace of construction in\norder to open up a third set of locks by 2015 or earlier. This would require financing -\nand it would get money to the big construction companies more quickly, In fact, if\nPanama goes slowly enough, they might be able to much more of the work (especially\nroutine dredging) on their own without requiring assistance from multi-national\ncontractors.\ni) Want to increase pace of construction. Response:\n(1) Show that toll revenues will not support it and will require outside financing\n(2) Show that this is best for Panama\n4) Environmental groups in Panama: they are likely to object to taking more land for the\nCanal and to the greater use of water for the lock operations. If the water is to be\nrecycled, they may fear that it will get very contaminated over time, or that Lake Gatun\nwill become salty. They may seek another bridge for better linkage between the two\nhalves of Panama. The technical issues could be addressed through scientific studies, and\nthere is time to develop new approaches to filtering or otherwise cleaning the water.\nPutting in another bridge might be a reasonable idea - and also a way to keep GOP\nhappy.\ni) Object to water contamination, land deforestation, loss of habitat and wildlife.\nResponse:\n(1) Start environmental impact study\n(2) Propose mitigation measures\nc) Effect of Nicaragua's canal on the Panama Canal (5 points):\n1) Tolls have doubled to $6 per ton, which has limited growth of demand. The 200 million\ntons carried in 2006 is lower than would be expected given the demand projections in 6A\n(up from 157 in 1993 to 363 million tons by 2020), suggesting that the APC is driving\ntraffic away with its aggressive toll (just as planned). 200 million tons at $6 per ton is\n$1.2 billion per year. Nicaragua's $20 billion project will have interest costs of $1.2\nbillion per year (equivalent to the total revenue from the Panama Canal) when it opens -\nassuming no overruns. Can they possible expect to cover their costs? Implications:\ni) If new canal is built, it will add a lot more capacity - so will APC need to add\ncapacity? May not need to expand the Panama Canal\nii) Competition could lead to a rate war - but APC should win, since they don't have\ndebt.\niii) Traffic might divert to the new route because it provides a quicker route between Asia\nand the Atlantic (a sea level route would allow for a quicker transit, and the route via\nNicaragua would be a little shorter). Might take away high value large ship traffic.\nBut overall demand might be enough for both canals.\niv) Development of container terminals and other trade-related activity could be diverted\nto Nicaragua.\nv) The environmental disruption of the third locks project could be shifted to another\ncountry. Will reduce the environmental degradation due to Panama Canal expansion\n\nd) Possible responses to the Nicaragua Canal proposal, and e) advantages/disadvantages of\neach and justification of one (5 points):\n1) Do nothing against the Nicaragua Canal, on the assumption that the new canal will never\nbe built, and proceed with plan for Panama Canal Expansion. Nicaragua's $20 billion\nproject will have interest costs of $1.2 billion per year (equivalent to the total revenue\nfrom the Panama Canal) when it opens - assuming no overruns.\ni) Advantage:\n(1) Costs nothing\n(2) Failed project will increase value of Panama Canal\nii) Disadvantage:\n(1) The Nicaragua Canal project might get built under different financing structure\n2) Expose the weakness of the case for the new canal via thorough studies involving\nindependent agencies, shippers, etc. Question the technical and the economic feasibility.\nQuestion what profits, if any, will go to Nicaragua and what will go to the construction\ncompanies and the banks.\ni) Advantage:\n(1) The Nicaragua Canal project will be exposed as infeasible\nii) Disadvantage:\n(1) The Nicaragua Canal project might come out better, if changed to meet criticisms\n3) Accelerate the Panama Canal schedule for a third set of locks - since Panama's capacity\nonly costs about $5 billion and presumably could be completed before Nicaragua's much\nlarger project. However, if there is another canal, Panama doesn't have to worry about its\ncapacity - and they can always undercut the new canal since they don't have any debt.\ni) Advantage:\n(1) Will give Panama Canal a head start, and a monopoly till the Nicaragua Canal is\nbuilt\nii) Disadvantage:\n(1) Toll revenues cannot support it, will have to borrow money\n4) Do nothing or defer the investment in the third set of locks, on the assumption that no\ncapacity will be needed.\ni) Advantage:\n(1) Costs nothing\n(2) Keeps Panama Canal monopoly in the meantime\n(3) No environmental costs for Panama\nii) Disadvantage:\n(1) May be wrong about demand v. capacity and so might lose out to Nicaragua\nCanal in the long run\n(2) May lose out to Nicaragua Canal in the high value, large ship market\n5) Sell the Panama Canal to those who are backing the new canal - at a price less than that\nof the new canal; or pursue aggressive toll-based financing for the Panama Canal (a\nleveraged buyout, if you will)\n\ni) Advantage:\n(1) Makes money\nii) Disadvantage:\n(1) Lose ongoing revenue source\n(2) Selling national asset will stir political opposition\n6) Join the consortium for constructing the sea-level canal or partner with the Nicaragua\nCanal\ni) Advantage:\n(1) Maintain monopoly in the long run\n(2) Control international shipping as before\nii) Disadvantage:\n(1) Costs money\n(2) Could be seen as anti-competitive by the international community\n(3) Take on risks of Nicaragua Canal project\n(4) They might not want to do so\n7) Call upon the World Bank to conduct an impartial assessment of the need for capacity\nand of the best options for achieving that capacity.\ni) Advantage:\n(1) Nicaragua Canal project might be stopped\nii) Disadvantage:\n(1) Panama Canal expansion might be stopped too\n8) Decrease Panama Canal tolls\ni) Advantage:\n(1) Will make Panama Canal more competitive v. the Nicaragua Canal\nii) Disadvantage:\n(1) Will reduce toll revenues\n(2) Will jeopardize Panama Canal expansion plan\n(3) Will increase congestion till Nicaragua Canal opens"

Please write such a memo. (7.0)\n______________________________________________________________________\n\nAbstracted from \"Bigger Push for Charging Drivers Who Use the Busiest Streets,\" The New\nYork Times, November 24, 2006. by William Neuman\n\nCongestion pricing, the idea of charging drivers for bringing vehicles into the busiest parts of\nManhattan, has become a key strategy for transportation advocates and urban planners in New\nYork.\n\nA diverse array of civic and community groups - including such unlikely allies as conservative\nscholars and take-back-the-streets cycling advocates - are cautiously moving to raise the subject\nof congestion pricing in the hope of overcoming the resistance of New Yorkers and their political\nleaders. They are also hoping to influence a long-term strategic plan the city is preparing, which\nthey expect will address traffic congestion.\n\n\"There are a number of groups, who come at this from very different perspectives, who don't\ngenerally agree on a lot, who want to see this happen,\" said Jeremy Soffin, vice president for\npublic affairs of the Regional Plan Association, which studies transportation and development\nissues. \"There's been a concerted effort to work together.\"\n\nNow, an influential business group called the \"Partnership for New York\" expects to release a\nrevamped study in early December that will analyze the cost of clogged streets, estimated at $12\nbillion to $15 billion a year. A related study done with Environmental Defense, a national\nenvironmental group, will look at the environmental costs of excess traffic and at the potential\nfor congestion pricing to reduce traffic and thereby cut air pollution and, as a result, illnesses like\nasthma.\n\nMs. Wylde, president of the Partnership for New York, plans to discuss the economic study at a\nforum on Dec. 7 sponsored by the Manhattan Institute, a conservative research organization that\nis set to release a report of its own \"on the feasibility of road pricing in New York.\" The report is\nto include the results of focus groups meant to gauge the attitudes of New Yorkers toward such a\nprogram.\n\nSome grass-roots groups have already begun to take up the issue.\n\nOn Nov. 14, about 50 people from a coalition of 125 civic and community groups gathered on\nthe steps of City Hall to ask that New York Mayor Bloomberg consider a series of measures to\nreduce traffic.\n\nThe coalition is led by Transportation Alternatives, an organization that promotes mass transit\nand works to make streets more welcoming to pedestrians and cyclists. It includes neighborhood\ngroups like Sustainable South Bronx and biking advocates like the FreeWheels Bicycle Defense\nFund.\n\nThe coalition wants more speed bumps on neighborhood streets and a crackdown on illegal\nparking, but it also asks that the city study congestion pricing.\n\n''Among all the measures we're discussing, it has the most potential for reducing traffic,'' said\nPaul Steely White, the director of Transportation Alternatives.\n\nHe acknowledged that it would be a big change for drivers to pay to use streets that they are\naccustomed to using free and that there was a lot of political ground to cover first.\n\nMr. White said any congestion pricing program would have to be combined with -- or preferably\npreceded by -- other measures like improving bus service and smoothing traffic flow. His group\nhas asked the city to move beyond what has already been done to reduce the number of parking\npermits given to city employees, who drive to work in large numbers. Transportation\nAlternatives would also like to see more Midtown parking spaces converted to loading zones so\nthat streets are not clogged with double-parked trucks unloading goods.\n\nAdvocates of congestion pricing are reluctant to make specific proposals on how it could be\ncarried out in New York, but they often point to London as an example of a successful program.\n\nChampioned by an activist mayor, London's program began in early 2003 and has significantly\nreduced traffic and sped up bus lines. London drivers must pay as much as $19 a day to enter the\nroad pricing zone in the city center. They can pay in a variety of ways, including online, by\nphone, by mail or at designated shops or gas stations. Cameras around the congestion zone read\nvehicle license plates and feed the numbers to a computer that checks to see who paid their fees.\nThose who have not paid can be fined.\n\nOne of the most outspoken opponents of congestion pricing in New York has been David I.\nWeprin, a City Council member who represents some neighborhoods in eastern Queens that are\nfar from subway lines and where residents with jobs in Manhattan are more likely to drive to\nwork.\n\nHe said congestion pricing amounted to an unfair tax on residents in those areas, many of whom\ncan ill afford it.\n\n''The potential for causing hardship to people who rely on their cars in boroughs other than\nManhattan is too great to try to implement congestion pricing at this point,'' Mr. Weprin said.\n\nIn response, advocates said revenue from a congestion pricing program should be reserved for\npublic transportation improvements that would help the outer boroughs. For instance, if new or\nfaster bus routes could bring residents into Manhattan or to subway stations more efficiently,\nthey may be more willing to not drive. That would also help answer critics who have said\ncongestion pricing is nothing more than a new tax that would go straight into the city's general\nbudget.\n\nMost of all, the advocates of congestion pricing have their eyes on the long-term strategic plan\nfor the city being prepared by Deputy Mayor Daniel L. Doctoroff. The plan is a response to\npredictions that the city will add one million residents by 2025, and figuring out how to keep\npeople and vehicles moving around an ever more crowded city will be an important part of it.\nThe activists hope that it will include a recommendation for some form of congestion pricing.\n\nMr. Doctoroff refused to talk about what the plan would include, but he said he was aware that\ntraffic is a concern.\n\n''It's clear the level of congestion is an inhibitor to growth,'' Mr. Doctoroff said. ''We believe that\nsmart growth is good, and therefore we need to provide additional capacity on every mode of\ntransportation.'' That, he said, includes city streets, and he added, ''How we do that, that's what\nwe're thinking through now.''\n\n1B - Impact of Congestion on Urban Freight (12.5 points)\n\nConsider this article in a well-respected transportation newsletter called \"Surface Transportation\nand Innovations\" by Bob Poole. The article is headlined \"Portland Confronts Good-Movement\nCongestion\" and has been slightly edited by the 1.201 teaching staff. This article deals with the\nimpact of congestion on freight transportation in Portland, Oregon\n\nAnd then answer the following questions:\n\n1. Identify three of the 30 key points you think are most important for this complex\ntransportation situation, and justify your choices in a few sentences. (2.5)\n\n2. List five groups of stakeholders and participants related to this complex transportation\nsituation and indicate how they are affected, in one or two sentences each. (3.0)\n\n3. As the article suggests, Portland has been a leader in transit, subsidized development\naround transit stations, and in introducing an urban growth boundary (which makes it\ndifficult to build far from the urban core). In particular Portland advocates transit use,\nrather than automobile use, by travelers.\n\nThe question is what these policies have produced in the context of \"sustainability\" as we\nhave discussed it in class. This is characterized by the 3 Es; Economic Development as\nenabled by mobility, Environmental Impact, and Social Equity. Identify three strategies for\nrelieving congestion in Portland, including one NOT discussed in the article, and discuss how\neach of them performs on the three dimensions of sustainability in a few sentences each.\n(7.0)\n_______________________________________________________________________\n\nAbstracted from \"Portland Confronts Freight-Movement Congestion\" by Bob Poole\n\nFor much of the past two decades, Portland has been a leader in the transit and smart-growth\napproach to dealing with traffic congestion. The area has spent heavily on light-rail transit,\nsubsidized development around transit stations, and imposed an urban growth boundary, among\nother things. Critics pointed out that its traffic congestion kept increasing, but some smart-\ngrowthers even viewed that positively, on the grounds that terrible congestion would push more\npeople out of cars and onto transit.\n\nBut in trying to implement this vision, freight-movement was ignored. And eventually Portland's\nbusiness community started to notice that congestion was having serious impacts on them.\nPortland Gas & Electric finds that in just the last seven years, congestion has added 20 to 30\nminutes to the travel times of its crews, which costs them $30-50 per day for each of the 36\ncrews. Intel has had to shift the time for outgoing overnight shipments back two hours, to be\n\nsure they get to the airport on time. SYSCO Food Services had to open a new distribution center\nin Spokane, WA because trips through Portland were taking so long. Even pizza operators have\nhad to cut their radius of delivery.\n\nThe points come from a detailed study sponsored by the Portland business community, with the\ncooperation of Portland Metro and Oregon DOT. \"The Cost of Congestion to the Economy of the\nPortland Region\" is the first case study I've seen that focuses primarily on the costs of\ncongestion to businesses and a metro area's economy. It was carried out by Economic\nDevelopment Research Group (EDRG), a Boston firm headed by economist Glen Weisbrod\n(who studied transportation at MIT), whose pioneering NCHRP study on the costs of congestion\nto regional economies I reported on in Issue No. 22.\n\nPortland is particularly hard-hit by traffic congestion because \"a significant part of [its] economy\nis based on the city's location as a gateway port for marine and air movement, and intersection of\nmajor cross-continent highway and rail routes.\" Because these functions all depend heavily on\ntrucks, \"they are particularly vulnerable to worsening highway congestion.\" The study also notes\nthat \"The effects of congestion are eroding the significant progress that has been made in\ninventory management and control, by re-introducing uncertainty in shipping and receiving\nattributable to the over-the-road and 'last mile' portion of the supply chain system.\"\n\nThe EDRG study used Portland's transportation planning model to project congestion into the\nfuture, assuming the existing long-range transportation plan in implemented, as written. It\npredicts much worse congestion by 2025. Then it modeled Portland's unfunded alternative plan,\nwhich increases both transit and highway capital spending by $6.2 billion. The result is that\ncongestion would still be worse than today, but that extra money would save 30 million vehicle-\nhours per year that would otherwise be wasted in congestion.\n\nHad the modeling focused more on adding highway capacity, the savings might have been far\ngreater. An earlier study by Hartgen & Fields estimated that spending $2.7 billion more in\nPortland, solely to add highway capacity, would yield annual savings of 101 million hours per\nyear by 2030, eliminating all Level of Service F conditions (the worst level of congestion). As\nthe Portland business community ponders what to do next, they should take a closer look at\nwhich investments produce how much congestion reduction.\n\nQuestion 2 (25 points)\n\nThis question deals with demand\n(Each question is worth 5 points)\n\nConsider a major metropolitan area which has extensive metro and bus networks, such as New\nYork City, London, Tokyo or Mexico City. The focus of this question is the analysis of travel\ndemand by transit in this city and specifically the choice of path (or route) to get from one point\nto another within the city. For the purposes of this question you may assume that there is a fixed\ndemand matrix (i.e. that demand between origin-destination pairs is not a function of the level-\nof-service, and so can be assumed to be constant) representing travel by transit between all\norigin-destination pairs and that the only modes of interest are metro and bus.\n\na) What data would you need to estimate a discrete choice binary logit model reflecting\nindividual's choices between metro and bus in this city? You may assume that the\nattributes which affect choice are the in-vehicle time, walk access time, wait time and\ncost for the best paths between an origin-destination pair by bus and metro.\n\nUp to the current time it has been assumed that the coefficients for in-vehicle time for metro and\nbus are the same - in other words passengers evaluate ten minutes of in-vehicle time on metro as\nbeing equivalent to ten minutes of in-vehicle time on bus. This assumption has been imbedded\ninto the urban transport model system used in this area to plan and evaluate changes in the metro\nand bus system. However the result of the estimation of the utility function in the discrete choice\nmodel obtained from a study similar to that outlined in a) above, now show that passengers\nactually value in-vehicle time in bus as being 50% more frustrating than in-vehicle time in metro,\ni.e. the coefficient for in-vehicle time for bus is 1.5 times the coefficient for in-vehicle time for\nmetro. Given this new information answer the following questions:\n\nb) List and explain the possible reasons why the model estimation results show that in-\nvehicle time for bus is less attractive than the in-vehicle time for metro.\n\nc) Discuss the implications of changing the coefficients of the in-vehicle time consistent\nwith the newly estimated values on alternative investments on bus and metro\nimprovements. You may assume that the urban transport model system had previously\nbeen fit to the available travel demand data but with the assumption, now proven wrong,\nthat in-vehicle times were viewed as equivalent between metro and bus. Think through\nthe implications of the model changes versus what would actually happen in the real\nworld should proposed changes be implemented. Remember that the model system is\nfitted to actual data to describe current travel behavior and then applied with different\nattributes describing the proposed changes in the bus and/or metro systems.\n\nFinally let us look at a more realistic scenario in which travelers are considering paths which\ncombine metro and bus as well as several paths on both metro and bus.\n\nd) What are the most important changes you would need to make in the structure of your\nmodel to deal with this more realistic but clearly more complex path choice problem?\n\ne) How could you deal with the issues of path overlap which will clearly arise in this\nversion of the problem?\n\nQuestion 3 (25 points)\n\nThis question deals with a simplified high-speed rail service in the Northeast Corridor.\n\nIn Option A, the service has three stops, in Boston, New Haven and New York City.\n\nOPTION A\n\n.5\nBoston\n\n1.5\n\n.5\nNew Haven\n\n1.5\n\n.5\nNew York City\n\nThe link travel times are 1.5 hours between each pair of cities in both directions. The time it\ntakes to service the train at each node is 0.5 hours.\n\nPeople in Boston and New York City are interested in better service between these two major\ncities and suggest not stopping in New Haven. This is Option B.\n\nOPTION B\n\n.5\nBoston\n\n2.5\n\n.5\nNew York City\n\nThe travel time between Boston and New York City in both directions is now 2.5 hours. The\ntime it takes to service the train in Boston and New York City is still 0.5 hours.\n\n1. (1 point)\n\nCalculate the train-cycle for Option A and Option B.\n\n2. (1 point)\n\nHow many trains do you need to operate 12 trains/day uniformly distributed throughout the\nday for Option B?\n\n3. (1 point)\n\nWith that number of trains, what frequency can you provide for Option A, with the trains\nuniformly distributed through the day?\n\nIf the numbers come out non-integer, go back and check your work!\n\nHere is some additional information.\n\nThe following is a matrix of K coefficients used for estimating demand between each pair of\ncities.\n\nK MATRIX\n\nBoston\nNew Haven\nNew York City\nX\nX\n\nBoston\nNew Haven\nNew York City\nX\n\nHere is the FARE Matrix -- FARES IN $.\n\nFARE MATRIX\n\nBoston\nNew Haven\nNew York City\nX\nX\n\nBoston\nNew Haven\nNew York City\nX\n\nThe demand between any pair of cities is\n\nK - FREQ\n\nFREQ in trains/day\nD =\n\n* 1000\nT in hours\n\nT - FARE\n\nFARE in $\n\nWhere\nT is the travel time between those cities;\nK is taken from the K Matrix for that city pair;\nFARE is taken from the FARE Matrix for those two cities.\n\nTo make the calculations simpler, the system is perfectly symmetrical with respect to direction of\ntravel.\n\n4. (2 points)\n\nCalculate the demand between all pairs of cities for both Options A and B.\n\nNOW, you are ready to answer the real question!\n\n5. (9 points)\n\nYOU ARE THE TRAIN COMPANY. SHOULD YOU STOP AT NEW HAVEN?\n\nDo whatever further calculations you need to and indicate whether or not you would stop at\nNew Haven and explain why.\n\n6. (7 points)\n\nNOW, considering only Option B, and considering the travel time and train service times and\nthe K matrix as fixed, explore some changes to this service and suggest which changes are a\ngood idea.\n\n7. (4 points)\n\nSuggest some shortcomings in the model used in this analysis.\n\nQuestion 4 (25 points)\n\nThis question deals with the Panama Canal\n\nPart 1 Background\n\nIt is 1993. The Panama Canal handles about 165 million tons per year, tolls are $3/ton, and\nannual revenues are nearly $500 million. A demand study estimated that much more tonnage\nwould flow through the Canal in the future, so long as sufficient capacity was available. This\nstudy ignored the effects of tolls and delays. It concluded that demand could increase to 363\nmillion tons/year by 2020 and increase to nearly 500 million tons/year by 2060. The Panama\nCanal Authority has decided upon the following plan for expanding the capacity of the canal:\n1. Acquire additional locomotives and install a navigation system by 1995 (at a total cost of\n$140 million)\n2. Start work on widening the cut so that it can allow bi-directional operation of Panamax\nships by 2008 (at a cost of $2 billion)\n3. Double the tolls when Panama gains control of the canal in 2000 in order to:\na. Increase the funds available for investing in capacity improvements\nb. Encourage the use of Panamax vessels\nc. Provide a means of avoiding congestion at the canal\n4. Complete the third set of locks by 2020 at a cost of $4.3 billion\n5. Widen the cut for bi-directional operation of Post-Panamax ships by 2025 at a cost of $1\nbillion\n\nThe Panama Canal Authority anticipates that this plan will:\n1. Provide sufficient capacity to meet demand through 2060.\n2. Allow construction to be funded from toll revenues, without requiring the authority to\nborrow money or to sell bonds to finance the expansion.\n3. Allow a fairly constant rate of investment in infrastructure from 1994 to 2025.\n\nThe plan immediately received widespread applause from most of the world's shipping\ncommunity, because it would allow cheaper ocean transport and eliminate the possibility that the\nPanama Canal could become a bottleneck that restricts international trade. However, potential\nopposition to the proposal is expected from several sources:\n1. Politicians in Panama\n2. Bulk shippers\n3. International construction companies that have the ability to finance and construct multi-\nbillion-dollar infrastructure projects\n4. Environmental groups in Panama\n\nPart 1 Questions (5 points each for a & b below): For each of these groups:\na. What complaints or objections do you anticipate?\nb. As the executive director of the Panama Canal Authority, how would you respond\nto this opposition? You may consider defending your plan, modifying your plan,\nor giving some sort of payment to those who would be hurt by the plan.\n\nPart 2 Background\n\nIt is now 2006. The Panama Canal Authority has followed the strategy outlined above for 13\nyears. The toll policy has led to the diversion of some freight, but annual tonnage has grown to\n200 million tons per year. There has also been an increase in the average size of ships moving\nthrough the canal. As planned in 1993, tolls were sharply increased in 2000 and revenues are\nnow about $1.2 billion per year. The higher tolls have helped the canal avoid congestion.\n\nHowever, Nicaragua has just announced plans to construct a sea-level canal through their\ncountry. This project is expected to cost $20 billion, and it is expected to be completed by 2015.\nThe project will provide a slightly shorter route between Asia and the Atlantic, and it will allow\nsimultaneous bi-directional operation of Post-Panamax ships. The project will be financed by\nselling bonds and by loans from the Nicaraguan government; the average interest rate is expected\nto be about 6% per year.\n\nPart 2 Questions (5 points each for c, d & e below)\nYour role is to identify and assess ways that the Panama Canal Authority might respond to this\ncompetitive threat (5 points each):\n\nc. How would a new Canal in nearby Nicaragua affect the Panama Canal?\nd. Identify three ways that the Panama Canal Authority could react to the proposal to\nbuild a new canal.\ne. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each alternative, and recommend\nand justify one of them as the best strategy for the Panama Canal Authority."

Sussman\nMIT\n1.201J/11.545J, ESD.210J Introduction to Transportation Systems\nFall 2006\nLECTURES 2, 3, & 4\nDISPLAYS\nSeptember 12, 14, & 19, 2006\nPart III\n\nThe Elevator Example\nElevators are simple compared to some of the\nmore complex transportation systems, but they\ncan be instructive and illustrative.\nWith this simple example we can gain insight into\noverall system behavior that we can apply to\nmore complex systems.\n\nElevator System\nFigure 6.1\nDiagram o\nf\ne\nl\ne\nvators in a building.\nFigure by MIT OCW.\n\nKey Point 6: Transfers\nIntermodal and intramodal transfers are key\ndeterminants of service quality and cost.\nTransfers between elements of the transportation\nsystem are often inefficient. In the elevator\nexample, a transfer from the walk-mode as one\ncomes into the building, to the elevator-mode,\nimplies some waiting and, hence, some\ninefficiency.\n\nKey Point 8: Capacity\n\"Capacity\" is a complex, multi-dimensional\nsystem characteristic affected by:\ninfrastructure\nvehicles\ntechnology\nlabor\ninstitutional factors\noperating policy\nexternal factors (e.g., \"clean air\", safety,\nregulation)\n\nKey Point 8: Capacity (continued)\nIn the elevator example,\nWe could increase the number of\nelevators.\nWe can also change vehicle\ntechnology. For example, we could\nhave larger or faster elevators.\nWe could have capacity\nimprovements as a result of control\ntechnologies and smarter algorithms\nfor dispatching.\n\nKey Point 9: Supply\nLevel-of-service = f (volume); Transportation Supply. As\nvolume approaches capacity, level-of-service deteriorates\ndramatically -- the \"hockey stick\" phenomenon.\nLOS vs. Volume: The Hockey Stick\nFigure 6.3\nGra\nph sho\nwing how\nlevel o\nf service decreases near capacity.\nFigure by MIT OCW.\n\nDirect Elevator Service\nFigure 7.1\nDi\nre\nct\n\ne\nlevator service between all sixty floors.\nFigure by MIT OCW.\n\nAnother Elevator Configuration\nFigure 7.2\nEl\ne\nv\na\nt\no\nr\ns\ner\nvi\nce\nbetween each tenth floor.\nFigure by MIT OCW.\n\nWhat configuration of elevators makes the most\nsense?\nWhat is the basic trade-off here from the\nviewpoint of the building owner?\n\nKey Point 11: Infrastructure \"Shape\"\nThe \"shape\" of transportation infrastructure\nimpacts the fabric of \"geo-economic\" structures.\n\nKey Point 14: Cost/Level-of-Service\nTrade-offs\nCost/level-of-service trade-offs are a\nfundamental tension for the transportation\nprovider and for the transportation\ncustomer, as well as between them.\n\nKey Point 15: Demand Consolidation\nConsolidation of like-demands is\noften used as a cost-minimizing\nstrategy.\nFor example, when an airline runs a\nhub-and-spoke operation, it is\nconsolidating people from different\norigins who have common\ndestinations into airplanes to lower\ncosts.\n\nKey Point 16: \"Lumpy\" Investment\nInvestments in capacity are often lumpy (e.g.,\ninfrastructure).\nCapacity of\nSingle vs. Double Track\nRail Line\nFigure 7.7\nDiagrams of\nsingle and double track rail li\nnes.\nFigure by MIT OCW.\n\nKey Point 17: Capacity, Cost and\nLevel-of-Service\nThe linkages between capacity, cost and level-of-service\n-- the lumpiness of investment juxtaposed with the\n\"hockey stick\" level-of-service function as volume\napproaches capacity -- is the central challenge of\ntransportation systems design.\nIf we underinvest in capacity, our level-of-service may be\nuncompetitive. If we overinvest, level-of-service may be\nfine, but costs will be high and our prices may not be\ncompetitive. Making this decision, faced with lumpy\ninvestments and the \"hockey stick\" LOS/volume relation,\nis difficult indeed. This leads to the central challenge of\ntransportation system design.\n\nOur Next Concept -- Peaking\nVolume vs. Time of Day\nFigure 8.1\nGraphs\nof ridership vo\nlume against ti\nme of day.\nFigure by MIT OCW.\n\nHow much capacity should we provide?\nDifferent Capacity Decisions\nSo what do we do? We cannot choose such a low capacity that\ncustomer levels-of-service during peak periods are unacceptable.\nAt the same time, however, we cannot provide a level-of-service\nsuch that nobody ever has to wait\n-- it's not economical. So, capacity3 may be a good\ncompromise. The question of design capacity and how we\naccommodate temporal peaks in demand is Key Point 18.\nFigure 8.2\nGraph showi\nng severa\nl possibl\ne capacities of\nservice.\nFigure by MIT OCW.\n\nKey Point 18: Peaking\nTemporal peaking in demand:\na fundamental issue is design capacity -- how\noften do we not satisfy demand?\n\nOur Next Concept\nThe volume that a transportation service attracts\nis a function of the level-of-service provided to\ncustomers. If the level-of-service deteriorates,\nless people will want to use the service.\nThis is simply a micro-economic concept. For\nexample, if a movie theater doubles its price,\ntherefore making its service less attractive -- in\nthis case, more expensive -- fewer people will go\nto that movie theater. If a movie theater halves\nits price, more people will go.\n\nKey Point 19: Volume = ƒ(level-of-\nservice); Transportation Demand\nTransportation Demand: LOS vs. Volume\nFigure 8.3\nAs lev\nel\nof service increases, volume increases up to a plateau.\nFigure by MIT OCW.\n\nKey Point 21: Different Time Scales\nDifferent transportation system\ncomponents and relevant external\nsystems operate and change at different\ntime scales, e.g.,\nShort run -- operating policy\nMedium run -- auto ownership\nLong run -- infrastructure, land use.\n\nEquilibrium between Supply and\nDemand\nLevel-of-service is a function of volume. As\na facility gets congested, the level-of-service\nfor customers deteriorates, as discussed in\nKey Point 9.\nBut, as level-of-service changes, demand\nchanges as well. Demand increases as\nlevel-of-service improves and decreases as\nlevel-of-service deteriorates.\n\nKey Point 22: Equilibrium\nEquilibration of transportation supply and\ndemand for transportation service to predict\nvolume is a fundamental network analysis\nmethodology.\nFigure 8.4\nVolume\nand level of se\nrv\nice\nat equ\nilibrium.\nFigure by MIT OCW.\n\nKey Point 26: Stochasticity\nStochasticity -- in supply and demand -- is\ncharacteristic of transportation systems.\n\nStochasticity\nStochasticity in traffic volume is different than peaking.\nFigure 9.1\nGrap\nh show\ning variation o\nf pea\nk volume.\nFigure by MIT OCW.\n\nMeasuring Transportation System\nPerformance\nWhat do your customers perceive?\nOur ways of measuring performance have to\nrelate to the ways in which our customers make\ndecisions about whether to use us or our\ncompetitors.\n\nPerformance Measures and Cost\n\nA second concept is that performance measures have to relate\nto costs of operations and revenues derived from operations of\nthose systems.\n\nThe customer cares about system performance (e.g., overall\ntravel time), but\n\nA third concept: System vs. Component Performance. The\noperation is often managed on a component basis.\n\nThe hope is, if we do a good job of operating the components,\nthe system as a whole will operate well. Usually, it is a\nnecessary condition that component operation be effective for\nsystem operation to be effective, but it is very often not a\nsufficient condition. We can have a poorly meshed system in\nwhich the components are operating well, but the system\nperformance is still poor.\n\nKey Point 28: Performance Measures\nPerformance measures shape transportation\noperations and investment.\nCLASS DISCUSSION\nSome examples from transportation systems you\nare familiar with.\n\nKey Points -- Summary (1)\n1.\nPeople and organizations alter behavior based on transportation\nservice expectations.\n2.\nTransportation service is part of a broader system -- economic, social\nand political in nature.\n3.\nCompetition (or its absence) for customers by operators is a critical\ndeterminant of the availability of quality transportation service.\n4.\nAnalyzing the flow of vehicles on transportation networks, and defining\nand measuring their cycle, is a basic element of transportation systems\nanalysis.\n5.\nQueuing for service and for customers and storage for\nvehicles/freight/travelers, etc., are fundamental elements of\ntransportation systems.\n\nKey Points -- Summary (2)\n6.\nIntermodal and intramodal transfers are key determinants of service\nquality and cost.\n7.\nOperating policy affects level-of-service.\n8.\n\"Capacity\" is a complex, multi-dimensional system characteristic\naffected by:\ninfrastructure\nvehicles\ntechnology\nlabor\ninstitutional factors\noperating policy\nexternal factors (e.g., \"clean air\", safety, regulation)\n9.\nLevel-of-service = ƒ(volume); Transportation Supply. As volume\napproaches capacity, level-of-service deteriorates dramatically -- the\n\"hockey stick\" phenomenon.\n10. The availability of information (or the lack) drives system operations and\ninvestment and customer choices.\n\nKey Points -- Summary (3)\n11. The \"shape\" of transportation infrastructure impacts the fabric of\n\"geo-economic\" structures.\n12. The cost of providing a specific service, the price charged for that\nservice, and the level-of-service provided may not be consistent.\n13. The computation of cost for providing specific services is complex\nand often ambiguous.\n14. Cost/level-of-service trade-offs are a fundamental tension for the\ntransportation provider and for the transportation customer, as\nwell as between them.\n15. Consolidation of like-demands is often used as a cost-minimizing\nstrategy.\n\nKey Points -- Summary (4)\n16.\nInvestments in capacity are often lumpy (e.g., infrastructure).\n17.\nThe linkages between capacity, cost and level-of-service -- the\nlumpiness of investment juxtaposed with the \"hockey stick\" level-of-\nservice function as volume approaches capacity -- is the central\nchallenge of transportation systems design.\n18.\nTemporal peaking in demand: a fundamental issue is design capacity --\nhow often do we not satisfy demand?\n19.\nVolume = ƒ (level-of-service); Transportation Demand.\n20.\nLevel-of-service is usually multi-dimensional. For analysis purposes, we\noften need to reduce it to a single dimension, which we call utility.\n\nKey Points -- Summary (5)\n21.\nDifferent transportation system components and relevant external systems\noperate and change at different time scales, e.g.,\nShort run -- operating policy\nMedium run -- auto ownership\nLong run -- infrastructure, land use\n22.\nEquilibration of transportation supply and demand for transportation service to\npredict volume is a fundamental network analysis methodology.\n23.\nPricing of transportation services to entice different behavior is a mechanism for\nlowering the negative externalities caused by transportation users on other users\nand society-at-large.\n24.\nGeographical and temporal imbalances of flow are characteristic in transportation\nsystems.\n25.\nNetwork behavior and network capacity, derived from link and node capacities\nand readjustment of flows on redundant paths, are important elements in\ntransportation systems analysis.\n\nKey Points -- Summary (6)\n26. Stochasticity -- in supply and demand -- is characteristic of\ntransportation systems.\n27. The relationship among transportation, economic development, and\nlocation of activities -- the transportation/land-use connection -- is\nfundamental.\n28. Performance measures shape transportation operations and investment.\n29. Balancing centralized control with decisions made by managers of\nsystem components (e.g., terminals) is an important operating\nchallenge.\n30. The integrality of vehicle/infrastructure/ control systems investment,\ndesign and operating decisions is basic to transportation systems\ndesign."

Martland\n\nDuality of Costs & Productivity\n- Cost Function\n- Minimize cost of resources required to\nproduce desired services\n- Production Function\n- Maximize value of output obtained from\ngiven resources\n\nBasic Economic Concepts- Differing\nPerspectives of Economists and Engineers\nProduction functions\nEconomists either assume this is known or try to estimate a very\naggregate model based upon actual performance\nEngineers are constantly trying to \"improve productivity\", i.e. find\nbetter ways to use resources to produce more or better goods and\nservices\nCost functions\nBoth use total, average, variable, and marginal costs; engineers\ngo into much greater detail than economists\nShort-run and long-run cost functions\nEconomists typically focus on effects of volume and prices\nEngineers typically focus on costs and capacity\nDuality of production and cost functions\n\nUsing Average and Marginal Costs\nProfitability/Subsidy Requirements\nComparison of average costs and average revenue\nAverage revenue per trip is a natural way to look at\nrevenue, so this becomes a useful way to look at\ncosts\nProfitablity of a particular trip\nComparison of marginal cost and marginal revenue\nEconomic efficiency (or business common sense)\nPrice = MC (Price > MC)\nRegulation of industries with declining costs\nMay need to segment markets and have differential\npricing in order to cover total costs\n\nFixed vs. Variable Costs\nFixed Costs\nUnaffected by changes in activity level over a feasible\nrange of operations for a given capacity or capability\nover a reasonable time period\nFor greater changes in activity levels, or for shutdowns,\nthe fixed cost can of course vary\nExamples: insurance, rent, CEO salary\nVariable Costs\nVary with the level of activity\nExamples: construction labor, fuel costs, supplies\nIncremental Costs\nAdded costs for increment of activity\n\nFixed, Variable, and Incremental Costs\nTotal Cost (V) = Fixed Cost + f(volume)\nAvg. Cost (V) = Fixed Cost/V + f(volume)/V\nIncremental Cost(V0,V1) = f(V1) - f(v0)\nMarginal Cost (V) = d(Total Cost)/dV = f'(V)\n(Assuming we in fact have a differentiable\nfunction for variable costs!)\n\nLong-Run & Short-Run Costs\nLong-run costs\nAll inputs can vary to get the optimal cost\nBecause of time delays in reaching equilibrium and the\nhigh costs of changing transportation infrastructure, this\nmay be a rather idealized concept in many systems!\nShort-run costs\nSome (possibly many) inputs are fixed\nThe short-run cost function assumes that the optimal\ncombination of the optional inputs are used together\nwith the fixed inputs\n\nA Simple, Linear Cost Function:\nTC = a + bV = 50 + V, 10 <V<100\nTC\nVC\nFC\nVolume\nCost\nFC\nVC\nTC\n\nA Simple, Linear Cost Function:\nAvg Cost = a/V + b = 50/V + 1\nMarginal Cost (V)= d(TC)dv = b = 1\nMarginal Cost\nAverage Cost\nVolume\nCost\nAverage Cost\nMarginal Cost\n\nClassic Tradeoff: Can we afford higher\nfixed costs in order to get lower\nvariable costs?\nBreakeven point B is where TC1 = TC2\nTC2 = 95 + V/2\nTC = 50 + V\nB\nVolume\nCost\nTC Base\nTC High Tech\n\nMore Comments - CEE Projects\nTypical major projects reduce both marginal and\naverage costs per unit of capacity\nWill there be sufficient demand to allow prices that\ncover average costs?\nIn general, smaller projects will be better at low\nvolumes until poor service and congestion hurt\nperformance\nVolume\nCost\nBase\nLarge Project\n\nSome Other Cost Terminology\nOpportunity Cost\nA key economic concept! What else could be done with these\nresources?\nSunk Cost\nExpenditures that cannot be recovered and that are common to all\noptions and therefore can be ignored (\"focus on the differences\")\nDirect, Indirect, and Standard Costs\nDirect - easily related to a measurable activity or output\nExcavation cost/cu. yd.\nIndirect (or overhead or burden) -ther costs related to the overall\noperation\nUtilities, marketing, property tax\nStandard costs - used in budgeting, estimating & control\n\nRecurring vs. Non-recurring costs\nRecurring - repetitive; could be fixed or variable\nNon-recurring - typically the one-time expense of\ngetting started\nCost vs. Expense\n\"Expense\" is a specific cash or other expenditure that\ncan be followed in the accounting system\nDepreciation is a non-cash expense - according to tax\nrules\nRepayment of principal on a loan is definitely cash, but\nnot a current expense item\n\"Cost\" can refer to non-financial matters, such as lost\ntime, aggravation, or pollution\nEven More Cost Terminology\n\nSpecial Characteristics of\nTransportation Costs\n- Infrastructure and equipment last a long time:\n- Life cycle costing\n- Deterioration rates, condition assessment, and\nneed for maintenance and rehabilitation\n- Transportation takes place over a network:\nspace is critical!\n- Cost of network vs. cost of operation\n- Congestion\n- Output is complex\n\nLifecycle Cost - Greatest Potential For\nLifecycle Savings is in Design!\nDesign\nConstruct\nExpand\nOperate\nDecommission\nSalvage\nTime\n-10\nAnnual Expense\nEasy to modify\ndesign and\nmaterials\nLimited ability to\nmodify infrastructure\nor operation\nFew options -\ncost already\nincurred\nStill possible to make some\nmodifications in design or\nmaterials\n\nNet Present Value (NPV)\nThe NPV is an estimate of the current value of future\nnet benefits:\nGiven:\nFuture Value (t) = B(t) - C(t)\nDiscount Rate = i\nThen\nNPV(t) = (B(t) - C(t))/(1 + i)t after t years\nNPV(cash flows) = Σ((B(t) - C(t))/(1 + i)t)\n\nAnnuity\nAn annuity is a sequence of equal payments over a\nperiod of time. To find an annuity that is equivalent to\nan arbitrary sequence of cash flows\n- Step 1: convert cash flows to NPV\n- Step 2: convert NPV to an annuity A:\nA = NPV * (A/P, i , N)\n= NPV * i * (1+i)N /((1+i)N -1)\n= PMT(NPV, i , N) (in Excel)\n\nYear\n-40\n-30\n-20\n-10\nMillions of Dollars\nYear\nMillions of Dollars\nCash Flows, NPV, and Equivalent\nUniform Annual Net Benefits\nNPV\nEUANB\n\nNetwork Considerations\n- How best to structure the network?\n- Economies of scale\n- Economies of density\n- Economies of scope\n- Congestion\n- Cost to users\n- Cost to operators\n- Relationship to capacity\n\nEconomies of Scale\nSource: US Army Corps of Engineers\nAverage costs may decline and markets expand if the network is larger.\nCorps of engineers is responsible for all inland waterway projects,\nincluding extending portions available handle larger shipments.\n\nEconomies of Density\nIt may be cheaper to handle traffic on\none facility rather than two:\nC(V1 + V2) < C(V1) + C(V2)\nLarger grain elevators,\nfewer branch lines, longer\ntruck trips from the farm\nCoal trains at UP fueling facility\nin North Platte; triple track line\nhandles 150 trains/day\nPhotograph of coal trains on parallel tracks.\nImage removed due to copyright restrictions.\nPhotograph of tracks\nleading to grain elevator.\nImage removed due to\ncopyright restrictions.\n\nGraph\nshow\ning v\nariat\nion i\nn tra\nvel t\nime b\nased\non de\npartu\nre ti\nme.\nFigure by MIT OCW.\n\nTriple transport tiers in a gorge - interstate plus bike path\non opposite side of river from Amtrak (Colorado)\nEconomies of Scope\nIt may be cheaper to\nprovide facilities for\nmultiple services than\nto provide separate\nfacilities for both.\nHighways serve auto,\nbus and many kinds of\ntrucks; transport\nprojects can service\nmultiple modes, plus\nfiber optics, and other\nfunctions.\nPhotograph removed due to copyright\nrestrictions.\n\nOutput is Complex -\nWhat Measures Are Needed?\n- Cost per trip?\n- Cost per passenger or per ton?\n- Cost per vehicle-mile?\n- Cost per passenger-mile or ton-mile?\nAll will be useful for something!\n\nMethods of Estimating Costs\nAccounting\nAllocate expense categories to services provided using:\nDetailed cost data from accounting systems\nActivity data from operating MIS\nEngineering\nKnowledge of technology (possibly new technology) and\noperating capabilities\nPrices of inputs\nEconometric\nKnowledge of total costs for a varied set of firms or\nconditions\nAggregate data representing inputs and system\ncharacteristics\n\nAccounting Costs\nEvery company and organization will have some sort of\naccounting system to keep track of expenses by (very\ndetailed) categories\nThese costs can readily (and possibly correctly or at least\nreasonably) be allocated to various activities, such as:\nnumber of shipments\nnumber of terminal movements\nvehicle-miles\nThis allows a quick way to estimate the average costs\nassociated with each activity, which can be used to build a\ncost model (which can be quite useful even though they tend\nto be disparaged by both engineers and economists!)\nRefinements can reflect which elements of expense are fixed\nand which are variable\n\nExample of the Accounting Approach\nD.L.

Martland\n\nPU & D Examples\nRail boxcar service to customers on light density lines\nPer unit costs are so high that this traffic is more efficiently served\nby truck, which led to abandonment of roughly a third of the rail\nnetwork\nExpress parcel service is a leading user of technology\nTo make the PU&D work, they need to minimize the time and\neffort required (for customer and carrier)\nStrategic alliances are possible\nAirborne express focuses on business customer for overnight\nservices\nUSPS already has a vast delivery network to residences\nAirborne and USPS have teamed up for priority small package\nservices\nThe highly visible airport access problem is a problem of\nPU&D of airline passengers\n\nTerminal Costs\n-\nConstruction and land (as for route)\n-\nMaintenance\n-\nCrew and equipment (fixed plus\nvariable)\n-\nManagement & clerical\n-\nDetention time for road vehicles and\ntheir crews\n-\nDetention time for passengers or\nfreight\nGoal: maximum utilization up to capacity\nconstraint (delays during peak period\nmust be acceptable)\n\nClassic Problem of Terminal Management:\nCost of Capacity vs. Cost of Delay\nDemand/hr or Queue\n10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24\nHour of Day\nCapacity\nDemand\nQueue\n\nClassic Problem of Terminal Management:\nCost of Capacity vs. Cost of Delay\n- Size of Facility\n- Personnel: supervisors, crews, etc.\n- Ability to handle queues\n- Ability to divert traffic to other terminals\n- Time required in terminal\n- Crews\n- Vehicles\n- Passengers or Freight\n- Quality and timeliness of information\n\nClassic Problem of Terminal Management:\nCost of Capacity vs. Cost of Delay\n-\nResources & their unit costs\n-\nIncremental utilization rate\n-\nSustainable utilization rate for the\nfacility (time for maintenance,\nrecovery from incidents, and dealing\nwith peak demands)\n- Managers and planners: 90%\n- Practical limit: 70%\n-\nIncremental benefit for each\nresource\n-\nAdd resources if incremental benefit\njustifies incremental cost\nUtilization of Incremental\nResource\n9 10 11 12\nNumber of Resources Available\nMax Required\nMin Required\n\nTerminal Examples\nOcean container shipping\nCarriers want very large ships that are larger\nthan what the ports can handle\nWhat is best for the system?\nAirports located far from downtown may be\nonly option, but these increase access costs\nLTL companies created vast networks with\n600+ terminals across the US in order to\nhighlight local presence - but costs proved\ntoo high and they have since consolidated\n\nTransportation\nCosts &\nProductivity\n- Important\n- Complex\n- Interesting\nPhotograph of roads and highways at the\nbase of mountains.

Wilson\n1.201, Fall 2006\nLecture 10\nOther Arguments Supporting Transit\n- Transit allows agglomeration of economic activity in cities:\n-\nNew York, Boston, San Francisco, etc. could not have developed\nwithout transit\n-\nThe current contribution of earlier investments in heavy rail is not\nvalued today appropriately\n-\nNew investments bound to have a lasting impact - thus the need\nfor a long view\n\nNigel H.M. Wilson\n1.201, Fall 2006\nLecture 10\nOther Arguments Supporting Transit\n- Transit is a most effective tool to decrease external costs\nin cities:\n-\nThese costs may exceed $1,000 per person per year\n(Ref: External Costs Study for the Basque Country, 2006)\n-\nThey correspond in order of importance to accident-related\ncosts, impacts on human health, congestion, noise impacts and\nthe current market value of global warming\n\nNigel H.M.
