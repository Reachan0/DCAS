It was designed as a distance-education course for engineers and scientists in the workplace.\nSignals and Systems is an introduction to analog and digital signal processing, a topic that forms an integral part of engineering systems in many diverse areas, including seismic data processing, communications, speech processing, image processing, defense electronics, consumer electronics, and consumer products.\nThe course presents and integrates the basic concepts for both continuous-time and discrete-time signals and systems. Signal and system representations are developed for both time and frequency domains. These representations are related through the Fourier transform and its generalizations, which are explored in detail. Filtering and filter design, modulation, and sampling for both analog and digital systems, as well as exposition and demonstration of the basic concepts of feedback systems for both analog and digital systems, are discussed and illustrated.",

      "content": "Introduction\nThis first lecture is intended to broadly introduce the scope and direction of\nthe course. We are concerned, of course, with signals and with systems that\nprocess signals. Signals can be categorized as either continuous-time signals,\nfor which the independent variable is a continuous variable, or discrete-time\nsignals, for which the independent variable is an integer. Examples of con-\ntinuous-time signals include the sound pressure at a microphone as a function\nof time or image brightness as a function of two spatial variables. In the first\ncase the signal is a one-dimensional signal, in the second a two-dimensional\nsignal. Common examples of discrete-time signals are economic time series,\nsuch as the daily or weekly stock market index, antenna arrays, etc. While\nthese examples include both one-dimensional and two-dimensional signals,\nour detailed discussions in this course focus only on one-dimensional signals.\nMany of the general concepts and results, however, will be illustrated with\ntwo-dimensional signals, specifically images.\nThere are some very strong similarities and also some very important dif-\nferences between discrete-time signals and systems and continuous-time sig-\nnals and systems. Discussing both classes together provides an opportunity to\nshare intuition and to use both the similarities and the differences as a further\nemphasis of important concepts. Furthermore, as we will see as the course\nproceeds, current technology provides an important mechanism-through\nthe concept of sampling-for converting between continuous-time and dis-\ncrete-time signals. It is often very advantageous to process continuous-time\nsignals by first converting them to discrete time.\nFor the most part, our discussion of systems throughout is restricted to a\nspecific class, namely linear, time-invariant systems. Extremely powerful\ntools and techniques exist for both analysis and design of this class of sys-\ntems. In particular, in discussing this class of systems we develop signal and\nsystem representations in both the time domain and thefrequency domain.\nThese two domains of representation are tied together through the Fourier\ntransform, which we discuss and exploit in considerable detail.\nAs I emphasize in this lecture, it is extremely important to use both the\ncourse text and the video course manual in conjunction with watching the\ntapes. The material presented in the lectures is very closely tied to the text. In\n\nSignals and Systems\n1-2\naddition, the recommended and optional problems in the video course man-\nual have been carefully chosen to emphasize and amplify important issues\nraised in the associated lecture. Consequently, it is extremely important that,\nin addition to watching a taped lecture, you do the accompanying suggested\nreading and recommended problems before proceeding to the next lecture.\nSuggested Reading\nChapter 1, page 1\nSection 2.0, Introduction, page 7\nSection 2.1, Signals, pages 7-12\n\nIntroduction\nMARKERBOARD\n1.1 (a)\nDEMONSTRATION\n1.1\nAn example of an\nimage.

      "content": "Signals and Systems:\nPart I\nIn this lecture, we consider a number of basic signals that will be important\nbuilding blocks later in the course. Specifically, we discuss both continuous-\ntime and discrete-time sinusoidal signals as well as real and complex expo-\nnentials.\nSinusoidal signals for both continuous time and discrete time will be-\ncome important building blocks for more general signals, and the representa-\ntion using sinusoidal signals will lead to a very powerful set of ideas for repre-\nsenting signals and for analyzing an important class of systems. We consider a\nnumber of distinctions between continuous-time and discrete-time sinusoidal\nsignals. For example, continuous-time sinusoids are always periodic. Further-\nmore, a time shift corresponds to a phase change and vice versa. Finally, if we\nconsider the family of continuous-time sinusoids of the form A cos wot for dif-\nferent values of wo, the corresponding signals are distinct. The situation is\nconsiderably different for discrete-time sinusoids. Not all discrete-time sinu-\nsoids are periodic. Furthermore, while a time shift can be related to a change\nin phase, changing the phase cannot necessarily be associated with a simple\ntime shift for discrete-time sinusoids. Finally, as the parameter flo is varied in\nthe discrete-time sinusoidal sequence Acos(flon + 4), two sequences for\nwhich the frequency flo differs by an integer multiple of 27r are in fact indistin-\nguishable.\nAnother important class of signals is exponential signals. In continuous\ntime, real exponentials are typically expressed in the form cet, whereas in dis-\ncrete time they are typically expressed in the form ca\".\nA third important class of signals discussed in this lecture is continuous-\ntime and discrete-time complex exponentials. In both cases the complex ex-\nponential can be expressed through Euler's relation in the form of a real and\nan imaginary part, both of which are sinusoidal with a phase difference of 'N/2\nand with an envelope that is a real exponential. When the magnitude of the\ncomplex exponential is a constant, then the real and imaginary parts neither\ngrow nor decay with time; in other words, they are purely sinusoidal. In this\ncase for continuous time, the complex exponential is periodic. For discrete\n\nSignals and Systems\n2-2\ntime the complex exponential may or may not be periodic depending on\nwhether the sinusoidal real and imaginary components are periodic.\nIn addition to the basic signals discussed in this lecture, a number of ad-\nditional signals play an important role as building blocks.

      "content": "Signals and Systems:\nPart II\nIn addition to the sinusoidal and exponential signals discussed in the previous\nlecture, other important basic signals are the unit step and unit impulse. In\nthis lecture, we discuss these signals and then proceed to a discussion of sys-\ntems, first in general and then in terms of various classes of systems defined\nby specific system properties.\nThe unit step, both for continuous and discrete time, is zero for negative\ntime and unity for positive time. In discrete time the unit step is a well-defined\nsequence, whereas in continuous time there is the mathematical complication\nof a discontinuity at the origin. A similar distinction applies to the unit im-\npulse. In discrete time the unit impulse is simply a sequence that is zero ex-\ncept at n = 0, where it is unity. In continuous time, it is somewhat badly be-\nhaved mathematically, being of infinite height and zero width but having a\nfinite area.\nThe unit step and unit impulse are closely related. In discrete time the\nunit impulse is the first difference of the unit step, and the unit step is the run-\nning sum of the unit impulse. Correspondingly, in continuous time the unit im-\npulse is the derivative of the unit step, and the unit step is the running integral\nof the impulse. As stressed in the lecture, the fact that it is a first difference\nand a running sum that relate the step and the impulse in discrete time and a\nderivative and running integral that relate them in continuous time should not\nbe misinterpreted to mean that a first difference is a good \"representation\" of\na derivative or that a running sum is a good \"representation\" of a running inte-\ngral. Rather, for this particular situation those operations play corresponding\nroles in continuous time and in discrete time.\nAs indicated above, there are a variety of mathematical difficulties with\nthe continuous-time unit step and unit impulse that we do not attempt to ad-\ndress carefully in these lectures. This topic is treated formally mathematically\nthrough the use of what are referred to as generalized functions, which is a\nlevel of formalism well beyond what we require for our purposes. The essen-\ntial idea, however, as discussed in Section 3.7 of the text, is that the important\naspect of these functions, in particular of the impulse, is not what its value is\nat each instant of time but how it behaves under integration.\n\nSignals and Systems\n3-2\nIn this lecture we also introduce systems. In their most general form, sys-\ntems are hard to deal with analytically because they have no particular prop-\nerties to exploit. In other words, general systems are simply too general. We\ndefine, discuss, and illustrate a number of system properties that we will find\nuseful to refer to and exploit as the lectures proceed, among them memory,\ninvertibility, causality, stability, time invariance, and linearity. The last two,\nlinearity and time invariance, become particularly significant from this point\non. Somewhat amazingly, as we'll see, simply knowing that a system is linear\nand time-invariant affords us an incredibly powerful array of tools for analyz-\ning and representing it. While not all systems have these properties, many do,\nand those that do are often easiest to understand and implement. Consequent-\nly, both continuous-time and discrete-time systems that are linear and time-\ninvariant become extremely significant in system design, implementation, and\nanalysis in a broad array of applications.\nSuggested Reading\nSection 2.4.1, The Discrete-Time Unit Step and Unit Impulse Sequences, pages\n26-27\nSection 2.3.2, The Continuous-Time Unit Step and Unit Impulse Functions,\npages 22-25\nSection 2.5, Systems, pages 35-39\nSection 2.6, Properties of Systems, pages 39-45\n\nSignals and Systems: Part II\nS[n\nu [n] -u[n-i]\nn\nO0I\nu [n]\nu [n - I]\nu [n]-u [n-1]\nTRANSPARENCY\n3.1\nDiscrete-time unit step\nand unit impulse\nsequences.\nTRANSPARENCY\n3.2\nThe unit impulse\nsequence as the first\nbackward difference\nof the unit step\nsequence.\n\nSignals and Systems\n3-4\nTRANSPARENCY\n3.3\nThe unit step sequence\nas the running sum of\nthe unit impulse.\nTRANSPARENCY\n3.4\nThe unit step sequence\nexpressed as a\nsuperposition of\ndelayed unit impulses.\nn\nu[n]=\nS 8[m]\nms-C(\nn < 0\n8 Im]\nn\nO\nn>O\n8[Im]\n\nSignals and Systems: Part II\nUNIT STEP FUNCTION: CONTINUOUS -TIME\n{0\nt < 0\nu (t)=\nt > 0\nu(t )\nt\nO (\nt\nu(t) = u(t) as A -\nUNIT IMPULSE FUNCTION\n-du(t)\n6(t)\ndd t\n5(t)\n6 (t)\nduA(t)\ndt\n= 5A(t) as\nTRANSPARENCY\n3.5\nThe continuous-time\nunit step function.\nTRANSPARENCY\n3.6\nThe definition of the\nunit impulse as the\nderivative of the unit\nstep.\nA--0\n\nSignals and Systems\n3-6\nTRANSPARENCY\n3.7\nInterpretation of the\ncontinuous-time unit\nimpulse as the limiting\nform of a rectangular\npulse which has unit\narea and for which\nthe pulse width\napproaches zero.\nTRANSPARENCY\n3.8\nThe unit step\nexpressed as the\nrunning integral of the\nunit impulse.\nt)\nA\n8 (t)\no\nt\nk8(t)\narea\n=\nI\nheight = \" 00 \"\nwidth = \"0\"\narea\n=\nI\n\nSignals and Systems: Part II\n3-7\nTRANSPARENCY\n3.9\nDefinition of a system.\nx (t )\nx (t)\nx[n]\nx[n]\nContinuous -time\nsystem\n10y (t )\n-0\ny(t)\ny [n]\n-e\ny[n]\nTRANSPARENCY\n3.10\nInterconnection of\ntwo systems in\ncascade.\nCascade\nXI\nO\nyI\nxi\nSystem\nyI\n~ I\ny\nY2a X1\nyI\n\nSignals and Systems\nTRANSPARENCY\n3.11\nInterconnection of\ntwo systems in\nparallel.\nTRANSPARENCY\n3.12\nFeedback inter-\nconnection of two\nsystems.\nfeedback\nxI x+y2\nx2 =\n\nSignals and Systems: Part II\n6n(FYI Y-\nC-=E39\n(tA\nP 10-\n-t s*'0\nT N\\ ERTAILMT(\nXr~3\nML'\n-V\n?\nT=crse o1 A\nN\n~y)\nCo\nkA%'Q4'\nepevsJi on\nom,-\n*\nPe ;o r\nor*\nIud\n+0\nAt\nTime\nOr .\nS4s4cm can,'t aAtic.,(AA\nor *\nA, C4 --\n'Z C+)\nSame\nFo\nda5rttv-\nTI me\n'\\\nAeo\n\"e\nss.\nEva\"'\nIe-.\nIr3\nCXn&-,3\nt xt\nEt7)\nx Lo3\nl\ni\nex\\\nd\nJr\n-z> -For everbouvded\ninput 'de o ,p\ni\nb outnd ed\nft.t\n-i-i-TILL--- ~rL'\nL-A2\nI'\n~\ny+)IM\nS4-obe.\nMARKERBOARD\n3.1\nC\nLO\nt\nC4 k\n, AC\nd~~c\nP.\nMARKERBOARD\n3.2\n'A\n(T)J-L\n.

      "content": "Convolution\nIn Lecture 3 we introduced and defined a variety of system properties to\nwhich we will make frequent reference throughout the course. Of particular\nimportance are the properties of linearity and time invariance, both because\nsystems with these properties represent a very broad and useful class and be-\ncause with just these two properties it is possible to develop some extremely\npowerful tools for system analysis and design.\nA linear system has the property that the response to a linear combina-\ntion of inputs is the same linear combination of the individual responses. The\nproperty of time invariance states that, in effect, the system is not sensitive to\nthe time origin. More specifically, if the input is shifted in time by some\namount, then the output is simply shifted by the same amount.\nThe importance of linearity derives from the basic notion that for a linear\nsystem if the system inputs can be decomposed as a linear combination of\nsome basic inputs and the system response is known for each of the basic in-\nputs, then the response can be constructed as the same linear combination of\nthe responses to each of the basic inputs. Signals (or functions) can be decom-\nposed as a linear combination of basic signals in a wide variety of ways. For\nexample, we might consider a Taylor series expansion that expresses a func-\ntion in polynomial form. However, in the context of our treatment of signals\nand systems, it is particularly important to choose the basic signals in the ex-\npansion so that in some sense the response is easy to compute. For systems\nthat are both linear and time-invariant, there are two particularly useful\nchoices for these basic signals: delayed impulses and complex exponentials.\nIn this lecture we develop in detail the representation of both continuous-\ntime and discrete-time signals as a linear combination of delayed impulses\nand the consequences for representing linear, time-invariant systems. The re-\nsulting representation is referred to as convolution. Later in this series of lec-\ntures we develop in detail the decomposition of signals as linear combina-\ntions of complex exponentials (referred to as Fourier analysis) and the\nconsequence of that representation for linear, time-invariant systems.\nIn developing convolution in this lecture we begin with the representa-\ntion of discrete-time signals and linear combinations of delayed impulses. As\nwe discuss, since arbitrary sequences can be expressed as linear combina-\ntions of delayed impulses, the output for linear, time-invariant systems can be\n\nSignals and Systems\n4-2\nexpressed as the same linear combination of the system response to a delayed\nimpulse. Specifically, because of time invariance, once the response to one\nimpulse at any time position is known, then the response to an impulse at any\nother arbitrary time position is also known.\nIn developing convolution for continuous time, the procedure is much\nthe same as in discrete time although in the continuous-time case the signal is\nrepresented first as a linear combination of narrow rectangles (basically a\nstaircase approximation to the time function). As the width of these rectan-\ngles becomes infinitesimally small, they behave like impulses. The superposi-\ntion of these rectangles to form the original time function in its limiting form\nbecomes an integral, and the representation of the output of a linear, time-in-\nvariant system as a linear combination of delayed impulse responses also be-\ncomes an integral.

A number of the important properties of convolution that\nhave interpretations and consequences for linear, time-invariant systems are\ndeveloped in Lecture 5.

      "content": "Properties of Linear,\nTime-Invariant\nSystems\nIn this lecture we continue the discussion of convolution and in particular ex-\nplore some of its algebraic properties and their implications in terms of linear,\ntime-invariant (LTI) systems. The three basic properties of convolution as an\nalgebraic operation are that it is commutative, associative, and distributive\nover addition. The commutative property means simply that x convolved with\nh is identical with h convolved with x. The consequence of this property for\nLTI systems is that for a system with a specified input and impulse response,\nthe output will be the same if the roles of the input and impulse response are\ninterchanged. The associative property specifies that while convolution is an\noperation combining two signals, we can refer unambiguously to the convolu-\ntion of three signals without concern about how they are grouped pairwise.\nAs demonstrated in the lecture, the associative property combined with\nthe commutative property leads to an extremely important property of LTI\nsystems. Specifically, if we have several LTI systems cascaded together, the\noutput generated by an input to the overall cascade combination does not de-\npend on the order in which the systems are cascaded. This property of LTI\nsystems plays an extremely important role in system design, implementation,\nand analysis. It is generally not true for arbitrary systems that are not linear\nand time-invariant, and it represents one very important consequence of ex-\nploiting the properties of linearity and time invariance. The distributive prop-\nerty states that a signal convolved with the sum of two signals is identical to\nthe result of carrying out the convolution with each signal in the sum individ-\nually and then summing the result. The consequence of this for the intercon-\nnection of LTI systems is that a parallel combination can be collapsed into a\nsingle system whose impulse response is the sum of the two individual ones.\nIn looking at and understanding the algebraic properties of convolution, it is\nworthwhile to recognize that convolution as an algebraic property relates to\naddition in exactly the same way that multiplication relates to addition: that\nis, multiplication is commutative, associative, and distributive over addition.\n\nSignals and Systems\n5-2\nIn Lecture 3 we defined system properties in addition to linearity and\ntime invariance, specifically properties of memory, invertibility, stability, and\ncausality. While these properties are independent of linearity and time invar-\niance, for LTI systems they can be related to properties of the system impulse\nresponse. For example, if an LTI system is memoryless, then the impulse re-\nsponse must be a scaled impulse. If a system with impulse response h is in-\nvertible, then the impulse response hi of the inverse system has the property\nthat h convolved with hi is an impulse. For LTI systems an equivalent condi-\ntion to stability is that the impulse response be absolutely summable (discrete\ntime) or absolutely integrable (continuous time). If an LTI system is causal,\nthen its impulse response must be zero for t (or n) < 0; furthermore, if the im-\npulse response has this property, then the system is guaranteed to be causal.\nIn the process of discussing these properties for LTI systems, we discuss\nanother very important consequence of linearity-the fact that for a linear\nsystem (whether or not it is time-invariant), if the input is zero for all t (or n),\nthen the output is zero also.\nIn this lecture we illustrate the properties discussed above with some\nsystems. The problems associated with this lecture provide the opportunity to\nexplore these properties further.\nIn Lecture 3 in discussing the continuous-time impulse function, we indi-\ncated some inherent difficulty with defining the impulse simply as the limiting\nform of a rectangular pulse. We also suggested that the important properties\nof impulses relate not to what they are at each instant of time but to how they\nbehave under integration. Specifically, in the context of signal and system\nanalysis, the important property of impulses and what we call higher-order\nsingularity functions is not what they are but what they do under convolution.\nThis operational definition of impulses and derivatives of impulses is briefly\ntouched on at the end of this lecture.\nSuggested Reading\nSection 3.2, Discrete-Time LTI Systems: The Convolution Sum, pages 84-87\nSection 3.3, Continuous-Time LTI Systems: The Convolution Integral, pages\n90-95\nSection 3.4, Properties of Linear Time-Invariant Systems, pages 95-101\nSection 3.7, Singularity Functions, pages 120-124\n\nProperties of Linear, Time-Invariant Systems\nConvolution Sum:\n+00\nx[n] =\nx[k] 5[n-k]\nk= - \"\n+00\ny[n] =J x[k] h[n-k] =x[n] * h[n]\nk=-o\nConvolution Integral:\n+xt\nx1(t)\n=f\nx (r) 8 (t -T) dT\n-00\n+00\ny(t)\n=f\nX(T)\n-00\nh(t-T) dT = x(t)\n* h(t)\nTRANSPARENCY\n5.1\nThe convolution sum\nand convolution\nintegral.\nCommutative:\nx[n] * h [n]\n= h[n] *x[n]\nx(t) * h(t)\nu[n] -> au[n]\nu(t) * eatu(t)\n=\nh(t) *x(t)\n=anu[n] * u[n]\n= e-atu(t) *u(t)\nTRANSPARENCY\n5.2\nThe commutativity\nproperty of\nconvolution.\nI-\n\nSignals and Systems\n5-4\nTRANSPARENCY\n5.3\nThree algebraic\nproperties of\nconvolution.\nCommutative:\nx * h\nh * x\nAssociative:\nx *Ih 1* h2\n= x *h, I*\nh2\nDistributive:\nx * h + h2 =x *\n+ x * h 2\nTRANSPARENCY\n5.4\nAn interpretation of\nthe commutativity\nproperty.\nCommutative\ny= x* h\ny= h *x\nLTI System: output the some\nif input and impulse\nresponse interchanged\n\nProperties of Linear, Time-Invariant Systems\nTRANSPARENCY\n5.5\nOne consequence of\nthe algebraic\nproperties of\nconvolution is that LTI\nsystems can be\ncascaded in any order.\nTRANSPARENCY\n5.6\nOne consequence of\nthe distributive\nproperty of\nconvolution is that LTI\nsystems in parallel can\nbe collapsed into a\nsingle LTI system.\n\nSignals and Systems\nI\n-\n)\nIt\n0 ov ,vro o.4 (4\n->4-k\n(V~ -T\nXNVEMTlI L M\n~400\nV,00\nK0\np4mnpd eSPMC\noJt\nU\n'.~O\n-~Or\nU\nat\n-46~\n-ov- LII\n~ievs\ntV(*)O\nt<0o\nL\\T ea'\n'-t4ety\n,\nvx\n,c \\\n+9A 6\nS0\n-T\nQ74'0\nPcc\ndo.tov-:\n~\n-00\n,j\\n\n,kT-Y3\nYJi~V t\n0 ::::: cz\n00o\nnIIt\\\nCe\n>~ v~oI\n~z\n~-~~*'\n= JL\"N-13 + Nr-v'J\nMARKERBOARD\n5.1\nMARKERBOARD\n5.2\nI\nCOIIASOL I +\n\nProperties of Linear, Time-Invariant Systems\nXCO3\na(cL=8t\nAt+2*Sc*'\nu2 t\ntt\nSCn3*8tn3= 4(t\nS0y zc\"\n-T-\n8t*)\na- f |\nopera.*iadol De4ny+I'OW\njs)\ndXCJ\n+)t\n(;\nC4)\nd t\nXuc+\n* U)\ndt\nMARKERBOARD\n5.4\n\nSignals and Systems\nMARKERBOARD\n5.5\ndkxt)\nd kx(t)\nNote that dxjt\nshould read dt)\nin both places.\ndt\ndtk\nL 0Ct) 8tt)\n-A)\n_ d\nLA. +) =8C4)\nu.

      "content": "Systems Represented by\nDifferential and\nDifference Equations\nAn important class of linear, time-invariant systems consists of systems rep-\nresented by linear constant-coefficient differential equations in continuous\ntime and linear constant-coefficient difference equations in discrete time.\nContinuous-time linear, time-invariant systems that satisfy differential equa-\ntions are very common; they include electrical circuits composed of resistors,\ninductors, and capacitors and mechanical systems composed of masses,\nsprings, and dashpots. In discrete time a wide variety of data filtering, time se-\nries analysis, and digital filtering systems and algorithms are described by dif-\nference equations.\nIn this lecture, we review the time-domain solution for linear constant-\ncoefficient differential equations and show how the same basic strategy ap-\nplies to difference equations. While this review is presented somewhat quick-\nly, it is assumed that you have had some prior exposure to differential\nequations and their time-domain solution, perhaps in the context of circuits\nor mechanical systems. In any case, in Lecture 9 after we have developed the\nFourier transform, we will see some more efficient (at least mathematically)\nways of obtaining the solution.\nIn considering the time-domain solution to linear constant-coefficient\ndifferential and difference equations, we should recognize a number of impor-\ntant features. Foremost is the fact that the differential or difference equation\nby itself specifies a family of responses only for a given input x(t). In particu-\nlar we can always add to any solution another solution that satisfies the\nhomogeneous equation corresponding to x(t) or x(n) being zero. Thus, for\nunique specification of a system, in addition to the differential or difference\nequation some auxiliary conditions (for example, a set of initial conditions)\nare needed that will specify the arbitrary constants present in the homo-\ngeneous solution.\nIn Lecture 5 we showed that a linear, time-invariant system has the prop-\nerty that if the input is zero for all time, then the output will also be zero for all\ntime. Consequently, a linear, time-invariant system specified by a linear con-\nstant-coefficient differential or difference equation must have its auxiliary\n\nSignals and Systems\n6-2\nconditions consistent with that property. If, in fact, the system is causal in ad-\ndition to being linear and time-invariant, then the auxiliary conditions will\ncorrespond to the requirement of initial rest; that is, if the input is zero prior to\nsome time, then the output must be zero at least until the same time. In the\ncontext of RLC circuits, for example, this would correspond to an assumption\nof no initial capacitor voltages or inductor currents prior to the time at which\nthe input becomes nonzero.\nAn important distinction between linear constant-coefficient differential\nequations associated with continuous-time systems and linear constant-coef-\nficient difference equations associated with discrete-time systems is that for\ncausal systems the difference equation can be reformulated as an explicit re-\nlationship that states how successive values of the output can be computed\nfrom previously computed output values and the input. This recursive proce-\ndure for calculating the response of a difference equation is extremely useful\nin implementing causal systems. However, it is important to recognize that ei-\nther in algebraic terms or in terms of block diagrams, a difference equation\ncan often be rearranged into other forms leading to implementations that may\nhave particular advantages. For example, as illustrated in the lecture, the\nmost direct representation of a difference equation in terms of a block dia-\ngram or algorithm is often not the most efficient. Since the order in which lin-\near, time-invariant systems are cascaded is not important to the overall input-\noutput response, the most direct representation can be rearranged so that its\nimplementation requires significantly less memory or, equivalently, delay reg-\nisters. In addition, there are many other rearrangements, each having particu-\nlar advantages and disadvantages. Similar kinds of rearrangements of the\nblock diagrams also apply to the block diagram realizations of linear con-\nstant-coefficient differential equations for continuous-time systems.\nSuggested Reading\nSection 3.5, Systems Described by Differential and Difference Equations,\npages 101-111\nSection 3.6, Block-Diagram Representations of LTI Systems Described by Dif-\nferential and Difference Equations, pages 111-119\n\nDifferential and Difference Equations\nLINEAR CONSTANT-COEFFICIENT DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION\nNth Order:\nN\nE: a k\nk=0\ndk y(t)\ndtk\nM\nk=0\ndkx(t)\ndt k\nLINEAR CONSTANT-COEFFICIENT DIFFERENCE EQUATION\nOrder:\nak y[n-k]\nN\nE\nk=0\nM\n=E\nk=0\nbk x[n-k]\nTRANSPARENCY\n6.1\nNth-order linear\nconstant-coefficient\ndifferential and\ndifference equations.\nNE\nk=0\nN\nk=0\ndky(t)\nM\na\n= -E\ndtk\nk=O\ndkyh(t)\nk\nk\ndt\ndkx(t)\nk\ndtk\n(1)\n(Homogeneous Equation)\n(2)\nGiven x(t), if y (t) satisfies (1) then so does\ny,(t) + yh(t) where yh (t) satisfies (2)\nyp(t) A Particular solution\nyh (t) = Homogeneous solution\nTRANSPARENCY\n6.2\nFamily of solutions for\na linear constant-\ncoefficient differential\nequation.\nNth\n\nSignals and Systems\n6-4\nTRANSPARENCY\n6.3\nForm of the\nhomogeneous\nsolution.\nHOMOGENEOUS SOLUTION\nN\ndkYh(t)\nak\ndtk\nk0O\n\"guess\" solution of the form\nYh (t) = Aest\nN\nE ak A s k est = 0\nk=0\nN\nak s k = 0\nk=0\nN roots s i\ni = 1, ... , N\nYh(t) = A1 esit + A 2 es2t + ... + ANeSNt\nTRANSPARENCY\n6.4\nRequirements on the\nauxiliary conditions\nfor a linear constant-\ncoefficient differential\nequation to corre-\nspond to a linear\nsystem or to a causal\nLTI system.\nNeed N auxiliary conditions, e.g.\ndy(t)\ny(t),\ndt\nN\n-1\nV(t)\n, \"\" '\n..N - 1\ne Linear system <=> auxiliary conditions = 0\neCausal, LTI <=> initial rest:\nif x(t)\nthen y(t)\nat t = t\n= 0 t <to\n= 0 t<t\n\nDifferential and Difference Equations\ne + a\no\ndt~\nA e\nC% :SOk\" 4 t'Ov% ts\nct I\n' ikt LL\nCLo\n+\nLV\nukt)\nS CO\nL\nLt)\nC\nL\no\nCt\nCO\n~&\n'K\nOt\n1 t~~43L&L*\nTRANSPARENCY\n6.5\nFamily of solutions for\na Nth-order linear\nconstant-coefficient\ndifference equation.\nMARKERBOARD\n6.1\n\nSignals and Systems\n6-6\nTRANSPARENCY\n6.6\nForm of the\nhomogeneous\nsolution.\nTRANSPARENCY\n6.7\nRequirements on the\nauxiliary conditions\nfor a linear constant-\ncoefficient difference\nequation to corre-\nspond to a linear\nsystem or to a causal\nLTI system.\n\nDifferential and Difference Equations\n6-7\nENCE EQUATION\nTRANSPARENCY\n6.8\nRecursive causal\nsolution to a linear\nconstant-coefficient\ndifference equation.\nMARKERBOARD\n6.2\n\nSignals and Systems\n6-8\nx [n] -\ny [n]\nD\nD\nTRANSPARENCY\n6.9\nx [n1-|A\ny [n -1)\nDevelopment of the\nblock diagram\nrepresentation of the\nrecursive solution.\nD\nD\nDelays associated with\nthe input and output.\nx [n-2]\ny [n-2]\nD\nD\nx [n-N]\ny[n-N]\nx[n]\nb-\nI\ny[n]\nD\nD\nTRANSPARENCY\nb\n6.10\nx[n-]\ny[n-1)\nIncorporation of the\ncoefficient\nmultiplication.\nD\nD\nx [n-2]\nb-a\ny [n -2)\nx [n -N]\ny [n -N]\n\nDifferential and Difference Equations\nTRANSPARENCY\n6.11\nForming the sums of\nthe weighted, delayed\nsequences.\nTRANSPARENCY\n6.12\nComplete block\ndiagram.

      "content": "Continuous-Time\nFourier Series\nIn representing and analyzing linear, time-invariant systems, our basic ap-\nproach has been to decompose the system inputs into a linear combination of\nbasic signals and exploit the fact that for a linear system the response is the\nsame linear combination of the responses to the basic inputs. The convolution\nsum and convolution integral grew out of a particular choice for the basic sig-\nnals in terms of which we carried out the decomposition, specifically delayed\nunit impulses. This choice has the advantage that for systems which are time-\ninvariant in addition to being linear, once the response to an impulse at one\ntime position is known, then the response is known at all time positions.\nIn this lecture, we begin the discussion of the representation of signals in\nterms of a different set of basic inputs-complex exponentials with unity\nmagnitude. For periodic signals, a decomposition in this form is referred to as\nthe Fourier series, and for aperiodic signals it becomes the Fourier transform.\nIn Lectures 20-22 this representation will be generalized to the Laplace trans-\nform for continuous time and the z-transform for discrete time.\nComplex exponentials as basic building blocks for representing the input\nand output of LTI systems have a considerably different motivation than the\nuse of impulses. Complex exponentials are eigenfunctions of LTI systems;\nthat is, the response of an LTI system to any complex exponential signal is\nsimply a scaled replica of that signal. Consequently, if the input to an LTI sys-\ntem is represented as a linear combination of complex exponentials, then the\neffect of the system can be described simply in terms of a weighting applied to\neach coefficient in that representation. This very important and elegant rela-\ntionship between LTI systems and complex exponentials leads to some ex-\ntremely powerful concepts and results.\nBefore capitalizing on this property of complex exponentials in relation\nto LTI systems, we must first address the question of how a signal can be rep-\nresented as a linear combination of these basic signals. For periodic signals,\nthe representation is referred to as the Fourier series and is the principal top-\nic of this lecture. Specifically, we develop the Fourier series representation\nfor periodic continuous-time signals. In Lecture 8 we extend that representa-\ntion to the representation of continuous-time aperiodic signals. In Lectures 10\nand 11, we develop parallel results for the discrete-time case.\n\nSignals and Systems\n7-2\nThe continuous-time Fourier series expresses a periodic signal as a lin-\near combination of harmonically related complex exponentials. Alternatively,\nit can be expressed in the form of a linear combination of sines and cosines or\nsinusoids of different phase angles. In these lectures, however, we will use al-\nmost exclusively the complex exponential form. The equation describing the\nrepresentation of a time function as a linear combination of complex expo-\nnentials is commonly referred to as the Fourier synthesis equation, and the\nequation specifying how the coefficients are determined in terms of the time\nfunction is referred to as the Fourier series analysis equation. To illustrate\nthe Fourier series, we focus in this lecture on the Fourier series representa-\ntion of a periodic square wave.\nThe fact that a square wave which is discontinuous can be \"built\" as a lin-\near combination of sinusoids at harmonically related frequencies is some-\nwhat astonishing. In fact, as we add terms in the Fourier series representa-\ntion, we achieve an increasingly better approximation to the square wave\nexcept at the discontinuities; that is, as the number of terms becomes infinite,\nthe Fourier series converges to the square wave at every value of T except at\nthe discontinuities. However, for this example and more generally for period-\nic signals that are square-integrable, the error between the original signal and\nthe Fourier series representation is negligible, in practical terms, in the sense\nthat this error in the limit has zero energy. In the lecture, some of these con-\nvergence issues are touched on with the objective of developing insight into\nthe behavior of the Fourier series rather than representing an attempt to fo-\ncus formally on the mathematics.\nThe Fourier series for periodic signals also provides the key to represent-\ning aperiodic signals through a linear combination of complex exponentials.\nThis representation develops out of the very clever notion of representing an\naperiodic signal as a periodic signal with an increasingly large period. As the\nperiod becomes larger, the Fourier series becomes in the limit the Fourier in-\ntegral or Fourier transform, which we begin to develop in the next lecture.\nSuggested Reading\nSection 4.0, Introduction, pages 161-166\nSection 4.1, The Response of Continuous-Time LTI Systems to Complex Ex-\nponentials, pages 166-168\nSection 4.2, Representation of Periodic Signals: The Continuous-Time Fourier\nSeries, pages 168-179\nSection 4.3, Approximation of Periodic Signals Using Fourier Series and the\nConvergence of Fourier Series, pages 179-185\n\nContinuous-Time Fourier Series\nx ( ]\nx [n]\ny (t)\ny [n]\nIf:\nx(t) = a, 0, (t) + a2 0 2 (t) +\nek(t)\nk(t)\nand system is linear\nThen: y(t) = a, 0 1 (t) + a2 0 2 (t) +\nIdentical for discrete-time\nx= a, 1 +a2 02 +.\nThen: y = a, 01 + a2+'...\nChoose $k (t) or $k [n] so that:\n- a broad class of signals can be\nconstructed as a linear combination\nOf $k's\n- response to #k's easy to compute\nTRANSPARENCY\n7.1\nThe principle of\nsuperposition for\nlinear systems.\nTRANSPARENCY\n7.2\nCriteria for choosing a\nset of basic signals in\nterms of which to\ndecompose the input\nto a linear system.\nIf:\n\nSignals and Systems\nTRANSPARENCY\n7.3\nChoice for the basic\nsignals that led to the\nconvolution integral\nand convolution sum.\nLTI SYSTEMS:\ne C-T: $k (t) = 5(t - kA)\n4 k(t) = h(t - kA)\n=> Convolution Integral\neD-T: #k [n] = 6 [n - k]\nk[n] =h[n-k]\n=> Convolution Sum\nTRANSPARENCY\n7.4\nComplex exponentials\nas a set of basic\nsignals.\n$k (t)\n= eskt\nk [n] = Zk n\nsk complex\nzk complex\nFourier Analysis:\n*C-T:\nsk ~ jwk\n*D-T:\nIzkI = 1\nskcomplex\nzk complex\nk (t)\n= eikt\nkk [n] = e 9kn\n=> Laplace transforms\n=> z-transforms\n\nContinuous-Time Fourier Series\nMARKERBOARD\n7.1\nProos 0\n\"\n~Pr, O;5,\n*yj\n-\np\ne -r-\n1 .o or ',\nC*T ;earier Seeres\nWct -'At+T.)-\nTOU\ne ?\npe i4-\n'I\nPer lea,\nC'\ncV\nk\n.t\na.+\n' Ak cs(k\nw.4+ ev\nkms\noL'\nF'13 GuO0MVe4\n*\nr\niv>'\n.\nThe minus sign at the beginning of the exponent at the bottom of column 1 is incorrect; dt should\nbe included at the end of the analysis integral at the bottom of column 2.\n&dt\n=\no\n0o\na, e\nT6k\nMARKERBOARD\n7.2\nO e\ndt\nC-.. 16\n0 T\n'k~\n___j\n\nSignals and Systems\nTRANSPARENCY\n7.5\nDetermination of the\nFourier series\ncoefficients for an\nantisymmetric\nperiodic square wave.\nANTISYMMETRIC PERIODIC SQUARE WAVE\nx(t)\nT o\nTo\nak\n1-(-1)e-jk\nTfot\ndt +\nt\n(+ 1) e- jkwot dt\nj\n-(-1)ki\nk/#0\na\nx(t) e- jkwot dt=\nf x(t) dt = 0\nTo\nTOTo\nTRANSPARENCY\n7.6\nThe Fourier series\ncoefficients for an\nantisymmetric\nperiodic square wave.\nANTISYMMETRIC PERIODIC SQUARE WAVE\nJ7rak\n-2/5\n-2/3\nao =0;\nak = 1\nk\n(-1) k}\ne odd harmonic\noak imaginary\neak = -a- k (antisymmetric)\nk#0\nsine series\noo\nx(t) = ao + , 2j aksinkwoOt\nk=1\nI\nI\nF----\"\n\nContinuous-Time Fourier Series\nx(t) = E\nak ejkot\nk= - oo\nXN (t) $j\nk=-N\n=27r\nvo-To\nak e jkc)ot\nSymmetric square wave: ak =\nk\nN\nXN (t) = + , 2ak cos kwot\nk=1\nA 4\nX ItM\nK\nA\nx (t)\nTRANSPARENCY\n7.7\nFourier series\ncoefficients for a\nsymmetric periodic\nsquare wave.\nSYMMETRIC PERIODIC SQUARE WAVE\nExample 4.5:\nx(t)\n7r/ 2\n1/5\n-1/3\nak\n1/5\ne\nI\n1/2\nk\nsin (rk/2)\nk# 0\n7rk\n-1/3\n\" odd harmonic\nak real\noak = a-k(symmetric)\ncosine series\nx(t) = ao + [\n2akcoskoot\nk=1\nTRANSPARENCY\n7.8\nIllustration of the\nsuperposition of terms\nin the Fourier series\nrepresentation for a\nsymmetric periodic\nsquare wave.\n[Example 4.5 from the\ntext.]\nF 71\nI\nA\nr\\\nA\n.\n.\n\nSignals and Systems\nTRANSPARENCY\n7.9\nPartial sum\nincorporating\n(2N + 1) terms in the\nFourier series.\n[The analysis equation\nshould read ak -\n1/Tfx(t)e -jk\"ot dt\n+00\nx(t) =\nak ejkwot\nsynthesis\nk =-00\na\n=\nx(t) eikcoot analysis\nkT\nTo\nXN (t)\nN\nk=-N\nak e jkwot\neN (t) =x(t) - XN (t)\nDoes eN (t) decrease as N increases?\nTRANSPARENCY\n7.10\nConditions for\nconvergence of the\nFourier series.\nCONVERGENCE OF FOURIER SERIES\n*X(t) square integrable:\nif f |X(t)12 dt <00\nT0\nthen j\nIeN (t)|2 dt--O\nTo\nas N -\noo\noDirichlet conditions.\nif f Ix(t) I dt < 00 and x(t) \"well behaved\"\nTo\nthen eN (t) -*. 0 as N -\noo\nexcept at discontinuities\n\nContinuous-Time Fourier Series\nFOURIER REPRESENTATION OF APERIODIC SIGNALS\nx (t)\n-TI\nTi\nt\n(t)=x(t)\nAs To --. oo\nTx\n_R(t) -\nX t)\n- use Fourier series to represent x(t)\n- let To-oo to represent x(t)\nTRANSPARENCY\n7.11\nAn aperiodic signal to\nbe represented as a\nlinear combination of\ncomplex exponentials.\nFOURIER REPRESENTATION OF APERIODIC SIGNALS\nX (t)\n-TI\nX(t) = x(t)\nT1\nTO\nIti< 2\nAs To -- oo\ni(t)\nx(t)\n- use Fourier series to represent x(t)\n- let T0-o-ooto represent x(t)\nTRANSPARENCY\n7.12\nRepresentation of an\naperiodic signal as the\nlimiting form of a\nperiodic signal with\nthe period increasing\nto infinity.\n- TO\ncll*. ,\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\nResource: Signals and Systems\nProfessor Alan V.

      "content": "Continuous-Time\nFourier Transform\nIn this lecture, we extend the Fourier series representation for continuous-\ntime periodic signals to a representation of aperiodic signals. The basic ap-\nproach is to construct a periodic signal from the aperiodic one by periodically\nreplicating it, that is, by adding it to itself shifted by integer multiples of an\nassumed period To. As To is increased indefinitely, the periodic signal then ap-\nproaches or represents in some sense the aperiodic one. Correspondingly,\nsince the periodic signal can be represented through a Fourier series, this\nFourier series representation as To goes to infinity can be considered to be a\nrepresentation as a linear combination of complex exponentials of the aperi-\nodic signal. The resulting synthesis equation and the corresponding analysis\nequation are referred to as the inverse Fourier transform and the Fourier\ntransform respectively.\nIn understanding how the Fourier series coefficients behave as the peri-\nod of a periodic signal is increased, it is particularly useful to express the\nFourier series coefficients as samples of an envelope. The form of this enve-\nlope is dependent on the shape of the signal over a period, but it is not depen-\ndent on the value of the period. The Fourier series coefficients can then be\nexpressed as samples of this envelope spaced in frequency by the fundamen-\ntal frequency. Consequently, as the period increases, the envelope remains the\nsame and the samples representing the Fourier series coefficients become in-\ncreasingly dense, that is, their spacing in frequency becomes smaller. In the\nlimit as the period approaches infinity, the envelope itself represents the sig-\nnal. This envelope is defined as the Fourier transform of the aperiodic signal\nremaining when the period goes to infinity.\nAlthough the Fourier transform is developed in this lecture beginning\nwith the Fourier series, the Fourier transform in fact becomes a framework\nthat can be used to encompass both aperiodic and periodic signals. Specifical-\nly, for periodic signals we can define the Fourier transform as an impulse train\nwith the impulses occurring at integer multiples of the fundamental frequency\nand with amplitudes equal to 27r times the Fourier series coefficients. With\nthis as the Fourier transform, the Fourier transform synthesis equation in fact\nreduces to the Fourier series synthesis equation.\n\nSignals and Systems\n8-2\nAs suggested by the above discussion, a number of relationships exist be-\ntween the Fourier series and the Fourier transform, all of which are important\nto recognize. As stated in the last paragraph, the Fourier transform of a peri-\nodic signal is an impulse train with the areas of the impulses proportional to\nthe Fourier series coefficients. An additional relationship is that the Fourier\nseries coefficients of a periodic signal are samples of the Fourier transform of\none period. Thus the Fourier transform of a period describes the envelope of\nthe samples. Finally, the Fourier series of a periodic signal approaches the\nFourier transform of the aperiodic signal represented by a single period as the\nperiod goes to infinity.\nWe now have a single framework, the Fourier transform, that incorpo-\nrates both periodic and aperiodic signals. In the next lecture, we continue the\ndiscussion of the continuous-time Fourier transform in particular, focusing\non some important and useful properties.\nSuggested Reading\nSection 4.4, Representation of Aperiodic Signals: The Continuous-Time Four-\nier Transform, pages 186-195\nSection 4.5, Periodic Signals and the Continuous-Time Fourier Transform,\npages 196-202\n\nContinuous-Time Fourier Transform\nFOURIER REPRESENTATION OF APERIODIC SIGNALS\nx Mt\n(\"\"N\nx(t) = x(t)\nT1\nTO\nIt' <\nAs To -- o\nx(t) -- x(t)\n- use Fourier series to represent x(t)\n- let To---ooto represent x(t)\nTRANSPARENCY\n8.1\nRepresentation of an\naperiodic signal as a\nperiodic signal with\nthe period increasing\nto infinity.\nMARKERBOARD\n8.1(a)\nCw%-nwnsA -TWAe\nFerio.\nSAsDg\nNce\npevb~e.t.\nT\n. 4,)\nr.\n.4\n(00,\n-TO\n\nSignals and Systems\nTRANSPARENCY\n8.2\nFourier series\nrepresentation of the\naperiodic signal 2(t).\n(N\nx(t) = x(t)\n+00~\nX~t\nak e jkwot\nk=-co\nTo /2\nak=\n+f0\na To\nfX\n(t)\nT,\n21r\n=0\n-T\ni(t) e -jkwot dt\ne-jkwot\nTRANSPARENCY\n8.3\nRepresentation of\nthe Fourier series\ncoefficients as\nsamples of the\nenvelope X(w).\n__1\naTO\nDefine:\nThen:\n+ co\nfX(t) e- jkco 0t d\n+ 00\nX(W)\nf x (t) e-i\"\ndt\n-00\nToak\nX(W) I=kcoo\nX(w) is the envelope of To ak\n+00\nk=-co\ne jkoot =\nX(kwO) ejkwot\nk=-00\n+00\nx(t) = 27\nX(kco)\nk\nk=-Oo\nr-KT\n-TI\nT\n(0- .\nT,\n\nContinuous-Time Fourier Transform\n+00\nX(o) =\nx(t) ei jWt dt\nx(t) =\nE X(kwo)\nejkwo tWO\nk=-0O\nFourier transform\n- analysis\nAs To-- oo,\ncoo -* 0 1x t) -\nx (t), we\ndoE -\n+a(\nx(t) = 2\n-2o\nX(o) e jcot dco\nInverse\nFourier transform\n- synthesis\nTRANSPARENCY\n8.4\nThe analysis and\nsynthesis equations\nassociated with the\nFourier transform.\nx(t)\nT,\nX w)\n-- e\" --\n% N\n\\\nI\n\\~\n,.\nTRANSPARENCY\n8.5\nTransparencies 8.5-\n8.7 illustrate that the\nFourier series\ncoefficients of 2(t) are\nsamples of the Fourier\ntransform of one\nperiod.

      "content": "Fourier Transform\nProperties\nThe Fourier transform is a major cornerstone in the analysis and representa-\ntion of signals and linear, time-invariant systems, and its elegance and impor-\ntance cannot be overemphasized. Much of its usefulness stems directly from\nthe properties of the Fourier transform, which we discuss for the continuous-\ntime case in this lecture. Many of the Fourier transform properties might at\nfirst appear to be simple (or perhaps not so simple) mathematical manipula-\ntions of the Fourier transform analysis and synthesis equations. However, in\nthis and later lectures, as we discuss issues such as filtering, modulation, and\nsampling, it should become increasingly clear that these properties all have\nimportant interpretations and meaning in the context of signals and signal\nprocessing.\nThe first property that we introduce in this lecture is the symmetry prop-\nerty, specifically the fact that for time functions that are real-valued, the Four-\nier transform is conjugate symmetric, i.e., X( - o) = X*(w). From this it fol-\nlows that the real part and the magnitude of the Fourier transform of real-\nvalued time functions are even functions of frequency and that the imaginary\npart and phase are odd functions of frequency. Because of this property of\ncorjugate symmetry, in displaying or specifying the Fourier transform of a\nreal-valued time function it is necessary to display the transform only for\npositive values of w.\nA second important property is that of time and frequency scaling, spe-\ncifically that a linear expansion (or contraction) of the time axis in the time\ndomain has the effect in the frequency domain of a linear contraction (expan-\nsion). In other words, linear scaling in time is reflected in an inverse scaling in\nfrequency. As we discuss and demonstrate in the lecture, we are all likely to\nbe somewhat familiar with this property from the shift in frequencies that oc-\ncurs when we slow down or speed up a tape recording. More generally, this is\none aspect of a broader set of issues relating to important trade-offs between\nthe time domain and frequency domain. As we will see in later lectures, for\nexample, it is often desirable to design signals that are both narrow in time\nand narrow in frequency. The relationship between time and frequency scal-\ning is one indication that these are competing requirements; i.e., attempting\n\nSignals and Systems\n9-2\nto make a signal narrower in time will typically have the effect of broadening\nits Fourier transform.\nDuality between the time and frequency domains is another important\nproperty of Fourier transforms. This property relates to the fact that the anal-\nysis equation and synthesis equation look almost identical except for a factor\nof 1/27r and the difference of a minus sign in the exponential in the integral. As\na consequence, if we know the Fourier transform of a specified time function,\nthen we also know the Fourier transform of a signal whose functional form is\nthe same as the form of this Fourier transform. Said another way, the Fourier\ntransform of the Fourier transform is proportional to the original signal re-\nversed in time. One consequence of this is that whenever we evaluate one\ntransform pair we have another one for free. As another consequence, if we\nhave an effective and efficient algorithm or procedure for implementing or\ncalculating the Fourier transform of a signal, then exactly the same procedure\nwith only minor modification can be used to implement the inverse Fourier\ntransform. This is in fact very heavily exploited in discrete-time signal analy-\nsis and processing, where explicit computation of the Fourier transform and\nits inverse play an important role.\nThere are many other important properties of the Fourier transform,\nsuch as Parseval's relation, the time-shifting property, and the effects on the\nFourier transform of differentiation and integration in the time domain. The\ntime-shifting property identifies the fact that a linear displacement in time\ncorresponds to a linear phase factor in the frequency domain. This becomes\nuseful and important when we discuss filtering and the effects of the phase\ncharacteristics of a filter in the time domain. The differentiation property for\nFourier transforms is very useful, as we see in this lecture, for analyzing sys-\ntems represented by linear constant-coefficient differential equations. Also,\nwe should recognize from the differentiation property that differentiating in\nthe time domain has the effect of emphasizing high frequencies in the Fourier\ntransform. We recall in the discussion of the Fourier series that higher fre-\nquencies tend to be associated with abrupt changes (for example, the step dis-\ncontinuity in the square wave). In the time domain we recognize that differen-\ntiation will emphasize these abrupt changes, and the differentiation property\nstates that, consistent with this result, the high frequencies are amplified in\nrelation to the low frequencies.\nTwo major properties that form the basis for a wide array of signal pro-\ncessing systems are the convolution and modulation properties. According to\nthe convolution property, the Fourier transform maps convolution to multi-\nplication; that is, the Fourier transform of the convolution of two time func-\ntions is the product of their corresponding Fourier transforms. For the analy-\nsis of linear, time-invariant systems, this is particularly useful because\nthrough the use of the Fourier transform we can map the sometimes difficult\nproblem of evaluating a convolution to a simpler algebraic operation, namely\nmultiplication. Furthermore, the convolution property highlights the fact that\nby decomposing a signal into a linear combination of complex exponentials,\nwhich the Fourier transform does, we can interpret the effect of a linear, time-\ninvariant system as simply scaling the (complex) amplitudes of each of these\nexponentials by a scale factor that is characteristic of the system. This \"spec-\ntrum\" of scale factors which the system applies is in fact the Fourier trans-\nform of the system impulse response. This is the underlying basis for the con-\ncept and implementation of filtering.\nThe final property that we present in this lecture is the modulation prop-\nerty, which is the dual of the convolution property. According to the modula-\ntion property, the Fourier transform of the product of two time functions is\n\nFourier Transform Properties\n9-3\nproportional to the convolution of their Fourier transforms. As we will see in\na later lecture, this simple property provides the basis for the understanding\nand interpretation of amplitude modulation which is widely used in communi-\ncation systems. Amplitude modulation also provides the basis for sampling,\nwhich is the major bridge between continuous-time and discrete-time signal\nprocessing and the foundation for many modern signal processing systems\nusing digital and other discrete-time technologies.\nWe will spend several lectures exploring further the ideas of filtering,\nmodulation, and sampling. Before doing so, however, we will first develop in\nLectures 10 and 11 the ideas of Fourier series and the Fourier transform for\nthe discrete-time case so that when we discuss filtering, modulation, and sam-\npling we can blend ideas and issues for both classes of signals and systems.\nSuggested Reading\nSection 4.6, Properties of the Continuous-Time Fourier Transform, pages\n202-212\nSection 4.7, The Convolution Property, pages 212-219\nSection 6.0, Introduction, pages 397-401\nSection 4.8, The Modulation Property, pages 219-222\nSection 4.9, Tables of Fourier Properties and of Basic Fourier Transform and\nFourier Series Pairs, pages 223-225\nSection 4.10, The Polar Representation of Continuous-Time Fourier Trans-\nforms, pages 226-232\nSection 4.11.1, Calculation of Frequency and Impulse Responses for LTI Sys-\ntems Characterized by Differential Equations, pages 232-235\n\nSignals and Systems\nTRANSPARENCY\n9.1\nAnalysis and synthesis\nequations for the\ncontinuous-time\nFourier transform.\nCONTINUOUS - TIME FOURIER TRANSFORM\n=1\nX(t)\n+00\nX(G)= f\n+00\nX(co) e jot dco\nx(t) e~jot dt\nx(t) +->.\nsynthesis\nanalysis\nX(W)\nX(w) = Re IX(w)\n+ j\n= IX(eo)ej x(\"\nIm\n(j)[\nTRANSPARENCY\n9.2\nSymmetry properties\nof the Fourier\ntransform.\nPROPERTIES OF THE FOURIER TRANSFORM\nX(t)\nX(j)\nSymmetry:\nx(t) real\nRe X(o)\n=> X(-w)\n= X*()\n=\nRe X(-o)\neven\nIX(co)I\n= IX(-w)I\nIm X(o)\n'4X(o)\n=\n-Im X(-4)\nodd\n\nFourier Transform Properties\n9-5\nExample 4.7: eat u(t)\na > o\na+jcw\nTRANSPARENCY\nIxMe)\n9.3\n1/a\nThe Fourier transform\n1/a/2\nfor an exponential\n-\n--\ntime function\nillustrating the\nproperty that the\nFourier transform\nmagnitude is even and\n1/a\n-a\na\nthe phase is odd.\n7r/4\n-7/4\nIT/2\nTime and frequency scaling:\nTRANSPARENCY\n\\9.4\nx(at)\n-+\nX\nThe property of time\nand frequency scaling\nExample:\nfor the Fourier\ntransform.\n&>tut)~1\n_1\ne- at Ut L\n-I-\n-\na+jo\na 1+ j (J\n1/a\nx(t)\ne\nt\nC\n\nSignals and Systems\nDEMONSTRATION\n9.1\nTime and frequency\nscaling.

      "content": "Discrete-Time\nFourier Series\nIn this and the next lecture we parallel for discrete time the discussion of the\nlast three lectures for continuous time. Specifically, we consider the represen-\ntation of discrete-time signals through a decomposition as a linear combina-\ntion of complex exponentials. For periodic signals this representation be-\ncomes the discrete-time Fourier series, and for aperiodic signals it becomes\nthe discrete-time Fourier transform.\nThe motivation for representing discrete-time signals as a linear combi-\nnation of complex exponentials is identical in both continuous time and dis-\ncrete time. Complex exponentials are eigenfunctions of linear, time-invariant\nsystems, and consequently the effect of an LTI system on each of these basic\nsignals is simply a (complex) amplitude change. Thus with signals decom-\nposed in this way, an LTI system is completely characterized by a spectrum of\nscale factors which it applies at each frequency.\nIn representing discrete-time periodic signals through the Fourier series,\nwe again use harmonically related complex exponentials with fundamental\nfrequencies that are integer multiples of the fundamental frequency of the pe-\nriodic sequence to be represented. However, as we discussed in Lecture 2, an\nimportant distinction between continuous-time and discrete-time complex\nexponentials is that in the discrete-time case, they are unique only as the fre-\nquency variable spans a range of 27r. Beyond that, we simply see the same\ncomplex exponentials repeated over and over. Consequently, when we con-\nsider representing a periodic sequence with period N as a linear combination\nof complex exponentials of the form efkOn with\no = 27r/N, there are only N\ndistinct complex exponentials of this type available to use, i.e., efoOn is period-\nic in k with period N. (Of course, it is also periodic in n with period N.) In many\nways, this simplifies the analysis since for discrete time the representation in-\nvolves only N Fourier series coefficients, and thus determining the coeffi-\ncients from the sequence corresponds to solving N equations in N unknowns.\nThe resulting analysis equation is a summation very similar in form to the syn-\nthesis equation and suggests a strong duality between the analysis and syn-\nthesis equations for the discrete-time Fourier transform. Because the basic\n10-1\n\nSignals and Systems\n10-2\ncomplex exponentials repeat periodically in frequency, two alternative inter-\npretations arise for the behavior of the Fourier series coefficients. One inter-\npretation is that there are only N coefficients. The second is that the sequence\nrepresenting the Fourier series coefficients can run on indefinitely but re-\npeats periodically. Both interpretations, of course, are equivalent because in\neither case there are only N unique Fourier series coefficients. Partly to retain\na duality between a periodic sequence and the sequence representing its\nFourier series coefficients, it is typically preferable to think of the Fourier se-\nries coefficients as a periodic sequence with period N, that is, the same period\nas the time sequence x(n). This periodicity is illustrated in this lecture through\nseveral examples.\nPartly in anticipation of the fact that we will want to follow an approach\nsimilar to that used in the continuous-time case for a Fourier decomposition\nof aperiodic signals, it is useful to represent the Fourier series coefficients as\nsamples of an envelope. This envelope is determined by the behavior of the\nsequence over one period but is not dependent on the specific value of the pe-\nriod. As the period of the sequence increases, with the nonzero content in the\nperiod remaining the same, the Fourier series coefficients are samples of the\nsame envelope function with increasingly finer spacing along the frequency\naxis (specifically, a spacing of 2ir/N where N is the period). Consequently, as\nthe period approaches infinity, this envelope function corresponds to a Four-\nier representation of the aperiodic signal corresponding to one period. This is,\nthen, the Fourier transform of the aperiodic signal.\nThe discrete-time Fourier transform developed as we have just described\ncorresponds to a decomposition of an aperiodic signal as a linear combina-\ntion of a continuum of complex exponentials. The synthesis equation is then\nthe limiting form of the Fourier series sum, specifically an integral. The analy-\nsis equation is the same one we used previously in obtaining the envelope of\nthe Fourier series coefficients. Here we see that while there was a duality in\nthe expressions between the discrete-time Fourier series analysis and synthe-\nsis equations, the duality is lost in the discrete-time Fourier transform since\nthe synthesis equation is now an integral and the analysis equation a summa-\ntion. This represents one difference between the discrete-time Fourier trans-\nform and the continuous-time Fourier transform. Another important differ-\nence is that the discrete-time Fourier transform is always a periodic function\nof frequency. Consequently, it is completely defined by its behavior over a fre-\nquency range of 27r in contrast to the continuous-time Fourier transform,\nwhich extends over an infinite frequency range.\nSuggested Reading\nSection 5.0, Introduction, pages 291-293\nSection 5.1, The Response of Discrete-Time LTI Systems to Complex Expo-\nnentials, pages 293-294\nSection 5.2, Representation of Periodic Signals: The Discrete-Time Fourier\nSeries, pages 294-306\nSection 5.3, Representation of Aperiodic Signals: The Discrete-Time Fourier\nTransform, pages 306-314\nSection 5.4, Periodic Signals and the Discrete-Time Fourier Transform, pages\n314-321\n\nDiscrete-Time Fourier Series\n10-3\nMARKERBOARD\n10.11\nNote that dt should be added at the end of the last equation in column 1.\nMARKERBOARD\n10.2\n\nSignals and Systems\n10-4\nTRANSPARENCY\n10.1\nExample of the\nFourier series\ncoefficients for a\ndiscrete-time periodic\nsignal.\nExample 5.2:\nx[n] = 1 + sin £ 0n + 3 cos 2 0 n\n+ cos (2E2 0n +\n)\nRe ak\niak\nk\nN\nN\n*-IIi\nI:,\na1\n\"1--\n0/\nN\nN\n<%ak\nir/2\n0-TI\n- -\n--I\n- N\nTRANSPARENCY\n10.2\nComparison of the\nFourier series\ncoefficients for a\ndiscrete-time periodic\nsquare wave and a\ncontinuous-time\nperiodic square wave.\nk\nk\n\nEnvelope:\nsin[(2N1 + 1) 92/2]\nsin (W/2)\n-F.1N\n- 20\nNa.\nNao\n27r\nDiscrete-Time Fourier Series\n10-5\nTRANSPARENCY\n10.3\nIllustration of the\ndiscrete-time Fourier\nseries coefficients as\nsamples of an enve-\nlope.

Compute the periodic convolution of xi[n] and x2[n] using No = 12.\nP4.11\nOne important use of the concept of inverse systems is to remove distortions of some\ntype. A good example is the problem of removing echoes from acoustic signals. For\nexample, if an auditorium has a perceptible echo, then an initial acoustic impulse is\n\nSignals and Systems\nP4-8\nfollowed by attenuated versions of the sound at regularly spaced intervals. Conse\nquently, a common model for this phenomenon is a linear, time-invariant system\nwith an impulse response consisting of a train of impulses:\nh(t) = [\nhkb(t-kT)\n(P4.11-1)\nk=O\nHere the echoes occur T s apart, and hk represents the gain factor on the kth echo\nresulting from an initial acoustic impulse.\n(a) Suppose that x(t) represents the original acoustic signal (the music produced\nby an orchestra, for example) and that y(t) = x(t) * h(t) is the actual signal\nthat is heard if no processing is done to remove the echoes. To remove the dis\ntortion introduced by the echoes, assume that a microphone is used to sense\ny(t) and that the resulting signal is transduced into an electrical signal. We will\nalso use y(t) to denote this signal, as it represents the electrical equivalent of\nthe acoustic signal, and we can go from one to the other via acoustic-electrical\nconversion systems.\nThe important point to note is that the system with impulse response given\nin eq. (P4.11-1) is invertible. Therefore, we can find an LTI system with impulse\nresponse g(t) such that\ny(t) *g(t) = x(t)\nand thus, by processing the electrical signal y(t) in this fashion and then con\nverting back to an acoustic signal, we can remove the troublesome echoes.\nThe required impulse response g(t) is also an impulse train:\ng(t) = (\ngkAot-kT)\nk=O\nDetermine the algebraic equations that the successive gk must satisfy and solve\nfor gi, g2, and g3 in terms of the hk. [Hint: You may find part (a) of Problem 3.16\nof the text (page 136) useful.]\n(b) Suppose that ho = 1, hi = i, and hi = 0 for all i > 2. What is g(t) in this case?\n(c) A good model for the generation of echoes is illustrated in Figure P4.11. Each\nsuccessive echo represents a fedback version of y(t), delayed by T s and scaled\nby a. Typically 0 < a < 1 because successive echoes are attenuated.\nx(t)\n±\ny(t)\nDelay\nT\nFigure P4.11\n(i)\nWhat is the impulse response of this system?

Construct a realization of this inverse system\nusing adders, coefficient multipliers, and T-s delay elements.\n\nConvolution / Problems\nP4-9\nAlthough we have phrased this discussion in terms of continuous-time systems\nbecause of the application we are considering, the same general ideas hold in\ndiscrete time. That is, the LTI system with impulse response\nh[n] = (\nhkS[n-kN]\nk=O\nis invertible and has as its inverse an LTI system with impulse response\n(g\n[nkN]\nk=O\ng[n] =\n\nIt is not difficult to check that the gi satisfy the same algebraic equations as in\npart (a).\n(d) Consider the discrete-time LTI system with impulse response\nh[n] = ( S[n-kN]\nk=-m\nThis system is not invertible. Find two inputs that produce the same output.\nP4.12\nOur development of the convolution sum representation for discrete-time LTI sys\ntems was based on using the unit sample function as a building block for the rep\nresentation of arbitrary input signals. This representation, together with knowledge\nof the response to 5[n] and the property of superposition, allowed us to represent\nthe system response to an arbitrary input in terms of a convolution.

Since x[i] is not defined, the signal x[n/2] does\nnot exist.\nS2.4\nBy definition a signal is even if and only if x(t) = x(-t) or x[n] = x[-n],\nwhile a\nsignal is odd if and only if x(t) = -x(-\nt) or x[n] = -x[-n].\n(a) Since x(t) is symmetric about t = 0, x(t) is even.\n(b) It is readily seen that x(t) # x(- t) for all t, and x(t) K -x(-\nt) for all t; thus\nx(t) is neither even nor odd.\n(c) Since x(t) = -x(-\nt), x(t) is odd in this case.\n\nSignals and Systems: Part I / Solutions\nS2-3\n(d) Here x[n] seems like an odd signal at first glance. However, note that x[n] =\n-x[-n] evaluated at n = 0 implies that x[O] = -x[O] or x[O] = 0. The analo\ngous result applies to continuous-time signals. The signal is therefore neither\neven nor odd.\n(e) In similar manner to part (a), we deduce that x[n] is even.\n(f) x[n] is odd.\nS2.5\n(a) Let Ev{x[n]} = x[n] and Od{x[n]} = x[n].

Thus,\n-\n-\n= o-4\nsince\nS2.9\n(a) The sum x(t) + y(t) will be periodic if there exist integers n and k such that\nnT1 = kT 2, that is, if x(t) and y(t) have a common (possibly not fundamental)\nperiod. The fundamental period of the combined signal will be nT1 for the small\nest allowable n.\n(b) Similarly, x[n] + y[n] will be periodic if there exist integers n and k such that\nnN = kN2. But such integers always exist, a trivial example being n = N2 and\nk = N1. So the sum is always periodic with period nN, for n the smallest allow\nable integer.\n(c) We first decompose x(t) and y(t) into sums of exponentials. Thus,\nei(16Tt/ 3)\n-j(16irt/3)\nx(t) = 1 ej(\n21t/\n3 ) +\n-e j(21rt/3) + e\ne\n__A6r3\n____\nj\nY(\njrt -e-jrt\n2j\nMultiplying x(t) and y(t), we get\nz(t)\n-\ne (\n-+/3 -\ne-j5w/s)\n)t(+\n/3)t\n-j\n1/3\n4j\n4j\n4j\n4j\n1 ej(19r/3)t+ 1 ej(13 r/3)t + 1 e j(13r/3)t -\n-j(19/3)t\nWe see that all complex exponentials are powers of e j(/3). Thus, the funda\nmental period is 2 7r/(7r/3) = 6 s.\nS2.10\n(a) Let\n7 x[n] = S. Define m = -n and substitute\nn = -oo\nSx[-m] = - Z x[mI\nM= -OO\nM= -QO\nsince x[m] is odd. But the preceding sum equals -S. Thus, S = -S, or S = 0.\n(b) Let y[n] = x 1[n]x2[n]. Then y[-n] = x1[-n]x 2[-n]. But x1[-nj = -xl[n] and\nx2[-n] = x 2[n]. Thus, y[-n] = -x1[n]x2[n] = -y[n]. So y[n] is odd.\n(c) Recall that x[n] = x[fn] + x[n]. Then\nE\nx2[n] = E\n(xe[nl + x.[n])2\n= x[n] + 2 E\nXe[flx]Xfl + >7 x2[n]\nn= -co\nn=\no\nn= -0\nBut from part (b), x,[nxo[n] is an odd signal. Thus, using part (a) we find that\nthe second sum is zero, proving the assertion.\n\nSignals and Systems\nS2-8\n(d) The steps are analogous to parts (a)-(c). Briefly,\n(i)\nS =f\nx0(t)dt =\nx,(-r)dr\n=0\nx 0(r) dr = -S,\nor S = 0,\nwhere r = -t\n(ii)\n(iii)\ny(t) = Xo(t)xe(lt),\ny(-t)\n= xo(-t)x(-t)\n- y(t),\nx 2(t) dt = f\n= -xo(t)xo(t)\ny(t) is odd\n(X(t) + x0(t)) 2 dt\n=\nx(t) dt + 2\nXe(t)xo(t)dt +\nx 2(t)dt,\nwhile 2r\nx(t)xo(t) dt = 0\nS2.11\n(a)\n(b)\nx[n] = ewonT -\nei2 nTTo. For x[n] = x[n + N], we need\nx[n + N] = ej 2x(n +N)T/To\neji[ 2 n(T/To) + 2rN(T/To)] = ej2nT/To\nThe two sides of the equation will be equal only if 27rN(T/TO) = 27rk for some\ninteger k. Therefore, TITO must be a rational number.\nThe fundamental period of x[n] is the smallest N such that N(T/TO) = N(p/q)\n= k. The smallest N such that Np has a divisor q is the least common multiple\n(LCM) of p and q, divided by p. Thus,\nN\nLCM(p, q);\np\nnote that k = LCM(p, q)\nq\nThe fundamental frequency is 2ir/N, but n = (kT0)/T. Thus,\n(c)\nQ = 2\n=\n=\nWT =\nq\nT\nN\nkT,,\nk\nLCM(p, q)\nWe need to find a value of m such that x[n + N] = x(nT + mT). Therefore,\nN = m(T./T), where m(T./T) must be an integer, or m(q/p) must be an integer.\nThus, mq = LCM(p, q), m = LCM(p, q)/q.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\nResource: Signals and Systems\nProfessor Alan V.
