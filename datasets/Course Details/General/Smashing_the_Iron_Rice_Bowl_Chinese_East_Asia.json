      "content": "Cheng 1\nEmily Cheng\nProfessor Perdue\n21H.560 Smashing the Iron Rice Bowl\n30 November 2004\nChinese Cinema in the 1980s and 1990s\nChinese history, particularly after the fall of the Qing dynasty, has been\nwrought with turmoil and instability, especially in the structure of the\ngovernment. The Qing dynasty was overthrown in 1911 and the Nationalists\ntook over under the leadership of Yuan Shikai, who was named president.\nEventually he made the mistake of declaring himself emperor, which made him\nwildly unpopular among the general population. Following his death in 1916\nwas the \"warlord period.\" China was basically divided into separate regions with\nindividual leaders or \"warlords.\" No one was really able to unify the country\nuntil 1926, when Chiang Kai-shek formed the National Revolutionary Army to\nfight against the warlords. However, the fighting wasn't over after the defeat of\nthe warlords; the Communist party was formed in 1921, and in 1927, Chiang\nKai-shek and the Nationalists began their crack down on the opposition party.\nWith the exception of a few years spanning World War II (the two parties formed\na united front against Japan), the two parties constantly fought each other up\nuntil 1949, when the Communists took over China and Chiang Kai-Shek was\nforced to flee to Taiwan. Even after the Communist takeover, when things looked\nlike they were going to stabilize, indecisiveness and paranoia (mostly of rebellion\n\nCheng 2\namong the people) within party leadership led to several failed campaigns, such\nas the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution. With the entire country\nas \"drama-ridden\" as it was, it is only natural to see that drama reflected in\nChinese cinema. The two films, Yellow Earth and To Live, both reflect life in\ntwentieth century China, but in very different ways; Yellow Earth, being a\nproduct of the so-called \"Fifth Generation Film\" era of the 1980s, leans more\ntoward the non-dramatic side, whereas To Live errs on the dramatic, though not\nso overly dramatic as to stray from reality.\nYellow Earth takes place in the early spring of 1939 in a small village in\nthe northern part of the Shaanxi province. It opens with the wedding of a young\ngirl to a middle-aged man. During the wedding feast, a Communist soldier, Gu\nQing arrives from Yan'an. He has been sent to the village to collect folk songs,\nwhich he will bring back to the Eighth Route Army to sing as they travel. He\nrequests to be housed with a poor family, so he stays with a family (comprised of\na father, Cuiqiao, the thirteen year-old daughter, and Hanhan, the younger son)\nin their cave home. Cuiqiao walks three miles everyday to fetch water from the\nYellow River (Huang He). Throughout the film, Gu Qing helps the family with\nhousehold chores as he tries to gather songs. But his search seems so futile\nbecause all of the songs that are sung seem so bitter. When asked about this, the\nfather responds that there is no point in singing. People only sing if they're\nreally happy or bitter, and it's usually because of the latter.\n\nCheng 3\nGu Qing also develops friendships with both Cuiqiao and Hanhan. He\nexplains to Cuiqiao that in the south, women are starting to choose their own\nspouses. They're also allowed to join the Communist party. Cuiqiao's father\nscoffs at this, saying that if girls were allowed to choose their own partners, then\nthat must mean they are worthless. He believes in arranged marriages. His elder\ndaughter is married, but she suffers; she is starving and her husband beats her.\nThe father knows this, but he won't allow her to come back because she can't \"go\nback on her word.\" The father says that, \"Marriage for a man is happiness.\nMarriage for a woman is sadness.\" Even though he believes this, he still holds\nonto tradition and even arranges a marriage for Cuiqiao. When the betrothal is\nfinalized, Cuiqiao goes to Gu Qing and asks him to take her with him back to\nYan'an; she wants to join the army. Gu Qing refuses, stating that one of the\nconditions of army membership is that you have to apply first. He promises to\napply for Cuiqiao, and to come back in the spring to get her.\nIn the meantime, Cuiqiao's father pushes for the marriage to take place,\nand in early spring another wedding occurs. Sometime after the wedding, Gu\nQing still has not returned; Cuiqiao can no longer wait for him. She decides to go\nto Yan'an herself and try to find Gu Qing. As she is crossing Huang He, she sings\na song of being free and suddenly her singing is interrupted and she disappears.\nOne can only assume that she drowns.\n\nCheng 4\nThe closing scene of the film shows the village in a drought. Huang He is\ncompletely dried up and all of the male villagers pray to the Dragon God for\nrain. Gu Qing finally returns, but the only person to notice is Hanhan.\nThis film took place in 1939, shortly after the Communists and\nNationalists agreed to form a unified front against the Japanese. The Nationalists\nconsolidated their army towards the south in Chongqing while the Communists\nsettled farther north in Yan'an.1 The Red Army was renamed the Eighth Route\nArmy and nominally under the command of the Nationalists, per their\nagreement. During the period from 1937 to 1940, the CCP saw an increase in\ntheir membership from 40,000 to around 800,000 people.2\nChinese cinema tends to fall under the category of \"melodrama.\"\nMelodrama is a \"representation of historical victimization as a social catastrophe\n[that is] registered by narrativizing the subjective and ethical aspect of the\ndrama within an economic interpretation of class relations and by viewing the\nstory's individual protagonist as an overdetermined ideological figure.\"3 The\nstory is always highlighted by a so-called \"fate of suffering\" and an ultimate\nacceptance by the protagonist of the oppressive social order he must endure.4 In\nmore contemporary cinema, the melodrama focuses on sexual difference, in\nparticular, feminine sexuality and its constrictions in society.5 A third type of\nmelodrama described by Browne is Chinese political melodrama. In this genre,\nthe political process is portrayed through a trial that takes over the theme of the\nfilm. In the contemporary period, the political perspective is also contrasted with\n\nCheng 5\nan ethical one.6 This usually then leads to a \"definition of the self and of the\nrelation of the individual to [society].\"7\nAlthough the film was set during World War II when the Red Army was\nbased in Yan'an, its main focus was around a small farm village that was located\nnear the Yellow River. The melodrama was hardly political with the exception of\nthe irony of the soldier's presence. He fails to bring any change, be it material or\nideological to the village. In the end, they still rely more heavily on superstition\nand praying to the gods for help than themselves.8 But even this irony is\nbalanced out by the portrayal of the soldiers in Yan'an. Gu Qing returns to\nYan'an to see liberated peasants dancing and singing optimistic war songs.\nFurthermore, Cuiqiao and Hanhan were very receptive and positive about the\nrevolution when Gu Qing told them about it. The film as a whole carried very\nfew political messages. The Chinese government found nothing so politically\noffensive in the film that gave it grounds for banning.9\nIf there was any melodrama at all, it would probably be of the gender\ndifferences variety. The protagonist, Cuiqiao struggles with dealing with an\narranged marriage in a time when, if she had lived in a different part of the\ncountry, she could have had the freedom to choose her own husband. But even\nthat plot is subdued and emotionless. The whole film is lacking in dialogue. Most\nmessages are conveyed through the folk songs that Cuiqiao sings. Two\nopportune moments for the aspects of a typical Chinese melodrama to emerge\nwould have been the scene where Cuiqiao is forced to marry, and when she\n\nCheng 6\nattempts to cross the Yellow River in her little boat.10 In the wedding scene, all\nthat is seen of her husband is a dark hand extending from off-screen to take off\nher veil. The only significant indication of emotion is Ciuqiao's heavy frightened\nbreathing. In the second scene, Cuiqiao's drowning is shown through the sudden\ninterruption of her singing by silence, and empty shots of the river. Her death\nseemed almost ambiguous.\nYellow Earth is considered a \"Fifth Generation\" film. It was directed by\nChen Kaige and Zhang Yimou, who were fresh out of Beijing Film Academy. They\nwere among the first class to graduate \"post-Cultural Revolution.\" The reason\nwhy the term \"Fifth Generation\" was even coined was that the films produced by\nthese filmmakers were considerably different from the typical Chinese films of\nthe previous generation. The topics of these films weren't \"officially sanctioned\"\nor ubiquitous throughout mass media. Moreover, the cinematography changed\ncompletely. \"Darkness and asymmetry replaced centeredness and full lighting.\"11\nIn Yellow Earth, there are a lot of night time scenes with dim lighting. Inside\nCuiqiao's home, the only things used for lighting were a couple of oil lamps.\nThe makers of Yellow Earth were probably some of the first Chinese\nfilmmakers to see cinema solely as art, rather than falling second to literature,\nlike their predecessors.12 Having graduated from film school after the Cultural\nRevolution, they were exposed to international cinema as well. The visual style of\nthe film looks international, but still maintains its Chinese roots, though it\ndefinitely steers away from the drama of previous Chinese films, which tended to\n\nCheng 7\nbe fast-paced in an effort to fend off criticism that Chinese film lacked\nexcitement.13 In particular, the landscape shots are reminiscent of Chinese\npainting. The majority of the screen is filled with landscape: earth, mountain,\nand rock. The sky fills only the top one-fifth of the screen or so. The landscape\ndwarfs human figures throughout most of the film. Much of the cinematography\nconsists of a series of static landscape shots. Overall, Yellow Earth is not overly\ndramatic. In fact, it is more \"undramatic\" with the lack of activity and dialogue.\nThough it does convey some points related to social issues in China, it doesn't\nuse traditional means.\nTo Live, though made in 1994, 10 years after Yellow Earth was released,\nseems to fit the more traditional mold of Chinese cinema. The film focuses on a\nChinese family and takes viewers through their lives over a span of three\ndecades, the 1940s through the 1960s. It opens in a Chinese village in the 1940s.\nThe protagonist, Xu Fugui loses his family's home to a man named Long'er\nbecause of his gambling addiction. His father has a heart attack and dies upon\nhearing this, and his pregnant wife, Jiazhen, leaves him and takes their daughter\nwith them. Fugui is left alone to start his life over and take care of his sick\nmother. Within the first ten minutes, the film is already filled with drama. Fugui\nmoves out of his home and becomes a street peddler. Upon hearing that her\nhusband had changed, Jiazhen returns to make their family whole again. Fugui\nforms a puppet troupe and travels the country performing puppet shows to\n\nCheng 8\nmake a living. The puppets he uses are present throughout most of the movie,\nalmost as a symbol of all the hardships the family endures.\nThe film starts out during the 1940s, probably just after the end of World\nWar II, when the Communists and Nationalists resume fighting against each\nother. It takes viewers through the Great Leap Forward and ends in the midst of\nthe Cultural Revolution. This film is very obviously a political film because it\nfocuses on these campaigns.\nOne night while Fugui is performing a puppet show, he is interrupted by\nsome Nationalist soldiers and recruited as a soldier. He served for a few months\nwith the KMT, but one day his entire army base is abandoned. He is captured by\nCommunists and serves in the Red Army for a few months by entertaining the\nsoldiers with his puppet shows. This abandonment by the KMT was typical\nduring this period. The CCP had gradually been gaining power since the\nbeginning of World War II, and leadership within the KMT was weak. Having\nonce been the dominant party, they weren't used to being the hunted instead of\nthe hunters, and therefore became more likely to run away from confrontation\nrather than face it.\nFugui returns home to find the entire village has transformed into a\nCommunist town; the Communists have defeated the KMT. Long'er is about to be\nput on trial for being a landlord. Fugui realizes that if he hadn't lost his property\nto Long'er, he would have been the one put on trial. The village leader that\nbreaks this news to Fugui tells him that Long'er burned down the house because\n\nCheng 9\nhe wouldn't turn it over to the government. He told Fugui that his family's house\nburned for so long, and said the wood must have been very good quality. But\nFugui immediately turned around and said that it wasn't his wood, it was\n\"counter-revolutionary\" wood. People were very careful about what they said;\nthey didn't want to get on the CCP's bad side or ear-marked as counter-\nrevolutionary. In the early 50s, the CCP started a campaign to \"suppress\ncounterrevolutionaries\", or people who were supporters of the KMT or had any\nsympathy for them.14 Jung Chang describes in Wild Swans the execution of a\nKMT officer, Hui-ge, whom her grandmother was fond of and had hoped would\nmarry her mother. Chang's grandmother went by herself to the execution\nground to collect his body only to be denounced by her own sister-in-law for\nbeing a counterrevolutionary.15 As a result, her grandmother had to attend a\nmeeting where her neighbors attempted to help her understand her \"faults.\"\nLater, Chang's mother also came under investigation for having KMT ties in the\npast.\nThe film fast forwards into the 1950s, during the beginning of the Great\nLeap Forward. One of the most memorable markers of this campaign was the\n\"backyard steel\" production. Mao proclaimed that they would surpass England\nand catch up to the United States in industrialization within the next 10 years. In\norder to achieve this, he appealed to the small towns and villages to contribute\ntheir share by melting any scrap metal into steel. All villages had a quota they\nhad to meet. In To Live, the village leader goes to Fugui's house to collect his\n\nCheng 10\ncontribution of scrap metal. After the start of the Great Leap Forward, people\nhad to give up their cooking wares for the steel-producing cause because they no\nlonger needed them. All of the cooking and eating was done for the entire village\nin the canteens.\nThe village leader even tries to take the pins that hold together Fugui's\npuppets, saying that it would be enough to make two bullets. Fugui pleads with\nhim to spare the puppets. He says he can use them to perform revolutionary\nshows for the village to boost morale, and the leader agrees. Making steel seems\nto occupy everyone's time. Furnaces are constantly burning to melt what little\nscrap metal is collected to make sure quota is met.\nChang was six years old when the Great Leap Forward started. She talks\nabout how everyday while she walked to school, she and her classmates would\nscour the pathway for any metal objects that could be melted down. The schools\nhad installed large vats on the giant stoves in the kitchen. The stoves were\nconstantly lit, melting down all the metal that the children collected. Teachers\nwould take turns feeding firewood to the stoves and stirring the vats until the\nmetal melted down.16 The teachers were so busy with the vats that there was\nhardly any time to give lessons. The backyard steel industry even went so far as\nto have furnaces outside hospitals. Doctors and nurses had to constantly feed\nthe furnaces, even in the middle of operations and through the night. Chang\nrarely saw her parents because they had furnaces in their offices and they had to\nmake sure the temperature was always high enough to melt metal.17\n\nCheng 11\nTragedy struck during this part of To Live. Like Jung Chang, Fugui's son,\nYouqing had to go to his school to help make steel with his schoolmates. Even\nthough he hasn't had a good night's rest in several days, Fugui forces him to go,\nbecause he doesn't want to look counterrevolutionary, especially since the\ndistrict leader was coming to judge the village's progress. Youqing falls asleep\nbehind a wall and when the district leader arrives, he accidentally backs his jeep\ninto the wall, knocking it over and killing Youqing.\nIn the 1960s, Fugui's daughter, Fengxia has reached the age where she\nshould be getting married. The village leader helps the family by introducing\nthem to a comrade who also has a handicap (Fengxia has been mute since\nchildhood). This man has a bad leg, but he is still able to walk on it and \"run\nwhen he has to.\" The two get married and Fengxia leaves home. During the\nCultural Revolution, it became common practice for marriages to be arranged by\n\"the Revolution.\" Women would join the party, thinking that they would be\nplaying a major role, only to be married off to officers who were looking for\n\"good Communist wives.\" In the book, The Good Women of China, Xin Ran tells\nthe story of a woman who left home to join the Communist Party because she\nwanted to make a difference, and be written about in history books. On the day\nof this woman's 18th birthday, she was approached by some Communist officials\nand given a \"mission,\" which she readily accepted. Little did she know, her\nmission was to marry a Communist officer. She was written about in books, but\nonly mentioned as a wife.18 This happened frequently. Many Communist officers\n\nCheng 12\nhad been married before they joined the party, but had to leave their families to\nserve the Party. During this time, situations were unstable, and the officers\ndidn't know if they would ever see their wives again, so they would remarry\nmembers of the Party, even if their wives at home were still alive.\nFengxia's situation was not as bleak. She and her husband grew fond of\neach other and had a happy marriage. Eventually, Fengxia became pregnant.\nWhen her pregnancy came to term, she was able to deliver the baby, but she\nsuffered from excessive bleeding and died from the loss of blood. The hospital\nhad no doctors because they had all been labeled as intellectuals. During the\nCultural Revolution, intellectuals were seen as elite and were persecuted and\nsent to the countryside because of that. The only \"doctors\" in the hospitals were\nstudents in their twenties who had little or no medical experience.\nDuring the Cultural Revolution, the term, \"capitalist-roader\" was coined. A\ncapitalist-roader was anyone who held any position of power. Mao felt\nthreatened by these people because they had the power to disagree with him if\nthey wanted to. In To Live the village leader was accused of being a capitalist-\nroader, but he had put so much work into making sure the idea of communism\nthrived. A lot of people who had devoted their lives to the Party and worked\nhard to gain their positions were turned on and deemed capitalist-roaders.\nChang describes this as well. The deputy headmaster of her school, Mr. Kan was\naccused of being a capitalist-roader. Everything he had done for the school was\n\nCheng 13\nconsidered \"capitalist.\" Mr. Kan had been devoted to the Party, so as a result he\nfelt he had been wronged and he committed suicide.19\nAt times To Live does seem overly dramatic because it is hard to believe\nthat so many terrible tragedies could happen to one single family. However, the\nfilm stays true to the history. It is likely that if the events portrayed in the film\ndidn't happen to one family, they probably happened to another. Everyone had\nto produce steel; everyone lived through the Cultural Revolution and suffered\nthrough the effects of losing the \"intellectuals\" to the countryside. The film\nemphasizes Mao's large campaigns, and the events that affect the majority of the\nChinese population. The film succeeds in sending a message: that during this\nperiod in China people suffered, and though they tried to remain optimistic,\nbelieving that all the suffering they went through would make up for itself in the\nlong run, it became hard to have faith in the Party.\nTo Live and Yellow Earth are two very different films, both in subject and\nin message. On employs drama to send across a political message, while the\nother attempts to use cinema as art without being overly concerned with\nconveying a specific message. Yellow Earth is not so much a political story but a\nstory of gender differences in traditional Chinese society. To Live serves up a\ndose of reality; it makes people more aware of what went on in China after the\nCommunist take over and shows that not everything was the utopia that people\nhad envisioned.\n\nCheng 14\nWorks Cited\nBerry, Chris. \"Market Forces: China's 'Fifth Generation' Faces the Bottom Line.\"\nPerspectives on Chinese Cinema.

      "content": "(Courtesy of Xuemin Chi. Used with permission.)\nXuemin Chi\n21H.560\n\nProfessor\n\nPeter\n\nPerdue\n\nDecember 2, 2004\nDiscuss and analyze two or three films of different types that discuss historical\nevents. Compare their presentation with that given in written accounts. Which aspects do\nthe filmmakers emphasize? Do they distort the record of the past to produce a dramatic\nstory or to promote a political point of view? Is this practice inevitable in film, or is it\npossible to make an \"objective\" account?\nThe past two centuries have seen China transform herself from an imperial-ruled\nfeudalistic country to a socialist society with \"Chinese characteristics\" led by the\nCommunist Party. These changes were not made without Chinese bloodshed, the last of\nwhich was the June 4th event in 1989, well-documented by \"The Gate of Heavenly\nPeace\". What holds for the future of China? \"China: Beyond the Clouds\", through\npersonal stories in Lijiang, Yunnan, vividly explores the many social conditions and\nproblems China faces in the present and coming years.\nChina in the 1980s\nDemocracy, one of the three 'isms\" advocated by Sun Yat-sen in the beginning of\nthe 20th century, was still the main slogan shouted by student demonstrators at\nTiananmen in the weeks leading up to June 4th 1989. What started as a memorial for the\nousted liberal General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, HuYaobang, soon\nculminated in a mass gathering of students at Tiananmen Square in April 1989.\nEventually, workers, merchants, and intellectuals all showed support for the students'\n\ndemand for modernization and democratic reforms from the government. By early June\nth, after 7 weeks of peaceful protest, the government used armed forces to crush the\n\"Dong Luan\" and restored authority and absolute control to the Communist Party. While\nall those who watched the news will remember the image of a man standing in front of\nthe advancing tanks, \"The Gate of Heavenly Peace\" digs deeper into this event. From\ncaptured footages and interviews with the student leaders, workers, intellectuals, and\nformer party officials, this documentary shows the various social tension and problems\nthat existed in the 1980s under Deng's reform policies.\nUnder Deng's economic reform policies, lives in China in the 1980s had indeed\nimproved since Mao's death in 1979. China was no longer isolated from the world.\nThose who were educated, such as university students and intellectuals had constant\nexposure to the Western world. No longer having to worry about basic needs such as\nfood and clothing, many urban dwellers and intellectuals seek more emotional and\nintellectual freedom. Lives in the rural area improved as well under Deng. Communes\nwere decentralized and once more, farmers were allowed to plant in their plots of land for\nprofit as long as they satisfied the governmental quota. Under this cloak of economic\nprosperity however, many undercurrents of discontent, such as those of the state-owned\nfactory workers, poor intellectuals, and the euphoric students were developing in China.\nDeng's policy of \"socialism with Chinese characteristic\", in other words\ncapitalism, saw a boom in China's economic growth. Supply and demand of the freer\nmarket made the state-owned enterprise less competitive compared to the privately\nowned business. Workers from the state-owned factories were laid off during\n\"reprioritization\" without any social safety net. Their \"iron rice bowls\" were no longer\n\nsecure. For many of the laid-off workers, their lack of technical skills and lazy habits\ndeveloped from working in the SOEs made it difficult for them to find well-paid jobs.\nThis proletariat class, the most important class of the revolution, no longer seemed\nneeded or important to society. Many workers felt disillusioned and angry toward the\neconomic reform.\nWhile the intellectuals had long advocated for economic openness and reform,\npeople without Party connections did not benefit much from the actual reform. Those\nwho gained economically were mainly party officials who had extra information and\nconnections that gave them opportunities of which others were unaware. Many deals\nwere made through the \"back door.\" The intellectual class, many of whom looked down\non such behavior, felt helpless as well. A few brave intellectuals such as Wei Jingsheng,\nwho called for the 5th modernization of china--democracy, were prosecuted and put away\nby the government. Most still had faith in the government and were waiting for reforms\nto take place slowly.\nThe most restless class was the young people, and mainly the educated students.\nMany university students, having excelled in academics, had received only the best\ntreatment from those around them, including their parents, teachers, and peers. They\nwere euphoric and optimistic, having grown up in the years of rapid reform and growth.\nLike Wuer Kaixi (student) points out in the film, young people wanted Nike shoes, free\ntime to take their girlfriends out, to be respected of their opinions. They were seeking\nmore emotional and mental freedom. The students wrote demands and expected \"Dui\nHua\" with the government, hoping to awaken the people around them and boost reform.\nThis expectation alone demonstrates how optimistic the students were at the time. No\n\none had expected gunfire from the government. Hou Dejian (pop singer) and Feng\nCongde (student leader) said during interviews that they were expecting soldiers to use\nclubs instead of guns to clear the square on the eve of June 4th. It was exactly the\nopening reform that had induced such optimism within the society and euphoria among\nthe students. Emotional extremists such as Chai Ling took power and led the student\ndemonstrations to a more radical and irrational path.\nAfter the governmental crackdown of the demonstrators, many people fled the\ncity to escape arrests and prosecution. Zhang Hongliang, a worker, hid among the\npeasants who lived outside of Beijing. The peasants told him that they would protect him\nfrom being arrested by the government, just like what they had done 50 years ago when\nthey had hid the Communists from the government. This irony suggests that perhaps the\nmost rational people during that time were the peasants, who had become apathetic\ntowards the government and its ownership.\n\"The Gate of Heavenly Peace\" attempted not to take sides, but to tell the story\nfrom different angles and societal classes. It does not blindly support the students'\nactions or completely blame the Communist party. By showing the conflicts and\nconfusion among the student body itself such as that between Chai Ling and Wang Dan,\nand the difference between the hardliners and the liberals within the Communist party\nsuch as Zhao Ziyang and Li Peng, this film tries to show the complex issues involved and\nexplain the progression of the events that led up to the bloodshed. It would be more\ncomplete if the producers Richard Gordon and Carma Hinton were able to interview the\nparty officials who were in power at that time, but that would have been impossible\nduring its filming. The Tiananmen Papers, by Nathan and Links, shows a glimpse of\n\nDeng's decision- making progress. One could see the differences between Zhao Ziyang\nand Jiang Zemin in dealing with the student demonstrations, and how Zhao was trying to\nhold on to his power, which he eventually lost. By showing multiple sides of the story,\n\"The Gate of Heavenly Peace\" is a successful documentary because it strives for\nobjectivity. Using recorded footages from Zhou and Mao's funeral, to Deng's visit to the\nUS, and Bob Hope's singing in China, it shows the purveying moods of China at various\ntimes, which books would have harder times in capturing.\nChina in the 1990s\nThe Communists government's actions towards the student on June 4th taught all\nthe Chinese a lesson. It was futile for most people to advocate political reform. Instead,\npeople started looking towards \"money\" and concentrated on gaining material wealth in\ntheir everyday lives. There was no morality to live by because people had lost faith in the\ngovernment and the Communist ideologies, despite their omnipresence in all the towns\nand cities. \"China: Beyond the Clouds\" tells personal stories from a town called Lijiang,\nin Yunnan province, which serves as a microcosm of rural China, and reflects the social\nproblems that face China today.\nSeveral characters' lives are described along the course of a few months. Their\nlives are all connected somewhat because Lijiang is still relatively small. Their lives are\naffected to different degrees, by social problems and conditions, such as gangs, drugs,\njuvenile crimes, China's one-child policy, and its legal and education systems.\nMr. Mu's family can trace its ancestors in Lijiang to the 13th Century. In 1994,\nMu owns a stand that sells pork, which is allowed under free enterprise. Unlike most city\ndwellers, Mu owns a big house with a courtyard and is building extensions for it because\n\nhis business is doing well. His daughter goes to elementary school. Mu's friend, Dr.\nTang runs a self-owned clinic. People from Lijiang go to Dr. Tang because he is well\nknown in the area for his acupuncture abilities. Teacher Zhou brings her infant to Dr.\nTang's clinic in order to cure her daughter's handicap-cerebral palsy. Old ladies of the\nNaxi ethnic group, who live close to Lijiang, visit Dr. Tang for their arthritis pains.\nTang's daughter also runs a self-owned dress shop. Young women who go there are\ndressed fashionably, and they talk about each other's emotions and what is new in town.\nTheatres show movies from Hong Kong and Taiwan for entertainment rather than\npropaganda purposes. Young people, such as Mu's nephew Dragon He, who leads a gang\nof boys, hang out at their favorite places such as the pool hall, the disco and the karaoke\nbars. Every morning at 7, the loudspeakers in Lijiang would announce the official\nBeijing time and start broadcasting central news. Merchants, such as the tofu makers\nwould have been up for hours by then, having prepared for the morning market. Dr.\nTang's wife works for the Communist party street committee, which takes care of\nregistration of residents, as well as publicize government policies, like the one-child\npolicy.\nThe people of Lijiang all had their lives and jobs. They also endlessly interacted\nwith each other through constant visits, either for personal or work-related reasons. One\nnight, Mu's nephew Asan was stabbed to death by a group of 30 boys.\nIn an effort to reduce juvenile crime, which accounts for 70% of all crimes, the\npolice force of Lijiang decided to use Asan's case as an example. Several boys were\narrested and questioned by an inspector without being informed of their or lack of rights.\nThey were denied lawyers or chances to see or talk to their parents. Legal advice is only\n\ngiven in the end of the investigation process when formal charges are filed. Eventually,\nafter many months of investigation and accusations, 4 received sentences, with the\nheaviest penalty being three years in prison while the rest went on probation. The\ngovernment decided that it is best to re-educate juvenile delinquents and would only\nresort to imprisonment as their last option. While Asan's family is angry and\nheartbroken, there is nothing much they can do to change the court's decision.\nBoys, like Dragon He, talked about ways to make money over drinks and\ncigarettes. They also tried heroin, which they obtained from dealers who had suppliers\nfrom Burma. The old women from Naxi tribe remember the time when their husbands\nand fathers were addicted or died from opium. Up to 1950s, opium had been the major\ncrop in the Lijiang valley. The Communist party had successfully ended the opium\nproblem back then. Heroin has found its way back into China 40 years later. In an effort\nto crack down the drug problem, a drug dealer, Hu Weixiong was mass paraded through\nLijiang and had his death sentence publicly announced in a gathering in the town theatre.\nOver 100 drug traffickers were shot in Yunnan that day.\nHu was taken to the bottom of the Jade Dragon Mountain, a day's walk from\nLijiang, to be executed. Teacher Lu and his wife and four kids live on top of the\nmountain. He had paid a heavy fine, more than two years of wage, for having his\nyoungest child, finally a son. Teacher Lu is responsible for all the kids around the Jade\nDragon mountain area so that they can go to a middle school in Lijiang. The school\nbuilding is old and crooked. Many of the children are children of the Yi people, another\nethnic group that survives on farming. Education is not encouraged because of their hard\n\nlifestyles. While Teacher Lu was away for four months for teacher training, the children\nat school lagged behind schedule due to the poor quality of their substitute teacher.\nOne of his old students visited Lu's family, and told Lu that he will leave his wife\nand child in order to reunite with his formal girlfriend, Li Li, who was tricked into a\nmarriage in Sichuan. Li Li, a friend of Dr. Tang's daughter, had escaped from her in-\nlaws family after being beaten, and returned to Lijiang after three years. The couple was\nstill in love and did not care about being married.\nAfter months of treatment for her daughter, Little Swallow, teacher Zhou finally\ndecides to have another baby. This is allowed by the one-child policy since her first-born\nis handicapped.\n\"China: Beyond the Clouds\" depicts these segments of life of the people of\nLijiang. Nothing as traumatic as June 4th 1989 happens in the film, and people's lives\nnevertheless carry on one day at a time, with occasional interruptions. Rather than\nadvocating changes by directly confronting the government like the students in 1989 had,\nmost of the rural people, like those of Lijiang lived with government polices and legal\nsystems even if they disagreed. As long as they had food to eat and money to earn, they\nwere content with their lives. The younger generation seems apathetic and do not have a\nclear direction in life despite their parents' scolding. This film directed by Philo Agland,\nshows the beauty of Lijiang and tells people's stories in a natural way. It does emphasize\nsomewhat on the Chinese legal system and suggests how it differs from what Americans\nwould expect. Drugs and juvenile crimes are mentioned to reflect that it is a common\nproblem China is facing. It is difficult to judge whether this film is objective because that\nmight not be its purpose. The film does not claim that Lijiang is a typical town in rural\n\nChina, simply a small town in China. The stories of the characters do reflect, however,\nthe social problems that we know are prevalent in China today. While a book can only\ndescribe the way of life of the Lijiang people, this film shows it, and thus achieves a\nmuch better effect.\nChina's future\n\"China: Beyond the Clouds\" ends with the arrival of the spring season. Teacher\nLu is teaching his students the importance of knowledge and education. He teaches them\nthat the future rests with them and inspires them to achieve great things when they grow\nup. Despite the crimes and poverty that exist in rural China, the director expresses his\noptimism of China's future through Teacher Lu's words.\nDing Zilin, a professor who had lost her high school son on the night of June 3rd,\n1989, was left disillusioned by the Chinese government and its propaganda system. Yet\nshe still hopes for the day when her son's ashes will be buried with the rest of the people\nwho died on June 4th. She is still hoping and waiting for the government's reversal of\njudgment concerning June 4th. It is poignantly clear that no matter how disillusioned\npeople become, they still have hope because of the mere fact that they are alive.\n\nBibliography\nAndrew Nathan, Perry Links, eds.
