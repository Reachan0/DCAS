  "course_description": "This online textbook represents materials that were used in the first four semesters (two years) of the Mandarin program at MIT. They eventually formed the basis of a print textbook of the same name, published by Yale University Press. The OCW course materials were extensively revised, and at times reordered, before publication, but the general principles of the original remain: to provide a comprehensive resource for the foundation levels of the Chinese language that separates the learning of oral skills from literary (the former being transcribed in pinyin, and the latter in characters). This resource contains the complete online version of the text and accompanying audio recordings.",

Wheatley, 4/07\n\nYongwang zhiqian ('bravely go forwards')\n'Onwards and upwards!'\n\nThe author gratefully acknowledges initial support from\nThe Consortium for Language Teaching and Learning.\n\nii\n\nLearning Chinese: A foundation course in Mandarin Julian K. Wheatley, 4/07\n\nGenesis and acknowledgements\nDrafts for the first few lessons of Learning Chinese: A Foundation Course in Mandarin\nstarted to appear as long as six years ago, and since that time it has been completely\nrevamped at least twice, and then additionally revised or re-ordered two or three times.\nThe resulting work has been used in near final form for several years in the beginning and\nintermediate courses of MIT's regular Chinese language program, and over the past few\nyears, has been made available to the public through MIT's OpenCourseWare. (Chinese\nIV, the last segment, goes online in April 2007.)\n\nIt is not exaggeration to say that everyone associated with MIT's Chinese\nlanguage program over the last five or six years has contributed in some way to the final\nproduct. Students and teachers have gamely put up with earlier versions, some of them\nappearing just-in-time, with no small number of typos and errors. It helped to be writing\nin the new millennium, when pinyin and character material could be produced\nelectronically with proper formatting and illustrations, then easily revised and delivered\nto students from course websites. It also helped to be at an institution where there was\nenthusiasm for novelty and experimentation.\n\nMy colleagues in the Chinese language program throughout the years that this\nbook was being developed have been Tong Chen (陈彤), who started at MIT when I\nbegan there ten years ago, and Jin Zhang (张锦), who joined our small group a few years\nlater. Tong Chen provided the raw text for many of the conversations and narratives in\nthe later units of the book: conversation 9.3 on bargaining for example, the recipe in 11.5,\nand the long narratives on kinship, the Chinese school system, and on his hometown,\nTianjin, all in Unit 12. He also contributed much of the background information and the\nfirst version of the long dialogue in the supplementary Menu lesson.\n\nJin Zhang provided the stroke-order appendices at the end of every character\nlesson, and both she and Tong Chen, in addition to proving raw material, also helped to\nimprove almost all of the Chinese texts, thought up apt examples, noted mistakes in the\nChinese, and made suggestions on the basis of their broad language teaching experience.\nMin-min Liang (梁敏敏), who had taught with us briefly before rejoining the program as\nthe book neared completion, not only edited some of the later material, but scrupulously\nreported errors and typos in the late units as she used them to teach Chinese IV. And\nAmy Liang (梁爱萍), who attended a good number of the classes when the new materials\nwere being used, joined me for tea for many afternoons at 'Au Bon Pain' so that I could\ngrill her for examples and check on usage.\n\nThanks also go to: Li Yongyan (李咏燕) from Nanjing, and later, City University\nof Hong Kong, for gathering examples of nursery rhymes, jingles and light verse from\nher friends for use in the Rhymes and Rhythms section of each Unit; and to Jordan\nGilliland, who as an undergraduate and graduate student at MIT, developed the\nmultifaceted flashCube program that, among its many functions, has allowed students to\ntest themselves on the material in Learning Chinese.\n\niii\n\nLearning Chinese: A foundation course in Mandarin Julian K. Wheatley, 4/07\nFinally, I must acknowledge the people who made this enterprise possible in the\nfirst place, the teachers who covered the same ground as Learning Chinese when I was an\nundergraduate student at Columbia University and gave me my foundation in Mandarin:\nChih Ping C. Sobelman (蘇張之丙) and Roger Yeu (樂亦平).\n\nWhere friends and colleagues have provided dialogue or narrative material for the\nbook, I have tried to remember to acknowledge them by name. Even though I did not\nalways take their advice, and frequently injected my own idiosyncratic views into the\nfinal product, their willingness to assist and discuss issues has made the book much better\nthan it would otherwise have been.\n\nEnrollments in Chinese classes increased regularly over the years I taught Chinese\nat MIT, so that I am unlikely to be able to recall the names of all those students who\ndeserve to be noted for contributions over and above the normal enthusiasm and\nresilience that almost all my students have brought to the task of learning Chinese. So at\nthe risk of omitting a few names, let me cite Kevin A. McComber, who carefully checked\nthrough a number of units and provided useful feedback, and Justin M. Paluska and\nErwan M. Mazarico who over the course of several semesters, regularly sent me lists of\ntypos and other infelicities that they noted in their perusal of the materials.\n\nAfter teaching Chinese for so long and - in the time honored fashion of language\nteachers -- preparing supplementary materials for fine textbooks written by others, I\ndecided it was time to write my own so that I could indulge my own preferences. The\nresult is this book. My hope is that there will be pleasure in it for both students and their\nteachers.\n\n子曰,知之者,不如好之者,\n好之者不如乐之者。\nZi yue, zhi zhi zhe, buru hao zhi zhe, hao zhi zhe buru le zhi zhe!\nThe Master [Confucius] said:\n'Knowing it is not as good as love for it; love for it is not as good as delight in it.'\n\niv\n\nLearning Chinese: A foundation course in Mandarin Julian K. Wheatley, 4/07\nPreface\n\nThe essential features of\nLearning Chinese: A Foundation Course in Mandarin.\n\nLearning Chinese can be divided into four parts: Units 1-4 with Character lessons 1-3;\nUnits 5-7 with Character lessons 4-6; Units 8-10 with Character lesson 7; and Units 11\nand 12. The Character lessons at the point where students can read sufficiently well to\nmake use of graded readers of the sort already available. In addition, there is a chapter\nthat provides some general background to the language, a preliminary lesson on the\nsounds and their transcription, and an appendix on the Chinese menu. Ten essential\nfeatures of the book are listed below:\n\n1. It is for a diverse audience.\nThe book is intended for a diverse audience, specialist and non-specialist alike. But it is\nparticularly conceived for the latter group, for whom language courses are the major\nsource of knowledge of China as well as Chinese. Such students need a course that not\nonly guides them towards basic conversational and literary skills, but also stimulates their\ncuriosity about the linguistic setting of the language and the geography, history and\nculture of the lands where it is spoken. On completing Learning Chinese, students will\nhave a solid foundation for further study of the language, whether in a specialized\nprogram of Chinese studies, or in conjunction with work or further study in a Chinese\nspeaking country.\n\n2. It has a discursive style, with content woven into units.\nThe textbook proceeds discursively, with content organized in units that are made up of a\ndozen or more topics. A unit (including the character portion) may take three weeks or\nlonger to complete. This approach makes it possible to introduce a wealth of\ninterconnected material that can form the basis of engaging conversations and interesting\nnarratives. So, for example, the final unit of Part 1 introduces (among other things) time\nphrases, names and titles, introductions and subjects of study. These are practiced\npiecemeal in the early classes; but later, they are woven together along the lines of the\nculminating dialogue of that unit (in which a Chinese businessman strikes up a\nconversation with an overseas student on a bus in Sichuan). Within each lesson, topics\nare selected so students can build up a conversational repertoire that can be practiced,\npersonalized, and extended from lesson to lesson.\n\n3. It is intellectually stimulating.\nThe textbook is exuberant rather than restrained. Its Chinese content is current and lively,\nwith subjects that range from ordering food to bargaining, from visiting temples to\ndiscussing conditions in Tibet. It is also larded with quotations, rhymes, popular culture,\nlinguistic information, and historical and geographical notes. It is intended to be an\nintellectually stimulating resource for both students and teachers alike.\n\nv\n\nLearning Chinese: A foundation course in Mandarin Julian K. Wheatley, 4/07\n4. Its contents are easily transformed into classroom activities.\nThe selection and ordering of topics is based on the author's experience learning and\nteaching Chinese over several decades. It is guided by what the beginning student is\nlikely to encounter in and out of the classroom setting, as well as by the need to provide a\nbroad foundation of grammatical, lexical and cultural information for future work in\nChinese. It mixes practical topics, such as providing biographical information, buying\ntrain tickets, or giving toasts, with topics of general interest, such as geography, regional\nlanguages and brand names. Such topics are easily enriched with online materials (such\nas satellite maps, photographs, video clips and advertisements); they are also easy to\ntransform into effective classroom activities.\n\n5. It can be used for self-instruction.\nWith occasional help from a Chinese speaker, particularly in the early stages, Learning\nChinese can serve as a manual for self-instruction. It introduces the language\nsystematically; it has extensive explanations about grammar and usage, as well as\nsuggestions about how to learn the material; it provides a pathway for the inductive\nlearning of characters; it comes with the flashCube learning and testing program (see\n#10); and it can be accessed electronically, with a selection of audio files and other\nmaterials from MIT's Opencourseware.\n\n6. Its character lessons can be omitted or used independently.\nChinese is learned more effectively when the enormous task of learning to read in\ncharacters is separated from the task of learning the sounds, lexicon, grammar and usage\nof the language. Because Learning Chinese separates character reading from other\naspects of learning the language, students who wish to study or review the colloquial\nlanguage without reference to characters can ignore the character components; while\nthose with sufficient grammatical knowledge can study the character material alone.\n\n7. It emphasizes reading skills over writing; it teaches simplified and traditional\ncharacters simultaneously.\nThe character lessons focus on learning to read in characters. Writing is encouraged for\nits aesthetic qualities, and as a way to draw attention to the distinguishing features of\ncharacters; so is word processing, which makes use of character recognition skills. But\nthe emphasis is on reading. Rather than selecting one character set as primary (or offering\nseparate versions of character material), both the traditional and the simplified are\nintroduced simultaneously. Given the fact that the majority of characters have either only\none form or very similar forms, learning to read both is quite feasible. For writing\npurposes, however, students should probably choose one or the other as their primary\nmedium.\n\nvi\n\nLearning Chinese: A foundation course in Mandarin Julian K. Wheatley, 4/07\n\nvii\n8. It uses an inductive approach to promote character reading.\nThe character lessons are placed at the end of each unit so that, for the most part, the\nlanguage represented by the characters is already familiar. Within the lessons, characters\nare exemplified first in compounds and phrases, then in sentences, dialogues, and\nnarratives, as well as in data sets that present information in tabular form. The approach\nis inductive. It attempts to provide enough context at each step to make reading possible,\nand to thereby ease the process of familiarization and discourage studying from isolated\nlists.\n\n9. It accommodates supplementary material.\nLearning Chinese is envisioned as the foundation text for a sequence of Chinese language\ncourses, but although it is comprehensive in its coverage, it can easily accommodate\ntraditional or online supplements of the kind that teachers use to enrich a course and\nmake it their own. Nowadays, such materials range from podcasts for listening and blogs\nfor reading to voice-over-IP telephony for actual conversation. These tools can enrich the\nlearning environment but their effectiveness still depends on a strong foundation of\nlinguistic and cultural knowledge.\n\n10. It is accompanied by a learning/testing program called flashCube.\nAssistance in internalizing lesson material is provided by way of a computer program\ncalled flashCube, developed by Jordan Gilliland while a student at MIT. As the name\nsuggests, flashCube delivers through the medium of the computer what has traditionally\nbeen provided by tools such as flashcards, vocabulary and phrase notebooks, and tape\nrecorders. flashCube stores, in a compact and convenient format, much of the Chinese\nmaterial presented in the book, and allows learners to test themselves into and out of\nspoken or written Chinese. At their own convenience learners can test themselves on\nwords, phrases, or sentences, randomly or in sequence, until they are familiar with them.\nThe classroom can then be reserved for more naturalistic practice, for fine tuning, and for\ndealing with special difficulties. flashCube comes with a host of other useful functions\nthat allow the creation of individualized data bases, or instant access to web-based\nencyclopedic information.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\nResource: Learning Chinese: A Foundation Course in Mandarin\nDr. Julian K.
