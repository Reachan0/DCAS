  "course_name": "Media and Methods: Sound",
  "course_description": "This course explores the ways in which humans experience the realm of sound and how perceptions and technologies of sound emerge from cultural, economic, and historical worlds. It examines how environmental, linguistic, and musical sounds are construed cross-culturally. It describes the rise of telephony, architectural acoustics, sound recording, and the globalized travel of these technologies. Students address questions of ownership, property, authorship, and copyright in the age of digital file sharing. There is a particular focus on how the sound/noise boundary is imagined, created and modeled across diverse sociocultural and scientific contexts. Auditory examples will be provided. Instruction and practice in written and oral communication provided. At MIT, this course is limited to 20 students.",

What part does the massive technological and industrial investment in sound play in modern life? In the last several years, responses to this question have proliferated, producing a boom in \"sound studies\": histories of listening, examinations of built and natural soundscapes, analyses of sound media, and the creation of sound art. Our topics will include the impact of technologies and formats for amplifying, recording, and broadcasting sound; shifting conceptions of silence and noise; global soundscapes; architectural acoustics; deafness; property, sampling, and piracy; and the relation of sound to social and political power. Readings in the history and theory of sound practices and media, along with consideration of classic short fiction, plays, films, and recordings that reflect on the problems and possibilities of sound in the era of mechanical reproduction. CMS.407 involves significant participation; this is not a lecture course. To satisfy the CI-M requirement, students will write several papers (three 6-page papers and a revision) and lead two discussions, preparing an agenda for each of these.\n\nCourse Goals\n\nParticipants will:\n\nobtain an understanding of the conditions of hearing and listening in the modern era\n\nsurvey the ways that sound provides shared sensory experiences within established and emerging networks of listeners\n\nacquire knowledge of the historical evolution of audio technologies for amplification, recording, and/or broadcast (stethoscope, phonograph, telephone, radio, internet)\n\nengage with and apply concepts central to the study of sound media formats (cylinder, LP, tape, disc, mp3)\n\nanalyze sound media and texts from aesthetic and historical perspectives in several writing assignments\n\ndevelop techniques of oral presentation and conversation through discussion leading and class participation\n\nExpectations\n\nThe class will be at least partly what you make it--lively and informative if you are prepared, something less appealing if you are not. You are expected to complete the reading, diligently attend class, be an active, engaged participant as a discussion leader and contributor, and submit clearly written and argued papers.\n\nParticipation\n\nYou each will direct two class discussions: one in the first half of the term and the other in the second half. Your job is to pose good questions to the class and generate discussion about the readings and related questions, and to get us to focus on issues that interest you. (For example, you can make connections between the readings that focus on historical developments, and relevant aspects of sound, music, and media now.) For these classes you should prepare a 1-page agenda outlining questions, themes, passages, and so on for the rest of us to consider. I urge you to communicate with me beforehand (over e-mail) to discuss the topics and strategies you have in mind. We will determine the schedule for discussion leading early in the term.\n\nAttendance\n\nAs the above implies, regular attendance is crucial for good work in this course, including being on time to class meetings, and attendance at possible film screenings (to be arranged, depending on scheduling and enrollment). However, I realize emergencies do arise during the semester. For those, you are permitted two unexcused absences. Please notify me ahead of time if you need to miss a class. Any unexcused absence beyond the second will result in a failing grade in the course. Two latenesses count as one absence.\n\nReading\n\nBecause it can be difficult to describe and analyze such an abstract concept as sound, some of the reading for this class will be more philosophical and/or challenging in argument, content, or style than you may be used to, though potentially more rewarding as well. I have tried to balance some of this more demanding reading with more accessible texts. Please be aware that none of the reading is optional.\n\nWriting\n\nYou will be required to submit three 6-page papers + one revision. The revision can be either of the first or second paper. Late paper policy is as follows: An extension on a paper will require prior approval and will be granted at my discretion, and only in extraordinary circumstances. Late papers without approved extensions will be given no credit.\n\nGrading\n\nACTIVITIES\n\nPERCENTAGES\n\nPapers (3 + 1 revision)\n\n40%\n\nDiscussion directing\n\n30%\n\nParticipation\n\n30%\n\nSchedule\n\nSES #\n\nTOPICS\n\nKEY DATES\n\n1-3\n\nHearing and Listening in Modernity\n\n4-6\n\nSoundscapes: Prehistorical, Architectural, Urban, and Industrial\n\n7-10\n\nAural Media Communities I: Stethoscope through Phonograph\n\nSession 9: First paper due\n\n11-12\n\nSpeech, Sound Media, and the Talkies\n\n13-17\n\nAural Media Communities II: Telephone, Radio, and Tape\n\nSession 14: Guest Lecture with Prof. A.

It is from the marked ab\nsence of any expression of ideas in most\nmodern works of art that our picture ex\nhibitions are such barren and desolate\nwastes of colored canvases.\nWith all\nthe monotony of subject found in a col\nlection of old masters, with the endless\nsuccession of holy families and saints and\nmartyrs, there is enough earnestness of\npurpose and sincerity of expression to\ngive to these worn-out stories a kind of\nhuman interest which rarely flags, even\nthough the eye be wearied by the repe\ntition of compositions on ~he same theme.\nIn the present stage of art there is a\nreaction against the idealism of the past,\nand the demand is for execution; for a\ndegree of technical skill which few of\nthe old masters attained, and which for\nthe last two centuries has never been\nequaled. The natural result of this re\naction is a poverty of ideas in painting;\nnot that th(3re are fewer subjects at the\ncommand of the artist than in the days\nwhen the Bible was his sole inspiration,\nbut because he is preoccupied with the\nuse of his material, and finds that after\nhe has gained satisfactory skill both the\ndemands of the public and his own ac\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n&060HGLDDQG0HWKRGV6RXQG\n)DOO\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

100\nwrords might\nbe put upon\na single\nsheet economically.\nStill,\nit is\nproblematical\nwhether\na less number\nof grooves\nper inch might\nnot be the better\nplan?it\ncertainly\nwould\nfor

will\nexperiment\nwith\na view\nof ascertaining\nthe best mean\ncapacity.\nThe\npractical\napplication\nof\nthis\nform\nof phonograph\nfor\ncommunications\nis very\nsimple.\nA\nsheet of foil\nis

written\nout, they are required\nto do no more* by the phono\ngraphic method,\nand do thereby dispense with\nthe clerk, and main\ntain perfect\nprivacy\nin their communications.\nThe\nphonograph\nletters may\nbe dictated\nat home,\nor in the\noffice\nof a friend,\nthe presence\nof a stenographer\nnot\nbeing re\nquired.\nThe\ndictation\nmay\nbe as rapid\nas the\nthoughts\ncan be\nformed,\nor the\nlips utter\nthem.\nThe\nrecipient\nmay\nlisten\nto his\nletters being\nread at a rate of from 150 to 200 words\nper minute,\nand at the\nsame time busy

become\nuni\nversally\nadopted,\na correspondent\nin Hong-Kong\nmay\npossibly\nnot be\nsupplied with\nan apparatus,\nthus necessitating\na written\nletter of the old-fashioned\nsort.\nIn that case the writer would\nuse\nhis phonograph\nsimply\nas a dictating-machine,\nhis clerk writing\nit out from the phonograph\nat leisure,\ncausing\nas many\nwords\nto\nbe uttered\nat one\ntime as his memory\nwas\ncapable\nof retaining\nuntil\nhe had written\nthem down.\nThis\nclerk need\nnot be a ste\nnographer,\nnor need he have been present when\nthe letter was
