      "content": "Systems Microbiology 1.084J/20.106J PROBLEM SET #1 - Solutions\n\nProblem 1\na.\nDescribe the different sorts of evidence for life's appearance on the early Earth ~ 3.5 bya.\nThe evidence for this phenomenon is isotopic record, rocks and microfossils, organic geochemical\nrecords, and molecular evolution.Microfossils exist that look as though they could be from\ncyanobacteria. Stromatolites have been formed from cyanobacteria and other algae binding sediment\ntogether forming 'bio-layers'. Carbon isotope signatures from 3.4 billion year old mat-like structures\nsuggest carbon dioxide fixation. The presence of stable carbon and oxygen isotopes also suggest\nbacteria were producing large quantities well before other oxygen-consuming organism were present.\nMolecular signatures, such as steranes and 2-methyl hopanes, only known to be produced by\neukaryotes and cyanobacteria, respectively, have been isolated from extremely old rock. The presence\nof iron beds is another clue to the presence of bacteria changing the atmosphere over from mainly\ncarbon dioxide to more nitrogen and oxygen.\nb. Which evidence seems most compelling to you, and why?\nAnswers will vary.\nc.\nWhat dramatic change ~ 2.5 billion years ago has influenced biology on Earth ever since, and how\ndid it happen?\nGreat Oxidation event. Bacteria evolved that were capable of producing oxygen via photosynthesis,\ncyanobacteria. They pumped (and continue to pump) large amounts of oxygen into the atmosphere.\n\nProblem 2\na. Describe how you might determine the stable isotope compositions of different compounds in\ninorganic, as well as organic or living materials.\nIsotope ratio description: compare ratios of heavy and light isotopes of compounds.\nb. What elements might be useful for investigating biological processes using stable isotope ratios?\n\nHydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur.\nc. Describe in detail the metric that's used to differentiate stable isotope content of a specific element\nin different compounds.\nIsotope ratios, R. R = heavy isotope/light isotope. Mass spectrometry is used to compare the isotopic\nration of a sample to a known standard:\nQuickTimeTM and a\nTIFF (LZW) decompressor\nare needed to see this picture.\n\nProblem 3\na.\nDraw the general structure of gram negative and gram positive bacterial cell walls.\nb. What gives these cell walls their structural integrity, how, and why is that important.\nStructural integrity of bacterial cell walls is provided by peptidoglycan crosslinking, which is important for\nstability and flexibility of the cell to withstand stress/force.\nc.\nWhat are the major differences, and their biological implications?\nGram-positive: no outer-membrane thus cell wall consists of only wall-anchored proteins, teichoic acids\n& lipoteichoic acid in the peptidoglycan layer.\nGram-negative: outer-membrane + peptidogylcan layer (periplasm); the outer-membrane consists of\nlipopolysaccharide, porins, lipoproteins, and phospholipids.\nBiological implications: (reasonable answers accepted) The outer-membrane of gram-negative\norganisms allows space for many enzymes to reside outside the cell membrane such as chemo\nreceptors and transporters, as well as porins on through the outer-membrane. At the same time,\nendotoxins due to lipid A of LPS are present in gram-negative organisms.\n\nProblem 4\na.\nDescribe the various functions of the cell membrane in bacteria.\nThe cytoplasmic membrane is important for anchoring proteins, acting as a permeability barrier, and for\nenergy conservation.\nb. Name three different classes of transport systems.\nUniporters, symporters, and antiporters\nc.\nDescribe the three different functional types of transport systems, and their general similarities and\ndifferences.\nSimple transporters: involve only a membrane-spanning component (ie Lac permease transporter)\nPhosphotransferase-type transporters: involve series of proteins that cooperate in the transport event\n(ie phosphotransferase system)\nABC systems: involve a membrane-spanning component, a periplasmic-binding component and ATP-\nhydrolyzing proteins (kinases).\n\nProblem 5\nThere exists a motile marine cyanobacterium that can swims at speeds of 80 um/sec, but no one has\never identified its flagella, despite repeated attempts. Its mode of motility still remains a mystery, but\nits Reynolds (R) number is not. Assuming a swimming speed of 80 um/sec, and a cell radius of 2000\nnm, calculate R for this bacterium. How does this compare to E. coli?\nR = a * ν * ρ / η = a * ν / υ ; where a is the length, υ is kinematic viscosity, ρ is fluid density, ν is\nvelocity, and η is fluid viscosity.\nR = 2000nm * 80,000nm/sec *1/1012nm2/sec = 1.6 x 10-4\nR is comparable to E. coli.\n\nProblem 6\na.\nDraw and describe the structural and functional components and properties of bacterial flagella,\nand their general mode of synthesis.\nFlagella are long, spiral-shaped rods anchored in the cytoplasmic membrane, and are attached to the\ncell surface by a complex of flagellar motor proteins, which include L & P rings anchoring the hook to\nthe outer membrane and peptidoglycan, Mot proteins,MS and C rings that surround the Fli proteins\n(motor switch) located in the cytoplasminc membrane There is a hook in the flagellum filament that\nadjoins the flagellum and flagellar motor. Flagellum is a multimer of the protein flagellin. Synthesis\nbegins with the motor proteins, then the hook ending with flagellin monomers to grow the flagellum.\nb. If you were to follow the synthesis of flagella with a \"pulse chase\" experiment, by adding first\nunlabelled amino acids followed by radio-labeled amino acids, what pattern of labeling during\nflagellar biosynthesis would you expect to see? (A, B, or C) A, flagellin monomers added to tip,\nnot base."

      "content": "Systems Microbiology 1.084J/20.106J PROBLEM SET #2 - Due Monday Oct. 2nd\n\nProblem 2.1\na.\nWhat does proton motive force mean, and why is it important in biology? (Ch.5 Review Question [RQ] 14)\nThe porton motive force is an \"energized\" state of a membrane created by the expulsion of protons to\nthe exterior face of the membrane creating a \"charge separation\" similar to a battery. The dissipation\nof this charge gradient through a membrane-bound ATPase complex provides energy for ATP\nsynthesis.\nb. How is rotational energy in the ATPase used to produce ATP? (Ch.5 RQ 15)\nRotational energy in ATPase is used to produce ATP via proton motive forse coupled to\nconformational changes in subunits of ATPase holoenzyme. Movement of protons through the Fo\nsubunit drives rotation of the c proteins generating torque. Conformational changes in the β-subuint\ntransfers this potential energy to the F1 subunit.\n\nProblem 2.2\na.\nWhat are the differences in electron donor and carbon source used by Esherichia coli and Acidithiobacillus\nthioparus (a sulfur chemolithotroph)? (Ch.5 RQ 19)\nElectron transport chains with oxygen as the final electron acceptor are utilized by both organisms.\nE. coli oxidizes organic compounds to produce energy, whereas A. thioparus oxidizes inorganic sulfur\nto use it as an electron donor.\nb. The following is a series of coupled electron donors and electron acceptors. Using Figure 5.9, order this\nseries from most energy-yielding to least energy-yielding. (Ch.5 RQ 9)\n\nH2/Fe3+\nH2S/O2\nCH3OH/NO3-\n\nH2/O2\n\nFe2+/O2\nNO2-/Fe3+\nH2S/NO3-\n\nH2/O2, H2/Fe3+, H2S/O2, CH3OH/NO3-, H2S/NO3-, NO2-/Fe3+, Fe2+/O2\nc.\nExplain the circumstances under which the same substance can be either an electron donor or an electron\nacceptor.\nThe coupler pairing determines acceptor versus donor. The substance with a more positive Eo' is the\ne- donor and the more negative Eo' is the e- acceptor. Thus, depending on the available copule for\nreduction or oxidation, and the relative concentrations of each species (both e- donor and acceptor) a\nsubstance will act as an e- acceptor or donor.\nd. Consider the following reaction:\nNADH + fumarate ⇒ succinate + NAD+ + H+\na.\nUsing Table 1 calculate the ΔE0' of the reaction. What is the ΔG0'? Does this reaction produce or\nconsume energy?\nΔE0' = [Eo\n'(acceptor) - Eo\n'(donor)] = [+30mV/mol e- - (-320mV/mol e-)] = +350mV\nΔG = -nFΔE; n = 2 mol e- ; F = 96.5kJ/V*mol\nΔG = -67.5kJ\nb. Does this look to you like a potential reaction in a respiratory pathway? Why, or why not?\nAnswers will vary.\n\nProblem 2.3\na.\nExplain the following observation: cells of E. coli fermenting glucose grow faster when NO3\n- is supplied to\nthe culture, and then grow even faster when the culture is highly aerated. (Ch.5 Application Question 4)\nWhen E. coli is growing in a fermentative mode, there is no external electron receptor and the energy\nyield is low. When NO3\n- is added to the culture, nitrate acts as an electron receptor. Under these\nrespiratory conditions the energy yield is greater than fermentative conditions but still less than when\nO2 is the final electron receptor (aerobic).\nb. Discuss why energy yield in an organism undergoing anaerobic respiration is less than that of an organism\nundergoing aerobic respiration.\nAnswers will vary. Basically, O2 has a more positive Eo', therefore in coupled redox reactions more\nfree energy is available using O2 as the terminal electron acceptor.\n\nProblem 2.4\nExplain our current understanding of molecular adaptations to the cytoplasmic membrane that are present in\npsychrophiles and describe their habitat. How about thermophiles?\n\nTypically psychrophiles are found where the temperature is constantly cold opposed to seasonal\nwinters. Their cytoplasmic membranes contain higher concentrations of unsaturated fatty acids and\nsometimes polyunsaturated fatty acids that maintain a semifluid state at low temperatures. Enzymes\nof psychrophiles are cold-active with greater amounts of α-helices and fewer β-sheets as well as\ngreater numbers of polar amino acids. Thermophiles would be found in environments that are\nconsistently hot. Therefore, thermophiles have enzymes and other proteins that are more stable and\nfunction optimally at high temperatures. Cytoplasmic membranes of thermophiles also contain lipids\nrich in saturated fatty acids, which allow form stronger hydrophobic environments (more stable\nmembrane in heat).\n\nProblem 2.5\na.\nDescribe the growth cycle of a population of bacterial cells from the time this population is first inoculated\ninto fresh medium. (Ch.6 RQ 6)\nThe four stages are: lag, log (exponential), stationary, and death phases. Measurements of total\nversus viable cell counts will be identical during log phase growth. However, during stationary phase\nthe viable count may differ from total cell count since intact cells that are no longer viable will be\nincluded in the total cell count.\nb. Describe a direct and an indirect method to measure microbial growth. (Ch.6 RQ 7)\nDirect counts can be accomplished using a light microscope. Medium containing the cells is placed in\na counting chamber, which is a microscope slide containing etched lines forming a grid of known size.\nBecause the cover slip is a known distance above the slide, each grid contains a known voume of\nmedium. By counting the cells in several grids, the number of cells in the culture can be calculated.\nIndirect counts are based on turbidity of the medium (culture). The culture is placed in a\nspectrophotometer cell and the absorbance is measured. Under limited conditions (log growth), the\nnumber of cells present can be estimated fairly accurately using a standard curve generated by plate\ncounts at the time of absorbance readings.\nc.\nIf a 1-liter culture of rich medium is inoculated with 3 bacterial cells per milliliter, how many cells will be\nin the culture after 2 hours, given that there is an hour lag phase and the generation time is 20 minutes?\nAfter 3 hours? After 4 hours if one of the initial 3 cells was dead? Calculate k for the 3-hour time period\n(assuming all initial cells were alive).\nN = N02n ; n = t/g ; k = 0.301n/t ; N0 = 3 cells/ml\nn(2h) = 60min/20min = 3 N(2h) = 3*23 = 24 cells/ml\nn(3h) = 6 N(3h) = 3*26 = 192 cells/ml\nn(4h) = 9 N(3h) = (3-1)*29 = 1024 cells/ml\nk(3h) = 0.301*6/2h = 0.903 h-1\n\nProblem 2.6\nAs part of a UROP project, you get a chance to quantify bacterial numbers in environmental samples. The\ngraduate student you are working with has used centrifugation to concentrate 10 1-liter samples of oligotrophic\nlake water 1000-fold (i.e. in a final volume of 1 ml). She asks you to determine the number of viable bacteria in\nthe samples. By plating 10-fold serial dilutions on minimal media and incubating in ambient O2 at 37°C, you\nget small, slow-growing colonies:\n\nStarting dilution (1 ml)\nAmount spread on plate\nNumber of colonies\nConcentrated sample\n100 μl\nToo numerous to count\n10-1\n100 μl\n10-2\n100 μl\n10-3\n100 μl\nNone\n10-4\n100 μl\nNone\n10-5\n100 μl\nNone\n\nWhen you plate and incubate on rich media using the same conditions, you get no growth at all.\n\na.\nHow could you distinguish between the presence of a growth inhibitor in the rich media and fatal oxidative\nstress leading to a failure to form colonies on the rich media?\nAnswers will vary. Could try lower O2 concentrations.\n\nb. The graduate student asks if you made a mistake with you dilutions, because she counted an average of 105\nbacteria in the samples under the microscope. What might account for the discrepancy between your CFU\ncounts and her direct total counts?\nNon-viable cells are counted in total cell counts, but will not form CFUs.\nc.\nOne method for determining viability of bacteria employs direct microscopic visualization of cultures after\nincubation with nutrients in the presence of an antibiotic that inhibits DNA replication. Using this so called\ndirect viable count (DVC) elongated bacteria are considered viable. What advantage does the DVC method\nhave over CFU determination? Explain your reasoning.\nAnswers will vary.\n\nProblem 2.7\nFor methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins (MCP) that respond to chemoattractants, the \"ground state\" is high\nsensitivity, with decreaseing sensitivity as the organism traverses the gradient, and eventual re-set by\ndemethylation (presumabley when the desirable chemoattractant is depleted). Do you think an MCP involved\nexclusively in responding to noxious stimuli that an organism tries to avoid would work the same or differently?\nExplain your reasoning.\nMCPs responding to repellents work the opposite of those responding to attractants with regards to\nsensitivity and running with changes in stimulant (can be attractant or repellant) concentration. The\nproteins within the chemotaxis pathway all work the same. Repellent MCPs have highly methylated,\ninsensitive 'ground states'. Upon activation, they activate CheA, which is the opposite of attractant\nMCPs. This situation is similar to the 'no stimulant/no prey' situation discussed in class. CheA is\nphosphorylated leading to phosphorylation of CheY and CheB. The presence of phosphorylated\nCheY causes tumbling more often. Phosphorylated CheB de-methylates the MCP, increasing\nsensitivity to repellent (less repellent required for activation). In turn, if the concentration of repellent\ndecreases, the receptor is less 'active' causing less CheY phosphorylation leading to longer runs.\nThis would coincide with less phosphorylated CheB, more CheR, and re-setting of the sensitivity to\nthe 'ground state' of high methylation. The mechanisms of the pathways are the same, with the\nexception of the initial activation of the receptor. Upon stimulation with repellent, CheW inhibits CheA\ncausing less phosphorylation and more methylation, whereas a repellent activates CheA causing\nmore phosphorylation and de-methylation (less methylation)."

      "content": "Solutions Systems Microbiology 1.084J/20.106J PROBLEM SET #3\n\nProblem 3.1\na.\nDescribe the stringent response, and at what level and what components of cellular activity it regulates.\nThe stringent response is triggered in response to two modified nucleotides called alarmones--guanosine\ntetraphostpate (ppGpp) and guanosine pentaphosphate (pppGpp). These nucleotides accumulate rapidly during\na shift-down from amino acid excess to starvation and are synthesized by an STP-dependent protein, RelA that\nis associated with the ribosomal 50S subunit. These alarmones have global control effects that inhibit rRNA and\ntRNA synthesis, and thus adjust the cell's biosynthesis in response to amino acid limitation.\nb. Most biosynthetic operons need only be under negative control for effective regulation, while most\ncatabolic operons need to be under both negative and positive control. Why might this be?\nBiosynthetic operons normally require only negative control for effective regulation because the cell only needs\nto know when there is \"enough\" of that biosynthetic product for growth. Catabolic operons, on the other hand,\nhave to be regulated both positively and negatively, since these operons provide the ATP for biosynthesis, and\nalso the carbon intermediates for biosynthesis.\nc.\nWhy are promoters from E. coli under positive control not close matches to the promoter consensus\nsequence for E. coli?\nIf a promoter closely matches the DNA consensus sequence one would expect RNA polymerase to bind to that\npromoter and induce transcription in the absence of other factors. Therefore, promoters under positive control\nwould be expected to be quite different.\nd. The attenuation control of some of the pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway genes in E. coli actually involves\ncoupled transcription and translation. Can you propose a mechanism whereby the cell could somehow\nmake use of translation to help it measure the level of pyrimidine nucleotides?\nIf there were a shortage of pyrimidine nucleotides, one would expect transcription to go more slowly. Such a\nsystem might include a termination loop that forms unless the ribosome is closely following the RNA polymerase.\nWhen polymerase is functioning at maximal rates, it moves out ahead of the ribosome, allowing the termination\nloop to form. When transcription slows because of pyrimidine shortage, the ribosome follows RNA polymerase\nclosely enough so that the loop does not form.\ne. How could quorum sensing be considered a regulatory mechanism for conserving cell resources?\nQuorum sensing systems can be considered a regulatory mechanism for conserving cell resources is that the\ngenes under its control are all induced at the same times in response to cell density, and conditions that enhance\nproductive use of those resources. For example, pathogenesis in many Pseudomonas aerugenosa requires high\ncell densities for invasion and colonization, and also for production of biofilms that increase pathogenicity and\nprotect the cells from antibiotics.\n\nProblem 3.2\n\na.\nHow does homologous recombination differ from site-specific recombination?\nHomologous recombination refers to recombination involving extensive homology between two regions of DNA.\nIn site-specific recombination, a site on the DNA, usually a few base pairs in length, is recognized by a specific\nprotein and results in recombination between two DNA molecules that often do not share homology.\nb. What does an F+ cell need to do before it can transfer chromosomal genes?\nBefore a donor cell can transfer chromosomal genes it must initiate DNA replication and continue DNA synthesis\nduring transfer.\nc.\nWhat do you think are the most useful transposons for isolating a variety of bacterial mutants? Why are\nsuch transposons so useful for this purpose?\nTransposons containing antibiotic resistance genes are useful for obtaining a variety of mutants since the\nintroduction of the transposons into a population of cells allows the use of antibiotic selection to identify viable\ncells containing the transposon while counter selecting against those cells not stably integrating the transposon.\nd. Describe why the discovery and use of transformation and the use of the F plasmid were important\nmilestones in the history of genetics. What insights did they contribute?\nTransformation experiments lead to proof that DNA was the genetic material. F plasmids allow for chromosomal\nmapping.\ne.\nDescribe three different ways that foreign DNA can enter the cell. How can homologous recombination\nfavor the integration of more than a single or a few genes into the chromosome?\nConjugation--Direct cell-to-cell transfer of plasmid DNA through pili or channels between bacteria.\nTransduction--Transfer of DNA mediated by independently replicating bacterial viruses (bacteriophages).\nBacteriophages have variations in specificity, but typically DNA transferred via transduction is among closely\nrelated bacteria.\nTransformation--Uptake of naked DNA from the environment either naturally (via transport proteins) or artificially\n(electroporation, or other methods of making holes in cell walls).\n\nHomologous recombination requires sequence homology, thus with prokaryotes this is likely to be triggered by\nmultiple genes.\n\nProblem 3.3\na.\nExplain why in generalized transduction one always refers to a transducing particle but in specialized\ntransduction one refers to a transducing virus or phage.\nGeneralized transduction refers to the \"accidental\", random incorporation of host DNA into the virus particle.\nThus, in a given population of phage particles, only a few will contain host DNA. For this reason, the particles\nare called transducing particles. Specialized transduction involves a mutant phage that has lost some of its\noriginal DNA and has picked up a specific fragment of host genetic material. In a suspension of a specialized\ntransducing phage, essentially all of the virus particles will contain the transduced gene.\nb. What are the essential characteristics of a cloning vector? What characteristics of plasmids make them\nespecially useful as vectors for molecular cloning? What characteristic(s) of the F plasmid makes it less\nuseful for use in vitro?\nThe essential characteristics of a cloning vector are 1) small size making DNA isolation and manipulation easier,\n2) independent origin of replication, 3) multiple copy number allowing for amplification of cloned DNA, and 4)\nselectable markers for identification of the cells containing the cloning vector or recombinant clone.\nCharacteristics that make plasmids especially useful for molecular cloning (including those just stated) include 1)\na polylinker, or multiple cloning site, 2) color selection for immediate identification of recombinant plasmids, and\n3) promoters for expression of the cloned gene. (e.g. M13 phage promoters for generation of single-stranded\nDNA, etc). The F plasmid is much too large to be useful as a cloning vector and does not contain any selectable\nmarkers.\nc.\nWhat are the general properties of insertion elements? Class II transposons?\nInsertion elements (or sequences) have no genes other than hose required for them to move to a new location.\nThey are ~1000bp in length and become interated at specific sites on the genome (both plasmids and\nchromosomal DNA, and a few bacteriophages). Homologous recombination often occurs between IS elements\ncausing the integration of new DNA. Transposons are larger than IS elements and contain other genes such as\nantibiotic resistance. Conjugative transposons are able to move between bacterial species via conjugation, not\nsolely around in one genome.\n\nProblem 3.4\nFive Hfr strains A through E are derived from a single F+ strain of E. coli. The following table shows the time of\nentry (in minutes) of the first 5 genetic markers observed in interrupted mating experiments.

      "content": "Solutions Systems Microbiology 1.084J/20.106J PROBLEM SET #4\n\nProblem 4.1\na.\nDescribe the process of \"shotgun sequencing\". Assuming an average read length of 1 kbp per individual\nsequence, approximately how many clones would you need to sequence to close a 10 Mbp genome?\nShotgun sequencing relies on efficient and random cloning of the DNA of interest, and the generation of large\nnumbers of clones so that the sequences can be computer assembled by looking for enough overlapping DNA\nfragments to cover the entire genome.\nb. Describe the other main alternative method for determining whole genome sequences. Are these two\nmethods mutually exclusive?\nBAC sequencing utilizes larger insert clones. The BAC library is made, ordered maps of large clone contigs are\nmade, then the BAC to be sequenced is done by shotgun sequencing followed by assembly.\n\nProblem 4.2\nWhen the yeast nuclear genome was published the entire sequence was not completed. Additionally, the yeast\nmitochondrial genome proved difficult to accurately sequence. Describe in both cases the practical difficulties\nthat were encountered during sequencing.\nThe major difficulty in obtaining the complete sequence of the yeast nuclear genome was due to the extremely\nlong runs of repetitive DNA and it is very difficult to accurately sequence these regions. With regard to the\nmitochondrial genome, there is such diversity in types that it is difficult to know \"what to expect\" in terms of size,\ncodon usage, organization, etc. S. cerevisiae's in vivo genome may be linear, further complicating the process.\n\nProblem 4.3\na.\nCompare and contrast BACs with YACs - how are they employed in genome sequencing projects?\nBAC (bacterial artificial chromosomes) can carry >300 kb of foreign DNA and are derived from a \"trimmed down\"\nversion of E. coli's F' plasmid. YACs are similar in their ability to carry large fragments of DNA (200-800kb),\nexcept that they have been designed to replicate in yeasts (contain a yeast origin of replication) and contain\ntelomeres (for replication of linear chromosomes) and centromeres (for segregation during mitosis). Both BACs\nand YACs are used for DNA cloning & genome sequencing.\nb. What does annotating a genome mean, how is this accomplished, and how does it differ from assembling a\ngenome?\nGenome annotation is the conversion of raw seque3nce data into a list of genes, promoter elements, and\nregulatory sequences present in the organism. Gene assembly is the ordering of the DNA fragments and\neliminating overlaps in the sequence but is not involved in \"making sense\" of the sequence data.\nc.\nExplain how horizontally transferred genes can be detected in a genome.\nComparative genomics detects horizontally transferred genes. The presence of genes found only in distantly\nrelated species are often horizontally transferred genes. Differences in ORF GC content or codon biases from\nthe rest of the genome indicated transferred genes. Functions of genes are also a clue, as horizontally\ntransferred genes are typically not related to transcription, translation or replication.\nd. As a proportion of the total genome, what functional class of genes predominates in small genome\norganisms versus larger ones--why is this?\nThe percentage of genes involved in protein synthesis is much higher in organisms with small genomes\ncompared to those with larger genomes. In larger genomes, transcription and two-component signal\ntransduction genes are much higher than in smaller genomes. These biases are because the protein\nsynthesizing apparatus cannot be dispensed, whereas regulatory proteins are not essential and are often\nspecialized thus only exist in larger genomes. The smaller the genome, the larger fraction will be protein\nsynthesis genes.\n\nProblem 4.4\na.\nIn Bacteria and Archaea the acronym ORF is almost synonomous with \"gene\", which is not the case in\neukaryotes. Explain. What are the practical implications of this difference, with respect to the relative ease\nof sequencing bacterial versus eukaryotic genomes?\nThe acronym ORF is used synonymously with the term \"gene\" in Archaea and Bacteria since it decribes the\nsequence of nucleotides that when transcribed can immediately be translated into a protein. This is not the case\nin higher eukaryotes, which posess introns, an thus the functional gene is interrupted, and does not directly\nencode the corresponding protein.\nb. The gene encoding the β-subunit of RNA polymerase from E. coli is said to be orthologous to the rpoB\ngene of Bacillus subtilis. What does that mean about the relationship between the two genes? What protein\ndo you think rpoB of B. subtilis encodes? Many genes for different sigma factors of E. coli are paralogous.\nWhat does this imply about their relationship?\n\nThe term orthologue refers to a gene found in one organism that is similar to a gene found in another and\ndifferent species. The similarity between an RNA polymerase subunit gene in E. coli and the rpoB gene in B.\nsubtilis suggests that these genes may have arisen by horizontal gene transfer. Based upon the sequence\nsimilarity, one may be able to hypothesize that the rpoB gene encodes a protein that is also involved in\ntranscription, perhaps serving the similar function in the RNA polymerase holoenzyme as the orthologous gene\nin E. coli. The paralogous genes encoding the different E. coli sigma factors suggests that they arose by gene\nduplication at some time during the organism's evolution.\n\nProblem 4.5\nThe massive amounts of genome sequence data that are now accumulating provide a starting point for\nunderstanding the relationship between the entire coding potential of a microorganisms, and how it might\nfunction and respond under different environmental conditions. In one sense however, the genome sequence\nsimply the \"parts list\" of an organism's genes. Describe the tools and approaches, and give an example\nexperiment that you might use to leverage the entire genome sequence of E. coli to describe its gene expression\nand protein complement under different environmental conditions.\nAnswers will vary but should include a microarray or proteomics experiment with E.coli under different\nenvironmental conditions, as well as gene knockouts of E. coli under these same conditions.\n\nProblem 4.6\nGenome structure and evolution can best be understood in the context of the life history, physiology, and\nactivities of the organisms that encode them. A good example of this comes from recent studies of aphid\nendosymbionts, their relationship to their insect host, and the subsequent trajectory of their genome evolution.\nBriefly describe this host-symbiont system, the interactions of the two partners (Buchnera aphidicola and\naphids), and the consequences of this natural history for their genome structure and function."

Nonetheless, cell lines derived from different mammalian tissues range from\nhighly susceptible (cytotoxic dose 50+ [CD50] of approximately 10 pg/ml) to completely resistant (CD50 >\n1 μg/ml). What cellular or molecular differences do you think account for susceptibility and resistance of\nthese cell lines. How could you test your hypothesis?\n\n*LD50 is the dose at which 50% of the test subjects die. In this case, it was determined for rabbits given\nintravenous injections of the toxin.\n+CD50 is the concentration at which 50% of the cells die.\nDifferent cell lines from different tissues will or will not express the receptor for the B subunit of the toxin.\nWithout receptor expression the A subunit of the toxin will not get transported into the cytoplasm where it will\nbe able to inhibit protein synthesis. This can be tested by administering the B subunit alone or the A subunit\nalone to determine the susceptibility of each cell line. Could also test for Gb3 content of the cells.\n\nProblem 6.2\na.\nList and describe the important steps in selection and activation of a T-cell. Why are each of these\nsteps important and what would be the consequences if they did not occur?\nPositive selection--T cells that DO interact with MHC proteins in the thymus divide and proliferate. Cells\nthat DO NOT interact (bind) MHC die off. Important to ensure the TCRs will recognize the MHC, if they\ndidn't the cells would not be activated and would die.\nNegative selection--T cells that DO interact with self antigen and MHC in the thymus are killed. Cells that\nDO NOT continue to proliferate. Important to limit self-reactive T cells in the periphery that would cause\nmassive autoimmune reactions.\nActivation in periphery--T cells that bind antigen-MHC complex and get second signal (CD28 binds to B7.1\nor B7.2) become activated, proliferating and secreting cytokines as their specific effector functions dictate\n(depends on type of T cell).\nb. Specificity and tolerance are necessary for the adaptive immune response. What role does immune\nmemory play? How does production and maintenance of memory cells benefit the host?\nMemory allows the immune system to recognize and respond more rapidly to a previously encountered\nantigen. Memory is valuable because it permits the system to more vigorously respond to subsequent\nencounters with the same antigen and thus more readily fend off an infectious disease or debilitating illness.\n\nProblem 6.3\na.\nConstruct a table that lists the common features of proteins encoded by members of the Ig gene\nsuperfamily.

These constant domains have homologous amino acid sequences and higher-order\nstructure, whereas the variable domains present in immunoglobulins and TCRs, as well as the antigen\nbinding domain MHC class I and MHC class II are not conserved\nb. Describe the structural and functional differences among the five major antibody classes.\nIgM-m heavy chain, first Ig produced, mainly surface bound, secreted upon activation in pentameric form\n(early infection)\nIgD-d heavy chain, same antigen binding site as IgM, surface bound, abundant on memory B-cells\nIgG-g heavy chain, many isotypes, monomer, major class in blood, Fc regions bind Fc receptors on\nmacrophages and neutrophils, only Ig able to breach placental barrier (Fc regions)\nIgE-e heavy chain, monomer, very high affinity (KA~1010L/mole) Fc receptor on mast cells (tissue) and\nbasophils (blood), also binds Fc receptors on eosinophils\nIgA/sIgA-a heavy chain, main Ig in secretory fluids, monomer in blood and dimer in secretions, produced in\nmucosal-associated lymphoid tissue\nc.\nWhich class of antibody is the most prevalent? Why do you think this is/what advantage does this\nprovide the host?\nSecretory IgA is the most prevalent immunoglobulin. It's secretion to mucosal surfaces provides a line of\ndefense against pathogens, toxins, and other foreign antigens that could potential harm epithelial cells or\ncross over the epithelial barrier to reach other organs.\n\nProblem 6.4\nThe following description is for MacConkey sorbital (SMAC) agar:\n\nMode of Action\nBile salts mixture and crystal violet largely inhibit the growth of the Gram-positive microbial flora.\nSorbitol, together with the pH indicator neutral red, is used to detect sorbitol-positive colonies and\nturning them red in color. Sorbitol-negative strains, on the other hand, form colorless colonies.\n\nIs this a selective or a differential medium? Most commensal E. coli strains ferment sorbitol, while\npathogenic O157:H7 enterohemmorhagic E. coli (EHEC) do not. What color do you expect each of these\ncolonies to be on SMAC plates?\nSMAC plates are selective for gram negative bacteria and differential for EHEC strains (strains that do not\nferment sorbitol). EHEC would be clear colonies, and commensal E. coli would be pinkish colonies.\n\nProblem 6.5\nMany infectious diseases have no effective vaccines. Choose three pathogens/diseases and explain why\ncurrent vaccine strategies have not been effective. For each, describe an alternative immunization strategy.\n\nAnswers will vary.\n\nProblem 6.6\nWhat is the advantage of \"humanizing\" monoclonal antibodies for use as therapeutics? Explain how this\nmodification makes the recombinant molecule more safe and/or effective than a native mouse monoclonal\nthat has the same specificity.\nHumanized antibodies have the advantage that they will not be perceived as foreign to the human host.\nAntibodies from other hosts are typically recognized as foreign within a few weeks of treatment, thus the\ntherapy only works for a limited time. Most therapeutic uses of antibodies are for extended periods of time,\nnot only a few weeks, thus a treatment would need to be found after they non-humanized antibodies are\nrecognized as foreign."

Describe how\nbacteria find areas of higher nutrient concentration (or less 'repellant' ).\nDescribe the bacterial cell components involved in chemotactic signaling,\nand the overall mechanism.\n\n4. Derek Lovley and colleagues recently discovered anaerobic microbes that can\ntransfer the electrons from acetate oxidation directly to a graphite electrode, and\nfinally to oxygen, according to the scheme shown in the cartoon below:\n\na. Calculate the ΔEo' and ΔGo' for the oxidation of acetate (C H3COO-) through the\ntransfer to the electrode and finally to oxygen (assume there is no energy loss in\nthe transfer through the electrode to O2.). (Faraday constant, F = 96.5 kJ/Vmol)\n\nb. Calculate ΔEo' and ΔGo' for the oxidation of acetate (C H3COO-), when it is\ncoupled to the reduction of sulfate (SO4\n2-) to sulfide (HS-).\n\nc. Assuming there is only a 5 % efficiency of electron transfer through the graphite\nelectrode, what process yields more energy: Acetate oxidation coupled to sulfate\nreduction, or electron flow from acetate, through the graphite electrode to\noxygen, as shown above ?\n\nTable of standard reduction potentials Eo\n\nEo' [Volts]\nCH4 + 2 H2O\n→\nCO2 + 8 H+ + 8 e-\n- 0.24\nC H3COO- + 2H2O\n→\nCO2 + 7H+ + 8e-\n- 0.29\nCO + H2O\n→\nCO2 + 2H+ + 2e-\n- 0.49\nHS-\n→\nSo + H+ + 2e-\n- 0.28\nHS- + 4 H2O\n→ SO4\n2- + 9H+ + 8e-\n- 0.22\nHS- + 3 H2O\n→ SO3\n2- + 7H+ + 6e-\n- 0.22\nHS- + 3 H2O\n→ SO3 + 9H+ + 8e-\n- 0.12\n2 H2O\n→ O2 + 4H+ + 4e-\n\n+ 0.82"

Lateral gene transfer (LGT) can be divided in four main steps: release of genetic\ninformation from a donor, targeting of genetic information to a recipient, uptake, and\nsuccessful incorporation of the genetic information by the recipient. The last step,\nsuccessful incorporation, can involve homologous recombination, non-homologous\n(illegitimate) recombination, or episomal replication of the transferred genetic\ninformation. Give a specific example of LGT for each of these 3 types of successful\nincorporation of the genetic information by the recipient.\n\n2. Primary endosymbionts of aphid insects, including Buchnera species, are characterized\nby severe genome reduction, with genome sizes range from 450 to approximately 800 kb\ncompared to 5 to 6 Mb for Escherichia coli genomes. (A) Which features of\nendosymbiont biology account for this marked genome reduction? Explain your\nreasoning. (B) Describe an evolutionary model that explains why Buchnera of different\naphid lineages differ in genome size and gene content.\n\n3. The nitrogen cycle involves the interactions of many microbial species with one another,\nand other organisms, sometimes symbiotically. Several key processes in the oxidative-\nreductive cycling of nitrogen that only prokaryotes can catalyze.\n\na. Define and describe the importance of the following processes in nitrogen\ncycling (OK to sketch out the reactions):\n\ni.\nDenitrification\nii. Nitrification\niii. Nitrogen Fixation\n\nb.

Æ ecology, health, engineering...\n\n- Slide of biological levels from cell to ecosphere:\no With microbes, we can skip the levels of tissue, organ, etc., all the way up\nto the levels of population and community Æ a whole chain of\nmicroorganisms are involved\n\n- Slide of satellite shots of Earth showing chlorophyll from outer space:\no You can see blooms of microorganisms Æ the movement of El Nino over\nthe Pacific is visible via the changing growth of microbes.\no Earth looks really different from outer space because of microbes.\n\n- Microorganisms have been on Earth for about 3.8 billion years\no That's the majority of Earth's existence as a planet.\no Microbes can grow anywhere on Earth, in an astounding variety of\nconditions.\n\n- Metabolic diversity\no Microbes can eat and breathe just about anything - sulfates, nitrates,\nmetals... (they can even eat rocks!).\no From all this, they create biomass, which feeds the entire food chain.\n\n- All of this is essential in terms of energy and the environment.\n\no The vast amount of diversity on Earth exists in the microbial world.\no Microbes represent more than 50% of biomass in the oceans.\no They control all the elemental cycles that shape Earth's habitability.\no They can live without us... but we can't live without them.\no It used to be that microbes were the only way that nitrogen got into the\natmosphere...\nBut now, with fertilizers etc., people are contributing to the\nnitrogen cycle more than microbes are.\no Slide: photosynthesis and respiration\nPlants AÆ Animals: both are codependent\no Slide: Energy: The Anthropocentric perspective\nWe're using up all the oil, putting carbon dioxide in the\natmosphere.\no Slide: graph of atmospheric carbon dioxide over time, as measured at\nMauna Loa.\nShows a steep, steady increase - we haven't seen an increase like\nthis in a very long time - it doesn't look natural.\nThere are spikes of carbon dioxide every winter and lower areas\nevery summer, because plants are photosynthesizing more in the\nsummer.\nThis increase in carbon dioxide could have serious consequences\nas the greenhouse gas effect.\n\n- Slide: \"The Popular View of 'Bugs'\"\no People popularly think that microbes (\"bugs\") are somehow dirty or\ndamaging, but the truth is that you cannot get rid of them - they're all over\nyour body, and most of them are good for you.\nIt's a symbiotic relationship.\nSlide: host bacterial symbiosis in the human intestine.\n\n- Fundamentally, pathogenic microorganisms use the same machinery as\nnonpathogenic ones.\no Short movie: bacteriophage infecting a cell.\n\n- Biotechnology and biological engineering: research examples\no Functional diversity in rhodopsin - in the presence of light, this will move\na proton, creating an electrical gradient that allows ATP production\no The functional parts of a cell: people are working on creating a registry of\nstandard biological parts.\n\n- Life on Earth: How did we (everything) get here? (Lessons in geobiological\nengineering).\no Microbes seem to have originated about 3.8 billion years ago.\no But it turns out that the oldest rocks on Earth are only about 4 billion years\nold (existing in Greenland, Australia, and South Africa).\no Slide: \"The Early Earth System,\" \"The Evidence\"\n\no It's hard to make all these inferences, because the earth looks so different\nnow\nThe early earth had no oxygen, water only as steam, and lots of\nasteroid collisions.\no The origin of life on Earth:\nIn situ (originating here) or panspermia (coming from elsewhere\nvia a collision)\n- Panspermia seems unlikely, though interesting, because\nouter space can destroy these organic molecules very\nquickly.\nThe Oparin ocean scenario, or hydrothermal vents?\no Determining the atmospheric composition of the early earth is still largely\nguesswork\nThis early atmosphere had mildly reducing conditions\nAs the earth cooled, H20 dropped from the sky, and the oceans\nformed. These early oceans contained lots of sulfates and acids.\n\n- Some scenarios for the origin of life:\no The Miller Urey experiment: CH4, H2, NH4, and H2O, plus energy, will\ngenerate amino acids and simple sugars.\no But how do you produce molecules that actually replicate?\nSlide: ribosomal RNA - its folding, tertiary structure allows it to\nact as an enzyme: ribozyme.\nThus we have a single molecule that can reproduce itself and act as\nan enzyme, and hence this might be where life originated\nThere's also a clay that can create lipids, and once one of these\nribozymes ended up inside one of these lipid vesicles, very\ninteresting things could happen.\nHowever, there are some problems - we don't really know - this is\nall speculative.\n\n- The evidence for theories on the origin of life:\no People look at very old rocks, and identify impressions that look like life,\nstarting around 3.5 billion years back.\nMicrobes create macrofossils - stromatolites - microbial mats that\ncreate layers, building formations that look like big rock\nmushroom structures.\n\n- Stable isotope analysis, organic geochemistry.\no Look at the internal structure of an atom - there are different isotopes.\no We know the normal stable isotope abundances.\no Life changes these isotope abundances, because it uses light isotopes\npreferentially.\no The delta value δ - comparing isotope ratios - measure using mass\nspectroscopy.\n\n⎟⎟\n⎠\n⎞\n⎜⎜\n⎝\n⎛\n-\n=\nstd\nStd\nX\nX\nR\nR\nR\nδ\n\n(per mil)\no We breathe out more heavy oxygen than we take in\no In plants, they preferentially incorporate the lighter carbon dioxide as well\no All of this matters because we can measure the isotope ratios in fossils -\nold rocks - and they're really light!\nThis kind of chemical evidence is a lot more reliable than just\nexamining these rocks visually - this is real evidence.\n\n- Around 2.5 billion years ago something big happened, dropping huge amounts of\noxidized iron - rust - into the earth in huge red bands Æ this represents the rise of\noxygen in the atmosphere, as microbes and plants figured out how to split water.\no That rise in oxygen is what set the stage for us - animals."

Energy, Couscku)\n\n3⁄4 Problem Set #1 due next week\n\n3⁄4 Reading for today: Purcell, Berg, and Pace\n\n- Related to the last lecture:\no Life's history on Earth - Evidence\nPhylogenetic tree\nThe same machinery for making proteins - with ribosomes - is\nused all over Earth.\nYou can map how different the ribosomal RNA is in each species\non Earth.\n- In this way we can compare microbes to eukaryotes.\nA lot of the Eukarya tree (our own tree) is dominated by microbes\n- Archaea.\nChloroplast RNA falls right next to cyanobacteria on that tree\n- This supports the endosymbiont hypothesis - chloroplasts\nderive from cyanobacteria.\nSimilarly, mitochondrial RNA falls by agrobacteria - α\nproteobacteria.\no Life on Earth today: the foundation\nCO2/O2 cycle\n\n- To be covered today: Structure, Function, Motility\no The nature of being small\no Cell membranes and cell walls\no Flagella\n\n- Shape and Appearance - not where the interesting stuff is regarding microbes\no They don't bring in solid food - they bring in dissolved substrates.\nSurface area to volume:\nr\nr\nr\nV\nSA\n=\n=\nπ\nπ\n\no \"Prokaryote\" vs. Eukaryote\nIn eukaryotes, there are organelles and a nucleus - quite a lot of\ncommunication and transport is going on.\nIn prokaryotes, transcription and translation all occur together in\nthe cytoplasm\n\nHowever, \"Prokaryote\" is in quotes because it is only a negative\ndefinition - they are defined only by the lack of a membrane-\nbound nucleus.\nOne group of microbes - Archaea - are a lot more like eukaryotes\nthan they are like bacteria.\n- Their informational machinery - RNA polymerase,\npromoters - are more similar to those of eukaryotes.\nHence there are Three large branches of life: Bacteria, Archaea,\nand Eukarya (the two-branch representation of life as prokaryote\nvs. eukaryote is less accurate).\n\n- Cell membranes: phospholipid bilayer\no Main permeability barrier\no Embedded integral membrane proteins - communication, transport\no Membrane structure\nBacteria, eukaryotes\nArchaea\no Archaea can still make lipid bilayers - though sometimes they hook them\ndirectly together, making a lipid monolayer.\nThis is much more structurally rigid.\nThis is never found in bacteria or eukaryotes.\no Membranes act as a protein anchor.\no Also energy conservation - protein motive force.\no Membrane permeability to various molecules:\nSimple transport: let a proton down the gradient in order to move\nthings.\nGroup translocation: chemical modification of transported\nsubstance driven by phosphoenolpyruvate.\nABC system: periplasmic binding proteins are involved and energy\ncomes from ATP.\no Transport method:\nUniporter: one thing comes in.\nAntiporter: one thing in, one out.\nSymporter: two in at once.\no Gram-positive bacteria have one phospholipid bilayer.\nWith a thick peptidoglycan layer outside.\no Gram-negative bacteria have two bilayers\nThere is periplasm in between.\n- Most of the binding proteins are located here.\nThe outer membrane (lipopolysaccharide and protein)\n- Antibiotic resistance occurs here - resistance thus occurs\nmore easily in gram-negative bacteria.\nThere is a peptidoglycan layer in the middle of the periplasm, but\nit's very thin.\n- It forms a net-like structure, with a single molecule of\npeptidoglycan that acts as a nylon stocking.\n\n- This maintains structure, shape, and integrity.\n\nLipopolysaccharide chains outside - can often make people sick\no In penicillin, lysozyme chews up peptidoglycan\nThen water all rushes in, causing lysis\nPenicillin inhibits the crosslinks\nTherefore penicillin only works on cells that are growing\no Archea - S-layers, pseudo peptidoglycan\n\n- Motility\no Flagella - moves like a propeller in bacteria, not like a whip - they're\nrigid\nVideo clip: E. coli moving with rotating flagella\n\nη\nνρ\na\nForces\nViscous\nForces\nInertial\n≈\n\n← Fluid Density\n← Fluid Viscosity\nThe movement is dominated by viscosity\no Clamshell hypothesis: reciprocal motion doesn't work at low Reynolds\nnumber - instead it's a rotary motor\nProton motive force turns a ring that drives the motor\no Flagella are hollow on the inside\nMade of one protein: flagellin\nIt grows from the inside-out\nVery complex\no Going counter-clockwise they drive the cell forward\nGoing clockwise, they fly out in a tumble\no By changing the frequency, you get longer or shorter runs"

      "content": "20.106J - Systems Microbiology\nLecture 4\nProf. Schauer\n\n3⁄4 Reading for today: Chapter 6 - On Growth\n3⁄4 Problem set due today\n3⁄4 Today: Growth - in microorganisms it's different from in metazoans - increase in\nnumber of organisms instead of size\no Binary fission\no Other methods:\nOrganisms that replicate their DNA many times over, than split\ninto many parts at once\n3⁄4 Next week: metabolic regulation\n\nBinary Fission\no Time from bacterium to bacteria is a generation\no Generation time is how long it takes\no 20 minutes is a rather fast generation time. 8 minutes is the world record.\no We look for bacteria that can replicate fast, or that can replicate in extreme\nconditions.\no Cell content replicates before division.\n\nFts proteins and the \"divisome\"\no FtsZ aligns before division\no The most intense signal occurs at the center edges due to the 3-\ndimensional shape\n\nPeptidoglycan synthesis\no Peptidoglycan needs to be extgended for the cell to grow\no The balance needs to be right, so cell integrity isn't compromised\no Antibiotics bind to DNA binding proteins like FtsI, so that those enzymes\naren't available for the peptidoglycan synthesis, and the bacterium lyses.\n(Autolysins without autolysis)\no The FtsZ ring leaves a scar in the cell wall, which you can see later\n\nPeptidoglycan structure\no Two planes with cross-links in between. These cross-links give it its\nintegrity\no MreB allows a variety of shapes -- not just spheres\n\nExponential Growth\no Because bacteria undergo binary fission, they can replicate into mind-\nboggling numbers very fast (exponential rate)\no After two days of unregulated growth one bacterium's offspring would\nweigh more than the earth (assuming a 20 minute generation time)\no Make a logarithmic plot of change in numbers as a function of time\n\nGrowth Parameters\no Write out equations\no There will be homework problems relating to this growth\no Related growth parameters\n\nThe growth cycle\no Why aren't bacteria always doubling? What limits their growth?\nThey exhaust their nutrients, causing the growth curve to level off\nBuild up of toxic waste products\no The cell has to replicate everything before it divides\nTherefore if you move a cell from a bad medium to a good one,\nthere's a lag before it begins to grow.\no Stationary phase - in a batch culture, for the most part things stay the\nsame.\no Death - in bacteria, this is exponential, like growth (very important)\nIt's not clear what's going on here - people have speculated.\n\nTotal cell count\no Demonstration: Prof. Schauer shows the class a counting chamber\nGrid etched on with a laser\nTwo raised ridges - glass coverslip fits directly over, allowing you\nto measure the space between the platform and the coverslip -\ncount through a microscope\nThe same concept and method is used for bacterial, blood cells,\nenvironmental samples, etc.\no Problems with this method:\nNot very precise\nHard to see\nDoesn't distinguish live cells from dead ones\nRequires phase contrast microscope to count unstained cells\nDilute samples must be concentrated\n\nViable count\no This is the more common method - dilute sample many times over\no Demonstration: Prof. Schauer displays samples of test tubes with\nsuccessive dilutions - each test tube is progressively less cloudy.\no Then you plate the resulting tubes and wait for colonies to appear\no You want to count a plate with between 30 and 300 cells\nOtherwise the error becomes too high\no Demonstration: Prof. Schauer displays agar plates resulting from each\nsuccessive dilution\no This kind of evaluation is difficult for slow-growing bacteria - you have to\nleave the plate to grow for up to a month.\no This method doesn't work for bacteria that can't make colonies\n\nThese bacteria might be viable, but clump (you can use detergents\nto try to fix this problem)\nSome organisms don't separate, but come in chains\no Plating methods\nSometimes putting the agar on top is useful, because it stops the\nbacteria from moving around\n\nTurbidity as an indirect measure\no Light scattering off of organisms\no Depends on morphology of organisms - larger organisms scatter more\nlight\no You can quantify organisms by measuring the light scattering\nPhotometers\nThis is advantageous because you can still keep using the sample\n\nChemostat culture\no Instrument called a chemostat - bioreactor of sorts - you grow bacteria in\nit\no Open system\no Number of bacteria and rate of growth are kept constant\no It enables you to control both the bacterial concentration and the doubling\ntime.\n\nCardinal temperatures: extremophiles\no Temperature as an environmental condition - controls rate and yield\no For every organism, you can determine maximum, optimum, and\nminimum temperatures for growth\no The optimum is always closer to the maximum than it is to the minimum\no Classes of organisms\nSome organisms can grow in up to 113oC\nOrganisms can grow anywhere that there's water\no Psychrophiles\nIt's very clear why organisms can't grow at very high\ntemperatures: proteins denature, etc.\nHowever, it's less clear why they can't grow in low temperatures:\nyou lose hydrogen bonding, but that's about all that changes\nTrue psychrophiles, that prefer very cold temperatures, are rare\nThose organisms can't handle warmer temperatures - therefore\nthey live only in areas where it's cold all year round: the North and\nSouth Poles, glaciers.\no Hyperthermophiles\nMost of these are archaea\nArchaea probably originated at very high temperatures: thermal\nvents, magma\nThey grow in superheated, high pressure water, over 100oC\n\nThey have positive supercoiling of DNA - everything else on earth\nhas negative-coiled DNA\nProblems with membrane stability - remember, archaea have\ndifferent membranes from us (eukaryotes can never grow above\n50oC\n\nThermophiles\no Important source of enzymes for biotechnology\nDifferently colored band at Yellowstone: each colored band is a\ndifferent thermophile\n\nExtremophiles of pH and osmolarity\no They maintain their internal cell environment\nThey don't, for example, have such low pH or such high salt\nconcentration inside the cell as they do outside\no Accumulate inorganic ions or make organic solutes\no Compatible solutes\no Note: freezing is similar to dehydration: what kills cells as they freeze is\nthe loss of H2O as it forms into crystals\no Demonstration: Prof. Schauer shows the class a device for creating an\nanaerobic atmosphere for growth\no Toxic forms of oxygen"

      "content": "Open access, freely available online PLoS BIOLOGY\nFlux Analysis Uncovers Key Role\nof Functional Redundancy\nin Formaldehyde Metabolism\nChristopher J. Marx1¤, Stephen J. Van Dien2, Mary E. Lidstrom1,3*\n1 Department of Microbiology, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, United States of America, 2 United Metabolics, Seattle, Washington, United States of\nAmerica, 3 Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, United States of America\nGenome-scale analysis of predicted metabolic pathways has revealed the common occurrence of apparent redundancy\nfor specific functional units, or metabolic modules. In many cases, mutation analysis does not resolve function, and\ninstead, direct experimental analysis of metabolic flux under changing conditions is necessary. In order to use genome\nsequences to build models of cellular function, it is important to define function for such apparently redundant\nsystems. Here we describe direct flux measurements to determine the role of redundancy in three modules involved in\nformaldehyde assimilation and dissimilation in a bacterium growing on methanol. A combination of deuterium and 14C\nlabeling was used to measure the flux through each of the branches of metabolism for growth on methanol during\ntransitions into and out of methylotrophy. The cells were found to differentially partition formaldehyde among the\nthree modules depending on the flux of methanol into the cell. A dynamic mathematical model demonstrated that the\nkinetic constants of the enzymes involved are sufficient to account for this phenomenon. We demonstrate the role of\nredundancy in formaldehyde metabolism and have uncovered a new paradigm for coping with toxic, high-flux\nmetabolic intermediates: a dynamic, interconnected metabolic loop.\nCitation: Marx CJ, Van Dien SJ, Lidstrom ME (2005) Flux analysis uncovers key role of functional redundancy in formaldehyde metabolism.

The resulting methylene-H4MPT is subsequently\noxidized through a series of reactions to formate [8,16,17],\nwhich can ultimately be dissimilated to CO2 via the activity of\nmultiple formate dehydrogenases [18]. Finally, a third module\ninvolves interconversion of methylene-H4F and formate via a\nfamiliar set of H4F-dependent reactions found in most\norganisms [11,19,20]. Mutant analysis has shown that both\nthe H4MPT and H4F modules are required for growth on C1\ncompounds [8,9,10,11,12,13,19].\nTwo distinct models exist to explain the necessity of both\nthe H4MPT and H4F modules in methylotrophy, predicting\nopposite directions for the net flux through the H4F module.\nIt was suggested over 20 y ago that the H4F module functions\nin formaldehyde oxidation [21]. This predicts that the H4MPT\nand H4F modules are parallel, redundant formaldehyde\noxidation systems. Recent genetic and biochemical evidence\n[11,12,13], however, suggest that the H4F module is not\nfunctionally redundant to the H4MPT module for form\naldehyde oxidation. An alternative hypothesis suggests that\nthe H4F module functions in the reductive direction,\ngenerating methylene-H4F from formate [11,16,17]. This\nmodel suggests a single dissimilatory module (H4MPT\nmodule) and two, redundant assimilatory modules: the H4F\nmodule and the direct condensation of methylene-H4F from\nformaldehyde (Figure 1, green arrows). This model predicts\ntwo routes for generating the key assimilatory intermediate\nmethylene H4F from formaldehyde: one we will term\n''direct,'' involving the direct condensation step, and one we\nwill term ''long,'' involving the consecutive action of the\nH4MPT and H4F modules. Although the direct route (Figure\n1, green arrows) requires flux through a nonenzymatic\nreaction, assimilation via the proposed long route (Figure 1,\nblue arrows) involving the action of the H4MPT and H4F\nmodules is energetically costly due to a net expenditure of\none ATP per C1 unit. If this hypothesis is correct, the H4MPT\nmodule would play a role in both dissimilatory and\nassimilatory metabolism, in much the same way that the\ntricarboxylic acid cycle plays a dual role in growth on\nmulticarbon compounds.\nClearly, this is an example in which metabolic reconstruc\ntion is not sufficient to predict the roles of the central\nmetabolic modules involved in carbon partitioning. In\naddition, it provides a test case for how cells cope with a\nhigh-flux toxic metabolic intermediate. In order to address\nthis problem, we have used a combination of stable isotope-\nand radioisotope-labeling approaches, which has allowed the\ncomplete determination of flux through every branch of\nmethylotrophy. The results provide a dynamic picture of the\nresponse of M. extorquens AM1 during transitions in and out of\nmethylotrophy. Furthermore, a kinetic model of the key\nformaldehyde utilization systems was developed that success\nfully predicted key system dynamics. Our data resolve the\nspecific roles for three interconnected metabolic modules\nthat have two cellular outputs, assimilation and dissimilation.\nFurthermore, we have revealed a new paradigm for handling\nhigh-flux toxic intermediates: a dynamic metabolic loop that\ndemonstrates graded response to changing metabolic needs.\nResults\nDetection of Serine-Derived Mass Fragments Using Gas\nChromatography-Mass Spectrometry\nA CD3OD label tracing strategy (Figure 2) was devised to\ndirectly determine what fraction of the methylene-H4F that\nentered the serine cycle was formed from the direct\ncondensation of formaldehyde and H4F (direct route), versus\nthe fraction formed through the alternative potential route\ninvolving oxidation of formaldehyde to formate by the\nH4MPT module, followed by assimilation through the H4F\nmodule (long route). The serine that is produced from\nmethanol contains the carbon atom, and both hydrogens,\nfrom the methylene group of the methylene-H4F donor.\nSerine produced from CD3OD via the direct route contains\ntwo D, while that produced via the long route contains one D\nand in both cases these are relatively nonexchangeable C-D\nbonds. Therefore, at short labeling times (,1 min) the ratio of\nserine isotopomers with one or two D is an assay of the ratio\nof flux through the two routes.\nIn order for this label tracing method to be successful, the\nratio of serine isotopomers containing one or two deuteriums\nfrom CD3OD must be determined. Initially, cultures were\nlabeled with standard methanol (CH3OH), added to boiling\nethanol after labeling, and the derivatized H2O-soluble small\nmolecules were prepared and analyzed via gas chromatog\nraphy-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Consistent with a deriv\natized serine standard and previous work [22,23], a peak was\nobserved at approximately 8.6 min that contained two major\nions with M/z of 156 and 228 (Figure 2B and 2C).

GC-MS Method to Assay Ratio of Long Versus Direct Routes\n(A) Simplified model of formaldehyde metabolism highlighting the deuterium (in red) label-tracing strategy. Oxidation of deuterated methanol\n(CD3OD) leads to the production of formaldehyde with two deuteriums (CD2O). Direct condensation with H4F (green arrows) and conversion to\nserine via the serine cycle (Figure 1) generates serine with two deuteriums. Alternatively, methylene-H4F may be produced through the long\nroute (blue arrows; Figure 1), generating serine containing only one of the original deuteriums.

Analysis of the derivatized\nH2O-soluble small molecule preparation from wild-type\nsamples indicated a substantial increase in the proportion of\nfragments present as (þ1) and (þ2) isotopomers (.35% of total\nserine isotopomers). CD3OD labeling with a glyA mutant strain\n(CM239K.1), which lacks the initial serine-cycle enzyme, serine\nhydroxymethyltransferase, and was therefore completely\nunable to assimilate carbon from formaldehyde, produced\nno increase in (þ1) or (þ2) isotopomers (data not shown).\nAdditionally, mutants defective for the proposed long route\nfor methylene-H4F formation were tested for deuterium\nlabeling. These included the ftfL (encodes formate-H4F ligase)\nmutant CM216K.1 [11], blocked for the H4F module, and the\ndmrA (encodes dihydromethanopterin reductase) mutant\nCM212K.1 [24], which has been shown to lack H4MPT\n[25,26]. Consistent with their proposed roles, the proportion\nof (þ1) fragments dropped 8-fold for these mutants, compared\nto a modest 2-fold decrease in (þ2) fragments. These data\nindicate that both the H4F and H4MPT modules affect labeling\nof serine and are required to generate the large increase in (þ1)\nisotopomers seen with wild-type. These data also indicate that\npotential exchange reactions that could eliminate the deute\nriums do not contribute measurably to the presence of (þ1)\nions. Collectively, these data indicate that the (þ1) and (þ2)\nserine mass fragments can serve as an accurate proxy for\nmethylene-H4F generated through the long or direct routes.\nOne caveat to this statement is that a portion of the NADPH\ninvolved in generating methylene H4MPT could be derived\nfrom the oxidation of methylene H4MPT to methenyl H4MPT\nand, therefore, could have become deuterium labeled. Based\non the stoichiometry of the reactions and the known activity\nratio of NADPH- versus NADH-producing enzymes for the\nmethylene-H4MPT dehydrogenase reaction, we calculated\nthat we at most overestimate the contribution of the direct\npathway by 25% during growth on methanol, and by\nsignificantly smaller values at times with lower formaldehyde\nproduction. This prediction assumes an infinitely small intra\ncellular concentration of NADPH, so depending on the actual\npool of NADPH present, the error will be less. Therefore, our\nresults are presented as maximum ratio changes.\nWhen labeled with CD3OD, the succinate-grown wild-type\ncultures utilized to verify the GC-MS method produced a\nratio of (þ1) versus (þ2) serine mass fragments of 8.0 6 0.6.\nThus, when succinate-grown cells are first exposed to\nPLoS Biology | www.plosbiology.org\nFebruary 2005 | Volume 3 | Issue 2 | e16\n\nFlux Analysis of Redundant Modules\nFigure 3.

One hour after samples were removed from\nsuccinate- and methanol-grown cultures for the labeling\nexperiments described above, the remaining portions of the\ntwo cultures were harvested, washed, and resuspended into\nmedium containing the other substrate (methanol or succi\nnate, respectively). At four intervals during the transition to\neach of the new growth substrates (Figure 3) samples were\nharvested and analyzed via CD3OD labeling to determine the\nratio of flux capacity through the two methylene-H4F\nformation routes.

Methanol oxidation\nwas found to be 10-fold higher in methanol-grown cultures,\nand the percentage of carbon from methanol assimilated into\nbiomass was 3-fold higher as compared to succinate-grown\ncultures (Table 1). The other values incorporated into the flux\ncalculations are the stoichiometry of the serine cycle, in\nwhich two C1 units from methylene-H4F and one CO2 are\nincorporated for every C3 compound assimilated, and the\nproportion of external, unlabeled CO2 incorporated by the\nserine cycle [27]. The ten C1 fluxes (each branch arbitrarily\nlabeled ''A'' through ''J'') calculated using the concurrent\nCD3OD and 14C-methanol labeling methods are reported in\nTable 1 and shown in Figures 4 and 5.\nA comparison of the values for succinate- versus methanol-\ngrown cells shows that upon initial exposure of succinate-\ngrown cells to methanol (Figure 4 and Table 1), the\nmeasurements suggest that most (at least 99%) of the\nformaldehyde was handled by the H4MPT module (flux B),\nand only a small amount flowed through the direct route (flux\nF). Of formate made from the H4MPT module (flux B), most\n(up to 88%) was converted to CO2 via formate oxidation (flux\nC), and a smaller amount (at least 12%) flowed through the\nH4F module and into assimilation (flux E), representing at\nleast 90% of the assimilatory carbon. In contrast, for\nmethanol-grown cells (Figure 5 and Table 1), less (only about\n70%) of the formaldehyde generated from methanol flowed\nthrough the H4MPT module (flux B), with up to 30% handled\nby the direct route (flux F). Only a small portion of the\nassimilatory carbon (suggested to be about 6%) flowed\nthrough the H4F module (flux E), which represented about\n3% of the formate generated via the H4MPT module.

These\nchanges, however, roughly mirrored the transition from\nsuccinate to methanol, but were not an exact reversal (see\nFigure 5). As noted for the deuterium-labeling experiments,\nthe time periods followed in these experiments were\nsufficient to observe the majority of the transition.\nDynamic Mathematical Model of Formaldehyde\nPartitioning\nIn order to assess whether the known kinetic constraints of\nthe three modules of formaldehyde metabolism were suffi\ncient to account for the experimentally determined flux\ndynamics, a mathematical model was generated. The model\nsimulated partitioning of C1 units through the three form\naldehyde modules during growth of cells in methanol, and for\nthe transition of succinate-grown cells to methanol. The\nmodel consisted of eight ordinary differential equations,\nbased on known kinetic mechanisms, to describe the\ndynamics of the H4F and H4MPT modules and the direct\ncondensation reaction. Most binding constants, rate con\nstants, and cofactor concentrations were obtained from the\nliterature (Table 2). For the six cases in which literature values\nare not known, these were estimated as described in Materials\nand Methods. Additionally, a dynamic simulation of the\nsuccinate to methanol transition was performed. The\nmethanol uptake rate was set to the experimentally measured\nvalue at each time point (flux A, Table 1) and interpolated\nlinearly between time points to create a smooth gradient.\nStarting with the values obtained for succinate or methanol\ngrowth, the parameters were increased throughout the shift\nat a rate corresponding to the increase in methanol uptake.\nTwo key results are apparent from the comparison of the\nmodel's predictions (see Figure 3B) to the measured flux ratio\nof the two methylene-H4F production routes (see Figure 3A).\nFirst, the model did not constrain the direction of flux\nthrough the H4F module. Therefore the prediction that the\nH4F module functions in assimilation both during steady-\nstate methanol growth and upon the first exposure of\nsuccinate-grown cells to methanol indicates that the kinetic\nparameters of the module components are sufficient to\naccount for this phenomenon. Second, the correspondence\nbetween the predicted and experimentally determined\ndynamics of the switch in methylene-H4F production routes\nconfirms that the dynamics of the system are also largely\nattributable to the systems' kinetic constraints. That the\nkinetics did not exactly mimic the measured values is\npresumably partly due to differences between the actual\ninduction of enzyme activities versus the model's simplifying\nassumption that all values change in a manner directly\nproportional to changes in methanol uptake. However, the\nmodel does not suggest a significant effect of methylene\nH4MPT-derived NADPD in the deuterium-labeling studies.\nThe H4F Module Could Not Be Eliminated during Growth\non C1 Compounds\nThe combination of CD3OD and 14C-methanol label-\ntracing studies clearly demonstrate that the long route\ncontributes methylene-H4F to the serine cycle and that the\nflux through the H4F module portion of the long route (flux\nE) increases significantly during the transition to growth on\nmethanol. These results confirm the hypothesis of net\nreductive flux through this module [11,16,17]. However, this\nroute contributes only 6% of the total methylene-H4F\ngenerated during growth on methanol. Therefore, it seemed\npossible that the H4F module might be required during\ntransitions in and out of methylotrophy, but might not be\nrequired for continuous growth on methanol. Given the\navailable genetic techniques, two strategies were employed in\nan attempt to obtain mutants in one of the key H4F module\ngenes, formate-H4F ligase, during growth on C1 compounds.\nFirst, attempts were made to obtain null mutants via allelic\nexchange with cultures maintained on methanol or methyl\namine, but these efforts were unsuccessful. Second, cultures\nof the DftfL::kan mutant CM216K.1 [11] bearing the comple\nmenting plasmid pCM218 [11] were grown in medium\ncontaining methanol or methylamine without tetracycline\nfor plasmid maintenance. No plasmid-free isolates were\nobtained for CM216K.1 with pCM218 during growth on\nmethanol. However, they were obtained for wild-type with\npCM218 on methanol, or CM216K.1 with pCM218 grown on\nsuccinate. Therefore, it appears that the H4F module plays an\nessential role in methylotrophy even after cells have already\nbegun to grow on C1 compounds.\nDiscussion\nIn the formaldehyde metabolism of M. extorquens AM1,\nthree interconnected metabolic modules are present, in\nvolved in two roles: converting formaldehyde to the key\nassimilatory intermediate methylene H4F and net oxidation\nof formaldehyde to CO2. Understanding paradigms for\ndifferential roles of redundant modules is central to enabling\nbroadscale metabolic reconstruction from genome sequen\nces. In addition, methylotrophy represents an intriguing\nexample of a metabolic mode in which growth depends on\nhigh flux of a toxic metabolite, with subsequent partitioning\nof that metabolite. Other such modes are known that produce\ntoxic aldehydes, for instance, growth on ethanolamine [28]\nand other alcohols [29]. Numerous other toxic intermediates\nare known in bacteria, such as the production of hydroxyl\namine by ammonia-oxidizing bacteria [30] and mono-oxy\ngenase-dependent production of epoxyalkanes during growth\non aliphatic alkanes [31]. In addition, the liver can be exposed\nto toxic metabolites, for instance, the production of formate\nfrom acute methanol poisoning [32]. However, the metabolic\nmechanisms that allow the balancing of flux and toxicity in\nsuch situations are not well understood. Understanding\nparadigms for such metabolic responses is important for\nassessing and possibly ameliorating toxicity problems in a\nvariety of systems, including bioremediation of toxic com\npounds, chemical production in bioprocesses, and detoxifi\ncation in tissues and organs.\nThrough a combination of 14C and deuterium label-tracing\nstrategies, we have defined flux through each metabolic\nmodule in methylotrophic metabolism in M. extorquens AM1\nduring transitions into and out of methylotrophy, in which\nthe flux of formaldehyde into the system changed by a factor\nof 10. These methods had the dual advantages of possessing\nsufficient sensitivity to detect flux under all conditions tested,\nand being free from the requirement of steady-state growth\nconditions, which allowed the dynamics of growth transitions\nto be examined. Furthermore, this approach complements a\nrecently developed 13C-labeling method that measures flux\nPLoS Biology | www.plosbiology.org\nFebruary 2005 | Volume 3 | Issue 2 | e16\n\nFlux Analysis of Redundant Modules\nFigure 6. An Interconnected Metabolic Loop for Handling the Toxic\nIntermediate Formaldehyde\nA dynamic transition occurs from low to high formaldehyde flux,\nshifting the ratio of the direct versus long routes, and in the relative\nproportion of carbon oxidized to CO2 versus assimilated, creating a\nbuffer system to accommodate large changes in formaldehyde flux.\nDOI: 10.1371/journal.pbio.0030016.g006\nthrough the multicarbon branches of central metabolism [27],\nbut is inherently silent to the C1 fluxes measured here. The\napproach described here allowed us to test and confirm the\nhypothesis that the role of the H4F module during growth on\nC1 compounds is to supply methylene-H4F from formate\n[11,16,17], although the fraction of total flux passing through\nthis route is always small.\nGiven the small percentage of total flux into assimilation\nvia the H4F module during growth on methanol, why is this\nmodule required under this condition? The results presented\nhere suggest that this requirement is not alleviated even when\ncells begin to actively grow on methanol. It is possible that\nthis module generates an inducing signal for the serine cycle\nand, therefore, is necessary to maintain assimilatory flux\nduring growth on methanol. This hypothesis is consistent\nwith the genetic circuit, as two of the genes encoding key\nenzymes of the H4F module (mtdA and fch) are in an operon\nwith serine-cycle genes and are under the control of a single\nregulatory protein, QscR [33].\nOur results demonstrate a dramatic shift in flux through\nthe primary methylotrophic modules during these transi\ntions. It has long been known that all enzymes of methylo\ntrophy increase 3-6 fold in activity after induction with\nmethanol [14,16], predicting a sizable increase in total flux\ninto the system. However, the flux measurements reported\nhere show that a dynamic repartitioning occurs also. When M.\nextorquens AM1 encounters methanol, the methanol oxidation\nsystem is at low but significant activity [34]. Under these\nconditions, the flux of formaldehyde into the system is\nrelatively low (Figure 6, left panel), and most of the\nformaldehyde is oxidized to CO2 via the H4MPT module\nand formate dehydrogenase, generating NAD(P)H. Only a\ntrace amount is assimilated, almost all of that through the\nlong route involving formate and H4F intermediates. As the\nflux of formaldehyde into the system increases, a greater\npercentage begins to flow through the direct route into\nassimilatory metabolism. A smooth transition occurs during\nthe induction of the capacity in the system until approx\nimately one-third of the total formaldehyde flows through\nthis route, and assimilatory and dissimilatory metabolism are\nbalanced for rapid growth on methanol (Figure 6, right\npanel). The metabolic elegance of this interconnected,\ndynamic metabolic loop creates an effective formaldehyde\nflux buffer for transitions, in which the cell has time to\nrespond to the presence of a methylotrophic substrate,\nderiving benefit (energy) without risking buildup of a toxic\nintermediate. As the activity of the serine cycle begins to\nincrease, more formaldehyde can be safely shunted to\nassimilatory metabolism via the direct, ATP-independent\nroute, thereby ensuring the transition to growth on the C1\nsubstrate without build up of formaldehyde.\nWhat controls the rate of the nonenzymatic condensation\nof formaldehyde with H4F to form methylene-H4F, which was\nup to 150-fold greater during methanol growth than on\nsuccinate? The rate of this spontaneous reaction will be\ndetermined by the relative concentrations of reactants and\nproducts, with an equilibrium constant for this condensation\nof 3.2 3 104 [15]. Although this equilibrium constant favors\nthe production of methylene-H4F, flux will only occur if\neither the concentrations of the reactants (formaldehyde and/\nor H4F) rise above the equilibrium concentration, or\nutilization of methylene-H4F is sufficient to keep the pool\nof this metabolite below the equilibrium concentration. At\nthis time, it is not technically feasible to measure the\nintracellular concentrations of free formaldehyde or methyl\nene-H4F. However, the most likely explanation for high flux\nthrough the nonenzymatic condensation of formaldehyde\nand H4F would be draw-off of the product (methylene-H4F)\nby the serine cycle. In order to test whether the known kinetic\nparameters explain the relative utilization of the two\nmethylene-H4F production routes, a kinetic model was\nconstructed and utilized to simulate formaldehyde partition\ning during transitions to and from methylotrophic growth.\nThe ability of the model to recapitulate the observed switch\nin route utilization (see Figure 3B) indicates that the\narchitecture of the dynamic loop and the kinetic parameters\nof the responsible enzymes can predict operation of the H4F\nmodule in the assimilatory direction and are sufficient to\naccount for partitioning of C1 units into assimilatory\nmetabolism without accumulation of formaldehyde.\nIn summary, the dual-labeling approach described here for\ndirect flux measurement during metabolic transitions has not\nonly elucidated a key role for redundancy in the three\nmetabolic modules responsible for formaldehyde assimilation\nand dissimilation, but has also revealed a new paradigm for\naccommodating high-flux toxic intermediates. It is likely that\nsimilar interconnected loop systems operate for other\nmetabolites, toxic or not, and this example can now be used\nas a framework for predicting functions of other apparently\nredundant modules that may be involved in the handling of\ntoxic metabolites.\nMaterials and Methods\nBacterial strains. Wild-type M. extorquens AM1 [35] and mutant\nstrains were cultured at 30 8C in a minimal salts medium [36]\ncontaining 125 mM methanol or 15 mM succinate. A serine\nhydroxymethyltransferase mutant strain, CM239K.1 (DglyA::kan) was\ngenerated using the allelic exchange technique described previously\n[37].\nCD3OD labeling and GC-MS. CD3OD (99.8%; Cambridge Isotope\nLaboratories, Andover, Massachusetts, United States) to a final\nconcentration of 1 mM was added to washed cultures that had been\nresuspended to an OD600 = 1 in order to label cell metabolites with\ndeuterium for analysis by GC-MS. After shaking for 20 s at room\nPLoS Biology | www.plosbiology.org\nFebruary 2005 | Volume 3 | Issue 2 | e16\n\n1⁄2\n\ntemperature the 2-ml suspension was added to three volumes of\nboiling 100% ethanol for instant lysis. Following centrifugation, the\nsoluble fraction was dried, resuspended in distilled H2O, and\ncentrifuged again to remove H2O-insoluble components. The result\ning H2O-soluble small molecule fraction was then derivatized with\nethyl chloroformate and trifluoroacetic acid as previously described\n[22,23]. All labeling experiments were performed three times.\nGC-MS methods and data analysis. GC-MS experiments were\nperformed using an Agilent 6890 gas chromatograph/Agilent 5973\nquadrupole mass selective detector (electron impact ionization)\noperated at 70 eV equipped with an Agilent 7683 autosampler/\ninjector (Hewlett-Packard, Palo Alto, California, United States). The\nMS was operated in selected ion monitoring mode to detect M/z =\n156/157/158/228/229/230 from 7 min to the end of the method. The\nGC oven temperature started at an initial temperature of 60 8C,\nramping at 20 8C min1 to 130 8C, 4 8C min1 to 155 8C, and then\n120 8C min1 to a final temperature of 300 8C that was held for 5 min.\nFlow through the column was held constant at 1 ml min1. The\ninjection volume was 1 ll and the machine was run in splitless mode.\nThe temperature of the inlet was 230 8C, the interface temperature\nwas 270 8C, and the quadrupole temperature was 150 8C. The column\nutilized was an HP-5MS (Hewlett-Packard).\nGC-MS data were analyzed using Agilent Enhanced ChemStation\nG1701CA (Hewlett-Packard). The two mass clusters for serine, M/z =\n156/157/158, and 228/229/230, represent fragments of ECF-TFAA\nderivatized serine (C10H14O6NF3) that have lost one or both of the\ncarboxyl ethyl esters. The data were corrected for the natural\nabundance of heavy isotopes in the derivatized serine fragments,\nusing proportions calculated with Isoform 1.02 (MS Search Program\nfor Windows, National Institute of Standards and Technology,\nGaithersburg, Maryland, United States). For each sample, the ratio\nof D þ 1)/D þ 2) was calculated for both mass clusters and averaged.\nThe mean and standard error for these data were then calculated for\nthe three replicates of each experiment.\nAssimilation and CO2 production rates. The rate of 14C-CO2\nproduction and assimilation of labeled carbon from 14C-methanol\nwas determined concurrently with the CD3OD labeling described\nabove using a modification of a previously described method [11].\nA portion of the labeled cell suspensions was filtered (0.2 lM\nPVDF, Millipore, Billerica, Massachusetts, United States) to deter\nmine net assimilation. All measured and calculated fluxes were\ndetermined using the data from each of the three replicate\nexperiments and then utilized to determine the mean and standard\nerror for each flux.\nAdditional values incorporated into flux calculations. It has been\ndetermined previously that 63.3% of the total CO2 incorporated\noriginates directly from CO2 produced from the oxidation of\nmethanol [27]. This value cannot be determined under the nonsteady\nstate conditions used in the experiments described here, so this value\nwas incorporated directly into our calculations. The sensitivity of the\ncalculated fluxes to a 2-fold increase or decrease in the determined\nratio of 1.73:1.00 internal:external CO2 incorporated into the serine\ncycle was examined. Besides the direct effect on relative fluxes of\ninternal and external CO2 into the serine cycle, the calculated\nincorporation of C1 units from methylene-H4F would vary no more\nthan 7%, which would be balanced by a change in the dissimilatory\nflux through the H4MPT module and formate dehydrogenase of less\nthan 6%. Therefore, deviations in the ratio of methanol-derived and\nexternal CO2 incorporation from the reported work [27] would not\nsignificantly alter the calculated fluxes.\nDynamic model. The dynamic model of the formaldehyde\noxidation and assimilation modules consisted of eight ordinary\ndifferential equations, each describing the accumulation of a\nmetabolite involved in the H4F and H4MPT modules. These\nequations were derived in a straightforward manner from the\nkinetic expressions given below. The production of formaldehyde\nfrom methanol was set to the measured rate of methanol uptake for\neach experiment. All enzymatic reactions were treated with either\nuni- or bimolecular reversible Michaelis-Menten kinetics, with the\nequilibrium constants taken from the literature [38]. In cases where\nKeq . 200, the reverse reaction was ignored for simplicity. Finally,\nsince the dynamics of serine and glycine were not included in this\nmodel, serine hydroxymethyltransferase was modeled as an irrever\nsible unimolecular Michaelis-Menten reaction, with the effects of all\nmetabolites other than methylene-H4F accounted for in an effective\nVmax. The total internal concentrations of H4F and H4MPT\nderivatives were set equal to 0.15 and 0.4 mM, respectively [38].\nConcentrations of other energy and redox cofactors (ATP, NADH,\netc.) were assumed equal to those present in Escherichia coli [39]. The\nparameters used in the simulation are listed in Table 2. All Kms\nPLoS Biology | www.plosbiology.org\nFlux Analysis of Redundant Modules\ncould be obtained from the literature (see Table 2), except for that\nof reaction 5. This Km was set arbitrarily to 50 lM, which results in\nthe reaction proceeding at half-maximal rate. Many of the values for\nVmax could be directly calculated from specific activities found in the\nliterature, for both growth on methanol and succinate. To allow for\nexperimental error in the measured rate constants, and to account\nfor the fact that kinetics measured in vitro do not necessarily\ncorrelate exactly with what occurs inside the cell, these values were\nallowed to vary within 50% during the fitting procedure described\nbelow. For the remaining parameters, a numerical error minimiza\ntion technique was used to find the set of parameters yielding model\npredictions with the best fit to the experimental flux distributions,\nwhen integrated to steady state. This was first done for methanol\ngrowth, then repeated for succinate growth. The rate constant for\nspontaneous formaldehyde condensation (k6) was forced to be the\nsame on succinate as on methanol, since this is a fundamental\nchemical property that is not affected by gene induction. All reverse\nrate constants were calculated directly from the forward constants,\nbinding constants, and Keq. The spontaneous condensation of\nformaldehyde with H4MPT was assumed to be negligible under\nphysiological conditions compared to the formaldehyde activating\nenzyme reaction [9]. All simulations were performed in MATLAB 6.5\n(MathWorks, Natick, Massachusetts, United States) using the ODE\nsolving function ''ode15s.'' The error minimization was also done in\nMATLAB, using an evolutionary algorithm written previously [27].\nr1 1⁄4 V6 H4MPT þ V1\n1⁄2H4MPT\n1⁄2HCHO\n1⁄2\nKm1a þ 1⁄2H4MPT\nKm1b þ 1⁄2HCHO\nr2a 1⁄4 V2a\n1⁄2me H4MPT\n1⁄2NAD\nKm2a þ 1⁄2me H4MPT\nKm2b þ 1⁄2NAD\nr2b 1⁄4 V2b\n1⁄2me H4MPT\n1⁄2NADP\nKm2a þ 1⁄2me H4MPT\nKm2b þ 1⁄2NADP\nr3 1⁄4\nKm3rV31⁄2mn H4MPT Km3Vrev 1⁄2formyl H4MPT\nKm3Km3r þ Km3r1⁄2mn H4MPT þ Km31⁄2formyl H4MPT\nformylH4MPT1⁄2MFR\nformylMFR1⁄2H4MPT\nV4\n1⁄2\nKm4aKm4b\nV4r\n1⁄2\nKm4arKm4br\nformylH4MPT\nMFR\nformylMFR\nH4MPT\nr4 1⁄4\n1 þ 1⁄2\nKm4a\nþ 1⁄2\nKm4b\n\n1 þ 1⁄2\nKm4ar\nþ 1⁄2\nKm4br\n\nr5 1⁄4 V5\n1⁄2formyl MFR\nKm5 þ 1⁄2formyl MFR\nr6 1⁄4 V61⁄2H4F1⁄2HCHO\nmeH4F1⁄2NADP\nmnH4F1⁄2NADPH\nV7\n1⁄2\nKm7aKm7b\nV7r\n1⁄2\nKm7arKm7br\n\nr7 1⁄4\nmeH4F\nNADP\nmnH4F\nNADPH\n1 þ 1⁄2\nKm7a\nþ 1⁄2\nKm7b\n\n1 þ 1⁄2\nKm7ar\nþ 1⁄2\nKm7br\n\nr8 1⁄4\nKm8rV81⁄2mn H4F Km8Vrev 1⁄2formyl H4F\nKm8Km8r þ Km8r1⁄2mn H4F þ Km81⁄2formyl H4F\nATP\nr9 1⁄4 V91⁄2formyl H4F V9\nrev 1⁄2\nADP\n1⁄2HCOOH1⁄2H4F\nr10 1⁄4 V10\n1⁄2HCOOH\nKm10 þ 1⁄2HCOOH\nr11 1⁄4 V 911\n1⁄2me H4F\nKm10 þ 1⁄2me H4F\nAbbreviations as in Table 2.\nFebruary 2005 | Volume 3 | Issue 2 | e16\n\nFlux Analysis of Redundant Modules\nSupporting Information\nAccession Numbers\nThe GenBank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Genbank) accession num\nbers for genes discussed in this paper are dmrA (AY093431), ftfL\n(AY279316), and glyA (L33463).\nAcknowledgments\nWe would like to thank L.

Craig Venter Institute, Joint Technology Center, Rockville, Maryland, United States of\nAmerica, 3 Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona, United States of America\nMutualistic intracellular symbiosis between bacteria and insects is a widespread phenomenon that has contributed to\nthe global success of insects. The symbionts, by provisioning nutrients lacking from diets, allow various insects to\noccupy or dominate ecological niches that might otherwise be unavailable. One such insect is the glassy-winged\nsharpshooter (Homalodisca coagulata), which feeds on xylem fluid, a diet exceptionally poor in organic nutrients.\nPhylogenetic studies based on rRNA have shown two types of bacterial symbionts to be coevolving with\nsharpshooters: the gamma-proteobacterium Baumannia cicadellinicola and the Bacteroidetes species Sulcia muelleri.\nWe report here the sequencing and analysis of the 686,192-base pair genome of B. cicadellinicola and approximately\n150 kilobase pairs of the small genome of S. muelleri, both isolated from H. coagulata. Our study, which to our\nknowledge is the first genomic analysis of an obligate symbiosis involving multiple partners, suggests striking\ncomplementarity in the biosynthetic capabilities of the two symbionts: B. cicadellinicola devotes a substantial portion\nof its genome to the biosynthesis of vitamins and cofactors required by animals and lacks most amino acid\nbiosynthetic pathways, whereas S. muelleri apparently produces most or all of the essential amino acids needed by its\nhost. This finding, along with other results of our genome analysis, suggests the existence of metabolic codependency\namong the two unrelated endosymbionts and their insect host. This dual symbiosis provides a model case for studying\ncorrelated genome evolution and genome reduction involving multiple organisms in an intimate, obligate mutualistic\nrelationship. In addition, our analysis provides insight for the first time into the differences in symbionts between\ninsects (e.g., aphids) that feed on phloem versus those like H. coagulata that feed on xylem. Finally, the genomes of\nthese two symbionts provide potential targets for controlling plant pathogens such as Xylella fastidiosa, a major\nagroeconomic problem, for which H. coagulata and other sharpshooters serve as vectors of transmission.\nCitation: Wu D, Daugherty SC, Van Aken SE, Pai GH, Watkins KL, et al.

DOI: 10.1371/journal.pbio.0040188\nIntroduction\nThrough mutualistic symbioses with bacteria, eukaryotes\nhave been able to acquire metabolic capabilities that in turn\nhave allowed the utilization of otherwise unavailable eco-\nlogical niches. Among the diverse examples of such symbio-\nses, those involving bacteria that live inside the cells of their\nhost are of great interest. These ''endo''-symbioses played a\ncentral role in the early evolution of eukaryotes (e.g., the\nestablishment of the mitochondria and chloroplasts) and in\nmany more recent diversification events such as animals\nliving at deep-sea vents, corals, blood-feeding flies, carpenter\nants, and several clades of sap-feeding insects.\nInsects that feed primarily or entirely on sap are a virtual\nbreeding ground for symbioses because this liquid rarely\ncontains sufficient quantities of the nutrients that animals are\nunable to make for themselves. For example, the sole diet of\nmost aphids is sap from phloem which is the component of\nthe plant vascular system normally used to transport sugars\nand other organic nutrients. Despite the presence of many\nnutrients, phloem usually has little, if any, of the ''essential''\namino acids that cannot be synthesized by animals. To\ncompensate, aphids engage in an obligate symbiosis with\nbacteria in the genus Buchnera, which, in exchange for sugar\nand simple, nonessential amino acids, synthesize the needed\nessential amino acids for their hosts.\nThe exact details of aphid-Buchnera interactions have been\ndifficult to determine because no Buchnera has been cultivated\noutside its host. This limitation has been circumvented to a\nlarge degree by sequencing and analysis of multiple Buchnera\ngenomes [1-3], which have provided detailed insights into the\nbiology, evolution, and ecology of these symbioses.

A critical component of\nthese genomic studies is that, in most aphids, Buchnera is the\nonly symbiont [4]. This implies that when genome-based\nmetabolic pathway reconstructions suggest that a particular\nBuchnera is unable to make all the essential nutrients for its\nhost, either the reconstructions are wrong, or the host must be\ngetting those nutrients from its diet. For example, although\none of the Buchnera strains is predicted to not be able to\nincorporate inorganic sulfur for the production of cysteine\nand other compounds, sulfur-containing organic compounds\nare known to occur in the diet of its host aphid [2].\nIn many other sap-feeding insects, including some aphids,\nseveral heritable bacterial types are found often living in\nclose proximity within specialized structures in the insect\nbody (e.g., [5-9]). This is apparently the case for all insects\nthat are strict xylem-sap feeders, which include cicadas,\nspittlebugs, and some leafhoppers [5]. Xylem is the compo-\nnent of the plant vascular system that is primarily used to\ntransport water and salts from the roots to the rest of the\nplant. Xylem sap has the lowest nitrogen or carbon content of\nany plant component and contains few organic compounds\n[10]. Although the composition varies among plant species\nand developmental stages, xylem fluid is always nutrient-\npoor, containing mostly inorganic compounds and minerals\nwith small amounts of amino acids and organic acids [11-15].\nAs in phloem, the amino acids consist mainly of nonessential\ntypes such as glutamine, asparagine, and aspartic acid, with all\nessential ones absent or present in very low amounts.\nAmong xylem-feeders, sharpshooters (Insecta: Hemiptera:\nCicadellidae: Cicadellinae) are a prominent group of about\n2,000 species [10], many of which are major pests of\nagriculture due to their roles as vectors of plant pathogens.\nSharpshooters are known to possess two bacterial symbionts.\nOne, called Candidatus Baumannia cicadellinicola (hereafter\nBaumannia), resembles Buchnera in having small genome size\nand a biased nucleotide composition favoring adenine and\nthymine (A þ T) and in belonging to the Enterobacteriales\ngroup in the Gammaproteobacteria [16]. The other symbiont,\nwhich was recently named Candidatus Sulcia muelleri (here-\nafter Sulcia), is in the Bacteroidetes phylum (formerly called the\nCytophaga-Flexibacter-Bacteroides, or CFB, phylum) and is\ndistributed widely in related insect hosts [9]. Both symbionts\nare vertically transmitted in eggs and are housed in a\nspecialized bacteriome within developing nymphs and adults,\nand molecular phylogenetic studies show that both symbionts\nrepresent ancient associations dating to the origin of\nsharpshooters (Baumannia) or earlier (Sulcia) [5,9,16].\nWe sought to apply genome sequencing and analysis\nmethods to the sharpshooter symbioses. For a host species,\nwe selected the glassy-winged sharpshooter, Homalodisca\ncoagulata. This pest species has a rapidly expanding geo-\ngraphic range and inflicts major crop damage as a vector for\nthe bacterium Xylella fastidiosa, the agent of Pierce's disease of\ngrapes and other plant diseases [10]. Initially, we focused on\nthe Baumannia symbiont with the idea that comparisons with\nthe related Buchnera species would allow us to better identify\ndifferences that related to xylem versus phloem feeding.\nAfter completing the genome of this Baumannia, analysis\nrevealed that many pathways that we expected to be present\nwere missing. In contrast to the Buchnera-aphid symbioses, a\nsecond symbiont is present in sharpshooters, so we could not\nassume that the nutrients that would have been made by the\nmissing pathways must be in the sharpshooter diet. Despite\ntechnical difficulties, we were able to obtain a significant\nportion of the genome of the Sulcia from the same wild-\ncaught samples of H. coagulata.\nHere we present the analysis of these two genomic datasets\nand the striking finding that the symbionts appear to work in\nconcert, and possibly even share metabolites, to produce all of\nthe nutrients needed by the host to survive on its xylem diet.\nResults/Discussion\nGeneral Features of the Baumannia Genome and\nPredicted Genes\nThe genome of Baumannia consists of one circular\nchromosome of 686,192 base pairs (bp) with an average G þ\nC content of 33.23% (Table 1). The genome size closely\nmatches an earlier estimate from gel electrophoresis [16].\nBaumannia has neither a strong GC skew pattern nor a dnaA\nhomolog--two features commonly used to identify origins of\nreplication in bacteria. A putative origin was identified and\ndesignated as position 1, based on a weak but clear transition\nin oligonucleotide skew.\nA total of 46 noncoding RNA genes were identified: six\nrRNAs (two sets of 16S, 5S, and 23S), one small RNA, and 39\ntRNAs including at least one for each of the 20 amino acids. A\ntotal of 605 putative protein-coding genes (CDSs) were\nidentified in the genome, and 89.9% of these can be assigned\na putative biological function. An overview of the Baumannia\ngenome and its encoded genes is illustrated in Figure 1, and\nfeatures of these genes are summarized in Table S1. Only four\nof the CDSs lack detectable homologs in GenBank or other\ncomplete genomes and thus can be considered ''orphan''\ngenes.\nEvolution of Baumannia and the Genomes of Intracellular\nOrganisms\nGenome sequences have been found to be very useful in\nproviding for better resolution and accuracy in phylogenetic\ntrees than is achieved using single genes such as rRNA genes\n[17]. Although there are many ways to build genome-based\ntrees, one particularly powerful approach is to identify\northologous genes between species and to combine align-\nments of these genes into a single alignment. We built a tree\nfor Baumannia and related species from 45 ribosomal proteins\nusing this concatenation approach (Figure 2A). This tree\nsupports the rRNA-based grouping of Baumannia with the\ninsect endosymbionts of the genera Buchnera, Wigglesworthia\n(symbionts of tsetse flies), and Blochmania (symbionts of ants)\n[16]. However, the branching order is different in the protein\ntree with Baumannia being the deepest branching symbiont.\nAs in prior genomic studies [18], the insect endosymbionts in\nthe tree in Figure 2A are monophyletic (i.e., they share a\ncommon ancestor to the exclusion of all other species for\nwhich genomes are available). A possible close relationship of\nBaumannia to the other symbionts in the group is further\nsupported by the presence of a substantial number of\nsegments of conserved gene order (Figure 2B).\nAll of these insect endosymbionts, including Baumannia,\nexhibit many genome-level trends commonly found in intra-\ncellular organisms when compared to free-living relatives,\nincluding a smaller genome, lower G þ C content, a higher\nPLoS Biology | www.plosbiology.org\nJune 2006 | Volume 4 | Issue 6 | e188\nDual Symbiosis of Sharpshooters\n\naverage predicted isoelectric point for encoded proteins, and\nmore rapidly evolving proteins (Table 1, Figure 2A). Of\ncritical importance to understanding these trends is that they\noccur in all types of intracellular organisms (e.g., mutualists\nand pathogens) from across the tree of life (archaea, bacteria,\nand eukaryotes). Much research has focused on trying to\nunderstand the mechanisms underlying these trends for\nwhich there are two major hypotheses: the loss of DNA\nrepair genes resulting in subsequent changes in mutation\npatterns or changes in population genetic parameters that\nlead to more genetic drift [19,20].\nAs a global explanation, the population genetic forces have\nmore support (e.g., [21-23]), but the issue is far from resolved.\nOne reason for this lack of resolution is that it is usually\ndifficult to reconstruct the early events in the evolution of\nintracellularity. This insect endosymbiont group has many\nadvantages that have made it a model system for resolving\nthese early events. The addition of the Baumannia genome\nfurther improves the utility of this group for reasons we\ndetail below.\nOne limitation of studies of the evolution of intracellular\norganisms is that the evolutionary separation between free-\nliving and intracellular species is usually very large. For\nexample, although much can be learned about recent\nmitochondrial evolution by comparative analysis of mito-\nchondrial genomes, it is not even known what subgroup of\nAlphaproteobacteria contains the closest free-living relative of\nthese organelles. This is because the mitochondrial symbiosis\noriginated billions of years ago. The insect endosymbionts\nlack this limitation both because their symbioses evolved\nrelatively recently and because of the large diversity of\ngenomes available for the Gammaproteobacteria. To make the\nmost use of these benefits, it is imperative to have an accurate\npicture of the phylogeny of the symbionts. The addition of the\nBaumannia genome is useful in this regard because its proteins\nappear to be evolving more slowly (as indicated by shorter\nbranch lengths in Figure 2A) than those in the other\nendosymbionts. Having one organism with relatively short\nbranch lengths in this group makes it more likely that the\nmonophyly of the insect endosymbionts in trees is a reflection\nof their true history and not an artifact of phylogenetic\nreconstruction known as long-branch attraction.\nThe branch-length finding is an example of how Baumannia\ncan be considered as a ''missing link'' in that it is an\nintermediate in many ways between the other insect endo-\nsymbionts and free-living species. This is the case not only for\nbranch length but also for phylogenetic position (it is the\ndeepest branching species), isoelectric point (pI), and G þ C\ncontent (Table 1). By filling in the gaps between the free-\nliving and intracellular species, the Baumannia genome should\nallow better inferences of the early events in the evolution of\nintracellularity.\nBaumannia is not intermediate in value between free-living\nspecies and other insect endosymbionts for all ''intracellular''\nfeatures. For example, its genome size is smaller than that of\nsome of the other endosymbionts. This is an important\nfinding since the absolute values for many other features are\nhighly correlated, both in this group and in other symbiont\ngroups [24]. An example of this is shown for pI and G þ C\ncontent (Figure 3). Another way of looking at this is that the\nBaumannia genome has shrunk more than one might expect\nbased on its other intracellular features. This decoupling of\nTable 1.

For example, one explanation for the pattern in\nBaumannia is that although it has experienced more gene loss\nthan some of the other insect endosymbionts, it has\nmaintained the most complete set of DNA repair genes for\nthe group (Table 2). This retention of repair functions may\nhave slowed its rate of change in other features, such as\nsequence change. If true, this suggests that, although the\ngeneral differences between intracellular and free-living\nspecies may be due to population genetic forces, the variation\namong intracellular species may be due in part to variation in\nDNA repair. Consistent with this is the finding that species\nwith the longest branch lengths in the trees (Wigglesworthia\nand Blochmania, Figure 2A) are those that are missing the\nmismatch repair genes (Table 2).\nThe differential loss of repair genes among organisms that\nshare many other genome properties allows the insect\nendosymbiont group to serve as a model for studying the\nlong-term effects of loss of various repair processes. For\nexample, the consequences for genome evolution of losing\nrecA can be examined by comparing Baumannia and Wig-\nglesworthia, which retain it, to Buchnera, which lack it. The same\nlogic can be used to study the effects of the loss of the DNA\nreplication initiation gene dnaA which is missing from\nBaumannia (see above), Wigglesworthia, and Blochmannia\n[18,25] but is present in the other insect endosymbionts.\nAlthough the species without recA may be able to survive with\nlittle or no recombination, those lacking dnaA must make use\nof alternative initiation pathways. Some alternatives such as\nFigure 1.

The recBCD genes may play some role in initiation. This\nwould explain why the recBCD genes are present in all insect\nendosymbionts (Table 2) including those missing recA, which\nis required for the ''normal'' role of recBCD in recombination.\nSingle Nucleotide Polymorphisms Are Abundant in the\nBaumannia Population\nGenetic variation among individuals is both a complication\nof genome sequencing projects of uncultured species and a\nvaluable source of information about microbial populations.\nFor the Baumannia data, we used a stringent search protocol\nthat may have missed some true polymorphisms but should\nhave eliminated variation that was due to sequencing errors\nor cloning artifacts (see Materials and Methods). In total, we\nidentified 104 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and\ntwo insertion-deletion differences (indels) that fit these\ncriteria. Details of the locations and types of polymorphisms\nare given in Table 3.\nSince our DNA was isolated from the symbionts of\nhundreds of hosts, one major question is whether the\nobserved polymorphisms were between symbionts within\none host or between hosts. We used polymerase chain\nreaction surveys of individual insects to address this question.\nOf the 40 insects for which sequences were obtained\nindividually for two loci, 35 showed identity to the consensus\nsequence for the Baumannia genome and five possessed the\nalternative alleles that were present as minority bases at four\nsites (two per fragment). No polymorphism was detected\nwithin individual hosts. Thus, the polymorphisms that we\nidentified are real, and they reflect differences between\nsymbionts of different hosts.\nSince the Baumannia can be treated as maternally inherited\nmarkers, the finding of significant levels of polymorphism\nbetween hosts suggests that the sampled population contains\nindividuals from two separate origins. This is somewhat in\nconflict with theories suggesting a single introduction of a\nsmall number of individuals into California [10] but is\nconsistent with results from recent mitochondrial analysis [27].\nSequence polymorphisms have been detected in genomic\nstudies of other insect endosymbionts [3,28]. The most relevant\none for comparison to Baumannia is a study of the ant\nendosymbiont Blochmannia pennsylvanicus, although we note\nthat the criteria they used for detecting a polymorphism were\nsomewhat less stringent than ours [28]. The percentage of the\nSNPs that are in coding regions is different in the two species\n(81% in Baumannia and 65% in B. pennsylvanicus), but this is in\nline with differences in gene-coding density (88% in Baumannia\nand 76% in B. pennsylvanicus). For both species, the percentage\nof SNPs in protein-coding genes that represent synonymous\ndifferences is higher than expected from random changes\ngiven the genomic base compositions (52% in Baumannia and\n62% in B. pennsylvanicus). This indicates ongoing purifying\nselection in both genomes. The most significant difference\nbetween the species is the higher ratio of transitions to\ntransversions in B. pennsylvanicus (2.9 versus 1.4 in Baumannia;\nTable 3). We propose that this is due to the absence of\nmismatch repair genes in B. pennsylvanicus (as discussed above),\nwhich in other species leads to an increase in transition\nmutations [29]. An absence of mismatch repair would also\nexplain the higher incidence of indels in B. pennsylvanicus.\nMetabolic Reconstructions Provide Insight into the\nBiology of Baumannia\nPredictions of the metabolism of an organism from its\ngenome sequence are critical to studies of uncultured\norganisms because of the difficulty of experimental studies.\nWe have generated such a prediction for Baumannia (Figure\n4). Although all such predictions should be viewed as\nhypotheses, not facts, they are greatly improved by having\nclosely related species for which experimental studies are\navailable. This is yet another advantage of working on the\ninsect symbionts in the Gammaproteobacteria. For example,\nalmost all Baumannia genes have clearcut orthologs in well-\nstudied organisms such as Escherichia coli.\nAs expected, based on its small genome size, Baumannia has\na relatively limited repertoire of synthetic capabilities. There\nare some important features of its predicted metabolism, and\nwe discuss these in this and the next few sections of this\npaper, calling attention in particular to those of relevance to\nthe host-symbiont interaction.\nBaumannia is predicted to synthesize its own cell wall and\nplasma membrane, processes known to be lost in some\nintracellular species. It is, however, apparently unable to\nsynthesize the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) commonly found in\nthe outer membrane of other Gram-negative bacteria. The\nsame is true for Buchnera species but not for Wigglesworthia\nand Blochmannia. The functional significance of this differ-\nence is unclear. On one hand, lipid A (the lipid component of\nthe LPS) is generally highly toxic to animal cells; thus, LPS\nmay be disadvantageous for endosymbionts and discarded\nduring their evolution. Alternatively, the difference may\nreflect differences in the packaging of symbionts within the\nhost bacteriocytes. Buchnera and Baumannia cells are sur-\nrounded by host-derived vesicles, while Wigglesworthia and\nBlochmannia directly contact the host cytoplasm.\nThe findings in regard to sugar metabolism are consistent\nwith Baumannia acquiring sugars from its host and using them\nfor energy metabolism.

For example, the step normally carried\nout by erythrose 4-phosphate dehydrogenase (Epd) in the\npyridoxal 59-phosphate pathway might be carried out by\nglyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GapA) as seen in\nsome other species [30].\nThere are some compounds for which we could identify\nhomologs of all known genes in biosynthetic pathways.\nHowever, some enzymes in these pathways are still unknown\nin any organism, and thus we could not identify them here.\nThis is true for the pyrimidine phosphatase in the riboflavin\npathway and the dihydroneopterin monophosphate dephos-\nphorylase in the folic acid pathway. We believe it is likely that\nthese pathways are complete in Baumannia and that, due to its\nultracompact gene pool, Baumannia provides an ideal\nopportunity to identify the genes encoding the enzymes for\nthese steps.\nPerhaps most interesting are the pathways for which we\ncould identify genes underlying many downstream steps but\nfor which Baumannia would need to import some intermedi-\nates to feed those steps. For example, Baumannia encodes genes\nfor the last three steps for siroheme synthesis, and the last step\nof heme O pathway, but candidate genes underlying the\nupstream steps could not be identified. Thus, Baumannia needs\nto import prophobilinogen and protoheme as substrates for\nthese incomplete pathways. This pattern is particularly\napparent in that Baumannia appears to be able to synthesize\nmany cofactors from amino acids but is unable to synthesize\nthe amino acid precursors. Examples of such pathways and the\namino acid required include thiamin (tyrosine), biotin\n(alanine), pyridine nucleotides (aspartate), and folate and\npyridoxal 59-phosphate (glutamine and glutamate). This\nsuggests that Baumannia must import these amino acids. The\nlack of amino acid biosynthesis pathways also makes it a\nnecessity for Baumannia to import 2-ketovaline as a precursor\nfor the synthesis of pantothenate and coenzyme A.\nDue to the diversity of vitamin and cofactor synthesis\npathways that are present, we conclude that Baumannia is\nproviding its host with these compounds due to their low\nabundance in its diet. In this respect Baumannia is more\nsimilar to Wigglesworthia, the symbiont of tsetse flies, than to\nBuchnera.\nAmino Acid Biosynthetic Pathways Are Generally Absent\nfrom Baumannia and Likely Are Found in Another\nOrganism in the System\nIn contrast to what is seen for vitamin and cofactor\nsynthesis, Baumannia is predicted to encode a very limited set\nof amino acid synthesis pathways. The few capabilities that\nare present include histidine biosynthesis, synthesis of\nmethionine if external homoserine is provided, and the\nability to make chorismate but not to use it as substrate for\nproduction of aromatic amino acids as in most bacterial\nTable 3.

Except for histidine, no complete pathways for the\nsynthesis of any amino acids essential to the host are present.\nThe lack of amino acid synthesis pathways is apparently\ncompensated by an ability to import amino acids from the\nenvironment using a general amino acid ABC transporter, an\narginine/lysine ABC transporter, a lysine permease, and a\nproton/sodium-glutamate symport protein, although the gene\nfor the latter is disrupted by one frameshift. The import of\namino acids is apparently used not just for making proteins\nbut also for energy metabolism. The latter is evident by the\npresence of the aspartate ammonia-lyase AspA, which could\nbe used to convert L-aspartate to fumarate, which in turn can\nbe fed into the tricarboxylic acid cycle.\nThe absence of essential amino acid synthesis pathways from\nBaumannia implies that both the host and Baumannia must\nobtain amino acids from some external source or sources. The\nsole diet of H. coagulata is xylem sap [10], in which essential\namino acids are rare to absent; however, a substantial portion\nof the nitrogen in xylem occurs in the form of certain\nnonessential amino acids, including glutamine, aspartic acid,\nand asparagine (e.g., [11,14,31,32]). The essential amino acid\nsynthesis pathways have not been found in any animal species\nstudied to date, and nutritional studies in insects indicate that\nthese compounds are required nutrients in insects as in\nmammals. Thus, the most plausible alternative is that another\norganism that is reliably present in the ''ecosystem'' of the host\nbody is synthesizing the missing amino acids.\nAnalysis of Leftover Shotgun Sequence Reads Reveals the\nPresence of Amino Acid Synthesis Genes in Organisms\nOther than Baumannia\nThe most likely candidate for another organismal source of\nthe amino acid synthesis pathways is Sulcia, the other\ncoevolving symbiont found in bacteriomes mentioned above.\nAlthough we did not set out to sequence the Sulcia genome as\npart of this project, we realized we might have inadvertently\nacquired some of it since many sequence reads from the\nshotgun sequencing did not assemble with the Baumannia\ngenome. These reads derived from cells of other organisms\nthat were present in the tissue samples we used to isolate\nDNA for the Baumannia sequencing. An initial search of these\nsequence reads revealed the presence of homologs of genes\nwith roles in the synthesis of essential amino acids. However,\nwe could not conclude that these reads were from Sulcia, since\nthere could have been cells of other organisms in the sample\nas well. To sort the extra reads into taxonomic bins, we\nadapted methods we have used to sort sequences from\nenvironmental shotgun sequencing projects (see Materials\nand Methods) and were able to assign non-Baumannia\nsequences to three main groups: host, Wolbachia related, and\nSulcia related.\nThe finding of some Wolbachia in the sample was not\nsurprising since rRNA surveys have shown that these\nalphaproteobacterial relatives of Rickettsia are found in\nmany sharpshooters including H. coagulata. We note that we\ndid not detect any sequences from the previously sequenced\nphytopathogen X. fastidiosa, which colonizes the surface of the\nforegut and is not present in the bacteriomes that we used for\nDNA isolation. In addition, although some of our sequences\nshow high identity to sequences annotated as being from a\nphytoplasma, we believe this annotation is incorrect. The\n''phytoplasma'' DNA was isolated from the saliva of the\nleafhopper Orosius albicinctus [33]. However, all the sequences\nin our sample that showed matches to sequences annotated as\n''phytoplasma''-like show phylogenetic relationships to the\nBacteroidetes phylum. In addition, Sulcia is known to be a\nsymbiont of species in the Deltocephalinae, the leafhopper\nsubfamily containing O. albicinctus [9]. Thus, the putative\n''phytoplasma''-like sequences with matches in our sample are\nlikely from the Sulcia symbiont of O. albicinctus. Why these\nsequences appeared in samples from salivary secretions is\nunclear.\nAmino Acid Synthesis Pathways Are in Sulcia and Not\nOther Organisms in the Sample\nOf the essential amino acid synthesis genes identified in the\nextra shotgun sequence reads, the vast majority (31 of 32)\nwere assigned to the Sulcia bin. In contrast, only one gene\n(argB) was found in the Wolbachia bin and none were found in\nthe host bin. We therefore sought to obtain as much sequence\ninformation as possible from the Sulcia symbionts in this\nsystem. First, we completed the sequence of all plasmid clones\nFigure 4. Predicted Metabolic Pathways in Baumannia and the Predicted Amino Acid Biosynthesis Pathways Encoded by the Partial Genome Sequence\nof Sulcia\nGenes that are present are in red and the corresponding catalytic pathways are illustrated in solid black lines; the genes that are absent in the\nBaumannia genome and genes that have not been identified in the partial Sulcia genome are in gray, and the corresponding metabolic steps are\nillustrated in gray lines.\nDOI: 10.1371/journal.pbio.0040188.g004\nFigure 5.

End-sequencing of this library\nidentified some additional Sulcia-derived clones, and these,\ntoo, were completely sequenced. After conducting another\nround of assembly and assigning contigs and sequences to\ntaxonomic bins, we were able to assign 146,384 bp of unique\nsequence to Sulcia. In these data, we identified 166 protein-\ncoding genes. A phylogenetic analysis of a concatenated\nalignment of ribosomal proteins groups this protein set\nwithin the Bacteroidetes, thus supporting our assignment of\nthese sequences to Sulcia (Figure 5).\nAlthough theoretically we could obtain a complete genome\nsequence of Sulcia by very deep sequencing of the samples we\nhave obtained, this was not practical given limited funds.\nNevertheless, analysis of the incomplete genome is quite\nrevealing. First, among the 166 predicted proteins are 31 that\nunderlie steps or whole pathways for the synthesis of amino\nacids essential for the host (Figure 4). These include the\ncomplete pathway of threonine biosynthesis and nearly\ncomplete pathways for the synthesis of leucine, valine, and\nisoleucine (the only gene not sampled is ilvE encoding the\nbranched chain amino acid aminotransferase). In addition,\nmultiple genes in the pathways for the synthesis of lysine,\narginine, and tryptophan are present. We believe it is likely\nthat these pathways are present and that the missing genes\nare in the unsequenced parts of the genome.\nOne question that remains is where Sulcia gets all of the\nnitrogen for these amino acids. One possibility is that it\nacquires and then converts nitrogenous organic compounds,\nparticularly the nonessential amino acids known to be\npresent in xylem (e.g., [14,32]). Alternatively, it is possible\nthat Sulcia assimilates nitrogen from compounds such as\nureides or ammonium, which are found in xylem (e.g.,\n[14,32,34]). It has been proposed that X. fastidiosa, the plant\npathogen vectored by H. coagulata, makes use of the\nammonium in xylem as a nitrogen source [35]. Alternatively,\nSulcia could garner inorganic nitrogen from the host, for\nwhich ammonium is a waste product [10,13]. Host waste is\napparently is a source of nitrogen for Blattabacterium, close\nrelatives of Sulcia that are symbionts of cockroaches [36].\nAlthough some insect genomes encode enzymes that may\nallow for this (e.g., glutamine synthetase or glutamate\nsynthase (e.g., [37]), it is not yet known whether these\ncapabilities are present in sharpshooters. Whatever the\nsource of its nitrogen, the genome analysis indicates that\nSulcia apparently can make the amino acids required by the\nhost.\nThe other abundant organism in our DNA was Wolbachia,\nan unlikely candidate as the source of these compounds.\nWolbachia cannot be an obligate symbiont of sharpshooters\nbecause it infects only some individuals. Screening of\nindividual H. coagulata indicates that some do not contain\nWolbachia ([16], two of 40 insects were uninfected in our\nscreens); and screening of individuals of the closely related\nspecies, Homalodisca literata (a synonym of H. lacerta), revealed\nno cases of Wolbachia infection. Also, although we have\nsampled only a fraction of the Wolbachia genome, the absence\nof amino acid synthesis pathways is consistent with the\ncomplete lack of essential amino acid biosynthesis in any of\nseveral sequenced Wolbachia genomes (two complete and\nmany incomplete) [23,38,39].\nWe therefore conclude that Sulcia is most likely the sole\nprovider of essential amino acids for H. coagulata. Thus, this\nmember of the Bacteroidetes phylum appears to function in a\nsimilar way to Buchnera and Blochmannia species in the\nGammaproteobacteria.\nSulcia and Baumannia Complement Each Other\nWe found very few genes in the partial Sulcia genome for\nvitamin or cofactor synthesis. Since the Sulcia genome\nFigure 6.

Thus, in the 146 kb of sequence assigned\nto Sulcia, we have already found many of the core house-\nkeeping types of genes (e.g., 40 ribosomal proteins and ten\ntRNA synthetases (Figure 6, Table S2). A very small genome\nsize is consistent with phylogenetic reconstructions indicat-\ning that Sulcia is an extremely old symbiont, originating in the\nPermian [9].\nThe paucity of vitamin and cofactor synthesis pathways in\nSulcia suggests the possibility that Sulcia and Baumannia play\ncomplementary, nonoverlapping roles in this symbiotic\nsystem. Not only do they appear to provide different\nresources for the host (Sulcia provides the amino acids and\nBaumannia the vitamins and cofactors) but, based on the\ncurrent evidence, each does not provide the resources made\nby the other (Table 4). Indeed, the single essential amino acid\nbiosynthetic pathway present in the Baumannia genome, that\nfor histidine, is correspondingly the sole essential amino acid\npathway with multiple steps for which no genes were detected\nin Sulcia. Thus, although Baumannia and the host apparently\ndepend on Sulcia for the majority of essential amino acids,\nSulcia and the host may depend on Baumannia for histidine.\nThe complementarity between host and each symbiont\nextends to mutual dependence between the symbionts, which\nappear to depend on each other for these required\ncompounds and for intermediates in other metabolic\nprocesses. For example, we predict that Sulcia can make\nhomoserine, which, as discussed above, could be the substrate\nfor methionine synthesis in Baumannia. In addition, the valine\npathway in Sulcia could be the source of the 2-ketovaline for\npantothenate and coenzyme A biosynthesis in Baumannia.\nExchange of intermediates may be occurring for many\naspects of metabolism. In the case of ubiquinone, a key\ncomponent of the electron transport chain, Baumannia lacks\ngenes encoding the needed biosynthetic enzymes and thus\nlikely needs to import ubiquinone. The same appears to be\ntrue for menaquinone. Strikingly, even though only four of the\n166 proteins in Sulcia are predicted to be involved in pathways\nof cofactor synthesis, two are for production of menaquinone\nand ubiquinone production, which are among the few\ncofactors whose synthesis is not carried out by Baumannia.\nThe coresidence of Sulcia and Baumannia, presented here\nfrom H. coagulata, is representative of a symbiotic pair that is\ndistributed in most or all sharpshooters, a xylem-feeding\ninsect group [9,16]. Thus, the possibility of metabolic\ncomplementarity that is suggested by the genome analyses\nreflects long coevolution of the three lineages represented by\nthe insects and the two bacteria. The two symbionts occur in\nclose proximity within the yellow portion of the host\nbacteriomes [16], and Baumannia cells often appear to adhere\nto the surface of the much larger Sulcia cells. This arrange-\nment is illustrated in images from our in situ hybridizations\nfor H. literata, a close relative of H. coagulata (Figure 7).\nConclusions\nThe glassy-winged sharpshooter, H. coagulata, feeds on\nxylem sap, which has very low levels of many nutrients\nrequired by insects and other animals [10]. Sequence analysis\nsuggests the occurrence of an obligate symbiosis among three\norganisms: H. coagulata, the gamma-proteobacterial endo-\nsymbiont Baumannia, and the Bacteroidetes bacterial symbiont\nSulcia. The two bacterial symbionts co-occur within the\ncytosol of sharpshooter bacteriocytes, sometimes residing\nwithin the same cells. The main function of Baumannia, as\nrevealed by its genomic sequence, is to provide cofactors,\nespecially water-soluble B-family vitamins, to the host. Partial\nsequences from Sulcia suggest that it provides essential amino\nacids to the host. The two endosymbionts appear to show\nfunctional complementarity and show little overlap in\nbiosynthetic pathways, although full sequencing of the Sulcia\ngenome is needed for a comprehensive view of the\ncontributions of these two organisms. Our analysis shows\nthe added insight possible from assigning sequences to\norganisms rather than treating environmental samples as a\nrepresentative of a communal gene set.\nMany questions remain regarding this fusion of separate\nlineages into a single metabolic system. For example, the\ndifferent organisms must balance their contributions to the\nshared metabolism through coordinated growth and gene\nexpression, and the mechanisms underlying this integration\nare not known. Also, these bacterial genomes have undergone\nmajor reduction in size while apparently maintaining their\ncomplementary capabilities, raising the question of how the\nsteps in genome reduction have been coordinated. The\nsharpshooters and their obligate bacterial endosymbionts\nprovide a simple model of genomic coevolution, a process\nthat has likely been central in the evolution of most\norganisms living in stable associations.\nMaterials and Methods\nIsolation of DNA for sequencing. The material for sequencing was\nobtained from adults of H. coagulata collected in a lemon orchard in\nRiverside, California, in June 2001 and June 2004. The California\npopulation was introduced from southeastern United States, Texas,\nor Mexico within the past 20 years [10,27]. DNA was isolated by first\ndissecting out the red portion of the bacteriome, which contains\nmainly Baumannia [16]. Approximately 200 adults were dissected, in\nPA buffer, and kept on ice. Immediately following the dissection, the\nbacteriome samples were disrupted with a pestle and were passaged\nin PA buffer through a 20-lm filter and then through an 11-lm filter,\nFigure 7. Baumannia and Sulcia Coinhabit the Bacteriomes of the Host\nInsects\nFluorescent in situ hybridizations were performed using oligonucleotide\nprobes designed to hybridize selectively to the ribosomal RNA of\nBaumannia (green) and of Sulcia (red), respectively. Bacteriomes were\nobtained from Homalodisca literata (a very close relative of H. coagulata).\nDOI: 10.1371/journal.pbio.0040188.g007\nPLoS Biology | www.plosbiology.org\nJune 2006 | Volume 4 | Issue 6 | e188\nDual Symbiosis of Sharpshooters\n\non ice. The filtering was intended to remove nuclei of the host insect\ncells. DNA was isolated from the filtered material using standard\nmethods [16]. For the second sample, adults were collected in 2004\nfrom the same lemon orchard as before; in this case, we attempted to\nincrease representation of the Sulcia genome by dissecting out the\nyellow portion of the bacteriome from approximately 200 adults and\nthen processing as for the first sample.\nLibrary construction and shotgun sequencing. DNA libraries were\nconstructed by shearing the genomic DNA through nebulization,\ncutting DNA of a particular size out of an agarose gel, and cloning it\ninto the pHOS2 plasmid vector. Then 13,926 sequencing reads were\ngenerated from a 3- to 4-kb insert-sized library that was constructed\nusing the first ''red bacteriome'' DNA sample. In addition, a large\ninsert library (10- to 12-kb inserts) was constructed with DNA\npurified from the second ''yellow bacteriome'' DNA sample and 3,396\nreads were generated from this library. In order to get more\nsequences to close the Baumannia genome and finish Sulcia clones,\n2,986 sequencing reads were generated in the closure efforts.\nAssembly and closure of the Baumannia genome. The shotgun\nsequence data were assembled using the TIGR assembler [40], and the\ngenome of Baumannia was closed using a combination of primer\nwalking, multiplex PCR, and generation and sequencing of trans-\nposon-tagged libraries. Repeats were identified using RepeatFinder\n[41], and sequence and assembly of the repeats were confirmed using\nPCRs that spanned the repeat. The final assembly was checked such\nthat every single base is covered by at least two clones and has been\nsequenced at least once in each direction. The average depth of\ncoverage for the genome is 6.4. A putative origin of replication was\nidentified by analysis of transitions in oligonucleotide skew [42].\nIdentification and sequence of fragments of the genome of Sulcia.\nSequence reads from the shotgun sequencing data that did not map\nto the Baumannia genome were processed to sort them into candidate\ntaxonomic groups (bins). First, they were assembled into contigs\n(although the vast majority of sequences did not assemble). Then each\ncontig was analyzed to assign it to a putative bin using a combination\nof BLAST searches and phylogenetic trees. All sequences were\nsearched with BLASTN and BLASTX against multiple sequence\ndatabases to identify top scoring matches. In addition, the BLASTX\nsearch results were used to identify possible proteins encoded in the\nsequences; these proteins were then used to build phylogenetic trees.\nThe taxonomic identity of the nearest neighbor in these trees was\nextracted and stored. From these search results, sequences were\nassigned to taxonomic groupings of as low a taxonomic level as\npossible (e.g., if a protein grouped within a clade of sequences from\ninsects, it was assigned to an insect bin). Examination of the results\nrevealed that there were three major bins: insect, Wolbachia, and\nBacteroidetes. There were also many sequences that were not readily\nassignable to one of these bins but could be assigned to higher level\ngroups such as ''Bacteria.'' Based on rRNA studies and other work, we\nassumed that all sequences that were assigned to animals were likely\nfrom the host, and that all assigned to Bacteroidetes were likely from\nthe Sulcia symbiont. Thus we refer to these bins as host and Sulcia,\nrespectively.\nInitial analysis indicated that there were some genes encoding\nproteins predicted to be involved in amino acid synthesis in the Sulcia\nbin. In order to get more data from this taxonomic group, we decided\nto finish sequencing any clones that mapped to this group and that\nwere at the end of contigs. In order to reduce the probability of\nwasting funds sequencing clones from another organism, we\ndeveloped more stringent criteria for selecting which of the initial\nSulcia bin sequences to characterize further. In these criteria, at least\none of the following had to be true: (1) part of the contig contained a\nmatch of greater than 99% identity to the previously sequenced 16S\nto 23S rDNA of Sulcia [16]; (2) BLASTP searches of translated\nsequences against all complete microbial genomes gave a best match\n(based on E-value) to a member of the Bacteroidetes phylum; (3)\npredicted proteins branched with genes from Bacteroidetes species in\nneighbor joining trees; and (4) the sequences were significantly AT\nbiased. For all sequence reads that were assigned to Sulcia using these\ncriteria, if they were at the end of a contig, the remainder of the clone\nwas sequenced.\nAfter this additional sequencing, all sequence reads (including the\nnew reads) that did not map to the Baumannia genome were\nreassembled using the Celera Assembler. From this new assembly, a\n''final'' list of contigs likely to be from Sulcia was identified using\nsimilar criteria as above: first, the fragment had to have ORFs that\neither had a best scoring BLAST hit to a sequence in the Bacteroidetes\nphylum or position next to a Bacteroidetes gene in neighbor-joining\ntrees of the proteins identified by BLASTP. In addition, GC content\nhad to either be below 40% or the fragment had to have greater than\n99% match for at least 200 bases to the previously sequenced 16S\nrDNA of the Bacteroidetes endosymbiont of the H. coagulata. The low\nGC content criterion was applied to exclude contamination from\nfree-living bacteria in our DNA sample.\nFrom the new assemblies, contigs we also reassigned to the\nWolbachia and host bins. To be considered to be from Wolbachia, the\ncontig had to have not been assigned to Baumannia or Sulcia and had\nto have a top BLASTX hit to sequences from other Wolbachia. In total,\n43,079 bp of unique sequence were assigned to Wolbachia. Another\n120 kb worth of sequences and assemblies could not be assigned\nconclusively to Sulcia, Wolbachia, or Baumannia but had top BLAST hits\nto bacterial genes.\nGenome annotation. For the Baumannia genome, the GLIMMER\nprogram was used to identify putative CDSs [43]. Some putative CDSs\nwere discarded if they had no significant sequence similarity to\nknown genes and if they had significant overlaps with other CDSs\nwith significant sequence similarity to known genes. Noncoding RNAs\nwere identified as described previously [23]. Gene function annota-\ntion was based on results of BLASTP searches against Genpept and\ncompleted microbial genome and hidden Markov model searches of\nthe PFAM and TIGRFAM databases [44,45]. We identified only four\ngenes in the Baumannia genome that did not have BLASTP matches to\nany protein entries in Genpept or proteins from publicly available\ncomplete genomic sequences (using an E-value cutoff of 0.01). GC\nskew and nucleotide composition analysis were performed as\ndescribed previously [23].\nFor the partial Sulcia genome, ORFs were identified using the\nEMBOSS package [46]. Only those predicted peptides that were larger\nthan 45 amino acids in length and that had BLASTP hits against\nmicrobial genome databases at E-value cutoff of 0.001 were kept as\npotential genes. The functional annotation of the Sulcia genes is\nmostly based on the top BLASTP hits.\nDNA polymorphisms in Baumannia. Polymorphism analysis was\ndone on the results of the initial assemblies of the shotgun sequence\ndata. Finished sequences were not used since these were based on\npart on targeted sequencing of select clones, which eliminates the\nrandom nature found in the shotgun data. SNPs and indels were\nidentified using stringent criteria to identify regions with variation\namong sequence reads that were not likely due to sequencing errors.\nA site was considered to have an SNP if (1) it had high sequence\nquality (\"40 PHRED score); (2) the assembly column in which it was\nfound had more than 4-fold coverage; (3) it had differences among\nthe reads at that position, and (4) the variable site was adjacent to at\nleast three invariant positions on both sides. We used only positions\nthat did not have variable flanking sites to prevent alignment errors\nfrom mistakenly causing us to score a site as polymorphic. SNPs in\ncoding regions were characterized as synonymous (no amino acid\nchange), conservative (common amino acid change), nonconservative\n(unusual amino acid chance), or nonsense (stop codon), with a\nBLOSUM80 matrix being used to distinguish conservative from\nnonconservative.\nAlignment gaps were scored as INDELs only if (1) the column with\nthe gap had at least 4-fold coverage; (2) the aligned column had at\nleast two high-quality sequence reads (\"40 PHRED score), and (3)\nthree consecutive sequence reads on both sides of the gap(s) were of\nhigh quality (\"40 PHRED score).\nTo determine whether the polymorphisms occurred within or\nbetween individual host insects, DNA was extracted from the\nbacteriomes of 40 individual H. coagulata. These individuals were\nfrom the same collection that was used for the genomic sequences\nand had been frozen at #80 8C at the time of collection. PCR primers\nwere designed for two regions (554 bp and 725 bp) that contained\nSNPs. These regions were amplified, the reaction products cleaned\nwith Qiagen (Valencia, California, United States) miniprep columns,\nand the products were sequenced directly in both directions at the\nUniversity of Arizona Genomic Analysis and Technology Center\nusing an ABI 3730 sequencing machine.\nWe also used these 40 individuals to determine whether Wolbachia,\nwhich was detected in our sequence dataset, was present in all insects\nin the population. This determination was made on the basis of\ndiagnostic PCR based on two genes, 16S rRNA and wsp, with the\nBaumannia SNP loci described above used as controls for DNA quality.\nIndividuals with products for both Wolbachia loci were scored as\npositive, and individuals lacking both were scored as negative. (No\nindividuals yielded one product and not the other.)\nComparative genomics. The predicted proteomes of Baumannia,\nWigglesworthia, Blochmannia, and three strains of Buchnera were\ncombined into one database. ''All vs. all'' BLASTP searches were\nperformed for this database, and a Lek clustering algorithm was\napplied to cluster the peptides into gene families. An E-value cutoff\nPLoS Biology | www.plosbiology.org\nJune 2006 | Volume 4 | Issue 6 | e188\nDual Symbiosis of Sharpshooters\n\nof 1 3 10#4 for the BLASTP results and a Lek similarity cutoff of 0.6\nwere chosen for the gene family clustering [47]. All the genes were\nsearched against PFAM and the TIGRFAM database by HMMER, as\nwell as against the reference genomes of E. coli K12 and Yersinia pestis\nKIM by BLASTP. Gene families were curated and functional roles\nwere assigned according to the HMM and BLASTP search results.\nWhole genome alignments of Baumannia versus Wigglesworthia,\nBlochmannia, three strains of Buchnera, E. coli, and Yersinia pestis were\nperformed. Genome alignments were built using the BLASTP-based\nJava program DAGCHAINER [48] with an E-value cutoff of 1 3 10#5.\nPhylogenetic analysis. A set of 45 ribosomal protein genes for\nwhich orthologs could be identified in Baumannia and other genomes\nof interest was selected. Each ortholog set was aligned using\nCLUSTALW, the alignments were concatenated, a maximum like-\nlihood tree was built by PHYML, and 1,000 bootstrap replicates were\nperformed [49]. The same approach was adapted for building the\nmaximum likelihood tree from a set of 34 ribosomal protein genes\nfor Sulcia and selected genomes of interest.\nPathway analysis. The proteomes from Baumannia and Sulcia were\nsearched against KEGG GENES/SSDB/KO [50] databases by BLASTP.\nNeighbor-joining trees were built by QUICKTREE [51], and EC\nnumbers were assigned to the Baumannia proteins basing on the\nnearest neighbor in the phylogenetic trees. The list of the EC number\npresent in the Baumannia genome was submitted to the KEGG Web\nsite (http://www.genome.jp/kegg) to obtain all the potential pathways\nin the genome. Each pathway was examined and verified according to\nour genome annotations as well as the pathway descriptions in the\nEcoCyc database [52].\nFluorescent in situ hybridizations to visualize coresiding sym-\nbionts. In order to obtain images of the symbionts and to verify the\ncorrespondence of 16S rDNA sequences to the organisms inhabiting\nbacteriomes, these structures were dissected from newly collected H.\nliterata, a close relative of H. coagulata that occurs in Tucson, Arizona.\n(This procedure requires live material, and H. coagulata is a major pest\nthat is not yet established in Arizona where this work was carried out.)\nBacteriomes were disrupted in buffer, hybridized, and visualized as\ndescribed in [9], except that mounts were made in antifading\nVectashield medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, California,\nUnited States), and the microscope and software used were\nDeltavision RT and SofWoRx V2.50 Suite V1.0 and Imaris V4.0\n(Applied Precision, Issaquah, Washington, United States). The two\noligonucleotide probes were specific to the homologous regions of the\n16S rRNA and were labeled with different fluorescent dyes, enabling\nvisualization of both symbionts within the same preparations.\nSupporting Information\nTable S1.
