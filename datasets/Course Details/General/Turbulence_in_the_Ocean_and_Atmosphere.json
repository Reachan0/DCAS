      "content": "Homework assignment 1\nProblem 1\nThe problem of the onset of turbulence is an area of active research. In class we\nbriefly discussed the original model proposed by Landau and the more recent ideas of\nRuelle and Takens. The textbooks by Landau and Lifshitz and Tritton have chapters\non the two theories. The article \"Hydrodynamic Instabilities and the Transition to\nTurbulence,\" published by H.L. Swinney and J.P. Gollub in Physics Today (August\n1978) is another good review of the issue. Read this material (and whatever else\nyou might find useful) and summarize the differences between Landau's explanation\nversus the modern view of the onset of turbulence,. Discuss what is the observational\nevidence which supports one or the other explanation. Your answer should not exceed\na couple of pages.\nProblem 2\nConsider the cubic map,\nxn+1 = r xn(3 - 4x 2 ).\n(1)\nn\nThe parameter r plays the role of a Reynolds number in that it controls whether the\nsolutions are regular or erratic. The map is defined in the interval x ∈ [-1, 1] and\nr ∈ [0, 1].\nPart 1\nWrite a MATLAB program to draw the bifurcation diagram of the cubic map for\nr ∈ [0, 1]. How do the solutions change as r becomes larger? Is there a transition\nto a \"chaotic\" behavior? Does the bifurcation diagram look similar to the one of the\nlogistic map?\nPart 2\nConsider the cubic map with r = 1. Select a set of different initial conditions x0\nand plot the PDF of this set, i.e. the P (x0). Now integrate the map for this set of\ninitial conditions, and plot the PDF after n iterations, i.e. the P (xn). Repeat this\nexercise for different values of r in the range [0, 1]. Do the PDFs asymptote some\nsimple distribution? How do the PDFs change as a function of r?\n\nProblem 3\nLet x be a Gaussian variable. First show that all odd moments of x are zero. Then\nshow that all even moments are related to the variance σ2 = (x - x )2 and write what\nis the relationship. In particular write the skewness and the kurtosis of a Gaussian\nvariable.\nProblem 4\nThe logistic map presents the same closure problem encountered in turbulence. The\nequation for any moment of x depends on higher order moments and cannot be solved\nwithout additional information on these higher order moments. Consider for example\nthe equation for the ensemble average of x,\nx n+1 = r x n - rxn\n2 ,\n(2)\nwhere the overbar denotes the ensemble average. The equation for the first moment,\nx , depends on the second moment x2 . Derive the equation for the second moment\nand shows that it depends on moments higher than second.\nMost methods of closing the hierarchy of moments make assumptions about the rela\ntionship of (n+1)-th order moments to n-th order moments. A typical approach is to\nassume that the statistics of x are Gaussian and use the results of problem 3 to relate\nall moments to the second. Apply this method to close the equation for the second\nmoment. With this assumption, the equation for the first and second moment form\na closed set. Use MATLAB to iterate the two equations for r = 4. What happens?\nCan you explain why this approach fails [Hint: you might want to go back to Lecture\n2 and remind yourself of what is the stationary distribution for the logistic map]?"

      "content": "Convection probleh set\n1. Hele-Shaw Cell Convection\nThe Hele-Shaw cell has a thin layer of fluid confined between two glass or plexiglass\nplates at y = 0 and y = 6. It allows us to study real analogues to 2-D flows.\n1)Assume that u and w have the characteristic parabolic profile in y\nand that pressure and buoyancy are independent of y and v = 0. Take the y average of\nthe scaled equatione\nD\n\n--u = - U p + R a b i + ~ ~ u\nPr Dt\nv . u = e\n(b being the deviation from 5 = z ) . Show that the averaged momentum equation reduces\nwhen 6 is very small (thin fluid layer) and the R.ayleigh number is big.\n2) Define the streanlfunction and the y-component of the vorticity. Eliminate the\npressure and write coupled equations for II, and b.\n333 Solve the linear stability problem and find the critical R.ayleigh number assuming\nfree-slip conditions on top and bottom,\n4) 8onsider now the iloillinear problem. We could solve for weakly supercritical con-\nditions by assuming t e Ru - Rag is small and expanding in suitable powers. However, it\nis easier to follow Loreilz and examine a truilcated systems. Derive the equivalents to the\nLoreilz equatioils for this system. You can use the same expansions for b and the vorticity\nas in the notes.

Line P l u m\nA line plume is driven by a steady buoyancy flux per unit length Go (units of m3sp3)\non a line which extends infinitely far in one horizontal direction y. The resultant plume is\ntherefore 2-dimensional, with no variation in the y-direction. Entraiilment into the plume\noccurs only in the x-direction. I11 this problem, we'll examine the derivation of the plume\nequations and the solutions.\n1$Let the turbulent plume extend from r ( z ) < x < r(z).

      "content": "Homework assignment 3\nProblem 1. Tracer spectra.\nGlenn showed that the eddy kinetic energy spectrum for homogeneous isotropic tur\nbulence in two dimensions has different slopes in the direct and inverse cascade ranges.\nCan you derive the spectral slopes for a passive tracer advected by the two dimensional\nturbulent flow? Assume that you are in the inertial-convective regime (i.e. molecular\nfriction and diffusion do not matter), but discuss separately the tracer spectrum for\nthe direct and inverse cascade regimes. Tennekes and Lumley's book and Vallis' one\nare good references for this problem.\nProblem 2. Rotational constraints on 3D turbulence.\nOver most of the ocean N/f > 1, so that turbulence is more likely to be influenced by\nstratification than by rotation. However, in regions where N ≈ 0, such as the surface\nmixed layer, rotation may constrain unstratified turbulence. Assuming that rotation\nconstrains the turbulent motions when the Rossby number U/fL < 1, where U is the\nvelocity scale, and L the length scale, find the length scale ` above which rotation\naffects the turbulence. Assume for L < ` the turbulent motions are in the inertial\nrange of the Kolmogorov spectrum.\nProblem 3. Transformed Eulerian Mean.\nThis problem shows how eddies can drive a mean advection with skew eddy fluxes.\nLet us consider small-amplitude (linear), quasi-geostrophic, Rossby waves in a β\nchannel 0 < y < L, semi-infinite in the vertical, forced by a zonal mean flow over\nsmall amplitude topography h0(x, y) centered on z = 0. The bottom boundary is an\nimpermeable surface at z = h0(x, y),\nh0(x, y) = H0 cos(kx) sin(ly),\n(1)\nwhere l = πy/L. The basic state of the fluid is Boussinesq, with uniform stratification\nN 2 and a spatially uniform westerly flow U; there is no dissipation.\nThe linearized QGPV equation is,\n∂tq0 + U∂xq0 + v0∂yQ = 0,\n(2)\nwhere the mean PV gradient is ∂yQ = β. The relation between QGPV and the\n\nstreamfunction ψ is,\nf 2\nq0 = ∂x\n2ψ0 + ∂y\n2ψ0 + N\n2 ∂z\n2ψ0.\n(3)\nThe boundary condition of no-normal flow is,\nw0|z=0 = ∂th0 + (u0 + U)∂xh0 + v0∂yh0.\n(4)\n1. Show that the linearized boundary condition at z = 0 is,\nw0|z=0 = U∂xh0.\n(5)\n2. Solve for ψ0, that is find solutions to the linear QGPV equation that satisfy\nthe boundary condition. Show that these solutions are vertically propagating\nRossby waves.\n3. Using your solution for ψ0, write the corresponding expressions for u0, v0, w0,\nand b0. Draw schematics of these variables as a function of x and z.\n4. Compute the Eliassen-Palm fluxes for these waves, that is compute the zonal\naverages of the momentum and buoyancy fluxes, u0v0, v0b0, where,\nZ 2π/k\n() =\n()dx.\n(6)\nShow that there is an horizontal buoyancy flux, i.e. a an eddy flux along mean\ndensity contours (in QG density contours are to leading order horizontal).\n5. Compute the residual velocities v+ and w+. Show that there is a non-zero eddy-\ninduced vertical velocity. [Hint: the mean velocity w is not zero.]\n6. Explain why this problem is an example of the non-acceleration theorem."

      "content": "Chapter 1\nIntroduction\nRichard Feynman (1964) in his Lecture on Physics observed that,\nOften, people, in some unjustified fear of physics, say you can't write an\nequation for life. Well, perhaps we can. As a matter of fact, we very\npossibly already have the equation to a sufficient approximation, when we\nwrite the equation for quantum mechanics:\n∂ψ\nHψ = -\n.\n(1.1)\ni ∂t\nHowever, we are unable to reconstruct the field of biology from this equa\ntion, and we depend on detailed observation of biological phenomena.\nUriel Frisch (1995) in his book Turbulence points out that an analogous situation\nprevails in the study of turbulent flows. The equation, generally referred to as the\nNavier-Stokes equation, has been know since Navier (1827) and Stokes (1845),\nDu\n= -\n∇p + ν∇2 u,\n(1.2)\nDt\nρ0\n∇· u = 0,\n(1.3)\nThe Navier-Stokes equations probably contain all of turbulence. Yet it would be\nfoolish to try to guess from these equations all the variety of regimes of turbulent\nflows without looking at experimental facts. The phenomena are almost as varied as\nin the realm of life. The flows shown in Fig. 1 are example of solutions of the Navier-\nStokes equations, with modifications to account for rotation and density variations.\nBut nobody knows how to derive these solutions from the equations themselves.\nA good way to make contact with the world of turbulence phenomena is through\nobservations of natural flows. Examples are ubiquitous in the ocean, atmosphere,\nh\n\nFigure 1.1: Examples of turbulent flows at the surface of the Sun, in the Earth's\natmosphere, in the Gulf Stream at the ocean surface, and in a volcanic eruption.\nlakes, and rivers of our Earth, in the atmospheres of other planes, in stars, galaxies,\nand space gases (neutral and ionized). A few examples are shown in Fig. 1. These\nflows are very irregular and do not display the regularity of the solutions of the Navier-\nStokes equations that you studied in introductory courses in fluid dynamics. The field\nof turbulence can be defined as the attempt to bring together our understanding of\nthe laws that govern fluid dynamics (the Navier-Stokes equations) with the irregular\nnature of real flows.\nBut how can we tell which natural flows are turbulent and which are not? As for the\nproblem of defining life, there is no simple answer. A useful approach is to list what\nproperties must be present to consider a flow turbulent.\n1.1\nProperties of turbulent flows\n- Broadband spectrum in space and time\nTurbulent flows are characterized by structures on a broad range of spatial and\ntemporal scales, even given smooth or periodic initial conditions and forcing.\nThat is turbulent flows have a broadband spectrum both in frequency and\nwavenumber domains.\n\nFigure removed due to copyright restrictions.\nCitation: Van Dyke, Milton.

ISBN: 9780915760039.\nFigure 1.2: High Re jet exiting from a nozzle.\n\nFigure removed due to copyright restrictions.\nCitation: Van Dyke, Milton. An album of fluid motion. Stanford,\nCA: Parabolic Press, 1982, p. 176. ISBN: 9780915760039.\nFigure 1.3: Uniform flow incident on a cylinder at low Re. Uniform flow incident on\ntwo cylinders at high Re.\nIf L is the length scale of the largest motions and l is the length scale of the\nsmallest motions in a flow, then a large range of spatial scales implies L ≫ l. The\nscale l is typically the scale at which dissipation becomes important and removes\nenergy from the flow. The scale L, instead, is set by the forcing mechanisms\nthat set the large-scale flow. The ratio L/l is the Reynolds number Re, and\nL ≫ l implies that the Reynolds number be large. Turbulent flows have large\nReynolds numbers (Fig. 1.2 and 1.3).\n- Dominated by advective nonlinearity\nA field of non-interacting linear internal waves with many different frequencies\nand wavenumbers can also have a large range of length scales, but it is not\nturbulent. Why not? In a turbulent flow the different scales interact, through\nthe nonlinear terms in the equations of motion. And these nonlinear interactions\nare responsible for the presence of structure on many different scales. Thus the\nbroad band spectrum appears as a result of the internal dynamics. In a field of\nlinear internal waves, instead, the broad band spectrum is generated by external\ncontrols like forcing, initial or boundary conditions (Fig. 1.4).\n- Unpredictable in space and time\nTurbulent flows are predictable for only short times and short distances. Even\nthough we know the equations that govern the evolution of the fluid, we cannot\nmake predictions about the details of the flow due to its sensitive dependence\non initial and boundary conditions. This sensitive dependence is once more\na result of the strong nonlinearity of the flow. Predictability, however, can be\nrecovered in a statistical sense, as we will see in lecture 2 (Fig. 1.5). The sensitive\ndependence on initial and boundary conditions is a fundamental property of\nchaotic systems. Are thus turbulence and chaos synonyms? No. Turbulent\nmotions are indeed chaotic, but chaotic motions need not be turbulent. Chaos\nmay involve only a small number of degrees of freedom, i.e. it can be narrow\nband in space and/or time. There are numerous examples of chaotic systems\ncharacterized by temporal complexity, but spatial simplicity, like the Lorenz's\nsystem. Another class of chaotic flows is represented by amplitude equations\n\nFigure removed due to copyright restrictions.\nFigure 1.4: These internal wave photographs were taken by astronauts on board the\nspace shuttle on Jan. 14, 1986. The picture shows the sea surface of the Eastern\nPacific, around the Galapagos Islands, 600 miles off the coast of Ecuador. The sea\nsurface coverage of a photograph is about of 75 km by 75 km. There is a clear\ndifference between the wavy patterns of internal waves and the turbulent patterns of\nclouds.\n\nthat describe the slow time and large scale evolution of nearly monochromatic\nwaves. Turbulence is different, because it is always complex both in space and\ntime.\n- Time irreversible\nTurbulent motions are not time reversible. As time goes on, turbulent motions\ntend to forget their initial conditions and reach some equilibrated state. Turbu\nlence mixes stuff up, it does not unmix it (Fig. 1.6). A challenge of this course\nwill be to explain how irreversibility can arise in fluids that are governed by\nclassical mechanics, i.e. Newton's dynamics, which is time reversible.\nThe classification of properties that a flow must display to be considered turbulent\nis a subject of continuous debate in the scientific community. Many authors make\nnarrower definitions of turbulence, limiting the scope to\n- flows exhibiting explosive three dimensional vortex stretching\n- flows obeying Kolmogorov's cascade law (to be described later)\n- flows with a finite cascade of energy toward smaller scales.\nThese definitions are arbitrarily exclusive, since there are many geophysical flows\nwhich share the fundamental properties of broadband spectrum, advective nonlinear\nity, unpredictability, and time irreversibility, yet, due to the effects of rotation and\nstratification, are not fully three dimensional, do not satisfy Kolmogorov's law, and\nhave no energy transfer toward smaller scales.\nThe properties of turbulent flows are better described in terms of dualities between\nregular and turbulent flows. Here we follow a list proposed by Jim McWilliams, a\nvery influential oceanographer from UCLA.\n- Deterministic vs random.\nThe equation of motions are deterministic, but their solutions have many at\ntributes of random processes.\n- Orderly versus chaotic.\nMany of the spatial and temporal patterns are orderly, but the overall behavior\nis clearly chaotic.\n- Time reversible versus time irreversible.\nIf we neglect ν and κ (because Re is large), then the equations are time re\nversible, i.e. any solutions for (t, u, p, b) is also a solution for (-t, -u, p, b), but\nthe outcome is evidently irreversible, even after a short period of time of the\norder of the eddy turnover time, L/U. The breaking of symmetries is a salient\nfeature of turbulent motions.\n\nFigure removed due to copyright restrictions.\nCitation: Uriel, Frisch. Turbulence.

The circles on plots for 30 April, 1, 6, and 7 May are the location where\ntracer values representative of vortex air where measured aboard the ER-2 aircraft.\nThere is good agreement between the location of the filaments of ex-vortex air in the\nsimulation and the locations where vortex air was observed (See Waugh et al., 1997\nfor details). The tracer tends to spread out from the location where it was released.\n- Materially confined versus dispersive.\nParcels initially close to each other, tend to spread in time. Turbulence mixes\ntracers, it doesn't unmix them.\n- Conservative versus non-conservative.\nIf we neglect ν and κ, then the equations are conservative (of energy, tracer\nvariance, etc.), but the outcome of turbulence is dissipative (the second law of\nthermodynamics applies). If dissipation continues to occur in a regime with only\nlarge-scale forcing or initial conditions - as is true for the Earth's climate system\n- then there must be a continuing transfer of fluid properties from larger spatial\nscales to smaller ones, and eventually small enough so that diffusive terms can\nbe comparable to the advective ones. This process is called the forward (i.e.\ntoward smaller scales) turbulent cascade.\n- Quasi-periodic and spatially smooth versus broad-band.\nTurbulence develops a broad spectrum in (ω, k) space even when given smooth\nor periodic initial conditions or forcing. The spectra of atmospheric and oceanic\nflows can show some indication of preferred time and spatial scales, but have\nbroad-band shape (examples: atmospheric near-surface wind frequency spec\ntrum and oceanic internal wave frequency spectrum). Spectra often have power-\nlaw forms over wide frequency and wavenumber ranges (e.g. the famous k-5/3\nform of the Kolmogorov cascade in three-dimensional turbulence and the ω-5\n\nfrequency spectrum for surface waves in the open ocean).\n- Predictable versus unpredictable. A turbulent flow is predictable for only a\nlimited period of time, usually of the order of several eddy turnover times,\nL/U. On the other hand statistical properties of the flow can be quite stable,\nhence in principle predictable. This situation is reminiscent of thermodynamics:\nif we put two bodies of different temperatures in contact we can predict their\nfinal temperature, but not the trajectory of every single molecule.\n- Smooth versus sensitive dependence.\nThe evolution of the partial differential equations of fluid dynamics is ill-posed\nin the classical sense, in that small changes in any aspect of the problem for\nmulation (initial conditions, boundary conditions, model parameters, etc.) lead\nto large macroscopic changes in the solution after a finite time, the so-called\npredictability time.\n- Statistically regular versus statistically irregular.\nSome statistical measures of turbulence have nearly Gaussian probability distri\nbutions, but the overall structure of turbulent fields is highly non-Gaussian with\nrare and intense events relatively more probable (i.e. turbulence has bursts).\n- Globally ordered versus locally ordered.\nGlobal ordering is rare for large Re, unless it is established through ordered\nforcing or domain geometry. But local ordering, particularly of the vorticity\nfield, is nearly universal. This local ordering is the coherent structures.\n- Persistent versus transient, evanescent, chaotically recurrent patterns.\nThe evident ordering in the flow patterns is usually transient. Coherent struc\ntures appear and disappear in an unpredictable sequence.\nIn real turbulent flows neither pair of the antonyms is entirely false. However much\nof our understanding of turbulence lies in comprehending how flows transitions from\none member of the antonym to the other.\n1.2\nGoverning equations\nWe will take a simplified form of the governing equations for use in this course,\nviz., the Boussinesq equations. The ocean and the atmosphere have a more complex\nthermodynamics than these equations do, but this is largely extraneous to the fun\ndamental behaviors of turbulence and thus will be ignored. The three dimensional\n\nBoussinesq system is,\n\n∂u\n+ (u · ∇)u = -\n∇p + ν∇2 u + bzˆ\n-fzˆ × u ,\n(1.4)\n∂t\n\nρ0\n\ninertia\nfriction\nbuoyancy\nCoriolis\n\n∂b\n\n+ (u · ∇)b = κ∇2b ,\n(1.5)\n∂t\n\nadvection\ndiffusion\n\n∂c\n\n+ (u · ∇)c = κ∇c ,\n(1.6)\n∂t\n\nadvection\ndiffusion\n∇· u = 0,\n(1.7)\nwhere p is the pressure, f is the Coriolis frequency associated with planetary rotation,\nand the vertical versor zˆ is assumed to be parallel to both gravity and the axis of\nrotation. The buoyancy b is defined in terms of density as ρ = ρ0(1 -g-1b). Notice\nthat b has the dimension of an acceleration. These equations must be complemented\nby forcing, boundary and initial conditions to obtain a well posed problem. We can\nalso consider the evolution of a passive tracer c: it satisfies the same equation as b,\nbut it has no influence on the evolution of u. [The Boussinesq equations follow from\nthe full Navier-Stokes equations if one neglects all density fluctuations except those\ndue to heat, salt, and humidity].\nThese equations have conservative integral invariants for energy, and all powers and\nother functionals of buoyancy, in the absence of friction and diffusion. For non-\nconservative dynamics, the energy and scalar variance satisfy the equations,\n∂E\n∂B\n= -ε,\n= -εB ,\n(1.8)\n∂t\n∂t\nwhere,\n\n[E, B, ε, εB] =\ndx\nu · u -bz, b2, ν ∇u : ∇u + κz∇2b, κ ∇b · ∇b ,\n(1.9)\nIn deriving (1.8), it is assumed that there are no boundary fluxes of energy or scalar\nvariance. These integrals measures of the flow can only decrease with time through\nthe action of molecular viscosity and diffusivity. The only exception is the compressive\nwork, κz∇2b, which can act as a source of mechanical energy. We will return to this\nissue in the chapter on convection.\nEvery problem we will consider lies within the set of solutions of the PDE system in\n(1.4) through (1.7). No general solution is known, nor is any in prospect, because\nwe do not know a mathematical methodology that seems powerful enough. However\ncomputers are giving us access to progressively better particular solutions, i.e. with\nprogressively larger Re.\n\nThe brackets in (1.4) through (1.5) contain the effects of buoyancy and rotation, and\nthese terms are ignored in the classical literature on turbulence, which deals with\nuniform density fluids in inertial reference frames. In these simpler circumstances,\nthe Boussinesq system is called the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, or with\nthe further elimination of the frictional term, the incompressible Euler equations.\nBecause of the lack of general solutions to the Boussinesq equations, it is useful to\nidentify which terms might be neglected in specific situations in order to simplify the\nproblem and make analytical progress. The relative size of the various terms that\nappear in (1.4) through (1.7) can be estimated in terms of nondimensional numbers.\nThe ones that will be most useful in this class are as follows.\n- Inertia and friction\nThe Reynolds number is defined as\nUL\nRe ≡\n(1.10)\nν\nHere U and L are characteristic velocity and length scales of the flow and ν is\nthe kinematic viscosity of the fluid. The Reynolds number measures the ratio\nof inertia and friction,\n|(u · ∇)u|\nU/L U\n|ν∇2u|\n≈νU/L2 = Re.\n(1.11)\nEquivalently, the Reynolds number is the ratio of the characteristic scale of the\nflow L and the scale at which momentum is dissipated l = ν/U. In turbulent\nflows Re ≫1, advective dominance ⇒nonlinear dynamics ⇒chaotic evolution\nand broadband spectrum.\nThe focus of this course is on turbulence in the Earth's ocean and atmosphere.\nTypical values for ν near the Earth's surface are 1.5 × 10-5 m2 s-1 for air\nand 1.0 × 10-6 m2 s-1 for water. These values are small enough, given typical\nvelocities U, that Re ≫1 on all spatial scales L from the finescale of about\n1 m to the planetary scale of about 104 km. For example, U = 1 m s-1 and\nL = 103 m give Re = 109 -1010 respectively for the atmosphere and the ocean.\nFor Re ≫1, the frictional term is small, at least at the scale L. Paradoxically,\nhowever, the dissipation terms in (1.8) control the energetics of the system.\nThus, there must be a profound difference in solutions between the asymptotic\ntendency as Re →inf, and the Euler limit, Re = infor ν = 0. The difference\nis that as long as Re ≤inf, there are small scales at which friction becomes\nimportant and Re is small.\nIt is instructive to check how Re controls the behavior of solutions in a real flow.\nLet us consider a fluid of uniform density in an inertial reference system, i.e. let\n\nFigure 1.7: Uniform flow with velocity U, incident on a cylinder of diameter L.\nus neglect rotation and variations in buoyancy in (1.4) and (1.5) (b = f = 0). A\nclassical example is a uniform flow incident on a cylinder (figure 1.7). Figures\n1.8 through 1.10 show how the flow past the cylinder changes for different\nReynolds numbers. And the movie by Wim de Leeuw at Re = 22000 gives you\nthe feeling of how complex is the flow that develops behind the obstacle (run\ndns-midi.mpg).\n- Advection and diffusion\nUL\nPe ≡\n(1.12)\nκ\nThe Peclet number is the direct analog of Re for a conserved tracer c with a\ndiffusivity κ and measures the relative importance of advection and diffusion.\nAt large Pe, the tracer evolution is dominated by advection. Once more, the\nlimit Pe →infis very different from Pe = inf, because dissipation, no matter\nhow small, eventually is responsible for removing structure from the tracer field\n(Fig. 1.11).\n- Friction and diffusion\nν\nPr ≡\n(1.13)\nκ\nThe frictional length scale is lν = ν/U and the diffusive length scale lκ = κ/U.\nThe Prandtl number is defined as the ratio of these two length scales, Pr ≡\nUniform flow.\nFigure by MIT OCW.\n\nFigure removed due to copyright restrictions.\nCitation: Van Dyke, Milton.

The Prandtl number is a property of the fluid, not of the particular flow.\nHence there is a restriction on the transfer of information from experiments\nwith one fluid to those with another. For Pr > 1 the scales at which friction\nbecomes important are larger than those for diffusion and, at some small scale,\nwe expect to find smooth velocity fields together with convoluted tracer fields.\nFor Pr < 1 we expect the opposite. The Prandtl numbers for air and water are\n0.7 and 12.2 respectively. The paper by Paparella and Young (Journal of Fluid\nMechanics, 2002) shows examples of flows with low and high Pr.\n- Inertia and Coriolis\nU\nRo ≡\n(1.14)\nfL\nThe Rossby number Ro measures the relative importance of the real inertial\nforces and the fictitious Coriolis force, that appear because of the rotating ref\nerence system.

A useful parameter to characterize the flow in these\nproblems is the ratio of the buoyancy timescale tb = (L/∆b)1/2 = 1/(∂b/∂z)1/2\nand the inertial timescale due to horizontal shears in the flow ti = L/U =\n1/(∂u/∂z). This ratio is called the gradient Richardson number Ri. If Ri ≪\n1, buoyancy can be neglected in the momentum equations, and it becomes a\npassive scalar with no feedbacks on the dynamics (Fig. 1.14).\nA final remark about the only term that never appeared explicitly in the nondimen\nsional numbers presented: the pressure force. Pressure can be formally eliminated\nfrom the equations. This is a consequence of the Boussinesq approximation. We\nsimply need to take the divergence of the momentum equation in (1.4) and note that\n∇· ut = 0 because of incompressibility.

      "content": "Chapter 2\nFrom laminar to turbulent flows\nTurbulent flows can often be observed to arise from laminar flows as the Reynolds\nnumber is increased1 . The transition to tubulence happens because small disturbances\nto the flow are no longer damped by the flow, but begin to grow by taking energy from\nthe original laminar flow. This natural process is easily visualized by watching the\nsimple stream of water from a faucet (or even a pitcher). Turn the flow on very slow\n(or pour) so the stream is very smooth initially, at least near the outlet. Now slowly\nopen the faucet (or pour faster) and observe what happens, first far away, then closer\nto the spout. The surface begins to exhibit waves or ripples which appear to grow\ndownstream. In fact, they are growing by extracting energy from the primary flow.\nEventually they grow enough that the flow breaks into drops. These are capillary\ninstabilities arising from surface tension, but regardless of the type of instability, the\nidea is the same -infinitesimal disturbances have grown to disrupt the simplicity of\nthe laminar flow. In this lecture we investigate how this transition from laminar to\nturbulent dynamics occurs.\nLaminar flows are solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations in the limit when nonlin\nearities can be neglected. This situation corresponds to the Stokes approximation;\nthe flow is given by a balance between external forcing (mechanical or thermodynam\nical) and dissipation. The corresponding velocity field is entirely predictable and has\nthe same regularity properties as the applied external forces.\nAs the Reynolds number is increased, nonlinearities are no longer negligible. There\nis a critical Reynolds number, above which the system bifurcates toward completely\nnew solutions. These solutions correspond to breaking of symmetries of the origi\nnal flow. For example a steady flow submitted to time independent forcing becomes\ntime periodic. Usually the state resulting from a first bifurcation is still very regular.\n1In this lecture Reynolds number is used to identify whatever nondimensional number is appro\npriate to characterize the onset of turbulence in the problem at hand.\n\nX\nX\nWhen the Reynolds number is increased even further, the flow that emerged after the\nprimary bifurcation can itself become unstable to new modes breaking new symme\ntries. The set of bifurcation continues until the global dynamics of the flow becomes\nvery complicated, i.e. turbulent.\nThe transition from simple to complex behavior is observed in models as simple as\ndeterministic maps. Thus in the next section we derive a map based on a loose anal\nogy to the Navier-Stokes equation. A study of solutions of the map will provide an\nintroduction to the problem of the onset of complexity and chaos in simple deter\nministic systems. These results will provide an introduction to the problem of onset\nof turbulence. How can irregular and apparently stochastic solutions appear in fluid\nflows that are governed by deterministic equations?\n2.1\nThe logistic map as a poor man's Navier-Stokes\nequation\nFollowing Frisch we introduce a discrete map that mimics some of the properties of\nthe Navier-Stokes equations. A sort of a poor man's Navier-Stokes equation. We\nbegin with the incompressible form of the NavierStokes equations,\nu + F ,\n(2.1)\nut + u · ru = -rp + Re-1r2\nr · u = 0.\n(2.2)\nWe now express the sloutions in terms of the Fourier representation of u,\nu(x, t) =\nai(t)e ik·x .\n(2.3)\ni\nThis resulting infinite system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for the Fourier\ncoefficients is known as a Galerkin projection of the Navier-Stokes equations; e.g.,\na i = -\nAijkaj ak - Re-1|k|2 ai + Fi.\n(2.4)\njk\nEquation (2.4) is simple to understand. Every mode ai represents a component of\nthe velocity field with a lengthscale |k|. The velocity field at each lengthscale can\nbe changed through nonlinear interaction with other modes, through linear damping\nor through forcing Fi. The nonlinear interaction are quadratic and their strength is\ncontrolled by the coefficients Aijk. Damping is inversely proportional to the length-\nscale and thus it is more efficient for small-scale modes. A detailed derivation of\nequation (2.4) is given in chapter 3 of Salmon's book.\nIn order to keep the problem simple let us remove all but a single arbitrary wave\nmode. This procedure is called a Galerkin truncation. This results in an equation of\n\n!\n\nthe form,\na = -Aa2 - Re-1|k|2 a,\n(2.5)\ni.e. an evolution equation for one mode forced by a quadratic nonlinearity and damp\ning. This derivation is not formally correct. A careful expansion of the Navier-Stokes\nequation would show that a mode cannot interact nonlinearly with itself. In other\nwords Aiii = 0. We ignore the issue for the moment. The only justification for\nequation (2.5) is that it has a quadratic nonlinearity and dissipation, much alike\nthe Navier-Stokes equation and it might be a useful paradigm to study the onset of\ncomplex behavior in a simple deterministic system.\nIt is straightforward to solve (2.5) numerically. Here we will employ a simple forward\nEuler single-step, explicit time integration procedure. This leads to,\nan+1\nτ\n- an = -Aa2\nn - Re-1|k|2 an,\n(2.6)\nwhere τ is an arbitrary discrete time step parameter. We now rearrange the equation\nas,\nan+1 = τAan\n1 - Re-1τ|k|2\n- an .\n(2.7)\nτA\nThis map can be reduced to a well studied example, if we require,\n1 - Re-1τ|k|2\n= 1,\n(2.8)\nτA\nwhich implies that,\nτA = 1 - Re-1τ|k|2 .\n(2.9)\nThis in turn permits us to write (2.6) as,\nan+1 = 4 1 - Re-1τ |k|2 an(1 - an) = ran(1 - an),\n(2.10)\nwhich is the well known logistic map.\nIt is easily seen that as Re →inf, r\n1 from below. Since a(1 - a) has a maximum\n→\nat 1/4 for a ∈ [0.1] we see that we should rescale r by a factor of 4 to obtain that the\nrange of values for r is is between zero and four, just as in the logistic map. It is also\nworth observing that r depends on the wavevector magnitude, and on the numerical\ntime step parameter. In particular, we see that the product of these factors must be\nless than Re in order for r > 0 to hold. This implies that as the wavevector magnitude\nincreases, the time step size must decrease, just as would certainly be the case in order\nto maintain stability of an explicit time-stepping method such as forward Euler.\n\nWe will show that the logistic map displays broadband spectrum in time, nonlinearity,\nunpredictable behavior, and time reversibility. However it is derived assuming a single\nlengthscale and it cannot display any spatial structure. Thus the logistic map is poor\nman's Navier-Stokes equation and cannot display turbulent behavior. However it is a\nuseful tool to study how a deterministic system can produce chaos and unpredictable\nbehavior.\n2.1.1\nLinear solutions of the logistic map\nWe start by studying linear solutions of the logistic map. The variable an represents\nthe amplitude of the velocity at time nτ. For convenience we will now switch from\nan to xn to indicate the mode amplitude. The logistic map is a one dimensional map\nof the form xn+1 = F (xn),\nxn+1 = rxn(1 - xn).\n(2.11)\nThe iteration of one dimensional maps is easy to see graphically: if we plot y = F (x)\nand y = x, the iterations are given by successive steps between these two curves,\ny = F (xn),\nxn=1 = y.\n(2.12)\nSuccessive iterations from a given initial values are given by successive operations of\nthe map F , an operation known as functional composition,\nx1 = F (x0),\n(2.13)\nx2 = F (x1) = F (F (x0)),\n(2.14)\n. . .\n(2.15)\nxn = F (xn-1) = F (F . . . F (x0)).\n(2.16)\nWe use the matlab function cobweb.m to study the properties of the map. The\nintersection xf of y = F (x) with y = x is a fixed point of the iteration, if,\nF (xf ) = xf .\n(2.17)\nWe can easily answer the question of whether an initial condition close to xf ap\nproaches the fixed point under iteration (when we call the fixed point stable) or\nmoves away from it (unstable fixed point) by linearizing the evolution about xf :\nwrite x = xf + δx and then using a Taylor expansion with F 0(x) the derivative of the\nfunction,\nxn+1 = xf + δxn+1 = F (xf + δxn) ≈ F (xf ) + δxnF 0(xf )\n(2.18)\nso that\nδxn+1 = F 0(xf )δxn\n(2.19)\n\nand |δxn| will increase on successive iterations for F 0(xf ) > 1. Thus the fixed point\nis stable for F 0(xf ) < 1 and is unstable for F 0(xf ) > 1. This procedure is the map\nequivalent of the linear stability analysis of solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations.\nIn 12.803 we considered the linear stability analysis of shear flows. In that case we\nconsidered the stability as a function of external parameters like the shear and its\ncurvature. Here we will study the stability of fixed points for different Reynolds\nnumbers.\n2.1.2\nBifurcations and the onset of chaos in the logistic map\nIn the logistic map for small values of r there is only one stable fixed point xf and\nalmost all initial conditions lead to an orbit that converges to the fixed point (x = 0\nand x = 1 being exceptional initial conditions). These solutions correspond to the\nlaminar flows at small Reynolds numbers. Nonlinearities are subdominant. However\nthings change as we increase r. What happens when xf becomes unstable (which\nhappens at r = 3)?\nThe first bifurcation\nAs the map parameter r is changed, the character of the long time solution dramat\nically changes, from a fixed point to a time dependent solution. These changes are\ncalled bifurcations. For values of r slightly larger then 3, the solution converges to an\norbit which alternately visits two values x1 and x2: this is the discrete time version of\na limit cycle or periodic orbit (here period two). The second iterate function y = F 2\nyields three intersections with the line y = x. It is easy to check that at two of\nthese the magnitude of the slope |dF 2/dx| is less than unity, i.e. there are two stable\nfixed points of F 2, and these correspond to x1 and x2. The third fixed point of F 2 is\nunstable: xf is of course an unstable fixed point of F . These issues are illustrated by\nthe matlab functions cobweb.m and logistic fp.m. Try to run them using r = 3.2.\nThe second bifurcation\nSet r to r = 3.5 and look at the iterations of F . The period two orbit has gone\nunstable, and the trajectory converges to a period four orbit. We have seen that the\nperiod two orbit is simple (a fixed point!) in F 2 . We can understand the second\nbifurcation by studying the fixed points of F 4 . The instability of the period two orbit\nis seen to be associated with the slope of F 4 becoming greater than unity, and again\ntwo new fixed points of F 4 develop.\nFurther bifurcations\nThe analysis of bifurcations gets more and more awkward as r increases. Hence we\nswitch to numberical exploration. But keep in mind that numerics can find attractors\n\nbut miss the unstable structures. With r slightly bigger than 3.54, the population\nwill oscillate between 8 values, then 16, 32, etc. The lengths of the parameter inter\nvals which yield the same number of oscillations decrease rapidly; the ratio between\nthe lengths of two successive such bifurcation intervals approaches the Feigenbaum\nconstant,\nδ = lim rn - rn-1 = 4.669 . . .\n(2.20)\nn→inf rn+1 - rn\nAll of these behaviors do not depend on the initial population. This is the so-called\nperiod-doubling bifurcation.\nThe bifurcations that occur, and the different types of orbits, are well shown by\nthe bifurcation map. This is constructed with the parameter r along the abscissa,\nand all values of x visited (after some numbers of iterations to eliminate transients)\nplotted as points along the ordinate. A fixed point orbit over a range of r appears\nas a single curve, which splits into two curves at the bifurcation to the period two\norbit etc. Chaotic dynamics, where the orbit visits an infinite number of points\n(otherwise the orbit would repeat, and therefore be periodic) appears as bands of\ncontinua of points (subject to limitations of how many points are actually plotted in\nthe implementation).\nThe bifurcation diagram of the logistic map shows that simple systems can have an\namazingly rich bifurcation structure. This complexity in the logistic map was first\nstudied by May in the context of population dynamics. You can create a bifurcation\nmap with the matlab function logistic bif.m.\nThe onset of chaos\nAt r = 3.569946 . . . the orbits become very irregular and we can no longer see any\noscillations. Slight variations in the initial population yield dramatically different\nresults over time. These are signatures that the orbits have become cahotic. Notice,\nhowever, that periodic windows mysteriously appear here and there as we further\nincrease r. These are sometimes called islands of stability. The largest window is\nnear (3.8284, 3.8415) where there is a period three orbit. For slightly higher values of\nr oscillations flicker between 6 values, then 12 etc. There are other ranges which yield\noscillation between 5 values etc.; all oscillation periods do occur. These behaviours\nare again independent of the initial value.\nAt r = 4, the large admissible value for r, the map is fully chaotic. The iterations\nappear completely random, and the values eventually fill up the whole interval [0, 1].\nThis chaotic motion can be completely understood by making a transformation of\nvariables. Define,\nxn = sin2(πzn/2).\n(2.21)\n\nFigure 2.1: The complete orbit diagram, which is the plot of the map's attractor as\na function of r. This amazing diagram is as beautiful as it is mysterious. If you look\nat it more closely, you will find that lying just above the periodic windows in the\nchaotic region are small copies of the whole orbit diagram. Thus this picture has fine\nstructures at arbitrarily small scales.\nFigure removed due to copyright restrictions.\n\n(\n\nThe iteration of z for r = 4 is then just,\nzn+1 =\n2zn,\n0 ≤ zn ≤ 1/2\n(2.22)\n2 - 2zn,\n1/2 ≤ zn ≤ 1\nThis is known as the tent map. Successive values of zn from a random initial value are\nas random as a coin toss (and in fact in binary representation answering the question of\nwhether the n-th value is to the right or left of 0.5 just gives the binary representation\nof the initial value, which is random for a random initial value). Beyond r = 4, the\nvalues eventually leave the interval [0, 1] and diverge for almost all initial values.\nIt is interesting to consider the temporal spectrum of orbits of the logistic map for\ndifferent values of r. At the appearance of the period two orbit, the spectrum has a\nsingle peak at f = 1/2. As r increases, period doubling bifurcations generate new\npeaks at sub-harmonics f/2, f/4 and so on. Notice that the appearance of sub-\nharmonics is quite different from the appearance of super-harmonics (2f, 4f, . . .)\nas a result of quadratic nonlinearities. Finally, at the onset of chaos the number of\nexcited harmonics becomes large and the spectrum appears to be broadband.\n2.2\nChaos and sensitivity to initial conditions\nThe orbits of the logistic map become very erratic when r = 4. But what do we mean\nby the orbits being chaotic? The onset of chaos is defined by a \"sensitive dependence\non initial conditions\", i.e. orbits with similar initial conditions diverge exponentially\nfast. The sensitive dependence on initial conditions can be made quantitative by\ngeneralizing the idea of instability of a fixed point. Equation (2.19) can in fact be\nused for the expansion of a small separation at any xn,\nδxn+1 = F 0(xn)δxn,\n(2.23)\nso that the product of the derivatives at successive iterations gives us the expansion\n(or contraction) of the separation between the iterates of nearby points.\nMore precisely we start with initial conditions x0 and x0 +Δx and ask for the distance\nbetween the n-th iterates, which we expect to grow as,\n|δxn| = Δxe nλ(x0) ,\n(2.24)\nwhere λ(x0) is the so-called Lyapunov exponent for the initial condition x0, i.e.\nF n(x0 + Δx) - F n(x0)\nΔx\n=\ndF n(x0)\ndx0\n.\n(2.25)\nλ(x0) = lim lim\nlog\nn→inf\nlim\nlog\nΔx\n0 n\nn→inf n\n→\nFor systems like the logistic map for r = 4 the limit exists and is independent of the\ninitial condition x0 for almost all initial conditions (e.g. not those points exactly on\n\nunstable periodic orbits), and will be denoted λ and called the Lyapunov exponent\nof the map. The derivative can be evaluated by the chain rule in terms of derivatives\nof F at the intermediate iterations,\ndF n(x0) = F 0(xn-1)F 0(xn-2) . . . F 0(x1)F 0(x0).\n(2.26)\ndx0\nThus we can compactly write,\nλ = hlog |F 0|i,\n(2.27)\nwhere the average h i is over the iterations of the map. A positive value of λ corre\nsponds to the difference between closely spaced initial conditions growing (on average\nexponentially) with iteration i.e. to sensitive dependence on initial conditions. Thus\na positive Lyapunov exponent is a signature of chaos, and may be used as a defining\ncriterion. The Lyapunov exponents of the logistic map are shown as a function of r in\nfigure 2.2. Positive values of λ appear forlarger values of r. The occasional negative\ndips correspond to the islands of stability.\nr\nλ\nComments\n0 - 0.005112 . . .\nstart stable fixed point\n-0.003518...\nstart stable 2-cycle\n3.449489743... -0.003150...\nstart stable 4-cycle\n3.56994571869 +0.001934...\nstart of chaos (Dewdney, 1988)\n3.828427125... -0.003860...\nstart stable 3-cycle\n3.9\n+0.7095...\nback into chaos\n+0.6931...\nend of chaos\n(2.28)\n2.3\nRoutes to chaos\nThe logistic map is a useful example to study the onset of chaos in a deterministic\nsystem as a function of an external parameter like the Reynolds number r. The\nquestion arises as to whether the bifurcation patterns that leads to the onset of chaos\nis typical of other systems, or whether it is an oddity of the logistic map. For the\nmoment we restrict the discussion to maps and low order dynamical systems (i.e.\nsystems described by a small number of ordinary differential equations). We will\nextend the discussion to turbulent flows at the end of the lecture.\nDespite the richness and complexity in the orbits generated by maps and dynamical\nsystems, it turns out that the routes to chaos are quite universal and can be broadly\ngrouped in three classes: the period doubling route, the intermittency route, and the\nquasi-peridoc route. The logistic map is an example of a map that follows the first\nroute.\n\nFigure 2.2: The bifurcation diagram together with the corresponding Lyapunov ex\nponents for the logistic map.\nFigure removed due to copyright restrictions.\n\nPeriod doubling route (Feigenbaum, 1978)\nThe system loses stability through period-doubling, pitchfork bifurcations. The sys\ntem undergoes a cascade of such period-doublings until at the accumulation point\none observes aperiodic behaviour, but no broad-band spectrum. Note also, that if\none has seen three bifurcations, a fourth bifurcation becomes more probable than a\nthird after only two, etc. This route to chaotic behavior has been observed in heat\ntransport by convection.\nIntermittency route (Pomeau & Maneville, 1980)\nThe system loses stability through intermittency, i.e. chaos appears intermittently\nwithin an otherwise regular trajectory. There are no clear cut precursors for this route\nalthough it is characterized by long periods of periodic motion with bursts of chaos.\nThe logistic map shows transition to chaos through intermittency for r = 3.8282 just\nbelow the period three window. Intermittent behavior generally happens close to a\nsaddle-node bifurcation.\nQuasi-periodic route (Ruelle & Takens, 1971)\nIn this route to chaos, there are a number of periodic orbits with irrationally related\nfrequencies that lead to chaos. The system loses stabilty through Hopf bifurcations.\nAssume that a system with a steady state solution loses its stability, as some control\nparameter is varied, through a Hopf bifurcation (ie. a pair of complex eigenvalues\ncrosses the imaginary axis). The steady state becomes oscillatory. Assume that\nthis happens three times in succession and that the three newly created modes are\nessentially independent - then chaos may occur. The precursor is the existence of\nquasi-periodic motions.\nThe power spectrum will exhibit one, then two, and possibly three independent ba\nsic frequencies. When the third frequency is about to appear simultaneously some\nbroad-band noise will appear - this is then regarded as chaotic. Evidence is from\nTaylor-Couette vortices in fluid flow between rotating cylinders and in Rayleigh-Bnard\nconvection.\n2.4\nA statistical description of chaos\nThe previous examples suggest that trajectories of maps and dynamical systems are\npredictable when orbits are fixed points or periodic oscillations. After the onset of\nchaos, instead, there seem to be little hope to predict the details of the trajecto\nries. This situation is similar to what happens in the study of fluid flows. When the\nReynolds number is small, solutions are linear and predictable. At large Reynolds\n\n0.5\nxn\nn\nFigure 2.3: Intermittency route to chaos in the logistic map for r = 3.8282. Part of\nthe orbit looks like a stable period three cycle, as indicated by the blue circles. But\nthis is spooky since the period three orbit no longer exists! We are seeing the ghost\nof the three cycle.\n\n(\nnumbers, the flow becomes erratic and exact solutions cannot be found neither an\nalytically, nor numerically. Does it mean that a theory of turbulence is beyond our\nreach?\nLet us consider the logistic map with r = 4, in the strongly chaotic regime. The\nmap displays broadband spectrum in time, nonlinearity, unpredictable behavior, and\ntime irreversibility (Fig. 2.4). However the histogram of the positions x assumed by\nthe orbit is quite predictable (Fig. 2.4). In the chaotic regime the histograms show a\npredictability that does not emerge in individual trajectories. The histogram always\nconverge toward the same distribution, regardless of initial conditions. Why does\nthe histogram of the logistic map converge to a limit solution? Why a deterministic\nsystem such as a map has a regular statistical behavior? We do not have complete\nanswers to these equations, but progress is being made. The current understanding\nis that maps in the chaotic regime collapse on a strange attractor which is a gener\nalization of the fixed points and periodic orbits in the linear regime. The structure\nof strange attractors is very complex. That is why trajectories are so erratic and\ndifficult to predict. However ensemble of trajectories reflects the mean structure of\nthe attractor and can be predicted.\nIn this section we derive a statistical description of the logistic map. The goal is to un\nderstand the difference between the trajectory-based description and the histogram-\nbased description. First we need to determine the evolution equation for the histogram\nP (v), also known as the probability distribution function, so that we can observe the\nrecurrence relation Pn+1(v) = UPn(v). The distribution function Pn+1(v) after n + 1\niterations is obtained by the action of the operator U on Pn(v), which is the distri\nbution function after n iteration of the map. The operator U acts on functions and\nit is known as the Perron-Frobenius operator.\nWe can derive the Perron-Frobenius operator for the logistic map. We have already\nshown that by making the change of variables,\nxn = sin2(πzn/2),\n(2.29)\nthe logistic map with r = 4 becomes,\nzn+1 =\n2zn,\n0 ≤ zn ≤ 1/2\n(2.30)\n2 - 2zn,\n1/2 ≤ zn ≤ 1\nwhich is known as the tent map, because of the shape of its graph. We can easily\nwrite the Perron-Frobenius operator for the tent map,\n\nv\nv\nPn+1(v) =\nPn\n+ Pn 1 -\n.\n(2.31)\nAs a consequence of the form of the Perron-Frobenius operator, if Pn is constant\nequal to P0, then Pn+1 is also equal to P0. The uniform distribution P = P0 is\n\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\nxn\nn\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\nHistogram\nx\nFigure 2.4: A trajectory and the histogram for the logistic map with r = 4.\n\nthe equilibrium distribution. The uniform distribution is indeed the final state that\none obtains by running numerical integrations of the tent map. Thus the statistical\ndescription predicts a result that cannot be derived from simple inspection of the\ndeterministic equation.\nHow do we know that the equilibrium distribution is obtained for any set of initial\nconditions? In order to solve arbitrary initial value problems, we need the full set of\neigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the Perron-Frobenius operator. These eigenfunc\ntions can be used to represent any arbitrary initial condition. The eigenfunctions for\nthe tent map belong to a family of polynomials called the Bernoulli polynomials. The\neigenfunctions are found by solving the problem,\nP (v) = λ UP (v).\n(2.32)\nIn the example of the tent map, we find that the all eigenfunctions but the uniform\ndistribution have λ ≤ 1. For example an eigenfunction is given by,\nP (v) = v 2 - 2v + .\n(2.33)\nThis eigenfunction has an eigenvalues λ = 1/4. The uniform distribution P = 1 is\nthe only eigenfunction with eigenvalue λ = 1. Thus all eigenfunctions other than\nthe uniform distribution decay in time. And the uniform distribution emerges as the\nasymptotic state.\nIt is left as an exercise to relate the probability distribution of the tent map to that\nof the poor man's Navier-Stokes map, and show that it correctly predicts what we\nfound by numerical integrations of the map.\n2.5\nTurbulence and chaos\nIt is finally time to go back to fluid dynamics and try to relate the lessons of chaotic\nmaps to the description of turbulence.\n2.5.1\nTransition to turbulence\nLessons from the dynamical system approach\nUp to the discovery of chaos in simple deterministic systems, studies on the onset\nof turbulence dealt with linear and, very rarely, with weakly non-linear evolution of\nexternal disturbances. The first physical model of laminar-turbulent transition is due\nto Landau and it is reported in the fourth volume of the course on Theoretical Physics\n\n(Landau and Lifshitz, 1971). According to this model, as the Reynolds number is\nincreased, the system undergoes a infinite series of Hopf bifurcations. Each bifurcation\ncauses the velocity field to oscillate with a new frequency fi, until for sufficiently large\ni the motion appears chaotic. In this picture the unpredictability of turbulence arises\nbecause each new frequency fi is associated with a new phase φi and, for large i, it\nbecomes progressively difficult to keep track of all oscillations.\nThe Landau transition scenario is, however, untenable because a few incommensu\nrate frequencies do not generate positive Lyapunov exponents. And the sensitive\ndependence on initial conditions is a trademark of turbulent flows. This character\nistic feature is now known as the butterfly effect. Thus the transition to turbulence\nis probably best understood in terms of the routes to chaos observed in maps and\nsimple dynamical systems.\nShortcomings of the dynamical system approach\nShould we then conclude that the onset of turbulence is analogous to the onset of\nchaos? Unfortunately the story is more complicated. Dynamical systems arise from\nthe projections of the full Navier-Stokes dynamics on a very limited number of spatial\nscales. The onset of chaos in those system is then forced to remain confined to few\nspatial scales. Experiments suggest that the onset of turbulence in real flows is\nassociated with broadband spectra both in time and in space. It is very difficult to\nset up experiments where there is transition to chaos with the appearance broadband\nspectrum in time, without an increase in the number of the spatial degrees of freedom.\nOnly by carefully designing experiments in closed environments, can one observe the\nroutes to chaos described above in real flows. For the moment, we must conclude that\nthe theory of dynamical systems and chaos provides useful insights in the world of\nturbulence, but it is not the whole story. We will return to this issue in the discussion\nof turbulent convection.\n2.5.2\nStatistical description of turbulence\nThe logistic map is a useful tool to illustrate some important characteristics of tur\nbulent flows. However it is pathological in at least two ways,\n- The logistic map explores the full available space [0, 1]. Typically turbulent sys\ntems are dissipative and collapse on an attractor with fractal structure (at least\nfor finite-dimensional systems). This limitation can be overcome considering\ntwo dimensional maps.\n- Natural systems tend to have more than one attractor. Thus the equilibrium\nstatistical properties are not fully predictable.\n\nFurthermore there are technical issues that have not been solved for the Navier-\nStokes equations. We do not know if solutions exist for all times for arbitrary initial\ncondition. We do not know how to write the equivalent of the Perron-Frobenius\noperator.\nFurther reading:\nFrisch, chapter 1-3\nStrogatz, chapter 10\nTritton, chapter 24"

      "content": "Chapter 3\nA statistical description of\nturbulence\nThe evolution of turbulent flows is very complex. Turbulent flows appear highly dis\norganized with structure at all scales. Signals appear unpredictable in their detailed\nbehavior. However some statistical properties of the flow can be quite reproducible.\nThis suggests that it can be useful to seek a statistical description of turbulent flows.\nA statistical measure is an average of some kind: over the symmetry coordinates,\nif any are available (e.g, a time average for stationary flows); over multiple realiza\ntions (e.g, an ensemble); or over the phase space of solutions if the dynamics are\nhomogeneous.\nIn lecture 2 we have shown that a similar behavior is observed in simple deterministic\nmaps. These maps are chaotic and not predictable in their detailed properties, but\ntheir statistical properties are reproducible, just like for turbulent flows.\nThus it seems quite appropriate to introduce a probabilistic description of turbulence.\nHowever we know that the basic Boussinesq equations are deterministic. How can\nchance and chaos arise in a purely deterministic context? A nice discussion of this\nissue can be found, in chapter 3 of Frisch's book.\nIn this lecture we first introduce the statistical tools used in the analysis of turbulent\nflows. Then we show how to apply these tools to the study of turbulence.\n3.1\nProbability density functions and moments\nA complete description of a turbulent variable v at a given location and instant in\ntime is given by the probability density function (PDF), P (v), where P (v)dv is\n\nthe probability of the variable v taking a value between v and v + dv, and\n+inf\nP(v)dv = 1.\n(3.1)\n-inf\nThe PDF can be estimated by constructing a histogram of an ensemble of measure\nments of v at the specified location, repeating the experiment time and time again.\nThe larger the ensemble (i.e. the more times the experiment is repeated), the more\nclosely the histogram will approximate the PDF.\nThe moments of the variable v are derived from the PDF. The n-th moment < vm >\nis defined as\n+inf\n< vn >=\nv nP(v)dv\n(3.2)\n-inf\nThe first moment < v > is the mean:\n+inf\n< v >=\nvP(v)dv\n(3.3)\n-inf\nThe variance is the second moment of the perturbation quantity v′ = v- < v >,\nand describes the level of variability about this mean.\n+inf\n< v′2 >=\n(v-< v >)2P(v)dv\n(3.4)\n-inf\nThe skewness is the third moment of v′, normalized by the variance:\n< v′3 >\nskewness = < v′2 >3/2\n(3.5)\nA PDF which is symmetric about the mean < v > will have zero skewness. All higher\nodd moments of such a symmetric PDF will also be identically zero. The skewness\nreveals information about the asymmetry of the PDF. Positive skewness indicates\nthat the PDF has a longer tail for v -⟨v⟩> 0 than for v -⟨v⟩< 0. Hence a positive\nskewness means that variable v′ is more likely to take on large positive values than\nlarge negative values. A time series with long stretches of small negative values and\na few instances of large positive values, with zero time mean, has positive skewness\n(Fig. 3.1).\nThe kurtosis (or flatness) is the fourth moment of v′, normalized by the variance:\n< v′4 >\nkurtosis = < v′2 >2\n(3.6)\nA PDF with longer tails will have a larger kurtosis than a PDF with narrower tails.\nA time series with most measurements clustered around the mean has low kurtosis,\na time series dominated by intermittent extreme events has high kurtosis (Fig. 3.2).\n\nFigure 3.1: Signal with a positive skewness.\nThe characteristic function Pˆ(k) is the Fourier transform of the PDF,\n+inf\nPˆ(k) =\ne ikvP(v)dv =< eikv > .\n(3.7)\n-inf\nThe characteristic function of the sum of two independent variables is the product of\ntheir individual characteristic functions.\nIf we take the derivative of the above equation with respect to k and evaluate it at\nthe origin (k = 0) we see that the n-th moment is related to the derivatives of the\ncharacteristic function by,\ndnPˆ(k)\n\nn\n\n= in < v >,\n(3.8)\ndkn\n\nk=0\n√\nwhere i =\n-1.

Therefore, it is necessary to define joint probability density functions\n(JPDF). For example the JPDF PJ (u, v) of variables u and v is the probability of\nfinding the first random variable between u and u + du, and the second one between\nv and v + dv. The integral of PJ over the u,v two-dimensional space is unity by\ndefinition,\ninf\ninf\nPJ (u, v) du dv = 1,\n(3.10)\n-inf\nand PJ (u, v) is positive definite. We recover the PDF of u by integrating PJ over all\nvalues of v, and the PDF of v by integrating over all values of u,\ninf\ninf\nP (u) =\nPJ (u, v) dv,\nP (v) =\nPJ (u, v) du.\n(3.11)\n-inf\n-inf\nThe moments of u and v can therefore be obtained from PJ as well. The joint first\nmoment of u and v, ⟨uv⟩, is defined as,\ninf\ninf\n⟨uv⟩ =\nuv PJ (u, v) du dv.\n(3.12)\n-inf -inf\nThe covariance of u and v is defined as,\nC(u, v) = ⟨uv⟩-⟨u⟩⟨v⟩ = ⟨u ′ v ′⟩.\n(3.13)\nThe covariance of u and v normalized by the rms values of u and v (the square roots\nof their variances) is called the correlation function r(u, v) and is used to quantify\nthe degree of correlation between u and v,\n⟨u′v′⟩\nr(u, v) =\n\n.\n(3.14)\n⟨u′2⟩\n⟨v′2⟩\nFor perfectly correlated variables, the correlation function is ±1. The covariance is a\nmeasure of the asymmetry of the JPDF.\nTwo variables whose covariance is zero, or equivalently whose correlation is zero,\nare said to be uncorrelated. Notice that two uncorrelated variables need not to be\nindependent. Statistical independence of two variables requires that the JPDF can\nbe expressed as the product of the individual PDFs,\nPJ (u, v) = P (u)P (v).\n(3.15)\nThus independent variables are uncorrelated, but the reverse is not true.\n\nThese concepts can be extended to three or more variables, but it is rarely the case\nthat one has enough information about the statistics of a flow to measure quantities\nlike PJ (u, v, w).\nWhile PDFs and JPDFs are fundamental to theories of turbulence, one seldom mea\nsures or use such quantities. Most often, only the first and the second moments are\nused to characterize the turbulent flow. Particular importance is given to covariances,\nwhich appear in the problem of Reynolds averaging and will be discussed at the end\nof this lecture.\n3.3\nErgodicity and statistical symmetries\nComputing ensemble means is a daunting task when dealing with laboratory experi\nments or numerical simulations, because it requires to repeat experiments or numerical\nruns over and over. In the case of geophysical flows, the situations is even worse; we\ncannot ask nature to repeat weather patterns in order to compute our means. Does\nit mean that a statistical description of turbulence is a nice theoretical idea with\nno practical relevance? Fortunately not, because we can estimate ensemble means\nthrough time and spatial means, under certain assumptions.\n- Stationarity\nTurbulence is stationary if all mean quantities (e.g. < v >, < vn > etc) are\ninvariant under a translation in time. A stationary variable v is ergodic if the\ntime average of v converges to the mean < v > as the time interval extends to\ninfinity,\nT\nv(t)dt =< v > as T →inf.\n(3.16)\nT\n(See Frisch, 4.4 for a detailed discussion of ergodicity). In this case a time\naverage is equivalent to an ensemble average.\n- Homogeneity\nTurbulence is homogeneous if all the mean quantities are invariant under any\nspatial translation. Then an ergodic hypothesis allows an ensemble average to\nbe calculated as a spatial average,\nL\nv(x)dx =< v > as L →inf.\n(3.17)\nL 0\n- Isotropy\nTurbulence is isotropic if all the mean quantities are invariant under any ar\nbitrary rotation of coordinates.\n\n- Axisymmetry\nTurbulence is axisymmetric if all the mean quantities are invariant under a\nrotation about one particular axis only (e.g. the z axis for stratified turbulence).\nStationary, isotropic, homogeneous statistics are frequently assumed in theories of\nturbulence, but are in fact rare in geophysical contexts where stratification and Cori\nolis break the symmetry with respect to rotation, boundaries break the symmetry\nwith respect to translation, and seasonal and diurnal forcing break the symmetry\nwith respect to time-shifts. However less restrictive assumptions, to be described in\nthe rest of this class, allow progress to be made.\n3.4\nCentral Limit Theorem\nMany quantities in turbulence can be thought of as a sum of random variables. For\nexample a net particle displacement in a turbulent flow may be thought as the sum\nof N random displacements by small eddies; a net velocity may be thought as the\nsum of N random velocity increments. If we assume the incremental changes xn all\nhave the same unknown PDF and zero mean value, then the net change in variable\nis given by,\nN\nz =\nxn.\n(3.18)\nn=1\nIf all the individual incremental changes are independent and uncorrelated with PDF\nP(x), the variance of z is given by,\nN\nN\n< z2 >=\n< xnxm >= Nσ2 ,\n(3.19)\nn=1 m=1\nwhere σ2 is the variance of all the xn. (Notice that we are assuming that σ2 is finite.\nThis is not always the case as for example for power-law PDFs).\nThe variance of z increases with the size of the ensemble N. As it turns out, it is\nmore convenient to work in terms of the variable u = N-1/2z, which has variance σ2\nfor all N. We can now determine the PDF of u.\nThe characteristic function of P(u) is given by\nn=1\nPˆu(k) =< eiku >= ⟨e ik/N1/2 N\nxn ⟩ = (Pˆ(kN-1/2))N .\n(3.20)\nWe can expand Pˆ(kN-1/2) as shown in (3.9),\nk2σ2\nPˆ(kN-1/2) = 1 -\n+ O(k3N-3/2).\n(3.21)\n2N\n\nFor large N we obtain the characteristic function of the sum:\nPˆu(k) = lim (1 - k2σ2/2N)N = e -k2σ2/2 .\n(3.22)\nN→inf\nThe corresponding PDF is\n-u2/2σ2\nP(u) =\ne\n,\n(3.23)\n(2πσ2)1/2\ni.e. a Gaussian PDF. Therefore the sum of a large number of identically distributed\nindependent variables has a Gaussian PDF, regardless of the shape of the PDF of the\nvariables themselves. This result is known as the central limit theorem.\n√\nThe sum, normalized by 1/\nN, of N random, independent and identically\ndistributed variables of zero mean and finite variance, σ2 , is a random\nvariable with a PDF converging to a Gaussian distribution with variance\nσ2 .\nIt is important to remember the conditions under which this statement holds: the\nindividual variables must be independent; N must be large; the variance σ2 of the\nPDFs of the individual variables must be finite.\nThe central limit theorem is most useful as a starting point, because deviations from\nGaussian PDFs indicate that some of the assumptions discussed above are broken.\nThis happens often in turbulent flows.\n3.5\nIntermittency\nA signal is said to be intermittent if rare events of large magnitude are separated by\nlong periods with events of low magnitude. Spatial intermittency implies that the\nsignal displays localized regions with events of large magnitude, and wide areas with\nevents of low magnitude. PDFs of intermittent flows are not Gaussian. If turbulence\nis dominated by coherent structures localized in space and time, then PDFs are not\nGaussian. Flows characterized by intermittency are not self-similar.\n(Further reading: Tennekes and Lumley, Ch 6; Lesieur, Ch 5; Frisch, Ch 3, Ch 4, and\nCh 8 for more on intermittency).\n3.6\nThe Closure Problem\nAlthough it is impossible to predict the detailed motion of each eddy in a turbulent\nflow, the mean state may not be changing. For example, consider the weather sys\n\ntem, in which the storms, anti-cyclones, hurricanes, fronts etc. constitute the eddies.\nAlthough we cannot predict these very well, we certainly have some skill at predict\ning their mean state, the climate. For example, we know that next summer will be\nwarmer than next winter, and that in California summer will be drier than winter.\nWe know that next year it will be colder in Canada than in Mexico, although there\nmight be an occasional day when this is not so. We would obviously like to be able\nto predict the mean climate without necessarily trying to predict or even simulate\nall the eddies. We might like to know what the climate will be like one hundred\nyears from now, without trying to know what the weather will be like on February\n9, 2056, plainly an impossible task. Even though we know what equations determine\nthe system, this task proves to be very difficult because the equations are nonlinear.\nThis is the same problem we discussed at the beginning of the lecture. We seek a\nstatistical description of the turbulent flow, because a detailed description is beyond\nour grasp. The simplest statistical quantity we might try to predict is the mean\nflow. However, because of the nonlinearities in the equations, we come up against the\nclosure problem.\nThe program is to first decompose the velocity field into mean and fluctuating com\nponents,\nu = u + u ′ .\n(3.24)\nHere u is the mean velocity field, and u′ is the deviation from that mean. The mean\nmay be a time average, in which case u is a function only of space and not time.\nIt might be a time mean over a finite period (e.g a season if we are dealing with\nthe weather). Most generally it is an ensemble mean. Note that the average of the\ndeviation is, by definition, zero; that is u′ = 0. We then substitute into the momentum\nequation and try to obtain a closed equation for u. To visualize the problem most\nsimply, we carry out this program for a model nonlinear system proposed by Geoff\nVallis\n\nwhich\n\nobeys,\n\ndu\ndt + uu + νu = 0.\n(3.25)\nThe average of this equation is,\nd u\ndt + uu + ν u = 0.\n(3.26)\nThe value of the term uu is not deducible simply by knowing u , since it involves\ncorrelations between eddy quantities u′u′. That is, uu = uu + u′u′ =\n\nuu . We can go\nto next order to try to obtain a value for uu. First multiply (3.25) by u to obtain an\nequation for u2 , and then average it to yield,\n1 duu + uuu + νuu = 0.\n(3.27)\ndt\nThis equation contains the undetermined cubic term uuu. An equation determining\nthis would contain a quartic term, and so on in an unclosed hierarchy. Most current\n(http://www.princeton.edu/~gkv/aofd.pdf)\n\nmethods of closing the hierarchy make assumptions about the relationship of (n+1)-th\norder terms to n-th order terms, for example by supposing that,\nuuuu = uu uu -αuuu,\n(3.28)\nwhere α is some parameter. Such assumptions require additional, and sometimes\ndubious, reasoning. Nobody has been able to close the system without introducing\nphysical assumptions not directly deducible from the equations of motion.\n3.7\nThe Reynolds equations\nLet us repeat the averaging procedure for the full Boussinesq equations. We start\nwith the momentum equations,\n∂u\n+ (u · ∇)u + fzˆ × u = bzˆ -\n∇p + ν∇2 u -(u′ · ∇)u′ ,\n(3.29)\n∂t\nρ0\nThe extra term on the right hand side represent the effect of eddy motions on the\nmean flow. If the average operator is a time average over some time T , then eddy\nmotions are those motions with time scales shorter than T . If the average operator is\na spatial average over some scale L, then eddy motions are those motions with spatial\nscales shorter than L. If the average operator is an ensemble mean, then the eddy\nmotions are those motions that change in every realizations, regardless of their scale,\ni.e. they represent the unpredictable or turbulent part of the flow.\nUsing the continuity equation,\n∇· u = 0\n⇒\n∇·\n\nu = 0 and ∇· u ′ = 0,\n(3.30)\nwe can rewrite the averaged momentum equation as,\n∂u\n+ (u · ∇)u + fzˆ × u = bzˆ -\n∇· p I -ρ0ν∇u + ρ0u′u′ .\n(3.31)\n∂t\nρ0\nI is th unit matrix. These are the so-called Reynolds momentum equation and\nthe eddy flux ρ0u′u′ represent the Reynolds stress tensor due to fluctuations in\nvelocity filed.\nWe can similarly decompose the buoyancy equation into a mean and a fluctuating\ncomponent, b = b +b′, and write an equation for the mean component by substituting\nback into the buoyancy equation,\n∂ b\n\n+ (u · ∇) b = -∇· -κ∇ b + u′b′ .\n(3.32)\n∂t\n\nThe eddy term u′b′ represent the Reynolds eddy flux of buoyancy.\nThe problem of turbulence is often that of finding a representation of such Reynolds\nstress and flux terms in terms of mean flow quantities. However, it is not at all clear\nthat a general solution (or parameterization) exists, short of computing the terms\nexplicitly.\n3.8\nEddy viscosity and eddy diffusivity\nThe simplest closure for the Reynolds stress terms is one which relates u′u′ to the\nmean flow, by assuming a relation of the form,\nu′u′ = -νT ∇u ,\n(3.33)\nwhere νT is the eddy viscosity. With such a closure the Reynolds stress term\ntakes the same form as the mean viscosity term, but with a different viscosity. In\nessence, this closures states that turbulent eddies are similar to molecular motions\nthat constantly act to redistribute and homogenize momentum. Similarly, for the\ntracer flux term we can define an eddy diffusivity\nu′b′ = -κT ∇ b.\n(3.34)\nThis eddy viscosity/diffusivity closure is the most commonly used in modeling and\ninterpretation of geophysical observations. At the crudest level κT and νT are assumed\nto be constants; in more sophisticated models they are functions of the large scale\nflow. However, an eddy viscosity/diffusivity closure is rarely appropriate.\n(Further reading: Chapter 1 of McComb)"
