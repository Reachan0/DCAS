Biological function at the molecular level is particularly emphasized and covers the structure and regulation of genes, as well as, the structure and synthesis of proteins, how these molecules are integrated into cells, and how these cells are integrated into multicellular systems and organisms. In addition, each version of the subject has its own distinctive material.\n7.014 focuses on the application of these fundamental principles, toward an understanding of microorganisms as geochemical agents responsible for the evolution and renewal of the biosphere and of their role in human health and disease.\nAcknowledgements\nThe study materials, problem sets, and quiz materials used during Spring 2005 for 7.014 include contributions from past instructors, teaching assistants, and other members of the MIT Biology Department affiliated with course 7.014.

Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall, 2002. ISBN: 9780130819239.\n\nRecitations\n\nRegular weekly attendance is expected. Each recitation section meets twice per week for 50 minutes.\n\nTutors\n\nTutors are available at no charge for all students who wish to have extra help with the course material, either on a one-time or on a regular basis.\n\nUnit and Lecture Questions\n\nAt the start of each unit of the course we will post Unit questions on the website. We will also post lecture questions before each lecture. You are encouraged to consider how the material presented throughout the unit relates to the unit questions, and how the material presented in a given lecture relates to the daily questions. We will post our answers to these questions as soon as it is appropriate.\n\nAssignments\n\nThere are seven problem sets for this course. The lowest problem set grade is dropped in calculating your final grade (see below). Although you may engage in general discussions of problems, sharing of answers is a violation of the trust placed in all students in the class, each of whom is entrusted with producing her/his own set of answers. Students who copy problem set answers or allow their problem sets to be copied may receive a 0 for all the Problem Sets (and thus lose 20% of the grade).\n\nCompleted problem sets must be put in the appropriate TA's box in the wooden cart by the due date/time.\n\nNote: Problem sets will not be accepted late and will be scored\nzero\npoints if not turned in on time.\n\nExams\n\nThree quizzes and a final exam are given in this course. The quizzes are given during the term and a comprehensive final (worth 2 quizzes), given during finals week.\n\nThe lowest letter grade score of the five (the 3 quizzes plus the final worth 2 quizzes) will be dropped when calculating your overall grade. Because we drop the lowest score, there will be\nno make-up quizzes\nand\nno conflict quizzes\ngiven for any reason. If you miss a term quiz, it will be the score that is dropped.\n\nThe Final Exam is a 3-hour, cumulative exam, covering the entirety of the course. The score on the final exam will be halved and each half counts as a quiz score when calculating your grade. The final represents two of the five quiz scores and\nmust be taken\n, otherwise you lose 20% of your grade. If your score on the final is your lowest grade then one of the halves will be dropped.\n\nThe date, time, and location of the final will be announced as soon as this information is available. A\nconflict final exam may be scheduled\nby the registrar for students with legitimate exam conflicts.\n\nQuiz Review Sessions\nwill be held prior to each quiz - the dates, locations and times of the reviews will be announced during the term.\n\nAny quizzes, exams, or problem sets that are not picked up by the end of the term will be disposed of.\n\nGrades\n\nACTIVITIES\n\nPERCENTAGES\n\nNOTES\n\n6 of 7 Graded Problem Sets\n\n20%\n\nLowest of 7 problem set scores dropped\n\n4 of 5 Quizzes\n\n80%\n\nLowest grade of \"five\" quizzes dropped (3 one-hour quizzes during term plus the 2 quiz scores derived from the Final Exam, whose score will be divided in two, each half counting as one quiz score)",

And I will be co-teaching this\ncourse with Penny Chisholm who is a professor in the Department of Civil and\nEnvironmental Engineering, as well as a professor in the Biology Department. As\nwell, Penny was recently featured in the journal Nature. She is a very well-known\noceanographer who has become deservedly famous for discovering a very small\nbacterium that's capable of carrying out photosynthesis. For many years\noceanographers used filters whose holes were big enough that this bacterium went\nthrough.\nAnd so when they were doing their studies of the ocean and how the biomass that\nwas there and all the fluxes and so on, they didn't know this organism existed which\ncan form up to 50% of the biomass in parts of the ocean. So Penny is really a\nwonderful lecturer, a wonderful person, and she'll be teaching the component of\n7.014 which deals with ecology and the environment. And this is a section of 7.014\nthat makes it different from the other two versions, 7.012 and 7.013. So for me\npersonally this is an absolutely wonderful and exciting opportunity to be able to\nteach this Introductory Biology course. For some of you I know that biology is going\nto either be a major part of your career or quite possibly, even if you're in\nengineering or something else, you will find yourselves working with a biological\nsystem.\nYou can see that happening all over campus these days that more and more\nengineering departments are finding that they're working on problems that come\nfrom biology or have a biological component. I'm sure there are at least a few of you\nhere who are only here because it's a required course and you might well wish you\nwere somewhere else. However, I will do my best to try to communicate to you why\nyou need to know some biology, too.\nI think most of you know you can hardly pick up a newspaper these days without\nrunning into something that demands a knowledge of biology, something about stem\ncells, something about cloning humans, something about a new drug, lots of things\nhaving to do with biological affects on the environment and so on. You're also going\nto be confronted with decisions about your health, about the health of your loved\nones concerning cancer, concerning whether a child might have birth defects, all sort\nof issues that will affect your personal lives that demand an understanding of\nbiology.\nSo I feel with some passion that whether you think you're going to need biology in\nyour professional career or not, everyone in this institution needs some\nunderstanding of biology to just live their ordinary lives. I also think as MIT students\nyou're going to be looked at, as you go through your lives, as people who are\nknowledgeable about science and engineering. And you'll be asked questions that go\nfar beyond your immediate area of expertise. And again I think that's another reason\nfor needing to know some of biology.\n\nAnyway, it's an absolutely wonderful time to teach biology because things have just\nbeen exploding over the last two or three decades and things are moving faster than\never. And another wonderful thing about teaching biology is that MIT is an absolutely\nmarvelous place to teach it. Just to sort of drive this home, in the Biology\nDepartment alone there are four Nobel laureates who got honored for critical\ndiscoveries in biology. Gobin Khorana who is just down the hall from me synthesized\nthe first gene. It was an extraordinary feat of synthesis of organic chemistry\nsynthesizing DNA. When I was an undergrad I was a chemistry major but I had to\ntake an introductory biology course. And at that point the DNA wasn't mentioned in\nthe high school course.\nSo the first time that I heard about DNA was in my introductory biology course. And\nthat determined by career direction. I thought that was such an interesting molecule\nthat I wanted to work on it and I talked myself into one of the labs in Ottawa,\nCanada where I grew up that was trying to synthesize DNA, synthesize pieces of the\ngene. And, as it turned out later, competing unsuccessfully with my now colleague\nGobin Khorana. Susumu Tonegawa got a Nobel prize for discovering the amazing\nmolecular operations that underlie the diversity of the immune system.\nYour immune system has the capacity to recognize viruses and bacteria, all sorts of\ndifferent pathogens, including molecules. It can recognize molecules that haven't\neven ever been synthesized in the history of life. And we'll talk towards the end of\nthe course about the way that happens. And you'll see why Susumu got his Nobel\nprize. Phil Sharp got his for discovering RNA splicing completely unanticipated\ncomponent of the very heart of molecular biology. And then Bob Horvitz who was of\npure mind when he started at MIT at the same time and our labs were side by side\nfor many years, got his Nobel prize in 2002 for discovering a phenomenon, the\ngeneral term is \"programmed\" cell death. And it plays all sorts of important roles in\nbiology from sculpting the shapes of organs and tissues.\nWe initially have webs when we're developing between our fingers, and those go\naway because of the programmed cell death that the cells that were making the web\ndisappear. And another role of that is prevent cancer. That if cells sense that\nsomething is very messed up they have a sort of suicide program that would make\nthem destroy themselves. And if that doesn't happen those cells could go on and\nbecome more and more abnormal and eventually turn into an invasive cancer.\nAnyway, there's a picture of Bob when the institute was celebrating his Nobel prize.\nHe was getting a congratulatory kiss from Martha Constantine-Paton, also a\nprofessor in the Biology Department who happens to be Bob's wife. Most of you\nknow that the human genome has now been sequenced. That was one of the huge\nundertakings and most important undertakings in modern biology over the last\nwhile. It was an incredible feat. Each cell has, as most of you know, 46\nchromosomes. And that's a total of about two meters of DNA in every human cell.\nAnd that two meters of DNA is composed of about 3 million DNA base pairs, these\nletters A, T, G and C that we'll be talking about as we go through the course.\nSo to sequence the genome you had to work out the sequence of the exact run of\nthese A, G, T and Cs along the backbone for 3 billion base pairs. And somewhere\nthat genome encodes somewhere between 20,000 and 30,000 genes. And we'll be\ntalking about the proteins that are encoded by most of those genes and their\nimportant roles as we go on in the course. What some of you may not know is the\nkey role that MIT played in this. About a third of the genome was sequenced at the\n\nWhitehead MIT Genome Center. And here are some of the robots that were used to\nsequence that DNA. And that sequencing effort was led by Eric Lander whose name\nsome of you may recognize because he teaches the fall version of 7.\n012 along with Bob Weinberg. So here are just a few examples of why I think it's\nimportant for you to understand biology regardless of whether you're going to go on\nand use it professionally. Most of you know one of the biggest challenges we face on\nthis planet is this AIDS epidemic. It's caused by a certain kind of virus called HIV-1\nthat gets into particular cells of your immune system that normally defends us\nagainst infection and destroys those.\nAnd then people die from infections by other organisms that normally you can fight\noff. It's a huge problem with vast societal and economic implications. And it's one\nthat we're still, as a mankind still trying to deal with and grapple with. Here's\nanother example. Just a couple of years ago there was the scar of anthrax. It's a\nbacterium that's very pathogenic and kills its host fairly easily. It does it by making\nparticular toxins. The details shown here don't matter, but just reminding you that\nthis is something that was in the front pages of the paper just a little while ago. A\ncouple of years ago, when I was teaching this, we had the scare of the SARS virus\nthat went all the way during the course when I was teaching it from the initial\ndiscovery of the virus to the actual sequencing of the genome which had happened\nby later on in this course.\nSmallpox was a disease we thought that we eliminated, but now it's come back as a\nbioterrorism treat and there is increased study of smallpox. It's something we have\nto worry about again.\nHere's another example. This is a picture showing the start of a transgenic animal.\nWe'll talk about how this process goes later in the course. And it's related also to this\nwhole issue of cloning, using the sense of the word such as in trying to clone a\nhuman or clone an animal to make a genetically identical copy. So you'll see there\nare a couple of different uses of the word cloning as we go through the course.\nThere's a lot of fuss in the news and the newspapers about genetically modified food,\nand people have different positions on it.\nHere's a case where I think the benefit of a genetically modified food could hardly be\nargued with. About two-thirds of the world's population uses rice as their primary\nsource of food. One of the problems with rice is that it doesn't make beta-carotene.\nAnd beta carotene is what our bodies take and use to make vitamin A. And if you\nhave a vitamin A deficiency people are prone to infection. They have immune\ndeficiencies in their immune system and blindness. And this deficiency of vitamin A\ncaused by eating rice afflicts about 400 million people worldwide. Well, rice is only\ntwo chemical steps away from being able to make beta carotene. This is a genetically\nmodified version of rice that has those two extra steps inserted in it.\nAnd you can see it's golden because it's making beta carotene. If people were to eat\nthat form of rice then they wouldn't have this problem with vitamin A deficiency.\nPenny Chisholm in her part of the course will be considering things that are more\nglobal level. Here's a picture of our planet, and there are issues that you know about\nthere. This is the carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere rising. And that's a real\nphenomenon.\n\nThis shows from 1960 to 1995. This is associated with a global warming that again is\nundeniable that it's happening. You'll see stuff in the papers. And these gases,\nparticularly carbon dioxide and methane, they're known as greenhouse gases are\nplaying a role in that. And probably mankind is playing a role in the production of\nthose gases and, hence, in global warming. And Penny will talk to you a little more\nabout that. Right here at MIT Mario Molina in EAPS discovered the ozone hole and\ngot a Nobel prize for that. Ozone is important because it absorbs UV, a critical\ncomponent of ultraviolet radiation that would damage our cells if we were exposed to\nit. And because of the emission of fluorocarbons in the environment this large hole\ndeveloped over Antarctic.\nIf that had spread, it would have been a real disaster. And that seems to be, the\nefforts to cut down the release of fluorocarbons seem to be helping with that. But,\nagain, Penny will have more to say. Those of you who've lived around here for a little\nbit probably know that the fishing industry just locally has had a very hard time.\nThere is a fishing boat just up in Gloucester, just up the coast less than an hour from\nhere. And part of the problems, again, are caused by mismanagement of the\nresources where the fish have been, stocks have been over-fished so some of the\nfisheries have come to the point of collapse or near.\nPlaces such as the Grand Banks off of Newfoundland there has been a collapse, and\nit's not at all clear that it can be reversed and whether they'll be cod in large\nquantities every again there. OK. So there a variety of ways that we can study\nbiology.\nAnd I think I'm going to begin by outlining how we do that. Biology is an\nexperimental science and it's one of the really important themes that we'll run\nthrough in this course. You cannot study biology by just sitting down with a pen and\npaper in a room and thinking. You have to get out and find out what's there. You\nneed to make observations. You need to try experiments. You need to formulate\nhypotheses and test them and either modify your hypothesis or reject it and so on.\nBut it's a continual cycle of experimentation and making hypotheses and testing. It's\nthe Scientific Method at work. But you can carry that out at different levels. The very\nhighest level would be the biosphere.\nHere's one example. That's earth. It's here. There are many, many species of life\nthat are on there. There are many more than a million. And the estimates of how\nmany there are range from, in total, 10 to the 20 million estimated. And one of the\nbig worries right at the moment is that as rain forests are being depleted, parts of\nthe world that are a rich source of biological diversity, as those are disappearing\nwe're losing diversity at quite a rate. Just a couple of years ago I had a chance to fly\nover a part of Brazil. And it was just scary to see from the plane how the rain forest\nwas just being cut down.\nAnd you could just see how fast some of the rain forest was disappearing, and with it\nmany different types of species that only can live there. One can look instead, going\ndown a level, at an ecosystem which is a particular environment -- -- and the species\nof life found in it. And just to give you a couple of examples of that, it could be a salt\nmarsh as shown here. Or here's an interesting environment that Penny Chisholm will\ntell you more about. This is a black smoker. There's a vent several miles deep in the\nPacific Ocean. The water temperature that's gushing out of here is around 360\ndegree centigrade. And there's a particular community of life that's able to grow\naround these deep vents.\n\nAnd Penny will tell you more about that. Then going down yet another level you can\ncome to a population. And this is interacting -- -- or interbreeding organisms. An\nexample might be the fiddler crabs in a salt marsh. Or here we see an interesting\npopulation. These are tube worms that are up to a meter or more in length that you\nfind down at these black smokers. If we move down yet another level -- -- we come\nto organisms.\nOrganisms have three important sorts of characteristics that we'll talk quite a bit\nabout in this course. They carry out metabolism which is the sum of all the different\nchemical reactions necessary for life. They undergo regulated growth -- -- and they\nreproduce. And the sort of fundamental unit of life that we will talk about over and\nover again in this course is known as a cell. And life comes in two kinds of species.\nThere is unicellular life where the organism is just a single cell and multicellular\nforms of life that are made of many different types of cells.\nWhat's a cell? One of the secrets to life. It's a little tiny bit of the universe that's\nsurrounded by a boundary. And it's given the special name of a membrane. It's\nselective, not very permeable to most things. And cells are able to put little\nimporters and exporters and things that control the passage of things across the\nmembrane by isolating the inside of a cell from all the rest of the universe. That is\none of the principles that makes life possible. We have a couple of examples of\norganisms here.\nHere are some clams that grow down at those black smokers, and they can get\npretty large. And, as I say, Penny will talk a bit more about this. And we have this\nreally amazing diversity of life forms that we find on this planet. However, if we think\nabout this division into unicellular and multicellular organisms. Unicellular organisms\ninclude things that you're familiar with. They're bacteria. There is a picture of just E.\ncoli cells. And we'll be talking about E. coli quite a bit as a model organism as we go\nthrough the course. By studying E. coli, scientists have learned many important\nthings that apply to all of life. Another kind of important single-celled organism,\nunicellular organism is yeast.\nThose are pictures of yeast saccharomyces that are used in baking bread or in\nbrewing beer or making wine. And another one you're all familiar with are algae\nwhich are single-celled organisms that are able to carry out photosynthesis. And we'll\nbe talking about that. If we think of an example of a multicellular organism then we\nsee there are different levels at which we can think about this. We could take, for\nexample, a picture of me, just an anatomically correct diagram here, that I'm made\nup, as you are, of about ten to the fourteenth human cells. We all started out as a\nfertilized egg, which is a single cell.\nAnd by the time we're grown up, where we have about ten to the fourteenth human\ncells. Just a tremendous amount of cell growth that had to happen and\nspecialization. The other thing you may not appreciate is that we have an ecosystem\ninside us in our gastrointestinal tract. This part, the intestine having the highest\nconcentration of microorganisms. But there are about ten to the fourteenth bacteria\nalso inside of our gut. So we're actually almost the same number of human cells and\nbacterial cells. And if we don't have those bacteria then our digestive systems don't\nwork well. So if we go down from a whole organism, a whole multicellular organism,\na level, then we come to an organ.\n\nAn example of that might be an eye. And I think we have a diagram of an eye which\nis made up of different parts. If we go down another level we come to a tissue.\nWhich is now you can begin to see that tissue are made up of groups of specialized\ncells. An example might be the retina of an eye. And if we continue to go downwards\nwe'll get to single cells. And at this point we're at the same level of the tail as when\nwe're talking about a unicellular organism. If we continue down then -- -- we can get\nto organelles.\nThese are involved in energy production, energy management. And mitochondrion\nand chloroplasts are the two principle examples of organelles that we'll talk about.\nAnd if we go down yet another level of organization we get to molecules. And part of\nthe reason that biology has flourished so well over the last few decades at MIT is\nthere has been a real emphasis on looking at things at a cellular and molecular level.\nSo you're going to be hearing a lot about cells and a lot about molecules as we go\nthrough this course.\nHere's an example of rhodopsin. That's a protein. We'll be talking about what\nproteins are, but it's a very important class of molecule in nature. In this case,\nproteins involved in sensing light and play an important part in your vision. Here is\nanother protein. You cannot really tell what it's doing by just looking at it, but in this\ncase this is one of the lethal factors that is made by anthrax. It's one of the proteins\nthat anthrax makes that's capable of killing you if you get infected with it. Here's\nanother molecule we'll talk about in great detail. This is DNA. You probably all know\nit's a double helix, two strands of DNA that are held together by forces we'll be\ndiscussing. It's an absolutely beautiful molecule.\nIt's fascinated me through all of my life. And we'll be talking quite a bit about that as\nthe course goes on. OK. So if we're thinking about cells there are two important\nkinds of cells that one finds on this planet. Prokaryotic cells. Prokaryotic organisms\nand eukaryotic organisms. They each are made of cells that are distinguishable from\neach other. I've indicated that a cell is a little bit of the universe that's surrounded by\na boundary or a membrane. But inside there, inside of this is the DNA which\nfunctions as the genetic material. It's the blueprint for everything that that cell is\ngoing to make and be able to do.\nUltimately everything is encoded there. And in a prokaryotic cell the DNA is free\nwithin this membrane. The eukaryotic cell also has a membrane. But the DNA inside\nis inside another membrane compartment known as the nucleus. And this is the\nDNA. These prokaryotic cells tend to be of the order of a kilometer in length. And\neukaryotic cells are usually larger, can be ten to a hundred kilometers. There's quite\na bit of variation, but that gives you at least some sense of the range.\nNow, I've for years, when I did a diagram like this, I wanted to somehow be able to\nshow you that these cells were impressive than just what's on the board. So here are\na couple of pictures to try and do that. This shows a picture of E. coli swimming\nalong. And the way this image is being taken lets you see what are called flagella but\nwhich are basically the propellers that E. coli have that let it swim through the water.\nThese are long structures made of proteins that are several times the body length of\nthe bacterium.\nAnd there's a molecular motor imbedded in the bacterium that whirls it around at\nabout somewhere between 10,000 and 100,000 RPM. And that's what drives the\nbacteria forward. So that was a prokaryotic cell. Here's a paramecium. This is a\n\nsingle-celled eukaryotic organism. And, as you can see here, it's capable of\nmovement as well. In this case it has cilia along the outside that allow it to move.\nHere's an interesting one. I don't know if any of you can guess what these were.\nThese were cells from the skin of a mouse. They're on an Auger surface. And, as you\ncan see, they too can move.\nThere are a couple of things that are important about this. I got this slide from Linda\nGriffith who is in the Biological Engineering Department. At the time I got it from her\nI think it was in Chemical Engineering several years ago. And what was important\nabout this, apart from it being a very nice little movie showing you a mammalian cell\nmoving around, was that I saw Linda show this during one of her research seminars.\nSo here is an engineer at MIT who was showing this picture as part of her research\ntalk.\nAnd I think those of you who are going onto engineering, you may be surprised at\nthe extent to which you need to know about biology as you go through your\nprofessional careers. OK. So one of the great discoveries that has happened over the\nlast few years that came out of our ability to look at DNA and RNA was the discovery\nthat the forms of life that are prokaryotic actually split into two distinct Kingdoms\nthat are very, very different. The archaea and the bacteria.\nAnd just to give you a sense of the diversity of life, I'll just mention a couple of\nthese. These archaea look like bacteria but they are diverged from the bacteria as\nthey are from the eukaryotes. So there were sort of three really major Kingdoms of\nLife. And the archaea, many of them can live in specialized environments. For\nexample, sulfolobus can live at about 90 degrees centigrade and a pH of somewhere\nbetween 1 and 2. So if you see something like a hot springs, there are organisms\nsuch as this that are able to grow in that environment. Or there are halophyes, salt-\nloving archaea that can grow, for example, in formula sodium chloride. And if you've,\nfor example, ever flown into San Francisco airport coming up from the south over\nSan Jose, you've seen things that look sort of like these pictures where seawater is\nbeing evaporated down to collect the salt.\nAnd you'll see they're colored, and the reason they're colored is that these\nhalobacteria are photobacteria that are able to use light as an energy source. And\nthey make pigments that absorb the light, and that's why these salt areas get\ncolored. A third example would be methanogens.\nThese are organisms that produce methane. If you've walked into a lake and stepped\non the bottom and seen little bubbles come up, those are little bubbles of methane.\nOr another place where you find methanogens are inside of cows. Now, some of you\nmay not know that the cow is more or less a walking anaerobic fermentor here. If we\nhave an anatomically correct picture of a cow. The inside of the cow, there's a large\nchamber known as the rumen where there's no oxygen, and there's a culture of\nmicroorganisms there that include methanogens. And it's this combination of\nmicroorganisms that enables cows to each grass that we cannot manage to get\nenergy from.\nAnd as a byproduct of this specialized type of metabolism produces methane. And a\ncow burps something of the order of 400 liters a day of methane. OK. So one last\nthing then just to kind of pull this all together is that these organelles that I\nmentioned, which are also membrane compartments that are found in eukaryotic\ncells, are the mitochondria -- -- or chloroplast.\n\nThere's pretty strong evidence at this point that these arose from bacteria that were\nthings that you're more familiar with. Things like E. coli or streptococcus that causes\nstrep throat or the lactic acid bacteria that causes the milk to turn into yogurt which\nsome of you probably had for lunch today. That these organelles, the mitochondria\nand the chloroplast were derived from particular type of bacteria that probably first\ngot transiently associated with developing eukaryotic cells sometime back in\nevolution, and eventually became captured and became a permanent part of the\neukaryotic cell. The mitochondrion is thought to have derived from something that\nlooks like today's present day rizobia, which we'll talk about, that form an\nintracellular infection of plants, or rickettsia which is chronic intracellular pathogen.\nThe mitochondrion look as though they came from something related to that.\nThe chloroplasts look as though they came from a bacterium that was able to carry\non photosynthesis which we'll also be talking about. I want to close by giving you\njust a quick little snapshot of evolution because I'm hoping this will maybe make\nsome of the things that we talk about in this course clearer. So what we're going to\ndo is we're going to look back from 4.5 billion years ago when the earth was just\nforming -- -- to now.\nI'm just going to try and give you a few key sort of landmarks as we go along. So\nabout 4.5 billion years ago there was methane, carbon dioxide, ammonium,\nhydrogen gas, nitrogen gas, water, but importantly no oxygen at that point. There\nwas a lot of debate as to how life initially came. One of the prevalent theories at this\npoint is there's something called an RNA world. This is just a hypothesis in which it's\nthought that perhaps the molecule RNA, which we'll talk about, played role as both\nsomething that was able to catalyze chemical reactions and therefore did things\nactively and also stored information. But, in any case, the best guess is that the first\nlife that was about 3.8 billion years ago, somewhere in that vicinity. It was\nsomething that probably resembled most closely a present-day bacterium, a single-\ncelled organism, something like that.\nNow, initially when life got started it's thought that there were a lot of organic\nchemicals that had been made as a consequence of lightening strikes and all sorts of\nchemistry that had happened so there was sort of a soup of some kind, some\nmolecules that could be used. So probably these first organisms where able to\nbasically use some preformed nutrients.\nAnd then as the soup began to get depleted by using it they had to learn to\nsynthesize, at least develop systems that would synthesize these building blocks.\nAnd they also had to begin to worry about what to use as energy. And so somewhere\nin here, something that I'll call, in a silly way, photosynthesis released number one.\nBut this was a system that enabled the organism to capture energy from sunlight so\nthat it wasn't now dependent on getting energy by eating some preformed\ningredient.\nIt was then able to take carbon dioxide and make it into forms that were useful, of\ncarbon that were useful for life, and it produced molecules such as sulfur as a waste\nproduct. There was a bit later in evolution, somewhere in here, something we might\nthink of as photosynthesis release two. This was an improved version of\nphotosynthesis. It captured more energy, worked better, but it developed, it had a\nwaste product which was oxygen. Well, oxygen hadn't been in our atmosphere.\n\nAnd the first thing that sort of happened was that the world started to rust. All the\niron, a lot of the iron started to interact with the oxygen. And Penny will tell you that\nat the base of the sea there are huge beds of iron oxide that came from this slow\nrusting of the earth. And so it took many, many years before oxygen levels started\nto rise. As you know it's about 20% of our atmosphere now. Even at this stage it was\nonly a few percent of our, made up a few percent of our atmosphere, even by here in\nevolution.\nThe first eukaryotic cell is thought to have appeared somewhere here. Again, it was\nlikely a single-celled organism like some of those pictures I showed you. And\nevolution continued to go. Somewhere around a billion years ago sex was evolved\nwhich enabled eukaryotic organisms to exchange genetic material, and therefore\nevolve at a fast rate than they could previously. The Cambrian Period was about a 0.\n5 billion to 0.6 billion years ago. And there was a veritable explosion of life forms.\nAnd you can still see in the fossil records how much diversity was generated at that\npoint, some of which went on to become life forms and other which probably were\nmore evolutionary dead ends. Finally we get to the dinosaurs that were about 245 to\n65 million years ago which would place them somewhere here on this timeline. So in\nhonor of this course, I've commissioned a full scale model of anatomically correct\n[NOISE OBSCURES]. So we'll put our dinosaur here, if I can get him to stay put for a\nminute.\nAll right. And at this point in evolution things started to get interesting. So\nsomewhere about here, 4 million years ago we've got the first evidence of\nhominoids. Maybe 20,000 years ago we found the cave paintings in France. And then\nthere was the Roman Empire and Columbus discovered America. And you were born\nand the Red Sox won the World Series and the Patriots have just won the Super\nBowl. And we are now here at the peak of evolution which is, as you all know, the\nMIT student. So we'll put our MIT student here, who I can probably not get to stay\nput because you can never get MIT students to stay anywhere.\nBut, in any case, this is sort of a silly demonstration. But there is a very profound\nreason why I'm doing it. And I must say I don't think I'd ever fully appreciated it\nuntil I actually thought of doing this demo for the class. But what I think you can see\nis that evolution, for the most part, happened at the single cell level. Many people\ntended to think evolution, that was about dinosaurs and all that stuff.\nWe can say that dinosaurs are, practically now, most of evolution occurred at the\nlevel of single cells, and that all this amazing diversity we see around us was very\nrecent embellishments in evolution. So that means when you study biology at the\ncellular and molecular level you find tremendous commonalities. If you look inside a\nsulfolobus growing in hot spring, if you look inside an E.\ncoli, if you look inside a yeast and you look inside one of our cells you find that, to a\nhuge extent, many, many of the cellular components are common. They arose\nsimilarly in evolution that they're shared by all forms of life. Of course, there are\nsome things that developed later and are different. But that's one of the reasons that\nyou can learn so much by studying biology at the cellular molecular level and why\nwe'll emphasize it a fair bit in this course. The other thing that I'd like to make out of\nthis, a theme that you'll hear along is that organisms modify their environment. You\ncan see that in the case of oxygen back when the earth formed. There was no\noxygen in our atmosphere. Now we have a lot of it. The reason it's there is because\n\nit was generated by organisms carrying out photosynthesis and generating oxygen\nas a waste product.\nAnd that was an absolutely critical thing to enable creatures such as ourselves, which\nare dependent on oxygen for us just to be alive, if we hadn't had this change in\nenvironment things like us could have, organisms like us couldn't have evolved. So,\nanyway, I hope that will give you a little sort of snapshot of evolution and will help\nguide your understanding of this course. We'll see you at the next lecture."

I think\na point I want to, just to give you a very broad perspective apart from why biology is\ninteresting, I want to talk about just very briefly how we study biology. I sort of\ntalked about it the other day by sort of the levels at which we could do it, from the\nbiosphere all the way down to the molecular level. But there is another way of\nlooking at it.\nAnd I just want to remind you of what I said the other day. Biology is an\nexperimental science What we know or think we know at the moment is because of\npeople having made observations, designed hypotheses, tested them and so on. And\nwhat you're seeing is sort of the sum of the current state of human knowledge when\nI'm talking to you right now. There are various, two sort of major disciplines that\nhave been used to get at how biological function works.\nAs you'll see, the main actor for many of the things that happened inside of cells and\nin living organisms are proteins. And we'll be talking about what those are and their\nstructures in some detail at the next thing. But the information is not coded in the\nproteins. The information for coding everything that's in a cell is in units called genes\nwhich are made of, as you probably all know, DNA.\nSo there have been, classically there were two approaches towards studying biology\nin detailed ways. One was the approach of the biochemist who basically took\nwhatever it was, put it in a whirling blender or something, and ripped everything into\nlittle pieces. Sort of like taking the alarm clock and shaking it so hard all you've got\nis all the little bits. And once you got it into all little bits then you can purify a little\nthing like a spring or a little wheel or something and try then to figure out what that\ndoes in the context of the cell.\nYou can get very detailed information. And this is in a sort of trivial way the science\nof, discipline of biochemistry. Geneticists take a different sort of approach. And what\nthey do is they take the living organism and look for a variant where there has just\nbeen one single change in that whole organism and they study its properties. And\nwhat you learn from that is physiologically relevant information.\nAnd if you broke up a car and purified the ashtray you could postulate that that was\nreally important for the car. But if you made a mutant that was missing the ashtray\nand it still ran, you know, you'd learn that that wasn't what was correct. And one of\nthe really powerful things that people could only do in very rare instances for a long\ntime was to unite the kinds of observations that biochemists made with the kinds of\nobservations geneticists made.\nAnd the explosion in knowledge that's happened over the last couple of decades,\nprobably, well, since probably 1975 when recombinant DNA came in, was a whole\nnew realm of sort of a general discipline we call molecular biology that allowed us to\nclone genes, to sequence them, to many of the things we'll be talking about. But one\n\nof the real powers in looking at this sort of way of thinking about how we study\nbiology is that it suddenly enabled one to put these two sorts of things together.\nIf you were a biochemist and you purified a protein and you found out a chemical\nproperty that it had and you wondered what it did in the cell, you could sequence the\nprotein and deduce what some of the DNA sequence was, find the gene, disable the\ngene in the organism, look and see if your idea was right. Or vice versa, if you were\na geneticist and you found a mutant that had an interesting property and you\nwondered how it was working then you could clone the gene, look at the protein and\ntry and figure it out.\nAnd that's partly way since about 1975 there has just been this absolute upheaval in\nour knowledge of biology. And we'll be talking about all of these disciplines here as\nwe go through the course. Three or four of you were honest enough to say I'd rather\nbe anywhere on earth but in this class. I'm a senior. I really didn't want to be here.\nAnd I said to you the other day if you'll come I'll give you the best I have to try and\nshow you why I think it's exciting and why it's so relevant to you and your life as you\ngo looking forward to moving on with your careers and your family and everything\nelse.\nHowever, even if you're not interested in this course, don't get caught in the trap\nbecause we're not going to be doing differential equations that it's easy. Part of the\nreason biology is hard is each one of these disciplines has a different kind of\nthinking. And to be very effective in biology right now you have to be able to think\nlike a chemist, how bonds are formed and broken and what's reasonable.\nYou need to be able to think in 3-dimensional structures because everything happens\nin 3-D and biology is very much about fitting shapes together. Genetics is more like\nprobability and statistics. Some of those logic games that you sort of used to try and\ndo. It's more like that. PCR is, I don't know, recombinant DNA, all this sort of stuff is\nsort of a strategy kind of game.\nSo you'll find, as you go through this course, that there maybe some things that are\neasy and some that are difficult. But for you, easier or difficult, you'll need to do a lot\nof different thinking. And then, at the moment, you cannot do biology anymore by\njust being a biochemist or just being a geneticist. You could in the old days, but now\nyou've got to do it all.\nSo where we're going to start right now will be with biochemistry. And just before I\ndo that I just want to show you -- Let's see. I wonder if we're going to be able to see\nthese slides with that light on. I think we'll see if we can do this. So the green\nfluorescent protein, thanks, that's great. The green fluorescent protein, which we\nshowed you the other day, is a protein. And we're going to be talking about that.\nAnd you'll see it's got structures. You've got these sorts of sheets and you'll see little\nhelices. And in a couple of days you'll know what this is all about. But I wanted to tell\nyou a couple of things just before I get into this. This actually was, I showed you\nthat little Barney thing to try to emphasize that if you looked at evolution that way,\nyou can see most of it was at the level of single cells, and that's why things are so\ncommon when you get down to the cellular and molecular level.\nI've actually done that demo one other place, and that was after, I'm an American\nCancer Society research professor, and they asked me to give a talk for the 50th\n\nanniversary of the Illinois Division of the American Cancer Society on the importance\nof basic research. And it was after dinner, 500 people in tuxedos and evening gowns\nand bottles of wine, and they kept shortening my time.\nAnd finally I had ten minutes to get up there in my tux and tell them about the\nimportance of research, basic research. And I finally decided maybe what I could do\nis help them understand why when they gave money to cure cancer biologists went,\nah, signed this one off, and studied all these other organisms, fruit flies and\neverything. So I did this little demo.\nSo I was up on the stage at the Sheraton holding the Barney and the dinosaur doing\nwhat you saw me do here. And I thought of briefly about putting my tux on just to\nkind of, you know, give a little zip to the extra lecture, but decided not to because I'd\nget chalk all over it or something. So if you think I look stupid doing this, you know,\nmy cats thought I was absolutely an idiot afterwards.\nThey looked very, very puzzled as to what was going on. OK. So I'm going to start\ntalking in a couple of minutes about covalent bonds, and you're going to roll your\neyes upwards and think I've heard about that since I was a baby, or some of you will\nthink that. But I just want to keep, you've got to understand something about how\nthe parts that are used in biology are built or it won't make sense. And so just to sort\nof give you something to sort of keep you going here, I want to sort of foreshadow a\ncouple of things that are coming.\nHere's an example of what happens with genetics. This is a single mutation in one\ngene of an individual. This woman has what's known as Werner syndrome. That's\nwhat she looked like as a teenager. That's what she looked like at age 48. That's one\nof these mutations that causes advanced aging. And people are working very hard\non what that, you know, trying to understand aging.\nDuring your time at MIT, there are going to be some, there already have been some\namazing discoveries in the last five years, and it's going to be a time of explosive\ngrowth. But that's just one change. And it offers a huge clue as to why we age.\nHere's another example. These are people who have a human condition called\nXeroderma Pigmentosum. And this was the way they used to look before we\nunderstood it. They have a deficiency in handling damage to their DNA that's caused\nby sunlight.\nSo if they went out in the sunlight once they'd get skin cancer. You can see they get\nskin lesions and everything else. It was due to a defect in just one gene. And it took\nout an important kind of DNA repair. Now they know how it works. The kids who do\nthis only go out at night. They go to summer camp at night. They call them \"Children\nof the Moon\".\nThey look normal and they don't get skin cancer, but they have to live a kind of\nspecial life because of this problem. And people are working on fixing that. That's the\nsort of thing that can come out genetics. Single change, absolutely dramatic affect.\nYou can sort of make inferences that something important is broken in that individual\nbecause the rest of us don't have this problem.\nThe biochemists, you know Watson and Crick, and we'll talk more about their\nstructure of DNA. But DNA has to get replicated. In fact, just in the last couple years\nwe now know that's what's wrong with this person is that they're lacking a special\n\nDNA copying machine that is able to copy over strands of DNA that have damage in\nthem that's caused by sunlight. It's got a very sort of flexible active site.\nIt can accommodate the bulkiness of this UV induced lesion. And so here's a case\nwhere we've now united our understanding of that disease at the ultimate\nbiochemical molecular level and the high level human syndrome. So that's kind of\none thing to sort of keep you going. OK. So here's a cell. That's the fundamental unit\nof life. I said the other day remember cells carry out metabolism.\nThey do regulated growth. They do reproduction. That's what makes them different\nfrom just a bag of proteins and nucleic acids and things. And we could think about\ncells at a couple of different levels. We could think about them in terms of their\natomic composition. I guess we can. Let's see. And if we think about it that way it's\nnot particularly exciting. Hydrogen is about 60%, oxygen is about 20%, carbon is\nabout 12%, nitrogen is about 5%, and then there's a whole lot of other stuff present\nat lower levels, phosphorus, sulfate, magnesium, manganese, selenium, etc.\nThis isn't a particularly helpful way to think about cells. This is perhaps a more useful\nway, and that's to think about it in terms of molecular composition. And we're about\n80% water. Virtually all living organisms, more or less the same, 80% water is what\nour cells are made up of. And of the rest of them, there are four major classes of\nmacromolecule, large biological molecules that make up the rest of cells.\nAnd that's what we're going to be focusing on in a little bit. There are proteins, which\nI've already mentioned today, and that's about 50% of it. Nucleic acids, that's DNA\nand RNA, we'll say that's about 15%. Carbohydrates, which we'll be talking about\ntoday. Lipids about 10%. And there is a bunch of little stuff that is important but\nmakes up the remaining amount.\nBut to understand biology we're really going to have to try and figure out how cells\nwork. We're going to need to talk about the properties of those molecules. And just\nso you'll know, this picture is actually, this was made by somebody at Lawrence\nBerkeley National Labs. As far as I know she still hasn't published it. This is an image\nof an actual cell.\nIt's made by a very fancy technique called x-ray tomography where she sort of takes\na zillion little sort of slices and then assembles the whole thing. This is a yeast cell.\nThat purple thing, artificially colored, is the nucleus. This thing in the middle is a big\nstorage thing called a vacuole in the cell. We cannot see the other cellular\ncomponents right now, but that is a real cell. It looks like a textbook, but it's actually\na yeast cell that got its picture taken by this very fancy thing.\nSo, as I say, we're going to charge right now into starting to think about these\nvarious molecular forces that make possible, that give these various biomolecules or\nbiomacromolecules their properties. And I just want to give you sort of a game plan\nfor how we're going to do this over the next couple of lessons, couple of classes.\nThey're sort of classes of chemical forces.\nAnd today we'll be talking about covalent bonds and hydrogen bonds. And we'll go\nonto to talk about other ones in the next class or two. And then we're going to talk\nabout these biological macromolecules that I just listed. Proteins. Actually, the order\nwe'll be talking about them, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, proteins and lipids. So the\n\nway I'm going to do this is I can tell you about the properties of carbohydrates by\njust talking about covalent bonds and hydrogen bonds.\nAnd once we've discussed those we'll go on here and I'll give you a couple of\nexamples. And once we've learned some more we'll go on and I'll give you some\nother examples. And, as I said, in a second I'm going to say covalent bonds. It's\ngoing to seem boring. Here's just something to sort of keep in, we'll get another one\nin a minute, to look ahead, why do we want to do this sort of stuff? I showed you\nthis picture the other day.\nThese are E. coli swimming along. Those things I told you are those sort of long\nspiral things are bundles of protein filaments called flagella. They're being rotated by\na motor at the end of the bacterium that's rotating ten to a hundred thousand RPM.\nAnd that thing is moving at such a rate, so many body lengths a second that if it was\nme moving at that speed I'd be going 300 miles per hour that many body lengths.\nSo these are bacteria swimming around. The motor that drives them is made of\nproteins. And this is a textbook representation of that motor. It has familiar parts to\nsome of you. Here's a rotator. There's a bushing. There's a drive shaft and so on. It's\ngot parts that you would recognize as an engineer, but it's all made out of proteins.\nAnd that's a textbook diagram. What I want to show you in the next slide is they've\ntaken a whole lot of electron micrographic images of those things, and the resolution\nisn't so good, but they averaged a whole bunch of them.\nAnd this is what it looks like. So you can sort of see this really is a machine. It's built\nof proteins. And to understand how these machines work you have to understand\nsome of these forces. So that's why I'm going to start in and we're going to begin\nwith covalent bonds so that we're all on the same page right from the beginning. And\nanother aspect, as you'll see, even though you may have heard about some of these\nbonds before, there's a new issue that's going to need to occupy your attention.\nAnd that is, what's the strength of the bond in the context of temperatures and\nconditions that are relevant to life? If you can break a bond at 1000 degrees it\ndoesn't matter because you cannot have life at that temperature. You've got to be\nthinking about a much more restricted temperature sort of range. So covalent bonds,\nas most of you know, this is the principle force that holds atoms together. It involves\na sharing of the electrons.\nAnd an example you can all do in your sleep, I'm sure. If we take four hydrogen\natoms and a carbon atom we can come up with this molecule which has four\ncovalent bonds. This is methane. That's the molecule that the cow we saw the other\nday burps 400 liters of. Those are the little bubbles you see coming up when you\nwalk around the edge of a lake. And it's usually those pairs of electrons, as you\nknow, that are usually represented like this.\nThe typical length is about 0.15 to 0.2 nanometers. And the important thing about\nthese bonds is these are strong. It takes about 83 kilocalories per mole to break a\ncarbon-carbon bond. So at physiologically relevant temperatures they don't break.\nThey can rotate, they can stretch and they can bend, but they're not going to break.\nAnd so if you have a carbon-carbon bond in a biological organism it will be doing\nthis.\n\nThe carbons will be going this way. They'll be bending back and forth this way but\nthey won't be breaking. And to just give you a sense of how far away they are from\nbreaking, the energy of, say, one of these vibrational modes is about 0.6 kilocalories\nper mole so that you have -- The average bond is so far away from breaking, even\nthough it's a distribution, and some are more than others that our molecules stay\ntogether, which is good because we wouldn't want our DNA flying apart because the\ncovalent bonds were breaking under physiological conditions.\nBut that also leads us to the need for one of the things that we'll have to talk about,\nwhich is one of the great secrets of life, is that the metabolism, all stages of life\ninvolve the making and the breaking of bonds. And you cannot just add a platinum\ncatalyst and put it at 500 degrees centigrade under a thousand atmospheres of\npressure. All the chemistry that happens in life has to take place in aqueous solution\npretty close to pH 7 at about, you know, 25, 37 degree centigrade.\nThere are a few organisms that can do it out, but most of it is somewhere around\nbody temperature. Room temperate is where all that has to take place. So what you\ncan see is that there had to be some, in order for life to occur there had to be some\ninvention that would let bonds be broken and be formed under physiologically\nrelevant conditions. And those are enzymes. I know most of you have heard of\nthose.\nWe'll talk about them in a maybe more sublevel, beyond what some of you have\nheard anyway. But that -- Keep in mind now that's the driving force for why we need\nenzymes, because covalent bonds are so strong. I also remind you that there are\ndifferent types of covalent bonds. That's a single bond. This would be a double bond\nor a triple bond. And they get stronger as you share more electrons.\nIt gets harder and harder to break them. These are double and triple bonds called\nunsaturated bonds. When we talk about unsaturated fats and things that's because\nthey have double bonds in them. So olive oil has double bonds in it and beef fat, for\nexample, doesn't. Other molecules that have double bonds that are important are\noxygen and nitrogen gas, which has got a triple bond.\nAnd when Penny talks to you about the nitrogen cycle this is one of the really\nimportant ones thinking about ecology because we all use nitrogen, but most\norganisms including ourselves and most things on earth cannot break that bond. Yet\nwe all need nitrogen. It has be what they called fixed, so it's joined to something like\nammonia or nitrite or something like that.\nAnd that little fluorescently labeled bacteria I showed you invading a plant, we'll see\nit again, is able to form a symbiosis of plant. It's one of the few creatures on earth\nthat knows how to break that bond. And that's why you can get plants that can\ngrow, like peas and beans and alfalfa and things that can grow without nitrogen\nfertilizer. Because they have a little bacterium who knows how to break that bond\nand they figured out how to get together and collaborate in a symbiosis.\nSo these bonds are very important. So there's another characteristic of these bonds\nwhich is going to be very important for thinking about biology. And it's known as\nchirality. And it comes from the fact that our life on this planet is based on carbon,\nand carbon's ability to form remarkable kinds of bonds. And, as you see over there,\ncarbon forms four bonds. But right now we have to start thinking in 3-dimensional\nspace because carbon is a tetrahedron.\n\nCarbon, four single bonds. And they're in a tetrahedral arrangement. So if I label\nthem like this, this means it's coming out of the board, I'm sorry. A, B, C. And that\nmeans it's going back into the board. So if I do a mirror image, if I looked at what\nthis would look like, if I could look at its reflection in a mirror, I would see it would\nlook like this. So these are what are known as optical isomers.\nAnd depending on how you are at thinking in 3-dimensions this may be obvious to\nyou or it may not be obvious to you, but you cannot superimpose those. And this is\ncritical because all through biology there are carbons that have four different\nsubstituents that join to them. And every time that occurs, biology chooses one of\nthose arrangements, not the other.\nAnd we have sort of a macro way of perhaps communicating this. So you've been at\nthe party at the dorm. I was housemaster in McCormick for six years a while back so\nI've lived at least in that environment. It's early February, you're having to go back\nacross the Mass Ave bridge, it's minus 20 and the wind is whipping along and your\nhands are freezing. And you reach into your pocket to get your gloves and uh-oh,\ntwo left gloves.\nRight there you have the problem. Biology, as a theme you'll hear over and over\nagain, is about fitting shapes. And your hands are mirror images of each other. And\nyou could think of your gloves as being sort of a receptor. And if the receptor is\ndesigned to take your right hand, take your left hand, I guess, let's say, you cannot\nget your right hand into the glove. It just doesn't fit.\nAnd it's at a molecular level. It's exactly that same thing. So we're going to have to\nworry as we go through this about not only how many bonds there are, but this is\nwhy the exact molecular shape, including this optical isomer issue is going to be very\nimportant. There's another very important principle of covalent bonds that has,\nagain, a huge impact on biology. And that concerns how the atoms involved in the\nforming that covalent bond think about sharing electrons.\nIn some cases the sharing is pretty much equal, as in a carbon-carbon bond. That\nwould make sense since it's the same thing on both sides. Or a carbon-hydrogen\nbond. The sharing of electrons is pretty much the same, so the electrons on average\nare distributed in between them. And this is what's known as a nonpolar bond.\nHowever, there are important cases of unequal sharing. And the characteristic of an\natom or an element that determines how this sharing goes is known as\nelectronegativity.\nAnd you could think of this as sort of a euphemism for the greediness of an atom for\nelectrons. So if you have an oxygen-hydrogen bond, oxygen is more electronegative\nthan hydrogen. What that means is that although the electrons are still shared, this\nis not an ion or anything, the electrons are shared, there's going to be a little bit of a\nnegative charge on the oxygen and a little bit of a positive charge on the hydrogen.\nAnd that means you, you know, this will have all sorts of consequences, as you'll see\nin a minute. And there's one important molecule, which if we did the molecular\ncomposition you can see there's a lot of it around, and that's water. And it's got two\nOH bonds. And here's where the structure of water is important, that these two\nbonds are not 180 degrees opposite to each other.\n\nThey're 104.5 degrees. So you end up with a little negative charge here, a little\npositive charge here, a little positive charge there. And so every single water\nmolecules sort of have a negative side and more or less a positive kind of side. And\nthis has consequences because this means that the water molecules are going to\ninteract. And to understand that part I need to introduce you to this second force\nwhich we know as the hydrogen bond.\nAnd this is the -- This is a bond that takes place, that arises because of the slight\npositive charge of an H bonded to oxygen or nitrogen -- -- and the slight negative\ncharge -- -- of the oxygen or the nitrogen itself. And right in water we see this is an\nissue, because if we have water like this with a couple little bit of positive charges\nhere and there and a little negative charge here, and there's another water molecule\nover here, a little positive charge, a little negative, a little positive, we can get here\nwhat's known as a hydrogen bond.\nThe hydrogen bond is about one-twentieth the strength -- -- of a covalent bond. And\nthat number is really important, because what that means is that at temperatures\nthat are relevant for life, not all the molecules will have enough energy to break, in a\npopulation will have enough energy to break that bond. But some of them will. So\nhydrogen bonds, let me just write that down, so at physiologically relevant\ntemperatures some molecules -- -- have the energy to break a hydrogen bond.\nAnd we'll talk about it next time. But probably many of you know that DNA is made\nof two strands. And the whole principle of copying the genetic information is you can\npull the strands apart and copy the complimentary information. And we'll spend a lot\nof time talking about that. But the relevant thing for the moment is those two\nstrands, each of which are joined by covalent bonds, are held together by a whole\nseries of hydrogen bonds between the different base pairs.\nAnd so right there sort of is the root of why the cells are able to pull those apart, put\nthem together. And so these hydrogen bonds are really, really important. And\nbecause our life on this planet is based, we're water-based, and the reason water is\nsuch a good solvent is that it is able to form these hydrogen bonds. So this is just a\nlittle movie showing the hydrogen bonds, a little simulation of how they can move\naround and rotate.\nThe green thing would be the hydrogen bonds here. This is not really a full\nrepresentation because the water molecules are constantly changing partners so\nthey form little cages and little shells, but they keep forming hydrogen bonds. They'll\nbreak one with one water molecule and immediately reform with another. This is a\nsimulation that someone did. It's a picosecond of what would happen to water\nmolecules at zero degrees centigrade where they're liquid.\nSo, at this point, they haven't frozen but they're just above that. And you can sort of\nget the sense how they're changing partners here. Here's another simulation done at\n100 degrees centigrade. So this would be a boiling temperature. And what you can\nsee now is every now and then one of the molecules gets enough energy to break\nfree of these cages.\nAnd that, when you're watching something boil in a kettle, that, at a molecular level,\nis what's happening, is one or another molecule is finally getting enough energy to\nbreak free of this sort of chains of hydrogen bonds that are formed. And it's when we\ngo to think about how things interact in water, when you dissolve sugar in water or\n\nsomething in water, you try and dissolve butter in water, when you stick something\ninto water you have to break a whole lot of bonds.\nSo there's an energy cost to just simply putting something into water. And what\nmakes things dissolve or not is whether once they're in there they can form bonds\nback again because water is carbon and hydrogen bonds. There is no polarity. To get\nit to dissolve you'd have to break hydrogen bonds. That costs energy. And it cannot\nform any because it's only got nonpolar bonds in the butter so the butter floats\naround on the water.\nBut this is really a very, very important force. And, in fact, you know, this is why\nwhen some of the really interesting properties of water come from. You all know\nabout surface tension. You've watched little bugs skate around on the surface of the\nwater. This is the lizard that lives in the rainforest of Central and South America, and\nit's about two and a half feet long.\nAnd it can take advantage of this surface tension that's due to the hydrogen bonding\nof water to go scooting right across the water. This is not the greatest of videos. It's\nwhat I've managed to find so far, but you get the idea. It actually runs across the\nwater. And you're watching the hydrogen bonding in action here. When I was a grad\nstudent my work thesis was on the synthesis of ribonucleotides, little pieces of RNA.\nAnd I went in a thesis competition. And at the end, where you're supposed to give a\ntalk about your thesis, and there were four of us, I thought, well, at least I have a\nfighting chance. And when I got in there it turned out one of the other people who\nwas competing was a guy who studied this lizard, so his talk was full of movies of\nthese lizards running back and forth across ponds of water.\nAnd I thought I'm dead meat. But it actually turned out I won it, so I was very\nsurprised. But every time I see something like this it reminds me of it. OK. And just\nto remind you, too, I mean you may not have been thinking of it in this way, but of\ncourse what was all that fuss about when they sent the expeditions to mars? They\nwere looking for traces of water. And why is that so important? It's because water\nhas this amazing capacity to form hydrogen bonds and be the solvent that can let life\ngo.\nThe moon on triton has methane. All nonpolar bonds, they're talking about raining\nmethane and rivers of liquid methane and stuff. You might think about whether it is\npossible to design a life form or not or at least what ways things would have to be\ndifferent. OK. And we've done enough that I can quickly now introduce you to our\nfirst class of molecules which are carbohydrates.\nJulia, would you mind flipping that light back on for a minute? OK. So carbohydrates\nhave the general property, general formula. They're CH20. And you can have\ndifferent numbers of them. N-1 carbons have a COH bond. That's known as a\nhydroxyl group. And one carbon has a double bond oxygen which is either known as\nan aldehyde if it's at the end of a chain or as a ketone if it's in the middle.\nAnd these things can come in different numbers. So if N equals three it's a triose. If\nN equals five it's a pentose. The sugars that you'll see in DNA and RNA are pentoses.\nThey're five carbon units. A six carbon unit is a hexose. And a very common hexose\nthat you're all familiar with, at least familiar with the name of is glucose. And the\n\nstructure of glucose in a linear form, if I draw it out here, it's got the double bond at\none end, so it's an aldehyde in that case.\nAnd then there's an OH this way, OH this way, OH, let's see. One, two, three, four,\nfive, six. OH. And it's just going off the bottom of the end here, bottom of the board\nfor some of you probably. But we have hydrogens in the other places. Now, what I\nhad to do in order to put up this depiction was kind of flatten this molecule, which\nyou'll know every one of these is a tetrahedral arrangement.\nAnd flatten it down so I could write it on the board. So there are actually four chiral\ncenters in a glucose molecule. And, furthermore, although this is a representation\nthat you can find in textbooks and I can write it on the board that's not how it\nappears in nature. What happens is that the oxygen here comes up and actually\ncyclizes to this carbon.\nAnd this hydrogen goes and sits up here. And it gives you, the way glucose is\nactually found in solution, this would be what's known as beta-glucose. And the\nreason I'm saying beta is we've got a new chiral center that's formed by this\ncyclization. And just to give you a sense of where we are, this is one, two, three,\nfour, five, six going this way. And over here it's one, two, three, four, five and six\nthat way. And you can sit there and work this out yourself afterwards.\nThis is known as a pyranose ring because it's got, it's actually a six-member ring, but\nyou can see one of the oxygens is now part of the ring and the extra carbon is\nsticking out here. And in solution, because of this new chiral center, we've now got\nthe possibility of this thing joining so that the OH is up or the OH is down. And when\nit's up, the OH is up, that's known as the beta form.\nAnd if the OH is down, that's known as the alpha form. So, again, we've got to keep\nour eyes on all these chiral centers. This kind of depiction, again, is sort of hard to\ndraw. So, again, people tend to sort of flatten it out. And you'll see this kind of\nrepresentation. You have to realize that this is approximately the 3-dimensional\nshape.\nThis is a representation. Here's beta-glucose there. Every time that you change the\nposition of one of these hydroxyls, we end up with another sugar. So this is beta-\ngalactose, sugar with very different properties. And the difference is here the\nhydroxyl is up, here the hydroxyl is down. Two different sugars, two different\nproperties, but as simple a difference as that. And then a thing that happens in\nnature is you can join different sugar molecules together by a principle that you'll\nsee over and over again.\nAnd that you'll split out a molecule of water and you get a new covalent bond where\nthis oxygen joins over to the carbon over here. And what that gives you is galactose\nbeta-1,4 glucose. This beta-1, 4 glucose is a molecule that you know as lactose or\nmilk sugar. And part of the reason we know about it is because in order to\nmetabolize that you need to have a special enzyme that cuts right here. That\nenzyme is known as beta-galactosidase.\nThat's an enzyme. It's a protein, which we'll be talking about in the coming lectures,\nand it's able to cause this bond to break. And what happens when you become\nlactose intolerant is you lose the beta-galactosidase that we all have as a baby,\n\nbecause we need to be able to eat milk. And if you don't have it then the lactose\npasses through your stomach without getting metabolized.\nIt gets into your intestine and there are those ten to the fourth bacteria. They\nmetabolize it, break that bond, and then that causes the gas and discomfort that's\nassociated with lactose intolerance. So all the textbooks use lactose as the, beta-\ngalactosidase as the common enzyme. So the first time I thought that I'd teach this\ncourse I thought, boy, I have a really good idea.\nI'm going to come up with a sample enzyme that's different, but I have to learn what\nit was. And it was inspired by there's this product called Beano which is supposed to\nreduce the side effects that are commonly associated with eating beans, which\nprobably many of you are familiar with from summer camps and things. And the\ntechnical term is flatulence. But, in any case, this was supposed to be something\nthat reduced flatulence.\nSo I thought it's got to be an enzyme. I know it had something to do with all of the\nsaccharide s that will change the sugar. So I looked at the little thing of Beano, and\nit said Hotline, any questions call. So I phoned up and said, hi, this is kind of an\nunusual question. I'm a college professor and I'm going to be teaching an\nintroductory biology course.\nAnd I was wondering if I could find out what enzyme you had in Beano and what it\ndid to what was in the beans. And I said, you know, it's really sort of an odd question\nbut, you know, maybe I could talk to one of the scientists in the lab. And a woman\nsays, hello, Beano. And she listens to me. And she says, yes, we have a special\npackage we send out to college professors. And the next thing I knew I got this huge\nflood of stuff.\nSo I am now able to quickly tell you why beans are the musical fruit. And the basis\nof it is if you join a glucose and a fructose together by an alpha-1, 2 linkage you get\nsucrose. And you all know that's table sugar. We can eat sucrose no problem. But\nwhat beans have is beans have a galactose alpha-1, 6 linkage to sucrose. Or they\nactually, sometimes they have two galactose alpha-1, 6 linkages to sucrose and we\ncannot metabolize them.\nAnd that's sort of related to the same idea as the lactose intolerance that they go\nthrough a stomach, and then the bacteria know how to break that bond and that\ncauses the problems that you encountered at summer camp. And so what Beano\nturned out to be is it's a sort of low-tech biotech product. It's a food-grade mold\ncalled neurospora. And it's a very, very crude preparation of an alpha-1, 6\ngalactosidase.\nIn other words, an enzyme that can break that molecule. And once it breaks it you\nhave sucrose, which we can eat, and galactose, which we know what to do with. And\nthat's the basis of that. So the very last thing is to talk about polysaccharides. These\ncome when you join together multiple sugars. And, as you can appreciate by now,\nthere are many, many ways of joining sugars together.\nBut suppose we take N glucoses. There are two common ways they can get joined.\nThey can get joined together by alpha-1, 4 bonds. And these give a helical\nconfirmation. And you know these as starch or glycogen. These are energy storage\nmolecules. And I've run marathons, some of you may have, but at least you\n\nprobably know about carbo-loading. What you're trying to do before you go is you're\neating pasta and everything, which is full of starches, so it's got polymerized sugars.\nAnd you're trying to get your body to take these in and polymerize them into\nglycogen so your liver is as loaded with glycogen before you start the race. And\nhitting the wall in a marathon is when you run out of glycogen. And then you start\nburning fatty acids and it's no fun at all. But that's what carbo-loading is all about, is\nmanipulating glucoses that are in an alpha-1, 4 confirmation, if you just make a\nbeta-1, 4 confirmation.\nSo the only difference that's happening in the way we join glucoses together is\nwhether the hydroxyl is up or down when you join the two of them together. You get\nsomething that's a linear molecule that forms hydrogen bonds between the sugars.\nSo you have a linear chain of sugars. And I'm not going to show the details of the\nhydrogen bond, but you have one chain going this way and another chain of sugars\nhere.\nAnd you can get hydrogen bonds between them. And you know this as cellulose. So\nthere are two very important biomolecules that are made up of glucose. That's just\nsome glucose there. And if you join them by alpha-1, 4 linkages you get starch, corn\nstarch, which you've all encountered. If you join them by hydroxyl in the other\ndirection you get cellulose. Cellulose is important in biology.\nIt's what plants make their cell walls of. That's why you can have trees that are so\nenormously high. And I guess I'll close with one last. So most of the paper we get\nfrom cellulose is from trees. If you've ever tried to make beer or wine or something,\nyou probably know you've got to keep fruit flies away or you're going to get vinegar.\nAnd the reason you get vinegar is that the fruit flies carry on their feet a bacterium\ncalled acidobacteria.\nAnd it likes to live at the surface between the water and the air. And what it does\nthen, in order to do that is it makes cellulose, and it floats itself right at the, it makes\nthis great thick mat of cellulose. And it floats itself right at the air surface interface.\nAnd you can get a mat that's half an inch thick of absolutely perfect cellulose. And so\nyou don't ever want to see that if you're trying to make beer or wine or something.\nBut it's a bacterium that's making this molecule. So you find it in other places\nbesides trees. So, OK, we'll see you on Monday."

And\nwe can, for the most part, describe their properties by considering just covalent\nbonds and hydrogen bonds. Although, that's a bit of an oversimplification. But,\nanyway, these are, again, polymers. So this is DNA and RNA, terms you've\nundoubtedly heard. And these are made by splitting out water. And, in this case, the\nmonomeric units are given the special term nucleotide.\nAnd a nucleotide consists of a sugar with something called a base on it. It's got a\nphosphate group at one end and a hydroxyl group, one of the sugar hydroxyls that\nwe saw the other day at the other end. The B stands for base. And the way the bond\nis formed, as I said, is by splitting out water like that to form what's known as a\nphosphodiester bond. And we'll be talking a lot about those when we talk about DNA\nand RNA in more detail later on in the course.\nThe sugars are pentoses where N equals 5. We were talking about these the other\nday. The base goes in this position. That's the 1 position of the carbon. This is the 5\nposition of the carbon. And this is where the phosphate is located. This sugar is\ncalled ribose. And then RNA, which is the polymer of nucleotides that have ribose as\nthe sugar is ribonucleic acid or RNA, as you've known it.\nIf this hydroxyl here is replaced by a hydrogen and the rest of it's the same -- -- this\nis deoxyribonucleoside. And if you polymerize that together then you get DNA or\ndeoxyribonucleic acid. The bases come in two flavors. And this will be on your\nhandout. Ones that either have two rings, adenine or guanine. And the general term\nof those is purine or they have one ring of pyrimidine. And in DNA one finds cytidine\nand thiamine abbreviated as C and T.\nOr in RNA, instead of finding thiamine you find uracil, which is the same except that\nit doesn't have the methyl group that's present at this position on thiamine. And the\nimportant thing about these particular nucleotide bases is that they can form\nhydrogen bonds in a very special way. It's diagramed on here that this is a guanine\npairing with the cytidine, so a G pairing with a C.\nAnd you can form three hydrogen bonds. Or between an A, an adenine and a\nthiamine you can form two hydrogen bonds. Those are just the things we were\ndiagramming on the board the other day. And those are the forces that hold the\nstrands of DNA together so that DNA is the double helix, as you know. It's basically a\nbackbone with sugars and phosphates. And then there'll be some sequence of bases\ndown this.\nAnd then on the other strand you'll have the base that can form hydrogen bonds\nwith this. So C, there would be three hydrogen bonds here. This would be a G on this\nside, again, three hydrogen bonds. If there's an A here that will be a T there, two\nhydrogen bonds. And so on down. And we'll talk about the implications of this later in\nthe course when we talk about DNA replication, but for the moment I think your eye\n\ncan see, you can probably see that the geometric arrangement of these is just\nexactly the same, whether it's a G-C or it's an A-T base pair.\nYou can superimpose them, and they have just exactly the same molecular\nstructure. And that's really crucial for a lot of things having to do with DNA. So, as\nyou know, it's not just sort of a ladder with hydrogen bonds. It's twisted in 3\ndimensional space. That's the double helix. And in that little movie I showed you the\nnitrogen atoms and the bases are blue so you can pretty much pick it out that\nthere's a series of hydrogen bonds going right down the middle of a DNA molecule\nwith the phosphoribose backbone on the outside.\nSo every one of your cells, since you have about 3 billion base pairs you have two\npoint something times that many hydrogen bonds holding your DNA together. The\nthing to remember about the strength of the hydrogen bond, it's about a twentieth a\ncovalent bond, and so you're able to pull those things apart and then put them back\ntogether at physiological temperature while leaving all the covalent bonds that make\nup each strand of the DNA leaving those intact.\nIt's also possible, since RNAs are usually single-stranded, that if you have a little\nsequence here that has the complimentary sequence over there then these can pair\nlike this forming a hairpin or some little structure like that. And, again, we'll talk\nabout transfer RNAs which play a really key role in protein synthesis. They're the\nlittle translators that go back and forth between the nucleic acid code, the genetic\ncode and the protein code, which is written in amino acids.\nAnd this just shows making an RNA copy for a tRNA gene from the DNA, but then\nthese are the relationships between the complimentary sequences right in that\nstrand. So this thing is able to fold up into a sort of cloverleaf structure that some of\nyou have certainly probably seen at some point. It's a little bit twisted here because\nyou can see how the complimentary sequences have found each other.\nAnd even though this is just a single strand of RNA, by forming hydrogen bonds to\ncomplimentary sequences within itself it can take up a structure. And I'll show you.\nIt actually goes on, there are some other forces that come in. And this will fold up\ninto a 3-dimensional structure that goes even beyond what I've shown you, but we\nwon't need to talk about that for just a little bit.\nOK. So then the next -- -- class of molecules that we're going to spend a lot of this\ncourse on are proteins. And these are polymers again. -- made by splitting out\nwater. So that's been true of polysaccharides. It's true of nucleic acids. It's true of\nproteins. In this case the monomers are structures known as amino acids. And they\nhave an amino group. And then it's joined to a carbon known as the alpha carbon.\nAnd then there's a carboxyl group.\nSo this is why they're called amino acids, because their carboxyl group is an acid.\nAnd the way they form -- We'll give these different side chains here. I'll tell you\nabout these side chains in just a minute. The way these form a bond is by splitting\nout water here. And then this will give this very important bond in nature -- -- which\nis known as the peptide bond. And there's a chemical property of this that's\nimportant.\nSomeone was bemoaning the fact that I had to go over a bunch of chemistry and\nthey hadn't liked 5.011. My apologies. But we won't be spending all course doing\n\nchemistry. But if you want to understand how these things work you do need to\nunderstand some of the chemical principles to understand them. And this is a case\nwhere it's really important because, although it's written this way with the double\nbond here and a single bond there, this double bond actually sort of spends part of\nits time over here.\nSo this is actually sort of a partial double bond. And that has an important\nconsequence because if you're a single bond, if you remember a single bond can\nbend and stretch but it can also rotate. But if you're a double bond you cannot\nrotate. So the peptide bond, and you make a lot of these when you're polymerizing\namino acids together to make proteins, those bonds have a very special character\nthat they cannot rotate.\nNow, let me say, I'll come back and show you why that's important in just a\nmoment. But let me just say a word about the side chains. There are 20 different\namino acids. And they have side chains that have very different chemical properties.\nAnd when we start thinking about how a chain of amino acids take up the properties\nthat make it into an enzyme or part of a motor or a structural protein or into your\nfinger nails or your hair or skin, they have to have very special properties.\nAnd it's the sequence of these different amino acids with their different chemical\nproperties that are eventually going to let each protein form up to one particular 3\ndimensional structure that will give it its characteristics. So the different types of\namino acids, and again you won't have to memorize these, but here they are up\nhere. But let me just point out the important classes, because the thing you really\nwant to do with this one is to remember the types of amino acids we find.\nThere are negatively charged amino acids. An example of this would be aspartate.\nUnder physiological conditions, although this is an acid, it will dissociate so it will\nhave a negative charge. And that's abbreviated as A-S-P. Glutamine is another one\nthat has a negative charge. There are also amino acids that have positive charges on\nthe side chain. An example of this would be lysine which has four methylene groups.\nAnd then it has an amino group.\nBut, again, under physiological conditions, around pH 7, that will be protonated so it\nwill have a plus charge. And that is lysine or L-Y-S. And arginine and histidine are\ntwo other amino acids that have a positive charge, or can have a positive charge.\nThen there's a set of amino acids that have a polar character. They don't have a full\ncharge. And, as you might guess, they have one of the bonds that we've talked\nabout that are polar.\nThis is serine. Serine. There's another one that has a hydroxyl that's known as\nthreonine. And then there is a glutamine and asparagine, both of which have an N-H\nbond. So just through what I've told you here, we haven't even been through the\nset, you can see how you can begin to decorate an amino acid chain. So there's a\nplus charge and a minus charge, a polar charge. There's a tremendous amount of\ndiversity because at every single thing you have a choice of 20 things you can put in.\nSo they not only have size and shape characteristics, but they have particular\ncharges and other properties. Then, as always, there are a bunch of special, oh,\nexcuse me. Actually, before we do that, we have hydrophobic. Or you could think of\nthese as greasy or water-hating. These are the ones that are sort of when I was\ntalking about trying to dissolve butter into water. These are things that don't like to\n\ninteract with water or cannot interact with water, and so they cannot form hydrogen\nbonds so you cannot get them to go under water easily.\nAnd they come from very simple ones that have just the methyl group which is\nalanine or A-L-A or one like this which would be CH2-CH with a couple of methyl\ngroups. This is even more water-hating, that would be lucine, L-E-U. Or here's one\nthat you probably could guess that really doesn't interact with water. This is\nphenylalanine or P-H-E. And you can see what this side chain is. It's a methylene\ngroup.\nAnd what's dangling off it but a benzene ring. And I think most of you remember\nfrom probably beginning chemistry that benzene is something that you cannot\ndissolve sugar in or something. It's an organic solvent. It will only dissolve things\nthat have a very hydrophobic character. Then there are some special cases. Glycine\nis one, because in this case the side chain is simply a hydrogen atom.\nAnd, as a consequence to that, this is a very flexible amino acid. So if you want to\nbuild -- If nature wants to build a loop into a protein, it's going to undergo a tight\nturn. You often find glycines there because there's not a big side chain to get in the\nway if you're going to be bending the chain in 3-dimensional space. Another one is\ncysteine, which looks like serine over there, but it has a thiol group instead of a\nhydroxyl group.\nAnd that's important because that allows for the formation of another special type of\nbond that if you have one chain of protein that has a cysteine on it and another\npolypeptide chain that has a cysteine on it and they're close together in space, what\ncan happen is you can form a covalent bond between these under oxidative\nconditions. This is known as a disulfide bond.\nThat's covalent. So those two chains, if that bond occurs, are now sort of semi-\npermanently locked together. They're locked together in a very, very strong way. So\nthis is a feature of, this is the only intrastrand covalent bond that you'd\ncharacteristically find in proteins. All the rest of them we're going to show you, when\nthey fold up in 3-dimensional space, depend on other kinds of interactions.\nAnd finally there's one last case which is proline. And this one is a little different\nbecause in the amino acid the side chain bends around like this and joins here. So\nit's actually forming a little circle here between the nitrogen, the amino group and\nthe carboxyl group. And the consequence of this is this bond cannot rotate. The bond\nthat would normally be able to rotate is not able to do that. And so this is the sort of\namino acid you find that when there are some of these regular structures, I'm going\nto show you in a minute, like helices and things, this protein won't, this amino acid\nparticularly won't fit into those structures.\nSo you tend to, if nature wants to interrupt a particular regular structure that's\ncoming, it will often find a proline right at that particular point. OK. So what we've\ntalked about up until now is sort of just the very, very basic piece of protein\nstructure. It's what called the primary structure which is nothing more than the\nsequence of amino acids. However, here's a little piece of protein.\nThis is polyalanine. And one thing you can sort of see is if I was trying to figure out\nhow to fold this up into a 3-dimensional confirmation. And let's say this had 300\namino acids or something, there are essentially an infinite number of confirmations.\n\nAnd so one of the real holy grails still in biology is trying to understand if you see the\nlinear sequence of an amino acid, which we can now deduce, excuse me, of a\nprotein, of an amino.\nIf you see the linear sequence of amino acids in a protein, and we can deduce those\nfrom analyzing genomes and so on, how do we go from a thing that says a\ntryptophan, a cysteine, a serine, a serine, a threonine, whatever down the chain to\nfinding its 3-dimensional structure and ultimately its role? And you can sort of\nhopefully get a sense from this of why it's important.\nSo there are levels this goes. The next level is what's known as secondary structure.\nThese are regions of local secondary structure and they're determined by hydrogen\nbonds. And I'll show you how these go in just a second. And then you can think\nabout proteins in the tertiary structure. So what we've done and sort of taken a\nchain and then found out how a little region might take up a particular, for example,\nhere's a portion that's in a helix.\nThis is fairly rigid right now because of the way it's held together. And we'll then find\nmaybe another region like a beta sheet I'm going to show you in a minute.\nUltimately we have to figure out how all these units fold up into a 3-dimensional\nstructure. And what we get there is called the tertiary structure. And this has some\nother forces we're going to talk about besides covalent bonds and hydrogen bonds\nthat determine that.\nAnd then, as I've tried to tell you, you can see that proteins play a lot of roles in\nnature and they're not all single proteins running around being an enzyme or\nsomething like that. Many of them are parts of machines so they're made to fit\ntogether in absolutely beautiful ways. Some of them have, at this point, fifty-\nhundred parts that all go together fitting shapes and interacting with these shapes\non the principles that we'll be talking about here, the different forces that make\nthings happen in nature.\nAnd so quaternary means the structure when there's more than one polypeptide\nchain. So getting a handle on protein structure was kind of a very important\nintractable problem for a long time because it was just too hard a nut to crack, but in\nthe 1930s and 1940s x-ray crystallography started to come into usage where\nbasically you'd bounce x-rays off of a crystal. And then they would refract and you'd\nsee characteristic reflections.\nAnd you could work backwards to figure out what the structure of the crystal was.\nThis had been applied to minerals and a lot of structure, but it hadn't been applied to\nproteins. When people started to look they found there were certain proteins that\ngave characteristic reflections. Keratin, for example. Your hair gives a characteristic\nreflection around 5.4 angstroms. So that suggested that there was a repeating unit\nsomewhere in keratin that had this.\nAnd, again, with artificial peptides sometimes they were able to see these reflections.\nAnd so that was where things stood for a while. And then one of these secondary\nstructures, a very, very important one known as the alpha helix was deduced by\nLinus Pauling. Some of you have heard of him. He was a famous chemist at Caltech.\nHe got the Nobel prize. He also got famous later in his career because he\nchampioned the use of vitamin C to cure every ill known to mankind, including the\ncommon cold.\n\nAlthough there's some merit to what Linus stated, he probably overstated some of\nthose later findings, but his contributions to the underlying chemistry and\nbiochemistry of proteins was amazing. And he was the one that figured out the\nstructure that explained the 5.4 angstrom repeat. And it was kind of an interesting\nstory. He was in Oxford, England. And he got sick. I think it was some time in the\nwinter.\nAnd he got bored reading detective books after a while so he thought he'd try and\nfigure out the structure of proteins that gave rise to this characteristic repeat. So he\nmade a simplifying assumption. He decided he'd forget all the side chains and just\nfocus on this peptide backbone just with the peptide bond. And he was a chemist.\nAnd he knew, what I just told you, that this had a partial double bond character so it\ncouldn't rotate.\nAnd he reasoned that this was held together by, since these things could form\nhydrogen bonds that this was probably forming a hydrogen bond with a carboxyl\ngroup of some other amino acid and this was probably forming a hydrogen bond with\nan amino group of a different amino acid. And so what he did was he made a sort of\nchain like this and he started to pleat it at the alpha carbon, which is the one that\nhas the side chain on it, and was trying to find the structure that would let him do\nthis.\nAnd basically what he found was that if he made a helix that looks something like\nthis, right-handed helix, and he could get a repeat structure that allowed him to form\na hydrogen bond. And the repeating unit was 5.4 angstroms and 3.7, excuse me,\namino acids per turn. And it's a right-handed helix. It's the same sort of thing if\nyou're trying to turn in a screw. It's got that kind of structure.\nAnd this shows you a little movie of an alpha helix. You can see this is just showing\nthe backbone. So this is the part you can look right down the end of it. See how you\ncan look right though? And you can see how the hydrogen bonds are formed by\nturning this thing into this regular structure. And the neat thing about this then is if\nyou put on the side chains, and you can put them on in any order, you can build a\ntremendous amount of diversity even within that helical structure.\nI think I can stop this. I just want to show you one thing, if I can manage to this\nwhen it comes around again. Stop it there. One of the things you can see, now we're\nlooking down the helix. And although you won't recognize the structures of all the\namino acids right away, you may be able to see in this particular one. Here are a\ncouple of aromatic rings off on this side.\nSo this side of the helix wouldn't like to see water, and over here are a bunch of\ncharged and polar amino acids. So you could see how you could build into a helix like\nthat, a surface, one part that wouldn't like to interact with water and another part\nthat would. So that was an extremely important contribution. And there are alpha\nhelices in almost all proteins. They'll be in little chunks coming down an amino acids\nchain.\nBut they'll take up that structure. And, as you can see, it's driven by these hydrogen\nbonds that we've been talking about. There turns out then to be a second type of\nsecondary structure that's important. It's called a beta sheet. And in this case you\ncan either line up two polypeptide chains running in the same orientation, amino to\n\ncarboxyl, amino to carboxyl, or you can run them in opposite orientations, amino to\ncarboxyl, amino to carboxyl in the other way.\nThe latter one is called an anti-parallel beta sheet. And if you line things up this way\nyou'll see you can find hydrogen bonds between the chains like that. So this allows\ntwo things to form in this way and gives a sort of sheet-like structure. Whereas, that\nalpha helix has this tight coil like this. So over here I think we have a movie of a\nbeta sheet. And you'll see again you can build up more than one.\nBecause if you look up here you can see how you are all set up to form more\nhydrogen bonds out in that kind of way. And, as I said, you can do this same trick\nputting the polypeptide chains so they have the same polarity. And so you can\napproximate, look at the structure of most proteins then by depicting them either as\nalpha helices, which you'll see in these diagrams.\nYou've already seen a few in the examples given. They'll look like this. Or a beta\nsheet which are indicated as these flat arrows. So here's a little piece of a protein\nmade up of alpha helix, these beta sheets. What this is, actually, is a piece of the\nBRCA-1 gene. That's the familial susceptibility to breast cancer. The gene that\ncauses that is called BRCA-1.\nAnd it has a special interaction domain called the BRC T domain. This is the\nstructure. And the only point I'm trying to make, it's of a protein that's involved in\npreventing you from getting breast cancer. If you get a mutation in it, or particularly\nin this region, for example, you can end up with an increased susceptibility to breast\ncancer. But what is it? It's an alpha helices beta sheet.\nThere's green fluorescent protein. You've seen that a few times. Maybe now you'll\nrecognize it's mostly made of beta sheets. There's a little bit of alpha helix down\nthere, a little bit right there. And that has the property that we've talked about of\nfluorescing. This is a protein I'll tell you later on that recognizes mismatches in DNA,\nand you get a susceptibility to cancer if it breaks.\nThe only thing you notice here are a lot of alpha helices in it. And hopefully already\nyour eye can begin to pick these out. This is an enzyme. What it does is it's got a\ncatalytic ability to cleave other polypeptide chains. The functions of these don't\nmatter. But you can see once again alpha helices beta sheets. Here's another one. It\nlooks just about the same, alpha helices, beta sheets, except in this case this is the\nhuman gene known as, the protein encoded by human genes called RAS.\nThat's an oncogene. That's a gene that if it mutates in a particular way will cause the\ncell that has that to move a step down the pathway to cancer. So what I've done is\nput up a whole lot of structures that have some alpha helices, some beta sheets. But\nyou can get the idea that you can get very, very different biological activities from\njust depending on how you arrange those.\nOK. So there are a couple of other then forces that I need to tell you about if we're\ngoing to go all the way to understanding the 3-dimensional structure of proteins.\nWhat we can get to from that is alpha helices beta sheets. But you saw there were\nloops, there were other interactions that I haven't accounted for in showing you\nthose 3-dimensional structures. So one of them is ionic bonds.\n\nThis is the third class of force. This is an extreme case of electron sharing where one\natom gets all of the electrons. So aspartate, which I had up on the board, aspartic\nacid looks like that, but under physiological conditions the oxygen will get all the\nelectrons and you'll have a hydrogen on it. And a consequence of that then is that if\nyou have a polypeptide chain that over here has an aspartate and over here has a\nlysine, which is the four methylene groups, and the positively charged thing here,\nyou can get an ionic bond between those two amino acids that can be very far apart\non the polypeptide chain.\nThere may be a lot of amino acids in between, but what they then do is bring these\ntwo points together and hold them like that. The next class of force is kind of tricky.\nYou may have heard of it in chemistry. It's referred to as van der Waals interaction.\nAnd the basis of this, without going into it too much, is even a nonpolar bond -- -\ncan have a transient polarity. And this then induces -- -- a transient polarity in a\nnearby bond.\nAnd it has to be a really nearby bond. So about 0.2 to 0.4 nanometers. Remember,\ncovalent bonds are roughly half that distance or something. So it's got to be a very,\nvery close interaction. It's weak. It's only one-third to one-quarter of a hydrogen\nbond, which you may recall is about one-twentieth of a covalent bond. But there can\nbe many, many of them if the surfaces fit together really, really tightly.\nSo if you have a protein fold, so there's a surface here, and then it folds up in such a\nway that there's a surface here, then you can get a lot of van der Waals interactions\ndown here. Now, I've never had a really good way of explaining this. But today, part\nof these activities of this Hughes Professorship, I've set up some seminars on\nteaching. And I've invited a guy from Berkley named Robert Full who is talking in 68\n180 at 4:00 PM.\nAnd I borrowed some things from him this morning. And we're just going to take a\nquick tour because I want to show you this. He works on, well, he does a lot of\nthings. He works on biomotion and how animals work. But one of the things he\nworks on, let's see if we can get this guy to go here. Oops. How do I figure out how\nto get it to play here? Hang on a second. I just discovered that the PowerPoint is not\nreally terribly effective.\nSo this isn't working as nicely as I would like. OK. Let's try this. Just a minute.\nWhere are we? Here we go. OK. Let's see if I can get this to go. So he studies a\nbunch of things, but he did an undergrad project library studying geckos. And here\nthis is a transparent surface. And he's studying how the geckos climb up and down\nthe thing. And they were making measurements.\nAnd they found they couldn't account for why this was such an efficient organism. It\nused much less energy than most things, so they started looking into how it adhered\nto the surface. It can go up a vertical wall, as you can see here. And so they were\nable to look underneath and they could see, see how it sort of peels off the surface?\nAnd this was a robot that they eventually built that's not using the same molecular\nbases but uses this peeling thing.\nAnd they can get a robot that climbs up a wall. But that's not what we're going to\ntalk about here. We're going to instead, I hope, go back to here. And you can see\nthat all of the geckos have these sort of bizarre toes, and so they started looking to\nsee what the underlying principle of this was. And they saw it has these setae. And\n\nthey got looking in greater detail and blew it up. And then they found that there\nwere, as they started looking there were these little hairs.\nAnd that's a 900-fold magnification. And once they got looking in more detail they\nfound the ends were split so that they were, the very ends are about 200\nnanometers roughly at the end of this. And so a gecko has about a billion of these on\nits feet. And what it turns out it does -- And just to see, here's a human hair. You\nsee how it splits down? Now, this is made of keratin, the molecule I just mentioned\nthat was used, alpha helices, but it's very, very fine.\nAnd what it can do, it can make van der Waals interactions. This is an animal that\nsticks to the wall by van der Waals interactions. And the peeling away allows it to\nbreak those bonds. But, as you can see, they're enormously important. He's got here\na micrograph. They're measuring the force, and the force is just huge. This is the\nend of the thing, the frayed end sticking to a surface.\nAnd for those of you who didn't think biology any relevance to you, Bob was telling\nme about this. They followed up, he's an engineer as well and builds interdisciplinary\nteams, and they've measured this stuff. But this is turning into what appears to look\nlike it's going to be a $30 to $50 billion industry as all sorts of things are -- They're\nbeginning to realize it can hold car parts together, it can go in space shuttles, Post-it\nnotes.\nAnd here's a little Band-Aid they made. They own the patent on this self-cleaning dry\nadhesive. It doesn't have to be made out of gecko stuff. It could be made out of all\nsorts of things. But, anyway, here's an example of where not only are van der Waals\nforces very important, but where somebody who studied a very simply aspect of\nbiology worrying about the efficiency of how geckos ran and pushed it all the way\ndown to the molecular level understood a principal that's going to make somebody a\nvery large amount of money.\nOK. The last, and if anybody wants to come, he's an amazing speaker. Perhaps one\nof the most exciting speakers I've ever heard. 68-180, 4:00 PM if you want to go.\nHe'll have more of that sort of stuff to show you then. OK. So the last force here, it's\nnot really a force, but what we'll call hydrophobic effects. And what I mean by this is\nthat the principle of this is that amino acids that don't like to interact with water, so\n- So hydrophobic amino acids.\nThese are ones like lucine and phenylalanine. Well, I showed you the water the other\nday and how it was forming hydrogen bonds between the molecules. So if you're\ngoing to stick another molecule in there, you're going to break a bunch of bonds.\nAnd if you're not charged or polar you cannot make new bonds with the water. And\nso what happens, if you put these together, just like if you put oil together it will all\nbundle up and it will minimize its interactions with water.\nAnd that's what proteins do. Here's the structure of a protein all folded up in 3\ndimensional space. And you can see at the core of the protein how there are these\nmany hydrophobic amino acids that are interacting. And let me just, I'm going to\nclose by showing you one more little movie. And the new version of PowerPoint\ndoesn't do this well so I'm just going to get out of this for a second here.\nThis is a really cool movie I saw. I want to show you a DNA repair protein sticking to\na piece of helix. Can you hit the lights somebody there? So this is a lesion on a piece\n\nof, see the double helix here? And what I especially liked about this is this is sort of a\nStar Wars movie. You're going to fly down the major groove of a double helix. And\nyou can see where this particular protein folded up in 3-dimensional space is\nreaching down into that helix.\nSo this is sort of putting together the two things that I've been telling you about.\nThis blue is a DNA repair protein. Oopsy daisy. A DNA repair protein that's able to\nfind a lesion in the DNA. And here's the double helix that's the two chains held\ntogether by hydrogen bonds. And then, as you can see, there's a groove on each\nside. And the protein is searching down into that groove -"

Of the rest of it about 50% of what's there by mass is protein.\nProteins do most of the really interesting stuff in the cell. They're the ones that are\nable to catalyze specific chemical reactions with all this amazing chemistry that's\nneeded for life to take place at physiological conditions.\nThey are structural components of the cells. They are all kinds of amazing machines.\nI showed you the little flagellar motor that turns it, but that's just one of many,\nmany nano machines that are necessary for life. They have exquisite specificity when\nyou get sick and you get an immune response. You develop antibodies and other\ncells that are able to recognize exactly some piece of that virus or bacterium that has\ninfected you and mount an immune response.\nBut all of the things that are doing that are proteins. And the sort of, most of you I\nthink know that, as we've sort of said that amino acids are just a chain, one amino\nacid joined to another amino acid to another amino acid and so on. And so the\nbackbone, that peptide bond that I showed the other day is absolutely regular piece\nof backbone.\nAnd what gives the amino acids their character is the side chain that hangs off. And\nyou'll have different side chains hanging off depending on what the amino acid is.\nAnd you will not have to memorize all of those structures. But the important thing is\nthat these various amino acids fit into chemical categories that give them properties.\nThey either have a plus charge and a negative charge, they're hydrophobic, they\ndon't like to go with water, they are polar, they cannot interact with water and so on.\nAnd it's clear from a couple of your comments, some of you are why are we going\nthrough all of this? Well, the reason we're going through all of this is all amino acids\nlook like this. It doesn't matter. They're going to be an enzyme, a part of a motor, a\nstructural part of yourselves. They all consist of the same backbone made up of\nthose 20 amino acids. And what gives these, makes the proteins so important is the\nultimate 3-dimensional structure.\nI'm not sure what this sound is. OK. Let's try standing back here. What gives all of\nthese proteins their individual character is how this chain of amino acids, you could\njust think of them like this, folds up into some 3-dimensional structure that\nultimately is able to do the biological function that we're trying to understand. And\none of the real holy grails still in biology is how to look at the sequence of amino\nacids that constitute a protein and figure out what the 3-dimensional structure is.\nIt's one of the holy grails that hasn't been solved. One of you may have a key insight\nthat will solve this. If we could do that it would really be a huge advance, because\nwhat you can get out of the genome sequences is you can read the sequence of\nevery gene and you can predict the sequence of amino acids in the protein. But all it\ntells you is the linear sequence of the amino acids.\n\nIt doesn't tell you what the 3-dimensional structure is. And how an amino acid gets\nfrom the sort of floppy chain linear structure to the 3-dimensional thing is\ncomplicated. And you have to understand several kinds of forces. And so I\nintroduced a few terms. When we think about protein structure, the primary\nstructure, that's just the linear sequence -- -- of amino acids. So valine followed by a\ntryptophan, followed by a proline, followed a threonine, whatever it would be.\nThat doesn't tell you very much. Then the first key part of understanding how\nproteins get to a 3-dimensional structure was the discovery of what's termed\nsecondary structure. And these are the thing I introduced to you to the other day.\nThere are two important ones. An alpha helix and a beta sheet. And this is a\npropensity of a certain string of amino acids in this linear sequence to adopt one of\ntwo very common protein structures.\nAnd the important thing about these elements, the alpha helices and the beta sheets\nis they are not dependent on the side chain. So they are not. They are instead\ndependent on hydrogen bonds -- -- between N-H and the carbon double bond\noxygen in the backbone. And that was how Linus Pauling figured out originally the\nalpha helix. He decided to ignore all the side chains. And he worked out that you\ncould arrange the backbone of a protein, the peptide bonds into these repeating\nstructures that would account for the reflections he'd seen.\nWhen we get to talking about how Watson and Crick worked out the structure, that's\nhow they started out, too. They decided to ignore, if you will, the side chains, which\nare the As and Gs and Cs and Ts, which turned out to be not a productive way to go\nafter the structure of DNA. But, in any case, that was part of what Linus Pauling did\nin working these out. And so those little movies I showed you, this is an alpha helix.\nNow, what's been done in this picture is all the side chains have been taken off. And\nso you can look at this in your textbook, you'll see pictures, but these hydrogen\nbonds are -- The amino acid is just in this helix. It's coiling around. And at regular\nintervals there's the opportunity for forming a hydrogen bond. And we can, with\nsome success but certainly not certainty, predict that a particular sequence of amino\nacids is going to form an alpha helix.\nAnd part of what that's based on is there are some amino acids that don't fit easily\ninto an alpha helix, so they'll disrupt one if it ever tried to form. So that's one of the\nelements of protein structure. So what you might get from this is the idea that\nsomewhere along here this little piece of the linear sequence is apt to be an alpha\nhelix. And you can represent that as this little sort of coil that you see in these 3\ndimensional structures.\nThe other one, which is the beta sheet, now that involves interactions between two\npieces of, two stretches of amino acids. Maybe there was a loop in between. And\nthen you can get interactions between them. And that, oops. Let me just go, there's\nthe beta sheet interaction. Now, those are represented as arrows. You know, it takes\ntwo of them to go. So you've got to have, to represent a beta sheet in a 3\ndimensional structure you have to have two of those broad arrows.\nAnd there was a question why were there arrows on them? Well, one of the things, I\nthink you can see if you look at those backbones, is that both nucleic acid and\nprotein backbones, there's a polarity. If you start in this direction, the amino\n\nterminus, it's got a particular direction. It's not symmetric. If you come back the\nother way you find carboxyl, amino, the alpha carbon.\nAnd you'll find it in the opposite order if you come back the other way. So there's an\ninherent polarity. The arrows aren't represented on here, but they are when you look\nat it in 3-dimensions. And you can either form beta sheets where the two strands\nhave the same polarity or, if in a case like that where they loop back, then of course\nif this one was pointing in this direction as it goes through the loop then the opposite\nstrand will be pointing in the other polarity, one going this way and one going that\nway.\nSo this part is sort of helpful. You can make guesses that maybe this part has a\ntendency over here to form a beta sheet, but you still haven't gotten very far\ntowards understanding how you get to the 3-dimensional structure. And just by\nputting on and superimposing some amino acids onto that alpha helix then you can\nsee what happens, that if you form an alpha helix what happens is all the side chains\nstick out.\nAnd now I think you can see, those of you who are engineers anyway, if you wanted\nto build something you have a cylinder and you can stick amino acids out that have\nparticular chemical characteristics. And depending on the characteristics of those\namino acids, whether they have charges on them or if they hate water or something,\nthat will influence what happens to that component of the protein structure when it\ngets into a 3-dimensional thing.\nAnd, as I think I showed you the other day, when we caught it looking down the end\non this particular example, here are a couple of aromatic amino acids right here,\nthey're on the same side of the helix and they would hate water. Whereas, some of\nthe other amino acids up here are ones that have charges so those would love water.\nSo what this would look like is a cylinder part of which hated water and part of which\nloved water.\nAnd you might guess it folded up in 3-dimensional space. The part that hated water\nmight fold towards the inside of the protein. And the part of the cylinder that loved\nwater would face to the outside. So that's sort of the underlying principle. So the rest\nof the other forces that we had to understand in order to get to what's called the\ntertiary structure, this is the full 3D structure, which we can now determine by a\nvariety of methods.\nX-ray crystallography of proteins is probably the most common. The NMR, for\nexample, can be used to derive a 3-dimensional structure as well. And the other\nforces then that go into this are ionic forces. Someone seemed confused by this, but\nif you have a plus charge on this part of an amino acid and a minus charge here, if in\n3-dimensional space the plus charge got somewhere near the minus charge then\nthat would form an ionic bond.\nAnd I think most of you know enough electricity and magnetism that wouldn't\nsurprise you that those two would be attracted. The one that I think that has been\nharder to understand is van der Waals interactions that we talked about the other\nday, which is tricky in the sense that for this course you don't particularly really need\nto understand the underlying chemistry.\n\nBut the principal of it is that if you have a nonpolar bond, one that hasn't got any\nparticular attraction to it, gets very, very close to another one, then the transient\nfluctuations in one induce something in the other one that makes them stick\ntogether. And the whole point about this is if you get two molecular surfaces that are\nvery, very close together, about, you know, many two times the length of a covalent\nbond or something, then you can generate very powerful forces.\nBecause even though each individual interaction is weak, about a quarter or a third\nof a hydrogen bond, summing them up can make them very, very strong. And so\nthat's another kind of force that's important when a linear molecule is trying to figure\nout how in space it's going to fold up. The point of the gecko thing was it's only\nrelatively recently been discovered that the reason those lizards can stick to walls is\nthey have sort of incredible split ends.\nI noticed a couple of you came to Bob Full's talk the other day and you got to hear\nthe full treatment. But because the hairs on their feet are so split they're very fine\nand the molecules are able to make very close interactions, van der Waals\ninteractions with the surface. And that's what's holding the gecko to the wall. And\nthere are just so many of them that it can support a whole gecko.\nAnd that's what could be the basis of, he said to me, a $30 to $50 billion adhesive\nindustry, a self-cleaning dry adhesive. And it's not something magic only the gecko\nhair will do. You can design synthetic molecules that have the same property and are\nable to make these millions of van der Waals interactions. So that's two of the other\nthings.\nAnd the final thing, which isn't really a force but goes into this, is this hydrophobic\neffect. And that is that if we have things, amino acids such as valine or something\nthat doesn't like to mix with water, then when the protein folds up, the things that\ndon't like to interact with water will kind of go together just the way if you put a lot\nof oil in the water it will sort of pull together.\nBecause any time you have something that gets stuck in water, it disrupts hydrogen\nbonds and that's energetically unfavorable. So the things that hate water will tend to\nlump together. And you're all used to seeing little drops of oil and stuff floating\naround. And let me switch over to this other thing now. So this was just showing you\none of these protein chains that's folded up into a 3-dimensional structure.\nThis happens to be something with an enzymatic activity. But the important thing for\nright now is what's been colored in here are the amino acids that if you look back on\nthe list of amino acids and what categories are, you'd see some of them are said to\nhave hydrophobic side chains. You can see quite strikingly how the amino acids in\nthe interior part of this protein have clustered together.\nThey don't like to interact with water. They interact very well with each other. Just\nlike you can mix butter and oil, they mix together very well. And so that is another\nfactor that contributes to the 3-dimensional structure of these proteins. So\nunderstanding what proteins are all about means ultimately understanding their 3\ndimensional structure. And, as I say, a big unsolved problem right at the moment is\nhow do you get from a linear chain of amino acids to one of these 3-dimensional\nstructures? And you can imagine with 20 different side chains there's an unbelievable\nnumber of combinations that you can make.\n\nYet almost every protein in nature has one unique or one or two or something\nconfirmations that takes out, out of all the kinds of things that you could do. And it's\nthis combination of forces that does that. You know, let me just go back for one\nsecond. So the final thing that ones talks about when you're talking about proteins\nare quaternary structure. And what that means is when you have more than one\npolypeptide chain, so if we have two different proteins that interact, this is protein\nnumber one and this is protein number two, then there has to be some sort of\ninteraction between each of these three dimensional structures in order for the\nproteins to stick together.\nSomething like that flagellar motor that let's the bacteria swim, has many, many\nparts, all of which have to fit together just the same way all the different parts of an\nengine have to fit together. Now this next little movie is just a dimer. It's actually a\nheterodimer so it's made of two proteins. They're different but they've come\ntogether and they're interaction.\nSo what you will first see is the 3-dimensional structure of each protein showing the\nalpha helices, the beta sheets, and nothing else is shown. The side chains aren't\nshown. The molecular surfaces aren't shown. You can just see the backbone. You'll\nsee alpha helix a turn, some beta sheets, just the kind of stuff you were seeing the\nother day. But you'll see that the two proteins are together.\nAnd this is actually a movie made by Tom Schwartz who's a crystallogram who just\nstarted on our facility this fall in the biology department. It's one of the proteins he\nstudied. And then after that he rotates it around so you can see it. After that he then\nputs on the side chains and then traces the surface. So this is what they call the van\nder Waals surface. So this is what the protein would actually look like.\nAnd what I think you'll see from this is how incredibly well the proteins fit together.\nThe theme I'll probably keep saying all the way through the course is biology works\nfrom fitting shapes. And things have to work incredibly well, and that's also why\nthese van der Waals forces become so important. Because evolution has ended up\nmaking things that just go together just like a hand in a perfectly fit glove.\nThat's the way most of these interactions are. So watch this little movie. So the light\nblue is one of the proteins. There's an alpha helix. There are a lot of alpha helices in\nthis one. And the purple one is the other protein. And you can see that in between\nthem there's an interface. And so those must be interacting. But when he\nsuperimposes now all the amino acids in the surface, now what he's going to do, he's\ngoing to pull those apart so you can see where they were interacting.\nDo you get the idea now of how beautifully these things have folded up in 3\ndimensional space in positions so that they can fit together and work together as a\nmachine? Just the same way if you were building a machine and you needed to have\ntwo parts that you had to join together you've got a tool thing so that the surfaces\ngo exactly together. That's what nature does.\nThat's also why I'm making such a deal out of this 3-dimensioanl structure of\nproteins and how it got there. I could just say it gets there by magic, but it doesn't.\nIt's determined by this set of forces. And one of the things we cannot do at this point\nis predict. Here's a linear sequence of amino acids. Here's the 3D structure. That\nwould be a huge advance in biology if one of you guys could figure out how to do\nthat during your career.\n\nOK. So I just want to reiterate some of the things that proteins do because we'll be\ntalking about them as we go along. One thing they do, they act as enzymes which\nare catalysts for biological reactions that take place under physiological conditions.\nAnd we'll give you a lot of examples of those enzymes starting very soon. They play\nstructural roles.\nOur hair, our fingernails are made of protein. The hairs on the gecko's feet are made\nof keratin which is the same stuff our hair is made of, except they basically got a\nwhole lot of split ends. They're finer hairs to begin with and a lot of split ends. And\nthat's what makes these very, very fine things that can make van der Waals\ninteractions with surfaces. They play roles in specificity.\nFor example, I mentioned the antibodies. And we'll talk about the immune response\nin some detail at the end of the course. And one of the really magic things that we've\ncome to understand in biology recently is how it is that your body has this immune\nsystem that's able to recognize literally any molecule, any molecule. It doesn't\nmatter whether it is existed or you and your PhD thesis in chemistry synthesize\nsomething the world has never seen before, your immune system can create an\nantibody or something that will very, very specifically recognize that particular shape\nin just the same sort of way that you saw the shape on that movie.\nAnd you might think you'd need to code a zillion millions of DNA in order to do that.\nBut there's a trick using combinatorial functions and mutation that lets your body do\nthat. Another example, which I was showing you, that can do all sorts of little motors\nand machines, I showed you the bacteria swimming around. These are just E. coli.\nAnd you cannot see the flagellar motors, but you can see them buzzing around just\nunder a cover slip.\nSome of them are stuck to the cover slip. There we go. In this one, which was taken\nby Howard Burge who is a professor at Harvard, I just took this off his website, you\ncan see the bacteria swimming by having these flagella which are basically like sort\nof propellers more or less that they turn. Here's one where he used the strobe so you\ncan get a little bit better view of it. And I showed you this picture in the first lecture.\nSo that's the machine, but every single part of that machine is made of a protein\nthat's got a very certain 3-dimensional space. And we're going to start talking about\nenergetics, how does this cell get energy? And one of the things you might wonder is\nif you were to design such a nano machine how would you power it? They exist. I\nmean it's here.\nBut that's why in part I'm going to start talking about energy and how cells make\nenergy, because this is one of the things they have to do. And that was, as I said,\nwas an average electron micrograph of a lot of those motors. So you can see that\nalthough, you know, that's the textbook thing, the actual thing is pretty much the\nsame shape. This is not at a resolution where you can make out the individual\nproteins that put it together, but some of those are starting to be known in 3\ndimensional detail.\nAnd I thought you might enjoy seeing this just to convince you it's a motor. In this\nthing, what Howard Burge did was he stuck the propeller, if you will, the flagellar to\na cover slip using an antibody. And then he let them do their thing. And normally\nthey would be turning the propeller and swimming, but if the propeller is attached\n\nthe same thing would happen if you held onto the propeller of a boat and turned on\nthe motor the boat would start twirling around.\nAnd what you're seeing here is bacterial that are twirling around because their\nflagellar are stuck on. And those of you who are observant will notice even that they\nchange direction. And that's part of the system that bacteria use so they can swim\ntowards a food source or away from another one. OK. Here's just something to let\nyou think about it. If anybody can figure this out send me an email.\nHere's something else. The phenomenon I'm going to show you is due to a protein\nmade by a soil bacterium called Pseudomonas syringae. You don't need to know that.\nIt associated with plants. And what you're going to see is a little movie made by a\ncouple of post-docs in my lab where they took pure water. And if it's pure water you\ncan cool it below freezing.\nYou can get it down to, I don't know, minus eight degrees centigrade and it still will\nbe a liquid, even though you know water freezes at zero degrees centigrade. And\nwhat it has to do in order to turn into ice, somewhere you have to nucleate the\nformation of an ice crystal. And once it goes, going. So, anyway, what you're going\nto see is some super- cooled water they've made.\nYou can see there is zero degrees there. And this is Metchitaga, one of the post-docs\nin my lab. That's the super-cooled water. She's taking a little bit of culture of this\nPseudomonas syringae, and she's just going to put it in, give a little tiny squirt, a few\nmicro-liters into that water. Now it's going all cloudy. And now you might wonder\nwhat's happening there. But, as you'll discovery, what happened is that what was\nliquid water is now ice.\nThat is due to one protein that this bacterium makes and displays on its surface. And\nhere's a controlled experiment. This is putting in a little bit of rhizobium meliloti,\nanother soil organism, and the same amount of bacteria. It didn't happen. OK. So\nthat's due to a protein that was on the surface of that bacterium. Anybody have any\nidea what that could do? Send me an email. OK. There's one last class of biological\nmacromolecule.\nThose are lipids. These are a little different in the sense that this is not know a long\nchain made by joining together subunits as you see with the proteins and nucleic\nacids, but putting together the parts necessary to make a lipid involve the same\nprinciple, that you end up splitting out water molecules. That's a theme you've heard\nover and over again. And if we take three long chain, three fatty acids, some number\nof carbons -- Some number of carbons.\nJust some arbitrary number here. And then we take a three carbon compound that\nhas three hydroxyl groups. Now, this is not a carbohydrate because you'll notice\nthere's not a double bond oxygen as you saw in the carbohydrates. It's actually an\nalcohol that's known as glycerol. And if we split out water like this what you get is a\nfat, something you're familiar with from beef fat. Or if you get something like olive\noil, you've heard the term unsaturated fats.\nMaybe you'll recall from the second lecture that if we had a single covalent bond, or\nif we had a double or a triple bond that was called an unsaturated bond. So if you\nhave an unsaturated bond in here somewhere then you end up with an unsaturated\n\nfat. And most of you know probably something like beef fat is solid. If you put it in a\nrefrigerator something like peanut oil will stay liquid.\nAnd that's because if you have just saturated side chains from this then they pack\ntogether very tightly and they will form a solid. If you put a double bond in then\nthere's a kink in the backbone and it's hard for these things to pack together. And\nthat's why they're called unsaturated fats. Now, there's a very particular kind of lipid\nthat's of unbelievable importance in biology known as a phospholipid.\nAnd the reason that's so important is that that is the boundary that determines the\noutside of a cell. So every cell, every organism either is a single cell or is made up of\nmultiple cells. And, as I said in the first lecture, that one of the secrets to life is\nhaving a boundary that goes around your insides it separates your insides from all\nthe rest of the universe.\nAnd the way these membranes, as they're called, are made of is what's known as a\nphospholipid bilayer. And it's the same principle as before. It uses a glycerol, except\nthat one of the fatty acids is replaced by a phosphate group that will have some kind\ndecoration added onto it. And the other will have fatty acids at the other two\npositions. Now, you'll notice by splitting out water here, the kind of bond that we\nhave created, the chemical name of this is an ester bond.\nAnd if we wanted to break it we could add water back across it. So what's important\nabout this molecule is this part of the molecule, if you will, is water-loving because\nthe very polar bonds here, the oxygen here would have a negative charge under\nphysiological conditions. And this part is, if you will, water-hating. So phospholipids\nare often represented in the following way where this is the water-loving and then\nthis would be the water-hating part here.\nAnd so if you take phospholipids and you just try and disperse them in water, they\nspontaneously self-assemble into structures that bring the water-loving parts\ntogether and the water-hating parts together. And by so doing this they form what's\nknown as a phospholipid bilayer. And that's what this membrane is made of.\nMembrane of bacterial cell, membrane of our cells virtually the same thing. It has\nthe property that is not permeable to very much.\nWater can get across a very limited number of other chemical compounds, but most\nthings cannot. And so, by having this membrane, what the cell is able to do then is\ncontrol who comes in and who comes out. And the way it does that is it has to put\nparticular importers or exporters imbedded in the membrane that can carry out\nthose functions. Because, as you would guess, any system would have to bring stuff\nin, get rid of waste, you'd have to be able to go back and forth.\nThe things that do all those transports across the membrane are, what kind of\nmolecule do you think it likely to be? If nature was going to design something that\nwas a pump to get something in or something that would get something out, any\nidea what kind of molecule? Take a guess given what I've said so far. Protein. Yeah.\nAbsolutely. And let me just sort of show you a couple little pictures here.\nSo here's a representation of this phospholipid bilayer. This is pretty standard stuff.\nThis is what you'd put on a blackboard. Here's in gray now the phospholipid. And\nhere's one of these proteins, a picture of one of these proteins that functions to get\nthings across the membrane. And hopefully what you can see now is that it's made\n\nup of a whole lot of alpha helices, and they pack together to give sort of a cylinder\nmade up of different alpha helices that weave in out like this.\nAnd then by this sort of trick the protein is able to create a channel that runs up and\ndown the middle of this protein that's imbedded in the membrane. And then,\ndepending on the characteristics that channel, it can either be used to bring stuff in\nor get rid of it. There is a more fanciful depiction of it. This is not reality, but there\nyou are with the water-loving parts.\nHere are the fatty acids going in. And this is supposed to be one of these membrane\nproteins. Now, this next movie is trying to pretend here that it's looking at one of\nthese membrane proteins colored here in red as it spans the membrane. So here's\nlooking from the membrane surface on. And now it's going to dive into this thing as\nit crossed the membrane.\nAnd basically what this movie is letting you do is feel like if you were the molecule\nthat's being transported across the membrane you'd see how you'd go right down\nthrough a channel in the middle of the protein. So that's one of the underlying\nprincipals then, is that you have a phospholipid boundary that's critical for life. But\nthen to have everything else that needs to happen the cell makes a series of proteins\nthat function either to bring stuff in or to bring it out.\nOr in the case of something like the flagellar motor we talked about it has to imbed a\npart of the machinery right in the membrane. And one last picture I just want to\nshow you. Usually, even on that movie, you tend to see the cell represented\nsomething like this with a membrane and every once in a while there's a protein.\nThis is a cartoon but it is much closer to a to-scale drawing.\nThis is an E. coli cell. Now, they have an extra membrane that we won't worry about\nright for the moment. But right there, this little piece that we can see little bits of, is\nthe cell's membrane. And what this picture is showing is that this membrane is just\nabsolutely studded with membrane proteins that are going to carry out various\nfunctions. And here actually we're seeing that motor which is imbedded both in the\ninner and outer membrane.\nAnd there's the motor going off. But a couple of things maybe you can take home\nfrom this is there are a lot of proteins stuck in those membranes that control what\ngoes in and out. You also get a sense in here of how crowded the cytoplasm is. The\nproteins are really at amazingly high concentrations when they're inside the\ncytoplasm. OK. So that's sort of a quick survey.\nIt's nothing more that a really superficial introduction to the four classes of\nbiomolecules. But to go any farther we're going to have to think a little bit now about\nof the characteristics of living cells. I don't know if any of you know if any of you\nknow what this is, but this is bakers yeast. If you were making bread you know you\nput some yeast in it and it divides and it gives off carbon dioxide as a waste product\nand makes the bread rise.\nAnd what's happened in that little movie you just saw were two cells dividing to give\nfour, and four dividing to get eight, and I don't know what we're up to here, but you\ncan see a cell grow. That's sped up. It takes probably something closer to an hour\nfor a cell division to take place. But this is the kind of thing that microorganisms do\n\nwhen they grow, is you can start with a single cell and it will make two cells that are\nidentical to itself and those will make four.\nAnd what happens when we start out as a single cell, we start out initially like this.\nAnd we make cells that are identical at the beginning. And those are the famous\nembryonic stem cells, because at this point they can become any cell in your body.\nAnd if you're a yeast it doesn't matter. Everything you make is the same. If it's a\nhuman, once you start dividing at some point cells are going to have to start making\ndecisions and the progeny will have to start to be different of each other so that you\ncan have something that's an eye and another cell that's in the liver and so on.\nAnd we'll talk a little bit about that as we go on. But the major point, right at this\npoint, is that all of life involves one cell dividing and giving a couple of other cells,\nand then those going on. So these cells, as we've said, characteristics of organisms\nwhich are to be true at their cellular level as well is that they carry out metabolism,\nthey undergo regulated growth.\nAnd you have a nice example of yeast undergoing regulated growth and they\nreproduce, which in the case of a single-celled organism is the same as cell division.\nFor us reproducing is a lot more complicated because we have to make a whole other\nmulticellular organism where the cells have differentiated functions, but the point\nabout that is there has to be an unbelievable amount of synthesis.\nThe DNA in our body, we start out with two meters in a fertilized cell, and we have\nten to the fourteenth cells by the time we're an adult. So we've had to make a\ntremendous amount of DNA let alone protein and everything else. And something\nalmost all of you know from your engineering background from this place is that you\nneed energy in order to synthesize material.\nAnd what we'll start to talk about in the next phase of this course then is how do\ncells make energy and how do they carry out metabolism. So I'm going to, just\nbefore we do that, introduce to you very quickly, to close out here, two classes of\norganisms that we find in nature. We find organisms that are known as autotrophs.\nThese are certain bacteria, and they're able to make everything they need starting\nwith CO2, ammonia, phosphate, water, a few things, but that's all they need.\nSo, for example, an organism that lives, a bacterium that lives out in the open ocean\nis able to make everything from those very, very simple basic building blocks.\nHeterotrophs need to eat -- -- some things made by other organisms. An example of\na heterotroph that you're familiar with, that I'm familiar with is us. You probably\nremember your mother reminding you, as you're about to have yet another hotdog,\nthat it was important to eat your vitamins.\nThe reason you need to eat vitamins, those are things we absolutely need for our life\nbut we cannot make them ourselves. Vitamin C is one you probably know. It has an\ninteresting history how people figured this out. It was sailors at sea got really, really\nsick. Their teeth would start to loosen, they would start to bleed and they would die.\nSome of the famous sea voyages you heard about in high school, I think the Cape of\nGood Hope, on that trip where that was discovered 100 out of the 160 sailors died at\nsea because of scurvy.\nNow, scurvy turns out to be due to not having vitamin C. And there was finally a\nguy, Lind, I'm just blanking on his first name at the moment, in about the 1700s who\n\nwas a naval surgeon in the British Navy who actually figured out that if you gave\nsailors lemon juice that they didn't get scurvy. It was a controlled experiment. It\ntook about 50 years. I think it was 1795 when they started to finally give the sailors\nlemon juice and stopped having this terrible sickness amongst their sailors.\nAnd then in about 1950 they substituted lime juice. And some of you may still know\nthe British sailors are called \"limeys\". And that was because of this solution they\nfound to avoiding scurvy. And what was really happening was they were finding a\nway to provide vitamin C which is in fresh fruits and vegetables which wasn't part of\nthe classic sailor diet which was sort of biscuits and dried meat during long voyages\nat sea.\nAnd there are several other vitamins, but the reason they're called vitamins is\nthey're things that you body cannot make but other organisms can. The other thing\nthat we cannot make, we can make some of our 20 amino acids, but there are eight\namino acids that we cannot make, lysine, methionine, lucien, isoleucine, valine,\nthreonine, phenylalanine and tryptophan. And this actually has consequences for us\nbecause those of you who are vegetarians probably know you have to be kind of\ncareful about your diet.\nIf you're eating animal protein you're getting essentially all the different amino acids,\nbut if you're a vegetarian you have to be careful because the major food crops such\nas wheat and rice, for example, are very low in lysine. So if you just eat those you\nend up with a lysine deficiency that's not good. But, on the other hand, beans,\nlentils, the various leguminous plants, which also are those ones that form the\nspecial associations with bacteria that let them convert atmospheric nitrogen into\nammonia, legumes are high in lysine but low in methionine.\nSo peoples all over the world figured this out by trial and error. So the Mexican diet\nis rice and beans. There's a reason for it. What's happening actually is just in the rice\nyou're low in lysine, but by having beans at the same time you're balancing out the\ntwo. Or the Native Americans in this pat of the country had \"the three sisters\" with\nthe corn, the squash and the beans.\nAnd again they were balancing out the diet by making sure that they got the various\namino acids, a balance of all the amino acids that were necessary for life. It also\nactually was really good gardening practice because the beans were able to convert\natmospheric nitrogen into ammonia, which was fertilizer, and the squash leaves\nshaded the ground so that the ground didn't dry out, and the corn could grow even\nwhen it was short on water.\nBut what was really happening, as people grew without even understanding about\nchemistry, they were compensating for the fact that we're heterotrophs and needed\nto do this. So we'll start in the next lecture on trying to talk about how cells make\nenergy and how it makes some of this amazing stuff happen."

Problem sets will not be accepted late.\nSolutions will be posted on the web.\nPlease read the following two articles and use them to answer Question 1.\nArticle I\nFouad, Tamer. \"Laptops can affect fertility in males, US researchers warn.\"\n(January 1, 2005).\n(full text at http://www.thedoctorslounge.net/fertilounge/articles/fertility_laptops)\nPlease refer to article:\n\nArticle II\nMoore, Charles. \"Hot Laptops A Male Reproductive Health Hazard - And Something\nYou Can Do About It.\" Road Warrior, January 4, 2005.\n(full text with pictures at http://www.macopinion.com/columns/roadwarrior/05/01/04/ )\nPlease refer to article:\n\nQuestion 1\na) Do the articles above present the findings of the laptop study objectively? If yes, justify. If no,\ngive examples of biased reporting and explain why you believe the reporting to be biased. (Feel\nfree to underline or highlight passages in the text, as long as you clearly identify the meaning of\nyour markings)\nb) Look again at the second article. Does the Laptop Desk study answer the question of how\nlikely is it that this device would help alleviate the problem of the elevated scrotum temperature\nassociated with laptop use? Why or why not?\nc) Based on the information in the two articles, do you think the Laptop Desk is likely to be a\nsignificant relief for the problem of the elevated scrotum temperature associated with laptop use?\nWhy or why not?\nd) Based on the information in the two articles, do you think it was appropriate to include the\ninformation about the Laptop Desk in the second article? Why or why not?\n\nQuestion 2\nHemoglobin is the protein complex that carries oxygen around our bodies and distributes it to the\norgans and tissues. Sickle cell anemia is a disease that results from the presence of abnormal\nhemoglobin (HbS) in the red blood cells. In order to have the disease a person needs to have only\nHbS hemoglobin.\nWild-type hemoglobin (HbA) is composed of 2 α and 2 β polypeptides. The α and β polypeptides\nare approximately the same length, and are very similar in their primary structure.\na) If you run HbA on a denaturing gel, how many bands are you likely to see? Why?\nWhen mutant HbS and wild-type HbA hemoglobin molecules are analyzed on a denaturing gel,\nthey produce identical patterns.\nb) What is the likely defect in the HbS? Why?\nAt low concentrations of O2 HbS forms rigid rod-like complexes in the cell. These complexes\ndeform the red blood cells from saucer shape to sickle-like shape. These rigid, sickle-like cells can\nget stuck in the small blood vessels and cause damage.\nThe β-subunit of HbS has the amino acid valine in position 6, where the wild-type molecule has a\nglutamic acid.\n- At normal oxygen concentrations, the overall shape of the β-subunit and the entire\nhemoglobin molecule remains unaffected by the substitution.\n- At low concentrations of O2, the Val6 on one β-subunit interacts with two amino acids on a\nβ-subunit of another hemoglobin molecule.\nc) What level(s) of protein structure of the β-subunit is (are) affected by the substitution at normal\noxygen concentrations? Why?\nd) What level(s) of protein structure of the β-subunit is (are) affected by the substitution at low\noxygen concentrations? Why?\nAt low concentrations of O2 the Val6 on the mutant β-subunit interacts with a surface pocket made\nup of amino acids Phe85 and Leu88. This pocket is found on both wildtype and mutant β-subunits.\ne) What is the strongest interaction involved in this binding event?\n\nQuestion 2, continued\nf) This pocket is found on both wild-type and mutant β-subunits. Explain why (at low\nconcentrations of O2) hemogloblin containing only mutant β-subunits forms long rods yet\nhemogloblin containing wild-type β-subunits does not.\ng) The hemoglobin of a person who has both HbA and HbS does not form long rods and thus\ndoes not exhibit sickle-cell symptoms. Explain in terms of molecular interactions why the red\nblood cells of such a person are not deformed.\nQuestion 3\nIn order for a substance to boil, the kinetic energy of the molecules must exceed the energy of the\nforces between the molecules. For each pair of compounds listed below, explain the difference in\nthe boiling in terms of the intermolecular forces.\nCompound\nmethane (CH4)\nmethanol (H3COH)\nwater (H2O)\nsodium chloride (NaCl)\ndiamond*\n*Cn: a covalently-bonded lattice\nBoiling Point (oC)\n-161\ndecomposes without boiling (in vacuum)\na) methane vs. methanol\nb) methanol vs. water\nc) water vs. sodium chloride\nd) sodium chloride vs. diamond\n\nQuestion 4\nIn the past thirteen months, NASA has successfully landed spacecraft on the planet Mars and on\nTitan, one of the moons of Saturn. One of the goals of each mission was to look for evidence of\nwater. Different evidence of the past or present existence of water was found on both Mars and\nTitan. Neither Mars nor Titan has oxygen-containing atmosphere.\na) Scientists are not concerned with the absence of oxygen in the atmosphere, but instead view\nwater as a sign of the possible existence of microbial life. Given what we know about the history\nof life on Earth, why is water regarded as a much more important sign of possible life than\noxygen?\nThe evidence found on the surface of Mars is consistent with a number of scenarios. One is that\nthe surface of the planet once contained oceans, rivers, and lakes. However, currently the\natmosphere on Mars is too thin to allow these bodies of water to remain on the surface.\nb) Assume that these bodies of water once contained living organisms. Provide two alternative\nhypotheses for how a planet might move from having a thick atmosphere over the surface with\nbodies of water containing living organisms to having a thin atmosphere over the dry surface with\nno detectable living organisms.\nNASA scientists describe Titan as an extraordinary world where Earth-like geophysical processes\noperate on exotic materials in very alien conditions.

      "content": "MIT Department of Biology\n7.014 Introductory Biology, Spring 2005\nSolutions to 7.014 Problem Set 1\nQuestion 1\nPlease read the following two articles, and answer the questions at the end\nArticle I\nFouad, Tamer. \"Laptops can affect fertility in males, US researchers warn.\"\n(January 1, 2005).\n(full text at http://www.thedoctorslounge.net/fertilounge/articles/fertility_laptops)\nPlease refer to article:\n\nArticle II\nMoore, Charles. \"Hot Laptops A Male Reproductive Health Hazard - And Something\nYou Can Do About It.\" Road Warrior, January 4, 2005.\n(full text with pictures at http://www.macopinion.com/columns/roadwarrior/05/01/04/ )\nPlease refer to article:\n\nQuestion 1\na) Do the articles above present the findings of the laptop study objectively? If yes, justify. If no,\ngive examples of biased reporting and explain why you believe the reporting to be biased. (Feel free\nto underline or highlight passages in the text, as long as you clearly identify the meaning of your\nmarkings)\nThe first article presents the findings objectively. The article describes procedure used in the study in great\ndetail, and its report on the study's conclusions is limited to those supported by the reported data. Article also\nrelies heavily on direct quotes from the lead author of the study, ensuring a large degree of impartiality. The\nsecond article, on the other hand, overstates the reported results of the study to a large degree. For example,\ncompare the quote highlighted in dark blue in the first article with the one highlighted in light blue in the\nsecond. While the first article merely reports elevated scrotum temperatures observed in the experiment, the\nsecond article makes a connection to reduced sperm production and fertility. This connection is not\nsubstantiated by data obtained in this experiment, or by an applicable previously reported experiment.\nSimilarly, compare quotes highlighted in green and yellow. Notice the use of \"may want to\" in the first article\nvs \"should\" in the second, and the truncated quote in the second article with respect to the first.\nb) Look again at the second article. Does the Laptop Desk study answer the question of how likely\nis it that this device would help alleviate the problem of the elevated scrotum temperature associated\nwith laptop use? Why or why not?\nReporting of the Laptop Desk study talks only about measuring the temperatures on the device itself. It gives\nno indication that the study involved measuring how effective the product would be in alleviating the problem\nof the elevated scrotum temperature associated with laptop use. To determine that, one would need to conduct a\nstudy where the scrotum temperatures were measured when using the Laptop Desk in various configurations\nwith and without a working laptop computer.\nc) Based on the information in the two articles, do you think the Laptop Desk is likely to be a\nsignificant relief for the problem of the elevated scrotum temperature associated with laptop use?\nWhy or why not?\nIt is unclear from the data. The claim of the article is that the product would help alleviate the problem of\nelevated scrotum temperatures by giving the user an option to sit with his legs open. It does not, however,\nmeasure what the scrotum temperature would be in such a configuration. A reasonable hypothesis might be\nthat scrotum temperature would still be elevated due to the partially enclosed space and heat coming from the\ncomputer.\nAdditionally, in the part of the article that did not make the excerpt presented here, there is data that shows\nonly an 8-10% reduction in temperature on the bottom of the Laptop Desk with respect to the laptop itself.\nGiven this modest decrease, even in their best case scenario, it is unlikely that the device would help alleviate\nthe problem of elevated scrotum temperatures associated with laptop use.\nd) Based on the information in the two articles, do you think it was appropriate to include the\ninformation about the Laptop Desk in the second article? Why or why not?\nIt was inappropriate to include the information about the Laptop Desk in the second article. First, as discussed\nin part a, the author of the article exaggerates the conclusions of the study to make the link to possible fertility\nproblems seem more definite than it is so far. Second, the author deceptively uses only the first half of the quote\nby Dr. Sheynkin \"It's possible that external protective devices could help,\" but leaves out qualification\n\"somewhat\" and the part of the quote that talks about the need to first determine their protective effect in a\nclinical trial. He uses the quote as the jumping off point to advertise the Laptop Desk, even though it is has\nnever been clinically tested to illustrate its effectiveness as a means of reducing elevating scrotum\ntemperatures with laptop use.\n\nQuestion 2\nHemoglobin is the protein complex that carries oxygen around our bodies and distributes it to the\norgans and tissues. Sickle cell anemia is a disease which results from the presence of abnormal\nhemoglobin (HbS) in the red blood cells. In order to have the disease a person needs to have only\nHbS hemoglobin.\nWild-type hemoglobin (HbA) is composed of 2 α and 2 β subunits. The α and β polypeptides are\napproximately the same length, and are very similar in their primary structure.\na) If you run HbA on a denaturing gel, how many bands are you likely to see? Why?\nYou are most likely to only see one band, since on the denaturing gel the small difference in size between the α\nand β subunits (4 amino acids) is unlikely to be detected. However, it is possible to use a set of conditions that\nwould differentiate between bands 4 amino acids apart. If these conditions are used, you will see two bands.\nWhen mutant HbS and wild-type HbA hemoglobin molecules are analyzed on a denaturing gel, they\nproduce identical patterns.\nb) What is the likely defect in the HbS? Why?\nIf the patterns are identical, then the problem with the mutant protein is not due to the loss or gain of a major\nportion of a protein. Therefore, the likely defect in HbS is an amino acid substitution.\nAt low concentrations of O2 HbS forms rigid rod-like complexes in the cell. These complexes deform\nthe red blood cells from saucer shape to sickle-like shape. These rigid, sickle-like cells can get stuck in\nthe small blood vessels and cause damage.\nThe β-subunit of HbS has amino acid valine in position 6, where the wild-type molecule has a\nglutamic acid.\n- At normal oxygen concentrations, the overall shape of the β-subunit and the entire\nhemoglobin molecule remains unaffected by the substitution.\n- At low concentrations of O2, the Val6 on one β-subunit interacts with two amino acids on a β-\nsubunit of another hemoglobin molecule.\nc) What level(s) of protein structure of the β-subunit is (are) affected by the substitution at normal\noxygen concentrations? Why?\nAt normal oxygen concentrations, the shape of the mutant subunit and the entire molecule are unaffected by\nthe substitutions. Thus, only the primary structure of the β-subunit is affected. Since valine and glutamic acid\nhave different shapes, it could also be said that there is a small local effect on the tertiary structure.\nd) What level(s) of protein structure of the β-subunit is (are) affected by the substitution at low\noxygen concentrations? Why?\nAt low oxygen concentrations, primary structure is affected, as above. However, a mutant subunit is involved\nin additional inter-molecular interaction, so the quarternary structure is affected as well.\nAt low concentrations of O2, the Val6 on the mutant _-subunit interacts with a surface pocket made\nup of amino acids Phe85 and Leu88. This pocket is found on both wild type and mutant β-subunits.\ne) What is the strongest interaction involved in this binding event?\nPhenylalanin, leucine, and valine are all hydrophobic residues, so the strongest interaction is hydrophobic\ninteraction.\n\nf) This pocket is found on both wild-type and mutant β-subunits. Explain why (at low\nconcentrations of O2) hemoglobin containing only mutant β-subunits forms long rods yet\nhemoglobin containing wild-type β-subunits does not.\nIf we consider three molecules of HbS, A, B, and C. Val6 of molecule A can bind Phe85 and Leu88 of molecule\nB, while Val6 of molecule B can bind Phe85 and Leu88 of molecule C. We can see by extension that HbS can\nform long chains with these interactions. Wild-type β-subunits can provide a Phe85, Leu 88 pocket for binding\nwith mutant subunits, but they do not have Val6 and can not bind the next subunit to form a chain. Therefore,\nincorporating a wild-type subunit into a growing chain terminates the chain. HbA can not aggregate at all.\ng) A person who has both HbA and HbS is a carrier of the disease, but does not exhibit symptoms.\nPlease explain in terms of molecular interactions why a carrier does not exhibit symptoms of the\ndisease.\nA carrier has both wild-type and mutant β-subunits, and, therefore, has both HbA and HbS, as well as\nmolecules containing one wild-type and one mutant β-subunit. As discussed above, whenever a hemoglobin\nmolecule gets incorporated into a growing chain via the hydrophobic pocket on a wild-type subunit, the chain\nterminates. With both types of β-subunit in the red blood cells, the probability of forming a sufficient number of\nlong enough chains to actually deform the cell and cause the person to exhibit symptoms of the disease is low.\nQuestion 3\nIn order for a substance to boil, the kinetic energy of the molecules must exceed the energy of the\nforces between the molecules. For each pair of compounds listed below, explain the difference in the\nboiling in terms of the intermolecular forces.\nCompound\nBoiling Point (oC)\nmethane (CH4)\n-161\nmethanol (H3COH)\nwater (H2O)\nsodium chloride (NaCl)\ndiamond*\ndecomposes without boiling (in vacuum)\n*Cn: a covalently-bonded lattice\na) methane vs. methanol\nMethane is a non-polar molecule, and therefore the only forces preventing methane from boiling are the van der\nWaals forces between the molecules. Methanol is a more polar molecule which can form hydrogen bonds\nbetween molecules. Hydrogen bonds are much stronger than van der Waals bonds, so methanol will have a\nmuch higher boiling point than methane.\nb) methanol vs. water\nLike methanol, water is a polar molecule, and can form hydrogen bonds with other molecules. Because water has\ntwo hydrogen atoms available for hydrogen bonding, it can form more hydrogen bonds per molecule and\ntherefore will be more tightly bound to its neighbors. Therefore, it will require more energy to vaporize water\nthen methanol. Water will have a higher boiling point than methanol.\nc) water vs. sodium chloride\nThe hydrogen bonds in water are due to partially ionized groups (strong dipoles) attracting each other. The\nNa+ and Cl- ions in NaCl are held together by interactions between fully charged ions. Since the attractive\nforce in both cases is due to the Coulomb force, which is proportional to the magnitude of the charges involved,\nthe ionic bonds in NaCl will be stronger than the hydrogen bonds in water.\nd) sodium chloride vs. diamond\nSince a diamond is really one big molecule, its boiling point will be determined by the energy required to break\nthe bonds between the atoms in the diamond lattice. Since these bonds are covalent, the strongest bonds\nknown, diamond will have the highest boiling point. In order for diamond to boil, it must first break down into\nfree carbon atoms - so, strictly speaking, diamond does not boil (it does not become gaseous diamond like\nmethane becomes gaseous methane), but decomposes.\n\nQuestion 4\nIn the past thirteen months, NASA has successfully landed spacecraft on the planet Mars and on\nTitan, one of the moons of Saturn. One of the goals of each mission was to look for evidence of\nwater. Different evidence of the past or present existence of water was found on both Mars and\nTitan. Neither Mars nor Titan has oxygen-containing atmosphere.\na) Scientists are not concerned with the absence of oxygen in the atmosphere, but instead view water\nas a sign of the possible existence of microbial life. Given what we know about the history of life on\nEarth, why is water regarded as a much more important sign of possible life than oxygen?\nWater forms hydrogen bonds, and can form those with other molecules. These hydrogen bonds can be used as\npart of molecule stabilization or reaction mechanism. In addition, if some useful compound is being produced\nabiotically or is excreted as part of some organism's life cycle, the compound would diffuse throughout the body\nof water. This diffusion would ensure that primitive organisms would receive all the available nutrients from\nthe environment. On the other hand, we know that oxygen only appeared on Earth as a waste product of\nphotosynthesis II, so it was not essential to development of life on Earth, although it was key in increasing its\ndiversity and complexity.\nThe evidence found on the surface of Mars is consistent with a number of scenarios. One is that the\nsurface of the planet once contained oceans, rivers, and lakes. However, currently the atmosphere\non Mars is too thin to allow these bodies of water to remain on the surface.\nb) Assume that these bodies of water once contained living organisms. Provide two alternative\nhypotheses for how a planet might move from having a thick atmosphere over the surface with\nbodies of water containing living organisms to having a thin atmosphere over the dry surface with\nno detectable living organisms.\n(1) Some external development caused the atmosphere to become thin. The thin atmosphere then caused the\nchange in the environment that caused the bodies of water to dry up and the organisms to disappear from the\nsurface.\n(2) Organisms on the surface developed some form of metabolism that resulted in a waste product that escaped\ninto the atmosphere and caused it to become thin. The thin atmosphere then caused the change in the\nenvironment that caused the bodies of water to dry up and the organisms to disappear from the surface.\nNASA scientists describe Titan as an extraordinary world where Earth-like geophysical processes\noperate on exotic materials in very alien conditions. Instead of liquid water, there is liquid methane\n(temperature on Titan is sub -170°C); instead of silicate rocks, there is frozen water ice; instead of dirt,\nthere are hydrocarbon particles; and instead of lava, Titan's volcanoes spew very cold ice.\nc) We have no idea what life on Titan might look like. However, if we are to find a living organism\non Titan, it will have the following three properties:\nmetabolism, controlled/regulated growth, reproduction.\nd) Assume that life is found on Titan and that these organisms live in an environment where energy\nis freely available from abiotic sources. If in the future, the energy from abiotic sources becomes\nlimiting, what feature would be common in the organisms that would survive and thrive through\nsuch a transition? Why?\nIf energy from abiotic sources become limiting, organisms that can produce their own energy would have\nselective advantage, since they could grow and replicate regardless of the abundance of abiotic energy in the\nenvironment. Such organisms, then, would survive and thrive through a transition to the environment with\nlimited sources of energy from abiotic sources."

Why?\nII. We will now look at some interactions important in maintaining the tertiary structure of HγD-\nCrys.\nd) Choose \"Central Interaction\"\ni. What are the names of the amino acids involved in this interaction?

HγD crystallin protein is known to be involved in cataract formation in the eye. Cataracts form\nwhen several proteins in the eye bond to one another to create a very large insoluble multi-protein\ncomplex.\nThere is a point mutation that changes the arginine normally found at position 14 to a cysteine.\nChildren with this mutation develop cataracts. The overall 3-D structure of the protein remains\nthe same despite this substitution.\nBoth in the wild type and this mutant version of the HγD crystallin protein there is also a cysteine\nat position 110. Click on the button labeled \"Residues 14 and 110\" to see the location of these two\namino acids.\nf) Are the amino acids at positions 14 and 110 found in the inside or on the outside of the HγD-\nCrys structure?\ng) Consider two molecules of mutant HγD crystallin protein. Recall that these molecules would\nhave cysteine residues in both positions 14 and 110. What type of interaction could form between\nthese two molecules?\nh) How could interaction in part g above lead to the development of a cataract?\n\nQuestion 2\nThe enzyme Phosphofructokinase (PFK) catalyzes the conversion of fructose 6-phosphate (F6P) to\nfructose 1, 6-bisphosphate (FBP), in step 3 of glycolysis.\nphosphofructokinase\nfructose 6-phosphate + ATP\nfructose 1,6-bisphosphate + ADP\n∆Go = -3. 4 kcal\nmol\na) What two functions does ATP serve in this coupled reaction?\nb) Draw and label an energy diagram for this reaction.

It makes up roughly 50% of the protein content of chloroplasts. Rubisco catalyzes the\naddition of one molecule of CO2 to a five carbon sugar ribulose 1,5-biphosphate. The resulting six-\ncarbon sugar is unstable, and splits into two molecules of 3-phosphoglyceric acid.\na) You happen to have some 14CO2 around your lab, so you decide to place your favorite fichus\ninto a large hermetically sealed container, and pump some 14CO2 into the container to mix with\nregular atmosphere already in there. After some time, you move the fichus to a non-radioactive\nenvironment. A quick read with a Geiger counter reveals that the plant is now slightly\nradioactive.\ni. If you moved the plant after 1 minute, and analyzed the cells immediately, where\nwould you expect to find radioactivity? Circle all that apply:\nEvenly distributed throughout the cell\ncarbohydrates\nMostly in the chloroplasts\n\nnucleic acids\nMostly in the nucleus\nproteins\nMostly in the mitochondria\nlipids\nii. If you moved the plant after 1 minute and analyzed the cells the next day, would your\nanswer change? Why or why not?\niii. If you moved the plant the next day, where would you expect to find radioactivity in a\nfichus leaf cell? Circle all that apply:\nEvenly distributed throughout the cell\ncarbohydrates\nMostly in the chloroplasts\n\nnucleic acids\n\nMostly in the nucleus\nproteins\n\nMostly in the mitochondria\nlipids\nJustify your answer(s)\n\nQuestion 4, continued\niv. You dream that your pet goat eats your experimental plant. In such a scenario, where\nwould you now find 14CO2?\nRubisco is a very inefficient enzyme--it only processes about three CO2 molecules per second.\nInside a plant chloroplast it forms large complexes with eight active sites in each. The complex\ndoes not appear to be allosterically regulated--each subunit appears to be very rigid, and each\nactive site operates independently from all other active sites in the complex.

      "content": "MIT Department of Biology\n7.014 Introductory Biology, Spring 2005\nName:______________________________________\nSection :______\n7.014 Problem Set 2\nAnswers to this problem set are to be turned in. Problem sets will not be accepted late.\nSolutions will be posted on the web.\nQuestion 1\nOpen the Human γD crystallin (HγD-Crys) structure html file by clicking on the link on the\nProblem Sets page. Rotate the molecule and get an idea of the three dimensional structure of\n(HγD-Crys). HγD-Crys is a soluble human eye lens protein.\nI. The true 3-dimensional structure of HγD-Crys can be observed using the \"Show Spacefill\"\nbutton, and a trace of the peptide backbone can be observed using the \"Show Ribbon\" button.\na) If possible/applicable, describe the following types of structural features of HγD-Crys:\ni. Secondary:\nThe secondary structure is described as α-helical or β-sheet. Secondary structure is\ncontrolled by backbone hydrogen bonds between amino acids. HγD-Crys is primarily β-\nsheet, but has two small α-helices; one at the top of each domain.\nii. Quaternary (Hint: Use the \"Color Ribbon by Protein Subunit\" button):\nThe quaternary structure of a protein created by a number of distinct interacting amino acid\nchains. If we color HγD-Crys by chain we find there is only one amino acid chain and,\ntherefore, no quaternary structure. There are two β-sheet domains in the protein, but they are\nboth from one amino acid chain.\nb) Does there appear to be a gap between the two protein domains in the ribbon and spacefill\nstructure representations?\nRibbon: Yes\nSpacefill: No\nc) Which of the two representations (spacefill or ribbon) more accurately represents the actual\nstructure of HγD-Crys in the cell? Why?\nThe spacefill model is a more accurate representation of what HγD-Crys looks like in the cell. The\nspacefill representation shows the van der Waal radius or electron density clouds of all non-hydrogen\natoms in the protein. The ribbon structure simply shows a trace of the polypeptide backbone without\nshowing any amino acid side chain atoms.\nII. We will now look at some interactions important in maintaining the tertiary structure of HγD-\nCrys.\nd) Choose \"Central Interaction\"\ni. What are the names of the amino acids involved in this interaction? (Hint: It may help to\nchange the representation of the residues to ball and stick by clicking in the box labeled\n\"Ball and Stick on/off\" below the 3D window. Keep in mind that in cpk coloring, gray\nis carbon, blue is nitrogen, and red is oxygen. Hydrogen is not shown!)\nThe interaction involves a methionine, a phenylalanine, two valines, an isoleucine, and a leucine.\n\nQuestion 1, continued\nii. The central cluster is composed of what type of amino acids (acidic, basic, hydrophobic,\nor polar)?\nAll of the residues are hydrophobic amino acids.\niii. What type(s) of interaction(s) are formed between residues in this cluster?\nAll of the amino acids form a hydrophobic cluster and, therefore, are involved in hydrophobic interactions.\niv. Select \"Central Interaction with All Atoms Shown.\" This view shows all the atoms of\nHγD-Crys (not including hydrogens) as transparent dots. Is the central interaction located\non the inside or the outside of the protein? Why is this reasonable given that HγD-Crys is a\nsoluble protein?\nThese amino acids are primarily found on the interior of HγD-Crys. There are a few areas that are solvent\nexposed, but most of the cluster is shielded from solvent. It is energetically favorable for this cluster to be\nburied from a hydrophilic solvent like the cytoplasm or water because it the amino acid side chains are\nhydrophobic and like nonpolar environments .\ne) Choose \"Interaction I\"\ni. What are the names of the amino acids involved in this inter-domain interaction?\nThere is an arginine and a glutamine residue in this interaction.\nii. What types of amino acids are involved in this interaction (acidic, basic, hydrophobic, or\npolar)?\nGlutamine is a polar residue, while arginine is basic.\niii. What type(s) of bonding interaction(s) are found between these two residues?\nThese residues interact via a hydrogen bond.\niv. Based on the 3-D structure of amino acid pairs, what parts of the amino acid are\ninvolved in forming this interaction (circle the correct answer)?\nOnly the amino acid side chains\nOnly the amino acid backbones\nBoth the amino acid side chains and backbones\n\nQuestion 1, continued\nv. What one amino acid substitution could make this interaction stronger? What one\namino acid substitution could make this interaction weaker? Justify your answer in each\ncase.\nSubstituting glutamic acid for glutamine would make the interaction stronger. Glutamine and glutamic\nacid have very similar size and shape, and glutamic acid and arginine would then make an ionic bond,\nthat is stronger than the hydrogen bond that the glutamine and arginine make.\nSubstituting phenylalanine for arginine would make the interaction weaker. Phenylalanine is a large\nnonpolar amino acid that would only be able to interact with glutamine by van der Waals bonds, a bond\nthat is weaker than the hydrogen bond that the glutamine and arginine make. Although phenylalanine\nand arginine are both large amino acids, their shapes are not too similar. However, since the interaction\nin question is happening on the outside of the protein, the shape differences will likely not play a\nsignificant role.\nIII. HγD crystallin protein is known to be involved in cataract formation in the eye. Cataracts form\nwhen several proteins in the eye bond to one another to create a very large insoluble multi-protein\ncomplex.\nThere is a point mutation that changes the arginine normally found at position 14 to a cysteine.\nChildren with this mutation develop cataracts. The overall 3-D structure of the protein remains\nthe same despite this substitution.\nBoth in the wild type and this mutant version of the HγD crystallin protein there is also a cysteine\nat position 110. Click on the button labeled \"Residues 14 and 110\" to see the location of these two\namino acids.\nf) Are the amino acids at positions 14 and 110 found in the inside or on the outside of the HγD-\nCrys structure?\nThey are found on the outside, solvent-exposed surface of the protein.\ng) Consider two molecules of mutant HγD crystallin protein. Recall that these molecules would\nhave cysteine residues in both positions 14 and 110. What type of interaction could form between\nthese two molecules?\nA disulfide bond could form between two nearby mutated crystallin molecules.\nh) How could interaction in part g above lead to the development of a cataract?\nThe cysteine at position 14 in crystallin molecule A could bond to the cysteine at position 110 of crystallin\nmolecule B. The cysteine at position 14 in crystallin molecule B then could bond to the cysteine at position\n110 of crystallin molecule C. This could continue on and on until a very large multi-protein complex\nformed. Disulfide bonds are covalent bonds and are, therefore, very strong. Covalent bonding between\nmany adjacent crystallin proteins would eventually produce a huge protein complex composed of many\ndifferent crystallin chains that would become insoluble and fall out of solution simply because of its\nenormous size.\n\nQuestion 2\nThe enzyme Phosphofructokinase (PFK) catalyzes the conversion of fructose 6-phosphate (F6P) to\nfructose 1, 6-bisphosphate (FBP), in step 3 of glycolysis.\nphosphofructokinase\nfructose 6-phosphate + ATP\nfructose 1,6-bisphosphate + ADP\n∆Go = -3.4 kcal\nmol\na) What two functions does ATP serve in this coupled reaction?\nThe hydrolysis of ATP provides the energy to drive this coupled reaction.\nATP also serves to donate a phosphate to fructose 1,6-bisphosphate from fructose 6-phosphate.\nb) Draw and label an energy diagram for this reaction. Include the relative energy levels of the\n°\nsubstrates and the products, the activation energy and the ∆G for the reaction.\nfructose 6-phosphate\n+ ATP\nfructose 1,6-bisphosphate\n+ ADP\nEnergy of\nactivation\n∆G = -3.4 kcals/mole\no\nReaction Progress\nIn erythrocytes, the following intracellular concentrations of metabolites are found:\nMetabolite\nConcentration\nFructose 6-phosphate\n.014 mM\nFructose 1,6-bisphosphate\n.028 mM\nAMP\n1 mM\nADP\n0.2 mM\nATP\n2 mM\nPi\n1 mM\n\n_______\nQuestion 2, continued\nc) What is the free energy change of the phosphofructokinase reaction under these cellular\nconditions (37°C)? Show your work. Is the reaction spontaneous under these conditions?\n[products]\n∆ G = ∆ Go + RT ln [reactants]\n[FBP] [ADP]\n∆G = - 3.4 kcals/mole + 0.61 kcals/mole ln [F6P] [ATP]\n∆G = - 3.4 kcals/mole + 0.61 kcals/mole ln [.028 mM] [0.2 mM]\n[.014 mM] [2 mM]\n∆ G = - 3.4 + 0.61 ln (0.2)\n∆ G = - 4.38\nSpontaneous\nPhosphofructokinase (PFK) is the primary site for regulation of the glycolytic pathway. The\nactivity of PFK is dependent on the energy status of the cell.\nd) Why would a cell regulate glycolysis?\nThe end result of glycolysis is the generation of ATP. If ATP levels in the cell are high, then the cell would\nnot need to spend resources to generate more ATP. However, if the levels of ATP are low, then the cell\nwould utilize the glycolytic pathway to generate the needed energy.\ne) What is the specific signal or molecule(s) to which PFK responds?\nPFK responds to the decreased ATP to ADP ratio (increased levels of ADP.\nf) Why does this mechanism of regulation make sense?\nNormally, a low ATP to ADP ratio indicates that cells need more energy currency available ready to use. By\nspeeding up glycolysis, more ATP can be formed from ADP to raise the ATP to ADP ratio.\ng) In certain tumor cells, an enzyme called ATPase becomes abnormally active, resulting in\nincreased hydrolysis of ATP to ADP. What would be the effect on the overall rate of glycolysis\nin these cells?\nThe activity of the glycolytic enzymes would increase, increasing the overall rate of glycolysis.\n\nQuestion 3\nG6P--\nglucose-6-phosphate\nF6P--\nFBP--\nG3P--\nGlyceraldehydes-3-\nphosphate\nDAP--\nDihydrohy-acetone-\nphosphate\nBPG--\n3-phospho-glycerate\n2-phospho-glycerate\nPEP--\nThe diagram below shows the change in free energy during the course of glycolysis.\nfructose-6-phosphate\nfructose-1,6-diphosphate\n1,3-di-phospho-glycerate\n3PG--\n2PG--\na) On the diagram, circle the two steps that require ATP. How did you determine that ATP was\nrequired for these steps?\nThe circled steps lead to the products that have an extra phosphate with respect to the reactant (glucose or\nthe product of the previous step of the pathway)\nb) There are steps where the product has a higher free energy than the reactants and yet these\nsteps do not require ATP. What drives these reactions?\nThe steps that do not require ATP are driven by the relative concentrations of reactants (higher) with respect\nto that of the product (low). The way the cell keeps the concentration of products low is by immediately using\nthe products as reactants in the next step of the pathway.\nc) On the diagram, box the energy harvesting steps.\nd) The harvested energy is stored in what molecule(s)?\nNADH and ATP\ne) What is/are the molecule(s) listed in (d) used for?\nATP is used to drive reactions in the cell, and NADH is used to regenerate NAD+ for the next rounds of\nglycolysis.\nGlucose\nGlycolysis\nG6P\nF6P\nFBP\n-140\n-150\n-130\n-120\n-110\n-100\n-90\n-80\n-70\n-60\n-50\n-40\n-30\n-20\n-10\n{\nG3P + DAP\nG3P\nBPG\n3PG\n2PG\nPEP\nPyruvate\nChange in free energy, ∆G (in kilocalories)\nFigure by MIT OCW.\n\nQuestion 4\nRubisco is a key enzyme in the dark phase of photosynthesis, and is the most abundant protein on\nEarth. It makes up roughly 50% of the protein content of chloroplasts. Rubisco catalyzes the\naddition of one molecule of CO2 to a five carbon sugar ribulose 1,5-biphosphate. The resulting six-\ncarbon sugar is unstable, and splits into two molecules of 3-phosphoglyceric acid.\na) You happen to have some 14CO2 around your lab, so you decide to place your favorite fichus\ninto a large hermetically sealed container, and pump some 14CO2 into the container to mix with\nregular atmosphere already in there. After some time, you move the fichus to a non-radioactive\nenvironment. A quick read with a Geiger counter reveals that the plant is now slightly\nradioactive.\ni. If you moved the plant after 1 minute, and analyzed the cells immediately, where\nwould you expect to find radioactivity? Circle all that apply:\nEvenly distributed throughout the cell\ncarbohydrates\nMostly in the chloroplasts\n\nnucleic acids\nMostly in the nucleus\nproteins\nMostly in the mitochondria\nlipids\nii. If you moved the plant after 1 minute and analyzed the cells the next day, would your\nanswer change? Why or why not?\nAfter 1 minute, we would expect most of 14C to be either in the form of 3-phosphoglyceric acid,\nribulose 1,5-biphosphate (that is regenerated from 3-phosphoglyceric acid), or in another\ncarbohydrate in the glucose-generating pathway. If the plant is removed and the leaves are taken for\nanalysis after 1 minute, but are not actually analyzed until the next day, we would expect some\nmetabolic processes to happen in the leaves in the intervening time, such that some 14C would end up\nin other molecules in the cells.\niii. If you moved the plant the next day, where would you expect to find radioactivity in a\nfichus leaf cell? Circle all that apply:\nEvenly distributed throughout the cell\ncarbohydrates\nMostly in the chloroplasts\nnucleic acids\nMostly in the nucleus\nproteins\nMostly in the mitochondria\nlipids\nJustify your answer(s)\nCO2 that is fixed from the atmosphere is used to make glucose that is then used in many intersecting\npathways in the cell. Glycolysis is used to make ATP, while other pathways lead to making of\nnucleotides, amino acids, and fats. In short, all mass was (at some point) gas.\n\nQuestion 4, continued\niv. You dream that your pet goat eats your experimental plant. In such a scenario, where\nwould you now find 14CO2?\nThe goat would use 14C acquired from the plant in all aspects of its metabolism. Some of it would exit\nin excrement, some would be used to build new molecules in goat's cells, and some would be respired\nout in the form of 14CO2.\nRubisco is a very inefficient enzyme--it only processes about three CO2 molecules per second.\nInside a plant chloroplast it forms large complexes with eight active sites in each. The complex\ndoes not appear to be allosterically regulated--each subunit appears to be very rigid, and each\nactive site operates independently from all other active sites in the complex. Recall that\nchloroplasts are small organelles.\nb) Propose a hypothesis for why Rubisco forms large complexes, and an experiment to test this\nhypothesis. Assume that you can create cells with any kind of mutant Rubisco protein you\nwould like.\nOne hypothesis would be that because the room inside the chloroplasts is limited, Rubisco forms tight\ncomplexes such that the most active sites can be exposed in the least amount of space.\nOne way to test this hypothesis is by creating cells where the only Rubisco protein is the mutant that can not\nform these large complexes. The model behind our hypothesis would then predict that in such cells, a lot less\nCO2 would get fixed, resulting in a lot less energy and raw materials available for the cell. It is reasonable to\nexpect that an organism consisting of this type of cells would have stunted growth.\nTherefore, if the mutant plant exhibits shunted growth, the result would be consistent with our hypothesis. If\nnot, our hypothesis would be proven wrong, and we would have to start again."

In this model, the strands are running parallel to each other.\n\nQuestion 2\nAfter a 7.014 nucleic acids lecture, a budding young artist named Moe Nay wanted to explore the\nshapes a single-stranded DNA molecule can take. He sketched the two shapes below. His TA was\nimpressed with Moe's imagination and artistic ability, but she informed Moe that only one of his\nsketches was feasible.

If yes, what is it?\n\nc) In the Meselson and Stahl experiment, where on the CsCl gradient would the following DNA\nbe found (low, middle, high):\ni. Double stranded DNA where both strands are labeled\nii. Double stranded DNA where one strand is labeled\niii. Double stranded DNA where neither strand is labled\nSemi-conservative replication was only one of the models of DNA replication proposed after the\ndiscovery of DNA structure. One of the other models was called conservative replication. In that\nmodel, new copies of both DNA strands would be made, but after replication was complete, the\ntwo \"old\" strands would stay together in a double helix, and the two \"new\" strands would form\nanother double helix.\nIn Meselson and Stahl experiment, a culture is grown on media with 15N, and switched to light N\nat time=0.\nd) If the mechanism is semi-conservative, what would you expect to see on the CsCl gradient after\nallowing the specified number of rounds of replication:\n# rounds replication after\nswitching to light N\nNumber of Bands\nLocation of bands\n(low, middle, high)\nNone\nOne\nTwo\nThree\ne) If the mechanism is conservative, what would you expect to see on the CsCl gradient after\nallowing the specified number of rounds of replication:\n# rounds replication after\nswitching to light N\nNumber of Bands\nLocation of bands\n(low, middle, high)\nNone\nOne\nTwo\nThree\nf) Treating the DNA samples with heat can break the hydrogen bonds that hold paired strands\ntogether.

Model A: DNA is a double-stranded helix with sugar-phosphate backbones in the center,\nand bases sticking out into solution. In this model, the strands are running anti-parallel to\neach other.\nThis model should be rejected. DNA backbone is an alternating sugar-phosphate polymer. Phosphates are\nnegatively charged. This model (originally favored by James Watson) would put these negative charges in\nclose proximity. Putting negative charges that close together would be very energetically unfavorable.\nii. Model B: DNA is a four-stranded helix with bases looking inwards. The model claims to be\nbased on the current crystallographic data.\nThis model should be rejected. While this model might be consistent with all data available to the editor, it\nis inconsistent with Rosalind Franklin's data. In particular, she was able to figure out that DNA adapts\ntwo forms in solution and to isolate and crystallize molecules of a unique form. It is that data that\nindicated to Crick that DNA was a double helix with matched bases on the inside of the molecule.\niii. Model C: DNA is a double-stranded helix with sugar-phosphate backbones on the outside,\nand bases in the middle, where purines (A and G) pair with purines and pyrimidines (T and\nC) pair with pyrimidines. The strands are running anti-parallel to each other.\nThis model should be rejected. This design does not assure compliance with Chargaff rules. In addition,\nRosalind Franklin's data shows that DNA has a very regular shape on the outside of the molecule. Purine\nbases have two nitrogenous rings each, while pyrimidines have one. Pairing purines with purines would\ncreate a very wide section, while pairing pyrimidines with pyrimidines would give a narrow section.\nThus, it would be clear from the outside of the molecule which base pair is on the inside. This would\ncontradict Franklin's crystallographic data that shows regular overall shape despite sequence variability.\niv. Model D: DNA is a double-stranded helix with sugar-phosphate backbones on the outside,\nand bases in the middle. In this model, the strands are running parallel to each other.\nThis model should be rejected. Attempting to base pair the bases that satisfy Chargaff's rules (A-T and C-\nG) off of the parallel backbones would lead to pairs that do not have similar overall shape and angles. In\nthat case there would be no way to assure the very regular shape on the outside of the DNA molecule that\nis demonstrated by Franklin's data.\n\nQuestion 2\nAfter a 7.014 nucleic acids lecture, a budding young artist named Moe Nay wanted to explore the\nshapes a single-stranded DNA molecule can take.

Circle the correct one.\n5'\n3'\n5'\n3'\n5' 3'\nb) What is wrong with the other drawing?\nBase pairing occurs between parallel strands of nucleic acid.\nc) What is the minimal number of primers that would be needed to create a complementary DNA\nstrand to the DNA strand in the correct drawing? Why?\nOnly one primer would be needed because the template is a single strand. By placing a primer on the 3' end\nof the template, we can copy the entire strand and create a double stranded molecule.\nd) On the drawing above, indicate the position(s) of the primer(s) needed to create an entire\ncomplementary strand. Label 5' and 3' of the primer(s).\ne) Would the new double stranded molecule assume the shape similar to one in the drawing? Why\nor why not?\nNo, the new double stranded molecule will assume the shape of the regular double helix. Once the bases make\nH-bonds with the complementary bases on the other strand, it is no longer favorable for them to make the\nintra-molecular H-bonds that hold the molecule in the drawing together.\nQuestion 3\na) In the Meselson and Stahl experiment, what part of the DNA gets labeled with 15N?\nIn this experiment, nitrogenous bases of the DNA get labeled with 15N.\nb) Would any other macromolecule get labeled in that experiment? If yes, what is it?\nRNA also has nitrogenous bases, and protein has N in its back bone and some side chains, so both types of\nmacromolecules would also get labeled in the experiment.\nc) In the Meselson and Stahl experiment, where on the CsCl gradient would the following DNA\nbe found (low, middle, high):\ni. Double stranded DNA where both strands are labeled\nlow\nii. Double stranded DNA where one strand is labeled\nmiddle\niii. Double stranded DNA where neither strand is labled\nhigh\n\nSemi-conservative replication was only one of the models of DNA replication proposed after the\ndiscovery of DNA structure. One of the other models was called conservative replication. In that\nmodel, new copies of both DNA strands would be made, but after replication was complete, the\ntwo \"old\" strands would stay together in a double helix, and the two \"new\" strands would form\nanother double helix.\nIn Meselson and Stahl experiment, a culture is grown on media with 15N, and switched to light N\nat time=0.\nd) If the mechanism is semi-conservative, what would you expect to see on the CsCl gradient after\nallowing the specified number of rounds of replication:\n# rounds replication after\nswitching to light N\nNumber of Bands\nLocation of bands\n(low, middle, high)\nNone\nlow\nOne\nmiddle\nTwo\nmiddle, high\nThree\nmiddle, high\ne) If the mechanism is conservative, what would you expect to see on the CsCl gradient after\nallowing the specified number of rounds of replication:\n# rounds replication after\nswitching to light N\nNumber of Bands\nLocation of bands\n(low, middle, high)\nNone\nlow\nOne\nlow, high\nTwo\nlow, high\nThree\nlow, high\nf) Treating the DNA samples with heat can break the hydrogen bonds that hold paired strands\ntogether. When the DNA is cooled, strands will re-pair but not necessarily with their original\npartner. If replication is conservative and you briefly treated the DNA samples with heat, how\nwould that change your results from a Meselson-Stahl experiment?\nIf the samples are briefly treated with heat any time after the first round of replication, we should expect to\nsee the appearance of the middle species of DNA. That species would have one heavy and one light chain of\nDNA. Once that species appears, it will be maintained through any future round of replication, since in the\nconservative model, parental DNA strands end the round of replication re-paired with each other.\nIf the samples are treated before replication begins, no change in the results will occur.\ng) If you discovered a new species of bacteria, would you repeat the Meselson and Stahl\nexperiment on it, or assume the mechanism of replication is semi-conservative? Why?\nWe would assume that the replication is semi-conservative. An organism employing a different mechanism\nwould have to employ a whole host of different enzymes to make it work. Like with glycolysis, this pathway\nis so critical to life that it is likely to be preserved by evolution because any mutation to the original system\nwould be likely be less fit.\nAlternatively, if this bacteria is a very old system that evolved to use a different replication system, we\nwould expect it to show up in some other organisms that evolved from this bacteria. But since only\nsemiconservative mechanism has ever been found, this interpretation is unlikely.\n\nQuestion 4\na) What (if any) editing function (5'Æ3' exo; 3'Æ5' exo; or mismatch repair) could repair the\nfollowing mistakes made by a DNA polymerase?\ni. adds an extra nucleotide\nmismatch repair and possibly 3'Æ5' exo.\nii. puts in a wrong nucleotide\n3'Æ5' exo or mismatch repair.\niii. slides backwards 3 nucleotides on the template strand, creating a repeat\nmismatch repair\nb) In the table below a number of mutant DNA polymerases are listed. For each polymerase,\nindicate which property of replication (rate of binding, frequency of mutation, or rate of\nreplication) will definitely be affected, and how (decrease or increase).\nMutant DNA Pol\nRate of DNA Binding Frequency of Mutation\nRate of Replication\nDoes not distinguish\nbetween DNA and\nRNA strands\ndecrease\nFrequently falls off of\nthe DNA\ndecrease\nFrequently misreads\ntemplate DNA\nincrease\nLow specificity for\ncorrect nucleotides\nincrease\nDoes not distinguish\nbetween dNTPs and\ndNDPs\ndecrease\nPoor catalyst of the\nnucleotide addition\nreaction\ndecrease\nMissing binding site\nfor processivity factor\ndecrease\nc) If a DNA polymerase contains a mutation that allows it to strongly bind RNA strands, can the\npolymerase now function as an RNA polymerase? Why or why not?\nThe polymerase would still not be able to function as an RNA polymerase because the domain that checks\nwhether the new nucleotide coming in is complementary to the base currently on the strand is still excluding\nRNA bases. What the enzyme would become is in fact a reverse transcriptase--an enzyme that creates a\nDNA strand based on the RNA template."

This gene encodes\nproduction of CHWDWN, protein essential for metabolizing sugar yummose.

Label the amino and carboxy\ntermini of the peptide.\nN-Met-Asp-Ala-Met- Ile-Leu-Val-Val-Ile-Trp-Gly-Cys-Thr...-C\n\nQuestion 1, continued\nd) One of these two mutants is fully functional, while the other is not. Which mutant peptide do\nyou predict is functional and which one is not? Why?\nPeptide A is truncated after three amino acids, so it is likely the one that is not functional. Peptide B has three\nextra amino acids on the amino terminus with respect to the wild-type peptide. These amino acids are not\nlikely to affect the overall fold of the peptide. Thus, it is likely that peptide B is fully functional.\nQuestion 2\nYou are fascinated by CHWDWN, and decide to continue your research over the summer.\nA graduate student in your lab has developed a collection of strains of bacteria containing different\nmutant tRNAs.\na) In wild-type cells, what is the anticodon on the tRNA charged with trp? Indicate 5' and 3'.\n5'-CCA-3' or 3'-ACC-5'\nb) In strain X, the 5' nucleotide of the anticodon on the trp tRNA is changed to a G, and no wild-\ntype trp tRNA is present.\ni. Would you expect CHWDWN polypeptide production in X to be affected? If yes, explain\nhow it would be affected. If no, explain why not.\nThe anticodon now reads 5'-GCA-3'. Because of the mutant anticodon, in strain X the tRNA charged\nwith amino acid trp pairs with the codon 5'-UGC-3'. Moreover, no wild-type trp tRNA exists in strain\nX. This would cause translation of CHWDWN to terminate after the sixth codon, since no tRNA will\nbe available to translate codon 7, UGG.\nBased on the gene sequence in Question 1, CHWDWN protein contains at least one trp codon.\nii. What proteins other than CHWDWN would you expect to be affected? Why?\nThe codon 5'-UGC-3' normally encodes cys. Thus, whenever the codon UGC appears in frame in the\ncoding sequence of a gene in strain X, part of the time amino acid trp will be inserted instead of cys. In\naddition, as illustrated in part i above, any time the codon for trp is present in frame in a coding\nsequence of a gene in strain X, translation will be terminated. So the proteins that would be affected are\nall those that have codons UGC or UGG in their coding sequences.\niii. Would you expect strain X to grow on media containing yummose as the only carbon\nsource? If yes, how strong would you expect that growth to be with respect to the wild-\ntype strain? If no, explain why you expect no growth.\nIn order to grow on yummose as the only carbon source, strain X would need to have a functional\nCHWDWN protein. Since translation of CHWDWN in strain X terminates after only six amino acids,\nit is very unlikely that strain X could grow on yummose as the only carbon source.\nc) In strain Z, the tRNA with the anticodon for trp found in wild-type cells is actually charged with\namino acid gln, and no wild-type trp tRNA is present.\ni. Would you expect CHWDWN polypeptide production in Z to be affected? If yes, explain\nhow it would be affected. If no, explain why not.\nSince the amino acid that a trp tRNA is charged with changes in strain Z, the seventh amino acid of the\nCHWDWN protein will now be gln, instead of trp.\nii. What proteins other than CHWDWN would you expect to be affected? Why?\nAny protein that in a wild-type strain contains amino acid trp will, in strain Z, contain amino acid gln\nin its place.\n\nQuestion 2, continued\niii. Would you expect strain Z to grow on media containing yummose as the only carbon\nsource? If yes, how strong would you expect that growth to be with respect to the wild-\ntype strain? If no, explain why you expect no growth.\nIn order to grow on yummose as the only carbon source, strain Z would need to have a functional\nCHWDWN protein. At least in position 7 of the protein, trp has been substituted by gln. If the codon\nfor trp is contained anywhere else in the gene, the amino acid substitution will occur in that position as\nwell. Gln is a smaller amino acid than trp is, and it is also polar, while trp is hydrophobic. Thus, is it\nlikely that substitution will have some impact on the protein, but it is unclear whether it will render the\nprotein unable to perform its function.\nd) You find that the protein sequence of CHWDWN is highly conserved (~80%) in humans.\nExcited, you acquire DNA fragments encoding bacteria and human CHWDWN proteins. You\n1. combine both samples into one test tube\n2. briefly treat the sample in the test tube with heat\n3. let the sample cool\n4. examine the contents of the test tube in electron microscope.\nYou find that you have three types of complexes in your sample:\nhuman\nds bacterial\nbacterial\nds human\nYou reason that two of the types are the original double stranded bacteria and human DNA,\nand that the third was made when a strand of the human DNA base paired with a strand of\nbacteria DNA.\nOn the figure above, identify each complex. For the bacteria-human hybrid, indicate which\nstrand is bacterial, and which is human.\nBriefly justify your choices.\nHuman DNA for the same protein is likely to be significantly longer than a bacterial gene encoding\nhomologous bacterial protein because the human gene is likely to have introns. Those are represented\nby the large loops in the human-bacterial hybrid in the figure above. Furthermore, because the protein\nsequence is not 100% identical between the human and bacterial versions, some portions of the human\nand bacterial genes are likely to not be similar enough to base pair (even with mismatches). Those\nregions are represented by the small bulges that occur on both the human and bacterial strands in the\nhybrid figure above.\n\nQuestion 3\nAs a UROP student, you are working in bacteria on the metabolism of the monosaccharide, theose.\nMetabolism of theose requires the enzymes X, Y, and Z. The genes encoding these enzymes are part\nof one operon, and the product of gene N (N protein) regulates the transcription of these three\ngenes. In a normal cell, protein A is always produced.

In order to have the disease, a person needs to\nhave only HbS hemoglobin. Recall also that a carrier of the disease is a person who has both HbS\nand HbA (wild-type hemoglobin) in their red blood cells.\nSuppose a colleague at your lab created some human stem cell lines from adult human carriers of\nsickle cell disease. As it happened, she left a dish with some of these cells in a hood where you were\nperforming your UV mutagenesis experiments on yeast.\nLater she told you that, strangely, when she coaxed those cells to differentiate into red blood cells\n(RBCs) and placed these new RBCs into low O2 environment, some cells assumed rigid sickle-like\nshapes.\na) Do you think that appearance of the sickle-like cells is related to your colleague leaving the dish\nin the hood? If yes, how? If no, what caused this phenomenon?\nUV light is a mutagen. Leaving the dish of stem cells in the hood exposed to UV light likely caused mutations\nin at least some of the individual cells. Because some of these cells developed into RBCs that behave as if they\nonly have HbS hemoglobin, it is logical to conclude that the stem cells from which these particular RBCs came\nsuffered a mutation is the copy of the gene for β-subunit that coded for the wild-type subunit. As a result, no\nHbA hemoglobin was produced in those cells, and all the hemoglobin produced was HbS.\nb) Is the DNA in the sickle-like cells different from that in the normal-shape cells? If so, how is it\ndifferent? If not, explain why not.\nActually, RBCs do not have a nucleus, and therefore, have no DNA. But the stem cells that differentiated into\nthe sickle-like cells had to only have genes encoding for the formation of HbS while the stem cells that\ndifferentiated into normal-shaped cells must have had genes encoding for both the HbS and HbA variants.\nc) Is the protein content of the sickle-like cells different from that in the normal-shape cells? If so,\nhow is it different? If not, explain why not.\nYes, sickle-like cells must contain only HbS, while normal-shaped cells in general must contain HbA, and\nmay contain some HbS. Because the stem cells in this experiment came from carriers of sickle-cell disease, the\nnormal-shape RBCs must also contain some HbS.\nd) Are your answers to parts b and c related? If yes, how are they related? If no, explain why they\nare not related.\nThe stem cells in the dish all had the same versions of the genes. Because they came from carriers of sickle-cell\nanemia, they had one copy of a gene encoding wild-type β-subunit, leading to formation of HbA, and another\nthat encoded a mutant β-subunit, leading to formation of HbS. If they were not exposed to a mutagen, they\nwould likely all differentiate into RBCs that retained their normal shape even at low levels of O2.\nAfter being exposed to UV, some of the cells underwent mutations, and in some number of these cells the\nmutations occurred in the wild-type copy of the β-subunit. Those mutations altered the gene sequence, such\nthat the mutated sequence now coded for a β-subunit that leads to the formation of HbS, instead of HbA.\nAs a result, the RBCs differentiated from such a stem cell would contain only HbS, and would become\ndeformed into the sickle-like shape if exposed to low levels of O2.\n\nThe stem cells that did not undergo a mutation in the β-subunit gene would differentiate into RBCs that\nretained normal shape even at low levels of O2 because they contain both HbS and HbA."

Problem sets will not be accepted late.\nSolutions will be posted on the web.\nQuestion 1\nOrganisms can use a variety of carbon and energy sources, depending on their availability in the\nenvironment. Oxidation and reduction reactions play critical roles in metabolism, and the relative\nfavorability of these reactions often dictates the type of metabolism an organism will employ in a\ngiven situation. For example, organisms that conduct aerobic respiration (like humans) use organic\ncarbon compounds (like glucose) as both their carbon source and their energy source.\na) What compound is reduced by the transfer of electrons from glucose? What are the oxidized and\nreduced forms of this compound?\nElectrons are then passed down the electron transport chain, sequentially reducing proteins in the\nchain, in the process creating a proton gradient for ATP synthesis.\nb) What is the final electron acceptor for organisms performing aerobic respiration? Why do\norganisms need a final electron acceptor?\nThe reduction of oxygen is a very favorable reaction; in fact oxygen is the most favorable electron\nacceptor. Organisms conducting respiration in the absence of oxygen do so anaerobically, using\nother compounds as electron acceptors.\nc) Consider the following environments where different compounds are present. Circle the\ncompound in each environment most likely to be used as an electron acceptor.

Whereas respiration uses organic compounds as electron donors, and\nphotosynthesis uses water as an electron donor (to replace the electron excited by light), many\norganisms use inorganic compounds as electron donors and sources of energy.\nd) For each electron donor below, give the compound it will be converted to upon oxidation. Circle\nthe compound that will yield the most energy upon oxidation.\nH2S Æ\nNH3 Æ\n-\nNO2 Æ\nFe2+ Æ\nCH4 Æ\n\nQuestion 1, continued\ne) Organisms using the above compounds as electron donors are employing what type of\nmetabolism? Are these organisms most likely prokaryotes, archea, or eukaryotes (pick all that\napply)?\nQuestion 2\nCurious about the Sorcerer II expedition of Craig Venter, you take your own research vessel to the\nSargasso Sea to study the phytoplankton community there. At a particular location in the open\nocean, you measure several environmental parameters (nutrient and light levels) down the water\ncolumn as well as the relative abundances of two ecotypes (i.e. strains), I and II, of Prochlorococcus, a\nunicellular cyanobacterium.\nInexplicably, as you are returning to Woods Hole to analyze your data, your ship is raided by\npirates, who steal your data on the abundance of the two ecotypes. Fortunately, the pirates did not\ntake your data on nutrient and light levels. You remember that you have genome sequences for the\ntwo strains, providing you with information on which genes each ecotype has. Based on this\ngenomic information (in the questions, below) and the depth profile data, answer the following\nquestions.\nFigure: Depth profile for the region of the Sargasso Sea where you\nmeasured the abundance of two Prochlorococcus strains.\nsolid black line: dissolved NH4+ and urea\n-\ndashed black line: nitrate (NO3 )\nsolid gray line: phosphate (PO43-)\nThe genome of ecotype II appears to have nitrate reductase,\nallowing it to utilize nitrate as a nitrogen source. Ecotype I does not\nappear to have nitrate reductase.\na) Based on this observation and the nitrogen data above, which ecotype should dominate which\npart of the water column (shallow/0-100 m or deep/100-200 m) and why?\nb) Name two important molecules in the cell that require nitrogen for biosynthesis. In which\nredox form does the cell require its nitrogen, oxidized or reduced?\n\nFigure by MIT OCW.\nDepth in water column, m\nDepth, m\nConcentration of Nutrient, umol/kg\n\nQuestion 2, continued\nc) Without using the graph, would you expect one or both of these ecotypes to have genes for\nphosphate transport proteins in their genomes? If yes, which one(s) and why? Why don't you\nneed to use the graph?\nProchlorococcus possesses two types of chlorophyll, a and b. Chlorophyll a (Chl a) absorbs longer\nwavelengths (red) better than chlorophyll b (Chl b), whereas Chl b absorbs shorter wavelengths\n(blue) better than Chl a. Blue wavelengths penetrate deeper down the water column because\nthey are scattered and absorbed less by water than red wavelengths. The operons for Chl a and\nChl b biosynthesis are expressed at different levels in these two ecotypes, such that ecotype II has\na higher Chl b/a ratio than ecotype I (ecotype I has a comparatively low Chl b/a ratio).\nd) Which ecotype would you expect to dominate shallow (0-100 m) water and which would you\nexpect to dominate deep (100-200 m) water? Why?\nIn general, photosynthetic organisms, such as phytoplankton, grow faster under higher light\nintensity. However, as we just observed, one of these ecotypes has evolved to prefer a lower light\nintensity.\ne) Why has this ecotype evolved for optimal growth at low light intensity?\nQuestion 3\nWalking down the infinite corridor one day, you and your friend are suddenly engulfed in a space-\ntime distortion and transported to a barren world covered with fake-looking rocks and sparse\nvegetation, strikingly similar to a set from the original Star Trek. After an indeterminate period of\nblind panic, you and she realize you may be stuck there for a long time, and begin to assess the\nsituation. You find that there are only three non-microbial organisms on the planet: raspberry\nbushes, ants, and anteaters. Having just finished 7.014, you both realize that your introduction into\nthis ecosystem is bound to disrupt it and, to maximize your survival, you should be careful of what\nyou eat.

What should you eat to get the highest ecological efficiency out of\nthe system and why?\nQuestion 4\nA fictional plant Greenever grows all year around, even in New England, and blooms in January. A\npatch of these plants is the only thing that brightened the view from your dorm window this winter.\nIn talking to your friend about your favorite plant, you realize that your friend also has a Greenever\nplant patch outside of his window, but his did not bloom this winter. You consult Google, and\nverify that the blooming variety is indeed the wild type.\nIntrigued, you cross the plants outside your window with those outside your friend's window. All\nresulting plants bloom next January.\na) You reason that the trait is caused by a single gene, Bloom, that you abbreviate to Bl. What is the\nmode of inheritantce of Bl? Why?\nb) You cross first generation plants. What results do you expect to see? Why?\nIn addition to Bl gene, you manage to identify two other genes in Greenever, A and D.\nA schematic of a diploid nucleus of the Greenever is drawn below. It contains three pairs of chromosomes\n(2n = 6). As drawn, it is about to begin the process of meiosis but has not yet replicated its DNA.\n\nQuestion 4, continued\nThe cell that contains this nucleus\n- has the genotype AaBlblDd where\n- the A and Bl alleles are linked (as are the a and bl alleles) and\n- the D gene is on a different chromosome.\nRedraw the schematic of this nucleus when it is at metaphase prior to the first meiotic division.

Why do\norganisms need a final electron acceptor?\nThe terminal electron acceptor for aerobes is oxygen.

And since ecotype II has the nitrate reductase gene, it is\nlikely that ecotype II dominates deep water, while ecotype I dominates shallow water.\nb) Name two important molecules in the cell that require nitrogen for biosynthesis. In which\nredox form does the cell require its nitrogen, oxidized or reduced?\nProteins and DNA require nitrogen for biosynthesis. Both use nitrogen in its reduced form.\nFigure by MIT OCW.\nDepth in water column, m\nDepth, m\nConcentration of Nutrient, umol/kg\n\nQuestion 2, continued\nc) Without using the graph, would you expect one or both of these ecotypes to have genes for\nphosphate transport proteins in their genomes? If yes, which one(s) and why? Why don't you\nneed to use the graph?\nBoth ecotypes would need phosphate transport genes because phosphorus is an essential nutrient and no\nliving organism is capable of getting phosphorus from the air. We do not need to use the graph because the\nneed for phosphorus is universal and does not depend on the particular organisms in the graph.\nProchlorococcus possesses two types of chlorophyll, a and b. Chlorophyll a (Chl a) absorbs longer\nwavelengths (red) better than chlorophyll b (Chl b), whereas Chl b absorbs shorter wavelengths\n(blue) better than Chl a.

Why?\nEcotype I would dominate shallow water because it is better suited to exploit longer wavelength light, and\nthat is the light that is available in the shallow but not deep water. Ecotype II would dominate deep water\nbecause it is better suited to exploit shorter wavelength light, and any deep water photosynthesizer would\nhave to rely primarily on this type of light. This is because the longer wavelength light does not penetrate\nwell that deeply into the ocean.\nIn general, photosynthetic organisms, such as phytoplankton, grow faster under higher light\nintensity. However, as we just observed, one of these ecotypes has evolved to prefer a lower light\nintensity.\ne) Why has this ecotype evolved for optimal growth at low light intensity?\nBecause shallow water has brighter light and more available energy than deep water, it will be a\ncompetitive environment where nutrients are scarce. High-light-adapted ecotypes will have an advantage\nin the shallow water. Cyanobacteria that cannot compete with them, but can survive in darker conditions\nand exploit the nutrients there (e.g. ecotype II) will have an advantage in the deeper water. The unique\ngenes and gene regulation mechanisms that allow ecotype II to take advantage of the deep water\nenvironment probably arose during the process of optimization for the deep water conditions.\nQuestion 3\nWalking down the infinite corridor one day, you and your friend are suddenly engulfed in a space-\ntime distortion and transported to a barren world covered with fake-looking rocks and sparse\nvegetation, strikingly similar to a set from the original Star Trek.

Your friend starts to study the situation, and she draws the following energy flow diagram\nto represent the ecosystem (next page):\na) You look at your friend's diagram\ni) What do the arrows B, F, and J represent? Respiration: B = raspberry; F = ant; J = anteater.\nii) Why do both plants and animals \"lose\" energy by the process in part (i) above?\nThe process of respiration generates ATP by gradually capturing the energy of the breakdown of\nglucose into CO2. That process is 60% efficient, while 40% of energy in glucose is lost to heat. The\nATP generated is used to power the organism, and is thus, unavailable to the next trophic level.\n\nQuestion 3, continued\nB\nD\nF\nG\nJ\nK\nM\nN\nZ\ni\ni\nC\nA\nE\nI\nL\nH\nY\nraspberr es\nant s\nDet r t us\nant eat er\niii) Assuming that the thickness of all lines is proportional to the amount of energy transferred\nby that route, what mistake has she made in drawing the diagram?\nEnergy is lost at each trophic level.

Furthermore, they are sessile (don't move) and,\ntherefore, don't spend energy on movement.\ne) You realize that your friend has been wasting her time, because you know the answer without\nworrying about the analysis. What should you eat to get the highest ecological efficiency out of\nthe system and why?\nThe lower the trophic level you eat, the less energy is lost to respiration and detritus, therefore you should\neat raspberries.\nQuestion 4\nA fictional plant Greenever grows all year around, even in New England, and blooms in January. A\npatch of these plants is the only thing that brightened the view from your dorm window this winter.\nIn talking to your friend about your favorite plant, you realize that your friend also has a Greenever\nplant patch outside of his window, but his did not bloom this winter. You consult Google, and\nverify that the blooming variety is indeed the wild type.\nIntrigued, you cross the plants outside your window with those outside your friend's window. All\nresulting plants bloom next January.\na) You reason that the trait is caused by a single gene, Bloom, that you abbreviate to Bl. What is the\nmode of inheritantce of Bl? Why?\nNot blooming is a recessive trait because all plants in the first generation are phenotypically wild type.\nb) You cross first generation plants. What results do you expect to see? Why?\nThe cross would be Blbl X Blbl. We would expect a standard 3:1 phenotypic ratio of wild-type: mutant plants.\nWe would expect the genotypes of the phenotypically wild-type plants to be BlBl and Blbl in a 1:2 ratio, and\nthe genotype of the mutant plants to be blbl.\nIn addition to Bl gene, you manage to identify two other genes in Greenever, A and D.\nA schematic of a diploid nucleus of the Greenever is drawn below. It contains three pairs of chromosomes\n(2n = 6).

      "content": "MIT Department of Biology\n7.014 Introductory Biology, Spring 2005\nThe 7.014 Final Exam\n*YOU MUST BRING YOUR ID.\nThis will be a cumulative, closed book exam.\nPlease bring a non- programmable calculator.\n\nQuestion 1\nYour ongoing interest in bioluminescent organisms has lead you to study the Hawaiian squid,\nEuprymna scolopes. Most nocturnal creatures cast shadows under the bright Hawaiian\nmoonlight, and are easy prey to predatory fish. This type of squid can shine light downwards\nto match the moonlight and avoid casting a shadow thereby decreasing predation.\nTo provide squid for your studies, you maintain a large, self-supporting squid tank. The food\nweb of the tank is shown below.\nphytoplankton\nsmall fish\nsquid\ndetritivores\nWhen your tank is at steady state, you can harvest 10 kg of squid carbon/week and all the\nother biomasses (phytoplankton, fish, squid, and detritivores) remain constant.\nGiven the following values:\n- NPP of phytoplankton = 2.0 kilograms of organic carbon per gram of phytoplankton per day\n- plant production efficiency = 60%\n- fish exploitation efficiency = 50%\n- fish assimilation efficiency = 20%\n- fish net production efficiency = 5%\n- squid exploitation efficiency = 50%\n- squid assimilation efficiency = 80%\n- squid net production efficiency = 40%\na) What NPP (in kilograms of carbon) is required to support a harvest of 10 kg of squid carbon\nper week at steady state? Show your work.\n\nQuestion 1, continued\nb) Month after month, your squid harvest is 10 kg/week and all the biomasses remain\nconstant. One month, you find that you can only harvest 5 kg of squid carbon/week and\nmaintain steady state.\nYou suspect that something has contaminated your tank and reduced your yield. You propose\ntwo models to account for the reduction in yield. To test these models, you measure the\nrespiration rate of the detritivores in the tank. You find that detritivore respiration has\nincreased by 5 kg of carbon per week.\nModel 1: Phytoplankton photosynthesis is inhibited so that they now only produce 1.0\nkilogram of organic carbon per gram of phytoplankton per day, but at this new steady state, all\nother efficiencies remain constant.\ni) Is this model consistent with your measurement? Explain.\nModel 2: 5 kg of fish per week are dying with all other efficiencies remaining constant.\nii) Is this model consistent with your measurement? Explain.\nc) In their native ocean environment, the squid feed on a wide variety of small fish and\ninvertebrates. You suspect that the squid is the keystone species in this ecosystem. What\nexperiment could you do to test this theory? What result do you predict?\nQuestion 2\na) You want to build a larger squid facility. To make better use of your resources, you plan to\nconstruct a life table to determine the mortality rate, fecundity, and the net replacement value\nof your population. You follow 1000 squid eggs and collect the data below.\nstage\nnumber\nunfertilized eggs\neggs hatched into juveniles\njuveniles at 2 month\njuveniles at 4 months\njuveniles at 6 months\njuveniles at 8 months = adult\nadult at 10 months\nadults at 1 year\nadults at 2 year\ni) If you were to make a cohort life table using this data, how many squid would you\ninitially have in your cohort?\nii) If the fecundity of squid at 8 months = 10, and the fecundity of squid at 10 months =\n16, during which 2 month time period are more offspring produced?\n\ncarryng capacity\nQuestion 2, continued\nb) Surprisingly, your tank-raised squid are not luminous. In fact, the glow seen in free living\nsquid is due to a species of bacteria, Vibrio fischeri that live in a specialized light organ within\nthe squid. When juvenile squid hatch, ambient water enters the light organ. V. fischeri and the\nmany other bacterial species in this ambient water also enter the light organ and colonize it.\nAll the bacteria initially flourish in this nutrient rich environment, but after 10 hours, only V.\nfischeri remain in the light organ.\ni) The interaction between V. fischeri and the other bacterial species initially colonizing\nthe light organ can best be described as _____________________.\nii) The interaction between the squid and V. fischeri can best be described\nas\n_____________________.\niii) Is the light organ of the squid the fundamental niche of V. fischeri.\nWhy?\niv) Is the light organ of the squid the realized niche of V. fischeri.\nWhy?\nc) The interaction between the squid and V. fischeri is dynamic. V. fischeri are only luminescent\nwhen the density of cells is near carrying capacity, yet when nutrients become limiting,\nluminescence ceases. To overcome this problem, the squid expel 90-95% of the V. fischeri from\nthe light organ as each new day begins. By the following evening, the bacteria that remained\nhave repopulated the light organ and it is once again fully functional.\nUsing this information, graph the V. fischeri population within the light organ of a squid over\nseveral days. Indicate carrying capacity on the above graph.\ntime\n\nQuestion 3\na) Match each of the following structures to the type of molecule it represents:\n1) protein\n2) RNA\n3) DNA\nNH 2\n-O\nO\nCH2\nO\nP\nN\nN\nN\nN\nO\nH\nH\nO-\nH\nH\nH\nO\nP\nO\nO\n-\nO\nH\nH\nO\nH C\nH\nH\nadenine\nthymine\nH\nO\nP\nO\nO\n-\nO\nH\nH\nO\nH C\nHO\nH\nH\nH\nN\nHN\nO\nO\nN\nN\nN\nN\nNH2\nCH 3\nO\nCH2\nO\nP\nO\nN\nN\nN\nN\nNH2\nO\nH\nH\nO -\n-\nH\nH\nadenine\nadenine\nOH\nO\nO\nP\nO\nO\n-\nO\nH\nH\nO\nH C\nH\nH\nuracil\nO\nP\nO\nO\n-\nO\nH\nH\nO\nH C\nHO\nH\nH\nN\nHN\nO\nN\nN\nN\nN\nNH2\nadenine\nOH\nOH\n+ NH2 NH 2\nH C\nCH3\nC\nO\nC\nO\nO\nNH2\nCH\nNH\nC\nCH2\n(CH )\n(CH )\n2 2\nCH2\n+\nH\nH\nH\nH3N\nC\nC\nN\nC\nC\nN\nC\nC\nN\nC\nCOO\nH\nH\nH\nH\nO\nO\nO\n\nQuestion 3, continued\nb) Fill in the blanks in this representation of the central dogma.\nChoose from:\nnucleus, translation, RNA, membrane, DNA,\ncytoplasm, polysaccharide, transcription, or protein\nThis process is ____________________ .\nIn eukaryotes, this process occurs in the\n_______________________.\nThis process is ____________________ .\nIn prokaryotes, this process occurs in the\n_______________________.\nQuestion 4\nIn analyzing differences between star squash players and armchair warriors, you have\ndiscovered a protein that exists only in the squash players.

The mutant allele differs from the wild-type\nallele by a single base-pair (bp) substitution. This substitution eliminates a NheI restriction site\nthat is present in the wild-type allele. (The mutant allele is not cut by NheI.) A pedigree of a\nfamily exhibiting this condition is shown below:\nnormal male\naffected male\nnormal female\naffected female\nYou isolate DNA from four individuals in the pedigree. Using PCR techniques, you amplify a\n1000 bp portion of their DNA which includes the site affected by the mutation. You digest the\nPCR products with NheI and analyze the resulting DNA fragments on a gel:\n1000 bp\n600 bp\n400 bp\nIndividual:\nNheI\nNheI\nNheI\nNheI\na) Based on these data, is this gene located on an autosome or the X-chromosome? Briefly justify\nyour reasoning.\nb) Based on these data, is the mutant phenotype dominant or recessive to wild-type and why?\nc) If individuals 3 and 4 have a daughter, what is the probability that she will be affected?\nJustify your reasoning.\n\nQuestion 8, continued\nd) You sequence the region around the NheI site in the wild-type PCR product. You then\nsequence the corresponding region in the mutant PCR product and discover that not only did\nthe mutation eliminate the NheI site in the mutant allele but it has created a new PvuII\nrestriction site. The recognition sites for the two enzymes are indicated below.\nNheI cuts:\n5' GCTAGC 3'\nPvuII cuts: 5' CAGCTG 3'\n3' CGATCG 5'\n3' GTCGAC 5'\nA portion of one strand of the wild-type DNA sequence is shown below:\n5'....GCTAGCTG...3'\nWhat is the sequence of this same region in the mutant allele? Indicate the 5' and the 3' ends of\nthe DNA sequence.\ne) Individuals 1 and 2 have another child, 9, who is affected by the genetic condition.\nYou PCR amplify the 1000 bp region affected by the mutation from individuals 1, 2, and 9,\nNheI PvuII\nIndividual:\nNheI PvuII\nNheI PvuII\n1000 bp\n600 bp\n400 bp\ndigest the PCR products with NheI or PvuII, and analyze the restriction fragments on a gel:\nWhat event occurred and how does this explain the data shown above?\n\nQuestion 9\nConsider the following hypothetical chromosomal region containing two genes, fadA and fadB,\nnecessary for the breakdown of oleic acid in a bacterium.\nfadX\nP\nO\n\nfadB\nfadA\n/\nPx\nP = Promoter\nO = Operator\nThe FadX protein, which is continuously produced, binds to the operator in the presence of\noleic acid.\na) Is the FadX protein a repressor or an activator of the fadA and the fadB genes? Briefly justify\nyour reasoning.\nb) For each of the following mutants (m1 - m4), predict the level of FadA in the presence of\noleic acid. Circle either \"Low\" or \"High\".\nLevel of FadA with oleic acid present\n\nm1\nO is deleted\nLow\nHigh\nm2\nLoss-of-function mutation in fadX\nLow\nHigh\nm3\nP is deleted\nLow\nHigh\nm4\nFadX is always bound to O\nLow\nHigh\nSolutions:\nQuestion 1:\na) 10kg / (.4)(.8)(.5)(.05)(.2)(.5) = 12,500 kg/week\nb)\ni) This model would predict that 1/2 as much carbon would be fixed by the phytoplankton. Since\nall efficiencies remain the same, this would cause all flows to decrease to 50% of their non-\npoisoned levels. This would therefore reduce the detritivore respiration by 50%. This is not\nconsistent with the observed increase.\nii) This model would predict that 5 kg carbon per week of fish are dying and therefore becoming\ndetritus. Since all efficiencies are the same and the tank remains at steady state, this additional\ninput to the detritus must be made up for by an equal increase in output from detritus. Since the\nonly output from detritus is respiration (refractory carbon cannot increase at steady state),\ndetritivore respiration must increase by 5 kg carbon per day. This is consistent with your\nmeasurement.\n\nQuestion 1, continued\nc) You would need to exclude the squid from an area of the ocean. If squid are the keystone species, you\nwould expect to see a decrease in the species diversity of the small fish and invertebrates.\nQuestion 2:\na)\ni) 840\nii) More offspring are produce during the period 8-10 months, where 24(10) = 240\n(as compare to the period 10-12 months, 14(16) = 224)\nb)\ni) The interaction between V. fischeri and the other bacterial species initially colonizing\nthe light organ can best be described as competition\nii) The interaction between the squid and V. fischeri can best be described\nas symbiotic or mutualism or mutualistic\nThe squid are less visible to predators, and the bacteria are provided a safe, nutrient rich\nenvironment\niii) No, The fundamental niche is anywhere that the V. fischeri can exist. You know that V.\nfischeri can also live in the ambient water, and it is likely that they could exist in a wide variety\nof places.\niv) No, The realized niche is where you actually find the V. fischeri . You know that V. fischeri\ncan also live in the ambient water, so the light organ can not be the realized niche\nc)\ntime\ncarryng capacity\n\nQuestion 3\na) In order, they are DNA, RNA, and protein\nb) DNA\nÆ\nRNA\nÆ\nprotein\nc)\nDNA\nRNA\nprotein\nTh is p ro c e s s is ____________________ .\nTh is p ro c e s s is ___________________ .\ntranscription\ntranslation\nIn eu ka r yo te s , t his p ro c es s o cc u rs in t h e\nIn pr ok a ry ot e s, t his p ro c es s o cc u rs in t h e\n_______________________.\ncytoplasm\nnucleus\n_______________________.\nQuestion 4\na) The m1 and m4 mutations are in the same gene. This is a complementation test. The diploid strain\nhas the same growth phenotype as the haploid single mutants; the two mutations fail to complement\n(fail to produce the wild-type phenotype) in the double heterozygote. The m1 and m4 mutations must\nboth inactivate the same gene (which codes for an enzyme essential for serine biosynthesis) so that the\ndiploid double mutant has two mutant alleles of the same gene.\nm1, m4\nm3\nm2\nA\nserine\nB\nb)\nC\nc)\ni) This haploid mutant will grow on media supplemented with intermediate A.\nii) Intermediate C will accumulate when this haploid mutant is grown on minimal medium.\nQuestion 5\na)\ni) van der Waals\nii) hydrogen\niii) ionic\niv) van der Waals\nb)\nstrongest interaction with substrate 2 is van der Waals\nstrongest interaction with substrate 3 is ionic\nc) substrate 3 would bind the most tightly.

Explain why photosynthesis is occurring but no O2 is being\nproduced.\nCyclic photophosphorylation produces glucose from CO2 but uses the redox reaction H2S Æ S\nas a source of electrons for the production of NADPH, Thus O2 is not released as a waste\nproduct.\nii) Cyclic photophosphorylation converts CO2 into glucose. Briefly describe how these\norganisms use ATP synthase to generate the ATP needed for this conversion.\nLight energy excites electrons in chorophyll. These electrons are donated to a series of membrane\nproteins, each more electronegative than the last. As the electrons are passed from protein to\nprotein, H+ ions are pumped across the membrane to create an H+ gradient. H+ ions move\nthrough the ATP synthase protein, down the charge and concentration gradient this movement\nis coupled to the synthesis of ATP from ADP.\niii) Once the glucose is made, these anaerobic organisms break it down to obtain energy.\n- What process do these organisms use to obtain energy from glucose? Glycolysis\n- What products are generated in this process?

Briefly describe how this additional energy is generated.\nSome of this additional energy comes directly from further oxidation of pyruvate into CO2. The\nelectrons from NADH are used to generate further energy. These electrons are donated to a series\nof membrane proteins, each more electronegative than the last. As the electrons are passed from\nprotein to protein, H+ ions are pumped across the membrane to create an H+ gradient.

Why?\nSerine, it is polar and can form hydrogen bonds with region 1. Alanine would only interact with\nvan der Waals forces\nii) Would Lysine or Glutamic Acid interact more strongly with region 2? Why?\n\nLysine, it is (+) charged and can form ionic bonds with region 2. Glutamic acid is also\n(-) charged and would repel.\nd) You design many proteins that bind tightly in this pocket. One of them has isoleucine\nassociated with region 3. You substitute phenylalanine for isoleucine and find this prevents\nbinding of this protein. Phenylalanine and isoleucine form the same kinds of interactions with\nthe binding pocket, so why can't the phenylalanine version of the protein bind?\nPhenylalanine has a large side chain that prevents the substrate from fitting into the pocket.\nSteric hinderence.\nQuestion 4 (19 points)\nUnder standard conditions, the reaction A + B Æ C + D has a positive ∆Go.\nThe reaction C + D Æ A + B has a negative ∆Go.\n∆Go\nA + B\nC + D\nActivation energy lowered\nwhen enzyme added\nActivation energy\nReacti on Pro gre ss\na) On the above energy diagram above, label the following:\n- activation energy\n-\n∆Go\n- C + D\n- A + B\nc) Modify the above diagram to show how it would change if an enzyme that catalyzed the\nreaction is added.\nd) What effect, if any, would this have on the reaction?\nAn enzyme does not change the ∆Go of the reaction, but by lowering the activation energy, it speeds up\nthe reaction C + D Æ A + B."

Why or why not?\nNo, the picture above is of a ribbon representation, i.e. backbone trace. It does not show any of the\nsidechains, and thus does not give us a clear picture of how much space the protein occupies. In\naddition, for the atoms in the backbone, the vdW radii are not shown.\nThe positively charged K+ ion is a very small soluble molecule.\nf) Explain why K+ cannot come across the membrane without a channel protein.\nThe tails of the membrane lipids are hydrophobic. It is not energetically favorable for a charged\nmolecule, such as K+ to be in a hydrophobic environment. Thus, K+ by itself can not come across the\nmembrane.\nYou isolate a mutant of the K+ channel that transports less K+ than normal. You run both the\nwild-type and mutant proteins on a denaturing gel and get the following result:\nWildtype\nMutant\ng) From the gel data we can conclude that (circle all that apply):\ni) Each subunit of the mutant protein is\nshorter than\nlonger than\nprimary\nsecondary\ntertiary\nthe same length as in the wild-type protein.\nJustify your answer(s)\nThe mutant protein shows only one band on the gel, meaning that it consists of only one type of\nsubunit. Denaturing gel separates protein fragments based on their size, with shorter fragments\ntraveling further. Since the mutant subunit travels farther on the gel, we conclude that the\nmutant subunits are shorter than the wild type ones.\nii) The mutant and wild-type proteins could differ in their\nstructure.\nJustify your answer(s)\nBecause the mutant subunits are shorter than wild-type subunits, it is clear that the primary\nstructure is affected. If the lost fragment is of significant length, tertiary structure will most\nlikely be affected too. And depending on where the fragment the lost in the mutant subunit is\nlocated in the wild-type protein, it is possible that the secondary structure would also be altered.\n\nQuestion 1, continued\nThe K+\n+ ions may associate. Below is an image\nof one of the binding pockets of the K+ channel shown from above.\nchannel has several binding pockets in which K\nh) Circle the strongest type of interaction that exists between the K+ ion and the Glu residues.\nCovalent bond\nVan der Waals\nHydrogen bond\nIonic bond\ni) You isolate a series of mutant K+ channel proteins where the two Asp residues have been\nreplaced by amino acid X (see table below). For each X, indicate whether K+ binding in the\nresulting pocket will be stronger, weaker, or the same and give a brief explanation of your\nchoice.\nX\nInteraction (choose one)\nExplain why\nAsn\nstronger weaker same\nSame size, weaker interaction-- H-bond instead of ionic bond\nLeu\nstronger weaker same\nApproximately same size, weaker interaction-- vdW instead of\nionic bond\nPhe\nstronger weaker same\nWeaker interaction-- vdW instead of ionic bond. Phe is also\nsignificantly larger than Asp, so steric hindrance is likely\nj) Suppose you isolate another mutant that has four Glu residues instead of two Asp and two\nGlu residues in the pocket above. You find that the mutant has decreased K+ transport.\nExplain this result.\nGlu is a negatively charged amino acid, just like Asp. Therefore, mode of interaction, i.e. ionic bond\nwould be preserved. The only difference between Glu and Asp is the extra CH2 group in Glu. Since\nthe function of the protein is impaired, we conclude that it is harder for the K+ ion to fit into the new,\nsmaller binding pocket.\n\nQuestion 2 (36 points)\na) Fill in the blanks:\nAn autotroph________ is an organism that is capable of making its own food store, while a\nheterotroph__________ must rely on getting food from the environment.\nb) What types of organisms carry out\ni) glycolysis (circle all that apply)\nautotroph\nheterotroph\nprokaryotes\neukaryotes\nii) photosynthesis (circle all that apply)\nautotroph\nheterotroph\nprokaryotes\neukaryotes\nBelow are simplified chemical flowcharts of glycolysis and the Krebs (citric acid) cycle.\nIn the course of glycolysis, NAD+ is reduced to NADH.\nc) In glycolysis, what is the original source of the electrons that are used to reduce NAD+?\nThe original source of electrons in glycolysis is glucose.\nGlycolysis\nATP\nATP\n2 ATP\n2 ATP\nADP\nADP\n2NAD+\n2 NADH\nNADH\nNAD+\n2ADP\n2ADP\n+ 2P\n+ 2H+\nCoA\nCO2\nKrebs Cycle\nMolecules In\nMolecules Out\nCoA\nAcetyl-CoA\nPyruvate\nGlucose\nFructose 6-Phosphate\nFructose 1, 6-Diphosphate\nGlucose 6-Phosphate\nGlyceraldehyde 3-Phosphate\n1, 3 Diphosphoglyceric Acid\n3 Phosphoglyceric Acid\nPyruvic Acid\nNADH\nFADH2\nNADH\nNADH\nCoA\nAcetyl Coenzyme A\nMalic Acid\nFAD\nNAD+\nNAD+\nNAD+\nSuccinic Acid\nADP\na-ketoglutaric Acid\na-ketoglutaric\nAcid Derivative\nCO2\nCO2\nOxaloacetic Acid\nCitric Acid\nATP\nFigure by MIT OCW.\n\nQuestion 2, continued\nThe glycolysis pathway produces energy from glucose.\nd) In what molecule is this energy stored?\nATP\ne) Where in that molecule is the energy that is used to perform work stored? Be specific.\nIn ATP, the energy used to do work is stored in the phosphate bonds.\nBreakdown of the molecule (in d) is often coupled with other reactions in the cell, making the\nnew, coupled, reaction proceed at an appreciable rate.\nf) Describe one mechanism that is commonly used in such coupled reactions.\nOne common mechanism involves transferring the third phosphate of the ATP onto one of the\nreactants, thus raising its energy state such that the new, coupled reaction is now favorable.\nAnother mechanism involves performing ATP hydrolysis on the same enzyme, but in a different\nactive site than the reaction being catalyzed. In this mechanism, ATP hydrolysis often causes the\nenzyme to change conformation, allowing it to catalyze the main reaction.\nS. oxyphiliae is an organism that can undergo fermentation or respiration.\ng) You take equal aliquots of the same oxyphiliae culture and supply both with equal amount\nof food. You place aliquot A into an airtight bottle and aliquot B into an open shallow\ncontainer.\ni) Are the cells in cultures A and B deriving all of their energy in the same way?\nExplain.\nNo. Culture A derives all of its energy from glycolysis, while culture B derives additional energy\n(ATP) from Krebs cycle and oxidative phosphorylation.\nii) Will one culture run out of food faster? If yes, state which culture, and explain why.\nIf no, explain why not.\nYes. Because culture A derives all of its energy from glycolysis, it only produces 2 molecules of\nATP/molecule of glucose. Thus, it will have to utilize more glucose to perform same amount of\ncellular functions as culture B that derives 36 molecules of ATP/molecule of glucose through\nrespiration.\niii) At the time when both cultures run out of food, will there be approximately the\nsame number of cells in each? Why or why not?\nNo. Because culture B utilizes its food stores more efficiently, it will be able to maintain cellular\nfunctions for longer on the same amount of food. Therefore, it will have more time to divide, and\nit will have more cells than culture A.\nh) In the Krebs cycle itself, only one ATP molecule is generated per molecule of pyruvate. Yet\nwe know that respiration overall yields more additional ATP molecules. Beginning with\nthe products of the Krebs cycle, briefly outline how that additional ATP is generated.\nKrebs cycle is run in mitochnodria, where e- rich NADH and FADH2 unload electrons onto the\nelectron transport chain (ETC). As electrons are passed down the ETC, protons are pumped into the\nspace between the inner and outer membrane, forming gradient. Because of the gradient, it is\nfavorable for H+ to get back across the membrane. That proton motive force powers ATP synthase to\nadd a Pi to an ADP, creating ATP.\n\nQuestion 2, continued\ni) What is the main overall product of the dark reactions of photosynthesis?\nThe overall reaction of photosynthesis is 6CO2+6H2OÆC6H12O6(glucose) +6O2, and the main\nproduct is glucose.\nAll enzymatic reactions, including those in glycolysis and the Krebs cycle, are reversible.\nYou decide to study where in the cell glycolytic enzymes are found. You are surprised to find\nthat these enzymes are not only found in the cytoplasm, but also in chloroplasts.\nj) Explain why these enzymes are found in chloroplasts.\nIn the process of generating glucose from CO2, the cell runs some of the reactions of the glycolytic\npathway in reverse. Because all enzymatic reactions are reversible, enzymes used to run the\npathway backward in chloroplasts are the same that are used to run glycolysis in cytoplasm.\nk) Explain, in evolutionary terms, why two species that diverged billions of years ago still use\nmany of the same enzymes and reactions.\nOnce a pathway is developed, any mutant (M) of the pathway that accidentally arises is likely to be\nless efficient. Even if some descendant of M, M1, if it was to acquire another mutation, might end up\nbeing significantly better than the original non-mutant organism, M itself is not likely to survive or\ngenerate enough progeny to allow M1 to ever appear. Thus, evolutionary pressure works against\nchanges to key pathways, ensuring significant conservation throughout evolution.\nQuestion 3 (14 points)\nBelow is the energy diagram for the reaction C+D ÆA+B.\n∆G\nEa (∆G++)\nC+D\nA+B\nreaction progress\na) On the energy diagram above, label the following:\n-Ea (∆G++)\n-∆G\n-A+B\n-C+D\nb) Based on the diagram above,\n∆G<0\n∆G=0\n\n∆G>0\n\nQuestion 3, continued\nc) How would the enzyme change\ni) ∆G?\nExplain\n∆G is unffected by the presence of an enzyme. This is because it is a thermodynamic property of\nthe reaction, and is determined by the amount of energy available to perform the work of\nconverting reactants to products and vice versa. Since the energy is stored in the bonds, it is\nindependent of the path the reaction takes, or the rate at which it occurs.\nii) Ea (∆G++)?\nExplain\nActivation energy will be lower in the presence of the enzyme. Enzymes lower the activation\nenergy of the reaction, allowing it to proceed.\niii) speed of reaction?\nExplain\nThe rate of reaction is affected. Reactants reach the transition state due to random fluctuations in\nenergy caused by molecular motion. If Ea is lowered, much less energy is required to reach it, so\nmore molecules will be able to do so, and the rate of the reaction will increase.\nQuestion 4 (14 points)\nA popular line of research in developing environmentally cleaner and cheaper energy sources\nfocuses on biomass fuel, or using ethanol produced from organic sources as fuel. In order for\nthis approach to be economical, sources such as corn stover, wheat straw, wood chips and\nwaste paper would need to be converted to ethanol. All these potential sources are rich in\ncellulose, molecule depicted in the figure below.\nO\nH\nH\nH\nH\nOH\nO\nO\nO\nH\nH\nH\nH\nOH\nO\nO\nOH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nO\nO\nH\nH\nH\nH\nOH\nO\nCH 2OH\nH\nOH\nCH 2OH\nH\nOH\nH\nOH\nCH 2OH\nH\nOH\nCH 2OH\nCellulose\n(Unbranched polymer of Glucose in (\nβ 1\n4) linkage)\nA class of enzymes called cellulases that break down cellulose would be required to start the\nprocess of converting these materials into ethanol.\na) Starting with cellulose, briefly outline the pathway needed to produce ethanol.\nThe pathway will be\nCelluloseÆ glucoseÆpyruvateÆethanol.\n\nQuestion 4, continued\nIn the 1990's a group of researchers, called bioprospectors, set out to find bacteria that could\nhelp in the production of biomass fuel. For biomass fuel production, cellulases would have to\nremain functional in the harsh conditions used by industry (high temperature and acidity).\nTo isolate thermo- and pH-stable cellulases, bacteria from several sources were examined.\nb) Among the possible sources of bacteria listed below, choose the one you believe to be the\nmost likely to produce cellulases stable at high temperature and low pH. For your choice,\nlist the strong and weak points.\n- Cow rumen (stomach)\n- Human stomach\n- Tree bark\n- Acidic springs near active volcanoes\nAcidic springs near active volcanoes would provide high temperature and low pH environments. Thus,\nif these bacteria express cellulases, these cellulases should be stable in conditions used by the industry.\nThe weak point of this choice is that we do not a priori know whether bacteria living in this environment\nwould have evolved to produce cellulases. If their environment is nor rich in cellulose, but is rich in\nother organic sugars, these bacteria might not express cellulases.\nThe bioprospectors eventually isolated the bacteria Acidothermus cellulolyticus in Yellowstone\nNational Park. These bacteria secrete cellulases that function optimally at 80°C and pH 5,\nconditions that denature most proteins.\nc) What type of bond might help stabilize the protein tertiary structure under such\nconditions?\nWe can expect that disulfide bonds would stabilize proteins under these harsh conditions.\nBacteria do not produce enough cellulases for industrial applications. Scientists are now\nattempting to make high levels of the cellulases in plants for more efficient production.\nHowever, active cellulases can not be produced in plants without destroying the plant.\nCellulases have multiple subunits, and when each subunit is manufactured in a separate plant,\nthe plants are not destroyed.\nd) Explain why manufacturing the entire enzyme in plants destroys the plants, whereas\nmanufacturing separate subunits does not.\nBecause plants are rich in cellulose, expressing massive quantities of the enzyme in a plant would\ncause the active enzyme to break down cellulose in the cell, and eventually destroy the plant.\nEach subunit separately does not have catalytic activity, so none of them separately would destroy\ntheir host plant.\nOnce all subunits are purified separately and assembled together in the test tube, the entire enzyme\nshould demonstrate catalytic activity."

On his ship, hidden in the Stata building, you find alien bacteria that\nmetabolize wood. You call this species A. termiticus, and call your original strain BLT (for\n\"Barney's little termiticus\").\n\nYou subject a sample of BLT to mutagens, and isolate a new strain that no longer metabolizes\nwood. You conclude that you have succeeded in disrupting at least one gene necessary to\nmetabolize wood. You call the mutant strain M.\n\nYou mix a sample of M with a sample of heat-killed wild type BLT, and the resulting strain\nmetabolizes wood. You summarize your data in the following table:\n\nStrains\nMetabolizes wood?\nBLT\nYes\nHeat-killed BLT\nNo\nM\nNo\nHeat-killed BLT +M\nYes\n\na) Did the content of any of the BLT or M cells change in the experiment? If yes, which cells\nunderwent the change, and what change occured? If not, explain why there was no change.\n\nYou plan to characterize the alien genetic material. You start by breaking some A. termiticus\ncells open to determine their molecular composition. You find that they contain various small\nmolecules, carbohydrates, lipids, and two other macromolecules, A and B.\n\nIn order to determine which macromolecule is the carrier of genetic information, you repeat\nyour previous experiment, but include test tubes where you treat the sample of the heat-killed\nBLT with either an agent that destroys macromolecule A (A-ase) or macromolecule B (B-ase).\nYou find the following results (including the repeat of your previous experiment in the first 4\nlines):\n\nStrains and agents\nMetabolizes wood?\nBLT\nYes\nHeat-killed BLT\nNo\nM\nNo\nHeat-killed BLT +M\nYes\nA-ase treated heat-killed BLT +M\nYes\nB-ase treated heat-killed BLT +M\nNo\n\nb) Which molecule is the carrier of genetic information in A. termiticus? Justify your answer.\n\nName:________________________________________\n\nTA:____________________\n\nQuestion 1, continued\n\nNext, you set out to determine the structure of the alien genetic material molecule. You first\ndetermine that it has six types of bases that you name S, V, W, X, Y, Z. You further determine\nthat the alien cell's content of S is the same as its content of each of X and Z; and that the\ncontent of V is the same as its content of each of W and Y.\n\nWhen you determine the structure of this molecule by X-ray crystallography, you are not\nsurprised to find that the molecule consists of 3 interacting strands.\n\nc) What base interaction combinations do you expect for this molecule?\n\nYou want to investigate the mechanism of replication of the alien genetic material. You decide\nto repeat the Meselson-Stahl experiment. Recall that labeled strands are \"heavy\" (low in the\ngradient) and unlabeled strands are \"light\" (high in the gradient). Also recall that in the\nexperiment, the culture is grown on heavy Nitrogen (15N), and is switched to light Nitrogen\n(14N) at time=0.\n\nBefore proceeding you define three possible models of alien replication:\n- conservative, in which, after replication, old strands stay together, and new molecules\nare made entirely of new strands;\n- semi-conservative, in which, after replication, each molecule has one old strand; and\n- asymmetric, in which replication creates a molecule with one new strand, and a\nmolecule with two new strands.\n\nEach column in the table below reflects the predictions one of these models makes about the\noutcome of the experiment.

On his ship, hidden in the Stata building, you find alien bacteria that\nmetabolize wood. You call this species A. termiticus, and call your original strain BLT (for\n\"Barney's little termiticus\").\nYou subject a sample of BLT to mutagens, and isolate a new strain that no longer metabolizes\nwood. You conclude that you have succeeded in disrupting at least one gene necessary to\nmetabolize wood. You call the mutant strain M.\nYou mix a sample of M with a sample of heat-killed wild type BLT, and the resulting strain\nmetabolizes wood. You summarize your data in the following table:\nStrains\nMetabolizes wood?\nBLT\nYes\nHeat-killed BLT\nNo\nM\nNo\nHeat-killed BLT +M\nYes\na) Did the content of any of the BLT or M cells change in the experiment? If yes, which cells\nunderwent the change, and what change occured? If not, explain why there was no change.\nSome cells of type M underwent the change. They acquired some of the genetic material from the heat-\nkilled BLT cells. In particular, some part of the genetic material they acquired encoded for the gene that\nwas mutated in M. Having received this gene, M cells now behave like the wild-type BLT cells because\nthey can now produce the agent (like the Earth proteins) that restores the wood metabolism pathway.\nYou plan to characterize the alien genetic material. You start by breaking some A. termiticus\ncells open to determine their molecular composition. You find that they contain various small\nmolecules, carbohydrates, lipids, and two other macromolecules, A and B.\nIn order to determine which macromolecule is the carrier of genetic information, you repeat\nyour previous experiment, but include test tubes where you treat the sample of the heat-killed\nBLT with either an agent that destroys macromolecule A (A-ase) or macromolecule B (B-ase).\nYou find the following results (including the repeat of your previous experiment in the first 4\nlines):\nStrains and agents\nMetabolizes wood?\nBLT\nYes\nHeat-killed BLT\nNo\nM\nNo\nHeat-killed BLT +M\nYes\nA-ase treated heat-killed BLT +M\nYes\nB-ase treated heat-killed BLT +M\nNo\nb) Which molecule is the carrier of genetic information in A. termiticus? Justify your answer.\nB is the carrier of genetic information in the alien organism. This is because when the BLT cells are\ntreated with B-ase, no B remains in the sample, and, as a result, no transformation occurs. On the other\nhand, treatment with A-ase has no bearing on the transformation ability of the heat-killed BLT cells. We,\ntherefore, must conclude that B is the carrier of genetic information.\n\nName:________________________________________\n\nTA:____________________\nQuestion 1, continued\nNext, you set out to determine the structure of the alien genetic material molecule. You first\ndetermine that it has six types of bases that you name S, V, W, X, Y, Z. You further determine\nthat the alien cell's content of S is the same as its content of each of X and Z; and that the\ncontent of V is the same as its content of each of W and Y.\nWhen you determine the structure of this molecule by X-ray crystallography, you are not\nsurprised to find that the molecule consists of 3 interacting strands.\nc) What base interaction combinations do you expect for this molecule?\nBased on the data, we expect S on one strand to interact with X on another strand and Z on the third\nstrand. We would also expect V on one strand to interact with W on another strand and Y on the third\nstrand.\n(\nYou want to investigate the mechanism of replication of the alien genetic material. You decide\nto repeat the Meselson-Stahl experiment. Recall that labeled strands are \"heavy\" (low in the\ngradient) and unlabeled strands are \"light\" (high in the gradient). Also recall that in the\nexperiment, the culture is grown on heavy Nitrogen (15N), and is switched to light Nitrogen\n14N) at time=0.\nBefore proceeding you define three possible models of alien replication:\n- conservative, in which, after replication, old strands stay together, and new molecules\nare made entirely of new strands;\n- semi-conservative, in which, after replication, each molecule has one old strand; and\n- asymmetric, in which replication creates a molecule with one new strand, and a\nmolecule with two new strands.\nEach column in the table below reflects the predictions one of these models makes about the\noutcome of the experiment. The outcomes are described using symbols a-d to indicate the\nlevels on the gradient as depicted in the figure on the right.\nd) Label each column with the name of the appropriate model.\na\nb\nc\nd\n# cycles of\nreplication\nAsymmetric\nConservative\nSemi-\nconservative\nd\nd\nd\nb, c\na, d\nb\na, b, c\na, d\na, b\na, b, c\na, d\na, b\nYou determine that each A. termiticus mother cell completes one round of genetic material\nreplication, but gives rise to three daughter cells.\ne) Which of the above models is not consistent with this data? Why?\nIn order to create three daughter cells, replication must produce three molecules of genetic material per\ncycle. Asymmetric model predicts creation of only two molecules of genetic material in each replication\ncycle. Therefore, asymmetric model is not consistent with data.\n\nX\nName:________________________________________\nTA:____________________\nQuestion 1, continued\nBelow are the structures of an alien nucleotide X and the earth DNA nucleotide cytosine (C).\n‐O\n‐O\n‐O\nS\nO\nS\nO\nS\n‐O\nO\n‐O\n‐O\n‐O\nNH2\nNH2\nN\nO\nO\nO\nN\nO\nO‐\nP\nO\nP\nO\nP\n5' O\nO‐\nO‐\nO‐\n3'\nOH\nf) For both structures,\ni. box the sugar\nii. circle the base\niii. underline the part of the structure used to power the addition of the nucleotide onto the\ngrowing chain.\ng) For the DNA nucleotide,\ni. label the 5' end\nii. label the 3' end\niii. draw an arrow to the part of the molecule that identifies it as a nucleotide used in DNA\nrather than in RNA.\n\nName:________________________________________\n\nTA:____________________\nQuestion 2 (30 points)\na) Transcription\ni. is the process that transfers information from ___DNA____ to ____RNA___.\nii. in eukaryotic organisms, transcription occurs in the\nNucleus\nRibosome\n\nRibosome\n\nMembrane\nb) Translation\ni. is the process that transfers information from ____RNA___ to __protein _.\nii. in eukaryotic organisms, translation occurs in the\nNucleus\nMembrane\nThe following sequence of DNA encodes a hypothetical polypeptide called Playdo in a\nhypothetical bacteria E. hypotheticus.

Be sure to label the N- and\nC- termini.\nN-Met-Asp-Gly-C\ne) How many total amino acids are encoded in this polypeptide?\nThe gene encodes 10 amino acids. The 11th in-frame codon is the stop codon UAA.\nYou identify a strain of bacteria containing a mutant tRNA that is capable of adding a\ntryptophan residue when it recognizes the codon UAG in the mRNA.\nf) What is the sequence of the anticodon of the mutant tRNA? Be sure to label the 5' and 3'\nends.\n3'-AUC-5' or 5'-CUA-3'\n\nName:________________________________________\n\nTA:____________________\nQuestion 2, continued\nlonger\ng) The Playdo polypeptide would be the same length in the presence of the mutant tRNA.\nshorter\n\nWhy?\nThe length of Playdo would be the same in the presense of the mutant tRNA because the Playdo gene\nsequence does not include the TAG, so the mutant tRNA would never be used in translating Playdo\nYou isolate a mutant bacteria with the Playdo gene sequence below. The bold, boxed G/C base\npair is the site of the only difference between wild-type and mutant Playdo--a substitution of\na G/C base pair for a A/T base pair. As before, the bold C/G base pair indicates the start of\ntranscription, and the underlined T/A base pair indicates the terminator.\n5'-TTCCCCTATGGGTGGTCATCTACGATGCCCCCATCACTAAAGCTTG-3'\n3'-AAGGGGATACCCACCAGTAGATGCTACGGGGGTAGTGATTTCGAAC-5'\nh) What is the effect of this substitution on the peptide?\nThe second amino acid in the peptide, Asp, is changed to Gly in this mutant variant.\ni) Do you expect this peptide to have the same function as the wild-type bacterial peptide?\nWhy or why not?\nWe would not expect the mutant Playdo to function like the wild-type peptide. This is because the\nmutant peptide now has Gly in place of Asp. Asp is a charged amino acid, while Gly is not charged. In\naddition, Asp is significantly larger than Gly, which has the smallest side chain of all the amino acids.\nThis substitution is likely to affect tertiary structure of Playdo, and, therefore, to alter its function.\nIntrigued by Playdo, you search for a similar protein in mice by looking for similar DNA\nsequences in the mouse genome. You find a gene that matches bacterial Playdo almost\nperfectly but contains a 36 DNA base pair insertion in the center of it.\nWhen you purify the Playdo polypetide from mouse cells you are shocked to learn that\nmouse Playdo is the same length in amino acids as bacterial Playdo.\nj) Explain how is it possible that mouse Playdo and bacterial Playdo are the same\npolypeptide length even though they have substantially different gene lengths.\nMouse genes have introns--regions of DNA within the coding sequence of a gene that do not get\ntranslated. These regions are spliced out of the initial transcript when mRNA is prepared. The 36 extra\nbase pairs in the mouse gene are such an intron.\nk) Do you expect bacterial and mouse Playdo to have the same promoter and terminator\nsequences? Why or why not?\nThe promoter and terminator sequences belong to a language written in DNA that is \"read\" by the\ntranscription machinery. This language is not universal, but is species-specific. Therefore, we would not\nexpect bacteria and mouse to have the same promoter and terminator sequences.\n\nName:________________________________________\nTA:____________________\nQuestion 3 (25 points)\na) Which of the following could alter gene regulation (circle all that apply)\ni.

Chinchillas with Velvet coats\nhave especially thick, soft hair.\n\nYour first hypothesis is that the Velvet (coat thickness) is an autosomal trait.\n\na) Draw and label a diagram of a Chinchilla cell right before the first meiotic division.\nPretend for the moment that chinchillas only have two pairs of chromosomes both of which\nare autosomal. Your cell should be heterozygous at the Velvet locus. Make sure to label\neach allele, using A to indicate the dominant allele and a to indicate the recessive allele.\n\nYou reason that the rare Velvet coat phenotype of your female is recessive to the Standard coat\nphenotype of your male. Your male comes from a long line of show quality Standards, so you\nfeel safe assuming that he is homozygous at the Velvet locus.\n\nb) You cross you Standard male and Velvet female. If your assumptions are correct, what coat\nphenotypes would you expect to see in the\ni. F1 generation?\n\nii. F2 generation?\n\nIn your F1 offspring you find chinchillas of both sexes with Standard coats and a lot of males\nwith Velvet coats.

Why or why\nnot?\n\nYou confirm with the use of internet that only one autosomal gene is involved in the Velvet\ncoat phenotype. Your friend now suggests two more hypotheses consistent with this fact:\n(1) your Standard is actually heterozygous at the velvet locus (Aa), while your Velvet is\nhomozygous (aa).\n(2) your Velvet is actually heterozygous (Aa), and your Standard is homozygous (AA).\n\nRecall that the parental cross (Standard X Velvet) gave a mix of Standard and Velvet coats.\nTo determine which hypothesis above is correct, you do the following two crosses and get the\nfollowing results:\n\nCross 1:\nF1 Standard X P Standard\n\nCross 2:\nF1 Velvet X P Velvet\n\n↓\n\n↓\nOffspring: All Standard\n\nOffspring: Velvet and Standard\n\ne) These results support hypothesis number ____\nExplain your choice.\n\nName:________________________________________\n\nTA:____________________\n\nQuestion 3, continued\n\nf) After repeating cross 2 a number of times, the overall ratio of progeny is 1 Standard to 2\nVelvet. Explain this result.\n\nSince Standard coat animals do not sell for as much as Velvet animals, you buy several females\nwith Brown Velvet coats to mate with your Grey Velvet males. Brown is dominant over Grey.\nHowever, you are not sure whether the Brown Velvet females you bought are pure breeding at\nthe coat color locus.\n\nYou know that two unlinked genes are involved with these phenotypes-- one for coat color\n(B/b), and one for Velvet coat thickness (A/a).

This is shown above.\na) You treat cells carrying out respiration with a saturating dose of drug X, so that all the\nelectrons which would normally continue along the pathway are captured by drug X. Under\nthese conditions:\n- Will the cells continue to consume O2?\n- Will the cells continue to produce CO2?\n- Will the rate of ATP synthesis increase or decrease or stay the same?\n\nExplain your reasoning.\nb) You treat cells carrying out respiration with a saturating dose of drug Y, so that all the\nelectrons which would normally continue along the pathway are captured by drug Y. Under\nthese conditions:\n- Will the cells continue to consume O2?\n- Will the cells continue to produce CO2?\n- Will the rate of ATP synthesis increase or decrease or stay the same?\n\nExplain your reasoning.\n\nQuestion 2\nAgrobacterium tumefaciens is a bacterium that infects a wide range of broad-leaved plants. Most\nof the Agrobacterium genes are found on its large chromosome, but some of the genes that\nallow this bacterium to infect plant cells are found on the bacterial Ti plasmid. During\ninfection, the bacterium transfers the Ti plasmid DNA to the plant and the plasmid DNA is\nintegrated into the genome of the plant. This new DNA encodes plant hormones that stimulate\ncell division of the infected cells. This excessive cell division produces a tumor.\nThe Ti plasmid also carries the genes responsible for opine production. Opines are modified\namino acids that only plant cells infected with Agrobacteria produce. These opines can be used\nby Agrobacteria as the SOLE carbon and energy source, and are not used by other organisms.\na) Circle the correct answer...\nAgrobacterium is an autotroph or a heterotroph.\nb) For the Ti plasmid DNA to have an effect within the plant cell, an appropriate promoter\nmust be included for each gene.\ni) What is a promoter?\nii) Describe the potential problem(s) of trying to express genes from a eukaryote in a\nprokaryote.\niii) Would the genes carried on the Agrobacterium Ti plasmid have a prokaryotic or\neukaryotic promoter? Why?\niv) What is the likely origin of the Ti plasmid DNA sequences?\nThe major staple food for hundreds of millions of people is rice. However, rice lacks\ncarotenoids that are converted into beta-carotene, a precursor of vitamin A. Millions of people\nsuffer from vitamin A deficiencies. Rice has most of the biochemical pathway for producing\nbeta-carotene, but is lacking two enzymes. Using Agrobacterium tumefaciens and modified Ti\nplasmids, scientists have created rice plants that have the needed enzymes and can make beta-\ncarotene. These plants produce yellowish colored rice grains, called Golden Rice, which is high\nin beta-carotene.\n\nQuestion 2, continued\nTo create Golden Rice plants, two different Ti plasmids were made. In the first case, the Ti\nplasmid carried the crt1 gene from the bacterium E. uredovora. The other Ti plasmid carried\nthe daffodil gene psy2. You want to recreate the first of these modified Ti plasmids.\nc) You are given E. uredovora genomic DNA and want to use this to make a library in E. coli\ncells. You purchase the following cloning vector for use in constructing your library. It\nencodes the gene for ampicillin resistance (ampR).\nCloning\nampR\n3000 bp\nPvuII\nEcoRI\nPvuII: 5'-CAG|CTG-3'\nEcoRI cuts:\n5'-G|AATTC-3'\n3'-GTC|GAC-5'\n3'-CTTAA|G-5'\nori\ni) With what enzyme will you cut your cloning vector?\nEcoRI\nii) With what enzyme will you cut your genomic DNA?\nd) You successfully cut both your genomic DNA and your cloning vector. You mix them\ntogether and add DNA ligase.\ni) In what other cellular process have we encountered DNA ligase?\nii) What does DNA ligase do?\ne) You transform E. coli cells with your ligated DNA to make a library.\ni) The E. coli cells that you use for transformation should have what phenotype prior to\nbeing transformed?\nii) Once transformed, how do you isolate the E. coli cells that have a plasmid away from\nthe E. coli cells that don't have a plasmid?\nf) You successfully create a wild type genomic DNA library from E. uredovora.\nAssume that production of beta-carotene is essential for growth of E. uredovora cells on\nminimal media. How could you use your library to clone the crt1 gene by complementation?\n\nQuestion 3\nTake the following simple ecosystem enclosed in a fish tank:\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\np\nh erb\nr\nr\ngr\nrotr\nh ytoplan kton\niv o ou s\nfish\nwate\nav el\nh ete\noph ic\nbacteria\n- th e on ly en ergy in pu t is ligh t\n- th e fish eat on ly th e ph ytoplan kton\n- h u m an s h arv est th e fish\n- n oth in g eats th e bacteria\n- th e wh ole tan k, in clu din g th e\nsedim en ts, is aerobic\n(on e species)\na) Construct an energy flow model for this ecosystem.\ni) Label all compartments and products\nii) assign a different label to each of the energy flows\niii) describe what each energy flow represents.\nb) Suppose you added a worm to this ecosystem that only consumes waste produced by the\nfish. What would be the effect on the level of respiration by the heterotrophic bacteria\n(increase, decrease, stay the same) of adding this worm to the tank, if the worm's waste and\ndetritus was not consumed by the detritivores. Explain your reasoning briefly.\nc) Suppose you added a worm to this ecosystem that only consumes waste produced by the\nfish. What would be the effect on bacterial respiration (increase, decrease, stay the same) of\nadding this worm to the tank, if the worm's waste was consumed by the detritivores.

In the experiment below, you add phosphate\nfertilizer to a pond. You see a brief period of growth of most organisms followed by a large\nbloom of cyanobacteria.

Body color (brown or black) is controlled by the\nb locus and wing size (long or short) is controlled by the vg locus. Use (+) for the alleles\nassociated with the dominant characteristics, (b or vg) for the alleles associated with the\nrecessive traits.\nIn cross 1, you mate two pure-breeding strains and obtain the following progeny:\ncross 1:\nbrown, short-winged male X black, long-winged female\nF1:\nall brown, long-winged flies\na) Which phenotypes are dominant and which phenotypes are recessive?\ni) The recessive trait for body color is______________.\nii) The recessive trait for wing size is______________.\nb) In cross 2, you then mate many pairs of siblings from the F1 generation of cross 1:\ncross 2:\nF1 sibling male\nX\nF1 sibling female\nWhat genotypic and phenotypic ratios would you expect in the progeny (F2) of these crosses if\nindependent assortment occurs?\nThe compiled progeny results from the cross 2 mating pairs are presented below:\nF2:\nPhenotype\n\n# identified\n\nbrown, large-winged\n\nblack, large-winged\n\nbrown, short-winged\nblack, short-winged\nc) From this data, what might you conclude about these two loci?\nd) What alleles are carried on each chromosome of each fly in cross 1?\ne) You perform test crosses with F1 flies and homozygous recessive flies.\ni) If the b and the vg genes are 100% linked, what phenotypes do you expect?\nii) The actual data from these crosses is shown below:\nProgeny:\nPhenotype\n\n# identified\n\nbrown, large-winged\n\nblack, large-winged\n\nbrown, small-winged\n\nblack, small-winged\n\nCalculate the recombination frequency between the body color and wing size loci:\nQuestion 6\nFor the following human pedigrees, a-c, determine:\ni) the most likely mode of inheritance of the following traits (dominant or recessive and\nautosomal or sex-linked),\nii) the probable genotype of the individual marked with an asterisk (*).\nAssume that individuals that marry into the family do not have the defective allele.

A\neukaryotic promoter will not be recognized by prokaryotic RNA polymerase, so the\neukaryotic gene is not transcribed.\n2) Eukaryotic genes often have introns. An inton is a region of DNA that deso not\nencode protein and is spliced out of the transcript prior to translation. Prokaryotic\norganisms do not have introns and can not remove them from the transcript so the\nprotein produced would not be correct.\niii)\nThe genes on the Ti plasmid are expressed in plant cells so they must have\neukaryotic promoters.\niv)\nThe Ti DNA sequences encode plant hormones, so they likely came originally from a\nplant.\nc)\ni)\nPvuII\nii)\nPvuII or any other restriction enzyme that leaves blunt ends.\nd)\ni)\nDNA Replication of lagging strand\nii)\nForms a phosphodiester bond between the 3' OH and the 5' phosphate of two DNA\nfragments.\ne)\ni)\nThe E. coli cells prior to transformation must be sensitive to ampicillin.\nii)\nThe E. coli cells that are transformed can be grown on media containing ampicillin.\nOnly cells that carry a plasmid will survive.\nf) You would have or create E. uredovora cells that are missing the crt1 gene (crt1- cells).\nThese cells will not grow on minimal medium. These crt1- cells can then be transformed with\nthe plasmids from the library, and transformed cells would be grown on minimal media. Only\ncells with the wild type crt1 gene will grow.\n\nQuestion 3\nRA\nPgross\nP\nB\nFish Harvest\nB = biomass\nD = detritus\nF = feces\nI = ingestion\nA = assimilation\nP = production\nR = respiration\nI = A + F\nA = R + P\nRH\nRH\nA\nI\nF\nphytoplankton\nFish\nheterotrophic\nbacteria\nB\nB\nD\nD\nP\n1 = GPP: gross CO2 fixation\n2 = phytoplankton respiration\n3 = NPP: net primary production by phytoplankton\n4 = phytoplankton eaten by fish\n5 = phytoplankton detritus (phytoplankton that die before being eaten)\n6 = fish respiration\n7 = fish waste (feces)\n8 = net production by fish\n9 = fish that die without being harvested\n10 = fish harvest\n11 = respiration by detritivores (bacteria)\nb) Decrease. Now two organisms compete for fish waste (7), so the detritivores necessarily consume a\nsmaller portion of (7) than without a competitor.\nc) Decrease, but decrease not as large as in (e). The two organisms still compete for fish detritus (7),\nnow however the worm returns some part (necessarily less than 100%) of the portion of (7) it consumes\nas worm detritus.\nlight\n\nQuestion 4\na) Which of the above element(s) are limiting at each of the following times?\ni) At time (1)? Explain your reasoning.\nPhosphate. We see that simply adding PO4\n3- is sufficient to cause growth of most organisms.\nThis indicates that PO4\n3- was limiting.\nii) At time (4)? Explain your reasoning.\nNitrogen. We see from the graph that PO4\n3- levels remain high, but nitrogen levels have\ndecreased, and the biomass of organisms is no longer increasing.\nb) Why is the [NO3\n-] in the water decreasing at time (2)?\nAs the biomass of organisms increases, so does the need for nitrogen, which is being used to form\nbiomolecules, such as proteins, DNA, etc.\nc) Why are the cyanobacteria at an advantage at time (4)?\nCyanobacteria can fix atmospheric N2 into organic N and thus are not limited by the decreasing\n-\nnitrogen (NO3 ) levels.\nQuestion 5\na)\ni) The recessive trait for body color is black.\nii) The recessive trait for wing size is short-winged .\nb) You would expect ratios of:\n9 brown, large-winged\n\nblack,\n\nlarge-winged\n\nbrown,\n\nshort-winged\n\nblack,\n\nshort-winged\n\nc) The genes are not segregating independently because you do not obtain a 9:3:3:1 ratio.

For this part, you are not limited\nto the list above.\nb) For a number of the metabolisms above, the electron source is the same as the energy\nsource. Explain why they are not the same for photosynthesis.\nThe energy source in photosynthesis is light. While other energy sources are also sources of electrons\n(e.g. sugar), the energy source of photosynthesis, light, does not contain electrons. Therefore, organisms\nusing light as an energy source must use a different source of electrons.\ndonor\nc) Organisms carrying out respiration need a final electron acceptor\nto keep the electron\ntransport chain (ETC) functional. (Circle the correct term above.)\nExplain how this compound enables the ETC to remain functional.\nThe final electron acceptor removes the electrons after they have traveled the length of the ETC. This\nthen frees the last protein in the ETC to pull the next pair of electrons from the next to last protein in the\nchain. The newly freed protein can in turn pull the electrons from (only slightly) less electronegative\nprotein.\nIf no final acceptor existed, the ETC would get \"backed up\" by accumulating electrons to capacity on\never less electronegative proteins. This back up would propagate to eventually saturate all proteins in\nthe chain.\nHaving a final electron acceptor relieves this potential problem.\n\nName:________________________________________\nTA:____________________\nQuestion 1, continued\nd) Using an argument based on redox and energetics, explain how aerobic respiration\ngenerates more ATP per molecule of glucose than anaerobic respiration.\nO2 is the electron acceptor used in aerobic respiration. All the possible electron acceptors used in\nanaerobic respiration are less electronegative than O2. That means that each of these acceptors would\noperate with a shorter electron transport chain than O2. A shorter chain would include fewer proton\npumps, so a smaller number of protons will be pumped in such a chain per molecule of NADH (and,\nconsequently, per molecule of glucose). ATP synthase makes a new molecule of ATP for each proton\npumped by the ETC. Therefore, a chain with as a final acceptor will produce more ATP per molecule of\nglucose than a chain with any acceptor used in anaerobic respiration.\nQuestion 2 (22 points)\nBaby Jill is stuck on an uninhabited island. The food web quickly comes to look like this:\nIn this web,\nPlants\nMice\nFerrets\nBaby Jill\nDetritus\nNPP (plants)=200 kg/day\nIM (Mice ingestion) = 20kg/day\nMice AE (assimilation efficiency) = 20%\nMice PE (production efficiency) =10%\nFerret EE (exploitation efficiency) = 50%\nFerret AE = 80%\nFerret PE = 10%\nBaby Jill EE = 40%\nBaby Jill AE = 80%\nBaby Jill PE =10%\n\nName:________________________________________\n\nTA:____________________\nQuestion 2, continued\na) Suppose that shortly after baby Jill's arrival the flow into the refractory carbon pool in the\nsystem decreased. Why was there a decrease?\nJill starts consuming ferrets, which prevents these ferrets from ending up in detritus. Jill herself spends\nmuch of the energy she gets from the ferrets in respiration, so that energy is lost to the system. Since the\ndetritivores now have less biomass to start with, less ends up in refractory carbon.\nNote that this analysis works only in the short term. Longer term, mice not eaten by ferrets eaten by Jill\nmay provide enough biomass to the detritus trophic level to increase the flow to refractory carbon.\nb) How many grams/day of carbon are stored in the form of ferrets? Show your work.\nIM x AEM x PEM x EEF x AEF x PEF=20,000g/day x .2 x.1 x .5 x .8 x .1 =16 g/day\nc) Given only the information on the previous page, is it possible to calculate the mean\nresidence time of carbon in the ferret trophic level? Why or why not?\nMean Residence Time (MRT) is defined as pool/flux. While it is possible to calculate flux (as we did\nabove), we do not know how big the ferret biomass pool is. Therefore, we can not calculate MRT given\nonly the information on the previous page.\nSuppose baby Jill gave ferrets a drug that lets them increase biomass faster on the same\namount of food.\nd) What system parameter(s) could have changed as a result? (circle all that apply)\nNPP\nPEJ\nAEJ\nGPP\nEEF\nPEF\nAEF\nWhy?\nFerrets are consuming the same amount of food as before, so their Exploitation efficiency, or any other\nparameter that precedes it in the web would not be affected. The two possibilities are that the drug\nenables the ferrets to assimilate the food they consume more efficiently (AEF) or that it enables the ferrets\nto utilize the energy derived from food more efficiently (PEF).\nBaby Jill finds some squash seeds and plants them on a previously vegetation-free lot. She is\ntired of eating ferrets, so she plans to eat squash exclusively when it is ready. Note that Jill is\nthe only one on the island who will get to eat squash.\ne) In the table below, for each system parameter listed, circle Yes or No to indicate whether\nthat parameter will change once Jill plants and begins eating squash. For ONLY the\nparameters you believe will change, explain why in the space provided.\nParameter Change?\nJustify\nNPP\nYes\nNo There is a new primary producer in the system, so the NPP increases.\nEEJ\nYes\nNo Jill can consume entire squash, as opposed to portions of ferrets.\nPEJ\nYes\nNo\nAEJ\nYes\nNo Ferrets are closer in composition to Jill than squash is, so AE should decrease.\nGPP\nYes\nNo There is a new primary producer in the system, so the GPP increases.\nEEF\nYes\nNo\nAEF\nYes\nNo\nEEM\nYes\nNo\nAEM\nYes\nNo\n\nName:________________________________________\nTA:____________________\nQuestion 3 (30 points)\nYou hope to use your hard-won 7.014 knowledge to make some extra cash over the summer,\nso you adopt two Chinchillas to start a Chinchilla breeding business.\nYour Chinchillas are Standard male and a rare Velvet female. Chinchillas with Velvet coats\nhave especially thick, soft hair.\nYour first hypothesis is that the Velvet (coat thickness) is an autosomal trait.\na) Draw and label a diagram of a Chinchilla cell right before the first meiotic division.\nPretend for the moment that chinchillas only have two pairs of chromosomes both of which\nare autosomal. Your cell should be heterozygous at the Velvet locus. Make sure to label\neach allele, using A to indicate the dominant allele and a to indicate the recessive allele.\nA\na\na\nYou reason that the rare Velvet coat phenotype of your female is recessive to the Standard coat\nphenotype of your male. Your male comes from a long line of show quality Standards, so you\nfeel safe assuming that he is homozygous at the Velvet locus.\nb) You cross you Standard male and Velvet female. If your assumptions are correct, what coat\nphenotypes would you expect to see in the\ni. F1 generation?\nAll Standard\nii. F2 generation?\n3 Standard to 1 Velvet\nIn your F1 offspring you find chinchillas of both sexes with Standard coats and a lot of males\nwith Velvet coats. Your buddy from 7.014 suggests that, in contrast to your previous\nhypothesis, the Velvet phenotype is recessive and sex-linked. Chinchilla sex chromosomes are\nnamed X and Y and behave like human sex chromosomes.\n\nName:________________________________________\n\nTA:____________________\nQuestion 3, continued\nc) Suppose that your buddy is right and the Velvet gene is on the X chromosome. For the\nparental cross below, fill in the parental genotypes of your Velvet female and Standard\nmale. Use XA and Xa notation.\nIn the F1, fill in genotypes and phenotypes of the expected offspring.\n♀____Xa Xa __________ X ______XA Y___________ ♂\n↓\nF1:\n♀ Xa XA\nall Standard\n♂ XaY\nall Velvet\nAmong the F1 progeny, you find a lone Velvet female.\nd) Is the recessive sex-linked inheritance pattern still possible given this data? Why or why\nnot?\nAs shown in the predictions above, all females in F1 should be heterozygous for the Velvet allele, and,\ntherefore, should display Standard phenotype. Presence of Velvet female disproves the sex-linked\nrecessive hypothesis.\nYou confirm with the use of internet that only one autosomal gene is involved in the Velvet\ncoat phenotype. Your friend now suggests two more hypotheses consistent with this fact:\n(1) your Standard is actually heterozygous at the velvet locus (Aa), while your Velvet is\nhomozygous (aa).\n(2) your Velvet is actually heterozygous (Aa), and your Standard is homozygous (AA).\nRecall that the parental cross (Standard X Velvet) gave a mix of Standard and Velvet coats.\nTo determine which hypothesis above is correct, you do the following two crosses and get the\nfollowing results:\nCross 1:\nF1 Standard X P Standard\nCross 2:\nF1 Velvet X P Velvet\n↓\n↓\nOffspring: All Standard\nOffspring: Velvet and Standard\ne) These results support hypothesis number _2___\nExplain your choice.\nHypothesis 1 would predict that cross 1 would produce some individuals with Velvet phenotype, and\ncross 2 would produce all Velvet offspring. The data do not support this hypothesis.\nHypothesis 2 would predict all Standard progeny in cross 1 and a mix in cross 2, so hypothesis 2 agrees\nwith the data.\n\nName:________________________________________\n\nTA:____________________\nQuestion 3, continued\nf) After repeating cross 2 a number of times, the overall ratio of progeny is 1 Standard to 2\nVelvet. Explain this result.\nThe ratio indicates that the homozygous aa genotype is lethal. We would expect 1AA:2Aa:1aa ratio of\ngenotypes. That ratio can only correspond to the 1Standard : 2 Velvet ratio of phenotypes if the aa\ngenotype is lethal and is not observed in the cross.\nSince Standard coat animals do not sell for as much as Velvet animals, you buy several females\nwith Brown Velvet coats to mate with your Grey Velvet males. Brown is dominant over Grey.\nHowever, you are not sure whether the Brown Velvet females you bought are pure breeding at\nthe coat color locus.\nYou know that two unlinked genes are involved with these phenotypes-- one for coat color\n(B/b), and one for Velvet coat thickness (A/a). After a few years of mating the original pairs,\nyou find they have produced the following offspring:\n10 Standard Grey\n28 Grey Velvet\n13 Standard Brown\n24 Brown Velvet\ng) For the parental cross above, fill in the parental genotypes at the coat color and coat\nthickness loci of your Brown Velvet females and your Grey Velvet males.\n♀_____BbAa__________ X ________bbAa_______ ♂\nh) Give the phenotype for each of the possible F1 genotypes below:\nBbAA\nStandard Brown\nbbAA\nStandard Grey\nBbAa\nBrown Velvet\nbbAa\nGrey Velvet\nBbaa\ndead (never born--embryonic lethal)\nBbaa\ndead (never born--embryonic lethal)\n\nName:________________________________________\nTA:____________________\nQuestion 4 (28 points)\nCactusus experimentalis.\nYou would like to create a genomic library of Cactusus experimentalis\ngenomic library.\n1.\n2.\nAntibiotic resistance gene\n3.\nRestriction enzyme cut site\nEnzymes\nDNA Polymerase\nRNA Polymerase\nddATP, ddCTP, ddGTP, ddTTP\nE.

Given the result in part f, would you want to use genomic or cDNA library for this\nexperiment? Why?\nWe would want to use cDNA library because the fragments in that library would correspond to\nfinal mRNA product, i.e. there will be no introns. If introns are present, bacteria could not edit\nthem out of the mRNA, and so it would not be able to produce functional protein.\nii. What organism must the promoter be from? Why?\nThe promoter would have to come from E. coli. Promoters are not universal, and E. coli\ntranscription machinery would only recognize E. coli promoters."

The free energy of this reaction is not changed\nby the presence of the enzyme, BUT the enzyme can speed up the reaction by lower the Ea.\nEnzyme Mechanisms\nIn a reaction like that above, Ea could represent an energetically unfavorable transitional\nstate that the substrate must obtain before forming product. Enzymes can lower the Ea by\nstabilizing the substrate in that transitional state and thus speed up the reaction.\nFor a reaction involving two substrates:\nA + B ---> C,\nthe enzyme may increase the local concentration of A and B and drive the reaction\nforward.\n\nKinetics of enzyme reactions\nOne way to study an enzyme is to measure the formation of the product. If you were to\nperform an experiment under defined conditions at a given concentration of substrate and\nenzyme you could plot a time course of the enzyme catalyzed reaction.\nExample:\nInitial\nvelocity\nreaction\nEquilibrium\nconcentration\nof product\none reaction run with\na particular [S], [Enz],\npH, etc.\n0.0\n0.0\ntime elapsed\nEnzymes catalyze both forward and reverse reactions. In the reaction S -->P, the enzyme\nconverts substrate (S) to product (P). Initially, the concentration of P is small and the net\nreaction is S -->P. As [P] increases, the rate of the reaction S -->P decreases until the rate of\nthe forward reaction equals the rate of the reverse reaction. At this point the reaction is in\nequilibrium.\nTo measure the kinetic properties of a given enzyme, you must perform many\nexperiments like the one above, holding the enzyme concentration constant and varying\nthe substrate concentrations. The initial reaction velocity at each substrate concentration is\nmeasured, and the data from all the experiments is used to plot the initial reaction\nvelocity, Vo, as a function of substrate concentration [S]. An example is found below.\n\nV\ninitial\nreaction\nvelocity\nmaximum\nreaction\nvelocity\nV max\no\n[S]\ninf\ninitial substrate concentration\n\nA few things about the V vs. [S] graph:\nVelocity is dependent on [S], but remember this graph was generated at one enzyme\nconcentration. If more enzyme was added, the reaction velocity would increase.\nThe velocity asymptotically approaches a maximum as [S] --> inf.\nWhy isn't the graph linear?\nAs [S] gets large, the enzyme becomes saturated. Every enzyme molecule is complexed\nwith substrate and since the amount of enzyme used in this series of experiments is fixed,\nthe rate asymptotically approaches a maximum.\nNOTE: the two preceding graphs look very similar, but represent different things. It is\nimportant to understand the difference between an individual reaction: [P] vs. t (from\nwhich you get Vo) and a kinetic graph of many such reactions: Vo vs. [S].\nEnzymes that display this kinetic behavior can be modeled mathematically as was first\nshown by Michaelis and Menten in 1913:\nMichaelis-Menten Enzyme Kinetics\nFor an enzymatic reaction:\nk1\nk3\nE + S\nES\nE + P\nk 2\nThe symbols represent (in our example):\nE\nenzyme\nS\nsubstrate\nES\nenzyme-substrate complex\nP\nproduct\nk1\nthe rate at which E combines with S to form ES\nk2\nthe rate at which ES can dissociate into E and S\nk3\nthe rate at which ES can proceed to form E and P\nMichaelis and Menten modeled the catalytic rate of enzymes under steady-state conditions\nwhere the concentration of ES remains unchanged over time while the concentrations of\nstarting materials and products are changing. At steady state the rate of ES formation\nequals the rate of ES breakdown. The following conditions are assumed in this model.\n1) The uncatalyzed rate of S ---> P is negligible (the reaction does not go without enzyme).\n2) Because the [S] is far greater than the [E], the amount of substrate bound by enzyme is\nnegligible compare to the total [S]. Also assumed is that [S] does not vary with time (this\nreaction is under examination for a brief moment), and the reaction rate remains the\nsame.\n3) The reverse reaction (P ---> S) does not occur.\n\nGiven the above assumptions and approximations, the dependence of Vo on [S] can be\nderived mathematically.

      "content": "7.014 Handout\nBiochemical Genetics\nMIT Department of Biology\n7.014 Introductory Biology, Spring 2005\n\nBiochemical Genetics\nIntroduction and Background\nWe have learned that proteins can act as enzymes and catalyze all sorts of reactions in the cell.\nWe discussed a biochemical approach to understanding cellular processes by purifying\nenzymes, determining their structure, and then studying the reactions they catalyze. Often\nthough this type of study does not answer the question, \"what does this protein do within the\norganism?\" One approach to this question would be to remove the protein being studied and\ndetermine how this affects the organism. But, is this possible?\nThe information required to make an enzyme is encoded as a gene in the DNA of the\norganism. In general, one gene corresponds to one polypeptide (a gene can also correspond to\nan RNA, but this is not relevant to the discussion at hand). This correspondence and advances\nin DNA technology allow researchers to create an organism that lacks a particular protein by\nremoving the DNA that encodes that protein. In effect, a specific mutant organism can be\ncreated and by studying this mutant we can study the effects of removing a single protein.\nEven before this was a possibility, genetics played a key role in understanding many basic\ncellular processes. If you wanted to study olfaction but you had not identified any of the\nproteins involved, how could you begin? Because one gene corresponds to one protein and\nthe genotype of an organism is often reflected in its phenotype, you could start by finding\nmutants that can not detect odors. The assumption would be that each mutant carries a\nchange in the DNA that encodes a particular protein important in olfaction. The altered\nprotein could have an altered function or be so changed that it no longer functions at all. The\nchange in the DNA sequence is called a mutation, and the cell or organism carrying a mutation\nis called a mutant.\nMutants with a disruption in the olfaction process would all have the same phenotype, an\ninability to sense odors. This is true even if each mutant had an alteration in a different gene.\nFor example, assume that the ability to perceive odors requires three different proteins and\nprotein 1 is encoded by gene1, protein 2 is encoded by gene 2, etc. The phenotype of an\norganism with a mutation in gene 1 would be the same as the phenotype of an organism with\na mutation in a gene 2; neither of these mutants would be able to perceive an odor.\nThus even without any knowledge of the genes or the proteins involved in a particular cellular\nprocess, we can begin to study it by collecting mutants that all display the same phenotype.\nA Model System\nFor this introductory illustration of biochemical genetics we will begin with a model system.\nModel systems are organisms that can be easily manipulated in a laboratory environment.\nWidely used as model organisms are single-celled eukaryotes of the yeast family. These\nyeasts, like Saccharomyces cerevisiae or Schizosaccharomyces pombe are associated with the making\nof beer and bread. These cells are easily and quickly grown in a laboratory, can live in either a\nhaploid or a diploid state, and can reproduce sexually or asexually. Yeast cells can be treated\nwith chemicals or irradiated to increase the mutation rate, and they can be rather easily\nconvinced to accept exogenous DNA. To explore more about yeast see:\nhttp://enpc1644.eas.asu.edu/modsum/YstSUM.htm.\n\nThe yeast life cycle.\nYeast cells reproduce asexually simply through mitosis where the mother cell divides to\nproduce two identical daughter cells. If the yeast cell is diploid, it can instead enter a meiotic\npathway and produce four haploid cells or \"spores\". Interestingly, each of these haploid\nspores can enter a mitotic cycle and indefinitely produce identical haploid daughter cells. Two\nhaploid yeast cells can fuse or \"mate\" to create a new diploid cell.\nGrowing yeast cells.\nYeast cells can be grown easily in the laboratory. Wild-type yeast cells are prototrophs. This\nmeans that they can synthesize all the necessary cellular components de novo if provided with\nsome basic carbohydrates and salts. The basic required carbohydrates and salts are supplied\nas minimal medium. Yeast cells can be grown in test tubes containing liquid minimal medium or\non petri plates containing a solid form of minimal medium. A single yeast cell can only be\nseen with a microscope, but a single cell can divide into 108 identical cells in 48 hours. 108 cells\nare enough to turn a tube of liquid medium cloudy, and if the tube of medium is allowed to\nsettle, a coating of cells is visible at the bottom of the tube. When a single cell divides on solid\nmedium, all the daughter cells stay grouped together. 108 cells grouped together form a colony\nabout as big as the following dot.\n-\nYeast cells can also be grown in or on rich medium. Rich medium contains carbohydrates and\nsalts and all the amino acids and other nutrients that yeast cells could need. When presented\nwith amino acid supplements (or other nutrients), yeast cells do not invest cellular energy to\nmake them de novo, but instead scavenge them from the medium.\nWhen a mutation occurs in the genome of a yeast cell that eliminates a protein required for\nbiosynthesis, the mutant yeast cell can no longer grow on mininal medium. Such mutants are\ncalled auxotrophs. If the mutation damaged a gene encoding an enzyme needed for arginine\nsynthesis, then the mutant cell would not grow on minimal medium but would grow on\nminimal media that was supplemented with arginine. Alternatively, if the mutation damaged\na gene encoding an enzyme needed for nicotinic acid synthesis, then the mutant cell would not\ngrow on minimal medium but would grow on minimal medium that was supplemented with\nnicotinic acid. Both the arginine auxotroph and the nicotonic acid auxotroph could grow on\nrich medium.\nMaking and Identifying Mutants\nMutations like those discussed above are naturally occurring due errors in mitosis or meiosis.\nHowever, to study a biochemical pathway using genetics, many mutants are needed. To this\nend, wild-type yeast cells can be mutangenized by irradiation or with chemicals that damage\nDNA. In a mutagenesis, the starting cells are usually haploid, and are treated with levels of\nmutagen such that most cells carry a single mutation. Why would you want to begin with a\nhaploid strain?\nYou are hoping to identify cells that are missing a gene encoding a protein important in the\npathway that you are studying. In a haploid cell, a mutation in a gene that results in a non-\nfunctioning protein is likely to have an effect. If you began with diploid cells, both copies of a\ngene would need to be mutated to prevent protein function. In a diploid, a single mutation\ncould be masked by the normal copy of the gene because the phenotype of the diploid would\nbe wild-type.\nDepending upon the process being studied, creativity and insight is needed to accurately\npredict what phenotype your mutants should have and identify interesting mutants in a large\npopulation. Take the olfaction example for instance. You might begin such a study using fruit\n\nflies; and then search for mutants that are unable to negotiate a maze to find the target fruit.\nYou may well collect flies that can not sense odors, but among them are flies that can sense\nodor perfectly but are poor fliers.\nLet's outline a \"mutant hunt\" with a straight-forward example. Say we want to study arginine\nbiosynthesis in a yeast model system. We begin with a haploid, wild-type strain. This strain\ncan grow on minimal medium. We mutangenize many of these cells in liquid and then\ntransfer (or plate) the treated cells onto solid agar medium+ in petri plates. What type of media\nwould you use for these solid agar plates?\nFor reasons that will become clear, we plate our mutagenized cells on rich medium and many\ncolonies are seen two days later. How do we know which of the many colonies contain cells\nthat are defective in arginine biosynthesis? Remember that the mutants of interest to us carry\ndefects in arginine biosynthesis and can not grow unless the medium contains arginine. So we\nsimply need to determine which of the colonies growing on rich medium have cells that can\nnot grow in the absence or arginine. Hum...?\nReplica Plating, Screening and Selecting\nIn a real experiment, you may have 10,000 or more colonies to test, so the concept may be\nsimple, but the execution would be tedious and time consuming. A technique called replica\nplating developed by Esther and Joshua Lederberg, makes it possible to quickly screen many\ncolonies for mutants of interest. The basic principle is the same as that of the rubber stamp.\nRegardless of the deficiency, most cells form colonies on the rich medium plates, these plates\nare called non-selective. We just need to copy those colonies onto plates that can distinguish cells\nwith mutations in the arginine synthesis pathway from others. The non-selective, rich\nmedium plate serves as a master plate. A sterile transfer device*, such as a piece of velvet is\ngently pressed onto the master plate. The loops and threads of the material pick up a small\nnumber of cells from each colony on the master plate. All the colonies and their spatial\nrelationship to each other are now represented on the velvet. The velvet is then applied to\nconsecutive replica plates. Some of these replica plates are selective and mutants of interest fail\nto grow. In our case, selective plates lack arginine.\nvelvet covered surface\nmaster plate\nreplica plate\nstore\nincubate\n*The prototype of the transfer device was the application pad that came in Esther Lederberg's powder compact.\n\nIn such a screen, we can identify mutants that have lost the ability to grow with out arginine.\nThese cells will not form a colony on the replica plate but can be retrieved from the master\nplate by comparing the position of the colonies on the two plates.\nWe could follow the same experimental outline if our mutant hunt was designed to identify\nmutants that had acquired a new ability, say resistance to anti-fungal drugs. In this case the\nnon-selective medium would not contain drug, but the selective medium would. On the drug\ncontaining replica plate we could select only for cells that had gained the ability to grow in the\npresence of drug.\nThese procedures would be repeated until a large collection of mutants had been identified.\nRemember that all our mutants will have the same phenotype, in our example they require\narginine, even if each mutant has an alteration in a different gene. Each mutant was\nindividually isolated, and we will randomly call them the arg1 mutant, the arg2 mutant, the\narg3 mutant, etc. Until we know more, we will assume that the arg1 mutant has a mutation in\nthe arg1 gene and is defective in the ARG1 protein, and that the arg2 mutant has a mutation in\nthe arg2 gene and is defective in the ARG2 protein\nAnalyzing the Collection of Mutants\nYou now have a collection of haploid mutants that each carry only one mutation. You might\nbegin by asking the following questions:\n1. Is the phenotype of each mutant dominant or recessive?\n2. Which of the mutants have mutations in the same gene?\n3. Which of the mutants have mutations in different genes?\n4. How many different genes are mutated in this population of mutants?\n5. Do these genes encode proteins that function in a particular order, and if so, in what\norder do the proteins function?\nEach of these questions can be answered using one of three tests, a test of recessivity, a test of\ncomplementation, or a test of epistasis.\nTest of Recessivity\nThe first step is to determine if the phenotype of each mutant is recessive. This information is\nvital in interpreting the other tests. Recall that a recessive phenotype is a phenotype that is not\nseen in a heterozygote. In our case, a heterozygote would be a diploid yeast cell made from a\nhaploid mutant and a haploid wild-type (wt or +) cell. This diploid cell would carry a single\nmutation. If the phenotype of the mutant is recessive, then this diploid cell will appear wild-\ntype. If the phenotype of the mutant is dominant, then this diploid cell would be the same as\nthe mutant. In general, recessive phenotypes correspond to loss-of-function mutations.\nFor example, we could take our haploid arg1 mutant, mate it with a wild-type haploid cell,\nand prevent the resulting diploid cell from undergoing a meiotic division. The arg1/+ diploid\ncell will then multiply by mitotic cell divisions. If the phenotype of the arg1 mutant is\nrecessive, the arg1/+ diploid cells will grow on minimal medium, without arginine\nsupplementation. At a molecular level, the haploid arg1 mutant had defective ARG1 protein\nand was thus missing an enzyme needed to synthesize arginine. Arginine is an amino acid\nand without it the cell can not produce the proteins need for cellular functions. The arg1/+\ndiploid has one good arg1 gene, can make sufficient amounts of normal ARG1 protein, and can\nthus synthesize the arginine needed to make cellular protein.\n\nComplementation Test\nA single test called a complementation test can answer the next three questions.\n- Which of the mutants have mutations in the same gene?\n- Which of the mutants have mutations in different genes?\n- How many different genes are mutated in this population of mutants?\nA complementation test is much the same as the test for recessivity, but a complementation\ntest involves making a diploid using different combinations of the haploid mutants.\nIf the diploid looks like the wild-type organism, the two mutations are said to complement.\nThe underlying basis is the same as described above for our example. The haploid arg1\nmutant has a mutation in the arg1 gene, makes defective ARG1 protein, and thus is missing an\nenzyme needed to synthesize arginine. Likewise, the arg2 mutant has a mutation in the arg2\ngene and this mutation prevents the resulting ARG2 protein from functioning. Without ARG2\nprotein, the arg2 mutant, like the arg1 mutant can not grow on minimal medium.\nA diploid cell made from the arg1 mutant and the arg2 mutant would have one good copy of\nthe arg1 gene (donated by the arg2 mutant), and one good copy of the arg2 gene (donated by\nthe arg1 mutant). This diploid would be able to produce functional ARG1 and ARG2 proteins,\nand because this diploid cell can make all the proteins required for arginine synthesis, it can\ngrow on minimal medium.\nRemember that, without information, we randomly assigned names to these mutants. What if\nby chance, both the arg1 mutant and the arg2 mutant had mutations in the same gene? The\nresulting diploid cell would not have a functional ARG1 protein, and would not grow on\nminimal medium. In this case, the arg1 mutant and the arg2 mutant fail to complement.\nData from a complementation test might look like this where the intersection of a column and\na row shows the phenotype of the resulting diploid.\nMutant\narg1\narg2\narg3\narg4\narg5\nwildtype\narg1\nfails\nfails\ncomplements\nfails\ncomplements\ncomplements\narg2\nfails\ncomplements\nfails\ncomplements\ncomplements\narg3\nfails\ncomplements\nfails\ncomplements\narg4\nfails\ncomplements\ncomplements\narg5\nfails\ncomplements\nwildtype\ncomplements\nThese data suggest that the five mutants have identified two genes. The arg1, arg2, and arg4\nmutants each have a mutation in the same gene. The arg3 and arg5 mutants each have a\nmutation in the same gene, but a different gene than the one damaged in the arg1, arg2, and\narg4 mutants.\nEpistasis Test\nOnce you know how many different genes are represented by your mutants, you can perform\nan epistasis test. An epistasis test can determine if these genes encode proteins that function in\na particular pathway, and determine the order in which these proteins act.\nGiven:\nenzyme 1\nenzyme 2\nenzyme 3\nα------------> β ------------> γ ------------> final product\n\nYou could assume that an organism lacking only enzyme 1 would not form β and could not\ntherefore make the final product. However, if this organism had an exogenous supply of β,\nenzyme 2 could convert β into γ and enzyme 3 could convert γ into the final product.\nAlternatively, an organism lacking both enzyme 1 and enzyme 2 would not form β, and even if\nthis organism had an exogenous supply of β it could not make γ. Indeed, the organism lacking\nboth enzyme 1 and enzyme 2 would need an exogenous supply of γ to complete the pathway\nand make the final product.\nGiven the pathway above, you might also find that an organism lacking enzyme 1 would\naccumulate α, where an organism lacking enzyme 2 would accumulate β. What would you\npredict for an organism lacking both enzyme 1 and enzyme 2? You would expect α to\naccumulate.\nIn effect, epistasis tests use just this sort of logic and a collection of mutants to define and order\nbiochemical pathways. Let's look at our example of arginine synthesis in a yeast model\nsystem. Assume that the mutants unable to synthesize arginine were and categorized into\nfour complementation groups. We assume that each of these groups represents a different\ngene, and therefore at least four different enzymes are required for the arginine synthesis\npathway.\nTo continue, we need to begin to distinguish between the different mutants. Often\nintermediates in a biosynthetic pathway are known and mutants can be differentiated by\nexamining their growth on media supplemented with various intermediate compounds. Each\nmutant will grow on a defined set of media that is different from the media that supports\ngrowth of a different mutant. In our example, N-acetylornithine, ornithine, citrulline, and\narginosuccinate are intermediates in the arginine pathway.\nOur mutants were each tested for the ability to grow and on the various media shown below.\nCompounds added as supplement\nMutant\nGene\nN-acetylornithine\nornithine\ncitrulline\narginosuccinate\narginine\naffected\nMutant 1\narg1\nNo growth\ngrows\ngrows\ngrows\ngrows\nMutant 2\narg2\nNo growth\nNo growth\ngrows\ngrows\ngrows\nMutant 3\narg3\nNo growth\nNo growth\nNo growth\ngrows\ngrows\nMutant 4\narg4\nNo growth\nNo growth\nNo growth\ngrows\ngrows\nwildtype\nnone\ngrows\ngrows\ngrows\ngrows\ngrows\nThe growth characteristics of Mutant 1 predict that the arg1 gene encodes an enzyme, ARG1,\nnecessary to convert N-acetylornithine into one of the other intermediates and this enzyme\nfunctions early in the pathway. The growth characteristics of Mutant 2 allow us to say that the\narg2 gene encodes an enzyme necessary to convert ornithine into one of the other\nintermediates and this enzyme functions next in the pathway. Working through the data in\nthe chart allows us to propose the following pathway for arginine synthesis.\nARG1\nARG2\nARG3\nARG4\nN-acetylornithine ---------> ornithine ---------> citrulline ---------> arginosuccinate ---------> arginine\nWe would further test this proposed pathway by creating haploid organisms that carry two\ndeficiencies (double mutants) and determining the phenotype of these double mutants. If we\nproduced a haploid mutant lacking both the arg1 and the arg2 genes, we would predict that\nthis double mutant would have the same growth pattern as seen above with Mutant 2.\n\nThe double mutant should only grow on minimal media supplemented with citrulline,\narginosuccinate, or arginine. These data would place the function the protein encoded by arg1\nbefore the function of the protein encoded by arg2.\nAlternatively, we could study the pathway by determining what intermediate accumulates in\nthe mutant cells. Mutant 1, which lacks only arg1 would accumulate N-acetylornithine. The\ndouble mutant lacking both the arg1 and the arg2 genes would also accumulate N\nacetylornithine. This data would also place the function the protein encoded by arg1 before the\nfunction of the protein encoded by arg2.\nMutations in genes encoding essential proteins\nSo far we have discussed mutants that could grow, given the right circumstances. What,\nhowever, would happen if the gene that was mutated encoded DNA polymerase? Without\nDNA polymerase, cells could not replicate their DNA, they could therefore not undergo\nmitosis and form new daughter cells. This mutation interrupts an essential function, and\nregardless of the type of medium, these mutants could not grow. How then can we use\ngenetics to study an essential process?\nThe mutations discussed so far have been mutations in a gene that resulted in a lack of the\nencoded protein or a non-functioning protein. There is a different class of mutations where\nthe change in the DNA still allows production of a functioning protein, but only under certain\nconditions. Mutants with this type of mutation are called conditional mutants, and one kind of\nconditional mutant is a temperature-sensitive (ts) mutant. Temperature-sensitive mutants carry\na mutation in a gene that produces a temperature-sensitive protein. At the permissive\ntemperature (low temperature) when the mutant protein is translated, the mutation results in\nonly a minor change in the protein so it folds into the appropriate three-dimensional shape,\nand is stable and functional. The mutant appears normal at permissive temperature.\nAt the non-permissive temperature (high temperature), the increased thermal energy reveals\nthe change in the protein caused by the mutation. The mutant protein unfolds, becomes\nunstable and no longer functions normally. If the protein affected is essential, at non-\npermissive temperatures the mutant fails to grow. Thus, although the mutation is always\npresent, the mutants appear wild-type at the permissive temperature and mutant at the non-\npermissive temperature. The existence of this type of mutant has allowed genetic analysis of\nessential cellular processes such as protein secretion and the regulation of cell division.\nConclusion\nWe have outlined a genetic approach in a yeast model system to studying many diverse\ncellular processes, even without prior knowledge of the genes or the proteins involved. As\nresearchers, we might study yeast cells for their applications in the brewing and baking\nindustries, or we might study yeast because some species are important human and crop\npathogens. More likely, we study yeast to understanding cellular processes that are important\nin all cells, from yeast to man. A good example of the relevance of a yeast genetic study is how\nidentification key molecules in the control of cell division in yeast have lead to important\ndiscoveries in the field of human cancer biology. So the next time you read an editorial\ndemanding that taxpayer money is not spent on research of newt taste buds (just as an\nexample), wait before you take up the cause. Take a broader view of the possible benefits and\nramifications that such a study may have."

      "content": "7.014 Lectures 16 &17: The Biosphere & Carbon and Energy Metabolism\nSimplified Summary of Microbial Metabolism\nThe metabolism of different types of organisms drives the biogeochemical cycles of the biosphere. Balanced oxidation and\nreduction reactions keep the system from \"running down\".\nAll living organisms can be ordered into two groups1, autotrophs and heterotrophs, according to what they use as their\ncarbon source. Within these groups the metabolism of organisms can be further classified according to their source of\nenergy and electrons.\nAutotrophs: Those organisms get their energy from light (photoautotrophs) or reduced inorganic compounds\n(chemoautotrophs), and their carbon from CO2 through one of the following processes:\nPhotosynthesis (aerobic) -- Light energy used to reduce CO2 to organic carbon using H2O as a source of electrons.\nO2 evolved from splitting H2O. (Plants, algae, cyanobacteria)\nBacterial Photosynthesis (anaerobic) -- Light energy used to reduce CO2 to organic carbon (same as photosynthesis).\nH2S is used as the electron donor instead of H2O. (e.g. purple sulfur bacteria)\nChemosynthesis (aerobic) -- Energy from the oxidation of inorganic molecules is used to reduce CO2 to organic\ncarbon (bacteria only).\ne.g. sulfur oxidizing bacteria\nH2S → S → SO4-2\n-\nnitrifying bacteria NH4+ → NO2 → NO3-\niron oxidizing bacteria Fe+2 → Fe+3\nmethane oxidizing bacteria (methanotrophs) CH4 → CO2\nHeterotrophs: These organisms get their energy and carbon from organic compounds (supplied by autotrophs through the\nfood web) through one or more of the following processes:\nAerobic Respiration (aerobic) ⎯ Oxidation of organic compounds to CO2 and H2O, yielding energy for biological work.\nO2 is the final electron acceptor (All aerobic organisms -- eukaryotes and prokaryotes).\nFermentation (anaerobic) -- Glucose converted to pyruvate (yielding energy) which is then converted to a variety of end\nproducts (e.g. yeast oxidize glucose to ethanol, and anaerobic muscle oxidizes it to lactic acid). Glucose is not\noxidized all the way to CO2 as it is in aerobic respiration (eukaryotes and prokaryotes).\nAnaerobic Respiration (anaerobic) ⎯ Oxidation of organic compounds to CO2 yielding energy for biological work. Final\nelectron acceptor is not O2, but rather NO3-, SO4\n-2 etc. (prokaryotes only)\ndenitrifying bacteria NO3- → NO (g) → N2O (g) → N2 (g)\nsulfate reducing bacteria SO4\n-2 → H2S\nmethanogens CO2 → CH4\nThus all life is run on the free energy difference between O2 and organic carbon (glucose). The autotrophs synthesize\nglucose using solar or chemical energy, which is broken down through respiration (either their own or that of the organisms\nthat eat them) to provide the energy necessary for \"biological work\". Redox reactions are central to all of these energy\ntransformations, and the resulting flows of electrons manifest themselves in the form of biogeochemical cycles. The\nactivities of bacteria keep these cycles moving. For example, the chemosynthetic bacteria oxidize many essential elements\nin the process of getting the energy required to reduce CO2. Certain anaerobic bacteria in turn reduce these compounds in\nthe process of anaerobic respiration ⎯ i.e., they use them as an electron acceptor in the absence of oxygen. This keeps\nthe element cycles flowing and keeps the system from \"running down\".\n1 This summary is over-simplified. There are microbes that don't fit into this scheme. Some organisms are \"mixotrophs\" ⎯ i.e., they\ncan switch between different modes of metabolism depending on the circumstances. Also, there are associations between organisms\n⎯ i.e., \"symbioses\" which behave as a single organism with multiple modes of metabolism. Finally, there are microorganisms that\nhave managed to break out of this general framework. Basically, if it can work thermodynamically, Nature has created a microbe that\ncan do it.\nMIT Department of Biology\n7.014 Introductory Biology, Spring 2005\n\nGENERAL CLASSIFICATION OF MICROORGANISMS\nCarbon Source\nEnergy Source\nElectron Donor\nInorganic (CO2)\nOrganic\nLight\nChemical\nInorganic\nOrganic\nGeneral classification\nAutotroph\nHeterotroph\nPhototroph Chemotroph\nLithotroph Organotroph\nOrganisms\nPhytoplankton\nX\nX\nH2O\nGreen and purple\nX\nX\nH2S\nsulfur bacteria\nFungi & protozoa\nX\nX\nX\nMost bacteria\nX\nX\nX\n(heterotrophic)\nNitrifying bacteria\nX\nNH4\nNH4\nSulfur oxidizing\nX\nH2S\nH2S\nbacteria\nAutotroph\n(Quantities of compounds omitted for simplicity)\n\"Dark reactions\"\nNADPH+\nNADP+\n(common to all)\nCO2\nglucose\nATP\nADP + Pi\nPhotosynthesis\n\nLight\n-\ne\n\nD\nNADP+\nC\nNADPH\nH+\nADP + Pi ⎯→ ATP\nType\nA\nB\noxygenic (plant)\nH2O\n⇒\nO2\nanyoxygenic\nH2S\n⇒\nS, SO4\n2-\n\nAutotrophs, continued\n(Quantities of compounds omitted for simplicity)\n\"Dark reactions\"\nNADPH+\nNADP+\n(common to all)\nCO2\nglucose\nATP\nADP + Pi\nChemosynthesis\n(releases energy)\n-\ne\n\nD\nE\nC\nF\nH+ gradient\ni\nATP\nD\nNADP+\nC\ne-\nADP + P\n\n(requires energy)\nNADPH\n(requires energy)\nType\nC\nD\nE\nF\nsulfur-oxidizing\nH2S\n⇒\nS, SO4\n2-\nO2\n⇒\nH2O\nH2S\n⇒\nS, SO4\n2-\nNO3\n-\n⇒\nN2O\nnitrifying\nNH3\n⇒\nNO3\n-\nO2\n⇒\nH2O\nNO2\n\nHeterotrophs\nlactate\nor\nCO2 + ethanol\nFermentation 2 NAD+\n2 NADH\nglucose\n2 pyruvate\n2 ADP + 2 Pi\n2 ATP\nRespiration\n(Quantities of compounds omitted for simplicity)\nglucose\nNAD+\n\nATP\nNADH\npyruvate\nKrebs'\ncycle\nNAD+\nNADH\n\nCO2\n\nNAD+\n-\ne\nA\nNADH\nB\nH+ gradient\nADP + Pi ⎯→ ATP\nType\naerobic\nsulfate-\nreducing\ndenitrifying\nA\nB\nO2\n⇒\nH2O\nSO4\n2-\n⇒\nH2S or S\nNO3\n-\n⇒\nNO, N2,\nN2O, NH3"

For further reading, consult an\nintroductory chemistry or microbiology textbook.\nRedox reactions involve the transfer of electrons (usually abbreviated e-) from one molecule to the other.\nReduction is when a molecule gains electrons.\nOxidation is when a molecule loses electrons.\n(One way to remember this is the mnemonic \"LEO says GER,\" which translates to \"Loss of Electrons is\nOxidation; Gain of Electrons is Reduction.\")\nSince electrons cannot exist free in solution, an oxidation must always be paired with a reduction; hence\nthe term redox (reduction and oxidation) reaction.\nThe terminology can be very confusing:\noxidation\nloss of e-\nreduction\ngain of e-\noxidizing agent\ngains e- during reaction and is therefore reduced during reaction\nreducing agent\nloses e- during reaction and is therefore oxidized during reaction\noxidized form\nform of molecule lacking (it's all relative) an e-\nreduced form\nform of the molecule having an additional (again, relative) e-\nThere are three ways to represent a redox reaction; these are shown below with a representative\nbiological redox reaction:\n(1) Overall reaction:\nacetaldehyde + NADH + H+ ⎯→ ethanol + NAD+\n(2) Electron-transfer diagram:\nacetaldehyde\n-\nNAD+\ne\nethanol\nNADH + H+\n(3) Half-reactions\nAcetaldehyde + 2 H+ + 2e-\n→\nEthanol\n+\nNADH\n→\nNAD+ + H+ + 2e-\nAcetaldehyde + NADH + H+\n→\nEthanol + NAD+\nIn the reaction shown above:\nNADH is oxidized to NAD+\n\nacetaldehyde is reduced to ethanol\nacetaldehyde is the oxidizing agent\nNADH is the reducing agent\nNADH and ethanol are the reduced forms\n\nNAD+ and acetaldehyde are the oxidized forms\n1/6\nMIT Department of Biology\n7.014 Introductory Biology, Spring 2005\n\nThere are two main ways that redox chemistry is discussed this class:\n1) Given a redox reaction and the direction it proceeds, what is the e- flow (that is, which\nmolecule is oxidized and which is reduced)?\nIn order to solve this kind of problem, you will need to know how to tell which of the two forms of a given\nmolecule is the reduced form and which is the oxidized form. The easiest way is to:\nLOOK IT UP. Use a table of standard oxidation or reduction potentials, like the one on page 6 of this\nhandout. These show the two forms of many common molecules and the redox relationship between\nthem.\nFor example, take the following reaction from the citric acid cycle:\nsuccinate + FAD → fumarate + FADH2\nLooking at the chart on page 6 of this handout, you'll find two half reactions relating the compounds in this\nreaction:\n(1) fumarate + 2H+ + 2e- → succinate\nand\n(2) FAD + 2H+ + 2e- →FADH2\n(Don't worry about the E° values just yet.)\nThese two half reactions add up to the overall reaction if you reverse reaction (1):\nsuccinate\n→\nfumarate + 2H+ + 2e-\n+\nFAD + 2H+ +2e-\n→\nFADH2\nsuccinate + FAD\n→\nfumarate + FADH2\nTherefore: succinate is oxidized to fumarate\nFAD is reduced to FADH2\nFAD is the oxidizing agent\nsuccinate is the reducing agent\nsuccinate and FADH2 are the reduced forms\nfumarate and FAD are the oxidized forms\nOr, to use an electron-transfer diagram:\nFAD\n-\nfumarate\ne\nFADH2\nsuccinate\n2/6\n\n2) Given a redox reaction, in which direction will it proceed spontaneously?\nIn General:\n-\n-\nNH4\n+\nO2\n\nNO2\n-\nH2O\nNH4\n+\n-\n-\n- from NH4\n+ to O2 (\"up the chart\"), energy will be\n(∆\n-\n-; this will also release\nenergy:\nNH4\n+\nO2\nH2O\n-\nH2O\nO2\nNO3\n-\n- from H2O to NO2\n-\n∆\nH2O\n-\nO2\nNO3\n-\ne-\ne-\ne-\ne-\nDifferent molecules have different tendencies to lose e , which reflects the degree to which they are\nreduced. Their tendency to lose e is reflected by their position in the chart on page 5; more reduced\nmolecules are at the lower right of the chart. The more reduced a molecule is, the more potential energy it\ncontains to be released for biological work.\nFor example:\nis reduced; it has a tendency to release e (it is lower in the chart). O is very oxidized; it has a\nstrong tendency to accept e . Therefore, if you transfer e\nreleased\nG<0). This process can continue as e are transferred to O from NO\nNO\nOn the other hand, the reverse reaction (transfer e\n; \"down the chart\") requires energy\ninput to run in the direction shown ( G>0):\nNO\nrequires\nenergy\ninput\nreleases\nenergy\nreleases\nenergy\nreleases\nenergy\nThis can be put in mathematical terms using the E° values on the chart. This is analogous to figuring out\n∆G for a reaction to determine which direction will proceed spontaneously. In the case of redox reactions,\nthe energy of the reaction is measured in volts; each reaction has a standard potential (voltage) E°. ∆G°\nand E° are related by the Nernst equation:\n∆G 0 = -nF(∆E 0)\n\nWhere:\nn = number of electrons transferred per reaction\nkcal ⎞\nF = the Faraday constant ⎝⎛23 Volt·mol⎠\n∆E 0 = E 0(reducing agent) - E 0(oxidizing agent)\n3/6\n\nNote: to determine the direction of a redox reaction, you do not need to use the Nernst equation. You\nonly need to know the sign of ∆ E 0.\n∆ E 0< 0\nreaction spontaneous ←⎯⎯\n∆ E 0> 0\nreaction spontaneous ⎯→\n(note that this is the reverse of ∆ G)\nThis is shown for the previous reaction:\nIn order to arrive at the desired overall reaction:\n-\nyou must reverse the sign of E 0 for a reaction if you reverse the direction of the reaction. Here\nreaction (2) must be reversed.\n-\nEven though we multiplied the reactions by a constant (6 × reaction 1; 12 × reaction 2)\nto balance the reaction, we did not multiply E 0 even if you multiply the reaction by constant (this is not\nthe same as ∆ G).\nThis is shown below:\n6CO2 + 24H+ + 24e-\n→\nglucose + 6H2O\nE 0 = -0.43V\n+\n12H2S\n→\n12S + 24H+ + 24e-\nE 0 = +0.243V\n\n6CO2 + 12H2S\n→\nglucose (C6H12O6) + 6H2O + 12S\n∆ E 0 = -0.187V\nSince ∆ E 0< 0, the reaction is spontaneous to the left (→ ). This means that it requires energy input to go\nto the right-- therefore, energy input is required get net glucose synthesis. Since this is a photosynthetic\nreaction, and a substantial amount of light energy is available, this is no problem.\nNote that, since we did not need to balance the reaction to calculate ∆E °, we could have simplified the\ncalculation as follows:\n6CO2 + e- →\nglucose\nE 0 = -0.43V\n+\nH2S →\nS + e-\nE 0 = +0.243V\n\nCO2 + H2S →\nglucose + S\n∆ E 0 = -0.187V\nIn all cases, you do not have to balance the reaction to find ∆ E °.\n∆ G 0 can be calculated in the following way:\n(Note: you will not need to do, it is only included FYI)\nThis is where balancing the reaction comes in--you have to balance the reaction to get n, the number of\ne- transferred. In the case of the above reaction n = 24.\n∆ G 0 = -nF(∆ E 0)\n∆ G 0 = -24⎝⎛ 23\nkcal ⎞ (-0.187V)\nVolt·mol⎠\n∆ G 0 = +103 kcals/mol\nThis is a highly endothermic reaction--therefore a substantial input of energy is required to get net\nproduction of glucose. Since this is a photosynthetic reaction, and a substantial amount of light energy is\navailable, this is no problem.\n4/6\n\nFinal Note:\nThis overview of oxidation-reduction reactions has been grossly oversimplified to provide the level of\nunderstanding necessary to cover the basics of photosynthesis and respiration.\nIn reality, you will find that all redox reactions are affected by pH and the concentrations of products and\nreactants. Furthermore, some products or reactants can be further stabilized by other chemical reactions\n(e.g. Fe3+ can precipitate as Fe(OH)3) which will also alter the equilibrium.\nBecause of these various circumstances, you may come across situations that do not seem to make\nsense on the basis of standard redox potentials alone.

Primary producers\n(autotrophs) do this through photosynthesis; Secondary producers (heterotrophs) do it through\nthe assimilation of the organic carbon in their food. Remember that all organic carbon in the food\nweb is ultimately derived from primary production.\nDEFINITIONS\nPrimary Productivity: Rate of conversion of CO2 to organic carbon (photosynthesis) per unit\nsurface area of the earth, expressed either in terns of weight of carbon, or the equivalent calories\n-1\ne.g.,\ng C m-2 year\n-1\nKcal m-2 year\nPrimary Production: Same as primary productivity, but usually expressed for a whole ecosystem\n-1\ne.g.,\ntons year for a lake, cornfield, forest, etc.\nNET vs. GROSS:\nFor plants: Some of the organic carbon generated in plants through photosynthesis (using solar\nenergy) is oxidized back to CO2 (releasing energy) through the respiration of the plants - RA.\nGross Primary Production: (GPP) = Total amount of CO2 reduced to organic carbon by the plants\nper unit time\nAutotrophic Respiration: (RA) = Total amount of organic carbon that is respired (oxidized to CO2)\nby plants per unit time\nNet Primary Production (NPP) = GPP - RA\nThe amount of organic carbon produced by plants that is not consumed by their own respiration.\nIt is the increase in the plant biomass in the absence of herbivores.\nFor an entire ecosystem: Some of the NPP of the plants is consumed (and respired) by\nherbivores and decomposers and oxidized back to CO2 (RH). The amount of carbon that is left is\ncalled:\nNet Community Production (NCP) = Organic carbon produced through photosynthesis that is not\nlost through RA or RH.\nThus:\nNPP = GPP - RA\nNCP = GPP - RA - RH = NPP - RH\nProperties that can be calculated for ecosystems in steady state:\n(Note that \"biomass\" refers to the amount of living matter)\n-2\nmass\n(\nea\nBiomass/ar )\nm\ng\n(MRT)\nTime\nResidence\nMean\n=\nflux\n= (\nty\nProductivi\nPrimary\nGross\n) =\nm\ng\nyr\n= years\n-2\n-1\n(k)\nturnover\nFractional\n=\n= years-1 (x100 =\nyear)\nper\n%\nMRT\nMIT Department of Biology\n7.014 Introductory Biology, Spring 2005\n\nENERGY FLOW, FOOD WEBS, AND EFFICIENCIES\nPn = Productivity at trophic level n (net)\nPn-1 = Productivity at trophic level n-1 (net)\nRn = Respiration at trophic level n\nFn = Fecal matter produced at trophic level n\nIn = Amount Ingestedat trophic level n\nAn = Amount assimilated and available for metabolism\nDn = Fraction of Pn-1 not consumed by trophic level n\nBn = Biomass at trophic level n\nIn\nBn\nPn\nRn\nAn\nDn\nPn-1\nDead\nOrganic\nMatter\nTrophic Level n\nFn\nTo detritus food web\nWe can now define the following efficiences (%):\nExplotation Efficiency (EE), sometimes called consumption efficiency\nn\nEE = I\n×100\nn-1\nn\nIn/Pn-1\nTrees\nInsects\n1-10%\nPn-1\nGrass\nAnimals\n20%\nPhytoplankton\nZooplankton\n20-40%\nAssimilation Efficiency (AE)\nHerbivores ~ 20 - 50%\nAn\nAE = I ×100\nCarnivores ~ 80%\nn\nProduction Efficiency (PE)\nwarm-blooded organisms ~ 2%\nP\nP\nn\nn\nPE =\n×100 = P + R ×100\ncold-blooded organisms ~ 40%\nAn\nn\nn\nI\nA\nP\nP\nn ×\nn\nn\n×100 =\n×100\nEcological Efficiency\n= P n\nn\n-1\n×\nn\nn\nPn-1\nI\nA\n-\nTells us how much energy is lost in one trophic transfer in the grazing food chain\n-\nSome of this goes to the detritus food web, some goes to respiration"

      "content": "MIT Department of Biology\n7.014 Introductory Biology, Spring 2005\nRecitation Section 1 Answer Key\nFebruary 2-3, 2005\nBiology as a Science\nPlease read the following article. Class discussion will focus on the article, and center around the\nquestions that follow.\nPlease refer to the following article:\nLeake, Jonathan, Science editor. \"Mobile phones can cut a man's fertility by a third.\" The Sunday\nTimes - Britain, June 27, 2004.\n\n1. Based on the article, what was the hypothesis tested in this study?\nThe hypothesis was that heavy cell phone use negatively impacts sperm quality.\n2. What was the experiment designed to test the hypothesis?\nTo test the hypothesis, researchers followed a group of 221 men over the course of 13\nmonths, and compared sperm quality results of the men who used cell phones with\nresults of those who did not.\n3. What were the conclusions drawn from the results of the experiment?\nExperimental results showed that men who used their cell phones heavily had sperm\ncount that was 30% reduced when compared to men who did not use cell phones\nheavily. Moreover, they also found reduced morphology in the surviving sperm of the\ncell phone users. Researchers then concluded that heavy cell phone use causes reduced\nsperm quantity and quality.\n4. Are there alternative hypotheses that fit the data?\nOne alternative hypothesis is that heavy use of cell phones correlates with a life style\nthat causes reduced sperm quantity and morphology.\n5. Based on the article, do you think the researchers proved their hypothesis true? Is the quote\nfrom Dr. Fejes justified given the data? Why or why not?\nResearchers did not design the experiment to address alternative hypotheses, nor did\nthey perform follow up experiments to address such hypotheses. Therefore, we can not\nconclude that researchers proved their hypothesis true.\nNotice that in his quote, Dr. Fejes says that cell phone use \"may have a negative\neffect,\" rather than stating that it does. The statement as quoted is technically correct,\ngiven data. It is, however, significantly more modest than the claims the article makes\nabout the study.\n6. What follow-up experiments would need to be performed to validate the results of this study?\nOne such experiment would be to find a group of men with as homogeneous a lifestyle\nas possible, who do not use cell phones on regular basis. To establish the baseline, test\ntheir sperm quantity and quality for a short time (say, two months), and exclude any\nwho show bad results. Then randomly assign subjects to either the experimental or\ncontrol groups. Subjects in the experimental group would then receive cell phones, and\nfrequent calls on these cell phones from the researchers. Subjects in the control group\nwould lead their normal lifestyle. If the subjects in the experimental group show a\ndecrease in sperm quantity and quality, it would support the hypothesis that the cell\nphones cause reduced sperm quantity and quality. To further validate the hypothesis,\nanother group of subjects who do not use cell phones alot, but are put under stress\nwould be informative.\n7. Look again at the synopsis just below the title. Do you think it accurately describes the results\nof the study? Is it informative or misleading?\nThe synopsis is sensationalist, particularly in the last part of the sentence. Nowhere in\nthe article was it suggested that the study showed reduced chance of conception in men\nwho use cell phones heavily. In addition, the synopsis makes the results of the study\n\nsound a lot more convincing than they actually are by not alluding to alternative\nexplanations, and by using a relatively strong term \"suggested.\"\n8. Look again at the first and third paragraphs. Do you think the advice to put the phone in a bag\nwould be justified given the data we have now? Why or why not?\nThe advice, again, is not supported by evidence. Nowhere in the article does it say that\nthe men in the study who experienced reduced sperm count and quality do not already\ncarry their cell phones in their bags or briefcases.\n9. Look again at the description of how the study was performed in paragraph two. What would\nyou like to know about the procedures used in the study before concluding that the observed\nresults are not an artifact of how the study was done?\nLaboratory tests of sperm quality are usually performed on subjects who have abstained\nfrom sexual activity for 2-3 days. The article does not mention details of the study\nprocedures, so we do not know how often the sperm was tested, and whether the\nsubjects were told to abstain from sexual activity for any particular time before each\ntest. If this was not the case, the results may be artifacts of the sexual habits of the men\nin each group.\nMost sections spent some time talking about the scientific method and progression from observation to\ntheory or law. Below is a concise description of the process taken from\nhttp://phyun5.ucr.edu/~wudka/Physics7/Notes_www/node5.html\nThe scientific method is the best way yet discovered for winnowing the truth from lies and delusion.\nThe simple version looks something like this:\n1. Observe some aspect of the universe.\n2. Invent a tentative description, called a hypothesis, that is consistent with what you have\nobserved.\n3. Use the hypothesis to make predictions.\n4. Test those predictions by experiments or further observations and modify the hypothesis in the\nlight of your results.\n5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until there are no discrepancies between theory and experiment and/or\nobservation.\nWhen consistency is obtained the hypothesis becomes a theory and provides a coherent set of\npropositions which explain a class of phenomena. A theory is then a framework within which\nobservations are explained and predictions are made.\nThe site contains much more useful information on scientific method. Another good site on the subject\nis http://teacher.nsrl.rochester.edu/phy_labs/AppendixE/AppendixE.html"

      "content": "MIT Department of Biology\n7.014 Introductory Biology, Spring 2005\nRecitation Section 2 Answer Key\nFebruary 7-8, 2005\nBiochemistry--Molecules and Shapes\nShape Game\nEach group has three buckets. Bucket I containes pieces of type I, bucket II--of type II, and\nbucket III--of type III. The goal of this game is to see how many different kinds of structures\nyou can build from the pieces in your buckets. Each structure has to contain a piece of each\ntype. Please remember that as you put the structures together, the color spots have to match up in\nthe following way:\nBlue\nRed\nBlack\nSilver\nBlue\n√\n√\nRed\n√\n√\nBlack\n√\n√\n√\nSilver\n√\n1. How many structures were you able to put together?\nThere were 3 complete structures and a piece of type III that did not go with any\nof them. Three other structures can be put together, but they do not stay together\nas well.\n2. Are all your structures identical? If not, what are the differences?\nTwo of the structures have identical final complex shape, while the third does not.\nIn each complex pieces of types I and II are different than in any other complex.\n3. The pieces in your buckets represent three different molecules, that together work as a\ncomplex in a cell.\na). What dictates whether the pieces of type I, II, and III can form a complex?\nThe complex is put together via three-dimensional shape fitting and interactions\nof the chemical groups on the surface of the molecules.\nInteractions of the chemical groups are encoded in the colors:\nBlue and red--charged groups. Blue-red interactions represent ionic bonds.\nBlack--polar groups. Black-black, black-blue, and black-red interactions\nrepresent hydrogen bonds.\nSilver--hydrophobic groups. Silver-silver interactions represent hydrophobic\neffect.\nThe only thing you knew about each piece was its shape and coloring scheme\n(chemical properties). You put together complexes because they fit. In a similar\nsense, within a cell, two molecules interact because they can. And if they can,\nthey do. We will return to discussing this point and its implications for the rest of\nthis course at the end of the section.\n\nb). Can all pieces of type I work with all pieces of type II? If not, what are the restrictions\non the pieces in order for them to work together?\nEach piece of type I only fits perfectly with one piece of type II. The other\ncombinations do not work because the shapes of the type I and II pieces do not\nmatch each other.\nc).What conclusion about molecular interactions can you draw from b)?\nI. Molecular interactions are accomplished by 3D shape fitting and interactions\nof the chemical groups on the surface of the molecules.\nII. A change in the shape of a molecule can render it unable to interact with its\nbinding partners.\nIII. A complementary change in the shape of a binding partner molecule can\nrestore binding (and function).\n4. What is a protein?\nA protein is a biological macromolecule composed of one or more chains of\namino acids in a specific order.\n5. What are some of the other types of biological macromolecules in a cell?\nOther types of large molecules are nucleic acids (DNA and RNA), carbohydrates,\nand lipids.\n6. What is the connection between these types of molecules in the cell?\nDNA encodes proteins through an RNA intermediate. Some RNAs also perform\nother functions in the cell. Proteins do a lot of different things in the cell,\nincluding making new DNA, RNA, carbohydrates, and lipids.\n7. What are the four levels of protein structure?\nPrimary--the sequence of amino acids; secondary--the local secondary structure\n(α-helices and β-sheets); tertiary--three-dimensional structure; and\nquarternary--interactions between 3D structures, such as multiple peptides\nwithin a protein complex.\n8. If we consider our models to represent protein molecules, what level of protein structure\ndo the models represent?\nTertiary and quarternary.\n9. What is the first level of protein structure at which a change that led to the pieces of the\nsame type having different shapes would have occurred?\nPrimary--change in amino acid sequence causes the change in the 3D\nconformation of a protein.\n10. What are some of the different functions of proteins and protein complexes in a cell?\nProteins perform many varied functions in the cell. Some examples are:\nantibodies binding an antigen, cell-to-cell signaling molecules binding to surface\nreceptors, DNA polymerase synthesizing a new strand of DNA, lactase catalyzing\nthe breakdown of lactose. Broad categories of function of proteins are: make\n\nstuff, break stuff down, transport stuff, signal or propagate the signal, create or\nanchor structures. These categories can be further broken down into many\nsubcategories.\n11. Do all of these functions listed above require physical interaction of molecules? Why or\nwhy not?\nThe first step in all these and other functions in the cell is the physical contact and\nbinding between molecules. Without physical contact, a molecule can't \"tell\"\nany other molecule what to do. The only way information is propagated in a cell\nis through a series of binding events, and subsequent reactions. In a sense, any\nmolecule in a cell is also information about what happened to have the molecule\nbe present.\nAs we discussed, any molecule will bind any other molecule that it can, regardless\nof whether it is \"supposed\" to do so or not. The binding between molecules then\nfacilitates further events. This binding is only possible when 3D shapes of\nmolecules fit together, and the chemical identities of the groups on the surface\nallow for binding.\n12. If you were given only these three protein complexes, would you be able to decide\nwhether any of them would likely function normally in the cell? Why or why not?\nWe would not be able to say just from looking at the three versions of the complex\nwhether any except for the wild type would function normally in a cell because we\ndo not know what its next binding partner is. We also do not know how the\ncomplex interacts with its binding partner.\nWe would expect that any complex for which the areas of the molecule involved in\ninteracting with this next binding partner were unaffected by the changes in the\nprotein complex would likely function normally. However, if the complex in\nquestion can no longer bind its next expected binding partner, we would expect\nthat this modified complex would not function normally in a cell.\nEach team will now get a model of the binding pocket that the protein complex interacts with.\n13. Can all your protein complex models fit into the pocket?\nNo, one of the mutant complexes has an outer shape that excludes the ability to fit\ninto the pocket.\n14. What conclusions about protein interactions and transmission of information in the cell\ncan you draw?\nIV. We can draw the conclusion that retaining the binding of the complex (as\ndiscussed in 3c) above) is only useful if the complex retains its shape with respect\nto the next point of transmission of information, i.e. its next binding partner.\n15. On the molecular level, what is the only information available to the molecules? How do\nthey use this information to \"decide\" whether to bind another molecule?\nAs we discussed above, the only information available to molecules in a cell as to\nwhether they should bind another molecule is whether they can. And if they can,\nthey do.\n\n16. 7.014 contains a number of different units, most corresponding to different disciplines in\nbiology. Do you expect that learning about the principles behind molecular interactions\ntoday will help you with the material in the other units of the course? Why or why not?\nUnderstanding the principles behind molecular interactions will help you in all\nunits of the course focusing on the molecular and cellular levels because:\n-Molecules interact because they can.\n-The only information in a cell is shape and chemical identities.\n-These are encoded in or determined by other molecules which themselves have\nshapes, and the \"decoding\" itself proceeds by the same mechanism of shape\nfitting. I\n-Any other level at which we describe a biological system is an abstraction that\nultimately must have an explanation on this basic level of shape fitting and\ninteraction.\n-All ways to describe and study biological systems are ways to study properties\nof these interactions."

      "content": "MIT Department of Biology\n7.014 Introductory Biology, Spring 2005\nRecitation Section 3 Answer Key\nFebruary 9-10, 2005\nBiochemistry--Proteins\nA. CBS proteins, 3D representation\nThe protein we will consider today and periodically throughout the term is the yeast cystathionine beta\nsynthase (CBS) protein. Today we will see gels visualizing wild-type and mutants versions of the yeast\nCBS protein. Yeast that lack CBS protein can not synthesize the amino acid cysteine. Mutant versions\nof the human CBS protein can lead to a very serious disease called homocystinuria. Some symptoms\ninclude mental retardation, early strokes and heart disease.\nFirst consider a crystallographic model of a form of CBS protein. Open the CBS structure html file in\nInternet Explorer. Rotate the molecule and get an idea of the three dimensional structure of CBS.\nThe true 3-dimensional structure of CBS can be observed using the \"Show Spacefill\" button, and a\ntrace of the peptide backbone can be observed using the \"Show Ribbon\" button.\n1. What is the primary structure of a protein? What information does the modeling program\nprovide us about the primary structure of CBS?\nThe primary structure of a protein is the linear sequence of amino acids. It is\nimpossible to determine this for CBS with the representation that has been provided.\nWe could look up the sequence in the Protein Data Bank and it would read something\nlike (...Trp-Ile-Arg-Pro-Asp-Ala-Pro-Ser...) through all 430 amino acids.\n2. What is the secondary structure of a protein? What information does the modeling program\nprovide us about the secondary structure of CBS?\nThe secondary structure is described as α-helical or β-sheet. Remember that secondary\nstructure is controlled by backbone hydrogen bonds between amino acids. CBS\ncontains both types of secondary structure. The majority of the secondary structure\nelements are α-helices. There are 4 β-sheets.\n3. What is the tertiary structure of a protein? What information does the modeling program\nprovide us about the tertiary structure of CBS?\nThe tertiary structure is determined by the side-chain interactions between amino acids\nin adjacent secondary structures. Although it is hard to resolve the desired interactions\nfrom this view, it is clear that amino acids in both the α-helices and β-sheets are\ninteracting with amino acids in other secondary structure elements to contribute to the\noverall tertiary structure.\n4. What is the quaternary structure of a protein? What information does the modeling program\nprovide us about the quaternary structure of CBS? (Hint: Use the \"Color Ribbon by Protein\nSubunit\" button)\nThe quaternary structure of a protein is created by a number of distinct interacting\namino acid chains. If we color CBS by chain we find that there are two amino acid\nstrands indicating that the protein is a homodimer.\n\nB. Protein gels\n1. Yeast cells produce enough CBS to fulfill their needs depending on the conditions in which\nthey are growing. In order to procure large quantities of the enzyme, we created special\nbacterial cells that mostly produce CBS. After we grew up a large number of these bacterial\ncells, what did we have to do to end up with pure CBS for loading on the gel?\nWe had to grow up a lot of cells, break them all open, and then go through a gradual\nprocess of removing all parts of the cell we didn't need. We removed membranes,\nnucleic acids, carbohydrates, and small molecules. We then removed the majority of\nother proteins that were in the cell at the time of harvest, leaving us with mostly pure\nCBS.\nSome technical issues:\n2. What is a gel?\nA gel is a jelly-like matrix. Bigger objects have more trouble fitting through the matrix,\nand, therefore, travel slower through the gel.\n3. How does gel electrophoresis work?\nOur sample preparations and the buffer used in the gel set-up ensure that unfolded\nproteins have negative charge overall. When the electric current is applied, they move\ntoward the anode.\n4. If you run two proteins on the same gel, and one travels farther than the other, what can you say\nabout the relative sizes of these proteins?\nThe one that travels farther has lower molecular weight.\n5. With gel electrophoresis, two different conditions are often used.\na. Denaturing gel: detergent is added to the gel and a reducing agent is added to the\nprotein sample. Reducing agent converts the S-S disulfide bonds to SH and SH.\nb. Native gel: Physiological pH conditions where no detergent or reducing agent is added.\nCompare the 1°, 2°, 3°, and 4° structure of CBS for each of these conditions:\n\nDenaturing gel\nNative gel\n1°\nPrimary structure is not disrupted. Same as\nthat for CBS proteins present in a cell and\nfor those run on native gels.\nPrimary structure is not disrupted. Same as\nthat for CBS proteins present in a cell and\nfor those run on denaturing gels.\n2°\nSecondary structure lost due to presence of\ndetergent and reducing agent.\nSecondary structure is not disrupted. Same\nas that for CBS proteins present in a cell.\n3°\nTertiary structure lost due to presence of\ndetergent and reducing agent.\nTertiary structure is not disrupted. Same as\nthat for CBS proteins present in a cell.\n4°\nUnable to form quarternary structures due to\npresence of detergent and reducing agent.\nQuaternary structure is not disrupted. Same\nas that for CBS proteins present in a cell.\n6. Information about what level(s) of protein structure do you expect to gain from a denaturing\ngel?\n\nAdding detergent and a reducing agent ensures that the protein will lose its secondary\nand tertiary structure, so the information we get from running such a denaturing gel is\nthe size of each subunit of the protein complex.\n7. Information about what level(s) of protein structure do you expect to gain from a native gel?\nNot adding detergent and a reducing agent allows the protein to enter the gel as a 3D\nstructure, so we would be able to gain information about its apparent 3D size.\n8. What could the native gel tell you that the denaturing could not?\nThe native gel would provide information on the number of subunits involved in the\nprotein complex.\nLet's now talk about the proteins themselves.\nIn the 3D representation of the CBS protein, consider a single subunit of CBS. Now consider the whole\nCBS protein again.\n9. Which of these forms would we be visualizing with each kind of gel?\nA native gel would give us an opportunity to visualize the whole CBS protein, while the\ndenaturing gel would tell us the size of the individual subunit. These two pieces of\ninformation put together would tell us how many subunits are in each complete CBS\nprotein.\nImagine we are the researchers who first isolated the wild type and mutant versions of the protein.\nWhat kinds of things might we want to know about these proteins?\nThe five questions from journalism school are very much applicable here: Who? (What is this\nprotein?) What? (What does it do in the cell?) When? (When does it act?) Where? (Where does it act?)\nHow? (How does it perform its function? What does it interact with?). Note that these are all basic\nquestions that can be asked from first principles.\n10. Which of these things can we figure out by running the purified proteins on the gels and which\nones can't we? Why?\nWe can only get a part of the answer to the last question from the gel. This is because\nwe can not definitively answer questions about the protein's function and mode on\noperation in the cell without looking in the cell.\n11. What other techniques might you want to employ in your research of the purified protein?\nWhat would you hope to find out from these experiments?\nIf we determined by other means that this is an enzyme, we could try to determine what\nreaction the protein catalyzes by seeing whether any of the known or suspected\nsubstrates will be acted upon. We could also determine whether the enzyme needs a\ncofactor, such as any of the known small molecule co-factors.\nC. Analyzing the data and interpreting the results\nTake a look at the denaturing gels. One of our proteins migrates a shorter distance than the other.\n\n1. What does this mean?\nIt means that the protein that migrates a shorter distance is longer, i.e. has more amino\nacids in its primary structure.\n2. As we said earlier, we ran both the wild-type and mutant protein on the denaturing gel. Which\ndo you expect to be longer--wild-type or mutant protein? Why?\nIt could be either. A number of different mutations in the DNA sequence coding for a\nprotein can create a shorter protein, by prematurely creating a stop instruction. On the\nother hand, a mutation that disrupts an existing stop instruction for this protein can\nresult in creating a longer protein.\nIn this particular case, the mutant protein travels farther on the gel, and we, therefore,\nconclude that the mutant protein is shorter than the wild-type protein.\nTake a look at the photocopy of a native gel.\n3. What can you say about the difference between the wild type and the mutant enzymes from the\nnative gels?\nNative gel data indicates that the mutant protein forms dimers, while the wild-type\nprotein forms tetramers and octamers.\n4. Would you expect the same section of the monomer subunit of CBS to be used in forming\ndimers as in forming tetramers? Why or why not?\nNo. The mutant subunit is shorter, so we conclude that it is missing a portion of the\namino acid chain with respect to the wild-type protein. The mutant can still form\ndimers, but not tetramers and octamers. Therefore, we expect different parts of the\nmonomer subunit to be involved in establishing each of these interactions.\n5. Do you think the 3D representation we are working with today is of the wild-type or mutant\nprotein? Why?\nThe representation is of the mutant protein because it shows dimer as the quarternaty\nstructure of the enzyme, and not a tetramer or an octamer.\nLet's now look at the dimer interface that forms between the two chains. There are several important\ninteractions that hold the two subunits together. We will look at some residues involved in keeping the\ninterface together.\nI. Choose \"Central Interaction\"\n6. What are the residues involved in this interaction?\nHint: It may help to change the representation of the residues to ball and stick by clicking in the\nbox labeled \"Ball and Stick on/off\" below the 3D window\nPhenylalanine from one chain interact with phenylalanine from the other chain.\n7. What types of amino acids are these residues (acidic, basic, polar, or hydrophobic)?\nPhenylalanine is hydrophobic.\n8. What types of interactions occur between these residues?\nThe two phenylalanines interact via a Van Der Waals interaction.\n\n9. Would the CBS dimer interface be more, less or equally as stable if we changed one of the\nphenylalanines to a glutamic acid? An alanine? A tryptophan?\nA glutamic acid in this position would probably destabilize the interface because it is very\npolar and positively charged, while phenylalanine is a hydrophobic bulky ring.\nAn alanine in this position would also probably destabilize the protein, because although it\nis hydrophobic, it is very small whereas phenylalanine is quite bulky. The alanine would\nintroduce a hole or gap in the dimer interface due to its small size.\nIntroduction of tryptophan in this position would be the residue most likely not to\ndestabilize the dimer interface. It is large, aromatic, and hydrophobic, and therefore,\nretains a majority of the qualities of phenylalanine.\nII. Choose \"Interaction I\"\n10. We have highlighted two identical clusters at opposite ends of the CBS structure. Each\nindividual cluster contains an alanine and a leucine from chain A and an alanine and a leucine\nfrom chain B. What type of amino acids are alanine and leucine?\nAlanine and leucine both have hydrophobic side chains.\n11. What type(s) of interaction(s) are the amino acids in these clusters involved in?\nThese residues interact via hydrophobic interactions and van der Waals interactions.\nHydrophobic interaction refers to a situation where a number of hydrophobic amino acids\nare clustered together, unlike a case where only two hydrophobic amino acids are involved\nin the interaction. In the latter case we say that the strongest interaction is van der Waals\n(see question 8 above). Notice that when hydrophobic interaction is happening, van der\nWaals forces are still present, but are not the strongest interaction.\n12. Would you expect the side chains in this cluster to be exposed to the cytoplasm? Why or why\nnot?\nWe would not expect the side chains to be exposed to the cytoplasm because the cytoplasm\nis primarily composed of water and contains many other polar molecules. An interaction\nbetween the nonpolar, hydrophobic side chains of alanine and leucine and water would be\nhighly unfavorable. We expect most hydrophobic clusters to be located on the inside of\nglobular proteins.\nIII. Choose \"Interaction II\"\n13. We have highlighted two identical clusters at far ends of the CBS structure. Each individual\ncluster contains a glutamine and an aspartic acid on one chain, and a lysine on the other. What\ntypes of amino acids are these residues?\nGlutamine has a polar side chain, aspartic acid has an acidic side chain, and lysine has a\nbasic side chain.\n14. What type(s) of interaction(s) are found in this cluster?\nGlutamine may interact with either lysine or aspartic acid via a hydrogen bond. Lysine and\naspartic acid bond together via an ionic bond.\n\n15. Select \"Interaction II with all atoms shown.\" This view shows all the atoms of CBS (not\nincluding hydrogens) as transparent dots. Are the amino acids involved in Interaction III found\non the exterior or interior of the protein? Does this make sense if CBS is a soluble protein?\nThese amino acids are on the exterior of surface of CBS. It would be energetically\nfavorable for this cluster to be exposed to a hydrophilic solvent like the cytoplasm or water\nbecause the amino acid side chains involved in this cluster could hydrogen bond with other\npolar molecules.\n16. Choose \"Show Surface Hydrophobics.\" This colors all the hydrophobic residues of CBS\npink. Are there a lot or a few surface exposed hydrophobic amino acids? Does this make\nsense? For what purpose could the protein use surface exposed hydrophobic resides?\nThere a quite a few hydrophobic residues on the surface of CBS. Most of them are\nscattered throughout the surface and are not found in distinct clusters. This is typical of\nmost soluble proteins. It allows them to remain stable, and to sometimes interact with other\nproteins or to bind hydrophobic ligands.\nCBS is normally found in a tetrameric or octameric conformation. The wild-type CBS\nprotein uses some of the hydrophobic amino acids on its surface, along with the domain\nmissing in the mutant protein, to bind other CBS molecules.\nBack to the gel data.\n17. Do you expect the mutant enzyme to be active? Why or why not?\nUnclear from data. It depends on what the function(s) are of the domain of the protein\nthat was lost in the mutant.\n18. The in-gel activity assay actually indicates that the mutant protein is active. What do you think\nis the function of the missing domain?\nIt is possible that the missing domain is only responsible for making tetramers and\noctamers. It could also have function that we have not analyzed yet.\n19. Suppose a colleague in the lab next door has figured out that the mutant protein is active in the\ncell all the time, while the wild type protein is active only some of the time. What conclusion\nmight you draw from this information in combination with your data?\nThe domain missing in the mutant appears to also have regulatory function that allows\nthe protein to be in either active or inactive conformation."

Today we will see gels visualizing wild-type and mutants versions of the yeast\nCBS protein. Yeast that lack CBS protein can not synthesize the amino acid cysteine.

How does gel electrophoresis work?\n4. If you run two proteins on the same gel, and one travels farther than the other, what can you say\nabout the relative sizes of these proteins?\n5. With gel electrophoresis, two different conditions are often used.\na. Denaturing gel: detergent is added to the gel and a reducing agent is added to the\nprotein sample. Reducing agent converts the S-S disulfide bonds to SH and SH.\nb.

      "content": "MIT Department of Biology\n7.014 Introductory Biology, Spring 2005\nRecitation Section 4 Answer Key\nFebruary 14-15, 2005\nBiochemistry--Energy and Glycolysis\nA. Why do we care\nIn lecture we discussed the three properties of a living organism: metabolism, regulated growth, and\nreplication. Today we will focus on metabolism and biosynthesis.\n1. It was said in lecture that chemical reactions are the basis of life. Why do we say that?\nBeing alive implies being able to change your state in response to a change in internal\nor environmental conditions. We discussed previously that any change in the\nobservable characteristics of a cell begins as and is propagated by molecular\ninteractions. Molecular interactions propagate the signal by changing the state of\nmolecules, i.e. by reactions.\n2. Why is metabolism required for life?\nA cell is subject to all laws of chemistry and physics, including the first and second law\nof thermodynamics. Changing the state of molecules dissipates energy along the way, so\ngetting or making new energy is essential to life. The energy is then used for many\npurposes, including making the building blocks and precursors and then using them to\nbuild macromolecules that make up cells--biosynthesis.\n3. Can an entity that performs no chemical reactions be considered \"alive?\"\nIn general, no. But there are special cases of the cells that do not perform reactions\nright at the moment, but have the potential to perform reactions if they encounter\nparticular conditions. Some examples of such cells are spores in nature or frozen\npermanents in laboratory. If they experience certain conditions, such as availability of\nfood for spores, or defrosting and food source for frozen permanents, these cells will\nagain perform metabolism.\n4. Most reactions necessary for life are unfavorable, or do not proceed at an appreciable rate under\nphysiological conditions. How do cells overcome this problem?\nSeveral mechanisms exist to allow necessary but unfavorable reactions to proceed or to\nspeed up to levels required for cellular function. Below we explore the following\nmechanisms:\n-Enzymes,\n-concentration gradients, and\n-coupling unfavorable reactions with favorable ones, including\n-using the common energy currency, ATP.\nB. Thermodynamics\n1. What is \"free energy\"?\n\"Free energy\" (defined by Gibbs, so we use the symbol G) is the total amount of energy\nin a system that can be used to do work. By definition,\n∆G = \"the total free energy of products\" - \"the total free energy of reactants\"\n\n2. Where is this energy stored?\nThe energy is stored in the bonds of the reactant and product molecules.\nWe say that ∆G is a thermodynamic property, meaning that it is independent of the way that the\nconversion of reactants to products might proceed.\n3. Based on how energy is stored in the molecules, explain why ∆G is independent of the path of\nthe reaction.\nThe energy is stored in the bonds. Regardless of how the reaction proceeds (all in one\nstep, or in 10 steps, like glycolysis), the products will still look like the same exact\nmolecules. Thus, the amount of energy stored in the bonds of the products will still be\nthe same, and the difference in energy levels between reactants and products will still\nbe the same.\n4. If ∆G=0, the reaction is at equilibrium. What then is the meaning of the magnitude of ∆G?\nThe magnitude of ∆G is the measure of the amount of work that can be done by a\nchemical reaction before it reaches equilibrium.\n5. What is a favorable reaction? What would ∆G be for a thermodynamically favorable reaction?\nA favorable, or exergonic, reaction is one in which the energy state of reactants is\nhigher than that of the products (∆G<0).\n6. What is an unfavorable reaction? What would ∆G be for a thermodynamically unfavorable\nreaction?\nAn unfavorable, or endergonic, reaction is the one in which the energy state of the\nproducts is higher than that of the reactants (∆G>0).\n7. Not all thermodynamically favorable reactions proceed on their own. Why?\nSome reactions with negative ∆G still do not proceed at an appreciable rate. This is\nusually because some intermediate is in a significantly higher energy state than the\nreactants. The difference between the energy state of the reactants and such an\nintermediate is known as activation energy (Ea).\n8. Catalysts overcome this problem. How do they do it?\nCatalysts (most often protein enzymes) lower the activation energy of the reaction, thus\nallowing the reaction to proceed. They sometimes accomplish this by physically\npositioning reactants in a way that brings parts of the molecules that will participate in\nthe reaction in close contact.\nA + B\nA + BC\nA\nB\nC\nAB + C\n+ C\nTransition state\nReactants\nFree Energy\nFree Energy\nProducts\nEa\nG\n∇\nFigure by MIT OCW.\nFigure by MIT OCW.\nA\nB\nC\nTransition state\nansition state\nA + B\nA + B\nA + BC\nReactants\nFree Energy\nAB + C\nProducts\nEa\na without\nenzyme\nEa\na with\nenzyme\n\n9. Is the equilibrium of the reaction affected by the action of a catalyst? Why or why not?\nThe equilibrium of the reaction (relative concentrations of reactants and products) is\nnot affected by the presence of the catalyst. This is because the equilibrium is\ndetermined by the amount of energy available to perform the work of converting\nreactants to products and vice versa. Since the energy is stored in the bonds, it is\nindependent of the path the reaction takes, or the rate at which it occurs.\n10. Is the rate of the reaction affected by the action of a catalyst? Why or why not?\nThe rate of reaction is affected. Reactants reach the transition state due to random\nfluctuations in energy caused by molecular motion. If Ea is lowered, much less energy is\nrequired to reach it, so more molecules will be able to do so, and the rate of the\nreaction will increase.\n11. Why can the direction in which a reaction proceeds be influenced by the relative concentration\nof reactants and products?\nIf you have more molecules of a particular kind, it is more probable that some of them\nwill reach the high energy state of the transition state.\nC. Kinetics\nAs mentioned in lecture, effect of enzymes can be quantified. The measures commonly used, Km and\nVmax are characteristic of different aspects of enzyme's actions. To illustrate these concepts, we will\nbreak into groups of four for the following experiment.\nAll members of the group will try to pick up from the desk and open as many eppendorf tubes as\npossible in a 45 second interval. One member in each group will use the hand with taped down thumb,\nanother with the other four fingers taped together, and the last person will use a hand in a ski glove.\n1. How many eppendorf tubes was each member of the team able to pick up and open in 45\nseconds?\nhand\n\n-thumb\n\n-fingers\n\nski glove\nlow\nmedium\nhigh\n2. What problems with enzyme functions does the demo represent?\nProblems illustrated by the demo--defective binding interactions with substrates (taped\nfingers), ability to catalyze the reaction (taped thumb), similar but wrong enzyme (ski\nglove).\n\nData gathered in an enzyme kinetics experiment can be represented on a graph of concentration of\nsubstrate vs. initial rate of the reaction.\n\n3. Why does the curve level off?\nVmax is the property of the enzyme at a fixed concentration. The curve levels off because\nthe enzyme is saturated. It doesn't have to go looking for substrate--there is so much of\nit around, that the rate-limiting step is actually the catalysis.\nKm is the measure of how well an enzyme binds the substrate--the less substrate it takes to achieve\nhalf maximal speed, the better is the affinity of the enzyme for the substrate.\n\n4. How would the curve below change for the mutants described in the demo?\nFor the mutant defective in binding the substrate, Km would be higher, but Vmax should\nremain the same--if enzyme is saturated, the catalysis is the rate-limiting step.\nFor the mutant defective in the active site, Vmax would decrease. Km might actually\ndecrease as well due to the maximal speed being lower than before, while the affinity\nfor the substrate stays the same.\nFor the similar, but wrong enzyme, Km would likely rise, while Vmax falls--the affinity is\nworse, and the catalysis is slower.\n\nD. Energy currency\nEnzymes can not make thermodynamically unfavorable reactions proceed. But they do lower the\nactivation energy of a reaction in both directions.\n[S]\nKM\nVmax/2\nVmax\nV\nFigure by MIT OCW.\nFigure by MIT OCW.\nInitial Rate, v\nSubstrate Concentration, [S]\n\n1. What strategy can a cell use to drive slightly thermodynamically unfavorable catalyzed\nreactions? How can this be achieved in a cell?\nAs discussed above, skewing the concentrations in favor of reactants can drive such a\nreaction forward. This can be achieved by immediately siphoning off any newly formed\nproducts, thus maintaining the concentration gradient.\nSometimes the reaction is just too thermodynamically unfavorable to be driven by such tricks.\n2. What is the strategy used by the cell to drive such reactions?\nIn the cell, energetically unfavorable reactions are often coupled with favorable ones,\nsuch that the new overall reaction is favorable.\nWe say that ATP is the energy currency of the cell.\n3. Why does it make sense to have energy currency?\nBy producing ATP whenever possible, the cell can store the excess energy to fuel\nendergonic reactions whenever needed.\n4. Where in ATP is the energy available to do work stored?\nIn ATP energy is stored in the bonds. The most unfavorable of these bonds is the bond\nbetween the second and third phosphates.\n5. What makes ATP a good candidate for the position of energy currency in the cell?\nThe third phosphate can be removed, releasing a lot of energy. This phosphate can\nactually be transferred to one of the reactants, taking that molecule to a higher energy\nstate, and allowing a previously non-spontaneous reaction to proceed.\nATP is also a building block of RNA.\n6. Given what you know about the early history of life on Earth, why does this make sense?\nIt is believed that early in evolution there were very few molecules around. The\ntriphosphate feature of ATP made it a good candidate for energy storage, and once the\npathway was developed, it became a selective liability to change it too much.\nAs we discussed on the first day of class, many key pathways, such as glycolysis, are\nancient, and trace their origin to the early stages of evolution of life on Earth.\nE. Glycolysis\nGlycolysis is an ancient pathway. It is critically important for producing ATP. It is an incremental\npathway, meaning that it takes a number of steps (10) to get from the initial reactant (glucose) to the\nfinal products. Below in the energy diagram of glycolysis.\n\nAs you can see from the diagram, the overall reaction is very favorable (∆G < -130).\n1. Why do the first six steps of the pathway have a positive ∆G?\nThe pathway involves adding energy to reactants until the can extract energy from\nthem.\n2. Is this the most efficient way to design a pathway glucoseÆ pyruvate? If you were able to\ndesign it de novo, would you be able to come up with a better way?\nThe pathway is likely not the most efficient possible. There are likely much more\nefficient solutions possible.\n3. As we mentioned a number of times, this pathway is highly evolutionarily conserved. Why?\nOnce the pathway was developed, any mutant (M) of the pathway that accidentally\narises is likely to be less efficient at extracting ATP from glucose. Even if some\ndescendant of M, M1, if it was to acquire another mutation, might end up being\nsignificantly better than the original non-mutant organism, M itself is not likely to\nsurvive or generate enough progeny to allow M1 to ever appear. Thus, evolutionary\npressure works against changes to key pathways, ensuring significant conservation\nthroughout evolution.\n4. Speculate about how this pathway might have arisen.\nMaybe could get ATP from 1,3diphosphoglycerate. Developed an enzyme to get from\nG3P to 1,3.... Etc. Energy investment to get up to the certain level from which can get\ndown.\n5. What is the energy gain from the glycolysis pathway?\nThe net energy gain from glycolysis is only 2 ATP molecules.\n6. Is this enough energy to allow for the development of the diverse set of organisms populating\nthe biosphere?\nNo, the gain of 2ATP molecules from a molecule of glucose is not enough to fuel more\ncomplicated organisms that populate the biosphere today. For that, photosynthesis and\nrespiration needed to develop. This is why it can be said that O2 is the engine of\nevolution. We will look at these new ways of making ATP in the next section.\nGlucose\nGlycolysis\nG6P\nF6P\nFBP\n-140\n-150\n-130\n-120\n-110\n-100\n-90\n-80\n-70\n-60\n-50\n-40\n-30\n-20\n-10\n{\nG3P + DAP\nG3P\nBPG\n3PG\n2PG\nPEP\nPyruvate\nChange in free energy, ∆G (in kilocalories)\nFigure by\nMIT OCW."

What would ∆G be for a thermodynamically unfavorable\nreaction?\n7. Not all thermodynamically favorable reactions proceed on their own. Why?\n8. Catalysts overcome this problem. How do they do it?\n\n9. Is the equilibrium of the reaction affected by the action of a catalyst? Why or why not?\n10. Is the rate of the reaction affected by the action of a catalyst? Why or why not?\n11. Why can the direction in which a reaction proceeds be influenced by the relative concentration\nof reactants and products?\nC. Kinetics\nAs mentioned in lecture, effect of enzymes can be quantified. The measures commonly used, Km and\nVmax are characteristic of different aspects of enzyme's actions. To illustrate these concepts, we will\nbreak into groups of four for the following experiment.\nAll members of the group will try to pick up from the desk and open as many eppendorf tubes as\npossible in a 45 second interval. One member in each group will use the hand with taped down thumb,\nanother with the other four fingers taped together, and the last person will use a hand in a ski glove.\n1. How many eppendorf tubes was each member of the team able to pick up and open in 45\nseconds?\nhand\n\n-thumb\n\n-fingers\n\nski glove\nlow\nmedium\nhigh\n2. What problems with enzyme functions does the demo represent?\n\nData gathered in an enzyme kinetics experiment can be represented on a graph of concentration of\nsubstrate vs. initial rate of the reaction.\n3. Why does the curve level off?\n\nKm is the measure of how well an enzyme binds the substrate--the less substrate it takes to achieve\nhalf maximal speed, the better is the affinity of the enzyme for the substrate.\n\n4. How would the curve below change for the mutants described in the demo?\nD. Energy currency\n\nEnzymes can not make thermodynamically unfavorable reactions proceed. But they do lower the\nactivation energy of a reaction in both directions.\n\nFigure by MIT OCW.\nFigure by MIT OCW.\n[S]\nKM\nVmax/2\nVmax\nV\nInitial Rate, v\nSubstrate Concentration, [S]\n\n1. What strategy can a cell use to drive slightly thermodynamically unfavorable catalyzed\nreactions? How can this be achieved in a cell?\nSometimes the reaction is just too thermodynamically unfavorable to be driven by such tricks.\n2. What is the strategy used by the cell to drive such reactions?\nWe say that ATP is the energy currency of the cell.\n3. Why does it make sense to have energy currency?\n4. Where in ATP is the energy available to do work stored?\n5. What makes ATP a good candidate for the position of energy currency in the cell?\nATP is also a building block of RNA.\n6. Given what you know about the early history of life on Earth, why does this make sense?\nE. Glycolysis\nGlycolysis is an ancient pathway. It is critically important for producing ATP. It is an incremental\npathway, meaning that it takes a number of steps (10) to get from the initial reactant (glucose) to the\nfinal products. Below in the energy diagram of glycolysis.\n\nAs you can see from the diagram, the overall reaction is very favorable (∆G < -130).\n1. Why do the first six steps of the pathway have a positive ∆G?\n2. Is this the most efficient way to design a pathway glucoseÆ pyruvate? If you were able to\ndesign it de novo, would you be able to come up with a better way?\n3. As we mentioned a number of times, this pathway is highly evolutionarily conserved. Why?\n4. Speculate about how this pathway might have arisen.\n5. What is the energy gain from the glycolysis pathway?\n6.

      "content": "MIT Department of Biology\n7.014 Introductory Biology, Spring 2005\nRecitation Section 5\nFebruary 16-17, 2005\nBiochemistry--Photosynthesis and Respiration\nA. Photosynthesis background\n1. Why do we consider O2 a booster of evolution?\nThe organisms doing only glycolysis were slow and small. The net gain of 2ATP molecules from\na molecule of glucose is not enough to fuel more complicated organisms that populate the\nbiosphere today. For that, photosynthesis and respiration needed to develop. The waste product\nof non-cyclic photosynthesis is O2, and its presence allowed respiration to develop, since O2\ncould be used as an electron acceptor.\n2. Why was it advantageous for a cell to develop photosynthesis?\nWhen abiotic sources of energy started to decline, it became advantageous to have the ability to\nmake ATP. While glycolysis allows an organism to make ATP, it requires a source of organic\ncarbon. Developing photosynthesis allowed an organism to become an autotroph--make\neverything it needs from CO2, NH3, PO4, H2O. Thus, in the environment low in abiotic sources of\nenergy and carbohydrates photosynthetic organisms have selective advantage.\n3. Photosynethesis has two phases--light and dark. What does each phase accomplish?\nThe light phase is so named because it is dependent on the presence of light to drive its\nreactions. Light phase reactions use the energy of the excited chlorophylls to make ATP and\nNADPH, while producing O2 as a waste product.\nThe dark phase is so named because it is independent from the presence of light. Dark phase is\nalso known as a biosynthetic phase--the phase in which atmospheric CO2 is fixed into organic\ncarbon.\nB. Photosynthesis--light reactions\n1. Below are the schematics for cyclic and noncyclic photophosphorylation. Identify each schematic and\ndiscuss the order of steps in each process.\nPS1\nPS2\nElectron acceptor\nElectron acceptor\nA2\nAcceptor 3\nStroma\nThylakoid\nmembrane\nATP\nsynthase\nH+\nH+\nH+\nH+\nH+\nH+\nH+\nH+\nH+\nH+ H+\nH+\nADP+ Pi\nATP\n\nNADPH NADP+\nPS1\nPS2\nElectron acceptor\nElectron acceptor\nA2\nAcceptor 3\nStroma\nThylakoid\nmembrane\nATP\nsynthase\nH+\nH+\n2H+\nH+\nH+\nH+\nH+\nH+\nH+\nH+ H+\nH+\nADP+ Pi\nATP\nA2'\nH2O\n2e\n1⁄2 (O2)\nFirst schematic is of cyclic photophosphorylation. Steps:\n1) The process starts when a photon hits a PS1(photosystem 1) chloroplast, exciting two\nelectrons on the molecule.\n2) The two electrons are donated to the electron acceptor (creating a \"hole\" in the molecule),\nthen\n3) Passed to Acceptor 2(A2), and on to Acceptor 3 [both of these have names, but you do not\nneed to remember them]. The later step powers the active transport of hydrogen ions from\nstroma into the thylakoid space.\n4) Electrons pass from Acceptor 3 back to the PS1 chloroplast (thus, filling the \"hole\" in the\nmolecule left by the electrons in step 2)).\n5) H+ gradient drives the ions through the ATP synthase, powering the addition of a Pi to an\nADP, creating ATP.\nSecond schematic is of noncyclic photophosphorylation. Steps:\n1) The process starts when a photon hits a PS2(photosystem 2) chloroplast, exciting two\nelectrons on the molecule.\n2) The two electrons are donated to the electron acceptor (creating a \"hole\" in the molecule).\n3) Water is split in the thylakoid, providing the electrons to fill the \"hole\" in the PS2\nmolecule. O2 is released as waste product. 2H+ ions are created, to be used in step 7 below.\n4) Electrons from the acceptor are passed to A2', and on to Acceptor 3 [again, all of these\nhave names, but you do not need to remember them]. The later step powers the active\ntransport of hydrogen ions from stroma into the thylakoid space.\n5) Electrons pass from Acceptor 3 to the PS1 chloroplast that was hit by a separate photon,\nexciting it, and creating a \"hole.\"\n6) Electrons from the PS1 chloroplast are passed on to the electron acceptor and on to A2.\n7) Electrons on A2 and the protons generated in step 3 are used to reduce NADP+ to\nNADPH+H+.\n8) H+ gradient drives the ions through the ATP synthase, powering the addition of a Pi to an\nADP, creating ATP.\n\n2. What are the main differences between the two processes?\nIn cyclic photophosphorylation, electrons come back to chloroplast molecules, while in\nnoncyclic photophosphorylation, the splitting of water provides the electrons to \"compensate\"\nthe original chloroplast, and produces O2 as waste product. In addition, noncyclic\nphotophosphorylation produces NADPH as well as ATP. Cyclic photophosphorylation only\nproduces ATP.\n3. What is the ATP made in photosynthesis used for?\nIt is mostly used in dark reactions of photosynthesis to fix CO2 into glucose.\n4. In class we learned that cyclic photophosphorylation produces S as waste product. Yet we do not see S\ncreated anywhere in the schematic above. Where and how is S released?\nIn order to fix CO2 into organic carbon, a lot of reducing power is needed. This power is\nprovided by NADPH. In cyclic photophosphorylation as we described it so far no NADPH is\nproduced. Another, side reaction is run to produce NADPH from NADP+. In that reaction, H2S\nserves as an electron donor, and S is released as waste product.\n5. Why do cells need to make glucose out of ATP? Why not just use the ATP produced in photosynthesis?\n-Hard to store ATP (for long term storage, want\ncurrency in gold, not $)\n-Need glucose for other pathways.\nIntricate web of pathways--allows a non-\nphotosynthetic cell (a heterotroph) to live on\nsugar source alone, or a photosynthetic cell (an\nautotroph) to build everything it needs from a\nsmall number of precursors. Many reactions\nalong the way are endergonic--use ATP to\npower them.\nC. Aerobic Respiration - Oxidative Phosphorylation\nDark reactions of photosynthesis are expensive, and glycolysis only produces 2 molecules of ATP.\nThis is very inefficient.\n1. What process developed to derive energy from glucose more efficiently? Why was it not\npossible to develop this process before noncyclic photophosphorylation arose?\nOxidative phosphorylation, or respiratory chain, or electron transport chain. The\nprocess requires O2 as the final electron acceptor, so it could not have arisen before the\nadvent of noncyclic photophosphorylation.\n2. Why was it evolutionarily advantageous for a cell to develop aerobic respiration?\nAn organism that can utilize its energy reserves more efficiently does not need to make\nor import from the environment as much glucose as a less efficient organism. Thus, in\nthe environment with limited abiotic sources of glucose or sunlight, an organism that\ncan perform respiration would have selective advantage.\nFigure removed due to copyright reasons.\nPlease see:\nhttp://www.biologie.uni-hamburg.de/b-online/e19_1/metabol.htm\n___________________________________________\n\nBelow is a schematic of the mitochondrial membrane and surrounding compartments.\n3. Using the schematic, explain why an NADH is \"worth\" 3 ATPs.\nWhen an NADH molecule donates an electron. That electron is passed through an\nelectron transport chain. Three membrane proteins that take part in the chain are\npowered by this electron to transport a proton from the inner mitochondrial\ncompartment to the outer mitochondrial compartment. Finally, the electron is accepted\nby O2, generating water. The protons that were transported to the outer compartment\nnow have a large gradient--it is energetically favorable for these protons to get back\ninto the inner compartment. However, the only way they can do so is by passing\nthrough the ATP synthase, which uses their chemiosmotic energy to power the addition\nof a phosphate to an ADP molecule, creating ATP. Because each NADH molecule\naccounts for three protons pumped into the outer compartment, it helps generate three\nnew ATP molecules. Thus, 1 NADH is worth 3 ATPs.\nOn the way to complete oxidation, each pyruvate molecule generates 4 NADH molecules, one FADH2\nmolecule, and one ATP molecule. FADH2 can participate in the proton gradient mechanism as well,\nbut only generates 2 molecules of ATP for each molecule of FADH2.\n4. In lecture it was said that 36 molecules of ATP total are derived from a glucose molecule via\nglycolysis followed by aerobic respiration. Describe where these ATP molecules come from.\nGlycolysis generates 2 molecules of ATP, 2 molecules of NADH, and 2 molecules of\npyruvate. Each molecule of pyruvate is worth 15 ATPs (4NADHÆ 12ATPs; FADH2 Æ\n2 ATPs, and one ATP molecule generated along the oxidation route). Taking into\naccount the two ATPs from glycolysis, that makes 32ATPs. Taking into account the 2\nNADHs from glycolysis, we should be looking at 38 ATPs. However, two ATPs are\nspent moving the electrons from these NADHs produced in the cytoplasm into the\nmitochondria, where ETC can take place. So overall count is 36 ATPs from each\nmolecule of glucose.\nMitochondrion\nOuter Membrane\nInner\nMembrane\nElectron\nTransport\nChain\nMolecules\nInner\nCompartment\nNADH\nNAD\nProton\nPump\nATP\nChannel\nATP Synthetase\nOuter\nCompartment\nH+\nH+\nH+\nH+\nH+\nH+\nH+\nH+\nH+\nH+\nH+\nH+\nH+\nH+\nH+\nH+\nH+\nH+\n+\nO -\nP + ADP\n2H + 1/2 O2\n+\nATP\nATP\nH O\nFigure by MIT OCW."
