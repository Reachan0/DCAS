  "syllabus_content": "Course Meeting Times\n\nLectures: 1 session / week, 3 hours / session\n\nCourse Description\n\nThe social study of science and technology is an interdisciplinary field dedicated to understanding science as social practice. Braiding together insights from history and philosophy of science, sociology of scientific institutions and knowledge, anthropology, feminism, critical race theory, post-colonial studies, and queer theory, science studies views sciences and technologies as crucially enmeshed in human culture and politics. This course surveys canonical and recent theories and methods in science studies. We will organize our discussions around the concept of \"reproduction,\" referring variously to:\n\nScientific reproduction (how results are replicated in lab, field, disciplinary contexts)\n\nSocial reproduction (how social knowledge and relations are regenerated over time)\n\nBiological reproduction (how organic substance is managed in the genetic age)\n\nElectronic reproduction (how information is reassembled in techniques of transcription, simulation, computation). Examining intersections and disruptions of these genres of reproduction, we seek to map relations among our social, biological, and electronic lives.\n\nRequirements\n\nThis is a seminar. Students are required to give at least one seminar presentation, offering a critical evaluation of positions represented in the readings for their chosen day. There are two writing assignments: a short paper (5 pages) on course readings up through lecture 6 (due lecture 7), and a 15-20 page research paper using course materials to discuss a case study of science in society (a prospectus for this paper will be due on lecture 8 and the final paper will be due on lecture 14, in time for our class conference). 30% of the grade will be based on in-class participation, 20% on short paper, and 50% on research paper.\n\nRequired Books\n\nLatour, Bruno, and Steve Woolgar.\nLaboratory Life: The Construction of Scientific Facts\n.
