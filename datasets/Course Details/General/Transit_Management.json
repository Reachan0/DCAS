      "content": "1.259 Spring 2005\nAssignment #1\nDue: Lecture 8\n\nNOTE: You should form teams of two for this assignment.\n\nContracted Services\n\nThere is increasing interest in the U.S. and elsewhere in having various types of public transport\nservice provided under contract by the private sector. While there may be some financial\nadvantage to this, there are also some difficulties, notably those of contract specification,\nperformance monitoring, and transition management. This assignment deals with one such\ncontract service, the MBTA Commuter Rail, which provides regional rail service into Boston.\nCurrently the MBTA is in the second year of a new contract with a consortium (MBCR, LLC)\nthat took over this service from Amtrak on July 1, 2003. Amtrak previously had operated this\nservice since 1987.\n\nAttached is the body of the new contract, along with a set of the major Exhibits to the contract\n(Exhibits 1, 2, 3 [sections 1-3 only], 4 [pp 1-2], 5 [sample pages], 9,10, and 14).\n\nAfter reviewing the current contract, write the following:\n\n1.\nA critical analysis of the current contract from the perspective of both the MBTA and\nthe contract operator. Think about what objectives the MBTA and the operator are likely\nto have and examine the explicit and implicit incentives and penalties built into the\ncontract. If there were the opportunity to change any of the proposed terms in a new\ncontract negotiation, and if you were representing the MBTA, what terms would you\nseek to alter, and in what way? If you were the operator, what terms would you seek to\nalter? Provide appropriate supporting arguments.\n\n2.\nBriefly discuss the difficulties the MBTA is likely to face in monitoring contractor\nperformance and administering the contract.\n\n3.\nProvide a brief assessment of the transitional difficulties the MBTA should expect to face\nif in the future it decided to change the contractor. How significant a problem might this\nbe, in terms of the overall effectiveness of this contracted service? Can you think of any\nstrategies the MBTA might take to minimize this concern?"

      "content": "1.259J Spring 2005\nAssignment #2\nDue: Lecture 19\n\nNOTE: This assignment should be done in new teams of two.\n\nTransit Finance and Budgeting\n\nThis assignment is based on the following documents:\n\n1.\nSilver Line Finance Plan (New Starts submittal);\n\n2.\nThe MBTA budget (extracts);\n\n3.\nThe MBTA Authorizing Legislation - (revised) Chapter 161A of the General Laws of The\nCommonwealth of Massachusetts;\nhttp://www.state.ma.us/legis/laws/mgl/gl-161A-toc.htm\n(or, search for MBTA within the General Laws)\n\n4.\nA summary of the re-write of Chapter 161A.\n\nThese documents collectively provide a good picture of the current state of the MBTA budget, the major\nchange in governance and funding for the MBTA which became effective July 1, 2000, and the recent\nfinance plan for a major capital project.\n\nWith these documents, supplemented by our class discussions, address the following questions:\n\n1. Compare the budgets for FY1991 to FY2005 in terms of income, expenses, debt service,\ncontract assistance and net cost of service. In each category look at the growth of the item as well\nas (where appropriate) the major components. Comment on the most significant changes. How\nwould you describe the changes in the MBTA's financial position over this period?\n\n2. Comment on the Silver Line Finance Plan, especially with respect to the assumptions\nregarding the local sources of capital and operating funds for the years 2010-2015. What\nuncertainties do you see in the projections, and how would you suggest that the MBTA move to\nreduce these uncertainties?\n\n3. Critically assess from the perspectives of the MBTA, the Commonwealth, the communities\nwithin the MBTA district, and the riders of the MBTA, the impacts of the most important\nchanges in financing, funding and governance for the MBTA resulting from the \"forward\nfunding\" legislation and the re-write of Chapter 161A."

Wilson\n1.259J/11.542J/ESD.227J, Fall 2006\nLecture 3\nBackground\n- Prior to mid-1980s, UK local bus industry broadly\ncomparable to US transit industry:\n-\npublic ownership at local level\n-\nheavily subsidized\n-\nslowly declining ridership\n-\nlittle innovation in technology, service, or management\n-\nlittle responsiveness to public needs or concerns\n- Buses played a larger role than in US because of lower\ncar ownership levels and higher operating costs\n\nNigel H.M. Wilson\n1.259J/11.542J/ESD.227J, Fall 2006\nLecture 3\nBus Deregulation Outside London (1986)\nBasic premises behind bus deregulation:\n-\nderegulation would produce a competitive market\n-\ncompetition would substantially reduce costs\n-\na competitive market would improve resource allocation\n-\nthere would be no significant negative side effects\n\nNigel H.M. Wilson\n1.259J/11.542J/ESD.227J, Fall 2006\nLecture 3\nBasic Elements of UK Bus Deregulation\n- Bus markets were divided between commercial and\nnon-commercial, with the following definitions and rules\nfor each:\nCommercial\n-\nDefined as any service that an operator is prepared to offer\nwith the only government support being:\n-- concessionary fares reimbursement\n-- fuel taxes rebate\n\nNigel H.M. Wilson\n1.259J/11.542J/ESD.227J, Fall 2006\nLecture 3\nBasic Elements of UK Bus Deregulation\nCommercial (cont'd)\n-\nServices are registered including the route and timetable, and\nchanges become effective after 6 weeks notice\n-\nFares can be changed with no prior notice\n-\nUnrestricted entry and exit from the market\n-\nKnown as \"Competition In the Market\"\nNon-Commercial\n-\nServices which are not registered as commercial, but needed for\nsocial reasons as identified by local authorities\n-\nAwarded to a private sector operator after a competitive bidding\nprocess for a period of (typically) three years\n\nNigel H.M. Wilson\n1.259J/11.542J/ESD.227J, Fall 2006\nLecture 3\nPublic Transport Authority Reorganization\n- As a transitional strategy, public transport authorities\nwere to be \"corporatized,\" i.e., held at arm's length\nfrom government\n- Could receive subsidy only as a result of success in a\ncompetitive bidding process\n- Eventually they were expected to be privatized\n\nNigel H.M. Wilson\n1.259J/11.542J/ESD.227J, Fall 2006\nLecture 3\nLondon Strategy\n- Deregulation not introduced in London because of\nconcerns about:\n-\nthe effects of free entry on congestion\n-\nrail system effects\n- London Transport (now Transport for London) opted to\nretain control over all planning functions but to move to\nprivatization through competition for incremental\npieces of the London bus network\n- Known as \"Competition For the Market\"\n\nNigel H.M. Wilson\n1.259J/11.542J/ESD.227J, Fall 2006\nLecture 3\nLondon Buses Reorganization\n- Decentralization of London Buses Limited (LBL)\noperations, giving progressively more independence to\nLBL depots\n- Awarding approximately 50% of competitive tenders to\nLBL subsidiaries with the remainder to independent\nprivate bus operators\n- Used competitive pressure to induce LBL subsidiaries\nto restructure labor contracts and management\nstrategy\n- In 1994 all LBL subsidiaries were privatized\n\nNigel H.M. Wilson\n1.259J/11.542J/ESD.227J, Fall 2006\nLecture 3\nResults of Bus Deregulation (1)\n- Operating costs dropped significantly -- by about 50%,\nmost of impact immediately after deregulation\n- Bus kilometers of service increased substantially\nimmediately after deregulation, but now is in modest\ndecline again\n- Fares rose significantly, particularly in major\nmetropolitan areas\n- Relatively little sustained on-the-street competition\n\nNigel H.M. Wilson\n1.259J/11.542J/ESD.227J, Fall 2006\nLecture 3\nResults of Bus Deregulation (2)\n- Great majority of services (80-85%) are operated in\ncommercial regime\n- Subsidies have declined by about 30% since\nderegulation\n- Ridership has declined significantly since deregulation\n- Subsidy per passenger has remained approximately\nconstant despite major decline in subsidy per vehicle\nkilometer\n- Perceptions of service instability\n\nNigel H.M. Wilson\n1.259J/11.542J/ESD.227J, Fall 2006\nLecture 3\nTypical Trajectory Following Deregulation\n-\nIncumbent operator registered most of pre-existing network as\ncommercial\n-\nReduced costs and raised entry cost by converting to minibuses\n-\nEstablishing a foothold for a new entrant via competitive bidding\nproved difficult\n-\nPrice competition proved to be ineffective relative to frequency\ncompetition\n-\nLarge bus holding companies emerged through mergers and\nacquisitions\n-\nThe urban bus market as it developed in the UK proved not to be\ntruly contestable\n-\nLocal bus planning staff largely disappeared\n\nNigel H.M. Wilson\n1.259J/11.542J/ESD.227J, Fall 2006\nLecture 3\nLondon Results\n- Similarities:\n-\nUnit cost reductions in London are close to those attained\noutside London\n-\nService provided has increased by a similar amount to\noutside London\n- Differences:\n-\nRidership in London has experienced modest growth\n-\nSubsidy has declined much more substantially in London\nthan elsewhere\n\nNigel H.M. Wilson\n1.259J/11.542J/ESD.227J, Fall 2006\nLecture 3\nEvolution since Deregulation\nQuality Partnerships (QPs)\n-\nvoluntary partnerships between the operator(s) and the local\nauthority, aimed at improving the quality of bus service on\nspecified corridors\nOperator contribution examples:\n-\nnew buses\n-\nhigher frequencies\n-\ndriver training\n-\nreal-time passenger information\n\nNigel H.M. Wilson\n1.259J/11.542J/ESD.227J, Fall 2006\nLecture 3\nEvolution since Deregulation\nQuality Partnerships (QPs) (cont'd)\nLocal Authority contribution examples:\n-\nbus priority measures\n-\nbus shelters and better transfer facilities\n-\npedestrian access improvements\n-\nreal-time information infrastructure\nQPs have had some success, but it is limited\n\nNigel H.M. Wilson\n1.259J/11.542J/ESD.227J, Fall 2006\nLecture 3\nTransport Acts of 2000 and 2001\nNew powers available to local authorities:\n-\nto provide bus information at a defined level\n-\nto require operators to arrange integrated tickets\n-\nto subsidize operators to provide higher frequency on\ncommercial services\n-\nto define levels of service/vehicle quality in context of QPs and to\nprevent non-compliant operators from serving these corridors\n-\nto move towards a Quality Contract (QC) which is loosely\nmodeled on the London approach\n\nNigel H.M. Wilson\n1.259J/11.542J/ESD.227J, Fall 2006\nLecture 3\nQuality Contracts\nTo implement a QC, the local authority has to be able to\ndemonstrate to central Government some, or all, of the\nfollowing (a sample only):\n-\nQPs will not work to deliver the required improvements\n-\nQC necessary to meet social inclusion objectives\n-\nto provide connecting bus services and intermodal connections\n-\neconomies in rationalizing services\n-\nmonopolistic or excessive profits have resulted\n-\nfares are too high and/or frequencies are too low\n\nNigel H.M. Wilson\n1.259J/11.542J/ESD.227J, Fall 2006\nLecture 3\nEdinburgh Case Study\n-\nEdinburgh regional population is 900,000\n-\nHigh bus ridership -- 200 trips per person per year\n(highest outside London)\n-\nWithin the City of Edinburgh, 97% of services are\ncommercial\n-\nDominant bus operator is Lothian Buses with:\n-\n550 buses\n-\n91.5 million passengers per year\n-\nprofit on turnover of 12%\n\nNigel H.M. Wilson\n1.259J/11.542J/ESD.227J, Fall 2006\nLecture 3\nEdinburgh Case Study\n-\nLothian is still publicly owned, operating as a public\nlimited company\n-\nLimited competition from First Edinburgh (a unit of\nFirst Group), which has concentrated on services to\nthe periphery\n-\nCity of Edinburgh has invested in bus priority routes\n(Greenways) as part of a QP, but it does not directly\ncontrol fares, frequencies, or routes.\n\nNigel H.M. Wilson\n1.259J/11.542J/ESD.227J, Fall 2006\nLecture 3\nEdinburgh Bus Wars (2001/02)\n-\nLothian became more active -- new buses, route\nrationalization, new day tickets, better information\n-\nFirst Edinburgh responded by:\n-\nregistering several routes with same route #s as Lothian\n-\nengaged in active on-the-street competition\n-\nundercut Lothian's day ticket price by 60%\n-\nLothian increased frequencies on contested routes and\nentered onto some of First's longer distance routes\n-\nLothian filed a complaint of anti-competitive behavior/\npredatory tactics with the Office of Fair Trading (OFT)\n-\nFirst withdrew from the battle\n\nNigel H.M. Wilson\n1.259J/11.542J/ESD.227J, Fall 2006\nLecture 3\nCurrent System Characteristics\n-\nan improved bus fleet\n-\nrising patronage\n-\nlow fares\n-\na stable network and good public information\n-\nevening and Sunday service provided largely\ncommercially\n-\nwillingness to serve new trip generators\nThis would make it hard to argue for a QC"

Andrle\nTotal Quality Management in Public Transportation\nA TCRP Digest on the progress of Project F-3, \"Total Quality Management in Public Transportation,\" prepared by MacDorman\n& Associates in association with the American Quality Group and the Spire Group. This is a two-phase project, which presents\nresearch on Total Quality Management (TQM) in the private and public sectors and in the U.S. public transportation industry.\nThis Digest highlights the results of Phase I. The second phase involves the introduction of TQM at four transit systems and the\ndevelopment of training and educational materials on TQM for use by transit systems nationwide.\nINTRODUCTION\nAt the end of the 20th century, changes in\ndemographic patterns and employee expectations,\nshifts in societal demands, increased competition and\nfiscal constraints, and the requirements of adopting\nnew technologies have made many traditional\nbusiness practices obsolete. To meet these broad\nchallenges, growing numbers of American businesses\nhave adopted the principles of Total Quality\nManagement (TQM) to improve the responsiveness\nof their products and services. These adopted\nprinciples have influenced system changes that may\nincrease customer and employee satisfaction, reduce\ncosts, and improve productivity.\nThe transit industry faces many of these same\nchallenges. The principles of TQM appear to hold\npromise as a way to improve transit service, increase\nridership, and fulfill transit's broad social mission.\nHowever, to date, only a few agencies have\nintroduced innovative TQM-based practices.\nWHAT IS TQM?\nTQM is a management philosophy concerned\nwith people and work processes that focuses on\ncustomer satisfaction and improves organizational\nperformance. TQM requires an enterprise to\nsystematically energize, manage, coordinate, and\nimprove all business activities in the interest of\ncustomers.\nTQM requires improvements throughout an\norganization to reduce waste and rework, to lower\ncosts, and to increase productivity. Quality is no\nlonger merely the province of service inspectors, the\ndirector of quality assurance, or the work supervisor.\nIt can be defined, measured, and achieved, but such\nachievement requires that quality is built into all\nwork processes and is understood and applied by all\nemployees. Everyone is responsible for TQM,\nespecially senior management; all employees are\ninvolved in solving problems and improving\nperformance.\nLike\nmany\nso-called\n\"new\nideas,\"\nthe\ncomponents of TQM are not all new. Rather, TQM is\nnew because it embraces and enjoins many existing\nmanagement and organizational philosophies. TQM\nhas its roots in many disciplines, including\neconomics, industrial engineering, social psychology,\nmathematical statistics, and management science.\nSTUDY OBJECTIVES AND SCOPE\nThe objectives of Project F-3 are to identify,\nevaluate, and recommend applications of potentially\nsuccessful methods of implementing TQM in public\ntransportation to increase ridership through improved\ncustomer satisfaction, to increase productivity, and to\nreduce costs.\nThe project is very timely and important because\nit provides the public transportation industry the\nopportunity to\n-\nreview\nthe\nliterature,\nprinciples,\nand\npractices of TQM within and outside the public\ntransportation industry;\n-\nconduct, evaluate, and document pilot TQM\ninitiatives at public transportation agencies;\n-\nprepare informational materials on TQM for\nboard members, managers, and union officials;\nTRANSPORTATION RESEARCH BOARD\nNATIONAL RESEARCH COUNCIL\n\n-\nprepare\nuser-friendly\neducational materials on TQM for\npublic transportation agencies pursuing\nTQM; and\n-\nidentify future research needs\non TQM for public transportation.\nThe results of this project will be\ndocumented in a final report that will\npresent the Phase I research results and\nthe Phase II pilot application results.\nOther products from this project will\ninclude materials that may be used in\nthe\nfuture\nby\nthe\npilot\npublic\ntransportation agencies to continue\ntheir TQM initiatives, and by other\npublic\ntransportation\nagencies\nthroughout the United States that wish\nto pursue TQM.\nHISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE ON\nMANAGEMENT\nThe history of management traces\nback more than two centuries to the\nEnglish economist Adam Smith. Smith,\nand many other economists through the\nearly years of the 20th century, focused\non commodities and not on labor. Early\neconomists\ndid\nnot\nconsider\nmanagement as a central issue in\nbusiness economics.\nJ. B. Say, a French economist and\nearly follower of Adam Smith, stressed\nthe importance of the managerial task\nof making resources more productive.\nAnother Frenchman, the Comte de\nSaint-Simon, foresaw the emergence of\norganizations, the building of social\nstructures within organizations and, in\nparticular, the management of tasks.\nOrganizations and the Management\nof Work\nIt\nwas\nnot\nuntil\nlarge-scale\norganizations began to emerge in the\nearly\n1870s\nthat\nthe\nstructure,\nmanagement,\nand\nbehavior\nof\norganizations became the subject of\ndiscussion, debate, and writings. Henri\nFayol, a French mining engineer who\nheaded a relatively large business (coal\nmine), developed the first rational\napproach to the functional organization.\nFrederick W. Taylor's\nfamous\nstudy of shoveling sand in a steel mill\nfocused on increasing individual labor\nproductivity\nin\norder\nto\nprovide\nemployees with a decent livelihood.\nLater, the husband-and-wife team of\nFrank and Lillian Gilbreth conducted\nstudies of time and motion productivity\nthat were intended to perfect business\nbehavior\nthrough\ntestable\nwork\nmethods.\nIn the early 1920s, Pierre S.\nduPont followed by Alfred P. Sloan,\nthe\nCEO\nof\nGeneral\nMotors\nCorporation, confronted the issue of the\nappropriate degree of centralization or\ndecentralization\nof\nauthority\nfor\ndecisions in large organizations. Sloan\ndeveloped\nand\nimplemented\nthe\norganization\nprinciple\nof\ndecentralization\nand\nsystematic\napproaches to business objectives and\nstrategic planning.\nBehavior in Organizations\nElton Mayo was the director of the\nfamous Hawthorne studies (1927-1932)\nand the founding father of the Human\nRelations movement--the first major\nimpact\nof\nsocial\nscience\non\nmanagement thinking. He emphasized\nthat employees must first be understood\nas people if they are to be understood\nas organization members. His work\nstressed the importance of an adequate\ncommunications system, particularly\nfrom employees to management.\nDouglas McGregor is best known\nfor his discourse of Theory X and\nTheory Y approaches to management.\nTheory X was cast as the traditional\nview of management direction and\ncontrol.\nConversely,\nTheory\nY\naddresses the integration of individual\nand organizational\ngoals. McGregor's studies and writings\nhave been the vehicle of much work on\n\"organizational development.\"\nQuality Management\nThe concern for quality has a long\nand rich history, extending back to\nartisans and craftsmen, when master\ntradesmen inspected the work of\napprentices\nto\nensure\nquality\ncraftsmanship. The introduction of\nmass production at the beginning of the\n20th century was the dawn of a new\nage. The high numbers of poorly made\nand\nnoninterchangeable\nparts,\nbreakdowns, and loss of sales because\nof\nunreliable\nproducts\nforced\ncompanies to make improvements.\nInitially, quality management was\na manufacturing concept intended to\nship nondefective products. It was the\nviewpoint\nof\nG.S.\nRadford\nthat\ninspectors should examine, weigh, and\nmeasure each item prior to its leaving\nthe factory. Inspection, measurement,\nand statistical analysis were the early\nfoundations\nof\nquality\ncontrol.\nMistakes\nwere\nnot\nnecessarily\nprevented, but they were not shipped.\nInspection became an industrial safety\nnet.\nQuality Pioneers\nQuality management advanced,\nlargely, through the writings and\nteachings of so-called Quality Pioneers\nor TQM gurus. The pioneers focused\non quantitative techniques and methods\nto control the quality of manufactured\nproducts. From its beginnings at Bell\nLaboratories,\nTQM\nevolved\nand\ndeveloped while the most renowned\npioneers created and promoted the\nphilosophy. Five of the more notable\nproponents and leaders of TQM are\nbriefly introduced below:\nThese Digests are issued in the interest of providing an early awareness of the research results emanating from projects in the\nTCRP. By making these results known as they are developed, it is hoped that the potential users of the research findings will be\nencouraged toward their early implementation Persons wanting to pursue the project subject matter in greater depth may do so\nthrough contact with the Cooperative Research Programs Staff, Transportation Research Board, 2101 Constitution Ave., N.W.,\nWashington, DC 20418\n\n-\nW. Edwards Deming is best\nknown for his \"Fourteen Points,\" a\nbroad set of simple but profound\nquality principles; the \"Seven Deadly\nDiseases,\" common obstacles to quality\nimprovement; and the \"Plan, Do Check,\nAct (PDCA) cycle,\" a systematic\napproach to problem solving. These\nconcepts are well documented in his\nwritings.\n-\nJoseph Juran moved quality\ncontrol forward to the idea of quality\nassurance and introduced the concept\nof quality as a means for cost control.\nDr. Juran wrote the Quality Control\nHandbook, which has served as the\nbible in this field. In this book, he\narticulated that quality is not an\nexpense\nbut\nan\ninvestment\nin\nprofitability.\nLike\nDeming,\nJuran\nhelped bring TQM to Japan and later to\nthe United States.\n-\nKaoru\nIshikawa\nled\nthe\nmovement in Japan to adapt the\nteachings of the American quality\nexperts and synthesized these concepts\ninto his Company Wide Quality Control\n(CWQC), successfully championing the\nintegration of quality methods into\nJapanese engineering and management\neducation curricula. These methods\nhave been used successfully for several\ndecades, and are an integral part of the\nJapanese industrial culture.\n-\nArmand Feigenbaum advocated\nexpanding\nquality\ncontrol\nbeyond\ninspectors to every employee and\nvendor. He believed that quality was\ntoo central to be delegated to an\ninspection corps because this was too\nlimited an approach. Rather, a total\nquality\napproach\nrequires\nthe\nparticipation of all employees in the\norganization as well as vendors that\nsupply the organization.\n-\nPhilip B. Crosby espoused \"zero\ndefects\" and the principle that quality is\nthe\nconformance\nto\nrequirements.\nWhile initially real, the costs of quality\ndisappear\nas\nthe\nvery\nreal\nand\nmeasurable benefits of quality emerge.\nThe rising interest in TQM has\nmade publishing and consulting in\nquality management a growth industry.\nAppendix A contains a bibliography\nand reference guide, which includes\nmany of the more significant books and\narticles on TQM. The bibliography is\norganized into nine categories to assist\npublic transportation managers and\nothers interested in learning about\nTQM:\ngeneral,\nleadership\nand\norganizational culture, measurement\nand\nbenchmarking,\nprocess\nmanagement,\ntraining\nand\ntools,\nemployee empowerment and teams,\nlabor, customer service, and case\nstudies. A glossary of terms frequently\nused in the TQM literature and by its\npractitioners is presented in Appendix\nB.\nPrinciples Espoused by Experts\nWhile the various experts differ\nwith each other in specific areas, a\nreview of TQM principles espoused by\nexperts identified the following areas of\ngeneral agreement:\n- TQM is a fundamental change in how\nmost enterprises manage their business.\nThe change is difficult and takes time.\n- Management must lead the total\nquality initiative.\n- All employees must be involved in\ntotal quality management.\n- Continuous quality improvement is a\nbusiness imperative.\n- Quality control and improvement\napply throughout the organization.\n- Ongoing education and training are\nessential for all employees.\n- Quality requires an environment of\nteamwork, respect for the individual, trust,\nand professional growth.\n- Quality has a double benefit. It\nincreases customer satisfaction and\nrevenue by improving the quality of\nproducts and services; it reduces costs by\nimproving the quality of processes.\nRegardless of the differences and\nsimilarities among the TQM gurus,\norganizations considering the pursuit of\nTQM need not adopt the philosophy of\na single expert nor should they rethink\nthe entire field and build their own\nphilosophy\nfrom\nthe\nground\nup.\nClearly, there is a middle ground,\nwhere each organization can draw on\nthe perspectives of different TQM\nproponents and tailor their initiative to\nbest serve the needs and priorities of\ntheir customers and their organization.\nTQM in Japan\nIt is commonly believed that TQM\nis a Japanese management philosophy.\nIt was, however, created by Americans,\nfollowing World War I, and adopted by\nthe Japanese after World War II, as\nthey rebuilt their industries. TQM has\nflourished in Japan since the early\n1950s,\nevolving\nand\nchanging\nsomewhat over time.\nDeming went to Japan in 1950, at\nthe request of the U.S. government,\nwhere the newly formed Japanese\nUnion of Scientists and Engineers\n(JUSE) asked him to teach statistical\nquality control to managers of all\nindustries.\nHe\ndeclined\nroyalties\noffered by JUSE for the publication of\nhis lecture notes and in gratitude, JUSE\nnamed a newly announced prize for\nquality after him. Although apparently\nslow to take hold, the Deming Prize is\nnow a distinguished and prestigious\naccomplishment.\nAmong\nother\nbenefits, it is credited with stimulating\nthe race for quality in Japan, as well as\nthe transfer of quality methods and\ntechnology.\nIt was Japan's past reputation for\npoor product quality and the need to\ncompete in the post-World War II\nworld marketplace that drove the\nJapanese to implement total quality\nmanagement concepts as the heart of\ntheir business planning. Since the\n1970s, Japan has been recognized as\nthe world leader for product and service\nquality. Earlier than any other country,\nJapanese\ncompanies\nused\nthe\nknowledge\n\nfrom Deming and Juran's teaching to\nbuild a quality revolution.\nTQM in the United States\nWorld War II created a demand\nfor\nproducts\nand\nheightened\nthe\nconcern for product quality worldwide.\nOver time, new dimensions were added\nto quality management, such as cost\nreductions from less rework, improved\nwork processes to avoid defects, and\nmeeting customer requirements to keep\nand increase market share.\nThe\nincreased\nnumber\nof\ninspectors and quality engineers in the\nUnited States resulted in the formation\nof an academic and professional society\nto further spread quality techniques and\ntechnology. Formally established in\n1945, this group was originally called\nthe Society for Quality Engineers;\ntoday it is called the American Society\nof Quality Control (ASQC). Its efforts\nhave\nhelped\nlegitimize\nquality\nmanagement as an integral element of\nbusiness and industry throughout the\nUnited States and worldwide. In the\npast\nyears,\nother\nbusiness\nassociations and professional societies\nthat support quality have been formed.\nIt has only been since the late\n1970s that TQM has come back to the\nUnited States as a means to redirect\nmanagement practices and improve\nperformance.\nWith\nthe\nincreasing\nconcern for competition and global\nmarkets,\nTQM\nhas\nmoved\nfrom\nmanufacturing, as its exclusive domain,\nto many sectors of U.S. business and\nindustry including services, research\nand development, and health care.\nMore recently, the public sector has\nadopted TQM as the basis for improved\nperformance.\nTQM in the Private Sector\nIn the past several years, there has\nbeen a burgeoning interest in TQM\nthroughout the private sector in the\nUnited\nStates.\nNew\nexperts\nand\nrecognized consulting firms emerge\neach\nyear to support clients in their pursuit\nof excellence and quality performance.\nAwards\nhave\nbeen\ndeveloped\nto\nrecognize\norganizations\nthat\nhave\nachieved or are pursuing quality\nperformance.\n- National Awards for Quality.\nThe Malcolm Baldrige National\nQuality Award (Baldrige Award) is\nthe most renowned award for quality\nin the United States. This award,\nestablished in 1987 by the Act of\nCongress (the Malcolm Baldrige\nNational Quality Improvement Act\nof 1987, Public Law 100-107), is\ndesigned to recognize companies\nthat have successfully implemented\ntotal quality management systems.\nThe award is managed by the U.S.\nDepartment of Commerce's National\nInstitute\nof\nStandards\nand\nTechnology\n(NIST)\nand\nis\nadministered\nby\nthe\nASQC.\nFollowing a rigorous examination\nprocess, the award is presented\nannually to a maximum of six\ncompanies,\nrepresenting\nmanufacturing, service, and small\nbusiness.\n- The\nUnited\nStates\nSenate\nProductivity Award. This national\naward also recognizes organizations\nfor\nimprovements\nin\nbusiness\nefficiency and productivity. It is\npresented yearly to companies that\ndemonstrate increases in annual\nproductivity or make a contribution\nto a community's employment. Each\nU.S. senator may present one\nproductivity award per year. There\nare no set criteria that a company\nmust meet in order to win.\n- State and Local Awards for\nQuality. The success of the Baldrige\nAward has led to the creation of\nsimilar awards for quality at the\nstate and local levels. While awards\nfor quality are predominantly made\nto companies in the private sector,\nhalf of the states currently offering\nawards have added a category for\nnonprofit\nor\ngovernment\norganizations.\nSimilar\nto\nthe\nBaldrige Award, the intent of these\nawards is to both recognize and\nencourage outstanding performance\nand excellence in business and\ngovernment.\nTQM in the Public Sector\nTotal quality management is now\nbeing widely adopted by federal, state,\nand local governments. The primary\ncatalyst for quality improvement in the\npublic sector has been budget pressure,\ncaused by rising costs and dwindling\ntax revenues.\n- The Federal Government. TQM\nin the federal government grew out\nof productivity programs that started\nat the Department of Defense in the\nearly 1970s. As a result of DOD's\nearly commitment to this effort, it\nremains\none\nof\nthe\nstrongest\nproponents and provides one of the\nbest examples of TQM in the federal\ngovernment.\nIn 1986, President Reagan signed\nan executive order to implement a\ngovernment-wide\nproductivity\ninitiative under the direction of the\nOffice of Management and Budget.\nAfter\nconsultation\nwith\nprivate\nsector leaders, this productivity\neffort evolved into total quality\nmanagement initiatives.\nThe Federal Quality Institute\n(FQI) was created by the Office of\nManagement and Budget, in 1988,\nto\ninform\nand\nconsult\nwith\ngovernment agencies involved in\nTQM programs. It was also charged\nwith\nadministration\nof\nthe\nPresident's Award for Quality and\nProductivity\nand\nthe\nQuality\nImprovement\nPrototype\nAward\n(QIP) established in 1988.\nEarly\nin\nhis\nadministration,\nPresident Clinton launched a 6\nmonth\nNational\nPerformance\nReview of all federal agencies,\nheaded by Vice President Gore. The\nPresident announced: \"Our goal is to\nmake the entire federal government\nboth less expensive and more\nefficient, and to change the culture\nof our national bureaucracy away\nfrom complacency and entitlement\ntoward initiative and empowerment.\nWe\n\nintend to redesign, to reinvent, to\nreinvigorate\nthe\nentire\nnational\ngovernment.\"\nThe\nClinton\nadministration's\ncommitment\nto\nquality is further evidenced in Vice\nPresident Gore's recently published\nThe Gore Report on Reinventing\nGovernment:\nCreating\na\nGovernment that Works Better and\nCosts Less.\n-\nState and Local\nGovernment. Many states now\nhave quality awards patterned after\nthe private sector Baldrige Award.\nMore recently, some states have\nintroduced quality programs aimed\nat rewarding or improving the\nperformance\nof\ngovernment\nagencies. As with the federal\ngovernment, budget pressure and\nconstituents' demands for improved\nperformance in the public sector\nhave provided an impetus for TQM\nin state and local government.\nSeveral notable examples of\nstates and local communities that are\npursing and recognizing TQM in the\npublic\nsector\ncurrently\ninclude\nArkansas,\nFlorida,\nKansas,\nMinnesota, and Oregon and the\ncities of Madison, Wisconsin and\nPortland, Oregon.\nProblems with TQM in the Public\nSector\nDespite many similarities, the\npublic sector differs significantly from\nthe private sector. Implementers of\nTQM in government face a number of\nadditional hurdles not found in the\nprivate companies. These include a lack\nof market incentives, a short-term\nperspective caused by frequent political\nchangeovers, a highly centralized and\nlayered structure, a separation of\npowers that requires negotiation and\nconsensus building, conflicting needs\nbetween various customer groups, and\nan emphasis on due process over\nefficiency.1\nIn short, the political process is\nmore complicated and contentious than\nsimilar processes in the private sector,\nand requires careful navigation. Public\nsector organizations pursuing TQM\nmust\nremain sensitive to each of these\ndifferences to be effective.\nTQM IN THE PUBLIC\nTRANSPORTATION INDUSTRY\nThe public transportation industry\nhas become interested and involved in\nTQM only in the past several years. In\na\nconfidential\nSurvey\nfor\nChief\nExecutive\nOfficers:\nTotal\nQuality\nManagement in Public Transportation\n-conducted in June 1993 as part of this\nproject--about 85 percent of the 172\nrespondents indicated they had heard of\nor knew about TQM.\nOne\nhundred\nthree\nChief\nExecutive Officers (CEOs) or 60\npercent of the respondents said that\ntheir organizations were involved in\nTQM or other quality initiatives. Of the\n103 transit organizations, only 17 (27\npercent) indicated they started their\nefforts more than 3 years ago. Figures 1\nand 2 illustrate the focus of these\ninitiatives. It is probable that the results\nof this survey overstate national public\ntransportation\nindustry\ninvolvement\nwith TQM, since less than 30 percent\nof the CEOs (172 out of 590)\nresponded to the survey. (The survey\ninstrument and the results are presented\nin the Interim and Final reports for this\nproject.)\nConcern for Performance and\nCustomers\nConcern for performance and\ninterest in customers are not new to the\npublic transportation industry. As the\noperators of private businesses and\nlater\npublic\nservices,\npublic\ntransportation managers have sought to\nmaximize ridership and revenues by\nproviding clean, safe, and reliable\nservice,\nwhile\ncarefully\nmanaging\ncosts.\n- Concern for Productivity. Since\nthe mid 1970s, public transportation\nagencies,\nlocal\nofficials,\nstate\ngovernments,\nand\nthe\nfederal\ngovernment\nhave\ndisplayed\nheightened\ninterest\nin\ntransit\nperformance. This interest is the\nproduct of several\neconomic, social, and political\nforces: escalating industry costs;\ngreater\ncompetition\nfor\nlimited\npublic funds; fiscal conservatism at\nthe local, state, and national levels;\ncontinuing demand for clean, safe,\non-time,\naffordable\npublic\ntransportation\nservices;\nand\nincreasing interest in accountability\nof public services.\nNumerous\nfactors\ninfluence\npublic transportation performance.\nThese factors may be divided into\ntwo\ncategories--controllable\nand\nnoncontrollable. Controllable factors\nare those influenced by the decisions\nand\nactions\nof\nthe\npublic\ntransportation governing board, its\nexecutives,\nmanagers,\nand\nemployees. Uncontrollable factors\ninclude both the environmental and\neconomic conditions in which public\ntransportation\nagencies\noperate.\nTQM focuses on the controllable\nfactors.\n-\nConcern for People.\nA\nreport prepared by the American\nPublic Transit Association, Transit\n2000 Task Force stated \"...we are\nbound by a traditional preoccupation\nwith accommodating vehicles and\ninattention\nto\naccommodating\npeople....Public\ntransportation\nis\ndominated by its human resource\nand human service character. The\nperformance and success of public\ntransit hinges on how human factors\nare\nmanaged.\nThere\nare\ntwo\ndimensions of concern--riders and\nwork force....\"\n-\nIndustry Leadership:\nPerspectives and Attitudes. One of\nthe most interesting findings of the\nrecent Survey of Chief Executive\nOfficers, conducted in this project,\nwas the generally high opinion held\nby CEOs of their organization's\npublic image and their belief that\nthings are going well. (See Figures 3\nand 4.) While this positive outlook\nis praiseworthy, opinion polls show\nthat transit has only an average\npublic image as judged by a national\nconsumer survey conducted by The\nConference Board in 1990. From a\nbusiness perspective, things are not\ngoing particularly well\n\nFigure 1. Responses to: Which organizational functions are involved in the quality initiatives?\nFigure 2. Responses to: What types of performances are the quality initiatives to improve?\n\nFigure 3. Responses to: Our public image is very positive.\nFigure 4. Responses to: Thins in our organization seem to be going well.\n\nin\nthe\nU.S.\ntransit\nindustry.\nAccording to the 1990 Nationwide\nPersonal Transportation Survey, the\nindustry, as a whole, continues to\nlose travel market share even in the\nmore traditional transit arenas that\ninclude female consumers and low\nincome residents in urbanized areas.\nProfile of Public Transportation\nQuality Initiatives\nTransit systems in the United\nStates have a well-established interest\nin improving performance--reducing\ncosts to increase efficiency, improving\nvehicle maintenance to increase service\nreliability, modifying bus schedules to\nincrease\non-time\nperformance,\nimproving\nmarketing\nand\ncommunications to increase customer\nsatisfaction.\nA\nnumber\nof\nU.S.\npublic\ntransportation\nagencies\nmade\na\ncommitment to TQM in the late 1980s.\nThese systems include Madison Metro\nin Madison, Wisconsin; Port Authority\nof Allegheny County in Pittsburgh,\nPennsylvania;\nand\nRide-On\nin\nMontgomery County, Maryland. The\nefforts of these transit agencies to\ninitiate TQM are presented as case\nstudies in the Interim and Final Reports\nfor this project.\nIn\nSeptember\n1993,\nthe\nresearchers for this project sent a\nSurvey of Quality Initiatives and Efforts\nof Public Transportation Organizations\nto 103 public transit organizations. The\norganizations surveyed were those that\nresponded to the initial Survey for Chief\nExecutive Officers and stated that their\ntransit system had \"embarked on TQM\nor other quality initiatives.\" The\nprimary objective of the survey was to\nobtain a greater appreciation for the\nnature and extent of transit industry\ninvolvement in TQM and related\nformal\nquality\ninitiatives.\nThe\nresponses provide insight regarding the\ncurrent status of the quality movement\nin the U.S. transit industry.\nThe overall conclusion of this\nsecond survey is that, while TQM is\nnew to the U.S. transit industry, many\ntransit systems are interested in TQM\nand have begun to implement quality\nprograms.\nTransit\nsystems\nare\ninterested in improved performance and\nin increased customer satisfaction,\nparticularly for external customers.\nInformation is being gathered by many\npublic\ntransportation\norganizations\nthrough surveys to determine how they\ncan improve performance and increase\nquality.\nThe survey results, which are\npresented in more detail in the Interim\nReport, indicate that, while transit\nsystem CEOs are involved in providing\nvision\nand\noversight\nfor\nquality\nprograms, most other foundations for\nTQM are not yet in place. For example:\n- Transit governing boards are not\nactively involved in quality; neither\nare union leaders. Policy statements\non quality have not been formulated\nand communicated. (See Figures 5\nand 6.)\n- Quality coordinators or facilitators\nhave generally not been designated\nor hired by transit systems to\nmanage and support quality.\n- Transit employees are not yet\nsufficiently trained in tools and\ntechniques for problem solving and\nconflict resolution. Consequently,\nemployee participation in quality\nimprovement is largely unstructured,\nthrough\nindividual\nideas\nand\nsuggestions rather than through\nwell-trained functional and cross-\nfunctional teams that meet regularly.\n(See Figures 7 and 8.)\n- Transit employees are infrequently\nrewarded\nthrough\nformal\nrecognition\nand\nreward\nfor\ncontributing to quality improvement.\n- The quality programs of the\nsurvey respondents do not appear to\nbe very rigorous. Measurement of\nresults is not integral to the pursuit\nof\nimprovements,\nnor\nis\nbenchmarking\nto emulate excellent performance by\nother organizations. (See Figures 9\nand 10.)\nFormalizing\nTQM\nrequires\ncommitment,\ntime,\neffort,\nand\nresources. It appears it will be some\ntime yet before significant nationwide\nimprovements to performance and\ncustomer satisfaction will be realized\nbased on the current status of TQM in\nthe U.S. transit industry.\nTQM\nPRINCIPLES\nFOR\nTHE\nPUBLIC TRANSPORTATION\nINDUSTRY\nThis\nsection\ndefines\nseven\nfundamental principles that provide\nguidance for TQM implementation and\nconcludes with lessons of TQM success\nand failure. TQM is a comprehensive,\nall-encompassing\napproach\nto\nmanagement and requires a systematic\napproach to long-term growth. These\nprinciples\nshould\nnot\nbe\nviewed\nindependently, but as vital components\nof a total quality plan.\nPrinciple 1: Put Customers First\n\"Putting customers first\" is the\nbasis for all quality management. TQM\nrequires organizations to adopt the\nbelief that service and product quality\nshould meet--if not exceed--customers'\nexpectations. All people and processes\nof an organization should be directed to\nmeet this goal.\nThe\nsuccess\nof\npublic\ntransportation depends on customer\nsatisfaction--attracting and retaining\ncustomers to use or support its services.\nIndeed, if there are no customers, there\nis no need for public transportation\nservices. Similar to many private sector\nservices, public transportation has two\ntypes of customers: (1) consumers--the\npeople who ride the service and (2)\nstockholders--the general public who\nare tax-paying investors in the service.\nBy understanding and meeting\ncustomer expectations for service and\n\nFigure 5.

Responses to: Does the organization measure or monitor the results of initiatives?\nFigure 10. Responses to: Does the organization utilize benchmarking in quality initiatives?\n\nproduct\nquality,\nan\norganization\nimproves its performance. The effects\nof successfully satisfying customers are\nrealized in at least three areas for transit\nsystems:\n- Ridership Stability. By satisfying\nand delighting customers, customer\nloyalty and ridership will increase. It\nis less expensive to keep existing\ncustomers than to attract new ones.\n- New Riders. Transit systems can\nalso attract new customers, resulting\nin increased market share.\n- Cost Reduction. By directing\nprocesses\nand\npeople\ntoward\nmeeting\ncustomer\nexpectations,\noperational costs can be lowered and\nwaste eliminated because certain\nextraneous\nactivities,\nsuch\nas\nbureaucratic policies and paperwork,\nthat are not essential to customers\ncan be stopped.\nOrganizations should strive to\nmeet customer expectations in all work\nfunctions. Every possible interaction\nbetween the customer and the transit\nsystem should be flawless and pleasant.\nUsing the service should be easy. It\nshould be accomplished in a timely\nmanner and pleasant environment, with\nfront-line\nemployees\nwho\nare\nknowledgeable\nand\nhelpful.\nThis\nrequires systems and processes behind\nthe scenes that enable employees to\noffer courteous, efficient, and effective\nservice.\nKnowing the Customer. Public\ntransportation agencies should use\nmarket research to determine customer\nexpectations and perceptions. They\nmust first define their customers--who\nare they, why do they use or not use the\nservice,\nand\nwhat\ncompetitive\nalternatives do they have. Next, transit\nagencies should determine what drives\ncustomer\nsatisfaction--what\nare\ncustomers' priorities, and how satisfied\nare they with the transit services.\nThere are numerous methods to\nobtain vital information on customer\npriorities\nfrom\nsample\ngroups.\nResearchers\nuse\nfocus\ngroups,\ninterviews,\nmail surveys, and telephone surveys to\nsolicit\ninformation\non\ncustomer\nexpectations, their current levels of\nsatisfaction, and factors that may\ninfluence people to use or not use\ntransit services. Market research should\nbe conducted so that transit directors\nand managers base their decisions\nregarding customer priorities on facts,\nrather than assumptions.\nFront-line employees (i.e., vehicle\noperators,\ntelephone\ninformation\npersonnel, ticket agents) are also\nimportant resources for understanding\ncustomer expectations. Through regular\ncontact\nwith\ncustomers,\nfront-line\nemployees are frequently better able to\njudge customers' reactions to service\nthan senior management or third-party\nmarket\nresearchers.\nTo\nuse\nthis\ninformation, organizations must open\ntheir channels of communication so\nthat front-line employees are able to\ncommunicate\neffectively\nwith\nmanagers who will organize follow-up\naction.\nResponding to Customer\nExpectations.\nTranslating\nmarket\nresearch results and employee feedback\nabout customers' expectations into\nactionable procedures is a challenge for\nevery organization. There is no set\nmethod that an organization can follow.\nEvery organization must adjust its own\nculture,\nsystems,\nand\nplans\nto\nsuccessfully \"put customers first.\"\nOrganizations must learn to make\nmeeting\nand\nexceeding\ncustomer\nexpectations a priority in both their\nday-to-day activities and in their long\nterm-planning.\nThis\nrequires\ndeveloping\ncustomer-focused\noperational processes and, at a strategic\nlevel, committing the resources that\nposition customers, and meeting their\nexpectations, as an asset to the\norganization's financial well-being.\nThe following are noteworthy\nexamples of work that is currently\nbeing\nperformed\nby\nU.S.\ntransit\nsystems to research customer priorities:\n- A\nlarge\npublic\ntransportation\nsystem in the western United States\nhas\nconducted surveys of area residents\nfor about 5 years to identify the\ndeterminants\nof\ncustomer\nsatisfaction. About 2,500 annual\nriders and nonriders are asked to rate\ntheir degree of satisfaction with, and\nimportance\nof,\npublic\ntransportation\nservice\nattributes.\nThis process has identified the areas\nof performance most in need of\nimprovement based on customer\npriorities and satisfaction levels\nassociated with the 26 attributes.\nIn 1991, the survey revealed that\ncustomers were most satisfied with\nthe safe operation of the buses, the\ndaytime safety of waiting for buses,\nthe politeness of drivers, and the\nclarity of the timetables. Customers\nrated\non-time\nperformance,\nthe\nnighttime safety of waiting for and\nriding buses, and the mechanical\nreliability of the buses as the most\nimportant service attributes. The\ngreatest gaps between the ratings of\ncustomer\nexpectations\nand\nperceptions were night-time safety,\non-time\nperformance,\nheadways\nbetween buses, and travel time to\nwork.\nThese\nperformance\ngaps\nprovide opportunities to improve\nservice and satisfy customers.\n- Another\npublic\ntransportation\norganization reported that operator\nbehavior makes a difference in the\nwillingness\nof\ncurrent\nand\nprospective customers to use public\ntransportation services. The survey\nfound, for example, that respondents\nwould be encouraged to use public\ntransportation when the driver is\nhelpful, pleasant, and courteous.\nSpecifically, it noted that passengers\nappreciate drivers who wait for\npassengers to be seated before\ndriving off from a stop and who help\nthose with difficulty boarding.\nThese and other similar efforts are\non the cutting edge of performance\nimprovement\nbecause\nthey\ngather\nrelevant and much needed customer-\ndriven information to improve the\nquality\nof\npublic\ntransportation\nservices.\n\nPrinciple 2: Manage and Improve\nProcesses\nBy\nimproving\noperations--how\nwork\nactivities\nare\nperformed-\norganizations can raise the quality of\ntheir services, products, and delivery;\nincrease\nproductivity;\nimprove\noperational efficiency; and eliminate\nwaste.\nProcess Management Creates\nCustomer Satisfaction. A widely\naccepted\nTQM\napproach\nto\nunderstanding\nand\nimproving\noperations is process management.\nProcess\nmanagement\nrequires\nunderstanding how work is done, how\noutput or results are achieved, and how\nvalue is provided to customers. It\nprovides a comprehensive, integrated\nmethod of analyzing operations and\nfocusing\nall\nwork\nactivities\non\nsatisfying customers.\nAll\nemployees\nin\na\npublic\ntransportation system have customers\nand suppliers, either inside or outside\nthe\norganization.\nIndividuals\nand\ngroups (i.e., suppliers) perform work\nand pass on the results or information\nto others (i.e., their customers) within\nor outside the organization. Everyone\nuses the output of their suppliers and\nprovides input to their customers.\nThroughout all work processes--to the\ndelivery of service, the goal of public\ntransportation employees is to satisfy\nall customers and to add value to\nprocesses.\nThis\nrequires\nbuilding\nquality into work processes to avoid\ndefects and improve performance.\nCross-Functional Approach and\nContinuous\nImprovement.\nPublic\ntransportation agencies are almost\nalways organized into specialty areas\nsuch\nas\nscheduling,\noperations,\nmaintenance, finance, human resources,\nand procurement. This arrangement,\ncalled\nfunctional\norganization,\norganizes employees into work groups\nrequiring similar job knowledge and\nskills. Unfortunately, the results of\nfunctional work efforts alone are rarely\nresponsible for satisfying or exceeding\ncustomer expectations.\nIn the planning and development\nof processes, it is essential that\nmembers of all stages and subprocesses\nbe involved. This is called a cross-\nfunctional approach. Through a cross-\nfunctional\napproach,\npublic\ntransportation employees can view their\nresponsibilities in the chain of events\nthat leads to service delivery while\ndeveloping an understanding of the\nneeds and demands of their colleagues.\nProcesses\nare\nthen\ncreated\nor\nreorganized\nto\nmeet\ncustomer\nexpectations,\nrather\nthan\nhaving\nemployees complete tasks in their own\nareas, with little regard for the end\nresults.\nResearch shows that significant\nimprovements\nin\norganizational\nperformance usually involve the efforts\nof more than one functional activity or\ngroup.\nIn\ncross-functional\ngroups,\nemployees learn the following:\n- the many functions within the\norganization\nand\nhow\nthey\ncontribute to the end result;\n- the relationship among functions\nand how each affects customer\nsatisfaction;\n- the many responsibilities of others\nwithin the organization, including\ntime\ndemands,\npressures,\nand\npotential failure points; and\n- important information that other\ndepartments and employees may\nknow\nregarding\ncustomer\nsatisfaction and how it may best be\nachieved.\nThe\ndevelopment\nand\nimplementation of process management\nwithin the context of cross-functional\ngroups allows for and encourages\nproblem prevention and continuous\nimprovement at every stage of transit\nservice delivery. A shift is made from\nusing traditional quality inspection of\nend\nresults\nto\nrecognizing\nand\npreventing problems before the product\nor service is delivered.\nPrinciple 3: Manage by Fact\nTQM is a management philosophy\nthat requires the use of facts and data,\nsuch as market research and process\ndocumentation, to achieve customer\nsatisfaction and improve operational\nperformance. As many TQM\nproponents say, \"If you can't measure\nit, you can't manage it. If you can't\nmanage it, you can't improve it.\"\nMeasures serve the dual role of\n(1) setting\nthe\ndirection\nfor\noperational and strategic planning and\n(2) providing feedback on whether\norganizational goals and objectives are\nbeing achieved.\nTQM has simultaneous goals of\ncustomer satisfaction and improved\noperations.\nConsequently,\nmeasures\ncritical\nfor\nTQM\nare\nefficiency,\neffectiveness, and quality.\n- Efficiency considers the resources\n(e.g.,\nlabor,\ncapital,\noverhead,\nmaterials) necessary to produce\noutput coupled with the quantity,\ncost, and rate of productivity.\nEfficiency measures are usually\ndeveloped by dividing the quantity\nof output by the cost or quantity of\nresource input. Increases in cost,\nbecause of inflationary factors, must\nbe\nconsidered\nwhen\nassessing\nefficiency.\n- Effectiveness is the quantity of\nproducts or services consumed per\nunit cost or resource to produce\nthem at a given price and quality.\nEffectiveness dimensions include\nthe consumption of services or\nproducts that are influenced by\nquality.\n- Quality plays a major role in both\nefficiency and effectiveness because\nof the multiplicity of dimensions it\nadds to improving and achieving\ncustomer\nsatisfaction\nand\nby\neliminating\nwaste,\nrework,\nand\ndefects.\nCritical\ndimensions\nof\nquality include accuracy, reliability,\nsecurity, responsiveness, courtesy,\ncompetence, timeliness, appearance,\ninformation, communication, and\naccessibility or ease of use.\nCriteria for and Uses of\nMeasures.\nThe\nfollowing\ncriteria\nshould\nbe\nused\nto\nsuccessfully\nimplement measures and ensure their\nacceptance by employees.\n\nOtherwise,\nmeasurement\nwill\nbe\nviewed as \"extra work\" rather than as\nan enhancement to the TQM effort.\nGood measures are\n- Valid. Data are sampled by\nmethods that are unquestionably\ncredible by all parties and are\nunaffected\nby\nartificial\nmanipulation.\n- Complete. Measures adequately\ngauge the activity rather than only\nsome aspect of the activity.\n- Manageable. Measures provide\nsufficient information on which to\nbase management decisions.\n- Timely. Data and information\nshould be collected and reported\nsoon after the processes' actual\noccurrence.\n- Visible. Measures should be\nopenly tracked by those who\nmanage them.\n- Inexpensive. Measures make use\nof data easily obtained or already\ncollected for some other purpose.\n- Interpretable. Measures should\nbe easy to understand and readily\ncomparable to other time periods or\norganizations.\n- Benchmarked.\nComparable\nmeasures from other organizations\nare available and current.\n- Motivational. Measures should\ngenerate\nthe\ndesired\nbalance\nbetween competitive spirit and\ncollaborative teamwork.\nBenchmarking. Benchmarking is\na measurement-based method used in\nTQM\nto\nmake\noperational\nimprovements. It is defined as a\nprocess\nof\nmeasuring\nproducts,\nservices, and practices against those of\ncompetitors\nand\n\"best-in-class\"\norganizations, for the purpose of\nimprovement. Benchmarking is an\napproach that goes outside of one's\norganization\nto\nobserve\nhow\noutstanding organizations accomplish\ncertain activities.\nThere are two approaches to\nbenchmarking:\n- Competitive benchmarking\nmeasures\norganizational\nperformance\nagainst\ncompeting\norganizations.\nCompetitive\nbenchmarking tends to concentrate\non the relative performance of\ncompetitors using a select set of\nindustry measures.\n- Process benchmarking identifies\nand measures the best, i.e., world-\nclass, practice for conducting a\nparticular business process. Once\nthe best practice is identified,\nmeasured, and understood, it may be\nadapted\nand\nimproved\nfor\napplication to another organization.\nFor example, L.L. Bean is often\nbenchmarked by companies in other\nindustries\nfor\nits\nwarehousing\ncapabilities.\nThere are a number of benefits to\nbenchmarking that can help improve\noperations. For example, benchmarking\nbuilds organizational awareness of the\nbest practices in a particular process;\nidentifies the measure of excellence for\na targeted process; enhances goal-\nsetting and performance assessment;\nand challenges \"business as usual\" or\n\"if it ain't broke, don't fix it\" attitudes.\nInformation Technology. The\nincreasing availability of sophisticated\ninformation technology has a profound\neffect on business processes. Satellites,\ncellular\ntelephones,\nmodems,\nteleconferencing, and facsimiles are\nexamples of recent improvements in\ninformation\ntechnology.\nAvailable\ninformation\ntechnology\nfor\npublic\ntransportation\nincludes\nautomatic\npassenger counters, automatic vehicle\nlocation\nsystems,\nand\npassenger\ninformation systems. Using information\ntechnology to support the real-time\nactivities of front-line employees and\ncustomers should be of primary interest\nto public transportation agencies.\nAn important challenge to public\ntransportation is to identify where\nexisting\nand\nnear-developed\ninformation technology can improve\nperformance.\nPublic transportation agencies must\nlearn to process real-time information\nto\nefficiently\nmake\ndecisions\nto\nimprove\ncustomer\nsatisfaction.\nBecoming\nmanagers\nof\n\"public\nmobility\" instead of managers of public\ntransportation will, to a large extent,\nrely on developments in information\ntechnology.\nPublic\ntransportation\nagencies\nneed to (1)\nimport\ninformation\nefficiently; (2) move information to the\nright place in the organization where it\ncan be analyzed, digested, and acted\nupon; (3) make the necessary internal\ntransformations to take account of new\ninformation; and (4)\nget\nfeedback\non the impacts of its new responses.\nPrinciple 4: Cultivate Organizational\nLearning\nWithout learning, organizations\nand their members repeat old behavior\nand\npractices.\nSolving\nproblems,\nchanging\nprocedures\nto\nmeet\ncustomers'\nchanging\nneeds,\nunderstanding\nthe\nimportance\nof\nsatisfying customers, and designing or\nreengineering processes all require\nlearning that work can be performed in\ndifferent, better ways.\nCreating a learning environment\nrequires\ncommitment\nfrom\nsenior\nmanagement.\nSenior\nmanagement\nshould set the example by continuing to\nlearn themselves, involving others in\nthe learning process, and creating\npolicies and recognition programs that\nencourage employees to develop new\nideas.\nAll\nemployees\nshould\nbe\nencouraged to participate and should\nfeel their participation is valued.\nBecause employees have operational\nexperience, they often have the best\nknowledge of where improvements\nshould be made. Further, employee\ninvolvement\nand\nparticipation\nis\nessential to translate new ideas into\naction.\nThere should be a plan that\nincorporates learning into everyday\nactivities. The following are elements\nof an organizational learning plan that\n\nhelp create a culture of knowledge\ngeneration, sharing, and development:\n- Solve problems systematically.\nFirst, employees should understand\nthe value of basing decisions on\ndata\nrather\nthan\nassumptions.\nSimple statistical tools should be\nused to organize and analyze data.\nThe use of data and analytic tools is\ncritical to detecting and preventing\nproblems.\n- Experiment. Experimentation is\nessential for cultivating learning.\nExperiments involve searching for\nand\ntesting\nnew\nideas.\nExperimentation\nshould\nbe\nperformed as part of a plan to\nachieve a desired end result, such\nas testing methods to improve\ncustomer satisfaction.\n- Learn from the past.\nOrganizations must learn to track\ntheir attempts at implementing new\nideas and evaluate their successes\nor failures. From this information,\norganizations can make future\ndecisions and create programs\nbased on success and not repeat\nfailures.\n- Learn from others. This is an\nimportant element of TQM and\nshould be encouraged through the\ndevelopment of teams. Through\nemployees working together in\nteams, knowledge is shared and\nbuilt\nupon\nthroughout\nthe\norganization. Employees learn from\none another based on their hands-\non, operational experience and\nperformance.\nTeamwork\nis\nessential in TQM for sharing ideas\nand also for incorporating all work\nfunctions'\nneeds,\nrequirements,\nknowledge, and views into decision\nmaking and planning.\n- Transfer knowledge.\nKnowledge\ngained\nthrough\nproblem solving, experimentation,\nand teamwork should be transferred\nquickly and efficiently throughout\nthe organization to educate all\nworkers about the lessons learned.\nPrinciple 5: Train, Empower, and\nRecognize Employees\nEmployees are a transit system's\nmost important asset. Their value must\nbe protected and enhanced. This means\ntraining employees to identify and\nsolve problems that cause customer\ndissatisfaction; empowering employees\nto take actions to satisfy customers; and\nrecognizing employees for their efforts\nand\ncontributions\nthat\nimprove\nperformance.\nTraining. TQM starts and ends\nwith training. Employees must be\ntrained to work together as a team,\nfocused on meeting and exceeding\ncustomers' needs and expectations.\nThere should be continual retraining to\nmeet ever-changing requirements for\nthe\nfuture,\nparticularly\nwith\nthe\nincreasing availability of sophisticated\ninformation technology.\nTraining is not only important for\nbasic job skills, but also important for\nproblem identification and problem\nsolving. Ongoing training creates a\nknowledgeable work force, which has\nflexible skills and the ability to engage\nin multiple jobs. Management should\nconsider the potential for increasing\ncompensation as employees increase\ntheir skills in multiple job activities.\nEmpowerment.\nEmpowerment\nmeans giving employees the authority\nto do what it takes to satisfy customers.\nOften, this means moving decision\nmaking closer to the front line of the\norganization, rather than keeping it\nsolely in the hands of management.\nThis requires a knowledgeable work\nforce and an environment of trust,\naccountability, and support.\nEmpowerment benefits customers.\nOften,\nempowerment\nreduces\nthe\namount of time required to solve a\nproblem or grant a special request. In\ntraditional vertical organizations, such\nas public transportation, decisions are\ntypically made by management. This\napproach to decision making requires\nfront-line employees to consult their\nmanagers to solve problems or grant\nrequests. Through empowerment, there\nare\nincreased\nopportunities\nfor\nemployees to make decisions in real\ntime, without having to go through the\nchain of command.\nThere\nare\nmany\nbenefits\nto\nempowerment. Empowerment provides\na sense of ownership and control over\nprocesses and job activities. Employees\nfeel a personal responsibility for\nmeeting the expectations of their\ncustomers. Employees are motivated by\nknowing they are entrusted to make the\nright decisions.\nRecognition. Recognition is a\npowerful tool to reinforce and maintain\nquality\nimprovement.\nOngoing\nrecognition\nincreases\nemployee\ninvolvement and helps employees feel\ncommitment\nto\ntheir\nwork\nenvironment.\nRecognition\nalso\nreinforces desired behaviors, builds\nself-esteem, nurtures trust and respect,\nsays \"thank you,\" renews enthusiasm,\naffirms\nself-worth\nand\nvalue,\nempowers, confirms quality values, and\ncelebrates success.\nBoth individual employees and\nteams\nshould\nbe\nrecognized\nfor\nimproving performance and increasing\ncustomer satisfaction. Organizations\nwith formal recognition programs build\nemployee support and ownership in\nquality improvement efforts.\nPrinciple 6: Improve Labor-\nManagement Teamwork\nPolarized\npositions--us\nversus\nthem--have long characterized the\nrelationships between organized labor\nand management in the U.S. public\ntransportation industry, as well as other\nindustries. Labor agreements and work\nrules often overly define and limit\nemployee\nresponsibilities\nand\nemphasize punishment for breaking\nrules. In many transit agencies, more\nattention is paid to the arbitration of\ngrievances than working together to\nimprove\nperformance\nand\nsatisfy\ncustomers.\n\nA continuous and lasting TQM\nprogram is not possible without the\ninvolvement\nof\nemployees.\nIn\norganizations\nwith\nrepresented\nemployees, this means involvement by\nunion officials in policy decision\nmaking\nand\nparticipation\nby\nrepresented employees to improve\nperformance and satisfy customers.\nEmployee teams with represented and\nnonrepresented\nmembers\nmust\nbe\nconcerned with the processes that focus\non customer satisfaction.\nUnder\nthe\nNational\nLabor\nRelations Act (NLRA) law, labor-\nmanagement\ncommittees\ncannot\naddress grievances, labor disputes, rates\nof pay, hours of employment, or\nconditions of work. These areas are the\nsole\nconcern\nof\nformal\nlabor\nnegotiations. To avoid conflicts with\nthe National Labor Relations Board\n(NLRB), the following steps should be\ntaken:\n- Establish a written policy that\nclearly states TQM goals in terms of\nquality enhancement and customer\nsatisfaction.\nThe\npolicy\nshould\nexpressly\nforbid\nteams\nfrom\nworking on initiatives related to\nwages, rates of pay, hours of\nemployment, or conditions of work.\n- Alert team leaders and facilitators\nto avoid discussions related to\ndesignated topics.\n- Advise\nmanagement\npersonnel\nwho work with teams which topics\nare appropriate and which are\ninappropriate.\n- Periodically audit and review\nactual practices to make certain that\nviolations are not occurring.\nPrinciple 7: Lead the Change in\nOrganizational Culture\nThe success of TQM is largely\ndetermined\nby\nleadership\nand\norganizational culture. Leaders must be\ncommitted to TQM to sustain a\nlongterm\neffort\nto\nimprove\nperformance. They must change the\norganizational\nculture\nand\nprovide\nincreased\nopportunity for everyone to satisfy\ncustomers.\nTQM requires cultural change and\ntransformation of organizational rules\nand attitudes. For many employees,\nespecially those who have worked in an\norganization for many years, this new\napproach may be difficult to adjust to\nor accept. Employees may be resistant\nto the change because they feel that the\nold way is better--it's worked in the\npast, why won't it work in the future?\"\n-\"TQM is simply a fad,\" or \"despite the\ncurrent enthusiasm, management will\nnot\ncommit\nor\nfollow-through.\"\nLeaders will meet with resistance to\nchange on many different fronts\nthroughout the organization.\nHow Cultures Develop and\nChange.\nOrganizational\ncultures\ngenerally develop from three sources:\n(1) the beliefs, values, and philosophy\nof the founders or early leaders; (2)\nthe learning experiences of group\nmembers as their organization evolves;\nand (3)\nnew\nbeliefs,\nvalues,\nand\nphilosophy brought in by new members\nand leaders. The philosophies of\nleaders are tested early and are often\nthe root of success or failure. Even in\nlarge, well-established organizations,\nculture can often be traced to the\nbeliefs and values of the founders and\nearly leaders.\nLeaders\ncreate\norganizational\nculture and then perpetuate the culture\nby\ndetermining\nthe\ncriteria\nfor\nleadership and thus, who will or will\nnot be future leaders. Understanding an\norganization's culture, its strengths and\nweaknesses,\nis\ndesirable\nfor\nall\nemployees,\nbut\nis\nessential\nfor\norganization leaders.\nImportantly,\nleaders\nmust\nrecognize the need to change their\norganization culture, when warranted.\nNext, they must get the members of\ntheir organization to accept the need for\nchange and begin the often difficult\ntransition process. Ultimately, leaders\nmust provide a path and process for\ncultural change and assure members of\nthe\norganization\nthat\nconstructive\nchange is necessary and possible.\nLeadership and TQM.\nImplementing TQM requires clear,\nlong-term\nleadership\ncommitment.\nLeadership must believe that long-term\nrelationships with satisfied customers\nare critical assets to the success of the\norganization. Leaders must incorporate\nthis value into strategic planning and\nset customers as the top priority of all\nemployees.\nIt is essential that customer\nsatisfaction be incorporated in the\nvision, mission, and value statements.\nThese\nstatements\ndefine\nstrategic\ndirection--what goals will be pursued\nand how they will be accomplished.\nThe statements incorporate strategy\nalong with operational techniques and\nactivities that are essential to success.\nThey are written commitments that\nestablish a basis for quality planning,\npriority\nsetting,\nand\nfollow-up\nfeedback.\nLeadership is also responsible for\ncreating\n\"customer-focused\nsupport\nsystems\" such as measurement, rewards\nand\nrecognition\nfor\nsatisfying\ncustomers, and training on working\nwith\nand\nachieving\npositive\nrelationships with customers. These\nand other programs will demonstrate to\nemployees that senior management is\ncommitted to TQM.\nLeaders must demonstrate that\nTQM is essential. By witnessing\nleaders\nacting\nas\nrole-models,\nemployees will be more apt to take\ninitiative to meet or exceed customers'\nexpectations. This requires leaders to\nparticipate in education sessions and to\nwork with employees, demonstrating\nthat\neveryone\nis\nresponsible\nfor\n\"putting customers first.\"\nLESSONS OF SUCCESS AND\nFAILURE IN TQM\nMuch has been said and written\nabout TQM--both its success and\nfailure.\nThis\nsection\nsummarizes\nTQM's current track record, based on\nthe writings of management experts.\n\nIs TQM Overrated?\nThe\ntrack\nrecord\nof\nTQM\nprograms has been mixed, with many\nhigh-profile successes and an almost\nequal number of failures. According to\nThomas Hout, Vice President at the\nBoston\nConsulting\nGroup:\n\"The\nmajority of quality efforts fizzle out\nearly, or give some improvements but\nnever fulfill their initial promise.\"2\nThe Harvard Business Review\nrecently\nreported\nthat,\nof\nelectronics companies surveyed, 73\npercent had TQM efforts underway, but\nonly 37 percent had achieved more than\na 10 percent reduction in product\ndefects. McKinsey & Company, a\nconsulting firm, found that two-thirds\nof the quality programs at major\ncorporations are failing or stalled.\nAnother consulting firm, Arthur D.\nLittle, surveyed 500 executives and\nfound that only 36 percent believed\nTQM improved competitiveness.3\nWhile experts believe that TQM\nprinciples are sound, many companies\nhave simply not implemented the\nconcepts\nproperly.\nAccording\nto\nChristopher Hart, President of the Spire\nGroup and a former Harvard Business\nSchool professor:\nTwenty years ago, the data\nprocessing function was being\ntaken to a new conceptual level\nunder the label 'management\ninformation systems.' Did any\ncompanies\nback\nthen\nspend\nmillions of dollars developing\nsystems that didn't work? Yes;\nhorror stories abound. Does that\nmean that the MIS concept was\nrelegated to the scrap heap? No!\nIt means that MIS was a\ncomplicated, rapidly emerging\nfield\nwith\ntremendous\nopportunities\nfor\nlearning--in\nother words, many mistakes were\nmade--and learning over the\nyears has minimized problems.\nTQM is in the same situation as\nMIS was twenty years ago.\nQuality is here to stay! It makes\nsense for the customer; it makes\nsense for the company; it makes\nsense for the employee, and it's\nthe moral thing to do.4\nWhen Does TQM Fail?\nCompanies have experienced a\nvariety of specific problems with TQM\nimplementation. First, because TQM is\na unifying philosophy that transforms\nbusinesses, it sometimes results in\ninternal debates over basic strategy.\nFurthermore, there are numerous TQM\nmethods\nand\nimplementation\napproaches, some of which may be\nincompatible. Finally, because senior\nmanagers\nmay\ndelegate\nquality\nleadership, some organizations develop\ninternal TQM bureaucracies that are\njust as ineffective and insulated as other\nfunctional departments.5\nOther possible reasons for failure\naccording to the American Quality\nFoundation include the following:\n\"Americans react poorly to programs\ngeared to perfection,\" \"70 percent of\nAmerican workers are afraid to speak\nup with suggestions or to ask for\nclarification,\" and \"Americans prefer to\njump into a project without heavy\nplanning.\"6\nWhen Does TQM Succeed?\nIn 1993, Ernst & Young and the\nAmerican\nQuality\nFoundation\npublished the Best Practices Report,\nresulting\nfrom\ntheir\nongoing\nInternational\nQuality\nStudy.\nThey\nfound that three types of initiatives had\na significant impact on successful\nperformance: (1) process improvement,\n(2) full deployment of strategic plans,\nand (3) supplier chain participation.\nProcess improvement, as discussed\nelsewhere\nin\nthis\ndigest,\nmeans\nchanging the way things are done.\nDeployment\nof\nstrategy\nmeans\neveryone must understand and share\nthe\nsame\nvision.\nSupplier\nchain\nparticipation\nmeans\nencouraging\nsuppliers to adopt TQM methods\nthemselves, to ensure that the 'input'\nreceived will not cause problems.7\nBrad Stratton, editor of Quality\nProgress magazine, said that the\nfollowing conditions are necessary for\na successful TQM program. First, the\ncorporate\nculture must be prepared and ready for\nchange. Second, people must be\nrewarded\nfor\nnew\nthinking\nand\nencouraged to report bad news. Third,\nTQM must have a strong champion\nwho is willing and able to exert\nleadership.\nFourth,\nimplementation\nmust be from the top down, with active\nand sustained participation by senior\nmanagement. Fifth, every employee\nshould be trained and involved. Sixth,\norganizations\nmust\ncontinuously\nimprove\ntheir\ntraining\nprograms,\nadding new and more sophisticated\ntools to employees' skills repertoires to\nsustain\nmomentum.\nSeventh,\norganizations need to establish a proper\n\"balance of statistical and social skills.\"\nFinally,\npeople\nmust\nbe\npatient.\nMeaningful change takes time.8\nPILOT TQM INITIATIVES\nImportant objectives of Project F\n3 included identifying up to four transit\nsystems interested in initiating or\nadvancing TQM and providing support\nfor their efforts. The four transit\nagencies should be diverse in size,\nservices provided, geographic location,\nand labor environment. By initiating\nand subsequently evaluating TQM in\nthese\ndiverse\ntransit\nsettings,\ninformation and insights should be\ngained that may benefit the U.S. transit\nindustry as a whole.\nConducting the four pilot TQM\ninitiatives serves a number of purposes:\n- Provides an opportunity to apply\nand test TQM principles in public\ntransportation environments, which\nto date have largely been applied in\nthe private sector or other parts of\nthe public sector.\n- Tailors TQM principles to better\nserve\nthe\nneeds\nand\nunique\ncharacter of public transportation\nthrough field testing.\n- Ensures the preparation of more\nmeaningful\ninformational\nand\neducational materials on TQM,\nwhich\n\nwill be useful to transit agencies that\npursue TQM in the future.\nThis\ndigest\nbriefly\ndiscusses\nthe\nselection of the pilot participants,\nprovides highlights of the four transit\nagencies, and reviews their interest in\nTQM at the outset of the pilot\ninitiatives.\nIdentification of Candidate Public\nTransportation Agencies\nThe Survey of Chief Executive\nOfficers, which included 590 public\ntransportation systems throughout the\nUnited States, served as the primary\nbasis for identifying four candidate\ntransit agencies for the TQM pilot\ninitiatives. In this confidential survey,\nthe CEOs were asked a number of\nquestions\nregarding\ntheir\ntransit\nsystem's environment, their general\ninterest in TQM, their efforts to pursue\nexcellence and quality, and their\ninterest in being a candidate for a TQM\ninitiative under this project.\nOf the 172 respondents to the\nsurvey,\npublic\ntransportation\nagencies were identified as candidates\nusing the following criteria:\n- Labor-management\nrelations.\n\"We have considerable trust and\nrespect\nbetween\nlabor\nand\nmanagement.\" CEO responses to\nthis statement were required to range\nfrom neutral to strongly agree.\nWhile TQM can render assistance in\nimproving the trust and respect\nbetween labor and management,\novercoming poor relations between\nthe parties is not the principal focus\nof the quality effort.\n- Interest in participation. \"I am\nvery\ninterested\nin\nhaving\nour\norganization participate in a TQM\npilot program as described in your\ncorrespondence.\" CEO responses to\nthis statement were required to range\nfrom highly to strongly agree. Since\nTQM begins at the top, it was\nimportant that the CEO responded\nenthusiastically.\n- Labor\nagreement\nexpiration\ndate. This project is not intended to\ncompete for the attention of labor\nand management leadership during\ncollective bargaining. TQM initially\nrequires labor and management\nleadership to focus on the plans and\nfuture events associated with quality\nefforts. The pilot initiatives are, in\nthemselves, difficult to successfully\nlaunch.\nTherefore,\ncollective\nbargaining agreements of the pilot\nparticipants\ncould\nnot\nexpire\nbetween February 1994 and June\n1995.\nThe Project Panel requested that\ntransit agencies with fewer than 50\nvehicles operating in peak periods not\nbe considered as pilot TQM candidates.\nThis decision reduced the number of\ncandidate transit systems from 30 to 12.\nA public transportation organization\nwith less than 50 peak vehicles was\nconsidered not sufficiently complex to\ntest and evaluate TQM.\nThe Project Panel requested that\nthe CEOs of the 12 final candidate\ntransit agencies be interviewed by\ntelephone to better determine their\ninterest in the project and their\nwillingness and ability to commit the\ntime and resources required from\nparticipants. Questions were sent to\neach CEO in advance of the telephone\ninterviews. The responses from the\ninterviews were subsequently sent to\neach Panel member for review and\nselection of the four finalists.\nFour Pilot Participants\nThe Project Panel selected the\nfollowing participants: the Chicago\nTransit Authority (CTA)--one of the\nlargest rail and bus transit systems in\nthe United States; the Pee Dee Regional\nTransportation Authority (PDRTA)--a\nmulticounty, mostly rural, southeastern\nU.S. system, which largely provides\nparatransit services; the Southwest\nOhio\nRegional\nTransit\nAuthority\n(Metro)--a\nmid-to-large-size\nbus\nservice in the mid-west; and the\nSpokane Transit Authority (STA)--a\nmid-size, west-coast bus system.\nTable 1 briefly describes the agencies,\nhighlighting these characteristics.\nOnce the pilot participants were\nselected, the research team scheduled a\nmeeting with each of the four selected\ntransit agencies, and requested that\neach meeting be attended by, at least,\nthe CEO, the chair of the governing\nboard, and the president(s) of the local\nlabor union(s). The purpose of each\nmeeting was to provide a more in-depth\npresentation of the objectives and\nrequirements of the pilot initiatives,\nanswer\nquestions\nconcerning\nparticipation, and permit withdrawal\nfrom\nparticipation\nby\nany\nparty.\nFollowing these meetings, all four\ntransit agencies made a year-long\ncommitment and agreed to the terms\nand requirements for participation in\nthe pilot TQM initiatives.\nInitiation of the TQM Pilots\nAt the outset of the pilot activities,\neach of the four transit agencies was at\na different stage in its thinking and\nconsideration\nof\nTQM.\nSenior\nmanagement at CTA had formulated\nideas about changing its corporate\nphilosophy\nto\na\ncustomer-focused\nculture. Metro had been active, with\ngood results, for about 2 years with its\nvisioning\nprocess\nand\nemployee\nparticipation\nprogram.\nSTA\nmanagement was aware of TQM and\nwas learning about what it took to\ninitiate its effort. PDRTA had no prior\ninvolvement in quality programs.\nTo provide a common point of\ndeparture for the pilot activities,\nLeadership Workshops were held to\nintroduce and discuss TQM, establish a\nfoundation for the pilot activities,\nclarify roles and responsibilities, and\nprepare a draft TQM action plan for\neach\nparticipating\nagency.\nThe\nworkshops, which each lasted from 11⁄2\nto 2 days, included presentations, group\ndiscussions, and video tapes about\nquality. Manuals were prepared and\ndistributed to each participant, as a\nworkshop guide.\n\nTable 1 Public transportation agency participants in the TQM pilot initiatives\n\nDuring the balance of this research\nproject, assistance will be provided to\nthe participating transit systems to\nfurther develop and implement their\npilot TQM initiatives; provide training\nto a designated quality coordinator or\nfacilitator at each system, as well as\nmembers\nof\nquality\nimprovement\nteams; support and guide each TQM\npilot to achieve its objectives; trouble\nshoot, as needed; and evaluate and\ndocument\nthe\nfour\npilot\nTQM\ninitiatives.\nRESEARCH RESULTS,\nDOCUMENTATION, AND\nPRODUCTS\nA number of products resulting\nfrom this project will serve different\naudiences\nand\nmeet\ndifferent\nobjectives. These products include the\nfollowing:\n- Final report. This report will (1)\npresent\nthe\nresearch\nresults\nincluding\nthe\nliterature\nsearch,\ninvestigation of TQM in the public\nand private sectors, and principles\nfor TQM in public transportation;\nand (2)\ndocument the pilot TQM\ninitiatives, including the selection of\nparticipants,\nplan\ndevelopment,\ntraining, facilitation, support, and\nevaluation of each effort.\n- Informational materials. These\nmaterials will be designed for transit\nexecutives, union leadership, and\nboard members to introduce TQM.\nA brochure and video tape are\ncurrently being considered as the\nmedia for presenting material, which\nshould help individuals responsible\nfor\npublic\ntransportation\nmanagement\nand\nperformance\ndecide to further investigate or make\na commitment to TQM.\n- Educational materials. A user-\nfriendly TQM Guidebook for Public\nTransportation will be prepared that\nexpands\non\nthe\ninformational\nmaterials, including a TQM road\nmap,\nsample\nmeeting\nagenda,\ncustomer surveys, and additional\nTQM resources.\nAll final products will be available\nthrough the TCRP in the fall of 1995.\nAn Interim Phase I Research Report is\navailable at this time.

Crosby\ntells how to manage quality so that it becomes a source of profit for your business. Case histories demonstrate how quality\nconcepts have worked in actual business situations.\nDeming, W.E., Out of the Crisis, MIT Center for Advanced Engineering Study, Cambridge, MA (1982).\nDr. Deming shows the way \"out of the crisis\" with his famous 14 Points. This book teaches the transformation that is required\nfor survival--a transformation that can only be accomplished by man. Dr. Deming encourages long-term commitment to new\nlearning and new philosophy. He stresses new principles of training and leadership, the need for clear operational definitions,\nand common and special causes of improvement. \"A company cannot buy its way into quality,\" he writes,--\"it must be led into\nquality by top management.\"\nImai, M., Kaizen: The Key to Japan's Competitive Success, Random House, Inc., New York NY (1986).\nKaizen means gradual, unending improvement, doing \"little things\" better; setting--and achieving--ever-higher standards. In\nthis classic book, Imai Masaki describes how a process-oriented, customer-driven strategy of involving everyone (both\nmanagers and workers) in the continuous improvement of products and services will lead to improved quality and\nproductivity.\nJuran, J.M., Juran on Leadership for Quality: An Executive Handbook, The Free Press, New York, NY (1989).\nJuran lays out his famed \"Juran Trilogy\" on how to apply the familiar business concepts of \"planning, controlling, and\nimproving\" to quality leadership. He gives criteria for selecting project-by-project improvements and for picking a team to\ncarry them out. He also describes a realistic timetable for implementation and directs the formulation of an ongoing quality\ncouncil.\nWalton, M., The Deming Management Method, The Putnam Publishing Group, New York, NY (1986).\nIn this book, Mary Walton describes how the Deming Method is used by firms and organizations from all over the industrial\nspectrum, including service industries and manufacturing.

Without this, little real change will result. In place of the \"managerial\nclass system\" the author says, we need to reintegrate the managing of work with the doing of work. Everybody manages and\neverybody does real work.\nBelasco, J.A., Teaching the Elephant to Dance: The Manager's Guide to Empowering Change, Penguin Books, New York, NY (1991).\nThis book gives every manager a step-by-step guide to making the impossible happen and is filled with illuminating case\nhistories of companies large and small that have maneuvered out of stagnation to get back into the competitive mainstream. It\nshows how to devise new corporate vision and strategies, how to overcome inertia and inbred adherence to \"how it has always\nbeen done,\" and how to make both management and labor trail-blazers rather than road-blockers to new standards of\nexcellence.\nCovey, S.R., Principle-Centered Leadership, Summit Books, Fort Worth, TX (1990).\nHow do you transform the paradigms of people and organizations from reactive, control-centered management to proactive,\nempowerment-oriented leadership? While Deming's theory of total quality explains the \"what\" to do and gives a partial\nexplanation of \"why' it should be done, Covey supplies the missing \"how-to-do-it.\" The Seven Habits are foundation\nprinciples that, when applied consistently in practice, become behaviors enabling fundamental transformations of individuals,\nrelationships, and organizations.\nGarvin, D.A., Managing Quality: The Strategic and Competitive Edge, The Free Press, New York, NY (1988).\nThis critical yet enlightening analysis illustrates how America must improve quality to win back lost markets and gain long-\nterm competitive advantage. Comparing quality management in Japanese and American plants producing the same products,\nGarvin provides the evidence relating to quality to such variables as process, productivity, and profitability. His focused study\nof 9 Japanese and 11 American factories makes clear what the Japanese have done better than even the best U.S. companies.\nSchein, E.H., Organizational Culture and Leadership, Jossey-Bass Publishers, San Francisco, CA (1992).\nThis second edition transforms the abstract concept of culture into a tool that managers and students have continually used to\nbetter understand the dynamics of organizations and change.

Three avenues of\napproach for dealing with performance issues are explored: through organizational strategies, structures and management\npractices; through the processes used to get work done; and through individual jobs and employees.\nAdditional Sources\nKing, B., Hoshin Planning--The Developmental Approach, Goal/QPC (1989).\nSirkin, H. and Stalk, G., Jr., \"Fix the Process, Not the Problem,\" Harvard Business Review, Cambridge, MA (July-Aug. 1990), pp. 1-8.\nTRAINING AND TOOLS\nAmerican Quality Foundation and Ernst & Young, \"The International Quality Study: Best Practices Report, An Analysis of Management\nPractices that Impact Performance,\" (1993).

Is this a business strategy you believe in? The promise of\nempowerment is that it will dramatically increase the sense of responsibility and ownership at every level of the organization,\nespecially at the bottom where products and services are delivered and customers are served. \"As you give employees more\nand more freedom,\" Block says, \"expect a very mixed response. There is a part of us that does not want more autonomy,\nchoice, or responsibility. We want to be taken care of.\" The goal of his book is to present a way of being political that balances\nthe hope for transforming organizations with the risk in attempting change, in a realistic and helpful way.\nBlanchard, K., Carew, D., and Parisi-Carew, E., The One-Minute Manager: Builds High Performance Teams, William Morrow and\nCompany, Inc., New York, NY (1990).\nBenefit from learning how to develop through the four stages of team development.

The authors argue that America will continue to lag behind its competitors as\nlong as corporate decision making is blocked by an outworn, adversarial system of labor-management relations that no longer\nserves the interests of workers, stockholders, and the nation.\nCohen-Rosenthal, E. and Burton, C.E., Mutual Gains: A Guide to Union-Management Cooperation, ILR Press, 2nd ed, rev., Ithaca, NY\n(1993).\nWhile quality efforts can be an excellent way to showcase how union-management cooperation, both parties should be vigilant\nto the real hazards, risks, and potential losses associated with them. The key to success is to position quality efforts solidly\nwithin the collective bargaining relationship on a foundation of union-management cooperation. A management and union can\ndo almost\n\nanything that they set out to do, when they summon their imaginations and are dedicated to having the highest-quality\ncooperation in order to provide the highest quality service.\nApplebaum, E. and Batt, R., The New American Workplace: Transforming Work Systems in the United States, ILR Press, Ithaca, NY\n(1994).\nThere are two basic routes that get you to a high-performance workplace. These authors review several decades of U.S. and\ninternational cases to identify two distinct and coherent models of high-performance work systems--what is referred to in the\nbook as an American version of lean production and an American version of team production. The two systems produce\nsimilar results and improvements in performance. While the outcomes for companies may be similar, the outcomes for\nemployees are apt to be quite different. The lean model is the one used predominately by U.S. employers: a centralized, top-\ndown approach to employee relations which is reinforced by the criteria of the Baldrige Award. Only 15 percent of the Award\nformula deals in improvement in human resource development and management, just 2 percent with employee involvement,\nand 2.5 percent with morale.\nAdditional Sources\nCohen-Rosenthal, E. and Burton, C., \"Improving Organizational Quality by Forging the Best Union-Management Relationship,\"\nNational Productivity Review, Spring 1994.\nCollective Bargaining Form, \"Labor-Management Commitment: A Compact for Change,\" Bureau of Labor-Management Relations and\nCooperative Program, U.S. Department of Labor, BLMR 141 (1991).\nRubenstein, S.P., \"Democracy and Quality as an Integrated System,\" Quality Progress (Sept. 1993) pp. 51-55.\nCUSTOMER SERVICE\nDavidow, W.H. and Uttal, B., Total Customer Service: The Ultimate Weapon: A Six-Point Plan for Giving Your Business the\nCompetitive Edge in the 1990s, Harper & Row Publishers, New York, NY (1989).\nDrawing on in-depth case histories of service leaders who have triumphed and of laggards who have lost, Davidow and Uttal\nhave devised a six-point plan that any company--regardless of what business it is in--can utilize to secure a decisive\ncompetitive edge: devise a service strategy; get managers to behave like customer service fanatics; concentrate on motivating\nand training employees; design products and services that make good customer service possible; invest in service\ninfrastructure; and constantly monitor achievement of customer service goals.\nHart, C.W.L., Extraordinary Guarantees: A New Way to Build Quality Throughout Your Company and Ensure Satisfaction for Your\nCustomers, American Management Association, New York, NY (1993).\nIn this innovative book, Hart describes the power of the extraordinary guarantee--one that does not merely limit a customer's\nrisk but promises exceptional, uncompromising quality and customer satisfaction, and backs that promise with a payout\nintended to recapture the customer's good will and continued business. The book examines different types of guarantees and\ndiscusses their benefits from a marketing and an operational standpoint.\nHeskett, J.L., Sasser, W.E., and Hart, C.W.L., Service Breakthroughs: Changing the Rules of the Game, The Free Press, New York, NY\n(1990).\nBased on five years of research in 14 service industries, Heskett, Sasser, and Hart show exactly what enables one or two\ncompanies in each industry to constantly set new standards for quality and value that force competitors to adapt or fail. At the\nheart of breakthrough performance, the authors contend, is a sometimes intuitive but thorough understanding of the \"self\nreinforcing service cycle\" that replaces traditional management of \"trade-offs.\" The \"cycle\" is a paradigm derived from the\nresearch results suggesting direct links between heightened customer satisfaction, increased customer retention, augmented\nsales and profit, improved quality and productivity, greater service value per unit cost, improved satisfaction of service\nproviders, increased employee retention, and further heightened customer satisfaction.\nReichheld, F.E. and Sasser, W.E., Jr., \"Zero Defections: Quality Comes to Services,\" Harvard Business Review, Cambridge, MA (Sept.-\nOct. 1990), pp. 105-111.\nThis article provides a compelling rationale for both guarantees and service recovery, by spelling out the hard costs of losing\ndissatisfied customers.\nAdditional Sources\nAlbrecht, K., At America's Service: How Corporations Can Revolutionize the Way They Treat Their Customers, Dow Jones-Irwin,\nHomewood, IL (1988).\n\nAlbrecht, K. and Zemke, R., Service America!

Above all, service quality must be adapted to\ncustomer needs. A whole range of possibilities exist to make public transport more appealing: more frequent and punctual\nservice, better equipment, improved customer relations, electronic payment facilities and more convenient connections are just\na few of these.\nPapers and presentations that are provided in the book include case studies from Barcelona, Spain; Gothenburg, Sweden;\nLyons, France; and Munich, Germany.\nPeters, T.J. and Waterman, R.H., Jr., In Search of Excellence: Lessons from America's Best-Run Companies, Warner Books, New York,\nNY (1982).\nThe authors studied 43 successful American companies and discovered that these companies shared eight basic principles of\nmanagement that are readily transferable.

The impact of Deming's\nteaching was widespread and swift to\ntake root. In 1951, JUSE instituted the\nDeming Prize to honor Deming for his\nfriendship and achievements in industrial\nquality\ncontrol.\nToday,\nJapanese\ncompanies wishing to improve the level\nof quality within their organization\ncompete for the Deming Prize, not only\nto achieve the honor and prestige of\nwinning, but also the improvements that\ncome from implementing his quality\nprinciples.\ndeployment\nOne of the evaluative dimensions used in\nBaldrige scoring, \"deployment\" refers to\nthe extent to which a company's\napproaches are applied in all relevant\nareas and activities For example, reward\nand-recognition programs need to be\napplied to all categories of employees,\nfrom hourly workers to top managers\ndescriptors\nDescriptors\nare\nrelatively\nspecific\nmethods, organizational features, or\nsystem/process\ncharacteristics\nthat\nillustrate or help interpret each area to\naddress in the application.\ndifferentiation\nThe unique value of a product or service\nthat distinguishes it from competing\nproducts or services.\neffectiveness\nHow closely an organization's output\nmeets\nits\ngoal\nand/or\nmeets\nthe\ncustomer's requirements.\nefficiency\nProduction\nof\nrequired\noutput\nat\nperceived minimum cost.

Customers can be internal\nas well as external to the organizational\nsystem (e.g., products or services may\nflow to the person at the next desk or\nwork area rather than to people outside\nof the immediate organization). The\nFederal Quality Institute defines quality\nas meeting the customer requirements the\nfirst time every time. The Department of\nDefense (DOD) defines quality as\nconformance to a set of customer\nrequirements that , if met, result in a\nproduct that is fit for its intended use.\nQuality Approach\nOverall strategy for managing quality in\nan organization; \"blueprint\" for the\norganization's quality system.\nquality assurance (QA)\nA phase in the evolution of the quality\ndiscipline, QA differed from statistical\nquality control, its predecessor, in that all\nfunctional groups, not just engineers and\nworkers on the shop floor, were involved\nin the quality effort. However, QA is\nmore\nnarrowly\nfocused\nthan\nits\nsuccessor, total quality management\n(TQM),\nwhich\nemphasizes\nsenior-\nexecutive involvement, the management\nof quality for competitive advantage, and\na strong customer orientation.\nquality circles\nA group of workers and their supervisors\nwho voluntarily meet to identify and\nsolve job-related problems.

In contrast to a linear,\nsequential\napproach\nin\nwhich\ncommunication between functions is\npoor and the production process is\nmarred by rework, scrap, poor quality,\nand frustration, simultaneous engineering\n\nmaximizes\ncommunication,\nreduces\nerrors, and shortens cycle times.\nsix-sigma\nA statistical way of measuring quality,\nsix-sigma is equivalent to 3.4 defects per\nmillion units of output--a virtually\ndefect-free level of performance. The\nambitious, companywide goal of \"six\nsigma quality\" has been adopted, most\nnotably, by Motorola, a 1988 Baldrige\nAward winner.\nspecial cause\nAn \"abnormal\" source of variation that\ndoes not arise from the production\nprocess itself, but which is extraneous\nand unpredictable.\nspecification\nA\ndocument\ncontaining\na\ndetailed\ndescription or enumeration of particulars\nFormal description of a work product\nand the intended manner of providing it\n(the provider's view of the work\nproduct).\nstandard deviation\nA parameter describing the spread of the\nprocess output, denoted by the Greek\nletter sigma. The positive square root of\nthe variance.\nstatistic\nAny parameter that can be determined on\nthe\nbasis\nof\nthe\nquantitative\ncharacteristics of a sample. A descriptive\nstatistic is a computed measure of some\nproperty of a set of values, making\npossible a definitive statement about the\nmeaning of the collected data. An\ninferential\nstatistic\nindicates\nthe\nconfidence that can be placed in any\nstatement\nregarding\nits\nexpected\naccuracy, the range of its applicability,\nand the probability of its being true.\nConsequently, decisions can be based on\ninferential statistics.\nstatistical process control (SPC)\nBased on the principle that no two units\nof output of a process are likely to have\nthe exact same specifications, SPC\ninvolves the mathematical determination\nof acceptable limits of variation. Graphs\nare used by workers to plot output\nvariables and visually determine when a\nprocess is \"in\" or \"out of\" control.\nstatistical control\nThe status of a process from which all\nspecial causes of variation have been\nremoved and only common causes\nremain. Such a process is also said to be\nstable.\nstatistical estimation\nThe analysis of a sample parameter in\norder to predict the values of the\ncorresponding population parameter\nstatistical methods\nThe\napplication\nof\nthe\ntheory\nof\nprobability to problems of variation.\nThere are two groups of statistical\nmethods. Basic statistical methods are\nrelatively simple problem-solving tools\nand techniques, such as control charts,\ncapability analysis, data summarization\nand analysis, and statistical inference.\nAdvanced statistical methods are more\nsophisticated specialized techniques of\nstatistical analysis, such as the design of\nexperiments, regression and correlation\nanalysis, and the analyses of variance.\nstatistical quality control (SQC)\nA relatively early development in the\nevolution of the quality discipline, SQC\nrelies on statistical concepts and tools\n(e.g., sampling techniques) to control\nproduction quality. SQC techniques are\nused\nin\ntotal\nquality\nmanagement,\nalthough the emphasis in TQM is on\n\"building quality in,\" rather than error\ndetection.\nstatistics\nThe branch of applied mathematics that\ndescribes\nand\nanalyzes\nempirical\nobservations\nfor\nthe\npurpose\nof\npredicting certain events in order to\nmake decisions in the face of uncertainty\nStatistics, in turn, are based on the theory\nof probability. The two together provide\nthe abstraction for the mathematical\nmodel underlying the study of problems\ninvolving uncertainty.\nstrategy\nA broad course of action, chosen from a\nnumber of alternatives, to accomplish a\nstated goal of uncertainty\nstretch goal\nAn ambitious, usually long-term quality\ngoal that requires extraordinary effort,\ninnovation, and planning to achieve.\nsubprocesses\nThe internal processes that make up a\nprocess.\nsupplier\nSource of material and/or information\ninput to a process, which may be internal\nor external to the company, organization,\nor group.\nteam building\nA process of developing and maintaining\na group of people who are working\ntoward a common goal. Team building\nusually focuses on one or more of the\nfollowing objectives: (1) clarifying role\nexpectations and obligations of team\nmembers,\n(2)\nimproving\nsuperior-\nsubordinate or peer relationships, (3)\nimproving problem solving, decision\nmaking, resource utilization, or planning\nactivities, (4) reducing conflict, and (5)\nimproving organizational climate\ntimeliness\nThe promptness with which quality\nproducts and services are delivered,\nrelative to customer expectations.\ntotal quality control (TQC)\nAn\nexpression\ncoined\nby\nArmand\nFeigenbaum,\nTQC\ninvolves\nthe\napplication of quality principles in all\nprocesses and at all levels of a company.\ntotal quality management (TQM)\nTQM, as embodied in the Baldrige\ncriteria, represents the latest phase in the\nevolution of the quality discipline.\nDistinctive features are a strong and\npervasive customer orientation and a\nview toward managing quality for\ncompetitive advantage. The term \"TQM\"\nis roughly equivalent to TQC and\nCWQC in Japan, where the word\n\"control\" has the same connotations as\n\"management\" in this country.\ntransactional analysis\nA process that helps people change to be\nmore effective on the job and can also\nhelp organizations to change. The\nprocess involves several exercises that\nhelp identify organizational scripts and\ngames that people may be playing. The\nresults help point the way toward change.\ntransfer to operations\nAn activity or series of activities in\nwhich operating personnel are trained in\nthe performance of a new manufacturing\nor service-delivery process.\nvalue\nThe extent to which a product or service\nmeets a customer's needs or wants, which\ncan be measured (though not easily) in\nwillingness to pay. Also, the benefit, or\nutility, a customer receives from a\nproduct or service.\n\nvariable\nA data item that takes on values within\nsome range with a certain frequency or\npattern. Variables may be discrete, that\nis, limited in value to integer quantities\n(e.g., the number of bolts produced in a\nmanufacturing\nprocess).\nDiscretevariables relate to attribute data.\nVariables may also be continuous, that\nis, measured to any desired degree of\naccuracy (e.g., the diameter of a shaft).\nContinuous variables relate to variables\ndata.\nvariance\nIn quality management terminology, any\nnonconformance to specifications. In\nstatistics, it is the square of the standard\ndeviation.\nvision\nThe desired future state of business.\nworld-class\nRanking among the best across all\ncomparable\nproducts,\nservices,\nor\nprocesses (not just direct competitors) in\nterms of critical performance or features\nzero defects\nAn approach to quality improvement,\nbased primarily on increasing worker\nmotivation and attentiveness, in which\nthe only acceptable quality standard is\ndefect-free output or service execution."

TCRP, modeled after the\nlongstanding and successful National Cooperative Highway Research\nProgram, undertakes research and other technical activities in\nresponse to the needs of transit service providers. The scope of TCRP\nincludes a variety of transit research fields including planning,\nservice configuration, equipment, facilities, operations, human\nresources, maintenance, policy, and administrative practices\nTCRP was established under FTA sponsorship in July 1992\nProposed by the U S Department of Transportation, TCRP was\nauthorized as part of the Intermodal Surface Transportation\nEfficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA) On May 13, 1992, a memorandum\nagreement outlining TCRP operating procedures was executed by the\nthree cooperating organizations: FTA, the National Academy of\nSciences, acting through the Transportation Research Board (TRB),\nand the Transit Development Corporation, Inc (TDC), a nonprofit\neducational and research organization established by APTA TDC is\nresponsible for forming the independent governing board, designated\nas the TCRP Oversight and Project Selection (TOPS) Committee\nResearch\nproblem\nstatements\nfor\nTCRP\nare\nsolicited\nperiodically but may be submitted to TRB by anyone at any time.

This\ninformation has resulted from research and from the successful application of solutions to problems\nby individuals or organizations. There is a continuing need to provide a systematic means for\ncompiling this information and making it available to the entire transit community in a usable format.\nThe Transit Cooperative Research Program includes a synthesis series designed to search for and\nsynthesize useful knowledge from all available sources and to prepare documented reports on current\npractices in subject areas of concern to the transit industry.\nThis synthesis series reports on various practices, making specific recommendations where\nappropriate but without the detailed directions usually found in handbooks or design manuals.\nNonetheless, these documents can serve similar purposes, for each is a compendium of the best\nknowledge available on measures found to be successful in resolving specific problems. The extent to\nwhich these reports are useful will be tempered by the user's knowledge and experience in the\nparticular problem area.\nThis synthesis will be of interest to transit agency general managers, financial officers, policy and\nplanning personnel, and others concerned with the economic and budget aspects of providing transit\nservice, as well as funding officials and policymakers in organizations such as departments of\ntransportation (DOTs) and metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs). This synthesis explores\ncurrent practice and trends regarding the linkages between financial assistance, service provision, and\nperformance measurement. It provides an overview of selected transit agency funding programs, as\nwell as some current information from state DOTs.\nAdministrators, practitioners, and researchers are continually faced with problems on which\nthere is much information, either in the form of reports or in terms of undocumented experience and\npractice. Unfortunately, this information often is scattered and or not readily available in the\nliterature, and, as a consequence, in seeking solutions, full information on what has been learned\nabout a problem frequently is not assembled. Costly research findings may go unused, valuable\nexperience may be overlooked, and full consideration may not be given to the available methods of\nsolving or alleviating the problem. In an effort to correct this situation, the Transit Cooperative\nResearch Program (TCRP) Synthesis Project, carried out by the Transportation Research Board as the\nresearch agency, has the objective of reporting on common transit problems and synthesizing\navailable information. The synthesis reports from this endeavor constitute a TCRP publication series\nin which various forms of relevant information are assembled into single, concise documents\npertaining to a specific problem or closely related problems.\nThis report of the Transportation Research Board examines the role of performance measurement\nin financing transit service. Specifically, the role of state government in assisting local transit service\nis discussed, as well as the challenges in the use of performance measurement. Survey results from\nboth funding agencies and funding recipients are presented along with selected case study examples\nof methods used to apportion transit operating funds.\n\nTo develop this synthesis in a comprehensive manner and to ensure inclusion of significant\nknowledge, available information was assembled from numerous sources, including selected\npublic transportation agencies. A topic panel of experts in the subject area was established to\nguide the researchers in organizing and evaluating the collected data, and to review the final\nsynthesis report.\nThis synthesis is an immediately useful document that records practices that were acceptable\nwithin the limitations of the knowledge available at the time of its preparation. As the processes\nof advancement continue, new knowledge can be expected to be added to that now on hand.\n\nCONTENTS\nSUMMARY\nCHAPTER ONE\nINTRODUCTION\nSynthesis Focus, 5\nSynthesis Organization, 5\nCHAPTER TWO\nCHALLENGES IN THE USE OF PERFORMANCE MEASURES\nGeneral Discussion on Performance Measurement, 6\nEfficiency and Effectiveness Measures, 7\nApplying Performance Measures, 7\nRespondents' Perspective, 8\nPerformance Information for Monitoring, 9\nCHAPTER THREE\nTHE ROLE OF STATE, REGIONAL, AND LOCAL\nGOVERNMENTS IN ASSISTING LOCAL TRANSIT SERVICES\nInterest in Supporting Transit, 10\nCHAPTER FOUR\nSURVEY RESULTS\nMethodology, 12\nFindings, 12\nResults and Impacts, 15\nPerformance Allocation System Profiles, 15\nSummary, 15\nCHAPTER FIVE\nCASE STUDIES\nPennsylvania Department of Transportation, 17\nIndiana Department of Transportation, 19\nTexas Department of Transportation, 21\nCHAPTER SIX\nCONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FURTHER RESEARCH\nConclusions, 25\nRecommendations for Further Research, 26\nREFERENCES\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\nAPPENDIX A\nEXAMPLES OF PERFORMANCE MEASURES AND\nOBJECTIVES/DEFINITION OF PERFORMANCE MEASURES\nAPPENDIX B\nEXAMPLES OF TRANSIT SYSTEM PERFORMANCE REPORTS\nAPPENDIX C\nSURVEY FORMS AND TALLIES OF RESPONSES\nAPPENDIX D\nSURVEY RESPONDENTS\n\nTCRP COMMITTEE FOR PROJECT J-7\nCHAIR\nJACK REILLY\nCapital District Transit Authority\nMEMBERS\nGERALD BLAIR\nIndiana County Transit Authority\nKENNETH J.

It explores current practices, as well as the\nissues and concerns of those on either end of the funding pipeline. The synthesis is largely based on a survey of\nselected state departments of transportation, regional financing bodies, and local transit authorities. A literature\nsearch was also conducted, as well as detailed follow-up discussions with a number of those responding to the\nsurvey.\nFor the purposes of this synthesis, the many definitions of performance measurement that are commonly used\nhave been condensed as follows:\nPerformance measurement is the assessment of an organization's output as a product of the\nmanagement of its internal resources (dollars, people, vehicles, facilities) and the environment in which it\noperates.\nIn simple terms, performance-based funding links financial assistance to improved performance. Performance\ncan be defined in terms of the key programmatic goals the funding agency seeks to accomplish--what\npolicymakers think is important. Sometimes this entails the traditional measures of efficiency and effectiveness.\nLess frequently, it can mean something more specific to the funding agency's view of the world--the degree of\nlocal financial contribution, for example. Performance-based allocation generally assumes the establishment of\ngoals, standards, criteria, and/or guidelines against which local transit results can be assessed, as well as a\nreliable data reporting system to support the program. Typical groupings of performance measures include cost\nefficiency, cost effectiveness, service utilization and/or effectiveness, vehicle utilization and/or efficiency,\nservice quality, labor productivity, and service accessibility.\nViews of performance-based allocation, specific measures to be applied, and how results are calculated vary\ntremendously. At the same time, the role of the funding body--state or regional--also varies considerably, from\na direct, ownership position to arms-length grant programs. State interests in ensuring transit service also vary,\nbut often relate to providing citizens with mobility, facilitating economic development, and achieving\nenvironmental goals.\nTwo questionnaires were used: one for funding agencies and one for funding recipients. The survey results\nshow how performance measures are related to financing transit.\n\nFor the most part, state funding organizations have established measures to use in assessing or monitoring local transit\nsystems. The criteria usually relate to ridership and cost efficiency, while quality-of-life factors are rarely referenced. Few\norganizations provide financial assistance based exclusively on performance factors. When performance is used, it is often\ncombined with nonperformance components. According to the survey results, funding agencies most commonly rely on formulas\nmade up of factors that do not consider performance. Others rely on formulas made up of factors that combine performance\nrelated (e.g., passengers per total vehicle miles) and nonperformance related elements (e.g., population). Next most common are\nprograms of discretionary grants with some sort of upper limit. Almost all funding agencies typically maintain performance data\non transit systems and use the information for program management and planning purposes exclusively or in connection with\ngrant activities, as indicated above. There is widespread feeling that allocations based strictly on performance measures result in\ninherent inequities.\nAlthough half of the funding entity respondents believe performance allocation can result in performance improvements, few\nfunding recipients agree. The state departments of transportation that currently do not use performance factors in making local\ngrants and that do not intend to do so anytime soon cited the lack of political support, low funding levels, and satisfaction with\nexisting methods as their reasons. The factors most commonly used in performance-based allocation systems were ridership per\npopulation and ridership per expense.\nCase studies were conducted for the funding allocation systems used by three states. The three states--Pennsylvania, Indiana,\nand Texas--were selected primarily because of the diversity of their approaches.\nIn the past, Pennsylvania used a system of allocation with a strong performance component. Performance improvements\nresulted in a bonus that increased the state share of subsidy. This system has been replaced by one that relies to a much more\nmodest degree on performance factors. Pennsylvania Department of Transportation staff have expressed concern that\nperformance related systems can neglect the real issues of need and of differences in local funding capacities. They view\nperformance rather than base subsidy as a more appropriate means of distributing incentive funding.\nIndiana supports local transit systems with a guaranteed minimum level of aid. Additional funding is awarded according to a\nformula that places a great deal of weight on local financial assistance.\nThe Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) recently departed from a formula allocation that relied on demographic\nand performance factors. The new funding mechanism is based on a percentage of available state funding. Performance\ninformation is tracked, but it is generally reviewed separately as a program management function.\nKey conclusions of this synthesis are as follows:\n-\nThere continues to be a great diversity of opinion and approaches to the use of performance-based funding systems for\npublic transportation by states and regional funding entities.\n-\nThere is a lack of clear-cut goals established for transit in many states.\n-\nSome funding organizations find themselves struggling with conflicts between their concerns for quality and quantity\nof transit service provided and the need to respond to legislative and taxpayer demands to constrain expenditures.\n-\nThere is widespread agreement among state departments of transportation and regional funding bodies like\nmetropolitan planning organizations (MPOs) that local transit system performance should be tracked. Fewer agree that the\nresults should guide financial subsidy decisions, and even fewer are doing it. Some of the related findings, candidly\nexpressed by professionals in funding and recipient agencies, include the following:\n-\nIt is difficult to reach consensus on what constitutes good performance, especially in light of the broad-based goals\nfor transit funding assistance.\n-\nIt is difficult to determine whether performance-based financial assistance should go to the good performers or the\npoor performers who may have greater financial needs.\n\n-\nFunding agency decisionmakers remain skeptical of the reliability of data provided by many local authorities;\nthere is concern that information can be skewed deliberately or inadvertently to meet benchmarks.\n-\nThere is doubt as to whether performance measurement systems can truly be sensitive to the differences among\ntransit systems; at the same time, external factors beyond the control of transit managers can also unbalance the playing\nfield.\n-\nThe influence of politics at state and local levels remains formidable, sometimes driving funding or operational\ndecisions regardless of performance results.\n-\nFunding agency staff are reluctant to apply the financial penalties to local transit systems that might be dictated by\nperformance-based decisions.\n-\nPerformance-based funding may not respond appropriately to the competing pressures on public transit systems to\ntake a hard-nosed business approach to service while also fulfilling their social mission.\n-\nWhen performance components are used in subsidy allocation formulas, they tend to be combined with\nnonperformance factors or factors not traditionally viewed as performance characteristics, such as local financial\ncontribution levels.\n-\nTwo movements seem to be occurring among state departments of transportation that include performance measures in\ntheir allocation formulas:\n-\nPerformance measurement is being used to provide an incentive level of funding rather than as a determinant of\nbase allocations.\n-\nPerformance-based measures are being eliminated from their allocation systems entirely.\n-\nSome state departments of transportation and MPOs have considered performance measurement and performance-\nbased allocation of financial aid. But they recognize that developing appropriate measures and allocation mechanisms that\nare responsive is no small task. At a minimum, it requires the active participation of transit systems and local and state\nlegislative bodies.\nFurther research on the methods used to allocate transit operating funds, particularly performance-based systems, is\nrecommended. The research should explore the applicability and appropriateness of different types of performance measures to\ndifferent types of transit systems; and it should examine successful and less successful efforts by transit agencies to control or\nreduce operating expenses, while maintaining a locally appropriate level of transit service.\n\nCHAPTER ONE\nINTRODUCTION\nThe measurement of performance has always been an important\nconcern in the transit community. While abundant research is\ndevoted to ways to measure performance, a whole different set of\nissues arise with respect to the use of performance data. How to use\nperformance information in a way that compares transit systems but\nthat still recognizes the vast differences among them in geography,\nvehicle fleet, modes of service, population, land use and density\ncharacteristics, and even meteorological conditions remains open to\nquestion. These issues are of particular concern as states and other\npublic funding entities search for ways to provide equitable financial\nassistance to local transit operations.\nAs urban transit moved from being a creature of private\nenterprise to one of public service, the influx of public dollars\nimposed new pressures to demonstrate that taxpayers were indeed\ngetting a return for their dollars. As the gap between fares collected\nfrom customers and total annual expenditures grew over the past two\ndecades, transit systems increasingly have had to demonstrate fiscal\nresponsibility and accountability.\nAlthough the level of federal transit investment for capital\npurposes has generally risen, federal involvement in operating costs\nhas remained relatively constant in absolute dollars, and inflation has\nreduced the actual buying power. Further, with limited degrees of\nsuccess, presidential administrations since 1980, including the\npresent one, have recommended the elimination or reduction of U.S.\nDepartment of Transportation operating aid programs for public\ntransportation. State governments, regional entities, and local\ngovernments have stepped in to cover the decline (See Figure 1.) In\nparticular, this represents the importance of operating assistance,\nespecially to small- and mid-sized communities\nAs the level of nonfederal contributions to transit rises, state,\nregional, and local agencies are challenged to justify the benefits of\nthese expenditures. They must answer questions about what these\ndollars are buying and about whether they are buying what the\ngovernment set out to achieve with its transit programs in the first\nplace. Without dedicated funding, funds for state and local subsidies\nmust increasingly compete with other demands on government for\nsocial service, education, other public works, and economic\ndevelopment investment.\nIn the course of these funding debates, the use of performance-based\nallocation methods as one means to justify transit financial assistance\nis frequently noted. More specifically, the question is raised as to\nhow these data can be used to determine how much each recipient\nshould actually get. Transit performance measures may offer the\nopportunity to manage and monitor more effectively, as well as to\nprovide necessary information for public accountability.\nThe literature includes many definitions for performance and\nfor performance measurement. For the purposes of this report, those\ndefinitions have been amalgamated into the following:\nPerformance measurement is the assessment of an\norganization's output as a product of the management\nof its internal resources (dollars, people, vehicles, facilities) and\nthe environment in which it operates.\nThe arguments over transit performance measurements in general\nand the role performance measures should play in the allocation of\ntransit operating funds in particular are complex, with strongly held\nviews on all sides. The debate has emerged in professional\nconferences and journals, within Congress and state legislatures, and\nacross the boardrooms of transit agencies and metropolitan planning\norganizations (MPOs). It has evoked dissenting views from\nmanagement and labor; local, state, and federal officials; and\nacademicians and practitioners. But even within these individual\ngroups, there has been no uniform agreement about the appropriate\nform and role of performance measures.\nThere are a number of dimensions to the debate. Issues center\non the ability of agencies to do the following:\n-\nProvide accurate definitions of good performance,\n-\nEstablish appropriate sets of measurements and standards\nthat accurately depict performance levels,\nFIGURE 1\nTransit Funding Sources (Source. American Public\nTransit Association.)\n\n-\nCompare\ntransit\norganizations\nwith\nvastly\ndiffering characteristics,\n-\nSecure reliable data.\n-\nLive with the financial impacts that performance-\nbased programs may yield, and\n-\nDeal with the intrusion of political concerns into\nthe process.\nIf there is a common theme, it is that any evaluation of\na transit agency and its services should consider its\nindividual operations and objectives as well as its external\nenvironment. At the same time, it is important to assess the\noverall performance of the organization by groups of\nindicators that together paint a more complete picture.\nMost do agree that the demands on transit have\nchanged over the past 20 years and continue to change, as\nhave the constituencies. The people who care about transit\ninclude not only its customers, but also employers who\nneed to comply with Clean Air Act restrictions, motorists\nwho are no longer allowed to ride alone in their cars on all\nlanes of the expressway, and people with disabilities who\nmay have never before entered a subway station. At the\nsame time, transit is being promoted as a means for\neconomic development from downtown areas, where it is\nbeing used to enhance circulation, to rural areas, where it is\nbeing used to move visitors to and through recreational and\ntourist attractions. These and other new constituencies are\nbringing new agendas and new yardsticks against which to\nmeasure transit performance--usually ambitious, sometimes\nunrealistic, and sometimes contradictory. Most agree,\nhowever, that transit can no longer measure its\nachievements with respect to how it operated and the goals\nset out for it a generation ago.\nSYNTHESIS FOCUS\nThis synthesis focuses primarily on the relationship\nbetween states and the public transit systems that they fund.\nAn effort was also made to examine the relationship\nbetween regional bodies and local transit providers. This\nstudy\nis\ndesigned\nto\nprovide\ninformation\nabout\nperformance-based funding allocation methods used by\nstates The practical application of these indicators in\nselected case studies is discussed, and the value and\neffectiveness of the programs is assessed, from the\nperspectives of funding agencies and fund recipients\nInformation\non\nperformance\nmeasures\nand\nperformance-based allocation methods was obtained\nthrough a variety of means. First, the existing literature was\nreviewed The body of information reviewed reflected the\nperspectives\nof\nacademicians;\ngovernment\nfunding\nagencies at the federal, state, and local levels; and transit\nagencies.\nSecond, a detailed questionnaire was sent to 56\norganizations. The recipients included state departments of\ntransportation of varying sizes, transit operators in urban\nand rural areas, and regional funding entities. Agencies\nwith and without performance-\nbased funding systems were included in the survey\npopulation to learn about the distribution formulas they use\nand to ascertain why they do not use performance-based\nfunding. Of the 56 surveys mailed, 25 were completed and\nreturned. Telephone follow-up calls were then made to\ngather information. The results tend to represent the views\nand procedures of state departments of transportation and\nlocal transit systems more so than regional bodies like\nMPOs. Comments from many of the states and transit\nsystems indicate that regional bodies play less of a role in\nthe distribution of operating funds in most metropolitan\nareas. There are some notable exceptions to this, such as\nthe San Francisco area.\nIt is also important to keep the overall survey response\nrate (45 percent) in mind. The results and conclusions\npresented in this synthesis are based solely on that\nresponse. This effort was never designed to be a\nstatistically valid sample of transit funding organizations\nand transit operating organizations; rather, this synthesis is\nbased on what these respondents believe and what they are\ndoing.\nThird, case studies were undertaken with states that\nuse differing applications of performance-based funding\narrangements. Case studies within each state included\ninterviews with both the primary funding agency and one\nof its grant recipients so that differing perspectives on the\nsame allocation method could be explored.\nFor the purpose of this synthesis, it is important to\nstress that the review was confined to performance-based\napproaches related to operating assistance programs.\nAlthough programs that fund both operating and capital\nneeds of transit agencies were considered, plans that\nprovided capital dollars only were not included in the\nsurvey results or in the analysis.\nSYNTHESIS ORGANIZATION\nThis synthesis is organized into six chapters.\n1.\nThis introduction composes the first chapter.\nChapter\n2,\n\"Challenges\nin\nthe\nUse\nof\nPerformance Measures,\" provides an overview of the\npurposes of performance measures.\nChapter 3, \"The Role of State, Regional, and\nLocal Governments in Assisting Local Transit Services,\"\ndiscusses the role of those entities in transit operations and\nthe reasons for that involvement.\n4.\nChapter 4, \"Survey Results,\" reviews the purpose\nof the survey, research methodology used, populations\nsurveyed, and nature of the instrument The chapter also\nincludes an analysis and interpretation of results.\n5.\nChapter 5, \"Case Studies,\" describes the funding\nallocation systems in the states of Texas and Indiana and\nthe Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and provides the\nrationale for each.\n6.\nChapter 6, \"Conclusions and Recommendations\nfor Further Research,\" offers conclusions from the\nsynthesis, as well as recommendations for further research\nrelated to performance-based funding\n\nCHAPTER TWO\nCHALLENGES IN THE USE OF PERFORMANCE MEASURES\nThe measurement of transit performance has been, and will\ncontinue to be, an important concern for funding bodies and transit\nagencies. As operating costs escalate at faster rates than operating\nrevenue, and as federal operating assistance (in current dollars)\ndeclines, the financial burden placed on state, regional, and local\ngovernment units is becoming heavy. The money state and local\ntransportation agencies spend on transit must yield a return not only\nin the form of productive and effective services, but also in\naccomplishing the programmatic goals that drive governments into\nthe transit subsidy business in the first place Transit performance\nmeasures can offer an opportunity to establish this accountability.\nMuch of the available literature deals with the establishment of\nappropriate performance measures and what they can be expected to\ndo. In fact, the literature is rich with categorized lists of various\nperformance measures, as well as careful distinctions between\nefficiency and effectiveness assessments. Because there is such a\nwealth of material available through other sources, this synthesis\ngenerally has avoided this kind of exposition, except in the most\ncursory fashion. Instead, this report focuses on the use of\nperformance information in practical day-to-day transit support\ndecisions. There is less discussion of that in the literature. As an\nexample, many of the common measures cited by theorists were not\nused by any of the survey respondents\nIt should also be noted that this synthesis avoids any value\njudgments on \"good\" performance versus \"bad\" performance or the\nuse of benchmarks that can be used as norms. This follows many of\nthe comments received in connection with the surveys, which\ncontend that \"good\" and \"bad\" or \"effectiveness\" and \"efficiency\"\ncan only be defined for a particular transit system or group of transit\nsystems, when local conditions and circumstances are taken into\naccount.\nGENERAL DISCUSSION ON PERFORMANCE\nMEASUREMENT\nSimply put, the purpose of any performance-based allocation\nprocedure is to give agencies of all sizes incentives to improve\nperformance. Implicit in the concept of performance evaluation is the\nnotion that performance must be tracked against some previously\nestablished standard, goal, or guideline, or some other measure of\npast performance. A system of reward needs to be designed to serve\nas an incentive to move performance toward whatever is considered a\ndesirable result or set of achievements This line of reasoning leads to\nwhat may be--at least in theory--the most basic reason for state,\nregional, or local agencies to employ performance-based funding.\nThere are many reasons for these agencies to assist local transit\noperations. It may be to offer mobility for those who do not have it or\nhave it in a limited way. It may be part of a strategy to improve\nenvironmental quality. It may be a tool in the state's efforts to\nstrengthen economic development. In any event, understanding why\na state has enacted a transit subsidy program helps to target\nfunding through performance assessment of local agencies that are\ndoing the most to achieve the state's transit investment goals.\nGiven this rationale and depending on the form of the transit\noperating guidelines and standards, the literature suggests that\nperformance measurement and evaluation may be used for the\nfollowing:\n-\nAs\naids\nfor\nassessing\nmanagement\nperformance\nexpectations of the transit system in relation to community\nobjectives;\n-\nAs mechanisms for assessing management performance\nand diagnosing problems, such as disproportionate cost in\nrelation to service;\n-\nAs methods to allocate resources among competing transit\nproperties, on the basis of relative cost effectiveness or other\ncriteria; and\n-\nAs management and monitoring tools to facilitate\ncontinued and improved performance by management and\npersonnel, perhaps accompanied by a program of technical\nassistance.\nPerformance indicators can serve in one or more of these roles.\n\"The overall significant feature of indicators is the identification and\nillumination of management actions and results to provide both\nincreased public involvement and understanding and improved\nefficiency and effectiveness through better management\" (1)\nPerformance in general terms refers to any evaluation or\ncomparison measure. Specific measures that define performance\ninclude effectiveness, efficiency, impact, productivity, and quality of\nservice. Each of these measures has certain indicators that are used to\nsignify transit performance for each particular measure.\nA review of the literature on transit performance reveals that\nnot all agencies use the same terms for performance measures. Some\nuse the terms efficiency or effectiveness\nIn Managing Public Transit Strategically: A Comprehensive\nApproach to Strengthening Service and Monitoring Performance,\nGordon J. Fielding explores the concept of performance indicators\nto monitor performance.\nFielding asserts that \"A small set of diagnostic indicators that\ntrack an agency's performance over time, as well as compare it with\nthat of its peers, can be as useful for transit management as the Dunn\nand Bradstreet industry norms are for private firms.\" He adds that\n\"These indicators may not capture every activity of an agency, but\nthey do indicate progress in key areas\" (2)\nPublic transit agencies used to gauge their success by the\nnumber of riders rather than by cost. Privately owned transit agencies\nalso gauged success by ridership--but only because their fares\nreflected marginal costs. Input costs--labor, fuel, and equipment-\nwere relatively stable, and costs were controlled by cutting service on\nroutes where revenue fell below marginal costs Marginal cost pricing\nwas abandoned when government subsidies became available Many\ntransit authorities lowered fares, expanded routes, and paid less\nattention to the cost of delivering\n\nservice. Meanwhile, the industry has continued to assess\nperformance in terms of ridership\nClearly, traditional definitions of performance are changing\nas rapidly as the role of transit, as discussed earlier. A good\nexample is Vice President Al Gore's initiatives to \"reinvent\ngovernment \" A fundamental concept in his work is that\ngovernment needs to be measured by different yardsticks.\nResponsiveness to customers remains a relatively new measure\nthat holds enormous implications for changing the ways in which\ntransit funding agencies and local authorities think about and\nmeasure what they do.\nEFFICIENCY AND EFFECTIVENESS MEASURES\nService input, output, and consumption figures measure three\nimportant\ndimensions\nof\ntransit\noperations:\nefficiency,\neffectiveness, and overall performance.\nAccording to Fielding, efficiency describes how well factors\nsuch as labor, equipment, facilities, and fuel are used to produce\noutputs as represented by vehicle hours or miles of service.\nEffectiveness measures transit's consumption of traffic congestion.\nOverall\nperformance\nindicators\nintegrate\nefficiency\nand\neffectiveness measures, as when costs of service inputs are related\nto consumption. Examples are cost per passenger and the ratio of\nrevenue to the cost of producing service. Fielding's interpretation\ntends to represent the \"orthodoxy\" of thought regarding efficiency\nand effectiveness. This traditional view, however, is broadened by\nmore contemporary views.\nTransit management is responsible for achieving efficiency\nand is held accountable for it Effectiveness, as Fielding points out,\nis more difficult to evaluate. In fact, many transportation\nprofessionals are quick to point out that it is the external factors, or\nthose beyond the manager's control, that make up the largest\ndeterminant of the public transportation performance profile. For\nexample, inflation, unemployment, development patterns, and\npolitically based decisions on issues such as route alignment, fares,\nservices, and hours, all weigh heavily on transit utilization and\ntransit costs.\nTherefore, states choosing to use performance-based\nmeasurements in their funding allocation formulas must make\ncertain they properly distinguish efficiency from effectiveness and\nlikewise do not penalize transit systems for not achieving\nperformance goals that are outside the traditional circle of\nmanagement influence.\nAPPLYING PERFORMANCE MEASURES\nTransit performance measures are applicable to both internal\nand external purposes.\nInternally, transit performance measures can be used to\nascertain progress toward transit service goals and objectives, to\nassist in evaluating the transit system's overall performance, and to\nprovide a management control system for monitoring and\nimproving transit services.\nExternally, transit performance measures can facilitate the\naccountability sought by government funding agencies and\ndemanded by legislators, regional and transit authority boards, and\nthe general public. External performance factors enable public\nofficials to compare the goals government has established for\nmeeting community transportation needs with the actual results of\nefforts directed toward meeting those goals As such, these\nperformance indicators normally reflect a systemwide level of\nperformance.\nPerformance-based measurements should be appropriate to\nthe situation they are assessing, and transit systems should be\ncomparable so that valid comparisons between systems can be\nmade. This point is addressed in an analysis of performance\nmeasures prepared by Dave N. Carter and Timothy J. Lomax in\nTransportation Research Record 1338 (3). As an example, Carter\nand Lomax assert that significant service and demographic\ndifferences between rural and urban transit systems should be\nconsidered when developing appropriate planning and evaluation\ntechniques. Some such differences are as follows:\n-\nRural transit providers operate over vast geographic\nexpanses that tend to have low populations.\n-\nResidents of rural areas generally have lower income\nlevels than their urban counterparts.\n-\nRural transit providers often do not operate a fixed-\nroute service. Operations are usually demand-\nresponsive or subscription service.\n-\nThe objectives of rural systems are more concerned\nwith providing transportation to transit-dependent\ngroups (e g., elderly, youth, low income, handicapped)\nthan with reducing traffic congestion.\nBut even these factors are considered by some to be\ngeneralizations. The advent of new transit requests, such as high-\ncapacity service demands for recreational areas (e.g., ski resorts in\nVermont), blur the urban/rural line to some extent. The pace of\ndevelopment in suburban and rural areas has also modified these\ndistinctions\nCarter and Lomax identify three elements--demographic\nfactors, service descriptors, and performance indicators--as\nnecessary to compare transit service fairly. Peer groups may be\nused for service comparison if transit agencies have significantly\ndifferent operations or service area characteristics. Transit\nproviders should be compared with similar agencies. Care should\nbe taken when determining peer groups and what constitutes a\n\"similar\" agency. Simply categorizing agencies by operation or\nmodal group (e.g., fixed-route, demand responsive) may not\nprovide fair comparisons because demographic and service\ncharacteristics may vary within these groups. Service area size,\npopulation characteristics, climatic conditions, and service\nobjectives may also need to be considered when evaluating or\ncomparing agencies.\nDemographic factors (e.g., service area size, population),\nwhich describe the inherent characteristics of a service area, can be\nused to establish peer groups for comparison Service descriptors\nindicate the quantity of service provided, such as total vehicle\nmiles of travel or passengers They do not give an indication of\nefficiency, effectiveness, impact, or quality. Therefore, they should\nnot be considered performance indicators. Although these\ndescriptors may show the quantity of service provided, they do not\nindicate the quality of service provided. Performance indicators, in\ncontrast, can measure the efficiency, effectiveness, impact, or\nquality of transit service.\nCarter and Lomax formulated the following chart of\nperformance measures and indicators to assist in selecting\nappropriate measures and indicators for assessing and comparing\nsystems\nPerformance Measure\nPerformance Indicators\nCost Efficiency\nCost per mile\nCost per hour\nCost per vehicle\nRidership per expense\ncontinued\n\n(continued)\nPerformance Measure\nPerformance Indicators\nCost Effectiveness\nCost per passenger trip\nRevenue per passenger trip\nRidership per expense\nService\nUtilization/Effectiveness\nPassenger trips per mile\nPassenger trips per hour\nPassenger trips per capita\nVehicle\nUtilization/Efficiency\nMiles per vehicle\nQuality of Service\nAverage speed\nVehicle miles between road\ncalls\nVehicle miles between\naccidents\nLabor Productivity\nPassenger trips per employee\nVehicle miles per employee\nCoverage\nVehicle miles per capita\nVehicle miles per service\nA more contemporary view of performance measurement and\nfunding is addressed by David Osborne and Ted Gaebler in their\nrecent book, Reinventing Government, How the Entrepreneurial\nSpirit is Transforming the Public Sector. Osborne and Gaebler\nindicate that service agencies (e.g, transit agencies, hospitals) focus\non\ninputs\ninstead\nof\noutcomes\n\"Traditional\nbureaucratic\ngovernments fund schools based on how many children enroll;\nwelfare based on how many poor people are eligible; police\ndepartments based on manpower needed to fight crime.\"\nGovernments, the authors assert, \"pay little attention to outcomes-\nresults.\" Entrepreneurial governments seek to change these\nrewards and incentive structures. Public entrepreneurs know that\nwhen institutions are funded according to inputs, they have little\nreason to strive for better performance. But when they are funded\naccording to outcomes, they become obsessive over performance\n(4).\nThe authors assert that today's citizens \"refuse to pay higher\ntaxes for services whose prices skyrocket while their quality\ndeclines As a result, words like accountability, performance, and\nresults have begun to ring through the halls of government (and\npublic service agencies).\"\nWith respect to efficiency and effectiveness, and how\ngovernment (service industries) tends to deal with them, they note,\n\"When we measure efficiency, we know how much it is costing us\nto achieve a specific output. When we measure effectiveness, we\nknow whether our investment is worthwhile.\"\nOsborne and Gaebler recognize that efficiency and\neffectiveness are important But when public organizations begin to\nmeasure their performance, they often measure only their\nefficiency The public, the authors assert, \"certainly wants efficient\ngovernment, but it wants effective government even more.\" For\nexample, citizens may be pleased that they enjoy a low tax rate, but\nif that means they spend an hour getting to work on clogged\nhighways, they may vote to invest in a more effective\ntransportation system.\nApplying Osborne and Gaebler's concept to public\ntransportation illustrates one of the challenges associated with the\nuse of appropriate performance measures because they may be\nrelied on to accommodate the different institutional perspectives of\ntransit. Specifically, funding agencies, concerned with the ever-\nincreasing\nlevels of assistance requested of them, focus their attention on\naggregate systemwide productivity. Transit passengers are\nconcerned with fare levels and the quality of transit service, which\noften requires greater expenditures.\nRESPONDENTS' PERSPECTIVE\nIn carrying out the research plan for this synthesis, a process\nwas established, which began with the literature search The\nprevious section conveyed a modest sense of this The literature\noverview is followed by the questionnaire results--a series of\nformal answers describing how performance measures are or are\nnot being put to use in the course of making decisions on the\nallocation of funds The process concludes with follow-up\ndiscussion--primarily telephone calls to respondents and case study\npreparations It was through these activities that the most pragmatic\nevaluation of performance data begins to emerge And, at the end of\nthis process from the highly theoretical to the very candid, the view\nof most of the practitioners who participated in this synthesis in\nsome way is that it is very difficult, if not impossible, to make\nperformance-based allocation work in the real world of\nintergovernmental relationships.\nThe survey found that no funding organization was basing its\nsubsidy allocation decisions completely on performance related\ninformation Some were using it in part, some were stretching\ntraditional definitions of performance, and some were not using it\nat all or were even abandoning previous efforts.\nWhen respondents were questioned further in telephone\nconversations, comments were generally consistent People agree\nthat performance for allocation purposes is widely discussed, but\nthat little real decision making is associated with it.\nPerformance is hard to measure because there is no clear\nagreement on what constitutes good performance. The survey\nfound that few funding organizations had set specific goals for\nassisting transit beyond the almost universal goals of mobility,\neconomic development, and a cleaner environment. It is difficult to\nestablish benchmarks for broad objectives like these For example,\nwhat is the performance measure to accompany a general\nenvironmental goal.\nEven if good performance is carefully defined and\nappropriate measures are crafted, some question where the funding\nshould go--to the good performers as a reward, or to the poorer\nperformers who still are meeting transportation needs Also,\nfunding organizations and fund recipients have their own ideas\nabout what should be built, where, and what service should be\noperated\nOnce performance definition and benchmarking occur,\nperformance allocations require a strong system of information\ncollection Candidly, many state department of transportation\nmanagers admit that the data they collect from funding recipients\nare simply unreliable--subject to efforts and inconsistencies,\nsometimes inadvertent and sometimes deliberate They believe the\nproverbial notion that one can prove anything with statistics--that\ndata can be directed to portray a favorable picture of any aspect of\nperformance that will be rewarded. The level of effort involved in\nvalidating reported information is sometimes beyond the funding\nagency's capabilities and resources\nEven assuming the data are reported and collected in good\nfaith, differences in definitions and characteristics of recipients\ncomplicate the problem A good example relates to passengers per\nmile--one fairly common measure of performance In a community\nwith higher densities and corridor-oriented land use patterns,\n\nthe number is likely to be high. More people will ride shorter\ndistances. In a suburban or semi-rural environment, however,\nfewer people will ride longer distances, resulting in fewer\npassengers per mile How does the performance-measuring\nfunding agency handle that? Certainly, different benchmarks\ncan be established for different categories of communities.\nBut cities have not developed to please our definitions, and\nwhere the definitional lines get drawn can result in arbitrary\nfunding disparities.\nEven when measures are carefully laid out and\npainstakingly defined, recipients may still use statistics to\npaint the desired picture, according to the survey respondents.\nThis may be a cynical view, but it was expressed by many.\nThe subject of politics came up a great deal in the course\nof the informal discussions. No respondent expounded on it\nin their questionnaire response, but many insisted privately\nthat despite all the good academic writing about\nperformance-based allocations, senior executive staff and\nelected officials often have their own ideas about which\nentities should get the money. Communities with political\nclout tend to deliver that help. Even staff who feel\nempowered to make changes indicate they are reluctant to do\nso.\nThe case is especially evident for agencies not currently\nusing a performance-based approach (which is most), but\nconsidering moving to one. Converting to a financial\nassistance system that relies on performance results means\nwinners and losers. Naturally, some recipients will get more\nand some will get less in that conversion Everyone loves a\nwinner, but staff suggest that the political climate does not\ntolerate losers. Perhaps this explains why steps toward\nperformance-based funding have often included hold-\nharmless and grand-fathering protection and why incentive\npayments are often used only after a base amount of funding\nhas been paid out\nSome transit officials, in particular, concede that the\nspecter of financing tied to performance criteria is simply a\nploy to reduce public investment under the guise of efficient\ngovernment Just as some funding agency staff believe that\nrecipients can skew data to provide a rosier picture of results,\nsome recipients believe that those who make grants can skew\nperformance assessments to reduce the flow of funds. This\nconcern notwithstanding, not a single funding recipient\nagency that responded to the survey reported any loss of\nsubsidy because of the application of performance-based\nevaluations.\nFinally, there are those who express discomfort with the\nnotion of performance-based funding because it is viewed as\nan inappropriate business approach. This argument validates\nsome of the observations noted earlier by Osborne and\nGaebler Because public transportation is a public service and\nno longer a privately sponsored business venture, it must\nprovide many functions that\nare simply not productive. Door-to-door service for people\nwith disabilities, service to a senior citizen complex that is far\nfrom any heavily traveled corridor, or owl bus service for a\nsmall number of riders who have no alternatives are likely to\nskew performance measures in a negative direction. But these\nmay be trips that the operator is required to provide by public\npolicy or legislation. As long as similar services are offered\nby all recipients, performance measures can still be evenly\napplied. If, however, one transit organization provides more\nof these services than its peers, then performance-based\nfunding may not offer an equitable allocation mechanism\nPERFORMANCE INFORMATION FOR\nMONITORING\nWhether or not performance information is used to grant\nfinancial assistance, most state and regional funding bodies\nwant and use the data, at a minimum, to monitor how\ntransportation organizations are faring\nMany states, transit authorities, transit districts, and\nregional authorities publish an annual comparative review of\nperformance\nindicators,\neffectiveness\nmeasures,\nand\nefficiency measures for the transit systems for which they are\nfinancially or programmatically responsible. These reports\nare generally similar in content and provide graphic statistical\ninformation on annual transit system performance. While\nsome publications only report trends in selected measures,\nmany of these annual publications contain comparative\nanalyses illustrating the performance of comparable transit\noperations. The 1992 Performance Evaluations of Florida\nTransit Systems, prepared for the Office of Public\nTransportation Operations of the Florida Department of\nTransportation, is such a report.\nThe evaluation measures that are used through this\nperformance-based report are divided into three major\ncategories: performance indicators, effectiveness measures,\nand efficiency measures. Performance indicators report the\ndata in the selected categories that are required by the Federal\nTransit Administration's Section 15 document. (To receive\nfederal funds, transit properties are required to report a\nvariety of data in a standardized format, resulting in the\nSection 15 report.) These tend to be key indicators of overall\nsystem performance. Effectiveness measures typically refine\nthe data further and indicate the extent to which various\nservice-related goals are being achieved.\nAppendix A lists the indicators and measures that the\nFlorida Department of Transportation annually assembles to\nassess the transit services it funds. This is a comprehensive\nlisting of measures, indicative of the measures used to assess\nthe performance of transit systems throughout the country. A\ndefinition of these measures can also be found in Appendix A\n\nCHAPTER THREE\nTHE ROLE OF STATE, REGIONAL, AND LOCAL\nGOVERNMENTS IN ASSISTING LOCAL\nTRANSIT SERVICES\nState, regional, and local involvement in public transit is as\nvaried as the types of transit systems that serve the nation's\ncommunities. Some states and metropolitan planning organizations\n(MPOs) have a long history of financial investment in public\ntransportation, predating the earliest federal legislation in 1964.\nOther states and MPOs are more recent entries, and others have yet\nto support transit in any meaningful way.\nIn some states, transit is operated by state government, with\nprimary funding and overall direction from the state government.\nDelaware, Connecticut, Maryland, and to a large extent New Jersey\nfall into this category. In other states, transit agencies are not directly\na part of state government, but they were created by state legislative\naction The Metropolitan Transportation Authority serving the New\nYork area represents this type of organization. Some transit systems\nare regional authorities or departments of municipal government, but\nstill benefit from state funding support\nState departments of transportation are by far the most\nprevalent agencies nationwide to allocate transit operating and capital\nfunding to transit agencies. Although the survey sample did include\nMPOs, only one MPO--the Metropolitan Transportation Commission\n(MTC) in the San Francisco Bay area of California--indicated that it\nannually allocates funds to transit agencies The predominant role of\nMPOs regarding federal operating and capital planning funds relates\nto the responsibility for assembling the annual Transportation\nImprovement Program (TIP)--a federal requirement for federal fund\neligibility.\nMTC, however, does allocate federal, state, and regional\nfunding for transit operating and capital purposes, performing two\nfunctions in this regard. First, it determines fund eligibility for\nprospective recipients Second, it allocates funds to urban, small\nurban, and rural transit systems in northern California.\nMTC applies several factors to calculate allocation levels for\nthese transit systems, including service area population, funding level\nrequired to sustain core transit service, and farebox recovery ratio-\nthe only performance measure used.\nIn many places it is easy to see why the state is a leading\nsponsor of transit services Before federal legislation was enacted,\nfailing private transit systems could turn only to local or state\ngovernment, and frequently it was the state government that had the\nresources to help. For many urban areas, where consolidated transit\nnetworks serve a region including the central city and surrounding\nsuburban counties, the state was the public body that could operate\nacross municipal borders In rural areas, service usually operates\noutside any incorporated communities and across many counties.\nUsing general funds, social service funds, and dedicated taxes, the\nstate could effectively become the financial provider.\nIt is important not only to recognize the role of state\ngovernment in regard to transit, but to also understand why states,\nlocal\njurisdictions, and MPOs support transit and continue to provide\nincreasing financial assistance for transit systems.\nINTEREST IN SUPPORTING TRANSIT\nStates are a major source of funding for public transit, and their\ngeneral support of transit is founded in mobility, economic\ndevelopment, and environmental benefits.\nMobility\nWith the passage of the Intermodal Surface Transportation\nEfficiency Act (ISTEA) of 1991 and the Clean Air Act Amendments\nof 1990, states are being required to establish a transportation system\nthat is balanced, efficient, and intermodal. A balanced transportation\nsystem relies on transit, as well as highways, with the classic goal of\nmoving people rather than vehicles. It improves mobility and makes\ntravel more efficient in terms of travel time, use of resources, energy\nconservation, and benefits to the environment.\nState and local jurisdictions traditionally have been concerned\nwith the mobility needs of citizens. In urban areas, state and local\njurisdictions have increased their transit contributions to ensure\npeople without access to automobiles can get to jobs, schools, and\nother basic destinations In rural areas, states have responded to\ntransit needs that may be smaller but are often more critical, because\nno options exist for some citizens to get to jobs, schools, stores,\nmedical care, and social services.\nEconomic Development\nIn addition to improving mobility, the transit infrastructure in\nurban and rural areas also stimulates economic development and\nimproves the performance and value of the transit system. It enables\npeople to efficiently commute to congested work areas, such as the\ncentral business district or emerging suburban edge cities.\nConsequently, the highway system functions more effectively.\nTransit also provides \"reverse commute\" opportunities: individuals\nliving in central cities can seek employment in the burgeoning\nsuburban employment centers. Transit stimulates and supports\neconomic development in cities, as well as in suburban and rural\nareas.\nTransit brings with it the potential for more concentrated and\ntherefore more efficient development. In dense urbanized areas, rapid\ntransit stations provide opportunities for concentrated office, retail,\nand service development. The construction of office and commercial\nfacilities, for instance, adjacent to the Washington, D C, Metrorail\nstations illustrates the benefits to local and regional economy--more\njobs, additional taxable income, and increased property tax revenue.\n\nEnvironmental Benefits\ntransit system can make contributions toward improving\nthe environment and assisting in meeting federal\nIn recent years, transit has been called on to contribute\nenvironmental mandates, thus elevating itself in the\nto improving air quality in many major urban centers. An\nhierarchy of funding decisions\neffective\n\nCHAPTER FOUR\nSURVEY RESULTS\nMETHODOLOGY\nTwo survey instruments were developed for this study. One\nversion was sent to funding agencies; the other was sent to fund\nrecipients. (See Appendix C for copies of each version.) Although\nsome of the questions were specifically tailored to funding agencies\nor fund recipients, they addressed similar aspects of performance-\nbased allocations. This allowed for the comparison of perspectives\nand attitudes among the survey populations. Both surveys were\ndesigned to\n-\nObtain an overview of the performance-based funding\nsystems that are practiced by various funding agencies,\n-\nObtain assessments of whether the use of performance-\nbased allocations is meeting intended objectives,\n-\nHighlight\nthe\nadvantages\nand\ndisadvantages\nof\nperformance-based allocation systems from the perspectives of\nfunding agencies and fund recipients,\n-\nProvide information about specific transit funding\nallocation approaches, and\n-\nElicit opinions on the use of performance-based measures\nas a fund-allocation method.\nQuestionnaires were sent to 56 organizations that included state\ndepartments of transportation of various sizes, transit operators, and\nother funding entities. Recipients were selected based on their\ndocumented experience or interest in performance-based funding, the\nliterature search, and the personal knowledge of the advisory panel\nmembers. Agencies without performance-based funding systems\nwere also included in the sample to learn more about the distribution\nformulas they use and to ascertain the reasons they have not chosen\nperformance criteria as a factor in determining funding allocations.\nOf the 56 surveys distributed, 12 of the funding agency surveys\nand 13 of the fund recipient surveys were returned\nQuestionnaire Part One: Funding Programs\nEach survey was divided into two parts. Part One was designed\nto extract general information about the agency's funding programs\nIn the first section, respondents were asked if their agency has formal\ngoals or priorities for its funding programs, the specific areas in\nwhich goals were established, and how these goals or priorities were\nestablished Information was also requested to determine if funding\nrecipients participated in setting these goals and priorities and if a\nrelationship existed between the goals for their transit assistance\nprograms and the performance measures used in allocating funds\nThe second section focused on measuring the advantages or\ndisadvantages of perceived benefits and/or drawbacks associated\nwith performance-based allocation methods This was designed to\ncompare responses of funding agencies with responses of the fund\nrecipients.\nThe third section asked if performance-based allocation\nsystems are accomplishing the goals set out for their public\ntransportation programs. It also asked if the local transit systems\nreceiving funds are managing, performing, and showing results in\nways that they would not had the allocation system not been\nperformance based\nSection four inquired about the cost of administering\nperformance-based allocation systems. Respondents were asked for\nadvice to other organizations considering establishing a performance-\nbased allocation system.\nA special section of Part One pertained only to funding\nagencies that do not use performance-based allocation systems in\nfunding transit systems These respondents were asked if they had\never considered revising their existing allocation method to be\nperformance based. Respondents answering no were then asked why\nthey were not considering switching to a performance-based\nallocation system.\nThose agencies that do use performance-based allocations, or\nthat have considered doing so, were asked whether they were doing\nanything to analyze, change, or adjust their system.\nQuestionnaire Part Two: Profile\nPart Two of the survey instrument requested funding agencies\nto profile specific elements of their individual performance-\nallocation system They were asked if allocation adjustments were\nmade to fit the special needs of certain recipients who would\notherwise be financially penalized by having their allocation level\ndetermined through performance-based funding.\nFINDINGS\nGeneral Information\nMost respondents indicated that they have established goals and\npriorities for the programs they fund In contrast, only one-half of all\nlocal recipients--those agencies directly responsible for transit\noperations--had formal goals or priorities pertaining to their transit\nservices. Goals of funding agencies were established through\nlegislation and by senior management staff The departments of\ntransportation in Pennsylvania, Vermont, and Texas indicated that\ntheir goals and objectives were developed in this manner Goals and\npriorities of the operating agencies were developed through strategic\nplanning processes, as part of budget development activities, and to a\nlesser extent through legislation Approximately one-half of the\nfunding agencies indicated that grant recipients assist in the\ndevelopment of goals and priorities\nBoth funding agencies and funding recipients said that program\ngoals were most likely to be established for the following\nperformance measures (from most to least responses):\n\n-\nRidership\n-\nEfficiency (cost per some unit of measure)\n-\nLocal support\n-\nService expansion\nResponses from both funding agencies and funding recipients\nindicated that performance and program goals were not established\nfor quality of life factors, such as congestion reduction,\nenvironmental impact, land use impact, and economic development.\nThe New York State Department of Transportation, the Greater\nCleveland Regional Transit Authority, and many other funding\nagencies and recipients indicated that measures related to transit\nperformance, such as ridership, constituted the major category for\nwhich goals were established (see Table 1).\nMeans of Distribution\nAlthough funding agencies have undertaken formal actions to\ndevelop program goals and objectives, the predominant funding\nallocation method cited was based on nonperformance or non-goal\nrelated factors (see Table 2). Two methods in particular were\nfrequently cited.\nWith the first method, funding agencies develop allocation\nlevels through a formula that considers population and size of the\nservice area. The method by which Los Angeles County, California,\napportions funds to transit systems is an example of this first method.\nWithin Los Angeles County, continued eligibility to receive\noperating funds is determined through the continual assessment of\nperformance related measures Funding, however, is allocated using a\nformula calculated on total vehicle service miles and patronage\nsupport, which is quantified as farebox revenues. Farebox revenues\nare divided by each operator's respective base fare to equalize the\ndifference in fare structures among operators. This normalized figure\nis defined as \"fare units.\" The percentage share of funding distributed\nto each eligible operator is ultimately based on a formula that is 50\npercent vehicle service miles plus 50 percent fare units.\nWith the second method, funds are allocated according to\nfinancial need. A transit system applies for funds and justifies the\nlevel of funding requested. Funding limits are defined by the\npercentage of operating costs the funding agency is willing to incur.\nTABLE 1\nPROGRAM AREA GOALS ESTABLISHED FOR\nRECENT FUNDING YEAR\nGoal\nFunding Agencies\n(no. of responses)\nFunding recipients\n(no. of responses)\nRidership\nEfficiency\nService\nExpansion\nCongestion\nReduction\nLand Use\nImpact\nEconomic\nDevelopment\nLocal Support\nThis operating cost-to-revenue ratio ranged from 35 percent to 50\npercent, according to those funding agencies responding to the\nsurvey This approach accomplishes the funding agency's budget\nobjective of predicting maximum subsidies. Moreover, it requires\ntransportation operators to perform efficiently, and also requires local\njurisdictions to assume responsibility for all operating costs that\nexceed a combination of fare revenue and state and federal assistance\nThe Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) is\nstrongly in favor of a needs-based funding approach. PennDOT\nbelieves funding transportation needs is more important than\nperformance measures in allocating funds It believes performance-\nbased funding is too rigid and does not adequately address\ntransportation funding needs. To the extent performance is used in\nallocating funds, PennDOT advocates using a few simple aggregate\nfactors, such as farebox recovery, cost per hour, and revenue per\nhour.\nPerformance measurements were maintained by many transit\nsystems as a separate information bank, and they were not directly\nrelated to fund allocation. The oversight agency often uses\nperformance measures as part of the program management and\nplanning process to determine system performance trends, to\ndetermine if services or routes should be modified to improve\nperformance, and to serve as a basis for the overall justification by\nstate funding agencies and boards to continue funding transit. The\nTexas Department of Transportation recently eliminated performance\nmeasurement from its allocation formula, and it has positioned\nmonitoring of performance as a major program management\nfunction.\nActually, states that use performance measures tend to rely on\nfunding formulas containing a number of factors, only some of which\nare performance related. Respondents explained that allocations\nstrictly based on performance measures yield inherent funding\ninequities for smaller, less comprehensive, and nontraditional (e.g.,\ndemand-responsive, paratransit) transit systems. Transit operations\nserving smaller areas frequently travel longer distances, through less\ndensely populated areas, and transport fewer riders. In addition, some\nservices transit systems provide are not productive from a revenue-\ngeneration standpoint, but they do provide a valuable public service\nto specific groups of commuters. Medical related and reverse-\ncommute trips for employment are two such services. Transit\nsystems would be penalized for providing lightly used but socially\nimportant service if allocation formulas exclusively comprised\nperformance-based measures.\nBeing cognizant of this, many states, including New York and\nMichigan, and the Ministry of Transportation in Ontario, Canada, use\na funding formula that combines a number of performance and\nTABLE 2\nMEANS OF FUNDING DISTRIBUTION\nDistribution Method\nFunding Agencies\n(no. of responses)\nFunding Recipients\n(no. of responses)\nPolitical Earmarking\nDiscretionary\n(need based)\nNonperformance\nFormula\nPerformance Formula\nCombination of\nFactors\n\nnonperformance factors to reflect more balance in the allocation of\nfunds. Factors used in these allocation formulas include population,\nservice area size, density of service area, ridership, and operating-\ncost-to-revenue ratios. This mix of factors lessens inequities and\ninsensitivities to differences in needs that many respondents\nconveyed as major drawbacks of performance-based funding\nmethods.\nAdvantages and Disadvantages\nAdvantages\nThis section of the questionnaire was intended to draw out\nperceptions about performance-based systems from all funding\nagencies, regardless of the allocation method used to fund their\nprograms. Funding recipients were asked to respond to similar\nstatements so that the views of the two groups could be compared.\nAll respondents were asked to rate possible advantages and\ndisadvantages in the following manner: \"strong advantage,\"\n\"moderate advantage,\" \"small advantage,\" or \"not an advantage at\nall.\"\nThose responding to the questionnaire rated the ability of\nperformance-based funding to \"force or encourage local transit\nsystems to accomplish the goals for funding public transportation\" as\na small advantage to no advantage\n\"Performance-based allocation is not burdensome to administer\nfrom a paperwork or reporting standpoint\" was the second statement\nto which those surveyed were asked to respond. Funding agencies\nrated this factor a moderate advantage, while funding recipients\nconsidered this factor either a small advantage or no advantage at all.\nFunding agencies rated the statement \"It is inexpensive to\nadminister\" as a moderate advantage Recipients perceived the\nstatement \"inexpensive for them to apply for or receive performance-\nbased allocations\" as no advantage at all.\nThere was an equal split between perceptions of funding\nagencies reacting to the assertion of \"performance-based allocations\nbeing equitable to all recipients.\" About one-half, including New\nYork, Vermont, and Ontario, considered it a strong advantage, while\nthe other one-half, including Pennsylvania and Texas, perceived it as\nno advantage at all. There was a similar divergence in the views of\nfunding agencies regarding the statement, \"It eliminates or reduces\nthe politics of allocation decisions.\" This split in perception is most\nlikely related to the degree of political input and geographic interest\npresent in each of the states or areas served by the respondents.\nFunding agencies considered this statement only a small advantage.\nBoth funding agencies and recipients \"considered performance-based\nallocation as a way to build credibility and constituency for transit by\ndocumenting actual accomplishment and performance\" as only a\nsmall advantage. The Ministry of Transportation in Ontario and the\nVermont Department of Transportation were two agencies that felt\nstrongly that performance-based funding did build credibility.\nOnly funding agencies were asked to react to the statement,\n\"The recipients are satisfied.\" Many of those surveyed differed\ngreatly in their perceptions. Some agencies considered this statement\na strong advantage, while others perceived it a small advantage All\nthose surveyed were asked to respond to the statement,\n\"Local recipients can predict how much money they will receive\nfrom one year to the next \" Fund recipients saw this as a moderate\nadvantage, and some funding agencies perceived this as a strong\nadvantage, while the New York and Michigan departments of\ntransportation considered it to be no advantage at all.\nDisadvantages\nRespondents were also asked to register their views as to\nwhether a series of statements regarding performance-based\nallocation were considered to be a \"strong disadvantage,\" \"moderate\ndisadvantage,\" \"small disadvantage,\" or \"not a disadvantage at all.\"\nAll respondents perceived the statement, \"It is a burden to\nadminister performance-based allocation with respect to cost, staff\ntime, and other administrative support\" as a small disadvantage or no\ndisadvantage at all. Funding agencies perceived there to be a greater\ndisadvantage associated with the propensity for \"transit recipients to\nexaggerate aspects of their performance\" than did recipients. This is\nnot a surprising result and suggests one possible reason why more\nagencies do not use performance-based allocation methods This\noccurrence is referred to as \"creaming\" by Osborne and Gaebler,\nauthors of Reinventing Government. Creaming occurs when service\nproviders deliberately deliver the numbers they're asked to deliver,\neven if they need to adjust budgets or modify program results.\nThe statement \"It does not treat all recipients fairly,\" was\nconsidered to be a strong disadvantage or no disadvantage by funding\nagencies. Recipients considered this to be a small disadvantage only\nThe variance in the response by funding agencies might relate to the\ninequities associated with funding transit systems that provide\nvarying types of services (e.g., fixed route, demand response,\ndeviated-fixed route) in the same manner and use similar\nperformance factors and goals\nAll recipients were consistent in rating as a small disadvantage\nthe statement, \"Performance-based allocations are subject to frequent\nappeal.\" Both groups of respondents also had similar responses to the\nstatement \"It doesn't address program goals other than equity,\"\nconsidering it as a moderate disadvantage or no disadvantage at all.\nOnly funding agencies were asked to respond to two\nstatements. To the first statement, \"Local recipients cannot predict\nfrom year-to-year how much money they will receive,\" most of the\nagencies responded that it was a small disadvantage or no advantage\nat all. Respondents were split in their perceptions of the second\nstatement, \"Performance-based allocation is too mechanical and does\nnot reflect real-world factors.\" The Pennsylvania and Texas\ndepartments of transportation, for example, stated that this was a\nstrong disadvantage, and others, such as the New York and Michigan\ndepartments of transportation, indicated that it was only a small\ndisadvantage.\nFund recipients were asked to react to one final statement,\n\"Performance-based\nallocation\nstresses\ncertain\naspects\nof\nperformance that they do not think are important or are not a priority\nfor them\" This was rated only as a small disadvantage or as not an\nadvantage at all.\n\nRESULTS AND IMPACTS\nA specific set of questions was asked of funding agencies using\nperformance-based allocation systems and funding recipients who\nreceive subsidies based on certain performance measures.\nGoal Attainment\nFunding agencies believe that their performance-based\nallocation system is accomplishing the goals set out by their public\ntransportation program. Likewise, the majority of recipients believed\nthat the performance-based allocation system is consistent with the\ngoals established by their funding agency Among the funding\nrecipients, the Ames Transit Agency in Iowa and the Winston-Salem\nTransit Authority in North Carolina disagreed by indicating that\nperformance-based funding was not responsible for achieving goals\nestablished by their funding agency.\nPerformance Incentives\nFunding agencies were split on whether the performance\nallocation method was an incentive to perform better. Recipients\ngenerally did not believe that the agency was being managed, was\nperforming, or was showing results in ways that would not be\noccurring if the funding allocation system were not performance\nbased. Many of these agencies commented that \"good performance\nand management are inherent in the management of transit operation,\nand they are not dependent on the funding allocation arrangement.\"\nAgencies responsible for distributing financial assistance\nreported that the cost of administering performance-based allocation\nsystems was negligible and was not perceived to be a staff or\naccounting burden.\nReluctance to Shift to Performance Allocation Approach\nAbout one-half of the funding agencies indicated that their\norganizations had considered revising their existing allocation system\nto a performance-based funding system. The lack of political support,\nlow funding levels, and satisfaction with their existing allocation\nsystem were cited as reasons these agencies did not plan to switch to\na performance-based funding system. A few transit systems indicated\nthat elected officials and executive appointees want to retain their\nability to earmark funds Some felt performance allocations would\nyield less funding for transit systems and the overall state transit\nassistance program.\nRespondents were asked to provide advice to transit systems\nconsidering establishing a performance-based allocation system.\nWhile minimal advice was offered, some frequently repeated\ncomments were as follows:\n-\nPerformance measures must be consistently defined\n-\nPaperwork and documentation should be reduced to a\nminimum.\n-\nThe elapsed time for application reviews and the\nobligation of funds should likewise be reduced to a minimum.\n-\nPerformance information on all systems should be shared\nwith all systems to determine a performance ranking\nPerformance Measures as a Funding Incentive\nThere must be an effort to share information on how recipient\ntransit systems stack up against one another. This observation was\nmade particularly by funding recipients.\nPennDOT and the Michigan Department of Transportation\nindicated that performance is used as a funding incentive. A\nPennDOT case study presented later on in this report provides a\ndetailed description of the agency's transit funding program.\nThe Michigan Department of Transportation was the only\nresponding funding agency that indicated it provided two\nperformance-based funding incentive programs, the Local Share\nBonus Program and the Effective Service Bonus Program. The\nprograms are funded at $1 million each out of the Public\nTransportation Development account of the state's Comprehensive\nTransportation Fund. This is a companion program to the Federal\nTransit Administration urban Section 9 and nonurban Section 18\noperating assistance programs. Annual reconciliation reports, based\non the state fiscal year, are required, and each agency must have an\nannual audit performed by an independent audit firm or the Michigan\nDepartment of Treasury, based on the local fiscal year. Quarterly\noperating assistance reports are also required. Adjustments in\nfunding may be made based on the required reports and audits.\nPERFORMANCE ALLOCATION SYSTEM PROFILES\nThe last part of the questionnaire asked respondents to note the\nperformance variables used in their allocation systems.\nRidership per population or population density and ridership\nper expense were cited as the two most common performance\nmeasures used in state allocation formulas. Cost per revenue mile,\nsubsidy per revenue mile, and subsidy per passenger were also cited,\nbut not as frequently (see Table 3)\nSimilar to funding agencies, the majority of recipient agencies\nindicated that the performance-based allocation approach is used\nmainly for state or provincial general funds. Federal funds were also\ncited by a few of the respondents. Funding allocations were\npredominantly based on ridership per population or population\ndensity and cost per revenue mile.\nSUMMARY\nThe overall findings from respondents to questions pertaining\nto their allocation methodology indicate that, in general, states using\nperformance measures tend to rely on funding formulas that contain\nseveral diverse factors--only some of which are performance related.\nFunding agencies, as well as fund recipients, responded that\nallocation approaches strictly based on performance measures yield\ninherent funding inequities especially for smaller,\nTABLE 3\nPERFORMANCE MEASURES USED IN ALLOCATION\nSYSTEMS\nFunding Agencies\nFunding Recipients\nPerformance Measure\n(no. of responses)\n(no. of responses)\nCost per revenue mile\nCost per passenger\nRidership per\npopulation\nSubsidy per revenue\nmile\nSubsidy per passenger\nRidership per expense\nNone of the above\n\nless comprehensive, and nontraditional (e g, demand-\nresponsive paratransit) transit systems. In general, transit\nsystems serving smaller areas frequently travel longer\ndistances, through less densely populated areas, and transport\nfewer riders\nIn addition, some of the services provided by transit\nsystems are not productive from a revenue-generation\nstandpoint, but they do provide a valuable public service to\nspecific groups of commuters.\nMedical related trips and reverse commute trips for\nemployment are two such services. If performance-based\nallocation methods were imposed, many transit systems\nwould be penalized for providing lightly used but socially\nimportant services if allocation formulas were exclusively\ncomposed of performance-based measures\n\nCHAPTER FIVE\nCASE STUDIES\nCase studies for three state departments of transportation were\ndeveloped as part of the synthesis. The three departments were\nselected because of the diversity in their approach, experience, and\nphilosophies regarding performance-based funding Each brings out a\ndifferent set of issues In addition, over the past few years, all three\nstates have undergone modifications to their transit allocation\nformulas.\nThe Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT)\ncase study highlights the shift from an allocation formula that was\nperformance-based to one that predominantly allocates funds on the\nbasis of transit system need. PennDOT now uses performance\nmeasures as an incentive to provide supplemental funding to transit\nsystems.\nThe Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) uses a\nmultifactor allocation formula that is intended to foster improved\ntransit performance and encourage high levels of local financial\nsupport This case study illustrates how the weighting of allocation\nformula variables can influence transit system priorities and local\ngovernment actions\nThe Texas Department of Transportation's (TxDOT) transit\nprogram is the third case study. In this study, a major change in\nprogram philosophy and the programmatic role of performance\nmeasures are highlighted and explained. TxDOT has eliminated\nperformance measurement from its allocation formula, and it has\nemphasized\nperformance\nassessments\nas\na\nmajor\nprogram\nmanagement area.\nPENNSYLVANIA DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION\nNumber of Transit Systems Supported:\n38 urban and rural transit systems\nPrimary Allocation Mechanism:\nTransit systems--formula based on historical funding (financial need)\nand selected performance factors\nPrimary Distribution Factors:\nTransit systems FY 1990-91--A maintenance of effort provision and\na transit system prorated share (percentage) of total vehicle hours and\nof total operating revenues\nTotal Dollar Value of Operating Subsidy Program:\nFiscal year 1994-95--$245 million urban, $2.3 million rural operating\nassistance\nFor More Information:\nPennsylvania Department of Transportation, Bureau of Public\nTransportation, 1215 Transportation & Safety Building, Harrisburg,\nPA 17120\nThe Commonwealth of Pennsylvania's transit program is\nmanaged by the Bureau of Public Transportation, an organizational\nunit of PennDOT. PennDOT's primary transit role is to administer\nthis large funding program, as well as provide technical assistance to\nits recipients. Providing mobility is a fundamental goal of the\ncommonwealth's transit program Alleviating traffic congestion and\nimproving air quality are two other important program objectives.\nPennDOT Recipients\nThe commonwealth provides financial assistance to 38 transit\nsystems There are 21 urban transit systems that provide fixed-route\nservice. Of these, 4 systems also operate rural transit services In\naddition, 17 rural transit systems provide a variety of fixed-route and\ndemand-responsive services.\nThe number of urban transit systems has not substantially\nincreased since the mid 1970s, when the public takeover of private\nbus companies was occurring. However, there has been substantial\ngrowth in the number of rural transit systems, which has nearly\ndoubled over the past decade.\nTo control state outlays for new rural transit systems, the state\nlegislature, as part of a 1991 law, established dedicated funding for\ntransit and placed a limit on funding for new rural transit systems For\ngeneral fund assistance, the legislature grand-fathered all existing\nrural systems. All new rural transit systems are required to be\nsupported from a limited state set-aside for new service and selected\nother activities.\nFunding\nPennsylvania's public transit program is funded through a\ncombination of federal, state, and local funds. Of the three sources,\nstate funding is, by far, predominant. State funding is derived from\nthree areas of the state's treasury: general funds, lottery funds, and\ndedicated transit funds. Pennsylvania provides the third highest level\nof state funds for transit nationally (behind California and New\nYork), and it has retained this position for a number of years This\nyear, Pennsylvania will provide over $650 million in capital and\noperating assistance for transit statewide.\nThe largest state funding source is general funds used to sup:\nport operating assistance and state bonding for capital project\nassistance To obtain state general operating funds, transit needs\ncompete head-to-head with other general fund-supported programs,\nincluding schools and welfare assistance.\nThe next largest source of state transit funds is dedicated\nfunding, which was authorized by the state legislature in August\n1991 Up to one-half of this dedicated funding can be used for \"asset\nmaintenance,\" which essentially defrays maintenance related\noperating expenses. Remaining dedicated funds can be used for\ncapital projects. State law permits recipients to use all of their\nallocation for capital purposes, but limits the use of dedicated funds\nfor operating related expenses to a maximum of about 50 percent.\nThis relatively new dedicated funding source currently generates\nover $150 million annually.\n\nA portion of Pennsylvania's state lottery fund is also available\nfor transit The uses of these funds are specified for two programs.\nUnder the first, the Free Transit Program for Senior Citizens, transit\nsystems are reimbursed for the revenue loss they incur in providing\nfree rides to senior citizens during off-peak hours. Under the second,\nthe Shared Ride Program for Senior Citizens, individuals who cannot\nuse fixed-route transit service can receive shared-ride, curb-to-curb\nservice Passengers or their sponsors pay 15 percent of the fare, and\nthe state pays 85 percent of the applicable shared-ride fare The transit\nset-aside from these lottery programs has grown from under $10\nmillion in the early 1970s to over $130 million a year\nAlthough Pennsylvania has established a substantial state\nfunding base for transit assistance, providing adequate transit funding\nremains the major program challenge. Frequent reductions in federal\ntransit program assistance, particularly in the area of operating\nassistance, paired with rising transit operating costs, make this the\nmajor ongoing challenge. This is exacerbated by the numerous\nunfunded federal mandates that draw on available budgetary\nresources. These mandates include the Americans with Disabilities\nAct, the Clean Air Act, alcohol and drug testing requirements, and\nnumerous other federal programs.\nFormer Funding Allocation Methodology\nPrior to the current system of allocation, the state used a\nperformance-based methodology with a strong performance related\nelement in which a bonus was provided that increased the state's\nfunding share. Systems exceeding performance goals would receive a\nhigher state share of funding. However, this had an unforeseen\nnegative effect on the level of local funding, which actually led to the\nreduction of the total annual budget for some transit systems\nSpecifically, on receipt of this state increase, some local areas\nwithdrew a portion of their local funding, resulting in less local\nfinancial participation than existed before. This posed an\nunanticipated issue that was addressed when the new allocation\nsystem was being defined.\nCurrent Funding Allocation Approach\nPennsylvania's current funding allocation approach focuses on\nmeeting the basic financial needs and maintenance effort of transit\nsystems Performance factors now play a relatively modest role in\noverall state transit funding allocation methodology.\nUrban Transit Systems\nOperating Funds. The Southeastern Pennsylvania Transit\nAuthority (SEPTA) and Port Authority of Allegheny County (PAT)\nare the two largest transit systems in Pennsylvania. Operating funds\nfor these two systems constitute about 95 percent of state transit\nfunding, and their funding is allocated based on historical need. As\nspecified in state law, SEPTA is required to achieve a 50 percent\nrevenue-to-cost ratio, and PAT is required to recover 46 percent of its\ncosts from fare revenue. Meeting these cost recovery goals is a\nprerequisite to SEPTA receiving its full share of 70 percent and PAT\nreceiving its full share of 25.3 percent funding. For every percentage\npoint these systems fall short of their cost\nrecovery ratio, they lose 1 percent of state funds So far, both systems\nhave always met their respective fare recovery-to-cost ratios.\nHowever, the degree to which this ratio has been exceeded\ndiminishes each year.\nFunding for the remaining 19 urban transit systems is\ncalculated using an allocation formula applied toward the remaining\n4 7 percent of the state appropriation. One-half of a system's\nallocation is based on its historical prorated share of prior year\nfunding (financial need). One-quarter is allocated relative to the level\nof service (vehicle miles) a transit system provides compared to the\ngroup of 19 small urban systems (system share of vehicle miles). The\nremaining one-quarter is a calculation of the prorated share of\npassenger revenue. Urban transit agencies must receive at least as\nmuch state operating assistance as they received in FY 1990-91\n($234 9 million) before the performance factors effectively become\nthe allocation.\nDedicated Capital Funding. Dedicated capital and asset\nmaintenance funding is allocated on a similar basis. In this case,\nSEPTA and PAT receive 95.7 percent of available state funding--70\n3 percent for SEPTA and 25.4 percent for PAT. The other 19 small\nurban systems share the remaining 4.3 percent of the funds based on\na similar formula In this case, approximately 40 percent is based on\nhistorical need, and 60 percent is based on transit performance (a\nsystem's relative share of vehicle miles, vehicle hours, and revenue\npassengers).\nRural Transit Systems\nOperating Funds. Operating funds for the rural transit systems\nare allocated on a similar basis. Approximately 50 percent of each\nyear's annual allocation is based on a system's historical pro rata\nshare of the annual nonurban statewide transit appropriation, 25\npercent on each system's pro rata share of vehicle miles provided,\nand 25 percent on each system's pro rata share of revenue hours.\nRural transit agencies must receive at least as much state operating\nassistance as they received in FY 1990-91 ($2.3 million) before the\nperformance factors become effective.\nCapital General-Funded Program. Capital funding is allocated\non a project basis through periodic state and capital budgets. Since\nthe authorization of state dedicated funding, smaller systems have\nbecome less dependent on this state source of funding and most of\nthis resource is utilized to support the state's two large urban transit\nsystems--SEPTA and PAT.\nFunding Split\nPennsylvania has a relatively high level of state participation in\ntransit funding--both capital and operating--and a relatively low local\nfunding share requirement, compared nationally. Most urban and\nrural transit systems in Pennsylvania annually receive more state\nfunds than federal funding, and this is especially true of operating\nassistance, including lottery funds.\nThe capital funding split (bond-funded) for urban and rural\nsystems, for an 80 percent federally funded project, is 16 66 state and\n3.33 local funding. For nonfederal projects, the state share is limited\nto 50 percent of total costs unless the limit is waived by the\nlegislature.\nThe local operating fund contribution for most urban systems\nand rural systems is one-third of the state grant. Essentially, for\n\nevery $1.00 of local funds, the state contributes $3.00. For state\ndedicated funding, the local share is 1/30 of total state/local funding\n(i.e., local governments must provide $1.00 for every $29.00 of state\nassistance).\nPennsylvania staff strongly support the current allocation\nprocess as an appropriate and equitable way to fund transit systems,\nwhich heavily weights system financial need, but also provides a\nperformance-based incentive to most systems. The percentage of\nfederal operating assistance varies greatly among these systems and\ncan cover from 50 percent of a system's operating deficit to as little\nas 8 percent of their deficit (e.g., SEPTA and PAT).\nChallenges to the Allocation Method\nPennDOT staff identified three shortcomings in their current\nfund allocation system.\nInflexibility to Increase a System's Funding\nThe state allocation to each of the 17 urban systems, the 17\nrural transit systems, and 4 combined urban/rural systems, is\nrelatively constant from year to year. When a system has a legitimate\nneed to significantly increase service, the funding program is not\nvery flexible in its ability to accommodate such an increase. Annual\nincreases or decreases in service usually do not significantly affect\nthe amount of a system's allocation.\nLack of Cost Recovery Incentives\nThere is an absence of a cost recovery incentive for the\nmajority of transit systems to keep their revenue cost recovery at a\nminimum level. In the prior allocation system, which was more\nheavily weighted on performance, there was a funding incentive\nkeeping fare increases commensurate with inflation to maintain a\nminimum cost recovery level. Currently, a transit system might have\ndeclining revenues, but this doesn't adversely affect the level of state\nallocation. Only SEPTA and PAT have a direct financial incentive to\nmaintain their cost recovery as a result of state funding methods.\nPreviously, all transit agencies were subject to a minimum cost\nrecovery level.\nSimilarly, the allocation formula does not provide a strong\nincentive to transit systems to contain expenses In the case of SEPTA\nand PAT, where there is a revenue recovery requirement, their choice\nnot to increase fares requires them to reduce expenses. However, the\nother urban systems and the rural systems lack this expense\ncontainment.\nLack of Incentives to Reduce Unproductive Service and to Curb\nCosts\nBoth the urban and rural transit operating and dedicated fund\nallocation formulas include vehicle miles of service as a performance\nfactor. Therefore, there is a funding disincentive to decrease miles of\nservice, even if it is unproductive. In the PennDOT formula, there is\nan incentive to retain unproductive service. A system can increase its\nvehicle miles and see an increase in its allocation. A decrease in\nservice miles has a negative effect on its share\nof the allocation. This is an example of the need for proper balance\namong performance-based factors in any allocation formula.\nPerformance-Based Allocation Levels\nDuring the past few years, state transit appropriations have\nremained relatively constant. Therefore, the performance-based\nfactors in the allocation formulas for smaller urban and rural systems\nhave been relatively insignificant in the distribution of state funds\namong transit systems.\nHowever, in fiscal year 1994, for the first time in 4 years, the\nstate urban appropriation for transit grew by about $5 million (from\n$232.9 to $237.5 million). This amount was sufficient to increase the\nstate funding appropriation beyond the \"maintenance of effort\" level\nof $234.9 million. Consequently, that portion of the allocation\nformula, which is performance-based, has yielded significant\nincreases in allocations for selected transit systems that increased\nservice in fiscal year 1994.\nIn future years, as the appropriation level continues to increase\nto levels beyond what was provided in FY 1990-91 to cover inflation\nand losses in federal aid, systems will benefit more from the\nperformance elements in this allocation formula.\nOverall, PennDOT staff are pleased with the recent effect\nperformance-based factors have had on transit system allocations.\nBecause of the unanticipated stagnation in the growth of the state\nmass transit appropriation, it took 4 years for the state's urban\nallocation methodology to yield the performance-based impacts\noriginally anticipated. This trend is likely to continue into the future.\nPennDOT's Rationale\nPennDOT staff believe financial need should be the dominant\nfactor in funding transit systems They believe other formulas tend to\nunderrate need and overrate performance. Performance should be\nused mainly as an incentive, not as the major factor in whatever\nformula is used. This is necessary to preserve service in areas where\nproductivity may not be high. In general, performance should not be\nused as a substitute for financial need-based funding but rather as a\nsupplement.\nPennDOT staff agree that it is appropriate for funding formulas\nto reduce relative funding for transit systems that experience lower\nproductivity, but it is not good public policy to dramatically reduce\nor eliminate obsolete transit funding in these areas. Many citizens\nstill have a need for mobility in these communities, regardless of the\nperformance levels of the local transit system. Therefore, preserving\nthis needed public transit service will require at least some public\nfinancial support.\nINDIANA DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION\nNumber of Transit Systems Supported:\n32 urban and rural systems receive state and federal funds 6 systems\nreceive only federal funds\nPrimary Allocation Mechanism:\nFormula using performance measures and level of local funds\ncontributed\nPrimary Allocation Factors:\nPassenger trips, total vehicle miles, locally derived income\n\nTotal Dollar Value of Subsidy Program\nFiscal Year 1994--$17.7 million\nFor More Information:\nIndiana Department of Transportation, Indiana Government Center\nNorth, 100 N. Senate, N901, Indianapolis, IN 46204\nINDOT\nis\nresponsible\nfor\nadministering\nthe\npublic\ntransportation program for the state of Indiana. This encompasses\nmanaging the public mass transportation fund, administering the state\nfunding allocation formula to transit systems, serving as the\n\"Designated Recipient\" for federal Section 18 and Section 16 funds,\nand granting federal and state funds to transit systems statewide.\nIn the mid 1980s, Indiana modified its public transportation\nfunding methodology. Three major developments contributed to the\nchange in allocation methodology. (1) the population-based funding\nformula resulted in inequities for many transit systems, (2) the rapid\ngrowth in the number of transit recipients receiving state funds\nplaced a burden on the state, and (3) during the 1980s, the federal\ngovernment proposed eliminating federal operating assistance\nConsequently, INDOT, at the direction of the Indiana General\nAssembly, was asked to develop an allocation program that would\nprovide an equitable distribution of funds and be capable of limiting\nthe state's financial exposure in its support of transit.\nFunding\nIn 1980, the Indiana General Assembly created a dedicated\nstate funding source to help support public transit This funding\nsource is known as the Public Mass Transit Fund (PMTF). Its\nrevenue is derived from 0.76 percent of the state's general sales and\nuse tax. Technically, PMTF is permitted to provide a match-up to the\ntotal sum of the Locally Derived Income (LDI, defined as local\nfinancial support) of an approved capital or operating grant. In fiscal\nyear 1994, the level of PMTF budgeted by INDOT was $17.7\nmillion.\nNumber of Systems\nPMTF is available only to municipally operated transit systems\nthat began receiving funds from PMTF before 1986. Thirty-two\npublic transit systems receive assistance from PMTF. The six\nadditional systems that began service after 1986 receive only federal\nassistance from INDOT. Their remaining funding comes from local\nsources\nFunding Allocation Approach\nPurdue University, under contract to INDOT, developed a new\nallocation approach that guarantees a minimum base level of state\nfinancial assistance It provides additional state funding based on a\nformula that factors the amount of local funding provided for the\ntransit operation and transit system performance.\nThis allocation approach is intended to do the following:\n-\nEncourage improved operating performance and increase\nlocal financial support\n-\nProvide at least a minimal level of state financial support\n-\nImprove the effectiveness of the state's allocation process.\nINDOT staff indicated that the allocation formula achieves\nthese three objectives of providing a guaranteed base level of PMTF\nsupport. The formula also provides an accountable method of\nfinancial distribution that reflects INDOT's objective to encourage\nlocal financial support for its transit systems.\nAlthough the allocation formula contains three performance-\nbased parameters-system passengers, operating expense, operating\nsubsidy--INDOT staff report it has a minimal effect in encouraging\nand rewarding improved operating performance It also has a minimal\neffect on penalizing systems that perform poorly. The very high\nweighting the formula places on local financial contribution reduces\nthe impact performance factors can have on the allocation. In fact,\npoor performance or a downward turn in performance will have little\nor no effect on a system's allocation if the local funding level is high.\nThe allocation formula reflects quite clearly what Indiana considers\nto be important with respect to its transit investment activities\nLocal Funding Contribution\nINDOT places a strong emphasis on local financial\ncontributions toward transit system operating expenses In the\nallocation formula, LDI contributions include transit fares collected;\ntax revenue that is used to support a transit system; non-\ntransportation revenue, such as bus advertising revenue; and in some\ncases, in-kind services The level of LDI varies according to locale.\nFor instance, in Muncie, a special taxing district called the Public\nTransit Corporation (PTC) has been established. PTC allocates a\npercentage of Muncie property tax for local transit support. This tax\ngenerates about $2 million in LDI annually Terre Haute, on the other\nhand, has not established a PTC, and its LDI is significantly lower.\nConsequently, Muncie receives a higher level of annual PMTF than a\nmunicipality that does not, or cannot, provide high or increased\nlevels of LDI, such as Terre Haute.\nSystem Groupings\nTo budget for transit systems of varying sizes, INDOT has\ngrouped transit systems into four categories. These systems compete\nfor PMTF funds with other transit systems within their \"group.\" The\nsize of the service area and the type of service provided define each\nof the four categories.\nThe groups are allotted a specific percentage of PMTF funds\nThese percentages reflect operating subsidy needs of each group\n(group operating deficit versus statewide deficit). Theoretically, the\nlevel of funding allotted for each group remains constant, and the\ntransit systems compete for their share through the allocation\nformula. Consequently, transit systems with the highest LDI receive\nthe highest amount of state funding In actual practice, however, the\nbudget level for each group is increased based on the funding needs\nof all transit systems within a particular grouping\nGroup 1 Large Fixed-Route--58 Percent\nThese systems are located in areas over 200,000 in population\nand typically are also the recipients of federal Section 9 urban\noperating and capital funding. Examples of large fixed-route systems\nare Fort Wayne, Gary, and Indianapolis.\n\nGroup 2. Medium Fixed-Route--24 Percent\nMedium systems are located in areas with populations between\n53,000 and 200,000. In addition to receiving PMTF funds, they also\nreceive Section 9 small urban operating and capital funding. Muncie,\nBloomington, and Hammond are examples of medium fixed-route\nsystems.\nGroup 3. Small Fixed-Route--9 Percent\nLocated in areas with populations under 50,000, these small\nfixed-route systems provide service in rural areas. They are eligible\nto receive federal Section 18 rural funding. Richmond and New\nCastle are examples of small fixed-route transit systems.\nGroup 4: Demand-Response/Countywide Systems--9 Percent\nDemand-response systems are located in urban and rural areas\nand serve customers that need special transit accommodations. The\ntransit service in Goshen is an example of a demand-responsive\nsystem\nGroup 5: The Northern Indiana Commuter Transportation District\nA fifth grouping, with a special percentage PMTF allocation of\n12.34 percent, was established for the Northern Indiana Commuter\nTransportation District (NICTD). This percentage is equal to\nNICTD's 1989 percentage distribution The decision to fund NICTD\nseparately grew from concern that it was not reasonable to require\nmotor bus transit systems to compete with the service capacities of\nhigh-speed, high-demand commuter rail service. Any funds in excess\nof NICTD's 1989 base are distributed to the district only if it satisfies\nperformance criteria agreed on by INDOT and NICTD\nThe requirement that NICTD recover 50 percent of its\noperating expenses from farebox revenues is the key performance\nmeasure.\nAllocation Formula\nINDOT's allocation formula utilizes passenger trips, total\nvehicle miles, locally derived income, and operating subsidy as the\nbasis for allocating PMTF funds.\nTwo steps are involved in the allocation process.\nStep One\nIn step one, a portion of the PMTF allocation is distributed to\neach transit system to serve as a minimum operating base The base is\nequal to the dollar amount each transit system received in 1989 based\non service area population. For example, Richmond received\n$123,597 in 1989, based on the percentage of the statewide\npopulation that lived in Richmond. This continues to be its base\nallocation.\nStep Two\nIn step two, the remaining group subsidy is distributed using\nthe following measures:\n-\nLDI as a percentage of total operating expenses\n-\nPassenger trips as a percentage of service area population\n-\nPassenger trips per total vehicle mile (TVM)\nThese measures are then combined into three performance-\nbased allocation formulas and are multiplied by the LDI level.\nA.\nGroup Subsidy *\n(System LDI/Operating Expense * LDI)\n(Group LDI/Operating Expense * LDI)\nLDI, when compared to a system's operating expense ratio,\nreflects the self-sufficiency of the transit system, as well as the extent\nof local commitment to provide transit service.\nB\nGroup Subsidy * (System Passengers/Service Area Pop. * LDI)\n(Group Passengers/Service Area Pop. * LDI)\nPassengers per capita measures the degree to which residents in\na particular area patronize transit service.\nC.\nGroup Subsidy *\n(System Passenger/TVM * LDI)\n(Group Passengers/TVM * LDI)\nPassengers per total vehicle mile measures service utilization\nthe degree to which service is utilized when compared to the amount\nof service provided.\nThe total PMTF allocation to be received by a system is the\nsum of the amount derived in Step 1 and the amount derived by\ntotaling Step 2 parts A, B, and C.\nAn increased allocation for a system in a particular group could\nresult in decreased funding for the other systems in the same group\nHowever, PMTF funds are usually increased to accommodate\nfunding allocation increases without penalizing other systems.\nChallenges to the Allocation Method\nThis formula is intended to compare one system with other\nsimilar systems to gauge relative differences in performance. In\naddition, this method is designed to encourage marginal systems to\nimprove and to provide an incentive for superior systems to maintain\ntheir high performance. In actual practice, however, the high\nweighting of the LDI variable minimizes the effect system\nperformance has on determining PMTF allocations. Consequently,\nmunicipalities and transit systems are cognizant of the effect LDI\nlevels have on state allocations. Local governments, therefore, focus\non increasing their LDI, sometimes in creative ways, and view transit\nsystem performance improvements as a secondary concern. This is a\nclassic example of \"creaming,\" which was defined in Chapter 4.\nTEXAS DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION\nNumber of Transit Systems Supported:\n34 small urban area transit systems\n41 rural transit systems\n\nPrimary Allocation Mechanism:\nSystem need and state affordability\nPrimary Allocation Factors:\nSystem need contingent on system achieving or making effort to\nachieve selected performance goals\nTotal Dollar Value of Subsidy Program:\nFiscal year 1994-1995 biennium budget--$72 million\nFor More Information:\nTexas Department of Transportation, 125 East 11th Street, Austin,\nTX 78701-2483\nPublic transportation is expanding in Texas with growth limited\nlargely by the amount of available funding. Since 1989, TxDOT had\nused a performance-based method of fund allocation, but recently\nadopted a new allocation method that is not linked to transit system\nperformance. This case study describes TxDOT's transit program and\nexplains the context within which this change in allocation\nmethodology was made.\nGeneral Overview\nThe Public Transportation Division is the unit charged with\noverseeing the management of transit programs within TxDOT. This\ndivision establishes procedures and policies that are then carried out\nby district office staff. Each of the 24 TxDOT district offices has a\npublic transportation coordinator who works with the local transit\noperators on day-to-day management issues.\nTxDOT's Financial Involvement with Transit Systems\nTxDOT's level of involvement with different types of transit\nsystems varies, particularly regarding funding.\nTxDOT no longer has a direct financial relationship with the\nregional mass transit authorities. In 1991, the Texas Legislature\nrendered transit authorities, such as Houston Metro, ineligible to\nreceive state funding on the premise that funds generated for transit\nfrom their local sales tax was more than adequate and that state aid\nwas not necessary.\nTxDOT established stronger ties with the Small Urban Section\n9 transit systems (50,000 to 200,000 population) during the past year\nto address funding and help resolve constraints in that program. As\nthe administrator of the federal Section 16 (aid to nonprofit\norganizations for transportation of people who are either elderly\nand/or disabled) and Section 18 programs (operating and capital\nassistance to rural public transit systems), TxDOT has traditionally\nhad a strong working relationship with those systems and has\nprovided these programs with a great deal of technical assistance and\noversight. Given the relative maturity of rural public transit, TxDOT\nis now stepping back from a directive role and is working toward a\ncollaborative partnership with Section 18 operators. This is the major\ndevelopment leading to the decision to change the allocation\nmethodology.\nTxDOT considers its relationship with transit systems to be a\ncollaborative partnership in which the systems act as TxDOT's agents\nin serving the citizens of Texas. The close working relationship\nbetween the district coordinators and system managers provides an\n\"early warning\" system of potential problems. During\nTABLE 4\nTxDOT'S FY 1994-95 TRANSIT BUDGET\nFunding Source\nAmount\nState Transportation Funds\n$23,317,091\nGeneral Fund\n$6,000,000\nOil Overcharge\n$9,000,000\nFederal (Sections 8, 16, 18, 26)\n$33,674,597\nTotal Transit Funding\n$71,991,688\nthe past year, TxDOT has, in fact, relinquished a number of controls\nthat were perceived as micromanagement and contrary to the idea of\nlocal self-determination.\nLocal Transit Support\nOn the local level, support for transit varies widely and is\nlargely driven by local agendas. For example, environmental\nawareness is quite high in the Austin region, which has a vocal\ntransit constituency. Similar support exists in four of the five air\nquality nonattainment areas. In the rest of the state, public\ntransportation is considered to be important, but other local initiatives\nsometimes have greater budgetary priority.\nNumber of Systems\nThere are 7 metropolitan transit authorities operating in the\nurbanized areas and 24 small urban area transit systems.\nThe most dramatic growth in the past 20 years has been in the\nrural sector with the first Section 18 (rural) system funded in 1980.\nRapid expansion occurred in rural areas from 1985 through 1989\nuntil most of Texas was served by a rural operator. There are now 41\nnonurbanized public systems currently operating. Those systems are\nlargely focusing on increasing the level of service within their\nexisting territory.\nFunding\nTxDOT's biennium fiscal year 1994-95 budget is approximately\n$3 billion. Of this, the transit portion is approximately $72 million.\nThis funding is derived from four state and federal sources (see Table\n4).\nCombining local transit funds, funding provided by transit\nauthorities, small urban transit system funding, and TxDOT's transit\nbudget yields a biennium budget that exceeds $3 billion. Figure 2\ndepicts the percentage of federal, state, and local funds that support\neach of the three transit program categories.\nFunding Allocation Approaches\nNew Allocation Approach\nThe allocation approaches for Section 18 rural systems recently\nunderwent a major change. Allocations are no longer based on\ndemographic and performance data. The new allocation method is\n\nFIGURE 2 Texas Transit Funding Sources\nbased on financial need and basically provides rural systems with\ntheir current percentage of available TxDOT funds. The evaluation of\ntransit system performance is now treated separately from the\nallocation of funding. System performance has become a major\nprogram management function monitored in part by the district\noffices.\nAccording to TxDOT staff, the formerly used allocation\nprocess did not put the proper emphasis on improved performance\nfor individual systems and did not promote a partnership between\nTxDOT and Section 18 operators.\nFormer Allocation Approach\nThe original allocation formula for rural transit systems\ncontained measurements for five factors:\n1.\nNonurbanized population of the service area (pop.)\n2.\nSquare miles of service area (sq mi.)\n3.\nCost per mile of the transit system (cost per mi.)\n4.\nOne-way passenger trips per nonurbanized population of\nthe service area (trips)\n5.\nRevenues vs. expenses of the system (rev./exp.)\nThe five measures for each transit system were divided by the\ntotal of that measure for all rural systems combined. These were then\ntotaled to obtain an aggregate factor and divided by 5 to obtain an\naverage coefficient.\n{(Pop /Total Pop ) + (Sq Mi /Total Sq Mi ) + (Cost per Mi\n/Tot. Cost per Mi.) + (Trips/Tot Trips) + {(Rev /Exp\n)/(Tot Rev /Exp )]} / 5 X Avail Funding =\nUNADJUSTED ALLOCATION\nOnce allocations were calculated, funding was sometimes\nadjusted if a transit system's new annual allocation resulted in a\npercentage increase or decrease greater than the base or maximum\nfunding percentages established annually by the Transportation\nCommission. This \"cap\" maintained a measure of funding continuity\nfor transit systems and controlled state funding increases.\nPerformance Impact\nTxDOT staff indicate that the effectiveness of this allocation\nmethod in improving transit service and transit performance cannot\nbe measured accurately. The revenue recovery factor (revenue/cost)\nmay have encouraged systems to raise their fares, but with respect to\nthe other factors, it is doubtful that there was any direct impact.\nTransit systems have made some operational modifications to\nimprove overall (efficiency/effectiveness related) performance. For\ninstance, a number of systems have altered their route structure to\neliminate nonproductive runs or to capture new ridership. Several of\nthe transit authorities are investing heavily in advanced technology to\nincrease their operating efficiency and improve on-time performance.\nRural operators have initiated fixed-route service when conditions\nwarrant, replacing more expensive demand-response operations.\nChallenges of the Former Allocation Method\nApplying the annual cap/base diluted the effects of the formula\nfactors, and policymakers were understandably reluctant to reduce\nfunding to any system when overall program funding levels remained\nstable.\nAlthough the cap/base diluted the impact, the \"pure\" formula\nwould have penalized systems that provided more expensive or\ndifficult trips, such as service to persons with special needs living in\nremote areas, away from other system users. The formula clearly\nfavored fixed-route operations within small towns because of their\nhigher revenue recovery, lower cost per mile, and higher trips per\ncapita. This formula also did not address expanded levels of service\nwithin an established operating jurisdiction--for example, a system\ncould not be given more money to provide more service to the same\nbase population.\nAs part of this formula, each system was compared to all others\non the five baseline factors. It became increasingly evident,\naccording to TxDOT, that the systems were too diverse to be\nconsidered comparable. Similarly, the Section 18 systems did not\nlend themselves to peer group comparisons because of differences in\ngeographic conditions, population density, service structures, and so\nforth.\nThe methodology shifted the focus away from individual\nsystem performance. Neither the transit operators nor TxDOT paid\nmuch attention to improvement; instead, they concentrated on\nmaintaining overall funding levels. Although this is important,\naccording to TxDOT staff, \"the formula did have the potential to be\nused to improve performance, as well.\"\nNew Approach\nThe new method of allocating funds to rural transit systems\ndoes not include a direct link to performance. Instead, contractors\nreceive their current percentage of available funds, and each system\nnegotiates individual annual performance goals and management\nobjectives with TxDOT. Operators continue to receive funding as\nlong as they achieve those goals and objectives or make a good faith\neffort to do so. Lack of good faith effort subjects a system to a 1-year\nprobationary period after which they would be\n\neither terminated as a funding recipient (highly unlikely) or\nrestored to nonprobationary status.\nEssentially, in this new approach, TxDOT's district\npublic transportation coordinators negotiate with local transit\noperators to establish specific targets within the following\ncategories: cost efficiency, cost effectiveness, service\nutilization, other measures (such as safety), training,\nmarketing and public involvement, disadvantaged business\nenterprise participation, and general\nmanagement activities (such as staffing plans). The Texas\nTransportation Commission ultimately approves the systems'\nperformance goals and management objectives TxDOT\nestimates that the negotiation process requires 75 to 85\nperson days per year. TxDOT staff indicates that some length\nof time, measured by a few funding cycles, needs to pass\nbefore the effectiveness of this new allocation methodology\ncan be truly assessed.\n\nCHAPTER SIX\nCONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR\nFURTHER RESEARCH\nCONCLUSIONS\nAnalysis of the information developed for this synthesis\nsuggests a number of conclusions about the state of the art as it\napplies to performance-based funding between states and local transit\nsystems.\nThere continues to be a great diversity of opinion and\napproaches to the use of performance-based funding systems for\npublic transportation by states and regional funding entities. The\nsurvey results and the case studies confirm that the use of\nperformance-based allocation systems is still an unresolved and, at\ntimes, controversial issue among states and regional bodies\nresponsible for funding transit systems. A frequently mentioned\nconcern in the debate is that performance-based allocations often\noverlook the issue of providing transit systems with the level of\nfunding that transit organizations truly need. This raises the question\nof whether performance-related allocation should begin at some\nminimum floor of funding that meets basic operating requirements.\nIncreasingly, however, there seems to be agreement that transit\nperformance measures should be used to determine progress toward\nmeeting transit service goals and objectives to assist states in\nevaluating transit system performance and to provide a management\nsystem to monitor and improve transit services by offering technical\nassistance.\nThere is a lack of clear-cut goals established for transit in\nmany states. Where goals do exist, they tend to be universal in\nnature, such as providing mobility, encouraging and supporting\neconomic development, and improving the environment. Given their\nglobal nature, it is difficult to assign standards and measures to assess\nprogress in any meaningful way.\nSome funding organizations find themselves struggling with\nconflicts between their concerns for quality and quantity of transit\nservice provided and the need to respond to legislative and taxpayer\ndemands to constrain funding. On one hand, states are working to\nensure transit service is effective and available to their citizens On\nthe other hand, states are challenged to provide accountability. This\nfeeds fears by some transit agency recipients that ultimately\nperformance-based funding may be, at worst, a good government\nmask on initiatives to dramatically reduce or eliminate transit\noperating subsidies. The public official charged with the\nresponsibility to make judgments about the expenditure of limited\ntaxpayer dollars may counter that if transit performance is below a\ncertain level, the subsidy should shrink or go away entirely\nThere is widespread agreement among state departments of\ntransportation and regional funding bodies like metropolitan\nplanning agencies that local transit system performance should be\ntracked. Fewer agree that the results should guide financial subsidy\ndecisions, and even fewer are doing it. While performance\nmeasurement is generally viewed as an important\nmanagement technique in making local agencies accountable for\nfinancial assistance they receive, there are a number of challenges\ninherent in making performance-based allocation work Survey\nrespondents indicated (sometimes only in candid, informal\ndiscussion) that the challenges are significant enough to block the\nestablishment of entirely performance-based systems Some of the\nmore profound issues raised include the following:\n-\nIt is difficult to reach consensus on what constitutes good\nperformance, especially in light of the broad-based goals for\ntransit funding assistance.\n-\nShould performance-based financial assistance go to the\ngood performers or to the poor performers, who may have\ngreater financial needs?\n-\nFunding agency decisionmakers remain skeptical of the\nreliability of data provided by many local authorities; there is\nconcern that information can be skewed deliberately or\ninadvertently to meet benchmarks\n-\nThere is doubt as to whether performance measurement\nsystems can truly be sensitive to the differences among transit\nsystems; at the same time, external factors beyond the control\nof transit managers can also unbalance the playing field\n-\nThe influence of politics remains formidable, sometimes\ndriving funding as well as operations, regardless of\nperformance results.\n-\nFunding agency staff are reluctant to apply the financial\npenalties to local transit systems that might be dictated by\nperformance-based decisions.\n-\nPerformance-based\nfunding\nmay\nnot\nrespond\nappropriately to the competing pressures upon public transit\nsystems to take a hard-nosed business approach to service while\nalso fulfilling its social mission.\nWhen performance components are used in subsidy allocation\nformulas, they tend to be combined with other nonperformance\nfactors, or factors not traditionally viewed as performance\ncharacteristics, such as local financial contribution levels. As an\nexample, Indiana combines performance and local contribution\nlevels, with greater weight accorded to local financial support of the\ntransit system, reflecting state policy.\nTwo movements seem to be occurring among state\ndepartments of transportation that include performance measures\nin their allocation formulas.\nPerformance measurement is being used to provide an\nincentive level of funding rather than as a determinant of base\nallocations. In these instances, state departments of transportation\nprovide financial assistance necessary to support the previously\nagreed on level of service in a particular area They use a transit\nsystem's ability to achieve specified performance goals as a method\nto provide a supplemental incentive level of funding. PennDOT\nrecently adopted this change in approach, which closely reflects state\nand regional debates about providing financial\n\nsupport based on performance as opposed to it being based\non what is perceived to be the real need.\nOther states are eliminating performance-based\nmeasures from their allocation systems entirely. Officials in\nthese states view performance-based allocations as a method\nto distribute dollars in a more mechanical manner rather than\nas a method to motivate transit operations to become more\nefficient and effective in meeting the service requirements of\nthe public This emerges from their concern that transit\nsystems have directed their energies toward ensuring that\nperformance indicators remain high to secure the needed\nfunding allocation level rather than on their mission of\nproviding transportation. State departments of transportation\nhave become more focused on validating performance\nreporting and in ensuring accuracy in allocating funds. Texas\noffers an illustration of a state where performance measures\nhave been eliminated from the allocation methodology and\nfunding is now distributed according to historic levels or\nperceived need. The focus on performance measurement\ncomes as an important piece of a joint department of\ntransportation/transit system initiative to define system-\nspecific performance measures and use them to identify\nwhere improvements are required. The result is a\nmanagement as opposed to an allocation tool.\nSome\nstate\ndepartments\nof\ntransportation\nand\nmetropolitan planning organizations have considered\nperformance\nmeasurement\nand\nperformance-based\nallocation of financial aid. But\nthey recognize that developing appropriate measures and\nallocation mechanisms that are responsive is no small task.\nAt a minimum, it requires the active participation of transit\nsystems and local and state legislative bodies.\nRECOMMENDATIONS FOR FURTHER RESEARCH\nFurther research in several areas would benefit both\nfunding agencies and funding recipients who are faced with\nquestions about performance-based distribution.\nFundamental to an increase in the use of performance\nmeasures in the allocation of funds is the need for a more\nthorough\nunderstanding\nof\nthe\napplicability\nand\nappropriateness of performance measures to different types of\ntransit systems. Likewise, there is a need to enhance our\nunderstanding of how to apply and interpret the application of\nperformance measures in locales that provide similar types of\ntransit operations but within different geographic areas that\nperhaps have contrasting densities and travel needs.\nBecause many funding formulas were devised to\nmanage the allocation of state funds for operating expenses, it\nwould be useful for state departments of transportation and\ntransit systems to have research available that describes\nsuccessful, and not so successful, efforts by transit agencies\nto control and/or reduce operating expenses, yet maintain the\nappropriate level of transit service.\n\nREFERENCES\n1.\nPeat, Marwick, Mitchell & Co., Transit System\nPerformance Indicators: An Assessment of Current U.S.\nPractice, Office of Program Evaluation, Urban Mass\nTransportation Administration, p. 114.\n2.\nFielding, G.J., Managing Public Transit Strategically: A\nComprehensive Approach to Strengthening Service and\nMonitoring Performance, Jossey-Bass Publishers, 1987, p.\n60.\n3.\nCarter, D.N., and T.J.

The only exception is Smyrna Transit System (SMTS), for which the population of the city of New Smyrna Beach is used\nto approximate the service area population for these years. This measure provides a suitable approximation of overall market size for comparison of relative spending and service\nlevels among communities in the absence of actual service area population. However, in 1992, FTA began requiring transit systems to provide service area population in their\nSection 15 reports. As a result, this is the measure that is now utilized in this study.\nNational Inflation Rate - Used to deflate the operating expense data to constant 1984 dollars. Inflation-adjusted dollars provide a more accurate representation of spending\nchanges resulting from agency decisions by factoring out the general price inflation. The inflation rate reported is the percentage change in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for all\nitems (including commodities and services) from year to year. During the 1984 to 1991 period, service and labor costs tended to increase at a faster rate than did commodity prices.\nTherefore, transit operating expenses, which are predominantly comprised of service and labor costs, may be expected to have increased somewhat faster than inflation even if the\namount of service provided were not increased.\nPassenger Trips - Annual number of passenger boardings on the transit vehicles. A trip is counted each time a passenger boards a transit vehicle. Thus, if a passenger has to\ntransfer between buses to reach a destination, he/she is counted as making two passenger trips.\nPassenger Miles - Number of annual passenger trips multiplied by the system's average trip length (in miles). This number provides a measure of the total number of passenger\nmiles of transportation service consumed.\nVehicle Miles - Total distance traveled annually by revenue service vehicles, including both revenue miles and deadhead miles.\nRevenue Miles - Number of annual miles of vehicle operation while in active service (available to pick up revenue passengers). This number is smaller than vehicle miles because\nof the exclusion of deadhead miles such as vehicle miles from the garage to the start of service, vehicle miles from the end of service to the garage, driver training, and other\nmiscellaneous miles that are not considered to be in direct revenue service.\nVehicle Hours - Total hours of operation by revenue service vehicles including hours consumed in passenger service and deadhead travel.\nRevenue Hours - Total hours of operation by revenue service vehicles in active revenue service.\nRoute Miles - Number of directional route miles as reported in Section 15 data; defined as tile mileage that service operates in each direction over routes traveled by public\ntransportation vehicles in revenue service.\nTotal Operating Expense - Reported total spending on operations, including administration, maintenance, and operation of service vehicles.\n\nState of Florida\nSource: 1992 Performance Evaluation of Florida Transit Systems\nTotal Operating Expenses (1984 S) - Total operating expenses deflated to 1984 dollars for purposes of determining the real change in spending for operating expenses.\nTotal Maintenance Expense - Sum of all expenses categorized as maintenance expenses; a subset of total operating expense.\nTotal Maintenance Expense (1984 $) - Total maintenance expenses deflated to 1984 dollars for purposes of determining the real change in spending for maintenance purposes.\nTotal Capital Expense - Dollar amount of spending for capital projects and equipment.\nTotal Local Revenue - All revenues originating at the local level (excluding state and federal assistance).\nOperating Revenue - Includes passenger fares, special transit fares, school bus service revenues, freight tariffs, charter service revenues, auxiliary transportation revenues, subsidy\nfrom other sectors of operations, and non-transportation revenues.\nPassenger Fare Revenues - Revenue generated annually from passenger fares.\nTotal Employees - Total number of payroll employees of the transit agency. It is useful to note that the increasing tendency to contract out for services may result in some\nsignificant differences in this measure between othenwise similar properties. It is important to understand which services are contracted before drawing conclusions based on\nemployee levels. All employees classified as capital were excluded From this report.\nTransportation Operating Employees - All employees classified as operating employees: vehicle drivers, supervisory personnel, direct personnel.\nMaintenance Employees - All employees classified as maintenance employees who are directly or indirectly responsible for vehicle maintenance.\nAdministrative Employees - All personnel positions classified as administrative in nature. This report includes all general administration employees (marketing, planning, and\nsupport) as classified by FTA in Form 404.\nVehicles Available for Maximum Service - Number of vehicles owned by the transit authority that are available for use in bus service.\nVehicles Operated in Maximum Service - The largest number of vehicles required for providing service during peak hours (typically the rush period).\nSpare Ratio - Vehicles operated in maximum service subtracted from vehicles available for maximum service divided by vehicles operated in maximum service. This measure is\nan indicator of the number of spare vehicles available for service. A spare ratio of approximately 20 percent is considered appropriate in the industry However, this varies\ndepending on the size and age of fleet as well as the condition of equipment.\nTotal Gallons Consumed - Total gallons consumed by the vehicle fleet.\n\nState of Florida\nSource: 1992 Performance Evaluation of Florida Transit Systems\nTotal Kilowatt Hours of Power - Kilowatt hours of propulsion power consumed by a transit system (rapid rail and automated guideway).\nAverage Age of Fleet - Traditionally, a standard transit coach is considered to have a useful life of 12 years. However, longer service lives are not uncommon. The vehicle age and\nthe reliability record of the equipment, the number of miles and hours on the equipment, the sophistication and features (i.e., wheelchair lifts, electronic destination signs, etc.), and\noperating environment (weather, roadway grades, and passenger abuse) all affect the maintenance needs and depreciation of the bus fleet.\nNumber of Incidents - Total number of unforeseen occurrences resulting in casualty (injury/fatality), collision, or property damage in excess of $1,000. For an incident to be\nreportable, it must involve a transit vehicle or occur on transit property.\nTotal Roadcalls - A revenue service interruption during a given reporting period caused by failure of some mechanical element or other element.\nEFFECTIVENESS MEASURES\nVehicle Miles Per Capita - Total number of annual vehicle miles divided by the service area's population. This can be characterized as the number of miles of service provided for\neach man, woman, and child in the service area and is a measure of the extensiveness of service provided in the service area.\nPassenger Trips Per Capita - Average number of transit boardings per person per year. This number is larger in areas where public transportation is emphasized and in areas\nwhere there are more transit dependents, and is a measure of the extent to which the public utilizes transit in a given service area.\nPassenger Trips Per Revenue Mile - The ratio of passenger trips to revenue miles of service; a key indicator of service effectiveness that is influenced by the levels of demand\nand the supply of service provided.\nPassenger Trills Per Revenue Hour - The ratio of passenger trips to revenue hours of operation; reports on the effectiveness of the service since hours are a better representation\nof the resources consumed in providing service.\nAverage Speed - Average speed of vehicles in operation (including to and from the garage) calculated by dividing total vehicle miles by total vehicle hours.\nRevenue Miles Between Incidents - Number of revenue miles divided by the number of incidents; reports the average interval, in miles, between incidents.\nRevenue Miles Between Roadcalls - Number of revenue miles divided by roadcalls; an indicator of the average frequency of delays because of a problem with the equipment.\nRevenue Miles Per Route Mile - Number of revenue miles divided by the number of directional route miles of service.\n\nState of Florida\nSource: 1992 Performance Evaluation of Florida Transit Systems\nEFFICIENCY MEASURES\nOperating Expense Per Capita - Annual operating budget divided by the county/service area population; a measure of the resource commitment to transit by the community\nOperating Expense Per Peak Vehicle - Total operating expense per vehicle operated in maximum service (peak vehicle); provides a measure of the resources required per vehicle\nto have a coach in operation for a year.\nOperating Expense Per Passenger Trip - Operating expenditures divided by the total annual ridership; a measure of the efficiency of transporting riders; one of the key\nindicators of comparative performance of transit properties since it reflects both the efficiency with which service is delivered and the market demands for the service.\nOperating Expense Per Passenger Mile - Reflection of operating expense divided by the number of passenger miles; takes into account the impact of trip lenglh on performance\nsince some operators provide lengthy trips while others provide short trips.\nOperating Expense Per Revenue Mile - Operating expense divided by the annual revenue miles of service; a measure of the efficiency with which service is delivered and is\nanother key comparative indicator.\nOperating Expense Per Revenue Hour - Operating expense divided by revenue hours of operation; a key comparative measure which differs from operating expense per vehicle\nmile in that the vehicle speed is factored out. This is often important since vehicle speed is strongly influenced by local traffic conditions.\nMaintenance Expense Per Revenue Mile - Maintenance cost divided by the revenue miles.\nMaintenance Expense Per Operating Expense - Calculated by dividing maintenance expense by operating expense; expressed as a percent of total operating expense.\nFarebox Recovery - Ratio of passenger fare revenues to total operating expenses; an indicator of the share of revenues provided by the passengers.\nLocal Revenue Per Operating Expense - Ratio of total local commitment with respect to total operating expense.\nOperating Revenue Per Operating Expense - Operating ratio calculated by dividing operating revenue by total operating expense.\nVehicle Miles Per Peak Vehicle - Vehicle miles divided by the number of peak vehicles. It is an indicator of how intensively the equipment is used and is influenced by the bus\ntravel speeds as well as by the levels of service in the off-peak time periods. A more uniform demand for service over the day would result in a higher number.\nVehicle Hours Per Peak Vehicle - Substitutes vehicle hours for vehicle miles and again reflects how intensively equipment is utilized.\n\nState of Florida\nSource: 1992 Performance Evaluation of Florida Transit Systems\nRevenue Miles Per Vehicle Mile - Reflects how much of the total vehicle operation is in passenger service. Higher ratios are favorable, but garage location, training needs, and\nother considerations may influence the ratio.\nRevenue Miles Per Total Vehicles - Total revenue miles of service that are provided by each vehicle available for maximum service.\nRevenue Hours Per Total Vehicles - Indicates total revenue hours of service provided by each vehicle available for maximum service.\nRevenue Hours Per Employee - Reflects overall labor productivity.\nRevenue Hours Per Operating Employee - Reflects operating personnel productivity.\nRevenue Hours Per Maintenance Employee - Reflects maintenance employee productivity\nRevenue Hours Per Administrative Employee - Reflects administrative employee productivity\nVehicle Miles Per Maintenance Employee - Another measure of maintenance employee productivity\nPassenger Trips Per Employee - Another measure of overall labor productivity.\nTotal Vehicles Per Maintenance Employee - Vehicles available for maximum service divided by the number of maintenance employees.\nTotal Vehicles Per Administrative Employee - Vehicles available for maximum service divided by the number of administrative employees.\nVehicle Miles Per Gallon - Vehicle miles of service divided by total gallons consumed and is a measure of energy utilization.\nVehicle Miles Per Kilowatt-Hr - Vehicle miles of service divided by total kilowatt-hours consumed and is another measure of energy utilization.\nAverage Fare - Passenger fare revenues divided by the total number of passenger trips.\n\nSanta Clara County, California\nTransit Objectives and Performance Measures\nEXHIBIT IV-1\nADOPTED SCCTD OBJECTIVES AND SUBOBJECTIVES\n1.\nReliability - Improve Bus System Reliability to an Acceptable Level\nA.\nImprove fleet reliability\nB.\nUpgrade system operations for quick response to road calls\nC.\nImprove schedule adherence\nD.\nImprove transfer connections\n2.\nLevel of Service - Improve the Level of Transit Service in the County by Maintaining the Scheduled Expansion of the Bus Fleet\nto 516 Buses\nA.\nProvide expanded transit service throughout the County\nB.\nExtend hours of service\nC.\nProvide necessary facilities for expansion\nD.\nIncrease bus system capacity\nE.\nEvaluate the need for further service expansion\n3.\nEffectiveness - Improve Bus System Effectiveness\nA.\nEvaluate system and route performance, and make modifications as needed to improve productivity and ensure minimum\nstandards\nB.\nImprove ridership and productivity of South County Dial-a-Ride\nC.\nEnhance customer facilities at bus stops\nD.\nImprove transfer convenience and comfort\nE.\nDevelop park-and-ride facilities F Enhance transit service to downtown San Jose\nG.\nProvide timely and adequate customer information\nH.\nEncourage ridership increases through marketing and promotional programs\nI.\nDevelop customer relations programs\nJ.\nEncourage ridership through special fare provisions\n4.\nEfficiency - Improve Bus System Efficiency\nA.\nAnalyze cost effectiveness and personnel productivity utilizing management information systems\nB.\nEnsure efficient scheduling and driver utilization\nC.\nConduct daily coach operations in an efficient manner\nD.\nReduce delays and increase system speed\nE.\nMaximize fare box revenue consistent with adopted goals\n5.\nSafety - Ensure the Highest Standards of Safety in the Transit System Operation\nA.\nEnsure buses available for service meet safety standards\nB.\nReduce transit vehicle accidents\nC.\nReduce passenger falls\nD.\nEliminate unsafe routing\n6.\nFull Accessibility - Improve Bus System Accessibility to all Segments of the County Population\nA.\nDevelop programs directed toward the utilization of transit by the elderly and handicapped\nB.\nEnsure all future buses are fully accessible\nC.\nImprove accessibility to bus stops\n7.\nSouthern Pacific Commuter Service - Upgrade the S.P.

The TRB incorporates all former HRB activities and also performs additional functions under a broader\nscope involving all modes of transportation and the interactions of transportation with society. The Board's purpose is to\nstimulate research concerning the nature and performance of transportation systems, to disseminate information that the research\nproduces, and to encourage the application of appropriate research findings. The Board's program is carried out by more than 270\ncommittees, task forces, and panels composed of more than 3,300 administrators, engineers, social scientists, attorneys,\neducators, and others concerned with transportation; they serve without compensation. The program is supported by state\ntransportation and highway departments, the modal administrations of the U.S. Department of Transportation, the Association of\nAmerican Railroads, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, and other organizations and individuals interested in\nthe development of transportation.\nThe National Academy of Sciences is a private, nonprofit, self-perpetuating society of distinguished scholars engaged in\nscientific and engineering research, dedicated to the furtherance of science and technology and to their use for the general\nwelfare. Upon the authority of the charter granted to it by the Congress in 1863, the Academy has a mandate that requires it to\nadvise the federal government on scientific and technical matters. Dr Bruce Alberts is president of the National Academy of\nSciences.\nThe National Academy of Engineering was established in 1964, under the charter of the National Academy of Sciences, as a\nparallel organization of outstanding engineers It is autonomous in its administration and in the selection of its members, sharing\nwith the National Academy of Sciences the responsibility for advising the federal government. The National Academy of\nEngineering also sponsors engineering programs aimed at meeting national needs, encourages education and research, and\nrecognizes the superior achievements of engineers. Dr. Robert M.White is president of the National Academy of Engineering.\nThe Institute of Medicine was established in 1970 by the National Academy of Sciences to secure the services of eminent\nmembers of appropriate professions in the examination of policy matters pertaining to the health of the public. The Institute acts\nunder the responsibility given to the National Academy of Sciences by its congressional charter to be an adviser to the federal\ngovernment and, upon its own initiative, to identify issues of medical care, research, and education. Dr. Kenneth\nI. Shine is president of the Institute of Medicine.\nThe National Research Council was organized by the National Academy of Sciences in 1916 to associate the broad\ncommunity of science and technology with the Academy's purposes of furthering knowledge and advising the federal\ngovernment. Functioning in accordance with general policies determined by the Academy, the Council has become the principal\noperating agency of both the National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Engineering in providing services to\nthe government, the public, and the scientific and engineering communities The Council is administered jointly by both\nAcademies and the Institute of Medicine. Dr. Bruce Alberts and Dr. Robert M. White are chairman and vice chairman,\nrespectively, of the National Research Council."

Research is necessary to solve\noperating problems, to adapt appropriate new technologies from\nother industries, and to introduce innovations into the transit\nindustry. The Transit Cooperative Research Program (TCRP) serves\nas one of the principal means by which the transit industry can\ndevelop innovative near-term solutions to meet demands placed on it.\nThe need for TCRP was originally identified in TRB Special\nReport 213--Research for Public Transit: New Directions, published\nin 1987 and based on a study sponsored by the Urban Mass\nTransportation\nAdministration--now\nthe\nFederal\nTransit\nAdministration (FTA). A report by the American Public Transit\nAssociation (APTA), Transportation 2000, also recognized the need\nfor local, problem-solving research. TCRP, modeled after the\nlongstanding and successful National Cooperative Highway\nResearch Program, undertakes research and other technical activities\nin response to the needs of transit service providers. The scope of\nTCRP includes a variety of transit research fields including planning,\nservice configuration, equipment, facilities, operations, human\nresources, maintenance, policy, and administrative practices.\nTCRP was established under FTA sponsorship in July 1992.\nProposed by the U.S. Department of Transportation, TCRP was\nauthorized as part of the Intermodal Surface Transportation\nEfficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA). On May 13, 1992, a memorandum\nagreement outlining TCRP operating procedures was executed by the\nthree cooperating organizations: FTA, the National Academy of\nSciences, acting through the Transportation Research Board (TRB),\nand the Transit Development Corporation, Inc. (TDC), a nonprofit\neducational and research organization established by APTA. TDC is\nresponsible for forming the independent governing board, designated\nas the TCRP Oversight and Project Selection (TOPS) Committee.\nResearch problem statements for TCRP are solicited periodically\nbut may be submitted to TRB by anyone at any time. It is the\nresponsibility of the TOPS Committee to formulate the research\nprogram by identifying the highest priority projects. As part of the\nevaluation, the TOPS Committee defines funding levels and\nexpected products.\nOnce selected, each project is assigned to an expert panel,\nappointed by the Transportation Research Board. The panels prepare\nproject statements (requests for proposals), select contractors, and\nprovide technical guidance and counsel throughout the life of the\nproject. The process for developing research problem statements and\nselecting research agencies has been used by TRB in managing\ncooperative research programs since 1962. As in other TRB\nactivities,\nTCRP\nproject\npanels\nserve\nvoluntarily\nwithout\ncompensation.\nBecause research cannot have the desired impact if products fail to\nreach the intended audience, special emphasis is placed on\ndisseminating TCRP results to the intended endusers of the research:\ntransit agencies, service providers, and suppliers. TRB provides a\nseries of research reports, syntheses of transit practice, and other\nsupporting material developed by TCRP research. APTA will\narrange for workshops, training aids, field visits, and other activities\nto ensure that results are implemented by urban and rural transit\nindustry practitioners.\nThe TCRP provides a forum where transit agencies can\ncooperatively address common operational problems. The TCRP\nresults support and complement other ongoing transit research and\ntraining programs.\nTCRP REPORT 8\nProject F-3 FY '92\nISSN 1073-4872\nISBN 0-309-05711-6\nLibrary of Congress Catalog Card No. 95-62100\nPrice $25.00\nNOTICE\nThe project that is the subject of this report was a part of the Transit\nCooperative Research Program conducted by the Transportation Research\nBoard with the approval of the Governing Board of the National Research\nCouncil.

This guidebook distills the\nfindings of the research project into \"how to\" tips and examples that focus on the three\nphases of TQM implementation: the foundation phase, the momentum phase, and the\ncommitment phase. This guidebook will be of interest to managers, labor leaders, and\nmembers of governing boards who have an interest in applying the principles of TQM to\npublic transportation.\nThe intent of this research was to identify, evaluate, and recommend applications of\npotentially successful methods of implementing TQM in public transportation to increase\nridership through improved customer satisfaction, to increase productivity, and to reduce\ncost. The research was undertaken because there was no significant and systematic effort\nwithin the transit industry to evaluate applications of TQM, to disseminate information\nregarding successful strategies, and to develop a body of practical resources specifically\ndesigned for transit.\nUnder TCRP Project F-3, MacDorman & Associates, Inc. thoroughly researched the\nTQM literature, and provided summaries of the essential principles of TQM, including\nthe basic tenets of TQM as developed by proponents such as W. Edwards Deming,\nJoseph Juran, Kaoru Ishikawa, Armand Feigenbaum, and Philip Crosby. It contains\ndetails of four pilot TQM initiatives that were supported and observed during the project,\nthe findings of a survey of transportation industry chief executive officers, and the\nfindings of a survey of transit agencies that have undertaken quality initiatives and\nefforts. Case studies of Baldrige Award winners outside of the public transit field are\nprovided, as well as case studies of TQM efforts in the transit industry: Madison,\nWisconsin, METRO; Montgomery County, Maryland, Ride-On; and Port Authority of\nAllegheny County, Pennsylvania.\nOver the course of a year, the research team worked with four transit agencies that\nhad begun TQM initiatives of some type and expressed an interest in participating in this\nTCRP project: Chicago Transit Authority, Pee Dee Regional Transportation Authority,\nSouthwest Ohio Regional Transit Authority, and Spokane Transit Authority. The four\nagencies were selected by the project panel from 30 transit agencies that expressed\ninterest and satisfied the selection criteria. These sites represent transit agencies of\nvarious sizes in different regions of the United States. The research team provided\ntechnical assistance and guidance in how to avoid pitfalls that had sidetracked earlier\nTQM efforts elsewhere, and then conducted before and after employee surveys and\nmanagement interviews to determine if TQM was having a positive effect. Although one\nyear is not enough time to dramatically change an organization, there is no question that\npositive changes occurred at the pilot transit agencies, particularly in improved labor-\nmanagement communication.\n\nand the feeling that employees can have an effect on their work environment and on the\nquality of transit service that their agency delivers.\nThe TQM guidebook is supplemented by an unpublished agency report prepared under\nthe project entitled, Total Quality Management in Public Transportation. A video\nentitled, Four Views from the Road: Public Transportation's Quality Journey, was also\nprepared. The video features drivers, mechanics, managers, and labor representatives\ndescribing the positive changes in their transit organizations as a result of applying TQM\nprinciples. A pocket-sized brochure is available entitled, The Quality Journey: An\nOverview of TQM in Public Transportation. The brochure features quotations from some\nof the same people featured in the video. A limited number of final reports and brochures\nare available on a loan basis from TCRP. The video is available from the American\nPublic Transit Association. Inquiries regarding the video should be addressed to:\nTCRP Dissemination\nAmerican Public Transit Association\n1201 New York Avenue, N.W.\nWashington, D.C. 20005\nFAX (202) 898-4019\nInternet HTTP://www.apta.com/tcrp\n\nPREFACE\nAs we near the end of the 20th century, many of our traditional business practices seem\nincreasingly less effective. They haven't kept pace with changing demographic patterns\nand employee expectations, shifting societal demands, increasing competition coupled\nwith increasing fiscal constraints, and the need to adopt new technologies. To meet these\nbroad challenges, growing numbers of American businesses have adopted the principles of\nTotal Quality Management (TQM) to improve the responsiveness of their products and\nservices. For many, following these principles resulted in changes to the core of the\nbusiness that, in turn, increased customer and employee satisfaction, reduced costs, and\nimproved productivity.\nThe transit industry faces many of the same challenges as other 20th-century businesses.\nThe principles of TQM appear to hold promise as a way to improve transit service,\nincrease ridership, and fulfill the transit industry's broad social mission. However, only a\nfew agencies have introduced innovative TQM-based practices. There is no significant\nand systematic effort within the industry to evaluate applications of TQM, to disseminate\ninformation regarding successful strategies, and to develop a body of practical resources\nspecifically designed for transit. Transit agencies need guidance on and methods for\nimplementing TQM in the public transportation environment.\nResearch Background\nThis document was prepared under Transit Cooperative Research Program (TCRP)\nProject F-3, \"Total Quality Management in Public Transportation.\" The objectives of the\nproject were to identify, evaluate, and recommend applications of potentially successful\nmethods of implementing TQM in public transportation. We particularly looked for\nmethods that held promise for increasing ridership, improving customer satisfaction,\nincreasing productivity, and reducing costs.\nTo meet these objectives, the project (1) identified the essential TQM principles,\nconcepts, and values in the context of the transit industry; (2) reviewed relevant TQM\napplications and practices from inside and outside the transit industry; (3) designed,\nimplemented, and evaluated the initiation of the TQM process at four transit system's\nsites; (4) reported on the effectiveness of all identified practices and processes; and (5)\nrecommended follow-up activities. All project activities are reported in the Final Research\nReport.\nPilot Transit Systems\nFour transit systems participated in TQM as pilot sites:\n°\nChicago Transit Authority (CTA)--one of the largest rail and bus transit systems in\nthe United States.\n°\nPee Dee Regional Transportation Authority (PDRTA)--a multicounty, mostly rural,\nsoutheastern U.S. system, which largely provides paratransit services.\n\nHOW TO USE\nTHIS GUIDEBOOK\n°\nSouthwest Ohio Regional Transit Authority (SORTA)--a mid- to large-sized bus\nservice in the midwest.\n°\nSpokane Transit Authority (STA)--a mid-sized, West Coast bus and paratransit\nsystem.\nThe four shared an interest in TQM but were at different stages in its implementation,\nranging from no prior involvement to about 2 years of experimentation with employee\nparticipation and other TQM principles.\nSources of TQM Information\nThis guidebook cites numerous sources of information that will be vital in learning\nmore about TQM. In addition to this guidebook, other products produced by this TCRP\nproject include:\n°\nFour Views from the Road: Public Transportation's Quality Journey a (23-minute\nvideo of TQM described by transit's people).\n°\n\"Total Quality Management in Public Transportation,\" Final Research Report, Project\nF-3, July 20, 1995 (an unpublished report of all project research findings and results).\n°\nThe Quality Journey: An Overview of TQM in Public Transportation (a pocket-sized\nbrochure).\n°\n\"Total Quality Management in Public Transportation,\" TCRP Research Results\nDigest 3, October 1994 (an abbreviated report of Phase I research findings and\nresults).\nSee Foreword for information on obtaining these products.\nThis guidebook can be used like a roadmap to help a transit organization plan its quality\njourney. It provides a high-level picture of the terrain, a few specific examples from the\nfour pilot transit systems, a variety of tips, and additional resources keyed to stages of the\njourney. Remember, this view of the terrain is from 30,000 feet above the ground. It will\nhelp keep you oriented in the right direction, but you'll need more support from the\nsuggested resources to complete various activities. We've included examples to inspire\nyour creativity. They are not prescriptions, nor are they the only way to approach these\napplications. Ultimately, each organization chooses its own path to Total Quality\nManagement (TQM).\nWe recommend that you first read, or at least skim, the entire guidebook to gain an\noverall perspective of the TQM journey. Then do a more focused reading of the phase\nthat's most relevant to your organization. For most transit organizations, that will be the\nFoundation Phase. As your work progresses, review the guidebook periodically to find the\nmost relevant examples, tips, and resources. Share it with others in your organization as\nthey embark on various TQM activities. Each of the chapters is briefly described below.\nChapter 1--An Introduction to Total Quality Management (TQM). This chapter\noutlines the guiding principles that underlie the specific practices in TQM. It also provides\nan overview of the three progressive but overlapping phases that characterize most quality\njourneys.\nChapters 2, 3, and 4 are your roadmap. Each presents one of the three phases as well as\nits supporting activities. Each phase builds capabilities and knowledge, within your\norganization, that will be called on in the following phases. Skipping immediately to the\nCommittment Phase may set your organization up for failure. We recommend that you\nfollow these phases in their broad outlines. Feel free, however, to experiment with actions\nfrom later phases in earlier ones, if those actions seem to fit your needs.\nChapter 2--Foundation Phase. The key to this phase is bringing senior management\nand labor together to learn about TQM and to jointly set a course of action. This solid\n\nbase of cooperation establishes momentum for TQM. Without it, an organization will\nflounder.\nChapter 3--Momentum Phase. Through the activities in this phase, your organization\nwill create living, concrete, and specific examples of the generic TQM values of customer\nfocus, employee involvement, continuous improvement, and leadership. Through these\nexamples, the people in your organization will begin to understand TQM and believe that it\ncan work for them. These beliefs build cultural momentum and that will help ensure the\nsupport for TQM that is a prerequisite for a successful Commitment Phase.\nChapter 4--Commitment Phase. Activities in this phase help change an organization's\nformal structures, systems, and accountabilities. For example, an organization might change\nthe way it maintains vehicles by implementing self-managed teams of mechanics responsible\nfor a particular set of vehicles. Activities in this phase will provide the greatest payoff for an\norganization in terms of increased ridership, improved productivity, and reduced costs. These\nactivities will also help ensure ongoing organizational improvement. Remember, however,\nthat these changes are potentially deep and broad in their reach. To make them successful, an\norganization needs a strong base of labor-management cooperation and cultural momentum\nbuilt in the earlier two phases.\nChapter 5--Leadership: The TQM Driver. This chapter outlines key leadership\nresponsibilities for each phase and discusses leadership development.\nAppendix A--Quality Resources. This section provides a listing of suggested books and\nother resources to assist with your quality journey. Recommended books keyed to specific\nroadmap actions also appear at the end of each activity description.\nAppendix B--Quality Glossary. This section will help you understand some of the terms\nused in the roadmap.\nGood luck on your journey.\n\nCONTENTS\nCHAPTER 1 An Introduction to Total Quality Management (TQM)\nWhat is TQM?, 1\nTQM Principles, 2\nTQM Practices: Introduction to the Roadmap, 3\nCHAPTER 2 Foundation Phase\nPrepare for TQM, 7\nForm the Leadership Team, 8\nDiscuss TQM Goals, Build Awareness, and Enlist Support, 12\nClarify Organizational Vision, Mission, Goals, and Values, 13\nIdentify Customer Satisfaction Perceptions, Priorities, and Problems, 16\nSponsor and Launch Improvement Projects, 19\nCHAPTER 3\nMomentum Phase\n\nClarify Leadership Expectations, 21\nRenew an Emphasis on Employee Training and Development, 22\nRecognize, Reward, and Celebrate Contribution, 24\nIdentify and Initiate High-Priority Improvements, 25\nRevitalize the \"Suggestion System,\" 27\nEvaluate and Revise Policies and Practices to Eliminate Bureaucracy and\nEmpower Employees, 28\nEvaluate and Improve the Quality Process, 28\nCHAPTER 4\nCommitment Phase\n\nEstablish Process Management, 34\nReengineer Work Processes and Job Responsibilities, 35\nImplement Supplier Management and Partnerships, 38\nEvaluate and Improve the Measurement System, 39\nEvaluate and Improve the Management Performance Appraisal System, 40\nInstitute a System of \"Organized Abandonment,\" 41\nCHAPTER 5 Leadership: The TQM Driver\nKey Leadership Responsibilities, 43\nLeadership Development, 44\nAPPENDIX A Quality Resources\nAPPENDIX B Quality Glossary\n\nCOOPERATIVE RESEARCH PROGRAMS STAFF\nROBERT J.

Edwards Deming\n\"It requires a lot of work along the way\"\n-- George Kettenton, President,\nATU Local 1015 & Coach Operator, STA\nWHAT IS TQM?\nTQM stands for Total Quality Management, one of many approaches designed to reform\nAmerican business and commerce. You may have heard or used terms like Visioning, Shared\nInterests, Reengineering, or Reinventing. These approaches and activities are also part of this\nbroad reform movement. Today, change is sweeping through American business and commerce\nand -- yes -- even through the public transportation industry! What the change is called is not as\nimportant as what the change is about. The TQM change is about how organizations perform\nwork, satisfy customers, get better at what they do, and -- perhaps most important of all -- how\nthey inspire, reward, and retain the people who make them tick. As you learn about TQM through\nthis guidebook, you'll probably find that many of its components are familiar. What's special\nabout TQM is how it embraces and combines many existing management and organizational\nphilosophies.\nTQM is a comprehensive and long-term transformational process. As a result of this process, an\norganization moves from a traditional, outdated mode of operating to a newer, more progressive\nway of running the enterprise (see the following table). Along the way, the organization learns\nhow to change, improve, and evolve continuously. It does this by focusing on people first -- in\nparticular, on passengers, employees, and people in the community. Systems, procedures,\nstructure, measures, and responsibilities are transformed to support the employee's desire to serve\nthe passenger and the community.\n\nOrganizational Characteristics\nTQM PRINCIPLES\n\"It's an ongoing process...you need to improve and do everything\nyou can to bring about customer satisfaction\"\n--\nDianne Todd,\nPresident of the Drivers' Council\nand Senior Driver, PDRTA\nYou can't implement TQM by rigidly following a recipe. Your organization and situation will\nhave unique elements, and you must modify existing approaches or develop new ones to fit your\nneeds. The following seven principles will help you in this:\n°\nPut Customers First. \"Putting customers first\" is the basis for all quality management. An\norganization that practices TQM believes that service and product quality should meet, and\nhopefully exceed, customers' expectations. Each person and every work process in that\norganization has a clear role under this goal. The success of public transportation depends on\nattracting and retaining customers to use and support its services.\n°\nManage and Improve Processes. Within the quality movement, the word \"process\" refers to\nhow work activities are performed. By improving processes, organizations can raise the\nquality of their services, products, and delivery. They can also increase productivity, improve\noperational efficiency, and eliminate waste. Process management involves all activities\nrequired to provide a product or service, including support activities such as maintenance,\nservice planning, and training.\n\n°\nManage by Fact. An organization that practices TQM relies on facts and data to support its\ndecisions and operations. For example, it may use market research to confirm ideas about\ncustomers' expectations. It may document its work processes to set a baseline for improving\nthem. It will measure itself in areas vital to customers, for example, on-time performance.\nMeasurements serve the dual role of 1) helping managers set the direction for operational and\nstrategic planning and 2) providing feedback on how well and how quickly organizational\ngoals and objectives are being achieved.\n°\nCultivate Organizational Learning. Continuous improvement in customer satisfaction and\noperational performance requires commitment to learning. Without learning, organizations\nand their members repeat old behaviors and practices. Solving problems, changing\nprocedures to meet customers' changing needs, understanding the importance of satisfying\ncustomers, and designing or reengineering processes all require learning that work can be\nperformed in different, better ways.\n°\nTrain, Empower, and Recognize Employees. Employees are a transit system's most\nimportant asset. Their value must be protected and enhanced. This means training employees\nto identify and solve problems that cause customer dissatisfaction, empowering employees to\ntake actions that satisfy customers, and recognizing employees for efforts and contributions\nthat improve performance.\n°\nImprove Labor-Management Teamwork. A continuous and lasting TQM initiative requires\nthe involvement of employees. In organizations with unions and represented employees, this\nmeans union officials must be involved in quality policy decision-making. Employee teams\nmust have both represented and non-represented members in order to solve problems and\nincrease customer satisfaction.\n°\nLead the Change in Organizational Culture. Leadership and organizational culture are\ncritical to the success of TQM. Total Quality Management represents a long-term\ncommitment. It is not a fad or a quick fix but a fundamental change in the workplace.\nCreating a change of this kind requires leadership at all levels and takes years of sustained\neffort.\nTest your ideas for implementation against these principles. Good ideas will be good reflectors of\none or more principles.\nTQM PRACTICES: INTRODUCTION TO THE ROADMAP\n\"The major failing of any quality initiative is passion without\nsystem or system without passion, you must have both\"\n-- Tom Peters\nOnce leaders in a traditional organization are convinced of TQM's principles and desired\noutcomes, the question becomes, \"How do we get started?\" The roadmap presented in this\nguidebook is designed to help organizations get started and continue with the transition to full\nTQM. In our view, the most successful transitions to full TQM occur in three progressive phases.\nEach phase builds capabilities and knowledge, within an organization, that will support the\nfollowing phases. Skipping immediately to the last phase may set an organization up for failure.\nWe recommend that you follow these three phases in their broad outline. Feel free, however, to\nexperiment with actions from later phases in earlier ones, if those actions seem to fit your needs.\nUltimately, you will choose your own path of transformation. The following table provides an\noverview of the phases and associated actions. Use this guidebook and recommended readings for\nmore detail on specific actions.\n\nGetting started with TQM may go more slowly than you might wish. That's not unusual and not a\nsign that your organization is not \"right\" for TQM. Remember, a large part of an organization is\nits behavior patterns or habits. Organizational habits, like personal ones, are difficult to change,\nespecially when everyone is trying just to keep up with the ever-increasing demands of getting\nthings done.\nTQM Roadmap Summary\n\nAs you move into the Foundation Phase, attend to the following do's and don'ts for a good start.\nDo's\nV Involve union leadership from the beginning.\nV Form a leadership team to provide direction and formulate a TQM action plan.\nV Create and staff a quality manager position to ensure the expertise and support you'll need.\nV Enlist support from middle management early.\nV Work with those who want to lead the change.\nV Create examples of success.\nV Be patient as well as persistent.\nDon'ts\nU Abdicate leadership responsibility.\nU Discuss wages, work hours, or working conditions in quality initiative meetings or\ndeliberations -- these issues are reserved, by law, for unions and collective bargaining.\nU Dwell on internal problems like improving morale or reducing absenteeism -- instead, DO\nfocus on the customer.\nU Promise what TQM can ultimately deliver as if you'll have it next week -- the TQM process\nmust be capable of delivering on your enthusiasm.\nU Handpick members of Quality Improvement Teams (QITs) -- DO support open, voluntary\nemployee involvement with public criteria for team participation.\nU Get discouraged -- some quality initiatives will fail -- DO create an environment of\nexperimentation.\nTo return to the quote from Tom Peters that opened this chapter, it's up to the leadership to supply\nthe \"passion\" for quality. The TQM journey will demand your enthusiasm, resolve, and sense of\nurgency to make progress -- in short, your \"passion.\" The TQM process, the roadmap outlined in\nthis guidebook, and your TQM action plan will provide the \"system\" that channels this energy for\npositive change.\nThe following chapters outline the TQM phases and their suggested actions in more detail and\ninclude examples provided by TQM pilot studies at the Chicago Transit Authority (CTA), the\nSouthwest Ohio Regional Transit Authority (SORTA), the Pee Dee Regional Transportation\nAuthority (PDRTA), and the Spokane Transit Authority (STA). Use the examples to inspire your\ncreativity. They are not prescriptions, nor are they the only way to approach these applications.\nWhen you need more detail on how to do an activity, consult the recommended resources.\n\nThis page left intentionally blank.\n\nFOUNDATION PHASE\n\"A journey of one thousand miles begins with a single step\"\n-- Lao Tsu\nThe key to this phase is bringing senior management and labor together to learn about TQM and\nto set jointly a course of action. This solid base of cooperation establishes momentum for TQM.\nWithout it, an organization will flounder. Each of the activities below, which help build the\nfoundation for TQM, is discussed in more detail in this section:\n°\nPreparing for TQM\n°\nForming the leadership team\n°\nDiscussing TQM goals, building awareness, and enlisting support\n°\nClarifying organizational vision, mission, goals, and values\n°\nIdentifying customer satisfaction perceptions, priorities, and problems\n°\nSponsoring and launching improvement projects\nThe first two activities, preparing for TQM and forming the leadership team, should be done\nbefore the others. The remaining activities can be done simultaneously or in any order that suits\nyour organization.\nPREPARE FOR TQM\nBefore convening the leadership team, senior leaders (both union and management) need a basic\ngrounding in and knowledge of TQM. To prepare themselves to lead the TQM initiative, senior\nleaders should:\n°\nLearn about quality -- Review the Four Views From the Road video, this guidebook,\nsuggested references, and this project's final report, \"Total Quality Management in Public\nTransportation\" (see the Preface for ordering information).\n°\nPromote quality awareness with their colleagues in management, labor, and the governing\nboard.\n°\nEnlist quality expertise and support -- Create and staff a quality manager position that reports\ndirectly to the Chief Executive Officer (CEO). Ideally, this individual will provide both\nquality expertise and staff support for the TQM initiative. You'll need expertise to stay clear\nof pitfalls early in your journey as well as to facilitate your TQM knowledge and leadership.\nYou'll need staff support to help manage the details of the TQM process, provide behind-the\nscenes glue, and be a resource to teams embarking on various quality initiatives. If, however,\nthe person you hire does not have at least three years of TQM experience, enlist the services\nof an experienced TQM consultant to provide quality expertise.\n\nThe Quality Manager is typically a middle manager who has the\nfollowing characteristics:\n°\nA broad knowledge of the transit business\n°\nA lot of energy and initiative\n°\nExcellent skills in dealing with people and facilitating meetings\n°\nEither TQM expertise OR is a quick study and willing to learn from others\nIn addition, a Quality Manager should be well respected by senior managers and front-line\nemployees and known for thinking and acting in alignment with the seven TQM principles.\nRESOURCES\n°\nDeming, W.E., Out of the Crisis, 1982.\n°\nImai, M., Kaizen: The Key to Japan's Competitive Success, 1986.\n°\nJuran, J.M., Juran on Leadership for Quality: An Executive Handbook, 1989.\n°\nPeters, T.J., Thriving on Chaos: Handbook for a Management Revolution, 1987.\n°\nFour Views From the Road: Public Transportation's Quality Journey (a 23-minute video of\nTQM described by transit's people)\n°\nThe Quality Journey: An Overview of TQM in Public Transportation (a pocket-sized\nbrochure)\n°\n\"Total Quality Management in Public Transportation,\" Final Research Report, Project F-3,\nJuly 20, 1995 (a full report of all project research findings and results)\n°\n\"Total Quality Management in Public Transportation,\" TCRP Research Results Digest 3,\nOctober 1994 (an abbreviated report of Phase I research findings and results).\nFORM THE LEADERSHIP TEAM\n\"Labor and management are both participants\nand that makes a big, big difference\"\n-- Jerry Williams, President, ATU Local 308\nWithout direction and leadership, TQM will go nowhere fast. Don't make one of these two\ncommon, and costly, mistakes!\nU When union employees are present, don't exclude union leadership from the leadership team.\nU Don't delegate leadership of the TQM effort to anyone else, not even to the Quality Manager.\nForm a leadership team that includes senior management and union leadership and make sure\nthat the team knows its charter. In a non-union environment, include front-line employees with\nleadership qualities. This leadership team must provide direction, leadership, and continuity for\nthe TQM process. At the outset, the team members will need to learn more about TQM, both as\nindividuals and as a team. Then, as a team, they'll establish goals for TQM in their organization,\ncreate a TQM action plan to accomplish the goals, and enlist support for the overall TQM\nprocess.\nAlthough the team may think its work is done after it's created an action plan, in fact, its work is\nonly beginning. To put the plan into action, each of the TQM initiatives needs a sponsor, and the\nsponsor should be a member of the leadership team. The role of the sponsor is that of a\n\nmentor -- ensuring that employees who carry out the initiative can succeed and feel ownership\nfor what they did and its outcome.\nAs architects of the quality journey, the leadership team will have to adapt and refine the TQM\naction plan as time goes on. The leadership team must also ensure that employees are involved in\ndeveloping the details of the action plan. Involvement normally begins with middle managers,\nwho review the initial plan and provide input. After that, to get the input and involvement of\nsupervisors, front-line employees, and others, the leadership team can use focus groups, staff\nmeetings, briefing sessions, and other means of two-way communication. The key here is \"two\nway communication.\" The best action plans reflect the insights and ideas of many employees\nfrom all parts of the organization.\nThe first meeting of the leadership team typically marks the official beginning of an\norganization's quality journey. In this meeting, senior management and senior labor convene for\none to two days to create a common language and develop the initial TQM action plan. Although\nthe organization's senior leadership may not be a true team going into the first meeting, it should\nbe a team coming out of it -- willing to give TQM a go -- willing to learn more about TQM as a\ngroup, and what it means to be a leadership team.\nObjectives for a leadership teams launch meeting typically include:\n°\nLearning more about quality principles and practices\n°\nDeveloping TQM goals\n°\nDeveloping a TQM action plan of the steps that will begin to achieve these goals (using this\nroadmap)\n°\nScheduling regular leadership team meetings\nThe biggest pitfall early in the TQM journey is for management to go it alone\nwithout involving senior labor officials. In some cases, a session on shared interests\n(as described for CTA in the third example below) may be needed to pave the way\nfor TQM.\nEXAMPLE\nAgenda for a leadership team launch meeting (1-2 days)\n°\nDiscuss expectations, today's objectives, agenda, ground rules\n°\nDo a warm-up activity\n°\nView and discuss the Four Views From the Road video\n°\nTeam Discussion: \"What Does Quality Mean to You?\"\n°\nHear about TQM principles\n°\nHear from guest speakers relating their experiences with TQM\n°\nReview highlights of TQM roadmap using this guidebook\n°\nTeam Activity: \"Create Our Quality Vision -- TQM Goals\"\n°\nTeam Activity: \"Create Our High-Level Action Plan\"\n°\nHear about roles of leadership and the leadership team\n°\nDiscuss next steps, leadership team meeting schedule\n°\nEvaluate the meeting\n\nEXAMPLE\nAction plan for TQM from PDRTA\n°\nCreate a Quality Council - Responsibilities will include selecting, supporting, and overseeing\nQITs and task forces, which implement TQM initiatives. The Council will hold regular\nmeetings and collect and report findings to the entire organization.\n°\nCommunicate Senior Management's Commitment - Commitment should be reinforced at\nevery possible occasion, including through actions and written memos.\n°\nDevelop Mission, Vision, and Values Statements - The Quality Council will lead this effort,\nbut employee involvement is also essential for ownership.\n°\nConduct Customer Satisfaction Research - Use customer focus groups, on-board interviews\nand surveys, and front-line employee knowledge of customers.\n°\nSolicit Improvement Suggestions From Employees - Use focus groups and suggestion\nsystems to gain information from employees regarding customer satisfaction, performance\nimprovements, and ideas about the mission, vision, and values statements.\n°\nDevelop a List of High-Priority Projects and Select QITs - The Quality Council will rank\nimprovement proposals on the basis of importance to customer and organizational priorities.\nQITs will be established to carry out improvements. The teams will be afforded time and\nsupported by the Quality Council.\n°\nHave QITs Conduct Quality Improvement Projects - QITs will receive training on the\nquality process and tools, will clarify their problems/issues with the Quality Council, analyze\nroot causes of the problems, and recommend solutions to the Quality Council.\n°\nDevelop and Conduct a Series of TQM Orientation Sessions - A TQM orientation, which\nincludes TQM principles, mission, vision, values, goals, and this quality action plan, will be\ngiven to all employees.\n°\nDevelop Ongoing Customer Complaint and Employee Suggestion System - Data can be\nobtained through a complaint form or card, suggestion box, or other mechanisms. Complaints\nand suggestions will be discussed regularly at improvement meetings.\n°\nIntegrate Discussion of Survey, Suggestion, and Complaint Data into Regular Performance\nMeetings.\nEXAMPLE\nSession on shared interests in conjunction with the CTA leadership team\nlaunch: Goal was to recognize shared interests between union leadership\nand senior management.\nShared Interests of Union and Management\n\nCTA held a union-management retreat attended by 14 union leaders (representing the\nAmalgamated Transit Union [ATU] Locals 241 and 308 and the Metal Trades) and 12 senior\nmanagers. The retreat included sessions on customer problems, separate and shared interests, and\ndeveloping a vision statement. One output was the preceding diagram, which represents the key\nshared interests of union and management. This meeting spawned four subcommittees whose\nmembership included leadership and representatives from a larger population of employee leaders\nat CTA. These subcommittees provided follow-through in detailing how the shared interests\nconverge to support delivery of excellent, consistent customer service.\nManaging Meetings - As a leadership team, strive to create a model of meeting\neffectiveness and efficiency by example. If you succeed in improving your own\nmeetings, eventually, the entire organization will learn how to hold effective\nmeetings. A little discipline will go a long way. Establish meeting ground rules and\nuse other meeting management tools. Examples of ground rules for meetings:\n°\nEnsure that all meetings have objectives, an agenda, and an ending time.\n°\nEnsure that all meetings and breaks start and end on time.\n°\nParticipate, don't dominate.\n°\nHear from each person.\n°\nDon't pull rank.\n°\nDon't rehash old issues without new facts.\n°\nDon't allow personal attacks.\n°\nClarify action items, due dates, and ownership.\n°\nAgree to thumbs-up or thumbs-sideways consensus on decisions -- Thumbs-up means \"I\nagree\"; thumbs-down means \"I disagree,\" i.e., \"You have not got my vote\"; and thumbs-\nsideways means \"I can support the decision but have the following reservations for\nimprovement,\" i.e., this is not a show-stopper.\nAdditional Meeting Management Tips:\n°\nEnforce ground rules by having violators pay a small penalty.\n°\nHave the group responsible for calling a violation as soon as one occurs, and make sure the\nviolator pays the penalty immediately.\n°\nAvoid taking off on a tangent by using a \"parking lot\" for issues of concern that are not\ncentral to the day's work. Write those issues down and post them, then revisit them before the\nmeeting concludes.\n°\nEstablish roles for a facilitator and a scribe. Designate these responsibilities at the outset of\nthe meeting. The facilitator attends to team dynamics, time, and anything else about the way\nthe group works. The scribe ensures important issues and action items are recorded and\nvalidated by the group.\n°\nGet more done by having subgroups complete tasks outside the full team meeting.\n°\nGet rid of the chairs! When you're all standing, you'll be surprised at how efficient your\nmeeting can become.\nRESOURCES\n°\nAT&T Quality Library, Leading the Quality Initiative, Select Code 500-441, 1990.\n°\nBrassard, M. and Ritter, D., The Memory Jogger II, GOAL/QPC, 1994.\n°\nCohen-Rosenthal, E., and Burton, C.E., Mutual Gains: A Guide to Union-Management\nCooperation, 1993.\n\nDISCUSS TQM GOALS, BUILD AWARENESS, & ENLIST\nSUPPORT\n\"It takes everyone in the company to make the company run.\nIt can't be just management, it can't be just worker, it can't\nbe just union. It's got to be everyone\"\n-- Lettie Robinson,\nExecutive Board Member, ATU Local 241\nTo enlist support for the TQM goals and action plan, the leadership team must communicate\nthem and build awareness. This is an opportunity to set a new standard for effective internal\ncommunications. Don't blow it with a business-as-usual memo. The most effective\ncommunication is through frank, open, face-to-face discussions. Just get out there and listen.\nIt's also important to use a wide variety of means to communicate. Try focus groups, for example.\nInvolve managers, supervisors, and union officials in getting the dialogue going -- and keep\ncycling back for updates and continued dialogue. If you also use this opportunity to encourage\nemployee suggestions and put them into action, you'll lead by doing. Actions like these will\neventually be every supervisor's responsibility. As the TQM journey proceeds, continue to\ncommunicate with a wide variety of means. Try team storyboards, scoreboards, one page TQM\nupdates, etc., to let people know what is happening and to generate dialogue.\nReach out widely to enlist a broad base of support early in the TQM process.\nInvolve as many key managers, supervisors, and union leaders as you can in\nshaping the TQM goals and action plan. Encourage them to participate in early\ninitiatives and projects, and recognize their leadership when they come through\nfor you.\nEXAMPLE\nEnlisting support at STA\nLeadership Team Quality Vision: \"A commitment to exceed customer expectations by\nempowering employees and continuous improvement\"\nThe leadership team used their draft of a quality vision to communicate their intent and to solicit\nfeedback from employees. They presented their vision informally at staff meetings and included\nit as part of more formal briefing sessions to first-line supervisors, middle managers, and union\nstewards. During each of the briefing sessions, in addition to the quality vision, participants\nlearned about the principles of TQM as well as the leadership team's initial action plan.\nParticipants' ideas for possible quality improvements were solicited via \"brainstorming,\" a\ncreative thinking technique for groups.\nAt each briefing session, volunteers were solicited to work with members of the leadership team\non one of three subcommittees. One subcommittee selected improvement projects to be\naddressed by QITs. Another subcommittee explored the best ways to receive customer input and\nlearn about what customers expect, how they perceive the organization, and how important\nvarious aspects of the service were to them. The third committee was responsible for addressing\nthe best ways to receive employee input concerning quality issues and initiatives.\n\nCLARIFY ORGANIZATIONAL VISION, MISSION, GOALS, &\nVALUES\n\"You have to be very careful if you don't know where you\nare going because you might not get there\"\n-- Yogi Berra\nClarifying organizational vision, mission, goals, and values is an early priority of the leadership\nteam. All too easily this can degenerate into a meaningless exercise. It should be a visceral,\ndynamic, ongoing conversation with the organization and its stakeholders.\nIf you did a thorough job in creating TQM goals, you should be on your way to answering the\nfollowing questions:\n°\n\"What will be our role in the future?\" This is your vision.\n°\n\"What is our purpose now?\" This is your mission.\n°\n\"What will we accomplish?\" These are your goals.\n°\n\"What do we believe and how will we act?\" These are your values.\nThis is one of your first opportunities to integrate the quality process into the fabric of the\norganization. Your TQM goals will likely encompass performance as well as culture in a general\nand inspiring way. Use these as your springboard to clarify organizational direction and desired\nvalues.\nThe organizational vision has to do with aspirations for the future. Will our mission be the same,\ni.e., Will we have the same purpose? Will we serve the same types of customers, in the same\nway? Will our relationship with the community be the same? Will we be in the business of\nrunning this system or providing for the mobility of people? Developing common answers to\nquestions of this kind requires broad, ongoing dialogue.\nMany transit agencies have a documented mission statement and accompanying goals. At a\nminimum, these are published with the annual report or in a planning document. Ideally, everyone\nshould be able to describe how he or she contributes to key organizational goals and to the\nmission of the agency. Test this by asking employees what the mission and goals mean to them. If\nyou get vague answers, you know you have lots of work ahead of you.\nGoals should be measurable, so that an organization beginning TQM can put a results-oriented\n\"stake in the ground\" and measure progress from there. The exercise of stating goals will help\nclarify the mission and vision. Generally speaking, long-term goals are at least three years out.\nLink them to shorter-term, one-year targets. An organization working toward TQM should set\ngoals around customer satisfaction, employee satisfaction, and financial performance.\nClarifying values is one of the most difficult areas for traditional organizations, yet it is one of the\nmost important when moving forward with TQM. Start by defining a set of common values. The\nvalues should be consistent with quality principles and may include items such as customer focus,\nrespect for the individual, integrity, teamwork, and innovation.\nMany organizations post a list of their values, but reinforcing and living the values distinguishes\norganizations that are truly on the TQM journey. It's up to the leaders to make this real. They can\ndo that, first, by discussing routinely how their own behavior reflects the values or falls short.\nThen, these discussions must bear fruit -- leaders must improve their behavior, so that it\n\ndoes become a better reflection of the desired values. Once leaders truly live the values in their\nown behavior, they will find they want to change policies, rules, and practices that are barriers to\nemployees' living the values as well.\nWhen leaders are ready to move beyond their personal behavior in living the values, they must\nplan for reinforcing the values in the organization. It's best to view this, too, as a long-term\nlearning process and to start informally. Have work groups \"check in\" periodically to evaluate\nwhat actions and behaviors have been consistent and inconsistent with the common values. For\nexample, include this as a standing agenda item at leadership team meetings. Then move to more\nformal methods.\nMany organizations have implemented a formal feedback system for managers, in which each\nmanager's subordinates, colleagues, and superiors periodically provide anonymous feedback on\nhow well his or her behaviors and management style conform to the common values. Often\ncalled \"360-degree feedback,\" this system can be a powerful tool for helping an organization\nlearn to live the values. After extensive experience with a system like this, an organization can\nmove on to including an evaluation of \"living the values\" as part of the formal performance\nappraisal. Throughout the entire learning process, be sure to use positive reinforcement, both\ninformal and formal, to thank employees for \"walking the talk.\"\nEXAMPLE\nVision, mission, and values at PDRTA\nVision Statement -- \"PDRTA will be the nation's best rural paratransit provider, offering\nefficient on-demand and scheduled services to Pee Dee citizens.

One-day seminars have been held with\nnumerous work groups throughout Metro. The seminar engages the group in creating its own\nvision statement that articulates the group's priorities and underscores its values. Over time, the\nvision statements of all groups were combined and synthesized into an overall Metro vision\norganized according to four organizational pillars.\n\nMETRO VISION\n°\nWe make Cincinnati a great place to live -- Metro improves the overall quality of life in Greater\nCincinnati. Our actions assure that there is an ongoing, vital role for transit in our community. We\nare transportation pioneers, making decisions based on the community's long-range transportation\nneeds. We are widely recognized for our work and have strong community support and secure\nregional funding.\n°\nCustomers are why we're here -- We are totally dedicated to exceeding our customers'\nexpectations. We know who our customers are and take them where they want to go. All of our\ncustomers are completely satisfied. Ridership increases steadily as we actively seek new customers.\nMetro is everyone's first choice in transportation.\n°\nOutstanding service is our commitment -- Metro is the world's leader in providing transit\nservices. We consistently exceed all standards of excellence and continuously improve. Our\ncustomers always receive safe, clean, dependable, friendly, convenient, accessible service. Our\ncommunications are outstanding; Metro information is readily available and easy to understand.\nRiding Metro is a pleasure.\n°\nEmployees are Metro; we are a team -- We are \"One Metro,\" an organization without barriers,\nworking as a team to achieve our vision of excellence. All employees and departments share a unity\nof purpose and clear direction. We support each other through mutual trust and respect. We\ncelebrate and reward each other's successes and foster innovation and risk-taking. We each take\nresponsibility for making things better and accept accountability. Employees are the foundation of\nMetro and our most valuable asset. We recruit and hire only the highest quality people. All\nemployees receive ongoing training and have state-of-the-art equipment and support systems. We\nhave fair, consistent policies and procedures, administered with flexibility and common sense. We\ncommunicate openly, honestly, and positively with each other. Information is shared freely. We\nengage in group decision-making and problem-solving. Each of us is a leader in making Metro the\nperfect place to work. All managers are consistent, committed, and concerned. Positive leadership\ninspires everyone's best work efforts and great relationships. We are happy, healthy, and highly\nmotivated. We love our jobs and have fun.\nAs one result of this unusually widespread vision process, a number of grassroots initiatives were\nsuggested by employees and are being supported by Metro management. By starting with work groups\nas multiple sources for the synthesized, overall vision, Metro leaders capitalized on employee\nenthusiasm for positive change and encouraged a culture of employee involvement.\nUse 360-degree feedback to help reinforce living the values. This is a formal\nfeedback system designed to help the person receiving the feedback develop his or\nher abilities to live the common values. Periodically, each manager's subordinates, colleagues,\nand superiors (sometimes even customers and suppliers) provide anonymous feedback on how\nwell his or her behaviors and management style conform to the common values. This system\ntypically uses a structured set of survey questions created around organizational values or other\nleadership behaviors. Results are tabulated and fed back to managers through a neutral third-\nparty. Managers are then asked to use this feedback to plan how they will develop and improve\npersonal leadership. This system is normally deployed first with top-level managers, then moved\ndown through the management ranks. Many organizations eventually include front-line\nemployees who interact with customers.\n\nRESOURCES\n°\nAT&T Quality Library, Policy Deployment Handbook, Select Code 500-453, 1992.\n°\nKing, B., Hoshin Planning - The Developmental Approach, GOAL/QPC, 1989.\n°\nLynch, R., Lead!

Without it, a TQM initiative can\ndegenerate into a series of disconnected efforts that may initially help employees \"feel good\"\nabout themselves but, in the long run, will create cynicism. Those employees who come to work\nevery day with a customer ethic may then wonder what all this TQM stuff is about.\nTo establish a customer focus, you must get information about your customers. There are two\nprimary sources of customer information:\n°\nThe customer\n°\nThe customer-facing front-line employee\nA good way to create a customer focus is to have employees develop and conduct customer\nsurveys. These surveys often take the form of \"customer report cards\" and can be administered\nthrough an interview process and/or using written surveys that are filled out by customers. The\nreport cards are used to get feedback on the most important aspects of service that affect overall\nperceptions of customer satisfaction. Surveys provide breadth of information.\nCustomer focus groups will provide information that complements what you learn from surveys.\nFocus groups are simply focused discussions among a small group of people, in this case,\ncustomers. You'll get much more detailed and richer information, i.e., depth, from a focus group\nthan from a report card. Many experts recommend using focus groups to refine a draft report card\nand to get feedback on a variety of specific issues. Key customer focus group questions include:\n°\nWhat are the most important aspects of our service?\n°\nHow satisfied are you with these aspects of service?\n°\nWhat do you like most about our service?\n°\nWhat do you like least about our service?\n°\nDo you have any suggestions on how we can serve you better?\nPost the results of customer satisfaction surveys and focus groups throughout the workplace.\nQuantitative ratings gained through report card surveys can be posted in the form of customer\nscoreboards. Qualitative results, in the form of quotes from customers can be categorized by key\naspects of your service and/or by service route. Some follow-up actions may be the responsibility\nof every employee in the course of a normal work day. Other actions may be delegated to QITs.\n\nFront-line employees who have lots of contact with customers are an invaluable source of\ncustomer information and ideas for improvements. Too many organizations put little or no\nemphasis on listening to front-line employees. To take advantage of this valuable resource, make\nsupervisors responsible for using employee input to improve customer service. Of course, you'll\nneed to support supervisors by providing needed training and reinforcement throughout.\nNot all departments and work groups have routine contact with external customers but every\ndepartment and work group has a \"customer,\" someone who needs and uses their work.\nMaintenance employees are serving the driver in addition to providing the passenger with a\nquality vehicle. The parts department serves the mechanics who rely on the availability of parts to\nsucceed at their job. By creating an understanding of \"internal\" customers, everyone knows how\nthey contribute to the larger team effort in a personal way - yet never losing sight of who the\noverall team serves - the passengers and the community.\nWhen developing a customer focus, start by thinking of the passenger as customer but don't stop\nthere. As you become more adept at TQM, you'll broaden your definition of customers to include\nmany others in addition to your current passengers. For example, consider the communities you\nserve, that is, the taxpayers. They are also your customers.\nConducting Focus Groups:\n°\nWhat - A focus group is a meeting, typically with 5 to 10 participants, who have a focused\ndiscussion on specific topics. It's used primarily to gather qualitative data.\n°\nHow long - One group typically lasts between one and two hours. There is no formal break.\n°\nSize - Seven participants is the ideal number.\n°\nNumber of groups - The typical advice is to conduct groups until the information gets\nrepetitive. In most cases, this happens after four to six focus groups.\n°\nFacilitator - Use a skilled, objective facilitator who has a prepared set of discussion\nquestions. This person should encourage everyone to build off of other's ideas and should\nmanage group dynamics.\n°\nCollecting data - A notetaker/scribe normally accompanies the facilitator. Ensure participant\nquotes are collected along with any quantitative ratings.\n°\nAnonymity - Assure participants full anonymity.\nEXAMPLE\nA Customer Report Card (and development process) from STA\nAfter reviewing and discussing market research reports, the team responsible for getting customer\ninput divided itself into three sub-teams, each addressing one of these areas: 1) design of the\nCustomer Report Card, 2) methods of collecting data, and 3) validation of customer responses.\nThe Report Card itself was pilot-tested and revised with real customer input. On-street customers\nin 30 service areas reviewed and commented on the sample report card. Then, 300 surveys were\npilot-tested on both fixed-route and paratransit services. The customer input team recruited 90\nfront-line employee volunteers to distribute customer report card surveys to transit passengers.\nEach volunteer received a TQM tote bag in appreciation of his or her efforts. More than 3,600\ncompleted survey forms were returned - a 65 percent rate of return! The customer survey results\nwere compiled by an outside market research firm, and a report was presented to the leadership\nteam and department managers. Poster-sized Customer Report Cards now hang in eight locations\nand are updated as new customer satisfaction data are collected.\n\nSpokane Transit Authority's Customer Report Card\nRESOURCES\n°\nAT&T Quality Library, Great Performances!

Try to ensure that your projects have a\ngood chance for success by carefully focusing them on specific problems or opportunities. Examples of\nmeaningful, customer-focused, concrete projects include reducing the number of vehicle breakdowns\nbecause of engine overheats or designing more user-friendly public schedules/timetables. Avoid broad\nand unfocused projects, for example, improving morale or reducing absenteeism. These are typically\nsymptoms of much larger problems, and the symptoms will remain until the root causes of the broader\nproblems have been attacked.\nTopics for improvement projects can be identified either by management or by employees. Eventually,\nyou'll want to have a mix of a few projects sponsored by senior leaders and a larger number of\ngrassroots efforts supported by local supervision. Most organizations use QITs to address improvement\nprojects. Don't handpick members of the QITs. Instead, support open, voluntary employee involvement\nwith public criteria for team participation. Ideally, you'll arrange for the QITs to get training or other\nsupport in using a team problem-solving process. QITs have the following characteristics:\n°\nAre best used for problems or improvement opportunities complex enough to warrant a team\nproblem-solving approach\n°\nDisband after the problem or opportunity has been addressed\n°\nHave members from departments and levels that have knowledge of or are affected by the problem\nor opportunity\n°\nHave a team leader who spearheads the effort, and may have a trained facilitator to guide the\nproblem-solving process and promote healthy group dynamics\n°\nMay have a team sponsor, usually a member of senior leadership or management. (The sponsor\nmentors the project, ensures that the QIT has needed resources, and helps remove potential\nroadblocks.)\nSponsoring and launching the first QITs is an opportunity to establish early victories resulting from\nemployee involvement. This is an important component of foundation building. You may prefer to wait\nfor Customer Report Card results and then use those results to help select the problems that QITs will\ntackle. Or you may choose to launch a few QITs right at the start of your TQM effort. Just be sure to\nfocus those on areas that clearly affect customers. In either case, it's best to start slow, with a few QITs\nfocused on relatively simple improvement projects. To build momentum for your TQM efforts, be sure\nto celebrate those early successes publicly.\nWhen the first wave of improvement projects comes to a close, be prepared to follow up with new\nprojects. Plan to broaden the base of employee involvement in the second wave of projects and, at the\nsame time, to take advantage of the employees who have gained experience in team problem-solving.\nThe second wave of improvement projects will carry the organization into the second phase of TQM,\nthe Momentum Phase. We'll say more about this later.\n\nAn effective QIT problem-solving process often has steps like the following:\n°\nClarify project goals and state them in measurable, concrete terms (e.g., reduce number of\nvehicle breakdowns due to engine overheating by 50 percent while keeping all other costs\nconstant)\n°\nBuild and lead the QIT that will solve the problem\n°\nAnalyze the problem and identify its most basic causes, called \"root causes\"\n°\nDevelop potential solutions and recommend or select the best one\n°\nDevelop a plan for implementing the solution\n°\nImplement the plan and define responsibility for ongoing improvement\n°\nCelebrate the QIT contribution\n°\nDisband QIT when the solution is self-sustaining\nAlthough some QITs will have a longer-term charter, most should make\nrecommendations for improvement within eight weeks. What ever the timeframe,\nall QITs should be encouraged to set deadlines, including intermediate\nmilestones, to maintain their focus.\nMost of the following useful tools and techniques for QITs are detailed in The\nMemory Jogger II (see the resources below):\n°\nBrainstorming and brainwriting to generate ideas\n°\nMultivoting to narrow choices to a manageable few\n°\nThumbs-up/thumbs-down/thumbs-sideways to facilitate group consensus\n°\nSurveys and checksheets to facilitate data gathering\n°\nFlowcharting to understand the current process and/or design a new process\n°\nCause and effect analysis to analyze causes, including potential root causes\n°\nGantt charts and other tools to help manage the problem-solving project\nEXAMPLE\nA selection process for QIT members\nAn employee committee created a volunteer process for QIT participation. The volunteer process\nwas designed to ensure that a QIT would have the expertise it needed without handpicking\nmembers. The committee first communicated the availability of two improvement projects\nthrough a variety of methods and then provided application forms to interested employees. The\nforms specified both the project objective and the types of employees (e.g., drivers and\nmaintenance supervisors) and their numbers whose expertise was needed to solve the problem.\nOn the same form, volunteers indicated why they were interested and what they might bring to\nthe effort. The employee committee (which represented a broad cross section of employees)\nselected each QIT member on the basis of volunteer applications.\nRESOURCES\n°\nBrassard, M. and Ritter, D., The Memory Jogger II, GOAL/QPC, 1994.\n°\nScholtes, P.R., The Team Handbook, 1988.\n\nMOMENTUM PHASE\n\"I am beginning to feel like I am part of an organization that\nis growing and that is changing. It's a way of life\"\n-- Marjorie Garza, Coach Operator, STA\nThrough the activities in this second phase of the TQM journey, the organization creates living\nexamples of the generic TQM values of customer focus, employee involvement, continuous\nimprovement, and leadership. Through these examples, the people in the organization will begin\nto understand TQM and believe that it can work for them. These beliefs build cultural momentum\nand that will help ensure the broad-based support for TQM needed for the third phase,\nCommitment. Each of the momentum-building activities listed below is described in more detail\nin this section. The activities can be done in any order.\n°\nClarifying leadership expectations\n°\nRenewing an emphasis on employee training and development\n°\nRecognizing, rewarding, and celebrating contribution\n°\nIdentifying and initiating high-priority improvements\n°\nRevitalizing the \"suggestion system\"\n°\nEvaluating and revising policies and practices to eliminate bureaucracy and empower\nemployees\n°\nEvaluating and improving the quality process\nCLARIFY LEADERSHIP EXPECTATIONS\n\"Sooner or later everybody's going to realize that the ship is leaving\nthe dock and you can either stay on the dock or you can\ngo with us on this voyage...but we're going\"\n-- Allen Schweim, Executive Director, STA\nEarly TQM efforts in the first phase (Foundation) generally rely on volunteers. In that first phase,\nleaders create opportunities for others in the organization to assert their leadership and to develop\nand improve in their practice of TQM. Despite these opportunities, however, many managers will\nremain on the sidelines. To get them off the sidelines and into the game, the senior leadership\nmust be clear and united in its expectations, and it must communicate those expectations to all of\nmanagement.\nBy this time, the expectations should not be a surprise. They should echo the common values and\npromote the envisioned future role of managers in the organization. Ideally, they would also\nreflect the behavior practiced by the senior leaders themselves. Typical expectations might be:\n\n°\nListening to front-line employees and working with them to implement improvements\n°\nParticipating in quality initiatives\n°\nImproving communication and cooperation across departments and functions\n°\nAttending to rather than ignoring \"people\" issues\nBy clarifying leadership expectations and issuing the leadership challenge, senior leaders can\nnow push harder with momentum-building activities. They can more easily develop and\nencourage those that are up to the challenge and begin to ask tough questions of those who lag\nbehind. This is a great opportunity for senior leaders to coach those who lag and to make a\nsincere effort to bring them on board.\nEXAMPLE\nManagement norms at SORTA\nMetro has developed management norms and principles that can act as a code of conduct for\nmanagement employees. Using the principle of employee involvement, nearly 100 management\nemployees participated in creating the management norms, thereby establishing ownership and\npeer pressure to adhere to the desired management behaviors. In this way, progressive\nmanagement practice can be more easily reward and reinforced, and coaching can be brought to\nbear on management employees who are not behaving in accordance with the new environment.\nRESOURCES\n°\nBlanchard, K., Carew, D., and Parisi-Carew, E., The One-Minute Manager: Builds High\nPerformance Teams, 1990.\n°\nByham, W.C., Cox, J., Zapp!

That should come\nas no surprise. Despite lip service about people-as-our-most-important-asset,\nwe value hardware assets over people, and have done so for the last century\"\n-- Tom Peters\n\"Empowerment\" is a key word in TQM. It means that every employee has the authority and\nability to solve customer problems and improve operations. But \"enablement\" must proceed\nempowerment, otherwise management simply abdicates responsibility under a new banner. As an\norganization moves forward with TQM, all the employees will need to learn new skills to be\nsuccessful. Most organizations have provided adequate new technical skills to their employees.\nWith TQM, employees will also need skills in coaching, problem solving, communication,\nproject management, and other areas. Without skilled employees, the TQM initiative will fail.\nTraining budgets simply must increase to support a workplace that depends more and more on\nthe collective brainpower and skill sets of all employees. Training employees in the following\nareas will support TQM:\n\n°\nQuality awareness -- This training is probably best delivered by members of the leadership\nteam in partnership with the immediate supervisor. Some professional facilitation may be\nhelpful. The training can take the form of briefing sessions and less structured dialogues.\nNormally, these sessions introduce quality principles, the organization's TQM goals, and its\naction plan. In addition, sponsor employee visits to organizations known for leadership and\nquality, or invite knowledgeable practitioners to discuss their journey with your group. Use\nthis vehicle for leadership team education.\n°\nEmployee orientation -- New employees should have quality awareness training in their first\nweek on the job. Consider assigning the new employee to a mentor known for their leadership\nability for at least their first month.\n°\nCoaching skills training -- In TQM, the roles of managers and supervisors are very different\nfrom those in a traditional organization. It's important to create a training curriculum mapped\nto these new expectations. Role playing can help managers and supervisors learn some of the\n\"soft\" skills and the tools used for employee development, soliciting and implementing\nemployee suggestions, and managing across departments.\n°\nQuality Improvement Team training -- This equips teams and/or team leaders with basic\nproblem-solving, group-dynamic, and meeting management tools. If you use QIT sponsors,\nsuch as senior leadership team members, this training should explain their role and functions.\n°\nQuality facilitators -- Employees who demonstrate leadership capabilities can apprentice\nwith more seasoned quality facilitators to learn new skills.\n°\nAdvanced quality training -- Developing personal, group, and organizational expertise in\nmore advanced quality applications, e.g., in reengineering processes, in creating self-\nmanaging teams, and in revamping measurement systems. In addition to training, developing\nthis expertise often requires consulting support.\n°\nProfessional development plans -- Employees who want to advance in the organization\nshould have the opportunity to create professional development plans. These specify skill\ndevelopment, team assignments, and potential job rotations that will position the employee to\nachieve his or her professional goals. It's often helpful to use mentors to help employees\ndevelop and implement these plans. Furthermore, increase the use of planned rotational\nassignments.\nYou've probably heard of just-in-time inventory management. Apply the same\nconcept to training, and try to ensure that employees are trained just before they\nneed to use the skill at work. For example, provide training in problem-solving just\nas a QIT forms and before it begins to work.\nEXAMPLE\nPilot training effort at CTA focusing on customer interaction and culture\nchange\nThe CTA labor-management relations subcommittee began a pilot project to change the way\nmanagers interact with employees on customer complaints. The program offers an alternative\naction besides discipline for the first complaint. Employees will have the option to take an\ninteractive compact disk video training program focusing on customer interaction.\n\nRESOURCES -- Organizations offering TQM-related training include:\n°\nAmerican Management Association. 135 West 50th Street, New York, NY 10020, 518-891\n4048.\n°\nAmerican Productivity & Quality Center (APQC). 123 North Post Oak Lane, Suite 300,\nHouston, TX 77024, 713-681-4020.\n°\nAssociation for Quality and Participation (AQP). 801-B West 8th Street, Suite 501,\nCincinnati, OH 45203, 513-381-1959.\n°\nAmerican Society for Quality Control (ASQC). 310 West Wisconsin Avenue, Milwaukee,\nWI 53203, 414-272-8575.\n°\nQuality and Productivity Management Association (QPMA). 300 Martingale Road, Suite\n230, Schaumburg, IL 60173, 708-619-2909.\nRECOGNIZE, REWARD, & CELEBRATE CONTRIBUTION\n\"I am very proud to be a part of TQM...it has changed my life and\nhopefully it has changed a lot of other employee lives also\"\n-- Ruby Brockington, Safety & Training\nTechnician and Senior Driver, PDRTA\nRecognize, reward, and celebrate contributions and improvements publicly. To have the desired\nimpact, the leadership team should be personally and visibly involved. In the early stages of this\nphase, you'll be recognizing the results of the earliest improvement efforts. Those first volunteers\nwere willing to experiment, to stick their necks out, to risk ridicule from their peers. They put in\neffort above and beyond normal work duties -- these people are the champs! The leadership\nteam should acknowledge its special debt to these trailblazers. Go out of your way to recognize\ntheir special contributions.\nAs you move beyond the early improvement efforts on your quality journey, continue to use\nrecognition, reward, and celebration to sustain and reenergize your efforts. It's up to the\nleadership team to sponsor the creation of recognition processes, events, and programs of many\nvarieties. See the list below for inspiration:\n°\nTeam presentations - The team tells its story as well as presenting its results.\n°\nSharing rallies - Teams, individuals, and work groups come together to share their\naccomplishments and learn from each other.\n°\nPeer recognition - Supply everyone with blank \"Thank You\" cards. When someone is\nespecially helpful, anyone can give him or her a \"Thank You.\" Cards can be displayed in\ntheir vehicles, at their workspaces, or on their lockers.\n°\nQuality Day celebrations - Once a year, have a formal celebration that recognizes the great\nwork everyone has done and provides a forum for team stories of contribution.\n°\nStory-telling and folklore - Find opportunities to tell stories of individuals and teams that\nwent above and beyond the call of duty, took risks, delighted customers -- better yet, find\nways to let them tell their own stories!\n°\nPublications in Newsletters - Highlight the efforts and contributions of individuals and\nteams.\n°\nIncreased leadership opportunities - Provide opportunities for increased leadership\nresponsibility when individuals and teams have earned it.\n°\nCommendation bulletin boards - Create a bulletin board for customer commendations.\n°\nPins, totebags, coffee mugs - Give tokens of appreciation for participation in the quality\nprocess.\n\nRESOURCES\n°\nKnouse, S., The Reward and Recognition Process in Total Quality Management, 1995.\nIDENTIFY AND INITIATE HIGH-PRIORITY IMPROVEMENTS\n\"The recipe for action should consist of 90 percent substance\nand 10 percent exhortation, not the reverse\"\n-- Joseph Juran\nOnce an organization reaps the benefits of basic quality improvement methods such as QITs, it\nwill probably want to multiply the numbers of such efforts throughout the organization. This is a\nhealthy motive but, unfortunately, increasing the number of QITs will not guarantee increased\nsuccess. This is the time to establish a balance between a larger number of localized grassroots\nimprovement efforts -- and a short list of high-priority improvement initiatives selected by senior\nleadership. Improvement efforts with the highest priority should be those that provide the biggest\nbang for the buck in terms of customer satisfaction and are most clearly aligned with the\norganization's mission, vision, and strategic goals. See the example on page 26 of a planning\nmatrix to link customer satisfaction and performance measures to the selection of high-priority\ninitiatives.\nLeadership teams can use a variety of methods to identify and assign priorities to improvement\ninitiatives. One of the most formal is known as policy deployment (see the example of a policy\ndeployment process flow on page 26). This same method is sometimes called Hoshin Planning. It\nbegins with customer input and the vision and mission of the organization. Major improvement\ninitiatives are defined through a process known as \"catchball.\" Catchball describes the back-and\nforth communication required between senior leadership, operational managers, and project teams\n- such as QITs - to manage all aspects of planning and implementation for the improvement\ninitiatives. It's common for several QITs to be coordinated through a single policy deployment\nimprovement initiative. QIT leaders will meet regularly with a designated senior sponsor to\ncoordinate improvement efforts deployed through a major initiative.\nLess formal approaches to selecting high-priority improvement initiatives include simply\ndeveloping a short list of priorities that show a direct line of sight to key customer priorities or\nestablishing a \"Top 5 most wanted\" list at the company level or by modes or major divisions.\nOnce the objectives of an initiative have been accomplished, a new initiative takes its place on the\nTop 5 list.\nAnother quality method often used in conjunction with identifying and initiating high-priority\nimprovement initiatives is \"benchmarking.\" The basic concept behind benchmarking is to look at\nother organizations that have achieved high levels of performance in a particular area of interest,\ne.g., vehicle maintenance, in order to learn the practices and processes that help them succeed.\nYou may benchmark against other transit agencies or against companies outside the transit\nindustry that do something of interest particularly well, e.g., managing customer complaints.\nBenchmarking during the Momentum Phase is best applied on a project basis. Extensive across-\nthe-board benchmarking efforts are normally reserved for mature quality efforts.\n\nEXAMPLE\nA planning matrix links customer satisfaction ratings and performance\nmeasures to the selection of high-priority initiatives\nEXAMPLE\nPolicy deployment process flow\n\nRESOURCES\n°\nAT&T Quality Library, Policy Deployment Handbook, Select Code 500-453, 1992.\n°\nCamp, R.C., Benchmarking: The Search for Industry Best Practices that Lead to Superior\nPerformance, 1989.\n°\nKing, B., Hoshin Planning - The Developmental Approach, GOAL/QPC, 1988.\nREVITALIZE THE \"SUGGESTION SYSTEM\"\nThe suggestion system allows anyone with an idea for improvement to contribute. Most ideas will\nnot be home runs; however, the cumulative effect of many incremental improvements adds up to\nsignificant results and, most importantly, creates a culture that promotes continuous improvement\nby everyone as a way of life. In Japan, continuous improvement by all is known as \"kaizen.\"\nSuccessful suggestion systems provide a multitude of ways for an employee to suggest an idea or\nput it into action. When employee suggestions are valued, management is expected to listen and,\nwhen the suggestion is bigger than something the employee can implement him or herself, take\naction. Most American suggestion systems are failures primarily because they rely only on a\ncentralized bureaucratic suggestion box that removes the responsibility for implementing\nimprovements from local management. To revitalize your suggestion system, we recommend that\nsenior leadership plan for the following three stages:\n°\nInterest - Implement as many suggestions as possible and respond quickly to all of them. If a\nsuggestion cannot be implemented, say why.\n°\nEducation - Educate and coach employees to improve the quality of their suggestions.\n°\nImpact - Put more emphasis on suggestions with economic impact.\nYou won't revitalize your suggestion system if you skip the \"interest\" and \"education\" stages and\ngo directly to \"impact.\" In our experience, most suggestions with high economic impact come\nfrom a team rather than an individual. The economic impact of individual suggestions is generally\nbecause of the cumulative effect of many small improvements. Of course, implementing\nindividual suggestions also helps create the mindset and culture of continuous improvement, that\nis, kaizen.\nGo slowly when beginning to revitalize your suggestion system. Emphasize that the\nentire senior leadership team expects supervisors to solicit and act on all front-line\nemployee suggestions for improvements to service and operations. If you choose to\ncontinue with a centralized suggestion system, add visible senior leadership support.\nFor example, review the status of suggestions as a standing leadership team agenda item. Also,\nconsider piloting less formal local suggestion systems. Just be sure to pilot these with supervisors\nwho are eager to try new things and implement employee suggestions. Above all, before you\nintroduce any suggestions system, prepare the way so that the system can deliver on its promises.\nRESOURCES\n°\nImai, M., Kaizen: The Key to Japan's Competitive Success, 1986.\n\nEVALUATE & REVISE POLICIES & PRACTICES TO ELIMINATE\nBUREAUCRACY & EMPOWER EMPLOYEES\n\"Getting people to step up and be owners of the system\nhas, hopefully, secured our future\"\n-- Bill Spraul, Division Director, SORTA\nTQM promotes the concept of a value-based organization in which people's work is guided by\ndirection, values, and accountability instead of by the rule book and elaborate staff procedures.\nFor most transit organizations -- indeed, for most organizations -- this is a huge and threatening\nchange. Although many of transit's \"rules\" are designed to promote public safety, many more are\nrooted in a long history of command-and-control management practice.\nWe recommend that the leadership team look for opportunities to revise policies and practices to\nremove barriers that prevent employees from delighting their customers. A few simple rule\nchanges can send a powerful signal that things are changing for the better. Examples include:\n°\nGiving every operator his or her own business card, which entitles a passenger to a free ride -\nThis can help the operator recover from service problems and may turn a potentially\ndissatisfied passenger into a loyal customer.\n°\nKeeping first-time customer complaints off the driver's service record - Give drivers the\noption to receive training that may help them in dealing with difficult passenger situations.\n°\nEliminating unnecessary approval processes.\nIf you can't seem to identify opportunities for revising policies and practices to eliminate\nbureaucracy and empower employees, get out there and discuss this with front-line employees.\nFacilitated employee focus groups are another effective means to get at some of these issues.\nSurvey employees periodically to track employee satisfaction and their\nperceptions of the organization's progress. Make sure the survey is anonymous,\nand report the results widely within the organization. An example is provided on\npage 31.\nEVALUATE AND IMPROVE THE QUALITY PROCESS\nAs you do for any other aspect of your organization, you should evaluate the TQM process itself\nand improve it on a regular basis. Normally, the evaluation should be done once a year.\nCoordinate it with other significant planning functions, e.g., the annual budgeting process. Major\nsteps to evaluate your quality process include:\n°\nDetermining the areas for the evaluation and assessment method\n°\nConducting the quality assessment\n°\nIdentifying quality process improvement opportunities\n\nEarly in your journey, i.e., during the Foundation Phase, it may be more appropriate to use fairly\nelementary areas of evaluation. After the quality process has established sufficient momentum, it\nmay be more productive to do a more comprehensive and rigorous evaluation using, for example,\nthe Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award criteria.\nAssessment methods range from informal self-assessments to formal third-party audits based on\nextensive documentation and review. Generally speaking, it's best to use an objective auditor or\naudit team skilled and experienced in both the use of quality assessments and the transit industry.\nEmployee focus groups are often helpful for gaining insight into the effectiveness of various\nTQM initiatives and the overall cultural impact of the TQM process.\nEXAMPLE\nElementary evaluation areas for a quality process\n1.

      "content": "CHAPTER 4\nFARE STRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT AND EVALUATION\nPROCESS AND EFFECTS\nINTRODUCTION\nThus far, this report has described the general approach to\nmaking fare-related decisions in the transit industry. Chapter 2\nreviewed the development of fare policy and the overall fare\ndecision-making process, while Chapter 3 discussed the range\nof fare strategies and payment options, as well as the general\nprocess for evaluating alternative strategies. This chapter\nexamines the specific methodologies that various transit\nagencies use to develop and evaluate fare structure\nmodifications. This chapter also assesses the effects of the\nresulting fare decisions on ridership and revenue. The\ninformation presented here is based on the findings of the case\nstudies carried out as part of the project. (Although this\nchapter focuses on the fare structure aspects of the case\nstudies, some of the case studies also looked at the selection\nand procurement of new fare collection technologies and\nequipment; these findings are discussed in Chapter 8. The case\nstudies themselves are presented in a separate document.)\nTHE CASE STUDY PROCESS\nSelection of Case Study Sites\nTo develop an understanding of the issues and methods used\nby transit agencies of different sizes and modal orientations in\nmaking fare-related decisions, the project team conducted\ndetailed case studies of 12 U.S. transit agencies. Candidate\nagencies were identified on the basis of the background\nresearch conducted in the initial phase of the project. The\nselection focused on agencies that were known either to have\ndone significant fare restructuring or implemented innovative\nfare structures or to have implemented--or be planning to\nacquire--electronic fare collection systems, media distribution\nsystems, or both. In addition to the 12 case study sites, the\nteam identified a set of \"backup\" sites--for use if the\ninformation available from any of the original sites was\ninsufficient. The case study sites were presented to the Project\nA-1 Panel for approval, following consideration of 60\npotential sites.\nTable 26 lists the case study sites and backups, grouped by\nsize (monthly ridership). The distribution of case studies was\nas follows:\n- Largest systems--3 (CTA, MBTA, and NJT)\n- Very large systems--1 (Seattle/King County Metro)\n- Large systems--3 (BSDA, DART, and OCTA)\n- Medium systems--1 (TARC)\n- Small systems--2 (MVRTA, Madison Metro)\n- Very small systems--1 (GLPTC)\n- Commuter rail systems--1 (SCRRA)\nThe Case Study Agencies\nThe case studies focused on two key issues: fare\ncollection/distribution technology and fare policy/structure. In\nsix of the cases (CTA, MBTA, NJT, Seattle Metro, MVRTA,\nand SCRRA), the researchers considered technological\nimprovements--along with structural changes. These systems\nhave or are procuring new equipment. MVRTA has magnetic\ncard readers, CTA and MBTA are in the electronic fare\ncollection equipment procurement process, NJT is procuring\nticket vending machines (TVMs), and SCRRA, a new system,\nrecently acquired its automated vending machines (AVMs).\nThe findings related to selection of technology are presented\nin Chapter 8. In the other six case studies, the researchers\nfocused on structural changes only. In each of these cases--\nand in several of the former--a significant structural change\nhas been introduced recently (i.e., within the last couple of\nyears). This list of cases represents a broad range of fare\nstructures. Information on the basic fare structures, along with\nother general information, is presented in Table 27. The key\nfare-related aspects of each case are summarized as follows:\n- CTA (Chicago)--CTA undertook major fare structure\nevaluations in 1986 and 1989 and implemented a market-\nbased restructuring in 1990, with several changes in fare\nlevels and types and prices of passes since then. CTA is\nprocuring electronic fare collection equipment.\n- MBTA (Boston)--MBTA plans to procure a new\nelectronic fare collection system; it has a zonal system\nwith a service-based differential (higher fare on rail than\non bus).\n- NJT (New Jersey)--NJT operates a statewide bus, LRT,\nand commuter rail system and has a complicated zonal\nfare structure; this structure was recently simplified\nconsiderably. NJT has used innovative fare research and\nevaluation procedures. In addition, NJT has installed\nelectronic registering fareboxes and is acquiring AVMs.\n- Seattle/King County Metro--Seattle Metro recently\ninstalled electronic registering fareboxes and considered\nthe purchase of bus ticket processing units; this will\nfacilitate the use of post payment for employer-subsidized\npasses. Seattle Metro also sells monthly passes through\nATMs. Finally, Metro--along with the other operators--\nis studying regional fare integration options.\n\nTABLE 26 Case studies and backups\n- BSDA (St. Louis)--BSDA recently opened a light rail\nline; the fare structure was revamped (simplified) in\nconjunction with the introduction of LRT, although the\nstructure remains complicated because of its unique two-\nstate and multiple jurisdiction service and funding\narrangement--each jurisdiction can set its own fares.\n- DART (Dallas)--DART has instituted two unusual fare\nrestructurings: 1) reducing the cash fare and 2) raising it\nto its previous level but subsequently eliminating the\nzonal structure. DART recently developed a new\nstructure, using innovative research methods; it will be\nimplementing LRT and commuter rail in the next 2 years\nand is procuring AVMs.\n- OCTA (Orange County, California) -- OCTA has\nchanged various aspects of its fare structure every 1 to 2\nyears; these changes have included eliminating, and\n\nTABLE 27 Case study properties--overview\n* Peak/off-peak on bus only\n+ Rail/bus cash fares (MBTA, NJT)\n** LRT to open in 1996\nAnnual Passengers = unlinked trips (1992 Section 15 data)\nsubsequently\nreintroducing,\ndiscounted\ntickets;\nintroducing and then eliminating a peak/off-peak\ndifferential; introducing and then eliminating an express\nsurcharge; and several changes to its transfer policy and\npricing.\n- TARC (Louisville, Kentucky)--TARC recently (1993)\nimplemented a deep discount plan. TARC had not\nchanged fares since 1980.\n- MVRTA (Dayton, Ohio)--MVRTA is one of the\nsmallest--and was one of the first--systems to install\nmagnetic card readers on its buses; MVRTA instituted a\ndeep discount fare structure in 1993, the first fare change\nsince 1982.\n- Madison Metro (Madison, Wisconsin)--Madison Metro\nimplemented a deep discount plan in 1991 and has\nexperienced considerable success in terms of the effect on\nridership and revenue.\n- GLPTC (Lafayette, Indiana)--GLPTC implemented a\ndeep discount plan as a promotion and then made it\npermanent because of its strong support from riders.\n- SCRRA Metrolink (Southern California)--SCRRA, a\nrelatively new system, has already adjusted its distance-\nbased fare structure to increase ridership; it is considering\nsome further restructuring. The agency has AVMs that\naccept credit and debit cards.\nThe case study agencies have different types of fare\nstructures. The key fare structure elements, summarized in\nTables 28 and 29, are as follows:\n- Fare differentiation by distance, time-of-day, type of\nservice, or combinations thereof; as shown in Table 28,\nfour of the agencies have some type of zonal or distance-\nbased structure, four have a peak/off-peak differential,\nand four have an express surcharge or bus/rail\ndifferential. Four of the agencies have none of these types\nof fare differential.\n- Transfer pricing--as shown in Table 28, two of the\nagencies have no intramodal discounted transfer charge\n(actually, MBTA does offer free intrastation transfers on\nits rapid rail lines), two charge $0.10, and the others offer\nfree intramodal transfers. Only SCRRA offers free\nintermodal\ntransfers\n(depending\non\nthe\nspecific\nagreements with the bus operators with which it\nintersects).\n- Prepaid options--as shown in Table 29, all of the\nagencies offer a monthly pass, with breakeven levels\nranging from 24 to 59 trips per month; only two of the\nagencies provide weekly passes (none offers biweekly\npasses); all but two (MBTA and Seattle Metro) offer\ndiscounted multi-ride tickets or tokens (These agencies\neach recently eliminated bulk purchase discounts; this is\ndiscussed later in this chapter).\n\nTable 28 indicates that all of the case study agencies have\nmade fare changes within the last several years. Over two-\nthirds of the agencies have made changes since January 1993,\nand one of the others (NJT) may revise its fare structure soon.\nOnly GLPTC, the smallest of the case study agencies, has now\ngone longer than 5 years without modifying its fares.\nThese case studies provide interesting insights into the\ndifferent approaches transit agencies take in developing and\napplying fare policies and in making decisions regarding fare\nchanges in both the structural and technological areas. The\ncase studies have also provided an opportunity to assess the\ntrue effect of fare changes on transit use.\nThe Case Study Process\nThe general approach to collecting and analyzing data was\nas follows:\n- A letter introducing the project and the case study\nanalysis framework was sent to a contact person at each\nof the selected agencies. In some cases, this was the\nGeneral Manager, in others, the head of planning, revenue\ncollection, finance, or some other relevant department.\nTABLE 28 Case study current fare structures\n- A follow-up call was made to elicit 1) a commitment to\nparticipate and 2) the name of the contact person (if\ndifferent from the initial contact).\n- Information\nwas\nrequested,\nand,\nwhere\ndeemed\nappropriate by the researcher, a site visit was arranged.\nFollow-up calls were made, where necessary, to request\nadditional data or, in several cases, to reiterate the request\nfor initial data.\n- Data were reviewed and analyzed, and additional data\nwere requested, if necessary.\n- The draft case study was written up and submitted to the\nagency contact person for review. Case studies were then\nrevised as needed.\nThe individual case studies describe the experiences of each\nof these agencies in their efforts to develop fare policies and\nevaluate potential improvements, as well as the effects of the\nfare changes they have made and (where appropriate) their\nequipment procurement processes. These reviews are\npresented in a separate report, Fare Policies, Structures, and\nTechnologies: Case Studies. The rest of Chapter 4, along with\nChapter 8, summarizes and analyzes the case study findings.\n*\nCTA: peak/off-peak on bus only\n**\nNJT has complex zone structure. The local bus fare for a 10-mile trip is $1.90; the local rail fare for a 10-mile trip is $1.95.\n***\nNJT charges an incremental zonal fee for rail feeder trips.\n+\nOCTA has various transfer agreements connecting operators.\n++\nSCRAA: maximum one-way fare is $9.50 (7 zones); SCRAA has transfer agreements with connecting operators.\n\nTABLE 29 Case study prepaid fare options\n*\nMonthly pass price shown is for peak period; range represents multiple zones.\n**\nBreakeven rate is based on full (single-ride) peak cash fares.\nFARE STRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS\nAs corroborated in the case studies, the process for\ndeveloping fare policy and making changes to the fare\nstructure varies widely from one transit agency to the next. It\nwas found, in conducting the case studies, that differences\noccur in the following key aspects of the fare policy and\nstructure development process:\n- The frequency of and impetus for fare evaluations and\nchanges and\n- The nature of the evaluation and fare change\nmethodologies.\nThese are discussed in the following sections.\nFrequency of and Impetus for Fare Evaluations and\nChanges\nThe frequency of fare changes at the case study agencies is\nshown in Table 30, along with the nature of the most recent\nchange, the impetus for this change, and the nature of the fare\nchange process. As indicated, the frequency is not necessarily\nrelated to the reasons for change. It does appear to be linked to\nthe size of the agency, though--none of the smaller case study\nagencies conducts frequent reviews, while most of the larger\nones do. Five agencies have implemented some type of fare\nmodification every 1 to 3 years (at least over the past 15\nyears). These are typically not major restructuring; in some\ncases, only one fare element may be modified (e.g., the\nmonthly pass price is raised, or the base cash fare is raised\nwhile everything else remains the same). The nature of the\nchanges is discussed below. Nevertheless, these agencies are\nat least reviewing the fare structure or levels frequently.\nIn considering this issue, it is important to distinguish\nbetween agencies that have an official policy or requirement to\nreview fares regularly versus those that conduct reviews or\nmake changes as needed. For instance, CTA has instituted\nsome type of modification every year or two of late; however,\nthe more recent of these changes have involved adjustments to\nmonthly pass prices only. These changes have been made to\naddress a particular problem--inadequate revenue--rather\nthan to address a policy calling for annual or biannual fare\nreviews. NJT and BSDA also have made frequent fare\nadjustments to address particular problems or needs. In\ncontrast, Seattle Metro has an official policy to conduct a fare\nreview every 2 years, and OCTA routinely reviews fares as\npart of its annual short-range planning process. The APTA\nAnnual Fare Summary reports that only 3 percent of its\nrespondents have formal regular fare review policies or\nrequirements; most North American agencies change fares as\nneeded.\nOnly 24 percent of the APTA respondents reported a\nrequired minimum fare recovery ratio, and only 15 percent\neven have a fare recovery goal. Only two of the case study\n\nTABLE 30 Case study fare change policies\n* TARC had monthly passes before 1993, but they were available only through certain employers.\nagencies--MBTA and OCTA--have required ratios; yet,\nMBTA has implemented only two fare changes since 1982\n(although a recent fare policy statement calls for more\nfrequent reviews). In three other cases (DART, TARC, and\nMVRTA), unacceptably low fare recovery ratios were cited as\nkey reasons for recent fare changes. Like MBTA, these\nagencies have made relatively infrequent fare adjustments;\nboth TARC and MVRTA changed fares in 1993, and this was\nthe first fare modification for each in over a decade. Both\nagencies benefit from a dedicated local funding source, which\nwas strong enough throughout the 1980s to obviate the need\nfor increased fare revenue.\nMost agencies review their fare structures only in response\nto a particular problem (e.g., declining revenue or ridership) or\nsome type of outside pressure (e.g., a public outcry). The\nproblems prompting an agency to undertake a fare review or\nmake a change are many and varied. The major reasons for\ncase study agencies to review or change fares are summarized\nin Table 30. An unacceptable fare recovery ratio is one\nimpetus; others are described in the following paragraphs.\nNeed for Additional Revenue\nThe need for additional revenue was the single most\nfrequently cited impetus for pursuing a fare increase among\nthe case study agencies. In six cases (CTA, MBTA, Seattle\nMetro, TARC, MVRTA, and Madison Metro), it was a major\nreason for a fare change. This is also an essential element of\nimproving the fare recovery ratio, which also was cited as a\nmajor reason for considering a fare change (by four of the\nagencies). Increasing revenues through fare increases can be\nthought of as the demand side approach to improving the fare\nrecovery ratio. It may be, for instance, that operating costs\nhave not risen, but that other sources of revenue (e.g.,\ndedicated tax receipts or state and federal subsidies) have\ndeclined. At both TARC and MVRTA, for instance, dedicated\nlocal tax receipts fell somewhat during the recession of the last\nfew years, leading the agencies to consider fare increases for\nthe first time in more than a decade.\nA related reason for wanting to increase fare levels is to\nmaintain pace with inflation. As inflation increases input\nprices for the agency, operating costs rise. To ensure that\nthe fare recovery ratio remains steady over time, fare\nrevenues will need to increase; therefore, a reasonable goal\nis to maintain a steady ratio of operating revenues to costs,\nwhile not inflicting a \"real\" fare increase on passengers.\nInterestingly, although this may be an easy way to market\nthe fare increase to riders, not one of the case study\nagencies takes such an approach, and it is apparently quite\nrare in the United States, on the basis of the APTA\nfindings. This type of policy is more frequently\n\nused in the more heavily transit-oriented cities of Europe. For\nexample, both London Transport and British Rail employ such\na strategy, increasing prices on a yearly basis but not altering\nthe fare structure with every price increase.\nDeclining Ridership\nBecause U.S. transit agencies depend heavily on the\nsubsidies provided by political bodies, there is a strong\nincentive to develop and maintain high ridership levels.\nPolitical acceptability will depend on both the absolute level\nof ridership and the equity effect of providing services to\ndifferent groups and in different geographical areas. Thus, if\ntotal transit trip-making is low, or a small (or decreasing)\nproportion of the total trips are made in the service area, then\nthe political acceptability of large subsidies for transit may\nwane.\nDART, OCTA, BSDA, and SCRRA cited ridership levels as\ncompelling reasons for considering fare revisions. DART was\nmotivated by falling ridership levels to institute major fare\nrestructuring in both 1984 and 1990. In the former instance,\nthe agency reduced the cash fare from $0.70 to $0.50, while in\nthe latter case, it eliminated the zone structure. An interim fare\nchange in 1987 saw the fare raised to $0.75 in order to boost\nrevenue. OCTA was spurred largely by declining ridership to\nconduct a major fare structure review in 1993, although the\nagency also was very concerned about maintaining revenue.\nBSDA had been experiencing steady ridership loss over the\npast several years when it decided to simplify the fare\nstructure and to reduce some fare levels (the express surcharge\nwas eliminated and the transfer charge was reduced). Finally,\nSCRRA reduced some of its fares in order to increase\nridership, although the commuter rail system experienced a\nshort-term jump in demand following the earthquake in early\n1994. A new agency, SCRRA is fine-tuning its fare structure.\nFare Structure Complexity\nAnother impetus to considering modifications to a fare\nstructure has been the concern that the agency's fare structure\nis overly complicated or contains unnecessary inconsistencies.\nThis is tied to the goal of increasing simplicity from the rider's\npoint of view--thereby increasing ridership--and reducing the\nadministrative and operational burden caused by a complex\nfare structure.\nSimplification was an important concern for BSDA in\ncarrying out its 1993 fare study. The fare structure in the St.\nLouis area is complicated by the transit provider's unique\ninstitutional\nstructure:\nthe\ntwo\nparticipating\nIllinois\njurisdictions (St. Clair and Madison counties) are each free to\nset their own fare levels for the service BSDA provides for\nthem, and these fares often have differed somewhat from the\nfares BSDA sets for its Missouri service. The BSDA fare\nstructure was complicated further by several fare differentials\nand upgrade transfer charges (for express and premium\nservice), as well as a broad--and overlapping--set of prepaid\npasses (monthly and weekly, for each type of service) and\ndiscount tickets. Although BSDA was able to consolidate\nsome of the fare options (e.g., through elimination of the\nexpress and premium differentials and passes), it was not able\nto convince the Illinois counties to accept a uniform fare\nstructure.\nAt NJT, the complexity of the statewide zonal structure--as\nwell as some inconsistencies in fare levels for essentially\nsimilar trips--has prompted an ongoing review of fares. The\nmultimodal nature of the service, the very different types of\nmarkets served by the different modes, and the different types\nof markets in different parts of the state have combined to\nfoster this complexity and inhibit reasonable adjustments.\nThus, although NJT has reduced the number of zones and\nrectified some of the most glaring inconsistencies, the fare\nstructure remains complex.\nSimplification has also represented an important goal in fare\nrestructuring at DART and OCTA. DART eliminated its zonal\nstructure in 1990. OCTA has removed its peak/off-peak\ndifferential, its express surcharge, and finally its transfer\ncharge (i.e., transfers are free) over the years. Seattle Metro\nstrongly considered eliminating its zonal structure as well as\nits peak/off-peak differential in 1992 but decided to keep these\nstrategies, because it was predicted that ridership would be\nlower without them. Of course, Metro had already greatly\nsimplified its structure when it reduced the number of zones\nfrom 38 to 2 in 1977.\nApparently, these concerns over simplicity are shared by\nmuch of the U.S. transit industry--slightly more than a third\nof the APTA Fare Summary respondents have distance-based\nor zonal fares (similar to the percentage of the case studies);\nonly 6 percent have peak/off-peak differentials (33 percent in\nthe case studies). Many agencies assess the potential for these\ntypes of fare differentiation when considering new fare\nstructure changes, but most decide that the administrative and\noperational\nissues\nassociated\nwith\nintroducing\nand\nadministering them outweigh any potential revenue or\nridership advantages. The results of such evaluations\nconducted by the case study agencies are reviewed below.\nIntroduction of a New Mode\nThe introduction of a new type of service (e.g., a light rail or\ncommuter rail line) typically triggers a review of the agency's\nfare structure; this represents the service-driven scenario\ndescribed in Chapter 2. The motivating factor is the desire to\nintegrate the new mode into the current system effectively, and\nconsiderations generally include 1) the need to select a fare\nlevel for the new mode, relative to that of the existing modes;\nand 2) the need to reevaluate the transfer policy--with the\nintroduction of rail it is likely, for example, that much of the\nbus service has been redesigned to feed the new rail line and,\nhence, transfer patterns will have changed. Developing an\nappropriate integrated fare structure may be complicated by\nthe fact that the new mode may have a different fare collection\nsystem from the existing service (i.e., POP versus on-board).\nBSDA's 1993 fare change was timed to coincide with the\nopening of light rail, and the key decisions were to set the LRT\n\nfare equal to the local bus fare ($1) and to simplify the transfer\npolicy and reduce the transfer fee (from $0.20 to $0.10). A\nsmall transfer fee was retained because of the POP system on\nLRT and the belief that even such a small fee would reduce\nthe resale of unused transfer tickets.\nAt DART, the impending introduction of commuter rail and\nlight rail (over the next 2 years) was a key reason for the most\nrecent fare study (completed in July 1994). In this case, a\ntechnology-related decision regarding the POP system affected\nthe development of the new fare structure significantly.\nBecause DART initially decided not to purchase ticket\nvalidators with its new TVMs, the use of discounted multi-ride\ntickets was not considered practical on the rail lines. Thus,\nDART plans to discontinue its current multi-ride ticket once\nthe light rail line opens, at which time the tickets will be\nphased out and weekly passes may be offered instead. DART\nalso plans to charge the same fare ($1.00 at present) on LRT\nand local bus when the new line opens.\nIntroduction of New Fare Collection Technology\nThe direct impetus, in some instances, for evaluating the\nfare structure is the acquisition of some type of electronic fare\ncollection technology (i.e., the technology-driven scenario).\nBecause this technology facilitates use of a broad range of new\nfare options, an agency generally reviews the fare payment\nalternatives when it introduces electronic fare collection. In\nsuch cases, the new fare structure may involve no fare level\nchanges (e.g., the base fare for a single ride may be kept at its\nexisting level) but changes in the types and pricing of prepaid\nfare media. In New York, for example, NYMTA evaluated\nfare structure alternatives for its new electronic fare collection\nsystem and the stored value MetroCard. Various prepayment\noptions and discounts have been explored to provide greater\nconvenience to the riders, increase ridership, and reduce cash\nhandling costs.\nAmong the case study agencies, CTA has undertaken a\nsimilar fare structure review to evaluate options for its\nforthcoming electronic fare collection system and stored value\ncard. Seattle Metro has plans for a post payment/employer\nbilling mechanism, although its implementation depends on\nthe agency's ultimate decision whether to install bus ticket\nvalidators; in addition, Seattle Metro, along with other\noperators in the region, has begun planning a regional fare\nintegration project--using a common medium (a pass) and\nfare collection technology. OCTA, in its recently completed\nfare study, examined the potential for eliminating transfers--\nprobably in conjunction with implementation of a 1-day pass\nissued on the buses. The agency decided, however, that it\nprobably would not pursue this strategy unless it had bus\nticket validators. Finally, in contrast to the greater flexibility\noffered by electronic fare collection, DART's new fare\nstructure has been influenced by the constraints of having\nAVMs without ticket validators. (Issues associated with\nselection and procurement of new technology are discussed in\nChapter 8.)\nInterest in Innovative Fare and Marketing Strategies\nBecause of concern over maintaining or increasing\nridership, some agencies have restructured fares primarily to\ntake advantage of the marketing potential of innovative\npricing strategies. A deep discounting strategy--and an\nemphasis on prepayment in general--has often served as the\nfocus for such activities. Market-based fare strategies have\nbeen implemented in an effort to target different ridership\nmarkets and to reduce cash handling through greater sale of\nprepaid media. Among the case study agencies, CTA,\nBSDA, TARC, MVRTA, and Madison Metro all undertook\nfare restructuring focused on market-based or deep\ndiscounting strategies in recent years.\nA somewhat different marketing approach was shown in\nMBTA's decision not to increase fares through most of the\n1980s. The agency adopted this approach to reflect its\nacknowledgment that there were significant disruptions to\nservice and that service quality was generally low during the\nreconstruction and extension of the rail lines. Fare levels were\npreserved in an attempt to maintain ridership during\nconstruction. MBTA decision makers were concerned that,\nonce lost, riders would be difficult to regain (because of\nchanges in location of employment and residence and because\nof new behavior patterns).\nThere is no single motivation for review and modification of\nfare policies or structures. In the case studies, the most\nfrequently cited reason for reviewing fares was the need for\nadditional revenue; however, the desire to reverse declining\nridership trends was an important impetus. Other reasons\nincluded simplification and introduction of market-based\nstrategies.\nThe types of methodologies employed by the case study\nagencies in evaluating fare alternatives and developing\nrecommended modifications are discussed in the next section.\nEvaluation and Fare Change Methodologies\nChapter 2 presented an outline of a generic decision-making\nstructure through which fare policies, structures, and\ntechnologies can be developed or identified. This process\nincluded all steps--from the definition of policy goals to the\ndevelopment of the final fare system. The process identified\nwas not necessarily followed by all agencies at all times; the\ncombination and order of steps depended on the nature of the\ndecision to be made, the existing fare structure and\ntechnology, and the nature of the agency's general decision-\nmaking framework.\nThe case studies permit consideration of the procedures\nactually followed at different agencies and at different stages\nof fare decision making. Each case study discusses the fare\ndevelopment process in general, and, in most cases,\ndocuments the specific activities and methodologies\nfollowed in specific fare reviews. Several of these agencies'\n(CTA, OCTA, DART, and Seattle Metro) evaluation\nprocesses are outlined below, to show the types of\nmethodologies used.\n\nChicago Transit Authority\nCTA has performed two major fare structure studies in the\nlast 7 years. The first, in 1987, evaluated the following types\nof fare strategies:\n- Distance-based pricing,\n- Peak/off-peak differential,\n- Bus/rail differential, and\n- Maximum prepayment.\nThe steps included in this study, which laid the groundwork\nfor the subsequent study, were as follows:\n- Identify Fare Policy Goals--Goals were identified and\n\"strategic trade-offs\" between specific goals were\nestablished through discussions with staff from various\ndepartments and selected Board members.\n- Develop Evaluation Framework--Ten criteria were\nidentified, and evaluation guidelines were defined for\neach criterion. Where possible, specific quantitative\nguidelines were provided. The criteria and guidelines are\nsummarized in Table 31, along with the relative weights\nassigned each criterion; the criteria weights were based\non interviews with CTA Board members. As shown in\nTable 31, ridership, revenue, and costs were considered\nthe most important, while the provision of management\ninformation was ranked lowest.\n- Define and Analyze CTA's Markets--Considerable effort\nwas devoted to defining and analyzing the potential\nmarkets for CTA service. Elasticities were developed on\nthe basis of the results of a series of \"stated preference\"\nsurveys of riders and non-riders and were used to predict\nthe effect of different fare options on ridership.\n- Develop and Estimate Costs for Fare Options--Six\ndifferent options were developed and evaluated in\nisolation--in order to understand the implications of\neach--even though it was acknowledged that actual fare\nstructures might include a combination of strategies. The\noptions included peak/off-peak differentials, distance-\nbased pricing (zonal for rail only or systemwide, and rail\npoint to point), modal differentials, and maximization of\nprepayment. Potential costs (capital and operating) were\ncalculated for each option. The distance-based options\nwere found to cost the most, largely because a new fare\ntechnology probably would be needed to implement such\na strategy effectively.\n- Evaluate Options--Each option was evaluated on a\ncomparative basis according to each of the weighted\ncriteria.\nTABLE 31 Evaluation criteria and guidelines--CTA\n\nThe distance-based options received the lowest scores and\nwere deemed not worth pursuing; the remaining options\nwere recommended for further consideration. The overall\nconclusion regarding distance-based options was that\n\"The high capital costs of the fare equipment necessary\nfor distance-based charging could not be justified by\nadditional revenue raised, as this method was no more\nefficient at raising revenue than the present flat fare\nsystem.\"\nIn the second study (1989 through 1990), which led to the\nintroduction of a peak/off-peak structure and substantial\nprepayment discounts, the options for consideration were\nlimited to those rated highly in the previous study. These were\nas follows:\n- Peak/off-peak fare differential,\n- Bus/rail fare differential,\n- Premium for paying cash,\n- Deep discounting of fare prepayment mechanisms, and\n- Market segmented passes.\nThis effort involved the following steps:\n- Conduct Research on Innovative Fare Structures\nElsewhere--Information was compiled on other agencies'\nexperiences with market-based fare structures.\n- Conduct Market Analysis of Choice of Payment\nMethods--A rider survey was conducted on current use\npatterns and current and potential payment methods. The\nstated preference findings were used to predict shares of\nnew payment methods.\n- Develop a Revenue and Ridership Model--The revenue\nand ridership model developed for CTA incorporated the\npayment method shares model and a set of submarket\nelasticities (on the basis of previous CTA experience and\nindustry experience).\n- Evaluate Alternatives and Recommend a Revised Fare\nStructure--The study team developed five alternative\npricing strategies and then developed a range of specific\nfare structures within each strategy. This task included\nidentifying goals, implementation and operational issues,\nand evaluation criteria as well as the evaluation itself.\nThe actual evaluation was conducted in two steps. First,\nthe basic fare strategies were ranked according to the\ncriteria; this ranking was done through discussions among\nmembers of the Fare Policy Task Force. Second,\nridership and revenue projections were reviewed, and a\ngeneral type of fare structure that satisfied CTA's goal of\nmeeting a revenue target without losing ridership was\nselected; this option was selected at a consensus-building\nmeeting of the Task Force. Six specific fare structure\noptions were then developed on the basis of the selected\ngeneral structure.\n- Implement and Market New Fare Structure--The options\nwere presented to the Board of Directors and then at a\nseries of public hearings. The recommended structure\nwas approved in February 1990 and implemented less\nthan 3 months later.\n- Evaluate the Fare Structure Effects--After the new fares\nwere introduced, an evaluation was carried out.\nOrange County Transportation Agency\nAlthough OCTA has typically reviewed its fare levels every\nyear or two, the agency has completed two major fare studies\nsince 1980. The first of these, carried out during 1981 and\n1982, evaluated alternative strategies (distance-based/zonal\npricing, peak/off-peak differential, and flat fares) and\ndeveloped recommendations for a new structure and long-term\npolicy goals. The basic steps in this effort were as follows:\nIdentify Evaluation Criteria--The criteria included ridership\nand pricing efficiency (i.e., the extent to which the fare\ncharged was related to the cost of providing the service),\nrevenue\neffects,\nequity,\nuser\ncomprehension,\ndriver\nrequirements, accounting procedures, potential for fare abuse,\ncost of fare collection, and the likely political and public\nresponse.\n- Develop\nAlternatives--The\nalternatives\nconsidered,\nbesides the basic strategies (flat fare, retain the existing\npeak/off-peak differential, or introduce a zonal structure),\nincluded eliminating passes or a lower discount,\neliminating multi-ride tickets, and introducing transfers.\nEach alternative included specific fare levels. Separate\nsets of alternatives were identified for local and express\nservice.\n- Identify Elasticities--These were determined from\nindustry experience and by market segment (time and\npurpose).\n- Evaluate Alternatives--The alternatives were evaluated\nusing the above criteria. The resulting recommendations\nincluded 1) retain the peak/off-peak differential, 2) increase\nmonthly pass prices and eliminate ticket discounts, 3)\nimplement a zonal structure for express service only, and 4)\nover the long term, adopt a farebox recovery target and\nintroduce frequent incremental fare increases (i.e., triggered\nby the need to increase revenues).\nOCTA (then called OCTD) adopted some of these\nrecommendations (retain peak/off-peak, increase pass prices)\nbut rejected others (ticket discount was retained, flat fare for\nexpress was retained); the recovery farebox target was not\nadopted, although the agency has instituted frequent fare\nchanges.\nIn 1993 and 1994, a second major study was conducted to\nreview the existing fare structure and policy and develop\nrecommendations for changes. This study included the\nfollowing tasks:\n- Conduct Peer Group Analysis--The study team reviewed\nthe fare structures and fare elasticities used by 18 peer\nagencies.\n- Develop Fare Elasticities by Market Segment--This was\ndone on the basis of an analysis of OCTA ridership data,\ncoupled with the elasticity figures used by the peers--\nparticularly the other California agencies.\n- Review Current Transfer Policy--OCTA has a very high\nrate of transfers and is concerned about the extent of\ntransfer abuse and operator and rider confrontations\nregarding transfer validity. Thus, a key aspect of the study\nwas to examine a range of alternative transfer policies.\nOne possible approach considered was the elimination of\n\ntransfers in conjunction with introduction of a 1-day pass\nsold on the buses.\n- Develop a Fare Change Model--A submarket elasticity\napproach was combined with a disaggregate disutility\nmodel.\n- Review Current Fare Structure--The study team assessed\nthe extent to which the existing fare structure was\naddressing the fare policy goals.\n- Establish Evaluation Criteria--A set of evaluation criteria\nwas developed on the basis of the agency's stated fare\npolicy goals, and relative weights were assigned by\nmembers of the Fare Policy Task Force. The departments\nrepresented on the task force included grants and revenue,\ntransit planning, transportation, facility maintenance,\naccounting, and marketing.\n- Establish\nEvaluation\nMethodology--The\nevaluation\ncriteria fell into two categories: quantitative (those\npertaining to ridership and revenue) and qualitative (the\nremainder). The ridership and revenue criteria could be\napplied objectively, on the basis of projections from the\nFare Change Model (i.e., percentage increase or decrease\nfrom the base case). The qualitative criteria, on the other\nhand, had to be applied more subjectively, because their\neffects are not easily measured. To facilitate this process,\na set of guidelines to support the evaluation measures for\neach criterion was developed; these guidelines are shown\nin Table 32. The format for evaluating the alternatives\nwas a matrix, using the measures suggested in Table 32.\nThe ratings for the ridership and revenue criteria reflected\nthe effects projected by the Fare Change Model. The\nratings for the other criteria were based on the guidelines\nin Table 32. An example of the resulting ratings is shown\nin Table 33.\n- Develop Alternative Fare Structures--The development\nof alternative fare\nstructures\nentailed\nidentifying\ncombinations of specific options and setting pricing\nlevels for each element. These alternatives were then\nevaluated\n(see\nTable\n32),\nand\npreliminary\nrecommendations were made. Additional specific fare\nstructures were produced and evaluated; more than 30\nscenarios were tested.\n- Develop Set of Alternatives for Further Consideration--\nOn the basis of the preceding assessment, coupled with\nspecific concerns of OCTA staff, a \"short list\" of\nalternatives was developed for consideration by OCTA\nupper management. It was also recommended that OCTA\nstreamline its process for making future fare changes.\nBecause of the inherently political nature of making\nchanges in the overall fare structure, it was suggested that\nOCTA continue to require the Board of Directors to\napprove specifically any changes to the fare system. It\nalso was recommended that OCTA separate the review of\npotential fare changes from the short-range planning\nprocess.\n- Select Fare Structure Modifications--The selection of a\nspecific alternative was made by senior OCTA\nmanagement and adopted by the Board of Directors.\nThere\nwere\nstrong\nproponents\n(primarily\nthe\nTransportation Department) of eliminating transfers and\nreducing the cash fare; however, it was felt that, because\nsuch an approach would mean a major fare increase for\nmany of OCTA's riders, it would be highly inequitable\nand thus publicly unacceptable. On the other hand,\nmanagement was opposed to a fare increase, in light of\nthe economic problems in the County and the fact that\nridership had been declining. Thus, the fare structure\nultimately adopted included relatively minor changes\nfrom the existing structure; the key modifications were a\n10 percent discount on prepaid tickets--which had been\ndropped in 1985--and the institution of free transfers.\nThis structure was implemented in July 1994. Elimination\nof transfers was to be considered further, for possible\nimplementation at some future date.\nDallas Area Rapid Transit\nDART has made several major modifications to its fare\nstructure, since its creation in 1983, having 1) reduced the base\ncash fare from $0.70 to $0.50 in 1984, 2) increased the fare\nfrom $0.50 to $0.75 in 1987, 3) eliminated the zonal structure\nin 1990, and 4) increased the fare from $0.75 to $1.00 in early\n1995. The processes followed in making the 1990 change and\nin the 1993 through 1994 study are outlined here.\nThe review that led to the elimination of the zonal\nsurcharges took place in 1988 and 1989. This review was\nprompted by management and staff concern that the zonal\nstructure was 1) complicated and, therefore, confusing to\nriders and operators; 2) difficult to administer; 3) susceptible\nto fare abuse; 4) a disincentive to ridership; and 5) difficult to\ncollect data on. Thus, a new structure design was undertaken;\nthe key steps were as follows:\n- Evaluate Basic Fare Strategies--This step involved an\nevaluation of the basic fare strategies: flat fare,\ncontinuation\nof\nthe\nzonal\nstructure,\ntime-of-day\ndifferential,\nand\nservice-based\ndifferential.\nThe\nconclusions were that a service-based strategy (i.e., an\nexpress surcharge) made the most sense for DART and\nthat the zonal structure should be discontinued.\n- Develop Elasticities and Fare Model--Fare elasticities\nwere developed on the basis of time series data,\ncomplemented with market surveys of different rider\nsubmarkets.\n- Evaluate Alternative Fare Structures--A Fare Policy\nTask Force was established, which considered the\nestimated ridership and revenue effects of alternative fare\nstructures. A recommendation was made and adopted\n(following review by the Board of Directors and the\npublic at public hearings).\nThe second major study, undertaken in 1993 and 1994, was\nprompted by declining ridership and revenue, as well as the\nneed to integrate the new commuter and light rail lines into the\noverall system. One of the key objectives of this study was to\ndevelop a new set of elasticities (on the basis of stated\npreference survey results) and develop a new fare model. The\ntasks were as follows:\n- Review Past Fare Changes and Elasticities--As a prelude\n\nTABLE 32 Evaluation criteria--decision guidelines--OCTA\nto developing a new set of elasticities and a new fare\nmodel, it was necessary to review the elasticities--and\nmethodologies for developing them--used in the prior\nfare changes. The ridership and revenue effects of these\nchanges and the modeling procedures used were thus\nexamined.\n- Review Peer System Fare Structures--The fare structures\nof 14 similar-size transit systems were reviewed. This\nreview suggested several areas in which DART could\nimprove its current fare structure.\n- Develop Fare Elasticities--An on-board survey was\nperformed to learn the preferences of DART's riders regard\n\nTABLE 33 Fare structure scenarios evaluation--weighted\nWeightings: based on priorities established by OCTA management/staff\n* Rating Key:\n2 = considerably better/greater than current structure\n(See Guidelines for\n1 = somewhat better/greater than current structure\nspecific measures)\n0 = generally same as current structure\n-1 = somewhat worse/less than current structure\n-2 = considerably worse/less than current structure\ning fare and service changes. Respondents were asked\nhow they thought they would respond to a change in fare\ntogether with changes in service quality (e.g., headway,\ndistance to a bus stop, and number of transfers required).\nOn the basis of the responses to these and general use and\nfare payment questions, a set of fare elasticities was\ndeveloped (through the estimation of discrete choice\nmodels) for individual market segments and service\ntypes.\n- Develop Fare Change Model--These elasticities were\nused in the Fare Change Model. The procedure used in\nthe model to estimate ridership is a two-step calculation:\n1) allocate the base case ridership in each submarket\namong the fare medium options, using a \"disutility\nmodel\" for each submarket; and 2) estimate the change in\nridership of each submarket, using the fare elasticity\nmeasure for that submarket. Revenue effects are then\ncalculated on the basis of ridership changes and average\nfare values for each submarket.\n- Review\nFare\nStructure\nElements--This\ninvolved\nidentifying the individual elements of DART's fare\nstructure (e.g., fare strategy, fare levels, and types and\nprices of passes, etc.) and reviewing the options for each\nelement (e.g., flat fare versus peak/off-peak differential\nversus distance-based/zonal structure). Following a\nreview of the advantages and disadvantages of the\ndifferent options, preliminary recommendations were\npresented, suggesting either a specific option or further\nevaluation\nof\ntwo\nor\nmore\noptions.\nThese\nrecommendations provided input into the development\nand evaluation of alternative fare structures.\n- Establish Evaluation Criteria--The criteria selected\nrepresented DART's fare policy goals as well as fare-\nrelated concerns expressed by members of the Fare Policy\nTask Force. A weighting scheme was developed by\nDART management and staff (i.e., the members of the\nFare Policy Task Force).\n- Establish Evaluation Methodology--The alternatives\nwere evaluated using the evaluation criteria, the\nweighting factors, and a set of evaluation measures.\nThese measures reflected the evaluation decision\nguidelines presented in Table 34. An example of an\nevaluation matrix is shown in Table 35.\n- Develop Alternative Fare Structures--Identifying\nalternative\nfare\nstructure\nscenarios\ninvolved\nassembling various combinations of specific options\nand then establishing pricing levels for each fare\nstructure element. A range of scenarios was produced\nand tested in the Fare Change Model; approximately\n20 scenarios were tested. This group was reduced to\neight\nscenarios\nrepresentative\nof\nthe\nvarious\ncombinations of the structural options and specific\n\nTABLE 34 Evaluation criteria and decision guidelines--DART\npricing levels. On the basis of ratings of these scenarios, a\nfinal set of four scenarios was selected for further\nconsideration.\n- Evaluate Alternatives and Recommend New Fare\nStructure--The final scenarios were evaluated using the\nabove methodology. The final recommendation, however,\nreflected\nother\nconsiderations--presented\nthrough\ndiscussions with DART's top management--beyond the\napplication of the evaluation criteria.\nA key issue in DART's decision on the recommended fare\nchanges was the resolution of a technology decision: whether or\nnot to include ticket validators at rail stations (either\nincorporated into the AVMs or as free-standing units). Because\na POP system will be used for rail, use of a multi-ride option\n(i.e., trip-based, rather than time-based, as in a pass) will require\nthat a prepaid ticket be validated at a station on each use; this\nprevents the use of a single ticket more than once. As of this\nwriting, DART had not made a final decision whether or not to\nprovide validators. Depending on the decision, the agency may\neliminate the current multi-ride tickets and introduce weekly\npasses instead. Thus, although new fare collection and\ndistribution equipment and technology generally are viewed as\nbeing able to accommodate a wider variety of fare strategies and\nmedia, this example shows how an equipment decision can limit\nthe types of fare media that can be readily used.\nSeattle/King Co. Metro\nFor the last 10 years, Seattle Metro has had an informal\npolicy of reviewing its fare structure comprehensively every 2\nyears. The most recent comprehensive review took place in\n1992. The process, directed by a task force with members\nfrom research and market strategy and the operations\ndepartment (including representatives of the drivers),\nconsisted of the following key steps:\n- Review Background--This included review of the\nprocess for changes as well as fare levels and strategy and\na review of fare policies and revenue needs.\n- Review\nSpecific\nFare\nElements--This\nfocused\nparticularly on youth fares, special fares for social service\ncustomers, and ticket books.\n- Review Alternative Fare Structures--An econometric\nsystemwide model was used with elasticities and cross\n\nTABLE 35 Fare structure scenarios evaluation--DART\n-1 = worse / less than existing structure\n0 = generally same as existing structure\n1 = better / greater than existing structure\nelasticities to evaluate ridership and revenue effects. The\nalternatives were modified until all revenue requirements\nwere met. Other considerations were social equity,\npolitical\nacceptability,\neffects\non\noperators\nand\noperations, and simplicity. Two alternatives were\nassessed--the first was to increase cash fare with the\nsame basic structure, and the second was to eliminate\nzones and the peak/off-peak differential. At this stage, the\nTransit Committee reduced the revenue requirements\n(and hence the fare level) to ensure smaller ridership\nlosses. Simplification was rejected because the ridership\nloss was predicted to be greater than with the alternative.\nThe zones and time-based differential were retained.\nKey Fare Development and Evaluation Issues\nAlthough many fare development efforts include similar\nsteps, the case studies demonstrate that the focus of the\nevaluation, as well as the order of the steps, can differ\nconsiderably.\nThe\ndifferent\nagencies\nfollow\ndiffering\napproaches, and successive studies at the same agency can\ndiffer in structure. Besides the variation in intent or focus of\nthe study, the development and evaluation efforts often reflect\nwho is performing the study--i.e., particular agency staff,\nwithin one department or as part of a large task force, and\noften outside consultants. As part of this case study effort, the\nresearch team identified several key issues that point up the\ndifferences and similarities among the agencies; these issues\nare as follows:\n- Goals and evaluation criteria,\n- The role of interdepartmental task forces and the Board of\nDirectors,\n- Strategies and issues considered and recommendations,\nand\n- Development of fare elasticities.\nThese issues are discussed below.\nFare Policy Goals and Evaluation Criteria\nTypically, the key goals pursued in fare development\nstudies are related closely to the reasons prompting the review\nin the first place. The goals cited by the case study agencies\nare summarized in Table 36. As shown, several goals are\ncommon to most, if not all, of the case study agencies.\nIncreasing or maximizing ridership and increasing or\nmaximizing revenue are the most frequent goals, the others\nlisted support or are tied directly to these two goals. For\ninstance, simplicity and convenience are related closely to\nridership, and increasing fare recovery is linked directly to\nrevenue.\nOf the goals and criteria identified in Chapter 2, the least\noften used in the case study agencies, at least explicitly, are\nthose related to \"political\" goals--maximizing political\nacceptability and achieving the recovery ratio requirement. As\nnoted earlier, a formal recovery ratio requirement is rare. The\npolitical acceptability rating is not generally included as a\nspecific goal, although the processes are designed so as to\nincorporate them--by Board involvement for example. In the\n1981 OCTA fare review, one of the evaluation criteria was the\nlikely political response, and political effects were noted at NJT in\n\nTABLE 36 Case study fare structure development process\n1993. For the management-related goals identified in Chapter\n2, operational improvements often focused on reducing\noperator and rider interaction, which was thought to result in\ndispute (and, hence, probably delay), operator and passenger\ndissatisfaction, and, on occasion, assault of operators.\nIn virtually all cases, evaluation criteria are taken directly\nfrom goals. To identify the relative importance of the criteria,\nsome agencies weight the criteria. Weighting is done by\nrequesting members of a task force--or perhaps Board\nmembers--to rate the importance of each of a list of\nevaluation criteria. Ridership and revenue effects of a new\npolicy usually receive the highest rankings and equity\nconcerns the lowest. Ridership and revenue criteria tend to\ncancel each other out; thus, even though staff may assign them\nequal weights, one or the other must ultimately be given\npriority in selecting a fare alternative.\nThis ridership-revenue conflict has led, in several cases, to\nthe identification of goals that link the two--e.g., increase\nrevenue without losing ridership. This is a fundamental goal of\nthe deep discounting strategy, which was the focus of several\nof the case study agencies. For instance, in the 1990 CTA fare\nstudy, this goal was achieved through the first year of the new\nfare structure (i.e., until the recession of the early 1990s\ncaused CTA's ridership and revenue to drop sharply; this is\ndiscussed later in this chapter). The smaller case study\nagencies also have focused on this strategy. Typically, there\nhad been a long period without a fare change, which had\nhelped to sustain ridership levels. With the onset of the\nrecession, these authorities were trying to increase revenue\nwithout losing riders. Deep discounting was identified as the\nmost appropriate strategy in these cases.\nFinally, although staff and management usually generate\ngoals and criteria, some agencies involve the public in this\nprocess. For instance, early public participation in the setting\nof evaluation criteria was a feature of development at NJT and\nSCRRA. In 1993, at NJT, public suggestions were a major\nspur to a reconsideration of the fare structure. At SCRRA, the\ninitial fare structure was developed to take into account the\nviews expressed in the public meetings; for example, the\nintegrated transfer policies with connecting local transit\nservices were prompted largely by such comments. In other\ncases, public involvement is not invited until after preliminary\nrecommendations have been developed.\nThe Role of Task Forces and the Board of Directors\nBecause fare policy affects many different aspects of\na transit operation (e.g., finance, revenue collection,\nplanning, operations, administration, and marketing),\nfare structure decisions ideally should have input from\nall affected departments. In recognition of this, all of\nthe case study agencies have ongoing or specially\nconvened fare policy task forces to address fare\n\nissues. As indicated in Table 36, the task force may include\nBoard members (e.g., as with Seattle Metro and SCRRA) or\neven private citizens--perhaps in a separate group in addition\nto the staff task force (e.g., as at MBTA and NJT). Although\nthe actual analysis and development of alternatives typically is\nconducted or supervised by a specific department--and the\ntype of department varies from agency to agency--the task\nforce generally is asked to review findings along the way and\noften to participate in activities such as weighting of criteria\nand making decisions on key issues.\nTable 36 also summarizes the nature of Board involvement\nin fare decisions. The role of the Board differs according to the\nsize of the agency. The most common mode among the larger\nagencies is that the Board does not get involved until the end\nof the process, i.e., after the recommendations have been\ndeveloped. In contrast, the smaller agencies' Boards apparently\nwere involved earlier in the fare studies--generally on an\nongoing basis.\nStrategies and Issues Considered and Study Recommendations\nA fundamental difference among fare reviews lies in the\ntypes of fare strategies considered. On the basis of the case\nstudies, most fare reviews address only a subset of the\navailable fare differentiation strategies. As indicated in Table\n36, few of the agencies typically consider all of the basic\nstrategies in their fare policy and structure studies. In fact, the\nsmaller agencies apparently tend not to consider zonal options\nexplicitly at all, although a few have looked at peak/off-peak\ndifferentials and express surcharges. Most of these agencies\nundertake infrequent reviews; when they do, they focus\nprimarily on fare levels and prepayment options (including\ndeep discounting).\nThere is considerably greater variation in the types of\nstudies carried out by the larger agencies. Although most\nreviews tend to focus on fare levels and prepayment (as at the\nsmaller agencies), most of the larger agencies have conducted\nat least one comprehensive evaluation of the overall fare\nstructure that has included an assessment of the potential for\nmaking major structural revisions. Typically, each agency\nconducts one full evaluation of all basic strategies (e.g., CTA\nin 1987, OCTA in 1981, DART in 1990, and Seattle Metro in\n1993) and does not seriously reconsider the rejected options in\nsubsequent studies. For instance, in the 1993 and 1994 studies\nfor OCTA and DART, distance-based and time-of-day-based\nstrategies were considered but were rejected before formal\ndevelopment and evaluation of alternatives were begun. In the\nlatter\ncases--and\nindeed\nin\nmost\nfare\nreviews--the\n\"alternatives\" developed represent combinations of different\npricing levels (and discounts, where applicable) for the various\nelements of the fare structure (e.g., full local cash fare,\nreduced local cash fare, express fare, monthly pass price, and\ntransfer price).\nThe fare structure evaluations have produced a range of\nrecommendations; however, these recommendations have not\nalways been accepted by the Board or top management. The\nmost significant structural recommendations from the most\nrecent comprehensive fare reviews are summarized in Table\n37; for several agencies, results of prior major reviews also are\npresented. The evaluations and findings and recommendations\nregarding the basic fare differentiation strategies are discussed\nbelow.\nDistance-Based Pricing. None of the case study agencies\nhas considered or operates pure distance-based pricing and\nnone of the smaller agencies has or has considered a zonal\nstructure. SCRRA has been assessing the potential for station-\nto-station pricing, a variation on the current zonal structure.\nNJT, which inherited a pure distance-based system in 1979,\nremoved it in favor of a zonal structure in 1982. Seattle Metro\nand MBTA also have limited zonal pricing. Seattle Metro\noriginally had an extensive zonal system but simplified it to\ntwo zones in 1977. For MBTA, the zones are most relevant on\nthe commuter rail, because, for most local bus and subway\npassengers, trips are made within the central zone.\nThe fare task force in Seattle considered abandoning the\nzone structure during the 1992 review in order to simplify the\nfare structure. CTA considered zonal pricing in 1987 but\nrejected it after the evaluation. The conclusion was that \"the\nhigh capital costs of the fare equipment necessary for distance\nbased charging could not be justified by additional revenue\nraised, as this method was no more efficient at raising revenue\nthan the present flat fare system.\" Since then, zonal options\nhave not been revisited, and the new electronic fare collection\nsystem being developed is not configured to facilitate\ndistance-based pricing (i.e., with exit turnstiles to calculate\ndistance traveled, as in WMATA and BART). DART\neliminated its zonal pricing system in 1990; the zones were\nremoved in favor of a service-based policy, because this was\nseen as the optimal choice in terms of \"equity, fare collection,\nunderstandability, revenue and ridership.\" When a zone-based\nsystem was proposed for OCTA in 1981 (on a limited basis for\ntesting operational implications), the Board rejected the\nsuggestion. In 1994, a zonal structure was considered but\nrejected early in the evaluation.\nThus, even with the advent of electronic technologies,\ntransit agencies typically are not increasing their consideration\nof distance-based/zonal pricing strategies. The complexities\nassociated with design, implementation, administration, and\nunderstanding by riders are seen as major barriers, and the\ntheoretical benefits (e.g., greater revenue and greater equity)\ngenerally are not viewed as worth the cost involved.\nPeak/Off-Peak Differential. In contrast to zonal pricing, this\nfare differentiation strategy has been seriously considered by\nsome of the smaller operators (e.g., Madison Metro and\nTARC). TARC has had a peak/off-peak differential since 1980\nand decided to retain the peak surcharge for cash only in 1993;\ndiscounted tickets have the same price all day. The peak/off\npeak structure was retained for cash in order to encourage\ncommuters to purchase tickets. Madison considered a\npeak/off-peak structure in a preliminary stage of the 1991 fare\nstudy, but it was rejected for operational reasons.\nMost of the larger agencies have considered time-of-day\npricing at one time or another, but only two (i.e., CTA, on bus\n\nTABLE 37 Case study sources of elasticities and evaluation results\nonly, and Seattle Metro) offer it for full-fare riders. In other\ncases, operational concerns, particularly related to the\ntransition from peak to off-peak (or vice versa), have caused\nthe agencies to reject this option. At CTA, for example,\nconcerns about the agency's ability to prevent rail ticket agent\n\"skimming\" of revenues led to the decision to introduce a\ndifferential on bus only. At DART, the peak/off-peak option\nwas rejected after the preliminary evaluation stage, because its\nrevenue and ridership effects were deemed insufficient to\noffset the operational and administrative complexities. OCTA\nhad a peak/off-peak differential for some years but eliminated\nit in 1985, when the agency decided that the disadvantages of\nthe strategy--administrative and operational difficulties,\nconfusion among users, and lower revenue than in a flat fare\nstructure--were more significant than the ridership and equity\nadvantages. On the other hand, the agency retained a peak/off\npeak differential for reduced fares (e.g., senior citizens and\nriders with disabilities) and continues to do so today.\nService-Based\nDifferential.\nThis\ncategory\ncovers\ndifferentials by mode (e.g., bus-rail) or type of service (e.g.,\nlocal-express). Among the case study agencies, only MBTA\nhas a bus-rail differential: $0.85 for rail, $0.60 for bus. CTA\nremoved its $0.10 rail premium in 1988, although, there is a\ndifferential during off-peak hours (driven not by the desire to\ncharge more for rail but by operational constraints on the rail\nsystem precluding a peak/off-peak differential. Both BSDA\nand DART recently addressed the issue of pricing new LRT\nlines; in both cases, the decision was to charge the same on\nLRT as for local bus. Both agencies had established\nintegration of bus and LRT and fare simplification as key\ngoals. For its new commuter rail service, DART opted to\ncharge the same as on its express bus service--$1 higher than\nthe local/LRT rate.\nFour of the case study agencies have a premium fare for\nexpress service (i.e., MBTA, NJT, DART, and MVRTA).\nOCTA had an express premium until 1992; reinstitution of the\ndifferential was considered in 1994 but rejected because of the\ndesire to avoid any fare increases then. BSDA eliminated the\nhigher express fare in 1993 for its Missouri service, although\nthe two Illinois counties maintained the express premium for\ntheir BSDA service. The elimination of the express surcharge\nat DART was evaluated during the recent study, but the\nagency decided to retain the differential in order to maximize\nrevenue.\nThus, the use of fare differentiation on the basis of distance,\ntime of day, or service quality has decreased somewhat as\nagencies have sought to increase convenience to the rider and\nease of administration of fare collection. At the same time,\nthere has been an increasing push for expanding the use of\nprepaid fare mechanisms targeted to different market\nsegments. The smaller agencies in particular have embraced\n\ndeep discounting as a means of raising the cash fare without\nlosing ridership, and the larger agencies have at least\nconsidered this approach; some have adopted adeep discount\noption--others have preferred to minimize cash fares and have\ndecided against it.\nThe introduction of electronic fare collection will\nsignificantly expand the opportunity to offer a wide range of\nfare options and discounts for prepayment--all using a single\nfarecard,\nthereby\nmaximizing\nrider\nconvenience\nand\nminimizing\noperator\nand\nadministrative\nrequirements.\nSelecting the appropriate mechanisms and pricing levels in\nsuch a system, however, considerably complicates the\ndevelopment and evaluation process. NYMTA, in its 2-year\nfare structure development effort, developed and evaluated\nmore than 1000 fare packages; the study included extensive\nsurveying of riders and non-riders and development of a\ncomplex\nridership-revenue\nmodel\nand\nevaluation\nmethodology. CTA also conducted a fare development study\nfor its electronic fare collection system. The initial phase of\nthe effort has focused on identifying a range of options and\ndeveloping a new fare model designed to evaluate these new\noptions; the development and evaluation of potential fare\npackages will be conducted in a later phase. Thus, while these\nand other agencies will continue to employ the general\ndevelopment and evaluation steps described in this chapter,\ncertain aspects of the process, particularly identifying potential\noptions and packages and estimating ridership and revenue\neffects, will grow in complexity.\nDevelopment of Fare Elasticities\nAs shown in the case studies, there are several ways of\ndeveloping elasticities for use in predicting the ridership effect\nof a fare change. There are also differences in the application\nof elasticities; some agencies use a single systemwide\nelasticity, while others use a different figure for each mode.\nWhat is becoming increasingly common, however, is to\nidentify a series of elasticities representing the various\nsubmarkets constituting total ridership.\nThe sources of elasticities for the case studies are\nsummarized in Table 37. The major types of sources include\nthe following:\n- Time series analysis of the agency's historical ridership\ndata--this often includes a regression analysis to isolate\nthe effects of fare changes from other factors, such as\nservice changes, employment, or fuel prices;\n- Before-after (\"shrinkage\") analysis for a particular fare\nchange;\n- Use of a demand function, often on the basis of the results\nof stated preference surveys (i.e., asking how people\nwould respond to various fare options and changes, or\nalternatively asking them to \"trade off\" fare changes with\nlevel-of-service changes);\n- Review of industry experience, particularly for agencies\nof similar size and with similar characteristics; and\n- Use of professional judgment in adjusting figures derived\nfrom the above sources.\nThere are also various types of elasticity equations; the most\ncommon are those known as point elasticity, shrinkage ratio,\nmidpoint arc elasticity, and constant arc elasticity. For small\nchanges (i.e., less than 10 percent), each formula should\nproduce roughly the same elasticity. The midpoint or constant\narc elasticity formulas, however, generally are used where\nlarger changes are involved--or where there may be a\ndecrease in some fare categories.\nThe specific equation used influences the resulting elasticity\nfigures but has a much smaller effect than does the basic\nsource or derivation approach. In fact, the case studies have\nshown that the source and approach can affect the elasticities\nidentified for an agency greatly. This is demonstrated\ndramatically in the case of DART, which has used several\ndifferent methods over the years and has ended up with\nsubstantially different figures. For instance, following the\n1987 fare change, two separate time-series analyses were\nperformed--each considering several service-related and\nsocioeconomic factors in addition to DART's ridership trends.\nThese analyses yielded considerably different elasticities for\nthe major service types (e.g., -0.64 versus -0.35 for local bus\nservice). There were differences in the exact data used,\nassumptions made, specific analytical techniques applied, or\ncombinations thereof. These differences underscore the\ndifficulties inherent in identifying specific elasticity figures\nappropriate for use in forecasting the ridership effects of fare\nchanges. The elasticity estimate depends heavily on the\nparticular analysis technique and data used. Largely because\nof the discrepancy in the two sets of figures, DART decided to\nuse stated preference analysis to develop elasticities for a new\nfare model in the 1993 and 1994 fare study. The aggregate\nelasticity for local service was determined to be -0.40.\nThe approach that many agencies take in identifying\nelasticities is to calculate figures on the basis of their own\nridership patterns and corroborate--and possibly adjust--\nthese numbers on the basis of figures from other agencies.\nThis approach is used sometimes for developing market\nsegment elasticities, for instance, on the basis of a single\nsystemwide figure; industry guidelines on ratios of elasticities\nfor different markets--e.g., off-peak elasticities are often\nfound to be 1.5-2 times peak elasticities--are applied to derive\nfigures for the agency. This approach was taken in the recent\nOCTA study and at CTA, for example. The OCTA study's\npeer review included the identification of the peer agencies'\nelasticities. With regard to available sources of industry\nexperience, a recent APTA study, Fare Elasticity and Its\nApplication to Forecasting Transit Demand (August 1991)\ndeveloped systemwide and peak/off-peak elasticities for 52\nU.S. bus systems. Finally, many agencies continue to use the\nlong-time industry standard \"Simpson-Curtin Rule\" (roughly\n0.30).\nThe Simpson-Curtin rule notwithstanding, there are no\nindustry standards regarded as the most appropriate method\nfor calculating or applying fare elasticities. Part of the reason\nis the difficulty inherent in isolating the effect of fare changes\non ridership.\n\nRIDERSHIP AND REVENUE IMPACTS OF FARE\nCHANGES\nThe fare level is only one of many factors that can affect\ntransit ridership. Important influences include changes in the\nlocal economy (e.g., prices of goods, employment and\nunemployment levels, and household incomes), the level of\nservice provided, changing development and regional travel\npatterns, and the costs--in money and time--of alternative\nforms of transportation. Isolating the direct effects of fare\nchanges on ridership and revenue is, therefore, quite difficult.\nIt is, however, important to understand the effects of fares on\ndemand in making fare changes.\nIn conducting the case studies, the project team reviewed\nridership and revenue changes over the past several years. The\nresearch team also reviewed the results of efforts to analyze\nfare and other factors' effects on ridership and revenue. This\nsection presents the overall trends at the case study agencies\n(separated by size of agency), summarizes the effects of fare\nreductions (including reducing cash fares, introducing a deep\nTABLE 38 Revenue--percentage change from previous year\ndiscount, and reducing transfer charges), and discusses issues\nassociated with identifying the effects on ridership of fares\nversus other factors.\nOverall Ridership and Revenue Trends\nIn order to develop some understanding of the effects of\nfares on ridership and revenue, it is useful, first of all, to\nreview the individual ridership and revenue trends and to\ncompare them to those of similar-size agencies. Tables 38 and\n39 and Figures 2 through 7 summarize the percentage changes\nin systemwide (unlinked) ridership and fare revenue for the\ncase study agencies for the period from 1987 through 1992.\n(Earlier data are provided in several of the individual case\nstudies. SCRRA is not included in this discussion, because it\nis a new system.)\nLooking first at overall trends, the figures show that, in\ngeneral, fare revenue was growing during this period: of the 11\nagencies considered here, only DART, BSDA, and MVRTA\nTABLE 39 Ridership--percentage change from previous year\n\nFigure 2. Change in revenue--largest systems.\nlost revenue over the period as a whole. Individual fare\nincreases enabled the agencies to increase revenues in most\ncases, with only 5 of the 18 increases during the period not\nproducing higher revenue in the following year. Three\nagencies (i.e., NJT, CTA, and BSDA) lost riders, thus, BSDA\nwas the only case study agency to suffer overall declines in\nboth measures. GLPTC is notable for its very large overall\ngrowth in both revenue, 88 percent, and ridership, 64 percent.\nThe 1990-1991 period appears to have been significant for\nmost agencies, and this coincides with the onset of the recent\nrecession. For three agencies (i.e., CTA, MBTA, and BSDA),\nboth revenue and ridership fell in 1991; ridership also declined\nin that year at NJT, as did revenue at MVRTA and DART.\nDifferences by Size of Agency\nLargest Systems\nThe revenue and ridership changes for the three largest of\nthe case study agencies (i.e., NJT, CTA, and MBTA) are\nshown in Figures 2 and 3, respectively. The recession of the\nlate-1980s and early 1990s hit these areas hard, leading to\nrevenue and ridership declines on CTA and MBTA--and a\nridership loss on NJT--in 1991; NJT's revenue rose in 1991\nbut by a smaller percentage than in the prior 2 years. The\nrelative trends actually are quite similar for CTA and MBTA\nfrom 1989 to 1992, although CTA has apparently suffered\nmore from the recession. Staff at all three of these agencies\nfeel\nthat\nthe\neconomic\nclimate--specifically\nfalling\nemployment--contributed to the negative ridership trend in\n1990 and 1991. The employment boom from 1985 onward had\nhelped many agencies maintain nominal fare levels through\nmuch of the decade--without cutting service and while\nenjoying increased farebox revenues. When employment\nbegan to fall off, however, trip rates declined, and, at agencies\nsuch as CTA and MBTA, farebox revenues also suffered.\nAs shown in Figures 2 and 3, MBTA has experienced\nconsiderable fluctuation in ridership and revenue during the\nreview period; in 1988, ridership rose dramatically, but it\nleveled off in 1989, following a fare change; the fare change\napparently had little effect on revenue, though, because it rose\nonly slightly. Following another substantial ridership increase\nin 1990, MBTA suffered a ridership loss in 1991. MBTA had\ncalculated, through a regression analysis, that over half of the\nridership loss after the 1991 fare increase could be attributed\nto the higher fares. During that year, however, the recessionary\neffects had been exerting downward pressure on ridership\nlevels before the fare increase. The trend analysis performed in\n1991 showed that ridership had been falling for the first 8\nmonths of the year--before the fare increase--and thus the\n\nFigure 3.\nChange in ridership--largest systems.\nregression analysis may well have overestimated the direct\neffects of the fare increase on ridership. Ridership recovered\nsomewhat in 1992, despite the recession still strongly affecting\nthe region, and the 1991 fare increase apparently led to the\nmajor jump in revenue in 1992.\nAs shown in Figures 2 and 3, NJT's revenue and ridership\npatterns were relatively consistent during the analysis period.\nRidership declined somewhat (1 to 6 percent) every year until\n1992, when it experienced a slight upturn; the loss deepened in\n1991, consistent with the trend at CTA and MBTA.\nConversely, NJT's revenues grew each year until 1992, when\nthey remained essentially unchanged. In terms of specific\nmodes, aggregate rail ridership increased after the 1988 fare\nincrease, although the routes to downtown Manhattan suffered\nridership losses--attributed to extensive lay-offs on Wall\nStreet that year. Bus routes lost around 2.5 percent of their\nriders in the same period; roughly one-third of this loss was\nattributed directly to the fare increase, the remainder to the\ndepressed economy.\nRidership on CTA was falling throughout much of this\nperiod, with a significant downturn in 1991. Following the\n1988 fare increase, CTA experienced substantial revenue\ngain--but with a ridership loss. The next year (1989), the\ndecline in ridership was much smaller, but revenue grew by an\neven smaller percentage than did ridership. Seeking to\nincrease both revenue and ridership, CTA decided to introduce\na deep discount on tokens as an integral part of an overall\nconsumer-based pricing structure. The Authority succeeded in\nits goal of increasing revenue (the revenue target for the fare\nchange was actually exceeded) without losing ridership.\nRidership and revenue both fell sharply in 1991. The recession\nhit Chicago in early 1991, marked by rising unemployment\nand a generally slow economy. CTA planners blame the\nridership and revenue losses solely on the economic downturn,\nrather than on any delayed fare structure effect. Because of the\nrevenue loss, the Authority felt the need to increase fares in\nDecember 1991. This fare increase served to reverse the\nrevenue decline--1992 fare revenue grew significantly;\nhowever, the fare increase also contributed to an acceleration\nin the loss of ridership, as ridership continued to decline. In\norder to continue the revenue growth, CTA has modified its\npricing three times since mid-1992.\nLarge Systems\nFigures 4 and 5 display the revenue and ridership changes\nfor the four \"large\" case study agencies (i.e., DART, Seattle\n\nFigure 4.\nChange in revenue--large systems.\nMetro, OCTA, and BSDA). The figures show that there has\nbeen considerable variation in each of these agencies' trends,\ni.e., in terms of the magnitude of year-to-year changes. On the\nother hand, there are general consistencies in the direction of the\nchanges. Seattle Metro and OCTA experienced ridership and\nrevenue growth (or, at worst, no change) each year, although the\nrate of ridership increase at both agencies dropped to essentially\nno change by 1991. Seattle Metro's ridership expansion\noccurred despite fare increases in 1989 and 1991. One of the\nkey factors driving the ridership growth in general was the\nsignificant growth in employment during the late 1980s. This\ngrowth slowed considerably in 1990, however, and it has\nremained relatively even since then. As shown in Figure 4, the\ntwo fare increases resulted in strong revenue growth.\nOCTA's ridership rose, along with revenue, despite annual\nfare increases between 1988 and 1991; in other words, the\nagency's revenue and ridership growth slowed greatly at the\nend of this series of fare increases. The leveling off of\nridership in 1991 is attributed to a serious decline in the local\neconomy. Orange County had benefited from a booming\neconomy throughout the 1980s, but employment in the County\ndropped considerably beginning in 1991, as the recession\nfinally reached Southern California.\nIn contrast to Metro and OCTA, BSDA lost ridership in\nevery year of the analysis, although the percentage of the loss\ndeclined each year--until 1992; unfortunately, the agency\ngained revenue in only one of the years--1989. The ridership\nloss trend actually had begun in the early 1980s. BSDA had\nreduced service by a third during the decade (because of\ninsufficient and declining operating assistance), and ridership\nhad been further eroded by residential and employment shifts\nwithin the region--i.e., away from the City of St. Louis\ntoward the suburbs. In an attempt to isolate the effect of the\n1991 fare change, a regression analysis was carried out that\nconsidered cash fare, regional employment, and gas price, as\nwell as a seasonal factor. None of the variables was found to be\na significant factor in the loss of ridership. It was concluded that\nthe service reductions and the increasing suburbanization of the\n\nFigure 5.\nChange in ridership--large systems.\nregion, coupled with a lack of sufficient marketing caused this\ngeneral downward trend. BSDA's ridership has grown since\nmid 1993--primarily because of the popularity of the new\nLRT line; however, the reduction of express fares also\napparently has contributed to this increase.\nDART experienced the largest single ridership loss of any\nof the large or largest agencies--18 percent in 1988 to 1989.\nIn 1987, DART had instituted a 50 percent increase in the cash\nfare, while reducing service mileage. This change, in\nconjunction with falling gas prices that made automobile\ntravel more attractive and increasing unemployment in the\nregion (the result of the falling gas prices), resulted in the\nmajor ridership decline and then led to the 1990 fare\nmodification (the elimination of zones). This effective fare\ndecrease led to the reversal of the ridership and revenue\ntrends, i.e., ridership increases in the next couple of years, but\naccompanied by revenue losses. Unfortunately, the ridership\ntrend has now reversed again, with a decline in 1993.\nTo identify the long-term effect of fares and other factors on\nDART's ridership, a regression analysis was undertaken,\nlooking at service provided, gas prices, and regional\nemployment, as well as fares for the period between 1985 and\n1993. It was found that there were strong statistical\nrelationships between ridership and fares, revenue miles, and\ngas prices; amount of service was actually found to be the\nmost important variable. Regional employment did not display\na strong correlation, although it should be noted that City of\nDallas employment figures were not available for all years and\nthus not used, and a significant portion of the regional\nemployment is not well-served by DART. The analysis also\nrevealed a downward trend beyond the effect that could be\nassociated with the other factors; it was felt that this trend may\nbe reflecting the trend of declining employment in the City.\nThus, fares were determined to have a significant relationship\nwith ridership over the long term (i.e., nearly a decade),\nalthough it is just one of several important factors.\nMedium and Small Systems\nThe medium and small case study agencies are TARC,\nMadison Metro, MVRTA, and GLPTC. Revenue and ridership\ntrends for these agencies are shown in Figures 6 and 7,\nrespectively. Other than Madison Metro, these agencies\ndemonstrate considerable variability in ridership over the\nperiod reviewed. In contrast, except for the large 1990 to 1991\nchange at GLPTC, revenue trends were relatively stable. It is\nimportant to note that these smaller agencies have tended to\nhave very few fare changes over the last decade or more.\nTARC did not change its fares between 1980 and 1993, and,\nas indicated in Tables 37 and 38 and Figure 6, revenue\nremained relatively stable. Ridership, on the other hand, was\n\nFigure 6.\nChange in revenue--small systems.\nundergoing steady increases until a major drop in 1990--the\nlargest 1-year decline of any of the case study agencies. The\neconomic downturn in the area was felt to have contributed to\nthis change, although ridership rebounded in 1991 and\ncontinued to grow in 1992. No detailed analysis was\nundertaken to explain this dramatic turnaround, and it is\npossible that inconsistencies in ridership data may explain at\nleast part of this pattern.\nUnlike the other agencies, the economy of the City of\nMadison was not affected by the recent recession; the presence\nof two large and stable employers--the University of\nWisconsin and the state government--has helped the local\neconomy remain relatively strong. There was a steady\ndownward trend in ridership through the 1980s (with a loss of\nover 30 percent in that decade), which was attributed largely\nto the suburbanization of the city, increasing real income, and\nfalling real gas prices. Both revenue and ridership began to\nturn around in 1990, apparently because of an effective\nmarketing campaign. The upward trends were then reinforced\nby a major route restructuring and service expansion and the\nintroduction of deep discounting in 1991. Revenue increased\nagain in 1993, while ridership remained roughly the same as in\n1992, despite a second fare change.\nMVRTA had a long-term strategy to increase ridership\nthrough the 1980s; thus, fares were not changed from 1982 to\n1993. As shown in Table 39 and Figure 7, ridership had\ndisplayed substantial growth in 1988 and 1990, with the 1990\nincrease the largest single-year increase of any of the case study\nagencies. The economic downturn in 1990, however, affected\nridership levels significantly (i.e., a 17 percent fall from 1990 to\n1991),\nand\nthis\nwas\nattributed\nlargely\nto\nincreased\nunemployment and the closing of a large downtown department\nstore. Generally, employment had been increasing during the\n1980s but began to fall significantly in 1990. Revenue has\ndisplayed less variation, although it dropped somewhat in 1992.\nThe 1993 fare change, in which fares were increased along with\nthe introduction of a deep discount, has resulted in a substantial\nrevenue increase, although ridership suffered a decline\nfollowing the change, before stabilizing of late.\nGLPTC experienced steady growth in both ridership and\nrevenue during the period reviewed until both declined in 1992.\nGLPTC has a considerable amount of contract service, which\nhas fluctuated over the past several years. An increase in the\namount of this service (e.g., at Purdue University and to several\napartment complexes) apparently spurred much of the ridership\nand revenue growth in the late 1980s. Some service reduction\n\nFigure 7.\nChange in ridership--small systems.\nin 1991 was thought to have led to the fall in revenue and\nridership in 1992.\nEffects of Fare Reductions\nThis section discusses the effect on revenue and ridership of\nreducing fare levels. Two major categories of reductions are\nreviewed: lowering the cash fare and introducing a deep\ndiscount for prepayment. A third approach--reducing transfer\nfees--also is discussed briefly.\nReduction of Cash Fare\nCash fare reductions are relatively rare, given the general\nconcern with maximizing revenue. Effective reductions have\nbeen introduced through prepaid discounts, but these typically\naccompany cash fare increases. Certain fare elements,\nhowever, have been lowered (e.g., the elimination of an\nexpress surcharge, as BSDA did in 1993); full cash fares have,\non occasion, been reduced (e.g., at DART in 1984); and other\nagencies have considered such an action--as a means of\nboosting ridership. OCTA considered a fare reduction in its\nmost recent fare study, in conjunction with elimination of\nreduced-price transfers. Fare reductions also sometimes are\nsuggested by public officials or rider groups; for instance, it\nhas been suggested on occasion that, because transit is a\n\"public good,\" it should be provided free of charge.\nThe discussion here focuses on the revenue and ridership\neffects of reducing fares, although effects on operating cost\n(e.g., increases because of the need to add service, savings\nfrom reductions in bus running times, and the elimination of\nfare collection and evasion monitoring costs if fares are\neliminated) are also likely. There may also be an effect on\noperators' morale of instituting free fares--possibly positive\nand negative. The positive effect would come chiefly through\nreductions in the frequency of confrontations between\npassengers and operators and of assaults on operators.\nOffering free service can lead operators to feel that their\nefforts have no value because they are providing a service that\napparently has no value. Furthermore, eliminating fares can\nresult\nin\nexcessive\ncrowding\nof\nvehicles,\npossibly\ndiscouraging former fare-paying customers from riding. Thus,\nthe full effect must be assessed by any agency considering\nreduction or elimination of fares. Brief reviews of two\ninstances of fare reduction from the case studies follow.\nDART. At the time of its creation in 1984, DART lowered the\nbase cash fare from $0.70 to $0.50 and the monthly pass price\nfrom $26.00 to $20.00, while removing the $0.10 transfer fee (in\nfavor of free transfers). Comparing the period January\n\nto March 1983 with the period January to March 1984, ridership\nincreased by 16 percent. DART also began a significant service\nexpansion later in 1984. By late 1986, the fare change and\nservice improvements had combined to produce a nearly 50\npercent increase in ridership from the pre-DART level.\nAfter a revenue loss of 11 percent in the first year of the\nnew fares, fare revenue increased, but the increases did not\noutweigh the increased operating costs of the new services,\nand cost recovery fell to less than 25 percent in 1986. Thus,\nthe fare reduction was reversed (as were many of the service\nimprovements). The base fare was increased to $0.75 in\nFebruary 1987 and monthly pass prices to $27. These changes\nincreased the cost recovery ratio to 33.5 percent, but the loss\nof ridership (nearly 13 percent) exceeded expectations and the\nincrease in revenue was less than half the anticipated amount.\nOne interesting finding from analyzing these fare changes\nwas that the fare elasticity calculated for the fare decrease\n(adjusted for amount of service and gas prices) was -0.39, very\nclose to that for the fare increase, -0.35. This suggests that\nriders display roughly the same degree of sensitivity to a fare\ndecrease as to an increase; this result contrasts with other\nstudies that found that ridership tends to be significantly less\nresponsive to decreases than to increases (i.e., if an agency\nraises fares and then lowers them to the original level,\nridership will be lower than if fares had remained constant).\nBSDA. In conjunction with the opening of the light rail line\nin 1993, BSDA initiated a new fare structure. One of the\nchanges within this package was to eliminate the express\nsurcharge in Missouri, reducing the express cash fare from\n$1.30 to $1.00 and the express monthly pass price from $42.00\nto $35.00 (i.e., the local fare and pass levels). At the same\ntime, the cost of transferring was halved from $0.20 to $0.10,\nand a substantial amount of the express service was\nwithdrawn. Comparing the year-to-year changes in ridership\non the express routes that continued to operate revealed that\nridership on those routes rose 9 percent from April 1993 to\nApril 1994, in contrast to a 1 percent loss on all services, as\nwell as a 10 percent loss on these express routes the prior year.\nThere was considerable variation of ridership changes on the\nindividual express routes: from a 17 percent drop to a 60\npercent rise. Half of the routes, however, experienced\nincreases of between 3 and 15 percent. (Data on revenue on\nthese routes were not available.)\nIntroducing Deep Discounts\nThe use of deep discounting has been shown to be an\nimportant pricing and marketing strategy. In contrast to the\nreduction of cash fares, it involves offering a lower fare option\nthrough prepurchase of multi-rides (i.e., other than a pass).\nThe strategy allows an agency to raise cash fares--and thus\ngenerate increased revenues--but can minimize or perhaps\nneutralize the ridership loss that would otherwise be expected\nwith an increase. The case studies provide illustrations of deep\ndiscounting strategies that have been adopted in larger and\nsmaller agencies, although such strategies are more heavily\nrepresented here among the smaller agencies. Summaries of\nthe ridership and revenue effects of three of the case study\nexperiences follow.\nCTA. In April 1990, CTA introduced a consumer-based fare\nstructure that featured a decrease in the unit price of 10 tokens\n(from $0.95 to $0.90) and increased the base cash fare from $1\nto $1.25. By the end of that year, revenue had increased (in\nfact, the target revenue for the fare change was exceeded)\nwithout a loss in ridership. CTA also greatly increased the\nextent of prepayment (by token and pass), a key goal of the\nfare change; token use rose by 240 percent. Unfortunately,\nboth ridership and revenue fell sharply in 1991--apparently\nbecause of the recession. Because of the revenue loss, CTA\nraised fares again in 1991. The deep discount was retained,\nalthough the level of the discount was reduced somewhat;\nnevertheless, token use increased by 44 percent in 1991, and\noverall prepayment rose again. Ridership continued to fall,\nalthough revenue rebounded in 1992. Thus, while the effects\nof the recession have masked the longer-term effects of the\ndeep discounting approach, CTA management has considered\nit worth retaining--despite the need to generate greater\nrevenue-- because the strategy is perceived as minimizing\nridership loss when cash fares are increased.\nMadison Metro. In August 1991, Madison Metro raised the\ncash fare from $0.75 to $1.00 and introduced a 10-ride pack of\ntickets for $0.75 apiece. Ridership had been falling in 1988\nand 1989 following a fare increase in 1987. Ridership\nstabilized in 1990. Restructuring of services in early 1991 was\na major factor in maintaining that growth, but the deep\ndiscounting in August allowed Madison Metro to gain\nadditional revenues, while ensuring continued ridership\ngrowth. Revenue has grown in each of the last 4 years, while\nridership has been maintained.\nGLPTC. In February of 1988, GLPTC introduced a 10-ride\ncard at a 20 percent discount on the cash fare as a mail order\npromotion. No other changes in the fare structure were made.\nDirect mailings were sent to nearly every household in the\nGLPTC service area; by June of 1988, ridership had grown by\n5 percent and adult fare revenue had grown by 11 percent. The\nFareSavers became a permanent part of the fare structure at\nthe end of 1988, and ridership and revenue continued to grow\nin 1989. These increases were substantially in excess of the\nservice increases in these years. This example differs from the\nothers in that the sole fare change was the introduction of a\ndiscount, whereas the more common approach is to increase\ncash fares as well.\nReducing Transfer Charges\nAs indicated in Chapter 3, for many agencies, including\nthose studied here, issues related to the policy and pricing of\ntransfers between modes and between routes have been a key\n\narea of concern. Transfer payment is felt to be a major source\nof fare evasion and confrontation between operators and\npassengers. Thus, when considering reducing transfer prices,\nintroducing free transfers, or abolishing transfers altogether,\nthere are trade-offs between the effect on revenue and effects\non operational efficiency, operator welfare, and passenger\nconvenience. Two examples of case study agencies that have\nreduced transfer charges are discussed below; unfortunately,\nthe ability to isolate the effects of these changes is hampered\nbecause the changes invariably came as part of general fare\nstructure modifications.\nDART. DART removed the transfer fee from its fare\nstructure in 1984. The revenue and ridership effects of this\nwere tied in with the effects of the lower cash fare; however,\nthe agency noted a small increase in the share of transfer\nboardings in the year following the fare changes. It is\nnoteworthy that the transfer fee was eliminated at the same\ntime that the cash fare was reduced. A more usual approach is\nto increase the cash fare if free transfers are to be allowed or,\nconversely, to offer a lower cash fare where reduced price\ntransfers are being eliminated.\nOCTA. OCTA operated from 1977 until 1991 without\ncharging for transfers. As part of a new fare policy in 1991, a\ntransfer charge of $0.05 was introduced. At the same time,\nfares were increased. In 1993 and 1994, transfer policy was a\nkey element of the fare policy review. The grid system means\nthat roughly 47 percent of riders transfer at least once to\ncomplete their trips. This high rate of transferring, coupled\nwith a concern about the level of transfer abuse and the extent\nof confrontations between operators and transferring riders,\nmakes transfer policy a major issue for the agency. Various\noptions were considered, including both allowing free\ntransfers and eliminating transfers altogether (concomitant\nwith a substantial cash fare reduction). Among OCTA senior\nmanagement, there were strong proponents for the latter\npolicy; however, because this would lead to a substantial fare\nincrease for many of OCTA's riders, it was decided, instead, to\nreturn to free transfers for now. The possibility of eliminating\ntransfers in the future has not been ruled out, however, and\nwill be considered further.\nIdentifying the Effects of Fares Versus Other Factors\nFare is just one of many factors affecting transit use. The\ncase study analyses show that economic variables (e.g.,\nemployment and gas prices), development patterns, transit\nservice levels, and marketing all influence ridership. Transit\nagencies seek to identify the effects of fare changes on\nridership and revenue in order to predict the effects of future\nfare changes. There is a need, therefore, to understand the\nnature of other factors affecting operating conditions and\ndemand and to appreciate that different factors will be felt\nwith different intensities and often with different time lags.\nFor instance, increasing unemployment may result in an\nimmediate ridership loss, while increasing suburbanization\nwill have longer-term effects on ridership. In multimodal\nagencies, or where an agency faces competition from other\narea operators, the effect of other fare strategies also may\naffect ridership on a particular mode. For instance, bus and rail\neach will have their own fare elasticity measure, as well as\n\"cross-elasticities\" with respect to change in fare on the\nalternative mode. Furthermore, for each service, there is an\nelasticity with respect to other variables, such as service level\nor employment.\nAs discussed in the section on Development of Fare\nElasticities, time series regression techniques are often used to\nisolate the effects of the different exogenous variables, with\nthe aim of identifying elasticity values for use in future\nevaluations of possible fare changes. Although these are useful\nin identifying the relationships between the different variables\nand ridership, time series analysis depends heavily on the\nnature of the data used, the time horizon, and the specific\nmodel specification. For instance, two analyses of the same\nDART ridership period yielded quite different results. (A more\ncomplete discussion of the technical issues and problems\nassociated with regression techniques can be found in the\nAPTA report, Fare Elasticity and Its Application to\nForecasting Transit Demand; this study describes the\napplication of an advanced econometric model for developing\nfare elasticities.) The nature of the data available for each\nvariable to be included in the analysis is crucial. The case\nstudies have illustrated that the existing fare collection\ntechnology can impose significant constraints on the quality of\nridership data that can be reported (as was the case at MBTA),\nand data storage procedures also may limit the availability of\ncertain data (as at NJT, where historical data on the level of\nservice of different modes was found to be unavailable in the\n1990 fare study).\nAnother problem may involve identifying an appropriate\ndata series for a particular non-transit variable. For example,\ndifferent agencies in a region (e.g, metropolitan planning\norganization [MPO], transit agency, and city planning\ndepartment) often maintain their own data series, and these do\nnot always agree. This was the case for gas prices in Dallas--\ntwo different agencies had historical indexes that differed\nconsiderably for certain periods.\nEven when relevant data are available, there can be\ndifficulty establishing relationships that make intuitive sense.\nFor example, employment trends affect trip-making on all\nmodes of transportation and commuters are a major part of the\ntransit market; however, many agencies, among the case\nstudies and others, have been unable to demonstrate\nsignificant relationships between employment and demand.\nFor example, no employment series appeared to be a useful\nexplanatory variable in analyzing DART's ridership changes.\nThe available series was for Metropolitan Statistical Area\nemployment, which, during the period under consideration,\nwas increasing. Much of this increase, however, was thought\nto be in the suburban areas and, therefore, unconnected with\nDART ridership levels.\nRegression analysis has constraints associated with it--only\na few of which have been noted here. There are also concerns\nthat the effects isolated through these mechanisms are not\nuseful as indicators of the effects that would be experienced\nwith changes in fare levels or other factors in the future. (The\n\naccuracy of specific predictions is discussed in the individual\npredictive methods, including stated preference techniques or\ncase studies.) As mentioned under Development of Fare\nthe application of industry guidelines. Professional judgment\nElasticities, this has led analysts and planners to try alternative\nis a crucial aspect of any approach.\n\nCHAPTER 5\nFARE PAYMENT AND COLLECTION TECHNOLOGY OPTIONS\nINTRODUCTION\nThe final major parameter of the overall fare payment and\ncollection system is the fare collection and media distribution\ntechnology (used in this report to refer to the type of fare\npayment media and equipment used in these functions). The\ntechnology used in fare payment and collection affects the\nefficiency of these functions and the range of fare strategies\nand payment options that can be employed. Moreover,\nimproved technology can contribute to improvements in\nrevenue control, data collection, operations planning, and\nservice integration. Such improvements do not come without\ncertain costs (i.e., beyond the actual expense of procuring the\nequipment and producing the fare media); these costs may\ninclude training of operating and maintenance personnel,\neducation of riders, testing and installation of equipment, and\ndevelopment of new accounting and processing procedures.\nUnlike\nindustries\nsuch\nas\ntelecommunications\nand\ninformation systems, the transit industry traditionally has been\nslow\nto\nembrace\nadvanced\ntechnologies.\nBudgetary\nrestrictions place significant constraints on all transit capital\ninvestments, thereby discouraging experimentation. Most\ntransit agencies require that every new technology or piece of\nequipment be clearly demonstrated to be capable of holding up\nunder the often severe mechanical and electrical operating\nconditions present in the transit environment. Any new\ntechnology must, therefore, be well proven before it is\nembraced for widespread transit application. Table 40\nsummarizes the history of technological developments in the\nfare collection area.\nAgencies must understand both the benefits and the costs\nassociated with introducing new fare technology. Whereas the\nprevious chapters focused on fare policy and structure\ndecisions, the next several chapters address technology and\nequipment issues. This chapter identifies and describes the\ndifferent types of media and equipment used in the transit\nindustry. Chapter 6 discusses emerging fare payment\ntechnologies,\nparticularly\nelectronic\npayment\nmethods.\nChapter 7 examines applications of electronic payment and\ndevelopments related to the purchase and processing of fare\nmedia. Finally, Chapter 8 reviews the selection and\nprocurement of new fare technologies and equipment,\nincluding a discussion of the costs and benefits associated with\nthese technologies.\nTYPES OF FARE COLLECTION SYSTEMS\nGeneral Types of Fare Collection System\nThe four basic types of fare collection system are as\nfollows:\n- Pay on entry (i.e., on boarding the vehicle)--typically\ninvolves a farebox; the most common approach for buses;\n- Barrier (i.e., pay on entering or exiting a station or\nloading area)--involves turnstiles, gates, ticket agents, or\ncombinations thereof; may involve entry control only or\nentry and exit control; the most common approach for\nrapid rail;\n- POP--barrier-free; the most common approach for light\nrail; also used on commuter rail; and\n- Conductor-validated--used only on commuter rail.\nThe basic fare system elements (i.e., fare media and types of\nequipment) and their typical application are summarized in\nTable 41. Not every type of collection system is used with\nevery mode, and individual types of media are appropriate\nonly for certain collection system and mode combinations.\nTherefore, the type of collection system is generally the first\ndecision made in developing a new overall fare system. This\nmay, in turn, limit the selection of a media technology, or,\nconversely, the selection of a media technology may require\nthat the collection system choice be revisited.\nPay on entry is typically used on buses, although some bus\nsystems in Europe use POP systems. Rapid rail lines are\ntypically barrier (or gated) systems, although POP is used on\nsome systems; some barrier systems involve entry control\nonly, while others (e.g., distance-based magnetic ticket\nsystems) use entry and exit control. Most commuter rail\nservices have been conductor-validated systems, although the\nnewer lines have tended to adopt POP; there is a single barrier\ncommuter rail system (Metra Electric in Chicago). LIRR\nactually has implemented station designs that are unmanned\nbut open and close automatically. Appropriate closed-circuit\nTV and motion sensors are installed to monitor station\noccupancy, and warnings are provided at closing to provide\nsufficient time for passengers to vacate the station before the\nAVM security gate closes and the station doors are locked.\nLight rail lines have used pay on entry, barrier, and POP,\nalthough as with commuter rail, the trend in recent years has\nbeen to use POP. The different types of media and equipment\nused in these systems are described in the following sections.\nThe types of fare systems and technologies used for selected\nU.S. and Canadian transit agencies are summarized in Table\n42. The next section reviews fare system applications abroad;\nsome of these approaches are quite different from those in the\nUnited States and are thus of interest here.\nFare Collection Trends and Applications Abroad\nWith regard to type of fare collection system, one of the\nmajor differences between European transit systems and those\nin the United States is that most systems in Europe use the\n\nTABLE 40 Significant events in development of fare collection systems\nPOP concept--or \"open system\" as it is called there--for\nboth bus and rail systems. AVMs are used for rapid transit\nand light rail systems; AVMs, window sales, and conductor\nfare collection (with on-board penalty fare) are used for\ncommuter rail systems. Bus systems have validators at\nstops in some cities or, more frequently, inside the bus (at\nthe rear entrance). Cash fares (at a premium) are collected\nby the bus driver. Tickets are sold through outlets along the\nroutes. With the advent of systems based on personal\ncomputers (PCs), compact-disk--read-only-memory (CD\nROM), and miniaturization of electronics, compact self-\nservice fare and schedule information \"terminals\" are\nprovided in many railway stations and at airports. All fare\nand schedule information is available at the touch of a\nbutton; \"information pillars\" in Germany are an example.\nThese systems provide a choice of \"conversation\"\nlanguage; English, French, German, and Italian are the\nmain choices.\nIn the fare technology area, a key difference in the\nEuropean, Asian, and Australian systems is the greater use of\nelectronic fare payment in general, and smart cards in\nparticular. Some agencies, particularly in Europe, have\nimplemented various types of smart card tests and\napplications; several of these involve multiple use of cards\n(i.e., for purposes other than transit). The smart card\napplications are discussed in the next three chapters and in\nAppendix A. Examples of other types of applications for\nindividual countries and cities are summarized below. This list\nis not meant to be exhaustive but to highlight the range of\napproaches in place.\n\nTABLE 41 Fare system elements\n* for purchase of other media\n** Metra Electric only current barrier commuter rail system in U.S.\nFrance\nParis. In the Paris metropolitan region, more than 1,800\nnew AVMs have been introduced for passengers using mass\ntransit, commuter rail, and intercity trains. These AVMs use\ntouchscreen technology. Most AVMs accept coins and credit\nand ATM cards but not bills--France has high denomination\ncoins, as do most European countries. These AVMs are used\nto sell mass transit trip tickets and monthly passes. The second\ntype of use is for commuter rail lines and intercity tickets.\nThese are coin and card AVMs as above, although some\nAVMs accept only credit and ATM cards. The third type,\nwhich accepts only credit and ATM cards, is designed for\nmaking seat reservations and purchasing intercity tickets.\nThese AVMs are networked nationwide and their reservations\nsoftware uses American Airlines software.\nGermany\nKoln. Koln's KVV trams have AVMs installed at the rear\ndoor entrance area. These are coin accepting machines, some\nwith built-in validators and some with free-standing\nvalidators. Cash fare passengers pay a premium fare to the\ndriver. Zone changes are controlled remotely by the operator.\nSwitzerland\nSBB Railway. All Swissrail ticket offices are equipped with\nticket office machines (TOMs) connected to a train\ninformation network. When a ticket agent enters a rider's trip\nplan, a customized schedule is printed showing boarding\ntimes, connect times, fares, whether restaurant service is\navailable, and so forth. This system covers boats and trains\nand most regional PTT bus connections, i.e., the entire\nnational network.\nZurich. The Zurich region has a truly integrated system that\nincludes a multitude of transit services, all with POP fare\ncollection. Their 1,500 streetside AVMs are at all bus stops\nand at rail stations. Most AVMs are no more than 2 years old.\nThey accept coins and one denomination of bill (CHF20) and\ngive change. The passenger enters a 4-digit destination code\nthat represents the destination (zip) code. Stops are listed\nalphabetically with corresponding code. The ticket sales\nrecord from/to data (keyed to the zip code), which is used for\nrevenue allocation. AVMs have built-in validators, and, at\nselected stations and stops, free-standing validators are also\nprovided.\nSingapore\nThe Mass Rapid Transit in Singapore introduced a common\nstored value farecard recognized by Mass Rapid Transit,\nSingapore Bus Service (SBS), and Trans-Island Bus Services\n(TIBS). SBS and TIBS (2,500 buses altogether) are private\nsector operators, and Mass Rapid Transit is a subsidiary of a\nstate-owned holding company. The three operators established a\njointly owned company, TransitLink, to facilitate the operation.\nMass Rapid Transit started with a stored-value ticket and \"last\nride bonus\" feature, but this feature has been eliminated. The\nfarecards are not retained by the system when value is exhausted.\n\nTABLE 42 Types of fare structures and technologies for selected rail properties\n* to be installed\nLegend:\nAVM's Automated Vending Machines\nTOM's Ticket Office Machines\nLegend:\nNR = Not required\n\nInstead, passengers purchasing a farecard are required to pay a\ndeposit of S$2.00, which is then \"eaten into\" in order to permit\nthe completion of the journey. The passenger retains the\nfarecard but at next \"topping up,\" the \"deposit value\" is restored.\nFarecards are sold through AVMs and initial purchase or\nrevaluation can only be done by direct debit (ATM cards). A\nnationwide smart card system (CashCard) is being developed\nand will be introduced over the next 5 years; although this is\nprimarily a banking system, TransitLink is expected to seriously\nconsider using the CashCards for trains and buses.\nJapan\nTokyo. In Tokyo and elsewhere in the country there are two\ntypes of cards. Prepaid Cards are a substitute for coins and\n\nbills and cannot be used directly in the faregate. They can be\nused in a ticket vending machine (TVM) to purchase mass\ntransit tickets or for other commodities vended such as sodas\nand cigarettes. The second type is the Stored Value Ticket\n(SVT), which can be used directly in the faregates and also to\npurchase commodities. Almost all systems use plastic cards\nand tickets. Japan Railroad East in Tokyo is also testing\nvoiceactivated ticketing.\nSapporo. Gated systems such as in Sapporo and several\nother cities have open mode gates. The barrier is always open.\nThe passenger is required to insert a ticket in the transport as\nin the United States. If the ticket is valid, nothing happens and\nthe passenger enters. If the ticket is not valid, the barrier\ncloses. For trip tickets, the tickets can be inserted in any one of\nfour ways and still be read by the gate.\nAustralia\nAdelaide. Adelaide's State Transportation Authority (STA)\noperates buses, trams, and trains in its metropolitan region. All\ntickets are magnetically encoded. Tickets must be inserted in\nvalidators (fitted on all vehicles) on each boarding. Single-trip\nand day-trip (day pass) tickets are paper, and multi-trip (10\nride) tickets are produced on more durable material.\nNew South Wales. The CityRail division of the New South\nWales State Rail Authority (SRA) operates a statewide rail\nnetwork with (294 stations) emanating from Sydney. CityRail\npurchased new fare collection equipment in 1991. This system\nwill have more than 1,000 pieces of equipment: three types of\nAVMs, TOMs, faregates, and associated computer equipment.\nFaregates will be installed only at high-volume \"inner\" area\nstations. One of the three types of AVMs is the Authority To\nTravel Machine (ATTM), which is designed for low-volume\nstations that do not have conventional AVMs. This machine\nissues a non-magnetic ticket for minimum fare and provides\n\"proof of station of origin\" for the passenger. When more than\nminimum fare is needed, the conductor collects the fare\nincrement. The Authority to Travel ticket must be surrendered\nat the TOM at a destination station, and credit will be given\nfor purchase of a magnetically encoded ticket to use on the\nbuses. A return trip ticket can also be purchased from the\nTOM.\nMexico\nMonterrey. Sistena de Transporte Colectivo Metroney in\nMonterrey has an entry and exit controlled system with stored-\nvalue plastic tickets that recirculate. Equipment was provided\nby Cubic. The system was modelled after the Singapore\nsystem.\nSouth America\nMost of the fare collection systems operating in South\nAmerica are of French (CGA) design and are patterned after\nthe systems in France.\nTYPES OF FARE MEDIA\nThe basic types of fare media are as follows:\n- Cash,\n- Token,\n- Paper ticket,\n- Magnetic ticket,\n- Smart card,\n- Debit card,\n- Credit card, and\n- Transit voucher.\nThese media can be used to pay the fare directly or to\npurchase the actual payment medium. All of the above\nmedia--except perhaps paper tickets--can be used as a means\nof purchase, although cash, debit card, credit card, and transit\nvoucher (along with personal check in some places) are the\ntypical purchase media. This section focuses on the payment\nmedia, rather than those used primarily for purchase.\nCash. Cash is the oldest, most common means of paying for\ntransit rides. It is readily obtainable and requires no special\nsale or distribution arrangement. On the other hand, riders are\ninvariably required to use exact change; the level of\ninconvenience represented by this depends to a certain extent\non the fare level. Cash--particularly dollar bills--also\npresents difficulties to transit agencies. Bills are costly to\nprocess, and cash, in general, provides opportunities for theft\nby transit employees. The use of dollar bills also poses\nproblems on some bus systems, because older fareboxes have\ndifficulty accepting bills.\nIn response to the currency-related problems, a new dollar\ncoin has received considerable transit industry support in\nrecent years. Meanwhile, many agencies seek to minimize the\namount of cash they have to handle by promoting the use of\nprepaid fare options. The cashless system has great appeal\nthroughout the industry. Nevertheless, most operators--\nparticularly the small and medium bus systems--recognize\nthat it will be difficult to eliminate the use of cash in their\nsystems completely.\nTokens. Tokens, which have been used by transit agencies\nfor several decades, are relatively easy for passengers to buy\nand use and are easily handled by existing money room\nequipment. Drawbacks to their use include the facts that they\ncan be 1) easily counterfeited and 2) hoarded by riders seeking\nto avoid having to pay future fare increases. Partly for the\nlatter reason, tokens offer an agency limited flexibility in\nchanging their fare structures. Tokens are also limited as to the\nrange of fare options in which they can be packaged. They can\nbe sold in bulk (e.g., in \"10-packs\") for convenience or to\nprovide a discount but cannot be used for other options. The\nmajor cost to the transit agency is in acquiring, distributing,\nand recirculating the supply of tokens. Despite their\ndisadvantages, tokens continue to be used by some agencies,\nincluding the largest and oldest rail systems (e.g., MTA\nNYCT, CTA, MBTA, SEPTA, and MARTA).\n\nPaper Tickets. All fare payment media other than cash and\ntokens are some form of ticket or card. Tickets and cards\neither contain printed information only or include stored\ninformation as well; the former category is referred to here as\npaper tickets, while the latter can be either magnetic-stripe\ntickets or smart cards. Paper (i.e., non-magnetic) tickets are\nwidely used in the transit industry, particularly in POP\nsystems. These tickets can be used for single-rides or multi-\nrides (a single multi-ride ticket or a \"book\" of tickets); in\naddition, flash passes can be in the form of paper tickets.\nMulti-ride tickets and passes sold through outlets usually do\nnot require validation at the point of sale. Tickets requiring\nvalidation at the time of purchase are generally those sold\nthrough machines such as AVMs and TOMs. Printing done by\nmachines in such cases has to be coordinated with the\npreprinted ticket stock to maintain proper printing registration.\nSystems that use validators cancel a ticket by physically\naltering the ticket by either clipping a portion of a multi-ride\nticket and printing date, time, and location code, or by only\nprinting the information. The validators can sense previous\ncancellations and clip or print accordingly. Where validators\nare not used, the easy visual verification of a valid ticket is an\nimportant aspect of ticket design. The ticket must be able to be\nverified quickly by on-board conductors and fare inspectors.\nThus, the graphics must be clear, with valid dates and\nrestrictions presented in a quickly readable form.\nMagnetic Tickets. Magnetic-stripe tickets can be used for\nany type of payment option: single-ride, multi-ride, period\npass, or stored value. They offer extensive flexibility to both\nthe operator and the rider. Magnetic tickets are used mostly in\nsystems that have gates and turnstiles to control access, egress,\nor both; however, they can be used in bus systems that have\nticket readers and processing units attached to their fareboxes.\nThe tickets can be used with different types of readers: read-\nwrite-print, read-write, and read-only swipe readers or\ntransport units. Magnetic tickets can be pre-encoded by high-\nspeed ticket encoders and distributed for sale by retail outlets\nor can be dispensed from AVMs and ticket office machines\n(TOMs). High-speed encoders are used by BART, for\ninstance, to encode high-value and concession-fare tickets.\nMBTA contracts for service to encode a variety of monthly\npasses. Magnetic tickets--and indeed all electronic media--\noffer several primary advantages over printed (paper) tickets\nand tokens. They offer convenience and (presumably) ease of\nuse to the rider. They allow for a higher degree of revenue\ncontrol by a transit agency and can generate a considerable\namount of data on ridership patterns. Perhaps more\nimportantly, though, they give the agency tremendous\nflexibility in establishing fare options and levels. Furthermore,\nthey facilitate regional integration, in terms of allowing\nmultiple operators to use a single ticket while retaining their\nindividual fare structures; examples of such efforts can be seen\nin the San Francisco and Los Angeles areas. The major\ndrawback to the use of magnetic tickets is the cost of\npurchasing the necessary equipment (i.e., for electronic fare\ncollection); the cost of equipping rail stations in particular can\nbe very high. Magnetic-stripe technology is discussed further\nin the next three chapters. The benefits and emerging\napplications are addressed in Chapters 7 and 8; cost issues are\ndiscussed in Chapter 8.\nSmart Cards. Smart cards are an emerging technology in\ntransit fare payment. The smart card is technically an\nintegrated circuit card that contains a microprocessor (i.e., a\ncomputer chip) and has built-in logic. The term also has been\nused to describe generally a range of automated types of card\ntechnologies, including integrated circuit memory cards\nwithout microprocessors and radio frequency identification\ncards and tags, also often without microprocessors. All types\nof smart cards can store large amounts of data, which can be\naltered and updated in accordance with the logic built or\nprogrammed in; other features and the different types of cards\nare described in the next chapter.\nAn advantage of smart cards is that they offer a greater\nmeasure of security than magnetic-stripe cards and, in fact,\ncan be used as a security access instrument as well as an\ninstrument for stored value. Smart cards also can maintain\ndifferent accounts within their memory for different clients or\nagencies. In addition, the \"contactless\" smart card offers the\nadvantage of not having to be inserted into--or swiped\nthrough--a reader; rather, the card only has to be placed close\nto the reader for a transaction to be processed, i.e., there is no\nactual contact between the card and the fare collection\nequipment. This results in less wear on the equipment; such a\ncard is also easier to use by transit riders who might have\ndifficulty using a more conventional fare medium (i.e.,\nbecause of a disability). Currently, the major drawback to the\nwidespread use of smart cards in transit applications--besides\nthe lack of in-service testing--is the high unit cost of the card\nitself. Depending on the exact type and capabilities of the card,\nsmart cards cost anywhere from $3.00 to $10.00 each--\nconsiderably more than the $0.10 to $0.60 unit cost of a\nmagnetic ticket. As their use expands in other areas (e.g.,\nbanking and telephone usage), the production cost should drop\nsomewhat. Moreover, the longer life of a smart card suggests\nthat it should have a life cycle cost advantage over less durable\nfare media. Cost issues are discussed in Chapters 6 and 8.\nSmart cards have seen growing use in a range of\napplications, particularly banking, health care, and telephone\nusage. Although the United States has been slow to adopt this\ntechnology, the use of smart cards is flourishing in Europe,\nwhere they have been in existence for more than 10 years,\nwith France leading the way. Only in the last few years,\nhowever, has the smart card technology been applied to public\ntransportation. There are some applications around the world\n(discussed in the next chapter), and the technology is\nbeginning to be tested in several U.S. cities.\nOther Media. The preceding sections discuss the range of\npayment media that have been used to any wide extent in the\ntransit environment to date. Other advanced media developed\nfor use in other industries are sometimes suggested for\nconsideration as transit payment media.\nThree such\ntechnologies are as follows.\n\nBar code cards have been used in a public transportation\napplication, by the Netherlands Railways, for verification\npurposes. Student passes include a bar code and are verified\nby inspectors, using hand-held bar code readers. This\nequipment has helped reduce pass misuse. There could be use\nof bar code cards in fare-payment-related applications in the\ncoming years; a federally sponsored study of potential transit\napplications in the United States is being conducted.\n(Additional details on the Netherlands project are presented in\nAppendix B.)\nOptical (laser) storage cards are best suited for storing large\namounts of data write-once-read-many format. Data are stored\nusing digital and optical techniques. A credit-card-size card\ncan provide storage capacity of up to 4 megabytes (i.e., 1,600\ntypewritten pages of text). Typical uses being tested include\nmilitary dog tags and storage of field-repair manuals;\nhowever, the greatest potential application may be for storage\nof personal medical records. Currently, there does not appear\nto be any practical transit application for this technology.\n(Additional details on this technology are presented in\nAppendix B.)\nHolographic cards are manufactured by a process which\nembosses a distinct pattern (hologram) onto the card by laser-\ndriven optical methods. When used for machine verification,\nthe card is inserted in a reader. An infrared beam checks the\nauthenticity of the card used. Current applications include use\nas stored value cards for British Telecom's and Swiss PTT's\n\"Phonecard.\" When the card is used, it is temporarily held by\nthe reader unit. Depending on the units used (e.g., length of\ntelephone call), the appropriate value is thermally erased from\nthe hologram. The concept is, therefore, essentially a stored\nvalue method. This technology is more secure than magnetic\ntickets but less flexible and very capital-intensive. The use of\nthese cards for transit does not appear to be imminent.\nTYPES OF EQUIPMENT\nThis section summarizes the key characteristics of the major\ntypes of equipment used in fare collection and distribution\nsystems. Current technology is described and new or\ndeveloping technologies are identified.\nThe major pieces of equipment found in a fare collection or\ndistribution system are as follows:\n- AVMs,\n- TOMs,\n- Turnstiles,\n- Fareboxes,\n- Validators,\n- Hand-held devices,\n- Ticket processing units (TPUs), and\n- Other equipment (e.g., central computers and addfare\nmachines).\nThese pieces of equipment are described below.\nAVMs and ATMs\nPassenger-operated AVMs (also often called TVMs) can be\nfurnished with various features. Depending on the number of\nfeatures to be provided, the complexity of AVMs can vary\nfrom issuing a single ticket type with exact fare to those that\nsell a variety of types and accept various payment means (see\nTable 43). The number of ticket types sold, the number of\nbutton selections needed, the method of fare payment, the\nchange giving technique, and passenger interface requirements\nare the key elements that affect the cost of AVMs. The options\nare many and varied. Representative forms of AVM operating\nfunctions are as follows:\n- Exact fare: 1) accept coins only or bills and coins; 2)\naccept credit and debit (ATM) cards;\n- Fare acceptance with change giving: accept coins and/or\nbills; give change in coins;\n- Cards/no cash: accept only credit and debit cards--no\ncash; and\n- Ticket issue: 1) print tickets on paper stock (primarily roll\nfeed and guillotined ticket); 2) magnetically encode and\nprint tickets (primarily roll feed and guillotined ticket); 3)\nencode and issue tickets from stack feed; or 4) dispense\npre-encoded tickets from stack feed.\nOlder machines selling only one or two ticket types and\naccepting only coins represent the simplest AVMs, as at\nPATCO. These machines dispense pre-encoded plastic\ntickets from a stacker. Newer machines, such as at LIRR are\nmore complex, with three forms of fare payment: coins and\nbills, credit card, and debit card. Recirculating change is\nprovided and the AVM issues over 100 ticket types using\nmultiple ticket stock rolls. AVMs also vend tokens.\nMachines that do not accept any cash but accept credit and\ndebit cards have been recently introduced by Virginia Rail\nExpress (VRE). With higher fares and no dollar coin in\ngeneral circulation in the United States, most AVMs already\naccept bills. Credit and debit card acceptance, especially for\npurchase of multi-ride, pass media, or both, has seen\nincreased use in recent years. Finally, the ability to enable\nmultiple agency services to be used with a single ticket has\nrequired increasing the use of stored-value tickets. This\ncreates a need for the AVM to have the capability to read the\nvalue left and add value to it in a similar manner to\nWMATA's ExitFare machines.\nAVMs have been designed with a wide variety of graphics\nand passenger interface characteristics. The range of features\nincludes pushbuttons and light-emitting-diode (LED) displays;\npushbuttons and cathode ray tube; and, more recently, the \"soft\"\nbuttons associated with touchscreen technology as provided by\nAgent Systems' AVMs at LIRR. The use of different audible\ntones for different functions is especially helpful to those with\nvisual disabilities. VRE, for example, recently introduced\nAVMs that can \"talk\" and can, thus, guide those with visual\ndisabilities through the procedure; this is in addition to Braille\ninstructions on the panel. The use of color graphics is also\nincreasing in AVMs, and CD-ROM and similar large and\ncheap non-volatile memory storage devices are being used to\ngive passengers information on fares and schedules. Germany,\nfor example, has introduced \"Information Pillars\" in several\nmajor railway stations. These devices have a color screen\n\nTABLE 43 AVM use by selected properties\nM = Magnetic\nP = Paper\nNotes:\n(1)\nThis applies to a small order of new equipment only.\n(2)\nIntroduced a few touchscreen and \"cashless\" AVM's, then phased in full-service AVM's by Agent Systems\n(3)\nFirst AFC system in U.S.\n(4)\nNJT's new AVM's must vend PATH magnetic tickets.\n(5)\nColor CRT for passenger display. Hi-Co magnetic tickets.\n(6)\nStacker fed, pre-encoded tickets in AVM's\ndriven by a PC- and CD-ROM-based system. There is one\nmenu \"selection\" device (pointer) and one button to get a hard\ncopy. The user can get all fare and schedule information on\ntrips between any two points in the German railway system.\nThe screen converses in three languages--English, French,\nand German.\nATMs used for banking also provide a readily usable\nnetwork of machines that can serve as point-of-sale units. As\ndescribed in Chapter 7, Seattle Metro sells monthly passes\nthrough ATMs. WMATA and Portland TRI-MET at one point\nsold fare media through ATMs as well; these two programs\nwere discontinued when the participating banks were\npurchased by other banks. In Seattle, as the month progresses,\nthe purchase price of the pass is prorated; this provides a\nmethod for relieving monthly sales peaks. The ATM industry\nhas become extremely competitive and is getting more market-\nminded and comfortable about testing ATM technology for a\nvariety of uses. Some of the new sales and marketing\ntechniques could have merit for transit use.\nAVMs that use the electronic funds transfer (EFT) method\nfor fare payments are generally linked to a local network\ncontroller at the agency. The controller, in turn, is linked to a\nservice bureau, which authorizes and stores all payment\ntransactions. All sales require a positive authorization from the\nclearinghouse. At NJT, this system is part of a larger network\nthat includes TOM sales. Implementation of credit and debit\ncard fare sales has been expanding as noted below:\n- 1986--LIRR introduced credit card AVMs,\n- 1987--NJT introduced credit card AVMs,\n- 1991--LIRR introduced debit and ATM card AVMs,\n- 1992--Metro-North introduced debit and ATM card\nAVMs,\n- 1992--VRE introduced AVMs that accept only credit and\ndebit cards, and\n- 1993--SCRRA introduced credit card and ATM card\nAVMs.\nThe use of ATMs and EFT in the transit industry is\ndiscussed in Chapter 7.\nValidators\nValidation is the process of canceling a ticket by the\npassenger prior to the journey. This can be done manually or\n\nautomatically. Manual validation can be as simple as\npurchasing a day pass from an outlet and scratching off boxes\nreserved for the month and day of the month. The day pass is\nonly valid for the day scratched off.\nAutomated validation can be accomplished in two ways--\ntickets purchased from ticket agents or AVMs can be inserted\nin the validator to cancel a ticket prior to the journey, or the\nAVM or the ticket agent's TOM can print the date, or date and\ntime, on the ticket at the time of purchase. The \"canceled\"\nticket can be presented to the on-board crew as proof of\npayment of fare for that trip. Validators are also called\nCancellors by some agencies.\nValidators are compact (approximately 10 by 4 by 8 in.) and\ncan be readily installed in convenient locations within stations,\non platforms, or on vehicles. Passengers can insert their tickets\ninto a slot to validate a trip prior to boarding. Reciprocating-\ntype validators transport the ticket into the unit, process the\nticket by printing or altering the magnetic code or both and\nthen returning the ticket appropriately validated. This\ntechnique is generally used for magnetic tickets. Certain types\nof validators (i.e., read-write-print) can print value or trips\nremaining on stored value or multi-ride tickets after deduction\nof the appropriate fare for a trip. An alternative to the\ntransport-type validator is a swipe-through reader. In this\nformat, the passenger \"swipes\" the magnetic-stripe ticket or\npass through a slot, and the reader verifies that the ticket is\nvalid. Swipe readers can be mounted on fareboxes or on\nturnstiles. Paper and printed ticket validators generally do not\nhave a ticket transport. The insertion of the ticket is detected,\nand a trip is deducted by clipping a portion of the side of the\nticket and printing the date, time, and location code to show a\ncanceled trip. Optical sensing is available to determine where\nthe validator should print the next cancellation.\nValidators can also be provided with passenger selection\nbuttons--to select one of several destinations. Displays can be\nprovided to indicate selections and to provide instructions.\nValidators for rail use are usually self-contained units with\nmicroprocessor-based electronics, registers, ticket transport (if\nneeded), displays, buttons, and power supply. Data can be\nstored locally in electronic registers or stored in a data module\nthat can then be processed at a central location. Validators can\nalso be mounted on top of electrically released turnstiles to\nprovide an economical access control method.\nValidators are used in several POP systems, where the\nburden of purchase of a validated ticket or validation of a\npreviously purchased ticket is placed on the passenger. Some\nsystems have stand-alone validators; others have them\nincorporated in the AVM cabinet. Such validators can also be\nused as ticket readers when used in the read-only mode for\nmagnetic ticket systems. For example, multi-ride tickets can\nbe inserted to read trips remaining or stored value tickets\ninserted to read amount remaining.\nTPUs (or bus ticket validators) are recently developed\nattachments for fareboxes. TPUs can issue paper transfers or\nissue and accept magnetically encoded tickets. The TPU is\ncontrolled by the keypad on the farebox. Some functions can\nbe automatic. For example, if a passenger deposits the base\nfare and the transfer charge, a transfer can be automatically\nproduced by the TPU. Pre-encoded tickets from either an AVM\nor another TPU can be processed by the TPU and have a ride or\nvalue deducted. The remaining value can be printed on the\nticket either after each deduction or after a set number has been\nreached such as one twentieth of the original value. This\ntechnique \"saves\" print lines and reduces or eliminates ticket\nreplacement on a vehicle. A passenger display provides a\nreadout of the rides or value remaining at each use of the ticket.\nTransaction records for all tickets and transfers processed by the\nTPU are recorded in the farebox memory. Upon probing (data\nextraction from the farebox) all records from the TPU and\ntransactions from the farebox are extracted for further\nprocessing by the local and/or central computers of the agency.\nTOMs\nTOMs are automated ticket dispensers, operated by ticket\nagents. TOMs are compact--several manufacturers make units\nthat are smaller than a desktop computer. A TOM consists of a\nkeypad for entry of certain alphanumeric values (such as\nstation origin-destination codes and passenger category) and\ntypically some function codes associated with the ticket issue\nprocess. Generally, a few buttons are reserved for the most\ncommonly requested destinations. Associated with the keypad\nis a display unit to show amount due to the station agent and to\nthe passenger. A printer unit makes up the third major module.\nMultiple printers are provided in some cases to issue tickets\nfrom different rolls or from rolls of different widths. TOMs\ncan be programmed to accommodate hundreds of ticket types\non the basis of origin-destination combination, category of\npassenger, and ticket type. Fares can be programmed into the\nTOM by solid state data modules, or telephone lines can be\nused for downloading fares and uploading statistical data.\nIn a POP system, a TOM must sell advance purchase tickets\nthat then require subsequent validation by the passenger in a\nvalidator. The TOMs also need to issue a ticket with date and\ntime printed thereon for immediate use of the ticket. Another\nimportant consideration is that issued tickets must be of a size\nand material suitable for subsequent insertion into a validator.\nTOMs can be equipped with magnetic ticket readers that\nprovide many benefits. A ticket reader provides means for the\nstation agent to sign on. The reader can also read several data\nitems and verify authenticity of the user. In systems in which\nmagnetic tickets are used, the reader can assist in decoding\nmalfunctioning tickets. In systems in which credit cards are\nused for fare purchase, credit verification can be included in\nthe TOM. TOMs provide the following advantages over\nmanual pre-printed ticket selling methods (i.e., for commuter\nrail applications):\n- Prints (and encodes, if applicable) tickets only when\nneeded, and provides greater flexibility in issuing many\nvaried ticket types;\n- Improves accountability by providing means to audit data\nat various levels of detail for each agent's tour of duty;\nalso eliminates the need for agent-to-agent revenue\nreconciliation; and\n\n- Automates data collection and reporting to tie revenue\ncollection data to ticket issue data.\nTOMs with communication (modem) links can be used at\nhigh volume outlets as point-of-sale terminals. Key\ntechnological advances have been in the areas of printer\ntechnology and capabilities for use of magnetic cards.\nFareboxes\nFareboxes are used on buses and on some light rail vehicles.\nElectronic registering fareboxes (ERFs) allow automatic\nregistration of coins, tokens, bills, and tickets, as well as\nrecording of trip-related data such as zone fare, type of\nservice, and category of passenger. The revenue and data\ncollected and transferred to money rooms' systems can be\ntracked electronically with cashbox ID and vault ID systems.\nERFs are also beginning to be configured with swipe readers,\nTPUs, or both.\nRecent developments related to ERFs include the\nintroduction of a transactional database capability so that each\nfare payment can be recorded as a unique event within the\nassociated \"fields\" for each trip. This allows the generation of\nmuch more meaningful statistics by using a relational database\nat the central computer level that can enable individual tickets\nor boardings to be tracked. This basic approach can be used in\nemployer billing programs, in which individual employers can\nbe billed for trips made by their employees. Phoenix Transit\nhas such a program; a magnetic swipe reader is used with a\npass for employees of participating employers. Similar\nprograms are being considered by several agencies, including\nthose in Seattle, Washington; Santa Cruz, California; and\nClearwater, Florida. Credit cards can also be used in the swipe\nreaders in Phoenix.\nIt is envisioned that the next major farebox-related\ndevelopment will involve the integration of the farebox\nelectronics with a central on-board \"blackbox\" for data\ntransfer. As part of the development of \"smart bus standards,\"\na group consisting of transit agency and manufacturing\npersonnel is developing practices and open standards for\ninterfacing the various interchangeable transit vehicle devices\nand systems while permitting proprietary consideration. These\ndevices are items such as the following:\n- Automatic vehicle location devices,\n- Fareboxes and TPUs,\n- Passenger signs,\n- Passenger counters, and\n- Radios.\nWith a common standard it is expected that the vehicle\nwould be equipped with a single cable to a \"blackbox\" to\nwhich all manufacturers would connect their devices. This will\neliminate duplication of procedures (such as multiple sign\nons) required to be performed by the drivers, reduce the\nhardware clutter, and provide a means to access various data\nbases (e.g., the odometer reading and fares collected would be\nused to compute revenue per mile).\nTurnstiles\nTurnstiles (or faregates) are used for access and egress\ncontrol in a barrier or closed fare collection system. The\nturnstile, which consists of the ticket reader or coin or token\nacceptor, as well as the actual barrier device, can be used for\nentry control, exit control, or both. Turnstiles can be used in\nthe freewheeling mode in either or both directions and can\nautomatically count entries and exits. Turnstiles operate in\neither a ticket transport or swipe mode, as discussed under\nmagnetic stripe tickets, above. All ticket-transport-operated\nturnstiles in the United States use magnetic ticket technology\nand credit-card-size tickets--with the exception of Baltimore's\nMTA, which has Edmondson size (30 mm by 55 mm) tickets.\nTypically, the operation of an access and egress control\nturnstile system requires the ticket to be inserted into a slot. The\nticket is transported over a magnetic-read head that reads the\npreviously encoded data. Depending on the type of ticket and\nconditions of use programmed in the turnstile's microprocessor-\nbased logic, the ticket data are appropriately altered and written\non the ticket by the write head. Depending on the rides or\nvalue remaining, the ticket is returned or captured. Passes are\nalways returned. When a ticket is processed, the barrier\n(usually a tripod) is released to permit entry. When the ticket\nis captured, it is retained within the turnstile.\nPrinting on the ticket in the turnstiles is a feature that is\nprovided in some systems. For instance, 10-ride tickets can be\nprinted to indicate the number of rides left. An alternative\nconcept is to display to the passenger the number of rides left\nor the value remaining on an LED or similar display on the\nturnstile console. This approach has been used at PATCO and\nMetra, where remaining rides are displayed. In Hong Kong\nMTR and Singapore MRT the value left is displayed. This\napproach will also be used by MTA-NYCT and CTA.\nAll data pertaining to ticket type used, number of entries\nand exits by time period, access to servicing of turnstiles, and\nso forth are stored within the turnstile's electronic memory.\nThese data can be shown by a visual readout at the turnstile,\ncaptured in a portable data unit, or by polling by a station\ncontroller (PC or equivalent). Data can then be transmitted to a\ncentral controller. Remote on and off and freewheel\ncommands can also be issued from a central controller.\nHand-Held Devices\nHand-held\ndata\ndevices\nhave\nseen\na\ntremendous\napplications growth--especially because of miniaturization,\navailability of large amounts of memory in small chips, and\nportable modems on a card. Two types of hand-held devices\nare used in connection with transit fare collection functions:\nhand-held ticketing devices (HHTDs) and cellular telephones.\nHHTDs allow on-board validation and sale of tickets by\nroving fare inspectors. They are used to validate (time-stamp)\nprepurchased tickets and to sell tickets to riders boarding\nwithout tickets. HHTDs, especially for commuter rail and POP\nsystems, show promise as the weight and the size of the units\ndecreases because of significant reduction in the sizes of the\nelectronic components and the advancements in battery life.\n\nThe recent expansion of the cellular telephone network and\nthe proliferation of telephones and related devices has created\nopportunities for almost immediate data collection and\nmonitoring of remote sites. For example, a portable computer\ncan be outfitted with a farebox probe and a cellular phone and\nused to collect farebox data from remote sites. Providing\nportable cellular phones to station agents for opening day\nenabled SCRRA personnel to estimate crowd size, give\naccurate passenger information, assist with security, and call\nfor aid in case of an emergency. Developments in portable\ndata collection devices have reduced the size of an HHTD to\nthat of a large, hand-held calculator. Some units have a built-in\nacoustic coupler for data transmission over a dial-up telephone\nline. A radio frequency device to access the cellular network\ncould be substituted. A future application could be a device\nproviding a keypad, display, and printer to a fare inspector.\nThis device would allow the inspector to query a data base to\nverify information presented by a rider being challenged\nand/or to determine the rider's past violation history."

Collins, Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe LLP, San Francisco, California\nI--INTRODUCTION\nFor over a decade, transit agencies across the United\nStates have been faced with the challenge of finding or\nmaintaining revenues with which to meet their growing\nbudgets for operations and capital costs relating to\nproviding transit services to their constituents. In California\nalone, the Californians for Better Transportation estimates\nthat the unfunded annual needs of public transit total over\nhalf a billion dollars. The traditional sources of funding for\ntransit providers have been state and federal grants and fare\nbox revenues, but due to budget restraints, both federal and\nstate governments have been reluctant to continue the level\nof subsidies for transit that have been pervasive in the past.\nRecognizing this, the federal government has been\nencouraging new sources of revenue and innovative\napplications of existing revenues to support transit services.\nThe Intermodal Service Transportation Efficiency Act of\n1991 (ISTEA) encouraged revenue enhancement and more\nefficient management of public transit infrastructure\nthrough the creation of public/private partnerships.\nOn May 9, 1995, the Federal Transit Administration\n(FTA) published a notice regarding its innovative financing\ninitiative in the Federal Register (60 Fed. Reg. 24682), in\nwhich FTA described innovative financing methods and\nasset management tools that may be used in connection\nwith projects receiving assistance from the FTA in order to\nfacilitate financing; leverage federal, state, and local funds;\nand otherwise increase the effectiveness of transit capital\nprojects.\nUsing the FTA notice as a guide to the types of\ninnovative financing methods in use, we conducted a\nsurvey to gather case studies of such techniques in\noperation. In March 1996 a questionnaire was mailed to\n400 transit providers requesting them to identify innovative\nfinancing techniques they had used. Responses were\nreceived from 97 transit agencies, although many of those\nresponding simply requested copies of the finished report.\nAfter reviewing the results of the survey, we contacted\nvarious transit agencies to attempt to determine appropriate\ncase studies. For each financing technique we identified at\nleast one or two agencies from which we could obtain the\nnecessary information for a study. In discussions with\nagencies we sometimes identified appropriate case studies\nthat were not initially identified in the survey response,\nsuch as examples of joint development.\nThis report describes the identified techniques that\nhave been successfully employed or attempted by transit\noperators in order to increase revenues available for transit\ncapital or operating needs or to provide development of\ntransit assets in innovative ways. Learning by example is\noften the easiest way to learn and by\nstudying the case studies set forth in this report, transit\noperators across the country can duplicate these techniques\nor expand on them with their own innovative financing\ntechniques to produce revenues or transit assets for the\ncommuting public.\nCertain legal issues are raised with respect to any\ninnovative financing technique that is employed. First, one\nhas to examine any federal regulations or issues that are\nraised by using federally-funded assets in an innovative\nfinancing technique. FTA's policy of encouraging financing\ninnovations has not necessarily trickled down to the\nregulations governing the use of federallyfunded assets.\nAmendments to regulations or special consents are often\nrequired. State laws must also be examined to determine\nwhether the innovative financing technique runs afoul of\nstate law prohibitions. Where there are public/private\npartnerships or the use of public assets by private entities,\nstate laws may restrict such participation by private firms.\nFinally, federal tax law issues may be raised if tax-exempt\nfinancing has been involved in any of the assets under\nconsideration for the financing technique. Tax-exempt\nfinancing also places limits on the private use of projects\nfunded with tax-exempt funds. This report describes case\nstudies where financings have been undertaken.\nThe case studies that we present here involve the\nfollowing areas:\n1. Certificates of participation or lease financing of transit\nassets,\n2. Joint development,\n3. Cross-border leasing,\n4. U.S. leverage leases,\n5. Fare box revenue bonds, and\n6. State revolving loan funds.\nAppendix A to this report contains addresses for the\npublic entities involved in the case studies and identifies\nthe counsel or other officer of the transit agencies familiar\nwith the financing studied.\nII--CERTIFICATES OF PARTICIPATION\nINVOLVING FTA 49 U.S.C. § 5307 (\"SECTION 9\")\nFUNDS\nIntroduction\nOne promising innovative financing technique for\ntransit projects is the use of FTA Section 9 funds to\nsubsidize principal and interest payments with respect to\nCertificates of Participation (COPs).1 This chapter\n1 On July 5, 1994, Public Law No 103-272 passed and\ncodified federal transit laws under Chapter 53 of the United States\nCode. The law repealed the Federal Transit Act without\nsubstantive change. The original meanings of the Federal Transit\nAct provisions are unchanged even though the new language in\nsome instances differs from that of the original\n\n______________________________________________________\n_____________________________________\nwill include a general discussion of COPs and the use of\nFTA Section 9 funds to help finance the acquisition of\ntransit-related capital projects through the sale of COPs\nThe Structure of a Certificates of Participation\nTransaction\nCOPs are securities that represent interests in a stream\nof payments from an underlying obligation, typically a\nlease or an installment sale agreement. The governmental\nentity's payments pursuant to this underlying obligation are\nassigned to a trustee who pays such moneys to the holders\nof the COPs. For transit finance purposes, this underlying\nobligation is usually a lease, since FTA Section 9 funds are\navailable to pay a portion of such lease payments, as\ndiscussed below.\nCOPs in lease payments are a mechanism for\ngovernmental entities to finance capital projects without\ntechnically issuing long-term debt. The issuance of long-\nterm debt is commonly subject to voter approval and other\nState constitutional and statutory requirements. Case law in\nvarious jurisdictions supports the proposition that leases do\nnot constitute \"debt\" for these purposes because the\ngovernmental lessee is not obligated at the outset to make\nrental payments throughout the entire term of the lease, but\nis only required to pay rent each year to the extent the\nleased property is available for use during such year.2\nIn a typical COPs financing:\n- An item of real or personal property with adequate\nannual fair rental value and useful life is identified as the\nasset to be subject to the Financing Lease. Such leased\nasset may be the property to be acquired or constructed\nwith the proceeds of the COPs, in which case interest with\nrespect to the COPs will need to be capitalized until the\nacquisition or construction of the property is complete.\nAlternatively, in an \"asset transfer\" or \"asset strip\"\nstructure, such leased asset may be a preexisting item of\nproperty, which obviates the need for capitalized interest\n- The identified item of property is leased to a second\nparty (often for nominal consideration), which becomes the\nlessor entity under the Financing Lease.\n-\nThe property is then leased back to the\ngovernmental entity pursuant to a Financing Lease for rent\nthat approximates the fair rental value of the property.\nThese rent payments have designated principal and interest\ncomponents that equal the principal and interest\nrepresented by the COPs. In addition to specifying the\nrental obligation, the Financing Lease typically calls for\nabatement of rent if the leased asset is damaged, destroyed,\ntaken by eminent domain, or (for real property) subject to\ntitle defect. The Financing Lease also includes covenants to\nmaintain insurance and\nAct Section 5307 of Title 49 of the U S C replaced Section 9 of the\nFederal Transit Act, but the funds are still called \"Section 9\" funds\nin common parlance and are so called in this report.\n2 See Rider v City of San Diego, 18 Cal. 4th 1035, 959 P 2d\n347 (Cal 1998)\nspecifies remedies for the failure to make rent payments.\nThe right to receive rent payments and to exercise remedies\nunder the Financing Lease is typically assigned to a trustee\nacting on behalf of the holders of the COPs.\n- COPs are sold as securities to investors in both\nprivate placements and public offerings. The credit strength\nof COPs may be enhanced with bond insurance, letters of\ncredit, or other guarantees. Because of the risks of\nabatement and nonappropriation of lease payments, an\nissuer's COPs are generally considered less creditworthy\nthan its general obligation debt.\nFTA Section 9 Funding\nThe link between FTA Section 9 funding and\npayments on COPs begins with Section 308 of the Surface\nTransportation and Uniform Relocation Assistance Act of\n1987 (STURRA).3 Section 308 authorized the use of\nSection 9 federal transit funds for leases of facilities and\nequipment at the 80 percent matching level in projects\nwhere leasing is determined to be more cost effective than\npurchase or direct construction. Previously, the interest\nportion of lease payments was treated as an operating\nexpense and eligible for reimbursement at only a 50 percent\nmatching ratio.\nThe FTA issued a Final Rule on Capital Leases to\nclarify the application of Section 308 on October 15, 1991.4\nThe primary change reflected in the FTA's 1991 Capital\nLeasing guidelines is the ability to treat lease payments,\nincluding interest costs, as capital expenses eligible for\nreimbursement at the full, 80 percent federal matching\nlevel. Since COPs represent an interest in a stream of\npayments, including lease payments, the new FTA policy\ncreated a clear opportunity for transit agencies to use\nfederal moneys in support of long-term financings.\nThe FTA's guidelines allow any asset eligible as a\ncapital item to be leased. Moreover, the Department of\nTransportation's comments accompanying the rules state\nthat the Senate Report language for Section 308 of\nSTURRA envisioned application of federal transit leasing\nfor such items as \"computers, maintenance of way and\nother heavy equipment, maintenance of effort rail\nequipment, radio equipment, bus garages, property or\nstructures for park and ride, and other buildings or facilities\nused for mass transit purposes.\"5 Despite the variety of\nassets that may be leased, the typical FTA Section 9\nsupported COP has involved the acquisition of buses. The\nuse of this financing mechanism versus a pay-as-you-go\npolicy allows transit agencies (either separately or in a\npooled transaction) to make larger purchases of bus assets\nsooner, thereby enhancing service.\nSince FTA Section 9 funding is subject to\ncongressional appropriation each year, there is no guarantee\n3 Pub L No. 100-17 § 308 (April 2, 1987) 101 Stat 226.\n4 49 C F R Part 639.\n5 See 56 Fed Reg. 51786 (Oct 15, 1991)\n\n_____________________________________\nthat sufficient funds will always be available to pay the full\n80 percent match of lease payments. Thus, rating agencies\nand capital market participants do not treat Section 9 funds\nas a guarantee, and the focus of any credit analysis is still\non nonfederal revenues.6 Moreover, the FTA's capital\nleasing guidelines impose a financial capacity test that\nrequires that the lessee transit agency certify that it has the\nability to meet future lease obligations in the absence of\nfederal funding.\nThe FTA also requires that a determination of cost\neffectiveness be made in order to justify a lease structure\ninstead\nof\na\ntraditional\npay-as-you-go\npurchase\narrangement The calculation is made by the grantee\nusing the guidance set forth in FTA's Final Rule on Capital\nLeases and involves a self-certified net present value\nanalysis of costs and benefits. The most common rationale\nfor lease financing over a pay-as-you-go program is\navoiding the cost inflation inherent with later purchases, as\nwell as the economics of scale afforded by larger, one-time\npurchases.\nKey Legal Issue: Under state law, the threshold legal\nissue is whether the lease or COP structure is permitted,\nwithout voter approval, under constitutional and statutory\nprovisions. The key legal issue for FTA approval is the cost\nbenefit analysis of the financing.\nJEFFREY\nA\nPARKER,\nHow\nTO\nEVALUATE\nOPPORTUNITIES FOR CROSS BORDER LEASING AND\nCERTIFICATES OF PARTICIPATION 78 (1993)\n\nCase Study--Sacramento Regional Transit District\n$32.44 Million California Transit Finance Corporation\nCertificates of Participation, 1992 Series A\nIn the spring of 1992, the Sacramento Regional\nTransit District of Sacramento, California, participated in\nthe sale of $32.44 million COPs to finance the acquisition\nof approximately 75 buses, a fare collection system, and a\nradio system The COPs represented proportionate interests\nin the lease payments to be made by the District to the\nCalifornia Transit Finance Corporation (CTFC), a nonprofit\ncorporation, for lease of the project. One of the sources of\nrevenue supporting the District's lease payments is a FTA\nSection 9 capital grant.\nThe Parties\nThe Sacramento Regional Transit District is a\nlegislatively created transit district that encompasses an\narea of 340 square miles, including the City of Sacramento\nand most of the urbanized area within Sacramento County.\nThe City of Sacramento is the state capital of California\nlocated approximately 75 miles northeast of San Francisco\nThe County of Sacramento has a population of over 1\nmillion, approximately onethird of which live within the\nCity of Sacramento. The District operates a fleet of 200\nbuses and an 18.3-mile light rail line.\nCTFC is a nonprofit public benefit corporation\ncreated in 1990 by the California Transit Association to\nprovide financing assistance to California transit entities.\nCTFC provides transit agencies with standardized lease\nfinancing documents for stand-alone and pooled COPs\nsupported in part by FTA Section 9 capital grants The\nCTFC structure has been market tested by the major rating\nagencies as well as the public finance capital markets.\nTypically, CTFC transactions involve a preestablished\nfinancing team of financial advisors, bond counsel,\nunderwriter, and underwriter's counsel. To date, CTFC has\nparticipated in at least six successful COP financings\ninvolving FTA Section 9 funds.\nThe Project\nThe project included three components: (1) Purchasing\n75 heavy-duty transit buses, (2) Installing a fare collection\nsystem, and (3) Installing a new radio system The buses are\napproximately 40 feet long by 102 inches wide, equipped\nwith natural gas engines, air conditioning, and front and\nrear doors with a wheelchair lift at the front door. Delivery\nof the buses was anticipated to take place over a period of\n16 to 22 months. Cost of the buses was estimated at $21.5\nmillion, which included acquisition and delivery costs.\nThe new fare collection system was for the District's\nbus fleet (now 200 buses). The fare collection system\nconsisted of 200 registering fare boxes plus cash boxes,\nfive receiver vaults, and a data collection system to record\ncash received onboard the buses. The onboard registration\nfeature aids the drivers in determining whether proper fare\nhas been received and also provides\ninformation that can be used to reconcile and audit cash\nreceipts. The cost was estimated at $2.0 million.\nThe radio system replaced an aging 14-year-old, three-\nchannel system that was experiencing frequent breakdowns\nand gaps in geographical coverage. The new system was to\nbe a six-channel \"trunk\" radio system providing the\nnecessary flexibility for bus, rail, and paratransit services\nover the next 12 years. The equipment procured consisted\nof three base stations, 300 mobile units, and a number of\nhand-held portable radios. The cost was estimated at $4.0\nmillion.\nThe Financing\nAs indicated in the Official Statement dated April 8,\n1992, proceeds of the Certificates were allocated as\nfollows:\nAcquisition Fund (1)\n$25,194,696\nLease Payment Fund (2)\n3,231,382\nReserve Fund (3)\n3,213,601\nFinancing Fee (4)\n496,332\nOriginal Issue Discount\n303,939\nTotal Principal Amount of Certificates\n$32,440,000\n(1) Includes Delivery Costs\n(2) All of the interest accrued with respect to the\nCertificates from the date of execution and\ndelivery of the Certificates through December 1,\n1993, and a portion of the interest due on the\nCertificates from January 1, 1994 through April\n1, 1994, was capitalized.\n(3) Equal to 10% of principal amount of the\nCertificates, less original issue discount\n(4) Includes Underwriter's discount and certain\ncosts of issuance associated with the execution\nand delivery of the Certificates\nThe Lease Payment Fund was funded with COP\nproceeds sufficient to make all lease payments due prior to\nthe expected completion date of the project.\nEach Certificate represents a proportionate interest in\nthe lease payments to be made by the District to the\nCorporation under the financing lease. The Corporation,\npursuant to an assignment agreement, assigned its rights\nand remedies under the Lease Agreement (except certain\nrights to indemnity and reimbursement of expenses) to the\ntrustee bank for the benefit of the owners of the\nCertificates, including its right to receive lease payments.\nPrincipal and interest due with respect to the Certificates is\nmade from the lease payments payable by the District;\ninsurance or condemnation proceeds pertaining to the\nproject, to the extent that such proceeds are not used for\nrepair or replacement; and interest or other income derived\nfrom the investment of the funds and accounts by the\nTrustee pursuant to the Trust Agreement. Lease payments\nare paid from revenues of the District.\nThe District applied for a Letter of No Prejudice from\nFTA, pursuant to ISTEA, for the reimbursement of a\nportion of the capital costs of acquiring the project. Prior to\nthe closing of the financing, the District received a\nnotification from FTA indicating FTA's preliminary\n\napproval (subject to final review of legal documents) for\nthe annual reimbursement to the District of 80 percent of\nthe lease payments net of capitalized interest and the\nearnings on the reserve fund (the \"Net Lease Payments\").\nThe District included the following disclosure in its\nofficial statement for the financing:\nAlthough\nISTEA\nprovides\nfederal\nfunding\nfor\ntransportation purposes through the federal government's\nfiscal year ending September 30, 1997, receipt of\nfunding by the District for any fiscal year beyond the\ncurrent federal fiscal year is subject to future\nCongressional appropriation for transit purposes and\nfuture submittal of grant applications by the District with\nthe FTA Receipt of funding by the District for any\nfederal fiscal year beyond the federal fiscal year ending\nSeptember 30, 1997 is subject to future Congressional\nauthorization Furthermore, although ISTEA establishes\nthe federal matching ratios for transit projects at 80%, no\nassurances can be made that the funding level for the\nFTA Project Grants at 80% of Net Lease Payments\nexpected to be preliminarily approved by FTA under\nSection 9 for the FT Act (as hereinafter defined) will be\ncontinued in any future Congressional authorization\nThe District expects to fund the remaining portion of\nLease Payments which are not funded with the FTA\nProject Grants from Revenues, which include State and\nlocal funds and other legally available sources.\nDue to the contingent nature of the federal grants,\nrating agencies rely on the ability of the District to make\nlease payments from other revenue sources in assigning a\ncredit rating to the transaction. The District receives\nportions of the local sales tax and gas tax moneys levied\npursuant to state law and a local sales tax initiative. This\nrevenue, which is independent of fare box revenue, is used\nfor the local match for the FTA grants. For this issue the\nDistrict was assigned a rating of A-1 by Moody's Investors\nService.\nThe lease payments were structured with equal\nprincipal payments of approximately $2,705,000 each year,\nresulting in a declining annual payment in order to\napproximate the depreciating value of the buses and to\nprotect investors from a possible change in FTA funding.\nThe issuance of the COPs enabled the District to\nreceive a favorable bid on a large bus order, resulting in\nmore capital assets for less expenditure of funds. Economy\nof scale was also realized in the low issuance costs\nallocable to the remaining portions of the project.\nThe key legal issue as to what authority existed under\nstate law to enter into the lease was determined by the\nDistrict's special counsel. The FTA's approval or letter of\nno prejudice was the key factor in allowing the District to\ndetermine to proceed with the financing. The role of\nAgency counsel, as is true for most innovative financing\ntechniques, is to render opinions that the Agency has the\nauthority to engage in the transaction and to ensure that the\nproper procedural steps for the adoption of the required\nAgency resolutions have been followed by the Agency.\nSpecial counsel is customarily engaged to provide opinions\nto the investors in the\nCOPs or to the counterparties involved in other innovative\nfinancing transactions.\nCase Study-$9.66 Million California Transit Finance\nCorporation Certificates of Participation, 1996 Series A\n(City of Culver City, California)\nOn June 4, 1996, the City of Culver City, California\nand the CTFC participated in the sale of $9.66 million\naggregate principal amount of COPs to finance a portion of\nthe construction costs relating to the city's Transportation\nAdministration/Maintenance facility. One of the sources of\nrevenue supporting the Certificates is FTA Section 9 capital\ngrants. This transaction involved a number of significant\ninnovations, which are discussed in more detail below.\nThe Parties\nThe City of Culver City, California, is located about 8\nmiles west of downtown Los Angeles and 2 miles north of\nthe Los Angeles International Airport, encompassing an\narea of almost 5 square miles. In 1994 the city had a\npopulation of approximately 38,793. The city operates the\nCulver City Municipal Bus Lines (CCMBL), the second\noldest municipally owned bus agency in the State of\nCalifornia. CCMBL maintains a fleet of 33 buses, of which\n30 are used in regular service.\nThe CTFC is a nonprofit public benefit corporation\ncreated in 1990 by the California Transit Association to\nprovide financing assistance to California transit entities.\nCTFC provides transit agencies with standardized lease\nfinancing documents for stand-alone and pooled COPs\nsupported in part by FTA Section 9 capital grants. The\nCTFC structure has been market tested by the major rating\nagencies as well as the public finance capital markets.\nTypically, CTFC transactions involve a preestablished\nfinancing team of financial advisors, bond counsel,\nunderwriter, and underwriter's counsel. To date, CTFC has\nparticipated in at least five successful COP financings\ninvolving FTA Section 9 funds.\nThe Project\nPrior to the financing, CCMBL provided bus\nmaintenance services on a crowded 3.96-acre City Yard\nsite shared with the city's Public Works, Parks\nMaintenance, and Purchasing Divisions. In order to provide\nmore efficient and cost-effective service, CCMBL\nproposed a plan to the FTA that included (i) dedicating the\nentire City Yard site for public transit purposes, (ii)\ndemolishing existing buildings and constructing a new\nparking structure and transit facility, including an\nadministrative/maintenance building containing a fueling\nisland, bus washer, eight bus bays, inspection area, and a\nwelding shop, and (iii) purchasing a new site and\nremodeling an existing building to accommodate the\ndisplaced city divisions. The project described above would\nallow CCMBL to increase its bus fleet from 33 to 60 in\nanticipation of increased demand for public transit service.\nThe FTA accepted and approved CCMBL's proposal\n\nthrough\ntheir\nadoption\nof\na\nFederal\nHighway\nAdministration rule referred to as \"functional replacement.\"\nThe total cost of the project was estimated at $23.8\nmillion Certificate proceeds provided approximately $8.4\nmillion, with the balance of the cost being paid by city\ncontributions and FTA Section 9 capital grants (in addition\nto the Section 9 funds expected to pay debt service on the\nCertificates).\nThe Financing\nThe CTFC Certificates represent a proportionate\ninterest in lease payments made by the city to CTFC under\na lease agreement between the city and CTFC. CTFC\nassigned these lease payments to the trustee for the\nCertificates, as well as any insurance or condemnation\nproceeds relating to the property encumbered by the Lease\nAgreement, to the extent not required for the repair or\nreplacement of such property. Payments under the Lease\nAgreement are payable only from \"revenues\" of the city,\nwhich are defined as (i) certain FTA Section 9 capital grant\nfunds, (ii) the Local Transportation Fund portion of\nCalifornia Transportation Development Act funds, (iii) the\ncity's share of State Transit Assistance Funds and (iv) the\ncity's discretionary and local return portion of two 1/2 cent\ntransportation sales taxes levied in Los Angeles County.\nGeneral fund moneys of the city are not included in the\ndefinition of \"revenues\" and are therefore not available to\nmake payments under the Lease Agreement. The Lease\nAgreement provides that the obligation of the city to make\npayments under the Lease Agreement solely from revenues\nis unconditional and not subject to abatement in the event\nof a casualty loss involving the leased facilities.\nThe Certificates are also secured by a reserve fund\nheld by the trustee, funded at maximum annual debt service\non the Certificates. Finally, the payment of principal and\ninterest with respect to the Certificates is guaranteed by a\nmunicipal bond insurance policy issued by AMBAC\nIndemnity Corporation.\nThe Certificates represent a clear progression in the\nmanner FTA Section 9 supported COPs have been\nstructured The primary innovation is the use of real\nproperty instead of buses to serve as the asset encumbered\nby the Lease Agreement. This produces several financial\nbenefits to the city. Since the city's Transportation\nAdministration/Maintenance facility has a longer useful life\nthan vehicles, the city was able to spread out its payments\nover a 20-year term, as opposed to the 12year term usually\nseen in bus financings. In addition, there will be sufficient\nrental value in the project to allow for level debt service\ninstead of the declining payments that are associated with\nbus leases, again maximizing the benefits of tax-exempt\nfinancing.\nFTA permitted the use of Section 9 capital grant\nmoneys to support the financing costs of the project\nbecause the city's Transportation\nAdministration/Maintenance facility is clearly transit-\nrelated. In\naddition, FTA allowed Section 9 funds to account for 100\npercent of debt service on the Certificates, as opposed to\nthe traditional 80 percent match. The rationale for this\narrangement is that the city contributed approximately $3.9\nmillion of land upon which the project will be located and\nfurther contributed $3.1 million in cash to finance the\nproject. These up-front contributions satisfied the FTA's\nrequirement of a 20 percent local match for FTA Section 9\nprojects.\nAnother innovative feature of the Certificates involves\nthe lack of capitalized interest. Typically, the FTA requires\ninterest payments on Section 9 lease financings to be\ncapitalized for a period sufficient to allow the construction\nor acquisition of the asset encumbered by the lease. Until\nthe asset is ready for use and occupancy, FTA Section 9\ncapital grants may not be used to pay debt service. This\npolicy mirrors the practice of most bond counsel firms in\nCalifornia, which generally require capitalized interest\nprior to the construction or acquisition of the leased asset so\nthat the initial lease payments will not violate the debt limit\nembodied in Article XVI, Section 18 of the California\nConstitution. The need to capitalize interest increases the\namount of COPs required to be sold and increases the total\ndebt service obligation of the governmental lessee.\nSince the relevant lease payments consist of special\nrevenues not subject to the State Constitutional debt limit,\nFTA policy for this transaction mirrored State law in this\nregard and permitted FTA Section 9 supported lease\npayments to be made prior to the completion of the city's\nTransportation Administration/Maintenance facility.\nAnother unique aspect of this transaction is the use of\na bond insurance policy to enhance the rating of the\nCertificates to AAA/Aaa by Standard & Poor's Ratings\nServices and Moody's Investors Service, respectively. The\npremium for this bond insurance was less than the net\npresent value of the marginally higher interest that would\nhave been payable on an unenhanced issue. This is\napparently the first new issue FTA Section 9 supported\nCOP to have been enhanced by bond insurance.\nThe use of bond insurance and real property as the\nleased asset represents a logical extension of the COP\nstructure inherent in these financings. So long as a\ngovernmental entity can demonstrate to the FTA a\nsufficient transit purpose, further financings can reflect\nvarious permutations, including \"asset transfer\" or \"asset\nstrip\" structures, variable rate COPs backed by liquidity\nfacilities, and other complex arrangements that are now\ncommonplace for non-FTA supported COPs.\nBond counsel (or special counsel as they are\nsometimes described in COP financings) delivered the\ncustomary legal opinion in this transaction that the Lease\nAgreement was a valid and binding obligation of the city.\nSuch opinion is customarily required on all publicly sold\nCOP financings by an independent bond counsel firm.\nBond counsel makes this determination based on case law\nor may require the issuing entity to file a\n\n_____________________________________\n_____________________________________\nvalidation action or some other similar court proceeding to\ndetermine the validity of the transaction prior to proceeding\nwith the transaction.\nThe authority for lease financing is very well\ndeveloped in California.7 In other jurisdictions, case law\nauthority may not be as developed and in considering any\nlease financing, the threshold legal issues are whether there\nis authority to enter into the lease financing and whether\nthere is any constitutional impediment to the lease\ntransaction.\nIII--JOINT DEVELOPMENT\nIntroduction\nAnother promising method of innovative financing for\ntransit projects is joint development projects. This chapter\nwill include a discussion of joint development and the\nissues it raises.\nThe Structure of a Joint Development Transaction\nJoint development involves a partnership or joint\nventure between a transit agency and a private developer to\ndevelop certain assets It can also mean a relationship\nwhereby the transit agency receives revenues or transit\nfacilities and the developer receives use of either real estate\nor some other asset owned by the transit agency. Joint\ndevelopment is seen as a method by which private funds\nare used to develop transit property resulting in profit for\nthe private developer and a developed asset for the transit\nagency. Risks related to the development are either shared\nor borne by the transit agency or the private developer.\nOne of the chief assets that transit agencies commonly\nhave that can be made available for development by a\nprivate developer is real estate. An example is where a\ntransit agency has a surface park-and-ride lot and in\nexchange for a portion of the lot, the developer will agree\nto construct a parking structure on the remaining surface\nparking area. The increased development may mean greater\nresidential density or commercial activity next to the transit\nfacility, leading to increased ridership. Although real estate\nis the most common asset that a transit agency uses in order\nto participate in a joint development project, the right-of\nway that a transit agency maintains is also an asset that can\nbe used in a joint development scenario\nMany different purposes are served by joint\ndevelopment and one of the issues to be considered by a\ntransit agency when undertaking joint development is\nwhich policies it wishes to further. The most common\npolicy is one of increased revenues. Through leasing or\nother use of transit property, revenues are sought to be\ngenerated. Another purpose of joint development is\nincreased ridership. By creating a higher density of\nresidential or\n7 In Rider v City of San Diego, 18 Cal 4th 1035, 959 P 2d\n347 (Cal 1998), the California Supreme Court upheld a\nconstitutional challenge to a lease financing and noted the long\nhistory of court cases upholding such financings\ncommercial\nareas\naround\na\ntransit\nfacility,\njoint\ndevelopment can lead to new ridership or use of the transit\nfacilities. Another purpose may be to enhance the transit\nfacility itself. By converting a bare park-and-ride lot to a\ntransit village with both commercial and residential\nfacilities, the transit facility is made a more attractive\nalternative with added security and conveniences. Whereas\ncurrently revenue generation is the primary focus of transit\nagencies in joint development projects, in the future,\nenhancement of transit facilities and increased ridership\nmay take preeminence over revenue considerations.\nLegal and Policy Authority for Joint Development\nThe authority for pursuing joint development is\ncontained in a mix of congressional legislation, Executive\nOrders, and FTA policy initiatives. For example, Section\n5309(a)(1)(E) of the Federal Transit Act, as amended,\nprovided that the Secretary of Transportation may make\ngrants or loans to assist in financing projects that (i)\nenhance the effectiveness of any mass transportation\nproject and are physically or functionally related to such\nmass transportation project or (ii) create or enhance\ncoordination between mass transportation and other forms\nof transportation, either of which enhance urban economic\ndevelopment or incorporate private investment.8\nGrants under the Federal Transit Act can be made for\nproperty acquisition; demolition of existing structures; site\npreparation; utilities; building foundations, walkways, and\nopen space; and the acquisition, construction, and\nimprovement of facilities and equipment for intermodal\ntransport facilities and transit malls, but generally may not\nbe made to finance the construction of commercial\nrevenue-producing facilities or those portions of public\nfacilities not related to mass transportation.9 The Federal\nTransit Act also permits federal participation in land\nacquisition, demolition of existing structures, and site\npreparation for mixed use projects.\nAdditional authority for joint development is\nembodied in ISTEA, which encourages more efficient\nmanagement\nand\nenhancement\nof\npublic\ntransit\ninfrastructure through the creation of public/private\npartnerships. Joint development also finds support in\nExecutive\nOrder\n12893,\n\"Principles\nfor\nFederal\nInfrastructure Investments,\" signed by the President on\nJanuary 26, 1994.

The Livable\nCommunities Initiative endorses mixed use development\nand describes certain characteristics of successful \"livable\ncommunities\":\nLivable Communities involve careful coordination of\ntransit planning with community development planning\nLivable communities are neighborhoods where housing,\nschools and parks are within easy walking distance of\nuser-friendly transit opportunities that effectively link\nresidents with local social and economic services and\njobs In livable communities, transit service reflects the\ndiverse needs of the community.\nTransit facilities [in Livable Communities] are designed\nto include space for day care centers, dry cleaners, and\nother enterprises that are useful to transit passengers.\nUnder the Livable Communities Initiative, the FTA\nmay provide Section 5309 (formerly Section 3) and Section\n5336 (formerly Section 9) capital grants for enhancements\nto transit stations; park and ride lots; transfer points\nincorporating\ncommunity\nservice\nand\ncustomer\nconvenience facilities (such as health care centers, banks,\nretail services and the like); safety elements; sidewalks;\nskyways; access roadways; and other transit-related\nimprovements.\nThe Livable Communities Initiative requires transit\nagencies\nproposing\nfederally-funded\nprojects\nto\ndemonstrate that the projects are transit-related and\npromote the concept of livable community in the area\nadjacent to the project. The FTA requires a local match of\n20 percent for all grants under the Livable Communities\nInitiative.\nFinally, the FTA published its Innovative Financing\nInitiative on May 9, 1995,10 which gives explicit support\nfor joint development using Section 3 and Section 9\nfunding, as well as funding under the STP and Congestion\nManagement Air Quality Programs. The Innovative\nFinancing Initiative announced:\n[A]ssets previously acquired with FTA funds may be\nused for joint development purposes For example, land\nnow used for station parking and no longer needed for\ntransit purposes may be converted to use in a transit-\nrelated development project..

The FTA's\nsubjective approach may arise from the conflict between\nthe private sector participation inherent in all joint\ndevelopment and long-standing federal policy that\ndiscourages undue private benefit from public agency\ngrants.\nThis policy is evident in the complex and stringent\nInternal Revenue Service regulations regarding the private\nuse of projects financed with proceeds of tax exempt bonds.\nAnother example of this policy is the general rule that\ntransit assets funded by federal grants must remain in mass\ntransit service over the life of the asset. If the asset is\nremoved from mass transit service during its useful life,\nthen the prorated, depreciated federal share of the asset\nmust be rebated to the federal government. This result can\nbe mitigated, however, by transferring the federal interest\nin certain assets to other transit assets, in accordance with\nthe FTA's guidelines.12\nKey Legal Issue: Issues that are raised in joint\ndevelopment focus on the statutory authority of the agency\nto undertake the joint development activity (public bidding\nrequirements may prohibit the structure); the limitation on\nany funding available for joint development, whether it be\nstate, federal or local; and whether there are any tax law\nrestrictions on the various funding mechanisms available\nfor the joint development project.\nCase Study--Vertical Mall Joint Development for\nMiami-Dade Transit Agency (Dade County, Florida)\nThe Miami-Dade Transit Agency (MDTA) recently\ncompleted construction on an ambitious joint development\nproject adjacent to one of its heavy rail transit stations. The\nprocess began over a decade ago, and Miami-Dade's\nexperience is illustrative of certain issues that can arise\nwhen undertaking a project involving joint development.\nThe Parties\nThe Miami-Dade Transit Agency is the transit\noperations agency of Miami-Dade County, Florida. Miami-\nDade serves the greater Miami metropolitan area, operating\napproximately 600 buses as well as the 21-mile elevated\nrail line known as Metrorail.\nThe private developers involved in Miami-Dade's\ndevelopment project were the Green Companies, Jeff\nBerkowitz & Co., and Mark Millgram & Co., in a joint\nventure.\n11 FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION, INNOVATIVE\nFINANCING HANDBOOK (undated)\n12 FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION, INNOVATIVE\nFINANCING INITIATIVE, 60 Fed. Reg. 24681-84 (May 9, 1995).\n\n_____________________________________\nThe Project\nThe existing site upon which the project was\nconstructed consisted of a 9.2-acre park-and-ride lot\ncontaining approximately 750 parking spaces, adjacent to\nMiami-Dade's heavy rail Dadeland North Station. Miami-\nDade originally purchased this land with Urban Mass\nTransportation Administration (UMTA)13 capital grant\nfunds. Shortly before construction of the project, the State\nof Florida financed the construction of an above-ground\nparking structure with approximately 2,000 parking spaces\nadjacent to the Dadeland North Site. Phase 1 of the project\nitself involved a \"vertical mall\" containing approximately\n315,000 square feet of retail space, at a construction cost of\napproximately $40 million. The developers of the vertical\nmall entered into a 90-year ground lease with Miami-Dade\nfor the use of the Dadeland North Site.\nThe Financing\nIn 1981, Miami-Dade issued a Request for Proposals\n(RFP) for the Lease and Joint Development of the Dade\nNorth Metrorail Station Site. Pursuant to this RFP, Miami-\nDade selected the Green Companies, and protracted\nnegotiations followed for approximately 12 years. In 1994,\nunder the threat of Miami-Dade issuing a new RFP to\ndevelopers, the Green Companies, in a joint venture with\nJeff Berkowitz & Co., and Mark Millgram & Co.,\nnegotiated a revised arrangement with Miami-Dade that\nincluded the following provisions:\n1. Minimum rent to be paid to Miami-Dade for the use of\nthe Dadeland North Site will not be less than $100,000\nper year, plus 5 percent of gross revenues from the\noperation of the vertical mall Miami-Dade has projected\nthis 5 percent portion to be approximately $1,500,000,\nwhich will generate an estimated $40,000,000 in\nadditional revenue for Miami-Dade over the 25-year\nlease term\n2. If Miami-Dade discontinues transit service to and\nfrom the Dadeland North Station, the parties agree to\nreview the impact of such termination and make an\nequitable adjustment in the lease.\n3. Construction plans shall include several \"transit\nfriendly\" design features\nWhile Miami-Dade's impasse with the developers was\nbeing resolved, a new hurdle arose-FTA approval. The\nfederal government retained an interest in the Dadeland\nNorth Site because Miami-Dade's purchase of the land was\nfinanced with an UMTA capital grant. In 1989, UMTA\napproved a proposed lease between Miami-Dade and the\nGreen Companies, but the parties could not agree on certain\nmajor business points. By the time Miami-Dade was able to\nreach agreement with the developers in 1994, the FTA\n(through its Region IV Office) had disapproved the project.\nThe FTA's Region IV Office noted that after project\ncompletion, the Dadeland North Site would technically\n13 UMTA or Urban Mass Transportation Administration was the predecessor\nto the Federal Transit Administration.\nno longer have a transit use. The Region IV Office made it\nclear if the project went forward, Miami-Dade would be\nexpected to buy out the FTA's interest in the property. In\nsupport of their decision, the Region IV Office cited the\nprovisions of Office of Management and Budget Circular\nA-102 (March 3, 1988), which requires the disposition of\nUMTA-financed property no longer used for a transit\npurpose.\nMiami-Dade\nappealed\nthis\ndecision\nto\nFTA\nheadquarters in Washington, DC. Miami-Dade argued that\na strict interpretation of the OMB Circular would contradict\nseveral\npolicy\npronouncements\npromoting\njoint\ndevelopment. Miami-Dade stressed the transit purpose of\nthe project as a whole and noted that all rental income from\nthe project would be used only for public transit. Moreover,\nMiami-Dade predicted that the project would increase its\nridership by at least 200,000 riders per year. Miami-Dade\nultimately prevailed and on June 28, 1994, the FTA granted\nits formal approval of the project.\nCase\nStudy--Santa\nClara\nValley\nTransportation\nAgency--Almaden Lake Village\nThe Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority\n(VTA), in partnership with the Almaden Lake Village\nAssociates, is in the process of developing a highdensity\nrental community on the Guadalupe Corridor light rail\nsystem's Almaden park-and-ride lot. The building of the\nAlmaden Lake Village is the first project of its type in the\nnation and is targeted at residents who are priced out of the\nhousing market and/or those who choose the convenience\nand amenities of luxury apartment living with easy access\nto transit.\nThe Parties\nThe VTA is the transit agency for the City of San Jose\nand the other 14 cities located in the County of Santa Clara,\nwhich contains the largest population in the San Francisco\nBay area and a thriving manufacturing and services section,\nincluding the famed Silicon Valley concentration of high-\ntech computer firms.\nAlmaden Lake Village Associates is a limited\nliability partnership established by the developer of the\nproject.\nThe Project\nAlmaden Lake Village was completed in 1998. It is\nbuilt on 7.1 acres (5.4 acres net) of VTA-owned land at the\nAlmaden park-and-ride lot at Winfield Boulevard and\nColeman Road in San Jose. The high-density, multi-\nresidential complex includes 250 units, with a density of\n47.2 dwelling units per net acre.\nThe purpose of the Almaden Lake Village Project and\nsubsequent high-density residential projects is threefold.\nFirst, to allow VTA to generate a continuing revenue\nstream in order to defray operating and other expenses;\nsecond, to use high-density residential development in\norder to gain as many new riders as\n\npossible for the transit system; and third, to enhance the\nenvironment at and around the park-and-ride lots and\nprovide a sense of \"place\" and \"community\" at those\nlocations\nThe Almaden Lake Village project is primarily a\nmarket-rate apartment development with 20 percent of the\nunits available to low-income households. Subsequent\nprojects could incorporate affordable housing units and,\nperhaps, a commercial/retail component into the design.\nThe project cost $32 million and was built on property\nleased from VTA under a 75-year ground lease. The rental\nof the land for the project is the direct monetary benefit the\nagency receives from this joint development.\nThe Financing\nVTA established a joint development program to\nidentify and implement joint development opportunities at\nVTA-owned park-and-ride lots. The first step in\nimplementing the program was to assess the benefits of and\nopportunities for joint development. Studies conducted\nranked the Almaden light rail park-and-ride lot as the first\nmost feasible location for a joint development project.\nStudies also found that the benefits of joint development\n(i.e., revenue production, increase in transit ridership, and\nenhancements to the environment around the transit\nfacility) at this site would come from a high-density\nresidential development.\nVTA has long pursued strategies to increase ridership\nand seek out additional revenue sources. The Almaden\nLake Village Joint Development project will help to meet\nthese objectives. It will supplement fare box revenues and\nbecause of its higher than average densities and direct link\nto the station, increased ridership is expected.\nPark Place, in Mountain View, a 370-unit project\ndevelopment by Prometheus featuring three-story buildings\nover a podium with subgrade parking, was selected as the\nbest prototype for the project, since a design of its type\nwould cost less to build and it commands the highest rents\nin Santa Clara County. The architect for Park Place, Fisher\nFriedman Associates, was hired to design a project for\nAlmaden Lake Village modeled after Park Place.\nThe Almaden Lake Village 250-unit complex has two\nand three-story buildings on podiums over subgrade\nparking and features fully-secured main grounds and inner-\ncourtyards with easy pedestrian access to the Almaden\nTransit Station and Guadalupe River Park. An East Block\nand a West Block are situated on either side of a connecting\nroad that provides car and bus traffic with road access. The\nexisting roadway was moved 100 feet to the west to\naccommodate this combined use and maximize the\nefficiency of the site.\nAdditional project amenities include a lap pool and\nspa, 3,300-square-feet recreation center with community\nlounge, meeting rooms, and a fully-equipped fitness center.\nWater features and landscaping are an integral part of the\nproject.\nThe developer for the project was chosen by VTA\nfollowing a request for proposal process. Financing for the\nAlmaden Lake Village project is solely the responsibility of\nthe project developer. VTA's board was firm in not\nassuming any risk with respect to the development and not\nsubsidizing the development other than by providing the\nland and agreeing to subordinate the lease payments for the\nland to the financing required for the project. The developer\ninitially sought a loan from the Department of Housing and\nUrban Development (HUD), but after a series of delays it\nwas determined that the HUD loan was too problematic and\nthe process too lengthy. Tax credits were next analyzed as a\npossible means of financing the project, but due to a rules\nchange, the tax credit route was not considered feasible.\nFinally, financing the project through the issuance of tax\nexempt bonds as a multifamily housing project, containing\n20 percent low-income units, was determined to be the\nmost advantageous option.\nThe City of San Jose was instrumental in providing\nthe bond financing, which requires an allocation of the state\nvolume cap for private activity bonds. Support of the local\ngovernment appears to be a key element in the success of\nthe joint development project. Local zoning and permits\nneed to be granted for the project to proceed in a timely\nmanner.\nAn\naggressive\ncampaign\nof\ncommunity\ninvolvement and support in the project can be beneficial. It\nis possible for community activists to focus on the joint\ndevelopment project as a means of illiciting more amenities\nfrom the city, such as additional parks and landscaping.\nFollowing the necessary bond approval and cap\nallocation from the state, bond financing allowed the\nconstruction to proceed. VTA anticipates receiving\nrevenues from the project in the form of annual lease\npayments, which were set pursuant to a market rate based\non an appraisal of the land. One of the advantages of the\nAlmaden site was that the land was not purchased with\nfederal transit funds so FTA approval was not required.\nIn the future, the VTA may be less risk adverse and\nseek to play a more active role in the development. This\nmay include expanding the type of development to include\ncommercial facilities as well as housing facilities. Correct\nassessment of the feasibility of a proposed joint\ndevelopment project may require that the VTA obtain\nanalysis from a neutral third-party (not the developer) with\nexpertise in the area. The Almaden Lake Village may prove\nto be a prototype for future developments of park-and-ride\nlots.\nVarious legal issues were raised in the development of\nthe joint development project and were addressed by\ndifferent counsels, as appropriate. The initial key legal\nissue was the legality of choosing a developer for the site\nthrough an RFP process, a modified public bidding process\nallowed under state law. This decision as to the legality of\nthe RFP was made at the agency counsel level. Special\ncounsel was involved in the financing, as well as attorneys\nfor the City of San Jose.\n\nCase Study--San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit\nDistrict (BART) Telecommunications System\nIn 1994 BART solicited RFPs from private developers\ninterested in installing, maintaining, managing, and\nmarketing a fiber optic telecommunications system under a\nlong-term license agreement that would provide revenue\nsharing to BART and at the same time meet BART's own\ntelecommunication needs.\nThe Parties\nBART is a legislatively-established voter approved\ntransit district covering three counties in the San Francisco\nBay Area. The BART system is a 39-station, 93 mile\nregional rail system currently serving approximately 2 9\nmillion people in the three San Francisco Bay Area\ncounties: Alameda and Contra Costa Counties and the City\nand County of San Francisco. The system began passenger\noperations in 1972. It is the principal commuting\ntransportation system for residents of Alameda and Contra\nCosta Counties who work in the City and County of San\nFrancisco, accounting for 57 percent of all transbay, home-\nto-work trips that terminate in the core part of San\nFrancisco's central business district The District owns\napproximately 650 rail cars, which operate over 93 miles of\ndouble mainline tracks. Twenty-eight of those miles are in\nthe subway, 24 miles are on an elevated structure, and 43\nmiles are at grade. An extension south of San Francisco\nthrough San Mateo County to the San Francisco\nInternational Airport is currently being developed. BART\nhas some unique physical assets in that it has transit lines\nthat run in the East Bay, a transbay tube that runs under San\nFrancisco Bay to downtown San Francisco, and a line\nrunning through San Francisco that eventually will extend\nto the San Francisco International Airport. This system\nprovides an asset in the form of a right of way upon which\na fiber optic network may be installed.\nThe\nMetropolitan\nFiber\nSystem\nNetwork\nTechnologies, Inc., (MFSNT) was chosen pursuant to the\nRFP process to develop the telecommunications system.\nThe Project\nThe MFSNT/BART contract and agreements provide\nfor the development of a telesystem consisting of a\ncommercial fiber optic telecommunications system and a\nfully integrated BART telecommunications system. A\nportion of the conduit system's capacity will be used to\nsupport the BART telecommunications system. The\nremaining capacity will be made available by MFSNT for\ncommercial use, which will generate revenue for BART as\ndescribed below. The BART telecommunications system\nwill replace BART's existing telecommunications system\nwith a new trunk radio system, a synchronous fiber-optic\nbased data transmission network, and the hardware and\nsoftware to fully integrate the entire system for BART's\nuse. The BART telecommunications system is a one-of-a\nkind system within the transit industry. Other transit\nproperties have portions\nof\nthe\nproposed\nimprovements,\nbut\nthe\nBART\ntelecommunications system is unique.\nThe BART telecommunications system was financed\npursuant to a lease with MFSNT with principal components\nin the amount of approximately $45 million. MFSNT\nsupplies all of the equipment for and provides engineering\nand construction management services to fully integrate the\nBART telecommunications system. Construction work\nassociated\nwith\nthe\ninstallation\nof\nthe\nBART\ntelecommunications system (estimated at 10 percent to 20\npercent of the cost of the BART telecommunications\nsystem) was competitively bid by BART. In the event that\nBART's competitive bid process results in a cost that\nexceeds the $45 million, MFSNT agreed to pay the\ndifference. In the event that BART's competitive bid\nprocess results in a cost that is less than the $45 million,\nMFSNT agreed to reduce BART's financial obligation\naccordingly. BART entered into a 15-year Equipment\nLease-Purchase\ncontract\nwith\nMFSNT\nfor\nthe\ntelecommunications system. MFSNT retains ownership of\nthe BART telecommunications system for the term of the\ncontract. At the end of the term, ownership will transfer to\nBART. BART has an option to purchase the equipment\nduring the term of the lease purchase contract.\nMFSNT provides the materials for, owns, and operates\nthe conduit system in BART's right of way for revenue\ngeneration under a 15-year Telecommunications License\nAgreement. Installation of the conduit system was\ncompetitively bid. In return, BART shares in the revenue\ngenerated from MFSNT's operation of the portion of the\nconduit system that is not required for the BART system.\nAt the end of the term, ownership will transfer to BART. It\nwas originally projected that revenues from the commercial\noperations would offset most of the cost of the financing\nfor the BART telecommunications system.\nThe Financing\nIn the course of the joint development project with\nMFSNT, a number of legal issues had to be addressed.\nAmong these were the public bidding requirements that\ncontrol BART's ability to enter into the contract with\nMFSNT. Certain parts of the project, such as installation of\nthe conduit that contains the fiber optics, were contracted\npursuant to competitive bid. However, the major aspect of\nthe acquisition of the equipment was accomplished through\nthe RFP process.\nCalifornia Public Contract Code Section 20229.1\nauthorizes the BART Board of Directors to direct the\nprocurement of certain equipment, including electronic\nequipment, by competitive negotiation, upon a finding, by a\ntwo-thirds vote of the BART Board, that the purchase of\nequipment in compliance with the provisions of the Public\nContract Code generally applicable to such purchases\nwould not be adequate for BART's needs. Competitive\nbidding of a complex integrated system such as the one\nsought by BART did not meet BART's needs, as BART\nwould be constrained in its ability to\n\nevaluate the qualifications of proposers and the technical\nmerit of the proposals. Furthermore, if competitive bidding\nprocedures were used for procurement of the system, it\nwould not be feasible for BART to consider adequately the\nrevenue sharing offered by bidders or the merits of their\nfinancing packages. The RFP process used by BART to\nsolicit proposals for the telecommunications system met the\nrequirements for competitive negotiation.\nAnother issue that arose was that some of the right of\nway owned by BART had been purchased with state\nmoneys provided by the California Department of\nTransportation (Caltrans). Caltrans' consent was therefore\nrequired in order to allow the joint commercial use of the\nright of way by MFSNT. In exchange for Caltrans'\npermission to allow BART to use such joint right of way\nfor the revenue generating telecommunications network,\nBART agreed to allow Caltrans to use a portion of the fiber\noptics cable ability along BART's entire right of way.\nBART and Caltrans also agreed to consider revenue sharing\nin the future. BART's environmental compliance staff\ndetermined that the project would not have any significant\neffect on the environment and, therefore, that the project\nand its approval was exempt from the California\nEnvironmental Quality Act.\nThe joint development project was financed by a lease\npurchase agreement of BART under which the BART\ntelecommunications system was purchased by BART\npursuant to a tax-exempt financing. The financing required\nBART to make payments to the lender; however, payment\ncould be deferred until the project was delivered. Based on\ncertain projections, it was considered possible that revenues\ngenerated by the commercial use of the fiber optics system\nwould be sufficient to offset a major portion of the\npayments required by BART to finance its own\ntelecommunications system. BART, however, was taking a\nfinancial risk. If the revenues generated from the\ncommercial use of the fiber optics system were not\nsufficient, BART's own general fund revenues would\nsupply the funds to pay for the lease purchase financing.\nAnother legal issue that had to be addressed was\nwhether the use by MFSNT of the right of way was\nprohibited by existing bond covenants of BART as portions\nof the right of way had been purchased with taxexempt\nbond proceeds. Bond counsel to BART determined that the\nuse of the right of way by the fiber optic cable was\nincidental and would not adversely affect BART's\noutstanding tax-exempt bonds. BART has recently\ncommenced operations of the telecommunications system.\nRevenues are just now beginning to be realized from the\nuse of the system and it is too early at this point to\ndetermine whether sufficient revenues will be generated to\noffset the cost of BART's telecommunications system\nLessons Learned from Joint Development\nAny joint development project is going to require a\nknowledge of state procurement laws or other restrictions\non the use of transit property at the state level, as well as an\nunderstanding of FTA restrictions if FTA funded property\nis involved in the joint development. The policy behind\nmany of these laws is to ensure that private entities do not\nbenefit from the special use of public property without a\nfair selection process or just compensation. Obtaining the\n\"best price\" for a public asset at public bidding is seen as\nprotection from potentially abusive influence by private\ninterests. Because of the inherent public/private partnership\nin joint development, overcoming the public bidding laws\nis one of the more difficult hurdles. In the joint\ndevelopment projects studied here, the direct economic\nbenefit to the different transit agencies, typically rent\npayments, appears minimal compared to the costs of the\nprojects undertaken. Nonmonetary benefits such as\neconomic development, community development, potential\nincreased ridership, and a free flow of information may\nprovide other justification for joint development. However,\nthe potential for uncompensated or undercompensated\nexploitation of public assets by private firms that are\nunfairly selected is also a concern in any joint development\nproject.\nIV--CROSS-BORDER\nLEASES\nOF\nTRANSIT\nVEHICLES\nIntroduction\nCross-border leasing transactions are designed to\nenable a foreign entity to receive in its country the tax\nbenefits associated with ownership of an item of\nequipment. These transactions are attractive to many transit\nagencies because the foreign entity, the \"lessor\" of the\nequipment, will pay the 'lessee\" (the transit agency)\nbetween approximately 3 percent and 7 percent of the cost\nof the equipment for entering into the transaction. These\nrevenues are then available to the transit agency for any\npurpose. The transaction is structured so that, for practical\npurposes, it does not materially affect the operations of the\ntransit agency. These leases do not \"finance\" the vehicles\nbeing leased; rather, they generate unencumbered revenue\nto the transit agency from the foreign tax treatment\nassociated with ownership of such vehicles. The decision of\nthe transit agency is whether the revenues are sufficient for\nundertaking the risk of the transaction. Certain inherent or\nperceived risks of the transaction of concern to potential\nlessees can be minimized to acceptable levels by provisions\nin the agreement.\nThe following is intended to identify some of the\ncommon concerns of lessees in cross-border leases and to\nindicate how they can be reduced while maintaining a\ntransaction acceptable to cross-border lessors.\nThe Structure of a Cross-Border Lease Transaction\nCross-border leases are very generally structured as\nfollows:\n- The foreign entity lessor borrows money from a\nbank on a nonrecourse basis;\n\n-\nNext, the entity purchases the equipment either\ndirectly from the transit agency or from the manufacturer\nwith the proceeds of the loan; and\n- Finally, the foreign entity leases the equipment to\nthe lessee transit agency. As security for the loan, the lessor\nassigns to the lender lease payments made by the lessee\ntransit agency sufficient to repay the loan.\nThe cross-border lease appears to be a real lease.\nOften title is held by the foreign entity and the transit\nagency is a lessee. Economically, however, the cross-\nborder lease puts the benefits and burdens of ownership of\nthe equipment onto the transit agency lessee, not the lessor.\nThe foregoing structure is intended to place United\nStates tax and commercial ownership with the lessee.\nBecause various foreign jurisdictions are more formalistic\nin their approach to ownership for tax purposes, tax\nownership under the laws of the lessor's country resides\nwith the lessor. It is this difference in approach that allows\ncross-border leasing to work.\nCross-border leases can be defeased or nondefeased,\ndepending on the jurisdiction involved and the financing\nneeds of the lessee:\n- In a defeased structure, the lessee will pay to an\nentity (usually a bank and frequently an affiliate of the\nlender) an amount equal to the amount the lessor borrowed\nfrom the lender. The defeasance bank will then assume\nresponsibility for payment of all obligations to the lender.\nThe lender will look only to the defeasance bank for\npayment, not the equipment.\n- A nondefeased structure is very similar to a\nleveraged lease, except that the lessee has United States tax\nownership of the equipment and, subject to the discussion\nbelow, is obligated only to repay the loan (and, if\napplicable, the equity investment of the lessor) in order to\nterminate all of the lessor's interests in the equipment.\nFollowing are a listing of the key risks to a cross-\nborder transaction and suggested approaches to minimizing\nsuch risks.\nRisks To Lessees\nThe risk: Lease termination triggering stipulated loss\npayment obligation. Typically, leases may be terminated\nupon a default by the lessee, the destruction of equipment,\nor a change in tax laws. These termination events will give\nrise to the obligation of the lessee to make stipulated loss\npayments to the lessor.\nMinimizing the risks:\nLessee Defaults--The obvious method of reducing the\nrisks of default by the lessee is to reduce the lessee's\nobligations. Depending upon the degree to which the\nlessor's jurisdiction requires the lease to resemble a \"true\"\nlease for the lessor to receive tax benefits, it may be\npossible to draft the documents so that the lessee's\nobligations regarding insurance, maintenance, and taxes are\nthe same as the lessee performs normally for similar\nequipment. In a defeased lease, the risk that a lessee will\ndefault in its lease payment obligation can\nbe virtually eliminated through financial arrangements with\nthe defeasance bank.\nDestruction of Equipment--In a defeased transaction,\ndestruction of an item of equipment harms the lessee and\nthe lessor. The lessee must make a stipulated loss payment\nand the lessor loses the tax benefits associated with\nownership of the equipment. The standards for determining\nwhether an item of equipment has been destroyed should,\ntherefore, be no more onerous than the applicable tax law\ndefinition of a casualty.\nThe risks to the parties arising upon destruction of the\nequipment can be further reduced if the lessor and lender\nwill allow substitution of equipment.\nStipulated Loss Payment--The stipulated loss payment\nis always at least equal to the loan amount. In a defeased\nstructure this amount is paid by the defeasance bank. In\nboth a defeased and nondefeased transaction, the stipulated\nloss payment also includes an additional payment to the\nlessor. The exact amount of this payment will vary\ndepending upon the circumstances giving rise to the\ntermination, the period when the termination occurs, the\nbargaining strength of the parties, and the practices under\nthe jurisdiction where the lessor is located.\nThe risk: Lessor bankruptcy. Bankruptcy of the lessor\nraises the risk that the bankruptcy trustee will treat the lease\nas a real lease and take control of the equipment for the\nbenefit of the lessor's bankruptcy estate.\nMinimizing the risks:\nReduce Bankruptcy Risk.--Lessor bankruptcy risk can\nbe reduced by using a special purpose corporation or\nsimilar entity with a low bankruptcy risk. Additionally,\nmost lessors are part of substantial organizations that have\nthe tax appetite to allow them to receive the foreign tax\nbenefits associated with cross-border transactions. It may,\ntherefore, be possible to reduce the bankruptcy risk through\na guaranty or other assurance from the lessor's parent\norganization.\nLease Termination--It may be possible for the\nbankruptcy of the lessor to give the lessee the right to\nterminate the lease. Upon such a termination, the stipulated\nloss schedule should require only a payment sufficient to\nrepay the lender and the amount of the equity invested in\nthe transaction. If the lease is defeased, this payment is\nmade by the defeasance bank and no additional payment is\nmade to the lessor. This forced sale by the lessor to the\nlessee, however, may not be enforceable against the lessor's\nbankruptcy trustee.\nStructural provisions can be added to improve the\nenforceability of this forced sale. However, the availability\nand enforceability of each such device will vary depending\nupon the lessor's jurisdiction.\nLessee Has Title--Regardless of whether any of the\nforegoing are effective to cause the lessor (or its\nbankruptcy trustee) to reconvey title to the lessee, it may be\npossible to conclude, based upon the overall transaction,\nthat for United States commercial law purposes, the lessee\nowns the equipment. If the equipment is in\n\nthe lessee's possession in the United States and the lessee\nperforms its obligations under the lease, then it will\nprobably be very difficult for the lessor's bankruptcy trustee\nto obtain possession of the equipment.\nThe risk: Defeasance bank bankruptcy\nUnless the defeasance structure is a legal defeasance\n(in which the lessee is completely released from any of the\nobligations assumed by the defeasance bank), the lessee\nwill be liable for the payments under the lease assumed by\nthe defeasance bank if the defeasance bank does not pay.\nMinimizing the risks:\nReduce Bankruptcy Risk--Most banks selected to act\nas defeasance banks are very highly rated; therefore, as a\npractical matter, the bankruptcy risk is quite low. However,\nbecause cross-border leases frequently have terms in excess\nof 15 years, a high credit rating may not be sufficient\ncomfort.\nSetoff Protection--Defeasance bank bankruptcy risk\ncan be further reduced through a setoff arrangement. The\nlease will provide that it can be terminated upon a\ndefeasance bank bankruptcy and that the lessee can assume\nthe lessor's position under the loan in lieu of making the\nstipulated loss payment. Therefore, on a defeasance bank\nbankruptcy, after assuming the loan, the lessee may be able\nto set-off against the loan obligation the obligation the\ndefeasance bank owes to the lessee under the agreement by\nwhich the defeasance bank assumed the obligation to pay\nthe lease payments.\nThe risk: Retaining tax ownership. On its surface, the\ntransaction is characterized as a sale and leaseback of the\nequipment. The lessee faces the risk that it will be forced to\naccept the form of the transaction for transfer and property\ntax purposes. If the lessee is forced to accept the form of\nthe transaction, it may be exposed to transfer taxes (such as\nsales or use taxes) and local property tax exemptions may\nbe lost. The lessee typically indemnifies the lessor against\nthese risks. If the transaction is really in substance a loan or\na sale of tax benefits, then these taxes can be avoided.\nMinimizing the risks:\nPlace the Benefits and Burdens of Ownership on the\nLessee--To ensure that the lease is characterized as a loan\nor a sale of tax benefits rather than a saleleaseback, it must\nbe possible to conclude that during the lease term the\nbenefits and burdens of ownership are retained by the\nlessee and in all events the lessee will own the equipment at\nthe end of the lease term. In a cross-border lease the lessee\nessentially has all of the rights and responsibilities of\nownership. Ensuring that the lessee will own the equipment\nat the end of the lease term is frequently accomplished\nthrough put and call provisions in the lease documents.\nThese provisions require that the lessor and the lessee make\neconomically irrational decisions in order for the lessee to\nnot obtain title to the equipment at the end of the lease\nterm. Lessees may want to obtain an opinion from their\ntax counsel or a ruling from the local tax authorities to be\nassured of the consequences of the transaction\nAvoid Inconsistent United States Tax Positions With\nLessor--The Internal Revenue Service is concerned about\nparties to a transaction taking inconsistent positions to the\ndetriment of the United States government. To avoid this\nwhipsaw risk, the lessor should agree with the lessee not to\nattempt to claim United States state or federal tax\nownership of the equipment.\nThe risk: United States withholding tax. Cross-border\nlessees will generally indemnify lessors for United States\ntax law risks. This includes the risk that the payments to the\nlessor will be subject to a United States withholding tax.\nMinimizing the risks:\nTax Treaties--Many of the countries with lessors most\nfrequently involved in cross-border leasing (including\nSweden, Germany, and France) have tax treaties with the\nUnited States that reduce the withholding rate on lease\npayments to zero. Japan's tax treaty reduces the rate to 10\npercent. Even if these treaties are amended or abrogated, it\nshould be possible to insert into the lease provisions that\nwould allow the lessee to treat the lease payments as\ninterest payments and avail itself of the statutory portfolio\ninterest exemption.\nBurdensome Buyout--To reduce the risk to the lessee\nof a change in the tax treaties, the lessor should be willing\nto allow the lessee to terminate the lease upon such an\nevent by payment to the lessor of an amount that will fully\ncompensate the lessor for the termination of the transaction.\nLegal Defeasance--If the transaction is legally\ndefeased, then the lessee can take the position that there are\nno payments being made by it to the lessor on which it\nmust withhold.\nThe risk: Local tax consequences. The lessee will\ngenerally have responsibility for United States local tax law\nrisks such as income tax, sales/use tax, and property tax.\nMinimizing the risks:\nIncome Tax--State income tax rules generally follow\nthe federal treatment of a transaction.\nSales/Use and Property Tax--Sales/use and property\ntax authorities are generally more formalistic on ownership\nquestions and particular care must be taken in transactions\ninvolving property that has already been placed in service.\nThe risk: Foreign tax consequences. Lessees are\njustifiably unwilling to assume foreign tax law risks in the\ntransaction due to their unfamiliarity with those laws.\nMinimizing the risks:\nLimited Liability--Lessors should generally be willing\nto assume the risk for changes in laws in their own\njurisdiction. One way to accomplish this is to not give the\nlessor the right to terminate the lease upon a change of law\nin the lessor's country. In a defeased transaction, this also\ncan be accomplished by allowing\n\nthe lessee to terminate the lease without any payments\nother than the defeased payments to the lender\nCase Study--Regional Transportation District (Denver,\nColorado) Cross-Border Lease\nOn December 22, 1994, the Regional Transportation\nDistrict of Denver, Colorado (RTD), successfully closed a\ncross-border lease transaction with DB Export Leasing\nGmbH (DBX), involving 11 light rail vehicles.\nThe Parties\nRTD is a political subdivision of the State of\nColorado, authorized to develop, maintain, and operate a\nmass transportation system for the benefit of inhabitants of\nthe district. RTD's boundaries generally encompass the\ngreater Denver metropolitan area.\nDBX, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Deutsche Bank\nAG, was the Lessor in this transaction.\nCS First Boston (Nederland) N.V. (CSFB) acted as\nAccounts Receivable Purchaser for the transaction. As\nAccounts Receivable Purchaser, CSFB was essentially\nacting in the capacity of lender.\nThe Project\nThe property encumbered by this cross-border lease\nconsisted of 11 light rail vehicles manufactured by Siemens\nDuewag Corporation. The equipment had a useful life of 20\nyears and an appraised value at closing of approximately\n$25 million. RTD's net benefit from the transaction\namounted to approximately 2 percent of the value of the\nequipment.\nThe Financing\nThe first step in this transaction was RTD's sale of the\nequipment to DBX This sale was accompanied by an\nacknowledgment from Siemens Duewag Corporation, the\nequipment manufacturer, that despite the sale it would not\nseek compensation from DBX for claims or disputes\nrelating to the equipment.\nThis transaction was structured as a leveraged lease,\nwith DBX financing approximately 84.3 percent of the\npurchase price of the equipment. This financing did not\nconsist of a bank loan. Instead, DBX entered into an\nAccounts Receivable Purchase Agreement with CSFB.\nPursuant to this agreement, DBX sold to CSFB without\nrecourse certain accounts receivable consisting of basic rent\nto be received by DBX under the Lease Agreement,\nstipulated loss value, and other amounts recoverable by\nDBX under the Lease Agreement. From CSFB's standpoint,\nthis structure was superior to a conventional loan.\nGenerally,\nlenders\nin\nleveraged\nlease\ntransactions\nultimately look to the lessee for repayment and treat the\nlessor as largely a pass-through entity. CSFB has a more\ndirect creditor relationship with RTD as the holder of\naccounts receivable payable by RTD than as a lender to\nDBX, with the loan collateralized by a security interest in\nlease payments payable by RTD. This\nstructure was possible because, under German tax law, this\narrangement is viewed as a loan from CSFB to DBX, and\nthe accounts receivable sale proceeds are not considered to\nbe current income of DBX.\nRTD then leased the equipment from DBX under the\nLease Agreement, which grants RTD a purchase option at\nthe end of its 18-year term. With the proceeds from the sale\nof the equipment, RTD paid its transactions costs, prepaid\nits lease obligations, and funded an escrow account to\nfinance the purchase price of the equipment on the\npurchase option date, retaining approximately 2 percent of\nthe proceeds as its net benefit from the transaction. The\nprepayment of lease payments is accomplished pursuant to\nan Assumption Agreement between RTD and CSFB. Under\nthe Assumption Agreement, RTD paid an up-front sum to\nCSFB in consideration for CSFB's agreement to pay certain\nSpecified Payments, which are defined to include basic rent\nand stipulated loss value under the Lease Agreement. By\nvirtue of entering into the Accounts Receivable Purchase\nAgreement and the Assumption Agreement, CSFB became\nessentially both the obligor and the obligee on the same\nobligation.\nThe Lease Agreement was economically defeased by\nthe Assumption Agreement, but RTD retained certain\ncontingent liabilities, including payment of the purchase\noption price. Although RTD was not required to do so,\nRTD chose to defease this liability by depositing U.S.\nTreasury securities in an escrow account held by Colorado\nNational Bank, which will have a maturity value at the end\nof the Lease term not less than the purchase option price.\nRTD's tax indemnities to DBX represented another\ncontingent liability. RTD was especially concerned about\nwithholding taxes and German Value Added Taxes.\nTypically, lessees mitigate this indemnity risk with a\nburdensome buyout option. DBX would not agree to any\nprovisions for a burdensome buyout, however, because the\nconcept was not compatible with the analysis of German\ntax counsel. Ultimately, DBX chose to accept this risk and\nproceed with the transaction. At the time, another cross-\nborder lease between DBX and the San Diego Metropolitan\nTransit Development Board was moving on a parallel track,\nwith most of the same parties and substantially identical\ndocumentation. That transaction did not close, largely\nbecause of the absence of a burdensome buyout option.\nCase\nStudy--San\nDiego\nMetropolitan\nTransit\nDevelopment Board Cross-Border Lease Financing\nIn November 1995, the San Diego Metropolitan\nTransit Development Board (MTDB) entered into a cross-\nborder lease financing in connection with the acquisition of\n97 buses.\nThe Parties\nThe parties to the transaction were MTDB, as lessee,\nJL Coronado Lease Co., Ltd., as lessor, and the Dai-Ichi\n\n_____________________________________\nKangyo Bank, Ltd., New York Branch, as lender. The\nlessor in this situation was a corporation formed under the\nlaws of Japan and the transaction was referred to as a\nJapanese leveraged lease.\nThe Financing\nThe arrangers prepared a summary of terms for the\nJapanese leverage lease, and this term sheet was negotiated\namong the parties. Upon agreement of the terms, the\nnecessary\ndocumentation\nwas\nprepared.\nThis\ndocumentation included a Participation Agreement among\nthe lessee, the lessor, the lender, and the lender's agent that\nset forth the general agreement and understandings between\nthe parties; a Lease Agreement pursuant to which the lessor\nleases the buses to the lessee; a Loan Agreement between\nthe lender and the lessor pursuant to which the lender\nagrees to loan to the lessor 73 percent of the costs of the\nacquisition price for the buses (the remaining costs are\nsupplied by the equity deposit of the lessor); and various\ncustodian and security interest agreements, including an\ninterest exchange agreement, deposit agreement, debt\nfunding agreement, deposit pledge agreement, and security\nagreement.\nThe lessor, pursuant to an assignment of the purchase\nagreement, received legal title to the buses and paid the\npurchase price of the buses to the vendor. The lessee then\nleased the buses from the lessor. One of the issues that had\nto be addressed by the parties was the ability to have title to\nthe vehicle expressed in the name of the lessor and a valid\nsecurity interest or lien on such vehicle given to the lender.\nThe appraised value of the vehicles is an important\ningredient in structuring the transaction, providing a basis\nfor the security that the lessor gives for repayment of the\nloan to the lender. A valid appraisal is one of the items\nrequired to be submitted at the closing. Another item\nrequired to be delivered at closing is FTA approval of the\nfinancing.14\nIn the documents the lessee transit agency is required\nto make certain representations. Among them is the\nrepresentation that the defense of sovereign immunity is not\navailable to the transit agency with respect to obligations\nunder the lease. This is a representation that may vary\ndepending on the laws of the jurisdiction of the lessee\nOther heavily negotiated provisions of the documents are\nthe tax indemnifications and the events of termination, all\nof which pertain to the relative risk sharing of the parties to\nthe transaction.\nFTA review is concerned with the level of fees paid to\nfacilitate a cross border lease vs the net present value benefit to the\ntransit agency In reviewing fees, the FTA seeks to ensure that total\nfees paid are less than the expected net present value benefit to the\ntransit agency FTA policy guidance for transit agencies\nconsidering cross border leasing of federally funded equipment is\ncontained in FTA Circular C7020 1\nInnovative Nature of the Financing\nMTDB had participated in prior cross-border lease\nfinancings. What made this transaction unique was\nMTDB's economic defeasance of its lease obligation.\nDefeasance of MTDB's lease obligation was not required in\nthis transaction. However, in order to minimize the risk of\nthe financing to the lessee transit agency, MTDB desired to\neconomically defease its lease obligation. The original term\nsheet for the proposed financing had specified that\ndefeasance would be accomplished through the purchase of\nB-rated variable rate corporate bonds by MTDB. Concern\nover the legal authority for such an investment and a desire\nto have a more secure, higher rated investment caused\nMTDB to request its financial advisor to propose another\nmethod by which the defeasance of its lease obligation\ncould be accomplished.\nAsset Swap for Defeasance\nMTDB chose an asset swap to defease its obligations\nunder the cross-border lease. The provider of or\n\"counterparty\" to the asset swap was National Westminster\nBank Plc, acting through its New York Branch (NatWest).\nThe asset swap used a standardized International Swap\nDealer Association, Inc., (ISDA) master agreement for a\nmulti-currency cross-border swap. The obligation of\nMTDB under its cross-border lease consisted of a set\nprincipal repayment schedule with a variable 6-month\nLIBOR rate plus 30 basis points. By the asset swap, MTDB\nmade an up-front payment derived from the lender portion\nof its cross-border lease. This payment of approximately\n$18.5 million contributed to the purchase of the assets to be\nheld pursuant to the asset swap. The assets consisted of\ncertain taxable municipal securities. These taxable\nmunicipal securities had ratings of AA or better and had\nprincipal and interest payments on a fixed basis. By\nentering into the swap, MTDB agreed to pay to NatWest\nthe upfront payment ($18.5 million), principal and interest\npayments corresponding to the principal, interest payments\non the underlying assets (the \"Muni Bonds\") and, upon\nconclusion of the swap, the proceeds from the sale of the\nMuni Bonds. In exchange NatWest, the swap party, made\nprincipal and interest payments equal to MTDB's obligation\nunder its cross-border lease financing, that is the designated\nprincipal payments plus interest on the principal at the 6\nmonth LIBOR rate plus 30 basis points. Through the swap,\nMTDB eliminated the risk of being able to invest the $18.5\nmillion at a rate sufficient to pay a 6-month LIBOR rate\nplus 30 basis points. MTDB eliminated that variable rate\nrisk and assumed the risk of the underlying credit on the\nMuni Bonds. This credit rating (AAA to a great extent) was\nmuch higher than the B-rated corporate bonds originally\nproposed for the defeasance. In addition, MTDB assumed\nrisk associated with NatWest's credit strength or continued\nliability, as NatWest was its counterparty in the swap\ntransaction. This risk in a swap is commonly referred to as\n\"counterparty risk.\"\n\nAlthough the lease defeasance asset swap that MTDB\navailed itself of to defease its cross-border lease was a\nunique instrument, transit agencies' use of the swap market\ncan be very advantageous. The difficulty of taking\nadvantage is the requirement that one have assets of a\nsufficient material value, such as the $18.5 million in\nMTDB's case study, to invest. In addition to eliminating the\nvariable rate investment risk by accomplishing the lease\ndefeasance asset swap, MTDB was able to alleviate the\nadministrative burden of monitoring and tracking the\ninvestment of the sum involved. As transit agencies face\ncontinued economic pressures, a smaller staff is required to\nperform at the utmost level of efficiency. Freeing up\nadministrative staff time for other purposes was an\nadditional beneficial side effect to the defeasance.\nV--U.S. LEASEHOLD INTEREST\nIn recent years there has been increasing interest\namong exempt entities in a leasing transaction commonly\nknown as \"leasehold interest\" transactions. The transactions\nmust comply with federal tax laws and regulations. The\nInternal Revenue Service released Revenue Ruling 99-14\non March 11, 1999, 26 C.F.R. 1.162-11, which may curtail,\nif not eliminate, the tax benefits to the equity investor in\nthese transactions. If successfully completed, the transit\nagency can realize a benefit ranging from 4 percent to 10\npercent or more of the value of the leased asset. This\nchapter describes the basics of the leasehold structure and\nsets out a checklist of issues to determine the feasibility of\nsuch a transaction.\nThe Structure of U.S. Leasehold Interest Transactions\nIn a typical leasehold structure for a U.S. lease:\n- The transit agency as the owner of equipment or\nfacilities (the \"head lessor\") leases the equipment or\nfacilities (the \"asset\") to a trustee for the benefit of a U.S.\nEquity Investor (the \"head lessee\"). This lease is called the\n\"head lease,\"\n- The head lessee then leases the asset back to the\ntransit agency (the \"sublessee\"). This lease is called the\n\"sublease,\"\n- The head lessee prepays the rent under the head\nlease in one or more installments. A substantial portion of\nthe funds needed to make the prepayments is borrowed\nfrom a lender, and the balance represents the head lessee's\nequity investment in the transaction;\n- The equity portion and the debt portion are repaid\nthrough sublessee payments under the sublease. Repayment\nof the equity portion is economically defeased through the\npurchase of U.S. Treasury securities to be held by the head\nlessee, and repayment of the debt portion is economically\ndefeased through a deposit with an affiliate of the lender\n(the \"payment undertaker\");\n- The difference between the amounts paid to the\nhead lessor under the head lease and the sum of the equity\ndefeasance and the debt defeasance represents\nthe net benefit to the head lessor from the transaction; and\n- At the end of the term of the sublease, the sublessee\nhas an option to purchase the asset at a fixed price. Please\nsee the attached charts for schematic diagrams of the\nleasehold structure and cash flows.\nKey Legal Issues: The following issues must be\naddressed to determine the feasibility of the leasehold\nstructure.\nIs the owner of the asset:\n- a nontaxpayer (e.g., U.S., state, or local\ngovernmental authority)?\n- at least A-rated or willing and able to provide letters\nof credit from banks rated AA or better?\nDoes the asset have:\n- a 20-year minimum remaining life?\n- a minimum $50 million value?\n- a fair market value, taking inflation into account,\nthat increases or at least remains stable for at least 20\nyears?\nIs the asset property that the head lessee could\nreasonably use or lease to a party unrelated to the asset\nowner? (i.e., leasing the asset back to the transit agency\ncannot be the head lessee's only commercially feasible use\nof the asset).\nDoes the existing financing of the asset include:\n- a security interest in the asset? If so, the existing\nfinancing must be prepayable or capable of being\nincorporated into the leasehold structure.\n- tax-exempt bonds? If so, it must be determined if\nthe leasehold interest will cause the bonds to be taxable.\nDo the existing contracts directly or indirectly transfer\nthe value of the asset to another party?\nThe asset must have value to the owner. Otherwise the\nvalue of the leasehold interest will be small or minimal,\neliminating the benefit of the transaction. Such a transfer of\nvalue might occur under an exclusive operating contract\nbased upon a pass-through of all costs, with no profit\npotential.\nAre there contractual or bond covenant restrictions on\nthe head lessor's right to lease or sell the asset? Does local\nlaw restrict transfers and leasing or pledge of assets or\nrequire a public bid, voter approval, and other similar\nrequirements?\nThe transit agency must have the legal power and\nauthority to lease the asset to the head lessee and to lease\nthe asset from the head lessee.\nThe transit agency must have the legal ability to\npledge assets to satisfy the security provisions of the\nstructure, including the ability to grant security interest in\nthe asset and in the deposits or payments of the payment\nundertaker, as well as the ability to indemnify the debt and\nequity participants in the transaction.\nEach transaction is tailored to the needs of the equity\ninvestor to some extent and is not amenable to bid.\n\nPublic bidding requirements may prohibit the necessary\nnegotiated nature of the transaction.\nThe transit agency must have authority to make the\npurchase of the defeasance securities and to enter into the\npayment undertaking.\nCan the deal be structured around local use, sales, and\nproperty taxes? Who bears the broken deal risks? If there\nare changes in the tax law, such as if the Section 467\nregulations are finalized, the leasehold transaction may not\nbe doable. If the transaction fails to close, the transit agency\ncould be required to pay substantial transaction costs.\nSubstantial additional property tax issues are presented if\nthe property involved is real property\nSelected Indicative Issues\nPayment Undertaker Risk-Typically, the structure of\nthe transaction contemplates having the debt defeasance\nentity (the \"payment undertaker\") make the sublease\npayments owed by the transit agency through the entire\nterm of the sublease. Any bankruptcy or other financial\ndifficulty affecting the payment undertaker could trigger an\nevent of default under the sublease with severe\nconsequences for the transit agency. In order to mitigate\nthis risk, only the most creditworthy entities are selected as\npayment undertakers. In addition, if the long-term senior\ndebt obligations of the payment undertaker cease to be\nrated at least AA- by Standard & Poor's Ratings Services or\nAa3 by Moody's Investors Service, the parties agreement\ntypically contains provisions that call for the parties to the\ntransaction to negotiate in good faith to select a new\npayment undertaker, in order to refinance the obligations of\nthe former payment undertaker, and adjust the rent\npayments, default payments, and purchase option prices\ndue under the sublease. Such refinance rights are not\nalways available, depending upon the assumptions,\nanalysis, and tax law framework.\nEvent of Loss-In order to attempt to mitigate the\nimpact of an event of loss, the transit agency may elect not\nto include one or more of its rail cars in the transaction.\nSince the leases permit, under certain conditions, the\nsubstitution of leased equipment, holding such property in\nreserve potentially acts as an insurance policy against the\npayment of stipulated loss value and other unwind costs in\nthe event any equipment is destroyed during the lease term.\nOn the other hand, the transit agency also has to forgo the\nnet benefit of including the additional rail cars in the\ntransaction.\nEvery U S. leasehold interest transaction involves\nassumptions of certain risks by the transit agency These\nrisks can be minimized by structural and drafting\ntechnique, but not eliminated. The transit agency must\ndetermine that the risks are acceptable when balanced\nagainst the economic benefit.\nCase Studies\nAlthough many of the major transit providers in the\nUnited States have successfully closed U.S. leasehold\ntransactions, the agencies we contacted declined to be\nexamined as case studies out of deference to their investors.\nVI--FARE BOX REVENUE BONDS\nIntroduction\nThe following chapter addresses fare box revenue\nbonds. Fare box revenue bonds involve the issuance of debt\nby a transit agency, which is secured by a pledge of the\nrevenues collected by operation of the transit system. Fare\nbox revenue bonds are rare due to the simple fact that most\ntransit systems operate at substantial deficits. Transit riders\non average pay less than 40 percent of transit operating\ncosts. Federal, state, and local subsidies are necessary to\nmaintain operations.\nThe Structure of a Fare Box Revenue Transaction\nFor a traditional revenue bond, such as one for a water\nor sewer system, an issuer covenants to charge rates that\nwill produce revenues sufficient to cover operating and\nmaintenance costs and debt service. Such a covenant is\ncalled a \"rate covenant.\" A \"coverage factor\" is also\ncommonly desired in which the issuer will covenant to\nmaintain revenues in excess of operations and maintenance\nexpenses by a certain multiple of the annual debt service\nowed on its outstanding obligations. Factors of 1 10, 1.25,\n1.5, or 2 times the coverage have all been used to seek\ninvestment grade ratings on revenue debt.\nTransit systems are different:\n- Because a transit system does not produce sufficient\nnet fare box revenues to cover debt service, a gross revenue\npledge is employed. A gross revenue pledge measures\ngross revenues to debt service and requires substantial\ncoverage (3 or 4 times debt service).\n- To evaluate the potential transaction, the viability of\nthe system is analyzed to determine how creditworthy it is.\nThe essentiality of the system to the local economy may be\nmore important to a credit analysis than an impractical rate\ncovenant. It will not be desirable to require an increase in\nrates by way of a rate covenant if the result of such increase\nis less riders and ultimately less revenues. What percentage\nof total commute trips are provided by the transit system?\nRate increases may also lead to less public and\npolitical support for subsidy payments What is the elasticity\nof the demand for the transit service? What are the\nalternatives to the transit system and the relative cost of the\nalternatives?\nLarge metropolitan systems with well developed\nroutes and consistent ridership levels are most appropriate\nfor fare box revenue borrowing. Even with such a transit\nsystem, other dedicated subsidy sources such as sales taxes\nor bridge tolls may be essential in order to obtain an\ninvestment grade rating on debt.\n\nKey Legal Issue: Are fare box revenues sufficient\nsecurity for a financing and does the transit agency have\nauthority to issue fare box revenue bonds? The first part of\nthis issue is a credit determination ultimately made by the\nability to sell the bonds in the capital markets. The latter\nlegal issue is governed by state law.\nCase Study--New York Metropolitan Transportation\nAuthority Transit Facility Revenue Bonds, Series 1998C\nIn December 1998, the Metropolitan Transportation\nAuthority issued $317.245 million in principal amount of\nits Transit Facilities Revenue Bonds, Series 1998C. There\nare $2.282 billion aggregate principal amount of transit\nfacility bonds of the Authority outstanding including the\nseries 1998C Bonds.\nThe Parties\nThe Metropolitan Transportation Authority, a\npublic benefit corporation of the State of New York, has\nresponsibility for developing and implementing a unified\nmass transportation policy for The City of New York and\nDutchess, Nassau, Orange, Putnam, Rockland, Suffolk, and\nWestchester counties (collectively with the city, the\n\"Transportation District\"). The Authority carries out these\nresponsibilities directly and through its subsidiaries and\naffiliates, including the New York City Transit Authority,\nan affiliate of the Authority, and the Manhattan and Bronx\nSurface Transit Operating Authority (MaBSTOA), a\nsubsidiary of the Transit Authority\nThe Project\nThe city's rapid transit system is by far the largest in\nthe nation. Only a few cities in the world have a subway\nsystem comparable in physical size and ridership. The\nsubway system has over 656 miles of mainline track\nextending 230 route miles. It operates 24 hours a day, 365\ndays a year. In calendar year 1998, approximately 1.2\nbillion revenue passengers used the subway. The Transit\nAuthority employs approximately 25,000 workers in rapid\ntransit. It currently has a fleet of approximately 5,800\nsubway cars, two major subway car repair shops, 14\nmaintenance shops, 23 subway car storage yards, and 468\npassenger stations.\nThe Transit Authority and MaBSTOA presently\noperate bus service on approximately 230 local and express\nroutes throughout the city. The majority of bus routes are\ndesigned to serve passengers traveling within a particular\nborough or to serve as feeders to the subway system. In\ncalendar year 1998, approximately 625.5 million revenue\npassengers used the bus system. Together, this bus system\nemploys approximately 13,000 persons and operates\napproximately 4,100 buses.\nTo assist the Transit Authority and MaBSTOA in\ncarrying out its role, the Authority has been authorized to\nissue bonds, payable from certain revenues and operating\nsubsidies of the Transit Authority and MaBSTOA,\nto fund a portion of the capital needs of the Transit\nAuthority and MaBSTOA. The Series 1998C Bonds were\nissued by the Authority to refund other bonds issued for\nsuch purpose.\nThe Financing\nThe Series 1998C Bonds are special obligations of the\nAuthority payable solely from and secured by a pledge of\nthe items pledged under the Transit Facilities Special\nObligation Resolution of the Authority, adopted October\n14, 1982, as supplemented. These include the Revenue\nFund into which there is to be deposited, pursuant to an\nagreement among the Authority, the Transit Authority, and\nMaBSTOA, dated July 1, 1982, as authorized by Title 9 of\nArticle 5 of the Public Authorities Law, as amended (the\nTransit Authority Act), fares collected for use of the\nsubway and bus systems operated by the Transit Authority\nand MaBSTOA, payments from concessionaires, and\noperating subsidies (not including federal operating\nsubsidies). The operating subsidies include expense\nreimbursement payments from the State of New York, the\ncity, and the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority\n(TBTA), an affiliate of the Authority. The operating\nrevenues and subsidies pledged under the Resolution are\ncollectively referred to as the \"pledged revenues\" or\n\"revenues.\"\nThe Series 1998C Bonds are on a parity as to the lien\non pledged revenues with all bonds that are, and with all\nbonds and parity obligations that from time to time may be,\nissued and outstanding under the Resolution.\nThe financing agreement obligates the Transit\nAuthority and MaBSTOA to fix or adjust the rates of fares,\nfees, rentals, and other charges for the use of the system at\nthe level required by the Resolution, which obligates the\nAuthority to cause the Transit Authority and MaBSTOA to\nadjust such rates as necessary to produce revenues, together\nwith other lawfully available moneys, sufficient to pay debt\nservice on bonds and parity obligations, maintain all debt\nservice reserve funds at their required levels, and pay all\noperating and maintenance expenses and other obligations\nof the Transit Authority and MaBSTOA as they become\ndue. This covenant is similar to a traditional revenue bond\nrate covenant with the added feature of including subsidy\npayments and other available revenues. Due to the lack of\ncontrol the Authority has over the amounts of subsidies and\nother revenues, such amounts would not have been\nincluded in a traditional revenue debt analysis.\nThe\nTransit\nAuthority\nand\nMaBSTOA\nhave\ncovenanted in the financing agreement that prior to the\ncommencement of each fiscal year the Transit Authority\nand MaBSTOA will prepare inspection, maintenance, and\nrepair programs and revise such programs, if necessary, in\norder to procure an Independent Engineer's Certificate\nstating that such programs are reasonable and appropriate.\nSuch a certificate has been furnished for each fiscal year\nrequired. The Transit Authority and MaBSTOA have also\ncovenanted to include\n\nthe cost of such programs in their annual operating budgets\nand, on or before the commencement of each fiscal year or\n60 days following the receipt of the Independent Engineer's\nCertificate, whichever comes later, to fix or adjust fares or\nother charges required to generate revenues during the\nfiscal year sufficient, together with all other lawfully\navailable moneys, to pay the debt service on bonds and\nparity obligations, operating and maintenance expenses\nincluded in such budgets, and all other obligations to\nbecome payable during the fiscal year.\nThe financing agreement further provides that if the\nactions by the Transit Authority and MaBSTOA to meet\ntheir obligations under the financing agreement are not\nsufficient to allow the Authority to meet its obligations to\nmake payments to holders of bonds and parity obligations\nand to make all required deposits under the Resolution, the\nTransit Authority and MaBSTOA shall, and the Authority\nand the Trustee may, take such actions to require the\nTransit Authority and MaBSTOA to fix or adjust the rate or\nrates of fares, fees, rentals or other charges for the use of\nthe system as shall be necessary to produce revenues that,\ntogether with all other lawfully available moneys, shall\nenable the Transit Authority and MaBSTOA to make the\npayments required under the financing agreement.\nAdditional bonds (other than refunding bonds) and\nparity obligations may be issued only if, in addition to\nother requirements, the Authority meets certain tests\nestablished under the Resolution, including the delivery of\na certificate of an Independent Engineer stating that it is\nfeasible that revenues can be derived from the operations of\nthe system so that certain coverage ratios can be\nmaintained during the current and each of the succeeding 3\nfiscal years. The Independent Engineer's certificate must\nalso state that certain historical revenues, adjusted on a pro\nforma basis as provided in the Resolution, provide four\ntimes coverage for adjusted aggregate maximum debt\nservice.\nUnder the Authority's enabling legislation, the state\npledges to and agrees with the holders of any notes, bonds,\nor lease obligations issued or incurred by the Authority,\nincluding bonds and parity obligations, that the state will\nnot limit or alter the rights vested in the Authority to fulfill\nthe terms of any agreements made by the Authority with\nthe holders of its notes, bonds, and lease obligations,\nincluding bonds and parity obligations, or in any way\nimpair the rights and remedies of such holders. The\nAuthority's\nenabling\nlegislation\nalso\nprohibits\nthe\nAuthority from filing a petition in bankruptcy under\nChapter 9 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code or such\nsuccessor chapters or sections as may from time to time be\nin effect. The state has pledged that so long as any notes,\nbonds, or lease obligations of the Authority are\noutstanding, it will not limit or alter the denial of authority\nto the Authority to so file. Similar covenants apply to the\nTransit Authority and MaBSTOA.\nThe pledged revenues of the Transit Authority and\nMaBSTOA are receipts derived from a number of\nsources that may be grouped into seven principal\ncategories: (i) fares; (ii) income from concessions and\nadvertising; (iii) fare and service reimbursements from the\ncity for certain costs incurred by the Transit Authority and\nMaBSTOA; (iv) operating subsidies provided by the state\nand the city from their general funds; (v) amounts derived\nfrom special tax-supported operating subsidies; (vi)\namounts derived from TBTA's operating surplus; and (vii)\nincome from investments and miscellaneous other sources.\nPledged revenues amounted to approximately $3.36\nbillion in 1998 (representing 21 times aggregate bond\nservice for such year). Revenues derived from fares\ncharged to users of the system in 1995 aggregated\napproximately $2.0 billion, or approximately 68 percent of\noperating disbursements.\nThe rate or rates of fares charged to users of the\nsystem are determined by the Transit Authority and\nMaBSTOA after reviewing and adopting operating expense\nbudgets. After assessing the availability of governmental\nsubsidies, the Transit Authority and MaBSTOA make a\ndetermination of the level of fares needed to operate on a\nself-sustaining cash basis. Due to the impact of fares on\nusers of the system and on the regional economy, it is the\npolicy of the Transit Authority and MaBSTOA to attempt\nto reduce costs or obtain additional revenues from other\nsources prior to increasing fares. Consequently, the amount\nand timing of fare increases are affected by the federal,\nstate, and city financial conditions and budgetary and\nlegislative processes.\nThe Authority relies on a mixture of federal, state, and\nlocal subsidies; TBTA operating surpluses; and dedicated\nspecial taxes to make up the operating deficit and fund\ncapital costs. There is an inherent tension between the\ndesires of the credit markets for a secure revenue bond with\ncustomary rate covenant and coverage and the reality of\ntransit operations, which is one of providing a public\nservice that, while in part is userbased through fee\ncollections, is also subsidized as part of the Transportation\nDistrict's infrastructure.\nThe Authority employs a rate covenant but adds to the\nfare box revenues other available revenue, including\nsubsidies to determine compliance with the rate covenant.\nThe Authority has a coverage test for the issuance of\nadditional debt, but it is a gross coverage test of certain\nrevenues at four times debt service. Therefore, the\nAuthority's fare box revenue bonds have the trappings of\ntraditional revenue bonds, but not the substance. A\ntraditional revenue bond would require net revenues\nsufficient to cover debt service. Due to the subsidy\nrequired for Transit Authority and MaBSTOA operations,\nthere are no net revenues from operations. The inability to\ndeclare bankruptcy is very unique and of great reassurance\nto investors in the deficit-prone operations. Investors have\nthe assurance that operations will continue and the\nAuthority's debt cannot be avoided.\nThere is no assurance that there is any level at which\nsystem fares would produce revenues sufficient to comply\n\nwith the rate covenant of the financing agreement in the\nevent the level of collection of dedicated taxes, operating\nsubsidies, and expense reimbursements presently provided\nfor the system were to be discontinued or substantially\nreduced. As is generally the case with publicly operated\nmass transit systems in the United States, the system has\nbeen dependent upon aid and assistance to meet its capital\nand operating needs in the past, and it is anticipated that\nthe system will continue to be so dependent for a\nsubstantial portion of such needs in the future.\nFare box revenue is not sufficient (and is never\nanticipated to be sufficient) to maintain operations and\ncover debt service and capital costs. The Transit Authority\nand MaBSTOA are dependent on governmental subsidies\nthat can get mired in the legislative process (a delay in\nadopting the state budget can result in a delay in receiving\ncertain subsidy payments and cash flow restraints), or vary\ndepending on appropriations. In New York, where the\ntransit system is vital to the economy and of a sufficient\nsize to weather recession years and a downturn in ridership,\na revenue based financing is deemed creditworthy. If the\nsystem was not as integrated into the Transportation\nDistrict infrastructure or if it did not have the historical and\ninstitutionalized financial support that the Authority\nenjoys, its access to the credit markets would most likely\nbe more limited.\nThe Authority as an issuer is unique in more than just\nthe technique it uses to finance capital improvements.\nHaving a system that generates approximately $1.9 billion\na year in operating revenues and has a fare box recovery\nratio of approximately 68 percent is unique. In addition to\nthe Authority's issuance of transit fare box bonds, the\nAuthority has issued dedicated tax fund bonds secured by\ncertain state subsidies. TBTA has issued general purpose\nrevenue bonds secured by TBTA bridge and tunnel tolls,\nspecial obligation bonds secured by regional mortgage\nrecording taxes and by TBTA net revenues on a\nsubordinate basis, and beneficial interest certificates\nsecured on a subordinate basis on TBTA net revenues. In\n1982 and 1987 the state agreed to permit the Authority to\nissue service contract bonds secured by the state's\nappropriation of debt service to finance Transit Authority\nand MaBSTOA capital needs. Being vital to a region,\nhaving a long historical existence in the infrastructure, and\npossessing accepted financial subsidies (such as the TBTA\nbridge and tunnel tolls) completes the unique nature of the\nAuthority's financing alternatives.\nCase Study--$169.5 Million Los Angeles County\nMetropolitan\nTransportation\nAuthority\nGeneral\nRevenue Bonds (Union Station Gateway Project) Series\n1995-A\nOn January 19, 1995, the Los Angeles County\nMetropolitan Transportation Authority issued $169.5\nmillion in principal amount of its General Revenue Bonds\n(Union Station Gateway Project) Series 1995-A. At the\ntime, the Authority had nearly $2.2 billion of long-term\nsales tax revenue bonds outstanding, but this was its first\nexperience with bonds secured by fare box revenues.\nThe Parties\nThe\nLos\nAngeles\nCounty\nMetropolitan\nTransportation Authority is a public agency created by\nthe California Public Utilities Code with the responsibility\nfor planning, financing, constructing, and operating the\nrapid transit system of Los Angeles County. The Authority\nprovides bus service throughout the County of Los\nAngeles, as well as portions of neighboring Orange and\nVentura Counties. In addition, the Authority operates a\nlight rail system and a subway service within Los Angeles\nCounty. The Authority was formed in 1993 upon the\nmerger of the former Los Angeles County Transportation\nCommission and the former Southern California Rapid\nTransit District.\nThe Project\nAfter the merger of the Authority's predecessor\nagencies in 1993, the need for centralized office space\nbecame acute. A study undertaken by the Authority\nindicated that annual debt service on a tax-exempt\nfinancing to construct a new headquarters building would\nbe less than the total annual occupancy costs, including rent\nand operating expenses, that the Authority would be\nincurring if it continued to occupy its current premises.\nThe Authority's new headquarters building, known as\nthe Union Station Gateway Headquarters Building, is a 26\nstory office building designed to accommodate 1,900\nemployees. The Headquarters Building includes over\n628,000\ngross\nsquare\nfeet\nof\noffice\nspace\nand\napproximately 800 parking spaces. It is located in the\nnortheast portion of downtown Los Angeles, near Amtrak's\nUnion Station depot. The Headquarters Building and\nadjacent public transit improvements to be constructed are\nexpected to serve as a transportation hub for the region,\nconnecting passengers of commuter rail, subway, light rail,\nbus, and Amtrak service.\nThe total cost of the Headquarters Building was\napproximately $145.5 million. Construction began in\nFebruary 1993, approximately 2 years prior to the issuance\nof the bonds. The Authority financed a portion of this\nconstruction with $98 million of sales tax revenue\ncommercial paper, which was retired with bond proceeds.\nThe Authority took occupancy of the Headquarters\nBuilding in September 1995.\nThe Financing\nThe bonds are special, limited obligations of the\nAuthority, payable from and secured by a prior lien on\n\"pledged revenues\" and \"remaining sales tax.\" Pledged\nrevenues are generally defined as all fare box revenues and\nadvertising revenues, together with interest income thereon,\nderived from the facilities and properties maintained and\noperated by the Authority. Remaining\n\nsales tax is generally defined as the net proceeds of the\nAuthority's transportation sales tax levied in Los Angeles\nCounty, after the payment of debt service on obligations\nsecured by such sales tax revenues on a basis senior to the\nbonds. If pledged revenues are insufficient to pay debt\nservice on the bonds when due, the Authority has agreed to\nmake such payments from any moneys available to it for\nuse for any lawful purpose, including but not limited to\nremaining sales tax and the Authority's share of certain\nstate and local transportation subsidies.\nAt the time the bonds were issued, the Authority's net\navailable fare box revenues for the most recently ended\nfiscal year (1993-94) totaled approximately $207.703\nmillion, with over 96.6 percent of that amount generated by\nthe Authority's bus service. Remaining sales tax for the\n1993-94 fiscal year amounted to approximately $439.886\nmillion. At the same time, the Authority was facing a\nbudget deficit of approximately $126 million\nThe bonds were structured as multi-mode variable rate\nsecurities, insured by Financial Security Assurance, Inc.\nThe bonds were initially issued in a weekly interest rate\nmode, with liquidity support provided by a 3-year Standby\nBond Purchase Agreement with Societe Generale. Due to\nthis credit enhancement and liquidity support, the bonds\nwere rated \"Aaa/VMIG-1\" and \"AAA/A-1+\" by Moody's\nInvestors Service and Standard & Poor's, respectively. The\nBonds received a SPUR (S&P Underlying Rating) of \"A-\",\nreflecting Standard & Poor's assessment of the Authority's\nstand-alone ability to pay debt service on the bonds.\nTo hedge a portion of its variable rate exposure, the\nAuthority entered into interest rate swap agreements with\nGoldman Sachs Capital Markets, L.P., (GSCM) and\nGBDP, L.P., (an affiliate of Grigsby Brandford & Co.\n{GBDP)). The GSCM swap had a notional amount equal to\n75 percent of the principal amount of the bonds and paid\nthe Authority the actual interest rate borne by the bonds in\nexchange for the Authority's fixed payments. The GBDP\nswap had a notional amount equal to 25 percent of the\nbonds' principal amount, and paid the Authority a floating\namount based on the PSA Municipal Swap Index. Both\ninterest rate swap agreements were scheduled to terminate\nin 10 years; the remaining 20-year term of the bonds was\nunhedged. The Authority expected this partial synthetic\nfixed rate structure to achieve a lower overall cost of\nborrowing than the issuance of the bonds as fixed rate\nobligations.\nAt the time this transaction was being structured, the\nAuthority was planning and constructing an ambitious and\ncomprehensive rail rapid transit system for Los Angeles\nCounty. The capital needs for this system were being\nfinanced with a combination of federal and state grants and\nthe proceeds of two countywide sales taxes levied for\ntransit purposes. These sales taxes secured nearly $2.2\nbillion of the Authority's sales tax revenues bonds.\nThe Authority made a policy decision not to finance\nconstruction of the Headquarters Building with sales\ntax revenue bonds, in order to preserve financing capacity\nfor planned rail improvements. The Authority's fare box\nrevenues provided the best alternative security for the new\nfinancing and were the historical source for payment of\noffice space leases.\nVarious aspects of the bonds, including sources of\nrepayment and coverage tests for additional parity bonds,\nwere formulated after lengthy discussions with the\nmembers of the Authority's financing team, the bond\ninsurer, and, in particular, the rating agencies. A significant\nsource of the Authority's nonoperating revenues consisted\nof state and federal grants, which by their terms could not\nbe pledged to pay debt service or were too unpredictable to\nbe included in the revenue pledge. Thus, FTA Section 9\nfunds are not part of the security for the bonds, and the\nAuthority's state and local transportation subsidies are not\npledged, but only made available to pay debt service to the\nextent pledged revenues are insufficient. Remaining sales\ntax is pledged to the payment of the bonds, but such\nrevenues are not deposited with the bond trustee on a\nmonthly basis, as is the case with the Authority's fare box\nand advertising revenues.\nThe Authority was willing to provide additional\nsecurity for the bonds by granting a first mortgage on the\nHeadquarters Building. The bond insurer ultimately\nrejected this collateral because of perceived difficulties in\nforeclosing against a governmental entity and the limited\nutility of such security in light of California's \"one form of\naction\" rule.\nAn important goal was to structure the Trust\nAgreement for the bonds like an enterprise revenue bond\nindenture, with the flexibility to issue additional series of\nparity and subordinate bonds secured by the same revenue\nsources. This would allow the Authority to exploit the\nmaximum bonding capacity of its general revenues at the\nlowest overall cost.\nStanding in the way of this goal was the fact that the\nAuthority's transportation system was not a traditional\n\"enterprise\" in several key respects. Like most transit\nagencies, the Authority has never attempted to set bus and\nrail fares at levels high enough to cover the cost of\nproviding the service-in fact, the Authority's operating\ndeficit for the 1994-95 fiscal year exceeded half a billion\ndollars. This deficit was covered by federal and state transit\nsubsidies and local sales taxes. Moreover, considering the\nMTA's operating deficit, elasticity of demand concerns, and\npotential political and legal considerations, the customary\nrate covenant found in most enterprise revenue bond\nindentures was determined to be inappropriate.\nOn the other hand, the Authority's fare box revenues\nhad been fairly stable over the past several years. While the\nAuthority's structural operating deficits would preclude a\nnet revenue pledge, a gross pledge could still be\nworthwhile. Finally, the Authority's historical receipts of\nsales tax revenues, as well as federal, state, and local grants\nand subsidies (aggregating over $364.295 million in the\n1994-95 fiscal year), suggested\n\n_____________________________________\n_____________________________________\nthat its transit operations would remain financially viable.\nUltimately, the structure, provisions, and general tenor\nof the Trust Agreement for the bonds reflected a hybrid of\nconcepts from both enterprise revenue and unsecured\nfinancings. There was a gross pledge of fare box and\nadvertising revenues, but no rate covenant. The Trust\nAgreement established various debt service accounts with\ndifferent priorities, but the coverage ratio for additional\nparity bonds called for pledged revenues and remaining\nsales tax to be at least equal to 300 percent of maximum\nannual debt service. This unusually stringent test reflects\nthe fact that transit revenues are volatile and not directly\nsubject to the Authority's control. In this respect, the rating\nagencies and bond insurers appeared to view the bonds as\nsomewhat less secured than general fund lease obligations,\nwhere acceptable \"coverage\" (to the extent the concept is\napplicable) for an investment grade stand-alone issue may\nindicate a general revenues to debt service ratio of 5 to 1,\n10 to 1, or greater.\nPostscript\nAfter construction of the Headquarters Building was\ncompleted, the Authority reorganized certain executive\npositions and had a change in personnel. Subsequently, the\nnew management consensus was that the remaining 20\nyears of variable rate exposure on the bonds was no longer\na prudent risk. On August 20, 1996, the Authority issued\n$185.735 million in aggregate principal amount of its\nGeneral Revenue Refunding Bonds (Union Station\nGateway Project) Series 1996-A to refund the bonds and\nterminate the related swap agreements. The refunding\nbonds were issued as fixed rate obligations, again insured\nby Financial Security Assurance The Authority has not\nissued any additional General Revenue Bonds, but this\nborrowing capacity remains available as a financing source\nfor future special projects.\nVII--STATE REVOLVING LOAN FUNDS/STATE\nINFRASTRUCTURE BANKS\nIntroduction\nThis chapter will address State Revolving Loan\nFunds.\"15 In response to states' requests for greater\nflexibility in transportation financing, Congress established\na Pilot Program for State Infrastructure Banks (SIBs)\nthrough Section 350 of the National Highway System\nDesignation Act of 1995 (NHS Act).16 Section 350\nauthorized DOT to enter into cooperative agreements with\nup to 10 states for the establishment of SIBs or multistate\ninfrastructure banks for making loans and providing other\nassistance to public and private entities carrying out or\nproposing to carry out\n15 No case studies are available for this innovation due to its\nrecent introduction.\n16 Pub L No 104-59, § 350, (Nov 28, 1995) 109 Stat 618\nprojects eligible for assistance under the Section. The\npurpose of the Pilot Program was to help DOT proceed\nwith the concept while simultaneously advancing projects.\nOf the 10 originally approved projects, nine signed\nagreements with FTA and FHWA.\nUnder provisions of the Appropriations Act of 1997\nfor the Department of Transportation,17 DOT was\nauthorized to enter into agreements with \"more than 10\nStates.\" Under the NHS and Appropriations Act provisions,\n39 states were approved by DOT for SIBs. Four of those\nstates did not have enabling legislation that would allow\nthe establishment of the banks, but 34 states have programs\nthat are in some status of implementation.\nThe Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century18\n(TEA-21) made several changes in the State Infrastructure\nBank Pilot Program. Most significantly, Section 1151\n(b)(1) of TEA-2119 reduced the number of states that could\nenter into agreements with DOT to four specific states:\nCalifornia, Florida, Missouri, and Rhode Island. Other\nstates, where SIBs were already established, may continue\nto operate those banks but there will be no additional\nfederal funds under current law. Theoretically, since the\nbanks operate with revolving loan funds, they could\ncontinue indefinitely. Further, the states may add funds\nfrom other sources.\nOther changes made by TEA-21 allow the states\ngreater flexibility in the amount of their federal highway or\ntransit funds they may contribute to the SIB, rather than the\n10 percent limit under the NHS Act. Further, TEA-21\nprovides that \"second generation\" payments or repayments\nfrom nonfederal sources be \"considered to be Federal\nfunds\" and the requirements of Titles 23 and 49 of the U.S.\nCode shall apply to these repayments.20 The NHS Act had\nno similar provision.\nThe Structure of a State Infrastructure Bank\nTransaction\nAn SIB is an infrastructure investment fund\nestablished to facilitate and encourage investment in\neligible transportation infrastructure projects sponsored by\npublic and/or private entities. Through an SIB, a state can\nuse its initial capital, provided by its federal-aid highway\napportionment, federal transit allocations, and nonfederal\nmonies to make loans, provide credit enhancement, serve\nas a capital reserve for bond or debt financing, subsidize\ninterest rates, issue letters of credit, finance purchase and\nlease agreements, provide debt financing security, or\nprovide other forms of financial assistance for construction\nof projects qualified under the federal-aid highway\nprogram and transit capital projects.\nThe revolving loan fund allows pooled vehicle\npurchases that may help reduce acquisition costs. In\naddition, it provides a mechanism for states to make loans\n17 Pub. L No. 104-205, (Sept 30, 1996) 110 Stat 2959\n18 Pub L 105-178, (June 9, 1998), 112 Stat. 107\n19 Pub. L No. 105-178, Sec. 1511(b)(1), 112 Stat 251\n20 Pub L No 105-178, Sec. 1151(I)(2), 112 Stat. 254.\n\n(with interest) or leases to transit operators who might not\nbe able to finance transactions on their own. Because the\ninterest and lease payments returned to a state's fund are\nconsidered \"program income\" they need not be returned to\nthe U.S. Treasury. The SIB can make new financial\nassistance available to other eligible projects, continually\nrecycling the initial monies, thus leveraging the initial\nfunds available. Local grantees can use subsequent years'\nrural or urban grant funds to make loan or lease payments,\nincluding reasonable interest.\nThe SIB was expressly designed to provide states with\nnew levels of financial flexibility to advance needed\nprojects. There are numerous potential approaches to\nimplementing an SIB under the Pilot Program. The chosen\napproach in each case will be influenced by state laws, the\ndesire to employ capital markets for additional financing,\nthe type of financial assistance the state seeks to provide\nthe projects, the needs of the individual projects to be\nfinanced, and a variety of other factors. While we did not\ninclude a case study for this source of financing, transit\nagencies in states where they have been authorized or\nestablished under prior legislation should explore the\npotential offered by these programs.\nVIII--CONCLUSION\nFrom these case studies we can observe that\ninnovative financing techniques can be utilized to bring\nadditional revenues to a transit agency, accelerate the\nreceipt of transit assets, or expand on a transit agency's\ncontribution to the community. Certain steps are common\nto all the techniques:\nLegal authority: Determination of state and federal\nlegal authority or legal prohibitions on the proposed\nfinancing technique is the first job that a lawyer faces.\nMany of the techniques are document intensive,\nrequiring sophisticated analysis and strategies to minimize\nthe risks involved in the transaction and to maximize the\ngain to the transit agency.\nRisk Benefit Analysis: Every financing technique,\nwhether it be novel, complicated, or customary, contains\ninherent risks that must be evaluated by the decision\nmakers of the transit agency prior to proceeding with the\nfinancing. Legal advisors may be crucial in identifying the\nrisks, describing appropriate ways to minimize the risks,\nand clarifying the options available to the transit agency.\nIt is important to have realistic goals in determining\nwhether to proceed with an innovative financing technique.\nSuch goals are not a lawyer's responsibility, but rather\nbelong to the policy makers of the transit agency. Often the\neconomic gains to be derived from a financing are\ndependent upon a number of future circumstances that are\nbeyond the control of the agency. Other policy goals may\nbenefit from or provide support for the innovative financing\ntechnique, such as low income housing, economic\ndevelopment, or acceleration of transit service delivery.\nHaving a clear understanding of the policy makers' goals\nfor the transaction assists those in structuring the deal to\nbest achieve those goals.\nThe techniques described here are not ones that can be\nfound in FTA regulations or case decisions. They are the\nproduct of transit officials with vision and innovative staff\nwho have developed these transactions. This is appropriate\nin the public arena where the expenditure of public funds is\ninvolved. Most transit agencies are risk adverse and the\nundertaking of these innovative financings was done with\ncareful consideration and an eye to minimizing the risks\ninvolved to the agency and its funds. Although glowing\nresults are not always possible, the techniques can be\nrefined, and the benefits that are available from these\ntechniques may be obtained, where appropriate, in the\ntransit community.\n\nSAMPLE STATE INFRASTRUCTURE BANK/STATE REVOLVING LOAN FUND STRUCTURE\n*Source of chart, Innovative Financing Handbook\nFederal Transit Administration\n\nAPPENDIX A--LISTING OF AGENCIES INVOLVED IN CASE STUDY TRANSACTIONS\n1.

With\nsubsidies being reduced for transit, managers are\nlooking for ways to minimize this expense without\ncompromising reliability. Governmental agencies are\nincreasingly under pressure to be more innovative in\nhow they manage the public's money and deliver\ntheir vitally needed services to their customers; many\ngovernmental entities are looking at private firms to\nsee if cutting-edge practices emerging in the business\nworld are applicable to transit.\nThe objectives of TCRP Project E-1 were to\nsurvey innovative maintenance practices being used\nin transit agencies or in transportation-related private\nfirms, to evaluate their applicability to the population\nof transit agencies in the United States, and to\ndevelop\nrecommendations\nand\nstrategies\nfor\nimplementation.\nNo specific area of focus was specified at the\nonset of the project. Work was executed in two\nphases: the first was a general survey of candidate\nnew practices; the second was a more detailed study\nof several candidates identified in the first phase of\nresearch. The candidate innovations were grouped\ninto three resource areas--capital, labor, and\ninformation.\nPHASE I RESULTS\nFollowing a literature review and site visits to\nleading transit agencies and private transportation\nfirms where innovative strategies and practices have\nbeen\nsuccessfully\nimplemented,\na\nseries\nof\nhypotheses\nabout\ninnovative\nstrategies\nwas\ngenerated.\n(See\nAppendix\nA\nfor\nadditional\ninformation on the site visit process.) These\nhypotheses were presented as potential candidates for\nPhase II work and are discussed below.\nCapital Issues\nSpares Ratios\nA\nlow\nspares\nratio\nmay\nnot\nincrease\nmaintenance costs. Initial research led to the\nhypothesis that agencies that are innovative in the\nway they maintain their fleets are able to operate with\nlower spares ratios, with resulting lower capital and\nmaintenance costs, without detriment to their service\noutput.\nInventory Management\nA well-controlled inventory will lead to smaller\ninventories (more turns, lower costs, and fewer\nobsolete parts), less parts unavailability, and\nexploration of alternatives to on-hand inventory for\nmeeting parts needs. Inventory stock purchase\naccounts for a substantial part of\nTRANSPORTATION RESEARCH BOARD\nNATIONAL RESEARCH COUNCIL\n\nmaintenance costs; there are also\npersonnel\ncosts\nfor\ninventory\nmanagement\nand\npurchasing.\nIn\naddition, running out of needed parts\nhas a cost in both maintenance\nproductivity and in providing spare\nvehicles to cover those awaiting parts.\nLabor Issues\nSpecialists Versus Generalists\nThere\nare\ndifferences\namong\nagencies\nas\nto\nthe\nlevel\nof\nspecialization\nof\nthe\nmaintenance\nworkforce and differing conclusions as\nto costs and benefits of specialization.\nAgencies that emphasize a generalist\nworkforce (one where most mechanics\ncan work on any of a bus' subsystems)\nmay\nrequire\nless\nmaintenance\nmanpower and show more flexibility in\naccomplishing a wider range of work.\nIt may also allow a more even spread of\ncapability across workshifts and ease\nthe process of on-the-job training for\nnew mechanics as they work with more\nexperienced mechanics on a wide range\nof jobs. Finally, it may provide for\nmore expertise in routine repairs\n(running repair) as senior mechanics\nare not promoted out of onvehicle\nrepair to more specialized functions,\nsuch as component rebuild.\nIn-House Versus Contract-Out\nContracting-out certain classes of\nwork is practiced by commercial\ntransportation firms, based on careful\ntradeoffs of costs.\nSome of these maintenance tasks that\nare performed on transit buses may be\naccomplished\nmore\nefficiently\nby\ncontracting out for them, rather than by\ndoing them in-house.\nInformation Issues\nDesigned\nExperiments\nfor\nEvaluating\nMaintenance Practices\nDesigned experiments can be a\nvaluable tool for evaluating proposed\nprocess\nimprovements.\nAgencies\nand\norganizations\nthat\nuse\ncarefully\ndesigned\nexperiments\nto\nevaluate\nalternatives\nwill\nhave\nreliable\ninformation with which to make\ndecisions about adopting particular\nmaintenance innovations.\nInformation Sharing\nTransit bus maintenance would\nbenefit from enhanced interagency\ncommunication. The public transit\nagencies observed differ in one striking\nfashion\nfrom\nthe\ncommercial\norganizations: they have limited contact\nwith each other apart from professional\nmeetings. In contrast, most commercial\ntransportation firms claim to have a\nwide network of contacts (many of\nwhich are with direct competitors) with\nwhom they share information fairly\nfreely.\nProcess Information and Work Planning\nCoordinating the basic set of\nprocess information with inventory\ninformation\nand\nwork\nschedule\nplanning\ncan\nlead\nto\ngreater\nmaintenance efficiencies. Management\nof any operation requires information\nabout the performance of its component\nprocesses. In particular, such data allow\nmanagement to assess the costs of old\nand\nproposed\nnew\nmaintenance\npractices.\nUpper Management Involvement\nUpper management involvement\nin maintenance can be highly beneficial\nwhen certain guidelines are followed.\nUpper\nmanagement\nattention\nto\nmaintenance (in the form of easy and\ninformal communication as well as a\ndirect reporting structure) is associated\nwith efficient maintenance operations.\nMany senior managers do not strive to\nunderstand maintenance. One result is\nthat there is little contact with or\nknowledge of maintenance procedures.\nHowever,\nagencies\nidentified\nas\nhighperforming were distinguished by\nclose\n(often informal) relations with upper\nmanagement;\nthe\nimportance\nof\nmaintenance to the agency's mission\nwas transmitted by the highest levels,\nand rigorous performance measures\nwere established and used to monitor\nperformance.\nFOCUS OF PHASE II\nPhase II of the project focused on\none particular resource input, better\nexploitation of information, and three\nof the hypotheses, with their associated\nwork plans, were selected for more\nintensive study:\n-\nInformation sharing,\n-\nExploiting\nmaintenance\ninformation for managing operations,\nand\n-\nDesigning experiments for\nevaluating maintenance practices.\nThe results of these work plans are\nsummarized below.\nInformation as a Tool in\nMaintenance Management\nObjectives and Conclusions\nPhase II targeted information\nusage as one of the most rapidly\ngrowing and changing areas of the\nmaintenance function. There are three\nfactors in this revolution:\n-\nIncreasing spread and power\nof computer technology,\n-\nExpanding capabilities for\nquickly processing data into report\nformats, and\n-\nGrowing computer networks\nwith concomitant capability to expand\ncommunication electronically.\nIt is a conclusion of this report that\ninformation, one of the three resource\ninputs for maintenance, should be a\nprimary lever for maximizing the\nThese Digests are issued in the interest of providing an early awareness of the research results emanating from projects in the\nTCRP. By making these results known as they are developed, it is hoped that the potential users of the research findings will be\nencouraged toward their early implementation. Persons wanting to pursue the project subject matter in greater depth may do so\nthrough contact with the Cooperative Research Programs Staff, Transportation Research Board, 2101 Constitution Ave., N.W.,\nWashington, DC 20418.\n\nefficient use of labor and capital\nresources.\nThe report presents analysis of and\nstrategies for using information in the\nfollowing areas:\n1.\nMaximizing the spread of\nideas\nthrough\nelectronic\ncommunication,\n2.\nImproving the use of data to\nmanage and diagnose the maintenance\noperation, and\n3.\nValidating the benefit of\ninnovations through controlled testing.\nThe\nthree\nareas\nare\nlinked.\nEvaluating the effect of changed\nmaintenance procedures requires more\neffective use of information systems,\nincluding combining and presenting\ndata in new ways to uncover hidden\npatterns.\nDissemination\nof\nand\ndiscussion about new ideas through\nelectronic communication within the\nmaintenance community are needed\nfinal tests for any new idea to become a\nnew standard in the industry.\nSPREADING IDEAS\nTHROUGH ELECTRONIC\nCOMMUNICATION\nIntroduction and Overview\nOne of the critical means for\nimproving\nperformance\nof\nany\noperation\nis\nthrough\naccess\nto\ninformation. The primary source of\nknowledge on most effective transit\nmaintenance practices is found less in\nresearch studies or even maintenance\nmanuals than it is in the collective\nexperience of its practitioners--the body\nof maintenance managers, supervisors,\nforemen, and mechanics.\nYet there are too few means for\nthis community to share the benefits of\nits\nexperiences.\nNeither\nindustry\nmeetings, nor other forms of industry\norganizations,\nnor\navailable\npublications serve to quickly transmit\nlessons learned in maintenance. The\nresult is that the abundant knowledge of\nideas and innovations being discovered\non a daily basis remains limited to a\nfew individuals.\nThe idea proposed in this section\nis\nto\nuse\nemerging\ninformation\ntechnology\nto expand the reach of maintenance\npersonnel networks as well as increase\nthe speed of information dissemination.\nAs\ndescribed\nbelow,\nthe\nmost\npromising means for doing so is via\nelectronic forms of communication.\nCommunication Constraints in\nTransit Maintenance\nWhen the 1984 Bus Maintenance\nProductivity Workshop completed its\nsessions\nin\nCleveland,\nOhio,\nparticipants were asked to name and\nrank the 12 most important issues\nraised there. The top priority was an\nimproved information network; the\nsecond priority (of 11 issues ranked)\nwas establishment of a maintenance\ncouncil, an early goal of which was to\nestablish\nan\neffective\ninformation\ndatabase\nand\nexchange\nnetwork.\nWorkshop participants had reason to\nwish for more effective information\nsharing with their colleagues, and\nbelieved that \"current methods used to\ncollect, summarize, and disseminate\nrelevant bus maintenance information\n[were] inadequate\" and \"significant\nimprovements to information exchange\ncan be made easily by applying present\ntechnologies in computer hardware and\ntelecommunication.\"\nThey\nalso\nbelieved that such improvements could\nbe made without great expense or\nlengthy implementation1.\nBecause many of the properties\nhave neither the resources nor the\nmanagement support to participate in\ndeveloping the tool, the situation has\nnot improved much since then.\nWhen asked what their main\nsource of information and advice was,\nmost\nmaintenance\nmanagers\ninterviewed cited small groups of\nfellow maintenance managers (with\nmost contacts via telephone); others\nnoted the importance of meetings, such\nas\nthe\nAmerican\nPublic\nTransit\nAssociation's (APTA) Bus Operations\nand Technology Conferences. The\nlimitations\nof\nboth\nsources\nare\napparent. Most telephone networks are\nsmall, no more than five to ten\nmanagers. While association meetings\nafford attendees greater exposure to\ntheir counterparts, the expense and\ndifficulty\nof traveling limits access for the\nmajority of maintenance personnel. The\ndependence on meetings for sharing\ninformation especially disadvantages\nsmall agencies and individuals below\nthe level of maintenance manager. In\naddition, the relative infrequency of\nsuch\nmeetings\nmakes\nthem\nless\neffective for quick dissemination of\nnew ideas and information.\nTransit is at a disadvantage when\ncompared with the private sector,\nwhere\nprivate\nfirm\nmaintenance\nmanagers highly valued and sought out\nexchanges with their counterparts from\nother firms, even to the extent of\ntrading tips (e.g., best parts suppliers).\nThe\ndensity\nand\nfrequency\nof\ncommunications appeared, at least\nqualitatively, to be greater than that\nfound in transit. Significantly, private\nfirm maintenance managers benefit\nfrom the sheer scale of many of their\noperations. The more prominent firms\nstudied--UPS, FedEx, and Ryder--are\nnational, indeed international in scope,\nand can tap employee knowledge\nworldwide.\nFedEx\nmaintains\na\ncompanywide e-mail system fulfilling\nmany of the functions the researchers\nrecommend the transit industry adopt;\nit offers an electronic means for a\nmaintenance manager in any location to\ndiscuss issues with other maintenance\nmanagers anywhere in the world. It\neven allows them to send messages to\nthe CEO.\nElectronic Communication as an\nAdditional Source for\nCommunication\nAs a supplement to existing forms\nof communication and information\nsharing,\nelectronic\nforms\nof\ncommunicating offer great promise to a\ndispersely structured industry like\npublic transit. These exchanges can run\nthe gamut from casual encounters\nbetween two individuals to postings of\nsubstantial documents for a worldwide\naudience.\nElectronic communication is a tool\nfor linking members of a community\nwith shared interests, by extending their\naccess\nto\nall\nmembers\nof\nthat\ncommunity, and by greatly multiplying\nthe kinds and complexity of\n\ninformation and knowledge they can\nshare.\nMaintenance personnel-principally\nbut\nnot\nexclusively\nmaintenance\nmanagers-are such a community and\nhave the issues in common such as:\n-\nWhat should be known about\nspecial\nmaintenance\nneeds\nbefore\npurchasing a new type of vehicle?\n-\nWhich vendors stock the\ncheapest, most reliable parts?\n-\nWhat's\nthe\neffect\nof\nincreasing mileage intervals between\nscheduled inspections?\n-\nWhen\nshould\ncorrosion\nproblems be expected in a particular\nclimate?\nIn virtually every case, someone\nelse involved in transit can answer the\nquestion. The issue is how to link the\nperson with the question to the one\nwith the answer.\nIn an organization like APTA,\nwhere a number of associate members\nare vendors, there will be sensitivity to\nthe opinions expressed in a public\nforum. Some of the legal issues are\ndiscussed below, but it is worth noting\nthat in a competitive enterprise, such as\nparts and equipment sales, all parties\ncan benefit from the free exchange of\ninformation.\nElectronic\ncommunication\nhas\nvalue to the transit industry as a whole.\nWhile aggressive steps should be taken\ntoward\nimplementing\nelectronic\ncommunication industrywide along the\nlines proposed in this section, an initial\npilot implementation, such as one\ninvolving\nthe\ntransit\nmaintenance\ncommunity, offers the best odds for\nsuccessful growth.\nAPPLYING A STRATEGY FOR\nINSTITUTIONALIZING\nELECTRONIC\nCOMMUNICATION IN TRANSIT\nMAINTENANCE\nBuilding and Defining the\nCommunity\nAdvances\nin\nelectronic\ncommunications\nare\ncreating\nthousands,\nperhaps\nmillions,\nof\n\"cyberspace\" communities around the\nworld linked via computer.\nThrough postings on the network,\nindividuals\nand\norganizations\ndetermine\nwhether\nthe\nelectronic\nenvironment offers something of value\nto them. But at the beginning, when the\nbody of listings is still limited, early\nusers may dismiss the value of this tool\ntoo quickly.\nThis problem is common with a\nfarflung community like transit (or\ntransit maintenance). A purely \"bottom\nup\" strategy by which individuals build\ntheir own connections to others in the\nindustry may not gain enough initial\nmomentum to develop beyond a small\ngroup environment to encompass the\npotentially much larger interest group.\nYet a \"top-down\" strategy may be\nequally flawed. There have been\nseveral\nattempts\nby\nleading\norganizations in transit to create an\nelectronic\ncommunication\nnetwork\nfrom above, either by creating an\nelectronic bulletin board or by creating\nhome pages, which provide regulatory\ninformation and direction to other\ninformation\nsites.\nHowever,\nsuch\nstrategies tend to benefit those already\naccustomed\nto\nusing\nelectronic\ncommunication and do little to bring in\nthe rest of the potential community.\nThere have been few attempts to\nnetwork an entire defined community,\nlike transit maintenance. While Internet\ngrowth has followed the bottom-up\npath, an alternative strategy is possible,\ncombining bottom-up and a top-down\napproaches to build the basis for an\ninclusive and networked community of\ntransit\npersonnel\ncommunicating\nfrequently via electronic means.\nGeneral Outline of the Alternative\nStrategy\nThe strategy proposed here is\nbased on combining both bottom-up\nand topdown approaches to propagating\nelectronic communication capability\nand use. In order to initiate such a\nstrategy, a framework for early use and\nrecruitment and guidance of the early\nusers needs to be executed by an\norganized body in order to overcome\nthe \"critical mass\" problem and create a\nprecedent and pattern for use of\nelectronic communication.\nAs the voice and the reflection of\nthe\nassembled\ntransit\ncommunity,\nAPTA is best placed to play the role of\nguiding organization. In order to create\na framework that gives individuals an\nincentive\nto\nuse\nelectronic\ncommunication, APTA subcommittees\nmay serve as \"nuclei\" for a self-\nsustaining electronic communications\nsystem.\nRotation of individuals among\ndifferent\nAPTA\ncommittees\nwill\nincrease\nexposure\nto\nelectronic\ncommunication and help make its use\nstandard. APTA can also facilitate and\nencourage communication in order to\nguide users through the vast array of\ninformation sources and set standards\nfor the quality of the information\nexchanged.\nFinally, the principal point of\nentry into electronic communication for\nnew users should be via e-mail (or\naliases and mailgroups). These formats\nare easy to understand and use, operate\nwithout browsers and file servers, and\nare the best tool for passing information\nthat relates to tasks needing execution.\n\"Bottom Up:\" Creating a Critical\nMass of Electronic Communication\nUsers\nThe best way of encouraging new\nusers to use electronic communication\nis to create a framework in which such\nuse is vital to their functions. Users\nmust have a reason to log on and check\ntheir e-mail, otherwise they will stop\ndoing so.\nAPTA Subcommittees as Electronic\nCommunication \"Seed Groups\"\nAPTA subcommittees have many\ncharacteristics that make them a\nvaluable starting point for spreading\nelectronic communication:\n-\nTheir\nmembers\nshare\ncommon goals and common tasks, such\nas developing agendas for APTA\nconferences and creating guidelines for\nnew practices for the transit\ncommunity;\n\n-\nThe\nmembership\nis\ngeographically dispersed;\n-\nMembership\ncovers\nthe\nextended transit community, including\nagency personnel, consultants, and\nvendor representatives; and\n-\nCommittee leaders have an\nobligation and an incentive to increase\nexchanges among the members.\nAPTA subcommittees also have\nthe advantage of covering a wide range\nof agencies and vendors. A likely\ncandidate for initial use of electronic\ncommunication might be one or more\nof the subcommittees that make up the\nBus\nEquipment\nand\nMaintenance\nCommittee (BEMC), as well as the\noverarching committee itself. In 1995,\nthere were 137 individuals participating\nin one or more of the BEMC\nsubcommittees.\nThis\nincluded\nrepresentatives from 44 agencies and\n31 vendors, as well as 7 representing\nconsultants, universities, government,\nand service providers.\nApplication\nof\nElectronic\nCommunication to Subcommittee Tasks\nPreparing agendas for upcoming\nAPTA meetings is a regular task of\nAPTA committees and subcommittees.\nThis\nrequires\nvetting\npapers,\ncommunicating\nwith\nauthors,\nand\ndeciding on final candidates. Most of\nthis\neffort\ntakes\nplace\nbetween\ncommittee meetings by telephone, fax,\nor\nother\nmeans.\nElectronic\ncommunication\ncan\nexpedite\nthe\ndiscussion and decision processes.\nAbstracts or entire papers can be sent to\nall members of the group; individual\ncomments can easily be sent back to\nthe panel chair and to all members of\nthe group.\nSome\ncommittees\nhave\nmore\ndemanding tasks. For example, the\nProcurement Task Force and the\nProcurement Steering Committee have\nas\ntheir\ncharter\noverseeing\nthe\ncomprehensive\nrevision\nof\nthe\nprocurement guidelines and technical\nspecifications contained in the White\nBook. The Steering Committee consists\nof 25 representatives of transit agencies\nand vendor organizations that are\ndispersed geographically. The\nCommittee's goal is to develop and\npublish\na\ncomprehensive\nset\nof\nprocurement-process guidelines and\nstandard terms and conditions for\ntransit industry procurements. The\ncommittee will work with several\nconsultants during the course of the\nwork, as well as solicit industry\nmembers'\nfeedback\nthrough\nquestionnaires,\nand\nhold\nfrequent\nmeetings themselves.\nSuch\na\nconcentrated\nand\ngoaloriented effort would overwhelm\ntelephone\nand\nfax\ncommunication\ncapabilities; this type of work is well\nsuited to be handled by e-mail.\nMechanics of the Implementation\nThe idea of e-mail is becoming\nmore familiar to many members of the\ntransit industry. Almost 70 percent of\ntransit agencies have networked PCs,\nwith\nthe\ncapability\nof\nsending\nintraagency\nmessages\nvia\ne-mail;\nsubstantial numbers of agencies have\nexternal e-mail capability and subscribe\nto major commercial online providers\nof electronic communications. E-mail\nprobably should serve as the first entry\npoint for electronic communication and\ncan familiarize a new user with the idea\nof electronic communication in a less\ntechnologically intimidating fashion.\nFrom there the user can advance to\nother capabilities such as browsing or\nfile transfers.\nThe\ncosts\nand\nmanagement\ndemands of implementing an e-mail\nnetworking\nof\nAPTA\ncommittees\nshould be fairly low. Initially, each\nmember would need to establish an\nexternal e-mail connection. If the\nagency or organization does not already\nprovide one, inexpensive accounts can\nbe maintained with a commercial\nprovider.\nAlias maintenance. Once all\nmembers of a networked group have\nemail\naddresses,\nparticipants\ncan\nexchange messages with any number of\naddressees, from one to the entire\ngroup. For large mailings, using e-mail\n\"aliases\" is an efficient addressing\nconvention. An alias links a simple set\nof characters to an expandable list of\naddressees. For example, an alias \"psc\"\ncould refer to the entire membership of\nthe APTA\nProcurement Steering Committee. By\ntyping \"psc\" (and a few other symbols\nto be discussed below), an individual\ncould send a message to the entire\nmembership. The alias would need to\nbe maintained; an appointed individual\nwould need to establish the set of e-\nmail addresses underlying the alias, and\nmake additions and subtractions to the\nlist as the membership changed. The\nalias would reside on the host computer\nof the alias maintainer.\nIf, for example, the psc alias were\nmaintained on the host computer at\nAPTA\n(with\nan\naddress\nlike\n\"apta.com\"), anyone wishing to send a\nmessage to the entire Procurement\nSteering Committee membership would\nsend the message to \"psc@apta.com\".\nAccording\nto\ne-mail\naddressing\nconventions, this would send the\nmessage to the computer called \"apta\"\nat APTA, and to an address inside\nAPTA corresponding with the \"psc\"\nalias. At that location, the computer\nwould be directed to disaggregate the\nnames and addresses associated with\nthe \"psc\" alias and retransmit the\nmessage to all members of the list, with\nthe entire process taking usually\nseconds or minutes.\nA host computer located at APTA\nand maintained by APTA personnel\nwould seem the most reasonable home\nfor group aliases. This would require\nthe use of a reasonably capable PC (a\nModel 486 or better) with the requisite\ncommunication software, an external\nconnectivity\naccount\n(Internet\nconnection or a commercial account),\nand one or more modems and phone\nlines. Alias maintenance would require\na fairly small amount of time from one\nindividual with moderate computer\nskills.\nCosts. Assuming PCs are already\navailable, cost should not be a\nprohibitive factor in making this system\nwork; in fact, such an e-mail network is\nlikely to lead to a reduction of costs for\ncommittee work. While prices change\nfrequently, commercial provision of\nemail capability tends to be fairly\ninexpensive. Communications software\npackages are relatively inexpensive,\ntypically under $100.\n\nCommercial accounts prices are\nnot\nonerous\neither.\nA\npopular\ncommercial provider of online services\n(extending well beyond e-mail) charges\na baseline price of $9.95 per month\nincluding\n(in\naddition\nto\nonline\nmagazines and access to many bulletin\nboards) 100 e-mail messages per month\nof up to 100 lines each; additional\nmessages would add to the cost.\nAnother commercial service, which\nprovides pure e-mail services, charges\nby the byte in a graduated fashion: the\nfirst 500 bytes costing $0.50, the next\n$0.10, and so on, with each 1000 bytes\nafter the first 10,000 costing $0.05. If a\nnormal line of text is approximately 50\nbytes, most short messages (30 to 40\nlines) would cost around $0.70. A long\nmessage, such as a 10-page document,\nwould cost $2.00 to $2.50.\nSuch costs could replace long-\ndistance telephone or fax machine\ncharges. Thus, while there are some\nstartup costs,2 the overall expense of\nusing e-mail connections is likely to be\nmuch less than with a telephone or fax\nmachine, and e-mail offers ease and\nspeed in communication.\nNatural\nGrowth\nof\nElectronic\nCommunication Networks\nExperiencing the ease of e-mail\nincreases its use. As e-mail use gathers\nmomentum\ninside\nthe\nagencies,\nemployees\nfind\nit\nincreasingly\nnecessary to their daily operations;\nthus, interorganizational e-mail use\nbuilds its own energy. As members join\nand leave committees, many may wish\nto stay linked into committee message\ntraffic whether or not they are official\nmembers. Others will want to build\ntheir own e-mail networks and their\nown aliases to link colleagues. APTA\nalso might provide alias management\ncapability for these more independent\nnetworks. When word of an interesting\nor\nuseful\ngroup\nspreads,\nmore\nindividuals ask to join. Most will\nsilently read, others will add energy to\ndiscussions. When discussion is lively,\nthe problem is not too few members but\ntoo many; discussion overload and\ndigression can become problems; the\nsolution is to\ncreate new topical groups that parallel\nthe original one.\nAt this stage, e-mail exchanges\nwill become a standard means of\ncommunication\nin\nthe\nindustry.\nEnthusiastic users will spread the word\nabout using browsing capability or file\ntransfers. As that happens, the full\nrange of electronic communication will\nbe adopted by an increasing part of the\ncommunity.\n\"Top Down\": Managing Growth and\nUse of the Network\nWhile electronic communication\nis best nurtured from below, a top-\ndown component is needed to influence\nits development. Some of the early\ndemands for top-down management\nhave already been mentioned; they\ninclude establishing a clearinghouse for\ninformation to get the new user started;\nmaintaining committee aliases; and\ninstalling a \"switchboard\" computer to\nmove e-mail to the right destination.\nThis subsection discusses some of the\nmain functions of the \"top-down\nmanager.\"\nAPTA as a Top-Down Manager\nAPTA, as the voice of the transit\ncommunity, is the natural candidate to\nfacilitate\nelectronic\ncommunication\namong its members and beyond.\nBecause many of APTA's operations\nare aimed at increasing communication\namong its members (e.g., APTA\nconferences)\nor\nat\ndisseminating\ninformation to the membership (e.g.,\nthe \"Thursday mailings\"), managing\nthe\ngrowth\nof\nelectronic\ncommunication is a natural extension\nof APTA's function.\nMajor Functions of\nTop-Down Management\nThere is a variety of services a\nmanager should provide and the list\nwill change as the technology of\nelectronic communication changes.\nEstablishing nuclei involvement.\nAPTA\nshould\nencourage\nmaking\nelectronic communication the standard\nmeans of communication among its\nsubcommittees and other panels; it\nshould provide technical expertise for\nnew members; it should maintain the\nmailing aliases.\nMaintaining directory services.\nAs the number of users increases, one\nemerging difficulty is the lack of\ndirectory services. Directory services\nare still primitive on the Internet, and\nearly attempts to create the equivalent\nof long-distance telephone directory\nassistance have been disappointing.\nThe best way to get an e-mail address is\nstill to ask the person for his or her\naddress.\nAPTA can maintain a directory of\ne-mail addresses for members of the\ntransit community and put them in an\neasily\naccessible\nformat.\nSuch\na\ndirectory\ncould\nbe\na\nrelatively\nsophisticated\nsearching\nmechanism\n(which could allow a search for the\nnames and e-mail addresses of agency\nmaintenance managers) or it could be\nan\nalphabetized\nlist\nwith\ne-mail\naddresses and titles of all members of\nthe directory.\nManaging aliases. APTA may\nchoose to provide alias management\nservices along the lines discussed\nearlier. If non-APTA related groups\nwish to establish a mailgroup alias,\nAPTA may offer its services for\nmaintaining the alias in its own\ncomputer and providing a routing\nservice for messages. This would\nfacilitate APTA's development of a\ntransit e-mail directory.\nEstablishing\nand\nmanaging\nbulletin boards. While many of the\nelectronic\nconversations\nwill\nbe\n\"private\" (read only by subscribers to\nthe alias or the mailgroup), there is\ngreat value in having discussions that\nall can read or contribute to. This is one\nof the functions that electronic bulletin\nboards and newsgroups provide. It\nwould be of particular value for APTA\nto establish and maintain some bulletin\nboards on a variety of topics; these\ncould act as a continuous \"town hall\"\nfor matters of interest to the transit\ncommunity. One could imagine a\nbulletin board on the White Book\nrevisions, providing feedback from the\ncommunity at large to those making\nrevisions, or discussions about desired\naspects of the advanced technology\nbus, or the benefits of brake retarders,\nor\n\nspecific\nintervals\nfor\npreventive\nmaintenance. The advantage of bulletin\nboards is that they are accessible to all\nand can be read at the individuals'\nconvenience, without the postings\noverwhelming their electronic mailbox.\nAPTA, in managing these bulletin\nboards, could sponsor their startup,\nsolicit ideas for topics and vote on\nwhether they should be initiated3.\nProviding a clearinghouse for\nbrowser resources. One of the most\nfrustrating things for new users is the\nformless,\nunedited\nnature\nof\nthe\nInternet,\nespecially\nthe\nbrowser-\naccessed World Wide Web. There is no\nreliable guide to what exists in\ncyberspace nor is there a mechanism to\nguide the users. Perhaps one of the\nmost valuable roles an organization like\nAPTA can do for an emerging\nelectronic community is to act as a\nguide to the information available.\nAPTA can serve as a reference librarian\nto the resources that the community\nputs on the Internet. APTA might\nconsider taking the following actions:\n-\nMaintaining the APTA home\npage on the World Wide Web that, in\naddition to providing information about\nAPTA itself, serves as a gateway to\ntransit-related resources elsewhere in\nthe Web. (An APTA home page has\nalready been established and provides\naccess\nto\nthe\nkinds\nof\ntransit\ninformation recommended here. It is\naccessible\nthrough\nthe\nfollowing\naddress: http://www.apta.com).\n-\nEncouraging other potentially\ninterested parties to establish home\npages; these might include vendors\ndisplaying information about current\nproduct lines, price lists, updates to\ntechnical bulletins and maintenance\nmanuals and the like; agencies listing\njob\nopportunities\nor\nposting\nexperiences\nwith\nparticular\nmaintenance problems; or government\nagencies\nproviding\nupdates\nto\nregulations;\n-\nProviding an organized way\nof accessing all of these resources via\n\"onestop shopping\" through the APTA\ngateway; and\n-\nProviding\nannotations\nto\nguide users in searching the various\nhome\npages. However, such annotations\nwould have to be updated fairly often.\nBeing a technical advisor of the\nlast resort. Finally, APTA should\nstrongly consider offering technical\nhelp to its members. Although using e-\nmail is becoming easier all the time,\nnew users may still find themselves\neasily thwarted by startup problems.\nAPTA might offer some of the\nfollowing resources:\n-\nHard or soft copy information\npackages to help new users get started;\n-\nAn 800 telephone number for\ntechnical advice;\n-\nPackage\ninformation\nand\ncosts; and\n-\nLast-resort\nsubsidies\nfor\nmember operating costs.\nConclusions and Steps for\nImplementation\nFor the transit community, the\nissue of joining the world of electronic\ninformation sharing is a question of\n\"when\" not \"if.\" This section points out\nthat\nthe\nstrategy\nfor\ndeveloping\nelectronic communication can help or\nhinder its development. A useful\nimplementation strategy is one based\non creating seed groups exchanging e-\nmail to handle ongoing business among\ndispersed members of the transit\ncommunity, aimed at familiarizing\nmembers with the benefits of electronic\ncommunication\nand\nenhancing\nits\nspread industrywide.\nA top-down element is essential to\nthis strategy, recognizing that some\nlevel of guidance is required to ensure\nquality standards for the information\nexchanged. APTA is positioned best to\nplay this role.\nFor\nthat\nimplementation\nto\nsucceed, several steps need to be taken:\n-\nVolunteering\nspecific\ncommittees or subcommittees to act as\nseed groups, including the agreement of\nall members to acquire connections,\nfamiliarize\nthemselves\nwith\nits\noperation, and commit to using the\nchannel as the situation demands;\n-\nDesignating\nAPTA\npersonnel, hardware, and software\nnecessary to\nsupport committee and subcommittee\nuse of electronic links;\n-\nDeveloping a larger and\nlongerterm APTA plan to support\nelectronic\ncommunications\nin\nthe\ntransit\nindustry,\nincluding\ne-mail\naddress directories, alias management,\nhome-page\ncoordination\nand\nannotation, and preparation of tutorial\npackages for new users;\n-\nDisseminating APTA plans\nto\nthe\nmembership\nto\nfacilitate\nindependent\nefforts\nto\ndevelop\nelectronic links in coordination with\nAPTA efforts; and\n-\nSoliciting\nvendor\nand\ngovernmental\nparticipation\nin\nelectronic links, especially through\nhome pages, for access through an\nAPTA gateway.\nAs\nimplementation\nproceeds,\nongoing research by consultants or by\nAPTA personnel can play a valuable\nrole in analyzing emerging usage\ntrends, evaluating network problems\nand\nweaknesses,\nand\nsuggesting\ncorrective actions.\nIn conclusion, it is important for\nthe transit community to be proactive.\nThe transit industry needs to lead rather\nthan follow in adopting the electronic\ncommunication standard. The resulting\nproduct will be better suited to transit\npersonnel\nuse,\nand\nits\nadoption\nthroughout the community will spread\nquickly.\nUSING INFORMATION TO\nSUPPORT MAINTENANCE\nDECISION MAKING\nMaintenance Information and Data\nWhen the collection of data on\nmaintenance\nprocesses\nand\nmaintenance information systems is\ndiscussed,\nthe\nterms\ndata\nand\ninformation are used interchangeably.\nFor the purposes of this section, the\nfollowing distinction between the two\nis made.\nData are the individual numbers,\ncodes, text, and so on, selected by\nmechanics, hustlers, and managers to\ndescribe what they did or found during\nthe course of a maintenance action.\nAmong the transit agencies and other\n\norganizations visited in Phase I and\nPhase II site visits (Appendixes A and\nB summarize these site visits), there is\ngeneral agreement on a common core\nof data elements that need to be\ncollected for maintenance management.\nThe\ncomputer\nhardware\nnow\ncommercially available has sufficient\npower and storage capacity to collect\nand retain this core data easily for most\ntransit\norganizations\n(most\nhave\nadequate computer capability, though\ntheir\nmaintenance\norganization\naccessibility is limited). There have\nbeen advances in data capture devices:\nbar code readers, magnetic card swipes,\nruggedized input devices (keyboards\nand touch screens), and computers on\nvehicles and individual components.\nCommercial attention has focused on\nthe use of such devices to ensure the\nquality of collected data, particularly by\neliminating errors that occur when\npaper forms are used for collection.\nThere is increasing interest in data\nelements beyond the basic core, e.g.,\nserial-number tracking of components\nfor lifetime estimation and evaluation\nof suppliers, but the benefits of these\nelements are debated.\nHowever, data are useless if they\nare simply stored and never looked at\nagain. The purpose of data collection is\nto\nproduce\ninformation,\nthe\ncombination and display of data to\nilluminate some aspect of maintenance\npractices, evaluate possible actions, or\nsuggest\nalternatives.\nBoth\ndata\ncollection and information production\nare\ncritically\ndependent\non\nthe\ncapabilities of computer technology\nand one's function is often confused\nwith the other's.\nAlthough there is a core of\nmaintenance\ndata\nelements,\nthe\ncombinations of those data and the\ninformation potentially available are\ninfinite.\nTherefore,\ninformation\nproduction needs to be tailored to the\ncircumstances\nand\nits\nparticular\nproblems to be useful. While fields\nsuch as statistics and graphical design\ncan suggest methods of analyzing data\nto extract information, the value of\ninformation production can be judged\nonly by information use, and the\nbenefits of use can be assessed only\nthrough the experience of maintenance\norganizations.\nIdeas for information production need\nto be tested on real problems.\nThe use of post processors is an\nemerging\nstrength\nof\nthe\nmore\nadvanced\nmanagement\ninformation\nsystems. Post processors facilitate the\nmanipulation of data for any desired\npurpose. Some systems even allow data\nto be downloaded for use onto other\ncomputer\napplications\nlike\nspreadsheets.\nWith\nthese\nnew\ncapabilities, maintenance managers will\nbe able to track, troubleshoot, and\ncontrol their operations even more\neffectively than through advances being\nmade in the areas of data collection or\ndata coding.\nMaintenance Information Usage in\nCommercial Firms\nPhases I and II of the project\nincluded visits to facilities and offices\nof six commercial firms that operate\ntransportation fleets: FedEx, Arkansas\nBest Freight (ABF), Laidlaw, American\nPresident Lines (APL), Ryder Leasing,\nand United Parcel Service (UPS). A\nsummary of some of the innovations in\nthe collection and use of maintenance\ninformation\nused\nby\nthese\nfirms\nfollows, along with a comparison of\nthose used in mass transit. First, the\noverall approach to maintenance data\ntaken\nby\nthese\norganizations\nis\ndescribed, then the innovations of two\nof these firms in using information to\ndevelop their maintenance operations\nare examined.\nAll the firms visited were very\nlarge and had maintenance centers\nspread over a wide geographical area.\nAlmost all the centers were the size of a\nmoderate bus agency in terms of\nnumber of vehicles; the vehicles were\nsomewhat less complex. The amount of\ncontrol of the centers, particularly in\nmaintenance policies, ranged from\nvirtual autonomy at APL to detailed,\ncentralized\ncontrol\nat\nUPS.\nMaintenance was seen in each firm as a\nkey part of their business because each\nhad low spares ratios and operated on\ntight schedules with heavy demands.\nAll the commercial organizations\nconsidered their maintenance data an\nasset that helped them make their\nmaintenance\noperations\nmore\ncosteffective. This was reflected in the\nbelief\nthat data collection was part of the job\nof mechanics and foremen, not a\nsecondary task to \"real work.\" With the\nexception of UPS, this realization had\noccurred fairly recently, and all the\nfirms were in the process of upgrading\nboth their maintenance data collection\nand the provision of information for\nmaintenance\nmanagement\nto\nmechanics, foremen and maintenance\nmanagers.4 These organizations were\nsimilar to public transit agencies in\nterms of maintenance management\nuntil the early 1990s (in fact, some of\nthe large transit agencies may have\nbeen ahead of them in terms of\ncomputerization).\nHowever,\nthe\nresources that these firms command\nhave allowed them to move rapidly in\ndeveloping and installing state-of-the\nart maintenance information systems.\nFor example, Ryder went from a paper\nsystem at its maintenance centers to\nFastTrack5 in 3 years.\nThere are two other differences in\nthe use the commercial firms made of\nmaintenance\ninformation.\nFirst,\nbecause of their size, most had decided\nto\ncentralize\nanalysis\nof\ntheir\ninterregional data. This function was\nlong standing at UPS; the other firms\nwere\nconsidering\nthis\nto\nbenefit\ncollection of local data (during our\nvisits to the corporate headquarters of\nRyder and FedEx, this development\nwas presented as a key part of their\nmaintenance information strategy).\nSecond, although the commercial\nfirms planned to use their maintenance\ndata to improve their maintenance\npractices, they all saw the biggest\npayoff\nto\nbe\nmore\ninformed\nprocurement decisions. In their view,\nthe primary driver of maintenance costs\nis the design and manufacture of the\nvehicle,\nand\nthey\nplanned\nto\naggressively use the maintenance data\nto pursue warranty claims, guide the\ndevelopment of engineering changes\nand\npurchase\nspecifications,\nand\nevaluate the performance of different\nmakes\nof\nvehicles\nand\nmajor\ncomponents.\nAlthough the commercial firms\nshare similar views on the above issues,\nthe researchers observed that there was\na difference among the firms visited in\nhow they were using maintenance\n\ninformation. One set of firms took a\ndiagnostic approach to the use of\nmaintenance information. Their\ninformation is focused on vehicles:\nkeeping track of repairs, PM and safety\ninspection schedules, parts usage, and\nreporting this information to the\nmaintenance manager and higher levels\nas needed. The management of the\ncenter is much less formalized, with\nmanagers and foremen using their own\njudgment to assign work and assess\nmechanic performance. Maintenance\ninformation is used primarily for the\ndiagnosis of persistent problems with\nvehicles, and, to a lesser extent, with\nmaintenance\nprocesses.\nThe\nmaintenance information system is\nimportant to day-to-day maintenance\noperations, but not vital. The firms in\nthis group are FedEx, ABF, Laidlaw,\nand APL.\nIn contrast, Ryder and UPS have\nmaintenance operations which are\ninformation-organized. In addition to\nusing maintenance information in a\ndiagnostic fashion, information about\nvehicles, mechanics, and schedules is\nused to make management decisions\nabout\nrunning\nthe\nmaintenance\noperation.\nBoth\nRyder\nand\nUPS\nschedule maintenance jobs and assign\nmechanics based on job priorities,\nmechanic qualification and skills, and\navailable space. The UPS system also\ninsures that the correct parts will be on\nhand for scheduled PM and deferred\nmaintenance before a vehicle is brought\nin for work. For these firms, the\nmaintenance information system is\ncritical to day-today operation.\nInformation-organized\nmaintenance\nuses\ninformation\nto\nminimize work which is not direct\nrepair work, whether mechanic or\nsupervisor, particularly administrative\npaperwork. To get accurate information\nto do this, both firms have used\ncomputers to reduce the data collection\nburden, even when the initial cost for\nhardware and software development is\nhigh. Both Ryder and UPS have\nbrought together all the resources\nrequired for the mechanic to do a repair\njob through completion without delay\n(Ryder has integrated its diagnostic\nequipment and is developing online\ntechnical manuals that can be\naccessed by a laptop computer as the\nmechanic works).\nThe success of both Ryder and\nUPS in their use of the information\nsystem in scheduling maintenance and\nmoving administrative tasks, which\nensures that all resources needed for a\nrepair job are brought together at the\nright time, suggests that maintenance\ninformation use can be pushed beyond\ndiagnosis to a more central role in\nmanaging maintenance.\nFindings\nNo hard or fast rules exist for the\nuse of information in maintenance\nmanagement; the value of information\nis determined by the situation and the\npersonal\napplication;\nhow\nit\nis\nmanipulated and presented is similarly\nsituation dependent.\nThe research conducted in this\nproject indicates that the capabilities\nand much of the content of most\nmaintenance management information\nsystems\nin\npublic\nand\nprivate\norganizations\nare\nsimilar.\nComputerization is the rule. The\nmajority of agencies maintain vehicle\nwork histories and are for the most part\nwork-order based. Mileage, fluids\nconsumption, and cost tracking (to\nsome degree) are typical, and most\nagencies investigated can generate\nstandard performance measures, such\nas miles between roadcalls and cost per\nmile.\nThere is a lack of standardization,\nespecially in the area of codes. There is\nno equivalent in transit to the American\nTrucking Association's (ATA) Vehicle\nMaintenance\nReporting\nStandards\n(VMRS). The ATA codes describe the\nvehicle, problems, action taken by\nwhom and where, and at what cost.6\nSuch a system, if modified to fit the\ncharacteristics of transit vehicles, could\nbe of great use to transit maintenance\nmanagers. However, consideration of\nany type of industry standards for\nmaintenance data must be preceded by\nconsideration of how such data would\nbe used.\nThe research revealed that many\nagencies collect subsystem, failure, and\nrepair-coded information, and that\nthese coding systems are undergoing\nsubstantial modification to enhance\naccessing data. However, we also\nfound very limited use of many of these\ncodes, especially failure and repair\ncodes. Subsystem codes, on the other\nhand, were often profitably exploited,\nbut there was great variation in their\nuse across the agencies. In some cases,\na failure code of special interest, such\nas the \"No Trouble Found\" code, was\nfrequently included in performance\nmeasurement, but few if any other\ncodes were so employed.\nIn opening the discussion of how\nbest to use information to support\nmaintenance\nmanagement\ndecision\nmaking, it was found that most\nagencies are already well-positioned to\nmake good use of existing data\nresources\nwithout\nsettling\non\nan\nindustry\nstandard\nor\npursuing\nexpansion\nof\ndata\ncollection\ncapabilities. The power of information\nexploitation flows as much from\nmethods of combining and presenting\ndata as from the volume of collected\ndata itself.\nTo demonstrate this, a series of\nexamples was presented based on\ncurrent uses of data among agencies\nthat illustrate ways of bringing together\ndifferent data elements and presenting\nthe results to answer questions, convey\ninformation,\nand\nsupport\nthe\nmaintenance decision maker in the\nsimplest, clearest way.\nIn a comparison of public transit\nagencies\nand\nprivate\ntransportationrelated firms, there were\nfew differences found in data uses for\ndiagnostic purposes. However, several\nfirms studied are using data to create\ninformation-based\nmaintenance\noperations that are very different from\nanything seen in transit. Organizations\nlike\nUPS\nand\nRyder\nare\nusing\ninformation to schedule all aspects of\nthe maintenance operation. Needed\nrepairs are noted during inspection and\nset up for future repair. Mechanics are\nassigned, and their daily schedule laid\nout for this scheduled work, based on\ncarefully maintained shop standards.\nRepair\npart\nrequirements\nare\ndetermined during the inspection phase,\n\norders are placed, and parts delivered\nwithin the time frame of the repair.\nMaintenance work organized with\nsuch detail and close control generates\nbenefits for these firms but clearly\nincreases\ntheir\ndependence\non\ncomputerbased management systems\nand the personnel who need to run\nthem, generate the schedules, and\ncoordinate\nthe\nexecution\nof\nall\nactivities. The systems also require\nrealistic\nshop\nstandards\nto\nwork\nefficiently. Adopting such systems\nwould be a substantial undertaking for\ntransit agencies but, if budget pressures\ncontinue, one worth considering.\nTESTING INNOVATIONS\nTHROUGH EXPERIMENTAL\nDESIGN\nPurpose\nIs an innovation in maintenance\npractice worthwhile? Will its potential\nbenefits outweigh its costs? In most of\nthe agencies visited, the procedure for\nevaluating changes to maintenance\npractices is based on informal tests. In\ncontrast,\nin\nareas\nsuch\nas\nmanufacturing,\nagriculture\nand\nmedicine, evaluations are planned and\nexecuted through designed experiments\nthat\nensure\nvalid\nresults.\nThese\nexperiments are described in this\nsection. The use of such experiments in\nthe context of fleet maintenance can\nbenefit the industry by speeding up\nevaluation and spreading the use of\ninnovative\npractices.\nThis\nsection\nprovides ideas about how experiments\ncan be useful to transit maintenance\nand suggestions and references for\nfurther information.\nEvaluation of New Maintenance\nPractices\nThere is increasing pressure in the\ntransit industry for agencies to improve\ntheir performance in all areas, including\nmaintenance. Agencies are expected to\nproduce more with fewer resources and\nto increase their productivity and\nefficiency. Exploring new maintenance\npractices is a key tool.\nBefore adopting a new method for\nall vehicles, it is often tested in a pilot\nprogram. The reason for using a pilot\nprogram is to measure the amount of\nimprovement gained. If the new\ntechnique has harmful effects, it is\ncritical to discover these before the\ntechnique is applied to the entire fleet.\nIf the new method is more costly than\nthe old method, a manager needs to be\nconfident that the improvement in\nmaintenance performance will save\nmore money than the cost of the\ntechnique.\nMany\ninnovations\nhave\nbeen\nadopted by different agencies. These\nincluded brake retarders, the use of oil\nanalysis, new tools for repairing and\ncleaning a bus, alternative fuels, and so\non. However, these innovations have\nnot diffused uniformly through the\nindustry. In the cases of both brake\nretarders\nand\noil\nanalysis,\nsome\nagencies insisted that these were\nvaluable\ninnovations\nthat\nsaved\nsubstantial\nresources,\nwhile\nother\nagencies\ninsisted\nthat\nthe\nsame\ntechniques were not worth their cost.\nSimilarly, it has often been pointed out7\nthat preventive maintenance schedules\ndiffer widely among agencies, even\nwhen they have similar equipment and\nenvironments.\nWhen asked how changes were\nevaluated, the answer was virtually the\nsame from all agencies: new techniques\nwere tried out on a small set of\nvehicles, and if there were no problems\nand the relevant performance was\njudged to have improved, the technique\nwas adopted for the entire fleet.\nHowever, there was little recorded\nabout how the vehicles were selected or\nhow the performance was evaluated;\nexperienced people picked the vehicles\nand \"looked at\" the results.\nThere are two problems with this\nevaluation procedure. First, there is\ninherent variability in measuring any\nperformance metric: fuel mileage, oil\nusage, miles between roadcalls, all\ndiffer between vehicles for a variety of\nreasons including route, driver, bus\nmake, and even characteristics of the\nparticular bus. If vehicles are not\nselected to be representative of the\noverall fleet, and comparisons are not\nmade carefully, this variability can\neither obscure the effect\nof a good idea, or indicate that a new\nprocedure is beneficial when it has no\neffect. Second, the informal procedures\nfor testing render the results from most\ntests suspect from one agency to the\nnext: without a clear picture of what\nwas done, concerns relevant to an\nagency considering the new technique\ncould not be addressed without running\nseparate tests at the new agency.\nHowever,\nindustry\nhas\ncarefully\ndesigned and carried out such tests,\nthough maintenance organizations in\nthe transit industry have yet to avail\nthemselves of their benefits. The\nadoption of these techniques for\ndesigned experiments provides an\nimportant tool for transit maintenance\nto\nevaluate\naccurately\nproposed\nchanges in maintenance procedures.8\nDesigned Experiments\nA designed experiment is a\ncarefully structured test that uses\nstatistical\nmethods\nto\nestimate\naccurately the changes produced by the\ntest. Such tests are particularly useful in\nsituations where there is substantial\ninherent variability, that is, response is\naffected by a variety of factors.\nDesigned experiments allow the two\ntypes of effects on test response to be\nseparated and measured so that the\neffect under study can be accurately\nassessed.\nModern\ninterest\nin\ndesigned\nexperiments dates to the early twentieth\ncentury agricultural experimenters who\nneeded to show the effect of new\nfarming methods on crop yields, but\nhad to contend with the variations of\nyield due to different fields, slight\nvariations in planting practices, and\nother factors. These methods were\npicked up by manufacturing firms,\nparticularly those in the food and\npetrochemical industries. After the end\nof World War II, the techniques were\nintroduced into Japanese industry by\nthe American statistician W.E. Deming\nand helped revolutionize Japanese\nmanufacturing by applying designed\nexperiments to virtually every proposed\nimprovement\nin\nmanufacturing\nmethods. Similar techniques need to be\n\nemployed in transit to help separate the\nvariability\nintroduced\nby\nseasonal\ntemperatures, speeds, passenger loads,\nand age from the actual effect of\nchanges to maintenance procedures.\nDesigned Experiments in\nMaintenance\nMaintenance has lagged behind\nproduction in many parts of industry in\nthe use of designed experiments. The\nreasons are not clear, but may include\naversion to risk in carrying out tests on\na significant portion of a fleet (this is a\nspecial concern in mass transit) and\nsignificantly more variability in the\nrepair process (compounded with each\nrepair) than in a manufacturing process.\nThe result is that new methods in\nmaintenance are evaluated by small,\ninformal tests. However, such tests\nhave a number of problems, which can\nobscure or distort the effect of\nsignificant improvements.\nBasic Concepts of Experimentation\nThere are three basic concepts of\nexperimentation that determine the\ndesign of experiments.\nThe first concept is variability, the\ndifferences in any measurement from\nvehicle to vehicle. For example, gas\nmileage or brake lining life varies from\nvehicle to vehicle or on the same\nvehicle over time. Some of the causes\nare known, such as size, route, or\ndriver. But some of the causes are\nunknown or random (even with the\nsame route and driver, mileage and\nbrake life are not constant from\nmeasurement to measurement). The\nmost important consequence of this\nconcept is that tests need to be done on\nmore than one vehicle. The actual\nnumber needed depends on the amount\nof variability; with more variability,\ntests on more vehicles are required to\naccurately estimate the effect of some\nchange\nin\nmaintenance.\nDesigned\nexperiments\noffer\nmethods\nof\ndetermining the number of vehicles in\nthe test so that the test will detect any\nmeaningful\neffect\nfrom\nthe\nmaintenance innovations.\nThe\nsecond\nconcept\nis\nrepresentativeness, the extent to which\nthe vehicles tested are like the other\nvehicles in the fleet. Eventually, the\ninnovation under testing will be applied\nto the entire fleet. If the vehicles in the\ntest differ significantly from those in\nthe fleet (e.g., newer, older, on easy or\nchallenging routes) it is much harder to\nargue that the results from the test can\nbe applied to the fleet as a whole. In\ndesigned experiments, vehicles are\nrandomly selected from the fleet to\nprovide a set of test vehicles.\nThe third concept is controls.\nWhen a new method is tested on one or\nmore transit buses, an improvement can\nonly be measured relative to buses on\nwhich the method has not been tested.\nFurther, the comparison buses must be\nlike the tested buses, except for the\napplication of the new maintenance\nmethod. For example, buses compared\nshould\nbe\nthe\nsame\nmake,\nor\nmaintained in the same garage, or run\non similar routes, otherwise the effect\nof the new method can be confused\nwith the effect of the difference in the\nvehicle or its environment. This is a\nfundamental point, but one which is\nignored in many testing situations.\nExperimental design is a set of\nmethods, primarily statistical, which\ntakes the effect of all three concepts\ninto account and sets up a test that has\ngood controls and enough test vehicles\nto accurately estimate the effect of a\nnew maintenance innovation. Designed\nexperiments can show how to select\ncontrols so that variability and the\nnumber of vehicles required is reduced,\nsaving time and money on the test\nwithout\nsacrificing\naccuracy.\nStatisticians have developed these\nmethods to address a wide range of\npractical situations.\nProblems with Informal Testing\nThe\nproblems\nwith\ninformal\ntesting are listed below:\n-\nThe number of buses to test\nmay not be sufficient to make an\naccurate quantitative assessment of the\nvariability in effect to be expected or\nthe\nsize of improvement that needs to be\ndetected.\n-\nWhen improvement in the\ntest fleet is assessed informally, the\ncontrol group is rarely scientifically\ndefined and the bus fleet may differ\nsubstantially from the test buses.\n-\nLack of randomization means\nthat\nother\nfactors\naffecting\nthe\nimprovement may have not have been\nadequately balanced between the test\nand controls.\nThe result is that whether an\nimprovement is seen in the test buses or\nnot,\nit\nis\nhard\nto\ndefend\nthe\nimprovement\n(unless\nit\nis\nvery\ndramatic) as a real effect. As noted\nabove, this may explain why some\ninnovations seem to take so long to\ndiffuse through the transit industry;\nthere are very few informal tests which\nhave\nthe\ncredibility\nof\ndesigned\nexperiments unless the effect is very\nlarge and easily observable.\nApplication to Transit Maintenance\nThe potential areas of application\nare almost endless: alternative fuel\ntesting, maintenance of wheelchair lifts,\nbrake retarders, different types of\nlubricants, analysis of air compressors.\nMaintenance aspects of each of these\nand many other innovations have been\nwidely discussed but little tested.\nBut there are clearly a number of\nissues that need to be addressed.\nDesign of experiments in the real world\nis a complicated task, one that requires\nassistance\nfrom\nsomeone\nwith\nstatistical or quality control training.\nLarge\nagencies\nwould\nfind\nexperimental\ndesign\nmost\nuseful\nbecause their size allows them to\nconduct a test on an adequate number\nof vehicles and they have the resources\nto get help with experimental design.\nIt might also be possible to\nconduct\na\ncooperative\nexperiment\namong a group of small agencies. It\nwould require centralized coordination\nand planning to design and monitor the\nexperiment. This is routinely done in\nmedicine with multi-center clinical\ntrials, in which trials of a proposed new\n\ntherapy are carried out at several\ndifferent sites under the guidance of\none clinic. There is great interest lately\nin the statistics field in meta-analysis\nwhich uses statistical techniques to\nsynthesize results quantitatively from a\nnumber of different experiments. Meta-\nanalysis is seen as a cost-effective way\nto\nuse\ndata\nfrom\nmany\nsmall\nexperiments in lieu of mounting a\nsingle, expensive, centrally controlled\nexperiment.\nThe\nuse\nof\nsuch\na\ntechnique in transit could produce\nsmall-scale experiments from many\ndifferent properties, yielding credible\nresults that are applicable to the\nindustry as a whole.\nConclusions and Suggested Research\nMaintenance\norganizations\nin\ntransit agencies are engaged in a variety\nof innovations in their maintenance\npolicies and practices, for reasons\nranging from economic pressures to\nimprovement for its own sake. The use\nof designed experiments for such tests\nis virtually nonexistent in agencies.\nThis is unfortunate, because designed\nexperiments would allow agencies to\nget more precise results from their\ntests. Further, random selection of test\nvehicles would ensure that results could\nbe generalized across the entire fleet.\nThe investment in experiment design\nwould more than pay for itself through\nthe savings gained from innovations\nthat demonstrate benefits and save\nmoney.\nUse\nof\ndesigned\nexperiments\nmight also reverse the tendency for\ninnovations to diffuse slowly through\nthe industry. At the very least the\nexpense of running duplicative and\ninconclusive tests of every proposed\ninnovation at many different agencies\nmight be avoided.\nIn order to prove the value of\ndesigned experiments, the industry\n(perhaps working through APTA and\nFTA) needs to sponsor carefully\ndesigned experiments at operating\nagencies. Such experiments would\nrequire aid particularly in the planning\nphase. These experiments could be\ndone either individually or as multi-\nagency experiments. The latter is\nparticularly attractive because it would\nallow the inclusion of small transit\nagencies, which\ndo not have enough vehicles to have an\nadequate sample for a controlled\nexperiment. However, many small\nagencies could participate in a multi-\nsite experiment and pool their results.\nThe design and administration of such\ntrials would require coordination by\nentities like APTA or FTA.\nSUMMARY: LEVERAGING\nINFORMATION FOR BETTER\nTRANSIT MAINTENANCE\nThis report has focused on three\naspects of information in transit bus\nmaintenance:\nthe\nproduction\nof\ninformation\n(from\ndesigned\nexperiments\nand\ncollection\nof\nmaintenance process data), the use of\ninformation\n(by\nanalysis\nof\nmaintenance process data), and the\nsharing of information between transit\nagencies\n(with\nelectronic\ncommunication). At the present time,\nthe third aspect is the most important;\ntransit maintenance officials have many\nideas to share, both in maintenance\npractice and in the use of maintenance\ninformation, but their opportunities to\ndo so are limited by geographic\ndispersion\nand\nconstrained\ntravel\nbudgets. Given previous failed attempts\nto build electronic communication in\ntransit, the best strategy involves APTA\ncommittees\npioneering\nelectronic\ncommunication and makes use of\nAPTA's role as the voice of the transit\nindustry.\nElectronic\ncommunication\ncan\nalso form the foundation of efforts to\nuse maintenance information better.\nThere are already many innovative uses\nof such information, from collection to\nmethods of analysis and display. What\nis missing is the sharing of questions\nand ideas, something that electronic\ncommunication can remedy. Electronic\naccess\nto\npeople\nwith\nanalytical\nresponsibilities in different-sized transit\norganizations would be an ideal way to\npool resources and diagnose problems.\nThe increasing sophistication of\ncomputer-based\nmaintenance\ninformation systems gives maintenance\nmanagers\naccess\nto\neven\nmore\nknowledge. The ability to archive data\neven on small computers (hard disk\nmemories of a\ngigabyte\nand\ngreater\nare\ncommonplace), the greater ease in\nusing data management tools such as\nspreadsheet programs, and the growing\nflexibility of report writers will give\nmaintenance managers more freedom\nto understand and achieve higher levels\nof performance. Maintenance managers\nin agencies large and small should be\nencouraged to develop data systems\nand report styles that fit their own\nneeds, and to keep abreast of methods\nbeing developed by their counterparts.\nThe proposal to use designed\nexperiments in evaluating maintenance\ninnovations stands apart from the first\ntwo\nrecommendations.\nWhile\nthe\ntechniques\nhave\nbeen\nused\nvery\neffectively in areas of manufacturing,\nthey have not made much headway in\nmaintenance, whether public or private,\nalthough some of the commercial firms\nvisited\n(particularly\nFedEx)\nwere\nbeginning\nto\nrun\nsome\nsimple\nexperiments. As in the electronic\ncommunication area, there is an\nimportant role for a coordinating\nagency such as APTA or FTA to play\nin encouraging the use of designed\nexperiments and ensuring that adequate\ntechnical advice is procured. And there\nis an interaction potential between\nelectronic communication and designed\nexperiments; the information produced\nfrom\nexperiments\ncan\nbe\nshared\neffectively\nvia\nelectronic\ncommunications.\nAnother common characteristic\nlinking the three proposed strategies for\nexploiting information is the cultural\nchange they call for. Maintenance\nmanagers, while retaining the skills\nthey have brought to their present\nposition, must also become symbolic\nanalysts. They need to understand the\nimportance of information and its\nmanipulation in the execution of their\njobs. In responding to demands for\nmore\nflexible\nand\nefficient\nmanagement, they must strive to be\nmore\nanalyst,\nexperimenter,\nand\ncommunicator than they have been\nbefore. This is especially evident in the\ndemand\nfor\nbroader\nand\ndeeper\ncommunication,\nalong\nthe\nlines\npromised by electronic networking. If\nthis form of communication\n\nbecomes all-pervasive, it behooves\nmaintenance managers to be proactive\nin adapting it to their needs rather than\ngrudgingly accepting a tool designed\nby others for different reasons and\npurposes. This cultural change requires\nmuch\ncloser\ninteraction\nbetween\nmaintenance management and top\nmanagement, and between maintenance\nmanagement and the workforce. The\nmaintenance manager must impress\nupon the directors of the agency that\nincreased connectivity, even down to\nthe shop floor, is a vital necessity and\nno boon\ndoggle. Similarly, these agency leaders\nmust give the maintenance manager the\nroom and resources to incur short-term\ncosts (through designed experiments)\nthat promise substantial longer-term\ngains, or to use the analytical capacity\nof increasingly capable MMIS to\ninvestigate\nreasons\nfor\npoor\nperformance, and accept the findings\nwith equaminity.\nThe \"information age\" is recasting\nthe shape of work. Many fields,\nmaintenance included, are discovering\nthat they are \"information intensive,\"\nand\ncan\nuse\ninformation\nmore\nefficiently\nthan\nthey\ndo\nto\nincrease\ntheir\nproductivity. This report has focused on\ninformation\nfor\nmaintenance\nmanagement, but technical information\nsuch as manuals and repair updates are\nalso important and are affected by\nelectronic communication as well.\nWhile information is not a substitute\nfor mechanical experience and hard\nwork, it can play an important\nsupporting\nrole\nin\nensuring\nthat\nexperience and work are effectively\nand efficiently applied in maintenance.\n\nAPPENDIX A\nIDENTIFICATION OF\nEFFECTIVE PRACTICES FROM\nSITE VISITS\nA major part of Phase I research\nwas a series of site visits to public and\nprivate agencies and firms identified as\n\"best performers\" to determine if there\nwere lessons in effective performance\napplicable to the transit industry as a\nwhole. This appendix summarizes the\nlessons learned from those visits.\nPublic agencies were selected on\nthe basis of expert recommendation (in\npart from the research panel input) and\nfrom a statistical analysis of Section 15\nperformance data, comparing agencies,\nwithin peer groups, on the basis of cost-\nper-unit output, spares ratio, labor\ninput, roadcall mileage (weighted less\nto compensate in part for lack of\nstandard definitions of roadcalls) and\ndensity of ridership.\nThe following public and private\norganizations were visited:\nPublic Transit Agencies\n-\nSanta Monica Municipal Bus\nLines, Santa Monica, CA\n-\nLong Beach Transit, Long\nBeach, CA\n-\nSan\nDiego\nTransit,\nSan\nDiego, CA\n-\nMetropolitan\nTransit\nCommission, Minneapolis, MN\n-\nGreater Richmond Transit\nCorporation, Richmond, VA\n-\nVIA Metropolitan Transit,\nSan Antonio, TX\n-\nSan\nFrancisco\nMunicipal\nRailway (MUNI), San Francisco, CA\n-\nBay\nArea\nRapid\nTransit\nDistrict (BART), Technical Support\nServices, Oakland, CA\nCommercial Transport Firms\n-\nLaidlaw Transit, Long Beach,\nCA\n-\nArkansas Best Freight (ABF),\nPico Rivera, CA\n-\nUnited Parcel Service (UPS),\nCerritos Hub, Cerritos, CA\n-\nAmerican President Lines,\nFreight Terminal, San Pedro, CA\n-\nFederal Express Indianapolis\nHub, Indianapolis, IN\n-\nFederal Express Corporate\nHeadquarters, Memphis, TN\n-\nGillig Corporation, Hayward,\nCA\nSynthesis of Site Visit Lessons\nIn analyzing the site visits, two\npoints of divergence were noted. The\nfirst\nis\ncommercial\n(for-profit)\norganizations versus public agencies.\nThe\nperformance\nof\ncommercial\norganizations is often held up as a\nmodel for public agencies, and it is\nimportant to keep in mind the different\nenvironments in which these two\ngroups operate. This is not to say that\nmaintenance\npractices\nfrom\ncommercial\norganizations\nare\ninapplicable to public agencies, nor\neven that the perspective of commercial\norganizations (e.g., toward capital\ninvestments) could not be applied in the\npublic sector, but that such transfer\nneeds to be tempered with knowledge\nof the special circumstances of public\nagencies.\nThe second divergence is at levels\nof performance. Site visits in this phase\nof the project were targeted to agencies\nthat scored well in data analysis.\nHowever, even in this group there were\nclear differences in performance, which\nseemed\nclosely\nrelated\nto\ntheir\nmaintenance practices.\nThere is a range of performance\nlevels\nand\nmaintenance\npractices.\nThese observations, detailed below,\nformed the basis for the research\nquestions which were formulated for\nfurther study.\nCapital Issues\nSpares ratios\nThe first point is the difference in\nattitude toward spare vehicles. Public\ntransit agencies which receive capital\nassistance from FTA are required to\nhold their spares ratios to no more than\n20 percent.9 However, commercial\nagencies and more efficient public\nagencies maintain ratios well below\nthis\nfigure.\nFor\nthe\ncommercial\nagencies, the\nprimary\nmotivation\nis\nclear-cut\nnumbers indicating the cost of such\ncapital investment. Public agencies (for\nwhich the FTA pays 80 percent of the\ncost of new vehicles) do not have this\nvisibility of cost. However, the more\nefficient public agencies have cut their\nratios because of other expenses (e.g.,\nparking space rental) associated with a\nlarge spare fleet. The result is that\ncommercial\nfirms\nand\nthe\nmore\nefficient public agencies operate with\nspares ratios of 8 to 14 percent,\nsuggesting that the current uniform 20\npercent rate for public transit agencies\nneeds further research.\nInventory Management\nA second area of difference is in\ninventory\nmanagement.\nThis\narea\nrequires great care when comparing\ncommercial organizations and public\ntransit agencies because (1)\nthe\ncommercial organizations visited are\ndoing simpler repairs (e.g., little or no\ncomponent rebuilds) and virtually all of\nthe parts they need are in wide\ncommercial use. (The engines and\ntransmissions in transit buses are quite\nsimilar to those used on trucks, but\ntransit buses also have unique air\nconditioners, electronic signs, etc.) In\ngeneral,\ncomparing\nthe\nefficient\nmaintenance organizations (most of the\ncommercial ones and the better public\nones) with the others suggested that the\nbetter organizations turn their inventory\nsubstantially more often (4 or more\nturns compared to 1 to 2 for transit\nsystems), and keep meticulous track of\nwhat was used to avoid repairs being\nhalted for lack of parts. Interestingly,\nthe methods used by the better\norganizations\nvary\nwidely\nby\ncomplexity of the inventory, ranging\nfrom computerized parts lists linked to\na national warehouse to a simple\nscheme by which mechanics who find a\nlow stock condition drop a card on the\nstockman's desk. In contrast, the lower-\nperforming organizations have little\nvisibility\nof\ntheir\ninventory\nperformance (significantly for many of\nthe public agencies, inventory was not\nmanaged by maintenance).\n\nComputerization\nof\ninventory\nmanagement is fairly rare, and it is not\nclear whether this is due to lack of\nacceptable software or because it has\nnot\nbeen\nessential\nfor\nadequate\noperation.\nHowever,\nmost\nfirms\nactively wish to computerize inventory\nmanagement.\nCommercial\nfirms\nare\nalso\naggressively pursuing other methods of\nparts stockage, ranging from quick\ndelivery\nfrom\nlocal\ndealers\nto\nguaranteed overnight delivery from an\nin-house or vendor warehouse. Few of\nthe\npublic\nfirms\nvisited\nwere\nconsidering this seriously. One reason\nis that most of them have significant in\nhouse rebuild capacity, but another\nseemed to be that the U.S. bus\nmanufacturing industry is considered\ntoo fragile to support the costs of\nregularly supplying repair parts on a\nfast-shipment basis. In addition, buying\nrepair parts as part of a bus purchase is\noften subsidized by the FTA, reducing\nthe incentive to look for new methods\nof parts supply.\nLabor Issues\nSpecialists Versus Generalists/In-house\nVersus Contract-out\nTwo related issues were the\nspecialization level of mechanics and\nthe use of contracting out for certain\ntasks such as component rebuild.\nCommercial organizations tend to limit\ntheir scope of repair and value\nmechanics who can do any task done in\nthe shop. Managers claim that this\ngives them flexibility in organizing and\nscheduling work, and allows them to\nget away from rebuild operations which\nare inefficient because of their small\nscale. In contrast, many public agencies\nfoster specialization of mechanics and\ndo most of their rebuild in-house, even\ncomponents having wide commercial\napplication\nsuch\nas\nengines\nand\ntransmissions.\nThe question is complicated by\nissues\nof\nscale\nand\ncommercial\navailability of parts. Very large transit\nagencies may be able to support\nspecialist repair personnel and an\nextensive rebuild capacity, particularly\nfor bus-specific components. However,\ngiven\ncommercial\nexperience,\nthe\nquestion of what agency\ncharacteristics make such an approach\nworthwhile needs research.\nInformation Issues\nDesigned Experiments for Evaluating\nMaintenance Practices\nWhile\nthe\nuse\nof\ndesigned\nexperiments for evaluating process\nchanges has wide acceptance in many\nindustries, most of the sites visited\nprofessed not to use them. Instead,\nmost relied on informal tests tried on a\nsmall scale and assessed the results\nqualitatively.\nHowever,\none\ntransportation company with a widely\ndispersed fleet of light vehicles did\nclaim\nto\nuse\nexperimentation\nto\nevaluate a variety of new maintenance-\nrelated\nissues,\nincluding\nnew\ncomponents,\nmaintenance\nproducts,\nand maintenance practices. In this\ncompany,\nexperiments\ncould\nbe\ninitiated at the local or corporate level,\nbut had to be approved by the corporate\nfleet maintenance manager's office to\nensure adequate design and to avoid\nduplication of effort.\nInformation Sharing\nOne of the questions asked at each\nsite\nvisit\nwas\nhow\nmuch\ncommunication\neach\nmaintenance\norganization\nhad\nwith\nother\nmaintenance shops in similar agencies.\nIn the public transit agencies, the\nmanagers uniformly said that they had\npersonal networks with other managers,\nbut that these were used primarily when\nbus purchases were being considered,\nsupplemented\nby\ninformal\nconversations\nat\nannual\nmeetings.\nSurprisingly, managers of commercial\norganizations reported discussions with\npeers of maintenance problems and the\nexchange of maintenance tips in a\nmuch wider variety of situations (social\ncontacts, local maintenance lunches,\nand\nparticipation\nin\nnational\norganizations such as the American\nTrucking\nAssociation's\nTruck\nMaintenance Council). This is true\neven of managers of companies in\ndirect competition with each other;\neven under these conditions, much\nvaluable information was shared.\nProcess\nInformation\nand\nWork\nPlanning\nThe computerization of inventory\ninformation is not the only automation\ninitiative being considered by repair\norganizations: many of the efficient\norganizations are considering acquiring\ncomputer systems to track other aspects\nof the repair process, including parts\nusage and labor required for specific\nrepair\njobs,\ncomponent\nlifetime\nmonitoring (at least for complex\ncomponents\nlike\nengines,\ntransmissions,\nand\nair-conditioning\nunits), and complete repair histories.\nMany of the efficient agencies keep\nsubstantial paper records, and use them\nto set work standards, but they have\nfound that detailed analysis requires a\ngreat deal of sifting through paper files.\nGiven that current technology\nallows the accumulation of extensive\ndata on a vehicle fleet, it is necessary to\ndecide what data are useful and feasible\nto record. How can such information be\nused in planning and executing vehicle\nfleet maintenance? Current practice\nvaries widely, and some of the more\ncomputerized organizations are not the\nmost efficient.\nUpper Management Involvement\nAnother issue for maintenance\nmanagement is the degree to which\nmaintenance is a concern of upper\nmanagement,\nthat\nis,\nwhether\nmaintenance is considered a core\ncapability of a transport organization.\nCommercial\nfirms\nand\nthe\nmost\nefficient public agencies have a flat\nmanagement structure, with the director\nof maintenance reporting directly to the\ngeneral manager. Other public agencies\nhave one or two levels of management\nbetween the maintenance manager and\nthe top executive.\nOne of the case study questions\nfor\ngeneral\nmanagers\nwas\nwhat\ninformation did they look for from\nmaintenance\nto\nassess\nits\njob\nperformance. The managers of flat\norganizations usually had a variety of\nformal and informal contacts with\nmaintenance management; the others\nreceived a formal report at various\nintervals,\nwhich\nlisted\na\nfew\nperformance\nindicators\nsuch\nas\nroadcalls.\n\nAPPENDIX B\nPHASE II CASE STUDIES\nSelection of Case Studies\nFor the study on maintenance data\nand\ninformation,\nresources\nwere\nbudgeted to carry out five case\nstudies/site visits. In line with the\noverall goal of the project to find\ninnovative\nmaintenance\npractices,\nselection was focused on finding\nagencies which were good at using\nmaintenance\ninformation\nin\nthe\nmanagement\nof\ntheir\nmaintenance\nprocesses. In particular, the complexity\nof an agency's computer system or the\nmere collection of voluminous data was\nnot of primary interest. Although it\nwould have also been interesting to\nvisit agencies which had problems in\nthe area of maintenance information,\nthe success stories were more valuable\nin providing good ideas.\nBecause\nan\nintangible\ncharacteristic is of interest, namely\nwhether an agency was good at using\nmaintenance information, looking only\nat quantitative aspects of an agency's\ninformation systems would not be\nuseful. Instead, the search began with a\nseries of phone interviews with the\nmembers\nof\nthe\nMaintenance\nManagement subcommittee of APTA's\nBus\nEquipment\nand\nMaintenance\ncommittee. Seventeen members were\ncontacted and asked to nominate\nproperties that were equally good in\ncollecting maintenance data and in\nusing the data to manage their\nmaintenance function. They were also\nasked to recommend commercial fleet\noperators who made good use of\nmaintenance\ninformation.\nTo\nsupplement the nominations from the\nMaintenance\nManagement\nsubcommittee, other contacts in the\nindustry, used in Phase I, were also\ninterviewed.\nAlmost all interviewees gave from\ntwo to five agencies that they thought\nwere outstanding in using maintenance\ninformation. There were some overlaps,\nbut the final list contained 30 agencies.\nBasic information on each agency\n(primarily size and passenger load) was\nobtained from the Section 15 database.\nThis information was used to select 12\nagencies ranging in size and location\nand carrying fairly heavy passenger\nloads in their size category.\nThe maintenance manager of each\ncandidate agency was called and\nanswered a short questionnaire that\ncovered\nmost\nof\nthe\ndetails\nof\nmaintenance data collection and use.\nPermission\nfor\na\nsite\nvisit\nwas\nrequested.\nThe final selection was based on\nthe recommendations, the Section 15\ndata, and the telephone interviews. The\nselections were Reno Citifare (small,\nwestern); Orlando LYNX (medium,\nsouthern); San Antonio VIA (medium,\nsouthwestern); Toronto TTC (large,\nnortheastern); and Ryder Truck Leasing\n(commercial fleet operator). A brief\nprofile of each agency selected follows\nbelow, including basic statistics and\ntheir collection and use of maintenance\ninformation.\nCASE STUDY ORGANIZATION\nPROFILES\nReno\nBasic statistics. RTC/Citifare is\nthe Reno bus agency. It operates 63\nbuses in the Reno-Sparks, NV, area\n(covering about 58 sq mi) and has 20\nmechanics at its single operating\ngarage, which is in operation around\nthe clock. The Regional Transportation\nCommission (RTC) is responsible for\nmass transit as well as street and\nhighway planning and construction,\nparatransit\n(RTC/Citilift),\nand\ncountywide transportation planning.\nMaintenance\ninformation\nsystem.\nCitifare\ncurrently\nuses\nFleetMate, written by Multisystems of\nBoston, MA. It has been computerized,\nusing FleetMate, since 1987, which\ngives it a fairly lengthy set of\ncomputerized maintenance records. The\nsystem\nis\nadministered\nby\nthe\npurchasing agent in charge of parts\nprocurement.\nData collection and use. There\nare two primary instruments for data\ncollection, both paper. The mechanic\nfills out a numbered repair order for\neach job performed, including the date,\nemployee number, time used, and a\ncode\nfor the system/subsystem repaired (4-6\ncharacters). As parts are needed, the\nmechanic turns in a material requisition\nat the parts desk, including the\ndescription and repair order number,\nand the part is provided by the parts\nclerk.\nEvery\nday\nthe\nsystem\nadministrator enters both the repair\norder\ninformation\nand\nthe\nparts\ninformation to update the inventory and\nkeep track of hours. Repair orders are\nclosed daily so that inventory is\nproperly recorded as issued; jobs which\ntake multiple days are recorded on\nmultiple repair orders.\nFuel usage and mileage are\nrecorded nightly for each bus and\nentered\nthe\nfollowing\nmorning.\nRoadcalls are kept in a manual file by\nthe shop foreman.\nThe automated system is used to\ngenerate five reports monthly: the\nvehicle\nperformance\nreport,\nthe\nservicing report, the vehicle cost report,\na labor report by mechanic, and an\ninventory on hand report. This is\ncombined with information from the\nshop foreman on roadcalls and tire\nusage to produce a monthly statistical\nreport\nwhich\nsummarizes\nkey\nperformance indicators (road calls,\nparts cost/mile, overtime, etc.) and\ngeneral statistics (revenue miles, tire\nmileage, etc.). Many entries include\nspaces for the same statistics for the\nprior month. This report is the\nfundamental tool for the maintenance\nmanager to look at the maintenance\noperation and to report to general\nmanagement.\nWhile\nmost\nof\nthe\ninformation is available from the\nautomated system, the final entry onto\nthe statistical report is done by hand\nand\nwith\nsome\ncalculator\nwork.\nAuxiliary reports are available for\nsupporting detail and getting more\ninformation on suspect values.\nAlthough the computer system can\ntrack serial-numbered components by\nbus, the small size of the Citifare fleet\nallows them to do this effectively with\npaper records. Citifare has not used job\ntime information to establish formal\nstandard times.\nInnovations. Because of its small\nsize,\nthe\nCitifare\nmaintenance\nautomation structure is very lean. As\nnoted above, the purchasing agent for\n\nparts does much of the data entry\n(which includes responsibility for data\nquality) and report running, while the\nshop supervisors ensure that the data is\nrecorded by mechanics and hustlers.\nThe foremen and purchasing agent are\nthe analytic staff, together with the\nmaintenance manager. In addition to\nusing FleetMate, Citifare also makes\nsome use of other graphical programs\nto do graphical displays for their data,\nalthough this is not in regular use in\ntheir monthly statistical report.\nThe coding scheme used to\nidentify systems and subsystems has\nbeen refined by the shop foremen to\nreflect the work at Citifare and to\nminimize the data collection burden on\nthe mechanic. One shop foreman\nestimated that each mechanic spent\nabout 15 minutes at the end of a shift\nfilling out workorders with time and\nsystem/subsystem information.\nCitifare has the capability to do\nelectronic mail on their computer\nsystem, but at the time of the visit it\nwas not used. However, interest in\nelectronic communication is growing\nsince some parts of the RTC (e.g.,\nplanning) are not co-located with\nCitifare.\nFuture plans. Citifare is looking\nforward to Multisystems' promised\nimprovements\nto\nFleetMate,\nparticularly in support modules such as\npurchasing. There are features they\nwould like to see in reporting formats,\nand they are considering the use of a\nreport writer on the FleetMate database\nfor customized reports. However, the\nleanness of the staff severely limits the\ntime available to experiment with new\nreports and analyses, and RTC financial\nconstraints\nrestrict\nattendance\nat\nmeetings.\nOrlando LYNX\nBasic statistics. LYNX operates\napproximately 200 buses in Orlando,\nFL, (a 370-sq-mi area) out of two\nmaintenance facilities, one at its\nheadquarters and a smaller facility for\nPMs\nonly.\nLYNX\nemploys\nmechanics\nand\nfueler/cleaners.\nRidership is growing rapidly, and\nLYNX is expanding (current plans call\nfor 300 to 500 buses by 2000) because\nOrlando's\npre-1990\nmass\ntransit\nhas\nbeen\ninadequate.\nMaintenance\ninformation\nsystem.\nLYNX\nhas\nbeen\nusing\nFleetMate since 1986. The system is\nadministered by the MIS department,\nalong with other agency information\nsystems.\nData collection and use. The\nprimary data collection instrument for\nLYNX is a single numbered paper\nworkorder form, which is organized\ninto a set of jobs (numbered in\nsequence), each of which has an\nactivity code and a system/subsystem\ncode. The codes were redone a year ago\nto reflect current practice and usage.\nThe mechanic fills this part of the form\nout, along with a record of labor time.\nA separate part of the form lists parts\nused\nby\njob\nnumber;\nthe\nparts\ninformation is filled out by the parts\nclerk. The secretary to the maintenance\nmanager is responsible for entering this\ndata, as well as the mileage/fluids\ninformation collected overnight by the\nhustlers. Jobs are closed daily to record\nall parts as issued; multi-day jobs are\nrecorded as a series of work orders.\nManagement routinely looks at\ntabular reports on labor performance by\nmechanic, a daily printout of closed\nworkorders that includes work done\nand parts and labor costs, and a vehicle\nperformance\nreport\nsummarizing\ncurrent mileage, fluids usage, and\ncost/mile. A series of graphics covering\nlonger periods summarizes roadcalls,\ninspections made, and miles driven.\nThese reports are routinely used for\nmonitoring maintenance performance,\nand are frequently supplemented by\nspecial analyses of specific areas of\nconcern.\nThe work history is available to\nmechanics on terminals near the shop\nfloor. A few mechanics have mastered\nthe use of the system, and most of the\nothers regularly turn to them for\ninformation,\nparticularly\nwhen\ndetermining the details of a previous\nrepair job (e.g., components replaced)\non the vehicle they are working on.\nInventory\nis\nalso\nmanaged\nexclusively by FleetMate, but there are\ngaps in its capabilities that the\norganization wants to fill. This includes\nthe ability to have a real-time picture of\nthe inventory;\ncurrently, the inventory is only updated\nin the morning when work orders are\nclosed. Management is trying to assess\nthe tradeoff between having inventory\nand maintenance integrated and using a\nsupplementary system in inventory\nmanagement\nto\nprovide\nextra\ninformation.\nInnovations. LYNX makes heavy\nuse of its data, in tabular form,\nalthough graphics are common in its\npresentations. As a rapidly growing\nfleet with little opportunity to retire old\nbuses, it sees maintenance as a key\nfactor in keeping its vehicles running.\nUnlike many other properties,\nLYNX\ntracks\nseveral\ndifferent\ncomponents by serial number, even\nwhen moved between vehicles, in order\nto remove the component before\nfailure, reasoning that a rebuild or buy\nis\ncheaper\nthan\nfixing\na\nfailed\ncomponent such as an engine or\ntransmission.\nLYNX also emphasizes analysis\nof its data, particularly in maintenance,\nby naming one person to handle special\nanalyses. They are embarking on a new\nprogram of intensive PMs for the fleet,\nand are using their maintenance data to\nestimate costs and benefits.\nFuture\nplans.\nThe\nMIS\ndepartment\nis\nhiring\na\npart-time\nprogrammer to work with the new\nreport writer, which will access the\nFleetMate database to produce custom\nreports. They plan to use this capability\nboth on current data and on their\narchived data to look at long-term\ntrends.\nSan Antonio VIA\nBasic statistics. VIA serves the\nmetropolitan San Antonio area (1200\nsq mi). It has 529 transit buses and 156\nparatransit vehicles (VIAtrans), all of\nwhich are maintained out of a single\ngarage. The maintenance workforce\n(mechanics and support staff) number\napproximately 250. The transit fleet is\nRTS buses.\nMaintenance\ninformation\nsystem. Until the early 1990s, the\nmaintenance function at VIA relied on\npaper\nrecords\nfor\nmaintenance\nmanagement, including maintenance\nhistories of vehicles and timekeeping.\nThis resulted in problems\n\nwith anticipated response delays from\nsharing\nmainframe\nresources\nwith\nadministrative departments.) By 1994\nsome data were automated, and VIA\nwas preparing to bring in a new\ncomprehensive\nsystem\nwhich\ntied\ntogether work histories, time keeping,\nand parts requisitions and would use\nnew data entry technology such as\nmagnetic card swipes and bar codes.\nThe system was specified in-house and\nwritten by a consultant to run on a\ncentral computer. The MIS department\nmanages this system.\nThe system is now up and\nrunning, but some major procedural\nchanges\nare\nbeing\nconsidered\nto\nincrease repair information, particularly\ndetails on task performance and the use\nof codes to designate repair activities.\nThe receiving area is also in the process\nof being computerized.\nData collection and use. Work on\na bus is initiated by a job order ticket\non which is written the problem\nobserved, based on either an operator's\nreport or a mechanic's observation. The\nticket receives a bar-coded sticker, and\nis assigned to a mechanic for work. The\nmechanic opens work on the job by\nreading the bar code on the ticket and\nswiping his personal magnetic card at a\nwork station, then pushing a button to\nindicate that he is starting the job.\nSimilar actions are done to indicate\nwhen he is leaving a job or has finished\nit. To order parts, the mechanic fills out\na barcoded parts request, using the\nnumber of the vehicle under repair. The\nparts clerk ties the part number to the\nrequisition by bar-code scanning the\nrequisition and the parts bin, but the tie\nto the vehicle is done later at manual\ndata entry. Note that the parts are\nformally tied to the vehicle, not the job\nnumber.\nWork done is written on the job\ncard and manually entered into the job\nrecord\nby\ndata\nentry\npersonnel.\nSearches of a vehicle's repair history\ncan then be limited by looking for\nkeywords in the written text. The\nmodifications\nunder\nconsideration\nwould use a six-position job code to\nidentify repair actions, which would be\nscanned by the mechanic as a bar code\nat the completion of a task.\nThe\nmechanics\nuse\nrepair\nhistories about 2 to 3 times per shift,\nbut access\ncurrently requires clerks to call them\nup. For roadcall jobs, the recent\nhistories are printed out automatically\nand given to the mechanics before they\nhead to the vehicles.\nThe\noriginal\ndesign\nof\nthe\nmaintenance system was to facilitate\naccess to information already in use by\nmaintenance management. One of the\nmajor pieces of information used by\nmanagement is parts usage in repair\njobs. Prior to this, it was done manually\nusing paper records (with a 3-day\ndelay) but is now done with computer\nand only has a 24-hour delay (for the\nfinal data entry). Other reports include\na history report for closed jobs and a\nnumber of employee-based reports\nshowing such things as attendance and\nbreakdown of work activity.\nInnovations. Because the current\nsystem is new and some functions are\nstill being added, VIA is still exploring\nother methods of using the available\ndata. Switching from paper data to the\ncomputer has greatly improved the\nefficiency of their standard procedures.\nFuture plans. Plans to use repair\ncodes and to break down tasks into\nsubparts (diagnosis, repair, check) are\nunder way, and are being implemented\nshop by shop to test how well the\nsystem\nworks.\nThe\nincreasing\ncapability to do ad hoc reports (without\nburdening\nthe\nMIS\ndepartment)\nsubstantially improves the use and\nquality\nof\ndata\nthroughout\nthe\nmaintenance system.\nToronto Transit Commission (TTC)\nBasic statistics. The TTC is a\nlarge multimodal transit agency serving\nthe metropolitan Toronto area (244 sq\nmi). It operates nearly 1,600 buses\n(including a 25-bus natural-gas fleet),\napproximately 250 light rail vehicles,\nand a heavy rail subway with 622\nvehicles. The buses are maintained out\nof eight operating garages, backed up\nby one heavy maintenance and rebuild\ngarage.\nMaintenance\nemploys\napproximately 800 people. The average\nage of TTC's bus fleet is relatively old\n(10.4 years) due to their following\ngovernment standards for bus age and\nto a hiatus in acquisition, which has\nnow been relaxed.\nMaintenance\ninformation\nsystem.\nThe\nTTC's\nVehicle\nMaintenance System (VMS) is used for\nits bus and streetcar fleet. (The subway\nhas its own system, which reflects both\nthe difference in complexity between\nthe vehicles and the organization of\nmaintenance work.) It is a radically\nmodified\nversion\nof\nthe\nsystem\ndeveloped and used by Metro-Dade.\nDevelopment of the system began in\n1989 in response to a perceived need\nfor a maintenance management system\nfor supervisors and mechanics, as\nopposed to a reporting system for upper\nmanagement. VMS was specified and\nits development overseen by a core\ngroup of maintenance supervisors from\nTTC, backed up by technical people\nfrom the management services group\n(data processing). This team was the\ninterim administration of VMS, and\nwas responsible for its development,\nfielding, and initial support. Fielding is\nnow complete; as of this writing the\nfuture management structure of VMS\nhas not yet been decided.\nData collection and use. Data\nentry is done by the mechanics\nthemselves and is checked by foremen.\nThe primary interest is in capturing the\nproblem, system/subsystem code, and\nwhat was done, since these form the\nbasis\nof\nthe\nmost-used\nreports.\nInformation regarding parts used in a\nrepair is not much used by maintenance\nmanagement; overall parts usage is\ncaptured\nby\na\nseparate\nmaterial\ninformation system, which is used for\nordering and issuing parts. In the\nopinion of the VMS managers, the\ncomputer entry is less time-consuming\nfor the mechanics than the older system\nof filling out paper job cards, and data\nquality has steadily improved as the\nmechanics have switched to using\nVMS information during repair. The\nonly drawback is that data can be lost\nduring very heavy workload periods,\nsuch as during extremely cold weather.\nFuel information is kept locally by\noperating garage, but is not tied to\nindividual buses or not captured by\nVMS.\nVMS\nis\nalso\nused\nfor\ntimekeeping purposes, feeding hours\nreported directly into payroll. Several\ncomponents are serial-number tracked\n\non\nbuses\n(engines,\ntransmissions,\ncompressors, and sometimes starters)\nbut little use has been made of the data.\nOne feature of VMS is that, due\nthe open nature of the information,\nmost performance measures for each\ngarage can be read by all managers\nacross the system.\nVMS is oriented to the garage\nmaintenance manager, and its aim is to\nprovide 20 to 30 standardized reports\nfor\nwhich\nthe\nmanager\nspecifies\nparameters (such as dates and vehicles\nincluded). These are the most important\nreports for the garage manager:\n1.\nStatus\nSummary\nReport,\nwhich indicates the number of buses\navailable for service, along with the\nrequirements for rush-hour and normal\nservice and any special needs, such as\ncharters. It is updated in real time as\nwork is finished.\n2.\nRoadcall/change\noff\nlist,\nwhich lists all vehicles with a roadcall,\ntheir problem, and status.\n3.\nMTO inspection list, which\nlists the due date of the next 6-month\ninspection for each vehicle.\n4.\nRepeater list, which lists the\nnumber of defects by subsystem for all\nvehicles which have been in the shop\nabove a minimum number of times in a\ngiven time period (like 2 weeks).\n5.\nWork pending list, which\nlists all deferred maintenance by\nvehicle. This is used to plan work so\nthat the out-of-service time will include\nthe deferred maintenance for any\nvehicle brought in for repairs.\n6.\nSummary of closed work\norders (period covered specified by the\nmanager) which allows a review of\nwork recently done, defects noted, and\nlength of time the vehicle was in the\nshop.\nVMS also supports a central group\nof\ntechnical\nassistants,\nlicensed\nmechanics\nwho\nwork\nfor\nthe\nsuperintendent of garages and use VMS\nto view problems and trends across\ngarages. The reports that they use are\naggregate ones, such as the Status\nSummary Report, and ad hoc reports\nbased on special queries of the VMS\ndata.\nInnovations. TTC's innovations\nare in the implementation of a multi-\ngarage\ninformation system in which data flows\nback and forth easily, and in mechanic\nentry of repair information. Everything\nthat gets recorded about a repair is done\nby the person who either did it or\nsupervised it. This means that start-up\nrequires training for all mechanics and\na\nbuy-in\nperiod\nduring\nwhich\nmechanics\ndiscover\nthat\nVMS\nusefulness depends directly on their\ndata entry.\nFuture plans. One aim is to\nenhance data entry by introducing such\nthings as bar-code readers and touch\nscreens. This will allow better data\ncollection\non\nserial-number-tracked\ncomponents and on parts usage per\nrepair order. Another aim is to\nautomatically capture warranty claims\ninformation to make full use of the\ncontracted for support.\nAt the time of the visit, TTC was\nundergoing reorganization, in which\nthe\ngarages\nwere\nseparated\ninto\nindividual\noperating\nunits,\nwith\nmaintenance and operations responsible\nto a single garage manager. The role of\na central maintenance analysis group\nhad not been fully settled.\nRyder Commercial Leasing and\nServices\nBasic\nstatistics.\nRyder\nCommercial Leasing and Services\n(RCLS) is the entity in Ryder Systems\nInc., which specializes in vehicle\nleasing. RCLS has 900 branches, most\nof which have their own repair facilities\nand each of which is a separate profit\ncenter. The total fleet is 145,000\nvehicles, with approximately 25% to\n30% turnover per year. They have a\ntechnician (mechanic) workforce of\napproximately 8,300. Branches have\n400 to 500 vehicles and 20 technicians.\nMaintenance\ninformation\nsystem.\nRCLS\nhas\ndeveloped\na\ncomprehensive\nproprietary\nmaintenance information system called\nFastTrack. In the early 1990s, most of\nthe branch maintenance information\nprocessing was manual and paper-\nbased\n(forms\nwere\nphysically\ntransferred to the division where\nselected data elements were entered\ninto a computer for transfer to\nheadquarters and further analysis).\nRCLS had been experimenting to find a\nway to automate\ndifferent parts of the maintenance\ninformation collection and use. In late\n1991, a decision was made to decrease\nthe amount of time maintenance\nmanagement\nwas\nspending\non\npaperwork in favor of more interaction\nwith\ncustomers\nand\nsupervising\ntechnicians. Accordingly, RCLS started\ndevelopment of FastTrack in 1992.\nFastTrack consists of five parts:\nservice island automation, automated\ndiagnostics,\nvehicle\non-board\ncomputer, shop management system,\nand\ntechnical\ninformation.\nThe\nautomated\ndiagnostics\nand\ncomputerized technical information do\nnot communicate with the other parts;\nthey\nsimply\nprovide\ntools\nand\ninformation for the mechanics as they\nwork. Various parts of FastTrack have\nbeen fielded in different phases, but the\nfielding of the shop management part\nwas being completed in summer 1995.\nData collection and use. Data\ncollection from the service island\nautomation and the vehicle's on-board\ncomputer is completely automated; the\nonly\nhuman\nintervention\nis\nthe\nattachment of a probe to the vehicle\ncomputer outlet on the outside of the\nvehicle. Vehicle identity and fuel usage\nare automatically captured for billing\nand the on-board computer provides\nsome diagnostic information.\nIn the shop management system,\nthe\nmechanics\nprovide\nparts\ninformation and work time, and the full\nnine-digit ATA code for the part of the\nvehicle worked on, as well as text\ncomments. These are entered locally\ninto the shop management system by\ndata entry clerks, not technicians. The\nsystem also maintains configuration\ninformation on each vehicle as repairs\nare made; for a tractor with an\nelectronically controlled engine, 15\nparts are tracked by serial number and\n200 parts are tracked by manufacturer\nand date of installation.\nSince\nthe\nshop\nmanagement\nmodule is fairly new, much of the use\nlocally is the generation of fairly\nstandard reports related to jobs closed\nand labor information. However, one of\nthe features of the shop management\nsystem has had a great impact on the\nmaintenance operation; this feature is a\n\nbreakdown of individual mechanic\nqualifications and experience within a\nbranch (internal Ryder training and\nexternal certification), which it uses\ndaily for automatic job assignment.\nFastTrack also sends much of the\ninformation from shop management\nand the service island to upper levels of\nthe\ncompany\n(district\nthrough\ncorporate). The newness of the system\nmeans that upper management is only\nbeginning to appreciate the benefits\ngained from these data.\nInnovations. Some of the most\ninnovative aspects of FastTrack are\ndiagnostics\nand\ntechnical\ndocumentation and the use of on-board\ncomputers for vehicle status. The shop\nmanagement\nsystem schedules the mechanics into\njobs, based on the mechanics' training,\nthe time needed for the job, and the\njob's deadline. It can further redo a\nschedule if a particular job hits an\nunexpected obstacle. This was done\nspecifically to relieve the branch\nmaintenance\nmanager\nof\nthis\ntimeconsuming task.\nThe configuration information is\ntracked in much greater detail here than\nat any other organization visited. The\ngains are twofold; by keeping careful\ntrack of warranty information, RCLS\ncan collect payments due, and warranty\nclaim generation is entirely automatic,\nfreeing up the mechanic.\nFuture plans. Since fielding of\nvarious parts of FastTrack is either still\nunder way or has just been completed,\nRCLS is still exploring the uses of such\na rich collection of data. While the shop\nmanagement module offers a number\nof cutting-edge capabilities at branch\nlevel, bigger opportunities are probably\nin the use of data at the national level to\ncompare branches and note where good\nideas and problems are occurring, and\nto\nprovide\ninformation\nabout\nnationwide performance of equipment\nfrom different manufacturers and in\ndifferent configurations. This requires a\ncorporate-level\nanalytic\nstaff\nwith\nmaintenance expertise.\n\nENDNOTES\n1.

For example, one commercial provider of e-mail services requires a $35/year fee, but otherwise no minimum monthly\ncharges; it also offers an optional Windows-based e-mail management software package at $99 to increase the ease of\nhandling, filing, and retrieving e-mail messages.\n3. This would be equivalent to the common Internet procedure for issuing \"requests for discussion\" and \"call for votes\"\nfor proposed new bulletin boards.\n4. UPS, in contrast, has had its maintenance management information system in place for years, although with upgrades\nin capability.\n5. The FastTrack system is described in Appendix B.\n6. John E. Dolce, Analytical Fleet Maintenance Management, Warrendale, PA: Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.,\n1994, p. 176.\n7. (Giuliani, 1987). For example, the interval between oil changes for a sample of agencies ranged from 6,000 to 12,000\nmi; miles between lubrications ranged between 3,000 and 12,000 mi; safety inspections occurred anywhere between 900\nand 9,000 mi.\n8. A similar suggestion was made in the Transportation Research Circular 289, Page 8 (see endnote 1).\n9. Waivers are given in certain cases, and some agencies have contingency or reserve fleets, not available for peak\nservice, which do not count in the official spares.

Current systems, some of which are old and in need\nof upgrading, must expand service area, increase service frequency,\nand improve efficiency to serve these demands. Research is\nnecessary to solve operating problems, to adapt appropriate new\ntechnologies from other industries, and to introduce innovations into\nthe transit industry. The Transit Cooperative Research Program\n(TCRP) serves as one of the principal means by which the transit\nindustry can develop innovative near-term solutions to meet demands\nplaced on it.\nThe need for TCRP was originally identified in TRB Special\nReport 213--Research for Public Transit: New Directions, published\nin 1987 and based on a study sponsored by the Federal Transit\nAdministration (FTA). A report by the American Public Transit\nAssociation (APTA), Transportation 2000, also recognized the need\nfor local, problem-solving research. TCRP, modeled after the\nlongstanding and successful National Cooperative Highway Research\nProgram, undertakes research and other technical activities in\nresponse to the needs of transit service providers. The scope of vice\nconfiguration, equipment, facilities, operations, human resources,\nmaintenance, policy, and administrative practices.\nTCRP was established under FTA sponsorship in July 1992.\nProposed by the U.S. Department of Transportation, TCRP was\nauthorized as part of the Intermodal Surface Transportation\nEfficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA). On May 13, 1992, a memorandum\nagreement outlining TCRP operating procedures was executed by the\nthree cooperating organizations: FTA, the National Academy of\nSciences, acting through the Transportation Research Board (TRB),\nand the Transit Development Corporation, Inc. (TDC), a nonprofit\neducational and research organization established by APTA. TDC is\nresponsible for forming the independent governing board, designated\nas the TCRP Oversight and Project Selection (TOPS) Committee.\nResearch\nproblem statements for TCRP are solicited\nperiodically but may be submitted to TRB by anyone at anytime. It is\nthe responsibility of the TOPS Committee to formulate the research\nprogram by identifying the highest priority projects. As part of the\nevaluation, the TOPS Committee defines funding levels and expected\nproducts.\nOnce selected, each project is assigned to an expert panel,\nappointed by the Transportation Research Board. The panels prepare\nproject statements (requests for proposals), select contractors, and\nprovide technical guidance and counsel throughout the life of the\nproject. The process for developing research problem statements and\nselecting research agencies has been used by TRB in managing\ncooperative research programs since 1962. As in other TRB activities,\nTCRP project panels serve voluntarily without compensation.\nBecause research cannot have the desired impact if products\nfail to reach the intended audience, special emphasis is placed on\ndisseminating TCRP results to the intended end-users of the research:\ntransit agencies, service providers, and suppliers. TRB provides a\nseries of research reports, syntheses of transit practice, and other\nsupporting material developed by TCRP research. APTA will arrange\nfor workshops, training aids, field visits, and other activities to\nensure that results are implemented by urban and rural transit\nindustry practitioners.\nThe TCRP provides a forum where transit agencies can\ncooperatively address common operational problems. TCRP results\nsupport and complement other ongoing transit research and training\nprograms.\nTCRP SYNTHESIS 22\nProject J-7, Topic SF-04\nISSN 1073-4880\nISBN 0-309-06014-1\nLibrary of Congress Catalog Card No 97-066621\n(c) 1997 Transportation Research Board\nPrice $16.00\nNOTICE\nThe project that is the subject of this report was a part of the Transit\nCooperative Research Program conducted by the Transportation\nResearch Board with the approval of the Governing Board of the\nNational Research Council.

This information has resulted from research and from the\nsuccessful application of solutions to problems by individuals or organizations.\nThere is a continuing need to provide a systematic means for compiling this\ninformation and making it available to the entire transit community in a usable\nformat. The Transit Cooperative Research Program includes a synthesis series\ndesigned to search for and synthesize useful knowledge from all available sources\nand to prepare documented reports on current practices in subject areas of concern\nto the transit industry.\nThis synthesis series reports on various practices, making specific\nrecommendations where appropriate but without the detailed directions usually\nfound in handbooks or design manuals. Nonetheless, these documents can serve\nsimilar purposes, for each is a compendium of the best knowledge available on\nthose measures found to be successful in resolving specific problems. The extent\nto which these reports are useful will be tempered by the user' s knowledge and\nexperience in the particular problem area.\nThis synthesis will be of interest to transit agency general managers, as well as\nto bus operations and maintenance personnel. It will also be of interest to\nequipment suppliers, consultants, and others concerned with bus maintenance\noperations. This synthesis describes current practices related to maintenance\nperformance. The objective is to identify how maintenance performance measures\ndrive day-to-day and strategic decisions.\nAdministrators, practitioners, and researchers are continually faced with issues\nor problems on which there is much information, either in the form of reports or in\nterms of undocumented experience and practice. Unfortunately, this information\noften is scattered or not readily available in the literature, and, as a consequence, in\nseeking solutions, full information on what has been learned about an issue or\nproblem is not assembled. Costly research findings may go unused, valuable\nexperience may be overlooked, and full consideration may not be given to the\navailable methods of solving or alleviating the issue or problem. In an effort to\ncorrect this situation, the Transit Cooperative Research Program (TCRP) Synthesis\nProject, carried out by the Transportation Research Board as the research agency,\nhas the objective of reporting on common transit issues and problems and\nsynthesizing available information. The synthesis reports from this endeavor\nconstitute a TCRP publication series in which various forms of relevant\ninformation are assembled into single, concise documents pertaining to a specific\nproblem or closely related issues.\nThis report of the Transportation Research Board addresses traditional\nmaintenance performance measures such as Section 15 indicators, as well as others\nused for decision making and those that affect customer service. These include, but\nare not limited to the ratio of scheduled versus unscheduled maintenance, customer\nmarketing and employee opinion surveys, roadcalls, productive versus non\nproductive time, causes for delay, product defects, and induced failures\n\nTo develop this synthesis in a comprehensive manner and to ensure inclusion of significant knowledge, available\ninformation was assembled from numerous sources, including a number of public transportation agencies. A topic panel of\nexperts in the subject area was established to guide the researchers in organizing and evaluating the collected data, and to review\nthe final synthesis report.\nThis synthesis is an immediately useful document that records practices that were acceptable within the limitations of the\nknowledge available at the time of its preparation. As the processes of advancement continue, new knowledge can be expected to\nbe added to that now at hand.\n\nCONTENTS\nSUMMARY\nCHAPTER ONE\nINTRODUCTION\nPurpose and Scope, 3\nApproach, 3\nOrganization, 4\nCHAPTER TWO\nIDENTIFYING KEY ISSUES IN BUS\nMAINTENANCE PERFORMANCE\nSurvey Questionnaire, 5\nKey Issues In Elements of Bus Maintenance Performance, 5\nQuestionnaire Development, 6\nBasic Sources Used for Performance Monitoring, 6\n10 CHAPTER THREE\nSUMMARY OF SURVEY RESPONSES\n14 CHAPTER FOUR\nDISCUSSION OF SURVEY RESPONSES\nManagement Philosophy, 14\nEmployee Productivity, 16\nEquipment Performance, 20\nControlling Costs, 24\n26 CHAPTER FIVE\nCONCLUSIONS\n28 REFERENCES\n28 BIBLIOGRAPHY\n29 ABBREVIATIONS AND ACRONYMS\n30 APPENDIX A\nSURVEY QUESTIONNAIRE\n32 APPENDIX B\nCASE STUDIES\nUNITED PARCEL SERVICE, 32\nVIA METROPOLITAN TRANSIT,\nCENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION\nMILWAUKEE COUNTY TRANSIT SYSTEM, 38\nAUTHORITY, 41\nPHOENIX TRANSIT SYSTEM, 44\nANN ARBOR TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY, 45\n\nTCRP COMMITTEE FOR PROJECT J-7\nCHAIR\nJACK REILLY\nCapital District Transportation Authority\nMEMBERS\nGERALD BLAIR\nIndiana County Transit Authority\nKENNETH J.

By tracking specific elements of maintenance,\nmanagers can identify areas that need improvement and allocate resources accordingly. Just as\nmechanics monitor all aspects of an engine to optimize performance, maintenance managers must\nmonitor all aspects of their operations to ensure that labor, equipment, and financial resources are\nused as efficiently as possible.\nAlthough mechanics have specifications with which to measure engine performance,\nmaintenance managers lack guidelines for assessing effectiveness. Without a standard approach,\nmanagers are left to develop their own guidelines, which typically are based on common materials\nthat agencies modify to suit their needs. These materials include service manuals issued by\noriginal equipment manufacturers and a work order system used by most automotive repair shops.\nTo a limited extent, bus maintenance managers also use the National Transit Database (NTD),\nformerly referred to as Section 15. The NTD summarizes an agency's characteristics, including\nannual financial and nonfinancial operating statistics. The NTD, however, lacks detail and was\nnever intended to monitor specific aspects of bus maintenance performance. As a result, most\nagencies must expand on the material required for NTD reporting to supplement their monitoring\nprograms.\nIndividual monitoring programs allow agencies to gauge performance in several areas of bus\nmaintenance. The extent of an agency's monitoring capabilities depends on its commitment and\nresources. Larger agencies tend to have more sophisticated methods for tracking employee\nproductivity and equipment performance, issuing reports that clearly identify cost trends. Smaller\nagencies tend to rely on traditional methods to identify trends, such as reviewing work orders\nmanually. Commitment, arguably the most important component of any monitoring system, is a\nfunction of management's willingness to measure itself and become more efficient.\nRegardless of the monitoring system, it is extremely difficult for an agency to gauge its level\nof maintenance performance with that of another. Different definitions, the unique way each\nagency collects and formats data, and the lack of industry guidance deter interagency comparisons.\nThe inability to make comparisons is somewhat ironic because transit agencies perform near-\nidentical tasks and use similar elements to develop their maintenance monitoring programs.\nThe purpose of this synthesis is to summarize the various approaches transit agencies use to\nmonitor maintenance performance and to describe how performance measures are used to help\nshape maintenance programs. Included are traditional approaches to monitoring and some more\nsophisticated techniques.\nThis synthesis takes a close look at how five public transit agencies and one private trucking\ncompany monitor maintenance performance. A questionnaire was used and site visits were made\nto collect and analyze data. The five transit agencies surveyed were the Ann Arbor (Michigan)\nTransportation Authority (AATA); Central New York Regional Transportation Authority\n(CENTRO), in Syracuse; Milwaukee County Transit System (MCTS); Phoenix Transit System\n(PTS); and VIA Metropolitan Transit (VIA), in San Antonio. The\n\nprivate trucking company surveyed was United Parcel Service (UPS). Maintenance performance\nmonitoring approaches were grouped under four common areas that influence maintenance\nperformance:\n-\nManagement philosophy,\n-\nEmployee productivity,\n-\nEquipment performance, and\n-\nControlling costs.\nThis synthesis does not judge the effectiveness of one particular maintenance performance\nmonitoring approach over another. Instead, it provides a variety of examples of such monitoring\nso that agencies can evaluate them within the framework of their own operations.\n\nCHAPTER ONE\nINTRODUCTION\nMonitoring maintenance performance is essential to all transit\norganizations, especially those that have expensive vehicles to\nmaintain and passenger safety concerns to address. The passenger\nairline industry, in which competition is strong and in-flight failures\ncan be disastrous, monitors maintenance performance against precise\nschedules and procedures (1). In the commercial trucking industry,\nanother industry in which competition is strong, fleet managers\nmonitor maintenance performance to maximize efficiency and\nprofits. In addition, manufacturers monitor maintenance performance\nto improve vehicle design, reliability, and customer satisfaction.\nAs a result of reduced funding, transit organizations are\nrealizing the importance of maintenance performance monitoring as\nthey attempt to improve efficiency and maximize costs. However,\nunlike the larger airline, trucking, and automobile industries, which\nhave the resources to provide detailed guidance on maintenance\nperformance monitoring, the transit industry lacks such resources.\nAlthough all agencies perform similar tasks, they have unique ways\nof monitoring how effective they are at accomplishing these tasks.\nFor example, all transit agencies monitor the frequency of road\ncalls to measure maintenance performance. Some break down the\ncauses of road calls into many categories to identify failure trends,\nwhereas others use only a few categories. Some agencies use the\nFederal Transit Administration (FTA) definition of a road call; others\nuse their own definitions for in-house monitoring purposes. Some\ninvestigate road calls to determine their causes: others do not.\nDespite the differences in approach, monitoring maintenance\nperformance can be a valuable tool if agencies remain consistent in\ntheir approaches. Unfortunately, differences in definitions and how\nperformance data are collected make it difficult to compare the\neffectiveness of an agency's approach to maintenance performance\nmonitoring with that of another.\nPURPOSE AND SCOPE\nThis synthesis summarizes information on maintenance\nperformance monitoring collected from five transit agencies and a\nprivate trucking company in the United States. Information is\norganized by four major elements that influence maintenance\nperformance: management philosophy, employee productivity,\nequipment performance, and controlling costs. In each area, the\nsynthesis\nidentifies\ncommon\nand\ndiffering\napproaches\nto\nmaintenance performance monitoring and highlights some of the\nmore innovative approaches. The synthesis also compares the ways\nin which agencies use performance monitoring results to improve\ntheir maintenance operations.\nAPPROACH\nThis synthesis examines six organizations in detail: five public\ntransit agencies and one private trucking company. Information was\nobtained through a literature search, questionnaire (Appendix A), and\nsite visits made to each organization.\nThe five transit agencies selected were the Ann Arbor\n(Michigan) Transportation Authority (AATA); Central New York\nRegional Transportation Authority, (CENTRO), in Syracuse;\nMilwaukee County Transit System (MCTS); Phoenix Transit System\n(PTS); and VIA Metropolitan Transit (VIA), in San Antonio. These\nagencies were selected based on size, geographic location, and\nunique aspects of their maintenance monitoring programs.\nUnited Parcel Service (UPS) was selected as the private\ntrucking company because of a recommendation made by the\nAmerican Trucking Associations (ATA). According to ATA, UPS is\nan exceptional example of how a private trucking company monitors\nmaintenance performance.\nAnn Arbor Transportation Authority\nWith only 80 buses, AATA is the smallest of the agencies\nsurveyed. The agency's unique approach to maintenance performance\nmonitoring focuses exclusively on the frequency of road calls and\nadherence to preventive maintenance schedules. AATA's shop is\norganized into several two-employee teams that are given a great\ndeal of flexibility in managing their work loads.\nCentral New York Regional Transportation Authority\nCENTRO, based in Syracuse, which is known for its harsh\nwinters, maintains 185 buses from one central facility and two\nsatellite garages. The agency has established a comprehensive set of\ngoals, Key End Results, to measure maintenance performance.\nMilwaukee County Transit System\nThe transit system in Milwaukee County, which experiences\nsevere winters, maintains more than 500 buses from three facilities\nand has adopted a private-side philosophy to monitoring maintenance\nperformance. MCTS uses results of maintenance performance\nmonitoring to compete with outside vendors for unit rebuild work.\n\nPhoenix Transit System\nPTS maintains more than 300 buses in an extremely warm\nclimate. This transit system is a good example of an agency seeking\nto monitor maintenance performance more closely without alienating\nemployees.\nUnited Parcel Service\nUPS' Stratford, Connecticut operation serves as an example of\nhow all U.S.-based delivery vehicles are maintained. The trucking\ncompany subscribes to an empowering philosophy, which gives\nmaintenance employees the freedom to prioritize and schedule work.\nDespite the freedom, UPS moniters worker performance closely to\nmeasure productivity.\nVIA Metropolitan Transit\nVIA maintains more than 500 buses in a warm climate from\none facility and uses an innovative bar coding system to track time\nand productivity. VIA recently changed from a\nmanual maintenance performance monitoring system to a fully\nautomated one.\nORGANIZATION\nChapter 2 of this synthesis, Key Issues in Maintenance\nPerformance Monitoring, describes how key issues were identified,\nquestionnaire development, and the basic sources agencies use to\nestablish their maintenance monitoring programs. Chapter 3,\nSummary of Survey Responses, and chapter 4, Discussion of Survey\nResponses, group survey findings under the four areas common to\nbus maintenance: management philosophy, employee productivity,\nequipment performance, and controlling costs. Appendix B, which\ncontains the individual case studies, groups the information under\neach agency to keep their performance monitoring approach in\nproper context.\nGrouping information by subject (i.e., employee productivity)\nfacilitates analysis of various approaches agencies use to monitor\nmaintenance performance. The case studies describe each agency's\napproach in detail. Conclusions and a summary of findings and\nrecommendations for further study are presented in chapter 5.\n\nCHAPTER TWO\nIDENTIFYING KEY ISSUES IN BUS MAINTENANCE PERFORMANCE\nThis chapter discusses how key issues in maintenance\nperformance monitoring were identified, including the individual\napproaches taken by the agencies surveyed. The chapter also\naddresses the basic sources these agencies use to establish their\nmonitoring programs.\nSURVEY QUESTIONNAIRE\nBasic Elements of Bus Maintenance Performance\nTo identify how agencies monitor maintenance performance, a\nquestionnaire was developed (Appendix A). To ensure that responses\nwere obtained in an organized manner, the questionnaire was\norganized under the four major elements that influence bus\nmaintenance performance:\n-\nManagement philosophy\n-\nEmployee productivity\n-\nEquipment performance\n-\nControlling costs.\nEach of the four elements has a major influence on maintenance\nperformance Management determines how a maintenance department\nwill be organized and sets the policy for how performance will be\nmeasured. Employees provide physical labor, and their productivity\nhas a significant effect on maintenance performance. Maintenance\nemployees practice their craft on buses. The performance of these\nbuses, in turn, is essential in producing the revenue needed to support\nan entire organization. These first three elements--management\nphilosophy, employee productivity, and equipment performance-\nrepresent key elements in maintenance performance.\nAll these elements relate to costs. Although difficult in some\ncases, each aspect of bus maintenance can be monitored through its\nexpense. Because of limited budgets and funding reductions, the final\nand catch-all element of maintenance performance identified was\ncontrolling costs.\nKEY ISSUES IN ELEMENTS OF BUS MAINTENANCE\nPERFORMANCE\nThe next procedure in developing the questionnaire was to\ndetermine the key issues in each of the four elements of maintenance\nperformance. Figure 1 charts this process.\nManagement Philosophy\nThe key issues in management philosophy were identified as\nfollows:\n-\nManagement's\nwillingness\nto\nmonitor\nits\nown\nperformance and set an appropriate example in which to monitor the\nmaintenance organization.\n-\nBalancing\nmanagement\noversight\nwith\nemployee\nresponsibility to create an atmosphere of mutual respect.\n-\nUsing specialized and nonspecialized employees to\ncomplete all tasks as efficiently as possible.\n-\nRewarding employees for exceptional performance to\nmotivate them and correcting their actions to improve performance.\n-\nImproving employee relations and collecting performance\ndata from them through effective communication.\nEmployee Productivity\nFollowing are the key issues identified for employee\nproductivity:\n-\nThe ability of employees to perform their duties according\nto established time and work standards.\n-\nMonitoring an employee's time to determine how\nindividual jobs are accomplished.\n-\nTracking faulty workmanship to individual employees so\nthat it can be corrected and prevented in the future.\n-\nDetermining whether employees are troubleshooting\nproblems correctly or simply changing parts until a problem is\ncorrected.\n-\nEnsuring that employees have the necessary skills to\nperform their duties properly.\nEquipment Performance\nKey issues identified for equipment performance follow:\n-\nEnsuring that an appropriate number of buses are\navailable to meet peak pullout demands.\n-\nControlling the frequency of road calls to maximize\ncustomer acceptance and minimize cost and scheduling disruptions.\n-\nPerforming preventive maintenance (PM) inspections on\ntime to ensure vehicle reliability.\n-\nControlling the frequency of unscheduled maintenance to\nensure an orderly work schedule.\n-\nStandardizing equipment as much as possible to simplify\nmonitoring and other aspects of maintenance.\n-\nInvolving the driver in reporting and accurately\ndescribing vehicle deficiencies.\n-\nEnsuring that all passengers are pleased with the\nmechanical condition of the vehicles to increase ridership and\nrevenue.\n\nControlling Costs\nFollowing are key issues identified for controlling costs:\n-\nProducing and formatting reports based on individual\nmaintenance performance monitoring activities to determine the cost\nof each activity.\n-\nUsing results of maintenance performance monitoring\nreports to make changes to the maintenance operation to improve\nefficiency and lower costs.\n-\nContinuing to monitor maintenance performance to\ndetermine whether changes have reduced costs.\nQUESTIONNAIRE DEVELOPMENT\nAfter the key issues pertaining to the four elements of\nmaintenance performance were identified, the questionnaire was\ndeveloped. Each question was divided into two parts. The first part\nasked respondents how they monitored specific measures of vehicle\nmaintenance performance. The second part asked how respondents\nused the monitoring results. A copy of the questionnaire was mailed\nto each agency selected for the study (Appendix A). A site visit was\nthen made to review the questionnaire and observe how maintenance\nperformance monitoring programs are implemented.\nBASIC SOURCES USED FOR PERFORMANCE\nMONITORING\nEven though agencies develop their own maintenance\nperformance monitoring programs, they typically base these\nprograms on sources available throughout the transit industry.\nSources used to develop in-house monitoring programs consist of the\nfollowing: original equipment manufacturers' (OEM) service\nmanuals; OEM flat-rate manuals; work orders; and the Federal\nTransit Administration (FTA) National Transit Database (NTD),\nformerly called Section 15.\nOEM Service Manuals\nVehicle manufacturers and major component suppliers publish\nservice manuals containing their recommendations for repair and\nmaintenance. These manuals can be extremely detailed, showing\nstep-by-step procedures for troubleshooting and removing, repairing,\nand replacing components. The manuals also contain recommended\nPM intervals. Recommendations provided in OEM service manuals\nhelp agencies formulate their own maintenance procedures and PM\nintervals based on operating conditions, staffing loads, and other\nfactors.\nOEM Flat-Rate Manuals\nTo compensate agencies for repairs done while a vehicle is\nunder warranty, OEMs produce flat-rate manuals. These manuals\ncontain established time intervals for making specific repairs.\nManufacturers use these times to reimburse agencies at a flat rate of\ncompensation for warranty work, regardless of the actual time taken\nby the agency to perform the repair.\nBecause they are used for financial reimbursement, flat-rate\ntimes may be overly optimistic for some employees to achieve,\nespecially if the product is new and unfamiliar to them. Regardless of\nany inherent bias, flat-rate times provide agencies with a starting\npoint from which to establish their own time standards.\nTime allocations make it easier for agencies to schedule work\nand measure employee productivity. As employees become familiar\nwith a product, agencies can readjust time standards accordingly.\nWork Orders\nThe work order, also referred to as a repair order, is the\nbackbone of any maintenance performance monitoring program.\nInformation on all aspects of maintenance performance can be\nobtained from work orders. Agencies with small fleets\n\ncan rely solely on the work order to monitor maintenance\nperformance. For agencies with large fleets, however, this approach\nmay not be practical. Instead, information obtained from the work\norder is entered into a computerized management information system\n(MIS), which summarizes data and identifies recurring problems.\nThe work order usually is initiated by the supervisor, who fills in\npertinent information such as vehicle number, date, mechanic's name\nor identification number, and work to be performed. Mechanics\ncomplete relevant remaining sections of the work order, including\nstart and stop times for each segment of the repair, all parts and fluids\nused, any work deferred, and\n\nother items important to the vehicle's repair history. When the repair\nis complete, clerks enter pertinent information from the work order\ninto the MIS. Bar codes and other electronic systems are sometimes\nused to streamline the data entry process.\nA copy of the work order used by New York City Transit, an\nagency not included in the survey, appears in Figure 2.\nNumerical codes identify vehicle make, reason for the work being\ndone (PM, warranty, accident, etc.), and the part of the vehicle being\nserviced (engine, brakes, tires, etc.).\nOf the organizations surveyed, the Ann Arbor Transportation\nAuthority (AATA) and Central New York Regional Transportation\nAuthority (CENTRO) use a similar work order.\n\nThe work order includes 17 lines of vehicle history, providing\nmechanics with valuable background information to help them\nidentify repeat or related failures. A sample of the work order used\nby AATA appears in Figure 3.\nNational Transit Database\nTo a limited extent, agencies refer to the National Transit\nDatabase (NTD) to compare their maintenance performance with that\nof other agencies. FTA requires that all recipients or beneficiaries of\nurbanized area formula funds submit NTD reports (2) Although NTD\nreports collect operating statistics in a uniform manner, most\nmaintenance managers surveyed use them on a limited basis. The\nprimary reason involves the grouping of expenses into general\ncategories, which are not detailed enough for monitoring specific\naspects of maintenance performance.\nBecause they are required to submit data to FTA, many\nagencies have expanded certain aspects of the NTD system to\ncomplement their in-house maintenance performance monitoring\nprograms. Chapters 3 and 4 reveal how the agencies\nselected for this study classify maintenance performance measures\nand costs into closely defined categories.\nMany agencies have redefined the FTA definition of service\ninterruption (road calls) to suit their needs. They have expanded the\ndefinition to include the specific mechanical problem that resulted in\nthe road call (brakes, alternator. radiator, and the like). Of the\nagencies surveyed, VIA Metropolitan Transit (VIA) and the\nCENTRO use a strict interpretation of FTA's road call definition. The\nothers have modified the definition for their own purposes.\nAs a result of the various road call definitions, many agencies\nprovide information to the NTD in one format and use another for\nmonitoring internal maintenance performance. One example involves\nhow the Phoenix Transit System (PTS) reports air conditioning (A/C)\nfailures. According to NTD requirements, road calls resulting from\nA/C failures are reported under the category \"other reasons\" instead\nof \"mechanical failures.\" However, because of the passenger\ndiscomfort A/C failures create, PTS categorizes such failures as\nmechanical failures for its internal maintenance performance\nmonitoring purposes. PTS, therefore, must report A/C failures under\ntwo\nopposing\ncategories\nto\naccommodate\nNTD\nreporting\nrequirements and its own monitoring system.\n\nCHAPTER THREE\nSUMMARY OF SURVEY RESPONSES\nThe table that follows provides a synthesis of maintenance\nemployee productivity, equipment performance, and controlling\nperformance monitoring approaches used by the five transit agencies\ncosts.

of\nvehicle\nmaintenance\nperformance\nmonitoring:\nmanagement\nphilosophy, employee productivity, equipment performance, and\ncontrolling costs.\nMANAGEMENT PHILOSOPHY\nThe Example Starts at the Top\nMost of the maintenance managers interviewed began their\ncareers as mechanics and understand what it takes to establish a\nproductive atmosphere that motivates employees. VIA Metropolitan\nTransit (VIA), for example, does not believe that employees can be\nproductive unless management is well organized, efficient, and\nwilling to evaluate its own performance. The business approach used\nby the Milwaukee County Transit System (MCTS) to run its\nmaintenance department lets employees know that management is\nserious about productivity and is willing to outsource work if in\nhouse costs are not competitive with those of private vendors.\nHaving a mechanism in place to evaluate management's\neffectiveness shows the entire work force that the agency is\nconcerned about monitoring performance objectively. For example,\nthe\nCentral\nNew\nYork\nRegional\nTransportation\nAuthority\n(CENTRO) created goals, Key End Results, to measure the\nproductivity of management. Each management level employee,\nincluding shift supervisors, the fleet manager, facilities manager, and\nquality control supervisor, must accomplish specific goals, which\nfocus on achieving timely pullouts, adhering to PM schedules,\nreducing repeat failures and road calls, and creating new job\nprocedures. The goals provide a clear understanding of what the\nagency expects from managers and how their performance will be\nmeasured.\nHow Much Oversight?\nEvery maintenance organization has its own view concerning\nthe amount of management oversight required to obtain maximum\nperformance from its work force. One management style favors\nconstant monitoring and supervision of employees. Another opposes\nstringent employee oversight, believing it causes resentment and\ncreates an atmosphere of mutual distrust and animosity. Other styles\nbalance management oversight with employee freedom to achieve\nboth employee satisfaction and productivity.\nBalancing Management Control With Employee Freedom\nThe management dilemma PTS faces as it moves toward a\nmore comprehensive monitoring system is indicative of what\nmany transit managers experience daily. On the one hand, the agency\nwould like to create a team approach that allows mechanics to work\nindependently, without strict management oversight. On the other,\nthe agency does not want a new monitoring system to detract from\nthe level of mutual respect it is trying to establish with employees.\nRegardless of how employees respond to more stringent\nmonitoring, PTS is aware that a comprehensive monitoring system is\nnecessary to verify whether the agency's approach to giving\nemployees more responsibilities and autonomy is working. To make\nits new monitoring system more appealing, PTS management is\ntrying to promote the benefits of measuring productivity, that is,\nbeing able to show measurable performance improvement ensures\njob security for all.\nEmpowering Philosophy\nUPS has undergone a change in management philosophy to\naddress the management oversight versus employee freedom\ndilemma. Once believing that micromanaging its work force was the\nonly way to ensure maximum productivity, the company now\nempowers employees to set priorities and schedule work with\nminimal supervision. Mechanics are given the responsibility for a\nfleet of vehicles, which UPS believes instills pride of ownership and\na greater commitment to quality work. Mechanics use their own\npriorities to schedule repairs and maintenance activities for each\nvehicle. In addition to reducing the number of supervisors, UPS's\nempowering philosophy has reduced absenteeism and job turnover.\nFor additional information on the UPS system of allowing employees\nto prioritize work, see the case study in Appendix B.\nAlthough UPS believes in giving mechanics freedom to\nprioritize and schedule work, it monitors time to the minute to ensure\nmaximum productivity. Regardless of how a mechanic decides to\nschedule work, he or she must meet time allotments established for\nvirtually every repair and maintenance activity. Mechanics use a\nhand-held device to record the time it takes to perform each aspect of\na task. At the end of each week, the total amount of time worked by a\nmechanic must correspond to time standards for each task. A detailed\nreport lists the tasks undertaken by each mechanic and compares the\nactual time used to accomplish these tasks with time standards.\nTeam Approach Gives Employees Maximum Freedom\nWhen it comes to monitoring performance, the Ann Arbor\nTransportation Authority (AATA) has a management philosophy that\nis completely different from those of the other agencies surveyed. Its\nOwnership Program assigns a fleet of about 12\n\nbuses to several two-member teams. Each team is responsible for\nperforming all maintenance tasks on its fleet, except for body repairs.\nTeams are balanced according to personalities, skill levels, and the\nduty cycles of the buses assigned.\nAll teams work on the \"80/20 rule,\" in which 80 percent of a\nteam's time is spent working on assigned buses, while the other 20\npercent of the team's time is spent working on tasks assigned by\nmanagement. Each team, which is assigned a bay and hoist to\nmaintain and repair its fleet, is responsible for retrieving spare parts,\nscheduling work, and setting priorities. The teams help write\ntechnical specifications for new buses, travel to the manufacturing\nplant to inspect buses, and accept new buses as they arrive at the\nfacility. Team members are dispatched to road calls if a bus assigned\nto them fails while in service.\nAATA's team approach has eliminated the need for supervisors.\nAlthough the maintenance manager performs random spot checks\n(thereby filling the role of both manager and supervisor), teams are\nresponsible for their work and perform duties without direct\nsupervision. According to the maintenance manager, mutual respect\nand trust are key to making the team concept work. Balancing the\noversight function with trust and respect provides the greatest\nchallenge. In his opinion, too much management oversight can cause\nresentment, whereas not enough can result in lack of management\ncontrol.\nSpecialized Versus Nonspecialized Work Force\nTransit agencies typically differ in how they assign employees\nto buses, having either a specialized work force or one whose\nmembers can perform a variety of duties. Specialists are proficient in\nspecific technical areas such as air conditioning and heating, engine\nand transmission rebuilding, electrical troubleshooting and repair,\nand brake relining. A nonspecialized work force is one in which\nmechanics rotate from one job to another and therefore must be\nskilled in many areas.\nThose who favor a specialized work force typically believe that\nemployees will be more productive if they work in areas in which\nthey have specific interests and skills. These proponents also believe\nthat employees who concentrate in certain technical areas are better\nequipped to identify failure trends than those who move from one job\nto another. In addition, providing training on new procedures and\ntechnology is simplified because it can be directed to specific\nemployees instead of the entire work force.\nAdvantages cited by managers who favor a nonspecialized\nwork force include the ability to move a greater number of\nemployees into specific work areas, such as engines and brakes, to\nhandle peaks in workload. Rotating employees into different areas on\na regular basis also keeps their skills current in a variety of areas.\nUPS, VIA, and AATA have a general work force, which is\nexpected to work in most maintenance areas, except body repairs.\nVIA periodically rotates employees into different areas, whereas\nUPS and AATA assign mechanics to specific vehicles.\nIncentives and Discipline\nAlthough documented results of incentive programs are not\nwidely available, some transit agencies can demonstrate that such\nprograms have improved productivity (3). Incentives are used to\ncompensate employees for specific accomplishments, in hopes that\nthey will continue to achieve desired performance levels. Most of the\nagencies surveyed use incentive programs, but many claim that they\nare limited by union contracts. Most incentives are used to reward\nemployees for low absenteeism and outstanding safety performance.\nThe range of incentives offered varies. VIA has none, believing\nthat mechanics are motivated by the positive results of their own\nperformance. As a result, VIA posts performance results on bulletin\nboards to show employees how they contribute to the agency's\noverall mission. UPS provides incentives for exceptional road call\nperformance and cash bonuses for good safety performance. AATA\noffers a series of cash incentives for exceptional attendance and\nsafety performance. CENTRO has moved away from cash incentives,\nelecting to provide formal recognition letters and gift awards instead.\nThe agency also ties incentives to the achievement of a group of\nemployees, encouraging positive peer pressure to achieve goals.\nDiscipline\nMost maintenance managers interviewed did not stress\ndiscipline as a way to punish employees for unsatisfactory\nperformance. Instead, they focus on bringing productivity related\nissues directly to the employee's attention and concentrate on\nretraining.\nCENTRO specifically addresses discipline in its Rules and\nRegulations Handbook, which is given to all maintenance employees\n(4). Next to each rule and regulation is a reference to a specific\ndisciplinary\ncode.\nDisciplinary\nactions\ninclude\nwarnings,\nsuspensions, and automatic discharges.\nMCTS uses a process in its unit rebuild shop that could be\nconsidered a form of discipline. If in-house costs are not consistently\ncompetitive with private vendors, work may be outsourced. As with\nother industries, outsourcing is a sensitive subject in the transit\nindustry as unions struggle for job security and management seeks to\nbecome more cost-efficient.\nEmployee Relations and\nCommunication\nAll agencies surveyed expressed a need and willingness to\nestablish strong working relationships with employees. Because most\nmanagers began their careers as mechanics, they identify with their\nemployees. As a result, they tend to enlist employees' help in solving\nproblems. Management also encourages employees to suggest more\nefficient ways of maintaining the fleet, thereby creating an\natmosphere of mutual respect. Management is aware of how an\nuninspired and unmotivated work force can reduce productivity.\n\nWritten Feedback\nEach agency encourages mechanics to communicate unique\naspects of repairs in their own words. Work orders that provide\nenough space for comments, suggestions, and other information are\ncommonly used. Knowing that PTS management reviews work\norders, mechanics highlight certain comments to call attention to\nparticular issues. When VIA moved from a manual data collection\nsystem to an automated one, management insisted on a method to\ncapture a mechanic's written comments.\nVerbal Communication on the\nShop Floor\nEach\nagency\nsurveyed\nencourages\nverbal\nlines\nof\ncommunication with maintenance employees as they work on\nvehicles. The intent in all cases is to obtain valuable feedback on job\nprocedures, vehicle peculiarities, and other aspects of maintenance.\nBecause it cannot justify a research and development department,\nCENTRO relies heavily on its mechanics to help solve equipment\nrelated problems. Mechanics are made to feel part of a team to help\nimprove efficiency and reduce costs. As a result of this relationship,\njob satisfaction is high and employee turnover is low. The average\nmaintenance employee has worked at the agency for 11 years.\nVIA supplements its computerized data collection system by\nencouraging management to communicate with mechanics on the\nshop floor. Managers talk to specialized and nonspecialized\nemployees on a regular basis, listening to their suggestions,\nacknowledging their interpretation of a particular problem, observing\nthe quality of their work, and creating an atmosphere of mutual\nrespect.\nNewsletters and Meetings\nMCTS produces an in-house newsletter, Maintenance News,\nwhich keeps employees informed on a variety of issues ranging from\nbus maintenance and technology to work productivity. PTS instructs\nsupervisors to improve communication skills by becoming people-\noriented and not relying solely on the \"bulletin board approach.\" For\nexample, to show their concern and obtain driver feedback on bus\nperformance, PTS foremen and mechanics greet bus drivers weekly\nas they return from their routes.\nA new program at PTS has been established to improve\ncommunication with mechanics. Mechanics meet weekly with\nmanagement to address technical problems, along with labor and\nquality issues. A project status memorandum, which lists the status of\nwork priorities by bus type, is discussed during the meetings.\nAccording to the agency, the memorandum is an effective way to\nprioritize work by involving the entire maintenance department.\nVIA meets with each employee on a periodic basis to review\nyear-to-date attendance records and parts usage and to show each\nemployee how he or she spent each minute of each\nworkday during the previous week. Management does not attempt to\ncriticize or correct employees at these meetings. Instead,\nmanagement communicates individual performance results to show\nemployees that it is aware of their activities.\nBulletin Boards\nMost of the agencies surveyed use a bulletin board to\ncommunicate road call performance results, lost time due to illness\nand injury, and cost-per-mile trends to maintenance employees. The\nbulletin boards also are used to display photos of employees who\nhave won safety awards and Employee of the Month honors and who\nhave accomplished other achievements.\nEMPLOYEE PRODUCTIVITY\nWork Procedures and Time Standards\nMost of the agencies surveyed expect maintenance employees\nto adhere to written procedures for performing routine tasks. These\nprocedures usually are accompanied by time standards representing\nthe average time required to complete a task. Work procedures\nensure that repairs will be performed according to an agency's quality\nrequirements, and time standards allow management to better\nschedule maintenance activities and compare individual employee\nproductivity with established norms.\nOf the agencies surveyed, PTS and AATA are the only ones\nthat do not require employees to adhere to established work\nprocedures or time standards. Once its new MIS is operational,\nhowever, PTS will incorporate job procedures and time standards\ninto its maintenance performance monitoring program. AATA is not\nconcerned with prescribing how maintenance tasks are performed.\nInstead, the agency monitors PM schedules and road call intervals to\ndetermine productivity. For more information on the AATA team\napproach, see the AATA case study in Appendix B.\nWork Standards\nThe level of detail in work standards ranges from an outline of\nhow tasks should be performed to extremely detailed, step-by-step\ndescriptions. Some of the more detailed procedures include safety\nprecautions, a list of required tools, and instructions for disposing\nhazardous materials. Some work procedures at UPS include\nchecklists for each task so that one mechanic can pick up where\nanother left off.\nMany agencies use OEM service manuals as a basis for\nestablishing their own work procedures. Some larger agencies,\nhowever, have the resources to develop highly specialized\nprocedures. An industrial engineer employed by MCTS, for example,\nhas conducted time and motion studies for approximately 70 percent\nof all maintenance jobs. Repetitive tasks such as removing and\nreplacing components, performing\n\ntuneups, relining brakes, and conducting PM inspections have been\nstudied. MCTS publishes a work procedure and time study that\nguides employees through tasks as efficiently as possible.\nAfter examining the brake relining procedure, MCTS's\nindustrial engineer found that it was more productive to include a\nhelper on the job. This allows the brake specialists to focus on the\nspecialized aspects of a repair while the helper assists with routine\ntasks.\nVIA organizes its work procedures in four booklets and uses\nthem as training guides for entry-level mechanics (5). Because VIA's\nexperienced mechanics wrote the procedures, they are allowed to\naccomplish tasks in their own manner as long as the basic steps and\nsafety procedures are followed. If faulty workmanship is found, the\nwritten procedures are used to redirect employee's efforts.\nTime Standards\nTime standards typically are based on those listed in OEM flat-\nrate manuals. Manufacturers establish OEM flat-rate times, the\naverage amount of time expected to complete particular tasks, to\nreimburse customers for warranty repairs. Agencies often use flat-\nrate times as a starting point, adjusting them as needed to reflect the\naverage skill level of its work force.\nCENTRO, for example, uses OEM flat-rate times, but works\nclosely with mechanics to establish realistic time intervals for\ncompleting tasks. Once ways are found to reduce a time interval,\nhowever, the overall time allotted for a particular procedure is not\nreduced. Instead, other tasks are added to the procedure to improve\nvehicle reliability and reduce unscheduled maintenance. In addition,\nCENTRO informs employees of the recommended time interval for\ncompleting a task beforehand to affirm what is expected of them.\nBased on its time standards, MCTS establishes production\nschedules for its unit rebuild shop. A printout informs supervisors of\nthe number of units required to maintain inventory levels, along with\nthe time needed to rebuild the units. The supervisor then assigns a\nspecific number of rebuilds to each mechanic and informs him or her\nof the time requirements for completing the rebuilds. This ensures\nthat employees know exactly what management expects of them.\nVIA, because of its policy to rotate employees into different\nmechanical areas, uses time standards in another way. Despite its\nability to monitor time accurately, the agency does not compare the\ntime used by one individual with that of another. Instead, it compares\neach employee to his or her past performance to determine if\nimprovements are being made. VIA realizes that individuals may be\nproficient in specific areas and not so capable in others. VIA believes\nthat it is the performance an employee displays in all technical areas\ncollectively that represents the true measure of productivity.\nThe existence of time standards, combined with a detailed\nmonitoring system, allows UPS to give its mechanics freedom to\nprioritize work and complete tasks in any order they choose. At the\nend of the week, however, management compares an\nemployee's time with work performed, expecting a specific level of\nproductivity.\nMonitoring Time\nWork Orders\nMost agencies use work orders to monitor the amount of time\nemployees spend on particular maintenance activities. Some use a\npunch-in-style time clock to enter start and stop times. Others allow\nmechanics to simply write down these times. Data entry clerks\ntypically enter the repair description and time into the agency's MIS,\nin which data are stored and formatted into reports. Agencies with\nless sophisticated procedures review each work order manually to\nidentify excessive use of time. Others review MIS reports and work\norders.\nIn addition to recording the time a mechanic takes for a\ncompleting a particular maintenance activity, some agencies divide\nrepairs into specific time segments. This more detailed approach\nallows management to determine whether employees are having\ndifficulty in a specific area of the repair, such as troubleshooting,\nremoving the part, or reinstalling the part. By understanding\nemployees' difficulties, management can direct training to correct the\ndeficiency and adjust time standards to reflect working conditions\nand employee skill levels.\nVIA and UPS Approach\nTo obtain a more accurate accounting of how employees use\ntime, VIA and UPS have developed sophisticated electronic\nmonitoring systems. UPS mechanics use a hand-held device, a\npersonal digital assistant (PDA), and VIA mechanics use a bar\ncoding system. Both provide a detailed accounting of an employee's\nactivities throughout the day.\nUPS's PDA is a readily available, off-the-shelf device that\nmechanics use to record activities throughout the day Although the\npocket-size PDA is easily found in most electronics stores, the\ncompany-developed software used to run the system is proprietary.\nBefore beginning a job, an employee enters the following\ninformation:\n-\nSocial security number;\n-\nTime at which a job is started and finished;\n-\nNumber of the vehicle being serviced;\n-\nType of maintenance or repair activity (based on a series\nof codes) being performed; and\n-\nAll parts used in the repair process.\nData are stored in the PDA until the end of the day, when they are\ndownloaded into the MIS.\nAccording to UPS, PDAs allow mechanics to follow their self-\ndirected work schedules and take pride in meeting them. The\ncomputerized system also creates for UPS a permanent record of\nvehicle history to satisfy U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT)\nrequirements. In addition, the time monitoring system provides the\ncompany with a permanent work record by which to hold mechanics\naccountable for their actions.\n\nVIA has a different approach; it uses a bar coding system to\ntrack labor and parts. The agency first began using bar codes for\npayroll accounting purposes on a limited basis in its electronic repair\nshop. Once the bar coding system was optimized, VIA began\napplying the system to its mainstream maintenance operation. A\nseries of bar codes, affixed to employees' time cards, work orders,\nparts requisition forms, and standard job descriptions, record each\naspect of the repair, allowing VIA to monitor specific areas of its\nmaintenance operation. From the data, VIA can identify whether\nemployees are having difficulties in specific areas and direct its\nefforts to help them.\nThe bar coding system works as follows:\n-\nThe mechanic clocks onto a job by scanning the bar code\nlabel on his or her payroll identification card and the bar code label\non the work order. This ties the mechanic to the repair.\n-\nThe mechanic also scans the appropriate repair code from\na book of descriptions centrally located on the shop floor, adjacent to\nthe time clock (Figure 4).\n-\nAll information, including the mechanic's identification\nnumber, starting time, and type of repair are logged into VIA's\ntracking system and tied to a specific work order.\n-\nIf a part is needed, another bar code entry adds it to the\nwork order. Inventory levels are automatically adjusted to\ncompensate for parts used in the repair.\n-\nThe mechanic continues to enter bar codes into the work\norder until all aspects of the repair are complete.\n-\nA clerk closes the job by scanning the bar coded label on\nthe work order and enters any handwritten information that the\nstandard list of repair codes did not adequately describe.\nFor a complete description of the VIA bar coding system, refer to the\nVIA case study in Appendix B.\nFacility Layout\nThe way in which a maintenance facility is organized plays an\nimportant role in employee productivity. Inconvenient locations for\nparts rooms, restrooms, special tools and other shop items can extend\nthe amount of time an employee spends on repairs.\nDesigned more than 46 years ago, the maintenance facility used\nby VIA serves as a good example of how a shop layout can\ncontribute to employee productivity (Figure 5). The facility is\norganized into five work areas. Each area includes a series of work\nbays along with the equipment needed to support a particular\nmaintenance activity. During peak service periods when buses are on\nthe road, mechanics work in the support area rebuilding units. During\noff-peak periods they move to the adjacent work bays to install these\nunits on buses or to perform inspections.\nThe foreman offices, director's office, and storeroom are\ncentrally located, with large windows for visibility. Because the\nfacility was designed with few solid structures protruding\n\nabove the floor, management can easily observe employees\nthroughout the entire shop.\nTracking Faulty Workmanship Through\nRepeat Failures\nMost of the agencies surveyed are limited in their ability to\ntrace faulty workmanship to the responsible employee. This ability\ndepends on how the agency is structured, its monitoring capabilities,\nand its process for generating reports. Agencies with immediate\naccess to data and higher staffing levels have an easier time tracking\nfaulty workmanship. Those with manual work order filing systems\nand limited staff have a more difficult time.\nFor agencies that assign buses to specific employees, the task of\ntracing faulty workmanship becomes easier. At AATA, for example,\nteam members assigned to a bus that needs road service are required\nto retrieve the bus and make the necessary repairs. UPS also assigns\nspecific mechanics to vehicles, simplifying the task of linking faulty\nworkmanship to an individual.\nFor agencies that do not assign mechanics to buses, a popular\nway of tracing faulty workmanship to the responsible employee\ninvolves monitoring repeat failures. Repeat failures, which are\ncaused by faulty workmanship or component failure, occur because\nthe underlying failure was not diagnosed properly (6). Most of the\nagencies surveyed generate repeat failure reports, which link\nreoccurring problems to individual buses and specific bus fleets (i.e.,\nthose of the same make and model).\nIf faulty workmanship is the cause of repeat failures,\nmanagement can search its files manually or through MIS-generated\nreports to determine who handled the particular repair. Management\ncan then bring the faulty workmanship to the individual's attention\nand determine the cause. Not doing so only allows the condition to\ncontinue, thereby increasing the frequency of road calls and\nunscheduled maintenance.\nWhen CENTRO noticed an increase in repeat failures for\nelectrical repairs, it prepared a detailed work procedure for\ntroubleshooting major electrical components. The agency also\nspecified additional electrical training to be provided as part of its\nnext bus order. PTS experienced a similar rise in repeat failures for\ngenerators and developed a detailed training program to improve\nemployee electrical diagnostic skills, especially those pertaining to\ncharging systems. MCTS uses repeat failure data to specify certain\ncomponents for new bus procurements, avoiding designs with high\nrepeat failure rates.\nBoth CENTRO and AATA use a work order system that prints\n17 lines of repair history when the work order is generated for a\nspecific bus (Figure 3). This provides mechanics with valuable\ninformation to determine if they are working on the problem for the\nfirst time or handling a repeat failure. At both agencies, mechanics\ncan access additional information through a centrally located\ncomputer terminal\nVIA uses its bar coding system and MIS to monitor the amount\nof parts used by individual mechanics. Management reviews reports\nto identify mechanics who continually use an excessive number of\nreplacement parts. The mechanics are then questioned to determine if\nthe cause is due to their inability to diagnose a fault properly.\nHiring, Training, and Advancement\nHiring\nWhenever possible, agencies hire employees with the necessary\nskills to reduce the time and expense associated with in-house\ntraining. UPS, for example, hires journeymen mechanics and sends\nthem to a mandatory 22-day program to learn the company's methods\nand procedures. Update training is performed by district trainers who\ntravel to each location.\nAgencies that hire unskilled employees typically start them out\nat entry-level positions, training them by means of classroom and on-\nthe-job instruction. Most of the agencies surveyed administer a\nscreening test to all applicants for maintenance positions. The\nprocess identifies those with both the desire and aptitude to learn\nmechanical skills. Maintenance employees at CENTRO and VIA, for\nexample, typically start out as cleaners and servicers and work up\nthrough the ranks.\n\nTraining\nAll of the agencies surveyed have in-house training programs,\nalthough most are feeling the effects of budget reductions. MCTS,\nfor example, has reduced its in-house training program and tries to\nhire qualified mechanics whenever possible. In-house training for\npromotions, previously held during normal work hours, has been\ndiscontinued and now takes place outside the employee's normal\nwork hours. In-house programs only address remedial, new\nequipment, and update training\nPTS has taken a different approach, creating its University\nSchool of Management to provide employees with leadership skills.\nThe school's objective is to transform management into a flexible and\ncustomer-focused team. As a result of the training, PTS plans to\nmonitor managers' performance, expecting them to improve\nemployee morale and improve customer service.\nCENTRO was part of a New York consortium that hired a\nprofessional training institute to conduct on-site maintenance training\nat several agencies. Now that the program is over and training\nbudgets reduced, management relies on bus manufacturers and\nequipment suppliers to help develop training that addresses specific\nproblems.\nUPS and VIA train senior mechanics to become maintenance\ninstructors. VIA selected 10 of its highly skilled mechanics with an\ninterest in training and hired a consultant to teach them how to teach.\nThe 10 instructors were divided into two groups and given the task of\nwriting four job procedure booklets (5). Instructors use the written\nprocedures as a guide to instruct entry-level mechanics as they work\non jobs. The booklets also are used to test the abilities of mechanics\nafter each segment of the training is complete.\nTo help shape their training programs, many agencies use\nhistorical data on repeat failures, service interruptions, excessive use\nof time, and unscheduled maintenance to identify specific areas that\ncould benefit from focused training. In addition, agencies use these\ndata to specify training programs that OEMs must provide as part of\nnew bus procurements.\nAdvancement\nAgencies use different methods to promote maintenance\nemployees from one level to another. In addition to conducting\ntraining, the consultant hired by AATA developed a merit-based\nsystem for advancement. The system provides a step-by-step written\nexplanation of the procedures needed to progress from one grade\nlevel to the next. Each job level is defined, and the training and\ntesting procedures required for advancement are described.\nEmployees can advance at their own pace, based on the results of\nwritten, oral, and hands-on testing. Once the merit-based\nadvancement system was in place, the consultant turned the program\nover to AATA's training instructor to administer.\nUPS encourages its mechanics to advance through the ranks\nand eventually join management. Once an employee advances to the\nmanagement level, a career planning guide is\nreviewed annually to establish professional career paths. UPS\noperates its own management training school that teaches corporate\nphilosophy, leadership skills, quality concepts, people skills, business\ntheory, and other managerial skills. The school is much like a\nuniversity campus, providing students with an appropriate setting in\nwhich to learn.\nPTS starts its entry-level mechanics at 50 percent of the highest\npay scale. The mechanics work themselves up in 10 percent salary\nincrements based on years of service and training. Once they reach\n80 percent of the top pay scale, the mechanics must take a series of\ntests to progress any further. At MCTS, promotions are based on a\nbattery of practical, written, and validated tests, with seniority being\nthe tie breaker for qualified employees. Employees can bypass the\ntests and still be promoted by taking and passing approved classes at\nvocational and technical schools.\nEQUIPMENT PERFORMANCE\nAnother important element in maintenance monitoring is\nequipment performance, including on-time performance for meeting\npeak pullouts, frequency of road calls, adherence to PM schedules,\nand customer acceptance. Because employee productivity and\nequipment performance are interrelated, agencies must use\nperformance monitoring data carefully to distinguish between the\ntwo. The ability to determine whether a mechanical failure was\ncaused by a malfunction of the equipment or through faulty\nworkmanship is the true test of an effective maintenance\nperformance monitoring system.\nMost equipment performance monitoring activities result in\nadditional work being added to maintenance. For example, in the\ncase of recurring equipment failures, agencies generally add new\ntasks during PM inspections or initiate repair campaigns. Both are\nintended to address problems before they escalate into more serious\nones.\nOne example involves a rise in premature brake wear that\nappeared to occur in cycles on all VIA buses. Enlisting the assistance\nof students from Incarnate Word College, the premature brake wear\nwas linked to prolonged periods of rain. The severe rain produced\nlarge puddles of standing water, which was carried into brake\ncomponents, causing a spike in repairs to follow about 30 days later.\nTo address the problem, VIA now schedules a separate PM program\nimmediately after prolonged periods of rain to flush the brake\nsystems.\nIn other cases, equipment monitoring reduces an agency's work\nload. By using oil analysis to monitor the condition of internal engine\ncomponents, CENTRO extended oil change intervals on its\ncompressed natural gas (CNG) buses because of the engine's cleaner\ncombustion process. Approval to extend the interval was supported\nby the engine manufacturer.\nVehicle Availability for Revenue Service\nEnsuring that enough buses are available to meet peak service\ndemands (i.e., pullouts) is essential. Above the number of buses\nneeded for peak service, a certain percentage of the\n\nfleet is required as spares to accomplish required maintenance and\nrepairs. The vehicle/spare ratio, recommended by the Federal Transit\nAdministration (FTA) to be 20 percent, is another measure of an\nagency's overall performance (i.e., the more vehicles down for\nrepairs, the higher the vehicle/spare ratio). Respondents to a\nTransportation Research Board (TRB) survey indicated that\nimproved maintenance techniques would help them reduce the\nnumber of spare vehicles needed (7). Of those surveyed, the\nvehicle/spare ratio ranged from 7 percent to 20 percent.\nTo control the availability of buses, most of the agencies\nsurveyed place that responsibility with the maintenance department.\nAt VIA, for example, all buses returning from service must stop at a\nkiosk, where an employee enters bus availability information into the\nMIS in one of two categories: those in need of servicing or repair and\nthose that can go back into service after receiving fuel and routine\ndaily servicing. Once a bus is taken out of service for repair, it is\nnoted as unavailable. After the repair is complete, the bus is placed in\nthe available category. This allows both operations and maintenance\nat VIA to know current fleet availability.\nRoad Calls\nMonitoring road calls, or service interruptions as some agencies\ncall them, is arguably the single most important indicator of an\nagency's overall performance. The term \"road call\" stems from the\npractice of dispatching a service vehicle to repair or retrieve a vehicle\non the road. In other cases, a vehicle may encounter a delay caused\nby a malfunction but may be able to continue service-hence the term\n\"service interruption \" In any case, these terms are not well defined,\nand many agencies use them interchangeably. For the purposes of\nthis synthesis, any problem encountered while a vehicle is in service\nwill be referred to as a road call.\nVirtually every agency classifies road calls into separate\nsubsystems of the bus, such as engine, body, and brakes, that caused\nthe failure. Classifying failures into specific bus subsystems allows\nagencies to identify trends, determine the underlying cause of the\nproblem, and take the appropriate action to correct it\nIndustry Lacks Standard\nDefinition\nAlthough FTA has established a definition of a road call for the\npurposes of National Transit Database (NTD) (formerly Section 15)\nreporting, a road call definition accepted by all agencies does not\nexist. As mentioned in chapter 2, agencies often use one definition\nfor FTA reporting purposes and another to suit their own\nrequirements. Of the agencies surveyed, VIA and CENTRO use the\nFTA definition for their in-house monitoring programs. The others\nhave adopted separate definitions. For example, some agencies do\nnot count a road call if it was caused by an air conditioning or\nfarebox failure or if the failed component is covered by warranty.\nConsistency Allows Intra-Agency\nMonitoring\nDespite the various definitions of road call, each agency can\nmeasure equipment performance by using its own definition\nconsistently. One of the more basic definitions is the straightforward\none used by UPS, which defines a road call as any activity to help a\ndriver who needs mechanical assistance to continue service. Road\ncalls are tracked by \"car day,\" which equals one day of delivery\nservice per vehicle. UPS averages one road call per 300 car days,\nwith the goal of reducing that number to one road call for every 500\ncar days of service. Road calls are categorized in several different\nways, including breakdown by driver, fault, vehicle, and mechanic.\nUPS uses its road call reports to identify trends in employee\nproductivity and equipment performance.\nMCTS, typical of many agencies, classifies road calls as either\nchargeable or nonchargeable. Loosely defined, \"chargeable\" signifies\nthat the call could have been prevented, whereas \"nonchargeable\"\nindicates\nprevention\nwas\nnot\npossible.\nIn\nMCTS's\ncase,\nnonchargeable road calls include those caused by a part that failed\nunder warranty, fareboxes, destination signs, tires, vandalism, lights,\nand passenger illness. In 1996, the agency's goal was to attain not\nless than 3,000 mi between road calls.\nTo achieve its road call goal, MCTS wrote an action plan. In it,\nthe agency monitors the cause of every road call to determine\nproblem trends and initiate a course of action to resolve the problem.\nThe plan calls for all scheduled brake inspections, minor inspections,\nand air conditioning inspections to be performed on time.\nRoad call monitoring is important at AATA because it is one of\nonly two measures used to evaluate employee productivity and\nequipment performance. The agency considers all road calls as\nchargeable, except those caused by fareboxes, destination signs,\npassenger illness, and tires. If a road call occurs, a team is\nresponsible for retrieving the bus and making the necessary repairs.\nIn doing so, team members gain firsthand knowledge of what caused\nthe failure so that they can prevent it from recurring.\nTo assist team members, AATA provides them with a report\nshowing the number of chargeable road calls and the mean distance\nbetween each. An annual accounting of chargeable road calls by the\nagency is shown in Figure 6. The average age of the bus fleet, a key\nfactor that must be considered when evaluating road call\nperformance, is 7.9 years.\nPreventive Maintenance Intervals\nPM is scheduled on a periodic basis to inspect bus components,\nmake adjustments, replace lubricating fluids, and care for the bus's\nmechanical system. As the term implies, the maintenance activity is\nintended to prevent failures. The intervals at which maintenance is\nperformed can be based on time, mileage, or a combination of both,\ndepending on an agency's approach. Most use service manuals and\nrecommendations provided by OEMs as a basis for establishing PM\nprograms and modifying them to suit their needs.\n\nScheduled Versus Unscheduled Maintenance\nMaintenance activities can be classified in two general\ncategories: scheduled (i.e., accomplished within a planned service\ninterval) or unscheduled (falling between scheduled service\nintervals). Although precise definitions do not exist, scheduled\nmaintenance consists of planned activities including PM inspections,\nplanned component repair or replacement, driver inspections, and\nother planned inspections. Unscheduled maintenance activities result\nfrom breakdowns caused by component failures and from defects\nfound during scheduled inspections.\nMost agencies monitor unscheduled maintenance as another\nindication of equipment performance. Although unscheduled\nmaintenance never can be eliminated, its frequency and duration can\nbe controlled (8). Increases in unscheduled maintenance, typically\nclassified into specific bus systems (i.e., engines and brakes), alerts\nmanagers to look for the underlying cause so that the problem can be\ncorrected. For example, when faced with an increase in unscheduled\nelectrical related maintenance activities, CENTRO initiated a\nseparate PM inspection for bus electrical systems. The inspection\nforced mechanics to look at specific trouble spots in electrical\nsystems on a regular basis to reduce the frequency of unscheduled\nmaintenance. Moving maintenance into the scheduled category gives\nmanagers greater control and improves the structure of their\noperations.\nMonitoring Ensures Adherence to PM Schedules\nPM is only effective if it is performed according to a specified\ntime or mileage interval. To ensure that its PM schedules\nare met, UPS provides mechanics with a PMI (Preventive\nMaintenance Inspection) schedule and non-compliance report The\nreport lists vehicles that need PM in order of priority, beginning with\nvehicles whose PM is overdue. The report includes the date at which\nthe PM should be performed to remain on schedule, along with the\nremaining mileage and the date when the last PM was performed.\nSupervisors use this report to determine whether mechanics are\nadhering to PM schedules.\nAt AATA, where adherence to PM schedules is one of the two\ncriteria used to evaluate employee performance, each team receives a\nreport showing the mileage remaining until the next scheduled PM\ninspection for each bus. Team members review this report on a\nregular basis to prioritize and schedule their work. Once an\ninspection is complete, the team remains with the bus to finish any\nunscheduled work discovered as part of the inspection process.\nVIA believes that once a detailed PM program is established\nand followed on a regular basis the rest will take care of itself. To\nadhere to a PM interval of 5500 mi, VIA determined that it needed to\naccomplish 11 inspections per day. To achieve this, VIA issues a\nmonthly report that indicates whether the PM goal is being met.\nFigure 7 illustrates VIA's performance in achieving its stated goal.\nEquipment Standardization\nThose who believe in equipment standardization claim that it\nsimplifies training and helps identify failure trends. Others claim that\nstandardization is not important. Despite the differences,\n\nprocurement policies make it difficult for many agencies to\nstandardize their fleets. Although it has a variety of bus models,\nAATA practices a form of standardization by assigning teams to\nspecific bus models.\nCENTRO, which operates a fleet of 185 buses with 12 different\nmodels, has a greater monitoring challenge than an agency with only\na few bus models. At VIA, for example, equipment standardization\nhas played a key role in simplifying performance monitoring. The\nmajority of buses are General Motors RTS-style advanced design\nbuses powered by Detroit Diesel Corporation 71-Series engines. As\nanother example of VIA's belief in standardization, when a solution\nis found to a particular problem, the solution is applied to every bus.\nThe approach keeps all buses identical, making them easier to\nmaintain and supply parts for.\nDespite the engineering resources available to UPS, the\ncompany has come full circle on vehicle specifications. Instead of\nissuing detailed hardware specifications, the company now procures\noff-the-shelf vehicles and components whenever possible. As one\nUPS manager stated, \"our business is delivering packages, not\nbuilding\nvehicles.\"\nAccording\nto\nUPS,\nits\nmove\ntoward\nstandardization has resulted in lower vehicle maintenance costs and\nimproved parts availability.\nDriver Involvement\nObtaining accurate information from drivers concerning vehicle\ncondition is essential to maintenance performance\nmonitoring. Drivers spend extended periods of time in a bus and, if\nproperly trained, can provide valuable feedback. Law requires that\nholders of commercial drivers licenses (CDL) conduct a pretrip\ninspection and note any defects before boarding passengers (9). A\ndefect card, typically left on every bus, must be completed, signed,\nand returned by the driver after each run.\nIn addition to fulfilling CDL requirements, CENTRO goes a\nstep further by encouraging drivers to write up defects. To follow up\non repairs to correct problems reported by drivers, the maintenance\ndepartment sends them a Problem Correction Card, which explains\nhow the reported problem was addressed. Maintenance personnel\nalso are willing to spend time on the road with drivers to pinpoint an\nintermittent problem.\nVIA is planning a similar system. When drivers report a defect,\nthey will be informed of the corrective action the next time the bus is\nassigned to them. In both cases, drivers are made to feel that their\ninput is valued.\nBecause drivers and mechanics are assigned specific vehicles,\nUPS encourages them to communicate with each other. The company\nis experimenting with a program in which drivers grade how well the\nvehicle was serviced, which is similar to the response cards used by\nautomobile dealers. The intent of the program is to view the driver as\nthe shop's internal customer.\n\nCustomer Acceptance\nProviding service that is pleasing to passengers is essential to\nevery transit operation. All transit agencies surveyed have a method\nof receiving feedback from passengers. Most consist of passenger\nsurveys. The city of Phoenix, which contracts for service with PTS,\nconducts an extensive passenger survey every other year. The survey\ntakes a month to complete. In addition to this survey, the agency's\nmarketing department conducts its own surveys to obtain passenger\nfeedback in specific areas.\nCENTRO uses a novel approach to gauge the performance of\nits buses while they are in service. The agency requires maintenance\nsupervisors and managers to ride buses on a monthly basis to gain\nfirsthand\nexperience\nof\ncustomer\nacceptance,\nride\nquality,\ncleanliness, and mechanical operation. The Employee Ridership\nInformation Card in Figure 8 is used by management to monitor bus\nperformance.\nCONTROLLING COSTS\nControlling costs is the true test of an agency's ability not only\nto monitor maintenance performance effectively, but also to put the\nmonitoring results to work. All other elements of maintenance\nperformance\nmonitoring--management\nphilosophy,\nemployee\nproductivity and equipment performance--affect costs. Despite their\nown approaches, agencies that measure the following are controlling\ncosts:\n-\nManagement's ability to promote employee satisfaction\nand create an atmosphere in which employees feel part of an overall\neffort to improve efficiency;\n-\nThe distribution of how an employee spends his or her\ntime, including the ability to trace faulty workmanship, repeat\nfailures, and diagnostic time;\n-\nComparing the time it takes an employee to accomplish a\ntask within established intervals;\n-\nThe distribution of parts used in the repair or maintenance\nactivity;\n-\nThe skill level of each employee and the ability to direct\ntraining where needed to improve skill levels;\n-\nBus availability for peak pullouts and other equipment\nperformance measures, including frequency of road calls and\nunscheduled maintenance activities;\n-\nAdherence to established PM intervals;\n-\nDriver's ability to identify potential mechanical problems\nand accurately describe faulty conditions; and\n-\nCustomer satisfaction with bus equipment.\nCost Reports\nThis study did not attempt to document each agency's\nmaintenance budget and actual cost savings resulting from employee\nperformance monitoring. However, each of the agencies surveyed\ndoes produce cost reports that are derived from their maintenance\nperformance monitoring programs. Their cost analysis reports are\nused for budgeting and gauging the effectiveness of a particular\nmaintenance approach in controlling costs. For example, to\ndetermine if its in-house rebuilding was more cost-effective than\noutsourcing, MCTS developed a detailed monitoring program, which\nis based on a two-part identification tag that tracks the mechanical\ncosts of each rebuild unit throughout its life. Based on these data,\n\nMCTS rebuilds components in-house only if it is cost-effective (i.e.,\nif it is less expensive than a vendor's charge to rebuild them) For a\ncomplete description of MCTS's rebuild program, see the case study\nin Appendix B).\nLarger agencies tend to have more detailed cost reporting\ncapabilities than smaller agencies. Regardless of the reports'\nsophistication, agencies use them as a benchmark by which to gauge\nmaintenance performance. Some agencies have specific cost\nreduction goals to achieve (generally around 10 percent). One\nagency, which had its maintenance budget reduced, believes that it\nhas achieved a reduction if performance levels remain on par with\nprevious years.\nFollowing are examples of cost reports obtained from the\nsurvey:\n-\nCost per mile--Includes the total maintenance cost per\nrevenue service mile operated, classified by labor, parts, fuel, oil, and\nother cost center categories.\n-\nCost per seated capacity--Includes the total maintenance\ncost per bus seat, classified by labor and parts.\n-\nVandalism costs--Includes total cost of damage caused by\nvandalism classified by bus type and type of damage (e.g., windows\nand seats).\n-\nDirect versus indirect labor--Includes the number of hours\nlisted on work orders versus the total number of hours for which\nmaintenance employees are paid.\n-\nOverall labor allocation--Shows how overall maintenance\nlabor hours were distributed for the week, month, and year. Labor\nclassifications include PM inspections, brake/air systems service, air\nconditioning service, lunch, meetings, holidays, and vacations.\n-\nIndividual labor allocation--Itemizes each mechanic's\ntime including time spent on diagnostics, time to obtain parts, and\ntime to complete the repair.\n-\nScheduled\nversus\nunscheduled\nmaintenance\nlabor\nallocation--Includes a breakdown of labor used for scheduled\nmaintenance activities versus unexpected activities that arose\nbetween scheduled maintenance intervals.\n-\nLost attendance hours--Includes the number of hours lost\neach day due to illness, occupational circumstances, personal\nreasons, vacations, holidays, and other reasons. Overtime hours\nneeded as a result of lost hours sometimes are indicated to highlight\nextra costs that result from absenteeism.\n-\nRevenue and expense summary report--Includes cost per\nscheduled miles, income per scheduled miles, and cost per passenger.\nUse of Monitoring to Reduce Costs\nRecovering Accident Damages\nBecause of its bar code system that tracks labor and parts,\nVIA's MIS is programmed to generate invoices that are used to\nrecover accident damages when the VIA driver was not at fault. The\ndetailed invoice shows the amount of hours worked along with an\nindividual parts listing for each repair. A similar invoice can be\ngenerated for vandalism damage. VIA Risk Management is tasked\nwith collecting the damages. A precise documentation of the costs\nmakes it easier to recover damages.\nCost Data Drive Equipment\nSpecifications\nMCTS uses data on unit failure rates and rebuild costs to make\nkey decisions concerning equipment specifications for new bus\norders. If data indicate that one particular component design is more\ncost-effective than another, MCTS will specify that design in its next\nbus order. These data also allow the agency to determine how units\nwill be rebuilt in the future and by whom. For example, if data\nindicate that it is more cost-effective to outsource a particular\ncomponent, MCTS will investigate, review costs carefully, and\npossibly outsource the rebuilding or repair of that component.\nAs another example, CENTRO specified electrical training as\npart of its upcoming bus procurement after data obtained from its\nmonitoring program showed high costs associated with electrical\nrepairs.\nParts Control\nThe electronic monitoring systems used by UPS and VIA are\ntied to a central inventory system for spare parts. Once a part is taken\nfrom stock and used in a repair, inventory levels are adjusted\nautomatically. In addition to identifying excessive use of parts by\nindividual employees, the monitoring systems ensure adequate\ninventory levels without the extra costs associated with excessive\nparts stockpiling.\nTo reduce the wasted time and costs associated with finding\ncorrect parts for a repair, VIA reassigns each OEM part number. By\narranging digits in a certain manner, the agency's unique \"smart part\nnumber\" identifies the specific bus and subassembly on which the\npart fits. This allows mechanics to repair buses, not search for correct\npart numbers.\nIn a related cost-saving move, VIA also requires that each part\nremoved from a bus be placed in specially marked containers\nthroughout the facility. The discarded parts are then inspected to\ndetermine whether they should be rebuilt, recycled, or scrapped.\nVehicle Life-Cycle Costs\nAlthough transit agencies are told how long to keep buses,\nbased on FTA guidelines, UPS uses life-cycle cost data to make\ndecisions concerning vehicle replacement. The company's previous\npolicy was to keep vehicles for as long as possible. UPS now uses\ncost data to determine optimum replacement cycles, by continuously\nmonitoring vehicle age, depreciation, vehicle costs, and maintenance\ncosts through its MIS. By doing so, UPS also considers the vehicle's\nduty cycle and operating environment. The replacement cycle also\ntakes into consideration the fuel economy and emissions benefits\noffered by electronically controlled engines found in today's trucks.\nBased on all factors, the company has adopted a 10- to 12-year cycle\nas a guide for tractor replacements and a 15-year cycle as a guide for\ndelivery vans. Regardless of the cycle, no vehicle can be retired\nwithout permission from the UPS corporate office.\n\nCHAPTER FIVE\nCONCLUSIONS\nFindings\nAfter surveying five transit agencies and one private trucking\ncompany, the findings can be summarized by a single phrase often\nrepeated by the maintenance director at the Milwaukee County\nTransit System (MCTS) during the on-site interview: \"What gets\nmeasured gets done.\" Although organized differently, each agency\nmeasures maintenance performance to gain improvements. In\naddition, each agency recognizes the importance of communicating\nmaintenance performance monitoring results directly to the work\nforce. Monitoring maintenance performance for the enlightenment of\nmanagement alone is an incomplete exercise. Informing employees\nof their productivity lets them know that management is aware of\ntheir actions and can detect both increases and decreases in\nperformance levels.\nOverall findings are as follows:\n-\nOriginal equipment manufacturer (OEM) service manuals\nand flat-rate manuals provide a starting point for transit agencies to\ndevelop in-house job procedures and time standards. Written\nstandards and rules clearly indicate what is expected from employees\nand how their performance will be measured.\n-\nThe work order is the backbone of an agency's\nmaintenance performance monitoring program. Information on work\norders is reviewed manually or entered in a computerized\nmanagement information system (MIS) to organize data and format\nreports.\n-\nAlthough Federal Transit Administration (FTA) National\nTransit Database (NTD) reports indicate an agency's overall\nmaintenance performance, they do not allow specific aspects of\nmaintenance performance to be compared in a consistent manner.\nSome agencies report data in one manner to FTA and use other\nprocedures and definitions for their internal monitoring programs.\n-\nAlthough agencies perform similar maintenance tasks,\neach uses different approaches to monitor the performance of these\ntasks.\n-\nRegardless of the approach used, management uses\nmaintenance performance monitoring programs to assess its own\neffectiveness and improve its maintenance operation. Specific actions\ntaken as a result of monitoring follow:\n-\nTraining to improve employees' troubleshooting\nskills and reduce unnecessary consumption of\nreplacement parts;\n-\nDetermining employee promotions and incentive\nawards;\n-\nModifying bus specifications to improve equipment\nreliability;\n-\nEnhance preventive maintenance (PM) programs to\nreduce repeat failures, road calls, and unscheduled\nmaintenance;\n-\nSchedule maintenance activities, allocate personnel,\nand increase employees' productive time;\n-\nImprove employee and customer satisfaction; and\n-\nReduce costs.\n-\nThe lack of commonly accepted definitions and\nprocedures makes it difficult to compare the performance of one\nagency with that of another.\n-\nThe lack of industry uniformity also makes it difficult for\nagencies to determine whether their monitoring approaches are\neffective.\nManagement Philosophy\n-\nManagement's willingness to assess its own performance\nestablishes a fitting example in which to monitor all aspects of the\nmaintenance organization.\n-\nEach agency surveyed has its own level of management\noversight, making it clear what is expected of employees in advance.\nThe oversight is balanced by giving employees some degree of\nresponsibility and participation in problem solving to create an\natmosphere of mutual respect.\n-\nRegardless of the level of management oversight,\nmanagement must establish strong lines of communication with\nemployees. The communication not only allows management to\nassess employee productivity, but also allows management to obtain\nvaluable firsthand feedback concerning equipment performance.\n-\nThe agencies surveyed are split on the use of specialized\nand nonspecialized work forces, each having justifications for their\napproaches.\n-\nOf the agencies with incentive programs surveyed, the\nmajority reward employees for exceptional safety performance and\nlow absenteeism. Concerning discipline, agencies focus on bringing\npoor performance results to an individual's attention to help improve\nwork quality and performance levels.\nEmployee Productivity\n-\nMost of the agencies use job procedures and time\nstandards to measure employee productivity. The level of detail\ndepends on the resources available. Larger agencies tend to have\nmore detailed standards against which to measure performance.\n-\nEvery agency has the ability to monitor an employee's\ntime by using the work order. However, agencies with sophisticated\nelectronic capabilities can generate reports that itemize\n\nan employee's time in a variety of categories. The information is used\nto identify excessive use of time and training needs and to hold\nemployees accountable for their productivity.\n-\nAgencies use repeat failures as the primary method of\ntracking faulty workmanship or inherent product design problems.\nThe ability to track such faults depends on the sophistication of\nmonitoring and the agency's oversight abilities. Agencies that assign\nvehicles to specific employees find it easier to identify faulty\nworkmanship.\n-\nDetecting\nwhether\nemployees\nare\ntroubleshooting\nproblems correctly or simply changing parts is difficult for many\nagencies. Those effective at it have the ability to monitor diagnostic\ntime and parts usage by individual mechanics.\n-\nBudget reductions are placing a strain on many in-house\ntraining programs. Agencies with limited funding rely on OEM\ntraining programs and encourage employees to use outside training.\nScreening tests are used by many agencies to test job applicants'\nmechanical aptitude and ability prior to hiring. Most agencies use\nhistorical performance data to target training to specific trouble areas.\nEquipment Performance\n-\nMany agencies place the responsibility for ensuring that\nthe appropriate number of buses are available to meet peak pullouts\nwith the maintenance department.\n-\nAgencies have independent definitions for road calls and\nservice interruptions. Despite these differences, each monitors the\nfrequency of road calls in a consistent manner because such\nmonitoring indicates the agency's overall performance.\n-\nAlong with the frequency of road calls, adherence to PM\ninspection intervals is a primary indicator of equipment performance.\nFrequencies are based on OEM recommendations, adjusted to suit\neach agency's needs.\n-\nAlthough scheduled maintenance is impossible to\neliminate, its frequency can be controlled to ensure an orderly work\nschedule. Most agencies monitor the ratio of scheduled to\nunscheduled maintenance to indicate improvements in vehicle\nreliability\n-\nRestricted by procurement requirements, some of the\nagencies have standard equipment to simplify monitoring and other\naspects of maintenance.\n-\nAgencies use a variety of techniques to help drivers\naccurately report and describe vehicle faults.\n-\nPassenger surveys are used by all agencies to determine\nwhether customers are pleased with the mechanical condition of\nvehicles. One agency requires managers to ride buses on a monthly\nbasis to rate service.\nControlling Costs\n-\nThe ability to produce and format maintenance\nperformance monitoring reports into useful documents depends on\nthe resources of the agency. Although some are able to produce\nextremely detailed reports showing costs in a variety of ways, others\nare not.\n-\nIn all cases, agencies use cost reports to target areas that\nneed improvement.\n-\nThese reports also are used to determine whether actions\ntaken to reduce costs have been successful.\nConclusions\nDespite the ingenuity shown by many agencies in developing\ntheir individual maintenance performance monitoring programs, the\ntransit industry clearly lacks guidance and direction in this important\narea. NTD reports, useful as a basic assessment of overall agency\nperformance, are not being used widely by maintenance personnel.\nOther conclusions are as follows:\n-\nTransit agencies require a method to determine whether\nin-house monitoring programs are effective.\n-\nAgencies also require some level of standardization\nconcerning definitions and data collection for essential performance\nmeasures. The need to develop a universally accepted definition of\nroad call is long overdue. Standard terminology and procedures\nwould allow agencies to compare key performance indicators in a\nsimilar manner.\n-\nBecause smaller agencies lack resources, they tend to\nneed more assistance in establishing maintenance performance\nmonitoring programs.\nRecommendations\n1.\nEstablish a liaison group consisting of representatives from\ntransit maintenance and FTA to determine a maintenance\nperformance monitoring approach that would serve the needs of\nboth parties.\n2.\nDevelop a set of industry-accepted guidelines to help agencies\ndevelop maintenance performance monitoring programs. The\nguidelines should include standard definitions and procedures\nfor measuring key performance indicators such as the\nfollowing:\n- Road calls\n- Unscheduled maintenance\n- Cost-per-mile calculations\n- Adherence to PM intervals\n- Customer satisfaction.\n3.\nConduct a detailed study to determine which approaches to\nmaintenance performance monitoring are the most effective.\n4.\nIdentify efficient maintenance practices agencies can use to\nmaximize bus availability during peak periods to reduce\nvehicle/spare ratios.\n5.\nEstablish a series of basic tests agencies can use to verify the\neffectiveness of their in-house maintenance performance\nmonitoring programs. Consider creating peer groups to conduct\nobjective evaluations of an agency's monitoring program.\n\nREFERENCES\n1.\nMaintenance Manual. 731 Falcon Retrofit, Dassault Aviation.\n6.\nDolce, John.

The U.S.\nautomotive operation maintains more than 76,000 motor vehicles,\nnearly 56,000 trailers, and more than 17,000 pieces of airport-based\nsupport equipment. All U.S.-based delivery vehicles are controlled\nby one set of maintenance and repair policies. This allows UPS to\nmonitor its entire fleet nationally and compare the performance of\nindividual maintenance locations with a particular region or with the\nentire operation.\nMANAGEMENT PHILOSOPHY\nCorporate Structure\nThe UPS corporate headquarters is located in Atlanta, Georgia.\nUPS engineers and specialists provide national support, and the\ncompany's environmental specialists strive to stay ahead of\nimpending federal regulations.\nRegional Structure\nUPS is divided into regions and districts, each with\nmaintenance management personnel. Regional automotive managers\nFLEET PROFILE\ncommunicate among several districts and corporate headquarters.\nDistrict automotive managers are responsible for all automotive\nactivities within a specified district. Supervisors, who report to fleet\nmanagers, work directly with mechanics to oversee their work. On\naverage, a fleet manager is responsible for 30 mechanics, whereas a\nsupervisor is responsible for eight.\nNonspecialized Work Force\nExcept for body repairs, each mechanic is expected to perform\nall maintenance activities. Mechanics and drivers are assigned\nspecific vehicles, allowing UPS to trace vehicle abuse and repeat\nfailures. The company believes that this practice instills pride of\nownership, inspiring employees to have greater respect for their\nwork.\nWages and Benefits\nUPS runs a unionized shop; raises and benefits are negotiated.\nThe UPS profit-sharing program allows hourly employees to buy\nshares in the company. Mechanics earn about $20 per hour plus\nbenefits.\nEmpowerment Philosophy\nInstead of micromanaging, UPS gives employees more\ndecision-making power. The company subscribes to the management\nCompany\nUnited Parcel Service (UPS)\nLocation\nStratford, Connecticut\nService Area\nN/A\nAnnual Miles\n1,932,000\nAnnual Ridership\nN/A\nNumber and Type of Facilities\nAlthough UPS operates a fleet of vehicles internationally, this profile\npertains to its Stratford facility only.\nDays of Operation/Shifts\nMonday-Friday: 3 shifts\nSaturday: 2 shifts\nNumber of Vehicles\n56 Diesel Tractors\n101 Delivery Vans\n1 Service Truck\nMaintenance Staff\nOffice:\n1 Part-Time Clerk\n1 Fleet Manager (with responsibility for four additional locations)\nShop:\n2 Supervisors\n14 Mechanics/Servicers\nTotal: 18\n\nphilosophy outlined by Scott B. Parry in his book, From Managing\nto Empowering, An Action Guide to Developing Winning Facilitation\nSkills (10). Although not mandatory, UPS strongly encourages\nmanagers to read this book, which shows them how to cultivate a\nnew mind set, change traditional corporate culture, and empower\nemployees so that they can perform their jobs more effectively. By\nempowering its employees, UPS has reduced the number of\nmaintenance supervisors. Absenteeism and turnover also have been\nreduced.\nIncentives\nUPS nationwide incentive programs include a Mechanic Safe\nWork Program, Group Safety Award, and Road Call Recognition\nProgram. Employees can choose from gifts and cash awards. Each\nUPS facility can offer its own incentives.\nEmployee Relations and Communication\nUPS management is committed to fostering an environment in\nwhich mechanics can contribute freely to improving efficiency.\nSupervisors are trained to make the transition from parent-child to\nadult-adult relationships in the workplace. A biannual survey obtains\nfeedback from employees on several work-related issues, including\nworking conditions, management oversight, and safety. If a particular\nissue is too sensitive (e.g., sexual harassment or discrimination),\nemployees can use an 800 number to contact corporate headquarters.\nAn employee relations index measures job satisfaction.\nEMPLOYEE PRODUCTIVITY\nWork Procedures and Time Standards\nEach repair and inspection activity has a step-by-step written\nprocedure associated with it. Preventive maintenance\n(PM) inspections include a checklist so that a mechanic can pick up\nwhere another left off.\nWritten procedures include troubleshooting steps, required\ntools, disposal of hazardous materials, and required safety-related\nequipment and procedures. Except for PM inspections, adherence to\nwork procedures is not mandatory. However, these procedures are\nused as a starting point for correcting faulty workmanship and\nexcessive use of time.\nTime is allotted for each segment of a repair. Although\nmechanics prioritize their work, the total hours they work on each\nsegment must fall within the time allotted for it.\nAutomotive Information System\n(AIS) Monitors Time\nUPS uses Automotive Information System (AIS), a proprietary\nsystem that tracks employee productivity and records consumables\nused by mechanics, including parts and fluids. At\nthe heart of the system is a hand-held device called a personal digital\nassistant (PDA), which mechanics use to record all daily activities.\nThe PDA stores data until the end of the day, when it is downloaded\ninto AIS. AIS allows mechanics to follow their self-directed work\nschedules and take pride in meeting them. AIS also allows UPS to\nhave a permanent vehicle history record to satisfy U.S. Department\nof Transportation (DOT) requirements.\nPrioritizing and Scheduling Work\nUPS mechanics are given the authority to prioritize tasks,\nthrough a system of priority codes. PM inspections are assigned a\npriority code based on the time remaining to the next scheduled\nservice. PM intervals are based on vehicle operating conditions and\npast performance. Needed repairs are assigned priority codes by the\nmechanic or supervisor, depending on the severity of the problem. A\ncomputer-generated report is given to each mechanic daily, listing a\npriority code for each vehicle based on the following system:\n-\nNo. 9--Repair/maintenance is overdue\n-\nNo. 7--Repair/maintenance should be done now\n-\nNo. 5--Repair/maintenance is coming due soon.\nMechanics meet with their supervisors on Fridays to schedule\nwork for the following week. The goal at UPS is to have mechanics\npredict failures and schedule maintenance to prevent them. Assisting\nthem is a communication network consisting of e-mail messages and\nreports issued by the corporate office. The reports communicate\nspecific solutions to mechanical problems and information on failure\ntrends.\nTraining and Professional Development\nUPS hires skilled journeyman mechanics, who must complete a\nmandatory 22-day training program on company-specific work\nmethods and procedures. Highly skilled maintenance personnel\nbecome regional training instructors, who conduct update training on\nnew technology. Maintenance personnel also spend time with new\ndrivers reviewing technical material.\nIn terms of management training, UPS believes in \"growing\"\ntheir mechanics to work up through the ranks. A career planning\nguide is reviewed annually to establish professional career paths.\nManagers attend UPS-run management training schools.\nEQUIPMENT PERFORMANCE\nStandardization\nInstead of issuing detailed hardware specifications, UPS tries to\nprocure \"off-the-shelf\" vehicles and components. One manager\nadmitted, \"our business is delivering packages, not building\nvehicles.\" Standardization has resulted in lower vehicle prices and\nimproved parts availability.\n\n__________________________________________\nOnce a vehicle contract is issued, pilot inspections are held at\nthe manufacturing facility so that drivers, mechanics, and supervisors\nbecome familiar with the build process. Before procuring large\nnumbers of vehicles, UPS orders a small fleet for test and evaluation\npurposes. UPS performs its own warranty work.\nNeed-Based Maintenance\nExcept for PM inspections, UPS does not establish blanket time\nand mileage intervals for maintenance because such policies are too\ncostly Vehicles are not fueled or washed daily unless required.\nEngine overhauls are done on an as-needed basis.\nAny repair that exceeds $2000 requires authorization from the\nregional manager, who considers the vehicle's age, mileage, and\noverall condition before deciding to make the repair. Most repairs are\ndone in-house.\nMonitoring Road Calls\nThe UPS definition of a road call is straightforward: any\nactivity performed to help a driver who needs mechanical assistance\nto continue service. Road calls are tracked by \"car day\" (one service\nday per vehicle). UPS averages one road call per 300 car days. Its\ngoal is one road call for every 500 car days of service.\nRoad calls are categorized in several ways, including\nbreakdown by driver, fault, vehicle, and mechanic. Road call reports\nare used to identify failure trends.\nMonitoring PM Intervals\nAIS prints a PMI (Preventive Maintenance Inspection)\nSchedule & Non-Compliance report for each mechanic's fleet.\nVehicles are listed in priority order, beginning with vehicles whose\nPM is overdue. (According to UPS, vehicles rarely exceed scheduled\nintervals by more than 1 percent). Supervisors use this report to\ndetermine whether mechanics are adhering to PM inspection\nschedules.\nDriver Participation\nUPS encourages drivers to communicate with mechanics. The\ncompany is now experimenting with program in which drivers grade\nhow well the vehicle was serviced, similar to the response cards used\nby automobile dealers. The intent of the program is to view the driver\nas an internal customer to the shop.\nVehicle Life\nUPS, which used to keep vehicles for as long as possible, now\nuses a 10- to 12-year cycle as a guide for tractor replacement and a\n15-year cycle for delivery vans. UPS continuously monitors a\nvehicle's age, depreciation, and maintenance costs to determine an\noptimum replacement cycle. The\ncompany considers duty cycle, operating environment, fuel economy\nand emission benefits that new vehicles offer. No vehicle can be\nretired without corporate permission.\nCONTROLLING COSTS\nUPS continually monitors adherence to budgets and seeks ways\nto reduce costs. The company believes in \"growing cost-efficiency\nfrom the bottom up,\" encouraging all employees to reduce costs.\nCosts are classified by vehicle, road call, type of repair, parts,\naccidents, fuel, tires, and direct versus indirect labor. The bottom line\nat UPS is to tie maintenance costs directly to its core business-\ndelivering packages. The company's goal is to reduce costs by 10\npercent.\nVIA METROPOLITAN TRANSIT\nBACKGROUND\nVIA Metropolitan Transit (VIA) operates 678 revenue vehicles\nin San Antonio, Texas, the 10th largest city in the United States. The\nagency has switched from a manual maintenance performance\nmonitoring system to an automated one. The majority of VIA's bus\nfleet consists of General Motors RTS-style buses, all powered by\nDetroit\nDiesel\nCorporation\n71-Series\nengines.\nEquipment\nstandardization has played a key role in allowing VIA to monitor its\nmaintenance performance. A bar coding system is used to monitor\nemployee productivity and parts usage. Despite the automated\nequipment, management believes that a strong \"talking\" relationship\nwith mechanics provides valuable information that computers cannot.\nFLEET PROFILE\nAgency\nVIA Metropolitan Transit\nLocation\nSan Antonio, Texas\nService Area\n1,232 mi2 (3,191 km2)\nAnnual Miles\n20,926,512\nAnnual Ridership\n34,152,270\nNumber and Type of Facilities\nOne central maintenance facility\nDays of Operation/Shifts\nMonday--Sunday: 5 shifts\nNumber of Vehicles\n522 Buses\n156 Paratransit Vehicles\n82 Support Vehicles\nMaintenance Staff\nOffice:\n1 Director\n1 Admin. Asst\nI Secretary\n1 Warranty Clerk\nShop/Garage:\n2 Managers\n12 Foremen (all shifts)\n158 Skilled Employees\n96 Unskilled Employees\nTotal:\n\nMANAGEMENT PHILOSOPHY\nVIA believes that obtaining exceptional performance from\nemployees requires constant dedication from management. The\nagency strives to create an atmosphere that is conducive to\nmaintenance productivity. Even though each manager has an area of\nexpertise based on his or her background and interests, when a\nproblem arises, all managers pitch in to solve it. Managers meet on a\nregular basis to establish goals for reducing costs. Adherence to\nmanagement goals is monitored by the agency's management\ninformation system (MIS) and reviewed at periodic meetings.\nOversight\nVIA management's approach to oversight and control can be\nsummarized as follows: monitor performance carefully, give senior\nemployees the necessary freedom to complete jobs efficiently, and\ncommunicate with employees and encourage their participation to\nhelp solve problems.\nComputer Monitoring System\nVIA\nchanged\nfrom\nmanual\nmaintenance\nperformance\nmonitoring to a fully automated system in August 1995. The manual\nsystem provided a solid foundation for the automated one. After a\nsmall-scale demonstration was held, MIS personnel spent 3 months\nlearning maintenance routines and understanding managers' needs.\nVIA's maintenance department determined in advance how to\nformat the reports. The agency discovered that maintenance reports\nare better in graphic form. Mechanics prefer easy-to-view charts that\nshow improvements and reductions in maintenance performance.\nReports must be cumulative (i.e., monthly reports are accumulated\ninto an annual report) to identify trends. The computerized system\nuses bar codes to monitor employee productivity. (A complete\nexplanation of how VIA's bar coding system monitors time appears\nlater in this case study).\nFreedom for Senior Workers\nVIA recognizes that senior maintenance employees need a\ncertain amount of freedom to be productive. Although the agency has\ndetailed job procedures, they are used primarily by novice mechanics\nas training aids. If faulty workmanship is found through repeat\nfailure monitoring, however, work procedures are used as a basis to\nredirect the efforts of all employees.\nCommunication Encouraged\nVIA encourages managers to gather information by establishing open\nlines of communication with mechanics. This\ncreates an atmosphere of mutual respect. Each employee meets with\nmanagement periodically to review year-to-date attendance records,\nparts usage, and how each minute of the workday was spent during\nthe previous week. Managers do not criticize employees at these\nmeetings. Instead they want to ensure employees that management is\ninterested in their activities and that maintenance employees\nunderstand the financial impact of their actions. In addition to the\nmeetings, three performance results are posted monthly: AM and PM\nbuses not available for service, daily preventive maintenance (PM)\ninspections performed, and lost time versus overtime hours worked.\nNonspecialized Work Force\nVIA mechanics are expected to perform a wide variety of tasks,\nranging from routine inspections to rebuilding engines and\ntransmissions. Mechanics rotate into other areas on a regular basis to\nkeep their skills fresh. This allows management to place many\nemployees in a particular area (e.g., engines or brakes) when needed\nto address peaks in the repair cycle.\nIncentives\nVIA has no formal incentive programs. The agency believes\nthat maintenance personnel take pride in their work and uses\nperformance results to show employees how they contribute to the\nagency's prosperity.\nEMPLOYEE PRODUCTIVITY\nWritten Work Procedures\nWritten work procedures are arranged in four booklets: main air\nsystem, electrical and charging, drivetrain and components, and\nsteering and suspension (5). Each procedure consists of diagrams\nshowing all related components, troubleshooting and test procedures,\nand removal and reinstallation instructions. Booklets are intended to\nbe used as a training guide for entry-level mechanics. Senior\nmechanics are not required to follow procedures exactly as written.\nBar Coding System Monitors\nBoth Time and Parts\nVIA first experimented with bar coding more than 10 years ago\nto streamline spare parts purchasing and inventory operation. The\nagency began using bar codes on a limited basis in the maintenance\ndepartment in August 1995, using payroll timecards with a small\ngroup of employees. Once optimized, bar coding was applied to the\nmainstream of the maintenance operation.\n\nA series of bar codes affixed to an employee's payroll timecard,\nparts requisition form, and job codes ties all repair activity to the\nwork order. The bar code system tracks time and parts usage for each\naspect of the repair. This allows VIA to establish average times for\nspecific repair tasks and to identify employees who use excessive\namounts of time and parts to complete repairs. The system also is\nused to automatically adjust parts inventories.\nThe bar coding system works as follows:\n1.\nWhen a defect is reported to maintenance, a garage clerk\nwrites the vehicle's identification number and defect\ndescription on a work order.\n2.\nA unique bar coded label is attached to the work order,\nwhich creates a \"job\" in VIA's maintenance tracking\nsystem.\n3.\nA garage clerk manually enters the vehicle number and\nreported defect into the system. This ties the vehicle's\nmaintenance history to the opened job. Information\navailable to employees includes a complete description of\nthe bus and its repair history.\n4.\nOnce a job is opened, the work order is assigned to a\nmechanic, who takes it to one of many centrally located\ntime clocks (Figure 4). The mechanic clocks onto the job\nby scanning the bar code located on his or her payroll\ntimecard, along with the bar code on the work order.\n5.\nAfter clocking onto the job, the mechanic selects the\nappropriate repair description (e.g., charging system\ndiagnostics) from a book of descriptions located next to\nthe time clock. Adjacent to each description is a\ncorresponding bar code, which the mechanic scans.\n6.\nAll information, including the mechanic's identification\nnumber, starting time, and type of repair are logged into\nVIA's tracking system and tied to a specific work order.\nThe mechanic also writes a brief description of his or her\nwork on the work order, which is entered into the system\nmanually by a clerk when the job is completed.\n7.\nWhen parts are needed to complete a repair, the mechanic\nwrites the required information on a parts requisition\nform, which must be approved by the foreman. The\nmechanic then scans the bar code label on his or her\npayroll timecard, the work order, and the requisition form.\nThe tracking system automatically ties the mechanic and\nscanned requisition form to the job and alerts storeroom\npersonnel of the forthcoming parts request.\nIn most cases, the requisition is delivered to the storeroom\nthrough an air-tube system or, occasionally, by the mechanic.\nStoreroom personnel use a hand-held scanner to scan the labels of the\npart to be delivered and the requisition form. This allows the tracking\nsystem to tie a specific part to the job, adjusting inventory levels\naccordingly. The storeroom then delivers the part to the mechanic.\n8.\nAs repair work progresses, mechanics continue to make\nbar coded and written entries onto the work order. Each\ntime a new activity takes place, the mechanic scans the\nappropriate repair codes, which logs the type of work\nbeing done and the appropriate start and stop time. This\ncontinues until all required repairs are finished.\n9.\nWhen the repairs are completed, the mechanic scans off\nthe job and hands the work order to the foreman, who\nreviews the work. The garage clerk then closes the job by\nscanning the bar coded label on the work order. The clerk\nalso types in any handwritten information that the\nstandardized list of repair codes did not adequately\ndescribe. All information entered into the maintenance\ntracking system becomes part of the vehicle's permanent\nfile.\nParts Control\nIn addition to adjusting inventory levels, the VIA bar coding\nsystem tracks parts usage to determine whether mechanics are\ndiagnosing faults properly. The MIS generates a report that shows all\nparts used by an individual mechanic during the past month. To\nreduce the time needed to find the correct part, VIA reassigns each\noriginal equipment manufacturer (OEM) part number with its own\n\"smart part number.\" This allows mechanics to spend time repairing\nbuses, not searching for part numbers.\nVIA requires that every part removed from a bus be placed in\nspecially marked containers throughout the facility. Discarded parts\nare inspected to determine whether they can be rebuilt or recycled or\nwhether they should be scrapped.\nUsing Time Monitoring to Improve\nProductivity\nBar coding allows management to review the amount of time\neach mechanic spends on specific repair activities Instead of\ncomparing one mechanic's time with that of another, VIA only\ncompares an individual's time with his or her past performance.\nBecause the agency rotates employees into different jobs, VIA\nunderstands that individuals may be proficient in certain areas and\nnot so skillful in others. It is the performance an employee displays\nin all technical areas that is of real importance to the agency.\nVIA has not yet established time standards for specific jobs.\nHowever, it is currently considering the use of formal time standards\nin the future. If the time a mechanic takes to complete a given task\nincreases, management brings it to the individual's attention and\nattempts to determine the reasons. Because troubleshooting time is\nentered separately into the bar coded system, a weakness in this area\nis easily identified and corrected through additional training.\nTraining\nVIA trains unskilled employees who have both the desire and\naptitude to learn mechanical skills. The agency selected 10 of its\nhighly talented mechanics with an interest in training\n\nand hired a contractor to instruct them on how to teach. Instructors\nwere divided into two groups and given the task of writing VIA's\nfour job procedure booklets. The procedures in these booklets are\nused as guides to instruct entry-level mechanics and to test their\nabilities. A separate training record booklet records the results of\neach battery of tests. VIA uses historical data on repeat failures,\nservice interruptions, and unscheduled maintenance to identify\ntraining needs.\nFacility Layout\nVIA's central maintenance facility, which was designed more\nthan 46 years ago, helps maximize employee productivity (Figure 5).\nThe facility is organized into five primary areas: (1)\ndrivetrain\n(engine and transmission overhaul), (2)inspection, (3) brakes and air\nconditioning, (4) body and paint, and (5) electronics.\nEach area is assigned a foreman and includes work bays.\nBehind the work bays is the equipment needed to support the\nparticular activity (e.g., lathes and other support equipment needed\nfor brake relining).\nDuring peak periods when buses are on the road, mechanics\nwork in the support area rebuilding or refurbishing units. During off-\npeak periods, they move to the adjacent work bays to install these\nunits on buses or perform inspections.\nFew solid structures protrude above 4 ft from the floor,\nallowing management to observe employees.\nProductivity Reports\nVIA's lost time versus overtime hours worked bar chart shows\nthe total number of hours lost each day due to illness and\noccupational, personal, and other reasons. The number of daily\novertime hours needed as a result are plotted on this chart.\nThe vehicle maintenance employee labor/parts tracker is a\nseries of graphic reports that illustrate how each mechanic has used\ntime throughout each day of a month, including time spent on\ndiagnosing problems, retrieving spare parts, and completing the\nrepair. One report shows the amount of parts used by each mechanic\nduring any given month. VIA reports also include percentage of\nvehicle maintenance productive labor hours and revenue miles per\nemployee.\nSEQUIPMENT PERFORMANCE\nStandardization\nEquipment standardization at VIA has played a key role in\nsimplifying maintenance performance monitoring. Most buses are\nGeneral Motors RTS advanced design buses with Detroit Diesel\nCorporation 71-Series engines.\nWhen a solution is found to a particular problem, the solution is\nimplemented on every bus during a fleetwide campaign. This allows\nVIA to standardize its parts and job procedures.\nReal-Time Status of Bus Availability\nAll VIA buses are stored and serviced from a central facility\nand each is assigned and numbered outdoor parking spaces. Buses\nreturning from service are entered into the MIS in one of two\ncategories: those in need of scheduled service or repair and those that\ncan go back into service after receiving fuel and routine daily\nservicing. This allows both operations and maintenance to track the\nreal-time status of a vehicle's availability.\nReports Monitor Specific Aspects of Equipment\nPerformance\nPM inspections are performed on all VIA buses. Once a\ndetailed PM program is established and followed on a regular basis,\nVIA believes that \"the rest will take care of itself.\" The agency uses a\n5,500-mi PM interval, which means that 11 buses per day must be\ninspected. Once a requirement for daily PM inspections was\nestablished, the agency realized that it needed a fourth shift to\nperform the inspections in a timely manner. A graphic report, issued\nmonthly, is used to show whether the goal of 11 PM inspections per\nday is being met (Figure 7).\nBecause of the warm climate, VIA has a detailed PM inspection\nprogram for air conditioning (A/C) maintenance. The program,\nwhich begins in October each year, starts with the newest buses in\nthe fleet and ends with the oldest. Experience has shown that the\nolder buses need more attention. Consequently, starting with newer\nbuses ensures that they will be fully operational when the A/C season\napproaches. This allows the agency to spend time on the older buses\nduring the summer months to keep them fully operational. A report,\nwhich lists every bus in the fleet, indicates when A/C inspections\nwere last performed.\nBecause of its ability to accurately track labor and parts, VIA\ncan generate invoices to recover accident damages when the bus\ndriver was not at fault. The detailed invoice shows the amount of\nhours worked, along with an individual parts listing for each repair.\nA similar invoice can be generated for vandalism damage. VIA Risk\nManagement is tasked with collecting the damages. Providing\nprecise documentation makes it easier to recover costs.\nOther equipment-related reports include a bus change report\n(service interruptions); miles between air conditioning failures; bus\nmiles per brake relining; bus operations report of bus availability;\nand customer complaint activity based on survey results.\nCONTROLLING COSTS\nA monthly vehicle report cost analysis shows the total cost for\nlabor and parts for each bus type. Labor costs are divided into 42\nareas (e.g., engine repair, brakes, and paint); part costs are broken\ndown into 17 categories. The report relates\n\n___________________________________________\nthe total maintenance cost per vehicle type to its seating capacity.\nAdditional cost data are provided as follows:\n-\nPercentage of total costs (year to date) to total fleet costs;\n-\nPercentage of total costs (previous month) to total fleet\ncosts; and\n-\nPercentage of total miles (year to date) to total fleet miles.\nA summary at the end of the vehicle report cost analysis report\nreflects specific costs for each bus type, including the total repair\ncost, costs per mile and per seat, percentage of total fleet costs, and\npercentage of total fleet miles traveled.\nFuture Maintenance Performance\nMonitoring Plans\nVIA wants its maintenance performance monitoring system to\ngenerate exception reports quickly, while activities are still fresh on\nemployees' minds. The agency plans to monitor each rebuild part\nfrom the initial purchase date through the date of installation, until\nthe part is scrapped. A procedure will compare the cost and quality of\noutside rebuild sources with VIA's own in-house operation.\nMILWAUKEE COUNTY TRANSIT SYSTEM\nBACKGROUND\nMilwaukee Transport Services, Inc. (MTS), is a private\ncompany under contract to manage the Milwaukee County Transit\nSystem (MCTS). MTS manages MCTS as a quasi-private\nbusiness/public agency. As a result of budget reductions, a slight\ndecrease in ridership, and a decrease in AM peak bus operations, the\nmaintenance department has downsized in recent years.\nBecause of its large fleet, which comprises 526 buses, MCTS\nrequires that several bus components be rebuilt on a continuous\nbasis. To determine the most cost-effective approach to rebuilding,\nthe agency has developed a detailed monitoring system. The system\nallows MCTS to compare the life-cycle costs of components rebuilt\nby outside vendors with the costs of components rebuilt by its own\nshop. In doing so, the agency's own in-house rebuilding shop\ncompetes with private vendors for business. This case study will\nhighlight MCTS's unit rebuild and monitoring operation.\nFLEET PROFILE\nAgency\nMilwaukee County Transit System\nLocation\nMilwaukee, Wisconsin\nService Area\n237 mi2 (614 km2)\nAnnual Miles\n20,519,692\nAnnual Ridership\n48,936,683\nNumber and Type of Facilities\nFour: One central repair and three\nSatellite garages\nDays of Operation/Shifts\nMan Shop:\nMonday--Friday: 1 shift\nGarages:\nMonday--Sunday--24 hours\nNumber of Vehicles\n526 Buses\n34 Support Vehicles\nMaintenance Staff\nOffice:\n13, including maintenance\ndirector and engineering,\nquality control, training,\nand support staff\nMain Shop:\n1 Manager\n6 Supervisors\n95 Mechanics, etc\nGarages:\n3 Managers\n13 Shift Supervisors\n6 Clerks\n6 Dispatchers\n98 Mechanics\n37 Service Line Employees\n3 Janitors\nTotal:\nMANAGEMENT PHILOSOPHY\nMCTS takes pride in running its maintenance department like a\nprivate enterprise and uses performance monitoring to be more cost-\neffective. Each year five to seven goals are established for managers\nand merit increases are tied to achieving these goals. The agency's\nconsistent approach to collecting data allows it to benchmark the\nperformance of each garage, comparing performance with that of\nother garages.\nMeasurement Causes Improvement\nMCTS has conducted time and motion studies for many tasks,\ndocumenting the most efficient method of performing these tasks\nwithin a given time frame. Believing that \"measurement causes\nimprovement,\" the agency monitors time and expects employees to\nachieve established levels of productivity. This allows management\nto track an employee's performance on the same task over time, to\ncompare the productivity of one employee with that of another, and\nto establish production schedules and staffing levels for each garage.\nSpecialized Work Force\nMCTS mechanics are placed where they feel most comfortable\n(as opposed to having them perform a variety of tasks and\n\nfail at those in which they have little interest or skill). The agency\nbelieves that a specialized work force is more capable of predicting\nfailures because of employees' constant exposure to specific\nmechanical areas.\nIncentives\nA Union contract limits incentive programs at MCTS.\nEmployees are recognized for perfect attendance, suggestions that\nresult in cost savings, and safety performance. On occasion,\nmaintenance employees are treated to pizza in subzero weather and\nsoft drinks during hot summer months.\nCommunication\nAn in-house publication, Maintenance News, keeps MCTS\nemployees informed on a variety of issues ranging from bus\nmaintenance and technology to employee productivity. Some\nperformance measures are posted on a bulletin board.\nEMPLOYEE PRODUCTIVITY\nTime and Work Standards\nThe industrial engineer on staff has conducted time and motion\nstudies for approximately 70 percent of all maintenance jobs,\nincluding most jobs pertaining to unit rebuilds. All repetitive jobs\nhave documented time and procedure standards associated with\nthem. Body repairs and diagnostic procedures, for which time\nstandards are more difficult to establish, are being developed.\nMonitoring Time\nMaintenance employees use a standard punch-in-style time\nclock to record daily work hours for payroll purposes. Start and stop\ntimes for maintenance and repair activities are written on the work\norder by the mechanic. Data entry clerks enter work order\ninformation into the management information system (MIS), which\ngenerates a variety of reports. Reports show the entire vehicle repair\nhistory, along with the amount of time each mechanic spends on\nspecific maintenance tasks. Individual times are compared with\nestablished time standards to identify substandard productivity.\nMonitoring Time to Improve\nProductivity\nIf a mechanic consistently takes too much time on a task, the\nsupervisor raises the issue on a one-on-one basis with the mechanic.\nThe supervisor reviews written work procedures with the mechanic\nto determine if he or she may require additional training. MCTS\nbelieves that bringing unproductive\nWork to an individual's attention will cause that person's\nproductivity to improve.\nTime monitoring also determines the best approach for\naccomplishing a particular job. For example, after conducting time\nstudies on brake relining, MCTS found that it is more productive to\ninclude a helper on the job to assist with routine tasks.\nTraining\nMCTS hires qualified mechanics whenever possible because its\ntraining program has been downsized. Promotional training,\npreviously held during normal work hours, now takes place outside\nthese hours. In-house training addresses remedial, new equipment,\nand update training only. Promotions are based on a battery of tests,\nwith seniority used as the tie breaker for qualified employees.\nSuccessfully completing approved classes at vocational and technical\nschools can substitute for the tests.\nProductivity Reports\nOn MCTS productivity reports, paid staff-hours spent per 1,000\nvehicle miles are classified by equipment maintenance, tire\nmaintenance, collision repairs, inspections, bus cleaning, servicing,\nand administration. Absence hours paid are classified by jury duty,\nfuneral, illness, holidays, and vacations, and hours lost to injuries are\nclassified by location and department.\nEQUIPMENT PERFORMANCE\nRoad Calls\nA road call occurs when a bus must be removed from service\nbecause of a defect that could compromise its safety and reliability.\nMCTS classifies road calls as chargeable or nonchargeable.\nNonchargeable road calls include failures caused by warranty items,\nfareboxes, destination signs, tires, vandalism, lights and passenger\nillness.\nFor 1996, the agency's goal was to attain not less than 3,000 mi\nbetween road calls. To help achieve this goal, the agency prepared a\nwritten action plan consisting of the following:\n-\nMonitor the cause of every road call to determine trends\nand initiate a plan of action to resolve problems;\n-\nComplete\nall\nscheduled\nbrake\ninspections,\nminor\ninspections, and air conditioning inspections properly and on time;\n-\nEnsure complete servicing and fueling on a daily basis;\nand\n-\nWash bus interiors on a regular basis.\nUnit Rebuild Program\nThe MCTS unit rebuild program compares in-house costs with\noutside vendor costs to determine which rebuilding service is\n\nmore cost-effective. The agency treats its in-house rebuild shop like\nan outside contractor, requiring it to compete on all 570 exchange\nunits. Some units, traditionally rebuilt in-house, have been\noutsourced as a result of cost. The agency's work force has been\ndownsized by attrition resulting from workload changes.\nMCTS believes that the greatest potential for monitoring\nmaintenance performance exists in the unit rebuild shop because of\nthe controlled environment and repetitious nature of the work.\nQuotas and Inventory Levels\nThe MCTS unit rebuild program establishes unit quotas for\neach location and determines inventory levels based on need. The\nprogram ensures the availability of rebuilt parts and eliminates\nstockpiling.\nHistorical data on component usage are used to determine\nappropriate inventory levels for each rebuilt unit. In addition, the\nprogram prioritizes workload for supervisors. Employees are\nassigned a certain amount of rebuilds and given a time requirement\nin which to complete them. Informing employees about time\nrequirements up front allows management to monitor employee\nproductivity.\nParts Replaced As Needed\nMechanics determine which parts are needed based on\nhistorical failure data, and their skills and intuition. Mechanics avoid\nreplacing parts unnecessarily, knowing that excessive costs may\nresult in losing work to outside vendors.\nRebuilt Units Monitored Closely\nMCTS monitors all unit rebuilds, including service life, cost per\nmile, premature failures, and problems inherent to each rebuild.\nMCTS uses these data to compare the effectiveness of in-house\nrebuilding with that of outsourced rebuilding.\nTwo-Part Card System for Exchange Units\nMCTS uses a two-part card system and its MIS to monitor the\nperformance of unit rebuilds. The purposes of this unit exchange card\nsystem are as follows:\n-\nDevelop cost-per-mile and cost-per-unit data;\n-\nTrack premature component failures;\n-\nIdentify problem areas;\n-\nTrack units under warranty to facilitate reimbursement;\n-\nProvide historical failure data;\n-\nProject future unit needs; and\n-\nCompare in-house performance with vendor performance.\nNot all 570 exchange units are monitored. MCTS would rather\ndo a good job of monitoring high-cost items such as transmissions,\nturbochargers, alternators, air compressors, cylinder heads, and brake\nvalves than do a mediocre job of trying to monitor all exchange units.\nA two-part tag is attached to each exchange unit after it has\nbeen rebuilt and before being placed in storage (Figure 9). The tag is\nused as follows: If the unit was rebuilt in-house, the MCTS rebuilder\nenters information on the top half of the card, including the lot\nnumber (indicating the type bus it fits), name of the rebuilder,\ngeneric part number, and serial number.\nIf the unit was rebuilt by an outside vendor, an MCTS\nstoreroom clerk enters the pertinent information. The units remain in\nstorage until they are requisitioned from one of the agency's four\nstorerooms.\n\n___________________________________________\nOnce the rebuilt item is needed on a bus, the mechanic\ncompletes the information on the tag, including the bus number\nreceiving the unit, bus mileage, problem with the defective unit, and\nmechanic's identification number.\nThe top portion of the tag then goes to the data entry clerk, who\nenters all pertinent information into the MIS. The bottom portion of\nthe tag is attached to the defective unit. Information on the rebuilt\nunit now becomes part of the vehicle history, allowing its\nperformance to be monitored.\nAnytime a bus comes in for repairs, mechanics are immediately\nmade aware of all warranty information because the computerized\nwork history program begins with a screen that shows all remaining\nwarranty periods for individual components.\nUnits rebuilt in-house are covered for the same warranty period\noffered by an outside vendor. Failures that occur within that period\nare referred to as \"quality issues.\" Quality issues are discussed with\nthe in-house staff to determine why the unit failed and to identify\nways to reduce future failures. Failures that occur during a vendor's\nwarranty period result in a warranty claim being generated.\nMCTS plans to establish an extensive database from its unit\nrebuild program, using data to predict failures and schedule\nmaintenance activities.\nEquipment Related Reports\nMCTS generates reports related to equipment. Miles per gallon\nof fuel and miles per quart of added oil are classified by each bus\ntype in the fleet. Brake relining activities are classified by bus type,\nfront and rear, and average mileage between relines. Engine rebuilds\nand transmission changes are classified by bus type and average\nmileage between rebuilds. The agency also produces reports on\nrepeat equipment failures and on-time performance for PM\ninspections.\nCONTROLLING COSTS\nData collected on failure rates and costs of rebuilt units allow\nMCTS to make key decisions concerning equipment specifications\nfor new bus orders. For example, if information indicates a cost\nadvantage of one particular component design over another, MCTS\nwill specify that design in its next bus order.\nData also are used to determine how units will be rebuilt in the\nfuture, and by whom. For example, data showed that rebuilding\nalternators (including parts and labor) in-house was less expensive\nthan having them rebuilt by an outside vendor. However, the agency\ndecided to have engine starters rebuilt by an outside vendor because\nthe costs were less.\nReports that address costs directly include the following:\n-\nCost per mile: Classified by labor, parts, fuel, oil, and\nother cost center categories.\n-\nVandalism costs: Classified by revenue vehicle and\nproperty.\nCENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION\nAUTHORITY\nBACKGROUND\nThe Central New York Regional Transportation Authority\n(CENTRO) operates nearly 200 buses in a region known for its harsh\nwinters. A fleet of 12 different bus models makes it challenging to\nmonitor maintenance performance and to ensure proper training for\nall mechanics.\nThe agency has a loyal work force with vast experience, which\nit uses to help monitor, diagnose, and solve problems. To measure\nthe productivity of its maintenance department, the agency uses a set\nof goals it calls Key End Results.\nFLEET PROFILE\nAgency\nCENTRO\nLocation\nSyracuse, New York\nService Area\n1,000 mi2 (2,590 km2)\nAnnual Miles\n5,300,000\nAnnual Ridership\n12,000,000\nNumber and Type of Facilities\nOne central maintenance facility\nAnd two satellite garages\nDays of Operation/Shifts\nMain Shop:\n7 days--3 shifts\nSatellite Garages:\nMonday-Friday--2 shifts\nNumber of Vehicles\n185 Buses\n10 Support vehicles\nMaintenance Staff\nMain Shop:\n1 Director\n3 Managers\n1 Information Manager\n1 Information Coordinator\n1 Data Entry Clerk\n2 Shift Supervisors\n3 Foremen\n37 Mechanics\n25 Service Line Employees\nGarages:\n3 Mechanics\n3 Service Line Employees\nTotal:\nMANAGEMENT PHILOSOPHY\nCENTRO believes in keeping tight control over bus\nmaintenance activities, including the distribution of work to its\nmechanics and replacement parts used in repairs. Supervisors oversee\nemployee performance on the shop floor and provide troubleshooting\nand other technical assistance when needed.\nBecause CENTRO cannot justify a research and development\ndepartment, it relies on mechanics to assist with problem solving.\nThis creates an atmosphere in which mechanics feel comfortable\nhelping management. Mechanics specialize in\n\nspecific work areas and do not rotate into the different job\nassignments.\nIncentives\nCENTRO has moved away from cash incentives to a program\nof formal recognition and gifts. For example, a letter from the\ngeneral manager and board of directors thanks employees for\noutstanding work. The Ring and Diamond Chip Award is given\nbased on longevity and achievement of safety and attendance goals.\nThe Pride and Proficiency Award is given based on technical abilities\nand professional attitude.\nMany of the agency's incentive programs rely on a team\napproach that encourages positive peer pressure to achieve goals.\nEmployee Relations and Communication\nCENTRO management relies strongly on feedback from\nmechanics to help solve problems. Mechanics become part of a team\neffort to help improve efficiency and reduce costs. Job satisfaction is\nhigh, and employee turnover is low; maintenance employees have\nworked for CENTRO an average of 11 years.\nEmployees\nattend\nmandatory\nmonthly\nmeetings\nwith\nmanagement to view safety-related films and discuss safety concerns.\nEmployees suggest ways to improve safety and management\ninstructs employees on safety procedures. The agency's safety\nprogram has reduced the number of worker compensation claims.\nEMPLOYEE PRODUCTIVITY\nSpecific goals, called Key End Results, measure management\nproductivity. These goals focus on specific occurrences, such as\nmissed or late pullouts, adherence to preventive maintenance\n(PM) schedules, and repeat failures. Each goal is accompanied by the\nmethodology by which achievement will be measured. Goals are\nestablished by management with input from the information\nmanager, who provides essential data on past performance.\nMeasuring Mechanic Productivity\nA mechanic's productivity is based on adherence to procedures\nin the Rules and Regulations Handbook and to other written job and\nmaintenance procedures.\nRules and Regulations Handbook\nThe CENTRO Rules and Regulations Handbook describes how\nmaintenance employees are expected to perform their duties. The 30\npage handbook addresses several work-related\nsubjects, including absenteeism, hygiene, work performance,\ninsubordination, gift acceptance, safety, and accident prevention.\nNext to each rule and regulation is a letter reference, which\ncites a specific disciplinary code. Disciplinary actions include\nwarnings, suspensions, and automatic discharges.\nJob Procedures\nDetailed job procedures exist for many tasks, providing\nmechanics with a step-by-step approach for completing repairs. Each\nrepair segment includes a standard time in which it must be\ncompleted. Each job procedure identifies special tools, safety\nprocedures, and other information needed to complete the work\nproperly.\nWork procedures and time standards are based on information\nprovided in OEM flat-rate manuals. Management works closely with\nmechanics to refine the time standards and procedures so that they\naccurately reflect conditions. Once a time reduction is identified, the\noverall time allotted for that activity is not reduced. Instead, other\ntasks are added to the job procedure. The intent is to reduce\nunscheduled maintenance.\nMaintenance Procedures\nMaintenance procedures establish consistency in CENTRO's\nmaintenance operation. For example, the procedure for \"work order\ncontrol\" describes how work orders are generated and completed and\nhow data entry personnel must process them Written procedures\nleave little room for interpretation concerning how work is to be\nperformed or how performance will be measured.\nCollecting Performance Data\nAn employee's time is monitored from work orders to\ndetermine whether he or she is meeting established time standards. In\naddition to examining reports generated from the management\ninformation system (MIS), CENTRO's information manager\nidentifies excessive use of time by reviewing each work order\nindividually.\nBefore assigning a work order, the foremen will inform the\nmechanic of the time standard established for the assignment. If\nmechanics do not work up to the standard, the quality control\nmanager tries to determine the reason. Work procedures are reviewed\nand a determination is made whether additional training is required.\nMonitoring repeat failures through MIS-generated reports and\nby individual review of work orders allows CENTRO to trace faulty\nworkmanship to specific employees. Performance monitoring reports\nare formatted into easy-to-read bar graphs that are posted on the\nagency's bulletin board.\nOf interest to mechanics is the Adherence to Job Standards\nreport. Performance is measured by the department's ability to adhere\nto written job procedures and time standards. The goal is to perform\nat least 95 percent of maintenance tasks within\n\n___________________________________________\nthe specified time standard. The quality control manager is tasked\nwith creating a minimum of six new standards annually.\nTraining and Advancement\nMost maintenance employees start as cleaners and servicers,\nworking themselves up through the ranks. A series of competency\ntests are used to promote mechanics from one grade level to the next.\nA consortium of New York transportation agencies, including\nCENTRO, hired a professional training firm to conduct on-site\nmaintenance training. When the need arises, management, along with\nvendors and suppliers, develop training courses to address specific\nproblems.\nLight-Duty Program Keeps Injured Workers Productive\nAs a self-insured agency, CENTRO has a light-duty work\nprogram to keep injured employees productive. Management\nbelieves that having injured employees at work allows them to see\nhow others must adapt because of their inability to work.\nManagement believes that being on the job provides these employees\nwith an incentive to get back to work.\nEQUIPMENT PERFORMANCE\nReports Monitor Equipment Performance\nCENTRO generates reports on the following factors related to\nequipment performance:\n-\nService interruptions--CENTRO uses the Federal Transit\nAdministration (FTA) definition of service interruption. The agency's\ngoal is to keep at least 6,600 mi per month between revenue service\ninterruptions for mechanical reasons.\n-\nScheduled\nversus\nunscheduled\nmaintenance-\nUnscheduled maintenance is any maintenance activity that takes\nplace between scheduled PM intervals. The goal is to schedule at\nleast 75 percent of all maintenance activities by instituting new PM\nprograms and modifying existing programs to include a broader\nscope of activity. This goal was established with input from the\ninformation manager, based on prior unscheduled maintenance\nperformance and the fleet's average age.\n-\nRepeat repairs--Include any repairs needed because of\nequipment malfunction or faulty workmanship per 100,000 mi. The\ngoal is to limit these instances to seven or fewer.\n-\nAdherence to PM schedules--PM inspections must be\nperformed within specified time and mileage intervals. The goal is to\nperform 94 percent of PM inspections within these intervals.\n-\nMissed or late pullouts--Missed or late pullouts are\ndefined as those made more than 5 min late. The goal is to limit these\npullouts to three per month.\n-\nCustomer complaints--Customer complaints are reported\non a per 100,000 mi basis. The goal is to limit complaints to 15 per\n100,000 mi.\nOther Equipment Measures\nCENTRO requires that its maintenance supervisors and\nmanagers ride buses on a monthly basis to gain firsthand experience\nconcerning customer acceptance, ride quality, cleanliness, and\nmechanical operation. A Ridership Information Card is used by\nmanagement to collect data on bus performance (Figure 8).\nPutting Performance Results\nto Work\nBased on information from its equipment performance\nmonitoring program, CENTRO initiates specific actions. All\nmechanical service interruptions and unscheduled maintenance\nactivities are classified into 19 bus systems (e.g., engine, body, and\nbrakes).\nClassifying failures into specific bus systems allows CENTRO\nto identify trends, determine the underlying cause of the problem,\nand take appropriate action to correct it. For example, an unusually\nhigh rate of unscheduled electrical repairs caused the agency to\nestablish a separate electrical PM schedule. The added inspection is\nused to take a closer look at recurring electrical problems to prevent\nroad calls and unscheduled maintenance.\nMonitoring equipment performance has resulted in some\nservice intervals being extended because the services were not\nneeded as often. One example involves the use of oil analysis to\nextend oil change intervals on compressed natural gas-powered\nbuses.\nCENTRO prints 17 lines of repair history on work orders. An\nMIS-generated report allows mechanics to identify repeat failures or\nrelated problems. If needed, mechanics can access additional vehicle\nhistory by means of the agency's computer terminal.\nInvolving the Driver\nCENTRO uses a vehicle condition report (i.e., a defect card) to\nobtain vehicle performance information from drivers, as required by\nthe U.S. Department of Transportation. The maintenance department\nalso sends a written response in the form of a problem correction\ncard to the driver, explaining how the reported problem was\naddressed.\nTo obtain an early warning of equipment failures, the agency\nencourages bus drivers to write up defects. Maintenance personnel\nare willing to spend time on the road with drivers to duplicate a\nparticular problem that may be intermittent or inherent to certain road\nconditions.\n\nPHOENIX TRANSIT SYSTEM\nBACKGROUND\nThe city of Phoenix has a contract with ATC/Vancom, Inc., to\noperate and manage the city-owned buses under the name of Phoenix\nTransit System (PTS). The city also contracts with other independent\nagencies to provide service in outlying areas PTS operates in an\nextremely warm climate in which, on average, 100 days exceed a\ntemperature of 100°F (380°C).\nFLEET PROFILE\nAgency\nPhoenix Transit System\nLocation\nPhoenix, Arizona\nService Area\n288 mi2 (749 km2)\nAnnual Miles\n5,438,571\nAnnual Ridership\n18,834,000\nNumber and Type of Facilities\nOne central maintenance facility\nAnd one satellite garage\nDays of Operation/Shifts\nCentral:\nMonday-Friday--24 hours\nSaturday-Sunday--2 shifts\nSatellite:\nMonday-Friday--24 hours\nNumber of Vehicles\n325 Buses\n48 Paratransit Vehicles\n79 Support Vehicles\nMaintenance Staff\nCentral:\n1 Assistant General Mgr\n1 Admin.

The agency has adopted a team concept\nwith service line employees and is considering a similar program for\nmechanics, in which mechanics would select their own work\nassignments. Before instituting such a program, management wants to\nestablish a more thorough performance monitoring system to\ndetermine whether the team concept increases productivity. The team\nconcept is being\n.\ntested on one maintenance shift at the agency's smaller North\nFacility.\nMonitoring/Oversight Dilemma\nPTS finds itself caught in an employee performance\nmonitoring dilemma. On the one hand, the agency would like\nemployees to set their own priorities and work schedules. On\nthe other, it does not want a detailed oversight process to detract\nfrom the perceived benefits of a team approach. Despite the\ndilemma, the agency recognizes that employee performance\nmonitoring is critical for determining whether the team concept\nis capable of increasing productivity.\nThe agency's current management information system\n(MIS) does not allow information to be linked to provide a\ndetailed analysis. A new MIS will allow the agency to develop\nwork procedures and time standards for specific maintenance\nand repair activities. The agency also plans to assign mechanics\nand drivers to specific buses in an attempt to hold them more\naccountable for their performance.\nManagement Training\nPTS has founded its own University School of\nManagement to provide managers with leadership skills. An in\nhouse \"degree\" program prepares individuals to manage, lead,\ncommunicate, improve productivity, and create a culture in\nwhich customer service is continually improved. The objective\nis to transform management into a flexible and customer-\nfocused team.\nAs a result of training, managers are expected to improve\nemployee morale, increase customer service, improve work\nquality and productivity, and enhance the quality of work life.\nManagers must complete 61, two-hour modules to earn a\ndegree.\nBusiness Solution Plan\nThe PTS Business Solution Plan 1995--2000 is intended to\nempower employees so that they can deliver world-class public\ntransit services. The plan comprises several strategic issues,\neach with its own vision and objectives. Strategic issues include\nquality\ncustomer\nservice,\ninformation\nmanagement,\nreengineering, and financial management.\nImproving Performance Through Communication\nPTS believes that effective communication is the key to\nimproving productivity. To become better communicators,\nsupervisors are taught to become people-oriented and not rely\nsolely on the \"bulletin board approach\" to communication.\nEvery Tuesday, foremen and mechanics greet bus drivers to\nshow their concern and obtain feedback on bus performance\n\n___________________________________________\nMaintenance employees meet with management on a weekly\nbasis to address technical problems, labor issues, and overall quality\nimprovement and to help prioritize work. A project status\nmemorandum, which lists the status of work priorities by bus type, is\nreviewed during these meetings. The memorandum prioritizes work\nby involving the entire department. The meetings also are used to\nreview how labor is allocated, plan vacations to minimize the effect\non productivity, and discuss how labor can be distributed more\nequitably.\nEMPLOYEE PRODUCTIVITY\nMonitoring Productivity\nPTS generates a work order for each maintenance activity. The\nmechanic enters his or her identification number, the appropriate\nrepair code, and the start and stop times for each repair. Space is\nprovided for mechanics to enter written comments to help clarify\nrepairs.\nTo track time more accurately, a pilot program requires\nmechanics to include the start and stop times for each aspect of the\nrepair (e.g., diagnostic time, time to remove a part, time to install a\npart, and so on). A data entry clerk captures all pertinent information\non the work order and enters it into the MIS.\nAll work orders are filed in cabinets for future reference. To\nobtain the repair history of a particular bus, mechanics must look for\nthese work orders manually. This system will be updated with the\nnew MIS.\nWork orders are reviewed manually by supervisors who\ninvestigate excessive time. The new MIS will evaluate all times\nautomatically and produce exception reports for supervisors to\nexamine. With PTS's current MIS, faulty workmanship is difficult to\ntrace to specific individuals.\nProductivity Reports\nPTS produces the following productivity reports:\n-\nHours Allocation--A pie chart shows how maintenance\nlabor hours were distributed for the week, month, and year. Labor\nclassifications include PM inspections, brake/air systems service, air\nconditioning service, meetings, and vacations.\n-\nMaintenance Hours per 1,000 Miles of Service--This\nreport is classified by 14 areas of bus maintenance.\n-\nLost Attendance Hours--This report includes sick days,\nholidays, and vacations.\n-\nDistribution of Labor Hours--This report includes time\nspent on scheduled and unscheduled maintenance.\n-\nRevenue/Expense Summary Sheet--This sheet includes\ncost per scheduled miles, revenue per scheduled miles, cost per\npassenger, and schedule adherence.\nTraining\nPTS hires mechanics who have basic mechanical skills, at a\nbeginning pay at 50 percent of the highest pay scale. Mechanics\nwork themselves up in 10 percent salary increments based on years\nof service and training (every mechanic receives 24 hours of training\nannually). To achieve 80 percent or more of the top pay scale,\nmechanics must pass a battery of tests.\nEQUIPMENT PERFORMANCE\nReports Monitor Equipment Performance\nPTS refers to road calls as \"bus changes.\" A variety of bus\nchange reports are formatted in color to show the daily and weekly\nperformance of each facility. Bus changes are classified by eight bus\nequipment categories to help identify problem areas. Bus repairs are\nclassified by 22 repair class codes. Although the system is not fully\nfunctional, the agency hopes to use it to monitor both labor and parts\nin an attempt to establish time standards. The standards will be used\nto schedule and allocate time for repairs.\nThe PTS repeat failure report includes a listing of all buses that\ncaused more than one service interruption within a two-week period.\nThe major inspection status sheet includes PM, brake, and air\nconditioning inspections. The agency also generates a report on\nmonthly fuel and oil usage.\nReports Used to Focus Training\nPTS uses service interruption data to focus training in areas that\nneed it the most. For example, when the agency found that\nmechanics were replacing a large number of perfectly normal\nalternators, it developed a training program to improve electrical\ndiagnostic skills.\nANN ARBOR TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY\nBACKGROUND\nThe Ann Arbor Transportation Authority (AATA) has a fleet of\nonly 80 buses, which allows the agency to become familiar with its\noverall operation in a way that agencies with larger fleets could not.\nAbout 10 years ago, road calls were occurring at an extremely high\nrate, and the agency needed to take action to reduce this rate.\nEmployee skill level, especially as it related to troubleshooting, was\nfound to be the primary cause of road calls. To improve performance,\nthe agency hired a consulting firm to train mechanics. In addition, the\nagency established a team approach to maintenance. Several two-\nmember teams are given the authority to maintain a specified number\nof buses without direct supervision.\n\nFLEET PROFILE\nAgency\nAnn Arbor Transit Authority\nLocation\nAnn Arbor, Michigan\nService Area\n75 mi2 (194 km2)\nAnnual Miles\n2,655,000\nAnnual Ridership\n4,000,000\nNumber and Type of Facilities\nOne central maintenance\nfacility\nDays of Operation/Shifts\nMonday-Friday: 24 hours\nSaturday-Sunday: 2 shifts\nNumber of Vehicles\n80 Buses\n11 Support Vehicles\nMaintenance Staff\n1 Manager\n1 Admin.

Management\ndeveloped what it calls an Ownership Program, in which a specified\nnumber of buses are assigned to several two-member teams. The\nprogram started with one team as an experiment before management\nexpanded the concept to the entire maintenance crew.\nAbout 12 buses are assigned to each team. The number of buses\nassigned to each team was determined by a trial-and-error process\nthat considered bus type, duty cycle, and the skill level of team\nmembers.\nIn creating teams, the maintenance manager tried to balance\nindividual personalities and skills. Some mechanics prefer to work\nwith certain mechanics and buses; therefore, their wishes were\naccommodated. Except for body work, each team member is\nexpected to perform every mechanical task.\nOne team focuses on unit rebuilds and major overhauls. AATA\nrebuilds all components in-house except for air conditioning\ncompressors and steering boxes.\nAn exception to the two-member team approach involves one\nemployee who has direct responsibility for warranty work. This\nindividual also helps write specifications and maintains a fleet of six\nbuses.\nKeeping the teams balanced requires personnel changes\noccasionally, especially to accommodate different personalities. All\nteams work on the \"80/20 rule,\" in which 80 percent of a team's time\nis spent working on assigned buses. The way the team spends the\nother 20 percent of its time is at management's discretion. Each team\nis assigned a bay and hoist.\nTeams are responsible for retrieving spare parts from the storeroom;\ntwo parts room clerks order and receive parts.\nMiddle Management Eliminated\nThe team approach eliminated the need for supervisors at\nAATA. Three supervisors were transferred into training and research\nand development, retaining their salary levels.\nAlthough the maintenance manager performs random spot\nchecks (thereby assuming the role of both manager and supervisor),\nteams are fully responsible for their work and perform duties without\ndirect supervision. Teams also schedule work and set priorities.\nMutual respect and trust are key to making the team concept\nwork. Balancing the oversight function with trust and respect\nprovides the greatest challenge: Too much management oversight\ncan cause resentment, whereas not enough can cause lack of\nmanagement control.\nTeam Members Assume More\nResponsibilities\nTeams are involved with writing technical specifications for\nnew bus equipment. Team members actually go to the manufacturing\nplant to inspect buses and accept them when they arrive at AATA.\nDefect cards completed by drivers go directly to the teams\nresponsible for the buses. The maintenance manager reviews all\ndefect cards daily and follows up with team members to ensure that\ndefects are corrected. If defects are not corrected, the manager meets\nwith team members and the driver to resolve each problem.\nThe team approach to maintenance has created a less stressful\nworking environment, improving both productivity and work quality.\nDownside to Team Approach\nThe biggest difficulty with the team approach involves the\nperception of other employees that maintenance personnel do not\nappear to be supervised and therefore cannot be productive. The\nmaintenance manager continually reminds concerned employees that\nservice interruptions have been reduced significantly since 1984\n(Figure 6). In addition, the reduction in service interruptions has\ncome at a time when the fleet size has increased and maintenance\nstaffing has not.\nThe distribution of overtime hours also is a concern. Union\nrules dictate that overtime hours must go to employees with the most\nseniority. The rule makes it difficult to distribute overtime hours in\ncases in which the seniority of team members differ. Another\ndifficulty involves balancing workloads between teams to ensure that\nthe distribution of work is equitable.\nSome team members have asked for more structure, fearing that\nmanagement may cancel the program because they lack direct\nsupervision. The team approach was not successful with\n\nservice line employees because they required direct supervision and\ndid not adapt well to the team concept.\nEMPLOYEE PRODUCTIVITY AND EQUIPMENT\nPERFORMANCE\nCollecting Data\nA standard work order system at AATA tracks labor and parts\nusage for individual repairs. Each work order is generated by the\nagency's management information system (MIS), which prints 17\nlines of repair history regardless of the repair (see Figure 3).\nTeam members can access other vehicle maintenance history\nby using a computer terminal. Unlike other agencies, AATA allows\nteam members to generate their own work orders. They also enter the\nstart and completion times for each repair. A clerk then transfers all\ndata from the work order into the MIS.\nPerformance Monitoring: Keep It Simple\nInstead of monitoring several performance measures as most\nagencies do, AATA is primarily concerned with only two: the\nnumber of road calls and adherence to PM intervals.\nThe agency has no interest in comparing one team with another\nbecause different buses are assigned to each team and team members'\nskill levels differ. Instead, each team is compared with itself to\ndetermine whether productivity is improving.\nRoad Calls\nMost service interruptions (road calls) are chargeable, except\nthose caused by fareboxes, destination signs, passenger illness, and\ntires. When a road call occurs, it is the team's responsibility to\nretrieve the bus and make the necessary repairs. In doing so, the team\ngains firsthand knowledge of what caused the failure so that they can\nprevent it from recurring.\nEach team is given a report showing the number of chargeable\nroad calls and the mean distance between them. An annual\naccounting of chargeable road calls by AATA is shown in Figure 6.\nSince 1985, the number of road calls has decreased by 78\npercent. The average fleet age, a key factor that must be considered\nwhen evaluating road call performance, is 7.9 years.\nAdherence to PM Schedules\nEach team receives a report showing the mileage remaining\nuntil the next scheduled PM inspection for each bus. PM inspections\nare divided into intervals of 6,000, 12,000, 36,000, and 100,000 mi.\nThe report includes the date and mileage of the last PM\ninspection and the mileage remaining until the next PM\ninspection. Team members review the report to help prioritize and\nschedule work.\nOnce a PM inspection is completed, team members remain with\nthe bus to repair any problems discovered during the inspection\nprocess.\nOther Performance Measures\nAATA once monitored the failure rate of specific bus\ncomponents in an attempt to establish optimum replacement\nintervals. The agency ended the program and now authorizes team\nmembers to make these decisions because, ultimately, team members\nare responsible for any road calls that result from component failures.\nAATA does not monitor the frequency of late or missed\npullouts because, according to management, they \"are not allowed to\nhappen.\" The agency uses a survey to obtain passenger feedback.\nThe agency tried to establish performance goals for additional\nmeasures but gave up on the concept. According to the maintenance\nmanager, the administrative time and expense was not worth the\neffort. Instead, the manager spends time on the shop floor inspecting\nteam activities to ensure an acceptable level of productivity.\nTraining and Advancement\nIn addition to training, the consultant hired by AATA\nestablished a merit-based system for advancement. Employees\nreceive step-by-step, written procedures needed to progress from one\ngrade level to the next. Each job level is clearly defined and includes\nthe training and test procedures required for advancement. This\nallows employees to advance at their own pace. Employees are\nrequired to take a battery of tests consisting of written, oral, and\nhands-on segments.\nOnce in place, the consultant turned the advancement program\nover to AATA's training instructor to administer. This instructor\nassists team members with troubleshooting and other maintenance\nactivities when required. In addition, the agency takes full advantage\nof original equipment manufacturer (OEM) training programs,\nespecially those pertaining to new buses and products.\nAATA mechanics are classified as master (the top category)\nand at A, B, or C levels. Fifty percent of all mechanics are at the\nmaster level; the remainder are at A or B levels. All mechanics are\nencouraged to achieve the master level. Sufficient funds are set aside\nin the annual budget to pay each mechanic at the highest salary level.\nIncentives\nAATA uses annual cash incentives to reward maintenance\nemployees who have perfect attendance and safety records (i.e., no\nwork-related injuries). Employees receive $100 for one year with a\nperfect attendance or safety record, $300 for\n\nthe second consecutive year, and $500 for the third consecutive year.\nCONTROLLING COSTS\nAATA monitors maintenance costs on a per-mile basis, broken\ndown by labor, parts, outside repairs, fuel, oil, tires,\nbus type, and other factors. During the first few years of the team\napproach, AATA exceeded established budget levels.\nAccording to the maintenance manager, the increased\nproductivity resulting from the team concept increased PM activities\nand caused an increase in spending. Now that the buses are in better\nmechanical condition, however, the budgets have stabilized.\n\nTHE TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH BOARD is a unit of the National Research Council, which serves the National\nAcademy of Sciences and the National Academy of Engineering It evolved in 1974 from the Highway Research Board, which\nwas established in 1920. The TRB incorporates all former HRB activities and also performs additional functions under a broader\nscope involving all modes of transportation and the interactions of transportation with society. The Board's purpose is to\nstimulate research concerning the nature and performance of transportation systems, to disseminate information that the research\nproduces, and to encourage the application of appropriate research findings. The Board's program is carried out by more than 270\ncommittees, task forces, and panels composed of more than 3,300 administrators, engineers, social scientists, attorneys,\neducators, and others concerned with transportation; they serve without compensation. The program is supported by state\ntransportation and highway departments, the modal administrations of the U.S. Department of Transportation, the Association of\nAmerican Railroads, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, and other organizations and individuals interested in\nthe development of transportation.\nThe National Academy of Sciences is a private, nonprofit, self-perpetuating society of distinguished scholars engaged in\nscientific and engineering research, dedicated to the furtherance of science and technology and to their use for the general\nwelfare. Upon the authority of the charter granted to it by the Congress in 1863, the Academy has a mandate that requires it to\nadvise the federal government on scientific and technical matters. Dr Bruce Alberts is president of the National Academy of\nSciences.\nThe National Academy of Engineering was established in 1964, under the charter of the National Academy of Sciences, as a\nparallel organization of outstanding engineers It is autonomous in its administration and in the selection of its members, sharing\nwith the National Academy of Sciences the responsibility for advising the federal government. The National Academy of\nEngineering also sponsors engineering programs aimed at meeting national needs, encourages education and research, and\nrecognizes the superior achievements of engineers. Dr. Robert M.White is president of the National Academy of Engineering.\nThe Institute of Medicine was established in 1970 by the National Academy of Sciences to secure the services of eminent\nmembers of appropriate professions in the examination of policy matters pertaining to the health of the public. The Institute acts\nunder the responsibility given to the National Academy of Sciences by its congressional charter to be an adviser to the federal\ngovernment and, upon its own initiative, to identify issues of medical care, research, and education. Dr. Kenneth\nI. Shine is president of the Institute of Medicine.\nThe National Research Council was organized by the National Academy of Sciences in 1916 to associate the broad\ncommunity of science and technology with the Academy's purposes of furthering knowledge and advising the federal\ngovernment. Functioning in accordance with general policies determined by the Academy, the Council has become the principal\noperating agency of both the National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Engineering in providing services to\nthe government, the public, and the scientific and engineering communities The Council is administered jointly by both\nAcademies and the Institute of Medicine. Dr. Bruce Alberts and Dr. Robert M. White are chairman and vice chairman,\nrespectively, of the National Research Council."

WILLIAMS, Transportation Research Board\nTransportation Research Board\nNational Research Council\nResearch Sponsored by the Federal Transit Administration in\nCooperation with the Transit Development Corporation\nNATIONAL ACADEMY PRESS\nWashington, D.C. 1999\n\nTRANSIT COOPERATIVE RESEARCH PROGRAM\nThe nation's growth and the need to meet mobility,\nenvironmental, and energy objectives place demands on public\ntransit systems. Current systems, some of which are old and in need\nof upgrading, must expand service area, increase service frequency,\nand improve efficiency to serve these demands. Research is\nnecessary to solve operating problems, to adapt appropriate new\ntechnologies from other industries, and to introduce innovations into\nthe transit industry. The Transit Cooperative Research Program\n(TCRP) serves as one of the principal means by which the transit\nindustry can develop innovative near-term solutions to meet demands\nplaced on it.\nThe need for TCRP was originally identified in TRB Special\nReport 213--Research for Public Transit: New Directions, published\nin 1987 and based on a study sponsored by the Federal Transit\nAdministration (FTA). A report by the American Public Transit\nAssociation (APTA), Transportation 2000, also recognized the need\nfor local, problem-solving research. TCRP, modeled after the\nlongstanding and successful National Cooperative Highway Research\nProgram, undertakes research and other technical activities in\nresponse to the needs of transit service providers. The scope of vice\nconfiguration, equipment, facilities, operations, human resources,\nmaintenance, policy, and administrative practices.\nTCRP was established under FTA sponsorship in July 1992.\nProposed by the U.S. Department of Transportation, TCRP was\nauthorized as part of the Intermodal Surface Transportation\nEfficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA). On May 13, 1992, a memorandum\nagreement outlining TCRP operating procedures was executed by the\nthree cooperating organizations: FTA, the National Academy of\nSciences, acting through the Transportation Research Board (TRB),\nand the Transit Development Corporation, Inc. (TDC), a nonprofit\neducational and research organization established by APTA. TDC is\nresponsible for forming the independent governing board, designated\nas the TCRP Oversight and Project Selection (TOPS) Committee\nResearch problem statements for TCRP are solicited\nperiodically but may be submitted to TRB by anyone at anytime. It is\nthe responsibility of the TOPS Committee to formulate the research\nprogram by identifying the highest priority projects. As part of the\nevaluation, the TOPS Committee defines funding levels and expected\nproducts.\nOnce selected, each project is assigned to an expert panel,\nappointed by the Transportation Research Board The panels prepare\nproject statements (requests for proposals), select contractors, and\nprovide technical guidance and counsel throughout the life of the\nproject. The process for developing research problem statements and\nselecting research agencies has been used by TRB in managing\ncooperative research programs since 1962. As in other TRB\nactivities,\nTCRP\nproject\npanels\nserve\nvoluntarily\nwithout\ncompensation\nBecause research cannot have the desired impact if products\nfail to reach the intended audience, special emphasis is placed on\ndisseminating TCRP results to the intended end-users of the research:\ntransit agencies, service providers, and suppliers. TRB provides a\nseries of research reports, syntheses of transit practice, and other\nsupporting material developed by TCRP research. APTA will\narrange for workshops, training aids, field visits, and other activities\nto ensure that results are implemented by urban and rural transit\nindustry practitioners.\nThe TCRP provides a forum where transit agencies can\ncooperatively address common operational problems. TCRP results\nsupport and complement other ongoing transit research and training\nprograms.\nTCRP SYNTHESIS 33\nProject J-7, Topic SF-06\nISSN 1073-4880\nISBN 0-309-06860-6\nLibrary of Congress Catalog Card No. 99-076878\n(c) 1999 Transportation Research Board\nPrice $27.00\nNOTICE\nThe project that is the subject of this report was a part of the Transit\nCooperative Research Program conducted by the Transportation\nResearch Board with the approval of the Governing Board of the\nNational Research Council.

This information has resulted from research and from the successful\napplication of solutions to problems by individuals or organizations. There is a\ncontinuing need to provide a systematic means for compiling this information and\nmaking it available to the entire transit community in a usable format. The Transit\nCooperative Research Program includes a synthesis series designed to search for and\nsynthesize useful knowledge from all available sources and to prepare documented\nreports on current practices in subject areas of concern to the transit industry.\nThis synthesis series reports on various practices, making specific\nrecommendations where appropriate but without the detailed directions usually\nfound in handbooks or design manuals. Nonetheless, these documents can serve\nsimilar purposes, for each is a compendium of the best knowledge available on those\nmeasures found to be successful in resolving specific problems. The extent to which\nthese reports are useful will be tempered by the user's knowledge and experience in\nthe particular problem area.\nThis synthesis will be of interest to transit agency managers, operations, and\nhuman resources staffs who are responsible for attracting and retaining good\nemployees. It will also be of interest to others who interact with transit agencies to\nhelp employees succeed. This synthesis presents state of the practice information\nabout the various actions transit agencies (and other employers) have taken to help\nensure the availability of quality employees in an increasingly competitive\nemployment environment. It focuses on the practices and policies transit agencies\nhave put in place to help minimize absenteeism at their agencies, from which other\nagencies may find useful applications.\nAdministrators, practitioners, and researchers are continually faced with issues\nor problems on which there is much information, either in the form of reports or in\nterms of undocumented experience and practice. Unfortunately, this information\noften is scattered or not readily available in the literature, and, as a consequence, in\nseeking solutions, full information on what has been learned about an issue or\nproblem is not assembled. Costly research findings may go unused, valuable\nexperience may be overlooked, and full consideration may not be given to the\navailable methods of solving or alleviating the issue or problem. In an effort to\ncorrect this situation, the Transit Cooperative Research Program (TCRP) Synthesis\nProject, carried out by the Transportation Research Board as the research agency, has\nthe objective of reporting on common transit issues and problems and synthesizing\navailable information. The synthesis reports from this endeavor constitute a TCRP\npublication series in which various forms of relevant information are assembled into\nsingle, concise documents pertaining to a specific problem or closely related issues.\nThis document from the Transportation Research Board addresses three basic\ncategories: (1)\nPreventive Measures, designed to stop absenteeism from\noccurring; (2)\nManagement Interventions, utilized to deal with absenteeism that\ndoes occur; and (3)\nOther Management Strategies. In particular, it focuses concern\non practices related to employee selection, internal motivation of employees, labor-\nmanagement cooperation, supervisory involvement, incentive and discipline\nprograms, and workers compensation programs.\n\nTo develop this synthesis in a comprehensive manner and to ensure inclusion of significant knowledge,\navailable information was assembled from numerous sources, including a number of public transportation agencies.\nA topic panel of experts inthe subject area was established to guide the researchers in organizing and evaluating the\ncollected data, and to review the final synthesis report.\nThis synthesis is an immediately useful document that records practices that were acceptable within the\nlimitations of the knowledge available at the time of its preparation. As the processes of advancement continue, new\nknowledge can be expected to be added to that now at hand.\n\nCONTENTS\n1.\nSUMMARY\nCHAPTER ONE\nINTRODUCTION\nThe Critical Nature of Employee Availability in the Transit Industry,3\nThe Competitive Marketplace for Employees, 3\nA New Generation's Changing Work Ethic?, 5\nChallenges Presented by the Family Medical Leave Act, 6\nSynthesis Objectives, 6\nSynthesis Methods and Organization, 7\nCHAPTER TWO\nABSENTEEISM FROM THE POINTS OF VIEW\nOF TRANSIT MANAGEMENT AND LABOR\nBus Operators' Backgrounds, 10\nSchedules, 10\nEquipment and Facilities, 10\nSecurity and Passengers, 11\nPersonal Needs/Inflexible Rules, 11\nOther Bus Operators, 12\nInsufficient Communication/Nonsupportive Supervision, 12\n14 CHAPTER THREE\nSTRATEGIES USED BY TRANSIT AGENCIES TO\nMAXIMIZE EMPLOYEE AVAILABILITY\nPreventive Measures, 14\nManagement Controls on the Use of Sick Leave, 30\nOther Management Interventions, 36\n43 CHAPTER FOUR\n45 REFERENCES\n47 APPENDIX A\n55 APPENDIX B\n56 APPENDIX C\n57 APPENDIX D\n60 APPENDIX E\n64 APPENDIX F\n69 APPENDIX G\nCONCLUSIONS\nSURVEY QUESTIONNAIRE\nSURVEY RESPONDENTS\nMAP OF SURVEYED RESPONDENTS\nTHE LIFE OF A RELIEF TRANSIT OPERATOR AT\nPIERCE TRANSIT\nBROWARD COUNTY TRANSIT: OPERATIONS RULES\nAND REGULATIONS AND OPERATOR'S MANUAL\nTARC ATTENDANCE POLICY\nPIERCE TRANSIT REDEPLOYMENT PROGRAM\n\nTCRP COMMITTEE FOR PROJECT J-7\nCHAIR\nPATRICIA V.McLAUGHLIN\nMIG, Inc.\nMEMBERS\nGERALD BLAIR\nIndiana County Transit Authority\nKENNETH J.DUEKER\nCenter for Urban Studies\nL.G.

Their cooperation and assistance are appreciated.\n\nPRACTICES IN ASSURING EMPLOYEE\nAVAILABILITY\nSUMMARY\nThe National Transit Database (Federal Transit Administration, U.S. Department of\nTransportation) for report year 1996 indicates that labor and fringe benefits\ncomprised 76.4 percent of operating expenses at transit agencies in the United States\n(National Transit Summaries and Trends for the 1996 National Transit Database).\nGiven the significance of labor expenses at transit agencies, identifying and\ndocumenting actions to enhance worker performance in terms of attendance can\nyield significant benefits. Assuring employee availability is a challenge facing transit\ndaily and will be a growing challenge in the future. Information is needed about\ncurrent practices in controlling absenteeism and improving worker availability.\nThis report explores the various actions transit agencies (and other employers)\nhave taken to help ensure the availability of quality employees in an increasingly\ncompetitive employment environment. Information in the report is based on survey\nresults received from 36 transit agencies from throughout the United States, as well\nas specific information received from a half-dozen other transit agencies that were\nnot asked to respond to the full survey. Six different focus groups were facilitated\nwith 57 bus operators from a large transit agency to get a perspective on absenteeism\nfrom the employees' point of view. In addition, an extensive literature review was\nconducted to obtain information on how other public and private agencies were\ndealing with the subject of employee availability.\nThe report focuses primarily on the practices and policies transit agencies have\nput in place to help minimize absenteeism. These practices fall into three basic\ncategories: (1) preventive measures that are designed to prevent absences from\noccurring, (2) management interventions that are used to deal with absenteeism that\ndoes occur, and (3)\nother management strategies.\nAlthough many transit agencies continue to be plagued with high levels of\nabsenteeism, a number of techniques that help improve attendance performance are\nbeing used successfully. The utilization of customized selection instruments and tests\nfor job applicants has helped transit agencies develop better personal profiles of\npotential employees. Transit agencies have expressed satisfaction with the tests'\npredictive capabilities of new employees' attendance performance. Transit agencies\nhave increased their chances of minimizing absenteeism by improving the health of\ntheir employees through wellness programs, health screenings, ergonomic\nequipment, and training programs. Employee Assistance Programs help employees\ncope with life's various pressures and provide much needed counseling for dealing\nwith such stress. Day care centers located at transit facilities are believed to reduce\nabsenteeism among parent/employees with young children, though there has been no\ncost-benefit analysis to determine if the subsidized cost of the day care service is\noffset by savings in reduced absenteeism.\nAlthough there is considerable disagreement over the ability of financial\nincentives to improve attendance, there is growing evidence that larger cash rewards\nbased on performance periods of less than a year are much more achievable, popular,\nand successful than\n\nprograms that require perfect attendance for a full year. Lottery programs that offer cash prizes and/or gift\ncertificates to those with excellent attendance records have also been popular and effective.\nTransit agencies are providing represented (union) employees with more flexibility in their use of time off.\nMany agencies allow their bus operators to swap days off with other operators who have similar work shifts, and a\nnumber of agencies allow their bus operators to take some of their annual leave in daily rather than weekly\nincrements. These flexibility provisions help minimize absenteeism and foster better relations between represented\nemployees and management.\nTighter controls on the use of sick leave usually result in less absenteeism. It was remarkable how many\nagencies admitted to not doing a good job of tracking absenteeism or enforcing attendance regulations. Those\nagencies that take these responsibilities seriously, and dedicate resources and time to attend to such functions,\ninvariably enjoy better attendance. This practice alerts employees that their performance is being monitored, and\nalso provides managers with the opportunities to identify the causes of employees' absenteeism on a regular basis.\nConsequently, they are in a better position to assist employees with improving their performance.\nA number of transit agencies have come to realize that there is a vital connection between attendance and how\nwell the agency establishes more personal, ongoing relationships with its employees. There may be serious\n\"disconnects\" between represented employees and management at transit agencies, where transit managers have lost\ntouch with the pressures and unfavorable working conditions with which bus operators in particular must deal.\nFocus groups of bus operators held at one large transit agency consistently reported on poor equipment and\nfacilities, unrealistic schedules, inadequate supervisory support, difficult passengers, and the absence of\ncommunication with anyone in the agency. Those operators have basically determined that the agency doesn't care\nabout them; therefore, they are not going to be terribly concerned with taking a few days off sick when they feel the\nneed to just get away from the pressures of driving a bus.\nA number of transit agencies realize that the external environment is causing them to reconsider some of their\nhiring practices. A red-hot national economy has created an \"employees' market\" in many regions where\nunemployment is very low. Hiring reliable part-time employees has become a particular challenge when there are so\nmany other job opportunities where pay is comparable and that provide better working conditions than those faced\nby low-seniority bus operators (who invariably are assigned the worst routes, days off, and work shifts). There is\nalso a feeling that the new generation of workers has different attitudes toward employer loyalty and the value of\nleave time. In addition, there is a growing recognition that not only single parents, but households with two working\nparents as well, have family responsibilities that will be given priority over work responsibilities now more than in\nthe past. Some transit managers believe that perfect attendance is no longer a reasonable expectation, and they have\nset their sights on reducing excessive absenteeism as a more realistic goal.\nThere is significant evidence that transit agencies have found ways to help achieve reasonable employee\navailability. Although the methods to do this require work, resources, and possibly organizational change, they are\nwell worth implementing to ensure better service to the public, better bottom line budgets, and better ongoing\nrelationships between employees and managers.\n\nCHAPTER ONE\nINTRODUCTION\nTHE CRITICAL NATURE OF EMPLOYEE\nAVAILABILITY IN THE TRANSIT INDUSTRY\nEmployee availability is a key factor in public transit agencies for\nmany reasons. Unlike most other public services, and certainly unlike\ntypical office environments, transit agencies are obligated to provide\nprecise service in accordance with a published schedule. Buses and\ntrains simply must be where the schedules say they are going to be or\nthe level of trust passengers have in the service will diminish,\nridership and revenue will decrease, and the agency will fail to\naccomplish its primary mission of providing safe, reliable mobility to\nthe region it serves. To ensure that this primary mission is\naccomplished, employees must be available when scheduled service\ndemands their presence.\nIn spite of the fundamental importance of attendance to transit\nagencies, bus operators experience as much as three times the\naverage rate of absenteeism as other blue-collar workers (1).\nIdentifying and documenting actions to enhance better attendance\ncan have significant financial benefits for labor-intensive transit\nagencies. For instance, the Miami--Dade Transit Agency determined\nthat it would need 26 fewer bus operators on its \"extra board\" (the\nroster of bus operators needed to work for those operators who are\nabsent) if the absence rate could be reduced from 20 to 18 percent\n(2). The Santa Clara Valley Transit Authority determined that every\n1 percent increase in absenteeism among their represented (union)\nemployees costs the agency $1 million in overtime or added\npersonnel to replace the absent employees and protect the service\npromised to the public. In 1980, estimates of the annual national cost\nof bus operator absence were set at $294 million. Translated into\n1995 dollars, this amounts to in excess of $3,750 per operator per\nyear (3).\nBeyond the purely budgetary impacts, high levels of\nabsenteeism, particularly among bus operators, can also lead to other\norganizational inefficiencies and problems. Jacobs and Conte have\ndescribed the negative cyclical process that can be started when\nabsenteeism becomes excessive at a transit agency (3):\nDelays (in service) occur because the replacement drivers\nare often less familiar with routes and traffic patterns.\nDelays can lead to dissatisfied customers who in turn opt\nfor alternative transportation methods. As properties\nexperience lower levels of ridership, budget cuts and\nother cost reduction methods are instituted with\npredictable drops in driver morale and job satisfaction.\nThis leads to added job stress and increases in employee\nabsences.\nAs noted above, unscheduled absences cost transit agencies a\ntremendous amount of money. They also add a considerable\nadministrative burden. One large transit agency on the West Coast\nreports that 70 percent of all its disciplinary actions concern\nemployees with attendance problems. In addition, high levels of\nunscheduled absences can lead to lower morale within a work force.\nUnnecessary absences result in hardships for other employees, who\nmay be required to work when they had otherwise expected to be off\n(4).\nIn spite of the critical importance of good attendance, this\nelement of employee performance is a significant problem for many\npublic transit agencies. Of the 36 transit agencies surveyed for this\nsynthesis project, 39 percent (14)stated that absenteeism in their\nagency has gone up in the past 5 years, whereas only 14 percent (5)\nreported that absenteeism had gone down (Figure 1).\nThe 36 selected systems surveyed for this synthesis were asked\nthe following question: \"On a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 meaning there\nis no problem and 10 meaning there is a serious problem, how do you\nrate the level of absenteeism in your agency?\" The average rating for\nall 36 agencies was 6.97. The most frequent rating given was 8. As\nFigure 2 shows, one-half of all reporting agencies rated themselves 8\nor higher. This strongly suggests that absenteeism and employee\navailability are serious problems in a high percentage of transit\nagencies.\nThe survey used for this project also asked, \"What is the\naverage number of days of unscheduled absence per year, per\nbargaining unit employee?\" Regrettably, 14 of the 36 agencies did\nnot know the level of absenteeism in their agency. Of the 22 agencies\nthat did respond, the annual level of unscheduled absenteeism ranged\nfrom 3 to 52 days, with an average of 16.07. The reader should note\nthat these numbers do not include predictable, scheduled absences\nsuch as annual leave or personal days. These numbers only address\nunscheduled absence, the bulk of which is attributable to sick leave,\nwith workers compensation leave and Family Medical Leave having\nmuch less of an impact.\nTHE COMPETITIVE MARKETPLACE\nFOR EMPLOYEES\nThere are numerous factors that affect employee availability, many\nof which are within a transit agency's ability to\n\ncontrol or influence. However, there are other factors in the external\nenvironment that influence employee availability to which transit\nagencies can only react. Eleven of the 36 transit agencies reported\nthat more attractive pay and benefits offered by other employers in\ntheir region contribute to attrition and employee unavailability. Most\nof the transit agencies reporting this as a problem are in regions with\nvery low unemployment (3 percent or less.) In these circumstances,\nemployers are willing to pay more competitive wages and provide\nbetter benefits to attract and keep good employees.\nOne of the actions that many transit managers admit contributes\nto absenteeism is the use of part-time bus operators. A number of\ntransit agencies now use part-time employees, and many of those\nagencies require that all new bus operators be first hired as part-time\nemployees. In many cases, the pay for part-time employees is\nrelatively low, and benefits are reduced or not provided at all. In a\nfull-employment economy, most agencies report that it is difficult to\nattract and/or retain good mechanics and bus\noperators. At Seattle Metro Transit, the number of part-time bus\noperators in the agency has dropped from 1,000 to fewer than 800 in\nthe past year. This rate of attrition obviously leads to problems with\nemployee availability.\nIt is impossible to tell part-time bus operators exactly when\nthey can expect to become full-time employees (although many\nreport that it averages about 1 year.) During that time, part-time bus\noperators might find other full-time work with better hours and better\nbenefits, and leave the transit agency in spite of prospects for a full-\ntime operator's job in the not-too-distant future. One agency reported\nthat it is not unusual for part-time operators to leave the agency after\nthey have been trained and receive their Commercial Drivers\nLicense. They will often go to work for over-the-road truck\ncompanies, some of whom have been recruiting from Eastern\nEuropean countries to fill positions.\nAccording to Carmen W. Daecher of Safety, Claims &\nLitigation Services, Inc., in Camp Hill, Pennsylvania,\n\n\"There is a shortage of drivers for all commercial vehicles, and, as\nthe economy improves, fewer remain as drivers. Someone will train a\ndriver, then the driver will look for a better job driving elsewhere\"\n(5).\nTransit agencies that have developed two-tier wage systems, or\nwho rely on part-time employees, have noticed dramatic attrition.\nTurnover among part-time bus operators was reported to be as high\nas 50 percent at one mid-sized transit agency in the past year (6).\nWhen an area's economy is booming, it is difficult to attract or retain\nemployees with the offer of part-time work, low starting wages, and\nno benefits. One transit agency reported that they experience high\nfailure rate on physical exams and job skill tests, whereas many\nothers noted they are not attracting high caliber candidates to part-\ntime positions. Employees in hot economies know there are a lot of\njob opportunities. According to several transit agencies in areas of\nlow unemployment, some fast food restaurants pay their employees\nbetter wages than that of starting bus operators and offer substantial\ncash bonuses for employees who stay with the company for 6\nmonths. One agency recently reported losing a part-time bus operator\nto a local factory that offered new employees $500 signing bonuses.\nDriving a bus simply isn't attractive work to a lot of people.\nPart-time bus driving is distinctly unattractive to mothers with\nchildren who might want to work part-time, but need a regular\nschedule. A number of transit systems are reassessing their use of\npart-time bus operators and just how part-timers are paid. Two\nagencies reported that they are moving away from the use of part-\ntime operators. One agency in a tourist-oriented economy is hiring\nmore full-time operators, but asking them to take their vacations in\nthe off-tourist portions of the year. In Denver, where unemployment\nis 1.7%, the starting hourly rate for part-time bus operators was\nrecently raised $2 an hour to be more competitive in an \"employees'\nmarket.\"\nOne transit manager noted that he believes part-time operators\nactually have better attendance than full-time employees because\ntheir wages are low and they can't afford to miss work. However,\nanother agency reported that part-time employees often need another\njob to make ends meet. These employees sometimes get tired from\nworking the other job and call in sick when they don't have the\nenergy to work their transit shift.\nMany agencies note that it is currently not a good market for\nhiring part-time employees. The use of part-time bus operators may\nhave made good sense when unemployment was much higher. In\nareas where unemployment is less than 3 percent, the competition for\ngood employees is particularly fierce.\nA NEW GENERATION'S CHANGING\nWORK ETHIC?\nEmployees who are between the ages of 24 and 35 (born between\n1965 and 1976) have come to be referred to as members of\n\"Generation X.\" This synthesis project certainly provides no\nscientific analyses of work habits of this generation. However, the\nsurvey questionnaire asked transit managers if they detected the new\ngeneration's attitude toward work and loyalty to the employer. Better\nthan one-half (19 of 36) replied affirmatively; the most common\nresponse being that younger employees seem to lack a sense of\ncommitment to their job. A number of agencies noted how younger\nemployees seem to value their leisure time more (\"I'll do anything\nyou want, as long as you don't interfere with my leisure time\"). A\nnumber of agencies stated that the generation of employees that has\ngrown up in the 1990s has never been through tough economic times\nand doesn't understand the value of a stable job. They note that many\nyoung employees still live with their parents and simply lack a sense\nof responsibility that might come with paying a mortgage or serious\nrent.\nOther agencies stated that there is a deterioration in the work\nethic of younger employees who treat their jobs in a rather\nentrepreneurial, mercenary way. They regard themselves as\n\"resources,\" no more, no less, that are there to do a job and get out.\nThey don't think of themselves as being part of some \"work family.\"\nIn a good economy, they feel there are better jobs somewhere else,\nand they will stay only until they find something better. Some\nagencies noted that there is more absenteeism and turnover among\nyounger employees. There is also recognition that the new generation\nhas grown up seeing stories of major downsizing by employers,\nwhile hearing they should expect to change their careers on average\nsix times in their lives.\nMost of these observations by transit managers are confirmed\nby Bob Losyk, President and CEO of Innovative Training Solutions,\nInc., of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and author of the book Managing a\nChanging Workforce: Achieving Outstanding Service with Today's\nEmployees (7). He notes that the loyalty and commitment to the\nworkplace that previous generations had is gone. Too often\nGeneration Xers saw their parents' dedication to a company repaid\nwith downsizing and layoffs. Consequently, he believes young\npeople feel that there is no such thing as job security. They won't\nwait around and pay their dues when there is no long-term\ncommitment from management. His studies lead him to conclude that\nGeneration Xers look to jump ship when they can upgrade their\nsituations, and often leave a job at the hint of a better position. Losyk\nbelieves that Generation X will bring many positive developments in\nthe workplace. However, he also concurs with transit managers'\nobservations that Generation Xers strongly believe there is life after\nwork\n\nand that work is only a means to their ends: money, fun, and leisure.\nCHALLENGES PRESENTED BY THE\nFAMILY MEDICAL LEAVE ACT\nThe most frequently cited external factor that affects transit\nemployee availability is the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA). The\nFMLA has presented challenges to many agencies, and there is no\neasy or quick method to resolve the problems associated with it.\nAlthough the FMLA's intent is positive for most situations, many\ntransit managers believe it provides an opportunity for those who\nhave a low sense of responsibility or interest toward their job with\nanother opportunity to stay out of the workplace when they feel like\nit.\nThis federal legislation provides employees with up to 12\nworkweeks of unpaid, job-protected leave a year, and requires group\nhealth benefits to be maintained during the leave as if employees\ncontinued to work instead of taking leave. To be eligible for leave\ncovered by FMLA, employees must have worked for the employer\nfor at least 12 months, and worked at least 1,250 hours during the 12\nmonths prior to the start of the FMLA leave. Leave may be taken for\nthe following reasons:\n-\nFor the birth of a son or daughter, and to care for the\nnewborn child;\n-\nFor the placement with the employee of a child through\nadoption or foster care, and to care for the newly placed\nchild;\n-\nTo care for an immediate family member (spouse, child,\nor parent--but not a parent in-law); and\n-\nWhen the employee is unable to work because of a\nserious health condition.\n\"Serious health condition\" means an illness, injury, impairment, or\nphysical or mental condition that includes, among other things:\n-\nA period of incapacity requiring the absence of more than\nthree calendar days from work, school, or other regular\ndaily activities that also involves continuing treatment by\n(or under the supervision of) a health care provider; and\n-\nAny period of incapacity (or treatment therefor) due to a\nchronic serious health condition (e.g., asthma, diabetes,\nepilepsy, etc.).\nThe FMLA permits employees to take leave on an intermittent\nbasis or to work a reduced schedule under certain circumstances.\nIntermittent/reduced schedule leave may be taken when medically\nnecessary to care for a seriously ill family member or because of the\nemployee's serious health condition.\nTwenty-six of the 36 agencies surveyed reported that this\nlegislation has affected employee availability. At least 10 of the\nagencies expressed extreme concern with FMLA's effects, referring\nto the legislation as \"a nightmare,\" \"a disaster,\" or \"a royal pain.\"\nMany expressed their concern over how FMLA has \"bastardized\" the\nprogressive discipline process. The legislation does not allow\nemployers to take negative action, such as demotions or disciplinary\naction, against employees taking FMLA leave. Some agencies report\nthat \"abusers are learning how to play the game\" and \"run around the\nsystem.\" Some agencies reported the FMLA is \"killing them\"\nbecause such leave is not counted against the employee in the\ndisciplinary process. They claim unions coach their members to file\nunder FMLA if possible when taking leave to avoid such absences\nbeing counted against their progressive discipline record.\nTransit managers state that they have no problem with the act's\nprovisions for employees to be granted leave to care for a sick family\nmember or a newborn child, or to recover from a verifiably serious\nhealth condition or injury. The major point of contention is with the\nFMLA\nprovision\nthat\npermits\nemployees\nto\ntake\n\"intermittent/reduced schedule leave\" because of a \"serious health\ncondition.\" The frustration comes from trying to operationalize the\ndefinition of serious health condition. It is difficult to confirm or\ndeny the effect of certain health conditions such as gout, migraines,\nsoft-tissue injuries, depression, and even \"irritable bowel syndrome.\"\nTransit managers report that cases of Hepatitis C, where infections\nare contracted through sexual activity, are commonly reported and\ncause for leave based on the definitions of FMLA. More than one\nagency complained that getting doctors' notes for FMLA leave is too\nsimple and that doctors are reluctant not to approve an employee's\nrequest for FMLA leave for fear of being sued. Once an employee is\ncertified as having a condition under FMLA, they don't need to\nsubmit updated doctors' certificates for 60 days. Agencies are\nrestricted in their ability to discipline those who they think are\nabusing this provision and who, perhaps, are only working 4 days a\nweek. At least one agency stated that they believe their employees\nwho take FMLA leave are working other jobs.\nSome agencies reported that they have offered input to\nprofessional human resource associations that have drafted proposed\namendments to the FLMA legislation, but nothing has resulted from\nthese efforts yet.\nSYNTHESIS OBJECTIVES\nThe purpose of this synthesis report is to review the state of the art in\npractices used by selected transit agencies in assuring employee\navailability. There are a variety of factors that transit agencies must\nbe mindful of as they attempt to assure themselves that they will have\nthe employees\n\nnecessary to provide the service promised to the public, in a manner\nthat is fiscally responsible. As this report is being written, the nation's\neconomy has grown and unemployment in many markets has become\nalmost nonexistent. There is fierce competition for good job\napplicants in all types of employment. This competition affects how\nsuccessful transit agencies will be in attracting and retaining\nemployees now and in the foreseeable future. It will also cause them\nto question their own practices in areas such as the use of part-time\nemployees, hourly wages, the provision of benefits, and selection of\ncandidates for job openings.\nAt the same time, many agencies feel that new attitudes toward\nwork and employer loyalty are evolving throughout the country. This\nmay be attributable in part to different approaches the \"20\nsomething\" generation has toward their careers and priorities in life.\nIt may also be partly attributable to the changing nature of\nhouseholds, where the proportion of families with two working\nparents is now 64.5 percent, and 64.8 percent of mothers of children\nunder the age of six are now at work (8). The percentage of women\nin the work force with children under the age of 18 increased from\n30.4 percent in 1960 to 71.4 percent in 1996 (9). According to the\nEconomic Policy Institute of Washington, D.C., families worked 247\nmore hours--the equivalent of six more weeks a year--in 1996 than\nthey did in 1989 (10). Also, in 1989, they worked nine more weeks a\nyear than in 1979. Some analysts suggest that there just aren't that\nmany more hours families can give to work (11). According to\nsurveys and opinion polls taken in 1995 and 1996, 42 percent of\nworkers feel \"used up\" by the end of the workday. Between regular\nwork time, overtime, commuting, chores, and attending to children,\nthe average worker in a dual-earner household with children puts in\n14.8 hours per day (9).\nTransit agencies must ensure that they are aware of the stressful\nconditions under which bus operators in particular work. Some of the\nconditions that make bus driving difficult seem to have become\nworse in recent years. Transit managers now talk about what to do\nwith \"toxic passengers\" those that cause difficulties for bus operators\nand passengers alike. The 1998 shooting and murder of a bus\noperator by a deranged passenger in Seattle, Washington, in which\nthe bus ultimately plunged from a bridge (injuring 30 passengers and\nkilling 1), represents the type of incident bus operators fear could\nhappen to them at any time. In addition, congestion on our nation's\nhighways continues to get worse. According to the Texas\nTransportation Institute, the amount of severe congestion in all of the\n70 urban areas they review each year has more than doubled (from\n16 percent to 35 percent) between 1982 and 1996 (12). These\nconditions often cause bus operators to have that much more\ndifficulty with keeping on schedule and keeping passengers content.\nBus operators experience increasing tension as they try to balance\ntheir desire to\nprovide good customer service with the unrelenting pressure to\nremain on schedule (1).\nTransit agencies need to address these challenges in an industry\nin which unions and managers alike often resist changing practices\nthat have been in place for many decades. Addressing the issues of\nemployee availability must be done in a work environment where\ntrust is often lacking between labor and management. Controls on the\nuse of sick leave must be negotiated. There also appears to be a\ndisagreement between transit management and labor on the\nfundamental purpose of sick leave. Managers tend to believe that\nsick leave is provided by the agency as insurance against occurrences\nof legitimate illness and injury. It is a privilege extended by the\nagency, not an entitlement of the employee. Labor tends to believe\nthat sick leave is a benefit that has been negotiated, with costs of the\nuse of such benefits figured into an agency's budget. They believe it\nis time to be used as needed, the use of which is not to be dictated by\nmanagement.\nTransit agencies must take effective actions in the midst of\nthese challenging circumstances to ensure employee availability.\nThese actions include practices related to employee selection,\ninternal motivation of employees, labor-management cooperation,\nsupervisory involvement, incentive and discipline programs, and\nworkers compensation programs.\nSYNTHESIS METHODS AND ORGANIZATION\nFour methods were employed to assemble information for this\nsynthesis:\n1.\nLiterature and research review,\n2.\nSurvey questionnaire (including extensive telephone\nfollow-up),\n3.\nField interviews and site visits, and\n4.\nFocus group meetings with bus operators.\nMembers of the Project Panel for this synthesis report contributed\nbeneficial insights and experiences, many of which are reflected in\nthe development of the survey and the report.\nAn 80-item questionnaire was mailed to 50 transit agencies\nthroughout the United States. Thirty-six responses were returned for\na 72 percent response rate. Those agencies that responded to the\nquestionnaire represent a cross section of mostly mid-sized and large\ntransit agencies from all geographic sectors of the country. The\nquestionnaire appears in Appendix A. Responding agencies are listed\nin Appendix B, and their geographic location is indicated on a map\nof the United States in Appendix C.\n\nChapter 2 reviews the causes of absenteeism from the points of\nview of transit managers and bus operators. The findings included in\nthis chapter were derived from the questionnaire, as well as from\nfocus groups that were conducted with 57 bus operators from a large\ntransit agency concerned about its high level of absenteeism. These\nfindings provide a powerful reminder of the need to understand the\ndifficulties bus operators experience that can lead to unscheduled\nabsences.\nChapter 3 reviews the strategies transit agencies currently use\nto maximize employee availability, including:\n1.\nPreventive measures (ways to prevent absences from\noccurring):\n-\nUtilizing customized selection instruments to assess new\napplicants,\n-\nEnhancing employees' health through wellness programs\nand ergonomic equipment,\n-\nAssisting with off-the-job needs such as day care for\nchildren and elderly parents,\n-\nProviding various forms of incentives and awards to\nencourage excellent attendance, and\n-\nProviding more flexibility in the use of leave time to take\ncare of personal needs.\n2.\nManagement controls (actions taken to control excessive\nabsenteeism):\n-\nRequirements to accrue a certain level of sick leave\nbefore sick leave is paid,\n-\nDenial of pay for the first day of sick leave after a certain\nnumber of sick leave occurrences,\n-\nRequiring documentation and auditing the authenticity of\nmedical certificates,\n-\nMethods for addressing pattern absences,\n-\nProgressive discipline, and\n-\nManaging back to work programs.\n3.\nManagement interventions:\n-\nGroup supervision programs for bus operators,\n-\nTotal quality management programs,\n-\nPositive discipline,\n-\nCommunicating the importance of good attendance, and\n-\nModifying agency procedures to facilitate the attraction\nand hiring of new employees.\nChapter 4 provides conclusions and recommendations for\nfurther research.\n\nCHAPTER TWO\nABSENTEEISM FROM THE POINTS OF VIEW OF TRANSIT MANAGEMENT AND LABOR\nThe survey questionnaire for this project asked the following\nquestion: \"What do you think are the primary causes of absenteeism\nin your agency?\" Managers from 36 agencies offered 18 different\ncauses of absenteeism as shown in Figure 3.\nA more careful review of this list reveals that many of the\n\"causes\" of absenteeism cited by the transit agencies are not causes,\nper se. For instance, stretching weekends or abusing FMLA and\nworkers compensation are not causes of absenteeism, they are\nmanifestations. The question that needs to be answered is why do\nemployees do these things? Do they lack a responsible work ethic?\nDo they basically dislike the responsibilities of being a bus or train\noperator? Are they ill-suited for their job? Do they dislike their\nsupervisor or the agency for which they work? Are their working\nconditions so unfavorable that they need to take \"mental health\ndays?\" Do they have other physical, mental, or emotional problems\nthat cause them to not perform well in their jobs? These questions are\nparticularly important to ponder because, by one estimate, nationally,\nonly 28 percent of sick days are taken because of actual illness (9).\nGood attendance is extremely important to transit agencies, yet\nthey are plagued with substantially higher-than-average rates of\nabsenteeism (1). When policy and\npractice seem to clash, the reasons often can be understood by\nobserving the points of their intended intersection. For that reason, an\naccount of absenteeism from the perspectives of bus operators can\nadd an important voice to the discussion. Recognizing the value of\nthe operators' experience frankly discussed, one large transit agency,\nworking together with the union, hired a professional research firm\nexperienced in conducting focus groups with employees in both\npublic and private agencies.\nDuring the last week of September and the first week of\nOctober 1998, six different focus groups were conducted with bus\noperators at this transit agency. Three of the focus groups were \"self\nselected\" (i.e., operators signed up to be a part of a focus group when\nthey learned of the opportunity to participate). Three of the focus\ngroups were recruited groups, whose members were selected at\nrandom by the research firm. All employees were paid to attend. The\n57 bus operators in attendance included a representative cross section\nof the agency's employees in terms of age, seniority, race, and\ngender. The age of operators in attendance ranged from 22 to 65 and\nyears of seniority ranged from 1 to 32, with an average of 11 years of\nservice. Forty-two operators were male and 15 were female. Fifty\noperators worked full-time and seven part-time. Thirty-one operators\nwere African-American, 24 were Hispanic, and 2 were non-Hispanic\nwhite (13).\nFIGURE 3 Primary causes of absenteeism as identified by transit agencies.\n\nEach focus group lasted 2 hours, with an average of 10 bus\noperators per group. At each meeting, the facilitator explained that\nthe purpose of the session was to gain their insights into the causes of\nabsenteeism at the transit agency. One focus group knew in advance\nthat management would observe them. The remaining five were told\nthat no one from management would be watching or listening. The\noperators in attendance were also assured that, although their input\nwould be reported, no names would be associated with any\ncomments and no tape recordings were to be made of the\nproceedings. Either the principle investigator for this synthesis or a\nproject assistant participated in all of the focus groups.\nThis chapter summarizes the input that bus operators provided\nduring those sessions, which was remarkably similar across all\ngroups, even though operators came from three different operating\nfacilities. One session was for employees who preferred to speak in\nSpanish. The focus group facilitator encouraged the operators to\nspeak to the things about their job that might cause them to use sick\nleave when they weren't really sick. The bus operators seemed\nwilling to express their true feelings and opinions. The input received\nshould prove enlightening for any transit official interested in\nreducing absenteeism.\nBUS OPERATORS' BACKGROUNDS\nEach operator was asked to say how long he or she had worked at the\nagency and why they chose to work there. Although the operators\nhad a variety of work experiences, the most frequently cited former\noccupations were school bus driving, truck driving, security services,\nand construction. Only 6 of the 57 participants were college\ngraduates. When asked why they joined the transit agency, the\noverwhelming majority stated that they came for better pay and\nbetter benefits. Those who worked in construction noted that driving\na bus offered steady work.\nFewer than 10 percent of the operators stated that they joined\nthe agency because they expected to like being bus operators. A very\nfew stated that they thought they would like to work with the public,\nand a couple of operators said they didn't want to be confined to an\noffice. However, it was clear there was nothing intrinsic about the\nnature of the work a bus operator does that drew many of them to\njoin the agency.\nSCHEDULES\nNumerous bus operators stated that they occasionally needed to take\ntime off due to the stress of the job. One of the most frequently cited\nreasons for stress was a tight bus route schedule. Operators stated\nthat, in some cases, the\nschedules were 10 years behind the times. Traffic congestion had\nincreased tremendously, but bus route schedules had not been\nadjusted in accordance with these conditions. Passengers in\nwheelchairs take far more time to board and are using transit more,\nparticularly since they are being encouraged to use fixed-route transit\nversus paratransit. A multitude of passes and fare media makes fare\nenforcement more time consuming, and bike racks add more pressure\nto completing a route on time. Some operators added that most other\ndrivers on the road are not sympathetic to a bus when it is trying to\nreenter traffic from a bus pullout, and that this also contributes to\nbuses running late.\nOperators feel pressure to accomplish their primary mission of\nproviding reliable, timely transit service; however, above all, they\nmust provide safe service, and they find that they must drive unsafely\nif they are to maintain what they regard as unrealistic schedules.\nEven greater pressure comes from passengers who get tense over\nmissing connections, getting to work late, etc. Passengers tend to let\nthe drivers know their displeasure, even though the operators have\ndone everything within their power (and may have even taken some\nrisks) to stay on schedule. Operators know full well that speeding\ntickets could result in lost jobs.\nTight schedules can also consume recovery time for operators\nat the end of routes. They often have no time to use restrooms or take\njust a short breather from their work. Two operators recounted times\nwhen they had to urinate into a cup while inside the bus, because\nthey had no time to relieve themselves at the layover point. In the\nopinion of one operator, \"Management doesn't care about these\nneeds. They treat us as if we aren't humans.\"\nOther operators noted that the lack of time for breaks at layover\npoints also contributed to poor eating habits. With only a few\nminutes to eat, they down conveniently available junk food rather\nthan more nutritious meals. One operator noted she had gone from a\nsize 6 to a size 14 during her time as a bus operator and blamed most\nof that on a work schedule that doesn't provide for decent breaks for\nreasonable food.\nTight schedules were clearly of paramount concern to the vast\nmajority of bus operators. As one stated, \"There's only one good\nroute--the one I take to go home when I'm done.\"\nEQUIPMENT AND FACILITIES\nBus operators do not shape or control the environment in which they\nwork. Their workplace is a rolling machine that is maintained by\nsomeone else and subject to deterioration in\n\nany number of ways. Good driver's seats are critical to bus operator\ncomfort, yet many operators noted that they have \"rocking chair\nseats\" that require repair or replacement, Operators were all the more\nfrustrated having to sit in such seats even after reporting the problem\nmany times. In some cases, radios were inoperative, giving bus\noperators an even greater sense of isolation as they drove their routes.\nAir conditioning was too often inadequate to cool the entire coach\ncomfortably, resulting in passenger discomfort as well. As with tight\nschedules, bus operators take the brunt of passenger complaints about\ninadequate bus conditions.\nBuses that break down in service cause greater inconvenience\nfor passengers and even more headaches for bus operators. The\noperator of a bus following a broken down bus must take the\ncomplaints from passengers who had been waiting for the lead bus\nthat never showed up. Buses that get repaired must often \"deadhead\"\npast waiting passengers to get back on schedule. Operators know\nthey will be facing unhappy passengers the next day, which has\ncaused some to call in sick the next day.\nAs noted earlier, bus operators cited problems with accessing\nrestrooms. On some routes there ware no restroom facilities at the\nlayover point, whereas in other cases the restrooms were too far away\nfor the operator to get to them and back in a reasonable time. This\nposed a particular problem for female bus operators. Two operators\nrecounted times when they had to stop the bus in the middle of a\nroute near a fast food restaurant to use the restrooms. Some\npassengers, concerned with making their connections with\nintersecting buses, took exception to the operator doing this, which\nresulted in extremely unpleasant remarks being made to the bus\noperator.\nOperators also noted that a quiet room that used to be available\nto operators who were in between pieces of work had been converted\nto more office space for other agency functions. This quiet room had\nbeen an important place for those operators who preferred to be out\nof the general din that exists in an operator's preparation room.\nSECURITY AND PASSENGERS\nNumerous operators reported being cursed at, threatened, and\nslapped, Other reported having been spit on, hit with objects such as\numbrellas, and shot at with BB guns. All bus operators were aware\nof far more serious incidents, including a stabbing and serious\nbeatings. More than 30 assaults on bus operators and occurred within\nthe past year. All operators knew such things happened and that it\ncould very well happen to them. One operator asked, \"Do you know\nwhat it's like going to work everyday worried about your well-being,\nyour safety, maybe your life?\"\nThe clear majority of operators agreed that over the years the\ncharacter of bus passengers has changed for the worse. Passengers\nare more likely to snap at bus operators over any disagreement or\nmisunderstanding. Operators stated that there are more people using\ndrugs, more homeless people, more people who used to be in\ninstitutions, and more people carrying weapons. As one operator\nstated, \"Each time you open that door, you don't know what will\ncome through.\" Some passengers feel they have leverage over a bus\noperator by threatening to call transit supervisors with complaints.\nOne operator recalled an incident where a passenger, trying to board\nwith an invalid transfer, said he would call in a complaint if the\ndriver refused his transfer. After the operator suggested he do so,\nbecause he was enforcing the rules as part of his job, the passenger\nsaid, \"You're not going to like this complaint. I'm going to say that\nyou cursed me, threatened me, and drove recklessly.\"\nThe operators noted how difficult school students could be on\ncertain routes. Some students hit the \"Stop Requested\" bar with no\nintent of disembarking. Others pull the emergency switch as a prank.\nThe operators believed that routes that carry lots of students need\nmore under-cover police.\nSome routes are particularly unattractive because they serve\nhigh crime areas where assaults on bus operators are more frequent.\nBus operators assigned to such a route will often call in sick. One\noperator related that he took 2 days sick leave after driving on a\nparticularly dangerous route because of the stress and tension he felt.\nA considerable amount of sick time is used on Halloween because of\nincidents of abuse, such as having rocks, eggs, and even a bucket of\nurine thrown at operators.\nPERSONAL NEEDS/INFLEXIBLE RULES\nThe majority of the operators in these sessions admitted they booked\nsick when they really weren't as their only way of attending to\ncertain personal responsibilities. Because of operator shortages, the\nagency offered no opportunities for drivers to swap days off, and\nonly rarely granted the use of annual leave on a daily basis without\nan advance request. Operators have had to call in sick to attend\nteachers' conferences, the graduation of a son or daughter, the birth\nof a child, the funeral of a close friend, because a regular baby-sitter\nwas not available, or because a car wouldn't start. Operators also\nnoted how time sensitive their jobs were, If they were even a second\nlate for report, they would lose their run and be credited with a \"late\nreport\" on their attendance record. Although they understood the\nneed for the requirement in an agency that runs on a schedule, they\nnoted that life is not always predictable, especially for those with\nchildren. A number of operators noted how helpful a day care center\nat the operating facility\n\nwould be. Unexpected things can happen to the best-prepared\nemployee. Some would call in sick rather than lose their run and be\nsubject to a late report.\nOTHER BUS OPERATORS\nMost operators in the focus groups acknowledged there were abusers\nof sick leave among their ranks, which contributed to excessive\nabsenteeism in the agency. The attendance policies were quite lax,\nand a number of operators took full advantage of this laxness. The\noperators did not offer a definition of \"sick leave abuse\" nor did they\nhave firm ideas on what should be done about people who abuse sick\nleave. There was general agreement that unusual levels of\nabsenteeism occur on paydays and Mondays. Many said they knew\noperators who use their sick days as soon as they are accrued. They\nalso knew of an operator who hadn't worked a Thursday in 14\nmonths (his regular days off were Tuesday and Wednesday.) This\ntype of attendance pattern makes it more difficult for legitimate\nrequests for annual leave to be granted on a daily basis.\nSome operators acknowledged that there were other operators\nwho would shut down a bus to take a break when they wanted one.\nAlthough some operators said they understood that sometimes this\nhappens because of stress, they also noted that several operators just\ndon't have a good work ethic. An operator who puts a bus down\nintentionally creates stress for the bus operator behind him, who will\nneed to pick up all the waiting passengers that are now late. Again,\nthe bus operator doing his job properly will catch the flack of\nunhappy passengers who believe he is running late. Some operators\nacknowledged that they have called in sick when they knew they\nwere going to be behind an operator with a reputation of putting a\nbus down. Operators also acknowledged that they know of fellow\noperators who abused their break time at certain layover points. That\nkind of behavior makes passengers upset at the transit system, and\neven drivers who do their jobs perfectly will face passengers who are\nupset over the actions of another driver. Operators also noted that\nsome operators simply do not enforce agency rules dealing with fares\nand transfers. This makes conditions worse for operators who do try\nto enforce the rules, because it appears that favoritism is being\nextended to some passengers.\nINSUFFICIENT COMMUNICATION/\nNONSUPPORTIVE SUPERVISION\nOne of the most powerful points made in every focus group was that\noperators felt there was a lack of support from management. For\nexample, operators are told to enforce the fare policy and not allow\nanyone to board with an invalid transfer. However, field supervisors\ndon't always\nsupport them when a passenger complains. Operators are told to give\nthe passenger the benefit of the doubt; however, if a spotter was\nriding the bus and noticed the driver allowing the passenger to board\nwith an invalid transfer, drivers believe they would be \"written up.\"\nThe operators expressed the need for a consistent policy and for more\nsupervisors who would enforce that policy.\nWhen passengers file complaints, bus operators also believe\nthat they are \"presumed guilty until proven innocent.\" Although\nevery complaint has two sides, some operators believe that transit\nmanagers already have their minds made up before they hear the\noperator's side of the story. Some operators stated that they feel they\nare \"the enemy within the agency.\"\nMany participants noted that bus operators who become\nsupervisors let it \"go to their heads\" and don't communicate well with\ntheir former associates. One operator wished for a simple friendly\ngreeting on the bus radio system, a \"Good Morning\" or \"Thank you\nfor being here today.\" Instead, the message is more likely to be an\norder, such as \"Make your announcements of stops in accordance\nwith the ADA.\" Another operator suggested building comradery by\ngiving the operators a quick debriefing before they started their day.\nThe operators claimed that they rarely hear from supervisors or\nmanagers. They feel there is little or no follow-up to their\nsuggestions. Bulletin boards are cluttered and not helpful in terms of\nhighlighting truly important information. They believe managers\nhave no idea what is really happening in the field. One operator told\nof a situation where she had been physically threatened and, although\nshe felt traumatized, no one was sent to replace her for over an hour.\nAnother operator could not forget an incident when a passenger spit\nin his face; a supervisor and a police officer witnessed the event but\ndid not react. Such events drain morale, as evidenced in one\noperator's statement, \"If they don't care about me, I don't care about\nthem.\" This same attitude was echoed by several bus operators who\nhad long since become fed up with buses that broke down, tight\nschedules, the lack of accessible restrooms, insufficient support, and\nlittle communication. As one operator advised, \"If you show me you\ncare a little about me, I'll bend over backward for you.\" Most\noperators in attendance firmly believed that transit managers were\nout of touch with a bus operator's needs and that they really didn't\ncare. They felt there was a double standard for managers who had no\ntrouble getting time off to see their child's graduation, or to attend a\nfriend's funeral. Consequently, when the operators need time off for\npersonal needs, they admit to calling in sick. As one operator stated,\n\"When you get upset at the agency, you say the hell with it. I got two\nsick days; I'll take them. Now I'm giving you the stress.\"\n\nThere are many strategies transit agencies need to utilize to\nhighlight the strategies transit agencies are using in an attempt to\naddress the problems associated with absenteeism, particularly\nminimize absenteeism and ensure employee availability.\namong bus operators. The next chapter will\n\nCHAPTER THREE\nSTRATEGIES USED BY TRANSIT AGENCIES TO MAXIMIZE EMPLOYEE AVAILABILITY\nThere are many factors that can contribute to transit agencies having\nproblems with employee availability. Chapters 1 and 2 documented\nmany of the factors: tight labor markets, legitimate illnesses or on-\nthe-job injuries, family responsibilities, employees who either have\npoor work attitudes or are not well suited to a customer relations job,\nlax attendance policies, the lack of flexibility for taking time off,\ndifficult/stressful working conditions, and employees' sense of\nalienation and unimportance. Given the variety of contributing\nfactors, transit agencies have had to adopt a number of different\nstrategies to enhance employee availability. This chapter places each\nof these strategies into one of three categories: preventive measures\ndesigned to prevent absence before it occurs, management controls\non the use of sick leave that deal primarily with the monitoring of\nattendance and to applying discipline after unscheduled absences,\nand other management interventions worthy of discussion that don't\nfit neatly into either of the first two categories.\nPREVENTIVE MEASURES\nTransit agencies are taking a number of proactive steps to help\nprevent absences from occurring. Most of these steps address the\nprimary causes of absenteeism and include the following:\n-\nHiring practices\n-\nHealth maintenance\n-\nAddressing off-the-job employee needs\n-\nProviding incentives to come to work\n-\nProviding employees with more flexible schedules.\nThere are many different techniques within these categories that are\nbeing used in the industry. The extent to which they are being used is\ndescribed here in more detail.\nHiring Practices\nAlthough it has always been important to do as thorough a job as\npossible when reviewing a candidates' skills, character, and work\nbackground, there are factors prevalent today that make the employee\nselection process even more challenging and important. First, many\nagencies note that very low unemployment in their regions has\nresulted in \"employee markets,\" where competition for qualified\nworkers is intense. Many transit agencies acknowledge\nthat it is more difficult to attract the higher caliber candidates,\nespecially given transit's seniority system and how it results in new\nemployees getting the least attractive shifts and often no benefits (for\npart-timers or employees on probation). Second, previous employers\nare becoming more reluctant to provide full information on the work\nrecord of past employees for fear of being sued. Third, the majority\nof transit systems note that many members of the new generation of\nemployees have a distinctly different attitude toward work and\nemployer loyalty. Fourth, the \"lack of work ethic\" or \"laziness\"\namong employees was the third leading cause of absenteeism\naccording to transit agencies surveyed for this report (see Figure 3).\nBus operators who took part in the focus groups described in chapter\n2 further confirmed this as a contributing factor to absenteeism.\nEmployee Selection Instruments\nThe four preceding factors suggest that customized selection\ninstruments may be increasingly valuable as tools for matching\napplicants' aptitudes with the requirements of the job. On average,\nthose agencies that reported using such customized selection\ninstruments rated \"absenteeism as a problem\" as 6.06 on a scale of 1\nto 10 (Figure 2), whereas those that did not use customized selection\ninstruments rated \"absenteeism as a problem\" at 7.05.\nThere are many testing instruments that transit agencies can use\nto help develop a job candidate profile. Of the 36 agencies surveyed,\n16 use customized selection instruments to help determine which\ncandidates they will select. Six of the surveyed agencies use the Bus\nOperator Selection Survey (B.O.S.S.). The B.O.S.S. uses a 77-item\nsurvey, designed under a grant from the American Public Transit\nAssociation, as an initial screening tool for the selection of bus\noperators. This survey takes approximately 30 minutes to complete\nand asks questions that help a transit agency determine the applicants'\nattitudes toward safety, attendance, and customer service. To a lesser\ndegree, temperament, social involvement, timeliness, and self-\nconfidence are also assessed. The B.O.S.S. was validated on more\nthan 800 bus operators across the country using a classic, concurrent,\ncriterion-related study designed to determine if incumbent bus\noperators who scored well on the test also had good attendance\nrecords. The validity test demonstrated that incumbent bus operators\nwho scored higher on the attendance biodata predictor\n\ntended to be absent less for any reason, used fewer days of worker's\ncompensation, and were late less often (3).\nThe test places applicants into one of five categories, with those\nin Category One being the most desirable to hire. Those who are\npredicted to have strong attendance and acceptable safety records are\nin Category Two. Those who are predicted to have strong safety\nrecords and acceptable attendance are in Category Three. Those who\nare predicted to have acceptable safety and attendance records are in\nCategory Four, but characterized as potentially poor risks. Those in\nCategory Five are considered to have a low probability of success\nand are not hired (14). Twenty-six transit agencies from across the\ncountry have tested over 15,300 candidates using the B.O.S.S.\nHowever, very few have conducted systematic analyses of the\nperformance of bus operators hired after taking the B.O.S.S. One\nsuch agency that has performed such an analysis is New Jersey\nTransit. At New Jersey Transit, 73.1 percent of those bus operators\nwho scored best on the B.O.S.S. test and were in the highest\nclassification (Category One) had zero sick days in their first year,\ncompared to 46.67 percent with zero sick days for those selected\nfrom Category Three. Overall, among all the bus operators selected\nthrough the B.O.S.S. instrument at New Jersey Transit, 75 percent\nhad one or no sick days and 93 percent had fewer than five sick days\nin their first year (15). New York City Transit reported that the\ndropout rate among bus operator trainees has decreased 11 percent\nand that student accidents have decreased 30% since they began\nusing the B.O.S.S. to help select their new bus operators (15).\nCitifare (the transit agency for the Regional Transportation\nCommission in Washoe County, Nevada) has also determined that\nemployees who scored well on the B.O.S.S. test have had better\nattendance records than those with lower scores. Hence, there are\npreliminary indications that there is a correlation between high\nB.O.S.S. test scores and good attendance, although the remaining\nagencies have indicated that they have not yet done evaluations. No\nagency that has begun using the B.O.S.S. expressed disappointment.\nEven those without sufficient experience to evaluate its effectiveness\nhave a positive feeling about it. One states that their agency is\n\"noticing a difference,\" another felt \"they were better off with it than\nwithout it,\" whereas another expressed great satisfaction with the\nnature of the questions on the tests.\nNot all transit agencies that have considered using the B.O.S.S.\nprogram have adopted it. A transit agency in Southern California\ndecided against purchasing the B.O.S.S. based on its belief that it\nwasn't well suited to their diverse pool of candidates. The agency\nbelieved that the life experiences of many Vietnamese candidates\ndidn't correlate well with the nature of many of the questions, and the\nlanguage skills of the applicants proved to be a barrier to easy\ncompletion of the test. An agency in the\nstate of Washington felt the cost of the B.O.S.S. testing service was\ntoo high, particularly for small and medium-sized transit agencies.\nThis agency also expressed concern that reliance on the test to select\ncandidates might subject them to Equal Employment Opportunity-\nrelated challenges from applicants in their community. Agencies\ninterested in knowing more about this issue might wish to consult the\nUniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures as adopted\nby the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.\nCitifare stands out among transit agencies because it uses four\ndifferent tests (explained later) to help select bus operator candidates:\nthe B.O.S.S.; the Driver Risk Index Video Test; the REID Report;\nand Seattle Metro's \"Working with the Public\" Video Test. At\nCitifare, unscheduled absences average 10 days per year\n(considerably better than the average of 16.07 days of unscheduled\nabsence of all transit agencies surveyed for this report), and\nattendance performance has stayed about the same over the past 5\nyears. Citifare believes that the use of multiple tests is beneficial,\nbecause they focus primarily on different areas. For instance,\ncandidates might be particularly strong in safety, but they might\nexhibit very weak attitudes in attendance. Hence, they believe that\nthe thorough review of candidates using different testing instruments\nultimately benefits the agency by allowing them to select the very\nbest candidates, as validated by multiple selection instruments. Each\ntest acts as a sieve that helps the agency sort out the best candidates.\nThe Driver Risk Index used by Citifare is an evaluation\ninstrument designed to measure the driver's traffic risk recognition\nand control skills. According to Dr. Jack Weaver of Advanced\nDriving Skills Institute of Clearwater, Florida, it is an instrument\nused by a number of public and private agencies involved in the\ntransportation of goods or passengers (16). It takes about 45 minutes\nto complete and consists of 50 video vignettes showing traffic\nsituations from the vantage point of the driver. The applicants are\nasked to agree or disagree with the commentator's comments about\nthe scenario. A correct answer receives a score of one, while all other\nanswers receive a score of zero. Citifare believes it helps to predict\nthe ability of the applicant to drive defensively (14). The more safely\nan operator drives, the less likely they are to have accidents that\nmight cause them to miss work due to injury.\nThe REID Report is produced by Reid Psychological Systems\nof Chicago, Illinois. Reid Psychological Systems has developed\nnumerous employment testing programs to help identify critical\ninformation about job applicants that is difficult to find solely\nthrough interviews and resumes (17). The test used by Citifare\nconsists of three parts that take approximately 1 hour to complete.\nThe first part is an integrity attitude scale with 83 questions that test\nthe\n\ncandidate's trustworthiness and productivity. The second part is a\nsocial behavior questionnaire with 73 questions designed to uncover\nan applicant's experiences at work and elsewhere. The third part has\n46 questions designed to determine safety attitudes and recent drug\nuse. Each section results in the candidate being placed in one of three\ncategories: \"Recommended,\" \"Qualified Recommended,\" and \"Not\nRecommended.\" Citifare's Transit Manager Michael Steele states \"It\nis amazing how many people taking these tests will admit they've\nstolen something, or hang around with people who use drugs, or have\nhad a shouting match with their supervisor.\" Citifare managers\nbelieve that candidates who are more honest and score well on the\nintegrity test are less likely to call in sick when they really aren't.\nThey also believe that drug use can lead to unnecessary absences\nfrom work. At Citifare, candidates whose scores result in a \"Not\nRecommended\" evaluation are not hired.\nAnother candidate screening tool is the Seattle Metro's\n\"Working with the Public\" Video Test. First developed in 1979 by\nthe Seattle Metro transit agency, the test consists of 65 video\nvignettes showing typical scenarios that a coach operator faces. In\neach vignette, a critical incident is dramatized, with the action\nstopping at the point where the operator would need to make a\njudgment concerning the situations. Four possible choices are then\npresented to the candidate. The correct answer solves the problem in\nthe most effective, courteous manner. Other answers are weighted in\nterms of their effectiveness in resolving the problems. The manner in\nwhich the candidate \"handles\" the situation demonstrates the quality\nof the driver's human relation skills (18).\nAs described by the bus operators who participated in the focus\ngroups reported on in chapter 2, stressful incidents with passengers\ncan have a major effect on a bus operator's attitude and ability to\nwork. Those with a greater ability to let unimportant things go and\nwho remain calm when provoked will have a greater tolerance for the\ntension that a bus operator will experience. This in turn can affect a\nbus operator's attendance record and availability to the transit agency.\nThe Seattle Metro Video Test has been used by more than 65\ntransit agencies in the United States. Based on surveys of 54 transit\nagencies in 1993, 73 percent agreed that the video test improved the\nquality of new hires and that the public relations skills of applicants\nwould be difficult to know without it (18). More than 80 percent saw\nimprovements in areas that would be expected to be directly effected\nby improved judgment in working with people. The impact on\nturnover and sick leave was not as great, but still important (40-50\npercent noted improvements). One respondent to this synthesis\nreport's survey recently abandoned the Seattle Metro Video Test\nclaiming insufficient correlation between performance and test\nresults. Two other agencies use a test very similar to the Seattle test\n(customized a bit for their local circumstances) and are quite pleased\nwith its predictive capabilities. Pierce Transit in Tacoma,\nWashington, reported that the transit agencies in the state of\nWashington formed a consortium to help pay for the updating of the\nSeattle Metro Test. ERGOMETRICS, a private firm in Seattle, is\nnow marketing the new video tests entitled \"START People Sense\"\nand \"START Driving.\" The updated subject matter includes customer\nrelations, relations with supervisors and co-workers, and working\nwith a diverse customer base including teenagers and paratransit\ncustomers (19).\nConducting Thorough Reference Checks\nVirtually all employers want the work history of a potential\nemployee. Hence, it was mildly surprising to learn that only 23 of the\n36 transit agencies surveyed indicated that they conducted a thorough\nreference check of each applicant's record of attendance in prior\npositions. The most likely cause for this, which was noted by a few\nagencies, is that previous employers are reluctant to offer specific\ninformation on past employees, fearing potential lawsuits. (This\nmight not prevent a transit agency from obtaining information on\napplicants' attendance records if their previous employers were\npublic agencies. The California Public Records Act allows\nprospective employers to review all but the most sensitive work\nrecords of a public employee, such as medical or police records,\nwhich might constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.)\nInformation gained from references is more suspect, which results in\nagencies not being able to complete thorough analyses of past\nattendance records. In the absence of detailed attendance\ninformation, Houston Metro in Harris County, Texas, noted that it\nexamines an applicants' entire work history to get a sense of their\nemployment stability. If a pattern of employment stability is lacking,\nthey do not offer the candidate the job. Most transit agencies conduct\nextensive screening, including criminal background and driving\nrecord checks. The Tri-County Metropolitan Transportation District\nof Oregon (Tri-Met) in Portland, Oregon, reports that they do not\naccept applications unless there are at least three references listed.\nThey also require applicants to perform \"work demonstration tests\"\nin which candidates must perform certain movements that\ndemonstrate their capability to perform the types of movements they\nwill be required to do on the job (such as reaching, assisting people\nin wheelchairs, etc.).\nRequiring New Employees to Attest That\nThey Understand Attendance Policies\nTransit agencies generally advise new employees of agency policies\n(including attendance policies) during\n\ntheir orientation or initial training. However, only 19 of the 36 transit\nsystems have adopted the practice of having employees formally\nattest, in writing, that they have read, understand, and agree to abide\nby the agency's attendance policies. Some agencies commented that\nsuch a technique has no impact on employee behavior, particularly\nwith the FMLA in effect. This technique is regarded as a \"reinforcer\"\nby those who use it, one that helps highlight the significance of\nattendance, and is just a small part of the agencies' comprehensive\napproach to preventing and controlling absenteeism.\nPierce Transit attempts to minimize turnover among new\nemployees by being candid with their job applicants about the\ndifficult nature of the relief bus operator job. Each job applicant is\ngiven a three-page report entitled \"The Life of a Relief Transit\nOperator at Pierce Transit\" that they must read and sign prior to\nbeing interviewed (Appendix D). This report describes the relatively\nunattractive aspects of working for an employer whose first shift\nbegins at 3:31 a.m. and whose last shift ends at 1:11 a.m. The report\ndescribes how relief operators have no choice as to which shift they\nwill work or what routes they will drive. The report also describes\nscenarios in which work assignments might be changed with only 1\nhour's notice, and applicants are advised that there is no guarantee of\nwhen they will be promoted to a full-time operator's position. In\nshort, Pierce Transit emphasizes that during the time a new employee\nis a relief bus operator, it will be very difficult for them to schedule\ntheir private lives around what their employer expects of them. The\nagency believes that this candid, realistic report helps to minimize\nturnover they might otherwise experience with newly hired and\ntrained bus operators.\nHealth Maintenance\nTransit agencies would be wise to provide more emphasis on helping\ntheir employees maintain good health. In his 1994 report, \"Working\non the Hot Seat: Urban Bus Operators\" (1), Gary Evans noted that\n\"Urban bus drivers die at a younger age from coronary heart disease,\ntypically retire earlier with physical disabilities and are absent from\nwork at much higher rates for gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal and\nnervous disorders than their contemporaries in numerous other\noccupational groups.\" In other driver-related industries, health\nmaintenance has proven to be a primary concern for managers (20).\nThe academic and trade literature related to truck drivers lists alcohol\nand drug abuse (21--23), fatigue (24--26), back pain (27,28), and\n\"lifestyle hazards\" including food, nutrition, and exercise (29)\nas\nthe primary reasons for health related problems and absence.\nHenrickson suggests that an agency must stress that they operate in\nan organizational culture that does not condone drug and alcohol\nabuse (20,30).\nAlthough this report concerns itself with employee availability,\nthe issue of health care also has substantial impacts on the budgets of\nall employers, including transit agencies. San Diego Transit's Vice-\nPresident of Human Resources, Frank Shipman, reports that health\ncare expenditures at his agency have increased by 10 percent or more\nin each of the past 2 years, following relatively low increases in the\nprevious 5 years. Estimates of health care costs in the United States\nexceeded $600 billion in 1995 (20,31). One forecast is for these costs\nto increase to 15 percent of the gross national product or $15,200 per\nemployee per year by the year 2000 (20,32). Subsequently, transit\nagencies and other public and private employers have taken many\nsteps to address the causes of poor health or injury.\nWellness Programs\nThe vast majority (30 of 36) of transit agencies reported that they\noffer various types of \"Wellness Programs.\" The intent of such\nprograms is to encourage employees to stay healthy and fit, for their\nown benefit and for the benefit of the agency. A particularly popular\nelement of wellness programs is on-site fitness centers (one agency\ncalls them \"fitness factories\") with workout rooms featuring weights\nand other exercise apparatus. Seven agencies reported providing such\nfacilities. Another agency reported that they provide exercise classes\nafter hours for all interested employees.\nMany other agencies reported that a variety of health self-\nimprovement courses are offered, either through their medical\nbenefits program or through the agency's Employee Assistance\nProgram (EAP). Courses are offered that address such subjects as\nsmoking cessation, nutritional education, weight reduction, diabetes\ncontrol, kidney disease prevention, allergies, heart disease, prostate\ncancer, and stress management.\nA few agencies reported having health fairs on site, where\ninformation on available health and fitness services can be obtained.\nAt these fairs, checks on blood pressure, heart rate, cholesterol\ncounts, bone density, body fat, and glucose levels are performed by\nhealth maintenance organization (HMO) providers or nurses from\nlocal hospitals. Other agencies focus on a particular health concern\nby conducting \"heart days,\" \"cancer days,\" or providing flu shots. In\naddition, a clear majority\n(23) of the 36 transit agencies reported they do provide physical\nexams at no cost to employees. One agency reported that they pay for\n\"nicotine patches\" that help some smokers quit. Another agency\nreported success with a program that offered dollars for pounds lost\nin a weight reduction program.\nAt Pierce Transit, a joint labor--management \"Health Express\nCommittee\" has been established to provide opportunities for\nemployees to learn about ways in which\n\nthey can take control of their own health and well-being and to\nencourage them to incorporate this information into their daily\nlifestyle choices (33). This committee has engaged in virtually all of\nthe activities noted above. It is largely self-supporting and conducts a\nnumber of fundraisers throughout the year to raise money for the\npurchase of exercise equipment, incentives, and snacks and supplies\nfor promotional events. These fundraisers also promote healthy life\nstyle choices by serving healthful, low fat meals. Pierce Transit\nsupports this program by providing time for employees to serve on\nthe committee, designating space for exercise facilities and wellness\nevents, assisting with the cost of incentives, subsidizing flu shots,\nand purchasing books and newsletters for the wellness library located\nin the human resources department (34). The Champaign-Urbana\nMass Transit District has a Health and Fitness Committee that is\nengaged in coordinating several events such as basketball\ntournaments, golf outings, softball and football games, and picnics.\nThe committee promotes a healthy, active life-style.\nSome transit agencies (13 of 36) provide discounts for\nemployees who join health clubs or programs offered at places such\nas the YMCA. One transit agency reported that insurance premiums\nare reduced for employees who join fitness programs. One agency\nhas tried to promote discounted health club memberships, but \"didn't\nhave enough takers to put the program in place.\" In spite of that, the\nagency is still trying to establish such a benefit for its employees.\nThere is an undeniable belief that such programs are positive and can\nhelp reduce absenteeism, and that it is a good benefit to offer people\nwho do want to improve themselves. In addition, both Marnie\nSlakey, Human Resources Director for Pierce Transit, and Bill Volk,\nExecutive Director at Champaign-Urbana, report that the work of\ntheir health committees helps to improve general morale at their\nagencies, which they believe helps to minimize absenteeism.\nUnfortunately, no transit system surveyed for this report had\nquantified the benefits of their wellness programs, and there was a\nlack of consensus on the effects of such programs on absenteeism.\nClearly these are programs of a positive nature, but comments\nreceived from transit agencies indicate that the impact of such\nvoluntary programs on overall attendance is more indirect and\ndifficult to judge. One agency believes such \"programs are effective\nfor those people who truly want to make a change in their lifestyle,\nbut have minimal impact on those who really don't care.\" Among\nother comments received were that wellness programs tend to be\nused by highly motivated people who generally exhibit good\nattendance habits with or without such programs. However, there is a\nconsiderable amount of evidence that wellness programs can have\nsignificant effects on attendance and the bottom line performance of\nother employers.\nOther industries have documented the benefits of implementing\nwellness programs. A 4-year study of Control Data Corporation\nemployees gathered statistics on exercise, weight, smoking,\nhypertension, alcohol use, cholesterol, and seat belt use. Results\nindicated that people with hypertension required 25 percent more\nhospital days than nonhypertensive employees; overweight workers\nincurred 11 percent higher costs than workers of normal weight; and\nsmokers of one or more packs a day had medical claim costs 18\npercent higher (20.35). Kansas found that state employees who\nsmoked cigarettes spent 69 percent more time in the hospital than\nnonsmokers (20,36). Birmingham, Alabama, established a wellness\nprogram after its medical costs increased by more than twice the\nnational rate from 1975 to 1983. A study was established in which\n1,100 employees were assigned to control and wellness groups. Both\ngroups received thorough health screenings and a health risk\nappraisal. However, only the wellness group received the benefits of\na health awareness meeting every 2 weeks, a fitness center, programs\non smoking cessation, weight reduction, stress management,\ncholesterol modification, and hypertension control. The results\nshowed fewer employees smoking, fewer workers with cholesterol\nlevels of over 200, and fewer with high blood pressure. Overall\nmedical costs per employee remained virtually the same from 5 years\nearlier. Hospital days per 1,000 employees fell from 926 in 1984 and\n569 in 1985 to 260 each in 1989 and 1990 (37,38).\nThe Adolf Coors Brewing Company in Golden, Colorado, has\nbuilt their wellness programs into the culture of the company. They\nestimate that they save $1.9 million annually in terms of medical\ncosts, reduced sick days, and increased productivity, or $6.15 for\nevery dollar invested (20,39,40). The company has a preventative\nhealth program that includes a comprehensive battery of screening\ntests, an on-site fitness center, cardiac and orthopedic rehabilitation\nfacilities, dental and medical clinics, and mammography and cervical\nscreening programs (41). Wellness center participants miss an\naverage of 2.0 workdays per year because of illness or injuries;\nnonparticipants miss 3.1 days. The company uses a Health Hazard\nAppraisal, detailing personalized information on the chance of\npremature death or disease, to achieve employee (and spouse)\nawareness. Coors' experience identified elements essential for a\nsuccessful wellness program, including support and direction from\nthe chief executive officer, making it a stated priority, hiring or\nsubcontracting with qualified specialists, and establishing a separate\nbudget (20,39,40).\nExercise is a major component of a wellness program. Exercise\nis directly related to weight control and muscle and tendon\nstrengthening. One insurance company study indicated that sick days\ndropped from eight to three for employees who exercised (20). In\nanother study, women\n\nemployees who exercised twice a week incurred $600 a year in\nmedical costs, compared with $1,500 by those who did not exercise.\nThe savings for men were comparable ($561 versus $1,220) (20). In\nthe Boston Police Department, a pilot program was created to\ndetermine the potential impact of a weight loss program. Seventy-\neight members of the department, who were 20 percent over their\nideal weight, attended a 12-week nutrition training program. Two-\nthirds finished the program, reporting an average weight loss of 7.5\npounds per employee. One year later, 49 percent self-reported an\naverage weight loss of 24 pounds (20,42).\nSometimes incentives are used to get people to take part in\nwellness programs. In Glendale, Arizona, 98 percent of the city\nemployees participated in wellness programs, up from 40 percent the\nprevious year. The reason for this was the waiving of the $150\ndeductible for medical insurance. Glendale estimates that it saved\n$10 for every dollar spent by reducing absenteeism and on-the-job\naccidents and through low and infrequent health insurance rate\nincreases (20,43).\nMost studies of employers that have implemented wellness\nprograms report a variety of positive results. Behavioral change can\nbe encouraged by a seven-step wellness intervention that includes:\n(1)\nawareness, (2) education, (3)\nincentives, (4) programs, (5)\nself-action, (6) follow-up, and (7)\nsupport (20). Results are\nalso likely to occur if there is one-to-one outreach by counselors.\nPrograms That Emphasize Safety and\nAccident Prevention\nThirty of 36 transit agencies reported that they do have training\nprograms that emphasize safety and accident prevention. Virtually\nevery transit agency emphasizes safety in the training of new bus\noperators. This is such a standard activity that no transit system\ncommented on any special features. One agency reported that\nrepresentatives of the state's worker's compensation programs have\nworked closely with the transit system to identify safer methods for\naccomplishing various tasks.\nMUNI in San Francisco has had more than its share of assaults\non bus operators in the past few years. The agency has gone to great\nlengths to install digital cameras on buses in high-risk areas to help\ndiscourage attacks on bus operators or passengers. They have also\ninstituted a local program similar to \"Guardian Angels.\" The agency\nhas hired passengers who have previously been the cause of\ndisturbances themselves and given them training in human\ninteraction and dispute resolution. These employees then ride the\nbuses and help to defuse any situations that appear to be potentially\nvolatile. In addition, the agency\nhas identified several operators who have been in a number of\nassaults. Although no one wants to appear to blame the victim, some\noperators have aggressive or defensive approaches, and don't help\ntheir own cause when interacting with certain types of passengers.\nThe agency provides special training on interpersonal skills, and tries\nto emphasize that the operator's attitude and behavior can affect the\nbehavior of the other party.\nErgonomic Equipment or Work Stations\nTwenty-three of 36 transit agencies reported that they have been\nmindful of finding ergonomic equipment for a variety of applications\nthroughout the agency. Ergonomics represents the study of\nequipment design to reduce operator fatigue and discomfort (44).\nExamples of ergonomic solutions reported by surveyed transit\nagencies include specially contoured chairs for those who sit all day\n(such as telephone information personnel); pads, keyboards, and\nwristbands that help prevent or minimize carpal tunnel syndrome;\nadjustable Recaro air-float seats for bus operators; telescoping and\ntilting steering wheels in buses; portable back pillow supports; and\nproperly sized work tables for mechanics to help avoid neck and\nshoulder stress.\nAlso, more attention is being paid to the movements employees\nfrequently make that can result in strained muscles or other injuries.\nFor example, one agency reported on a simple stick with an eraser on\none end that allows operators to change the messages on the\nheadsigns of buses without reaching or stretching unnecessarily.\nAnother cited the inclusion of remote-controlled side-view mirrors\non all buses, which are clearly safer and easier for drivers to adjust.\nAnother agency noted that their risk management staff includes an\nergonomic specialist who helps identify better equipment and offers\ntraining on appropriate ways to use ergonomic equipment.\nPerhaps the greatest attention has been paid to the bus\noperator's workstation. Research has shown that 80.5 percent of bus\noperators have experienced some degree of back and neck pain\ncompared with 50.7 percent of nonoperators, and the incidence of\nreported low back pain is 20 percent higher for operators than for\nnonoperators (45). Frequent awkward postures, muscular effort,\nvibration, and shock, as well as exposure to whole body vibration\nand prolonged sitting in a constrained position, contribute to\noverworking the lumbar spine and its supportive structures, causing\nlow back pain (46). BC Transit of Vancouver, British Columbia, has\ndeveloped standards that are applied to the workstations of all new\nbuses it purchases. These include pneumatic ride seats instead of\nspring suspension seats, tilting and telescoping steering columns,\npower assist steering, left-side convex mirrors, and relocated\nfareboxes. With these modified specifications, bus\n\noperator workstation-related injuries have been reduced by 78\npercent, and there has been an 86 percent reduction in the amount of\ntime off per injury (47,48).\nThe study funded through Transit Cooperative Research\nProgram (TRCP) Report 25 was intended to further the research into\nimproving the workstation of bus operators (47). More than 135\noperators provided input on their major concerns with the\nworkstation. The workstation that was ultimately designed was\nvalidated by using JACK (a CAD-based human simulation software\npackage) and by having a prototype driven by 24 bus operators from\ndifferent transit agencies. All 24 operators rated the prototype better\nthan the standard bus workstation for each of the major design\ncriteria that included:\n-\nAn 18-inch steering wheel,\n-\nA tilt-telescoping steering wheel,\n-\nRemotely activated mirrors,\n-\nA farebox no taller than 36 inches,\n-\nA pin joint suspension driver's seat,\n-\nA seat with air-actuated lumbar and back side bolster\nsupport features,\n-\nA turn signal platform located on the floor angled at 30\ndegrees,\n-\nInstrument panels adjustable for height and divided into\nleft, center, and right,\n-\nAn annunciator system that ideally would allow hands-\nfree communication, and\n-\nA keypad and small display to be the central interface\nwith the bus electronic sy stem.\nA cost-benefit analysis of the recommended workstation was\ndeveloped based on information from Connecticut Transit and BC\nTransit. The conclusion reached was that the additional costs\nassociated with modifying the operator workstation could be\nrecovered through savings in medical costs and worker's\ncompensation costs within 3.7 to 8.1 years. This estimate was\nregarded as conservative and in keeping with the positive results that\nwere observed at BC Transit and at an automobile carpet\nmanufacturing facility that also implemented an ergonomic redesign\nof workstations (46).\nAddressing Off-the-Job Employee Needs\nEmployee attendance can be affected by factors relating to other\nresponsibilities in their lives. The stress of dealing with family\nresponsibilities, marital problems, financial problems, drug or\nalcohol abuse, and a host of other conditions can wear on the best-\nintentioned employee. EAPs are designed to help employees deal\nwith personal issues in a confidential manner. (In fact, one agency\nreported that their local bargaining unit manages an EAP.) Although\nthe immediate benefit is toward the well-being of\nthe employee, transit agencies recognize the benefits as well. They\nrealize that EAPs can help employees with particularly difficult\nproblems get back to work as quickly as possible. Thirty-five of 36\nagencies reported that they offered EAPs. Transit agencies noted that\nbetween 10 and 15 percent of their work force use services offered\nthrough their EAPs each year. EAPs help relieve job-related stress\nand other problems that can negatively affect attendance, at little or\nno cost to the employee. There is consensus on the value of EAPs,\nthough it is difficult to judge its impact on attendance.\nOne-half of all the agencies responding to the survey indicated\nthat they did provide critical stress assistance to employees who have\nbeen through some sort of shock or trauma. Examples might include\nwhen a train operator runs over a person who has decided to commit\nsuicide by jumping in front of the train or after a bus operator has\nbeen assaulted or threatened with a weapon. The significant factor is\nto have the employee see someone who is skilled in dealing with\nsuch trauma as soon as possible. These resources are usually made\navailable through the agency's EAP.\nThe survey also asked if the agency provided child care or elder\ncare. Single parent households are not uncommon, and the norm is\nfor both parents in a two-parent household to work. Parents must\noccasionally respond to their children's needs during work hours.\nDay care might be provided by a friend or family member who might\nnot always be able to perform such duties, causing employees to have\nto scramble for substitutes or miss work altogether. This is becoming\nan increasingly significant factor as the percentage of women within\ntransit agency work forces increases. At Pierce Transit, women now\ncomprise 40 percent of all bus operators. In addition, the \"sandwich\ngeneration\" of employees with children and aging parents might also\nhave responsibilities of caring for elderly parents that could cause\nthem to miss work.\nVIA in San Antonio, Texas, was the only transit agency found\nto provide child day care at their main operating facility, where all\nagency personnel, including bus operators and mechanics, could\navail themselves of the service. The hours of operation are 5:30 a.m.\nto 7:00 p.m., Monday through Friday. When the day care center was\nfirst opened in 1990, the hours were from 5:00 a.m. to 9 p.m., but\nover time, the agency found that those extended hours were not\nnecessary. The center was developed after the agency sought and\nreceived input from employees on their needs. With full support from\ntheir policy board, VIA decided to manage the facility themselves to\nensure the highest degree of control over the quality of child care\nstaff, policies, and procedures. VIA pays highly competitive salaries\nto their professional staff at the center. The enhanced compensation\nscale, which includes VIA benefits and a career\n\nladder, has enabled the center to attract professional teachers\ndedicated to quality care for children and minimize the turnover rate.\nThe center cares for children from birth until the age of seven. The\ntuition fees are as follows:\nFull-time child/grandchild of VIA employee:\nInfants and toddlers\n$75 weekly\nPreschool (2-7)\n$70 weekly\nNieces/nephews:\nInfants and toddlers\n$90 weekly\nPreschool (2-7)\n$80 weekly\nDrop-in:\nAll ages for up to 9 hours\n$20\ndaily All ages hourly\n$ 4 hourly\nThe center currently serves 75 children, all but a few of whom\nare children or grandchildren of the 1,600 VIA employees that work\nat the transit facility. The child development center must be\nsubsidized at a rate of approximately $100,000 per year. No one at\nVIA could say if the center was cost effective in terms of saving at\nleast $100,000 per year through reduced absenteeism. However, the\ncenter has been in operation since 1990 and has proven to be\nextremely popular. Representatives of VIA believe that the day care\ncenter does help reduce absenteeism and makes the agency more\nattractive to job applicants. They believe it has helped the morale of\nthe employees. Parent/employees no longer worry about their\nchildren, and those who are able visit them during breaks. There is no\nthought of discontinuing the service; instead, they are considering\nproviding school age care during the holidays and summer as well as\ncare for sick children.\nSome transit agencies report that they are extremely reluctant to\nplace a child care facility on their property because of liability\nconcerns, such as an infant being dropped or a child falling off a\nswing. VIA officials were aware of the possibility of children being\ninjured while on their property, but did not consider the issue a major\nobstacle. According to Human Resources Director Michael Catalani,\npublic agencies in Texas enjoy tort liability limits of $350,000. The\nagency is self-insured. After 9 years of operation, there have been\nincidents where children at the center have fallen, chipped their teeth,\nscraped their knees, or suffered other relatively minor injuries;\nhowever, VIA has never experienced a lawsuit nor have they had to\nsettle out of court to deal with a child's injury.\nThe Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation\nAuthority (LACMTA) reported providing day care services on site,\nbut only at their administrative headquarters. These services are\navailable to employees with children from 8 weeks of age to pre\nkindergarten. According to LACMTA managers, this program\nimproved attendance, enabling employees to return to work more\nquickly, and improved morale as well among administrative\nemployees.\nThose with children at the day care center could easily check on them\nduring their breaks and in between shifts, whereas other employees\nsimply enjoyed seeing babies and toddlers. However, LACMTA does\nnot have plans for instituting day care centers at any of their\noperating facilities. That agency is currently under severe budget\nstrains, and they don't have operating facilities as large as the 1,600\nemployee facility in San Antonio. They do have an agreement with a\nprivate day care provider that extends a 10 percent discount on day\ncare services to LACMTA's employees in exchange for the agency's\nassistance in promoting the private company by placing brochures\nand posters in LACMTA facilities.\nThe Regional Transit District (RTD) in Denver, Colorado, had\nstudied the possibility of providing a day care facility on site after\nreceiving feedback from employees on the importance of this type of\nservice. The agency subsequently decided against having a facility on\nsite, citing concerns over liability and the potential for grievances.\nHowever, it appears they are going forward with a pilot program that\nwill subsidize two off-site day care centers for a total of $50,000 a\nyear. Employees in need of this service will be able to take advantage\nof reduced rates at these centers, which are located near RTD's\noperating facilities. Initially, the union expressed concern over\nproviding direct subsidies to the employees who use the service. This\nwas believed to be a direct form of compensation that would need to\nbe extended in some other equal fashion to all employees. Although\nthis benefit is being championed by a number of board members at\nRTD, managers are concerned that employees' expectation levels will\nbe raised in ways that the agency will not be able to afford in the\nfuture.\nSun Tran in Tucson, Arizona, reported that their city's new\nparatransit center has added a day care facility, but none of the fixed\nroute bus operators are able to use it because their shifts begin either\ntoo early or too late for the hours the day care center is open.\nHowever, Sun Tran has budgeted grant funds to construct a day care\ncenter in their new fixed route facility.\nNew Jersey Transit offers optional tax sheltered spending\naccounts (flexible spending accounts) for dependent care expenses. A\nhandful of other agencies noted that they provide information on the\nlocation and availability of day care centers nearest employees'\nhomes, but they don't provide financial assistance, nor do they\nassume liability in providing the information.\nProviding Incentives to Come to Work\nIn its most generic form, the incentive payment is any compensation\nthat has been designed to recognize some specific accomplishment\non the employee's part. In general, it\n\nTABLE 1\nDETAILS AND EFFECTIVENESS OF PROGRAMS ALLOWING EMPLOYEES TO CASH IN SICK LEAVE\nUPON RETIREMENT\nTotal Sick Hours\nTotal Sick Hours That\nIs This Effective in\nTransit Agency\nThat May Be\nMay Be Cashed Out at\nAccrued\nRetirement\nReducing Absenteeism?\nMilwaukee County (Wis.)\nSun Tran (Albuquerque, N.Mex.)\nRoaring Fork (Aspen, Colo.)\nSun Tran (Tucson, Ariz.)\nOrange County TA (Calif.)\nSpokane Transit (Wash.)\nAnn Arbor (Mich.)\nBroward County (Fla)\nTri-Met (Portland, Oreg.)\n120 days\n1,200 hours\n400 hours\n600 hours\nUnlimited\n180 days\nUnlimited\nUnlimited\n1,496 hours\n110 days\n96 hours\n133 hours\n300 hours\n160 hours\n80 days after 25 years\nof service\n3 months\n480 hours\n748 hours\nYes\nYes, for some\nYes, for most\nNo (50% is not deemed\nenough)\nNo\nNot much\nFairly effective\nNo\nNot really\nNote: TA = Transportation Authority.\nis hoped that the prospect of the incentive payment will inspire the\ndesired performance (49). In the transit industry, employee\nattendance is easily defined and highly measurable, and consequently\nlends itself to incentive programs. Taxpayers, who ultimately pay for\npublic services, often fail to support incentives if they are perceived\nas a bonus over and above what has to be paid if there is no improved\nservice to show for it. However, other research indicates that public\nanxiety is most likely to arise when significant bonuses are paid to a\nhandful of senior managers. The payment of modest incentives to a\nlarger group of employees has not caused a similar reaction (49).\nDo incentives help reduce absenteeism? Does the opportunity\nto be rewarded with money or time off help prevent absenteeism?\nOne-third of the surveyed transit agencies said no, one-third said yes,\nand one-third offered no comment. A variety of incentives have been\noffered, with very mixed results. These methods are described here in\nmore detail.\nCashing in Sick Leave at Retirement\nA clear majority (25) of the 36 transit agencies allow their employees\nto cash in sick leave at retirement, although the percentage or total\nnumber of hours that can be cashed in varies considerably. Transit\nagencies also differ in the number of hours employees are allowed to\naccrue. The intent of such programs is to encourage employees not to\nuse sick leave by paying them for some of its value upon retirement.\nTable 1 shows samples of the different incentives that are provided.\nThese samples show that the practice of paying for unused sick\nleave upon retirement varies considerably from agency to agency.\nSome agencies don't offer this incentive\nat all. Some pay as much as 880 hours of sick leave upon retirement,\nwhereas others pay as few as 96 hours. One agency requires an\nemployee to work a minimum of 25 years to qualify for this benefit,\nwhereas another requires only 10 years. Some transit agencies have\ncaps on how many total sick hours or days may be accrued, whereas\nothers allow employees to accrue an unlimited amount.\nNo patterns of success emerge from the responses to the survey.\nThe specific provisions of these incentives have been the subject of\nnegotiations between labor and management at each transit agency.\nNo transit agency reported that they have done any true analysis of\nthe effectiveness of this incentive. Some agencies expressed concern\nover allowing employees the right to accrue unlimited amounts of\nsick leave. They report instances of workers approaching retirement\nwho find doctors that recommend the employee not work due to\nstress, soft tissue injury, or some other condition that is difficult to\nconfirm or deny. This allows employees to be paid full time while\nstaying away from work during a substantial portion of their final\nyear. Other long-term employees are reported to take advantage of\nthe time they have accumulated to have surgery on nagging\nconditions while they still have full insurance. They recover while\ngetting paid full wages, and still have enough sick leave in the bank\nto receive lump sum payments upon retirement for the hours they did\nnot use.\nCashing in Sick Leave at the End of the Year\nThirteen of 36 agencies provide employees with the opportunity to\ncash in a certain amount of sick leave at the end of each calendar\nyear. Examples of this are provided in Table 2.\n\nTABLE 2\nDETAILS AND EFFECTIVENESS OF PROGRAMS ALLOWING EMPLOYEES TO CASH IN UNUSED SICK LEAVE AT THE\nEND OF THE YEAR\nTransit Agency\nMinimum Sick Hour\nBalance Required\nAfter Cash Out\nSick Hours That May\nBe Cashed Out at the\nEnd of the Year\nIs it Effective in Reducing\nAbsenteeism?\nSun Tran (Albuquerque, N.

The remaining three-quarters of the sick days\nwere added to the accumulating base. During the period from 1983 to\n1987, Dekalb experienced a reduction of 5.48 days of sick leave used\nper employee. It was estimated that this amounted to a productivity\nimprovement of 15.37 person years of work for the organization (50).\nThere appears to be more favorable opinions toward the\neffectiveness of this method than toward the method of paying for\nsick leave at retirement. The benefit is more immediate and\nnoticeable to the employee. It is typically provided at a time of year\n(after the holidays) when extra cash comes in handy to pay the bills.\nEmployees who view sick leave as a \"right\" (rather than insurance)\nusually see a direct one-for-one return on their trading of sick leave.\nTransit agencies may be reluctant to provide \"extra pay\" to\nemployees who don't use their sick leave, but at least they don't pay\nthe absent employee sick leave plus time-and-a-half to a replacement.\nIn addition, the sick leave paid for annually is paid at current pay\nrates, rather than the higher rates that would be in effect upon an\nemployee's retirement.\nTrading Unused Sick Leave for Annual Leave\nOnly 4 of the 36 transit agencies surveyed indicated that they allow\nemployees to trade unused sick leave for annual leave. This provision\nwould comply with a theory that time off is more important to an\nemployee than money. Transit agencies might realize savings if there\nare sufficient employees to cover an employee's shift without\nrequiring overtime.\nNone of the four agencies that use this incentive indicate that it\nis effective. Although one of the four agencies enjoys very low\nabsenteeism, it is believed that here employees are more interested in\ntrading unused sick leave for pay rather than more time off. Two\nother agencies indicated that only employees who have always\nexhibited good attendance use this incentive. The other agency rates\nitself a 10 on the \"absenteeism as a problem\" scale, meaning they\nperceive absenteeism to be a serious problem at their agency.\nLottery Games or Prizes for Employees with\nGood Attendance\nOnly 2 of 36 agencies reported the use of potential prizes as\nincentives for good attendance. The Milwaukee County Transit\nAgency provides $35 gift certificates every four months to bus\noperators with perfect attendance. These certificates can be used at\nlocal restaurants or shopping malls. All operators who have missed\nno more than 2 days over a 4-month time frame are eligible for gift\ncertificates. Approximately 45 such certificates are awarded on a\nlottery basis every 4 months. Although not everyone eligible wins a\ngift certificate, operators realize they will receive one if their\nattendance is perfect for the 4 months. It is a popular program that\nhas been in place for many years and is supported by both\nmanagement and labor. Managers at the agency cannot document the\nprogram's effects on absenteeism, but they believe it has merit.\nMaintenance employees at Milwaukee County Transit are eligible for\nsimilar sized rewards if they miss no time due to on-the-job injuries\nas part of a safety and attendance incentive program.\nThe Central Ohio Transit Authority (COTA) also uses a lottery\nfor its maintenance employees, which is part of an industrial safety\nprogram. To be eligible for the lottery cash prizes, a maintenance\nemployee must have both perfect\n\nattendance and no industrial accidents for the quarter. Everyone who\nthe first year of this program, absenteeism decreased by 21 percent\nhas accomplished that receives $10. Approximately 50 of 150\n(50).\nmaintenance employees meet these standards each quarter. Every\nemployee who has met those standards is then also eligible for a $40\naward. Twelve such cash prizes are selected in a lottery type of\nCash Awards for Perfect Attendance\ndrawing each quarter. One eligible employee also wins $500 each\nquarter on a lottery basis. This program is extremely popular with\nSeventeen of the 36 transit agencies surveyed indicated that they\nemployees. Everyone gets at least a small prize, about 25% receive a\noffer cash awards for perfect attendance. The amounts of the awards\nlarger cash award, and one employee wins a substantial amount. The\nvary substantially, from one day's pay to as much as $1,000 for a\nlottery is an exciting event each quarter that adds a little zest to the\nyear of perfect attendance. Some agencies award cash or certificates\nworkplace. There are no reported bad feelings from those who don't\nbased on quarterly performance, whereas others base awards on an\nwin. The agency believes this program has a positive impact on\nannual basis. A sampling of specific techniques is provided in Table\nattendance and will continue the program.\n3.\nPedalino and Gamboa reported on a unique lottery program\nIt is impossible to draw firm conclusions from this limited\nemployed at a manufacturing and distribution plant during the 1970s\namount of information, but there is evidence that incentives might\n(51).

The Greater Cleveland Regional Transit\nAuthority reported abandoning a program that paid up to $500 a year\nfor perfect attendance after evaluating their program and concluding\nit did not change behavior or reduce absenteeism. San Diego Transit\ninstituted what appeared to be an attractive incentive program in\n1993. Represented employees at San Diego Transit were eligible for\n$250 for each calendar quarter of perfect attendance (part-time\nemployees were eligible for $125 per calendar quarter). According to\nVice-President for Human Resources, Frank Shipman, attendance\nimproved in the first year of the program, but the next year\nabsenteeism began to climb until it reached its old levels by 1995.\nThe incentive program was discontinued as a result of collective\nbargaining in the following contractual agreement reached in 1996.\nOn the other hand, the Santa Clara County Transportation\nAuthority reported great success with their program, which offers as\nmuch as $1,000 per year to those with perfect attendance. Awards of\n$250 are earned for each quarter of perfect attendance. Santa Clara's\nprogram differs from San Diego's in one significant way: the quarters\nare \"rolling quarters,\" not calendar quarters. In other words, if an\nemployee should become sick one day, their \"next quarter\" to\nachieve perfect attendance starts the day they return to work. This\nprovides each employee with continuous incentive for perfect\nattendance even though they might miss work 1 day. San Diego's\nVice-President for Operations, Richard Murphy, believes that the\nlack of the \"rolling quarter\" provision probably hurt the chances for\nthe incentive program's success at his agency. Santa Clara's program\nhas been in place for 2 years, and unscheduled absences have been\nreduced from 12.5 percent to 9.8 percent. Managers credit the\nincentive program for this dramatic shift. Each reduction of 1 percent\nin absenteeism saves the agency $1 million per year.\nThe Capital Area Transportation Authority (CATA) in Lansing,\nMichigan, also reports great satisfaction with its substantial incentive\nprogram. At CATA, all represented employees are eligible for\nrewards of $125 for each calendar month of perfect attendance, and\nan additional $500 for perfect attendance for a full year. Hence,\nrepresented employees can earn up to $2,000 per year for perfect\nattendance. Employees are also eligible to receive $75 for each\ncalendar month in which they miss only 1 day and $50 for any\ncalendar month if they miss no more than 2 days. Part-time\nemployees are also eligible for bonuses of a proportionally lower\namount. Out of approximately 150 eligible employees, 56 had perfect\nattendance in 1998. It must be noted, however, that CATA provides\nno contractual sick leave pay as most transit agencies do. In other\nwords, employees who miss work because they are sick do\nnot get paid. Dave Smith, Director of Operations for CATA, reported\nthat the incentive program has helped reduce unscheduled\nabsenteeism at the agency from approximately 3 percent to 1 percent.\nAlthough he would not claim the program saved the agency money\non a pure dollar basis, he states that the program helps the agency\nachieve its overall goals of excellent attendance, positive\nlabor/management relations, and outstanding customer service. Mr.\nSmith notes that in addition to offering incentives, CATA is\nextremely firm in administering progressive discipline for those who\nviolate attendance policies. In spite of that firm approach, there have\nbeen no grievances submitted in the last 4 years. He believes the\nmore positive labor/management relationship saves the agency time\nand expense due to minimal grievances and avoided expenses\nassociated with arbitration and negotiations.\n\"Team Competition\" for Awards\nOnly three transit agencies reported that they use a team competition\nfor cash awards, where cash awards are based on the attendance\nrecords of preselected groups of employees. York County Transit\nuses incentives on both an individual performance basis and a team\nbasis. Although they believe individual performance incentives have\nworked, team incentives have been less effective.\nThe Orange County Transportation Authority (OCTA) offered\nan incentive to their maintenance employees that was focused on\nproductivity, but included an additional $100 per year for every\nmaintenance employee if the entire maintenance work force\nexperienced less than 3 percent unscheduled absences during the\nyear. This policy proved to be ineffective. The \"peer pressure\" that\nwas expected to occur didn't happen. Senior employees in particular\nshowed no signs of bowing to any pressure from other employees.\nOCTA revised their program to focus on individual incentives for the\nmaintenance employees. Each individual that achieves 3 months of\nperfect attendance earns $50. If an employee achieves perfect\nattendance during all four quarters, they receive an additional $100\n(for a total of $300 for the year.) This program has proven to be\npopular and effective. Of the 230 maintenance employees eligible for\nthe awards, approximately 165 have achieved perfect attendance for\nthe entire year.\nThe Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority recently\ninstituted a group incentive for all represented employees. If all\nbargaining unit employees as a group reach certain attendance goals,\nthey receive percentage bonuses of approximately $36 per quarter.\nAlthough this amount appears small in comparison to the $250 an\nindividual employee can earn with perfect attendance in a quarter, it\nrepresents a tangible benefit that even those who don't have perfect\nattendance can realize. Managers report that\n\nthe union is not particularly supportive of team-oriented awards\nbecause it tends to set one employee against another. However, it is\npart of the 5-year labor agreement.\nOther Techniques\nA variety of other techniques were identified as good attendance\nincentives. COTA holds an awards banquet for those with perfect\nattendance. Similarly, the Capital District Transit Authority (CDTA)\nin Albany, New York, holds an annual luncheon with the Executive\nDirector for all employees with perfect attendance over the past year.\nA number of agencies offer time off rather than money for those with\nperfect attendance. Montgomery County Transit in Maryland\nprovides 8 hours of annual leave for those with perfect attendance,\nwhereas Volusia County Transit (VOTRAN) in Daytona Beach,\nFlorida, provides an extra holiday for those with perfect attendance\nover 6 months. Two transit agencies mentioned that the attendance\nrecords of employees are part of the criteria for selecting employees\nof the month, quarter, and year. (It is likely most agencies consider\nattendance records when honoring their best employees.)\nCitifare in Reno/Sparks, Nevada, does not require perfect\nattendance to receive monetary awards. Employees who have four or\nfewer occurrences of absence receive 1 percent of their gross wages\nas a bonus at the end of the year. They also allow employees to\nreduce their number of occurrences by one if they attend a class that\nemphasizes the importance of good attendance.\nSun Tran in Tucson, Arizona, allows employees to \"sell back\"\nincentive time they earn. In this system, employees are credited with\na progressive number of hours for each month that they have perfect\nattendance. Every 6 months, employees can be paid for up to 16\nhours of the \"incentive time\" they have earned. If they do take\nunscheduled absence, they can cash in their incentive hours, but they\nmust start over again in the progressive cycle of accumulating hours.\nThe agency believes that the program works pretty well, with a high\npercentage of employees realizing cash benefits from their\nparticipation and good attendance.\nSunline Transit in Thousand Palms, California, is the public\ntransit provider in a region that has many small cities in a distant part\nof a large county. They have taken advantage of the vacuum in some\nservices that can't be efficiently provided by small cities or a large\ngeographic county. They have been very entrepreneurial in\ndeveloping a \"Sunline Services Division\" within their agency that\nprovides services such as street sweeping, graffiti removal,\ncompressed natural gas fueling stations, and street light maintenance.\nSunline gives their part-time bus operators first chance at working\nany of these jobs, in addition to\ntheir bus operating assignments. This allows the part-time employees\nto supplement their income and earn benefits. It has resulted in a\nlower turnover rate among part-timers and, in addition to other\nefforts, a very positive relationship between management and labor.\nBoth the Metropolitan Atlanta Regional Transit Authority\n(MARTA) and the Maryland Transit Administration (MTA) allow\nunused sick leave to be added to time worked for the purpose of\ncalculating pension benefits at the time of retirement. The MTA\nallows every 20 days of accumulated sick leave to be converted to a\nmonth's worth of attendance for the purposes of calculating pension\nbenefits upon retirement. Managers at MTA believe that this\ntechnique may only be a small part of the puzzle of achieving good\nattendance, but they believe it helps and they have no intention of\ndiscontinuing the practice. The Sacramento Regional Transit District\nallows unused sick leave to be \"sold back\" by employees and placed\ninto their deferred compensation accounts. Employees are allowed to\nsell back as much as the limit of their deferred compensation plans\nallow (up to $9,500 per year), but an employee must still retain at\nleast 480 hours of sick leave in the bank. Transit managers at\nSacramento regard this as more of a reward for those with good\nattendance than a behavior modifier for those with poor attendance.\nIn short, they don't think this technique has helped decrease\nabsenteeism.\nSummary of the Effectiveness of Incentives\nAs noted earlier, there is no consensus on the subject of\nwhether or not incentives are effective in improving attendance.\nMany transit managers feel very strongly that they are effective,\nwhereas others feel equally strongly that they are not. Some transit\nmanagers feel that they might only reward people who would have\ngood attendance records anyway. They might all be right with\nregards to how incentives have been implemented in their own\nagencies. Other local factors, such as the external environment of the\ntransit agency, might influence attendance and the value of\nincentives. For instance, two different agencies reported that the high\ncost of living in their areas makes monetary rewards more attractive.\nThe questionnaire for this project included the following\nquestion: \"Do you think your employees regard sick leave as a 'right'\nto be used whenever they want or as insurance for when it is really\nneeded?\" The vast majority (23) of the 33 agencies that responded to\nthis question clearly believe their employees regard sick leave as a\nright to be used whenever needed for personal reasons. That being\nthe case, it seems unlikely that a bus operator or mechanic would\ntrade having 12 paid days off (worth approximately $1,500) to gain a\nsmall bonus of approximately $120 (one day's pay) earned by having\nperfect attendance.\n\nPerhaps incentives need to be more substantive to be attractive\nenough to have an effect on attendance behavior. Most agencies\n(though not all) that offer larger cash awards report greater success\nwith their incentive programs. A more substantial award is likely to\nmake someone think a little harder when they are considering taking\na \"mental health\" day off. Clearly, the experiences from the Santa\nClara County Transportation Authority and the Capital Area\nTransportation Authority appear to support such a theory.\nIt might also be worthwhile to reconsider whether a year's\nworth of perfect attendance should be used as the standard when\njudging attendance performance. Perhaps it is unrealistic to expect\nbus operators in particular, who are often exposed to bad weather and\nhundreds of other people each day, to have perfect attendance over\nthe course of an entire year. In addition, if an employee should have\na legitimate illness early in the calendar year, they have no more\nincentive to achieve perfect attendance for the rest of the year. Most\nagencies that offer monetary awards for perfect attendance achieved\nduring a month, quarter, 4 months, or half-year believe that their\nincentives have a positive effect on attendance. Similarly, the one\nagency that provides a bonus of 1 percent of gross wages to all\nrepresented employees who have four or fewer occurrences of sick\nleave enjoys a stable and relatively low rate of absenteeism.\nOnly one transit agency made reference to offering a specific\nclass on the importance of good attendance. Such a course can help\nyounger employees in particular to consider the value of banking sick\nleave. Three agencies reported that they believe more senior\nemployees regard sick leave as insurance, whereas younger\nemployees regard it as time that they may use as needed. Younger\nemployees might not believe that they will work at the agency\nindefinitely, or they might not see themselves as being susceptible to\ninjury or long-term illness. A class on attendance could feature\nemployees who have suffered off-the-job injuries or sudden illnesses\nthat incapacitated them for many weeks. They can testify how their\nbank of sick hours kept paychecks coming in to pay the bills.\nMany transit agencies noted that incentives do not affect the\nbehavior of employees with poor attendance nor do they change the\nbehavior of those employees who already have excellent attendance\npatterns. However, the majority of employees fall somewhere in\nbetween the excellent and poor categories. Incentives can help\nreward and recognize the excellent employee and encourage the\naverage employee to improve.\n\"Lottery Awards\" for those with good attendance have worked\nquite well in the few places that reported using such incentives.\nThese programs not only offer the possibility\nof substantial awards to a few, but also add a little fun to the\nworkplace. Those that offer almost everyone who qualifies at least a\nlittle something are that much more likely to be successful.\nA few transit agencies that support incentives stated that they\nmust be publicized and well known to the employees. They noted\nthat it was also important to \"make a big deal\" out of the fact that\nemployees have earned such awards by means of announcements on\nbulletin boards, in newsletters, at meetings, and through letters sent\nto the employees' homes (so the rest of the family can see that the\nemployee has been honored.) In addition, a couple of agencies (and\nthe literature as well) stressed that incentives work best when there is\nalso good monitoring of unscheduled absences and progressive\ndiscipline is administered (52). This is consistent with Champaign-\nUrbana Executive Director Bill Volk's assessment that there is no\nsingle \"silver bullet\" that will reduce absenteeism at a transit agency.\nHe believes a comprehensive approach of \"carrots and sticks\" and a\nheavy dose of respect toward employees is required to keep\nabsenteeism in check.\nOne final note on the subject of incentives is how active (or\ninactive) transit agencies are in trying to determine their own\nemployees' feelings about the issue. Only 25 percent of the agencies\nindicated that they have sought the opinions of their employees as to\nwhat incentives would be attractive to them. Although a number of\nthe agencies responding affirmatively stated that they discussed such\nmatters during labor/management meetings or during negotiations,\nonly one agency indicated it used surveys to obtain their employees'\nattitudes toward incentives. Although methods of communication\nwith a unionized work force might be a sensitive issue, it would seem\nthat a better understanding of the feelings of the rank and file on this\nmatter, gained through surveys that could be mutually developed\nbetween labor and management, would be helpful in the development\nof meaningful incentive programs. Goodman and Atkins suggest\nasking employees two questions about what can be done to motivate\nthem to come to work. Those questions are \"what privileges would\npeople like to have that they do not have now?\" and \"what do you\nfind aversive or irritating in the work setting?\" (53).\nProviding Employees with More Flexible Schedules\nIn years past, represented transit employees (particularly bus\noperators) had little flexibility in their use of annual leave. In most\ncases, operators and mechanics were required to select their\nvacations for the coming year in weekly blocks. This made matters\neasier for bus operations schedulers, who have the difficult task of\ndeveloping cost-efficient run assignments in accordance with a\nmyriad of\n\nTABLE 4\nMETHODS AND EFFECTIVENESS OF GRANTING ANNUAL LEAVE IN DAILY INCREMENTS\nTransit Agency\nFeatures of Program\nEffectiveness in Minimizing\nAbsenteeism\nSun Tran (Albuquerque, N.

There is no need for additional personnel to cover\nsomeone's absence and there is minimal administrative\n\npaperwork, because both employees agree to collect the same\npaychecks. Operations managers want to be notified of the swap in\norder to keep track of their work force and make note of it on their\nrun sheets, but the process can otherwise be quite informal. The\nemployees do all of the work involved with the switch. Section\n553.31 of the federal Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) states:\nThe FLSA provides that two individuals employed in any\noccupation by the same public agency, to substitute for\none another during scheduled work hours in performance\nof work in the same capacity. Where one employee\nsubstitutes for another, each employee will be credited as\nif he or she had worked his or her normal work schedule\nfor that shift.\nFurthermore, the act states that the agency is required to be\naware of the arrangement prior to the work being done, but they are\nnot required to keep a record of the hours of the substitute work. An\nexample of the procedures and forms used at Broward County\nTransit in Pompano Beach, Florida, is attached as Appendix E. Some\nagencies offer unlimited opportunities to swap assignments, whereas\nothers limit such swaps to five per month. If an individual fails to\nreport for the assignment agreed upon as part of the swap, they may\nlose the right to take advantage of swap opportunities for 1 year.\nThe Roaring Fork Transit agency reports frequent use of this\nprovision, whereas Broward County Transit reports only occasional\nuse. One transit agency noted that the \"more responsible\" employees\nuse these swap provisions. They noted that no employee would want\nto swap with another employee who has an unreliable attendance\nrecord. There is, however, a general consensus that this is a tool that\nhelps employees and the transit agency, and helps, at least a little, in\nminimizing absences.\nOther Flexibility Methods\nA few other strategies offering flexibility were reported by transit\nagencies. In Albuquerque, personal days, per se, are not granted, but\n4 hours of vacation leave is provided for each 6-month period in\nwhich no sick leave is used. Two transit agencies noted that they\nbelieve 4-day workweeks should be regarded as a form of flexibility,\nwhereby employees are able to accomplish personal tasks during a\nnormal workweek without missing a day of work. Seattle Metro\nTransit noted that bus operators working 10/40 workweeks (10 hours\na day, 4 days a week) have better attendance records than operators\nworking 5-day weeks.\nSimilar benefits of the 10/40 workweek arrangement were\nreported by the City Street Department of Norfolk, Nebraska (54).\nThis schedule provided employees with the flexibility to address\nsome of their personal tasks that normally might require time off if\nthe employee worked a\nregular 5-day workweek. The program was deemed to be very\nbeneficial because it reduced absenteeism and overtime, improved\nemployee morale, and maximized the use of equipment.\nPierce Transit reported that they offer represented employees\n80 hours of unpaid leave each year. This leave must be preapproved\nby a supervisor a day in advance (approval is not guaranteed), but it\nallows employees the opportunity to take care of personal business\nwithout taking sick or annual leave. Although this might still require\npaying someone overtime to cover the absent employee's shift, at\nleast they are not also paying the absent employee sick or annual pay.\nThe employee might hope to make up for the pay missed by working\novertime during that pay period.\nPerhaps the most intriguing technique reported was a \"Paid\nTime Off' (PTO) program. In such a program there are no separate\ncategories for sick leave, annual leave, or personal leave. These\nprograms recognize that everyone needs time off, whether for illness,\nor vacation, or to take care of personal business or other obligations.\nEvery employee is granted so many paid personal days off per year\nto be used for whatever purpose they choose. Although the time truly\nis the employee's own there are still rules that apply, and there\nremains the emphasis on taking time off in a planned fashion,\napproved by the employer. Although there are rules and\nconsequences associated with a PTO program, there is a greater\nelement of trust and less separate documentation of sick leave. In\nsuch systems, absence from work is regarded as a performance\nproblem. Thus, employees with a record of excessive absenteeism\ncan be dismissed for poor performance, rather than misuse of sick\nleave.\nOne of the objectives of a PTO program is to discourage taking\n\"sick\" time off when the employee is not really sick. Employees\nrealize that those days used in that manner will come from their only\nbank of hours, which is there to cover vacation and personal business\ndays as well. The Dallas Area Rapid Transit agency now uses this\nmethod of managing leave for their administrative employees. These\nemployees used to be eligible for as many as 26 vacation days and 12\nsick days each year, and had the right to carry over and bank all of\ntheir hours (making them eligible for huge payoffs at retirement.)\nPTO now consists of vacation and sick leave lumped together. New\nemployees start at 17 total PTO days for the first 5 years, increasing\nby 3 days for every 5 years worked, with a cap of 29 PTO days. It is\nestimated that this program saves the agency $11 million over 10\nyears. However, they don't expect bargaining unit employees to agree\nto institute such a program.\nMARTA uses a system they refer to as \"Personal Paid Time\"\n(PPT). MARTA employees earn vacation time from\n\na separate account. Every employee accrues 1 day of PPT per month,\nand may accrue a maximum of 240 days of PPT. This time may be\nused for illness or personal business. However, there are limits to its\nuse. The first three occurrences of using PPT in a rolling 12-month\nperiod results in no consequences. Employees receive warnings on\nthe fourth, fifth, and sixth occurrences, and are terminated on the\nseventh occurrence, regardless of how many days of PPT they have\nin their bank.\nThe review of literature discovered that PTO was becoming\nmore widespread in other kinds of organizations. In a 1994 survey of\n360 organizations, 17 percent of respondents reported using PTO\nbanks, with another 13 percent considering their implementation\n(41). Also, PTO programs seem to be working: 86 percent of\nrespondents that used them indicated that they were effective, and\nnearly one-half had experienced a decrease in unscheduled absences\n(55). Memorial Hospital in Rockford, Illinois, instituted a PTO\nprogram in the late 1980s and claims to save more than $2.5 million\nper year in lower overtime costs, increased productivity (because of a\n36 percent decrease in unscheduled absences), and reduced costs for\ntemporary help (41).\nIn many organizations, employees are allowed to bank unused\nannual and sick leave hours and receive cash for some portion of this\ntime upon retirement. PTO programs discourage this \"banking\"\ntechnique. Employers believe that PTO not only saves the\norganization money, but helps reduce management's involvement in\nthe day-to-day life of employees while giving them more flexibility\nin their use of time (41).\nThe city of Fridley, Minnesota, established a PTO program in\nthe 1980s, with which it has been highly satisfied. Among other\nconsiderations, the city was concerned that employees who were\nabout to leave or retire were using excessive amounts of sick leave.\nThe city had previously provided employees with 12 days of annual\nleave and 12 days of sick leave. Under the PTO plan, employees now\nreceive 18 annual leave days, which can be used for annual or sick\nleave. After employees have worked with the city for 7 years, the\nnumber of leave days increases to 24, and after 15 years, it goes to\n26. New employees (and current employees who had accumulated\nfewer than 30 days leave) have a 30-day cap for accumulation at the\nend of any calendar year. Current employees who had accumulated\nmore than 30 days leave were treated in the following fashion: Each\nday of accumulated annual leave was counted as 1 day under the new\nplan. For sick leave, existing employees received 1 day of the new\nleave time for each day of sick leave accumulated under the old plan\nfor the first 45 days. Then, for the next 45 days of accumulated sick\nleave, employees received 1 day of the new sick leave for every 2\ndays accumulated under the old plan.\nAny additional sick leave was converted at the rate of 1 day for every\n3 days. The total amount (if more than 30 days) became the cap for\nthat particular employee. After being employed by the city for three\nyears, employees can cash in a maximum of 3 days of leave per year.\nAfter 15 years of service, employees can cash in 5 days (41).\nSummary of the Effectiveness of\nFlexibility Provisions\nIn general, transit agencies have demonstrated a great willingness to\naccommodate the needs all employees have for occasional flexibility\nin their time off. Most feel that their flexibility provisions help\nreduce absenteeism and the inappropriate use of sick leave to at least\na small degree. Some comment that their employees appreciate this\nbenefit and try to schedule their days off as far in advance as\npossible. No agency regretted providing this flexibility. Even if its\nmain affect is to improve employee morale, this in itself may help\nimprove overall attendance, reduce turnover, and help ensure\nemployee availability.\nMANAGEMENT CONTROLS ON THE USE OF\nSICK LEAVE\nThe previous section of this chapter, dealing with Preventive\nMeasures, illustrated proactive efforts transit agencies are using to\nhelp prevent sick leave absences. Some of the strategies, such as\nincentives, are sometimes referred to as \"carrots,\" which are\nnonpunitive techniques that encourage people to come to work. This\nsection of the report focuses on Management Controls. These\nstrategies assume that some employees will use sick leave\nexcessively and illegitimately, and often involve some form of\ndiscipline. They include:\n-\nRequirements to accrue a specified level of sick leave\nbefore sick leave is paid,\n-\nDenial of pay for the first day of sick leave after a certain\nnumber of occurrences,\n-\nRequiring documentation and auditing the authenticity of\nmedical certificates,\n-\nMethods for addressing patterns of absence,\n-\nProgressive discipline, and\n-\nManaging back-to-work programs.\nRequirements to Accrue a Specified Level of Sick Leave\nBefore Sick Leave Is Paid\nTwelve of 36 transit agencies reported that they require a certain\nlevel of sick leave to be accrued before the first day of sick leave will\nbe paid. Table 5 provides samples of the parameters established by\nsome of the agencies that enforce\n\nTABLE 5\nREQUIREMENTS TO ACCRUE A MINIMUM OF SICK LEAVE BEFORE SICK LEAVE WILL BE PAID\nTransit Agency\nAmount of Required Sick Leave\nThat Must Be Accrued Before\nPayment\nDoes It Help Control\nExcessive Sick Leave?\nMilwaukee County Transit\nTri-Met (Portland, Oreg.)\nAnn Arbor Transit (Mich.)\n38 days (300 hours)\n240 hours\n3 days\nYes\nWith most employees\nMinimal\nTARC (Louisville, Ky.)\nRTD (Denver, Colo.)\n50 days required to pay for first 3\ndays of sick leave\n85 days required to pay for first 2\nYes, fairly effective, but is being\nchanged as a result of collective\nbargaining\nNo, no difference in attendance\nSacramento RTD (Calif.)\ndays of sick leave\n480 hours\npatterns between those with and\nwithout 85 days of sick leave\nNo, especially when operator shortage\nresults in lots of overtime\nOpportunities\nNote: TARC = Transit Authority of River City; RTD = Regional Transit District\nthis provision. This technique is intended to force employees to save\ntheir sick leave if they want to be reimbursed. For at least a time, it\nmight deter employees from calling in sick to take a \"personal day\noff' if they can expect to be paid for that time.\nDenial of Pay for the First Day of Sick Leave\nAfter a Certain Number of Occurrences\nSix of 36 agencies reported that they deny reimbursement of sick\nleave pay if the employee has surpassed a certain number of sick\nleave occurrences. The provisions of such control techniques are very\nsimilar among the agencies using them. For example, Sun Tran in\nTucson, Arizona, does not pay for the first day of sick leave after the\nthird occurrence in a rolling 12-month period, and does not pay for\nthe first 2 days of sick leave after the fifth occurrence. Similarly,\nCitifare in Reno/Sparks, Nevada, does not pay for the first day of\nsick leave after the fourth occurrence in a 12-month rolling period,\nand does not pay for the first 2 days of sick leave after the seventh\noccurrence, unless the employee is hospitalized due to an accident or\nemergency.\nTransit agencies are generally satisfied with the effectiveness of\nthis control technique. Citifare claims that the penalties for incurring\nincidents of absenteeism are effective in reducing the total number of\ndays, but the provision of \"linking\" occurrences of continuous\ntreatment to one occurrence has been used excessively and needs to\nbe modified.\nDenial of Sick Leave Used Before or After Holidays\nEighteen of 36 agencies responded that they deny holiday pay if an\nemployee does not report to work immediately\nbefore and/or after a holiday. Most agencies commented that this is\nan effective strategy for ensuring that employees will not take an\nextra day off if they want to be paid for the holiday.\nRequiring Documentation and Auditing the\nAuthenticity of Medical Certificates\nThirty-one of the 36 agencies reported that they require some form of\nformal documentation (medical or otherwise) to support claims for\npaid time off. In many cases, the documentation is not required until\na certain number of absences have occurred, the number of days\nabsent exceeds a certain limit, and/or some form of patterned absence\nor suspicion develops about an employee's reason for missing work.\nFor example, Broward County Transit does not pay for sick leave if\nan employee is in \"sick leave monitoring\" status and fails to produce\nmedical documentation. The Washington Area Metropolitan\nTransportation Authority (WMATA) in Washington, D.C., requires\nemployees to submit a doctors' certificate for each absence in excess\nof three consecutive days and for each occurrence in excess of four\noccurrences per year. At Seattle Metro Transit, if medical certificates\nare not turned in by a stipulated time and with appropriate\ninformation, sick days become unexcused absences and discipline\napplicable to misses applies. A few agencies noted that they reserve\nthe right to call the employee's doctor to verify the nature of the\nillness or injury, and some also reserve the right to visit the\nemployee's home when they are using sick leave.\nAlthough most agencies reported that they require medical\ndocumentation to validate a claim for sick leave, only 13 of the 36\nagencies actually check the authenticity of the medical notes. Many\nagencies expressed frustration with the relative ease employees have\nin getting HMOs to\n\nprovide doctors' certificates verifying a visit, but offering little else\nabout the nature of the visit. Of those who claim to check the\nauthenticity of doctor's notes, all but one indicated they did it on only\na spot check basis or when there was cause for suspicion. At\nWMATA, the position of Absenteeism Manager has been established\nto deal with nothing but employees who are missing work. No other\ntransit agency surveyed has made such a commitment. There are two\nAbsenteeism Managers at WMATA. At WMATA, managers believe\nit is important to consistently communicate the organization's interest\nin attendance, or it won't improve.\nAt WMATA, if a supervisor believes a health care provider is\nsigning certificates negligently or in bad faith, he will advise the\nAbsenteeism Manager and the Authority's Medical Director. The\nAuthority's Medical Director will investigate, discuss the problem\nwith the provider, and will, if necessary, initiate action to exclude\nnoncooperating providers from participation in Authority-funded\nhealth and welfare programs. The Absenteeism Manager, acting on\nthe advice of the Medical Director, will periodically distribute to\nsupervisors a list of health care providers who are believed to have\nprovided doctors' certificates under questionable circumstances.\nThe Port Authority of Allegheny County (PAT) in Pittsburgh,\nPennsylvania, was not asked to complete this survey; however, the\nagency did advise this report's principle investigator of the\neffectiveness of the auditing that they performed in 1995. PAT's\nhourly employees are required to furnish a certificate from an\nattending physician for illnesses of two or more working days in\norder to be compensated for absences due to illness. It was\ndetermined that the same physician was completing an inordinate\nnumber of requests. A decision was made to conduct an intensive\nreview of all sick pay requests from the most recent 2-year period. A\nspecial audit/review was performed by in-house staff. As a result of\nthis audit, 10 percent of all sick pay requests are now reviewed\nquarterly on a continuing basis. Knowing that sick leave requests are\nnow subject to regular audit, employees' use of sick leave has\ndecreased. PAT averaged 4,500 sick leave requests annually prior to\nreview and is currently averaging approximately 3,600 requests post\nreview. This effort has resulted in estimated savings of $280,000 per\nyear.\nMethods for Addressing Patterns of Absence\nSimilar to receiving holiday pay based on the necessity to report to\nwork before and/or after a given holiday, this method addresses other\ntypes of patterned absence, such as the Friday/Monday absences\naround weekends or those before or after an employee's days off.\nNineteen of the 36 agencies responded that they do have methods for\ndealing\nwith these types of absences. In most cases, the method they refer to\nis counseling and/or warnings, which are provided at any time an\nemployee begins to evidence patterns of absence.\nVOTRAN in Daytona Beach, Florida, reviews occurrences of\nabsence every quarter. Employees who display pattern absences are\nplaced on \"payroll notification,\" meaning no sick days are paid\nwithout medical documentation. They report that in most cases\nemployees who have already been counseled generally improve\nwithout having to be placed on payroll notification.\nAt WMATA, if any employee shows a pattern of absences on a\nspecific day of the week or month, the Absenteeism Manager may\ndetermine that doctors' certificates for future absences for medical\nreasons must be approved by the Authority's Medical Officer.\nAs noted in chapter 1, a number of agencies reported that they\nare struggling with the provisions of the FMLA. One agency has\nhired an FMLA Coordinator, while another cited their efforts in\nestablishing a Quality Improvement Team to improve the process\nand administration of FMLA cases. Transit agencies often require the\nemployee, as the law allows, to obtain a second medical certification\nfrom a health care provider of the employer's choosing, at the\nemployer's expense. If the opinions of the employee's and the\nemployer's designated health care providers differ, the employer may\nrequire the employee to obtain certification from a third health care\nprovider, again at the employer's expense, whose opinion shall be\nfinal and binding. The third health care provider must be approved\njointly by the employer and the employee. Employees are also being\nrequired to recertify their condition every 60 days. WMATA has\ntaken that requirement one step further, notifying their employees\nthat they must provide medical documentation every time they are\nabsent for the same reason, unless the doctor has already specifically\nnoted the time off required in a previous certificate. WMATA's\nAbsenteeism Manager, Adrienne Francis, states that \"it is not\nreasonable to not get verification.\" Although she genuinely\nsympathizes with any individual with a legitimate illness, employees\nmust still be held accountable for their absences. This is consistent\nwith WMATA's \"zero tolerance\" for abuse of sick leave.\nSix transit agencies reported that they deny pay for sick leave in\nmanners different than those described previously. Pierce Transit will\ndeny sick leave for employees who claim to be suffering depression\ndue to disciplinary action that has been taken against them. The\nCDTA in Albany, New York, and the Bi-State Development Agency\nin St. Louis, Missouri, do not pay for the first 2 days of absence in\nany situations, and believe that this is an effective way\n\nTABLE 6\nSCHEDULES OF SAMPLE STANDARD PROGRESSIVE DISCIPLINE PROGRAMS\nTransit Agency\nAllowed Absences Before Progressive\nDiscipline Starts\nNumber of Steps to Termination After\nProgressive Discipline Is Started\nSun Tran (Albuquerque, N.

On the eighth absence or fifth occurrence\ntotaling more than 60 hours, the employee is subject to termination.\nVirtually every agency (35 of 36) reported that they use progressive\nAlthough this policy appears to be relatively strict, operations\ncounseling and/or suspensions at well-understood intervals prior to\nmanagers have the authority to \"mitigate\" (in essence, erase) an\npossible termination for unacceptable attendance.

At that point, the Absenteeism Manager will review\nthe facts relevant to each identified employee, including such\nconcerns as the employee's overall attendance record, presence of\nmajor medical problems, prognosis for medical recovery, duration of\npast absences, employee's length of service, etc. The Absenteeism\nManager will direct an appropriate action including anything from\ncontinued employment subject to the Medical Office's approval of\ndoctor's\ncertificates,\nto\nreassignment\nto\nother\nduties,\nto\ndisqualification and discharge. The manager will review each\nidentified employee at 3-month intervals, or more frequently, until\nattendance becomes satisfactory or until the employee is discharged.\nSome agencies prescribe \"working suspensions,\" where\nemployees are issued the equivalent of a suspension for purposes of\nthe record, but work their normal shift during the dates of the \"paper\"\nsuspension. Other agencies report that the only way to send a\nmessage on the importance of attendance is to \"hit the employees in\nthe pocket book\" by having them serve the suspension.\nFive of the 36 agencies reported using \"point systems\" to track\nand manage employee attendance. Point systems can take into\naccount all forms of attendance problems including sick leave and\nlate reports. A different number of points are assessed for each\noccurrence, and when a certain number of points are accumulated\nprogressive discipline measures are implemented.\nAn example of a point system was reported by TARC (Transit\nAuthority in River City) in Louisville, Kentucky (see Appendix F).\nPoints are not charged for scheduled absences, such as vacation or\npersonal days, nor are they assessed for absence due to on-the-job\ninjuries. However, points are charged against recurring or excessive\nabsences such as sick leave. One point is charged for a full-day\nexcused absence, and a half point is charged for a half-day excused\nabsence. An \"excused absence\" is one that is documented with a\ndoctor's note. Two points are charged for a full-day unexcused\nabsence, whereas one point is charged for a half-day unexcused\nabsence. An \"unexcused absence\" is defined as one in which no\ndoctor's note is provided. Once an employee accumulates 10 points,\nthey receive counseling. When the employee has accumulated 15\npoints, they are counseled and advised that they are on \"probation.\"\nThis alerts the employee that continued unscheduled absences could\nput their job in jeopardy. At 20 points, employees are discharged.\nManagers at TARC believe this has been somewhat effective. Bus\noperators average\n10.2 days of unscheduled absence per year, whereas maintenance\npersonnel average 6.6 days.\nPoint systems in and of themselves do not guarantee success in\ncontrolling excessive absenteeism. One large transit agency that\ncurrently uses a point system is averaging 31 days of unscheduled\nabsences per year per employee, far more than the average of 16.07\nreported by the 36 agencies surveyed for this report.\nManaging Back-to-Work Programs\nWorker's Compensation\nAs part of the survey used for this synthesis project transit agencies\nwere asked the following question: \"On a scale of 1 to 10, with 1\nmeaning no problem and 10 meaning a serious problem, how do you\nrate the nature of workers compensation in your agency?\" The\naverage score provided by 33 responding agencies was 6. Perhaps\nthis problem was rated less serious than overall absenteeism because\nthere are more straightforward steps agencies can take to help\nminimize the possibilities of on-the-job injuries. However, the expert\npanel for TCRP SF-06 agreed that as long as there are opportunities\nfor people to get paid 85 to 90 percent of their salaries by \"working\nthe system,\" there will be some people who are going to take\nadvantage of such opportunities.\nThe majority of the transit agencies reporting on their methods\nof handling worker's compensation absences indicated that they use\nthird party administrators (TPAs) to manage the details of getting\ninjured transit employees to expert physicians and to stay on top of\ntheir recuperative process to ensure the fastest possible return to\nwork. Some believe that TPAs are like any other professional service\nthat offers experience and specialty expertise in an area in which the\ntransit agency has no particular strength. Some believe it is important\nto have an outside party serve as the administrator of worker's\ncompensation claims to avoid potential collusion between transit\nagency employees who might have personal friendships.\nOne frequently stated recommendation offered by multiple\nagencies was to not lose track of any employee absent due to\nworker's compensation. Appendix G provides the flow chart used at\nPierce Transit, which illustrates how they administer all their cases of\nemployees who have been injured on (or off) the job. Pierce Transit's\nRedeployment Program serves as a good illustration of how such\ncases must be managed aggressively. Contact should be made weekly\nwith the employee. One agency noted that it reserves the right to visit\nthe employees at their homes. A number of agencies noted that they\nused independent medical exams, sought second opinions when they\nthought\n\nit appropriate, and cross-referenced claims with the state agency\nresponsible for worker's compensation. A number of agencies\nreported that they used private investigators for surveillance of\nparticularly suspicious cases. A few agencies reported on their use of\nattorneys who specialize in workers compensation litigation.\nSome agencies reported that their state's worker's compensation\nlaws were extremely liberal and that they were frustrated in their\nattempts to manage such cases. New Jersey Transit noted that the\nstate of New Jersey gives medical control of workers compensation\ncases to the employer. Their own medical department is in a much\nbetter position to oversee cases, and they report workers\ncompensation to be only a mild problem.\nOther agencies stressed the importance of their agency's self-\ninsured status. This puts a greater responsibility on the agency to\nstress safety and accident prevention. Citifare in Reno/Sparks,\nNevada, related their success in getting assistance from the State\nIndustrial Insurance System loss prevention team. That team came to\ntheir agency and reviewed everything related to driving a bus, and\ndeveloped training programs and provided recommendations that\nhave helped the agency decrease its insurance expenses by $300,000\nper year.\nLight Duty\nTwenty-seven of 36 agencies reported that they employ light duty (or\nmodified duty) programs that encourage employees who have missed\nwork due to on-the-job injuries to return to work as quickly as\npossible. The vast majority of transit agencies expressed satisfaction\nwith the effectiveness of light duty programs. Agencies report that\nthey don't want the employee to get into the habit of staying at home.\nConsequently, they identify work that the employee can do for the\nagency without risking aggravations to their injuries. Examples of\nsuch work include providing transit information as part of the\ntelephone customer services function or providing information at\ntransit centers. Other types of jobs include patrolling the perimeter of\nagency property, helping in the print shop, and doing simple clerical\nwork. None of the work is particularly attractive and the boring\nnature of some of the work and being paid at less than the employee's\nstandard wage, seems to serve as an incentive to return to work. As\none agency noted, employees performing light duty feel that if they\nare already at work they might as well be making their full wage.\nIn almost all cases, light duty is only offered to employees who\nare missing work due to a worker's compensation claim. One agency\nreported that if an employee refuses to perform light duty work that\nthey are deemed medically able to do, they lose worker's\ncompensation benefits.\nSummary of Management Controls\n-\nIt should come as no surprise that people's behavior will be\nstrongly influenced by the boundaries that govern such\nbehavior. The stricter rules that have been put in place by\ntransit agencies to help control sick leave have generally been\nmore successful than less strict rules. For instance, transit\nagencies that only allow a few days of absence before\nprogressive discipline starts, rather than a few occurrences of\nabsence, tend to show a lower rate of unscheduled absenteeism.\nAgencies that deny pay for the first day of sick leave after so\nmany occurrences of sick leave in a 12-month period report that\nsuch provisions are effective. Denying sick leave pay for days\nbefore and after holidays has also been successful.\n-\nWhen people are held accountable for their actions, it is likely\nthat their actions will be more responsible. Lack of \"follow-up\"\nor lax administrative monitoring is one factor that many transit\nmanagers report as a contributing factor to absenteeism in their\nagencies. A few agencies made that point abundantly clear\nwhen they noted that their progressive discipline programs\nwork well when they are being properly monitored and\nadministered, and not very well when they are not. One\nmanager of an agency with a much higher than average rate of\nunscheduled absenteeism noted, \"You could have all the\npolicies in the world to control absenteeism, but if they are not\nenforced and monitored, they do little good in controlling the\nproblem.\"\n-\nInconsistent application of attendance policies has many\npotential causes and works against an agency's efforts to reduce\nabsenteeism. One agency reported that attendance policies that\nare complex and hard to understand are difficult for some\ntransit supervisors to administer. Another explanation offered\nby some agencies for inconsistent application of attendance\npolicies is that some managers, those who come from the ranks\nof bus operators and mechanics, may find it uncomfortable to\nadminister discipline to their former peers. Part of the problem\nmight be the lack of information systems that provide frequent\nand regular reports on unscheduled absence that are easy to use\nand understand. In addition, because of tight budgets, some\ntransit agencies might not be able to find the administrative\nresources to thoroughly audit sick leave use or monitor\nemployees' overall attendance records. However, the return on\nsuch an investment could be substantial. Transit agencies that\nhave conducted thorough audits of doctors' certificates have\nreported substantial reductions in requests for sick leave. The\nmessage that someone is checking the validity of doctors' notes\ngets around quickly and can be\n\neffective. WMATA dedicates resources for two positions\nknown as Absenteeism Managers, whose responsibility is to\nmonitor attendance performance on an agency-wide and\nindividual employee basis, and take action as soon as trends\nand patterns occur. This large agency averages only 9.36 days\nof unscheduled absence per employee per year (compared with\nthe 16.07 average of all agencies surveyed for this project.)\n-\nAlthough it was clear when transit agencies started progressive\ndisciplinary procedures, it was not clear if agencies kept\nemployees informed of their status at the early stages of the\nprocess. The Maryland Mass Transit Administration noted that,\nalthough their progressive discipline process doesn't start until\nthe sixth occurrence of sick leave in a rolling 12-month period,\nthey now verbally counsel each employee at their third, fourth,\nand fifth occurrences. Perhaps early notification could help\nkeep employees from getting to the point where progressive\ndiscipline is necessary.\n-\nDenying pay for the first day of sick leave after a certain\nnumber of sick leave occurrences in a 12-month period seems\nto work to the satisfaction of those agencies that use it. It is a\ntechnique not used until a pattern of absence has been\ndemonstrated by the employee and possibly influences the\ndecision of an employee who is not really sick (but is\nconsidering calling in sick) to come into work that day. There is\nless consensus on the technique of denying the payment of the\nfirst few days of sick leave until the employee has accrued a\nfairly substantial amount of sick leave. Some believe that it is a\ntough, but realistic tool to use in the transit environment that\nhas helped them control excessive absenteeism. Others question\nthe basic fairness of a strategy where you allow employees to\nearn sick leave, but not to be paid for the first few days of its\nlegitimate use, until the employee has accrued a fairly\nsubstantial amount of sick leave time, which can only be gained\nover a number of years. The only transit agency that actually\nanalyzed the technique by establishing two control groups (one\nwith the required number of hours accrued and one without)\nconcluded that there was no statistical difference between the\nattendance performance of the two groups. Another reason to\nquestion this technique is the potential chilling affect it might\nhave on attracting good candidates for employment,\nparticularly during times when unemployment is low and\ncompetition for good employees is fierce. This denial of sick\nleave pay might cause applicants to look elsewhere when\nmaking their choice of where to work.\nOTHER MANAGEMENT INTERVENTIONS\nTo this point, the report has reviewed the preventive measures and\nmanagement controls transit agencies have used to try to assure\nemployee availability and minimize absenteeism. There is yet\nanother set of strategies transit agencies report using that don't neatly\nfit into one of these first two categories. This section describes those\nstrategies that are generally quite progressive and that tend to stress\norganizational and personal development. They can be applied either\nbefore or after an absence occurs. The strategies that will be\nreviewed include:\n-\nGroup Supervisor programs\n-\nTotal Quality Management\n-\nPositive discipline\n-\nCommunicatin g the importance of good attendance.\nIn addition, this section will describe some of the ways transit\nagencies are modifying their procedures of attracting and hiring new\nbus operators to be more competitive in an \"employees' market.\"\nGroup Supervisor Programs\nTen of the 36 agencies reported that they use the \"group supervisor\"\nprogram in their bus operations division. This program is designed to\nhelp \"personalize\" the work environment for a bus operator who\nworks in the field and doesn't get many chances to interact with other\nrepresentatives of the agency. In particular, in large transit agencies\noperations supervisors tend to police the system and respond to\nincidents, but do very little supervision or coaching of operators. In a\ngroup supervision program, each operations supervisor takes\nresponsibility for knowing at least a little about 20 to 30 bus\noperators. They familiarize themselves with the operators' work\nrecord, including attendance, and provide advice accordingly. They\nalso serve as a conduit between management and operators, and can\nbe an advocate for bus operators, when appropriate. This type of\nprogram is not focused solely on attendance. However, it helps build\nbetter spirit among workers and puts a more human face on what can\nbe a very cold employment environment. The relationship that can be\ndeveloped between supervisors and operators can help attendance\nperformance. The British Institute of Management found that low\nabsence rates have been noted as one of the effects of the higher\nmorale often found in small working groups. They also found that\nopening the lines of communication between employees and higher\nlevels of management helped to reduce absenteeism by reducing\nstress (56).\nThe presence of a group supervisor program is usually\nindicative of the agency's recognition of the importance of\n\nemployees as the most valuable resource in a service agency. Hence,\nit is not surprising that the average score for transit agencies utilizing\ngroup supervision programs was 6.1 on the \"attendance as a\nproblem\" scale, compared with 7.1 for those agencies that do not use\nsuch programs. Agencies that use this strategy averaged 10 days of\nunscheduled absence per year, whereas agencies that do not averaged\n17.06 days of unscheduled absence.\nA number of agencies have considered establishing such a\nprogram, but find that the logistics of dealing with the far-flung,\nfield-oriented bus operator work force are difficult to overcome San\nDiego Transit has found that mobile data terminals in supervisors'\ncars help to overcome some of the logistical difficulties. These\nterminals allow supervisors in the field to track and record bus\noperator performance. While in their cars, supervisors can enter\ninformation on their mobile data terminals that is then placed in the\nemployee's records. Supervisors can meet with bus operators while\nthey are in the field and be knowledgeable of the operator's\nperformance based on a review of their records by means of the\nmobile data terminals. San Diego currently has computerized day-to\nday tracking of each employee in every area, including miss outs,\nattendance, personal development planning, special requests, and\ndrug testing.\nSan Diego Transit (the first transit agency in the nation to\ninstitute the Group Supervisor program in 1980) believes the most\nimportant benefit of the program is to give a line employee a real\nconnection with a management employee. Every month each\nsupervisor makes at least two personal contacts with each member of\nhis group. Over the years the groups have competed with each other\nin areas of attendance. This personal contact usually results in fewer\ngrievances because a line employee has a bond with a supervisor.\nThat supervisor gets involved with any action that effects that\noperator. Frank Shipman, San Diego Transit's Vice-President for\nHuman Resources, believes the program offers a great way to open\nlines of communication throughout the organization. He notes that\ndrivers now have a choice of seeking counsel from their union or\ntheir group supervisor. The agency is starting the process of\npreparing \"Personal Development Plans\" for each operator.\nChapter 2 described many of the potentially unattractive\nfeatures of being a bus operator. Pierce Transit also describes some\nof the difficulties new bus operators will face in \"The Life of a Relief\nOperator at Pierce Transit\" (Appendix D). Consequently, it should\ncome as no surprise that many transit agencies around the country\nreported that their highest turnover was among new bus operators,\nmany of whom are relatively young. Young employees in particular\nmight need more coaching and counseling on the basics of job\npreparedness. Agencies\nmight need to put special effort into communicating with young\nemployees to teach them about job responsibilities and to make them\nfeel they are part of an agency that is interested in their well being. In\nspeaking about Generation X, Losyk recommends that employers\ndevelop mentoring programs to increase their loyalty and keep\nemployees on board longer (8). LYNX, in central Florida, has\nrecently started a Mentoring Training Program in which experienced\noperators guide, tutor, and advise new operators during the first\nweeks of their careers to help make their adjustment to the \"LYNX\nlike\" way of doing things as natural as possible.\nA mentor can offer encouragement, answer questions, and lend\nan empathetic ear to drivers before they hit the road on their own. A\nmentor lends support and provides advice on the everyday challenges\nof being a bus operator that may not necessarily be covered in the\ninitial training. Each mentoring experience lasts between 60 and 120\ndays, depending on the need of the new operator. LYNX Director of\nOperations Bill Schneeman states that \"Adjustments to any new job\ncan be overwhelming, but those a bus driver experiences are even\nmore demanding, not only for the employee, but also for his or her\nfamily\" (57). Mentors perform their roles on a purely voluntary basis,\nalthough the agency recognizes them with certificates, awards, and\nconstant praise and recognition. Ongoing recognition increases\nemployee involvement and helps employees feel a commitment to\ntheir work environment. Recognition also reinforces desired\nbehaviors, builds self-esteem, nurtures trust and respect, says \"thank\nyou,\" renews enthusiasm, affirms self-worth, and celebrates success\n(58). The success of the program has been astonishing. Turnover\namong part-time bus operators was reduced from 50 percent to 8\npercent in 1998 (6).\nTotal Quality Management\nTotal Quality Management (TQM) is a management philosophy\nconcerned with people and work processes that focuses on customer\nsatisfaction and improving organizational performance. TQM\nrequires an enterprise to systematically energize, manage, coordinate,\nand improve all business activities in the interest of its customers\n(59). It is a comprehensive philosophy that focuses organizational\nresources on the improvement of work processes by empowering\nwell-trained employees to meet or exceed customer expectations\n(58). TQM is highly process-oriented and requires clear and accurate\nmeasurement of agency progress toward established goals.\nGiven the industry's renewed focus on the importance of the\ncustomer, and given the ability of transit agencies to quantify much\nof what they do, it would seem that TQM might be commonly\napplied at transit agencies. However,\n\nimplementers of TQM in the public sector face challenges not found\nin the private sector, including a lack of market incentives, a short-\nterm perspective caused by frequent political changeovers, a highly\ncentralized and layered structure, a separation of powers that requires\nnegotiation and consensus building, conflicting needs between\nvarious customer groups, and an emphasis on due process over\nefficiency (59). Recent research has found that most of the\nfoundations for TQM are not yet in place in the transit industry (58).\nMost transit governing boards and unions are not actively involved in\nissues of quality. Policy statements have not been formed, transit\nemployees have not been trained in the process, and the measurement\nof results is not very rigorous. However, at least one agency has put\nconsiderable effort into the TQM program.\nBy 1990, the Southwest Ohio Regional Transit Authority\n(Metro) in Cincinnati, Ohio, had recognized that their agency had\nbecome a classic bureaucracy, with a top-down command and control\nsystem in place. Labor relations were poor, and the performance of\nthe agency in terms of complaints, accidents, road calls, and\nattendance was not satisfactory (60). In 1990, this agency undertook\na 5-year transformation to become a more empowering, flexible\norganization. To implement this transformation, Metro developed a\nnew vision for the organization. More than 900 employees\nparticipated in intensive 1-day sessions designed to review current\npractices at Metro and then to envision what a \"perfect\" Metro could\nbe. Cross-organizational teams of employees from every level of the\norganization drafted the following vision statement:\n1.\nWe make Cincinnati a great place to live,\n2.\nCustomers are why we're here,\n3.\nOutstanding service is our commitment, and\n4.\nEmployees are Metro; we are a team.\nUnion leaders were involved in the process from the start. Once\nthe process of reengineering the agency and the development of\ndozens of cross-functional teams were established to address a\nmyriad of issues, the pressure was on both management and the\nunion to change their relationship. Confrontation was replaced with\ncooperation, joint problem solving, and employee involvement at all\nlevels of the organization. As a result, every major area of service\nquality has improved, including preventable accidents, miles between\nroad calls, and passenger complaints. Overall absenteeism (including\nunscheduled) steadily decreased from 10.5 percent in 1994 to 8.9\npercent in 1997 (61). The agency can provide no other reason for the\nimprovement in attendance.\nTQM is an arduous undertaking, and many organizations that\nstart such a process do not succeed (59). However, the development\nof cross-functional teams has often been recommended as a way of\nincreasing morale and\nproductivity. Participating in cross-functional teams can improve job\nsatisfaction, teamwork, and productivity (62). Goodman and Atkins\n(53) report that job satisfaction is an important quality to have among\nemployees. It reduces stress and helps to provide employees with a\nsense of a particular identity and a sense of fitting in. Some methods\nnecessary to create this sense of belonging, which increases the\nlikelihood that an employee will not take unexcused absences, are an\nability to participate in important decisions about group objectives, to\ncontribute to the performance of the group in a significant way, and\nto share in the rewards of the group accomplishments.\nMany transit agencies have established cross-functional\ncommittees, some of which can have direct and indirect impacts on\nattendance. For instance, 23 of 36 agencies surveyed for this report\nacknowledged that unattractive work schedules with split shifts,\nnonconsecutive days off, or graveyard shifts probably contribute to\nabsenteeism. A number of agencies have established \"Route Review\nCommittees\" to help solve problems with routes that are difficult to\noperate. Improvements in these working conditions can affect\nemployee morale and attendance\nTQM starts and ends with training (58). Pierce Transit\nrecognizes the need for all of its personnel to grow and develop and\nhas instituted a seminar entitled \"Increasing Human Effectiveness:\nManaging the Rapids of Change.\" The 2-day seminar is based on the\npremise that the way people feel about themselves affects their\nperformance in all areas of life (including work). The concepts that\nare covered are designed to help employees\n1.\nDevelop a posit ive self-image,\n2.\nIncrease self-confidence,\n3.\nDevelop self-esteem,\n4.\nOvercome fear of failure,\n5.\nOvercome self-imposed limitations,\n6.\nSet positive goals,\n7.\nHandle stress and change, and\n8.\nDevelop a winning attitude.\nPierce Transit managers believe the investment in the program\nwill result in employees who are flexible, positive, poised,\nenthusiastic and effective human beings. According to Marnie\nSlakey, the agency wants to help its employees be successful in\ncoping with on-the-job stress. They also want each employee to be\ntrained to take responsibility for their actions, to be in control of their\nfate. Improving each employee's effectiveness is also intended to\nhelp reduce absenteeism. Pierce Transit averages 11 days of\nunscheduled absence per represented employee per year, far better\nthan the 16.07 average reported by the 36 agencies surveyed for this\nproject. Ms. Slakey notes that training has not been used as\neffectively as it could be in the transit industry. Members of this\nsynthesis' review\n\npanel agree that training has often been characterized as being part of\nthe disciplinary process. Transit agencies should realize that training\ncould be a more proactive part of each employee's development\nprocess.\nPositive Discipline\nA small number of the agencies reported that they now use the\nconcept of \"positive discipline.\" These agencies do not use a punitive\nmethod of dealing with poor attendance (e.g., suspending people\nfrom work without pay). The transit agency still sets the standards for\nwhat is regarded as acceptable attendance. If an employee does not\ncomply with these standards, the agency requires the employee to\ntake a day off, with pay, to reconsider their commitment to the\norganization. This day is sometimes referred to as \"decision making\nleave.\" Before returning, the employee prepares an action plan\n(sometimes referred to as a \"behavioral contract\") for which they will\nbe held accountable. Attendance requirements for the next 6 to 12\nmonths are usually quite strict. Agencies report that the attendance of\nmost employees in these circumstances improves. Positive discipline\nrequires that the employee accept responsibility for achieving good\nattendance. The action plan drafted by the employee is negotiated\nwith management, and the agreement of the employee to the\nprovisions of the plan places the onus on them to improve their\nattendance.\nCOTA uses a system with elements of positive discipline. At\nCOTA, absences of only 1 day or several consecutive days are\nconsidered \"Attendance Events.\" No action is taken during the first\neight attendance events in a rolling 12-month period. A verbal\nwarning is issued at the ninth event, a written warning at the tenth,\nand on the eleventh event the employee must visit the Human\nResources Department for counseling. On the twelfth event there is\nfinal counseling and a warning that the thirteenth attendance event\nwill result in discharge. COTA managers report that discharge based\non attendance performance is extremely rare and that the policy is\ntoo liberal to adequately control absenteeism. However, their level of\nunscheduled absence (11.5 days per year) is less than the average for\nall agencies surveyed (16.07 days per year).\nProgressive discipline processes are designed to ultimately\nreduce poor attendance, but suspensions that are part of the process\ncontribute, at least temporarily, to absences. A positive discipline\nprogram addresses the inconsistency between suspending employees\nfrom work due to attendance infractions after emphasizing the\nimportance of good attendance. It saves the agency the costs of\ncovering the shift of someone serving a suspension. It also respects\nthe employees' need for income and therefore reduces the animosity\nthat might be felt by an employee toward their\nemployer as a result of a suspension. As one manager noted, if you\nreally are trying to develop trust and teamwork between labor and\nmanagement, suspensions probably aren't going to help. Goodman\nand Atkins concur that severe discipline may be more\ncounterproductive than helpful, especially when dealing with\nemployees who have problems related to alcoholism or drugs (53). A\nnumber of agencies reported that they require employees at certain\nstages of progressive discipline to use the services of counseling\nmade available through their EAP program. Availing themselves of\nthis resource might result in identifying confidential matters that\naffect the employee and lead them to resources that can improve their\nattendance.\nCommunicating the Importance of Good Attendance\nIf good attendance is a high priority for transit agencies, that message\nshould probably be communicated in a variety of ways. It is difficult\nto motivate if one doesn't communicate. One example from the\nprivate sector helps illustrate this. Lewis (63)\ndescribes\nthe\nefforts of a Canadian shipbuilding company that emphasized\ncommunicating the importance of good attendance by means of\nmanuals, training, interface with the union, and person-to-person\ncommunications. At this company, the morale of workers improved\nand they became generally more productive because the company\ncommunicated the value of their attendance at work.\nOnly 14 of 36 agencies reported that they practice this\ntechnique in a concerted fashion. At one agency, the director of\ntransportation puts out memos on bulletin boards, has parties to\ncelebrate good attendance performance, and highlights good\nperformers through award programs that take attendance into\naccount. This same agency also has huge posters that show the\nagency's overall attendance performance. Another agency produces a\nbi-weekly newsletter with stories that feature employees with\nexemplary attendance.\nAT&T took a little different approach to informing employees\nof their attendance performance. The company had tried many\ndifferent approaches to reducing absenteeism, but what worked best\nwas the creation of a bulletin board with everyone's name on it. Each\nname was in letters large enough for all to see. A gold star was\nplaced in designated spaces each day the employee came to work.\nAT&T found that this reduced absenteeism drastically because\nemployees knew that someone was monitoring their absences and all\npeople in the agency were able to tell who consistently missed work\n(53).\nIt can be argued that attendance behavior might be improved if\neach employee knew just where they stood at all times within\nattendance policies. Perhaps they would take the steps necessary to\navoid falling into progressive discipline\n\nif they knew they were approaching such status. Some managers\nnoted, however, that employees with the worst attendance records\nknow their status in the attendance policies all too well, and could\nteach classes on how to \"beat the system.\" Ten agencies noted that\nthey made information on employees' status within attendance\npolicies easily available. In most cases, this meant that employees\ncould obtain a copy of their record from their supervisor. However,\none agency noted that all employees could access their standing in\nthe attendance policies via computers in the drivers' lounge by\nentering their employee identification number.\nReceiving Employee Input on the Causes of Absenteeism\nCommunication is a two-way street. It is important for transit\nagencies to take proactive steps to inform their employees of the\nimportance of good attendance, but it is equally important for\nemployees to have the opportunity to advise the agency on what they\nbelieve might be causing absenteeism. Only 14 of 36 agencies\nreported that they discuss the causes of absenteeism with their\nemployees. Virtually every agency that did explained that\ncommunications occurred on a one-to-one basis with employees\nwhen they have reached the progressive discipline stage and\ncounseling is required. Agencies frequently try to find out what is\ncausing the excessive absenteeism of that particular employee to\ndetermine if there is anything that the agency can do to help the\nemployee\nimprove\ntheir\nattendance.\nThis\nmight\ninclude\nrecommending a visit to the EAP, or changing the work shift of the\nindividual (with union consent.) One of the essential elements for\nsuccess in managing absenteeism is the employer's genuine,\nconsistent effort to help employees overcome their absenteeism\nproblems. Employees often have nonattendance related problems that\nfrequently result in absenteeism. Absenteeism may be a symptom,\nnot the cause of the problem (6.3).\nThe project investigators were hoping to determine if any\nagency had taken steps to learn the causes of absenteeism by going to\nthe source (employees) through some form of accepted research.\nOnly one agency reported that they hired a consultant who conducted\nfocus groups with bus operators to help identify the reasons for\nabsenteeism from the employees' point of view. Insights gained from\nthese sessions are summarized in chapter 2 and should prove to be\nextremely helpful to any transit agency that wishes to appropriately\naddress excess absenteeism.\nModifying Agency Procedures to Attract and Hire\nNew Bus Operators\nIt might not be difficult to find and/or attract candidates for bus\noperator positions when unemployment is relatively\nhigh and the economy is weak; however, at this time, these\nconditions don't exist in many areas in the United States. As noted in\nchapter 1, transit agencies find themselves in a very competitive\nmarketplace for employees. Millions of jobs are being created\nnationwide. Eric Witcher, Manager of Human Resources of\nCommunity Transit in Lynnwood, Washington, has found that\nunemployed people in the Pacific Northwest are only out of work an\naverage of 30 days or less. He believes that transit agencies must\nincrease the frequency and diversity of recruiting efforts to help\nensure employee availability. In a marketplace that is moving as fast\nas the American economy, transit agencies must try to keep up with\nthe market or be left behind in the search for human resources.\nAt the American Public Transit Association Bus Conference,\nheld in Cleveland, Ohio, in May 1999, a session on \"How to Attract\nEmployees to Transit\" was moderated by Marnie Slakey of Pierce\nTransit. After excellent presentations by panelists from Houston\nMetro, Community Transit, and Tri-Met (Portland, Oregon), the floor\nwas opened for comments and questions from the dozens of transit\nagency representatives hoping to learn some new techniques to\nimprove their recruiting efforts. A number of techniques being used\nby different transit agencies are described here:\n-\nRecruiting is being done on a far more frequent basis. Where\nagencies once recruited for new bus operators only two to three\ntimes a year, some agencies are recruiting every 2 months, or\neven on a continuing basis. This is necessary because of the\nmultiple job opportunities that exist for candidates. Candidates\ncannot be expected to wait for a \"new class\" to be hired when\nthey are likely to find other opportunities in the interim. This\nrequires transit agencies to reduce their class size and possibly\nmodify the way they instruct new classes.\n-\nOne transit agency has increased the speed of the hiring process\nby foregoing job interviews and relying on employee selection\ninstruments to determine whom they will hire. They have faith\nin the predictive ability of the selection instruments (such as\nthose described in the beginning of chapter 3), and they note\nthat it saves the valuable time it takes to arrange their own staff\nand the candidates for interviews.\n-\nAnother way to reduce the time it takes to hire new employees\nis to conduct a \"marathon day\" at job fairs, where candidates\ntake written tests, have physicals, and are interviewed all in 1\nday. Assuming the candidates pass these tests, a conditional\noffer of employment is made that same day. Screening of\nreferences, driving records, and criminal background checks are\ncompleted as quickly as possible.\n\n-\nTransit agencies are currently reviewing their competitiveness\nwith respect to the pay and benefits of other employers in their\narea. Some transit agencies are modifying their pay and\nbenefits to be more competitive. Those agencies that find that\nthey are indeed competitive are being more assertive in\npromoting their relatively good pay, benefits, and stability.\nOther agencies reported that they are asking their bus operators\nwhat they like about the job to ensure that they emphasize such\nfactors when trying to attract candidates. Tri-Met will be\nconducting focus groups to try to determine why employees\nleave.\n-\nTransit agencies are using their unique resources to their best\nadvantage when recruiting employees. Some are using the\ninterior and exterior of their buses (including the electronic\nheadsign at the front of the bus) to advertise the fact they are\nhiring. In a similar fashion, some agencies are hanging huge\nbanners from their facilities, which are visible from adjacent\nroads Others noted that they have placed balloons around signs\nat the front of their properties that announce that they are\nhiring. One agency reported using some of their best bus\noperators at job fairs or malls to help promote the agency and\nthe job. They find that the agency's credibility is increased if\nsomeone who is actually performing the job speaks to\nemployee candidates. Whenever possible, minority bus\noperators are used to represent the agency when they recruit in\nminority communities.\n-\nTransit agencies can be more effective in their search for new\nemployees by advertising in media that serves the most likely\nsource of candidates. In some areas this results in concentrated\nadvertising in newspapers read primarily by minorities or\nimmigrants. In other areas it has resulted in working with\nhuman service agencies that are helping people increase their\nemployment skills. Houston Metro offers a general education\ndegree (GED) program for those without a high school\ndiploma. Houston Metro will hire a candidate, help the\nemployee prepare for their test, and give them 1 year to secure\ntheir GED.\nSummary of Management Interventions\nThe management interventions cited in this section tend to emphasize\nthe human side of the transit agency enterprise. Many of the\nstrategies are geared toward recognizing employees as people with\nneeds for interaction, involvement, and the ability to have some\ncontrol over their work environment. These strategies are clearly\nconsistent with the findings of Coffman and Buckingham, who spent\n5 years reviewing surveys conducted by the Gallup Organization.\nUsing a massive amount of data--surveys of 1\nmillion employees and 85,000 managers over 25 years--they found\nthat there is a direct link between the most productive workers and\ngreater company profits, more satisfied and loyal customers and\nlower employee turnover (64). The surveys asked employees 150\nquestions about 18 aspects of their work, their attitudes toward it, and\ntheir workplace conditions (65). They found that the key to employee\nsatisfaction is that employee's relationship with his/her immediate\nsupervisor. The research shows that the best employees or business\nunits tend to share the following perceptions (64):\n-\nI know what is expected of me at work.\n-\nI have the materials and equipment I need to do my work\nright.\n-\nAt work, I have the opportunity to do what I do best every\nday.\n-\nIn the last 7 days, I have received recognition or praise for\ndoing good work.\n-\nMy supervisor, or someone at work, seems to care about\nme as a person.\n-\nThere is someone at work who encourages my\ndevelopment.\n-\nAt work, my opinions seem to count.\n-\nThe mission/purpose of my company makes me feel my\njob is important.\n-\nMy associates (fellow employees) are committed to doing\ngood work.\n-\nI have a best friend at work.\n-\nIn the last 6 months, someone has talked to me about my\nprogress.\n-\nThis last year, I have had opportunities at work to learn\nand grow.\nWorth noting was that pay and perks were not as important to\nemployees. They matter to every employee, but are not the factors\nthat give employers the edge with good employees (65). Daecher\nalso stresses the significance of these factors when he encourages\nemployers of vehicle operators to \"Make sure policies and\nprocedures are in place, and give drivers RESPECT. When the\norganization encourages them to give input, you will have better,\nhappier drivers\" (5).\nOne strategy used to reduce absenteeism at a nonprofit\nresidential program for children with autism helps demonstrate the\nimportance of personalizing the workplace. Twenty-one staff\nmembers participated in the study, which was evaluated through the\nuse of a multiple baseline across three individual group homes.\nDuring baseline conditions, employees reported their unscheduled\nabsences to an individual whose only responsibility to the\norganization, aside from some part-time clerical work, was to arrange\nsubstitute coverage for staff who were absent. Under treatment\nconditions, the additional requirement of having employees notify an\nimmediate supervisor in the event of\n\nan unscheduled absence was imposed. The procedure reduced the use\nof unscheduled leave by 56 percent, 66 percent, and 35 percent in\nhomes one, two, and three, respectively (66).\nAs one of the bus operators in the focus groups stated, \"If you\nshow me you care a little about me, I'll bend over backward for you.\"\nOne mid-sized agency's executive director noted that he visits any\nemployee who has been hospitalized as a result of an on-the-job\ninjury or other\ntraumatic event, to assure the employee that the agency will do\neverything possible to assist the employee during that difficult time.\nThis greater effort toward personalizing work relationships appears\nto be quite effective--director's agency enjoys an extremely low rate\nof absenteeism. In simple terms, there is a realization that a quid-pro\nquo is always in effect, whereby the more managers show they care\nfor their employees, the more likely the employees will provide the\nmaximum effort for their employer.\n\nCHAPTER FOUR\nCONCLUSIONS\nEmployee availability is an issue with which many transit agencies\nstruggle. The causes of employee shortages and absenteeism are\nvaried. Some causes can be controlled by a transit agency; some are\ngenerated by the external environment that is beyond a transit\nagency's ability to control, but not beyond their ability to adapt to;\nsome causes need to be bargained over with organized labor, whereas\nother causes are generated by fundamental aspects of human\nbehavior that might or might not be successfully addressed by transit\nagencies. Based on this synthesis review of the state of the art, there\nappears to be a number of actions a transit agency can take to help\nensure employee availability and avoid excessive absenteeism.\nThe use of customized surveys and tests that enable transit\nagencies to develop profiles of bus operator candidates makes good\nsense and has shown positive results in the few agencies where\nanalysis has been performed. Transit agencies should strongly\nconsider investing in such selection instruments to increase their\nchances of getting the best candidates possible because the basic\nwork ethic and character of an employee appears to affect\nabsenteeism. The value of these instruments increases as competition\nfor good employees becomes more intense in a current \"employees'\nmarket,\" and as previous employers become more reluctant to share\ninformation about applicants' previous work records. Agencies that\nutilize such instruments indicate that they are more satisfied with\ntheir level of absenteeism than those agencies that do not.\nTransit agencies can increase their chances of improving the\nhealth of their employees by means of wellness programs, health\nscreenings, ergonomic equipment, and training programs that\nemphasize safety and accident prevention. Although the benefits of\nthese programs are difficult to measure, they are clearly positive,\nassist those who wish to stay as healthy as possible, and provide an\nopportunity to emphasize the agency's goals for attendance.\nEAPs help employees cope with a multitude of problems and\ncan help them better balance their job responsibilities and their\npersonal problems. The one transit agency that reported providing a\nday care center at its operating facility could not quantify its\ncost/benefit in terms of absenteeism. However, they believe it has\nhelped reduce absenteeism, increased employee morale, and\nimproved employee availability because it makes the agency a more\nattractive place of employment.\nAlthough opinions vary greatly on the effectiveness of financial\nincentives for better attendance, there appear to be encouraging\ntrends that help to identify when incentives work best.\n-\nAgencies that offer larger cash awards report greater\nsuccess with their incentive programs. Larger awards\nwould logically seem to have more impact on behavior.\n-\nPerhaps just as importantly, agencies that are offering\ntheir awards based on quarterly performance are having\ngreater success. This time frame is much more achievable\nfor employees and gives them goals more easily reached.\nOne agency still uses a year as their measure for\nperformance, but allows employees to have as many as\nfour occurrences of absence and still qualify for a\nsubstantial good attendance bonus.\n-\nTransit agencies that use lotteries for cash prizes or\ncertificates have found them to be popular and successful\nin reducing absenteeism.\n-\nThere is more support for paying employees for unused\nsick leave at the end of the year than for paying out sick\nleave upon retirement.\nMost transit agencies provide their employees with a\nconsiderable amount of flexibility in the use of annual leave. Many\ntransit agencies allow their operators and mechanics to select some\nportion of their annual vacations in daily increments, and work with\nthem whenever possible to grant use of annual leave on a daily basis\nwith at least some minimal amount of notice. Almost one-half of all\nagencies surveyed allow employees to swap days off with another\nemployee with similar work hours. Virtually every agency agreed\nthat these provisions help minimize absenteeism to a small degree\nand help foster better rapport between managers and rank and file\nemployees.\nTransit agencies usually must bargain with their unions on how\nabsenteeism is controlled. Not surprisingly, tighter controls tend to\ndiscourage excessive absenteeism. If transit agencies want to\nimplement stricter controls over the use of sick leave, they will most\nlikely have to pay for this right through the bargaining process.\nThere is disagreement over whether requiring employees to\naccrue substantial amounts of sick leave before getting\n\nconsensus on the fairness and effectiveness of denying the first day\nof sick leave time after an employee has been absent a certain\nnumber of times during the past 12 months.\nActive monitoring of absence, combined with consistent\napplication of progressive discipline, is regarded as the single most\neffective way to minimize excess absenteeism. It is surprising how\noften agencies admit they do not do a good job in this area. Agencies\nthat dedicate personnel to doing nothing but this function, and live by\na \"no tolerance\" policy toward excessive absenteeism, have enjoyed\ngood results. Consistent auditing of the authenticity of doctors'\ncertificates has also paid big dividends to transit agencies in reducing\nabsenteeism.\nPositive discipline programs are being used in more workplaces\nin an attempt to treat employees as responsible adults, avoid bitter\nfeelings, and minimize absenteeism caused by employees serving\nsuspensions.\nTransit managers are not only attempting to use \"carrot and\nstick\" approaches (incentives and penalties), some are also realizing\nthat transit employees need to feel more involved in their agency.\nAgencies that use Group Supervision programs have a noticeably\nlower rate of absenteeism than those that don't. The single agency\nthat engaged in substantial organizational culture change, where a\nnew vision statement was developed and implemented with the full\nparticipation of employees from every level of the organization,\nrealized a decrease in absenteeism of more than 10 percent. Transit\nagencies that make the extra effort to personalize their relationships\nwith employees and respond assertively to their needs have found\nthat \"what goes around, comes around.\" Employees in such agencies\nare more likely to be willing to give the essential effort all agencies\nneed to succeed.\nThe competition for employees in many regions of the country\nthat are experiencing nearly full employment is affecting transit\nagencies' ability to attract and retain good employees. Many agencies\nare questioning the efficiency of using part-time bus operators as the\nnumber and quality of applicants for such jobs decrease. Others are\nincreasing the wages and benefits they offer to new part-time\nemployees as they experience turnover rates as high as 50 percent.\nOne entrepreneurial transit agency has managed to establish itself as\na provider of other public services (street sweeping, street light\nmaintenance, graffiti removal, etc.) and provides their part-time bus\noperators with the first opportunities to earn extra income and\nbenefits by working at these services.\nTransit agencies also have to deal with what many regard as a\nnew attitude toward work and loyalty to employers. Many transit\nmanagers detect a new generation of employees that don't regard\ntransit as a long-term career because they have been accustomed to\nseeing massive layoffs and hearing that they will change careers up\nto six times in their lives. The younger generation seems to have a\ngreater need to balance their lives between work and leisure time\nthan the previous generation. In addition to this, more households are\nnow characterized by two working parents or an unmarried single\nworking parent with young children. Family responsibilities were\nrated as the second most significant reason for absence from work.\nOne agency states that all transit systems have to reassess what they\nregard as a reasonable attendance standard given these new realities.\nThey suggest that minimizing excessive absenteeism is a more\nrealistic goal than expecting perfect attendance.\nThe following items could be the subject of future study:\n-\nA number of transit agencies are actively considering\ninstituting day care services at their facilities. This report\nfound only one agency currently providing such services\n(VIA in San Antonio, Texas). That agency subsidizes the\ncost of the child care center at a level of approximately\n$100,000 per year. Future study should determine if that\ncost is recaptured through reduced absenteeism.\n-\nEstablishing an effective communication program is one\nof the biggest challenges to transit agencies that typically\noperate 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, from multiple\nfacilities, with a large work force that operates in the field\nand rarely sees their fellow workers. If establishing a\nmore personal relationship with all employees were vital\nto reducing absenteeism, then the transit industry would\nbe well served by identifying best practices in\norganizational communications.\n-\nDetailed case studies of public and private transit agencies\nwith low absenteeism might be conducted to determine\nwhat strategies and/or conditions they have in place that\nmight be duplicated by other agencies. Surveys of\nemployees might be undertaken to determine the\ncorrelation between job satisfaction and absenteeism at\nthese agencies.\n-\nMore analysis on the long-term impact of customized\nemployee selection instruments needs to be conducted to\ndetermine the cost-benefit of these tools.\n\nREFERENCES\n1.\nEvans, G.W., \"Working on the Hot Seat: Urban Bus\nOperators,\" Accident Analysis and Prevention, Vol. 26, No. 2,\n1994, pp. 181-193.\n2.\nBus Operator Productivity and Efficiency Analysis, Center for\nUrban Transportation Research, University of South Florida,\nTampa, Fla., September 1994.\n3.\nJacobs, R. and J.

We print schedules that tell our customers where\nand when they can catch their bus. We are committed to have a particular bus on a particular route\nat a particular time to get them to their destination. What Pierce Transit never wants to tell a\ncustomer is the reason that bus did not show up is that we had no operator to put in the\nseat. That's where relief operators come in.\nRelief Operators at Pierce Transit cover vacancies created by full time operators, because the full\ntime operator is on vacation, sick, in training or off for whatever reason. Sometimes we get\nadvance notice that a full time operator will be off, which makes it easy for the dispatcher to fill\nthe work.. Other times we get only an hour's notice or in the worse case scenario, no notice at all.\nRelief Operators never know until 3:00 p.m. of any given day - what their schedule will be for the\nfollowing day. This makes scheduling your personal life difficult. It is important that you have\nflexible daycare arrangements and your family is aware of the demands of this job.\nOur first run signs up at 3:31 a.m. and our last run gets in at 1:11 a.m. So, there are only a couple\nof hours a day that Pierce Transit does not have buses on the road. As a relief operator, you may\nbe the one to start at 3:31 a.m. or the one to get off at 1:11 a.m. Relief operators do not have a\nchoice as to which shift they will work, or what routes they will drive. Assignments vary greatly,\nincluding straight 8 hour shifts, split shifts and shifts less than 8 hours. Traditionally during a split\nshift you would work two to four hours in the morning, then are off for a few hours and work the\nremainder of your shift in the afternoon. We also have what we call \"trippers.\" These are two to\nfour hour pieces of work. You could be assigned two or three \"trippers\" in any given day.\n\nLet's pretend now that you are a relief operator and it is now after 3:00 p.m. You check with the\ndispatcher to find out what your assignment is for tomorrow. The dispatcher informs you that all\nyou have for tomorrow is a 3 hour piece of work. You are told to report at 6:00 am and that you\nwill be finished at 9:00 am. You are happy about the assignment because you have been putting in\nquite a few hours lately and feel like you need a break. The weather tomorrow is supposed to be\nnice and sunny and you decide to call a few friends and plan to meet them at the beach at 9:30 am.\nYou go to bed that night and set your alarm to give you plenty of time to arrive before 6:00 am. At\nabout 3:00 am your phone rings. It is the dispatcher. A lot has happened since you called in\nyesterday to get your assignment. Several operators have gone sick and now the dispatcher is busy\njuggling work. You are informed that your shift is being changed and instead of coming in at 6:00\nam, you are needed at 5:14 a.m. Also, instead of only working three hours, you will now be\nworking eight. There go all your plans! Another way this could play out is that you do not get the\ncall at 3:00 am and come to work for your three hour shift as originally assigned. You get back to\nthe garage at 9:00 am and are in high spirits. You turn in your work assignment at the dispatch\nwindow and the dispatcher says to you, \"Bus 215 is out in the lot, running and ready. I need you to\nget in it and drive for another five hours. The bus should have left the lot 10 minutes ago.\" As a\nrelief operator, you are expected to work this additional time. The bottom line is, it is very difficult\nto schedule your private life around what is expected of you at Pierce Transit.\nIn addition to being trained on our regular \"fixed route\" buses, you will also be trained in our\nSpecialized Transportation SHUTTLE buses. Our SHUTTLE service is a door to door van service\nfor the disabled community. Many of our SHUTTLE customers use mobility devices such as\ncanes, walkers or wheelchairs. Some customers have difficulty communicating because of their\ndisability. In SHUTTLE, an operator often has direct contact with the customer, assisting in their\nboarding or deboarding and walking them to and from the door. Unlike fixed route service, where\nan operator follows a specific route, SHUTTLE operators are given a name and address and it is\nup to the operator to find it. (Map reading is part of your training.) It takes a special person to\nwork in SHUTTLE because of the individual needs of our disabled customers.\n\n_______________________________________\n______________________\nRelief operators are guaranteed twenty hours of work each week. This is not to say that you won't\nwork 50 or so hours in a given week. It all depends on the workload, or the amount of vacancies\ncreated by the full time operators. There is no guarantee as to when you will move to a full time\noperator. Movement to full time is based on how many people retire, quit, are terminated, or get\npromoted. It also depends on the addition of service. Movement to full time is done according to\nseniority.\nWe expect our relief operators to be available for work. That doesn't mean that you have to sit by\nyour phone 24 hours a day waiting for the dispatcher to call you. However, in the past, we had\nrelief operators that were using their answering machines as screening devices. The dispatcher\nwould call, leave a message and the operator would not call back. This was happening whether or\nnot they were home. It became difficult to fill work. Remember the commitment we have to the\npublic? Pierce Transit instituted a call-in policy. Today, relief operators on two of their weekends\nper month, are assigned a call-in time. If the dispatcher has work at that time, the relief operator is\nexpected to come to work. If the dispatcher does not have work, the relief operator is then free to\ndo whatever they want for the remainder of the day.\nRelief operator hours are equalized. That means the relief operator with the highest seniority and\nthe one with the lowest seniority are going to get about the same number of hours per payperiod.\nThat's not to say that if we need an operator now the dispatcher won't take whoever is available\nrather than call the person with the least hours.\nAfter hearing our expectations of relief operators, is this something you would like to do?\nSignature\nDate\n\nAPPENDIX E\nBroward County Transit: Operations Rules and Regulations and Operator's Manual\n\n10. Operator Shift Swaps\nOccasionally it becomes necessary for Operators to be absent from work due to court appearances, family\nmatters, or other personal reasons. Swapping of shifts with another Bus Operator would enable an Operator to\nswitch shifts with another Operator at the same facility and therefore not lose pay for the necessary absence.\na.\nMembers of the bargaining unit, except probationary employees in training, shall have the right to request a\nrun/shift exchange by means of a form provided by the County, which both parties to the exchange must\ncomplete and sign. The completed form must be presented to the Superintendent or designee for approval.\nRequests for exchanges must be made a minimum of seventy-two (72) hours in advance. In case of a\ndocumentable emergency, approval nay be granted with less than seventy-two (72) hours at the discretion\nof the Superintendent.\nb. The maximum numbers of exchanges allowable for any bargaining unit member shall not exceed five (5)\nexchanges per calendar year for an Operator initiating the request. All run/shift exchange for \"picking\npurposes\" (other than partial runs) will need to be documented and will be deducted from the maximum\nnumber of five (5) swaps. The run/shift exchange cannot be used in conjunction with a scheduled vacation.\nc.\nAny employee on duty by virtue of a run/shift exchange shall be entitled to the same benefits, privileges,\nand protections and shall assume the same responsibilities as any on-duty personnel. Repayment of a\nrun/shift exchange is the responsibility of the employee.\nd. A replacement who leaves work early because of illness shall have the sick leave deducted from his./her\nbank and not from the bank accrued by the employee originally assigned to the run/shift, otherwise, payroll\ncomputations will not be affected by run/shift exchanges.\ne.\nA run/shift exchange constitutes an even exchange and neither party becomes eligible for overtime pay\nbecause of the exchange. Each employee will be credited as if they had worked their normal schedule.\nf.\nAn employee who abuses this procedure shall be subject to the loss of the right to run/shift exchange for the\nperiod of one (1) year. Any member of the bargaining unit who agrees to run/shift exchange, but reports\nsick for the agreed exchange, must provide doctor's lines to verify the illness. All sick reporting, or booking\noff a run must be done in accordance with existing policies. An employee who fails to provide doctor's\nlines or otherwise fails to report to work the agreed run/shift shall be subject to disciplinary action.\nMembers of the bargaining unit are encouraged to police the practice themselves with the operational needs\nof the County, as well as the practical needs of their bargaining unit members in mind.\n\ng. Both affected Operators must submit paper work (as shown in Section VI,O) to the Superintendent for\napproval at least seventy-two (72) hours in advance of the run/shift exchange.\nh. Both Operators involved will be responsible for operating their new temporary assignment. Either\nemployee involved in the run/shift exchange will be subject to all regular rules and regulations that govern\nnormal operations.\ni.\nBoth run exchanges must occur within a sixty (60) day period and must happen within the same calendar\nyear.\n\nAPPLICANT:_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\nBROWARD COUNTY MASS TRANSIT DIVISION\nRUN EXCHANGE REQUEST/AUTHORIZATION\nYEAR _ _ _ _ __ _ _ _ _ _\nEXCHANGE # _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\nMAXIMUM OF 5\n*NOTE: BOTH run exhanges must occur within a sixty (60) day period.\nREPLACEMENT\nI am eligible and hereby obligate myself to perform all run assignment duties of applicant for the specific period noted below in\napplicant section:\nPRINT NAME OF REPLACEMENT_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\nDAY:_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\nDATE:_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\nRUN:_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ REPORT TIME:_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ REPORT LOCATION:_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\nI understand that I am not eligible for RDO work on exchange date.\nAPPLICANT\nI am eligible and hereby obligate myself to perform all run assignment duties of replacement for the specific period noted above\nin replacement section:\nPRINT NAME OF APPLICANT:_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\nDAY:_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\nDATE:_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\nRUN #_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ REPORT TIME:_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ REPORT LOCATION:_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\nSignature of Applicant:_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\nDate:_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\nSignature of Replacement:_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\nDate:_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\nRECOMMEND APPROVAL:_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\nSuperintendent Signature\nDate:_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\nc: Applicant\nReplacement\nPayroll\nFile\n\nAPPENDIX F\nTARC Attendance Policy\nTARC ATTENDANCE POLICY\nRev 1.0\nA. INTRODUCTION AND PURPOSE\nRegular attendance is essential to the effective operation of TARC, and to our commitment to provide high\nquality, dependable service to our customers. It is the expectation of TARC that each member of our team will be\navailable for scheduled work on a consistent basis.\nFrom time to time, an employee may have an illness, disability, or other valid reason that prevents\nattendance at work. The TARC Attendance Policy allows for these infrequent occurrences. As an incentive to\nexceed the standards of this policy, the labor agreement provides a financial reward for those who achieve perfect\nattendance.\nThe TARC Attendance Policy is intended to support the objective of regular attendance. It includes a series\nof disciplinary steps that bring to the employee's attention the fact that he/she is exceeding acceptable absence\nlevels, provides counseling regarding steps that can be taken for improvement, and describes the consequences of\nfailure to improve attendance.\nB. DEFINITIONS\nExcused Absence: Absence from scheduled work supported by adequate explanation, documentation, or a\nphysician's statement delivered to the employee's immediate supervisor upon return to work. Whenever an employee\nhas been absent for more than three (3) consecutive workdays, a physician's statement is required in order for the\nabsences to be considered excused. At TARC's discretion, a physician's statement may be required for absences on a\nscheduled workday immediately before or after a holiday or vacation, in order for such absences to be considered\nexcused.\nUnexcused Absence: Absence from scheduled work that is either; (1) not supported by adequate explanation,\ndocumentation, or a physician's statement, (2) not supported in a timely manner as described above, (3) inadequately\nsupported, or, (4) for any other reason not considered excused in Exhibit \"A.\"\nVerified Disability/Long-Term Illness or Injury: A continuous period of absence for a disabling medical reason of\nmore than ten (10)\nworking days, or, a continuous period of absence of any length requiring hospitalization, or, a\ncontinuous absence of any length for outpatient surgery, that is documented by a properly completed physician's\nstatement delivered to the Human Resources Department at any time during the period of absence or upon return to\nwork.\n\nVerified Worker's Compensation: A period of absence attributable to a work injury supported by a physician's\nstatement from a designated treating physician, a physician seen on referral from a designated treating physician, or\na physician designated by TARC.\nRolling Year: A fifty-two (52) week period of active employment, ending with the Saturday of the week in which\nthe most recent period of absence occurred. A rolling year is fifty-two (52) consecutive weeks unless interrupted by\nan approved leave or worker's compensation absence of ten (10) or more working days.\nPhysician's Statement: A statement from a licensed physician, osteopath, dentist, or chiropractor that includes the\nemployee's name, diagnosis, dates of disability, and signature of physician or dentist. A rubber-stamp signature is\nacceptable. However, TARC may verify the authenticity of any statement as it deems necessary. In situations where\nconfidentiality of diagnosis is necessary, the statement should indicate to whom Human Resources staff may direct\ninquiries to confirm the necessity for the absence.\nC. CATEGORIES OF ABSENCE\nTARC recognizes three major categories of absence. These are:\nCategory A: Scheduled or Contractual Absence\n1. Vacations\n2. Paid Holidays\n3. Jury Duty\n4. Approved Leave, e.g., Funeral, Military, Maternity, FMLA, Union, etc.\n5. Suspensions\n6. Union Business\nCategory B: Long-Term or Non-Recurring Absence\n1. Verified Disability/Long-Term Illness or Injury\n2. Verified Worker's Compensation\nCategory C: Recurring or Excessive Absence\n1. Excused Absence\n2. Unexcused Absence\n3. Loseouts/Tardiness/Late to Report\n4. Personal Reasons\n5. Any Other Absence Not Qualifying as Category A or B\n\nD. POINT SYSTEM\n(1) Treatment of Absence Categories\nA point system will provide a progressive program for handling absences and loseouts/tardies/late to report.\nAbsences are treated as follows:\na.\nCategory A absences will not count toward points that result in disciplinary steps.\nb. Category B absences will not count toward points that result in disciplinary steps.\nc.\nCategory C absences will count toward points that result in disciplinary steps.\n(2) Accumulation of Points\nPoints are accumulated during a \"rolling year\".\n(3) Point Values of Absences/Credits\nExcused absences\nEach full workday ..................................................................1 point\nEach partial workday .............................................................1⁄2 point\nUnexcused absences\nEach full workday ..................................................................2 points\nEach partial workday .............................................................1 point\nLoseout/Tardy/Late to report\n(work run or other assignment) ...........................................1⁄2 point\nLoseout/Tardy/Late to report\n(did not work run or other assignment) ..............................1 point\nCredit for month of perfect attendance ..........................................1 point\nE. PROGRESSIVE DISCIPLINARY STEPS\nThe three step procedure outlined below will apply to the accumulation of points during a \"rolling year.\"\nStep 1: Counseling\nAfter accumulating ten (10) points, an employee will be notified, in writing, of the number of points\naccumulated and counseled as to subsequent disciplinary steps that will result from continued absences.\n\nStep 2: Probation\nAfter accumulating fifteen (15) points, an employee will be notified, in writing, of the number of\npoints accumulated, counseled, and placed on probation. He/she will be advised that discharge may result from\ncontinued absences.\nStep 3: Discharge\nAfter accumulating twenty (20) points, an employee will be subject to termination based on a\ncomplete review of the individual's employment record, including but not limited to the employee's attendance\nrecord for the two (2) years prior to the start date of the rolling year.\nF.\nGENERAL\n1.\nCredits for Perfect Attendance: A \"credit\" of one point will be granted for perfect attendance in any\none calendar month within the rolling year. Perfect attendance shall mean that the employee is not absent or tardy\nduring the month, that the employee actually performed a work assignment, and missed no scheduled work due to\ndiscipline. Absences for union business or contractual paid absences for vacations, holidays, jury duty, or funerals\nwill not negate the credit for that month.\n2.\nAbsences Involving \"Ask Off's\" in Transportation Department: From time to time, there is an excess of\noperators to perform the required work. Operators who \"ask off' and are granted permission or are offered the\nopportunity to be off under these circumstances will not be assessed Category C absence or points under this policy.\n3.\nDiscipline Code: There are several areas of the Discipline Code where disciplinary actions are\nstipulated for absence or tardiness (e.g. AWOL, loseouts, etc.). This policy has been developed with no suspension\nsteps so that the employee would not be subject to a double penalty for the same absence. However, each employee\nis subject to the penalties outlined in the Discipline Code should those specific rules be violated.\n4.\nAttendance Record: Upon request, an employee may review or obtain a copy of his/her attendance\nrecord.\n5.\nEffective Date: This policy is effective January 5, 1997, and subsequently revised on July 12, 1998. It\nis subject to change upon written notice to employees. Contemplated changes first will be discussed with the proper\nunion representatives.\n\nI\nEXHIBIT \"A\"\nCLASSIFICATION OF CATEGORY C ABSENCE\nEXCUSED\n1.\nS - Sick\nA.

The TRB incorporates all former HRB activities and also performs additional functions under a broader\nscope involving all modes of transportation and the interactions of transportation with society. The Board's purpose is to\nstimulate research concerning the nature and performance of transportation systems, to disseminate information that the research\nproduces, and to encourage the application of appropriate research findings. The Board's program is carried out by more than 270\ncommittees, task forces, and panels composed of more than 3,300 administrators, engineers, social scientists, attorneys,\neducators, and others concerned with transportation; they serve without compensation. The program is supported by state\ntransportation and highway departments, the modal administrations of the U.S. Department of Transportation, the Association of\nAmerican Railroads, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, and other organizations and individuals interested in\nthe development of transportation.\nThe National Academy of Sciences is a private, nonprofit, self-perpetuating society of distinguished scholars engaged in\nscientific and engineering research, dedicated to the furtherance of science and technology and to their use for the general\nwelfare. Upon the authority of the charter granted to it by the Congress in 1863, the Academy has a mandate that requires it to\nadvise the federal government on scientific and technical matters. Dr Bruce Alberts is president of the National Academy of\nSciences.\nThe National Academy of Engineering was established in 1964, under the charter of the National Academy of Sciences, as a\nparallel organization of outstanding engineers It is autonomous in its administration and in the selection of its members, sharing\nwith the National Academy of Sciences the responsibility for advising the federal government. The National Academy of\nEngineering also sponsors engineering programs aimed at meeting national needs, encourages education and research, and\nrecognizes the superior achievements of engineers. Dr. Robert M.White is president of the National Academy of Engineering.\nThe Institute of Medicine was established in 1970 by the National Academy of Sciences to secure the services of eminent\nmembers of appropriate professions in the examination of policy matters pertaining to the health of the public. The Institute acts\nunder the responsibility given to the National Academy of Sciences by its congressional charter to be an adviser to the federal\ngovernment and, upon its own initiative, to identify issues of medical care, research, and education. Dr. Kenneth\nI. Shine is president of the Institute of Medicine.\nThe National Research Council was organized by the National Academy of Sciences in 1916 to associate the broad\ncommunity of science and technology with the Academy's purposes of furthering knowledge and advising the federal\ngovernment. Functioning in accordance with general policies determined by the Academy, the Council has become the principal\noperating agency of both the National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Engineering in providing services to\nthe government, the public, and the scientific and engineering communities The Council is administered jointly by both\nAcademies and the Institute of Medicine. Dr. Bruce Alberts and Dr. Robert M. White are chairman and vice chairman,\nrespectively, of the National Research Council."

This report is intended to\nassist those involved in the planning, design,\noperation, and maintenance of LRT systems by\nproviding a consistent set of guidelines and standards\nfor LRT operations through higher speed LRT\ncrossings.\nThis report discusses findings from research\nperformed under TCRP Project A-13, Light Rail\nService: Vehicular and Pedestrian Safety. TCRP\nProject A-13 research addresses the safety and\noperating experience of LRT systems with LRVs\noperating on semi-exclusive rights-of-way at speeds\ngreater than 55 km/h (35 mph). The analysis in this\nreport reflects interviews with LRT agency officials,\nfield observations, and analysis of accident records\nand accident rates at 11 LRT systems in the United\nStates and Canada. The 11 systems--Baltimore,\nCalgary\n(Canada),\nDallas,\nDenver,\nEdmonton\n(Canada),\nLos\nAngeles,\nPortland,\nSt.\nLouis,\nSacramento, San Diego, and San Jose--represent a\nbroad range of current LRT operating practices and\nsituations.\nFor simplicity of discussion and analysis, the\nresearch\nteam\nclassified\nthe\nnumerous\nLRT\nalignments into categories based on similar conflict\nconditions between LRVs and motor vehicles,\nbicycles, and pedestrians (see Table 1). Expanded\ndefinitions\nand\nexamples\nof\nLRT\nalignment\nclassifications can be found in TCRP\nReport 17, \"Integration of Light Rail Transit into City\nStreets.\"\nThe survey of the 11 LRT systems revealed a\nwide variation in operating practices, safety issues\nand concerns, accident experience, and innovative\nsafety features. Because situations and contexts at\nLRT crossings vary, warning systems and traffic\ncontrol devices for LRT crossings also vary from\nsystem to system and among different portions of the\nsame system. This lack of standard treatment and\nuniformity results in confusion and divergent\nexpectations about proper response for safety at LRT\ncrossings. Thus, the research presented in this report\nwill develop a set of uniform traffic and pedestrian\nplanning, design, and control device guidelines based\non use and experience with several innovative safety\nfeatures at each LRT system.\n1 OVERVIEW\nThis report discusses solutions to the issues and\nconcerns raised in Chapter 2 (System Operating and\nSafety Experience) of the final report for TCRP\nProject A-13, Light Rail Service: Vehicular and\nPedestrian Safety. These solutions are aimed at\nreducing the potential for collisions at higher speed\nLRT crossings (where LRVs operate at speeds\ngreater than 55 km/h [35 mph]). Guidelines for\nsystem\ndesign\nand\noperations,\ntraffic\nsignal\npreemption, automatic gate placement, and pedestrian\ncontrol are discussed. The report concludes by\ndescribing effective public education techniques and\ngrade crossing enforcement practices.\nTRANSPORTATION RESEARCH BOARD\nNATIONAL RESEARCH COUNCIL\n\nCONTENTS\nIntroduction, 1\nOverview, 1\nBackground, 3\nSummary of Solutions, 4\nSystem Design and Operations Guidelines, 4\n4.1 System Design Guidelines, 4\n4.2 System Operations and Maintenance Guidelines, 15\nTraffic Signal Preemption Guidelines, 17\n5.1 Definition, 17\n5.2 When to Preempt Traffic Signals, 19\n5.3 Preemption Guidelines, 19\nAutomatic Gate Placement Guidelines, 31\n6.1 Automatic Gate Placement -- Angle, 32\n6.2 Automatic Gate Placement -- Sidewalk/Shoulder, 36\nPedestrian Control Guidelines, 38\nGuidelines for Selecting Among Pedestrian Crossing Control Devices, 44\n8.1 Overview, 44\n8.2 Available Devices, 46\n8.3 Recommended Practice, 50\nEducation and Enforcement Techniques, 52\n9.1 Public Education, 53\n9.2 Staff Training, 54 9.3 Enforcement, 54\n\n____________________\n____________________\nTABLE 1 LRT alignment classification\nSource: Transit Cooperative Research Program, TCRP Report 17, \"Integration of Light Rail Transit\ninto City Streets,\" Transportation Research Board, National Research Council, Washington, D.C. (1996)\np. 2.\nBACKGROUND\nTCRP Report 17, \"Integration of Light Rail Transit\ninto City Streets\"1 focuses on LRT alignment types b.3\nthrough b.5 and c.1 through c.3, where LRVs operate in\nstreets with motor vehicles (and bicycles) or in malls with\npedestrians at speeds less than or equal to 55 km/h (35\nmph). Higher speed LRT crossings (where LRVs operate at\nspeeds greater than 55 km/h [35 mph]) experience fewer\noverall accidents than the street or mall rights-of-way\naddressed in TCRP Report 17. This improved accident\nexperience at LRT crossings along type b.1 and b.2 rights-\nof-way primarily results from the reduced level of\ninteraction between LRVs and motor vehicles, bicycles,\nand pedestrians, as compared with street or mall type\nalignments2.\nHowever, when collisions do occur at crossings along\nalignment types b.1 or b.2, they are often more severe\nbecause of higher LRV speeds. Furthermore, when these\nincidents occur, they may produce problems of public\nimage and transit agency liability, especially in light of the\nrecent\n1Transit Cooperative Research Program, TCRP Report 17, \"Integration of\nLight Rail Transit into City Streets,\" Transportation Research Board,\nNational Research Council, Washington, D C. (1996) p. 64.\n2Accident experience in Texas and in the San Gabriel Valley (California)\nalong similar types of right-of-way using essentially the same types of\nwarning devices (flashing light signals and automatic gates) suggests that\nnon-train collisions (i.e., motor vehicle-motor vehicle accidents at or near\nrailroad crossings) occur more than twice as often as those involving trains\n(i.e.,\nmotor\nvehicle-train\ncollisions).\nTherefore,\nadditional\ndesign\nconsiderations should be implemented to minimize the occurrence of non-\ntrain accidents near crossings. One possible solution explored in this report\nand in Chapter 4 of the Final Report is the use of standard traffic signals in\nlieu of flashing light signals.\ncommuter railroad train-school bus collision in Fox River\nGrove, Illinois3. Thus, from a transit agency's perspective,\nany accident is undesirable. Appropriate actions should be\ntaken during system planning and design to minimize the\npotential for accidents at higher speed LRT crossings.\nThe guidelines presented in this report reflect a\ndetailed analysis of the operating and safety experience of\nthe 11 LRT systems surveyed. Accordingly, they reflect the\nfield reviews of LRT-crossing geometry, traffic control,\nand risky user crossing 4 behavior at the highest accident\nlocations on each of the LRT systems. The guidelines apply\nto retrofits and extensions of existing LRT lines as well as\nto the development of new systems. They enable new\nsystems in the planning and design stages to learn from the\ndesign, operating, and safety experiences of existing\nsystems.\nAll provisions contained in this report apply to LRT-\nonly operations. In some instances, LRT operates in right-\nof-way immediately next to railroad (e.g., commuter and\nfreight) right-of-way, sharing grade crossings, or on the\nsame track as railroad at different times of the day. If both\nLRT and railroads operate through the same grade\ncrossings, some of the recommendations contained in these\nguidelines may not be implementable, especially where\nother railroad-specific regulations apply. However, in\ngeneral, the guidelines represent good design, operations,\nand maintenance\n3For more details on this accident, refer to the National Transportation\nSafety Board's Highway/Railroad Accident Report, Collision of Northeast\nIllinois Regional Commuter Railroad Corporation (METRA) Train and\nTransportation Joint Agreement School District 47/155 School Bus at\nRailroad/Highway Grade Crossing in Fox River Grove, Illinois on October\n29, 1995 (PB96-916202, NTSB/HAR-96/02)\n4Motorists, bicyclists, and/or pedestrians.\n\n____________________\n____________________\npractices for all LRT crossings where LRVs operate at\nspeeds greater than 55 km/h (35 mph).\nFinally, the guidelines assume that the LRT crossing\nin question is equipped with flashing light signals and\nautomatic gates5. Until future research suggests otherwise,\nall LRT crossings where LRVs normally operate at speeds\ngreater than 55 km/h (35 mph) should be controlled by\nautomatic gates. It may be possible to eliminate automatic\ngates and use only flashing light signals or standard traffic\nsignals at an LRT crossing along type b.1 or b.2 right-of\nway where LRVs are accelerating (or decelerating) from\n(or to) an LRT station and the typical crossing speed is less\nthan 55 km/h (35 mph).\nSUMMARY OF SOLUTIONS\nTable 2 presents an overview of the issues and\npotential solutions described in this report. The issues and\nsolutions reflect (1) the accident histories of the 11 LRT\nagencies surveyed, (2) the experience of these agencies in\nsolving these issues, and (3) research team field reviews\nand observed behavior at higher speed LRT crossings.\nSYSTEM DESIGN AND OPERATIONS\nGUIDELINES\nThe following recommendations relate to (1)the\ndesign of a new LRT system (or an extension/retrofit of an\nexisting system) and (2) operating a new (or extended)\nLRT system once constructed.\n4.1 System Design Guidelines\n1.\nAutomatic\nGate\nDrive-Around\nTreatments.\nOn\nroadway approaches to LRT crossings, use raised medians\nwith barrier (non-mountable) curbs where roadway\ngeometry and widths allow. Where raised medians are\ninstalled, bollards6 may be necessary between a double set\nof LRT tracks to discourage motorists from turning through\nthe break in the raised median at the crossing. Most\ncollisions between\n5In 1877, the U.S. Supreme Court in Continental Improvement Company v\n.Stead described the duties, rights, and obligations of railroad companies vis-\na-vis those of the highway user at highway-rail crossings and found that they\nwere \"mutual and reciprocal.\" The Court went on to say that a train has\npreference and right-of-way at crossings because of its 'character,'\n'momentum,' and 'the requirements of public travel by means thereof,' but\nthat the railroad is bound to give due, reasonable, and timely warning of the\ntrain's approach. In light of this ruling, it is considered standard LRT\nindustry practice for LRVs, when traveling at speeds greater than 55 km/h\n(35 mph), to have full priority at crossings. The flashing light signals and\nautomatic gates warn crossing users to yield right-of-way to approaching\nLRVs\n6Bollards are typically steel posts about 1000-mm (40-in.) tall with a\ndiameter of about 200 mm (8 in.).\nLRVs and motor vehicles occur because motorists choose\nto drive around lowered (horizontal) automatic gate arms\n(see Figure 1). However, in some cases it may not be\nphysically possible to install raised roadway medians, such\nas on roadway approaches that are not wide enough to\naccommodate a raised median7 or on roadway approaches\nthat intersect with another roadway (parallel to the tracks)\nimmediately before the LRT crossing.\nFor those approaches to LRT crossings where the\nroadway is not wide enough to construct a raised median\nwith barrier curbs, other traffic channelization devices\nshould be considered. For example, 100-mm (4-in.)-tall\ntraffic dots or 900-mm (36-in.)-tall flexible posts mounted\nalong the double yellow striping in the middle of a narrow\nroadway also discourage motorists from driving around\nlowered automatic gate arms, even though they are more\neasily defeated than a raised median with barrier curbs\n(Figure 2). Raised channelization devices, especially traffic\ndots, should be used with caution in environments where\nsnow or ice is likely, as the dots would be easily removed\nor destroyed by snow plow equipment (flexible posts are\nmore appropriate for this type of environment). At those\ncrossings with an immediately adjacent parallel roadway\nand a high occurrence of vehicles driving around lowered\nautomatic\ngate\narms,\nphoto\nenforcement8\ncould\nsignificantly reduce grade crossing violations and improve\naccident experience (see Section 9 of these guidelines).\nMoreover, because raised medians are not possible\nwith an immediately adjacent parallel roadway, traffic\nturning right or left from this parallel roadway and through\nan LRT crossing should be controlled by one or more of the\nfollowing devices:\n(1) protected (arrow) traffic signal\nindications; (2) LRV-activated no right/left-turn signs (R3\n1, 2)9; (3) automatic gate placement on the crossing\nroadway (this is only applicable if the crossing roadway is\nat an angle other than 90 deg relative to the LRT tracks);\n(4) special right/left-turn automatic gates (on the parallel\nroadway); and/or (5)\n7According to the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices for Streets\nand Highways (U.S Department of Transportation, Federal Highway\nAdministration, Washington, D.C. (1988), Section 5B-2), raised median\nislands should be no less than 4 ft wide In special cases where space is\nlimited, islands may be as narrow as 2 ft, except where used as pedestrian\nrefuge areas Thus, if installing a raised median island on an approach to an\nLRT crossing, the roadway must accommodate a minimum of 2 ft extra\nwidth from face of curb to face of curb.\n8Photo enforcement at grade crossings uses vehicle presence monitoring\n(e.g., loop detectors or video imaging) to detect if a vehicle drives around\nthe tip of a lowered automatic gate arm. If a vehicle is detected by the\nsystem, an image of the vehicle's license plate and driver are captured and\nsent to the state's Department of Motor Vehicles for processing A traffic\ncitation is then issued in the mail.\n9For further information regarding the labeling system for traffic control\ndevices in the United States refer to the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control\nDevices for Streets and Highways (MUTCD), U.S. Department of\nTransportation, Federal Highway Administration, Washington, D.C.

Raised roadway median application.\nflashing light signals aligned for motorists approaching the\nLRT crossing on the parallel roadway.\nControlling left turns from a parallel roadway through\nan LRT crossing is critical. Because motorists on the\nparallel roadway essentially look down the length of the\ngate arm that blocks traffic approaching on the crossing\nroadway, one\nor more of the devices listed above should be installed.\nWithout appropriate control, motorists may unintentionally\ndrive around the tip of the lowered automatic gate arm in\nthe crossing quadrant not blocked. One possible solution, in\naddition to the others listed above, would be to increase the\nvisibility of the automatic gate arm, adding a small,\n\nFigure 2. Example LRT crossing channelization devices.\n\nreflective end plate to its tip as shown in Figure 3. As this\ntype of visibility-enhancing device has not been tested at\nany of the 11 LRT systems surveyed for this study, further\nresearch may be necessary to determine if an end plate is\nreadily implementable.\nAnother possible solution to deterring motorists from\ndriving around the tip of lowered gate arms is installing\nautomatic gates in all four quadrants of the LRT crossing,\nblocking both the entrance (near side) and exit (far side) to\nthe crossing on each roadway approach. Because the exit\nfrom the crossing is also blocked by a gate, motor vehicles\nare essentially unable to drive around the tip of the standard\nautomatic gate arm. Four-quadrant automatic gates are\nmost applicable at crossings where the approach roadway is\nnot wide enough to accommodate raised medians or where\nthere is an immediately adjacent, parallel roadway as\ndescribed above. Such gates may also be appropriate at\nproblem\nlocations where, despite median treatments, motorists\ncontinue to violate the automatic gates.\nThe Los Angeles LRT system is conducting a\nfederally funded demonstration project to examine the\napplicability of four quadrant gates at LRT crossings with\nimmediately adjacent, parallel roadways, where raised\nmedians cannot be installed and motor vehicles turning left\nfrom the parallel roadway are a concern. On the basis of the\nLos\nAngeles\nLRT\nsystem's\npreliminary\nresearch,\nconsiderations during the design of four-quadrant gate\nsystems should include (1) timing of the lowering of the\nexit gates relative to the entrance (standard) gates, (2)\ntrapping motor vehicles between the two sets of gates\non the LRT tracks, and (3) and exit gate failure mode (i.e.,\nshould the exit gates \"fail-safe\" in the up or down position).\nAt angled crossings (i.e., those crossings where the\nroadway and LRT tracks are not perpendicular), it may be\nFigure 3. Automatic gate end plate.\n\n____________________\nFigure 4. Example gate indication signal.\npossible to adjust the angle of the automatic gate on the\ncrossing roadway to more effectively block left turns across\nthe tracks from a roadway parallel to the LRT alignment\n(see Figure 22 in Section 6.1 of these guidelines). If the left\nturns cannot be effectively blocked using this technique and\nfor LRT crossings at 90 deg with respect to the roadway,\nleft-turn automatic gates or four-quadrant automatic gates\nshould be considered for installation. For more detailed\nrecommendations on automatic gate placement for the\ncrossing roadway and turn automatic gates, refer to Section\n6.1 (Automatic Gate Placement--Angle), guidelines 2 and 3\nrespectively. For more detailed recommendations on\nprotected traffic signal indications and LRV-activated no\nright/left turn signs, refer to Section 5.3 (Preemption\nGuidelines), Guideline 6.\nFinally, to deter motorists from driving around\nlowered automatic gates, automatic gate arms should\nextend to within 600 mm (2 ft) of the roadway centerline\n(where double yellow striping separates opposite directions\nof traffic) or raised median. Using this guideline, all the\nlanes of traffic on a particular approach to the crossing\nwould be effectively blocked by the lowered automatic gate\narm. This particular guideline does not apply to turn\nautomatic gates, which only need to be long enough to\nblock the intended movement. Also, special consideration\nshould be given to traffic movements (e.g., turning\nmovements) that may conflict with extending the automatic\ngate arm to within 600 mm (2 ft) of the roadway centerline.\nUnder such cases, it may only be\npossible to extend the gate arm to the middle of the farthest\ntraffic lane.\n2.\nCrossing Gate Indication Signal for LRV Operators.\nAt those crossings where sight distance does not allow\nLRV operators to visually confirm that the automatic gates\nand flashing light signals are functioning as intended, LRT\nagencies should install a gate indication signal with a\nminimum 200-mm (8-in.)-lensl0 in advance of the crossing\n(see Figure 4). For example, where LRVs approach a\ncrossing from around a blind curve such that an LRV\noperator cannot see the automatic gates until the LRV is\nessentially at the crossing, a gate indication signal in\nadvance of the crossing is essential. A gate indication\nsignal should be located so that if the automatic gates are\nnot functioning correctly (e.g., the gate arm is broken off\nthe mechanism), the operator can stop the LRV short of the\ngrade crossing under normal service breaking. Ideally, the\nsignal should display two separate\n10Most flashing light signals have 40-mm (1 5-in )-diameter holes in the side\nof the housing (called peepholes or sidelights) to allow LRV operators to\nvisually confirm that they are functioning as intended However, these\nsidelights are generally ineffective during daylight operations because of\ntheir small size. Further, if LRV operators are unable to see the flashing light\nsignals and automatic gates until they are almost upon the LRT crossing,\nthese small sidelights are essentially useless The basic idea is to know if the\ndevices are functioning as intended before it is too late to stop short of the\ncrossing.\n\n____________________\n____________________\nindications to an approaching LRV operator: (1) the\nflashing light signals and gates have been activated (i.e., the\nLRV detection system is functioning as intended) and (2)\nthe automatic gates are in the horizontal position.\nAs an alternative to installing gate indication signals in\nadvance of crossings, a wireless video link could be\nestablished between surveillance cameras mounted at LRT\ncrossings and approaching LRVs. LRV operators would\nthen be able to see the next crossing ahead on a small video\nmonitor well in advance of actual arrival at the crossing.\nAlthough not generally necessary for LRT operations\nbecause of LRVs' relatively short stopping distances\n(compared with railroad trains), wireless video tests by\nAmtrak suggest that it can be transmitted and received by\napproaching trains at distances greater than 6.5 km (4 mi).\nTransit agencies should also consider implementing\nsystems that monitor and report flashing light signal and\nautomatic gate malfunctions to a central control facility,\nsuch as a Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition\n(SCADA) system or other monitoring system that directly\nnotifies LRT maintenance personnel of a potential\nmalfunction.\n3.\nConstant Warning Time at LRT Crossings. Constant\nwarning time (CWT) or an approximation of CWT should\nbe provided at all higher speed LRT crossings with flashing\nlight signals and automatic gates. As used at railroad grade\ncrossings with flashing light signals and automatic gates,\nCWT systems measure the speed and acceleration (or\ndeceleration) of a train approaching a grade crossing. On\nthe basis of this information, the system predicts when the\ntrain will arrive at the grade crossing. The CWT system\nactivates the flashing light signals and automatic gates at a\nfixed (constant) time before the train arrives at the crossing\n(e.g., 20 sec). For example, if the CWT system determines\nthat a train is stopping short of the crossing, the flashing\nlight signals and automatic gates will not activate until the\ntrain starts to accelerate toward the crossing11. True CWT\nsystems (also known as Grade Crossing Predictors) used at\nrailroad crossings are generally incompatible with LRT\noperations because of electrical interference of the LRVs\noperating on the rails.\nCWT systems (or an approximation of such systems)\nprovide crossing users with a fixed warning time that is\n11CWT track circuits are designed to accommodate the fastest allowable\ntrain on the track in question. Thus, if a fast-moving train approaches a\ncrossing equipped with CWT and the CWT system determines that for this\nspeed of travel, it needs to lower the automatic gates (or start an advance\npreemption sequence) immediately in order to provide the minimum\nwarning time, it will at once commence activating the warning devices (or\nadvance preemption sequences) After this activation has occurred, the train\ncould still be slowed and even stopped before the crossing (e g., at a near\nside station) Depending on the exact CWT program, the automatic gates\ncould then clear until the train once again advances toward the crossing (the\ntrain operator may need to creep along the track to allow the CWT system to\nprovide the minimum amount of warning time).\nconsistent with their expectations12. For example, if\nautomatic gates and flashing light signals activate just as an\nLRV approaches a near-side station and if these devices\nremain activated while passengers board and alight,\ncrossing users may decide that their delay has been\nexcessive, an LRV is not really approaching the crossing\n(one is stopped in the nearby station), and opt to drive\naround the lowered automatic gates. This type of crossing\nuser behavior may be risky, especially if another LRV is\napproaching the crossing from the opposite direction.\nBecause LRV speed and acceleration (deceleration)\ncharacteristics are approximately known at each point\nalong a given LRT line (these characteristics will vary\nslightly based on individual LRV operators and prevailing\nweather conditions), standard LRV detection systems (e.g.,\nAudio Frequency Overlay [AFO] track circuits) should be\nsetup to approximate CWT. At those crossings with a near\nside station, automatic gate activation should be delayed\n(using timers or other methods) to accommodate LRV\ndwell time, not excessively delaying nearby crossing\nusers13 (see Figure 5).\nAn approximate CWT system should also be provided\nfor those crossings that are shared by both railroad and\nLRT, especially where the speed between the two types of\nrail movements varies by more than 15 km/h (10 mph). If\nrailroad trains and LRVs are operated on different tracks\nalong immediately adjacent rights-of-way (thereby sharing\ngrade crossings), the train detection systems on both rail\nlines should be adjusted to approximate CWT based on\ntypical maximum operating speeds of each train type. If\nrailroad trains and LRVs are operated on the same tracks, a\nmore elaborate system is necessary to approximate CWT at\ngrade crossings.\nFor example, depending on the speed difference\nbetween LRVs and railroad trains operating on the same\ntrack, it may be necessary to divide the standard track\ncircuit (which when an LRV or train is approaching,\nactivates the flashing light signals and automatic gates) into\nsmaller segments, using timers to approximate LRV or\ntrain speed. That is, it may be possible to determine, using a\nseries of track circuit segments, if an approaching LRV or\ntrain is operating within a certain speed range (e.g., less\nthan 55 km/h [35 mph], between 55 km/h [35 mph] and 70\nkm/h [45 mph], or greater than 70 km/h [45 mph]). Based\non the greatest speed in each range, the flashing light\nsignals and automatic gates would activate, providing an\napproximation of CWT at the crossing. A similar strategy\nmay also be readily adaptable for application where\nautomatic gate delay activation timers\n12One of the principles set forth in TCRP Report 17, \"Integration of Light\nRail Transit into City Streets\" (Chapter 3, pp. 66-67) is LRT system design\nand control should comply with motorist, pedestrian, and LRV operator\nexpectancy.\n13The Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices for Streets and Highways,\nSection 8C-5 (U.S Department of Transportation, Federal Highway\nAdministration, Washington, D C [1988] p. 8C-7), recommends, \"Special\ncontrol features should be used to eliminate the effects of station stops ...\nwithin approach control circuits.\"\n\n____________________\nFigure 5. Automatic gate delay time-space diagram.\nare installed at crossings adjacent to LRT stations. That is,\nif an LRV is detected as not slowing down for the near-side\nstation stop (e.g., an express or out-of-service [non\nrevenue] LRV), the gate delay activation timers would not\nengage, and the flashing light signals and automatic gates\nwould immediately activate.\n4.\nLRT\nCrossing\nSignage.\nPer\nthe\ngeneral\nrecommendations contained in the Manual on Uniform\nTraffic Control Devices for Streets and Highways14 Section\n2A-6, excessive\n14Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices for Streets and Highways,\nU.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Highway Administration,\nWashington, D.C. (1998) p. 2A-3\nuse of signs at LRT crossings controlled by automatic gates\nand flashing light signals should be avoided. A\nconservative use of regulatory and warning signs is\nrecommended as these signs, if used to excess, tend to lose\ntheir effectiveness. For example, DO NOT STOP ON\nTRACKS signs (R8-8), STOP HERE ON RED signs (R10\n6), and NO TURN ON RED signs (R10-11) have all been\nused together at some LRT crossings, all mounted in the\nvicinity of the RAILROAD CROSSING (Crossbuck) sign\n(R15-1). If one of each sign is installed at an LRT crossing\nand standard sign sizes are assumed, motorists would face\nover 2 sq. m (22 sq. ft) of black on white legend signs with\na total of 15 words. Most motorists simply cannot read and\nprocess so many words at a single location, especially when\nused in\n\n____________________\n____________________\nconjunction with active warning devices such as flashing\nlight signals and automatic gates. The most typical result of\nplacing so many signs so close together is motorist\nconfusion and total disregard of the intended messages (see\nFigure 6).\n5.\nSTOP signs (R1-1) near LRT Crossings. At\nintersections controlled by STOP signs (R1-l) located\nimmediately adjacent to an LRT crossing, do not force\nvehicles to stop on the tracks. Thus, it may be necessary to\nallow traffic that first passes through the LRT crossing to\nthen free-flow through the STOP-controlled intersection\n(i.e., no STOP sign on the crossing roadway approach to\nthe intersection). Depending on the distance between the\nintersection and the LRT crossing and depending on traffic\ncongestion and queues, it may be necessary to install a\ntraffic signal at the intersection so that it can be preempted\nto clear motor vehicles off the tracks when an LRV\napproaches, even though traffic signals may not be\nwarranted by the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control\nDevices for Streets and Highways, Section 4C (Warrants)15.\nReplacing a STOP sign with traffic signals at an\nintersection near an LRT crossing should be determined\nbased on site-specific considerations. If traffic signals are\nnecessary, their preemption to clear motor vehicles off the\ntracks is discussed in greater detail in Section 5.\n6.\nSight Distance at LRT Crossings. LRT crossings\nshould be designed to maximize visibility for LRV\noperators to clearly see the entire grade crossing\nenvironment and for crossing users to clearly see\napproaching LRVs. Obstructions that block visibility\nshould be located away from the LRT tracks (see Figure 7).\nGood sight distance is especially critical for pedestrians\nbecause LRV-activated crossing control devices (flashing\nlight signals and automatic gates) may not be provided\nspecifically for pedestrians, such as in LRT station areas\nwhere pedestrians cross the LRT tracks at-grade.\nSight distance obstructions at LRT crossings include\nticket\nvending\nmachines,\nwayside\ncommunications\nhousing, power substations, and occasionally the station\naccess building itself. Fencing along the right-of-way may\nalso limit sight distance if it is taller than 1.1 m (3.5 ft)\nwithin about 75 to 110 m (250 to 350 ft) of the LRT\ncrossing (measured along the LRT alignment back from the\nLRT crossing)16. Likewise, landscaping near LRT crossings\nand stations may limit sight distance; therefore, it should\nonly be installed at locations where it does not interfere\nwith visibility. Further,\n15Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices for Streets and Highways, U S\nDepartment\nof\nTransportation,\nFederal\nHighway\nAdministration,\nWashington, D.C. (1988) pp. 4C-1-4C-12\n16This set-back distance depends on several factors, including speeds of\napproaching LRVs and the distance between the LRT tracks and the fencing\n(which depends on the right-of-way width) Therefore, the exact setback\ndistance between the LRT crossing and taller fence sections (taller than 1.1\nm [3 5 ft]) should be determined based on an engineering study of the LRT\ncrossing in question\nFigure 6. Example of sign clutter at an LRT crossing.\nit should be maintained (e.g., routine pruning and\ntrimming) so as not to become a sight distance obstruction\nin the future.\n7.\nMotor Vehicle Escape Channelization. On roadways\nwhere motor vehicles queue back from a downstream\nobstruction (e.g., a congested driveway entrance) toward\nthe LRT crossing, consider striping the roadway to provide\neither an adjacent free-flow lane or paved shoulder so that\nmotorists can escape the track area if necessary (Figure 8).\nFor example, a free-flow escape lane could be provided\nwhere motor vehicles queue in order to turn into a heavily\nused driveway or unsignalized cross street. In this case,\nstriping a through lane and turn pocket allows through\ntraffic to proceed around the turn queue. Thus, motorists\nstopped on or near the tracks while waiting in the turn\nqueue would be able to clear the tracks into the free-flow\nthrough lane (or escape lane). A paved shoulder serves a\nsimilar function. That is, with an additional free-flow lane\nor shoulder, motor vehicles stopped on the tracks when the\nflashing light signals and automatic gates activate could\ndrive forward to clear the tracks.\n8.\nPublic Notification of an LRT Crossing Problem. Per\nthe\nNational\nTransportation\nSafety\nBoard's\nrecommendations17, LRT crossings should be equipped\nwith a small plaque displaying a telephone number\n(preferably a 1-800 number) for the public to contact the\ntransit agency in case the automatic gates and flashing light\nsignals malfunction (see Figure 9) or\n17National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) Recommendations R-961,\n2, 3 Washington, D C (1996).\n\nFigure 7. Sight distance.\nin case a motor vehicle becomes disabled on the tracks.\nThis plaque should also indicate the name and/or number of\nthe crossing. The telephone number should connect the\ncaller with LRT central control or transit police as\nappropriate. These plaques displaying the transit agency's\ntelephone number should be installed even if the\nmetropolitan area in\nquestion has a general roadside hazard number (e.g., *11\nfrom a cellular telephone) or 911 emergency telephone\nsystem. Typically, general roadside hazard and 911\ntelephone operators are not intimately familiar with\npotential hazards at LRT crossings and, furthermore, do not\nhave any direct communication link to approaching LRVs.\n\nFigure 8. Motor vehicle escape channelization.\n4.2 System Operations and Maintenance Guidelines\n1.\nNew\nLRT\nSystem\nOperating\nSpeeds.\nWhen\nimplementing a new LRT system or extending an existing\nsystem, develop a program to gradually increase the speed\nof LRVs through gated grade crossings. For example, if the\ndesigned LRV operating speed on a section of track is 90\nkm/h (55 mph), during pre-revenue testing, the LRVs could\noperate at 40 km/h (25 mph); during the 1st month of\nrevenue service, the LRVs\ncould operate at 55 km/h (35 mph); during the 2nd and 3rd\nmonths of operation, the LRVs could operate at 70 km/h\n(45 mph); and finally, after 6 months of operation, the\nLRVs could then operate at the designed track speed. This\ntype of program is especially important for LRT corridors\nwhere slower railroad trains previously operated. Crossing\nusers may have grown accustomed to only a few slow\ntrains per day or week or, in some cases, no trains at all if\nthe corridor has been abandoned. Thus, these crossing users\nmust learn that higher\n\n____________________\nFigure 9. Example public notification plaque.\nspeed trains will be using the crossing on a regular,\nfrequent basis. As part of this program, the gate activation\npoints along the track should either be physically adjusted\nfor the different speeds or installed at their ultimate\nlocation (i.e., for the fastest planned operating speed) with\nadjustable delay timers to provide constant warning time at\nthe various speeds increments. If the light rail transit\nagency cannot adjust the LRV detection points (so that the\ncrossing warning devices are active for approximately a\nconstant warning time), one option may be to limit gradual\nLRV speed increases to the pre-revenue testing period.\nThe practice of a 6-month gradual increase in LRV\nspeeds through gated grade crossings is based on the\nsuccessful experience of the St. Louis LRT system. The\ngradual speed increase must be coupled with a strong\npublic outreach and education program to advise the public\nof the incremental LRV speed build up over a 6-month\nperiod. A timeline of the gradual speed increase may be a\nbeneficial tool to alert the public of the schedule involved.\n2.\nSecond LRV Pedestrian Collision Avoidance. Where\npossible, LRV operators should be trained to minimize the\noccurrence of accidents resulting from pedestrians crossing\nbehind one LRV and into the path of a second, opposite\ndirection LRV. Where LRVs routinely pass one another at\nor near a pedestrian crossing, one strategy to minimize the\nsecond LRV conflict is to have the first LRV operator slow\nor stop to physically block the pedestrian path until the\nsecond, opposite direction LRV enters the crossing (see\nFigure\n10). In this manner, pedestrians cannot enter the crossing\nprior to the second LRVs arrival18.\n3.\nLRT Crossing Maintenance. Higher speed LRT\ncrossing hardware (e.g., flashing light signals and\nautomatic gates) should be maintained in good working\norder, and to the crossing user, it should appear in good\nworking order. When flashing light signals are out of\nalignment or when automatic gate arm lights are hanging\ndown off the gate arm, crossing users may soon realize that\nthe LRT crossing warning\n18Depending on the number of locations where this pedestrian collision\navoidance strategy is implemented, it probably would only slightly affect\nLRV operating schedules Because this strategy would be practiced only by\nLRV operators when two, opposite direction LRVs are closely spaced\n(where the flashing light signals and automatic gates (if present) will remain\nactive because of the second approaching LRV), the LRV delay caused by\nthis safety practice would be no longer than 20 to 30 sec (certainly less than\n1 min) for the LRV actually blocking the crossing (the inbound LRV would\nexperience no delay) for one or two crossing locations. This delay is\nminimal, considering other de facto operating delays (boarding and alighting\nwheelchair patrons at low platform stations, slowing for trespassers along\nthe right-of-way, slight variations in individual LRV operator driving speeds\nand styles, etc ) For example, if over the course of a 30-km (19-mi) route\nsegment with an average speed of about 50 km/h (including station dwell\ntimes), the delay because of a 1 km/h error on the speedometer display\nwould result in a schedule variance of about 45 sec (not considering any\nother factors) Thus, accommodating a collision avoidance strategy that\nrequires LRVs to slow or stop for a short time at one or two pedestrian\ncrossing locations where LRVs routinely meet one another would not greatly\ninterfere with overall LRV operating schedules\n\nFigure 10. Second LRV approaching safety.\ndevices are not maintained appropriately and therefore not\nreliable. Automatic gate and LRV detection (track\ncircuitry) system maintenance are especially critical\nbecause if there is a problem, the automatic gates will \"fail-\nsafe\" in the lowered or horizontal position. If a crossing\nuser notices that the automatic gates are descending yet an\nLRV is not approaching (i.e., false activation of the\nwarning devices) and the crossing hardware looks to be in\ngeneral disrepair, crossing users may ignore the warnings,\neven if an LRV is actually approaching. Good maintenance\nof LRT crossing warning systems (including the LRV\ndetection (track\ncircuitry) systems) leads to increased credibility and\nobedience by motorists and pedestrians.\n5 TRAFFIC SIGNAL PREEMPTION GUIDELINES\n5.1 Definition\nPreemption is the transfer from normal operation of\nthe traffic signals to a special control mode. Traffic signals\nat intersections located near higher speed LRT crossings\nmay\n\n____________________\nneed to be interconnected19 with the grade crossing warning\nsystems (i.e., the LRV detection system) and preempted\nwhen LRVs approach. Preemption of traffic signals is\nnecessary when the traffic queue from the nearby\nintersection extends (or would likely extend) to the LRT\ncrossing. When an LRV is detected approaching the grade\ncrossing (usually through some sort of track circuitry), the\nadjacent traffic signals enter a preemption sequence which\nfirst clears motor vehicles queued back from the\nintersection off the tracks and then may allow traffic\nmovements that do not conflict with the approaching LRV\nto proceed after the initial clear-out phase. In Figure 11,\nthis traffic queue extending from the signalized intersection\nback toward the LRT crossing is identified as the\n\"influence zone\" queue.\nAfter the queued vehicles are cleared off the tracks,\nlocally specified control strategies may be used to\naccommodate special traffic conditions; however, the\ntraffic signals typically switch to one of the following\ncontrol modes.\n1.\nAll red, holding all motor vehicles until the LRV\npasses through the crossing. This traffic signal control\nstrategy is not typically used at intersections located near\nLRT crossings because it severely limits the intersection\ncapacity or throughput, potentially leading to traffic\ncongestion.\n2.\nFlashing all red, allowing motor vehicles to proceed\nthrough the intersection after coming to a complete stop at\nthe Stop Bar. This traffic signal control strategy allows\nmotor vehicles traveling toward the LRT crossing to turn\nleft or right onto the roadway that parallels the LRT\nalignment and allows motor vehicles traveling parallel to\nthe LRT alignment to cross the roadway that intersects with\nthe LRT tracks. This traffic signal control strategy has two\nprimary drawbacks:\n(1) motor vehicles could stop at the intersection and then\nproceed toward the LRT crossing (with a lowered\nautomatic gate), queuing back and blocking the intersection\nfor other allowable movements, and\n(2) the intersection essentially functions as if it were\ncontrolled by STOP signs on all approaches, thus its\ncapacity or throughput is greatly reduced during the\npreemption.\n3.\nLimited service operation. Under this traffic signal\ncontrol strategy, the traffic signals typically display green\naspects for motor vehicles traveling parallel to the LRT\nalignment and red aspects (or turn restrictions) for motor\nvehicles conflicting with the LRV movement through the\ncrossing. If the preemption duration is long enough, the\nsignals could also provide limited service to those motor\nvehicles turning off the crossing roadway onto the parallel\nroadway at the signalized intersection (this would require\nthe traffic signal to have protected left turn phases).\n19Interconnection is the electrical connection between the LRT active\nwarning systems (the LRV detection system) and the traffic signal controller\nassembly for the purpose of preemption\n\n____________________\n____________________\n5.2 When to Preempt Traffic Signals\nAs identified in the Manual on Uniform Traffic\nControl Devices for Streets and Highways20 (MUTCD)\nSection 8C6, the distance between the LRT crossing and\nthe signalized intersection21 that should be considered for\ninterconnection and preemption is 60 m (200 ft). The\nMUTCD states, \"Except under unusual circumstances,\npreemption should be limited to the highway intersection\ntraffic signals within 200 feet [60 m] of the grade crossing.\"\nHowever, the need for interconnection and preemption\nshould be based on a detailed queuing analysis (considering\nitems such as roadway approach traffic volumes, number of\nlanes, nearby traffic signal timing, saturation flow rates,\nmotor vehicle arrival characteristics, and motor vehicle\nclasses), rather than a prespecified distance such as 60 m\n(200 ft) because, under certain conditions, traffic queues\nfrom a nearby intersection could extend well beyond 60 m\n(200 ft) and trap stopped vehicles on the LRT tracks. New\nguidelines and recommended practices (some of which are\nunder development) recognize the need to consider\ninterconnection and preemption at distances greater than 60\nm (200 ft)22.\n20Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices for Streets and Highways, U.S\nDepartment\nof\nTransportation,\nFederal\nHighway\nAdministration,\nWashington, D.C. (1988) pp. 8C-7, 8\n21This distance is known as the Clear Storage Distance The Clear Storage\nDistance is the length available for vehicle storage between 2 m (6 ft) from\nthe rail nearest the intersection to the intersection Stop Bar or the normal\nstopping point on the highway At skewed crossings and intersections, the 2\nm (6 ft) distance is measured perpendicular to the nearest rail, either along\nthe centerline or right edge line as appropriate to obtain the shortest clear\ndistance.\n22The most current, new version of Part VIII (Traffic Control Systems for\nRailroad-Highway Grade Crossings) of the Manual on Uniform Traffic\nControl Devices for Streets and Highways states, 'Coordination with the\nroadway-rail intersection warning system should be considered for traffic\ncontrol signals located more than 60 m (200 ft) from the crossing. Factors\nshould include motor vehicle traffic volumes, approach speeds and queue\nlengths' (from the Notice of Proposed Amendments to the Manual on\nUniform Traffic Control Devices, FHWA Docket No. 96 47, U.S.\nDepartment\nof\nTransportation,\nFederal\nHighway\nAdministration,\nWashington, D.C. [1996] p. 8D-4.)\nSimilarly, the latest draft (February 16, 1997) of the new Part X\n(Traffic Controls for Highway-Light Rail Transit Grade Crossings) of the\nManual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices for Streets and Highways\nstates, 'When an LRT-highway grade crossing with automatic gates or\nflashing light signals is located within 60 meters (200 feet) of an intersection\nor mid-block location controlled by a traffic control signal, the traffic control\nsignal should be provided with preemption in accordance with Section 4D13\nCoordination with the LRT crossing warning system should be considered\nfor traffic control signals located more than 60 meters (200 feet) from the\ncrossing Factors to be considered should include traffic volumes, vehicle\nmix, approach speeds, and queue lengths.'\nThe Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) Recommended\nPractice on the Preemption of Traffic Signals At or Near Railroad Grade\nCrossings with Active Warning Devices (June 1997) addresses the need for\npreemption based on traffic volumes in greater detail This Recommended\nPractice (RP), developed by the ITE Traffic Engineering Council Committee\n96-04 (formerly 4M-35), is available from ITE (525 School Street, S.W.,\nSuite 410, Washington, D.C, 20024-2797 [202] 554-8050).\nIn some cases, usually for traffic congestion and\ncirculation reasons, it may also be necessary to preempt\nnearby traffic signals to prevent vehicles queuing back\nfrom the LRT crossing (when the automatic gates are\nlowered) back toward the signalized intersection. In Figure\n11, this traffic queue extending from the lowered automatic\ngate back toward the signalized intersection is identified as\nthe \"gate spill back\" queue.\n5.3 Preemption Guidelines\nWith this background, the following guidelines on\ntraffic signal preemption address conflicts that could cause\nmotorists to be confused. As with all the guidelines in this\nchapter, they are based on 11 LRT systems' operating\nexperience, detailed accident information, and field\nobservations of the traffic signal preemption process and\nrelated motorist behavior. One guiding principle relevant to\nall of the following guidelines is that LRT agencies and\nhighway authorities must establish clear communication\nprocedures\nto\ncoordinate\nall\ninterconnection\nand\npreemption efforts. For example, the highway authority\nshould notify the LRT agency of any changes to the traffic\nsignal timing at interconnected locations before the changes\nare implemented. Similarly, the LRT agency should notify\nthe highway authority of any changes to the track circuits\nthat detect LRVs approaching the LRT crossing. Under no\ncircumstances\nshould\neither\nparty\ndisconnect\nthe\ninterconnection between the LRV detection system and the\ntraffic signals without first notifying the other party some\nreasonable amount of time in advance23.\n1.\nAdvance Traffic Signals (Pre-Signals). On those\nroadway approaches where motorists first pass through an\nLRT crossing and then approach a signalized intersection\n(located less than about 30 m [100 ft] from the LRT\ncrossing), minimize motorist confusion about traffic signal\npreemption by installing advance traffic signals on the near\nside of the LRT crossing (pre-signals). As defined by the\nImplementation Report of the USDOT Grade Crossing\nSafety Task Force, pre-signals are \"supplemental highway\ntraffic signal faces\n23According to a report by the Grade Crossing Safety Task Force (formed by\nthe former Secretary of Transportation Federico Pena to improve at-grade\nrail crossing safety in light of the commuter railroad train-school bus\ncollision in Fox River Grove, Illinois), \"A lack of coordination in [many]\nareas has frequently resulted in the false assumption that 'someone else is\ntaking care of the problem' when in fact no one is. Even though many of the\nactions taken by individual parties were quite thorough, these actions were\nless effective than they could have been because they took place\nindependently.\" It goes on to say, \"Since multiple parties use and are\nresponsible for grade crossings, communication among these parties and an\nunderstanding of their roles and activities are essential In practice, some\ngrade crossing activities are carried out in an environment that lacks mutual\nawareness and dialogue. Those rail crossing actions that take place without\nadequate information exchange or consideration can compromise safety \"\n(Accidents That Shouldn't Happen, U S Department of Transportation,\nWashington, D.C (1996) pp. 4-5).\n\noperated as part of the highway intersection traffic signals,\nlocated in a position that controls traffic approaching the\nrailroad\ncrossing\nand\nintersection.\"\nLRT\nagency\nrepresentatives expressed concern that during the traffic\nsignal preemption sequence, motorists focus on the\ndownstream traffic signal indications rather than the\nflashing light signals located at the LRT crossing\n(immediately upstream from the intersection). As shown in\nFigure 12, this type of motorist behavior is especially\nundesirable during the beginning of the preemption\nsequence when the downstream traffic signals are typically\ngreen, clearing queued vehicles off the tracks, and the\nflashing light signals are activated (before the automatic\ngates start to descend or are fully lowered). Motorists are\neither confused by the conflicting message from the two\ntraffic control devices--green traffic signal indications in\nconjunction with red flashing light signals--or simply\nignore the flashing light signals altogether. In fact, many of\nthe LRT agencies reported that some motorists are so intent\non the green downstream traffic signals, they will drive\nthrough a completely lowered automatic gate arm, breaking\nit off the mechanism.\nMotorists may be focusing on downstream traffic\nsignals rather than flashing light signals because traffic\nsignals produce more intense light than flashing light\nsignals. Flashing light signals generally have a maximum\nlamp wattage of only 25 (at 10 volts) whereas traffic\nsignals typically operate with a lamp wattage of 100 (at 120\nvolts). The requirement\nfor a storage battery source of standard power for flashing\nlight signal and automatic gate operation during power\noutages limits these devices to operating on these power\nrequirements. To simplify motorists' decisions and\nminimize confusion, one possible solution is to use\nprogramable visibility (commonly referred to as PV) traffic\nsignal heads. Once these heads are programmed, motorists\nshould not be able to see the downstream traffic signal until\nthey pass the flashing light signals. The only limitation of\nPV heads is that they are not completely effective after\nsunset.\nIf LRT operates after sunset or if the signalized\nintersection is immediately adjacent to the LRT crossing\n(also limiting the effectiveness of PV heads), traffic signals\ncould be installed on the near side of the LRT crossing,\nupstream of the traffic signals that control the intersection.\nWhen an LRV approaches the crossing, the pre-signals (on\nthe near side of the LRT crossing) would turn red, stopping\nmotor vehicles on the near side of the LRT crossing. The\npre-signals would turn red before the traffic signals at the\nintersection (i.e., the downstream traffic signals), thereby\nclearing motor vehicles off the tracks and, at the same time,\nnot allowing any more motor vehicles to move onto the\ntracks. As discussed further in recommendation 4 (below),\nan added benefit of pre-signals is that they can be operated\nin conjunction with the intersection signals so that on every\nsignal cycle at the intersection, the pre-signals always\nprevent queues from forming between the intersection Stop\nBar and\nFigure 12. Conflicting message for motorists.\n\n____________________\nthe LRT tracks, whether or not an LRV is approaching the\ncrossing24.\nWhen pre-signals are used, motorists approaching the\nLRT crossing would be less inclined to focus solely on the\ndownstream traffic signals located at the intersection. The\ntraffic signals located downstream at the intersection\nshould use PV heads to minimize any possibility of\nconfusion with the pre-signals.\nPrevious research studies conducted in the United\nStates25 and European highway-rail crossing experience\nsuggest that motorists using crossings located in an area\ncharacterized by signalized intersections respond with\nregularity to traffic signals. In fact, to change to a different\ntype of active traffic control device (flashing light signals),\nwhich typically rest in the non-activated state, requires\nsome adjustments for a motorist from a human factors\nperspective. Thus, because most LRT systems are\nconstructed in urban areas, traffic signals are commonplace\nand generally more credible than flashing light signals.\nAs shown in Figure 13, pre-signals should be mounted\non a standard traffic signal mast arm, cantilevered over the\nroadway travel lanes. Cantilevered flashing light signals\nshould not be used for this roadway approach if\ncantilevered pre-signals are used. If pre-signals are\ninstalled, flashing light signals are probably not essential\nfrom a traffic control perspective26; the pre-signals, which\nare generally more credible devices and are also better\nunderstood by most motorists, control the LRT crossing.\nFurther research should be conducted to determine if\nflashing light signals can be eliminated where pre-signals\nare used. If flashing light\n24After the school bus-commuter railroad train collision in Fox River Grove,\nIllinois on October 25, 1995, a Grade Crossing Safety Task Force was\nconvened by the then Secretary of Transportation Federico Pena This Task\nForce identified five safety problem areas for more detailed examination: (1)\ninterconnected traffic signals, (2) vehicle storage space, (3) high-profile\ncrossings, (4) light rail transit crossings, and (5) special vehicle operations.\nThe U S Department of Transportation (DOT) convened a Technical\nWorking Group (TWG), consisting of technical experts in various fields\nrelated to these five topic areas, to evaluate current standards and guidelines.\nThe DOT asked the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) to chair the\nTWG. The TWG's first product, Implementation Report of the USDOT\nGrade Crossing Safety Task Force was published on June 1, 1997.\nIn the Implementation Report of the USDOT Grade Crossing Safety\nTask Force, the TWG recommended the use of pre-signals to minimize\nmotorist\nconfusion\nand\nimprove\nhighway-rail\nintersection\nsafety.\nSpecifically, at any highway-rail intersection (including higher speed LRT\ncrossings) where there is insufficient distance between 1.8 m (6 ft) of the\nnearest rail and the intersection Stop Bar to safely stop the design vehicle for\nthat\nroadway,\npre-signals\nshould\nbe\ninstalled\nOther\npre-signal\nrecommendations were also included in this report.\n25Field Evaluation of Innovative Active Warning Devices for Use at\nRailroad-Highway Grade Crossings (FHWA-RD-88-135), U.S. Department\nof Transportation, Federal Highway Administration, Washington, D.C\n(1988) pp 201-209.\n26Other guidelines and/or regulations, such as those in the Manual on\nUniform Traffic Control Devices for Streets and Highways or those\npublished by a local regulatory agency, may require the use of flashing light\nsignals at all highway-rail crossings where automatic gates are required. For\nLRT,\nsignals are required for the LRT crossing in question, they\nshould only be installed on the side of the roadway, as\nshown in Figure 13.\nIf the LRT crossing is located immediately adjacent to\nthe signalized intersection, it may be possible to locate the\nvehicle Stop Bar ahead of the LRT tracks so that the pre-\nsignals are the only signals that control the intersection\napproach. Figure 14 illustrates a highway-rail crossing in\nKrefeld, Germany, where the crossing control devices have\nbeen integrated with the nearby intersection. That is, the\npre-signal serves to control both the rail crossing and the\nimmediately adjacent intersection.\n2.\nCantilevered Flashing Light Signals with Cantilevered\nTraffic Signals. At those locations where the LRT crossing\nis located immediately adjacent to a signalized intersection\n(as depicted in Figure 14), minimize motorist confusion by\navoiding the use of both cantilevered flashing light signals\nand cantilevered traffic signals on the same crossing\nroadway approach on the same side of the tracks (Figure\n15). When flashing light signals must be used near an\nintersection that is controlled by traffic signals mounted on\nmast arms, the flashing light signals should be post\nmounted on the side of the crossing roadway near or on the\nautomatic gate mechanisms.\nTypically, flashing light signals are mounted on\ncantilevered structures, allowing railway signal maintainers\nto walk out on the structure over the roadway for routine\nmaintenance (thus not blocking any lanes of traffic), while\ntraffic signals are typically mounted on simple cantilevered\npoles (mast arms); it is standard practice for traffic signal\nmaintainers to use a \"bucket truck\" for routine\nmaintenance. When these two different cantilevered\nsupports are installed immediately adjacent to one another,\neach supporting their respective signals, motorists may\nbecome confused. The level of motorist confusion during\nthe traffic signal preemption sequence may be high, as the\ntraffic signals display solid red indications (not allowing\nany further vehicles to enter the LRT crossing) while the\nimmediately adjacent flashing light signals display two red\nflashing indications. Also, when separate flashing light and\ntraffic signal cantilevers are provided, the intersection/LRT\ncrossing becomes visually and physically cluttered with\nhardware, especially because the automatic gates are also\nclose together.\nthese crossings are generally where LRVs operate at speeds greater than 55\nkm/h (35 mph)\nThe authors of Field Evaluation of Innovative Active Warning Devices\nfor Use at Railroad-Highway Grade Crossings (FHWA-RD-88-135, p.209)\nsuggest that all rail-type control devices (including crossbucks (R15-1) and\nadvance warning signs (W10-1)) should be eliminated In their place,\nintersection Stop Bars and Signal Ahead (W3-3) warning signs should be\ninstalled on crossing approaches. Stop Bars are essential--the normal\nintersection cues may not be present at a highway-rail crossing. In fact,\nSTOP HERE ON RED signs (R10-6) may be used to supplement the Stop\nBar.\n\n____________________\n____________________\nFigure 13. LRT crossing pre-signals.\n3.\nAdvance Preemption. At LRT crossings where an\napproaching LRV preempts nearby traffic signals, provide\nsufficient advance warning time to adequately terminate\nother signal phases prior to the track clearance phase (the\ntraffic signal phase that provides green indications for those\nvehicles queued back from the nearby intersection to the\nLRT tracks). The Manual on Uniform Traffic Control\nDevices for Streets and Highways, Section 8C-527, requires\nthe LRV detection system (typically some type of track\ncircuitry) to provide a minimum of 20 sec warning time\nbefore the LRV arrives at the crossing. However, a longer\nLRV arrival warning time may be necessary (the MUTCD-\nspecified 20 sec is just a minimum), especially to terminate\nother traffic signal phases less abruptly prior to the track\nclearance phase28.\nFor example, approaching LRVs should be detected\nearly enough to appropriately terminate pedestrian\nmovements that conflict with motor vehicles needing to\nclear the tracks prior to LRV arrival at the crossing\n(typically pedestrian movements crossing parallel to the\nLRT alignment).\n27Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices for Streets and Highways, U.S\nDepartment\nof\nTransportation,\nFederal\nHighway\nAdministration,\nWashington, D C. (1988) pp 8C-5, 7\n28In their first work product published in June 1997, the U S. DOT's TWG\n(for more details on this group, see Footnote 21) developed similar\nrecommendations regarding advance preemption of traffic signals at\nhighway-highway intersections near highway-rail intersections.\nAt a signalized intersection located near an LRT\ncrossing where pedestrian activity is light, pedestrian\nsignals (displaying WALK/DONT WALK indications) are\nnot typically provided and thus no special treatment (early\nLRV detection) is required. Where pedestrian activity is\nmoderate to significant, pedestrian signals are likely to be\ninstalled as part of the traffic signal control system at the\nintersection. If these moderate to significant pedestrian\nflows are expected to be intermittent (e.g., near schools or\nbus stops), pedestrian pushbuttons29 are likely to be\ninstalled so that the WALK indication illuminates only\nwhen pedestrians are actually waiting to cross (otherwise,\nthe pedestrian signals would rest in the DONT WALK\nstate). If moderate to significant pedestrian flows are steady\nthroughout most of the day (as typically occurs in a\ndowntown environment), pedestrian WALK / DONT\nWALK indications are likely to be provided on every\ntraffic signal cycle, thus a pedestrian pushbutton would not\nbe necessary30. For either of these two cases (either\nintermittent or regular pedestrian flows),\n29Pushbuttons are pedestrian actuation devices mounted on a post or pole on\nthe sidewalk at signalized highway-highway intersections where pedestrian\nsignals are provided When pushed, they notify the traffic signal controller to\nserve the desired pedestrian phase the next time a non-conflicting motor\nvehicle movement receives green traffic signal indications.\n30Because higher speed LRT operations typically occur outside of a\ndowntown environment, pedestrian activity will typically be either light (no\npedestrian signals) or moderate to heavy with intermittent flow\n(pushbuttons).\n\n____________________\n____________________\nFigure 14. Intersection and LRT crossing control device integration.\nnew LRT system design should allow LRVs to be detected\nearly enough to first clear pedestrians out of the crosswalk\nand then clear motor vehicles off the tracks31.\nFor example, if the crossing roadway is 25 m (80 ft)\nwide and if pedestrian signals are provided for walking\nacross this roadway and if an LRV is detected approaching\nthe crossing just as pedestrians receive their WALK signal\nindication, it would take about 20 sec just to clear the\n31The Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices for Streets and Highways,\nSection 8C-6 (U S Department of Transportation, Federal Highway\nAdministration, Washington, D C.\n(1988) p 8C-7), states, 'Preemption\nshall not cause any short vehicular clearances and all necessary vehicular\nclearances shall be provided However, because of the relative hazards\ninvolved, pedestrian clearances may be abbreviated in order to provide the\ntrack clearance display as early as possible ' Where pedestrian clearances are\nabbreviated, the parallel street traffic (moving both parallel to the LRT\ntracks and the crossing pedestrians) should receive a minimum of 4 sec of\ngreen time (or as required by local conditions) so that motorists do not start\nup and 1 sec later receive a yellow then red traffic signal indication This\nmay catch some motorists in the middle of the intersection\nHowever, LRT agencies should attempt to detect approaching LRVs\nearly enough to provide appropriate clearances for both vehicles and\npedestrians, especially since most LRT systems have relatively frequent\nservice and are located in urban areas with potentially high pedestrian\nvolumes (e g, near LRT stations). Early detection is relatively easy to\naccomplish on new LRT systems and should be accounted for during track\ncircuit design On some existing LRT systems where pedestrian clearances\nare not just abbreviated but terminated immediately upon LRV detection\n(the pedestrian signals simply blank-out, leaving pedestrians in the\ncrosswalk with approaching motor vehicles clearing the tracks), a small sign\nmay be installed (perhaps near the pedestrian pushbutton) to warn them that\ntheir signal may be abbreviated or terminated (as appropriate) with an\napproaching LRV\npedestrians out of the crosswalk and about another 10 or\nmore sec to clear any queued motor vehicles off the tracks.\nThus, for this example, the minimum warning time of 20\nsec is inadequate (and hazardous) and a longer warning\ntime (e.g., 40 sec) is necessary to provide queued motor\nvehicles with a sufficient track clearance phase.\nOn existing LRT systems where the LRV detection\npoints have already been set, pedestrian clearance phases\nmay be abbreviated (but should not terminated) to clear\nmotor vehicles off the tracks before the LRV arrives at the\ncrossing. Pedestrian signals should not blank out (turn off)\nwhen the LRT preemption is received by the traffic signal\ncontroller. If the motor vehicle clearance phase cannot be\nadequately provided without immediately terminating\npedestrian clearance phases, the LRV detection points\nalong the track should be adjusted. Special consideration\nshould be given to crosswalks regularly used by elderly\npedestrians or school children. With this type of pedestrian\nactivity, pedestrian clearance phases should not be\nterminated or abbreviated.\nWhen longer than minimum warning times are\nnecessary, the traffic signals should receive notification of\nan approaching LRV prior to the activation of the flashing\nlight signals and automatic gates32. In this fashion, the\ntraffic signals can start to prepare for the track clearance\nphase\n32This concept is known as Advance Preemption. Advance Preemption\noccurs as follows: notification of an approaching LRV is forwarded to the\nhighway traffic signal controller unit or assembly by rail equipment for a\nperiod of time prior to activating the active warning devices (e g, flashing\nlight signals and automatic gates)\n\nFigure 15. LRT crossings with cantilevered flashing light and traffic signals.\nprior to the activation of the grade crossing devices (e.g.,\nflashing light signals and automatic gates). The grade\ncrossing devices can then be activated to provide a CWT of\nabout 20 sec.\n4.\nQueue Prevention Strategies. At LRT crossings\nlocated\nnear\nsignalized\nintersections\nwhere\ntraffic\ncongestion\nprecludes\nusing\nstandard\ntraffic\nsignal\npreemption, use traffic control strategies to prevent queues\nfrom extending back over the LRT tracks (see Figure 16).\nStandard traffic signal preemption operates under the\nassumption that motor\nvehicles queue back from the nearby signalized intersection\n(from Signal D in Figure 16) across the LRT tracks. The\npreemption sequence (occurring at the traffic signals\ndownstream of the LRT crossing, Signal D in Figure 16)\nthen clears these queued vehicles off the tracks prior to the\nLRV arriving at the crossing. However, at some locations,\nit may not be practical or possible to clear vehicles from the\ntracks by preempting the downstream traffic signals. For\nexample, if the roadway crossing the LRT tracks is heavily\ncongested, preempting the downstream traffic signals may\nstill not allow motor vehicles to move forward enough to\nclear the\n\nFigure 16. Queue prevention strategies.\n\n____________________\ncrossing because of the queue extending from the next\ndownstream, signalized intersection (Signal E in Figure\n16). If the level of traffic congestion is substantial, it may\nbe necessary to preempt several downstream traffic signals,\nrequiring that an approaching LRV be detected several\nminutes before it actually arrives at the crossing. In such\ncases, a queue prevention strategy may be more\nappropriate.\nThe basic concept of queue prevention is as follows: if\na queue is detected near an LRT crossing, traffic\napproaching the crossing will be slowed or stopped by a\nsignal upstream of the grade crossing (Signals B or C in\nFigure 16) in order to prevent the queue from building back\nacross the tracks. As shown in Figure 16, vehicle detectors\n(e.g., loop detectors, video detectors, and microwave\ndetectors) could be installed at Location A; if stopped or\nslow vehicles are detected at Location A, logic built into\nthe traffic signal system controller could\n-\nStop the major flow of traffic at Signal B (depending\non the level of traffic congestion and the distance\nbetween Location A and the tracks, it may be\nnecessary to stop vehicles from turning onto the\ncrossing roadway from the parallel roadway at Signal\nB using either protected signal indications [red\narrows] or LRV-activated No Right/Left Turn signs\n[R3-1, 2]);\n-\nStop the flow of traffic at Signal C, using traffic\nsignals on the near side of the LRT crossing (i.e., pre-\nsignals as described in Section 5.3 above); or\n-\nRemind motorists not to stop on the LRT tracks by\nproviding LRV-activated, internally illuminated DO\nNOT STOP ON TRACKS signs (R8-8) mounted on a\nmast arm over each lane of traffic at Location C (these\nsigns would activate when queues are detected at\nLocation A).\nUnder these queue prevention strategies, the LRT\ncrossing would be clear of motor vehicles at all times,\nwhether or not an LRV is actually approaching the crossing\n(as opposed to preemption which clears the tracks only\nwhen an LRV is approaching). As an alternate to using a\nvehicle detection system at Location A in Figure 16 to\nmanipulate the traffic signals, the pre-signals (Signal C)\ncould switch red several seconds prior to downstream\ntraffic signals (Signal D) on every signal cycle, thereby\nclearing the area between the downstream intersection and\nthe LRT tracks on every signal cycle. However, this\nstrategy will be effective only if the level of traffic\ncongestion is not excessive and vehicles progress\ndownstream in a platoon through coordinated traffic signals\nat B, C, D, and E (Figure 16) on every signal cycle.\nIn general, if vehicular volumes are relatively high,\ntraffic signals along a roadway corridor with an LRT\ncrossing (like the one shown in Figure 16) should be\ncoordinated to allow motor vehicles to progress in platoons.\nTraffic queues are more easily managed if motor vehicles\ntravel in platoons along the corridor. New strategies using\nIntelligent\nTransportation System (ITS) technology to precondition the\ntraffic signal coordination along the corridor around the\npredicted arrival time of LRVs at the crossing based on\nexact, real-time LRV position information (possibly using\nGlobal Positioning System (GPS) satellites) are becoming\navailable. With commonly used technology, it is possible to\nhold LRVs approaching the crossing at LRT stations on\neither side of the roadway corridor; however, the LRT\nagency needs to be willing to tolerate some minor delays.\nLRVs would only proceed toward the crossing on a\nfavorable wayside signal so that they arrive between motor\nvehicle platoons.\n5.\nClear-Out Traffic Signal Phasing. On roadway\napproaches where motor vehicles must first travel through\nan\nLRT\ncrossing\nbefore\nreaching\nthe\nsignalized\nintersection, provide green traffic signal indications with\nprotected left turn indications (green arrows) to clear motor\nvehicles off the tracks during preemption (see Figure 17).\nThese green left-turn indications allow motorists queued\nback toward the tracks to clear the intersection without\nhesitation (i.e., motorists do not have to judge whether\nopposite direction traffic [approaching the LRT crossing]\nwill stop). This traffic control treatment is only necessary if\nthe crossing roadway handles two-way traffic and\ncontinues across the signalized intersection. For example, if\nthe crossing roadway terminates at the signalized\nintersection (creating a \"T\" intersection), only green traffic\nsignal indications (without protected turn phases) are\nnecessary during preemption to clear vehicles off the\ntracks.\nAs an alternative to providing protected left-turn\nsignal indications, the left turn onto the parallel roadway\ncould be prohibited at all times using No Left Turn signs\n(R3-2). However, if left turns were previously allowed\nprior to LRT implementation, a turn prohibition may be\nundesirable.33 Motorists may still attempt to make the\nnewly prohibited movement and would thus queue on the\nLRT tracks.\n6.\nMotor Vehicle Turn Treatments. At signalized\nintersections located adjacent to an LRT crossing, control\nmotor vehicles turning left and right from the parallel\nroadway onto the crossing roadway toward the LRT\ncrossing (see Figure 18). The most applicable type of turn\ncontrol during\n33According to the research findings presented in TCRP Report 17,\n\"Integration of Light Rail Transit into City Streets\" (Transportation Research\nBoard, National Research Council, Washington, D C [1996] p. 67), LRT\nsystem design should attempt to maintain existing traffic and travel patterns,\nunless a specific urban design change is desired (e.g, converting a street into\na pedestrian mall) If existing traffic patterns are changed when LRT is\nimplemented, the crossing user's expectancy may be violated Despite\nrestrictions or limitations (e g, left-turn prohibitions), motorists and\npedestrians often try to use the travel routes they used before LRT was\nimplemented. In some cases, this type of violation is committed not\nintentionally but rather out of habit Moreover, by using these old routes,\nmotorists and pedestrians may be placing themselves in a risky situation\nwhen an LRV is approaching or present.\n\nFigure 17. Protected left-turn indication to clear vehicles off the tracks.\nFigure 18. Turning movements for control.\n\n____________________\n_______________________\npreemption depends on the traffic control devices used to\ncontrol turns when an LRV is not approaching the crossing\n(if any). The preferred devices to control right and left turns\ntoward an LRT crossing are standard traffic signals\ndisplaying protected indications (right/left-turn arrows). If\nthe turning movements shown in Figure 18 are protected by\ntraffic\nsignal\nindications\n(usually\nprotected\nsignal\nindications are used where right/left-turn pockets [bays] are\nprovided), LRV-activated LRV Approaching signs34 may\nbe used to warn motorists of the increased risk associated\nwith violating the regulatory devices--the red arrow\n(protected) traffic signal indications--when an LRV\napproaches the crossing.\nIf the turning movements shown in Figure 18 are\npermissive (i.e., they are not controlled by arrow traffic\nsignal indications) or the nearby intersection is controlled\nby STOP signs (R1-1), LRV-activated No Right/Left Turn\nsigns (R31, 2) should be used to prohibit these movements\nwhen an LRV approaches the crossing. LRV-activated No\nRight/ Left Turn signs (R3-1, 2) should not be used in\nconjunction with arrow traffic signal indications.\n7.\nDiagonal Crossing Provisions. At those signalized\nintersections where the LRT tracks cross two approach\nroadways (i.e., a diagonal crossing as shown in Figure 19),\ndetect an approaching LRV (usually through some sort of\ntrack detection circuitry) far enough in advance to allow\nmotor vehicles to clear the tracks on both approaches prior\nto the LRV arriving at the first of the two crossings.\nAlternatively, use the queue prevention strategies described\nabove (e.g., use pre-signals). That is, instead of allowing\nqueues to build back across the tracks from the intersection\nand then clearing both roadway approaches, prevent queues\nfrom forming by keeping the LRT tracks clear of vehicles\nunder all normal conditions by using pre-signals on both\napproaches.\nAlso as shown in Figure 19, it may be more\nappropriate to install the automatic gates so that they\ndescend parallel to the LRT tracks, rather than\nperpendicular to the crossing roadway, depending on the\nangle of the LRT crossing with respect to the crossing\nroadway approach. Under some crossing configurations, if\nthe automatic gates are placed perpendicular to the crossing\nroadway, some motorists may stop between the automatic\ngate arm and the LRT tracks. This creates a dilemma for\nthe LRV operator who must decide if the motorist is going\nto remain stopped or will advance across the tracks.\nAutomatic gate placement guidelines are discussed further\nin Section 6.1.\n8.\nSecond LRV Approaching. Traffic signal controllers\nshould be programmed to remain in the appropriate phase\nor\n34The most current draft version of the new Part X, \"Traffic\nControls for Highway-Light Rail Transit Grade Crossings,\" dated\nFebruary 16, 1997, of the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control\nDevices for Streets and Highways (MUTCD) calls this sign W10\nZZ. It displays the front view of an LRV in yellow with a black\nbackground. The sign is intended to be an LRV-activated blank-out\ntype sign with dimensions of 600 mm (24 in.) x 600 mm (24 in.).\nphases following the motor vehicle track clearance period\n(either all red, flashing all red, or limited service operation\nas described above) and the automatic gate should remain\ndown if a second, opposite direction LRV is detected\napproaching the crossing while the first LRV is passing\nthrough the crossing (still in the crossing circuit). This\ncontrol logic is depicted on timeline A in Figure 20.\nFurther, the LRV detection system should be designed to\nprevent the automatic gates from going halfway up and\nthen when a second, opposite direction LRV is detected,\ngoing back down35. That is, the automatic gates should be\ntimed to remain down if a second LRV is detected\napproaching the crossing within about 10 sec after the first\none clears. It takes approximately 10 sec (or less) for an\nautomatic gate arm to move from horizontal to vertical.\nAccordingly, the traffic signals should remain in the phase\nor phases following the motor vehicle track clearance\nperiod (either all red, flashing all red, or limited service\noperation). This control strategy essentially requires that\nLRVs are detected about 10 sec prior to the normal\ndetection point for automatic gate/ flashing light signal\nactivation or for advance preemption (to terminate other\nphases less abruptly). This control logic is depicted on\ntimeline B in Figure 20.\nA sample logic for the second LRV approaching could\nwork as follows: An LRV is detected approaching a\ncrossing at the first advance detection point. If there is no\nopposite direction LRV approaching the crossing, in the\ncrossing, or just clearing the crossing, nothing happens\nuntil the LRV reaches a second advance detection point.\nThe traffic signal controller would then start the requisite\npedestrian and motor vehicle clearance phases, and at the\nstandard (third) LRV detection point (about 20 sec before\nthe LRV arrives at the crossing), the flashing light signals\nand automatic gates would activate. Depending on the\nmotor vehicle and pedestrian clearance requirements at the\nsignalized intersection, the second LRV detection point\nmay not be necessary, in which case there would only be\none early detection point, about 10 sec prior to the standard\nLRV detection point. On the other hand, if there is an LRV\nin any of the three aforementioned locations when the LRV\nin question reaches the first advance detection point, the\ntraffic signals would remain in their predefined holding\nsequences following the first track clearance phase (all red,\nflashing all red, or limited service operation) and the\nautomatic gates would remain down until the last LRV\nclears the crossing36 and the gates ascend fully.\nIdeally, a longer overlap period for the advanced\ncircuit (first early detection point) would be beneficial\nbecause more advanced treatments could be employed. A\nlonger overlap period would minimize motorist confusion,\nincrease pedestrian safety, and benefit the traffic signal\ncontroller.\n35This action is commonly referred to as automatic gate \"pumping\".\n36It may be possible to accomplish this same gate pumping prevention\nstrategy using vital (\"fail-safe\") timers instead of three separate LRV\ndetection points along the track.\n\n_______________________\nFigure 19. Example diagonal LRT crossing.\nOne possibility would be to extend the advanced circuit to a\ndistance equal to the time length required to complete one\ncycle of signal phasing. The downfall to this is that the time\nrequired to complete one cycle could push the advanced\ndetection point more than 1 mi away from the grade\ncrossing. With current technology, this would be\nimpractical. Therefore, more research is needed to address\nthis issue including the possibility of applying GPS\ntechnology to grade crossing advance detection. The results\nof ongoing research of GPS in freight railroad applications\nshould be applied to LRT systems in order to increase the\noverlap period for the advanced circuit.\nAs shown on time lines A, B, and C in Figure 20, the\npreemption call to the traffic signal controller should be\nreleased when the automatic gates are in their full, upright\nposition. This preemption release treatment causes the\ndownstream traffic signals to remain red until the automatic\ngates are vertical. The Uniform Vehicle Code and Model\nTraffic Ordinance, Section 11-70137 states that \"no person\nshall drive a vehicle through, around or under any crossing\n37Uniform Vehicle Code and Model Traffic Ordinance, National Committee\non Uniform Traffic Laws and Ordinances, Evanston, Illinois (1992) p. 81.\n\nFigure 20. Second LRV advance detection.\n\n_______________________\n___________________\ngate or barrier at a railroad crossing while such gate or\nbarrier is closed or is being opened or closed\"38. Thus, it\nmay be confusing to motorists if downstream traffic signals\ndisplay green indications, even though motorists are\nrequired by law to remain stopped until the gates are in\ntheir vertical position. Further, it is generally better to\npositively control motorists operating near LRT crossings\nand not leave the decision to the motorist as to when it is\nsafe to proceed under a moving automatic gate arm.\nIf an automatic gate pumping prevention strategy is\nused as recommended in this section, holding the\npreemption call in the traffic signal controller until the\nautomatic gates are vertical presents no problem for a\ntraffic\nsignal\ncontroller\naccepting\na\nsecond\nLRT\npreemption. As shown on timeline C in Figure 20, when the\nautomatic gates start to ascend, the system already knows\nthat there will not be another LRT preemption for at least\n10 sec39.\nFor new LRT systems where it is necessary to\ninterconnect the LRV detection system with an existing\ntraffic signal controller (to preempt the traffic signals when\nan LRV approaches), special consideration should be given\nto ensure that the traffic signal controller can execute all\nnecessary and desired preemption routines. Experience at\nvarious LRT systems suggests that some older traffic signal\ncontrollers may not offer the flexibility necessary to\nappropriately and safely accommodate LRT preemption. If\nolder traffic signal controllers are too restrictive, new ones\nshould be installed as part of LRT system design.\n9.\nLRT Vis A Vis Emergency Vehicle Preemption. Per the\nManual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices for Streets and\nHighways, Section 8C-6,40 \"Where multiple or successive\n38Some states like California allow motorists to proceed across the tracks\nwhile the gate is in motion If this is the case, it may be more desirable to\ndiscontinue the preemption call to the traffic signal controller as soon as the\nautomatic gates start to move upward. The 1995 California Vehicle Code,\nSection 22451, simply states that 'no driver shall proceed through, around, or\nunder any railroad or rail transit crossing gate while the gate is closed.'\n39The National Committee on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (NCUTCD)\nHighway-Railroad Grade Crossing Technical Committee has issued a\nrecommendation for potential inclusion in the Manual on Uniform Traffic\nControl Devices for Streets and Highways to establish and maintain the\npreemption condition between the time the crossing signals are first\nactivated and the time the crossing gates first begin to raise after the train\nhas cleared the crossing. Their recommendation is inconsistent with the\nrecommendations above. They reason that traffic signal controllers, even\nthose programmed to go to railroad track clear as soon as they receive a\nsecond railroad preempt call, cannot accept a second railroad preempt call\nuntil the first preemption call has been discontinued (either as the gates start\nup or are fully up) Therefore, at those traffic signals which are\ninterconnected, the traffic signal controllers can accept a second preemption\ncall earlier if the preemption call ceases when the gates first start up.\nHowever, if a gate pumping prevention strategy is used as recommended for\nLRT, the traffic signal controller will not need to accept a second\npreemption call for at least 10 sec after the first one is released.\n40Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices for Streets and Highways, U.S\nDepartment\nof\nTransportation,\nFederal\nHighway\nAdministration,\nWashington, D C (1988) p. 8C-7.\npreemption may occur from differing modes, train\nactuation should receive first priority and emergency\nvehicles second priority.\" This recommendation applies at\nhigher speed LRT crossings (LRVs operating at speeds\ngreater than 55 km/h [35 mph]) where the LRV detection\nsystem is interconnected with the traffic signals at a nearby\nintersection.\n10. Traffic Signal Recovery from Preemption. If possible,\ntraffic signals at intersections located adjacent to LRT\ncrossings should be programmed so that the protected left\nturns from the parallel street (if any) follow the parallel\nstreet through movements (this is commonly referred to as\n\"lagging left turns\"). Further, these traffic signals should\nrecover from an LRT preemption (after the last LRV clears\nthe crossing) to the lagging left turns on the parallel street.\nBecause these left turns routinely follow the parallel street\nthough movements, the next logical phase after serving the\nparallel street left turns is to either serve the protected left\nturns on the crossing roadway (if any) or the through\nmovements on the crossing roadway. The left turns from\nthe parallel roadway and the cross street traffic (all\nmovements) will probably be delayed the most by LRT\npreemption because the parallel street through movements\ncan be served during LRT preemption under limited service\noperations described above. If motorists are delayed\nextensively though multiple preemptions and recovery\ncycles (the first cycle after the preemption call is released),\nthey may become impatient and violate the crossing control\ndevices.\nAlternatively, more advanced strategies would allow\nthe traffic signal controller to remember the point in the\nsignal cycle that was interrupted by LRT preemption. If\nmost of the time (e.g., 95 percent) on the interrupted phase\nwas served prior to LRT preemption, that phase could be\nskipped on the recovery cycle. On the other hand, if only a\nsmall portion of the time (e.g., 5 percent) for the interrupted\nphase was served when the signals were interrupted, the\ntraffic signal controller could then recover to that phase.\nExisting traffic signal controllers may not be able to\naccommodate more advanced routines such as the one just\ndescribed; thus, it may be necessary to install new traffic\nsignal controllers as part of LRT system design.\n6 AUTOMATIC GATE PLACEMENT GUIDELINES\nThe Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices for\nStreets and Highways (MUTCD), Section 8C-4,\ndescribes both the physical characteristics and operation of\nautomatic gates. Section 6 of this report discusses\nautomatic gate placement with respect to the angle of the\ncrossing roadway and the LRT tracks and pedestrian\nsidewalks (if present) or roadway shoulders.\n41 Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices for Streets and Highways\nU.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Highway Administration,\nWashington, D.C. (1988) pp. 8C-3,4,5.\n\n________________________\n________________________\n6.1 Automatic Gate Placement--Angle\nTypical location plans for automatic gates are shown\nin Figure 8-7 of the MUTCD, Section 8C-442. For all\ncrossing angles (i.e., the angle which the tracks cross with\nthe roadway) shown in this figure, the automatic gate arms\ndescend perpendicular to the direction of motor vehicle\ntravel. In general, automatic gates are installed in this\nconfiguration to maximize their visibility to approaching\nmotorists. Specifically, the reflectorized red and white\nstripes on the gate arms are most visible when light from\napproaching motor vehicle headlamps reflect off at a 90\ndeg angle43. However, in some instances (described below),\nit may improve safety to install the automatic gates parallel\nto the LRT alignment (or more nearly so), rather than\nperpendicular to the direction of motor vehicle travel,\nespecially where there is an immediately adjacent, parallel\nroadway.\nIf the automatic gates are installed parallel to the\ntracks at angled LRT crossings (so that the automatic gates\ndo not descend perpendicular to the crossing roadway), the\nflashing light signals and small red lights located on top of\nthe gate arm should be aligned to provide maximum\nvisibility to approaching motorists. Depending on the\nvisibility conditions on the roadway approach and general\ncrossing geometry, supplemental flashing light signals\nmounted in the roadway median or overhead on a\ncantilever would enhance LRT crossing visibility. Also, if\ninstalled parallel to the LRT tracks at a severely angled\ncrossing, the gate arm length necessary to cover all traffic\nlanes may be excessive. Experience suggests a maximum\ngate arm length of about 12 m (38 ft) for practical operation\nand maintenance. At those crossings requiring the gate arm\nto be longer than 12 m (38 ft)--as may be necessary if they\nare installed parallel to the LRT alignment at an angled\ncrossing--a second automatic gate should be installed in the\nroadway median (i.e., in a median with barrier curbs) also\nparallel to the LRT alignment.\nWith this background, the following guidelines\naddress automatic gate placement issues with respect to the\nangle they are installed relative to the LRT tracks and\napproaching motorists.\n42Other sources include the Railroad-Highway Grade Crossing Handbook,\nSecond Edition (U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Highway\nAdministration, Washington, D.C. [1986] pp. 111-114), the Traffic Control\nDevices Handbook (U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Highway\nAdministration, Washington, D C [1983] pp. 8-24-8-30), and the Association\nof American Railroads Signal Manual (Association of American Railroads,\nWashington, D.C. [1996] Part 3.1.36A-3.1.37).\n43Special retroreflective (reflectivity that bounces light back to its source)\nsheeting is available that provides virtually complete nighttime reflectivity at\nangles up to about 45 deg (between a line perpendicular to the roadway\napproach and the automatic gate arm). This sheeting also provides relatively\ngood nighttime reflectivity at angles up to about 60 deg For most oblique\nLRT crossings, this type of retroreflective sheeting in alternating red and\nwhite angled stripes (per the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices for\nStreets and Highways [Figure 8-5, p 8C-4]) placed on the automatic gate\narm makes installing the mechanism parallel to the tracks more feasible. For\nfurther details, contact 3M Traffic Control Materials Division or another\nreflective sheeting manufacturer.\n1.\nIf installing the automatic gates perpendicular to\napproaching motorists increases the likelihood that\nmotorists may stop short of the LRT tracks (out of the LRV\ndynamic envelope44) but beyond the automatic gate arms45,\ninstall them so that they descend parallel to the LRT\nalignment. As shown in Figure 21 on both sides A and B,\nthe automatic gates must be installed 3.7 m (12 ft)\nminimum from the centerline of the nearest track, measured\nperpendicular to that track's centerline. If the automatic\ngates are installed perpendicular to the direction of\napproaching motorists (Side A of Figure 21) and the LRT\ntracks cross the roadway at an angle (A in Figure 21), the\ndistance between the automatic gate arm(s) and the LRV\ndynamic envelope could be as long as 10 m (33 ft). The\nexact distance depends on the angle of the crossing as well\nas the number and width of the traffic lanes (Li in Figure\n21).\nA motorist driving a standard automobile with a length\nof about 5.5 m (18 ft) could easily stop past the automatic\ngate arm, but short of the LRV dynamic envelope.\nAlthough a motorist stopped in this location will not collide\nwith an approaching LRV, the LRV operator must\ndetermine if the motorist will advance across the tracks. A\nmotorist stopped in this position may panic, not knowing\nwhether the motor vehicle is actually clear of an\napproaching LRV, given that it is on the wrong side of a\nclosed automatic gate. Moreover, a truck attempting to stop\nshort of the LRT tracks when the flashing light signals first\nactivate (usually about 3 to 5 seconds before the automatic\ngates start to descend) may actually stop past the automatic\ngate arms, short of the LRT tracks. In this case, the\nautomatic gates descend onto the roof of the truck.\nSide B of Figure 21 illustrates an automatic gate\ninstalled parallel to the LRT alignment (3.7 m (12 ft)\naway). The distance between the gate arm and the LRV\ndynamic envelope will typically be no more than about 2.6\nm (8.5 ft), not allowing motorists to stop in this zone\nwithout being clearly on the LRT tracks. Note that this 2.6\nm (8.5 ft) distance remains constant for all traffic lanes on\nthe approach and is independent of the crossing angle, a,\nand the lane widths, Li.\n2.\nAt angled LRT crossings with an immediately\nadjacent parallel roadway (Figure 22), install the automatic\ngates parallel to the LRT alignment (rather than\nperpendicular to approaching motorists) to more effectively\nblock left turns\n44The dynamic envelope of an LRV is the clearance on either side of a\nmoving LRV that precludes any contact from taking place as a result of any\ncondition of design wear, loading, or anticipated failure, such as air-spring\ndeflation or normal vehicle lateral motion (TCRP Report 17, \"Integration of\nLight Rail Transit into City Streets,\" Transportation Research Board,\nNational Research Council, Washington, D C.\n[1996] p.\n84)\n45Conditions likely to cause motorists to stop in this position include\ncrossings where the tracks and the roadway intersect at an angle other than\n90 deg, a heavily used driveway immediately downstream of crossing, a\ncross street immediately downstream of the crossing, etc.\n\nFigure 21. Acute angle crossing automatic gate placement.\n\nFigure 22. Automatic gate placement for turning traffic.\nfrom the parallel roadway through the crossing. As an\nalternative to installing automatic gates parallel to the LRT\nalignment, left turns can be prohibited (using No Left-Turn\nsigns [R3-2]) and roadway channelization designed to\ndiscourage left-turn movements.\n3.\nTo better control motor vehicles turning from a street\nparallel to the LRT alignment, install turn automatic gates\nparallel to the LRT tracks, rather than perpendicular to\napproaching motorists (which, in this case, would also be\nperpendicular to the LRT tracks). Figures 23 through 26\nillustrate locations where installing the automatic gates to\ndescend parallel to the LRT tracks provides better\nprotection for turning motorists. If the automatic gates are\ninstalled perpendicular to approaching motor vehicles,\nmotorists may stop beyond the gate arm while waiting to\nenter the crossing roadway's traffic stream (Figures 23 and\n25). An example of this behavior is shown at an LRT\ncrossing in Figure 26.\n\nFigure 23. Left-turn automatic gate placement.\nThe gate arm could either descend behind the stopped\nmotorist (the motorist would then be stopped between the\nhorizontal gate arm and the LRV dynamic envelope) or\nperhaps on the roof of the motor vehicle. As above, the\nmotorist may panic and turn into the path of an approaching\nLRV.\nFor left turns across the LRT alignment from a parallel\nroadway, placing the automatic gates parallel to the LRT\nalignment essentially creates a four-quadrant automatic\ngate system. However, a gap between the tip of the left-turn\ngate and the primary crossing roadway gate (see Figure 23)\nshould be considered in order to allow motorists to escape\nfrom the track area if necessary. This concept of turning the\nleft-turn automatic gates parallel to the LRT alignment was\npioneered by the Calgary LRT system (see Figure 24).\nOriginally, their left-turn gates were installed perpendicular\nto the left turning traffic. However, the gates routinely\ndescended onto the roof of any motor vehicle stopped\nbeyond the striped Stop Bar. After trying some special\nwarning signs, Calgary Transit turned the gates parallel to\nthe LRT alignment. In this position, the gates have proven\neffective and no longer strike the roofs of stopped motor\nvehicles. A gap between the left-turn gate and the standard\ncross-traffic gate allows motor vehicles to exit the track\narea if necessary. Calgary Transit uses left-turn automatic\ngates on both\n\nFigure 24. Example quasi-four-quadrant gate system.\nsides of its LRT alignment (on 36 Street NE) along with the\nroadway would be stopped early, allowing motorists who\nstandard automatic gates, forming a \"quasi\" four-quadrant\nmay be stopped beyond the turn automatic gate to enter the\ngate system (\"quasi\" because of the gap).\ncrossing roadway before the gate descends onto the roof of\nAs an alternative to installing left-turn gates parallel to\nthe motor vehicle.\nthe LRT alignment, left turns could be prohibited at all\ntimes using No Left Turn signs (R3-2) and appropriate\n6.2 Automatic Gate Placement--Sidewalk/Shoulder\nmotor vehicle channelization. Also, a timing plan could be\ndeveloped to lower the automatic gates for the crossing\nIn general, automatic gates should be installed behind\nroadway several seconds before the turn gate, depending on\nthe sidewalk (on the side away from the curb) or paved\nthe specific site in question. Using this strategy, traffic on\nshoulder (if no sidewalk is present) where right-of-way\nthe crossing\n\nFigure 25. Right-turn automatic gate placement.\nconditions permit. In this fashion, the gate arm would\nextend across the sidewalk/shoulder in two of the four LRT\ncrossing quadrants, blocking pedestrians from passing\nwhen an LRV is approaching. Longer and lighter gate arms\nmake this installation feasible. However, experience\nsuggests a maximum gate arm length of 12 m (38 ft) for\npractical operation and maintenance. At those crossings\nrequiring the gate arm to be longer than 12 m (38 ft), a\nsecond automatic gate should be placed in a barrier curb-\ntype median. Most LRT agencies already have design\nguidelines (for retrofitting or expanding their existing\nsystem) that specify\nautomatic gates be installed behind pedestrian sidewalks\nwhere possible.\nUnder conditions where placing the automatic gate\nassembly behind the sidewalk/paved shoulder also limits\nthe visibility of flashing light signals mounted on the same\nassembly, other alternatives should be considered such as\n(1) installing supplemental flashing light signals in the\nroadway median (using barrier-type curbs) or on a\ncantilever over the roadway or (2) installing the automatic\ngates curbside and using separate pedestrian automatic\ngates to block the sidewalk or paved shoulder (see the\ndiscussion in the next\n\n________________________\n______________________\nFigure 26. Motor vehicle stopped on wrong side of gate arm.\nsection on pedestrian automatic gates). If the second option\nis considered, pedestrian automatic gates should also be\ninstalled in the two other quadrants of the LRT crossing (in\nthe two quadrants without vehicle automatic gates),\nblocking all four pedestrian approaches to the LRT\ncrossing.\n7 PEDESTRIAN CONTROL GUIDELINES\nAs documented in TCRP Report 17, \"Integration of\nLight Rail Transit into City Streets46,\" although collisions\nbetween LRVs and pedestrians occur less often than\ncollisions between LRVs and motor vehicles, they are\nusually more severe. Further, pedestrians are not\ncompletely alert to their surroundings at all times, and\nLRVs are nearly silent even at higher speeds. Also, most\npedestrians will attempt to take the shortest reasonable path\nbetween where they are and where they want to go. Thus,\nunless adequate controls are installed, pedestrians will often\njaywalk, cross diagonally though an LRT crossing, or\ntrespass along the LRT right-of-way if this path is the\nshortest and saves time.\nFor these reasons, appropriate pedestrian controls are\ncritical for LRT safety. For example, most LRT systems\nconstructed since 1993 (e.g., St. Louis and Dallas) use\nsome form of pedestrian control at crossings where LRVs\noperate at speeds greater than 55 km/h (35 mph). Table 3\npresents\n46TCRP Report 17, \"Integration of Light Rail Transit into City Streets,\"\nTransportation Research Board, National Research Council, Washington, D\nC.\n(1996) p 74.\npedestrian control devices in use or planned for use at the\n11 LRT systems surveyed as part of this project. In some\ncases, pedestrian control means allowing certain pedestrian\nmovements along the shortest path (not prohibiting them),\nbut engineering those movements to enhance safety. For\nexample, instead of attempting to stop pedestrians from\nwalking (trespassing) along the LRT right-of-way between\ntwo points, it may be more appropriate to engineer a\npedestrian pathway that is separated from the LRT tracks\n(maybe with a fence) yet within the right-of-way. In this\nfashion, pedestrians can be accommodated with enhanced\nsafety instead of trying to prohibit them all together. Even\nwith fencing along the length of the right-of-way,\ntrespassers will simply enter at an LRT crossing, using the\nright-of-way as the shortest distance between origin and\ndestination.\nThe following guidelines are for specific types of\npedestrian control devices (i.e., pedestrian automatic gates,\nswing gates, pedestrian channelization devices, pedestrian\nsigns, and audible pedestrian warnings). They are based on\nthe operating experience of the 11 LRT agencies as\noutlined in Table 3 above.\nPedestrian Automatic Gates. In general, pedestrian\nautomatic gates47 should be installed at all pedestrian\ncrossings (sidewalks or other designated pathways) with\nlimited sight\n47Pedestrian automatic gates are the same as standard automatic gates except\nthe gate arms are shorter. When activated by an approaching LRV, the\nautomatic gates physically block pedestrians from crossing the LRT tracks.\n\n______________________\nTABLE 3 Pedestrian control devices by LRT system\n(a) Excludes typical Look Both Ways for Trains signs and excludes standard audible devices such as mechanical railroad bells.\n(b) Various LRV-activated Second Train Approaching type signs being tested as part of TCRP Project A-5a.\n(c) LRV-activated DANGER - 2ND TRAIN APPROACHING sign\n(d) LRV-activated CAUTION SECOND TRAIN APPROACHING sign.\ndistance (see Figure 7). As shown in Figure 7, limited sight\ndistance means that pedestrians cannot see an approaching\nLRV until it is very close to the crossing and that LRV\noperators cannot see pedestrians in the vicinity of the\ncrossing until the LRV is very close. When this condition\nexists, pedestrian automatic gates are essential. For\nexample, if a pedestrian crossing is only controlled by\nflashing light signals and bells, a pedestrian can enter the\ntrack area despite activated warning devices, thinking that\nan LRV is not really approaching the crossing because\nthere is no visual contact. In fact, the LRV is approaching\nthe crossing, but because of obstructions, the pedestrian\ncannot see the LRV and the LRV operator cannot see the\npedestrian. Pedestrian automatic gates take away the\npedestrian's decision on whether to cross the tracks or wait\nuntil the LRV passes.\nIn accordance with Section 6.2 above and TCRP\nReport 17, \"Integration of Light Rail Transit into City\nStreets,\"48 Figure 27 illustrates the recommended placement\nof pedestrian automatic gates where there is a sidewalk.\nSide A of Figure 27 (recommended) shows the automatic\ngate for vehicles installed behind the pedestrian sidewalk\n(away from the curb). In the crossing quadrant without a\nvehicle automatic gate, a single-unit pedestrian automatic\ngate is also installed behind the sidewalk (away from the\ncurb). As an alternative, Side B of Figure 27 shows the\nvehicle automatic gate installed curbside with a pedestrian\nautomatic gate sharing the same assembly. In this case, a\nseparate drive mechanism should be provided for the\npedestrian automatic gate so that a failure in the pedestrian\nautomatic gate unit will not affect vehicle automatic gate\noperations. To provide four\n48TCRP Report 17, \"Integration of Light Rail Transit into City Streets,\"\nTransportation Research Board, National Research Council, Washington,\nD.C (1996)p 80\nquadrant warning, a single-unit pedestrian automatic gate\nshould also be installed on the curbside of the sidewalk,\nacross the tracks, opposite the vehicle automatic gate and\npedestrian automatic gate joint assembly.\nTo warn pedestrians of the presence of a lowered gate\narm during low visibility conditions, two red warning\nlights, 100 mm (4 in.) in diameter, should be placed on top\nof the gate arm. These lights should flash at the same\nfrequency as the warning lights on top of the motorists'\nautomatic gate arm. Another possibility is to place the\nwarning lights below the automatic pedestrian gate arm\n(e.g., Calgary) to give the pedestrian a better sense of the\nposition of the gate arm as it lowers. The use of warning\nlights on gate arms is recommended as a visual warning to\npedestrians because the reflective striping on the gate arm\nmay be ineffective if there is no light source (e.g.,\nheadlight) illuminating the gate arm.\nFigure 28 shows a typical pedestrian automatic gate\ninstallation on the St. Louis and Dallas LRT systems. As\nshown in the Dallas example, at some locations, depending\non the type of pedestrians typically using the crossing, a\nskirt should be added under the automatic gate arm where it\nis desirable to discourage pedestrians from walking or\nducking under it. In Dallas, pedestrian automatic gates with\nskirts are used at two LRT crossings near an elementary\nschool.\nSwing Gates--Manual. Where there is a defined pedestrian\npathway (e.g., at a station location or sidewalk), swing\ngates should be used to alert pedestrians to the LRT tracks\nby forcing them to pause before crossing, deterring them\nfrom walking or running freely across the tracks without\nunduly restricting their exit from the track area. Swing\ngates require pedestrians to pull a gate to enter the crossing\nand to push a gate to exit the protected track area; therefore,\na pedestrian cannot physically cross the tracks without\npulling\n\nFigure 27. Placement of pedestrian automatic gates.\nopen the gate. The gates should be designed to return to the\nclosed position after the pedestrian has passed. Figure 29\nillustrates typical swing gate installations on the Los\nAngeles and Calgary LRT systems.\nGenerally, swing gates should be used where\npedestrians are likely to dart across the LRT tracks without\nlooking\nboth ways. The Los Angeles LRT system effectively uses\nswing gates in conjunction with active warning devices\n(e.g., flashing light signals and bells). If active warning\ndevices are not provided at the crossing, sight distance must\nbe adequate for a pedestrian to have just entered the\ncrossing, see an approaching LRV, and pass to a refuge\narea (usually the\n\nFigure 28. Example pedestrian automatic gates.\nother side of the tracks) prior to the LRV arriving in the\ncrossing. Typical locations for swing gates include\ncrossings in LRT stations (where pedestrians may forget\nabout LRVs given that they just alighted from one) or in or\nnear transit system transfer stations (where pedestrians may\nrush to board another mode of transportation).\nBesides forcing pedestrians to take a physical action\nprior to entering the track area, swing gates provide a\npositive barrier: if pedestrians are on the other side of the\ngates when an LRV approaches, they will know without a\ndoubt they are clear of the tracks and will not get hit. Swing\ngates provide an extra level of comfort for pedestrians at\nhigher\n\n___________________\nFigure 29. Example manual swing gates.\nspeed LRT crossings. In fact, a survey of pedestrians using\nswing gates at the Imperial/Wilmington station on the Los\nAngeles LRT system (the Long Beach Metro Blue Line)\nindicates that more than three-fourths (77 percent) of those\ninterviewed believe the pedestrian crossings are safer with\nthe gates and almost all (90 percent) believed that swing\ngates should be installed at all Metro Blue Line stations\nwhere pedestrians cross the tracks49.\n49Metro Blue Line Grade Crossing Safety Improvement Program, Evaluation\nof Pedestrian Swing Gates at the Imperial Highway Station, Los Angeles\nCounty Metropolitan Transportation Authority, Los Angeles (1995) p.13\n\nSwing Gates--Automatic. Unlike manually operated swing\ngates, automatic swing gates do not require a positive\naction by a pedestrian to enter the crossing. The gate is\nnormally held open (under power) exposing a walkway\nacross the tracks as in Figure 30.\nWhen activated by an LRV approaching the grade\ncrossing, the gate closes, while at the same time exposing\nthe emergency exit. After the LRV passes, the gate opens,\nexposing the walkway permitting access across the tracks\nand\nFigure 30. Example automatic swing gates.\nat the same time closing off the emergency exit. Under\npower failure conditions, the swing gate will automatically\nclose under spring tension. Used widely in Australia,\nautomatic swing gates have been successful in fatality\nprevention and operational reliability.\n3.\nPedestrian\nChannelization\n(Z-Crossing).\nWhere\npossible, channel pedestrians to cross higher speed LRT\ntracks at designated locations only. However, when\nconsidering\n\n_________________________\n_________________________\nlocations for pedestrian channelization across the LRT\ntracks, pre-existing pedestrian travel patterns should be\nmaintained where possible, considering any sight distance\nlimitations (see Figure 7). One of the most common types\nof pedestrian channelization is the Z-crossing. Z-crossings\nare designed to turn pedestrians toward an approaching\nLRV before they cross each track (or at least the nearest\ntrack, depending on the design), forcing them to look in the\ndirection of oncoming LRVs (see Figure 31). Z-crossings\nmay be used at isolated pedestrian crossings located away\nfrom highway-LRT crossings (like the St. Louis example in\nFigure 31) or at standard highway-LRT crossings (like the\nCalgary example in Figure 31).\nZ-crossings should only be used at pedestrian\ncrossings with adequate sight distance (if pedestrians are\nturned to face approaching LRVs but cannot see them\nbecause of obstructions, the Z-crossing becomes useless).\nFurther, Z-crossings should not be used where LRVs\noperate in both directions on a single track, because\npedestrians may be looking the wrong way in some\ninstances.\nPedestrians also look in the wrong direction during\nLRV reverse-running situations; however, because reverse\nrunning is performed at lower speeds and is typically only\nused during maintenance or emergency situations, it should\nnot be a deterrent to this channeling approach. Special\nconsideration should also be given to using Z-crossings\nnear end-of-the-line (terminal) LRT stations where LRVs\nmay be routinely reverse running into or out of the station.\nAs shown in Figure 32 (Dusseldorf, Germany), arrow\nstriping indicating the direction that LRVs typically\ntraverse the crossing may also help pedestrians look in the\nmost appropriate direction before walking into the track\narea. This arrow, if used, should be striped or otherwise\nplaced between the two rails for a given LRV direction\nimmediately upstream of the pedestrian pathway. This type\nof striping is appropriate for both Z-crossings (Figure 32)\nand swing gates.\n4.\nPedestrian Signage. Install pedestrian-only signs50\nbelow about 2 m (6.5 ft). These signs should be installed so\nthat pedestrians walking on the intended path will not strike\nthem. Often, pedestrian signs are mounted overhead as\nshown on the Los Angeles LRT system in Figure 33.\nAlthough this sign is visible while pedestrians approach\nfrom a distance, they cannot see it when they need it most,\nright as they are about to cross the tracks. A better solution\nis shown on the Boston LRT system51 in Figure 33. At this\nLRT crossing, the pedestrian warning sign is mounted near\nthe ground (where pedestrians tend to look while they are\nwalking) right at the track crossing.\n50Those signs intended for viewing only by pedestrians traveling along a\ndesignated path (e g, the sidewalk)\n51The Boston LRT system was surveyed as part of TCRP Project A-5 The\nreport of Project A-5 is TCRP Report 17, \"Integration of Light Rail Transit\ninto City Streets,\" Transportation Research Board, National Research\nCouncil, Washington, DC (1996).\n5.\nPedestrian Audio Warnings. At higher speed LRT\ncrossings controlled by flashing light signals and automatic\ngates where the LRT agency turns off the bell once the\nautomatic gates have descended, provide an alternative\naudio warning device. Cessation of the wayside crossing\nbells is sometimes necessary in residential neighborhoods\nwhere excessive noise is usually a concern. However, some\nform of audible wayside warning should be provided for\npedestrians with visual impairments. As an alternative to\ncrossing bells, small audio devices (similar to a back-up\nalarm on a truck, such as those found on portions of the\nSacramento LRT system) could be installed in the crossing\nhardware to warn pedestrians of an approaching LRV.\nThese small audio devices could be softer than a clanging\nbell and also focused on the sidewalk itself.52\nIn fact, some U.S. cities have installed similar devices\nat standard intersections to assist pedestrians with visual\nimpairments. When the WALK signals are displayed for\none crossing direction, the audible devices emit a \"chirp\nchirp\" sound and when the other direction is displayed, the\naudible devices emit a \"coo-coo.\" An example emitter\nlocated at an intersection in Oakland, California is shown in\nFigure 34.\n8 GUIDELINES FOR SELECTING AMONG\nPEDESTRIAN CROSSING CONTROL DEVICES\n8.1 Overview\nA wide range of pedestrian warning and control\ndevices are in use at the 11 LRT systems surveyed (see\nSection 7 on Pedestrian Control Guidelines). Devices\nsurveyed include the following:\n-\nTraditional railroad devices (e.g., bells, pedestrian\nautomatic gates, and flashing light signals),\n-\nTraditional traffic devices (e.g., pedestrian signal\nheads),\n-\nCustomized active warning devices (e.g., illuminated\nsigns, with or without audio devices),\n-\nModified devices (e.g., pedestrian automatic gates\nwith hanging extension bars or skirts),\n-\nSwing gates--manual or automatic,\n-\nChannelization\ndevices\n(e.g.,\nZ-crossings\nand\npedestrian barriers), and\n-\nPassive warning signs (e.g., crossbucks and legend\nsigns).\nIn several interviews, LRT system representatives\nexpressed concern that there is a lack of overall guidance\nfor\n52Use of LRV bells, whistles, and horns at higher speed LRT crossings\nvaries widely based on local practices, ranging from \"silent\" crossings\nduring the evening hours where the LRV operator only sounds the horn if\nthere is imminent danger to crossings where the LRV operator sounds the\nhorn in the \"long blast-long blast-short blast-long blast\" pattern all hours of\nthe day (every time the LRV passes through the crossing).\n\nFigure 31. Example pedestrian channelization.\n\nFigure 32. Example pedestrian crossing striping.\nselection from among competing devices for pedestrian\nenvironments. Despite the lack of standards, a level of\nconsistency can be observed in existing practice. The\nresearch team has developed recommended practices that\nreflect a combination of existing practices and of key\nunderlying factors that distinguish alternative conditions for\ndevice\nimplementation.\nThe\nrecommended\npractice\nidentifies available devices and provides a rational method\nfor device selection. Examples of typical and some special\ncircumstances are provided.\n8.2 Available Devices\nThe following types of devices are considered in this\nrecommendation.\nWarning Devices\nWarning devices consist of passive warning signs such\nas the conventional railroad crossbuck (R15-1), signs\ndepicting front or side view graphics of LRVs, and various\nactive devices, including LRV-activated, illuminated\n(\"blank out\") signs with verbal or graphic legends, flashing\nilluminated signs such as standard pedestrian crosswalk\nsignals (\"ped heads\"), flashing light signals, and audio\ndevices\n(e.g., bells, horns, and electronic synthesized sounds such\nas the \"chirp-chirp\"/\"coo-coo\" devices used in conjunction\nwith pedestrian signals to aid pedestrians with visual\nimpairments).\nThe research team believes that all crossings where\nLRV speeds are greater than 55 km/h (35 mph) should use\nactive warning devices in addition to passive signs. Where\npedestrian crossings occur parallel to a roadway involving\nLRT, there will be active warning devices associated with\nthe vehicular crossing that may satisfy some or all of the\nneed for active devices for the pedestrian movement.\nHowever, at locations such as isolated pedestrian crossings\nor bike path crossings, active devices should be provided to\nwarn pedestrians and bicyclists of the greater risk\nassociated with higher speed operation above 55 km/h (35\nmph).\nThe type of active warning devices to be used should\nbe consistent with the specific environment and the other\ndevices in use at the crossing:\n-\nSidewalks--At locations where other railroad-type\nwarning devices such as crossbucks and automatic\ncrossing gates are used to control the vehicular grade\ncrossing, the most consistent active devices for the\npedestrian movements will ordinarily consist of\nstandard flashing light signals and a bell. Because of\nconsiderations\n\nFigure 33. Pedestrian sign mounting examples.\nations associated with the Americans with Disabilities Act\n(ADA) in the United States, both visual and audio devices\nshould be used in conjunction with each other. In station\nareas, the crossing should include a Tactile Warning Strip\n(TWS), placed just clear of the dynamic envelope of the\nLRV. TWSs should also be installed\nwhere positive control devices (e.g., pedestrian automatic\ngates or swing gates) are required per the guidelines\npresented in Section 8.3 below (typically at crossings with\nrestricted sight distance). This type of crossing typically\noccurs where pedestrians traverse the LRT tracks on a\nsidewalk located alongside a crossing\n\n_______________________\nFigure 34. Alternate pedestrian audio device.\nroadway, which is associated with semi-exclusive,\ntype b.\n1 right-of-way.\n-\nCrosswalks--At\nlocations\nwhere\nvehicular-type\ndevices such as traffic signals are used to control the\nvehicular crossing, the most consistent active devices\nfor the pedestrian movements are the standard\npedestrian\nsignals.\nThe\nmost\nup-to-date\nimplementation of pedestrian signals includes an audio\ndevice which emits a \"coo-coo\" sound for travel along\none axis (north/south) and a \"chirp-chirp\" sound for\nthe other axis (east/west). The audio sound is provided\nduring the illuminated WALK phase of the active\nvisual device. This condition typically occurs where\nthe LRT is operating in an on-street alignment (semi\nexclusive alignment types b.2, b.3, and b.4) and the\npedestrian crossing is made in a crosswalk delineated\nwith pavement markings or contrasting and/or textured\npavement. In this application, the pedestrian signal\nprovides an indication for crossing both the parallel\nvehicular roadway as well as the LRT trackway.53\n53At locations where the pedestrian signals only control movements across\nthe LRT trackway, such that the WALK indication would be displayed at all\ntimes except when LRVs are on approach or traversing the crossing,\ncontinuous sounding of the audio device in conjunction with the visual\nWALK display is impractical. An alternative solution is to provide the audio\nsound associated with the WALK phase for a measured interval after train\npassage, in conjunction with an audio warning device such as a bell or horn\nwarning pedestrians during the DONT WALK period.\n-\nLRV-Activated LRT Warning Sign--An alternative to\nthe flashing light signals is the use of an LRV-\nactivated, internally illuminated LRT warning sign\n(see Figure 35). The LRT legend should display a side\nview of an LRV since this view corresponds to the\naspect that is visible when the LRV is in the crossing.\nThis alternative device is particularly appropriate at\nisolated pedestrian crossings where there are neither\nother railroad-nor highway-type conventional active\ndevices present. It is also appropriate as a\nsupplemental device to standard pedestrian signals\nwhere pedestrians may exhibit risky behavior or\notherwise disobey the pedestrian signal indications. In\nthis case, the sign warns pedestrians of the increased\nrisk associated with violating the primary regulatory\ndevices (the pedestrian signals).\n-\nSecond Train Approaching Sign--At locations where\ntwo or more LRT tracks are present, and LRV\nheadways are short either because of service\nfrequencies or the presence of a \"meet point\" in the\noperating plan, use of a Second Train Approaching\nsign should be considered\nFigure 35. LRV-activated LRT warning sign.\n\n_____________________\nto warn pedestrians to look in the opposite direction\nfor a second LRV approaching the crossing. This\ndevice is under study in Los Angeles for pedestrians\nand, primarily, for motor vehicles at the Baltimore\nLRT system. The results of these demonstration\nprojects should be incorporated in the selection,\ndesign, and implementation of the Second Train\nApproaching sign.\nTable 4 summarizes the above recommendations for\nuse of active devices at pedestrian crossings.\nChannelization\nChannelization of pedestrians can be accomplished in\nways such as the following:\n-\nPaving--A feature such as a sidewalk or path provides\nan area for pedestrians to use and as such can be\nexpected to attract pedestrians and bikes.\n-\nDelineation--Through the use of changes in pavement\ntexture, materials, landscaping, or painted lines on a\npaved surface, the limits of the pedestrian pathway can\nbe indicated so that pedestrians will stay within the\nallocated walking zone.54\n-\nBarriers--A wide variety of barriers (e.g., fencing,\nrailing, chains with bollards, or wire strung between\nposts) can be used to provide positive control over\nmost pedestrian movements.\nThe pedestrian channelization treatments listed above\nprovide increasing levels of control over pedestrian\nmovements. The most restrictive is the barrier. Barrier\nchannelization can be used to control pedestrian access to\nthe LRT trackway, thereby focusing pedestrian movements\nat\na\ndesignated\nLRT\ncrossing\nlocation.\nBarrier\nchannelization also can be used to increase pedestrian\nawareness of the LRT crossing, as noted below:\n-\nControlled Access--A barrier can be provided that\nrestricts pedestrian movements to the preferred\npedestrian pathway and that forces pedestrians to cross\nthe LRT trackway at a designated crossing location.\n-\nZ-Crossing--A Z-crossing, as shown in Figure 31,\nforces pedestrians to make a 90-deg turn parallel to\nand facing oncoming LRVs immediately ahead of the\ntrackway. Thus, pedestrians are directed to look in the\ndirection from which an oncoming LRV could arrive.\nIn order to be effective, there must still be adequate\nsight distance so that LRV operators can observe\npedestrians prior to entering the trackway and so that\npedestrians can see oncoming LRVs.\nZ-crossings are ordinarily provided as a pair\nacross each of two tracks which are operated in\none direction\n54Delineation has limitations in inclement weather, especially snow\nso that pedestrians can be turned to face oncoming\nLRVs at each track. They are typically installed at\nmidblock locations (away from intersections). (See\nSection 7, Guideline 3 for a discussion of use.)\n-\nPedestrian Barrier--A pedestrian barrier (sometimes\nreferred to as a \"bedstead barrier\" due to its shape) as\nshown in Figure 31, acts in a manner similar to a Z-\ncrossing. However, the pedestrian barrier is a more\ncompact device which can be installed along a wide\nsidewalk. The same types of criteria which apply to Z-\ncrossings pertain to bedstead barriers. (See Section 7,\nGuideline 3 for a discussion of use.)\nPositive Control Devices\nPositive control devices provide a physical barrier\nbetween the LRT tracks and locations where pedestrians\ncan safely queue. These devices are the most restrictive that\ncan be installed at a pedestrian crossing. Surveys of LRT\npractices have identified two devices that are effective and\nin general use:\n-\nPedestrian Automatic Gate--A pedestrian automatic\ngate is configured and operates in much the same\nmanner as a vehicular gate. As shown in Figure 28, the\nautomatic gate is delineated with red and white\ndiagonal bars along its length and may include one\nsmall red light at the tip, which is illuminated when\nthe gate is activated. The pedestrian gate descends\nwhen activated, blocking the pedestrian path across\nthe tracks. (However, it is possible for pedestrians to\nwalk around the gate, in much the same manner in\nwhich vehicular gates are violated.)\nWhere children are present or at locations where\nthere is concern for pedestrians ducking under the gate\narm, skirts consisting of horizontal bars delineated\nwith the red and white diagonal marking used for the\nprimary gate arm can be suspended below the gate\narm on hangers (see Figure 28). This treatment should\nbe considered when an automatic gate is used in\nconjunction with barrier channelization to enhance\nclosure of the crossing during activation.\nBecause pedestrian paths are bi-directional,\npositive closure should be provided in both directions\nalong facilities such as sidewalks. When applied\nalongside a roadway, the vehicular gates in two of the\nquadrants can often be installed behind the sidewalk\nso that the sidewalk is protected by the vehicular gate\nas well. If automatic pedestrian gates are provided in\naddition, it may only be necessary to provide such\ngates in the remaining two quadrants. With gates both\nupstream and downstream from the crossing, it is\nnecessary to provide a clear zone to serve as a\npedestrian refuge between the automatic gate and the\nLRV dynamic envelope so that pedestrians in the\ncrossing are not trapped on the trackway when the\ngates are\n\n________________________\nTABLE 4 Use of warning devices at pedestrian crossings\na Alternative visual device is a Second Train Approaching sign for two or more tracks.\nb The LRV-activated LRT warning sign (the W10-ZZa sign as depicted in Figure 35) is an alternate to using red\nflashing light signals at LRT-only crossings. At crossings with both LRT and railroad, the W10-ZZa sign may be\ninstalled as a supplement to red flashing light signals and illuminated when LRVs approach\nc The LRV-activated LRT warning sign (W10-ZZa) may be used to supplement standard pedestrian signals to warn\npedestrians of the increased risk associated with violating the primary regulatory device (the pedestrian signals).\nd \"Chirp-chirp\" or \"coo-coo\" sound provided during WALK indication.\nactivated.55 (See Section 7, Guideline 1 for a\ndiscussion of application.)\n-\nSwing Gate--A manual swing gate is a gravity-\noperated gate that must be pulled toward an\napproaching pedestrian in order for the pedestrian to\nenter the trackway area. Manual swing gates, which\nrequire a positive action by a pedestrian to enter the\ncrossing, have been effective at forcing awareness of\nthe trackway and the possible presence of an\napproaching LRT. When used in conjunction with\nactive visual and audio warning devices such as\nflashing light signals and bells or the LRV-activated\nLRT warning sign, manual swing gates can be\nconsidered functionally equivalent to automatic\npedestrian gates. In fact, given that swing gates are\nusually installed in conjunction with a barrier\nchannelization device such as described above, the\noverall degree of control over pedestrian movements\nmay exceed that provided with pedestrian automatic\ngates, because pedestrians cannot avoid using the\nmanual swing gates.\n55The true LRV dynamic envelope (the clearance on either side of a moving\nLRV that precludes any contact from taking place as a result of any\ncondition of design wear, loading, or anticipated failure, such as air-spring\ndeflation or normal vehicle lateral motion) varies based on the type of LRV\nin use and whether it is traveling on tangent or curved track. For the\npurposes of this research project, the LRV dynamic envelope can be\nconsidered to extend on both sides of the LRT track, 2.13 m (7 ft) from the\ntrack centerline, for a total envelope size of 4.26 m (14 ft). This 4 26 m (14\nft) dynamic envelope would generally encompass most manufacturers and\nmodels of LRVs currently in use. Because automatic gates are generally\ninstalled 3.7 m (12 ft) from the LRT tracks, this leaves about 1.57 m (5 ft)\nbetween the automatic gate arm and the LRV dynamic envelope (as defined\nabove). This area between the pedestrian automatic gate arm and the LRV\ndynamic envelope should be considered as a safe pedestrian refuge area in\ncase a pedestrian becomes trapped within the trackway between lowered\npedestrian automatic gates.\nUnlike manually operated swing gates, automatic\nswing gates do not require a positive action by a\npedestrian to enter the crossing. The gate is normally\nheld open (under power) exposing a walkway across\nthe tracks as in Figure 30. When activated by an LRV\napproaching the grade crossing, the gate closes and\nexposes the emergency exit. After the LRV passes, the\ngate opens, once again exposing the walkway\npermitting access across the tracks and at the same\ntime closing off the emergency exit. Under power\nfailure conditions, the swing gate will automatically\nclose under spring tension.\nTable 5 summarizes the recommended use of positive\ncontrol devices, where such devices are required.\n8.3 Recommended Practice\nFigure 36 presents a pedestrian control decision tree.\nThe decision tree defines the types of pedestrian devices\nand control that are desirable on the basis of three criteria\nrelative to the pedestrian crossing environment. The three\ncriteria follow.\nTABLE 5 Use of positive control devices at pedestrian\ncrossings\nLocation\nTypical Device\nUnchannelized\nPedestrian automatic Gate\nChannelized\nSwing Gate with Active Visual\nand Audio Warning Devices\n\nFigure 36. Pedestrian controls decision tree.\n\n____________________\n____________________\nDecision Point 1--Criteria for Determining if Active\nPedestrian Control is Required\n-\nActive pedestrian control (i.e., an LRV-activated\ndevice) is necessary where pedestrian facilities have\nbeen installed. Pedestrian facilities include sidewalks,\ncrosswalks, pedestrian- or bicycle-only paths/trails,\nstation access routes, etc. Where these facilities have\nbeen provided, it is assumed that some minimal level\nof pedestrian activity is present, and, thus, active\npedestrian control is required.\nDecision Point 2--Criteria for Determining if Positive\nControl is Required\n-\nPositive control is required if sight distance is\ninadequate. Under ideal circumstances, there is\nadequate sight distance both for the LRT operator as\nwell as the pedestrian. For the purpose of this\nassessment, adequate sight distance for the LRT\noperator means that there is enough advance visibility\nof the crossing area such that pedestrian presence can\nbe identified and an estimate can be made by the\noperator of the need to slow or bring to a halt the LRV\nprior to entering the crossing. Similarly, adequate\nsight distance for the pedestrian means that the\npedestrian can observe an approaching LRV, and\nmake an estimate of the closing speed and time\navailable prior to the LRV arrival at the crossing to\ndetermine whether it is safe to cross the trackway56.\n-\nFor the purpose of Decision Point 2, positive control is\nlogically required if, through analysis of sight\ndistance, it can be determined that neither party has\nadequate sight distance and that therefore pedestrian\naccess to the crossing should be blocked or impeded.\nFor the more frequent condition in which the\npedestrian has sight distance but the LRV operator\ndoes not, a positive control device should be\nconsidered.\n-\nIn either case, there may be feasible actions that would\nincrease sight distance, either by widening the clear\narea on either side of the track or by moving objects\nsuch as signal cabinets, communication rooms, and\npassenger ticket vending machines, which diminish\nvisibility of portions of the crossing. Such actions\nshould be considered in conjunction with the decision\nto provide positive control.\n-\nEven if sight distance is adequate, positive control\nmay be advisable if circumstances exist in which\npedestrian\n56Under less ideal circumstances, it may not be possible for the LRV\noperator to see an approaching pedestrian but the pedestrian may still be able\nto see the LRT and avoid a collision. (LRV operators report that pedestrians\nare observed to \"dart out without warning\" in front of oncoming LRVs:\nPresumably in many of these circumstances, even though the LRV operator\nwas not able to predict the pedestrian behavior, the pedestrian had adequate\nsight distance to determine a crossing could be executed prior to LRV arrival\n) Scenarios which occur in accident reports often involve a higher speed,\nunaware pedestrian such as a jogger wearing headphones.\njudgment is potentially compromised. For example,\ncrossings near special generators such as sports\nfacilities, where crowds may encourage incursion onto\nthe crossing or near schools where children are less\ncapable of judging risk are involved may warrant\npositive control regardless of sight distance.\nDecision Point 3--Criteria for Determining if Barrier\nChannelization is Required\n-\nHigh activity levels in the vicinity of the crossing or\ndispersed pedestrian activity may require barrier\nchannelization to reinforce crossing safety, to focus\npedestrian movement at locations where warning and\nprotection devices are installed, and to enhance\ncompliance with installed devices.\n-\nFor the purpose of Decision Point 3, existing or future\n(i.e., predicted for the design year) high pedestrian\nactivity levels can be identified by assessment of the\nLevel of Service (LOS) of the crossing as defined in\nthe\nTransportation\nResearch\nBoard's\nHighway\nCapacity Manual, Chapter 1357. The LOS concept is\nused to evaluate congestion levels on the basis of the\nflow rate and available area for pedestrian queuing and\ncrossing movements. The resulting pedestrian density\nand flow rates are rated on a scale that ranges from\nLOS A (best condition) to LOS F (worst condition).\nThe LOS A to C range represents relatively\nuncongested conditions, the LOS D to E range\nrepresents moderate to high levels of congestion, and\nLOS F represents highly congested conditions.\nLocations which are predicted to operate in the LOS D\nto F range during peak periods are high activity level\nareas which would warrant barrier channelization.\nAs shown in Figure 36, there are five outcomes based\nupon the answers to the three criteria. In the least restrictive\ncondition with at least some minimal level of pedestrian\nactivity--a crossing with relatively low activity levels, good\nsight distance, and no other factors warranting special\nconsideration--the recommended practice is to provide\nactive warning devices at the crossing.\nFor the most restrictive condition--a crossing which\nhas inadequate sight distance and which is subject to high\npedestrian\nactivity\nlevels--active\nwarning\ndevices,\nchannelization, and positive control are recommended.\nEDUCATION AND ENFORCEMENT\nTECHNIQUES\nPublic education programs, staff training, and\nenforcement techniques vary widely from LRT agency to\nLRT\n57Highway Capacity Manual (Special Report 209) Transportation Research\nBoard, National Research Council, Washington, D.C. (1994) p. 13-1 - 13-29\n\n____________________\nagency. Although most agencies have comprehensive\npublic education programs, staff training and enforcement\nactivities are highly variable. There is little or no evaluation\nby agencies of the effectiveness of public education, either\nfrom the perspective of specific elements nor of the arena\nas a whole. By contrast, the Los Angeles LRT system\n(Metro Blue Line) mid-corridor photo enforcement effort\nhas resulted in a significant reduction in accidents and risky\nbehavior associated with the targeted violation (motorists\ndriving around closed automatic gates). This experience\nsuggests that agencies should evaluate various elements of\ntheir education and enforcement programs and should shift\nfunding toward the most effective aspects, as well as focus\nefforts toward identified accident types and target\npopulations.\n9.1 Public Education\nAlthough agencies are not required to present safety\ninstructions in exactly the same way, experience suggests\nthat safety information is best received when delivered\nclearly, deliberately, and simply: this is most important\nwhen attempting to reach children and adolescents. Some\nLRT systems have adapted techniques used in the\ncommercial world to reach out to children, such as the\nemployment of cartoon-like mascots to deliver safety\nmessages, \"rap\" songs used to convey safety messages, and\nMTV-like presentations of material. While these delivery\nmechanisms are not inherently problematic, LRT agencies\nmust use these techniques judiciously so as not to mask the\nintent of their safety messages. The messages are infinitely\nmore important than the medium in the case of LRT safety.\nConversely, materials do not have to be dull and\nmonotonous to deliver a serious message.\nSeveral critical elements are common to all good\nsafety training programs, regardless of the actual message\ndelivered, the training medium, the training locale, or the\nage of the audience. These are\n-\nClarity and simplicity of the central message,\n-\nHonesty and integrity in the delivery of the central\nmessage,\n-\nStatement and restatement of the central message, and\n-\nProgram evaluation.\nPublic\neducation\nmaterials,\nincluding\nhand-out\nliterature, video training tapes, and public service\nannouncements (PSAs), must be kept up to date, (i.e.,\nrevised every time a significant change such as the opening\nof a line extension occurs). Every significant change may\naffect a pool of people unfamiliar with LRT.\nHigh school driver education programs and private\ndriving schools are the perfect environment for introducing\nmodules on LRV/motor vehicle interaction. These driver\neducation modules are especially important in states that do\nnot yet include LRT or trolley sections in their public\ndriving manuals. Drivers' education classes that use driving\nsimulators in their curricula can include a segment on\ndriving in and around LRT crossings.\nPublic education materials do not necessarily have to\nbe aimed at the everyday users of the system. Depending\non the city, it may be desirable to develop new materials\nand strategies directed toward, for example, residents who\nare non-users of the LRT system, residents who are\noccasional users, or non-residents.\nTourists, business people, and other non-residents who\nvisit cities with LRT systems may not be familiar with\nexpected driving behavior along rights-of-ways or at LRT\ncrossings. Literature referencing the meaning of traffic\nsignals and proper motorist, bicyclist, and pedestrian\nbehavior can easily be distributed with the rental package at\ncar rental offices. Maps, routinely distributed at rental\noffices, might also be reprinted to highlight the local LRT\nsystem. Major airlines, especially those with destinations to\ncities with a tourist interest, may be amenable to placing\nPSAs in their in-flight repertoire or mentioning the LRT\nsystems in their in-flight literature.\nSimilarly, safety literature and PSAs could be\ndeveloped for use in hotels where tourists and business\npeople are most likely to stay or at convention centers\nwhere \"out-of-towners\"--who may be unfamiliar with LRT\n-are in full force. Brochures geared toward occasional users\nand/or drivers or pedestrians who may not be familiar with\nsharing street right-of-ways and the like could be regularly\nplaced in lobby literature stands and, at hotels, inserted in\nstandard in-room welcome packages. PSAs could also be\nbroadcast through a hotel's closed circuit television system.\nLocal movie theaters or cineplexes may be amenable\nto playing PSAs before the feature. As an example, the\nLong Island Rail Road, a New York commuter railroad\nwith 308 grade crossings, of which 298 are equipped with\nflashing light signals and automatic gates, has placed 30\nsec grade crossing safety PSAs at movie theaters located\nwithin the boundaries of its rail system.\nFinally, LRT agencies should work with their state's\nOperation Lifesaver, Inc. (OLI) coordinator to develop\ntraining and educational material specific to LRT crossing\nsafety. OLI is a national, continuing public education\nprogram designed to reduce the number of deaths and\ninjuries at highway-rail intersections and along rail rights-\nof-way (i.e., trespassing)58. For example, the Los Angeles\nCounty\nMetropolitan\nTransportation\nAuthority\n(LACMTA), operators of the Metro Blue Line LRT system,\nhave been working with California Operation Lifesaver to\ndevelop a training guide on LRT crossing safety. The OLI\nGuide for Light Rail (Adults and Children) was to be\ncompleted in the Summer of 1997. With this guide,\nLACMTA will be able to better train its employees and\nother interested parties to\n58To learn more about Operations Lifesaver, Inc. (OLI), including the name,\naddress, and phone number of your state's coordinator, consult their World\nWide Web page at http://www oli.org.\n\n____________________\npresent material on LRT crossing safety to both adults' and\nchildren's groups along the Metro Blue Line.\n9.2 Staff Training\nSystems should evaluate staff training options and\nshould develop a comprehensive approach that ensures that\nthis activity occurs on a planned basis rather than in an ad\nhoc fashion. This approach would entail identification of\ntarget audiences, content, and frequency of training. Of\nutmost\nimportance\nis\ninter-agency\ntraining\nand\ncoordination. Examples include joint training sessions and\nexercises with emergency responders such as police, fire,\nand ambulance services that would cover issues such as\ndriving emergency vehicles across LRT crossings when on\ncall and under routine conditions, responding to minor\nevents in the vicinity of transit property, and responding to\nmajor events in the vicinity of the transit property. Training\nand exercises with command and control staffs, such as 911\noperators and police and fire dispatchers is also critical so\nthat these staffs will know which procedures to follow if,\nfor example, a member of the public reports damaged or\ninoperative grade crossing warning devices.\nIn this vein, one way that LRT agencies can\naccomplish training and coordination is through a\ncomprehensive crisis management plan, such as the\nIntegrated Emergency Management System (IEMS). The\nIEMS, developed primarily by the Federal Emergency\nManagement Agency (FEMA), uses an \"all-hazards\"\napproach and an integrated operations plan to ensure\ncoordination and cooperation among different agencies and\njurisdictions involving all levels of government, volunteer\norganizations, and the private sector. A crisis management\nplan like IEMS consists of four phases of emergency or\ndisaster activity:\n-\nMitigation--Activities performed in advance to reduce\nor eliminate hazards;\n-\nPreparation--Activities performed in advance to\ndevelop response capabilities;\n-\nResponse--Activities performed after a crisis occurs to\nsave lives, protect property, and stabilize the situation;\nand\n-\nRecovery--Activities performed after a crisis has been\nstabilized to return all systems to normal.\nTo maximize coordination and communication during\na crisis, the LRT agency should invite outside emergency\norganizations (e.g., police departments, emergency medical\nservices, fire departments, public utility companies,\nhospitals, local government agencies, non-profit and\nvolunteer organizations, and private vendors) in its\noperating area to help develop clear policies, procedures,\nand formal agreements specifying jurisdictional boundaries,\nchains of command, and communications for the crisis\nmanagement plan.\nCrises that are likely to occur in the LRT system' s\noperating area should be determined and rehearsed.\nMethods of rehearsal include the following:\n-\nDrills involving transit employees during revenue\nservice,\n-\nFull-scale field exercises held at non-revenue locations\nor times involving all local emergency responders,\n-\nTable-top exercises involving the decision makers\nfrom the LRT agency and the local response\norganizations, and\n-\nComputer simulations of emergencies involving all\nlocal responders.\nAll exercises should be documented and, if possible,\nvideotaped for further study, and the findings should be\nincorporated in the response plans, procedures, and inter-\norganizational agreements.\nPeriodic drills of all LRT system emergency\nprocedures (preferably every quarter of the year) are\nneeded so that transit employees can understand the\nprocedures. Drills and field exercises also identify the need\nto revise procedures and to provide additional training for\nLRT agency personnel or all participants in emergency\nresponses. Regularly scheduled exercises allow testing of\nthe following:\n-\nEmergency plans,\n-\nNew procedures,\n-\nNotification procedures,\n-\nIncident command structure and overall coordination\nbetween response organizations, and\n-\nInteragency protocols and other agreements.\nFinally, for LRT systems that operate immediately\nadjacent to a railroad right-of-way or where railroad trains\nshare LRT tracks during non-revenue hours of operation,\nthe railroad employees must be included in all emergency\nplans. Further, all parties involved with crisis response in\ntransit agency property should be familiar with railroad\noperations and their likely response to the emergency\nsituation.\n9.3 Enforcement\nBecause the arrangements regarding enforcement vary\nsignificantly from LRT system to LRT system, it is difficult\nto recommend specific methods for enforcement. In some\ncases, enforcement relative to grade crossing safety may be\nout of the purview of the LRT agency. However,\nexperience suggests that this area may be the most critical\nin terms of actual accident reduction. The most successful\npractices are those that target particular accident types and\nlocations. In this vein, agencies should identify the biggest\nsafety concerns from accident data and observed risky\nbehavior and should work with enforcement staffs to\nconduct field campaigns designed to elevate compliance\nwith the rules of the road at LRT crossings59. According to\nthe Rail-Highway\n59California Operation Lifesaver (Tel: 916-367-3918) has developed a Law\nEnforcement Guide to (1) rail and transit violations (citing vehicle or penal\ncode sections), (2) grade crossing collision investigation, (3) stopping of\ntrains, and (4) emergency notification telephone numbers (including\n\n____________________\nFigure 37. Sample photo from photo enforcement program in Los Angeles.\nCrossing\nSafety\nAction\nPlan\nSupport\nProposals60,\n\"Experience has shown that visible, high-profile, law\nenforcement programs reduce the numbers of highway\ntraffic violations. Programs targeting traffic violators at\nhighway-rail crossings are also effective....\"\nThe LRT system with perhaps the most visible law\nenforcement program is the Metro Blue Line in Los\nAngeles, California. The LACMTA, operator of the Metro\nBlue Line, has a progressive enforcement program that\nincludes photo enforcement at 17 LRT crossings (on a\nrotating basis) where LRVs operate at speeds up to 90 km/h\n(55 mph)61.\nTheir photo enforcement system uses wide-angle, high-\nresolution cameras to photograph LRT crossing violators\n(e.g., those who drive around lowered automatic gates) and\nprovide one or more photographs of the vehicle, its license\nplate, and the motorist's face as the basis for issuing a\ncitation (see Figure 37). The camera system is triggered\nwhen a motor vehicle crosses over inductive loop detectors\n(buried in the asphalt within the LRT crossing) after the\nautomatic gates have started down or are already lowered.\nSuperimposed onto each violation photograph is the date,\ntime, and location of the violation, as well as the speed of\nthe violating\nLRT agencies and railroads) This pamphlet is intended to help LRT agencies\nand railroads in California educate local law enforcement about grade\ncrossing regulations so that they will be more inclined to enforce these laws.\n60Rail-Highway Crossing Safety Action Plan Support Proposals, U S\nDepartment of Transportation, Washington, D.C.

The elapsed time since the red flashing lights were\nactivated is also indicated on the photo.\nWhen a violating motor vehicle is detected, the\ncamera takes a photograph as described above. The film is\ndeveloped to see the license plate and image of the driver,\nand a California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV)\ncheck is run to determine the registered owner of the\nvehicle. A citation is printed in English and Spanish and is\nsent to the registered owner within 72 hr of the violation.\nWarning signs are installed near crossings with photo\nenforcement to inform motorists that such a system is being\nused. Warning signs display the legend PHOTO\nCITATIONS ISSUED (and in Spanish INFRACCIONES\nREGISTRADAS FOTOGRAFICAMENTE). Before these\nsigns were installed and photo enforcement implemented,\nthe average violation rate was two per hour on weekdays.\nAfter installation of the warning signs and mailing of\nwarning notices and citations (warning notices were mailed\nwhen photo enforcement was first established, about 3\nmonths later citations were issued), the violation rate\ndropped to one every 12 hr62.\nOn the basis of the experience at the 17 higher speed\nLRT crossings on the Metro Blue Line, other LRT agencies\nshould consider using photo enforcement at crossings\nwhere other measures cannot be implemented (e.g.,\nroadway medians on a narrow street) or where other\nmeasures are not reducing crossing violation rates. To\nimplement a photo enforcement program, the LRT agency\nmay need to work\n62Light Rail Transit Safety Issues, Los Angeles County Metropolitan\nTransportation Authority, Los Angeles (1994) pp. 7-8.\n\n____________________\nwith the state legislature to change or add laws to allow\ntraffic citations to be issued through the mail (with no law\nenforcement officer present)63. In most states, the current\nmotor vehicle code only allows moving violation citations\nto be issued by a sworn officer of the law. Thus, photo\nenforcement at grade crossings cannot typically be\nimplemented without a change to the motor vehicle code.\nFurther, once the laws have been changed to allow photo\nenforcement, the LRT agency may need to work with the\ncourts\n63Such programs may require state legislation to be upheld in a court of law\nIf state legislation has not been enacted, municipal courts may determine\nthat such programs are either legal or illegal In California, legislation\npermitting the use of photo enforcement at grade crossings (California\nVehicle Code 21362 5) and at red traffic signals (California Vehicle Code\n21455.5) has been enacted. There has been no such legislation for photo\nradar (to enforce speed limits). Therefore, the courts in California uphold\ncitations issued by photo enforcement equipment for grade crossing\nviolations and red traffic signal violations As far as photo radar is concerned\nin California, each municipality may determine the legality of such citations,\nbecause no statewide legislation has been enacted.\nto establish specific criteria for what is and is not\nconsidered a violation of the warning devices. Example\ncriteria could include the following: (1) a motor vehicle in\nthe crossing a certain amount of time after the flashing light\nsignals activate, (2) a motor vehicle in the crossing a\ncertain amount of time after the gates start to descend, or\n(3) a motor vehicle in the crossing with a certain angle of\nthe automatic gate arm (e.g., 20 deg from vertical). Most of\nthese criteria can be recorded directly onto the photo of the\nviolating vehicle."

Current systems, some of which are old and in\nneed of upgrading, must expand service area, increase service\nfrequency, and improve efficiency to serve these demands.\nResearch is necessary to solve operating problems, to adapt\nappropriate new technologies from other industries, and to\nintroduce innovations into the transit industry. The Transit\nCooperative Research Program (TCRP) serves as one of the\nprincipal means by which the transit industry can develop\ninnovative near-term solutions to meet demands placed on it.\nThe need for TCRP was originally identified in TRB Special\nReport 213--Research for Public Transit: New Directions,\npublished in 1987 and based on a study sponsored by the Federal\nTransit Administration (FTA). A report by the American Public\nTransit Association (APTA), Transportation 2000, also recognized\nthe need for local, problem-solving research. TCRP, modeled after\nthe longstanding and successful National Cooperative Highway\nResearch Program, undertakes research and other technical\nactivities in response to the needs of transit service providers. The\nscope of vice configuration, equipment, facilities, operations,\nhuman resources, maintenance, policy, and administrative\npractices.\nTCRP was established under FTA sponsorship in July 1992.\nProposed by the U.S. Department of Transportation, TCRP was\nauthorized as part of the Intermodal Surface Transportation\nEfficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA). On May 13, 1992, a\nmemorandum agreement outlining TCRP operating procedures was\nexecuted by the three cooperating organizations: FTA, the National\nAcademy of Sciences, acting through the Transportation Research\nBoard (TRB), and the Transit Development Corporation, Inc.\n(TDC), a nonprofit educational and research organization\nestablished by APTA. TDC is responsible for forming the\nindependent governing board, designated as the TCRP Oversight\nand Project Selection (TOPS) Committee.\nResearch problem statements for TCRP are solicited\nperiodically but may be submitted to TRB by anyone at anytime. It\nis the responsibility of the TOPS Committee to formulate the\nresearch program by identifying the highest priority projects. As\npart of the evaluation, the TOPS Committee defines funding levels\nand expected products.\nOnce selected, each project is assigned to an expert panel,\nappointed by the Transportation Research Board. The panels\nprepare project statements (requests for proposals), select\ncontractors, and provide technical guidance and counsel throughout\nthe life of the project. The process for developing research problem\nstatements and selecting research agencies has been used by TRB\nin managing cooperative research programs since 1962. As in other\nTRB activities, TCRP project panels serve voluntarily without\ncompensation.\nBecause research cannot have the desired impact if products\nfail to reach the intended audience, special emphasis is placed on\ndisseminating TCRP results to the intended end-users of the\nresearch: transit agencies, service providers, and suppliers. TRB\nprovides a series of research reports, syntheses of transit practice,\nand other supporting material developed by TCRP research. APTA\nwill arrange for workshops, training aids, field visits, and other\nactivities to ensure that results are implemented by urban and rural\ntransit industry practitioners.\nThe TCRP provides a forum where transit agencies can\ncooperatively address common operational problems.

This information has resulted from research and from the\nsuccessful application of solutions to problems by individuals or organizations.\nThere is a continuing need to provide a systematic means for compiling this\ninformation and making it available to the entire transit community in a usable\nformat. The Transit Cooperative Research Program includes a synthesis series\ndesigned to search for and synthesize useful knowledge from all available\nsources and to prepare documented reports on current practices in subject areas\nof concern to the transit industry.\nThis synthesis series reports on various practices, making specific\nrecommendations where appropriate but without the detailed directions usually\nfound in handbooks or design manuals. Nonetheless, these documents can serve\nsimilar purposes, for each is a compendium of the best knowledge available on\nthose measures found to be successful in resolving specific problems. The\nextent to which these reports are useful will be tempered by the user's\nknowledge and experience in the particular problem area.\nThis synthesis will be of interest to all transit professionals with involvement\nand interest in information technology (IT). It will also be of interest to those\nwho interact with transit agencies in this area. It is an update of TCRP Synthesis\n5: Management Information Systems, and documents the transit industry's state\nof the practice in information and communication technologies against a\ncontemporary background of business practice. It is organized into the basic\narchitectural pieces that constitute an IT plan in order to provide the essential\nframework for the planning process. Additionally, organizational issues and\npolicies and market trends affecting investment in and deployment of\nManagement Information System (MIS) technology are documented.\nAdministrators, practitioners, and researchers are continually faced with\nissues or problems on which there is much information, either in the form of\nreports or in terms of undocumented experience and practice. Unfortunately,\nthis information often is scattered or not readily available in the literature, and,\nas a consequence, in seeking solutions, full information on what has been\nlearned about an issue or problem is not assembled. Costly research findings\nmay go unused, valuable experience may be overlooked, and full consideration\nmay not be given to the available methods of solving or alleviating the issue or\nproblem. In an effort to correct this situation, the Transit Cooperative Research\nProgram (TCRP) Synthesis Project, carried out by the Transportation Research\nBoard as the research agency, has the objective of reporting on common transit\nissues and problems and synthesizing available information. The synthesis\nreports from this endeavor constitute a TCRP publication series in which\nvarious forms of relevant information are assembled into single, concise\ndocuments pertaining to a specific problem or closely related issues.\nThis document from the Transportation Research Board addresses the\nchanges that have occurred since 1994, emphasizes the critical management\nissues and problems confronting the transit industry, and provides concrete IT\nstrategies appropriate to various types and sizes of transit organizations. IT\nneeds are documented to be essentially the same for all agencies and, thus, the\nsynthesis focus facilitates a comprehensive review of the myriad IT issues and\nconcerns of the entire industry, accommodating both large and small agencies.\n\nTo develop this synthesis in a comprehensive manner and to ensure\ninclusion of significant knowledge, available information was assembled from\nnumerous sources, including a number of public transportation agencies. A\ntopic panel of experts in the subject area was established to guide the\nresearchers in organizing and evaluating the collected data, and to review the\nfinal synthesis report.\nThis synthesis is an immediately useful document that records practices that\nwere acceptable within the limitations of the knowledge available at the time of\nits preparation. As the processes of advancement continue, new knowledge can\nbe expected to be added to that now at hand.\n\nCONTENTS\nSUMMARY\n\nCHAPTER ONE\nINTRODUCTION\nPurpose of Project, 5\nOverview and Summary of TCRP Synthesis 5, 5\nOverview of Synthesis SG-8 Update, 7\nCHAPTER TWO\nMANAGEMENT ARCHITECTURE\nIntroduction, 9\nTechnology Investment Process, 9\nTechnology Advisory Committee, 10\nProcurement Process Coordination, 11\nIT Organizational Structure, 12\nIT Staffing Issues, 15\nNew Technology Evaluation, 16\nSecurity Administration, 17\nSurvey Findings of Management Architecture, 17\nConclusions, 17\nCHAPTER THREE\nAPPLICATION ARCHITECTURE\nIntroduction, 19\nComprehensive Business Process Reengineering, 19\nComponents of the Application Architecture, 22\nEnabling Technologies, 23\nCommon System Support, 25\nConclusions, 26\nCHAPTER FOUR\nTECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE\nIntroduction, 28\nStandards, 28\nComponents of the Technology Architecture, 29\nConclusions, 32\nCHAPTER FIVE\nITS/APTS ARCHITECTURE\nIntroduction, 33\nAdvanced Public Transportation Systems, 33\nIssues Affecting the Use of APTS, 34\nCost-Benefit Analysis of APTS, 35\nConclusions, 36\nCHAPTER SIX CONCLUSIONS\nACRONYMS\n\nGLOSSARY\nREFERENCES\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\nAPPENDIX A\nAPPENDIX B\nAPPENDIX C\nAPPENDIX D\nAPPENDIX E\nAPPENDIX F\nAPPENDIX G\nAPPENDIX H\nSURVEY QUESTIONNAIRE\nPARTICIPATING AGENCIES\nAPTA MIS/IT PEER GROUP SURVEY LETTER AND\nQUESTIONNAIRE\nTHE WORLD WIDE WEB: SPARKING A REVOLUTION\nIN TRANSPORTATION COMMUNICATION\nTECHNICAL OVERVIEW OF A LARGE TRANSIT\nAGENCY: THE PORT AUTHORITY OF NEW YORK\nAND NEW JERSEY\nSYSTEMS ARCHITECTURE INTERCONNECT\nDIAGRAM, USER SERVICES CHART, AND ITS WEB\nSITES\nTHE ANN ARBOR TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY\nADVANCED OPERATING PROJECT\nSTATUS OF NYC TRANSIT INTELLIGENT\nTRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS PROGRAM\n\nTCP COMMITTEE FOR PROJECT J-7\nCOOPERATIVE RESEARCH PROGRAMS STAFF\nROBERT J.

This update is designed to\nreassess the current condition of IT in the transit industry. The survey questionnaire that was\ndeveloped for this report uses the original 1994 survey questions updated to include new IT\nconsiderations that have emerged in the intervening period (see Appendix A). Fifty surveys\nwere distributed to transit agencies and there were 21 responses. Site visits were arranged\nwith three of the original seven transit agencies studied for Synthesis 5: King County\n(Washington) Department of Transportation/Metro Transit, Toronto Transit Commission\n(TTC), and New York City Transit. Phone interviews and discussions were conducted with\nanother 14 agencies, with particular emphasis on smaller and paratransit systems. These\nactivities were further complemented by IT plans from another 12 agencies and proceedings\nfrom industry-specific conferences [American Public Transit Association (APTA),\nIntelligent Transportation Society of America (ITS America)] and industry committees\n(APTA's Research and Technology Subcommittee on Integrated Technology and the\nNational Transit Institute's Committee on Advanced Technologies).\nThere are considerable difficulties in performing a synthesis project on IT in the transit\nindustry. IT is changing very rapidly and dramatically. The magnitude of change makes IT\nvery difficult to assess by any one researcher. Even the experts are finding it difficult to stay\nabreast of the changes, let alone trying to anticipate where this technology is going. It is also\ndifficult to address the issues of large and small agencies in the same report. Large agencies\nfrequently have extensive IT departments, sometimes numbering more than 100\nprofessionals, whereas small agencies sometimes have IT departments with only a few\nstaffers, sometimes none of whom are professionals.\nThe principal focus of this report will therefore be on large transit agencies, because an\nexamination of large agencies will facilitate a comprehensive review of the myriad IT issues\nand concerns of the whole industry. By addressing the more complex environments of large\nagencies, small agencies may have their requirements assessed as well. The organizational,\ntechnical, and applications areas of small agency IT environments are often a subset of the\nmore complex settings of large agencies.\nThis synthesis report articulates the current state of the practice of IT based on the survey\nresults and is presented in the context of the specific architectures that comprise an IT plan.\nBy using this planning structure it is believed that, in addition to presenting the report in a\nsystematic way, it will also provide the essential framework of the planning process itself,\nwhich is a central management tool for analyzing specific IT environments.\nThe following central architectural categories are used:\n\no\nManagement architecture--the primary organizational and managerial components of\na plan.\no\nApplication architecture--the software components, including all operating and\nbusiness systems.\no\nTechnical architecture--the principal computing platforms and communications\ninfrastructure supporting data connectivity.\no\nITS/APTS architecture--a subcomponent of the Intelligent Transportation System\n(ITS) National Architecture, Advanced Public Transportation Systems (APTS) have\nbegun to emerge as sophisticated real-time operations systems.\nThe approach that will be taken in each of the architectures will be to compare transit IT\nwith the prevailing approach of the broader IT industry with its current conditions and\nstandards using survey results, appropriate IT planning documents, and site visits/telephone\ninterviews and industry discussions.\nThe report begins with management architecture, the primary organizational and\nmanagerial component of a plan. This structural approach is consistent with IT planning\ndocuments from major transit agencies [e.g., Los Angeles County Metropolitan\nTransportation Authority (LACMTA), Orange County Transportation Authority, and\nWashington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA)]. This chapter explores the\ncurrent approach to IT departmental organizations with all of their specific functions and\nincludes a discussion of outsourcing, training, and the use of contracted services. In addition,\nthe central role of a technology investment process is discussed in the context of a\ncontemporary broad-based definition of IT, with its dependencies and the involvement of an\nenterprise-wide advisory committee for making investment and deployment decisions.\nSurvey results indicate that IT departments at many transit agencies remain organized\naround an older data processing or MIS model, without enterprise-wide responsibility\nconsistent with this broader definition of IT. Although there would appear to be more IT\nexecutives who directly report to their chief executive officers/general managers than in our\nearlier assessment, their organizational models are still limited to primarily supporting\nadministrative computing, with only limited technical support for operational systems. Only\na few agencies (e.g., WMATA, Port Authority of Allegheny County, and Port Authority of\nNew York and New Jersey) have moved toward the full chief technical officer model. A few\nmore are chief information officers (e.g., TTC, Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transportation\nAuthority) and most are still MIS managers [e.g., Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART),\nAlameda-Contra Costa Transit District] or below. Most have not put in place a full strategic\nprioritization process of a technology advisory committee or organization-wide investment\nand decision-making process. They are, more often than not, uninvolved in the critical\noperations technology investments and are only supporting very limited technical\nfunctionality.\nBased on the survey results, most transit agencies still do not invest in IT (percent of IT\noperational budget of total agency operational budget for the last fiscal year) at a rate\ncomparable to best practices in the public sector (above 3 percent), let alone the private\nsector (above 5 percent). Peer reviews of industry practices, including levels of investment,\nwere conducted by LACMTA in 1994 and 1995. This peer review included 12 peer agencies.\nNone of the respondents were above 3 percent; the highest level was 2.6 percent, with\nseveral below 1 percent and the majority between 1 and 2.5 percent. On the capital side, the\npercent of investment was far more significant, with several respondents above 9 percent.\nThere were no adequate numbers or percentages provided on IT training and maintenance\nbudgets. Except for the capital side this does not show much change from the last survey.\n\nSeveral surveyed agencies [including TTC, Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority,\nand Golden Empire Transit District (Bakersfield, Calif.)] use service bureaus, particularly for\npayroll and financial services and more than one-half outsource some IT functions or are\nconsidering such a move. This represents an increasing interest in and contracting out of IT\nfunctions.\nApplication architecture consists of a transit agency's basic software portfolio including\nall operating and business systems. Although many large transit agencies continue to use old\ncustomized software on mainframe and mid-range computing platforms, there would appear\nto be significant movement toward commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) standard software\npackages since the last assessment. There would appear to be even more movement in that\ndirection by mid-sized and small agencies. Consistent with that movement, many agencies\nhave been involved in or are pursuing business process reengineering/business process\nimprovement activities/engagements in an attempt to align their business practices with\nvendor-based software solutions. Although managing legacy systems and data (particularly\nin large agencies) remains a critical problem, and interfacing related applications is still a\nchallenge, the new open architecture, client server, personal computer (PC)-based technical\nenvironments facilitate the acquisition of new COTS packages whether they be \"best of\nbreed\" or single vendor.\nParticular attention is paid to exploring \"enabling technologies\" such as bar coding,\nelectronic forms, electronic signatures, imaging, video conferencing, and data warehousing.\nWith the tremendous growth in Internet/Intranet web-enabled systems and emerging\nelectronic commerce (E-commerce) solutions, particular attention is given to how these new\ntechnologies are being used.\nIn contrast to the 1994 survey, all but four of the agencies surveyed are developing or\nhave in place an active disaster recovery plan. Only a few are involved in telecommuting, but\nmost have a web site and use Internet/Intranet services. Although a few agencies restrict\nthese services to particular employees, some agencies make it available to all and are using\nthe Internet and web-enabled technology to post real-time system information in conjunction\nwith APTS technologies such as automated vehicle location (AVL) and kiosks. Some\nagencies (e.g., WMATA, BART, and King County Department of Transportation) are using\nE-commerce (the use of Internet services to conduct business) to post procurement\ninformation such as requests for proposals, but none are actively using E-commerce to\nacquire goods or services.\nThe three basic components of technical architecture are hardware, network capabilities,\nand data management. According to participating agencies, the movement toward open\narchitecture, client server, PC, local area network/wide area network-based systems has\ngrown dramatically since the 1994 survey. The adoption of technical standards that facilitate\nintegration and interconnectivity has also increased, but as suggested in the management\narchitecture, the IT departments at many transit agencies do not exercise the organizational-\nwide control sufficient to manage standardization.\nGeneral guidelines are discussed for data management in the context of open architecture,\nwith specific strategies for using legacy mainframe computers to house data warehousing\ncapabilities.\nAs a subset of the National ITS Architecture, APTS constitute the primary ITS\ntechnologies being instituted in transit systems in the United States. The complexity of\nAPTS highlights both the challenges and opportunities that confront IT in the transit\nindustry.\n\nTo be successful and accomplish the cost benefits possible under APTS, transit agencies\nface significant institutional barriers, such as governmental regulations, labor contractual\nconstraints, and political directives that make running the transit business very difficult.\nSecond, most transit agencies do not have sufficiently sophisticated contemporary and robust\ntechnical infrastructures to support the introduction and maintenance of APTS. Third,\nalthough industry standards and protocols are evolving, the industry is not yet close to an\nenvironment that easily facilitates the integration of individual APTS components. Finally,\naccording to participating agencies, the full value of APTS can only be realized if it operates\nin an integrated institutional setting with strong management support for instituting APTS'\n\"hard\" benefits.\n\nCHAPTER ONE\nINTRODUCTION\nPURPOSE OF PROJECT\nThe purpose of this synthesis project is to update Transit\nCooperative Research Program (TCRP) Synthesis Project,\nSG-5, Management Information Systems (1), and to\ndocument the transit industry state of the practice in\ninformation and communication technologies against a\ncontemporary background of business practice. In addition,\norganizational issues and policies (internal and external)\nand market trends affecting investment in and deployment\nof management information system (MIS) technology are\ndocumented. The audience for this TCRP project is transit\nprofessionals with involvement and interest in information\ntechnology (IT).\nThe TCRP Project SG-8 Topic Panel noted that the\napplication and level of sophistication of MISs used by\ntransit agencies in North America continues to vary widely.\nIn 1994, TCRP Synthesis 5 (1), identified the current\ndirection and key factors of successful MIS integration\nefforts applicable and transferable to the transit industry as\na whole. Today, a state-of-the-practice update is needed for\nthose concerned with improving transit information flow.\nThe SG-8 Topic Panel felt that information about market\ncapabilities could provide valuable insight to the transit\nindustry. How effectively data can be integrated into an\noverall information systems environment and used within\nand outside the transit agency might also prove useful. In\naddition, information about an organization's ability to\nmanage existing systems, deploy new technologies,\nand refine the organizational framework would be most\nuseful.\nOVERVIEW AND SUMMARY OF TCRP SYNTHESIS 5\nIn 1994, TCRP Synthesis 5 (1), identified the current\ndirection and key factors of successful MIS implementation\nat selected transit agencies. This report focused on the\ngeneral direction of change in IT and on specific integration\nefforts applicable and transferable to the transit industry as\na whole. Some background on the original study and a\nsummary of the findings are provided here.\nUnderstanding that the applications and sophistication of\nMISs used by transit agencies in North America vary\nwidely and that the transit industry lags behind the private\nsector with regard to the acquisition and deployment of\ninformation systems technology, it was possible to identify\nthe current direction of thinking and the key critical success\nfactors of those transit agencies involved in the best\npractices of the industry.\nSeven agencies were selected for visits based on their\nmeeting four fundamental criteria: (1) having developed or\nacquired sophisticated applications in at least one or more\nof four management and operational areas under\nconsideration; (2) having achieved some level of integration\nof their information systems; (3) having reasonable\ndocumentation of their activities with expansion plans; and\n(4) embodying information systems and technologies\napplicable to the transit industry as a whole.\nThe seven site visits were conducted over a several day\nperiod to determine the condition of their overall MIS\nenvironment but, more importantly, to assess the extent of\nintegration achieved in critical areas. These four areas\nconsisted of administration, planning and operations,\nmaterials management, and advanced technology systems.\nAn interview guide was created to help identify specific\nareas of integration that had recently been achieved using\nthe most current approaches and technologies and the\ncritical success factors most essential to developing and\nmaintaining effective and efficient management information\nsystems in the transit industry. The seven transit agencies\nand their specific integration projects were:\no\nBay Area Rapid Transit (BART): Capital Project\nManagement System\no\nMetropolitan Transportation Authority/New York\nCity Transit (MTA/NYCT): Integrated Maintenance\nManagement System\no\nSeattle Metro: Distribution Database, Geographical\nInformation System, and Operation Support System\no\nToronto Transit Commission (TTC): Automated\nTransit Operators System\no\nMetropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority\n(MARTA): The Maintenance Planning and Control\n(MPAC) Maintenance Management Information\nSystem\no\nMetro-Dade Transit Agency (MDTA): Transit\nOperations System\no\nMetropolitan Rail (Northeast Illinois) (Metra):\nInformation\nSystems\nfor\nRevenue\nTicket\nDistribution and Sales Status\n\nIn addition to the seven primary site visits, a question\nnaire was developed to acquire additional information from\na broader range of transit agencies. The 20 questionnaire\nresponses were further supplemented by 6 site visits to\nsmall urban bus and paratransit operations. Two of the\nquestionnaire responses [Oahu Transit Services (OTS) and\nOrange County Transportation Authority (OCTA)] were\nused in conjunction with supplemental planning documents\nto outline key issues facing MIS in transit.\nBarriers to Adoption of New Information Technology\nThere were several general barriers identified that apply to\nmost transit agencies:\no\nOrganizational barriers--In small transit agencies it\nis often difficult to access MIS staff and/or technical\nresources from the broader governmental entity. This\nusually means that the agency must rely on its\nlimited resources, identifying someone who is most\ninterested but not necessarily appropriately trained to\nprovide MIS direction and support. In larger transit\nagencies, the older data processing model of a\nmainframe\nenvironment\nprimarily\nsupporting\nfinancial systems has persisted. MIS organizations\nare\nfrequently\norganized\nunder\nthe\nfinance\ndepartment rather than under an administrative group\nthat has agency-wide responsibility and oversight.\nThis same kind of model has frequently led to the\nemergence of pockets of MIS resources outside of\nthe primary computing environment.\no\nPast practices--Perhaps the single biggest barrier to\nthe effective acquisition and deployment of MIS\nresources in transit is the condition of being wedded\nto past practices. The primary mechanism for moving\nto computerization has been to automate existing\nmanual processes. Although transit agencies are\nmore alike than different, a whole host of unique\nmanual processes have developed at individual\nagencies over time. This business approach in the\ntransit industry represents a major barrier to\nacquiring standard software packages to support\nprimary functions and makes transferability difficult\nacross transit agencies of similar size despite\nsignificant commonality.\no\nTraining--Lack of training in existing hard\nware/software\nand\nrelated\ntechnologies\nand\ninadequate education regarding new developments in\nMIS are critical barriers to success. Training needs to\noccur at two levels in transit agencies: training and\ndevelopment of MIS staff where they exist and\ntraining and education of user department personnel\nin appropriate technologies.\no\nFunding--Funding is a problem in two areas of\ntransit: a lack of funding to acquire, update, and\nmaintain critical management information systems\nand\nnew\ntechnologies\nand\nspecific\nfunding\nopportunities that create uneven or inappropriate\ninvestment in particular technologies. Because most\nIT is acquired through capital grant funding, which is\noften dictated by particular events and timing,\nprojects in this area do not always conform to\nstrategic need. It is not uncommon to see a\nsignificant investment in a particular \"exotic\"\nadvanced technology in an otherwise impoverished\nagency.\nUser Group Framework\nIn the transit industry there is a very large investment made\nin information systems and related technologies. Because\nthis large investment is made through federal, state, and\nlocal funds, there is a very pronounced need to create an\neffective, broad-based user group that can assist the\nindustry in making the appropriate investment in IT.\nBased on the size of the investment and commonality in\nthe industry, there is enormous value in creating a new\nframework to facilitate communication and assist decision\nmaking in the acquisition and deployment of information\nsystems technology. It seems appropriate to develop a\npublic framework to facilitate this investment process,\nwhich at a minimum can provide the following:\no\nUp-to-date information,\no\nSimple and objective description of information,\no\nStandardized evaluation methodology,\no\nAn easy and inexpensive method of accessing\ninformation,\no\nA single point of access in the industry, and\no\nAn automated as well as manual process for\nacquiring information.\nConclusions and Recommendations\nBased on the sample size, the amount of collected\ninformation, and the depth of the interview process, it was\ninappropriate for this study to try to describe the definitive\ncondition of the \"state-of-the-practice\" of MIS in the transit\nindustry in 1994. However, it was possible and valuable to\nidentify the current direction of thinking and key critical\nsuccess factors of managers involved in the best practices of\nthe industry. Most of this report concentrated on specific\nexamples of integration activities by leading agencies (the\nseven site visit's integration projects). It is believed that this\nfocus has identified the general direction of change in\ntransit\nMIS\nand\nspecific\nintegration\nefforts\nthat\n\nare applicable and transferable to the transit industry as a\nwhole.\nBased on a comprehensive review of the MIS functions\nand environments of the surveyed transit agencies and\ndiscussions during the site visits with key staff involved in\nMIS project activities, 18 critical success factors were\nidentified and prioritized as follows:\no Support key strategic business purposes of the transit\nagency\no Establish appropriate organizational structure for\nMIS\no Institute agency-wide planning process\no Employ systems development methodology\no Decentralize access to management tools\no Centralize control over MIS function\no Use automation to facilitate future expansion\no Initiate automation/reengineering process\no Perform cost-benefit analysis\no Move toward software packages rather than custom\ndevelopment\no Avoid prototype solutions\no Use computer-aided system engineering (CASE)\no Migrate toward open architecture\no Migrate to client/server architecture\no Maximize integrated solutions\no Facilitate use of data as resource\no Establish personal computer (PC) help desk\no Implement disaster recovery plan\nOVERVIEW OF SYNTHESIS SG-8 UPDATE\nSince the publication in 1994 of TCRP Synthesis 5 (1),\nmany things have changed and many things have stayed the\nsame. The technology itself has dramatically changed, and\ncontinues to change at an ever-accelerating pace. Even the\ntitle of the original report, Management Information\nSystems, has generally lost favor and has been replaced\nby \"Information Technology,\" which is reflected in the title\nof this synthesis update. PCs proliferate, replacing\nmainframe and mid-range computing platforms and are\nthemselves under the threat of the growing power,\nversatility, magnitude, and low cost of the Internet/Intranet\n\"solution.\" Lou Gerstner, Chairman and Chief Executive\nOfficer (CEO) of IBM, said in the New York Times on May\n12, 1999, \"The era of the P.C. is over.\" He went on to say\nthat although PCs will continue to be the principal\ncomputing platform, the future of the technology is moving\nto Internet/Intranet, web-enabled, and E-commerce systems\n(2).\nOn the applications side, we have the full emergence of\ncommercial off-the-shelf (COTS) products in the transit\nindustry replacing highly customized, individualized\napproaches to core business needs. Although it was\ndiscussed in 1994 as an emerging trend, we now have the\npractical maturity of open architecture, client server,\nWindows-based solutions that allow for much greater\nintegration and data sharing than ever before. On the\ncommunications front, we have more powerful, more\nrobust, and cheaper connectivity tools facilitating the data\nwarehousing/mining and web-enabled technologies to move\nand manage large, complex data flow.\nHowever, on the management side of the equation,\nmany things have stayed much the same. There remains the\nstrong management need to put in place an enterprisewide\nset of strategies and safeguards to appropriately invest and\ndeploy IT. There is a need to organize IT in the most\neffective and efficient manner; to employ, reward, retain,\nand train the best IT personnel possible in the public sector;\nand to continue to aggressively look for opportunities to\ncontract out for services better supplied from outside the\norganization.\nThis update is intended to address the changes that have\noccurred since 1994, emphasize the critical management\nissues and problems confronting the transit industry, and\nprovide concrete IT strategies appropriate to various types\nand sizes of transit organizations.\nThe survey questionnaire developed for this update uses\nthe original 1994 survey questions updated to include those\nnew IT considerations that have emerged in the intervening\nperiod (see Appendix A). Fundamental to this approach was\nthe desire to preserve the integrity of the original survey, to\nbe able to compare the responses and assess the change in\nthe condition of the industry. Fifty surveys were distributed\nto various transit agencies and 21 were returned.\nTwo-day site visits were conducted with three of the\noriginal seven transit agencies: King County (Washington)\nDepartment of Transportation (DOT)/Metro Transit, TTC,\nand NYCT. These visits included 2 days on site, interviews\nwith key IT professionals and senior management, \"walk\nthroughs\" of the IT environment and, in some cases, hands-\non demonstrations of major applications or technology\nsystems [e.g., King County's automatic vehicle location\n(AVL) program]. Phone interviews and discussions were\nconducted with another 14 agencies, with particular\nemphasis on smaller and paratransit systems.\nThese activities were further complemented by IT plans\nfrom another 12 transit agencies and proceedings from\nindustry-specific conferences [American Public Transit\nAssociation (APTA), Institute of Transportation Studies\nof America (ITS America)] and industry committees\n(APTA's Research and Technology Subcommittee on\nIntegrated Technology and the National Transit Institute's\nCommittee on Advanced Technologies). The Research and\n\nTechnology Subcommittee developed a comprehensive,\nweb-enabled (developed pro bono by Oracle Corporation),\nAPTA-sponsored IT survey (see Appendix C) as a\ncomplement to this TCRP Synthesis report and modeled\nafter this report's survey questionnaire. This new APTA\nsurvey will greatly expand the industry audience and will\nprovide an even more comprehensive assessment of the\ncurrent state of the practice. Altogether, 45 separate transit\nagencies were queried as part of this synthesis project.\nThe difficulties in performing such a synthesis project\nare considerable. IT is changing very rapidly. The\nmagnitude of this change makes it very difficult to assess\nby any one researcher, let alone a large team working across\nthe myriad areas of change. Even the experts are finding it\ndifficult to stay abreast of the changes, let alone trying to\nanticipate where this technology is going. Long range\nplanning in this area was once a 5-10 year horizon; that has\nnow sunk to 3-5 years and, more realistically, to 2-3 years.\nMany sophisticated planning studies and projections\nhave failed to understand either the dimension or type of\nchange.\nIt is also difficult to fully address the issues of large and\nsmall agencies in the same report. Large agencies\nfrequently have very large IT departments, often with more\nthan 100 professionals, whereas small agencies sometimes\nhave only a few individuals, sometimes none of whom are\nprofessionals. Large agency IT departments need to cope\nwith bureaucratic and often cumbersome organizational\nstructures; small ones usually work in a less structured,\nmore entrepreneurial environment. Large agencies have\ninherited older technology systems--mainframes and\nmidrange systems and expensive custom-built software that\ncan be difficult to maintain and/or integrate into new\nsystems. Small agencies often don't have to cope with the\nbaggage of older technology, particularly expensive\nmainframes/mid-range systems, and can acquire new\nsystems with far less difficulty. Both are, more often than\nnot, under-funded relative to percent of investment (the best\nagencies invest in IT operations at 3% of total operational\nexpense), lack the necessary talent in the highly competitive\nenvironment of IT, and are behind the technology curve\nwith regard to the most current methodological and\ndevelopment tools and the all-important area of on-going\ntraining.\nThe principal focus of this report will be on large\ntransit agencies facilitating a comprehensive review of the\nmyriad IT issues and concerns of the whole industry. It is\nbelieved that the focus on large agencies will accommodate\nsmall agencies as well, because general transit industry IT\nneeds are essentially the same for all agencies. By\naddressing the more complex environments of large\nagencies,\nsmall\nagencies\nshould\nalso\nhave\ntheir\nrequirements addressed.\nThe best approach to the structure of this report is to\norganize it into the basic architectural pieces that constitute\nan IT plan. In addition to laying out the report in a\nsystematic way, this will also provide an essential\nframework for transit agencies on the planning process\nitself, which is a principal management mechanism for\nanalyzing a specific IT environment and creating a\nblueprint for making IT investment and deployment\ndecisions. The central architectural categories are:\no\nManagement architecture--the primary organiza\ntional and managerial components of a plan.\no\nApplication architecture--the software components,\nincluding all operating and business systems.\no\nTechnical architecture--the principal computing\nplatforms and communications infrastructure sup\nporting data connectivity.\no\nITS/APTS architecture--a subcomponent of the ITS\nNational Architecture, APTSs have begun to emerge\nas sophisticated real-time operations systems.\nThe approach that will be taken in each of the\narchitecture chapters will be to compare transit IT (based on\nthe survey results, site visits, interviews, and research\nexperience) with the prevailing approach of the broader IT\nindustry with its current conditions and standards. Because\nof the small sample size, this report will be largely a\nqualitative discussion of IT issues. However, with APTA's\nnew web-based survey, quantification will begin to be\npossible later this year. This report is structured to facilitate\na comparison to the state of the practice on the part of each\ntransit agency (large and small) that reviews the content and\ncompares it's own condition to each of the architectural\npieces.\nFinally,\nalthough\neach\nof\nthe\narchitectures\nis\nindividually important to the industry, management\narchitecture is viewed as the most crucial in that it presents\norganizational and managerial strategies to facilitate the\ninvestment and deployment of the other architectures.\n\nCHAPTER TWO\nMANAGEMENT ARCHITECTURE\nINTRODUCTION\nManagement architecture is the organizational and\nmanagerial component of most IT plans and represents the\ncrucial IT investment and deployment strategies for transit\nagencies. Based on the survey results, site visits, and\nindustry IT plans (see Appendix B), in most transit agencies\nIT organization has been frequently overlooked and\nrelegated to only a supporting role. Rather than be involved\ndirectly in the prioritization and choice of IT tools and\nproducts, most industry IT departments only support limited\ndeployment. Management at most agencies does not foster a\nstrategic,\ncoordinated\ninvestment\nin\nIT.\nIndividual\ndepartments like operations, planning, and finance often\nchoose and secure their own information resources, only\nrequesting system modifications and support from their IT\ndepartments\nafter\nacquisition.\nThe\nresult\nof\nthis\nmanagement philosophy has been the evolution of an\nuneven,\ndisparate,\ninequitable\ninformation\nsystem\ninfrastructure without adherence to agency-wide standards\nor architectures. In large agencies, many IT organizations\nare a continuation of an oldfashioned data processing shop\nthat primarily supports the mainframe environment and its\nprograms, with very little attention paid to other platforms\nsuch as mid-range systems and PCs or the broader\ninformation needs of the whole enterprise. In both small\nand large agencies, this means that IT professionals are not\nsufficiently involved in the IT investment decisions.\nAccording to participating transit agencies, many\nindividual departments develop their own IT resources,\nincluding computer technology, software, programming\nexpertise, network and PC support, and maintenance. Those\ndepartments that have less direct need for automation, or\nhave small budgets, often go without developing even some\nof the most basic information resources necessary in today's\nbusiness\nenvironment,\nsuch\nas\nintegrated\nsystems,\nnetworking, and sophisticated electronic mail (e-mail)\nservices.\nThe resulting IT environment in transit consists of an IT\norganization that exercises control mainly over the\ncorporate (generally mainframe) systems and independent\ndepartments operating a wide variety of mainframe,\nmidsize, mini, and personal computers and application\nsoftware to support their individual and specific needs.\nDifferent departments performing the same functions often\nhave different hardware and/or application software to\nperform the same tasks. Even within the same department,\nthe technology and application software employed may\ndiffer by area or location. Some of these applications are\ndeveloped and supported by individuals in the departments\nwith\nsome\ntechnical\nknowledge\nand\ninterest.\nDocumentation for these \"home grown\" systems generally\ndoes not exist. Very little control is exercised in the\nacquisition of equipment, training, maintenance and support\nfor these \"departmental systems.\" IT assistance is\nfrequently only requested when problems arise or to\nperform system modifications, often only after vendor\nsupport is no longer available. Applications are frequently\ndeveloped for individual departments by consultants who\ndo not provide system documentation and use computer\nprogramming languages or technology different from that\nmore generally employed by the rest of the transit agency.\nSurvey and site visit results indicate that there is\ninsufficient coordination and control of the deployment of\nIT in most agencies. Duplication of information, lack of\nstandardization in IT equipment and application software,\nand insufficient control over the development of technology\nprojects\nresults\nin\nsignificant\ninefficiency\nand\nineffectiveness at transit organizations and inequities in\ntechnology investments between individual departments. To\nprovide appropriate centralized IT services and support,\nparticipating agencies suggest that it is necessary that an IT\norganization be created that can take the lead in developing\na unified deployment strategy for an agency's technology\nenvironment, and that all IT resources built by individual\ndepartments within the agency be absorbed into the IT\norganization. This approach to IT services suggests\nsignificant savings in clerical personnel, better use of\nmanagement time, and more efficient and effective\nutilization of the agency's resources.\nTECHNOLOGY INVESTMENT PROCESS\nSite visit participants and a review of IT plans indicate that\ntransit agencies cannot accomplish their IT strategic goals\nwithout the establishment of a technology investment\nprocess (TIP), the creation of a technology advisory\ncommittee (TAC), and the construction of an appropriate IT\ndepartment. These three activities are seen as essential and\ninterdependent actions.\nThe principal strategic IT goals that emerged from this\nstudy are organized in the following order of importance:\n\no Drive the management architecture for IT from\nbusiness goals and management objectives as\nindicated in an agency's strategic business plan. It is\nnecessary that an agency's business be managed in a\nway that protects and aggressively deploys the\ninvestment in IT. This strategy has been articulated in\nIT plans by the Massachusetts Bay Transportation\nAuthority (MBTA), OCTA, and the Port Authority of\nAllegheny County.\no Develop shared accountability for the IT investment\nbetween functional business areas and the IT\norganization. Interviews suggest that IT departments\nbe forward thinking, leading the agency into proper\ntechnology investments. However, without joint\nownership, responsibility, and accountability it would\nbe difficult for the transit agency to fully realize the\nbenefits of this technology investment. An approach\nused by agencies like The Port Authority of New\nYork and New Jersey and the Washington\nMetropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) is to\ncreate joint project management team leaders from\nboth the user department and the IT department to\nshare responsibility for individual technology projects.\no Rely on open architecture/COTS software to decrease\nthe need for in-house programming. Organizationally,\nthe IT departments in a number of leading agencies\nare moving toward the development of in-house\nadministrative and project management skills to\nmanage vendors and consultants and away from\nsystems development skills. This approach is being\ndemonstrated at TTC and King County DOT.\no Move IT to a \"facilitation\" philosophy. The IT\norganization facilitates technology for the whole\nagency and is organized to properly accomplish that\nobjective, as is demonstrated at The Port Authority of\nNew York and New Jersey.\no Establish a planning process to sustain an IT plan and\nrevise it as business demands change (see list of\ntransit agency IT plans in Appendix B).\no Deliver continued technology support while the IT\ninfrastructure is being changed over time. Policies\nand procedures are developed to help deliver\ntechnology and bolster IT. Using these procedures\nminimizes the risk of throwaway investments until\nthe technical and overall management skills are in\nplace within an agency to ensure responsibility and\naccountability for IT expenditures.\no Concentrate resources on \"agency critical\" systems\nand technologies. Agencies such as the Los Angeles\nCounty\nMetropolitan\nTransportation\nAuthority\n(LACMTA) are contracting out functions that can be\naccomplished\nmore\neffectively\nby\noutside\norganizations without compromising quality and\npotential technology growth.\no Improve the effectiveness of the agency's operations\nby taking a leadership role in business process\nengineering (BPR) and empowering agency staff with\nthe information required to make strategic decisions.\no Redefine IT processes, products, and services and\ndevelop an equitable pricing structure within the\ncontext of a partial to full cost recovery charge-back\nprogram. Identify the service and processing\nexpectations of IT's customers and negotiate a set of\nmutually agreeable and supportable service level\nagreements (SLAs). Charge-back programs and SLAs\nare in use at agencies such as King County and The\nPort Authority of New York and New Jersey.\no Reduce expenses and\nimprove\nefficiency\nby\noptimizing the agency's IT operations through the\nstrategic application of contracted services and\nimproved contract management [e.g., TTC and\nGolden Empire Transit District (Bakersfield, Calif.)].\no Leverage IT investments to generate new sources of\nrevenue for an agency. BART has developed\npublic/private agreements to recover revenue from\nthe commercial sale of the right-of-way for fiber\noptics and software.\nTECHNOLOGY ADVISORY COMMITTEE\nBased on organizational strategies implemented by several\nleading\nagencies\nincluded\nin\nthis\nstudy,\nthree\ninterdependent actions appear to be necessary to move an\nagency's IT organization into a position to fully support\nmanagement information, technology investment, and an\nagency's overall mission, goals, and objectives. These three\nactions are viewed as interrelated and complementary\ncomponents of the solution.\n1. Establish a TIP that reviews and approves the\nrecommendations of the TAC at the general manager\n(GM)/senior staff level.\n2. Establish a TAC composed of key staff from primary\nfunctional areas and chaired by the IT executive (or\ncomparable individual in smaller agencies) to\nrecommend which technology investment decisions\nare best for the entire agency. This committee would\noperate as the agency's single focal point for\ndeveloping recommendations for the acquisition and\ndeployment of IT and establish and oversee\nagencywide IT policies and standards.\n\n3. Create a robust IT department that can perform the\nday-to-day\nactivities\nof\ntechnology\nsupport,\nleadership, maintenance, and planning.\nThe TAC establishes the proper linkage between the\ntransit agency's management and the IT department. This\ncommittee represents key functional areas of the agency\nthat use and/or need technology tools, and will foster and\npromote agency-wide technology ideas and solutions. The\ncharter and responsibilities of this committee clearly\nestablishes it as distinct from, but operating in an advisory\ncapacity to, other committees/departments. Depending on\nthe strategic interests and IT needs of the agency, this\ncommittee has the authority to provide some or all of the\nfollowing functions:\no\nRecommend\na\nprocess\nand\na\ncost-benefit\nmethodology for the evaluation and prioritization of\nall IT projects at the agency.\no\nDevelop a list of all agency technology projects\nbased on all capital project submissions and review\nand evaluate all ongoing and proposed technology\nprojects on an annual basis, within this context.\no\nProvide the IT executive and agency management\nwith the information necessary to properly evaluate\ntechnology projects and investments.\no\nRecommend specific objectives and develop an SLA\nprocess for IT.\no\nLink to the organization's annual budget process.\nA specific TAC charter defines IT and delineates the\nminimum technologies over which the TAC, IT executive,\nand the IT organization have authority.\nIt is important that the TAC and therefore the whole\norganization adopt a definition of IT that is sufficiently\nbroad and consistent with evolving contemporary standards.\nThe definition of IT, used by agencies such as BART, the\nAlameda-Contra Costa Transit District (AC Transit), and\nOTS, includes all those technologies that are information-\nbased, generate data that have application across the\nenterprise, and/or involve standard computing platforms\nrunning on common communications infrastructures.\nMinimum technologies would include:\n1.\nAll mainframe/mid-range computer programs and\nsystems\no MISs\no Administration computing\no End-user computing\no Central control systems\nß\nDatabases\nß\nOperating systems\nß\nApplication software\n2.\nPCs and network hardware/software operating systems\no Applications/software/hardware\no Local area networks (LANs) and wide area\nnetworks (WANs)\no LAN server applications\n3.\nCommunications technology\no Telephones\no Telecommunications architecture\no Voice, data, and electronic image transmission\no Radio technology\n4.\nOther technologies including\no Bar coding\no Cash handling technology systems\no Command center technology\no Computer-assisted design (CAD)\no Geographical information systems (GIS) technology\no Global positioning systems technology\no Intelligent transportation systems (ITS)\no Materials management technical systems\no Revenue control and faregate technology\no Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA)\nsystems\no Security systems\no Signage systems technology\no Virtual reality systems\nThe overall intent of the TIP is to set policy, prioritize\nthe investment in information-related technologies, and help\nensure that technology investment is in the best longterm,\nstrategic interests of the entire organization. As part of the\nprocess of overseeing IT investment, the TAC has the initial\nand principal responsibility to develop recommendations\nthat would be reviewed and approved by the GM and senior\nmanagement. The primary functions of a TAC are to:\no Advise the IT executive on policy for MISs and the\nsupport technology. This would include helping\nestablish mission, goals, objectives, and IT standards\nfor the agency and the IT department.\no Establish cost-benefit methodology and standards for\nall IT investment.\no Prioritize, schedule, and monitor all IT projects.\no Assure the conformity of project development with\nthe program budgeting process.\no Arbitrate disputes between user departments and the\nIT organization.\nThe life cycle of the TIP, with its detailed phases, is shown\nin Figure 1.\nPROCUREMENT PROCESS COORDINATION\nAt a number of participating agencies, the procurement\nprocess is coordinated with the TIP and properly identifies\nand supports the central role the IT organization has in\nreviewing and approving all technology acquisitions.\n\nTechnology Investment Process\nFIGURE 1 Technology investment process life cycle.\nTo ensure that all technology requisitions are identified\nby an agency's procurement department and are reviewed\nby the IT organization for appropriateness, consistency, and\nadherence to the agency's standards and architectures, the\nfollowing approach has become the practice of agencies\nsuch as WMATA and The Port Authority of New York and\nNew Jersey.\no\nThe IT organization establishes a list of generic PC\nhardware and software standards appropriate for\ndifferent types of staff and usage (e.g., word\nprocessing, spreadsheets, CAD).\no\nProcurement and the IT department work together\nto establish vendor relationships and term contracts\nfor these items. A \"catalog\" is developed from\nwhich these hardware and software items can be\n\"purchased.\"\no\nIT-related requisitions for noncatalog items require\nIT department review and approval before they may\nbe purchased.\nIT ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE\nAt agencies that have executed an IT planning process, such\nas the Port Authority of Allegheny County, WMATA, and\nThe Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the IT\norganizational environment is organized under an IT\nexecutive who has responsibility for providing leadership\nfor agency-wide technology solutions. The definition of an\nIT executive has changed significantly over the past decade,\nfollowing from the changes in computing and its growing\nimportance in an organization. In large organizations, the\nMIS director has changed to chief information officer (CIO)\nand more recently to chief technology officer (CTO). The\nchange in title from CIO to CTO reflects the degree to\nwhich all technology, particularly ITS/APTS technology is\ninformation-based and requires clear oversight as part of the\nbroader IT environment. This change in title also reflects a\nchange in the organizational reporting of IT, from being\nsubsumed under finance, to being subsumed under\nadministration, to becoming a direct report to the CEO/GM.\nSeveral large agencies have made this title and\norganizational change in the last couple of years, but most\nagencies have stayed with an MIS director.\nMany transit agency IT departments are still organized\naround an older data processing or MIS model without\nenterprise-wide responsibility consistent with a broader\ndefinition of IT. Although there would appear to be more IT\nexecutives who report directly to their CEOs/GMs than in\nthe 1994 assessment, their organizational model is still\nlimited to supporting primarily administrative computing\n\nwith only limited technical support for operational systems.\nOnly a few agencies (e.g., WMATA, Port Authority of\nAllegheny County, and Port Authority of New York and\nNew Jersey) have moved toward the full CTO model. A\nfew more are CIOs (e.g., TTC, MARTA) and most are still\nMIS managers (e.g., BART, AC Transit) or below. Most\nhave not put in place the full strategic prioritization process\nof a TAC or organization-wide investment and decision-\nmaking process. They are more often than not uninvolved\nin the critical operations technology investments and are\nonly supporting very limited technical functionality.\nThe responsibilities of an IT executive in a large agency\nnow includes the following comprehensive list of functional\nareas:\noperations,\ndata\nanalysis\nsupport,\ncustomer\ninformation center, connectivity and PC support, project\nmanagement, and quality assurance. A recent organizational\nchart for WMATA is shown in Figure 2.\nIT Operations\nIT operations consist of:\no\nMainframe operations--primary responsibility for\nmonitoring and management of all hardware and\noperating/control software.\no\nServer operations--primary responsibility for the\noperation and management of all server hardware,\nserver operating systems, and server monitoring and\ncontrol software on all platforms.\no\nCommunications operations--responsibility for all\ncommunications hardware and for all network\nservers on all platforms.\no\nNetwork operations--primary responsibility for all\nnetwork operations, as well as LAN and WAN\nmanagement and planning.\nIn addition, IT operations usually prepares, manages, and\nmaintains the agency's disaster preparedness and business\nprocess recovery programs. Operations also monitor and\nmanage mainframe, service capacity, and network traffic.\nIT operations has responsibility for timely backup for all\nmainframes and server data files.\nFIGURE 2 WMATA organization chart.\n\nData Analysis Support\nData analysis support has responsibility for the acquisition\nand maintenance of an agency's data warehouse. In support\nof this warehouse, data analysis support provides data\nadministration assistance for the agency, including the\ndevelopment and maintenance of a data directory. Data\nanalysis support also acquires, maintains, and supports\nappropriate software packages for executive information\nsupport, management decision support, and general\nmanagement information support.\nData\nanalysis\nsupport\nalso\nsupports\nend-user\ncomputing, analysis, and reporting against the contents of\nthe data warehouse. Data analysis support has primary\nresponsibility for providing support for data acquisition,\nmanipulation, filtering, and scrubbing of agency data for the\ndata warehouse.\nCustomer Information Center\nThe customer information center provides all agency\npersonnel with Help Desk support and software user\nassistance. The customer information center maintains the\ncall log, tracks all incidents of software or hardware\nmalfunction, and routes trouble calls to appropriate support\npersonnel.\nThe customer information center is responsible for\nproviding the user departments with short duration\ndevelopment assistance, including advanced help with\noffice\nautomation\ntools,\ncreating\nuser\nworkstation\ndatabases, user spreadsheets, and specialized user reports.\nCustomer information center personnel provide on-site user\nassistance and other short-term support.\nConnectivity and PC Support\nConnectivity and PC support is responsible for all user\nworkstation support and for ensuring user connectivity to an\nagency LAN, WAN, and Internet communication facilities.\nIT personnel in this area assist users with PC hardware and\nPC peripheral problems, including hardware and software\ninstallation\nand\nscheduled\nhardware\nmovement.\nConnectivity and PC support manage the agency's\nworkstation and workstation peripheral equipment budgets\nand approves requests for all new hardware and software.\nConnectivity and PC support develop and maintain an\naccurate, agency-wide inventory of all PC hardware and\nperipherals and ensures that said hardware is appropriately\nand\npermanently\nidentified\nas\nagency\nproperty.\nConnectivity and PC support ensure that all software\nresiding on all agency workstations is properly registered\nand licensed.\nOperations, data analysis, customer information center,\nand connectivity and PC support groups provide support in\naccordance with negotiated SLAs between the IT\ndepartment and its customers.\nProject Management\nProject management is responsible for developing project\nplans and budgets and matrix managing projects in\naccordance with those plans and budgets. They provide\nreports to management on the status of progress against\nboth plan and budget. Project management provides liaison\nbetween the agency and its technology vendors and\nconsultants. This organizational component is the critical\nlink between the IT department and the whole user\ncommunity, and it is their responsibility to assure maximum\ncoordination with all outside resources for the successful\ninstallation of all new technologies.\nQuality Assurance\nQuality assurance is responsible for all test-plan generation,\ntest-case generation, and for testing all new agency\nhardware, software, and technology acquisitions. Quality\nassurance provides change management services for both\nhardware and software and coordinates all changes between\nthe department and the user community. Quality assurance\nprovides configuration management support for tracking all\nhardware and software. Quality assurance maintains records\nof all registered owners of all software as well as records of\nall installation and registration codes. Quality assurance\nmanages all documentation and ensures that there is current\ndocumentation on all hardware and software.\nIT Administration\nIT administration is responsible for the development and\nmanagement of the IT budget, and for providing\nmanagement with reports against the approved budget. IT\nadministration is responsible for vendor management,\nincluding assuring that all vendors used by the agency are\nfully\nqualified\nand\nfinancially\nresponsible.\nIT\nadministration\nis\nalso\nresponsible\nfor\nITS/APTS\ntechnology, planning, and architecture. IT administration\ndevelops and maintains department security policies and\nfacilities.\nIT Employee Administration\nIT employee administration is responsible for the devel\nopment and maintenance of current job descriptions for all\n\nIT positions and for all levels within each position.\nEmployee administration develops and maintains a current\nskill inventory, training plan, and career path for each IT\nemployee. Employee administration ensures that all IT\nemployees receive regular written performance reviews and\nis responsible for IT salary planning.\nIT STAFFING ISSUES\nIn agencies that have completed and deployed the staffing\ncomponents of IT plans, such as The Port Authority of New\nYork and New Jersey, IT organization personnel are trained\nin the latest technology and with specific emphasis on\nclient/server environments. IT has a vision of the uses of\ntechnology to support a leaner organization and improve\ntechnology use to achieve cost-effective business solutions\nand the ability to communicate that knowledge to users.\nThese characteristics are essential for effectively generating\nthe leadership and knowledge necessary to champion\norganizationally appropriate IT efforts and to coordinate IT\nbetween the other departments and regional transportation\nsolutions. The proper application of IT within a transit\nagency increases the effectiveness of the organization,\nenabling the agency to potentially do more with less.\nThe following sections detail some specific IT staffing\nissues being addressed by current industry practices that have\nbeen articulated by survey respondents and interviewees.\nTraining\nIf transit agencies, like all public agencies, are to do more\nwith less, training and training programs are critical to\nproviding excellent IT services. If automation is one of the\nkey mechanisms for improved efficiency and effectiveness\nthroughout the agency, then a significant investment in IT\npersonnel would help drive that process forward.\nInvestment in training will more than compensate the\nagency for the savings that can be made in a coordinated,\nintelligent deployment of new IT. Survey results indicate\nthat training occurs at two levels: (1) training and\ndevelopment of the IT staff and (2) training of other agency\npersonnel in appropriate technologies.\nIt is essential to provide adequate training and devel\nopment to IT staff in an environment that changes as dy\nnamically as IT systems. New technologies, new software\nsystems, and methodological enhancements are occurring at\na very rapid rate in the IT arena. For the IT department staff\nto take advantage of these technological changes on behalf\nof the agency, they require access to the most current\ninformation and techniques at the best agencies. IT staff are\ntrained in the businesses they are being asked to support. IT\nstaff are held individually responsible for developing the\nskill sets that the agency will require in the future and be\nproactive in pursuing training opportunities consistent with\ntheir career goals and agency needs.\nIn the case of training for other agency personnel, PC\ntraining, including the agency's recommended standard\nsoftware packages, advanced use of productivity tools, and\nLAN technology, is fundamental to facilitating a more\neffective and efficient work force.\nIT plays a centralized role in defining the needs and\nspecifications for technology-related training; however, the\nIT department will not attempt to take on the role of\nbecoming the trainer, because that role already exists more\nappropriately elsewhere within most agencies (e.g.,\nWMATA). Because of the number of agency employees\nthat will be trained, types of training that are needed, and\nthe time frames within which the training will take place, a\nsignificant amount of the initial training can be\naccomplished through contracted services.\nIn addition, training is provided to the user community\nwhen new application systems are implemented and before\nthey are placed into production, so that they are used\nproperly to maximize information and return on investment\n(e.g., The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey).\nUpgrading of the Existing IT Staff\nImproved staffing is required to bolster the IT infrastructure\nand deliver the functionality demanded by the user\ncommunity. Strong training of existing talent and selective\nupgrading of the staff to meet functional requirements can\nimprove the quality of the IT staff. IT departments at\nagencies like OCTA have developed a comprehensive\nstaffing plan that helps identify functional deficiencies, pay\ninequities, and skill gaps, and facilitates a long-term\nstrategy for improving staffing quality.\nTechnology workers often look for challenges, growth,\nand career opportunities. Plans for professional growth and\ndiversity need to be developed or IT will simply act as the\ntraining ground for other companies. IT staff at leading\nagencies are provided with the opportunity to diversify their\nskill sets by training and exposure to new technologies. All\nIT employees should have a defined career path and a\ntraining program tailored to help them achieve those career\ngoals. In addition, each IT manager develops a succession\nplan to ensure that new management personnel are always\nbeing trained and waiting to replace those that are promoted\nor leave the agency.\nUse of Contracted Services\nIT outsourcing is a controversial issue in the transit industry,\nwhere such departments are primarily unionized; however,\ncontracting out and/or outsourcing for IT services is\n\nincreasingly common in transportation and other public\nagencies and in private industry. A 1995 Gartner Group\nsurvey (3) indicated that approximately 69 percent of\nrespondents had implemented some form of IT outsourcing,\nand that 78 percent were considering it as part of their\nfuture plans. Contracted services are considered to be a way\nto save both money and time and a method for filling short-\nterm needs for skills in new technologies. In most cases, it\nis easier and more cost effective to acquire these skills by\nmeans of contracted services than through staff training or\nthe hiring of new personnel. The downside to this approach\nis the negative effect contracting out certain traditional IT\nfunctions may have on the morale of the remaining\nemployees. Nevertheless, the benefits often far outweigh\nthe disadvantages.\nBusiness goals, priorities, and timing drive the\ncontracting-for-service\nprocess.\nContracting-for-service\ndecisions can then be made based on the importance of\nparticular functions to the agency and the availability of\ninhouse skills. Some IT functions are particularly well\nsuited to this concept. These include application support,\nstandards development, PC/hardware maintenance, request\nfor\nproposal\n(RFP)\nmanagement,\njob\ndescription\ndevelopment, skills inventory development, training plan\ndevelopment, and training. Contractors can also be\nbeneficial in providing certain functional or application\nneeds, such as scanning, record management, and selective\nprogramming. These too would be considered as possible\nareas of opportunity.\nThe focus of the IT department at an agency, as at other\npublic and private organizations, is changing to reflect the\nnew realities of technology support. Although certain\nfunctions can be accomplished through contracted services,\nothers have to remain in-house. Skills to support these\nfunctions can be developed by IT staff or acquired by hiring\nnew personnel with the requisite training and experience.\nThe Gartner Group has identified a number of such core\nfunctions that are consistent with our recommendations for\nthe transit IT department. These functions include: (1)\narchitecture, (2) strategic planning, (3) governance\noversight, and (4) process management.\nThese are functions critical to an agency's success and\nreflect the business goals of the agency. According to the\nGartner Group, these functions should not be left entirely in\nthe hands of outside organizations. Architectures to support\nan agency in the use of IT are constantly developed,\npublished, circulated, reviewed, and enforced. Planning for\nchanges in technology and business is continuously\nperformed. Governance oversight, the procedures necessary\nfor conducting business and establishing relationships\nbetween the IT department, individual departments, and\noutside vendors, is required for the purpose of providing\neffective services and adding value. Process management\nestablishes the procedures to be employed by agency staff\nand outside vendors and used for project management as\nwell.\nContracted Development\nThe IT organization is responsible for managing outside\nvendors and consulting resources. Managing vendor or\nconsultant-developed projects takes different administrative\nskills than managing in-house development. Before\nundertaking new projects, a comprehensive BPR effort,\nincluding enterprise level and business area analyses (ELA\nand BAA) that establish the business needs and direction of\nthe agency, is performed by the best agencies. These\nanalyses consider the needs of the agency and the region,\nthe available technology, the fit with the current business\nplans of individual departments, and the costs and benefits\nassociated with its implementation.\nInformation System Planning\nInformation system planning is the key component driving\nimplementation and maintenance of the long-range plan and\nkeeping the IT organization and the investment in IT ahead\nof the functional needs of the agency.\nTechnical planning and standards are established and\nmaintained for hardware, software, and communications\nplanning for the agency. These plans are short range,\nreflecting changes in the business, the transportation\nindustry, and the needs of the users, and ensuring that the\ntechnology is consistent with overall agency needs.\nCommunications planning is also a part of this strategy. All\ncommunication-related activity at the agency (voice, data,\nvideo, and radio) is not only integrated, but investment is\nproperly managed and planned.\nData Administration\nComputerized information at an agency is seen as a critical,\norganization-wide asset. Establishing this function within\nthe data analysis group is necessary to properly manage the\nagency's data resources. This area has two charges. First, a\ndata administration component focuses on the proper use\nand sharing of data warehouse information across business\nunits. The second component, a technical database\nadministration component, has a technical design and\nconsulting support role.\nNEW TECHNOLOGY EVALUATION\nIT is changing at a rapid pace. New technology, such as\ncomputer hardware, SCADA systems, operating systems,\n\nsoftware applications communication equipment, advanced\ntechnology, and ITS/APTS is seemingly introduced or\nupgraded almost daily. Use of the Internet internally and\nexternally to promote an agency's business is being\naggressively investigated by leading agencies, such as\nBART. The IT department keeps track of and evaluates new\ntechnology and determines what can effectively be\nimplemented at the agency to improve services, reduce\ncosts, or generate revenue.\nSECURITY ADMINISTRATION\nAs technology is rapidly deployed, the information on all\ncomputers is secured against accidental, unintentional,\nfraudulent,\nor\nunauthorized\nuse\nor\ndestruction.\nOrganizational responsibility for the management of\nsecurity for each individual system and proper access\ndetermination\nis\nestablished.\nOwnership\nand/or\nadministrative responsibility for all IT assets is assigned or\ndetermined. The final determination for access of\ninformation resides with the functional area data owners.\nHowever, the functional owners need to be judicious in the\nlimits they impose on access to data, especially for viewing\nand transferring to other applications and spreadsheets.\nSecurity administration has the responsibility to implement\nthe decisions made by each of these functional areas. This\nownership of data by the functional users is balanced by a\ngrowing need to view data as a corporate asset with no\nsingle user as its owner.\nDisaster recovery planning is imperative with the goal of\npermitting the agency to reconstitute critical IT systems in a\ntimely fashion with current data. Plans are kept current and\ndisaster recovery trial runs (without warning) are performed\nregularly. However, the proliferation and expected\nacquisition of new hardware platforms and software\napplication packages can further complicate this task. The\noperations area manages the disaster recovery/business\nresumption plan, but the development of the plan could be\naccomplished through a service contract.\nSURVEY FINDINGS OF MANAGEMENT ARCHITECTURE\nBased on the survey results, interviews, and IT planning\ndocuments it would appear that most transit agencies still\ndo not invest in IT (percent of IT operational budget of total\nagency operational budget for last fiscal year) at a rate\ncomparable to best practices in the public sector (above 3\npercent), let alone the private sector (above 5 percent).\nNone of the respondents were above 3 percent, with the\nhighest level at 2.6 percent and several below 1 percent,\nwith the majority between 1 and 2.5 percent. On the capital\nside the percent of investment was far more significant,\nwith several above 9 percent. There were no adequate\nnumbers or percentages provided on IT training and\nmaintenance budgets. Except for the capital side, this does\nnot show much change from the previous (1994) survey.\nSeveral agencies use service bureaus, particularly for\npayroll and financial services, and more than one-half\ncontract out some IT functions or are considering doing so.\nThis represents an increase in and an increasing interest in\noutsourcing.\nIn contrast to the previous survey results, almost all\nagencies have an active disaster recovery plan or are\ndeveloping one. Only a few are involved in telecommuting,\nbut most have a web site and use Internet/Intranet services.\nAlthough a few agencies restrict these services to\ndesignated employees, some agencies make it available to\nall and are using the Internet and web-enabled technology\nto post real-time system information in conjunction with\nITS/APTS technologies such as AVL and kiosks. Some\nagencies are using electronic commerce (E-commerce) to\npost procurement information like RFPs, but none are\nactively using E-commerce to acquire goods or services\n(see chapter 4).\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe migration away from custom-developed solutions and\ntoward off-the-shelf applications represents a significant\nchange in the way most agencies have acquired IT solutions\nand requires different skills for effective management. As\nmore standard COTS software applications are available\nand installed there is less need for programming skills and\nmore need for new technology and business-related skills.\nThese new skills--skills that are not currently widely\navailable in most transit agency's IT staffs--include\nnetworking, project definition and management, application\nsystem selection, and database administration. In particular,\nnetworking becomes a much more critical function in\nsupport of distributed client/server applications that depend\non a stable, well-defined, and configured network in order\nto function. The new role of the IT professional as an in\nhouse\nbusiness/technology\nconsultant\nrequires\nIT\nemployees to develop increased knowledge of the\nbusinesses of the agency and the systems and technology\nthat support them.\nAn effective IT department supports an agency by pro\nviding technological solutions to specific business prob\nlems. This includes bringing WAN support to all agency\nlocations and establishing connectivity between the LANs\nand WANs into the IT department. This is essential for\neffective management and decision making by providing\naccess to appropriate data from any agency location.\nEnterprise network standards are established and enforced\nby agencies with network plans. Public/private partnerships\n\nwith telecommunications companies interested in obtaining\nan agency's rights-of-way could be used to help pay for\nsome or all of these initiatives, as has been done at BART.\nBART developed the original public/private partnership for\nleasing their right-of-way for fiber optics.\nGreatly enhanced project/program management skills\nare critical to the success of IT application acquisition and\nimplementation. With the emergence of COTS, it is\ngenerally viewed that customization is to be avoided if at all\npossible. Where customization is necessary IT staff needs to\nbe involved in that effort as well, if only for definition and\ntesting. It is important that agency personnel become more\naccepting of solutions that can be obtained from COTS\nsoftware and more willing to compromise. This would also\nresult in quicker, more efficient, cost-effective solutions.\nSome transit agencies have developed an equitable\ncharge-back system for their services (e.g., TTC and\nWMATA). This approach requires determining the costs\nassociated with operating IT systems, developing a\nmethodology to allocate those costs fairly to the user\ncommunity, and communicating those charges to the users.\nUser personnel are involved in this effort. The charge-backs\nare usage-based and competitively priced. A menu of\nservices and associated costs are published, and the users\nare free to select from that menu those services desired. A\nTAC normally assumes the lead in developing the charge-\nback system. Methodologies for determining the total\nsystem\ncost,\nincluding\npurchase\nprice,\nhardware,\nmaintenance, and support would be developed as part of\nthis process.\nSystem integration and data sharing is always an\nimportant element in new system implementation. An\nagency data warehouse, such as that in King County\n(Washington), is established, where information is entered\ninto a system only once, at the source, and is automatically\nelectronically communicated with all other systems\nrequiring that data. Data are an important agency-wide\nresource, which are shared throughout the organization and\nmanaged efficiently.\nSystem\nease-of-use\nand\nsimilar\n\"look-and-feel\"\nincreases user comfort levels and makes training easier,\nwhich is especially important in an environment undergoing\nchange, reorganization, and employee movement. All new\nsystems, such as those at the Port Authority of Allegheny\nCounty, employ similar graphical user interfaces (GUIs),\n\"point and click,\" and on-line help that would facilitate this\ntechnology shift.\nIt is increasingly viewed that IT organizations should\nhave few, if any, traditional programming staff. In this\nscenario, the current programming staff would be trained to\nbecome proficient in the new technologies and management\nrequisites. Any additional programming that is required\ncould be acquired far more cost effectively from\ncontractors.\nSome common strategic goals that have been identified\nfor IT organizations, according to participating agencies, are:\no\nDevelop a commitment to the overall management\nphilosophy rather than the earlier data processing\nvision.\no\nCentralize control and acquisition of technology\nthrough appropriate policies and procedures.\no\nReduce programming to rapid development projects\nand data warehouse support using fourth generation\nlanguages and PC computer tools.\no\nUse\nstandard\nsoftware\npackages,\neliminating\ncustomization and in-house programming.\no\nMove IT toward greater managerial self-sufficiency\nwith contracted services for support and secondary\nfunctions.\no\nIntroduce a cost-benefit prioritization process for\ntechnology acquisition.\no\nIdentify data as a corporate resource that is planned,\nmanaged, and controlled in order to be used\neffectively by everyone.\no\nImprove relationships between the IT department\nand users by providing procedures and systems that\nare\nresponsive\nto\nuser\nrequirements\nand\ninstitutionalized in the SLAs.\n\nCHAPTER THREE\nAPPLICATION ARCHITECTURE\nINTRODUCTION\nThe application architecture documents the basic portfolio\nof business application systems required to support a transit\nagency's data requirements. It represents the basic software\nsystems used to support the essential business information\nneeds of an agency.\nThis architecture defines systems that are essential to\nproviding automated processing support for the data entities\nthat have been defined for an agency and for processing\nrequirements that lend themselves to automated application\nsystem support.\nFrom our survey, site visits, and IT planning documents,\nit would appear that the overall application portfolio of\nmost large agencies is old, difficult, and costly to support,\nnot user friendly and nonintegrated. There would appear to\nbe \"much data but little information.\" In addition to these\nagency-wide systems, various departments have developed\nor acquired applications of their own on many different\nplatforms, operating systems, and computer languages. The\ndepartments \"own\" the systems and much of the data that\nresides on them are not shared or sharable with the rest of\nthe organization.\nIn most large agencies, as evidenced in their IT plans\n[e.g., Chicago Transit Authority (CTA), MBTA, and AC\nTransit], financial and administrative applications consisted\npredominantly of customized software developed by in\nhouse IT staff and vendor-supplied application packages\ncustomized specifically for the agency. These systems have\ncontinued to be modified as needed to provide desired user\nsupport. The screens supporting these applications are\nusually character-based and have little, if any, customized\nhelp processing for user guidance, making these systems\nuser unfriendly compared with contemporary \"point and\nclick\" GUI systems. As a result, user training is also more\ndifficult. Various user departments in these same agencies\noften use different electronic mail systems as well.\nAt large transit agencies [e.g., Los Angeles County\nMetropolitan Transportation Authority (LACMTA), OCTA,\nand MARTA], individual departments have acquired or\ndeveloped applications of their own choosing, which run on\nvarious hardware platforms. The applications are generally\ncustomized, but vendors support some of these systems\ndirectly. Many of the systems took far longer than planned\nto design and implement, and have not fully met the needs\nof the user departments. Negotiations to resolve the\ndifferences between these agencies' needs, contract\nrequirements, and the vendor's products are frequently\nongoing or have been settled with compromise settlements\nand incomplete functionality. Many of the systems built for\nsingle departments do not integrate with other departments,\neven though the same people developed them at\napproximately the same time. Because the systems were\nacquired by the departments without the assistance of the IT\norganization, many of these applications often had limited\nsystem or user documentation, making support and training\ndifficult.\nPC applications also have been developed by individual\nusers and/or departments to support processes or produce\nreports that were not supported by the mainframe systems\nor as an adjunct to those systems. Many different PC\nsoftware packages were used to support the same type of\napplication\n(e.g.,\nLotus,\nQuattro\nPro,\nand\nExcel\nspreadsheets; Microsoft Word and WordPerfect word\nprocessors; and Microsoft Access databases).\nMany of the financial and administrative systems of\nthese same large transit agencies reside on mainframes, but\nfrequently there is a lack of integration between these\nsystems. This often results in the same data being entered\nmultiple times by different people and leads to data\ndivergence. Furthermore, the data in these systems are often\nnot what the business units desired, resulting in the\ndevelopment of department \"shadow systems,\" especially\nfor financial, project management, and human resources\ninformation. This process replicates data and often results in\ninconsistent information reported from different sources.\nThis problem is compounded by the various nonintegrated\ndepartment systems residing on multiple platforms. In most\nlarge agencies, only a minimal data warehouse exists, and\nreporting information from the data is difficult.\nCOMPREHENSIVE BUSINESS PROCESS\nREENGINEERING\nThe process of changing the manner in which business is\nconducted to improve efficiency and effectiveness in an\norganization and to take advantage of the new feature/\nfunctionality of COTS software is called BPR. To facilitate\nthe acquisition, implementation, and installation of new\n\napplications required by a transit agency, a comprehensive\nBPR is being required by some agencies, such as WMATA\nand The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.\nBased on the state of the current practice, as evidenced\nby industry IT planning documents (see Appendix B), the\nfollowing are the principal steps in the process of\nimplementing system changes:\no Complete IT project profiles\no BPR\nß ELA\nß BAA\nß Process documentation\no Prepare detailed specifications\no Issue RFP\no Evaluate vendor proposals\no Select vendor\no Complete test plan\no Test system\no Use new system\nComplete Project Profiles--Potential IT investment\nprojects are summarized on an IT project profile form,\nwhich includes estimates for the time frame for\nimplementing\nthe\nchange,\nexpected\nmanpower\nrequirements, and cost-benefit analysis.\nBPR--BPR is a vital prelude to the upgrade and\nreplacement of any existing software system. It makes no\nsense to computerize bad procedures. Most transit agencies\nhave a demonstrable need to improve the way business is\nconducted, because individual business practices often grow\nup over a long period of time without comprehensive,\nrational scrutiny.\nA fundamental assumption of COTS and the bringing of\nbusiness activities into alignment with these standard\npackages through BPR is that transit functions are basically\nalike (transit is an industry with a uniform set of process\ndefinitions called the National Transit Database), and those\nprocesses that are unique to a particular organization may\nactually represent poor business practices. In agencies using\nBPR, users are challenged to demonstrate the real need for\nunique processes, some of which may be required because\nof union contracts or local regulations. BPR is also\naccompanied by a rejustification of all existing processes\nand procedures.\nELA--The BPR process begins with an analysis of the\nagency as a whole. This analysis provides a framework\nwithin which the more detailed BAA can be conducted.\nThis analysis establishes the major functions of the\norganization and their interrelationships as well as the\nmajor data entities of the agency. The function of the\nmapping of the agency is performed independently of the\norganization management structure (a LACMTA enterprise\nand data model and an entity-relationship diagram are\nshown in Figures 3 and 4).\nBAA--Once the ELA is completed and validated, the\nresults are examined and discrete business areas are\nidentified. These business areas are then examined in more\ndetail and the processes and data required to perform the\nactivities of the business are identified. In the process,\nopportunities for synergy are also identified. The results of\nthe BAA become the business requirements for the new\nintegrated application portfolio and are incorporated into\nthe application RFPs.\nProcess Documentation--Process documentation is only\nthe first in a series of steps that must be completed in order\nto change the way business is conducted at the agency. The\nobjective is to promote changes in business practices and\ninstall systems that enhance the overall efficiency and\neffectiveness of operations. It is necessary that all current\nbusiness practices be identified and their value to\nconducting business closely examined. New process\ndocumentation and new business procedures are identified\nthrough the BAA.\nPrepare Detailed Specifications--The projects selected\nfor implementation then require complete specifications and\nidentification. Functional and technical requirements will be\ndeveloped for the projects. Department directors review and\nsign off on these requirements.\nIssue RFP--These requirements will be incorporated\ninto an RFP, which is prepared by the IT organization, with\nthe assistance of the procurement and legal departments,\nand issued to appropriate vendors.\nEvaluate Vendor Proposals/Vendor Selection--Both an\nIT project manager and user staff participate in the\npreliminary evaluation of the vendor proposals received and\nin any oral presentations. Once a vendor is selected,\nmembers of the project committee will work with the\nvendor and the project manager to ensure that the delivered\nsystem meets the agency's specifications and standards.\nComplete Test Plan/Test System/Conduct Training--\nExtensive testing and training is required before a system is\nfinally placed into operation. Test plans are developed by\ntechnical and user members of the project committee under\nthe supervision of the IT quality assurance group (see\nManagement Architecture), which would enable the agency\nto verify that the new system provides the necessary\ninformation and satisfies all specifications. All interfaces\nwith other systems are included in this test plan. Users in\nthe various functional areas need training in the use of the\nnew systems and in the changes in the way their jobs are\nconducted. The RFP specifies who is to provide that\ntraining.\n\nFIGURE 3 LACMTA enterprise business model.\nFIGURE 4 Entity-relationship diagram.\n\nUse New System--The new system is now ready for use.\nResults are carefully monitored through a formal\nperformance measurement system.\nCOMPONENTS OF THE APPLICATION ARCHITECTURE\nIn leading edge agencies, applications architecture is a\nbyproduct of the BPR process. In the transit industry, the\napplication processing systems can usually be divided into\nfour primary groups that match the organization of most\nagencies:\noperations,\nfinance,\nadministration,\nand\ntechnology.\nOperations Systems\nOperations systems include all necessary information and\nsystems required to support the operating (bus and rail)\ndepartments. This includes some common systems such as\nsecurity and SCADA systems. It also includes the special\nsystems required to provide bus and rail services. Some of\nthese systems include scheduling, operations control\nsystems, electronic fare collection, vehicle maintenance,\nand ITS/APTS. It also includes all necessary information\nand systems required to provide support for operating and\nmaintaining bus and train service, including scheduling,\nrouting, dispatching, operator payroll, maintenance, safety,\nand work orders (Figure 5).\nFinancial/Accounting Systems\nFinancial/accounting systems include all the functions of\naccounting and bookkeeping (i.e., general ledger, accounts\npayable, capital programming, etc.), as well as fixed assets.\nAll special financial reporting also falls into this category.\nAdministrative Systems\nAdministration systems include information used to support\ngeneral agency management requirements, including\npurchasing, materials management, customer information,\naffirmative action, document management, employee\ninformation, jobs, and applicants including human\nresources information systems and payroll systems.\nTechnology Systems\nTechnology systems include all necessary information and\nsystems required to provide support for technology,\nengineering, and capital projects including CAD, project\ncontrol, GIS, and the voice and data-based radio system.\nAt leading edge agencies, projects are considered based\non their relative importance to the entire business needs of\nthe\norganization.\nIn\norder\nof\nimportance,\nthese\nclassifications\nFIGURE 5 Delivery of public transportation.\n\nFIGURE 6 IT infrastructure.\nwould include infrastructure projects, organization-wide\nprojects, and departmental projects as defined here.\nInfrastructure Projects\nInfrastructure projects are necessary for and fundamental to\nthe implementation of a multitude of technologies and not\nsingle applications. These projects provide the fundamental\nbuilding blocks of technology necessary to implement most\nother projects and without which the entire technology and\napplication architecture cannot be advanced. Infrastructure\nprojects facilitate the exchange of information and tie the\nagency together. Examples include network upgrading and\ninstallation of more LANs throughout an agency.\nOrganization-Wide Projects\nOrganization-wide projects are applications that can be used\nby most business entities within the agency to satisfy a\nbusiness need and provide management data allowing for\ninformed management decision making. Examples of\norganization-wide projects include human resources,\naccounts payable, and accounts receivable systems.\nDepartmental Projects\nDepartmental projects are projects specific to the\ntechnology needs of each department.\nThe central assumption of the application architecture\narising from the BPR process is the sharing of data among\napplications as needed to provide a fully integrated system\ncapability. Integration enables an agency to leverage\navailable data to provide increased quality of information\nfor management use while reducing data redundancy and\nthe effort to maintain duplicative data. The second key\nassumption is that the BPR will identify applications that\ncan be used by multiple departments and that would be\ndefined and procured with the joint cooperation of the\nbusiness units and the IT organization. [The \"bubble\" chart\n(Figure 6) graphically represents how COTS application\ngroups interact through a common IT infrastructure and are\nsupported by agency-wide architectures and standards.]\nENABLING TECHNOLOGIES\nBased on the surveys, interviews, and site visits there were\na number of specific technologies identified that can be\nclassified as enabling technologies. Enabling technologies\nare defined as technologies that can be used by many\ndifferent types of applications to achieve desired business\nresults. A description of some of the principal enabling\ntechnologies and their possible uses follows.\nBar Coding\nBar coding is a simple, straightforward system enabling\ntechnology to be used with other systems and products to\nachieve an end result, such as identification of equipment.\n\nIt is a mature technology that allows a user to link an object\n(equipment, drawing, or document) to a database that\ncontains detailed information. Bar codes are a subset of\nautomatic identification technology, which includes other\ntechnologies such as magnetic strip reading, radio\nfrequency\ndata\ncommunication,\nradio\nfrequency\nidentification, contact memory tags, electronic data\ninterchange, mobile computing, smart card, optical card,\noptical character recognition, biometrics, voice recognition,\nand other emerging technologies.\nSome of the possible uses of bar coding in transit\nagencies include inventory control, materials management,\nsecurity access, shipping and receiving, and tracking the\nmovement of buses and rail cars. Some transit agencies\ncurrently use bar coding for all equipment identification,\nwith periodic inventory checks conducted in each\ndepartment and master inventory lists updated through bar\ncode usage. This bar coding results in better inventory\ntracking and loss prevention, thereby saving both time and\nmoney.\nComputer-Aided Design Engineering Drawings Scanned\nand Integrated\nCurrent technologies and systems allow organizations to\nscan original engineering drawings and convert these\ndrawings into digital data to be used by current CAD\nsystems. Once scanned, quality checked, and stored, these\nelectronic\nCAD\ndrawings\ncan\nbe\nmodified\nwith\nindustrystandard drawing packages. Some transit agencies\n(e.g., Metra) are requiring contractors to supply \"as-built\"\nengineering drawings in a standard format (e.g., AutoCAD).\nBuilding modifications can then immediately be integrated\ninto these drawings.\nElectronic Forms\nMultiple software packages exist that allow for the creation\nof electronic forms on the computer that may be filled in,\nrouted, approved, and secured. These forms can be tied to\ndatabases that allow the data to be secured separately and\nlinked with the form when necessary, thus saving storage\nspace on computer systems. These electronic documents\nmay be routed through normal electronic mail systems and\nhave varying levels of security to address almost any\nrequirement. The use of electronic forms eliminates the cost\ninvolved in printing, distributing, and storing hard-copy\nforms. It also ensures that the current version of a form is\nused.\nElectronic Signatures/Authorizations\nComputer software and hardware allow for the secure\nrecording of signatures for the authorization of an action.\nFor example, software exists to support Microsoft Word\n(and WordPerfect) which links the electronic office to the\nrealities of the paper-based world by integrating the security\nof signed, original paper documents with the convenience,\nflexibility, and control provided by computercreated\ndocuments. Actual signing of a document can take place\nwith pressure sensitive devices linked to a computer or\nsecure images of signatures, and the appropriate security\nmeasures will allow only the approved insertion of\nsignatures. Once approved, the software will note any\nchanges made to the approved item and in essence negate\nthe validity of the signature and maintain an audit trail of\nactions. Similarly, electronic authorization can be used for\nbudgetary and purchasing approvals. Appropriate security\nand safeguards can be established to ensure the proper level\nof safety.\nGeographic Information System Data\nGIS data are a set of data that allows for the integration of\nphysical space information [geographic, man-made objects,\nlocation (spatial and absolute)] to other sources of\ninformation. Decisions on the format of the GIS are critical\nto its usage. The linkage of GIS data with the\naforementioned CAD engineering drawings facilitates\nbuilding management, repair, and alterations. GIS data are\nalso an important component of ITS/APTS and require\nlinks to all systems of local jurisdiction.\nImaging\nImaging involves the electronic storage of any image\n(picture, document, photograph, drawing, etc.) in a\nspecified industry standard format. The image may be\ndisplayed and can be manipulated with the appropriate\nsoftware. If the image is stored on a \"non-writeable\"\nmedium, then the original image cannot be altered without\nphysically destroying the storage media, thus ensuring\nsecurity. Images consume large amounts of space on\nstorage systems and usually require the use of compression\ntechniques to minimize the storage impacts. Image servers\nand jukeboxes can be placed at strategic locations. The\nlegal requirements for electronic document storage and\nvalidity in court proceedings must be closely investigated\nand monitored to ensure that these electronic documents\nwill have legal validity when needed.\nInternet Access/Home Page\nBased on survey results and site visits, many transit\nagencies still have no or a relatively small number of\nemployees with access to the Internet through a commercial\nservice. Many agencies have recently developed their own\n\nInternet home pages. Where this exists, policies and\nprocedures are being established for the use and control of\ninformation on the home and subsequent pages.\nFull organization Internet connectivity hinges on the\nestablishment of a full corporate network backbone so that\nall users have the physical capability to gain an Internet\nconnection. The home page is used by some agencies to\nprovide train and/or bus schedule information. The Internet\nhome page can also serve as a source of advertising of\nagency services. RFPs and information to disadvantaged\n(minority- or woman-owned) business enterprises are also\ncurrently published by some agencies on the Internet, thus\nreducing the cost of printing and mailing. Care is taken by\nsome agencies to ensure that small and disadvantaged\nbusinesses that are not Internet users are not eliminated\nfrom the bidding process. Descriptions of available jobs are\nalso posted and applicant resumes stored on the Internet.\n(An overview of the New York MTA's web site has been\nincluded in Appendix D.)\nIntranet\nThe Intranet is an internal system that allows all\ndepartments of an organization to share and exchange\ninformation. It uses the graphical user interface look of an\nInternet browser to link various systems, databases, and\nsources of information to the user community. Regardless\nof the underlying source of information (platform, location,\ndatabase), this interface allows the user access to data\nwithout having to know what database, program, or system\nthe information is coming from. This can allow the end-user\nsimpler access to and use of legacy systems (until they are\nreplaced). The technical staff is required to develop the\nappropriate codes and interfaces to keep the user shielded\nfrom the details of the particular system, while allowing full\naccess (within the security guidelines of the organization) to\ninformation. In some instances, the Intranet is also used by\nagencies to provide user training.\nSome of the agencies participating in this survey have\nbegun limited implementation of their own Intranet\nfacilities. However, most agencies surveyed still have no\ndedicated staff supporting Intranet development and\nmaintenance.\nLocal Area Network/Wide Area Network Connectivity\nIn leading agencies surveyed, LANs and WANs are\nconnected to get the full synergistic effect of systems and\ninformation. Regardless of the actual network used by any\ncomponent of an agency, there are hardware and software\nsolutions that allow these networks to interface and share\ninformation across the organization. At these agencies\ndecisions are made and policies and procedures formulated\nto control their networks to allow for the apparent seamless\nintegration by the user community.\nRemote Field Access\nIn some cases (e.g., LACMTA), transit agency personnel\nwith portable computers or desktop computers are able to\naccess any authorized computer through standard phone\nlines and modems. Additionally, cellular telephone service\nlinks hand-held and laptop units to central agency systems\nfor data entry and retrieval. Various security techniques and\nsystems exist to control this access. Storing user phone\nnumbers and using a dial back capability is one method\nidentified for providing security. Communication servers\nand modem pools can also be used to support remote field\naccess.\nVideoconferencing\nVideoconferencing is being used by several of the larger\nagencies surveyed (e.g., New York MTA). Videoconfer\nencing can encompass two forms: desktop and conference.\nThe conference mode is the classic meeting room or video\nstudio with various locations linked together for a\nconference. Users congregate in a specified location and a\ntwoway interactive meeting can be held.\nDesktop conferencing is now available that allows users\nat a PC desktop to conduct smaller conferences without\nhaving to leave their offices. It is also possible to have\ndesktop conferences with any person connected to the\nInternet using common video protocols. This requires that\nthe necessary hardware and software be distributed to all\nauthorized individuals. This will also require the upgrade of\nthe backbone and cable to the desktop.\nThe electronic companion to videoconferencing that is\nprobably more important and beneficial to the users of such\na system is a collaborative work environment. Software will\nallow multiple users to access the same information in real\ntime and make comments or corrections to that information\nfrom wherever they are located. All parties can view and\nimplement modifications made by all of the participants and\nagree on a final version on-line. The host can then save the\nfinal version of the document (image, picture, drawing,\netc.), and all parties can then apply their electronic signature\nto secure the final version.\nCOMMON SYSTEM SUPPORT\nThe following are some of the common system supports\nidentified by our survey, interviews, and site visits that are\nnow available at some agencies:\n\nCommon vendor database--Because of the magnitude\nof work and activities, some agencies have developed a\ncommon vendor database of information concerning the\nvendors used by the various departments within the agency.\nInformation regarding past, current, and potential vendors,\nsupplies, and services to an agency are stored and retrieved\nfrom the database. Problem vendors are identified more\nreadily. Such a system also allows the agency the\nopportunity to realize economic benefits by combining\norders to particular vendors to receive the maximum bulk\norder discounts possible.\nData warehouse--Data warehousing is a term applied to\nCOTS products that support the integrated information\nrequirements of the enterprise. A data warehouse supports\nthe analysis and decision support requirements of the entire\nbusiness organization. The data warehouse is uniquely\npositioned in the corporate architecture to provide heuristic\ninformation from data integrated to many sources over time.\nA data warehouse has the capacity to do the following:\no Detail and summarize data for decision support and\nanalysis;\no Integrate data from multiple sources;\no Drive the design by evolving information needs;\no Orient by business area, function, or subject;\no Provide integrated information across the entire\norganization;\no Design granularity of data suitable for analysis over\nextended periods of time;\no Provide multiple levels of summarization; and\no Provide clean, current, reliable information to\nbusiness areas.\nThe purpose of the data warehouse is to provide users\nwith the right data at the right time to make business\ndecisions. The warehouse must be concerned with the\nquality and usability of the data. Operational data will often\nnot suffice without a measure of summarization and\n\"scrubbing.\" Business requirements, not technology, must\ndrive the data warehouse. The following approach or\nmethodology is often used for data warehouse development:\no Identify or determine data requirements needed to\nproduce critical business or operational decisions--\nthis can be accomplished as part of an agency BPR\nprocess;\no Identify or determine key data sources and volumes;\no Identify or determine deliverables with business or\noperational benefits;\no Perform hardware and software selection;\no Construct data warehouse\nß Data extraction and cleansing,\nß Logical and physical database design, and\nß Software integration;\no Production\nß Discovery and query,\nß Analysis and confirmation, and\nß Presentation.\nTo preserve the investment that many transit agencies\nhave made in mainframe computers, the mainframe can be\nused as the repository for the data warehouse with\nworkstation-based query tools. This would require that\nappropriate data from the new (presumably client/server\nsystems with databases on LANs) application systems be\nidentified and transferred periodically to the mainframe.\nThis data identification and transfer requires special\ncustomized programs to extract the data and other programs\nto transfer the data at the appropriate times.\nDocument management--Electronic document man\nagement involves the storing of an electronic document or\nits image on a computer and linking key information from\nthat document to a search engine. Software exists that\nallows full-text search of electronic documents, but it\nrequires key words or descriptors to be entered for imaged\ndocuments.\nQuery tools--Various departments and users at all\ntransit agencies have a need for query tools that are user\nfriendly and allow for the accumulation of information by\nthe average business user. Simple query tools configured to\nprocess the contents of the data warehouse allow the\ngeneral populace to formulate requests for information and\nto receive the information without having to ask for\nspecialized assistance. Using such query tools, users in the\nvarious departments can easily be trained to create and\nperform queries on their own, without the continuing need\nfor support from the IT department.\nSingle sign-on--The user communities at most transit\nagencies are well served by a single sign-on capability (that\nis, the ability to sign-on to all systems with a single\npassword entry) to access an agency's networks and\ncomputer systems. Where this is being implemented, a\ntransit agency performs a risk assessment and management\nevaluation of this technique. If such a program is instituted,\nthen additional security safeguards are instituted to protect\nthe organization's data. These additional safeguards include\n\"smart cards,\" fingerprint ID, and periodic confirmation of\nuser ID. The methods to be used are based on the risk\nassessment performed on the various portions of an\nagency's\nsystems\nand\nthe\ncosts\nassociated\nwith\nimplementing the security method.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe current migration strategy in IT is toward open system\narchitecture, which employs standard, vendor-developed,\n\nsupplied, and supported COTS application software to\nreplace the older, custom-built, current applications\nenvironment. This new approach allows users to share\ncommon data throughout the organization. An open\narchitecture implies interconnectivity between information\nsystems, which allows for the access, transfer, and\nmanipulation of data, to the greatest extent possible, by\nauthorized users throughout an entire organization. An open\narchitecture requires the coordination of computing\nfacilities,\noperating\nsystems,\nand\ncommunication\ninfrastructure. This architecture is used as the overall\nguideline for developing the information resources to meet\nthe information needs of transit agencies. Data sharing\nrequires that application systems be agency owned rather\nthan department owned. Most of these open architecture\napplications will be distributed client/server or cooperative\ncomputing, rather than mainframe-based systems. Most\nmodern client/server systems can be described as either\ndistributed function or remote data management. Agencies\nthat have moved in this direction include the Port Authority\nof Allegheny County, WMATA, and The Port Authority of\nNew York and New Jersey.\nRemote data management requires that all application\nlogic and processing be done on workstations, while the\nserver runs only DBMS processes. It is generally accepted\nthat applications be designed and installed as networkbased\nwith multiple-user licenses. This will alleviate and/or\neliminate inconsistent software versions and make software\nupgrade simpler.\nDistributed function architecture allows the design of\nthe system to allocate processing to the platform best suited\nfor the task; therefore, optimization for performance can\nmore easily be accomplished. System design can minimize\nnetwork traffic by executing large data volume processes on\nthe server and transmitting the results across the network.\nSome central processing unit (CPU)-intensive functions can\nbe run on the workstations to reduce the load on the server.\nAs a result of the flexibility of this scenario, most large and\ncomplex client/server systems developed today fall into the\ndistributed function technical architecture design. Most\nvendors of client/server software either distribute their\nprocessing in this manner or are implementing this type of\narchitecture. Most products are still designed using a two-\ntiered architecture.\nAt these leading agencies, the technology type and\nprocessing tiers of an individual application are reviewed\nand given consideration in application selection. Most\napplication packages today are two-tiered. The complexity\nof adding and supporting a third processing tier is carefully\nreviewed against the business requirements in the selection\nprocess. Therefore, new business applications for transit\nagencies are executing on two tiers of processors--client\nworkstations and a database server. Agencies with\nmainframes can use them as a source of legacy maintained\ndata. Business processes do not execute on this platform\nbeyond some data transfer.\nAn organization-wide telecommunications network is\nthe most current approach to support the client/server\napplications\nenvironment.\nThis\napproach\nrequires\nenhancements to the WAN to turn it into a full\norganization-wide network supporting all of an agency's\nfacilities. It would be expected that many more users would\nrequire access to the new applications and therefore to the\nnetwork. Additional PCs and network connections would be\nneeded to support this data-sharing environment. All staff at\nan agency may be required to interact with these new\nsystems. Training would be reduced because the new\nclient/server applications would use GUIs rather than\ncharacter-based input for screen manipulation. Extensive\nhelp is built into the applications, facilitating their ease of\nuse.\nSoftware applications may be acquired as suites from a\nsingle vendor or a series of \"best-of-breed\" open architec\nture applications. The advantages of obtaining a suite of\nsoftware from a single vendor are that the applications more\nreadily integrate with each other and that they have the\nsame look and feel. The advantages of best-of-breed are\nthat each application module is the best that can be found.\nHowever, they will not automatically integrate, nor will\nthey necessarily have the same look and feel. It is generally\neasier and faster to acquire and implement a suite of new\napplications from the same vendor. Regardless of whether\napplications are best of breed or single vendor it is still very\nimportant that the end-user community (consisting of the\nappropriate department's staff) and the IT organization are\ninvolved in selecting the new applications. The Port\nAuthority of New York and New Jersey used a best of\nbreed approach in its recent financial/human resources\nsoftware acquisition, whereas the Port Authority of\nAllegheny County used a single vendor approach.\nCare must be taken to ensure that the need to acquire\nproven COTS software, with at most limited customization,\nis recognized. This can be done if those involved in design\nand selection recognize that the individual transit agency is\na business like other transit organizations, is not unique, and\ncan take advantage of the expertise of the vendors.\nCustomization requirements are examined critically and\nextensively cost-justified in agencies using this approach.\n\nCHAPTER FOUR\nTECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE\nINTRODUCTION\nBased on the survey's site visits and IT planning documents,\nthe technical computing environment at most large transit\nagencies (e.g., MBTA, CTA, and AC Transit) is usually\nsplit into three distinct and separate environments:\n1. The organization-wide systems (generally financial,\nadministrative, and accounting) controlled by the IT\ndepartment.\n2. Business systems acquired by individual depart\nments, but then managed and supported by the IT\ndepartment.\n3. Business systems acquired, managed, and supported\nby the individual departments.\nThe purpose of a conceptual technical architecture is to\ndevelop guidelines for the enhancement and support of an\nagency's existing technical environment. This will enable a\ntransit agency to plan for and align future business\nrequirements with information processing resources over\nthe next several years. This section deals primarily with the\nhardware, network capabilities, and data management that\nmake up the technical architecture. (See Appendix E for a\ntechnical architecture overview of a large agency--The Port\nAuthority of New York and New Jersey.)\nBecause of the many user requirements for access to\ncommon data and the multiplicity of current computer\nplatforms in every transit agency, leading agencies such as\nWMATA and the Port Authority of Allegheny County, are\nmigrating toward a modern, open architecture technical\nenvironment. An open architecture implies intercon\nnectivity between information systems that allows for the\ngreatest access, transfer, and manipulation of data by\nauthorized users throughout the whole organization. An\nopen architecture requires the coordination of computing\nfacilities,\noperating\nsystems,\nand\ncommunication\ninfrastructures. This architecture can be used as the overall\nstandard for developing the information resources to meet\nthe information needs of a transit agency.\nNew systems being installed at leading transit agencies\nshare a common operating system and a common database\nstructure. Applications and data for the system reside at the\nmost appropriate user level and are available on a \"need-to\naccess\" basis. In addition, dedicated hardware manages the\nnetwork handling data flow and communications. This\nbasic configuration supports operations across the business-\ncomputing environment at leading agencies.\nLeading agencies with mainframes are migrating these\nplatforms to organization-wide data warehouses, where data\nfrom different systems can be stored and accessed for an\nexecutive information system, management reporting, data\nretrieval, and downloading for data analysis.\nSurvey results, interviews, and site visits indicate that\nmost transit agencies have very diverse technology\nplatforms. At large agencies, financial and administrative\nsystems are usually supported by mainframe computers\nrunning an MVS operating system. Other departments are\nfrequently supported by PCs and LAN-based servers. PCs\nare used for a variety of applications, including word\nprocessing, electronic mail, spreadsheets, and numerous\nadjunct database systems. The number of PCs and their\ndeployment is partially a function of a particular department\nallotting some of its overall budget to the purchase of IT\ndevices.\nSome facilities at transit agencies have connections from\ntheir LANs to the WAN, but in large transit agencies there\nis often a lack of connectivity between LANs within the\nsame department. Some departments acquire their own\ntelecommunication (T1 telephone) lines rather than use an\nagency's WAN services. There are frequently a large\nnumber of individual department LANs throughout most\nagencies. Many run different versions of a network\noperating system. It is not unusual to find some UNIX, IBM\nLANServer, and Windows for Workgroups LANs within\nthe same agency. Leading agencies have a single standard\nfor everyone.\nSTANDARDS\nAgencies as diverse as WMATA, Tri-Rail (South Florida),\nand\nthe Ann Arbor\nTransportation\nAuthority\nare\nestablishing organization-wide standards for hardware and\nsoftware. A lack of standards results in the need for\nadditional training in application usage, a potential for the\ninability to share data, and the need for technical support\nrequirements. Application packages that use standard\nproducts are being acquired in preference to other products\nand agencies are increasingly specifying those standards in\nall agency RFPs. This requirement reduces support costs\nand staffing and also makes data integration easier. The\ncompatibility of an application package with the agency\nstandards is preferable, but the underlying business\nfunctionality still needs to drive the application package\nselection criteria.\n\nHardware standards are also being established for\ndifferent purposes, both at the PC and the server levels.\nMinimum requirements for processor capability, random\naccess memory (RAM), disk space, etc., are ascertained for\ndifferent user, networking, and software levels. Computer\nequipment becomes obsolete very quickly, making higher\nend machines more cost effective in the long run. The PC\nstandards can vary by application usage. Thus, a PC used\nonly for word processing does not require the same\nprocessing power as one used for CAD. Similarly, printer\nand server standards can be specified for different\napplications and user bases. Print, communication,\nstructured query language (SQL), and application servers\nare required as client/server applications are obtained and\ninstalled. The print and communication servers are\nincreasingly PC based.\nUpgrading and replacing workstation equipment, such\nas PCs and printers, at regular intervals is part of a\nprogressive agency's technology investment strategy. Some\ntransportation organizations, such as the NYCT, replace\ntheir workstation equipment every 5 years as part of their\nCapital Program. Equipment is replaced or upgraded sooner\nif needed to support a particular application. Agencies are\nincreasingly leasing their workstations and peripherals\nrather than buying them, because it is generally cheaper,\neasier to maintain, and keeps the technology current.\nConsistent with the need to promote standards and\ncontrol technology investment, leading IT departments are\nestablishing and publishing a list of generic personal\ncomputer hardware and software standards appropriate for\ndifferent classes of staff level and software usage (e.g.,\nsecretary/word\nprocessing\nsoftware,\nengineer/CAD\nsoftware). Procurement and the IT department then work\ntogether to establish vendor relationships and term contracts\nfor these items. An agency catalog from which these\nhardware and software items can be selected is developed in\nhard copy and electronic format.\nIncreasingly, all software is acquired with network\nlicenses and vendor maintenance agreements. The impact of\nnetwork-based systems is factored into the communications\nplan to ensure appropriate response time. The impact can\nalso be factored into the server configurations to ensure that\nsufficient capacity is provided.\nFor those transit agencies with mainframes, it is\nexpected that mainframe applications will need continuing\nbudgetary and staff support for a number of years. This\nmeans that some programming and operations support will\nbe needed into and beyond the year 2000. In those agencies,\nconsideration is given to the need to share data between\nnew client/server systems and old legacy systems. Many of\nthese legacy systems are \"closed\" architecture and do not\neasily share data with other applications.\nThe mainframe platform can evolve from a platform\nhousing many applications to the organization-wide data\nwarehouse, where data from different systems can be stored\nand accessed for an executive information system,\nmanagement reporting, and data retrieval and downloading\nfor data analysis. Report generators are able to access the\ndata and provide important executive information in the\nform of management reports.\nCOMPONENTS OF THE TECHNOLOGY ARCHITECTURE\nTechnical architecture consists of the following primary\ncomponents:\no Hardware,\no Network capabilities, and\no Data management.\nHardware\nAs previously stated, the current business computing\nenvironment at most transit agencies is quite varied, with\nmany different hardware platforms and a large number of\nassorted workstations and peripherals (see The Port\nAuthority of New York and New Jersey technical\narchitecture description in Appendix E.) Many agencies\nhave current plans that call for adding, replacing, and\nupgrading\ntheir\nworkstations\nand\nperipherals\nand\nnetworking them within the next 12 to 16 months. The\nsubsequent summary describes the recommended hardware\nand software strategies that many agencies (e.g., WMATA,\nthe Port Authority of Allegheny County, LACMTA, and\nOCTA) are following over the next several years:\no The future of the currently installed applications of\nmost agencies is focused on the replacement by\nclient/server\nworkstation-based\nproducts.\nThe\ndeployment of this concept requires significant\ncommitment to workstation-based architectures. The\nworkstation equipment employed will be kept\ncurrent by a regular upgrade and replacement policy.\no Many of the mainframe applications are being\nreplaced by new client/server applications. Reliance\non the mainframe will decrease over time as new\napplications are added and data migrated to the new\npackages. Integration between the new systems and\nsome older systems may be required, either\ntemporarily or permanently. The mainframe can be\nused as the corporate data warehouse.\no The WAN and the department LANs are included in\nplanning for the system. The requisite hardware and\nsoftware is incorporated in the budget and imple\nmented as needed. Full LAN/WAN connectivity\nthroughout an agency is needed to take advantage of\n\nthe new distributed client/server applications and to\nmaximize the ability to use and analyze data at the\nworkstation to produce management information.\no Rapid application development (RAD) and CASE\ntechnology are being used for the development of\nany product and this is usually done by in-house\nstaff. Training in the use of CASE technology for\nproduct development is required in order to make\nfull use of the technology. This software portfolio\nincludes both upper and lower CASE tools as well as\ntesting and certification software.\no A compressed system development life cycle\n(SDLC) methodology is usually selected and em\nployed for all rapid development projects, and a full\nSDLC is used for developing the project plans for\nacquired products. The SDLC process is selectively\nemployed to produce fast business solutions. With\nrapidly changing technology and business needs it is\nno longer practical in most cases to completely\nfollow the older, full-scale, SDLC methodology.\nRather, RAD techniques are being followed.\nHistorically, in most transit agencies, the approach to the\nacquisition and deployment of microcomputers and\ncomputer applications has been very much a department by\ndepartment decision. Survey data and interviews indicated\nthat individual user departments, like finance, operations,\nand planning, buy and deploy much of their own PC\nequipment and software. IT departments are sometimes\nconsulted, but usually at the end of the process. With the\ndevelopment of IT plans at agencies like LACMTA and\nWMATA, the TAC (see chapter 2) and the IT department\nassume joint responsibility for the technical evaluation of\nall new requests for automation equipment including PCs.\nTechnology acquisitions, especially for desktop workstation\nequipment, increasingly come from a catalog developed by\nthe IT department.\nWithin agencies of all sizes there has been a significant\nacquisition of PCs and related equipment over the past\nseveral years. In an effort to achieve the greatest benefit and\nvalue from each technology purchase, these requests are\ncarefully reviewed in agencies that have developed a\ndetailed IT plan. This process usually includes a detailed\nevaluation of each submittal during the budget cycle.\nFollowing this evaluation, requests are presented to a TAC\nfor approval. Hardware specifications are developed for\ndifferent categories of user and software. In this approach, a\nTAC reviews and ranks each request based on strategic\ncriteria such as:\no Customer benefit,\no Cost savings to the agency,\no Compatibility with agency goals, and\no Replacement or upgrade of inefficient equipment.\nIn the IT planning approach, future PC acquisitions al\nlow for the management capabilities and recognized needs\nof an agency over a 3-year rolling time period. An impor\ntant consideration for this area is the use of LANs to link\nmicrocomputers with one another and the main network.\nThe major benefit of developing an open architecture is\nto enable computers to communicate with other computers\nacross an agency-wide environment. At an agency, this\ninvolves microcomputers communicating with other\nmicrocomputers within LANs, over the WAN, or to the\nmainframe or other business application computers. In\nsome instances, this requires dedicated hardware and\nsoftware to handle communications and transaction\nprocessing between the various platforms. Developing this\nopen architecture will require coordination of hardware\nplatforms, operating systems, and network management to\ndevelop an effective and efficient combination of resources.\nTransit agencies with detailed IT plans usually also\ndevelop and maintain comprehensive communications\nplans, including those for wiring, hardware, and software.\nThese plan subsets include provisions for maintaining the\ncommunications infrastructure in a current state as part of\nthe overall IT planning process. IT departments acquire\nhardware and software that support parallel processing or\nsymmetrical\nmulti-processing.\nRedundancy\nand\nserviceability are also key considerations, especially for\nmissioncritical applications. Clusters of multiple servers\nsharing the CPU load and sharing a common database are\none possibility for this redundancy. Another is the use of\ndisk duplexing, so that data are duplicated automatically on\na second set of disks. This may also increase response times\nand loads on the server.\nNetwork Capabilities\nSurvey results, interviews, and IT plans indicate that at\nmost transit agencies an increased WAN support is being\nimplemented. This is usually necessary to provide the\ncapability for full corporate-wide data sharing. The network\nconfiguration and planning ensures that the throughput and\nnetwork redundancy necessary for distributed client/server\napplications exists. Whether the processors are centrally\nhoused or are housed in different locations and require\naccess from many other locations, network performance\nand reliability will be critical to success. LAN support is\nprovided to all departments as needed and those department\nLANs are connected to the backbone network. This is\nnecessary to provide the capability for full data sharing\nacross the entire agency, from any location.\nThe purpose of these LANs is to improve efficiency\nwithin the organization. Specific benefits, in addition to\ndata sharing and application integration, are expected to\n\ninclude standardization of applications and reduction of\nsoftware costs; reduction in equipment needs (i.e., printers,\nfaxes, modems, etc.); electronic transmittal of data\ninformation, mail, \"calendaring,\" and scheduling; and the\ndevelopment and use of electronic forms. Software\nupgrades can also be distributed over the network.\nTransmission\ncontrol\nprotocol/Internet\nprotocol\n(TCP/IP) is considered to be the internetwork protocol\nstandard for the industry. As more agency employees are\ngiven Internet access, providing and maintaining address\ninformation will become more important. The TCP/IP\npackage also supports terminal emulation, simple network\nmanagement protocol network management, Microsoft's\nOLE (Object Linking and Embedding) for desktop\napplication integration, and MAPI (Messaging Application\nProgram Interface) for enabling electronic mail.\nCommon security for electronic mail is provided by the\npublic domain encryption software PGP (Pretty Good\nPrivacy) and by S/MIME (Secure Multipurpose Internet\nMail Extension). IPSEC (Internet Protocol Extension)\nprovides more security and is being implemented by some\nTCP/IP providers.\nThe\ncabling,\nbridges,\nrouters,\nand\nall\nother\ncommunication equipment used in the networks allows for\nupgrades to 1000 Base-T Ethernet networks if that higher\nbandwidth is required in the future. At minimum, Category\n5 cabling is the normal standard. This standard appears to\nbe appropriate for the integration of voice and data\nnetworks and videoconferencing.\nData Management\nOpen architecture implies user access to a wide range of\ndata. Guidelines for the management of these data have\nemerged from the industry survey and interviews and are\ngenerally consistent with the broader state of the practice.\no Compatibility--A\nkey\nconcept\nof\nan\nopen\narchitecture is the ability to share data and\ninformation from a variety of databases across\ndifferent platforms. A significant amount of effort is\napplied to establishing data standards so that data can\nbe exchanged or easily converted to the proper\nformat for exchange.\no Security and Access--Another major concern of data\nmanagement is data integrity. Data are managed just\nlike other physical resources. The ability to access,\nchange, update, add, or delete data is closely\nmonitored and managed.\no Ease of Use--To the extent possible, data are kept\nreasonably easy to maintain and access. This means a\ndatabase management system that provides an SQL\ncapability.\nSQL\nprovides\nan\napplication-level\nstandard method for data exchange between different\ncomputing platforms.\no Scalability--Chosen applications, and the database\nitself, are not unduly limited by size and volume\nconsiderations. It is important that there be room for\nthe systems to grow, especially if system usage\nthroughout an agency spreads to other departments.\nAdherence to these general guidelines is seen by leading\nagencies as vital to achieving an effective open\narchitecture-based system, because the success of the\nsystem is largely dependent on the effective sharing of data\namong the users.\nE-Commerce\nAs indicated in the applications architecture, transit has just\nbegun to take advantage of the Internet/Intranet and web-\nenabled technologies; however, because these have such a\npotentially revolutionary effect on computing itself\n(hardware platforms and LAN/WAN infrastructures), E-\ncommerce needs to be considered in the context of technical\narchitecture. If, in fact, E-commerce becomes the principal\nmechanism for acquiring goods and services and the\nInternet/Intranet becomes the dominant communications\nvehicle, the effect on the technical infrastructure is\nprofound. The need for powerful PCs or other \"internal\"\ncomputing devices and robust LAN/WAN infrastructures\nbecomes potentially unnecessary or redundant in the world\nof E-commerce.\nE-commerce is a dynamic set of technologies,\napplications, and business processes that link enterprises,\nconsumers,\nand\ncommunities\nthrough\nelectronic\ntransactions and the electronic exchange of goods, services,\nand information. High-technology companies, banks,\nconsumer-packaged-goods companies, insurance providers,\neducational institutions, manufacturing firms, and even\nhealthcare providers are cutting costs and enhancing\nbusiness relationships by using the Internet and its\noffshoots, intranets and extranets.\nA recent survey by the Extraprise Group found that 40\npercent of surveyed firms already use their Intranets to\nsupport E-commerce. Forrester Research estimates that E-\ncommerce between businesses in the United States could\nreach $327 billion by 2002, and the International Data\nCorporation pegs the amount at more than $400 billion\n(4).\nE-commerce is not just about using the Web as a\n\"storefront.\" It involves shortening the supply chain,\nstreamlining distribution processes, improving product\ndelivery, reducing inventory-carrying costs, and many other\nmeasurable\nactivities.\nIn\nthe\nbusiness-to-business\n\nrealm, E-commerce strategies allow businesses to leverage\nelectronic alliances to speed the delivery of products and\nservices to market. Companies set up electronic linkages to\nwork more closely with their suppliers and save money on\ninventory and distribution costs.\nThere are three fundamental types of business-to\nbusiness\nE-commerce\nrelationships:\ntransactional,\ninformation sharing, and electronic collaboration.\nTransactional\nrelationships--Transactional\nrelation\nships often begin with electronic data interchange to\nautomate transactions such as purchase orders and invoices.\nThe promise of a high and easily quantifiable return on\ninvestment is enticing many companies to target indirect\nprocurement as the pilot application for their corporate E-\ncommerce initiatives.\nInternet-based procurement solutions leverage the\nInternet as a business and technology enabler, using\nworkflow-driven process automation and supply-chain\ncollaboration to streamline purchasing and reconcile\npayments. Once these solutions are in place, procurement\npersonnel are deployed strategically for analysis and sorting\ninstead of just for processing paper-based transactions.\nInformation sharing--Transactional relationships can\nprogress to information sharing as companies begin to\nexchange everything from product designs to production\nschedules online.\nElectronic collaboration--Electronic collaboration is\nthe final stage in most business-to-business electronic\nrelationships--two companies leveraging each other's\ninformation systems to enhance the overall customer\nexperience. Thanks to tight electronic links enabled by the\nInternet, global express-delivery companies like the United\nParcel Service (UPS) provide most of the shipping for\nseveral of the world's largest PC manufacturers.\nCONCLUSIONS\nLarge transit agencies such as The Port Authority of New\nYork and New Jersey, TTC, and WMATA, are developing\nfull corporate networks to support agency-wide, integrated,\nclient/server technology. Comprehensive network plans\nare evolving as more applications move from the\nmainframe at the data center to servers located at any\nfacility on the network. At these agencies the network will\nbe designed to support the integration of voice, video, and\ndata; provide proper quality of service connections; and\neventually support videoconferencing at an agency. Toward\nthis end, planning for the network should allow for general\nusage throughout an agency, with full LAN access as\nneeded. This may mean that network line capacity will need\nto be expanded to support higher traffic volumes. The\nnetwork is a primary component of all client/server\ntechnology. It will be necessary to expand network access\nto all user departments so that the corporate data can be\nshared. Capacity planning is an integral part of this\nnetwork expansion. A robust, organization-wide network\nrepresents a necessary part of the required technical\ninfrastructure and must be given high priority and\nimplemented for the other parts of client/server technology\nto succeed.\nIT staff at progressive agencies are trained in the latest\ntechnologies so that they can support the organization\nduring any migration period and continue to add value after\nall systems are client/server based.\nTraining for IT technical staff now includes:\no BPR,\no CASE tool usage,\no Compressed SDLC methodology,\no Database design,\no Networking,\no New computer languages (such as C and C++),\no Project management,\no RAD, and\no Test plan development.\nTechnology standards being\ndeveloped,\nupdated,\npublished, circulated, and enforced include:\no PC software and hardware standards,\no Security standards,\no Network standards for LANs and WANs,\no Platform standards,\no Turnkey systems standards, and\no System administration standards.\n\nCHAPTER FIVE\nITS/APTS ARCHITECTURE\nINTRODUCTION\nIn 1991, the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT)\nand the Intelligent Society of America (now called the\nIntelligent Transportation Society of America) were\ndirected by the U.S. Congress to develop an ITS\narchitecture that was compatible with the transportation\ntechnology in use nationally. Principal benefits of the\nNational ITS Architecture are:\no Integration of highway and transit systems,\no Price/performance options (multiple implementations),\no Data sharing,\no Increasing\nlevels\nof\nsystem\nintegration\nand\nperformance,\no Open standards to increase interoperability,\no Leveraging existing transportation infrastructure,\no Encouraging public/private partnerships, and\no Enhancing safety.\nCompleted in 1996, the resulting National ITS\nArchitecture provides a common structure for the design of\nintelligent\ntransportation\nsystems.\nAs\na\nunifying\narchitecture, the USDOT wanted to ensure that a nationally\ncompatible system was developed, linking all modes of\ntransportation. This architecture was designed to promote\nnational standards to accommodate intercity travel and\ncross country goods movements, while discouraging local\nor regional areas from developing incompatible systems.\nIn January 1996, U.S. Secretary of Transportation,\nFrederico Pena, announced a national goal, to \"implement\nthe Intelligent Transportation Infrastructure across the\nUnited States within a decade to save time and lives and to\nimprove [the] quality of life\" (5). The currently stated\nobjective of the USDOT is to deploy 75 integrated ITSs by\n2006. The architecture\ndefines the framework around which multiple design approaches can be\ndeveloped, each one specifically tailored to meet the individual needs of\nthe user, while maintaining the benefits of a common architecture. The\narchitecture defines the functions (e.g., gather traffic information or\nrequest a route) that must be performed to implement a given user service,\nthe physical entities or subsystems where these functions reside (e.g., the\nroadside or the vehicle), the interfaces/information flows between the\nphysical subsystems, and the communication requirements for the\ninformation flows (e.g., wireline or wireless). In addition, it identifies and\nspecifies the requirements for the standards needed to support national and\nregional interoperability, as well as product standards needed to support\neconomy of scale considerations in deployment (6).\nThe foundation of the architecture is a collection of\ninterrelated user services for application to the nation's\nsurface transportation problems. Thirty user services have\nbeen identified to date. The goal of the architecture program\nis to unify and organize user services and promote standards\nthat assure seamless operation of the system across the\ncountry (see Appendix F for the systems architecture\ninterconnect diagram, the user services table, and Web sites\nfor ITS standards).\nADVANCED PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS\nThe Federal Transit Administration established the\nAdvanced Public Transportation System (APTS) program\n\"to encourage the use of technology, to improve the quality\nand usefulness of transportation and ride sharing services.\nThe APTS program is testing these technologies, with many\nprojects involving the integration of multiple technologies.\nEffectively integrated and deployed, ITS technologies can\nenhance\nsafety,\ntransportation\nmobility,\noperational\nefficiency, and environmental protection (7). APTS consists\nof several subsystems including:\n1. Fleet Management\no Communications systems\no GISs\no AVLSs\no Automatic passenger counters (APCs)\no Transit operations software\nß Fixed-route bus\nß Rail\nß Paratransit\no Traffic signal priority.\n2. Traveler Information\no Pre-trip/en-route transit information systems\no In-terminal/wayside transit information systems\no In-vehicle transit information systems\no Multimodal traveler information systems.\n3. Electronic Fare Payment\no Automated fare payment systems.\n4. Transportation Demand Management\no Dynamic ridesharing\no Automated service coordination\no Transportation management centers\no High occupancy vehicle facility monitoring\no Mobility management.\n\nAPTS technology is perhaps best defined and examined\nin a series of publications produced by the USDOT on\nAPTS: \"Advanced Public Transportation Systems: The State\nof the Art Update '98\" and the Operation TimeSaver series\n[e.g., \"Intelligent Transportation Infrastructure Benefits:\nExpected and Experienced\" (8)]. These are complemented by\na detailed analysis of the broader ITS technologies in a report\nby Apogee Research and Wilbur Smith Associates as\ncommissioned by ITS America and the USDOT (9). Finally,\nthe Transportation Research Board through its TCRP has\nissued a series of reports on specific ITS technologies [e.g.,\n\"AVL Systems for Bus Transit\" (10)].\nHistorically, these systems and subsystems are quite\nnew to transit and the architecture defining and structuring\nthem newer still. As stated in TCRP Synthesis 24, on AVL,\none of the most complex and difficult of the APTS\ntechnologies:\n... the use of AVL in public transit has been slower in the United\nStates than in Canada and Europe. [These] systems were proposed in\nboth Europe and the United States in the 1960s ... The first\ndemonstration of AVL in Europe was in Hamburg, Germany in 1964.\nThe first major development in the United States occurred in 1968 ...\nwith the Chicago Transit Authority.\nSince 1969, with the advent of the first demonstration projects,\ntransit professionals, consultants, and operators have lauded the benefits\nof AVL, while remonstrating the expensive infrastructure costs.... Yet in\nthe last few years many transit agencies (more than 70 agencies in\nNorth America alone) have invested in the system concept (10).\nTwo examples of APTS activities have been included as\nAppendixes: Appendix G: The Ann Arbor Transportation\nAuthority Advanced Operating Project and Appendix H:\nStatus of NYC Transit Intelligent Transportation Systems\nProgram.\nISSUES AFFECTING THE USE OF APTS\nAPTS is an area of IT that highlights both some of the\ngreatest challenges and some of the greatest opportunities\nconfronting the transit industry. From the surveys,\ninterviews, and site visits with transit systems that have\ninvested in APTS technologies, there are a number of very\nsignificant issues facing the industry that need to be\naddressed in order to make APTS a cost-beneficial\ninvestment.\nInstitutional Barriers\nAs public entities, transit agencies operate under many real\nconstraints (e.g., governmental regulations, labor contracts,\nand political directives) that have always made \"running the\nservices like a business\" difficult and the cost-effective\nintroduction of advanced technologies even more arduous.\nGovernment\nrules\nforce\ntechnology\nproviders\nto\naccommodate regulatory obligations such as voice\nannunciation, full accessibility to vehicles, and special\nequipment like wheelchair lifts on entire fleets. Labor\ncontracts and labor provisions in the law create barriers for\nhow much can be expected of employees with regard to the\nuse of these technologies (e.g., in some systems, bus drivers\nhave refused to enter data with onboard devices, citing\nlabor rules). Politically motivated service decisions can\nsignificantly limit management's ability to use technology\nin the same way the private sector has--that is, to reduce\nthe labor force and make the operations more efficient and\neffective. For example, if bus routes cannot be changed\nbecause they are \"politically mandated,\" then the value of\nthe technologies that monitor route performance and\nfacilitate management decision making (such as altering\npoor performing routes and the attendant reduction in driver\nstaffing) is significantly reduced.\nInfrastructure Problems\nPublic agencies such as transit are often behind the tech\nnology curve and, in many cases, so far behind that intro\nducing sophisticated advanced technologies into old or\ninadequate environments is a major problem for both the\nagencies and the vendors and drives up the cost. As we\nhave already discovered, the IT infrastructures at most\ntransit agencies, into which these new technologies need to\nfit, are often antiquated, inconsistent, and insufficiently\nrobust to handle real-time data flow. IT department staffs\nare usually not equipped, trained, or positioned to manage\nthese complex advanced technologies. Frequently these IT\nstaffs are not involved in the design or acquisition of APTS\ntechnologies and consequently are left with only the\nproblems of integrating the data into the broader informa\ntion system of the agency after the fact. This situation is\nfurther aggravated by the technology platforms and tools\nbeing used by the APTS vendors (e.g., to appropriately\ndeploy a new AVL system that is client/server, Windows\nNT-based into an existing IT environment that is\nmainframe-based with little LAN/WAN infrastructure or\ncapacity, the installation of a single APTS system requires\naddressing the whole IT environment of the agency).\nBecause of the often archaic and inadequate IT\ninfrastructure in many transit agencies, the difficulty and\ncost of installing advanced technologies is dramatically\nincreased. To date, the key APTS vendors that are serving\nthis marketplace have had difficulty making profits and,\nuntil larger IT environmental issues are resolved, it will be\nimpossible to bring down the costs, particularly since the\nbig costs of APTS installation are still labor-based, not\nhardware/software-based (which is getting cheaper).\nArchitecture/Protocols\nThe current state of the IT environment in transit begs the\nlarger question about the state of architectural standards and\nindustry protocols. Although there are architectural\n\nstandards and an evolving set of protocols in North America\nand Europe (e.g., National ITS/ITI, CEN278, ISO204, etc.),\nand there are active working groups such as the Transit\nCommunications\nInterface\nProfiles\ncommittee\nand\nsubcommittee, we are not yet close to an environment\nwhere transit agencies can \"plug and play.\" There are still a\nnumber of closed architecture systems being sold by\nadvanced technology vendors and, despite the evolution of\nprototype bus development like the Advanced Technology\nTransit Bus, the industry is still a long way from technology\ncompatibility. Every time an additional piece of the APTS\narchitecture is added to the core system it becomes more\ncumbersome and more difficult to support.\nAn additional architectural issue arises because the\nprimary vendors of APTS have previously been defense\ncontractors that developed these core technologies for very\ndifferent\npurposes;\nthese\nAPTS\nproducts\nwere\n\"architectured\" in such a way that expanding their use to\nand integrating them with other transit technologies (while\nkeeping the costs low) has been very difficult, because\nmuch of the \"intelligence\" is on the vehicle and not in the\ncontrol centers.\nIntegration Issues\nIf the institutional setting for transit limits the managerial\nvalue of much of the new technologies, if the IT\nenvironments are not suited to and can't adequately support\nthe introduction of advanced technologies, and if the\narchitectures and protocols are not sufficiently in place,\nintegration of the APTS technologies becomes very difficult\nand only with integration can the real value of APTS be\nrealized. The pieces of APTS by themselves provide greatly\nreduced value to management decision making. When they\nare deployed in an integrated management approach and\neffectively linked to the broader information systems\nenvironment of the agency, they create a powerful and\ndynamic set of tools. Harnessed together, they make up far\nmore than the sum of their parts. For example, APCs can\nprovide passive information on ridership volume and\nboarding/alighting, but coupled with advanced fare cards\nand AVL, management can also know the type of client by\ntime of day and communicate critical vehicle information to\ndispatch additional vehicles or do route deviation while\nproviding customer information on the condition of the\nservice, all in real time.\nIn retrospect, it is still questionable that the public in\nvestment in APTS prototype systems has really been pro\nductive or a wise use of public finances. Growing evidence\nwould seem to indicate that until these products became\ncommercially available (e.g., rental car and trucking\nnavigational systems) and went through mass production,\nthey had not been either cost effective or fully functional.\nCOST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS OF APTS\nUnderstanding the very real limitations imposed by the\ninstitutional barriers, the infrastructure problem, the\nincomplete state of the architecture/protocols, and the\nintegration requirements, there is a growing body of\ninformation on the cost-benefits of APTS technologies.\nAlthough much of the data are \"soft,\" several of the current\nAPTS projects are looking at ways to measure the \"hard\"\nbenefits that directly translate into financial equations.\nBased on data collected for the USDOT Operations\nTimeSaver project (8), specific benefits include the\nfollowing:\no Fleet reduction--Transit agencies have been able to\nreduce fleet size from 2 to 5 percent because of the\nincreased efficiencies of bus use. The TTC increased\nthe usage of its fleet up to 25 percent on some routes.\no Improved travel time--Travel time is being reduced\nin some agencies up to 18 percent. The Kansas City\nArea Transportation Authority reduced its scheduled\ntravel time by up to 10 percent.\no Schedule adherence and management of \"bus\nbunching\"--Transit agencies are reporting up to 40\npercent reduction in \"off-schedule\" buses. Baltimore\nMTA reported a 23 percent improvement in \"on\ntime\" performance on their AVL-equipped buses.\no Safety and security of passengers and drivers--Real\ntime location assures that buses are continuously\nmonitored and with real-time schedule information\npassengers spend less time at bus stops. Some\nagencies report incident response time of as little as 2\nminutes, whereas others report reductions of about\n40 percent.\no Communication of major mechanical and diagnostic\ninformation on buses--On board data collection\nincludes on-time performance, bus speed, mileage,\npassenger activity, lift usage, and arrival/departure\ntimes. In addition to significant reduction in the\nmanual labor of collecting information, emergency\nvehicles can be dispatched quickly and accurately in\nthe event of problems.\no Passengers per mile and per hour--Flexible\ndispatching in paratransit and route deviation and\nreal-time schedule information on fixed routes have\nincreased the number of passengers on board per\nmile/hour of service.\no Interfaces with other on board electronic systems--\nAVL functions as an integrator of other information\nsystems on board the vehicles including APC, fare\n\nboxes, annunciation systems, signage, and signal\npreemption.\nAVL\nserves\nas\nthe\ninformation\nmanagement backbone of the other data collection\nsystems by transmitting and storing appropriate\ninformation.\no Traffic management systems--AVL facilitates the\nuse of transit vehicles as probes for various traffic\nmanagement systems including emergency deploy\nment, routine location services, and as integrators of\nintelligent highways along with other \"smart\"\ntechnologies.\no Market\nshare\nthrough\ncustomer\ninformation\nsystems--AVL is a critical ingredient in providing\ntransportation information for customers making\nappropriate modal choices in dense urban areas.\nAVL information is now linked to customer service\nsystems, kiosks, and computer services like the\nWorld Wide Web.\no Return on investment--Agencies are reporting\nreductions in operating expenses. In addition to fleet\nreduction and efficiency gains, which are used to\nincrease service frequency, using AVL data for\nanalysis purposes reduces the need for staff to\nperform schedule adherence and travel time surveys.\nEstimated savings range from $40,000 to $1.5\nmillion per survey annually (8).\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe various technologies that comprise APTS began as\nexpensive prototypes that had very little integration or cost\nbenefit when they were first introduced. They have become\nprogressively\nmore\nvaluable\nand\nless\nexpensive,\ndemonstrating tangible benefits, as they emerged out of the\ncommercialization/mass production process; however, there\nremain significant problems that need to be resolved if they\nare to become powerful management tools. The transit\nindustry needs to effectively address the issues of its\ninstitutional barriers, IT infrastructure, architectures/\nprotocols, and integrated approaches to deployment. To be\nfully effective, APTS needs to be harnessed together in\ncomprehensive and fully integrated solutions that pass\ninformation easily to management decision makers and\nreadily to customers to improve their options and reliance\non the variety of transit services available to their\ncommunities.\n\nCHAPTER SIX\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe IT environment of the U.S. transit industry is still\nsignificantly behind the standards and conditions of the\nstate of the practice of IT itself. However, since the last\nTCRP synthesis report in 1994 (1), there has been progress\non many fronts, although there remain very significant\nchallenges that need to be addressed by the industry. There\nare also significant opportunities in areas like APTS, which\nhold great promise for better management of the day-to-day\noperations and improvement in transit market share through\nreal-time customer information systems.\nThe approach taken in this synthesis report has been to\ndevelop a detailed IT standard from the surveys, interviews,\nand IT plans and place it within the context of the specific\narchitectures that would comprise an IT planning document.\nUsing this planning structure facilitates presenting the\nreport in a systematic way and provides a valuable\nframework for the planning process itself, which is a key\nmanagement tool for assessing an agency's IT environment.\nThis architectural structure is then used to compare the\ninformation obtained from the surveys, interviews, and\nindustry IT plans with the prevailing approach to IT, its\ncurrent condition, and standards.\nThe management architecture consists of the primary IT\norganizational and managerial issues of an agency. Survey\nparticipants indicated that the management architecture is\nviewed as the most crucial of the architectures in that it lays\nout the essential organizational and managerial strategies to\nfacilitate the investment and deployment of the other\narchitectures.\nThe management chapter explores the current approach\nto and structure of IT departmental organizations as they\nappear in existing plans, survey results, and interviews.\nFundamental to this approach is the movement toward\ninstituting enterprise-wide mechanisms to manage the total\nIT environment. A three-part strategy is to establish an\nagency technology investment process, an advisory\ncommittee representative of the whole organization, and an\nIT department that is organized to lead, support, maintain,\nand plan the IT deployment across all functions of the\nagency. This three-part process depends on the adoption of\na contemporary, comprehensive, enterprise-wide definition\nof IT, which not only includes all traditional computing\nplatforms and systems, but communications technology and\nother operations-specific technologies like CAD, GIS,\nITS/APTS, and SCADA systems.\nThe TAC concept creates the principal linkage between\nan agency's management, the user community, and the IT\ndepartment. It is this committee process that defines the\nstrategic criteria for IT investment and chooses specific IT\nprojects. It is the IT department that executes these\ndecisions and deploys the technology. Organizationally, IT\ndepartments have moved toward the adoption of the CTO,\nbecause so much of all technology, including transportation\ntechnology, is information driven and needs to be controlled\nthrough a single department. For the IT department to fulfill\nits deployment role effectively, it must hire professionals\nwith contemporary skills, retain them, train them, and create\nappropriate career plans for them.\nAgainst this benchmark and the detailed components of\nthe IT structural organization, the transit industry is still far\nbehind, but has made progress in the intervening 5 years\nsince the last IT synthesis report (1). More transit agencies,\nboth large and small, have begun to institute enterprise-\nwide investment processes with advisory committees.\nHowever, only a few of these agencies, in turn, have\nestablished those mechanisms in sufficiently comprehensive\nways. With actual experience and with the technology\nintegration demands of systems like APTS, these\nmanagement processes are expected to gain evergreater\ncurrency.\nMany transit agency IT departments are still organized\naround an older data processing or MIS model. Although\nthere would appear to be more IT executives who report\ndirectly to their CEOs/GMs than in our earlier assessment,\ntheir organizational model is still limited to primarily\nsupporting administrative computing, with only limited\ntechnical support for operational systems. Only a few\nagencies have moved toward the full CTO model, a few\nmore are CIOs, and most are still MIS managers or below.\nMore often than not, transit IT departments are not involved\nin the critical operations technology investments and are\nonly supporting very limited technical functionality.\nWith regards to IT staffing, issues there is a need to\nmove away from traditional programming skills toward\nprogram management skills, with increased support for\noutsourcing or contracting out for appropriate IT needs.\nBecause IT is such a competitive market place for skilled\nprofessionals, the public sector and transit must seek new\nand innovative ways to accomplish its fundamental IT\ntasks. Contracting out nonessential functions, the greater\nuse of COTS, use of turnkey vendor/consultant teams for\n\nthe\ninstallation\nof\nnew\nsystems,\nand\ncompetitive\npay/incentive programs for critical in-house staff are\napproaches being used by public sector agencies. Generally,\ntransit has been slow to adopt these approaches because\nunion rules/Section 13C regulations, political disincentives,\nand a lack of financial resources.\nAlthough many transit agencies, particularly large ones,\ncontinue to use and support old customized software for\nmany of their principal applications, there would appear to\nbe a significant movement since the last IT synthesis\nassessment (1) toward COTS products. Within the past\nseveral years, transit software vendors have developed and\nmarketed COTS packages that meet industry requirements.\nAlthough the movement toward standard industry software\npackages is more pronounced among mid-sized and small\nagencies, large agencies, as evidenced by the trend in RFPs,\nare also pursuing commercial packages, often coupled with\na vendor/consultant turnkey approach.\nMore transit agencies are pursuing BPR or business\nprocess improvement (BPI) in an attempt to align their\nbusiness practices with vendor-based and supported\nsoftware solutions. The new open architecture, client server,\nPC LAN/WAN-based technical environments make the\nacquisition of COTS packages more attractive and\ncosteffective, whether they are best of breed or single-\nvendor supported. Again, this movement is more dramatic\non the part of mid-sized and smaller agencies than on larger\nones, because they have less technical baggage and can be\nmore entrepreneurial. Large agencies have much greater\ndifficulty managing older legacy systems with the new PC\nenvironments, particularly regarding interfacing and data\nstorage, movement, and management.\nOf particular interest to transit is what can be classified\nas enabling technologies and common system support\ntechnologies. The more traditional enabling technologies\ninclude such things as bar coding, electronic forms,\nelectronic\nsignature/authorization,\nGIS,\nimaging,\nInternet/Intranet, and videoconferencing. All of these are\nused to a limited degree by large and mid-sized agencies.\nOf these, the potential impact of the Internet/Intranet and E-\ncommerce is more substantially explored in the technical\narchitecture in that it potentially affects the whole\nframework of computing.\nFinally, of the common system support technologies--\nsuch as document management, query tools, and single\nsign-on--data warehousing has the greatest single impact\non agencies that are struggling to integrate data from\ndisparate\nhardware\nand\napplications\nsources.\nData\nwarehousing/mining has begun to emerge in transit as a\nsignificant and necessary approach to support the analysis\nand decision-making requirements of the entire organi\nzation through end products like executive information\nsystems.\nThe movement toward open architecture, client server,\nPC LAN/WAN-based systems has grown dramatically\nsince the last IT survey. This technical infrastructure is the\nunderpinning of the movement toward COTS. Although\nthis movement has been slower to gain momentum with\nlarge agencies that have inherited mainframe-based legacy\nsystems and have had the added concern of making them\nY2K compatible, new RFPs would indicate the increased\npursuit of COTS packages with vendor/consultant, turnkey\nsolutions.\nThere has been an increase in the adoption of technical\nstandards to facilitate interconnectivity and integration, but\nthere still is a lack of established comprehensive standards\nthat are consistent with an enterprise-wide IT definition.\nMost transit IT departments still do not exercise sufficient\ncontrol over operations-based IT investment or deployment,\nparticularly in areas that require maximum architectural\ncontrol such as ITS/APTS.\nAs indicated in the application architecture, transit has\njust begun to take advantage of the Internet/Intranet and\nweb-enabled technologies; however, because these have\nsuch a potentially revolutionary effect on computing itself\n(hardware platforms and LAN/WAN infrastructures), E-\ncommerce needs to be considered in the context of the\noverall technical architecture. If in fact E-commerce\nbecomes the principal mechanism for acquiring goods and\nservices and the Internet/Intranet becomes the dominant\ncommunication vehicle, the effect on the technical\ninfrastructure is profound. The need for powerful PCs or\nother internal computing devices and robust LAN/WAN\ninfrastructures become potentially unnecessary or redundant\nin the world of E-commerce. John Chambers, CEO of Cisco\nSystems, said recently: \"The internet economy will have the\nsame impact on society that the industrial revolution had\n300 years ago\" (4). E-commerce is a very new concept\nbased on cutting edge technology. Because transit and the\npublic sector generally have a need to be risk adverse and\nconservative in their technology investment, no agency\nshould plunge into this volatile area, but appropriate and\nexpanding use of Internet/Intranet and the web should be\ncontinued with scrutiny of the emerging world of E-\ncommerce.\nAPTS is an area of IT that highlights both some of the\ngreatest challenges and some of the greatest opportunities\nconfronting the transit industry. On the one side it brings\nwith it all the myriad challenges we have been discussing\nthroughout all the other architectures: the difficulty of\nmanaging the whole of IT across the entire enterprise; the\nneed for organization-wide standards and architectures; the\nability to integrate disparate systems into a single man\nagement system; the ability to introduce complex technol\nogy products into environments without contemporary,\nrobust, and consistent technical infrastructures; and, finally,\n\novercoming the institutional barriers of government\nregulations, union rules, and politically motivated service.\nOn the opportunity side, APTS is the future, with very\nreal benefits for those transit agencies that institute it\nproperly. When APTS is deployed in an integrated\nmanagement approach and effectively linked to the broader\ninformation systems environment of an agency, a powerful\nand dynamic set of tools is created. Harnessed together,\nthey make up for more than the simple sum of their parts.\nIntegrated APTS represent powerful tools to manage day-\nto-day operations more effectively and efficiently and pro\nvide customers and potential customers real-time infor\nmation on the availability of service (bus, paratransit, rail,\nand their interfacing), which has the potential to improve\ntransit's modal share of the transportation market place.\nCoupled with the Internet and web-enabled technology,\nthese real-time systems can be linked to the whole trans\nportation delivery infrastructure and provide individuals\nwith decision-making tools at their fingertips.\n\nACRONYMS\nAPC\nAPTS\nAVL\nBAA\nBPR\nC/S\nCAD\nCASE\nCIO\nCOTS\nCTO\nDEC\nEIS\nELA\nG/L\nGIS\nGPS\nGUI\nHRIS\nIBM\nIT\nITS\nJCL\nLAN\nMB\nMIS\nMMIS\nMMS\nMS\nPC\nRAD\nRAM\nRDBMS\nRFP\nROCS\nSCADA\nSDLC\nSDM\nSLA\nSQL\nTAC\nTCP/IP\nTCRP\nTIP\nTQM\nTRB\nWAN\nWIP\nAutomatic Passenger Counter\nAdvanced Public Transportation Systems\nAutomatic Vehicle Location\nBusiness Area Analysis\nBusiness Process Reengineering\nClient/Server\nComputer-Aided Design\nComputer-Aided Software Engineering\nChief Information Officer\nCommercial-Off-The-Shelf\nChief Technology Officer\nDigital Equipment Corporation\nExecutive Information System\nEnterprise Level Analysis\nGeneral Ledger\nGeographic Information System\nGlobal Positioning System\nGraphical User Interface\nHuman Resources Information System\nInternational Business Machines\nInformation Technology\nIntelligent Transportation System\nJob Control Language\nLocal Area Network\nMegabyte\nManagement Information System\nMaintenance Management Information System\nMaterial Management System\nMicrosoft\nPersonal Computer\nRapid Application Development\nRandom Access Memory\nRelational Data Base Management System\nRequest for Proposal\nRail Operations Control System\nSupervisory Control and Data Acquisition\nSystem Development Life Cycle\nSystems Development Methodology\nService Level Agreement\nStructured Query Language\nTechnology Advisory Committee\nTransmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol\nTransportation Cooperative Research Program\nTechnology Investment Process\nTotal Quality Management\nTransportation Research Board\nWide Area Network\nWork in Place/Work in Process\n\nGLOSSARY\nTerm\nExplanation\nAnalog\nA transmission mode in which data are represented by a continuously varying\nelectrical signal.

Millar\nPresident\nDATE:\nJuly 1, 1999\nSUBJECT: PEER REVIEW SURVEY ON INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY\nThe APTA Research & Technology's Integrated Technology Committee (R&T ITC) is conducting a survey relative\nto the delivery of information services by your transit system. The purpose is to capture some salient metrics that can\nobjectively and convincingly provide a benchmark on what \"world class\" agencies do to provide for Information\nTechnology services.\nI'm pleased to announce that the survey will be hosted at the APTA's Web site www.apta.com for on-line\ncompletion, with as much agency specific information as possible pre-populated. I would appreciate your help by\nforwarding this request to the appropriate people within your organization and impressing upon them about the\nimportance of the survey not only to your agency, but also to the transit industry at large. We would appreciate that\nyour transit system completes the survey by July 20, 1999.\nEach individual transit property has been assigned a unique username and password to respond to the survey. Your\nagency's name and password are listed on the enclosed insert.\nAlthough the survey is quite extensive, the information ascertained can be of great value by providing statistics and\nother important information about our business practices and strategies. The R&T ITC will share the results with you\nand your peers at a session during the APTA Annual Meeting and Expo '99 in October. As an incentive for participating\nin this survey, the username and password above will enable you to later connect to the APTA web site, and receive a\ncustomized report that compares your status to the industry averages. The information would be helpful for you to\ndevelop a clearer vision. In order to protect the confidential nature of your results, individual survey responses will not\nbe published--only aggregate survey results will be made publicly available.\nShould you have any questions regarding the username and password, please contact Larry Pham.\nQuestions specific to the survey itself should be directed to Robin Cody. Your response to this survey is very\nmuch needed and would be greatly appreciated.\nThank you in advance for your assistance.\n\nAPTA - MIS/IT\nPeer Group Survey\nDESIGN SPECIFICATIONS\nOverview\no Please take a few moments and review the entire survey before beginning to gain a perspective on the total scope of the\nsurvey. You may want to acquire information or other staff to assist with your responses.\no Survey will be hosted on a secure database/web server on the World Wide Web.\no Each individual transit property will be assigned a unique user name/password with which they can respond to the\nsurvey.

Any Web site has\nits challenges, but large governmental organizations face special issues ranging from the\ntechnological to the organizational and strategic.\nThe paper looks first at the history of the site, then describes what we include currently and\nwhat we plan for the future. It then examines some of the issues that we have faced, issues that\nalmost certainly are the same ones faced by every transportation agency throughout the world\ntrying to create and maintain a useful and attractive Web site.\nFig. 1: MTA Home Page\n\nHistory\nAlthough the world-wide computer network known as the Internet has been around since the\n1960s, the so-called World Wide Web was only developed in 1990, fewer than ten years ago. The\nWeb is an Internet application allowing anyone with a computer, a modem, and an ordinary\ntelephone line to connect to--and to create--graphically rich pages anywhere in the world. Its\npower and popularity took business and government by surprise, and it is still reinventing itself\nevery few months.\nIn March 1999, Intelliquest Research2 stated that 79.4 million Americans over the age of 16\nwere online-38 percent of the entire population, a number they estimated to rise to 100 million\n(47.8%) by the year 2000. Web guru Jakob Neilsen3, who is not often wrong, predicts that there will\nbe over 200 million Web sites (not just users) by 2003. Furthermore, as the number of users grows,\nthe type of user is becoming more representative of our society: fewer have advanced degrees and\nthe average household income is not so high as it used to be. In other words, the Web is no longer\na tool for technologists and academics alone; it has become a part of everyday life.\nThe Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA), composed of New York City Transit, the\nLong Island Rail Road, Long Island Bus, Metro-North Railroad, and Bridges and Tunnels, was one\nof the first government agencies to see the potential of this new communications and business\nmedium. The first MTA inter-agency committee met on September 8, 1994, and spent much of the\nmeeting figuring out exactly what the Web actually was!\nOver the next year these enthusiasts found an old, unused Sparc2 computer at New York\nCity Transit, installed the Sun OS 4.1 operating system and CERN server, and loaded the first\nexperimental Web site on May 1, 1996. The total cost was around $20,000.\nNaturally this first site was skeletal, but the main topics included by that first committee were\nsimilar to the major topics included on the MTA site-and other\n\nFig. 2: Home page hits from 3/97-3/99\ntransportation sites--today: schedules, fares, maps, and company information. The basic\norganizational structure has remained the same, too. From the pilot project's launch date, M&CC\nhad the overall responsibility for the content and design of all material that appeared on the Web\nsite to ensure that visitors received a consistent message from all posted materials, while the bulk\nof the material was created by member agencies.\nThe number of visitors has climbed\nsteadily since those early days. Today the\nsite, composed of around 3,000 pages,\nattracts around 14,000 visitors on a weekday,\nand 9,000 on a Saturday or Sunday, with a\nspike of 20,000 the day before Thanksgiving.\nBy late 1997, it was clear that the pilot\nnature of the project had to end: too much\ninformation was on line to allow people to maintain in their spare time, let alone to create anything\nnew. Similarly it was becoming increasingly difficult to monitor the information being posted, and\nthe site began to lose its feeling of coherence and unity. In the middle of 1998, a new hardware\nsystem4 was implemented, and M&CC hired a new Webmaster and coder/programmer. At the\nOctober 1998 APTA Conference we presented the new \"MTA Online,\" a complete redesign of the\nsite with many new features and a simplified and easy to follow navigation system.\nThe Current Site and Future Plans\nContent\nThe most popular pages on the MTA site are the maps. Since the Web cannot yet compete\nwith the precision, beauty, and portability of printed maps, we aimed to provide a different\nservice to our customers by using the Web's interactivity.\n\nOur subway and train maps\nhave been specially\ndesigned to be as small as\npossible to make them load\nfaster, and are hyperlinked\nto stations, schedules, fares,\nand connections, and from\nthem to the rest of the site.\nBus maps, because of their\nsize and detail, were more\ndifficult to deal with. We\nsolved the problem by\nproviding the maps in a PDF\nformat that allows the user to increase or decrease the size.\nSchedules and fares are the second most visited pages. With minor changes, we are\nstill using the original design displaying the Long Island Rail Road schedules and fares. The\nlook and feel of these has proven so popular that we are looking to display Metro-North's\nschedules and fares in the same format. However, they were designed to display in frames,\nvery popular at the time though going out of\nFig. 4: LIRR schedule page for Montauk\nfavor today, and we are looking for\nalternatives. Interestingly, we need to modify\nthe frames to run correctly and print on kiosks\nprovided throughout New York by a third-\nparty vendor.\nNot only are schedules the most visited areas\nof the site, they also require the most\nextensive maintenance effort. The\nFig.3: Maps. Top\nto bottom, parts of\nsubway, bus,\nLong\nIsland\nRail\nRoad.\n\noriginal schedules were produced in versions of programs that no longer exist. We are\nplanning to implement a new system to update our schedules using Cold Fusion linked to a\nserver database, probably Oracle.\nOne of the first tasks for the new Webmaster was to set up an\nautomatic system for emergency announcements at any time day or\nnight. Adding text to a specified empty information file on the\ndevelopment server triggers a series of events. Flashing symbols\nlinking directly to the information page appear on the main MTA home\npage as well as the individual agency home page and remain until the\nagency removes the text from the information page. The system\nworked well during an incident on the Metro-North Railroad's system\nin late 1998. Metro-North staff were able to update information on a\nminute-by-minute basis from the incident room, and have it appear\nimmediately on the Web pages. Scheduled updates to service changes are posted on a\nregular basis.\nA system as massive as the Metropolitan Transportation Authority network needs to\ninform customers about new initiatives, and our biggest to date has been MetroCard. The site\nprovides extensive information, from a basic description of how to use the card to current lists\nof out-of-system vendors and special offers\nFig. 6: E-ZPass application form\nand new plans. We expect the new joint\nproject with CitySearch, described below\nunder \"New Initiatives,\" to create a huge\nnumber of satisfied customers. We are also\nthe major partner in E-ZPass, the electronic\ntoll collection system that makes toll paying\nfaster and more convenient throughout\nNew York state\nFig. 5: In an\nemergency, the\nicon above\nflashes\nautomatically on\nthe home page.\n\nand surrounding states. Travelers can order and update their accounts by using the online\nform. We also provide the public with information about planning surveys and get online input\nfrom interested parties.\nThe MTA is a playing a vital role in the current renaissance\nof New York City as a tourist magnet, and we plan to focus on\nincreasing the number of pages devoted to material that will\nattract visitors from all over the United States and the rest of the\nworld. Currently we take our visitors on a guided tour to see the\nart in many of our stations, both in the Transit system as well as\nat Long Island Rail Road and Metro-North Railroad stations.\nVisitors can also listen to the sounds of performers in the subway\nstations. Recently the Transit Museum expanded its mandate to\ninclude artifacts and history from all MTA agencies as well as just the subways and buses of\nNew York City, and we will be taking visitors on a guided, virtual-reality tour.\nAs well as providing a service, the MTA is a business, and from its first days the Web\nsite has included information for its investors and suppliers. We provide the latest progress\nreport to investors, a complete Annual Report as well as all information about all financial\nofferings. A multi-agency task force\nFig. 8: 1998 comprehensive financial report\ncomposed of procurement professionals\nfrom all five agencies (those who\npurchase everything from office supplies\nto subway trains for the MTA) met\nthroughout 1998 to come up with a\ndesign for a Web presence that would\nwork for them all. This has now been\nimplemented, with links to\nFig. 7: A wav file transmits\nthe golden tones of Roy\nCampbell's horn as part of\nthe Arts for Transit pages.\n\nprocurement pages maintained by all the agencies as well as information on capital projects\npublished in \"Eye on the Future.\"\nWhile most of the agencies participate, New York City Transit provides an enormous\namount of information on active purchasing and contract solicitations as well as surplus\nsales using cgi technology to create up-to-date listings from existing databases. Transit is\ncurrently investigating the best way to link official bid documents to an online bidders' list that\nwould allow relevant documents to reach interested bidders automatically over the Internet.\nThe first Extranet system allows vendors and other interested parties to keep abreast of\ndevelopments in the new subway car initiative by accessing a hidden directory with a\npassword.\nNew Initiatives\nThe MTA is partnering with two outside organizations on very different projects that, while\nno one can predict the exact figures, promise to at least double the number of visitors to our\nsite.\nThe nationwide city guide site,\nCitySearch, is hosting an application\nallowing customers to purchase MetroCard\nonline. CitySearch handles all payments\nand mails the cards directly to customers.\nThe prominent links between the two sites\ncan only increase traffic enormously.\nThe other major new initiative is the federally funded TRIPS application, coordinated by\nTRANSCOM, the public-private agency that coordinates all minute-by-minute incident and\nconstruction reporting in the area. The system will allow the visitor to enter a street address\nand find the quickest and most accurate\nFig. 9: Buy MetroCard online\n\npublic transportation (private and public bus, subway, train) route to another street address\nanywhere in New York, New Jersey or Connecticut. With over 1,000 routes spanning 28\ncounties and a population of 16 million people, MTA Online visitors will have access to\ninformation that was never available before.\nHardware\nThe MTA was determined to provide a system that\nwould be adequate for current needs and at least five\nyears of growth (with built-in upgrades). This system4\nwas installed in 1998, and we are confident that this\nconfiguration will handle any amount of traffic coming\nover the TI line-and then more.\nOrganizational Structure\nLike all Web sites, MTA Online is a collaboration\nbetween the communications and technology departments, both at headquarters and at the\nindividual agencies. At the agencies the communications departments determine what\ncontent should be included, and the technology departments create the pages. Full-time staff\nat each agency ranges from half-a-person to five people with the Webmaster and assistant at\nheadquarters. Files are sent via FTP to the development server behind the firewall where\nthey can be tested before uploading to\nFig. 11: The New York Transit Museum\nproduction. The MTA Webmaster reviews all\ncontent and is the only person who posts\nmaterial to the production server--with the\nexception of the emergency situations\ndescribed above. MTA headquarters produces\nits own material too. It is directly responsible for\nthe Arts for Transit and Transit Museum\nsections of the site.\nFig. 10: System administrator\nPierre Bernard runs the\nservers.\n\nIssues\nSome of the issues arising from the creation and maintenance of a large Web site arise because of\nthe nature of corporate communications, some are the result of the special needs of transportation\nWeb sites, while many are generated by the fast-changing nature of this new communication\nmedium.\nContent control versus creative freedom\nFinding a balance between the need for a site that can convey an overall corporate\nmessage and the need to encourage the content creators is a continuing challenge.\nIn 1998, the site was redesigned with an overall navigational system that clearly\nlets the visitor know they are in one place, no matter which agency is on the screen.\nAt the same time, the individual\nagencies are responsible for the\nconception, creation and\nmaintenance of their own material,\nand they are free within the limits of\nthe overall design and guidelines to\nexperiment. As with all printed\nmaterials produced by the MTA,\nM&CC has the final approval.\nOrganizationally, the Webmasters at the different agencies meet on a regular basis\nto bring up technical and stylistic issues. When necessary the content creators from the\ncorporate communications groups of the agencies are invited, and all issues concerning\nnew material are now resolved between the corporate communications groups of the\nagencies and MTA C&CC.\nFig. 12: NYC Transit's Facts & Figures\n\nFig. 13: NYC Transit's procument pages use cgi to\nhandle the data.\nHow do the communications departments interact with the information systems\ndepartments?\nNo matter how skilled a writer, he or she\nstill depends on printing technology to\ndisseminate the message. A Web site is\neven more dependent on technology.\nWebmasters frequently find that they may\nspend more time during the day talking to\nthe system administrator than they may\nthe content creators. The MTA Web site is\nso successful because of the close\nworking relationship between the different\ndepartments. Some of the agencies have developed more advanced applications than\nothers, and New York City Transit is currently writing an application to allow vendors to take\nadvantage of its Exchange server. This will be hosted at Transit, but linked from the Internet\nserver at headquarters.\nWhich development software?\nWe have been looking at systemwide software, and have not yet found one that meets our\nneeds. Until very recently, each agency has been using whatever they started with to develop\ntheir pages. Some were using FrontPage, others HotDog and HomeSite, while still others\nfavored NotePad. We are moving to DreamWeaver as a standard, since this program\nappears to address the design and technical needs of the latest versions of HTML, and all\nagencies will be using it soon. All have been trained in the program.\nWhich version of the browser?\nCurrently the standard for our pages is that they be viewable in Netscape 3 and 4 and\nInternet Explorer 3 and 4. This seemed a reasonable compromise between making every\npage read perfectly in Lynx and so-called \"bleeding-edge\" (as\n\nopposed to cutting-edge) technology. It is not a perfect solution, but one we feel is\nappropriate for a government agency. With the release of Internet Explorer 5 in March 1999,\nwe are planning to update our requirements to Internet 4 and Netscape 4 in early 2000. We\nwill still maintain alternate pages for viewing in version 3.\nThis will not only allow us to achieve more interesting effects on the site, but will make it\neasier to standardize fonts. The Cascading Style Sheet technology has the further advantage\nof producing code that can be translated easily by equipment for the blind. Public agencies\nalmost certainly will be the first Web sites to be required to adhere to the standards of the\nAmericans with Disabilities Act, and we need to prepare. Each agency is responsible for its\nown training schedule, but the MTA set up training in the Web creation software,\nDreamweaver.\nHow do you create materials specifically tailored for the Web?\nEarly Web sites simply took existing\nbrochures and dropped them on the Web\nsite. Usability sites have shown that people\nsimply do not read a computer screen in the\nsame way they read a printed book or report.\nThey scan pages, looking always for the next\nlink down. It is essential to make it easy to\nfind the material they are looking for. We\nredesign brochure material when we can, but\nalso make use of the Adobe Acrobat\ntechnology for large documents, such as the\nAnnual Report. The new navigation system, and increased number of cross-links throughout\nthe site make it easier for users to know where they are.\nFig. 14: The \"What's New\" page changes as often\nas possible.\n\nFig. 15: Each subway line page has current\ninformation, maps, schedules, and links to points of\ninterest.\nKeeping the site current\nEach week we produce a report for all the agencies in LinkBot, a program that tracks\ninternal and external links as well as orphans--files that are no longer linked to from any\nother file.\nAgencies are responsible for updating\ntheir own sites. Because the MTA is so\nlarge, agencies generate their own new\ncontent. And since the Web is a function of\nM&CC, the Webmaster is aware of new\npolicies and innovations at the MTA, and\ncan also suggest new material to the\nagencies for the site.\nConclusion\nWe know from our own experience, and the experience of other businesses, that new initiatives\nlike the ones described in this paper coupled with cheaper computers will keep pushing the\nnumbers of users upwards. And that is a real challenge to government agencies, under\nconstant pressure to reduce not to increase costs. We have found that the cooperative\napproach between the agencies with the Webmaster at headquarters works best.\nSays Jakob Neilsen in his advice to Web managers: \"The Web should be considered as\none of the most important determinants for the way you will do business in the future.... [It] has\nbeen hyped to such an extent that people overestimate what it can do the next year or two....\nBut please don't underestimate what will happen once we reach the goal of 'everyone,\neverywhere; connected.' The impact of networks grows by at least the square of the number of\nconnections, and the true value of the Web will only be seen after extensive business process\nreengineering.\"\n\n1 David Siegel \"Secrets of Successful Web Sites,\" Hayden Books, 1997\n2 Intelliquest Research (http://www.intelliquest.com)\n3 Jacob Neilsen is widely considered to be the most knowledgeable expert on Web usability.

AATA\nserves over four million passengers per year with 27 bus\nroutes and paratransit service for seniors and people with\ndisabilities in Ann Arbor, Ypsilanti, and adjacent areas.\nServices are offered 24 hours a day, seven days a week in\nAnn Arbor. Though national public transit ridership rates\nare declining, AATA continues to buck the national trend\nby documenting an increase in ridership on the average of 8\npercent each year.\nThe AOS project began in the fall of 1996, when the\nprimp contract for development and implementation was\nawarded to Rockwell. Ninety percent of AOS funding is\nprovided by Federal and State grants.\nAOS\nAdvanced Communications\nEach AATA bus has an 800 MHz radio and onboard\ncomputer. The system minimizes voice transmissions by\nproviding data messages that summarize vehicle status,\noperating condition, and location. During routine operation,\nthe vehicle sends this information over a data channel.\nWhen drivers or dispatchers request voice communication,\nthe radio switches to a voice channel.\nDrivers use a graphical Mobile Display Terminal\n(MDT) to interact with the radio; to call their own transfers;\nto play onboard announcements; to receive and send text\nmessages; to review their schedules and to receive\ncontinuous on-time performance notices.\nParatransit drivers receive their entire schedules and\nmark their arrival and departure times with date, time and\nlocation information as well as all the features above.\nAutomatic Vehicle Location\nEach bus determines its location using global positioning\nsatellite (GPS) technology. Differential corrections are\nbroadcast to the vehicles so they can calculate their\nlocations, within one or two meters. The MDT stores\ncomplete route schedules on an insertable memory card.\nThe GPS system provides accurate time to the vehicles.\nBuses compare scheduled times and locations with actual\nlocations and determine whether they are on time. If a bus\ndetermines that it is running late, the driver is advised, and\nif necessary, the onboard computer notifies the Operation\nCenter. The AVL also triggers the outside destination\nannouncement and the internal next stop signs and\nannouncement. It also integrates location data with fare\ncollection, passenger counters and electronic controlled\nengine data.\nNew runs and routes can be inserted or removed from\nthe scheduling system at any time. Entire new routes or\nschedule changes can be easily constructed. Through the\nuse of headway displays and schedule adherence reporting,\ndispatchers can manage the system and assist drivers by\ninserting overload vehicles in the system or recommending\nre-routing options. All changes to the route and schedule\ndatabase are noted and automatically updated.\nEmergency System\nOnboard the vehicle, the driver has an onboard emergency\nsystem. When encountering a life-threatening situation, the\ndriver covertly alerts the dispatcher who immediately notes\nthe vehicle's location on the system's center map and dials\nthe appropriate agency. The system also allows the\ndispatcher to open up a central RA system inside the\nvehicle to monitor the situation. The system also supports\nresponsive\nreporting\nof\nroutine,\nnon-life-threatening\nemergencies, such as passenger inconvenience.\nEn Route Information\nInside the bus, next stop announcements, date, time and\nroute are given to passengers utilizing the onboard P.A.\nsystem and a 2 line LED display. The driver also has the\nability to trigger timed and period announcements for\nspecial events that can be made to support the system.\nOutside the bus, the current route information is\nannounced to waiting passengers, and the destination signs\nare changed based upon the location. Creation of digital\nannouncements is done locally using a P.C. based recording\nstation. Updates can be copied right on the vehicle.\nGeographic Information System\nThe Rockwell MapMasterTM is a portable system that\nallows you to log the geographic locations of bus stops and\n\nroutes. This data can be imported to the route generator GIS\nsystem. This system generates transit schedules that include\ntime points, announcement points, transfer points and bus\nstops on a route-by-route basis.\nComputer-Assisted Transfer Management\nUsing the TransitMasterTM system, drivers send and receive\nall transfer requests that they encounter in the next several\nminutes. Routes are listed in the order that they will occur.\nThe dispatch computer calculates whether requested\ntransfers are possible and informs the driver on the\nTransitMasterTM display. If a transfer is accepted, the\ndispatch computer sends a message to the bus advising the\ndriver to wait for the transfer.\nADA Paratransit\nReservations,\nscheduling,\nflexible\nintegration\nwith\nfixedroute, and after-trip information for paratransit\nvehicles utilizes Trapeze software. All of these elements are\nbased on real-time information generated with the Rockwell\nTransitMasterTM software.\nCustomer Information\nAll real-time operational data is stored in an open format\nthat allows access for external sources. Color graphic\narrival and departure screens are installed at the downtown\ntransit center. The infrastructure is in place to integrate the\nreal-time operational data with the AATA web site and\npublic-access cable television channels during peak service\ntimes.\nVehicle Component Monitoring\nReports from the electronic controlled engine monitoring\nthe system are integrated to the onboard computer. Out-of\ntolerance conditions such as oil pressure and temperature\nare reported in real time to the onboard computer, the\nOperations Center and the Maintenance Department. Also a\ncontinuous three minutes of data is monitored, and then a\ndriver activates an emergency, the engine information is\nsaved.\nVideo Surveillance\nA three-camera video surveillance system enhances safety\non AATA's New Flyer buses. The system records videotape\nfor playback. One of the cameras also records audio. A two-\ncamera digital system is installed on each ELF El Dorado\nvehicle, which has a P.C. based playback system to insert\nthe hard drive from the digital camera. AATA has also\ndiscovered dramatic improvements in the cleanliness of the\nvehicles attributed to the video surveillance system.\nAutomated Passenger Counters\nA sample of each vehicle type in the fleet will be equipped\nwith integrated Automatic Passenger Counting system. This\nsystem will count passengers as they board and leave the\nbus. This information will be used for future route\ndevelopment, assessment of ridership patterns, and\ndevelopment of new service concepts.\nFare Collection\nDrivers can register all fare transactions via the MDT by\nintegrating the current keypad from the electronic farebox.\nFare collection data will be stored in a central database.\n\nAPPENDIX H\nStatus of NYC Transit Intelligent Transportation Systems Program\nStatus of NYC Transit Intelligent Transportation Systems Program\nby\nIsaac K.

TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH BOARD is a unit of the National Research\nCouncil, a private, nonprofit institution that provides independent advice on scientific and\ntechnical issues under a congressional charter. The Research Council is the principal\noperating arm of the National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of\nEngineering.\nThe mission of the Transportation Research Board is to promote innovation and progress\nin transportation by stimulating and conducting research, facilitating the dissemination of\ninformation, and encouraging the implementation of research findings. The Board's varied\nactivities annually draw on approximately 4,000 engineers, scientists, and other transportation\nresearchers and practitioners from the public and private sectors and academia, all of whom\ncontribute their expertise in the public interest. The program is supported by state\ntransportation departments, federal agencies including the component administrations of the\nU.S. Department of Transportation, and other organizations and individuals interested in the\ndevelopment of transportation.\nThe National Academy of Sciences is a nonprofit, self-perpetuating society of\ndistinguished scholars engaged in scientific and engineering research, dedicated to the\nfurtherance of science and technology and to their use for the general welfare. Upon the\nauthority of the charter granted to it by the Congress in 1863, the Academy has a mandate that\nrequires it to advise the federal government on scientific and technical matters. Dr. Bruce\nAlberts is president of the National Academy of Sciences.\nThe National Academy of Engineering was established in 1964, under the charter of the\nNational Academy of Sciences, as a parallel organization of outstanding engineers. It is\nautonomous in its administration and in the selection of its members, sharing with the\nNational Academy of Sciences the responsibility for advising the federal government. The\nNational Academy of Engineering also sponsors engineering programs aimed at meeting\nnational needs, encouraging education and research, and recognizes the superior achievements\nof engineers. Dr. William A. Wulf is president of the National Academy of Engineering.\nThe Institute of Medicine was established in 1970 by the National Academy of Sciences to\nsecure the services of eminent members of appropriate professions in the examination of\npolicy matters pertaining to the health of the public. The Institute acts under the responsibility\ngiven to the National Academy of Sciences, by its congressional charter to be an adviser to\nthe federal government and, upon its own initiative, to identify issues of medical care,\nresearch, and education. Dr. Kenneth I. Shine is president of the Institute of Medicine.\nThe National Research Council was organized by the National Academy of Sciences in\n1916 to associate the broad community of science and technology with the Academy's\npurposes of furthering knowledge and advising the federal government. Functioning in\naccordance with general policies determined by the Academy, the Council has become the\nprincipal operating agency of both the National Academy of Sciences and the National\nAcademy of Engineering in providing services to the government, the public, and the\nscientific and engineering communities. The Council is administered jointly by both\nAcademies and the Institute of Medicine. Dr. Bruce Alberts and Dr. William A. Wulf are\nchairman and vice chairman, respectively, of the National Research Council."
