  "syllabus_content": "Course Meeting Times\n\nLectures: 1 session / week, 3 hours / session\n\nPrerequisites\n\nPermission of instructor; undergraduates may register for this subject provided they are ready to participate with the intensity expected for a grade H-level\nsubject.\n\nCourse Overview\n\nOne of the most important skills you can learn at Sloan is how to effectively negotiate. Negotiations occur both in our professional and personal lives, from complex contracts to daily interactions. The flattening of organizations means we are all increasingly finding ourselves negotiating with peers, managers, subordinates, collaborators, clients, and partners. Although we negotiate all the time, most of us have not systematically learned and practiced effective negotiation strategies.\n\nNegotiating is a skill that can be learned and improved. But, like playing tennis or chess, it requires know-how and\npractice\n. Learning to become an effective negotiator is not predominantly a matter of listening to lectures, but of actively participating in negotiation simulations that give you a chance to experience and experiment with different negotiation strategies and tools. This course provides multiple opportunities to practice your negotiating skills, to correct many mistakes that naive negotiators tend to commit, reflect upon your experiences, and increase your effectiveness. The essence of this course can be distilled to: Practice, Reflect, Analyze, and Practice again.\n\nGoals and Learning Objectives\n\nAfter taking this course you will be able to:\n\nGarner your fair share of what is negotiated\n\nRecognize opportunities to create value that others might overlook\n\nStrategically analyze negotiation situations and avoid common mistakes\n\nBuild lasting working relationships with negotiation counterparts\n\nHandle difficult conversations in business and life\n\nReflect and learn from your experiences\n\nCourse Materials\n\nBooks\n\nFisher, Roger, William Ury, and Bruce Patton.\nGetting to Yes: Negotiating Agreement Without Giving In\n. Penguin Books, 1991. ISBN: 9780140065343.\n\nFisher, Roger, and Daniel Shapiro.\nBeyond Reason: Using Emotions as You Negotiate.\nPenguin Books, 2006. ISBN: 9780143037781.\n\nRequirements\n\nWeekly Readings\n\nPlease read the articles or chapters assigned to each week ahead of class.\n\nThe list and sequence of weekly readings may change during the course of the semester depending on the way the course unfolds. In case of additional readings, these will be distributed to you in class at least one week in advance.\n\nWeekly Simulations\n\nIn this course learning mostly occurs not by reading and talking but by doing and experiencing. Because of the importance of practice to negotiations, class sessions will involve at least one negotiation simulation.\n\nFor some simulations you will be asked to prepare your role in advance of class. It is\nextremely\nimportant for you to prepare carefully. Many of the simulations require close reading of background information and confidential instructions for each role. To avoid wasting your and your bargaining counterparts' time,\nplease come fully prepared to class\n.\n\nTo make the simulations meaningful learning experiences\nDo Not\nshare or discuss your confidential instructions with the counter party.\n\nReflective Memos\n\nReflecting critically on one's own choices and actions is crucial for strengthening one's negotiation skills. You are required to write 5 one-page single spaced memos over the semester. There will be:\n\n3 Simulation Memos:\nSelect a particular negotiation simulation performed in class in which you participated.\n\n1 Real Life Memo:\nAnalyze a \"real life\" negotiation that you experience outside the classroom.\n\nGrand Finale Memo:\nReflect back on what you've learned in the course of the semester, how your negotiation style has changed, and what you still want to work on going forward.\n\nGroup Paper and Proposed Presentation\n\nAfter forming a team with colleagues, you will collectively research and write a 7-10 page paper investigating a real-world conflict situation of your own choosing. Together with the paper, each team will create a simulation or exercise that illustrates the key lesson learned from your paper. The groups with the most promising presentation proposals will have an opportunity to takeover part of Class 12 and run the proposed exercise.\n\nClass Participation\n\nActive participation is a key ingredient to learning in this class. Even if you do not typically speak in class, I urge you to use this class as a safe space to experiment with sharing your thoughts. We will be grading your class participation. We particularly encourage you to make comments that have one or more of the following attributes:\n\nOffer an original and relevant perspective on the issue.\n\nMove the analysis forward by building on previous contributions.\n\nApply concepts to concrete situations.\n\n(Note: Once you have spoken in a given class session please pause before raising your hand again so that other students have a chance to participate. If after your pause no new hands are raised, feel free to raise yours.)\n\nAttendance\n\nStudents taking this course are expected to regularly attend every class, to arrive (and leave) on time, and to be well prepared for all simulations and in-class exercises. Your own learning and that of your classmates depends on your attendance and timely arrival. Because simulations partners are sometimes assigned in advance, absences can have a significant negative impact on your assigned negotiation partner. Likewise, since we often conduct simulations at the beginning of class, a late arrival causes significant disruption to the class. Therefore, the attendance policy in 15.665 is strict: no absences are allowed. If you believe you have a truly exceptional circumstance that requires your absence, you must notify your TA\nat least\n48 hours prior to class. If you have an exceptional circumstance and provide 48 hours advanced notice to your TA you will not be penalized for the first absence. However,\nany further absences\n, will have a negative impact on your participation and attendance grade, and such negative impact will be greater if you not provide 48 hours advance notification to your TA.\n\nFreebie Challenge\n\nIn the spirit of experimentation and fun, I challenge those of you who want to push your negotiation skills to try to negotiate free food, drinks or other \"freebies\" for the entire class. Approach restaurant owners or other vendors, and negotiate on behalf of the class. (In the past some students have convinced local restaurants to provide free food as a marketing strategy). Any food or other freebies will be shared in the last session. While this exercise is purely voluntary, booty that comes with a good negotiation story will enhance your class \"participation\" grade.\n\nGrading Breakdown\n\nACTIVITIES\n\nPERCENTAGES\n\n5 Reflective memos (8% each)\n\n40% of final grade\n\nGroup paper and presentation proposal\n\n30% of final grade\n\nClass attendance and participation\n\n30% of final grade\n\nConfidentiality\n\nPrivacy:\nA sense of openness and trust among participants will increase our ability to share with and learn from one another. We want the class to be a safe place to try out new styles of negotiating and new ways of thinking. Therefore, we ask that you exercise higher than normal discretion in talking about the experiences, behavior, or comments of others. This is particularly important when you are speaking to those outside of our course. We will do the same.\n\nIntegrity of the Negotiation Simulations:\nIn many of the exercises this semester, you will be given confidential instructions. Please do\nnot\nshare these instructions with participants who have different roles in the exercise. We will often provide opportunity after the completion of an exercise to share these instructions with those on the other side and to reflect on the experience together. Additionally, please refrain from talking about the details or structure of the negotiation exercises with people outside of the course. To invent and refine a case is a laborious task, sometimes taking several years. If either the structure of a case (i.e., its basic challenge) or the substantive facts of one or both sides become widely known, the case would be of little use to future participants.",

It is not\neffective to respond with empathy. Instead, match their\npower first, then attempt to turn dynamics around.\nIndicate your capacity to be equally angry, to assert your\nrights, or to make an extreme opening demand\nIndicating capacity to reciprocate is different from\nreciprocating\nSuggest you prefer to refrain from a shouting match in favor\nof finding mutually beneficial solutions.\n\"We can continue shouting and blaming or we can move\nforward to finding a solution that meets our interests\"\n\nHOW RESPOND TO\nREAL ANGER?\nIf the anger is real try to listen and understand (more on\nthis later)\nHow can you tell if real or tactical?\nTactical anger is used in early stages to unhinge, real anger\nis gradual and builds up (e.g., because one feels not listened\nto)\nReal anger subsides when you allow venting, listen and\nacknowledge where they are coming from\nReal anger escalates if you attempt a power-matching\nstrategy\nResearch the reputation of your counterparty\nIs the counterparty a lawyer?\n\nDIFFICULT TACTICS\nEXAMPLES:\nIntimidation/Anger\nExtreme opening positions (most common)\nTake it or leave it offers\nGood cop/Bad cop\nThe Nibble\nChicken\n\nDEALING WITH DIFFICULT\nTACTICS\nHOW RESPOND? Avoid: reciprocating, surrendering or\nquitting. Instead change the game.\nStrategy #1: REFRAME by focusing on:\nInterests.

I reached\nout to our mutual friend who provided me insight about\ntheir extra-curricular activities, their family status (he\nhad just had a baby).
