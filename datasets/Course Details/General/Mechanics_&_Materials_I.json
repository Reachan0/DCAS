  "course_description": "This course provides an introduction to the mechanics of solids with applications to science and engineering. We emphasize the three essential features of all mechanics analyses, namely: (a) the geometry of the motion and/or deformation of the structure, and conditions of geometric fit, (b) the forces on and within structures and assemblages; and (c) the physical aspects of the structural system (including material properties) which quantify relations between the forces and motions/deformation.",

  "syllabus_content": "Course Meeting Times\n\nLectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session\n\nRecitations: 1 session / week, 1.5 hours / session\n\nCourse Structure\n\nLectures\n\nEach week there will be two lectures. Attendance at lectures is mandatory.\n\nRecitations\n\nEach week, students will meet for a 1.5-hour recitation section consisting of 10 - 20 students. Attendance during these sessions is\nmandatory\n. The recitation sections will consist of additional discussion of course material, examples and experiments. These sections serve three main purposes: (1) they provide a more informal opportunity to explore issues and ask questions about lectures, texts, or previously assigned material which requires clarification; (2) example problems will be presented and discussed, and (3) they provide opportunities to further explore course topics with experiments.\n\nPrerequisites and Corequisites\n\nPrerequisites:\n\n8.01 Physics I: Classical Mechanics\n\n18.02 Multivariable Calculus\n\nCorequisites:\n\n18.03 Differential Equations\n\nPrerequisites and Corequisites are strictly enforced.\n\nTexts\n\nRequired\n\nHibbeler, R.

Lardner.\nAn Introduction to the Mechanics of Solids\n. 2nd ed. New York, NY: McGraw Hill, 1979. ISBN: 9780070662308.\n\nAssignments\n\nProblem sets will typically be handed out on Wednesdays and due the following Wednesday. To receive credit, problem sets must be handed in at the beginning of class on the due date. Problem sets will not necessarily be assigned every week because of tests, holidays, etc.\nLate problem sets will not be accepted. The lowest problem set grade will be dropped\n.\n\nYou are welcome, and encouraged, to work on the assignment problems with fellow students. A good way to learn the material is in small study groups. Such groups work best if members have attempted the problems individually before meeting as a group. Of course, the assignment solution that you turn in should reflect your own understanding, and not that of your fellow students. In other words, do not copy directly from other students. If it is obvious that such direct copying has occurred, we will disallow that homework.\n\nTests\n\nThere will be two one and one-half hour quizzes and a three-hour final exam. These will be closed book. Two pages of notes (one-sided) are permitted for each quiz, four pages for the final.\n\nTutorials\n\nThe TAs will hold a tutorial session one or two days before each quiz. Details will be announced prior to each tutorial.\n\nGrading\n\nACTIVITIES\n\nPERCENTAGES\n\nHomework\n\n13%\n\nQuiz 1\n\n15%\n\nQuiz 2\n\n25%\n\nRecitations\n\n12%\n\nFinal Exam\n\n35%\n\nCalendar\n\nLEC #\n\nTOPICS\n\nKEY DATES\n\nPart 1: Statics - Elements of Equilibrium\n\nCourse Outline, Review of Forces and Moments, Introduction to Equilibrium\n\nForces, Moments, Equilibrium\n\nApplying the Equations of Equilibrium, Planar Trusses\n\nFriction\n\nPart 2: Forces and Moments Transmitted by Slender Members\n\nShear Force and Bending Moment Diagrams\n\nProblem set 1 due\n\nShear Force and Bending Moment Diagrams (cont.)\n\nProblem set 2 due\n\nPart 3: Mechanics of Deformable Bodies - Introduction\n\nForce-deformation Relationships and Static Indeterminacy\n\nFinishing up Static Indeterminacy; Uniaxial Loading and Material Properties\n\nProblem set 3 due\n\nTrusses and Their Deformations\n\nProblem set 4 due\n\nStatically Determinate and Indeterminate Trusses\n\nProblem set 5 due\n\nQuiz 1\n\nPart 4: Force-Stress-Equilibrium\n\nMultiaxial Stress\n\nMultiaxial Stress and Strain\n\nPart 5: Displacement - Strain\n\nMultiaxial Strain and Multiaxial Stress-strain Relationships\n\nPart 6: Linear Elasticity - Material Behavior\n\nStress-strain-temperature Relationships and Thin-walled Pressure Vessels\n\nProblem set 6 due\n\nStress Transformations and Principal Stress\n\nStress and Strain Transformations\n\nProblem set 7 due\n\nFailure of Materials and Examples\n\nProblem set 8 due\n\nQuiz 2\n\nPart 7: Bending: Stress and Strains; Deflections\n\nPure Bending\n\nMoment-curvature Relationship\n\nProblem set 9 due\n\nBeam Deflection\n\nSymmetry, Superposition, and Statically Indeterminate Beams\n\nProblem set 10 due\n\nPart 8: Torsion; Energy Methods\n\nTorsion and Twisting\n\nTorsion Examples\n\nProblem set 11 due\n\nEnergy Methods\n\nExamples",

You also have a saw that you can\nuse to cut the ends of the pieces of wood at any angle that you like prior to gluing. At what angle\nθ should you cut the wood faces if you want the resulting beam to be able to withstand the\nlargest possible tensile load? (For the purposes of this problem, you cannot cut any dove tails or\nother fancy shapes into the faces of the wood to get a stronger connection.)\n\nθ\nF\nF\n\nProblem 4: You decided to measure the pressure inside a soda\ncan by sticking a strain gauge along the axial direction when it is\nsealed, popping the can open to release the pressure, and using the\nstrain gauge to measure the resulting strain (as compared to when\nthe soda can was sealed). However, your hands were shaky, and\nyou didn't quite get the strain gauge to line up along the axial\ndirection - you were instead off by an angle of φ from the axial\ndirection. If your soda can has a radius R, wall thickness t,\nYoung's modulus E, and Poisson ratio ν, derive an equation for p\nin terms of the given parameters, the angle φ, and your measured\nstrain.\nx\nφ\nstrain\ngauge\ndirection"
