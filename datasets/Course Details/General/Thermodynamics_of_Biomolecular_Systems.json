  "syllabus_content": "Course Meeting Times\n\nLectures: 3 sessions / week, 1 hour / session\n\nRecitations: 2 sessions / week, 1 hour / session\n\nAbout the Course\n\n20.110/2.772 was first taught in 2002 with the aim of providing a foundation in the thermodynamic principles used to describe biomolecular behavior and interactions such as those that lead to assembly of cell membranes, binding of growth factors to cells, annealing of cDNA sequences to oligonucleotides on microarray chips, and separation of complex mixtures of biomolecules for atomic analysis. Many of these problems, as well as related problems in nanotechnology and polymer science, are illuminated by a statistical thermodynamics approach. As the course evolved to become the foundational thermodynamics subject for the Biological Engineering S. B. degree and for many students in Biology, we found that our original syllabus did not include the appropriate treatment of classical thermodynamics required to solve practical problems in biochemical thermodynamics. Further, it became clear that a revision of the 20.110/2.772 syllabus to begin with classical thermodynamics provide a fortuitous overlap with parts of the\n5.60\nsyllabus. Chemistry, Mechanical Engineering, and Biological Engineering thus developed a common syllabus for the first half of the term, with each subject then diverging into significantly different emphases in the latter part of the term (5.60 concludes with chemical kinetics, and 20.110/2.772 with biomolecular structure and interactions). A pilot version of the combined syllabus was taught in Spring 2005 by Professors Silbey, Griffith, and Irvine as 20.110/2.772, and the current syllabus is slightly revised from the pilot.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThe material for first half of 20.110/2.772 that overlaps with 5.60 has evolved over a period of many years, and therefore several faculty members have contributed to the development of the course contents.

Identifying boundary conditions.\n\nClassify the thermodynamic systems described below as open, closed, or isolated:\na. The system is a suspension of cells in culture media contained in a covered plastic Petri\ndish; the surroundings: the dish is sitting within an incubator which maintains a constant\ntemperature of 37°C and provides CO2 gas to the incubator chamber at a constant level\nof 5 volume %.\nb. The system is a cell and its surroundings are the culture medium in which it is\nsuspended. The medium is maintained at a constant temperature of 37°C.\nc. The system is a solution contained in a sealed, thermally insulated flask.\nd. The system is a fertilized chicken egg in a constant-temperature incubator\ne. A system that exchanges no heat with its surroundings is called adiabatic. Could an\nopen system also be adiabatic? Could an adiabatic system also be closed? Explain your\nanswers.\n\n2. Equations of State. ( from SAB)\n\nA mole of n-hexane is confined in a volume of 0.5 L at 600 K. What will be the pressure\naccording to:\na. the ideal gas law?\nb. the van der Waals equation of state? For n-hexane, Tc = 507.7 K and Pc = 30.3 bar.\nc. the van der Waals equation of state correctly predicts the pressure for real n-hexane-\nwhat factors are accounted for by the van der Waals equation of state, which are\nmissing from the ideal gas law?\n\n3. Chemical Equilibrium of Ideal Gases.\nNitrogen tetroxide is partially dissociated in the gas phase according to the reaction\n\nN2O4 (g) = 2NO2(g)\n\nA mass of 1.588 g of N2O4 is placed in a 500 cm3 glass vessel at 298 K and dissociates to an\nequilibrium mixture at 1.0133 bar. (1) What are the mole fractions of N2O4 and NO2? (b) What\npercentage of the N2O4 has dissociated. Assume that the gases are ideal.\n\n4. First Law Use Applied to Ideal Gases.\nA beverage is contained in a corked bottle. A small amount of gas is present in the gap between\nthe liquid and the cork in the neck of the bottle so that the distance between the top of the liquid\nand the bottom of the cork is 1 cm and V0 = 2.5cm3. The top of the cork (Area = 2.5 cm2) is\ninitially flush with the top of the bottle. Depending on the value of P0 relative to Patm, the gas may\ndo work or the system (i.e., the person who wants the cork out) may do work in moving the cork to\nfinal position where it is just ready to leave the bottle. For the calculations below, assume that the\ncork is frictionless and that the change in potential energy of the cork is negligable (i.e., assume the\ncork has no mass). The external pressure is constant at 1 atm and the ambient temperature is 300K.\nYou may assume the gases are ideal.\n20.110J / 2.772J / 5.601J\nThermodynamics of Biomolecular Systems\nInstructors: Linda G. Griffith, Kimberly Hamad-Schifferli, Moungi G. Bawendi, Robert W. Field\n\n(a) In the first case, the beverage was fermented in\nthe bottle, generating 6 atm pressure from\nproduction of C02. If Vf = 2.5 V0, what is the final\npressure if the process is isothermal? What is the\nchange in internal energy of the gas during the\nprocess?\n\n(b) Different operators employ different methods\nof cork removal for the situation in part a. The\ncork is initially held in place by a wire mesh.\nConsider two cases - one where the mesh is\nremoved and no attempt it made by the operator to\nrestrain the cork, in which case it moves quite\nsuddenly to the \"final\" position (and then likely pops off to hit the ceiling, though that aspect is not\npart of this problem), and a second where the operator places a restraining force (e.g., a hand)\nagainst the cork and lessens the force infinitely slowly. Calculate the work done in each case. Is\nthe work positive or negative from the point of view of the operator? How much heat enters or\nleaves the gas during the process?\nliquid\nliquid\nT0, P0, V0\nTf, Pf, Vf\nInitial state\nFinal\nstate\nwork\n\n(c) Repeat part b for case 2 (slow, controlled removal) but now consider that the process occurs\nadiabatically rather than isothermally. The heat capacity of CO2 is 37 J/mol-K. What is the final\ntemperature of the gas? Does it seem realistic that the process is close to the pure adiabatic limit?\n\n(d) Compare the work done in part a and b with the work required to lift a glass of liquid weighing\n0.25 kg a distance of 0.2 m.\n\n(e) Now consider a different beverage that is not fermented in the bottle. The intial pressure in the\nhead space is 1 atm and Vf = 6V0. Calculate the work involved in moving the cork from the initial\nto the final position if the process is isothermal and the force put on the cork is increased slowly\n(i.e., process is reversible).\n\n5. Mathematical Manipulation of State Functions. (from SAB)\nThe cubic expansion coefficient is defined as\nα = 1/V (∂V/∂T)P\nand the isothermal compressibility by\nκ = -1/V (∂V/∂P)T\n(a) Calculate these quantities for an ideal gas\n(b) Write an equation of state for a liquid for which α and κ are constant?\n\n6. Surface tension and the work to create new surfaces.\n(a)(from SAB) The surface tension of water is 71.97x10-3 N m-1 or 71.97x10-3 J m-2 at 25°C.\nCalculate the surface energy in Joules of 1 mole of water dispersed as a mist containing\ndroplets of 1 μm (10-4 cm) in radius. The density of water may be taken as 1.00 g cm-3.\n\n(b) Molecules having both regions that are hydrophobic ('water-hating') and others that are\nhydrophilic ('water-loving') are known as amphiphiles. A common class of amphiphiles are\n20.110J / 2.772J / 5.601J\nThermodynamics of Biomolecular Systems\nInstructors: Linda G. Griffith, Kimberly Hamad-Schifferli, Moungi G. Bawendi, Robert W. Field\n\nsurfactants (in everyday experience, soaps), which typically have a nonpolar alkyl chain attached to\na charged and/or polar headgroup. Surfactants are so named because they tend to localize at\nsurfaces and interfaces formed between polar liquids (e.g., water) and nonpolar liquids (oils)/free\nsurfaces (e.g., a water/air interface). The presence of a surfactant at an interface can dramatically\nchange the thermodynamic properties of a system. The surface tension of of water containing 0.05\nmg/mL SDS is 60.5x10-3 mN m-1.\ni. Consider a film of water being spread across a wire frame as shown in SAB Fig 2.10.\nThe y (vertical) dimension of the frame is 5 cm while the initial x dimension of the\nfilm is 4 cm. Calculate the work required to move the bar at the left end of the film 1\ncm if the film is formed from pure water.\nii. How much more (or less) work is required to move the bar the same distance if the\nfilm is formed from a solution of SDS in water?\n\n7. Work in stretching an extracellular matrix protein.\n\nThe extracellular matrix protein fibronectin is nearly\nubiquitous in the body. Fibronectin is a large (450 Kda)\ndimer composed of homologous, repeating structural\nmotifs (classified as fibronectin repeats FN-I, FN-II, and\nFN-III) that are grouped together into functional domains\n(see http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/fibronectin/).\nCells have specific surface receptors (integrins) that bind\nto fibronectin, and they can migrate through gels or\nacross substrates that contain fibronectin. Cells pull on\nfibronectin in the matrix and can deform it, and there is\nmuch speculation on the role of the\nmechanical properties of fibronectin in\ndetermining how cells respond to a matrix\nthat contains fibronectin. Many efforts are\nunderway to reproduce properties of\nfibronectin in synthetic polymers used in\ntissue engineering. For a movie of\nfibronectin being stretched by cells in real\ntime see the class web site link to\nhttp://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/96/5/\n2153/DC1.\n\nAn example of how contiguous domains\nof fibronectin might unfold is shown in the\nfigure [from Erickson HP. Reversible unfolding\nof fibronectin type III and immunoglobulin\ndomains provides the structural basis for stretch\nand elasticity of titin and fibronectin. Proc Natl\nAcad Sci U S A. 1994 Oct 11;91(21):10114-8].\nThe diagram labeled A in the figure shows\nfive domains of fibronectin, and B shows\na time sequence of the molecule being\nstretched causing rupture and unraveling\nof the central domain. Although not\nshown, continued stretching would\nunravel additional domains.\n20.110J / 2.772J / 5.601J\nThermodynamics of Biomolecular Systems\nInstructors: Linda G. Griffith, Kimberly Hamad-Schifferli, Moungi G. Bawendi, Robert W. Field\n\nThe nature of mechanical unfolding and the forces involved can be followed using single\nforce measurements, where the molecule is attached at one end to a surface and the other\nend is pulled with a tiny cantiliver sensitive to forces in the pN range. Fernandez and\ncolleagues have used this method to investigate the stability of different domains within\nFN, and to parse the roles of specific bonds using site-directed mutagenesis [see Li L, Huang\nHH, Badilla CL, Fernandez JM. Mechanical unfolding intermediates observed by single-molecule force\nspectroscopy in a fibronectin type III module. J Mol Biol. 2005 Jan 28;345(4):817-26]. The figure to the\nright shows two separate experiments with force magnitude shown on the y-axis and the\nlength the molecule is extended from its original state is shown on the x-axis. Focusing on\nthe trace shown in figure c, the force required to stretch the molecule increases from 0 up to\n~90 pN as the molecule extends 18 nm; a domain then ruptures and the force required for\nextension decreases, then rises again as the next domain is stretched. The rupture of each\ndomain leads to a peak in the force-extension curve.\n\n(a) For the force-extension curve shown in figure c, estimate the work required to extend\nthe molecule 20 nm beyond its initial state (i.e., the work associated with the first peak).\nUse a diagram to illustrate your method. Please report the work done on fibronectin as\npositive and that done by fibronectin as negative.\n\n(b) Compare the work you calculate in part a to the work required if fibronectin acts as a\nsimple spring with a spring constant of 50 mN/m (Li F, Redick SD, Erickson HP, Moy VT. Force\nmeasurements of the alpha5beta1 integrin-fibronectin interaction. Biophys J. 2003 Feb;84(2 Pt 1):1252-62.)\nFor a simple spring, the force exerted by the spring in response to perturbation is Fs = -k (x-\nx0) where k is the spring constant (in units of F/length) and x0 is the unstressed position of\nthe spring (the + x direction corresponds to stretching the spring). In figure c, \"x - x0\"\ncorresponds to the magnitude of the displacement (plotted on the x-axis), and the force (y-\naxis) is the force exerted by the probe (i.e., opposite in sign to the force of the spring).\nUsing the value of the work you calculated in part a, estimate the spring constant for\nfibronectin (you will need to derive an analytical expression relating the spring constant to\nwork, starting with the definition of Fs above). Do you get 50mN/m? Does the shape of the\nforce-displacement curve provide insight into why your answer might be different?\n\n8. First Law, work, heat.\nA sample consisting of 1 mole of a monatomic\nideal gas (for which\nV\nC =\nR ) is taken through\nthe path (solid line) shown in the figure at right.\n(a) Determine the temperature at 1, 2, and 3. (b)\nCalculate q, w, ∆U and ∆H for each step and for\nthe overall path. If a numerical answer cannot\nbe obtained from the information given, then\nwrite in + (positive), - (negative), or ? (can't\ntell) as appropriate.\n\n20.110J / 2.772J / 5.601J\nThermodynamics of Biomolecular Systems\nInstructors: Linda G. Griffith, Kimberly Hamad-Schifferli, Moungi G. Bawendi, Robert W. Field\n\n9. First Law and Path Dependence of Work and Heat.\n\nWhen a system is taken from state A to state\nB along the path ACB in the figure at right,\n80 J of heat flows into the system and the\nsystem does 30 J of work. (a) How much\nheat flows into the system along path ADB\nif the work done is 10J? (b) When the\nsystem is returned from state B to A along\nthe curved path, the work done on the\nsystem is 20J. Does the system absorb or\nliberate heat, and how much? (c) If UD - UA\n= +40J, find the heat absorbed in the\nprocesses AD and DB.\n\n10. First law and Equivalence of Work and Heat.\nYou want to heat 1 kg of water 10oC, and you have the following four methods under\nconsideration. The heat capacity of water is 4.184 J K-1 g-1.\n\n(a) You can heat it with a mechanical eggbeater that is powered by a 1-kg mass on a rope\nover a pulley. How far does the mass have to descend in the earth's gravitational field to\nsupply enough work?\n(b) You can send 1 A through a 100-Ω resistor. How long will it take?\n(c) You can send the water through a solar collector that has an area of 1 m2. How long will\nit take if the sun's intensity on the collector is a 4 J cm-2 min-1?\n(d) You can make a charcoal fire. The heat of combustion of graphite is -393 kJ mol-1. That\nis, 12 g of graphite will produce 393 kJ of heat when it is burned to CO2(g) at constant\npressure. How much charcoal will have to burn?\n\nAdditional Practice Problems (not graded):\n\n1.\n6.0 moles of molecular hydrogen are contained in a 1.0 L cylinder at 30°C.\n\nCalculate the pressure in bar according to:\n\n(a) the ideal gas law\n\n(b) the van der Waals equation. The van der Waals constants for H2 are a = 0.2476 L2 bar\nmol-2 and b = 0.02661 L mol-1. Assuming that the van der Waals equation gives the right\nanswer, what is the percent error in using the ideal gas law?\n\n2. (a) Two moles of an ideal gas initially at 50 °C and 10 bar are expanded isothermally and\nreversibly to a final volume of 30 L. Calculate the final pressure, the heat, the work and ∆U\nin the change of state.\n\n(b) Two moles of an ideal gas initially at 50 °C and 10 bar are expanded isothermally\nagainst vacuum (external pressure of 0 bar) to a final volume of 30 L. Calculate the final\npressure, the heat, the work and ∆U in the change of state.\n\n20.110J / 2.772J / 5.601J\nThermodynamics of Biomolecular Systems\nInstructors: Linda G. Griffith, Kimberly Hamad-Schifferli, Moungi G. Bawendi, Robert W. Field\n\n(c) Two moles of an ideal gas initially at 50 °C and 10 bar are expanded isothermally\nagainst a pressure of 1 bar to a final volume of 30 L. Calculate the final pressure, the heat,\nthe work and ∆U in the change of state.\n\n3. A chemical reaction takes place in a container of cross-sectional area 50.0 cm2. As a result of the\nreaction, a piston is pushed out through 15 cm against an external pressure of 121 kPa. Calculate\nthe work done by the system. (Assume all gases are ideal).\n\n4.

Calculate the work done when the system expands (a) isothermally against a\npressure of 1.0 atm, and (b) isothermally and reversibly to the same volume as in (a). (Assume\nall gases are ideal).\n\n6. Show that the differential of df is inexact.\ndf = dx -x\ny dy\nThus, the integral ∫ df depends on the path. However, we can define a new function g by\ndg = 1\ny df\nwhich has the property that dg is exact. Show that dg is exact, so that\ndg = 0\n∫\n\n7.

Give a brief explanation for each and if false provide a counter example:\n\n(a) The enthalpy of a system is always greater than its internal energy.\n\n(b) In the reversible isothermal expansion of a real gas, the energy remains constant.\n\n(c) In the reversible adiabatic expansion of a real gas, the enthalpy always decreases.\n\n(d) At a given temperature and volume, the pressure of one mole of a real gas is always\nless than the pressure of one mole of an ideal gas.\n\n(e) The work done by a gas in an irreversible expansion from state 1 to state 2 is always\nless than the work done by a gas in a reversible expansion from state 1 to state 2.\n\n2. State Functions: An ideal monotonic gas is initially at the following conditions: V = 0.5L,\np = 1bar, T = 298K (State 0). It is subjected to the following cycle, where each step\nbetween states is reversible:\n\nStep 1: Isothermal expansion to 1 L (State 1)\nStep 2: Adiabatic expansion to 1.5 L (State 2)\nStep 3: Isothermal compression to 0.75 L (State 3)\nStep 4: Adiabatic compression to 0.5 L (State 0)\n\nCalculate the heat, work, and change in internal energy for the gas at each step.

State Functions: The thermo-mechanical properties of certain proteins play an important\nrole in response of cells to perturbations in the mechanical environment and to other forms\nof stress. A protein derived from the supporting skeleton of the red cell membrane is\nsubjected to the following cycle conducted at constant pressure, starting from State 0,\nwhere the protein is in an unstressed state at T= 298 K.\n\nStep 1.

Two metal balls, one gold and one aluminum (1 mole\nof each), both initially at a temperature of 25°C, are placed in a beaker of water on a hot\nplate and allowed to equilibrate at 100°C (the temperature of the heat bath)- step (i). The\ntwo marbles are then removed and placed immediately onto two different strips of wax (1\nmole of wax each, the wax is\ninitially at room temperature)\nstretched over a can (illustrated\nbelow).The Au ball melts through\nthe wax strip and falls into the can,\nwhile the Al marble remains on the\nwax without melting it (step (ii)).\nAll of these processes are occurring\nat a constant pressure of 1 atm.\nWhat's going on here? Let's explain\nit step by step. The heat capacities\nof the wax and two metals are\napproximately constant over the temperature ranges of interest. Note that the thermal\nconductivity of both metals is very high- the observed result is not occurring due to a\ndifference in the kinetics of heat transfer. The Al marble will never melt through the wax!\n\nheater\na. What heat transfers are occurring in the described processes? (qualitatively).\n\nb. Write equations that would allow you to quantitatively calculate the heat\ntransferred into the Au marble and the heat transferred into the Al marble for\nstep (i). What information must you be given to finish the calculation? Will the\nheat transferred to the Au marble equal the heat transferred to the Al marble?\n\nc. Assume whatever heat that leaves the Al marble in step (ii) enters the wax strip\nit sits on (none is lost to the surroundings). According to the zeroth law, the Al\nmarble and wax strip will have the same final temperature at equilibrium. Write\nan expression for the final temperature Tf of the Al marble and wax strip as a\nfunction of their molar heat capacities, C p\nAland C p\nwax.\n\nd.

Assume the\nheat capacities are approximately constant over the temperature ranges of interest.\n\ne. Aerobic respiration culminates in the conversion of glucose and oxygen into CO2,\nwater, and energy:\n\nGlucose(aq)+ O2(g) = CO2(g) + H2O(l)\n\nHow much is heat is liberated per mole of reaction at 298 K?\n\nf. Anaerobic respiration in humans takes over in conditions where oxygen is limiting. The\nmetabolic pathway leads to the conversion of glucose to lactic acid:\n\nGlucose(aq) = lactic acid(aq)\n\nHow much heat is liberated per mole of the anaerobic reaction at 298 K? What is the\nratio aerobic: anaerobic of enthalpies produced per mole of glucose by the two\npathways?\n\ng. In vivo, these reactions of course occur at the physiological temperature of 37°C.

Explosive compounds are molecules (or materials) in which the oxidizer\nand the fuel are contained in the same molecule. This leads to a rapid, highly exothermic,\nself-sustaining reaction, which results in large increases in pressure and temperature (i.e. a\nshock wave). Examples of explosives that are in common use are TNT, RDX, and\nnitroglycerine (NG).\n\nMe\nNO 2\nNO 2\nO2N\n\nNO2\nNO2\nO2N\nN\nN\nN\nNO 2\nNO 2\nO2 N\nCH\nCH 2\nCH 2\nO\nO\nO\n\nTNT\n\nRDX\n\nNG\n\nC7H5(NO2)3\n\nC3H6N6O6\n\nC3H5(NO3)3\n\nMW = 227\n\nMW = 222\n\nMW = 227\n\nHeats of formation for these compounds are:\n\n∆Hf° (TNT) = -35.5 kJ/mole ∆Hf°(RDX) = +61.5 kJ/mole ∆Hf°(NG) = -354.4\nkJ/mole\n\n(a) Calculate the heats of explosion for each of these materials, that is, the enthalpy\nchange when each undergoes spontaneous decomposition to stable gaseous products. Assume\nthat the balanced reactions that take place are:\n\nTNT:\nC7H5(NO2)3 (s) Æ (5/2) H2O (g) + (3/2) N2(g) + (7/2) CO(g) + (7/2) C(s)\n\nRDX: C3H6N6O6 (s) Æ 3 H2O (g) + 3 N2(g) + 3 CO(g)\n\nNG: C3H5(NO3)3 (l) Æ (5/2) H2O (g) + (1/4) O2(g) + (3/2)N2(g) + 3 CO2(g)\n\nAssume that all species are at p = 1 bar and T = 25° C (298 K).

Calorimetry. An aqueous solution of unoxygenated hemoglobin containing 5.00 g of\nprotein (M ≈ 64,000 g mol-1) in 100 cm3 of solution is placed in an insulated vessel. When\nenough molecular oxygen is added to the solution to completely saturate the hemoglobin,\nthe temperature rises 0.031oC. Each mole of hemoglobin binds exactly 4 moles of oxygen.\nWhat is the enthalpy of reaction per mole of oxygen bound? The heat capacity of the\nsolution may be assumed to be 4.18 J K-1 cm-3.\n\n9. Calorimetry. The enzyme catalase catalyses the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide by\nthe following endothermic reaction:\n\nH2O2 (aq)\n=\ncatalase\nH2O(l) + (1/2)O2(g)\n\nEstimate the minimum detectable concentration of hydrogen peroxide if a small amount\nof catalase (solid) is added to 1L of a hydrogen peroxide solution in a calorimeter at 298\nK. Assume that the temperature rise of 0.02°C can be distinguished. The specific heat\ncapacity of the hydrogen peroxide solution is a constant: 4.18 kJ K-1 kg-1. The standard\nenthalpy of formation of hydrogen peroxide is -191.7 kJ/mole, and the standard\nenthalpies of formation of water and oxygen were provided in problem 3.\n\n(2-23 p. 64 Tinoco, Sauer, and Wang, Physical Chemistry: Principles and Applications\nin Biological Sciences, 3rd ed., Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey (1995))\n\n10. Differential Scanning Calorimetry.\n\nProteins unfold from their native (folded) state to a denatured (unfolded) state around a\ntemperature Tm (called the melting temperature). The unfolding process requires an input of\nheat (∆Hunfolding>0).\n\nnative = unfolded\n\nA Differential Scanning Calorimeter (DSC) is an instrument which measures the heat\nabsorption of a sample as a function of temperature. A solution of a protein and a reference\nsolution (solvent only) are placed in an insulated chamber at constant pressure. The samples\nare heated so that the temperatures increase at a constant rate of 1°C/min. When the protein\nsample undergoes the transition from native to unfolded, some of the heat is used to drive\nthe unfolding instead of raising the temperature. The instrument varies the applied power to\nthe protein sample so that the two cells are maintained at the same temperature. The\nexperiment measures the heat transferred into the solutions per unit time. Since dq=CpdT,\nand dT is constant per unit time by design, the experiment measures an apparent Cp.\nConsequently the protein solution effectively experiences a sharp increase in apparent heat\ncapacity Cp (see figure) during the transition. The applied power (in J/(K min)) as a function\nof temperature can be converted to the Cp of the protein sample (J/(K mol)) if the molecular\nweight and protein concentration is known.\n\nThe change in Cp upon unfolding, ∆Cp, is the difference in the baselines before and after the\ntransition. The midpoint of the peak is the melting temperature, Tm.\n\n20.110J / 2.772J / 5.601J\nThermodynamics of Biomolecular Systems\nInstructors: Linda G. Griffith, Kimberly Hamad-Schifferli, Moungi G.

Sketch in the\nfigure, or describe in words or in a mathematical relation how you would obtain ∆Hunfolding from\ninformation obtained in a DSC experiment.\n\nb) The unfolding temperature, Tm, for a protein can be changed by varying pH or other solvent\nconditions. The protein cytochrome c is measured to have ∆Hunfolding = 368 kJ/mol at 70 °C and\n∆Hunfolding = 210 kJ/mol at 50 °C. Calculate ∆Cp (Cp,unfolded-Cp,native) for cytochrome c, assuming\n∆Cp is constant over this temperature range.

Assume air is a mixture of N2 and O2 in a 4 to 1 molar ratio. Assume\nalso that the flame burns under adiabatic and constant pressure conditions.

In Problem 1 you plotted the extent of reaction at equilibrium against the total pressure for\nthe dissociation of N2 O4 (g) to NO2 (g). You found that ξeq decreases as p increases, in\naccord with Le Chatelier's principle. Now let's introduce n\nmoles of an inert gas into\nthe system.

Given 20 naturally occurring amino acids, what is the probability that the amino acid\nsequence ELVIS occurs in a stretch of a protein sequence?\nb.) What is the probability if the order of the amino acids did not matter, i.e., VLSEI, etc.?\n2.) Levinthal's Paradox:\nCyrus Levinthal, a former MIT professor, claimed that proteins can not go from unfolded to\nfolded state by sampling of all possible states. He claimed that it would take way too long for a\nprotein to fold if they were to sample all possible conformations (proteins fold on the order of\n~ms to ~μs). Assume that a protein has 100 amino acids and each amino acid has two degrees of\nfreedom (angles of rotation called φ and ψ), also assume that it takes a femtosecond to sample\neach conformation. Using simple statistics show that Prof. Levinthal was indeed right and that it\nwould take a very long time (much longer than our lifetimes!) if the protein was to sample all\npossible conformations. If proteins were to fold by sampling all possible states, calculate the\nchange in entropy upon folding, assume that the unfolded state has all the possible states and the\nfolded state is unique (i.e there is only one folded state).

What are the energies of the third and the fifth energy\nlevel relative to the ground state, relative to the first excited state?\n8) Denaturation occurs over a temperature range.\nAn important prediction we can make with simple statistical mechanical models is the\ndependence of protein folding on temperature. Let's show this for a variation on the polypeptide\nmodel we used in class.

Just as macroscopic liquids can phase separate if\nmixing is thermodynamically unfavorable, mixtures of lipids within a lipid bilayer can undergo a\ntwo-dimensional phase separation, segregating into separate domains, as illustrated below.

Consider a 2D lattice lattice as a model of one leaflet of a lipid\nbilayer, which contains two different lipids, modeled as beads that\npack into the lattice just as we have modeled 3D liquids, as\nillustrated in the figure below.

Prediction of phase separation from interfacial tension: t-Butanol is layered on the top of\nelectrophoresis gels to prevent evaporation during the process. The interfacial tension between\nbutanol and water has been measured as 2 dyn/cm (0.002 kg/s2) at 20C.\na. At this temperature, what is the maximum mole fraction of water that can be dissolved in\nbutanol? You may assume that the interfacial area of a molecule is a = 9 x 10-20 m2 and\nthat the effective coordination number z = 8. At this temperature kT = 4 x 10-21 J (note\nthat 1 J = 1 kg-m2/s2).\nb.

Consider the problem of how plants might lift water from ground level\nto their leaves.

Dialysis is common laboratory procedure used to remove low molecular weight solutes from\nprotein solutions. Example situations include: removal of removal of free, unreacted label after\nfluorescently labeling a protein; and removal of urea from a denatured protein solution to allow\nrefolding of the protein. The protein solution is sealed inside a dialysis bag or tubing and placed in\ncontainer with a large excess of pure water, as shown in the figure. The system is then allowed to\ncome to equilibrium. For this problem, consider an idealized system where the only solute in the\ndialysis bag is the low molecular weight solute (i.e., no protein is actually present.)\n(a) Explain why the combined system of the protein solution (system \"A\") and the water\n(system \"B\") may be considered to be an isolated system.\n(b) Use a lattice model, with each individual water molecule occupying a single site in the\nlattice, to show that the entropy of System B is zero at the start of the experiment.\nDesignate the number of water molecules NWB and the number of total lattice sites MB.\n(c) Use a lattice model to express the entropy of system A at the start of the experiment in\nterms of the number of water molecules in system A, NwA, the number of solute particles,\nNs, and the total number of lattice sites in system A, MA.

Field\n20.110/2.772/5.601 & 20.114\nHomework #8\nDue Friday, Nov 18, 3 pm\n1. The Subtle Effects of Phase Partitioning.\nx\na. In class we expressed the partition coefficient KA\nB = xsB . Values of partition coefficients are\nsA\nB\nusually reported as KA = csB . Show what the relationship is between the two expressions,\ncsA\nusing appropriate physicochemical properties of the components A & B.\nb. Most mammalian cells, when placed in culture, adhere to the proteins adsorbed on the\nsurface of the culture substrate via specific cell surface receptors called integrins. If the cells\nare plated at low density, they can migrate around the surface through a process of extending\na lamellopod, forming new adhesions to the substrate, loosening adhesions at the rear, and\nthen contracting (via the actin-myosin cytoskeleton), which detaches the rear of the cell and\nlets it move forward. The process of cell migration is extremely important in development,\nwound healing, cancer progression, and response to infection. The migration process can be\nstudied by time lapse video microscopy.\nIn a common experimental set-up, a Petri dish is placed on a warmed microscope stage and\nthe cells are photographed every 5 min for 12-24 hr. To prevent evaporation of the culture\nmedium during this time, a ~1 mm thick layer of mineral oil is layered on top of the culture\nmedium. Water has a very low solubility in mineral oil.\nSeveral students in a particular laboratory successfully measured migration of fibroblasts\nusing this method, and found it to be robust. However, a when a new student started to\nmeasure migration behavior of liver cells, the cells died rapidly. The liver cell culture\nmedium contains a steroid hormone that is essential for normal cell behavior. The steroid has\noil\na partition coefficient Kwater = cs,oil\n= 34 and is present in the culture medium at an initial\ncs,water\nconcentration of 10 nM.\nIf the depth of the culture medium is 3 mm and the thickness of the mineral oil layer is 1 mm,\nwhat is the concentration of steroid in the culture medium after equilibrium between the oil\nand the medium is established?\n2. Free Energy of Mixing Polymers. Free radical polymerization processes are often easy to carry\nout, but the product is typically polydisperse in molecular weight. In other words, the product contains\nmolecules with molecular weight 2n, 3n, 4n, 5n.....100n (or greater) where n is the molecular weight of\nthe monomer. It is thus often desirable to purify the product to remove the low molecular weight\ncomponents. Explain why cooling the polymer solution can precipitate the higher molecular weight\n\n20.110J / 2.772J / 5.601J\nThermodynamics of Biomolecular Systems\nInstructors: Linda G. Griffith, Kimberly Hamad-Schifferli, Moungi G. Bawendi, Robert W. Field\nmolecules preferentially compared to the lower molecular weight molecules (and you may assume that\nthe cooling is done by a series of quasi-equilibrium steps).\n3. Polymer sizes. You are interested in using a biological polymer, heparan sulfate, as a polymeric\nprodrug- a polymer used as a carrier with drug molecules conjugated to the chain- for treatment of\ncancer (illustrated by the schematic below). The size of the polymer coil in solution will determine\nwhether or not the conjugate will stay in the bloodstream for extended periods or be rapidly filtered\nout by the kidneys, and thus is a key parameter to optimize. The chemical structure of heparan\nsulfate is also given below. The anionic sulfate groups are sensitive to the pH of the chain's\nsurroundings- at lower pH, the sulfate groups become protonated (uncharged). Using your\nexpressions for polymer coil dimensions and the following data, answer the questions below:\nbond length in chain = b = 0.15 nm\ncharacteristic ratio at pH 7.4 = 6.4\na. The root-mean-square end-to-end distance of the heparan sulfate you are using is found to be\n32 nm in pH 7.4 aqueous solution. Given this result, calculate the number of bonds N in the\nchain for the 'stiff' freely jointed chain model (this is not an ideal chain).\nb. Based on the data from part (a), what is the Kuhn length and number of Kuhn segments NK\nfor the chain at pH 7.4?\nc. When the chain is dissolved in pH 9.0 aqueous solution, more of the sulfate groups of the\nchain become ionized. The measured end-to-end distance under these conditions is 55 nm.\nHow many real bonds make up one Kuhn segment length under these conditions?\n4. Dill and Bromberg # 32-4\n5.

An 'ideal' solvent expands a polymer chain. (Dill and Bromberg 32-4)\nIf a polymer chain is composed of the same monomer units as the solvent around it, the\nsystem will be ideal in the sense that the polymer-polymer interactions will be identical\nto polymer-solvent interactions, so = 0.\n(a) Write an expression for the most probable radius R for a chain in an ideal solvent.\n(b) Show that such a chain is expanded relative to a random-flight chain.\n(c) Describe the difference between an ideal solvent and a -solvent.\n5.

A series of PEO polymers has been synthesized by living anionic polymerization, a process which results in\na product with near-uniform molecular weight (in contrast to free-radical polymerization, which results in\nhighly polydisperse polymer, as discussed on the last homework set). The molecular weight of the PEO repeat\nunit is 44 gm/mol. The polymers are characterized by osmotic pressure measurements and light scattering in a\ntheta solvent, where it is known that chains assume an ideal conformation, at 300K. The following data are\nreported for the osmotic pressure determined under limiting dilution conditions (2.5 gm/L) and the radius of\ngyration (Rg) of each polymer in the series where Rg = r0\n2 1/ 2\n6 .\n\nSample\nπ (atm)\nRg (nm)\nP1\n1.8 x 10-4\n0.7\nP2\n1 x 10-5\n2.0\nP3\n2 x 10-6\n6.8\nP4\n3.9 x 10-7\n15.2\n\n(a) Determine the molecular weight of each sample P1-P4.\n\n(b) What is the Kuhn segment length (bk) for PEO, as determined by these data?\n\n(c) A cell surface integrin receptor is capable of exerting a force of ~0.1 pN. Imagine that this receptor\nbinds to one end of the PEO chains described above, and the other end is fixed. How far would the cell\nbe able to move the ends apart, for each of the chains P1-P4? In reality, PEO is often used to \"tether\"\nadhesion molecules to solid surfaces to induce cell adhesion. Although the behavior of a chain with one\nend fixed to a solid plane is different than a random coil, these estimates are within the magnitude of\nwhat would be expected in that situation.\n\n2. #32.7 from Dill and Bromberg (delayed from PS8). Figure 32-12 shows the stress-strain properties of a\nrubber band (presume the temperature is 25°C).

A crosslinked hyaluronic acid gel strip weighing 1 gm is 4 cm long with a cross sectional area of 0.25 cm2\nand can be modeled as having a spring constant of 0.05 N/m.\n(a) estimate the work required to stretch the gel 4 cm in the x-direction at a constant temperature of 300\nK if the work is reversible\n(b) As discussed in class, the internal energy change for stretching a polymer chain (or network of\nchains) is approximately zero. Show that when a chain (or the polymer gel) is stretched in an\nisothermal process, heat must be exchanged with the environment, and indicate whether the polymer\ngives off heat or adsorbs heat as it is stretched.\n(c) Estimate the value of reversible heat adsorbed or released by the process in part (a). If the gel has a\nheat capacity of 4 J/K, how much would the temperature of the gel change if the heat associated with\nthe process were used to change the temperature of the gel?\n\n4. The simple dissociation of water is influenced by the presence of salts due to induced ordering of the H+ and\nOH- ions by the salt ions.

At what temperature is the concentration of dimers 90% of the maximum possible?\n\nc. In fact, half of the initial complementary sequence is degraded to the following two shorter\noligomers: 5'-CATG-3' and 5'-TTCG-3'.

(from Tinoco et al, Physical Chemistry, 4th Ed, Ex 2.1) Measurements with single DNA\nmolecules in aqueous solution gave the data in the figure:\nIn this experiment, the DNA used was that of a virus called . (P. Cluzel, A. Lebrun, C.\nHeller, R. Lavery, J.-L. Vivoy, D. Chatenay, and F. Caron, 1996. DNA: an extensible molecule.\nScience, 271, 792-794). One end of a double stranded DNA, which has about 50,000 base pairs,\nwas attached to an optical fiber, which would bend when pulled and served as a force sensor; the\nother end of the DNA was attached to a device termed a piezo translator which would move the\nattached DNA end by a distance in proportion of the voltage applied to the device. The measured\nforce, in pN, is shown in the figure as a function of r, the distance between the ends of a DNA\nmolecule, divided by the contour length of the DNA. A ratio r of 1.00 corresponds to an actual\nend-to-end separation of about 15 μm, the countour length l0 of an unstretched DNA.\nWhen the force is zero, the separation between the ends is less than l0, as the unperturbed DNA\nmolecule is coiled up rather than extended. The DNA extends readily to its contour length (r = 1)\nby the application of a small force, and thereafter the force rises more rapidly until a plateau is\nreached around 80 pN. The presence of this plateau suggests a tension-induced structural\ntransition of the DNA, the length of which can be increased by at least 60% from that of the\nwell-known Watson-Crick B-form of DNA. Stretching beyond an r of 1.7 leads to irreversible\nchanges in the DNA.\nCalculate the total work done on (a) a single DNA molecule when it is stretched from r = 1 to\nr = 1.6 and (b) 1 mole of DNA molecules."

The rigid semipermeable membrane is permeable to\nwater. For this problem, you may assume that the concentration of solute in the osmotic\nregion, cs , remains constant at 0.7 M (this is approximately true as the volume of the drug\nregion is very small compared to the volume of the osmotic region).\nCalculate the net pressure exerted on the drug region (i.e., the pressure on the impermeable\npouch membrane minus the pressure of the external fluid) when the device comes to\nequilibrium with the following external fluids:\na. Pure water\nb. 0.2 M sucrose, where sucrose does not cross the semipermeable membrane\nc. 0.2 M sucrose, where sucrose is able to cross the semipermeable membrane\nd. 0.1 M MgCl2, where MgCl2 does not cross the semipermeable membrane.\nYou may use the dilute solution assumption for these calculations. Assume constant body\ntemperature=37oC.\n\nImage removed due to copyright reasons.\n20.110J / 2.772J / 5.601J\nThermodynamics of Biomolecular Systems\nInstructors: Linda G.

In class we studied the mixing of species A and B, assuming both of them as polar\nsubstances (such that they make hydrogen bonds with each other and also with their own\nkind). Now assume that we have a three species system, A, B and C. Assume that for such a\nlattice model, N = nA + nB + nC. All sites are filled.\na. Write an expression for entropy of mixing.\nb. Using the mean field (\"Bragg-Williams\") approximation, where we assume that the\nparticles on a lattice are mixed as uniformly and randomly as possible, write an\nexpression for the energy of mixing (ΔUmix) in terms of the binary interactions\nparameters chi (ΧAB, ΧAC, ΧBC).\nc. Write an expression for the free energy of mixing (in Helmholtz free energy).\nd. Write an expression for the chemical potentials of substances A, B and C.\ne. Now assume that the species A is polar, while species B and C are nonpolar and\nform very weak inter-species (AC, BC etc) bonds. What do you think will happen to the\nfree energy of the system, relative to the situation when all species were polar? What\nwould happen to the entropy of the system?\n\n20.110J / 2.772J / 5.601J\nThermodynamics of Biomolecular Systems\nInstructors: Linda G. Griffith, Kimberly Hamad-Schifferli, Moungi G.

Let's compare the magnitude of entropic forces that favor unfolding of proteins (gain in\nchain conformations) to the entropic forces favoring folding (hydrophobic ordering of water\naround exposed nonpolar side chains):\nConsider a protein of 200 amino acid units. Let's estimate the entropy gain due to chain\nconformations when the chain goes from a compact, unique folded state to a random coil.\nUsing the lattice model approximation, we showed in lecture that one could estimate the\nnumber of states for a random coil on a 3D lattice as:\nΩ = zN\nWhere N is the number of repeat units (200). If we take the folded state as a unique single\nstate for the folded protein, we have the following for the entropy change on\ndenaturation:\nN ⎞\n⎞\n⎛ z\n⎛ Ωunfolded\nS\nΔ chain freedom = kB ln ⎜⎜⎝ Ω folded ⎠⎟⎟ = kB ln ⎜⎝ 1 ⎠⎟ = k\n\nN\n\nln z\nB\nJ\nS\nΔ chain freedom = 1.381×10-23 J (200) ln(6) = 4.95 ×10-21 J = 2979\n⋅\nK\nK\n\nK\n\nmol\n\nNow, from measurements of individual amino acids, we can approximate that the average\nentropy loss when a nonpolar amino acid is exposed to water as 100 J/mole K. Using this\nvalue, what fraction f of amino acids in the protein chain would need to be nonpolar in order\nto provide enough 'hydrophobic entropy loss' to exactly balance the entropy gain from chain\nconformations during unfolding?"

Measurement of partition coefficients: You add 1 mg of a bile acid with a molecular weight\nof 400 to a small vial containing 1 mL of a model oil that represents cell membranes and 1\nmL of 0.1M NaCl in water.

We derived in class the end-to-end distance of the freely-\njointed chain model of polymers, which makes use of an extremely simple set of assumptions\nto determine the polymer chain conformation. The model turns out to be very useful for real\nrandom coil polymers because we can re-scale the polymer chain, viewing a stiff polymer\nchain with N segments of length b as an ideal chain that has a smaller number of segments\nNk that have a longer length bk, to account for the tendency of stiff chains to have runs of\nbonds that largely point in the same direction in space.\nRecently, the persistence length (which is equivalent to twice the Kuhn's statistical segment\nlength bk) of a major glycosaminoglycan polymer component of cartilage was characterized\nby a research team in Materials Science and Biological Engineering here at MIT, by\nadsorbing the polymers to a substrate and directly imaging the individual (very large, by\npolymer standards) macromolecules using atomic force microscopy (L. Ng et al., J. Struct.\nBiol. 143, 242-257 (2003)). Two AFM images of the molecules, aggrecans, are shown below.\nAggrecans have a 'bottle-brush' molecular structure, with a linear polymer backbone and side\nchains that extend away from the backbone. The two images above are from fetal and adult\ncartilage. The following data were collected for these molecules:\nImages removed due to copyright reasons.\nPlease see:\nFigure 7A in Ng, L., et al. J Struct Biol 143 (2003): 242-257.\nThe bond length of these molecules b is 1.2 nm.\na. Calculate the characteristic ratio for adult aggrecan molecules.\nb. Calculate the number of effective bonds in the fetal aggrecan molecule, NK.\nc. How many real bonds along the aggrecan backbone are included within one Kuhn\nsegment of the aggrecan polymer?\nd.
